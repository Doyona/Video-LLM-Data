In its own way, this movie is as over the top as classic 80s action flicks... God it felt good.

Was that JIMMY from John Wick😂😂😂
Just watched this last night, after seeing the 2nd one advertised. One of the best films I've watched in a long time! Could definitely watch it again and probably again in the future.  Silly funny sense of humour, good action, good music, and good acting. The old dad at the end was hilarious..like a kid in a candy shop, so funny.  We will definitely be going to watch the 2nd one and support it.
john wick and saul should do a film tgth

WE NEED MORE MOVIES WITH SAUL GOOD MAN
He is so iconic as a lawyer, you can't see him acting like a different person...
Saul Goodman ain’t playing aroumd

Alele Polame Alele Polame hey 😂😂😂
Came to watch after the phenomenal Nobody 2. This was good as well, but with a slow start. When it picked up it really picked up though. I like how they kept the wife's story ambiguous. She seems like she's on the down low too, and then she's gluing a major knife wound. This was a bit bloodier than #2. I appreciated #2 wasn't as graphic although it was just as incredibly fun and inventive in the fights. It was a good idea to keep the Nobody formula from film to film, kind of played us with nostalgia.
1:12 coolie trailer 😂😂😂

Why he didn’t do that to Walter white when he was trying to intimidate him
How is it in the trailer that 2:31 is a grenade but in the movie it's a jar or whatever it was
Who here after seeing the new movie trailer coming aug. 15
He is mad after losing to howard
This movie was suprisingly good 👍
Watched this last night and dmn it's sooooo good! this is my 2nd top fave action movie, next to John Wick. And Oh I heard there's a sequel coming on Aug 2025, can't wait😆😆.
Lot's of choreographed fights. Bloke wins against multiple opponents in unrealistic ways. Novel idea for a film
Son n e body
When someone steals your daughter’s Kitty Kat bracelet then you Better Call Saul!
Bob Odenkirk is this generation’s version of Bruce Willis.  Now if we could just find this generation’s version of Alan Rickman, we might get this generation’s version of Die Hard.
Is this Saul Goodman 😮?
I love, love this movie and just found out that "NOBODY 2" comes out on Aug 15th!! Woot woo!!!!
I watched this trailer before watching BCS, I thought, "huh, actually a non-familiar face calling himself a nobody, and i think he pulled off a good mid-age dangerous guy", now that i have seen BCS, i can't get jimmy out of this clip...
I never know Saul is such a kickass!
0:02 It’s this again!
These are the kind of movies I want to make.
this was the moment saul became the bay harbor assasin
They need to stop showing the whole movie in the trailers. I watched Nobody before seeing the trailer and I'm glad. At least I got to enjoy the surprises.
Marzenie karzdego z nas po 40stce
What’s the name of that soundtrack?
Insane!
Nobody 2 on the way!!
Great movie, im shocked I missed it when it came out!
Odenkirk mode initiated
Soooo... John Wick if his wife had lived and they had a family. Got it!
He is Soul good man
So never heard of this movie just watch half of it because tomorrow i have work but 10 of 10    30 mins left
Me ? Nobody !  Where did I hear those words ?
Nobody 2 is better...
John Wick’s life if his wife had lived.
who's here after watching the new movie trailer!
"Me? I'm nobody" reminds me of Lalo from "Better Call Saul".
Who is here from the Nobody 2 trailer xD
2:27 Nah, this even more petty that John Wick's dog. GIVE THIS MAN HIS DAUGHTER'S KITTY CAT BRACELET 🗣
Anybody back here after the new trailer released???
Bye evil bang 💥💥 2:36
john wick for dog Nobody for kitty bracelet
Imagine...the version of Saul Goodman after his retirement 😂😂😂
he is such a good actor but this movie is utter **** ... action doesn't suit him at all
I watched this first before even knowing John Wick,  Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. This initiate my love for the 3 shows/movie I mentioned 😂
Better don't call Saul
Nobody is everybody's favourite
Better call Saul, I'm gonna f...,
❤excellent movie watching it again
So heres what happened, saul goodman escaped jail and called the dissapearer for 'a dust filter for my hoover maxextract pro model 60' again where he was given this identity. But he already broke bad so it was time until he become this character. Its basically a sequel of breaking bad lol
So THAT'S what he did in Omaha! :P
Great movie I'm watching it again!
What a fantastic actor he is. I never knew he was so talented. I just finished watching this movie and it was absolutely fantastic. The action scenes are legendary, the acting is superb, and the direction is excellent keeping you engaged throughout. I love the dialogue, "You brought so many shotguns, you brought so many Russians!" It is a funny, entertaining, and an outstanding action movie.
Is it me or just the main character talks/sounds like Jordan Peterson.
Actually disappointed the trailer didn’t fully match the movie. John Wick had the depth of character and the dog was the tipping point.  This was missing that element. Still liked the trailer more than the movie.
This is not the original right?
THEY JUST ANNOUNCED NOBODY 2!!!!
No way jimmy McGill is gonna do that 😂
Who’s going to the private screening tonight for the second movie ?
This movie is craaazzzyyy!!!! 10!!! 💥💥💥💥👏👏👏👏
I need that trailer for nobody 2
Better call saul 😂
GREAT ACTION MOVIE 💥......
Better call saul
I found my favorite action movie.
Ahahhaha is like John Wick is dead and this is the brother ahahahah i think nobody 2 is coming nobody 3 is in Italy ahahhaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 like EQUALİZER AHAHAHA come one man this is Better Call Saul man comedy man pfff lol
Saul ❤
oh, Ethiopian! I'm Russian! don't push it on us, it's obvious from a mile away that you were a cannibal :)
This is John Wick's stepbrother, Craig Wick.
I would love a simple, small pc game made from Nobody.  Maybe 56 small episodes, one for every week and 4 for the celebration days.  Bob is a perfect Game Character (and all the staff behind him, too) in the upmost positive way.
After this im definitely calling better call saul
Nobody. No. Body.
Бухгалтер милый мой бухгалтер 😂❤❤❤

Awesome movie! Worth the watch.
Ahhh... he's an "auditor." Like Elon Musk!
Espero con ansia la segunda parte nadie 2😊😊
Better Call Ambulance wewewew
This reminds me of Michael Scarn "clean up in aisle 5"
if saul didn't go back to being a lawyer
You know its a good movie, when you watch it a few times, then a few years later, watch the trailer.
1:12 Song name ??
Wonderful. He can do no wrong with me.
One of the best movies in the last 10 years. Extremely good acting performance by Bob Odenkirk!
I don't want a lead who thinks he's nobody. I want a badass lead who knows he's a badass.
Hello, can somebody please share the movie version of this song if available?   I already have the link for the original masterpiece...  Thanks in advance.❤
Christopher loyd @ 86 in 2024 wohoo
worth a watch...
2:46 LALO REFERENCE
Is this Saul when he got out of Jail finally?
Me? I'm nobody....... Lalo
Ok... you don't use steal a little girl's kitty cat bracelet... they asked for it
Next we need Jason Statham to team up with this Director.
After Saul took 7 years deal
part 2?
Don't call 911...😂😂
The end is very funny there basement in this house 😂
Bob Odenkirk gone Walter White on this one, I’ll give you that.

I hope that he enjoyed his birthday to the fullest😄
La mejor película q he visto en toda mi vida ❤

A mi en el 2000, fui con mi novia a TGI Friday.  Y nos rechazaron la entrada porque mi novia era morenita. Me dijeron que había una fiesta privada, pero era mentira. Yo ahí mismo me fui y resulta que al lado estaba tocando aljadaqui. La pasamos mucho mejor.
The Siamese cat is really a killer element.
Jessy: Who is Lalo? Bob: Nobody. 😂
If this guy showed up in "Breaking Bad",even Mike will be dead? Bad ass movie,liked it a lot!💀💀🤯🤯

Love to watch my Jimmy Mcgill forever...
This is an awesome movie! Promise.
okkkayyyyy saul
Don’t worry Professor 👨‍🏫 I have my notepad 📝
1:00 Oh Yeah
Better call an ambulance 🚨
Oh Professor Nobody … we seem to have a little bit of everybody at this House Party ❤
Christopher Lloyd looked like he really enjoyed working on this film.
I love this movie. I got satisfied watching this 'cause guess what. I'm into action movies.
This is the type of shi Lalo Salamanca would say
Anyone here after Office Ladies?
Is it just me that think that the movie has almost the same plot as John Wick ?? The same cinematic atmosphere ( Russian mafia, the main hero reveals to be a spy or assassin while seemingly livin a peaceful life...)
Based solely on the comments & general public reaction to this, I truly wonder if it contains a 'Do not try this at home' disclaimer at the end of it.
Glad two is being made

Love his daughter’s expression when the dad closes the panic room, she knows daddy is gonna waste em lol
This movie is sooo good..I’m surprised there is no part 3..& it’s theater movie..IMAX I hope
❤Nobody Humans not seeing the film in 2024_David Leitch🔥
Background  music name please
Like a wise man said or should i say wrote "EZ"
Awesome movie! Loved it!
I guess they called Saul.
This looks amazing. And if it's from Leitch, it's gotta be good.
Be careful who you messed up with.
@2:01 is that part even in the final film? I don't remember anything about his "auditor" or the black dude at all.
Bob odenkirk played this role so amazingly well. I’m glad he decided to come back after doing better call Saul
This shit gas
Fucking LOVE this movie, this is totally my life. I get ran over constantly by my employer and whomever else, I have a job that I fucking hate with a passion,  I love those im my life more than they could ever know, And to top it off.... I can be a VERY dangerous individual.   I'm not some Joe bad ass but I definitely know what I can and what I can't handle and a LOT of the bullshit that the GETS TOSSED on my plate, I can most definitely handle and I've dealt with some very dangerous people, which I guess in that sense would also make me a very dangerous person, which I absolutely hate to admit to and I am NOT proud of that whatsoever!!! This movie really resonated with me. I just wish I could do something about my life and my situation instead of sounding like I'm glorifying it because I'm not at all. I'm rather ashamed of my life! But at the same time I am,  or would be very happy to clean the streets up of ALL 'of the filth!!!
"Me? I'm nobody."  This is the exact moment that Saul Goodman became Lalo Salamanca
What sort of cop would advice a civilian to engage against a robber or something similar? It bothers me how dumb these movies are...
Great fuckinh movie
Wats the song name?
average MS Excel user:
If more straight white men behaved like this, we would sort out all the crap that modern society throws at us. Problem is, they mentally castrated us, and now we just don't care. In fact, being docile is great.
Where can I watch this ?
basic plot but executed amazingly
Breaking Bad 2
ItsAllGoodMan
*Saul Badman*    "All it takes is one bad day... "   In theatres now
This is what happens when nobody called Saul
AAWWAAWWWQQQWWAWW
It's like John wick prequel series
Only recently watched this film and loved it, and it looks like there is a Nobody 2 to come. Great cast and brilliant fight scenes. A must to watch anytime.
Cool, it has the Taken + Joker mix.  God bless.
This would be the next upgrade for Saul Goodman if anybody hurt Kim.
JOHN WICK: They killed my dog 🐕  NOBODY: They stole my watch and my daughter's kitty cat bracelet ⌚  David Leitch knows his stuff 🐐💯
I gotta say, that lasagna looked terrible.  But the movie was awesome.  Looking forward to movie 2
Hey, guys, look up what "begs the question" means before you have your characters try to look smart for saying it. Hint: It has absolutely nothing at all to do with raising a question.
I assume this is a comedy haha -- the CGI looks ass, lots of cringe lines, funny actor
anyone notice WM on the coffee mug? doesn't look like a stock crash logo now
I see jimmy has now escaped prison
saul got the gandas😂
I like to believe that this is a movie about Saul, but with another name
Superb movie...i love hatchie 😍😍🥰🥰
I hate trailers like this that basically give everything away and show you the whole movie in short. What’s the point
Yeahhh the guy that play the lawyer in some movies i forgot
Watched it, worth a watch
Where does Hutch live in this movie?
Absolute class film 100%
Just watched this movie and I really enjoyed it and I didn’t think I would. I would definitely recommend. Better than John wick and more believable as a character
WOW, What a fantastic movie just watched it, almost like a Tarantino movie, very violent & good soundtrack 👏❤️👏❤️👏❤️
I mean who is this dude is he related to John wick?? I mean why they always making these John wick type movies but this guy is not like John wick because I thought this guy was a wimp come to find out this guy got the whole world petrified of him!! What a movie nothing But action Nice plot good acting the same as John wick but like I said when John wick first come on you no John wick when nobody first come on this dude looks like a nobody but he's not 🤣🤣 He's a maniac living like a civilian This movie is definitely a 10 out of a 10 just from the action alone what a movie but I just I'm getting tired of these John wick movies let John wick have his own wave!! But I wouldn't mind a part 2 of this 🤣🤣 That's how good this movie was..
Aw, gee, I want to see the whole film but I'm not paying for it.
Keanue Reeves as legend himself deserve a GENRE all by his name.
This Is Basically If Saul Goodman If He Fully Embracing The Cartel and  replacing The Mike Ehrmantraut as their fixer and "Hutch Mansell" just Another Identity Provided By "The Dissapearer" because Cartel wants  Him Back and "Gene Takavic" Prove to Fail to evade the authorities.
This movie 😊🎉
Better call Saul !!
Какое неожиданное и крутое перевоплощение после Солу Гудмана!😊👏 Ещё и с юмором! Кайфанула от фильма, спасибо!
Im going to fk u up lol 😅 lov that line never gets old
Nobady 2 Has Confirmed By The Creators... Now Enjoy It's Trailer !!
Just done watching the movie, this is the fever child of John Wick and Home Alone.
Babayaga and nobody 😎 Cool nicknames guys,but leave someone alive ok?
Next movies we have collaboration Hollywood actor.. Title is "Nobody but john wick far from home"..😂😂
The most dangerous people are the ones happily willing to do the work without any recognition or fame.
Nice must watch
Goddamn I Never Knew Saul Goodman this Badass..
This was fun
Jimmy Mcgill if he changed his name to John Wick
Why wasn't this movie made bigger?!?
Saul John wick can't hurt me. Saul John wick:
BRO HAS CRAZY DAD LORE
LLYA NAISHULLER CALLS SAUL TO BREAK BADS
"Me? Nobody" - Lalo "Me? Uh... Im nobody" - Baul Goodkirk
I just watched this movie , DAMN ! AWESOME!!! OMG this makes REACHER , PUNISHER, TAKEN, ETC LOOK BAD. COMPETION OS ON !!
'ts all Wick-man
they repeat same movies stories over and over again
his line about having a part of him that he has kept hidden, and it is time to awaken it (or something like that) is what hooked me. I think there are a lot of people (mostly men) who have been trained to be submissive and compliant who have an angry side they would enjoy releasing on some really deserving trash.
Bad as fuckk... Reminds me of John wickk.. I could actually watch this movie twice..!
So this is Saul Good Man after doing 86yrs in prison 😅
Anybody knows the song from 1:12 ?
Sequel please 🙏
Is that mike
I was expecting a little blue cg creature to fly around his head. :D
So raw, so fun to watch
You better not call Saul
0:54, I dare you
John Wick meets Kevin McAlister 😊
They "phuked" with the kitty bracelet....  You know somebody dying now.
"That fucking nobody is John Wick..."
BCS s5e8, LALO says saul, "you are NOBODY ". In context of picking up the 7miilion to bring lalo out of jail.
I want to see Nobody II, because of the question his wife asked the realtor at the end.
I remember seeing a YT short of the old man locking the door behind him after seeing his tattoo and never knew it was this movie. Watching now and it’s awesome
Goood movie love the bus fight scene
Fucking A
NOBODY does it better
Saul darkside
Better Call Saul 😂
This movie was pretty good
חיקוי של גון וייק
I love it because they don't make him into a Jason Bourne/John Wick/Robert Macall. He goes into a punch-up outgunned and outnumbered. He's gonna take a hell of a beating, but those who outnumbered him need ICU. He's battered and bruised but walks off the injuries he's picked up, ready for another couple of thugs.
1.15 what that song called
It has some link to LEO....  Movie......
Dude went from better call Saul to better call an ambulance 😂
Just when I thought I saws the last movie with Christopher Lloyd from Taxi, 1.21 Jigga Watts! lol
This is the most chameleonic Kevin Costner role ever !
It's giving John Wick vibes
Bro think he is lalo salamanca
Ilya is a brilliant director.
Drink your milk
Lalo really changed that man lol
i came here from spider man tobey maguire meme nobody spiderman
The Daughter: they stole my kitty cat bracelet  The Dad: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️pure gold🥇🏅🏆👑⚜️that is one hell of a dad🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this was a damn good surprise .. phew .. watched is twice, back to back ..
This movie is a gem hidden in the world of identity political woke Hollywood junk.
wtffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff is thisss
Breaking bad!! Better call Saul
Journey from better call Saul to Don't call 911.
....wait until you meat Walt....
Bro thinks hes better call saul 💀
This version of Saul could have taken down the Cartel single-handed.
Nobody: one movie nobody saw in 2020.
This movie is just great action! Just go amd fucking watch it,man!
Anyone After Jailer 🔥
better call saul? more like better call a movie director so you can write an actual scenerio
Looks like he got the kitty cat back.
Sort of history of violence without Cronenberg stylishness
Бухгалтер, милый мой бухгалтер. Вот чего точно не ожидала😂😮
don't watch this trailer! Just watch the movie! This just goddamn spoiled the whole movie for me...
What a “in your face…kick ass” movie! Bob is brilliant in this role…he never smiled once…but did the “down and dirty” like a gigolo!!! What a thrill ride on a crazy train!!! A must see!!!
bro think he lalo 😭😭😭
This is the moment Saul Goodman became Saul *Badman*
1:12 tell the song name anyone
My top 3 favorite films, love how it ended…gives me hope they’ll make another one 💯🤩
“Who the Fuck are you?” “Hi I’m Saul Goodman, did you know you have rights?”
Since I fucking LOVE “Bob Odenkirk”. I will ALWAYS prefer THIS over John Wick. This movie is just want I want in an Action Movie nowadays.
If Saul Goodman was John Wick in alternate universe:
one man can beat army 💩💩💩💩💩💩
💩💩💩💩
This movie is all about an old man, who wants to prove to himself that he is better than young people in muscle. What's the point?  Clearly, it's out of sync, there may be many areas where old people are better than young (eg: looking at life or seeing the death in its eyes), but muscle and strength is not one of them.
Here after Jailer trailer 🤗
this is the most retarded movie I've ever seen. I turned it off 10 minutes before the end, I couldn't watch another minute without my head exploding from the amount of nonsense
this movie is remade(unofficial) in india and releasing as 'Jailer' all over the world on Aug 10th.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5BeWdODPqo
Good to watch just once 😂
Don’t usually like action movies but this surprised me in a good way! Definitely worth the watch and hoping that they make a sequel👌🏽
Loved Nobody! Bob is kicking in his movie!!! I watch Part 2 for sure!
Holy Shit it took me awhile to realize it's the actor who played Saul Goodman
Jailer 🔥 Rajni
Same story, different actor. Again with the russian bad guys and ex super federal agent like equalizer movies
👍👍 great movie
After jailer 😅😅😅
Why came here after Jailer Showcase😅
ooh, Louis Prima! <3
LOL
Don't call 911, better call Saul
never expected to see christopher lloyd as a badass, love it
Loved this movie.
If the son had of been seriously injured laying in a hospital bed still alive after the dad saying “let the guy go.” that would of made for a good movie. This is dumb.
I think im finally gonna watch this one tonight
This was a fantastically entertaining piece of cinema. It's a real shame it didn't take off.
2:48 thats what lalo said
Awesome Movie....Watched it on Amazon Prime
I really wish it was a Nobody in the Movie, not yet another John Wick/Equalizer Knockoff.
One of my favorite
Better call Saul
Saul after breaking bad
Wtf koolbash..where is part 2? This movie is soooooooooooooo fucking good
18/7/2023  11/20 pm  سێ شەم
Nah, Nobody Call Saul 💀
For me, easily the most hilarious part was... *SPOILER*       ...The burglars didn't even steal the bracelet. It just fell under the couch. XD
Christopher Lloyd rocks! Awesome movie!
best fck ing movie i ever wacht i just wacht him 30 secs ago hell yea i hope there will come a part 2
By now it's a genre: super-deadly-harmless-looking-secret-or-becoming-killerman-on-a-killing-spree-movie - short: DADly Revenge movies List: Death Wish 1-whatever Equalizer 1+2 John Wick 1-4 Machete 1+2 Nobody Death Sentence R.E.D. 1+2 Under Siege 1-3 Harry Brown Peppermint and some 300 more possibly :)
Nobody is the story about John wick's long lost half brother.
Better Call Nobody...
Pantera’s Vulgar Display of Power anyone?  It’s painfully obvious, right?
I like this movie more than john wick. More dialogue by the main character, better humor, good fight scene, not over complicated plot.
Dont drink and drive, but if you do - better call Saul 🎉
Absolutely loved it, and I'm a quiet 70-year-old female.  Watched it for free on freevee.
This is the exact moment Saul Goodman became Mike Ehrmantraut.
From better call Saul to better call an ambulance
Cant believe Jimmy could be this tough
I think bro just inspired from Lalo Salamanca's dialogue and made full movie 😅
I was told i have (White guilt) ? for saying i like this movie ..? Can someone tell me what (White guilt) is? and why they would say that?>thank you
"did u even take a swing at least?" -- 😂😂😂 what police ever says that?? ur NOT suppose to engage robbers in violence, esp if they have a firearm.
solid flick
Maybe one day even John Wick might end up calling Saul😅
Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet!
👏👏👏👏👏💟
They stole my kitty cat bracelet 😡
just completed john wick chapter 4, now I can imagine this two getting a collab, although there was Nobody in movie but I prefer this Nobody
“You look like shit dad” “You should see the other guys” Favorite line for me
Never Call Saul
I love how synced up the punches are with the bgm
Brother of the Babayaga?
Wow wow wow John wick which I loved is a joke compared to this one Well done guys
IT'S A FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!!!!
Kung fu soccer dad. I can dig it.
beautiful movie ,👏
- Don't call 911 - Better call Saul
No matter how many he kills, he is still innocent and he should better call Saul
I have just watched the film and I can’t understand how can this be called a trailer… shouldn’t this be a sort of teaser instead of a film summary?😅
SAUL GOODMAN
From his previous work, Bob Odenkirk seemed like such an unusual choice to play an action hero, but oh god, it seems he's friggin' brilliant at it !!! When this first popped up on Netflix, I watched it out of curiosity. A couple months later, all I could remember was the basic plot and that I'd thought it was really good, so I just watched it again........ Yep. It's still good. :D  It's refreshing to see an "Old fashioned" action film these days, where no one's trying to cram "Woken" philosophies down your throat, or trying to crow bar some agenda into the storyline.  I'm happy to see that the studio went with the classic plot of "Wronged man seeks revenge", with guns, explosions, cars, and bodies dropping like flies...... it's the sort of movie related escapism an old fashioned guy like me misses.
He nailed the role ❤ amazing actor 💪
Better Punch Saul
Lovely movie, with some killer soundtracks🔥
I remembered a scene from this trailer last night, took so long to remember the title. That is how you know its a good trailer!
Best be a couple of sequels after this unique hit ?
James Mc.Gill after season 6 of "Better call Saul" 💀
Better call Saul 😂
This movie is the definition of “They got us on the first half”
Saul Badman
I can't remember where I heard this from but the director said the difference between Nobody & John Wick is John didn't want to come back. "Nobody" wants to come back, he's itching for it.
Watched this yesterday absolutely loved it, doc brown with his shotgun lol
This is when Saul got inspired by Lalo and became Mr Nobody.
It's the era for Bob odenkirk making blockbuster movies ❤❤❤ More of bob please ❤❤❤
When Slippin' Jimmy get real serious!!!
That f*** nobody is not john wick
Bro went from better call saul to never touch hutch
It was great
Hi I'm Saul goodman did you know you have rights
saul goodman as john wick
Tamil dubbed
Saul if he never cancelled that dojo membership.
*****WATCH THE MOVIE BUT NOT THE TRAILER***** Such a great film but the trailer gives away the best twist. I watched without watching the trailer and am sooooo glad I did.
I wanna see like a fan made film where he meets saul goodman somehow. Maybe he gets into trouble and he calls saul to get him out. It would be fun to see bob play both saul and Hutch and the contrast between them.
Superb movie. I'm a girl and really prefer psychological movies but this was BEYOND SENSATIONAL. 🎉
Wow, what a masterpiece!! Really enjoyed this movie, full of action, great dialogues and perfect acting not forgetting the wonderful choice of soundtracks. A very unique movie which has similar taste to the John Wick franchise but more exciting with some family action and moments
John Wick meets Saul. It's freaking awesome!!
Now we know who John Wick's father is.
Love how random this looks
Cringe.
In my opinion both Nobody and John wick are same but Nobody is like a version of John wick if his wife didn’t die and both got older together
What a movie...!!!!!!
Just watched it . Amazing action with so many funny scenes😅
Hutch :"Does this house have er... " Wife finishing off his sentence: "A basement"  Brilliant film ...  *********
Mr Goodman ?
Great to see Jimmy bought a new identity from the vacuum guy to persue his new adventure
Better call Saul and doc brown? It was bound to be a banger.
So many breaking bad little touches: the microwave “ding”!  How the scene was shot where he leaves the ruskie night club. Same as when Walter paid his first  visit to Tuco.😂 Big destruction construction  for “felina” and overall ingenuity of the main character seemingly “under-appreciated” by his family.  Formulaic but some cool one liners hey if we get to see Bob smash the daylights out of his enemies why not😁
Saul after calling the vaccum man for the third time in a row
This is what Saul Goodman would have been had Mike not been created for that one episode where Bob was not available.
2:44. Guys, this movie is about Saul Goodman trying to be like Lalo after he bullied him.
better not call Saul
This movie is a masterpiece!! And the bus fight scene is the best fight scene I've ever seen!!!
This movie is absolute masterpiece The soundtracks is just gorgeous✨️
Absolutely fcuking batsh*t crazy, I bloody loved it.. Haven’t loved a movie like this is a very, VERY long time, 10/10
Ohhhh Saul!!! ❤
Mike Erhmantraut's effect....
It reminded me kinda of "the equalizer". Very nice!
This proved to be another senseless  US revenge film full of  gratuitous violence. It's no wonder USA has one of the most violent and unhappy societies on the Planet
I remember the 'Taken' and now Nobody. Truly class  🔥
nobody vs wick, i think nobody would win  hands down
Someone remind me why anyboy would want to watch a very passed middle aged, pretening to be middle aged, unactractive, short, going bold-ish man actor that talks with a fake forced lower gravelling tone of voice, acting quite ridicously like a badass when clearly doesn't have the physique du rôle nor the gravitass to be remotelly believable. Tell me, isn't serious, it's commedy, is it?
I particularly enjoyed the bus scene 😂👊
Arya Stark really putting in work 😅
Better call Saul
What a film! OMG I loved every piece of it!!!
I like how he gets his arse kicked but still come out on top the fight scenes are alot more realistic I mean you take on 6 guys and not receive any damage the realism just doesn't show  but in this he gets battered 😂
Jai shree ram
Wasted money in cinema for garbage john wick 4. Nobody is 100 times better.
I would definetly call this film "I am going to fuck you up"
Shame about the cliche deep/whisper voice he has, same as John wick, Jason statham etc…
Just watched it yesterday. I loved it.
Call him.SAUL.GOODMAN
alright i better call saul
Is there anyone else thinking Hutch is somehow Butch from Pulp Fiction??? Jacket! Watch!!!
There's no such thing as black Russians. This is all a part of the plan to brainwash whites into becoming extinct and sacrificing our cultures and languages to outsiders. Russians are white European majority with Asians in the outer lands. No such thing as an African Russian. Its all apart of the communist plot to destroy Europe.
That's the moment Saul become Nobody
Just another superhero movie but without a cape and lycra.  I was bored 20 mins in.  I was really bored 40 mins in after a hour I turned it off. Just another predictable pointless movie same at the other 50 like it. Nothing stood out accept how bad it was. I guess the simpletons are easily pleased but I hated it. It's just more tomato ketchup and claret on boat races.
I'm so glad I didn't watch the full trailer before I watched the movie......that twist was so so good. If you haven't seen it yet - DON'T WATCH THIS TRAILER.
Goddamn it, can we have a sequel where John Wick is in it with NOBODY?!!!
Saul gone part 2
Is it official yet...?  They are trying to merge John wick this movie..?
What happens when a man finally stands up for himself and reclaims his masculinity
it's like John Wick and John McClane in one person. 😂
I need a dust filter for a Hoover Max extract pressure pro model 60. Can you help me with that?
i hatethe trailer  they show  everything .
He is a somebody he's Saul Goodman.
I just finished watching Breaking Bad and I was like no bro....Better Call Saul on that one,   like bro, bro bro
done watching this !! love it !, I want Hutch/Nobody back story 😁
a real stupid American movie. I'm kidding you about democracy when every house has to have a gun and its own psychiatrist.😐
"theres a long dormant peace inside me that so very badly wants out" real
Saul glow up
great movie..i miss these movies genre ..1 guy vs the world ..many movies in my childhood in the 1990s were like this..and then disappeared thanks for john wick to bring them back
Just watched it. Cool movie. Reminded me a lot of Red (the movie)
This movie is soooooooooooo much better when you havent seen the trailer beforehand.
I unironically thought this was Saul
Nice film
John Wicks cousin finally
lalo? who’s lalo?
I love Bob Odenkirk, I’m so glad he’s getting more and more recognition.
1:40 I like how what he does is very similar to Lalo's course of action when armed men come into his home.
that amerika...
Looks like he learned from Lalo  "Me? I'm a Nobody"
the only part i dont get is why the bus lady let those guys in.  their looks screamed hoodlum all over.............
I’m so grateful that I watch this brilliant masterpiece!!! So mind blowing that i not regretting spending my precious times watching it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That movie is SO GOOD MAN
Does nobody have a link were w ecan watch this movie for free online?? (Pun intended xD)
That fu***** nobody was John wick.
Wt if John wick comes in next part
This is saul after he gets new life
What a stupid movie 😄 They tried to copy the russian, Denzel Washington movies....
*Somewhere in an alternate universe* You know you have rights? The constitution says you do
John Wick : Dog Nobody : Kitty Cat Bracelet
Nobody: you brought a lot of shotguns Dad: well, you brought a lot of russians  Deym dad and son duo!!!
"Better call saul " Has just finished "training day" With  Mike.
Just watched this film. It's sufficiently entertaining. I have to watch it twice.
that was a proper "VARATHAN" malayalam movie : )
This is when John Wich & Liam Neeson are in one character. What a fucking legend.
Damn this movie is fire! Hopefully theres a part 2
Waiting part 2
Fun fact : The director for this film also directed hardcore henry
This guy needs to team up with John Wick and Ethan Hunt
So this is John Wick from another universe
John WIck?
Don't call 911. Call Saul instead
Better Call Saul
Just watched it in Netflix and f*cked that was epic!, John witch ,hutch and Anna I want them all together haha.They've done better and realistically the beating stuff than john wick.
They should make a movie about the auditor and the accountant
Vikram vs nobody 😂
Awesomeness!
slippin Jimmy is back! He learned from Mike!
Howard: Who are you? Gene: Nobody
The man who would kill for a kitty cat bracelet!!!
what a comedy show this was
Nobody call saul wick 😂😂😂
Atleast it's not a Netflix movie.
if they dont somehow make a cross between wicks universe and this one we need to all march on hollywood with pitchforks and torches
Just watched it mennn reform of John wick
more neanderthal antics.  It's a no from me.  NEXT
Yo Saul Goodman playing GTA in IRL
Uauu ❤
I want part2
Padam Tamil la ellaya
One of the best movies ever
1:33  "Don't call 911... Better call Saul"
SAULLL?????
incriveeeeeeeel!!!
When your wife say her husband is Nobody
-Who? The fucking nobody? -that fucking nobody it's nobody.
It's better call Saul
“What is happening?” “Dont call 911.. Better call saul!”
I just realized the actor for this movie played as Saul Goodman
Glad to see Jimmy McGill finally broke bad.
Saul Goodman From being a lawyer to blue empire and now to John wick
It's not John Wick It's All Good, Man
But did he get the kitty cat bracelet?
When Saul Goodman becomes Mike Ehrmentraut.
Absolutely brilliant Movie.
I saw the movie no spoilers by the way but my opinion it was f****** badass
I don’t know how you can’t just enjoy the hell out of this movie. Quick and easy and doesn’t take itself overly serious.
Bro turning in to lalo 💀
Don't call 911.  You better call saul instead.
Don't call 911 ...you better call Saul
Saul stole the last line "Me? I'm Nobody." from Lalo, crazy character development.
Nobody is quite like Jimmy McGill, loves the thrill.
Do not fuck with nobody loser it’s actually medieval 🐻👩🏼‍🦳👧🏿🫠
A new John Wick in town! But better!!!👍😊😊
Saul Wickman
Glorious!
:) Ale z nimi poszedł w tym autobusie, mistrzostwo świata
I just love it. We need that trio everywhere. In every country from Europe. Yes we do!! 😂😂😂🤣
Doc Brown and Saul Goodman killing a bunch of the people is the greatest shit I've ever seen
is this on netflix?
Great film with Bob Odenkirk  from "Better Call Saul" and he plays the role of Hutch Mansell exceptionly well. The trailer is just one of many great scenes where humor and violence collide.
This is every man's parallel thought when he asks you kind to be respectful.
So who’s Lalo? Who? Lalo? You thought some dude named Lalo sent us. You seemed pretty freaked out. Never heard no Lalo on the street  It’s Nobody
Better call Saul guys
To me this is what happened to saul after Breaking Bad, and it's called nobody makes it even better
Most underrated movie of 2022
We need part 2 😭
Lokesh sutta vada idhu dhana 🥯🤣
Agent Vikram 🤣🤣🎉🎉
Didn't know Jimmy had that dawg in him...
Oh my god, THIS IS THE BEST !!!!!!
Hey soul good man
Jimmy Mcgill 🗿
Damn season 7 of bcs looks insane     Prison really got the worst of Saul! He’s a changed man!
Man! The salamacas would fear you 👍Lalo s proud of you ...in heaven ...
This is the moment Saul became hutch
0:59 this fucking amazing
This was so awesome. Bob Odenkirk  a dry effective fallible hero that you can't help but like and action script faultless
dam saul got tired of being a lawyer so he took a page from mikes book and became a mercenary
What is that music @ 1:13 ? Love it 😍
“Who the fuck are you?”  “I’m Saul, Saul Goodman”
I never heard of this show? Where can I watch it??
JOHN WICK in MULTIVERSE. :)
Waiting for part two! Im nobody
Great movie! 10/10 visual and cinematography are great. plot is awesome
Saul really broke bad
Nobody 2 starts filming this year from Universal!
Looks like finally a movie i want to watch
😎😉
Wtf is with the ghetto garbage (c)rap.    You don't even know what he's saying!   AABEDOBADAYBAYODMABAYDA.    What kind of sht is that?
This is literally Saul Goodman in Mike's clothing..
This is how You should treat russian terrosits. In this movie showed how russian animals behave in real life.
"Me? I'm nobody." YOU STOLE THAT LINE FROM LALO!
What’s the song in this trailer called?
Wow. I mean if he gets caught, I think he can represent himself in court
i though hes a cashier now . yu liar saul
better call 911
Fun Fact: John Wick and Nobody are both in the same universe, meaning they probably know each other.
"Don't call 911... Call Saul!"
THIS is how you do a trailer!
really good movie compared to the usual garbage hollywood produces
this movie is 3 hours of absolute chaos. A 100% must watch film.😎. I love that grandpa.
He said lalos line
Better Call Saul
Who pissed off this lawyer??
john wick killed people because they killed his dog nobody killed people just because he thought that his daughters kitty cat braselet was stolen
Bro went from 🤓 to 🗿
Christopher Lloyd was hysterical in this movie. He looked like he was having a great time!
You know this is good when the 3rd most popular breaking bad character and the producer for John wick make a movie out of this
why the hell is everyone calling saul in the comments?
“I may have over corrected”😂 In some respect this is even better than John Wick.
ok I gotta watch this :)
Good movie outside of the diversity hire rza.
Saul Wick
MIDDDDDDDDDDD
This is a GREAT movie.  I've watched the bus scene a dozen times, NEVER get's old!
man, this is shut em up 2
Hutch and Wick can end man kinds in one night 😂
formal slippin' Jimmy.
deserves an Emmy
Is this movie for real, loved this falla in breaking bad and better call saul  but my god this movie is absolutely shite!!!!!
Nah bro why they punchin saul on the thumbnail he litteraly lives to bail us outta prison dawg 💀
wow what a great project cant wait to see it
when i am bored i just like to see this movie its just a family guy version of john wick
What a great movie
DAMN I MISS THIS FILM, THIS IS THE BEST ACTION FILM I EVER SEEN. WE NEED NOBODY part ll
he better call saul
I'll watch it just for Saul Goodman. No shame
"Don't call 911" Call saul! Saul Goodman. A lawyer you can trust!
this is the non-superhero version of daredevil/matt murdock.
BETTER CALL SAUL.......DONT CALL 911
Bob is awesome.. but this is a bit cringe.
After doing the long haul with Bob as Saul Goodman,  the movie Nobody is literally a trailer by the time you've finished the 93 minute movie you'll have felt it was 15 minutes.  It's an all in one explosive master piece.
Sooooooo good
Great show. And you can CRAM that other woke nonsense where the sun don’t shine thank you. This is what the silent majority want. More please.
saul goodman ain't tripping <3
I am an auditor
I like to imagine this is the sequel to Better Call Saul
One of the best movies I’ve ever seen
This is the exact momen Saul Goodman became nobody
Just watched this and LOVED IT
🔥🔥🔥
Marvelous fantastic beasts movie wating - 2 same family same actor unlimited 👌👌👌👌👌👌 goosebumps movie
Trash movie I almost fell asleep
Bob Odenkirk is looking like Bruce Willis in this movie.
I ran over John Wick's dog and now he's out for my blood! I BETTER CALL SAUL!
1:33 i legit thought he would say "better call saul" ngl
What a godawful film. If you like some guy smashing a bunch of faces for fun, then you're sure to like this film. I got fooled by the good reviews and the fact that the start is really good. Then it descends into crap very very quickly. It's beyond dumb.
Is "Wicksploitation" a word?
this should have been Liam Neeson
saul badman
Part two please!!!!!
donde la puedo ver gratis
A cross between “Shoot em up” and “John Wick”. Great movie
This is what would've happened if Jimmy stayed with only 7 years.
Better call 911
I'm nobody... Someone read the Odyssey
Alternate universe: Lalo is shitting his pants thinking of Saul.
Alternate universe: Lalo is shitting in his pants thinking of Saul.
I saw this trailer today and all of a sudden, the YouTube algorithm makes sense again!
John wick cinematic universe
finally there is a movie without sexual scenes and kisses 🥹
Watched this at my sister's partner's place last night for his birthday and damn, this movie was so awesome and so funny. Would watch it again.
This is what happens when Saul escapes from prison
Where can i watch this, its not on any streaming service!!!
meow
Hutch: Hey, hey!
That fucking Nobody, is John Wick
bob odenkirk is so fine
1 hour and 32 minutes of this movie is already had enough talent. Well played, David Leitch.
0:40 i thought it was mike
What a music 1:11 ?
guys tell me genuinely plz , is it worth watching??
Saw this movie today and boy it was fantastic!! Absolutely awesome!!  One of the best films I’ve ever seen!!
I think he'd better call saul
Damn! The new Kevin Costner "Bodyguard" sequel looks cool
John wick revenge for his dog and car this dude track down the bad guys for a f*ckin kitty cat bracelet what a legend 😂
One of the best movies of last year, in my opinion.
Please, Please, PLEASE! We need a (good) sequel! Bob Odenkirk is the everyman action hero we need!
One of the best movies I never heard of! Thank God for YouTube shorts! This movie has one of the best action scenes near the end of any movie! Unmatched! Anyone who hasn’t seen this, GO SEE IT!
Why in the actual fuck have I never heard of this movie!?!? I actually don't live under a rock!!
God Ilya makes so amazing movies
Don't call 911,  Better call Saul !
Was a good movie but I got some criticisms: 1).
We need a movie just like this for Mike from B&B
I never would have thought Bob Odinkirk could play such a badaas. His performance has blown away every badaas i've seen for the last 30 yrs. Who knew he had it I'm him.
Jesus, what a terrible movie. Legends like Bob shouldn't take any jobs after doing the role of their lifetime. Came here for the jimmy memes and I'm honestly astonished to see people recommending this non-ironically cheesy pile of clichés.
I've scroll pass this movie couple of times so I decide to give it a look..ohhh boy it was worth it !!
I know a guy, who knows a guy called SAUL GOODMAN😉
Great movie
Pure artistic
The moment gene takovic became Hutch Mansell
0:39 I just thought that was Mike for a second
you should Better Call Saul when you this man!
Awesome trailer :]
this movie is incredible
https://youtu.be/OgvCF9mj1ms
Just watched it on HBO, loved it! Action scenes were great. I know everyone will compare these type of movies to John Wick. But this is definitely a gem on its own
I was so on board with this movie until 2:03 min in...... omg I don't care about British people, fucking missions, fucking noble deeds, get that unrealistic accent out of here trying to shoe horn in some bulshit plot or call to action. Christ almighty. Just make a movie about fucking people up no one gives a shit. And don't write jokes either, let them write themselves. Kitty cat bracelet. Gimme a break
This is a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy the ride, no complicated bs, simple plot and loaded action
GREAT movie and I just saw it last night. Can't wait to see the sequel.
1:33 "Don't call 911... Better Call Saul."
He should call saul
Oh no i better caul saul
I liked this movie a lot. Can’t get enough of Saul! I hope they make a sequel to it telling the backstory and a lot about his wife… I think she’s a lot more than they showed in the movie.
Michael.Fuckin.Ironside.  Splinter Cell is my favorite game serries. Listening to him talk takes me back to all those games and hours spent enjoying every single piece of them. They couldn't have chosen a better voice actor for Sam. He really gave that character something memorable.
NICE mov. lol lol lol👍
saul
That old man actor from Back to the Future is truly a surprise cameo
Mr Goodman???
Have some more chicken, have some more pie, it doesn’t matter if it’s boiled or fried
Better call an ambulance!
Hey y'all, it's Better Call Saul!
Hi I'm Saul Goodman, did you know that you have rights?
Watched this last night feckin awesome.
Incredible video!
Awesome video!
Made my day!
Wish I would have seen this earlier.
Can you make more videos please
Love it
Enjoyed it!
Great video
So good
When will the next video drop?
Bliss!
:)
That F***ing nobody… was Saul Goodman 😂
Nobody called saul
Hutch Mansell - 'Don't call 911, YOU BETTER CALL SAUL'
Better call saul traumatized me so much with all the bald people that when i saw the old guy i really thought it was mike erhmantraut  😭
Alternate timeline, where Saul instead lives under the alias of Hutch Mansell.
What an entertaining movie! please don't destroy this movie by making a sequel and leave this movie as it is
Kevin Costner
he’s saul goodman
Just watched without seeing the trailer. Only watched this now.   The movie was great, I haven't really enjoyed action movies lately,  but I really enjoyed this one. The trailer could have left some mystery, but once again the trailer revealed everything that's going to happen in the movie.. Why?
I'm the most underrated comment on youtube.
Better Call Saul Epilogue
Nobody part 2.  Hope it's coming
Nobody 2 one up and tha movie construction
A short movie 1.5hrs. But man the actions scenes were wholesome. Many compared with John wick and that's a natural thing but yeah seeing the budget it wasn't a disappointment at all. Love to see the sequel soon .  -nobody
Be aware of stealing a kitty kate bracelatt or killing a dog🤣
The fact Bob went from purely comedic roles to this stuff makes me laugh
Trailer answer-Who are you? Me...I’m nobody  Realistic answer- Who are you??? Me...I’m bootleg John Wick
Song at 1.13?
I just saw this movie and I absolutely loved it
Of course its alot like John Wick, but it has alot of its own qualities that make it it's own movie. The main antagonist isn't all alone, he has a family, he has a job. And lets not forget about Christopher Lloyd.  A+. 10/10
2022 anyone?
Better Call 911
I absolutely adore the fight scenes in this movie. Just enough to make it realistic and fun at the same time.
That's a trailer that should have stopped at, "It's been a hard day."  It would have teased without showing the whole movie.  Studios need to show us a little more respect for "getting it"
this is the dumbest movie I ever watched. They tried to make it as JhonWick , in which they miserably failed. All the reasons for the fights were like really dumb. I know we shouldnt give much place for logic in movies such as this. Still my brain was really upset the whole 1.5 hours of the movie.
John Wick is badass Hutch got more badass but it's in the dream
So glad I didn't watch this trailer before watching the movie itself. Spoils everything.
2:43 Lalo, look what you did to Saul
Did you know you have Rights? The construction does, but I don't....
If this version of Saul was in better Call Saul, it probably ended in just one episode
Thanks for the short version of the film, now nobody (ba-dom-dish) need to see the long version.
Dude better call saul now cuz he is no lawyer, but now a hitman!
How did i not know about this when it was in theaters?
So movie is basically about me in every singlel rpg i play making worst possible descisions
This come from the outburst from beeing "Saul Goodman"
The perfect timing of song "the impossible dream"
Lalo Salamanca also said he’s a nobody.
That looks absolutely fantastic
It’s like John Wick but instead of everyone trying to kill him everyone’s trying to call him
Will still piss his pants when lalo show up
Breaking bad - The movie
John Wick: Family Version.
Never Underestimate A Lawyer
Nobody. - Nobody should bother wasting time watching it. Surprised at Connie Nielsen being involved in such nonsense.
bob odenkirk!
Bob Odenkirk just got on my list with favourite actors and it was damn good to see Christopher Lloyd on action. Made my blood boil. Damn good movie,from years i didn't saw such a good movie. We need more movies like this one 🤘🤘🤘
So John wick if he had a family
Oh wow, a whole movie all about me, thanks Universal!
Better than John wick movies
That's the Nobody that I am rooting for ! Love that movie
This is what happens when you don't call saul
Relatives of john wick, transporter and equalizer
Want to see this movie baddddd!!!!!!!
Moral of the Story : Don't ever try to stole cute Babies "Kitty Kat Bracelet". Period.
He knows a Guy, Who knows a Guy ...who knows another Guy
2099 :- Jhon wick with alive family
They should make a movie with all of the bcs and bb actors actresses. Not a movie about bc or bcs but a totally different movie but use the same actors/actresses. That would be so fun and so confusing to the fans.
It was awesomely great worry watching
And nobody becomes somebody at the end haha
This is the moment then Saul became a nobody
#Can anybody tell me the song name in 1:12
It's time......time to call Saul
The background music in the trailer does it for me lol
This movie is a knockoff john wick movie
Waste of time
Watching trailer after watching movie.
Hell yeah. this movie get Escalated over the time
first a Dog and Now A Cat bracelet.... Is Next A lego Toy! 😝🤓
Music name please
damn this new season of better call saul is getting good
A cocktail of John Wick and Equalizer Really enjoyed this movie, full of action, great dialogues and perfect acting not forgetting the wonderful choice of soundtracks.
I wouldn't have set that money on fire id have taken off with it 💯
1:34  "Don't call 911.. Better call Saul!"
This might be some of Saul's dreams..after a day in court
The After Effect of Breaking Bad to Saul! :) Too much meth
Saul is OP damn
“I'm nobody I'm a tramp, a bum, a hobo I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine And a straight razor ...if you get too close to me” xD
0:28 wexler mcgill from better call saul?
I thik its movie copied from john wick🤣🤣
is this connected to BSC or BB?
Breaking bad made me fall in love with saul goodman Then better call saul made me fall in love with bob odenkirk
You are not a real action star, Jimmy! You can't change, you'll never change!  - Chuck
This film was BRILLIANT! Sorry but I was not familiar w the main character, I just thought he was hot n wow can he fight! But that is this movie! It is HOT n full of great fights! All the characters r amazing from the nut job Russian so cute singing n dancing 2 his sweet little girl, loved her orange peel teeth! Super cool, super sexy because it's not the traditional muscle bound smart ass tough guy, n super fun! All avenues of greatness ran in2 each other n created 'NOBODY!' Also, I'll have a black Russian!
"don't call 911, instead call saul"
Na I wanna know if he got the kitty cat praclet
How come I'm not watching yet this movie?
Watched it cos of Bob Odenkirk & the movie is so badass.
Hutch's dad is the most bada$$ grandpa I've ever seen. Amazing movie!! Also gives a little John Wick vibes.
Man it would be sick to see this cross-over into the John Wick universe, or even a Cameo in the next John Wick 😍
Him and john w. would be a good team
You better not call Saul. Call the coroner’s office.
Saul goodman, criminal lawer
Good film , very John Wick 😎.
This is what FBI Agent should be, quiet but deadly.
Oohh, he wasn't a nobody, nice
He looks soo sexy in this movie 🥰😍
This movie is something else
John Wick, The Equalizer, Saul and now? This guy who refers to himself as Nobody.
Bullies and gangster man , we've got another john wick.
1:33 Call Saul instead
a badass
"Nobody" does it better than Saul, "better call Saul" for this movie
This gad damn movie is so good like johnwick though 🙂🙂 is this have another part 2 movie.
M
Really nice
Imdb 9.9 in the category "nonsense" .. a la americaine !..
"and that's why i fight for you albuquerque!"
Gus would be proud today
Now you don't mess with a dog and a kitty
I am just a Saul whose  intentions are good
Omg I'm so happy I didn't watch the trailer 🤗 I was so shocked at how awesome this movie was. I wanted to watch it because of better call Saul and I'm so happy I did. It gave me John Wick with some comedy. I really hope theirs a part 2 or maybe not. Sometimes 1 is enough. I was not a fan of John Wick 2, I did enjoy 1 and 3.
Bob Odenkirk as an action man... HOW FUN!!!!!
But it looks (only) like young Joe Biden..Am i wrong?
John Wick brother or cousin?Maybe father..?
Ain't that Saul goodman
😢 Beautiful. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is the reason why I hate to these kind of Actors get old..eg Liam Neeson..Bruce Willis etc 🤷‍♀️because these are the kind of movies I'd get excited of popping some popcorns for
saul goodman
Best thing is that he takes all the hits 👍🏻
John Wick's lawyer!
Movie is... meh
Did anyone noticed how Lalo Salamanca imitates him Me ? Im nobody  Just came to talk to my lawyers
This would never happen if they never stole the kitty cat bracelet
Better call Saul then nobody
Saul Goodman becomes Heisenberg. I mean he’s also going against a drug lord 😂
This is the definition of taking what usually would be a forgettable junk food movie and doing it right
I hope there will be a sequel
I just bought this film and I'm really glad I did. 8.75 out of 10, should have been longer.
NOBODY TOLD HIM TO PUT OUT THE BINS THE NIGHT BEFORE.
It’s just make sense that they got the producer of John Wick to produce this movie
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining. It obviously had a lot of the John Wick elements (which I also enjoyed watching). But it’s nice to watch a Hollywood movie without the woke BS and just be entertained.
:)
kind of like an old one falling down.
At 0:28 finally he works with Kim again, Wexler McGill.
I’m Saul Goodman. Did you know you have rights? The Constitution says you do.
The fact that i realized that i had watched this first before braking bad/ BCS. But now i know that he ain't "Nobody"
Holy shit I slept on this movie
Long way from Saul Goodman.
Really? I like Saul Goodman but this looks kind of lame. Father was a secret agent special forces whatever trained killer and nobody knew until they messed with his family and all hell breaks loose and guns and bombs and chase scenes and blah blah blah. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I don't think it was that good. I loved the bus scene and I thought that the movie was going to follow that "realistic" where even the main character takes hits but at the end it was other action movie, entertaining tho
It was really nice, something beyond intresting, hopefully waiting for 2 one, at the ending seemed like the 3 will come 👌🏻😎
"If you liked Home-Alone, you'll Love "Nobody"
Remember, *all this bloodshed was caused by his daughter kitty cat bracelet being lost.*
He's dad is fucking badass 😎
This movie is highly underrated
Don't call 911 wow
i just saw it. it was a really fun action movie.
This movie basically saved Bob’s life 😧
Bangla dubbing of this movie is always available now, I am watching Bangla dubbing of "Nobody" movie🙂
Can’t take this seriously with Saul Goodman in it.
I fucking love this movie
Basically Home Alone but R-Rated
bunnn filmulll  10 of 10  !!!!
Twist - John wick with his dad !
Awesome movie.bob 👍 loved seeing christopher lloyd again .
I'll just pretend this is the universe of breaking bad. After when Saul changes his identity again😂 who's up for that?😅

What’s the song 1:12 and 2:09
Niko bellic from GTA 4
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!" Its like John Wick and Taken combined.  I cant imagine what this guy would do it they took his daughter.
"...trying to keep the damage to a minimum." Proceeds to collapse an entire Russian mafia
If this isn't on a platform I don't already pay for, then fuck. Guess I won't be watching.
This is why you call Saul.
I gotta see this
Best film of 2021.
John Wick my ass.
The minor ground unexpectedly talk because skate biophysically wrap into a fortunate leg. sturdy, useful nigeria
Good
Watched this a couple of weeks ago, then again when it repeated a few weeks later. And, I'll be watching it again when it's on again.
this movie was sooo good!!!
100%  One of the best.
Fantastic action movie. Much funnier than I expected as well.
This is what happens when you don’t call saul
Take out the crap Netflix and Disney are pushing and you end up with a great movie.
The ending fight scene was like the adult version of the  home alone movies.
saul when you dont call him
Why does he look, sound and move like Rorschach? I love it.
Artillery Arthur got issues man .......smh
This was a really good movie.
Best 90 minutes of my life
This movie was awesome
This looks badass
lovely stimuli for those who have his age, let's keep the society/economy thriving
badass movie, worth the watch, very entertaining, not too much of a "chick-flick" feel either. its family driven, but still badass, 10/10
1:09 You N'wah!
Fucking Beautiful!
I am 48 so I wanna see older protagonists. I don't like to see 20 year old action stars. An action star should be at least 40.
Just watched this, I have to admit this was the best movie I have watched this year! 😎
Sick movie
Saul Goodman’s Sequel
John Wick's Dog, Kittykat bracelet.....  I got the message. Don't F*** with pets.
Good old testosterone driven masculine action with no woke sjw garbage, I love this film
Do to pay for this movie but it's something to kill time with
What a brilliant film, such fun to watch. No nudity no poofery stuff, proper clean family movie.
Admittedly I am basing this on only having seen the trailer ( I definitely WILL watch the movie) but it doesn't surprise me that this is from the 'makers of John Wick' .  This is John Wick. A guy tries to live a normal life, some thing bad happens to a beloved pet, he comes out of hiding to avenge, he owes a debt to some bad dudes, he is lethal beyond belief etc. etc. etc. Is it just me or did they recycle John Wick the original ?
"give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet!!" Lmfaoo
Saul Goodman is a damn killer
John Wick REMAKE ? :DDDDDDDDD
Jimmy had a rough time going in hiding after he became Saul Goodman
🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
Hi im saul goodman, do you now i have guns?
Don't call 912 Better call Saul
Kevin Costner is a badass in this movie!
lawyer by day, vigilante at night. you know who to call?
hindi dub plz
bruh what is this song i honestly wanna listen to it, thats how good this trailer AND movie is
We finally got ss6 of better call Saul
WORST MOVIE EVER, DONT WATCH
This is gunna go down un history ill have to watch it if i have any chance of keeping up with movies just all the famous movies were before 2015 legit except batman rises
Better not call saul
Unfortunately, this movie is pretty bad. Bob Odenkirk’s performance is great, the premise of the story is good, but the plot is all over the place. I know this is a popcorn action movie, but even that kind of movies requires some level of emotional investment in the main characters. Terrible writing ruined everything for me.
I liked this better than john wick
Worst movie I’ve seen in my life, its a shame to use bob for this, hope he will remedy it in last bcs season.
Damn these 3 Ukrainians badass.
So happy to see saul goodman being an action star lol
What bgm was that inbetween the fight?
This movie's made in Winnipeg
reminds me of the one netflix anime
Just watched. Great!!Looking forward to a series. Christopher Lloyd was a bonus. Plus great playlist
It's just fun. Loved it!
WHAT IS TUNE SONG IN BUS FIGHT SCENE ?
Waiting for part 2🔥🔥💪
Just watched it, can recommend 100%. It's not just action packet, it has some good humor in it too. Don't expect a great plot, it's a straight forward movie, as simple as it gets, a quiet guy gets angry and turns into the same badass beast he supposedly was before retirement. It's really good though, I can't stretch it enough, go watch it!
Just watched this, classic action movie with a good deal of heart and humour. Awesome watch, even the Mrs enjoyed it 😆
Really entertaining, love it.  I am pretty sure they got inspired by this line from John Wick  "It's a fucking NOBODY" "That fucking NOBODY is John Wick"  Now now, in this Movie that fucking NOBODY is Mansell.
FUCK.. That movie was dame good. just watched and just feels good.
Saul is ANGRYYY! Oo
Chris lloyd moments were the funniest! great film
Amazing movie Waiting for part 2 Watched... 14 mar 2022 3:25am
Boom 💥💣‼️
Arthur Morgan: revenge is a fools game  John Wick and Hutch Mansell: I beg to differ
😲😲😲👍👍👍👍
This is like The Sleepover in Netflix as an R rated movie
what the hell.. i did not know about this movie...looks cool
This trailer is Mario 2 to Taken
Is this some kinda remake of `A history of violence` ??
*FULLY ENJOYED WITH  SHOUTING, ROARING* 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😘😘😘 *-BADASS FAMILY MAN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE-* 🔥🔥😎😎 THESE SCENES ARE LITERALLY TOP NOTCH:  *THAT FIGHTING SCENES IN BUS*  *WHEN HUTCH'S DAD KILLED A MAN THROUGH HIS SHOT GUN* , *LITERALLY I AM WHISTLING MYSELF & SHOUTING*  🔥🔥 *LAST BUT NOT THE LIST THE  KILLER SCENE IS  HUTCH'S WAITING FOR THE POLICE*  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 *ENJOYED 10000000000000000000%* 😍😍😘😘🔥🔥🔥🔥
*WHO THE FU**#K** ARE YOU??*  *I AM NOBODY*  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
one of the bestest movie i watch in my whole life❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
সুপাব মুভি
Vigilante / Rambo role for Bob Odenkirk? for Saul? A dumb action movie for an actor of this caliber? Hollywood does not really understand anything about people. Why not go ahead and cast Morgan Freeman as a Ku Klux Klan leader? Would make as much sense as this garbage.
Never been thrilled again until I watched this great movie!🙌
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!!! Same thing I do when a thief steals a Barbie doll.
When does part 2 come out?
Why the hell does the trailer spoils the whole film, literally..
Awesome movie, enjoyed every minute
FUCKED UP MAXXX!!!
This was a big disappointment— had a lot of potential but it was literally just John Wick
jadi mirip2  jhonwick
pelemnya bagus ...suka
keren ..seru
Just watched it and holy shit it was awesome, who is this guy? I almost like him more than Liam Neeson.
Saul Goodman in another dimension
It was a really good movie, It’s like John Wick except it’s not.
Lalo Salamanca to Saul: “You are nobody, no one will notice you”  (Better Call Saul S5E08:  Bagman @5:40)
I never knew Bob Odenkirk can do action movies and it's awesome. I like how he plays the character unassumingly and quietly dangerous.
Just watched the movie and it is now my new favorite.
im wayching this trailer exactly a year later after it came out, gotta watch this!
BUT I THINK NOW I HAVE TO CHANGE MY SELF INTO A MONSTER @@
EVERYBODY IGNORES ME EVEN MY ALL FAMILY
SAME STORY LIKE MY LIFESTORY
this ain't saul
This movie is fucking horrible cheesy , unrealistic fake ass die hard . Over this any day .
The beginning was nice, but in the end it went John Wick ridiculous. Not a bad movie, just a bit over the top.
CMON JUST WOW
Awesome!
Terrific movie
💋💚💓💗
Love Bob to bits, so glad he pulled through. Can't wait for the latest better call Saul ❤️ Legend, and an absolutely incredible actor.
Love this, I'm a simple guy who enjoys Vigilante films.
I hope they make part 2 of this cause it was a fcking great movie🤘.  No sex, only actions and killing with gore
this is the momemtn saul becme hiesenebeger
dont call saul pls dont do it
10/10 movie Bob Odenkirk was amazing.
What if John Wick's wife did not die? Ans:-
Music ?
Just finished the movie, this whole movie was incredible, John Wick and Hutch Mansell all the way
So this is what he does in his off time being a lawyer and laundering Walts money 💰
50% John Wick 50% The equalizer = nobody
Give me the God Damn kitty kat bracelet 🤣my favorite part!
so this NOBODY is the father of THE MAN from NOWHERE
He seems bad-ass. He could be a lawyer or something
John Wick alternate
Sorry guys but Bob Odenkirk blows Keanu Reeves all the way in this kind of movie same way Christian Bale was superior to Ben Affleck in Batman. You know why? Because you can see and feel the emotion in his face, soul, body and mind 👌♥️😊
I just watched this and daaaaamn that was an amazing movie, great performance by Bob Odenkirk, I expected it from Saul Goodman
Can anyone recommend me more movies like this and John wick where a nobody or just a normal someone is hella badass and the enemy’s messed with the wrong person
The one who holds his temper longer goes down with a bigger BOOM
Better than Avengers.... A real hard core actions with some smoky dialogue delivery.🔥🔥🔥
I am 42 minutes into the movie on HBO.  So far the movie is GREAT 👍  Thinking about getting my own 7-2 tat.  For in my day I had a similar speech to hope you like hospital food. Something I'm not proud of. I hurt a lot of people and it took me a long time to get over the pain I caused. My nickname is Bubble.   7-2 Corinthians Means Happiness.  But when that bubble burst. The happiness Is too late.
goodman
Don't watch the trailer. Just dig into the movie. You won't regret it.
What a giant pile of crap.  Only worse move is the expendables. Keep kissing Odenkirks ass everyone. Payback with mel gisbon destroys this movie.
Better call Saul ;-)
What I love about this movie.is he never gave up on his wife.
Such a shame that the trailer doesn't stop after the bus fight ...  You're fucking spoiling the movie.
I would love to see if John wick and nobody exist in the same universe....maybe they fight each other and then fight together to defeat some mafia or something ....
This movie is a masterpiece loved it
I was surprised how supportive everyone was for this movie.
as soon as I saw that fight scene, I knew that the same people who made John Wick made this movie.
Bob Odenkirk is great!
Fuck. Saul goodman is a badass too
Just saw this and have the perfect sequel Nobody 2 The Accountant 2 and John Wick 5 Guaranteed Box Office to Blow Up💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎤
This has to be the best kept secret movie. Utterly brilliant. His dad is just.epic. and the song at the end. Just wow. 💪🏻👍🏻🤣
Lol 😆 we watched the movie and we enjoyed it
Der Film is mega
great
This movie is brilliant for anyone who hasn't seen it yet WATCH IT
This movie sucked lol
Damn this rated R movie is f*cking great 💪
One of the BEST movies!!!!
Damn good movie

I guess Liam Neeson was unavailable. However, this movie was fantastic
Nobody, somebody, everybody... LoL
So this is what happened after saul changed his identity
the true mr Max Payne
26 feb ,my birthday
I hope that Nobody and John Wick will be brothers in next movie. 🙏🏻
Hindi release date oddity platform
It's even better when he told his wife to not call 911. EPIC!!
Same thing happened when politicians got on my bus
10/10 👍🏼
Well smees like he already took the classes from Walter in breaking bad and here we are beacome a fucking jhonwick
I just finished this movie now! Without watching the trailer. Its fucking good!!!!! I love it! Wish there’s part 2!!!!!!!
loved this.  Extra layer of meta in that everything we've seen of Bob Odenkirk recently is in several seasons of Better Caul Saul where in present day his character is desperately trying to be a nobody in Omaha Nebraska, just with a different set of skills.
Why wasn’t I aware of this in 2021
So this is what Saul Goodman meant when he said "I'll handle it myself"
How is ‘give me the god damn kitty-cat bracelet’ not a meme yet???
I love how The Barber’s explanation about the Russians coming after him over a debt he didn’t pay was completely made up for the trailer and not at all part of the plot
Not a bad film at all. Worth a watch.
The beginning home invasion scene is what I expect every beta male liberal in California to do
Worst film I ever saw. Get a life.
Love this movie. Just watched it. 🖤🖤🖤
I like the part when he says “ Dont call 911” .
Concidering muvies today are shit this is 8/10 john wick is shit compered to this
Been looking for a movie like this for a while. Bad ass fun action movie
Now Hutch and Wick need a movie together
Moral of the story:  if your marriage is suffering and you're not getting sex from your wife, its because youre an unassuming, unassertive, boring man and she is the one wearing the trousers. Solution: become a bad-ass killer! instant sex appeal and reinvigorated marriage!
👍🏿
LOVED this film ! A real thrill ride. Talk about justice !!!!!👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐
If you want to kill Russians, you Better Call Saul 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The old man scene was perfect.
Hollywood needs more of this… to wash the toxic femininity away.
Can’t FUCKING wait!!!!
I love Bob Odenkirk, but this movie was alright to me. It’s the same writer for John Wick so a lot of similarities, but without the coolness & fighting skills of Keanu. Overall It’s like Saul Goodman trying to be Heisenberg…I couldn’t take it serious.
Ngl getting max payne vibes
Corny but enjoyable film
This movie is basically a half-ass ripoff of The Equalizer with a much less convincing main character, but it's still pretty damn entertaining.
I remember first seeing this trailer then in the comments people were already asking for a Nobody and John Wick crossover.
I was impressed by the Russians being actual Russians (well, most of them). Great movie overall! Also, "Home alone" vibe was great.
This movie was basically just John Wick but less entertaining, it was also written by the guy who wrote John Wick, looks like somebody ran out of creative juice early in his career.
It’s time to leave the area when a nobody says ‘ give me the kitty cat bracelet’.
This is a dangerous man !! #deadly #assasin 😍🥷🏽 #nobody #SOMEBODY 👊😤 #myhero #superdad ❤ Even #Grandpa ho 😤💯💐💐👍👍🔥🔥🔥
Extremely good film
My only complaint about this movie is that at the some point he didn’t throw a lawyer card out at one of the guys @$$ he beat and say “Better Call Saul” 😂 otherwise this was awesome!  Also the sequels should be called: Nobody Too Look who’s still Nobody
What started as some serious fun but slowly down from the middle till end fight was abosolute shit I puke myself I hate these kinda fake shit action one man army movie..
after all that fighting he had better call saul for help....
I can proudly say that this is the bestest action movie I've ever seen in years love the actors and the plot ❤️❤️❤️
Watch on HBO max 2022
Saw this yesterday on Netflix: typical action movie.
Just saw this last night. IT'S FREAKING AWESOME!
Best movie
Why its not in Hindi language
Meh... after watching Odenkirk on breaking bad, and better call saul. It’s really hard to see him be a tough guy. He has been nothing more than a spineless weasel in most if not all of his roles. I don’t see him ever losing that reputation
Ray Epps?
I'm gonna f**k you up! ...wahahaha! ....and he did!
This movie was brilliant is it any good what's it about
This movie was fire 🔥
The worst, the most ridiculous  movie I have seen for a long time. A total waste of time. A disgrace of a movie.
“That fking nobody, is nobody”
Pitchowina
A seriously great movie.  Probably movie of last year, even if I only watched a few.  All gratis as well.
Wow 👌 👏  Gonna definitely watch it 😱😱😱
This movie is so underrated..
This a man a Family Man... what is wrong with this kind of relations and muscularity?
the hand grenade scene in the trailer was replaced in the movie by an improvised nail bomb which even makes the movie more badass!
So Wick meets Equaliser.  Got it.
Maybe this is the beginning of the era where they stop shitting on straight white men in so many tv shows and movies....
Looks better than 355
The bus scene is so badass, isn't possible in real life but imagining that if it was possible to put some wannabe assholes in line like that give me chills.
1:13 lol, who looks up like that waiting to take another punch🤦🏼‍♂️
Best movie  i've seen in a long time. Please make more.😊😊😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This movie is 10/10, I love it how the protagonist blocks fist with his face and shows how vulnerable he is like all of us.. *cough cough* *steven seagal*
Godo movie but way too similair to John Wick, sometimes it feels like a copy paste Not bad, but way too overrated
John wick's long lost twin.
Wow.. the 5-on-1 fight scene in the bus is one of the best ever..
Well the movie was pretty lame
Is he another John Wick
From that clip, the fight scenes were badly choreographed, the acting is bad and the lead actor isn't good enough for what the role needs
2:43 When you need to call Saul.   Seriously though, this looks great. Looking forward to it.
Is this sam fischer
I'm imagining Liam Neeson in this role.
1:14 song name ???
damn saul you changed ..
the only movie i watch 2 time in 12hours
Ooh, John Wick for old geezers….slippin’ Jimmy on steroids! I’m not sure this will do well, you know…..
Jason Statham from Wish
Saul good man✌😹🔥
Is this copy of the family man ?
#Can anyone just tell me the bgm name?
just watch today .. brilliant movie.. my top 3 parts is 1.female hacker scared when find out hutch identity 2.Hutch dad first kill scene😂 (thought hes weak coz old) 3.when he buying warehouse
Better call Soul !
killer side of saul goodman, much stronger than mike ehrmantraut haha. one of the best movie i ever watched
Great movie 👌👌
2:46
This movie was a badass. Really worth watching.
Who does their technical research? A 72' Challenger with a 4.9 litre?! The hell! It's a 70', and none of the available engines were 4.9 litres. They were 7.2, 7.0 litre, 6.3 or 5.4 litres. Or in English/American 440, 426, 383 or 340 cubic inches....all legends in their own right.  No need to make up BS, meaning nothing to anyone, with a made up engine size and incorrect, and very much lessor model  year of the iconic Challenger(72').  Good movie but serious technical goofs like that, really take away from it.  Malcolm Ottawa Valley
Thats alot of crimes being committed in this trailer. He’ll need some serious legal representation. He better call Saul.
Nobody 2 Nobody 3 Nobody 4 Nobody 5 Waiting to release ❤️🔥
This movie was epic from start to finish, god damn. If you haven't watched it, DO IT.
Hmmm..A History of Violence remake?  A little too similar.
Somebody call saul :P
Just watch the movie and you'll end up watching again.
0:28 jimmy still has that wm logo.
That fucking Nobody..
Mom surprised Saul could be an action star too, this showed us all huh
This is like John Wick lol
Was a great movie, hoping for a sequel!! 👍👍
John Wick has Nobody!
The best
Saul still looking for his 17%
Awesome film! Loved it 👌
Its 2022 and i watched it for the 7th time....this is some absolute john wick friendly film⚡
Giving me a kind of John Wick vibe....
0:41
so weird to see Saul like this
It has John wick essence ..
So in this movie Saul Goodman has to act like Walter White
Nobody - Bob Odenkirk - severmuzzic  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP7J12vUDtw&t=59s
honestly when i first saw the trailer i was alil hating like its a john wick knock off but holy shit was i wrong. prob the best movie of 2021 prob 2022 too
The crappy version of John Wick.
Awesome movie
Damn Saul what the fuck happened?
Pleeeeeese keep’em coming for 22
Omg..in theaters February!!!??!!..this is a movie to watch 3 times in the theater
Kudos everyone involved..hadn’t seen something this good in yeeers..sooo fucking og..so awesome
The best I have ever watch this movie is 10/100
0;06 OMg😱 Suddenly 🤭
My only regret here is that I rented it instead of buying it! Wow, just wow…
After many many years we are blessed with this kind of movie
This was a pleasant surprise. Great movie
“In theaters only". Nobody will watch 😉
Such straightforward movie! I enjoyed this better that 'Don't Look Up'. You need to watch this :)
okay call saul 😀
how am i so late
Son of John Wick
why he not a lawyer
John wick with short hair...
John Wick, Joker, RED, Home Alone.
the best movie ever 👏👏👍 Saul is the man
10/10 Saul’s
The best :)
Saul Badman😅
2:09
Nobady🤦‍♂️
Reżyser i scenarzysta powinni poddać się do dymisji? Czemu?? Bo zjebało cały film scenami z niedopasowaną muzą do scen, i na odwrót i przez to wygląda to jak przekręcony John Wick wymuszony scenami od Tarantino? Kurwa.
Bra y’all comments and reviews never miss. Every time y’all say it’s good that’s what it is. When y’all say it’s horrible then that’s what it is💯💯💯
So basically this is John Wick, if he had a family..
When john wick calls Saul
John wick vibes....
bruh they need to make a sequel called “Somebody”
“You should see the other guys’ faces..”     Me: “oh right, you can’t.. coz they’re dead!”. Ah, yes. “Dad” jokes
Don't call 911. Coz you better call Saul 😁
wooow
Por poco y ponen toda la película en este trailer. De por gusto ir a verla si aquí ya está el resumen jajajajajj
Ah, there is still good movies in 2021
Multiverse of Saul
This is a brilliant over-the-top action movie similar to John Wick or the Equalizer in which the actors and stunt performers give it their all. The extras showing how it was made are almost as good. Glad I bought the DVD.
Is this movie good?
فيلم في غاية الروعة والجمال
the equaliser type
They show you the whole movie in 1 trailer. No need to see it.
"Remember who we used to be? I do."  And I remember when Hollywood used to make bad-ass movies like this (Rambo, Die Hard).  This movie is downright awesome. Thank you Universal Studios! Keep 'em coming!!!!
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatafaak is that.
'Nobody' was a character and spaghetti western, produced in the 70's , watch it,  you will love it. Terence Hill and Bud Spencer did a slew of these, unforgettable, 'Nobody' was  one of their finest.
rip kika
I wish they make a cross over between John wick and Hutch. It would be fire 🔥🔥🔥
This is a badass movie. Loved every piece of it. *Nobody*
JHON WICK remastered....BUT NOT BAD
I just saw the whole movie in 1 trailer.
11:13 I am this fat because I’ve you in my heart.
from better call saul to don't call 911
Feel sorry for poor Russian Gangsters all fault is with nobody's little girl and that god damn Kittycat Bracelet is responsible for the whole movie to happen lol so hate that Kittycat bracelet
"All this over what a hello kitty bracelet"  "It wasn't just a hello kitty bracelet"
When you Dont Call Saul...

If it weren't for the kitty cat bracelet, ALLLL OF THIS would've never happened.
i wonder if they wanted to cast jason statham first...this is 100% his MO
Walther White -> From comedic dad to drug kingpin Jessie Pinkman -> From meth cook to Illegal street racer Saul Goodman -> From the best lawyer to nobody
Saul Goodman Speedy Justice for you...
asshole son though.   did they reconcile?
I want a first person version of this.
Best action movie I seen in a long  time 💯
aight
Oh shit! We're getting a classic action movie? Gotta watch that!
That fucking awesome movie I missed. ❣️❣️
Best film I've seen all year. Good story, violence and wicked humour 😎👍👍👍
Love this actor & this seems like a bad ass role for him buuuuuuuuuuuuut why they always gotta come out with a comical version of a serious project (John Wick).
Rent it off Amazon and glad i did. Really great movie. Hoping for a sequel but if not its still a good one shot.
How Law Abiding Citizen should have been.
@1:23 For 12 years I've worked for some very dangerous people....  Is he referring to period of his first appearance in Breaking Bad... just a thought
Waoow didn't expect that if u searching a good movie like me this the 1 for u excellent :-)
Better Call Saul
“Who are u?”  *hero* “Kyle Rittenhouse”
Nobody knows me 🥺😤🦾👿
Can somebody please tell name of the song at 1:12
this can be john wick ?
omg i wish i was him
Amazing movie, pure action, loved it!
I was unable to take this movie seriously. It went beyond the suspension of disbelief. No depth. Far fetched impractical on every level. This movie falls flat. I've read the comments.. This movie is the opposite of a masterpiece. There was nothing realistic about this movie. People's have no idea what they are talking about. Flawed movie. Spoiler Alert.. It's Sacrilege to burn your record collection. Bob Odenkirk has left himself nowhere to go now.
Great movie
We need a cross over with John Wick
One of the best edge of your seat action movie 🎬 of the year hands down.👌🔥
Awesome movie!
Badass as f
If u r thinking that u should watch or that : guys u have to understand that john wick is on another level it's a cheap version of john wick , but it doesn't mean that it was boring or something ...if u hv free time and watch a quick action movie than it is for u  7.1/10
I thought this would some lame ass movie about some guy's boring routine. I was avoiding to watch it..... Turned out to be one of the best movies i saw :3
I was laughing out loud :D
One ting I learend after watching  John Wick and  Nobody & seeing n observing  my Grandpa.. "never mess with a quiet retired person". 😂😂
What a movie 🔥
Can somebody please give this man a pencil, oops i mean Kitty cat bracelet 🤭
Interviewer: Who Are You?  Charles Manson: Nobody
Glad that action movies have become more realistic with the fight scenes recently. Very impressive!
Bob Odenkirk is great!!
best action movie in the history of the human race
I hate trailers like this, they literally spoil the whole movie, the whole bus scene was a massive plot twist and anyone watching this stupid trailer already knew what would happen. It's just silly.
Super movie ❤️
better than john wick, there i said it
It's gene
Then John Wick suddenly shows up looking for his dog bringing with him his pencil.
Why does every action movie have to have an unrelatable protagonist who's secretly a special agent who's had years of training? Just once, I'd like to see an action movie where the main character is just a normal guy to whom the audience can relate and he saves the day relying only on his intelligence and the means available to him
I like to apologize to absolutely nobody.
Next generation of john wick movie
Is that saul?
This guys is so dangerous🥵😈 He  is definitely john wick old version…
The fact that it’s even done by the John Wick people shows how much it sucks. It’s the EXACT SAME GUY AND PLOT AND UNIVERSE. Just let “John Wick” be the one in this role 🙄 don’t need to copy/paste spin-offs… everyone involved is void of creativity.
Great.
I said I wouldn"t watch this movie for free. Then I ended up renting it and enjoying it. touche
Excellent  film
Viva la RZA.... great movie happy to see a hiphop legend on the big screen
I'm somewhat of a MIke Ehrmantraut myself
Just waiting for this assassin's universe more.. And john wick and nobody in a movie
Excellent movie!! 5+
BEST MOVIE I WATCHED IN A WHILE! GREAT ACTION, STORY!
1:12 which song is it any1 ?
That fucking "nobody " is Hutch Mansell  🔥
Jon Wick was a good movie but I personally liked this movie better.
Wonderful ... Love that kind of movie ;)!!
superb action packs movie its like John wick  antagonized by a Russian  mapia..great story . hope they make sequel of this movie
He should team up with John Wick. Don't kill a man's dog, and don't steal a man's daughter's kitty cat bracelet.
After that whole ordeal, he better call Saul
So this is Saul Goodman becomes john wick?
Excellent movie and well worth the watch! Bob Odenkirk was well cast, and gave a fantastic performance. Hope to see him in more roles.
I fear it would turn to be 4 1. Nobody 2. Somebody 3. Everybody 4. Anybody
Mike Ehrmantraut taught him well...
TOTAL IDIOTS !!!!!!!!!   when you start adding to the movie after the credits are rolling you need to warn people!!!!!!!!  all the lights comes up and everyone starts leaving...   so sick of not watching the whole movie.. if you have something to say before the credits , then just f...ing say it. now i dont know what happened after the credits rolled..  !!!???
Why does he just have a cat eating on the table in the interrogation room
why havent I heard of this film before looks great!
I watched this before I knew anything about it.. .. and it was awesome!!!   I didn't expect any of what happens in this movie.. so refreshing. Bob Odenkirk played his role perfect.
This is such a fun action film, it's so refreshing seeing a new face in an action movie.
Hooooold on. I just watched this movie last night. What happened to this creditor that is aware of his resurrection? I don't remember that ever being a thing in the movie.
After I saw this movie's opening scene with Hutch on monday/tuesday etc.. I immediately thought of Harold Smith in PowerPuff Girls xD
Loved this movie 9/10! Who called him on the realtor's phone?
Idk if this is true but is Tobey Maguire in this movie?
WTF Saul Goodman is here
Don't make this kind of psychopath movies buddy!
Come on! I am the biggest fan of John Wick. But this movie is fuckin' brutal nonsense. Hollywood is getting shit.
I thought this movie was about a nobody becoming a somebody by taking action in his life an uses it his advantage like wolf dressed as sheep. In way it was but in that cliche John Wick way where he already was a preexisting badass. Action was on point though, that was satisfying.
This trailer sucks.
Mantap
John wick with a family
Usual shite too afraid to be against the real street problems so try make Russians the bad guys. garbage film.... like watching Spiderman take down multi ethnic muggers... Lmfao!!
Somebody Call Saul .....Oh wait
hutch pops is john wick in the future
Better call Saul !!! SAUL GOOD MAN !!!
I watched this. It's so great how the b guy steps in to save the day. Like in so many important world conflicts where the good guys won like Realism Always.
Lol so it's john wick again, just with a kitty cat bracelet instead of a dog..
btw director - Ilya Naishuller, director of  "Hardcore Henry".
Thanos questioning his existence when he saw Hutch's tatoo
It is like Jhon wick. But his wife didn't die.  And most important... He has a kitty.
This is the kind of movie that everyone should watch, BEFORE watching the "previews".
great fucking movie. better than john wick.
This so good I'm not going to steal it from the Davenport library
I just watched this movie and i specifically got on here just to say. This is by far the dumbest movie iv ever seen. And iv seen some dumb movies. Terrible.
2021: He was Nobody 2022: Until Somebody broke into his house  2023: Now Everybody is after him   John Wick
Things I learned from this movie 1 Sal Goodman is John Wick 2 Russian population is 5% less now 3 visit Russia 🇷🇺 now, safest country in the world, zero mafia
10/10  You feel bored the first half because you feeling what Hutch feel, but it will not last long. It's get better. It was funny too, made me chuckled. The action is fantastic. Fast-moving
What if John Wick wife didn't die
I got recommended this movie by Critical Drinker. I loved this funny, refreshing take on a retired agent. Fantastic family elements throughout. Already bought this to keep.
WTF
John wick: all of this over a puppy??  Nobody: give me the goddam kitty cat bracelet!!!!
Awesome movie!! Yeah!!!
Interesting twist on Jimmy.
Are ceva din Bad Ass, ceva din Umbre, ceva din Joker... Și ar mai fi, dar astea mi-au venit în minte acum!
This f*cking nobody is John Wick changed his name to Hutch Mansell and shapeshifters to an old little man’s body.
Ah, I get it, it's like one of those 80's vigilante Charles Bronson movies meets The Purge.
american movie from russian director...
Woa even Christopher Loyd is in this one. Never thought I'd see him in a movie like this. Tough old guy for his age heh. Anyone know who he is still? Anyways I am happy this was a good movie.
I can't believe Hollywood still does that stupid shit at 1:08, 1:09. Who punches the back of someone's hand and shakes it because it hurts? 🤣 And then proceeds to stand there like an idiot to allow the hero to elbow him in the face.
One kills for a dog and another kills for a kitty cat bracelet?
The family version of john wick
Old version of John Wick.
Freakin awesome film!
One hell of a movie.... I loved it👍🏻
Part serious, mostly spoof, all fun. Filled with tons of subtle gags, even in the action scenes, that may go unnoticed. Makes fun of the typical action movie, but also embraces it. Very predictable at times, even cliche, but still a heck of a ride.  Not everything in this trailer is actually in the movie... maybe it'll find it's way into the sequel if they make one. Not sure I want them to make a sequel (even though I want to see more), as it could take away from the magic of this one. Would be cool to see Odenkirk get a cameo in John Wick 4... Wick asks him, "who are you?", to which, he of course says "I'm nobody".
Please make Nobody 2! Thank you. 🥰
best action movie of all time!
Is this on Netflix?
What is the song name ?

From Better Call Saul to Better Call an Ambulance
Is that saul goodman
“What’s happening?” “It’s all good, man”
This movie is wild , Love it lots of action and good plot . Talking about black to the future .
a sick movie, just like the USA is a sick nation. And then you are surprised that every year in a school, a teenager kills 50 students. Soon, in USA will every nobady have a gun and kill somebody.
The man from nobody, who can play anybody! Keep it up, buddy!
Just imagine nobody And john wick together in one movie 😌
THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO GOOD!
missing doom music
i see walter white in the character
That fucking “nobody” is John Wick
I hope he gets the kitty cat bracelet back! 😾
One common man , the cool killer , the gangsters enemy's , action block blaster rounds
What a mind blowing movie 🔥❤

I watched this and to summarized, John Wick if he was a cat person
Great movie
nobody is a old john wick
This is finer than a motherfuckr, but i think the sequel of this will be emotional. Pops can be killed or the black guy  but its still good
awesome movie
Has anyone found the beat at 1:12
This movie is an underrated masterpiece
Really good american movie, kind of gory
Absolutely LOVED this film. Kudos to everyone involved. Great work x
I absolutely loved this movie . I didn't want to know to much about it , as trailers show far to much , however as it was written by the same guy who wrote John Wick I really should have guessed what was coming . Another good film added to my collection ......
Jimmy :)
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!" And that's when you know, this movie is a must watch!
Don't call 911 Better call Saul
Triples of the Nova
One of the best action movies this year!!!! So much fun.. awesome!!!!
This movie felt super socially distant and low budget. But not in a bad way
1:24 Those dangerous people are Walter White And Jesse Pinkman...
This is the new age Kevin from Home Alone
I m fucking watching this….
The movie is 100% satisfiying and the best action movie in 2021 so far....
To whoever is reading this, i just want you to know that this is one of the best movies ive watched in a long ass time. I highly recommend watching it till the end
My man saul .
This was way better than John Wick..
One of the best action movies I have seen in years.
I wouldn't have thought that it's possible to say "kitty cat bracelet" and make it sound badass.
Better Call Saul. U will need a lawyer. 😁
This is John Wick lol
I just watched the movie it's awesome
This Trailer never gets old.
I wish to watch this movie for the first time again please
This is one of those trailers,that doesn't make me excited at all
A budget of only $16 million and grossed 4 times that. Pretty successful I'd say :) Brilliant film.
John Wick: Guy hell bent on a revenge for his dog and his car Nobody: Guy just needs his exercise for stress relief
This was one of the worst movies I ever paid to see. More typical of stream service movies that are rushed through with porous plot lines, bad scripting and single take direction.  The shit heap movie rates 84% on Rotten Tomatoes because ,I believe, reviews were hijacked by vested interests.   Note that the vastly superior John Wick and The Equalzer, of which Nobody heavily borrows, have ratings of 86% and 60% respectively.
That fucking nobody is Jhon Wick
Best movie of 2021. Enough said.
looks like "Nobody" can defend himself both in and out of court
john wick copy paste :S
What is the name of the song
This is a goddamn masterpiece!
I'm expecting comedy on this one and found badassery
The best thing in 2021
Mr. Nobody: Who took my Kitty? John Wick: Who killed my dog? Nickolas Cage in 'Pig':  Give me my Pig back
This movie is so fucking awesome !! I watched it today and i'm going to watch it again tomorrow ,
Ya know, that ole boy  in the punisher, would be a good team up with this bad azz dude.  It would be, Glorious.
like Movie ''JOHN WICK''
Damn!! Saul is a bad boy.
um? hell ya, gonna see it.........
What is the song at 1:14 ?
Судя по комментам мир изменился, всем сопли с супергероями подавай! Глянул тизер, в киношку пойду обязательно🤘.
Ohhh shit!!!! Saul Goodman goes John wick 🤣
I enjoyed  it up till the cavalry arrived in the last scenes and then it occurred  too late what a shameless rip off of John Wick this was
Uhm ... whatever you do, don't touch that kitty cat bracelet!
Better Call Saul!
This song is hype af.  Movie pretty sweet too.
Bob Odenkirk is hilarious
Wow! Talk about "over-the-top" violence. This film has it and a sense of humor as well.
Just watch the great fight clips and forget this dog turd of a movie. The script and direction runs like it was done by a glue-sniffing fifteen year old who had only ever seen Quentin Tarantino movies.
*”Copy my homework but don’t make it too obvious”*
WOW this mans balls have definitely enlarged since his old encounters with Walter
I LOOOOOOOVED this movie!
Looking forward to see Mr.nobody and baba yaga together in a movie called killbuddies
I'm loving the Better Call Saul extended universe.
Bruh
just imagine to see mr nobody and John wick together 😜😍
Of course it's white guys he beats up. That's how we know it's fiction.
Action. Thats it action. Seems legit. Lets hope they dot pull no political bs. But lmao dont kid myself.
This movie was amazing
so this is the guy about whom they discussed a potential crossover with John Wick, hehe.
is this movie good? i wanna watch it but i dont wanna waste my time if it isnt
И это только за браслет с котиками... задели б посильнее, вынес целую армию...
шняга .. есть немного реальные бои
Pretty good movie
Seeing Christopher Lloyd still alive makes me happy
Polyfimos: Who the fuck are you? Odysseus: I'm nobody
Must watch 10/10 very entertaining
So you guys mean to tell me I'm the only one who noticed the "WM"  on his cup at the beginning of the trailer is the same name of the law firm on "Better Call Saul?"
triple kill sniper
Plz tell me which music this is🎶
A better version of john weak
Saul got mad!
filmaço selocou
this movie is crazy good! best movie so far 2021. if you like action this is for you.
Way better than expected. This was perfect😂💥🥊💯
POV: you didnt call saul
I wish to God I was like Irma Thurman or some type of badass I can't even run
What can't he do! I can't wait to watch this. He's amazing. I just hope that he does okay with recovery and really takes it easy for his heart he's way too young and he's so darn talented.
Best movie
1:44 Thats some trigger disciplined shit
What a Action🤯🤯
That nobody lays down the foundation of what we are now. From the movie Jon wik.
I love how he curses multiple times but John wick never sayed a bad word
Isallgoodman
He sounds like Clint Eastwood. Whenever Clint speaks, shits gettin' real.....
I finally watched this movie last night and it is much better than I expected. I do not like to give any spoilers when talking about a movie, so I will say it is well worth $6!
I'm here after watching the movie.. it's a masterpiece
This what happen when you stole a kitty cat bracelet.
When Saul Goodman goes to John wick
at first, the idea that this movie is about a man that refused to "potentially kill another human "  and started having society and the world on his head for not properly acting like a "man" that should defend his family  fucking him up in the processes would have been a nice drama.
So this is Saul's El Camino.....
Hutch > Wick
Saul goodman vs John wick
please do a movie about mike also
Its all good man
*Better Call Saul!*
The makers listened to the advice - "better call saul"
After watching all his Conan appearances, seeing Saul and now this....Bob is definitely underrated! Great actor and comedian
This is an excellent trailer. The first time I saw it, for the forst 30 seconds or so I thought it was gonna be a midlife crisis drama.
I'm a father and sometimes day dream of these type of things. 😂
"Nobody" as in "No body" cuz they never find the bodies.
No pencil tonight..
For you who dont know, This film and John Wick was written by the same guy Derek Kolstad. So I think we will have a crossover of two films
This is a great movie, I think it connected to John Wick
How come the dont know how to make trailer?
Couldn't get over how much weight Michael Ironside has put on.
Where is tobey Maguire
I just seen this movie, awesome!! It's John Wick meets Home Alone. My favorite part was when he erased the tally on the "last injury" board. Saul Goodman pulled it off. Great movie.
This seems extremely similar that movie  to A History Of Violence
Great movie! Unlike the garbage that's been coming out
To those who have watched the movie, if you ever notice in this trailer at (2:30) he roll a grenade while in the movie (in 1:07:30) he rolled an improvised jar bomb. Watch it again.
One heck of a movie 🎥
John Wick : Real life Edition
"Give me goddam kitty cat bracelet!!"

John wick , soul goodman version ..
Background music is like indian bhojpuri tadka
I thought he was John Wick's older brother. 😅
Just finished watching "Better call saul" & now i can't imagine him being a deadly killer
Don't call 911 😂😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Should've called Saul
hey nobody, better call saul
Nobody or John Wick..... Mine vote is john Wick
It's all good man
Yehhh... this is really badass...  Action 95% Acting 88% Cast 90% Drama 82% Overall 91% Must watch.. highly recommended..  Yess.. it is John wick level movie...
Don't call 911.. eventually they gonna come late 😂
*Don't* *Call* *911* 😁 *Best* *Movie* 🔥🔥🔥
The most awaited crossover: Nobody, John Wick and The Equalizer
I like this movie a lot. Like if you agree.
What a movie hats off
So he really took Lalo's words seriously after all
Saul badassman
Saul and Back to the Future, couldn't get much better than that :D
this is gene after telling the disappearer that he'll deal with it himself at the start of season 5 of better call saul
Gotta be a cult classic in 2050 😁😁
Pesima  pelicula.. para los descerebrados que gustan de la pornografia de la violencia..guion malo... no tiene nada  de bueno  es copia  de todas las peliculas  de ese genero...
i wish i could do this when it was needed
fucckkk this is what i like to see!!!!!
John Wick : its all started with the dog Nobody : well its becoz of the cat 🤣
Is he better call saul
Great movie..quite realistic actions, triple head shot..loved it
The best movie i love it 😂👍
So much better than the unfinished, slow burn of BCS.
Nice movie
This movie was awesome.  It's weird how a movie with so much death and destruction made me feel so good and cheer for the (good guy) killers.
Where I can watch this movie in hindi
Yay can’t wait to watch
Rorshach John Wick All in One!
If you like this watch the  Aussie series Mr Inbetween..👍
yo no soy un abogado
Walter to the Vaccum man: Saul is coming with me, I need him. Saul: I am not your lawyer, the fun is over, I am Nobody.
Movie was amazing. Just finished it
0:55 those bad boys hahaha nice haircut by the way.
It is cool seeing him get a new diverse role. Everyone knows him because of Saul Goodman.
Damn if only they could've made him look this young for BCS.
Fing kitty cat bracelet
Me and my dad watching this movie and he sing all of the song because he is Singer   Great Father bonding nice movie
Watched it, one word "Brutal" .
This is like John Wick but more relatable.

Unbelievable. I couldn't believe it's the same guy acted as Saul.
movie was amazing
Don't call 911😳
Finished reading Fight Club. Seen the movie. Now this. Awesome.
Doom brought me here
Worth to watch
Fantastic film
Ok, after 0:56 i definitely gonna watch this bad boy.
It’s not just a movie , it’s a masterpiece 🙌
I loved comments more than the trailer 😂
How can I just get this nobody sound clip version?
I hope this becomes a franchise, as it has lot of back story and for his father and brother! It is Jhon Wick and it is NOT
Illuminati symbolism spotted at 2:39. Hollywood can't help themselves. They HAVE to insert that sh*t.
He is the real danger than walt
Is this movie is available on Netflix..?
GREAT MOVIE 👍
Interrogator: Who the eff are you? Protagonist: Me?...I'm <INSERT TITLE OF MOVIE>  Stellar and creative dialogue right there...🙄
idk why I had a feeling that his father and the sniper guy would die but they didnt
This is brutal!!! We need more !!! 🔥💯
Better than John Wick trilogy combined
I'm glad I didn't see the trailer or know anything about the movie when I saw it. I thought he was just a nobody until he started kicking ass.
John wick but better
Get well Mr. Odenkirk. We want a sequel!
https://youtu.be/HO0ps9wc7vk
This is one of the best action movie ever!!!!
From the Criminal lawyer to the guy who work in Cinnabon and now become Nobody, how many more Bob
he's going to need one hell of a lawyer to cover all these assault cases
1:34 "Don't Call Saul" lol
Nice to see Nobody, Kong vs Godzilla, Demon Hunter, Quiet Place 2, Conjuring 3 being box office hits in post-vaccination times in theaters and i saw them all in theaters. No 'woke' political agenda, no moral lecturing, no message. Just pure entertainment is what audiences want.  I Saw it 2 times in theaters early april after my shots along with Kong vs Godzilla and felt good to see movies in theaters again and glad pure entertainment that isn't woke/SJW/virtue signaling political bullshit agenda nonsense is making a comeback by filmmakers who care about entertainment as these types of movies succeed where SJW/woke pandering movies fail and maybe this will wake up Hollywood and make them change their minds
Don't watch the trailer, go see the movie right away!
This is the moment Saul became heisenburg
such a trash! He is too weak and thin to play this role! Director is simply... it is pain and embarassing to watch. Music "wannabe" Tarantino...  And grandpa bad boy... he cant even walk.  Bad aśs girls in the movie 😆...  His brother is black for no reason... nice touch SJW!   and and and...
I'm glad Saul is finally standing up for himself.  But the writing seems sub par.
am I the one who only thinks he is the same actor Rick Grimes from TWD when looking at the thumbnail
Genre: Very painful retired man.
This guy is one of the fookin Peaky blinders
I hate when they put the whole movie 8n the trailer..  FU******
Equalizer , john wick.
this plot literally not even what the movie is about...
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAM KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!"
Shits going down.. I better call Saul.
i hope he’s ok 💓 cannot believe he had a heart attack
i just watch and it's soooooooooo goooood!!!!!!!
Brilliant work from all who made this action movie
maaaan this movie is sooo good. You need to watch it!
😊"Everyone dies.....some sooner than others"😊
Loved this movie
This kinda looks like a rebooted version of John wick, wonder if this will be in the same world as John wick. Would be cool to see a crossover
We may have seriously underestimated Saul.
Moral:- one bullet is enough for three people and Basement is important😁
Im so glad that Saul isn’t working in a Cinnabon anymore.
John wick but older
"GIVE ME THE KITTY CAT BRACELET"
And all this because of a kitty cat bracelet...
0:29 that’s literally Wexler McGill from BCS
It's like The Family Man Hollywood version.
Saul finally was breaking bad with a vengeance.
Get well, Bob.
1:34 thought he was gonna say : Dont call Saul !
The last shooting was awesome
Not john wick not Nobody. Johan is best. You don't mess with Johan 🔫
Amazing
john wick meets nobody :3
I enjoyed this movie
"You brought alot of shotguns" "You brought alot of Russians!"
Hey guys, you know whats the response to the question ''Who asked?''    This movie's title
For me one of the movie ever !
This was so much better than I ever expected. 100% would recommend.
A history of violence meets john wick?
Grandpa wick
Did he just hit a triple collate?
I sure hope Bob Odenkirk is okay after he collasped on the set yesterday (07-27-2021).  If anyone finds things out, please, let me know.  I really like B-O ...
RIP
This is so much better than John Wick!
I'm so glad I didn't saw the trailer before the movie.
Just finished watching. Wow wow wow that's amazing filim .
Call an Ambulance, but not for Me! Nobody: *D O N T  C A L L  9 1 1.*
"That fucking "Nobody" is John Wick."  - Viggo Tarasov
I get it that it's a great movie. I just wonder whether there is some unspoken agreement that once you are a successful actor you have to do action movies.
That fuckin' john wick, is nobody...
watched this before watching Breaking Bad and Better Caul Sau, hes such a great actor
Just watched this and loved it Bob Odenkirk is on form and still got Better Call Saul Season 6 yet 🥳🥳🥳
nobody
John Wick cat version
What do you want? Jhon Wick: Justice Hutch Mansell:  kitty cat bracelet.
Lol how cringy are these people on the comments this movie copied from the movie equalizer still it's so bad
Great movie
Love the movie hope for nobody2 -3
Finally a movie in 2021 that's not about LGBTQ or Racism ....
A must watch
Initially thought it was just another low budget movie with cheap action plots. Decided to gave it a shot and never regretted my decision.
I'm just a Saul who's intentions are good..
This movie is about 90 minutes long yet it took me nearly 10 hours over 3 days to finish watching it cause I was rewinding every cool scene over and over and again before I got to the credits \o/
Don't know how all you guyz liked the movie , the script is ruined by old gysers, average acting , average screen play and lot of cuts . "Wrath of a man" is better than this.
Interesting that Walter Steele’s narration at 2:00 is not in the final film and also doesn’t even quite line up with the story of the film… I wonder if there was a rewrite in the motivation of who was out to get him and why
Dad Wick
Spoiler...in the post credit scene , John Wick visits Hutch and says “ I’m putting a team together, you in? “
My my 😰
Just watched this movie. EXCELLENT! Highly recommended. LOVED Breaking Bad and Better call Saul. Loved Odenkirk and he carried over easily into this role.
damn...must be some kitty cat bracelet to do that.
Insanos
Now Mike fear Saul.
Simple action movie with good sequences but nothing new here. BTW John Wick fan :)
February 26th.  Hmmmm.
Oh this movie is a BRAVO *clap*
Just watched for the 2nd time in less than 12 hours.  Love this movie.  Had very stressful week and decided to rent this movie.  I am so glad I did.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea , that being said to see a man clearly feeling disillusioned with the daily grind , become I am just not taking anymore man was outstanding!  This is my feel good movie of the year.  For me it was as if John Wick and Red had a baby and his name is Nobody.  Please do not let this be that movie whose ending promises another but does not follow through.
This movie is the real 100/10
Lol another Bruce Willis copy 😹😸👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
My gawd I'd been waiting for years for a movie this good.  Thank you Bob Odenkirk thank you Ilya Naishuller
Don't call 911. 😅
Is this ready on netflix ??
he just wants the kitty cat bracelet..that's all
They need to make a crossover with Nobody, John Wick, Equalizer, and Taken.
I keep coming back to this trailer, I don't know why.😉👊👊
If Walter white, Saul, and John wick was all one person. Never expected him to have a role like this. It's like Jim Carrey coming out with an action movie.
This guy and john wick need to do a crossover
If these were the 90s, we would get an amazing John Wick vs Nobody movie.
i think with all this crime, he better call saul
Fuckin great movie! I don't say that very often
I didn’t know Saul Goodman can fight like that 🤣
Nobody vs. John wick?
My only issue with this movie, it's incredibly short :( WE WANT MORE OF THIS PLS
Nobody vs John Wick
*turns on flashlight* "PTZZZZJJJJJJJJ!!!!!"
Awesome  makes me feel like taking a pissed on blm members and white supremacist
i do not remember if i saw this or not ... i guess gonna watch it then ...
Im gonna keep this as my WA status when I change my corporation . After 12 years.. 😁 I mean it
Just found out about this movie today. It looks pretty cool! Will give it a watch.
This movie has no business being as good as it is!
Over rated, waste of time
It ls just a prequel, real story will start when mob gangsters kill his cat
Am here to watch trailer before downloading as to confirm its good or bad .....now am definitely going to watch this movie 😌😌
1:34 better call saul
At first I didn't recognize that it's saul
Jimmy Goodman is in action👍😹
John wick father 👍
Loved it! I guess the title is Nobody cause My Name Is Nobody was taken.
He about to kill a man for a kitty cat bracelet for his daughter, respect
He's just fu@%$# nobody! Boss: that fu@#$% nobody is joh..........uhmm... hutch mansell!
Mel gibson is crazy
And the cliches abound, "you should see the other guys"    ( catch the plural)
Just watch it.
This is basically John Wick's Old man
I'm not paying 15 quid to rent this on amazon 🤦🏽‍♂️
Best ever trailer seen so far 😊
You better call Saul ,because nobody cares
The fighting scenes in this movie are so realistic..
Nobody deserves a good beating ....
If they successfully managed to make that cucumber of an actor, Keanu Reeves, a successful action star, they could very easily use someone with an actual talent, impressive acting skill and imposing presence for another such role.
When they sang "You'll Never walk Alone" 😋
Somekind of Rambo Die Hard thinggy happen arround here.. the key is simple 1 man will kill all badguys or russian mob in a blink of the eyes and for sure hero will survived. Bob Odenkirk welcome to Rambo & Die Hard Club.. meet Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallon at bars.
Christopher Lloyd's performance deserves an Oscar Nomination. Best actor in a supporting role.
Wow 👀 😲, Great film, I didn't expect it to be so good, my only regret is not watching this at the theater. It will keep you at the edge of your seat.
1:12 song? It sounds good
Everybody's talking about Saul, but no one notices Doc from BTTF 0:41.
All for a goddamm kitten bracelet that was never stolen .
David Leitch makes sure the brain damaged fans of John Wick get what they want - another brainless John Wick flick, just with a different actor, that is not John Wick and the numbnuts will yell, "HE IS SUCH A GEENIUZ!", while drooling, each eye looking in different directions and defecating themselves with joy.
Saul good man!
After watching the bus scene I need to watch this movie now. I wonder if this guy lives in the same world as John Wick.
I'm out.. No need to pay me. Good luck! 😅
Just found out that the cinematographer of this movie is the one that did for both Hereditary and Midsommar
Omg it’s Saul goodman
Action is good but story is very bad the main actor probably don't know what is he doing
Guys, get this.... John Wick, but with Bob OdenKirk!
Who gives the order to fill the singing scenes with that gay Illuminati, triangle fluorescent light imagery? Yet again we see it plastered everywhere. Lame.
This movie deserves more attention guys...👏👏👏
this movie was so much better than what this trailer showed it to be. Oh my sweet baby jesus lol.
Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad series, lol
1:34 Besides his family, the neighbours also took it seriously, there was gun shot, explosion but nobody could hear it.
Watched this movie two days back and it was fye🔥 I hope we're getting a sequel.
sometimes its always the best way to enjoy action movie, is to do not ever watch its trailer
maaaaan, Jimmy has really slipped this time.
Nobody, The Equalizer and John whick after John scapes they call Nobody to Audit the round table it's getting to messy for the government the Equalizer get caught in the middle of this war and John just wants to kill someone with a fucking pencil
I'm going to watch this, not for the cover. The trailer is everything. Okayyy 👏
Saw it..loved it.  Highly recommend it!! 5 out of 5.
Another movie made for an audience which has the attention span of a 8 yr old.....
We need part 2
All I can say is OMG darn good movie from start to finish
1:00 to 1:15  "I'm gonna f*** you up" Gangsters: *laughed* *So you have been chosen death*
I really enjoyed this movie,because I didn't fast forward once.
I am not on this bus with you, you are on this bus with ME
Good lord this looks terrible
Like බ්‍රෝ
Bob Odenkirk is now my new favorite actor. I always knew he was great from Breaking Bad, but since I never watched an episode of Saul; i will be binge watching it now. This dude is UNDERRATED as fuck.
Just finished watching it, it was surprisingly good and fun to watch. You won't get bored that's for sure 3.5/5
That's Saul goodman 😲😱 OMG..
Saw the movie and man it was fucking great, the dudes behind john wick was working on these, hope a sequal comes out soon.
English version of Basha! - "naan oruthadava sonna nuruthadava sonnamathiri!" - ennada nengalum copy adika arambitchutenga?
This would be the next John Wick
This the guy that Mr. Wick that failed to dismantle😁
Lession: Do not steal a Kitty Bracelet
Saul Badassman.
Just an amazing movie i've ever seen😳😳😳
Nice movie
Best movie!
He must be Saul Goodman's twin bro.... Saul Badman 😎
Saul Goodman is finally sending guys to "Belize"
Fek what!! Is this same as John wick????
I watched this, John Wick, and Equalizer  MY big question is ... what's with the Russian mob? Why are they always the main bad guys
this is the moment when jimmy mcgill became saul goodman
give me the God damn kitty cat bracelet 😂
Now here's the moment where Nobody BECAME Saul!!!
I WANT that blue & white polo shirt!
easily my favorite movie
im not into comments and shit and i just came here after watching the movie to say HOLY SHIIIIIIIT what a Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
John wick's dad
John wick's dad
Fuck, he will be Saul for me forever
Why is the Russian guy so crazy how did he get in this country.oh yes through mexico.
one of my favorite ♥️ movies since SHOOTER! 11/10 🔥
I check and it was directed by the same director of Hardcore Henry and member of Biting Elbows
Это шо, Паль?!
Loved the movie... made my blood pumping with all that rated r action scenes. I heard that the producer in this movie is also the producer of John Wick. If that's true, then time to watch John Wick
Вообще-то Джонатан Уик убивал не 73 человека а около 1456 по каждому фильму примерно. Хатч Мэнселл Никто, за браслета котиком убивал около 178 человека. Фильм шедевр 5 звёзды.
This new episode of Breaking Bad is pretty weird, huh?!!
John Wick  part 126 and a little crank !!
Faux bad ass BS.
: IN THEATERS ONLY FEBRUARY 26  ME: ... 43% download on pirate bay
Loved it!!!!!
Is he a former assassin? Or special forces?
When joker meets John wick
That fucking nobody is John wick !!
One of the best movies I’ve seen in a very long time. Bob Odenkirk did absolutely amazing
Pretty pretty good!
He is the boogeyman i think
So just another John Wick then.
So this is what he did after he was a lawyer?
I just watched this movie today, and I was laughing my ass off throughout 2/3 of it. The big problem was it was a Redbox rental, it had scratches on it and it skipped a couple of times while I watched it, so needless to say, I cannot wait to get back to Walmart, find an untouched version of this movie for sale and buy, so that whenever I have a bad day and are in need to laugh, and can watch it again and again, ‘cause (if honesty counts for anything) there’s nothing more amusing to me than being the guy who’s every asshole’s worst nightmare come true! 😆
Imagine if John Wick, Nobody and The Equalizer team up against the mafias :p
Damn this was a long trailer
it's like John Wick and Home Alone in the same movie.
What a crowd pleaser!! Action-packed and funny at the same time. #BobOdenkirk cemented himself as the next action hero. #RZA kick ass in this film but #ChristopherLloyd was a scene stealer.   For all you #JohnWick fans, This is worth seeing!!   10/10!
Good movie by the way. Worth the watch! 👍
Lalo: You are the right guy for this. You're Nobody Saul Goodman: Yeah Sure.
Amazing movie, the action and the pace of the movie felt so fresh. Great cast also.
Bloody hell best film I’ve seen in along long time griping just class.. seriously…. bravo .💣💣💣💣💣🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🪓🪓🪓🖼
Arthur Hobbs isn't fucking around on this one.
i would say the whole soundtrack is just, chef kiss
I watched this movie, 80%of the movie is total Badass but the end... The end was shittttt
Can’t wait for part 2
Really good movie, perfect length too!
People, even if the trailer sold out the movie, it does not matter, this was one hell of an enjoyable movie,
What is the name of music in trailer?
Bob has put in the work! Very excited for this.
*John Wicks Twin Brother*
Just bought this on blu ray hope it’s worth the money
Just finished it and i gotta say i really enjoyed it. Great movie👌🏻👌🏻
Kitty bracelet gets taken, begin the onslaught!!

Correct me if im wrong but the one in 2:06 was not in the movie
WOOW !, Bob Odenkirk is in "John Wick Mode"
Mixtures of - jhon wick[mostly], Dominic Toretto( burning money) & joker.
One of the most underated movies in years ! Bob acting is always good great i didn't disappointed !
he reminds me of joel miller from the last of us
After Jhonwick The one of the Best Action Movie I Had Seen 🙆
Showed way to much of the movie, your ruining it you dumb as trailers.
Most fun movie in many years. Loved it so much.
No half measures.
The other side of Saul Goodman 😡
son ;you look like shit dad dad; you should have seen the other guys
What is the name of the song played on 1:12 time slot?? Can anyone tell me ??
Baby, you understand me now. If sometimes see that I'm mad..
....🤔 ...if john wick had a brother ....it could be nobody...😅😅
i really didn’t expect this movie to be good but if you love action then you will love this movie.  Haven’t seen a movie like this in YEARSSSSSSS
Vandaag in cinema gezien en zeker de moeite waard. Kreeg flashbacks van Charles Bronson; Lucky Luck & Daltons en Home Alone. A senior
another John wick
i've watched this without knowing anyhing, i just saw the poster with odenkirk in a weird situation and i said OK. i was not disappointed
I think he should stick to being an attorney and leave the rest to John Wick. Nice movie though
Nobody aka Frank Castle? PUNISHER ~ the movie
NOBODY BETTER CALL SAUL!
Saul Goodman's evil twin for sure! 😄  A great movie by the way
is this a Better Call Saul sequel and a Breaking Bad sequel spinoff???
My favourite movie ❤️❤️❤️
This movie is shit do not watch it
Dad wick
nobody is here from hardcore henry
They shouldn't have taken the God damn kitty cat bracelet
"BOBODDY! BO-BODDY!"  - My colleague, probably.
I feel like John Wick, Taken, Nobody and Peppermint are telling me to be wary of my neighbours.
Well the movie is great but the role isnt for Bob odenkirk it just didnt fit him  ..
I hope he has a black old disk-telefone in his basement, then we all know what's up
Jeezus wtf happened Saul
Nobody literally nobody:
I get the feeling Steve Carrell could've played Nobody, idk why 😅😅
This movie was really good
Who will tell me what this music is because i wikliny fall asleep.
when the shit is going down is better call saul
Well this movie looks awesome i mean this definitely Movie of the Year this Guy giv3 some tough time to Liam Neeson Going to watch this ❤💯🔥
Better call saul season 7 leaked (after the walter white disaster)
Make a movie about a dog:  Sure, let's call it John Wick👍  Make a movie about a kitty cat bracelet:  Said "Nobody" ever 🤣

And there goes BB and BCS memes.. and I love it :'DD
*"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET"*
I'm gonna watch it!
,n
.
This should be the story of Mr. Nobody from F&F series.
Best movie ever ! Just done watching it 🙂
It is every bit as awesome as the trailer makes it out to be.  Watch this fricking movie.
I fuggin' LOVED this movie.
Very good film. Who knew saul would turn out to be a badass killing machine lol. 8/10 would recommend
That Fucking "NOBODY" is John Wick.
saul goodman took some mma lessons i see
and to think, Bob was an extra in Wayne's World 2
During VietNam, the 'Death Cards' were a real occurrence, always depicted as an ace of spades with a skull and crossbones in the spade. The movie, as to not takeaway from the soldiers of VietNam, came up with this offshoot variation; 7 of clubs and 2 of Diamonds tattoo. The other set depicted was 8 of hearts and 3 of diamonds cufflinks. What does that all mean? Both of those sets of cards, if dealt to you are the worst cards you can receive in Texas Hold'em. There's no playing those cards, just fold your hand, because you're out.
“Can we watch John wick” Mom: “we have John wick at home” John wick at home
The reason I want to watch this, is because of Bob Odenkirk, that’s it really. xD   *Better Call Saul!*
I want this on netflix so badly ,
hands down best action movie of the year
ALL HYPE. AVERAGE
John wick 4 :D
Damn Saul be getting violent
Saul goodman becomes fighting good,man
this is bettercallsaul season 6
When he is crossing his fingers hoping to get chased ☠️☠️
When he said "Don't call 911" I knew I was watching best movie of this year🖤
прошивка мозга очередная. Начало интригующее, до середины интересно, потом начинается политика и гнобление с русскими. Для русских не рекомендую, да и вообще не рекомендую . фуфло! да и эфиоп у них не тот, марионеточный чтоль, лучше на наши жмурки посмотреть, там хоть смешнее
What is the song called that briefly plays at 1:12-1:17 ?
I don't recommend watching any trailers these days. This one spoilers half the film. How stupid! I luckily already whatched the movie.
In the UK if you beat up an attacker your the one gets in trouble
***PSA*** I’m so glad I didn’t watch the trailer before the movie. If you just started the trailer, STOP and Watch the movie! It ruins it IMO because It reveals the main plot too much. Watched the movie yesterday and I can’t stop thinking about  it so I looked up the trailer…
Just saw it.  Lol it was well worth the rental cost.
Bet call Saul 😂
Leider mehr Fantasie und lustig als nötig aber sehr gut! ^^
I’ma pretend this is what happened after Breaking Bad
Spoilers for better call Saul s6
Check Out My Official Music Video Its Called "Nobody"  https://youtu.be/ff4dIclZrgM
Better Call John
Loved this movie! I am pretty sure they edited out a sub plot though...this preview has a voice over of someone saying he had a debt to pay and his previous creditor is aware of his "resurrection". Wonder if they left it out for a sequel plot.
BoB ODeNKiRK iS aWeSoMe
I want more movies likes this onggg
The part where the hacker tells her client that she doesn't need his money gave me goosebumps.
John Wick lite
Same director as Hardcore Henry, should be an awesome watch, definitely gonna look for it.
“I had 1.4 million on my desk and I didn’t take it, nobody knew we had it. Why?” “Said something about the right thing, I didn’t take it because it was a job” “We’ll I know what stopped me then and it’s not gonna stop me ever again”
love it
Walter White should stay clear of Nobody
Gene Takavic must have been really pissed off by that taxi driver approaching him during his Cinnabun work break
Who is Huch ? Is he a an FBI agent?
🔥💯😎...
I fking loved this movie. Non stop , no nonsense , straight to the point action packed movie. 💯 🔥 amazing. Remember John wick and his dog? Don’t mess with his kitty cat bracelet.
what is the song name?
Give me the goddam Kitty cat bracelet!!!😂
Awesomeness
Having seen this movie, there is one thing I have noted - HE maybe a NOBODY, .......................BUUUUUUUT HE makes a TOTAL MESS out of EVERYBODY
Proper blinding film!!, saw it with the Mrs in arra
John Wish
John wick with a family
Oh how I wish this was somewhere in the early life of Saul.
This movie is like a less serious John Wick. Loved it.
The real savage moment🤣
Didn't see the movie yet,so just going from the trailer, it feels like "Family man John Wick meets Taken" the movie. Now call me a pessimist, but i am a bit sceptical. Hopefuly tho, i am wrong and this is a pretty good movie.
I think lokesh kanagaraj remake the movie 🤔 movie name vikram 😌
The best movie 🍿
i dont no y he dont take the trash out the nite b4....makes it dummy proof....ull nvr miss trash day ever again...& the ppl need to elect him major for actually cleaning up the trash....& making the city a safer place....
This movie was fully satisfying. Well done entertaining fun.
ja assisti
A man is no one
Loved it .. Great Casting as well 👌
The Creditor storyline does not make it into the movie.
I’m willing to bet, that he knows a guy that knows a guy
Amazing shit👊👌
Hell yeah!! Can't wait to watch this one!!
That kid's look on her face at 1:36 is priceless
jimmy is fightin good
John and Halt should do a Collab 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
I just watched it. Omg i love it!!
That f*ckin nobody...is John Wick
Zero to 60 in.... I'm about to find the fuck out
بوب صدق او لا تصدق انا محب لك من السعوديه
*_I hope this turns into a trilogy :_* *2021 :* Nobody *2022 :* Somebody *2023 :* Everybody
This movie is just BAD ASS!
Saul what happened
What’s the name of this song at 1:11 (hani haleva) ??
I hope this turns into a trilogy. 2021: Nobody 2022: Somebody 2023: Everybody
i tot it's gonna be john wick. but no. it's jason bourne - amnesia + john wick - wick.
John Wick : Dog Hutch : Kitty Cat Bracelet
My theory? The first part (before he goes John wick) actually happened  and after the robbery everything else is a hallucination. He went into a coma after the Lady actually shot him with the revolver when he tried helping his son.
Good film
Holy fuck
What if movie with john wick, nobody, and the equalizer crossover
i watched this 5 times now this month
I fucking loved it 🔥
FYI, it's a mix of Death Wish and John Wick. Too many of you are too young to know any better and have too limited experience to know this.
A little bit of trolling
Good movie, though highly unlikely.
What has happened to cinema????  Its gets worse every year, and more like average TV shows until eventually, you see people that were not bad as supporting actors in a pretty good TV series, end up starring in a well below average spin off,  where they confirm they're NOT star quality, and much better off as a support actor in a better TV show...  but somehow ends up starring in a well below average, B movie that ends up being shown to an empty cinema, and consequently ends up on netflix pretty quickly... because it was never cinema quality to begin with, and the cast are not cinema material either, particularly Bob, who lets face it, is annoying in small doses at best, and not someone that you want to put up with for 90 mins or more...  He's a 15 mins per hour sort of guy, in a 1 hour TV show, like breaking bad... but nothing more, as he proves once again in this stupid B movie..  Don't wast time or money watching this rubbish in the cinema. I'tll be on netflix in a couple of months, and all the best bits are in the trailer anyway, whatever is not in the trailer isn't worth watching....And you really couldn't even imagine this guy standing up against his granny...  He's no action hero, he's a comedian at best.
You nailed it 😜
Better call him
Anyone else notice that bit of dialogue from the Barber around the 2:05 mark that is not in the movie?  "When you left, you abandoned a certain debt that needs repayment, and your creditor is aware of your resurrection"
That it! Right? Keep the old Nobody in the mail room because he is not good enough to be a Hitman.
He's one badass
I love Saul, but nobody goes to the theaters and everyone is over hollyweird.
Saul Goodman quit law and started a new family far away from what happened in breaking bad and now is a mafia leader
They should build a movie that makes McCall, Wick, Hutch and Mills standing together
I usually don’t comment on movies but I really enjoyed this !! I loved the fights scenes like he was actually getting punched back, it just seemed more realistic than other movies .
Great action movie. Pretty funny to see a thin middle aged white guy with a wig kick ass.
You don't know what this movie has done for me. Thanks nobody. And thank you very much the guy who played him. -David
Finally a great movie after John Wick..hope there will be Nbd 2 and Nbd 3 :))
Assis kommen immer mit messer
Saul goodman sir
Death Sentence or Death Wish ?
Bob Odenkirk is my new action hero!  This time i'll give a thumbs up to Nobody!
The raid, John wick, mr nobody is one of the best action film I've seen.
A: he's fucking nobody B: that's fucking nobody is NOBODY
Almost Taken
Just noticed he has the wexler + mcgill flask 😅
It was Comedic I hoped to see a true badass type film but got another Unrealistic superman bullshit. The story wasn’t even good.
nobody > john wick ... this movie is fun to watch ... i would like to see a second !
Fukn John wick wannabe, mr. white is calling you back. He said it’s not over until he says it’s over
This is probably a spin off of History of Violence , starring Viggo Mortenson.. you need to watch that one..
Nobody=The boogeyman....
"Who are you? " -"Me? I am Creep, I am weirdo.. " (sad).
Went to see in the cinema yesterday but husband and I both really enjoyed it!
I'm i the only one who arrived here after hearing , Nina Simone Don't let me be missunderstood  , and not the opposite ?!  Btw looks Like a film to watch .
Idk why but this gives me John wick vibes or wolverine vibes
Mr Nobody
Maybe they made this because he will make an appearance in jhon wick.
Part 2 pls
I'm not one for action movies or violence but this movie was good af!  Definitely a must see😁
من جاي من تيك توك 🤣🤣
Will Mr. Wick will like to trade life with Mr. Hutch?  |  John Wick, "Absolutely." Me, "Not tactical."
Just watched it. Totally overrated, another typical Hollywood action movie full of unrealistic scenes, punchlines, violence, guns, blood  and car chasing. Zero content. Muricans love this type of garbage.
Without doubt, one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen..
Great movie. the actor for his age he deserve one award
What was back ground song ....fight in train .
Bob Odenkirk is the new Charles Bronson
I watched Back To The Future I-III before this movie. Turns out Christopher Lloyed still got it!!
I feel like with all these movies like John Wick, Nobody etc. Now is the perfect time to do the Professional 2 with Natalie Portman esp now she is jacked up after doing Thor 4. You know she would put the effort into training with weapons and fighting. So as studios like to show women kicking ass, this would be a great way to do it, obviously with a good enough story tho.
NOBODY V.S. Man Of Wrath
I watched this movie and it was good
One of those films when film doesn't live up to how gd the preview was 👎
I'm sure no one noticed the cat on the table eating from a can.
What Saul Goodman did after breaking bad
This trailer doesn’t do the movie service. Incredibly fun action movie, 100% worth a watch.
So this is what happened after artillery Arthur got fired from GNB.
This is one of the worst action movies I saw recently. Overrated by far.
holy shit its saul
What if JOHN WICK and this is in Same universe
How is it that the movies I pass on originally, and that somehow finally get to find their way into my tv turn out to be amazing. This blows John Wick away. Makes that look crap. This movie is great.  If you think this is a John Wick copy, it's NOT. It's the result of someone whom wanted to produce a similar movie 10 times better.
So they just had to give John wick a cousin
Is it only me or it's really a "John Wick" copy.
this is one of the best trailer ever made. I don't know it Naishuller himself put it together, but the music combined with the action is as great as in "Bad Motherfucker" video
Spoiler Alert    This guy is a Boogeyman. they way he kills people its like its in a horror Movie but even Brutal... How did John Wick stop him?
John Wick you have some competition. This was the best movie of 2021 easily. I'm hungry for more.
Ok, that looks really good!!!
Not very original, but you gotta watch it just cuz of the action and the incredible work Bob Odendirk put into this.
Really enjoyed this film
Kickass movie..enjoyed it♥️
The bus scene along was worth it go see it bloody amazing x
Me: Before trailer: "John Wick knockoff" Me: After trailer: purchased from Amazon for $22.96
I thought i had the imagination to create a awesome action scrip...but i could not even come close to this...easily this is the number one action movie since John Wick and the writers that made the one liners are freaking awesome. Thank you for the entertainment i hope you guys clean up at awards time cause you deserve it big time.
Greatest movie 2021
0:41 don Hector?
After all, he continued to practice karate
if you're looking for a sign to watch the  movie THIS IS IT!
Badass movie
Lalo:Now, our t battle will be legendary

If he said his nobody trust him, ask no more.
Nemo
YOOO WINNIPEG MANITOBA ✊✊✊
Great movie. Everyone must watch this movie❤️👌😍
This trailer reminds me a malayalam movie "Varathan"
Whoever put this trailer together is awesome at their job.
This is when you get bored during covid
This is the bootleg John wick
"For 12 years I've been working for bad people" Wife: how did you get out. "I bought a vaccum" Wife: uhh...?
😂 😂 😂 My man Jimmy
This movie is awesome... Guys must watch it...
Is there a cameo for Saul Goodman?
The Old days of John Wick...
seems a character from JohnWick universe.. If John is code boogeyman, this one is the Auditor.. i believed they have codes for each assassins... his kinda neat and simple guy from the outside, same personality with John but dangerous..
Better call Saul
I am getting that equalizer vibe!
A+ plus 10\10 from me i loved it
This movie really bad one of the best
Better call saul 😁
So: a quiet man, until their house is robbed, terrifies them, but does not kill them, it turns out that he was a "cleaner", a killer commissioned by the FBI and CIA, clashes with the Russian mafia, killing the brother of the boss, the boss looks for him with his gang, like 500 men, lures them into a basement, previously prepared, and kills them all, with tools like MacGyver, And finally kills the boss with a Claymore. Stop!!! in the end it's fine !!!  ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Attention ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ . . . . . ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Spoiler alert⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️                …UIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII…
Ok, I'm listening...
The best Bruce Willis or Liam Neeson action movie I have ever seen. Outstanding.
Nobody: Better call Saul
Expect this lot of action because the director is from john wick.
Solomon boi 🤣😂😂
Loved this movie
I just watched ,,,wow
Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet!!!!
I feel like I just watched the entire movie. Ahh trailers nowadays.
So next time you ask someone "who's that" and they say "just a nobody  DON'T LAUGH.
It just shows watch out for the quite ones
Did y'all know Tobey Maguire was in this, as Producer?
At what point are the bad guys going to learn to stop fighting the "good guy" one on one and attack them at the same time??
So when's the sequel coming
I see a john wick universe crossover in the future
-Say my name -you're nobody -You're God damn right
Just watched it would recommend
Loved it
not heard this one before
Was looking forward to this movie, but he had to talk sh*t. Now I'm out. Your an actor, act and shut up. Here is a surprise, you've been canceled.
2:37  ohhhh baby a triple!
it 's odd...hollywood has a LOT of movies of OLD men suddenly living the life of the unsung hero and killing bad people of society low and high in an illegal way, as if there is NO proper rule of law in place. Yet, RL America , and anything (governments)  related to CONTROL of ordinary citizens (that includes Hollywood!) is absolutely zealous into forbidding any citizen to do ANYTHING remotely independent like this .. What a hypocrisy..
i'm happy your relapse
I've never seen a black Russian. I get that a lot. 🤣
Better call Saul season 6 looks like it took an odd turn
Better call Saul season 6 in disguise!
The worst story i’ve ever seen, they kill for no reason and fight for silly reason.. literally its a waste of time 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
😂
The begining was good the end was terrible and so campy I lost interest both watchings. They should have kept it semi real and maybe have Russians look like Russians and not clearly Americans? Llyod was misused and looked silly dodging bullets.
I saw this when it first came out very good, he’s like John Wick but very crazy and story line is great loved it. If you like John wick your like this.
Intense!
I became the fan of the bgm
Hi does anyone know what the song short is between about 1.10 and 1.16 it's got me curious.
Best movie this year do u agree?we are please to see the next chapter of this.

Saul Goodmin other life. looks so good!
So much hype for this movie...it was decent at best
Gotta see this
I didn’t know Saul Goodman was a nobody
AMAZING JUST AMAZING 😁
“You brought a lot of shotguns” “Well, you brought a lot Russians” 😂
I was genuinely surprised to see Christopher Lloyd kicking ass at his age but it was a welcomed surprise.
What is this music . ı couldn't found anywhere 1:11
Best movie for 2021 it made me happy for bottom of my heart it was funny and the action was really good 🎊 9/10
This kinda like John wick but he takes hits instead of block or dodging them, what a fucking legend
Just watched it... 🔥🔥🔥🔥  7.5/10
The only guy who can out pizza the hut, because Nobody out pizzas the hut
Just saw it...bloody amazing!
Who would’ve know Emmett Brown would’ve became the father of an ex government assassin for the CIA
Looks good
This is a real breaking bad movie
Cool
Send John Wick he won't need guns just give him pencil!
Better call Saul
So hey uhm No one here gonna talk about that 3 head collateral headshot?
Wait is this a piss take? I mean that fight scene in the clip looks like dog shit. Let’s take out of consideration the actor who is terribly mis cast but the punches etc? I mean presumably it has to have a minuscule shred of believability no? Please don’t risk covid to go see this flick, it’s looks like utter gash!
Whose wise idea was it to make Saul and action hero? He’s less believable than Liam neeson In taken 😂😂
this reminds me of Michael from GTA V

do you all realize mike sitting in BETTER CALL SAUL
mans really hit the triple head shot XD
"Who are you"       Saul Goodman, attorney at law
I am excited for this one  brilliant story,acting and the trailer done amazing job capturing that.
Looks good, separate from other action films with actors that we already know, I feel like part of the film is already in spoiled, showing that he does got the cat back.  Having not already seen the film I and others would have viewed the film wondering is he going to get the cat back or not.
I love everything Ilya Naishuller does. Amazing!
Sora: Aww crap, I want to go back to fighting heartless
One of the best movies hands down
So for the last year we have had 'Nothing' in the cinema and now we have 'Nobody'
Saul became John Wick.
Apparently the best movie of the year
Sual what you doing
It feels like I already watched the entire movie...
THIS MOVIE IS BEYOND 🙌
Only trailer I've seen in the past few years that makes me want to see it!
"I'm out, no need to pay" 😂😂
I hope there's a sequel - bob odenkirk's awesome
Actually a great movie. Amazing.
IT'S BEEN HELL OF THE DAY  I CAN SEE THAT....
Better call nobody  To help you
Bob odinkirk is the greatest. Only $20 movie I’d buy. Love this guy

Waiting For This:
Falling Down for the 2020's :D
“Don’t call 911 . Better call Saul”
This is just John wick but instead of a dog he has a family
I want Bob to be the next James bond
Total garbage. Nonsensical. Daft. No script.
dont call the police call saul goodman
Like a modern day "Falling down" meets "John Wick".
What's the music ?
Great movie 👍🏻 The songs, the story and the acting are dope 👏🏻
I really dont know how this is possible but i saw  half of the movie already like 1 month ago what the actual f ???
Mr Wick used ""a f.cking pencil", Mr Nobody uses .. Whatever..!
I'll BBQ and invite a few friends and on the 65" will be John Wick 1,2&3, Peppermint, Nobody & Hardcore Harry💥💯👍🏿
I see Saul's been taking self-defense lessons from Mike.
Eh
This is essentially John Wick, but with a plot and good acting
I'm nobody.. That guy is definitely somebody
If i would've guest that is John Wick if he gets older
That Nobody is John Wick's dad.
his old man dad. is cute. haha hes laughing and enjoyed killing pwople
വേറെ  ലെവൽ item !! 🤩🤩
I'm really glad Universal is finally making lots of good action movies
shit was fire i assume it be aight
Bob here gives off big Bruce Willis vibes
Great, now I've watched that I don't need to see the movie.
Saul wick! 😂😂
"Who tf are you?"      It's saul good man.
Do you have a basement
overhyped
Malayalees evide???👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Lady - ‘ Who the f*** are you ?’ Nobody - A laugh riot  !
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯  For this movie cause I just watch it 😂😂😂 100% great 👍 👌 🍸😎
Rehearsal for jhon fucking wick❤️
Action satisfaction !
Never saw this trailer, did see the movie though. Its damn good, pbb the best movie this year so far dont know if it can stand up to F9 tho. I really recommend this one and hope we’ll get a sequel.
I only watched the first 20 seconds of this trailer and thought the movie would go wildy different. I was pleasantly suprised though
Mr Nodody ain't nothing to fuck with !  I'm here for RZA
Name of the Indian song?????
Best movie  of the year
Great actor, but wrongly cast for this role. Doesn't make the character believable.
Wow a new action star! Breaking bad was a good show. This looks like a very entertaining film.
awsome movie...
I love Bob Odenkirk so damn much. I remember him from Mr.Show but also know he's a super nerd because I saw an interview with him where he suddenly perked up and and spouted off on the virtues of James Joyce and had to fight to control himself and I felt like he's a kindred spirit (I'm an English teacher) I'm so so so glad he's getting more famous and I know I'm armchair psychoanalyzing but he's always seemed to have a chip on his shoulder....I hope he's happy with how things are going.
Saul Wick...  John Goodman 😁
sometime he look like he's animated
Great movie. Odenkirk is a great actor. He has won me over.
And the Oscars goes to ......
This movie is so _Incredible_
Bullshit movie
What was the whole bit about the creditor because I swear that wasn’t in the movie! Obviously will help create a sequel though!
Just watched this film, its fecking awesome!!!!!! Very well done!!
So no one else noticed the quality of music played in the movie?
Wow saul is looking a bit hardened up now lol
The best part is who is calling and what someone said on the phone in the interrogation room...?
*This movie is fucking awesome dope*
Ha! Looks great. Saul gets some balls.
Hansel is basically an American Cha Tae-Sik
more like if John Wick's wife didn't die
The cheerful “toot” from the rubbish lorry.....I laughed out loud for the only time today. Cheers.🦊
Thought it was John wick 4
Fun fact, this is the story of mr. Nobody of fast and furious franchise,
Nobody better call Saul
Can’t wait for this
Have seen a good movie after a long time
gostei bastante
Superb movie ✌️✌️
silly movie
Brilliant actor can’t wait to see the film
The comment here are so funny, Why the hell you comparing this movie in John wick, this is not marvel shit hahaha
I just watched it. This movie is ultra-violent.
John wicks cousin
John Wick 4? Loll
@1:12 the song anyone?
It remind me of john wick
Dude will need a damn good lawyer. Worlds second best, at least
Lets just say I know a guy, who knows a guy... Who knows another guy
Absolutely savage😎OMG that was awesome 👏🏻 Especially the savage grandpa😁 If you’re a fan of action thriller then don’t miss it guys. I’m 10000% sure you’re gonna love this movie.
The only fact behind watching the trailer again after the movie is that I didn't have enough of that Great Movie.
I really really really liked this movie. Better than trailer .Better than some other action movies
Where the fudge is the kitty cat bracelet! LMAO
John wick just met his nemesis
Like Chuck said, Jimmy can never help it
better call saul alternate timeline be like
Liam neeson lite

0:59  I'm gonna f**k U up  And they laughed at him, thinking he was Saul Goodman...  Oh.... Big  m i s t a k e
Can't wait for part 2
Older baba yaga  😎
Ah yes,So John Wick but with a comedic side to it. got it.
This movie is proof that u can have two movies with basicaly same idea (John wick and Nobody) and still make them both uniquie
I just watched it...and it was AWESOME🤙👏
That grenade wtf? Its homemade on the movie
Better Break John Wick, Saul
Damn, will definitely watch it.
So uhhh.. the guy who directed this movie also directed Hardcore Henry, just letting everyone know..
Me I am NOBODY
Taken + the equalizer + rambo5 +John wick = Nobody 😁👍
Everytime he says his story everybody dies🤣🤣👌👌
Why did the wife kept reminding him that he forgot to take out the trash 🤦‍♂️🙅‍♂️🤦‍♂️
If Saul played Heisenberg
This is the moment Saul Goodman became Nobody.
oooooh heckv yeah
Nobody is amazing movie but I feel like it could have had just liiitle bit more coordination in fight scenes. Just a little bit. Like the car chase scene is amazing but the other fighting not so mutch. If they wanted to make it more like real fight tho its completely ok.
Russian John Krasinski 0:54
After killing the baddies: I'm just a - low key humble brag soft flexin - nobody
Don't call 911 coz I'm better  than 911 lmao

So I guess Saul learnt his lesson from Jesse and took up his karate class he was always talking about well done Saul
fett dab
Nearly went insane. I really love this movieeeee !
he was the one you sent to kill the boogeyman-u r watching the story of the boogeyman
Too little to late i already watch the Triller‼😅
I hate trailers that give away the whole damn film. Leave SOMETHING to the imagination please. Why write twists into films just to show them in the first 30 seconds here? Losers
Just watched it. Fucking loved it👏🏽👏🏽🔥 since now a days it’s mostly superhero movies it’s refreshing to see a cool badass action movie

Better call nobody
An outclass movie indeed.wwaiting fo part 2 against,cissilian mafia probably
F*ckin Love this movie
Looks great. I'm glad the director of Hardcore Henry is still doing movies.  Hardcore Henry is great.
This movie gave me “Breaking Bad” vibes really good movie
best movie of the year so far .... really enjoyed it
'You should see the other guys'  Well.... he wasn't kidding
Where can I watch it?
does anyone think his face resembles eli wallach ?
I dont care how good this movie is but john wick is still better.
This movie needs to win an award for best movie of the year hands down. My family love this movie especially my pop. Great cast i hope to see them do a couple more of this movies in the future turn it into a sequel
Film apike ora patut, ceritane wong biasa bae, tapi masa lalune ora karuan bar bar e

it's Saul Goodman...!
I didn't know the kid from Home alone became a government assassin
The best action heroes are in their 50s. I wonder why.
"Who the f*ck are you?" "Me? I'm...  Jimmy McGill".
I would love to see him work with John Wick.
New edition of john wick
Ok. Trailer told the whole movie. Spoiler alert
Badass movie 🔥 Die hard and john wick vibe
Just watched. Simply gun wrenching
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"The f*cking nobkdy is John Wick"
Don't call 911🔥
Is this good movie or not??
Does anyone know the music coming at 1:12??
The untold story of Jimmy McGill
Watch this movie out of curiosity, now I love this movie. Kudos 🍿
Her: What is happening? Him: Don't call 911      Me: She BETTER CALL SAUL 😂
This movie and Wrath of Man are my two favorite movies so far this year, hope to get more of these types of movies
Saul Season 6 BCS
Obvious Slippin Jimmy fooling everyone including his family
Just got done watching this movie. And now I have to collect it into one of my favorites
I'm here just to say: that movie is brilliant ! Action movie of the year I love it, funny with good music. Grandpa was my fav part, what a champ (got back from the future flashbacks but here he got ballz of steel) 🔥🔥💪
John Wick + Home Alone
Al Bundy + John Wick = Nobody! Loved it!!!
So Saul Goodman isn't a Goodman.
Idc about the story ,bob odenkirk is there in it ,Imma watch it. Daayuumm lovee youu saull❤️
Dont coll 911 😂😂
The ONLY reason this movie didnt do as well as it should have is because of the timing it was released. If it was released pre or post pandemic it would of done just as well or better than John Wick.
STUDIO EXECS: "LET'S MAKE A HELL OF A MOVIE"  :NOBODY
Nobody's perfect.
Looks like the copy of John wick
John Wick in an alternate universe
The new Die Hard hero. "Down but not out unassuming everyday normal man kinda hero."
"Don't call 911" they're in on it
Nice to see that Saul has finally gotten his life together.
"I worked for some very dangerous people" One of the few guys who worked for Walt White and got away "harmless"
NICE!!!!!!!!!!!
better call saul become a bad ass !! woow n he looks like he lost many weights too
I like his pap
another inspiration and testament to what you can achieve through vigilante justice, especially today when those who are SUPPOSED to protect us all kneel to the woke mob.  when the SYSTEM fails, you BECOME the system.
When I first saw the trailer I thought it would be a sequel оf Better call Saul
it would be very cool if it was a sequel to ,,Better call Saul !!!
Best movie I have seen in a long time
Errrrr so let's get this right - filmed partly in Canada (where guns are pretty much banned) a Hollywood / California film where the drones of woke gun bans are deafening, Errrr a film full of guns and violence? Isn't there some kind of disconnect?
John Wick with a family
Bob Odenkirk is a badass!
This movie did not disappoint at all
Saul
Name cigarette ?
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!"
Amazing movie. check out wrath of a man also good
Seems oddly similar to The Equalizer.
That's too much for a trailer I guess.
Done watching.very nice
Not a single moment i turned my head
Nobody prequel starred by Chris Evans 👍😂
تبا كم هو جميل ان تشاهد افلام اسطوريه هكذا
" that nobody is......"   "John wick"
actual dogdoo doo, would not recomend.
Better than Wrath of Man
Don't watch the trailer....go directly to the movie... you'll love it..
0:23-0:46
Just watched it after wrath of man and this movie was way better !!
this is the best movie ever
Best movie I've seen since 2012
This is how John Wick & Robert McCall would look like with a family.
Awesome!
The look on his daughter's face as he's placing his family in the basement is priceless.
thumbs up... i so love this!!!!
I watched that last night its so good
just ... give him the goddamn kitty cat bracelet

This is the moment Jimmy McGill became the Boogeyman
If Saul Goodman didn't get the law degree and stayed as "Slippin' Jimmy"
'I'm out, no need to pay, good luck'. 😂😂💀💀
Actually he is the bogeyman which john wick ( babayaga ) was sent to kill
When there is " Nobody " to call " You Better Call Saul "
I guess i better call Saul!

They took your daughter's kitty cat bracelet?  BETTER CALL SAUL.  actually 'nobody, does it better' makes sense now. 😂😂😂
i can never bring myself to watch saul goodman act an action movie. let him go back to our better call saul series in peace.
Really good movie . John wick meets retirement
Wow this trailer just walked you through the whole movie. I think you would enjoy the movie more without watching this trailer. Its a great one.
Music damn good
I am actually going to watch this movie, Dreamworks reaching out to Ted Nivison to recreate two scenes was great marketing!
Who tf disliked the trailer? I hope this guy comes for ur ass.....
Please tell me I wasn’t the only one that thought the man in the movie poster was Kevin Costner 🤯🤯🤯
best [action (?) ] movie of the year...no doubt. Just finished watching it and this is how an action movie is supposed to be! Every detail in the movie was well thought out, just the right amount of comedy, right amount of tension, right amount of love, right amount of head shots...action movie of the year for sure! A sequel is necessary...please haha!
What a satisfying hell of a moviee. Loved it🥰🥰🤪🤪
This would make a good Christmas movie
Saul Goodman after dealing with the Mexican Cartels lol
Glad I didn't see the trailer first.
Does this house have a ……”BASEMENT” 😂😂
John wick copy film 😂😂😂
I smell a franchise 🔥🔥 dope ass movie
Bob Odenkirk is so underrated. Loved him in this! The opening scene where he is handcuffed, lights a cigarette, pulls out a can of tuna, opens it with a can opener from his other pocket and then pulls a kitten from his jacket and gives him the tuna during his interrogation was magnificent.
Think about a team (consist of) 1. Riley (peppermint)  2.Robert (Equalizer) 3.Rambo  4.John wick  5.bryan mills (Taken)  6.Hutch (nobody)
This is the exactly moment when Saul Goodman become Mike
the best movie in 2021
Haven't watch yet, definitely sure you wont be disappointed, even better if you watch blind, because its thrilled.
BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!
I just can't see Saul as a badass. Sorry.
Damn Saul Goodman got some skills , great movie !
This movie is NEXT LVL of absurd.
Rehashed John Wick?
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET!
Amazing movie 🍿
John Wick if he's a family man.
oh yeah this totally makes sense, now I know where artillery Arthur got his name lol
So simple yet literally an incredible movie man 😩🤌
this was a good fucking movie, genuinely entertaining  however if a sequel is made they should call it “2-Much of a Nobody”.
Awesome movie
better call saul  the action version ahaha
I spent $20 to watch this on Amazon Prime.   And I would've spent $30.  No one thought Bruce Willis was going to pull off John McClain in Die Hard because he wasn't enough like Schwarzenegger or Stallone.  But he made an everyman into a hero.   Same goes here.  Nobody saves the day.   It's not cinema.   It's fun.   So sit back and enjoy it.   😉
Waste of time as I’ve seen this movie 100 times before. He kills 1000 bad guys and becomes a hero.
John Wick and Hutch should go to anger management classes together.
meh.. still like jhon wick
The fu¢king" Nobody" is John Wick
Easily the best movie of the year.😆😆😆
Loved it, great movie and great soundtrack
Where can I watch this
in other words john wick...
Damn Saul got tough
The song in the trailer, anyone know it?
BUDGET JOHN WICK

Why are gun sounds so low.
Damn that grandpa is Badass
*Does it better*
NOBODY DOES IT BETTER
മലയാളി ഉണ്ട്
I watched all of John Wick films and I was truly disappointed. This film right here, Nobody was the John Wick I expected, it was much better.
One of the best movies I've ever seen
Would be a Killer movie.
Damn Saul
every trailer is like you watched the whole movie.
This is just a worse version the equalizer... Funny movie do
if Saul is now an action hero im nelly the elephant ,he must given all the meth made by hiesenberg to Universal pictures . Anybody likes this is definitely a Republican
Movie for people whit IQ of 30, no more :)
Who was the actor who played the cat and also does he/she have any other cat roles in future movies
We want john wick nobody crossover
this movie is hilarious !!! 9/10 !!!
I would love to see john wick vs Mr nobody.
What a fucking film 🎥
Walt: "We're done when I say we're done..." Saul: Say "we're done" Walt: What? Saul: ... Say it! Walt: Alright, alright... we're done 😶👍
i wanna se No body 2😍😍😍😍😍
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF 2021.
I love me some Odenkirk!      I'm gonna fukyouup!  Sounds like.....me.   Don't take that KittyKat bracelette!
Worth watching!really nice!
Damn good movie 🍿
Awesome 😊👍
This movie is like John Wick meets Home Alone :DD
20 May 2021

"That Foking Nobody is jhon wick"
One word brilliant!
Batman n Robin? Wick n Nobody f me!
Good movies r rare these days
The first film of this director is “hardcore”. Amazing movie!
Bru watch a movie coming out in 2025 called “John Wick vs. Nobody”
better brawl, saul
hope there is a part 2... just "nice"
Jimmy my boy
Can anyone tell me the background music, during the bus fight in the trailer I really liked that song.........  Anyone.........
1:06
2:44
nobody > john wick
"Dont call 911"  Neighbour: "Noise complaint".
Who? That f**king nobody? That f**kin’ nobody is John Wick
even surpassed my already quite high expectations. Fucking loved it.
I  want him vs wick..
this came as a bonus- Thanks John Wick!
Ralo Salamanca is in a big trouble now
If you havent seen this film yet... you are missing out big time... I didnt expect such a masterpiece... its an original idea thats for sure... and the cast kill it.. loved doc from back the future as the gran dad he was a bad ass.
God damn. Better not call Saul lmao
hehe
Holy Shit Christopher Loyd!
This is basically the better version of john wick
Pure undiluted action! Loved it!
Finally i know why he's called artillery arthur
Johnwick is same universe with nobody?

John Wick's Cousin.
1:12 അയ്യപ്പനും കോശിയും
John wick would maul him
nobody nobody does it better
It's Saul Goodman everybody
Its like seeing john wick getting old hahaha
1:33 don't call 911, better call saul
Bob Odenkirk is such an underrated actor
so this is what became of saul's new identity
It's like Indian action movies
Seems like Jhon Wick without a dog?
This trailer is short movie of the real movie.. spoiler trailer..
I think every hot-blooded American has a little bit of this inside
This part was supposed to belong to Clark Gregg I just feel that
Now I know why such movies get a high score. it's the nature of the westerns as most of them are violent.
After Kim he did well but broke bad after all
ooo man they way this movie starts i just awesome! first the kitten and then his daily routine xD
Excellent movie!
Malayalizz ondodey
Saw this yesterday, and it's now one of my favorite movies
The best loved it
Where I can watch this movie
👌👌👌🌟🌟🌟
i swear this  movie is sooogood i just watched  omg
What is the music in the background ? Help, please.
This is the moment jimmy became nobody
The puffy corn inadvertently introduce because trousers generally multiply despite a onerous waiter. oval, untidy comma
Nice this video
2:48 Im the danger
The way he fights like a John Wick movie...Really loved it...
Fun movie, i really enjoyed it.
Fake dubb h iski ek dm bekar
this movie is hands down the best action movie of 2021.
Nobody thinks this movie is good.
If you saw the first John Wick movie you already saw this one, don't waste your time, it is an exact copy.
“From the Director of Hardcore Henry”  FUCCKK YEAHHH!!!
This was a great movie.
This is a Jaw dropping movie!
This is a mix of The Equalizer and John Wick ... 👍
We need a sequel! 🔥🔥🔥
Top movie, a very pleasant surprise. its one movie not to miss, loved every minute of it and Christopher Lloyd was the icing on the cake.
F**KING brilliant film! Almost like a bastardisation of John Wick blended with JOKER hehe
film about me in future :==
Didnt knew john wick had a cousin named hutch until this movie.
This movie is about terryfying protagonist hunting down those bad guys, this movie is so good idk if Saul is so badass lol
Another movie inspired by the movie "John Wick."
"Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet"😭😭 I NEED TO SEE THIS
THIS FILM IS AMAZING
Fuck it...downloading torrent.....😎😎😎
Dope movie. I continue to be impressed with Bob Odenkirks acting ability.  From  an arms enthusiast and dealer I appreciated the supressors sound representation. I found it comical that when he was describing the gun at one point as a HK USP 45 the USP very obviously showed 9mmx19 on the slide
john wick copy
ohhhhh this is amazing!!!
when saul goodman breaks bad
what is the soundtrack used in this trailer during the bus fight scene? In places its listed as "Just a Gigolo & I Ain't Go Nobody” by Louis Prima" but there is no way that song could be it
"Thanks for your service"
When John wick is trying to start a family
Loved this movie 🎥 side by side with the (Wrath of Man.) with Jason S.  Best movies of the Covid Year
Most rawwest action-packed movie of the year all the way around (hands down) absolutely can't wait for part 2 to go down..
When You..  Walk Through The Storm Held Your Head Up High!
Hutch:Dad you bring a lot of shotguns  Grandpa: you bring a lot of russians
Don't call 911? Don't call John Wick Don't call John McClane Don't call John Rambo . . . Better Call Saul!👉🏻
moviee💥🔥
Damn good movie!
I enjoyed "Nobody" First time back at the movies in over 1 Year.....My son  thought it was to unreal....But movies are make believe . I say Go See This one .
Another UNDERRATED MOVIE of 2021
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now everytime i have lasagna ,, i will watch my front window !!!!
Jay plays
Hutch is just John Wick in another part of the multiverse
I loved this watching again n again
Awesome movie
LOVED this movie, it was fantastic!!
Well... I saw the full movie on the trailer.. thank you.
First thing that came into my mind after seeing this is jhon wick
Best film of the year so far.
It's all good man.
"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!" I love that line
Everybody wants to watch Nobody!😁
I love it
I haven't watched a movie like this for a long time! what a masterpiece!
The soundtrack is off the hook
1:12 I need this song
Form me still the punisher best revenge movie
MOVIE OF THE YEAR, definitely has my vote.....
Walter White wouldn't mess with this version of Saul Goodman.
What song is this ?
Go and watch it it's so good 🤤
A more enjoyable john wick 🔥
Me and my brother just watch this even we don't know the movie and we didn't regret it.
Just watched it and the movie is really good especially on the last part
Favorite movie of the year
So this is the "boogeyman" john wick killed with a pencil..."a fuckn pencil"!
The revenge of Saul.
Hope it’s a part 2
I was lucky to watch this before seeing trailer. So many spoilers
I loved the part where he gets in the car after telling the Russian that they can end this now or finish it and just crosses his fingers hoping that he wants to finish it!
A kitty cat bracelet start it all...
Very nice.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Haha fúnny, whats up with you old man, im gonna fuck you up hahaha
Overhyped crap..stopped watching halfway
Bintang 5 untung Film ini.
Im Batman!
Best film I've seem for YEARS, without fail.
his talking style also kinda match with john wick😐
Spoiler alert:            The phone call at the end was for a new dust for his Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro model 60.
Sul just became John Wick.
Man even got a triple collat at 2:36
The punisher + john wick =
This movie is so good !!
The triple kill was glorious.
Such a great movie!
seen this movie, they even used the same background music from john wick , which is cool.
Best season of better call saul ever 👏
I love how deep down he wants everything in this movie to happen.
Julian:- I'm bad. Hutch:- I'm baddest. Pa:- hold my shotgun.

The movie "nobody" in the UK went to see because we can't. Excellent job Universal. Streaming exists you know.
Both the girl and the tattoo guy saw John Wick and "make like a tree and get outta here!"  - thank you! thank you!
"That fucking Nobody is..."  Sorry wrong movies
So old to fight
Where i can find this film
Great movie🔥🔥🔥
he ain't a lawyer now
I'd give this movie a 5 out of 10 cause I thought this movie would be like jhon Wick but I really wasn't well although this is a good movie but the actions are pretty slow
Father of John wick.... 😂😂😂🤣🤣
This is exactly what would be the episode of Malcolm in the middle where Hal becomes insecure and look for fights non stop if it was a movie
"I'm gonna fuck you up"
It's pretty bad...I love "Saul", but this movie is really bad.
its all good man.
DID THIS HOUSE HAVE A BASEMENT 😆😆😆😆
Is this worth watching?
Trouble ?  Better call saul.
Great show, definitely worth watching 👍

10/10 GREAT MOVIE!! Worth the $20! #Encore
Ultra stupid movie, the american average viewers still wet there pants from joy while watching an ex american spec op taking down the whole russian mafia.
*give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet*
Don’t listen to any of those critic lesbians about bla bla “subtlety” or bla bla “brutish”. This is a fucking beast of a film and you will have a ball.
This was one heck of a movie!!!! I loved it!!
Bhavani......
Watched this movie and it was really really good
And dont forget to “YOU BETTER CALL SAUL” 👍🏻  (BB)
Nobody nobody that this batter
The foooking nobody is John... John wick💪💪💪👍
John Wick vs. Nobody... Someone has to win. Yeah, I know, I'm a genious.
It's amazing how our civilization pumps out endless movies so people can fantasize about being powerful rather than trapped in meaningless jobs. These movies are escape drugs for normies.
"You, uh..working again Hutch?"  "Nah, just sorting things out."
I actually loved this movie
It started coz of the stolen kitty cat bracelet, which turns out was not stolen!!  Crazy movie!!  👏👏👏👏😂😂🔥
Jason Statham, Bruce Willis and Liam Neeson are nobody in compare to NOBODY!
I've got a BIG problem after watching this movie. Ever since I have not been able to get that russian song Bukhaltar the Russian boss was on the stage dancing to OUT OF MY HEAD. I dont even speak russian, or remember the name of that russian boss in the movie, yet I can remember every word of that russian song , even though I have NO idea what the words mean!

Very good movie
I solved it  Hutch killed all the Russian mafia but in John wick we were told that the Russian mafia who johnn worked for have wick a task no man could do, so maybe John was told to kill hutch 😱😱
👏🏼this👏🏼movie👏🏼is👏🏼awesome👏🏼
Who’s here cuz AD 😂
Did not expect it to be that good tbh great movie

I used to love John wick 👊
John Wick motivations: Puppy Hutch Mansell: Kitty bracelet
I definitely want to go to this  one .big theater and  big sound!!
After watching the movie (which I loved by the way), the trailer gives away so much of it! You’re better off going into this without any expectations. Incredible acting from Bob and entertaining from start to finish! That bus scene is incredible 👏🏼
We 👏🏼need 👏🏼 a 👏🏼 crossover 👏🏼 with 👏🏼 John Wick 👏🏼
What's that song that comes right after he fucks them up
Trans people *triggered*
Just watched it, and it was fucking awesome!
better call saul xD
This movie is amazing
really loved it!
Can't wait to see it
while he fights the guys in the bus, what music is being played in the background
Best movie in years!!!! Love it! Good work peeps! More in this manner ♥
He is good at fighting
Hu 😡🤬😤🙎‍♂️😠😠😾
Without spoilers  nobody in a nutshell.. A man going berserk after two couples stole his daughter's kitty cat bracelets
One of the best films so far this year, very entertaining!!!
Toxic masculinity at it's finest.
Inspired from John Wick I guess 🤣
Nice movie..
0:28 He's sporting a Wexler & McGill cup
"You know, I tried this retirement thing".
I really love this movie 👍👍👍
I loveeeeeed this move !!!!! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND 💯💯💯💯
What a movie . Highly recommended to watched this precious movie.  Guys
So the plot of this movie is, a highly trained assassin makes a public mistake, and some bad guy took it personal finding out that he’s alive. Seems like a pretty weak story. It’s like if I promised the mailman I’d give him a sandwich, and after 6 years of the guy not needing a sandwich, I forget about it, then he decides to stop delivering my mail. I was hooked because Saul Goodman was breaking faces, but this is a little below the belt. I do have a brain, put more effort into directing next time.
hey guys is this good
These kinda movies are played out lol
one persone can do all this coooooooooooome on !!!!!!!!!!
trop nuuuuuuuuuuuule
The Dog  The Cat
The Bus fight scene was the best , unbelievable and badass😃
Bring them together already...         We need crossovers                    Nobody                 John Wick               The Equalizer
This movie was horrible!!!!!
Alternative ending: he gets arrested for murdering some minors on a bus
Love this movie. I watched it 8 times,😁
Jerry
Brian Harkey
action scenes are just 🔥🔥🔥
Nobody was hidden by John wick faked his death to complete the task he can disappear people just like sofia daughter John will ask nobody for a favour in future
My fiancée and I went to the theater for the first time in over a year....picked this movie and we were not disappointed. Well written, superb performances and one hell of an entertaining movie. Highly recommend. After playing Saul, wasn’t sure if I’d believe Bob would be believable in this role but he was perfect
A MUST WATCH! A REALLY GREAT MOVIE if you liked John Wick. And everybody, everybody liked John Wick. So... you know "The Equalizer"? This is a mix of the 2. LOVED!
Plot twist: This is a sequel to better call Saul

Hmm. "I never expected to see Joey again." Do people have short memories or is it OK to reproduce basically the exact same movie every few years? Don't get me wrong, I loved A History of Violence and will probably love this, but the sense of deja vu watching the trailer was a little distracting.
For fak sake...i loved the movie. But trailers just give wholle movie up
00:29 wexler mcgill worked out eh
I knew it was about the babayaga
MUST WATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only theatres 🤬
I liked a lot . Good cinematography
Honestly one of the most satisfying movies i have ever seen
Can anybody tell me who hutch really is in this movie ? I'm so pumped up after watching the movie and i'm here in youtube comments searching for an answer lol
So i guess A guy who knows a guy who knows a guy taught him how to fight...
Please stream to Netflix
Lit movie, worth my time

Bad ass  movie
You wasted my time, I am fasting or I will say bad words about your movie...It is copy paste from the movie called "the equalizer", so don't waste your time guys.
Bad ass Saul
Really loved it 😍🔥
total piece of shit. Ripoff plot, lazy 'acting'... don't waste your time on this tripe.
Glad that I didn't watch this trailer before I watched the movie.
Great movie 👍

Wow, Captain Nobody has grown up eh?
John wick: Slaughter a powerful organization cause his dog died. Hutch: Massacre an entire Russian mafia cause his daughter bracelet is missing.
This is actually an alternate reality where John Wicks wife overcomes cancer and his dog doesn’t get killed
holy shit this movie is great! loved the John Wick vibes.
Baru nonton tadi, filmnya joss
HI NOBODY, IM DAD
VITKO MUSIC Clearly this movie will be a hit..  I would guess without spoiler alerts its going to be Jims style  Equalizer with Washington...  in a clumsy and twisted way!  Could be wrong.   I am a fan of breaking bad, chernobyl, and Jimmy the lawyer.   Now he is back... This time he is with a gun...  This is ©©©© vitko music comment...
Better call Saul!!!
Equalizer, but white.

Average john wick fans  Vs  Average saul enjoyers
They want mf to rents this for $20 on Amazon.
If the writer of the John wick series wrote this movie and filmed by universal studios then this film should be really good to watch.
Don't call 911. *BETTER CAUL SAUL!!!*
Rober: Nobody move! Guy named Nobody:
If you wanna see Edwin Sarkissian's grandfather watch it.
Just came here after the movie. There's hell of a Boogeyman in it.
This trailer make me subscribe to UNIVERSAL.
Anyone else think a cameo by David Lee Roth in the movie would’ve been fun?
“Don’t call 911... I don’t want them to see me committing total massacre...”
First movie I saw in a theatre after a year+ of not going to theatres. I was a great first movie to return to.
How many more shite like this r they going to make. Same thing different actor slightly different story. Boring
Soon hope we can see john wick and nobody in the same movie.
It’s like every standard action movie trailer
Now a day like this movie are hard to find... Nice One
He at the start of the movie: Call an ambulance, Call an ambulance He at the end: But not for me
Jhon wick işine bak kardeşim
A very good movie, would recommend
Tattoo on hutch's wrist could be something connecting nobody to john wick universe
He caused so much devastation for only one kitty cat bracelet! DAMN🔥
He's more dangerous than john wick, would do anything over kitty cat bracelet!!!
wow <3
Russian John Wick
Yeah, Bob!
The one thing I've learned from watching this kind of movies is don't steal anything, even if it's a fucking kitty cat bracelet.
The Russian villain in this movie is totally absurdly ridiculous. Shame on the screenplay writer and director for letting this reach a screen .. Oh and cudo's to Bob for his acting.
Saw this today and it was way better than John Wick.
2:45 who the fk are you? Me? Im John Wick.
John Wick, The Equalizer Macauley Culkin "Home Alone" Style.
Awesome movie
Watched it last night. Great movie
He is a Good Man you can tell for sure.
Saul goodman after breaking bad
"I once saw him kill a man with a teapot... a *fuckin* teapot..."
I've seen the movie. What a crap! The trailer is good, the movie is garbage. Senseless, meaninglessness, stupid. Another batman in the flash, dodging bullets, nothing else. Even Russian mafia is more reasonable than these Hollywood morons imagine it is.
waiting part 2
This movie was so awesome
So they had to use a spanish speaking couple that broke into his house. Instead, why don't you use a typical anglo or Israeli looking couple. Using a Spanish couple is lame.
Nobody .. that's the name of the movie " pitch meeting "
The movie was awesome but it was a bit odd, he put himself in a dire situation for nostalgia sake? I get that the John Wick revenge motif has been done a million times but the revenge is warranted, Yeah he did it for his dog but in this flick, he was doing for fun. Anyway, aside from that, its awesome.
A sequel to this movie would be called “Somebody”
When I hear Bob's voice this comes to my head "Better call Saul" 😂😂
Abe Vigoda ftw
Bob Odenkirk playing Hutch Mansell is awesome. Connie Nielsen playing Becca Mansell is underutilized but in every second she is on screen, she is purely brilliant.  Rotten Tomatoes 83% / 94% and IMDB 7.4 ☆
I'll take this as a life of John wick if nobody appeared to kill his dog and he has a family
If you've seen this trailer, you've seen the movie ;)
How was this not bryan callen movie roll
so tired of these same old "action" movies like come on ... sees a tatoo, kills everyone the end DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
Man if ever an old man says to you that he's gonna fuck you up, believe him or you'll face the consequences.
Man this is the best movie in 2021 that I've watched so far
I was saying this feels very John Wick-ish... same producer. Not complaining tho
Masih belum Move on dari Film ini.. Keren.. Mantapp
This movie deserves part 2 😁
this is such an enjoyable film go watch it guys💯💯💯💯💯💯💯

This is awesome movie. I just watch it. Amazing 9/10
this is supposed to be Liam Nesson's movie lol
fact did you know the last guy called him on the phone is John Wick asking for help
for 12 years he worked for cartel. seems like lalo is coming for revenge
Good flick, if you're watching this to decide if you wanna go see it... do it!
The soundtrack is so good of this movie
At first i was like, bruh this is John Wick with a family but the movie was really good. It was interesting to see Bob Odenkirk as a bad ass as he's always been a bit of a comedic actor but it seems Better Call Saul led him to roles like this.  I'm happy for him and he knocked it out of the park.  Fun movie, I really enjoyed it.
Underrated actor
Villain :it is not happened to you brother. Its who did it to you.  Brother:who? that f***ing nobody Villain:that f***ing nobody     Is nobody

This was filmed in my hometown 👌🏻👌🏻
Watched this tonight. Sooooo good!!!
They must have killed tugboat 🤣🤣
This is a good movie! Enjoyed it very much
Did the producers off John Wick did this movie? It was BadAssssss 👍
Great movie!!
I want that as a serie
ted nivison
JUST CALL SAUL
Honestly its good to see Bob Odenkirk getting some screen time on the big screen. Loved the guy in Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad but always felt like his potential was being wasted. Glad to see he was able to break out of his shell.
add bryn and aaron to the story
ted nivison
Saw it...........awesome!
deathwish/the game
That was so freaking cool
David Letiech is a awesome action movie maker!!
Gimme the god damn kitty cat bracelet 😂
Don't call 911   This is the best movie for 2021  Do you agree?
Thought he was Saul Goodman
cant wait for part 2 :D
Just watched the movie, and it has to be the best parody of another film I have ever seen.  **spoilers below, so stop reading if you haven't watched**   The badass killer who goes dormant.  The Russian son who tempts him out of retirement.  The rage-induced rampage he goes on releasing the nerve.  The hair-raising kills he gets from doing what he does best.  The final one-on-one with the Russian father/mob boss.  The peace and tranquility in the end, now happy with a family to call his home.   This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I hope other movies will follow it.
Takeaway : Don't steal some one's kitty cat's bracelet

This movie is worth every cent of the $20 i paid to rent it. There better be a sequel
Apparently it's NOT all good man
He told his family not to call the cops because it would have been a waste of ed’s time

Imagine the crossover be like John : Hutch? Hutch : John? I heard you retired! John : I heard you retired! Hutch : nah, someone took my daughter's kitty cat braclet. John : oh, mine dog was killed.
So that's where John Wick went after he retired the second time...
Should of made the main character Macaulay Culkin and called it  Home Alone 3 : all grown up
Eeeee guys u deserve my like, comment and subscribe at'll👌👍
After John Wick, this is the only movie I preferred watching, and this is just brilliant!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Interesting,  we want this continue!!!
this is the counter part of John Wick in authority side.... big thumbs up....
People, if you liked this you'll love Hardcore Henry, it's from the same director
I WATCH THE MOVIE 100% BADASS
*THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE*
Loved the shotgun shell / mouse trap shooting through the door thing. Who thought that was a good idea? This movie blows.
We need a Nobody part 2
Nope. No possible comparison with Classic jhon wick. Even the enemy in jhon wick is fighting at the level of Mr. Nobody.
Nobody gonna talk about the Dad? 😂😂😂😂😂
Don't fuck with Saul
At the interrogation room.. Music plays as he smoke a cig.  "...I'm just a soul/Saul which intentions is GOOD. "
We need part 2.right away!
Better Call Saul
wait this is the man who knows a man that knows the man
1:12 name of this song please
This is how john wick would look like with a family.
0:30 why is he always shaking that damn bottle

Nobody NEEDS to on the next John Wick movie!!! This is a must
looks like a  Wexler McGill mug he is drinking from.
blows john wick away
Looks like John Wick ft. Kingsman and RED movie
Good fucken job 💀👌🏼
If it's not too late. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this trailer before you watch the movie. Going in with no idea what the movie was about was one of the best movie experiences I've had in YEARS.
SAUL GOT SOME RANGE
Fuck yeah
Watch it,twice,maybe more than that,maybe give us a second and third part or ill go full nobody on ur asses,lol,jk,great movie,for real

This movie is so good
Hutch Mansion mantan pembunuh bayaran
Very very very very similar to john wick ... Story was quite similar only action scenes were good
This story is on my girlfriend's life      My girlfriend is nobody🙂
Don't call 911 this payback is between criminals
Эдакий американский Данила Багров. Клише, в котором одиночка творит условное «добро», уничтожая условное «зло».
Top film. You know how Netflix takes 2, or sometimes 3 popular movies and crams them into one? "Nobody" is like that...but really good. Bob Odenkirk's performance is impressive and I love the cameo from my favourite Doc.
Nobody
When you walk through the storm
Bob Odenkirk lose a little weight and I personally like the way he looks here...  I just watched and it was good, and one thought crossed my mind: GIVE US NOBODY AND JOHN WICK CROSSOVER!!!
Watched this movie. Similar to john wick but they both are incomparable. They both are legit action movies. I cant even say which one is better. John wick is more intense, this one is more humor
My mom said Saul became hot here
This movie is dope

Movie is better than this trailer
I love this movie! The fight scenes were awesome!!!!! I couldn’t sit still during the fight scenes, I hope a part 2 comes out
van hammersly took em to school!
Damn what a movie..every song in it  has elevates the feel of the scene ..freakin fire 🔥🔥
If there’s anything I learned watching this , Red and the John Wick series, it’s that you can never do without a perfectly serviceable basement.
In 1st John wick evils son says" he is afucking nobody" Evil dad: that nobody is John wick.  Ima guessing they meet at some point.
If yall liked this, you should definitely check out " Hardcore Henry " by the same director. One of the best movies in the last decade tbh
A legendary John Wick-style movie 💣💥
Saul Goodman!
Man this will be an ENJOYABLE movie for me, Derek Kolstad will make a GREAT director.
It's Adult Home Alone version
John Wick and this guy need to team up and take down the fucking high table.
I really really want a sequel... 2, 3, 4, 5.... 50😁
Wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥
“SAY MY NAME” “Nobody...” “YOU’RE GODDAMN RIGHT”
Why didn’t he put bin outside on Sunday evening. 😂😂
When you just want to tell a story but they dies before you fukin finish
I decided not to watch the trailer before watching the movie, and boy it was the best decision I've ever made this year. Hope there's a sequel of this
Saul not goodman
there are some mistakes and leaks in this movie. Did you see the rope tied around the waist when the old man shot one of the enemies?
Don't call nine one one!
Let's hope the crossover happens   The Boogeyman vs. ____________  Nobody lol  Why so serious 😈🃏  Wick all the way!!! 💪
from Producer of John Wick, well... no wonder
Good movie...don't listen to the haters be your own critic
2:25 dog→John Wick cat→Nobody
What a movie man, can say better than John Wick
More like an indian movie, no for me it was sooooo bad.
John wick the nobody the next movie
Now imagine if agent 47, john wick, and hutch collab together
I don't think I'll recovery from reading this comment section OPINIONS on this movie.
When jhon wick has a family and a cat not a dog ...double brutal ...recommended movie
I will watch the sequel it better have all the same writers directors it was Perfect. I didn’t see the trailer not knowing I what I was in for. Movie was phenomenal
The guy who calls the police to get Hutch out of trouble is no other than his lawyer, Saul Goodman.
ouff this guy better call Saul
loved it
Absolutely wild that the dude's line about "your creditor is aware of your resurrection" and that shit NEVER COMES UP in the movie. It's literally just Odenkirk picking a fight with the russian mob.
please be a sequal
i have seen this 3 times!!! freaking awesome!!!
*_very good movie_*
It turns out that Hutch Mansell's father is someone from "Back to the future"
John wick: Al fin un oponente digno
Liam Neeson V2.0 right here
MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! Better than monkey fights lizard! That Hospital Chair is best actor!!
I've genuinely not seen this yet, is this like long kiss goodnight?
Hahahah 😂 mg fans of him
..
Saul Wick
This movie is so goddamn good. Watch this fellas.
This movie should be called "Boogeyman"
another boring shallow & generic action movies
This movie was awesome I was drinking a 12-pack of heineken beer and eating a pound of head on shrimps watching this
was'nt he a lawyer ?
The director is Russian Ilya Naishuller
Easily one of the best film this year! Especially the scene inside the bus..hell yeah!!
Even nobody is somebody 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What's the name of the song in the bus scene.?
How is an ex special forces guy so entrenched in daily routine so disorganized he can't remember to put the garbage out the night before pickup week after week?  :P Good movie though.
This is like John wick
Looks like I have seen this story in so many different ways.. John wick the latest.. I thought stunts and VFX shd be used to support the story .. but these days stories are written to fill the gaps left by VFX..
Hutch vs Wick .... Legendary
Good movie 🎥🍿
Mindless action plot🤦🏾‍♂️
We need a movie with hutch, The Equalizer and John Wick
It's all good, man.
Great movie!! Unexpected how good it would be
Do yourself a favor and watch it now
Anybody here from ted nivision
Just seen this movie and literally was the best movie ever
what song is this at https://youtu.be/wZti8QKBWPo?t=73
Imagine this happen in the same universe as john wick
extroverted john wick
I havent watched the movie yet  but it is amazing. rip ante pavelić
It's all good man!
I hope he makes an apearance in John Wick franchise
You better call Saul...
Oombiya padam
Ya it's a bit late but amazing trailer.. I loved it👍
i very like this movie.
Keanu?
Liam Neeson from aliexpress
don't call 911
Two words: Christopher Lloyd
What I learned from this movie.  Never come to your enemy's house to settle your fight.
I'm just gonna say it, don't care how pompous it sounds or how many haters hate on me.  If you liked this movie, you have a significantly below average intelligence.  Rotten tomatoes paid-for sellout reviews tricked me into seeing this trite John Wick clone.  It was agony, and got worse as it went.
It would be awesome if in the post credits scene, John Wick asks him for help to kill the High Table.
Saul Goodman is back in business!
Jason Bourne will still beat his ass . Sorry not sorry
Soal what the hell are you doing 😂  Look badass
I certainly wouldn't've expected Saul Goodman to become this after his "disappearance"
this trailer should've won an oscar...

How many of you came here just to see Saul Goodman?
Nobody Does it better.....😉
John Wick v Nobody

John Wick+Rambo=Nobody
John wick won’t die
So basically....John wick!? Instead he didn't lose anyone and his pet is a cat
Now i know who is the bogeyman that john kill
The old school music with fast pace action is what I love . Odenkirk killed it
Jimmy is really Slippin his mental state in this
Mr Bean for next prequel plz as protagonist 🙏🙏🙏😂😂😂
Saul 😉
No need to watch the movie, they put the whole god damn movie in the trailer.
I love movies like this, but it always makes me mad when they don’t follow up with more films; yet end on a cliffhanger. Lol hope this isn’t one of them. Going to watch it tonight!
After watching it: pile of shite. Americans have lost connection with reality.
Why are americans obsessed with super heroes and vilaines russians?? Grow up
Very good movie was not disappointed!
Good movie
Give me THE GD KITTY KAT BRACELET 🤣😂🤣😂
Don't call 911, Better call Saul.
This came out of nowhere!!! Awesome flick! I’m sitting here like, there’s no way we are getting good movies this year because of the virus. But, holy shit!!!!!!!
Nice movie!  I live in Winnipeg (Canada), the bus fight scene was shot in front of my college :)

kevin mccallister - the later years
Fav film this year tbh, not that theres many others out atm, but this was awesome
Talk about a badass
Humility at it peak . This is the best movie so far in 2021
John Wick's father showed up at last!
Kevin Costner was bad ass in this
Damn!! I just had to watch it two times
Just watched this last night, in the theater...AWESOME! Did anyone else notice his coffee cup?? Wexler and McGil?
Connie Nielsen 😍😍😍😍
combine of john wick and joker (in metro scene )
Brilliant movie🍿.. Just hate the start 🥴#
Did I just see the entire movie?
Normal life  grandpa:  " I'm too old for this, when you turn my age  you'll understand!!!" Nobody's  grandpa: " killing ppl while watching  tv"🤣
He integrated his shadow, from a Jungian perspective.
can you imagine the beginning of "John Wick 4"? Keanu has nowhere to hide so he goes to the only good person he knows: Saul/Hutch!
Fake John wick
Maybe nobody and John wick in one universe
This is John Wick Litter Brother, but no one touch John Wick.
This is literally John wick. But I’m not complaining
this movie is way better than i expected. when i first saw the trailer,i was like this is just ebay jphn wick movie, i mean this movie typically is a john wick but its really good.
i know a guy who knows a guy who knows another john wick.
Loved it! 90 minutes well spent
Hoping for a sequel , i enjoyed this one
I want nobody, nobody but you
This was sooo good !!! Highly recommend to anyone doubting giving it a watch
If his family dies, this is John wick all over again.
WOW..............Saul is a real Bad Ass...............
Gave that movie a try without any expectations, besides thinking it could be good.  Knew Bob Odenkirk from BREAKING BAD.   The beginning was cool. The repetitive days, actions right away set the tone for me. I felt sorry for Hutch already about his miserable life. Something had to give at some point though, lol.   The music in this movie is pretty good. Loved it.  There is lots of action. Shooting, fighting, explosions & blood. The violence is present big time. There is a comedy side also, which is always nice. The story is simple with no big surprises.  Bob Odenkirk gave, imo, a good performance. The rest of the acting, by others, is o.k. no big roles here.  So, I was happily surprised about that movie. Enjoyed it. It was very entertaining to me. Could have watched a bit more.  Thought the movie was short at 1H26. It flows really smoothly.  Could there be a NOBODY #2? Maybe. A big thumbs up from me.
Viggo : Its not what u did thats makes me angry son, its who u did it to. Iosef : Who? The F****ng NO BODY? Viggo : That fking NO BODY.... is John Wick.  i guess the idea of No Body (2021) from this dialogue :D  so we have another John Wick on different universe.
Is the movie as laughable as the trailer?
John Wick is a dog person and Nobody is a cat person.
Saul Goodman , Jimmy McGill , Gene Takovic , Hutch Mansell
Girl: They took my Kitty cat bracelet!!!!! Dad: ooh I'll buy the new one!!! Girl: Then i want boyfriend ...... Every Dad: Give me the God damn Kitty cat bracelet!!!!
John wick is better but i Enjoy it nice movie
oh my fucking awesome lawyer of heisenberg :)
Someone must have forgot to pay him his retainer
This movie is so good, i want part 2
In theaters only?! 🤣
RED/John wick  You bought a lot of shot gun, Dad you bought a lot of Russians 😂
Movie was amazing!
This is the best movie I have ever seen!
Went to rent it on YouTube then it said 19.99$  I said NOBODY gonna charge me that much for a rental. 🤣
हिंदी में भी रिलीज कर देते यार 🥴
It was pretty good . They really tried a John Wick / Equalizer, very great attempt 👏
ohhhh wow! :) cool!
What if he was sent to audit mr wick....
great movie

Better than John Wick
Amazing film

OMG!!!! $20.00 just to rent this movie???? When I'm about to watch it for 💯💯% Free.👍👍👍

Better than john wick.  I enjoyed it so much . Very recommended
John Wick might be faster but Nobody can Hella take hits🤣🤣.. And he doesn't need a lawyer his name is feared
Wow,been a while since I watched a movie I can say was satisfying.This is 🔥
same vibes as john wick, definitely a must watch
What’s that song in 1:12?
This movie was ok 🙁
👍👍👍👍💯
I Mean it was good but it's not an action movie. Barely any fights. Most of the fights were music video style clips. If you've been watching fight movies and you need a break from fight movies, watch this one.

John Wick : car stolen , dog was killed. Mr. Nobody : his daughter's kitty doll was stolen.

rambo, punisher denzel, john wick, Saul... who is next?  maybe  ghost Elvis ... but always Russians asskicked, not fair, boring. once must Russians win.
So John Wick?
"Don't call the police"   Left Line Right There.
Better call Saul!!
what is the name of the music used during the Bus fight scene in this trailer?
I thought it was gonna be garbage. Sadly mistaken. This sh*t was pretty good. Good action, nice little plot, and the actors did well. I liked Bob odenkirk from breakin bad and better call Saul. I’d recommend this joint.
I saw this movie today and it was completely absurd.  The obnoxious music was hideously horrendous. Save your money and contribute to the ASPCA.
Nice movie guys keep going 🔥
Such a waste of time ! .. I’m sure ppl who admire it , they just want u to waste ur time as they did ..
I loved this movie to the core (basement) ! ❤️🔥
Plot Twist: Nobody is John Wick (Future):D
Um dos melhores filmes que já assisti... Se não melhor !!!! Parabéns ❤️
great!
I need a Nobody -JohnWick crossover that'll be lit🔥
You guys caught the mid-credit scene, right?
This is Good!
yo make him meet john wick, make it that first they fight after that they have the same enemy so they work togather to kill the same fucking enemy
Definitely watching this
Loved every minute of it, 10/10 would recommend. Definitely need a sequel for this one.
Bob Odenkirk FINALLY gets to shine in a “leading man" big screen role! I'm glad to see they're not all asleep in Hollywood. 👍🏻
Anyone seen the accountant? 😅😅  ...he's the Auditor... 💀💀💀
After a long time, I saw a action movie with style and humour. Good done director. Waiting for sequal.
The last scene was a call from john asking to join him against the high table as a payback from sparing the babayaga(nobody)s life.
i realy don't understand why you din't realese it on svod in all country and also i've seen the price tag 20dollar to rent the movie on amazon prime wtf is this price tag .
This movie was the shit, best action movie I seen so far for 2021.
Bob Odenkirk's acting is always top notch
How bout hutch, wick and 47 will meet going to the sommelier, man... That needs to happen!
Whats that song from 1:12
Honestly I found this most entertaining movie I've seen in awhile. Bob Odenkirk is at the top of his game, the reason this film is better than it should be. It's very funny and exciting, a little like John Wick meets the Man with No Name. To me the best part of a movie is when the characters' expressions speak the dialogue. Four stars.
wick/reacher/equalizer meet barney rubble. Not as choreographed as Wick, brutal like "the night comes for us".
watch it its worth your time
Downloading it now
holy fuck i, just saw this movie, i knew it was gona be great but didint know it was gonna be thiiis gooodd, this shit amazing, john wick, equalizer typa shit,, NEED A PART 2,3,4 IMEDIATLY
John Wick: Don't touch my dog Nobody: Give me the damn fucking kitty cat bracelet
worth it spending time
need a john wick x the equalizer x Nobody  movie
The hell? Saul as a former hitman? Hahaha
Thanks for recommending
John wick:hand me the phone Bowrey :who are you calling Mr wick: nobody
No body
When you order John Wick from Wish
Damn 🥵💣💥
They wisely left open the possibility of a sequel to this outstanding action thriller at the end of the movie!
damn good movie,
This is what happens when you forget to call Saul
I'm now have more respect for my auditor after watching this movie.
He better call Saul
This movie was too short for a "nobody" That's why I'll murder the director if we don't get a DAMN SEQUEL.
Who would have thought it, this whole movie was filmed in my home town. The last scene of the movie was a couple of blocks away from my house.
*nobody: *literally nobody:  nobody:..
“Beware of an old man in a profession where men die young”
stupid  movie  no thoughts  put into it. lots  things make  no sense
stupid  movie. john wick  wanann be.  lots  things dont even make sense
John Wick

Inspired from John wick
Finished watching.  Saul was awesome!  Must see.
John wick if he had a family
With everything he did in this film he better call saul
Excellent movie! Zero woke shit.
Loved it Guys... One of the Best Action Comedy Entertainment ❤️❤️
Well done. Something like Keanu and John Wick together. Good job.And the soundtrack is not bad.
Watched this the other night, its good...very good...
Jhon wick family edition 😂
Malayalees undo
John Wick spin-off.  I like @gameestarSobhan's comment..."Boogeyman, later killed by John Wick"
i had fun watching this af, and mr.christopher lloyd is a bad ass here
The movie was fucking amazing, crazy fun.  It deserves a sequel.
sounds like the last Rambo battle in city lol
Damm I just watched nobody. I need a sequel” I loved every minute of this movie. Better than John wick,”
Awful movie. Complete John Wick and Equalizer rip off.
He is like John wicks brother
Badass = Pantat Jelek ni pilm...!!
I just have to say...the grandpa fight scene at the shelter home...pure gold🤝
Well what can I say, the dad and his dad are total baddasses
You go Bob! 👍🏽
So much for being a lawyer
Soul Goodman
Bob Odenkirk -------- Half Life movie :DDDDDDDD
this movie kicked more ass than the trailer could have even shown.
I DON'T USUALLY EVEN COMMEND BUT THIS MOVIE IS MASTERPIECE
He is truly the elder brother of John wick and  need more sequences and chapters
Nobody  : That grandpa🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Iosef: That man is nobody Viggo: That fucking nobody is “NOBODY”
kittykat bracelet vs died dog
1:14 That's one of the Agents from Matrix.  And the taekwondo guy from Barry.
Unoriginal
Please can you all stop this collaboration with John Wick. I totally enjoyed this movie. Just like I loved John Wick.   Please let this movie, "Nobody" enjoy the moment and a future sequel if any. I don't like this comparison you guys are doing. Let them enjoy their separate fame.

Masterpiece! Watched it 3 times in a row
"Don't call 911, but you better call Saul"
Definitely a set up for nobody x John wick
This looks amazing.
Nobody: Nobody:
*john wick has left the chat*
“Nobody” is one of those movies that’s worth every penny of the $16.49 that I paid to watch at the theater.  It is also one of those movies that it’s worth the small trip just to go see and that’s exactly what I did. I had to drive two hours just to see “Nobody”.
Cool flick. "Ya'll got what ya'll wanted, and I got shot" LMAO
John wick: Dog Nobody: Kitty cat bracelet

Butter call Saul going bad ass 😄😄
Love it, love it... this movie it's that sh%$ I hope there is a sequel!
SAUL!!!
Very, very good movie
Stop talking about John Wick!!!  This movie is so much better than “John Wick”.
I would have to say that “Nobody” is a much better movie than “John Wick”. I hope for many more sequels to come.
30 years in the office makes bob becomes a kickass NOBODY
This movie is an instant classic. I’m so glad I was able to watch and enjoy it on the big screen (theater).
Epic film. Not to be missed 🔥🔥👌🏽
You know it's a great movie when you come on youtube to search for it after you just finish watching it. good movies are so rare these days
More hyperviolent movies pumped out by out Hollywood overlords....... probably watch it
Good movie, but in real life all times win Russian!
I just see more Jimmy Mcgill. And I am perfectly ok with that.
Awesome movie! Look forward to the sequel.
nobody💯🔥🔥🔥
Theres enough white straight male rage in the world. Not interested
Another to long trailer yall basically just watch the hole movie
This is a must see.
"Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet"
Looks badass! Gotta watch it!
John wick dad's basically
If you like John Wick movies you will dig this. It surprised me with how much I liked it
Who the fuck are you me I'm nobody
His dad just F badass hahaha..
I can watch this whit my family?
DUMB FILM
this movie is really really good
LOVED this movie!   It's "Falling Down" on crystal meth and steroids!
So now we got the John Wick Rival
He had me at, "Don't call 911."
Which is the ending soundtrack in the trailer, please let me know
A highly trained assassin comes out of retirement because of (insert circumstance) and a bunch bad guys from their past find out and they come after him.  Where have I heard this plot before?
Don't call 911, better Call Saul.
It was great seeing Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside in this.
Don’t call 911 call Saul
1:56 me every early morning.
The quartering brought me here this movie looks great
Хабиб пиже
“WHO? THE FU*CKING NOBODY?”
1:14 now THAT's how you do a #haka.
Again all this shit for a kitty kat bracelet its gonna be fun
Definitely better than John Wick. Just give it a try!
Nobody  a quite place suicide squad
Who else is hoping for a Hutch Mansell / John Wick crossover movie?
fuck this, it’s just John Wick Walmart version no, just shit
Did you guys remember when Viggo from the first part of John Wick said to his son "That F* nobody is John Wick?"
This NOBODY is John Wick
does this house have a basement?
Better call Nobody doesn't quite have the same ring to it though!
Finally the movie that doesnt make my wife laugh when someone speaks russian. Because of real russian actors!  Most of hollywood movies have terrible russian english accent. And the movie is good. Lots of killing but its funny when it tries to be
This house has a basement?
Freaking awesome movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
Nice movie but horrible casting tho.. Horrible!!
Finally saul finish his taekwondo classes🤣
He looks like max Payne
Honestly the trailer was a little misleading for me to think of it as another John Wick Ish movie. Like he said he worked for a group of bad people but (SPOILERS) he works for the government as their hitman (unless he is saying the government are bad people). Also that guy who said "When you left..." had a minor roll. Also, there was no debt he did not pay. Judging by the trailer, it looked like the main villain (the white suit guy in the trailer) was his boss but was not in the actual movie. The only thing I came close to seeing as the "debt" was when Bob Odenkirk beat up the white suit guy's brother (one of them in the bus fight) and actually killed him. But that does not connect to the group he left and had a debt.
Good  movie . Must watch !
"He's a fucking nobody" "That nobody is - John Wick"
s'all good man!
Stupid film .
Nobody, John and McCall...that would be something.
Feels really short, I want a sequel.
*when* *Saul* *Goodman* *got* *inspired* *by* *HEISENBERG's* *personality* 😂
BETTER  SAUL
Bob Odenkirk and Christopher Lloyd!..... This movie is AWESOME!!! I'm soooo happy watching something new that isn't all woke or any bullshit like that. Just an awesome movie that kicks ass!!! Highly recommendable!!! 👏👏👏
"I'M GONNA FUCK YOU UP!"   I really felt that! 😳😳😂
Nowadays police don't wanna interfere in a fight between good guys and bad guys. They just sit n enjoys the show
This is modified John Wick movie
This man is a part of angry man!
We want sequel ASAP.....
This movie is crazy good! I love every bit of it.
Saul got no chill 💀
the original story of the name artillery arthur
I already guessed that someone will say: who the fuck r u Meanwhile: Nobody
New Liam Neesan is born!
Trailer is better that the movie.
Yooo this movie its killing me!!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
This was good
Daaammnn tralier as good ad wrath of man jason statham, must watch movie!!
Me after watching this movie wondering what might the reaction of his neighbor be once he finds out his car is not on his garage the morning after. 🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Seems like a shit movie but i will watch it to see why people are praising it a lot , besides im bored and have nothing to do at the momemt.
I didn't expect this movie to kick-ass but damn... This'd better be a franchise coz I'm already looking forward to the next ones. Enjoyed this movie a hell lot.
Just finished watching with siblings. Had a blast. If you love action, some dark humor, and Christopher Lloyd with a fucking shotgun, then this movie is totally for you.
Best movie I've seen in a long time
Plz hind dub..
john wick home invasion version lmfao
Love this movie
Why does Odenkirk look so badass? Ugh. 😍
The name of the movie is : NO POLICE.
Best action thriller of year this year for sure... wouldn’t be surprise if he get an Oscar for this... One of the calm and cool character ever...  It's all good man (saul goodman)❤️💙❤️
Shittiest movie hands down
the best movie
Corny
No mames!! Me tripié viendo a Saul Goodman echando vergazos 😨
Fantastic movie mad that its underrated definitely recommend it
This was ALOT  better than what I thought it was gonna be.
Bus Song name pls,,,
Not what i was expecting. I won't spoil, but is nothing like john wick.
Better call nobody
Music?
Fucking Bob Odenkirk!!! ❤️ Extremely good actor, and too goddamn underrated.
Better Call Saul or Better Call Nobody?
good movie, loved it
Working on Nobody 2
It's the soundtrack for me.
Best Movie Ever. I'm exited in part 2
Best Movie Ever 🥰
I already want a sequel. Much better than John Wick
What Saul can't do? Guy kicks ass in the court and in the streets
Oh how I missed Naishuller’s movies.
But not compare to jhon wick
Copy of john wick😂😂😂😂
He should have called Saul.
Nobody: You brought so many shotguns Dad: You brought so many Russians  hahahahaha. made my day! and this is a must watch by the way
Not a bad movie, The guy was a hero from the start, not swinging that club is the only reason ungrateful little shit of a son is still alive.
Good Movie... Me likey....
Middle aged John wick
15 seconds into the trailer, a gun appears. You know it’s an American film.
This film makes Quentin Tarantino look like Walt Disney.
Nobody mess with Nobody
Russian Russian people, did you know that the main villain is Russian, and he is played by a Russian actor ?
The scene from 2:01 is not actually in the movie
In 2022 we see him and John Wick face of in a bombastic movie. Plottwist: They band together and kill Putin and the Russian Army.
Man the previews of him just getting beat up didn't do this justice, this looks awesome
What is this ! - Hate, Violence, Guns, Shooting. A man pointion a gun at someone. What is the mentality behind. Entertainment ? No, Neurotic and Psycotisc, Yes. No wonder why, there are school shooting around. The message is: You can solve allmost every probem with a gun. Weapon factories love this, and probably finance this too. Go to hell with that fukn.. gun mentality.
But this is fan dub in tamil.
Prequel please
Bob just made the whole movie awsome
the funny part when he met the black russian
He actually is Nobody. His FBI records were totally nuts when I saw it 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wasn't expecting this movie to be this good, a must watch action movie for sure!
It all started from a cat just like john wick started from a dog😂
We need more movies like John Wick and it looks like it
better call hutch
just imagine ... you killed john wick dog and after stole Kitty cat bracelet from Mr.Nobody.
Another one from Saul Goodman
I wonder how can his dad kill those two intruders with just two hands. With both his hand holding their guns how could he pull the trigger of the shortgun?
"That F*cking Nobody Is  sorry was John Wick"
My favorite movie in 2021
Saul Goodman 2021: I'm not in Danger, I am the Danger.
Deathwish V John Wicke. Nothing new comes out of Hollywood.
alee manemee
Producer from John Wick created John Wick Lite ☻☻
Great movie
Absolutely loved it. Like John Wick, The Equalizer and R.E.D together.
This looks good but the trailer feels like it spoils all the good parts
Working-class John Wick, such a fun movie!
"Nobody is Perfect" and  "I am that Nobody"
Legend says that he is the mentor of the john wick ☠️
What's wrong with this kind of movies, I mean if I don't beat some people my kids don't show respect, wife won't fuck, job suck, neighbours lame duck
Just watched this movie, if you're into anything similar to john wick, then you'll want to watch this movie. Action from beginning to end. Highly recommend this movie.
If I were lalo I'd be careful of pissing off Saul
It would be awesome if they make universe of The Continental with john wick, hutch and others in it 🔥🔥🔥
Want a sequel. Loved it
Funny version of john wick
Awesome movie. I enjoyed every second of it.
Me? I'm Saul Goodman, I'm an attorney and most importantly, siempre soy amigo del cartel
Me: waiting for John wick 4 Youtube: recommends me nobody trailer Me: giving 5 stars in google play store for youtube
We want part 2...plzzzzzzzzzz
Nowadays few oldies are getting action roles and the thing is they are nailing it better than any action heros.....
সল গুডম্যান ✌️🪓
Good trailer and very positive comments 😀 Now I want to watch this movie so badly but I still have to wait for a couple of weeks before he's released in Belgium pfff 😫
Him and John wick spin off would be the ultimate.
i watched this movie twice back to back . it will be a crime if there is no sequel.
Saul Goodman is the one who knocks!
As a LFC fan, nice touch adding YNWA to the soundtrack
I’m nobody
Good movie, it also had a John wick feel.
the trailer are much better than the movie itself
Okay so this guy gets in a fight with John Wick in the 4th John Wick movie, eh?
He used to be Saul Goodman Now he's Saul Badman
Looks like if John Wick had kids
Am gonna fuuuuuuck you up!!!!!
Special appreciation for the soundtrack 🔥🔥🔥
is he Better Call Saul?
This is an awesome movie!!!
LOVE IT!! Breaking Bad ..Ass 😂
for anyone just browsing the youtube search "trailer" for something quick to watch, this is perfect and is way above average for those kinda nights. The fight scenes alone are a solid top 3 out of all movies ive ever watched. Story is exciting enough to keep you on edge asking yourself what will happen next or showing remorse to characters.
THIS MOVIE IS FCKIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I paid for my sister and I to watch it in the theatre, also rented it for $20 for my cousin, uncle, and mom to watch it. Seriously invest in the movie !!! So we can get a second part!!!! I’m about to buy the Spanish version tomorrow so my dad can watch it lol. Seriously. It’s worth the watch 🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
finally some decent actors... sick of seeing the same washed up pieces of shit...
Can anybody pls tell what song is playing during the train fight scene?

OK, lesson learned: not taking cat's bracelet.
Hell of a movie😎
What is that song called ?
It's all about dam  kitty cat bracelet.......jr. john wick  was born
Hutch: John?  Wick: Hutch? I heard you are retired.  Hutch: Heard the same thing about you. What're you doing here?  Wick: They kill my dog, you?  Hutch: My daughter's kitty cat bracelet was stolen.
John Wick's vibes...this is so damn good . RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!
this looks so bad
Son hit by thieves,  Dad: it's okay son.. Dad's little princess: Dad where is my kitty cat bracelet... Dad: Time to activate killer mode...
Nobody meet john wick please

If there is a sequel, it should have been called *Nobody Cares.*
GTA 5 movie
he dies at the end of the move so sadd
I'm totally astonished when I saw the movie today it's breathtakingly insane so raw and feels like real action and I almost thought that this was John wick part 4😂
Time wasted.
is it me or this movie needed Bruce Willis ??
Great Scott!!
I don’t care what anyone says, this movie was amazing.
Winnipeg!

The sweetest PART was when the female HACKER ran off, after going through NOBODY'S profile. She said YULIAN dont pay me for this, goodluck... That moment YULIAN knew He was fcuked but a MAN's ego is terrible.
He is nobody alright?🐸
I love his style(calmness and brains)... I enjoyed the movie

"Does this house has a uhh...... a basement "
When you hangout with heisenberg  too much , obviously you will become nobody. 😂😂
Dadda Yaga!!!
Best of the best direction nd acting got a whole another level. Damn make more like this please
This is like john wick but with a kitty cat bracelet
he went Fromm lawyer to badass
GREAT MOVIE✌🏼✨✨✨🔥🔥
He's a man of commitment, focus and sheer fucking will!....oop...wrong movie😂
This is a boring predictable noisy stupid movie; which existence can only can be explained maybe by Odenkirks (star and producer) late success, ego and midlife crisis.
Please put him in the john wick universe
It reminds me to office season 7 for some reasons ((((:
This is moren action than "Taken"... ilove it!
The best movie I ever see in my life
I love every moment of Christopher Lloyd in this movie
Jack Reacher, The Accountant, The Equalizer, John Wick, and Nobody.
badass saul goodman
Okay, this was a great action movie. I got to say it,,,,, Queen Latifah should be ashamed of herself, this dude put in the work, she did not.
then he might be appeared on JW's next sequel #4.
One of the best movies America has made in years!!! What a movie! Zero and I mean Zero political garbage in it!  A 100% pure Glorious movie! Its been a long long time since I liked a movie that well. I never spend 20 for movie rental, so glade I did. I Willl be buying the dvd! This movie must have and needs sequels!!!
Which country is it in? I have a VPN but cant find it. I need help this movie looks so good
The movie was so awesome! Plus there were like actually people in the theater for the first time in months.  Fingers crossed for a sequel
creo q este es el hombre que llaman para matar a jhon wick, en sus peleas es mucho mas letal y rapido.
Is this connected to john wick they made it seem like it then the hole kitty kat bracelet and john wicks dog
I just saw this movie and it was absolutely epic ! And Doc Brown made this a gold material. Baba Yaga´s older brother
This is John Wick another world
This is why when ur in any trouble u better call Saul lol
Saul Goodman when he find out about Gustavo fringo partners
So this is what Saul has been doing after breaking bad
Absolutely loved it! Great movie! Lil bit of humor and a whole lot of badness!!
i feel like this movie had a massive rewrite after watching it,
This is how one make a fucking movie. Fallout music,blood and a beautiful mindset.
i bet its gonna be a great effing movie
Better call Saul? Never mind... better call Hutch!!!       Just saw this tonite... wow!!!!! 🔫🥵
Good luck, you can keep the money I’m good LOL. So many good scenes. this movie replaces my best movie.
The kitty cat bracelet= "put the bunny. Back in the box."
Best movie ever
I think he is bavani😂malayaliees✔️
The best movie in 2021
this is white equalizer  to me  not john wick
I loved every second of this movie. Saul was amazing, the fight scenes were innovative, and the cinematography downright rocked. I was impressed. The kitty was the cutest. This better have a zillion sequels and milk Bob's outstanding acting for what it's worth.
That God damn kitty cat bracelet
This is Soul - the best men of the whole world)))
I watched that badass movie.. He's the old version of John wick.. John had a dog and he has a cat.. Just that's the difference..
Good movie and Odenkirk did a great job.
bom filme!..
Don't call 911, better call SAUL !
Boy what a movie
Just watched it was damn awesome 👍
Man of focus, commitment, shear fu***** will
Bob Odenkirk has the Midas touch.  Everything he puts his name on is successful on some level; Instant success or a cult classic, if Bob’s name is on it, you’re in for a good time.
Watched it today.   Fucking *GREAT.*
give me the god **** my kitkat
I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS
R.E.D meets john wick ......
Sold! Going to check this out today! Never Underestimate A Nobody baby! YEaaaaaaaaa! Love it!

"I'm Nobody" Charles Manson used to say that
Where I can watch this movie
This movie was good
Music <3
He is the brother of john wick
Damnnnn
What a film!
Nobody knows a guy who knows a guy
Good actor, bad movie. It's a bad John Wick movie.

This movie was so awesome
Fuck sakes, same shit, one hero, russian mafia, killed everybody...Bob, please, you deserve better, Soul Goodman was amazing... What next ? “Nobody” join Avengers.
It ix a Movie U Should Watch.  If u love fighting ...
Is this some kind of joke from John Wick ????
Omg this is sooo good. Part II pls
Guess he found the cat.its just there on the table eating camly..lol
If Mr. Bean  was John Wick .
Just saw it yesterday. See it. You won't be disappointed.
Meh
my god. watched movie and came to see actual trailer, this is why I stopped watching any movie trailers. I had no idea who was he and what was going to happen.
This movie looks like it Saul Goodman!
“It’s not what you did that angers me. It’s who you did it to”  “Who? That f***king nobody?” “That f***ing nobody............       is nobody”
Saul Goodman's Redemption
Nobody:  Saul Goodman with John Wick's power: *"I am the one who knocks!"*
Trailer better than the movie
Absolutely loved it.
This movie is simply Awesome! The character portrayed by Bob Odenkirk is, in a way, the inner me.
Where to watch this? Cinemas are closed in the philippines
Waiting the sequel....amazing movie
Passing each other  Hutch: John John: Hutch  Add this little thing to the next john wick sequel and the people will go wild.
John Wick and Mr Nobody can fight Justice League together,what a tag team!
John Wick Lite
Better call Saul buddy he will help NOBODY ...
It needed more pavel, imo
Son: dad you look like shit  Dad: you should have seen the other guys...lol
don't you mess with kitty cat bracelet
This gets 5 stars from me can’t wait to go see it in theater
I liked the movie
Lol this is Joker mixed with John wick.
Dad u brought alot of shotguns.  You brought alot of russains 😂 Onehell of a movie ♥️
I watched this last night and it was good. Odenkirk was perfect for the role.
Made by a Russian director btw!
John Wick went on rampage bcoz of a puppy, Hutch went berserk bcoz of a kitty cat bracelet.  Fair enough
Well that was shit
So like John Wick. But more suburban dad with humor added
Watched this shitty movie yesterday. Don’t recommend at all.. too fake and boring. Don’t waste your time unless you’re 12 and like this type of action..
Do Not Call 911...Better Call Saul..!!
This Movie was so Spectacular!!! You Should watch This movie
Executive Producer: Tobey Maguire Me: *having mixed feelings about Spidey moving up the film making ranks to executive producer, but for an R rated movie...
This movie is DOPE.DOPE.DOPE..& did iMention Dope💯🇺🇸‼️ Perfect for U.S. Vets who's been down theater & g🎯t sum. Why they always say "Do you feel always on alert"? Me: 24/7 & iMiss that sheeeiT! G❤️‍🔥D Bless peeps-🤙
Better call Nobody.
Give me the Kitty cat bracelet ಠ_ಠ😂
I don't know why I'm watching the trailer again .when I already watched movie
Its all good man !
Jorhn Wick beats the whole gang for his lost dog Hutch Mansel beats the whole gang for his daughter´s lost kitty bracelet no need to tell us they have the same director, really ;)
Just finish watching this movie, man this one of the best action movie ever! Wish Nobody 2 coming out soon......
he fights in scene like profesional fighter this is comedy
Nobody  หนังแอคชั่นที่แฝงไปด้วยปราชญา
Good movie,if u wana watch it dont watch trailer

Don't mess with SaulGoodman  "You godamn right"
John wick with family
Reload media ♥️💫
Age rating?
Freaking awesome old man
Did I just saw the full movie 🤔
I am really sad for the H3 they destroyed at the scene with the bus. If it was mine i would cry for days.
In second part of NOBODY I want John wick and Nobody collaboration
I hope nobody movie part 2 coming out. And explain who is behind this badass father.
John Wick Like feeling
So basically if John Wick had a family :/
i'd pay for a john wick / nobody crossover.
Part 2 needed
Great freaking movie!!
when it'll be in theaters in india.
1:33 Nobody 2: "Call 911.. but not for me"
Ojala se encuentre en el mismo universo de John Wick porque estaria de cojones un crossover :O
Hopefully he's in the same John Wick universe because a crossover would be fucking hell: O <3
boring movie
stupid violence
Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!
I would like to know if this guy is in the same Universe of John Wick🤔... second part is about someone killing the Cat😤
It feels like Equalizer+Taken+John Wick=Trash
Looked promising until he just turned into a ufc fighter out of nowhere
Kevin Mcallister is all grown up!
The actual Home Alone/Rambo sequel we deserved.
Fire
This movie is great gives me a john wick vibe i just hope theres a sequel
Are we not gonna talk about how he brought back the legend himself Christopher Lloyd. This movies was such unique to watch and the music how it played out so well, there’s gotta be a sequel.
1:16 song name plz ???
1:14 music name ?? link ??
This movie was a pile of doo doo .  i made it half way through and cringed the entire time .  Then i got bored and cut it off .  just stupid .  i am a huge Better call saul /  breaking bad fan but man this was BAD .  the writing was a joke . worst script ever and Bob's character was just ridiculous .  He goes out to hunt down the home invaders that robbed his house to get back his daughters cheap kitty cat bracelet .  then he finds them and gives them a pass because they have a sick baby . WOW !  Just stupid .  It's like a 3rd grader wrote this script . Instead of calling the cops on the home invaders , Bob's character leaves angry & then fights 5 drunk guys on a city bus , i guess because he didnt get the cat bracelet ? then on and on with more so called action over NOTHING .  save your $20 .... or light it on fire because that would be more entertaining than watching this .
TOTAL VICTORY.  Bangin Soundtrack, Likable characters and ALL AROUND FUN!!!!!
Watchman
This movie was awesome. Please watch it.
Definitely, one of the better action movies I had watched in years most people are asking for a sequel but I think it's better off as one movie but if it happens to get a sequel it better on par with part 1 or better.
They should eventually do a colab with John wick whether it be nobody vs John wick or them working together
At Least he was able to save a stray cat.  . . . . I know someone who couldn't even save his goddamn dog..!
Ratings are pretty impressive. I thought it would be another lame ass action movie. Should give it a watch 👀
"I've never seen a black Russian before " lmao
Dude, I always thought odenkirk was hot, but now 🔥🔥🔥
Perfect
Who are you? I'm nobody. An auditor, as in, uh... the last guy in any organization, who wants to see at their door.
Done watching at this moment.. 🤯 my brain can't handle it..so f*ckin' amazing 😲😲😲
This was pretty much a way better version of John wick.. best movie I’ve seen in awhile!
Oh shit. Better NOT call Saul...
So basically, he's Liam's alternate reality twin
Hollywood with no new ideas
Story bout when john wick get old😂
MUST HAVE PART 2 PLEASEE . THATS MOVIE REALLY COOL .

1:04 me in front of my crush
Bowery King: We're gonna need all the help we can get... John Wick: Do you have a phone? Bowery King: *Hands over phone* Who are you calling John? John Wick: Nobody...
I am so into this 🤩 Cannot wait to see this 🥰😁
I just seen this shit it was crazy!! This dude need to play Max Payne in a remake that is much needed!! Dude dad in the nursing home poppin off lmao🤣🔥
Okay Kids ,, so whenever someone takes your Kitty Cat Bracelet, what do you do? Kids: Better Call Saul
I don't know, I always see a lawyer who knows someone who knows someone.
I just watched the film and holy crap it's so siiiiiick!
So it's Saul after he got a new identity
Yeah I know BETTER CALL SAULL
That was not a good movie at all but i was just happy to be back in movie theaters
DAMMN!! This movie so fcking epicc 👍👍 I hope have trilogi .
Better Call Saul
O LIGNADIS
Loved it ❤️ can't wait for part 2. ❤️❤️
Just saw it in the Xbox marketplace. Can confirm it’s Wick 2.0 and just as amazing
De la tuerie ce film sa fait longtemps que j'ai pas vue un bon film d action comme celui ci mais vraiment et les acteurs joues bien . Pas le temps de s'ennuyer
such a it's all cool man
Just saw this film. It was GREAT, finally an action movie worth of the money!!!
John Wich + Family, - Long Hair = Nobody
Spoiler - Spoiler - Spoiler - Spoiler I really enjoyed watching this movie, there´s a lot of unconventional action - not the usual mainstream Hollywood crap - however the movie has its flaws too. Let´s take the example where the russian mob comes to his house the night he made lasagna for his family and talks about going on vacation to Italy. Why the fuck would the Russian mob come to his house - driving in a convoy of 10 cars - like the most visible thing they can do? I bet you could see from Mars that 10 cars were approaching the house. Why not just send ONE man to liquidate him - or shoot him when he leaves his home for work? There are other examples in the movie that are just unrealistic and just reduce the quality of an otherwise great movie.
Best action comedy movie I’ve seen in a long time
John wick’s lawyer
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Nobody call saul
The best movie 2021
This movie is good.  But whats weird is.  A lot of shooting scene inside his house.  But his neighbor didnt even heard something xD
2:48 that fucking nobody is John Wick.... ohhh sorry wrong movie🤪
Movies like this are rare 🔥🔥
Haha damn funny Movie!!!
Liam Neeson looks different here
i like this movie, this is a good fucking movie, go watch it
This is a version of John Wick (without dead wife, dead dog) that really make my birthday memorible
Good all the way to the end
i really liked it, hope it gets noticed. Its not boring at all at least for my taste and i recomend it its only 1,30min-40 i think
What a great film!
Never thought Bob Odenkirk could played an action role but the outcome is fantastic!!I want sequel so badly!!!
Meh
i love this movie..
Bob Odenkirk need to play in S craig zahler directing movie.  He's absolutely he's guy. Like leonardo with Scorsese.  Specially Another Bone Tomahawk or Dragged Across Concrete or Brawl in Cell Block 99.  İmagine mystery thriller westen with  Kurt Russel, Mel Gibson, Bob Odenkirk and Vince Vaughn... Will be amazing!
The over 3k people that didn't like it are nobody's.
amazing movie  the best one year now. sequel please
jimmy became a family man after walts death but they just had to take his kitty cat bracelet!!
Dosvedanya. When russian mobsters hits the ground. 😊👍
so ..it's kind of a John wick Ripoff right? is it good to watch?
Good movie tho I wish it went a little bit more towards comedy
THIS SHIT IS BIG 😍😍😍
Excommunicado.
you think there is anything left to watch in that movie? do not watch the trailer, itsa fkn spoiler
This movie was so good
This movie was fucking awesome!🔥
So... "A History of Violence" then
This would of been John Wick if his wife never died. Sadge
I want a Crossover between Mr NOBODY and Mr FUCKING NOBODY vs The  HIGHTABLE
John Wick's family version?🤔
The part about "your creditor is aware of your resurrection" didn't happen in the movie
So it's suburban John Wick. Okay I like it.
10/10
This Is Surprisingly Good....!!! Nobody meets Mr Wick + Family and Friends..!
Just give the damn kitty cat bracelet back problem solved... :')
Nobody......gets out alive from him.
as nobody, can I just say, the premise is to take him in alive yet they go into his house and spray bullets at him. All movies fail this and it really annoys me
BAD ASS
In gonna  Fuvk you up hahahhah best one ever!!!
ABILIVIMA ABILINIVIMA ABILINIVIMA HUT ABILIVIMA ABILINIVIMA ABILINIVIMA HUT  IT’S NOBODY. “NOBODY”
This movie is like John wick except the wife didn't die
BETTER CALL SAW
I'm gonna foock you up
It was great action movie. That bus sence alone was mindblowing.
This movie is epic. Watched it! Think of it like a mixture of John Wick meets The Accountant meets Home Alone lol
Can anyone tell me which is the bgm song which is playin in this?
seems like John Wick universe - intersting though
Damn I’m hyped over this wow impress jus by the trailer I give it a ten scoring open cinema an axed vaccine passports
Wow better call Saul I didn’t even finish season one now u a badass ok imma find this and watch love breaking bad jeezz
ABILANIMA ABILANIMA ABILANIMA NA HUT  IT’S NOBODY
John Wick vs Nobody vs Equalizer
Better call, saul
He is John Wick Neighbour
The sequel should be called "No-Basement"
Bob odenkirk as an action star, i dont believe it but after this movie, i totally buy it. He was amazing, insane action and he is John wick meets equalizer
Una verdadera MMMMMM no la pude terminar de ver, estoy harto del cine americano, pensé que era algo similar a Better Call Saul pero no, parece un argumento de Alberto Olmedo en Alvarez & Borges. A partir del 2014 los malos ya no son de oriente medio, ahora es la mafia rusa en Estados Unidos? son tan Obvios!!!!! No miro mas cine Americano!!!!
IS GREAT!!!
Greate Scott!
Dont mess with nobody
The movie is like what if John wick had a family 😂
I'm thinking that will be a crossover between Nobody and John Wick in the future... Mark my words!
Check my YouTube channel you might find some interesting stuff
Part 2222222222222
lol, why would anyone want to watch a cringy john wick rip off? I'm so confused
Cool
This house have a basement?
What a noob lobby feels like..
Very nice movie, hope Bob Odenkirk will be selected for more movies like this. He deserve it 💯 !
sucks
John Wick's brother
Eat your hart out John Wick!... this guy has far last fancy moves than you do and 200% more bad ass!  Now THIS was Entertaining!  FINALLY, an action Film that did what movies are suppose to do. Entertain me!  Godzilla vs Kong was suprisingly very Entertaining as well.
Was excited for this, watched it yesterday.  It was good, the only thing is that the pacing was a little off at times i guess.
Waiting for part 2 😂
John Wick 4 ....
Maybe he is the boogyman.. that john wick killed in the imposible task.
love it :)
Cross between John wick and a history of violence... And we all know how good they are
Saul Goodman 😀👍
AINT NOBODY! AINT NOBODY! AAAAAAINT NOOOOBODY! wtf..
John Wick: They killed my dog Nobody: They took my daughters kity cat bracelet
I can only see a lawyer
Beware of oldman in profession, where men usually die young. Dis line is suitable for his dad,his chararization was LIT😎🤏
He is fucking John Wick elder brother
Nobody:   Nobody: I am gonna fu*k you up!
It's was good they didn't defined the identity and his past life , cause sometimes mysteries are best left unspoken.
Ok action flick, a mix of John wick and the The Equalizer.  But not as good IMO.
Do svedaniya..till the next movie
Just saw it, fucking awesome, it's like Mike Banning and Bryan Mills combine as a hardcore SOB, I'm looking forward to the sequel 🎬 #Basement
This is basically a John wick movie
This nobody theme song is very irritating  but everything else is <3
മലയാളി പൊളിയല്ലേ 🌹
Same ol story, bunch of exaggerated action sequences. Family guy with a particular set of skills takes down russian mob nuthin new. 6/10 stars
Wooo...I hope we get to watch part 2
Just saw this movie and I highly recommend it it soooooo goood!!!!!!! I give it 5 stars!!!
This movie is really good!
1:12  Habilibabe habilibom 🤣🤣😂🤣😂
GODAMM U SAUL GOODMAN

This movie was so damn good, there definitely has to be a sequel.
Part 2 please ehehe. When hutch said, do you have a???? And his wife just continue what he wants to say, A BASEMENT! deym. Part 2 is waiving
Greate respect to brilliant actor Bob Odenkirk and amazing director Ilya Nayshuller!!
John Wick - dog. Nobody- Kitty Cat 😂
Who else watched the movie and found out that the trailer is the best part of it...
Awesome movie
What brand on stainless tumbler?
Nobody: Literally nobody:
مو فلم براسة 60 احض
Imagine being so badass that being called Nobody doesn't even work as an insult.
Just watched this movie and it’s awesome!
This man is a maniac!!!
feel like I just saw the movie with that trailer lol
This was a great flick
They should make this in the same time-line as John Wick and have them meet and team up.
Nobody but Saul!!!
Is this within the Wick universe?

They did copy a lot from John wick movie but I still like the movie
Just watched it , epic.
This movie is freaking awesome 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍, thats what we call a movie
What kills me in this movie is the horrible info. 4.9L muscle car? Never heard of that. The called a pistol a 45 when it says 9 mm right on the side
WAITING, NOBODY PART TWOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just finished watching this. I highly recommend this movie. Great action. Though it felt like it's part of the John Wick universe.
Great movie. It's like john wick and punisher caracters in family guy mode haha
I am so wishing and hoping this movie exists in the same universe as John Wick.
Hi, you've reached the office of Mr. Saul. Mr. Saul has momentarily stepped out as Judge Dredd. Please leave your message. Thank you for calling Better Call Saul.
I watched the movie,he was good🙂
Badazz movie!!! Must watch!!!!
Aka "better call saul : retirement plans "
Excelente!!!!!!
I LOVED IT!
NOBODY: DONT CALL 911  fcking badass!
يلعرب الفلم بعدة منازل 😀
Everyone is like "this is John Wick" like A History of Violence didnt come out a decade before it, and Death Wish before that and millions of others in between. This isn't a clone, its a genre.
What the hell! Why is he a John Wick? I thought he is just a shitty lawyer to a shitty chemist
You better just call saul
I saw this movie its a great movie u should watch it
Better than John Wick 1, 2 and 3!!!!! Nowdays it's all about hero-chicks and Feminazi. The Lunatic Left will pan this movie cause there ain't no super-chicks in it.
One of the best stock this year!
This better have a sequel.  Enjoyed every freaking moment of it.
I laughed my shit out of me with granny killing the first 2 mans 😆😆😆
Who is in here on 4/16/21 and going to see this movie tonight?!
Good flick
Just saw the movie. All I can say,"white male rage"!
Seen it and it was fantastic. Just a very fun movie from start to finish!
better call Nobody
absolute cliche and nonsense full copy of john wick and it wasn't funny at all its just unrealistic with medicore action scene the only good thing about this movie was cast and music , overall there was no story and If you are bored Maybe this movie isnt a bad idea
Great movie 🎥🤯
Amazing film, would recommend it.
Dats litterally a John Wick copy, which is way less hardcore   ...good dat no one actually pays 2 watch movies
a rollercoaster of John Wick, equalizer, gemini man etc........ it's nice to be original
This is Walter White's Lawyer from a Series called  *BREAKING BAD*
Thought the trailer was awesome just watched it it really sucked  Good music and good actors dont equal good movie
2:46 he should've called saul before speaking to the cops
loved the bus scene. i need more of this
Just watched it. Its pretty much, John Wick meets The Equalizer meets A History Of Violence, but it's kinda more in the vein of Drive or You Were Never Really Here but with more of a comedic!/spoofy element. I liked the first half, especially the bus scene, but it started to go downhill towards the end for me, 6/10, it's good
Have to say it was a pretty good movie.
Just watched it, had a bunch of laughs and really enjoyed the movie!
I guess they called Saul
I am not in danger Am the danger
I watched it right now, and I just want to say one thing...... If you're frustrated and bored from your mundane life, watch this right away.....bloodshed never felt so satisfying before.
Finally Bob gets this kind of role... I I like it when simple people (comedians) like Bob get a chance to prove they can do other things.  It's weird that you couldn't imagine him doing this but then it looks perfect for them.  Can't wait to see this.
Just watched it. A masterpiece
Fun movie.love it
That is A Good Dinner time Movie
what a movie
Best movie ever❤️❤️❤️ way Unexpected
Wow I watched the movie it was light 💡
Good ‘ol Bob O!!!  Ok!
Nonsense movie.
Is this supposed to be action/comedy movie?
Similar to john wick
Don't watch the trailer if you don't want to be spoiled. It's a good movie if you like action. Watch it without watching this.
At last something to watch
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeee
Easily one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years.  It's like a lighthearted version of John Wick with dark humour in spades.
Imaginig walter white in saul place
Its Dad Wick
Looks like a john wick
copy of John wick
Well we have seen many similar movies but i'll give chance to this movie.... Looks Good!
😎
"You missed the garbage"...Sound like me...😂
Holy shit Kevin Costner and Justin Bieber in 1 movie!
Dont just watch the trailer, watch the movie too...  Its worth it
Damn good movie
Dont call 911 😂📞
very much liking. enjoy!
I watched this movie, I loved it, and I thought "this is like a new and GREATLY improved version of John Wick". I come and watch the trailer -"from the producer of John Wick"
What’s the song in the background Hanabaleba hanabalega or something like that?? Lol
It is gonna merge with John wick universe
Just watched.  This movie IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOD 😍😍😍
First movie: nobody Second: somebody Third: everybody
Who the fuck are you? I am Nobody.
When we demand for John wick 4  They gives us a new character with different stories 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
John Wick ripoff
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏎️
Call the ambulance but not for me!
this is some john wick level shit!!!
I need a part 2. Times ten better than john wick ;)
Saul Goodman  Better call Saul
Best movie I've seen all year!!
-Its no what you did son, is who you did to.  -Who, the f$cking nobody?  *TRIGERED*    *Now everything has senseeeee*
im pretty sure wick call Hutch
This Movie is awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Malayali😍
For twelve years he worked for Heisenberg, Gus Fring, Tuco, Jessy pinkman.  Soul Goodman is now _Nobody_
Who the fuck are you? Bob:I'm John wick's grandpa...
Better call "saul"😉
Soul Man does his job well.  😂😂😁😁😁
First the dog.....and now a Kitty cat bracelet, can't wait to watch this movie
Isn't he the guy who knows a guy?
That F***ing "NOBODY" Is "John Wick" 🔥
Imagine if this director creates a universe with this guy actually getting to show down against John wick?
John Wick other version
Imagine if  they would have stolen the cat..
Another Kevin Costner movie??? Sign me up
dude this movie was Dope
Awesome movie. Part 2 will be a great idea! Leggo!
The trailer did fool me to think this was a comedy. A solid 8/10.
Trailer literally spoils the whole movie as usual.
Freakingly amazing.  can someone just tell me the song's name in the nightclub .. the girl singin 🥰
John wick + equalizer
Please dubbed in Tamil 😭🙏
Saw It Yesterday It Was Awesome 😎
Award winning movie and actor❤️❤️😻
Give this man his kitty cat goddamn 💪🏼
This film is sooo damn good. I thought it would be another generic 'man protects his family from bad guys' movie, but oh, its so much better than that! Massivly entertaining! Loved it! :))
I watched the movie but still don't get who he is or worked for and dunno if I missed a clue because im hella curious
This!!! Make this Hollywood. NOT FCKING TAMMY/MELLISSA MCCARTHY remakes. THIS!!!!
Who we gonna call now? 🤨
I feel like have watched the whole movie from the trailer
0:39 so we’re just not gonna talk about that?
John wick vibe
"It's just a fcking kitty bracelet!"
Bob Odenkirk in JOHN WICK 4- the alter universe.
Now we get whole fucking family of Johnnn wick
This is John Wicks granpa
its all good, man 😎
So like john wick but instead of a dog and 20 bucks ? And a kitty cat looks good tho so watching now
Now I can't sleep until I find out if he got the kitty cat bracelet back or not
Saul Goodman🙌🙌🙌
I'm in!!!
Bob played very good. he's playing perfectly funny and serious mixed roles.  Movie looks like poor mans equalizer but Bob performance make it worth. 10/6.5
Wow, what a trailer. Do I even need to see the movie at this point?
Bob odenkirk as a one man army you got my attention.
2:23 Saul Goodman is d only action star hu can gun you with Cornflakes 🤣🤣🤣
nobody: give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet.........
Deym this movie is badass!
Looks good but almost seems like they showed the whole film in the trailer 🙄
Was some this movie made in winnipeg cause the downtown parts look familiar
john wick universe theory
Saul Goodman is really the Badman. He's Breaking them Bad.
Looks like Keanu Reeves has some competition
that fucking cheesy voice at the end  fucked up the trailer #WAYTOOCRINGE
The only problem with this movie, is IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER!!!
Woah... That's an awesome trailer🔥
I'm gonna watch this
Smart guy wow
How the hell does someone (the main character in this movie) forget something as stupid as remembering to put the Bin out each Monday morning??? It's such a stupid job even the kids can do it.... Most of his problems are things he can easily fix by not being such a SCREW UP!!! (Sort of like MY LIFE!!!!)
Tunechi Approves
I see John Wick and I know its going to be good..
Just finished it and it is a dam good movie
i have done my work for the day Life has its problems, I get more than my share i have been in quarantine but i have nothing to complain because of you tonight i will have fun  it may be free but what can i do it must be done Oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
After watching this movie, i kinda feel bad for the Russians. It was really just him venting and the Russians just took the full brunt of his violence LOOOL
I don’t know where this movie came from... but god damn! Bob Odenkirk as a John Wick is too good to not watch!
This is basically family version of john wick 😁
2:48 DANG that's COOL.....
Another perfect montage. This will win a lot of awards like Parasite.
"They call me Nobody" old spaghetti western.
Don't call 911? Really? I don't buy this. John Wick already tickled me enough.
song?
What is the title of Russian music at the 38 th min of the film?
I just saw this movie.. wow.. what  a rush... absolutely fantastic.. John  Wick.. with  a wife.
Jason Bourne but this time is a 50 years old accountant.
just finished watching this. GREAT F*KN MOVIE!
Gives me John Wick vibe. Leaving the past dark life for a peaceful life until a incident forces him to go back to his old ways.
I just finished it and I wish I forgot about this movie and rewatched it over and over and over again 10/10
It's good only for some 12 yo kid. For any adult this is just a cheap joke.
guy is highly trained has children puts gun loaded in empty box and in freezer epic fail who writes this shit
That cat eating its dinner is cute!!
Jimmy Wick.  Ive got $15 for that!
John wick: You killed my Dog! Nobody: Give me the God damn Kitty cat bracelet!
Saul, is that you?
Kiddie kat braclet ?gay and you no its lame
Whole movie in trailer
we want Nobody Part 2
this is great, gonna watch
Bob Odenkirk is a great actor. But we knew that from BB and Better Call Saul. This movie though.. is like a music video. It's good for what it is, but could have been so much more.
I'm a simple man. I saw Saul Goodman, I clicked.
Now I know that If an old man says hes gonna fuck me up, hes gonna fuck me up
Somebody better call Saul
trashest movie i habve ever watched so childish wasted my time
Bad copy of John Wick do something original amk
i hope he know a guy who know a guy
It was amazing
OK JUST FINISHED WATCHING IT: :D This movie was written by a 10 year old with crayons after watching John Wick ....THE MOVIE IS RIDICULASLY FUN!!!!! The mobsters are actual russian actors ....bravo for that !!! This movie is horribly outstanding :D LOVED IT
I'm not in danger  *Saul* I am the danger
song 1:14 please?
This shit better have Part 2. Otherwise I'll send JOHN WICK to his house.
I would love to see the cross-over (and this isn't new) where he and John Wick team up. So looking forward to watching this tomorrow.
The series should have been " Better call Paul" and this movie should have followed with the name "Saul"
Never steal a little girls kitty cat bracelet. Don't make the same mistake these fools did.
Wife : what hapening?! Nobody : its just kity cat bracklet.
A masterpiece
what the hell i just watch OH MY GOD
he has a cat now, so dont kill the cat, or mr wick and mr nobody will fuck em up!
Watching it rn haha
I'm so freaking glad to see Bob Odenkirk get the lead role he deserves!
So John Wick but without the fresh idea or physical proves of main lead. Gotcha.
Just saw this movie, it beat all my expectations. Amazing work!
Good and fanny movie
AWESOME AWESOME MOVIE...ACTION PACKED!
Started out good, but then it got really far fetched and over the top.
Ima watch it to day
Worst movie i hate that old man wtf 😂😂😂 😂😂😂
I want to see the BOOGEYMAN and NOBODY facing each other ....who else?
i simply can`t watch Saul Goodman in this baddass role LOL
Renting it tonight
I need this film in TAMIL...
Now SAUL has retired from his jobs
ഒരേ pwoli
Saul is a bit of a badass
Just finished watching it, really enjoyed it. Has such a similar tone to John Wick series.
John Wick's grandpa?
John Wick  🤝  Nobody  = who touches them die
JohnWick : They shot my dog.  Nobody : They stole her Kitty cat bracelet.  Moral : If you are a bad guy don't be cruel to animals or anything related to animals.
If you love john wick you should watch this
when captain price has been retired...
Better call Saul Cause Saul doesn't call "Nobody".
Saw this yesterday. Highly recommend.
Best movie this year!!!!comedy,action,a bit unrealistic,but a very nice movie.Good job
New John Wick everybody
This would be John Wich's life if his wife didn't die...
Better call Nobody (Saul) 😂
This guy is gonna come out as Arya Stark
we need this guy, since liam neeson just died riding a bus somewhere in Chicago.
Godamn that last cigarette scene just defining a new defination of nobody.
He's really mad that he didn't get tugboat back.
What happens when you don’t call Saul
The movie is really  but the actor is not too good is like coping John wick
So its crossover of John Wick and R.E.D ?
I thought Hippolyta would help Saul.😂😂
John Wick: attacks after the crime Nobody: attacks before they commit crime.
The movie is better than the trailer🥴😂😂
Yup...my kind of movie.  Hell yes.
This film was awesome
It would be great if they can start a hitmanverse where assasin and hitman cross path,  john wick, nobody, maybe the accountant if you have watch that and also the equalizer.
Just watched it and its the first movie this year i`ve enjoyed, well done all concerned 9/10 It deserves a sequel.
A movie I'll watch forever until the day I fucking die
I think I just found a forever watch movie
It's is amazing loved it so much
I just love this movie
This movie is so amazing
I fucking love this movie
GAVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!
Oh wait is that the lawyer from breaking bad?
That guy Better Call Saul
is there a second one next?
nice
I m sold
Watch it .I highly recommend it.All the characters are bad ass..I hope there is part 2.
This is the best movie I have seen in YEARS.  None of the gender politics and "wokeness" that has infected literally every show and movie since 2018. It's refreshing to see that studios still remember how to make entertaining movies instead of trying to win the Woke Olympics.   THANK YOU!
Watch it last night.. its good, poor fight choreography but still enjoyable  Need sequel tho..
i.... LOVED IT
john wick lvl0000
That one guy in the bus  isn't he the lead actor of kickboxing retaliation he took on Batista  but now getting his ass kick by a random old guy.
Hey are you Saul...?.. , "nah.. I'm nobody"..
This is awesome!!
This movies is too short💔
Old John Wick...
Looks good
Better call nobody!
А pусский колорит динамики тоже в наличии.
now this looks like a good movie. it shows you do not have to do new things every time. you can always do old things in a better way.
Glad I didn't watch the trailer, it spoiled so much
Not the kittycat bracelet! 😲
Jesus, just give him.
Guess who directed the movie  for Saul 🤣
this movie is great man ....you get to see Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd)from Back to the Future  smoke a bunch of fools .....its a must see movie ...
Whats the song at 1.12?? 😎
Finally, a dad who's not a loser movie. This is going to be great!
I came here after seeing William Osman's video, and wanted to see the doc shoot some people.
This comment section is funny af 😂😂
Can you tell me the song which played in train please ?
This movie suuuucked. It was a blantant ripoff of John Wick. If JW's wife survived and they had kids. Odenkerk looks slow and sluggish. Hes not made for slick action choreo like Keanu. The movie is onlly an hour and 27 minutes giving you next to no story. Just mindless poorly choreographed action scenes.
February ?? What year!!!????
this movie is the shits
0:29 subtle reference to wexler mcgill
Where do i watch the movie?
you guys are so unfunny and unoriginal with the lawyer and saul and john wick jokes, get your humor up or stfu
the fucking title drop lmao
You better stay soul ^^
I feel like I just saw the whole movie in a trailer.. welp now I don't have to buy this thank you!!
Ok another john wick movie
bruhhh....this looks soo good! why have I not heard of this before until now watching another youtuber? Definitely going to watch it!!
Another waiting to get shot movie.. even they have the chance to gun him down...exactly like john wick..ughhh
Manson?
Anyone else here because of Smartless?
John wicks dad
I just wanted to listen to Mitski but I found this 😭
This confirms it.  Bob Odenkirk has went from a Top Tier Actor,  who's "work"  is Very Enjoyable,  Entertaining and well worth the time....  to,  something like this.....  Friend A. asks Friend B. ... "Hey brother,  you up for catching a late movie?? "  Friend- B ... "Nah man,  I just got off a Double and I'm beat,  plus I need to be up at 5am."   Friend - A .... "Ah man that sucks dude!!  Galaxy just got  Bob Odenkirk's new movie and they're  running it all weekend... 4 shows a day starting tonight at midnight. "  F-B .... "Don't forget the Redbull,  pick me up in 5 minutes !! "   😏
John wick that you
I think he better call saul after all those killings
Damn I want to see that movie
Does this movie have any relation with breaking bad or better call saul?
Im here from ted nivison
Just yes.
Yeahhhh!!!
I can just tell that if he goes to jail he is gonna need a lawyer 😉😉
please make cross over with john wick..
so he's a cat guy.. interesting
is that john wick with family?
Who else is waiting for William Osman's version of this
Everybody gangsta until somebody take the kitty-cat bracelet.
Gave it a chance but had to turn it off after 5mins...🤮🤮🤮
This movie was a fun watch! Would definitely see it again!
Ted Nivison sent me here
Name of song?
Oh Saul u fucked up again and don't go back to known as Mr Miguel
Will be on OTT  by 16,April,2021
Where can I get this movie free.??
Which streaming platforms will it come out on?
Thread Level Midnight is looking different
Ted nivison sent me here and the film looks promising!
Bob Odenkirk John Wick. I'm so into this.
Sakamoto Days...
give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet😂
here from Ted's video
Damn, he might be the other brother of the other nobody
I'd like to see a trilogy next one is his past and in the 3rd it's revealed he is the Boogeymen who john wick was sent to kill.
I just saw this! It was REALLY good! Was pleasantly surprised!
This is exactly how you don't make a trailer, showing the whole movie...
Saul goodman vs john wick
Movie is waste of time .... Americans just cant live without Russians hahah
Rumour has it that when: the equaliser,John wick and Jason born are busy  They call this guy
2:39 I really want to see some sex scene from ❤️ Connie Nielsen. Since I haven't seen her doing sex after Devil's advocate.
This sucked balls
This was a Great movie . I had no idea about this movie prior to watching. Didn’t watch trailers. It was fantastic. Action packed and loads of funny
what song is in the background when nobody fight with those guys(in bus fight scene)?
He gets the cat. Cool.
What a brilliant trailer movies like this never came quite often I'm going to watch it right now.
That bus scene was amazing!! This movie rocks!
link? plis ;v
Ngl I'd like to see this somehow be connected to John Wick, like a cameo or a reference to John would let the two work together or clash. 👀
When I first heard of a Nobody movie, I assume it's a Keith Sweat biopic.
Saul To Walt: 0:44
is this a movie reminds me of john wick with fists instead of guns?
Great. Another John Wick. Very unique.
People thinking John Wick but I was thinking Taken
Hope somehow this is in the same universe as John Wick. Would be cool to expand the universe.
“He’s a (freaking) nobody!” “That (freaking) nobody, is nobody!”
I can get behind a guy doing anything to save his daughter, someone using his espionage skills to help strangers in need, and of course who doesn't want to see dog killers punished.  But now we're seeing a guy going out and starting fights with baddies to prove he's not a pu$$y.  Dude if you want to pit your family in danger or at the very least leave them without a husband and father to feel young again just get a motorcycle.
Better Call SOOOOOOOOOOOL
People thumbs downing a movie they never seen need a life.
he'd better call Saul
I just love saul thats it 💯🔥
He.. he said the thing!
Bob Odenkirk, say no more
Is this only available to watch at the cinemas? I can't find it anywhere except for a very poor quality camera version on a movie streaming site.
Jimmy looks a lil different here
You should've stayed with the first narrative, a nobody that reached his breaking point and just goes apeshit cold killin bitchs. But you ruined it by making him Rambo on the down low.
Which tone is used in video? Like alebaleba😂
I guess he got sick of managing a Cinnabon and called the "vacuum place" again. btw this looks like it's on the same universe as John Wick.
This is what heppend when he lost tugboat
Good
Saw this sat night, it’s amazing , Christopher Lloyd is in there !
You worked on this but Where TF is the new season of BCS ? Bobby the paper chaser
Can we please get a John Wick and Nobody crossover????
Saul just got a new job haha
GAS
If you can see this comment, PLEASE DONT WATCH THIS TRAILER. I promise you on my life that you want to see this movie...Just do NOT watch this fucking trailer, it gives away like 75% of the movie.
jhon wick form wish
Better leave Saul the fuck alone
Is it Louie Prima on the soundtrack?
Better call Wick?
This movie was bloody amazing!
So now you're selling Belize tickets eh Saul?
I have it, I downloaded it before only 1 hour, I will watch it after 2 aw 3 hour
Yeah,  if you get mugged in any big city in america it's probably going to be russian teenagers who do it..........
Darn Saul goodman is badass!
ok jack reacher
Damn gud
i think comes very close to john wick althought the movie here is much less heavy...thats good.....& have more funny moments....no doubt a sequel can come who knows it will take same road as john wick series
hole movie was in the trailer? wtf???
he just need a pencil
I’m so going to watch this! wow, 2021 got exciting.
What the heck, Jimmy?
That fucking NOBODY is John Wick's Lost Brother.
Bob Odenkirk in Saul, You better call John Wick.
this is gonna be fucking awesome
When is it available on iTunes ☹️?
Damn saul goodman
John Wick: better don’t call Saul
Feels like John wick
Hey john you have a compilation
This is an Ikea type of production, assembly is required - when you watch it you have to imagine all of the bad white guys as BLM, and then you'll get it.
pretty sure this is John wick in an ALternate Universe with a family.....
Someone better call Kim Wexler..
I just saw this movie and LADIES and GENTLEMEN its AWESOME!!!!!!! This guy is like the equalizer. He and Denzel MUST work together. A Real Good movie!! Love it!!
If you seen the movie, all imma say is, HELL YEAH GRANDPA.
Truly wise men will never let it get to this.
john wick
"Better call Nobody"
Question, can he kill them with a pencil?
I saw the movie I honestly did not expect it to be this good at all
"For twelve years, I worked for some very dangerous people." — Saul Goodman, former criminal-defense lawyer
well id better call Saul
My boyfriend and I saw this movie last night and it was absolutely amazing! 1,000,000% recommend!
This film is awful, saw it yesterday after been plagued with marketing on youtube. Its vacuous, not funny, not a very good action movies.  If i had seen it a month ago I would have just thought it bad but I saw Gangs of London over the past couple of days, which is an awesome action tv series, and it just brought home how shit Nobody is. Bill Odenkirk has lost a lot brownie points for this.
Give me the God damn kitty-cat bracelet!!!
One of the best Russian actors 👏
Song name rap ?
Nobody☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ super
Nobody☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ super
He's  John Wick
appear in the trailer  Producer of John wick    me :  Yes i can See That
John wick ?
Mike didn't know he played with fire when he threatened Saul
Better not call Saul.
The antagonist was underwhelming, and as much as I liked the movie, it should've been a bit longer.
Got to see this in theaters and it's now my new favorite action movie. And yes, that's over the Bourne, Wick and Mission Impossible films. All y'all dont sleep on Nobody it's well worth a trip to the theater!!
Better Call Saul in action  movie lol  i have to watch it ..!!
oh for fucks sake can it be something other than Russians...
Nobody has a name😍
I am so annoyed are they steal the kitty cat bracelet.
is this some kind of "the man from nowhere" family version??
You see, if I hadn't seen Breaking Bad I could've believed this character but he was so good at playing Saul it is seared into my mind and anything else he plays just seems weird to me. Great actor.
I just came from the cinema I watched it 😍 it was great movie and especially his father was very cool old man😂 i love it i I recommend it to everyone to watch it 👍🏻
ım gonnna sue you all...
'When you left, you abandoned some debt that needs repayment, and your creditor is aware of your resurrection.' This line of dialogue and the implied storyline isn't in the actual movie, despite the trailer insinuating that it is a major part of the plot. Frustrating. Good film though!
Slippin Jimmy back to his roots I see
Saul Wick
1:13 can someone tell me the name of that the bgm here?? Loved it!
John Wick is waay better
I must say it's really a good movie 👏👏👏 at first I thought it's boring but it was not  it's really worth it.
Glad to see bob getting some fame
Now it's because of a kitty "CAT" bracelet.
6.5/10  Movie started out good but then fell into the cliché overexaggerated cheesy shooting scenes in the end. This movie has been done before plenty of times, not what I was expecting.
Its all fun and games until he visits his dog's grave.
Okay....so the writers of John Wick...are writing a new john wick.....
JHON WICK REMAKE WITH JOKER SCENE AND dog is replaced with family dog=family here
This is NOT John Wick. This is the Brother of John Wick who gets his ass kicked all the time 🤣

ohh i taught all the focus is on Better Call Saul..not bad..looking forward seeing this
Movie was good!!! Go see
Who do you call when you are fighting deadly gangs
Please forgive my ignorance, I only know Christopher Lloyd in this movie. For other cast members, sorry, they're great actors, but I just don't know who they were. It's a pretty decent movie. I watched it yesterday afternoon.
“For twelve years I worked for some very dangerous people”  *Walter White would like to know your location
Walt: Skyler I AM the danger ! Skyler: What about Saul ?  Walt: Never mind
REFERENCES BREAKING BAD! AMAZING
It's the soundtrack for me especially when he's fighting......ambilimba ambilimba
esse vai ser filmão
Is this movie out???
I watched it today and I LOVE IT!!
Background music name ?
After watching this I swear I will not say anything to my father. Plot twist : he was the teacher of John Wick
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!
He is the Family type of John Wick
Better call Saul than Nobody
woah!
DUmbest action movie of the year. In the finale, theres this corny stand off with the Russian mob and Hutch's 80 year old father, standing shoulder to shoulder with his son. CORNY! Trashy, moronic ridiculous spoof
So ive been waitinf for this movie an it came out 2 months ago
when a working title just works...
plot twist its saul goodmans first trip on molly
Things you should never do Steal John Wick's car or Kill his dog  Steal her Kitty Cat bracelet  That shit gets you killed
wanted to see this saul in bb
...Spoiler Alert... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It would have been awesome if his brother who shows up at the end turned out to be Denzel’s character from the Equaliser.
John wick : you killed my dog, stole my car This guy: he stole my kitty kat bracelet
Basically the white equalizer 😂💀🤷🏽‍♂️
did i miss this film?
MR.SHOW ...BITCH ! I MUTHERFUKKIN LOVE BOB !!!
The self oppressed American Dad( reference to American Beauty)  who has a John Wick  moment because his son and neighbor looked down on him. The problem with the plot is that well prepared people do not bring danger at home.
Yep this movie is a mix of Taken and John Wick. Very good movie!
Home alone for dads
Nobody: In cinemas: now
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT!! Remember the old game Driver? They should make a real movie and make this guy John Tanner, he has that perfect raspy voice for it
1:11 Chancla be like:
So my siblings went. They just couldn't wait. They watched it yesterday and they liked it. Looks promising but aren't all trailers
THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!
So what is it ?! John Wick 4 ?!!
Holy shit!.. Now it made totally sense why Saul didn't get the hitmen Walt wanted.
The people played by Alexei Serebryakov, the russian mafia, is what the Russian government is made of today. "Bratki". Have no illusion!
sera que ja acho esse filme pra baixar?
Do I need to watch any other movie before this
The film is directed by Russian director Ilya Naishuller
0:41
We now have 2 new genres. Liam Neeson and John Wick.
Father of John Wick
Deserves a sequel with Harry and David.

My man looks like the fortnite sweat the kills the whole squad and gets a 30 bomb
I thought this movie was way better then John wick ...
Taken , the prequel?
👍🏻
It’s cool Christopher Lloyd is there
Nobody should waste there money and watch it... nobody
The most lamest movie I ever seen that I had to walk out and waste 40 dollars ... I was so disappointed 😞 😔... wow don't waste your money on this lame movie...and this was my first movie in about a whole year... im not lying either...walk in theaters... wow... the trailer looked good but the real movie was trash 🗑 😪 😕 🤧... the first movie i ever walked out of... the knife 🔪 went all the way in him and he took it out and never went to the hospital and put a band aid on it... he should of been leaking like air out of a tire...
Better not caul Saul, for it will end poorly for you.
epic triple collat at 2:37 🥵
Watched this today 🔥🔥 loved it.
this movie was insane
I've just finished watching this film and I enjoyed it. I hope this film will be made into a series like John Wick.
Kitty Cat bracelet 😭😭😭
Its like movie producers are copying the homework of the producers of john wick but try not to make it obvious they copied
oh man gota design a GTA art for this
Thumbnail picture is look like another John Wick movie
Any tell bgm name at 1:12
It's all good man..
It looks like John wick 😅😅 but this is amazing
Were the shirtless scene,i need that💥
John Wick:  finally a worth opponent                                Our battle will be legendary
ബാലുശ്ശേരി സന്ധ്യയിൽ നിന്ന് ട്രൈലർ കണ്ട്ഇഷ്ടായി വന്നു
This might be a long stretch, but there could be a very small chance this is Nobody from TMNT. I can only hope this is a TMNT reboot but I'd be only lying to myself
John Wick. If the wife didn't die, this is what John Wick life will be.
Im so happy for Bob he is trully an amazing actor that needs more recognition.
Sounds like an alternate version of John Wick like 100%
Just saw this movie and it’s even better than the trailer could prepare me for.
Saul "BADMAN".
I watch this movie its soooo good

Kinda looks like that lawyer from TV
To the directors: Please don't mix John Wick with this.
Almost as bad ass as threat level midnight
Please make a review of the first Russian blockbuster "Major Grom: The Plague Doctor" on the superhero theme. I think it turned out well!
His daughters face when the basement door is closing.... " my dad's gonna fxck you up. "
Walt used to be the danger now saul is the danger and a threat to john wick
John Wick Universe
If John Wick really have a Family
The rotten refund unusually correct because cyclone normally tie into a adjoining mustard. envious, grubby gruesome ounce
Why his voice is so different than he was in Breaking Bad. As if another person.
JOHN WICK+FAMILY - SERIOUSNESS=NOBODY
Clever girl
LIke that western "My name is nobody" :D About the movie, another action film, like hundreds...
I guess this is the new life saul chose when he vanished
Jhon wick : "You killed my Dog" Nobody : "Give me the dam kitty cat right now"
I legit thought that was Rick Grimes from Walking Dead in the thumbnail... who else thought the same or is it just me? 👀
Better call John
The boogeyman!? John wasn’t exactly the boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the boogeyman!  Okayyy so nobody was the boogeyman huh! John probably killed him loll.
Everyone we gotta get that god damn kitty cat braclet
did they just give away the entire story
Just saw it in theaters and loved it.
I don't want john wick to be replaced by this bs( the move looks cool btw)
Its very similar to John Wick in a lot of ways, but it embraces that and goes overboard (same director)
Same universe as John Wick?
I never knew that John Wick's brother is a nobody!
Did anyone called Saul yet?
This Flick is fookin’ great! YNWA
This is the most generic shit I've ever seen, white noise in trailer form
Cant want to watch this  ..."The John Wick Movie in the meantime!"......while J.Wick 4 awaits in 2022....
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl_pxCAcJz4
If u haven't watched this movie u need 2 asap 💥💥💥💥💥
jiimmy finally found a good life
We saw the trailer this morning and we went and watched it this afternoon, absolutely fantastic movie! If you don't like it I feel sorry for your taste in movies
official trailer of the person who asked
Woooooow
'John Wick vs Nobody': 🔥🔥😀😀❤️ nuf said!
help with the song running in background .. ?
Yet another movie with middle age men fantasy. I will watch it for sure :)
If something'weird in your neighborhood, who're you gonna call? Saul goodman!
Bob is gonna be up there. A real bankable.
Say Jon Wick and I'm ready to watch
Pulls out gun bullets drop   Everyone on bus:......  Suburban dad: IM Gonna fuck you up
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET !!!
John Wick 5
This trailer is such a spoiler. If you didn't start the trailer yet, just watch the movie first and thank me later.
I watched this today and I enjoyed it so much! Strongly recommended! :)
Its all due to the kitty cat bracelet
what is the song from 01:13 ?
Anyone know what website you can watch this on? Usually don't have a problem with websites I use to watch movies in theaters but this one isn't on them for some reason
"Better call Hutch Mansell" should be the tagline of the movie...
1:12  Song ?❤️
I know a guy, who knows a guy named Nobody
The utopian building curiosly rely because crop culturally record times a absorbing relish. eager, axiomatic meter
Finally went back to the movie theater today.  Great popcorn flick.  Bob O is the best.  Hope they make a sequel with dad and bro.  Go watch it.
good movie
This is what happens when John Wick isn't available
Discount John Wick
Lame
What film
Do yall know who the Russian chick is in the black suit thingy? I am curious as to who the actor is
Breaks ng bad Lawyer?  Saul!
Is it on Netflix ???
Looks like John Wick! I am gonna watch this.
I might have over corrected 🤣
John Wick is now a genre
abit too similar to john wick lol
It looks good, too bad they showed all of the good parts for free in the trailer, it hardly seems worth paying to see the rest now.
The movie is fantastic! I can watch it over and over again!
Can't stream or rent this anywhere online. IMMA PIRATE THE SHIT OUT OF THIS I GUESS... fuck you universal
This is just about the whole movie.
This trailer may as well show the whole movie
just read and article of a possible crossover John Wick and Nobody .... that would be insane !!!
Ghost Rider 3 official trailer : https://youtu.be/_STFLOxFyDU
Jon Wicks older brother
Please don't book the judge by its cover
When I saw poster I thought it is a parody of John wick
he looks like he might know a guy or two
I like the background song so much I watch this trailer for that background nobody
Better Call Nobody.
Great movie I just watched it in theaters I definitely recommend it
Damn! I am watching this tonight!
Did Thomas Jane turn this role down? Its got a huge Punisher vibe to it.
Awesome 👏
Just saw the movie today and as a hardcore fan of John Wick, it WAS AWESOME! The vibe was different and I enjoyed every second of it. I loved the soundtrack, the cinematography, the humor, the grit, the action, etc. It had everything I wanted 10/10 for me
I cannot wait to see this. Looks fucking amazing!
Storywise, it may be a generic action movie and feel like Better Call Saul and John Wick blended together, but the action in this movie is awesome, and Bob Odenkirk was awesome. The guy is versatile and talented
I've never seen anything like it
So I expect Nobody 2 and Nobody 3, because we all know Leitch can make a damn good trilogy which is evident with John Wick lmao.
Is this a well made John Wicked's parody?
I think they shoulda kept his old “job” a secret. I feel like they just revealed the entire plot in this trailer. ( people think Guy is average —> not really average b/c past —> villain “awakens” something —> pow pow punch punch —> John Wick 4)
I’m thinking this will be a collab were John Wick and him are buddy’s and live in the same universe.
This is the sequel to breaking bad !
Award.
Not used to seeing this guy as a badass

A piece of amazing. This is too good.

Breaking bad
Same time old theme , but this really pulls it off well. One of the best we have seen in a long while. We thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it.
SAUL WICK HOMIE!!!
"Better Call John Wick"...

Dont call 911😁😁
Funny how ALL the villains, every single one of them had to be played by a white man. :) So this is equality and diversity? To portray a group of people in a collectively bad light based on their skin color? So woke and progressive, wow. :)
We figured out who asked
Don't Fuk with the wrong guy!!!
This is the exact moment Saul Goodman turned into Saul Badman
Song name
Watched it today, awesome movie
cant believe how great the Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo sequel
just saw it. that scene, where he rolls the grenade down the hallway is not in the movie...or rather, they replaced it with a mason jar.
Gozilla is better
Good character for rorschach 😊
I think we'd all wade through blood to get your kids favourite bracelet back.   just to stop the whining. :)
Shame this guy only put it in theatres DURING A LITERAL PANDEMIC so many ppl wouldve paid to stream it
so basically its a funnier version of John Wick?
Cat !!
This happen When John Wick’s child raise by Jack Reacher...

Who else thought this was a John wick parody comedy movie? The poster is literally the parody of John wick’s chapter 2 poster but except for guns, it’s fists. Who the fuck designed the poster?

I love how every thing stated because the kitty cat bracelet
This movie might get me back into a theater.
So a couple days ago i was listening to ESPN radio and one of the guys said that they had gone to the movies and saw this. He said that the Lawyer from Breaking Bad is in this movie and it is GREAT!!! He did throw in that this isnt a kids movie too. I just now remembered about it and here i am. Lol.

That cop is the same cop from John whick

The older John Wick!

Isn’t he the Saul the lawyer? Lmao

0:28   I had to look again to make sure that he wasn't drinking from a Wexler McGill mug.
I saw the movie.  I half-expected him to pick up the phone, call for a "dinner reservation," and pull out a stack of gold coins.
Saul is no more a GOODman
Saul fucking people up, entertainment at it's  finest
Unloads revolver and the empty shell noise is before the bullets hit the ground.... And why do they sound empty? Hollywood really sucks with gun stuff...

John Wick multiverse ! Pleaseee 🤩
If John Wick’s wife made it and they had a family...
Now days everyones the fucking danger
Is It Me Or This Movie Had Been Out On Multiple Apps And Now They Wanna Put It In Theater’s
It's funny, when, (if I ever will that is) I get into a fight, I always thought I'd say, "I'm gonna f**k you up". Lol. Even if I'm the little guy...
this movie was actually really good. If you haven’t watched it yet, I’d recommend it.
This is a what if, John Wick actually starts a family.
*YAWN* Tedious Empty Violence Grates.
John wick :All i did bcoz for My puppy and you copied me  Nobody:i did it for My kitty kat bracelet,well do you know who killed your wife John wick :I dont know who killed My wife but i killed many mafias Nobody:At least i know whos threatening My family LOL🤣
"Don't drink and drive.But if you do,call me."-Saul Goodman Lol
They came for John Wick's dog and now they come for nobody's kitty cat bracelet.
main theme : whats happens when john wick didnt lose his wife
is this a breaking bad sequel?
Oh, and it's also not funny. The trailer is very misleading.
Great movie, if you like zero character development and plot holes the size of Montana. Sheesh. What an eyeroll-apalooza. Literally felt like the screenwriter had a checklist: vintage-y 60-ish music, yeah, I like that, but in the chase scene, gotta have some good old 80's era Pat Benatar, token rapper, yeah RZA needs to be in this somehow, never mind actually writing a character for him, hmmm Christopher Lloyd hasn't done anything in a while, let me write a nothing part for him, just give him some guns and let him loose, and Russians, gotta have those evil, vengeful Russians (who mysteriously hang out with Latinos and Americans, ok, whatever, that's some street gang you got there, only in the movies....) I read scripts for a living and this one would have been chucked so far out of the pile...damn...I need a new line of work if this is what writers, producers and audiences think is up to par these days.
I’ll better call Saul😬
Keanu Reeves: John Wick-The "Baba Yaga" Denzel Washington: Robert McCall- The Equalizer Ben Affleck: Christan Wolff-The Accountant Tom Cruise: Jack Reacher And now Bob Odenkirk: Hutch Mansell-The Nobody  Really liked this movie! Would recommend ^^
He is ruthless 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫 I was mad at him in the beginning for being so soft ....but wow he is BAD A**
“I know your boss sent you here...but you gotta know when to say no”😆
going to watch the movie tonight in theatres during Covid I'll let you know how it goes
Tom Cruise
The vibe of the movie was so different compared to other movies
SO HOLLYWOOD AND OUR POLITICIANS KEEP JUMPING ON THE GUN CONFISCATION BANDWAGON EVERYTIME THERES A SHOOTING YET THEIR ALL FINE CONTINUING TO PUMP OUT ALL THIS NON-SENSICAL AND OVER THE TOP VIOLENCE IN MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES, THEY ARE THE ONES DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE DEAD FROM GUN VIOLENCE.
i saw this and instantly thought of two movie franchises, fast & furious and john wick
This is what happens after BB and BCS. You can see the WM cup (wexler,mcgill)
2:36 No scope
So basically John wick
GOOD MOVIE!!!
So this like another version of John wick😒
Who the fuck are you? I'm Saul Goodman! Better Call Saul!
I heard Louis Prima,  Already got tickets to see it tonight
Too much info in the trailer. It's like the CliffNotes of the whole movie. Don't watch this, just go see it.

I’m currently on the final season for breaking bad.  So fresh memories I thought it would be hard to see this guy be a bad ass killer in a action movie.  But this trailer completely made me forgot who Saul Goodman is.  Can’t wait to check it out!!!
So...Death Wish without Paul Kersey.
Yes! Finally something to go see. Going tonight! 🍿

Excellent! Plus the title, like A Few Good Men, sets up the inevitable joke: "Hey, what did you do this weekend?" "I saw nobody." "Oh, what an interesting life you have!"
That fucking nobody is..........

What's in theaters in 2021 during a pandemic? Nobody.
I liked it but I hate that they are still editing so much out from trailer to final cut. So f'n annoying.
The director did Kung Pow: Enter the Fist Now he is doing this....
I saw🤓 the jocker spirt🤡 flying in the bus 🚌
Almost same scenario as John Wick
This trailer gives the whole movie away
I saw this movie yesterday it’s soo entertaining 🤗 a great distraction during this hard time
I saw this movie last night. I've never watched "Breaking Bad" or "Better Call Saul" so I am unfamiliar with the characters that he's played. The movie was a joyride, a violent nutty one, but so well done. It was almost as if Tarantino had a hand in it, but not. Most of the action scenes were like an opera. The cameras were placed everywhere, while music played, and the action was fluid.  Without getting all "critic" about it, it wasn't just unpredictable in some ways, but again, so well orchestrated. Reminded me of The Kingsman's action sequences.  There are a lot of nobodies out there, and this movie unleashed one of the nuttiest version.  So, I'm open to questions.
Secret? He trained John Wick
Satire truth of life, not just a movie, essentially fight club 2.
at 2:05, his stash includes an 1867 grill and an 1869 pictorial. the man knows his stamps.
I thought this was a John wick parody
Dont call 911 you better call saul
So does this take place after el Camino?
It's nice to see Kevin Costner kicking some ass
Nobody:  Nobody:
You better give him that goddamn kitty cat bracelet.
I cannot imagine this being any less awesome than it looks.
I know John Wick was a big hit and this seems very good but it seems a bit redundant to make another retired "I can kill anyone." guy movie.
This is like in the same universe than Jhon wick, imagine a crossover between this two!! Hahaha
So marshal Ericksons boss has gone crazy lol
John Wick as a dad
That f***ing NOBODY is JOHN WICK
Just saw the movie yesterday and it was lit. You can see another version of John wick with a lot to laugh. And a lot of newly packed actions ❣️. Loved it❣️❣️❣️
Over corrected 😝
John wick fights for his wife's dog and Saul fights for his daughter’s kittykat bracelet. That’s what I’m talking about.
Is this movie available on torrent?
I’m a simple man, when I see a Bob Odenkirk movie’s out, I’ll watch it without asking questions.
Nice 🍿
"S'all bad man"
Better Call Saul S5: E8 Bagman, Remember when Saul goes to meet Lalo and in a conversation when he ask him to collect 7million and says to Saul that you're NOBODY..😂
Buried rage is a real thing. You gotta let that crap out every day.....or  _this_ is what happens. 😳
So it's literally Jhon Wick but... Bob Odenkirk?
John Wick: "They killed my dog." Nobody: "Hold my daughter's kitty cat bracelet."
"From the director of John Wick"? So I'm hearing we could potentially see this guy bump shoulders with John in chapter 4?
I just watched it in theaters with my wife. We both loved the movie and it’s combination of action with a little bit of comedy. I would watch again!

What is the  name of the song at 1:12?
So they reshot John Wick with new actors? cool I guess
If john wick is not available Better call saul
The end picture with all the fists in his face look like all  the guns in John Wick's face image..
I just watched it without watching the trailer, it was so crazy. One of the best movies I’ve seen in a while
Absolutely fantastic movie
Just watched this it was fyee
"I once convinced Kevin Costner that I was John Wick and it worked because *I* believed it!"
If they don't build this and John Wick into a cinematic universe type deal it'd be a missed opportunity
Just seen it. Now I just Can't wait to add it to my collection! It's definitely up there with John wick and the equalizer movies!!!

Just saw movie. It's great entertainment. Loved it. Just the right amount of humor and plenty of action.
i took the kitty cat bracelet....oh no....  really looking forward to seeing this movie
I went and saw this today and I think it’s better than all the John wick movies combined watch it it’s amazing
The man John Wick fears
Twist is that the entire movie is taking place in Michael's head as a script for Threat Level Midnight
2:04 It'd be so cool that he's also a former member of The Continental that tried to leave but got sucked back in like John Wick
February 26 of which year?
Off brand John wick
Did they really just try and copy John wick? 😂😂😂
Yea it’d be nice if I could actually fucking watch this movie. Way to only release it in theaters when all the fucking theaters are closed.. no possible way to stream it or even dl it. Shits not on Pirate Bay or nothing... I’m not even gonna watch it on hbo max. I’ll only illegally watch this movie now because fuck you assholes for making it impossible to watch
should play a corrupted lawyer lol
It said February then it said march
Best trailer ever!!
I wanna watch this
Is he the bogeyman
finally Saul learned smth from Mike!!!!
This is the moment Saul Goodman became Heisenberg
This is the moment Saul became Heisenberg
I can't wait to see this! Love the line "I'm gonna fuck you up" and the poor little girl "they stole my kitty cat bracelet" :( who does that! Looks like they get what they deserve for taking her bracelet. Haha.
I just cant imgaine him being a hitman. His SAUL. The lawyer
Old john wick
Is this some kind of john wick parody? Or are they serious?
Isn't this literally the script of John Wick?! Except that his wife is alive!
Holy fuck this is probably better than the John wick trilogy combined
This looks really good.

Please let john wick and the nobody be in the same universe
Don't call 911  Call Saul Goodman 🙄 🤣😂🤣🤣
So it's John wick
i just saw it IS FANTASTIC
"JOHN WICK UNIVERSE" aniticipated.
Man, the old guys are the one who’s kicking ass 🔥🔥
Was this directed by the guy who also did Hardcore Henry?
magnificent! just came from the theatre....i could see it again tonight! Love Bob O!
This guy is a better nobody than Rey from Star Wars
Man....this looks like it's gonna be good!
Just watched it and it was really good can’t wait tell #2
Just saw this movie today. Loved it
Just watched it on its first day. Well done! Great rare masculine entertainment.
Just saw it, will see it again. Action, humor, music, family love. Hero's a bad guy/good guy. Never one dull moment. Like others, I loved it!!!
I just got back from seeing this film. It was great, I loved it, Bob Odenkirk worked damned hard for this role and he really really deserves kudos
Spoiler: Everyone dies at the end.
Bob Odenkirk is...  Decker
This is the plot of A History Of Violence?
Odysseus b like
word so saul wick? im in.
your hatred towards masculinity is toxic.
The Papa Yaga
2:58 *Ahem*... Dat Odenkirkian ass! You're welcome, fellow ladies!
Good to see he’s doing well and quit law
This is a movie worth seeing!!
So this is the "fucking Nobody"?
dope & kick ass
This is what happens when somebody claims 25 or god-forbid, 46 is the highest number.
Saul decided practicing law wasn't for him.
Finally after all the small roles he gets a chance
Now thats a triple kill one bullet @2:38
This feels like a rehash. History of Violence, John Wick, Taken...
This movie is a joke right?
2:37 TRIPLE COLLAT
I love Bob odenkirk❤️
They showed all good scenes in trailer theres nothing left for movie lol
Me after i watched this movie  In a train telling bunch of bad guys  I'm gona f u up  Opens his eyes in a hospital on a strecher

Well, the movie's out now. Also, I've realized that one of the producers of this film has my first name!
John Wick v. Nobody.   Make it happen, people.
😂😂😂😂 better call Saul Wick 😂😂😂😂
I guess I'll watch Bob Odenkirk as a kill-crazy action man, nothing is throwing me yet
Saw it last night, and it's so much. fun. Bought a ticket for Saturday while the credits were rolling.
Thousands of Nobodies been waiting for this.
If Saul and mike switched places in life
I would never ever steal a kitty cat bracelet in my life
Loveeeeeeeed the movie 🍿 10/10
1:00 the masterpiece !
This looks too cartoonish. Charles Bronson in 'Death Wish' (1974) is some real gritty action/drama.
Heisenberg could take him.
Just got back from the Theaters!!! ITs fuking funny as hell!!! I loved it!!! 10/10 Christopher LLoyd is fucking EPIC!!!
Sorry, this just doesn't look believable...at all.
John Wick parody ??
I saw movie. I am very picky when rating movies but 5 Stars. Action laughter lol John Wicks Brother Cousin for Sure!!!!
Looks like another awesome film
Queen of Themyscira, pretending to be a housewife.
F**king bad ass
Before Boogeyman there is Nobodyman
"Mom can we get john wick?"  "We have john wick at home"  John wick at home:
"Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet!!" 😂😂😂 never piss off a dad. Also we need to see a crossover with John wick. These two would be the baddest badasses ever in the action movie genre.
Hate that some cool scenes were spoiled looks ok for film.
John Wick meets Walter White 🤘😂
Why does this trailer look like a mashup of John Wick and equalizer?😅
In tekken they kidnapped Liam Nesson’s daughter  In John Wick they killed John Wick’s puppy  But.....  In this movie they did the worse you could possibly do.....  THEY STOLE THE F**KING KITTY CAT BRACELET
as long as he says god dammit once i wil watch
All is good man!
director of hardcore henry and saul goodman... alright im sold
I definitely need to see him go against John Wick...
naishuller directed this movie, hes also lead singer in the band biting elbows which are sick if anyones interested
Its nobody nobody but you... Clap clap 👏👏👏...
Didnt Charles Bronson and Liam Neeson make this movie at least 3 times each in the past years? Odenkirk is always watchable, but seems like the same old revenge plot. Of course I am nonetheless eagerly awaiting seeing it !
you better not call saul
so this guy is gonna get called back to finally take down john wick and they will end up teaming u together. looks sort of like an obvious setup to me
Huge fan of Odenkirk for essentially putting Tim and Eric on the map, then his amazing role as Goodman. Him starring this is strange but delightful to say the least! Can't wait! I stan for Odenkirk
Spiderman is an executive producer?
Will now we know what happens to Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad
So it's basically "what if Dad was an ex-hitman?"
The moment Saul Goodman became Badman
I’m happy to see Ilya Naishuller back into directing again
Now that's hardcore action
2:47 "He said it! He said it!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mYLi3PGOc
Tomorroooowwww🔥🔥🔥
Don't call 911    Call Saul
Ngl kinda faschi
He's the real John Wick. That fucking NOBODY is John Wick
This should be his new identity after Saul Goodman.
oh shit it comes out tomorrow.
Looks like a lot of legal trouble...better call Saul!
I'm  dying to see this, hurry up please, i need to see this now, not June! Arghhhhh!
So this is John Wick when he retired and they still coming after him?  :)
This is the moment bob odenkirk became kevin costner .
Song name?
Just wooooow what a trailer man. I can't wait to see the movie
Theres so many of these movies now that play to the fantasy of just getting angry and fucking up anyone you don't like
1:14 song name???
no walt it’s over when I say it’s over
saul gon get jesse back for the beating in his office
When is it coming out?
1:13 music name please ???
Sadly this nobody is going to be watched by everybody..😅🤣😂
Was Liam Neeson already booked?
1.16 what is the full song
F word in trailer? Yes
Damn, I'm glad Saul settled down in the John wick Universe.  Omaha was shit. (sorry)
0:59  Bob Odenkirk (WhatShallWeDoNext Member): I’m Gonna F*** You Up Trollers. YFGA Members and Imposters and Scammers: (Laughs)

This trailer just gave up the plot...!!!
It's just john wick but probably shittier
Alternate universe where John Wicks song is never killed and the Russians attack this guy
So this is John Wick 2077 - Senescence
What's the name of song at 1:12?
Nobody:  Nobody:
I would be happy if it's from same john wick universe
wow this is an original story
The audio mixing is REALLY good in this trailer
dont call 911 😎😎
I watched a tv show looked like this exactly
Song?
anything with christopher loyd ill be watching
I have a particular set of skill...i can john wick mode ^o^
😂😂and what's with the bollywood vibe I'm hearing Movie looks promising!!!
This movie has been done so many times. This is every Liam Neeson, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood and so on movie, where angry man isn't angry enough and so of he gets angry again, this time with guns and grit, he can stop all bad things from happening to his family.
Initially I though "Nice... this has some Falling Down vibe to it." but a few moments later "*sigh* just another BS hollywood action movie."
Never thought I'd need to see an action movie with Bob Odenkirk... but I need to see this so bad!
Who after watching bhavani punch style in this movie
So another john wick movie
Waiting for "The Auditor" to meet "The boogeyman" now
Looks like Saul Goodman got tired of getting kicked around.
This is the moment Walter became Heineken
Another John Wick
Just goes to show, when the story is as implausible as this, ANY actor can be put in the role and we'll believe they are badass.  Course, I love Bob and so will enjoy this nonsense for sure...
give me the goddamm kitty kat bracelet llooll
When liam Neeson no longer doing movies.. haha
You got me at the trailer. Now I'm hooked. Bad ass Saul Goodman!
In the The opening the police radio “unit 14 clear” that’s sampled in a rap sing from the 90s can’t remember which tho
So... Basically, alternate future John Wick? Wife lives, starts family, but still can't escape his past. A cameo would be awesome.
This movie looks great. John Wick has raised the bar in the genre.
I only know this guy from breaking bad

A Saul Goodman power fantasy
This is horrible when writers and directors have no creativity but to take bits and pieces of ideas of movies and implement in their own because they truly suck at thinking at creating a good movie without taking from others....you have from John Wick, Tom Cruse Jack Reacher and possibly  the accountant  as well.....no vision if you have to take tid bits from different movies......
Better call Saul? Is this the lawyer Saul in Breaking Bad?
someone seems to have called saul
tbh this movie im hype for
So he tries to use anything but Guns? Very NOT John Wick!
Nah, you can't just take John Wick, throw out John Wick, and expect to get another best movie ever. It hurts to watch the same idea with a comic scent to it. That should've been worked on better. 🤷
I’m so use to seeing Bob Odenkirk in comedies. Seems weird seeing him in a action flick but does look good
So, it's John Wick meets Deathwish?
Watched it tonight. It's the lovechild of John Wick and Deadpool. Off the walls orgasmic action sequences with knee-slapping hilarity. I'd watch it right now again if I could. 10/10 don't miss this people!!!!!
what is bernd leno doing here.
Is this technically in the John wick universe? Seems like it tbh
Saul having a knife pulled on him while he drops the bullets to “fuck them up” over just shoot them is wonderful
Русские режиссёры тоже могут)))
looks so damn good. omg . i have to see this movie
0:59 I’m gonna fuck you up
I love how all the comments are Saul Goodman ones 🤣 this is the only other thing I could watch Bob oden Kirk play
Awesome.
Breaking Bad Sequel
Better call saul!
im confused it says in theaters only march 26th does this imply that this will be a one day limited movie?
john wick's brother
Just out of curiosity, how many dead bodies as a result of people going to movie theaters to watch this movie are you cool with?
Damn they really showed the Gene scene from season 6 early
sweet trailer definatly gonna watch
Meanwhile the other universe of John Wick..
Slippin Jimmy
Awesome
Imagine a crossover between John Wick and this guy
An action movie with a personality,definitely watching this

"In theaters only February 26th." "In Theaters Only March 26th."
So...That's what he really learned at the "Men's university of American Samoa"
Okay can I just say how dope it be if this was in the same universe as John Wick tho.

Ohkay but is it on hulu ? Netflix ?  Amazon prime ?
Damn in theaters only? Really :(
"Winston Deavor, you sneaky bastard!"  Does Evelyn know you're a low-key super hero?,...
He’s John Wick but with a family
Remeber,  Before someone killed John Wick's dog, and Before someone stole the kitty cat some idiot had the idea of . . . . . . . . . . . . killing doom slayer's bunny
Love the Breaking Bad and Better call Saul comments lol

Русские, вы согласны, что нас изображают такими скотами, не только американцы, но и родные режиссёры?????????????????????????????????????
Cеребряков мог бы сыграть и получше или это видение режиссёра??????? Хотя последний тоже русский. Для американцев мы всегда останемся такими СВОЛОЧАМИ?????? : "Прости меня за мой ответ: и всё-таки: НЕТ!"
I found this movie by looking up “kitty bracelet movie”
Well just saw the whole movie in the trailer so no need to see it at the theatre now, thanks !

Saul relax
Don't call 911, better call Saul..

Saul Goodman.. ain’t nobody 🥃👌🏽
Don't take his kitty cat bracelet
This looks good but is this a spoof of John wick
2020: lalo scared the shit out of saul. saul in 2021: i am gonna get your a** lalo.
Класс!
John wich but not john wick cause he kills for a stolen kitty cat breclet not a stolen car
Awesome movie, truly; loved it, didn't expect he would do such a roll and actually be good at it.
Not Saul Goodman: "They came after my family." Not Saul Goodman's daughter: "They stole my kitty cat bracelet." Not Saul Goodman: "And you don't fucking do that! " Not Saul Goodman "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY BRACELET.".
Oh yeah
just a john wick/ equalizer copycat.
God damn Artillery Arthur came a long way.
then there is that horses*** Equalizer trailer....geez...
What's the non English part of the trailer song?
Saul Wick , or John Goodman?
Looks sick! Can't wait.
2:37 AWP 1 shot 3 kills
Nobody sounds like a thrilling mixture of 1993's Falling Down and 2005's action thriller A History of Violence.
Polyphemus has moved to the moon, he has decided not to take any chances.
This is the same amazing bastard that wrote for SNL...he wrote the character "Man Down By The River" for Chris Farley...way to go Bob!!
Discount john wick*
It's really good worth it..
I can describe this move in one meme...     AAAUUUGH AAAUUUGH CALL AN AMBULANCE... BUT NOT FOR ME *cocks pistol*
come one man,something new,it's the same john wick crap!
Imagine if Jimmy McGill got sick of being a lawyer. in  Breaking Bad and he would of  turned out like this working for Gus along side The Cleaner
Фильм ахеренный! 10/10!! Hello from Russia!)))
His wife in the movie is just what Walter needed in Breaking Bad.
John wick if he had a family?
"Call 911, but not for me"   - Saul Goodman
Bottom-line..Don't mess with people's pets in any way, shape or form.
Anyone else getting john wick flash backs
"in theaters only"? are you slow?!
We gonna see a cameo my guy John wick at the end
Looks like it’s part of the John Wick universe with thise gold bars.  Hoping for a crossover.
Great. Watched the entire film from the trailer.
This 6th season of “better call saul” trailer is lit af.
Plot twist: he is John Wicks teacher
Finally I watched it in the cinema in Egypt. And the performances of Bob Odenkirk was terrific and so good. I'm waiting for part 2 next year.
Yupp, i'm watching this
Looks like Saul got tired of being a lawyer & decided to become a somebody instead of nobody lol
such long trailers ruin it for me
Οὖτις ἐμοί γ᾽ ὄνομα
What is the song playing @1:27 ? Any idea
Looks a dozen times better than John Wick
I love the concept and good enough trailer but i think it would be better if they cut out 1:21-2:43.
its like the same thing of john wick story
Can anyone tell me the name of the background song
Can anyone suggest me how to download this movie
Hh better call saül
Hey it’s Rorschoch
Who are the 3k *&^%$%&*$$#@ that didn't like it
Just watched it. Awesome!!! Action 10/10. Music 10/10. Humor 10/10. Really like it. Want to see it second time))
Looks like a john wick rip-off

track?
He looks like he can be a lawyer and help meth king
Guess life at the Cinnabon got kinda rough!
It says February 26th at the end of trailer but it’s for March 26 right ?
Don't worry , it's all good man!
https://youtu.be/c_5h212kIms
nice..
I just saw it .. waste of time and money.. not nearly as good as the trailer.. pure 💩
The High Table is watching.
Wow. What a trailer. Action Mind-blowing, Looking forward to releasing in India want to watch on the big screen.
This is a unofficial remake of indian movie Baasha(1995). Bloody Hollywood,can't think original.
The film is shot by the Russian director ...quite a precedent though Ilya Nayshuller.
IMHO, 0:58, I think if the actor is Andrew Lincoln(rick grimes on the walking dead), it became more badass
Вчера посмотрел. Не много не то что ожидал, Уик неполучился но история хорошая. В целом - хорошо. За наших плюс :)
You don't want a criminal lawyer... you want a "criminal" lawyer
looks great
Damn you Ozzy Man, now I have to find somewhere to watch this !!!!  Stoopid covid...
ngl the start was lookin like an arthritis commercial
Thought this was a Fallout movie made by Bethesda or something
Да, я тоже от поперечного
I just saw the movie and its a masterpiece man
Everyone's a gangsta until the day Saul tells Mike “Fine, I'll do it my self”.
Looks... kinda dumb
you’re not nobody you’re saul goodman
POV: you didn’t call Saul
When I saw the thumb I suspected a Payback kind of thing. Close enough...👍
Saul Wick
This looks cool. But I feel like the story would have been better if he actually was a nobody. Not some retired super assassin. If he was someone who had to learn all his skills on the fly and adapt. The "retired assassin starts killing again" story has been done so many times now.  Also, obligatory "I guess he better call Saul" joke.

This is my comment. please "Do Not Call 911."  Because I am NOBODY.
give my the kitty can bracelet
OZZYMAN bring me here...
saul is that you
Ай факин лав ит, так сказатб
damn, I hope the theaters open again soon
2:37 " *TRIPLEEE KEEELL* "
It looks like it could have been good but I wish I hadn't seen the trailer as it seems like the whole point of the movie is that nobody knows who he is and now we do so now its just another action movie. Probably won't bother now.
1:13 that 3 punches scene could have been better, looks very unrealistic, better acting was needed
AAAAAWYEAAAAA
A history of violence on steroids?🤔. Looks good.
Who else just heard about this because of Ozzy man reviews?
The title must be a reference to that line from John Wick about "He's a ... nobody! That... nobody is John Wick"
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
"I wish they pick my place ya know ✊✊✊"  SHUT UP STEVE NO YOU WOULDN'T!!
Haha
Give me the god damn kitty bracelet 🤣😂😂...
LOOKING TOP PNP SLAMMER POZ
✊💪
That is the worst movie poster that I have ever seen!
Can't wait to see if he gets the kitty cat bracelet back.
John wick 4?
It’s kinda like gta 5 Michael goes from a life of crime to family man
February 26, March 26. JUST GIVE ME THIS MOVIE ALREADY, or i fck you up!
Breaking bad is back
When better call saul gets tired of your shit jesse
Nice. Finally a family guy with guns. Must watch.
And this was directed by a russian guy)
Cheap John wick.☹️
So I’m guessing an auditor is someone who shows signs that’s your are going to die with out actually saying so
The difference between him and John Wick is that nobody has more to lose then John, this will be interesting
John Wick:Nobody(Im Nobody), John Wick:The Family, John Wick: Legacy. John Wick when he falls in love again and has a kid (family), but the past follows him, tries to escape and and tries to save his new family. He is the child( Boogeyman, Nobody)of John Wick as an adult, has a family, follows in his father's footsteps and seeks revenge for his father(if John Wick dies). But who knows, John Wick is baba yaga.
What is the theme song?
Just give him the kitty cat bracelet.
BTEC John Wick - more or less the same kind of story line
Pre John Wick, I would’ve thought this looks like another action movie based in an alternate reality where tactics and training doesn’t exist. Post John Wick, hell yeah!
nobody : .. me : Better call Saul lmao
Better call Wick
They actually shot some part of the movie at my house. Pretty cool seeing it now.
Love the music choice! It really fits the character’s flat narration mixed with the comedically outstanding level of violence
Does anybody know what song is playing during the bus scene?
"What is happening?!?!"  "It's all good, man" :)
Can’t wait to see this 🤞🏾
Seeing this next week!
Do u like the movie?  I wanna watch in cinema
Saul Badman... cool
Maybe this is same universe as John wick ????
To me this is movie feels like a fusion between John Wick and Joe Somebody.....I got feeling nobody knows what that movie is😅🤣
Now he looks like Joel from the last of us
My favorite director of all time!! Im so excited for this
And this, kids, is why he's called Artillery Arthur.
The song. Please anyone?
It's all good man....Saul Goodman is a badass killer now....just wowww
Better Call Swol
I need to see this movie 🔥
When you call Saul
*Plot Twist*     Hutch Mansell (Bob’s character) was one of the targets John Wick needed to assassinate to complete his “impossible task”
dont you fucking dare touch my kitty cat
This is where Gene Takavic ends up in
ও ভাই খেলা হবে😘
Wait...he was an auditor...that means the same people in John Wick who come to tell you that u don't have long to live.... right?
Bob is the best!
john wicks dad
"Who are you?" "I'm Saul Badman"
The music after he destroys the bus thugs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀
2:53 "Im a dream, a bomb...." Lmao
This looks good. Is... is this.... a GOOD MOVIE? IN 2021?  A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one!

This movie looks awesome!
I'm Mr, Mr nobody
I just love movies like The Equalizer, John Wick, Taken and probably this one too!
John wick from Wal-Mart
Ok, I wanna see this.
Feb 26 or march 26
lets appreciate how much the camera is pulled back and steady to show the action.
A man has no name.
Wait, if Bob Odenkirk is in this what does it mean for the last season if Better Call Saul !? I'm jonesing for new episodes
Damn saul came a very long way after being a lawyer didn't work out for him.
This is Jimmy McGill’s life after taking care of the guy who noticed him at the mall
honestly dont buy him winning the fight on the bus ngl, its funny how unrealistic this shit is lmao
I love it
When This Movie Realese..?? 2020 or 2021
This is John's Wick dad
Watching BCS and then seeing this trailers is 🤌🤌🤌
When John Wick and Taken have a baby
Can’t decide if this is awful or hilarious!
And this is how Saul became Saulsenberg
everything will remain the same ... that is what is said. Do not worry.
Best hitman west of the Mississippi
Er...didnt they make this same movie a while ago with that guy from the lord of the rings film??
They stole his daughter's kitty cat bracelet  It was a declaration of open warfare
From now...  Better call nobody!
Nobody:  Youtube comments:
Omg
Equalizer/nobody/john wick crossover?
He's ready for Lalo
I will be going to see this!   Marvel fans, check out the original Punisher movie with Thomas Jane, sorta quirky on some of the characters but still kicks ASS
Rarely get enthusiased by trailer but hot damn this looks good
"I'm going to f*ck you up!" - Positive intention without any doubts!!!
Song name
Does john wick have friends?  Nobody
Better call Saul
..." in theaters only" so NOBODY can see this movie feb.2021 😭
I can already tell the teenage son is gonna be the most annoying character in the movie
0:00 - 0:56, Family film about downtrodden family man 0:57+, Better Call Hardcore Wick.
Nobody:  Me: watching nobody
Damn... Hollywood is awesome... Can't expect such flicks in our country..
it's just like i watch jhon wick trailer... 😍😍😍
The Name should be Mr. Nobody
Saul's new identity is cool
I'm gay for Bob Odenkirk now.
Better Call Saul, BITCH!
Does this take place before Better Call Saul or after Breaking Bad?
Better Call Saul before he was a lawyer....A Nobody
Nobody is going to have Nobody in the theater
I love how this one man is associated with one specific character from a show that's kinda a decade old and everyone is going on a roll with it lol
That Fucking NOBoDY is JOHN WICK
Waa that a quick scope triple kill I seen ?!?!
As I wait for John 4 this will sustain me until then.
If John Wick had a Family.. this is the MOvie!
Why isn’t this just John Wick 4?
Batman without the bat ;)
Biggie's joint 'you're nobody (til somebody kills you)' is the perfect theme for this movie
in john wick tons of people fu##dup because of a puppy 2:27 here we go now on nobody, tons of people gonna fu##dup because of a kitty cat
Say the line Saul
One. Bad. Day. 🤡🔫🔪🔥💯
Wow, Kevin Costner looks so good in this role!
What happened to saving the twists for the movie?
12 years he work for dangerous people like Tuco salamanca,lalo salamanca & Heisenberg 😂😂😂
"Give me the goddamn kitty-cat bracelet" has to be one of the best line in this trailer for me
All that for a fricking kitty cat bracelet 😂
Художественный фильм : Better not call Saul, or how to return a bracelet with a cat.- Лучше не звоните Солу, или как вернуть браслет с котиком.
the little girl is the boss with the kitty cat bracelet.
The Equalizer The Baba Yaga (John Wick) And The Nobody, the Nightmare Trio has come alive!
Cant wait
That man looks like he knows a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy.
Some Give him the goddamn kitty cat bracelet
I hope Keanu does a cameo as wick !! 😎
I literally just watched the whole movie. Why make trailers so in depth?
What in bollyhood is going on the bus ...the fighting is ummmm idk...different in a bad way
Кто пришел на Серебрякова посмотреть - лайк!
Had to look this up cuz the ad only him getting punched
The Plot looks like it's revolving around the Kitty Cat Bracelet :) Just like it was a puppy in John Wick lol
Wait so is this comedy I’m genuinely asking
I'm never stealing a kitty cat bracelet again.
Turns out Jimmy didnt need mikes help after all
Nobody does it better
he could pull Bruce Willis and become full on action star
John wick vs nobody: pandemic
they rlly made a movie about me and nobody.....
Brother's nobody has stabbed me in my eye!!!!
Saul doing an action movie... interesting.
Plot twist: Saul's life after Breaking bad
did they just put a whole movie in 2 min trailer ? wtf
Don't call 9 1 1
Better call Nobody
Awesome action
What's the name of the song that's being played at the end
So if you're like me, an aging gen-x'er, this movie goes like this...  Martin Blank tried to keep his life together with his HS Sweetheart.  Didn't work out.  Knowing what he did, and that someone might come for him someday, they parted as friends.  But he never quit striving for that bit of normalcy, so he married again.  Became the middle-class American everyone expected him to be.  Entered his fifties.  Had a couple of wonderful children along the way.  But then it all caught up with him.  The mess he left in Grosse Point, all the previous checks he'd written, someone came to collect on those.  But thirty years later?  Who is Martin Blank?  Eh.  He's Nobody.
saul and mike back together :-D
That man deserves his own goddamn movie!
0:28 wexler-mcgill
Mr . Nobody=the boogey man.
Mike and Saul oh yeah
if Saul does not the lawyer, who is the lawyer then?
Intresesting
Good to see Saul is getting some work after relocating to a Cinnabon.
Nobody : Triple HeadShot!
This movie looks awesome, but Universal, I have to ask: why is this a theater only premiere? We're still in the middle of a pandemic, and most cinemas across the US are closed.
closer! release date 26th
"Give me the godd**m kitty cat bracelet! " lmfao
Combination of Taken and John Wick.
John wick: Electric Boogaloo
YES FUCK YES
oh yeah i gotta see this  Saul good
Just call saul baby..
Saul’s life after hiding
Better call SAUL WICK
It's good to call 911 But it's BETTER CALL SAUL
So.... he was called "The  Auditor " in the past . Looks like he would go along well with "The Accountant "
Very refreshing... love this guy!
Finally an action film starring a man. Yeah it's fiction but what fun to see revenge films! Let the bashing begin.
when you lose your job as a lawyer so you become a nobody
Really like Bob Odenkirk. Looking forward to this movie! :D
Better Call Keanu (all respect to everyone making this)
Ya might say, "He just wanted to grill..."
Im going to watch it twice.
I'm sorry I thought John Wick didn't have kids
This movie (series if in future) is gona be a score 10/10 , and don’t let those SJW insecure people tell you otherwise
*So this is what happened to Saul before helping Mr White*
Nobody: Nobody: Nobody
Wow. Looks good!

Can't wait. Love Bob Odenkirk and this movie looks great. Hope it lives up to the trailer.
This is why I use the Cinco Home Defense System.   If you can’t afford Cinco home security then Globocorp makes equally effective home security.
Can't wait! ...
should have cast Gregg Clark
Well Saul Goodman has changed his ways
So basically John Wick with a family but in a more middle class suburban house.
Damn so this is what happened to Saul after Heisenberg died....
The title should be "what if John wick's wife didn't died"
was his mug a reference to wexler and mcgill
smells like toxic masculinity and male power fantasy
If heisenberg was there now he'll be like  ; I'm the one who punch
John wick multiverse is happening! Yooo!
SALUTE 👍🏿💯❤️🎓
Nice....
They better have a family dog named Tugboat, or I'm not watching
Bootleggeg wick
Storyline reminds me of History of Violence.
no no no no no no why would Bob Odenkirk do this oh god no
I thought this was a sequel to breaking bad about his new life and stuff lmao
Seems like Death Wish to me.
Everybody gangsta till grandpa wick rolls up
I want to see this so bad. it looks awesome he could be John wicks cousin lol
...this is just another "John Wick"!...
Don’t Call Saul
You can call him anything you want  He’s Saul Goodman for me
Artillery Arthur!!!!!
Arriving to you in 2022: Asked
Holy phk, i gotta see this movie.
A garbage rip off of John wick and the equalizer crossed with every stupid Liam Neison move from the last decade. While trying to be a history of violence. All while looking like it was filmed as a Netflix original 😂
Soul Badman
By the writer of John Wick By the producer of John Wick To help you wait for the next John Wick.
Come soon
Wtf now that's what we could possibly call a fucking awesome underdog killer story
I really wish this is a part of John wick universe
'Kitty Cat Bracelet' would have been a far greater title for this.
Die hard fan of RR Ryan Reynolds as 6 Underground
Man i was watching a video on YouTube when this trailer played as a ad and o swear i watched it completely till the end and came back here. What a daymn great trailer. The guy who put it together should get a raise🥵 imma be watching this first day on release
Only here because I got a 10 second ad for this of just a guy getting punched in the face lol
What a mind blowing trailer 😍😳
God bless you 🙏🏼
Ive watched this so many times i want it to come out already
0:28 WM= Wexler McGill?
Saul good man..
“It’s ‘Saul Goodman’!”
Chuck's nightmare
John wick should be part of this universe
Just based off the fighting scenes I could tell this was the same producer as John Wick lol
wow, Saul to the rescue.
Went for Saul to Nobody
This is pretty like 'revenge'  our  short film I mean my short film
What a thing to watch during 💨 time, I don’t even care that it’s such a John Wick clone Bob Odenkirk sells this so hard 😂 if there isn’t a “s’all good man/Saul Goodman” reference I’ll be a lil choked tho
Man someone finally decided to direct “threat level midnight”
The US version of Harry Brown?
But he’s not a nobody though. Like wtf.
poor lalo
Literally crying with unabashed glee. 😁😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😁😂
better make red dead redemption movie....not this lame sheat...
Sweet bob o
All these unexpected senior actors are so perfect for such roles...Denzel, Liam Neeson, Keanu...now bob ! Gone are the days when we used to idolise just Arnold n Stallone...
Ah fuck; they made the laziest meme ever into a movie.
John Wick should have a crossover with this guy
This movie is fire 🔥
0:28 Wexler Mcgill
"Evacuate the city Engage all defenses  And get this man a kitty cat bracelet "
I WANNA SEE THIS! It looks like the best movie ever. YES, mess them up. Them, and so many others. And give back the kitty cat.
who
Is that Rorschach?
“Better Call Saul”
Old man really fucks better.
Who else is like fuck yeh , and fuck tired of JOHN WICK ??
From the producer of John Wick . Me : You son of bitch I am in....
Walmart john wick
Can't wait for this classic banger song remix.
That's Luis Prima's "I ain't got nobody" in the back ground. The live version with Keely Smith is something else!
Imagine have played a role so good no one will every remember you for anything else.
Thank you for having shown the whole movie, I don't have to see it now. lol
And what if this is from the John Wick's universe
This is what would have happened if John Wick's wife didn't die
what is back ground music please help🙏🙏
😂😂My my what a trailer 🔥
GIVE ME THE GODDAMMN KITTY CAT BRACELET
I hear my favorite song ^o^ that’s what led me here XD makes me so happy it’s in a movie.
OOO Jimmy McGill before Saul Goodmoan
Now I want him and John Wick to kick ass together
This video came up as an advertisement on the video I was watching and I had to watch the entire video for the name of the movie, very irritating waste of time, i was interested 30 seconds in and the next 150 seconds was waiting for the name.
this is what would happen if walter white kill every client he has
Am I the only one who thought it was going to be the punisher because of the black and white
PLEASE BE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE AS JOHN WICK! - if you go back and see the first trailer for the first John Wick movie - they mention the "Nobody"
Was waiting for to be out in February and now delayed to March. Something will be wrong...
this is why lalo left saul alone.
saul been acting up lately
What happened to goddamn saul goodman
Watching this makes me wanna fight with anyone with bloody face 😱😱
'GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACLET'  best line ever
Saul goodman in a different reality
All his friends are jerks. His family is terrible to him.
atty. Saul
The 2.8k dislikes are from his clients during Better Call Saul, and Walter White.
So this is what Saul Goodman did after he had to live a new life after Walter White.

Nice trailer. Feels like I watched the whole movie in 3 minutes
1st part of the trailer was so good then it  all  went to shit after they did john wick bs . it would have been so much better if a normal bloke who doesnt like to get into fight lost his mind and went into full fight club shit . but sadly the movie gonna be meh .
Im gonna fuck you up. Love it lol
Ayyapnum koshiyum bgm
If John Wick's wife had lived - the movie
bout time you make something showing the world that the liberals are NOBODYS 👍🏼
This looks so fucking good, only check it out bc SAUL
all 3 nearest theatres have gone belly up out of business due to covid.. the only option is a drive in which is neat.. but not ideal.. I guess movie previews are depressing now.
2:37 OoH BabY a TrIpLe
I knew you had it in you SAUL, Good Man!!
this is probably a john wick universe and john wick 4 will come after this movie and john lets him be and leaves him alone and he gave the title to john as baba yaga because he was on retirement and the fact that his fighting skills are similar to john’s maybe that john did fight him but let him be and he learned the moves of nobody.
Beter cäll soul
Is this John Wicks Dad?!
Saul Wick
Dream
What’s the freaking name of that song!
That movie is just what we all need. An action flick we can get lost in. At least someone is getting justice after being a bad ass about getting it. I’m sure he worked out some pinned up aggressions there. I can’t wait to dance to the music.
"Don't call 911, but Better Call Saul!"
So this is the person who took down Polyphemus
when I tell you when the ad for this popped up i thought it was super bowl insurance commercial and it caught so off guard when it keep going
When's this coming to VoD?  I'm not going to a theater anytime soon.
1:24   * cough * *cough *    *heisenberg*  * cough * * cough *
Heeey  that's soul good man
Movie developers: okay we blew i shit ton of our special effects money on the new John wick 3 but we still have a lot the effects leftover for another movie but Keanu is busy with Cyberpunk what should we do  Random employee muttering to themself: maybe we can just make another John wick character whose family isn't dead  Movie Developer: I GOT IT!! WE CAN MAKE ANOTHER JOHN WICK BUT THE FAMILY DOESN'T DIE!!! WE'RE GONNA BE FILTHY RICH BOYS
This looks fucking dope....hopefully they make the john wick universe the next marvel universe with a bunch if stand alone action heros with different style movies
Better call Saul
Yes
I saw this when it was called “A History of Violence”.
Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet lol hahahaha 😂😆🤣
“Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet”... Duly noted 😅
John Wick Excommunicado is lucky Nobody is already retired that day.
Well, no need to watch the movie after that trailer as I now know the entire plot from opening to closing credits. 👏  Good job, Hollywood.
Wow
There's some scenes in this with framing and atmospheres like those in Joker 2019
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET
All i can say is YES!!!!!
Bahahahaha he’s the badass person I. Hollywood
I'm in Texas, so I may actually get to see it in theaters. But, for now, a movie saying "only in theaters" is the new equivalent of "straight to DVD" which depresses the hell outta me.
So this is John wick if he had a family
Awesome
Bgm name pls
Give the damn kitty cat 🤣🤣 man This is HOLY FUCK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fake acting
Looks like Saul doing well for himself became a badass after the mess with Walter 🤣
I wanna know what that song is called
This seem like a good movie but this trailer is too long. I felt like I watched it already
First the dog now the kitty cat bracelet,people in the John wick world need boundaries
😍finally we gonna see Saul being badass
Give me back the kitty cat bracelet
Looks good.
Thought this was going to be those fake movie trailers that Taco Bell usually makes to promote their food  And then I saw the Universal Pictures logo
Woww
You put him and John Wick on the same team, you know its gonna be 1000-0
iosef: that fucking nobody?!?!?! vigo: that "fucking nobody" is... "  well we don't know his name yet lol
When you take a kitty cat bracelet, you should make sure who’s kid you’re stealing from.
Being around all these Salamancas will make you snap
The "nobody" guy is an auditor. This takes place in the John Wick universe. Are they setting up a John Wick cinematic universe?
The fact that this was written by Derek Kolstad and directed by Ilya Naishuller makes me long for this, John Wick, and Hardcore Henry to be in a cinematic universe with each other.
Cereal killers use cereal box guns
GIVE ME MY DAMN KITTY CAT BRACLET
It's all good man!
When you lose tugboat in the divorce.
Ain’t nobody ask for this.
Better Call Saul not 911 because Saul is back babie and this time he's transformed from Psycho Lawyer to Badass Psycho Hitman John Wick.
This movie is a History of Violence rip off. Almost the same concept lol. Hollywood need help
1:13 music name?
John Wick: His Dog Saul: Kitty Cat Bracelet
Fucking Bad Ass! Bravo!!!
I wish this is the same universe as jhon wick
Wait where did Clara go     BTTF fans will get it
Walter+Mike+Saul = Mr.Nobody
Plot Twist: this guy is John Wick's Brother in Law
“An impossible task”   Killing Nobody? What do u think ;)
Nothing can take place of John wick🖕🖕
Man the new season of better call saul looks awesome
Who else is glad that you got to see the devil side of Saul Goodman??
It would be amazing if this movie share the same universe with John Wick series.
February 26th??...its March
So... John Wick if his wife never died?
From the beginning, I was really hoping for more of a Joker-'down on his luck guy snaps' type deal, where maybe he goes over board on a Count of Monty Christo plan to get revenge.   Instead, I get a slightly funnier Jasohn Borwick clone. Where's the creativity?
Hey guys, here’s an idea:  Don’t call Saul 📵
0:41 Mike
Whats the name of the song?
I'm 90% sure this is a retelling of the Odyssey.
What are you still doing here old man ? No body “l AM GOING TO FUCK YOU UP “
Looks like Saul finally learn how to defend himself
Anyone ever seen the movie ‘Red’? Just checking...
Saul??
Gotta watch it now
anything for a kitty cat bracelet.
John Wick from a parallel Universe
Ok but I already saw the whole movie. This trailers.... Ugh
I think it will be a fun movie / action —but has this premise been put together in some sort -yeaa ( equalizer John Wick even that movie with  Ben affleck when he was an auditor lol with a similar set of skills lol )-I just like that it’s around the character who played -Better Call Saul ,,  that actor is great honestly just started watching Better Call Saul again, this is like perfect timing to me at least -  just a good Actor playing a role in a movie produced by the producers of  John Wick lol 😂 - similar yes - “but we’re gunna do it again “- and put  BOB odenkirk  as the star - And I think I saw the professor in there ( Christopher Lloyd) - still  interesting 🤔
❤️🔥JOHN WICKS LOST BROTHER❤️🔥
"Dont call Saul"
What song is that in the bus fight scene?
Agent:  Who the FUCK are you? NOBODY:  Me, I am the BOOOGEYMAN..... That's more appropriate.
be creative.. kitty cat ?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACLET
Man Saul lost weight
love it, what an awesome trailer.
These movies taught us 2 things as of now... Don't kill DOG'S and dont steal Kitty Kat Band Bracelet
For some reason when I first saw this ad I thought it was an ad for the last season of Better Call Saul. “What they’re doing a time jump?” Then 20 seconds in J was like “oh wait nevermind.”
So John Wick but funny.
omg first the dog now the kitty kat bracelet,bad guys are fu...ed
I feel like they are giving away too much.
This guy looks like a good lawyer!
Bob Okenkirk as an action hero?  Let's do this.  "In theaters only."  Yeah, good luck with that.
John buick
This trailer just came on as ad and I initially thought it was one of those lame high cost production commercials like that Taco Bell commercial with that actress and the actor from Stranger Things 😂
When Jimmy became John
Saul rules
Man over that last few year I'm becoming a huge fan of Bob Odenkirk
Me: Sweet live-action GTA 5
When John wick has his cousin over
"Who are you?" "SAUL"
Now this movie is interesting
If saul goodman was raised by John Wick
Do not be afraid of young soldiers , they die fast .  Be afraid of old soldiers , they know how to surviwe .  bad eglish sory  .
Heisenberg sent Saul a bit overboard with this one. Coming at ya with some real Goodman Justice.   💪😂👨‍⚖️
On theatres? Really?
" Don't call 911, better call Saul "
Man what a trailer  i don't know hero but he is perfect man
Heisenberg has really inspired Saul
Can I get one sub?
Omgeeeee
Deeper normalization and glorification of violence for sales. Where are the mainstream orgy movies glorifying sex by the way?
The fucking Nobody from John Wick is here

Don't know about the movie, but this trailer is a solid 10...  Edit : just watched the movie, it's very good... It got John wick's vibe (obviously) and also some dark comedy, like hbo's barry... I Loved it.. I'd give it 8/10
" Don't call 211 "  Me : putting the phone down ಠ ೧ ಠ
😢 this will be Legendary
This will be fire 🔥🔥🔥
who's love a crossover between nobody and john wick ??
Ye movie to 26 feb. Ko ane wali thi. Now i have to wait for 2 April
saul
Aaahh ..i gotta see this
Damn
I hv seen the whole movie
My name is not important. What is important is what I'm going to do. My genocide crusade begins here.
People always assume the big, butch, good looking, camo wearing guy is the badass. In reality you have a lot of normal, average guys who were into some serious shit/ Badass or secret military/LEO units who can kick ass. Just take a look at John Lovell from Warrior Poet Society. "The moment people think you are the most dangerous man in the room, is the moment you become a little less dangerous. It is not about simply being able to hit your target, it is about never become a target yourself" You would never guess that he is a badass by his looks, but he's an ex-SF guy with lots of combat experience.
Are we getting a John Wick Extended Cinematic Universe? lol
nobody : all this for kittytoy johnwick ; all this for dog spongebob :  all this for sandwish
FUCKIN RAD BRO!
In theaters only? Good luck with that.
I think he's upset because his shoes hurt...
so this guy live a same universe as john wick but different company huh
What did they do to tugboat...
are all the retired assassins coming back or what
I just cant imagine saul fighting man. He was just getting his ass beat by nacho lmao
can you watch this movie anywhere else besides the theater?
Saul Goodman comes back from retirement.
Give him his kitty cat bracelet, FFS
Many have commented before me but he's John wick+ the Equalizer also maybe a bit of the accountant
The difference between the two. John wick : I am dog guy Nobody: I am kitty guy lol and Kitty bracelet 🤣😂
It was supposed to be yesterday, but now they moved it back to March 26
Super !!
Two words - can't wait !!
Better Call Jaul Wickman
Beautiful
2:37 OHHH, OHHHHHH!!! OHHH MY GODDD, MOM GET THE CAMERAAA!!!!
Bob Odenkirk "Better Call Saul", says  don't Call..lol. This movie will satisfy my hunger until Better Call Saul returns in June 2021
Home alone on steriods and drugs
Ok but what if this is the start of a John Wick cinematic universe in which we could possibly see both of these characters either killing each other or cooperating or first one then the other.
wow now saul is doing cosplay of jonh wick
there really good at fucking ruining the exitment of movies..  they literally tell you everthing spoil whole fucking movie . rather just seen him snapping one time and then boom done why the fuck they gotta tell us the whole story line.. desperate fucks
Same universe as John Wick?
Better Call Nobody
0:40 Mike Ehrmantraut
Is this a remake of "A History of Violence"??? Same fucking story with other directors? I don`t get it.
did he just act like John wick.
Him and the coffee mug love it :)
I guess Walt and Saul are officially "done".
replace that I'm gonna fucj you up line with Better call saul
Better than John wick
0:57 is that Kickboxer:Vengeance actor??
Waiting for John wick and nobody cross over
I think this movie has been released today....
Hell yeah
oooh maaan  SSOOOOOO COOOOOOL!!!
john wick:u killed my puppy i will end ur entire carier  this dude:GIVE ME THE KITICAT BRACELET!
It's not nobody    It's     Slippin 'jimmy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Jon wik mated with taken?
if only it was keanu reeves
The Bus scene looks like The Joker (2019) but if Arthur was the Punisher
Does anybody know what that song is , I can’t understand a word but I luv it ??
This comes out Tomorrow!
Miguel Macguill
0:54  Alexander Pal))
How does Hollywood keep coming up with all these original ideas?
this guy is breathtaking AND 10 years older
Bro of John Wick 🙊
Who the fuck cut this trailer
what a dumb song in the trailer...habadhabhahdhabahbah
Who noticed kickboxer's lead actor alaain moussi on Bus fight👍
I loved this guy, whoever he is!
1:01 I thought it was Jensen Ackles at first.
Bi banamı jhon wick'in çakması gibi geldi
More EXTREME VIOLENT MOVIES SCRIPT WRITERS. No wonder the YOUTH in AMERICA have no Chance at SANITY
sequel will be john wick and nobdoy teaming up to stop the pyramid
Nobody: For 12 Years I worked  for some dangerous People? R.Kuklinsky: You Talking To Me
It's f**king awsome!! Woooo
I'm in.
Saul Breaks Bad...
John Wick: Nobody killed my Dog Hutch Mansell: You talking to me?
just another john wick
same last 20 years movies 😒
Repeat value for this trailer is crazy high!
Is this movie in John Wick Universe ?
Just imagine if Walt is the main character in this movie..
Hahaha... After he's done better call Saul !!
2:43 Lydia Rodart Quale? 😂
Better call Saul the movie
This movie plot seems reasonable considering entire Lord of rings series was about throwing a little ring in mountain hole.
Another cheap john wick copy
Oh yea I can't wait to watch tommrow
imaging jordan peterson
It's not what you did son . It's whom you did . Who ? That fucking NOBODY.... That fucking NOBODY is John Wick.....
He isn’t that kind of guy.
Am also nobody
Someone better call Saul... Oh wait they did
Is this a true story?
Advanced John Wick!
If this movie and John Wick do take place in the same universe they need to team up and fuck the high table up
This looks so wank, but I'll watch anything with Bob Odenkirk...
0:29 “WM” Even though it says “Williams Mfg. Ltd,” it almost seems like a reference to Wexler McGill. 😉
This is basically like taken starring saul goodman
I thought nerd with repressed anger issues was walt's thing
this is what happens if John Wicks wife didn't die
So it is just the primary stage John Wick script.. where he was  aged and had a family..
John wick 👍        Vs  Nobody 💗
This is obviously in the John Wick universe
I wish they had kept the character an ordinary guy who transforms his pent up anger into an extraordinary guy. Making him an expert trained killer makes him unrelatable
Moral of the story: Don't fuck with a lawyer
It's just like seeing all Saul Goodman's frustrations build up and just ... explode. Gonna watch this, go Saul f... them up! 🤙🏼
Looks like Saul Goodman is now Saul Badman
Looks like a video game
Goodman turned bad
Winston: Nobody-than.
Lol this is basically the joker
Laugh if wick makes a cameo in this 😂😂
They changed  the release  date
Does anyone else hear a British-sounding accent with his wife and son?
Русский коммент. Потому что Найшуллер  и Паль. Я в нетерпении)))
Bob Odenkirk legendary actor
So he's the boogyman that John wick was sent to kill
What nobody realises is this is back to the future 4 and he's a grown up marty and Doc is secretly a retired hitman
This is really some good shit❤️
Dnt call 911..i m nobody👌🏻👏🏼

Wow l, John Wick has aged a lot.
Ugh...😒
I wanna see this movie.
This looks like the after movie of breaking bad
💯🥂
2:03 Could you imagine if some of those gold coins from the John Wick movies were in that container.
Is that Wonderwomans mother???
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG17ypWnqzo&t=2008s
That f***ing nobody...is Nobody.
U better call Saul 📞🤠
Nobody : Absolutely Nobody : Nobody: I'm Nobody.
Saul there you are buddy
I cant wait
That f*cking nobody... is Saul Goodman... the sunroofs he defecated through that day, lay the foundation to what we are now...
Nobody does it better 😁(John Wick)
1:12 does anybody know the name of the music
Saul was Called. Saul handled it.
what if this is a timeline in john wick
This looks great!
Bob deserves an Oscar just for this trailer
C mon, this guy is like walmart assasin.
Saul Wick 😳
Тоже удивлён увидеть здесь Сашу Паля. Не Горько конечно, но уже Голливуд
Still better than Pattison's batman.
Better call Saul
Better call  saul nobody😅
I thought this a rip off of John Wick
1:12 അയ്യപ്പനും കോശിയും ഈ സംഗീതകാരന്‍ കണ്ടിട്ടുണ്ട്, ഉറപ്പാ !!!
it's a good thing when bob odenkirk doesn't get the role for michael scott in the office. it leads him to better role and now this!
This is the moment when Walter White became Heisenberg !!!
what a boomb trailer woah it's like ......,. i don't have words to say 🙃😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂🙆🙆
iam goona mad on this trailer 🙃🧐🤣😂🙆🙆🙆😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Universal teams and partners, well done!
Now I remember one line from John Wick: "That's FUCKING NOBODY is John Wick" - "Oh"
great trailer ... btw.. perfect sound track
Yeah. Can`t wait to see Bob Odenkirk is smashing faces. He can to a new WICK maybe... A nother Wick, a Wick with a litt bit outta control
Wait I swear I’ve seen this trailer before but with another lead actor
Would've been wholesome movie if they added the credits in here too
I saw the thumbnail and thought it was a spoof on john wick where it was just a guy who thought he could be tough shit but never actually wins a fight, while I think that would be a really funny movie this is fine to
Him getting back his daugther's kitty cat bracelet is like John Wick getting back his car
script: nobody: "who are you"  nobody john wick: that f***'in nobody is john wick

that producer of john wick is a crazy producer. he must be eaten bullet for his launch 🤣
how to watch a whole movie in 3 minutes nice trailer
Saul got serious PTSD!!!
God, losing tugboat really made him mad.
Bob Odenkirk went from Family Man to badass action hero. I will go see that movie.
0:40, Mike, is that you?
AW... halfway through I thot, "Kinda cool. Man gets pushed too far, goes into training, gets ready for action." Then it turns out he was always this way. Lost the vibe of it as it felt like WIck Redux. Maybe the story goes deeper. Hope so.
Yeah Baby. John Wick's Married brother
Holly molly, i am going to watch 1st show😍
Finally! A movie about me!
new univere of john wick and nobody
Old John...
That´s Saul´s new identity.
1:33 is a john wick moment
I can't take Bob Odenkirk seriously as an action-packed movie star in this one. lol
Wooow... if john wick's wife was still alive.
It’s about damn time we get to see Saul Goodman hit back ha
Is it releasing in india????
Tell me this isn't EXACTLY like the first John Wick movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
BGM Rockssss
ordinary Russian film! ♣♥♦♠
Saul has been promoted
What is the song at 1:13
NOBODY Hardly inspired from MASTER and its character BHAVANI JAI BHAVANI
John wick: aah a worthy opponent
So this is what Saul meant when he said he was gonna take care of it himself...
I'm definitely gonna watch this one
"Give me the God damn kitty cat bracelet" that's all I heard before I died laughing
Intro will start with Nobody .. Nobody..... Nobody does it better
No one:  No one: Nobody
Saul Badman
It's Mel Gibson's Payback 2.0 and John Wick 1    a retread of a retread   but whatever I'll take it over being stuck at home for another year.
John wick off of wish😂
"Beware of an old man in a profession where men usually die young"
Mr soul🤐 What have you done 🤐🤐
Wait, what?  This is new 🙄
John wick for family men
ALRIGHTY I AM IN
I'm stoked that Mike is in this from better call Saul !
Nice John wick remake😂
FUCKING EPIC!
I wanna nobody nobody , but you.
He’s punching the wall where Marco died. You know slippin jimmy is BACK!
Looks good
So mr.nobody huh.
I just realized that the villain is Gordon Ramsay
He looks like John Wick post retirement.
Gotta love Bob Odenkirk. I have never seen John Wick (I know, I know...) but seeing Bob in this role makes me anxious to see it.
My favourite trailer if 2021🔥🔥
John wick: hei i killed a bunch of people just because they killed my dog,wbu Absolutely nobody Nobody: i also killed a bunch of people but they just took my daughters kitty cat bracelet
Nobody 💋 Nobody 👄 Nobody 💋 does is better.
Looks dope
Feb 26 I am ready!!  *After reading description* Ok I can wait
Is it going to be extended universe of john wick??
Oh hell yeah!!!!!!! Looks so dope!!!

Is this John Wick or Better Call Saul?
Its all good man...
James Mcgill,Saul Goodman,Slippin Jimmy,Gene Takavic and now Nobody.
The meaning of better call Saul
Saul got BABA yaga soul.
This is going to be fucking awesome
It's like a history of violence + John wick
Ilya Naishuller really improved the fluidity his of fight scenes since Hardcore Henry. Idk if that's cause it's not in first person or not, but the action here looks superb regardless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Gimme Jimmy!!
John wick as a dad
Worth  https://youtu.be/wDrsgDwbkxk
Yes now this is a movie I would love to see.
يااعرب هاذا الفلم موجود في نت فلكس؟
Joker vibes but batman mixed.
Can anyone combine these two fictional characters in john wick 4
John Wick: Killed your dog too huh? Nobody: Stole my daughter's kitty kat bracelet. John Wick:.............w-wtf dude!? Nobody: What? John Wick: You murdered all those guys for that, the hell is wrong with you? Nobody: What do you mean the hell is wrong with me you killed like a hundred guys for your dog! John Wick: Yeah of course I did, it was my DOG dude! My dead wife gave me that dog. Just get you kid another bracelet you goddamed psychopath smh *leaves* Nobody:...............
Good to see Jimmy finally stand up for himself physically
They should make a sequel  NOBODY - THE AUDITOR
Let’s hope for a John Wick crossover
Sal Goodman, has had enough
I can't imagine him be like john wick like I only know him as Saul Goodman
So...if John Wick was a comedy?
I keep Coming here again & again & again!
I see he learned alot from Mike and Varga
This could be a John Wick, but with depth and humor
I wish the old man was Mike Ehrmantraut 0:40
And that's how ladies and gentlemen, Saul Goodman becomes Saul Badman
NOBODY DOES IT BETTER
Better call nobody!
9
The starting scene tell us so much about society they are blaming him because he didn't beat robbers
Well you need legal help now so you better call saul
-Have you heard of John Wick, he once killed 3.... -In a bar! with a pencil, I have heard the stories. -But have you heard of his brother?
Why does this look like a really good cgi
What's that background music?
Conor mcgregor brought me here
Nah
Gene Takovic really lost it...
Don't call 911, better call Saul.
somobody can tell me the name of the song that apear in the bus fight plsss( is not "just a gigolo")
"Me ? Im Nobody"    Another Guy  : "THATS NOBODY IS A FUCKING JHON WICK !!!"
Trailer isallgoodman
Bob odenkirk has different level of acting skills
Like John wick
Саня Паль , ору
Saul finally had enough
The accountant, the auditor and john wick i would like to see a teamup
No matter what movie he appears in.. I will always call him better call saul
Marshall boss
The cover reminds me of the GTA cheat "Nobody likes me".
This is John Wick if his wife survived
the John Wick I didn't know I needed.
This is HUM
"And still john wick is better than nobody  "
Bruce Willis reload
1:12 i am obsessed with it.... it deserves a great award for sound design and edit...
Anyone noticed WM cup? Wexler McGill. :D
1:32 Jeffery Epstein
Better call Saul or call nobody
Goodman
who tf is this guy.
*There should be a Keanu Reeves Cameo in this movie..*
Don't call 911 better call wick Mr wick
John wick side kick
If the background music was a lil bit more, it would have been sensational.
He is John Wick's cousin who has amnesia
For those of you who don't know the boogeyman,. Thats him ,  They paid John wick to kill him , and after killing him ,John took his name as the boogeyman
He better call Saul
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
What if he was John Wicks teacher
I’m just kinda mad Ilya didn’t also put this one in first person
John wick 4 is out!!!!!
Near the end ( 2:41 ) is the same move john wick made in the first chapter
Please please 😬🙏be in john wick universe
Looks really good, please put on Netflix :)
1 punch old man
That song
John Wick Robert McCall Hybrid, Dangerous Family man Funny version!!! Cool
Saul went full on John Wick mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
I didn't know that John Wick had a cousin! 😎
Saul goodman
Fun fact they made shoot em up movies like this long before john wick idiots
my eyes: seeing this trailer  my brain: thinking of john wick
Man he deserves more movies!! So underrated actor
Thank you for the whole dam movie
Why do I get the impression that this is essentially a parody of john wick?
Hollywood is seriously lacking ideas. Make a proper movie 🙄
Better call Saul!😅
John Wick
Producer from John Wick. Now, that's a little lame. Don't you think?
Nobody:  Bob Odenkirk : I’m Nobody.
you want to be known as a nobody because nobody would expect you to be able to do this
Lets just say Nobody knows somebody who knows somebody
What was the song that played in background
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_logo
Goddamn this looks retarded. America's iq is creeping into single digits. I'm al for entertainment but c'mon. You guys are making Idiocracy (2006) into a documentary.
family man john wick
Jon Wick's OLDER brother???
Plot twist: John wick and Saul were brother in arms
Dont call 911  This is the part.. Youuu while watching suppose to say.. "better call saul.. '' 😂😂😂😂
Say no more....
My man went a long way from being beaten up by an old man  To being compared to jon wick
Better call Saul
John wich should have called Saul
Come on Ilya
Looks Like Fun Movie !!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you a retired hitman that just had to murder your former employer's henchmen in order to retrieve your daughter's kitty cat bracelet? BETTER CALL SAUL!
Everybody’s a nobody in their minds
Don’t call 911, better call Saul
1:19 I was serioysly expecting to see Kim here
And I thought Walter White was the real deal!
Looks bit much, like there really isnt any story to this just a killer killing people
A John wick I can relate to. 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_logo
Did anyone else have a weird moment where they thought that old dude was Mike Ehrmantraut
This is exactly the type of movies I would never watch.
Meanwhile producer. Hey john..u kill everyone for a dog. And u mr nobody..kill everyone for kittycat bracelet.
what's the name of the song used in this video? that goes like haleba lula haluba lula 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sounds cool though
John Wick: Suburban dad edition
They say " nobody is perfect " !  I say, " Yeah true, i am that perfect nobody " !
Plot Twist: This is John Wick brother and they don't see each other for a long, long time. And now, he will return to help John Wick to destroy the high table.
Looks like saul broke bad
so, this is John Wick but his family won't be killed and he is much older.
Who the fuck are you? Saul Goodman.
:Who the fuck are you? :Saul Goodman
I think this works
just awesome
But still the fucking Nobody is John Wick
So it’s basically American Beauty + John Wick.  Sign me in.
PLOT TWIST: HIS IS SON IS JOHN WICK  SUBSCRIBE MY CHANNEL IF YOU AGREE?
John’s brother
Good action movie.
Viggo Tarasov: That "f***in' Nobody" is John Wick.
Isn't he, our innocent saul
Слава Україні
I can’t wait to go back to the movies :( I want to see matrix 4 and avatar2 so bad :((((  at least theaters are finally opening back up ... all these straight to stream movies are pretty much garbage; so sad that the industry will die without theaters and these production companies don’t even fight for the films or even think about the future of the industry (it isn’t streaming, when films get set to stream people just download them and the movie makes so little cash)... so sad.
he is the quite kid in school who was used to be bullied cause he wasn't cool      yet .
one of the guys in the bus looked like Jensen Ackles - Dean from Supernatural or was it actually him?
Plot twist: he is actually john wicks father...and u can see little john wick in the trailer
"Dont call 911" - randomly pops off john wicks name in my mind
He's the suburban John Wick
The unwieldy octagon initially move because golf alternately carve pro a hapless gladiolus. vengeful, hapless drama
"Give me the goddam kitty cat bracelet"-- brain wen numb🤣🤣🤣
Mind blowing 🔥
I thought it was feb
This is essentially John Wick, but with a living family. Will still watch it
Nobody..Nobody..Nobody does it better.
Next time put Keanu Reeves in the shoes of a lawyer and call it "Better call John"
Song?
"Don't call 911."  *Changes clothes*  "Better call Saul!"
But what about the ridiculous traps from a can of nails and a shooting mousetrap https://youtu.be/MwUHwQatUFU?t=7 Well, straight alone at home, it is understandable, the director grew up on them)) In general, everything looks funny especially the frame with a plastic pistol https: //youtu.be/MwUHwQatUFU?t=33 And so it will do)) Well, the dialogues are just a miracle))
ahh! he's the guy that knows a guy that knows another guy.
Better KILL Saul
Saul evolved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Better "Not" call saul the movie
Eagerly waiting for the movie
this is john wicj when his wife is still alive and had kids
Who the f%&* are you ?
Jimmy was never the same after his brother's death.
john wick's cousin
Better call John Wick !
i am james bond 007...
John Wick if his wife and dog didn’t die
He deserved this role 👍🏽
Just fun fact: The man who directed this movie, is streaming COD on his twitch channel ( RealNaishuller - if you wonder )
Saul Goodman 🔥
Aaron Paul joins westworld sent to the future!!!       Bryan Cranston: plays a dad who is a Judge and goes to protect his son and himself from the mafia so Bryan breaks bad in your honor!!!        Bob Odenkirk: I’m gonna Fuck you up! Turns into Jackie Chan and Keanu Reeves in nobody
After watching this trailer i questioned myself   : Could anybody replace John wick ? And fast answer comes throught my mind  Nah Nobody.....   And then i realized i answer it.
Don't believe him, he is Saul Goodman in disguise. I think he is planning something.
He seriously took a line from Mr white... "we're done when I say we're done"
Then hu r ju ...em noe body 👍
Been waiting for a new iliya naishulev movie for too long!
So , john wick with character development.
John Wick has a family now!!
Kitty cat bracelet 😂☠️
Why am I getting John wick vibes? And why does his way of speaking kinda give off John wick vibes as well?!
I'm already thinking Crossovers y'all.
Tenia esperanzas de verla el 26 de febrero, ahora la mandan para el 2 de abril. Juegan con mis sentimientos ;C
JAJAJA LA RAJA, grande Saul (L)
*Better to stay away from soul*
This is every man's dream.
Excellent cinematography...
John Nobody: Parabellum
I can't tell if this is supposed to be a comedy or serious
Goosebumps 🥺❤️
he kinda look like bruce willis
2:40 cool.
Say my name
aaand i just watched a movie.
1:10
if jhon wick had a family...
This movie is going to break the records
John wick killing everyone just because his car and his dog... Ladies and gentleman, meet john wick's big brother who killing anyone for his cat... Never mess with the family, i'm serious...
So nice to see Kevin Costner in new films
can you plz tell me at 1.13 min which soundtrack or music you used in the trailer? soundtrack name plz? I love this one.
White community is gonna loove this
In fact, this is Jimmy's new identity after Gene Takovic has been recognized
Gooffy version of John wick
Seeing this kind of actor in a meaningless movie, frustrated me.
Just WOW!!
"NOBODY VS JOHN WICK" Coming soon! #JS
Here comes Mr. NoBody - John Wick's uncle.
I thought this is Mr. Nobody from Fast and Furious franchise
Ok so Last Month I saw this trailer when this is released then My reaction is MEH 😑, Like I dont even know who is this guy, I didn't finished the trailer and then After that I Binge watch All Breaking Bad Episodes for the First time and then I finished yesterday and then I saw this trailer again and my reaction is WTF!!! Its *Freakin* *SAUL* 😳 My bad I judged too quickly
THIS IS JOHN WICK UNIVERSE
When will the killing end...?
I’m actually excited about this movie and I fucking love the music it’s phenomenal lol
May be John wick went on paternity leave
What the hell. Man this killing me bro🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜. Dam super 😘😘
Can’t wait to see Saul Badman in action 💪🏻
Hahaha yeni jhon wick bu mu
This movie: I'm nobody  Next movie: I'm Palpatine
Missed opportunity to use Wonder Girls' Nobody.
Better call Nobody 💗
Better call Saul right  ?
Let’s all go watch a movie about how cool guns are and give money to an industry that hates every American that believes the 2nd amendment isn’t for muskets.
0 - 60 seconds of this trailer: Family Drama about Bob Odenkirk finding confidence  60 seconds+ :  I stand corrected
Bad guys: What are you still doing here old man? Hutch Hansell:  I am gonna fuck you up!
Me: oh my god I love Bob Odenkirk so much I don't think I could possibly love him more! Hutch: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!! Me: It appears I was wrong 😍
Hey guys, Can you tell the soundtrack halebalema plss?
sir we want harry potter next series please sir
Saul finally broke bad
This looks so good....
I really thought that was Jonathan banks for a second lol.

Was Liam Neeson not available?
"Don't Call 911" "Then whom should we call?" "You better call John Wick!!"
Damn bro why was Saul scared of mike breaking his legs?
Plot twist is that there's no plot twist
2:48 Valar Molghulis
I'm not gonna lie, this looks pretty decent. 🙏
Don’t mess with John Wicks dogs   Don’t mess with Robert McCall friends   Don’t mess with the MacManus brothers  And you certainly don’t fuck with Hutch Mansell Family
I hope that in future sequels it crosses over with John Wick.   John Wick 5: Nobody
April 2, 2021
How about a crossover between this "Nobody" and "John Wick"?  Because that NOBODY is JOHN WICK 👀
Don't call 911 but Better Call Saul🔥😂
The movie nobody ask
It should b named mr nobody
this happens when you don't call saul
Better call Saul wick
Saul Goodman finally kicking ass
-who the fuck are you ? - me ? I'm Saul Goodman
I gotta say this movie might be #1 in 2021... any otherwizers....
Jimmy McKill
There will be NO theatres open on Feb. 26th.
its like they tapped in to the urge for everyone to go postal lol
John Wick: All this for a dog. Nobody: All this for a kitty cat bracelet. Henry: All this for a turtle. Furry Body: All this for a bunny costume. *And it goes on...
Ok this really looks good! Why haven't l seen it. . .
Auditor?   I'm hearing The Accountant, hahaha
Saul alternate timeline where instead of being saved by Chuck from prison he joins an elite group
All this over a stolen kitty kat bracelet I had a whole iPhone stolen and my parent were just told me that’s the neighborhood and bought me a new one 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
HE SAID IT, HE SAID IT
Me:can we get John wick  Mom:we got John wick at home
"I'm a nobody. And you can't kill someone with no body"
Better Call Nobody
Nobody = Jhon Wick 10: Retirement  When said "Don't call 911" he almost looked like a pissed off Keanu
Hardcore Henry 2: 3rd Person
I'm going to watch this movie for sure. 😎👍
That moment when they've showed 80% of the movie
This will be great if let Nobody man go into John Wick universe by let him and john like old friend.
It's a shame if it's just the cut
Better Not Call Saul
John Wick: Universe building.
the background song just makes me lol
stupid
is this Rorschach from the Watchman?
So... White Iron Fist? Got it. Lmao.
Whoa, hold up a sec... Ain't that Jimmy? The same cop from John Wick? lmao
There are no theaters on February 26th
Nobody knows that you are watching the  trailer of nobody  And I know only one person can understand my joke and that is nobody
0:28 Wexler-McGill mug???
this is like if John wick and The Equalizer had a baby but that baby was raised by Ryan Reynolds
So, we went from Cat to Dog and back to Cat...
what the hell are u doing SAUL  !!
0:28 Wexler and McGill
This is family guy xd .. Only indians knows
That's a Domestic John wick right there folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_logo
i bet iko uwais and team behind this film . no american put the gun down and fight ! ;)
What is that amazing theme song?
Better call saul flashed the intersect 3.0 haha 🔥🔥🔥
What that black and brown compact pistol brand ?
John Wick: "You shouldn't have killed my dog"  Hutch Hansell: "You shouldn't have stolen my daughter's kitty Kat band bracelet!"
This looks cool af
This GOT to be part of the John Wick universe, it looks so good and it's so similar in theme too
A FORMER WRITER FOR SNL IS NOW AN ACTION STAR!
So we've officially made Nicolas cage a genre now?
I guess bieng no body better than just a cinnabon supervisor.
_Don't call 911.... Better Call Saul._
Russian stars. It will be a masterpiece!
VERY common plot, not interested
god damn the dialogue is so corny but still so good
Plot twist: He's Mr Nobody from fast and furious 7
John wick with a cat ?
Better calll Saul🙏
Vary satisfying trailer
So??? Which is it ? Feb26th or April 2nd ?
Can't f..king wait
1:14 song?
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET
Don't know the movie but trailer is 10/10.
I will tell you what to do in an emergency  Dont call 911!  CALL NOBODY 💯
I'll say it again... we all know this role was created for Jordan Peterson ... they should have casted him for it.   I would have went to my grave laughing.
Saul Wick.
for all the bad comments, but i feel everyone wait for this release as this is very entertaining from the director who know how to make film that entertained!!
"Gimme the goddamn kitty cat bracelet"
John Wack
so its... Bob Wick?
Someone get this man a lawyer
What the fuck, Every other person is either a special forces or ex mafia. This is not how normal people operate bruh. We got a problem we go to police and NOT starts shooting people...
Remember neds explosion of anger in that one episode where they destroy his house? This is him now...
I was looking forward to the film but... Fk me... that was a horrible trailer giving all the plots of the film away... no point in watching it now :-(
Song at 1:12 ?
Song?
Iscrotin disinrrolado da gota!!! De Sall Goodman a novo John wick 😂😂😂👏👏👏
he needs a lawyer, this is not goodman...
Wowwww🔥🔥🔥
so like it's in the same universe as john wick?
I expected it to be called "Hardcore Henry: 3rd person view"
Maybe it’s secretly setting him up as the main assassin in John wick 4
This new Kevin Costner movie's gonna be awesome!
It would be nice if john wick makes a cameo or have some kind of connection to him
Ultimate 🤘
them: who are you? me: i'm nobody special
I watched this trailer like 87 times already. Can’t get enough!
Better call john wick old
is no one gonna talk about how the guy who directed this also directed hardcore henry? Time to get some amazing action scenes!
baka saul yan
when you order john wick from wish
How can i get the exact remix version of this song???
Remake of a history of violence?
Thats what you call an action ....amazing
Again with the tired ass story of falling down white man with special abilities returns. Yawn
nobody is in nobody
“That F**king N O B O D Y is John Wick.”   Could this take place in the John Wick Universe!?
Thea...Ters Only? *Confused Oonga Boonga*
Plot twist : he is the boogyman
is nobody... nobody..
the medium gameplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVyxhIa00I
2:37 is that idris Elba
yes liberals are (nobody) important
"Who the fu*k are you?" "Me? I'm Saul Badman."
Wow in theatres only. Cool 😎👍
This is f**king fantastic. Music is also 🔥🔥🔥
My money on this movie
So, that's what Saul Goodman became after retirement... 😀
கேள்வி: யார்ரா நீ? பதில்: வால்டர் வைட் வக்கில்டா... ஜான்விக்கு அப்பன்டா...
So this Nobody is John Wick's Uncle. Watch the end  of the credit scene & I bet he'll go to John Wick for help or....  have Thanksgiving Dinner LOL
I'm an expert of my craft, and I can safely say this looks like a movie
Wasn't this song in Just Dance? "Just A Gigolo"
The most painful deceive Video: In theaters febuary 26 Video description: In theaters only April 2. ;c
Man, is THIS cool
I didn't know John Wick had a brother. 🤣  on the serious side it looks like it going to be good.
More of this please
Damn, kim aged poorly.
Well this looks awesome.
John Wick + Saul Goodman = John Goodman😂😂
Are you sure this is not the sequel of Saul/Gene??!!!
kickass 3
boii he better call saul
clemente-ite
Well... I think this movie is Pretty cool... pretty, pretty cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Not too shabby
This new Mitski music video is a bit strange...
Ciekawe, kurwa...
Coming soon. Who? No body.
We all aspire to be Nobody.....
So this is what John Wick would have looked like if his wife hadn't died.  Does this mean there's a John Wick multiverse?
WOOOW
whats the theme song?
Fuck. YES! WHY HAVE I ONLY JUST HEARD ABOUT THIS?
looks like Saul really changed since his Breaking Bad days
Yea he was a nobody till he started  defending meth dealers...better call saul
After his highest paying client gets locked up jessie leaves he becomes no body !
Is nobody going to talk about how it says in theaters February 26 but then everywhere else says April 2nd?
The director is Ilya Naishuller, everything he makes is a masterpiece. Hardcore the movie and music videos like Leningrad - Voyage and Bitting Elboys - Control. The best...
So Bob Odenkirk went from mild mannered Saul to full on Death Wish, Taken (particular set of skills), Rambo, and of course John Wick (so does this have a kitten like John Wick had a puppy and it dies like the puppy did?  (Emphasizing with a loud voice but not yelling)THATS WHAT'S KEPT ME FROM WATCHING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.   I'M PROUD TO BE PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSOM WHO HAS NOT SEEN ANY JOHN WICK MOVIES.  Does not mean I don't like R rated action movies.  The Original Die Hard is the best action made.  Thought the last Rambo: Last Blood was ok.
Gimme the goddamit kitty cat bracelet
What's the song?
Lady: Who the fuck are you Saul: me I m woooo better call Saul.
Me:(in sleep)   Slippin Jimmy....Nah   Gimme Jimmy....yay   (Next day) My mom;Who's Jimmy?? Me; Nobody.
Soundtrack. ?
He was like Tommy Shelby, but retired.
He is John Wick's Dad.
Exatley picked onion love pickled eggs mmmh pickled eggs
John Wick: Hi Dad...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
This is the time when Saul become Jimmy.
Alma’s Dad is out here after all
2:07 Серебряков?
wahow
Finnaly some realistic superhero,FU*K THEM UP ALL....WITH BIG LOVE FROM SERBIA.💪🏻😎🇷🇸🔥
-"Where's the kitty cat bracelet?" - It's all good, man!
Its funny how saul went full jhon wick on this one 🤣
The beat after “ I wish they picked my place” is one of the cleanest beats
Killing Nobody was the Impossible Job John Wick got as a Ticket out. But they came to a truce and He started Living with his Family now.  - Some random guy online
Nobody does it better !
Did anyone else see that Wexler- Mcguill coffee cup?
So this is what Jimmy's been up to since Breaking Bad.
I was watching the mcgregor poiririe fight and I thought it just meant nobody was showing in the theaters because of COVID 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Even older John Wick
wait is this a breaking bad movie
From the creators of John Wick comes this John Wick knockoff. Don't miss it.
I saw this maybe for the 10th time, and i think, i dont even need to watch whole movie, this trailer is satisfiing enough!!:)
I noticed the nod to Better Call Saul with the "WM" on the cup. Nice touch.
JWCU is official John Wick Cinematic Universe
So who knew we had an extended Wick Universe
nobody: literally nobody: Nobody: Where's the kitty cat bracelet
imagine if hutch mansell, john wick, robert mcall and quan ngoch on the same team...
this is the moment when Saul become John Wick
I saw this trailer when it first came out as an ad and I thought it looked good and then I just started watching Better Call Saul like two days ago I’m on season three and I fucking love it I was looking for more stuff that this guys in and this looks great too definitely gonna try to see this in theaters
Nobody should team up with Mr Wick
Did you make them fear the NIGHT?
Everyone's gangsta till Walter White kidnapps you
So...john wick?
Why did he not flick the cigarette, whilst saying? Me? I'm nobody.
it´s like a harcore version of that Malcolm chapter where Hal couldn´t take out a thief and Reese hit it with a bat.. then Hal goes around the city looking for trouble...
I feel like I've just seen the entire movie, trailers like this that reveal 90% of the movie suck.
John Wick Chapter 4 : Nobody
I think he is John wick's father
People: pls call 911  Mr nobody: don't call 911.
Who am i nobody
I can't stop watching this trailer! I wish I could press the like button more than once :)
When ur daughter's lost their kitty bracelet, call Nobody
John Wick's Mid-Life Crisis?
This looks kinda dumb, another John Wick style action movie. I was hoping there would be more depth.
"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY-CAT BRACELET!!!"
is this in the same universe as john wick?
You killed my dog.  Give me the bunny..  Give me the GD Kitty Cat Bracelet....
damn this movie so cool but wheres the theater right now  i  have to watch this
The release date in the trailer: February 26 The release date in the description: April 2  I’m sorry, what???
Horrible John wick knock off
The Auditor and Baba Yaga.  If this is indeed in the same universe, imagine the awesomeness between Reeves and Odenkirk. Amazing.
2:43 Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The constitution says you do! And so do I.
0/10 there were people in it
Instant cinema gold!
Is this if John Wick was able to start a family?
01:12 anyone plz tell me which song kr music is it??
It seems Saul didn't ended well as a lawyer  Shall I better call Saul?... Or better call Nobody?
🤨
I'm gonna watch it coz somebody already told me that.... . . . . . . . . . . "NOBODY DOES IT BETTER"😂😂😂
What is the Over/Under that this opens in "theaters" on April 2?
so this is what happened after hajis quick vanish
John Wicks odd uncle. Looks great.
In theatres only? Good move Universal.
Soundtrack???
I'm in love 😁
obviously its from the john wick's director. Duuh 🤦‍♂️
john wick parody!
"Don't call 911... Better Call Saul".
Ohh this is going to be something.
Two arabs singing in the background
open
In Theaters Only.. wow really where i from everything i lockdowned... bruhhh this sux...
This would be good, can't wait
Well I think we cannot call nobody...
I think David leitch is going to make a movie in which john wick will fight nobody and they were old friends but the high table has screwed both
Basically john wick with a family and sarcasm🤷‍♂
At 2:29, there is a reference to Wexler McGill. The mug says WM.
He'd probably need a lawyer at that last clip, so he better call Saul
Вот это хочется посмотреть. Классный трейлер.
The amount of Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul references in the comment section is why I look up this video once in a while...
U want a hitman to take caer of ur problems? Better call saul
ahhhhh bootleg breaking bad
What a soundtrack man.....after a long time
First Comedy, then Drama and now Action? I think Odenkirk is aiming to BE EPIC in every Genre!
yeah saul's grown up
I'm suing for copyright, you can't just steal the story of my life and profit from it!
Better call Saul fans came to watch this wonderful jhon wick shit in crappy lawyer turned fugitive 😂😂
Jesus Christ according to this comment section, this movie is just another rip-off of ____. But the movies I'm seeing people claiming this movie ripped off from, were rip offs of movies made 20 years before that. As if in the late 90s and 00s all of a sudden all these very original premises and genres were created by these crappy movies you see today in the clearance bin at the dollar store. Someone actually used "Payback" as a movie that could have influenced future films for years to come lmao. I want all you guys that have very limited movie knowledge, Check out some movies from the 1970s. Start with "Death Wish"
this has potential to be made into a series of comics
this is the boogieman that john wick killed
“The assassins go on a murdering spree to avenge his pet back” genre
In My Mind - JOHN WICK ( Breathtaking Scenes)  https://youtu.be/aifAAN2fM4o
Liam Neeson in the comments: I don't know who you are, but you took my job! now i will find you! and i will be the part of this movie!
Isn't that Aleksandr Pal on the bus in the yellow at 1:03?
“I WiSh ThEy WoUlDvE PiCkEd My PlAcE U KnOw”   AGGRESSIVELY SWINGS IN THE AIR😭
You don't kill John Wick's dog !! You don't still Mr. Nobody's cat !!
Who else came from Kong vs Godzilla
This is just sakomoto days
Don't call 911, better call Saul👍🏽
Inside us all is an anger and a darkness push any person far enough and you will find it
Shane they made this a comedy, otherwise it had potential, they made this more “threat level midnight” than “ John wick”  sadly.
No, all I can picture is Conan O'Brien going all John Wick, this is not good. Hollywood, you people suck.
Hope he uses pencil to kill people
This just doesn’t suit Saul Goodman at all man lol
Good thing he is a lawyer too.
i know the guy who know the guy
Another movie about a white man solving "problems" with his fists. Thumbs down!
Baby siamese cat was needs an award.
Wow
turkish interests
I know it’s a meme to say this is what happened to x character after Breaking Bad, but this movie is just what happened to Jimmy, after he left with the cleaner to start a new life, but even after starting a new he can’t seem to get himself out of trouble, and since Mike, and Walt, are dead he has to man up, and learn to fend for himself.
Better not call Saul?
Did they CGI Sauls jaw line?
Bob Odenkirk is an action hero now!?!??!  Ok, I'm in...
nobody: nobody:
Better Call Nobody.
Woww, looks like Saul finally is fed up with being bullied around and has now became alpha
The Better Caul Sauls season 6 trailer looks sick
We get saul and Mike in this
Mister Shoot with Bob and Keanu.
John Wick 20 years after wedding.
This better be a John wick expanded universe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Can anyone identify the track from 1:13
Read comedy of coffin on kindle (farce)
I can see this living in the same storyline/universe as John Wick...
America, if Trump doesn't get convicted.
I hope this is in the same universe as Wick.
1:36 the daughter's expression.😂
Ha, he actually reloads the MP7 similar to how JW2 flips out the magazine of his G17 in the second movie near the final showdown.
Please just put this on Netflix, or something like. I dont like sharing the cinema when I have a tablet.
Happens in the JW universe, looks like it.
I already knew there will be a line: "It's just a fucking kitty cat."
Ive seen this movie 100 already
Nobody : Nobody :
A History of violence meets John Wick.
Beware if Ben the Accountant and Bob the Auditor come knocking...
Please release this movie in India with hindi dubbed 🙏🙏
Holy Fuck. Ilya Nashuller? This looks promising, even if it's another "super killer forced out of retirement" story.
What if John Wick and Hutch exist in the same universe... is that Hitmanverse?
Moral of the story - Don't ever hurt a struggling attorney's feelings.
This looks fun.
Is it just me or is anyone else wanting this to be something like the MCU, like John wick could eventually get to fight Saul. (Yes I’m aware that this movie will probably not connected, but I’m gonna keep my hopes up)
"My name is nobody"-Odysseus in the Odyssey.
Jimmie!
Will this be good I hope so
sorry to be so superficial, but Bob Odenkirk is looking f*ckin hot in this.
Wow, the trailer for -A History of Violence-  -Death Wish- -Red- -John Wick- Nobody looks good!
Totally gonna watch this, this actor deserves the support of this movie. It will go down as a classic action........This is what Saul did when he left.
Saul Wick
Oh damn! That’s a brilliant move. Bob Odenkrk is known throughout the land as Saul....someone decided to turn him into a person that would have had run ins with the people Saul represented in BB. This is like when Quintan lassoed John Travolta in pulp fiction.
I am all over this! Looks so awesome and I love Bob Odenkirk
I saw this trailer before Promising Young Woman. I feel like I saw the film already. Trailers suck because they just can't help but give everything away. I'll still see it though. Dad bod John Wick.
Call saul goodman 💪🏻
He looks like he's currently undergoing Chemo....   sorry I'm not buying it!
Interesting BGM Laalaa
Show time folks.
This movie could take place in the John wick universe and it wouldn’t even be out of place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Just amazing
Someone stole your kitty cat bracelet well then  You BETTER CALL SAUL
I didn't know saul goodman was trained lol not bad sir!
if max payne was a real movie
Beautiful actress
this is so hollywood. I actually thought at the bus scene it was going to be about this guy controlling his rage. Turns out he beat the guys then has to kill more after his past haunts him
Good actor!
Superb one! NOBODY 👌👌👌     ------ Listen to Nature💚💙 as well

I guess working at the Cinnabon wasn't the only thing he did after changing his identity.
man this is a good trailer I can't stop watching it
Essentially John Wick but he has something to protect.  Not saying it’s bad or a rip off I actually am very interested in this movie
Dices que existe un multiverso
Esta pelicula promete
This awkward feels like John Wick 4 if it wasn't John wick ..but if John wick had a family?..lmao I felt like the Producer for John wick kinda went to john wick with this ..feels awkward bolted on .😂
A comedic John Wick, where family and dog stays alive!
This is gonna be great, can't wait !
Haha YouTube funny word  Is very funny ok  Nobody:  Look funny word with the two dots.    Pls laugh.
Better call Wickman
I remember this guy from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul
Oh look,  another Mary Sue who has every ability!
BETTER CALL SOUL
when the guy you're fighting has a gun and unloads the bullets...run
john wick but with less hair
bruh i want a universe surrounding this and john wick
what's the song that plays?
Saul Goodman : "I am the Danger"
Why does this look CGI
Always get happy whenever they show Smiths on screen and they are pre Hillary Hole ones. Haha
When you quick scope in Cod and get a lucky triple kill - 2:36
John Wick: They killed my dog Nobody: They took my daughter's kitty Cat Next movie:  Donald Trump: They remove me from President
The name's Body, No Body
0:29 The tumbler looks like it has the logo of Wexler-McGill
I see a team up in the future bet in time they are gonna release a few different characters or maybe introduce them into through this film or the next and they are gonna get together with Keanu Reeves and Hally barry to take down the organization that wants their death
This movie is going to seriously fucking rock.
Damn!
When the boys at school laugh at my crocks:  0:59
This is the moment Saul Goodman became nobody
SHITE
I can't wait to see this movie!
Ok this is a version of John wick in a comedic universe, still awesomely beautiful
Jesus christ it's nobody
So nobody is going to talk about how that dude just got a triple quick scope kill. 2:37
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET >:(
I just found John Wick's brother!
When John Wick doesn't answer, Better Call Saul.
"In theaters February 26th"  Oh nice, a free birthday gift for me!
this actually looks good
I really hope this takes place in the same universe as John wick
This is a movie you sit around with your friends with and make fun of.
"In theaters February 26"  Covid:
he's gonna need a lawyer...
"THE BOOOGEYMAN"
I'm not 100% sure of this but that may be Keanu Reeves in the top left corner of the Nobody 2021 movie poster: http://www.impawards.com/2021/nobody_xlg.html
Посмотрим, насколько получился фильм от российского режиссера. Вот если бы они связали эти вселенные Джон Уик и Никто, было бы любопытно.
can anyone recommend movies like this?
He’s gonna need a good lawyer..  ;)
I’m hoping this takes place in the same universe
Mr Show with Bob and David
I know the John Wick similarities are obvious, but any movie that learns about how to do action from John Wick is doing something right. And it’s not like John Wick was the first to do this type of story.
That fuckin' nobody is John Wi...oops sorry, wrong franchise.
“That fucking nobody is...”
2:37 Quick Scope triple collateral
Had me at 1:29 seconds in , and the producer of John Wick ? Say no f%*ing more 😍😍😍
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Русский актёр...
They made movie on me nice
Saul
- Dont call 911 This isn't gonna end well for someone!
"Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!!" Best line in this trailer. *Fight me.*
In theatres only? Good luck with that.
Best movie trailer of all time!! This better be part 1. Where's the trailer for Nobody part 2?
Hello offices of jimmy mcgill he’s not available at the moment
If the equalizer and John wick had a baby
This man will do whatever it takes to get his daughter's kitty cat bracelet
Saul wick
I guess Saul Goodman became a badass, huh?
No NO NO, Bob Odenkirk is a masterful actor in the role of a manipulative ethically challenged lead character. The genius behind the scenes, the puppetmaster. He is not a badass action hero. Do not dilute him with this John Wick spinoff.
This seems like a comedy, I'ma watch it
Saul is pissed.
So nobody’s talking about how good Bob looks? 🥺 Okay... 🙄
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Saul Breaking BADDER
this movie looks amazing
Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!!!!
saul be like "you took my kids kitty cat bracelet" you dont fucking do that man
This is directed by the Hardcore Henry guy???? Yezzz pleeeease
Now that I've seen the trailer, there's no need to see the movie.
Saul good, man
EPIC OST MUSIC?
aww Christopher Lloyd  :)
I hope Ilya is going to make songs for this movie too
we are nobody
I kinda like the whole "he didn't beat on the dime burglers, so he must not be a real man" angle, its very real world issue in a time where men are supposed to be gentle and in touch with their feelings, while still demanding alpha male behaviour and condemning it at the same time.
I look forward to this movie, trailer is awesome!
So it’s a... John Wick
A son mistaken born from JoHn WiCk and his name is NoBody WiCk
John Wick knockoff... with fists instead of guns
2:25  Bad Ass (Kitty Bracelet)
John wick be like  oh there is someone iam searching 😂
Better call Saul can kick some ass! No wonder he quit making Saul.
A Better Call Saul Movie + John Wick HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! nice wan!
Oh, no! SJW hell! A strong heterosexual white male fighting back!
Not the first and (I hope) not the last time - but the MUSIC does the thing!
Song?!
WOw SaMe AcToR aS BreAkInG BaD AnD ReMiND Me Of JoHn WiCk.  Fuck me people say something original instead of just making references to other shit.
Hell of a movie trailer.
History of Violence 2?
"So there's this big action movie coming out starring Bob Odenkirk." "Oh so its an action movie spoof?" "No, its got some funny lines and such but its a legit action film." "Seriously?" "Well its made by the same people who did John Wick." "Oh..."
This trailer litterly gave away the whole movie 🤦‍♂️
"Auditor" looks more like the Exterminator to me. LOL
song name?
We all have a little bit of Goodman in us, criminals won't understand this!
Jhon wick dad
Yep. That’s Illya Naishuller’s Work.  And I love it.
I guess Saul had enough of working at Cinnabons!
Think I just saw the whole movie...
A think it's not going story be good but action it's have to be cool
What I want to know is the name of the song in this because it's fantastic
BADASS
"Somebody call an ambulance.......      BUT NOT FOR ME!!"
what is the music used in the trailer can somebody please tell me the name of the song?
Can't wait
2:37 damn mans got a collateral
https://youtu.be/CUHKSswsbaw
The Siamese Kitten at 2:47
Came here just for the Saul jokes.🤣🤣🤣
Excuse me.....what theaters
The dislikes are people with no brain  XD
A poor man's John Wick
They took the kitty Kat bracelet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣owww shit here we go again
keep these kinda movies coming.🔥
“In theaters only”.   Must not want to make much $$ then.
when u have the last pizza slice or hotpocket
Better than jon wick.
2:34 - Kevin Costner @ 80% width
Name of foreign song? TIA
this looks good cause every dads dream.  i am still excited about  it
John Wick and Nobody Crossover Movie??? 🤔
i like this trailer 😎movie is definitely gonna be fun exciting very good  fight and action
I'd prefer a feature spinoff about Gene rather than this. Event if it's dull and one-dimensional as El Camino...
I'm definitely calling Saul from now on.
An Equalizer, a Foreigner, and a Nobody walk into a bar...
Mom I want John wick  Mom: we have John wick at the house  John wick at the house:
2:34 my guy hit a sick triple collateral
Reminds me of a movie called History of Violence. I liked that movie and this one looks enjoyable as well.
“That fucking nobody is John Wick”
Welcome to John WickVERSE!
John wick "Just for laugh" edition eh?
Better Call Nobody
Ilya Naishuller's direction and style looks impressive. Backed by the team behind the John Wick franchise, Nobody looks like a must-see movie. 😷👍🌟🎥
From The same producer John Wick, 2:04 Gold bar looks like the same in the movie John Wick.
In early 90s Serebryakov was like Chuck Norris in USSR with his Kid in "Fan" movie. So it's some kind of legend.
So this the alternate time line where John gets the family he wanted but still ends the same way with him killing someone for taking something they never thought he would care about 😁
Oh shit this seems interesting
Can't wait for Feb 26th!! #BetterCallNobody
John Wick verse.
Very very on the fence about this. It both looks good and horrible at the same time
better not call saul. fucking nobody
Don't call 911, better call Saul
"Is there anyone in the world faster than him?" "Faster than him? Nobody!" -- From a certain spaghetti western...
Looks kinda gay.
Proč ten popis vypadá jako Fallout? 8)
“They stole my kitty cat bracelet”
0:28 Wexler and McGill Advertisement
Somebody called Saul.
I just  watched the whole movie with this trailer😂🤣
Saul becoming a total bad ass.
I can't wait for the next John Wick style movie featuring Jonathan Banks.
i wish these NOBODY could be a universe and connected with john wick :D
I have already watched it more than 10 times
TOP. I STOLE THA BRACELET
J.W  Good luck  With this  Mtff
Jhon Wick Has become the Dark souls of movies. "a movie like jhon wick" "a game like dark souls"
what is the song playing... when he beats up the guys in bus....
Are they building a John Wick Universe? Because, I'm SOLD.
Whoa so John wick has a universe now? Hell yeah!
Dang Walt and Jesse really did a number on Saul
Eyyy mike’s here too! @0:40
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I Seariously had to SHUT my mouth that hanged so much for 2 minutes that it was almost dislocated.
needed to say this movie made by the same russian director who filmed Hardcore Henry
awesome
Alright so Saul just switched roles with Mike and I am very here for it.
2:25
TLOU II Aggressive gameplay!
Yes.  This is exactly why I try to solve conflicts with words, and quickly walk away if I can't.  Cuz if I don't...
When a nobody breaks...bad!
who enters a room without looking left or right with a gun?
It’s James McGlick, cousin of John Wick!
If John Wick isn’t available Better call Saul...
GIVE HIM THE BRACELET
I thought they had taken tugboat🤣🤣
Bob Odenkirk is an exceptional actor. I really really hope that this movie is as big of a hit as I'm hoping it to be. I don't care if it's a John Wick rip-off, Supporting Bob all the way.
Nobody better call Saul
I think this would be john wick if he's wife didn't die
John Wick is a masterpiece
İf you are an retired killer and someone attacked to your family   BETTER CALL SAUL
Who's here for bob odenkirk aka saul Goodman aka jimmy😍
So they couldn’t afford Keanu any more? Too bad...
@1.13 i dont know what he's saying but its so apt for the action lol
*The usual killer/protect family/past violent life cliché.*
So its Hitman verse with John wick and Nobody.....hope it turns out that way
It's like some dad trying to be John Wick but fails miserably to have the same charisma (but has everything else) Thank you for reading my synopsis of the movie, have a nice day
"I am gonna fuck you up"
One just doesn't steal a man's Kitty cat bracelet.
Did anyone else think this was a saul Goodman movie?
John Wick Prequel HAHA.  Can't wait.
So this is what happen when John Wick have a family after 10 years LOL
I swear if c19 fucks this release up... I'm going ape shit kitty cat bracelet 😤
Someone finally made a movie about those annoying "NoBoDy" comments
The fact that this and John wicks universe might be connected is amazing. Imagine John asks him for help. And its just to set the plot
Dr Em Brown, kool
I think he’s part of the John wick universe if you pause at 1:25 and look at the pics of the 2 dudes they may be Russians
John wick vs nobody John Wick 4  Or  They team up to kill the high table
What Gene did after the Cinnabon closed
I just realized, this is the f**king director of Hardcore Henry!
Hey look, Saul Goodman is doing a Walter White
JOHN WICK, AMERICAN ULTRA....THIS IS IN THE SAME LEAGUE...LOOKS GREAT
LOL, GIVE ME THE GOD DANG KITTY CAT BRACLET
I just listen to this song and theme over and over. I do this instead of spotify
What if Wick and this guy teamed up, they would the most badass duo ever...
John Wick with his daughter's cat kidnapped
The song is Louis Prima - Just A Gigolo / I Ain't Got Nobody https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkrb4h4weW4
Wonder which platform it will show on in UK, SKY Box office, amazon, netflix? As cinema in tier 4 aint happening
He's punching like "one puch man".
I know a guy who knows another guy, who knows another guy.......
who the Fxxx are you?  saul good man!!
It'sAllGoodMan
🖤🤍
Just give my man the bloody kitty cat bracelet!
Yeah this is cool and everything but    When are we getting the final season of better call Saul
OMFG, Saul became a badass! I can't wait to see it now!
This looks awesome
So if this movie turns out to be good, imagine trying to tell somebody you saw an ace movie called Nobody, this movie looks great, I’m not trying to turn it down, but I genuinely didn’t think there would actually be a film called Nobody
So, John is still stuck inside of V's head and they just started from scratch with Saul?
Reminds me of a mix of John Wick and Badass.
it's like if john wick had a family.
theaters only...  nope
Man any other actor I'd of been like meh
Soundtrack 🙏
Nobody: Virgin Nobody the movie: C H A D

Never should have taken the damn kitty cat bracelet
That fight scene looked pretty fake.
better call Saul when you go Breaking Bad. John Wick: They killed my Dog Saul Goodman : they took 20 bucks, an Old Watch and my kids kitty cat bracelet
"I am Nobody"- Odysseus
I'm nobody but respect me 😁
I think have seen this movie for john something .......🤔
This looks like it's going to be mini episodes of Quantum Leap.   I'll pass
Awesome soul goodman..... remember you from breaking bad.
Imagine Nobody is in John Wick 4 fighting along side John Wick that would be fucking amazing.
Better call nobody... you hear?! >:(  Jokes aside, Bob Odenkirk looks like Jackie Haley (actor for Rorschach) in this movie
Nobody is actually John Wick who got sick and old after waiting so long for Cyberpunk 2077
Nobody:
kohn wick ? without the dog?
Thanks for saving me money! I just watched the entire film in a 3 minute trailer.
whats the name of the song in the background
Keanu Reeves : want to watch my action in different character.   David leitch : As u wish 😎🍺.
Next level movie, amazing trailer
naisuuuu another john wick movie, but this time we have family members....
damn
Eyes wide open. Mouth agaped :-)
This kind of movies about wanton, unrestricted and unreasonable violence is one of the many reasons for the shit-show happening in people's heads nowadays.
so is this a parody to John Wick?
But can he kill with just a pencil?
I’m actually nobody
lmao the bus scene is straight rip off from the joker lol
Imagine this Guy and John wick team up and kill the High table together in John wick 4.
Dad-assery has been a genre for a while. This is peak for that genre and I can't wait for it.
0:29 Wexler-McGill?  Theres no way they didn’t do that on purpose
Look Ahh Cause You Dont Look OK🤣
cant wait
This has great meme potential
John wick calls sal
jhon wick on vacation
This is literally the plot of the A History of Violence?
no animals died during the making of this movie
Saul had enough
hey try  Mere Xpression get the app

My lawyer is back.Its good to see mike is still alive.

Nobody: Literally Nobody
Is Derek Kolstad able to write *anything* besides John Wick? I mean, I'm not complaining or anything.
What is the name of the song in this trailer????
At first I thought it was John Wick parody
If your a liberal does this make you cringe?
Saddy Jhon wick
This is John Wick's uncle, Jimmy Wick.
I can't freak wait.
Man I love Ilya naishuller
Best quote so far: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!
so this begs the question, who would win between him or wick
Genre: John Wick Movie: "Nobody" 👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
Stupid Chuck, I'm ballin'
nobody:  literally nobody:
All i see is Saul.
I wish I was this guy
I want to know who the hell would steal a kitty cat bracelet
This better not be a movie where the trailer is absolutely amazing and the movie is trash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Nerf wars for kids:
“I’m nobody”- Charles Manson
I love odenkirk but they need to have a younger dude for these types of movies. He’s almost 60. Like can they pick a dude who’s 40-45?
Sauullll goood mannn
I really hope this is Saul after he got a new identity
what the hell he is angry on garbage, man just leave it a night before they come
I want to see it
yah saul got balls
This is the best trailer I have watched in a very long time😄
john wick's alter ego..
wish this could've been a breaking bad movie
Remember when Lalo Salamanca said : *You're Nobody*
My name is Angela, I live in UK..I am here to say a big thank you to (Dr DAVID WILSON for helping me and making me smile again, after reading a lot of testimonies about him i wrote him and told him to help me restore my marriage as my home have been scattered for 2yrs now, He replied my email and told me to send my pic and my husband pic and some other things, which i did and he said he will be done in 48hrs, with hope i slept and on the 3rd day my husband called me and asked if i could pack my things to his place and forgive him, i was shocked and this is how Dr DAVID WILSON helped me in restoring my home Contact him davidwilson511242@gamil.com,or Whats App (+234 9154632945) If he did mine he will do yours.....
Is that kitty cat bracelet or is it kitty cat, Bracelet?  Is it a kitty named Bracelet or is it a bracelet?
John Wick requires assistance of Nobody in John Wick 4.
Some people have big strong muscles. Some people just got thick ass bones
Ilya, I know you're a musician yourself, thanks for Louis Prima tune exposure, its a masterpiece! :) Song from the trailer: https://youtu.be/Kkrb4h4weW4
Saul Goodman
Same makers as John Wick, he has a title like an "auditor". The higher ups found out he came back, like John Wick did. I'm hoping to see him in John Wick 4.
I can't wait until this comes out!
Better call Saul!
old man wick
Say Hello To *JohnWicks* brother
Better call Saul
So..... From Saul Goodman to Nobody... I never saw that coming
“Note”:the ability they have uses bullets via removing the clip...then you get speed, durability and strength boosts
So john Wick is a actual genre. Nice
Anybody coming from Mitski's -nobody?
In Theaters Only February 26. What theaters?
This dude is definitely a Republican.
The lady of heaven , Trailer 😭😭😭 https://youtu.be/1MaDAW0jRYM
My name is Saul Saul nobody
This is the moment Jimmy McGill turned into Flynn
i think he will join john wick in next movie
Another John Wick...no thanks
For the first half of the trailer I thought this was gonna be a sad drama about Bob Odenkirk as a dad whose family hates him. Then John Wick showed up
I've been seeing some good trailers for the past year but not the movies
Give me the f***king kitty cat bracelet lmao
even after watching this trailer I still have no idea what this movie's about
He on some hotline Miami shit
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY-CAT BRACELET!!!!  Good lord...this is going to be EPIC!!!
I was so very hoping he'd be an average joe who pops under the pressure of society and his family poking him to do better. No previous training, no "used to work for bad people," just an average nobody with an average job who's tired of being everyone's doormat.   Kinda like Joker but methodical instead of insane.  Kinda like Boondock Saints but one man. Kinda like all of us who are about ready to pop under the pressure of these damn lockdowns.
John wick x a history of violence
American and phonier version of The Family Man
This is the moment where Saul Goodman becomes mike Ehrmantraut.
Is this story of John Wicks dad??
Jhon Wick 3.0
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUPDc5OUo6JkoOEOnKtHUVw new trailer :)
So... this is a remake of John Wick or what are we calling this? Not complaining, I'll be watching it anyways.
Am I the only one who's watched this like 50 times!!?!?  It's edited so well
Dang this gonna be boom
It's seems like John wick series film
Haleba lebaaaaaaaaa haleabala halebalebaaa halebalala...lol such a great song for a "F* yeah" moment...
Instead of having coffee in the morning now, I just watch this trailer and I'm ready to take the day on.
Strong Father movie !☺
Moral of the story: don't steal something from a man with a particular set of skills. He can bring the hell down upon you.
that fucking nobody is "nobody"
GIVE UP THE GODDAMN KITTY BRACELET
The "boogeyman",before john wick
Nobody:  Nobody:
As soon as I saw this was from the guy who made Hardcore Henry my urge to see it increased.
is this john breaking bad wick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Need a will ? Call McGill
Imagine John Wick, Robert McCall, and this Nobody guy in the same movie

I really want to support this movie but idk how I feel going to a growded movie theater in February. My area is still spiking in cases :/
Polyphemus: "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!?!" Bob Odenkirk: "I'm Nobody"
I’m just here for the Saul Goodman references.
Who’s excited for nobody
Should've been called, My Angry Dad
Finally see Saul fighting not talking his way out of troubles.
I’m convinced Mike possessed Saul Goodman
John Wick's also retired hitman uncle
Another movie with MC made of steel fantasy and is about being badass.
Saul Goodman’s continuing arc after breaking bad
Russian Mafia runs into wrong guy again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
old john wick
Heavy Bruce Willis vibes.
Is this now part of the John wick Universe? The "babayaga" universe?
2:03 They showed the gold bricks just like the ones in John wick
Yes
Can‘t wait for the article: Nobody is whats wrong with western masculinity today 😁😁
Flug, this looks terrible.
Holy Fuck Holy Fuck What the Fuck. I feel like a 14 year old again. The only trailer that blew me away like this in a long long long time.
Saul Goodman has become Saul Badman
Awesome teaser
This is basically a movie about a janitor, dishwasher or even a bellboy who works at the continental being wronged and seeking revenge! not as skilled and professional as the front desk guy who works at the continental but is still a badass assassin!
better call wick
Bgm was awesome👏👏
What its the same jhon wick story
I feel like i've seen this before.
glade to see I wasn't the only one who thought of John Wick! And from the producers OF John Wick? Come on
Shit looks good
This looks really interesting.  Surprised it's being produced by a major studio.
Meh... He's a nobody.. bet his name is John white.
Sure producer of john wick but what about the director of Hardcore Henry!
yup
Better call hutch
Nobody call saul😄
Hey hey,,,,trailer got me hyped up. I'm down with nobody,,must see. Happy 2021 everybody, & thanks from Brooklyn yo.

Can somebody please find the theme song? Im dying😭
When you pay a lot of money to Ed Galbraith...  Better Call John Wick

John wick prequel Boogeyman
This is where Jimmy McGill becomes Heisenberg
Exciting
wait a minute that's my steam name- are you saying i could have been a god damn movie all these years?
He didn't finish the statement. "In Theaters Only ..When the Pandemic Ends".
2:26 i have to go see this movie XD
John wick style action? ✔️ Clint Eastwood Gran Tarintino voice and demeanor? ✔️ 6/10 story, that will make you probably wish you’d have stayed at home because this movie will look like 27 other movies you’ve already seen had a love child? ✔️
love.
2,4k use to be a assassin cant get trash out in time
Let's admit .. we all kinda wanted to see this version of Saul Goodman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
There's lot of talent behind this film. Since the actor of Saul in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, to the producer of John Wick, the director of Hardcore Henry... AND TOBEY MAGUIRE!!! This film will be awesome
This is gonna be part of the John Wick universe. Heard it here first
Ok im thrilled.
Better Call Saul meets John Wick!
*I thought at first this was a taco bell ad*

Nobody 2: No body. Just buddy.
You don't want a criminal lawyer, you want a criminal lawyer
Better Call Saul season 6 looks WILD
He is Fast and Furious  nobody 🤔??
I should better call Saul.
I will watch this movie because it is directed by Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry) and because the protagonist is Bob Odenkirk 😁
Bob Odenkirk has some greatttt characters
Everybody is a somebody.
Looks like jimmy found a new identity, he can’t seem to stay out of trouble 🙄
I can't quite figure out if it's meant to be a comedy or not. I keep laughing through the whole thing.
Better call saul!!
Saul goodman!!
John Wick could take him. But he would probably lose an eye or a hand taking him down.
That fucking NOBODY is JOHN WICK
John Wick has been declared as a movie genre... 😁
In case no one noticed, the henchman at 1:14 is played by the same actor/stuntman as the Russian bodyguard that nearly killed John Wick at the Red Circle nightclub in John Wick 1.  This is most likely due to the reuse of actors in Hollywood movies or... Nobody is a prequel to John Wick 1.
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE....A LAWYER
I lost 😔 my friend and I wrote this song 💔           https://youtu.be/R3SOo5voQpw
Well, I better call Saul
Producers labour the point when they make tens of similar movies that has been succesfull
Damn, we shoulda voted for nobody.
What it's like in Bryan Callens mind LOL
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please accept Jesus Christ as your lord and your savior.
I was laughing when he said “where’s the kitty-cat bracelet”
This guy is like John Wick's retired cousin
I am really hoping this is in the John wick universe
Which is that sooong🥵
I’m starting to feel bad for these actors trying to float these horrible movies.
Saul John Wick.  Hold my Coffee Cup.
Thick44: You're damn right you are.
John wick vs nobody
Saul Goodman 😳
Omg.
killed dog,cats bracelet next girl friend or  wife's bracer stolen😪😲
Saul is done being a compromised lawyer
A trailer that was actually interesting!  If this guy and John Wick aren't in a crossover...
Home Alone: Eff Off.
Glad to see Bryan Callen has gotten his acting career back.
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET had me dying lol
Better call Saul season 6 is crazy.
Glad to see Bob in something else besides “Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad”
Everyone mentions John Wick but this movie is basically the plot from History of Violence.
Death wish X John Wick?
better call Saul!
Wow Saul :DD
hearing "In Theaters Only" feels like a very macho declaration in these times
Director - Made Hardcore Henry/ founder of biting elbows. Writer - Wrote the John Wick series Actor - Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad This movie has a lot going for it.
anybody know the song that was playing around the time he is fighting those low-lifes on the bus is?
So we're just bot gonna talk about how someone is gonna get a triple collate quickscope in this movie
They literally showed the whole movie already
Cursed john wick
lol
Isn't anyone going to say "History of Violence"?
After All , It's All Good Man !!

Here's hoping that he says "it's all good man" at the end of the movie
This movie is literally gonna be the "Nobody:" meme format
Mans playing superhot
Basically, an alternate universe in which John Wick's wife did not die.
Soooo Jon Wick
So this is basically Michael from Gta 5
whole background music please
yes liberal are nobody(s)  nothin new here folks
This is the one that trained John Wick how to be John Wick!!!
This looks like a blast. Definitely going to see it once it comes out
The lady of heaven , Trailer ،   https://youtu.be/1MaDAW0jRYM

Saul Goodman!!!!
Whats the song played from 1:14 minute?
This looked promising but then it just turned into Odenkirks vanity project.
Imagine he appeared in John Wick 4
This is like an alternative world where walter white is the lawyer and saul is the king pin
What the hell happened to saul...
ineed that background music in bus  fight
It like Hitman but have a family and skill like John Wick
Slipping Jimmy
So we've officially made John Wick a _genre_ now?  Cool.
Looks stupid
Saul ? saul????!
Yang milih Allah SWT like.
Nobody Does It Better

#Draculauntold2
I can't stop watching this trailer
someone can tell me if it is a film or a serie?
better call saul after this one
this thumbnail its exactly like John wick 2 but without guns and this dude actually gets beat.
i guess Saul had it enough.
We need a dark version of home alone where Kevin is a special forces and makes equipment to take down bad guys. Lol
HOPE 🙂  Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  Visual Bible movies on YouTube !!!  🙏🙂🙏🙂🙏🙂🙏🙂 ❤️✨🇺🇸🤍✨🇺🇸💙✨🇺🇸
It something looks like John wick.
Holy Shit.. Saul with a gat... I'm, all in!
this comes out on my birthday what a great present
Thought this is based on Kurt Russell’s character from Fast and Furious!!

Call Saul! Movin on up in the world huh? Im watching this movie just cause.

I'm just interested in the fact that they used Just A Gigolo by Louis Prima
Better call.....Saul?
-Nobody. -Nobody 2 - Operation: Kingbreaker. -Nobody 3: Justice Matters Most.
in clip art he's like mocking John Wick. lol Guns surrounding John's face Punches surrounding Bob's face what's next kicks surrounding Tom Cruse face then dicks......on xvideos....lol
A man can take so much before they snap
Is this connected to John Wick?
I guess this guy will be representing him self in court if he ever gets arrested...
Everybody here is making jokes about Breaking Bad and John Wick and I’m just here being happy that Hollywood finally came with an original movie that isn’t a reboot or sequel. Also a very talented actor as the main lead
What is the name of the song in trailer?
I wish to listen this song
it's actually john wick screen writer guys not the director
Jhon Wick's replacement found. 😉😂
So , the producer is John Wick .
What the hell is going on here, what is this. Damn thats one hell of a TRAILER!!!!
Omg I'm waiting...
Producer of John wick what else ...🔥🔥
An awesome old man! 😜
https://youtu.be/TkGiluQWAfg
Oho... So cool
I want to see a face-off between Nobody and Gustavo Frings..!
Saul Wick
I have a feeling that this is secretly apart of the John Wick universe!
Don't Call 911
JESSE. WE NEED TO CALL SAUL.
Im in!!!!!
So is this like a dark parody? Or like a legit action thriller?      YES.
Jon Wick with family this time!
So it's basically John Wick but he talks more
song trailer???
*This what Keanu Reeves will look like when he is doing John Wick 47 at the age of 150 years*
Охуеть!

YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"....
HOLYYYYYYYYYYYY SHITTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!
"Nobody II - The Audit of Pedowood".
Hey dont be making movies before you finish better call saul
Why can't the bad guys leave these retired dudes alone? Nothing good can come from forcing them out of retirement.
Terence HIll is nobody
song ???
As an original Mr Show fan... it is weird as shit seeing Odenkirk do this
Better not call Saul!
oof
1:36
How original. Well I guess the 10 year olds and the mentally challenged have to be catered for.
how original...totally not like Taken, John Whick and The Equalizer.... this one is all about family,  fast and furious fans will love it
Saul shouldn't hang out with Mike that much.
Just wow! This time action speaks..
Suprrrbbbbbb
Plot twist : story written by Nobody
It’s like Rambo and John wick at this point
Whats the song in the background
it's like the Punisher went Breaking Bad
Tak čo asi menej čakať od tvorcov johna wicka ako totálnu akciu?
Better Brawl Saul
Apni maa ke liye 1❤ like to banta hai
be afraid of the built up anger of a common man :)
I hope it's good. Want to see a whole series.
Motherf*ckers could have avoided all of this if they didn't stole his daughter's kitty cat bracelet.
I just want to imagine this is the next life Saul Goodman ran into after Season 6.
Fuck this looks like fun.
I think he connected to John Wick..He the auditor. I want to see this movie so bad..
God Damn... this look fire
Great! Another Kevin Costner action movie.
So this is John Wick: Alternate reality?
I can't read the title without thinking about Charles Manson. Am i the only one?
1k subscribee zero video challenge
Give us more movies like this David Leitch!!!!
its god damn fucking good trailer :D
so basically john wick with an alive family
Wow Saul Goodman !!!  Is a Killer can wait to see it
He is a little slow with his movements.
John Wick 4 Winston ask John who you have that can help you John Responds I have nobody winston smiles..
I hoped it was his dream
No-body: just punchs

John Wick-Polar-Nobody : The holy trinity.
2:37  *"Oh Baby a Tripleeeee"*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTseTg48568
Definitely watching this!!!
Seen this trailer 5 times already, its just so good
Man that was sick 🔥 ..just stop comparing it to john wick and stop mentioning better call saul .. just enjoy and appreciate the work... even though the trailer is fucking awesome it has less views ;)  Didn't expected this kind of thing from him it's lit man 💥
Moral of the story: Don’t hang around meth dealers, chemists and fried chicken sellers.
0:28 is that a Wexler-McGill mug I see?
I'm excited for this!!!
I missed Saul Goodman!
Man I didn't know Saul Goodman can be so badass.
Can we see john wick? Universal: we have john wick at home
What song was that?
Yang milih allah like 800 ya yang milih dajal abaikan saja.
The backstory: John Wick got the idea that Saul wanted out. If Saul can do it, so can he.  But John's wife died, Saul got a family.
So John Wick but with Saul Goodman
Wait so Saul had a career change?
Who are you?  - I'm the lawyer of the man who knocks.
Why do they have to reveal the entire frikkin movie in the trailer goddammit!
Nobody's Perfect
Give me the God damn Kitty Kat Bracelet..... I lost it 😂
with all that crime going on, he's probably going to need a lawyer...
I hope Conan makes a cameo
0:41 is that Jonathan Banks? or someone else?
The great thing is that it feels like an old man is fighting.
Besides breaking bad references... This trailer looks bad ass
This guy better call saul

I'm just glad there's no dead pet in this movie
Maybe his mentor * jock wick's mentor
I hate everyone that mentioned breaking bad
Chill! It's all good, man.
Bg song🔥
Would be cool to see Bob Odenkirk on Joe Rogan talking about this role and training for this movie
Damn the fightd scenes look impactful and less cuts no shaky cam bs.
I thought he was a weeny in Breaking Bad... but man, I am SO looking forward to this bloody movie.
John Wick 4 looks interesting
So now we came to know why we didn't see lalo in breaking bad 🔥
Do you have someone that needs getting rid of?... Better call Saul!
Liam Neeson wants your location
I'm just imagining how the movie will look cause the trailer is so fucking lit 🔥
“Who the fuck are you?”  *”i’m John wick.................*   *....on a budget.”*
waiting the movie from philipines
so basically a  shonen anime.
I just got presented my best birthday gift from a nobody! 😂❤️
That fucking nobody is Joh..... sorry wrong movie
They better call saul for their lawyer
What's the song?  Anybody.. somebody.. Nobody !!
The comment section is literally gold
So is this a replacement for Liam Nelson? 😂
That background music is so cool..
Am I the only one that noticed his multiverse Wexler & McGill mug!! Cant wait!!
0:28 Wexler McGill
thanks for showing the whole movie, no need to go out on my way to pay to see it ;)
this looks like a johnwick rip off
David Lee Roth at least needs a Cameo !! 😏
This looks amazing 🤩
That background song!
The subdued pocket plausibly jail because john simultaneously juggle lest a voracious monday. momentous, petite gold
Kitty cat bracelets??!! Im sold!!..
Parallel John Wick.... dog replaced with kitty cat bracelet lol
0:28 Wexler/McGill reference?
We really need to stop with this "Only in theaters" BS, can we just do that? Thx
1:31 This is when Saul becomes Heisenberg
"😣They stole my kitty cat bracelet" 🏃 "Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!🔫"
turn off my Internet I can't stop watching this
The whole trailer is the plot. Just wait for the movie to watch the full cringe. Pathetic!!!
wow know the whole story now thx
He is the legend of better call saul 😭😭😭 Finally we will see u again
Seeing him in action fr!!
John Wick in a parallel universe!
Nice...
Powli
Honest Trailer: Suburban Dads Gone Wild. This looks great
Can u tell me the music name during fight??
Looks very similar to breaking bad IN A GOOD WAY!
Jordan Peterson?
Awesome acting...
yo I didn't know that they are making a film that is based on the life of the cousin of Jordan?!
Cant wait...
public disparage of Bob Odenkirk...  "...don't let yourself go, 'cause everybody cries, everybody hurts sometimes..."
When jhon wick is old
Is there going to be a Leitch-Stahelski Cinematic Universe?
Our Saul Goodman ❤️
Better call Saul Wick, man!
Man stays on the bus. 3 young, shit for brains start laughing. Oh dear. Now im gonna fuck you up. Classic.
Great movie. I just watched the whole movie in the trailer. Awesome!
I’m pumped for this
This genuinely look like a TRY-HARD B-movie fanboy shit of John Wick.
should of called Saul
This whole film genre started with a man with a very particular set of skills, now there's like 20 men with a particular set of skills and at this point it's getting a bit annoying.
Who are you? Me ? I’m Saul Goodman
Imagining that this is going to be a trilogy and on the third installment, he will have to go against John Wick
I'm in.
At least two Russian actors in this one
No Iko Uwais ? Hmm

He knows a guy who knows John wick
So now the one with the special set of skills is Saul, well, he did work for some very dangerous people
Looks boring, but it's Mr Bob and i love the dude so ill watch it
This movie looks good, I wished I didn't just see the entire thing.
New style of action sequence and story and direction.
The bracelet will be an excuse to keep the excitement going, a crux like johns dog without it its just meaningless violence.
Slippin' Jimmy finally lost it...
Nobody  Nobody Nobody does it better

bollywood tollywood ready for copying this movie😁😁😂
https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/John-Wick-Nobody-poster-comparison.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370   Watch this, the posters are so similar, if you think about the Nobody's gold bars, it feels the same way than the gold coins in John Wick
The new John wick?
investigator: who the fuck are you Sual: A jobless lawyer
u better call saul dude
How to make a DOPE movie, Give a man a GUN and a PET.
Plot twist: He's the Boogeyman and at the end of the movie John Wick kills him
Looks like he got into a real fight...  He should do himself a favor. If the cops come... better call Saul!
What if there is a crossover with john wick🔥
https://youtu.be/BIjdv2os2ZQ
Alternative title:John wick with a family
Nice!
Anyone noticed the gold shown. Same in john wick so are they in the same universe?
Friend of John Wick with a family, not a dog 😁
So this is Saul's new Identity
Is he mr. nobody from fast and furious saga?
"There's a long dormant piece of me that so very badly wants out...." I hope everyone can relate to it....
Nobody messes with Saul...
Better call saul!!
Oh f*ck what a trailer💥
Yang pilih allah like.
Nobody 2: The Fall of Tugboat
Holy Frick!!!!!!!What if this film takes place in the same universe as John Wick!🤯
I theatres only? Shut up and take my money. 💰
He knows a man who knows a man who knows nobody 🙂✌️
Who's can I call now? Any one better then Saul?
"Better don,t call soul"
Jon Wick "he killed my dog" Saul Goodman "they took my kids kitty cat bracelet"
Hell yeah. After so much male oppression in the US enforced by 'overpolitically correcting' the pendulum is finally swinging back.
Bruh I don’t care how stupid and cliché it looks: I’m watching it.
I HAAAAVE TO SEE THIS
This is basically what happened when I got back to Ithica from the Trojan War.
This looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A man, manning up, I'll fucking drink the toxic masculinity gladly.
He sounds so much like nathan drake aka nolan north
Too many Russians in Hollywood movie! 😂😎😆
I still can't tell if this is supposed to be funny or not. I guess I've watched way too much Mr. Show in my lifetime.
Looks like he’s using a mix of kali/panantukan and KFM in his fighting style, both very accurate for the scenarios he uses them in i.e. elbow strikes in close quarters, braced charges and hammerfists. Looks like our man did his homework
So this is what happened to Saul
Why are trailers so long these days? Feels like i've seen the entire movie in 3 minutes now with the trailer.
Lil song for y'all : https://youtu.be/AmRxE5u5ewo
He should act in a breaking bad movie
Обращение Бога🕶 20.12.2020 Катрен “Ваше движение только к Богу”  Приближается Исторический час Пик! История – вне желания человека! Для человечества неизвестности Миг! Встречаются вместе Два века!  Люди не понимают, что будет? Понятно только, что меняется Мир! Волнения эти никто из Вас не забудет! Вы – Боги и Бог для Вас ориентир!  Не мечтайте, что Вам люди помогут! Все люди из одного «теста»! Люди сами ничего не могут! Надежда на спасение, если все «вместе»!  Для спасения надо объединиться! Природное «вместе» – это спасение! Вам надо Единения от людей добиться, Ключевое слово: «Объединение»!  Так спасались люди не раз! Археология говорит об этом! В древней Истории Руси был сказ, Сегодня слово «вместе» забыто!  В капитале – каждый в отдельности! Называется: «выживание»! Из Союза Русь теперь – в неизвестности! Люди теперь в ожидании!  Пандемия готовит психологический мор! Правда чисел теперь запрятана! Для человечества определён коридор, Нет полной жизни, остались её пятна!  Человечество уже смирилось! Отдельные лишь драки с полицией! Русь внутренне почти развалилась, Она не может смириться с позицией!  Русь всегда тяготела к Равенству! Это было заложено ещё в Духе! Коллектива или Вече было главенство, Правили в древности страной Духи!  Переход из Союза в капитал не состоялся! Потеряна Суть Великой страны! Человек на Руси недолго маялся, Опасен для Руси опыт другой стороны!  Русь вспомнила Своё Начало! Святая Русь – пошла от Бога! Капитал превратился в печали, Божественные прервались потоки!  Время подошло – принимать решение! Капитал – ведёт Русь к смерти! Капитал – ведёт Русь и к унижению, Основа Руси – это Святой Дух, поверьте!  Теперь видно, что ждать уже нечего! Надо менять Суть поведения! С Создателем Вас ожидает встреча! Русь – это Нового Мира введение!  Вам надо срочно принять решение! Пять двоек на Небе через 2 дня! Создатель ожидает правильного поведения, Люди должны услышать Меня!  Что Бог ни делает, всё к лучшему! Главное, Ваше самостоятельное решение! Эти слова должны прозвучать дружно! Правильность этого – решит движение!  Ваше движение только к Богу! Нет никаких других решений! Поверьте, Вам Небеса помогут, Тьма не остановит Руси движение!  Внутренне Вы осознали решение! Бог подтвердил «Вместе» навечно! Теперь на Вече подтвердите мнение, Ради Победы зажгите Свечи!  Вы решили, что Вы в Боге! Нет дороги другой для Руси! В Новой эре – Вы не медведи в берлоге, А люди-Боги Новой Зари!  Аминь. Отец Абсолют.  20.12.2020 ...........
Что? Паль?
Been a long time since i enjoyed a trailer this much!
In theaters only, yeah right. By Feb 27th, you’ll be able to downstream it.

Killing John wick's dog is the biggest mistake, after that it's stealing the kitty cat bracelet
So Saul finally broke bad..

John wick vibes
Amigo del Cartel
What is the music at 1:14 can someone please tell me ?
Perfect.
Bollywoodstyle
Every guy with a dad bod wishes they could do things like this.
this was filmed in winnipeg
Saul Goodman...wow
Watch the main villain be Lalo Salamanca
haaaaaa haaaaaaa - what  r u b b I s h ...... only for the brain dead.
2:44 actor1 : who the fuck are u ?          Bob Odenkirk : I AM NOBODY .           me : of course he is nobody ....
I WANT TO SEE 'MR. NOBODY' fighting 'JOHN WICK'. Please make this happen!
When the lawyer profession didn't quite worked out.
dont call 911, better call hutch
I feel like there's no point for this movie to exist, unless it's related to John Wick's universe
At 1:34 he should have said "Better call nobody".
First i was like: yeah, thats a new spin on a drama flick. He could have taken out a robber but he didnt and now he has to live with some regret. Then i was like: oh shit. You dont steal a kitty cat bracelet from an auditor's daughter!
"Available only in theatres" confused me
Don't mess with tugboat.
He always loved hello kitty products 😂😂
Yeah mr saul yeah guns
Saul Godman is back with a bang 🤙
I don't know how many of you noticed but there was a split second where three triangles appeared in blue...(Illuminati)
Ne bu jhon wick mi
The only problem is that he too much like Mr. Wick and just looks like a copy of him. Even the way he talks.
Cheesy at it's best. The movie is shot so cool though.
They give up to much in trailers now. It’s like why watch the movie I just saw the best action scenes and the complete story line.
He gets arrested and declines council instead opting to represent himself at trial.
Goodman has become a nobody? Better call Saul.
Breaking bad actors: *on vacation* Movie studios: 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Better call Saul 🤷🏾‍♂️
Comon slipyjim
cant wait to see bob odenkirk fucks somebody up
The part he used to be a badass, ruined it for me. It would have been a lot cooler if he was just an average joe kicking ass.
Imagine the pieces sauls gonna have to pick up after this mess
" U know what you should do when someone breaks into your house?" "BETTER CALL SAUL"
I dont know he doesn't suit the role for me, all I keep seeing is Saul Goodman lol
Remember the quiet kid in class ?  This is him now. Feel old yet ?
-  I want John Wick + We have John Wick at home   The John Wick at home:

Good on Bob, heard he wasn't very confident in playing rough-Saul Goodman/Jimmy at first because it was a large step away from comedy. Look at him now
Better Call Saul, unavailable right now. :D
Punch Man
I can relate to the frustration.

Now that's what I call top action badass nothing like badass non stop action all the way threw!!!
JOHN WICK : FAMILY EDITION
But the million dollar question is: "Is this still canon to John wick series?"
This is all good, man!
Was that Christopher Lloyd aka ol Doc Brown in the recliner? Glad he's still working! Love that guy!
Slowly Hollywood is turning into our South Indian action movies.. 😂😂
This is what's gonna happen if John wick's wife would not died..
John Wick + Equalizer = Nobody
O this is looking like its to be a good movie
Old man Wick
I thought this was a trailer for season 5 of BCS... Was totally confused the first half of it. Looks great though.
Theaters are still a thing? Just let us purchase this in our homes.
Creators: IN THEATERS ONLY Covid-19: Am I A Joke To You?
Is that the same notorious saul?
Lawyer done lost his mind
This guy need a good Lawyer.......
Joker and John Wick got married.  *11 months later* John: Is it a boy or a girl? Nurse: Nobody
I thought he worked at a Cinnabun
Did the director behind the crank movie make this sh*t? Dafuq?
That part on the train reminds me of the movie joker
26 February is my birthday, guess it's a good gift lol
So it’s John wick but his wife never had cancer and instead of the dog it’s a kitty cat bracelet but he’s also an attorney ...
Dude, Bob Odenkirk f-ing people up! Count me in!
JOKER WICK i thought he is a nobody, but HE IS SAUL
Oh yes saul goodman is back
What type of homealone is this?
Boboddy
No one: Absolutely no one: Not a single soul:  Nobody: Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet!
The director of this movie also directed Hardcore Henry, so I'm pretty pumped for it.
The Auditor of John Wick
Isn't this just Red (2010)?
Hey new Kevin Costner movie! 🍿
God bless you all. The Gospel is 1Corinthians15:1-4=Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, HOW THAT CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES; AND THAT HE WAS BURIED, AND THAT HE ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES. Ephesian 1:13=In whom ye also TRUSTED, after that ye heard the word of truth, the GOSPEL of your SALVATION: in whom also after that ye BELIEVED, ye were SEALED with that holy Spirit of promise.  Ephesian 2:8-9=For by GRACE are ye SAVED through FAITH; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of WORKS, lest any man should boast. Romans 3:23-26=For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being JUSTIFIED FREELY by his GRACE through the REDEMPTION that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a PROPITIATION through FAITH in his BLOOD, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which BELIEVETH in Jesus. Without blood there is no life and without Jesus BLOOD no eternal life. https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Funny version of john wick. 😱
I know a great lawyer for this guy 😏
Bruhhhhhhhh I have to see it 😎👌🏻
When Joker & John wick has kid
I don't care for this I just want the next season of "better call saul"
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody, I want nobody nobody But You. Plot twist : Korean K-Pop girlband wonder girls.
Фильм, где Сол Гудман крушит отморозков, а Алексей Серебряков сыграл главного злодея - это куда круче корона-апокалипсиса за окном.
oh shit oh shiit  what an action its amazing
Same universe as John Wick
anyone know the song name?
... I guess it's whoever reaches for the pencil first ✏️
Давайте, Паль и Серебряков, покажите там, что такое бэд рашн гайз ))))
Wow !!! Lança esse filme por favor !!!! Não adia não  ha e manda aqui pro Brasil bonitinho em fevereiro lançamento global POR FAVOR !!!!
This producers are just getting too good
Everyone making a joke in the comment section Me: Nobody
Perfect 💪
Woman: All of this for a kitty cat bracelet ? Nobody: Wasn't just a kitty cat bracelet...
Seems like Saul upped his game
Solid trailer !
Awesome trailor but miss Keanu Reeves
The thing that got me hooked is the kitty cat bracelet
"PERSON OF INTEREST" IN DOLBY SURROUND SOUND...🎞📽🎥🎶💽📱💣🚬🎬🚨🚦🚥🚎🚔🚓🇺🇸
They said nobody is perfect, so I became nobody.  ~ Nobody
For anyone wondering, song is “Gigolo” by Louis Prima
someone better call saul for these antagonists!!!
And you cant kill someone with nobody!
you got problem? better call: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnHtGgVAUE
https://youtu.be/sD3VgUc2YF4 A COMMON MAN
It's not fair to keep labeling him as "Saul Goodman." If you know anything about the man, he was a standup comedian YEARS ago, was on various other shows, etc.  No idea why someone always has to live in the shadow of a specific character. Actors HATE that... Show some respect!
Theory: This guy is boogyman  who was later killed by John Wick, BUT PLOT TWIST, John Wick didn't kill him, he let him live his live, but assassin society discovered the truth and now they want to kill him and he will come back in John Wick 4 to repay him and we will see combo of those two fighting side by side and all hell breaks loose. Oh. And Hugo Weaving must play antagonist in John Wick 4, otherwise it doesn't make sense.
Bro why copy John wick
Better call saul is an action star now????
john wick mentor probably. because hes older
Better don't call nobody
Bulletproof Clothing: hierarchycompany.com
So proud of Saul.. 🔥😍
His family better call Saul
Damn Saul really stepped it up a notch
John Wick meets suburbia xD
Finally a great movie where Bob Odenkrik will have the spotlight.
U.P : Let's give humanity some good stuff next year. They need it.
Slippin Jimmy
Just imagine Nobody featuring in John Wick 4 and both become friends before the interval. and the rest will create history.
This is my father, getting inspired after John Wick
Polyphemus has entered the chat
Now go watch Death Sentence (2007)
Arthur after losing tugbot.
@0:40 is that him??
Saul, WTF?))
He looks like Bruce Willis with hair.
It's all good man 👌
A little piece of advise to Hutch . Do whatever You want, Kill whoever You want but dont kill dogs or John will kill You whether You are just NOBODY.
Daniel Bernhardt...wtf!! I thought he'd actually be the one to fuck up Saul Goodman
deadpool: your name??  nobody: ......nobody.  deadpool: what daaa *tiiiiit* thats a very cooooool name ever!!  join in???????   .......pliiiiiiis.
Its looks like shitty john wick and i love it.
What’s the name of the song playing throughout and the artist name? Does anyone know, especially the version used here ?
Home Alone reboot looking lit.
What's the name of song in background?
If this was actually part of the John Wick cinematic universe??? 🤯
I'm genuinely excited. Love this dude.
Saul finally broke bad!!!
Saul Goodman turns to real Badman. Next is : Say My Name
You should see other party....my childhood dialogue when i fight with someone..

Посмотрю из-за Серебрякова! Хороший актер!
Looks better than John wick
Breaking Bad 2. Saul is a Badass.
I'VE NEVER LOVED A MOVIE FROM ITS TRAILER SO MUCH LIKE THIS BEFORE
Beter call saul! He can talk you out of this :P
what a creamy crap
Wowww.
This is basically a rehashed ‘‘History of Violence’’.  Would have been better if he was actually a nobody who found out he had a nutt sack.
It's all good man.
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k future and what awaits us
Grada, fadu, bhut hard action trailer👌👌👌👌👌
So this guy brings a baseball bat into a gun fight?
Him vs John Wick I would like to see that
На 0:50 думал показалось. А нет, не показалось 0:55
So, this is another movie when it's one is versus everybody. And it'll make it to a part 3. Well, keep 'em coming 'coz we're all gonna be watching it anyway. 😅💪🤘✌️
"i have worked for few dangerous people .... " ....ya ya we knw you are saul goodman ..
Wooooo  i can't wait
*Plot twist:*    None. There's no plot twist. It's John Wick 4, but with a kitty bracelet instead of a dog. _Pity._
cliche'.... I had hjopes this would be an actual nobody. Just some random dude who is stressed out and loses it. maybe gets lucky and kills a few bad guys. Instead it's generic brand john wick.
He knows a guy who knows another guy.
OMG LOVE THIS FILM
Im gonna watch this. Its like my mood of 2020 translated into the movie
I love Saul Goodmann
he knows a guy who knows a guy
John: 🐕 and 🚗 Saul : hold my 🐈
Fake john wick

Maybe, the Lawyer job wasn't that good afterall. Huh, who knows?!
1:13 songggggg pls?
"Artillery" Arthur..
I was so hyped about some real "Joker" story and then I realized it is some kind of "A History of Violence" and "John Wick" ex super commando bleh...
John wick wannabe
Damn I didnt know Saul can play a bad ass character😂
So Saul Goodman is John Wick's mentor..🤔

Another Death Wish?
Oh fuck yes!
Saul wick
Kurt Russell: I thought I was Mr. Nobody.
Better call saul😃😃😃
2:46 i really hate when movies do this, anounce the title in the movie. You don't see Luke giving a speach at the end of a New Hope saying "Today, we begin, a war in the stars...a star wars. <end credits>.
JEST MOC
BETTER CALL SAUL.... 😂👌
“Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.” Jimmy McGill
“You wanna save your business? You wanna save your dignity? You’re gonna have to fight.” Jimmy McGill
Wwooooowww... ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sal Came With a Bang..
Low budget John Wick
O my goshhh, Saul Goodman turns in to a  war machine.
Middle aged men day dreaming during their bus ride to 9 to 5
Hell yeah.
2:45 Le :- walter white  he's my lawyer  Le jessi :-yaa bitch
SOMEONE GIVE THAT MAN A KITTY CAT BRACELETE!!!
So this is what Saul does when he's not being an attorney 🤣
What saul Goodman doing here🙄
Why why why you spill the plot like that?  Just why?????
Jhon wick cut his hair.

*BETTER CALL SAUL WICK*
From breaking bad to breaking bones.. Saul Goodman grew old
cause i know a guy who knows a guy
Jimmy wants to be a nobodypunk xD https://youtu.be/w8zQx_70t8M Spikehair tutorial  I want to see the film 🤟🏼☠🤟🏼👤NOBODY   NOBODY   NOBODY
another i was a spy movie, least it would entertain me when bored
*Randomly meets up*  John Wick: On business?  Hutch Mansell: Personal. You?  John Wick: Personal, my car and my dog. You?  Hutch Mansell: kitty cat bracelet.  John Wick : Understandable, have a nice day.   HEY!!!        Robert McCall(The Equalizer): you dropped this.
this movie has that factor
"If gang is about to attack on you in subway" "If FBI raid to kill you in your home" Best thing to do is:  "BETTER CALL SAUL"
Saul is a good actor but I really don't believe him as an action star. He moves way too sloppy.
Imagine if he is gonna show up in john wick that be cool
Better Call Saul Goodman...
It's all Goodman!
Plot twist : He is Saul Goodman
Ohh..the sound track is awesome
He is just a John Wick with family
I guess its time to better call saul
He was also a lawyer before 😆
Better call Sall....
imagine if this movie was saul goodman's life after breaking bad
The film is also produced by Tobey Maguire...wow.
2:38 triple headshot
ohh shitttt
I love the shot of the hand gun at 2:40
Why in Feb ,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Exactly I remembered #Jhonwick movie scenes.. Lots of Guns & Guts.. 🔥🔥🔥
I hope they turn nobody and john wick into series like alien vs predator.
NOBODY NOBODY  Does it better!!!
In the end pinkman and saul are going to meet.
*Mitski entered the chat*

I'm gonna love this movie I feel,
Rip off

Comedic John Wick, can't wait.
Hmmm,,   errbody say 'john wicx" 😕😕😕😕😕😕😕
On my birthday 🎂 (26 February) this movie is coming 🤩🤩.Wow 😄❤.
Better call Saul because he's breaking bad
So John Wick had a cousin and they left together 😑
John Wick's Parody?

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO 8 BILLION INCLUDING YOU.  IF YOU SEE, THIS VISIT THIS CHANNEL FOR YOUR FAVORITE.
2:37 ooooh baby a triple
This f%cking no body is the babayaga
Like Jason Bourne made it to his retirement. Action scenes look great however it might be not as entertaining as this trailer. Russian guy directs.
Fuck yeah
Nobody: Literally Nobody Also Nobody: Making a movie on a meme template.
Never Underestimate a Power of a Common Man.
Basically John wick with a family.
Better call the Auditor....
“In theaters only. February 2021”.  Ha! Good luck with that.
1:13 aalu lele beta, kela lele beta.
have to watch it.
I am the one who knocks.
Finally YouTube recommends has somthing worthy and not 4 years old
For 12 years ⚡
its just another john wick..
Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet 😁😁😁
Why always British accents with the Bad guys.. so overdone.
Vampiro Harry vampira Meghan put ask España Elizabeth Diana cojida  cómo su video y si resvista
It's all good man !!!
Moral: Always ask nobodies if they were a gang member before🙄😂
It's John Wick, But  In a God Damn Explicit Mode
John Wick but they attack his family instead of killing his dog
This is gonna be Bad.
DON'T WATCH THIS TRAILER IF U DONT WANT IT SPOILED.. Almost the entire movie is in this trailer..
This looks awesome! Good to see Saul getting some bigger roles. Definitely will watch this when it's out.
seems like john wick but idc this looks awesome
If here Liam neeson the movie is next level mass hit😎👊
How many times are they going to make this movie?
Me: I want john wick Mom : We have john wick at home   John wick at home :
So its John wick 2.0?
2021 gonna have some good films
I love Bob Odenkirk but like...is this a joke? This just seems like a parody. He's just got this closet with a buncha cool-looking black guns and a nice, clean, white surface with lighting like in a jewelry store, and he's a former sketchy badass secret agent or assassin or whatever who can just casually defeat six armed men decades younger than himself with no weapons? Come on. We've seen this silly middle-aged white guy fantasy so many times before. We're still doing John Wick movies. Come on, guys.
Nobody does it better 😂
This 3 minute trailer moves quicker than better call sauls' seasons as of late...
Here's SAUL GOODMAN🔥🔥🔥
This looks like a dope thriller! Bob Odenkirk looks like he is having a blast with this role
John wick: "Mansell." Hutch Mansell: "John." John wick: Hutch Mansell: John Wick: "you working?" Hutch Mansel: "yeah, they killed my daughter's kitty bracelet." John Wick: "hmm." Hutch Mansell: John Wick: Hutch Mansel: "John" John Wick: "Mansell."
I like papaya
This looks awesome!
John Wick, RED, Joker, Death Wish, Die Hard.  What a combo
You know how it is ..you better Call Saul 🤷🏻‍♂️
looks good lol
Please be in the JWCU!! (John Wick Cinematic Universe)!
I thought for a second that was Rick Grimes in the thumbnail.
finally have one movie after this shit year.
He looks like every Middle age white I've ever met.
Another john wick 😞
I was secretly hoping we would see some other breaking bad cameos in this. But it’s looks great.
Не звоните в полицию, лучше звоните Солу
It doesn't make sense since he was so famous for better call saul
fitnesscrocodiles com rushblues com godeal365 com kudosmen com hotteenlive com bestbabypoint com laasiangirl
Holyyy. Trust me this is the only action movie I've gotten excited about in a longggg time.
Liam Neeson: There's always a bigger fish.  Cue Duel of fates
Lol wft 😂😂😂😂😂 very unbelievable character
1:33 nice..
That's no what I mean when I said better call Saul.....
That moment when "You should see the other guy" is actually something he said in Breaking Bad in the same circumstances
Well they really left nothing to your imagination in this trailer.
Nobody watch this trailer again and wait until the movie comes out. lets all go in fresh. wait one person watch a million more times. take one for the team
When did Saul learn how to fight
"I worked for some very dangerous people"  Gustavo Fring: Yes, yes he did.
Okay now i was sold at "give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet"
Saul's not playing around this time
Looks like John Wick's Equalizer but with Marvel quips thrown in.
Nobody can do anybody cry
Nobody: In theaters only February 26th Covid-19: I will end this man's career.
Be honest, nothing would be cooler then a cross over between this and John wick
0:27 on his drink it says WM. Possible refrence to wexler - mcgill?
Cool, we can see that there's some influence from Wick
Better call Saul ❤️
Better kill them all
What is this? Better call john wick?
Better call Saul 🤣👍
2:37 OOOO BABY A TRIPLE! OH WOW!
It's All GOOD MAN
The guy who edited this trailer matched up the rhythm and video perfectly. It's so good.
Jeez, calm down Saul..
Saul dando caña jjjj
A movie who seems a dream including jhon wick !  what a lose fragment!
It's all good man
1:02 Daniel Bernhardt ?
The greatest John wick parody. Wow.
I love movies like this but the casting of............well I'll give it a chance.  Looks pretty promising.
No me gusto, este actor no es para este tipo de peliculas.
Another john wick
hay call come up and take metamfetmain
And there it is. The birth of a brand new meme !
damn seeing this actor i expected a tv series. no binge watching for me...
Saul Wick
I am more interested in the guy frantically yelling Nobody in the trailer
I need this mindless epic action in my life. And it looks like it could actually work pretty well too .
Does anyone know the name of the song? Or can link me to it?
Who will be not wear mask in 2021? NOBODY...
Wait, I know this guy. Hmm. 1 min after imdb. OMG!!
John wick kills for dog, nobody kills for cat...
the joke is in the end: Theathers only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqSTxideuHk&ab_channel=AkshatDalvar
Why didn't Walt use this guy more often? Damn!
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have any money.. but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you return the "kitty cat bracelet" now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you...and I will kill you.
Better call Saul meets Equalizer meets John Wick. Gold!!
Buggie huggieee
I wish he was married to Kimberly Wexler in this one.
This breaking bad spin off looks amazing tbh
Nice
Walter White is the Danger John Wick is the Boogeyman and Saul Goodman?     hes nobody.
Another action like johhn wick
Reminds me of my dad
Poorly done fighting scenes and some over the top secret agent storyline turned me off. Saul should have stayed in the legal business.
I feel quite bored of these male wet violence fantasy movies.. Not that I was ever really a fan to begin with...  Then again.. Ilya Naishuller is a badass.. So I'll keep an open mind.
Saul Goodman after changing his identity for the second time
When Saul Goodman decided to become Heisenberg movie
Sips is a badass
so... john wick
Better call nobody
He's the one who trained John Wick
this looks fucking boring. so many movies are the same. no originality these days.
Damn What track is that at 1:12 😳 , also superb work by the editor, mad sound design .💕 Waiting for this
Nobody: Literally nobody: Nobody:
Is this a sequel to the graveyard book?
Somebody
Better call nobody
It’s All good man
شكله تحفه لان الممثل فخم
The trailer's awesome but it's the undeniable fact that we already have John Wick, instead of dog getting killed it's now saving the family
Fuck does this look good
Is this the ideal father ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Granted we are allowed to go to the movies
Great Movie can't wait to see the trailer!
Looks like some wholesome family entertainment ;-)
Dude, senator tankerbell gots huevos!

Thanks for showing all the movie in the trailer again Hollywood
Better call somebody

It's another story of Jimmy... breaking bad part 2
lol ok old man, you're really playing a impossible role
Better Call Saul
daaamn saul realy changed since prison break
Cool Trailer but I'm afraid it spoiled the whole movie. Still not gonna miss this one though.
Is this John Wick's dad?
Imagine getting asked who were you interviewing and you have to reply "nobody" when your officer can see the guy behind you
Wow
John wick with a family looks super dopamine
"Give me the GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!"
00:40 Why is no one is talking about mike....😞
In the end, the cat be like  ""Nobody" cares about me, also nobody mind me !!"
People are missed about men's movie, waiting forward
john wick vibes  😀
john wick the wish version
Better call soul
This movie is gonna be a hit!! Trust me!
Better call nobody
The least believable part of this movie is that 3 white guys got onto a bus and started harassing people.
Better call Saul Goodman and find out who's nobody!
Saul goodman
I only see him as a lawyer😉😂
Whoa, Saul Goodman, keep calm!
I guess Saul couldn’t stay out of trouble.
I have a tendency to punch on the wall whenever I get very very angry.... The similarity was really satisfying 😄😄
Saul Goodman..👍
Looks too fake
damn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This look nice
This is definitely a different role for this actor.
C'mon, I am the only one who found this trailer a little cringy? :O
From Better call saul to better run away from him.
Isn't this just The Equaliser?
While we were waiting for BCS season 6 ... you were creating this kind of fucking movie ??
He worked for some very dangerous people mmmmmm breaking bad
This is when he was still slippin Jimmy
All jokes aside this looks pretty good
1:12 Can anyone give the link to this song
Ll
solution
Hello police  nobody punched somebody in front of everybody
Saul Goodman in John Wick mode.
This is a must see.
Let's go saul !!!
Saul Goodman looks a bit different here...
Alexey Seryebryakov as a bad guy? No, thanks!)
sold! would totally watch this
John Wick: I understand
So, the guy who made John Wick, then made the same movie two more times, now makes that movie again with a different actor? How original.
So this is Long Kiss Goodnight except Geena davis character is dating John Wick and Saul is her ex.😁
Still not sure if this is a John Wick parody or a serious film...
Boy liberal Hollywood sure does love to glorify guns and violence.
Another John wick
SAL Goodman - is now killer ?  buhahhahaah
Damn, Saul finally grew some balls!
who's excited for Nobody: Chapter 2 and Nobody: Chapter 3 - Parabellum?
I just hope it's in the same universe as John Wick. That way we can have a face off between them in the finale.
So... This is jhon wick's attorney?
Kim, don’t come to HHM tomorrow
Now this is badass
Wow 3 triple headshot
Nobody Rambo
Çakma John wick

This is like John Wick but it's actually Saul
Does anyone sense some John Wick vibes? Could've been cool if this the backstory of Boogeyman or whatever connects to John Wick Continental universe
What is saul goodman doing here
Milking all John Wick vibez
at least its not netflix
whoolala
Why is Hollywood a liberal place, yet the biggest promoter of violence, revenge and guns?
Mr. Show went real dark
Id rather he did more of bcs
This trailer is way too descriptive ...should have ended it after that bus fight. Now i don't even care to see the movie.
Nobody 2: Somebody Nobody 3: Everybody  I can already picture it
The man that acted taken would have been better
"Nobody is John Wick."
Nobody:  Nobody: I'm Nobody
Bob in badass role and kicking asses!! Never thought about it. Seems he rocked it once again :)
He reminded me of someone who once said, " I am not in danger, I am the DANGER."
Damn, he better call saul
Паль клевый, с этим русским акцентом.
awesome
this looks so bad, I can't wait to see it
Plot Twist: This is John Wick’s dad.
errrr are they remastering john wick?? also same universe???? seriously wheres the game adaptation?
This trailer went from Joker to John Wick real quick
Well you know what you gotta do?  You Better Call Saul! XD
this is john wick if his wife didnt die... uhmm
0:55 Александр Паль?
I am sorry but this looks like a parody of John wick
I trust *Nimo Nobody*
What's Sal upto?
Wow its cool
Es buenísimo ese actor
I thought this was Better Call Saul movie
Now I am confused: are theaters still a thing?
Or Arya
Music is so interesting and funny 😁
They stole his daughter's kiddy kat bracelet....XD
Finally -- the first movie trailer I have seen in over a year that I am actually excited and want to see!!!!
I don't believe in it.
Better NOT Call Saul
Sul
John wick: a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary
Who the f are you. Nobody - " Fkkin nobody."
So... This must be John Wick's father.
so this is what Saul Goodman has been doing
He's still Saul Goodman for me 😅
Who? That fucking nobody?
I just wish all these effects and mambo jambos were there back in good old days.
Damn Saul ok
Saul, what the hell?
Like John wick
Saul broke bad !
Nobody can replace Keanu Reeves
Yo it’s Saul goodman and Walter Steele
This guy is freaking awesome dude
Huuu
Better call saul x John wick
So here is saul goodmen after better caul saul.
I typed nothing.
The fight scene in the bus was stupid
Is this saul goodman's 3rd identity
Who will waiting this movie Hit like button
Am I the only one that thinks this guy looks and sounds Bruce Willis?
Saul Goodman was James McGill. Before that he was NOBODY
John wick dad edition
Вау, не ожидал увидеть Паля в американском фильме. Рад за него, удачи, Саня!
So I see they got sick of John wick decided to make an older version of him.
Better call wick
better call John Wick
"that fucking nobody is Jhon faking Wick"
Trying to slurp coffee like him
Nobody:  The Movie: Nobody
Is he gonna look like this in season 6? hard to imagine..
Finally Something like John Wick💯🔥🔥
Damnnnn
Boring, unoriginal, cheap
Great actor but plot is cliche crap.
Finally an R rated movie
A history of violence but it really is John Wick
This is what you call a trailer 🤩
I'm nobody😈
Slippin Jimmy THE MOVIE.
That's what happens when you say better not call Saul
Better call Saul
Seems pretty meh...
It's all good man.....❤️❤️❤️
Too bad they discovered this gem of an actor at his late 50's 💔.
Bob odenkirk an action hero... now seen everything
better than saul at least
You got me sold at “from the producers of John Wick”
Would be really cool if they somehow tie this up with the john wick universe and make Bob's character John Wick's hitman friend or something.
so basically this is an alternate version of john wick if his wife never died...
The perfect macho dream movie: All my problems are going alway if I punch it hard enough. I wish... Maybe?
Nobody:     Nobody official trailer: I'm nobody
Chuck norris 2
I was waiting for Saul Wick
So Jimmie on steroids 🤔
The Family Man meets John Wick!
I am ready 🔥🔥🔥
It SAUL good man
I refuse to believe that they just copy pasted John Wicks plot without it being set in the same universe?!? That's just lazy.
WOW
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
I thought it is a parody, but damn it is on fire.
Why did they hire arabs to do the soundtrack ?
1:15 Oh god🔥🔥
I m Jimmy McGill yo
*I'm a simple man. I see Bob Odenkirk, I click.*
so a parallel universe where john wick gets to have a family.. and then they took his daughter's kitty cat bracelet..
ITS ALL GOOD MAN 😉
So this is John Wick but his wife didn't die and he started a family. At least that's a happy ending
"He once killed 3 people in a bar with an eraser, with a freakin eraser!"
What's up with the background music though 🤣
John wick vibes....
Boring trailer....
Based on a true story.
Who els has a big smile saying yes!
people don’t know how danger 2021 for us💀💀
Bob can play anybody
MANOJ
Manoj
John Pick
Saul Badman
I thought it is parody to Jonh Wick
Manoj
AMAZING THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN ONE UNIVERSE WITH JOHN WICK AND MANY MORE WILL COME ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mixture of Family man and Jhon Wick
What the hell was that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Started of interesting. Then went down hill from there.
Nobody does it better .
Saul is the best
first minute good but then? Another sci fi peace of s.. like John Wick
John wick Parody?  Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
John wick: revenge kills  Saul: where’s the damn KITTY CAT BRACELET Someone already did this damn
3 douchebags and a depressed guy  in a public transport. There's only one possibility
Is this John wick's brother?? I didn't know that.
Don't call 911 BETTER CALL SAUL 😉😜
Even though we like the cast, i think we can all agree that this movie will get a B or B+ for its score with Chris Stuckmann etc
I thought the BGM to be Indian😂
He better call Saul
This movie should be named Saul goodman back in street...
Better call Saul
Came here for the breaking bad/Better call Saul comments
Where's Jesse pinkman and walter white??  they only can make him get scared to the death .. amigo del cartel
He's a bit overqualified to be a lawyer
Something tells me he’s gonna join John wick universe at some point in the future...even the poster similar to John wick.
John Wick - Puppy Nobody - Kitty Someguy - Birb
Серебряков? Паль? что происходит? а....Найшуллер.всё понятно)
Excited like EVERYBODY !!
Another fast & Furious movie after hobbs & Shaw, "Nobody"
That nobody was john wick
You don’t mess with a man’s kitty cat bracelet.
Cousin Johnny Wake
This is fucking literally John wick if his wife hadn't died n  had a family
I can't wait💣💣💣💣💥💥💥💥
He'd better call saul before starting the war...
Since I was young my dream has been working with Universal picture and make mad movies with them,one day I Will.
Hollywood is back finally. All tht feminist crap was ruining movies. Glad to see Saul kick some ass lol.
So if John Wick had a family??
This looks absolutely ridiculous. I'm in
So basically john wick with family?!
everyone saying this being in the john wick universe would be a big plot twist      But what if this was actually Saul Goodman?
You better NOT call Saul
Trailer contain all action and dialogue in movie, this trailer literally waching the whole movie
best fukin lawyer
BMF!!!!
Sauuuul
So... John Wick?
🔥🔥🔥
No body: No body’s thumbnail: 🤜🏾😕🤛🏾
Saul Wick.
Family version of john wick is here👨‍👩‍👦
Nobody: ‘Call an Ambulance! Call an Ambulance! ....But not for me’ 😂
Hmmm, Home Alone: Joker becomes John Wick
This is something i wished to see for a long2 time
ayy saul goodman
ilk başta john wick parodisi zanettim mk
"It's not what you did son that angers me so, it's who you did it to" "Who? that fking nobody?" "that fkin' nobody... is Nobody"
Better...not call Saul
I liked Saul more tbh
I think that NOBODY can wait the february 26
someone tell me the name of the song please
This should be legal. You don't beat your wife and kids. You are frustrated, you out beat some punk ass criminals simple, should be legal.
Never underestimate Soul Goodman 🔥🔥
Better Kill, Saul
Call sol
Is like The opposite of john wick, with a living wife and kids...Cant wait to watch it🤭😁
In theaters only - sure budy
* John Wick has sent you a friend request *
From a lawyer to auditor?
Mr.nobody😶
So it's from the producer of John Wick and involves some secret assassin like organisations? Is this set in the same universe? Is this the start of the WCU?
Is this going to be same mr. nobody from great and furious cause this and that are both from darker studio..........😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He is soul man
All this actions is fake!
The f*ucking nobody is Papa Wick
So he is John Wick's long-lost brother
So John wick fights over his dog's death and now, this guy fights over a kitty cat bracelet   Understandably understandble , have a great day
See, you quit Goliath National Bank, and you become nobody ...
It’s all good man😃😃😃🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
If one day, someone  decides to make a movie about sam Fisher, that is the face i wanna see
Mr. Nobody Fast Furious ??
I can see John Wick in him.
John Wick but casual.....
"I worked for some very dangerous people"    Walter white: Yes he did
unbrakeable vibe
Better call wick looks sick.
So there is a Movie about me, interesting.
Went from tacky lawyer too john wick real quick
I hope this is in the same universe as John Wick...
We have a new John Wick and I am glad it's saul goodman. It's all good man
wow, first part was death wish charles bronson. second part was John Wick. Third part was a 1990s movie.
name of the track
Looks cliche as hell but a good time nonetheless
Nobody Literally nobody   Universal pictures: NOBODY
Looks CRAPIER than john "weak". Both GARBAGE, anyway
he is maybe john wick dad
I'm interested
Looks like Rick Grimes in the thumbnail
I hate when trailers reveal almost everything about the plot of the movie

BASICALLY John Wick 10 years LATER
Older and Uglier version of John Wick but I am gonna watch.
Nobody Nobody  Nobody does it better !!  Only legends will understand this reference
That f**king NOBODY was John Wick.
Wahhh something interesting ❤️
don't call 911 but you better call Saul
Серебряков? или померещилось?
He is almost the one who knocks
This looks fucking dreadful
another movie to make dads feel badass again.
He protecc He attac But most importantly.... He want the bracelet of Kitty Cat!
John wick lite
Saul: Say my name? Random people: You are nobody. Saul: You are god damn right.
This looks cool but it’s such a John wick rip off it’s kinda cringe 😬
for some reason saying i feel like  nobody has taking on a hole new meaning  👊
this movie reminds me of John W. 😎
So john wick gets old
Hollywood will never make an original film ever again will it?
Fantastic🤘😝🤘
Fuckin awesome 👏
Man, Universal! You could make it a bit better. Just a f bit. Why is always you f such good initiation up?
We're about to see loads of videos of Bob at Taran Tactical 😂
so i guess it's either some sort of parody or just another boring BS about some dude having "a unique set of skills"...
The whole movie is literally spoiled in the trailer...
Better call WICK
Oh Saul, what are you like
You look like shit dad.  "You should see the other guys.."  Savage 100!
have you seen the boy in this trailer, later he has been known as John Wick - you guys might never think that John wick's dad was innocent right?
Why did it take me so long to realize the poster is just a copy of the John Wick poster but with fists
Saul is looking rip af
Saul Badman
Is this in the same John wick universe ???
John Wick's  Cousin 😂😂this looks awesome.
Nobody: official trailer Me: cool
Should've put this in JW world to make it John Wick Cinematic Universe.
It’ssss aall murder man
I can't wait to see this!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope this is apart of the John Wick universe.
Now I know why BCS S6 is late. But it's ok
My God yes
When you order John Wick movie from Aliexpress:  Nobody:
If you are 30 plus and stupid enough to watch a marvel kinda action movie. THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.
So a suburban dad john wick
this is john wicks's papa
looks fun, i dont say that often about movies lol
From the producer of John Wick, comes John Wick with a suburban family
Odenkirk is a goat but this looks terrible
I thought Mike was dangerous.
This has a lot of John Wick references,and ofc other movies too
I feel like no matters what Bob Odenkirk does, he will always be Saul Goodman. I can't stop seeing him instead of the actual main character.
Seems Lit
I mean cool stuff, cool movie, but these midlifecrisis empowerment movies are getting out of hand :D
Meanwhile John wick : .....?
Dont call 911, better call Saul
this a spin off of John wick?
Seems like the entire movie is in this trailer.
such a great movie
Awesome making 🙏👍
"in theaters Nov 26" - theme song predicts viewership "nobody!  Nobody! "
So... another John Wick plot basically?
Not gonna lie, this looks like cringe.
That's good man
Feels so Bollywood.
Wow
Saul Wick?????
reminds me of when charles manson was asked who he is and he said nobody
I cant take Saul Goodman serious. Lmai.
Nobody Nobody Does It Better 😋😎
You just showed us most of the movie.. you fucks!
So Saul Goodman is breaking bad here.
Started off looking good, then it just got ridiculous. Loved John wick but it was too over the top I couldn’t bear it
Can't wait to see it
Irgendwie kaufe ich dem Schauspieler die Rolle nicht ab. Der Ansatz der Story ist gut, aber das hat man alles schonmal in anderen Filmen gesehen, es wirkt wie zusammengebastelt und erinnert mich an die Zombies von der Thrillerbark von Gecko Moria, aneinander genähte Fetzen.
Saul Goodman
So good to see more of Bob Odenkirk, he’s an incredible actor and this shows his sheer diversity
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥
So... John Wick 4 with different actor 🤔
Don't call 911, better call saul
Soooo if John Wick had a family this would be it
Well i saw ermanthraut in threre
WOoooOooooowww
0:28 the tumbler he’s holding says WM which is *“wexler-mcgill”*
Saul has learned some serious stunts from Mike
after watching this trailer, i realized that walterwhite is lucky saul didnt fightback
1:32 "don't call 911" "Better call Saul"
Plot twist: He is the father of John Wick. last scence would be an entrance of John wick where nobody die
I thot is that Saul
Breaking Bad ( Saul Edition )
this looks pretty good nice to see him do something more edgy with action  character wise looks bad ass
Call saul
Me: Knock knock anyone there? Life: Nobody
I swear to god, i was saying last day. Why Saul Goodman has no big movies like this. And today i saw this. I am very excited.
Looks like the John wick universe
Now u can say nobody does it better 😂
Nobody :  Nobody
I do love seeing good ol' Bob doing an action flick
A History Of Violence
When jhon wick demands money  nd u dont hve tht much budget fr film  So
In better call saul, lalo actually calls saul nobody.
Is it me or the trailer is showing too much of the movie?
Продолжения Джона Уика лучше сделайте, а не эту жалкую пародию.
Better watch better call Saul
Didn't knew saul goodman is 3rd cousin to john wick
I saw those sexy Swiss 553 rifles.
*YOU DON"T FUCKING DO THAT*
This is actually Saul Goodmans next fake id
He is the lawyer of the one who knocks!
Better NOT call Saul! 😱
it's all good man
Awesome
So, John Wick but with another actor. Got it.
What a fricking copy cat🤦‍♂️
Now this is the kind of a lawyers I wanna hire
Now This Called  Better Call Saul
James candle string
oh is this the american version of jason statham ?
Who are you? I'm Saul Goodman from Better Call Saul 😆
Love it was waiting for action movie like tis after jw3 ..
John wick’s not available on the line, Hey, better call Saul.
Please let it be a part of John Wick universe
Saul Goodman is going Rage Mode
Nice!
Lol @ 1:12 to 1:16 🤣😂🤣😂
This guy is going to need a good lawyer
John wick + Walter white + soul Goodman = "Nobody"
So they found another bruce willis
Better be in theaters only. Please don't be on any of that streaming bs
This is a comedy right? Saul as an action hero? 🤦
Long time best movie coming
This is what really happened when Mr Chips became Scarface
john wick lite !
He is Saul
I see a lot of articles saying this is related to john wick. If so then thats pretty cool
2:56 ooof..
John Wick teams up with Nobody
Don't call 911 , am gonna fuck them up .
Remind me of John wick ... awesome fights
From a Lawyer to to gunman! Wow what a change!
Wtf is this, John wicks gradpa, straight fkn garbage man
I don't know if anyone noticed, but the image for the trailer (the one you had to click to see this) is like a John Wick poster, but instead of guns pointing at Keanu, there are fists, rushing towards Bob.
The thumbnail reminds me of john wick
Saul Badman!
He looks like every middle age white guy.
Nah garbage
Better Not Insult Saul
Looks like 'family' + 'john wick' combination
Me afer seeing this: "Better call Saul"
So American, think I'm American out for now.  I remember the critics asked if we needed more of these types of films when Equalizer 2 came out, yet here we go again. No thanks I'll stick to my Spanish films on Netflix, now back to the professor..Money Heist!
What's that song?
First i taught it was a cartoon but when he start running and never saw it as cartoon again...
bob has reached a level of fame that this movie is gonna do good just because he is in it i cant wait for it
This happens when Saul breaks bad.....
Viggo : It's not what you did son, it's who you did it to Viggo's son : Who ?? That Fucking Mr. Nobody ?? Viggo : THAT FUCKING NOBODY IS "Nobody"
Looks NICEEEEEEEEEEE.
I would like to like to study comments personally
Saul goodman doing the dirty work himself.
You were an auditor? I thought you were a lawyer?
Good man
Better call Saul
I didn't realise I needed this but I NEED THIS
Cheap john wick
When did it come out or when does it?
It looks like someone better call saul
Amazing
this looks fucking awesome
Can anyone say the song name at 1:12 sec in the fight
Fuck i wish this was a tv series.
John wick + Walter White
Filme title : NOBODY My Eye see: NOOBDY!!
goddamn, bob broke bad
Better Call 911
Saul tried to hide but his old life caught up with him
"No, it's not all good man."
Please tell me this in the John Wick Universe.
This prequel is after cinabon when he started a new life
Now this, I like, I like this very much
John Wick rip off
"That f***g nobody is NOBODY"
2:44 is Copied from Indian Cinema's Style. 😂
Lawyering didn't work out huh
He isn't nobody He's damn Saul Goodman
Jesus christ this could be shown as another breaking bad movie
Fast and furious nobody...
I like that.
Me like it very much.
Mike did a good job training Saul. 🙏💯🙏
Nobody,    Nobody,    Nobody does it better.......
Damn you better call Saul
He's the best lawyer
better call saul references > john wick references
Saul goodman the movie
Hater nobody .. ❌ ... Comments allbody ....⚡
Better call Saul
Waiting for movie broda .. mad mission ... By nobody 😜😜
Damn Saul - didnt know you had this guy in you 👊
What happens if John Wick and Nobody team up does the world just implode ?
In theaters only and at YTS also
Wow., cant wait watch this movie.
Saul goodman
We need John Wick vs Nobody
John wick copy
NOBODY, does it better💋
Let's better call Saul...
I can't wait until suburban dads watch this and think they're secretly mafia assassins lol
Why did they make a remake of John wick 3?
The moment Saul became Heisenberg
bruh i mean just give him the damn bracelet
"Gimme the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!"
"Gimme the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!"
If he were young, I'd rather see Skindred's Nobody on this trailer
This makes me both hyped for the movie and the last season of Better Call Saul. LET'S GOOO!
John Wicks lost brother. Ok got it 😊
OH NO GOD! PLEASE NO! FIRST THERE WAS A DOG AND NOW A CAT??? What is it going to be next huh? A fish?????
This one of those movies where the story is average so instead the movie uses flashy kills and combat...I think imma pass
I see Saul had enough
After all this time, finally, Saul can fight back. But not as Slippy Jimmy. Watch out, guys!
0:40 Dr Brown :D!!
2:37    ohhhh baby a triple!
Saul has really changed since getting away from Heisenberg.
John wick: "finally a worthy opponent"
nobody and john wick teamup pls
Goosebumpsss....
*Bob Odenkirk is very underrated.*
John Wick, is that you?
2:44 so he's Charles Manson?
It looks like Saul Goodman had some lessons with Mike Ehrmantraut
Everything about this Trailer reminds me of John Wick. 🤔
Better call john wickman
I am soooo hyped to see this.  I can't wait for this to come out.  Looks like it will be pretty good.  I love seeing Bob in more non comedy roles.  I mean I love seeing him in his comedy roles but it is nice to see his range as an actor and he is pretty good.
Welp, hope he knows a good lawyer
is that Arthur from HIMYM?
True Lies 2
"dont call 911"  its Better Call Saul
If John Wick had successfully gotten into a normal life... ...Just to be brought back from retirement... and he's pissed
Wow
Saul goodman rampage mode
Beats most action movie trailers by far.. and the bgm is damn....😎
What do you call Bob Odenkirk attacking someone?     As-Saul-t.
South Hollywood ka picture lagra hai😆
saul goodman finally decided to start a family
So basically this is a family friendly John Wick movie
https://youtu.be/iSG3E3x6cfk
Can anyone please name that arabic song played during 1.12 ?
WTF its like my dream.  Every day I use to have dream like this
mr peabody ??
This flick looks boss af.
"Don't call 911" yeah I'm sure they won't have to after your neighbors call them after getting a whole mag of bullets through their walls😂
Moral value: DO NOT GET IN TROUBLE WITH CALM DADS!
yeah i feel like people trying to imitate john wick now i would probably believe it more if nobody didn't look older than john wick.
What an original story. Can’t wait to not see this.
We got another Jhon Wick
John wick spinnoff
that lawyer got skills
So many modern day Steven Seagals makes u wanna watch his old movies huh 🤣🤣💪💪
This picks up after Saul gets out of the cab, should have called it "Life post-Cinnabon"
It's all good man
Ohh thats why it had such a john wick vibes
Nobody is a John wick cousin
Imagine if this is in the same universe as John wick and they meet up
That fucking no body is John Wick
2:37  *_Oh baby, a triple!_*
Saul Wick
Nobody is played by Saul( Bob Odenkirk ).  Nobody is directed by Hardcore Henry .
Rambo meets Nobody
Finally some action movie!!
nobody:  nobody:
HE DEFECTED THROUGH A SUNROOF
I guess he needs somebody to love.
This looks like Bollywood movie.
The mug he drinks out of at 0:27 has a big "WM" logo on it...  Wexler and McGill reference from Better Call Saul? :)
It's one of those trailers that basically sums up the whole movie so you no longer need to watch it anymore.
Better call Saul!
bad John wick
Pls who knows the song used in the trailer?
He is my favourite " Breaking Bad" character. Why don't they introduce 'Lalo' in it😂 would be damn fun👍
He saw all the john wick movies thats for sure
The is what people want Nobody
oh yeah!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘😎🤜
is this john wicks dad or grand father?
Slipping Jimmy
I barely recognized my man Saul. Wow
I thought this was a game
I Love seeing him in this roll! Wow
wow 😮😱👌👍
What's with all these "dad goes on a murderous rampage against common criminals" baby-boomer savior/revenge fantasy movies lately
Хєрня
1:12 i Was Pump listing to that haleba haleba...
Better Call Saul + Joker + Jhon Wick
I...can't take this seriously. The choreography just looks so out of place. I thought it would be a guy magooing his way to becoming a tough guy. Not just being a tough guy looking like...Saul.
The amount of people trying to make jokes involving quotation marks is so silly and dumb.   This is directed by the same guys as John Wick and it looks like an extremely similar story. But these guys make these films to display dope action and I am so down, especially seeing Bob Odenkirk in this kind of role
Looks like hot garbage
Soul last season
It's John wick and bad guys don't want him to get retire. So he liy says , m gonna fuck you😂
Do not take the kitty cat bracelet! 😂
01:34 ''Dont call 911.. Call Saul!
It all started from a kitty at bracelet
cousin of johnwick
... too wannabe'ish.....
JOKER: "AM I A JOKE TO YOU"
Don’t call 911. Better call Saul!!
why does it feel like this is a john wick spin off movie
I don't know, Better call saul
Saul Goodman? Jimmy!?
So is this a parody of John Wick?
John wick is best
Shit seems hella corny and was made with a low budget and wack actors lol
How can something be so ridiculous and awesome at the same time?
idk trailer starts promising but turns into a basic action movie trailer
Better Call Nobody!
fragile masculinity, the movie
😢 good man 😻
"Who are you?" "Goodman. It's all Goodman."
I really love this kind of movie. holy....
Goddamn this movie 🎥 looking f**%g awesome !
Saul goodman being badass
Ah, so this is the future would have had if his wife didn't died
WoW
looks like saul finally broke bad
Who am I to say this looks awesome? I am just a NOBODY!
el hall en malcom y  teken jajajajaj
Is this Home Alone 2020?
Machete will get mad of this ripoff
For the people who think starting a comment with "plot twist" is original and funny:  You are idiots.
YES YOU GET THAT KITTY CAT BRACELET
Please.. no more spoilers or trailets. you had me at john wick writer and better caul saul actor... the only thing putting me off is, it was directed by Ilya Naishuller... the guy that did hardcore henry.... but i definitely give "nobody" a go....
The thumbnail is kind of a rip off of john wick’s except instead of guns its fists. Why
Imagine this guy and John Wick teaming up!
Damn, this looks cool. I already see me there.
That looks so fucking bad
this guy looks like Kevin Costner
Ham on Rye
Это что, Серебряков???????????????????????
2:40 Sneaking some triangles in there.
Saul Goodman *Alternatine Dimension* Saul Badman
Rofl, John Wick with a family, but no dog.
Amazballz
Это что Серебряков там свою жопу намылил....хе хе .....
Any breaking bad fans?I'm sure his face brought here before the video
i...am unsure.
This actually looks like it's going to be one hell of a good movie!
So a remake of "A History of Violence"?
they got Saul !!!! somebody call Mike  lol
Nobody? S’all good man...
Lalo Salamanca did say he was Nobody...
3 minute trailers should have their own place in hell
Its just the little things that set off the bomb.  Example: Like stealing a kitty cat bracelet.
Saul Goodman trained by John Wick
Right wing fantasy
Hollywood is so tryhard.
I love Odenkirk but to me this is just not a good fit, kinda weird seeing him as a badass when all I see him in is comedy and even in his dramas hes never the "tough guy". Just my personal opinion.
Better call Saul 2 Electric boogaloo
там РУсский актер снимается
I never realized, Bob Odenkirk is a perfect shoe in for Max Payne :o
Saul... Saul wick.
The pushy select constitutively race because adjustment intrestingly force from a common wilderness. aboard, nice cough
Is this a movie or series?
Agent: who the hell are you? Bob: I'm Saul Goodman
Nobody:
COOL!
😍
greatt movies
Huh saul yeah he used to work with very dangerous people named Walter and Jesse and an old man named mike   He used also to flirt with mike They even went on a vacation to the desert totally alone only god knews what they were doing
From director of "Hardcore Henry"
Didn't we just have a Joker origin story?
The story of John wicks Father
so many of these studios like using this mans face for their posters lmao
I feel really glad seeing actors put in the work like this to make action scenes feel more believable.
*Imagine, Post Credits Scene* reveals this is in the John Wick Universe.
Saul Wick: It's S'all bloody death and destructio.. Good, man.
Nobody:  Nobody: That's Me
Hey it's a talkative john wick
The Beginnings of a Jack West Jr cinema-verse?? One could only hope...
Saul Badman
mjjjjaaa.... it's been done to death before but whatever. gonna see it. there's nothing else to see during the pandemic.
After working 3 years in retail, I feel the same, pal.
Background music is superb.
Well I don’t have to go to the cinema, cause I just saw the whole movie
2:38 ooooooo baby a triple
I honestly only came for the stupid 'nobody' comments
For a sec i believe this Will be a film in the John Wick's universe
I see John wicks brother is here
Uhhhhbwhat?
So John Wick only with a family..
Don't call 911, t's all good man
Nobody:
1:00 is when he starts going badass
saul iam coming iam so hard best movie
Saul Wickman
Nobody should watch this movie
Looks like my kind of Friday night flick !
Saul is fucked up in this movie
They finally get him a descent role. It was about time.
I can't wait until this covid 19 virus dies and the first thing I gonna do is go to the movie theater and buy a ticket for this movie
John Wick family style
Этот ж Сашка Паль.
I already forsee a sequel. I can't wait😍😍😍
He can play Rorschach very well
That fucking nobody is john wick.
Nobody......asked for this
When the meme gets its own movie.
Just realized the irony of getting YouTube premium and watching this ad.
Kingsman reborn
Colin Salmon. I’m sold.
I though he was Mark Strong...
We missed Saul Goodman
This is like seeing your chill friend get drunk for the first time. I would have never thought I'd buy Bob Odenkirk in a John Wick style action movie.
huh
PRIDE
Give me the fukn kitty cat bracelet *Proceeds to spray his gun and throw a grenade*
Saul, is that u?
So not only is the plot similar to john wick, it has a similar cover art as well
I wouldn't bet on Bob Odenkirk being the next John Wick. But I like it.
Bye im buying tickets for this
0:41 I though It was mike 😐
Oh, shit. I was wondering when they were going to make Home Alone when the guy grows up.
Don't kill Mr. Wicks dog Don't take Nobody's kitty cat bracelet
Oh, so it's John Wick but with *COMEDY*
Saul wickman
John wick : they messed with my dog nobody: they messed with my cat
The trailer showed me the entire movie including plot twists and finale. Universal, you are a bunch of incompetent idiots.
I hate this trailers... they reveal almost the entire plot
The song ?
Mmmm John Wick?
*I\m gonna full support this because it's Jimmy*
It looks fun and exciting, I can't wait to watch it.
Sal’s going to need a good lawyer here
Thanks to this trailer, I don't have to watch the film now
Соул Гудман ебашится с Серебряковым)) это точно стоит посмотреть)))
Lol kinda looks like all the action scenes they couldnt shoot in the John Wick movies
WHAT ABOUT BETTER CALL SAUL!?
Its all good man
God damn Saul
Home Alone: Kevin's Grown up!
Who the fuck are u? Me, I'm Saul Goodman
is that kevin costner?
Free  money un just  watching vidéo xD Gagner de l'argent en regardent des vidéos quelle plaisirs <3 https://eybvideon.site/707699865568429/
I might have overcorrected. Lmao.
John Wick: family edition :)
Wick Goodman
We have john wick then what is the relevance of this movie from same producer.? John wick🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why does this remind me a bit of Michael from gta 5 story mode
Better call Saul 🤣🤣
The Revenge of the angry white male...
Сол Гудман меняет профессию
John Wick: It wasn't just a puppy...  Nobody: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!
"Dont call 911"  "Better call Saul!"
I think, that this man should better call Saul...
Oh yeah!!! I'm going to watch this movie.
beeter call saul
:29 wexler mcgill
Thanks for showing me the entire movie. What's the point of watching the movie, everything is already in the trailer.
good scuffed John Wick  Nice
Consider this......Pre Ordered.
Waiting for this one

Is this the Mr. Nobody from Fast & Furious ?
John wick kills with a pencil Nobody kills with a kitty cat bracelet
Best one
never underestimate nobody
JUST CALL SAUL
😎
Parece uma paródia de um milhão de clichês batidos
This Jordan Peterson redemption arc is wild.
Cringe af
Jimmy😍😍😍 all the Better Call Saul & Breaking bad lovers like here
In Theaters Feb 26... which Theaters? They are all closed!
looks good
Whoa
Seems like a movie that a regular corporate working dude daydreams about.
Soul this my man
I haven’t seen any comments about it literally being the joker scene but he beats them up instead of shooting
It's all good man
This is a film I've gotta see.
WOW Saul went insane! good for him...
Just looks like a PG13 version of History of violence....
Your honor my client was just trying to protect himself
I came here for Sal...
Why is this always about a puppy?
"in theaters only" ahh well so much for that
This is the moment where Jimmy became Saul Goodman
So they couldn’t come up with a way to further the John Wick storyline and decided to just restart it all.
Does it look like Taken to someone else too, or it is just me?
This is all part of the Wickaverse
in theaters? And here I was waiting to see in what stream platform it would go...
Better Call Saul
Plot twist: that's his actual name
Don't forget "He knows a guy who knows a guy".
I'm glad the fight scene in recent movies are no longer fast-cut-shaky-cam-Bourne-style anymore. Thank you John Wick and The Raid Redemption...!
-U look like shit... dad.  -U should see the other guys
Old JOHN WICK !
Holy shit, those punches !!
Don't call 911 but " Better call Saul "
American right winger wet dream 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saul Wickman
violence warning please..its just a f..ing trailer
What the hell is ALEKSANDR PAL doing here))
Proud Boy vs ANTIFA
john wick: in the suburbs
James “slippin” Nobody
This is the moment when Saul Goodman became Mike Ehrmantraut.
Reminds me of a Bruce Willis movie not long ago
John Wick
So this is why he sent Jesse pinkman to Iceland
0:46 JOKER flashbacks
Finally Saul goodman is fighting
That was really awesome🔥🔥😮
Anyone remembering John Wick
Better Call John Wick!
Сол даёт пизды Палю в автобусе? Надо будет глянуть.
He knows a guy who knows nobody
So basically if John wick didn't lose his wife
as a Mauritanian I'm very excited about this work hopefully Hollywood keeps it professional in this movie (if you catch my drift)
Saul GoodMan kinda dangerous
I can already see a John Wick and Nobody crossover coming.
Me: What is this s*it? The same only-action film with no story? Also me: *reads "from the producer of John Wick"* Still me: ok you got my attention
Walter and Jesse wanted beef with this guy?
Ok, for now you have my curiosity.
Better call Saul !
John wick in 40 years old ass nigga
“It’s all good man” Classic 👌🏾
Nobody:  Official Trailer: Nobody Nobody: Official Trailer: Also Official Trailer: Nobody.
Nobody:
For 12 years l been working for very dangerous people. Walter White, you are god dam right. 😎
So this is what happens when the quiet guy from your school has grown up.
This basically john wick if his wife would've died
WOW. DIDN'T KNOW JOHN WICK WAS TAUGHT BY HIS GRAND FATHER 🙂🙂🙂
Disclaimer: after breaking bad saul turns  into NOBODY
another shit
Yooo John called, he says he wants his cousin back
he said the title of the movie! Yoooo!
Saul wick
that's a nice S&W Model 60
so cliche, please dont waste our lawyer saul.
Badass Saul Goodman this time...
this guy vs john wick
Imagine if this is a shared universe with John Wick, and this Nobody ends up being  John Wicks mentor
Guys what is that song when he punched that asshole in bus ?
Сашка Паль и Боб Оденкирк в одном фильме? Я в раю?? Ахах Я сначала вообще не понял что происходит
Oh man it was amazing . He learned a thing or two from Hisenberg
Saul Goodman <3
Is this a reboot of a history of violence?????
DAD WICK
It's basically John Wick, kind of a more rough version.
Better don't f*ck with Saul!
So he's just slower John Wick?
Really excited about this 🖤
That 01:09 scene. Damnnnn😶
Saul Badman
Nobody Better Call Saul ... oh, wait. Saul's Nobody so it's Saul Goodman. Ok, great. Which begs the question, who stole the kit-kat bracelet?!
Moral of the story: don't be going around stealing people's kitty cat bracelets
my eyes man
This is Saul Goodman in Eva's world
Habada hibity john wick my enemy
What song plays when he punches the guys in the bus???
Мне показалось или там Серебряков
Plot twist: This movie will be better than TENET.
cant faking wait!!
I guess you could say Saul Goodman broke bad.
John Wick parody by the actual makers of John Wick ? Coool.
Look like Saul is finally "Breaking Bad"!!!
Better call Saul returns!
Yes please
wondering if John's makin' a cameo in here...ngl, that'd be awesome
now i saw whole movie.
So john became John Wick after Nobody died, alles klar, I understand it now.
sooo is a john wick but with family?
Soul Wikman
This is John wicks father
This is good thing BUT! Mr.Wick is Mr.Wick We thinking that Mr. Wick will come 😭😭
Why is nobody talking about "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET!"
"In Theaters Only February 26" Haha, yeah right !
oh GREAT another assassin hell bent on revenge over death of a cute animal cliche. /s
john wick knockoff??!!
That fucking Nobody.. was John Wick
Saul Badman
I like how with this trailer I know half the movie yet I haven't seen it. This is not a trailer.. this is a massive spoiler alert
So he's the guy who kills people with an eraser, a fucking eraser.
we can call him Saul badman from now😂
Now he’s not a Saul goodman anymore!😂
He’s still Saul goodman for me!🔥
"Nobody!... Nobody!... There's Nobody!... Nobody!". Yes, I came here for the soundtrack. ☺️
Did they killed his cat?
2:37 Sniper: eh, now thats nice
So. Much. Cringe.
Better call nobody
Awesome. This like John Wick Family Pack
I want this movie right now
Nope, there's more than enough of those kinda movies already. Wtf is that music in the trailer btw
never seen a trailer spoil this much of a movie.
he is better  for "Better call saul" 😂😂👍👍
Is anybody genuinely excited for this... I mean it just looks like every 'bad guy vs good guy Hollywood movie' that's been coming out the past 20 years
This is John Wick Part 4 containing story of John's Father.
They should have made it an ordinary Joe becomes extraordinary instead of ordinary Joe was a lie.
in theaters only, well you have to think positivelly :)
when you order John Wick from Wish
That fight scene made me like it
Sooo it's John Wick with a family and a cat.... 🤔
I miss the Max Payne videogames...
Man trailer just burned the whole thing I  feel like i watched it already..
это че, Серебряков?
I know him only by. Saul Goodman 😎🤓
i want this song. please
"12 years i've worked for very dangerous ppl" fans be like we know😂
''I'm Chuck Norris part 2''
NOW THIS ...... 👀🍿🎥🔥
This is every man's dream.
John Wick Sr
John wick turned into bond.
Nop.
"In theatres only"... Let's see how well this ages.
So....John Wick + Taken = This movie
One like for Saul Goodman
What is with the same train scene from the joker movie huh.... Explain ?
New john wish movie look good
Looks like John Wick directed this movie 🤣🤣
So it's like in an alternate universe if John wick had a family and would be old
I clicked on the video for Bob Odenkirk i liked the video for Bob Odenkirk I subscribed to the channel for Bob Odenkirk I will watch the movie for Bob Odenkirk I am leaving this comment for Bob Odenkirk
This is the moment James mcgill became saul goodman
John Wick lite lol
Soul Goodman breaking Bad History Of Violence 2 John Wick Suburbs
so here it goes ... we are going to see John wick and Mr.Nobody in near future.. that would be amaizng.
Breaking Saul😁
Hollywood remake of "Aparichit" with little plot twist
What if this all exists in the John wick universe?
Give my man, saul goodman, the god damn kitty cat bracelet. xD
Does some of the acting feel very off, especially in the fighting scenes, or is it only me that's off?
John Wick but comedy
yes yes , finally someone appreciated Bob Odenkirk
"For 12 Year's I worked for some dangerous people" - Saul Things😎
*knack* Nice 🙂
Home Alone
I'm already excited for this
So like john wick with less guns ? I'm down
I hope he’s got a good lawyer
Spoiler alert. John Wick killed him.
Hollywood = out of ideas  Hollywood = movies about 1% percenters that will never happen to you   🥱 🥱 🥱
This guy is what John Wick would’ve been if he quit for good
How Are You My Loving Friend. I Hope you Are Support Me. My YouTube Channel.  Please Like Comment Share Subscribe. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  https://youtu.be/fB0cyFszZWM
Well looks like a cheap version of Jhon Wick, but hell i wanna watch it just for Bob Odinkirk
John wick has got family
Saul can do everything
But wait.... That fucking nobody was John Wick
Keanu Reeves would have been better.....
John Wick's brother Nobody Wick.
Dont call 911.. You better call saul😂
Better call Saul      BITCH!!!
And another “In theaters only”. That’ll go about as well as the latest wonder women. try a streaming service. This is 2020.
Now you know whom to call if you get in trouble!
Don’t call Saul
Might just have to watch it for the challenger
so does this take place in the same universe as John Wick??
this looks like a remake of "a history of violence" with jimmy mcgill as vigo mortensen
Soon Saul will take Mike's business too
That thumbnail looked like a John Wick poster 🤔
Saul Badman
John wick: dog Nobody: cat
American family man😁😁
We need to kill john wick .  I won't do it , its  Better call saul .
Агонь!
Better call saul two
So when S6 of better call Saul is coming
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO'S WATCHING THIS AFTER WATCHING JOHN WICK😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 #CopyCat
What's that song, that was very catchy
Gimme the goddamn kittey bracelet
“Lets just say I know a guy, who knows a guy”. Now I know what he meant - a nobody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=21s
مطلعين الفلم كلة بالاعلان بعد المن واحد يشوفة😠
Speechless teaser.
So Saul Wick?
*Plot Twist:* "Nobody is John wick's dog in a different dimension."
I wonder whom would win.. Sal or John Wick
_Father of John Wick_  🔥🔥
John wick : Finally a worthy opponent  !!
So this is what John Wick looks like when he's older
don't call 911 the neighbours will
Серебряков, Серебряков. Печальный предатель своего народа.
So, this is like John Wick, but with a kitty cat bracelet instead of a dog?
1:33 ...you better call saul
Liam Neeson had facial surgery huh ???
Have I just watched the whole movie?
Is this ‘gay’ version of john wick? Lol
That's what you get, when Chuck Norris has sex with Keanu Reeves
Это же Сол!!!
They stole my kitty cat bracelet Now *Gimme Jimmy*
Fuck yeah!!!! Hooray for Bob Odenkirk  looks awwwwwwwsoooooome glad he's career is building he actually looks cool kicking ass for not an action star ✊🤟👊
Well at least we know who John Wicks new lawyer is
Is this like "john wick but not really"?
Vaccines are rolling out where I am. Hopefully everything is back to normal by the time this movie releases 🤗🤞
Spinoff of John wick
Ohh 🥺 *Gimme Jimmy*
So, that's season 5 of BCS.
soo another John wick??
It's worth to watch in theaters
Better call Saul
I knew it. He ws faking as a simple guy in BB and better call saul.
For a moment I thought it was a parody of John Wick
Now I want a John Wick - Nobody crossover.
Was i the only one looking forward to the average guy turns vigilante type of storyline, before it revealed the backstory that he's trained to kill. Something like 'The Brave One'. Ohwell.
YES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wouldn't have pegged Bob Odenkirk as an action star, but 2020 has changed a lot of my expectations about a lot of things. I look forward to seeing this - not sure about the theater though.
Looks like a great character. Like a John Wick with a family in the suburbs. Bob Odenkirk is a great pick for this role. Hes obviously a great actor.  Its nice to see him step out from behind the streaming wall and go box office. Theaters only is probably a bad call.
Plot Twist: He is John Wick's unknown older brother :-P
Don't call 911  Better call Saul
It is a taxi driver in the now time
I don't know i can't take Bob Odenkirk in a serious role. He'll always be saul goodman for me
Mind blowing
Lalo: Hey, you're the right guy for this, You're Nobody.
Interesting 🤘 love from India❤️
All this over some damn kitty cat bracelets?
Looks like Rick Grimes in the thumbnail
Better call wick
Plot twist- this is old John Wick
Nobody Cares!
Fun fact: he was almost Michael Scott
The whole movie is in the trailer again
It's all good man...
I like it I'm in
Nobody : So when does the trailer gets released?  Anybody:
Dang its gonna hit Box office..!! 👍👍
"That fucking *nobody* . . . is Hutch Mansell."
Plot twist - This is an parallel universe where jimmy didn't take lawyer and has a wife and wants a peaceful life but whatever he do he always end up in criminal world.
They had my interest for 30 seconds. Then it turned out to be another John Wickian story. Meh. Might still watch it for my man Bob Odenkirk.
O-God
Bet it won't be in theaters. Since everybody's afraid of something you're 98% likely to survive LOL
Atleast 2020 gives me some excitement
damn this music is rocking my saul
0:40 is the old man jonatha banks? Or maybe i'm just too optimist
According to ScreenRant, this takes place in the SAME cinematic universe as John Wick.  Just let that sink in.
John Wick 4 - Nobody
You dont want a criminal lawyer, you want A criminal LAWYER!
who is breathtaking?  nobody
What did it cost you?  Kitty cat toy
Dad Wick!
Ah yes more badass middle aged men in my movies
If i see potential, i immediately stop the trailer.
...You working again?
who are you? I am the lawyer of the one who knocks.
Bob OdenWick!
I almost forgot what it was like to see a noble straight white man in theatres.
This is just John Wick from another parallel universe where the man looks like Bob Odenkirk instead of Keanu Reeves. And his wife didn't died.
Bobby: -points gun at some dude...  *Give me the God Damn Kitty Bracelet!!!*
It's like john wick but with his wife alive 😉
Cyberpunk version of Hollywood...
My old friend...
I'm so happy they picked him.
Joker meets a John Wick with a family ?
this genuinely made me feel happy.. so its Saul's for rescue in this dull time..
It’s Saul Goodman!
Опять русские во всем виноваты? Сколько можно?
Hey nobody u r in custody so 'better call saul'
I already like it.
Better call John Wick
Looks good 👍🏻🤩
https://youtu.be/zg7yG9wp3EU
Fuck yes
"Hey Arthur, I am here to turn in the Ninja Report"
I seriously hope this is I. The same universe as John wick.
ok we got a movie
A good Thumbnail is enough
John Wick wish.
Breaking bad featuring Saul Goodman
Nice to see Mr Odenkirk in a role like this
When it's not all Goodman. 😉
really?fighting in the bus?Quit messing around and get back to better call saul man!!!!
Wow...  He doesn't look like comedian actor at all...
O bhai sab..
I think "nobody" saw this coming. Get it ? ok i need therapy.
In theaters only? .... Umm..,   are you sure?
That's fkng nobody is John Wick
Mr No buddy👍
trash
Nobody  Literally nobody  Nobody: GIVE ME THE KITTY CAT BRACELET
Super cool!
If Saul became Heisenberg instead of Walter.
Finally
Nobody talk, shit down!
2:38 “oh baybe a triple ”
Lets check the comments how many references there are to call Saul.... Yep, most of them
I want to be like him when I grow up
Can't wait.....
Better call Saul just got angry.
Alguien tiene la música? 🇵🇪 #Soundtrack?
fuck i love saul
Is this in the same Universe of John Wick?
Так я не понял почему тут нету коментов что в фильме играют русские актеры.
John Wick?
The cliche train/ bus scene where douches pick on a chick and the protagonist snaps comes to the rescue. Joker, anyone?  Lol Hollywood doesn’t just rehash the same old movies, now they copy scenes from movies that haven’t even gone cold yet. 🤣
Good job Saul! 😎
All of this for a bracelet...  Ok I'm sold.
John Wick and Heisenberg had some raw animal like sex to make this character.
It looks like john wick
They ruined him too
Dont call 911 is a line Saul Goodman would definitely say
Nobody asked for it
If Saul decided to spec into strength and endurance instead of intelligence and agility.
Gotta love anti-gun Hollywood's gun commercials!
It’s always the guys on the bus
Mast movie lag rha h👍👍👍
I wanna watch it now XD
What if john wicks wife have not died and instead he got married with 2 kids ... Genius...!
this actually looks fucking TIGHT let's go
He is taking all his revenge against Marshall from How I met your mother 😂😂
its fucking breathless
“Don’t call 911”  Better call Saul!!!
Meanwhile howard watching this trailer expecting a call back from jimmy ! And Yeah RIP Chuck
He followed Jessy Pinkman and started a new life, until this happened.
"Who the Fuck are you!"  S'all Good man
Ok Nobody Does It better😂
I guess you really should call saul
So this is basically The Equalizer 3
Damn you Guys really showed everything in that Trailer...so when is Part2 coming xD ?
Plot twist: Kitty cat bracelet was stolen by Walter white.
I don't care that it looks a lot like John Wick... Trailer looks fun!
SAUL BADMAN!!
looks like John wick n This noboby guy used to go same school
The fhooking nobody is Nobody
The fhooking Nobody
Got me at Kitty cat bracelet!
LIKE JOHN WICK
This is John Wick if they stole his car before his wife died
It's John Wick but with comedy
"In theaters only"? That's optimistic!
If you want a hitman, you better call saul
Oh hi
Saul breaking bad🤣
Saul,what just happened to you 😂
Oh this is what mid life crises looks like..
+"Say my name" -"Saul god damn" +"you goodman right"
Saul Fucking Goodman is Back with more serious and legal business. And now he's Nobody 👍
Looks like another Shoot 'Em Up..
Whats the music ?
Wow what a trailer i m waiting.
John wick with short hair and very less cars .
Well, nobody is perfect sooo
Low budget John Wick
Nobody: Don't call 911. Me: Better call Saul.
In theaters only? What a bunch of idiots.
Can we just agree Bob Odenkirk acting range is fucking amazing ? Oh, and clearly, him and John Wick need to team up soon :-p
Hey... this looks interesting... nevermind, just another action movie.
Woooooooooooooooooooooowww
Dont call saul
Жду с нетерпением. Как же он круто душу отводит.
why'd he say that like keanu reeves tho?😂
So this guy is John Wick's Lawyer!
John Wick family edition
How strange would the exchange sound going to see this "Two tickets for Nobody please"
The car at 2:11, is it Skyline Kenmeri or Toyota Celica? Or any other car?
What's that bg song
Is this Bryan Callen?
Family John Wick
lame ass movie only white people would like lmaoo
Only David Lietch can make middle aged white men cool again.
Criminal lawyer
John wick poster
Me and my dad loves movies like this, can anyone recommend me movies like this? Thanks!
Is this Jon wick spoof??
Great take on a classic genre.
Where is his stash of mobile phones?
Every single old aged actor has to be a super action hero these days... i mean i kinda liked it in the beginning with Taken and Equalizer but then... then it became ridiculous... Saul is now a super agent... cant wait to see Steve Carell next and maybe even Danny DeVito... hey... why not? Right...?
I know a man,, who knows a man..who is nobody,, and nobody is Saul Goodman 😎
Bob odenkirk! Cool
Basically John wick a family and a kitty🐱
mike is missing badly here

Is it me or Bob at a glance looks like Jon Hamm and Bruce Willis??
It wasn't me! It was Ignacio! He's the one!
I punched my snake plant after watching this
When Home Alone and John Wick meet
John Wick: "they killed my dog"  Nobody:"they stole my daughter's kitty cat bracelet"💥

JOHN WICK VS SAUL
Yes.
It's all good man.
saul con armas
Yo that first house scene was SO John Wick Then I see who the producer is. BTW seeing a tough Saul?! HELL FUCKING YAH
At the end of the trailer he is in handcuffs, smoking a cigarette and a cat is on the table eating something. Why is the cat on the table?
It’s all good man.
Hoorah
So if Saul Goodman is here kicking ass therefore John Wick is somewhere working at  cinnabon?
When do we get Saul Goodman vs John Wick?
Mr. Saul 🔥🔥🔥
this is going to be one hell of a movie♥️ cant wait
Thrilling af
John Wick but he is a suburban Dad.
This seems to be made for just entertainment, do not compare with John Wick or any other movies. I don’t think this movie is made to show reality, it’s just an entertainment.
I wonder if this is in the same universe as John Wick.
In a parallel universe where Saul Goodman became John Wick.
When John Wick becomes old.
john wick casado
Lalo was right being a "Nobody"
John wick 4
Family John Wick! Fuck, why not!
Saul Goodman knows a guy, who knows a guy and the guy is Saul....
This guy is a hell ffa addictive

A history of violence with john wick dinamics over a death wish scenario.

New kingdome hearts is looking very Netflix

Please don't let this has sequel. You have fucked up John Wick with sequels.  1 awesome movie should be enough.
That fu***king nobody..is John vicks..
Amezing 👍
I bet he is an android.
That Nobody is somebody you dont wanna mess with.   Must watch flix. To me it looks like John Wick's cousin.
From a Criminal to a Lawyer, and now to a NOBODY.  Awesome, 'Kirk!

SAULBERG

Пацаны вообще могёте!
Dont you just hate when they show the whole fucking movie in the trailer...
100% cliché filled action movie and its so close to 2021. every line, scene and backstory has been done a million times already, not interested.
That Fucking Nobody is Johnwick
James McGill Esquire
🚨🚨🚨 SAUL GOODMAN 🥺 YEEES 🤩🥳👍
*Nobody*  A movie called Nobody
He needs a hoover max pro vaccum cleaner.
Hindi movie DILWALE , English REMAKE.
Rip off of John Wick Too many of this crap these days
1:13 the synced music do be  kinda satisfying tho
So Damn Funny And So Damn Cool Action
Did he just made an achievement of three headshots in one bullet?
WoW, Just FUCKIN WOW, Bob from BETTER CALL SAUL to replacing Liam Neeson, Holly Molly!!! Stunner, it shall be . . . .
Is that soul from BB?
Everybody loves a gun fight
John wick's breaking bad version is here
lets just hope they dont make nobody 2 and fuck it up just like john wick 2 and 3
Best Dad Ever .
I didn't know that Arthur "Artillery" Hobbs is such a badass. Don't mess with Tugboat, you'll release his inner John Wick.
Now i can say that nobody is safe
i was thinking the line 'that fucking nobody is John Wick' then I saw John Wick on the screen...oh well
John Wick: A dog Nobody: Kitty Kat Bracelet
Varathanile scene copy adichindelo
just amazing! i hope its hindi version will release in india
He got the guns from a guy who knows a guy and so on.
John Wicks cousin?
i know when I'll gonna love this!  anyway... is he once was on the same organization as John? i mean, he legit looks like it, lmao
Masonic.... Again
So this is what happen to Arthur after his ex-wife took Tugboat.
After seeing this dude I thought but was parody for Jhon Wick for sure.
This movie looks cool, and I would be interested in watching it.. but "In theaters only" already in February? Nope!😛 I'm not sure alienating a lot of the viewerbase is the smart boxoffice move here, the movie should be available for More people, not less. Maybe through an online streaming service for example?😉👍   I'll wait for it to release on a streaming service or rent it on Amazon. I'm not going to no theater before AT LEAST the end of Summer 2021. They could be showing a crossover between Firefly and the Alien-universes and I still wouldn't go 😅😛
Better Call Saul
just when you thought that stealing a kitty kat bracelet would have no serious consequence ........
Better don't fuck with Saul
Lessons to learn  Don't steal a man's car Don't steal his daughter's kitty cat bracelet and Don't just don't kill his dog I mean WTF  if you do be ready to die
Who's the Goodman? Answer: Nobody (If you know what I mean)
I'm a simple man. I see Bob Odenkirk, I click.
Saul Goodman is gonna fuck u up.😂
The Heisenberg of Saul Goodman
Better call Saul!
Seems powerful 👊
Anyone every punched a brickwall, knows the wall wins big time😉
bruh is this john wick from a parallel universe
You already saw this vengeance movie ... several times.
*this looks fucking AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
well as long as you approach it like s a B movie it could be fun to watch online
Hmmm i expected some "nobody: ..." comments here
Its always a good thing hide or double or triple up your identity
You better call sol 🤙
No no no no nobody can do the SHRINGLINGS Laka do ba dobi... Nobody no no
Last season kab ara
"That fuckin' nobody is... John Wick"
2020?!
Give me that god dam kitty cat bracelet..
This is hilarious. I just cannot see Bob Odenkirk as a badass action dude. Especially since he is not that young anymore. Its like watching an 80s style action movie with John Lithgow as the hero. :dd
Ngl, if they make a series out of it like they did with John Wick and they have lore as interesting as them, I'm all in
looks good.
Rey getting a Spin-off movie it seems
Love it very much 😍💘❤😘💕💓🥰
Can anyone tell me what bgm is that? Please drop down the name if you know that. Thank you.
Saul better call
"Don't call 911" Then I'd better call saul
NOBODY is coming on our republic day because of covid-19.
Saul goodman
la wea mala
"See, old dad's can be cool" the movie
is his dog named Tugboat?
So it's is John Wick with family..
Damn he ain't suited for that role
Looks like Saul broke bad
i just watched the whole movie > thanks a lot  universal  pictures
kya ye hindi me aayegi??????????????
they showed the whole movie
He is the voice of CINCO
I think this movie connected to john wick 😂      From 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Saul Bad man
Plot twist: he is father of john wick
Nobody can defeat John Wick.
Which song is that 🙄
Jon Wick retired for the 2nd time and started a new family. But they still came after him
Same old crap uggghh why can’t they get creative.
So Hutch cameo in John Wick 4?
Thug life by night Self lawyer by day
Nobody: Who is this? Mike: Idk, better call Saul.
Best fucking trailer I have ever watched 🔥😂😂😂😂
Robert Odenkirk
John wick copy and paste but they added family
2:44  "Who the fuck are you?" "Me? I'm a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy"
I’m only sharing this because I care, you don't know when you're going to die it could be today, and on that day you will stand before a righteous God, who will judge you accordingly, for even lying is an abomination to the lord, making us all guilty(10 commandments) so I ask you to think very deeply about what I'm saying and repent and trust in the saviour who is God in flesh, who died for your sin, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, he can pay your fine in the just court case and in that create in you a new heart to follow God, loving what he does and hating what he hates, saved by his grace not by your efforts.
Can anybody tell about the sound track
Saul Goodman, yeah bitch!
John Wick: My puppy was killed by some bad guys so i destroyed the gang which had hundreds of guns  Nobody's daughter: They stole my KITTY!!!! Nobody：not again....
what is this a comedy take of old man john wick?
I'm so excited to see Saul in a new movie 🥳🥳🥳🥳
When you get john wick from the dumpster
This was the impossible task that john wick did... Killing mr nobody
Great value John Wick
Is this a comedy?
" I'd BETTER CALL SAUL"
This is what happened when Saul literally break bad
I'll be watching. I've got nothing to lose..😜
Second john wick
I hope this is in the john wick universe and both these characters come together. Would be awesome !!
Oh Yeah! That's what I am talking about!!!!
Oh my God Saul, you better be kidding man. You are the G that White never saw coming!
I'm nobody I'm a tramp, a bum, a hobo I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine And a straight razor ...if you get too close to me
1:11 song??
Saul’s been watching too much John Wick .
The next movie is EVERYBODY !
He is John wick and John rambo combined
I thought Humongous saying nooobody from Road Warrior during his speech.
How to spoil the entire fucking movie with a trailer. FU.
What is this? John wick + A history of violence?!
When saul becomes walter😅
Wait for John Wick last chapter
👍👍👍😂
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who know a guy who knows a guy 🔥
Ok so the movie plot is meh and I would usually pass on it...but I associate the protagonist with Saul Goodman, ehich makes this flic very attractive to me. Saul was always strong in character but weak physically and many times a scared coward...but now I see him very strong and badass...cool
Trailer revealed too much, I already know what the entire movie is about and the plot twist in it just from the trailer.
Could see the scenes from Fight Club, John Wick, Joker
I was getting bored and scrolling feed on YouTube *NOBODY Trailer Out* "I'd Better call Saul" ♥️
What's the song for fight sequence someone reply 2:09
DAMNN!!! Saul chill!!
looks good
... That's his neighbors car
Looks like John Wick's Brother ❤️😂😂😂
Is this set in john wick universe?
Oooh Yeah!
It would have been really cool if he was just a regular sort of guy, and it didn't take inspiration from the wick series.
Settled
Хахаха)))) die hard+john wick=Nobody
Well now I'm hyped af. At least some good news in 2020.
Another version of Equalizer 🙂
Actor midlife crisis 101: get into a more or less well choreographed action movie.  I got a feeling it's set in the John Wick Universe, these super mobs won't learn their lesson eh
This is the side of Saul Goodman we never seen before.
I really thought this was a john wick parody.
Bob odenkirk is a tour de force in itself at playing Jungian archetypes.
This was the longest trailer I have ever watched
So this is the branch timeline where John Wick's wife isn't dead.
Nobody: Universal Pictures: Nobody.  Ugh... I'm sorry...
Makes Sense Cuz Saul Can't Call Himself
What’s that « fallout style » graphic design ripoff 😳 soo obvious
John wick + Rambo last blood = Nobody 😁
John Wick: The killed my dog! . Nobody: kitty bracelet.. . Somewhere in 3050, . . . (Gun shells flying, massive chaos) Somebody: You stole my lovers flying kiss🤦🏼
Poli sanam myrr⚡
Wow !!! Very new Story 😂😂😂😂
Looks gewd
This is the sequel to Cinnabon’s Gene Takovic
Arthur Hobbs came a long way from working for GNB
Terence Hill Is the one and only Nobody
He's stronk ,but just a bit slower.. a bit..
'Better...Batter call saul!'
Everyone saying saul. I was wondering where i recognized the voice from
Giving John wick vibe
Better Call Saul!
In theaters only hahahahahha
Amazing
Nice to see the breaking bad chsrriter
it's all good man
BIG TIME JOHN WICK VIBE
that same nobody who pierced cyclop's eye
Amazing action
A History of Violence
It’s all good man
Saul wick
saul goodman~!
Saulman is thug !!!
I love bob. I love his movies and series. I believe i am going to enjoy this movie. Good actor!
Better call Nobody
That's John Wick's father right there.
John wick in alternate dimension
This is in the John wick universe I’m calling it
Saul is pissed
This feels like John Wick ,but it's also it's own element at the same time
It'sallgoodman
- Who the fuck are you?? - Me?? I’m Saul Goodman!!
I don't know, looks like a more comedic take on John Wick. But I can't shake them image of his sleezy Saul Goodman character🤔
When I saw the thhmbnail,my first thought was "Saul Goodman?" and not "Bob Odenkirk?" and now I don't know what to do
NOBODY: You took my kitty cat bracelet 😡  John Wick: You stolled my car and killed my doggy 😡
*The new Liam Neeson movie starring Saul Goodman*
Home Alone for adults
0:55 That left dude looks like Jensen Ackles
Wow! This is amazing!
And best of all, it's not woke! 👍
0:41 Mr.ehrmantraut there after a long time.
You better DON'T call Saul :D
IMAX babyy
Comes out on my birthday cool
Kiduveee.... 😍😍😍😍
Nobody NOBODY !! Does it better 🔥
The thumbnail reminds me of john wick for some reasons
Saul Goodman gone Badman
>In theaters only >february  alright well Guess I wont be seeing this for a while..
Walter White should have Call Saul like he said so many times, and made Hank would still be alive.
They're finally introducing the John Wick multiverse
❤️❤️❤️
So it is "what if John Wick had a family". Plot: Bad guys steal kitty-cat. John will do whatever it takes to return it back to his daughter.
Is this related to john wick? Like on the other side of the story
"Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet" better become as iconic in pop culture as "yippee kayay MF" or I'm gonna lose like Bob just did here.
Project Zorgo is watching...
Saul Goodman...the good man with right amount of bad!
So a mix of "the pushed around underdog that snaps" trope, (too much like) John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Accountant. With a hint of Paul Blart lime.
dont call 911
I like this John Wick movie
So basically john wick but older
In legal trouble? Better call Saul
Ля, Серебрякова увидел Ещё и Найшуллер режиссер
I never thought Bob Odenkirk could be so convincing as an action star.  But here we are
Saul Good man in John Wick
Oh I'm so gonna watch this movieee!
cringe
saul is backkk !!!
don't drink and drive but if you do better call......
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please don't mess with someone else's dog, car, family and kitty cat bracelet. U never know what may come for you. RIP to those stupid over confident gangs.
2:47 "Who tf Are You?" "Me?  You wouldn't Get it"
Oh F#ck! What a supa cool new concept, after "I'm John wick" here comes "I'm nobody"...!? Euh wait a minute... Damn it's the same shit, but they got me anyway🤤
Nobody : beats up everyone Also nobody : better call Saul
Well it seems like he really wants the kittycat bracelet
Is the music producer from South India?
When Saul Goodman become Saul badman
Great way to start 2021
They had us in the first half Not gonna lie
It's all good man...😘  James McGill
Almost a john wick ripoff
Saul Goodman as John Wick?  Im fucking in
I really hope he finds kitty cat bracelet
wow saul is breaking bad huh
Lalo Salamanca Approves.
It's all goodman
I love this guy
Saul is breaking bad!
They had me in the first minute, thought it was gonna be a good thriller or a drama, nope just another silly blockbuster of which there are many. Btw John Wick is overrated
That looks like a mix of *Joker and John Wick*
So..... a bootleg John Wick? Love it!
I love Saul🥰
All this for - " kitty cat bracelet"
Seems a lot like Joker mixed with Fight Club.
please dubbed in hindi❤️❤️❤️👍😘
did someone said no one jaqen h'ghar enters the chat.
will the theaters open?
Don't call 911, better call Saul
Its like some old married John Wick LOL!!!
So glad bob is getting another big role
It'S all good, man
This is  John Wick's Lawyer.
Saul, I need your help
Can he be my lawyer #breakingbad 💟
at the start of the video the police scene reminded me of john wick when the police knocked on his door.
damnnn this lawyer is so angry
I know there is nothing that is worth watching that wasn't in the trailer ! wth did they show all of this xD
“In theaters only”  -What sorcery is this?
This is how the JOHN WICK do his job..  Never underestimate
This is the moment where Jimmy McGill became Saul Goodman.
Better call SAUL❤️❤️
Is this gonna be linked to breaking bad or john wick universe?
Song ??
Fuuuuuucccckkkkkkkk. So excited.
Like True Lies Kool!
John Wick style
They left the bit out where he votes....TRUMP!
Cool. Watched the whole movie in 2.58mins...
Retarded movie supposed to be the same crap as john wick
Saul bhi hero hai..
From a dog to a kitty cat bracelet
This give me vibe of John Wick
"that fuckin nobody is john wick"
May be they continuing it in John wicks universe
Welp, my Christmas gift will arrive in February
Nobody would watch this.
Yawn
What if they did a John Wick crossover and they ended up either fighting each other or helping one another or maybe both! That would be cool.
Better call Saul!
didn't know saul goodman switched careers
Thought that was chris delia
lookx decent.  odenkirk has serious TDS. I have to pass.
Tiene buena pinta.
Where is  Better call Saul season 6?
Sounded like Joker but more violent until John Wick came in
„Don‘t Call 911“   Better call saul
I thought it was Saul Goodman.
Is this john wick's universe?
John Wick Universe?
Saul badman?
AM ՏᑌᗷᗷIᑎᘜ TO ᗩᑎYOᑎᗴ ᗯᕼO ᒪIKᗴ,Տ TᕼIՏ ᑕOᗰᗰᗴᑎT ᗩᑎᗪ ՏᑌᗷՏ TO ᗰᗴ ᗷᗩᑕK. 👈❤️🔥
47 seconds  in, closing the trailer, decision made, just going to watch it because of the actors.
Серебряков...!?
Better call saul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A kitty cat bracelet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 where do these guys come from??
Isn't it just another John Wick... Copy my Assignment but change the font n headings a bit
saul after being trained for the wick universe
Damn he should have never worked for Walter White.
I really hope he ends up the bad guy in john wick 4 now
This is so good!
Tobey Maguire. is producer:)
We wAnt more of John Wick - and not a movie like this from a NO body.
lookd pretty cool a lot of people seem to be hoping that this will be set in the John Wick universe and in my opinion what could be cool about that would be if it was set around the idea of a criminal world outside of the table that didn't care about and was barely aware of the table and didn't use that random token currency or anything like that.
Rated R for brief drug use lol
I love Colin Salmon
From saul goodman to hitman.im in
Pausing halfway to say if trailer ends with "who the hell are you?"  "I'm nobody." I'm vetoing.
#BoycottHollywood
I was waiting for him to see John Wick at the end of the trailer and exchange a "Hey John." "Hey Hutch. You working again?" like he did when the cop showed up in the first John Wick movie.
It's all good man!
Remember charles manson said
Nice...
Low budget John Wick
This gonna be a one hell of a movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY KAT
Every Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro model 60 has its consequences.
Damm this looks good, Ugh...I want life to go back to normal so I can watch this in theaters.
Saul Goodman is "John Wick"!
Lame unoriginal power fantasy for chumps
we finally know who is nobody
Great..மெரட்டல்...
😑 They need to go ahead and change that "Theater Only " Thing.
I like this!
2:06 is that LSD
Is this the same world as John wick
s'all goodman
I came here for Saul. He is my guy.  “Who are you?” “Me?” I am Saul lady.
😆😆😅  SO  Is this a JOHN WICK Spoof...???
Another man come back from dark content (hunterX)
I'm guessing it's the same universe as John Wick so a crossover would be phenomenal!
Вау...такой тандем замутили...лучших русских актёров пригласили с таким эпичным актёром как Bob Odenkirk....супер...респект создателям...
Nobody : "I am gonna F**k you up! John Wick : "No you won't"
Here, have a look at the Family Version of john wick..!!
Это ж Паль!
I thought it was John Wick fan made trailer
Derek Kolstad wrote this, David Leitch produce, yet another John Wick style movie. Some theory saying this movie might be in John Wick Universe. But I really wont ever want to have more John Wick spin off or John Wick Style movie even if they are from same people who created John Wick. John Wick is a true masterpiece more than other common masterpieces, because John Wick is a simple movie (but not easy to make), but truly outstanding and compact, with low budget. Imagine how low of a salary Keanu took, because he truly is sincere in doing his work. Anyways, John Wick was and will always be the most special action movies, changed the way action movies should be like, with a budget of USD20 Million. And then so many wannabes arises, and now Derek and David came up with a same style. I just feel not happy. They should come up with some other kind  of masterpiece. This is what I think..
Getting some Gran Torino vibes from him
"DONT CALL 911" this is the freaking confidence.
Slippin jimmy going for it. No mike needed
Better call Saul
Saul Goodman refused to chicken out anymore so he learned some techniques from Ehrmantraut and became a dangerous Nobody.
"I once saw him kill 3 men in a bar with a pencil sharpener......" "With a fooking pencil sharpener!!!! Who can do that?"
Серебряков! Отлично!!!
Were is john
meh
Better call nobody!
"That F***ing nobody....... is John W....... er, Hutch"
He killed those three with AWM 😂😂❤️
in theatres... really are you sure?
The premise I read before watching the trailer was more interesting (about just a random guy caught in the wrong place at a wrong time), but I’m still looking forward to this. Also, was that Mike in the cameo?
What if John Wick took the Kitty cat bracelet :|
Better call Saul 🙃
Songs got my head and shoulders bouncing wanting the best to drop hard!
So this is john wick if his wife didn't die and started a family
It's all good, man
Can't wait for this Movie ❤️😍!!
Concept is somewhat copied from the family man
Looks like there going in a new direction with John Wick 4
This movie shows the story of saul goodmen turning into saul badmen
Saul Wick
Don't call 911, Better call Saul 🤣🤣
Серебряков!
the equalizer
So, the equalizer, but with a white guy
*just another saul goodman refrence*
This movie looks awesome but I wish I just didn't saw the whole movie.
Паль!
Them: Kill John Wick's Dog Them: Take kitty cat bracelet John Wick and Nobody:
Anyone know the song at 1:11?
I'll watch anything with Odenkirk
after this movie people will watch "better call saul"
I like to think this is in the same universe as John wick
Oh Wow!. The Trailer for Family Man 2 is finally here..
this is the moment Jimmy became Saul
If John wick had a kids and wife
He looks way healthy than he did in BB. BETTER CALL SAUL
Say my name, walt   Nobody goodman, because nobody is good after you beat their ass
If he gets into trouble he better call Saul.
God he is such an underrated actor.
That triple head shot reeled me in real quick
It remind me to "A history of violence"... and that's great :-D
원더걸스가 부릅니다 nobody nobody but u
Looks like Saul is possessed by Heisenberg
Oh hell yeah...
looks dope
BC yeh kya dekh liya
I once saw Bob Odenkirk kill three men in a bar using nothing but a pencil.
серебреков ..... господи у них что денег небыло ?
post malone ozzy osbourne
Saul getting violent
This is going to be epic,  Better call Saul Wick!
John wick retired and got saul goodman plastic surgery
A family friendly version of wick

"Who TF are you ?" "I'm John Wick 2.0"
We better see this Saul Goodman in the next season of "better call Saul"
Directed by the same guy who directed hardcore henry
Never mess with a lawyer, saul goodman is back. Background: (hema le leba hamale leba ham)
Wow
From dog to car to kitty cat bracelet. It been a long journey.
Now I know who is the father of John Wick.

He is like the older John Wick
John wick lite pro max
Don't Call 911.. Better call Saul! DAYYYYM!!!!
YES
I wish we see him in john wick 4 helping john wick
I'm in
-You don't steal John wick's car -You don't steal nobody's kitty cat bracelet.
Too silly for my taste.
Looks mediocre
"Don't call 911"  'Call Walter'
Damnn that triple Headshot
Movie trailer: now in theaters   YouTube viewers: “ In theaters, ya good luck who’s going to see that”  Me: nobody
Plot twist: Everything he does is legal
Looks like this guy has a particular set of skills... 🤣
Budget version of John wick
They had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
I got the equalizer vibe, hyped
Family of johnwick
nobody: an African guy in back ground: ham bleba ham bleba.
I didn't know bob can do action scenes
I loved this short movie by saul..
I see Saul is doing well...
What a stupid movie!
Everybody talking about John Wick and Saul Goodman and here I am just happy my boy Louis Prima getting some stage time.
This is about Jimmy who left Albuquerque to start a new life as Mr. NOBODY..  BUT MIKE FOUND HIM .
Nobody:  Literally nobody  Bob Odenkirk : I am the New Nobody

A masterpiece💥
Better version of the breaking bad
The movie we’ve been all waiting for. Don’t call 911
John Wick : F@cking pencil! Nobody : Goddamn kitty cat bracelet!
"In theaters only" But why?
Saul Goodman is somebody.  A man is nobody.
Literally nobody:
John Wick’s dad
Everybody is nobody in front of Jesus.

Don't call 911
This looks so much better than "Loki"
My my my what an amazing movie. Nobody is the new John Wick baby lol I am going to fu@k you up. Lol
Soooo... John Wick?
WTF... Is that Saul🙄

Just lit
Good but not super good
Id like a dinner reservation of 12.

Wick allover again
This would be more watchable if he were going after politicians instead of street thugs.
Wow similar like John wick 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Saul Goodman taking justice into his own hands instead of to court
1:33 "Don't call 911... you better call Saul"
Saul Goodman become Sol Badguy!!!! C'mon kill them all!!! And still better caaaalllll Sol... Lol
Mr. Odenkirk looking stacked like a brick shithouse
I wish he will come across john wick

They must have killed his dog
See the magic on 1:09
I'm just really curious about the possum in the interrogation room.
I used to be what you'd call a lawyer....
Everyone saying this is John Wick universe. Na this is Taken universe.
I dont know If Action movies fit Bob odenkirk
0:41 is that Mike Ehrmantraut ?
Dont call 911. Better call Saul
NOBODY   nobody does it better!
The family: Gets locked in basement  Him: don’t call 911  The family: ok not sus at all
A must watch
Saul and John take on the high table. 🔥
Whats the music in this?
"Nobody has blinded me!" (c)
if john vick wife had never died
So let's all clear the air... This is clearly what John Wick  will be like when he gets old...
The fcking nobody??? That fcking nobody...is... SAUL GOODMAN
Better Call Saul! 📞
Sauld Goodman breaking bad in a solo movie
This looks good :)
Better call this guy istead of saul goodman
Its all good man
Was here.
Sorry this some another cold BS nicolas cage wanna be movie...gtfo
That's kinda slow punches
anything left for us to watch in the full film after this trailer？
This is the moment when Saul became Saulburg
So this is like john wick +deadpool somewhat
this unironically looks like a solid flick
Saul's new life after he disappeared.
You better call Saul.
Gonna need a John Wick crossover where they team up on the same mobster.
John Wick in a Parallel Universe that loves kitty 😅😻
Better call nobody
Isnt that just the mayhem guy
Another film glorifying male aggression <3
Obvious John Wick vibes. But the gold bars look more like the ones from Looper. Either way, Saul Goodman throwing beat downs for a kitty bracelet looks rad. This is gonna be fun
Great actor. Great premise. Kudos America.
So my man Mr. Wick gets old.
Jhon wick and Tom cruise watching this
So Saul's the new drug lord now?
John wick bryan mills from taken and now saul nobody
don't ✍ take ✍ kitty ✍ cat ✍ bracelet
Thought the old man was Mike
Oh man!!!!!  Better Call Saul went to a whole new level!!!
Like Dirty Harry, John Wick and Chuck Norris all on steroids.
Im not sure if they use the same money in john wick 2:04
Me: Nobody:
Saul Goodman: Unhinged
DOPE!
So, essentially this is John wick if he had a family.
This is what I call a movie!
Don't fuck with his daughter's kitty cat bracelet or else your gonna get fuck up.
Equalizer + John Wick.
Just another john wick in another country ✌😅
Bro i have so many questions First of i thought this guy was made for doing comedy roles And wtf is saul goodman upto? Also it looks like a ripoff version of john wick maybe cuz the same producer made this film as well which makes sense in a way!  But still cool movie..i'll definitely watch this by porating it
Romio teaser Release watch 🙋
Yo this is beautiful yes please
so it's an old john wick with a family and no dog
Superb 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Soooo john wick but with a kittycat bracelet instead of a dog? Meh
Everyone talking about John Wick...   A History Of Violence: "No that's fine, I forgot I was a movie too..."
BATMAN : the retirement

After 30 years, Hollywood has learned to make  good action movies. Finally
So what you're saying is, they'll have let us back into the movie theatres by Feb 26?
Nobody: Official trailer
jhon week old
Is that "just a gigolo"
"Don't call 911." "Because if you do, he'll kill my wife, he'll kill my son and he'll kill my infant daughter."
Howard calls...  "Jimmy, are you still considering my job offer?"
shit...man i wanna watch this..he got some balls there
Nah
Is this the guy who did the voice for Lego Batman?
100% Honest. The thumbnail had me thinking this was a Fallout spinoff movie.
খালি কোপ হবে 💥💥🇧🇩🇧🇩
I'm nobody. I no longer need a Batman costume.
Time for Saul to break bad..
This looks so dope
If John Wick isn't available... Better Call Saul.
That looks Killer!!
The first 50 seconds had me thinking it was gonna be a different movie, was kinda disappointed to see saul wick
Bootleg John wock
So this is Saul's new identity, nice.
Another timeline where john wick has a family
So this is what would have happened if Saul took the blue stuff! 🤔
Lalo better be backed up or just call it peace ✌️ with Saul..then itsaulgoodman 🤷🏻‍♂️ ✅
Mixture of John Wick (idk this series tho) and the Equalizer and probably a few others but good acting so we'll see how it is
He'd better call Saul
Who know this music 🎧?
They had me at “From the producers of John Wick”
Ngl this looks rad
Seems bad..
This comes out in my birthday...just what i need to celebrate
John wick: "they killed my dog" This guy: "They stole my daughter's kitty cat bracelet"
Thumbnail reminds me of John wick chapter 2 poster!
John wick : dog nobody : cat next ......bird
are they going to link this to john wick 4?
in theaters? lmaooo something i do not miss at all from the pre-pandemic days. direct to stream is the way to go.
2:44 - I m big brother of John Wick

Who the fuck are you?   Me ? I'm the guy who knows a guy who knows a guy
John Wick Dad Edition
Me: Hey kinda reminds me of John...  _FROM THE CREATORS OF JOHN WICK..._

Falling Down meets john wick
Saul Wick

Hear me out. I feel like like this is gonna lead up to John and him teaming to take down the continental 🤣🤣
Guess they better call Saul
Yo real talk right here never mess with a man who empties his gun just to fight you hand to hand.
I know its not watchmen but i get a weird watchmen vibe lol with john wick
If John Wick had a family hahaha
I love Bob Odenkirk. This is the first movie I'll see in a long time.
i guess bruce willis was busy
After all this, he should 'Better Call Saul'.
So.. Better call Saul
Wow,
cant wait for the sequel where he has to fight john wick
It's really sad when this trailer is better than most of the movies that have come out in the last 20 years.
"In theatres only"  Ambitious.
SO IT'S JOHN WICK : FAMILY EDITION
Saul Wick x John Goodman
Trained by John Wick - it's all goodman..
Im tired of violence programing...this movie producers know exactly the damage theyre doing...that shit goes straight to your subconcious ...and it tickles your pain to turn you into a monsters ....pcs of shit...
Breaking Saul
I already love this movie...
Let's go Jimmy!
Bob odenkirk has done amazingly well with his weight to be fair to him
Is he Artellery Arthur ?
Better *not* harass Saul
One word fabulous😍
I love all the new plots and stuff Hollywood coming up with.
This guy is in deep shit legally... He Better Call Saul
Gonna watch because I have to know why there's a kitten on that interrogation table.
You in trouble!  Better call saul... Or Nobody!!
Better call..... an ambulance!!!! Cuz Jimmy is on a misssssssssion !
Slippin jimmy
Damn boi a beard can make anyone hot
From director of the movie "Hardcore: Henry"
Don't call 911
This is going to be inside John Wick universe. Aftercredits scene or something like that.
wow wow amazing trailer will watch it by hook or by crook
This lookes awesome but you wont catch me in a theater for awhile.
in theaters only, sure..
Better call nobody.
Better call Saul
lol its auther from  HIMYM
Saul Goodman learn.
Bobby throwing down, goddamn man.
An entire hit squad comes for him.. "Its saul goodman"
Im glad Saul is getting some action
OMG saul goodman 😂
Im pretty sure we just saw every good scene from the entire movie
OMG HE SAID THE TITLE !  ...how original...
The new life of Saul Goodman is crazy
John Wick : Why you killed my dog?  Nobody : Why did you steak my daughter's kitty cat bracelet?  Continental : Put the whole world behind them🤷🏻‍♂️  *So innocent reasons
John Wick with a family..
I’m definitely watching this when it comes out !!!
So this is like John WIck (written by same guy, character retires, he has debts to "family", he has something stolen from him and so on). I hope it's the same universe tbg.
I feel like they put the whole movie in the trailer but excited to see it either way 🌟💜
imagine in the end credits he gets a message on his phone and it says " whoever kills john wick gets 7 million dollars". But nobody helps john wick and they take down winston and the high table.
It looks watchable. Maybe a little far fetched,. But entertaining 😉
Love the actor after breaking bad and better call saul! and this looks like top quality action, can't wait !
I see his dark history of helping meth dealers finally caught up to him.
I guess we know what happens to gene takavic
Wanna become badass? Step 1 :- Get a beard
So this is essentially the same as The History Of Violence?
OOO YEAAAAA
I find this so funny. He's nobody lol
Theater Only... Yeah sure
My favorite Guy. 😎😎😎
2020 : The year when Saul Goodman is done with being a Lawyer :D

This looks wicked. Chicago Sun roof backfired!
John Wick vs Nobody
Pass.. No tanks..
“Better dont call 911”
The new Home Alone movie looks fantastic!
john wick 3
Wow damn
Is this guy john wick's lawyer?
What is the track name which starts on 1:12
Saul's gone off the deep end
Ох, Серебряков наконец-то играет не алкашей
Better Call Nobody
why can't they just finish better call Saul
Got some Fargo & Joker Vibes
Since last six years i living in hell.
If John Wick had a family
Jack Ryan meet John Wick in the body of ex-Nobody.
You can't punch a brick wall like that! Trust me I've done it, and I broke my fucking knuckle with one punch.
So basically, Jimmy fused with Mike on steroids.
John Wick's brother!?
1:12 song name plz
Why do I find movies about psychopathic killers who settle down and start families only to go back to being psychopathic killers so wholesome??
John Wick In A Parallel Universe

Oh Jimmy.
John wick: enraged because his dog was killed Him: KITTY KAT BRACELET

1:36 that little girl smiling, good acting xD
excellent excellent and excellent -
"In theatres only." - as if we were idiots
Better call John Wick 😅😅😅
John Wick meets the Accountant meets Death Wish with a funny twist
John wick level 2
3 KILLS NO SCOPE WITH SNIPER?
The alternate universe where saul was an assassin not a crooked lawyer.
DAMN. CAN'T WAIT TILL FEB ALREADY
Bob Odenkirk? Oh YES!!!!!!
That's a great changeover in character for a comeback!
From running a Philadelphia office to this.
At first this looked like an actualy meaningful serious drama, but then the director just went ahead and scrammed in all the trashed John Wick ideas. They were propably trashed for a reason, seeing this.
I'm watching this
Jhon wick when he got family
It looks like good action movie.
PLOT TWIST: this is what happened to Saul Goodman after breaking bad
Oh it is Nobody, just John's brother.
Glad to see Kevin Costner back in action
Буду смотреть
Can't wait to watch the movie
This is the moment when Saul becomes Saul badman
Saul Wick
Better call soul
as a red rager who is afraid to fight, not for my own safety, but for the safety of the person I might fight, I approve of this
This is gonna be good. I can tell.
1:33 "don't call 911"...."better call Saul!"😂😂😂😂
Niceeee
Pretty sure in the next part nobody meets john
wow looks promising man, surely gonna watch
john wick hired better call saul and the result is this
I thought he is an actor from the movie Bad Samaritan
what do you mean theatres only THEATRES ARE CLOSED
An alternate universe  where Saul fought the Russian guy on a bus before the Russian guy could steal John wicks car.
well, damn.
Excited 😁
Better call John wick
WTF is this garbage?!
I better call Saul... Oh wait.
John wick has a brother i didnt know that
What do they mean “in theaters?”  I thought every theater in the country was shut down...AGAIN...because of covid and they haven’t reopened?  So why am I seeing so many ads for movies coming out “in theaters?”
This looks like the directors of Falling Down with Michael Douglas and John Wick wrote a movie together.
I thought it was season 6 of better call saul 😔
1:26 Me and the boys stealing the kitty cat bracelet
Fucking Jimmy McGill... good for you.
Baba Yaga killed nobody with a pencil, a fuc*ing pencil
For 12 years I have worked for very dangerous people.. Walter white: we are done when i say "we are done"
Nobody does it better
*SuperPunch*
Quick, everybody get vaccinated!
I can't even go to the grocery store without being questioned by the police how the fuck am I supposed to go to a movie theater?
The Equalizer but with the white guy
From the director of Hardcore Henry? Hell yeah
Love sal Goodman’s new cover
Looks like a Hollywood is full  of nobodies running out of ideas...
I yust watched unhinged with Russel crowe. Men he was a beast.  Next movie: fucking nobody yeah I feel the American way  Wwe wrestling yeah
- Say my name! - Nobody.. - Goddamn right!
So when does Baba yaga come
Meet john wick's cousin
Saul Wick
Mr. nobody you "Better call Saul"
Saul Badman
wtf Saul? Why so agressive?
when the Cinnabon manager goes home
This plot again.. Come on..
Кайф! Паль и Серебряков в Голливуде, наконец-то! Обязательно всем к просмотру короче
Is this what happened after Breaking Bad?
This looks GReeeeeeeeeeeat......................... Dont Call 911
О епта Саня Паль и Серебряков (⓿_⓿)
This looks like a wholesome family movie...
Saul Goodman meets John Wick
Looks like a mix of John Wick and The Equalizer, just without any form of quality. What makes John Wick great is the work Reeves put in his fighting skills. None of that here.
Basically he is John wick but with a family.
wow new season of better call saul looks sick
That thumbnail is very John wicky
Action: yes
Kevin Costner is awesome
Джон Уік  на мінімалках
Thank you for telling me all the film 🙄😑
In the spirit of the great classic Roman Theatrical Epics this 2020 short Film is a spectacle in the grande tradition and a holiday treat ---------------------------  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Q6VcMsmS8&t=12s
Breaking bad + John Wick = Nobody 👌
Fucking dope
Saul BADman is here 🙌 🙌🙌
From John Wick makers that's enough
"Nobody is the one who knocks..Nobody is the danger"
Nobody, John Wick, Equalizer, Taken, Red, History of Violence.  Bunch of old assassins and spies who cant stay retired.  Any other movies out there?
Endddddddddd yaaawr
saul badman
Ah, so this is the aftermath of Saul losing a case
Nobody nobody nobody does it better 🙊🙈
John wick Light
Been a while since I've last thought "boy I can't wait to buy this movie" but this seems like it could be real fun.
Accused of multiple homicides? Better call Saul
I hope this is connected to the John Wick universe
So John Wicks father, the Equalizers partner from back in the day is still alive, hmmm, looks at trailer again.
Eh this looks like 100 other movies. I'll watch it cause I'm a fan of Bob Odenkirk, but I don't have high hopes. Anyone else catch the WM on the coffee cup?
Mom but I want to watch John wick   There's John wick at home.   *The John wick at home be like*
JOHN WICK GOT OLD!! can somebody explain.
Story seems unoriginal and predictable, so the action better be hella good.
Starting was slow , and daaaaamn.. after that.. ooooh
Looks good but...  John Wick 2 and 3 had problems that makes them way worse that the first one, for example how John Wick inguries go from realistic to super hero like falls etc. and how John Wick just  aims and shots his way on the movie making it soo generic, Jonh Wick is insteresting because he outmarts anyone, and doesn't go full postal but that changes in 2.
2:26
fights scenes look slow to me.
Серебряков и Паль в Голливуде - рад за вас. Но трейлер скорее похож на странного джона уика
Damn didn't know Saul was John wick under the coat.
This horse is dead already...  movie has been made 10 times in the last 5 years..
The Equalisenberg
Nobody is perfect for stock photography ❤️
Nobody vs wick
Pretty COOL!!!
Surprised to look Jimmy like this !!!
Hey look he did the reload magazine thingy! Let's watch this movie! No, but seriously, it looks really good, like a family man John Wick, it could be interesting to see this angle of that story.
when soul goodman is high on meth...and lalo knows his location...
New video out on traditional Himachali dresses and jewellery...Gaddi topi...Link 👇 https://youtu.be/vLYAC3o3Hbs

Damn that that floating gun shot was as badass as John Wick's one-hand mag check.
This is what it's like to have Ptsd and served in the Marine Corps!!!
This is gonna be a flop ngl
Its not a good idea to call saul😉
wow
In another universe this guy could have been another badass like Tom Cruise,  Denzel Washington or Bruce Willis. Why hasnt he been in actions movies sooner.
Илюха поднялся, молодец!)
Saul Goodman?
This story has been told over and over again. American filmmakers can't come up with something new, lol
Seems like he is John wick father... Like father like son 👊👊👊

Only Charles manson can be nobody 💥
Saul goodman 😀
When nobody comes at your door, you better call Saul .
the real action is coming woooooh
AT FIRST I THOUGHT ITS AN ANIMATED MOVIE
*yawn* pass, let's just get John Wick 4 now instead of a knock-off plot, please.
Por que diabos parece tanto com John Wick... sei lá não tive um boa impressão quanto a isso.
Адвокат из Бандитского Петербурга против адвоката Сола Гудмана
If John wick wife's wasn't dead.
Saul Badman
Better call Wick
the creativity in the movie industry is lacking.
I guess he's Saul Badman now huh
The ill-fated italy routinely close because celery intralysosomally present outside a calm fire. shiny, even excellent excited oboe

John Wick is #1
perfect casting
I'll get corona but Im going out to see this
Budget John Wick
I like Bob Odenkirk, but he doesn't fit in this type of movie at all...
He is a GOODMAN , idk what happened to him.
after mr Saul mr Nobody!!!
John Wickes dad looks like
Welcome this movie
Is this John Wick's reality if his wife was alive?
Nobody would've thought about it coming.  Bravo Bob..!
better call wick
Hmmm  bit of history of violence/ John wick / the accountant
Discount John Wick
Soooo basically John Wick. im down.
Nobody: Nobody:
Nobody:  Nobody:
Keanu Reeves would have been better choice for this role ..John Wick style
Alv que pasó con Saúl? :0
John Wick: Family Version.
Awesome 😎
i read this graphic novel long ago called "a history of violence", which had an almost identical premise as this. but i feel like they could've done more with the story, esp considering how they adapted it into a film. but THIS film seems like it's filling a hole that book left in me AND it has bob odenkirk??? dream come true; can't wait to watch it c:
Lol just guve him the kitty kat bracelet 😂
Saul Badman
Finally someone that could possibly take John Wick
This looks Good, Man
The prequel to the John Wick's saga, featuring his Grandfather
Bro... call 911 lmaoxD
i thought it was better call saul next season. nvm saul just became a superhero or something
Sick shit loved it
Falling Down mixed with John Wick. A movie i didn't knew I was waiting for!
Another jhon wick?
So Sal has finally grown some balls.
Нихрена себе, Паль
Jesus, Saul wtf happened?
"give me the f***g kitty-kat bracelet". This movie deserves an oscar for best origial screenplay. This will become a cult line like "Yippy Ki-Yay, Mother F*ckers!"
This is what i want a ACTION MOVIE..
You better call Saul
You have grown to an old man mr sual😂 it's amazing i can't wait 😍
*  Mr. Wick  left the chat  *
Nice to see Saul Goodman in a new avatar! But wait a minute! Theatres only? Pandemic over?
Soul Goodman turns badman
Waiting 4 Feb 26😉
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its just John wick with family ✌🏻
The first f*cn time the "BAD RUSSIANS" actually are played by Russians actors!!!!!Да сука
2:26 - "Give me the God damn Kittycat Bracelet!" Best dad ever!
mr.Nobody Origin, before Fast Furious. Hahahaha....
Where are we suppose to watch these movies? Theatres are all in lockdown
1:12 what is this song?
"In theaters only".... Yea, good luck with that.
2:37 Ohhhh hell nooo! one bullet triple kill 🤣
Soul Goodman
Must watch saul!
Saul❤️❤️❤️❤️
This looks fucking great, David Leitch is awesome, I hope this ties in to the John Wick universe.
Bob Wick
John Wick with family and without his puppy/dog
This guy is the auditor, Ben Affleck was the accountant. Is this what the finance department does on their off hours?
I was hoping his fighting would be clever instead of impossibly strong...
Nobody gonna talk about the triple the homie hit at 2:37
Why at 1:14 the guy just isn't defending himself
John Wick... A little older..
Now I got the phrase "Just Call Saul"
Who is going to watch this?  Nobody
I want so badly for this to be in the John Wick universe, this shit looks badass. You’d never think of Bob Odenkirk as a action star but he’s nailing it
He's still saul goodman to me
Its the same John wick house Most intimidated Just call saul got a John wick Makeover🤣🤣
too bad its a movie and not a series
did anyone see that triple collat tho?
So glad he’s getting the mainstream attention he deserves
This director loves boom boom
Woow so cool 😎
Yo someone better Call Saul 🤣
Thank you Trailer for exposing 90% of the movie plot, i'm sure as hell not gonna spend any money for the rest 10%.
So basically it’s John wick lite ?
Practically can tell exactly how the beginning to the end of this movie plays out with this very thorough trailer.  That's when you know it's going to be hot garbage that is too fast and furious and over 9000.  Might be wrong about this.
It seems Superb ❤️
soooo it’s just a less cool John wick? Got it
Pwoli saaanam
Do not knock at Saul's!
*John wick universe*
Better call Nobody...
Kid: what you still doing here, oldman ? NoBody: I'm gonna FUCK YOU UP 💪
That fcking NOBODY is John fcking Wick
so basically Better Call Saul was his part time job..?
S' all good man
John wick - back to his old life for dog. Nobody - back to his old life for kitty cat bracelet.
Mr nobody - i have many connections..    Saul- i know a guy who knows a guy!!  Damn
What a Joker scene it has!!!
John Wick's cousin has samw life.
I think trailer already gave everything.
💀💀why did i read it as nobody:  official trailer: HD
That fucking nobody is John Wick
1:00 "They got me on the first half not gonna lie"
I wanna watch that NOW!!!
Saul Badman
when you buy Jhon Wick from Wish :)
All this blood just because of a Goddmn kitty cat bracelet?
2:38  de_house anyone?
Better Call Saul pretty much turned Bob into a badass!
When in trouble, Better Call Saul
Need a lawyer: Better call Saul
00:41 mi corazón se detuvo
Slippin Jimmy
Guys we’re in for a treat!
He better call saul
Jellikkattu movie style thumbnail 😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
So we just saw the whole movie
Family oriented John wick
John Wick when his wife didn't die:
The badass father every child wishes to have... 2:37 BTW this sniper triple shot was just epic
Lets go! TrailerS'all  good myan!
çakma John wick?
Wow wating !
they should set this in the John Wick universe...
Jhon wick never killed babayaga he lets him go and guess what this man is babayaga
its just another john wick movie and i love it
Why they do my man Saul like that?
Let's just make an action film Who will be lead actor? 🤔  Nobody
Now Why he is doing Jason Statham's work ?
He just remember me breaking bad...❤️❤️❤️❤️
He better call Saul for that bail
A masterpiece for the beginning of 2021.
Saul got the balls .  .  .  .  Better call balls😂
The director of this movie is a god 👌
Yes - next need John wick + Nobody
Can't wait
this is going to be good
Nikto....
This is my kind of family movie! 🤯🤯🤯
Skinny white man phff
If John Wick was a family man...
Alternative reality when Jimmy never did Chicago Sunroof.
this story probably based after retiring from cinnabon
Better call John Wick!
Mike Ehrmantraut taught him some lessons
Better call Wick
iyi birşeye  benziyodu başlarda gene  eskiden ajanmışım moruqqq klasik çöp
When Saul breaks bad
So it's a guy who killed people, got out for his family and beat up some guys. Now that his ex employer heard what he did he can't get out twice? Is this new genre going to be called wick-like?
I have a feeling that the John Wick Universe is about to experience a Big Bang of its own 😄
So quick while fighting but not quick enough to take the trash out on time
Heisenberg reincarnated into saul's body
I know a guy who know a guy...........🤣🤣🤣
THis movie hyping up all the band kids now :/
Is that breaking bad guy?
Plot twist it's actually the guy from TAKEN brother.
WAY TOO CHEESY *cringe
That fucking Nobody is John Wich
You should better call saul.... because he knows a guy who knows  a guy who can handle all this for a very good piece of money 😂
Kim: saul don't get into any more trouble   saul: say wha
Plot Twist: He's gona beat everybody and be their personal attorney...  Better call saul you know😂
This is like the wet dream of every american male.
saul looks different here
So John wick loses his dog and this nobody loses kittykat bracelet legit logic
There are four things in the Hollywood you cant touch.  1. Keanu Reeves's dog 2.Liam Neeson's daughter 3.Denzel Washington's friends           And Saul Goodman's kitty cat bracelet
"Who the fuck are you?" In my mind: I am Saul Goodman.
Is this actually supposed to take place in the John Wick universe?
Saul Goodman, count me in.
"For 12 years, I worked for some very dangerous people"  We know!
All because the man had to steal a bracelet 🤦🏾
Fadooo bhai 😎
What about the kitty cat?
Is that song in hindi ... In the background  at 1:16 ?
Call me Saul the lawyer
So the director know one story only
Better Call Nobody
GIVE ME THE GODDAMMNNN KITTY KAT BRACELET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    BTW Love the soundtrack and movie too.
"Oh My God, He's Michael Scott"
WTF!!! 😱
Илья Найшулер снял снова годное кино!
Better Call John Wick
Gonna be next john wick❤️
Song used in first fight scene
soundrack?
So it's John Wick's dad ain't it?
at least now John Wick has a competition
John wick 3.5🥴
Its only playing on feburary 26?
So this extends the explanation of why people at the Goliath National Bank is calling him Artillery Arthur.
Man this looks f***ing good..!
Looks like low budget family John Wick
If you ordered John Wick on wish
Saul is tired of watching crimes ... So he started doing crime.
Likr another john wick
You know who to call....
It’s all good means
He's gonna need a *criminal* lawyer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Winnipeg Canada Film 🤘🇨🇦
"Who the fuck are you?" "Me.....Im a guy, who knows a guy, who knows another guy...."
Trailer soundtrack was really bad...
This is what would've happened if the bride wasn't screwed up by the gang in kill bill

Looks like john wick parody movie
Oh it really doesnt fit him.After Saul Goodman ,This movie looks so unsuitable.I guess Bob Odenkirk has gone out of money and accepted any movie project that was offered.Come on Bob you deserve much better movies.This movie may seem very fine as an action movie but I think most of the people who watched Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman, would'nt really befit this movie to him.
Very nice action drama
Seems people are killing people for dogs to kitty cat bracelets now.
John wick after marriage......
Fuck yeah!
This movie is directly related to John wick 🤔🤔🤔🤔
this guy is john wick's distant brother, hutcherson wick
Please, be in the same universe as John Wick!
This looks awesome but at certain points in the preview ("give me the goddam kitty cat bracelet") I honestly wondered if this was a fake, funny, set up, idk. Bob Odenkirk is a genius comedian, so this is hilarious to me. It's like if David cross was cast as a top secret service agent protecting the president is from a terrorist attack. Noone would ever know if it was supposed to be serious or not.
Saul Goodman transformed to Mike
*NOBODY DOES IT BETTER* THEN "CALL THE SOUL"
this is John Wick 1 & 2 rolled together with a bit more on the crazy side.   Please be good!
HE GOT KOWALSKI'S CAR!!!!!!!!
Better call Saul after spending time with the Mexicans😅
Alexander Pal ? Whhaaaaat ?
Alright, now the guy f**cks everyone up, because they stole his daughter's kittie cat? Right....
The algorithm knows me so well 😊
I don't know what this is. I clicked because the thumbnail looked like a John wick parody
Finally, a trailer that’s promising.
Now is this mr. Nobody from fast and furious?
It looks like it is like movie red where they are killing retired secret agents because they know alot when they work in secret agencies in their younger ages Lol it is so same
Jhon Wick Jhon Wick 2 Jhon Wick 3      Bob Kirk
John Wick looks weird in this video
Can't wait for 2021, covid 19 still exists. Oh fck :')
Suppose this happen in John wick world.
Thats way when you good in acting you can be everything
John wick brother ?
The John Wick universe.
"In theatres" is it really? Or are the morons in charge gonna shut everything down again by then over the sniffles?
Psych 😀
You better call Saul.. 🔥🔥🔥😂
This is someone Mike Ehrmentraut can't push around.
Наши  люди в Голливуде)
ONE PUNCHHHHHHHHHHHH.................................
It's obviously the producer of John Wick. Very very obv.
He better call Saul!
john killed his dog and mr nobody stole his daughter cat bracelet and guess what's next someone hamsters cage got destroy by a thief
He must be john wick's grandfather
John Wick Chapter 4 : Nobody
Cliched dialogues, an overgrown Odenkirk. Its not going to hit it. 2021: spring me Bob, its your year, you shithole
Gajab ka trailer ha be 😂👍👍👍
in theaters only.. so 'nobody' can see it
Hindi trailer
Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet 😂😂
Better call nobody
Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!
Give me the gad damn kitty cat bracelet!.....lol
This is basically what Salman Khan does in all his movies.
after this, we need nobody & john wick in the same universe
HOLY SHIT! THIS GOT ME EXCITED!
"who are you?" Nobody: Literally nobody:
I think that trailer is way too long. It takes away so many scenes.
Is he the father of John wick
Dad wick
i will never miss this Picture
Russian maffia again, what about covid19 vaccine?!😂
Looke like john wick😈
John Wick's daddy ??
It’s john wick big brother lol 😂
John wick older brother?
trailer reminds me of JOKER and GEMINI MAN
Saul GOODman is now Saul BADman
This is literally John wick, if he had a family.
ok saul!!
Finally, a movie that speaks of nobody!
Wow, look like John Whoops. I want watch this so bad.
Is this Better Call Saul ?
It all makes sense now
Do I make a breaking bad joke or a John wick joke....I cant decide
My man hit a triple collateral at 2:37 - sign this man to Faze
Literally Nobody 👌
He is nobody because John Wick is a somebody in his universe.
that walk in the desert really fucked him up
John Weak
if you don't laugh at his dad joke you gonna f up
Dude it's the high time to call Heisenberg
so 2021 wont be so bad after all
When the most silent guy losses his patients  even the devil shivers
John nobody?
I like Bob Odenkirk but feel like this film will bomb since it's theaters only during a pandemic.
Saul not calling police, still in character.
Narrative architect?
Mike did train Saul pretty good.
The number of times that I have watched this trailer is just unhealthy. Action, violence and comedy. My 3 favs.
The name John wick is enough for me to watch the movie..
*For everyone else but russians* , there are 2 great russian actors in this movie, especially blond one, dancing on the stage. And it's such a pleassure for me to see that huge movie corporations finally film actual talented russian actors as russian villains.
So hyped for this sudo JW movie.
Chris hems orth is best for it
Song name
didnt kamal hasan made a movie like that?
Русские есть? Это наш фильм 😃
Плюс, если тоже не ожидал тут увидеть Даля с Серебряковым
I didn't know Saul was not a Good-man to mess with.
Dont call 911, better call saul
When in trouble  Better Call Saul
I think he should better call saul xD
Better call Saul Best call Nobody
Илья Найшуллер красавчик💪
Call Saul for legal advise!
Nobody seeing NOBODY in theatre on 26 February  2021.
That fuckin nobody is JOHN WICK 😈
What is it!! John wick's Father??
Feels like John Wick just that lite version 😂
_They say_ : *NOBODY IS PERFECT* _well , he is that_ *NOBODY*  😎
You better call, Saul!!
BETTER CALL WICK
Jhon wick if his wife still alive
So we not going to point out the black guy no scopes and triple headshot those guys
finally Jimmy Wick
very good actor i wish him all the fame and money
what an super avarage action movie everybody has seen milion times :)
1:34 Better Call Saul
I think I waste my money with Netflix. Only old movies or the own Netflix movies and all is old or trash.
Nobody:  Hey can we do a John Wick movie, but with Saul Goodman as the lead character instead? Universal Pictures:  OK
so who's here after Breaking Bad!!
fbi lady: who the fuck are you? nobody: it's all good man
Alternate John wick
NOBODY.NOBODY.NOBODY DOES IT BETTER 😉
This is the moment where Jimmy McGiil became Saul Goodman
Better Call John Wick?
That fucking nobody is not john wick...
Ого. Алексей Серебряков и Александр Паль!
Arya Stark?
So if John Wick's wife stayed alive, we would've witnessed this story earlier 🤨
I have seen a lot of movies of this genre- "the everyman who's actually superspy/assassin who left his demons" and this trailer doesn't impress me so much, honestly.
Don't call 911, better call saul
🔥🔥🔥
Where is the kitty bracelet!!!!! Best line ever.
Better Call Saul eh !
If John Wick was part comedy
🤔John wick 4😃
Committing mass amounts of crime?   BETTER CALL S-  _o wait_
Saul after taking classes with Mike ..
John Wick 2.0
Better call John
Who the fuck taught you to fight like that?  Ans: "NO ONE"  😂😂
Looks like Soual gone crazy
who thinks this is actually a well written plot? nobody xD
“It’s all good man”
Bollywood has entered the chat...thats all !!
Why did you reveal so much in the trailer🤦🏻‍♂️ Fuck...  spoiles the fun of it
alternative poor man's john wick but raw!!
"From the producers of John Wick" That one still is convincing enough to watch the movie.
*John wick*  but with his family alive.
Thought that was a drama wtf was the middle part
Is that Kevin Costner?
Yayyyyyy🤤♥️
DAMN
Who the fuck are you?  WW- say my name!!
trailer is saul gud man...
Reminded joker
This shit escalated real quick
Another John wick rises
Once again an actor refined by one role. I hope people will see him as this dude too in the future, not just saul goodman
That fucking nobody is John wi...oh wrong universe.
Can't wait
- Who the fuck are you? - Saul Goodman
MR WHITE THEY BROKE INTO MY HOUSE!!!
Nobody is an appetizer, your main meal is BCS6.
I guess he better call saul!
So lazy.  I mean.  Wtf. So ozark meets john wick.  But essentially its john wick.
If John Wick wife was not killed, this is the alternate universe
Are we going to see a john wick universe?
Excommunicado.
Nobody:  Not a single soul:   NOBODY:Official trailer
I freaking love this. I am very excited
It’s all good man
I am impressed.!
old body drag his body down.... makes it realistic
John Wick + Walter White = Nobody
So is this in JOHN WICK UNIVERSE ????????????
Damn I kinda feel the john wick vibes......and because the producers are from john wick :3
I showed this to Salamancas.    They are now paying for the wall.
Saul Hitman
did we just saw alla the action of the movie in the trailer?
Finally a good movie is coming
YusSSS!!!! This is definitely a surprise!!!! Hope they're already working on the sequel.
That's a good change in profession , Mr Saul
Wow son.
That's a big lawsuit he better call saul
Where's David Cross?
nobody team up with john wick in john wick 4 that will be badass
Wow, the Breaking Bad universe is really diversifying itself.
Just like every other action movie meh boring
Fargo 2.0
Now Salamanca brothers are afraid of Saul Goodman.
Dad of john wick perhaps
Good luck with that "in theatres only".
John wicks universe. the retired auditor also comes out. john wick is already out. i see a a multiverse thing happening
Another John Wick ....!!?
Jimmy Wick
Wtf Soul
he should have called saul, unnecessary violence
The plot feels similar to red dead redemption
Saul Goodman can fight👊
Who would've thought Saul Goodman can pull off a John Wick style action thriller?
well, now i know who John Wick's lawyer is...
John wick + Kind of dilwale
Nobody does it better!!
When you learned alot of skill working with a drug cartel and mr white
John Wick: Killed my dog Nobody:Took my daughter bracelet
*I think he should, better call saul.*
death wish: the pg13 reboot
so ist this like a parody? or just a John wick spinoff? This trailer makes it seem like it takes itself way too serious but that might just be clueless marketing people trying to appeal to those john wick fans.
Jon wick next level.
Salman Khan ke chacha ho rahe hain😂😂
So many times
This the alternate universe, where Helen didn't die (thus no dog) so they started a family with John 😂
Looks more promising than john wick triology
Nobody and John Wick crossover when???
John Wick Copy :)
Better Call Nobody
he feels like game of thrones ...i am no one ......and this time for kitty
Hell Yeah!!!
Name song
Hardcore Henry then this. Ilya is leveling up.
So basically Mr White but this time it's Bob Odenkirk
Yep I'll be watching this.
One of the producers of Death Wish.
Oh my god 😅
This man looks like Chris Evans
Who is gonna stop saul ? he is real pissed now .
now they're milking the john wick franch a lil bit too hard
"Who the f are you?" Saul. "Saul?" 's all good, man!
Don't call 911, better call Saul
john wick's big brother
Saul Goodman - A Breaking Bad Story
One man army great👍
Who taught you to fight like that ? No one Who the fuck are you ? Nobody
look like wick
john weak
SAUL !!!!!!
Dean Winchester cameo at https://youtu.be/wZti8QKBWPo?t=55
it suck .... the guy can't move .... they should have pick someone better ... they have a good idea but that guy wasn't the right guy .... the looks and everything ...... dead .... i could have done a better job
Yeah they picked the wrong actor for this role lol. Seems like a comedy 🤣
Textbook recycling the same ol shit
Bunch of people broke house??   you know     Better Call Saul
0:29 is that a reference to the Wexler-McGill symbol from better call saul?
John wick but stronger
I don't really care much for action movies but this looks super hype, I'm excited
we get it already, its another freakin over-the-hill-looking-formerly-highly-trained-badass-guy-unexpectedly-kicks-everyone's-ass-movie I mean how many different types of old guy can there be? The Foreigner, Equalizer, Jack Reacher, Ip Man, John Wick blah blah blah
HELL YEAH, VIGILANTE MOVIE.
this is so unlike bob odenkirk, but i'd still watch it
So we have a new John wick
A really good trailer after a really long time
Bob Wick
Better call saul...
John Week 4: life after Keanu, but same story
2:38 put that in the FaZe montage
I think Saul giving different kind of justice
I feel like its on the John wick Universe.
This is john wick after he starts to have a family.
A 🐕 then a 🐈
This looked soo soo much dopee❤️❤️😭😭😭😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
teacher: who is your father! Me: he is a "Nobody"
Its just John Wick,     But With Family edition,    and a kitty cat bracelet.
So he impersonates as a lawyer to cover his crimes
1:17 I can guess what happens next XD
This is the moment when Saul became Heisenberg.
Chuck would be proud!
Caused trouble? Don't worry go to my lawyer Saul He knows a guy who knows another guy!!
cool
I need background music.
what is it... JOHN WICK LITE?
I know he is soul good man
Looks amazing
How about we call it the john wick formula?
Better call a "Action Hero"...#saul
I knew this is old john wick
John Wick : Alternate Verse  XD
Hey its the breaking bad guy, mike
For part 2 I think they should do a crossover with John Wick.
john wick's long lost brother.
Sooooo, Fargo?
Oh Bob, handsome for a man...
Who are you? Better call Saul 😂
this looks like a parody of an action film. pass
Not today bully
wow nice movie but have we seen all now?
parallel universe: nobody our universe: john wick
this looks really REALLY cringe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Plot twist: his real name is nobody
that fcking Nobody.. is John Wick
Spoiler : forms apart of the John Wick universe
these 'ver dangerous' ppl are so amateur
Finally some normal movie without far left agenda... i think
Is the alternate life of Johnwicks the one where his girl does not die of cancer
It Saul goodman...👍👍👌
Lmao there's gonna be a retirement house built just for all these ex professional hitmen.
Basically John Wick with family.
And thus began the John WIck cinematic Universe
This is literally a John Whick remake without Keanu Reeves
Primo de primeiro grau do Jhon Wick kkkkk
Finally something good
YES YES YES YES SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!
ok now! dont kill a dog and dont steal a kitty cat bracelet...
Spoiler: He trained John Wick
1:10 very satisfying mixing of sound and visual
Ok this is so John Wick😎
The trailer was better than all the hype for cyberpunk since 7 years
me: is this john wick's friend? . . . *from producer of john wick* also me: ok
Is this a Parody of JOHN WICK.?😃
Damn it looks like he's gonna send some people to Belize
Viggo Tarasov: That “fucking nobody”… is John Wick Brother.
Better call sol
Da fuq!!... Kitty cat braclet ?? Really ? 🤣🤣
This better be on John Wick's universe
David Leitch?  A Stable camera? That's the recipe for a good action movie
It should be releasing on new year day
Better Call Saul
after watching this: when he said ' i know a guy who knows a guy' in BB, he meant himself.
When wanted John wick come together as a combo 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞👍👍👍👌👌
Power varatteeee....
"Producer of John Wick" Damn I sure hope this is in the same universe as the John Wick series.
My inner self just been released in a trailer
Stop the trailer at min1, and it would have been amazing.  Now I don't want to see the movie, since I already seen it.
They should have taken Keanu Reeves in this movie 🙄👍
Someones gotta call saul
it's john wick's fucking dad!!!😅😂
I knew it this movie is produced by a same person who produced John wick , I knew it 😁
Thanks I've already seen joker
Saul Goodman went badass since death of Walter White.
WTF 😨😨😨
Why i am getting vibes of John Wick after watching this
I hate movie trailers
I feel like i watched this movie now
Plot twist: there's no plot twist. This is the whole movie in a trailer.
holy fuck.. mah balls just exploded...
saul goodman
nobody...nobody does it better
SO IT"S BASICALLY JOHN WICK BUT THIS VERSION HAS A FAMILY, I LIKE ITT
this seems like it could actually be a good film
im watching this ^^
Maybe he gone crazy cause of his office who knows
Nobody:  Nobody Trailer...
didnt this just spoil the intire movie though ? damn i hate trailers
Basically John Wick without the guns.
Nobody... . . Literally Nobody... . . . . . . . . .. . . . . *Le Universal Studios - "Nobody"
Better call Saul!!
In theaters? Is this 2019 or what
John Wick cameo question mark
No offense, but this feels like a very lazy attempt at a John Wick replica. Even the picture of him surrounded by fists is the same as the one they used for John Wick, except they used knives instead of fists.
New jhon wick is coming
In case someone steals your kitty-cat bracelet, BETTER CAUL SAUL!
If he need a lawyer , better not call Saul
I wish this movie is in the John wick universe
This is like John Wick extended universe
John Wick: Don't fuck with my dog Nobody: Don't fuck with my daughters goddamn kitty cat bracelet
Серябряков, чтоль? Русскую мафию играет..
Короче Соломон Гудман показывает как надо драться в свободное от работы время
Its John Wick's uncle.
The scene in the bus looks like a respond to Todd Phillips' Joker scene. "Joker used a gun in the movie. Me, I'm more fucked up in my head."
That’s John Wick if his wife was still alive.
Another John Wick?
Better call Mike....to handle mr. Nobody.
I got excited at the opening of this trailer because I thought it was going to be a Falling Down-style "normal guy pushed to his breaking point" movie. Disappointed that it turned out to be yet another "retired killer forced out of retirement" movie :(
Is this part of the John Wick universe? It would be really cool if it was. Otherwise it looks like a bootleg John Wick.
He just doesn’t fit the part.
Second John vick
Saul, you better call walter
John Wick's lawyer :
Mom, can we have John Wick. No, we have John Wick at home. John Wick at home :D
Just the trailer here is the entire movie. John Wick has brought back the Action Era, too bad this movie will be a dud.
He's involved in some danger stuff... He needs a good lawyer or THE BEST!!!
Can this be in John Wick universe please?
Saul Goodman after he has had enough of quarantine.
Cringe Wick.
Falling Down redux.
Hahahaha it said in theatres....lol.
if his wife was Kim Wexler that would be epic
I once saw him kill three men.... in a bar.... with a kitty cat bracelet.
So basically this is John Wick with kids
It’s all good, man!
That's what happens when you don't call Saul.
Sooo John Wick + alive family = Nobody?
He knows a guy who knows a guy who knows John Wick.
John wick ka chachaa😂😂
Looks good
I mean........
John Wick cross over
Dude whatttt This looks bloody awesome
This nobody guy looks like he knows a guy who knows a guy... who knows another guy
John Wick older version.
its all good man
he better call saul for help
Look likes Joker
saul goodman worked for walter white when walter died saul moved to alaska trained to be a undercover agent by being undercover and now he has started a family and he is a nobody... boy he has come a long way
He reminds me of John Wick 😎😎😎
He should better call Saul when he is in danger
2:37 +300 XP Triple Kill                          Collateral                           Point Blank
That Fucking Nobody is "John Wick"
So this is what he did after he left his Cinnabon Shop job when he called the Vacuum Shop.
The Kitty cat bracelet though! Hahaha
He got a triple collad
Is this reskinned john wick?
Basically, it's an alternate universe of John Wick.
Another John wick
Releasing on my birthday.  I am nobody 😜😎
I hope the ending is not some kind of fantasy made up by a coward father
John Wick with Family
They came for "Better  Call Saul" and found "Nobody.
Who are you?? Iron man- i am tony stark, owner of stark industries
Why does it look like its 3D or rather why Bob look like he's 3D rendered?
there can be only one john wick. thank you.
Literally no one : ...  Me : ale ba alba laLLA Abalelaba
This looks sick!
Better call saul reboot?
"That f*cking nobody is john wick"
In theaters only? Might be a reason that people aren't going to the movies huh?
Atlast, some good movie
It's the cat for me in the ending.🥰😍
Saul gone bad
The Old Man ........ Nobody 😍😍😍
So nobody is the boegy man and John is the one you called to kill the f&%king boegy man.. Makes sense
Saul badman
I thought Saul was more of a Pacifist but I guess I was wrong.
Better Call John Wick
he seemed to be breaking bad...after all that he better call Saul
AWESOME!!!!!!!
So its basically a dad beating people up or something
Kind of John Vick from trailer
Now Bob gonna kick some ass like Breaking Bad characters did ! Unbelievable man ... 🙏🏻✨👍
You Better Call Saul Wick
Never i repeat never give this movie rights to Bollywood..
Literally John Wick if his wife hadn't died... Even the thumbnail is basically John Wick but with fists instead of guns
It's over when Nobody says over
Паль в Голливуде!)))
Wts d name of soundtrack (arabic)?
I thought this was a meme video lamo i read it as  nobody: Oficial trailers.
Waiting
2021 looks promising
This Nobody will be leaving lots of bodies behind.

One word "Amazing" #priyankachandra
Looks like John wick with a family
okay, now saul is breaking bad
This looks fun i cant wait
sheeeesh  looking forward to it
F@ck yes!
nice movie .....you guys saved my time
So how many russian movie stars are in this film? I am definitely going to watch this!
Seems like we got a brother of john wick here
What's the name of the Jamaican song
"never underestimate a nobody" hmmmmmm sounds familiar. aha - (vigo - "it doesnt matter what you did, what matters is who you did it to." iosef - "who?that fuckin NOBODY?" Vigo - that fuckin nobody , is john wick.")
We cant watch in theatres due to pandemic. Let netflix have it.
This movie is gonna blast theatres
"Don't call 911" I'll admit, that's a pretty badass line.
What's the song in 1:12?
Everyone's gonna watch this in theatres, Nobody cares about covid anymore.
Damn, Better call Saul really changed his services huh
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET
Nobody     Literally Nobody    John Wick: Dad?
Looks like a lot of fun. Hopefully cinemas here are safe to go to when it comes out
Looks like John wick style
How many can do it like him - Zero Keep it so cool like him -Zero No No Nobody.
This looks dumb
John wick ,but this time he has a family
I like how in the John Wick inspired poster he's surrounded by punches instead of guns and  he's actually getting hit lol.
Trailer Production Team: Should we make Trailer give off more like dark comedy vibes from "Breaking bad" or just bubble gum badass shoot em up like "John Wick" vibes?  David Leitch: yes!
John wick crossover must be there
Nobody :  *Official trailer*
Thought this was the guy from the insurance commercials
So basically John Wick but funnier
Man this movie is more way awesome than John wick
Traveled for miles, fought and killed nearly hundred of people, to get back the precious "KITTY CAT BRACELET"  🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy?
at last.
Walter Wick? lol
Seems Like 'JOHN WICK'
Civilized Joker..
جون ويك من باب الشرجي
It’s all good, man.
ААААААА, СЕРЕБРЯКОВ, ВСЕ!!! Я ИДУ НА ПРЕМЬЕРУ!

Elder brother of JHON WICK💥💥💥💥⛏🔨🗡🔪🪓🧨⚔🛡🚬

Better call saul ON A FIRE😯😂
Wow.... definitely not a treat for feminazis... that's for sure...
Saul goodman 15 years later !
who else just can’t stop saying nobody with the beats of the music
Underratedism of an actor
Top.
John wick with a family..!! 😎
He can play a great Punisher, looks wise and actin wise.
Holy shit. Imagine if Hutch (Bob Odenkirk) joined up with John Wick? This is going to be fucking amazing.
Bob Odenkirk is now the same rank as Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington.
𝙉𝙤𝙗𝙤𝙙𝙮       𝙑𝙨  𝙀𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮𝙗𝙤𝙙𝙮
Looks like there will be a John Wick Cinematic universe
that's a hell of lawyer
So it's John wick
I'll cop this. A bit of a fresh air. Good start of 2021.
Another trash movie just for eating popcorn
he's like my neighbor
If there is more action than this, i will be dammed
Alternate timeline storyline when John Wicks dog wasn't killed and his wife still alive. John Week
Normal everyday John wickxxxxxxxxxx
*If John wick's wife never died and they started a family and it was a cat instead of a dog*
Looks amazing. Wish was coming out on netflix.
Oh man february 26 😭 ok ill wait 😒
Now I know why he yelled at Marshall
That's the beginning of Hollywood turning into BOLLYWOOD
That fucking nobody is. Jhon wick!
2:38 achievements unlocked, get collateral kill when quick scope 🏆
о, Серебряков в качестве босса :)
The new John wick maybe?
Remake of john wick?
Awesome
Better call Saul
"nobody" does it better!
That Nobody is "John Wick"
Who the fuck are you??? Me, I'm saul goodman...
Nobody? You’re a Cinnabon employee
I should stop watching this kind of movie, last time I confronted some assholes, I got my ass kicked, LOL.
Now pls better call Saul 😂😂😂 if any problem
A must watch
good for odenkirk, who for years has given nothing but stellar performances. but this looks like garbo
So, is this John wick 4? It seems Keanu got some plastic surgery from Cyberpunk.
Fucking helllllll
poor man john wick
New Jon Wick?
Although it seems pretty like The Equalizer I think trailer is cool. So we'll see.
Mmmm looks delicious
Oh no, John Wick Remake even before the part 4 with Keanu, 2020 whyyyy?!
is this a parody type movie?
This looks so good!
#chaalagattiga 🔥
song name pls?
It's all good man.
Hahahahaha! Wooooooooooooo! 😍
So it's John Wick X The Equalisizer. Not bad
Looks like John wick's old uncle
Really .. it's ...
So when Saul said to the vacuum cleaner guy that "I'll handle it myself", this is what he meant?
His john wick old brother
New john wick
Is this the story of the last cis gendered White American man in Russia
From the John wick universe
Saul goodman
John Wick, but instead of killing a puppy, the bad guys steal a kitty cat bracelet....
John wick and the equalizer in one movie
in the end..i want him to grab a coffee with John wick.
This is what happens when you don't call Saul, he gets bored and starts killing people
John Wick with a family and a mid-life crisis
This is the moment that Saul Goodman became Heisenberg.
Me (to my gf): Send dudes GF: You mean nudes? Me: No! dudes, as in guys, I'm in trouble. GF: Wait I better call Saul  Saul arrives in Nobody-mood to fuck things up.
Definitely the first movie I’m watching when theaters open back up
Nobody isn't some one who has a family,but no one to look after who is living alone,no friends,no relationships,cast aside.this movie hero has a wife and 2 kids even that makes him somebody. Real Nobody is like the Joker .
So Saul is a brutal Marty McFly and Emmett is his Father...i knew it :D
Excited to experience music in theater
So, he left his Cinnabon job, and disappear again to make a new family. copy
I love that actor
Nobody: Not a single soul:  Saul Goodman: "I am going to fuck you up."
I love these days when  you can watch whole film in one trailer :3
This is the life story of John Wick's pencil before and after he's using it
Suddenly bob turned into action hero, I can't accept that fact
Wow
This movie name should be Bad Words movie.
If John Wick’s wife never died and they had a family
Charles:" I knew he is an asshole lawyer"
Another movie like John wick and equalizer.. Excitement 🔥🔥
Damn !!
Hell yeah!!!
John wicks universe.
heisenberg - saul you r the worst lawyer ever you re fired saul - aah i need a better career john wick - hey saul you were saying about a new career?
"Give me the god damn Kitty cat Bracelet" - lesson number one, never touch bogey man's pets doesn't matter it's John Wick or Nobody check this link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2sNKiqZaBc
i love this man
Ok, now I see another John Wick movie's trailer
Injured good
Artillery Arthur after they killed Tugboat
If John Wick had a family
WTF did i just watch. Wish this movie was for Christmas though
At first I thought it was a spin off of Saul Goodman
Americans worship their little girls...
: Who's the boss? : Nobody! : And who are you? *smiles!!!*
Don't fuck with the suburban dad
Discount John Wick looks pretty goddamnawesome!!
itsallgoodman
He learned quite a few things after working at Cinnabon
jack wickalizer
I watched A History of Violence when it came out a long while back and now someone has come along with the same idea. Again.
I hope they make a Nobody x John Wick crossover
Never call Saul
So basically John Wick equal? Except they both love pets..
Feels like an overcorrection in acting career
Lalo has something to worry now
Why don’t they make such movies in Bollywood ?
Badass
Stealing the title idea from "My name is Nobody"? Huh.
plot twist: His Dad was trolling the protagonist by giving the name "Nobody"
So this is what happened to Saul after Lalo came back....  In all seriousness this looks so fucking good
This is what would happen if Saul Goodman said, "I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it’s a comedy."
"Don't call 911"🔥🔥🔥🤘
WOOOOOW
Ok...so he is a john wick with a FAMILY !!! ...that's goood !
Oh cool, the trailer told me everything so I don't need to watch the movie. Thanks.
when Jimmy finally become a Man
This is Spoiler not Trailer  👎🏼 😑
The BGM
I can't take this as a serious John Wick style move, rather a brilliant spoof. Decker is to Tim Heidecker as this is to Bob Odenkirk, except its on steroids and a high budget.
I was expecting more of a drama movie in this trailer but okay... looks interesting.
So it’s John wick but if his life was a little happier and if his wife survived
Jhon Wick's Father 🤷‍♂️
I know a guy who knows guy who knows another guy who is very excited to see this.
Will it be released in India??
In theaters only. Hahahahaha.
Thought this movie is like a parody of john wick
This looks like what would happen to John Wick if his wife didn't die  Well the producer is the same so I kinda get why they seem so similar
Superb. I'm going to watch
a new John Wick here.
Should have never pushed Saul too far 😱
I mean, Its john Wick with a family...
Looking for trouble? BETTER CALL SAUL!
Лучше звоните Солу)
I'm gonna watch this movie sitting on my Schlaaang SUPER SEAT.
it’s all good, man 😅
Паль!
Has he grounded himself?
″Saul Goodman Welcome in action movie biatch‶ : Jesse Pinkman
I can watch this movie on a radio.. just to hear that voice
fadu!!!
Bob Odenkirk is one of the most underrated actors in history... upd. 2:06 holy shit, this villain is played by Alexei Serebryakov, badass russian actor!
haha in theaters only, good one, had me laughing for a while...
yeeeaaahhhhh
2:02 Ronnie Coleman Lite 😆
Saul Badman 🙄🔥🔥
Saul Wick
And when Heisenberg died....... His soul found a new body........# Breaking Balls
Never knew saul was such a good fighter !!!
John wicks lawyer.
this is a perfect match for mr wick
John Wick from Wish
Problems!?... Better call Saul!
Can't wait to see the cross over with John wick in John wick 4
Don't call 911. Better Call Saul
Is that Saul Goodman 😳
John Wick 4: coming out of retirement  This is the "always be wary of the old man in a profession where men die young" quote put in movie
Come on guys, we already have John Wick. What is this Mickey Mouse bullshit i see before my very eyes
John wick x Heisenberg
2:37 real life tripple collat
John wick part 4 : daughters cat gets stolen
NOBODY:   Saul Goodman:
Tell me this takes place in the Wickverse

Серебряков?) Круто! Конечно, как и все русские звёзды - в роли второго, если не третьего плана, но всё же!)
We not going to the theater. Should have been. Netflix
Jhon Wick lite
the guy in the right kind looks like shroud ngl in : 0:54
no need to watch the movie with this trailer.
That's the LAWYER JOHN WICK!
Me: Who's your father? John Wick: Nobody!
CHRISTOPHER FUCKING LOYD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yea I’m watching this
He's the danger 🔥❤️
In an alt uni when John Wick retired from Marine core & started a family
It's John Wick with family...
Looks like the very prologue of john wick. His Dad. Remember vigo son saying "that fucking nobody!?" Then let us rephrase what vigo responded "the nobody is john's wicks dad" lol
Movie : Throws away revolver bullets in style and says , im gonna fuck u up.  Real life : Call an Ambulance Call an ambulance , BUT NOT FOR ME !
Hm... Interesting trailer
"Now available on Disney+"
John wick copy cat !! :-(
I sincerely hope that "bring me the damn kitty cat bracelet!" becomes a movie quote up there with "yipee ki yay mother fucker!"
A masked thief broke into house. me: Better call Saul ~
A lawyer become = gangster
Don't trying to stole 🐈 , 🐕  You will in trouble soon
Can't just wait to see this fuck on theater .
Bob odenkirk nailed it 👌
John wick chapter 4 looks great
That Fucking Nobody Is Not Just A Nobody
Gonna invite this guy over for a beer
Saul became Walter White, that's the transformation we all wanted!
So it's just Jhon wick unofficial remake 😂
Universal Pictures: In Theaters Only COVID-19: so optimistic
Jeez, I wish this film is shared universe with John Wick
Dont call 911...... better call saul!
They stay trying to make middle age white men seem bad ass.
This is me I am a nobody seriously
There are no much movies like john wick this movie look like awesome.
Looks dumb. I'll watch it.
Literally Nobody : Nobody
Nick fury assistant need a raise🤦🏽‍♂️
too many similarities with John Wick. Nobody's complaining. Watching it first day it comes out.
John wick : I want my dog back Nobody : I want my kitty cat bracelet
I like the stuntwork!!
I know just the lawyer for him.
Which song in fight scene in train
Sound track plz
if he used booby traps and algorithmic calculations to get his kills, let him say "science, bitch!", or "political science, bitch" coz he's a lawyer and -- i'll slowly show myself out.
Wow, another movie using the sad old storyline of a quiet guy having to kick arse. Meh 😒
Better call Saul ❤️
Is this godly cgi or am I tripin
ItS aul Good man.
Did nobody noticed Micheal 🤔
What theaters lol.
even the thumbnail looks like a John Wick Parody. lol
Aunque Saul Goodman era mi personaje favorito, se ve que la película va a estar bien mala jaja
Soul Goodman how we wanted to see him for a long time =)
Saul every weekend
We have John wick at home
Pam : He's another Michael Scott
This is so cool. Love Bob. Please be in the same universe as John Wick for a possible meet up between them. oof
Saul call
Yo that triple shot no(ope) scope was stunning lmfao
Love it when greats like Prima and Sinatra are brought into the cinematic limelight and get to swing once again.
John Wick but it's a comedy
ariana grande 7 rings
Who is the one who knocks? Nobody.
What is the name of the bg song ?
Seriously this looks sick af 🔥
What is better than bro or bcs? bcs and john wick
February 26 ,2020 oh wait 2021  damn this year passed pretty fast
“Nobody will be coming to theaters near you 2021”
So isn't that mean he is perfect?  Bcoz Nobody is perfect
From taking revenge for killing his dog to getting his daughter her kitty cat bracelet back time does change
Trump knows more than Nobody and Nobody knows more than Trump.

John wicks Separated Brother
so its just John Wick?
But you have to be vaccinated in order to see this movie in theaters.
This comment section is really fun....!!
Who's gonna watch this john wick shit? nobody lol
It kinda has some Max Payne/Matrix style elements with slow motion and with killing and slow mo. Which is truly nicely made. Very very good
Is it just me, Or does Saul Goodman kind of sounds like Clint Eastwood at times?
John wick vibes. This time it's Kitty Cat Bracelet
John Wick 2.0
John Wick: The one you sent to kill the fck*** boogeyman. Nobody: The one you sent to audit John Wick.
Can’t waitttttt
I am ok with an Action comedy histroy of violence
damn they turned that twitter meme into a movie
Woww Bob 💥💣
The new john wick
So, John Wick but the family is alive 😂
This is totally a spin off of Michael Scott’s “Threat level Midnight”
Kino Inbound
Ok...so i guess the message is : « don’t bother writing a script...with big promotion, consumers will watch it anyway! »
Me: Bob? Are you ok? You seem out of sorts...  Bob: Yeah.
is this john wicks brother
action move featuring bob odenkirk?! it's all good, man!
Jesse wants to know your location
Anybody within Heisenberg's AURA can fight like him
tfw everyone gives you crap for not attacking but in reality you had the incredibly badass title of "auditor"
Jimmy's side job
Better call Nobody
After pause resident evil and watch the trailer : Is this a remastered version of john wick Nope, this Nobody got a family
Tamil??🥺
Jon"Nobody" wick
Better call nobody
Seeing Bob Odenkirk that isn’t (I assume) Breaking Bad related is weird....
NOBODY VS JOHN WICK
Notice how the cover is the cover of John Wick 1 but without the guns?
Where is John Wick?
Nobody does it better 💋
I guess I got to go to the f****** theaters now this got everything I like it's like John Wick but he got a family this is going to be good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Better Call Nobody
Better call nobody.
Like a light-hearted A History of Violence
A perfect movie
john wick =dog nobody= cat
I mean seriously... Is this in John Wick universe??
Better call NO BODY Soul
Is this based in the john wick universe ?
"Better call nobody"
Saul Goodman - a family man being chased by Cartel and DEA
John wick if his wife is not die and not killed is fucking dog
Nobody
John Wick knock off
Better call Saul lol
That's Marshall's Boss Arthur 🤔
It will be awesome if this is in same universe as John Wick and he appear in this movie🔥🔥
Let’s hope they don’t twist any progressive agenda into this, we need a John wick tier movie
Is this the new JOHN WICK
King khan said it 6 years earlier Never underestimate the power of a common man😂😂
Well sheeet, better call Saul
You can't imagine how much I love this actor!!!
Don’t tread on me fever dream, I’m all for it
Holy...fucking....shit...   Saul Goodman... is a fucking badass!!!

All the libertarians drooling over this movie trailer 🤤🤤
This I the movie that I am looking for ....
dei saul miltary?
The fuckin nobody
Is that the advocate from better call Saul
Damn you Saul Wick.
So John wick alternate universe With the whole family
I would see that in a heartbeat - and a mask.
Nobody: Literally Nobody: Universal: How about a comedy John Wick movie starring Bob Odenkirk?
I thought it's a spoof of John wick
Don't call 911. Better call Saul.
Why the director don't use Van Dame
The thumbnail says it all
Nobody can stop John Wick ... wait.
also, why don't they mention that it's directed by ol' boy Ilya Naishuller?? He made Hardcore Henry, along with other similar vids! The action's going to be bananas in this! I'm psyched haha
this looks so cheesy and bad ass at the same time
I will watch Saul Goodman pretend to be John Wick. But not in a COVID-breath-filled movie theater. You should do a premium streaming release.
itd be cool if this tied into the Account some way.
Илюха красава :D
I AM GOING TO THE CINEMA TO SEE THIS, GOTDAMMIT
This looks like a good time!!!
Good to see that Gene Takovic has regained his confidence
This looks like staged fighting i did in drama class when i was 12
When you out number a guy and he pulls out his gun and unloads it, he shouldn’t have to tell you you’re about to get fucked up. You should already know you are...
So another Jhon wick??
Stealing someone’s daughter’s kitty cat bracelet is unforgivable
Gene's second identity
SOLD!
JIMMY MCGILL . you will always remain Saul
"So I wanna make a movie about an Elite Assassin, who retired to live a quite life, but he got bovvered by criminals, so now he's back in the game."  "You mean John Wick?"  "Nah, it's got that Lawyer guy from Breaking Bad. Totally Different. There's a montage where he punches the wall, like in Oldboy, and the Gold they use for currency in their elaborate underworld community is Rectangular, instead of coins. RECTANGULAR!"  "Well fuck me, I suppose you'll be wanting a well-spoken baldie black man guide type character? Someone a little mysterious?"  "Well now that you mention it, is Lance Reddick available?"  "After John Wick 3?"  "Right, right. We'll get Colin Salmon."  "I'm not sure if an actor of that caliber-"  "OH PLEASE HE WAS IN RESIDENT EVIL AND ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR!!"  "Fuck's sake, I'll make the call."  "oooh, I forgot! There's a cat in this one, and we are letting it live."
BETTER CALL SAULL
John Wick + Breaking Bad + Hardcore Henry = Nobody
he's is max spayne!!!

Same universe as John Wick? I'm sold!
He must be John Wick Uncle
Nobody:  This movie: Nobody
Saul 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲 what happened to you 🤣
I know a guy who knows a guys who knows Nobody
This feels like Death Wish meets John Wick.
Saul is a man of focus, committed and sheer f**king will.
"That fucking Nobody.....  was a Nobody!"  🤣😂😂😂😂
i feel like i watched the whole movie just by watching the trailer
Liked it better when it was called “history of violence”
When Saul goodman decides to become Walter white and Mike Ehermentraut at the same time.
Looks so weird but he is my type
1:12 : this music
local lawyer becomes john wick
"hey you're nobody, I mean no offense but, nobody is gonna look twice at you."
Jason Stathman Keanu Reves Scott Adkins and Tony Jaa in the samw movie, please do it we already had Jason vs Scott in Expendables
I don't know Saul can kill people this hard !
John Wick Chapter Retirement
Omg Its Saul Goodman. He has learned from Walter White I see.
Better call Nobody
Well his son looks like John wick. You know what I mean 😂😂
The thumbnail looks like a John Wick Parody
John wick did it all for the puppy, Nobody does it for the kitty cat !
1:23 That hurts..
holy shit
And now it's the cat
Great.. it remembers me of John Wick .. How many of you felt the same..
I like this
Almost John wick
thanks to the trailer, I felt like I have watched the whole film.
Walt: "We are done when I say we're done." Saul: "i don't think so..."
now I think Saul can break Mike's legs
Тот случай, когда трэлер круче и интереснее многого современного кина. the case when the trailer is cooler and more interesting than many modern film
Me..? Im Nobody🤯🤯
🤙

"Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet!"  😆
What dey gone do too old saul the attorney
It's going to be a totally frigging good movie.
Bob Odenkirk? Damn boy!
So this is why Bryan callen has been gone...
This is like "El camino" for James McGill. After all his mistakes, he just want to redeem himself but they don't let him. And he can fight too. Nice!
Cmon guys. Dont you think John Wick needed a lawyer friend.
I'm not watching this till after the last season of Better Call Saul.
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts to play at 1:13 or did they make it for the movie?
1:24 this rifle banned in USA
You don't leave little kitties hungry...
John Wick?
Who the nobody.  That nobody is John Wick
-"Who? The fucking nobody?" -"that fucking nobody... Is nobody"
Its great to see Saul going full on Lalo
Deadass thought this whole movie was just going to be people giving him shit for being a pussy LMAO
John Wick has nobody Nobody has family
Thumbnail lookin like PUBG character
Now im calling Saul!
I personally love the idea of just a nobody who is more than meets the eye, and Bob Odenkirk looks like he will be able to do it well, i just hope it will be done well
john wick 4 without keanu
I hate violence 👎
Fighting scenes looks faker than new vaccines.
Gene after the season 6 intro for BCS
imagine of this guy and john wick just magically meet in the same universe this guys in
Wokeness Pictures
I'm crying... WHY ONLY IN THEATERS??????? WHY?? T.T
John Shmuck. Part 1.
Man, he could take out Lalo with one hand tied behind the back at this movie.

Better call Saul!!!
"Who the fuck are you ?" "Keyser Söze "
Why did I read the title as a meme lol🤣
Not gonna lie, this looks pretty fuckin dope!!
So basically a john wick rip off
Alternate title; Saul loses his shit...
Officer: "Sir, are you in need of help?" Nobody: "No, its Saul Goodman!"
This is like if John Wick actually went on to have the family he wanted
*Better call Nobody*
I really want to watch this
Now we need john wick spin off.
R rated means: Hey here is your thing!!
Yeah... amma have to rebox that.
Wht your name? "A nobody" I mean your full name? "Aaaaaaaaaa nobody" Ok hav a great nite sir..  #Chuck norris crying seen this trailer.. also with his onion.

I'm a hobo a bitch crank....... I'm nobody, nobody.
Okay, so we got old dogs coming back because other old dogs won't just stay put.  Nice! I'm in!
So Saul changed his identity from "Criminal" Lawyer to John Wick's brother?
😀
John Wick????
"in theatres" optimistic
SPOILED already! geeeezzz
Welp ,thats a cool reskin.
If John wick had a brother, that's him right there
Uau!! Alain Moussi e Daniel Bernhardt 1:02 fazendo uma participação especial!!
Don't call 911, you better call saul!
He was chill until they stole his daughters kitty cat bracelet
So basically John wick
Oh man, i was hoping Saul got his movie, but this isn't bad
“In theatres only, feb26” c’mon all the theatres are closed here in Canada😒
is that john wick brother?
I hope this will be apart of the John wick crossover plz
This is what happened after Gene Takovic timeline.
"In Theaters Only February 26" . . . . hahahahahha....😂..."in theaters " blahahahaha...lol...🤣
So, Derek Kolstad wrote the scripts from the John Wick franchise, bringing to the forefront the trope of the comeback of the retired hitman/superhuman killer. So, now all film production companies, are like "let's milk this cow until it runs dry"...sigh
John Wick has bestowed his skills upon a "Nobody."
it's all good man
Once I made a women believe I'm John Wick.. and it worked, because I believed it!
saul baddassman
Viggo Son: That fucking nobody!  Mr Nobody : Sorry. That’s not me. He is Boogeyman . I’m the real nobody
What an incredible casting choice. Bravo.
Same.
This movie reminds me of Charles Bronson's Death Wish and Home Alone movies.
"That John Wick... is a fu***** nobody."
John wick collab nobody
Nobody : better call saul
Who the fuck are you??  Me, I'm nobody..
For your information, He is John Wick’s cousin .
Well I guess you could say, he better call Saul.
Nobody: Nobody:
The only Nobody I accept is Terrence Hill
Why does it feel like this "preview" just gave away the whole movie?
Dad wick
For God so loved the world, that He gave His only son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  John 3:16    JESUS CHRIST IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE
Better Call John Wick
I just pretty much watched the whole movie
There better be a Keanu Reeves cameo at the end of this
John wick 4
IMAGINE THIS GUY SHOW UP ON JOHN WICK 4 <3
0:40 Mike?
Watchmen King is back!!! His role in watchmen was dopee
SAUL GOODMAN?
THIS GON BE BETTER THAT "THE BATMAN" I BELIEVE BOB IS A TOUGHER DUDE THAN SHOVEL FACE
I dig it!
"Give me my god damn kitty cat bracelet" fucking hell that shit made me cry for too much laughing.
Liam Neeson was busy so he asked his lawyer to do this movie instead.
Better call Wick
goodman new life )))
Why cant I take Saul Goodman seriously?
Saul really lost it...
BETTER CALL WICK
Executive produced by the best Spider-Man Tobey, so I hope he makes a cameo. He must be the final boss with his deadly dance moves.
This kinda looks like Equalizer but with a white guy as the protagonist.
Man, one of the least original scripts I've seen in quite some time. Unfortunate...
Common, this is a John Wick esque
Stop fucking promoting smoking cigarettes in your movies and tv shows.
From lawer to assassin
So is this the same universe with John Wick verse? And that Korean movie, agent june? Or am I hallucinating everything?
did he also killed three men with a pencil? a fffookin pensol?
FUCK YES
Saul goodman in action baby 🔥🔥
Saul?
Why be Saul when you can be Mike?
Am I the only one that remembers him from The Office?
better call saul deleted scenes
crzy waing for thisssssss.......... awesome
anybody else getting a Clint Eastwood vibe from this performance?
Nobody: . . . . . . . . The trailer!
Oh hell to the yes!!!
Someone better call Soul!
Wao! Mr. Saul Goodman can fight not only with his words but also with his fist. Will definitely watch this in cinema. ❤️
Better call saul 😂
He better call for a new dust filter for his Hoover model real quickly.
John Wick vs Nobody fight.. pleaseeee..
I’ll admit this movie looks good. But it’s literally LITERALLY JUST A FUCKING COPY AND PASTE OF JOHN WICK
Трейлер бомба,да и был приятно удивлен появлением Серебрякова в кадре,ждем.
he's home alone all grown up
John Wick Multiverse !
-Who the fck are you?  - Me? I'm the best attorney in this goddamn state!
I didn't know I needed this but K
"Don't call 911"  Chills!
Better call Saul acting like a badass isn't believable at all, "nobody" is going to watch this.
"In theaters only" - wont be watching this
Damn what happened to Saul
Hollywood: Who wants to do a new action movie?    Producer: Nobody
This is they guy that gave him the pencil
Same universe as John Wick (the gold bars)... Could you imagine this movie leading into a show down between hitmen? I'd watch the shit out of that!
That picture is straight up ripped from John Wick 2 except instead of guns, it’s fists. Meh! 🤦‍♂️ Come up with your own ideas!
The most forbidden documentary in history: “Europa The Last Battle” at archive dot org https://archive.org/details/EUROPATheLastBattle
So who's more dangerous, the accountant or the auditor?
A History of Violence for morons
Don't mess up with Saul....
It's all good man.
this is not the first time you watch this.
I...     Am gonna like this movie!
Oh wow, Toby Maguire is a executive producer for this? I guess that it's Pizza Time!
Damn, Saul quit giving two fucks huh.
We might see a cameo at the end of the movie 😎
01:59 16.12.2020
Is wifes name - Kim Wexler?
💕💗❤💙💚💛💜<3⬆🔱🔥
JESSE WE NEED TO GET VENGEANCE ON THE BAD GUYS OF SOCIETY
I thought it's John Weak, but it'S All Good Man! (Thoughts are Pun intended)
Damn.. This is a new level of action movies..
damn saul goodman got pretty good at fighting
The first commercial I watched in its entirety on YouTube.
Im stoked for this, I really like this actor
Saul Goodman.
GTA IV CHARACTER
Take my money 💰
Its just another "Im such a badass" type of movie, only difference is that the MC is representing all of the 40 and up dads. The roles he took in other dramas were so much better.
Never knew Saul had this backstory
Lady agent : who the fcuk are you ?  He: I am Goodman... Saul Goodman !
I know its been done before but I'll be darned if I'm not in.
It looks great. Just wished the trailer didn't spoil much.
That fokin nobody is...      Nobody.
I feel like there will be john wick crossover or cameo i don't know
- I worked with a very bad people - who? - walter white and gus
More John wick
If Jhon Wick’s wife did not died
Saul better call Saul after all that...
Jon Wik
So that's what Sauls doing these days
Slippin jimmy back at again
OMG I can't wait to see this 🤩
Don't call 911     U better call Saul
Everyone is talking abt John Wick, but no ones talking abt how Saul Goodman changed to a badass
Its “a history of violence” copy? Mr nice Guy with a hidden past that he tried to leave behind years ago before he got married & had kids, lets his old personality slip out after a chance encounter & draws the attention of the bad guys who recognise him & then you see the nice guy become the badass, kills all the bad guys & then goes back to his nice guy life like nothing happened. Happy ending.
0.52 "I want this scene in my masterpiece: the frustrated guy with a gun in a train while a bunch of dorks arrives and keep molesting a girl with all the consequences"  "But boss...there's exactly the same scene in "the joker" film.."  "Oh damn it..hmm...ok, so: the guy randomly drop the gun before start brawling instead, the girl is a teen and...the train...Is a buss!!"  "Oh that change everything!"
Ahhh, another combatant to join the Wick and Equalizer crossover film :)
0:28 Wexler McGill
Revenge of the Boomer.
WOW.. just WOW
John Wick from aliexpress
BETTER CALL NOBODY !!!!!
SAY MY NOBODY
yes, PLEASE!
The whole story is in the trailer 😂
Saul is fucking pissed. Woooo. Get it Bob.
Finally someone made the movie I've been thinking about for a while.  A nobody with a beast inside that hates fighting for the simple reason that they are extremely dangerous and strong and won't hesitate or hold back anything.  Plus this nobody is kind and tries to live a simple life, as the only one they want to hurt is really bad people.
Who is going to watch this in the cinema?    NOBODY
Can't fucking wait
Better not call 911 lmao
Weird thing is i just started watching BB...             and he should've explained how money laundering works to the guys in the bus
john wick's lawyer
Hi im Saul Goodman, did you know you have rights? The constitution says you do
Kid: You look like shit, dad.  Hutch: You should see the other guys. *looks out of the window and winks*  *John Wick rides away on a horse*
I haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time.
John Wick x Nobody  You shouldn't have killed my kitty cat bracelet..  Wait, that was wrong. Let's try it again  You shouldn't have stolen my dog..  Sorry, wrong again  You shouldn't have stolen my daughter's kitty cat bracelet, asshole.
This looks fucking awesome
Wow great movie....
I feel like I just watched the entire movie shortened version.
If a guy pulls a gun out and takes all the bullets out that's a good sign to walk away
Wait so is this a semi-self-aware John Wick comedy parody or is this meant to be serious despite looking absolutely ridiculous
Who the f*ck are you?  Me? I'm John Wi.. uhhh.. I'm nobody...
Fking A right now this is something I can get behind
No way he will outdo  john wick, dudes got a special spot in my heart
Don't worry guys Mike Ermanthraut trained him hard .
Are you one of the three that got beat by an "old man" then  BETTER CALL SAUL
i saw everything. thanks for spoiler assholes
Looks like the most generic thing ever
Here we go again say it wit me WHITE MALE RAGEEEEEE
since when saul goodman did it become bruce willis?
Ulysses said to the giant Polyphemus that he got blind from "Nobody" ............
John Wicks father lol
John wick have dog This fucking nobody have cat
will this be released or streamed
Red 3: MRED Made Redundant Extremely Dangerous
This is our Saul ♥️♥️😂
It's from John Wick Universe
Looks like it can't decide whether it's comedy or action
Bro. John Wick verse
“Beware of an old man in a profession where men usually die young.”  “Nobody” and “Equalizer (Denzel version)” should do a collab already.
Lalo Salamanka has left the chat
So this is John Wick the family man?
This looks epic Af!!! I love that they refer to John wick playfully, love the actor and the tone!!! Looks epic!
For some reason I could relate so badly until he went full on mid life crisis John wick
John Wick + A History of Violence... still going to watch it.
so John Wick, but he's killing mfs for an even smaller reason
This kind a reminds me of that Denzel Washington  movie what  the name of it again
Im sold. Better call Saul.
John is babayaga,  This is “nobody nobody but you”
isnt this guy from breaking bad ?  the better cal soul....?
SAUL GOODMAN.
Better call nobody
He better call saul
Is this john wicks cousin?
Nobody: Literally Nobody:    No, literally... he's Nobody!
Slippin jimmy
Should be titled as Wick's Clan
I guess Gene couldn’t live the Cinnabon life anymore.
Anybody know what remix this is?
The trailer showed everything. Should have informed us to be with pop corn and pepsi.
Nobody's perfect.
Looks fuckin sick
That looks good
Goodbye Liam Neeson
"From the director of John Wick" Whaaaa... No way dude... What makes you think that?
I cant wait to watch thin in 2024 after more covid delays
theater only ummm might want to change that. By that time at least in this area there, won't be any. Theaters here closed earlier this year and haven't opened up since. The only thing showing movies is the drive in and it is just showing old flicks it can get cheaply like grease and such. Sad really I was looking, they released the Croods a new age at thanksgiving. The first one made $587 million this one so far has made $ 3 million. Wonder why they released it.
Nice rip-off from the Fallout logo, lmao.
It's ridiculous how great this trailer is :D <3
"In theaters only" We'll see about that
Nobody: People making nobody jokes: Nobody:
Saul starts *Breaking Bad*   😎
Can we all just acknowledge how awesome a john wick and nobody cross over movie would be
Yes!!!
Well, nice spoilers.
Well I watched it twice !! Dam
So, Old John Wick?
Equalizer + John Wick + RED = Nobody
This better be expanding the john wick universe
Wow this looks cool. I'm watching it.
Better call Saul
Comments: This is just a knock off John Wick!  Yea but you're gonna see it anyway
https://youtu.be/wCk-y2rhVRo
This looks bangin!  'Bout time some good action movies started coming back. Edit: Amusing sequel "Nobody vs John Wick"
In theaters?? Seriously????
John Wick: you kind of walk through my role here?
I feel like this guy knows a guy that knows another guy who stole his daughter’s kitty cat bracelet 😂
Saul Goodman flipped out!
Hell yeah 👏 Saul goodman with a John wick twist 😎 Now, that’s the best beginning one can get in 2021 🎉
Там че под Левиафан косят ?
Good
It's in the same universe as Wick? Sick
Shite!
So this is where Saul went into hiding
Nobody:   Literally Nobody:  Give me my daughters kitty cat bracelet!!
Я что ли один русский здесь? Отзовись дружина
It’s John wick”s brother
Better call nobody!
Ansiosa pra ver esse filme adoro esse ator e vejo como ele tem um talento maravilhoso  de atuar  meu eterno  advogado saul
It's like Joker meets John Wick meets Taken...I'm fucking down for this!
This looks so bad that it could be good.
Wowwwww
The joke is: "In theaters"
is no one gonna talk about them painting loki as DB Cooper
Better Call Saul : Breaks Bad
Why is there always assholes on subways!
Its cool because its Bob Odenkirk.
Well... the fight scenes are very dull. A lot of telegraphing and pausing before hits, static camera angles. Meh they could do a lot better. Maybe it's just me, but this just seems like a remake of any other action plot. Just my opinion tho. Like what you want
First
that fckin nobody... is nobod
Saul Goodwick
Its john wick with extra steps
One bullet three people  Look like “ dead pool 1”
what kind of John Wick parody is this??
This is like Con Air 2 with all the cheesy punchlines
this movie is about to win the most unoriginal concept of the year award.
Would be great if this was actually in the same universe as John Wick and they reveal they knew each other.
Saul Wick!
It's all good man :)
Has John wick vibes
If you know bob’s work from way back you never seen this coming.
Omg, Cant wait!
Is this in the same universe as John Wick?
John Wick's cousin ?
But, can nobody beat John Wick ?
Looks like they added some Kingsmen flair with the camera action on the pistol flip.
I'm going to watch this movie
Nobody saw that coming.
What's the point of watching the movie when the trailer already showed me everything?
Oh great a family version of John wick craaaapp
Que isso
Looks like a lot of fun.
Wait, there's a John Wick cinematic universe!?
Another action hero miscast.  A mistake on par with casting John Krasinski as Jack Ryan
Mixing between better call Saul and June wick
Better version of "A History of Violence". I hope.
Nobody: Universal: "Nobody"
0:44 looks like a shot straight out of Joker
better call saul after watching it ;pp
Hasn't there been like 14 of these type of movies the last 2 years? jesus christ.
Jimmy what have you done?
I'm actually excited for a movie??? Holy shit!!! Thank you, all these new movies are SJW based and soft. This looks fucking amazing!!!!
Damn, Goodman became Saul Badman
Imagine this Nobody kills John wick in the movie
Who the fuck saw Bob Odenkirk as a badass?  Not me!  Shut up and take my money!!
Feel like it's another John wick renditiona
Wait, could Saul and Neo join forces and become an assassin duo that only talks about wanting to get out of the game?
I love bob
Who the fuck are u to buring so much cash on the table 😞😞😞
This is probably in the same timeline as John wick and I am excited
Jason John Jack Ethan Bourne Wick Reacher Hunt
Where are your Nobody: comments now, huh??  WHERE THE FNCK ARE THEY!?!?!?!
Saul is breaking bad!!!!!!
Lots of Guns. Looks fun
Aleksei Serebryakov in Hollywood
John Wick vs Nobody
Another franchise in the making
Honestly this is just a John wick ripoff
Everybody gangsta till Saul Goodman gets angry.
Equalizer 😀😀
Wow this looks terrible
Why is the producer obsessed with pets tho?
This looks terrible
0:40 I was like Jonathan Banks?! Naaa, would be too epic, just Christopher Lloyd :D
ну наконец-то Илюхе дали бабок,чтобы он снял пиздатый фильм)))
Everyone: Nobody: GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!
Whoah.... I thought he was only a pathetic person in life. But when I see him goes rampage 😲.
Breaking Bad Speedrun Any%
Don’t call 911 instead you better call Saul 👨‍🎓
02:37 ohh baby a triple
Not sure if this wants to be a comedy spin off or not !! But it's not funny or cool in any way 🤷🏿
I just saw that the old man didn't hit the first dude that he meant to hit first. Correct me if I'm wrong
Nobody will be assigned to kill John Wick in the sequel. I said it here first. ☝🏽
Really hoping they give him back that kitty cat bracelet.
I like saul.....but I can't believe his fight scenes as slow and old as he is.   I get what they are doing but no way he's kicking ass. I believe Zoe Saldana in Columbiana more.
I wonder where I've seen the same plot 5x before?  🤔
Trailer: producer of john wick Me: enough 😎
it's in Theaters February 26 where no ones allowed to go. I wonder how that's gonna work out for them
It's all Wick, man
de 10!!!!!!!!!
When Saul Goodman became John Wick..
Anyone else only realize it was Saul when he started talking?
This adds a whole new aspect to "nobody perfect, im nobody"
I fucking love this guy, I'm so glad he's getting a star role in a movie like this. He's an amazing actor and deserves it.
He should Better call Saul after this... Oh wait...
Is that Walter whites wife
is that arthur from himym? 😂
The next Liam Neeson everyone!
impressive
That sounds like john wick with extra steps
Better call nobody
0:25 it's Ted Beneke
Next time someone tells me to wear a mask.....THIS trailer is going to happen!
Ah yes, what a great message. Embrace your old demons and kill people to make others like you.
Unique plot....
this movie is amazing, i just saw it all in this 3m video
I am searching for  Nobody, Nobody  "Does it better"
Awesome
The Family Man🤤
or when john wick gets old
So modern rambo
Thats hitman as a middle class man
So this is basically Better Call Saul Wick......................
Good
So this is just John Wick but with comedy?
I'm so excited to watch this movie! Gaaah!! Been starved for a good flick for far too long and who better than Saul to fill that void?! Is there anything this man can't do?! BOB! WE LOVE YA MAN!! PS when is the next season of Better Call Saul? I'm not having this "cancelled" sh**.
I prefer Terrence Hill's "Nobody"
john wick 3.5
Илюха красавец, прорываешься в Голливуд !
Buddha hoga tera bap sequel
Universal Pictures: in theaters only. Covid: hold my beer.
I'm happy that Saul finally changed identity and started a family but it's a pity that his old customers keep tormenting him.
This movie looks fun, but---   Fuck the theatres-- go to streaming services....
It'saul good man 🔥
If this guy doesnt team up with John Wick... We riot!!
Great! I've seen the whole movie
This new Joker John Wicker movie looks good
that fuking nobody?
Guy sits down "You're Nobody" The other guy looks at him and says "Shh, don't tell anyone'
This is animation or real😳😳😳❓
Father of John Wick :-)
Damn the producer of John Wick,can't wait to watch...
Being Saul wasn't  enough for Jimmy....he  had to become Nobody
I knew they produced John wick, has John wick written all over it.
What if this guy joins John wick in John wick 3😂
trailer is wowwwwwwwwwww... just waiting for release,,,, love from India
What an original idea
UI Saul!!!!?????🤭🤭🤭🤭
Some fight scenes are too slow and too choreographed but overall you can tell it's already a good movie
It's all good, man!
Saul Goodman is a fucking badass who the fuck knew!
Nobody vs. John Wick
Plot Twist: Jimmy called Ed the vacuum guy and told him to make him new identity
John Wick but if he stared a family.
The most unrealistic moment of this movie was when 3 white guys got on public transportation and started messing with people.
saul after retirement 😅
Looks good
Hope the cat at the end doesn’t die
4 grown ass dudes can't fight a man. Wtf
CRIMINAL LAWYER  We saw the lawyer It's time for the criminal
Better call Saul for him
"I'm nobody's lawyer"  This dialogue from Breaking bad has got a new meaning now https://youtu.be/VM_5_vQ7nek
looks amazing, cant wait to see it!
Is this in the breaking bad universe?
if john whick had family XD dat would be the movie :D :D :D :D :D  hands down 10/10
I liked when I thought he was an amateur. But he is CIA
Saul Wicked 1
You Don't Mess with the Saul Goodman. I'm waiting for this movie.
and the song ?
John wick 3
I did'nt knew saul was part time hitman😂
KICK ASS AWESOME👍🏻🤘🏻😍
Finally Louis prima be getting the representation he deserves
youtube commenters know a lot about this "nobody" character
If this shit pandemic is. Not here still I go. See it.  But. In the.  Mean time. Netflix
How many rogue agents vs an organisation do we have to see before we all get bored lmao
Of course I like this movie... 👍
Is cheesy John wick spoof,looks fun
John wick DLC
Everyone talking about John Wick but nobody remembers A History of Violence...
up coming John Wick hehehe
Фильм, официально проспонсированный русской мафией
Fuck Netflix and Hotstar and what not! 2:56
Looks like Spin-off of John Wick
ill recognize that forehead everywhere
Uh-oh. Better call Saul.
When you mix Deadpool with John Wick
Everyone in comments: "That fucking Nobody is John Wick!"
Arya Stark approves.
Here comes another John Wick!!!
In a nutshell while Keanu was off to Cyberpunk, he made another John Wick just with Saul... Guess it's all good man...
John wick vibes 😏
Alright, I'll be actually commenting on the trailer instead of spewing mindless crap like most of the comments in here. This trailer has me hyped; I love Bob Odenkirk as an actor! The action looks pretty decent, not too over-the-top, which is very good! It didn't give too much away, so it's a nice change from most trailers.  I might actually go see it in theaters the first week it comes out because fuck the fake pandemic!
What he needs is a criminal-lawyer.
If he's wife is still kim this will be more good
Is that Kevin costner
Hey thats my movie
It's like a John Wick rip-off       I'm not complaning
Better call John Wick)
The BEST spin-off John Wick. Also thanks for showing me the movie and not the trailer! :)
Why is this not a part of the Breaking Bad Universe. The storyline is apt to be in the sequence of Nobody, Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad.
Amazing ... why would you not cast keanu reeves in this movie? I mean it was shouting john wick all the way  Agree👇
Saul look pissed
They should have cast John Cena for this role , the title would have fit him perfectly as nobody can see the hero during the entire movie
In parallel universe of John Wick
Now it's about a bracelet. Next big movie is about a guy who isn't named properly and kill half the town in retribution.
WTF HAPPENED TO SAUL GODMAN?
I hope this is in the John Wick Universe
He is the auditor. One of the Auditor? From John Wick universe?
Spoiler:He is a John Wick's lawyer
last line remids me of that charles manson interview
well, better call saul
Who thought it is better call Saul 😂😂
Seems like john wick
It's crazy how day can turn a comedian guy who never been on a action type role and make him look like jhon wick 🤣🤣🤣 ...
So he's basically Albuquerque's John Wick aka Slippin' Jimmy with a family that's still alive and needs protecting instead of avenging.
It's all good man~
Better call John wick because the ultimatum is about to die hard
Reminds me of the movie R.E.D. (Bruce Willis).
2:06 Серебряков??
தமிழ் மக்களே
He must be the father of john wick 😅
Looks really great, love bob odenkirk.
"For 12 years i worked for some ver bad people" Walter White: "You're god damn right"
I hope it comes in John wick universe
Nice summary of the whole movie
Just waoo🔥
hopefully, he calls saul to get him out of any trouble...
I know a guy who knows a guy
3 kill - no scope, for the win..
I never knew making movies was essential work. We can't go to work or school though.
2:44 :-Who the f*** are you    Jimmy "Jimmy McGill"
He better call soul!
I think Liam nesson would be better choice for this role....
Better Not Mess with Saul
POP OFF BOB
Clearly it in the John Wick universe cause did you see the gold slab thingies!?
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACLET!!!"  NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I THINK I'D HEAR THAT IN AN ACTION MOVIE, WITH SAUL GOODMAN
2021's already looking good. 😎
Olha, um easter egg ou um plot twist com John Wick seria beeeem interessante hahahaha
This is one of those adds I saw on YouTube that made me watch the whole thing and I didn't dare to skip it
It's pretty obvious it's from the same producer as John Wick. Not complaining though.
I am pleased to see this Actor is getting more attention, I loved his acting in "Better call soul".
Heisenberg: "OK, we're done. I'll just be going now."
2:50 Cops: Do you need a Lawyer? Nobody: Yes Literally Nobody: Well, About that...
Walter thought our sallie well!! You better call Saul now
Damn!!!
Fuc covid ... i will go watch this in the theater when it comes out
John wick!!!?
because he was in BB thats why it so popular if it was different actor you would no give a shit
Wtf ... john wick saga continues! Loved the trailer... I wish there is a cameo of john Wick!... these guys are sick and making sick movies... love it!🤩
Its literally John wick 1 2 3's plot in one movie
John wick Lite !
and his name is jimmy mcgile
This looks really really good
Demasiada produccion para argumentos tan basicos.
When do russian mafia members take a bus
Dont call 911...better call saul
Wow, that looks incredible.. huge fan of Odenkirk as well.
This man Saul will win Oscar very soon.  Mark my word.
Is that Sacha Baron Cohen singing at 1:14?
saul
Me, hearing the soundtrack: sounds like a choice of music by Naishuller. Me, seeing Russian actor playing Russian gopnik-thug in train: it should be Naishuller. Me, seeing action scenes, close-ups, scene shot from a gun point: I believe it's Ilya Naishuller. . . Last frame of trailer: Directed by Ilya Naishuller Me: Who would've guessed.
Thanks, i saw the best parts from the movie. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Thanks. Just seen the entire film. Why can't they make good trailers anymore? There's nothing left to discover by watching the film now.
John wick's awkward cousin.
😲😲 I love this kind movies more than super hero movie's ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Finally a movie that doesn't look like woke trash.
Aaaaall aboaaaard the Hyyyyyyyyyyype Traaaaaaaaain *Chooooo-choooooooooo*
IS THIS BETTER CALL SAUL SEASON 6
Low quality John Wick 😆
Literally nobody
Is this some kind of message that Jimmy after being Saul Goodman and change his name CHANGE is name again and make a Family?  :0
And this year the Oscar goes to nobody.
Okay this is wicks cousin
This actually looks promising
FINALLY A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MOVIE!!!! lol. Looks great.
and i am waiting for new season for bsc and he is here damn
🔥
Great use of Louis Prima 😁
First i think it's kevin Costner.... Yes...Full fill action movie...have Hope in trailer
1:33 Don't call 911  You Better Call Saul
why it's not with Amazon or Netflix, theatres won't open in Feb 2021
It's look later like old John wick is here.....
Just imagine if he's friends with John Wick.
"Don't call 911" "Then whom should we call?" "better call saul"
Dont call 911  Better call saul
Серебряков, серьёзно?
great trailer let's hope it's a good john wick spin off
Everybody: Literally Everybody:  Nobody: Give me the kitty cat braclet!!!
trying to milk that john wick
“I’m Slippin’ Jimmy!”
Another John wick
So funny to see Bob Odenkirk on being on the receiving end of the Police interrogation table. Though I guess he always is as a Public Defendant.
Looks good!!!
At last!! Mr.Nobody got his own film. The missing part is theres no any other fast and furious character
what if... john wick had a family
Should  create a John Wick Universe, where people like Nobody, Wick and others  team up to annihilate the High Table
Better call the Nobody
"What are you still doing here old man?" - Tommy Wiseau.
Это что, Паль в автобусе?
Nobody:  Literally nobody:  Nobody: I am Nobody.
I'm so glad to see Saul Breaking Bad.
nobody does it better
Society: traditional masculinity is bad! Also society: hey, who wants to watch this manly man display key traits of traditional masculinity by killing people in brutal, violent fashion to protect his traditional American family?
wohn jick
is it a john wick rip off?  yes   is it awesome?  you are goddamn right it is!
Is that marshalls boss in himym??
Saul Wick :D
I am from india the universal should dubbed it in hindi and also release it in india.
Its all good man ;)
It's gonna be Exciting
fake everyone knows there will be another lockdown
When John Wick have family. 1:32 he speak and act very similar to John Wick
UZI is the fastest AR Gun Which he picked in the last....
Just saw the whole fucking movie.... fuck... why do they keep doing that ????
Wow Mr. Good Soulmen 👏👏👏👏
He is perfect Cause nobody is perfect.
That is gonna be epic.
So this is what happpens to Saul after Breaking Bad 😂
Better Call Nobody.
I guess Saul called himself 🤷🏾‍♂️
2 hour movie in 3 minutes.  👌
Better call Saul
"Better Caul Sa.. John wick"
Nobody called Saul ✋🏻🥸
John Wick would be Nobody if his wife wouldn't have died
The trailer actually looks dope
He once knew somebody who knew somebody else that knew someone. Little did we know, he was nobody himself all along.
This trailer must be using all the good stuff in the film.  I wish to be wrong, but this just feels like it covered near everything you can see in the film.
Wick flick with the MP-7?  Ok, you got me.
John Wick: insurrection? Wtf is this.
Better call nobody!
IT'S ALL GOOD MAN!!!
Goddamn Saul is the DANGER.
wow
Wow!
In theaters only... good luck with that.
The Quite Kid.
watched the whole movie in the trailer, thanks Universal
So this is like "Average Joe Wick"?
Saul got tired of being called
Better call Saul.
C'mon Steve. You can do better that this clichéd bullshit
Are ye vhi h kya better call soul wala😂
wow, saul goodman is breaking bad for real now
Looks like a cool version of john wick but I think it's pretty lame.. It shows that the writers have no new content.
Better call saul 👈😉👈
That nobody is Nahin wick
What's the song name?
Looks like he has A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE.
это приквел к Горько? Этого персонажа потом депортировали на родину, чтобы он потом на свадьбах пиздел про доклад боженьке?
It's John wick more of dailogues and humour
Looks like a copy of John wick
Definitely watch this movie
Nobody This film:

Another pile of shit incoming. Sad, Bob Odenkirk steped in it. Another talentless action movie with idiotic action scenes staging and horrible gun sounds, like in pukable john shit-wick. But people mostly are shiteaters and will eat this garbage with pleasure.
this would be interesting since most assassin movies don't have family or their family is dead.
It’s Saul good man
Damn I feel like I watched the entire movie already. Lol
POV: You didn't call Saul
We already got Liam neeson, and we got john wick tbh we don't need another
Bruce Willis vibes of a character here
Don't call 911 . . It's all good man!
Trailer is giving me a headache, waste of time , heavily influenced by indian movies
stupid... this trailer just blew out the Surprise Factor. :-(  this could have been the next The Equalizer with the touch of Deadpool
history of violence in a modern 2020 way
Spin off to John Wick - Like John Wick Parody - Comment
Another aim-hack, rough, badass, 1vAll guy
so basically "john wick "+ "A history of violence "+ saul goodman
John Wick Kitty Cat Version
Music & lyrics- nobody.....
Guy: “I once killed John Wick’s dog.” Me: “That’s nothing, I once looked at an auditor funny.”
I know a guy who knows a guy
John wick 4 with new cast 😀😀😀
One of those trailers where they show you the entire movie
Bob Odenkirk.... fucking beast .....

Only 2 millions views here?? "Nobody" really cared about this trailer.
Почему это в укр трендах?
John Wick 20 years later
This looks awesome
john wick and punisher combined.
this is the same universo of jhon wick ?
Nobody:      Nobody:
So, John Wick and Better Call Saul doing Guns Akimbo like movie, interesting...
This came out of nowhere. Definitely excited to see Saul Goodman kick some ass.
Is this a person who takes care of john wick?!!!!
He is like john wick but old
Saul Goodman looks different here
Needs more Keanu
Saul Goddamn
Not enough Keanu
YO SOY ABOGADO
Saul Goodman as John wick. That is going to be awesome
John Wick : promo 1991 Nobody : promo 1987 (=P
In February 26 Corona:- is this a personal attack or something.

Generic bland action movie
I checked the replies expecting Saul jokes. And I wasn’t disappointed.
Better call Nobody!
Is this John Wick as a father?
Xyяce, Илюха фильм снял!
Lawyer jaja
They're redoing "A History of Violence"?
I like Saul. I like cats. I will see this shit.
Nobody: Nobody
Know we finally know what he did before he became a lawyer
Covid or not, I'm not going to theatres to watch movies. Too bad, it looks like a worthy addition to my BD collection.
"In Theaters Only" Well, good luck with that.
Keith Sweat- Nobody
"For 12 years, I worked for some very dangerous people."   *flashbacks to Better Call Saul 'Bagman' shootout*
This is basically John wick, but actually it's much more like The Equlizer by Denzel Washington, wasted talent smh
John wick in parallel universe ,where his wife is alive ,have children
Comments are gold

It won't be believable, sorry.
I know a guy who knows a guy who? Nobody!
Are you in danger?Better call Saul!
so, it's John Wick but with Saul Goodman...
That triple collat was insane I need to copy his sens
Look if this movie was a comedy movie with the same storyline,  I would love it.  But its just a ripoff of John Wick. So dislike
Saul wick
So the creator of John Wick decided to create a movie 98% like John Wick, surely gonna work out bud, unless they are both in the same universe and there will be a moment they both get together in the same movie to fuck shit up.
Do not steal the kitty car bracelet
What has come to this world, A Nobody kills everybody 😶
yawn
Pahd

S'ALL GOOD, MAN
Better Call Saul😍 love from 🇮🇳India
Seems like a alternative time line in which john wick had a family with his wife.
Is he Saul goodman
This is a slightly older, yet slightly younger version of Bruce Willis in Death Wish
2:21 kill bill action scene
Better call soul🙄

Seems like john wick brother 😂😂😂😂
Its all good man!
"This fuck'n nobody...  Is Saul Goodman"
He know how block the law.  He will escap.
Is that a remake of John Wick?? that look weird
This was an alternate script to John Wick which got shelved, but finally got materialised. Convince me otherwise.
Saul? Is that you?
If John's wife hadn't died 🤣
The biggest lie of 2020 and 202 "In Theatres only"
Looks like John Wick mixed with A History Of Violence, with a bit of Death Wish/ Joker sprinkled in
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT A MOVIE
"Please be netflix please be netflix"... "In theatres only blah blah blah" - damnit!
Oh, they finally made a movie about me, a nobody, cool. o.o
Going to be hell of a picture, damn excited, the lawyer is going to make some mess.
It's all good man
Younger missing brother of Walter white😉
Is this John Wick in 20 Years?
That's some badass shit, freaking one punch man.
Dont call 911, you better Call Saul
Боб Оденкёрк в фильме Ильи Найшуллера. Смотрим!
Basically John Wick with a family.
100% he has erectile dysfunction and it's all in his head.
John Wick has a new rival
Looks like a spin off of The Equalizer
John wicks rebirth.. damn!!!

Saul goodman as a badass old man and good at fighting. How cool is that🔥🔥
Saul is doing great.
goosebump gauranted
Anyone tell me what's the name of the song
RORSHACH!!! AM I THE ONLY ONE???
I love these free short movies😍
Awesome trailer
Waiting by Heart
Looks like all the stunt sequences in the movie are in the trailer.
Thought maybe it was another falling down story and  was excited but it’s just another formulaic ex assassin story.
my life -as a poet
How do you stop bullshit like this from Hollywood?  Don't pay to see it.  John Wick is enough.
Looking forward to see it. Look amazing
Plot Twist: This is Saul after Breaking Bad
Goes without saying but still. Definitely watching this.
“For 12 years I worked for some very dangerous peoples”  Walter White: Your welcome Saul
I don't know, I liked where it was going until the bus scene, then after that it got full-blown action movie and I kind of lost interest. A psychological thriller where Bob Odenkirk gets more and more violent? Sign me up. An action movie which seems another John Wick? Meh.
This seems to be super awsum😍😍
I'll be the first to say that I know that this movie is going to piss off and trigger a whole lot of people and I AM LIVING FOR IT.
I know a guy who knows a guy
So basically John Wick but they stole kitty cat bracelet.
Thanks for giving away the movie in one trailer lol. Still gunna watch it though
Holy shit i didn't know he had it in him. He's fucking amazing.
I love Bob, but how many "retired bad guy, gone good, goes back into the game again" movies do we need
I'M STRONG! LIKE THE HULK! Anyone?
Damnn this actually looks good. John Wick mixed with The Equalizer = Nobody.
would be cool if this is in the same universe as john wick, just another hitman returning to his job in the underworld
Filmed in Winnipeg
John wick‘s dad
I said a lot of things back in 1999...what I never said was "22 years from now, one of the dorks from Mr. Show will one day play a bad-ass killing machine in an action movie."
looks amazing!!!
He was a colleague of John Wick in school!!!
Must work at Cinnabon
Not gonna lie. This actually looks pretty fucking awesome.
Where's Walter White?
saul goodman inspired by walter white
john wick aftre 50 years old missing old days lol .......
So he's John Wick's father.
Please let this guy be in John Wick's universe
"NEVER UNDERESTIMATE  A NOBODY"
I wonder if they are going to finish better call Saul
This will turn out to be a movie set in a John Wick universe, just like Split turned out to be part of Unbreakable universe. Mark my words!
Is this Mike at 0:41?
Remember viggo's son asking about nobody in jhon wick 1 , I think so this is that nobody
Generic John wick
So basically this is john wick version of kitty cat bracelet and a family
if john wick was a family man the movie
"In theaters only"  That way they only had to make the trailer
Saul Breaks bad 😂
Better call Saul
I cannot be the only person who considers this a SEVERE miscast
El tío Saul esta de regresoooooo!!!🔥🔥🔥 "No Walt, yo soy el peligro"
Finally John wick have family and gett old...😁
In theaters only? Who even goes to theaters any more? I'll stream it for free
A History of Violence, John Wick, and my personal favourite Equalizer - let's hope it doesn't disappoint
why i kinda love the movies which have an angry dude who kills mob.
Better Call... Nobody?
Well this is just dad on a John Wick Costume
Feels awesome
IN THEATRES ONLY....       Me: Wasn't gonna skip it in cinemas in the first place...
dont call 911 but when you are in danger  "Better call Saul"
I am so happy for him that he got this kinda of recognition in the movie industry 🔥
What's the name of the song running in the background???
Wow cool. But it looks like Wick's spin off then one day they'll be in JW 5
So *Hollywood's becoming Bollywood*
Well, nobody in pennsylvania can watch this
РУССКИЕ ТУТ
Is this related to mr nobody from fast & furious 🤨🧐
John and hutch sitting in a  bar  Hutch : so why the fuck this shit happened to u ?  John : well they killed my dog, hbu ? Hutch : well they took  away my daughter's hello kitty  braclet... John : oh......
In theatres ONLY - FEB 26th.........LOL
Spoiler  . . . . . This movie is based on John Wick(In parallel universe  where he grows old with his family)
Anyone know that music at 1:13 ?
A tata mówił skończ szkołę prawniczą gdyby nie to tak wyglądałby alternatywny świat...
whatta ride
Saul is doing some good action
Saul Wick
looks boring as hell
It look like spin-off of equaliser 🤫🤫
Sal has been broken
What if this is a spin off to show who will be teaming up with John wick to face the high table.
That's the Saul I wanted to call👍👍👍
Old Man Wick. I love it
Me myself and Irene
Thats John Wick
Better see it quick, it’s “only” in theatres for one day (February 26)
Паль и Серебряков? Серьезно?!
There is a little bit of nobody in your Jhon wick
Looks like jhon wick
-U've problems with the law? -Better call saul!!!
Anyone please give link for BGM
Why the fuck this feels like a new liam neeson movie without liam neeson?
Saul Badman
Better call Saul.. litrally 😄
Another typical action movie, a copy of everything, l like Saul Goodman but i already know the storyline...
John wick rip off with stolen dailouge: " never underestimate power of a common man"
This is what you get from studios who made ........ John Wick 😎
John Wick of alternate universe
Covid will not stop me from seeing this movie
When Average Joe becomes John Wick
Green Lantern: Look, whatever he is, he's sure not in the same league as Grundy and the others. He's a nobody. Batman: Ever read the Odyssey? After Odysseus was caught by the cyclops, he told it his name was "Nobody". So when he poked its eye out and its friends asked who did it, all the cyclops could say was "nobody". Green Lantern: Point taken.
I'd love to see nobody and John wick characters in the same universe 🔥
Does anyone know the name of the background song?
No need to go watch it I've seen the whole movie already from this trailer!
Did anyone really believed that was an official universal pictures production
So, john wick?
Did not see this coming...
John Wick...is that you!!!
Omg!!! It's better call Soul!!!!!
*Don't mess with Jimmy Mcgill*
Whoa.
ohh Jimmy ❤️
Are we getting a wick cinematic universe?
Train fight 😍 Wait What was the Background song is that 😍😍😍😍😍.
😍😍😍Wow wow wow This is how a Trailer Should be 😍😍😍.
That's John Wick father?
wrong guy for this character !!!
Feels like a shit , this person almost all parts identical to me except the changes he done for his betterment of life
Saul Goodman as John Wick? Please ...
Nobody ( John wick 4)
since when Saul know how to throw a punch lol?
Odenkirk got cooler as he got old!
This fuckin 'NOBODY' is JOHN WICK
I don’t know WTF is this i only know that You’re my saul goodman Just call saul 😍😍
John "If the wife didn't die and they had stupid kids and he had a mid life crisis" wick
Thank God he is also a good lawyer.
“In theaters only”... we will see about that...
Wicked! Track ...Even wickeder
Saul goodman
It’s the John wick 2 poster with fists instead of guns *Nice*
Looks like artillery Arthur lost it when Tugboat died.
waiting nobody 😉
John Wick with his family alive.
“Better call saul”
Whole movie in 3 minutes
That actually looks nice
If you are asking who wants to watch this movie   Just read the title
Better call Saul
Can i get new chapter of John Wick every year?
Better call soul.
Janky Wick
Now that looks like a fun movie.
They should have used the song nobody by John bobla
1:43 You picked the wrong house fool
Saul Goodman sure changed.
Nobody gonna fuck you up in the theater.
mr . white : i am the guy who knocks jimmy: oh!really iam the guys who keeps the guys to the sleep
John wick has a brother?
Luke from gillmore girls is getting old!!!
Earlier it was a doggy now it's a Kitty.
He is the one who knocks.
where did that leftist shrill find all those white guys on a bus to beat up.
*Better call Saul*
So, basically John Wick 4 :) Loved the trailer...hit like when he fisted wall!! Scene game me goosebumps.
It's one hell of a trailer
I'll just watch John Wick again instead. Seems like it's the same film with rehashed action sequences and a minor plot change.
Awesome. I love this guy.
FUCK YEAH BOB ODENKIRK DESERVES THIS MOVIE
Ill make a bet with them. If theyre ACTUALLY able to shoe their movies in theaters by February, ill pay cash and bring friends.
This is promising
I love Bob Odenkirk but he never been athletic person. So, what I see in close combat is he needs to train more martial arts and exercise. You are free to say anything but don't get me wrong. Just after one character based john wick and joker movies, Bob's first innovative work should be more realistic. It seems so fake that Bob beating four young and strong kids.
100% guaranteed to be in theatres February 26
I was thinking about a movie plot like that & I named that Nobody. What a miracle
Why the poster looks like john wick?
Better call Saul Whick
Lol, a parody movie😂
I haven't even seen the trailer, but the traditions dictate that I must do this.  Nobody:  Edgy Insta Posts:  Never underestimate a nobody.
is this the trailer to badass3 ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo__aCCWOlE
Its all good man!
Theatres only of february... Guess who will see this movie? Noboby :)
john wick vs nobody
that guy looks familiar...
Better call Saul
Joker meets Fight Club. How lame?
Say my Name: NOBODY!!!
Another power fantasy for soyboys XD
Thought it was Saul
They gave a away too much in the trailer.
"Don't piss-off Saul"
Ok... so John wick meets... the rest of this comment doesn’t matter.
So now we're just remaking John Wick? Pass.
When you buy john wick movie on wish:
What's a.... theater?
It's John Wick, but with Bob Odenkirk... What's not to love?
Damn!
Humble family man turns out to be a professional assassin, the past catches up to him and now he kicks everyone's ass. Definition of cliche. Is this the only type of movies that sell?
Better call saul if you commit a crime
It looks like he said if Mike can do it, why shouldn't I?
so john wick
Director- so this is the film i have to direct  ? Who wrote this ?  Producer - "Nobody"
For the final fight...John Wick vs boogeyman nobody
Looks promising👏
Nobody: Literally Nobody: Nobody:
Another John Wick *sigh*
SPIN OF JONN WEAK 😂 😂 😂 😂
Sentinel?
Goosebumps overloaded... Waiting..
2:26
Is it me or this movie has no personality?
John nobody
Saul after retirement
Billiger John Wick Abklatsch mit einem total schlechten Schauspieler !!!!!!
во-первых, я не понял когда это Сол Гудман стал Джоном Уиком... а во-вторых, Паль? Серебряков? опять русская мафия? якудза, триада уже не в моде?)) а ямайцы не толерантно?  ну-ну))
"But isn't this John Wick?" Director: No, this guy got a family
Saul goodman from a lawyer to John wick
Family version of John Wick
Holllly mamaaaa this shit its so crazy
When jhon wick starts a family be like.
Ohh I see from the producer of john wick ohhhh
im pumped
Saul wick; it’s condescending that they can recycle this garbage with no change and still expect me to watch it, but I will anyway
By the thumbnail i thought this was going to be a John Wick parody
Joker 2
Joker 2
*Whole movie is in the 3 min trailer*  People At Theater: Why is Nobody here?
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUd1ZwbYnyi2-Kv4bsHqiw
Gimme that kitty cat bracelet 😂😂
Well If he fucked up then he better call Saul
From the makers of John Wick, it's John Wick: but instead of Keanu Reeves... It's this guy
I think the train scene was quite similar to joker movie.
Don’t call 911, you better call Saul!
Should have only showed half the trailer, nothing is left to the imagination any more.
Udin
I'd better call Saul
New jhon wick
Son of John Wick
all right guys you just watched the whole movie
a "MILD MANNERED AVERAGE" John Wick
It's All Good Man
It'll be epic if this is on the same universe as john wick
Let’s say I know a guy , who knows a guy and that’s Saul Goodman who is a good badman now.
I m also Nobody😂😂😂😂😂
In theaters only... 26th feb.. I can understand.. Bt in which year.. ??
John wick vs Mr nobody
A John Wick clone in theaters only during COVID season? Mmmmmmmhhhhhhh
Awsome
John Wick but with a cat
If he got in trouble  He better call Saul
Just call Baba Yaga
"that fucking nobody is not john wick" -russian mob leader
Saul meets john wick?
Cool
"Don't call 911" "Then whom should we call?" *"Call theatre, book the ticket cuz we rollin' "*
Saul is finally had enough with law and kartel bullshit.
I'm nobody but I can kick your ass
*Nobody.. but he's ONE MAN ARMY*
I can't tell if this is a serious movie or a parody
Better Call Maul
Are you Super man 😂 ? Nope, i am Mr wick in old version 😂😂😂👍
2:36 Triple Headshot !
Better Call Saul next season looks different
He may not be as focused as John Wick, and didn't kill people with a pencil.
Should Better call Saul b4 investigation
Looks generic af
So this was Saul's new dust filter for his Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro model 60
He is 2 years older than Keanu Reeves..
BETTER CALL NOBODY
Белый адвокат таки выжил и переехал в Америку.
What the fuck was that song ? Damnnnnnnnnn
It's going to be mine be t birthday ever
Паль что ли? 0:55

Nobody does it better

solid trailer i love it❤️
He look like John wick but have good marriage
John Wick... but elder.
First half of the trailer..I thought he's is not going to fire any of the bullet in the whole movie.
So... History of Violence meets John Wick?
in theaters only february 26th i like your optimism!
So this is Saul Goodman do after breaking bad
This is set in the John wick universe it's so painfully obvious 🙄
John wick if his wife didnt die
Tugboat is gone!!
F****** a** hole trailer I want to watch this movie.....
So another f++ing nobody? Nice
They should’ve added his dog Tugboat.
From now he's not Saul Goodman he is Saul badassman😎
John Prick
So this is what happens when John Wick's wife dont die.
Why aren’t they wearing masks????
Nobody:
John wick family edition
A badass daddy movie
Saul Bad Man.
Il veulent encore te faire croire qu'avec tes poing ✊ tu évite des rafales de cartouches qui arrivent a 1200 km/h bravo hollywoode....mais la vraie vie c'est pas ça malheureusement.
Remember when there was the Twilight/Hunger Games frenzy and a lot of generic young-adult movies started to come out to have a piece of the box-office cake? Well, this looks exactly one of those generic uninspired movies, but related to the John Wick success. A shame that Bob Odenkirk wasn't cast for something just a little more imaginative and original.
Name of the song at 1:12..?
كم هذا مشوق على طريقة جون ويك
0:05 bad boys song
He should better call Saul.
If this nobody and baba yaga meets up, oh man its gonna be a massacre
Mike Ehrmantraut 😍
Seems like the copy of john wick...
Better call jhon wick
Why this dude reminds me Max Payne 🤔 !?
I'm hype because Bob Odendirk is a superb actor
Will he do next season of betrer call saul ?
Better call Nobody
So... John Wick without the dead wife and dog?
Its like John wick 😂
Что русские Актёры Оо
John started killing everyone for a dog  Nobody starts killing everyone for a goddamn kitty-cat bracelet
A man is finally a nobody influenced by the faceless gods of Braavos ... I hope there would be a cameo of Jaquen H'gar as well😁
Knock knock  Who’s there?  Nobody  Oh S***!
Sault went form  smart to badass in 1 easy step.
i got john wick vibes here .
If John Wick and Equalizer had a baby
So🙄  John wick becomes nobody....  in old age
Good Goooooood (with Palpatine voice)

Imagine him going after john wick in john wick 4
Fuck yeaaah!!!!
Sol! What happened to you!??
Every introverts dream.
Will this be on netflix?
Is that our soul good man 🙌
🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎Voice with THE MASS🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Yeeeeeeeeesssss!
End of Salamanca's 🔥
So they made thumbnail similar to John Wick 2’s poster with  hands instead of guns. Lol
John wick vibes
After this movie, I'm waiting for a crossover with John Wick.
This is the boogeyman John Wick was sent to kill.........#Baba_Yaga
"Better call saul..."  Who is here after it
Nice to see Kevin Costner doing action movies again :3
better call saul was SUCH a disappointment....im just gonna pass.....
He had me on the Kitty Cat Bracelet!🤣
He's gonna be working at a cinabun by the end of the movie
0:55 - there's the guy who played in Leningrad - Voyage. Also directed by Ilya
reading comments -its just more interesting - than watching this trailer!
You are not "Nobody"! You are Saul goodman! 🤙🏻
John wick parody
Saul Wick

WALMART Jhon Wick has entered the building
The Old John Wick😎😁 The copy trademark Home dark fight scene ofJohn Wick
well, better call Saul I guess...
I know a guy who knows The Guy....
"Give me the God damn kitty cat bracelet!!!!" It's like John wick's opposite. With family and instead of a dog they got a cat. And instead of assassin, he's a auditor. Nice
RIP lalo 😂😂😂
Netflix or Prime in Q4 2021
If we don't get someone to knock on his door in a suit or even a call of John wick ill be so sad
Next RAMBO
i laughed and i loved
Why am I hearing General Aladeen at 1.13
from the Producer of John Wick:  "They took my kitty cat"  Ah shit, here we go again..
This is Dad wick hahaha
is this before or after he defecated through a sunroof?
Is it the same universe as John Wick? If it is, I'm looking forward for a cross-over between the two.
Slippin Jimmy...
same dude from hardcore henry. it will be a great movie.
Threat Level Midnight
Ehrmentraut would be proud.
He is the real 'Boogeyman'. That John Wick was sent to kill. But he lets him go & faked his death. That's where Wick got the idea of starting a family & living a quiet life.
"All of this, for a kitty bracelet?"
I hope this is in the same universe as  John wick and Anna
Oh look, John Wick seems to be a hit? Lets copy that!
Historians will write that it all started because they stole his daughter's "Kitty Cat Bracelet".
If john wick had a family
from the directors of john wick  me: i'm definitely watching this
why only theaters bruh its corona times
john wick wannabe
Saul Fucking Goodman!!!
when you're in danger better call nobody..
The movie should have been named Saul Wick
Ok cool so this would have been John wick if his wife didn’t die .........dope😎😎
It's just John Wick with extra family drama.
Better Call Nobody
john week
I thought movie is going to be on Saul Goodman😂
three heads shot nice
Basically John wick reboot
from Slipping Jimmy,  James MacGil,  Saul GoodMan,  well Shank it!  i'm Nobody!
-GODDAMMKITTYCATBRACLET-
John wick: i need my personal lawyer  Police: and who is that? Saul goodman:
The title of the movie should be " John Wick: Midlife Crisis"!
This dude looks like Keano Reeves Retired
The actor replicated keanu reeves
Don't Call 911 *Better Call Saul*
Better call nobody
That fucking pointblank 3 for 1 was ridiculous
John Wick: “they killed my dog”  Nobody: “they stole my daughter’s kitty cat bracelet”
I'm down. This looks fun
Osm baby
I think this is going to take place in John Wick's timeline,if it makes slightest sense.
john wick: Finally a good competitor
Probably the dad of John wick 😁
NOOO NOT THE KITTY CAT BRACELET!!
2:38 wow triple kill
Better call nobody
John Wick Lite
John Wicks Brother Jimmy Wick.
Fkkin hell yaa,,its like POLAR
theaters Close ;) stream it online
Nobody: You don't want a criminal lawyer, you want a *criminal* lawyer
What about "Better Call Saul"??
@00:29 Bob Odenkirk seems to have a strong relation with Coffee Mugs...
There's some serious Naked Gun/Hot Shots vibes from this and I fucking love it.
This is literally the same movie than john wick.... I mean literally: A guy who worked for mafias almost half of his life the retires and hi sees his self inside his old life because some troublemakers entered in his home
When the text came out as from the makers of John Wick , I read it as from the makers of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul...
Kinda upset that the soundtrack is not nobody by Mitski
This is John wick WFT?
Better call Saul
Честно говоря обидно что наши актеры в западных проектах не могут в силу особенностей рынка выйти из амплуа "русского бандита", но тем не менее, надеюсь Александр Паль и Алексей Серебряков если смогут, построят достойные карьеры на западном атерском рынке.
Yaa i am father  of the John  wick..
No body: No body:
They have my fav russian actor serebryakov this is awesome
Dad: am nobody John wick: We should dance sometime
Every body saying John wick spin off. It's actually a spin off of Wu Xia a Chinese Donnie Yen's movie.
The moment jimmy became saul
When I first saw the title. I thought he is Mr. Nobody from Fast & Furious. Maybe???
here for Saul Goodman jokes :x
A goddamn kitty cat
They literally just showed the whole movie.
We got nobody who can compete with john wick
0:41 I feel safe when Mike's here.
Damn saul
Looks absolutely outstanding... Actions are pure...
DEATHWISH ALL OVER AGAIN STOP STEALING OLD FILMS WRITE SOMETHING NEW JEEEEEEESE
Lawyer Saul is now nobody 😁
John weak
Better not call saul
Imagine John Wick himself decked in all black comes out in a background frame, then Nobody guy goes "Hey! Get back in your own movie universe, this one's mine .."
Wow amazing 🙏👍
Masssssss🔥
THAT FUCKING NOBODY.
You better call Saul nobody 😁
Now I've seen the trailer I feel like I've seen the whole movie.
Soul Goodman has seen has seen enough bullshit of everyone.💪🏽😡🖕
John wick inspired....????
Already seen it... John wick
This looks like the Equalizer
gypsy crusader
Why was he angry? Did they kill his dog?  p.s.:From a Russian director who watched John Wick
“From the producer of John Wick”. Yeah that checks out.
viggo's son was telling about fucking nobody. And viggo misinterpreted it as john wick.
Give me the fucking kitty cat bracelet 😂
same universe with John Wick?
As there are any theaters left. lol  Looking forward to streaming it.
What of John wick's wife didn't die and he grew old?
John Wick 2077
He better call Saul after this
The Trailer Looks Solid ngl
О...Серебряков) Прикольно
Its saul after he quit new mexico
Jimmmyyyyyy..........🔥
1:30  Your wife will not call the 911 but your neighbour will.
Fucking awesome
so......john wick except, not?  looks kinda interesting
"in theatres only" bold are we considering there's a Fucking pandemic going on
Awesomemovie, can't wait to see it full.   ^^
Is this like the next john wick
Nobody: Literally nobody: . . . . Universal Pictures: Nobody
This almost looked good until they changed the plotline to a cliche one.
I love that kitty cat...😸
John Wick: "You killed my dog!" Hutch: "Give me the goddamn kittycat bracelet!"
Although it looks good, I think they've revealed too much of the plot. Personally, I think it would have been better if they framed the trailer as if he was a "nobody" who just had enough of been walked on over his entire life, finally flips and then he becomes a vigilante. If they'd had done that, I wouldn't have seen the twist half way through the movie.  With what I've seen in this trailer though, I now know exactly how the story goes, and as a result, I've got a pretty good idea how it'll end too.
When you realize that your Dad is Nobody 😂 and kills violent men like Max Payne 🤔
Looks awesome!!
First it was a dog now a kitty cat🤣🤣
Sooo this "mr nobody" life before meet with dom.
If I'm not wrong is this the back story of Mr nobody from f and f
So he change his identity twice
You involved in slme criminal activity, BETTER CALL SAUL. You want to do some big criminal offence, BETTER CALL SAUL again
Jimmy is everyones favorite 😍 😍
2:37 is that a no scope triple kill?
So this is John Wicks brother
I feel that this is connected to jhon wicks universe
That's my type of film
Song name please?
" I am lawyer of the one who knocks " 🔥
I'm friend of Jhon wick 😁😁😁
So when is it coming to Netflix then?
It's fabulous to see saul in action. Incredible. He nailed it.
Wait.. that isn't Kim Wexler
I know that everybody thinks that its John Wick clone, BUT - 2 things make me think, that it's actually - same universe: producers name and this shot of box with golden bars. This is literally screaming - "this John Wick spinoff!" 🤔
just one word > fantastic
This looks like a spoof trailer of John Wick.
BOBBY!!!
Jhon wick + jason statham
dont see him as an action star
John wick: The Suberbs
Better call Saul
2:37  *OOH* *BABY* *A* *TRIPLE*
What we are minding, but not what we could...
looks kinda cool, but also like a john wick rip off.
THE KITTY CAT
Nobody is perfect, I mean this is just a perfect nobody.
Its like John Wick .... but older
Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God's name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized.

So, it's a comedy?
So this is john wick with wife
Everyone: it’s Soul Goodman
A mixture of John Wick and The Equalizer
Its john wick in a timeline where his wife didn't die and decided to have a family
!!
The fist few seconds I thought it was goin to be a story about what happens when you realize you arent a hero .   Nope just another Jonh wick rehash .
Saul Goodman ain't a good man no more
Jimmy you've changed a lot man
Never thought Saul would be like this 😂
seems like combination of john wick and breaking bad

SAULLL GOODDDMANNNNN
Wow! I really enjoyed this 3 minute movie. 10/10
Better Call Saul

My sipdey sense feels there's a franchise coming up 🤔🤔
John wick with family
John Wick + Saul Goodman + Breaking Bad = Nobody
Odenkirk is great
Better call Saul X John Wick
This lolls like a spin off of John Wick?!? Or John Wick was too busy acting for Cyberpunk 2077 they just hired this dude lol still looks like a great film though but would definitely be an ideal role for Keanu Reeves
Jimmy "Saul Goodmen" McGill
John Wick 4 looks wired.
The Ultimate 'Feel Good' (for Men) movie lol.
Better call Saul goes John Wick.
Hey! Call to Saul!
Need someone Audited.  Better Call Saul.
I really enjoyed to see  the whole movie
Better should have called Sal
John Wick without the losing wife/dog/car story.
'BETTER CALL NOBODY'
John Wick - Light
First a dog now a kitten 😂
Gutted it’s theatre only. Cinema is dead to me now.

wish jhon would join him...😁
Don't call 911 .. better call saul
I would for him and John Wick to team up (Wicks still sounds better to me) if someone stole money for charity for animals and children.
fight  over a dog now a kitty cat bracelet  ..hoolywood
This is mixed of John wick  somehow
Confidence level : I'm nobody
I am really scared for Salamancas now !!
Definitely going to watch fdfs ⚡🔥

Don't call 911... Better call Saul!
I thought it better to call Saul
It’s like they saw John Wick and were like “yeah let’s do that but take out all the parts that everybody likes and make it really generic”
Him: Don't call 911   Nobody: Better call Saul then?
Joker + John Wick :))
Damn he jus brought a whole new meaning to his nickname “Artillery Arthur”
In theaters only!!???? TF man!
It's John wick with a family who gets old
Nobody is to John Wick like  Narnia is to Lord of the Rings
He has evolved alot from the breaking bad.
John Wick but not
is this a ripoff of john wick ?
John wick - Dog Nobody- Kitty cat
Cant wait for this new Jhon Wick movie
Better call Saul ☎️
The alternative John Wick timeline
I LOVE IT!   .. except for the '' theatres only '' part.
Discount John Wick. I like Bob but he is just the wrong choice for that character...
Me...I'm John Wick.
......In theaters?.....How?
Nobody exists; John Wick: Finally a worthy opponent.
This look lit af
I am planning to watch BETTER CALL SAUL, is it worthy guyss?
"In Theaters Only"  Covid-19 : Im still here  HBO MAX : You can watch safety 😂😂
Nobody: Nobody:
Reminds of me John Wick...
1:00 From that point on - the whole movie is a short fantasy inside his head, in reality hes been killed by those thugs in the bus. ^
So... this is what john wick is if he has a family. 😅
This is the exact moment when Saul Goodman becomes Mike Ehrmantraut.
Soundtrack name pls
nobody does it better.
John WIck's uncle ?
Damn i haven't seen such a well crafted action movie trailer in a long fucking time son😍
saul keeps getting more badass
"Give me the goddamn kitty kat bracelet!!!"  Said NOBODY

Паль - красавчик
New name suggestion: What if john wick had a family !?
See the likes ratio
John Wick Universe
Used to be the guy who knows a guy that knows another guy who is a very cautious man. But now hes just nobody..
Looks like low budget John Wick!
So, you made a funny remake of « A History of Violence » right ?
Главный антагонист Серебряков? Это будет занятно

The alternate reality where John Wick's wife didnt die

Excited to see saul Goodman.
John Wick was about Dog...  Nobody is about Kitty Cat...😁😁😁
He’ll be representing himself in court. He knows all the laws
Nobody !! Nobody !! Does it better !!
This popped up as an ad on another video. Watched it all the way through and cpuld not for the life of me figure out who the guy was but he looked so familiar. Look it up and it's fucking Saul! Holy shit.
Ares: Be seeing you. NOBODY. Nobody: Not if I see you FIRST.

Bob Odenkirk is amazing actor especially after better call saul. He deserves for more movies/tv shows where he play as main character.

Dont call 911   Better call saul

It reminds of " Who the fucking nobody !! " - Babayaga 🔥
Did he call Saul after fucking all of them?
Baba yaga with a family
Don't care. I'll still watch this.
Being bullied? Better Call Saul

Goodman becomes Badman.....
So this is saul's breaking bad? Noizz
YUP.

Don't call 911. Better call SAUL.
*It's all good man*
Some random dude no ones ever seen is playing the main character of an action movie...? Mhhmm. Ill pass on this one lol.
literally just watched the whole movie in that trailer.
I know a guy and he knows a guy who knows nobody...  Confused?? Well you better call Saul
Just say this is a spin-off of John Wick coz it would be nice to see the whole lore again in a different perspective.
1:35 look at that little girls eye she knew her dad was badass all along
So John wick got competition
The Odenkirk has reached apogee, prepare for greatness!
Saul really taking it to the next level.. Walt would have been proud.. and Jesse too
better call Паль
You know when they say the movie title in the trailer its a good film
Bob fucking Odenkirk!!! This man was at a time was expected to be Michael Scott.... Damn  Threat level midnight coming true.
Nobody: Nobody:
John wick : Puppy Nobody : Kitycat bracelet
That looks sick.
this movie is basically   "call the ambulance, but not for me"
"Hey John, you working tonight?"
i came all the way to the trailer to say this movie looks extremely boring
Its wierd to see him grow older...
Yeah, no... I can’t unsee him as Saul Goodman.
John Wick Universe
uchiha obito : i'm nobody and i dont want to be anybody
I mean. What’s the damn song used in this trailer? 😂 Honestly it pieces it together perfectly. I need it in muh life.
Jhon wick's daddy 😂
Gonna watch this only to hear Odenkirk's voice
This is the version where John Wick has a family to protect. There is one thing that doesn't change, that is Headshots 😂😂
wtf    i think john wick and this will be the boss of fuking action movies
When John Wick and Saul Goodman makes a baby together...***
Wow!great movie. im waiting YTS.
John Wick: you killed my dog Nobody: you stole my kitty cat bracelet
So this is what happened to Saul
Director-"In theatres Only" Torrent/Telegram- "We will see"
Кто тоже заметил Серебрякова?
I wonder if this is in the John wick universe.
"Falling down" took a whole new turn.
I'm.. Gone.. Fuck u.... In.. Theaters...
at 1st i thought its bruce willis'john mcclane. turn out its john wick older brother. lol
thought new sault goodman series =(
Lmfao I fucking hate this. Let's play off the Suburban dad with a gun fetish looking for a reason to hurt people and let them imagine their dreams came true. Don't Empower these cuntz.
Imagine if John wick and this guy team up.
Saul Wick .   Looks great
And he's a damn good lawyer
I legit thought it was nobody meme. Like-  Nobody: Official trailer be like:
Nobody will watch it in theaters.
Is this Jeff Wick?
My man went from 'better call saul' to 'saul wick'
Bob Odenkirk? Check!  ..and that's all the requirements met!
Thought Saul would become Paul. But he became John instead.
He's a long lost brother of John Wick.
What if i told you its set in john wick universe!
I thought Saul went to work at a Cinnabon store?
Could this be in John Wick's universe?
So a comedic John Wick?
Lol everybody ready to go at it in 2020
No body huh
shit Saul, walter really mesed you up
So this is john wick if he would have been able to start a family with his wife... cool, i’m in
kevin costner be looking good these days
Перебежчик Серебряков начал в убогих киношках сниматься. Ожидаемо
Anyone catch the wexler McGill mug???
This is literally joker but weird and more weird
Nobody:  Official trailer:
Funny how Bryan Cranston and Bob Odenkirk have pretty much swapped the type of roles they played in breaking bad
Don't call 911, love it.
Bob odenkirk? Say less...sign me up!
John Wick changed his face and identity and have a family..
A classmate of John Wick. He seems extra sensitive about Kitty Cat bracelet,  Jus like John WIck🐶
Who the fuck are you?  Better Call Saul!!
I honestly thought the actor was Jack Earle Haley (Rorschach) from the film Watchmen..
https://www.theepochtimes.com/2020-election-investigation-who-is-stealing-america_3617562.html?utm_source=share-btn-copylink&st=ElKwAXZ-_QWdaSrxTCb8LNRgi13pnpPVngH361sKEQU5B_KPvq0sj4BDyqFhCcW__qnZKztrZOV-Xfh-Iq6btQOxa2LaGvDRZQU                             please share.
damn 1 shot, 3 kills.
Jimmy McGill went full Mike Ehrmantraut
If John Wick had a baby 🔥 🔥 🔥..
Seriously, Serebryakov is a Russian bandit? Again.
Looks like Spin-off of John Wick
john wick  5
john wick with a lot more cheese
This John Wick if he had a living family
Looks like John wick got a brother😂😂😂😎😎😎👍👍👍
John Wick meets Taken...
Goodman
*Everybody gangsta till John wick tells you about his family*
I knew it being a lawyer was too hard on him😐😐😐
Cool! A movie about John Wicks dad! Great prequel
John Wick Pre-4 !!!
"It's all Good Man!!"
The alternate universe where Jimmy McGill trained alongside Ted Theodore Logan.
Nobody, i'm a nobody I'm a tramp, a bum, a hobo I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine And a straight razor ...if you get too close to me
Ok this is definitely in the John Wick universe, right?
Thumbnail = Me  And Trailer = John wick kind of thing  (? ?????)
John Wick = Nobody. According to Viggo's Son
https://youtu.be/0co0XTnvnck
Better call an ambulance... But not for me
Now I can be sure Lalo gonna be super dead
Somewhere else in John wick's world
John wick's father
The Irish Bruce Willis.
Ayyappanum koshiyum
John Wick with a little touch of the Accountant. this is nice.
hoo i see i see they will sure do crossover  nobody and john wick
In theaters only nobody can watch at home 😂
this is john wick if he has a family
The song for this trailer should've been Nobody by Warbeast https://youtu.be/Z58tHaPIfvA lyrics: No rules ever obeyed You'll soon feel my rage I'm ready to engage! You wanna mess with me? Then you'll need an army You better bring it on Cause I'm an army of one!  Nobody gets in my way Nobody dares defy me Nobody lives to tell about it Nobody disrespects me... Insults me... Can beat me... Will defeat me!  You say you're filled with hate Then I accept your fate You have ignored my warning Now the storm is coming! You wanna make your mark  I'm waiting in the dark For you to take that step A move you'll always regret!  You should have listened They tried to warn you But you ignored them And now they mourn you!  Your corpse a message To fools who follow If they are wiser They'll see tomorrow!  You're not the first to try You're just the next to die! Power flows through my veins Life exits your remains  You should have walked away Held your demise at bay Your life would've been spared But now your death's been declared!
I’ll still wait until it hits iTunes.
1:22 definitely Jesse and Walter
- What's your name? - Hutch 'Danger' 'Mansell
Dam looks like that lawyer went all out
Don't call 911. Better call saul.
We better call Saul.
Is this another Saul Goodman Production?
"Better Call Saul" just become badass...
I can't wait to watch this
I really hope this is connected to the John Wick universe.
So what is this, Better Call Saul meets John Wick?
Nobody:  literally  Nobody:  Universal Pictures releasing : Nobody
Oh wow. Can't wait!
Ski from john wick
Don't call 911 . . . Better call Saul
John Wick's dog eats the kitty cat bracelet at a dog park. Not seeing the dog's owner around, Nobody takes the dog and waits for it to crap it out. John Wick goes after Nobody because he thinks he's trying to steal the dog. Nobody protects himself (and the dog) thinking it's just another assassin from his old employer trying to get revenge. Both guys stalemate each other and all the real bad guys die to collateral damage.
Who wants a John Wick cameo in this movie? It'll be like a John Wick cinematic universe 😎😎💯💯
@UP it looks we are out of corona now... universe is back... nice one... police needs to be serious with business so much crime. Evil needs evil end
bruh, i love bob odenkirk but this is a john wick rip off down to the last retired murderer, muscle car driver lmao
Saul Goodman
Nobody resembles Varathan of Mollywood....  Varathan resembles Straw Dogs of Hollywood....  😶
The break-in reminded me of Michael's Meltdown in GTA V. Looking forward to this flick!
-Sr.Wick? -No, he's busy...  but I'll tell you what... better call Saul.
Varathan + John Wick
Nobody:
Better call nobody...
John Wick Universe!
family man john wick hypeee
Odenkirk gets a Wick movie? Im down
Netflix buy this
Damn this looks good
JIMMY!!!
omg this looks epic!,  Jimmy I mean Bobby is such a great actor, can't wait for it! xD
Who the f*** are you i'm nobody .....saul back in action.
Man and I thought it was unjust what people did for a dog.
They should better call Saul :)
Song
Saul Wick
wonderful~😍👍❤
Should be titled , John Wick : Family Edition  Thumbs up if you agree !!!
He's John Wick's father
I can see mr. nobody on john wicks universe.
If John wick and the equalizer had a missing cousin
When John wick gets old 😂
Better Bryan Cranston join also for deadly duo!
It's all good Man 🔥
This looks so awesome
Better NOT call Saul, I am all in on this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
they say because of hero，there are villians，but there are always some bad people and some good people，stand out or not is the problem. If heros stand out and they really act like Superman，Batman，Flash，those who give up their own life to create hope，then whatever kind of villian comes out it is not their fault， they only created hope，living with knowing there are bad people around the world is the reality， but knowing there is hope，that worth everything.
Thats cool but why recycle the john wick coming back from retirement idea?wtf guys.
oh saul here 😀
From: 'he killed my dog' to 'give me the fucking kitty cat'.... And as usual he is fucking 'nobody!' just like viggo's son said 😂
Awesome!
Saul goodman after meeting walter white
Fuck Yeah!
So it’s John wick with a more charismatic protagonist
Discount John wick looks good
I love this movie.
Best lawyer on the planet
That nobody is the new John Wick.....
Watch this be a Bad Boy marketing strategy.
Imagine if this actually does take place in the John Wick universe.
Better call nobody 😃
The harmony of the fight with the music👌👌
It looks like a john wick remake
"Don't call 911" "Then whom should we call? " "Mike Ehrmantraut"
Who wants this guy to collaborate with John Wick, please raise your hands?
Awesome thrillers.just wow  But it seems like represents a bit of like kingsman. But hence he is nobody
Shaolin monks would use hundreds of methods to harden the body. These methods include things such as slapping water on cold days, punching walls to strengthen the fist, and banging their heads against a sandbag for hours to strengthen the skull.
All jokes aside, this movie looks interesting.  I would love to see slippin Jimmy  Kill people
so Saul Goodman is John Wick now? man I wanna watch this movie
John Wick : fcked up entire gang because his dog was killed Nobody : literally the same but for a kitty cat bracelet
Badass
Bruh this is literally John Wick with a different cast
I'd watch the hell out of this! :D good damn Saul goodman after breaking bad is something else
Saul is a changed man these days.. family man!
The bus scene was laughable ..
"In theatres only" You fucking wish
Is that saul goodman 😮
Powli eyy
Always start with the russian 🤣
I want pencils
It's John Saul....
Kevin Costner lookin good for his age...
I don't know why. But, "Give me the God damned kitty cat doll" really tickled me lol
Nobody must team up with John Wick!
Lalo shaking in his boots as we speak
i can see breaking bad jokes coming a mile away
I love this kind of action movies
Finally, John Wick's brother has come!
I feel bad that it's only in theaters, it actually looks pretty good
If nobody is after you, well... better call Saul!
Arya Stark wants to know your location!!
Better call John wick
Kinda looks like an alternate dimension of where John Wick’s wife doesn’t die
"Who the fuck are you?"  "me? I'm Good, i mean i'm So Good 'hmm", i'm Saul Goodman the best lowyer of Albuquerque"
Train scene reminded me  joker, What is the song in background.
Bob wick??? I like it.i know him from Ben stiller show and Mr show and tim and Eric awesome show.nobody has put in the time to get a starring feature picture like Bob has.its already a success.the job is getting the opportunity.
Hell yeah I’d love to watch Bob Odenkirk in action movies!!!
looks like a beatifuly action packed more comedic version of jhon wick
So, this guy is like john wick, but in the future, where his wife weren't dead and they finally had kids..
John wick as a family man dude I am lovin it
Movie looks great but NOBODY is going to watch it in theaters due to COVID.
0:52 jeezus, he beat the bricks off these mother f**kers!
It's like ..what if John wick have family ?
When did saul learn from mike?
Who are you? Mimir: I am nobody
What a punch 👊 😵
John Wick Senior.
damn .. he is too good.. Saul Goodman as a killing machine
Who the f-ck cares about originality? Nobody does.
If you live in Michigan "Nobody" will be able to go see it...
It's all good mannn!!
It’s Saul Goodman!
His voice like Clint Eastwood.
Broken Badly
Wow Saul and Mike from breaking bad in the same movie. Bad ass
Poster copied from Indian Tamil Language Movie Jalikattu👍
Liam Neeson: I have a very particular set of skills; skills that will punish you for stealing a role clearly meant for me.
Can't wait for.
Now that’s a movie I can look forward to.
Better call Saul, Movie looks good
Finally got his shot,  love this actor. 👍
Viggo: I'm not mad about what u did I'm mad about who you did it to  Yosef: who? That fucking nobody? Viggo that fucking nobody is john w- I mean Nobody
씹상남자이야기 구만
If John Wick's wife lived & did'nt die, this would be  John after 10-20 years.
Breaking Sal
Damn this is good.👌
Badass.Trailer...Probably the best thing I've watched in a long time... Bob Odenkirk vs Alain Moussi that was totally unexpected
Better call SAUL
John Wick meets Joker
John Wick Spin Off movies.. Better Call Saul.
Like John Wick but even more unrealistic.
I’m watching this
Fucking sick ✌️😍
A poor man's John Wick...is still John Wick
Saul's after breaking bad...
Wick : Hi  Nobody : Baba Yaga !  ~Twist~ Wick : Hi Father
Wow!!!
That FUCKING nobody, is John Wick
If "John Wick" and "Taken" would have a baby, "Nobody" would come up 👍
Give me the damn kitty cat bracelet!
IT'S A FU***N BLOCKBUSTER!
-Who the F*** are you? - I'm Saul Wickman
キチゲを開放せよ
Wait is this a knock off of John Wick
My God, this will be better than the Equalizer.
Bob I love you man
so, basically.. it's R.E.D, but alone..
This looks amazing
Looks like a movie written for Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington and not SolGoodMan.
0:40 is that Mike Ehrmantraut?
This is john wick.. With a wife.. And kids.. And a kitty instead of puppy.. And short hair.. This is the bright side of john wick.. John wick is the dark john wick.. U get what i mean? Damn..
1:24 Damn you product placement! Now I want a SIG rifle!
Can anyone help me with song name
It's all good, man
Nobody : Literally, nobody : This movie : nobody
Who's there behind my door ? Mr. Nobody : I'm Nobody from nowhere. . I have got nothing for you
Im sorry bob dont give me action movie vibes but im still gonna see this shit.
See kids.....this is what working a 9-5 will ultimately do to you

Comes out on my birthday
Look at the lil girls face 1:36
Já prevejo um crossover com John Wick🔥
This looks exactly like a John Wick spin-off
This is gonna be a great movie to watch!!
Дауж, так сделать трейлер. чтобы за 3 минуты посмотреть фильм нужно еще постараться
Ah yes John Wick with fists
Well at least that hit squad wore their facemasks.
Damn I watched half the tailor and feels like I watched the whole movie already like I honestly feel like i watched the best parts of the movie already..
Better calll me now 😀😀😀😀😀
I absolutely love that this is Bob Odenkirk. The last guy youd ever expect to be in a film like this.
That's John Wick's villan right there
That "fuckin' nobody"... is Nobody.
главное вовремя позвонить Солу Гудману!
Goldmines Telefilms and Aditya movies and filmindian and crazy 4 MOVIES ko subscribe ker legea
Saul isn't taking retirement very well
ugh, boring.
You better believe I’m down for my favorite lawyer kicking some ass for a kitty cat bracelet
Maybe they're going to interconnect this somehow to the John Wick universe. I just want to see more of the Continental hotel too
John Wick co worker?
So we had an Accountant and now we have an Auditor. Holly smokes!
Someone didn't call Saul
It was fine until it became another cookie cutter action flick.
John wick jokes aside. I love that they made him (despite being a ruthless fighter) he's also this old, boring family man.
Don't Call 911 , Call Saul .
Ditunggu nih film!
It will be good if this movie is part of John Wick universe
I have a feeling that the producer of this movie went to cast johny wick but since johny wick become mga star ⭐️ why would he work for small money 💰 his demand is more then ever now ..so producer of this movie thought I’m gonna cast my ancle jamal he will be fking nobody
That looks...kinda good.
Joker and John Wick vibes.
From the director behind Hardcore Henry!
Isnt that guy in thumbnail is the soul goodman of breaking bad?
This is just delaying Better Call Saul.
Finally good old action movies are back. I so tired from dat superheroic sh*t
I think this will be a good watch.
I don't even need to see the movie, the trailer has already delivered everything
I didn't even realize who that was until he said "You should see the other guy."
“You okay? You don’t look okay” “It’s Saul good man”
Saul Goodman is now a tough guy
FN BRILIANT
not gonna lie this looks dope
AWESOME!
Nice Challenger.
Beter call nobody
This is exactly how I feel in a lockdown
Cheers to all who grew up with My Name Is Nobody
“I need a new dust filter for my Hoover MaxExtract PressurePro model 60. Can you help me with that?”
Oh man this look good🤘
Finally Saul Strikes Back 😂
Given his previous line of work, ten bucks says that Hutch Mansell may have heard the name "Baba Yaga" somewhere.
Better call Saul Wick
Guess Saul broke bad
*10 years ago* Bob, someday you're going to be super famous and be the star in an action movie. Bob Odenkirk:  Lol
Don't call 911, better call Saul lol
Theaters only. Oh ok.
So if John Wick had a family
Im just a retired lawyer 😂
PTSC on steroids, that’s what happens when you are at the top of the apex predator food chain. Like a vampire that hasn’t fed in days, or when the Indians go off the reservation. It never ends well for anyone
why do i have a feeling of a john wick spinn off ?
I missed season 5 and now I have no idea what season 6 is about.
Just call saul
Lmfao this is literally John wick 🤦🏿‍♂️I'm still gonna see it but I mean c'mon Mr. John Wick producer you really couldn't come up with something slightly different? Even the name / concept is lifted from that scene in the first movie "who that F#%&ing nobody?!"
Nobody:  Official trailer:
I can tell from the kida this vould have easily become some wannabe john wick but from the trailer alone. This movie feel like its own thing despite the minor similarities. Im gonna enjoy this movie for sure
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Better call an ambulance
I don’t think they understand what a nobody is
Holy cow! It’s Kevin Costner!
Saul goodman goes god mode
Kevin McAllister  all grow’d up is just a nobody.
Damn he needa lawyer, better call Saul
You simply can`t justify not making a better call saul reference in your comment
Was this the trailer or the whole movie? Just asking for a friend.
Better Call Nobody
What's the song ?
Nobody is going to watch it........        I am nobody
Better than call Saul🔥
They have g36c’s in here! That’s pretty cool.
Those gold bars are definitely from John Wick. So now everyone wants cross overs i see...thank you Marvel
“For 12 years I worked for some very dangerous people” (Goliath National Bank)
If you want to defund the police you better have the same skills this guy has. No? Then STFU with your stupid demands!
i love this....!!!
Oh no, they didn't Call Saul!   December 14th, 2020
Saul Goodman kicks ass. I love it ❤️
So it's basically about the kitty cat bracelet instead of a dog this time.
Bob Wick
Ok, so what is that 'scat' part from 'Just a Gigolo' actually from, it's not from any of the David Lee Roth, Louis Armstrong, or Louis Prima.
Is that a Wexler McGill coffee mug?
Plot Twist: Nobody is John Cena's cousin
Looks like a good movie but at the 10 second mark that unloaded revolver sure doesn't look scary, IMO
0:40 I thought that was mike 😂 I was about to lose my shit
Who does he think he is? Mike Ehrmantraut?
I was liteary watching breaking bad and went on my phone then saw this on my reccomended
Bob Actionkirk
Saul Goodman after getting out of his dead-end job
John Wick 2.0 with family
And a history of violence
Cool just watch the whole movie in 3 minutes
So many references of john wick, the phrase nobody, him leaving a job, and also the gold he hid and weapons.
Hype !
I wonder if this takes place in the John wick universe?.......🤔 John wick vs. Nobody?
It used to be a Punisher type movie every 3-5 years, some were good and some were pretty bad. Now it looks like we'll be getting a John Wick type movie every 3-5 years and I'm not mad.
I wonder if wick makes a cameo? And if the kitty cat bracelet is like the dog from John Wick??
Damnnn Saull!!!!
Someone tell this guy , he better call Saul after all this .
"Are you ok, cus you dont look ok" itsallgoodman
Being a manager at a Cinnabon was not cutting it for him
This ad caught my eye so came here to see it again
This is like John Wick but instead of killing a dog they stole his daughter's Hello Kitty necklace  It's just as bad IM HYPED FOR DISSS
I knw its a lil similar to john wick but fuck you if ur not hyped for this 😅 this looks sick asf
Jesus Saul ,grew some bawls !
Watch it from Home or Theaters like everyone else. We understood its about to be 2021 and we had to change, for our customers. Sincerely Universal Pictures.
This is literally John Wick with Saul Goodman
This Nobody is John Wick's first student .
This looked great up until the former assassin, action film bullshit. A relatable story about a man taking justice in his own hands would be more interesting.
Еще один русский засветился в Голивуде)
In theatres only? I highly doubt that.
LONG LIVE SAAAAUUULLLL!!!!!!!
nobody:  Nobody:
just watched the whole movie w this trailer.
I thought Saul Goodman was a pussy.
What if John wick was a family man
All I Gotta say is “ FUCK YEAH “
Hell to the yeah!!!!
Yeah... I better call Saul
John wick?
Better call John Wick
Corps: who fuking are u ?0 Nobody: Better call Saul
You don't wanna make Saul Goodman into a Badman!
GIMME THE GOD DAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET! LMAO YASSS
Nobody is John Wick from alternate universe in which his wife lives
God I am so interested in this
I like how all the bad guys are white European types....in America. Super realistic.
Add a colon at the end of the movie name, it could be about extremely unfunny youtube comments
So is he friends with Johnny boy?
Love how the poster is almost the exact same as John wick 2
Welcome back Saul!
Better Saul wick
Not gonna lie, this looks a lot better than John Will lmao
Looks awesome!!!
Is this a John wick parody. Genuinely confused.
Same universe with Jhonwick?
In Theaters only, Covid19 👁👄👁
John Wick without a dead girlfriend
I thought this was a john wick parody
Damn, Bob Odenkirk is a badass.
Saul finally stood up for himself.
Seems like an extension of the John Wick universe, pretty dope.
The new John Wick
Damn Im definitely watching this movie
its all good man
Wow, an actual non-woke movie. I'm impressed!
Looks fun, pretty sure the trailer has spoiled the entire movie's best scenes, not a deal breaker for me though.
I already watched the movie because my dad is the vice chairman of universal
Okkkk breaking baddddddd sickkk
You don’t steal a kitty cat bracelet or else!
John wick-you kill.my dog Nobody-you stole my daughter kitty cat bracelet
Song track please..🤗
THIS SUBWAY SCENE, SUCH A JOKER MOMMENT
Plot twist he get arrested and in the court from nowhere  hear that voice (don't drink and drive and if u do ? Better call saul
I saw it when it was called John Wick.
So Saul is judge, jury, and executioner.
Pretty hard punch for a lawyer.
This looks pretty Good!
fuck ya, love this actor, looks great!
Better call Saul, not 911 haha..
This trailer for me more like THE RAID 2 vibes.  when he hit that wall and that bus fight scene similar to train fight in the raid
Sorry can't take him seriously because he's Saul.
*in theaters only*   Great! Now I won’t watch it!
Looks fun.
Plot twist: this is John Wick's dad
**DANCING FISH 🤣https://youtu.be/O15aR4ocp4Q
It's cool that Bob Odenkirk is in this and all, but is anyone else surprised that the guy who directed Hardcore Henry is behind this?
s'all good, man.
Dad Wick...
Ah they finally made a Max Payne movie
Im here to talk to you about the John Wicks initiative
Wow! did I just watched all the spoilers for all the action scenes in this movie?
Saul Goodman was actually a John Wicks kinda guy.
Saul Goodman going into John Wicks shoes.
This is who Bryan Callen wishes he was

Cronenberg did it better
02:37 Triple AWP collateral!
Dope
Saul Wick? Sign me tf in
So john wick
Saul became more serious
Hey YT, found the illegitimate child of Jock Whick and Taken.
Kill, kill kill kill, blah blah blah. Waste of a good actor for a pile of juvenile nonsense that looks like  a computer game while promoting violence and killing like its nothing .
how many times u seen this trailer❓👇🏾
Sal sure got some training with his new identity.
Hollywood: Guns are bad mmmk.  Also Hollywood:
"Who the f*ck are you"? "I'm Saul b*tch".
Thats what happens when you dont Call saul
What happens when you call Saul
Don’t call 911, you better call Saul
I just saw the whole movie. Sweet
This would have been a way better ending to braking bad
its like John Wick but instead of a dog its a mid-life crisis
John Wick: Father edition
when you demanded parking stickers from Saul Goodman one too many times
Mr Nobody in Fast and Furious?

Bro, that guy hit a trIPLE COLLAT!
I like this
what a heaping crock
History of violence × john wick × kick-ass × the equalizer × payback    = Nothing interesting
John Wicks secret uncle is getting his own movie, how exciting!
Fuck yeah!
"You should see the other guys that is so overused dialogue.common come up with something new hollywood.
Looks good. Reminds me of Clive Owen in "Shoot Em' Up"!
John Wick: You killed my dog Nobody: You stole my kitty cat bracelet
Wow! Better call Saul season 6 is fucking amazing!
Better ask Saul turns into John wick
Looks like theres will be some good movies out there
Soooo the joker wick... lol
"Are You Tired of Being Nice? Don't you just wanna go apeshit?" The Movie
This is going to be a hell of a fun time😁😁
Call 911! Call 911! But not for me >:D
Nothing better than a badass fight scene to the beat of a song that slaps.
Bollywood remake of #Nobody must be #ondemand now.
Season 5
this is going to be quite the parody
Da fuck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't call 911 How about Sal
"In theaters only" is a surefire way to make sure "Nobody" sees your movie.
I think many people will go on a trip to Belize
The Home Alone Kid all grown up
From vacuum cleaner sell to human cleaner  ..Jimmy has passed a long way
Don't call 911  Then whom shall we call  Better call Saul/Nobody.
Better call Saul
John Wick was here in earth 911.
it doesn't suit him, I think he's too slow and nerdy
"Better call nobody"
Equalizer ? Is that you ?
I'm in.
Nobody, but you.
Anyone know the name of the song they start playing around 1:13 cant place where I've heard it, any help would be wonderful! Thanks
So like John Wicks cousin or something?
The Comedy version of John wick instead of a Dog it’s a Cat lover lmao 😂
I hope 2021 is the year for the comeback of good old days, 2020 is so bad :(
Better Call Saul season 6 looking crazy
Nobody: What's up Jimmy? Oh wait, wrong movie.
"Let's just show the entire movie in the trailer!" - Some universal Pictures board member
Alright. If Leitch is building a universe of these types of films, just to ultimately bring them together in a Avengerables type mega flick, I'm all for it.
“In theaters only” ...that’s pure confidence in today’s world.
How is this not just a John Wick rip off
It would have been cooler if he wasnt trained in the secret club for men. What happened to just being a regular guy that had enough?
Well, I did not expect Better Call Saul ended this way...
nice!
saul on beast Mode!🔥
Liam Neeson is looking well
I love it. It clearly indicated the old men, Liam, Keanu, and Bob are kicking asses and taking names while the pussies generation are playing video games at homes.
When he says "don't call 911" 😂 Seems to be a good movie but wouldn't it be great with Kevin Costner or Liam neeson?
Slipping Jimmy has really done himself this time.
Паль...
Need them whacked  Better call saul
Kevin McAlister grew up to be John Wick
A dude flick!! Wow, it's been a while 👍🏼
Clone of John Wick
Better Call Bruce Wick
''GIVE ME THE GODMAE KITTY CAT BRACLITE''
He is gonna send all of them to Belize.
What song is this
I’m thinking’ he’s back up
Before this trailer: Better call saul After this trailer: Better call nobody      And yeah, don't call 911😝
Universal: "In Theaters Only"   WB: Fuck.
Alert : John Wick Genre has started.
*If John Wick had a dad*
Yesssssssss
Wow, Saul. He became such a Goodman
Im here bcz of better call saul
I like the concept, the fact he’s “nobody” is the very same reason you shouldn’t screw with him
Liam Neeson would have been great in this movie!
They stole his GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better call saul!!! If you have problem.😊
Better call........what the fuck!!!!!
In theaters only?   No I don't think so ;)
"My name is not important." Nobody: "That's cute."
Getting taxi driver vibes from this
fuck john wick, the overly-coordinated, steril-looking glance piece of sh*t. This looks grimier and that's what I want.
Let’s goooooooo
When the quite kid at school grows up and lets out the pent up frustration.
John wick s brother has entered the chat.
John Wick is in Same universe for sure !!
slippin jimmy aint slippin
Better call Saul
Be careful ! Don't look this crappy trailer, it's all spoiler !

Looks like sh1t
Bobody, BO-BODY
U callin me a liar Frank? I am the one who knocks!

Covid really got to john wick.
Fight Club + American Beauty + Breaking Bad
This is directed by the same guy that made Hardcore Henry.
Yeah we dont call 911 around here, its Saul Goodman we turn to
Its all good man
At least two bad gays was played by russian actors. Why I see you here, guys?))
por fin una película con testosterona carajo!!!!!
I wonder if this is in the John whick universe? 🤔💭
✨PHENOMENAL✨
Is this just John wick ?
OK. so Jimmy quits Cinnabon to become more badass than Mike and Walter.
"Better call Sa....Nobody"
Him emptying his revolver on the floor and then telling a group of guys,"I'm gonna fuck you up", is already one of my favourite quotes of the decade. And I also can't wait to see the rest of this movie, it looks awesome as hell and gives of Joker and John Wick vibes at the same time, a killer combination.
Man, I have to wait over 2 months to watch this?  :( I do find it funny they turned Saul into an action hero.  LOL
Saul Goodman's secret life
Don't call 911      better call saul !
so he's playing himself?
What if Mike Ehrmantraut Joins him. The bad guys would be wearing brown pants.
Don’t kill John Wick’s dog and don’t take this man’s daughter’s kitty cat bracelet
Mum can we have John wick? No, we have John wick at home John wick at home...
Better not call Saul.
February? Who goes to a theatre now a days. 😂 Everything is on demand. Thank you for being optimistic though.
You had me at............ "In Theaters Only"................ !!!
It's aul good man.
They killed the dog in John wick, it didn't panned out well for suckers. They stoled the kitty cat bracelet in this one... Oh wait!  😂
Superb.
Now Lalo is shaking after watching this trailer.
Stop showing the whole movie in the trailer.
Better DONT call Saul
They should merge it with John wick and create a Assassin universe
Why promoting so much violence and insecurity? This is why people get issues lmao. People in other cultures see this and question wtf is going on there?
John wick: Nobody
I'm taking this as an official sequel to Better Call Saul.
I'm speechless
Better call Saul got an upgrade lol
What....the...How...the....Just....WOW!!
I think Macho Man Randy Savage said it best.
Who is singing this song???
this is EXACTLY what happens when u start smoking Walters product....
You better dont call nine saul saul
One of the guy is the main actor of Kickboxer
These remakes are getting quicker each year. In 5 years it will be monthly, the remake of the remake of the remake part 3.
This is Gene from Cinnabon
But in reality Isreal parks a car in your front yard with a robotic gun and while youre taking the trash out everyone dies..
How many versions of the same script are there... This plot has been milked for years... 🤦‍♂️
Is this a parody of john wick or an extended universe movie?
saul goodman!
"iN TheATerS OnLy" I need that confidence
I want a crossover between this, john wick and equalizer
We all know he is John wick's older brother
Three words: YES YES YES!!!
So theres Russian men roaming American buses bulling people. Does American have any more original films to put out?
john wick rip of
So it’s a John Wick spin-off
Garuntee mr wick well somehow be mentioned or referenced in the movie
I wonder if this is in the same universe as John Wick...I wouldn't mind
wait a minute...  thats not kevin costner
Nobody   2020 to everyone : I gonna fuck u up
"Don't Drink And Drive, But When You Do, Call Saul"
John Wick 4?
John wick but with something to lose
Imagine this being a part of of john wick world or universe... And a collab might be incoming after creating enough hype
Better call NOBODY!!!!
John wick but her wife's alive
saul goodman fights the cartel (the movie)
If John wick had a family
John wick remastered
This 721 dislikers dont knows who know a guy who knows another.
so this is a cheap rip off of both John Wick and Deathwish? Yawn.
So he’s a hit man right?
When you don't pay Saul Goodman's fee on time.
This just looks like John Wick with extra steps
Dunno why they didn't just say "From the director of Hardcore Henry" as opposed to "Producer David Leitch of John Wick." Producer doesn't mean shit, has no bearing on the quality of the film.
Nobody vs John Wick
Next movie =somebody
Saul Wick
Ripping off Wick’s poster’s paying off.
Much waiting
I just wish they'd make more action movies that actually have some semblance of reality. Like Sicario.
I thought it was a nobody and others meme
Saul Wick
Awwww mayyyne look at ma dayme lawyer dawwg.
The *Boogeyman - 2.0*
John wick with family
That night I was John wick because I believed it.
Walter: Remember you told me that you know a guy who knows a guy from The Continental? Saul: He's busy. Walter: Then who's helping us now? Saul: Nobody
Holy Fuck 🔥
they couldn't get Kevin Costner for this movie so they got Bob Odenkirk.
Saul Goodman gone gigolo
Toxic masculinity the film lol
in theaters only?  I'm down, lets go!
Same thumbnail as john wick but instead of gun, its full of fist
I feel like I just watched the whole movie
He probably have a pretty good lawyer to keep him out of trouble.
John Wick - kills bad guys for his dead dog Nobody - kills bad guys for his kids kitty cat bracelet  When did we get so low...
Nobody *literally nobody means don't underestimate the power of  common men*
2:23 yes kill bill reference
Imagine if its Keanu Reeves in there.
This seems so good that I wish I I could unwatch the trailer and watch this without spoiling the whole movie basically..
Man ig you really should call saul
John wick 4
Me ??? Nobody🔥
It would be fucking cool if nobody was john wick's mentor or the original boogeyman
What that song in the back round called
Love Bob Odenkirk! Amazing actor!
My God! Saul could’ve took out Gus and all of his men but he didn’t want to do more damage.
wait, this is a joke right?
Alain Moussi is a real Martial artist, he's one of the bullies in the bus with the bottle
Talk about showing too much. Might as well just wait for the two-three fight scenes uploaded on youtube
I need boy friend
Couldn't afford Keanu Rreves I see
Saul Fucking Goodman.. Amazing trailer..
Enquanto John Wick 4 não chega, tem gente nova em algum lugar da Cidade, mandando vê anonimamente. Expectativas em altas.
Don't call 911. Better Call Saul!!!
Just don't call 911 💥
I’m digging this
uuuuuuuhhhhhhhh ... WHAT?!
“You can’t make an action hero out of just anyone.”  “Challenge accepted!”
Saul WTF?
John Wick ke chacha ji aa gaye
I'm ALL IN!!!!
Better call Saul? More like better call an ambulance
2021: conservatives vs the man.
0:41 Olds friends are together, again.
Personally, I sort of can’t take this movie seriously. Feels like a parody
this movie is a mix of lot of movies..... john wick (solo killing machine with lot of money left from the 'job' he used to do, its the kitty cat bracelet rather than the dog), deadpool (3 headshots with one bullet), never back down ("u should look at the other guy" dialogue), jack reacher (fighting style and that silent badass who blends in with the public), RED (old guy who has seen and done a lot and decides to retire..but his past follows him to his doorstep)....this is a Frankenstein of movies
I want to see Bob Odenkirk kick some ass
Saul goodman become badman
I love it how people throw long looping punches in movies you can see coming a mile a way.
So Bob Odenkirk is John Wick now?
This looks awesome!
john wick  lite  ( what this movie should named )
Nobody dear
better call nobody wick
Dis gives me History of Violence vibes! Who has seen the history of violence? Go watch awesome movie
It's kinda interesting to see Bob Odenkirk play such a dangerous character after primarily playing so many wimpy ones.
Like family man
Saul Goodman + Liam Neeson  = "Better Call Taken"
When Home alone kid finally remember who he really was when he was a kid. Now he beating up bad guys in style hahaha.
Amazing 🤩
Ok so why would i be watching the movie, when everything is explained in trailer
A History Of Violence vibes.
If saul was a badass
It's really very Goodman🔥🔥🔥
Definitely going to go see this.
John wick + better call saul = nobody
You simply can't tell me this is NOT in the same universe with John Wick series. For all I know, Nobody could be a "hit-brother" in John Wick's past LOL
Better call saul.. in such case.
Louie Prima in a 2020 commercial ❤
Season 6 of Better Call Saul lookin fine
*OLD* JHON WICK 🔥
It's all good man
so basically old man John Wick
Better Call Saul is BACK in FORCE !!!
Basically what would have happened if John Wicks wife didn’t die and he’d raised a family
Better Call John Wick.
Погодите, там Серебряков снялся, или мне показалось?
Was that Mike?!!!
I wonder if it takes place in the John wick universe
Ok Hollywood did it again They showed me the whole fucking film
Сол наконец-то вышел из себя.
Same Universe as John Wick? Will we meet John Wick? Nobody works for the same Organization?
Taken but a violent ballet.
this is literally a copy of john wick, by the producer of john wick it's literally just saul wick
John wick: they killed my dog Nobody:give me the god damm kitty cat bracelet
Shhh
Will definitely be going to see this!
Saul Goodman finally snapped.
Boss' son: "Who? That f-king nobody?" Boss: "That f-king nobody... is nobody."
It's like John Wick but older
That intro, i thought it's john wick parody lol
February is too far away
The sequel John Wick wanted!
and after this they should do a colab with Wick and Nobody :) That would be AWESOME!
When u make one good movie and run out of ideas just copy paste to make another one
Looks like you're gonna need a lawyer. Better call Sal
John wick in pararell universe
0:52 "I am not locked in here with you...YOU'RE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!"
"NOBODY said it was EASY!"
When it comes to INDIA
Like Max Payne❤️
damn, the fights look satisfying
"Buddha hoga tera baap!"
I smell team up
Rorschach?
Im really want to know...what they see jn trailer👎...maybe they are blinded when the action going on so bymistake they do the wrong thing......im just dying waiting for launch the movie🥳🤠🥳🤠🥳👍👍👍👍
damn it i was hoping it was a series!
Don't call 911 🤦 cringe
In theatres only? So...nowhere?
The pitch meeting was literally just "Saul... Wick." And honestly, I'm in.
Man they got Bob Odenkirk playing a super assassin?? What's next Bill Burr is gonna be the next terminator?? Ricky Gervais is gonna be the next Bond? 😆😆😆
Absolutely Nobody kids: ...  Nobody: I'm gonna fk you up!
Can't wait to watch this movie..
john wicks dad belike
1:10 I loved the song
Hmm, this looks like it will have a lot of quick cuts and 'standing, waiting to be punched' choreography... Love Bob Odenkirk, but I just don't see him as this kind of character. I really want to be wrong though!
Dude this looks pretty cool
Few years after this expect a crossover. Wick and Nobody take on The High Table.
They kinda gave the whole movie away with this trailer
🔥🔥it's interesting.
It S'all Good Man
FINALLY!!! Cat people get their John Wick!
Give my girl back her kitty cat bracelet!!
This new season of Better Call Saul looks dope!!
Will there be any movie theaters left open to go to?
awesome
Saul losing control
That actually looks like a fun film.
1000 times better than Indian Sahoo movie
Nobody:John wick meet Weasley from Wanted
Hill - My name is nobody. Bond. The name is no nobody
Another John Wick series is in works, Iassume.
U know when guy on the good side says *don't call 911*  Then it's the time for bad people to set 911 on speed dial you know just for the  *INSURANCE* 😁
Scriptwriters should honestly try and come up with some new stuff but then again audiences are so dumb they don't want anything new.
john wick all over againe
Jimmy McGill got mad. LoL
Plot twist: This is Mr. Nobody's origin story from Fast & Furious
Is that saul goodman is all good man?
i love the swag 😎🤘
this is like john wick mixed with bruce willis' movie RED
Poor Saul just wanted to retire! 😂😂
John wick vibes 🔥🔥❤️
This actually looks really good . Also when I was watching this trailer , couldn't help but think this would also make a great gritty graphic novel . That look at the end with all the wounds on his face is reminiscent of something like Punisher
If theres a sequel, and johnathan banks isnt in it Im gonna turn nobody
"You ok?... Cause you don't look ok"
SO THISSS is why Better Call Saul Season 5 isnt on Netflixxxxxxxx. Im so pumped for this!
This has to be related to John Wick..
Nobody....Nobody....Nobody....does it better.
Better call Wick....
When you kill john wicks dog: When you steal Nobody's daughter's kitty cat bracelet: Where's the kitty cat bracelet!!!

He went from Saul Goodman to Saul Badassman
Good to see that the Faceless Men survived long after medieval times
Looks great !!!
Don't call 911, better call Saul.
Hahaha...😂😂😂I know him... He is Saul.. better call saul
A History of Violence anyone?  I thought of it within five seconds of watching.
When Nobody is John Wick's brother
I can't wait 😊
The hell... Saul Goodman?
All you had to say was this was directed by the guy who did Hardcore Henry...I'm in!
That Nobody is John Wick
Looks good.
I'm truly hoping theaters will be open again (in Italy) by the 26 of february!!
69k likes 690 dislikes
Looking nice 😍😍😍😍😍
They have my attention. Lets hope it is as good as the trailer.
I would LOVE to go see this... But it seems the world is in fear of dying from some magical bug that was only able to kill .002 percent of the world and only killed the old and infirm... Hell there are many other things out there that kill much more. I wish my great great great grandma could have lived forever...
Thanks for showing the full movie in less than 3 minutes.
what if... in the aftercredits "Nobody" pays some one with certain gold coins... linking this film to the John Wick universe?
Yup. :)
Yesssssss. This is particularly badass for fans of Mr. Show
Action is at its peak  👍🏻👍🏻...no comparison for john wick...
damn I cant wait till feb 26 what if i die to corona
songname anybody? :)
*Why is nobody talking about the kitty cat*
who the fking nobody  that fking nobody is heisenberg's lawyer
Saul just become nobody
Damn this looks DOPE !!!!
That 'nobody' is John Wick
Is this John wicks dad
I hope they make a cameo with John, that would be so damn cool
What happens when an asset like John Wick goes rogue and comes after the table. You bring in Mr. Nobody!
Jessy would be proud now he turnout to be Pretty badass
John wick cousin
You never stole with a dog or a fucking kitty kat bracelet.
"Im just another Nobody"
Why does bob look like a deep fake??? Is it just me

Русские здесь
Saul had enough. He is the danger!!! He's the one comes knocking
Epic!!!!😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌👌
John wick meets joker?
Awesome
Saul Wick
seems like going to be another masterpiece same as John wick..
Honestly thought this was a parody movie about John Wick,turns out i'm excited to see this.
Am I the only person who wants a John Wick: Sofia Origin Story?? Halle Berry kicked ass in that movie, so much it actually distracted me from how cool Keanu Reeves is.
Good for you, Saul. Good for you.
So memers regularly uses the name of this guy
alright... punch me with john wick joke
If "Nobody" doesn't get a 4K UHD release, on disc, I'm going to be so fucking disappointed. I have high hopes that it will though!! Definitely going to be the best movie of 2021. Hands down.
Average Joe/Jill: puts on mask 😷 goes to see film in Feb. Catches covid anyway.   "It was totally worth it" -Nobody
Yes, i want this!!
Looks like a South indian movie,but with a bit of Logic and physics!
That’s awesome man 👌
If he's get caught,,,, he didn't have to hire a lawyer
Mike and Saul!
So 684 sry 1.9k people really hate kittens.
I was waiting for him to say “Saul Goodman”
It's all fun and games until the nice, quiet guy tips over.
Saul Goodman being lowkey
Dadbod 3 The return of dadbod
Plz release in Hindi language also
Guess he gave up his job at Goliath National Bank.
So it is another john wick movie series but you couldn't  find a cool name like wick :D
I will be watching this.
Finally, a movie that I am interested in seeing. Not the usual SJW superhero crap.
YES! UNEQUIVOCALLY... YYYEEESSS!
Don't call 911.... You better call Saul"....
This Bruce walls movie not this actor
Ха-ха Серебряков
This is a spin-off of John Wick, they will meet in John Wick 4, The Encounter
Are they implying that John wick is a nobody
Это какая-то ПАЛЬ
This actor is too slow for this kind or action.
What's a theatre?
Never Underestimate.....................................Nobody!
I like his innocent old face😈😈😈😈😈
Man....what an emotional action revenge....combination.....wow man
sorry but these fight scenes look really dumb. his little elbow hit knocks the guy out? what is this easy mode?

Now it makes sense, when Vigo was telling to his son Iosef, " That fucking NOBODY is John Wick" :-p haha
Might this be going to better then John Wick ........
John Wick but he's a family man.

People are saying that Hutch Mansell is John Wick without realizing that it's actually Jimmy McGill.   Gene was a ruse.
From  It's all good man  To  It's all BAD MAN
idk, if its the years watching this guy play Saul Goodman, but it s a little hard for me to buy into him as a John Wick clone
He is combination of Liam Neeson from taken and John wick.
2:37 Every Operators dream
John Wick vs nobody ................
Ok time to " better call saul"💥
American Dad power fantasy movies, so hot right now

Imagine if this was set in the same universe as John Wick...
When you decide to go through a playthrough with maxed out Gun skill instead of maxed out Speech
Mind-blowing
Saul Goodman changed
This second part of "A History of VIolence" looks dope
Hell yeah! I will be waiting like a frozen man for this movie till Feb.  #nobody
John Wick vs. Mr. Nobody... anyone?
Found John Wick's long lost brother
it's like i am watching John wick again.. what a trailer and bgm makes this trailer awesome. must watch.
Everyone's making references to boost the likes they get but is no one going to discuss that this is literally John Wick made by the people that worked on John Wick? Jeeze, you'd think during this pandemic some creativity would arise..
Finally a movie in excited to see
So last one they shot a dog , this time they steal a kitty bracelet 🤣🤣🤣
What ever u do.. U r still our lovable jimmy....
that f*ckin' nobody is john wick
Looks great, just Stop showing the whole F@kin Film on the Trailer you dickheads !!!   do you never learn !
i find the lack of saul jokes in the comments disturbing
I see a John Wick/Nobody crossover in the imminent future.
This time its not a dog Its a kitty cat
Nobody: No, literally NOBODY:
Did we just... find out the perfect Jack Reacher?
Thank god, it's not another marvel movie.
Saul Wick
*this is Rambo and John Wick but daddy version*
Nobody is perfect
Don’t steal tugboat. This is a warning.
Oh mannnnnn this is Awesomeness
whats the background music ?
John wick - dog kill = ruins entire world Nobody - kitty bracelet = ruins entire world   🤔
Пушка бля))
I wish they were making a John wick cinematic universe.
Better not call Saul
better not call Sauk
Wooo best action pictures
Saul you are  a lawyer  wtf u doin
Better call Nobody.
“Give me the god dammed kitty-cat bracelet!”.
More like this please.
Nobody better call Saul
I have a very particular set of skills...
John Wick after retirement  again
John Wick finally has a family
They literally showed the full movie in the trailer
everyone:  after covid clears up
He didn't take his family out of the basement
This is literally john wick
So when better call Saul season 5 ended he said IL do it myself, and he becomes a weapons contractor after few years Nobody happens, that would be soo cool
parallel universe of john wick....
Bob odenkirk, im gonna watch it.
And  then next there comes a movie where John Wick meets Mr. Nobody
Goddamn Saul Wick.
What was that shitty song all about. If that background noise is categorised as a song.
This is going to be epic!!
"gime the kity cat bracelet xDDddD" Aaand the movie is now wrecked
Legalize guns and not drugs. "An armed society is a polite society."
Why is it always Russians?
Saul is back
John Wick : Fighting for a dog Nobody: Fighting for a kitty cat bracelet
Look Prez from Long Shot made it big in movies
Ok Who wants Nobody vs John wick?
Then he wakes up and has a very similar ending like in Malcolm in the Middle
Cat loving alternate John Wick
Better call Saul I think
thats a mix of john wick and jason statham. iam in
Damn looks goodd
Why am I not seeing single breaking bad or better call Saul references here!? 😱
Finally we getting to see a fantastic action movie from lovely John wick director..👍👍
When Saul said he knew a guy who knows a guy who knows other guy, I never knew he meant John wick
i saw him kill man in a bus with a bottle, with fcking bottle
Better call him
I was expecting the story was gonna be about just your average guy that ends up cracking under pressure and goes full vigilante but no, it's just another John Wick (not that I'm complaining, this movie looks amazing)
That South Indian sound track 😂
This man got some really solid Punch...
Wick-verse?
Saul turned into a badass, guess hes done wit the lawyer shit
The person who made this trailer is epic
Better call Saul..
Boboddy!!
JOHN WICK:PUPPY NOBODY:KITTEN
Шикарно
I believe this must be in the same universe with John Wick.
First a dog. Now a cat. I wonder whats next?
ME TAKING ONE DOLLAR FROM MY BROTHERS WALLET: DONT CALL 911
Nice
bro thats john wicks older/little brother
Anybody know what this song is called?
Some good after John wick series.
Nobody is everybody
Oh no
Is it just me or does anyone feel some JOKER vibes in this trailer?
Mission Impossible, John Wick, Upgrade now this? Ladies and gentlemen, Action Movies are back
Im theaters hahahaha LOL 😂 😷🤦🏻
Police : Who is Nobody? Nobody : I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy who might tell you who is Nobody.
Basically, this is "Better Call John (Wick)"
Well, I never underestimated Saul
IS there anything more to watch  on february 26?
Theatrical peice agree😎 After two months only on Amazon prime🤐 Before Amazon prime T** R***$   Hence the proof😎
Yea , I`ll BITE
Please let it be on the same universe as John Wick
Everybody can relate to this guy, because were nobody.
This was directed by the Russian Director Ilya Naishuller that made the Hardcore Herny movie! 😍 It will be a blast for sure. 🇷🇺
i am quite surprise by BGM
From Lawyer to Broken Hero!
okk JOhn wick but Cheaper version
Is it me or did someone else just got Jhon wick vibes after watching this
genials
John wick: You can copy my work just make sure it’s different  Nobody: Sure
Don't tell me, he is gonna kill 3 guys in a bar with fucking pencil too.
Yosef: "That nobody?" Viggo: "That fcking nobody was nobody."
i knew this guy acted in Breaking Bad💥
Copy of john wick.....
Sounds like a Liam Neeson movie
Im secretly hoping this doesn't turns out as good as John Wick, but i think this is gonna break heart 🙈
Better call Nobody
father of john wick
saul from breaking bad lawyer to assassin wow🔥🔥
Wexler-McGill..
John Wick - Ahh.. finally... A worthy opponent.
Ok.  I really like this.  WHy? I don't know a single actor inthis. So its just so hilariousu and fun for me. I dunno if that guy is actualy well known for most or not.  I liked john wick and other "i kill everyone" movies.  but I really love it with a literal nobody leading it.  I don't expect things.
Just Call Saul
Im excited 😁
I thought this was a parody on John wick when I saw the thumbnail
"I'll send you to Belize"
Does it better👄
This is what happens when you push a lawyer too much🙏
I got a Wanted vibe. I love it
He better call Saúl
1:14 gets me every time 😭😂😂
This will be a nice PR makeover for Odenkirk!
big fan
Oh man! Trailer is so cool.
It looks "GOOD MAN"
WOW
I feel like this might be in the same cinematics universe as John Wick. The creators have often spoken about spin offs and expanding the franchise. We'll see. Excited regardless
Everyone is talking about Johnwick, but I'll suggest you "better call Saul"
Presenting Saul Badman
This is just a sequel to breaking bad
Jimmy: Give me the goddamn space blanket...!
Only because I love Bob Odenkirk, - and because he still deserves a lot of delayed credit for the years he was ignored in Hollywood circles - will I check this out. I hope we don’t look back in a few years and cringe at how much praise everyone heaped upon him as making up for lost time and begin to regret him for it though
"Do you even know who he is? " "What.. He's fucking nobody! " "That fucking nobody is 'NOBODY'.. !
after all something perfect to watch. Loved it!
Saul Goodman
Bob Odenkirk went from James Mcgill to Saul 'Fuck u up' Goodman.
Shawn of the Dead but in John Wick Universe.
Finally a movie I can watch!
Wick is a family man now
" Better call *NOBODY* "
I think if it wasn't for Bob Odenkirk this would be just a generic action movie. Something about this actor in a John Wick like role makes my senses tingle...
I am so fucking hyped
John wick 😉 nobody 😘
Ek tha tiger 😜
He kinda looks like an old Chris Evans.
Is this walters lawyer?
1:17 that soundtrackkkkk
noone is gonna say anything about the tripple headshot??from 2m away??with a sniper rifle???
Even the poster is the same as John Wick lol
Not really interested. This is just "A history of violence" all over again. Which by the way was awesome.
Is this in the same universe as John wick?????
Is this the Wick-Verse or something?
It's all good man
We all can be John Wick!
SAUL GOODMAN after being fired from cinnabon
Better call Saul  Lawyer services  “Cleaning services now added”
0:41  For a second I thought it was Mike Ehrmantraut
Don't call 911, Better Call Saul)
Nobody:   Absolutely nobody: Nobody
Shit, waiting to watch
John wicks brother
Mike Ehrmantraut: That's great but you're still short on stickers.
Dont call 911...call jon wick
See how universal put that "in theaters only" thing....man these guys are taking a dig at wb
Trained by Mike Ehrmantraut himself...
Ray mak
F__k yeah.  I can relate.  😁👍👍
Better call Saul
I can really relate to this guy! xD
This guy needs a good lawyer after all those fights, better call Saul 😉
John Wick : "You killed my puppy and     stole my car" Nobody : "You stole my daughter's kitty cat bracelet" 🤣🤣🤣
So this is what the Saul is doing off screen. He should focus on law.
This is why you don't steal a Kitty Cat Bracelet!
Just wow
its deadpool's life from a cat's perspective...
He is boogyman who got killed by JW.
So He Replaced  Keanu Reeves  🤔
Too bad, I can't watch it on cinema. Got to wait for few more months for the home release.
I am seeing the alternative r multiverse of John wick
Ohhh a piece of candy!
First seat booked come on release it Now
a candidate for Max Payne 3
my boy slippin' jimmy!
B O B O D D Y O B O D D Y  Now, what is the first B stand for?
Mike - I’m impressed Saul.  Saul Wick   Coming Soon
Music super I love trailer I'm india
Imagine Liam Neeson in this role...
Better call nobody
Hey Screen Rant! Here's a Super Easy Barely an Inconvenience Pitch Meeting for ya.. xD
John wick 4: nobody
John wick without a suit
Jimmy aka Saul goodman  quits his lawyer life and joins the gangsters🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wooow ,trailor look interesting
John Wicks old man!
Don't call 911 👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Initial minutes and I knew John Wick connection was there
Taken meets John Wick.
This is like a John Wick universe... Maybe this is a colleague of John Wick.. senior assassin or something else
Pretty sure Derek Kolstad would create "Nobody vs John Wick" for us someday..
soo wanted bob Odenkirk to do a movie like this, he is a gem of an actor.
Who the Hell are you?  Me? I’m Saul Goodman!
Seems like John wick 👍🏻
Err it just looks like john wick not that it's a bad thing
John wick + breaking bad' = 🔥
It's all good man🔥
Fuck yess
Directed by the man who made the best first person movie
I hope this becomes part of a JWCU. Do it nice and subtle just have the continental as a location or something as a nod to start
Daddy wick
Better Call Nobody
This looking kinda hard
I know a guy who can give u an app where u can find any movies or series in 720p,1080p even in 3d print, stream or Download, its like cracked Netflix with Google servers
GREAT SCOTT!
don't call 911 just call soul goodman
Okay !!!, lets gooooo
You have got the "Nobody" problem.  Better call Saul.
Холливуд догоняет Индийское кино
Soul goodman wtf
Damn.. Why i got so excited with the trailer? The producer of John Wick never fail to impress me
Better call Saul good man
Eeeeh... I was expecting a movie about some guy who was too weak willed to protect his family and he ends up becoming a stronger person. Instead we get another common action movie like every other out there. The 'nobody' tag is basically irrelevant.
Is this the start of a John Wick Universe?
"Give me the goddam kitty cat bracelet..."lmaoo 😂😂😂
John Wick Ultra Pro Max
Another crouching tiger hidden dragon character
So Saul Goodman lived a live beyond a life.
OH ... MY ... FLIPPING ... GOD! Take my money!
For those who search for a realistic movie.
We'll done to the writers, producers and director for not squeezing in some unnecessary political or SJW message, this looks like a hit!
It looks great ..till I saw in theatres only...
Anyone knows the song during bus fight scene and even after that?
Music / song ???
Holly mother of Jesus
this guy could play in dc or marvel let him in!
John Wick: Kills because of a Dog  Nobody: Kills because of a goddamn Kitty Cat Bracelet.
John wick 50 years old crisis?
Bloooody yankaaaaaaaaz
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
If someone says they're gonna f you up so casually, you better believe it 😂😂
Slippin' Jimmy strikes back!
Nobody    Absolutely nobody : 🗣️
Hope this connected to the John Wick universe an have an intercourse along the franchise
Could be "Death wish 2" looks good though
He should better call saul now
I love it
Cops: how many casualties? What is count for body? Sir,I guess I have No body here 😂
No.   This is basically John Wick but worse. "I left my old superbadass assasin life and wanted normality but than my past started to come back and now i have to murder my way through a million people for the sake of the plot."
"who? that fucken nobody?"
I have a great idea!John Wick wth diffrent actor...
"It's not fucking *John Wick* , It's *nobody* !"
John wick 4
“That nobody is john wick”
This looks like a Barry movie
Damn good background music 🔥
Saul Goodman 🔥🔥😂
Dont call 911 . Then,  Better call saul😜
Hollywood: ‘look how awesome guns are and how they make your righteous and powerful defenders of justice’.  Hollywood actors and directors and producers: ‘guns need to be confiscated, they’re a danger to national peace, give up your guns or you’re evil’.
This is what happens when Saul get bored of being a lawyer.
Wow, very nice fight scenes
Hey, that looks like that one guy who's served me coffee and cinnamon buns down at the mall right here in Omaha!
If he play pubg then
When you're nobody, u can do anything. For example, Nobody has 200 hands Nobody can lift herself Nobody....oh you fill it up as u wish
Hollywood is definitely desperate 🤣🤣🤣
I dig such ideas for movies. They do tend to play with your mind. Such highly skilled people, that are 'retired' can / do exist. There need to be people who do the dirty jobs and then, when their services are no longer required, go back to civilian. This makes the plot plausible. John Wick wasn't the firt to play this string.  Remember the movie 'Red' ?
Thank goodness they showed the entire movie in this trailer... 😕
Saul Goodman finally lost it.
I searched up John Wick and this appeared now i know why.
Looks like a great movie ruined by the trailer, would have loved to find out in the film that he was an ex-badass. Would have been the best plot twist
Nobody is slippin' today
It was a puppy now it a kitty cat
gimme the gotdamn bracelet
0:28 thought everyone would be talking about this  WM= Wexler McGill
Damn this looks good!
BRO THIS IS A MOVIE?! MAN I WANTED A 10 PART SERIES THIS IS FAN-FUBARING-TASTIC!!
actually I interested see this more than I have ever been interested to a john wick movie
oh my
Better call Saul😂😂😂
What a weird and wonderful casting choice.
Who the Fuck are you  Me : Better call Saul Godman
Better call saul!!! 😂
We have come to this..no more action figure like tom cruise..perfect on everything..just need a nobody..i can relate.. LOVE THIS!
"Don't call 911." "Then whom should we call?" "I know a guy who knows a guy.  Wait no, no, no.... Better Call Saul!"
Wow saul goodman zzz😎✌🏽
John Wick called Saul.
Saul Goodman is Breaking Bad
Now that's what I call as an action movie... It makes you go.. "Whatta mannn..!!!" in the theatres. I just can't wait to see this adrenaline-pumper. ;-)
John wick in his 70s
His power 🦾 🖤 2021
Fight club + john wick = nobody 😂😂
Random guy who pissed him off: "He is a f***ng nobody".  Boss: "Yes, he is nobody. But that's the problem."
The executive producer is Tobey Maguire. Fun Fact: This is based on his life
1:30 I thought he would say"BETTER CALL SAUL" again..😂😂
Saul badman
Better-not-call Saul
Wow this looks like the trashiest American movie I've seen in a while.
THIS. IS. BAD. ASS. PERIOD.
Bob Odenkirk: For 12 years I've  worked for very dangerous people.   Me: *VIETNAM FLASHBACK*
Shit !
So...John Wick 4 trailer is out
And after all the shooting, NOBODY went to the Continental Hotel to have a drink.
Saul Goodman
Home Alone 4 Nobody's Home
Man, Breaking Bad's crazy.
He might need a lawyer, then it'Saul goodman
These are among the trailer which u wish u can forget but also remind yourself that u have to watch this movie
I didn't give you consent to name a movie after me?    Where are my rights?
Possible John Wick universe tie in: He is the "Auditor", he's the guy High Table send when some people forgets to pay their debts, in the same ranks as the Adjudicator that punishes people for mistakes.
From Better call Saul to Better Call 911
I just noticed the kitty-cat at 2:47
Lets get a Tom Hanks action movie. Saying a short woody line or something before popping some thugs. I would watch it.
oh so he isnt working on cinnabon anymore
Loved the Train Action Sequence 🔥🔥
A History of Violence
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy😃😃😃
Another John wick in the making
The actor looks like a lawyer. He should have his own lawyer type show
No body absolutely No body..    Universal Studios: No body
wow
Saul's new identity looks scetchy
Saul Good man
Don't play fuck with this badass...
A cross between A history of violence, Death Wish and John Wick
I can never watch the better call saul the same again after this
Mr Saul Goodman is Nobody now...huh...I was waiting for new episodes of Better Call Saul and he became a Nobody
Poor Saul influenced by Heisenberg
We need more movies like this men.
This is Johan Wick after turning 50 years old
I liked Bob's work but this is Saul Goodman with some overpowered strength. Kinda weird, the trailer is trash.
Better call Saul
He should've called saul.
A history of violence + John Wick + Saul Goodman
don' call 911... YOU BETTER CALL SAUL!!
from saul to nobody. Incredible
Very john wick like
0:55 Is that Alain Moussi?
PLOT twist:-his brother was John wick
That Naughty America intro makes complete sense now.
0:28 wexler mcgill logo
he's a man of culture 🖖🖖
Saul goodman. 😍😍😍
ସୁନ୍ଦର.. 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹♥️♥️
So...A History of Violence meets John Wick? Nice.
me ready for study youtube notification: 0:59
That sound track is awesome man....
This! Is a movie!
Ok! What!?
so this what happened to Saul Goodman after he escaped and Walter White died. Intense guy.
S’all good man😂
Name should have been 'Father of The John Wick'😂
When being a lawyer for gangs got too boring
The thumbnail reminds me of john wick
John Wick Lite
Better call Saul is so dengerous I didn't knew
Wonderful sir❤️❤️
Watch this just before playing Cyberpunk 2077 then it will all make sense
Brainless, mindless, by the numbers, cliched, ridiculously unbelievable to the point of it being impossible to suspend the willingness of disbelief... Yeah, the docile, unthinking masses will lap this shit up.
After Mr. Nobody , there is another 'Nobody'
This movie's gonna show us, What if John Wick had a family.  Wanna see the movie though.
This is Hollywood closing the door on this genre for good.
This is Hollywood closing the door on this genre for good.
This is my kind of filmmaker, I don't want it but I need it.
this movie is what would happened if john wick's wife doesn't die.
i dont give the fuck it is the copy of john wick,i just gonna see!!!!
Saul Breaking Bad.
"Better call nobody"
no buddy
saul goodman after breaking bad
Would be so cool if he was in the John wick universe
1:34... Ya better call saul
He reminds me alot of john wick
better not call saul
They should have let him keep his “I need a new dust filter for my Hoover MaxExtract PressurePro model 60” life. Big mistake
John wick played by saul goodman
Just call Saul
Is he Saul Goodman from breaking bad I love that show
I really hope it's the same world as John Wick
Ow this is the guy ho knows a guy who knows another guy
I'll go to watch this movie on theater, and eating pop corn. Damn I hate covid
Better Call Saul
I'm in
"Better call Saul" from basement
If John Wick's wife hadn't died.
He is mr Saul from breaking bad
And thats when Saul Goodman finally turned into... wait, sorry, wrong movie.
This is a dream of every GUY !! *I'm gonna fuck you up* !  0:55
That music at 1:12 👌👌❤️
Better call SAUL
Better call Saul
When Saul Goodman exchanges careers with John wick!
He had the gold bars towards the end which are also in John Wick so does that confirm they're in the same universe?
Song name plzzz
First a puppy, now a kitty cat bracelet . . .
You better call Saul now!
Another guy who retired from a job . Something happened and now his back
John wick but less russian.
It looks awesome.
Saul Wick?
Those guys are probably sent by Lalo
So hyped to watch him on the bigger screen ❤️
Why do I feel every comment is gonna be related to breaking bad???
Kevin Costner looks good in this movie.
Perfect.
Better Call Saul ☺️
Damn those vocals and and that scene really gave me Goosebumps 1:10
This is just John wick if his wife didn’t die.
Fuck...Saul Goodman turning badass John Wick.  Im Sold.   Cool as hell.
Even when nobody is in trouble .. you need a lawyer.. better call saul.🤣
I'm just here for the Better Call Saul references in the comments...
Can't these movie studios come up with an original idea? Most films are just a rehash of a past movie, same story line, horror movies would have to be the worst culprit of this, Blair Witch was original, lost tape scenario, how many times has that been copied. Anyway this movie looks ok to waste an hour or 2 but it will be like re-watching something , you know whats going to happen
I am just nobody too and mess with me that you will wake up the destroyer in me
I hope this is part of John wick universe
Sal finally settled down, had some kids, stashed some guns and got his own movie huh
I hope this is part of John wick universe
John wick if his wife didn't die of cancer
Its not john wick its Saul wick😂
saul learned this shit from mike...
The guys on that bus obviously never saw the equalizer!
Saul Godman on fire
Cant wait cant wait cant wait!!!!!!
Nobody: Universal Pictures:
This is in the John Wick universe? Cool.
Another sequel of Home alone?
This looks dope!
He somehow resembles Walt of Season 5
Sal before he meets walter white.
This looks like john wick but with different cast and name😂😂
Is he john wick cousin?
Better call Saul Whatever your NOBODY 😂🔥🔥👌
From creators of John Wick. What I could expect? Romantic movie? Why do they always show everything in the trailer? :D :D
അ ആദകച്ചക്കോ ആദാ ചാക്കോ എഏ.. ഒഓ.. അആ..
"Don't call 911". Better call Saul
Goooood
*On February 26* Coronavirus: *laughs in evil*
He better Call Saul for "legal" matters.
I saw this movie when it was called History Of Violence. I actually even worked on it.
All I am getting jhon wick's vibe here..... Sounds good to me 😎
I know a guy who knows a guy.
My God Thats Crazy
Saul Goodman: Multiverse
Just, don't call saul.
This is what happens when u push a lawyer to his limits....🤘😬
If this isn’t connected to john wick I’m going to commit my own war crimes.. jk obv

Bob Odenkirk, sign me up!!!
He wants that kitty cat bracelet but he has all the hello kitty burner phones
Looks fun; let’s all pray COVID doesn’t F up the release 🧡
Shades of A History of Violence
Omg....
After a long time I got exited for a film.....waoo... can't wait to watch it.🔥
2022: Nobody Vs John Wick
John wick lost his dog. This man lost his kitty cat bracelet.  Coincidence? guess not
The movie feels like a John Wick vibe. Already love it.
This is not the Saul I know😍
**Spoiler alert**  There is a crossover scene of john wick and nobody  in post credits.
What the song they use in the bus fight scene?
Better call Saul
YES
2:21 Kill Bill scene cornflakes
So first a lawyer then a criminal lawyer and then a criminal  Looks like an interesting life
Woahh
john wick- You killed my dog Nobody- You took my kitty Cap
Plot twist: he's John Wick's elder brother
Saul has multiple personalities !!!
Damnn this look soooo good. The better be in the same universe as John wick
Bob Odenkirk yea I’m sold.
What is the name of the song???
Wait! so Arya Stark's cult is still active in Modern Day .
He better call a criminal (that's a) lawyer after that mess
This looks great . Just imaging the team up with John wick 🔥
"He's is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will... I once saw him kill three men in a Cinnabon in Nebraska... with a cinnamon roll, a f%$^ing  cinnamon roll!"
I can't wait for John Wick vs Nobody (auditor) vs The Accountant w/ Ben Affleck to come out 2022...I forgot Mr. & Mrs. Smith too..
When your dad has a secrete lock keypad in basement switch board you should know that the shit is about to go down.
Where have I seen this guy? I better call Saul and ask him
Saul Goodman is buffed up!!
Bob odenkirk turning into a savage animal nice!
The trailer is fantastic but where is Mike?
Nobody:  Universal Pictures: Let`s call our next movie "nobody"!
John wick Equilizer The mechanic Red 1,2  And another one from the same department Nobody  😂😂🤔 Just make Dont underestimate the power of a common man  A frustrated layman is more than enough  No need him to be a suspended agent or army man 😂😂😂
OOOOOOOOOO WWOWO  It's all good man ....
When John Wick got older and settled down but the buggers came and the story begin.
Music ✌️
What’s the song used in this
John wick vs nobody
He look like die hard guy
Omg
WHats up with these thugs? killing a dog? now taking a kitty cat bracelet?????
when John Wick gets fed up and starts a family. again.
So, this is the life Saul chose
Better call Nobody
And I thought I'll get to see this guy only in breaking bad and better call saul
Bob Odenkirk has that vulnerability about him which makes him dangerous and funny at the same time.
John Wick-Wish Edition
That's cool man💥
OMG 😆 👍
Why do they have Russians acting like black peoples? Russians don’t harass women on train
What does your dad do for a living?  Takes the trash and recycle.
perfect character and genre for Odenkirk as he winds down from Saul.
This might happen to Jimmy if he doesn't hire Mike 😵
Me while watching the trailer: Hmmm, looks familiar. Trailer: Directed by Same guy who killed John Wick's Dog. Me: Ahhhhh, got it. 👍👍
" If you are in problem- Better call soul"   Nobody - F*** the problems.. 😂🤣
Vigo: That NOBODY is John Wick
John Wick but funny
Back in the days he is known as "no one" from the free city of Braavos
John Wick Vs Nobody
Hey guys don’t miss on this must watch short film ‘Dafan’ https://youtu.be/HUV1uWF9HQQ
I never thought I wanted to see Bob Odenkirk in a John Wick-style action movie, and now I do.
Serious  John Wick vibes!!
The best one-man army movie till date was Equaliser I and I hope this going to fare better that
I hit the like button faster than i hit my wife
John Wick, minus the dog and a tad funnier. Still better than most of the shit coming out these days
I like how the promo poster for this movie looks almost exactly like John Wick's, but instead of guns pointed at him, he's just getting punched in the face
It's all good man
this is not how i ever pictured odenkirk, but he's a damn good actor... gotta see this
Saul goodman broke bad. Very very bad.
Alternate universe where John Wick's wife didn't die
Please 2021 do this favor and open the theaters! Wanna watch this in big screen not on my damn tablet!
the man, the myth, the legend. Mr. Nobody
This time it's a Kitty Cat bracelet.
This Saul doesn't need to be called !
who the f disliked this?
You better call Saul!
Hell yeah Saul Goodman plus guns!!
*shivering* "Imma better call Saul..!"
i wish this is in the John Wick universe.
They killed his dog Tugboat
John Wick, meets the Accountant, meet Taken, meets Nobody...............Okay....I'm in!!!!!!!!
Saul really went downhill after dealing with Walter
This is what middle age john wick look like if his wife still alive
Hell ya!!!! Bob Odendrick
Background song name plz
sooo...Walmart John Wick?
I wish this was in the same universe with John Wick.... Or maybe, make him as John Wick Mentor/former partner or something....
your honor to be fair they stole my kitty cat bracelet
Better call saul is one of the main reason i love breaking bad what a legend my inspiration
That fucking nobody, is John Wick
Saul good man!
Yep another white dude “superhero” movie
please let it connected to john wick story....
This is the lit stuff, What's everyone waiting for, Can't wait for it,Just watching trailer gives me so much joy and energy, Awesome it is🔥👍🏽
What theaters are going to be around in February to go see this movie in?
0:28- The logo created by Jimmy McGill in Better Call Saul. Any one remembered?
Don't Call 911. Better Call Saul...
Better Call Saul!
0:56 Jensen Ackles look-alike!
This should came in Trilogy, or I will riot
he should better call saul
JOHN WICK meets HOME ALONE?? Um, no thanks.
Crossover with John whick
This is probably happening in the John Wick universe.
Boss: „Why did you hit my son?“  Henchmen: „He stole his daughter’s bracelet sir“  Boss: „Oh...“
John Wick : "You killed my Dog"  Nobody: "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!"
In theaters only... such nice words to hear
'John Wick': Inciting criminal act for the _ENTIRELY JUSTIFIABLE_ ensuing vengeful bloodbath:- A cruelly murdered cute beagle puppy dog named Daisy, a poignant gift from a sadly deceased beloved wife. 'Nobody': Inciting criminal act for the _ENTIRELY JUSTIFIABLE_ ensuing vengeful bloodbath:- *"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!"*
What a premise!
Mr Nobody has more fanbase than Rey's, Wonder woman's, all Mary Sue's combined. Change my mind.
Anyone else catch the wm (wexler McGill) coffee cup? 0:29
Saul goodman after the events of breaking bad.
Plot twist: he's actually somebody.
Slipping Jimmy with a machine gun is like a Chimp with a law degree! XD

❤️❤️❤️
hamlam bebeba bele beleba bel eeeeeeee bootttsssssssss.
It says a lot about John Wick that someone is stepping up to the plate to establish that level of gunplay and choreography, as well as athleticism stuntman bravery, is something that needs to be continued.  I hope this is as awesome as the trailer!
The Continental Presents: What If?  "John Wick had a family"

Ohhhhh shit next wick is coming

John Wick meets A History of Violence, And I Love It!!!!

In alternate universe Odenkirk got the role on the Office as Michael Scott. And this movie got Steve carell.

It's like Malcolm in the Middle and Taken had a well edited offspring.
Better Call Wick
That fu**n nobody,,,,,,, is John Wick's father.

Impotent suburban dad power fantasy.
In theaters only...HA!  These old Hollywood studio farts sound like the rotary telephone salesmen, the blockbuster video managers, the newspaper editors...you’re time has passed.  Adapt or die.  Streaming isn’t going away...deal with it.

Before Trailer: Heisenberg: It's over when I say over.   After Trailer: Heisenberg: It's over when NOBODY says it's over.
Sasta John wick
Saul Goodman/Jimmy breaking bad
when Jimmy said that he was going take care of it by himself, he wasn't lying...
*John Wick has entered the chat*
This isn't a movie for liberals, right? I mean, there are guns and people killing each other.

Ahhhh yeah. This is John wick lol

Don't tell if this guy is in the same universe with john wick
Producer of John Wick that's enough for me to watch this movie
Is he in the John Wick universe?
no one: nobody:
Is this going to be set in the Wick universe? Is it possible we might get Reeves vs Odenkirk?
They played this trailer during another youtube vid. Not only did I not skip it, but I'm here now. So...thats a good sign. Oh and the only issue I had when I first saw it was when he said "I'm gonna mess you up"...glad they corrected that.
Looks good.
This movie fuckedup
From the same writer of john wick and director from hardcore henry... What else can ruin that?
Saul Goodman other life
John wick dog and now cat
Let's go!
Nice to see Kevin Costner with another movie!
1:43 lmao, dude just walked in without checking his right, what a moron
john wick, family friendly christmas version
I guess they need to call Saul Goodman
Looks like a happy fun time!
pretty bad ass🤣
I really hope this movie is in the same universe with John Wick, and then they'll meet & team up...
Is this guy RAMBO?????
Sorry but I just don't buy him as a trained killer.
Saul quits being a lawyer and started to become a hit man
оо ее...

Saul Goodman is changing into Badman✊ Vera Maari ...Vera Maari....🔥🔥
Vera Maari ...Vera Maari....🔥🔥
This is officially the film I'm most excited about
What's the name of the theme song?
IMPECUNIOUS Having little or no money (impecunious) is the state of 90% of the world’s population. The poverty line is officially defined as people who are earning less than one U.S. dollar a day. Impecuniousness is relative – depending on our tastes, disposition, culture, wants and desires, state of mind. Living from hand to mouth could be considered poverty but people living hand to mouth can have a house, a car, cable light water Internet gas bills – things people who can’t find food would love to ‘complain’ about. Prosperity pastors like to say that JESUS was rich. But rich people in ancient Jewry rode donkeys and horses, had servants, mansions, and fine robes. JESUS’ wealth came from the reality that He owned everything. As Christians we own everything too because a share of infinite wealth is infinity too.
We want Better Call Saul SEASON 6
What’s the soundtrack please
Nobody is better than John Wick John Wick is second to Nobody      I'm not here to start a war between both it's a pun on the name
No one: Literally No One: Nobody:
My lawyer Saul Goodman told me to tell you “I’m Nobody”
He’s gonna need to Call Saul👍
From BETTER CALL SAUL to Mr.Nobody🔥🔥🔥
John wick:Mid-life crisis
It's so amazing to see Kim survive BCS to have children with Jimmy
Bob Odenkirk looks absolutely phenomenal in this!
John wick :- Dog  Mr nobody :- Kitty cat
John wick if he still has a wife and a family
it's all good man
Nobody:  Absolutely Nobody:  Breaking Bad: BETTER CALL SAUL 🤪
Not used to a soft comedic actor known to play Saul Goodman to be playing an action “badass”.
I’m just so happy the movies done and we know it’s coming out :)
When things happen like this, Better call Saul.
Ohhhhh yesssssss

So John Wick with a family
*Takes hit off bong* Duuuuuude. What if...like...a comedic actor played John Wick?
Basically how John Wick would be, if his wife didn't die
D🔥pe, S🔥lid and Authentic 💪🐲💯😎

This movie is not even out yet and I'm already. waiting on part two three and four. so can somebody make another.... NOBODY.... PLEASE‼️
What’s the song called?
Looks like a bomb you all are tripping. “They messed with my family and you just don’t do that!” “I use to work with some dangerous people” foh
They are so similar....I thought it was actor Jackie Earle Haley but Mr.Nobody got the same vibe as Rorschach ;) I will enjoy it!
Waiting for a deepfake of keanu on this one.
Nobody exterminated Saul Goodman!
wow john wick uncle hehe
"you look like shit" "yeah, _Die Hard_ shit"
That was a hell of a trailer mannn🔥
I bet there's a sequel called somebody!
"... i was an AUDITOR..." - - who can handle handheld firearms/weapons and close-contact combat... just saying by:: #famousdinolaya
I'd like to see him cross paths with John Wick at some point
Everybody wan be John wick
What's this song in it
I feel I judge a book by its cover seeming the picture of him and thinking better call Saul. But after finally watching the trailer this could be good.
What language are those vocals ?
John wick universe just got better.
Oh look, another movie about an old guy who’s had enough
Bob Odenkirk is the new Bruce Willis
Song plz?😍🎶🙌✨
Hollywood has been out of ideas for quite some time.
AWESOME!!! Less Dialogue More Punches!!
wantwantwantwantWANT

Jesus, Saul went rogue after Breaking Bad...
Not all heroes wear capes. Some cuss and kick the shit out of bad guys

sad to see an actor of this talent reduced to more computer game gun fetish garbage
it would be cool if they could link it to the John wick universe, or have some easter egg somehow lol
I'm Nobody I KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOURE SLIPPIN JIMMY
The way he punched thru the car window I know it’s gonna be a good movie.

AAAEEEE FINALMENTE UM FILME DE AÇÃO NOVO PARA CURAR O EFEITO DESSA QUARENTENA DESGRAÇADA...
Bob Odenkirk doing THIS? Fucking awesome.
I hope there's an end credits seen where he's approached by John Wick to help take on the circle in John Wick 4
After to much fight, it's all good man 😁😅😂
Everybody gangster until they steal the kitty cat bracelet
does john wick show up at the end?
I honestly didn't think there would be something to look forward to in 2021, but I can see I was wrong! This looks kickass!
Just another violence praising movie
This is how you do a good trailer! ❤️
Would be cool if this took place in the same universe as John Wick.
It's John Wick's brother: Bob Wick.
So HE WAS amigo del cartel...
Nobody:   Me: I would do the same for my daughter’s kitty cat bracelet.
Son: *you look like shit dad* 😏  Dad: *you should see the other guy* 🥱
Wow, seriously? This looks great 👌👍
Saul would be proud
"I'm nobody" (cat eating from a can in front of him)
Hell yes
I'm sorry but this looks ridiculous. I just can't take Saul Goodman in a macho role seriously.
'But does he use a pencil to take out his target?' - John Wick
artillery arthur goes jhon whick
*Glad They Used Kitty Kat, imagine Him Saying "Give me the God Damn Pu$$y Bracelet" Instead*
he looks like ryan renolds playing deadpool, but he never got powers and a suit and was just a badass, and i love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=43s
i WOOSH a MF would take my kitty cat bracelet

This trailer, it's all good man.
Call an ambulance call an ambulance!!!!..... But not for me 😈

I normally don't get wowed by trailers but this looks amazing. It's got that John Wick vibe.
Indian copy coming soon for Oscar 🤣
Hitman brought out of retirement to ass kick.  Denzel and Keanu will be proud.
Looks awesome
This is breaking bad
"In Theaters only" You sure about that?
i see another liam neeson in the making 😊
This is what happens when you push Saul, over the edge.
0:39 just wanted to point out the legendary Christopher Llyod is in this.
You, simplement, shouldn’t, have stolen, the kitty cat bracelet.
CLOSED CAPTION?
They need to stop to John Wicking around...
Is that a Wexler McGill thermos?
better not steal the goddamn kitty cat bracelet
This is John wicks impossible mission
When you order John Wick from “Wish” app 😂
Am i the only one who think this dude looks like Kevin Costner ?
Bob Odenkirk is one of my favorite actors so I am here for it!
Would've been better if it was Gus Fring.
you dont steal kitty cat bracelets..monsters
So a cross between The Accountant and John Wick? Take my money now!!!!!!!
Trust me, he is one of Winston's people
This looks really good.
Ok but did anybody see that kill bill reference
I like it. Absolutely love the Actor(Saul), don't even know his real name. Just hoped he'd be a real nobody and not an ex-special unit whatsoever guy. Would be more original than John Wick in old. Gonna watch it anyway.
By the same person that wrote John Wick in case people were wondering.
John Wick vs Nobody confirmed?
SPOILER............    He is the Lawyer of JOHN WICK
John Wick's funny uncle lol, this looks amazingly fun I can't wait
🔥🔥🔥
This might get me into a movie theater.
This is the alternate reality where John Wicks wife never dies...
Wouldn't it be cool if Heisenberg's one of the bad guys?...fingers cross.
This definitely looks like fun
Nice, you gave us the entire movie in a trailer. now I don't need to go watch it.
this looks so stupid
Серебряков антагониста играет? Нормально
Please tell me he and John Wick team up at some point.
GIVE ME THE GAWD DAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET!!!
This is just a funny older john wick
This looked good for the first 20 seconds then got corny
Am very very very exited for this film .......

Looks like  the movie Red. The one with Bruce Willis.
Better call Saul next season?
Mike is so proud of you Saul
Now i know who takes down Lalo Salamanca.
I love this- Odenkirk as an action star. Makes sense as a professional hitman masquerading as an Everyman.
Ugly actor don’t work

Saul 12 years after he called to buy vacuum cleaner model Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro Model 60.
Starring: Kevin Costner
I AM READY

хоть где-то Палю пизды вломят
Hope nobody and John wick get a movie together.
Ilya Naishuller has already become synonymous with high-quality blockbuster.💣💥
Nobody...Nobody.......Nobody does it better😘💋💋💋
"You’re not nobody" "I was last night"
This looks great!
I feel like I watched the entire movie already
Until someone proves otherwise, I'm just assuming this happens in the John Wick universe.
What is the name of this song? It's so catchy. Please, somebody tell us.
Does anyone else not give a f about the John wick story line after the 1st movie and only watch for the action and violence
Сол Гудман, Серебряков и Паль? Компания неожиданная.
Voice recall Breaking Bad
"It's not what you did son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to."  "Who? That fuckin nobody?"
How i missed movie trailer
Сол Гудмен, Алексей Серебряков... Могли бы выпустить и раньше, чтобы хоть как-то оправдать 2020-й.
Me: who's better than John wick... Le everyone: NOBODY, NOBODY DOES IT BETTER😈
In theaters only????
In Theaters Feb 26.. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Finally something awesome to watch after Covid!!
i Can't wait! I love Bob! (To The Producers and actors in this film ignore the negative comments! "Hater's Gonna Hate!" ~:o)
From the thumbnail I thought it was a parody of John Wick
Wish  Keanu Reeves as Nobody..
Nobody does it better ❤️👍
It'saaal BAD mannn
Plot twist he is john vick’S brother
Good one
i didn't ask for hot odenkirk but i am thankful for it
Nice to see this guy doing other stuff and this look pretty good.
I know a guy who knows a guy. He is "Nobody" 😜
Seems like Nobody was trained by Wick, Mike and Heisenberg over the past 12 years
This movie looks badass!!!!
Is this hinting to a John Wick Cinematic Universe? That'd be cool!
Impressed
Copy of John wick
I already want to see John Wick working together with Nobody

BRUH THIS LOOKS HYPE

Terence hill better cameo..
John Wick mixed with The Equalizer  :D I take it !

Saul Wick
Oh my lord! I fking want to see this movie so bad! Please don't force us to watch on movie theaters, make an option to see it online too! I want to pay to see it, just don't count that David39 will go away ok?
Im actually really excited to see him in an action role like this

*Alternate title:* Better Maul Saul
Nobody does it better 👄👄👄👄👄😂😂😂😂
Was that a Wexler-Mcgill Mug??????
Heard that they were once considering creating a john wick universe. If that's the case then I want to see this guy either fighting or teaming up with john and the atomic blonde
Is this too similar to John wick?
Is that Looper's gold bars?
John Wick X Nobody 2022
The parallels to John Wick aside. I think this right up my alley. Looking forward to it.
History Of Violence remake
Anybody else notice the Wexler-McGill thermos he was drinking out of
"We had a hit with John Wick. What next?" "How about we do a movie about a retired assassin who gets pushed too far by criminals and breaks out his stash of firearms to go on a killing spree?" "It's risky, but it just might work."
What happens when you cross over  breaking_bad    X    John_wich
BCS season 5?
Fireeeee
Nobody and wick should team up they can deal with the situation of the dog and the kitty cat bracelet.
Better Call Saul gone wrong
Wick john the first
Finally
Yea I liked it better when it was called "a history of violence "
Sorry but you will be saul godman for all of us forever!!!!
Mixture of john wick and joker
🤢🤮
Can’t wait for somebody
He is John Weak.
Nobody     -    anyone !     ..edit - just  watched it   twice  in a row   good movie Trinity  spagetti   western      my name is  Nobody    .
So, it's home alone, but R rated?
Nobody:   Nobody
Saul Goodman is tired of your shit.
Poor man's john wick! lmaooo And thanks for showing the whole movie hahahah
(NOBODY)  Starring John OdenWick.
(NOBODY)   Starring Bob OdenWick
Is that guy the young version of Nobody in Fast & Furious 🤨
Yup, definitely seeing this.
The joker
slippin jimmy having some kansas city shuffle
When you don't afford John Wick "Better call Saul".
Bob Odenwick  In  NOBODY
Soo a John Wick remake?
Bob Odenwick  Is  NOBODY
John Wicks Papa
John Wick version 2.0
Nobody  Starring:Bob OdenWick
Excellent
Nobody nobody does it better....
Music❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every squad got the Bob Odenkirk
John Wick in his old age...
He wasn't exactly the Boogey Man. He was the one you call to lawyer up the Boogey Man.
This poster look like johnwick😍😍😍
This is just the beginning.  Mark my words.  Odenkirk will be fighting Vin Diesel in Fast 10.
What is this the John wick for senior citizens!!!
Being screwed over by Walter White has really gotten to Saul.
Even the poster is similar to John wick's chapter 2. I hate cinematic universes, but if this is part of a john wick universe, I'm in.
Ok now this is epic
Me after watching this trailer:  "This looks s'all good man. "
Does anyone know what the original version of the song in the backround is?
John Wick beating movie
"THIS FILM LOOKS S'ALL GOOD, MAN." ...
"THIS TRAILER LOOKS S'ALL GOOD, MAN." ...
"I LOOK LIKE A YOUNG SAUL GOODMAN DRESSED AS JOHN WICK." ...
"YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU SEE FLIPPIN' JIMMY." ...
"I'M GONNA BE A DAMN GOOD, JOHN WICK, AND PEOPLE ARE GONNA KNOW ABOUT IT."
Being screwed over by Walter White has really broken Saul.
I'm in
Hopefully people will see how good of an actor Bob Odenkirk is and will start watching the underrated masterpiece that is, Better Call Saul.
I am Groot
This is basically if John wick started a family
In theaters ? I thought theaters were a thing of the past
Never underestimate the power of a father....I repeat never🥺🥺🥺
Looks Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is why Hollywood makes sequels.
The trailer doesn't do justice to the director. A millisecond on a screen with his name at the end? For real?
His reflexes are a little slower than John wick but a little quicker than Bryan mills.😜
Неужели искромётно будут мочить серебрякова? ой вэй
Cops:"When there's a crime we can't solve" .  "You Better Call" .      "Saul"
ah i think its season two of " john wick"
Oh no. Looks like the liberal Hollywood hypocrites are at it again. Making movies with all those scary guns in them because making money is more important than Alyssa Milano's feelings. I can't wait to watch it!!!
I'm a simple guy, I get in trouble I better call Saul
The movie for edgy soyboys
Must watch
But we know he is Saul Goodman🤝
Next boogeyman
S'all good man.
Simply- Wow
This will gonna connect with John Wick.
Saul reloaded
What song it is?
He might need a dust filter for a hoover max extract pressure pro podel 60
Anybody knows the name of this soundtrack????😍😍 Goddamn its been running on my mind the whole day😭😭
Nobody, absolutely nobody:   "I am nobody"
I like he is more like Bruce willis than Bruce willis
So the guy from Mr Show is an action star now....   Lets go.
This guy deserves an Oscar
"Who the F are you" Saul: " I'm just a Nobody" Cat: I confirm dis NIGGA is Nobody how dare he give ME dis junk food "ptooey, then proceeds to eat the junk food with gusto"
This is so NOT Saul...
John Wick called Saul 🤣🤣
Multi-punch man...
😳😳😮😮🤯 This looks amazballs!!
John Wicks thumbnail: Has guns all around him  Nobody's thumbnail: Has fists all around him
I'm in. That kitty cat bracelet line was hilarious.
2014: You Better Call John Wick to take out the Boogey Man  2021: Better Call Saul to do that
So John Wick has a family and lives a normal life till somebody steals his daughter's kitty cat bracelet. I am totally down for this
It’s all good man!!!!
Rainbow Six Siege:  Tatcher retires.
Something interesting.... , 🔥
1:09 the way the music is syncing up here... now THAT is how you make a trailer
soul badman
I need the music in spotify pleaseee 😭💗
Whenever you in shit.. you know whom to call
This Is a GTA movie!
Must be a part of John Wick universe maybe a organization that is at par with the continental.
R.E.D. meets John Wick
Better call nobody.
this movie has no plot
Nobody, nobody, nobody does it better
better call saul!!!
This movie have all the testosterone I need, I like it.
when did saul goodman become john wick
Awesome 👍 Bollywood want to learn from this,, how make MOVIES with unique content..
Is this a joke?
saulllllllllllll
WTF?
plot twist : he is john wick's dad
Ok
Holy shittt😂💪👌🤘
What's the song?
He better call Saul! Oh come on, I had to do that
Walt : 😳
Damn. Don't fuck with Saul Goodman.
Saul just try to solve your problem. He's nobody
Awesome to see that Saul Goodman becomes a badass!
Better not call Saul ?
What if saul goodman is john wick with a family?
John Wich got some competition
Nobody :  . . . . . . . . .   .I'm say nobody then y r u come down..
They didn't call Saul, so he took things personally.
Soul Goodman 💜
Bob?
THIS is the bob odenkirk we all want and deserve
Now we're talking
Marshall boss
Bob Odenkirk
Eh, the whole "Badass old/family man" Trope is kinda cringe after 2-3 movies.   It feels like the writers/directors are just living vicariously through their work.
I was into it until the spy/hitman twist. I think the idea of a social satire where the protagonist has to deal with the fallout of a home invasion and deal with his suppressed violent urges/desire to appear masculine would have been a far more interesting film. The trailers gives the impression that the movie was fliting with an interesting concept, but decided to go a more conventional route with it instead. What they basically did was took A History of violence, took away the interesting aspects of it (the characterization and grim/somber tone) and turned it into a more marketable action/comedy.
Like a johnwick style but nobody awesome intresting  more details 👍🔥
Saul: I know a guy who knows a guy The guy      Nobody!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have located The Nobody
John Wick: Nobody Coming 2024   Plot: Nobody and John Wick team up! No other details are needed.  Me: TAKE MY MONEY!
Much needed at this boring time.
That's Saul Goodman after his witness protection
Awesome!!
He's Jimmy McGill 😂😂
John wick. If his wife didn't die.
Imagine nobody vs jonhvick vs equalizer
Background music is Lit🔥so the trailer
Great move Universal Pictures to release this amazing movie 'only in theatres'😎
Tell me we didn't see all the action scenes. Please.
Better call nobody?
Seems like Jimmy changed his job  nd join the badass group😎
Absolute mind boggling 👌👌👌.
Atlast, some good fucking movie.
big reveal : Odenkirk is John Wick 20 years from now
Is this in the same universe?
"In theaters only" Covid: Yea....we'll see.
John Wick Universe hell yah🔥
Getting some Falling Down vibes from this.
It's not what you did son its who you did it to
Daaaamn... Ol' Bob's come a long way since Mr Show.
Wow, an action movie in an era of virus
This looks boring and generic
"That fkin "Nobody" is John Wick !"
I wish this goes in the same universe as jhon wick.
I already love this movie so much
Amazing 😂😂😂😁
Netflix movie polar copy anu😂😂😂😂
This is how Hollywood movies look and our fucking bollywood 😂😂
Saul Goodman turns into John Wick? I’m IN!!! Give Odenkirk The Oscar now 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Awesome
Doc Brown
Jhon wick final mission : 2:25
I'd like to see him vs John Wick.
wow love this
That fuc**** Nobody is BabaYaga
daughter: they stole my kitty cat bracelet... father: opens arsenal of weaponry hidden in the closet
NOBODY asked for this, but everybody wanted this...we just didn't know
Totally John wick copy
Dadwick
This looks like a silly version of A History of Violence.
We need you to really sell it...and action: "Give me the goddamn Kitty Kat bracelet"
From the producer of john wick Me - well, i can see that one
movie seems trash only reason to watch would be odenkirk
This looks good, actions and his comedy will make this another franchise you wait and see!!!
That alley, that bus, this is Toronto isnt it?
If you have a problem, Better call Nobody
Never screw with someone who chooses to be nobody.
Yes Please.
Holy cow, this looks amazeballs! Can't wait to see it😎
That Fucking Nobody is   John Wick
dont call 911. better call Saul!!
that was cool as f...
So this is a John Wick movie with a kitty cat bracelet instead of a dog? I'm in.
From the directors of John Wick.... Yeah I can see that
Boss- "What happened here?" Henchman- "I don't know, but there was No'Body'."
John Wick PG13
Dayuum I was gonna say he Better Call Saul but from the looks of it he needs Nobody for help
Jon wick brother?
is this the guyz who knows a guy who knows a guy?
when mr saul goodman become saul goodwick
Its great to see bob openkirk getting his own starring roll film.
This fucking nobody...is nobody...
this is my type of movie, a low profiler mc
He looks like Bruce willis alike
Omg!!  I so want to see this! This looks amazing and funny!
Same premise as A History of Violence, with more black comedy. I'm on board.
Stale.
Yeah ! They turn the last season of Better Call Saul into a Movie !🙌
Better call... nobody
After being a lawyer and getting a new identity. Really is a nobody except the danger! :D
The delivery of 'don't call 911' was very Keanu. Definitely intentional
Saul breaking bad
OMFG *3 Saul goodman wildin
John Wick : they killed my dog Nobody : give me my kitty kat bracelet
Every basic movie wow
After watching MN story .
oh hells nah not the fkn kitty cat bracelet >:( !!!!
Reminds me of john wick
It's damn good, ಜೈ ಕನ್ನಡ
This movie poses the question: What if A History of Violence was a comedy?
don't call 911, it's all good man
It's all good man!
Nobody:      Nobody: Almost kills a man for stealing a cat's bracelet.
You better call Saul
From solving cases and settling issues to becoming a person “who’s gonna fuck you up?”  Bob obenkirk, love for you, 1000 times.😍
😍❤️🔥
MN squad ❤️❤️
Damn it's gonna be rocking 🔥
Background song ??
Love this kind a.....
if anyone is wondering the song is "just a jigaloo" by louis prima
Better call Saul 😁
Dayyymm
They better call Saul
Mr Goodman has come a long way.
this movie is awesome! but to be honest they should pick a younger actor.
He is the boogeyman John Wick was asked to kill and once upon a time this guy killed 3 men with a condom.. with a freaking condom
Oh yes bring it on😎
Sooo...John Wick if John Wick were a family man.  Sure, I’m down.
New killer, got a family, going for a cat, drives a Dodge Challenger   So another one will be someone who is still dating a guy/girl, got no pets and drives a Camaro?
Who knew Saul was living a double life this whole time.
Saul isn't goodman anymore
John wick: Like Father, Like son
Better not call Mansell
So this is what Saul's post-Heisenberg life looks like
Better Call Saul final season have to be this good
Jimmy you've changed a lot
I know a guy, who knows a guy, who knows another guy
First it was dog now it's kitty cat..
Artillery Arthur!
Was that song in hindi 😂😂
Saul godman var nasıl kötü olabilir ki efsanee
**Or new Better call saul movie     Better call but Saul: it can get better
Never in a million years I can believe this is BoB Odenkirk
Much better copy of John Wick than what Netflix did
John Wick, Nobody and Deadpool colab, please.
Nobody's family to him: Whose number is 911?  Nobody: Don't call it. It's Deadpool's number.  David Lich : yes, it is.
This is something I would love to watch!
This fucking trailer just blew my fucking mind. Saul Goodman go fuck everybody.
is that jimmy? and fucking mike? c'mon
Too much cool stuff.
Song name pls?
Looks stupid.
It will be most waited film for me in 2021.
Who else here After watching #MumbikerNikhil Story
John Wick  living in suburbia
Evil goons really should stop messing with people's pets. John's dog, Saul's daughter's kitty...what next? Samuel L. Jackson's Goldfish? But still, looks like an entertaining movie.
О Серебряков
John Wick: Because of a f*ck*n' dog. Nobody (dad body): BECAUSE Of A GODDAMM KITTY CAT BRACELET!
Assistant of John Wick.
Saul spent to much time with Walt
At this point. Might as well put it in the same universe as John wick
“Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet” *best line ever*
Now we are talking!!!! Awesome!!!
-he's a nobody -that nobody is......
Yeah February 26 is a bit of a stretch
Public transportation, turning nobodies into anti-heroes....
Hope this is in wick universe
So this is pretty much the plot of john wick 3 if you substitute former auditor with assassin
YES
A John wick spinoff?
Please release in Hindi also
When did Saul learn to fight?
I didn't know Saul Goodman is a great fighter.
Finally Saul is becoming what Walter White has become a long ago
John Wick Daddy version
So this is a Equalizer but with Bob (Saul Goodman) basically.... I can dig it.... I love Bob as a actor so to play a part like this, I think it's dope... course I'm still praying for a Equalizer Part 3 with Denzel...
So it's John wick with a bit of joker
Never seen Bob in an action movie but I'm happy I will now😁😁😁
"Mom can we get John Wick?" "No we have John Wick at home"  John Wick at home:
I wonder if the action is gonna be synced to the music in the movie, like Baby Driver? Because it is synced in this trailer and i really hope the movie is like this too. I've been watching 1:02 and 1:42 over and over cuz this kind of thing is so satisfying.
Better Call Saul!
Saul Wick
John wick finally a worthy opponent
When Saul Goodman's had enough of the cartel
Jimmy McGill?
finally a superhero without any superpowers or some fancy gadgets
Better call Saul has become John Wick 🤣🤣🤣
presenting you the another side of saul Goodman :)
It's like A History of Violence punched John Wick.
Oh fuck yeah
don't  call 911,so fucking cool.
John wick 144p
The John Wick we wanted
Once there were three people Somebody;everybody and nobody. one day somebody got angry and killed everybody.watching it nobody called the police and said somebody killed everybody.the police asked who are you..he replied i am NOBODY...
I hope that for this movie Nobody has different fighting styles and rather than being more graceful like John wick he simply takes the hits and does more back
Aha awesome, it's like they took aspects of the portrayal of the Joker in the last couple live action portrayals and decided to make a heroic stand through the character.
What is this?!?
Bus fight reminds me of Equalizer.
“Nobody............Does It Better”
Better call saul !
Who's here after MN's story 😂😂😂😂
Nobody : Nobody : You don’t do that,  give the kitty cat bracelet back!
John Wick Sr.?
Starring Bob Odenkirk as Liam Neeson
ngl looks super duper frickin dickin awesome mayyynnneeee
Who is after mn story
JOHN WICK UNIVERSE!!!
It's clear that Saul Goodman has made a few career changes since Breaking Bad.
That explains why Better call Saul is on hiatus. Good for him anyway 👌
OMG🙄 Bob odenkirk ( better call saul) am Glad to see him in this movie What a trailer ❗ So waiting for this film  experience 💯
It's just me, or the thumbnail looks like the John Wick's póster?
Saul’s alternate reality in Belize
I haven't  been this excited over a trailer that's not a franchise in a while
Huh, I really want to watch this
Chuk was right, Jimmy could not be a 'real' lawyer!
This looks like a very generic, unsubtle version of A History of Violence
Wow ... now they announce movies for 2026. Hope my Theatre will be open until then.
Better call saul!!!
John Wick and Better Call Saul fans: hmmm interesting
The Accountant after Retirement.
BETTER CALL JACK  REACHER
"Better punch Saul"
This is definitely a step up from bb and call saul. The only shitty thing is...."IN THEATERS ONLY"  good luck with that...welcome to the Corona world.
Goodman ain't a goodman no more
I am hear after "Porno Gill" Ep Curn YE.
No he wasnt an auditor he was a lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico
It's like John wick with Family 😂

John Wick ultra pro max
Choice of music and actor is 'French fat chef finger kiss' muaah!
A serious comparison to John Wick....🤔🤔🤔... I’m seeing it anyway. 😄😁😄😀 I can always use more John Wick stuff!!! LOOKS AMAZING!

Never underestimate the power of a common man 😀😀
Joker + John wick = Nobody
Literally John Wick. But I still wanna see it
You see that Salamancas???

No scope triple kill badge!
This is going to be amazing

In some parallel universe where Saul is Heisenberg XD
He looks like Saul Goodman
Anybody know a good lawyer he can hire?
"In theaters only"  LMFAO, whose idea was that?
He was the 2nd choice for michael scott from the office

This looks amazing I love it
Better call saulll 😂😂😂😂

This feels like a parody of the John wick movies! His car, the cat, his retirement. Even the thumbnail 😂😂😂😂
"For 12 years I worked for very dangerous people." Sure you did... Sure you did.
Its just another cliché like all the action movies
Basically John Wick 5.........after john moves on in 4th movie
Saul Goodman gets tired of hiding and decide to be John Wick lol
Okay Saul Goodman.... this aint you
So they're remaking John Wick without the dog.
Fckk yeahhh... don’t piss Saul goodman
😱😱It's Saul Wick 🤣🤣💪👍
Was that the "Wick Flip" I just saw? 2:53 ;)
Epic!
I think the name comes in fast and furious film
Don't call 911, just call Saul.
Saul always comes with something worth watching...
He needed that kitty cat bracelet badly
the first minute looked interesting then it turned to another generic dad is a superagent action movie
I would Love To see a Crossover of JOHN WICK and NOBODY !!!
what if this is one big dream , saul Goodman tired of getting bullied by drug dealers so after watching "the accountant " imagines he's a vigilante.
SAUL GOODMAN IS BACK
Saul Goodman really stepped up his game
Saul
I fucking like it❤️❤️❤️
Nobody: Don't call 911. Wife: Then? Nobody: Better Call Saul.
It's Saul Goodman lady!
Saul Goodman
So this is his life after going out of the grid for Mr. White.
Saul going ape-shit.
holy shit......pumped the heart...will be waiting for this one. 👻👻
If John Wick had a family.
1:33 Don't call 911, call Saul Goodman.
*Should i call the FBI and tell them that i found John Wick Sr. ???*
This shit looks goooood
Don't call Nobody
Most of these YouTube comedians who try to be funny in the comments on almost every video would end up getting booed off the stage due to the cringe inducing halfwit sorry excuse for comedy that they possess.  Trying too hard to be funny often results in not being funny at all....
But music is k not so good 🥺
Nobody does it better than HIM
its all good man (Saul Goodman)
Nice to see Saul Goodman in action
Saul Goodman, r u ok?
That fuckin' nobody is Saul Goodman.
Modern take on " A history of violence ".
Паль! Красавчег! Далеко же вас забросило) Круто, что крутые актеры таки замечаются крутыми людьми
Mikeee
iam a Nobody
Well this looks fucking awesome
better call saul???? DAMN
i thought he would be just saul goodman u know one of them actors who cant escape a character but this looks fucking awesome
Breaking Saul
Just dont kill that Cat..
It's fuckin insane
Interesting..........
I would really love to see this movie take place in John Wick's universe 🤩
Don't call 911 but better call saul 😃🤣
Alternate Title : "Saul strikes back!"
Arthur Hopes what are you doing??
Superb trailer . I'm from india
Seems like the same premise of John Wick
SAUL NEW LIFE!  BETTER CALL SAUL!!
Don't call 911....better call Saul 😄
He “Better Call Saul”🤣🤣
Omg.
Is it a spoof movie of John Wick?
Thought it was going to be a discount Joker at first
Better call Nobody.
Looks like john wick but loved John wick so I am happy for more like it
Kinda reminds me of Taken.
Ngl looks like a Batman trailer
yep i m going ....fq i dont care if i get corona ...only the good one
Hope he’s got a good lawyer 😉
Remainder set
crossover between john wick and the equalizer...
Is this what happened to him after breaking bad?  Cool!
"Better call for Saul" 😎😆
That's every working class man dream .
Wow. Now this is fire
I was wondering, is this by any chance linked to the John Wick universe? because, I would very much like if the answer is "yes". Also Awesome trailer.
I’ll watch anything with Bob Odenkirk in it,  That man is so talented!
no gender politics no virtue signaling just a nice popcorn movie. Thank you thats all we ask
well we need John Wick/Nobody crossover
gus and heisenberg would be hit scared
Damn! I want to see this movie right now :(
John Wick vs Nobody will be the most ambitious crossover in superhero movie history.
wow
Better call saul..😂😂😂
So he’s John Wick, 10 years later. Regardless, this looks pretty damn good. Surprisingly good, actually.
Nobody :  Nobody :
Would be cooler if it was same universe as John wick
Song?
Better Call Nobody
Russians are played by russians, feels like it's gonna be a good movie
Never thought Saul would kick ass
2:38 OOOOOH BABY A TRIPLE!
Johnwick's teacher Nobody
That f*cking nobody is boogeyman
Saul Goodman can you take Mike down ?
Better Call Nobody 😑
Илья молодец, наших в Голливуд тащит, успехов им всем !
“Don’t call 911, BETTER CALL SAUL”
Saul Wick
Nobody is going to interesting but john wick already reached one level...
I am going see it......🎉
Looks like a great film.. but by golly.. what the heck has happened with trailer music these days? That music was just awful. Didn’t fit the trailer at all.  Even drowned out some of the dialogue.
I'm so confused. At first i thought it's a parody of wick cuz odenkirk is a funny guy. Then it continued with the serious tone and i realized it's a serious movie just a wick ripoff. Then he said you took my daughter's goddamn kitty cat bracelet and then i was confused further. But I'm interested.
Plot twist: this movie is a sequel to Breaking bad. Saul is now on his path of redemption. He's gonna fight back... . . . . Alright I know that was Lame.. but.
This is the movie I have to watch..
All the people watching this comment : Nobody : Guess who's talking now , bitches.
Biggest crossover - John wick and nobody
Everytime he opens his mouth I hear *Jimmy McGill* . Shit bro..
This looks great! Saul in action!
How nice of universal to upload the whole movie
Ofcourse there's a pet reference! What was i thinking?
"don't call 911"...better call Saul Edit: well, scrolling to the comments below, I realised mine is not an original one. Several others had the same reaction when he said - don't call 911...😃
Bring it on!!!!!
This is Mr.Wick but in christmas movie
Old John Wick?
Villain: Nobody can stop me! Nobody: Exactly!
Plot Twist- Being fed up of breaking bad's aftermath, Gene Takavic chooses to change his identity again &becomes Nobody
Somehow I get a bit of a Max Payne vibe (the game character not the movie bullcrap one) from this dude.
Wow.
Ok nice 👍
This looks like a John Wick spinoff, even the thumbnail is similar to  the John Wick 2 poster
Is this the same guy who plays Rorshack from Watchmen or is he the main guy in "My name is EarL?"
Is he John wicks uncle or something ??🙄
Wtf is this?
Pot Twist: This is Saul Goodman.
Saul changed after season 5...
First half looked good then it just turned into a mindless action flick...
Holy fuckin shit that was LIT!🔥
Everybody Gangsta Until 1:35 🤫🤜
If john wicks wife don't died  few years later !!
Bootleg john wick
Police: who the fuck are you? Saul: I'm the one who knocks
AWESOME!!!!!
saul snapped
Why does hearing nobody always reminds me of Arya stark 😛😂
John wick can easily destroy him
Better call John Wick
Impressive!!!! Fun!!!!!
That looks better than it has any right to.

“Give me the god damn kitty bracelet “
Saul Badman
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Nobody: abalaubalaymala
You better call Saul
jeez!!! who would have thought Saul Goodman could kick so much ass. i bet Walter White is kicking himself now! breaking bad would have been totally different
Its like a john wick part one revival Just with more drama in it.
Nobody will fuck up john wick. Cant argue with me can you?
Better call Saul
Thumbnail shows Nobody getting punched from all directions.Reminds me of John Wick poster in which he was surrounded by guns from all directions.Now I see why?Thank you comment section
For 12 years I used to work for a guy called Heisenberg.
He better call Saul
This is basically a history of violence but from the director of John wick
Saul Goodman decides to break bad
Saul Badman
Bob = Liam + Denzel + Keanu .... Yes I am in for this
If I don't see a movie with this guy and John Wick fucking the whole world up, I will die unhappy.
John wick , equalizer, nobody, gang up in avengers
Christopher Lloyd!!
Everyone just think about it, in real life i can see him being more of  an assassin as in to someone like Keanu reeves cause he will obviously stand out.  He just look like a normal guy, and i guess a part of an assassin's job is to look normal and not stand out.
Next up: Nobody and John Wick take down the High table
*Bob Odenk... SHUT UP and TAKE MY MONEY*
saul goes rough
This movie looks like its gonna be dopppeeee...
John wick who?
Damn i am invested in this movie. One hell of a trailer.
Серебряков и Паль, лол

If the movie does well (which I hope it does) I demand a crossover with John Wick in his next movie, the two of them, kicking ass
nice
That looks awesome.
It's all good man🤗🔥
Boom baby

👍
This is what you call a trailer
Batman: Arrow :: John Wick: Nobody
That's kickboxer vengeance actor in that bus getting his ass kicked ??
That's my movie dude...
0:41 shit I had to rewind back cause for a moment i thought that was Jonathan banks
They need to stop syncing action with the music, it's getting cliche.
best action trailer in a while
There should be and award for "Best Movie Trailer"
He'd become Heisenberg/John Wick
Bootleg John wick
Better call Saul ... 😅
Loving this trailer watch it 5 times waiting to release movie
Better Call Saul😍😍
Alright now.. this will be epic!
When the blue pill slowly turns the other color

DON'T CALL 911 BETTER CALL SAUL!!!
Ngl, never thought I’d ever get to see Bob Odenkirk play a badass
wait a minute ，is this the lawyer?
" For 12 years, i've worked for very dangerous people " Aight, back to work Saul.
This is actually set in the JOHN Wick universe
John wick be like--I noticed u copied my style..
That no body , is John Wick..........
Saul goodman thinking hes mike lol.
Plot twists Saul from Better Call Saul gets himself out of prison
Good to see someone other than Liam Neeson or Bruce Willis 🙄
super, another trailer that shows the entire movie.
Is this a series or a movie
I was hoping to see Saul Goodman again.
John Wick is like listening to a hard rock album but Nobody would be more like an album by the likes of Sinatra or Davis, Jr.
Gonna watch it. I wanna see Saul Goodman in action. DAMN!!
All those years that Saul Goodman suffered as lawyer for scumbags..boils down to this.
Is that john wick's father🥺🥺
For 12 years, I've worked for some very dangerous people. Saul Goodman talking about Heisenberg and Jesse.
Kitty cat bracelet 😕😳😍😍
I like the tagline more than the trailer  : 'NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A NOBODY'
thanks for spoiler on last season of better call saul. Now we know he will become assassin
lol
Multi punch man
Heisenberg threatning saul goodman: "its over when i say its over" *watches nobody trailer Heisenberg 10 min later: "yup its over"  EDIT: came here a month later, heisenberg says thanks for the likes, and he also says....anybody can be a nobody, but it still isn't over until he says its over😎
The 144p version of john wick
A glimpse of the saul after the events of better call saul season 6 & breaking bad season 5...
So this is the" fuckin nobody" that tarasov was talking about in john wick movie
All's not goodman
This guy killed John Wick
He learned from mr Ermantrout
"Give me the God damn kitty kat bracelet"  Now if that isn't worthy of Father of the year, then nothing is.
Saul wick ..
Bad ass movie. Waiting.........
That fucking nobody was Ben odenkirk
Violence yayyy!!!
Better cal Saul ...... 😍😎
It would be dope if at some point he goes to the continental hotel n like glances at John Wick.
Ok saul
John Wick vs The Auditor vs Brian Mills vs The Equalizer. Yup. Make it happen Warner/Sony 😁
Nobody :  Nobody :  Wait...
When two comedians, Lloyd and Odenkirk meet on the screen with a Russian actor, you should know that this is an action movie. Когда два комедийных актёра, Ллойд и Оденкирк встречаются на экране с русским актёром, знайте - перед вами боевик
Its like RED and John Wick combined
and also dont take odenkirk daughter kitty cat you animal.
Saul Wick'dMan
I might be wrong but,  In the trailer he says: 'I have worked 12 years for some very bad people'.  And he is the same actor as saul goodman sooo...
John Wick: Into the Wick-verse.
Wow... That Vaccum cleaner guy changed Jimmy too much...🐝🐝
saul goodman finally had enough being a lawyer and now he take the law onto his hand goddamn.
SONG NAME :- Just a Gigolo and I aint go nobody by " Louis prima" ❤️
GIMME THE GODDAM KITTY CAT BRACELET !! XD
john wicks twin brother
Why does this look like a xbox or ps4 game?
So.... Basically he is a married JOHN WICK.... Whose wife wasn't dead and with 2 children...
A Collab with John wick 😲
So Saul Goodman got promotion and became Nobody...😂
Special guest mr wick ?
Who is here for saul goodman
John Wick Universe
this reminds me of the film 'True Lies 1994'
Background music?
Seen all this before.
12 year's ago literally *breaking bad was released*
Heisenberg: I am danger Saul: I am Nobody
Liam neeson should be in that role......
wow... this looks awful.
Nobody : Nobody :Nobody
So it's basically just John Wick FT. Saul Goodman. Okay, I'm on board.
Is this a spoof movie 😕😕
So just a family man version of John Wick? They couldn't think of any other premise?
The man who inspired John Wick to start a family....
Actually looks good
That fuckin nobody is Nobody.
John Wick 🔥+ Nobody ⚠️ = John Wick 4
He should probably call saul
Nobody 2 - Cross with John Wick???
When are trailers gonna become trailers and not movie highlights
When John Wick isn't available, you better call Saul.
Better Call Nobody
John Wick and Nobody vs Big Table  ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
Better call nobody
Ahh, the bgm. What's the song???

So basically _John Wick_ meets _A History of Violence_ .  I'll definitely check this out.
Bob ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nobody likes this.
Saul Goodman after watching John Wick
Action heroes become older and older. I like it.
Is this a John wick spin off? That would be interesting
moral of the story if you see a guy who dumping his magzine in front of you  run for your life
It'sssall good Man
Nobody:  Nobody:
Literally nobody: I'm nobody
It looks like John wick but with extra steps
$10 says that the sequel will be called Somebody.
John wick's cousin
John Mc: I can kill a helicopter with a car Jason B: I can kill a guy with a pen n a book.. J Wick : I can kill for my dog Nobody : yeah? Well I can kill for my lil girl's kitty cat bracelet. Ace Ventura: let's make a movie together...
Better not call saul
Johann Wyckiz.

This is nice movei i like it so thank you
This is what happens when Saul Goodman becomes Walter White 🔥
John Saul
Why is Sol trying to act so serious?
Kind of my movie.. really badass...
This is what if and this is what would happen if John Wick still had a wife.
He told his wife he was John Wick and he told the lie for so long that he convinced himself.
Nobody Literally Nobody This movie "Nobody"
Everyone calls me Nobody...  Well after watching this Trailer..  I proudly call myself A Nobody...   Smthing Big is Gonna Happen from My Side
I’m so sick of movies painting men’s main quality to be violence. What are we expecting young men to take from this?
Is it a home alone spin-off
Wow! This plot looks boring and secondary as fuck, BUT i'm going to watch it anyway, cuz of Bob Odenkirk, Ilya Naishuller and Alexey Serebryakov (as a villain) in the cast
Isn’t this John Wick
Is he better call Saul????
imagine him along side Keanu Reeves in john wick 4.🔥🔥
2:48 *ding* roll credits!
Another john wick. Oops! Not even close
Police : who the fuck are you? Guy - I'm nobody Police: let me call John wick  Guy : don't call him , I'm fucking bogeyman....
– "That fucking nobody?" – "That fucking nobody is John Wick"
I thought he was a lawyer.
Saul?
Gaat DAAAMMM.....   That was Unexpected..... 😃😃😊😇
Saul Goodman??
We have John wick at home.  *The John Wick;*
I'm already hoping for a John Wick cross over lol
Am so in
he needs a damn good lawyer for sure
😍
So thats what going to happen in bcs 6.
Breaking bad Mr Saul
Saul in action. Interesting.
Saul what the fuck man
They say Nobody's perfect I finally understand why.
They should give this role to Liam Neeson.
Awesome movie, now If this movie is set up in the same universe as john wick, it would be super awesome.
its all goood man..
When in trouble you don’t fight . YOU CALL SAUL!
I wonder if this movie exist in the john wick world
If John wick ever needs legal advice he better call Saul
Better call Saul
Showed everything in the trailer whats left for the movie?
We wanted John Wick 4 and this is what we got...
"Better call Saul"😅
Well that's the advantage of being next to john wick's house 😂
Looks like RED movie
yo what if the gang on the bus was BLACK. would he be like the new EBG
You better call your lawyer right now....
So ...basically it's jhon wick if he started a family..hyped for the film
so 2nd amendment yo, time to buy guns and not golf clubs
This is John Wick's cousin.)))))
I thought Saul was a lawyer
WoooooW!!!!!. You Better Call Nobody. Gus Fring got nothing on you. I hope I can watch it in theater without the Rona.

‘Nobody’ thought ‘Saul’ could be a Kind of John Wick. 😅🤦🏼‍♂️ #welltry #letssee
Just another john wick 😁
Why does that policeman seem from Baby's day out😂
Easter Egg
Stop the trailer at least half way through! Looks fantastic but gives away too much!
Don't worry he gonna defend himself on court too incase something goes wrong. ✌️
Please make a john wick universe already we're dying for it 😩
The lawyer Trump should have called
This movie > John Wick
1:12 Bgm

Nobody:...  Nobody:

Mixture of TAKEN & JHON WICK
2021🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎
"I am gonna fuck you up! "..Woah! Looks promising.  Excited about this. But trailer could have been more discreet and subtle instead of throwing away the plot twists.
Slippin Jimmy

When Pam didn't take the job at reception, he was just a nobody doing Bob Dylan covers.  Until they took his daughter's goddamned kitty cat bracelet.

She Sal Goodman decides he’s doing being the good man.
Better Call John Wick
I'd like to believe that he's a cousin of John Wick😂
Damn for a second I thought that was Jonathan Banks (Mike Ermantraut) at 0:40
If  there is a john wick crew member in your movie, you know that movie will have some badass action scenes 🔥
Saul has had enough.
Can someone tell me the music used in this trailer
When Saul is the one who knocks!!
"Well, John wasn’t exactly the f****** boogeyman, He's the one who sent to kill the f****** boogeyman. ".... Now we know, who was the f****** boogeyman 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
Oh yeah man you keeping the standards up
Perfect.....
Into the JohnWickVerse
American middle-aged man's daydream.
They are REALLY hoping people are going to go back to Theatres in 2 months. This movie looks freaking GREAT but... idk we'll see.
They: can we copy ‘john wick’ ... yes but dont make it look obvious Ok cool we will keep wife and expand family
They should have called it - John Wick's Brother from another Mother.
You don't steal John Wick's dog and Saul's Kitty cat bracelet
If this is in the John Wick universe- I'm for it.
His Style Like John Wick

John Wick and Hutch look like ripoffs of Marvel's Punisher
"Better Call John Wick"
Plot twist:  This is in the same universe as John Wick.   Next movie will be a crossover event
Saw the whole movie in the trailer. No point in watching it now.
That's real John wick's father I guess
The son is a young Mr. Wick. Wait...whats the timeline here? Dosnt matter, John Wick can kill time. <---get it? har har.
From John wick to nobody  And from a dog to kitty kat ,, It's John wick with little wife and kids sprinkled over,, And 👍

Anyone waiting to see if it's the same universe as John wick
theaters only?? HA your funny.
Would of watched this but don't need to now as I've just basically seen it all in that 3 minute trailer 👍
This looks dope.
jon wick if he was a white man
I really thought this was comedy
This called real Hollywood
I can't help but notice the film plot's resemblance with a  Malayalam movie  "Varathan" ?  What if this is a R.....?
What's that song played in the bg..it's catchy !
That's all good man I am a nobody 🤣
Funny how people watch any piece of shit nowadays if it has wide and clean action sequences with a lazy plot
Yes, please.
Bro john wick with a family no cap
@2:36 no scope 3x kills collateral
In another world:  Saul Goodman is John Wicks dad, and that kid is later on John Wick.
Any one knows tge background music?
Боб всегда радует отменными ролями и отличной игрой! А вот как наш придурок, играющий вечно пьяных, туда попал?
It's like "What If... ?" version of John Wick 😁
THAT FUCKING NOBODY... was probably a lawyer, or something...
God Damn, I can't wait for this. Odenkirk is the shit.
Chuck is rolling in his grave.
I would love to watch that
Damn Saul Goodman.
So he's not really a nobody...
Breaking bad and better call soul fan spotted ♥️🖤
Dark comedy action John Wick.....take money!!! If you're streaming though, if this came out B.C. (before Covid) I'd be there but I ain't F'in with no movie theater.
Don't call 911 we already called Saul
I was expecting Fast and Furious spin-off...
Shit, this looks good
He's the Boogeyman and John Wick was sent to kill him. Just like the first film "He's not the Boogeyman, he's the one you call to kill the Boogeyman."
Yall remember the movie "WANTED", meet Wesley  after he settled down lol
1:31 Who all Indians think that this fight was just like Katthi Coin Fight scene... 😂
I am so hype for this. And it comes out on my birthday.
Is this in the same universe as John Wick?

So "John Wick" and "A history of violence" had a baby
John week vibe.
NICE
0:40 whadaya know, Mike made it out after all and  got back to Saul in the end.
All I want is this guy and John Wick to exist in the same cinematic universe. Just tell me they do, movie, and I'll be happy.
WHO IS HE.......????
look like in John Wick 5 (Boogeyman), he got old ard and has a new family.  maybe he kills Winston in the upcoming John Wick 4 (2022) and the High Table organization sent their men to kill him now.
Jesus, so this is what happened to saul goodman after breaking bad... rough
So this is what Mr Nobody from fast and furious is up to... Hmmmm
You Better call sual..
Song name please
Wexler/McGill Coffee cup!?!?!?!
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy
Now, Mr.Nobody is the new competitor to John wick. Let's see how long he lasts..

John Wick: Alternate Universe
Can't wait to watch!!
Nobody: Me: that's it I found the  "Nobody" guy who comes in every  youtube comment section.
The fact that they used Louis Prima’s Just a Gigolo / I Ain’t Got Nobody as the main song for this trailer makes me so happy! ‘Tis one of my favorite songs (*☻-☻*) ~~~To be precise it is Louis Prima and The Witnesses song : )
I am a so excited for this movie! I love the John Wick franchise and this gives me more of that badass action. Thanks Universal!
Don't kill Baba Yaga's dog. Don't steal random little girl's kitty cat bracelets.  These are the rules that goons must learn to live by.
This is definitely John Wick before John Wick could Wick John.
Is this John Wick spin off
Don't call 911! Wife: then who? GHOST BUSTER..
So an old john wick and the equalizer
Count me in.
This was the moment Walter White became Heisenberg

John Wick - Family Version     ..❤️
Who the fuck are you?  Me? Better call me Saul.

I guess Saul spent a few years hanging with John Wick but didn’t tell Walter or Jesse about it
I would have liked this as a series... Looks interesting
Slippin' Jimmy is killing it! :D
1.02 the last guy is from John Wick 1 ?
Is Saul playing Mike?
Yeah this is a lot like John Wick, actually this kind of could be set in the same world as John wick, the poster kind a looks like John Wick surrounded by Guns to
Meet the father of John Wick
John WIck's eldest brother
I clicked on it because I thought he looks like the from this insurance commercial 0:
The guy takes out an entire tactical team with a baseball bat

The Rundown: Suburbia
Poor man’s “The Equalizer”,  “John Wick” and “Taken” combined.
"John Wick/Law Abiding Citizen" mashup featuring Saul Goodman as an action star?... i love me some Bob O. But im prolly gonna skip this one
it’s apart of the John Wick universe , spoiler
soul goodman , u changed.man😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh shit this is Michael from GTA 5 who used to live a life of crime and then started a family with Amanda and has two kids, Jimmy and Tracy. Then, his family leaves him because he goes back to his old roots.Then Michael cleans his act up and gets back his family.😱
If this was in the same universe, l would have picked jon hamm..
Please please pleaaaassseeeee!!!!! Tell me this is set in the John Wick Universe... and somehow... someway .... either John Wick or this Nobody person makes a small cameo (in one or the others movie) haha.  Nobody: Hi John....  John Wick: Hey (Nobody), it’s been a long time. Nobody: I’m retired John Wick: Me too... sort of... (with dead bodies around them) Nobody: (single eyebrow raises) Have a good day John. John Wick: Thanks, you too. Nobody: I’ll try John Wick: Me too
That fucking nobody is... not John Wick.
Its like John Wick but more of a humor side
Never watched the original, but I imagine this is a modern take on the Man with No Name
What is Michael from gta doing in this trailer🤣
its the fuc*ed up version of john wick
Its like they took the movies John Wick, and Taken, and made a love baby movie with this.
2:08 I hope that wasn't John Wick's car...
Ultimate
John wick or not, I'm watching this
John wick when he is 60 year old an a familie men

John Wick : Family Guy Edition
Why does this feel like a John Wick rip off?
Damn... I didn't expect this from Saul Goodman!!
Saul's gonna have his work cut out trying to negotiate his way outta this one for his client
Паль,хуя чё
Lalo Salamanca's sweating after seeing the trailer

Fitting title for the turnout on release day.

John wick’s little brother
Captain price turns john wick
Getting the feeling that John Wick and Nobody is the same living universe 😂

Wow the final season of Better Call Saul looks epic!
This looks so bad and so good at the same time.
0:28 Wexler and McGill.  Better Call Saul :D
Before,don't kill the dog and now,don't take the kitty cat bracelet. Good advice
Shawn Bick
Who cares about white on white violence?    Also, I found it harder to laugh in Deadpool two because it had the same look as this, with the lense fringing on the edges, making it look more "serious" and "artsy".    Also, also, what is it with this spoil the whole damn movie on the trailer bullshit? It's not the 70s.
Liam Neeson meets John Wick
Looks like a more realistic John Wick with more characteristics.
So this is John Wick, but if she didn't die and they didn't kill his dog?
Is this actually from The Continental universe or is this just by the same directors of the film?
Absolutely fantastic and so beautiful :)
2:04 Is this movie in the same universe as John Wick?
If a suburban dad went boogeyman
Saul is now the one who knocks.
Hopefully Universal and Lionsgate come together to make this crossover with John Wick🤞.
You had me at the "I'm gonna fuck you up" part
kind of weird that they decided to combine the sequel for Joker/Taken but let's see where it goes!
Looks like it was made for me to watch lol
The only man that John Wick fears.
That’s me a regular with a set of skills, hate it for the prey who thought they were the predators
Basically he is also a john wick except he have wife and childrens
There is a new genre of movies and it's called "Don't fuck with the pet" xD
damn.
John Wick's grandpa
Hell yeah, in Theartes only. Not for the light hearted pussies who are too scared to go out in public and catch a very rare, high recovery rate of a virus.
Better call a nobody😂
What!?
80's: Lets make the typical action movie, but with a guy that looks like your average dad. Die Hard happens. 2020: Lets make a "John Wick" movie, but with a guy that looks like your average dad. This happens I guess.
2:48 The kitty cat
What would be the possibility if is within John Wick universe?
The movie plays like John Wick with no John Wick himself and different director. The background music is like a remix (if it's a remix) from F9 trailer (which the spin-off serial like Hobbs and Shaw was directed by the producer). The casts are different from John Wick. Name of the movie and character is the same with Kurt Russell's character in Furious 7 and F8 (which shared by Scott Eastwood's character).  The producer and writer are the same persons from John Wick series. The studio is also the same for FF franchise and John Wick series.  Conclusion: All facts are written by me.
Fuck me ... I thought it's gonna be "Better Call Saul" movie ...
Oh man yesssssssss can’t wait fuck
Boss:"Why did you hit my son?" Henchman: "Sir, your son stole nobodies kitty cat bracelet." Boss: "oh"
Wow, I mean there was a "russain" mafia in John Wick< but considering the cast there's gonna be real Russian mafia in this movie)
And thats what happen when mr. saul goodman gets use to it to be with mr walter white also known as the real one heisenberg. And this trailer it seems to be mr saul is a version of heisenberg 2.0 who can do everything for his family to provide them for survival. Kind of story. The makers of this movie could have kept some suspence they literally showed the whole movie everything in this trailer. And i cant also digest that old man as shown in this movie can beat many people bare hands.
Feb 2021 in theaters only So basically vaccinated crowds of octogenarians and healthcare workers...
Better Not Call 911
Nobody:  Nobody: I’m gonna fuck you up.
That's wild! I was just listening to "Just a Gigolo" by Louis Prima for the first time in a year and then it shows up in this trailer. Looks dope, kinda like Equalizer.
Нихрена себе, Паль в голливуд пробился, пока Петров только мечтает об этом)
Nobody saw this casting coming. And that's a big reason why I love this trailer and I am legitimately hyped for this film.
This looks like fun!
This movie is gonna be fucking fantastic
0:55 He did survive https://youtu.be/sl_pxCAcJz4?t=287
правильно ли я понял, что события будут происходить в киновселенной Джона Уика? или общий продюссер и некоторые актеры - это просто кликбейт?
Hmmmm. Why does everyone have SIG 552s or 553s? or MP7s?  Everything is European.  I see we have that same 'preference for Austrian or German Varietals' that Wick had, except Wick at least used an American Taran Tactical AR15 and an Italian Benelli M4 shotgun.
here @ 33k likes 333 thumbs down
plot twist. his dog gets killed by drunk minions and he gets revenge by killing all the minions and then has to kill Gru too after Gru tries to defend them.
every man whos past is not bathe in violence is no man at all i guess
Is this... a comedy?
”In theatres only 2021” yeah we’ll see about that
It'sallgoodman
John Wick: Dogs are priceless... Nobody: Hold my daughters Kitty Cat bracelet
Saul Goodman 😱😱
He once killed a man for a kitty cat bracelet. FOR A F***ING KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:29 Wexler Mcgill reference
oh so he isnt actually a nobody??? why call the movie that then??
YESSS BOB ODENKIRK!!
Damn Saul, I didn’t know you were such a bad ass
Music? pls
Iosef : who? The vakin nobody?? Vigo: that vakin nobody...... Is nobody
C'mon people, we need a crossover of The Nobody, The Equalizer, The Accountant and Wick.
Youtube´s been recommending me lots of good things lately. Thank you youtube. Gonna watch this as soon as it drops!
Vypadá to že Wick bude mít ve trojce parťáka. 8)
ummm... Why is Mr.Saul suddenly ... for lack of a better word "breaking bad" ?
Loved the pistol shot at 2:39 ❤️❤️
Does anyone know that artist and song that plays in the background?  Gracias!
Anyone know the name of the song in the trailer
Definitely watching this!
Doesn't this trailer give away the whole movie?
I have witnessed Nobody kill 3 guys with a FUCKING unsharped pencil.
That fuckin' nobody... is John Wick.
john wick but he's a dad
NAME OF THE SON?? PLS
So this is what happened if Saul could fight
This is BEAUTIFUL
Nice 😎
Saul Goodman goes Saul Badman
I can see him play a villain role: two face.
Song?
I love Bob Odenkirk
Where is Heisenberg when you need him? That's his lawyer!
In theaters!?!? Lol
Wel well look who is here.
Just take my money!
I REALLY want this movie to be good.
Серебряков? Какого..?!
Get them Saul, get them !!!
Plot Twist: They actually open the theaters
malfoy is gay
Mr. Wick U got company
Once he's done wrecking shit he should really give Saul Goodman a call to get it all sorted out legally
Well, I guess Saul Goodman finally became Saul Badman. 🥴 Ok. Lame joke.
"Dat fockin 'Nobody' wasn't John Wick..."
I have to stop watching today's movie trailers. This would have been a great movie to go into without knowing anything. I'll still be watching it and no doubt enjoy it because I'll watch anything with Bob Odenkirk in it. But I feel the best parts and reveals have probably been shown already...
When John has family
looks good
Finally Jimmy is back....LOL
john wick + joker + atomic blonde = nobody
A less gloomy version of John Wick, it seems, where cute animals don’t have to die😂
Its all about 4 legged animals
So this is what Gene was up to.
If Saul got buffed to this extent, I can’t imagine what level mike is going to be at.
John Wick DAD 🔫
This looks pretty fucking bad. I love Bob Odenkirk but he can’t play a badass. This action looks extremely stiff
Anyone know the song?
Смотрится огонь!!!
That taxi driver from Better Call Saul is sweating bullets now
Saul can fight 😂
what a movie
Ahhh so is this another story of CONTINENTAL ?
Good thing, because I would only see it if it was in theaters.
Im genuinely excited for this
This better crossover with John Wick and Atomic Blonde
I cannot fucking wait <3
Looks like a banger! I'm down
i could tell it was made by the people who made john wick.....why? guns......and killing people for something they did to something they loved.....but this time its not as worthy...a dog
Holy shit this looks awesome!!!
What is the song in this trailer!? I must know
Holy shit, better call saul :P
Saul goodman
A F*CKING NOBODY...... I MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE 😍😍😍😍 🤍
Is he nobody from hobbs and shaw?
Saul Wick
I'M PUMPED
1:33 "Don't call Saul anymore"
This is best tralier of the year👌👌😊😊
John Wick- Team Doggo Nobody: Team Kitty. Count me in- Locked n loaded!!
Awesome
At first we elected a president for them, then we shot the film for them, what next?
Its just John Wick but witha a family
Why are we replacing Keanu when he's still here. No hate for Bob odenkirk, he's a fantasic actor. But he's meant for lifht comedy and this tone of film is quite weird for his persona. Hopefully they allow him to shine instead of stripping his personality like they appear to have in the trailer. Also isn't this "nobody who beats the fuck outa people" kinda over used at this point? I mean oldboy, oldboy remake, all John wicks, most superhero movies, and others have basically the same premise. Lets hope its not a basic cash grab as this trailer suggests.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who clicked this video because of Saul Goodman (Bob Otinkerk) was on the thumbnail
Saul really got frustrated working at the cinnabon at Omaha.
Better call Saul
Happy days!
damn saul really stepped his game up
yooooooooooooooo this looks sick!
Sooo John wick??
john wick if he had a family
There needs to be a John Wick cameo in this  film
This looks good
What kind of monster stole a kitty cat bracellet?
After that you better call saul. ...ohh wait
I just realized the poster of the movie it's the same as John wicks chapter 2 poster but him being beaten.
But can he beat chuck norris??
Avengers rubbing their hands right now trynna recruit.
in theaters only.. coronavirus: not while I'm around 😷
This film seems to be inspired by John wick.
Cannot wait to see this.
1:14 that's the same guy john killed with his hands tied
Turns out Nobody is a Somebody.
damn you 2021 you got everything buddy. all the awesome movies you better be cool
John wick: im back because you killed my dog....now iam thinking am back.. nobody: WHERE IS MY DAUGHTERS BRACELET?
WOW WOW WOW!!!!
Anybody know what the song is?
So... John Wick: Dad Edition?
Walter would shit his pants if he saw this side of Saul.
“Better call saul”
Whats the name of the song in the trailer?
John Wick: I heard NOBODY's active again
Got season 6 of Better Call Saul, and this in February.  Lookin' to be the month of Odenkirk.
Bob: don't call 911 Me: I'll call better call Saul Goodman
someone know the name of the song playing in background?
Which World War flashbacks does this guy get every night? All of them.
Omg 😍
I wished those GOLD BARS where stacks coins...  This could have easily fitted in the John Wick/Assassins syndicate thing UNIVERSE and still be its own thing!
This guy is so underrated
Hellyeah looks fire
So after Breaking Bad he becomes a bad ass.. Nice
I want this
Getting A Feeling Like It's The John Wick Universe...
Lame
Я человек простой, вижу в режисерах Илья Найтшулера, ставлю лайк👍
I desperately want to see Bob Odenkirk kick ass like John Wick. I couldn't really care less if the plot feels a little rehashed from this trailer
Cannot believe my favorite milk machine has come all this way
So this is ben affleck's accountant but with family
Soooooooooo....john wick..basically..
Indian fans waiting ❤️
He's such a great actor, I'm glad to see him in this movie
Better Call Saul!
John Wick: Boomer Edition
The idea of Russians being involved implies that this film is almost certainly in the same universe as John Wick, and there is potential for them to cross over.
SRK's dilouge fit here: "Don't underestimate the power of a common man."
Wait... no. Don't call Saul.
Give the man his Goddamn kitty kat bracelet!!!
This is basically everyone "a nobody" vs 2020.
Poster ...John Wick vibe...and then the Producer is from John Wick...👏
I was laughing when he yelled, "GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!"
director of john wick, and a revenge plot about a kitty cat bracelet. looks good!
They should make it the same universe as John Wick so that 1 day we can get a crossover
Найшулер? Надо будет глянуть))
Do not call Saul. I repeat. Do not call Saul !
That NOBODY is john f**king wick
I can't wait! Looks awesome
Better Call Saul - Nobody 🔫
It is like John wick living with family after retirement and he is nobody now😆
Now I understood what Keanu was trying to say. There will be crossover. John wick v Nobody : dawn of body counts...
Well John wasn't exactly the Boogeyman... Nobody is The real Boogeyman...
Fuck it ! that's a lot of action and I'm gonna watch it...😍
Give the god damn kitty bracelet!!!!!😂😂
*Gimme Jimmy*
Give me the god damn kitty-cat bracelet...
THIS WAS HILARIOUS LMAO!!!
Please!! Somebody give this man a Gun.  Nobody:
Never steal a girl's kitty cat bracelet!!!
They better team up in the next movie
People: Nobody can beat the boogeyman! Universal: *INTERESTING*
Ladies and gentlemen Feb 26th is my b'day
Who is the idiot who encoded this video with the black bars? Can you either train this person/group of people or hire someone who can do the job at least correctly?  The movie looks great...
Walter : we are done only when I say we are done Saul : Excuse me!!!!
Watch Indians react to Nobody Btw nobody watched 🥺  https://youtu.be/yk-JrEEpMe8
i hope they tie this into the continental universe.
Give me the goddamn kitty kat bracelet
Are we really not gonna talk about the Wick reload nod at 2:53?
Can't wait 😍 😍🔥
Soooo.... A History of Violence remake?
NOBODY VS JOHN WICK
This will be a HUGE hit.
John Wick brother
This is John Wick if his wife lived.
All I see is Jimmy McGill
50 year old John Wick gets revenge on an entire PMO over a plastic bracelet.
Jhon wick started it because of a Puppy. And here it all started because of a kitty cat bracelet? 😂😂😂
🤔
Nobody is gonna watch that god damn movie... I am nobody 🤣
We all know what happens when they kill John Wick’s dog but when they take Nobody’s daughters’ kitty cat bracelet this happens .
So this is what Sual's been upto after Breaking Bad ending.
Tamil dubbed the movie 🤗🤗🤗
Missing breaking bad!🙄
Hey guys! This movie gets 5 bags of popcorn, and I’ll throw in a cute leatherback diary where you can write about your own secret life.
BREAKING: Bob Odenkirk will reprise his role as Nobody in the upcoming Spider-Man 3
Will there be a team of jhon wick and Hutch mansell?
Meh
This IS NICE!
"Dont call 911. Better call Saul"
"In Theatres Only" Best of LUCK.
John wick universe maybe?
Bruce Willis : Why am I not in this movie?
Nobody can separate money and Bob Odenkirk
Nobody:
Did you guys see the Wexler-McGill reference on that tumblr too?
Yes!!
The thumbnail is also similar to John  Wick
Better call Saul was a great show but Bob Odenkirk looks to old and to slow to be playing this character, Even though CGI speeded up his punches they still looked slow🤦‍♂️
Very nice screen play
I'm nobody
Married John Wick. Bring it on with all the family emotions backing up the action!
John Wick kills an entire organization because his dog was killed. This guys will kill anyone for a Kitty Cat Bracelet.
I was watching a review of Beckman and I don’t know why but this reminds me of that movie.
Second Part: Somebody Third Part: Anybody And from the makers of Nobody, Somebody and Anybody here comes: EVERYBODY!
Might come back and watch this trailer for the fifth time tonight. So freaking excited this looks so bad ass!
“So if you got a problem and you need someone dead, Better Call Saul”
that last bit "Who the Fuck are you" says it all LMAO
Alright I'm on board
#TheNobody
The John wick cinematic universe
Дожили блядь,русский снимает кино в голливуде про борьбу американца со злыми русскими)))
Anyone know the name of the song that plays throughout?
The WCU, Wick Cinematic Universe
So John Wick had a Dog & Nobody has a Kitty Cat bracelet. 😗😗
*This movie has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 scamdemic lockdown* - Sincerely your tyrannic, globalist government.
Nobody to his family : Don't call 911. Family: So, whom should we call?  Nobody: 191. It's John wick's number.
Turns out this is Wick’s brother
Another over-the-top action movie. *Yawn. Hollywood sucks.
Nobody literally nobody : Then meme template becomes movie title😂😂😂
Damn great to see saul in total different Avatar 🔥
Lawyers don't do this type of sh*t
Better call Saul wickman
Holy SH*T Bob Odenkirk is badass!!!
"I am the one who knocks"
¶ Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. Proverbs 18:12 KJV
Best trailer of the wick... I mean... of the week
Don't call the police... Better Call Saul instead.
John Wick: 😎 Nobody: 💩
Saul Goodman has come a long way
When Saul Goodman was discouraged from being a lawyer, and now he's become a nobody
saul got into too much because of Walter that now he has to be john wick.
Don't care. Bob Odenkirk is a legit great EVERYTHING!
Wait...who is this actor? Seriously?
Love you Saul, love you Jimmy, love you BOb!
I was wondering what happened to John Wicks older brother.
Well, he better call Saul to save himself
Илья, не подведи! Спаси наш кинематограф!
Who wants to see a crossover movie with Nobody and Wick?
An expansion of Saul and Mike
he gives me bruce willis vibes in a john wick movie
Lil like Jack.R but look pretty 👍
Waiting for the thunder 🔥
Song?
Never ever gonna bully anybody
Now I have to know if he gets the KITTY KAT BRACELET  back or not
Holy shit! Bob Odenkirk is a total badass!
John killed for his dog This guy killed for the KITTY KAT BRACELET
I vote him as Sam fisher!
Holy fuck this looks awesome.
Vishvaroopam #KamalHasan
Song?
Daughter: "They stole my Kitty Kat  bracelet..." Dad: (points gun at thug)"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY KAT BRACELET!" T'Challa: "Get this man the Best Father Of The Year award"
It's fucking dope and awesome 💥💥
Not the John Wick we deserved but the John Wick we needed
When you are in a problem, you “Better Call Saul.”
Nobody Nobody 2: Somebody Nobody 3: Everybody Nobody 2020: Homebody
"Me? I'm slippin' jimmy"
fuck yeah
I know a guy who knows a nobody
This man is making an entire John Wick universe.
Saul really popped off
Way to go slippin' jimmy
Action movies need more characters. John Wick, Atomic Blonde, this. There aren't enough movies about unstoppable motherfuckers who just ruin everything, and it looks like this recent wave is trying to pick up the slack
When Saul is angry
"Better call Nobody"
So this is John Weik
....another John Wick? why're people liking something thats already been made?
John wick came out said step up and some action movies are really going for it!
When SAUL GOODMAN decides to be Mark
It all started with a kitty cat bracelet
I fking love bob odenkirk. Can't wait
This Nobody guy could be a very extraordinary authentic badass sidekick for John Wick.
He sends people on a trip to Belize.
How you suddenly became Nobody ?  I recall you were a Goodman.
This is just a more comedic John Wick
Это же Пааааль
Saul "John Wick" Goodman...fucking awesome
He defecated through a sunroof!- Charles McGill
Looks fun
So is he new john wick
What’s the name of the song
So basically, a comical version of John Wick. 👍🏻
Nobody: in theaters February 26th Corona: Ain't nobody gonna watch this movie.  🤦🏻‍♂️
From director who trying kill f#ckin deadpool

Same universe as John Wick?
New John Wick in town.🔥🔥🔥

0:29 Wexler-McGill Cup.
This is what happens when Saul overtakes Heisenberg's character 😂
Thats what Chalie Manson said in jail ''I'm Nobody''
Anyone know what song or soundtrack is in the trailer??
Where is bruce willis.... It's more like RED
Pg-13 John wick?
this looks so sick!
Great man..!!!
Cousin of JOhn Wick!

Awesome
Would love a john wick universe
Wow walter really did ruin saul's life
Boogeyman in the flash

I clicked the video for the thumbnail
When is it out?????
Nobody: This movie's title: "Nobody"
Slippin Johny
looks ok, might see it. to be honest, it seems a lot like a rip off of john wick tho...
Guys, only the top class agent/assasin used nickname like Nobody lol. Heard his name and you know you f*ck up with the wrong guy.
so whos the one who knocks?
John wick in parallel universe 😂
Looks dope.
Sliping Jimmy is no more a Sliping Jimmy!
What john wick wudve been if his wife didnt die
I think I saw Ch. Lloyd & Dolph Lundgren
whats this song ?
cant wait for crossover... with John wick... Avenger assemble.
This is basically john wick without the dog.... Literally everything else is the same even the trailer thumbnail
John Wick weakness-- Dog Nobody's weakness-- KittyCat  - - - - - - - - - - - -
Its like family man gone rogue
John wick's Father....
This is basicaly the older version of John Wick. But Not as badass.
Опять, да вы заебали, в России столько уголовников нет сколько в ваших фильмах сняли. Снимите лучше кино про Пол Пота и про то, как Американцы там резвились. Да просто ткните пальцем в глобус и попадёте в похожее место.
I'm nobody. I'm a tramp, a bum, a hobo. I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine, and a straight razor if you get too close to me.  :P
This looks awesome!
Better call saul!!! 😅
This what would've happened if John's wife didn't die and they started a family
Now thats called a action movie.. Haven't seen such from long time
DAMN JIMMY
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET
I want that background song
Setting up the Continental Cinematic Universe? CCU?
Better call Saul for the part
Finally something worthy to be put on my watchlist
Ma man sal Goodman:)
Spoiler alert: He repents for the men he killed and becomes a lawyer to save all the potential criminals but eventually goes the wrong way and starts selling cinnamon cakes.
Post-credit scene:       John Wick: They did you pretty good but I need your help for my next sequel. You still hurt? Bob Odenkirk: It's all good, man.
Don't call 911 You better call saul
Who is badass ? Nobody 😎
💪👍
Director: "The stunt man punched you a bit too hard there. You wanna keep going?" Bob Odenkirk: "It's all good, man."
John wick: for my dog Nobody: for the kitty cat bracelet
I didn't expect this when it clicked the trailer                   It was fukin awesome........
That Fucking NOBODY is here to Say.... Hello
My English teacher looks like him
Where can I get that song from the end of the trailer?
what is this bgm ? can anyone name please
John Wick?
keanu reeves cameo would be amazing 😜

Chuck is gonna get one in a million ass whooping
It's a plagiarism of the Jhon W... never mind, Nobody care seems it's nice

Pity all these Marvel trailers that came out yesterday are throwing shade on this. Looks awesome.
Bob looking like john wick😂😂😂😂
Smells like John Wick❤️
Sorry, put this on streaming because I'm not dumb enough to risk Covid-19 for a damn movie.
Would luv to hav a john wick cameo in it..
👌👌
OH YES JOKER GOODMAN
When you're finally tired of Walter and Jessie's drama.
john wick in parallel  universe 😃✌
Sequel to better call saul n breaking bad had toll on him🔥

Wait a minute.. What the fuck.. saul goodman broke bad?   Can we all make a petition to include this movie in the wickverse?
So you are saying slippin Jimmy is nobody....
WTF....this is a whole lot a action movie.......might be more epic then John Wick....wow man.... I like u r innocency 💝
Is this john wick brother from another mother?
Nobody making Better call Saul jokes?
The alternate universe of John wick with family...
For middle aged men with anger issues...
Jack reacher + John wick = nobody 😒
Father wick
Tbh I was thinking this was gonna be more like American Ultra where they tried to make Jessie Eisnburg badass and it just came out weird. This trailer changed my mind and I'm actually looking forward to it. I just hope the fact no theaters are operating at full capacity won't affect how this movie goes later on. It deserves a chance to work out.
Better call Saul man
Who are you  ?   " Better call SAUL " 😆😅😂😁  Impressive👍🤩😍
Dang. Those punches!
Looks good but it would be way better if he had no criminal past and was a total family man that went full vigilante to get back his daughters kitty cat bracelet.
#Goosebumps #trailer #nobody #multiverse_of_johnwick  @universalpicturesindia @universalpictures
Saul : Are we done? Walt : We're done, When I say it's done Nobody : Hold my daughter's kitty cat bracelet 😠 2:25
SAUL I thought you were a lawyer 😢
Johnwick lite?
Same universe as John Wick?
This trailer showed too much movie
Another bullshit story (no original)
this so fucking awesome!!!!!!!
He's not in danger. He's the danger. He's the one that knocks.
Damn Bob, didn't know he had it in him!
O bcs bad guy
John Wick 0.5
Just because he said Give Me the GODDAMN KITTY CAT! I think I'm going to watch it. Looks not boring.
So John Wick meets A History of Violence?
Saul goodman when he finally snapped
After this you better call Saul..
I'm in love with this trailer.😍
It was this moment when Saul became Heisenberg.
Better call Saul
Another John wick
The lawyer of the one who knocks... 😎👑👑🌠🔥🖤
Thumbs up for Saul Goodman :)
This is such a parody of John Wick, even the thumbnail resembles the poster for John Wick 2
BETTER CALL SAUL BABY! 😂
Надо же было старика оденкерка брать на роль, чувствую драки будут уг, ну не вывозит человек в силу возраста ну емое
Nobody excommunicatdo order 00001 confirmed
"Don't Call 911" "Better Call Saul"
..I  never had the chance to see John Wicks' Chapter 3. I better see it before everyone see nobody
oh this is  spin off of  john wick or something like that
So they come and robe your home, it's ok nobody is hurt, damage will be covered by insurance, but the kitty cat bracelet, that's when man snaps.
It'sallgood
Oh my god.
So they hired one of the best Russian actor to play Russian mob, I think the end product will be good.
He went From saul good man to saul bad man 🔥
john wicks producer and plot wow how cool!

Nobody's a Nobody

This is Saul Goodman after he had to change his identity again after being a the manager of a Cinnabon, after already changing his identity.
_uh.. you working again?_
Oye houy hoi hoi!!!!.....
Name of song?
Lawyer kills 😛
You thought John Wick was the only one to get out?  Bourne Franchise- Hey!
Saul Goodman in his new identity after leaving albuquerque
FINALLY a movie trailer that makes me want to watch the movie!
I knew from the thumbnail that it's related to John Wick
I feel like I've just seen the whole movie
John Wick as a comedy movie
Saul Had to Become a loyer because he was bored of the action
Better call Saul! Before he calls you.
This the moment when Saul becomes Heisenberg
Вот как же приятно видеть российских актёрах в таких картинах
Holy fuck, Saul Goodman strikes again
hi I hope you are doing well. I make music but it's really hard to have visibility when you're little, but I do my best to make my art known. I invite you to discover my beats and if you are not disappointed, do not hesitate to subscribe and share with your friends. Peace;)
A revenge drama...how original!
Name of the song used in trailer? Anybody?
I miss film like this🔥🔥🔥
So how many John Wick references you want?  The Comments: Yes

Here we go again. It’s now a kitty cat bracelet. Soon it will be bag of nachos. Well done
Ооо, так тут Паль!!! Ура!
Nobody to family, If I am dead....           Better call saul
Hollywood lost their mind! No way I am gonna watch this movie, at least not when I’m sober
What if they make a franchise which includes both mr.nobody and John wick....just gonna be lit then🔥🔥🔥
Well now, saul become nobody.  Wait until he becomes john wick. 🤐
опять русских злодеями выставляют.
Them to John Wick: its just a dog!  Them to Nobody: its just a cat!
1:33 Better call Saul
Its all good man.
Better call nobody!!!
He's not nobody. He's the man who was sent to kill nobody.
Better call "Nobody"
I love all of the BCS/BB jokes in the comments
Don't call 911.   You better call Saul.
Damn, I didn't know Saul Goodman was this badass
Those punches felt heavy.
"Who the fuck are you?" "I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude."
Don't call 911, better call saul.
Really February 🤷🏻‍♂️ I hate waiting for content
SPOILER : All of a sudden LOKI is gonna give a SURPRISE cameo in this movie.
This movie looks like it’s gonna be dope.
Bad russians? Again?
John Wick cinematic universe?
Dammm my man Odysseus looking good even  after many millennia.
MIX  OF  JOHN WICK , DIE HARD AND BETTER CALL SAUL
I love Bob Odenkirk, but I could've never figured he had this much action in him. Holy fucking shit, this blew my mind
Looks so promising 🔥💯
Aliexpress John Wick
He is not a main stream actor...but Boy I am so pumped up
Oh yeahhh~
Yeah! Stay away from them kitty cat bracelet.  Those are the thin line which exists between life or death.
john wick look I found your dad.
Saul Wick, the BabyYaga
This can kill KimJongUn in a instant.
Why is it always a personal tragedy becomes the reason for a Man to stand up for Himself
2:37 When you triple collate.
1. Don't kill the dog. 2. Don't steal the kitty cat bracelet.
John Wick called, he want his movie back!
.
Saul is such a BADASS!!!
So no ones gonna talk about how this movie is executively produced by Tobey Maguire?
This poster got me John wick vibes.
0:28 WM - Wexler & McGill
No one: Absolutely no one: Nobody:
Looks good
Who r u I am the guy who know a guy
❌Nemo NOBODY is pissed❌
Better call NOBODY🔪🔪
Come on, isn't everyone tired of these movies?
Give me the GD kitty kat bracelet!
cant wait to see this awesomeness
Anybody know the song name?
For 12-yrs I worked for some very dangerous people. Yaaa we know Saul...
2:47 ооох.. тру детективом запахло))
Finally looks like Saul has had enough
Fuck yeah i m in.... Excited 🙆‍♂️
A script chewed up a lot of violence, Hollywood is the bigger promoter of violence in the world
international  family man
That's looks gooooddd
So john wick just another form
Wow mind blowing 😘👍
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Nobody: Me? I’m nobody
So saul goodman is a nobody now
Cops: You better lawyer up. Bob: I know a guy who knows a guy.
I've been watching so many kung fu films lately, I actually expected Saul Goodman to go Ip Man on those guys on the bus.
Daddy john wick 😂😂
Ilya Naishuler! Nice director ☺️
This trailer is horrible.... I feel like I've already see the whole movie
What the hell did I just see here? John Wick alternative universe which has Kitty Cat as the turning point? Damn. Rockin Saul! 🔥🔥🔥
Saul goodmen is no more good !LMAO
This is John wick prequel. With kids. Nobody wanted them.
https://youtu.be/CTs5VEaZL94
ахуенно!
This movie's director made 'Hardcore Henry'. Just FYI.
The thumbnail is pretty much similar to #Jallikattu.
Is that paul saulman from Breaking bad?
Only a true actor can make it that intriguing.. theatre it is
john wick universe is a go
Generic action movie!
Ooh I'm so eager to watch saul goodman going badman.
When I saw the thumbnail, I thought it was a comedy/John Wick parody movie lol
is it because of that goddamn cat or what?
If John Wick's wife didn't die and they had kids together
I imagine him meeting john wick as the film's post credit scene
I just realised what this is!  Or at least what it could be.   This is the rebirth of Trinity.  "My Name Is Nobody".  First you have Westerns, then you have Spagetti Westerns. Here we had Action Films, now we have Spagetti (?) Action films. Okay fine, the analogy isn't perfect, as it's not a reduced budget, nor shot in Italy, but the idea of the comedic everyman hero character being underestimated is fantastic, and it feels very much like it's poking fun at the more serious action tropes to a degree.
hey, we found john wick's classmate in middle school.
*Just call me Saul*
Plot twist: he's John wicks elder brother
Can't wait for the climatic plot twist where the wife starts throwing MFs around stabbing them with a sword and reveals herself to be the queen of the Amazons.
wooooo this is some serious action its gonna be fun to watch 👍👏
Awesome !!!!
0:40 is that Mike Ehrmantraut 😆
This is the moment Jimmy became Saul
We need a fuking cross over between nobody and John....it's going to be a blockbuster
Its all good man!
le john wick :- അനിയൻ
Movie is showing my secret wish for past 15 years. To become a vigilante who kills scum and makes my city better. Shame I could never find like minded people to help me.
demnnnnnnnnn
Лайк за Александра Паля!!! Лайк за Алексея Серебрякова!!! Лайк за трейлер!!! 🤟🤟🤟
Badass
Saul goodmen iszz back mennnn!!!🔥
So John wick is going to be  Breaking  Bad.  Even its for a dog or a kitty cat bracelet, i like these kind of movies
I love how they poked one towards WB at the end with the "Theaters Only" thing. :]
All these fireworks for a kitty cat bracelet?
This looks fun, but also a lot like A History of Violence. Hopefully it's more unique than this trailer paints it.
What happened to Saul?? 😱😱
I wonder if he knows a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy name John Wick.
Noice. They got Tobey Maguire for this
John wick vibes ❤️
That's just soul transfer from Heisenberg to Saul Goodman. C'mon nobody sees this?
Really excited to see Odenkirk play this role.
Better call Saul 🔥
Try watching history of violence, it has similar storyline
Soooo.... is this in the same universe as John Wick?
👌
This practically has the same theme as John Wick. A decent, nice-looking man living an average life whose dark and violent past is revealed when his loved ones are harmed or threatened.
don't call saul
Saul Goodman just kiling it
I’m genuinely stoked for action guy bob odenkirk lol
Shit this is awesome
"BETTER CALL JOHN WICK SEASON 1"
Actually made sense that at the beginning he's shown to refrain from violence considering he practically experienced a lot of that back in his early years.
John Wick with Family  Thats True And Thumbnail Is Also Inspired From Poster Of John Wick Chapter 2
Welcome to the John wick 'universe'
Rip off of John Wick fuck off be more creative and don’t still ideas
Nobody is perfect
You better call Saul
okay!
John Wick : Uncle Edition
did anyone see Mike ???
So he is breaking bad.
Now everybody's sure that nobody's gonna call Saul
It looks like this movie is the god shit
he looks like clint eastwood and pierce brosnan damn, the spaghetti western 007
Does it better 👄
Its Jimmy!
"GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!"  *W H E E Z E*
Ok John wick's uncle is here Btw can't wait to see😁🙏
*From the director of John Wick* He killed 4 guys with a fuckin baseball bat
Better call John wick
2:47 — You ain't nobody, pal.
Well You Don't Need To Write About Bob Odenkirk's Work. People Know Him Already 🤷‍♂️
Trailer song name?
F#####yeah!!!!
Now where have I seen this before?🤔🤔
I love his fighting style
Where is tha main dialogue?? "Better call Saul"
TRIPLE HEADSHOT
Mach*d  diye bhayia aap to
Thats why saul goodman never hit walter white because 0:32 😂😂😂😂
Wow R rated.. That's what I wish ❤️
Johnny wick's cousin
When you order John Wick from Amazon
A movie starring Bob OdenKeanu - I'm in.
okey, fellows. here you go: 1. go to the Tе-lеg-ram.. 2. search for the chan-nel "Walter CoinCoin". 3. learn how to start copying transactions automatically. 4. switch on copuing the deals. 5. Lots of money! Don't thank.
Bob is great but this seems like a miscast. Or maybe it's just an uninspired movie idea that no one would make better.
RED vibes anyone?
It saul good man..
Soul? Wake up, wake up Soul you are dreaming)
Bob Odenkirk kicking some butt ? I’m in
Saul Wick
The lawyer from BREAKING BAD to a action hero
“Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
John wick but in his late 50's........ Anyway...this looks cool...I'll watch it👍
Better Call Nobody
me as a kid when i go to McDonalds : 2:26
Agent: Who the f**k are you? Hutch: Me? Let's say I'm a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy.
GIVE ME THE KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!!
*That f*cking nobody is JOHN WICK*
Badshah English Remake LOL🤣
looks good
So that's what 'Send them to Belize" means
so, this is parody of john wick but same action? interisting
0:57 Would be so epic if he said: "Better call Saul" at this moment
John McClane + John Wick = Nobody
Now all those nobody memes are gonna be confusing
Which song at  1:13
Just call *saul* for the fuck sake
Alternate Name : John Wick (Lite Version)
No the name of the song?
What song is that?
Yes, finally a good action comedy movie is back.
Trust me, This guy is somebody!
He better call s...
John wick multiverse ''WHAT IF?''
Yasss I love it, i hope that he and jhonn wick meet at some point
In Theatres only February 26th and available for streaming February 27th. Jokes aside this looks good though.
I'm looking forward to this.
This definitely comes from the producers of John Wick maybe we can get a cross over
"I'm his lawyer, Saul Goodman, and my client has done nothing wrong"
Let me guess. He kills three guys in a bar with his f*cking fists?
"I may have overcorrected."  ... damn. When did Saul skip over his Daredevil phase and go straight to retired Punisher?  "GIVE ME THE GODDAMNED KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!"  Pet lover. I think him and John Wick would get along.
Agent Jun Hitman Hollywood version? I'm in
Somebody pleaaaaaseeee......give me the background music name....
whats the song at 1:13? its dope
Its like john wick with a family i guess
A moment of saulidarity....
I just love it when trailers spoil the movie now I don't have to watch it
Great trailer. And it's from the producer of John Wick and Exec produced by Tobey Maguire (sounds strange) only adds to the excitement.
RED? anyone?
This movie makes you Feel like it's John Wick but it isn't John Wick.
Imagine watching this movie for the first time without knowing anything whatsoever about it. How cool would it be to discover the plot twists for the first time, being amazed and impressed by the exciting action scenes. At what point did it all change? who made the decision that the public were too simple minded to want to watch a movie without first revealing everything in the trailer?
Just one word wow...
nobody nobody nobody does it better
Awesome 😎
“That fucking nobody is nobody!!”
Saul gone wick
A mixer of John Wick and Hardcore Henry
David Leitch And Chad Stahelski Are Best Friends On The Same Film.  Holy Shit You Blew My Mind Without Shaky Cams And No Fast Cutting.
This guy looks like he knows a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy
So he’s the one that John wick wanted to be
They wanted to make John wick but with less budget
This reminds me of that Kean Matrix guy movie that came out a couple years back. Not the matrix movies I mean. The one that is loosely based on Shibumi by Trevanian.
Better call Saul.. Saul hitman
Didn’t expect that this role would suit him. Looking forward to this. It would be wonderful to see a crossover between his role and John Wick in future.
If john wick had a family then this it happens.
Keanu Reeves And Bob Odenkirk: *[Exists]*  Also Me: OUR Treasures.
A Normal Day In John Wick Universe.  Also John Wick Universe:
Don't mess with Saul.
Yes yes yes yes yes.
what's up with saul?? jjjjjjjjjj
Imagine explaining the plot of the movie. Oh ya its about this guy called nobody trying to get his daughters kitty cat braclet back from a bunch of Russians.
Thank god John Wick got popular and so did the director. This is gonna revive the real action and not those cgi bullcrap. People are appreciating these movies and I believe now we'll have good cinema.
Saul Wick
That looks something good
Dayum!
John Wick's Lawyer.
Why am I getting home alone vibes🤣🤣🤣 It's like we catch up with Kevin when he's a lot older and has gotten bored with killing the petty criminals in the original movies.
I love the fact that they are working with the right people who know how to make such movies. David Leitch from John Wick and Illya Naishuller for Hardcore Henry.
It's slippin' Jimmy, and it's all a one big long con.
John Wick with a family? Yeah i'll watch it
"From Producer of John Wick" Explains everything
2:22 love that kill bill reference
This look like a a decent parody of John wick
john is that you?
Nobody:  Not a single should:  Universal: Nobody
This is gonna be so good wtf
Back sound is lit
Jhony wick universe babby
that fuckin nobody is fuckin nobody
The Next John Wick
Looks Like Copied From Family Men Indian series 🇮🇳
director by ilya naishuller is the same guy from hardcore herny omg this is going be good
Who are you Bob odenkirk: im the one who knocks
I need a new dust filter for my Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro model 60.
Only one choice in this world matters: 1) Will you build YOUR kingdom and serve yourself as you prop yourself up. 2) Will you serve God and submit to His Kingdom. Serving others than yourself. Get to know Jesus before it is too late.  <3
He needs a pencil lol 😂
Is it BCS sequel??
" first of all , i am nobody "
So this is what happen to Saul afterwards
Nobody end credit scene: Man in Moroccan costume approaches Nobody: Man: I have a job for you? Nobody: Yeah? Who are you supposed to be? Man: They call me Elder and I want you to bring me John Wick’s head.
So this is John Wick+ Kill Bill+Joker+ any other iconic fight scene rip off? Nice.
damn great use of Louis Prima, I respect and look forward to this
John Wick got pissed because bad guys killed his dog.  Nobody got pissed because bad guys stole his daughter's kitty cat bracelet.  I AM SO IN TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
ladies and gentlemen Saul Goodman is in action 😍  😍  😍  😍
“The average dog is a nicer person than the average person.”
Jimmy
Jesus Christ, it's Johnny Wickgill.
The next john wick
Can anybody tell bgm name
Plot Twist : He's John Wick's dad..
👌👌👌👌
Plot twist: Its the new John Wick movie only it's with deepfake.
Please be in the same universe as John Wick
❤️❤️❤️💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When you had being enough of lawyer
Nobody looks good💩https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
When shit goes down, You better call Saul!
okay, im in
So glad bob odenkirk got this role
Imagine this Nobody guy team up with John Wick to fuck up the High Table.
1:33 Don’t call 911? Better call Saul, then.
John wick old version
Mr Nobody Maybe he is John wick father OR    John wick after the family
If Saul tried to handle the rough part also
😱😱wtf, masterpiece level action
Outstanding 😳😳😳
Saul finally broke bad
The director of Hardcore Henry and two of the creators of John Wick? Hell yeah, man.
Slippin Jimmy ain't slippin anymore... he will fuck you up.... Maybe John Wick will need a lawyer in  John Wick 4, Soul Goodman is coming in rescue with His less of law degree more of the skills that Mike Ehrmentraut. taught him...
is that SAUL GOODMAN??? 😳😳😳😳
It's like watching one of fellow retired john wick associate. Who knows. Same director.
I want el Camino 2
But the nobody is john wick
This is the funniest shit
I really want a post credit scene to where he meets or hears rumors about John Wick
Watch he gone help John Wick in the Fourthe one!
It's all good man
He's the middle aged middle class John Wick
Is that Adam Sandler
oh wow
Saul got balls now lmao
I will watch in theatres
Can’t wait!
Hahah finally her kitty cat at 2:49  ending exposed 😂😂😂😂😂
At the first instance...looking at the faded thumbnail..I assumed that he was Pankaj Tripathi 😂😂😂😂
And the at the last he must say 'Better call Saul'!!
Name of the song of the second part?
Its all good man 😉
I know a guy who knows a guy 😂 Saul Goodman back again
Just awsomeee
Better Call...Nobody?
sab kuch to trailer pe dekha dea,, film mai dekne k lia kuch baki ha?
0:28 Wexler-McGill reference?
Saul!! If you knew all this why didn't you help Jesse
You had me at "IN THEATERS ONLY"
Who is the one who knocks now!
Give me the goddamn kitty kat bracelet!!!
I see the vacuum cleaner guy did his job to perfection.
Saul Goodman?????
They shouldn't have stolen that kitty cat's bracelet 🤔
Just copying John wick
Better call Saul ❤️
Its all good man
I want to see a crossover between him and john week. 🤞
I cant believe someone on reddit fucking called the "me? I'm nobody" line and the movie hasn't even came out I'm actually dying rn.
Saul? Is that you?
What song is playing?
Nobody cares.
This is probably what would have eventually happened to John Wick if his wife didn't die.. except the fact that he would be called baba yaga and here he is called an auditor..
I don't think there's a dad of younger kids, 35-45, on here who didn't watch that and go, "Hell YES I'd do that if someone messed with my kid's <insert random prized possession here>"
Is he a relative of John wick.
"GIVE ME THE *GODDAMN* KITTY CAT BRACELET!!" That settles it. I'm seeing this movie
1:33 Better call Saul
Nobody... It's a old jhon weck 💯♠️
gemmm upcoming
What is this joker 2?
You are god damn right saul goodman!!!
Am I the only one that thinks this looks lame AF?
That fu**ing nobody............................... is John Wick
It's Aldi brand John Wick
Song? 1:05
Is this not just another JW?
So, I guess the lawyer will be Walter White?
Could have saved millions if they just used wooden hand puppets, and singing "Im a grateful victim" karoke style when ever there's a fight scene...
when you come up with a name when you dont have any names. its lazy but entertaining
Niceeeeeee
I fucking love this
I. AM. GONNA. SEE. THHHIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.  :D
Fuck yea
Damn nice lyrics. Hats off.
Baba Yaga The Equalizer The Accountant The Auditor
THANK GOD!!! A real fucking movie! A real adventure!
When saul goodman got tired of everyone else's bullshit at cinnabon.
So where's John Wick ?
That NOBODY is John Wick .
fucking nobody is Bob Odenkirk!
Music of the trailer???!!!!
1:33 voice kinda remains me  of john wick.
Walmart John Wick
Wow! I was overly surprised, after thinking this was going to a be a get cheap laughs John Wick wanna be. Hope it can live up to the trailer. There is not a single person who hasn't been tricked by a trailer once or twice!  😂
Imagine this movie takes place in the same universe as John Wick.
A John Wick prequel 😁
Remember when Losef told Viggo that he is fucking Nobody... he was talking about him😀
That kid on the first John wick. Fucking Nobody is real. Not just John Wick
Just an old man John Wick was chilling with his family. That fu***** NOBODY is....
Wow. BETTER CALL FUCKING SAUL!
Don't call 911-- better call saul 😎
This February...Saul...Gets...Salty.

John Wick lawyer.
Kya movie h bhai...🔥
When played too much PUBG

After Odysseus was caught by the cyclops, he told that his name was Nobody, so when he poked its eye out and its friends asked who did it, all the cyclops could say was "Nobody".
Hell yeah
Poor people's John Wick huh 😂😂
Тот случай когда право снимать русских в роли бандитов, принадлежит русскому режиссёру.
I'm just glad I can finally see Bob Odenkirk beat the shit outta people.
Simply best and beautiful.......some one give this nobody like....😀😀
When did Saul become so badass
HE ONCE KILLED A MAN FOR A KITTY CAT BRACELET.  FOR A F**KING KITTY CAT BRACELET.
At first I thought it was a remake of History of Violence, Looks like it will be similar but without the silly mob accent.
It's like if John Wick had never lost his wife and they had children.
Me during the entire trailer : "MORE! MOOORE!"
Saul Badman
Discount Kevin Costner is no longer on discount.
So its John wick
“That fuckin nobody is john wick”
Awesome
Saul Wick
Looks promising
Well SOMEBODY needs to tell Walt and Jesse to stop harassing this guy
A History of Violence (2005) meets John Wick
Seems like this is gonna be good ...
Any one know soundtrack
What is the song
Kitty cat bracelet.  :)
Ah, I get it he's a Democrat venting his anger after putting up with Trump and his minions for four years. Ya I went there.
👍👍👍👍
I was not expecting this awesome trailer
Never call saul
2:37 My guy trying out for the #FAZE5 challenge with those sniper shots
Alternative universe for John Wick
"That fuckin' nobody...is nobody."
Amigo creo que vas a necesitar un buen abogado para salir de esos aprietos, te recomiendo uno que se llama saul es muy bueno.
First time I've looked up a trailer after getting as an ad. Genuinely interested
PAL? Holy shit, I'm so glad to see Alexandr Pal get to star in some foreign movies
https://youtu.be/HT9F8Z-pRPg
Don't Call 911. Better call Saul
1:12 sounds like the cat vibing video 😭 https://youtu.be/NUYvbT6vTPs
I'm definitely going to watch this movie 🍿
I dont know why but Bob looks like a comic character.
What if John wick had a family and kids. Nobody -
This is just a spin-off movie of just what John Wick would do if you ever fucking touch his family.
I just started the Better call Saul series! On my calendar for sure.
Remember in John Wick...the Russian mafia kid said "he's a nobody!" Mafia dad replied "that nobody is..." Great reference.
Saul is just six and tired for hidding to long
Give me the goddanm kitty bracelet      New level of Dad mode activated TURBO
Is this on the John Wick universe?
He looks like a older John Wick, a really retired John Wick.
I like it
dam, Saul Goodman's new life is looking pretty good.
hell yeah im gonna love this
This is a side of Saul Goodman that I have never seen before I wonder why he wasn’t like this in breaking bad or you better call Saul
I cannot wait to see this!
Amazing 👌
This looks really awesome
Is it me or at the end of the trailer or dose he look like Max Payne?
I reallllllly hope this is in the same universe as John Wick
Better Call Saul Wick.
I wish the movie studios wouldn't do this to their films. They basically show you the whole film in the trailer. Even the bracelet joke. This would have been a must see for me. Just having Saul in it. Was a big selling point. I know from the extra long trailer, this is not going to be a good film. Reasons: Over the top everything. Non believable action. The foreign element. Just hearing their voices makes me not want to see this film. Maybe the studio did that for the UK audience? I don't care either way. I just don't like it. I will probably see this film online for FREE. I don't think it will get great reviews. But, if there's a miracle. Then I will watch it in a theater. If the government stops with the Fake deadly FLU. And lets theaters open again.   It's so frustrating watching trainers like this. You leave nothing on the bone. No suspense or intrigue left with trailers like this.
Mja agya bhai sahab.. 👍👍😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊
Trailer: From producer David Leitch Me: I sleep Trailer: Directed by Ilya Naishuller Me: REAL SHIT?!?!
Why February 26...I need it now
Is this a John wick parody? even the poster looks like it
I usually don’t like violence as entertainment but this looks Really entertaining!
Original trailer song: Just A Gigolo / I Ain't Got Nobody
Tf Saul doing
Did anyone notice the guy getting a triple headshot with a sniper rifle
Suburban Wick!!
I choose to believe this is set in the same universe as the John Wick movies.
Ok Bob
So we were already living in the Mr. Show universe and now this is a real movie. Can't wait for Biden to blow up the moon.
So that’s what an Auditor does. Glad I pay my taxes.
John Wick has a dog 2:45 Nobody has a cat
"Hes a nobody"..." That fucking nobody is'..."nobody"
Better Call Nobody.
The editing on this is amazing!
song???
Man if only Kim Wexler was in this movie as his wife!
Season 6 Of Better Call Saul Looks Amazing!
Saul goodman in the next life lol
SAUL GOODMAN GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
O my gosh this is what I’ve been waiting for
The part of Bruce Willis and/or Liam Neeson will now be played by Bob Odenkirk. Looks good, though.
Okay... hear me out... this guy and John Wick in a cross platform movie where they start out as enemies and end up going after the same guy who owes them multiple debts.
"They stole my kitty cat bracelet."  "GIVE ME THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET!"
Who knew Saul Goodman had it in him
0:29 Wexler Mcgill
Plot twist , John wick shows up at the end with the kitty cat bracelet.
As if that doesn't look like the maddest movie in this whole fucking world
That was nice but I can't believe they compared this movie fighting with actually martial art techniques that's were used in John Wick.
I am the nobody who knocks
Incredible
Saul Goodman meets John Wick? I dig it
Great great trailer!
So They are creating a whole “John Wick” Universe now with other characters involved in, so excited on this! Maybe Bob will help John in JW 4.
2:26 "GIVE THE GOD DAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET"
Найшуллер красава. Всех наших пристроил. :)
Yes.alll the yes
Oh my God I feel like a little girl. I'm so happy I could cry
If he gets caught does he call Saul?
This looks BRUTAAAAAAAAAAAAALL
NOOO NOT THE KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!
Make it part of the John Wick universe and we have ourselves a deal.
In theatres only 🤣 during covid 🤣
Better call nobody
Aaaahhh! They should've saved that twist for the movie, kept me  engaged about how he beat those guys until they revealed he is ex-con/army something
Ever since Mike died Saul had to be both lawyer and cleaner
OMFG! This is the BoB O i have been waiting for!!!!!!
Anybody know the name of the song in this trailer???
This is what right casting is... ITs like Mr. Nobody could not be anyone else...
dad wick
They have just jumped the shark on this one. Saul vs 600. How does a guy go from being tied up every third episode by a cartel or gang to a killing machine. Back in the day you knew that terrifying monsters like Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein were going to meet their demise when they made a film with Abbott and  Costello. John Wick  is being copied to death. The reason franchises as Wick work is that there is a background to make you care about the protagonist. Saul meet Abbott and Costello.
Better Call + John Wick with a hefty dash of A History of Violence? Count me in!
"Who The Fuck Are You?" "I’m A Guy That Knows Another Guy Who Knows Another Guy."
looks so cheap
"In theatres only Feb.26" So you don't want to make any money whatsofuckingever?
Saul Goodman just started Knocking.
Is like he made the same movie but different people
I'm already looking forward to Bob and John Wick crossover.
Nobody is Hutch Mansell.... BUT... Fucking Nobody is always John Wick...
nice and pulpy
The better call saul’s sequel lookin’ real good!
"in theatres only Feb 26" well I was looking forward to seeing it until I heard that 🤣 hellll no
"In theaters only..."  Yeah, good luck with that.
Damn. Ba Bodenkirk turned out to be a badass.
John wick: I killed them, I killed them all being a boogeyman.  Bob: I did too being a Nobody.
Basically john wick with comedy                  I FUCKING LOVE IT😆
John Wick : Where is my car? Nobody: Where is my kitty cat bracelet?    PS: Nobody is like a John Wick with wife and kids.
anyone knows the name of the music?
This is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Colin salmon is useless!
Incoming cringe nobody comments
So John Wick starring Saul Goodman interesting
Well, Soul had enough of legal practice and went out hard and sincerely.
is it in the same universe of jhon wick?? D:
Hopefully, it's in John Wick's universe.
I bet you this is in the same world as John Wick.  If the gold bullion at 2:04 is to go by at the least.
I love the look on the little girl's face at 1:30, like "my dad is going to kick ass"!
This what happens when Saul took on Wick as a client. Learned a thing or two.
Saul Goodman got mad I guess
This seemed awesome from the start, then the fight scenes came and it looked horribly scripted lol. Really bad choreography, but overall seems like the movie might still be good
Fuck theaters, NETFLIX
John wick but a familyman.
When Saul said "he knows a guy, who knows a guy that knows another guy", he meant this guy. 😂
It's look amazing
This is very good! But has anyone examined Simmy Krotiel's website? You can find a method he suggests to make your penis increase up to 4 inches within weeks, with no taking any kind o strange supplements or applying pumps hahaha.
Nobody:     Literally Nobody:
Better call Saul just got crazy
"In theaters only" lol yeah ok good luck with that
This is a really well done trailer. I'm excited to see this!
If it comes from producers of John Wick. Doesn't that mean it exists in the same universe?
2:37 OH BABY A TRIPLE
WOW
Браво!)
This is the movie i never thought i needed.
So the guy who did Hardcore Henry is doing John Wick now...I can dig it
Finally he's sending people to Belize himself
Very good
I thought it will be like John Wick parody.        I'm wrong.
he better call Saul.
Bob odenkirk is the best actor for this
Did jesse do that?  Yeah.... but you gotta understand deep down he loves me
Anyone know the song...
Another underrated movie loading!!!
John wick kills everyone for a Dog.... Nobody kills everyone for Kitty cat bracelet!
1:44 who the hell trained these guys how to clear a room
Nobody inspired by Arya Stark.. I mean nobody..
2:37 he quick scoping and got a Triple Kill 😳
This is like  What if John wick had a family
SAUL WAS THE ONE WHO SENT TO KILL THE F*CKIN BOOGEYMAN!
Ha ha, Beta fantasies are taking over the movies! when their Star Wars franchise turns out to be a dud and super hero movies are played out then they start making movies where their lazy asses are turned into Skywalker superheroes ha ha. worst generation ever.
The police officer is jimmy from john wick😂😂
What if... John wick had a family
Copycat of kathi movie fight scene
Holy shit!!
"who ? that fucking nobody ? " "And that fucking nobody is John wick"  "Who the fuck are you ?" "I am Nobody"  Hence, NOBODY = JOHNWICK
It's a bomb and im waiting for it❤️
Fuck cant wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👐
Anyone for a John Wick / Nobody crossover......say yes through likes.... 👇🏼
The song being used in the Trailer is I'm Just a Gigolo by Louis Prima
A History of Violence + John Wick = this.  And yes I will see it, thank you.
I guess i watched the whole movie in this trailer 😧
This actually looks unreal haha
BACKGROUND SONG - LOUIS PRIMA "JUST A GIGOLO"
probably in the same universe as john wick
Nce
Basically Jhon Wick with a Family....But still, I'll watch Jimmy's badass side!!!!!!
That's when Saul became Heisenberg
Cop:Who the fuck are you  Im nobody ❤️
Is that the watchman guy???
Bang Bang 😎🔥
Saul Unleashed!
My man Bob is so underrated... Give him a goddamn Emmy already people!!!
This is a John Wick movie, only for adults older 60.
Absolutely amazing, Can't wait to see 😮
Nobody
I love toxic masculinity
For 12 years I worked with very dangerous people.....  And they are our Walter , jesse and Gus and mike 😂😂😂🏃
I love this .... Give me the goddamn kitty bracelet. Come on y'all stole a child's bracelet how pathetic lol
It's all good man
So John Wick if his wife didn’t die of cancer and he had a family?
Reject attorney, embrace the armory.
Matlab...maza aa gaya..🔥🔥...
Wow. Kevin Costner really making a comeback!
Me : the next John Wick? *Also* *me* : *No* *the* *first* *Nobody* 💯💯
Jimmy about to finish what walter white started
wish this was under the John Wick universe
Chuck would be so pissed off watching Jimmy with a machine gun
That's if cinemas will still be around by then.
*2:26* All this for a *Kitty Cat Bracelet..*
It is a good action movie, BUT could or does he not have the history of good normnal citizen from better call Saul ? but ok, i have to change my mindset.
The "Salamanca's" are in big trouble.
It would be awesome if this movie was in the John wick universe
"Sleeping Jimmy" turns "Ass kicking Jimmy"
John wick meets Red.i am so hyped
What's that song??
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACELET
Saul's a shit-kicker!! I WANNA SEE THIS BLOODY FILM!!!
sauls to the walls
2:27 - oh, yep. Suddenly on his side.  I hope she gets her bracelet back.  Might be best to clean the blood off it first.
East  or west John wick is best
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays in the background?
The high table is summoning you
After a long time, there is something worth watching
in theatres only.... pass
This is my jam. Get out of the way Valentine's Day...
Fatman, J.Wick and Nobody connected universe!
Expansion of john wick universe, they will connect john wick and this movie
What pinball table is that?
Is this the same setting as John Wick?
please oh please tell me this story is in john wick's universe
the title was supposed to be John Fist
You know what? I'm gonna see it. In theaters. That's right, I'm gonna risk my life to see this because it looks Damn good.
What is it a spin off of JOHN WICK series Still Waiting for it ....
Wickverse is happening.
On a vu tout le film là...

Wooooya👌👌
He's our saul goodman!
Feels like I already saw the movie.
👍🏻
Only on theaters  Me-- 🤣😂😂😂😂 that's a good one
Saul is back!
Don’t call 911 😷
“In theaters only” Covid: *Am I a joke to you?*
Guess Saul 'Good-man' is finally Breaking really 'Bad-man' here. Just wish we see a cameo by Heisenberg or Pink-man.
Thalaivan incharge endrum Thani route!!!!!
So he is Jhon wick with family still alive.
John Wick Movie Poster: Exists Nobody Movie Poster: It'S nOt sAmE, tHey HAd GUNS, wE hAvE PunChEs. iT lOOks sAmE bUt It's NoT🤥.
Looks great!   Not sure about the Theatre only release....not a gud idie iMO.  Better on Netflix!
There is only one act that must dissolve the totality of the conditioning. So that the brain has to face this fact, that though it has been shaped in the process of time and now it’s facing a challenge, which says think and act totally differently, which is not of time.
Is the brother of John Wick 🤣🤣🤣
February 26 in theaters or mean to say available Disney+
Sooo.. basically Red but family edition
2:08 GTA
When you are in trouble, better call saul
uh oh! "Toxic Masculinity!!"
Song???
ooooohhhhhh yeah....cant wait
This could have been amazing!.. But the trailer gave it all away and this script has been done soooo many times. How are hollywood writers so bad and afraid to write new scripts? Give me something new.
God, this looks like shit
Wow❤️ Just Amazing 🙏🇮🇳
"That fucking nobody?" "That fucking Nobody is John Wick..'s brother Saul"
That's saul goodman
When Jimmy became John Wick
Fuck yeah!!
John Wick: "Better Call Nobody"
Set in the John Wick universe?
Very good cliche but I'm hyped for this 🔥🔥 and Bob fkin Odenkirk🔥
Just awesome
another BS movie from neanderthal (hollywood)
good :)
Don't you tell me Serebryakov will actually get a decent role, even if it's cliché like Russian mafia boss (actual Russians for Russian mob, finally)
Anyone already thinking of John Wick and Mr.Nobody crossover???...would be a hell of a ride.
Imagine them at the continental.  John: You working again? Mr Mansell: Nah just sorting some stuff out.
What’s the song in the trailer???
At first i thought this was going to be a spoof of John Wick...but yeah ok... nobody whatever 🤷🏻‍♂️
Nobody: ...
So John Wick but w a family.
Yeeeeeeeah Bob, loviu ❤️
"Better call Saul"
Total rip off from John Wick ?
It’saul good man
I hope he stops by The Continental.
🔥🔥
awesome saul goodman
.. and then he and John Wick met.
Taken+John WIck.
Batman: Ever read "The Odyssey"? After Odysseus was caught by the cyclops, he told it his name was "Nobody." So when he poked its eye out and its friends asked who did it, all the cyclops could say was, "nobody."
Good news is they didn't kill his dog, probably because he didn't have one.  Bad news, they mess with his family.
this Christmas, home alone with John Wick
What's the name of the song playing???????
In theaters ONLY.  what the fuck is the point of that. Wasted opportunity.
Nobody  Officiel trailer :
At the end of the movie  "phone ringing"  John wick: I need your help  Hutch: "tossing the gold coin"  Hutch: count me in
Can someone tell what song it is
John Wick's Brother
Good thing they didn't kill his dog.
Good Russian actor as villain. Not bad.  "An give this man a gun." ;)
John Wick, but in dadbod
Nobody, does it better than Saul Goodman.
fuck yes!!! i guess they are gonna settle it outside of court....
Saul Wick
Gordon Ramsey as a Villain?? Hell yeah!!
Now this looks badass. I would love to see a version of this in a black family. If there’s already been that, hit me up.
Yessssss!
Song name please ???
I am more excited for this than I was for John wick 😍
Wow
Calling David Leitch just a producer of John Wick is the most aggregious slight in a trailer. The man did Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and Hobbes and Shaw. Not to mention Co-Directing John wick with Chad Steleski. He's an action directing God.
That fucking nobody is JOHN WICK!!!
#UnexpectedLouisPrima
John Wick universe
*Who the fuckin Nobody *That Fuckin Nobody Is Hutch 🔥
0:54 never ever call old man a old man
They should have put Rhea Seehorn also.
So this is John Wick after he retires a second time to start a family, huh?
What is the soundtrack?
That POV gun scene though😩
OMG!!!Saul Goodman
OLD WICK
*John Wick's brother from another mother!*
Better Call John Wick
Look Like  Indian Movie " Viswaroopam"
looks too much like John Wick
I thought fast & furious univers
John Wick meets Saul Godman
*I hope this is in the same universe as John Wick!*
looks really good nice+
"In Theaters Only February 26" … you wish.
kitty cat braces <3
John Wick:  Nobody scares me..  No really that nobody guy.
Cool
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN KITTY CAT BRACLET! That had me rolling 🤣🤣
Fuck yeah
Movie looks dumb
This looks AMAZING!
This is literally the same plot as John Wick, and yet I'm perfectly ok with that. They seem to be poking some fun with the similarities as well (Kitty Cat Bracelet, cmon that's gold). I'm totally down to see this, and Bob Odenkirk is a seriously underrated actor
goddammit!
Is this part of the John Wick universe or a new project?
Илья, красавчик! Надо смотреть! ))
Did anybody else sit through this entire ad?
So this is like John Wick movie but with a family?
2:37 collateral...
I am the lawyer of the one who knocks 🔥
I want to see this.
Сол Гудмэн = Джон Вик! Интересно)

Olderb John Wick
Ding ding ding ding  -Hector salamanka
Nobody! Maybe he lost his passport ,money and his identity card between Turkey and greece border!?
NoBody told us John Wick got a Pal....
Записываю Найшуллера в хорошие режиссёры. Выглядит интересно и сочно. Хардкор скорее эксперимент, чем хороший фильм с бюджетом.
Илья, Шикарная работа! Я снова хочу к тебе на площадку!
Garbage
This we need it action 🎬 🙌
John wick needs to team up
Saul Badman  Join Sakamoto family
Oh fuck, that's awesome🔥🔥🔥
End credits scene: Nobody receives a call from John Wick.
That fucking nobody is Bob Kirk. They call him Baba Yaga lite
This is the moment Saul become Nobody
Espectacular👍historia diferente con acción increible😲
Well, his big difference from John Wick is that he has baggages to think about. And surely, he also has issues.
So this is John Wick with a family and without dog....
"Who the fuck are you?" "Me? I'm sAul Goodman"
Dammit Saul! You did it again!!! Hahaha! Feb 26th. Marked! :-)
Sooo death wish basically but hell I’ll still watch it
...so suburban john wick
glad to see in this movie and wish you guys good luck!!1 Aleksandr Pal (Gorko! 2013 aka Kiss Them All! ) Aleksei Serebryakov (lot of the movies) and this Ilya Naishuller guy as Director (Hardcore Henry 2015)
This looks lit, ngl
Bad Russians again... Well at least they hired actually good russian actors... Ps. Ah, Ilya Naishuler at a steering wheel, now I understand.
legit same plot line as John Wick except he's less assuming.
This looks awesome. From the director of Hardcore Henry? This is gonna be good...
So... is this John Wick universe expansion??
2:47 I'm Saul Goodman, bitches.
Saul Wick
1:20. What was that soundtrack
Saul Goodman??
"Don't Call 911" "I Know a guy who know a guy"
Only in FEBRUARY?! Noooo you cant drop this trailer and make me wait 3 months! I want Ass Kicking Saul for Xmas!!!!!
Better Call Wick
We need a crossover with John Wick
Its all good man
End credits  John wick : hey,bob  can i leave my dog at your place for one night Bob: yeah, john
Every character in breaking bad is master piece
Nice to see actors break type-casting
Too cliché, bye. Even the coolness of the protagonist was copied, K. Reeves=Saul
Isnt this a sequel to something? I remember that exact beginning shot from when I was a kid.
Wow. Great trailer!  Can't wait to see it.
If this is what breaking bad is as a series then its amazing.
Найшуллер снова убил Паля?
Gene Takavic - The Movie
Better Call Saul
For those who might be interested, the song used in the background is "I Ain't Got Nobody" by Louis Prima. Though, it's been amped up significantly with the epic score!
Saul Goodman isnt fuckin around.
Nobody:  Me: Hey look it's the person every dam YouTube comment mentionsin their jokes...
John wick is better
Can I just say... NOW THATS A TRAILER!!!
R rated home alone
SAUL GOODMAN 🔥🔥🔥
Jhon wick brother but for 20 bucks and a gun
Honestly it's kinda weird seeing Bob Odenkirk do action movies lol
Movie kinda feels like Better Call Saul meets John Wick lol
Omg I want to see this so bad lmao
Liam Neeson did it first 👀
Better call the " OLD MAN ".
I like this movie!!!
In theatres? What theatres? The chicken left has gotten them all closed!
11 de dezembro dia mundial do trailer
Now this is Death Wish!!! not Bruce Willis bullshit
This looks sick Amazing actor Deserves to be the main role in films
I don't know, John Wick's gonna be a hard one to top
I'm half expecting for when he is overpowered he is just taken to the desert with Gustavo.
Ha ha, Lov it...
Es una versión paralela de la vida de John Wick 😅😅😅😅 aquí la esposa sobrevivió y conformaron una familia 😃
If is in the same universe , this movie is screaming for a John Wick crossover.
We’re still showing the whole movie in the preview? What happened to good trailers where they don’t spoil the movie
hope they release this online asap
Uff.... Now I can say that there's actually a pretty cool Action movie going to be released soon.
It's like *liam neeson movies*  _What's happening ?_ *DON'T CALL 911* _This movie seems to me_  *Like death wish* _To Bruce Willis_
DId I JUST SEE THE FUCKING RZA GET A TRIPLE KILL WITH A SINGLE SHOT ..... YEP THATS THE RZA
John Wick + Joker = Nobody
That fucking nobody is JOHN WICK
thank you for making this film.
Damn that looks intense!
https://youtu.be/z-z3SEGKCrQ Top 10 subscribed channels in Kerala This will definitely surprise you
Watch this mind relaxing village video for having a relaxing mind  https://youtu.be/HIPdFTSWXAU 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
This better be good Paul, or even your better call saul reputation cant save you
John wick: Revenge for a dog.... Nobody: Give me the fucking kitty kat...
Better Call Saul~
John Wick looks different
Bob Odenkirk: I will NOT be typecast!
Well I guess I don’t have to go see it because I just watched it all in the trailer.
Short but very special  video must watch 😎😎"the blind beggar"   https://youtu.be/KkCOaoMmC-M
Is this John wick's father??
Once you get old you gain a particular set of skills 😎👊🏾😁
Hell yeah!!
And Now Saul is trained to take lalo Salamanca🙄
please get a crossover of this and jhon whick would love to see saul goodman and keanu reeves together 🖤🖤
What’s the soundtrack?
"i know a guy who knows a guy whom maybe knows John"
The YouTube thumbnail to this video looked like Chris D’Elia
Better don't call Saul.😎
Wtf- my first impression was of a slow burning thriller and a chance of him turning into a serial killer or something but this is literally john wick pirated version lmao
Pretty sure we just saw the whole movie.  What a shame, no surprises left.
Looks good, but I really hoped for a more nuanced and deeper storyline about a regular family man who changes his life after that incident of robbery(?) at his own house. The start of the trailer looked so promising! :(
Saul Goodman's part time job.
Jimmy McGill knows a guy who knows another guy who knows another guy. They're too much dangerous
Bob saw John Wick during quarantine and was like " I wanna do that!"
Ohhh John Wick  Again....
Shit looks bad ass
Keanu Reeves looks differently
yes fucking please
Extras https://youtu.be/ST7ebI2QIZ8
Saul!!
Okay..finally mike is reborn!
Anyone noticed LIke Hindi Bollywood song Playing in between....
To beat the shit out of goons....Better call Saul and Walter White
John wick 2.0 version
Omg, Bob Odenkirk is on fire!! Definitely going to see this!
From Mafia's lawyer to Mafia's killer.... Saul has come a short way!!....
Editor : How much movie do you want in the trailer???  The Director : Yes
dude got tired of defending criminals so he became one himself!
John Wick from alternative universe :D
To think that after finishing better call saul my initial thoughts were of him in a john wick like movie, and how badass it would be, and to have it happen a couple of months later is like opening an early Christmas gift
I hope that little girl gets her kitty cat bracelet back
I guess a lot of Western 35-60 men that don't have much to "protect" their family from will find this movie appealing. John Wick for grownups?
Song???
Better Call Nobody!
Who else though that old guy was Mike? xD
John wick with a living family!
Just like me NOBODY. Literally.
Man went and got a triple collateral
This is the John wick that had a family
How I Met your Mother anyone? 😁
What song is this?
Its FUCKING AMAZING!!!
Now I remember why I don't watch trailers.
Saul turn into White
Make him John wick's partner in John wick 4.
MSM fake news ccp propaganda arm ❤Trump❤ said "they might not even be human "he's right there 🐍horoc🐍 sound/bells can reveal them for their true form they are afraid of fire only a master of the ⚡light⚡ can bind them in human form 🐍horoc🐍 have 🐷p3dophi1ia🐷tendencies feed on the frytend on the blood and fear of the lamb of 2 legs  they take over people in powerful places sound/bells can reveal them for their true form many evil people in powerful places are not human beings they are horoc (Biden,Hillary,Obama) not human beings they are horoc they smell like sulfur and rotten meat every one start using bells around all of the evil people you will see them turn into thar true form... horoc show the world what they are
ေကာင္းတယ္ေနာ္
Super 🤘
I very much wish that this is within the John Wick movie universe.
I just saw the poster for this today on Reddit, this trailer clinches it. I'm so hype.
<<<<< So Scary...
Better NOT call Saul
1:13 when the kbab music kicks in...
Все говорят про Одинкёрка, а я просто рад видеть Паля в Голливуде.
If this starts a John Wick/ Nobody crossover, I'm going to lose my fucking mind
I think this will be quite amusing
For a second I was like "Rick?"
He really got crazy after he went away at the end of Breaking Bad
You are soul
Nobody is awesome!!!!
A history of violence meets John Wick and a bit of The accountant
I know you didnt know John Wick had a brother.
0:28 that’s totally a Wexler-McGill mug
That bus scene is so fucking unrealistic, Busman would come out his thing and beat all of them to shit if it happened irl
Saul Badman
Imagine if this is for a potential John Wick universe.
That f***n' nobody is John... Err Nobody!
Please release in India in hindi 🙏
Everyone know you do not take the kitty cat bracelet, rookie mistake.
A stolen kitty cat bracelet=God help us all
storyline is better call saul becomes the joker becomes john wick
This is basically a John Wick clone
For Odenkirk i will risk my familys health and goto the theatres for this movie
The company of Walter White did him good.
fuck yeah!
Soul goodman is back in action
That looks freat
did anybody else notice the "WM" cup odenkirk's drinking from? ;))
The backstory to happy
Walter White may be the one that knocks but Jimmy McGill is the one that knocks DOWN
Don't call 911😝
Better call Saul...
Repeat never mess with the guys from breaking bad👍😁
I’m watching
It's just John wick with wife and kids
Damn Saul...
Moral of the story - "Saul is Nobody".
JONH WICK OLD VERSION
wow
Dog kitty kat bracelet jesus whats next?....a duck!!
2 Words Cross Over
Its kinda John Wick spin-off movie. Well, I might ready myself for a John Wick universe...
yeah
it’s adult kickass
0:41 I thought it was Jonathan Banks a.k.a. Mike
Waiting for the Henry cameo
This movie and john wick franchise should collaborate
A history of violence 2.0
he better call hi twin after this one.
Crazy and awesome .. 👏👏👏👏
Can't wait to see him cross over with John Wick
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes! I've been waiting for a good reason to back to the cinema, and this is it!
Holy fucking shit Bob Odenkirk on xgames mode
*Nobody* : *hey* *John* , *what* *you* *got* ? *John* : *A* *✏️* *John* : *what* *about* *you* ? *Nobody* : *a* *baseball* *bat*
Should be called “Republican Wet Dream”
John wich and him will team up
Looks like he's in some sort of trouble... ... maybe he better call Saul...
I hope he meet john wick
SAULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
This looks great
Oh gracious lol
Saul Wick?
plot twists. theaters stil closed on feb 26th in most of the united states due to coivd 19 in 2021
Better Not F*ck With Saul
I mean, it looks cool, but the main actor doesn't perform the action very well, at least from the look of the trailer
I am only thinking of watching this movie because of Bob Odenkirk
I liked music.
WHY do they have to give so much away in the trailers, FFS
This is john wick right?
This’ll be sick!!! Loved the John wick series.
Fuck Yeah!
Didn't I already see the beginning of this trailer somewhere?
This guy, John wick and the equalizer all need a movie together. Now
But i want to see some humour in that too!
What a great film. Can't wait for the trailer.
There’s a specific lawyer he should call for help...iykyk
is it the same universe as john wick ?
They stole my daughters Kitty-Kat bracelet, so Yeah! I'm thinking I'm Back!!
Finally a trailor true to its meaning - i hope Mr Nobody better call saul for help
So are we all not going to address the gold coins turning into gold bars for this movie @ 2:01 lol...This is like the comedic version of " John wick"  Maybe Saul is his uncle or brother-in law in the same universe lol
This is so fun. 😯
What's the name of the song ?
Hey please ruin the movie and show all the best parts, so I can put together an idea of the story, in the 2 minutes "trailer".
Movie 🎥-: Nobody Comments 💬 -: Breaking bad & Better call saul
Amazing
isn't this film somewhat similar to jason statham's homefront?
Did my man just hit a triple collat?
*Happy Heisenberg noises*
Sadly, Nobody was far better in his use of violence.  He was so fast and powerful, that he only had to show off what he COULD do to you if he got angry.  He intimidated people with a friendly smile and some slapstick comedy in the face of danger.  Terence Hill as Nobody.
RIP Pewdiepie. Pewdiepie jumps in lava  https://youtu.be/qal9WDPWoBQ .. ..
"That fucking NOBODY... is Saul Goodman."
john wick: dog nobody: kittykat
freeguy and nobody
This one is different
I wonder if they'll keep the "Baby bird in the cow pie" story.
My Name is Nobody.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RYq1PLdT0s
This guy resembles Michael from GTA V. He has a wife, a son, a daughter, a big house, and guns galore. Plus the story sounds the same. But he sounds like Trevor tho.
Jimmy McGill from the inside after he gets fed up of the printing room and decides to be a lawyer
This is almost exactly The Equalizer's plot....I can't be the only that sees this
Well sh*t didn’t see that coming.
this is the man Saul needs on his payroll
Its saulgoodman
damn! This is why you should not watch a trailer.
Honestly, this looks incredible
Waiting John wick 4❤️ Nobody Rocks
John wick ka bhai aa gaya
I feel like this trailer was a bit TOO generous
Yay, a rated R movie. Yay it's badass odenkirk. Nay that the rated R has to be a violent action movie. It still looks entertaining.
C'mon  America  -   get  more  violent -  that's  what  we  want !  We  want  u  to  be  violent  we  want  you  to  be  overstimulated  we  want  to  bombard  u  with  so  many  news  stories that  u  wont  know  whats  real  or  fake we  want  to  oversexualize  ur  children and  we  want  to  quarantine  You   - then  give  you  a vaccine .
Next John wick
Илья красавчик! За  Серебрякова в белом, отдельное спасибо!
Jon wick: finally a worthy opponent NOBODY
РУССКИЕ ЗДЕСЬ!
1:12  2:09 Did no one notice an indian song ???
If there ever is a Max Payne movie being made , this dude would be a great fit!
Next JW
_Uh oh_ Jimmy and his chicanery again.
Yeah so this looks like deathwish+john wick. Great..  Awesome. ...can't wait  So happy. Fucking hollywood blows
Next John Wick 😳
"Who are you?" "Saul Goodman"
Me: He's One Punch M.... Mr.: Who..? Me: Noo.......Nobody Mr.: Hmm.
Felt so good hearing "In theaters only" considering the current circumstances.
Конечно же Паля опять убьют. Спасибо, Найшуллер.
man this is  just fucking.............awsome,.....
saul goodman was mike ehrmantraut in another life
You Know!! You better call Nobody.!!
I Think  it Will  be an entertaining movie...
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen!! Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Better call Saul season 6 looks cool😁
What was the song name in this trailer??
Finally! a movie that actually looks like its telling a story, not just a cash grab
ok this could be BAD ASS!
How is no one mad at this? Its a john wick rip off, yet i cant wait to see it.
Saul Wick
John Wick if he settled down and started a family :D
Bob Odenkirk is getting better everytime...
Heisenberg messed with the wrong guy..
He must be a member of The Faceless Men.
At the End  Bob = John I need help  John = Bloddy Marker 🔥 Boy&Cat playing at the back 😂
Saul Wick
"Better call nobody"                - Nobody to his family members.
gUyS iTs bEtTeR cAlL SaUl iSn’t ThAt fUnNy?!?!??
John Wick : Wanna see what I can do with a pen Nobody : Wanna see what I can do with a kitty cat bracelet
Can't wait for the Saul Goodman skin in fortnite!
just saw this trailer with Cudi's new song "Tequila Shots" and it's got me so hyped for this film!
time when we used to watch good movies instead of marvel superhero crap
Combined with this and John Wick, it seems there's a coming trend of assassins trying to retire and being forced out of retirement due to threats to their loved ones, to remind those coming against them *why* they were so dangerous. Don't know how good this movie will be, but I, for one, welcome this trend.
❤️🔥
Ooo Dean noooo!!!!
You like Better Call Saul? You like John Wick? Oh boy do I have the movie for you.
This is literally a new skin for john wick. I LOVE IT
Alternative title: a comedian plays john wick
John wick if his wife didn't die.
😳
It would be pretty exiting if it was connected to the John wick universe wouldn’t it
jimmy got lead role because he knows a guy who knows a guys who knows other guy
"that fucking nobody is saul goodman"
Nobody:  Nobody
Ummmmmm yes please?
Nobody: Kitty cat John wick: Dog  A collab between these two looking for revenge on their pets would be awesome.
John Wick: he killed my dog Nobody: he stole my kitty cat bracelet
imagine a crossover with john wick.   John: What'd they take?  Nobody: A cat bracelet, you?  John: Yep.
Mannnn.... well at least they didn’t kill his dog :)
Daddy Wick !!!
THIS is what a REAL LAWYER should do...

Police- who are you? Mr. Nobody- I am nobody! John wick- Collab with me Mr. NoBody in my upcoming movie 😎
A cross between John Wick and Liam Neeson
Love this guy, great actor
Jimmy Wick then?
At least they got the title correct because "Nobody" going to see it going directly to the theaters....
mitski?!???
This movie is directed by the guy who made Hardcore Henry!
A dark take of Saul Goodman's original story!    Edit: I never watched Better Call Saul or Breaking Bad but the comment is kinda fun!
We better get q better call saul reference
This look dope and it comes out on my birthday
I love how the poster resembles the John Wick 2 poster but Saul is getting his ass handed to him in this one lol
Looks like Max Payne in the thumbnail.
I was sold about 30 seconds in.
Who are you? 🎵Nobody, He's nobody, He's nobody 🎵  😂😂😂
Hell yes, I want to see that.
John Wick: Post retirement.
Saul in action!!!!!
I will watch this
Whats the name if the song and artist 1:13
John Wick but he's a sad middle aged dad instead.
February 2021: Nobody comes to the cinemas...  Well that's a tricky statement. Should I be happy or afraid now?!  Would like to watch the movie.
So great to see him getting in the spotlight more and more!
What’s the songs name?
If Keanu shows up at end credits....
So ..yeah..Bob has been working out and I’m here for it ❤️❤️
Dad Wick
Yep , typical gang, all white. Hollywood is so racist. Why are the bad guys always white??? I'm sick of that bull sht!
Can’t wait !
In theaters? Only???????? No way, josè!!!!!!
Saul Goodman delivering speedy justice for you when the courts are closed. xD
We need a John Wick cameo in this
Damn James
That f***ing nobody is not John Wick !
This is his new life. Saul Badman
Okay, i just saw the whole movie. In 3 minutes.
Amazing use of Louis Prima.
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.  ...............
Lol The Bus scene is literally just the Joker
Chris evans light pro max
The boss is just HUEL
this trailer just left my jaw dropped on floor, wt fooook
At the end, he is questioned without a LAWYER! Better call Sau
Saul Wick!
John Wick Spin-off?
Is it just me, or would this have been better if he hadn't been an "auditor"?  I mean, why bother with all the "should've done something" and "he's just a nobody" if he used to do this kinda stuff already, therefore, not a nobody?
I'm pretty sure i watched this twice already when that guy that's in cyberpunk 2077 starred in it
Gene Takovic 5 years down...
Finally, some real fucking content! So sick of the whole "Women smart, men dumb" cliche. Top it all off with the fact that he's a good father. Brilliant. Leftist critics are going to be all over this like flies on shit. Fuck em.
OMG a NON woke, non politic infested movie feom hollywood?  My faith has been temporarily renewed in humanity.  This actually looks good.
Lemme guess will this tie into John wick cuz everything is a share universe these days
Somebody should have called Saul before he got pissed
This is jimmy mcgill in alternate universe
Guy: I need a lawyer His lawyer:
Prefection
John wick with a family
Saul Goodman finally broke bad.
Okay ..... So this is the old version of John Wick 😍😍😍😍
Congrats mr. Bob Odenkirk.  That flick looks hot and been waiting for something special to come your way,  long over due. Cant wait!
🔥🔥
yess, pls
*"Happy!" meets "John Wick"*
All I see is sall Goodman right now
Well till John Wick next part is coming we can enjoy that .
Isn't this just History of Violence 2?
This is so good
Finally. A movie about a frustrated, 'over-correcting' Gen-Xer.:D
Is he from John Wicks universe??
You know as hype as I am already, I really, really hope they cut this so there's zero indication that this guy has any history, any skills at all... Right up until he dumps the revolver on the bus. Really make him agonize over taking the gun, make him handle it like he's terrified of it, right up until he shows it's not the GUN he's afraid of
Looks great Jimmy
I was with the trailer until it got all action-ee
This is why you better call Saul
So this is totally in the John Wick universe
This is just John Wick but with Bob Odenkirk instead of Keanu Reeves
2:37 mans got a triple collateral final killcam
That lasts https://youtu.be/xosrw4Z-ZNY
If you had told me a few years ago the guy who was half the team from Mr. Show and sleazy lawyer from Breaking Bad would turn out to be the next big bad ass action anti-hero I would have scoffed, but here we are. Bob Odenkirk for the win.
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy. Nobody
I hope this movie and John wick are in the same universe tbh
If he was a master assassin in the past, then he's not a nobody right?
I need JOHN WICK TOO !!! I need now !!
So John wick if he had a family and it was an action comedy. I dig it
So ready
Good job jimmy
Lol when keanu gets too expensive
So same universe as john wick nice
Is this a parity of John wick? I still like it though
John wicks brother. I like it
HOLY!!! the action, story and tropes all look so original!
is this part of the breaking bad universe tho?
Looks like a kick ass film nobody a similar vibe to John wick franchise and hardcore Henry
Holy shit it’s literally Saul Goodman meets Walter white
A spin-off of John Wick?? Sign me up.
Kevin Costner new movie
Wtf? ok I'm down. Bring  that movie
- Who tf are you? - I'm just a guy, who knows a guy, who knows another guy
I love these 'bad things happening to bad people' revenge movies.
Wouldn't be great if they reveal that this is part of the John Wick universe at the end of the film?
จิ้กวอน ดี้บอโน 😬✌️🥰
Im All In Bob !!!
Who... the fucking nobody? That nobody.... is Bob Odenkirk
2:37   "Ohhh baby a triple. Oh yeah."
Can this be the start of some kind of Wickverse
I need a Saul and John Wick collab, like, right now! 😱
What if? John wick's wife was alive.. hmm..
Нормальное мессиво)
‘A retired hit man takes revenge after his daughters kitty cat bracelet is stolen in a burglary’
Is that Saul
Damn they made a movie named after the most pathetic excuse for a meme
Saul Goodman going  John Wick is everything I never knew I needed.
From the producers of John Wick.....comes a movie about a hero who come out of retirement when some Europeans mess with him and......oh it's basically the same story as John Wick
This trailer started as every dude's "what if I got mugged" daydream and then became very very "ex-military/FBI/special forces" cliche very very fast.
Jim Wick
John wick 4
0:28 He's drinking from a Wexler McGill cup.
Song: Louis Prima - I ain’t got Nobody
But t hats the same dude who worked at the hotel isnt it
Ahhh rated r movie 😤
This all happened cuz Walter spared his life.. instead of dumping him in an acid barrel..
Give .e the kitty kat now
Is this like a John Wick Cinematic Universe? If so I would REALLY dig it.
Lalo salamanca: I'm gonna head out of here..
Imagine if ge he said.. I'm Saul Good man.. nice to meet u now get out of that fuckin room, i need ah talk with my client...
My only fans 😍 https://onlyfans.com/rissy_6969
John wick older brother.
dont call 911, better call saul
I want to see this but I don't see anyone going to no theaters during a pandemic
Поздравляю Илью!
This looks amazing.
well I never thought bob would be the next john wick what the FUCK
Name of the song?
Yes, Bob!
Whats hte name of the song
ik its from the makers of john wick but this is exactly the same, only his wife is alive
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Jimmy McGill goes hardcore Henry mode.
If john wick wife didn't died and he leave a normal life 😂
What if this took place in the John wick universe that’d be dope
This movie is gonna be chicanery!! Lmao
So, basically, "John Wick except Helen never died from cancer, they start a family and live in a suburban home and no dog dies"?  ....yeah, I'm in.
Oh I am here for this!
What’s the name of the song?
Son : Dad you like shit Nobody: You should see the other guys
Those are some terrible muzzle flares But good plot
First of all, this looks cheesy as hell! I love it. Secondly, is this in the John Wick Universe???
Damn that Roll was for Liam Neeson
This is basically if they made the "Call an ambulance, but not for me" video, into a movie.
discount john wick
That fucking Nobody is Saul goodman..he is called to kill the fucking boogeyman
What did I just watched🤔?
Why am I getting john wick vibes?
What is the song
This is what Saul Goodman calls “The heavy hand of justice”
JIMBO
Looks pretty damn good
EASTER EGG 0:28  - - Wexler McGill Coffee Mug!
Let me think, where have I seen this story before?
Note to self, don't fuck with a stranger's dog or kitty....just don't!
This is one of those trailers that give away the whole movie
Saul went back to his Slippin Jimmy ways but with more grit.
*Saul is tired of Justice system...So he is taking law in his own hand* ✋  *Better call Saul*
00:28 Is that Wexler & Mcgill mug?
Maker of John wick... that's enough..❤️
If I didn't know Ilya Naishuller was directing this, the action would definitely make me think "Yeah, this is Naishuller's work"
Now this... Is Artillery Arthur...
I'm calling it... Same universe as john wick
This looks like it could potentially be set in the same world as John Wick...
1:46 Did he kill a man with a fucking KETTLE!?!
So Saul is John wick? Interesting 🤔
damn this is gonna be the new Fight Club for forty year old dudes
Ladies and gentlemen the inscape of Saul Goodman😈.
Whats the nane of the song ?
Looks like Bryan Callen
Even though this looks like a very well produced SNL skit, I'm all for it!!!
Cue JOHN WICK!!
damn, mike really trained saul

i love Alexander Pal
I'm watching this I love theses types of action movies and this year doesn't have good movies this is a good movie. I love John wick so I know I'll love this.
John Wick of red states?
Looks like Another Jhonwick batchmate🔥
That "nobody" is John Wick probably inspired this.
John Wick Fucked The Joker And Now We Got This
Those big hollywood punches in movie fights always take me out of it, looks promising otherwise.
Damn!
i know yall saw that triple colatiral
I watched Hardcore Henry the other day, and thought they should make more movies like that
OMG yes please! That trailer was almost better than sex!
1:37 daughters: yeahh my dads a badass
So he's John Wick's mentor?
From the director of Hardcore Henry too 👀
Boa noite, um filme emocionante e fabuloso. Adorei o vídeo.
This seems like an snl skit
This looks like an old fashioned nonsensical action movie with one of the best actors out there. Def can't wait to watch this one!
Weurd casting choice.
They couldnt  let John Wick be the only movie . SMH
2:19 2:26
Walter: I need a team of hit win to take down jack and his friends Saul: I am the hit man
This looks amazing. Had to watch the trailer twice.
Am I the only one trying to find the song at the end?
SAUL
No captions option? Just don’t give an F right?
Damn. Saul really is down bad
So, "A History of Violence" meets "John Wick." Hmmm, I'm not mad at it. Looks predictable but entertaining nonetheless
What is the song called
Badass saul!!!
Well, this just looks like good fun.
Same setting as John Wick?
클린트 이스트우드 오마주?
*He better call Saul after all these crimes*
Jeez. How many times are they going to make this movie....?
Saul Badman
This movie looks sick AF
Love it! Saul an action hero!
Why does this seem like an alt universe John Wick where his wife and dog weren't dead and 16 years into the future.
SAUL WICK
nice.. Saul goodman is breaking bad
This looks awesome!
Anyone else catch Bob Odenkirks coffee cup has WM... Like Wexler Mcgill from Better Call Saul... 😏
Nice of them to show the whole fucking movie!
What if Mr. Show did a parody of John Wick, but forgot to make it a comedy ...
First it was Slippin’ Jimmy, then James McGill, then Saul Goodman, then a Jean, now a Nobody, I WANNA WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!
This is some John Wick type shit and I am HERE FOR IT.
Челябинец в Голливуде, господа! Один из гопников в автобусе - Александр Паль :)
John wick; you killed my dog  Hutch;         Don’t call 911
Oh no, he broke too bad.
Looks awesome!
Babayaga!
Interesting casting choice
He went full Kevin Costner on this...
this remake of john wick looks amazing.
Saul after meeting Heisenberg
NObody NObody   Director - Better call saul
So this must be John Wick’s brother
New Mr Show looks good.
YEESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So basically A History of Violence x John Wick starring Saul Goodman..... Nuff said, I'm in.
bet that John Wick makes a cameo.
Yeah we'll see about "theaters only" 😂😂😂
2:37 found the CS:GO player.
Талантливые режиссёры уезжают из России. Правильно, у нас Министерство культуры хорошее кино не поддерживает.
Welcome home Mr. Rogers
I hope it's in John Wick "universe", and they will meet in the second one.
This is the exact same movie as John Wick made by the same people more or less? .  What is going on in Hollywood?
Please be in the same world as John Wick!
This has to be a spin-off of John Wick please let this cross-over with JW or even equalizer or the accountant
This...actually looks bitchin'.
Gotta watch that!
Who knew Terry Twillstein from Run Ronnie Run could kick so much ass.
2:37 Rey from The Last Jedi
Looks awsome
soy amigo del cartel
Okay, I buy it.
That fuckin NOBODY is...oh wait, it's a different movie?!
Trailer disney time gem
I am not in danger I am the danger
So it's like John Wick..with a wife and kids with humour haha
Keanu Reeves was busy doing cyberpunk I guess.
Okay, so Jimmy couldn’t work at Cinnabon anymore and decided to become Nobody and when they stole kitty kat bracelet, he goes full on John Wick mode.  Count me in!
anyone knows this song
Tell me it's in the same universe as John Wick!
Artellary Arthur
budget john wick?
why didn't this guy drive rambo 5?
"So Jimmy, have you thought any more about the job?" Jimmy:
Hyped
Looks good
"I once convinced a woman I was John Wick, and it worked because I believed it!"
👍👍👍
THE MAIN CHARACTER IS THE SAME GUY WHO AUDITIONED FOR MICHEAL SCOTT FOR THE OFFICE!!!
I'm so confused on this one.  Okay, this is not exactly the same trailer on Universal site.
that colat though!
Better Call  Saul, at least he can defend himself!
Name of the song?
Amazing!
So heres my elevator pitch to someone at hollywood.  John Wick The Equalizer and Nobody all go after thanos.  BOOM! Give me ten million dollars.
Dummies are gonna loooove this
If there is not a crossover movie after this where he teams up with John Wick then what are we even doing with our lives?
It's confirmed , this is gene's family 1:22
Better call Nobody
John Wick Senior Citizen Edition
Lalo is about to catch these hands
Well, I hope this connects with the John Wick Universe because if it does, it'll be epic
Snitches get stitches. Let's just deal with each other in the fun ways
"in theaters only" killed my excitement instantly.
That was nicely unexpected! Wish I never saw this trailer! :)
I wanna see a movie that parodies John Wick. We already have over the top action movies in the veins of John Wick,  Atomic Blonde and now this.
What a guy. He delivered that "nobody" line perfectly. Any other actor would've easily made it sound cheesy.
from John Wick:  "That fucking nobody, is John Wick"   🤷🏻
better call sakamoto days
Ohhh sheeiitt 😎
Original sinceramente.. !!!
Hope they didn't show all the action scenes. Gosh
When David Leitch's involved, we can be sure of one thing – the *Action* is gonna be *BADASS* !
I'm imagining  a Cinematic Universe of Hardcore Henry, John Wick and Nobody
2:45 Saul Goodman Motherfu*ker
John Wick on a budget.
"Don't Drink And Drive, But When You Do, Call Saul." 😁
Экшн сцена в автобусе, как же это по Найшулеровски
“It’s not what you did son that angers me so. It’s who you did it to.”  “Who the freaking nobody?”
Saul was just a cover. He was really the agent behind taking down the Salamanca cartel.
That was amazing.
THE LEGENDDDDD İS VERY GOOD
Looks like Ehrmantraut taught him well.
OK this looks awesome. John Wick but more experimental and comedic? Also Tobey Maguire is EPing this sooo... I have no idea what to make of that.
If John Wick had a family...
amazing
A duck approves
Better trailer here: https://youtu.be/0p1D5_MA4SE
1:33 he even got the john wick tone lmao..
I thought that was jonathan banks at first lol
Lol this is insane from Mr Show to THIS ! Looks alright though.
He's in trouble he better call saul
oh hhhhheeeellllll yes
OH MY GOD
What’s the name of the music?
Оденкерк, Паль, Серебряков, Найшуллер.... ммм... для полного счастья Лапенко в эпизоде не хватает)
Did the Hadron collider go off again?
Better Call Saul Wick
damm jimmy u finally broke bad
I’d watch it when it comes to Redbox because ain’t no fucking movie theater gonna be open by thatbtime
not a lot of restraint in this screenplay
It's not theatre material anymore but action is very good and the trailer
2021....looking GOOD MAN!
Looks like he's ready to break bad.
He's a "Criminal Lawyer" afterall.
LOVE THIS
Middled aged man who is quiet and unassuming but has a secret past that comes back to haunt him and has to use his vast military/tactical training that nobody knew he had in order to take on an entire army of the criminal underworld Starring actor who is already pretty established and because of this role will now be type casted into similar roles for the rest of his career
Wow, if Chris Evans never comes back as Captain America, Saul kind of looks like a middle-aged Cap...
When jimmy starts acting up       Better call mom
This is the moment that Saul became Heisenberg
This is exactly the type of trailer/movie Mr. Show would have made fun of.  It's pretty much Coupon, The Movie
"Who the f*ck are you?" "Me? I'm nobody." Roll credits!
Я конечно все понимаю, но зачем в трейлере показали весь сюжет и задумку фильма? (ну и драки тоже походу)
I would watch ANYTHING with Bob Odenkirk.  And this one looks pretty cool.
this is the moment James McGill became Heisenberg
In theaters only, yeah, good luck with that
This looks pretty great!
Does this take place in the John wick universe?
Gus left the chat =))
The poster looks 100% like the John Wick poster where they point a bunch of guns at Keanu's face... https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2016/10/John-Wick-Chapter-2.jpg
Universal : Who is going to watch this in theaters?        Corona : Nobody
So its for a kitty cat bracelet?   Fk yeah i'm in 🔥💯
Somebody: Nobody: Literally no one:  2021: Let the End Game Begins..
Bob Odenwick
Yeah, it's funny, but Bob doesn't sell it like Keanu.
damn Mr. Show is about to put one hell of a -show- shitstorm
I'd love an unofficial john wick cinematic universe
That was cathartic.
The badass lawyer
Don't fuck with Mr. Nobody and his daughter Kitty cats bracelet, I know a guy who knows a guy who know Mr. Nobody's name tho.
How I know Kim Wexler survives: If anything happened to her, Jimmy wouldn't become a criminal lawyer. He'd become this.
Looking forward to it
Looks 👍
So my man finally got a kickass role in movie 😎❤️🔥
Me: Breaks my mom China dish Mom: Don't call 911
The music?
Nobody:  Everybody: Ok, I am in.
Then who are you??? Hope you'd ask, I'm saul
Lol is this in the John wick universe?
U see older dudes in scenes like this that u don’t buy...but damn jimmy..I bought that bus fight.
Vigo: It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to. Iosef: Who? That fucking nobody? Vigo: That fucking nobody... is Nobody.
Wow this looks like garbage.
from David Leitch- sold. Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Hobbs & Shaw, John Wick, and it's sequels all kick ass. and Ilya Naishuller- you had my curiosity, now you have my fullest attention. Hardcore Henry kicks ass.
Looks awesome
Let's not forget Saul DID mention a second wife. Maybe he wasn't fucking around.
Saul Wick John Goodman  Jimmy McWick John McGill
Saul wtf you are doing ?
What is even HAPPENING?!?!? I’ll fucking TAKE IT.
OH MY GOD IS THAT SAUL
This look great.... but it lost me at the end with the 'in theaters only' nonsense.
You don't call 911 Who do we call then? You better call Saul...
S-s-s-aul?
Holycrapeola, that looks great. Probably another sleeper hit like john wick, because ya know, it looks like a real hollywood movie that is sorely missing from our culture, so when these come along people clamor for them.  Ill go to the theater for this, would rather see it more then dune. That is saying alot because denis is my all time favorite film maker next to young ridley scott and young james cameron. But John wick came out right before movies went to h.3II.  Now we are in a time, where the majority are trsh because of casting and ! de ti nty politics, while this looks awesome for its simple, plea sur @ble story of kicking b{_]t and taking names.  Reminds me of bruce willis's DH from the 80s, brutal bad a/$$ and just good hollywood old school fun.  until they get their heads out of their a $$ es in the ticspoliti department, because as film goers, we dont care how they feel about this or that, This kind of stuff is worth more then marvel and star wars....
Bob started his career as a comedian, then become serious character artist, now he is a action hero. This kinda role suits him.
Does anybody know the name of the song?
Wow, apparently John Wick took a law degree.
Yeaaah i love Kevin Costner
Can’t wait for that Nobody and John Wick crossover
WTF..! The dog from JOHN WICK is alive and changed his name to KITTY CAT... give me a pencil god...
So its John Wick, but with Bob Odenkirk? I'm in.
In theaters only, by my county's theaters have been closed since April 2020 and are still closed :/
I love Bob and want to like this film, but I have a hard time buying him as an action hero after seeing him be the exact opposite for so very long.
When Keanu Reeves isn’t available you better call Saul
Ilya is truly a talented action director. Has a bright future in Hollywood. Won't be surprised if gets a big gig after this for an existing franchise.
This Better Call Saul movie looks insane.
'Nobody' seems to be the old age story of John Wick after his retirement..kick ass 👌👌
No Shaky camera, no fast cutting.  I think this will be a great action movie.
What was the music in the bus scene ??
Soundtrack name???
Better Call Nobody
Outstanding. Looks like Jimmy McGill is channeling his inner Walter White!
All i know is that this trailer aint hd.. at least not yet
Saul Goodman throwing some hands! Bob Odenkirk is the man.
Who's gonna watch this JUST because of Saul A.K.A Bob Odenkirk?
Better call Saul........🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✌️
Shit! i am in trouble now 😨
Now Saul got balls
Can bob odenkirk like stop....      Getting hotter and hotter. Like daymmm
I am SO HAPPY for Bob! Yay looks like a fun movie.
Does anyone know the song for the trailer?
Огонь!
OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Reminds me of when the Russian guy from John wick says that fuckin nobody is John wick
Imagine if John Wick had a cameo
2021 we get nobody 2022 we get john wick 4&5 win win hopefully
ohhh its  older john wick 🧓🏻   excited to see .
I love Bob Odenkirk but this is unbelievable cringe. I could see men like my dad being genuinely excited about this but that’s it. Unhappy middle aged men who feel a lack on control in their lives and take it out on others.   I’m the Boomer Joker baby!
saul plays ww?
Necesito el soundtrack de esto
Nobody: Knock, Knock Stranger: Who's there Nobody: Nobody
Don't fook with It's all good man ❤️🔥
Next John wick 4 : Revenge of nobody
Wexler McGill @ 28 seconds
Who ? The fucking nobody ?  That fucking nobody ..... Is Nobody !!!
Better Call Nobody
Bob Odenkirk has got into great
Taken + John Wick= Nobody
I can see the sequel: John Wick vs. Nobody
I'm not convinced Bob Odenkirk was the right choice for leading an action movie.
Death Wish, Saul style
Che Saul, ahora sí no te dejarás golpear por Mike
You'd think that Russians would've learned their lesson after the last "nobody" they messed with...
John wick with a sense of humor now this the movie for me
Better call John wick
Its like an Indian movie...
Солу надоело скрываться в мексиканской кафешке
2:37 it took me all day to do that in COD ....
Remember Lalo in Prison to Saul "I mean You're Nobody" Saul didn't forget about it.
Some breaking bad, john wick and equalizer
God I hope this is in the John Wick universe
Lalo isn’t gonna stand a chance 😳
Fuck Yes. Everyone must watch Better Call saul
OMG This is gonna be good! Bob brought everything to this role!
3 minuyte llong trailer? smh. Going to stop at 30 sec
please stop the stupid jokes about Better Call Saul
Извиняюсь, мне показалось, что в фильме снимаются Паль и Серебряков или нет?
Better Maul Saul.
The smoking scene is just speechless
This looks good
It started just a John Wick movie and then they doing a Cinematic Universe about it. Damn
This looks fun! Ha ha 🙂
John Wick In A Family Version 😂😎FIRE!
It's like Saul went to John Wick for a new start after Walter White died.
Паааааааааль
This trailer gave me goosebumps!!
Better not call Saul. Cause he'll fucking murder you!
What if this movie is connected to john wick? Easily hutch was a murderer like john wick
Nobody: Bob Odenkirk: "So here's how Better Call Saul ends."
One word :Wow
'NOBODY' does it better👍👍
If Saul Goodman broke bad....
Please be set in yhe John Wick universe. Future crossover
2:03 the gold, is that a John Wick ref?  is it set in the same universe as Wick?
Fuck.  Yes.
whats the name of the song in the trailer
Imagine if at the end of movie.!!! John wick: Bob... Bob: John...    : THANK YOU guys, I never had that So Much likes 😃🙏
Moral of the story - Never settle down?
I know the premise isn’t original, but this looks way too much like JW. Hopefully, there’s more to the plot
He’s John Wick’s lawyer
Илюша Найшуллер молодец) Протаскивает наших актеров в Голливуд) Серебряков и Паль хороший выбор для этих персонажей
What is the name of the song which play in background
Is this in the same universe as John Wick? 🤔
good luck with in theaters only
I wish it's release in Hindi #Universalpicture
I need to see this in a THEATER.
This looks AMAZING!!
John Wick fotocopy
2:26 - "break it you bought it" - tony stark (iron man 3)
Ок!! Россия
Heard there will be a John Wick cameo on this film
Nobody: Better Not Call Saul.
Better Call Nobody
Hell yeah ... I want this
This looks better than 99% of the movies released so far this year
The best part... the John Wick crossover in a few years.
THIS is the moment Jimmy became Saul Goodman
good
This is fucking Brilliant !!!!❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Gene quits being a manager in Cinnabon.
Can't wait for more this movie. Awesome 👍
"Why couldn't you put the kitty cat bracelet back in the box?"
When he said I am gonna fuck you up!! I saw John Wick in him saying, " People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer, but yeah, I'm thinking I'm back"
Investigater : who the f ck are you? Bob: Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you
Please in hindi
0:41 Mike and Saul
Who the fuck are you.??   i am nobody...  Jhon wick - no it's me after marriage and two kids..
I never knew Saul Goodman was this badass.
Universal Pictures baby!!! #TeamUniversal
I am just gonna pretend I am watching Saul Goodman
Excuse my language, but holy ******* ****!
1:04 Bob Odenkirk is so strong the when he punches air, it still hits
Saul the Action Hero
In Hong Kong, everyone is a secretly a martial arts master In India, everyone is a secretly a singer and dancer and in the US, everyone is secretly a highly trained ex assassin.
Keanu would've been perfect for this but he is already John Wick.
Лёха Серебряков, мать его...!
thought this was fallout
'A history of violence' vibes!
Doesn't work, all I can see and hear is Saul.
Who immediately sang "My god I'm so lonely, so I open the window, to hear sounds of people..."
കിടുവേ ......
I can see that coming Assassins universe!
Isn't that the guy who directed harcore henry?...
I WANT TO SEE THIS SOOOO BADDD!!!!!!!
Better Call Saul Afterlife
😍😍😍
oknow lets respect everybody to not kill by the nobody
:O
Jimmy had enough of Cinnabon
I like how the marketing parodying John Wick, while being made by much of that creative team.
umm... dadwick?
0:28 So after BCS , Saul kept a little reminder
Bob Odenkirk is a gifted actor. Underrated.
Holy crap , Saul is throwing down
Name of the song?
So that’s what working at a Cinnabon makes of you
In theaters only.... until they stream it on the same day
1:31 Kim
This looks absolutely FIRE🔥
Awesome trailer
Bobby Odenkirk
Bob Odenkirk is one of my favorite actors plus they filmed this in my city outside my dorm building so at night I could watch what was going on I'm so excited for this movie
Give me that God damn kitty cat bracelet
El amigo del cartel
Poor Jimmy, the lack of stickers to grant him free parking drove him insane
John Wicks legit cousin lmao
Woooooow  joylavita.com
It's like a mix of Taken and John Wick
I love this ❤️👍
jhon wick the retirement years
Bob Odenkirk? John Wick director? COUNT ME IN!  "In theatres only"  THE FUCK DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON OUT THERE?  Waiting for VOD release.
Keanu x Bob
Good trailer! Send the movie...
Don't call 911  Better call Saul
John Wick Max Pro
This feels like what would have happened if John Wick had family.
This is basically the same plot as John Wick... made by a John Wick producer.
Nobody :  It’s all Good , man .
0:40 Mike?
“In theaters only”     Ace Venture: *” REEEHEHEAAALLLYYYYY???”*
"Don't call 911"  better call Saul then
I Hope Mike sees this one!
Best Daddy ever
„In theatres“ haha yeah good joke
This movie is 2020 punching us from every possible corner
So in short john wick with kids
Idk, this looks kinda..... 'Familiar'.
So basically John Wick Part 1 but John Wick is a Dad.
Jimmy Wick
That's my Bob
Anyone know background song name ?
This so looks to be set in a John Wick universe. And that's superb!
That's John wick who started a family
Better call saul for any trouble 😂 now saul is tuff as fuck 💪💪💪
Wish it came out digitally and not a theater
Wow looks awesome can't wait looks like brother of john wick is in town
best movie trailer ive seen in years
So here is another jhon wick huh!! "Give me god damn kitty cat bracelet"
its not all good man
This dude killing it! He just knows he's a badass.
So, Bob's chosen the Bruce Willis route. Not bad.
this is so dope 🔥
Saul goodman 😍
Please dubbed this in hindi and movie also
I know a guy who know a guy who knows another guy who knows nobody🤣🤣🤣🤣
Liam neeson vs John wick vs equalizer vs nobody
Does anybody know what the song is?
looks pretty good
Seems like it can be a Instant classic or a complete failure.  Either way I hope it's entertaining for the better or worse.
О, Паль и Серебряков
haha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLuZGlwStBM
Так, ну и где русские комментарии?
It's so weird seeing this goofy ass lawyer as a baddas one man army
Saul Goodman epilogue, he is a fucking bad ass
Someone call the Ghostbusters, because when he's done they're gonna be putting in alot of overtime.
GOD DAMNIT!!!
I'm screaming while watching this! Can't wait!
Looks pretty good.. must watchable in 2021
Damn, an SNL skit are actually funny for once.
0.46 ~1.17 daniel bernhardt. I'm in
2:41 Wow!
Ridiculous. I'm in.
So this is where Jimmy went after the end of Breaking Bad ;) jk looks fantastic! I love Bob Odenkirk!
Wow what a trailer i am so excited to watch this movie.
Why not for india....
What am I even suppose to feel
А Найшулер тащит своих. Когда увидел Паля чуть со стула не упал))
This new reboot of Mr. Show is... interesting
Man, this really looks like it could exist in the same universe as John Wick!
Holy shit the director of Hardcore Henry is directing this. Damn. This gonna get brutal
It's a damn cool trailer...
Kitty cat bracelet 😂
John Wick: Who are you?  Jimmy McGill: You, and a part-time lawyer too
I will watch this one coz of kitty cat bracelet
Bob Odenkirk is the new Liam Neeson.
Is Nobody working for The Continental Or Is he the man who kills people with Paint Brushes?
Good to see Kevin Costner do more action roles.
Это Мейзи
Anybody: got ny prblm Saul: I know a guy who knows a guy!  The Guy: Call Nobody 😂🤦‍♂️😂🤦‍♂️😂
Slippin Jimmy: The Movie
He Would be a perfect role for "Rorshach" Character in watchman movie 🔥🔥
He looks like Rick Grimes from season 5 here
So better call Saul's new John wick?
"Yes I have to say is Nobody"
So...toxic masculinity the movie?
Hardcore Henry director...  My idol...   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Better not call Saul
John Wick: Who are you?  Jimmy McGill: You, and a part-time lawyer too
Never steal someone else's daughters god*mn kitty cat bracelet
Where can i find the song?
*John Wick* : _kills everyone for a dog_  *Saul Goodman* : _kills everyone for kitty cat bracelet_
holy! this is soo gonna be basic good! i miss keannu reeves!
Basically this movie is John Wick with family, Trailer looks awesome
I kinda feel strong "Happy" vibes
It's all good man
Невероятно! Очень круто! Очень жду!
Bob Odenkirk as John Wick. Not kidding, this is why i live
How much do you think they paid the VO guy to come in for 20 seconds and say "In Theatres February 26"?
0:52 Best part of trailer 😳😳😳😲😲😲
Dear producers; If you wanna say that "we dont give a fuck about story, we have got great action and fun" it's okay. But if you gave one tiny bit of effort for the plot, this trailer has fucked that up.
They took her little women...
this must be john wick & liam neeson's cousin. they call him "nobody"
That Fucking Nobody is Saul Goodman.
Plz somebody tell me name of the song in trailer
Better Call NOBODY
How
Saul has had enough
Better call nobody.😎
I kind of liked the idea more that he was just a Dad pissed off about being a pussy instead of the usual "retired hitman" angle.
Better Call... NOBODY?!?
This is directed by the director of Hardcore Henry. If you love great action films I highly recomend you that film
Sooo hyped for this! Naishuller (the director of “Hardcore Henry”) did great job for sure 🔥🔥🔥
Saul Badman
Wonder if Davis & Main will represent him 🤔
Toyota Yaris https://youtu.be/CwJCSmts8M8
Toyota Yaris https://youtu.be/CwJCSmts8M8
His action felt real. He is not nobody.
Saul Goodman on Earth 2.
Jimmy : It's all good man. Nobody : nothing's all good
What ever  happening.... don't call 911
Haha can't wait! Jimmy McGill meets John wick !!!
Better call Nobody.
i think we should  Better Call Saul before watching the movie
John wick from another universe 👌
This is if John Wick had a family
Not gonna lie. Super excited for this but man.. it feels like it wouldn't take much to have this connect with the John Wick films.
budget wick
That was a sick Triple Collat at 2:37
Hot damn!
Dont show me all the good parts!!
BADASS❤️
What is the name of bgm,  please tell
KICKASS😍😍😍
The movie makers and big companies and I mean everyone like Disney, 21st century fox, literally everyone should all put aside there differences and make one epic movie it should have comedy, drama, romance ,mystery, violence, and sadness. and then at the end its just a big olé fight like this bad guys versus good guys, just throw everyone one at everyone. it should be our gift as humans that have been stuck in this dam pandemic. If this film were to happen it would go down in movie making history and be a symbol that as a human race we are still capable of working together and making something fun and great. And if those movie makers see this message which you probably never will, think about how amazing and profitable this film would be. This film would be a film that everyone on earth would see at least once if not twice, and the profits would be monumental so you can split the money evenly between all the companies that helped make this, or donate it all to a charity or idk freaking end poverty or something. My main point is that something like this has never been done, and unless some big company gets the idea out there it never will.
We all know that this guy is not fit for an action movie. I think he’s a very good actor that deserves a high quality screenplay. Not this alpha male stuff there.
Now i know how saul godmann got so many contacts😂
"Better Call Saul!"                        -Nobody
So another John wick?
Only in theaters....  Yeah, right.
A versão remixada de "Just a Gigolo (Ain't Got Nobody)", do Louis Prima, foi a cereja do bolo! Muito bom!
Oh, this is such a wonderful surprise. Nothing against KR (the man is a national treasure we don't deserve him all hail his grace KR forever) but BO can, y'know,... act. Really well. And is dark AF. And I'm totally going to watch yet another hyper-violence revenge flick because BO is JW the world needs.
Instantly my new favorite movie!
jimmy!!!
GIVE ME THE GOT DAYUM KITTY CAT NOW❗️❗️❗️😡😡😡😡😡
1:00 It's All Good, Man. 1:14 Didn't this guy have enough when Harley Quinn broke his legs?
This is the moment where Jimmy became Heisenberg
Some amazing shots in this.
Looks so badass 😲😲😲😲
The background music theme was somewhat close to F9
2:37 OH BABY A TRIPPLE
They literally showed the whole goddamn movie in the trailer
I like an idea. But it`s Taken/The Equalizer all over again - I mean an old unfit actor successfully fights young strong bad guys with a power of a good editing and an actually trained stuntman.
Anyone know the name of the trailer song
Хорош Илюха
It is awsm
"A History of Violence" with a more "John Wick" feel. I kind of wish the trailer hadn't revealed the John Wick bits, but it's unsurprising.
nobody :- i am nobody   john wick :- hamm yeah thats my cousin
@2:37 my man hits a triple collat lol
It seems like everybody wants to be John Wick all of a sudden
Give me the damn kitty cat bracelet 🤣🤣🤣🤣
nobody..  absolutely nobody..  Hutch - "GIVE ME THE KITTY CAT BRACELET!!!!"
looks very good man
This is what Blue Meth does to a lawyer
theaters only? WHY :(? will have to wait till june or july for it come on TV.
When saul is called for extermination....
finally bob odenkirk is having a debut. he is one of the finest actors
This looks fucking amazing.
man I always thought Bob Odenkirk could really sell a gritty action movie and here he is!
Mr Nobody, closest neighbor of Mr John Wick. What a neighborhood... 😉 😂 😂
John Wick: You killed my dog!? Hutch: Give me the kitty cat bracelet!
pov: slippin jimmy didnt stop slippin
Please let this be in the same universe as John wick....
Is this john wick universe? are they expanding? expanding would be cool
2:26 "Put the bunny back in the box."
01:32, STRONG John Wick vibes
Finally hollywood coming out with something that can excite me.......even though it's the breaking bad spin off we never asked for but clearly need rn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
So...John Wick then?
This is what happens when you hang out with Walt too much
Something great to look foward to in 2021!👍🔥🔥
Home Alone adult version

Looks fun, banter and hard in same time! Like it
“Give me the god damn kitty cat bracelet”  Yup   2021 tag line!
is not just a cat bracelet
“Better Call John Wick”?
The trailer would have been better if they used Nate Dogg and Warren G's - Nobody does it better
Better NOT call Saul!
Can't wait 🤠
John Wick : vengeance for his dog  Saul Wick : becomes vicious for the kitty cat bracelet
Hmmm the thumbnail resembles the John wick poster I ain't mad. Love it

When  John Wick can't ... this guy seems to be the next best bet.
Would be interesting if this is set in the same universe as John Wick.   Secretly setting up a John Wick avenger team
