2:54 Valbuena blackmail?
4:33 Oh no it's Newcastle all over again!
Wow imagine if I shoot a ball simultaneously with my rival, hopefully I'll be in the same situation as Ronaldo and Mbappe and Haaland would simultaneously shoot balls at me and would be back in my universe.😩😖😍🤓
😂😂😂😂
We been waiting long enough Now release the next episode its done, mbappe is now a madrista.
"All I ever wanted was to score a humanly impossible amount of goals. But what they don't tell you about football when you're starting off your professional career at age five. Is that there would be so much drama."   –{ Erling Haaland }–
Erhhh not Mbappe telling Benzema”why don’t u be like the France squad and stay out of it”😭😭😭 Crazy🤣
Nice
Nuce
Messi calling it soccer makes me so happy
So stupid
The French "Hoo Hoo" to Mbappe 😂
I like Bellingham ❤
Anyone else realise that Haaland was doing the 'Ben Godfrey mick-taking' face when he got shot
the box office will be the new  season
Harry Kane 💀
PSG likes to show as giant, but against the real giants become like a child.
frank lampard😂
Ttddfg
The true face of Kylian :  2:10  vive la vida loca en el PSG!
Messi just accepting that he has nothing left to win is golden.  Bro litteraly earned 100% on his save file🦾
This is the funniest episode 😅
Ok, Mbappe is getting to be the most interesting character in the whole show.
3:49 i came here fast as i can after the game
3:51 they just beat Liverpool lol
This series is f in great. Thanks for the laughs.
Bruh Saka’s introduction is hilarious bc it’s so true😂😂😂
Waiting for the champions, Florida Edition.
Mbappe saying "you know u coulld always join me in league one, perhaps a loan to Leon" got me real good
Where did Mbappe get the small chair
Valbuena blackmail 💀☠
I can't with mbappes voice 😂
They are making mbappe evil😂😂😂

Time to work buddy it’s Florida edition time😂
I was over here like when did Mbappe have a bugguete
Haaland would beat the crap out of Mbappe
Champion of Football , Not Just Champion of Europe - CR7
The Neymar-Mbappe arc happening in real life....DAMN!!!
and this is true 😂😂 Mbappe just made psg getting rid of Neymar and fly him to saudi
"Pep says I cant wonder😔"
No one talking about, and Mbappé Erling Haaland, having an entire war in the mansion
Im gonna enjoy this season XD
3:56 "Do goals even count if you score for those clubs?" Damn😂😂😂🤣🤣
You never lose in Toulouse 😂😂😂.
The funny thing is that is not even these two the next goat rivalry. As football fan its simple to get it.
The Florida season is the best!!!😂😂
Everyone that has watch them for a long time raise your hand
Is there really gonna be a Florida edition?
Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder 😂
Messi just WC and chill no care in the world 😂 I ❤ him in the real and the champions world. GOAT
"Pep said I'm not allowed to wonder"
You release slower now 😭😭😭
Nah messi turned American too fast  He calls football soccer now 5:08
"Ahh it's like Newcastle  all over  again" 😂😂
mane punching scene 😂😂😂
No way man was whistling to the Erica theme
5:02 Aaronson?
4:27 is the best part 😂
This is absolutely BRILLIANT!!😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tonali is very young too!
Pas besoin de comprendre l’anglais pour comprendre 😅
Messi still the best player even at 36
Hold up! How da heck did Kane get into the mansion???!💀
Since when did Mbappe get a little ga- I mean, ... uhhhhhh
Hahahahaha! I rarely laughed that much, this episode is hilarious! Countless easter eggs as usual, of course, but everything about Ligue 1 (the French championship) was delicious! I don't know why, although I'm for Marseille, the loan to Lyon thing basically cracked me! This cartoon is brilliant!
Best thing on YT
We need to see more Vini Jr., he's top 3 itw rn.
Erling haaland vs kylian mbappe
It's new castle all over again😂😂😂
I like when mbappe said: you know, you could always join me in Logue 1 perhaps a loan to lyon 😂😂 he's more than a rapper 😂😂😂
"Now I'll let my soccer do the talking" messi dont gaf😂😂😂
"Some boujee crib" i felt that line😂😂😂
Awesome episode.
Agree with Mbappe tho Messi's gone soft 🥲
plz add rushford
sadiomane doh
Haaland and Mbappe though
Messi just not giving a fuck is just godly
Jack Grealish doing Haaland's hair 😂😂😂
Love the earley introt better 👍  the new one 👎
Yeah Haaland, in ligue 1 you got Nantes Tolouse
“I’m gonna stick to tap-ins” 😂😂😂 im dead
Can't wait for the Champions Florida Edition!
When you say world superstars reboot you meant the show bc they are in Saudi Arabia and not the mansion 😢
It was incredible to hear the name of my favorite team: LILLE. Ligue 1 is underrated!
That Messi's i dont give a fk line 😀😀
Messi's reaction was hilarious. "I don't care"
"oh nooo, it's Newcastle all over again"😂😂😂
You'll never lose in Tolouse 🤣🤣🤣
the chair mbappe stood on ☠️😭
I LOVE GAVI AND PEDRI 😂
Newcastle's joke was really hilarious😂😂
This intro music is AWESOME Absolutely love it❤
This is just too good 😂
Haaland " pep says im not allowed to wonder"😂😂😂😂
Messi don't give a fuck
Ur just a goal scorer! It's sadly true he'll never win a world cup.
I cracked up when i seen benzema holding blackmail tape, lol what
Call me slow but I just got the whole football puppet thing!
O Mbappe parece vilão mesmo, kkkkk. Mas a fita do Bezema foi muito boa. Reboot time!!!!
Messi the mastermind does not care
crazy 😂
No not enjoying next gen
Where is the next episode 😊
Where is the next episode 😊
Messi tooo savage 😂😂
What’s penzema doing with real shirt? He’s already in saudi😂
Br football please update Sergio Ramos, He's now in Flamengo from Brazil like Luiz Suares. And no flamengo ain't no small team, they were third place in the  world club ranking in 2022, behind Real Madrid and CIty if i'm not wrong
Mbappe's "you never loose in Toulouse" got me 😂
I was like Mbappe I know you want a rivalry between you and Haaland but did you really have to get that close to his face?
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder" LOOOOL
JajJaja me ha encantado el retiro de todos los viejos, el video de valbuena, el puñete de sane a mane jajajaja...Mbappe va a tener que ir a la premier para competir con Haaland....
Mbabbe makes the perfect villain. He is a lot smarter than the others.
4:29 I'd love to see el wey here
Se eu pudesse curtia duas vezes!
Erlíng is a robot
Evil, skimming Mbappe is a Vibe😂😂.
Am low key happy for 🐐Leo
Vini >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Meddi chilling while the other's lonely in Saudi..gets me hard😂😂
Very nice but short😭😭😭
Where is Vini and Rodrygo? 👀
😂deserved my support bro honestly
Mbappé is nice 😡😡😡
Where's Osimhen
Kane saying "oh no it's Newcastle all over again" killed me😭😭😭 In case you didn't know spurs were losing 5-0 to Newcastle in the first 21 minutes of the game and as an arsenal fan, that's premium comedy 😂😂👌
Todas as referências em segundo plano durante a troca de tiro de bola são perfeitas hahah
are first 30 seconds a refference to Silo serie?
I feel old 🥲
Add speed meeting Ronaldo in the show
Goal scorer!!!
The worst thing that happened to Cris` career was being compared to Messi.    And ironically, the best thing of his career was being compared to Messi...
Bro wants to be rivals in the goat comp
"uhh ima stick to tap ins"
A moment of Silence for my fellow LFC fans, its the Europa House for us
I love pep
Can't help but notice that Osimhen 🇳🇬 has not been referenced. Great Mbappe depiction 😁
I don't want any trouble imma just stick to tap ins😂
VALBUENA BLACKMAIL got me LMAO
Mudryk🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eerika
Would love too see Kate Abdo roast Micah Richards sometime this season at the end if they do  a reunion like season 1 episode 9
YESS FINALLY AN ARSENAL PLAYER MAKES HIS DEBUT ON THE CHAMPIONS
Lmao😂 “ the valbuena tape”
Mbappe learned a little too much from his ex

Please add manor solomon
EPIC!!
The amount of Chelsea rooting in this episode was perfect. This is coming from a Chelsea fan
oh ohhh
Saka 😂😂😂
I like the way Benzema insults curse
Sane🥊Mane 😂😂
You never lose in Toulouse 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wrong tape 😭😭😭
Haaland shouldn't worry too much. CR7 never won a world cup and people still argue he's the GOAT for some strange unknown reason.
Can we all appreciate how far this series has gone to the level of having a next generation❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Pep doesnt allow me to wonder" had me dead
Mbappe's flow of lyon to Toulouse and lile in the ligue to haland was just hard epic 2.o👌🔥
"My sweet Nordic 9" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm a Marseille supporter if Erling wants to come in, that will be a good dream 😂😂  but we don't have the money
Funny how mbappe was telling Erling to join Marseille
Where’s Nunez
No player from UCL runner up team 👎🏽
You never lose in toulouse is cute
Pep said not to wounder 😂
Why. Do. Haaland sound. Like. Kermit
When did the GOAT acronym start to get thrown around so casually? Haaland and Mbappe already using it when they have such a long ways to go is puzzling 🙄
First of all, shout out to the creators of this show 😊
Wheres messi’s talking ball?
I don't get the unicorn part with Phil
Benzema valbuena blackmail tape😂
The valbuena black tape 💀💀
Frank Lampard tripped
😂😂😂okay this keeps getting better and better
Were is martinelli
4:41 THE FACE 😂😭
Did somebody forgot Harry kane saying “Oh no its the new castle all over again”
You dont know how good it feels to see aresenal back in the champions house
"Do goals even count if you score for those clubs?" Had me on the floor
"I may look adorable on the outside, but on the inside I'm humble and modest" 😂😂
we must get them to three million subscribers
Spurs Trophy Cabinet at the back of Harry Kane🤣🤣
Petition to have El Wey the Goat in one episode
why is chelsea in this
oh jesus they are getting sued this time
Soccer is becoming a black sport 😂
Haaland and Mbappe seem kinda gay ngl.
This is already legendary. Mbappé and Haaland's rivalry is gonna be on next level fr
This is GOLD 🤣
No vini jr? He won a champions league, mpabbe did not hehehehhe
Bro the valbuena blackmail 💀💀💀💀
😂Haaland saying' pep says I'm not allowed to wonder' is truly funny
Bro they did benzema dirt  With the blackmail tape
Mbappe whistling the french national anthem while looking for Haaland😭
That Valbuena tape I CAN'T 🤣🤣
“You never lose in Toulouse” 😹😹😹😹 3:49
Pep said im not allowed to wonder
In a soccer game, a player and opponent goalkeeper are going for the ball. The goalkeeper tries to kick the ball, but the player gets the ball first and then accidentally steps on the keeper's foot which the keeper had used to kick the ball and then scores a goal. Is it a goal or a foul?
Now there has to be a Saudi edition!
"do goals even count if you score for those clubs" Sounds like erling😂
I love the new intro
This is just too peak 😂
" Valbuena Blackmail" 😂😂😂
Background music ?
New Entrance  Boooooo
This was glorious. Thanks I needed this😊
The animation that went into Haaland’s hair is such a nice touch
Anyone notice how in the intro Pedri has the number 10 on his shorts
hahaha does this mean we are getting champion concacafe edition just for messi?
Let the rivalry begin! To arms!
Who's the script writer??? 😂  Wow!  I would love to see the Rebecca Vardy Easter egg
Who would have thought Arsenal would ever make an episode? 😂
Ronaldo is the goat
Oh that was a great ending 😂😂😂
Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder  lol
That pig head below Figo’s statue lmao! 😂
mbappe AND HAALAND RIVARLY
Messi will play Soccer that's why new edition .... Woah  G.O.A.T. move 🤘
Best episode so far
The way messi doesn’t give a fuck after winning every single trophy is the best thing ever
Do you also got a conference league house
They need to make a series
Newcastle again 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can’t believe how many people are dickriding Messi just cause FIFA handed him the World Cup 🤣🤣🤣  Like how was it a penalty against Szczesny when he barely touched Messi face? And there was no way Messi was getting to that ball. How was Paredes not given a red card after that slide tackle on Ake then follow up blasting the ball at Netherland substitution bench? And a penalty for Argentina in the final against France after Di Maria trip himself by barely gracing Dembele…  2022 World Cup was definitely more rigged than the 2010 World Cup for sure lol
Benzema with the wrong tape😂
Mbappé needs Haaland, but Haaland doesnt need Mbappé
Why’s saka a brummie loool
Add ishowspeed
Messi had Ronaldos voice  2:00
We need the champion’s Saudi Arabia edition as well
Bro where is Naples player? You racist
The rhyming of those Ligue 1 clubs😂😂😂finished me
Absolutely brilliant
"do goals even count if you score for those clubs?"😂😂😂
How is jude so short in this one 😂
Ligue 1 and Toulouse line 😂😂😂😂  Had to play it back
"Pep says am not allowed to wonder"
Villain Ark
Bro haaland and benzema are wearing   The 9 Shirt/Kit
"Pep said im not allowed to wonder" LMFAO, stay in the box Erling
Garden of Treason🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's a Cali accent, not Floridian.
Where is Oshimen????
That empty spurs trophy cabinet tho!😂😂😂
Flordia……CREW PLAYS MIAMI WE ARE GONNA SEE CUCHO AND ZELA ANIMATED OMG
I was literally wondering why Mbappe and Haaland were the same height.  When he fell off the stool I almost died 🤣😅🤣
Now I do my soccer do the talking 😢😢
Actually you are trying to create a new era rivalry
"You could always join me in *Ligue Un* perhaps a loan to Lyon." "You'd never *lose* in Toulouse." "How do you *feel* about Lille?" "A nice *payday* in Marseille" All that rhyming PLUS comedy! I love it!
The amount of small references in each second is beyond me. So well done and so creative 🌟
Mané and sane 😂😂😂
You guys really out did yourselves this time! Incredible Episode!  Possibly the best Episode ever?!?
Oh man the quality of these videos sure have gone down :((
Now I let my soccer do all the talking 😂😂😂
"My SwEeT nOrDiC nInE"
i miss the old champions
2:13 so fruity 😳
1:14 Tee hee 🤭
5:08 did messi say soccer😱
Spurs trophy cabinet (or lack there of) catching literal strays.
This has to be the best The Champions season so far!  Not that the others weren't great, but this shit has just been on another level!
Nobody will go to messi and ronaldo level
This is ingenious every time
“Yunno, you can always join in me Ligue Une, perhaps a loan…to Lyon”  In that French accent had me rolling😂😂😂😂
"how about you treat it like the French National Team and stay out of it?!"  Ouch!
You know you could always join me in Ligue 1 perharps a loan to Lyon. You'll never lose in Toulouse *insert French accent*😂😂 top tier word play
Would be weird if Haaland really acted like this in real life😂😂😂
Why does Haaland sound like Kermit?
😂😂 what is Chelsea doing in Champions next gen..... Really  We want more of havertz in Arsenal and Mikel too.....
I can't wait for the next ep , this season is getting more and more fun than the last ones 😍
Lol @ Spurs [empty] Trophy Cabinet
"Pep said Im not allowed to wonder/wander" got me
Harry Kane part about Newcastle was epic
Messi just in his own world with the World Cup
So funny
Spurs and their trophy cabinet 😂😂😂. Haaland to stick to Tap-ins 😂😂 Surplus chelsea players for sale, buy 2, get one free 🤧😂
"You know, you could always join me in ligue un, perhaps a loan to lyon."😂 I love that line. "You never lose in Toulouse."  "It's Newcastle all over again."
Essa série está incrível! ⚽🍷🗿
Whistling Le Marseille
Next episodes in Arda Güler please Guy is real madrid player
Shoulda had garnacho in with the kids. Mudryk isnt even in the ucl
This series never fails to impress 😂
Y’all didn’t just casually sink my city into the sea…😂😂
4:42 reminds me of Haaland  (442oons) and his,,mer,mer,mer“ gag
Erling doesn’t have a high pitch voice as in this video, his voice is very low. Also his English is way less fluent than in this video.
I'm just gonna stick to tapins 😢😂
Now I let my soccer do the talking... 🤣
i wonder if there are any players eagerly waiting for each episode just like us🤣🤣
Pep said he's not allowed to wonder 😂
Haaland don’t score tap ins
🙆🏿‍♂️😂😂😂
"Spurs trophy cabinet" 😂😂 don't do that. that is too much roasting
When are you going to update Haaland with his Rapunzel/Archilles hairstyle
Make more epis in bulk
"you never lose in Toulouse" 🤣🤣🤣
Pep said I'm not allowed to wonder 😅😅
Messi ronaldo story turned out for cristiano ???🤬

love it bruh
It’s… Rebekah Vardy deserves a monument
I’m going to stick with tapins 😭
Amazing frank
Reference i noticed 0:46 Saka is top 10 most most fouled player,i guess 0:53 I guess Leao have to play better 0:59 He played like sh!t 1:07 Xavi signed Gundogan and may sign another midfielder,so Pedri and Gavi pretented to be Xavi saying he no need a new midfielder 1:48 Messi leaves to Inter Miami after completing football and Mbappe was a huge fan of CR7 back in La liga 2:09 I think Pep want Haaland to be a superstar at such a young age instead of a wonder kid 2:22 PSG went to the UCL final of 2020 but lost,but Man City did in 2023,so Haaland think that their rivaly have not started yet 2:39 Haaland scored more than 50 goals in his first season at Man City 2:53 Benzema was guilty for blacklisting back in 2021 3:12 Because of 2:53,Benzema did not play for the french national team for over 5 years 3:15 Many people have called Haaland a tap in merchant in social media 3:37 We can see Aguero iconic last minute goal against QPR picture on the left 3:38 Haaland scored many hat tricks 3:44 Mbappe wants Haaland to join Ligue 1 for 1/2 to 2 years 3:49 Toulouse once lost 4 games in a row this season 4:10 Haaland and Norway failed to qualifty for the world cup 4:20 I think Haaland meant "That's sh!t slipped too far" 4:30 England used the unicorn for swimming back in 2021 4:31 Newcastle scored 5 goals against Spurs in just 21 minutes 4:38 The Chelsea players that are rumored or comfirmed to be sold 4:38 Sadio Mane punched Leroy Sane because Sane called Sadio a black sh!t 4:50 After Chelsea was in bad form and Potter got sacked,Lampard came in until the the season ends to fix the team.But go on to lose 8 games 4:56 Messi is not enjoying life in Inter Miami and let the puppet to talk for the rest of the time  These are all the references i noticed,some may not be true tho.
Super frankie lampard
This new season is just incredible
Fun fact: the whistle mbappe makes is the beginning of the france national anthem
@B/R football admin please add Ronnie Foden aswell I mean he is also a "Champion" 🙏🏾
3:42 Mbappe was rhyming in that part 🔥😂 , great season so far.
Why does mbappe sound like madara uchiha from naruto
Kane&NewCastle
You know, for being such prolific goalscorers, Haaland and Mbappè sure miss their targets a lot
As an Irish man seeing Declan Rice in the garden of treason is class 😂
Mbappe being fucking disney villain
3:32 got me like a war vibe for a second
the mbappe whistling is a german war or something right?
" 3:41 You know , you could always join me in Ligue 1  Perhaps a loan , to Lyon " 😂
"I don't want any trouble I will stick to tap ins"
Osimehn deserves to be here than mudryk
Why is osimehn not here
possibly the funniest episode of the series yet
Man this needs a netflix deal with longer episodes
U have to make the robot haaland stronger than that
When is episode4
Champions is not the same without CR7 and Messi
WRONG TAPE 😭😭😭
Cringe as hell
This season is awesome, loving it
When is champions Florida edition comming out
Every episode comes out ever week

The champions need el wey
Hey where is Rashford and Antony? Or at least Garnacho. You guys are not treating my side with respect
messi in this series.. i just love him.. he just dont give a fuck about anything the moment he adchive his dreams xD and everybody are mad cuz he doesnt care jajajajajaj
Messi unbothered has me dying lol
I think it's high time Victor Oshimhen join this series
I just remembered Liverpool is not part of the series anymore. GOD DAMN IT.
all-these-other-problems-in-Milan is called a failed national football association! And Americans.
Reality, just because of his appearance and his status of world class, Haaland is too humble to even make an enemy out of anyone in the footballing world. He doesn’t need a rival to make himself strong, he’s fine the way he is and he doesn’t need to have that sort of drama of beef, rivalry or any sort of scandal to make himself standout like Cristiano and Messi. The only reason there was a rivalry was because of fans and the media were making comparisons out of them both. In reality, Messi and Ronaldo are friendly to each other, never have been there an ounce of hate between them both and they respect each others morals.
The Champions, CONCACAF edition?
Gta vice city?🥂🍾🏖
what about the real goat vini jr?
Mbappe's voice😂😂😂😂😂😂
Okay wait. "But pep said I can not wonder"😂😂😂😂😂
Mbappe destroying spurs empty trophy case😅😂

Surplus Chelsea players for sale
Valbuena blackmail?😂😂😂😂
Friendly reminder that the Eredivisie passed the Ligue 1 this season and starts as the new 5th league in Europe
Who comes up with Bro this talent amazing
Step away from Norwegian goal machine Mbappe😂
I like the reboot, was getting bored of Messi vs CR since CR's unprofessional downfall and Messi ending debate with WC
4:27 Love the reference to Grealish eating Chinese food after games Edit: Also might be a bit of a reach but the opening scene might be an Adam and Eve reference since Haaland says “Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder”
Imagine in this next gen Messi wins another Balon d’or.😂😂😂 After being unbothered.
Can we get some manutd players ?
Mbappe using a stool to hug Haaland 😂
Pedri wearing number 10🤔
Historic series... best one and end of an generation... yet Lewa and Modric are still standing... just to show off
Mbappe "you don't loose in Toulouse" 😂😂
Vinicius?????
Haaland the frog???
YEAHH!!!
Harry Kane said "it's Newcastle all over again"😭😭😂😂💔💔💔
One of the only things i look forward to on YouTube🙌🏾
Haaland atm destroying shit farmer.
Just love the Champions and all the easter eggs in these episode like the reference of Figo betraying Barca and switch to Real Madrid,Messi not giving a fuck after winning the world cup,Mane punching Sane and many others! Kudos to the writers and animators because their work is better than EA Sports FC 2024
best episode they finally put saka in
Lampard😂😂
Harry Kane being shot with balls lol clearly reminds me of when Spurs lost away even Isak couldn't celebrate he was sh*t😂😂
That Benzema blackmail tape stole the beginning of the episode😂😂
Not the Valbuena Blackmail tape😂😂😂
Mbappe standing on a stool to talk to haaland had me 😹😹😹💀💀
I need the Florida edition!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mbappé is like the football version of a wrestling heel
Amazing animation
“You know, you can always join me in Ligue Un, perhaps a loan to Lyon.” The rhymes killed me. 😂😂
Best ep this season!
"am just gonna stick with tap in's"😁😁
The champions Next gen ; Where Gvardiol?
Mbappe my goat
Love all the subtle references! This series is great!
Mbappe like Ronaldo they all want to start a goat debate
PEP doesn't let me wonder....
Hallant hatrick store
Any one noticed the Darth Vader/Luke reference?
Why bro forgot about kvaratskhelia
“Players stop fussin and start bussin” am I the only one that had to rewind that just to see if that’s what the narrator said😂😂
When Kane was before the spurs trophy cabinet and it was empty
Sol Campbell should have a Monument right in the entrance of the Garden of Treason.
"It's Newcastle all over again "🤣🤣🤣
you guys really hate vinicius
We need vinicius there
Haaland "I'll just stay with tapping" got me rolling 🤣
3:32 That whistling sound familiar...
messi never say soccer 🤮...this is fake man
Why is Haaland  so zesty? 😂
Harland being a gentle giant is class 👌
Next episode include neymar making a pool illegally because he did that
Why is Declan Rice in the garden of treason?
the Champions fell off.
Y the hell is kane protecting spurs empty trophy cabinet 😂
Why did he have that casette in his pocket
Mbappe and Haaland segment bruh
Haaland is so innocent 🥺
Bro where is Napoli Whit Kvara and Osimhen
"look how the messi/ronaldo story turned out for cristiano"  Jesus Christ, that might actually be the biggest burn in the series.
All that Messi do is just Chilling 😎😎🍷
It's Newcastle all over again got me poor kane 😂
You know You could always join me in ligue un... Perhaps a loan to lyon... You never lose in Toulouse...  Mad rhyming 🤣🤣🤣
Bro why is mbappe always the vilains
¿Spanish, plzz!!!
"You will never lose in Toulouse"  So good 😅😅
4:41 bro 💀
Eagerly awaiting the easter eggs and in depth explanation video, i feel like some references flew past me😂
Who else gets excited when B/R Football uploads? Not just me right?
mbappe going all dark side trying to persuade erling to fight him is reminiscence of darth sidious/darth vader enticing luke skywalker to unleash his anger in ROTJ
The only problem with this series is that the episodes are way too short.
Pep says im not allowed to wonder😂
This program should be on TVs screens😂😂
Me :-  Casually watching and chilling. Read more……
How come there is no Federico Valverde in the "next Gen" opening????
So glad my friends referred me to this, it's the best football content in existence! ❤️💯
Im more excited for champions Florida edition
Why is the video so short, make it 20 min
The Lampard slip😂😂😂
Best season ever!! Que crack Lio sobrado, GOAT relax. Miami vice vibes
Valbuena tape 😂😂 2:55
Next time is MLS edition?
Lloris going into the plane actually had me dying for a solid 5 minutes 😂😂 This should be a good one  🥰
I’d watch the Champions: Florida Edition just for more Messi. That and I’m American.
For me I think Halland is the next ronaldo because they are both very tall and score impossible amount of goals The next Ibrahimiovic could be his son who is old enough to play senior football and has Zlatan's attitude  And the next messi is Julian Alvarez because the win alot of trophies they are both from Argentina and Alvarez can play as a right winger
"Valbuena blackmail" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What is Spurs doing at the champions house??
Lampard 😭
It's kinda sad to witness your childhood goat approaching their retirement, and lately we just reached a new level of that when they're both out of Europe. 😞
Im gonna stick to tap ins😂
Lmaoo Messi defo doesn't care anymore, undisputed goat
Where is Victor oshimen and karashika
People want friends Mbappe wants enemies.
2:10 Pep Says am not supposed to Wonder 😂 💀 Classic
I love the champions
Kylian Mbappé Just want to become better than Haaland,Ronaldo,Messi
Still finding ways to seek in Messi & Ronaldo..shows how irrelevant the shows gonna be without them.
Gavi debuted 😂❤
4:08 it got real "Norway will nevrr challenge for the World Cup"😅
Mbappe vs Halland... over hyped! innit?
Jack
Saka's line... "I may look sweet and adorable on the outside, but on the inside I'm humble and modest" 0:45 🤣🤣🤣 especially that background classical. Kane "Oh no, it's newcastle all over again"
Wtf Chelsea doing there
😂 Norwegian goal machine
wtherz just too much dram in these i cant miss em
Vini Jr and the Real plays golf???
Benz valbuena blackmail tape 😂😂😂
bro nice one although all the balls made me feel hypnotized
Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder😂😂😂
I can’t believe I was with mbappe‘s side.
Funny things is how even with a very well done cartoon(besides all the media BS that we see all day) "they" are trying to make us think that these 2 guys will reach even a quarter of Cristiano`s/Messi`s level.The romantic side in football is DEAD ; they`re all mercenaries selling themselves to the highest bidder. Just to get back to the series @B/R Football Team - GREAT if not the greatest.
Champions
This is hilarious
Who the genius came up with that line "Pep says Im not allowed to wonder." 🤣🤣🤣
3:22 - reference to DEATH from PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. (Nice!!!)
Shii so funny😂😂
Ofc they had to diss ronaldo. “U will never be a true goat. U will only be a goal scorer” but i still have faith in him. 🚾🏆🔜
hi
Mbappe rhyming took me out😂
It's the valbuena blackmail tape for me 😂😂😂
They gotta get speed in this bro
100
Pep said Im not supposed to wonder 😂😂😂😂
do goals even count if you score for those clubs 🤣🤣🤣
Why not Saudi Edition Soccer is so boring
Chelsea's surplus players 😂: Auba, Havertz, Ziyech, who are the other 2?
This episode was pure gold.
Was super Frankie really necessary 😂😂
The champions next gen and you didn’t include literally the best u23 in the champions league this year? Respect Kvaratskhelia
I love these❤😂
Why Mbappe sound like africa guy
Anyone know what they make these animations in?
No one likes the the next gen stick to the original
"Do Goals even count if you score for those clubs ?"😂😂
That evil mbappe voice is everything 😂
i really like this kind of series, keep going!
The amount of subliminals and Easter eggs in this is crazy😅
As long as Mbappé stays at PSG, he will never come even close to Haaland's stats. So I don't really understand the rivalry. Then the question remains if Mbappé, with his arrogance, can function in another team... without giving up when he doesn't get the ball one time. Haaland is a hero in the field, a teamplayer. Mbappé probably never will be.
I love this
What the heck with The Champions..?
Haaland: I'm gonna stick to tap-ins😂😂
Kane: Its like newcastle all over again 💀
Why the Champions have Chelsea and Spurs?🤣
Messi straightforwardly not giving a solitary screw about anything in the wake of winning the World Cup is the best thing up until this point this season
They should make this an actual TV series!!!!! It's too funny.
This season is very interesting to watch 😂🔥
Mbappes takeover is gonna be hilarious😂
Love it. Keep it going please.
Mane just can’t resist giving Leroy Sané a concussion
Messi in season 7 is a Mood.😂❤
Shouldn't the spurs players amd Chelsea have been evicted by now 😂😅
Pedri and Gavi standing one on the other while they are both probably as tall as Xavi 😭😭😭
Do goals even count if you score for those clubs 😭😂
"Do goals even count if you score for those clubs?"😂😂😂😂😂
Do goals even count if you score for those clubs ?? 😂😂 great season so far 🔥👌
I love how Messi doesn't care coz he won the World Cup
"how about you treat this like the France squad, and stay out of it" im deadddddd
Benzema blackmail tape sent me 😘😭🤣😂
Keep up the good work 🎉
This episode was just funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Oh no its newcastle all over again" this line had me dying
why are his episodes so short
This is gold...thank u so much!!
Hey pls keep making the Champions Its a great series and i hope you all a good time watching this sure make me feel good thx
Kylian to Benzema: why don't you treat this like the french national team and stay out of it😂😂😂
Basically cars 3 but There are no old players
Mbappe and Haaland just became me and my friend when we were small playing nerf at his house 😂😂😂
As a chelsea fan this was quite painful😅😂 still hilarious
Mbappe should join Liverpool
Mbappe whistling la Marseillaise, that was funny😅😅😅
Hearing Messi say "The forbidden word" Scares me.
It's just AMAZING
I love this show
saka in the champions palace 🥲
Mane after the champions league With Sane
Messi not giving a f "Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder" Valbuena Blackmail Haaland's Hattrick Ball Storage Room "It's not like you to go hiding" then out of nowwhere Haaland starts shooting (iykyk)  "That's a shirt sleeve to far" "It's Newcastle all over again" Mane punching Sane The Chelsea players Erling's everton face  I don't know how much they're paying their writing stuff but it's not enough.
The empty spurs trophy cabinet 😭😭
“I’ll just stick to tap-ins”😂😂😂😂😂. True 😂😂😂
Where is kvaratskelia?
Anyone know the outro song that plays on the "subscribe" screen?
The story line has improved drastically 🔥🔥
Love how Messi just does not care
if mbappe move last year..
haaland and mbappe vs messi and ronaldo in their prime be like
😅.. Now we can see a new Balon D'or winner next season !!
I wish they would do a reaction video of real players on this😂
4:39 ouch💔😂😂😂😂
The champions 2.0 :Next Gen
My dear Bukayo❤❤❤❤❤ #GOYG
This s**t is getting out of hand, but I must admit it's an entertaining episode. 😂
They genuinely did something extraordinary. Such countless interesting references. Credit to the scholars. Needed to make a respectable attempt to get it together working lmao
Where is Arda Güler?
you never lose in Toulouse 😂😂😂
saw this in my reccomended, looked like shit, saw it, and it is shit
Why mbappe whistling erika😭🤣
5:05 a legend has gone...
ay wheres trent aint he a young start?
“Oh no, it’s Newcastle all over again”😂😂
I love how Lampard slipped, awful manager
soccer win🤣
Best episode
“Pep told me I am not allowed to wonder” 😂
Thank you for a part three
I love everything in the episode, but they could have done better with Saka's voice
This is amazing!!! 😂😂😂
İ have a conspiracy rigth now villain is Kylian rigth and in 442oons the villain is Kylian too so this means there is a spy among br footbal or maybe the spy is dean himself who knows.
Pep says I am not allowed to wonder.......
4:32 It’s newcastle all over again had me. 6-1 shameful
Super Frank
Yeah....UCL will not ever be without the 7 and 10....fck them for getting old...I was thinking about another 10 years...fck them
Haaland and Mbappe's chaos even made Kane flashbacks to Spurs horrible loss against Newcastle, even that 'trophy cabinet' 😂
lmaooo Mbappes no GOAT as long as he still in PSG hes no Rival & nothing compared to Haaland. Haaland been in Bundesliga & now hes competing in Premier.
I couldn’t take now I let my soccer do the talking 😢
3:12 is crazy
2:20 Mbappe had to stand on a stool bcs he ain't Haaland's height HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
The champions Next gen 😢
I miss the old intro
funniest episode ever
Messi not caring is the best thing about this.
This series keeps getting funnier and funnier dawg
" I let my soccer do the talking 😅😅😅😂😂😂
You know u could always join me in ligue ohn, Perhaps with a loan deal to Leon 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂Kane getting Newcastle flashbacks 😂😂😂
This is the last season of the glory of Legendary Era  In next eps or Next season it will different, and we will get more less two goat in video
lets play fofbal worl caaaa worl caaa worl caaa worl ca worl caaaaa les plai fofbal
Why the hell is Mudryk in this?  And Chelsea?
If this was the only content on this channel, I would immediately be a paid subscriber.
"you could always join me in leauge 1 perhaps a loan to lyon" and "you never lose in Toulouse" had my dyinggg 🤣🤣🤣
3:31 WHAT IS MBAPPE SINGING BRO DANG
When haaland and mbappe where shooting balls and harry kane said “oh no its newcastle again” gots me every time 😂😂
The idea of the content is good, but do you need a better writer🤷🏻‍♂️
All I ever wanted was to score a humanly impossible amount of goals. But what they don't tell you about football when you're starting your professional career at age 5. Is that there would be so much drama                           -Haaland 2023
It's weird seeing haaland being scared considering the machine he is and the way he bodies defenders
4:32  Spurs have a trophy cabinet?
Now I let my soccer do the talking crack me up💀💀💀
Haaland with his Pep😅
“ Ah Sh*t Wrong One!” Got me So good!
"Look at how the Messi/Ronaldo story turned out for Cristiano" 🤣🤣. This season is packed with goldmine for sure. All here for it!
This season is looking amazing 🔥🔥
Magnifique. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
We Want Champions - Saudi Edition
Spurs trophy cabinet was the perfect touch
Just noticed Kylian was standing on a stool when he was getting up close on Erling... 😂😂😂💀💀💀
Messi not giving a shit about anything is amazing
“Pep says I am not allowed to wonder”🗿💀
This season is so far the best season of  the champions
Mbappe pretending to be the Saudis to steal players was pretty damn good, now if only we can see who is pulling all the players to Miami and why.
Mbappe do be vibbin ERICKA😂😂😂. 3:30
Messi low key is the funniest character in Champions
I never watch any episode of The Champions without at least chuckling once or twice. Quality content! 😂😂
I just can't get enough of your videos. Every image and every move refers to a funny moment in football.😂😂😂
Man the frank bit was unneccesary :( ahahahahhahaha
the empty spurs trophy cabinet aaaaa
The florida edition 😂😂😂😂😂😂
A bit of dark episode, while the Halaand's voice makes him a walking comic relief 😂😂 it's all perfect
I checked this morning and got so sad when ep 3 wasn’t out 😂
It's sad it's only every week
Poor Sane ... ... and Kane 😂😂😂
When they showed Mudryk, I thought they were gonna mention how he was grilled by Joey Swoll. Also "Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder" 😂
If Mbappe ends up signing up for a Premier League club, then the Ronaldo Messi comparisons can really start kicking in
Bro The Mbappe line in the Halland Hat Trick Storage Room Was Goald
I know this season will be awesome
For me, if Mbappe stay in PSG and never won Champion League, There is no Haaland and Mbappe.
Ponen al Chelsea y no a Enzo noooo
where the f...k is Julian Alvarez!!!!!!!!  😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
men, not seeing ronaldo and messi in the same house is hard.
“Now I let my Soccer do all the talking.” 😂😂😂
Tehe 🤭
Oh no. It's Newcastle all over again 😂😂😂😂
i would actually like to see a loan to Lyon thank you
Messi 🐐🔥
En el salon de los traidores el caso wag fue una novela y junto a declan debio estar greailish jaja😂 todo genial
Who snuck Mudryk in here 😂 that guys trash

This season is looking amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Mbappé is real villain 😂😂
Newcastle over again😂😂😂
DID MESSI SAY SOCCER?!?!!?
4:40 mane take it seriously
Benzema taking out the wrong tape is just too funny.😂
they too realize that messi ronaldo era is coming to the ending 💔
Damn Messi😂
When Kane said oh no it's Newcastle all over again🤣🤣🤣
"It's Newcastle all over again". 😂😂😂
It’s Newcastle all over again!! Nahhh 😂
Lampard slipping like Gerard 😂😂😂
Bro this episode is chaos ☠
Parfait.
The Champions  "Florida Edition!"   MESSI PULLIN UP IN THE JETSKI 🤣🤣
No way Kane said it Newcastle all over again
Messi playing soccer now...
y'all deserve a Grammy award... like no kidding...!!
It's always the sarcasm for me😅
"Spurs Trophy Cabinet"   also literally NOTHING in it 😂😂  "Surplus Chelsea Players"   THE FOR SALE SIGN THO 🤣🤣
I can't stop laughing as soon as they fight, it's funny how they destroyed Spurs Trophy Cabinet and Sadio suddenly punching Sane for a second.
Benzema taking out the wrong tape is just too funny.. It’s so hilarious how unbothered Messi is .
Nahhh I love these videos I they where longer 😭
Is it me or are Haaland and Mbappe acting...fruity this season 😂
Eric and Chelsea, this was a fun one. 😎
How Mbappe pointed at Messi and said "look at the old man..." with his French accent is killing me😂😂
My soccer... BALL do the talking. Bloody Americans
Wtf where is the Inter players??? We are the second best team in europe
Please go back to usual😢😢😢😢
I was waiting for so long for a good screen treatment of Benzema and you're finally did it ! ☺
Where is jimmy butler
“OH NO IT’S NEWCASTLE ALL OVER AGAIN” 😂😂😂😂😂
Erling and Mbappe acting like Joker and Batman lmao. Completing each other
in terms of skill, mbappe is like messi(complete player) while haaland like ronaldo (mainly goal scorer), in terms of character, mbappe is like ronaldo ( a bit arrogant) while haaland like messi ( a bit weird)
Why is mbappe zesty 😂😂😂
SOCCER DO THE TALKING? Even as an American, IT IS NOT SOCCER IT IS GOD DAMN FOOTBALL
You 'd never lose in Toulouse😂😂😂 Great punchline
Why are the videos so short 😢
Please make 30 minute episodes 😅😅😂
Benzema with the Valbuena tape and Chelsea's surplus players had me dying  Also "It's Newcastle all over again" 😂😂
No Vinicius Jr?
First!!🎉
FRRR let's get this next gen GOAT drama started 🤣🤣
Mbappé whistling the french anthemc Grealo's accent and Harry with the Newcastle are the best this episode
mbappe whistling all you need is love by the beatles at 3:31
“Oh no!!! It’s Newcastle all over again” Man that line hurt but god it was funny AHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Seems without Messi and CR7 thé mansion and garden are dimmer
This storyline makes no sense I liked the old champions like season 1-4
"How bout u treat it like the French squad, and stay out of it"; 😂😂😂mbappe
Poor Jack can't eat
This is actually very nice, I love seeing Mbappe and Erling starting a sane rivalry
THIS IS WAY TOO SHOOOOORRTTT! WE NEED MOOOOORREEEEEEEE
You forgot rashford
It’s called soccer 🦅 🦅 🦅 🇺🇸
Honestly, I think Haaland isn’t Mbappe’s rival, Haaland isn’t really the next Ronaldo
This has been the best so far🤣
😂you never lose in toulouse, very funny
This episode is goldddd😂😂😂
We need Newcastle United in the series or a  champions premier league series
They keep sleeping on vini jr.
They keep sleeping on vini jr.
Yoo why is Mbappe so menacing🤣🤣
Go Toulouse they always loose 😂
I don't know about a new goat rivalry starting mbap and haaland are good but they are not goat status
The end tho💀😂🤣
Best episode of the new season so far❤
Benzema pulling out a Valbuena blackmail video was gold 😅
The best moments by far to me were Mbappe saying to benzema "treat this like the french team and stay out of it but kane saying this is newcastle all over again was gold.     Contex : why are you watching this if you dont know?
This series 😂😂😂
I want a team up between ronaldo and messi to stop this
THEY LISTENED TO ME AND ADDED MORE LEAO SCRENTIME UAY
This is next level amazing 🤩
You wanna know what funny? I turned the subtitles on just to hear what harry kane said.
0:11 i love how the only guy to notice mbappe’s french voice is another legendary baguette loving french man
You never lose in Toulouse 😂😂😂
ITS BACK
Did yall notice that mbappe had to stand on a stool just to Whisper in haalands ear😂😂
Haaland just being sweet is killing me💀❤️
Why is Mbappe so evil 😂😂😂
"when you are starting off your career at age five" got me laughing so hard 1:40
nice to see u back guys
The spurs banter😂😂😂 never g’ets old
Lampard "saving the day" in the end nearly killed me 🤣🤣🤣
The ConcaChampions
Not Lampard 😂😭
The truth lol
The way they represent Benzema blackmailing Mbappe is just so ironic 💀💀
Figo 🐷
Y is chelsea still here
Kane: it's like New Castle all over again 😅😅
Kane saying "its like New Castle all over again" made me crack up as an Arsenal fan
Kane yelling "it's Newcastle all over again" 😭😭
these players look better than in eafc 😂😂😂
God, we're getting to the point where we could have a whole series about the famous players at Inter Miami 🤣
Come out erling its not like you too go hiding 😂
Mbappe:" Stay out of it like you're from the French squad ". Awch
would be awesome 2 more shows xD
If the ending doesn't involve Messi with a shotgun and Ronaldo with a sword, I'm out.
Seeing Pedri and Gavi like that had me on the floor 😂
I actually really want to see "The Champions: Florida Edition", also "The Champions: Arab Edition" and "The Champions: Retro Edition". Please B/R make it real 😁
"pep said im not allowed to wonder " 💀
Kudos to whosoever wrote this script. Mbappe had some bars right there with "Ligue1, loan to Lyon and Toulouse losing everytime"😂
Messi never gonna say "soccer" 💀
why doesnt Leao have dreads ?
Messi is just basically flipping them off
Valbuena Blackmail 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10/10
"You know u can join me in leagon perhaps a loan to Lyon" gets me all the time 😂😂
Haaland sounds like Kermet the frog 😂
Whys the red bull teams get no love
Mbappe and Haaland will never enter thr goat debate. Best player in the world, yes. Goat? Not a chance
Messi is not bothered. We need the Florida edition.
NOT FOR SALE 💙😂😂😂😂
2:02 Haaland: "Pep says im not allowed to wonder"  Mbabe: "Ssshh, my sweet nordic man"  Dead😂🤣
4:28 Jack grealish should’ve had a bag, and it should’ve been damaged so he could say “oii, my Gucci bag”🥹
Its not the same
"oh No.... It's  Newcastle all over again" 😅😅
not sure how I feel about this
Cette série est divine et l'armoire à trophées vide des Spurs est hilarante! (oui un peu de commentaires en français ne fera pas de mal)
3:55 he said what we all know
4:32 for the Newcastle United fans
🥱
I feel this intro vibe. Man Saka really nailed it.
NGL this episode was kinda shit.
Norway will never challenge for the World Cup.  Lol
3:15  😂Haland saying am just gonna stick to tap in’s 😂killed me
We haven't had a season this fire since season 2. Glad to have you back.
The valbuena blackmail tape 😭
The only bad part about these episodes is that they are short.
I watched the Messi part about 100 times now. Have fun with your greedy reboot!!!
Why does trent looks like musiala
Now im wondering if the champions florida edition was just a joke or it was fr
Always wondered how you'd make Musiala look like. and now I finally got the answer and I love it!! :D
leo to miami，the champions to miami
4:38 Sadio's punch to Leroy🤣🤣
The Valbuena sex tape blackmail was so funny
"Oh no it's newcastle all over again had me dead"💀
Mbappe was spitting facts the whole episode, "your only a goalscorer"😭🤞
From football to soccer 🤣🤣🤣
Best one so far!!!!😂
Kane!!!! lol
Why is Pedri wearing number 10 shorts? Did I just spot a flaw?😮
Messi calling it soccer broke my heart
4:19 😂 kills me literally
MESSI, que hermoso verte relajado hasta en dibujitos disfrutas 😢😢🥺🥺🥺 como amo está serie
I didn't needed to actually read the name to know benzema would pick the wrong tape at first
3:42 Its more Farmers League
Still there are some salty a** bitch*s mad because Argentina won 😂
Who thinks up these stuff ?😂😂😂
Erling haaland: “I don’t want any trouble here; I’m gonna stick with tap-ins
Messi not giving a fuck in the beginning is so perfect
We demand this series of Champions like a Netflix series, each episode with 30+ mins!!
Messi : have fun with your pretty reboot kids ❤️😂
1:29 As an Irish fan, seeing Declan Rice holding an England jersey in the Garden of Treason warmed my heart
Hey, can you make longer videos? If not it’s fine.
My sweet Nordice nine 😂very rainbow
Why is Osimhen not incorporated? I mean Mudryk made it here
This is better than any netflix show!
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Damn, this is the best yet!! 🤣🤣🤣 Mbappe's rhymes were pretty clever!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its new castel all over agine🤣🤣
Longer episodes please 🙏🥺🥺
😂
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wander" has me in stitches 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mane bruh 😂
"Pep said Im not alowed to wonder"😂😂😂 Pep has them well drilled
We need The Champions Florida Edition and The Champions *SAAAAAAAUDIIII PROOOOOO LEAGUEEEEEEEE* Edition 😂
Hats down to writers.
The most hilarious moment is Mbappe trying to convince Erling to the Ligue 1 "You know, You could always join me in Ligue 1 Perhaps a loan to Lyon? You'd never lose in Toulouse😂
3:43 to 3:55 was the best imo bc of the rhymes
This is Cinema 🎉❤
Adding Mikel Arteta to the next gen intro is brilliant
Spurs trophy 😂
Super frank thinking he can fix everything then he "flops"💀😂😂😂😂😂
"Now my soccer does the talking" won't be the same as "Now my football does the talking"
It's going to be insane MLS fighting the Mexican clubs on the Champions lmao
As a NUFC fan it’s great to be mentioned again 😜✅🙏🏽👍🏽
the intro had me dieing
Great video
😂😂😂 the evil garden has a Rebecca Vardy  statue... Glorious 😂
Felt like a return to the first 3 seasons form.

Leo doesn't give a shit and it's glorious 😂
- ah sh*t, wrong one. - i’ll just stick to tap ins - do goals even count when you score for those clubs? - you’re just a goal scorer. - that’s a shirt sleeve too far - ahuhunnn (Mbappe’s laugh)  ..someone please help, my ribs hurt 😂😂🤣🤣💔
Words cannot express the amount of joy this series brings me
Every day a episode releases is  a good day every day its less than 10 min is sad
“It’s Newcastle all over again” 😂😂

Kane protecting Spurs trophy closet got me good

Jack Grealish eating Chinese takeouts from Starting 11 Cafe! Love the easter eggs!
Frank Lampard was jus chilling
Man , these guys know how to make great football comedy , and the funniest parts for me was Kane saying "It's Newcastle all over again" and Chelsea player and Mane punching Sane and Super Frank Lampard , basically everything 😂😂 😂
This serie deserves an oscar
The Mbappe Ligue 1 rhymes🔥
"How 'bout you treat this like the France squad and stay out of it?"😅😅😅😅
It's no longer the same😢
rafael leao has too be corrected,because his always smiling
Messi is above it all, truly
so true and funny
The Irish Guy would love seeing Declan Rice in the Garden of Treason.
Please never stop this show, it's too good!
YOOOO, with Messi on the MLS, maybe we can se players from the Liga MX on the series:')
"Do goals even count if you score for those teams?"  RIP League One😂
The introductions always kill me 😂😂😂
BUKAYOIII🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Bro the episode is really good but how did mbappe moved the chair when he talked to haland?😂
Messi talks too much trash in his special way and I like it😂
I love mbappe character in this😭
cant wait to see them both play for real in the future
HALLAND VS MBAPPE=RIVALS  VINICIUS JUNIOR=GOAT
A network must pick this up.
Harry Kane being shot with goals and saying "oh no, it's Newcastle all over again" 😂😂
Best part: Enter Garden of Treason... first statue: FIGO 🤣🤣🤣 This is just brilliant! Well done. Can't wait for the next one.
Bukayo Saka scaring us with his humility 😂
Can we actually get the real Messi to voice act in these episodes? like for real
Finally, Mikel Arteta And Saka.... Its worth waiting as an Arsenal Fan😅
This episode was so funny for no reason 😂
THE CHAMPIONS NEXT GEN VINICIUS JUNIOR YES🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
yessss
Finally Arsenal features
This is hilarious
i miss the other intro
Messi saying Soccer is criminal on so many levels 😂
Wrong tape 💀💀💀
this show is the most funny thing that exists today. I wish more people understood football just to enjoy this series. Im so sad i can't show it to my girlfriend, cuz she is simply out of topic.
Это выглядело топово, когда Мбаппе делал рифмы из названий клубов лиги 1
I laugh and i cry at the same time for one reason..
Keep focused on Kylian, this is dope. x)
The Figo statue nearly killed me xDDDD
Hey, How bout you treat this like the france squad and stay out of it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This season is looking very good CAN NOT WAIT FOR NEXT EPISODE!!!
ISS BACK
I will miss the intro 😭
This was too funny so much happening 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😭😭😭😭😭
Damn they really took it to the next level.. I'm liking it
Kane screaming "it's Newcastle all over again" HAHAHAHA
They missed out on Griezmann in the garden of treason
Kane it's Newcastle all over again.
is annoying that champions show is too short
why they gotta be too short
As an Arsenal fan, we've finally made it😂😂😂
No matter what generation we will be at, there will never be a legendary generation as we had with Messi-Ronaldo era and for me, the champions will just never be the same as it used to x\  but hey, I will stil enjoy this, but no way it will be as the 6 first seasons season 6 is probably my best because of the lore and every single one of us wishing that the era never ends but oh well ...  I also, didnt get the rebecca one ?
Messi meatriding goes crazyyyyyy ☠☠☠
How is there nothing about United 😖
im not gonna lie this is the best season apart from the 1st and the 3rd
Always
bro i very like your videos plz dont stop this season you are very agoat
Messi should be in it
Halland vs Mbape the battle of the titans
It's Newcastle all over again LMAO COLD !!
Im glad you made another one
Mbappe whistle is a refrece of Death from puss in boots?
The messi one demolished and devoured by soul ... it is the honest truth, and you need to be this deep into the game to see how it went Messi ever since winning the WC is fed up in a way you know ? like he isnt even trying to play the game, and doesnt want to play it on a high level ...  I am positive he could have signed for Barçelona yet, he decided to "run away" to a country that calls football "sucker" (intented) what I want to say, yes messi isnt eternal, but he has no right to prevent us from profiting of his magic as long as he can provide x'(  Mbappé should be stoppped ... he is going INSANE!
“Now I let my soccer do the talking”  -Lionel Messi
Arsenal is finally here 😢
😂😂 love the show !
Im surprised no one noticed the detail at 3:14 of how benzema’s phone is actually recording what’s happening
😂this show is fun
wow this is one of the best episodes yet. currently rolling on floor
The Erling part of "blur blur blur" was spot on 😂 i remember he did that against Ben Godfrey.. against Everton😂🤣🤣
Finally an Arsenal play can be seen .
Mbappe and Haaland are too far away from each other to be proper rivals. Either both go to La Liga, or Mbappe ends up somehow in the premier league
Next gen😢💔
Saka
WHY IM LATE TO THISSSSSSS😢😢😢
Try l wey in champions
Mbappe will die of laughter watching this
OH NO IT'S NEWCASTLE ALL OVER AGAIN 😱🤣
Thanks, Mbappe. I now know how to pronounce Ligue 1... I think🤔 You have a strong French Accent Context: I've been pronouncing Ligue 1 as League one this entire time.
gg
I wish that s7 E1 was about 🇩🇪 beats 🇧🇷 and Neymar has ptsd and Thomas makes fun of  and the Germans have a festival invites Neymar and he goes insane and almost kills Thomas muller Just saying
It’s it just me or does Harland sound like one of the muppets😂
“Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder”😂
Mbappe telling Haaland to come to Ligue 1 clubs, as if he himself doesn't want to leave it right now 💀
I kinda wanted a storyline of Messi being evicted from the Champions house since he's moving to Inter Miami, but him giving zero shits what's happening is funny as hell 😂😂
"Do goals even count if you score for those clubs" 💀💀💀
MLS Champions LOL
2:09 “Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder” Haaland 😭
you never lose in Toulouse haha
Missed the opportunity to make Grealish say “aye watch out my Gucci bag!!”
"Its Newcastle all over again!" I just can't 😂😂💀💀
why does Mbappe and Benzema have an American accent lool
Mbappe and Erlin will never be better than messi nor break his records 👍👍👍....what messi has archieved is now untouchable..
Is no one talking about mbappe's whistling is a very familiar rhythm 🤔
Let's goo!
i love how mbappe whistles the marseille song
Opening become worst
you will never be marca toons
Kane saying it's New Castle all over again 😂, love the small details
But yeah, MLS getting a boost with these transfers.
Hearing Messi calling football 'soccer' send chills down my spine. Nooooooooo... As always goat CL video guys.
Can you please change haalands hair??
"Oh no, it's Newcastle all over again" harry kane killed me😂😂😂
The sad part is Earling probably won't ever win a WC with Norway the same way CR7 didn't with Portugal :/ kind of a bummer that on the international stage there's just like 5 teams that are a monolith to get past
We need el wey in the series🙏
I can stop laughing mane and sane haha
Declan rice 🐍🐍.    🙌🇮🇪
please bring the brazilian clubs examples: São Paulo, Flamengo, Grêmio (Luis Suárez's team), Palmeiras and Vasco
Spurs trophy cabinet 😂😂
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
Mudryk TOP 🔝 Level
Mbappe rhyming UberEATS teams 😂😂
Best episode ever. Been waiting to see Big Earl in the sky blues. Todd Boehly to turn the Premier League into the MLB?| Will Generation Foot take the League Title?! https://youtu.be/fvxg1XYIoeg😊
4:41 what was that haaland😂
This level of humour needs to be rewarded 😂😂✨. You've earned all my likes♥️
They did my boy Benz bad with the blackmail tape 😂😭
mbappe doesn't even know what a VHS cassete is lol
Man this was boring
Victor Osimhen not in this? I have sure I have seen a BR content where he is highly regarded...
BR riding Messi's jock again. Total BS series
This was straight up disrespectful to CR7
The new intro is fire🔥
There's two trams in Florida and 🦁💜🦁
Oh it’s Newcastle all over again 😂😂😂 LMFAO
Hello
That empty Tottenham trophy cabinet though. Low blow…and hilarious.
Wow this was such an amazing episode🔥👍
It´s cool so cool, good work man, but I hate why Halland has that old haircut in series, give him the new one that pony tail or smt like that pls
If it would be an Oscar for YouTube best animated series, The Champions would definately be nominated.
Pep said im not allowed to wonder😅😅😅
Villain Mbappe is GOATED!😂
yo, imagine if ishowspeed was in this season
When you start your professional career at age five 😂... The first hilarious line after the intro
Pep says I’m not allowed to wondee 😂
Best episode ever
I hope they do an  episode about the new el clasico rivality
Next the champions saudi edition
Its making me sad that we are seeing a great era's end. For me, the champions next gen will not be like the old ones 😢 they were and still special. At least for me 💔💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹😭🥺
'How 'bout you treat this as the french squad, and stay out of it' 😂😂
Yup. After 3 episodes, officially the worst season. Really bad jokes, missing horribly. 2 year break for this trash 😂 won’t be watching anymore. Shit is garbage now
😂😂😂😂😂 totally saw it coming tbh
Oh no it's Newcastle all over againnnn
This is really an and to the età isnt it
Oh here we goo I was dreaming about this today
I love how even though Chelsea are out of the mansion, they still get a bunch of pot shots
Look how the Messi Cristiano rivalry turned out for Ronaldo 😂😂😂
"do goals even count if you score for those clubs?" 😂😂😂😂
Yal need to make a mbappe boner joke
This is poetry at it's finest. You guys know the deal. Keep it up.
Great series as always, but it’s criminal how Nigerian Superstar, Victor Osimhen, has been excluded from this series. Man was an absolute goal machine last season.
3:13 "How about you treat this like the France squad and stay OUT of it" 😂 Mbappe, FAM, no need for that level of disrespect
Mbappe didn’t have to do benzema like that.
2:08 Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder. Hahahaha.
why are chelsea players keep being included? annoys me so much
Please can you tell me where you get the episodes from I do not see it on Netflix anymore
The spurs trophy cabinet 😂
Good
Well if Haaland won't do it then maybe vinicius jr will
“How about you treat this like the France squad and *Stay out of it* 💀💀
Mbappé is definitely the bad guy😅
5 minutes is too short ,who agrees ?
😂😂😂 "You never lose in Toulouse ".... "They lose all time"... 😂😂😂😂😂
kvaratskhelia=(
Its Newcastle all over again 😂😂😂
WWHY MBAPPE IS BEING SO ZESTY AND HOMO TO HAALAND WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT RIVALRIVES
Come on 4:38 Mane 😂😂😂
"pep said I'm not allowed to wonder" killed me 😂
Mbappe Ligue 1 rhymes was really nice 😂😂😂
I need to see Osimhen on this man😂
The ending song is best
1:57
Mbappe needs to come to Arsenal to rival Haaland,
I honestly look forward to these more than any TV show these days.
Mane punching sane was the funniest thing ever
Kane mentioning Newcastle got me 😂
Is that Florida thing real if so I would so watch it. Time for Leo to let his soccer do the talking 😁
The true: vini jr will win the ballon before mambape
Anyone notice that mbappé whistled the German anthem 3:32
stick to tap ins😹
It won't be the same. When they retire, the football will die.
2:21 mbabbe standing on a chair to match hallands height is tooo funny😂😂
Does anyone know what happened to their group chat after season five
Waiting on the Shakira and Messi banter scene in the florida addition😂
Benzema pulling out the vabuena blackmail 😂😂
4:50 should have been gerrard slipping
I am Atleast Happy That Messi will Appear In Further episode, But also sad for Ronaldo 😁😢
I wanna award the whole team of  B/R football.......  Just an  amazing episode 😍
I'm just gonna stick to tap-ins 😂😂😂
Kane: it's Newcastle all over again 😅
Wow this was apn amazing episode please make more and don't take to long thank u for everything
1:41 That’s why you’re still an Angel when everyone else is quite devil 1:56 Note: Leo is chilling but he’s definitely not deaf 2:36 Brain wash failed 2:50 Mbappe has betrayed him once when rumours said that he would go to Real but actually he stayed at PSG because they gave him more money 2:53 Years has passed and we still cannot get over what he have done to Valbuena 2:58 Anyways tape master 3:41 Way too many ‘girlfriends’ heh?😂 4:27 Oh he’s not drunk for once😂 4:34 Oh Calm down Harry, the world is not ending but just 2 youngster feuding like child play, you shall care more about the empty stuff behind you 4:38 Shit loads of Chelsea trash players waiting to be sold 4:40 Mane even feels that punching Sane is so right. Bayern can no longer maintain peace here 4:51 There he goes, doing a John Terry 5:05 DOOOOONNNNTTTTT
Super Frank can fix this!
I’m a spurs fan but when Kane said it’s Newcastle all over again that got me laughing
Please never stop making these they are hilarious and make my day ❤
Pedri and Gavi 😂😂😂
Wait wait wait. You say that will be a champions Florida edition 🌴🇺🇲????
Jeddah edition
If they make a spin off in the mls itd be really funny with how Leo dosent give a shit bout the tomfoolery any more also mbappe being the villain is honestly great
I want the champions but with another languages like Spanish french German Italian Japanese Korean and other languages
This one is the best one yet
Messi really said s*ccer
Pep said I'm not allowed to wonder. -Erlimg Haaland
Awesome talent💥👈
Why dies haaland sound like kermit the frog 🤣😂
Messi not caring about anything anymore,Benzema bringing out hte Valbuena tape,Kane reliving the 6-1 against Newcastle,The England unicorn easter egg,Mane punching Sane... This could actually be the best champions episode in history😌
"Pep says Im not allowed to wonder "😂😂😂😂😂
Where’s vini???? He needs to be in this competition with mbappe and haaland
That Mane punch! 😂
"You did never lose in Toulouse!" 😂
Erling Hidin
valbuena blackmail💀
That mane and Sane reference was so uncalled for 😂😂😂😂😂
“players stop fussin, and start BUSSIN” 💀💀💀
Why is benzema still wearing the Real Madrid shirt 💀😭
Messi at the end, I'll let my soccer do the talking is pure gold😂😂😂😂
Lame!!!!
It's new castle again 😂😂😂
Mbappe to the prem please!
WE will see an mbapee vs halland After Messi vs ronaldo
"Now I let my soccer do the talking" is one of the top 10 quotes of all time
2:08  "pep says i'm not allowed to wonder" I'm dead 💀💀💀
Yj
oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa🔥🔥🔥🔥
4:39 that punch tho 💀
Messi saying the word Soccer made me uncomfortable
3:29 6.5 tall gaint afraid of a turtle 🤣
Why did y’all add osihnmen this is outrageous 📌😠🤬😣😢
I wonder if Mbappe watches these 😂
No one has mentioned Mbappe’s line to Benzema “Treat this like the French team and stay out of it!” This had me dying 😂😂
This is so funny
"Pep doesn't allow me to wander"
its newcastle all over again🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:41 - 3:52
"I'll just stick to my tap-ins." 😂🤣 Isn't that the truth!!
I love this serie but the episodes are way too short to be honest :(
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder" 😂😂😂😂
My man Lamps put a smile on my face at the end...
Yeah! A champions Season with more than 3 episodes!   Also, Messi getting his own Champions spinoff? I'll give it a watch.
Ever since winning the WC, Messi has checked out, and deservedly so. So much slander cuz of his international heartache  Bro deserves this retirement
Benzema pulling out Valbuena's blackmail tape was quality
In other words... IT'S ON!
Like u guys are leaving vini Jr out of the debate
Funniest episode in a while
I can’t wait to see The Champions (Florida Edition) I’m going to Florida soon, and it’ll be great to see it then.
Florida edition 👀👀👀
where tf was alvarez??????
Mane punching Sane . 😂😭
RIP LAMPARD
I have no idea what is going on so I’m hooked
Apparently Kane is still traumatised after the game against Newcastle 💀💀 4:32
this is the most funniest shit ever
I'M SO HYPED FOR FLORIDA ADDITION?
Haalnad and mbappe won't be the same as messi and ronaldo messi complete the game ronaldo hold some crazy records and mbappe won the world cup and haaland won the ucl but haaland and mbappe don't got them ballon d'or like messi and ronaldo haaland have a good chance win this ballon d'or  but messi probably going win it
Messi winning the idgaf war is so in character 😂
이강인 음바페 파리생 LET'S GO
The valbuena joke is crazy 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The fact that Mbappe can never be more likable than Haaland and that Haaland plays for a real league unlike Mbappe, warms my heart so much 😂
If Nashville sc is not in Florida edition then I will be so pissed
Mbape: You will never lose in TooLouse Haland: You will never scores goals as many as I do Mbape : We will never challenge in World cup  😂😂😂
4:39 always sane and mane😂
Don't  make  mbappe look  evil
Valbuena blackmail hahahahahha
This season so far it’s great
Messi just not giving a fk about anyone BS . My goat , you deserve it
Mbappe is a real villain IRL
The way they portray Haaland 💀 esp while they were in the garden
😂😂😂😅
Yeahhh!!
I like the new intro
This one is the best season 🔥😩❤️..
lmao they actually mentioned the valbuena thing
seeing messi say soccer was the worst thing ever
😂😂😂
Perfect way to end a Monday
“See how the rivalry turned out for Ronaldo” got me rolling 😭
best episode so far
Who compare Haaland with Mbappe, Mbappe is ten times better then Haaland
More Musiala please 🙏🙏
Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder 😂😂😂
The thing I needed today ❤ CHAMPIONS!
I love this show
"AH SHIT wrong one"   Benzema 2023
The Spurs vs Newcastle reference from Kane 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"French chuckle"
Good
Not many will understand the Valbuena tape. It's so old xDDD
The amount of Easter eggs are amazing 🤩🤌🏿
Next Gen is 🔥
🚢🌹🐝Haaland>Mbappè 🏆🗼🐓
Where is arsenal
Pog innit fam
Harland a bum
4:42
Messi doesnt give a sht about them is so funny,but its true,theres nothing more for him to achieve.true goat
Great content as usual keep up the good work
Why bring lampard into this 😂🤌🏽
Haaland shit housing is funny
One question : why put all the most important player of the  winner of the most important league and no one from ssc napoli? Even if they have young star like Kvara and osi that can be in line whit the young replace the old player theme
Nobody gon talk about Chelsea surplus players😅
Fun fact : in the intro the two superstars are messi and ronaldo
the champions mantion war 7/10/2023 to ?/??/????  the good: halland , ronaldo, Neymar, benzema,( and possibly muller and Messi) vs  the football axis: umpppe, psg squad, infantino,
this episode was absolute gold i swear
1:45 Mbappe is too creepy 😮😂
LMFAOOOOOO   SADIO 😂😂😂🥊
Finally, an Arsenal character 😊
Kane: "It's newcastle all over again " made me lol
Ahh just want the episodes to be longer
Benzema finger not real
not Mbappe whistling the french anthem lmao
Super frank 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
3:41 is killing me 😂
Grealish’s gucci bag should’ve gotten hit with of the footballs
lampard and Messi top !!!😆😆😆😅😅😆😆😆
Amazing!!!!! Messi is the best
BRO THEY GOT REBEKAH VARDY IN THIS SHIT😂😂😂😂😂
3:10 sounds like a reference in the World Cup, where Ben didn’t play at the beginning and even that end after qualifying for the final
finally, more benzema
CMON YES
The jokes in this series are elite 😂
The “Valbuena Blackmail” tape had me dying 😂😂😂   “Ah shit, wrong one” hahaha
the amount of references shows how much effort they put into this
Remember what the teach said when some kids getting bullied?   "They just a kid. They just playing around together"
4:48 pfff, with the subtitles on it Literally says   "Super frank can fix this [Flops]"
This is like star wars,    Minor spoilers:     Haaland being the Jedi side trying to save the world (and the footballers)  Mbappe being the sith trying to destroy all the old footballers!
Treat it as the French quad and stay out of it 😂😂
Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder 💀💀💀 2:12
Usually i’m against Change but i’m Ready for this season a cameo isn’t bad from pervious players but totally understand time for the future
Gritty reboot... yeah.  We are still getting those, I blame Tim Burton for starting the trend with the Batman's reboot.  Adam West is no more.
Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder has me rolling😂😂😂
Spurs trophy cabinet 💀
“Super Frank can fix this, or not”😂
"Pep said I'm not allowed to wonder"😂
Why this madman(Kylian) is so desperate to be in a rivalry. Bro, first you need to be loved by a lot of people like Messi or Ronaldo. Then people can judge.
I like how mbappe is acting like a women to Haaland 😂
Oh no, its newcastle all over again. Lmfao had me dying
Best way to start the week 😂
This seems like they’ve made this program gay, what a shame I’m going to stop watching this from now on.
OMG the Valbuena tape one took me out completely 😭😭😭💀💀💀
Haaland v Mbappe aint it
It's funny one is sucking on their Nathaniel team and another is sucking on their club team.
Benzema’s blackmail tape, the Sadio Mane punch reference and Mbappe whistling the Marseilles killed me, this season is looking good. Also Leo chilling and winning the idgaf war.
So far this season will be GREAT!!!!
This was so funny😂😂😂😂 Kane: "oh on it's Newcastle all over again"😂😂😂
Can’t wait for the Florida edition😂
Mbappe with the eren yeager character arc is gonna be epic
As a Man City fan, this is the very first time I have heard a Haaland 'tap in' slander that I wasn't offended about. 🤣🤣🤣🤣.  Hilarious!
" oh no ! It's Newcastle all over again" 😂
Man,i love Mbbape the way he tries to trick Halland
It’s new castle all over again 😭
3:12 reference to Benzema not playing in the France national team 4:32 Once again spurs no trophies  And harry doesn’t have 1   Like the new animation style it’s more smooth when they move
Another one
I'm getting annoyed by this thing of making the videos so short🤧 they are too nice to be doing this to us
Genuinely hilarious show
The Benzema tape joke was class💀
The way Mane punched Sane finished me 😂😂😂😂😂
*Spurs trophy cabinet*  Oh boy, please 😭  I laugu so much with Kane still protecting Spurs  Good episode  Messi still having GOATouch in each episode
Please, never skip an ad on this channel!
The Kane joke 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:37 So no one gon talk about the “AGUERROOOOOOOOO” painting or picture behind Mbappé 😂
Im gonna stick to tap ins😂😂😂
3:32 Mbappe 💀💀💀
Florida edition will be crazy  Can’t wait
Mane 😂
Most entertaining season yet!Better drama than a real show!🔥🔥
plis make this season longer!
Why do Spurs and Chelsea still appear? One of them isn't even in Europe period.
You should add someone else to rivlary vlahovic or garnacho or Bellingham
and che
The next gen intro instead of the newer one legit gave me chills after 7 seasons of our classic one. Football really is changing.
Oh yeah Champions❤🔥
why was tot in the vid
you are good
Ronaldo is by far the best scripted character in this show....I'm gonna miss him <3
As someone who is born and raised in Miami, champions florida edition would be the wildest series of all time
I miss Cris and Leo but the Next Gen looks promising lol.... Cant wait for the Florida Edition✨✨✨✨
I feel like when szn 8 comes out next year it won't be the same, I mean Ronaldo isn't in szn 7 and next szn Messi will be in Miami and Neymar is rumored to go to Saudi.
Ronaldo?
Kane saying "It's Newcastle all over again" took me out 🤣
Ngl When Mbappé pulled out that gun I felt like running
His face 😂 4:41 😂🇳🇴
Hello
It’s so sad not seeing  Ronaldo and Messi in the into
Seeing Messi not give single f*ck and just enjoying life is everything us Messi fans hoped for Leo 🥺
I can’t wait until the next episode
Finally! A Cartoon version of "Bambi" @ 1:17 😍 Also, why is Cartoon Mbappé so creepy?
The masterpiece is back! I love The Champions in every presentation.
That Mbappe Rhyme
As an American is feels so good to say Leo plays for Miami so we can say he plays for a league the MLS
4:27 LMAOOOOOOOOO
2:56 Shit wrong one 😂
Why is Pedri wearing number 10 at the intro?
Episode four, episode four
This season is soooooooo fxcking good!!!! "pep told me not to wonder" hahahaha
This episode was PEAK comedy but why did ya'll do my boy Leroy like that🤣🤣
I almost chocked to death when super Frank couldn’t fix it
The best!!! Especially the reference to Tottenham vs Newcastle made me laugh 😂😂😂😂😂
The evil guy shifted from being Ramos to Mbappe😂
Noooooooooooo! take me back to the CR7 and Messi days
French chuckles . Lol
that blackmail scene was out of pocket😂
You guys are just amazing!!
It’s so hilarious how unbothered Messi is 😂😂😂
😭 only true fans will no what this means to there heart
Woah next gen era kinda dark
Make it longerrrr
Mbappé will never amount to much while in the French League
The champions is sick and incredible 👏. Pls post daily fantastic video 📹 👏
Suiii is back
Old one was better
The Champion will never STOP MAKING ME LAUGH 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Erlang to lyon😂😂😂😂😂😂
" a loan to Lyon "  🤣🤣 we are not even a top Ligue 1 club anymore ..      😢
« You never lose in Toulouse ...»😂😂
"Look he's using you Erling, look how the Messi-Ronaldo story turned out for Cristiano" Ouch Benzema didn't have to go that far
4:32 Harry Kane 😅😅😅😅
Haaland is unbelievably wholesome this episode he sounds so cute ❤❤
The way that mane sais a swear word ans then punched sané was so funny 🤣
I  enjoy that moment when Kane said that Newcastle all over again 😂😂
4:34 gold
These animations are a pure joy!
Messi said the word "SOCER"
bro mbappe became death for like 10 seconds where he enters haalands room
Haland Vs Mbappe
The valbuena reference 💀
It would be great we saw every Champions League around the world
A dark version indeed lol
4:49  honestly sums up our season really
Thanks for making sure this is not just 3 episodes
😂 Amazing series.
What are the Chelsea players doing there ??? They're not even in the Conference league
Bro don't remove the golden intro. There is no need of it to be called NEXT GEN
Was mbappe just whistling Erika
Looking forward to the Florida edition
now im gonna let my soccer do the talking is insane
Evil Mbappe? Yes😂😂😂😂
the Erling haaland voice looks like human's one. That is the only unrealistic point here. He should have a C3P0 voice like in the real life.
I'm waiting for the el wey
Not the Valbuena tape😂😂😂
W
Hey, Kane sounds like he has been seeing a speech therapist, and making progress.  Good for him.
Lmao Leo just not caring has me dying
Let's say Football: Next Gen.
YAY
love the Newcastle reference (4:32)
Messi's so good he moves to Florida and br football makes a new show
AYO KYLIAN BE ACTING EXTRA SUS
The florida edition 😂❤
This series is PURE GOLD
4:41 The Haaland vs. Ben Godfrey gesture 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i need erling to be more savage his no silly guy
its still great seeing leo here
mbappe got the death wistle
"OH NO It's New Castle all over again" God I love it when they make fun of Spurs, He's also in front of an empty cabinet😂.
The Messi I don't care reaction is the most accurate thing ever, the man just doesn't give a shit anymore
Mbappe is the JOKER 😂
This will be badass
Lampard at the end had me crying
Just another average rivalry
Mbappe being a bit sus 🤨
This theme so is still so fire 🔥
Kylians plan is working some how
This has more twists than how much i do in my bed
Not the mane punch 😂😂
eh
this is the only gossip i'm into
It’s Newcastle all over again, I get this line  😂😂😂😂
omg please more florida edition with the real GOAT
1:56 enjoy your life messi 🏆 🥇 🇦🇷 😆
Nooooo Messi is football
5:53 messi being chill and having a light is goated 😂
I like that they kept Haaland's old hair
I can't wait for episode 4
Just imagine for the final episode for this season, it’s Haaland and the old players vs Mbappe and the young players in a football match
Something in the Mbappe - Haaland - scene makes me sad
Another W Episode by B/R Football.
Seeing messi chillin is so chillin'
This season Mbappe could go to Real Madrid, and then we'll start seeing a REAL rivalry
LOCKED INNNNN
U lost me at Soccer
Benzema never gonna live down those scandals lol
I lost it @ 2:53 when Benzema pulled out Vambuena’s sex tape 😂😂😂
Figo statue with the pig head... The old days 😂 I like this new direction of the series. Making Haaland a beautiful and shining human being and Mbappe an evil SOB looking for power, chaos, division and conquer. Well done boys. Well done 👍
Pep said i'm not allowed to wonder 😂😂
Was that an Omar from the wire reference with Kylian walking into the room whistling?
who ever disliked the intro like my comment!
Kane saying it's new castle all over again 🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the series. Please keep going. ❤❤
“Pep says I’m not allowed to wonder”😂😂😂
Soon or later yu should involve "el wey" in this season
NOOOOOOOOOO MESSI SAID SOCCER
The Ronaldo Slander continues. Unwarranted. He is a GOAT
can someone explain wh  Haaland made that gesture in 4:40? it looks like his dad told him to go paly in the MLS next Season
1:56 FACTS 😌
The room with the hat trick ball is too much 🤣🤣
Thanks for another masterpiece
Pedri and Gavi XD
ahhhhh,messi is just world cup and chill,you know?
omg I never thought id see the day arsenal was in one of these. we are so fucking back
lol very good
4:32 Nooooo hahahahaha XD
that mane punching sane scene made me lose it 😂😂😂
😂😂Messi saying he doesn't care is the best 💅
The way mbappe quickly entered the building 😭
It is newcastle all over again
Amazing episode!
I hope their is an explaination on Jack Grealish eating Chinese food and yes no Gucci Bag is involved here.
Honestly the creativity behind this show is amazing
Damn never exepted season mbappe plan is the most plot twist of plot twist of plot twist 0:15
we need the 10 mins episodes back pls B/R ?
I wonder if they will do a Champions Florida to keep messi in the seriers
Benzema's tape reference requires high football IQ😂
mane punching coman lol😆
benzema having Vabuena blackmail tape is funny
Los jugadores del futuro
What happens when a specific number of players depending on MLS' legislation live under the same roof? Players stop being polite and start getting ... Rowdy. This is The Champions Florida Edition.  Higuain: I finally figured out how to play in MLS, retires and then Messi joins. I'm sure it was just a coincidence since Lionel fainted when he saw me. Alba: Apparently the Americans mistook me for Jessica Alba, but at least I met a Real Madrid who started to watch soccer when it was announced that Messi was joining. Nani: Yes, I may have left Orlando a couple years ago, but Miami hasn't left our shadows since. Josef Martinez: I wanted to turn the tables on Atlanta by joining Miami. Turns out that throwing the table with chicken and rice in Atlanta was a terrible mistake.  Rodolfo Pizarro: It's not every day the manager who exiled you from your national team is sacked and then takes over your club. Perhaps that's why Beckham blocked me when I asked him when I can meet Messi.
It would be amazing if Mbappe comes to Premier League... Just not Liverpool or Manchester United. May be Newcastle United. Lol
the slap from mane hahahaaha
The punch from mane got me hahahaha😂😂😂
This season is starting off very good to be honest
They are really fast these days keep it up 😊😊
best serie ever
Tottenham cabinet 🕸️😂
Haaland is to kind  and waḧat i the name on benzema phone singal in episode 2
They should make the champions next gen a new series!
Messi 🐐
THIS SEASON LOOKS AMAZING
I wanted to make a football edit but I couldn’t resist man I’m actually annoyed
😂😂😂😂messi doesn't care
Why are the episodes soo short??😩😩😩😩
I love how little there is of the footballers playing football
This season is funny asf
Wow and came here at 320 minutes
Well that "it's newcastle all over again" from Kane got me 😅😅
The Garden of Treason? Im surprised that Sol Campbell didnt  have a statue🤔
It is interesting to see how this Champions is shaping up post GOAT era
"Now I let my soccer do the talking"
Why is Chelsea still in that house? I'm a Chelsea fan btw 🤣😂😢😭😭😭😭
hi
Yesssssss
I love Kane’s reaction on Haaland-Mbappe’s rivalry😆 It brings him back to St.James Park nightmare last season and trophyless for 14 years
The beginning of the saga was so thrilling and epic,now there's so less versatility.the era just faded into oblivion
The WAGatha Christie statue 🤣
I had to turn the subtitles on for Harry Kane just to double check what he said LOL
pedri saying teehee 💀
Mbappe and Haaland acting sus fr ngl.
I can't wait to see mbappe and haaland as the main characters this season
this is epic
😂😂😂
Banger of an episode
I do like this series but I feel like these guys don’t respect the USA, yes the msl and usl are viewed way less then the European leagues but Miami is not like the rest of the us. We care about the sport and it’s the first I ever played. In Miami we use both soccer and football (futbol) here so when Messi says “now I let my soccer speak for me” that’s more of an insult to Miami then a joke but I do see the joke
This is gonna be the best season
we never see mason mount in the champion :>
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder"😂😂😂 "Do goals even count for those clubs"🤣🤣🤣🤣 Never change Erling
Chelsea have NO right to be seen in this 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:00 "What was the worst part about my first season in Chelsea?" I thought he would say "everything" 😂  P.S. So glad to see Mudryk included in Champions episode 💙💛
Messi chill af, real GOAT gives no sht LOL😎
I want next episode 10 minutes long
From Yellow aura to Blue aura? Ballon D'iamond is a thing?
5:08 last time I wanted to slap the shit out of Messi was when Neymar influenced his hairstyle, but this is out right treason
Messi said soccer
Glad to see Arsenal finally in Champions Mansion, but I really miss Messi and Ronaldo 😞
These series are getting more and more detailed ans I'm OBSESSED
Mane punshing Sane was hilirious😂
Messi had his last laugh back in Dec 18, and now he has nothin to worry about. AT ALL😂😂😂
To be honest Mbappe is way More invested in this weird rivalry when haaland has plenty more deserving rivals
Mane casually punching Sane just because he saw the chaos, gets me every time 😂
The Champions: Money Era plssss
Как же ахуенно
Can we see more of Ronaldo ? ❤
4:32 "Oh, no! This is Newcastle all over again" I almost died 😂
"I need you to do better in the champions league for you to be my rival" Mbappe just went from black to charcoal with that burn ☠☠
Man make the episodes longer plsss
Harry Kane: Oh no, It's Newcastle all over again! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That lost to Newcastle
OH MA GOD
This feels like a new ninjago season at the start😂
The intro was nice tho but hyped up for this season cuz its going to be🔥
Last 5 secs of Messi is absolute gold...😂😂😂😂
That was to short btw I like
Oh. My. God. These just keep getting better and better! 🔥❤
Harry Kane talking about the Newcastle thrashing was satisfying to see
Make it netflix series or tell us how to pay for more of these
After what Mbappe said about psg in the interview, him being the evil is genius
Yo The Champions Florida Edition sounds fire
One might want to ask. Where is Rashford in all of this 🥲🙃
So many little digs 😂
Messi just not giving a fuck now is the best part of this
Mbappe as the villain is just fitting 😂😂😂
why is pedri #10 1:14
"Not to worry, lads. Super Frank can fix this!"
2:12 Mbappe acts sus
Lampard did the Gerrard😂
😂😂😂
you'll never loose In Toulouse 😅😅😅
Whens that florida edition coming out
Love the episodes!
2:00 is literally me when I saw the reboot… like why change anything when you have something good already. If it good - don’t fix it!
I feel like the seasons are getting better each time
messi hearing their plot and not caring at all is so so so funny
The champions mansion will never be the same without Cristiano and Messi lol 😂
Man I love Florida and the champions this is gonna be great
Early best season till now imo
Can you pls lower Mbappes voice it sounds like he's talking like real life Ronaldo I kinda hate it TBH
They honestly outdid themselves. So many funny references. Kudos to the writers. Had to try so hard to compose myself at work lmao
that was amazing i hope theres more
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder[wander]" 🤣🤣
‘Pep said I’m not allowed to wonder.’ Haaland😂
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious thats the longest word that has been commented surely i deserve a pin?
I don’t want any trouble here I am gonna stick to tap ins 😂😂
Br football u are the best youtuber that’s why I subscribed with notifications on that’s why I’m here early
Florida Edition should be interesting 😅😂
"soccer"
I wouldn't put it past Mbappe
"You're just a goal scorer" Mbappé spoke fact! Haaland is just a goal scorer and nothing more
Anyone going to say that Erling sounds like Kermit the Frog
wait a damn minute, did Mbappe whistled the "German" Soldier Anthem?!
this is looking real good, cant wait to see how this rivalry plays out!
1:57 Have fun on the Plotting Reboot. 😂
Halland sound like Elmo 😂
😂
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH 😭💕
Finally Benzema gets some attention on The Champions… Too bad he left for Saudi Arabia
Gavi and Pedri at the beginning 😭😂
I like when Mane Accidentaly Punch Sane 😂
As a Norweegian its so funny and kinda hurts when mbappe said : norway will never challenge for the world cup😂😂 it hurts, but its true, its the only thing better with mbappe then Haaland, the nation he is from😂😂
Nothing to lose in Toulouse.. 😂😂
Messi really said "I'll let my soccer do the talking" 💀💀💀 5:00
Finally u upload it
Nice video please keep up the amazing effort and videos.
Well that escalated quickly
Messi really went from letting his football do the talking. Now it’s his soccer 😔
Glad we are getting more episodes than 3! :D
Messi saying soccer nearly killed me
3:57 Mbappe should go to the prem!
I'm so here for messi not giving a shit and chilling on a floaty no matter the location
Benzema: oh sh*t, wrong one 💀😭
So many easter eggs. This season is going to be lit.🔥
"pep says i'm not allowed to wander" 😭
New intro made me choke because I laughed so hard
NEW EPISODE WOO
I hate Saudi Arabia, so for me the season was not a great pleasure so far but hey they ruin football and its portrayed very well.
The amount of hearts in the comment section
I am from Toulouse💜💜 and then loose sometimes, not all the time😂😂
Messi not giving shit about kylian talking about replacing him and ronaldo knowing damn well no one can replace them
1:15 why pedri wears Number 10
That was great!
2:16 I’m gettinghard
That Valbuena joke was class
yooooooooo
"you can join me in ligue un, perhaps a loan to Lyon" 😅😅😅  "You never loose in Toulouse "😅😅😅😅😅
😂😂😂stick to tap-ins
Me right now: hahahahhahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahaahahhahahahahahahahan Bruh mbappe and haaland have a it now? Just like Messi and Ronaldo had it in la liga???1?11??1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1
Talk about the Qatari league
Did Erling just say,  ' I'm going to stick to tap ins.' Thats wild 😂
Nah the way the intro sounded like what a Gen z would say, cracked me up 😂
Nah the Valbuena blackmail is crazy💀💀💀
Mbappe is a true villain 😃
'Pep says I'm not allowed to wander...' 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Haha Lionel Messi is something that they cant reach anymore, btw so much drama :3 i hope Barca players get more protagonism this season
Oooooo, new videos from the 🐐. Comment true if u all agree with me
What are non champions league clubs doing here😂
thanks for being the cure of depression on blue mondays :D
This season is gonna be so good
Lampard who ‘flops’ 😂😂
We need more episodes like this
Go back to the old season please
"Pep says I'm not allowed to wonder"😂😂
Ffs just make this a netflix series
"Hon hon!"  - Mbappé, 2023
NICE
I adore the Mbappe-Haaland dynamic. This season's gonna be fire 🔥
It is like haaland to go missing… at least in the semis 😂
Better episode of the season till now, but seriously you put in Leao and not Kvara and Osimhen? Come on guys, you're really american
Petition to make this an actual show on Netflix
HERO BALL 🏀 VS HOUSE OF CHAMPIONS ⚽️   MJ Vs LBJ or MESSI VS RONALDO
That Murgh by Haaland 😂
Messi being over everyone's BS warms my heart. you've earned it, Leo.    edit: lmao ronaldo's toxic fans truly have earned their cameo in episode 2. yall need to go outside
Messi quite literally not giving a single fuck about anything after winning the World Cup is the best thing so far this season
Best Series On The Internet.
4:32 LMAO🤣🤣🤣
I wonder what Vini jr has to say about not being in the fight for the next goat
“How bout you treat this like the French squad and stay out of it.” Lol ouch
Happy ending for Messi 😱🙏
"It's Newcastle all over again" ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Nooo it's already over😭
Alright just bring back ronaldo and messi full time without them its trash
PEP SAID IM NOT ALLOWED TO WONDER 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why tf did Benzema pull out the Valbuena sextape???🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭☠️☠️☠️☠️
What about Saudi Edition ?
But these series are the best I wish we had these in our childhood instead of Dora the explorer😂😂❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The valbuena tape had me dying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's Newcastle all over again
😅😅😅 i watch this for the easter eggs and attention to detail
I RUSHED INTO THIS SERIES AND IT IS GETTING EPIC🤯‼️
Put some respect on Toulouse, we won the French Cup
Is it just me or i need Cristiano and Messi ramos naymar back in tjis season
2:50 top 3 best jokes in Champions
Football to Soccer just Messi Things

The person who came up with the original idea of the champions is worthy of my respect
Oh no 😢
I don't know.... but u feel the next generation won't be as fun as the old champions
Valbuena sextape seriously 😂
The fall off is crazy
Am just gonna stick to tap ins had me on the floor 😂😂
Cool intro! Very serious.. Eh,
Kane:"its Newcasttle again" 🤣🤣
Just finished episode 1 and 2 here we go episode 3
Benzema taking out the wrong tape is just too funny.😂
Mané😂

Manes punch 😂 4:40
Mbappe, treat this like the France squad and stay out! haha
Messi not caring about the plot against him and Karim's blackmail tapes.. man I love this series..❤❤
Messi is just accepting mbappés plan
wheres rashy
Mbappe being touchy w guys... I wonder what that could be referring to 😕
Early

This is too good 😫
They change football 180 degrees 😂
Not to worry lads , Super Frank can fix this! [flobs] 😂😂😂

Haaland is too nice XD
What a episode well done br/football
This season is looking amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Yooo that black mail tape 😂
Hello
Wow
The way haaland said but we are rivals until psg win the champions league
I feel that the Haaland-Mbappe rivalry is forced by the media to make up the goat rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo
the only bad thing about these is that is to short
fire season
Haaland and mbappe super gay moment
This season is shaping up to be historic
3 min ❤❤❤❤❤
