In addition to the splendid transformations, the hidden surprises and skills in the game also fill me with joy.
Only one day left, now, until the release date of this game!
So basically just Cutie Honey but with Nintendo flair
Princess peach the dancing queen😁
Entra no please and Project tentando please and Project Play Time Anitta no Switch please Nintendo no Play Time Taylor Swift
yo he jugado a la demo!!esta muy chulo!!si quieres ver la partida en MARCOSGAMERUNICO lo puedes ver subido!
I adore the various transformations that Peach undergoes in this game, as each one is distinct. My preferred transformations for Peach would be the Ninja, Swordfighter, and Kung Fu Peach.
This is The first game I am going to play as Princess Peach. I usually play as Mario and Yoshi .
I wanted to see peach cowgirl use a revolver🤠🤠🤠
I’m excited about this game coming out on the penultimate Friday of March this year (22nd) - the long awaited sequel to the (released in 2005 post-August but pre-December) Nintendo DS video game ‘Super Princess Peach’ (and especially better that *she’s* the playable protagonist, not those cliched, tiresome, overrated Italian plumber brothers) [hence additionally includes Luigi, not just Mario]. Heck, she was brave, back in said game, to have gotten through the five stages of World 4 - Fury Volcano (in that each stage - be it odd or even numbered, plays music that, IMO, scares me) [needless to say, I mean *both* music tracks - the one for the odd numbered stages, and for the even numbered stages]. Those stages were much better for her to have experienced, than the plumbers (especially the cowardly Luigi).
The ninja peach is my favorite because it looks epic as heck🤘
Princess Peach is even more badass now that her new game is about to be released.
Peach in Super Mario Bros: damsel in distress Peach in Super Smash Bros: I mean she can fight… Peach in Princess Peach Showtime: What!?  We need a Super Smash Bros update with Peach and these new abilities.
cannot express how much I love this direction for Peach. All the outfits are gorgeous!
Does it have multiplayer
Ngl, looks pretty good. Might check out on release. Love the detective fit 👌🔥
I can't wait to get and play Princess Peach Showtime when the game releases next month
Anyone planning a walk through of the game? Heh-he! 😁
Hm, how many Acts are these Trailers going to get?
Me gusta la Peach ninja y la kung fu xd
This looks stupid but I can't wait to see dashie play it
It’s Detective Peachachu! ❤❤❤
Ninja zelda basically shiek version of mario.....without hiding the identity....
They might as well make her a lawyer!
One month before release and I still have no idea what kind of game this will be. Is it a 3d-action-adventure? A minigame collection? Are there worlds to run from left to right? Do you have to switch between the costumes freely to look for stuff like metroidvania? Everything looks so "unpolished" and "unconnected" as it is a game with small mini-dungeon like levels. I don't know what to think about it but I'm still curious to see the end-product. Pre-paid is impossible for sure because of all the unknown stuff.
Man if there every make a new Smash. Peach will be broken.
Parece tão interessante quanto uma pêra. Espero que seja bom.
Those are pretty cool with Peach and those transformations. 🥷⚔🎂🤠🕵‍♀🎍
I think Patissiere Peach is my favorite transformation so far because it reminds me of an old Nintendo game called "Yoshi's Cookie."
Does anyone know the voice actor of peach, she sounds different than the others
i don't know how i feel about Peach sounding like a person after 20+ years of.... whatever her voice was
she's just like me for real
0:17 Actually acknowledging that Peach likes to drink ?
Sheik just called, he wants his androgynous ninja costume back.
30fps huh
Imagine that in smash 6 they redo peach moveset with the moves in this game. While daisy keps Peaches original moves but more tomboyish style.
Cool
Ninja Peach's gameplay reminds me a lot of Capcom's Megaman X/Zero/ZX
Lyah/Solar fits in with the uniforms
I’m getting it takes two without the multiplayer. The mechanics and even genre of the game will change level to level. That’s such an awesome idea and I can’t think of any other game to compare it to
I love this song!! 1:01
I love the Kung Fu Peach song!
Peach can literally become whatever she wants !! 0-0
This looks-a so cool. ^^
I am so freaking excited for this!
FUN FACT:  Princess Peach Showtime is the third Nintendo title powered by Unreal Engine 4!
Ninja peach is just kat & ana's mom
Now we need Princess Daisy: Showtime! and maybe a Waluigi game.
300 reais nesse lixo? mas nem fodendo kkkkk
She don't need saving annnnnymoooore
Hmm, a lot of combat based ones this reveal. Not bad, but I hope we get more like the patisserie. Maybe rock star, gymnast, farmer, something like that?
Peach on cowgirl...
This game 🎮 look good 👍💖
Waiting for this one 👸
I LOVE THE COWGIRL PEEEEAAACCCHH 🍑👑🤠
Detective Peach is one of the greatest waifus of all time.
Giving me Ape Escape 3 vibes and that's not a bad thing.
Peach is baker, sherlock holmes, napoleon heck a ninja too 💀💀💀
This looks so random and amazing 🙌🏼💖
Girls time is finally coming ♡...♡
Ninja Peach dons a black shirt, black thick pants, black long fingerless gloves, a long green scarf or face covering with gold details, green belt with a blue jewel in the center, black two toed socks and dark red sandals. Actually, She does not wear a mask over her nose or mouth in her own form.
Ninja peach vs sheik 👀
I like how Peach says "hum-chaa" when transforming into swordfighter peach just like with the attack in smash bros.
can't wait NOT to play this.
Love it! I just hope that there are even more costumes, and that the game isn't TOO easy.
Got any more transformations?
She is the only one true princess❤
:D
Another main character Nintendo game to add to my collection of mario and lugi titles! Super pumped for this game!❤
did anyone notice how they're giving peach a new moveset for any nintendo related fighting games in the future?
So Peach is one of those Nintendo Ninjas everyone talks about? 😮
One of those concepts that makes you go "why haven't there been at least 1 of these on store shelves every 3 years for the past 25?"
Yo that Mario Party 2 remake looking 🔥🔥🔥
I was wondering if Mario would become a ninja too.
Princess Peach has a second game lol😂😂😂
Luce fabulosa
I hope we get like a super dress or something besides baker :(
Peach is starting to act like her movie counterpart!
THEY MADE CLOVER INTO A COSTUME!!! (Joking, I know the costume is original to the game)
Peach cosplaying in all these different ways is so precious. 💜 It's so nice to see her get her own game (that's not in poor taste).
Yo why this game lowkey look kinda fire like they didn’t need to go this hard for a peach game 🔥
She wasnt kidding when she said she was going on vacation
This game gives me Kirby vibes
This game gonna be bored like Yoshi crafted World
Pass
I'm really happy that Princess Peach is left-handed / left-footed, now make Link lefty again!
This is SO AWESOME!!
It's about time Bowser finally kidnapped Mario and Peach got a new adventure 😅
oh my goodness she’s so cute :3
Peach is gonna be so OP in the next Smash installment.
0:44 Detective Peach’s run gets me every time
I’m gonna be so upset if they don’t make a demo for this game
Cowgirl Peach happens to be the most Tomboyish transformation, right to the hoop earrings.
The Barbie of Nintendo. Cool
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I've heard about this not a sequel but looks like areal show stopper definitely A buy from me.
Never thought I would say this.. but I love princess peach
That does it, I gonna go play Ape Escape 3 right now.
Normal/Princess- Platformer  Swordfighter, Ninja, Kung Fu- Action/Platformer  Cowgirl, Patisserie, Detective- Minigames
Hopefully this will stop the complaining by the people who are upset by her only having one game, and hopefully this is mainline Peach who is nicer/non-mary sue compared to movie peach and despite Odyssey's ending. Still, Paper Peach is probably the best version.
Princess Peach Showtime is Another Nintendo Ninja Peach Voice Of Samantha Kelly! Princess Peach Showtime is coming game! New transformation  Ninja Peach 0:05 0:06  Cowgirl Peach 0:15 0:18 Swordfighter Peach 0:28 Detective Peach 0:38 Patisserie Peach 0:49 0:52 Kung Fu Peach 1:02 1:04  1:12
Peachy is so cute in those outfits!! And it sounds like she has a new voice to boot. Love it!! Peach being a badass is always grand to see.
All i know is that 2024 and beyind the cosplays are going to be wild.
Giving Hat in Time vibes
I don't know if this is just me, but all of the peach costumes is telling me they don't know what direction to take this game and they are letting you decide for yourself, maybe I am just reading into this too much but I feel like this game has no soul
Pokémon trainer Peach?
Ninja, Kung Fu, and Swordfighter Peach were my favorite it was nice to see Peach tap into her fighting prowess again
Ninja Peach amiibo!!!!
Next up: DLC collaboration w/Square to add Dressphere Peach that looks like FFX-2 Yuna and dual-wields. ;)
R34: Woo Yeah Baby! That's What I've Been Waiting For!
No wizard peach!?
Seems like ninja and Kung fu would be the same category.
Why did Mario have to save her again?
Cowgirl peach. If you know you know
I think this forced them to be very creative and, it looks REALLY fun.  Omg, this looks really awesome. I really liked that  Elegant style gameplay? Suitable for kids but still interesting? And the artstyle, and the portraying of her as both still princess peach but something that empowers women to break the social codes.. I really like how it turned out!
I haven’t had the chance to play palworld yet but I still encourage anyone who can play it too get it.  Why? Because Nintendo can’t keep releasing half finished games and expect too get away with it especially with Pokémon. With REAL competition Nintendo will be forced to put effort into the games they make.
Princess Preach is finally getting her showtime (iykyk, typo intentional)
Gonna be weird to tell your friend you want the new princess peach game but yeah this is fire 🔥 🔥🔥
Peach: Why Nintendo Didn't Remake This Game Like Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time on Nintendo Switch, Because, I Want to Meet My Baby Self, Because, I Just Want to Learn How to Be a Mommy
This is a small detail, but I love that Peach's outfits aren't pink (granted, Patisserie Peach has a pink scarf, but it's subtle).
AWW PEACH IS SO CUTE!  PLEASE MAKS SOME PRINCESS PEACH SHOWTIME PLUSHIES GANE-ACCURATE TO PRINCESS PEACH!
So Peach is a Warrior of Light
Lots of the Nintendo character outfits will be recycled for more of them.
If Daisy and Luigi got more famous, they can have games for themselves like Luigi's Mansion and New Super Luigi U.
Consider this the ultimate fashion show for Mario's lover. It's a lark fun rendition of Super Princess Peach.
00:20
Man my baby girl peach has different personality when she change costume cool can wait👍
Ninja peach is something I never knew I wanted, but it's an awesome idea, now I want the same for all Mario characters
Has Peach ever thought about getting into the theater business? She can definitely get into character with whatever role she plays!
OMG, Cowgirl Peach is another cosplay I'm gonna try!
A cow girl without a gun....yep
This game is actually has the same date as my sister birthdays which is pretty sweet.
Hey Nintendo I need some help so the Mario galaxy logo theres a secret a need answers
One thing for sure is that Peach is going to have an interesting new move set in the next Super Smash Bros. game!
Give us a better cheaper pokemon game
Is this Dee from it’s always sunny in Philadelphia
Did peach get a new voice actor, or are these just new clips?
Peach really eating up these looks
I can already see these in the next smash bros game
Literal goosebumps screaming with joy with collapsed rectum
Peaches Peaches Peaches I love you!
she is an icon, a queen, a girlboss, and she is the moment ✨I can't wait for this game!
This feels like A Hat In Time
GAME OF THE YEAR 2024 can’t say more
This is giving me Ape Escape Vibes....
If she's this awesome, how did Bowser capture her so many times?
They running out of ideas
Looks like Americans took over Nintendo
👎👎
Do we get to see her in her dressing room too?
Aha! I always knew that Peach stood with Bowser by choice she never needed Mario
This game looks fun it would be cool if all her outfits were pink I mean there's no reason she can't have a pink trenchcoat I dress in more pink than a fictional princess
why is her voice different?
I really love how each character is getting a advanced graphics 3D version of games on the switch for themselves so far. Odyssey was for Mario, Luigis mansion 3 was for Luigis, and now this for Peach. So excited 😭
Best game ever
Which one will have the most rule 34? My bet is on the cowgirl.
where’s gun peach
0:08 That Peach reminds me of the clothes of Joseph Joestar from JoJo Bizarre Adventure.
😍
Did Peach have a new VA?
Now Peach herself has become the next face of Nintendo
Rule 34
swordfighter peach? nah that's clearly Musketeer Peach.
So is this a mini-game collection? I’m still confused as to what this even is
Is it me or is her voice different???
This makes me so happy
💞💞💞🎉👋
R34 gon' go crazy
Princess Peach as the Ninja that's awesome
This looks so bad 😕
I don't usually play Mario related games, but this looks fire! I love her different outfits and powers, and it's so colorful!
The Detective Peach segments will be better than all of Detective Pikachu Returns combined.
anti-aliasing: off
🥵
Peach and all her costumes in this video game remind me of Sora and all his Keyblades in Kingdom hearts.
looking kinda like odessy  kinda cool
Since even peach got her game, can we give some love to waluigi too?
2 questions: 1) How many transformations is Princess Peach gonna have in this game? 2) What's gonna be the difference between Ninja and Kung Fu Peach?  Lots of things about both seem pretty much the same.
better renew my faith on games about getting costumes
Give us samba Peach
pls nintendo make peach in a cooking mama dress
yeah i’m getting this idgaf!!!!
PEACH DRINKS BEER?
CHANGE PEACH'S VOICE BACK!!!
Peach better not get kidnap anymore 😂😂😂😂
First Sword 🗡️ Fighter, 🍪 Patissiere 🧁, 📚 Detective 🔎, And 🔥 Kung Fu 🐉. And 🥳 Now 🏯 Ninja ⛩️ and 🐮 Cowgirl! 💕 Right Again Nintendo 🎮 Company, 🥳 You Are the Best! 🎉 I'm Going to Get That New 🥳 Video 🎮 Game on My 🎂 Birthday 🎈 Soon! 🎁
OMG Peach is so cute. Love the outfits.
really hope the controls will be good and not as clunky as Kirby's dream buffet
finally a fashion related style with peach i hope they add in dlc for new characters to add in such as daisy
You know some sad 40 yr old neck beard is praising Nintendo for this Peach video game lmao
Even though I'm not super interested in this it will be nice seeing peach get some love. Also could see some transformations in a newer smash which is neat.
is not her voice😿
Does she get the abilities like Kirby or what
So good to see Peach having an actual personality 😭
As a pastry chef in training, I'm so FREAKING EXCITED
This is the second time Peach gets her own game
my mig switch is ready 😂😂😂
Amazing I love it 💕
Cant wait for goomba’s solo game!
Detective Peachaku
I really hope Peach gets to wear a hula dancer outfit, and besides... I'm Hawaiian myself, and I am so excited for this game to come out.
Detective peachachu
if there’s no super princess peach (DS) references in this game im gonna cry
I'll get this game.🤩
This is something I crave more than any Super Mario game ever released since Super Mario 64. It looks fantastic. If this fulfill the expectations, I think Peach will have her own saga for many years to come.
I much rather the return of the parasol then this
Ninja peach is clearly going to be good in the next smash bros.  Gonna use the heck out of her
Sorry but Mario is in another Theater
Excited for this game, hope it rules!
Live a live, but if everyone was peach
Wait is that her new voice
Game looks incredible I just miss peach old voice
Oh so she’s Cutie Honey?
Well this comment stay up if I say ninja peach sounds kinda like.............never mind lol
Peach aka Nintendo Barbie lol
Cowgirl Peach? Looks like someone has yeed their last haw.
This Peach transformation as a new character in a new Smash game will be wild!
Looks like garbage
If more characters were getting added to Smash, I'm sure people would try to ask for characters from this game, and claim Peach and Daisy aren't Mario characters.
Hope she has these outfits and power in next Super Smash Bros.
her voice...
Could have been a somewhat decent game - but it forces a female character to be protagonist just to please that small niche group of clowns.
Kind of reminds me of wario world for some reason
I miss her old voice though.
Well now we know what her smash 6 moveset is gonna be based off
0:46 cute little yellow guys :)
I like how this game is letting Peach take on different roles and has Peach do different tasks based on these roles! It shows that people can do anything they put their mind to!
Ok now I want a daisy game next
This honestly looks like it could be the next Luigi's Mansion
Does she actually get a transformation sequence for each one? (like Sailor Moon?)
This actucally looks pretty good
Takarazuka Peach
Well at least we finally get to see peach actually bake a cake
😊🤩esta Genial sus nuevos poderes y trajes sinduda el shouw sera incleible!!!!!!
Her voice has changed...
I hope they don’t show off every tranformation
So excited for this!!!
When mfs forget Peach had a game of her own on the DS.
I hope there's a reference to Super Princess Peach in this game. My childhood would be complete if there was.
Idk if it’s just me but does her voice sound a bit off?
She's not insufferable in this game is in the Mario movie right?
The girls are winning
The day Nintendo copied Barbie...
So, Mario has been around for years as do Peach, but Mario has had many games and does the same ol’ jumping and squishing turtles and goombas. Whereas Peach only has two games focusing on her and this newest one gives her many skills and combat abilities compare to Mario, who only jumps and can’t do anything else. SMH Not that i am complaining since she’s my favorite from all the Mario games.
Think about it if mkt wasn’t done some of these could have been added to it
Nintendo really went:       PEACHES, PEACHES, PEACHES, PEACHES, PEACHES 🍑
This is a bit of a crazy and weird idea, but i would like if there was a transformation where peach has elastic powers. It could be called rubberband peach or something like that. With the transformation, she can use her elasticity to reach new heights by changing her legs into a spring like structure, and squeeze through tight spaces to find secrets and progress through levels.
really excited for this game, almost all the characters have their own game, i hope nintendo release a daisy or waluigi game
This is actually a charming idea
How much yall wanna bet there's gonna be DLC with more transformations?
Nice!!
Delicious. Finally, some good food.
Now Francine also has personas, like Roger.
Hitman peach?
Bayonetta peach ?
Cowabunga! you had me at Ninja Peach! 🐢🍕👍
Wow they made a strong woman in a videogame without having to tell us shes a strong woman in a videogame   Do they just make it easy or was it always this simple?
I cannot express how much I love this direction for Peach. All the outfits are gorgeous!
I never thought Wario: Master of Disguise would get a sequel, but here we are, wow!
Seems neat! Its got cutie honey vibes
Peach became the modern barbie
I like how basically none of her outfits are pink
Im looking forward to play this on the 22nd of March
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
I’m so excited for this game!!
Will these also be available as DLC for Super Smash Bros?
Will these be also be available as dlc in super smash Bros?
These are all masculine roles while Peach is the princess and was feminine in the past like in Super Mario Sunshine or in Melee, fighting but still in a dress. This is just gender swapping other generic games.
It’s like a split personality disorder I like it it’s very fun tosee
NARUTO X PEACH YEHAHAHAAAAA
2024 is going to be another Nintendo year!
I feel so happy that Peach has a solo game again, the game looks beautiful, and honestly I never expected these transformations!
Can’t wait to play the game. I do hope the toads will pop up in the game here and there
I want the game, but I'm afraid it's just going to be a Warioware/Mario Party mini game. They have shown multiple costumes, but no complete levels. I feel like she's going to drop on stage, get a costume, and play a mini game to complete the level.
ehi, the musics sound like Zelda games from the past 😍
Mario 64 was such a landmark game. I feel like a side game could be made in its engine to follow up on that game. I think the style is as iconic as the 8 bit version of Mario. Charging 5 Bucs for a series of sectioned content would be pretty cool. Or for that matter on nso.
I would die for cowgirl Peach
Peach pastelera puede hornear unos momazos :v
Come on, Nintendo. Just give me a Hawaiian hula dancing outfit and a beach stage for god's sake!
Princess Pitch!
Honestly I saw the thumbnail and my gut reaction was just:  "I hope they give Peach a gun"
How bowser can caught this girl ✋🏾
Mmh, looks simply like a collection of minigames. I hope that this will not be the case
Im gonna be so annoying when this comes out
This just doesn't look all that fun to me. Not to rain on anyone's parade but is this just a bunch of minigames? And it's very strange to me that there's not a single negative comment here. The nintenbots are REAL
Need an Amy Rose game
This game is adorable, but anyone else still struggling to understand what it actually... is gameplay wise?
I love the idea of a Peach game and more characters getting more spotlight, but I dont think its gonna have good sales. It seems very half done, Not marketed well, and a tad bit confusing. I feel like its a guinea pig to exploring the other Mario Characters, but they should have given it more love to get a better result.
This looks like a Barbie game but actually good.
Shantae
While I'm not the biggest peach fan, I'm genuinely interested in what this will bring, might get the game to see if it lives up to what I think
Ugh, I can't wait for this to come out! It looks so good!
Of all her costumes, I love sword-fighter best. It maintains her frilly flair in a fitting way.
And people wanna say she has no personality lol. I'm so glad Peach finally gets another game! Hopefully Daisy gets one too but that's probably not likely.
Super princess peach plus wario master of disguise an odd combo but sure ,seens good
I saw the ninja costume and immediately thought it was from Ninja Gaiden for some reason.
Nobody wants to admit this is just a Kirby game that features Peach instead of Kirby.
Gotta wait till March 💔
Why does it look janky tho
With a title like "Showtime!", she better get a giant robot form. Right?
did peach get a new VA?
Cowboy peach can fix me ngl
Can’t wait to play it!!
Finally a Mario game that’s interesting again!
Peach becoming a waifu material
Looks like fun can't wait!
I'm glad they went for the voice direction they did in this game. It matches her attitude here, and it's like Peach has gone back to her Super Mario 64-self, how she always should've sounded
Peach is going to be nuts in the next Smash.
Dayum peach. Dayum. 🍑
I'm so excited for the game. I preordered the second they were available. Also, Nintendo please make figures of all of her outfits I will buy
Peach is a barbie girl now...  This game looks interesting
So looking forward to it! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Does anyone notice that peach has a different voice?
dunno how i feel bout the voice actress
It’ll be nice if Daisy team up together with Peach
Nintendo your so cool
This game is going to be fun!
Should've gotten a peach game of her commanding her armies of toads to fight Koopa troopas
I really like how different this game is. No typical "Mario" elements anywhere and gives Peach her own universe.
Not peach👎
I love peach even more
I can't wait to get this game soon for my Switch once it's finally available and I'm also really glad Peach is getting her own game again too!
Those are a lot of male roles all girls suddenly love
uh ok i guess? =/
Definitely picking this one up.
i wish all her outfits were pink
Definitely getting it, since it's coming out on my birthday!
The Village People as portrayed by Peach.
Sick
Am I the only one that thinks her voice is different?
Smash, smash, smash, smash, smash and uhhh yes for the love the peachs peachs SMASH!
Is it just me or does peach have a different voice here?
This is racist! I will not stand for white people appropriating Asian culture in order to make more money!
So cool to see Princess Peach getting such an action-packed game. 🎮🍑
*_Detective Peach-achu!_* 😁
Reminds me of a much better game on the PS3 called Puppeteer.
This gives peach so much potential for reimagining in Smash.  Now watch how they don't use ANY of it in the next title.
So her controls change with each costume?   It's just Kirby-
Anyone noticed Peach’s new voice?
Ninja y Kung Fu Peach ya hace referencia a la Peach de la película xD
W Patissiere Peach, only one that makes sense, should be the only one.  Do you understand?
I LOVE HER
So it’s basically Kirby
That was a great trailer! Also I know that Princess peaches voices different than it was before.
YAAASSS WE SLAY TODAY GURL 💅💅💅❤️💯
I'm actually really excited to see how this game's going to play out, because some looks like mini games, other bits look like battles and then there's platforming and it's just INSANE! I'm so glad Peach is getting her own game! ✨
PS1 GRAPHICS
This is awesome I hope we learn more about Grape and the sour bunch in the next trailer
Searching Cowgirl Peach on Google Images is crazy
YES THIS IS PERFECT I CAN NOT WAIT!  I hope Nintendo keeps going this way by giving Daisy and Waluigi their own unique games. I just LOVE how fresh Princess Peach Showtime is. I know they can do amazing vibes for both Daisy and Waluigi, please Nintendo don’t sleep on them we love them.
Peach is a total badass in this game 😎
The voice sounds a little low pitch for Peach, I hope they pitch it up a tad for the final game!
All these costumes reminds me of the dress spheres on Final Fantasy  X-2. Is Peach one of the Gullwings?
Y'all better not Let this game flop, come on now she SERVING
I hope more transformations will be released in either a future Nintendo direct or a future trailer
looks lame
This is looking SO COOL. I really love the variety of outfits and styles of gameplay this is going to bring! My only worry is that the game will stretch itself too thin with 6 different gameplay styles, but I think it should actually make it more fun to see the large variety of ideas come together. Can't wait to play it!
I don’t like the voice
Where is the demo?
Who’s going to get this game?
Better than Wario In Master ‘0 Disguise Princess Peach’s Going To Be The Replacement’0 Disguise!
Wierd concept
Palworld solos ur entire company😎
Peach's voice sounds different
They're really justifying her new move set in the next smash game.
peach W
Looks good for introducing someone to video games for the first time
Anyone notice that Peach’s voice sounds…….weird?
Fun fact! The ninja peach is to represent the Nintendo ninjas when you pirate a Nintendo game!
Is this transition peach? Where is the princess part in this? She needs logistics and master plan at becoming the Queen of the toadstools by dumping Mario and wage war at the neighboring fungus kingdoms.🌈🐒🔫
All of princess peach her transformations they are so cool and awesome 😎 play peach her transformations abilities.
This is cool, she's on more exciting adventures!
If the areas are well-crafted, this might be better than Luigi's Mansion 3.
Peach genji and peach cassidy
0:18 Howdy! 🤠
r34 is ready!
I’ve got to get this!
the smash bros line up is crazy
Her voice sounds a little different than I'm used to. I'm also lamenting the lack of lines of dialogue. I do like that the stages seem to feature some more expansiveness than just the theater areas, though Still, fun video! Thanks for uploading!
No Onlyfans peach? Its 2024 nintendo!
Yooo peach's throwing hands Pog
Hard pass.
I am surprisingly excited for this. This game looks like it could be great fun.
Peach is a strong woman
As a lady plumber myself, I think it would have been really apt to see Plumber Peach considering her connection to Mario (despite him never really doing any plumbing haha)
Lots of new Mario power-ups
Wow, Peach gets her own stand alone adventure aaaaand its a damn play. Lol yup that fits, it's a lot more than what Waluigi ever got. Waaaaaa!
Before I even opened the video I had a pretty good idea of what the attacker would look like 🤣
What’s the plot though?
Wait a second, it's me or Princess Peach's voice sounds different in this game 🤔 listen carefully 🎙️🔈🔉🔊👂🎧
Princess Peach: Showtime! Dress for success! 😉👍🏾
Smash Modders are going to have a field day with all the different costumes
I love Cowgirl Peach. 🥰
0:05 1. Ninja Peach 0:16 2. Cowgirl Peach 0:28 3. Swordfighter Peach 0:39 4. Detective Peach 0:50 5. Patissiere Peach 1:01 6. Kung Fu Peach
Super yne meillieur suite d'un jeux deja super
This. Is a mistake
Great to see peach get another game AND with a great thematic and mechanics
:/
Imagine if we get a Genie Peach. Crossover with Shantae maybe?
This doesn't look like itll be fun. I'm excited for a Peach game, but even with Transformations, they all seem very limited in scope and the gameplay doesn't look to be too engaging. Hopefully I'm wrong though
As a hardcore PC and Xbox gamer I'm infatuated with this cutie. 🥰 I've already ordered a Switch and I can't wait to play as her. 🤩
We makin it out the Mushroom Kingdom with this
Now Peach you have no excuse to ever be kidnapped again. You are so capable with all these abilities.
1:12 Peach Musketeer got some beautiful curves
I'm looking forward to this i really hope it doesn't suck.
*Princess Peach: Show Time! – Transformation Trailer – Nintendo Switch
i dont like the voice direction
So why does Mario have to save her from Bowser now? Is it all, JUST A GAME!?!?
Why did she hold the sword in her left hand, but the other items in her right?
Will Daisy, Rosalina and Pauline be in The Game and be Playable too?
please change the box art from movie peach to just peach you won’t regret it
it's looking like a mix of 3d world and luigi's mansion kinda
Remember that one joke in Princess Peach for 2DS/3DS?
Ninja Peach's scarf looks oddly familiar...    But something tells me she already knew that was the next thing I'll say.
Peach in the guise of innovation will definitely appeal to everyone 😊 .
I don't understand the direction of this game and how it all ties together.
So… it’s Barbie but it’s peach.
I’m so glad peach is getting her own game again! I enjoyed playing super princess peach on my 3DS and I can’t wait til this comes out.
Guess we’re not getting a Direct next month. Maybe the rumors about a new console this year are true.
Peach is making her Off-Broadway debut with a one-woman show.
The next one needs to be an open world adventure. This looks like the fun will end within 5 minutes of each level.
Super cute!
i already pre ordered the game but its awesome to see more outfits added like the cowgirl and ninja can´t wait for the game that comes out on my birthday
peach is gonna go absolutely crazy in smash bros 6
If Peach doesn't get some new moves from this game in the next Smash Bros.....
MOTHER IS MOTHERING
Peach confirmed ambidextrous?
Can we get Amiibos of all these costumes please?😂
Imagine if we combine kirby, detective pickachu and Kung fu panda 🤔😐
This looks so freaking good..
I have a feeling a certain Deviant Artist and Youtuber is going to have a field day with this.
Cowgirl Peach, ey? 😏
I wonder if any of these new looks could be an alternative costume for the princess in Super Smash Bros.?   Or better yet, one of these could be her new Final Smash.
We need a Pg-13 or up Princess Daisy game about why she is never in anything
Is it just me or is her voice different? Maybe her voice actor changed? Or with this game she is emoting more to whatever outfit she changes so it sounds different.
Nintendo you mean: Waluigi showtime
They went with "swordfighter" but "patisserie" was simple enough?
I guess? Imma go play more palworld until Nintendo decides to make better games
I got to give respect to Samantha Kelly, it's kind of cool how she gets to change her voice and tone whenever Peach wears a different outfit. It's not what I expected, but it's an interesting direction to take this character.
Ever years it's becoming more and more kid friendly liek 5 years Olds lol
My Body is Ready for All the Different Styles of Peach
Sakurai take notes
New voice actor?!
It looks fun. I just cannot convince my awkward 11 year old son that playing a 'girl game' would be fun 😂 My daughter will probably be the catalyst in how I get this in my house. 😏
Wow!  That's quite a number of Transformations!  Cowgirl Peach reminds me of Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl from the Toy Story Franchise!
SHE TALKS MY GOD
Welcome back, Balan Wonderworld
Sad it's only 6, but game looks awesome and I'm hyped. As someone, who always picks luigi and yoshi (and dry bones and blooper if they are in the game!), I never expected a Princess Peach game nor I thought it would be fun, but that can be actually great and I'm crossing fingers it will be a hit and get more titles in future.
0:34 GIRL, YOU BETTER LEAVE THAT PECHARUNT ALONE!
GYATTTT
this game looks awesome, we need more games starring another mario characters (like bowser, daisy, waluigi, etc.)
Peach's voice sounds a bit deeper here, but she is still extremely cute.
Did theu change the voice for Peach?
Would be nice if there were more traditionally feminine roles other than just pastry chef.
キュートな ピーチ姫 いやされるなあー( ´∀`)
I hope there's a Daisy DLC.
Wow, loving this so far! Also is it just me or has Peach’s voice gone a bit deeper? She sounds a little different here.
Am I insane. What is happening. This game makes no sense to me is it like a bunch of Mario party mini games or something like what is the point of this gameplay.
So Peach is Cutey Honey now? Neat, I'm on board.
Finally! A Princess Peach game! I can't wait for its release.
I like swordfighter peach
If there was a Mario version of this game, it would be awesome.
I noticed in the first trailer there are 10 posters on the theater, which could mean that there are 10 plays and most likely 10 transformations. So far, we've seen six transformations: swordfighter, detective, patissiere, kung fu, ninja, and cowgirl. If there are four more of them, I'm looking forward to see what they might be.
This isnt Princess Peach. Why do they have to turn every female character in to a feminist stereotype.
Even peach got her own game What about waluigi???
I loved his ninja look🤤🫂❣️
She is more man than that wimpy little Mario
I thought they changed her face to make her look like the movie version?
Looking forward to this game! I’d love to see an amiibo or two of her outfits but I don’t know how likely that is. Definitely gonna get the new pink joycons though!
I wish I had the money to buy a switch.
This video made me realize that Peach has a whole fandom looking out for her and it makes me happy :)
So this is what Sheik taught Peach in that airship..  (If you know you know)
Thank goodness she hasn't been bullied into getting race swapped yet.
When you are a master swordfighter, a adept shinobi, as well as a master kung fu artist but still can't prevent a slightly large turtle from kidnapping you.
Nintendo could mever decide for a gameplay hook for a peach game, so this is pretty brilliant.  But why does it have that sterile look many Nintendo games have these days? Where is the SOUL?
Princess Peach likes playing dress up
What an entertaining transformation❣️🍑
Detective Peachachu! Sword fighter peach x super smash brothers? (Costumes).  Dear Mario: Please come to the  castle. I’ve baked a cake for you. Yours truly  Princess Toadstool  Ninja Peach!
Finally the Damsel in Distress is getting the attention she deserves  and getting a NEW game we all wanted since Super Princess Peach.
I cannot wait!
Cowgirl peach 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This one goes out to all the girls that grew up with Peach being the damsel in distress and disliked the helpless role that she always had. FINALLY!!
Okay but, the Cowgirl Peach & Swordfighter Peach... Nintendo knows exactly what they're doing~
Peach is into roleplay
Is this a bunch of mini-games? :/
Peach's voice sounds kind of different and i can't quite put my finger on why.
If we're lucky, they'll the theater to Nintendo World.
Peach is now a ninja... Someone pinch me
I find it cool how the horse from miitopia is in this lol
If this is an rpg kinda game could you imagime the potential??
0:18 SHE SPOKE! when was the last time you heard peach say something other than "mario"
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1:03 Super Mario Galaxy?
I'm still not sure what kind of game this is. I've seen some 3D Mario, some Mario Party, some RPG elements. Is it a platformer, action RPG, minigame collection?
Im so confused as to what type of game this is going to be. Is it a story mode? Or is it a bunch of minigames?
Oh yeah, Cowgirl Peach! It's going to be on top, that's the position.
Hopefully there is more than those 6 transformations
Now just add in a final boss that makes use of every single one of these abilities and you got a banger.
WILL THERE IS AN ONLY FANS PEACH?
Why am I getting strong “Kirby” vibes from this game?
Am I the only one that noticed Princess Peach voice sound different nown
I'm really hoping we get more Peach games. Odyssey sequel starring Peach and Tiara maybe? She's a fun character design.
Looks great. But this is a game for girls?
Kinda weird hearing game Peach sound like a human person. lol
The music reminds me of Galaxy it sounds so cool! This game is looking amazing
Been playing sooo much Palworld. 😏
OH MY GOD! I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!!!
But... what's the point?
Eww that does not sound like Peach 😭😭
Next Smash Bros will have half the roster as Peach variants.
I am a man in my his twenties, and you know I’m about to 100% this game
Unpredicting that they're going to show Archer peach🏹
I hope Nintendo don't Change de Voice of her.
why do i get the feeling this game will flop
The ninja theme slaps so hard
I think I’ll get it for Easter.
Yeah this actually looks pretty good.
This game looks so good! I know the costumes are gonna be out of this world for many cosplayers :)
I like Swordfighter Peach (because swords are cool!🗡), Ninja Peach (because ninjas are cool🥷🏼), Cowgirl Peach (because she has a horse🐴) and Detective Peach (Sherlock Holmes vibes🔎) This Princess Peach Showtime game looks fun.
Uhh…did this game get enough time in the oven?
Peach looks so cute! I've always loved Peach and cant wait to play this game! Yay! 🍑 😊
Cowgirl Peach is similar to that of Jessie who yodels and rides on Bullseye the horse at the Old West in the Disney Pixar Toy Story series.
This game looks SO fun!
Want cow girl peach
I remember posting one of those "Corporate needs you to find the difference between this picture and this picture" but the pictures were Swordfighter Peach and that Maria lady from Bloodborne. I still stand by that meme. 😆
Are we not going to talk about her voice change, I’m not liking it it supposed to be little more higher pitch
Why she sound like 2 different are making her voice? (no hate, loved Super princess Peach and really hype about this one)
Interesting that Peach's sword hand is her left when it seems like everything else is done with her right. Not that I'm complaining! I'll take my south paw representation wherever i can get it!
I only just realised; in some ways, this is kind of a spiritual successor to Wario, Master of Disguise
This game has made me like peach as a character and its not even out yet
Oh my hod she looks amazing I still like swordfightet the most
well i know what im getting my niece for her bday
So last time, Bowser thought he was being smart by kidnapping Mario and Luigi.  Wonder what the idea is this time?
Only nit-pick I have is I wish they hadn't of changed her voice.
Let me guess for the next Mario kart game y’all gonna add these to a spin off Mario game. I see what your doing Nintendo ohhh yeah
costumes look great but it was kinda distracting how different her voice sounds.
Not sold Nintendo show us more.  Like an actual game play trailer?  Meanwhile, NO PRE-ORDER FOR YOU!
I don’t like her voice acting
WAIT FOR : -SUPER HERO PEACH -MERMAID PEACH -MAGICIAN PEACH  -DANCING PEACH
This is going to be SO amazing! I'm so glad that Peach is finally getting a cooler role in a game again. 🤩
It’s fabulous to see how far she’s come from a typical gaming damsel-in-distress to someone who knows how to hold her own. I’m looking forward to March 22nd.
The weird thing is peach voice changes on every costume except for patisserie peach and I saw another video and patisserie peach sounds like normally peach voice with another voice lines that’s weird!
See, Hollywood? This is how you give space and empower feminine characters, not creating a "Maria", but being original and creative.
she just like kirby fr
Very cute!
Peach's range of cool transformations is making me just SWOON - the cowgirl one especially's making me weak in the knees. This game's gonna be such a delight of a comeback for her since SPP.  Also it seems like her VA's showing bit more range with her voice in this game, kind of caught me off-guard.
Peaches can save herself DUHHHHHHHHH
As my daughter gets older I’m glad Nintendo has given her a good video game role model. But as an overgrown Nintendo fan I’m somewhat embarrassed by this title.
The ninja version is great for Peach, on the other hand they transform Mario and Luigi into elephants, lol xD
Yeah this system done. Lol.
Looks like Princess Peach has gone Naruto with that ninja outfit. Believe it!
Man, I'm so excited for this game. Also I noticed Peach's voice sounds different in this trailer. Not so high pitched. I think it suits her.
They finally realized Peach can do anything Barbie can
It's likely about time Peach stopped being a damsel in distress and became independent once more! I wish she could free herself from Bowser like that.
Strong independent princess who don't need no plumber
Amazing
So Excited for this game! ❤
It makes you wonder if Sakurai do make another Super Smash Brothers game will this be Peach New Move Set Mainly Sword Fighter Peach,Kung Fu Peach,Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach most likely 👍👍
Is this a balan wonderworld sequel?
Peach is like Mario your not the only one who has Multiple power ups and titles.
This is really nice but I pass. I don't want to see myself, an adult man, playing an e-doll.
Please release a demo, I want to support peach game but have no idea what this game is
When did peach become such a bad mofo. I aint complaining, it's high time she defends herself
The only power up that I've kinda Dissagree with is the Chef Peach because think about it she did Make a Cake for Mario in Super Mario 64 Ending and also in the first Paper Mario game she baked a Cake for the Fat Shy Guy Character even though those are 2 different Peaches but still.
Peach in Smash 6 is beginning to feel like it's going to be OP
Anyone else notice the voice change?
Someone will defently Create Ninja Peach in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate they already have the Peach Hair Styles and the Ninja Outfit for the Mii character's and the Captian Outfit.
This just makes the mainline Mario games even more of a stage play. Matpat is right. How is Peach captured so easily if she can be a martial arts master, cowgirl, fencer, etc. This just make regular old peach disappointing in the next smash.  Also, peach shooting goomba’s when? :p cowboy’s can revolvers. :p Also, of course she would be great with rope with how much she gets captured, probably gets tied up a lot.
I am so ready for this game🩷 my favorites are swordfighter and detective!
peach finally being the star of the show after 18 years since she was last the star
That voice 😔😔
I love this for Peach but why does she sound so weird? Anytime she talks she normally has her high-pitched voice but they didn't display that in this
Wow I'm actually surprised they used the term cowgirl and not cowperson! 😂😂😂
Me like this!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉❤❤❤
This truly looks fantastic, so happy to see the care and attention given to this character 🙏
And I still waiting for Luigi Mansion for GameCube remastered :(
GOTY 2024
New moveset for peach in the next smash game!!!
Absolute waifu material ❤😍😘🥰
❤
It has been confirmed that Samantha Kelly is still the voice of Princess Peach.  So admit it…I was right.😏
Can't wait to play it, it looks so fun. I hope many people get to enjoy this game
Her voice is a lot deeper. I’m guessing this is closer to how Samantha Kelly sounds in real life.
Girl Power
I thought they put a samurai because the cowboy and because well the people in Japan love cowboy and people in West love samurai.
I was looking forward to this game since I played a bunch of super princess peach on DS.. now I'm not so sure.. not what I was hoping for
I was ao excited that Peach was getting another game after nearly 20 years, but....  This looks incredibly boring. I also don't understand what type of game it is suppose to be because it looks like it is trying to do a little bit of everything.  I need to see more than costumes to know if it's even worth getting this. I'll probably just wait for reviews.
This is gay trash. Nintendo has gone woke.
I love these new costumes for princess peach, can't wait for nintendo to add them to mario kart tour... wait...
Does anybody else notice that the voice actress sounds... different?
Really can't believe the framerate is this bad.
👎👎
Why is this reading as “Princess Peach but Copy Abilities”?
Man...these Amiibo are gonna COOK
This is just awesome.  Also, does anyone notice Peach's voice? It sounds different.
Reminds of puppeteer on ps3
All I can think of is how badass Peach would be in a new Super Smash Bros. game now
This just reminds me of double soul or soul unison from the battle network games fsr
BEANS
BRAVO!!! 🤩  I’m so hyped for this game ! 😁
Arin is going to lose his mind! Next we need "Yoshi: Showtime!" for Dan.
The new peach in the new smash will be powerful 😵‍💫😵‍💫♥️♥️
Well at least this looks better than super princess peach
Looks like a collection of mini-games.
This is like Wario: Master of Disguise but with Peach instead.
Cowboy Peach is doing things to my eggplant that a children's video game character shouldn't.
peach r34 about to go crazy
LOVE LOVE LOVE ALL HER LOOKS, such a powerhouse princess 💅🏼🩷
"Mama mia, Peach, I need-a the rescuing"
What an awesome game for Princess Peach, another game with her as the main Star.  Let's pray that for future DLC, they added this costumes...  Vampire Hunter Peach. Dress in Simon Belmont clothes and armed with the Killer Whip. And with the Original OST Castlevania Theme Song.  Sentai Hero Peach. In Power Ranger costume, shell save the day and defeat the enemy.  Witch Peach.  Surfer Peach. In her cute Swimsuit and surfboard, she'll ride the waves and avoid sharks and rocks.
So, when is Zelda going to get her own game?      Oh, wait...
Where’s PMS Peach?
This game is about to be good. A game starring Princess Peach. Looks like the damsel in distress is finally gonna be the hero.
Yay princess peach with non-emotion based powers 😂
is it just me, or does Peach sound...different?
Barbie plus Wario?
At last, Princess Peach unlocks her full potential, as a swordswoman, a sleuth, a cook, a ninja, a cowgirl, and even a Kung-fu mistress!
I'm still debating whether or not if I want to play this. It looks really fascinating and amazing!! This kind of gives me more interest.
Her voice sounds a little too quiet/soft at some parts, but that’ll probably be fixed later. Or maybe that’s the point of the vibe idk
why do I have a sad feeling this is going to be just like detective pikachu where they treat you like a five year old that needs constant supervision and hand holding to even pick up a controller.
thanks god they only changed the artwork and not the actual model
Mario watching this trailer: "Why the heck did I have to go through all those dungeons for??!"  Bowser: "Ninja peach? so she could've assassinated me at any moment..." *shivers*
0:19 the internet is going to go hard with this one
I just want to know how long it is.
Looks great. The problem is that they're charging $60 for it. $60.
Peach will never need rescuing again. If she gets kidnapped, Mario, bro, that's on her from now on.
So...we're pretty much confirming Princess Peach's and Princess Daisy's special/smash moves in the next Smash.
Nothing beats Princess Toadstool in "Super Mario Bros. 2". Suck it Switch.
I love the idea of the game! The animation still looks like it needs more polishing in my opinion.
I’ve never realized how much I needed this in my life until now.
The sword one looks the most fun NGL.
I absolutely loved super princess peach. Can’t wait for this game!
I'm probably not the target audience for this game, but I'll probably get it anyway. Looks pretty fun.
I want Peach to be my wife. Especially Detective Peach.
I can hear the artists foaming at the mouths
So peach is just kirby now minus the sucking because she's a woman
Let's all take a moment to appreciate the fact that Peach _canonically_ became a ninja before Mario.
Why does this look 🔥?
You guys just keep making this game cooler and cooler!😊
Imagine what a new Smash Bros. could’ve done with this.
Looks like a kirby mini game collection
I know we're all thinking the same question here... Does Cowgirl Peach have a gun?
Reverse cowgirl peach
This just gives me Wario: Master of Disguise vibes, and I'm here for it
When did she become so capable? Too bad for Bowser, because this Marry Sue can't be kidnapped ever again.
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💕💕💕💕💕💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💘💘💘
Love these transformations!
Hey, Sega! It's time to bring back Princess Kurumi, isn't it?
I bet any fan of Peach would like to try on some of her wardrobe.
It's been a hot minute since another peach game came out this one looks just as good as the last game
Peach's voice is a bit.. off.
Peach.
I can describe how adorable this game looks, it’s definitely one I want to play when it comes out
I hope this goes well, Peach needs some love.
She's waaaaaaaaaay cooler than mario now like it's official!!
Now I wanna see what Action Movie or Spy Peach looks like!
Which transformation is your favorite? Mine is ninja
Its finally princess peach's year time to shine  its been so long since we had a solo game of her I cant wait!!!!
I didn't think I'd see another game where Peach would be the star of the game, but this holds potential. Can't wait for this game to release.
This may give some ideas to certain arist.😉
If only Smash had these forms of Peach in the game
Wants to be a Super Samsh  new special ⭐️💀⭐️
In my opinion, this looks to be like "Rayman in the Phantom show".
So it's a minigame compilation disguised as a platformer. Got it.
So they preferred making this instead of a newer Kirby
Cowgirl peach! She’s so cute
Im so happy for her to be so skilled in so many things and without PTSD after getting kidnapped so many times
Man, I hope mario gets kidnapped soon so I could play as Princess Peach to save him and defeat bowser and his minions!! This game looks really good, can't wait
Peach is trans confirmed!
Peach as a Ninja remember me of Asuka or Kasumi
Kinda looks like a Kirby game, I think it would habe been better  letting you choose what powerup to use instead of make extremely gimmickal levels
This game looks aweasome but i don't wanna spend another 60$😭
Peach doesn't neeed Mario and Luigi anymore. She can use her Ninja, cowgirl, swordfighter, detective, patissiere, and kung-fu skills the next time she's kidnapped by Bowser!
Ahhh I can’t wait!  This game is everything I’ve ever wanted!
Looks like Zelda isn't the only Nintendo princess that has become  a ninja (Sheik) and a pirate (Tetra).
I hope this is good!
Im here while this video doesn't have a million views yet
Ok this is cool and all but where is Waluigi?
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure that this is the first time a Mario character has used a sword in the franchise.  (Excluding spin-offs like Mario & Sonic, or crossover games like Smash Bros.)
I should add scene summaries of her as a ninja and cowgirl in my live action Nintendo themed show plot summary even if it will likely never be made. Katie Cassidy would look hot in those outfits playing her.
I hope we see hula dancer Peach.
Hear me out, Peach as a princess would be cool
Ok. That voice is NOT what I was expecting…
This looks pretty boring and lazy ngl. I have hope that it’ll be good cause Super Princess Peach was super good and fun 🎉
These all look so cool
Yeah!!!! 🤟
Ninja Peach 😍😍
Nice to see princess Peach breaking away from her usual role AND getting new outfits to boot!
Cowgirl Peach is just on another level of adorable- No wonder they didn't spoil that during the Direct announcement! 😊💖  Also can't wait to see what the cosplayers do with this whole game!
It’s great to see Peach get some spotlight for once
This new direction for Peach we've been seeing in recent feels like they've taken a bit from the RPGs. In those games, she's always been a little scrappy, but not as much as someone like Daisy. And with her being a playable character in most of the recent game helps as well. We've come a long way since the damsel in distress with the personality of a rice cake. Regal, but with a little bit of violence. As a treat.
I cannot express how much I love this direction for Peach. All the outfits are gorgeous!
It's like a Balan Wonderland Spiritual Successor.
Peach, whatever you want to be 🤗
I’m sorry but this voice actress is absolutely not it, and sounds nothing like peach
AKA the princess ain’t playing around.
Stunning. Brave.
I’m gonna ask to get this for my tenth bday
... And you didn't think about using any of those moves on the giant turtle?
While there is nothing objectively wrong or bad about this game, I gotta say, it just looks to casual and boring.
Finally peach will be able to fend for her self and not need mario to keep saving her
Very soon we will have enough Peach variations that she could be the only character in a Smash Brothers.
1:03 Forget about Kung Fu Panda. Kung Fu Peach is the one.
And yet she still needs to be saved by mario😂
Peach in the next Smash bros going to hit different
princess peach assless chaps, I'm BEGGING you
The more I see of this one the more excited I get.
Peach really is the barbie girl of Nintendo now lol. Still looks interesting, but I'm broke lol.
It feels like a Kirby Princess Peach game.
Can't wait for this! Looks so fun!
Is it me or does Peach have a new VA?
Least we know what Peach's moveset will be in the next Smash bros game
I knew there was a reason i bought the Peach Amiibo on launch day.
I can't wait to play this game!
Nintendo 👏 great job
Wow! If I had a nickel for every time a Nintendo princess turned into a ninja, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice. Right?
I hope it's not so easy to finish the game, or has a higher difficulty level for adults. Gonna wait it out for a demo or review.
Is it me or does peaches voice sound diferent when she says howdy
Ninja 🥷  Cowgirl 🤠  Sword fighter ⚔️ Detective 🕵️‍♀️  Patisserie 👩‍🍳 Kung Fu 🥋
Where's oldest profession peach?
Soooo a Princess Zelda game next when!?🙌🤞
Please make Daisy, Rosalia, and even Pauline playable for Co-Op!
Glad somebody was still able to make a cool mainstream game with a female protagonist without putting any ideology in there. Thank you, Nintendo!👸
When I saw Cowgirl Peach, I noticed that she wears different earrings in this form. As for the Ninja form, I noticed that she wears a smaller variant of her usual earrings. Great job to the people working on this game. I knew that you could give her a variety of jewelries. There is still a lot of work to do. As I already said in previous comments, I would love to see Princess Peach with a much bigger variety of outfits (including regal ones), jewelries, and hairstyles. Nevertheless, I can't wait to learn more about this game.
I’d this still Samantha Kelly?
Who else wishes they had these kinds of transformations?
Consiste en que no vayas a tener ninguna sorpresa y te cuenten todas las transformaciones del juego :) El próximo tráiler será enseñar todos los bosses.
Move over Kirby.
The world is healing
Is it me or the peincess peach voices changed as well?
I can't wait. im beyond hyped
I love how this game comes out the same day Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts concert starts
Zelda is foaming at the mouth angry 💢....
Girl power!
New Smash Bros alternate costumes.
wtf this looks actually cool!
Her voice sounds lower but I think that will give it more range and emotion. I’m exited to learn more about the game!
Now I can say that Princess Peach is a magical girl-
I think her VA is different.
Seems like a cool game I won’t play it though because I don’t believe in woman’s rights
My favorite is Ninja
All of Peach's designs here look awesome. I'm very keen to see how Detective Peach plays out in terms of solving mysteries. As a fan of shinobi and cowboys, I'm also really eager to see the sections where she's a ninja and cowgirl.
They changed her voice
Tears are streaming down my face im so fricking happy yall
omg she's sooooooooo pretty❤
Dayum she slayin'!
I love peach, and the stageplay idea is super clever, but why did they put a real horse in the Marioverse? What about Yoshi? 😢
Big hat in time energy
so its a minigame collection?
why does she sound....... not right?
Is it just me or does Peach's voice sound different from the other Mario games?
Ninja Peach looks sick!
Is this Peach ? (Wrong answer only)
I'm definitely saving my money for when this comes out. The fact that the subtitle of this game is "Showtime" makes me think of my own mother, who majored in Drama when she was in college.
Balan Wonderworld sat so Princess Peach Showtime could sprint.
What kind of game is this? Platformer or action rpg?
This looks really fun and awesome. In my opinion the coolest that the game version of peach has been. Imagine playing as ninja peach or sword fighter peach in smash bros. That’s a change that would be worth it
First Bowser, now Peach!  Who else shall become The Dragon Warrior?
Lit
I don't know why, but this makes me think Balan Wonderworld done right.
Didn't we see all this already?
It's neat to see all the little details like the stitching and supports on each set piece, that remind us that this is all happening on stage, except for the baking portion apparently. 🤔  These costumes are great and, again, exemplify the stage theme with each being the romanticized version of real deal; giant hat for the swordfighter, Sherlock getup for the detective, bkack clothes for the ninja, etc.
We need to see more of her peaches
this game looks very promising. It kinda reminds me of paper Mario and Yoshis crafted world, CANT WAIT!!!
If it me or does Peach sound a bit different
Did she said “howdy nword”?
We all agree if/when another smash game happens they NEED to revamp peach's moveset with this right?
They should do some sort of a nod at the end of each game types where she finds a message maybe, that says Mario is in another game (castle).
ah yes like kirby
artists gunna have fun with this one lol
NINTENDO OF AMERICA, MAKE PRINCESS PEACH SHOWTIME PLUSHIES!
AWW PEACH IS SO CUTE
If there's another smash game this should be utilized for a moveset.
Who let Nintendo cook bro?!?!
Is it me or does Peaches VA sound different?
I don't know what genre this game is besides "Action/Adventure" which is very vague. It seems experimental and different which is why I'm hyped for it!
Ok, after all this, if she STILL gets kidnapped in the next game, I'm gonna lose it.
Man if only Balan Wonderworld was this good.
She said: 🤠Howdy, there!🤠
Is it me or does Peach sound different
I don’t think we’re getting a Nintendo direct 😅
I'm definitely going to give this game a chance... Though I just can't feel that same energy to get it like a lot of people.
Let's face it. The only reason Peach let's Bowser kidnap her is because she's bored and wants to give Mario some exercise
looks like a gimmickfest that doesn't look engaging at all, balan wonderworld is better
artists are eating good today
Now give us Bowser Peach :)
Kinda feels like they didn't have a strong direction for this game gameplay wise but looks fun
Peach new moveset for the next Smash Bros game confirmed!
I hope Bowser isn't out to get her again though.
Did peach get a new voice actress??
Imagine if the end of the game reveals the audience was Mario, Luigi, Toads, Daisy, and all of Peach's other friends (and Bowser is there, too)!
Sounds like they got a new voice actor for Peach
Is the eye shadow on the kung fu Peach necessary?
New moveset for Peach for the next Smash gonna be wild
did they change the voice actor?
Peach's movelist in the next Smash is gonna be wild.
Isnt this the same video they already did?
Peach in the new smash bros gonna go hard
why tf peach got a bottle of straight tomato sauce 💀
Can we have a black and white remake or a new legends game
They’re saving Prostitute Peach for the full game
Is it just me, or does Peach sound way different?
God i cant wait for this game! It looks so fun!
Deviantart is gonna have a field day with this one
Im getting this game only for the ninja and kung fu stages
Looks charming, but uninteresting. Seems Nintendo is trying to adapt yet another "baby steps" IP, Kirby is successful, Yoshi not so much... here it comes Peach targeting the same audience
Look out, Mario! Here comes Princess Peach!
WOW 🤩👍
I noticed that Peach has a new voice.
Wtf with Peach's voice.
Must... Get... Game!!!! 👑 🍑
Peaches va sounding odd here
She sounds kinda different?
Does her voice sound different?
Is it just me or is she sounding a but different did they also change this voice actor  Or maybe its just the approach they took
So, our sweet, serene, genteel Peach inexplicably becomes a swordfighter and a ninja...while Mario is still left with his plunger.
whyyyyyyyyyyyyy does she not have her iconic voice anymore :( the whole point of princess peach is you can be feminine and soft and still be strong and cool. why are we taking away her core personality
Its official: Peach is on that Barbie era and Im not mad about it.
im sorry, but that is NOT Peach's voice
Dang. Peach in chaps is something else 😮
Not optimistic with this game
Warning: Do NOT Googled "Cowgirl Princess Peach"
Man, I *love* the fact that Ninja Peach exists now. She's so cool!
They are even changing her voice to be deeper😣 I guess they have no respect for girly girls. They all need to be “badass”
Other girls will never have what you've got to offer Strut your stuff and work it off, show 'em that you're better You're the one guys call their "Peachy" Come on, baby girl, show 'em, show 'em what you've got  Say you love me! Say you love me! But don't you ever break my heart... Intoxicate me with your own ecstasy, It'll never tear us apart  Oh no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! Baby, take it easy... Peachy Flash!  Showin' off your curves like a star looking groovy, Stylin' even hotter than the chicks in the movies! You're the one guys call their "Peachy", Come on, baby girl, show 'em, show 'em what you've got!  Say you love me! Say you love me! But don't you get the wrong idea... Our love is only a fantasy, Sorry, baby! Sayonara!  Oh no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! Baby, take it easy... Peachy Flash!
I'm a full grown man with no kids, so I'm getting this delivered to my door 😂
Why peach sound so different?
The only thing I'm not liking so far is her voice. She sounds like your typical Sara or Veronica or Kim
Not my kind of game but hey looks fun!
Kunoichi Peach is much more cooler than Kung Fu Peach! 🥷
I feel so happy that Peach has a solo game again, the game looks beautiful, and honestly I never expected these transformations!
Cool, New skins for the new smash Bros.
I can't believe peach killed eti... Wait wtf si wrong with her voice⁉️
it’s giving Snoopy’s Grand Adventure from all those years ago 😂
... Did they just go Cutey Honey with Peach? I'm down.
Peaches I love you 🍑
So many Peach alts that will never be in a Mario Kart game
Yes lets go!
Not peach. Just give the new character another name
Nintendo needed more female representation
Sounds like Sam Kelly is using the Peachette voice for Peach now...
This looks like shovelware.
So Peach is left-handed
Bowser won't mess with her now. XD
Can we just get a direct?
I can't get over the new voice. Its so jarringly different.
What a cashgrab excuse of a game. Super princess peach for the Ds on the other hand, now THAT was a Peach game done right!
Ninja Peach (Twilight Chapter) | Cowgirl Peach (Wild West Chapter) | Swordfighter Peach (Middle Ages Chapter) | Detective Peach (Distant Future Chapter) | Patissiere Peach (Prehistory Chapter) | Kung Fu Peach (Imperial China Chapter) | Peach (Present Day Chapter)  This is literally Nintendo's verison of Live-A-Live
Can’t believe they change peace’s voice
reverse cowgirl peach looks cool
AAA game !!! ❤❤
Ok this game looks great 😎😊
I need this game
3/22 illuminati skull & bones
Bruh
Imagine having these Diff peaches in smash bros!!!
Ninja kung fu peach!
I'm late
I just want to be ninja peach!
Great… Another swordfighter for Smash…
dear god its peak
They're taking a different direction with her voice too, from how she sounds. She doesn't have that soft- high pitched tone, in this game.
Anyone notice Peach's voice sounds different?
finally a game where they let peach SERVE
(fangirl squeal) OMG, I am so freaking hyped for this game! Princess Peach is my favorite Nintendo character of all time and my one and only idol! I want to be just like her, and we already have so much in common! She’s a princess, I consider myself to be a princess (lots of people, especially my mommy, call me a princess, and I love that), we’re both girly girls, we’re both very sweet and graceful, we both have the same favorite color, pink, we both love fashion, hearts, flowers and sweet treats, and we’re both very powerful fighters! I also really love ballet and acting, and I know very well that Peach does too! I want to be a voice actress, and I’d really love to voice her someday! She’s my dream role! I also always play as her in games in which she’s playable, and we always do our best to win together! Whenever we do, we’re both very happy!  I’ve always loved Super Princess Peach because Peach is the star of it, and I’m so happy that she’s finally getting another game of her own! So far, everything looks totally sweet! I absolutely love all of Peach’s transformations so far! My favorite one is Patissiere Peach, and my younger sister drew me a picture of her for Christmas, which I love very much! I hope that she can also turn into a ballerina and a witch (a good one, mind you)! I can’t wait to see what else will be in store for Peach in this game! I also hope that there will be a song with lyrics in it!  I’m so hyped for this game more than anything before, but I’m also very hyped for the remake of Mario vs. Donkey Kong and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD! I really hope that Super Princess Peach will get a remake someday, and after it does, it should definitely get a sequel! These three games will most definitely lead up to a full spinoff series for Princess Peach! I also really hope that Nintendo will someday make New Super Mario Bros. 3, remakes of Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Super Mario Galaxy 3, Mario Kart 9, remakes of the first Paper Mario game and Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, a Switch port of Paper Mario: Color Splash, a brand new Mario vs. Donkey Kong game, a new Mario Baseball game and a remake of and a sequel to Mario Sports Mix! I came up with some totally sweet ideas for them, including one for Super Princess Peach 2, and I hope that all of you and Nintendo will love them all just as much as I do! I just can’t wait for Princess Peach: Showtime! to be released! Yay! 🎭👸🏻🧚🏻‍♀️🧜🏻‍♀️🧞‍♀️💝💖💗💕🌹💐🌷🌸🌺🎀🩰🐱🦄🍰🧁🍩
This version of a tougher independent princess peach is better than the illumination movie's attempt. don't @ me.
Peach > Barbie
I'm super loving everything about this game, but, I'm feeling like her usual voice is different this time.... I mean, I can clearly hear her voice as a pattisier but in the other costumes it sounds different. Can someone confirm it please?
Some of these gotta be alternate costumes for Peach in Smash 6
Wait, did peaches voice also change in mario wonder??? Is deeper now
This game will do for Princess Peach what Greta Gerwig did for Barbie
Everyone think the voice of peach look diffrent   👇
es otra actriz de doblaje
Detective Peachkachu
I don't know why we need both Ninja Peach AND Kung Fu Peach but okay Nintendo, you do you
This looks…like a game… that’s for sure I think
Yes🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
I swear this has to be next level games I think
My favorite part about this game is that I still have no idea what it is going to be like
I want this game.
Peach in the next Smash Bros will be CRAZY
Wow, real original. What’s next? Pirate Peach? Space Peach?
COW BOY PEACH
Smash.
The voices change too! Peach's cowgirl voice is adorable!
Am i the only one who is happy that she doesn't have that "lil girl" voice anymore.? Sounds more grown up now! Finally!
🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else get Jessie vibes from the cowgirl outfit?
Cowgirl Peach looks awesome. I'm so hyped for this game to release!
Scorpion and Sub-Zero's reaction to Ninja Peach; 😍
Her voice now sounds like the actress who voiced Peachette
Peach is now Undertale yellow certified
This looks pretty cool
They should be the new driver in Mario kart tour
Alright peach 🍑 with these new transformation you are unstoppable.❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Present 7 Hours
Awesome! I’m now hoping for extra past boards and mini games in Mario Party Superstars.
Please tell me you're going to turn these Peach costumes into Amiibo. I want a whole army of Peach in my gaming room.
Incoming art of her in revealing/tight versions of these outfits in 3, 2, 1...
Looks like Princess peach might be getting a moveset update for the next smash bros. Game
PRINCESS PEACH MY BELOVED!!! I can't wait to play this game as soon as it comes out!
Detective Peach better have a detective pikachu reference
0:08 oh boy is she pulling a zelda here!? 😅
probably not gonna get it but looks cool.
Looks like a solid game!
Wow! Peach is now becoming Ninja Peach! This just keeps getting Better and Better! I Absolutely Love this!
If she can do all this, she can save her damn self the next time she get kidnapped.
Does anyone know what genre this is? Nintendo does a horrible job of letting us know
I really hope at the final boss, peaches final transformation would be a magical girl transformation ❤
is it just me or her voice sounds deeper
Is she actually a princess in any of them lol
Peach is Ms. Worldwide  Ninja- Japan 🇯🇵  Cowgirl - America 🇺🇸  Swordfighter - France 🇫🇷  Detective - Britain 🇬🇧  Kung Fu - China 🇨🇳
Nice 3DS 40 dollar game
I hope I see Hammer peach that would be cool.
Oh lawd, rule 34 is going to have a field day with this game.
One it feels like warioware but with no multiplayer
They changed her voice
How's this NOT cultural appropiation, Nintendo? Only thing left is Peach Quinceañera.

Princess Peach Hack-n-Slash  Princess Peach Hack-n-Slash  PRINCESS PEACH HACK-N-SLASH!
Peach sounds different
A game I never knew I wanted but I'm glad it exists it looks pretty  cool and interesting, peach finally has game if you don't count the DS Game
I was opening their would be a sci-fi space peach or a action hero super peach.
Can't wait for all the NSFW material of cowgirl peach man
Sigh. So many good Peach alts that could’ve been in Mario Kart Tour. Honestly she could use some more if we look at drivers like Mario with over 20 different alts and stuff
Didn't ape escape 3 do all these? Besides service
These look stinkin' GORGEOUS. Cannot WAIT for the game.
peach really just became a nintendo ninja
ill be expected a lot more videos made about peach on a specific website after this comes out
Bro, This Trailer is Raw. Nintendo actually COOKED with this Trailer. Can't wait for March, Dude!
Is it me or Peach's voice is not so adorable and high pitched?
Twelve years from now, in 2036, I predict another stupid "controversy" where some idiot finds out from Google that Mario is "51" and Peach is only "12." It's too stupid to be a real thing, but that's exactly what happened when her last game turned 16, and the average person sure isn't getting any smarter.
Can't wait to play this with my little sister
NINJA AND KUNG FU PEACH?! PINCH ME I'M DREAMING!
I saw this was in french first you cant fool me nintendo
And soon to be released... amiibo for each of her costumes!
is it just me or is peaches voice a bit deeper than normal?
So we got Ninja Peach as well as Kung Fu peach      She be taking a *Journey to the East* for this one (this is a joke)
Did peach get a new voice?
why always when a female character have protagonism the gameplay is focused on clothes? it happened to assassins creed, now peach
So nice to see Princess Peach in a BRAND new game after Super Princess Peach!!! She has gotten the spotlight again!!! Can't wait to play this game on March 22nd!!!
0:09 After seeing Ninja Peach, I have one thing to say: NINJA, GO!
Imagine you beat the game and it says "you can now play as wario"
Is it just me or does her voice sound different
In the words of Phillip J Fry…. “Shut up and take my money”
Ninja outfit is so cool!
*”SUPER MARIO WONDER TREATMENT”*
Watched the wrong language no wonder I was so confused
yooo this looks dope
My girl peach is kim possible
Peach sure can dress up in a lot of cool costumes!
Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach actually revealed to this game! I'm very excited to play Princess Peach: Showtime! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
If A Hat In Time was made by Nintendo
What's wrong with her voice
So does anybody else notice that Peach got her old face back?
New outfits!! Wish we had Hula Peach for the beach. ❤
It looks like this game will have a really diverse gameplay. It’s probably to test lots of things to see if a concept is liked by fans more than the others
They could have been at least a little creative with the names.... Momo Ishikawa, Peachy the Kid, Peachketeer, Peachlock Holmes, Pêche Carême, Ip Táo
OMG, I can't wait for this! 🤩❤
Her ninja outfit makes her look cool asf
people are talking about the mechanics and stuff but I'm just glad they did away with her high pitched voice
Is it just me or did Peach have a different voice in this game? She doesn’t sound like Peach at all.
It like that one that Peach was a ninja and assassinated the hokaga “insert flashback” 🥷🥷
Ngl this does look promising
Its like Wario Master of Disguise
who voiced peach?
Its like Wario Master of Disguise
Master Of Disguise But Super Princess Peach.
Wooow, look at all these new Peach mechanics that they'll probably incorporate into the Smash Brothers reboot.   This game looks different, I'll give it that.
The majour flaw to this game is that the gameplay changes up drastically too much between outfits.
Shame it wasn’t Pirate Peach
Peach in the next smash bros is gonna be crazy
Kind of reminds me of Wario: Master of Disguise, interesting.
Don't think My pancreas will tolerate all that sweetness, gonna die
I love this
YESSSSSSS SHE IS *_SLAYING_* ✨💖
I like the voice direction this time around. You can tell it's the same voice actor but she sounds more... Normal? Like she isn't trying to put on an overly high pitched voice. I like it.
Her voice was changed?! Also there seems to be an imbalance between feminine forms and masculine? Not sure if I like the direction this game is going in
What you did to her voice? 😭😭😭
Kong
This game has no right looking so damn good XD. They REALLY want to prove those who say Peach has no character wrong.
This looks like such a blast! Really excited for it to hit!
Peach's voice sounds.... oddly different...
It's official: Peach is a swordie
I Have Realized That Peach Has A Different Voice…That Cant Be Good.
this game is confusing is it like a bunch of mini games or like has a campaign like start to end ? does anyone know
Peach is ready to take the center stage and save every play from having a tragic ending.
The world isn't ready for Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, or Peach in Boots!!!!  Especially Kung-Fu Peach!
This looks so charming. It has so much variety. I can't wait!
I'm all in for this Barbie-fication of Princess Peach.
Peach is one-woman Live-A-Live game. Just need Cavegirl Peach and Robo Peach.
Are we just skipping the February Direct then
Is it just me or does she sound different?
10/10 im gonna buy this there's 2 ninjas I cant wait physcal copy because switch 2. If digital im not sure if it will switch over.
It's official, Peach is now part of the 'Kung Fu Panda' series.
The game looks amazing, but put Princess Daisy as a playable character, please Nintendo!!! I never asked you for anything!😢  O jogo parece sensacional, mas, coloca a Princesa Daisy como personagem jogavel, por favor Nintendo!!! Nunca te pedi nada!😢
Princess Gaiden  Cowgirl Shebop Great Fencer Peacher Detective Peachachu Cooking Mama Peach Crouching Bowser Hidden Peach
I’m excited
I’m so ready for this game
Nintendo casually giving peach two types of martial art:
But what exactly IS the gameplay idea for this game??? It's like when Sonic Frontiers was being developed. Sega refused to explain what the idea ever was. I just see a bunch of random game mechanics being shoved into this game, but no genre is identifiable.
This looks like what Balan Wonderworld should have been,
I love this Peach game. I guess I’m going to wait another year for a Waluigi videogame.
Cowgirl peach 💀
This looks phenomenal. Instant buy once it releases
Anyone notice how her voice sounds different?
Where is this in the mario timeline?
Did somebody say….  S L A Y ?
To think this is coming from the one who keeps getting abducted by a turtle for almost 40 years
I get that Peach has a new voice actress, but she sounds nothing like before. You'd think that they would try to get something similar.
2024年2月、プリンセスピーチの体験版の配信を希望します^ - ^
Guys, I'm not so sure Peach is straight anymore
Please change the box art for this game please.
Plenty of potential with this game. Just hope that with how creative this is, it's not over too quickly without any replay value. I wouldn't want this to feel like a proof of concept for a much expanded sequel on the next Nintendo console.  I could easily see a sequel already with Daisy as the second playable character and having her own style of transformations to suit her personality too.  As many have said, I do hope there are a few more transformations that we haven't seen yet like Spy/Secret Agent Peach or Pirate Peach.  Based on recent Super Mario RPG art of scrapped ideas, a Peach RPG with transformations would be great although Kirby might also fit that idea too.
I a-PEACH-iate you Nintendo for bringing Princess Peach into her own spotlight. As she deserves✨
If they ever make a future Smash game, Peach is gonna be an incredible character if they implement all these different personalities into her skillset.
Happy
On the New Nintendo switch 2
Peach on the next smash game is going to be more op than ever.
'Detective Peachu'  Aso, March 22 was two years ago?
I’m happy to see Peach getting her own game again. I played the heck out of Super Princess Peach as a child so I’ll definitely be looking forward to picking this one up.
I can't  wait to play this!!
Did peach's voice actress change? :o
I hope that there will be DLC where once you beat the main game, you can unlock Princess Daisy as a playable character, I would love to see that!❤❤❤
It looks neat, but this still gives me balan wonderland vibes. Hopefully, it isn't.
Any eagle eyes out there could see that her brooch is still part of the designs on Peach's costumes.        Answers further down...         You really wanna know? Okay.           It's on her ascot for sword fighter, her collar for detective, the left breast of her smock for patissiere, dangling on her hairpin for kung fu, on her sash for ninja, and clasping her bandana on cowgirl.
Green Strider Scarf for the Ninja form. Cool
This game looks great. SEGA should make game about Amy Rose.
Awesomeness!
Nice to see Super Princess Peach 2
Cowgirl toadstool.peach
Ninja mistress toadstool peach
Strong independent peach... Feminism game.
peach meets kirby, yes please
Bleh
Is it just me, or does Peach have a new voice actor?
wait...it's only me or the voice of peach has changed?...
Love her new voice direction! She sounds much more mature and older
Waiting for the TTYD trailer
I love how a lot of these costumes show peach's personality.  Patisserie: her love of baking  Detective: her knowledge and wit  Swordfighter/kung fu: her discipline and honor  Cowgirl: her bravery and fun loving side  Ninja: her quick thinking and lightness on her feet  All of these highlight peach so well with who she is, clever, regal, strong, and dependable. She may be kidnapped in almost every Nintendo game but when she needs to step up to the challenge, she can get things done like the fearless leader she is. People are saying the girlboss thing isn't cool but she's the ruler of a kingdom, she has to be prepared, I'm certain that behind the scenes, she's doing all she can to escape from bowser, picking the lock, punching him from her cage, and just remaining calm as to not let her subjects lose hope. She's strong even in her weakest moments, she's never been helpless, just backed into a corner and this game gives us a chance to see what she can do when she's not tied down by her captors and can actually do what she's been doing for years, being a symbol of strength for her kingdom
Imagine if this was the Peach we got in Smash
I am screaming with joy! Peach is FINALLY doing everything I ever wanted her to do!!!
Yi Yah! Balan Underworld done right!  Thanks big N.
she has a new voice?
should be four characters, peach as the standard, daisy is like the luigi where she gets a small boost (speed or strength), rosalina keeps her spin attack, and pauline can shoot music note projectiles
Perfect song for this gotta be Ava Max - Choose Your Fighter
Really liked the last Peach game (Mario is Missing)
And where exactly is Bowsette?
If Princess Zelda can be a Sheikah "Ninja", then so can Princess Peach.
Looks like a minigame mash up game for girls. Not for masculine men like me
"cowgirl" Peach, interesting hahaha
X artist will be on it like Pokemon sword and shield before it came out
Pseudoregalia
I know who Detective Peach should team up with! Pikachu!
What drives me away from this product.. is the fact that it is probably a few worlds barely designed. Unlike Luigi's Mansion that has a robust system and different biomes, this one has mechanics that will probably only be used for a few minutes and amount to nothing much by themselves.. like Mario Party Mini-Games.
why is she so violent? using sharp weapons and punching people? next time she gets kidnapped, we know she's faking AF
Very curious how challenging will be. If it’s <75% the difficulty of Wonder, I’ll be disappointed.
Waiting for Plumber Peach.
Now just give us a game for Daisy too please
Can we have this with nabbit next?
Bruh…. She is gonna be so cracked in the next smash bros
Nintendo is ripping off -Ninja Gaiden  -Red Dead Redemption -Assassins creed  -Ace Attorney  -Cooking Mama -Street Fighter
Detective Peachachu
Princess peach is everything, he is just mario😊
Woke world: women should be this and that Nintendo: women can be whatever they want to be, ninja or baking cakes
So instead of giving her an identity, they just made her a blank slate and applied different themes.
Go Princess Peach: Showtime! (which is not my favorite game)
Eh.
This reminds me of Cutey honey.
This game looks freaking fun! Can’t wait.
Im excited for Peach, but i still want a new yoshi game, preferably one with yoshi having a 3d adventure.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. I hope this game fails hard! 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
her voice sounds different
Cowboy Peach is more threatening than Dak Prescott in January.
So they're trying to make her mortal Kirby?
Kirby peach edition?
Nah this game boutta be 5 hours long
Is it just me or is her voice different?
Calling it: the final boss will have a unique transformation for Peach.
Cue the Peach Cosplayers in 3... 2... 1...
I will enjoy the R34 of these for years to come 😎
Already pre ordered ty nintendo
kinda gay lol
look guys is princess durazno
Praying we get ballerina peach
Can’t wait for the next smash game to forget this game happened only for fans to create a moveset based on this game
Her little voice lines are so cute I'm in love with this game already
Oh my God, we have Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach. Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
Just wait for another Super Smash Bros Game. They will use this version of Princess Peach while Princess Daisy retains the old moves.
I cannot wait to play this game. This game feels like a spiritual successor in the best way possible!
I'm not saying it doesn't look fun, but this looks like a game for people who don't play games
No more high peached Peach
pass
wait a minute! her voice is diffrent!
nintendo: hey sakurai we announced new super smash bros. and here you have new outfitss and moveset ideas for peach.  sakurai: but i wanted to make another kirby game.....
Changeable outfits have always been my least favorite aspects of modern games. I don't care what the character looks like, and if thew outfits don't affect game play what's the point. But this looks like it breaks  from that mold.
Thanks for another free game lol
Is this game made by Next Level Games? And does Peach have a new VA? 😢
Worry I hate the new peach voice, it's so boring XD
Mario is chasing donkey kong for stealing toys Luigi is in a haunted house Wairo is doing his thing Yoshi is a marketable plushie and peach is in a stage What could daisy and Wa┌uigi be doign right now Robbery?
YESSS MY GIRL PEACH. So excited for this game lol
Peach is trying to become the next Smash roster by herself.
Are there more transformations?
So it’s a costume game
Princess Peach 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵!
This better be her moveset for the next smash 😂
How many transformations is peach supposed to have in all?  Just these?
Does Nintendo also change the voice of Peach?
The gameplay is looking very basic, like less than Kirby.
Uh oh, Peach is being a woke girl boss! Better make six rant videos about it!! /s
0:39 Is that Amelia Watson Peach?!
Yet she still gets kidnapped by bowser in nearly every other game.
Kirby-sensei is proud of his pupil.
I hope there will be more transformations revealed (or as DLC), and if there is more, there’ll be a Songstress Peach 🎶
Kung Fu Peach sounds like a soft drink flavor
Can we get swimsuit peach?
this is cool and all but why tf does peach sound like that
Gameplay looks really interesting! I'm really excited for this one!  Now I noticed that her voice seems to be different depending on which costume she's wearing, which is kinda fun if it's supposed to be like Peach REALLY getting into character. Unless that's supposed to be her the theatre's guardian spirit, Stella, in some of the voice clips? The clip for her as a Patisserie sounded basically like she usually does, so that could be the case as well.
And many more?
This looks so cool. Peach finally got her own game since super princess peach. I've got a feeling Detective peach is gonna be my favorite. Love figuring out puzzles in detective mode. Can't wait till it comes out.
This game looks really fun. Cant wait to play Ninja and Knight Peach
AWESOME!!!
Such cool transformations for Peach! Princess Peach: Showtime looks awesome to play, and cant wait to buy it!
thank you
Any game that has peach performing stealth kills is a 10/10
With a trailer for this and mario vs donkey kong out over the last 2 weeks are they pushing these trailers out of the way for bigger things in the February direct? Whatever the case I expect this February direct will be the last one for the switch. Go out with a bang and finally show us metriod prime 4!
Yes i mean i love the Peach spin-off idea but what genre is even this
I really hope this game influences her design in the next smash bros game
Why no Pirate Peach?
Some website are about to go crazy rn💀
Some of these transformations look a lot more exiting than the others
Princess Peach 2 Electric Boogaloo
Cowgirl peach. I see what you doing Nintendo.  Kids don’t know but the grown ups do
This is easily my most anticipated game of the year. Seriously, I can’t wait to play it! I just really hope these aren’t the only costume Peach is gonna have, because I have so many ideas for what this game can throw at us. Ninja and Cowgirl Peach are so freaking cool though! I’m gonna have so much fun with those, I can already tell!
Multiplayer local pleasee?
SHE CAN DO IT ALL!!!! CAN'T WAIT!!! 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
I’m glad to see Peach getting more character
New voice?
Detective peachachu
After this game.... Bowser must be wanting to marry her even more. But now kidnapping her will be waaaay harder. Bowser must up his game now. 😆 This game looks amazing. ❤️💖👑🍑
300
WESTERN THEMED STAGE‼️‼️‼️‼️
Did peach get a new voice?
Anyone else hoping for an overhaul for her smash moveset inspired by this game?
Where was this energy when she was getting "kidnapped" to bowser castle
If Peach knows Kung-Fu then why she can defend herself from Bowser? 🤔
It Takes Two but Nintendo
I am so bisexual for Peach my god
I Can Imagine The Nintendo Meeting Went Something Like   " So Hear Me Out Kirby...But As Princess Peach !!
0:18 Fierro pariente con la caguama y todo en mano alv
Ok now I know Peach only lets herself get kidnapped so she has an excuse to go on Holiday. 😂😂😂😂😂. Seriously she has a Love Sick Turtle catering to her every need while Mario steps in to take her place. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
All i can say is that the next smash game is gona be pretty sweet for this one characters
I can’t wait for this game. Another game for her is long overdue! First DS game was Super Princess Peach.
Can't wait for Reverse Cowgirl Peach!
Finally  More Peach R34 content
Can’t wait to experience this new game once it’s comes out.
something about this reminds me of Warioworld and I don't know why because they look completely different. Love Warioworld though
still don't know what this game even is but ok
Awesomeness video please do more thanks 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm looking forward to pirating this game.
I’m fine with Ninja Peach, thank you. 😊
Peach in the new smash is gonna be S tier if she utilizes any of this
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
More like Ninja Master, and Sheriff Peach
Balan Wonderworld done right?
The game looks fantastic and I can't wait to finally play it, the only thing that bothers me is the sound effects when you collect coins, that sounds a bit generic, i hope it's just a place holder.
So this is just Kirby with extra steps and they gave Peach’s voice the Sonic Frontiers treatment?
Cowgirl Peach? I would think she's seen _Back to the Future Part III_ one time too many if she's wearing that.  Peach: (pointing a Colt .45 Single Action Army Peacemaker at us through a mirror) "You talkin' to me? ... You talkin' to *_me,_* Koopa?!" (makes a disarming, shrugging pose) "Well, I'm the only one here..." (returns to brandishing the pistol and practices a Clint Eastwood squint) "Go ahead! make my day..."
So was changing Peach’s voice actress really necessary or..?
Big Cowgirl Peach Fan 😮‍💨🤠
This is everything I've ever wanted from a Peach spin-off game.
Yassssz Queen!
Is this a collection of mini games or a platformer? (or both?)
What if Nintendo made amiibo of Peach in all those different outfits?
I’m so excited for the cosplays this game will inspire
Cool Nintendo.  . . .  NOW GIVE US PAPER MARIO!!
I'm not going to lie: this is giving off a major Kirby vibes, and I absolutely love it🤩
Finally a Princess Peach game. My mom is going to be happy.
Wait does Peach have a new voice actress? She sounds different
Now give Zelda some attention oh wait Aonuma doesn’t give two craps about her…
She's everything. He's just Mario.
I don't expect this game to be challenging, but it does seem fun and I getting it at some point.
Peach is now getting the spotlight since the movie and 3d world
Peach was taught Ninjutsu from Hanzo Hattori or Ryu Hayabusa and Kung Fu from Chun Li
This looks really cool, but I still have one question: what exactly is this game supposed to BE, anyway? Also, if the final boss (if there is one) doesn't involve Peach turning into Bowser, I'm gonna lose it.
I still just need to know what the level structure of the game is.
Se mira de los mas aburrido 😅
Can't wait for this video game to come out.❤
Still holding out for Pirate Peach!
I love this version of peach, it is like a softer Barbie or something
Peach voice is different 😢
0:52 let her cook
This is cool and all, but now I want Showtime Daisy already
This really feels like a game for girls. But in a VERY respectable way.   Like it does have that dress up aesthetic that girls are associated with in like dolls. But gave the same level of game design respect than you would say “boy games” were like violence or som.
Im sure our boys across the internet are working overtime after this drop.
Can't wait to do wall jumping Badge Challenges as Ninja Peach while being chased by shadows. This awesome music for Kung Fu Peach is like the sequel to the Purple Coins theme!
I want some cowgirl peach
Dumb and stupid
Oh no the rule 34 artists will have a field day whith this!
Dude all the outfits for Peach in this game just absolute slaps like i'm becoming insane over them
0:24 Undertale yellow lol
Shut up and take my money
peach displaying her innate multi-talents  once again!👏 also did they they use a different voice actress for this one?
MY GAME OF THE YEAR 🩷🩷🩷🩷 yipieee
q
Is it me or I'm hearing a new voice actress for Peach?
There's this guy with 34 rules for drawing that will have a lot of inspiration for his artworks thanks to this game.
Ok this looks amazing now!
Why do I feel that this is their attempt to redo metroid: other m?
Peace doing ninja moves fighting with swords I dont dont know how I feel about this
mario better
POV: Mario, Luigi, Toad, Bowser are in the audience
Interesting Barbie game, woman of many professions.
Peach fans is definely playing this game
A very strange Barbie game
Imagine they incorporate this into Peach’s moveset for the next smash with floating!
Game looks very cute and super fun. Instead of levels changing, the character changes. Very cool stuff.
Oh they changed her voice. I don't like it. But the game looks pretty cool
Mixture of Kirby and Yoshi games, has that type of charm and simplicity.
These are soo lovely! Very excited to learn more about the mechanics of the game
She sounds a little older.
Only 6 transformations ? That's very low
I feel like sometimes peach just pretend to be a damsel in distress to keep mario busy and not getting bored lol 😂 i mean come on, she did manage to handle alot of challenges herself lol and even showed bowser whos boss 😊❤
720p  like always
The simps are going to love this
I think we all know where this is going
This game is wonderful!  Congratulations to the Nintendo team for creating exciting and great games!❤
I didn't expect it at all, the princess game seems unique to me!❤
Peach really expanding her job list. She's trying to be more than the healer the next time they give square the rights for an rpg.
I fear the R34 degenerates when this game drops…
It's a shame a lot of people will probably overlook this just because it has Princess Peach instead of Mario in it. This game actually look really good and I think him to be a great addition to any Mario fan, or any platform or fan in general. This will be a day one purchase for me, provided I have the money for it anyway LMAO!
0:34 Can't get over how Peach basically has ultra instinct as Sword Fighter Peach lol
This looks terribly generic, I guess this is supposed to be for children but I know these fanboys acting like this looks so great aren't children. It's quite pathetic.
Ninja-Fluttershy Cowgirl-Applejack Swordfighter-Rarity Detective-Twilight Sparkle Patissiere-Pinkie Pie Kung Fu-Rainbow Dash
that don't sound like peach
Ngl this didn't look interesting until ninja peach, that design go crazy for her.
Its so sad that nintendo is getting too much influence from the west...they even changed peach's face on the cover to make her look like those determined common disney female characters , which is unlike peach...
And for When The Princess Daisy 👑🌼 have own videogame...???🤔🎮
Save me white woman
Is it me or is her voice a bit  deeper? Did they switch her VA or something?
I really want this video game so much! I should be the first one to buy it when it gets to March 22!!
Cool game idea, but not something I’d want to play. Peach sounds like peachette -5 points.
This is the Mario game I'm looking forward to most
She is going to have the craziest iteration on the next smash game
Can't wait to play this one.
I cant wait for this
I was waiting an HackAndSlash of Princess Toadstool😂
Did they change Peach's voice actress? She sounds a little off Game looks neat though
Amazing ❤❤❤❤
👌👌
Princess Peach in finally channeling her pink Kirby style Swiss Army Knife energy! I dig it!!
I still have no clue what you are supposed to do in this game.
Ninja Peach is FIRE!!!
Cowgirl peach😍
No one has any clue what this game even is. Looks fun though.
i can't wait to see a soldier peach with her M-60 saying "C'mon boy" 😂🤣
Peach is also a Kunoichi? Cool, I wish they saved this for the Nintendo Direct, I wanted to be surprised.
this game is gonna be 80 bucks and too easy.
Is this just another one of those mega easy op Kirby games but Peach themed?
Okay, I absolutely love these, but I do hope there's one super-sparkly transformation... like maybe an endgame Magical Girl Peach or something. That would be the perfect cherry on top.
Super Princess Peach looking better than ever..
Yet, the faces in the images look adorable compared to on the US case. Nice.
Is it just kept or does peach have a different voice?
I really do love that Peach has her own gand again in a different nee format. I hope we can customize those outfits that she wears base on those styles that was shown in the trailer.
I should've know there Ould be a cowboy and a ninja transformation.
If Peach got reworked as Swordfighter Peach in Smash Bros people would complain about yet another sword person lol
This is looking  like a better Balan Wonder world
The setting is similar to SMB3? It's just a theatre?
Can’t wait to play this.
“What do you have?!”  “A kunai!” “NOOOO!”
Arin Hanson I’ll be expecting you on this
The R34 is strong in this one
Looks super fun, another good Nintendo game I'll be buying over PS5 games.  Amazing how far ahead Nintendo is of other consoles
Bowsers favorite is the cowgirl one.
Did Peach get a new voice actress?
Cowgirl peach reminds me of Jesse from Toy Story.
Brace yourself, the cosplays are coming 😂
if mario kart tour continue then peach will have these costumes in the game 😭
We now have Ninja and Cowgirl Peach. I wonder what other surprises this game has…?
She’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she IS the *MOMENT* 💖💖💖
There is no way Peach allows herself to be kidnapped by Bowser again after the badassery she's showing here
I love peach so much but idk how I feel about her new voice
It looks like Princess Peach is the master of disguise and stuff!
I can't wait to buy this ON PHYSICAL CARTRIDGE .THIS.MARCH. .
I'm not too sure about her new voice... or new grunts? She sounds so different than we are used to...
Oh yeah my girlfriend gonna love this game as a gift 🎁
Ninja Peach is best Peach.
on my knees🙏
Looks like it should be a pretty cute and fun game!  Nice to see a new Peach game again.  It’s been since Super Princess Peach, yeah?
So excited for this game!! Cowgirl Peach looks so cool!!!🤩
I'm so excited for this game!!! I have such fond memories being in middle school playing Super Princess Peach! 💝 It's especially wonderful that this trailer is released on my birthday! 😭💐
I love how the enemy designs are original and can't wait to see how this fits in the world of Mario.
wow
Definitely looks like an exciting game!
For a strange reason, this game feels like a Luigi's mansion with Kirby mash up
Ninja peach is the one I’m looking forward to the most
I can already see there being some really cute and cool art from these new outfits. And also some…. Well you know what cause it’s the internet.
This is Nintendo’s latest and dare I say GREATEST GAME?!
This game looks so beautiful!🤗🤗🤗🤗😁😁😁😁🤩🤩🌸🌸🌸 My favorite costumes are swordfighter, detective, ninja and pattiserie 😁😁😁😁😁😁🤗🤗🤗🌸🌸🌸🌸💖💖💖 But cowgirl and kung fu are cool too!🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤩🌸🌸💖💖💖
You know what… The more I see the more I’m intrigued
YES LETS GOOOO
Cowgirl Peach is going to rope NSFW artists straight into a cease and desist
Peach is getting buffed for the next smash Bros
Peach is truly the Perfect Assassin
Why is Princess Peach more powerful than Mario now?
O flower of scotland When will we see Your like again, That fought and died for Your wee bit hill and glen And stood against him Proud edward's army, And sent him homeward Tae think again. The hills are bare now And autumn leaves lie thick and still O'er land that is lost now Which those so dearly held That stood against him Proud edward's army And sent him homeward Tae think again. Those days are past now And in the past they must remain But we can still rise now And be the nation again That stood against him Proud edward's army And sent him homeward, Tae think again. 0 flower of scotland When will we see Your like again, That fought and died for Your wee bit hill and glen And stood against him Proud edward's army, And sent him homeward Tae think again.
So... Peach is basically Barbie now.
The music is a bop as always.🎵🎶
Is that a new voice actress for peach? Honestly I can’t tell…
She’s peach Minaj, peach lewiski, peach the boss, peach the ninja, peach the harajuku Barbie like I don’t even know why you bother at this point 😂
me googling cowgirl peach  💀
Can't wait for the fan vids/artwork.
There are plenty of Olimars in this video
Damn she looks sexy in the new costumes she’s 100% better then Rosalina
This looks so amazing!
R34 artists: *sigh*
This looks like an afterthought, just a reskin of a different game.
Peach is a character that never really gets her time to shine, it’s always Mario. So happy to see Peach finally getting another game! Showtime is going to be a great addition to the franchise.
mario oddysey got some rivarly
This looks so fun! I'm glad Peach is getting a game that's totally her own thing, not just "Mario platforming, but with Peach."
This is looking more and more like Nintendo doing ‘Puppeteer’, that game from the PS3 era, and lucky for them, I love that game.
Ninja Peach is awesome in a way but if only there were Samurai Peach. 0:02 🤣
Nintendo, can you give us the characters' Olympics costumes outside of the _Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games_ series?
Wow!!! So cool!
Cant wait!! Day before my birthday too 😁
Strung Whamon
Internet “artists” are about to have a field day
The Cosplaying community eating good tonight.
nintendo never almost never fails
This is so random...I love it
This is going to be super awesome.
Even Bowser's new attempt to kidnap Peach will be futile as well! 👍❤🍑
This looks great! Loving the new Ninja and Cowgirl Peach. I am so glad that Peach looks like this and not like the new cover art they changed to a while back. I was so worried that they had changed the whole game to look like that. I hope that they give us a way to obtain the original cover art. I'd hate to see it in the icon on the Switch, especially since the game doesn't even look like that.
i better be able to play as luigi
Persona 3 ✋️  Princess Peach Showtime 😊
This looks like a great peach game🙂but i’m still wondering who is developing this game🤔
A Peach for any fetish.
Is this just a series of themed minigames? if so, im severely disappointed...  however, if this is just a platformer in the style of "a hat in time" where each level/world has different gameplay elements, then im intrigued.
this game looks really great. what i am waiting on the most from nintendo is luigis mansion 2 hd. hopefuly they come out with a release date in the next nintendo derect.
Is that another new voice actor?
As of March 22, 2024, both of Nintendo's leading princesses will have been ninjas and swordfighters.
They literally meant it when they said "She can do anything!"
it’s getting better and better I’m looking forward to get peaches game.
Samantha Kelly You Still are Best  Voice Of Peach. Over than 17 years and Now Finally She get Own Game❤
Look out Mario, Princess Peach is stealing the show!
Laughing my I love how her voice changes from a peach voice to a Barbie voice😂
Where can I get outfits like those? This is awesome!
What's next to be added? Idol Peach
🥷s call me the Peach
I cannot express how much I love this direction for Peach. All the outfits are gorgeous!
The transformations… the voice, PRINCESS PEACH SHOWTIME HERE WE COME 😍
loved that amelia watson is in the game lol
This looks SO awesome.... but why does it have to come out on the same day as Dragon's Dogma 2 AND Rise of the Rōnin. Ugh, first-world problems 😩
Still wish you guys could change the box art render back to the same as it is in Japan (and in the actual game itself) the face on it as it is looks really off-putting
Im scared of what certain "artists" are going to do to this game once it releases.
And people think Peach is basic.😏
Nintendo makes the BEST games for kids and also people WITH kids. Just pure fun games with little chucks of gameplay at a time while the boys nap or after they go to bed. Will buy.
I love these transformations for Peach!
So peach is basically kirby with extra stepps?
Patisserie Peach. The cake is FINALLY not a lie!!! 😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm so excited to see Peach branch out and be less one-dimensional
Peaches voice sounds a little different  , but I still love it!!
Könnte zelda auch ihr spiel bekommen? Das sie aber kein spinn off bekommt. so ein richtiges the legend of zelda mit zelda das sie vielleicht link rettet oder so
Peach's voice...is different...
Now release a collection of all these costumes in amiibo poses!
This legit looks like an insane great game!!
OMGGGGGGGG YES YES YES YES PEACH IS THE BEST
Still have literally no clue what this game is 😂
is this the second peach game?
Peach could play a builder. Reference to Super Mario Maker and allowing great environmental puzzles with according machines
Balan Wonderpeach
Maybe this game is a confirmation of Game Theory's video about Peachette metamorphising into Peach, and that's why they made her sound more like Peachette
Seeing this, we already need a Sequel
This game looks so fun! The only thing, is that I hope they don't make it too easy
Good to see more transformation of Peach like: Adventure Peach (Indiana Jones inspired), Magical or Wizard Peach (Magician), Agent Peach (Spy), Jungle Peach (Tarzan inspired), Pirate Peach
Oh, snap.  Kunoichi Peach?  I am even more down to play and purchase this game than before!
(Cracks a root beer) Let's see what this has in store.
This game looks like it's gonna be super fun and Kung Fu Peach sounds like a great tea flavor!!
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:08 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awesome! She can definitely defeat Pac-Mom any day!
No Elephant Peach?
0:24 barbie's horse adventures
Nintendo fans are all too familiar with “Cowgirl Peach” 🫣
PEEEEEEEACH!!
This looks… really good!
They were going to have her as a shoemaker, but Peach Cobbler became confusing.
Sounds like a different VA.
The logo looks pretty with the ponytail on the P in Peach 1:09 The eyes are different based on the transformation and those designs look amazing. Can't wait for Abdallasmash to play this.
I wish princess peach would wear a pirate outfit🏴‍☠️
When the transformation peach looks the happiest in is the one that gets her back in the kitchen
That Game Is So Cool
damn she fine
I wanted to like this game, but it just feels too unfocused
Hearing peach say new words is strange
Already have this preorder along with Mario Vs DK. Now drop the sku for TTYD and Dark Moon Remakes/Remasters already plus the Switch 2 i got preorder money ready to go Nintendo!!!
お転婆すぎるｗ　白馬の王子様を待つようなお姫様ではないなあｗ
Sweet Peach Blossom will be all over this
Aint no way they got her to say "Howdy there" just then 😆
Ninja and Cowgirl?! Take me money now Nintendo ❤
Be the American Japan thinks you are.
You think she would use at least one of these skills to stop Bowser from kidnapping her...
one of the few new games I'm looking forward to this year.
Peach should have those transformation moves for the next Smash Bros game.
Detective Peachachu
I hope Waluigi get a game one day
This has my money all over it.
This looks really good but I wish we would see some gameplay but I like that they changed it up with peach as the star and maybe even daisy as a playable character
Barbie: "Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!"
Why do I get the feeling that this is Nintendo's The Amazing Digital Circus? Lol
Would be a little more interested than I am now if her Cowgirl transformation had a revolver and a lasso, but it still looks interesting nonetheless.
Which version is going in the next Smash game?
I am so looking forward to this
Artist, you know your job
I wonder if this will change her move set in smash 🤔
This game is going to be PEACHY!
You're that ninja...
No plumber peach?
You would think Nintendo would save a trailer like this for a direct. Unless they have bigger plans in store.
Yes, I'll take 10 copies
The forbidden site will feast today
The game feels like A Hat In Time.
now when are we going to get to play as zelda?
It's just givibg off that balan wonderland vibes.
They gave her a heroic voice instead of her damsel in destress voice!!!!!! I love it
Princess Peach: Master of Disguise
Please give us a demo. This looks good, and i think some may pass up because of its cuteness. So i think a demo would help this out alot.
0:23 *Sonic:* Dropping bombs while running away? I've heard about roadwrecks, but give me a break!
I kinda like how Peach is Nintendos Barbie
Meh the more I see the more i lose interest
I feel some Cutey Honey vibes here
Finally, Peach can be a Nintendo Ninja now.
I love peach games so much
Put this moveset in the next smash game
So it's just Barbie for Peach?
so it's basically kirby with ...blowing... instead of inhaling.
I'm glad that Peach has been given her time to shine. It's been almost 20 years since her last game. Not sure how I feel about her deep voice in game though.
If they ever make another Smash game, they could have a lot of fun with Peach's moveset
So weird they looked at the Mario Party 2 costumes and decided to make a Peach game of it.
I really miss Parakerry from the DS
This reminds me subtly of Kirby's Epic Yarn! Please allow there to be a port of that game to the Switch, Nintendo!
NEW VOICE!
I can't wait for this game
This game looks incredible
Wow this actually aeems like it could maybe be fun. If its not just baby game easy the whole time
Danm im ab to simp
Samantha isn't voicing  peach?
My favorite outfits are Ninja, Swordfighter and Kung Fu.
Kirby would be proud! 💗
You know I had an idea where they can incorporate This Games Elements with Peaches Character on Super Smash Brothers.  The idea is that peaches down special would be a costume change into 3 of the costume we all saw so she’ll have a total of 4 Forms to fight in.  Theirs her main form which will stay light weight character with her Smash attacks being replaced by Sparkles Ribbon attack   Then Comes SwordFighter Peach, she’ll become a Mid weight character with her neutral Special Being a Chargeable Thrust like Marths and her recovery Special can be the Upper Spiral Attack we saw that’s similar to Soras Up Special and her Side Special will be that Afterimage Maneuver we saw if you time it right she’ll swiftly Maneuver her right behind her Opponent   Next will be Kung Fu Peach, she’ll become a Slow Moving Mid Weight with Strong Kicks personally like that Chinese girl From Street Fighter   And Finally Ninja Peach, she’ll be a Quick Moving Lightweight with Fast and Sneaky Attacks like all good Ninja  So what do you think
Hope you all got your tickets early!
0:07 Link Peach Apparently exists...
This is gearing to be quite a show! 👑 🩷
I’m so glad they didn’t movie-fy her face! Like that’s the least important thing here but it would’ve definitely been a detractor if they’d done that.
Is her voice deeper?
0:05 tsugi ni omae wa "your princess is in another castle" TOYU!
Is it just me or does Peach’s voice sound different
Nintendo has done it again 👍👍
This is gonna sound weird, but I was kind of hoping for a Clown Peach as well.
LET’S GO MY QUEEN!
Sadie adler really gives this game a nice touch
The music is unexpectedly nice.
A Kuno-Peachy, if you will. I cannot take credit for that one.
Friendly reminder, they're orher Mario Characters like Princess Daisy & Waluigi that deserves the Spotlight  too Nintendon't... so why are u Brainwashing Fans with your Huge Ego😒
Peach is out of the dress and finally is doing real work. Would have liked it more if we got corporate, rockstar, fast food, teacher, and construction worker peach but I will take this. If a sequel happens I hope at least one of these forms would make the cut.
R34 artists are gonna go crazy with this💀💀💀💀💀💀
I'm in love! it looks like we're finally getting a good standalone princess peach game omg
Did Peach learn ninja skills from Kiriko from Overwatch? And cowgirl skills from Jessie from Toy Story?
I’m gonna sound stupid, but do Peach and Toadette/Peachette have the same voice actor? Cause Peach sounds more Toadette/ Peachette than herself. Or maybe it’s a different voice actor entirely?
Princess Peach should sword fight with Lady Oscar from the Rose of Versailles.
Peach saying "Howdy, there!" isn't something I needed until today.
It’s been a while since Nintendo made a massively underperforming game. Good job Peach! You’re about to remind everyone why there are very few female protagonists in gaming.
R34 artists gonna lose their minds over this
Essa música aqui em 1:00 está top demais,a bateria detona tudo!  O jogo parece estar fantástico!
What happened to Peach's voice 😭
SHE IS BASICALLY THE HUMAN VERSION OF KIRBY!!!
This game looks awesome!!
Peach is really gonna Gaslight, Gatekeep Girlboss
So its Kirby but with Peach? Neat.
TWO MONTHS LEFT FELLAS!
Someday Waluigi will have his own game, but he won't be playable in it :D
One thing  the Copy ability  One Character Already Does that kirby
Peach is everything, everywhere, all at once.
Oh so the Ninja is a different costume from the Kung Fu one. But in all seriousness though, this game looks pretty good but the same time, feel like it would be short.
Wait if there is a cowgirl peach…..and there was a cowgirl Pauline then…..👀😮
No hate but I'll pass on the game
Looks like an awesome game to give your daughter for their birthday. Start the gaming addiction early >:) Mwahaha!
This with  a kirby crossover would go crazy
Nice!
man fanartist are gonna have a field day
Anyone here play the first DS game of hers? I think that was, or one of my, first DS games ever 🥹. I was 5 or 6, at the time 🥰
So, Peach can have a sword, can have kunai, and can punch a guy into oblivion. But a revolver is just too much.  Uh huh. Okay. As if kids are gonna wanna commit fun violence because Cowgirl Peach is packing a six-shooter.
Alpha is going to be really happy about this game
Sorry Mario but Princess Peach is my new favorite hero
Ninja peach looks so beautiful and cool❤
I'm so getting this game.
Next Smash should be interesting.
I love how peach's detective outfit was based on detective baby rosalina's
Is her voice actress different? Seems more mature
Does Peach sound… different to anyone?
This will be peak fiction
0:40 AMELIA WATSON HERSELF!! 😮😮😮
Princess Peach is better than any Disney princess, and so much better than Barbie
Want. Must have
Employee: "So we are making a Princess Peach game. What kind of genre do we want?" Other Employee: "ALL OF THEM" Employee: "...What do you mean all o..."
Ninja Peach is dope.
Another princess who become a ninja. Cool.
This looks way better than the Peach game that released on the DS back in the mid 2000s.
Swordfighter peach is everything
Commenting on every NoA YouTube upload until Nintendo rolls back or significantly changes their community tournament guidelines  Comment # 128  If you have other ideas on how to share my thoughts with Nintendo (because yes, I do recognize over 100 comments in they probably won’t listen to a repeated comment), I am open to suggestions.   Prior Suggestions + Current Status: ) Write a letter to Nintendo - Sent, awaiting reply. Contents of the letter can be found in the first reply. ) Email Nintendo - Currently procrastinating (look this time I actually have been busy, I swear) ) Call Nintendo Support - Still considering effectiveness, leaning towards not worth it ) Make death threats? - Can’t believe I have to say this, but absolutely not, please nobody do this   TLDR on my stance; I am not against there being guidelines, I just think the current ones aren't good and could be changed for the better.
How does this woman get kidnapped....?
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
We need sworsfight and Kung Fu Peach in the smash
Just ninja looks princess awesome, Nice, music.  It wasn't the kind of Princess game I expected.  I was waiting for Princess Peach RPGS.  This is just mini game Mario Party.  Maybe it's good game.  Show more gameplay.
I want Detective Peachachu!
Female kids game
FINNALY SHES DEFENDING HERSELF!!! about god damn time!
Why the f* she doesn't have teeth, Nintendo? 🤔
Not a fan of the deeper voice but cant wait to play this game ❤
They got a pretty good person to be Peach's stunt double, I mean, they look almost exactly like Peach!
They’re doing a really specific job of quickly not showing much gameplay for each, huh…
I stilll don’t get what the game will be like. Like, what time of game is it? A bunch of micro games?
I legit want amiibo of all her outfits.
I think I speak for everyone of Us when I say we all much rather have got the opportunity to enjoy Reverse-Cowgirl Peach instead 😢
Bowser will have a very difficult time kidnapping the princess next time.
where's the "Prostitute Peach" outfit?
*WE NEED THESE PEACH OUTFITS ON MARIO KART TOUR ASAP*
This game remenber Puppeeter (PS3)
Nintendo not waiting for a Direct to showcase is very very telling of a new console announcement by March
Why does this game look kinda fire
I can't wait to get that game!
Nice touch to have Cowgirl Peach hold tomato juice instead of whiskey or beer.  I thought we were gonna see her  handle alcohol for the first time since Super Mario Kart lol
I keep seeing people (mainly aggressive anti-woke types) claim that her face was redesigned to resemble the movie, but I just don't see it. She looks like the same old Princess Peach to me.
Moveset potential for the next Smash game.
Definitely no direct in February
Those costumes are FIRE! I can't wait to see Peach in action when the game releases! 🥰🔥
Detective Peach-achu
I was already thinking about getting this game after the last trailer, but now, I’m going to try and get it when it comes out.
When's Nintendo gonna actually explain what the gameplay is?!
I JUST GOT BACK FROM COLLEGE TODAY AND SAW THIS OMG 😍😍😍😍
Seems fun, although clearly aimed at a very young audience.
Idk the whole experience looks inconsistent .
This Peach is a Ninja! This Peach is a Cowgirl! This Peach does Kung Fu!  I'm just (Ken) Mario!
it looks good, not into that voice for peach though, doesnt really sound like her
Man this game can't come soon enough, this will definitely be hit in 2024.
Sooo... has Peach's voice retired too? Because I can't hear HER in this
Peach is becoming Kirby.
It looks more like there's going to be levels specific to each outfit with each getting its own mechanics and not outfits with puzzles/challenges you can solve with Multiple outfits
R34 is about to have a field day
Peach is my favourt princess. now i cant wait for the game to be released!
Ninja and Cowboy, but no Pirate? How sad.
Peach.
My daughter, who is going to be 2 when this comes out might love this. She has a bit of Peach stuff and whenever we visit Super Nintendo World she gets so excited to see Peach. She calls her name out with much enthusiasm. So I'm going to buy this for her and play it for her or she may want to play herself 😂
Soooo....Peach is now the Barbie of Nintendo?
Cowgirl Peach, huh? There’s a rule 34 joke there, but that's beneath me.
Will Mario be there
Oh excitement just reached whole new levels!!! I can’t wait for this game!! This will be Peach’s finest hour!!
All her transformations confirmed I can't wait to play
Peach looks good but it looked like the actual gameplay looks like it plays itself. My guess is there will be 3 buttons used lol
Lowkey reminds me of the third Ape Escape, not gonna lie...am I going to play it for the same reason? Release it and the reviews will speak for themselves
Well, amount of r34 Peach pics has just multiplied by 6
I Guess Amy Rose didn't have her own game
Switch 2 september 24th guys
Yay more rule 34
What's that? *_Ninja_* Peach?  I'm sold on this game now.
Dang, I thought this was gonna be an E game, not an E+10.
it seems there might not be a direct now.. we are getting all these trailers...  Mario Vs Dk and now Peach and Nintendo just might do trailers for the rest of Q1...
Who else would rather this game be about daisy
March 22 can’t come fast enough
I do hope there are more transformations in game then what we see in this trailer!
My favorite is Sword fighter Peach, ninja Peach, and cowgirl Peach. Which one is your guys favorite?
Reminds me of ffv job system! And ninja peach looks the best! Love it!
This is going to be a must play for the game grumps
The trailer spoils the other two costumes but it's good to see more of this game. I'm happy they aren't changing her face to match the Mario Bros. movie.
Love Cowgirl Peach
*C O W G I R L   P E A C H 🤠*
it's been 19 years ago, finally..
She’s like a Barbie doll/ Disney princess now.
Ninja Peach... a little on the nose with the whole "fruit ninja" thing, Nintendo.
All these transformations look amazing, can't wait to try them out when the game releases
this isn't something i'm really interested in, but its very promising that next time a Smash Bros game comes out Peach is gonna get a massive overhaul.
Badass peach 🍑😮😊
I just can't wait to play Nintendo's version of PS3's Puppeteer!
Petition for Nintendo to make a game with Princess Daisy as the main character
Princess peach is like the barbie of Nintendo she can be anything
peach Joseph joestar
Too bad its only Nintendo. I don't support Nintendo games anymore.
Cowgirl Peach look's like she friend with Applejack.
looks life a nintendo land
I was talking with her voice actor last summer, and I could only express my excitement for this game!
You had me at "Ninja Peach."
Hopefully this trailer is a sign that we'll get a new TTYD trailer soon.
i have an intresting question could any mario characters hold their own film
Come on ...slap in the face to DK , starfox , metroid fans etc
What a queen, I can't wait to play this game❤
You know how old you are if you get the music reference in the first ninja stage
Peach's powers are more Kirby than  Mario. Game looks great still
You’ve yee’d your last haw
Prince of Persia vs Princess Of Mushroom Kingdom
I just wish Peach still had her high pitched voice. Doesn't sound like her without it :(
This will be very fun to play as different peaches in outfits
Princess 🅱️each
Oh look, a video game with a strong and independent female protagonist, and the Twitter Freaks still won't like it!   That actually means it's a great game!
Am I the only one that thinks this looks awful WTF 💀
Idk why but this is giving me 3d world vibes!!
I wanna play this already, and I HOPE they do something similar with Zelda someday!!
Swordfighter Peach and Kung Fu Peach are peak designs
Huh such weird sounding voice direction.
She's gonna be OP in the next Smash Bros.
It’s kinda funny. I thought to myself “how can you make a video game with a female lead when women belong in the kitchen?” Then the next minute I see pastry chef Peach and start laughing… very clever Nintendo.
Dose this mean mario aint gonna rescue for the billion time ? If that the case then mario just fightig bowser to save da world ig
The detective boss fight should be like danganronpa trials
Damn, paper mario lookin crazy
Sheriff peach or bounty hunter peach is better than cowgirl peach lol, she ain't no ranch hand she's the law lol
😲SHINOBI!?
(Gasp loudly) (singing): “Peaches x10 I LOVE YOOOOOUUU!!!”
The more I see this game the more I’d like to get it.
With all these new outfits, I wouldn't be surprised if she were to get a line of action figures or fashion dolls in the near future.
That sound in the beginning.... Mario 3 reference?  Action Cue?
nintendo should give gamefreak a creativity and technical excelence course.
I still don't get this game? Minigames? Mini stages? What kind of game is it?
I'm ready for all these peaches to make their way to Super Smash Bros.
Sam Kelly sounds way different than she normally does. It's gonna be interesting hearing her cover a wider range of emotions
Peach is Nintendo's Barbie. I love it!
What is Peach's Voice?.
1:10 If Princess Peach Showtime takes place in a theater, doesn’t that mean she’s faking it? She’s doesn’t have any skills? Or maybe it’s a reference to Super Mario Bros. 3, I don’t know.
Why did they change her facial features?! I’m so sick of the bad a** chick. Ugh.
I love that each outfit has a unique remix of the same music theme.
Japanese, American, French, British, French again, Chinese
You know, this game could have been a first start for Wapeach's first antagonistic role alongside Wario & Waluigi instead of the Wicked Grape, similar to Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. Think about it, Wapeach alongside her gang and her own minions (Shy Guys perhaps?)show up and try to upstage Peach at the Theater, maybe even trying to replace her as ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom. As much as I can agree that Wapeach's original design is not really the best and is more similar to Time Bokan's Majo, I am a sucker for the terrible trio trope and would have like to see more story scenarios with the Wa-Trio.  However, does anyone like the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch designs enough to remember or draw fan art of them for long?
This game gives me Kirby and the forgotten world vibes, gonna be a nice game!
glad you kept the classic look, been looking forward to this
This all looks so great! This game has the potential to be extremely varied and creative. Also Detective Peach looks adorable
Hmm. Think this is all the costumes/roles Peach can assume in this game, or is there even more not yet revealed?
The beginning of the Cowgirl theme almost sounded like the Molduga battle...
Can't wait for Prostitute Peach!
I am really excited for this. As a 30 year old guy i'm definitely in the target demo.
We Have princess peach before GTA6 🥶👌
*R34 artists have entered the chat*
Cool i want to play this game now look very entertaining
early!
No bowset or anything with some skin? Give the people what they want nintendo
I'm just glad that Princess Peach has a solo game of her own once again. Never imagined I'd be seeing her as a ninja or a cowgirl.
No puedo esperar para ver esto en el Super Jueves
Considering how long games like this usually are I would not be surprised if this is every transformation in the game or all but one.
Well done nintendo, you copy pasted sonys ape escape 3, right down to the transformations. Good for you!
How about a Princess Daisy game?
Shadversity must be MAD now that Nintendo went FULL WOKE and gave Peach EVEN MORE PANTS
palworld got um nervous
Lets see if Nintendo is less sexist this time lol emotional super powers lol
Now she can become a cowgirl and a ninja too? This game is shaping up to be awesome! So nice that they're giving Peach another game to show what she's capable of.
When did peach get a new voice???
Seems to me that 'Ninja Peach' and 'Kung-Fu Peach' are a bit too similar; they could easily have gone with a different, non martial-arts theme for one of those. (Not that this doesn't look cool - it does - it's just that I see wasted possibilities for it being even cooler. What about Pilot Peach, in a Red Baron-style biplane? Or Adventure Peach, in an Indy-or-Lara-esque get-up? Space Peach, Scientist Peach, Dancing Peach, Archer Peach - oh, the sky would have been the limit with this one.)
Sure would like to see at least one of these alternate looks for the next Super Smash Bros. game.    In fact, one of these could be a new Final Smash for her.
Please Nintendo port Far Cry 3 or Oblivion to the switch.
Naruto Peach!
I just heard that Samantha Kelly is still voicing Peach in this game. Shame because I would have actually bought it if someone else was voicing her. Hopefully this is Kelly's last game as Peach before a new person voices her. I want Jen Taylor to return.
This game looks decent ngl
Me going to my mom: MOM Mom: WHAT?  Me: can you pre-order princess peach showtime Mom: sure!
Whilst i do love that peach is getting more love, it kinda feels like they might just be doing this to be able to have more filler in mario kart
YES PRE-ORDERS,
I will buy it
I hope it gets challenging, it looks creative but easy
Oh wow this looks super cool
Princess Peach: Pink Precipitation.
0:52 cooking mama?
Her new Final Smash will be awesome in future SSB games!😂😂😂
Yessss!!!! I can’t wait to play princess peach again! I completed super princess peach when I was a kid, now all the years of waiting for another princess peach game will pay off when I get the game!
Gente o jogo do trilênio.................
Why are there Olimar clones on the set?
That’s it? It only had 6 transformations for Peach? I was expecting 8 transformations.
LOOKS LIKE A SHANTAE GAME! I really needed. This will be a great game, I hope this game surpass Super princess peach
She’s so cool
Okay they’ve shown new trailers of 2 of the 3 known games to come out in 2024 from Nintendo. There will be a direct in February, for sure. So are they making sure these trailers are out there so they focus on Nintendo Switch 2 in the direct?? Its weird.
Clearly peach took some inspiration from her fellow smash bros combatants
Hmm, I'm wondering how many stages there will be Like will each stage be centered around one? Or will there be more transformations outside of this trailer?
Reverse Cowgirl Peach looks interesting.
I hope the actual game has a better framerate than this video. Might have though, as many Nintendo trailers have been in lower framerate before release
The graphics look like a gamecube game. Poor…
Man, This game looks really dang exciting and I'm looking forward to it!
If Peach is so capable then why’s she always locked up in Bowser’s castle?
If we ever get another Smash this game should be the inspiration for Peach! That would make her a pretty interesting fighter!!
I wonder if there is an Archer transformation for Peach. Guess we'll wait and see.
I hate her new voice
I just wanna say the voice actor did a amazing job
This looks so delightful! So glad we're getting more Peach
0:08 EXCUSE ME!? SHINOBI PEACH IS REAL AND I FREAKING CALLED IT AFTER WE SAW THE FIRST TRAILER WITH KUNG FU PEACH????? AIN'T NO WAYYYY 😭🙌🏻💚💚💚💚💚💚
Princess Peach Showtime! reminds me of Kirby with all of the transformations.
Why are so many Olimars there
The legends of peach, can't wait to explore :)
Peach is the new Barbie. She can do anything. Be anything.
If she ever gets kidnapped again after this, it’s practically canon that she lets herself get captured for the fun of it!
Please give us a treehouse playthough of this game. It would make or break the game for me knowing how vast the levels of this game are.
Next Smash Game Gonna Have All These Peach Skins Just Watch.
I love this
Peach over here thinking  "You know, mario has been working so hard all these years saving me (and saving the entire gaming industry that one time) I think I should take some of the weight off his shoulders and help carry the burden"
Not a big fan of the new voice direction but everything else looks great!!
So much fun cosplay potential
Comes out the same day Dragon's Dogma 2 does. Might just have to get both 🤷‍♂️
oh no.. they changed her voice
I hope we get a Captain Peach transformation. I would love to see her firing cannonballs and undergoing general swashbuckling similar to her Swordfighter form, just with a but of high-seas finesse.
Po has some competition
Kirby ripoff 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
... Why does this feel like Nintendo saw Ballan Wonderland and told us to hold their sake?
Nintendo is just coming out with bangers for the mario characters
Is it just me or does Peach sound different? Also, makes me wonder will this game have full voice acting
Peach is Nintendo's Barbie confirmed
So, is this an actual game or just a bunch of assorted Mini Games?
Me: *thinking we have only 4 Peach transformations* Nintendo: BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!!
Really wish each individual clip was a little longer, so they could show a little more of each costume's stages. Game looks delightful, can't wait! Would love to see a treehouse showcase.
As a Texan, Cowgirl Peach is extremely epic.
I'm LOVING this new tone for Peach!!!! I heard someone say it's still Samantha Kelly providing the voice lines, and I hope that's indeed the case! It might mean they'll be heading in this direction for future recordings 💝   btw deep voiced girls can still be demure pure and uwu or whatever y'all consider it, because voice pitch doesn't change that
...She has both Kung Fu and Ninja forms.  I might actually try this!  0w0
Princess Peach it's SHOWTIME! 🌃🏯⛩️🏜👸🏼🕵🏼‍♀️🥷🏻👘👢🌟
Nice! This game reminds me of The Great Circus Mystery starring Mickey & Minnie
Neat! Can't wait to play!
This is great I’m gonna go google cowgirl peach right now
Is this a sequel to the super princess peach game on the ds?
I'd suggest giving Rosalina a game set in space. That would be pretty fun!
Barbie: Be who you wanna be!  Peach: Hold my whiskey, pilgrim.
In terms of gameplay, I'm getting a Luigi's Mansion feel. The stage-like camera angle is the sure-sign of that, so I assume PP:S will be about exploration, puzzle-solving, and light combat.
i forgot this was coming
Looks like Movie Peach is rubbing off on game Peach in terms of badassery.  This game seems like a definite buy - I just hope it doesn't fall flat on its face.
I would or preferred super princess peach 2, the moods fit better than the costume gimmick
OH!! NO WAY!! Peach is a ninja too!? Well, have plenty of ideas for cosplay fans The game already looks like fun, looking forward to it!!
Holy this stuff is goated. nice work Nintendo can't wait
This game looks pretty neat, but I still don't know what it is. 😅
I love how some of her costumes matches with some of Mario's outfits in odyssey Patissiere Peach: Cheff Mario Cowgirl Peach: Cowboy Mario Ninja Peach: Samurai Mario
Mommy? Sorry  Mommy? Sorry  Mommy? Sorry  Mommy? Sorry
bowser need a new game like m&l inside story
Hope this game is good got high hopes for it
thanks mr nintendo, now draw her writing romantic letters to daisy
Now I think Bowser gonna think twise before kidnapping Peach if hé dosen't want to take some karate in the face
am i the only one who, when seeing cow girl peach's animation, is reminded of the infamous jp peach win screen where she get drunk?
Peach for Hokage
Peach is being Barbiefied.(Given every job under the sun)
Nintendo maybe a low-budget thrifty slightly poor tightwads win it comes to fishing out money in originality when it comes to making  games but man do they use what they have to make them good despite not having much
I really hope Peach wears these outfits in the next Super Smash Bros game.
0:42 Wow, Peach is cosplaying Amelia Watson from Hololive.
Ninja peach looks so cool
Okay I'm done
Game looks so good :)
It still feels like Mario has gotten more costumes than her!
So glad Peach is finally getting the attention she deserves💖💝
My girl is finally getting her own game again
Looks pretty fun, I'm only worried it might not have a serious difficulty level for me to really enjoy it...  I'll probably still buy it though
Peach Detective looks so sexy
1:03 Me 😨 -  What the heck is this ? Am I supposed to believe that you know ''bujitsu'' ?   😏Princess Peace - Sayonara Sucker
Peach has come a long way from the original SMB, from Damsel in Distress to this game's equivalent of a FREAKING SHAPESHIFTER.  Also, I'm super hyped for this game
This is the definition of a girlboss
Oh I'm so buying this game when it comes out.
Cowgirl Peach is now my favorite of these transformations (ok sword-fighter Peach may still be my fav idk)
Ninja peach is tuff
Next smash game is gonna go crazy with peach's moveset
March 22nd Can't come soon enough!
Looks good
Damn, why wouldn't Peach just save herself from Bowser then if she can do all this?
so, what genre is this? a beatemup with light platforming? a linear 3d platformer like 3d world?
Kuniochi and Jessie.
Please explain to me why this game looks actually creative and fun
Hollywood and their talentless minions must be salivating to see a new, potential character they could destroy.
I don't know man this looks like a bunch of minigames and tech demos turned into a game. Seems more like an experiment than a fleshed out game.
Hear me out. What if in the next Smash, Peach uses the different forms she take in this game?
Cowgirl Peach 😏
Peach for hire
Sometimes I’m a wall jumping ninja, sometimes I’m a daring cowgirl, sometimes I’m a brave knight, but who am I really?? PEACH FLASH!!!
I feel like the detective part is going to be so hard but the rest looks so cool
Just looks fun!
Can’t we please just more info & trailer for Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD or Paper Mario the thousand-year door? We barely know anything about those games and instead we Get trailers for Mario Vs Donkey kong and Princess Peach showtime which we already knew a lot about
I am not a fan of Peach, but this looks really fun.
DLC in the later future what’s your bets?
New Peach VA? Fell off 😭
I am so getting this!
My little girl is going to FLIP when she sees me get this game. Can’t wait to play it with her.
i am so confused as to what this game is about and how it plays, still excited for it
Peach why you sound different?! 0_O
I'm glad this isn't just a role swap like Super Princess Peach, but I hope Bowser and the Mario brothers are at least referenced in some way. It would be cool if the new villain possesses Bowser or uses a Bowser puppet like King Boo did in the first Luigi's Mansion.
If shes tha capable why she gets kidnapped
Imagine what this means for Peach in the next SSB
Maybe they’ll be alternate costumes for the next Smash
I’m gonna wait for more vids. It kinda looks a little boring. Peach is cute though.
Our princess is cooking (no pun intended)big time! There's more transformation?!?!?!
Is princess peach voice sound,s weird
this trailer came out of nowhere
Finally
Peach sounds like she has some new voice lines which definitely threw me off O_o  seems like after Wonder Nintendo finally decided to start letting people make more voice lines for our favorite characters, now I'm actually kind of excited for this!
Ninja Peace 🗡️ show me your ninjutsu
Very curious on why the E10+ rating
Amazing!!! But wait is peach voice sounds different?
Her costumes remind me of Ape Escape 3 costumes, which are cool
She's gonna have the nastiest moveset in the next Smash Bros.
Wario Master of desguise but with Peach Jump in the hype train now
Am I the only one who thinks she sounding a bit like Rosalina here?
Oh, goddesses, I really hope this game *plays* well, too, because it's sure got the aesthetics down.
New Peach voice? Anyways, this still looks amazing! Glad to see Peach get her own game again after more than a decade!
I foresee someone calling this the Princess Peach Dress-Up Game.  Mostly because I just did.  :P
Idk man, this still feels unpolished, maybe they announced too early. I hope they can have this improved.
Cowgirl Peach just hits different 🍑😎
This is a kirby game but peach is the main character😭
This game looks very easy, like a game for a beginner. I hope I'm dead wrong
Forget Nintendo ninjas,  we got Peach ninjas
Bowser gotta head up  if he wants to kidnapp her in the next game
Awesome I love ninja peach
If another smash bros happen this peach must have the moveset with all classes. You can choose the same way you choose monado type
Oh my god 😫
Ha bet bowser won't kidnap her again
Day 1 buy for me looks awesome
59 day 2 month left, before princess peach: showtime release.
I'm still a bit confused about what this game... is, I guess? Is it a 3D platformer? Action adventure? It looks fun, but I don't really know what to expect from the gameplay.
So where’s Peach’s six shooters if she’s a Cowgirl?
I wish cowgirl peach was real...  Joke aside, this game looks amazing. Another thing, does peach have two voices actors?
Cool, but when are we getting a TTYD release day?
She sounds so different.
@Personthatexists bro, just don't buy the game if you hate everything about it
To me, it looks like its gonna be many themed stages that is basic puzzle/platforming but mainly just mini games. I guess we shall see soon.
0:04 Kuno-Peachy!
NO DIRECT IN JANUARY FOLCS 💀
On x/Twitter they wrote that there will also be pastel pink Joycons.
I hope she has these costumes in the next smash game.
Imagine what they can do with Daisy's voice. If Peach can be an action Princess, then Daisy can be that action skater rocker wild gal.
I'm super excited for this game but also scared it might turn out to be another Balan wonderland. Here's to hoping
I had feeling that there was going to be more costumes. Maybe we'll see even more when the game officially comes out.
Kung-Fu Peach! 🤩
This is SO worth the qait after Super Princess Peach for the DS long ago
Damn Peach is Balling
I can already see it now. A potential future Smash game will incorporate this game’s elements into Peach’s moveset, and Daisy will be her own character with Peach’s original moveset and no longer be an echo fighter. Now we just need a game with Waluigi as a major character (either his own, or one with him and Wario together) and he’ll definitely get his chance someday.
I'll give this game a chance despite how girly it looks. Actually it looks interesting.
So it's basically like a solo Mario Party with bunch of minigames? Looks cute but will most likely take 3h to beat with a $60 price tag.
I already liked the fact that they are giving more prominence to Peach with her own game again and with mechanics that match the character and all these transformations are very beautiful and suit her including the music, if I were to put it in a ranking of My favorites would be Kung Fu, Ninja, Cowgirl, Swordfighter, Patissiere and Detective
Is it Just Me, Or Has Peach Had Gone to Puberty?
Nintendo, for the love of Arceus, put this ninja Peach in Smash
:-)yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssss
Peach sounds completely different now too.
I’m kinda disappointed that Cowgirl Peach doesn’t have a cap gun.
Well those are the new moves for the next smash games
Cowgirl Peach is my #1
imagine in the next smash peach becomes a sword fighter         sora isnt a sword fighter hes a keyblader
This looks like a collection of mini-games.
If you think about it...Her Outfits complement Mario's ones From Super Mario Odyssey so like Miyamoto said Nintendo Characters can be versatile in any situation or funny.
I know tomato juice is a thing but would it have been too much to give Cowgirl Peach a soda, root beer or sarsaparilla for a bit more rugged and tough, I know we are talking about a very kid friendly "tough" but you can still have fun with the wild west setting without making it super mild, cork guns and suction cup arrows, that sort of thing.

I know this is unrelated to the video but Personthatexists needs to be deleted or Blocked from this channel. All he does is Spread negativity and not offer any Valid points.
Why does this game look so mid
I wonder how long it'll take for this game to leak online 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This better be an amazing game, Nintendo-
Adding a unique font text for each peach type would've been nice it is her first game 😭
This looks like its going to be a sort of variety mini games/adventure/beat em up weird mix type of game, but i dont say that like its a bad thing. Its been a loooong while since peach deserved her own solo game since super princess peach. Also im not the only one tinking about "Be whatever you want to be" barbie slogan can i? cause peach can be anything she wants and rocks it. cant wait for this game to come out
Still want a ballerina Peach transformation.
Been waiting for more info on this one. Man I feel the cosplay scene for this game is gonna be good.
...Is it just me, or does Peach have a different voice in this game?
I like how everyone forgot they changed the box art to her Mario movie appearance instead of her original one 🤣 Attention span of a goldfish: current social media
Did peach get a new VA? her voice sounds deeper.
0:24 Is that the horse in breath of the wild?🕵
Looks incredible!
What's next? A costume in which Peach wacks enemies with her hair?
Now they have to sell each transformation as a plushy!!🤙
Can we please get a full game of just Patissiere Peach? 🍰🍑
Not exactly the same but the Kung Fu Peach pillar scene makes me think of Sly 3 General Tsao fight on top of bamboo
This looks really cool,  recalls SMB2 when she could float.. my girls will love this too
Samantha Kelly Voice Princess Peach, Toads and Toadette she's still amazing and wonderful voice ever!🤩👍❤️ I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL GAME!😃👍❤️
Am I the only one who noticed the change in Peach’s voice?
She's SO cute! I'm so excited!
Being on a stage destroys the atmosphere for me.. I‘d have loved the game if Peach would be in the real locations for example when she‘s ninja peach and crawling around in a real ninja village at night and not on stage..
So who was the dude in the pitch meeting that said "what if this spinoff DIDN'T star Kirby this time?" that or the usual person who turns everything to Kirby was sick that day.  Also some low-key Sonic vibes for some reason, but I can't explain it, not the gameplay... just vibes.
Interesting, I wonder who the voice actress is this time. It sounds lower than normal, maybe to match movie peach?
Just release that Swordfighter Peach amiibo and take my money!
Amazing!
Okay but what is Peach roping in tomato juice/possibly ketchup for? Who is out here stealing either of those?
Now we need Secret Agent WaLuigi with metal gear solid like gameplay 🎉😮
Wait if Ninja Princess peach and i modded my consoles then, OH NO
I'm really excited for this game with how much it's giving Peach the spotlight in her own game! As I'm loving the look of the Ninja and Cowgirl transformations for Peach in this trailer.
There's gonna be 10 transformations right?
W Peach!
Peach belongs in the kitchen
Please don’t be a baby game for babies. -crossing fingers-
Mario fans continue to eat good
Weird. I would have figured they would announce the new costumes in a future direct. Either there won't be a February direct this year or there is going to be announcements regarding the next console.
...Why would you give Peach a Gun Holster, if your not gonna give her one to use? ._.
The fact that this video just uploaded today, which also happens to be my birthday, I’m glad I got this as a present from Nintendo themselves.
You guys make me and my friends arguing over the SNES vs Genesis in 1993 look cool.
Good morning Barbie!
❤
Princess Peach where she transformed into any role in this game is pretty much like the modern Minky Momo at this point.
SWORD PEACH SHE HAS A SWORD LET'S GOOOOOO
Got a feeling Detective Peach is gonna be my personal favorite. Love figuring out puzzles in detective mode.
Princess Peach SHowtime is the new Super Princess Peach
Ooh, she is so brilliant with all those different moves! I can't wait to try this out! 😁
AAAA!! This looks incredible, I need this game now!💖
1:01 Kung Fu Panda Reference! Peach Style
0:17 Mmm, Peach's voice sounds a little different to me, if the game starts I'll see if Peach's voice hasn't been changed
Hope they fix whatever is going on with the voice by launch. Strangely patisserie peach sounds normal.
The outfits very are cool and all, but the music for this game seems really good so far 🔥
Garbage
Wait this looks REALLY fun... no... I don't wanna... but...
no direct....
All of these need to be costumes for Peach in the next Smash Bros.
Peach for Senran Kagura
guys ... i think i may have to ask for cowgirl peach' hand in marriage 😳
you're already a princess, no need to put everyone else out of a job XD
Yeyeyeye
It looks like Peach is finally getting her own game instead of Mario trying to save her.
I’m so excited to see Peach in a new game after Super Princess Peach! She deserves the spotlight again. Happy about seeing Ninja and Cowgirl too
This game looks like so much fun, I’m happy Peach is getting the limelight again
This is cool now make a waluigi game
In the distance you can hear an angry Australian, seeing that Peach indeed does wear pants
Detective Peachkachu!
All of these transformations look AWESOME! Peach is really slaying the stage here!
I REALLY LOVE NINJA PEACH 😍🤩
The only good outfit is the bakery one.
Weird game. I’ll wait on the reviews for this.
Ah yes, the ole' metroidvania/point-and-click/puzzler schtick. That ole' gem.
NOOOO why the lower voice??! 😭 I've always loved her sweet voice
i actually rlly wanna play this
Huh, two new transformations.  I would have settled for just the ones shown first, but I will NOT say no to Ninja or Cowgirl Peach.
This game looks really fun! Love all the costume designs and playstyles too.
I wonder how many more Princess Peach transformations there's going to be once the full game releases since these are ones we already know that are coming.
This makes her look like the secret daughter of Barbie and Big Jim.
0:18 The new Undertale Yellow dlc is looking fire
Peach is now Jessie from toy story...sweet
Espero que sean niveles completos y no minijuegos como los de Wario 🤨
I forgot about this game
She only sounded natural as Patissiere Peach.
Did peach voice change? (She sounds like Daisy)
I hear "Danger" is Daisy's middle name.🧐
Any reason for getting rid of all your voice actors that are still alive, willing, and able?
0:07 Is it Me? or is Peach The Green Ninja. 0:18 Peach's Roundup Come on It's time play. 1:03 Everybody is Kung fu fighting.
COOL BUT WHY DID THEY THINK THAT HAVING ARIAL BLACK AS *THE* FONT FOR THE GAME WAS A GOOD IDEA
Ninja Peach looks the best, imo 🥷🍑
I love how peach has changed she is still the princess but she is also much more
it's already lagging in the trailer smh
People are gonna go crazy y’all know why
She sounds… different.
Ninja Peach debe salvar al mundo de Mortal Kombat.... Y derrotar a la malvada Kronika...
So is this Wario: Master of Disguise again? Because that sounds great. Also "Cowgirl peach" may lead to some google issues.
I still don't understand the game at all. Is it a collection of mini levels with a different theme?
Nah people were saying artists were about to go crazy when Mario Wonder revealed with the elephant powerup, Elephant Peach art implied, but Nintendo's dropping THIS bro all the Peach outfits, but the game does look very nice 🔥  Her voice though lol
I can see the fanart already.
All these transformations of Peach is really fun to see. My favorites would have to be Cowboy and Kung Fu. I’m happy Nintendo is giving her more opportunities and a stronger personality
Dragon's Dogma 2 or Princess Peach Showtime on the same day... Now that's a difficult decision right there!   Especially since I don't have a PlayStation 5 or a Switch!
i still have no idea what kind of game this is 😂
Nice to have a game where Peach isn’t a damsel
My most awaited game of 2024!
Yo Ninja Peach is fire
Really like the Ninja and Cowgirl transformations.  To all of you whining about the voice, It’s still Samantha Kelly.  When Princess Peach transforms, Her personality changes.
Am I the only one who think this looks like an imitation of Kirby?
Princess peach is now a ninja and cowgirl in play. If was outside of acting Bowser would be hogtied and beaten by her ninja skills.
We all know peach is useless. Stop trying to pretend shes a good character
Es la princesa Peach...  Es tan cool 😎🆒....
This is extremely refreshing!
Her voice is different, right?
This game might actually be really fun🔥🔥🙏🏽
Mario 3 vibes with the curtains and stage play theme. 👌
That's it I NEED THIS GAME.
Man...Peach fanart aboutta go CRAZY on Twittet 🥰🥰🥰
Llegó la hora de rule 34
Now there’s a ninja Peach Naruto fans eat your hearts out
Ninja peach looks pretty intimidating 😳 👀. I like it!
Why does peach sound weird
Peach's voice is different
Please don't tell me they changed Peach's voice because that's brutal 😢
The game isn't even out yet and there's already people complaining about Peach's voice. You can never please the Nintendo fanbase.
0:10 DO NOT GO INTO THE TALL GRASS, YOU MAY ENCOUNTER A POKEMON
Like the Ninja, Cowgirl, & Swirdfighter Peach.  BTW Swordfighter Peach makes up Warrior Peach from Skylanders SuperChargers before Bowser & Donkey Kong passed.
First 4 transformations was revealed in the direct now 2 more transformations been reveal we are missing 4 more transformations
I don’t care if I’m getting ahead of myself here, if they have any plans for a new smashboa down the line, all of these outfits need to be variants for Peach.
Cowgirl Peach saying "Howdy There" was adorable, just to cute for my waifu
Gee
My favorite costume of peach has to be the swordfighter she looks so cool in it very excited for this game
if she is this athletic and talented, why doesn't she use all that against bowser everytime she gets captured?
Peach taking notes from Kirby
Who else is excited if you aren't dont comment or like please
Gonna take some time to get used to this Peach VA
Oooh,so it's gonna be like the warioland series transformations???
We want soccer player peach!
They added Ninja and Cowboy for Peach?NIIIIIIICE!!!
Q rico we
Where is magical girl peach!?
это мы ждём, дочка будет в восторге
Hehehe look at me go~ ☺️
Now this reminds me on the theory that every mario game is just Mushroom kingdom Propaganda
I can just see Nintendo selling all of this different Peach dolls in the different outfits little girls like Barbie.
PC new now ?
This is great...Daisy game please
the drip is insane
i still have no idea what to think about this game every trailer just leaves me with "yeah that sure is a game that exists" the gameplay looks so... slow? i hope the game ends up being good because the concept of a new peach game sounds cool it's been so long since super princess peach
Save a horse, ride a cowgirl!
My guess for other costumes: For a sailing level: Sailor or Pirate For an aquatic level: Mermaid or Diver For a haunted/horror-themed area: Witch, Vampire, or Mad Scientist For a prehistoric/jungle-themed area: Cavegirl For a medieval/fantasy-themed area: Knight For a music-themed level: Singer, Idol, or Rock Star For a sci-fi-themed area: Superhero or Cyborg
Mario is a big fan of Cowgirl Peach.
Fanart of Ninja Peach hanging out with Shiek 3, 2, 1...
Glad we're getting a new peach game after the last one released almost *20* years ago.
Peach has new voice direction, I like it
I like how they give her something that’s nice for her Rosalina is a space person, daisy is a sporty person and peach is a acrobatic moving about person like in the movie.
Ohh 😌
New Peach voice actor?
They took the "be who you wanna be" to a whole new level
*SPECTACULAR!!! 100/100!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩*
guys! this trailer means that we're not going to get a switch direct in february
Cowgirl Peach would belong in a western movie.
Switch 2 information + reveal plz
Dude, the font of the letters in the game and the clothes looks like princess peach is joining the precure.
This is going to be good
Wooooooow I like Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach can't wait to play this game
What if detective Peach meets detective Pikachu.
Here’s some versions I’d like for Peach: masked wrestler Peach, construction worker Peach, knight in shining armor Peach, pop star Peach, rock and roll Peach, hip hop Peach, vampire Peach, ghost (Boo) peach, bodybuilder (muscle) Peach, surfer Peach, sailor Peach, 50 foot (giantess) Peach, robo Peach, wild (jungle) Peach.
Sakurai: WRITE THAT DOWN! WRITE THAT DOWN!!!
New va for Peach?
So 3/22 is the release date. Better save up now and get two copies (one digital, one physical).
Princess Peach Shippuden!
Ninja and Redne. . .i mean, Cowgirl confirmed, and no sign of Pink Gold. Good.
Ninja Peach is coolest transformation!🥷
This is gonna be good
So obviously the next big Mario Spin-off title will be a Waluigi game right? Haha... RIGHT?
Peach can do anything! What a girlboss she's become!
No need for any plumber anymore
Aw heck yeah! Smash Bros. Peach about to get an overhaul.
I hope for Mermaid Peach Mouse Peach And Toon Peach
Hmm. Peach's new voice actress needs a higher pitch.
Patricio babeando
Peach sounds different... not sure how I feel about it yet, but the game looks interesting.
Balan Wonderworld, take note.
This is why they ended content for Mario Kart Tour The devs didn't want everyone requesting these new potential princesses alts all the time
We’re so close the TTYD remake showing up here soon! I can feel it!
:O
Cool!
Ninja Peach FTW. I wish she had a katana too with her kunais and other stuff for her arsenal
So each play has a different gameplay style  That's actually really cool  I'll for sure get this game, and in time for my birthday (which is on the 27th of march)
Peach cosplayers are eating good this year
MY GIRLS A NINJA NOW AND I LOVE IT
Is it just me, or does Peach sound like she has a different Voice Actor here?
❤ I feel like this was a one hit GameCube title that was forgotten over the years and finally re-released.  It has a very nostalgic feel to it and I’m absolutely here for it.
0:56 good to see Peach back in the kitchen.
The many cosplays of peach
I know one thing I get the game
So does Bowser just get her cute outfits and themed courses for those fits?
Artists...ready?
The OST is fire 🔥
Why does Ninja Peach looks like a Jojo.  I mean, she looks like the female version of Joseph Joestar (and no, I don't mean Tequila Joseph).
Oh lord, Ninja, Swordfighter, and Cowgirl Peach will be the mosy drawn Peaches on the internet
Can't wait to play
This looks so badass.
Why does Peach sound different in this game??
Is this the sequel to Super Princess Peach? Cause it honestly looks pretty fun.
Did they change his voice?
I like this peach a lot but like... why the new voice?
The only thing I'm sort of sad about is the voice change. Everything else looks amazing. Can't wait to play.
this is just a Kirby game
I love Princess Peach! 👑🩷
A man of coulture once  told me. The more peaches the better😈
Every time i see this game im less impressed
I hope Daisy gets some sort of an apparence
You can see Sakurai eyeing Swordfighter Peach.
I just noticed her voice is a bit different in the trailer. How surprising. 🤔
😍😍😍
Interesting
Anyone else notice peach's voice sounds deeper
This looks so cool. Peach finally got her own game after 19 years since Super Princess Peach.
Looks adorable.
Would love to see how it actually works
Peach fans are going crazy right now!
Looks so smooth. Can anyone confirm 60 fps?
Weird to see another game to where peach is the protagonist. The last game I remembered was super princess peach lol
My little girl is so excited for this
This is everything I ever wanted from a Princess Peach game.  10-year-old me is very happy right now.
what a big surprise my favorite one is ninja and patissiere
Peachs’ move set in smash bros is about to go CRAZYY
Surprise announcement: Nintendo releases an amiibo for each Peach costume
Is this game a collection of mini games like Wario ware games or is it a 2.5D platformer?
The bad guys don’t stand a chance against a brawling princess with good costuming!
That’s so awesome 🤩 I can’t wait to get that game and I hope 🤞🏻 there’s even more transformations to, like if there’s a Pirate 🏴‍☠️ Peach or a Secret Spy Peach that’d be so cool 😎, I’m so excited 😆!!!
Ninja Peach has to be my favorite❤❤❤❤❤
doesn't sound like peach at all
Before anyone asks: Yes, the voice of Peach in this game is still Samantha Kelly
What is this voice
I can't wait for March!!!! This is one of my most anticipated games alongside FF7 Rebirth and Suicide Squad!!❤️❤️🥰🔥🔥💯
Enjoy the Spotlight, Peach!
Hope there is more outfits. Love them all so far
Sakurai start taking notes for next Smash! Daisy can continue to use what we’ll consider the old Peach moveset now! Pre ordered this game and glad I did! Looks incredible!  Also no Peachette! Yay!
so no bowsette?
Looks nice, but her voice sounds, deeper?
Sooo cool!!
Sakurai:ok I'm writing it down✍️
Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach just solidified my choice to play this game
I think Arlo was onto something about this being an introductory game for fresh new gamers looking to figure out what genre they like most And you know what, I’m here for that! This game looks charming as heck and I can’t wait to see how it’ll turn out Though my main gripe… If this is going to serve as an introduction for gamers… $60 may be a bit much of a price
Has anybody noticed Peach’s voice sounds different or is it just me?
Almost time to take the stage.
OMG 😱 MY SISTER IS GONNA LOVE ❤️ THIS
YES, HONEY! SLAYIN IN IT AS USUAL 🍑💅✨
Mal posso esperar ❤
Cowgirl peach got me acting all types of unwise
This game is giving me Takarazuka vibes (especially swordfighter peach) and I’m here for it!
NINJA PEACHHHHHHHHH
I still don't know how to feel about this.  It does look and sound very creative & good, tho! I like that Nintendo's trying new things :)
Full cast?
Beautiful game!❤❤
we will be purchasing
Cowgirl Peach is gonna get her Yee Hawd
This game is going to be so cute with its outfits.  Perfect to draw them all.
Peach is the one to get a sword before Mario. Haha! This game is so crazy.
This game going to be perfect
Peach here sounds less...!!  peachy!
They want to drop everything before the direct 😊
This game is gonna be epic
I hope so much that this game will not become a childish mini game collection.
That Peach is a SPY!
Peach's voice sounds off
They change the voice actor?
Why does almost every channel get infested with bots, especially on THIS channels
Is Peach's voice different?
AAAAAAAAAA I’M SO EXCITED!!!! PEACH FANS ARE WINNING SO HARD!!!!!
I guess they finally recasted Peach like they did Mario, Daisy, etc? Because she did not sound like Samantha Kelly was voicing her.
Sick I wasn’t expecting any details until a potential February Direct!! Looks like a charming game!!
slay
Imagine if Peach became Mario Peach.
i only like the 2 Asian Peaches Peaches Peaches.
MARCH 22nd LETS GO!
SICKKK ❤❤❤
Ninja Peach and cowgirl peace confrimed, and they of crouse look amazingb
We need new amiibo nintendo
I'm looking forward to this game. Looks awesome.
I'm still so happy they're finally doing more with Peach, it's been a good while since Super Princess Peach
Why her voice sounds different?
I 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 👑 peach
Alright, now I’m even more hyped!
OK this actually looks really fun I might get it when it comes out
anybody notice peach's voice is a bit different
Can I have it for free nintendo
I am in love with the cowgirl design! I love the western themes!
So it's just a bunch of mini games?
Ayeee!🔥🔥
I smell new final smash potential 👀
Can’t wait for this game!
I can’t wait for Peach to be the star of a fantastic game! May it rival Mario Wonder!
I still like daisy more, but I’m glad that they are giving peach more character. No paper Mario doesn’t count that was about 20 years ago.
If there was a second playable character, who would it be?
Oh my god!
This game has a very cool style, but the gameplay looks to be all over the place - not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but I'd like to get a better idea of it.
Nintendo just spammed me with 4 trailers at the same time. Talk about subliminal messaging about their newest game. lol
I wanna listen to peaches again after this
LET'S GOOOOO
Those transformations are amazing
This is really happening..
This game is going to be so much fun by the looks of it. Can’t wait!!
Can’t wait for Super Princess Peach 2 !!!!
Is that a new voice actor I hear?
WHERE'S SPLATOON 4???
Ninja Peach is so cute 🩷🩷🩷
🍑🍑🍑
What in the realm is this about?
To be honest I'm still struggling to see the gameplay value in this. Kinda seems basic but hoping there's more to it...
W
This game looks amazing. Super excited for March 22nd!
My mom will love
NINJA PEACH, & COWGIRL PEACH, I’M IN WITH IT🤩⭐️💖
My mom will love
I’m so excited for this game
I wonder why they aren't showing this in the next nintendo direct.
COWGIRL PEACH LOOKS AMAZING!!
