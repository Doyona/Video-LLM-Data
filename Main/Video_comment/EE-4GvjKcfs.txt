2025 ? Anyone ? Xd
Fine I’ll replay ragnarok again
PlayStation next channel see marvel Spider-Man 2 PS5&PS4 trailer
Second legendary game let's go
new, yellow, eco, colour,()eval
2:00 He said calmly the line !!
1:51 As it turns out, war was, in fact, the only way
ردة فعل اني وابوعطوان ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️🫨☠️🫨☠️
Bought gow ps5 edition.. played for a week. Gave to my boy. I dk t even knownif he plays this game. Played it briefly in liked nhl 25 though
Left side calm side
"death can have me when it earn's me" such a epic line
Cant wait to play it
I remember watching this when I was a freshman.. I was so hyped😍😭
we need another GOW game ASAP
хуямба
L3 + R3 is love ❤
2:51
why does the graphics look so much better than in the final game
This is also a ps4 game
Amazing game... 💯🔥
Best game of the 21st century
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: I murdered my own father. You really think you're gonna take me down?
The title is a misnomer
GG
Mimir: “Odin got tricks up his sleeves we haven’t dared to consider”  Kratos: “ You mean Tyr”
Such a waste of potential, obviously 2 games cut up and squished into 1 with characters being insufferable and the open worlds being big spaces of nothing with no interest
PUT THESE FOLISH AMBETIONS TO REST
No one’s talking about how the music matches up with a fight
3 years later and I still get goosebumps watching this
Bro... That nibba in the game...
Amo esse jogo. Épico ❤❤❤
why is this video age restricted?
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
2:50 👀
name of track at 2:12 ? 🙏
«ASHEN GAMES»  Games will soon move to phones on Earth, Paradise, soon the country of Tamri  ستنتقل الألعاب قريباً إلى هواتف الأرض، الجنة، قريباً بلاد التمري Google Play APK
Finally buy it in 2025
Finally finished this game. It was pretty much fun. Took me 47 hours though

أعود كل شتاء ❄️ لكي العبها كأول تجربه ، نعم ياساده إنها افضل لعبة في التاريخ على مر العصور 2024
The fact this lost game of the year is honestly mind blowing to me
This game is about to be fun
I want to play the PS4 version
2:00 The delivery is SO much better than the one in game
On what lies below side quest my blades of chaos won’t reach the rock
Wonder what's next for Santa Monica. This studio is like fine wine
Cant wait for this master piece to finally release
SBI DETECTED 🤮
bruh, youtube doesn't let me whatch the video
The most badass trailer
It is not true
Will replay this on pc with the cj vs big smoke mod 🙏🏻
This game is gonna be goated loki
Soon on PC!
"In moments of crisis, panic was nothing"
It feels like sony this and spider man have been the only exclusive games worth buying a ps5 more. This game was a masterpiece and we need more!
Sur ps4
What’s the song at  2:10 ?
“Are you coming with use”  Answers wid a standing ovation
I love this game so much
we lost the kratos we loved in GOW3 ending.
1:51 *"WAR IS NOT THE ONLY WAY!"* ☝️
Who’s back in 2024
Garbage boring a$$ game, never buy again.. Trash franchise 💩
can't wait for this to release on PC and they mod Angrboda white like it should
I'm honestly going to replay this game. Feel like as if I didn't really use the moveset of all the weapons entirely!🔥🔥
No matter how many times I play the game I will always rewatch this trailer, this is always thrilling no matter how many times I watch it!!
I can vividly remember how hyped I was for this game when they started dropping teaser trailers, and it lived up to every bit of the hype and then some
3:06 : 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
とりあえずドラクエとffとポケモンとキングダムハーツ、モンハンとゼルダ大好きだわw
2:00 *"you seem like a calm and reasonable person! are you a CALM AND REASONABLE person?"*
kratos 🗿
a sweet baby inc game
How time flies
This trailer was so hype on release
Pc when🗿
This game will always be enjoyed millions of times
این بازی بی نظیره
I plantomt the game a year ago 😎
Jogão da poxa
2 years later and I can say that this game is one of the best of the decade
My is there a black person in a game about norse mythology?  Talk about placing yourself in a character.
Visiting this trailer after 2 years, remember the hype back then guys?
> 0:01
2:29 - 2:38 gives me life. The action synced with the hits of the music is TOO perfect.
Real goty 2022.
I couldn’t imagine bonding so much with fictional characters.. but here I am
This game looks just as it does now even though this was made more than a year before it came out!
0:49
yes
I already platinumed the game and yet this still hypes me up.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 🤳🤳🤳😪
does anyone know the name of the 2:13 "in moments of crisis, panic does nothing" track on spotify?
Кратос я не диснею кратос крутой я пройшов кратосу 2 бала и кратосу мультиплеер
It's funny looking back on when this trailer came out, and remembering how everyone was talking about Kratos fighting Tyr like he would be a pushover.
You seem like a calm and reasonable person
Disgusting woke trash!!!! I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. Santa Monica deserves to get the bud light treatment
How did this game lose to elden ring
Kratos was hungry and Atreus brought him food
Still a master piece
2:38 Can you do that move in the game with the blades or is that only for the trailer?
Cant end the day a daily dosage of gow content 🏺
One of the greatest game of all time 🐐
PC Is Waiting To Fulfill The emotion🤩
Esse jogo é uma obra-prima!! Platinei essa maravilha
10/5/2023

Just 100%'d the whole game. What an experience.
Atreus looked so much older in the trailer bra
Hard to believe that it's been 2 years since this dropped.
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years
2:10
Love the loki horns reference
I ❤ krator so much 😘😘😘
The Wolf and the Bear
Two years old and its still awesome
i hope gow will makes into live actions
I can never get around the fact how betrayed I felt when Tyr turned out to be Odin in Disguise. It took me a whole minuite to understand what I just witnessed.
Awesome!
so we saw Odin in this Trailer , we just didn't know that
REDONDO HAS A SON😭 I want him he's the one!
😂
I hate Sony console 😭😭😭😭 because not support in India..no part
I hope kratos return to be more Harsh in Egypt
😂
Dang how did this trailer got in 2021
A masterpiece
This isn't a game its a serie masterpiece
Theme?
1:47 this combat Animation not in the game bro. I need this Animation
I hate this game it is to hard i hate the part we hace to fight thor and dreki they gave us little advantage they should make it more fair next time
who is watching the trailer in again 2023
Atreus all grown up 😭😭
Does anyone know how to do the move on 2:19 ?
He did yoga, thanks Santa monica
we need DLC for that masterpiece
For some reason the aesthetic and sound design of the weapons looks so much nicer here than the final game
2:18
kinda overrated..
🔥🔥gow❤
atreus told every kid in school "my dad can beat up your dad" and he was right
The best game
2:18
Xbox нервно дрожит в сторонке
What’s the music called
Worst part is that "Loki's ironwood" very very boring
Just finished 2018. Downloading this rn
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you."
O gráfico, o trailer, as trilhas sonoras, A HISTÓRIA, tudo nesse jogo é perfeito! ah, não posso deixar de citar a dublagem do jogo para português, ficou sensacional! (a original em inglês também ficou magnífica).
Sony. Do not ruin the only game I’ve ever loved. Do not go Lbgtqjdja… or whatever they are now. Aloy just came out, do not mess this up.
Finally got a PS5 so will be trying this new to me game
Best 👍❤
Why am I excited this game released months ago 🗿
I love Santa Monica ❤❤❤
PC WHEN ? I JUST FINISHED GOW 2018!
cant wait for the next gow after ragnarok ❤😂
R i p multi player games
Atreus: We’re trying to stop Ragnarock. Kratos: No Boy, we’re going to Tahiti!
On gmgow difficulty kratos is absolute dogshi Homie gets one shot by ANYYYTHINNNG
2:11 does anyone know the name of this soundtrack?.
waiting for NG+ 👀
Trash
This is the greatest GOW I’ve ever played  And I’ve got 100% trophy completion… I never got tired of it
A masterpiece
2:24
It's awesome as particular as seems like an by completing this action  are creationg by Santa Monica and the cold war
Watching this after I beat the game and I still get chills watching this somehow lol 😮‍💨
2:39 2:38 2:37
3:06 ah… there it is. Knew it had to of been coming
I am offended.
ah i miss the hype for this game 😢❤
огонь теперь не во 👎
It's Time Kratos Pulls Out The 'Belt Of Chaos'
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person.
Can you put Hindu Chinese Egyptian and Samoan gods please
In moments of crisis panic does nothing. Harness it Let it serve you. 2:21
Best PS5 game ever
Imagine this was a film
Kratos before was angry and cap person now he's pretty calm and reasonable person.
“…start thinking like general”  Ares joined the conversation.
2:18¿ anyone saw that Execution in the game? I just get to do it with The Raiders from midgar,But Without the ice sparks effect. Such a shame,  It looks really Dope for an Hold R2 Attack.
It’s here
50% Complete 😎  Upload 1 video Guys Plz check it out 😊
This game  cool
2:24
does any one knows from which track of the soundtrack the music in 2:15 is from
Who else finished the game but still watches this and gets hyped? I can’t wait for New Game +! ❤
Dear Santa Monica Studios please give back Kratos cloak for the next update. I kindly appreciate it!
Why there is this one and the Nov. 9 version is there any differences?
Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general !   Best phrase of the whole video !
With the way GOW: Ragnarök ended, I'm wondering if we might get a spinoff game where we play as Atreus searching for the rest of the Giants
Me when I saw new Atreus: “Holy puberty
Just finished the game.. Was it worth the hype?? ABSOLUTELY!!!!!
AWESOME GAME!!!
What is the name of the music in 2:13
Cant wait for its PC release in 2026! :D
I love this game sm❤
What black girl do in ragnarök myths?😂
Remember when people were mad because they revealed "Tyr" in the trailer? That was fun
Aight now just release on pc
this game has a soul
Don't buy it on the ps4 beacuse you can't pass the game
I just noticed the colon is missing from the subtitle on the P.S store and in the video title. Is this correct? (grammar-wise)
This game was the second biggest disappointment I’ve ever played.
Wonder if they would ever be smart enough to make Loki the big bad guy in the next one. Kratos has got to Atreus to save him and Freya's new family.
The violin st near the end of the vid can someone give me it’s name* plz
This game was a masterpiece ❤
2:19 what move is that in the game please if anyone knows lmk 🙏
يلعن ام ام العظمة
Crazy how the dwarf on the bridge at 1:28 is Odin in disguise (confirmed by Eric Williams)
anyone know if this will ever come out on PC?
where tf is fenrir im gonna cry
The time draws near u must prepare yourself, it's the time to kill off kratos 😍😍 Ragnarok is coming soon
Does anyone know how to get the scene where he’s overlooking the land?
Woah I just noticed that the deer horns on his head are a foreshadowing of him having horns in future.
Awesome trailer!
In moments of crisis panic does nothing ❤
Bend over by Elden Ring in 2022, despite being a decent game. \[👽]/
The game is great but the voice and action Odin cast is horrible. Richard Schiff is a great actor but he is no Odin. They should have had Ian McShane return to the role he made great in American gods.
Does anyone know what music this is on the original soundtrack? 2:14
Does anyone know if the attack with the blades of chaos at 3:38 is still in the game and if so how it can be triggered? I find it really cool but have not yet come across it
what is dat armor called
Really? This is what the parts deemed appealing enough to make it into the trailer look like? Ahr, er. As we say in stralya... Yeah, nah.  To add insult to injury, it's an $89 game. You can get the disc-edition of the 'station for $799, yet all the bundles are $904. Last time I checked, bundles cost less than the sum of the individual items inside them. Oh.... and it's a digital download, so it costs more when you factor-in the intertubes cost and the consumed SSD space.  What kind of a genius came up with such an idea? An accountant? Nnnnnnnext!
Games was disappointing. Didn’t have the magic that gow 2018 had. Gow 2018 still better
The only reason I bought a Ps3 was so I could play GoW 3. The only reason I bought a Ps4 pro was so I can play GoW and only reason I got a Ps5 was for Ragnarok. All 3 games are the only ones I played from start to finish.
1:28 as Mimir says Odin, look who's standing on top of the bridge. SMS have been toying with us for over a year 🤣
YOOOO ITS ODIN 1:27
Idc this game didn't won goty cuz its my goty
How did this Game not win? It won most of the Awards and still lost GOTY. That being said Elden Ring still is a great game.
GAME OF THE YEAR.. I REALLY HOPE IT WINS
haaaaaaaaaaa GAME OF THE YEAR
Playing this game right now. What a masterpiece!
Anybody else coming back to this after completing the game?
Now that the game is already here, how do I do this combo: 1:47?
Beautiful game. Making the holiday szn hit diff 😮‍💨
2:12 müzik nerde buluruz ya?
Is anyone able to do the move @2:18?
lets wait 4 years for pc release lets goooooooooooooo
Why does nobody talk about how they gave Atreus the horns of Loki in the trailer on purpose
It ez
The Antlers of the Deer is Loki's horns
What’s up with the patchwork clothing on all the characters? There’s a reason why this scrappy look is only found in modern fantasy. I wish they would’ve taken at least a little inspiration from history instead of the modern look. And ragnarøk is spelled wrong, if they can’t even get that right I don’t know what to think
Hits different after playing the game
BOYY is time for ragnarok
1:27 clever. Now that the director revealed that dwarf spitting on the water to be Odin, the trailer shows the scene as soon as Mimir mentions Odin lol
3:08 Wow, it happens! Again.
Who is watching thid trailer even after ending the game? Cant stop myself
Beautiful game 👌
I have finished the game but still play this trailer 😂😂😂
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you." Such a cool and wise line.
Best Game Of All Time, GGS
I Need Dj fighter New game  Need for speed2👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
0:57 kratos's deep voice 🥵🔥
2:14 where can I find this OST guys please do let me know?
"Odin has tricks up his sleeve we haven't dated to consider" 💀
We will all ways remember this trailer made us so hype
Who's here after they Platinum'd the game?
Time : ✈️
2:19 dont even thinks in the game :'(
Best game of my life
Thank you for masterpiece its an amazing experience alot of learning  Of life from Kratos  From my childhood to being young
2:13 Does anyone know what this song is?
i hope kratos fight in mitology Indonesia , vs Antasena
Can anyone tell me what song from the OST the music at 2:15 is from? I can't find it but I really like it.
Coming back to this now and ngl, I really thought Tyr would be epic  But overall, really loved the game!
2:13 Does anyone know which soundtrack is?
Worst ending to yalls game goku negs Kratos goofy child and a weird father xbox better
Anyone else notice in 1:35 they changed the background of sindri’s home to be in presumably svartalfheim when it’s in the realms between realms
Chorus is an 11 dollar game that is FREE with premium. Has a pS4 and PS5 version but has IMPECCABLE adaptive triggering in the sandbox combat. There is ZERO excuse for GOWR to not have them!!
I’m definitely going to Platinum this Masterpiece! Game was well worth the Hype 💯👏
3 years plaaying still cant beatvalkyrie queen, maybe i need help
Who’s here after beating the game
You're the best! Keep it up.
How y'all gonna put tension in my triggers when I skip a rock but not when I throw an axe? I'm just saying, as a Sony title, your adaptive triggers should have been on par with Astros Room but y'all just said forget it I guess. I don't understand.
That free game Chorus smoked y'all in the adaptive triggers department.
Tyr is basically GOW's version of "The Cake is a Lie"
0:22 has anyone notice? Atreus silhoutte has horn just like how Loki looks?
What part of the soundtrack is playing here?
2:11 who made this music ? I couldn't find it in the OST of the game.
Whats the theme when tyr stands up?
Who’s here after finishing the game? 😢
Where is BeowulF?
Can't we go back in time ??? Like How young kratos still human  became an excellent warrior fighting for ares ??? We didn't see Olympus on ps4 ps5 we didn't see athens on ps4 ps5 .
What’s the music @2:12 ?
2:12 anyone know what track in the OST is? i can't find it .-.
in gow 4 and gow ragnarok kratos uses 30-40% of his real power kratos real power is much more he still had olympus blade and many weapons he got from olympian gods he had hermes speed hercules fists flying wings and many, many others
Great game
Where is the song at 2:14 plzzzz … Not in the album 😭😭😭
So...... there's 2 moves that are not currently in the game.....
Remember: In GOW2 Kratos has the power to control the time, And with this power we can see another game with the gods of olympus in the future maybe one game with new kratos and the old one
Does anyone know the title of the ost starting from 2:11 ? It doesn’t seem to be included in the original soundtrack…
This game is fire
Those tyr he….
This game was truly a 10/10 made me tear up and everything. Absolutely loved this game with all my heart
Anyone back here because they just finished this masterpiece?
Kratos: *Interacts with woman* Playerbase: Yooo it's time for snu snu!!
The song once Thor shows up with the hammer. What’s the name of it on the soundtrack? Anyone know ?
Does anyone know how to do that move at 2:18
2:18 can you do that move in the game I don’t see it anywhere else
love to see those 30 fps trailers
I’m gonna be in Tyr’s after I finish this game
when you own the game but real life gets in the way of you playing so you watch the trailer to keep that feeling going..
2:24 this line comes up in a generally unremarkable conversation in the game, but its so sick in this trailer
Please, does any one know the name of the song that plays at 2:14 in the game ost?! I can not find it anywhere
This broke my monkey brain, it's so amazing
It's rare for an entire game to be this badass from beginning to end.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack near the end of the trailer? I’ve been looking everywhere for it.
Sabia que karchez era un grande
What's the name of soundtrack at 2:12?
Tyr is the best bait in the trailer
ANY TAMIL GAMING COMMUNITY
I have yet to find the song from 2:12 onward despite hearing it IN game, if any of y’all know the name let me know
This game is fun but it has the same problem I had with kena. I can only play for about 1 to 1.5 hours before it crashes my ps5. Then I have to unplug the console before it will turn back on. Some might think it's a heat issue but I can play every other game for 5+ hours at a time sometimes. Ratchet and Clank, demons souls, horizon forbidden west and a dozen more AAA ps5 titles. It's just kena and GOW Ragnarok that cause my ps5 to crash.
Kratos faces his thoughts challenges raishin a teenage  boy.
When in the steam???????(((
Does anyone know if you can do this in the game? 2:19
am i the only one that likes rewatching trailers after beating the game😅
Who’s here after finishing the game?
Can't wait to make a new trilogy with Egyptian gods with the old swords 😛
Anyone know the name of the track that starts playing at 2:13?
2:13 whats the song? Is it in the official ost?
This game was truly a 10/10 made me tear up and everything. Absolutely loved this game with all my heart
Perfect end to the trailer. This is a great game
Just finished it... 8000/10
This game is Rated M for Masterpiece.
"In moments of crisis... panic knows nothing.. harness it.... let it serve you."
The character development, Kratos is PEAK FICTION
Lol
what is the name of the ost when he fights? it plays also during the fiske fight but i cant find it :/
Tyr fella looks cool
"The cycle doesn't ends here"
Woooiio el doblaje español latino, inglés, Japonés los mejores amo.este videojuego es Excelente.
2:13 song? Spotify?
This game has so many moments that made me go 😱😳🤯
2:48 (Adventure Time) BIIIILLLYYYY!!!!!!!! "NOTHUNG!!!"  o()xxx[{::::::::::>
2:30  Click this a bunch of times in a row.
This is basically assassin's creed valhalla's DLC not worth the money. Do not recommend.
I can’t decide if it is character developement or it is a sales policy.
I'm 8 hours into this game and I've barely scratched the surface.. there's so much to do
how many new tattoos will this part bring :)
Where’s fat thor?
Now that the game's released, does anyone know the names of the soundtracks used in this trailer? They're so epic but I can't find them!
is it available on PS4???
beautiful game.
Im buying this today im hyped!
wow - terrible accents
1:55 Hits harder knowing what happened in the previous games. Character development at its finest.
I hope he wins in the end
Boi hit puberty
If Ragnarök and Elden Ring proved just one thing, it is that some games still live up to their hype.
Dajcie mi wreszcie pelna polska wersję oszuści. Co to jest dorzucić darmowe dlc za 0 zł w ps store które będzie  opisane jako paczka języka do pobrania ............ nie pracują nad tym szybko...  jak ja w 5min wymyśliłem proste rozwiązanie a wy co ? Albo pozwulcie posiadacza płyt ściągnąć wersję cyfrowa która działa tak jak ma. Macie 2 wyjścia na szybko choćby tym czasowo że te wersję cyfrowe działają tyko do czasu naprawienie tego patchem.  Łatwe proste a potem możecie doktoryzować sobie jak to naprawić:) jest długi weekend ludzie chce grać tak jak za to zapłacili !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you idiots! guys! look what they have done! made kratos soft!
I’m playing this masterpiece right now and Boy it’s Awesome.
Who thinks this is gonna be The game of the year
Whos watching while having a copy of the game
The fighting is very difficult to remember all 900 moves
Fun fact: The guy who plays Thor also played Beta one the Whisperers.
OST released but it's missing the part from 2:11 an on :((
I love that the reveal only shows stuff that happens at the beginning of the game
Somehow Norse and Greek mythology is now crossing with African mythology 😮 I wonder if it’s African folklore mythology or Woke virtue signaling🤔
Ahh back here on release day for the “moments of crisis line” enjoy everyone!
Does anyone know the name of the track that plays at 2:12?
And if those answers lead to war with Asgard.
ITS HERE! Bout to play it!
Let’s go it’s finally out
And then the end credit scene is kratos falling into a portal and into the mcu
My mum pre ordered this for me she's gonna get the best mothers day present
6 more hours boys. Who’s watching this one more time?
Today ❤
Greek kratos is better but English boy is better than the Greek one
Thor: ,, are you a calm and reasonable person? ,, Kratos: L3+R3
3 hours until its unlocks for play...I cant contain my excitement
Why did I think this was coming out in 2023?
Gives me major Avatar vibes…
2:12 Best part of the trailer right here
kratos doesn't' have the same buttery smooth voice as he had in gow 2018 but i might be wrong
from 2:12 onward, the music is so epic!
tomorrow the day
So hyped for tomorrow when the game launches, Im gonna take 2 days off
We only got 1 more day boys 🎉
Ragnarok draws near in just over 24 Hours. Prepare yourselves brethren.
Can not believe I get to play this at 11:00 pm tmrw, time really does fly before our eyes, gotta enjoy every second of this amazing game before it’s just another memory 😔
Only a few more hours now. I literally can’t wait
YALL IM GETTING IT ON SATURDAY YAUYAUAYAAYYA
After this Norse setting we can say that Kratos really became a calm and reasonable person
Almost time my brothers and sisters.
After a year of patience, it’s almost here, my friends.
Atreus Kinda….
2:05 did kratos just do a Scorpion brutality??
almost time baby!!!!!
game of the year for sureeeeee
So close to the actual release date…..
3 MORE DAYS BOYS!!!!!!!!!
Imagine if game starts right from moment when Thor came to Kratos home
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing"
At the end of GOW Ragnarok: Souls would be lost, fights that may change the course of the fates. But at the end , Kratos accepts that Atreus must fulfill his role as Loki. Atreus/Loki: “Remember our promise”. Kratos:”Loki will go. Atreus…… Atreus remains.” One of the 😢 ending that will definitely make you cry. But be glad , cause they’ll return in the future as long time remains to thrive on.
This game can be summed up as  "Your lucky Kratos isn't here"
Elden Ring is better
it looks pretty much like a carbon copy of the previous one, but as long as it actually has different kinds of bosses instead of that same guy with the frigging battering ram in different skins, then im for it.
2:18
We are so close
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person، are calm and reasonble person"🌹💯
Boi is bucked up with being able to life that buck
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  ... Here lies Thor, may he rest in peace
Amount of cringe commentary here is big.
Here before this becomes game of the year
It would come out when I just sold my PS4 pro I had no clue there was another one coming out
will i will be damed
Oh man TYER!!! AND KRATOS UNDERSTANDING THE TOLL OF WAR!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyr is Odin!
5 days to go let’s go
"Trailer" in 2021 means gameplay. 0 effort put into this
6 days my friendssssssss!, 5 dayssss my friendssssssssssssssssss!
How a year has passed and now we’re only  days away from this masterpiece
17M
🔥
Musieli czarnego na koniec władować
GOTY
why i feel like kratos journey will be over in this game
8 more days
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person?" made me cry
2:00 Is it just me or does Thor sound like Josh Brolin?
"you seem like a calm and reasonable person...."    Kratos: AAARRRGHHHH
Will there be one hit kill villains. If so then I'm skipping it
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: L3 + R3
...
Thor - "You seem like a calm and reasonable person" Kratos - "Wouldn't you like to know, weather boy"
I need it!
Man I really hope we can to actually play n wear that outfit wit the cape he rocks in the beginning
The graphics and textures are really looking sharp and nice.
The best new thing in this game  : Mimir reading a book with a spoon BOOM MIND BLOWING
Whose the girl?
Anyone notice the silhouette of the deer antlers going into the cave looks like Loki’s helmet?
The norse mythology is definitely Kratos’s redemption arc
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gonna love!This Game!..Iam after the last two Valkyries now, Prior to this sequel.👏👏👌💯.
Just realised that at 2:13 the music is briefly synced with the combat
THERE IS A TIME FOR PEACE  AND A TIME FOR WAR IM SUP SUPER ER IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
1:55 probably this scene is after Thor beats our boy. He needs to get back in his track asap.
It’s crazy how last game, Atreus wanted Kratos to be a father. Now he wants him to be a general.
1:11
I really do love that the game is being released in winter. To set the mood for Ragnarok
Music?
That last soundtrack when kratos meets tyr hits different..
I thought Freya's curse stopped her from harming any living thing, so how is she attacking Kratos?
Kratos doesn't know what he's messing with ⚡️😡⚡️
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Ask Poseidon and Zeus and Hercules.
Kimm Looks great. My unborn son can fianlly enjoy this on a PS5 when they become available at his 21st....
The fcking goosebumps
*Tyr stands up*  Kratos: "I thought you'd be bigger"
I'm wondering how Freya broke the curse where she can't attack/draw blood
Can we please keep all the things I worked so hard for in 2018
Atreus starting ragnarok is crazy
Father what is this sensation that i feel happening in my body whenever i see Angrboda ..... Something odd happens like i want to do something to her...   KRATOS: BOY ... you must now know something very important....
Kratos then to Zeus : FATHER YOUR SON HAS RETURNED I BRING THE DESTRUCTION OF OLYMPUS   Kratos Now: War is Not The Only Way  Me: Seems like a Calm and Reasonable Person to me giggity 👍🏽
The difference between Sony and Xbox Exclusives is that Sony studios put soooo much MORE love and care and detail and depth into their exclusives than any other.  Try and compare GodOfWar Ragnarok to ANYTHING released by Xbox with the same love and detail, and it is IMPOSSIBLE. There is just NOTHING that compares to Sony Exclusives
I think that beginning scene in the cave might be the menu
The soundtrack for this game is going to be phenomenal!!
😎
0:28 BOY
One word.Orgasmic
IM SO EXCITED ABOUT JACKSEPTICEYE PLAYING THIS GAME ONLY ME?
Sorry Nerdbox NONE FOR YOU
whats that black girl doing in norse mythology?
boys, the countdown. It's nearly here.
Bro.. broooo i still get chills a year later.
Sorry elden ring your dad is here for gotr😂
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”                                      Kratos      *Let the rage of the gods drive your blades*       *Let the rage of the titans fuel your blades*          *Let the rage of Sparta fuel your blade*                    **Spartan Rage Available**
1:39, baby world serpent?
A black girl in Scandinavia is like a white guy in Nigeria
How 1 year bel
Mixigaming đã xem
That no was the deepest most powerful no I’ve ever heard
23 days until Ragnarökkkkkk
Boi
This is going to be amazing!
Finally a game worth getting a PS5 for, now just to find one for MSRP..
Came here 3 weeks before launch to read all the comments from Xbox babies with tears to fill my cup. 🤣
EVERYONE READY THOSE WALLETS RAGNAROK IS COMING AND ITS GONNA BE LIT
Even in GOW the diversity is shining bright lol
Who is stronger Greek gods or Norse gods?
Kratos vs thor. Amazing battle. Cant wait to go live with it. Pre ordered and everything else done.
I won't be a calm and reasonable person until the game comes out.
The silhouette at the beginning of Atreus wearing antlers...
IT'S amazing
Angrboda is not black
" Death can have me, when it earns me" . Gave me the chills. What an epic line.
Winter is coming
0:22 Loki is coming baby!!
Did I see centaur in norse realms? hmm cool !
Yes, Tyr is half Jotunn (giant)
That was sensationally breathtaking the  background and the entire quality is totally superb and cozy
*sup, future kelan* 😎
I can wait until I want to drop kick Atreus even more now that he’s a literal teenager
2:14 that has to be heimdall cuz he came out frm the bifrost
I really hope kratos cuts Thor's belly open or something even more ruthless  Need that gow3 type aggression back
This game has evolved!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Just like the 2018 game, a silhouette appears in the snow, instead, this time it's Atreus, not Kratos, showing that he's grown.
kratos akan mati pada game ragnarok ini,dan anaknya kratos akan menikah dengan ibunya baldur
The visual of Atraeus/Loki walking in with the horns… wow
glad they are keeping mimmir
The countdown officially  starts today let's go not long now
Game of the year
Dopeeee
I hope there is a scene where kratos and Thor summon each other's weapons and kratos wields mjilnoir
I hope your ready to sink mad hours into this game boy!🤣
Can't wait for the final installment "war of gods"
Tyr is freaking huge
Mayday finisher fr
"war is not the only way" . The whole Olympus gods who sees from the heaven : Um👍🙂
It’s a bit funny that kratos and BOY are still talking about BOYS mother and having disagreements
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!"   Kratos being a Spartan General on Sparta: BOI
Wonder what the explanation is going to be to why our Leviathan Axe and Chaos Blades are back to its weakest states rather then the max upgraded versions. Why all our armor is gone and how its possible that Kratos and Atreus forgot all their skills and power over just the span of a few years (that were apparently still violent and full of training considering the coming of Ragnarok)  Honestly I would just want all that to port over and deal with it as if its a NG+
Put it on Xbox you dirty horse
Probably gonna win another game of the year
WE'RE GOLD!!!!!! 🥇🥇🥇🥇
I wonder if there is a reflection of Cory Barlog or any of the main writers with Kratos
Looks more like a dlc than another game.
2:21
lets goooooooooooo
Yo,tyr got his hands intact?
2:50 yall already know Kratos can easily clap Tyr with that stare down.
This has to be the last Cross gen game! I will not buy any PS5 exclusive that will be on PS4 as well!
And this all started because Baldur mistook Kratos for his wife.
Yes, it's much easier to kill a whole pantheon of gods than raising a rebelling kid.
What is the date
PC😔😔😔😔
Thor: "you seem like a calm and reasonable person."  Kratos: L3 + R3
this game will explode our minds
The music when Atreus is walking with the deer is 🔥 gets you ready for Ragnarok
"I need the answers now....girl"😅
I genuinely cannot wait for this, it's going to be incredible! 🔥🔥🔥
I hope we get to see more with Zeus and Kratos in GOW RAGNAROK
So Tyr will be the final boss right?
I hope more of Kratos's past is reavealed to everyone
Uhm didn’t try lose his hand to fenris I mean he had to have been born and locked up the world serpents alive
“Last time I thought like a general boy, I gave my soul to ares”
Kratos will face destruction caused by the prophecy of Ragnarok in norse mythology, will Kratos survive Ragnarok?
"In moments of crisis" "Panic does nothing" "Harness it" "Let it serve you"
I can’t wait to abuse enemies with the Blades of Chaos and listen to Kratos yell “BOI” for however many hours this games run time is. I’m so excited
Wow is so nice the game
3:08  Kratos: Boy you better use protection. A wolf, a snake, and a queen of Hel are born Kratos: Bo-y!
what if? Kratos against all the odds defeats all the Gods and Monsters across the different Realms and finds the way to the Realm of Heaven where Michael will be waiting for him🥶
atreus voice actor changed?
Best game ever cant beleve its soon cooming!
The best game in the world
That silhouette of Atreus carrying the deer looks like a foreshadow of Loki
Anyone knows if you buy the ps4 version is a free upgrade to ps5 or do you have to pay extra?
I love Kratos's angry 'NO' after atreus/loki tells him to start thinking like a general. Just tells you how the horror of being a general again haunts Kratos to this day
It’s amazing how much they improved it from this trailer. Even here it was already looking great!
Trailer hits different wen u own a ps5
Well freya duel looks cool
He won't be BOI anymore, he is now GUY.
Yoo how is this already one year ago
Well another game of the year for gow
Are you a calm and reasonable person.   Kratos......
The ESG-score-gender-and-race-representation-character included at the end of the trailer was a nice touch
Freya is Indica Flower. Change my mind
He is definitely a experienced fighter
Not sure if this was mentioned, probably so, but I just realized the statue in this trailer is the shadowy figure at the door presumably Odin in the newer trailer.
Friend - How did you pass your exams ?   Me - In moments of crisis panic does nothing . Harness it . Let it serve you.
Atreus' voice is going to be insufferable
so this what the hype about? man get out my face lol all this hype i thought he was back on demon time but i was mistaken
How did boy grow we was not big when he met thor. Was he standing there for so long?
DID HE SAY TYR????
When Tyr stood up, Baldur "You're definitely bigger."
Just finished the last game for the 2nd time. Less than two months left for Ragnarok, the hype is REAL. I already know this will be a masterpiece.
Honestly I think it would of made the game 10x better if they didn't show us Tyr was alive in the trailers
Is this real?
After the dwarves had taken all their measurement, I'd expect the head to  be given a new body.
Hes about to unlock the most powerfull weapon the belt!!!
Would love a line when Thor enters :  GIVE ME KRATOSSS
Tyr hasn't lost his hand yet
I can not wait until the release date! I am so excited
Oh no it was 1 year ago holyyyyyyy
Cant wait to see him get in hes prime personality again
Blackwashing I saw blackwashing
Imagine if the Thor love and thunder have Kratos it would be the best movie of all the item
sony pinaccle of gaming
Had anyone noticed how at the beginning when Artreus enters with the deer  that the silhouette kinda looks like the traditional Loki with his helmet?
I think we’re ignoring the fact at 2:25 Kratos is fighting a Centaur. That’a a Greek, not Norse thing
Let’s go! 48 days left!!!!
I love that Kratos is the one to say, War is not the answer, it shows how much he's grown since his days of reckless fighting
Santa Monica, please don't do what CDPR did. Take your time and release a finished product you can be proud of.
I love how there seems to be a lot more enemy variety in this game than in the previous. Previous game was more or less different versions-or elemental variants- of Draug and Helwalkers, with some Trolls, Ogres and a few more oddities thrown into the mix.
2 months left
ITS ALREADY BEEN A YEAR
Kratos gives me the same vibes as Thors the Troll from Vinland saga. He understands the consequences of war
His hatred of gods never ceases to amaze me. And jfc it’s justified.
*Cries in xbox*
wow!
Thor: You seem like a Calm and reasonable person
Oh this boy is sooo anoying
Allways been a Xbox owner but just because of this I’ll get a ps
I will LIVE STREAM my game play on my YouTube channel when it comes out. Subscribe to Watch!
Will this be available for ps4?
Anyone else here after the September 2022 trailer
Kratos. A non human factual speaker about life's deepest truths😩
Just wow😊😊
Well I now have a reason to boot up my ps5 that’s been collecting dust
🤦‍♂️🥴👎🤭😢🥴👎🤬🤦‍♂️
So the game will run at 30 fps?
only thing they should fix is angrboda race ..everyone know that character is white....cory wants accurate lore representation .so they made FAT thor just like the lore..so why not fix her as well !! ???
Here after the new trailer
they dumbed down this game so much it used to be badass. now its meh
I can see goty 2022
Boy the music is fire especially the end right before Angrobooa hits you right in the feels AY WHOs CUTTING ONIONS
Death Can Have Me , When It Earns Me
GOTY 2022
Imagine if the "world elites" expresses these gods, through videogames?🤯 Like they're real gods, but being spoken through video games
Thor: Are you a calm and a reasonable person? Krastos: Check out the second trailer
Most mysterious shady cliffhangery trailer ending in history
Krastos seams weak
take my money
War is not the only way, but it is the most fun!
Who came back from seeing the new trailer?
I'm so stoked for this game, thank you Santa Monica Studios for bringing this out on PS4, eternal gratitude!!!
No way it's been a year since this. I remember this dropping as if it was just a few months ago
Yes, Im crying, so?
this and new trailler😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
this norse mythology is nothing to what kratos experience in the olympus lol
I don't know who some of these enemies are but I do know they're about to get busted.
I cant wait!! 😕
3:01 I guess she's gonna be arteus mate
BOY!
Who’s here after that fire state of play trailer?
Can’t wait to play this game!!!
Back here after the latest trailer just dropped. So much has improved since last year and I absolutely can’t wait for this game…
❤
This game is the best by far, the whole GOW franchise is just amazing. Once Tyr stood up it really hit me, I felt so hyped. In my eyes, GOW is the best game franchise overall.
I wonder who's gonna chop off Tyr's hand
I hope Kratos makes it out of this one lol
17 million's is coming
2:29 Why is there a centaur?
Did I just hear Kratos saying "War is not the only way"?!
WE want it in PC 👍👍👍🔥
i feel like this game is setting us up for a war wth olympus i can see it
So, Kratos and Loki are going to Africa
still can't believe people say this looks like a dlc
2:29 Artemis?
love this W
MAN ITS TIME I CAN SEE IT(LIKE STAR WARS YOU KNOW)PLS SOMEBODY. ITS TIME TO BRING KRATOS TO THE BIG SCREEN(CAN I PLAY A PART?!...LOL
Kratos should probably kill odin and Thor but him and atreus should save a pantheon instead of destroying it. So excited!
Take ma monez
The hype feels insane
02:40 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really want to wear the cloak
It's been a year daddy
Tyr was almost the Size of Hercules!
im most excited about the return of brok and sindri
59 Day's!!!!
Ragnarok is coming
I really hope that Tyr recognizes Kratos the moment he sees him and says "Ghost of Sparta?" in total confusion. I'd love for that to be the starting point of Atreus learning about Kratos's past. It would make sense seeing as Tyr is fully aware of who he is, evident by the treasures of him in the temple.
Is that the girl from the polar express
"In collaboration with Marvel Studios™"
Atreus does not look old enough to have that voice
Always been a masterpiece franchise, can't wait to explore other realms ❤👌
Ah, the Ghost of Sparta returns.
The cold wind rise as Ragnarok draws closer
they should just make a series out of this already, maybe an anime
His shield broke when she attacked thats how we got new ones - the more ya know
It's been a year, who can believe it?
hearing kratos said lad was amazing tho hehe
its a universe
i tell you men, google play has some killer games, there is some like galaga, planes games are incredible
After everything Kratos had to go through in Olympus, and now Atreus asking him to "think like a general"... Ouch. That hits real deep. I wonder if or when Atreus is ever going to find out
Less than 60 days til release!
Stop Ragnarok 🥲
GOW: RAGNAROK😍
I hope there's a part in the game where someone exposes kratos's past and Atreus will finally understand who the he's rolling with and why he's always holding back.
Why black woman is in this game ?
Can’t believe it’s been a year since then
1 year ago. Time flies
A year ago, this masterpiece came to us ❤️
I think tyr saying to Kratos are you calm and reasonable because he knows who Kratos really is?
I'm betting they are gonna kill off tyr
All I want from this game is for the BOI to become a MAN (And become playable.)
The best video game
Why is there ni.gga?
Come on Sony, it's September. Show us somethjng. Just a gameplay would suffice. Please 🙏
The boy : Stop Thinking like a father for moment, start thinking like a general! Kratos : No!! Me : oh boy, you have no idea what happen when kratos thinking like a general
Cant wait to see Kratos fight Freya in bed 🗿
You can tell that Odin and Freya made a deal
Kratos: When this is over, that hammer is going in someone’s @$$!
I just wanted to watch the trailer again, got notification it was being released and did i want to pre order, i wonder will they release a new trailer soon, cant wait for this game. Im not a big gamer but i loved this game, its cool its also being released on PS4 too....Most hyped for this game more then any..
amazing ragnarok 😊😊
Atraus voice is changed
I want them to interact with normal people. Maybe save a village and get worshiped.
Does he have a car in this game?
2:52
I have no patience
2:12 was that warrior from that beam of light an Aesir?
This Is 100% Going To Be GOTY
Umm.... who is that at 2:06 getting speared by Kratos? Kinda looked like Tyr a bit, but Tyr's hairstyle was different
This game is gonna be so hype
Oh yeah… gimme that PC release 🤤
Tyr looks like ube from viking series
How about this: we kill odin, which lifts all his magic, giving freya her fighting spirit and wings, and then we fight her as the final boss (the real valkyrie queen freya).
W game know it already
This seems like a calm and reasonable game
The world serpent is still here
Kratos : but i am your monster no longer
i should play this game again before Ragnarok
Look at my man Kratos all grown up and now has a son. I'm proud of ma man, let's go Kratos we finishing another game together!!!!
Saw the ad?
If Atreus doesn't know what Mother want, neither does Kratos
Thor       :  You seems like a calm a reasonable person Kratos    :  See above your head Thor       :   Why is a circle flying over my head Kratos   : You asked me if i'm a calm and reasonable person. Allow me to demonstrate
Why is mimir reading a book, he probably already knows all of the text in it
Ryan Hurst as Thor is definitely going to be one of the highlights of this game.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person ? Kratos: L3+R3
I love the relationship Mimir and them formed
bro kratos dont  wanna be that dog he used to be
😱😱😱
they need to put the original 5 on ps5 its so unfair why not just rerelease them for newer fans
Will this be on ps4
I love how they changed the “logo” from red to blue, I don’t know if it’s an intentional reference to how Kratos tattoos were originally supposed to be blue but it’s hella cool.
Goty 2022 hands down
*Desperately hoping Freya comes around*
All i can say is this game is my favourite it took me out of a very depressing time of my life and brought so much joy playing every second thank you so much santa monica for making such a amazing game
ایشالله بعد کنکورم بازیش میکنم و عشق میکنم باش
Ga kuat bro duitnya pengen beli ps5 sma tvnya give dong yang banyak duit nich
I am not ready for that 😭😭😭 I don’t know why but I have the strong feeling that it’s the last opus with Kratos 😭😭
atraceus is still annoying asf
War is not the only way... This just out from kratos....!!!
رائعة جدا 😍🙏
THIS WAS RELEASED A YEAR AGO???? IM FANBOYING OVER THIS GAME NOW THINKING THIS WAS RECENF
I love it 🥰
Lol i see my boy atreus has got a gf 2😏
I hope after destroying norse mythology kratos goes to Egyptian mythology to kill more gods and after that japanese or chinese or mayan and aztec
Its the beard
To rockstar I'm coming baby 😈
Why do i feel that after ragnarok, kratos and boi gonna end up at japan because of ghost of tsushima ester egg
Ah can't wait to finish this game, I mean finish watching this game on youtube
BIG BOI
WAR IS COMING
Who do you guys think will be the final boss? I narrowed it down to Thor,Freya,or Tyr Honestly I want IT ALLLL!!! Preferably Thor or Freya
O jogo do ano! 😍
WHEN FOR PC???
Playing and savoring new game + in preparation for Ragnarok! 🤘
Anyone ask me I think last seen under zeus
Bro ngl kratos looked downright scared at the new version of theyre encounter at the house. Like compared to the end in gow 4 where he was more angry I guess, He looked more scared like way more scared
I really hope we get to see some moment in the game where Kratos says "alright, that's it" and takes down ANOTHER pantheon.
I am sure Thor will kill Odin
please give Indonesian voice actors for the GOW raknarok game, many Indonesian people want to be given Indonesian voice actors 🙏🏻🙏🏻
GOTY2022
still praying for this to come to PC as soon as possible 🙏
Were less than a month out for this and this is still the only trailer wtfs going on?
"Are you a calm, and reasonable person" Kratos: Yes....No
Hopefully he doesn’t kill freya this game
And thats what were gonna see in ragnarok
Do you know in gdw 4 you can see a kratos vs thor secret ending
Atreus is big
Thor- you look like a calm and reasonable person   Kratos - Then thor is a fool….
We need another trailer with some gameplay in it.
What happened to all the upgrades on the Faye's axe and the Blades of Chaos?
Those 2 wolves carrying the carriage might be Skoll and Hati
BOY! NISTA PISTA! These dialogues never get old
This might finally and i mean finnaaaaly replace witcher 3 as the greatest game of all time
MAN MAKE THIS KID MATURE... I DONT WANT TO HEAR HIS CHILDISH VOICE :D
I’ll just go in to cryogenic sleep until November
Fun fact, I believe Mimir is Odin himself.
Harus sihh ini di mainin kak reggie
Young brother: “Hey isn’t that guy from Forti-“ Me: 1:57
his rage bar still not full
B O Y
🙏📖aprendiendo desde el Inframundo🙏📖AGE OF Mythology
not gonna lie i miss the old voice actor a lil
1. Going by how the trailers of gow 2018 look compared to the final game, Ragnarok will look even better on release.  2. This game will look beautiful on an OLED TV at 120hz. Especially the bifrost. 3. Mimir is probably the only friend Kratos has. He can even recognize his moods from his angry face 😅
Where the duck did kratos put his Zeus armor and my weapon upgrades
0:49 wait Freya can attack now?
I have a dream big dream ... In the middle of the game kratos goes beside the river and shave those beards and again he becomes GHOST OF SPARTA!!! all father odin , noble thor , surtur just run while you can!
I see the old man and young boy are still bickering lol
Me gustaría soltar kratos para acabar con los ejércitos del mundo
I think kratos is forming an army, coz why else Loki would say the word "general* if it's only two of them.
Just finished my 2nd play through can’t wait already pre ordered
Two things we can use boy to shoot whit bow and boy can use rage în this game
Xbox
Excited to be a calm and reasonable person
Times I watched this : 334
Kratos to zues : I AM HERE TO BRING THE DESTRUCTION OF OLYPUS Kratos to Thor : war is not the only way
Thor:"You seem like a calm and reasonable man" Olympus:" But he ain't one"
I think Atreus is not Kratos son. According to the mythology Loki is Thors Brother thus Odins son. In Addition there was this scene in GOW 4, in which Kratos was talking to the Ghost of Athena, who told him that he is not a father. Which might mean he is not meant to raise a child but could also mean that he is indeed not atreus father.
Did anybody notice the difference of the water
Can you kill something that big' kratos' bruh
I hope this would be released for Pc.
This is just amazing
3:04 feels like GOW X Horizon
Me: I can’t beat this boss can you do it please  My older brother: 2:50
I liked Atreus in the last game. I hope he's not as annoying as he is in this trailer throughout the game
When I workout, I put this on.  Testosterone increase over 9000*
Wonder what's Surtur doing right now
Atreus will be the cause of his father's death, and remember my words well
Still waiting....
Release?
“Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general”  “Ever been to Greece before boi?” “No?!” “Exactly”
hope there will be more qte in this game
Is anybody else seeing that that centaur creature might be Freya? Or is it just me
I'd buy a ps5 just for that
I want this game to have a scene where Thor, or Odin find out Kratos is the son of the great Zeus and I want to see their reaction. This is my only request.
Bayonetta 3 will be the better combat experience, this with Elden ring is going to be a interesting goty year.
Mimir: te contare esta historia mas tarde
That shot of Tyr standing up and Kratos looking up at him and then the music swelling... *Chef's Kiss*
Would like to see Current Kratos vs Past Kratos, like a sort of battle with inner self. Not sure how that’d happen but it would be something.
تم تختيم الجزء السابق مليون مره🙃🙃
1:37 is Atreus wearing a piece of kratos OG fit?!
i got ragnorok winter is coming
Lenda
The only thing I'm dissapointed in is that I have both a PS5 and a high powered PC. The PC version of GoW 2018 with all the graphics setting to max 4k, blows even the ps5 out of the water. So for all intents and purposes, the 2018 GOW on PC is going to look much better than this new game that is only coming to the PS4 and 5 as of right now. IDK why Sony has to make PC gamers wait. I hope it's not 4 years like it was for the original.
I think they should’ve save the blades of chaos for this one instead they decided to show them in 2018.
Man look at those graphics... Santa Monica Studio is living in 2060
gow 3 kratos : i will have my revenge   gow ragnarok kratos : war is not the only way
So I'm new to GOW, But I had a thought. Is Thor's mom ever named? Could Faye be Thor's and Atreus's mom?
진짜 갓오브워 때문에 플스 샀다
2018 loki voice was better i believe 💔
3:05 Hum Atreus Girlfriend.
It looks like 2018 game
This........ is........ kratos........... being..............................................(wispers) reasonable
Stupid trailer 👀💯
Where is the house
in case Kratos(and BOI) is killing another pantheon, i think it would be a great idea to bring back his old leitmotif, maybe with a couple twists idk, just an opinion of mine that i wanted to put out there
Ah yes, calm and reasonable person simulator
Imagine showing this someone in 2013.
Welp rip freya
Is this a netflix touch with the girl at this end?
Holy Shitballs, I already bought it, but gotta wait till release. Definitely want it . Gonna be incredible, so glad that they kept Mimir!! :) and Freya is definitely gonna be right after Thor. Like running into two freight trains.
His son is the final enemy
Your get your answers soon enough well most of them
Are u coming with us
Thor and Odin nice
I dig 11 months in, 2 from release that we know almost nothing. Rare to see this
Imagine a Tyr spin off game
Atreus spin off games I can't wait Sony is smart they know what their doing let's gooo🔥🔥🔥🖤🐐💯
I like how kratos shows up in the scene horns like marvel loki
Kratos will now face his most challenging quest in his life rasing a emo teenager.
Oh, that "NO" was instant when Atreus said "start thinking like a general" cause Kratos knows all too well how that'll end, absolutely love it
Cant wait to use spartan calm  And blades of reasonable
Bro legit can't wait for the release and I play on pc so I gotta wait longer 😭 but I legit can't wait 🤩🤩🤩 looks freakin awesome
Well gents time to kill Thor
Didn't fenrir bite tyr's arms off ?
This trailer really came out almost a year ago?!?!
guess freya found her warrior spirit again after all. makes me wonder if she found it on her own or if she cut a deal with odin, considering we DID murder his son
What is a black girl doing in this game
🔥🔥
I can’t believe there gonna kill off kratos  Or Atreus will
"We will stop ragnarök peacefully,.....with force." -Kratos
Woow I can’t wait
I have a feeling Loki will be last boss 🤔
Y'all notice how the start of this game at atreus just shows up with a deer, they didn't haft to go huntin or nothin
were getting closer
Tyr: Stands up several heads taller than Kratos  Kratos: You’re big. I've fought bigger
Try don't need no ladder that is for sure
why does teenage Atreus look like one of those dudes from the crazy russian memes
"boy"
They release pc?
Ngl, this trailer brought a Tyr to my eye
me wtching it but i cant even afford it
1:46 is that was battletoads?
존나 재밌겠는데 시발 플스가없네
1:34 that odin's statue above?
I wish in this game atreus sees kratos past so he understands why is he against violence
skoupidi
Game of the year 2022 comfirmed!!
Really cant wait to become Calm and reasonable person.
It’ll be awesome to fight alongside Tyr!
1:32
Keep going never lose hope in life don’t give up you are loved! ❤️
Please when is it November
Boi is all grown up now
Kratos will never think again  like a General
Odin, Loki, Asgard this seem like marvel
I think kratos can beat everyone in the realms.. because his  power is stenght..... not lightning or thunder LIKE THOR or whatever.. but STRENGHT...  he is so strong he can lift up amd trow rocks of 10.000 tons 🤣  after all Zeus is his father..
Ah yes, an African girl in the middle of ancient Scandinavia
Can we jump tho ?
Kratos: War is not the only way  It seems Kratos is borrowing a lesson from Tyr from GoW 2018
this game just makes you feel on top of the  world haahah
Cannot wait for November to come this game looks amazing
Very cool from Ukraine
Who is the guy at the end, tall guy
Will the games that came to PS5 also come to PS4?
Man the music after 2:10 goosebumps.. cannot wait to play this.
If you pause at 1:35 you'll notice the Cracks in the Blades of Chaos are more than before or it's just a part of Game. I wonder what happens if they get destroyed or Break. I hope that doesn't happen
3:06 Oh no, they had to add "diversity" into it.
may i know why is this age restricted?
Tyr has same eyes as mimir
"War is not the only way" What a ...character development...
I half expect for Thor to be Chris Hemsworth.
Calling it now…Odin is the final boss
I just hope my 3050 can take it
Definitely unhealthy the amount of times I've watched this
Wait will ragnarok happen in game orrr???
After leaving the reality zero and got back to he’s reality
Maybe that’s what’s mother want  You do not know what mother wanted   It’s makes my day 😂😂😂
BGMI Baap hai sbka 😈😈
Still debating about whether to buy this. Im more of an jrpg guy though I hated Elden ring.
I don’t know why this annoys me so much but the axe is glitching through the blades when he’s jumping into the boat. …
Remember when Baldur said "I thought you'd be bigger. "   Maybe he was confusing Kratos for Tyr cause they're both the Gods of War
back again for my usual fix. One thing i love is how kratos does not speak much throughout but every word is impactful and quote worthy.
is it me or am i the only one who is waiting for santa  monca to release another video of gameplay or teaser trailer???
That girl at the end of the trailer felt SO out of place. Token character? Or maybe someone from Egypt, since Tyr was  stated to have been there... Guess we'll wait and see.
I don't have ps5 i just have ps4 i want to play this game
Kratos: "War is not the only way" People who played other parts and know kratos: This man is kidding.
The "boy" has grown up and have a bolder voice
2:21 that's mothaf*ckin demon crocodile or Demongator
If i buy this game...The main reason will just be for Kratos Vs Thor
I just realised boy has a mount les go
The latest one is one of my favorite games and the only reason why I bought a PS4 Pro. Now I have to buy the PS5 in order to play this. I cannot wait!
I hope they have Kratos’ original VA voice a character or something. They did him dirty tbh
IMA BUY THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY DEC 6
That "think like a General" line hits real deep for Kratos
Why kratos voice sound different if they got a new voice actor L
Can't wait to see Kratos parenting skills when Atreus discovers the internet...
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  Ummm thor are we talking about the same person here?
to write a game, you gotta read like a doctors degree
movie writers read so much, games writers read so much
WE ARE ART
Playstation is knowledge
This better not be as disappointing as Jotunheim. I'm still hyped though!
Ok crazy theory but what if we there was a moment in the game where we wielded mjolnir I mean it's almost parallel to blade of Olympus the blade banished giants and the hammer kind of banished the giants I hope there would be a moment in the game where we wield it and where in the new game + we would be able to wield it through the whole entire thing again
i dont wanna say it, but id like to see the blades of chaos break.
please no upgreid leviathan axe please
This 2022?
Pleas make movie
The Best Ever: PlayStation Exclusive Trailer, Video Game Trailer, etc.
1000% gonna win game of the year again
What are the chances we get a boss fight with Thor right out the gate. Picking up where GOW4 left off
Kratos definitely came for peace instead of acting towards war. Makes you wander if something’s going to make kratos snap and go back to his old ways? Especially since I heard there’s going to be another installment after Norse mythology which is to end the franchise…
Im happy mimir stays with kratos and Artemis as 1 of the main characters
I just noticed that for most of the trailer he uses his blades instead of his axe
THIS GAME IS GONNA BE EPIC!!!!
"Keep your expectations low boy and you'll never be disappointed."                                                     -Kratos
they're gonna kill Kratos.
🔥🔥
Three months. I can’t wait. All ready have it pre ordered on my console. Also can’t wait to hear what the rendition of the main theme for the GOTY medley.
I like how in a lot of video game cutscenes main characters get beat up but kratos just fricking murders everybody
The trailer getting better and better than the other one
I take the fact game will be released on my birthday as a sign I will play it so I can help Kratos and Atreus face the end of their journey in Midgard and fight Thor.
They avoided it for so long in this series but it looks like they couldn't keep it going. They had to put a black in their game, I wonder how many black characters are in Norse mythology eh?
I'm really not used to hearing Thor that doesn't have an Australian accent
Gonna be a op game
i love you kratos❤
Guys Japan and Egypt might be next by the slightest change its just a guess
The graphics are the same but it’s understandable that they couldn’t improve on perfection
So what’s next Kratos Vs Egyptian or Aztec Gods
I still think showing Tyr should've left unspoiled
Don't be sorry, be better 🔥👌
When the devs love creating games
I just noticed mimir has both his eyes!!!!
can we kill thor now?
1:49 is that Atreus using mini Blades of Chaos in the background?
I hope there aren't a bunch of long movies to watch. I hate having to sit there not playing the video game. Haha
Ok so imagine if you can chop off pieces of ppl based on when you open or close the shield?...kinda like a bear trap.
Are u coming with us
Are you coming with us
Literally tyr impressing how powerful and big he is   Bro kratos fight every giant
What did a black lady forget in Scandinavia, early centuries?
“Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general”  Kratos: Spartan Rage Available Press L3+R3
After watch entire trailer, oh boi my body start strembling
Florida be like
Pre order gang wya?
Odins whole plan in my last post
Freya must've broke the spell. Or maybe not.. and that's why he blocked it.
🔥
Just take my money
03:04 Taqueesha Laqueesha from Holy Wood, old scandinavian goddess of s h a m e and d i v e r s i ty! Nice!
one month to go
Whenever I see this trailer I feel like a calm and reasonable person
Game of decade 100%
This video is 10 months ago please realese in India
Who’s the girl at the end of the trailer I’m curious, anyone?
"War is not the only way" I can't see the kratos of the earlier GOW games saying this. He really has got some character developments.
I thought this game would let you take over as Atreus n begin a brand new adventure.  Would of been more pleasing to the buyer/gamer
Mimir and tyr got the same kind of eyes
I'm beyond hyped for this and I'm really glad Mimir is back he was awesome
No matter how many times I rewatch this trailer it still gives me goosebumps. My body mind and soul are ready.
Let’s not forget that Loki is already technically also a father in this game. The world serpent and fenrir the wolf. Time isn’t linear as explained in the last game, fenrir bit tyres hand off! You can see it’s missing in this trailer :)
Only issue is it looks the exact same as 2018
bruh why is this age ristricted
Pc?
I have began to play GOW and I must say it really is amazing can't wait for this one
Cant wait BOY!!!!
Are you a calm and reasonable person? 1:57
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person." Kratos "..."  We can conclude, Thor is delusional.
who is she 3:06 ?
I now  you will make fun of mine but i want this game to come on PC do you agree?
“In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it, let it serve you”.
Atreus has grown up
GOW is most definitely my favorite game at the moment.
So excited 😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
LETS GO BOYS I GOT A JOTUNN EDITION
Can’t wait to see the son power 💯
The voice of Kratos is perfect !
I know this is crazy but I'm just saying: I think that the clothes kratos is wearing in the beginning is thor's clothes...............
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person." *Kratos flash backs to snapping the neck of Thor's brother.*
Man i wish i was Atreus :/
1:57 Kratos had a flashback for  second there
When Tyr Stoodup...  The Disrespect for Kratos😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do the blades of chaos truly belong to loki
War is not the only way
This looks sick! I am gonna buy it when it releases
Can’t wait for November tho
Thor- bring me kratos ⚡
"Stop thinking for a father for a moment and start thinking like a general..." Oooo boy Atreus you don't have the slightest of an idea what Kratos can do if he starts thinking like this.........
We need that
“Father when can i leave to be on my ownnn”
Still rewatching it
Atreus: Why do you keep clutching your left hand? Tyr: Dont know....been feeling weird lately
Winter comes for asgard👀
Only kratos would crack a man horse body shouts
It's so sad seeing Freya as our enemy, I get it we kill her son. But cmon he was a maniac who tried to kill you.
With how the foliage looks behind  Angrboda, I'd have to say that that's Vannaheim
I should buy ps4 for play this game.
Matheus terá uma namorada? Nosso GAROTU cresceu 😢
Atreus better be less cocky and annoying
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Bro boy said stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general he does not want kratos to start thinking like a general
follow me for more games updates
gimme
Is it available on PS4?
Unfortunately I can't play this game because Steam is blocked in Indonesia
I'm just glad the put some DIVERSITY into it, I mean what would a game about European mythology be without black women
Looks like a calm and reasonable person.
Just came back here to see the trailer after Finally Beating GoW on PC. I have it on PS4 but I don't know why I never finished it. But better late than never and cannot wait to get the game on PS5
HYPE.
Blackwitch fight together with kratos 👀
Is @Darlynsjacques:MaMa in it
BRO I HAVE TO WAIT 3 MONTH JUST TI PLAY IT WHY
Makes me wish I owned a PS5 instead of the series s my goodness it looks beautiful
Game of the year already
Wait Tyrr Is Still Alive?
Wonder if that was Thud or Angrboda at the end
This will be the best game to ever come out mark my words
Gal sabar
Looks the graphics are insane. I think worth every cent
Best game of the year hands down
Looks like were going to get some new weapon he smashed something on the ground
I cannot be either calm nor reasonable while waiting for tis game!
Kratos looks more older and weak 😢
November cannot get here any sooner.
Can't wait to spend 15+ hours fighting whoever they have that is the equivalent of Valkyrie queen
@Beth:If everyone sent me a dollar on the video I could buy a home for my children to have a bedroom $loveme422 just one dollar I will be so greatful!! 🥰🥰

The one video i wont dislike. 🤷
Kratos is not killing thor He helping the Asgard to stop the ragnarock
2:50
I love everything except that they made a Norse Goddess black, Norse people are white as snow
Bruh, as soon as this game comes out, I'm buying it, I don't care how much it costs
I hope we get a bigger variety of bosses in this one than the previous
Why does Tyr have both hands?
I'm trashed
Wey va a estar buenísimo.
This is a biblical moment for us gamers. Thor's voice just reaffirmed I'm buying this game.
Crazy how Mimir is still alive. In the last game he said he was a rotting head. Clearly it's been years due to Atreus's development plus the winter. Ig we'll have to see what happens. CANT WAITTTTT🔥🔥🔥
Please 😢add Kazakhstan region so we can buy games🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿❤️
this black girl feels out of place and forced to force diversity and politics downour throats .
2:53 tomar and his wife
Atreus don't betreus
buying a ps5 just for this game ngl
I see mc from vinland saga in here, after so many war, many people he kill and destroy home's of hundreds people. mc back to his hometown and become a peaceful man,who doesn't want to kill or even fight anymore. but someday he facing big problem that make him awaking his old self to survive and protect his people's....
I wonder if tir will meet mimir and get his body back
Thor: Are You a Calm and Reasonable Person ?  Kratos: Yes.  Thor and Kratos talking with each other, shake hands and leave  Ending
Epic
Where is 3d audio for 5.1 surround speakers ?. Almost 2 years now and still this feature is not here. Physical speaker cost a lot so please Sony, give us the premium 3d audio soon
POV:Kratos says war is not the only way
Oh cool, a nordic ethnic child for the murdering
Aww I was hoping Mimir would've turned out to be Tyr.
Ooof I cannot fu@!$*g wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will it be on ps4??
Can't wait to pirate this game.
YESIR
Have the dwarves make Mimir a magical body
So excited to see the old GOW weapons back to being used
where are kratos old weapons he got in greece after killing gods are they hidden somewhere
Every release has been phenomenal I hope for the very besr
Father son simulator
why;d they add a black person?
I just have to know, is that the same wolf that Hulk Fought in Thor Ragnarok 👀
I hope they release it in ps4 to
Someone showing his fckin hammer to kratos.
I can't wait to feel like a calm and reasonable person
I preordered this yesterday! I can’t wait! I’ve played the game before this twice and almost beat all the Valkyries
Ok this is now just marvel at this point
game of decade for sure
Finally tyr (undertaker) meet kratos (goldberg) 😂
can you guys imagine, Kratos traveling to egypt. The endless possibilities are blowing up my mind.
I went with xbox this generation, but my ps4 still works so I'll get it on that
Looks great, but I'm a bit sad they didn't start this as  a PS5 only project, one can only imagine what it would look like in that case.
The only game that stands a chance vs Elden Rings in 2022.
That woman at the end is said to be Loki's future wife and jormungandr's mother :0
Never thought I‘d say that but pls butcher Thor as brutal as possible 😂
Please don’t rush this game, true fans don’t give af
I like how Kratos is trying to avoid war, it shows he's come along way.
Boy bring me milk
This game looks great. Wow.
16 million's is coming
I can’t wait to play this game
Olympian sword will be in the game along with boots of hermes... in NG+
This is gonna be epic.
Thank you Sony, Thank you Santa Monica
Sweet cheeses Tyr is a tall boi
1:53 stop thinking like a father for a moment start thinking like a general 😡  🙄You would't want that boy
เงียบ​ที่สุด​ใน​ชีวิต​
1:41 Timothy lives!
When this game will be release?
My only complaint is that the game is on at Gorey visually as it once used to be on PS2 and PS3
1:57 that is a face of a father with too many belts on
" the wrong one".
Odin hunts him because he has his true son.thor is kratos true son. Deimos and kratos .
It’s sad cause the prophecy must be complete, in the last game that ends with Kratos 😭
you seem like a calm and reasonable person * equips spartan calm and blades of reason *
Things about this Trailer I am extremely excited about: Mimir Svartalfheim Tyr The Return of Executioners Cleave (by far my favorite move) Literally everything else
Nays wow
…there goes my social life and my job….again
We want a PC version.
Come here boooy !!
RAGNAROK is coming....and winning GOTY!!!! This looks unbelievable even months after its release!  The graphics The music The dialogues!!!!   BRING ME RAGNAROK!!!!!
AREEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS ZEEEEEEEEEEUUUUSSSS
Gonna be my favorite game of the year tho plus I already got it pre ordered tho from gamestop so now just gotta pick it up
If only I could get a retail priced ps5 2 years after the launch to fully enjoy this game. We will see. Game looks amazing as the series usually does
L3 + R3 🤩
Ok that kid is still annoying
What the N word doing there
THE BOYS ALL GROWN AHHHHHHH
I see he got that deer on his own now lol
"In the moment of crisis, panic does nothing..harness it. Let it serve you." 🔥 -Kratos
ITS NOT TYR ITS ODIN RIGHT 😡😡
Kratos then: “I BRING THE DESTRUCTION OF OLYMPUS!!!!”  Kratos now: “War is not the only way…”  Sounds like a man who understands the toll that war and combat has on people and the world. Impressive character development.  EDIT: It’s here, my friends.
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you.
I have to have this game. No question. Its going to be a preorder for sure
Who is the girl though ? Is she the future wife of Loki ?
Tyr bigger than kratos 😂
#1 graphics
This is way better that mortal Kombat!⛓💀🔥
I love that the blades will be used for traversal, that's a cool mechanic.
im bald
pls release i pay 70 dollars pls pls pls pls i want to rip thors eyes out
I love how kratos doesn't want to go back to his old roots the way he says no when boy says act like a general instead of a father
Got platinum trophy yesterday and PlayStation gave me 20% off on ragnarok pre order 👌
"Stop thinking like s father for a moment, and start thinking like a general" Do you really want to see it or do you want to be traumatized
Hold on, so Tyr is the last known living giant? Besides Jörmungandr of course, and Atreus I guess
Love the beginning where Atreus brings in the deer and the antlers foreshadow Loki
I bet tyr is Odin all along
please croatian titlovi
Going for a collectors edition!! Peace <33333333333333333333333333
👍🏻😀
BEST GAME EVER
They showed way too much
The game that made all kids feel like Men
Not enough Ragnarök. Need more destruction.
Best game ever created 💯
who is the girl at the end?
Seen a notifcation for pre order I wasnt even aware they made a sequal
Seeing Kratos go from angry shouty man to giving useful advice and harsh truths about life to Atreus is truly incredible. He has indeed come a long way.
Let me get this straight... you added scorpions mortal kombat chains to kratos.  I F in love this series.
I hope kratos becomes like immortal or something
Nah I’m gonna need this game
Hmmm? Can anyone tell me if  the girl is she black or native. And if maybe we will be going other places since u know most characters are meant to be “whiiiite”. Asking cuz I would love if an Aztec character popped out
War is not the answer. How ironic.
2:45,I feel he is ODIN disguised as TYRE.
Wish it wasn't only on ps5
Kratos with a cape  KRATOS WITH A CAPE
Rip pc
The musical score at the end really makes this trailer. Those horns sound epic
I'm not the only one with goosebumps right???? Wooooo, I can't wait
I just want that Boi finaly find out about Kratos past life and all he did and second would be nice to see real Kratos fight in the end game and aim for Thor's head  😅
Hype
THOR : You seem like a calm and reasonable person
Are they hinting egypt? Or another continent?
anybody know if the american version have portugues language?
When you're low-key Loki.
Excited for this game I am waiting for Thor entry
Why does Týr have 2 hands ?
Him saying “You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Idk why but that made me crack up 😂
We need GOW series on Netflix
If enemies is not repetitive there , this game is great
Playing through GOW I look forward to seeing Thor get what's finally coming to him. Killing all those giants and that spirit's mother who made a Thor statue.
Looks freakin great love it already!!!
'War is not the only way' coming from Kratos really means a lot
One thing I hope they don’t do in this game is recycle animations and character models
0:57
Bro Loki sounds like a femboi 🤦🏾‍♂️
I hope Atreus’s new teenage voice does not get annoying, and I hope he still has his kind nature
This is not just a game  This is a history ❤️
It would be nice to have ps5's available.
i wonder if the plan to do another game after this to finally go on a killing spree with Atreus. I hope that happens this game but who knows
I’m here for it
the American accent makes feel it's just a American Pie comedy movie about growing up and sexual requirements.
Yo whats with the african?
They should have just made it an expansion at this point
"War is not the only way" Kratos has definitely become a calm and reasonable person. He's tired of war. He came to midgard definitely to find peace. Start a new life. Only if baldur hadn't showed up. What a character development
How many people saw that he actually looked at the camera in the beginning of the video?
Weird to go the Netflix route for that one character design, but I guess that's just the 2020's, eh?
I NEED that song when mimir shows
Atreus is plain annoying to me since he figured out about him and kratos being gods
Atrues - " stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like general "  Kratos - " Boy , have i ever told you why i have a pale skin ? "
Brigado Playstation
“are you a calm and reasonable person”  1:57
i guess my dream of kratos marrying freya is never gonna come tru </3
“You seem like a calm and reason-“ “I cut off Hermes legs then proceeded to kill him and steal his shoes.”
Well... let's hope they don't come up with a pricing strategy similar to the Nintendo switch exclusives for this one...
Did anybody else notice Kratos's voice got even deeper?
Just me or that shield just changed
Centaurs????
Is that The Storm breaker?
David Jaffe really said this look like a DLC... man I like the guy but his click baiting looks desperate
2:52 - 3:00 Still Remember How I jumped on my bed when it appeared during Playstation showcase.
Mimir really thought that freya was gonna come around….that’s a negative
I pray they do a PC port again 😩
Can't wait
This is definitely gonna be worth getting if mimir can tell more stories while were traveling
Who's the girl though?🙂
Looking forward to play…
Loki's nose is to big
Got my collectors edition preordered ready for November
3:00 what is zendaya doing in this game!?
The opening is probably the opening scene in the game, calling it now
If there’s one improvement to gameplay I want is to bring in Weapon based R3 finishers. I feel like how you can activate runic powers by hitting precision axe throws if like to see them expand that so you could put together sick kill chains with weapon executions not just the hands.
1:57 Kratos almost pulled out the belt of chaos .
Elden Ring and now this. Game of the year gonna be crazy
Binod
Binpd
Can't wait to use the Blades of Chaos again in GOW Ragnarok
So is Kratos going to keep shouting Boy
Is this unreal 5?
Is there a reason there's a black girl at the end? I sincerely hope they aren't going to start on the blackwashing of European culture bandwagon, too. Imagine for one second they did this to some black folklore, there'd be wall to wall outrage. Bit racist.
Just got a PS5. November can't come soon enough.
I just worry about kratos end
0:22 is that foreshadowing?
What are they doing with the games. These games are basically showing the same thing and nothing has changed
awesome a black girl in norse mythology that makes sense all you have to do is look at swedish and danish and norwegians to know how dark they are XD
Who's back here after scoring their collectors edition/Jotnar editions?
I hope there’s no Valkyrie Queen
Can’t take Thor seriously with the beer gut the boss fight will be funny 😂
Oh boi, I can't wait!
yo WHOS VOICE SAID ARE YOU A CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON
I really hope tyr gets his hand bit off by fenrir and get's tyrfing to fight with
I cannot wait to (watch other people) play this!!!
"we're trying to stop Ragnarok" every Ragnarok always starts from that line
Odin's got tricks up his sleeve, we haven't dared to consider
I am kumo ☺
Kwatooos
I wished they didnt reveal Tyr Being alive tbh it would have been amazing
Rewatching this trailer for 10th time after preordering Jotnar edition
my prediction is   kratos and thor will fight and they will become ally and will gift storm breaker to kratos  what do you think ?
Can i play this on ps4?
Atreus sounds like Tom Holland.
Ooo this is gonna sell out fast in stores lol
The fact that the Yotnar version is fully sold out on the market leads me to believe that all of the scalpers have gotten their hands on them. They think they're smart, just like with the PS5. The fact that they sell it for more than three times the market value makes what is terrible and pitiful. Any retailer, including Gamestop, Best Buy, Playstation, and others, has the power to halt and cancel orders for copies that are being delivered to the same address. However, they don't since they might make more money from the scalpers. The economy as a whole suffers when the market is inflated to unrealistic proportions, in addition to the players' wallets. Naturally, it goes without saying that all of those legitimate stores have complete plans to "restock" before launching in an effort to fleece the scalpers while doing their "BEST" to supply the player directly. It is clearly flawed in its launch, which just irritates me. Try harder. Shame on you, you scumbags. Kratos would be angry with you, boy! Trying to remember what Kratos said in a time of need "In moments of crisis, panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you".
I am hyped
I’m calling this now. When we left Mimir with the dwarves he said they “took measurements” I bet you they are going to construct a new body for him. Like a dwarves mech of some kind :p
Preordered this morning when I was on break
I'm so excited! And I just can't hide it!.. I know I know I want you, I want you!!!
I want to know about Faye. I hope Ragnarok features her.
What I find more hilarious is that they put a black character in it's just for the sake of diversity
Jotnar Edition ordered from Best Buy, let's go!
Ruined at the end
1:55 last time Kratos thought like a general he made the Greek Pantheon, Panthegone.
Don't really care until it comes to PC, after the console peasants pay to beta test the game for us that is.
Bruh please for pc please
is the game going to be ps4/ps5 exclusive? or better buy a PC????????
when you will make a movie like come on already this man needs a movie you guys have the money spend the money and make y’all make a billion dollars please make it
666k like noice
Back for my daily dose of epic.
Hi🧡
How old is ATREUS?
I thought Tyr was missing a hand? Interesting…
I hope we get new weapons.
Hope we get to see Kratos actually go all out!
This game has to be voted one of the best if all time considering how it's developed
Who else wants to see mimir with a body?
I love the small details depicting the growth of the characters. Especially atreus
Its nice when you have immortal head as accecories
we should get to see some more weapon verity right?
Hopefully the focus is still on kratos and not on Atreus,
LOVE IT!
Yes
Definitely not at all what I expected…
You can change the shield ?
This going to be so badass
119 days left. I'm a calm and reasonable person ʘ‿ʘ
Mimir is still part of the family on Kratos' hip, I have gotten my only request for this game. Long live Mimir, co parenting right alongside Kratos.
I saw everything I needed to see I know where the REAL tyr is😉jourmangandrs wrath and mimirs secrets
بهترین بازیه تاریخ کل دنیا هستش
shivering in my boots im so excited
Watch kratos kill everything 😂
Atreus sounds like sora now
ANGRBODA!! Loki's wife in the real mythology!
I wish the axe still looked like the maximum upgrade. It looked so beautiful and now I feel as though my grinding was for nothing since I’m back to step one
Unfortunately, this game has become similar to many games such as assassin's creed and viking. We are used to the fierce Kratos, Zeus and Athena. It was a fierce, distinctive and very strong game, and now it is a hunter whose movements are very slow.
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a second and start thinking like a general.  Kratos: ATREUS! BRING WAR WITH ASGARD, AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!
2:00
On ps4 😝
Theory on how Kratos will beat Odin: He will destroy Thor, equip his gauntlet and Mjolnir. And the gauntlet doubles Thor's strength, imagine kratos with double strength
“Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general”  Boy if you only knew the horrors.
Thor: you seem like a calm reasonable person  Kratos: Wouldn’t you wanna know weather boy
Well gotta wait for pc release after 5 years.
Yes yes yes yes yes yessssssss!!!!! Finally all the gore i wanted from the original series with more characters
Whose ready to fight 1 boss over and over!
That girl at the end looks like the girl in polar express
I thought Freya was unable to physically or magically harm any living creature?
tyr is old gow so he can fight
Weak...
Since Freya brought Mimir to life with his head maybe she will bring back to life Baulder bc when Kratos snapped his neck Freya  carried Baolder body and went with him
Tyr gonna betray us
I wonder if Mimir will reclaim his body or get a new one in this game?
I like that Kratos is making arrows for his son
We are ready to Harness the crisis GIVE US THE GAME ALREADY!!!!!!
Very nice
Gow background music is awesome 😍💗🚫
cant wait for 5 years when it launches on pc
My guess is Kratos will not kill thor do to thor being relevant right now. That is all.
it seems that this game is going far away from its way.
Just let us use Odin’s Spear and Thor’s Hammer pls
Finale?
I hope this comes on the ps4 too I don’t have a ps5
Faya still hasn’t found her wings yet🤣🤣🤣
Look repetitive, like every game before it . Why is the boy not the main character to play with . We’ve seen all that Kratos can do now
I can play it on ps4pro
GOW is BEST game
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 can’t wait
Looks like more of the last game, but better. Which is fine by me. And it looks like we're finally gonna get to fight Thor. I hope we'll also get to at least see Odin too. Also seems as if Freya will be an antagonist, which makes sense considering her threats towards Kratos near the end of the last game.
Wait a second...ARE THOSE THE BLADES OF CHAOS!?!?!?
After seeing that solid 4/10 Thor movie - Cory coming in and DELIVERING as per usual, my man 🙌
We are going to war with Asgard babe. Bring it on
I am so fukn excited.
Am I only one impressed by how they timed every action with the rhythm of the second half of the trailer.
awesome 👍
Forced in black love interest just because? Yea so hyped…
When we can play?
Perhaps thor isn't a so-called " calm and reasonable person "
Kratos vs thor I am exited
I am so excited to play:)
I like to game. have a Amazing graphic this game
Killing the gods?  Easy  Getting over the loss of your wife?  Easy   Raising Atreus as a teen? Uh oh
wait is that thor standing up ?!
cant wait
I swear it will be the best game on playstion 4 and 5!!
It sounds like Tom Holland voice
I know they improved the graphics and all that, but seeing how much they did so long ago, really makes you realize how big the game is going to be.
Ooh what's the lore behind African character is she from the next pantheon kratos will topple?
Ye
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person" is a great line, but if you played the original games it's just a whole other level of incredible.
Is this a DLC? Don't tell me this an whole new game
Im really curius will we get the runic attacks of the last game? I really like them, well some of them
Atreus will end up fighting his dad
In the words of kratos. *”Again.”*
WRRRROGH RRAGHH WORRRRAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA GAAAAAAAAAA UUUUUUGWAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHHH GWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Santamonica pls take up as much time as necessary to make this masterpiece....
Anyone else notice that in most of the shots possibly at the beginning of the game kratos doesn’t have the blades of chaos with him or the chains on his wrists (this just popped into my head so I’m rolling with it )
זה יוצא רק לסוני 5 או גם ל 4 ?
Man i wish they release it for pc
I predict this game ends with Kratos wielding Mjolnir and I can f..ing wait
So at 2:26 to 2:28 top right corner, it looks like a dark elv is fighting another human character??? Anybody else see that??
I want to see ruthless and furious kratos in game not son loving father ❤️👍
No excuse why this isn't releasing on PC.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Release the game and you’l see how calm and reasonable i can be.
After Kill so many gods and people....  Also kratos - WAR IS NOT THE ONLY WAY
Idk who’s voice that was when saying calm and reasonable hope it’s Thor. But who it is sounds menacing
I want to play this
They should have brought back pandora as a scarred surprise for kratos
Kratos: Are you coming with us?
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"   He won't be such a calm and reasonable person if that happens
i want to see jacksepticeye play this !! 🔥
Oh this made a recap of our history lesson our teacher taught us
Who else had to come rewatch this after the release date was announced.
" War is not the only way " " I will not let you fight the gods " Says kratos who soloed all the Olympius God's Because of revenge and raged a huge war because of it 😂
hope we get this on pc to so i can play this gem myself instead of watching someone playing it
Who is the man in last
That scene is the best scene in gow ever it has so much means to it😹😹1:55
Has anyone watched this trailer 5 times or more
I need it
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos:L3+R3
Not long now guys… 4 months
If kratos stopped thinking like a father then we all know what would happen🥶🤌🏻
The foreshadowing for loki in the beginning tho 👌
1:57 Okay sir I’m sorry sir please don’t kill me sir
kratos is back
Hype
only just now realizing Atreus is wearing Kratos' spartan robes around his waist
I come from the future! This game finally has a release date! November 9th, 2022!
I need deimos back ;_;
No new weapons no nothing they really have given up.
When you are at your weakest. Fear and doubt, have become to heavy to bear. Remember this - *You are not alone*!
Cant wait to see the calm and reasonable side of kratos this game 🙌   Can smell game of the year
i hate they change actor who plays atreus
Finally... Some inclusion
*Thor:* Are you a calm and reasonable person? *Kratos:* I am the Ghost of Sparta *Thor:* 👁👄👁 💀
fking age restricted video xd ty youtube welp gotta go watch it from my mums phone feel like a ten year old
We are close, i have very high expectations for the game so i hope this turns out to be more than a Rehashed GOW 2018 or a Dlc like game with 2 or 3 new features compared to the last game.
They try to stop Ragnarok also director said Ragnarok will come that mean they will fail
I guess Atreus suddenly becomes American , the accent doesnt even sound ancient
yup back in here again after the announcement
09/11/2022.
after release date , you are still here again Champ lolx
Can't wait to see what this Tomb Raider Ragnarok is all about!
11.09.22
The most important thing I want is that fur coat at the beginning to be in game armor
Doidin pra chegar❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
11.09.2022 is the day!
I cant believe people really had a fit over Angrobodas skin color.
November 9 2022 let’s gooooo!!
gonna grab my ps5 tomorror and stare at it everyday until that game arrives
Who's back from the new trailer?
Lol
Tyr, noice
More fights more stories more characters to meet YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS CORY AND THE TEAM I LOVE YOU
Booiii
Favourite game in so many years
I was hoping that boy would finally become less annoying but it turns out a teenage boy is probably going to be even more annoying.. question after question knowing that kratos his dad is never really much on answers why does he keep asking
Santa Monica, we need more unique boss fights and enemy variety. That’s all! 🙏
i really hope this comes on pc i don't want to buy a ps5
Not long now
I get my answers on November 9
The best things about this game we can see from the trailers: True number 1. More Kratos  1. Mimir 2. Boy turned into Man 3. Fenrir( he looks so fckin cool) 4. Everything else
The fight scenes is soooo satisfying 🔥💙
This is basically just the Prophecy of Ragnarok from Norse Mythology with like 2 differences. A. Kratos and Atreus didn’t exist and B. Tyr would have been missing an arm by now.
I'm so excited bro
I can't be the only one who comes back to rewatch this every month or so cause it give me literal goosebumps everytime I watch it.
Came here after watching the recent trailer I’m more excited for this game now
Al fin DLC OLD GEN y su mejor versión para PC 🥱 Se queda fuera del Goty nada que hacer para la Prensa.
This reminds me of the trailer for a freaking movie.
Thank you Cory Barlog and Santa Monica Studios. This is a masterpiece.
I love the black girl I hope it's a latrayous girlfriend 🥰
Who’s here after finding out the actual release date?? November 9th
❤️
Heeeeere we goooo!
11.09.2022, Let's go!!! 🔥
The last one was my favorite game ever. I haven't been this hyped for a game.
Sony you cheeky people I  recognize that Mortal Kombat reference at 2:05 2:06 In case you don't know what I'm talking about, in Mortal Kombat X-Mortal Kombat XL the character has a brutality witch involves his spear move, he throws 2 spears instead of 1 and both spears..... Ya know what search it up on YouTube
Okay hear me out... What if, like in the previous old GOW Games, you defeat Thor und get bis Hammer or some Kind of Power :o
Who's here after watching cinematic trailer
I just hope this game doesn't go to that woke path 🙌
Honestly this might be the only stupid that just gets better and better
Why is it not available on PC?  🥺
Who is here after realese date
Who else is coming back after watching the release date trailer???
Well it looks like a PS4 game. I'm actually disappointed...

I hope kratos will stop thinking like a father and think like a general 😈
Wow Tyr looks tall, I think it’s because his parents are giants
War is not the option says who
Don't you think kratos likes killing gods
in this game I want gow creator to show kratos's real power so all dc and Marvel fan shut up.
A ps4?
It would be very much interesting to see new death animations
வெளியிடும் தேதி என்ன தயவு செய்து சொல்லுங்க
Ps4 ?
I hope we have more Boi
1:56 I love that line
it has been an eternity and I don't care If it demands  another more but deliver the most badass game in history  I solemnly believe that this game will be awsome
I feel like this game will release during mid December to early January to sell more copies on holiday sales
I think they made atreus sound way too different I know his age but still.
still waiting for a release date pt 2
Who was that at the end with the light up eyes
2:23 Lol
I feel like this generation has seen games evolve from pixels moving on a screen to this. Man what a time to be alive
What happened too kratos from zeuusss.. your son has returned. I bring the destruction of olympus To war is not the only answer
Freaking excited to play this.🤩
I think the game will be on Christmas or at least on December because the whole Winter thing.
Almost forgot to watch this today
No one can imagine kratos saying that "war is not the only way"
Mimir being a second father to Artraiu
Angrbota: you’ll get your answers…..well some of them   Fans: WELL WE WANT THEM NOW!!😭
War is coming
When !!!!!?????
I have a modicum of faith that this game will be released in 2022.
More time keep passing by and we have yet to see a new trailer for this game, at this point this is just insane.
Who's the guy at the end?
Peak fiction
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  Kratos about to introduce Thor's face to his two best friends: "calm" and "reasonable"
but I want it NOWWWW!!
I can’t wait for this one 🥰
Can we at least get some update on this please??😓😓
nice
Is it come for ps4
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person   Kratos : until the circle button  appears
so Atreus will have a girlfriend 😉
Kratos be like:- bc uss raat muth maar leta toh achcha rehta, aaj jung karke aaraam se jeet jaata mai
I just keep watching this trailer over and over.
I beg guys. Please get it out on pc at the same release date as ps5. There no way im buying a new console to play it. I would wait. But if you did your money would be through the roof. Your other games were all mastetpieces. Do the right thing and put the masterpiece to everyone not just ppl with a console. Ps5 isnt even available here always out of stock. See to it for the players. Lets goooo. Hype
I freakin love the Scandinavian style music in this trailer
Waiting for this game to be cracked n play for free😉
“When Tyr stands up” Kratos: trust me your not that guy pal
*really want to see new gameplay c'mon S.M. show me what's new..*
Tear look like kanu rivs
I've been watching this trailer daily and I'll continue till the game comes out
Can’t wait for this beast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Really cant wait for this game really wish they didn’t spoil tyr though
Atreus gonna be op
black!
I dont understand kratos and asgard is like the same universe ? Or what ....
Tyre? 😯😯
too bad sony the king of gatekeeping games owns the franchise
Gow 2005 - war is the only option Gow 2022 - war is not a option
And they should really bring back the old weapons
it's not true !! he's still rowing upside down 1.26
I hope this time I can get the original wrist wraps instead of the leather and fer ones
😍 I might have to buy a ps4 or 5 whatever, you’re games a so much better!! Look at this!
Also again I really doubt it but I really hope we see kratos in love and thunder
I feel like in the game kratos and atreus will have a fight like a boss fight because their scenes in the trailer is them arguing
Amazing we had a fight with baldur mom idk forgot + we can ride in a ice
why don't you change that sh*tty "Play Station" sound to something more pleasing to ears.
this is like, the 20th time I've watched this waiting for the release date
Why is she black ?? In what universe did black norse women exist?
Please tell me we can hear more tales from Mimir and BRING RATATOSKR BACK, I NEED THAT BITTER SQUIREL
Tom holland's voice as atreous is just cool.
I NEEDD
Just cant wait 🕛🕛🕛🕛🕛
Thor when he sees R3 above his head: 😨😨
Gonna be looking for all Odin birds again for platinum 🙄
I got goosebumps 🙀🙀🙀
Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general Kratos: Barbarians vs Spartans flashbacks
I just hope I get to use a variety of new and unique weapons rather than the same 2 all game.
Maan that guy is tall
Tyr thinking he’s intimidating because he’s a few feet taller when Kratos has literally taken down dragons 😂😂
Release this game already.
Only Go- *ahem* Odin knows how many times I've watched this.
Hopefully they improve the graphics
Guess I got to settle with the lesser console cause they just won't show nothing at all 😮‍💨
We still didn't get no trailer for this game. At this point Im not even sure if Im going to buy the game anymore. I don't think they deserve my money for the way they been treating the fans.
Man I hate Santa Monica.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
best game ever 😍
Bruh I swear kratos is like Steven seagal there is just no killing him
Sadly we are back to this Trailer. 🤣🤣🤣
Freya is coming  Thor is coming Loki is coming  The whole Asgard is coming for kartos
In the beginning, ( 0:39 )  when Atrues is holding the stone, the cape Kratos wears looks like the one Thor was wearing in the ending of Gow 4 so I imagine Thor and Kratos will have a huge fight that destroys kratos's home which will lead them to live in that cave and also Thor drops his cape midbattle
Can't wait to forget to retrieve my Axe again.
Wait!!!! Moses Ingram is in this too?!?!
If they kill off Kratos I'll never play GOW again
Just waiting for the movie of it ofc animated
Excited
voice actor change for atreous (idk how to spell it) dont like it just sounds bad  ok thats it
I gave up on this game I got a life to live
Tyr must be about 8 and a half feet tall. Wow.
I hope the trailer gets revealed tomorrow.
is it only on ps5
I'm a huge fan of GoW. I'd put it among my favorite games of all time. And while I am super excited for this the gameplay does look extremely similar to GoW 2018. Basically a DLC level improvement rather than a sequel one. That's not necessary a problem however since the gameplay was already fantastic. I hope they introduce more interesting puzzles, enemy variety and levels however as a compensation for the small improvements in controlling Kratos.
If they kill kratos in this one then war will be the only way for me.
0:55 I wonder how they'll explain Freya being able to fight there, Mimir said she was cursed by odne to not be able to fight even to defend herself, no weapon or spell, which is why she had to use the giant in the final boss in the 2018 game
The best place to play💙
bro the new sound effect for calling back the leviathan axe
Just love the ultimate “Blade of chaos”🔥🔥🔥
As long as we get to see Fenrir devour Odin, then I will be satisfied.
I am more intresting in knowing that how faye Kratos wife looked like more than Thor wants to know that Kratos is a calm and reasonable person😂
Never expected Tyr to be a full head and shoulders taller than Kratos.
Fake
Almost 10 months and still no answers
Who’s back watching the reveal trailer after no announcement today😭
Why ! Ps4  ?
Tyr: *stands up over Kratos* Kratos: *not fazed, knowing his WORSE experiences against bigger and more dangerous giants*
gestation is over, I'm so hyped to see new stuff from ragnarok
Who came back here after no state of play was announced today? Man this is really disappointing..... I can't wait anymore.
I seriously need to play this game now
Legendary game 👍
Que jogo fantástico
Ragnarok is coming...
I hope they release it this year...can't wait. Still watching this trailer everyday day cause this is the only thing we have from it.
give us more      on pc 🤗🤗🤑🤑
Whos tyr
Can anyone tell me who is tyr because i forgot plz anyone
TANGINAAA ANG TAAGAAAAL
Sorry to Rouen your mood but their probably will be no BOY in this game u less PlayStation decides otherwise because Keaton called Atreus BOY in the last game because they had not thought of a name for Atreus yet
does this mean freya's curse is lifted? since we can clearly see she striking kratos with her sword?
That black Scandinavians is so... Typical nowadays. What's next, black Asians, or black Indians?
Sony pls give us a Date now...
2:50  KRATOS - You are not the guy pal , trust me u r not that guy
Ps4?
When does he download a game???
i bought ps5 solely for this game. i cant wait
Mimir is a bro.
PC port when?
i could see scorpion's spear..
How much longer that i waiting for this game when it will be release
😭😭😭
Tyr: *stands up* Kratos: I thought you'd be taller
15 million's is coming
LFG
I just wish i can fight Thor i got sad that I couldn’t fight him in the last game
when is the release
tyr finna sign up for the nba
The next game better be Egyptian gods , I  need him to fight Ra , or Isis
Who's that girl at the end??
2:33 another Atreus summons that players will forget to use
Players: wow! Those new skills look sick! Can't wait to try those. The same players later: R1 spam
Tyr is the same height as Kratos sitting down.
TYR??
What time release
Well, havnt finished the prequel, but I'm guessing we kill Baldur because why would Freya attack us.
A bit of wee has come out 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤣
YESSIR
Im am sick to death of waiting for news for this game, this is just beyond irritating.
óóóóó danonão grosso, tome, UUUUUUUI, CAVALO, DANÇA GATINHO DANÇA
You'll get your answers soon enough...well maybe on june 30 🥶
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you." Best games of all time. Can not wait to play this one.
I am waiting for this game
I can’t wait
I wish release this in 2022
I'd love to see them switch multiple mythologies for different GoW games.
Is it fo ps4
Tunangoja bana !!
so glad that Mimir is still be there
I wish santa monica would have waited to show this trailer in march of 2022 instead of September 2021.
1:57💀
I only wish if it were truly open world like Witcher 3. Otherwise its a masterpiece.
Kratos should start calling Atreus as "Dude" instead of "Boy" as he's a teenager now.😂
Calling it now, Thor showing up will be the reason for Kratos losing his abilities at the start of the game
June 30th, just wait.
I also saw some Aztec monsters such as the frog folk and deer centaurs, I'm guessing they're doing this is because Norse Mythology is a bit light on monsters and they don't want to repeat one of the main flaws of the last game.
i just cannot wait any longer sony, please
Artreus and angrboda the little black girl in the trailer are the parents of the world serpent
How much longer do we have to wait for this game to come out? Im getting annoyed at this point.
kratos and his sons relationship gives me the shrek and donkey vibes. i dunno if that makes sense lol
Mimir!!!!
I swear if there’s no ps4 version
The way Kratos said “No” reminds me of when Cesar said “NO” in planet of the apes. I already know GOW5 is gonna be another masterpiece.
parang etits
I’m so excited to play could’ve for Ragnarok
I’m so excited to play it
Ooooooooo meu Deus, que jogo maravilhoso se Deus quiser ainda vou comprar PS5... Dá aqui 5 anos coisa aqui Brasil é caro e o salário mínimo não da compra.. QUE OOOO JOGO SAI LOGO KKKKK PRA MIM VER VÍDEO AQUI NO YOUTUBE...
MONTAZERIM
Come on give us the release date!!!!
Oh great the botch Freya hunting our boy and our boi
fack sony every date is lie
It scares me that we're over halfway into the release year and we still don't have an actual release date yet. I have a feeling we won't be seeing this until 2023 or 2024 to be honest. I'd rather them give us a complete and polished game though and not follow the rushed and half-assed trend developers seem to be following right now.
0:53 well she looks happy to see them again.
Hoping for next week
Will this be exclusive to PS4 and PS5?
Kratos faces now the hardesr part in his life, raising a teenage boy
Release it already 😡
I genuinely can't see how people feel like this is dlc. This is a really solid trailer imo that gets me really pumped for release
It looks like they’re going to unupgrade the axe and armor which is annoying. Imagine if you could import your Kratos from GOW (2018). That would be dope
finna be the number 1 game… again
Imagine having an xbox and missing titles like this
Ragnarok trailer>cyberpunk 2077
I want this game in my life so badly
It seems the blades are being used a lot more for mobility in this game Also the shield looks like different shapes throughout the trailer
gives me chill everytime
1:56 Where are the blades of chaos?
Y’all think we’ll see heimdall
this game going to be fire
Wow... looks like a PS5 will be picked up!!!!   Along with some other games I've skipped!!
Why is she black?..
Bxnx

Gane of tbe yaer
From, "BOY" to "MAN"😢
Ring Ring I'm Tyr.
when will it release ???
Can't wait to see Chris Hemsworth 😎
Can’t see anything new here. Looks exactly like the last game…
FREYA
is air combat returning ???
Lol, tyr looks like zeuz
@3:04 So uh... even tho it goes above and beyond revisionism... Are we actually okay with Angrboda not being specifically Scandinavian? And don't bring up "b-but Mimir is Scottish/Celtic!" Nope, that was just his accent. I mean, if you remade Zeus as a pigmy or an Incan guy, it would be pretty noticeable... Is Angrboda actually going to have origins that are completely foreign to Midgard/Norway? That would sort of be a necessity at this point.
I hope that the enemy will be varied for this game. Wanted to see more variation of Norse monster.
So Thor is confirmed or….
why, WHY, WHYYYYYYYYY not release this game on ALL the platforms??? MONEY is NOT a sensible reason, sony.. just let everyone enjoy it, why make it even harder for humans than it already is... don't be greedy
I really hope the world serpent makes an appearance
Can i play this on xbox, because we don’t have any games
Black girl ? Really ! Yes , put a Chinese in Arabic mythology and white guys in Japanese mythology and black guys in viking mythology And some aliens in an African mythology  And in this way you think that you eliminate racism? You are only distorting things
I'm coming from the future this game will be nominated as the game of the year
GOW starting to lose it’s way here.. a little
I love this game
So when do you guys want my money.
Just finished beating the one before this one! What an awesome game!! I used to think games like these were lame af, turns out I was the lame one!
2:25 Deer centaur?
Winter is coming
Atreus sounds like Noah Schnapp
Just finished the previous game. Got it from ps plus. And I can't wait for ragnarok
hope i will live long enough to be able to see Kratos vs Amun Ra
I litterally cannot be more excited for this game
Hehe 🐺
Did I just see hades or am I high
Are u coming with us?  It seems mean something big
Can someone help me with a proplem
The young girl at the end of the trailer has to be Zandaya 😜
Greek mythology meets Norse mythology
its great! but it will be on ps4?
BEST GAME EVER
I hope they release this on pc as well as i just finished gow 2018 and i was so amazed by the game.I really want them to release this on pc since i dont have a playstation console :(
Tf happened to broks voice 💀
when release????????????????????????????
who’s the polar express chick at the end
i loved playing gow 4 it was a masterpiece and i will gladly wait for this one
I do not believe
This game better have epic boss fights
Now this is not a game anymore It's an Emotion🥲📈
“Stop thinking like a father and like a general!” We all know what happened last time he did that
Change Boys voice back.
I'll have to wait a few years for it on steam but after just 100% it happy too wait
so, will they sacrifice mimir to revive Tyr?
Why no come out?
my goodnesss, better than mcu & dc combined
Who’s excited for the soundtrack?!
Y'all I'm so gonna get this
0:42 faathur! when can I leave and be on my own?
Look more like a dlc
"In the moment of crisis, panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you" That is really something.
Please
Okay.. So when will Kratos be Crosover with Japanes or Indian Gods? cant wait to see
On ps4?
Give me this game now!
GIVE US SWORD OF OLYMPUS OTHERWISE I'M JUMPING OUT OF A WINDOW
Is that centaur????
There's isn't much of changes in gameplay and controls which is a thing i absolutely love other companies need to realize that people dont like drastic changes
I swear Freya was cursed to not harm any living thing
They need to come-on with some kind of news....
Atreus is a big boi now ...
Will it be available for PS4...
I can’t believe how much of a height difference Tyr has over Kratos being 6ft 6in.
Please change the camera settings pleasee
Looks like dlc
I didn't know whitetails existed in old Scandinavia
This is going to be legendary!
How much more longer do we have to wait for this game to release? I can kick the bucket tomorrow for all I know. Stop playing with us Santa Monica and just release the game already because we are getting tired of waiting. For real.
Okay the way how tyr just stands up gives me goosebumps kratos is already tall but tyr seems to be taller
Hopefully there wont be puzzles every Five minutes like the last game.
The only thing i didnt enjoy in Gow is the fact we didnt have a bunch of weapons like in all the previous gow. only a axe and blades. I usto love finding new weapons and upgrading them
Dude this looks sick
😭😭😭
I'm so excited
"My time has come" -PS4 Pro Fan
I know tyr is for sure going to be the one killing Kratos.
Same graphics of 4
Why is the leviathans axe and the blade of chaos downgraded from last time
Please release on ps4
Can play on ps4 or not?
thor my fav
Zeus! Your Son Has Returned. I Bring The Destruction Of Olympus!”🔥
Don't Be Sorry, Be Better.”
الهجمات التي تم ترقيتها في الجزء السابق موجودة بشكل اساسي في هذا الجزء  لااستطيع الانتظار لرؤية الهجمات الجديدة
Atreus going from cute boy to ugly teen is a universally applicable commentary
That will be atreuse's crush at the end? He has some great taste
I'm so hyped for Tyr... and since Atraeus is Loki... and Loki father Fenrir... and Fenrir bites of Tyr's hand... it's really got me curious and Jor is also Loki's son.
Seeing a little kid grow up just made me want to play this game more
i am so hyped for this game!"!!!!!!!!!
idk but i liked the old boi tbh, this one here is more like a naive teen that screams out loud for justice and thinks himself some kind of a hero because of the prophecies that Kratos hates it more than anything, i loved the little arrogant boi who stabbed Modi, suits the name of “loki” so well .
Can’t even express how excited I am for this game. Can’t wait to visit the other realms and hear mamir’s badass stories lol
Angraboda lied to us at the end😭 Its been 9 months.....
after watching this more than 15 times. it still hypes me when i watch it
Pure
I recently started playing GOW and it's amazing. Crazy seeing how Kratos went from an angry guy to a calm collected Father. Can't wait to finish GOW so I can start this new one!😁
this game is going to be awesome I can already see it ready to play
It's On
*Everybody gangsta til' Kratos start's to think like a general*
Not on ps4 😖??
The guy who had the idea for thor to say these words to kratos, i wish him the best, i cant wait to see kratos reaction to this
This looks 100x better than the entire Xbox/Bethesda 2022 showcase
The dude that appears with the rainbow is probably an Asgardian soldier, right?
Angrboda? Isn't she the GF of Loki?
I hope that this would also come out for pc
Me: ooouuu Atreus grown handsomely and yeay Mimir is in the game… Kratos: Head.. Me: yeay head is in the game too!
If Fenrir and Tyr are fighting side by side, it will be glorious
I don't want to wait until November to play this game. I hope they release it a little sooner.
pc please?
Kratos: Boy!!! Atreus: yes sir!! Mimir: you two doesn’t stop breaking things ?
I would love to play this on my PC :(
I think I’ll miss Atreus’s wonder when exploring the world, like he was a little boy amazed by everything (ex the turtle house Freya lives in). I doubt he’ll have that same sense of wonder as a teenager. Other than that, you can tell this game will be absolutely amazing and definitely GOTY
The last one was beatiful. But pretty dull and boring to play in the end.
Okay head me out… Making the game multiplayer co-op where someone can play as Kratos and the other is Atreus! 🤔🤔
Looks incredible. I cant freaking wait.
November 2022 if you’re wondering
If you dont get to play with things like the blades of Olympus then I'll be a tiny bit disappointed
this boy is so dumb i hope they remove from the game
Such a garbage game. No hype for me. Sorry.
CANT WAIT TO GET MY BOYFRIEND THIS GAME<3
😡😡😡soonnnnnn??????
No ones upset that this is just GoW 2018 with a winter skin? Literally the same hub area, just no boat, but we get our very own balto team to take us from A to B lol. Same terrible 3rd person over the shoulder camera angle that’s awkward for this type of gameplay. Some new skills added to the combat, that’s sick, but not anything to gawk over. I got a feeling there won’t be any action commands so you really fell like you’re just watching a movie instead of playing an action game. Cory Barlow got great reception from tomb raider 2013 when he was the cinematics director for that title and just used same formula for GoW and it’s sad. I played GoW 2018 from start to finish found it wasn’t as impactful as the pervious titles. Santa Monica dropped the ball in 2018 and I don’t see them picking it up for this release.
Kratos vs thor
WE neem more games like that but with sorcerer  \ mage
It's a DLC and people are literally blinded by this game 😭
This game will come out in 2026.
It will take a lifetime for this game to come out.
This DLC looks sick. /s
Kratos faces his toughest challenge... Announcing a release date. 🤷🤷
😢😢😢😢😢
This trailer alone shows a ridiculous amount of stuff that needs to be fleshed out in game. This is gonna be huge.
Oooooo teen movie multiracial rommaaaaanceee
Cant wait for Kratos to reach Christianity
nine month no game com on pelestation
It come on ps4
Probably preventing Ragnarok by killing Surtur, .....anddd Kratos replaces him~ ensuring the completion of Ragnarok in the end, slaying all the Asgardians xD
Who do the help out of the cell. The person they ask to come with them
kratos the realm destroyers 🔥
Man I already knew this game would be badass but sheesh, I’m even more excited now. Looks like BOY is going to fall in love in this one as well 😂
why is there an APE in this game?
Ryan Hurst "Opie" as Thor is going to be so awesome
Does Kratos’s face looks like a calm person?
PS4?
Please, someone give Mimir a body!!!
This will be delayed to 2023 I'm calling it now.
We all want SMS to hurry it up in releasing this game but you can’t rush perfection
3:06 atrues : father i can explain
😍😍😍
And again we all in here looking stupid per usual. No news for this game again. 🤷
Can wait for this to come out glad they are making it for ps4 too. And this game Doesn’t have any woke bs in it awesome
And also for ps4?
I cant wait to watch gameplay
Will this game be available on ps4 ???
no date :(
Xd
Still bruh
watching this after summer game fest 2022😑😑😑
J’ai les larmes 😭 😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
9 months with no updates...this is stupid at this point.
Atreus was always a b*****
It seems that my every complain about previous game will not be fixed here.
This is stupid that we have to wait this long for a real update on this game.
Ojalá llegue para ps4🥺🥺
This looks like a DLC…
I need it I need it I need it in my SpongeBob voice
My favorite game 🤯🔥🤤💙😍 yes
When the game will release?
Who the f is the giant at the end?
Cmon an announcement already 😤
2023 ?  Really ???
Ps4 please
Ight i may just prime a PS5 and return after playing this 😂
Almost 9 months with no updates
I wish they didn't tease Tir so hard then just show us in the trailer.
PTSD flashed back at Kratos when Boy said “Start thinking like a General”
Facts:- *The word general reminded Kratos of real bad memories and seeing his son thinking that way made him angry and worried about him*
Will their be like weapons added like the blade of Olympus type bcz it was way too op I think and would be necessary for character development
2:51 "And my axe"
I like mimir as he the only one who doesn't feel the great winter in the eternty
come ooooon give us something else
One of the best games ever. And skyrim 5 and resident evil 7 and village.those are my favourites 🥰🥰
who was that he asked are you coming in the end
Stop playing Santa Monica and give us something.
Another day with no trailer or release date for the game. This is just insane at this point.
0:10 possible main menu and when you choose difficulties and start Kratos starts moving and Atreus comes in
Finally kratos  has a small  family  and peace  not nightmares and anger
Atreu’s grown so much. I’ll miss his “Nista!”
Anyone know exactly when it releases yet
You can tell Atreus has grown from his voice.
All play station love this game because 14m view's and 14 subscribers
Kratos: *incoherent anger*  Mimir: *casually drawing*  Atreus: *still whining*  Mimir is the only one who developed as a person between games, and took on a hobby.
Picking this up on PS4 day one. Can't wait
Almost 9 months with no updates
GOW never fails to disappoint us 🙃🙃
I hope this comes to pc too
Wow I can't believe that there still no trailer or release date for this game yet. Im going to have a gray beard soon by the time we get something.
Ты что делаешь сейчас
Will it release for ps4
Not gonna play this woke garbage.
بزاف على هادا انطلاق هاد اصدار
"i just want answers" _ :O Shook.
No one's gonna talk about Atreus riding a deer? 😂Maybe he'll summon a tiger in the game too.
3:04 Is this Atreus' possible love interest
I don't see Thor as that big of a threat. Kratos literally beat Chronos and Zues. Who were the pinnacle top tier.   I will play it just to finish the saga.
Kratos is dialed down like a kept dog. He needs that relentlessness of past games. I understand the woke crowd hates his "toxic masculinity"  But it isn't as fun to play when you have a skinny soyboy son running around. ...  The older games always top tier.
I swear this game is taking forever to come out. What is the hold up? You guys need to hurry it up.
Please, create a Ukrainian localization.  Ukraine is not Russia. 🇺🇦🙏
This trailer is a masterpiece. No other way to put it.
Imagine how sick some boss fights could be I the norse world, could fight sutr or fenrir
BIG BOY!
Please give us a new trailer Santa Monica.
How much longer for a release date?
Graphics is at the same level as previous part. It needs new engine.
I keep coming back here, gave us something Santa Monica Studio
20-30% Progress Boss: Freya. 30-60% Progress Boss: Thor. 100% Progress Final Boss: Odin.
Fanboys in here mad bc ragnarok wasnt shown at todays showcase. Yet leading to this event, sonys website specifically says "only focussing on indy & VR2" man some people are just slow
Im at the amoco not chevron
welp just came after that state of play disaster with no ragnarok news...
How much long longer 🤑🤑🤑
Was he baldur at last scene
I Hope that ps4 version doesnt get cancelled or something
Tyr: "I thought youd be bigger"
No sound???? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Is available in xbox series
Is it just me, or does this trailer look and sound ten times dumber than the last game? There's no subtlety or originality in the dialogue at all, and the scenes shown spoil way, WAY too much. "I should be out there finding out who I am, who Loki is!" sounds like something a twelve-yearold fanfiction author, or Disney writer, might put down. After waiting for years, my excitement about Ragnarok fell off a cliff when I watched this.
I waitttttttttttttt
Honestly am i the only one think of the map on this game, I'm very curious where they would choose or where they would chose for us to go hunting and looting on a new map
LOL. Cringeworthy
They had to put there a black girl otherwise all the woke dummies would cry about racism 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When????
The girl at the ending face looks so familiar
When Tyr stands up and the music plays.  Goosebumps activate. 🔥
Finally Thor comes in
Why is the son of the man with a gruff voice an American voice..the American voice is lovely but I would have liked an icelandic voice 😉
Release date:09/30/2022?
Ngl, I'm kinda hoping that Kratos has to go back to Greece at some point in the game
" you seem like a calm and reasonable person"  *Kratos a 7 foot very muscular man covered in ashes* "(Confused) I do?"
The same vibe Hercules vs kratos
I'm curious to see whether or not the player will still get to control atreus, we got to because he was still learning and that was similar to training in game as it could get, however he showed great independence in the baldur fight, and given that some time has clearly passed he would undoubtedly be more proficient with his bow
its 2021  why not come???
3:03 the girl that atreus will marry😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏 *(not even joking)
Would be so much better if body parts fell apart
Hats off to Sony for NOT forcing a Trilogy, because they did not want to drag this game on. This new GOW series was originally a trilogy, they cancelled an entire game just to pack this one with content and conclude the Norse Chapter. Ubisoft would do the OPPOSITE of this.
if I can't jump in this game I'm returning it .....
I just hope *atreus* doesn't *BeTrayUs* 😎
Guys i think atreus is gonna kill kratos
When will it come 😔😔 keen to play gow Ragnarok
*I hope we get another Trailer or State of Play..*
I can’t wait to play this 😁
Will it come to ps4?
Was that girl at the end Angrboda, Loki’s future partner?
Thor : You seem like a calm amd reasonable person!  Kratos : L3 + R3
OP thank you PlayStation
Lamaaaaa, kapan release nya ????????
Kratos looks more batter without mustache
I hope that they will find a way to access all the realms
Thor: You Seem Like A Calm And Reasonable Person... Are You A Calm And Reasonable Person?     Meanwhile Kratos: 1:57
ODEN THY DAYS ART NUMBERED!!!!
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😂😂😂🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼
1:58 best sound
How can this studio create such an epic game so fast is beyond my understanding
0:48  Also Kratos in the past games: Zeus! Your son has returned. I am bringing the destruction of Olympus!
2:48
Character that developed for decades ......without any flaws ....kratos 💥
Let's see how the game hold up after its release. Gonna wait and see.
i love how the game looks exactly the same but we will probably need next gen graphics love it
Im happy they didnt pull some TLOU bs and make us play as Atreus then kill Kratos 😂
Ngl they need to release this today I can’t even breathe
But...      WHERE'S THE SERPENT???
How long will it take for us to get a new trailer? Im tired of waiting.
Please reduce d puzzles in this one 😂
2:48 who was that big guy?
that will be a best game game in the history
I feel like Atreus is grown a little bit because of his voice
Somehow 4 years later FREYA IS STILL CRYING
Nice box tick at the end
Who’s he gonna fight next? The ancient Egyptians or Aliens?
For some reason it looks different it looks alittle cartoonist idk why but it seems not as gritty I hope  wrong
Release date???
What if its a two part fight with thor and the second fight he have his axe then the real fight happen
ok tyr is slightly intimidating lol
This is gonna be amazing it better be worth this waiting and hype
Best franchise of all time
pls i cant wait this game
Bellissimo
that tune after tyr stands up just hypes me for the game
They need to make a movie out of Kratos and have Jason Momoa play the part!!
Please blade of Olympus also come in gow Ragnarok like blade of chaos
Another game of the year which is untouchable.  Letssss goooooo
wait is loki freya's father cause i never seen freya shapeshift or i just forgot
I wonder if there is any possibility that Atreus will be a Loki variant in Loki season 2?
They should of rever reviled this much 😩
Was the girl at the end the same girl from polar express?
Too many people of color in this game, and I'm not talking about Brok.
11.11.22
Imagine how cool it would be if kratos lost control and starts killing everyone in his path again
Atreus  finally caught that deer😂😂
Another great GOW masterpiece coming soon! 👍🙏😁🤜❤️
Where do u realeas this game
Imagine something happens to Atreus, Rage of Sparta starts playing and Kratos begins to think like a general.
Did you guys not see the elves fighting with blades this time?
Im gonna have a heart attack, im so hyped, i just cant wait to play it 🤯
Honestly doesn't look any better than the last game 🙄 still hyped tho
Does anyone know how much it will be
"Play has no limits"... Lol, i think it's time to delete this phrase))) Russian and Kazakhstan and some others countries try playing with extra limits)
What about us on ps4?
missing old kratos very much
BOY!!!!!
Gonna buy the PS5 to only play this game :-)
"War is  not the only way" *proceed to beat everyone* War is not the only way but it is the shortest solution - kratos
Waiting for the Game Release.... Love To Play this game.
2:22 the most rawest moment
You seem live a calm and reasonable person, he truly does not know Kratos. Lol
Kratos: no
Seen in Japan.
There was more than one of that person. The Hollowfied are true also, and people similar to Eren Yeager.
It has a Soul fragment yes, but it is confusing.
Another emptyshell yes. Powerfull though not sure what to do the Homunculi is trying to ascend to Olympia and claim Victory. It cannot Ascend.
Kylo Ren is a Homunculi as in Leomord.
Or not.
I'AM in my home on DAMASCUS.
Thor: Are u a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Ask your Greek counterpart.
I want gameplay just like it is in the trailer. I want my screen shaking when I hit my enemy with a heavy attack
Cant wait to play it on pc , and we're getting the uncharted collection next month on PC tooo
Santa Monica please release this ragnarok...can't wait until now
So close but yet so far
if you look closely, the shield's shape changes throughout the video.   2:27 2:32 2:34  It seems like we can change the shield's styles.
It safe to say ragnarock is coming.
Mimir is the family pet now.
i wanna see Kratos drinking more wine and after he goes “ehhhhghhgghh”
This put a tyr in my eye
Czy to też będzie na ps4?
Atreus is loki, right?
PC ???
I miss the third person perspective
Alexa should’ve replaced with a Mimir. Every household needs one.
*funny how pc players are more hyped than PlayStation fans..*
Best part of traler 2:13 to 2:40
So, Who Is Kratos' Son?
😬😬😬😬😍😍😍😍😍😍
Why only ps5 😭😭😭😭😭
I am getting very impatient to play Ragnarok. I know that the team is hard at work but I really want to play this game the second that it releases. So bad that it's driving me absolutely insane. This game is the only thing I even think about.
Wow a black woman
Best game of the year comming soon☺
Gen z artreus
And still no release date
I like how Atreus comes into frame with a deer which makes him look like he has horns like Loki
2:09   I would love to see Kratos  vs  thor
I want tons of boss fights
imagine a GOW game on Unreal Engine 5
War is not the only way. Wonder what changed him
How come i didnt see this trailer looks epic
Atreus had a kind of mother figure in Freya and it was wonderful. But by killing her son, Kratos threw away such a beautful bond and valuable ally. Kratos hurt both Freya and his own son considering the friend he took from Atreus.if I have to see our ally and Atreus' mother figure as a villian in this game because of that, I won't play it.
I wonder if we will get another moment when Atreus summons his father's power like in the last game.  "STOP IT!!!! URRG AAARRRRGGGGG"
I think the game will release somewhere near 2024. But i really hope that it's coming this or next year>3
thor: "you seem like a calm and reasonable person" me: *takes off glasses and hand them to thor* " you seem to need that more then me...."
2 yr old kiddo doesn't know how terrible a war is becuase we all know kratos past murders coolness and murders
Every western game have this harsh- voiced grunt as the main character. Just looking at this or Witcher 3 for example. You can see the game was developed by a bunch of men with power fantasies. I find games like this embarrassing.
This game is going to be on a whole different Tyr
He better back tf up walking up on kratos like that
Can't wait to watch Jacksepticeye play it 😂
I have  nothing else to be excited in life except for Ragnarok. I just want to play this game and waiting is driving me crazy. Please hurry and give us a trailer or something.
Yo it’s that dude from fortnite!!
Ahh shoot! 😁 can't wait!
Thor is in here
in a gaming world  filled with filth and scammers santa monica a lighthouse of hope
Kratos can totally take Thor. Dude took out a whole pantheon lol
but it honestly still feels like the same game though... the mechanics, fight style all look the same
Who r all coming daily/weekly & watching this beast Trailer 😈❤️🍀 Edit - i think for Christmas/new year this game will release to ps5 🤘😇🐉
This game is finna be so amazing
Stop thinking like a Father! And start thinking like a General! Wow!
That opening shot is for sure the starting menu
Can't wait to be chomped on by alligators 9000 times
Let’s go!!!!
I'm so hyped for this game definitely getting it
" BOI " the atreus META
Blade of chaos is here
“ZEEEUUSSSSSSSS”  - Kratos the calm and reasonable person .
How much more do we have to wait for Ragnarok? I know it have to be soon. I can feel it in my scrot.
Ps5 only 😢?
Awesome😎
Kratos is a beast
The score when the title is introduces gives Goosebumps *literally*
"Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general" *Vengeful Spartan kicks in* Odin: Oh oooo.....
Hol up, atreus still has the same haircut and clothes 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Lol
Thor : Are you calm and reasonable person? Kratos : wouldn't you like to know  weather boy
It would be cool is if in the future when Atreus is all grown up the game could be multiplayer and someone could play as Kratos and the other Atreus. It could be their second attempt at multiplayer.
BRO I’M WAITINGGGGGGGGG
Game's looking spicy af. I'm probably going to wait until its on PC though rather than play it on launch on the console
boi !
Ps4 ?
Wheres my boy kratos ? It's been 8 months
tyr is very tall........
I just wanna see kratos getting The blade of olympus
I am desperately in want of a trailer and a release date for this game! When this game drop it's going to be superb in every way imaginable!
I feel bad for Thor and the rest of the Aesir… Because Kratos is comin for dat a**
I feel bad for Thor and the rest of the Aesir… Kratos is comin for dat @$$
When the Playstation Company contracted the developer. this is what happened. What!!? The truth is a developer programmer whether it's an application or a game can eat a big company alive. even for only $5
Ragnarok, starfield, botw2. They all get delayed "these days" bc fans are so traumatized by CDPJR'S cyberpunk. Those guys released that broken game on purpose. Why? Bc now ALL FANS ARE LITERALLY begging for delays. All while saying "wE d0nT wAnT aNotHeR cYbErPunK" 🤦🤦

Few more months... 😉👍
Aterus has such a weird voice😂😂
Is it coming on pc ?
How much more longer Santa Monica for a update? Im getting sick of waiting.
this game absolutely masterpiece of all time
Aetreus is loki... in the norse lore loki destroyed asgard together with jormungander and fenris = aetreus is the new kratos soon?
Spamming O is gonna be fun
Only in ps5 ?
Yes
I think kratos might give up his life for his idiot son. It happens all the time. The father grows and heals from his past and teaches their children the right way. However their children are idiots and do impulsive reckless things. Leading to them being in danger and the father giving up his life for his child

Release this game already.
Can’t waittttt
I Like How This Is The Same Guy Who R**ed Alot other women throughout his past
the boi grew up
It’d be cool if we got to see various Gods of War. Tūmatauenga, Uitzilopochtli, Hachiman etc.
Come on Santa Monica I'm already watche this video a thousand of times show us the next update, please
Kratos Vs Odin And Thor🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Come on Santa Monica studios just give us a update or something on this game already. This game is going to be game of the century! No doubt about it.
No se olviden de silent hill y shadoe of the colossus
Killer game
2 Kratos is alive
Atreus: "stop thinking like a father and think like a general" kratos knowing what's gonna happens if he dors
"War is not the only way."  True.  But economic sanctions can only take you so far.
It seems like they reused a lot of assets but I don’t really care. This games looks amazing
The gamer 2323 is here in the chat
The axe feels like it has such weight to it in this trailer
this is going to be a top tyr game
8 MONTHs no release date... well I think its gonna be release in 2023 :(
Kratos has one of the best character developments among the game characters. And glad to see Mimir in the game again. The tales he told on the boat are really interesting.
🔥🔥🔥
I dunno , I think this game is just going to be more of the same , it gets boring really fast really hate that axe and the powers aren't epic enough
When it release?
Cannot wait!
Duuuuuudeee!!!!!
1:46 is this available in current game, 2018 one?
❤Wow
It's been 4 years how long we have to wait
start thinking like a general? boy you have no idea what your father has been through...
Atreus must have special powers or a lot of strength he was carrying a buck on his back
Atreus: Why are you ashy in colour father? Kratos: Because I thought like a general and not like a father
The best game of 2022 since 2021
Is he baldure in last?
POGGERS
Of course they add some random, out of place black girl at the end.
that chime when the giant stood up. chills.
Soon kratos become dc universe
If Thor turns out to be as tall as Tyr he gon be absolutely monstrous.
I'm hyped!
6th time watching and I just realized Atreus is just casually strolling in with a deer all by himself😢
Kratos is both a father and a destruction entity
Notice: Tyr has only one arm in chains.  My guess is that the chain binding him is the unbreakable chain forged by Brok & Sindri, and that getting Tyr out requires removing his hand, thus bringing it bCk to mythology where Tyr lost his hand to bind the wolf Fenrir
I love this game, I love this franchise.  Man what a time to be alive
But is there a jump button?
1:23 BRO THAT ISLAND IS SO BIG! IF WE COULD PLAY IT I'LL BE SO HAPPY !
You will get your delay soon enough. Well, the whole game of it :) nod nod
Mari??? 3:07
So exited
will it be able on PS4 not just PS5  I LOVE IT CAN'T WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTT🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thor: "You seem like a calm and rational person." - Famous last words.
I’m patiently waiting and at least we know it’ll come out this year, it’s impressive how fast time goes by
New game new combos,you already know
When is this game supposed to come out?
It is no longer Dad of Boy    It is Dad of Teen and/or Dad of Angst
Pleaseeee release the gaaaameeeee
Let the battle begin.
Make a 3rd game
In the mean time I’m gonna play some Skyrim
They should have stuck to Greek mythology
i think the theme of this game is fatherhood   i know no one asked but thats just what im saying
No doubt it'll be another cross gen game held back on PS5, by also being released on PS4.  Sony lied.
My boy going to put the hands 🙌 Thor
He a man
The end of the trailer is SOOOOOO Jotunheim full of life and giants. Kratos and Atreus are wondering how that's possible and Angrboda then says that quote from the trailer.
Im so hyped man
Just finished GoW 1 on PC....please please please bring this over as well
ok i actually really don't like the trailer, it just looks like a dlc for the last game, there seems to be nothing new or inventive, same old same old, especially how the hype gameplay segments look like they're straight up from the last game
8 months with no updates 😪
If they end up adding extra weapons like they did in the past, this will be joy, and seeing kraits use his shield in guessing they’ll add runes on it?
NEED a release date
I'm so sad that I have an Xbox right now
I like 95% of this trailer. But it's just that itty-bitty 5% at the end that turns my stomach.     And bare in mind, I am a black person. Not half black. Nor quarter black.
Santa Monica please give us some kind of news on this game. We all want a release date.
I hope Kratos isn't racist. Looks like his son has a fling.
I hope Kratos isn't racist. Looks like his son has a fling.
Kratos is the most dangerous warrior in the galaxy
This game will be game of the year award again
Wooow it’s the same game 🙃
This comment is for everyone who says "tAkE y0uR tiMe We d0nT wAnT aN0tHeR cYbErPuNk" *Since when has santa monica EVER gave us a broken game WHEN?* So with that being said... Your part of the reason why santa monica hasnt shown anything. Bc of fans like u who keep saying "tAkE y0uR tiMe" its been 4 fkn years man. We are ready for the game.😠 If this were ANY OTHER studio, u people would be harnessing them for information. My goodness man, show us something!
Grabs possibly jumping and jump attacks are getting added then
I will definitely buy PS5 just for this game!
Almost 8 months with no updates
cant wait for this exclusive to come to PC! Thanks sony
Who's still watching this at middle of 2022 We need a gameplay 😢
Tyr show up how big he are Kratos : well reminds me of the 12 task guy i beat up
Is this dlc or a new game
Wow bro I have been waiting 8 months now and nothing new or even a teaser for the release date I'm starting to loose hope and forget about this game smh😓🤬
Atreus should be taller
Hearing mimir put a smile in my face
Almost 8 months... I know that Santa Monica should take all the time to give us the best experience BUT I CANT WAIT ANYMORE! SHOW US SOMETHING 😭❤. ATLEAST GIVE US THE RELEASE DATE!
So the girl at the end is angrboda, the wifey of loki, if y'all are confused how do i know, read the cc at the end
Will this game be for ps4 also ?!
MID
0:11 when you look close enough Kratos looks right into your Soul
They need to make a movie or som it would be a banger
Boi is 70% head now XD
This looks great
The theme pummm pummmm pumm .. is heavily inspired pirates of the carribean  the curse of the black pearl ....
BROOOOOOOO GKINGGGG GOOOSEBUMPSSAS OMFGGGG
Can't wait for it
Trash
"Are you coming with us?" "No" Credit scrolls
The best part is MIMIR CAN TURN A PAGE IN A BOOK USING A FLIPPING SPOON!!
feels like a DLC
This brings a TYR to my eye...
Atreus will be the one to kill Thor!
Like if you’re frightened by the possibility of a delay to 2023
Kratos: stay close to me boi Little boi: aight sir Teen boi: yolooooooooo
Já fazem 7 meses e mais nada do jogo é apresentado. Tá com muita cara que vai ficar pra 2023 esse jogo. Ele não vai competir em um GOTY com o o Horizon.
Veeryyy veeeryyy niceeeeee!!!!!!!!
Game of the year.
We ready 😍
Another game of the year :
That place at the starting looks like the black breath location
When Ragnarok?
How tall do you think Thor will be? We know that Magni and Tyr is tall from looking at them. Do you think Thor will be just as tall?
They are taking forever to give us a new trailer or a update.
I like the way the combat of the blades of chaos looks, it has that touch of flashy moves, they move fast and hit strong, just how they used to feel on the old games, cant way to play this bad boy
Fighting mechanics feeling of when yoy hit the enemies in this game is so well made and the sequel seems better it will be completely insane, well I hope so but according to this video it looks better. Ut ayrelt be even better on the release. This is just alpha
waiting to buy ps5 for this game
Can’t wait cuz
Delayed Again
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Sees ⭕ over Thor's head
😍
I’m waiting for this game like a calm and reasonable person
2:54 Short Tyler1 meme
Im disappointed. David Jaffe  said that this game may not come out in 2022 after all. This is heartbreaking if true.
Man I can not wait for this 👌
That 's so wonderful . I dont know how to talk about this game - its too amazing !!
with that beard i feel he should be chubby he has been a dad a while now
Ya think he will have a spear or a sword in the Egyptian pantheon?
Since Atreus asks Kratos to think like a general, must mean Kratos told him much more about his past. Otherwise, why would Atreus say that?
And ofcourse you can't have norse mythology without a black girl in it 🙄
ffs why is this age restricted
when will you come
So Freya can draw her sword now???
i love this line 1:03
One guess is, we will be playing. As Atreus one time
Tyr standing up to kratos:   Kratos: ive seen bigger
What is taking so long for this game to come out?
Can someone explain what is the connection between these mcu stuff like thor, odin, mjolnir and asgard. How are those stuff related to this game? ?.
I really hope this game comes out soon. You just don't know how excited I am to play this game.
What are some of your theories that you think will happen in Ragnarok?
Ps4 ?
I still don't understand how kratos went from Greek mythology to old norse
Shame I won't be able to get my hands on a ps5 to play this :(
As much as I like this new Kratos,  I miss the old one.  Seems unlikely,  but I hope they remaster 1 and 2 some day 🤞
hytale
Hearing atreus' voice got deeper feels surreal
Been waiting on Ragnarok so I can play GOW 18 again. Going to be glorious 😎😎😎😎
I really want to play this game. This wait is driving me insane.
Please give next trailer
Brok and Sindri are together!
Santa Monica Studio, please take my money..
I hope Fenrir becomes an ally! If you read about him, Fen was betrayed by Tyr and some of the other gods from Norse. Sounds a lot like Kratos only the latter was betrayed by Greek gods.
Another GOTY from this very talented studio
Buna! părerea mea este că jocul este foarte slab și ușor de jucat, povestea ii bunicica și grafică ii destul de bună, dar gameplay'ul este foarte slab! cu foarte puține mișcări create de tine, practic la jocul asta trebuie sa apeși butoanele care ți le ordonă jocul că sa ai succes de a învinge, mi se pare plictisitor și robotic, așteptând ca cineva să îți dea ordine că tu să faci ceva! ar fi fost mai frumos sa creezi tu combourile, să te ferești de inamici sau sa ii iei prin surprindere cu diferite abilități sau lovituri.! Repet, este doar părerea mea. până la urmă nu la toți ne place același timp de joc! baftă.
Hope they release the game for pc sooner
Cant wait!!! Thank you for what you are doing for us🙏
if there are still only 3 exclusives for ps5 by the time GOW comes out.  im getting it on ps4.
😱😱🔥🔥أله الحرب قادمة 😮
Please give us a update or something on this game. I want Ragnarok!
Come on and release this game already.
It is only on ps5?
I hope this game goes all put with the bosses this time around. I want to fight Thor, Odin, giants, dragons and surtur. GoW 2018 was awesome but it doesn't have these gigantic bosses old games had mainly because of budget. I loved the fight against the dragon and hope more fights like this will be in the game. Overall GOW ragnarok looks like GOW 2018 but better, smoother and with a more complex combat and bigger enemy variety. Exactly what I was hoping for in the sequel and I'm hyped
Still waiting on the game Santa Monica
Idk why but it give me doom eternal vibe
Elden Ring has been so incredible and surpassed so, so many expectations that everyone's saying it'll take GOTY. I'm all for that and it is indeed highly possible. But this, this will be the other main competition for that title. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this game will be straight up amazing. Literally unshakable resolve in my belief that it'll be one of the best games of the last decade, easily. Cannot wait.
Insert diversity hire at end, please insert girder.
Atreus looks like tintin
so...who's the diversity hire at the end there?
I NEVER KNEW THAT MY FAVOURITE GAME IS GETTING A SEQUEL I AM SOOO HAPPY AND EXCITED  happy face :)
kratos : 2:48 R U coming with us  me      : yes of cours how much it cost  playsyation 5
angbroda is still a cringe :)
Like seriously how much longer do we have to wait for this game to be released? The wait is killing me.
If you guys didn’t realize the dogs kratos uses is white and black meaning 1 of them is sun and the other one is the moon and those dogs are a big part of ragnarok
Oh my boy has grown up  Cant wait to spam square and more
Soo it's not an expansion but a standalone?
i just finished the game yesterday! i fell inlove! only minimal improvements tht i can suggest but over all is perfect! i also hope they can release this in pc game🙁 im too poor to buy ps5🥺 anw so cool game! love it!
I am so ready for this man!!!! Playing the 2018 one right now for the 10 time such a 🤬masterpiece!!!
how long time need wait😭😭😭
Oh man please hurry up and release this game!! I can't wait much longer. This is the hypest I ever been for a video game!!!
I want a fight with Thor and Odin.
I hope they let you use your weapons in rage mode this time so he can fight like OG Kratos. That would be 🔥🔥🔥
>the Blades are enhanced to use as grappling hooks Yup, I'm sold, this is going to be at least 8/10.
hope there's ps4 version
Wir warten
I jizzed so hard at this beautiful trailer
will it be on pic
RAGNOROK
I need to play this game already man!! This game is going to be the game of the century and I can't wait much longer. Just hurry and release it!
This trailer gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it man
I have a bad feeling for this... hope i am wrong
Imagine kratos gives THE TALK to his boyyy
I dont like these GOW r , camera view isnt nice
1:54 .
To all the pc users who will be getting a ps5 just because of Ragnarok raise your hands. ✋️
Wow this game gonna be aswome
Still coming back to rewatch. I've been having dreams recently where Atreus uses the chaos blades. I cannot wait for this game!! But at the same time, please take as much time as you need. You can't rush perfection.
Yeah...after kratos We Want Child Of War
Kratos challenge in past raising a boy diffuculty for him:pain Kratos challenge raising a teenage boy diffuculty:???
This game can't come out fast enough. I want to play this game already.
This still seems like a pipe dream in the best way possible, probably going to get a ps5 just for this I'm pretty sure a kidney will cover it
Honestly, I really hope they take their time with this game. People will get upset about it being several delays but those are not the true fans. Take as long as you need team Santa Monica, perfection takes time. ♥️
Would be dope if they let you bring your XP over from the last game
I've never been so excited in my life for a game to release
are you a calm and reasonable person me remembering what kratos did to the greek pantheon in gow3 yep he seems like a calm and reasonable person
Imagine they bring back hercules gauntlets or hades hooks could be mint
War vs Thunder.. I can't wait..
you seem like a calm and reasonable person… are you a calm and reasonable person
1:54 NO!
I AM TOTALLY FREAKED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where are you, Algerians? 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🧡🎮🔥
ويل من شر قد اقترب 🔥🎮
Come on! Im still waiting for this game to come out. How long do I have to wait?
Please release on pc please release on pc please please please
That’s gonna be amazing
Only for Playstation 😭. Why?
What i would do to play this game rn
Seems like a calm and responsible person
Please hurry up and release this game. I can't wait much longer.
Yo PlayStation who was the one with the sword attack and kratos on the thing
Is this game will be available for ps4....?can any tell me...please....!
I AM SO HYPE
2:45 Ah so Tyr is still alive
Who’s that tall guy tier???
Neebs gaming better play this
Imagine if u could fight as Tyr
remember when they said it will come out 2021? pepperidge farm remembers.  come on give us at least SOMETHING cory
Let's hope GOW III or a new Santa Monica IP will be as ambitious and plays like Elden Ring
Every time I watch this video I want to press the like button. But it's already done. Why can't I like this video everytime I watch it?
Ragnarok will release in 2025 bc u ponies keep saying:"tAkE aLL tHe tiMe y0u nEeD" and the most annoying one: "wE d0nT wAnT An0TheR cYbeRpUnK" this is why they keep *TROLLING* all of you with a non release date. I mean come on man, the developers are letting their kids play it before u fanboys. Yet sony can still do no wrong in your eyes😂🤣 wow. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really hope the game will let us wear that fur coat to the main outfit too, I know the games gonna be amazing but idk why that's all I'm caring about 😭😂😂
ah yes now we can really see kratos vs freya
Dude... Did Kratos dyed his beard?, cause looks darker
I am expecting a masterpiece after completing elden ring and forbidden west
back here for the 47th time
It's sad I only have PS4
The only game series that still will pump out W games. Thank you for giving me hope once again for video games
I'm glad to see Mimir back in the game. I hope he'll have more stories to tell during traversal like in the previous game.
is that girl Hela????
Cant wait to see what the end of the world looks like in this game!
No matter how hard kratos try he never goner find a peace for long isn't he
come on at least take the camera further from him its not a third person shooter
ถ้าเกมออกวางตำหน่ายแล้วจะมีแต่ps5เท่านั้นหรอที่ได้เล่น
He is still soft! And now the kid is shouting at him FFS.
That kid should shuttt uppp!
This is the reason its coming in 2025.  Bc of the "wE wiLL wAiT" comments. Im tired of waiting and im done with expecting a 2022 release. Im just waiting on forespoken at this point. 🤷
How did I not find out about this until now?
Funny amount of xbots calling this DLC just by looking at the single weapon when it's written it's a sequel in description... Guess what for them forza 5 turned boring in 2 days and already failed halo infinite got on their nerves that they became super excited about a ps5 exclusive 😂 .. Better luck next time xbots
Atreus sounds like Malcom from Malcom in the Middle 😂
Can't wait to be ambushed by Freya all over the 9 realms.
когда тира увидел ахуел в тотальности
Thor, by all stretches of the imagination, destroys Kratos. Mere shockwaves of his blows destroy planets and full on strikes can destroy stars. Add to that massively faster than light reactions and travel speed, devastating ranged attacks, and finally the Godblast which hurts beings that destroy universes. This isn’t a fight. This is a competition to see how many milliseconds Kratos survives
I imagine Kratos is just gonna casually wipe out another set of gods.
Calm and Reasonable are two words that Do Not describe Kratos. I think Thor was tryin to make a joke.
please release to PC
This is a trilogy absolutely brilliant
2:12
Its obvious that this game will be released 31/12/2022.
Will it be for ps4 too?
I think it is beyond hilarious that people are saying this is just DLC ahahaha
Ragnarok is Coming 🥶🥶
"Are You A Calm And Reasonable Person?" - Asked Kratos,clamly
We are 7 months from this trailer. Let’s hope something comes soon
Imagine playing xbox
Anyone notice the TWO wolves pulling the sled? Maybe Atreus named them Sköll and Hati?  Kinda hoping the keep to the true end of Ragnarök, where Surtr just annihilates everything, which is basically killing Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, AND Loki. Jörmungandr was born from Loki and Angrboða (the girl at the end of the trailer maybe?) This is gonna be a wild ride.
In ps4
Когда будет новый видео
I can't express my excitement for this game.
Yup I agree jaffe it’s dlc 😂
has anyone noticed the scene with dreki is the only scene in the whole gameplay part of the trailer that atreus is not present hinting that we might get separated from atreus
It would be cool if ghost of his mom /sister/grandpa (Zeus) appear in some moment
❤️
This will be out probably on the 25 I hope
Back here after finishing the game again for the 5th time and I still can't stop getting hyped over this trailer!!! Each day waiting for this game is agony!!!
are you a calm and reasonable person? kratos- proceeds to spam o*
Will it come for pc too?
Loki: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a gentlema…  Kratos: No!   Kratos is the perfect father figure every child needs.
To be honest I think Batista should be kratos
Well got my hardon, I'm ready
the sound effects are fire
😉
Wait...Freya can actually attack Kratos? Didnt Odin make it so she literally couldnt raise a fist at anyone?
Thor (presumably): "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"   Buddy you do not want to pull on thread.
Can't wait to hear more Mimir's Norse jokes
🥱💯
Hand it over
Wait til I see one person 😜 let y'all don't put that ragerox
I can't wait!
Wait it make's sense niw Týr is a giant
Atreus: "Time is running out!" Sony fans waiting for Ragnarök Release Date Reveal: "Indeed!"
Ну когда уже блеать
Stranger: do you know who your son  just fkd with? Odin:.. Stranger: Kratos Wick Odin: oh
What will be cool is if we get to play as Tir at some point.  👍
I wish kratos could borrow thors hammer just for this game it would be awesome
gonna be an expensive dlc
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Boi: tHinK liKE a gEnERaL daDdy  Kratos: k (proceeds to annihilate the universe)
Thor gives me Negan vibes.
Why did they show the last scene with the black girl like it was something I should be shocked about ?
Potential characters:  -Bladur (returns as an ally perhaps)  -that centaur was 100% Skaði but I could be wrong  -Valkyries  -Ivaldi/One of his sons  -Heimdall  -Fenrir
Wheres the release date sony :)
I kind of want a Spotify playlist on Mimir’s tales
I hope it comes out this summer cuz I can't wait anymore
I can not wait any more !!!! I am so 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 for the state of play!!!!! 🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓
Why'd they have to spoil Tyr is alive
It’s still GOW4 but inspired by scorpion!
Can't wait for this game
Krato's voice is Truly GODLEY.
This will be a classic!
100000000
Release please
Is chris judge playing Kratos again?
It’s kind of a shame because I will miss Baldur as a character, he was awesome and very tragic. Thor won’t be tragic at all
Trailer 2 please
The whole eternal times I was waiting for.... Blisss....... And legasy of kratos.  How he converted from a powerful leader to a caring father make my mind blow up and goosebumps all over me.....,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can't wait
0:23 you know they did that on purpose to make it look like Loki's helmet with the horns
1:36 🤣 i love how brok reacts to atreus being a marvelous teenager
Thor in Ragnarok we have a Hulk
Ii it only for ps5
ذحين ابنه كبر
اول عربي🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿
3:04 Funny how this character will be the only reason people get annoyed at the game, “she doesn’t belong in the world” is a common excuse.  Just like how people are used to hemsworth Thor not big Boi mythologically accurate Thor in Ragnarok, this is the studios interpretation. There can be plenty of reasons for why Angrboda is a darker skinned character than woudove been common for the “time period” but if her character is interesting it really doesn’t matter.  And no they are not “making a character black for the sake of it/to appease liberals” that is a shockingly immature way of looking at it and very judgemental when no one has any idea what will be done with the character.
This may be the last time we play as Kratos.
%80 completed man.This will be a big game
Is this like a dlc ??
ANGRBODAAAAAA
Oh Freya... 😢
I'ma find a ps5
i want valk armor
Ⓜ️🗿🌌
💙💙💙
This is like a superior version of the movie "After Earth"
Maybe kratos will help thor
Bro I’m so hyped for this game, also I recently got a ps5 so I’ll be able to get this since it’s a exclusive.
Siuuuuu
I'm back here again everyone T T.
Well, I've really been waiting for this trailer. Judging by what they showed us,the game will be very multifaceted: many worlds, characters, conflicts... but new techniques with leviathan and blades of chaos are also pleasing and surprising. I will say one thing: the game will be cool.
Im gonna be playing this game on PS5 on day one. I cannot wait.
Interesting that the Leviathan Axe and the Blades Of Chaos seem to have returned to their original states, how odd
Just imagine if Atreus has to go through the memories of kratos
Will Loki kill Kratos or there bond to strong for that ??
I'm gonna be old by the time this comes out
Epic😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭!!!!!!!!!!
Lit
Odin All Might.  Give me a date Santa Monica!
goty
Mimir chillin on spectator mode
Atreus shadow in the beginning walking in with the stag looks like Loki's helmet
I wish they added a small glimpse of kratos past before he says no
Those are strong wolf's
I hope they will release it on PC again
Can Atreus' voice be more hollywoodian? At least in GoW4 it had some uniqueness.
I feel like Keaton throws his axe at Thor and Thor catches it saying I really thought this axe was special then he throws meholnir at krakow and then he catches it says same did i
We going to act like he didn’t look like he was wearing that Loki head piece while carrying the deer 🦌
Watching this for the six time. How many times for you guys?
the fighting moves are awesome
You about to make me buy a freakin ps5 just so I can play this masterpiece
I hope they release it for pc soon as well
anyone else here keeps watching this until something new is shown???
this game is going to be awesome
Tyra FehU Skylls Book3
Game of the year ... loading
It's look like zeus
Mimir is gonna go blind all over again 😅
I wish this game was on Xbox 😔
💚💚💚
I need this so badly!!!!
🔥
When it releases?
This is gonna be on ps4 Also?
the best game ever
I would like an update please. :)
„Are you a calm and reasonable person ?“    Past kratos: ZOOOSS IM COMING FOR YOUUU
трудновато
Kratos saved freya, but she couldn’t understand
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  *Man Thor does not know who he is talking to*
Best game ever
Freya  is A Karen
i hope they added more skill moves
Tyr’s right hand should be missing . Hope they correct that .
Atreus will find love of his life in next sequeal❤️
Everything goes so well til the last moment, can’t believe Santa Monica is doing
Get me pictures of Release Date!
Best soundtrack ever
Any news on this games release date yet?
Kratos post ragnarok be like : ,,Raising you, Atreus, was much harder than destroying the entire asgard."
The girl at the end is Angrboda (acording to subtitles). In mythology, she is to be Loki's wife, and have 3 children with him: Jormungand (now i understand why it calls Atreus familiar during GoW, and why it came from the future), Fenrir and Hela. Of course, the game just don't take the mythology very seriously, yet it was still a cool piece of info.
Why not just make this a movie if they care so little about the gameplay
PLEASE DELAY THE GAME
Can't wait to play it booooooooy!!!
Why is there an African girl in Scandinavia?   Is this game being infected with woke diversity cancer?
Just came to rewatch and I think I seen the valkyries of this game  🤦🏽‍♂️ here we go again
i might honestly buy a ps5 just too play this game ive always wanted to play the gow seires but i have a xbox so yea
So smh no one is talking about how badass this new fimbulwinter attire of Kratos is.
Who's the girl at the end
kid atreus*  Kratos: Bwhoi  teenage atreus:  Kratos: Dude..
i need this game to genuinely take me a week to beat
We want uncharted next game
0:36 Atreus is looking like David Mazouz.
Bro freya coming back for revenge
Yes..!!!..
0:19 or 0:20 if you pause here and see Atreus shadow kind of depict the modern Loki with those horns
Why Atreus voice sounds like Tom Holland's?
Cmon BOY let us destroy the Elden Ring!
Thor : Are you a calm and reas...Wait what's this circle above me?
when the game is coming
فخامه 🔥🔥
Tyr has both hands in the trailer based on that Fenrir might be in the game that’d be a badass boss fight
Here we go boys, no console watchers
Atreus gets on my nerves.....
Well according to santa monica twitter they wrote the following: Dear fans, we at santa monica are fans of our fans and we are so thankful for the huge amount of feedback we have gotten since the announcement of ragnarok. We are aware of your concerns and we hear you. With that being said we have decided to take your advise and not rush this game. We at santa monica would rather as you the fans say "take our time" and give our fans a polished game instead of "a buggy mess." With that being said we have now decided to indeed, take our time and aim for a 2025 release date. Thank you to all of our amazing fans. P.s. -Ragnarok is coming. And b4 u @ me go look at the comments when they announced ragnarok in sept 2020. Yeah, remember u all begged for this."tAkE y0uR tiMe wE d0nT wAnT aN0tHeR cYbeRpUnK"😂😖🤦 But hey at least we have assassin's creed ragnarok to last us until 2025.
i cant see the comment so imma just re type it.  Thor : "are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos : "yes" Thor : "Then why does it say 'Rage of sparta' at the corner of the screen?"
2:35 Atreus' Runic abilities are gonna be bonkers. The guy's riding a summoned dear.
Can't wait to hear some Mimir/Kratos banter again
still waiting for a release date
Kratos: Who are you? Thor: *Shows hammer surrounded by lightning* Kratos:*sighs* Another Zeus
Who is that tall guy?
0:20  The godly presence of Loki Laufeyson.
Kratos is black
Kratos betta be ready
T E E N
One series must be made on Hindu gods
I was excited for this game but im tired of being trolled by santa monica. Its not coming out until 2025. And guess what...                                         ?????              ... I really mean this

All in all…. I hope this game has NG+ 😂
if they decide to kill kratos off, i want him to go out the way logan did.
Only on PS5? Or maybe on 4? I know it's a stretch but c'mon...
I CANNOT WAIT💜💰💰💰
Why does Brock's voice sound different?
Nice
I’m so hype when they game comes
P
Again end of new mythology
Ragnarok state of play, gather!!!!
No ps4? :'(
Is only for. Ps5 ?
I'd b a calm and reasonable person if you'd let me get my way!
Thought this game is free from political correctness until the last moment
I’m back for at least the millionth time to watch this 😂
It's been nearly 7 months at least give us another trailer or an update bro😭
Triple H would be a great candidate to play Kratos
Still waiting...
Goosebumps
Boy
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  ... Oh BOY... You have no idea...
Who is still watching this trailer again and again in 2022 from  6months
I think Tyr knows who kratos is considering his great intelligence
2:46 who's this one?
Tyr like a rasputin
So are we not gonna talk about the fact that the little girl at the end of the trailer KINDA looks like calliope?
release date!!???
is ragnarok only coming for ps5?
Our kids will not say the games we played at their age were lame after this!!!
1:17 minim and hugin
Please relise the game
This looks exactly like GoW. Need to see for myself what's the fuss about. I'd not be surprised if it's just an overhyped product coz of the older game
Idk it just doesn’t give off the same vibes
What’s zendaya doing in the end?
i have a funny theory:what if jormungandr bloaw the horn   im so stupid
I can't really wait to release this game!!!!!
I like how Kratos is like I know you're tall," but I still can mess you up loser
I have the feeling something bad is gonna happen to loki. Captured and tortured in revenge for Baldurs death just like in myth. If this happens Kratos will slap up the whole pantheon. The Egyptian Pantheon will receive the news that the norse Pantheon has fallen to the Ghost of Sparta just as Olympus did. Out of fear they could lash out. Just a crazy theory.
Can't wait for this to release!
Looks to be going woke hope it doesnt but if it does then itll be the death of the series.
Loki is getting some in this title. Nice!
This game is gonna be amazing 🤩
So after playing hfw and Elden ring really can’t wait for this
This is fake
Playstation please give us a release date
Still sad shes black
If this is anything like the previous game then by the God's, it will be a masterful piece of art that only dwarves can craft.
i thought freya was going to get wings
Will kratos still call Atreus "BOI"?
I don't want to fight Freya she literally saved atreus' life but we were forced to kill her son. I hope she forgives us
I am literally friending for this game!!!!!!!!!!!
👦
...is it me or did Kratos took Thor's cloak- cause it looks like Thor's cloak from the ending of the last  game.
I'm looking forward to this game but it has disappointed me in one of my expectations. Freya cannot harm anyone even to defend herself, which made me interested in seeing how they make her a credible threat while under those rules, would take some clever writing. Only to see her appear in front of Kratos and come at him with a sword...seriously?
I wonder if this is gonna be like tlou 2? (If you know what I mean.)
Is this a sequel game or just a DLC? Kind of late on the series 😅
I hope we can see deimos and kratos relationship btw Kratos and tyr
I’m gonna buy this game
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos:              L3+R3
Kratos: Are you coming with us? Tyr stands up Kratos: My bad, we'll go with you.
Do bear in mind that in mythology, Tyr lost his hand to Fenrir for betraying the wolf. Given that he's the last known full-blooded giant, as well as his relatively safe imprisonment, we may see Tyr working with Odin, not that I want to. Alternatively, our heroes might befriend a giant wolf!
Funny how Kratos doesn’t look black anymore. Typical…
In moment of conflict, uncontrolled rage does nothing, harness it, control it, let it serve you!
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment, and start thinking like a general!  Mimir: That lad is what we call an understatement.  Kratos: mhrmm
Just...release it on steam...
Just imagine if they had gotten chris hemsworth for va of thor 😭😭
Yeah im sold so i think in my head is gonna be 50$ i think right or 30$
I’ve watched this over 50 times now. I’m not bored
The way it looks like a movie though. Excited for this new GoW entry
Id sell my infant sister to know when this comes put
1:21
imagine if kratos calls angrboda *GIRL* xD
Imagine time travelling back to 2005 and telling someone that PlayStation’s Kratos would kill the Greek pantheon and decided to settle down and end up taking on the Aesir gods?
Boi..       kratos(2018)
Atreus does want answers. We got to help him and Kratos.
boy
dog
doy
I hope it runs at 4k 60 fps
Tyr is a big guy
can we get a release date already
I can already picture Kratos lifting Thor’s hammer.

He should have two axes instead of one
Can't wait :) Hope it will be released in PC in future
Why is keratosis just greek beowulf
Looks like Freya has allied with Oden.  From the prior game, Mimir stated that one of the curses placed on Freya by Oden was that she can't fight.
Útlægr Guð Smán föður Von móður Þraut barnsins  Útlægr Guð Smán föður Von móður Þraut barnsins  Stríðs sonur Saurgun sannleiks Und svíður  Græð kvöl hans  Útlægr Guð Stormr haturs Vex óttinn Und svíður Ger fortíð upp  Guðs plága Ég syndir ber (Tresyt drengnum) (Sefa height hans)  Blóðs bölvun Óbætanleg (Tresyt drengnum) (Sefa heift hans)  Hann mun fara Ég hef enga(Aflausn)  Útlægr Guð Smán föður Von móður Þraut barnsins  Útlægr Guð Stormr haturs Tresyt drengnum Sefa heift hans  Vex óttinn Und svíður  Hann þjáist Hann þarfnast föður Ekki Guðs  Blóðs bölvun Ég hef enga aflausn  Und svíður Ger fortíð upp
Keep up the AMAZING game
نزلوها
Fighting Thor's gonna be awesome! I hope we get to kill him with mjölnir
Did they get a new voice actor for kratos?
6 month 6 month of nothing of information
Just, beautiful
Is nobody talking about the Anakin Skywalker energy Atreus is exuding here?
My Excitement is Through the Roof!!!!!!
i hope there could be thor to fight lol
I have been waiting for a long time for this
I hope that Atreus gets voice cracks in front of brok and brok bullies him about it
i wish this was on xbox
Kratos was really fighting Thor 😲 😮 😲 😮 😲 😮 😲 😮 😲
2:24 Top tyr wisdom from Kratos
1
We are in April in 2022 and still no set of release date 🥲
I can't wait to play this game already!
Quando esce????
Angrboda a nice, cute, black, giant girl (they have blue skin color actually) ....but yeah ok, I hope she will not be a feminist.
Ps4 version plz..
Kratos knocks down Thor Thor: "wait, let us reason with eachother" Kratos: sees *O* hovering over Thor
Of course... There goes that black character that comes out of nowhere, that will be justified as "Nordics used to travel a lot!" people reinventing history again, and insulting anyone who disagrees wtih this decesion as we would if they give us a old history african game with blond people in it...
Вери найс
Is it on ps4
You seem like a calm and resonable person, are you a calm and resonable person!
Playing this game in Greek voice overs is next level!
That creature half man half horse, does it have a English name? Brings me back to the time I fight it in GOW3
Boys voice is wack 😂
Why isn’t this coming out on ps4? :(
Why’s there a black girl in Swedish myth
Phase -1 raise the boy Phase - 2 raise the teenager

Yeah, remember u all begged for this."tAkE y0uR tiMe wE d0nT wAnT aN0tHeR cYbeRpUnK"😂😖🤦 But hey at least we have assassin's creed ragnarok to last us until 2025.
Santa monica are trolling all of us. They keep posting ig and twitter pics of everything other than the release date. Its been 4 years man.
Man i cant wait for the thor kratos fight
i’m soooooo excited
Tyr has been to Greece and knowing the ghost of sparta I cant imagine he'd be to happy to help him even if it is for his son
Just finished the game on pc... surprisingly the boi is a giant
PC please! PC!
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person”
Crazy this game, more than just a game that my tongue can't describe 😶😶
It's already been 6 months.
No offense to cancel culture people but WHY is there a black person in Ancient Norway -_-
These comments had made me realize how bad I am at paying attention to detail I am or how observant I am
after this comes out  everyone: when is dad of man coming out?
Freya jumps kratos but it backfires
1:48 anyone else here the Lego breaking sound

Whole video GOOSEBUMPS
what atreus said stop thinking like a father for once and start thinking like a general gave me goosebumps like you don't talk to your father like that if I ever did that I would be 6ft in the ground
“In moments of crisis… panic does nothing” ready for more father son pep talks in this game!
Yes mimir ist the Best Character
Why is she black?
Hate to see Freya as an enemy, but cannot wait for this!
Top things I’d hope to see in this coming game(and perhaps what some others want too):  -Kratos meeting Odin -Reveal who blew the horn for the World Serpent in the last game -Atreus finds out why Kratos’s skin is grey hehe -Atreus learning more of Kratos past/ more references to his past -Vanaheim  -MAYBE Kratos being a bit more brutal as his younger self -How Fey(Atreus mother) may have looked like -Thor’s brutality  -Thor finds out that Kratos is a calm and reasonable person   I don’t expect much honestly I already know Ragnarok is gonna be a great game itself but it’ll be really cool seeing these happen
Here’s hoping Rage of Sparta plays in this game.
Is it only ps5?
KRATOS VS THOR LETTTTTTSSSSS GOOOOOOOO
I can't wait to see how they portray atraus with him possibly turning Into lokki
did anyone notice that tyr's rope is attached to a wolf at his back? 2:45
if i had a dollar for everytime i watched this, id buy it day one
Why does Tyr have both his hands
Atreus really out here saying "Father when can I leave to be on my own💅💅💅"
Who's here after 6 months of This Masterpiece ❄🔥Trailer, huh?
Uh, Kratos has faced taller guys before.
I want to know how Freya broke Odin's curse as you see her using weapons against Kratos
I... Shat myself so hard, so many times while watching this
Do you remember in the middle of the game when Kratos, his son and Mimir discover the Oden chambers for the holdings of other worlds, you will find a panel with 4 symbols of war in 4 different civilizations, Greek, Scandinavian and Pharaonic, and I do not know about which civilization the remaining logo
I’m so Hyped for this game I’m currently replaying GOW atm
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"
THEY BROUGHT L1 + CIRCLE BACK!!!
I watch this every morning 😀
Masterpiece
Nicr
Bro kratos hear wearing pelt when in the last game i gave him some legendary armor
I love how the camera shots move around the action line a movie would. Very fluid
Tyr !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IM SO SIKED FOR THIS GAME I WISH I COULD GET IT SOONER 😁
This is giving me game of thrones vibes
I don’t have much to say about Atreus being able to ride his summons now, I just think it’s cool.
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general"  This boy doesn't know about an army who using a spear and a shield, they are so strong, have huge fighting spirit, and Zeus need to wipe out this army by himself using the Mighty Blade of Olympus because other Gods can't do this to that army.
Already half a year?!? Wut
Looks like dlc
I cannot wait for this game 😀🤑😆😁
This video is art, and it should be cherished by newer generations too.
"Are you a calm reasonable person?" Kratos: Yes, only if you don't trigger my anger problems
I cannot wait to impale odin with his spear and beat thor to death with his hammer
who else keeps coming here everyday lol
Man I’d love to play this on the steam deck
2:05 scorpion brutality
İ just finished the game on PC . After gow 1,2,3 this was the game i was wainting for a really really epic moments. Any game can reach this epic level. This game a different "think" really. Now we have to wait ragnarök but it will take at least 3 years to play on PC. Sad but it worth.
*So you keep coming back to this video huh ?*
Alright but how hype would it be if they got Chris Hemsworth to act as Thor in this game.
kratos facing hes fears of raising a teenager
will this be coming to pc at release
*We want a longer game*
how much longer i have to wait for this game ? I can't wait
Maybe this time kratos will fight and go to war to save and stop Ragnarok and not for vengeance
Come on, you've been silenced for too long, give us something, anything!
Thor sounds a LOT like Josh Brolin.
it.s play for ps4 and ps5
Hype Hype Hype HYPE!!!!
Who is the girl at the end? Never saw her before
Can’t wait to play. 🥺
The music for that was trash
Y’all talking about old kratos and how this one is strong or if not stronger however the old kratos had the power of hope which he no longer does as Athena took it so there’s no way that he will be as strong as before
Most waiting game 🎮
Play station I add wishlist ready...friends we wait for ragnarok for this year...feel goosebumps
Hopefully it can be played on a laptop
I don't know but for some reason it gave me Tomb Raider 2014 vibes. Its gonna be epic.
Tyr is Kratos😎
If kratos will forced to fight thor and odin he needs to go back to who he was in order to defeat them And Blade of Olympus
I just bought my PS5 and I can't wait!
This looks like the best game I’ve ever seen 😭😭
This seems like a great set up to tell Atreus about what happened to his last family. It would atleast explan Kratos's hesitation to him.
Im making a prediction that the BOI will call back the Axe like Captain America did in Avengers Endgame    LOL but still hype for these game!!
Can we atleast get a release date
Boring
Finally a settlement that doesn't feel empty
Kratos : Are You Coming With US Tyr : Stand up... Kratos : Ow, You Remember Me To My brother Hercules.
2:22 who else wanted to “Realm Shift” at that moment;)
Officially one of the best trailers i've watched
There's a black kid... IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY! That's it, Elden Ring is officially game of the year!

This game is going to break the internet just watch
2:56 Salvation theme. Baldur's death music.
When ia gone came out
so after norse mythology, is Marvel's Thor next?
It seems like all the upgraded attacks from the previous game are here in base form, gonna be interesting to see what upgrades they do with moves and such.
I can't wait for it. come back as soon as possible for Pc
EL ÚNICO COMENTARIO LATINO ✨😎
Can someone gift me a ps 5 so i can play horizon forbidden west and this one when it comes out. Dont need anything else, just a brand new ps 5 will work thanks.. charity begins at YouTube
I’m a nogga
Atreus got pretty strong if he can carry a deer with little to no struggle at all
I just realized after watching this trailer infinite times, at 2:48 just for milisecond duration, Tyr is nodding his head before getting up as if he's agreeing.
An extremely rare scene of kratos walking without clenching his fists 1:18
can we have Hermes boots as a dlc or something where we can to use them as a side mission in the game.
So can we port over our gear or do I have to spend another 2 years farming gear and hacksilver
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !!!!!!!!
GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP! GIVE US PVP!
Kinda feel bad for freya
Hopefully We Get A Release Date Soooon🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
got age restricted lol
This called power book 5: raising teenage boy😂
I watched this countless times again & again cuz release date and new trailer is not out yet 😅.
My father told me... "Its only 2 games in norse bc santa monica isn't giving their employees all their bonus money up front like they did in the past, bc when they do people take their money and leave. (As they should) This is why they've been hiring for the past 3 years. So instead SSM decided to pay the bonuses out in 3 years instead of up front. Thats just what my dad told me. He's been working for sony for 32 years so idk. I believe him tho.🤷
I want to see the titans return..
There’s about 15 things to list out that need to be answered. How are they doing it in one game?
War never changes
I’m so pumped they are adding city like places. The game felt so barren at times.
Ok yeah I’ll pay about 100000000000000€ for this f game this is cool as shi$ this is crazy and one thing Atreus is a player o my
They grow up so fast
Fun fact, Not only Atreus went through puberty, the voice actor did aswell.
Please make PC port !!
داداشم کریتوس
Release date?
Release date please
This game is taking forever to get a release date it's sad I'll start to lose interest soon
Adventures In Babysitting part 2
The gameplay is literally the exact same and same graphics
This is what happen to the greatest general of spartan when his boy dont get agoge at 7th years old 😅
Why do need to wait i dont want to just give it to me already
3:05 kinda weird for a black person to be in such time and age in such place
Why does it show the weapons not upgraded on kratos's back? Hmmm curious!
I hope they release on PC. Just finished the other game.
Is Santa Monica planning to release this during our last battle against Covid since its ragnarok?
Still waiting for this...
Hope we see Egypt and the other pantheons
The trailer is ayt...
2008:  zooooose 2018: Boy!
Just finished it on the PS5. That 4k made that game looking even more stunning. Cannot wait for Ragnorak
Me waiting for jackseptcye
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice
🪐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2025
no se por que me da escalofrios ver este trailer
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  Goosebumps!
"you do not know what mother wanted" the way he says this line hits different. voice itself is different
what about pc ????
Ps 6?
I was hopping this would been more of a solo game with out his son
Trailer looks boring af
1:23
PlayStation 4 no no ??
yo who tf is that little girl
Please if you have a lot of money give me because I am poor from Iraq and I need money......
Hopefully they reduce op cooldowns and give regular mobs more mechanics
Lança logo! Please!!!
My man cant get rest for a single day.
I wanna play NOW!!!
2:51 low key funny 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻
Act like a General he says … if he only knew
we want the guts and blood that have always characterized this game
Wander is coming
xbox better
please make a kratos prequel with this gameplay before he got the blades of chaos
Nooo
Game of the Year 2022.
are they going on a trip to the african land of gods, pretty cool pretty cool.
Looks like some people dont realize how badass that scene with Tyr is
This'll be great once it releases on PC. I don't understand why Sony is so allergic to making money? They'd make double or triple the profits if they released it on PS and PC at the same time. Most PC gamers that have spent a few thousand on their rig aren't going to shell out for a PS5 and most console owners aren't going to shell out thousands for a new PC so it's not like it's going to hurt their console sales.
wait, EKKO???????
Kratos is about to be a 2 time mythology champ
is the game going to be a DLC for the original game, or a complete new full game?
Atreus hits puberty harder than Kratos brutally beating the Olympian gods
When it will come to pc
I feel like the fight against thor would be a mascar and it'll destroy everything in it's way including kratos house wich explain why his in a cave
The girl at the end will probably like Atreus’s Version of Athena and Kratos will probably do all he can to stop Atreus from killing her accidentally out of Rage like he did to Athena in the past so he can stop events from repeating
Not sure how much I like teen voice of boy.
You seem like a calm and reasonable person   Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Thor certainly cutting to  the heart of the matter
1.35 graphics issue. axe and blades get tangled.
Atreus: I wanna find out who loki is  Me: You are!
Time travel is kind of confusing. Loki and Angrboda give birth to the world serpent and Fenrir. I believe fenrir and hati are the wolves that carry Kratos to med guard after the ending of gow 3. When Thor knocks the World serpent back in time, this causes him to meet the boy who turns out to be his father and that’s why the serpent recognizes him. I’m thinking Faye was the one on the shrine commanding the wolves to carry Kratos away. Here in the trailer we see Angrboda Who apparently hooks up with atreas later to birth two of the main characters in Ragnarok. It’s confusing because Faye was supposed to be the last of the Giants, she gave birth to atreas making him half giant causing him to be the last of the Giants but Angrboda is a giantess herself
🔥
I just realized that Fenrir will Be Kratos' grandchild
13 million let's go
KRATOS CAN SPIDER MAN CLIMB AGAIN
"war is not the only way"  Your in the wrong game kiddo
That last scene is definitely the end of the game, to enter...  The Age of Egypt
playing GOW since 2005...wow. what a journey for me now close to... middle age. great stuff sony and santa monica. BIG THANK YOU.
I can't wait to play this masterpiece
1:38 yes, what has happened to him indeed
Well not just kratos toughest new Enemy and former ally-turn enemy But his son Atreus well be his Toughest challenge that he will face
vou esperar sair no pc pra eu piratear
13 million's is coming
two games coming to ps that I love and I just bought a pc 😒
Bruh it's gonna be fire af 🔥
stop thinking like a father
This applies perfectly to the Russia-US climate. Should we stay strong on our stances but also try as hard as possible to avoid conflict? Or is war inevitable…? How can we know peace when our enemy is so bent on our demise?
Atreus: Odin! save my father and my life is yours!!
This is beautiful  I've been looking at this for 5 hours now
Seems like Asgard started a war with kratos
Theory : The World Serpent is actually kratos himself who somehow travelled back in time and transformed into serpent.. that's why he speak ancient language, obeys atreus and can hold/keep the frost axe..
boi cant wait
*watches once a day.
Please Sony, make a PC VERSION of this one again. Please please please please
I loved almost everything about 2018 game. But so many enemies and bosses where same just a different texture paint. But Ragnarok appears to be have many different enemies. Santa Monica really fixed that issue
Data lansării??
vandha valiya paathu odru thoruu...
Почему удалили мой комент? Я разве не объективно высказался по поводу двойных стандартов компании "санта моника"? В отношении Тора - стараемся блюсти канон, а в отношении черной Ангебордой - творческий прорыв чердака?
This is coming out on ps4 too??, I'm pre ordering 😫😫😫🤤.
02:53 hello again hercules-
Y’all think we’ll get to kill thor and Odin this game or wait until the third installment of this saga 🤔, I think the third game will be killing Loki or letting Loki kill us it was hella foreshadowed in the 2018. With the wall prophecy and Kratos saying he would let his son kill him to see him live
Who’s that? Is it zeus?
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I just finished GoW4. I’m ready when you are Thor.
Yoo the new game looks sickkkk
Soo when the game comig out?
“Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general” ….boy you do not know what you have to go through for that…..although hopefully your grandsons will help,
whos watching this trailer still in awe in march 2022
A subsaharan Norse diety? I know kratos is from Greece, but making a Norse diety as subsaharan without any explanation is the same as making Egyptian gods as chinese
Are we gonna talk about Atreus foreshadowing as Loki right in the beginning with the antlers? 👀👀👀👀 that gave me chills
atreus thinks his more than his father
The old Blades of Chaos are back!
I know it won’t come to pc on launch but I want it so bad
What I'm most hyped about is that we'll get too travel to all 9 realms
release also for ps4 not just for ps5 still people can't have it @playstation

Love how you show a brown girl at the end of the video 😂
Who is the guy that appears in the bifrost summon?
Sadly its for ps5:( i only have ps4
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please ASAP
meh
Can’t wait for this to get out! ❤️✨
Is that a Ukranian flag Atreus is wearing? 1:38
The only letdown of this Trailer for me is the Angrboda part.. i mean, what??
tyr
its so cool please unlock now
*Weapon unlocked:* Thors hammer
Hehe
1:51 war is not the only way
I hope this game available on pc
super👌🤟🤛😎😎😊😬🥵🥵
Kratos says “there’s another way besides war” because he knows EXACTLY how HE gets when its WAR time 😈🔥
wow Tyr is big
I can't wait to see see how much stronger Kratos has gotten between the last game and Ragnarok, he's definitely been training for Thor after that fight with Baldur, also he has way more devetasting and powerful attacks in this trailer than the last game, and he seems to of gained even more muscle, if you look closely he's even more ripped in this than the last game.
GOTY 2022🔥
its been years and that haircut still mohawk
I think a question that this trailer doesn't answer is: WILL BOI STILL BE CLINGIN' ON FATHER'S BACK??
The only game that I am willing to pay full price.
Kratos: ...Teenager!  Atreus/Loki: Yes, Father?
I know how kratos lived… maybe idk but babe he stabs himself so he could release the power of hope.The interesting part is, that when he stabbed himself, he gained the power from the sword, thus the blade becomes lifeless (doesn't glow anymore being practicaly just a mere sword). That's how
anyone else think the actor for thor sounds like thanos??
Sooooo are they gonna address that Atreus shooted his dad ever? Cause kratos said that they still had to discuss that...
Kratos is definitely more white than last game and his beard in more dark /black compared to the brown one in last game almost like he is rejuvinating a bit i like it
2:26 stop it... it's look like Jottenheim or not ???!!!

We need a release date
Are this also available for PS 4?
I need this game to come to PC..
What if Microsoft bought Santa Monica one day before ragnaroks release?
Boy? More like man hahahah..... Get it?
Cara fan jogo logo
looks amazing. A tad disappointed they'd show finding tyr in the trailer.
LAST GAME FOR KRATOS. ITS BEEN A LONG DECADE RIDE. LOKI WHILE TAKE HIS PLACE AFTER THIS GAME.

If I'm not mistaken, this game will be released as a bundle with the 2018 game. I don't know
war is not the only way (kratos)
I hope we get to choose the appearances of the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos in the game… I’m a fan of the more simplistic and basic look of the weapons over that over the top decorative look that happens whenever we upgrade the weapons.
Release date
ive watched this so many times and it gives me chills each and every time
2:28 Seem's like we did help the wrong side.
Duuuuuude
Our boy is becoming a man 😭
Can't wait to see Krato's son as a big men soon.
The girl is Loki and Atreus love loki
Atreus is getting into his Emo phase.
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  Shows kratos destroying a draugr
In Norse mythology, Ragnarök means the end, I think it was kratos ’last journey.
This has to be beyond amazing to beat elden ring
Still greek Kratos >>>>>  For me but yea ik he's now a mature person nd calm but still
I hope the upgrades aren't as fancy. But rather beautiful metal, wood and leather work.
I think they shouldn't have spoiled Tyr.
I hope this will be on ps4
Thor vs Kratos will be the most epic fight in video game history and knowing GOW creators, they don’t disappoint. Can’t wait for this game!!
Can’t wait to destroy Thor, loki, and Odin 😈
Whos the girl at the end? Seemed like they revealed her at the end to be some kind of big deal.
We went this game on also ps4 🙂 Why you guys forget about ps4 so early💔
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person.... Kratos's backstory:
game of the year❤❤
Вы в Devil may cry поиграйте, она ещё интереснее, больше комбо. Пальцы горят просто.
Awesome! I can't wait to play it! I  just hope it will be ported to the PS4 though.
Just a thought no need to think hard about it.  Since we took Baldur away from Freya, will she take Atreus from us? I mean what better way of revenge than turning Atreus against Kratos....
Day one to pc
who was the person shown in the last who was bigger than kratos
Are you calm and reasonably person? Kratos: NO! L3+R3
Does nobody see that they made the blade of his axe smaller?
Love it! Hope that i dont have to wait for 4 years, until they release it for PC. P.S. Could people please stop pushing diverse characters where they CANNOT be by default. I mean...
The fact they show Angrboda at the end tells us that Atreus is gonna get some of that Jotunbussy
Memory kicked in why i left xbox for PlayStation...
Çıksın artık bee
just finished on PC, one of the greatest games from the last 5 years easily
GOW 1: AREEEESSSS! GOW 2: ZUUUSSSSSS! GOW3: ZUUUUUUSSSSSSSS!!! GOW 4: boi GOW 5 : odinnnn
Kratos looks somewhat younger to me in this game then he did the last one.
Dont fix what isn't broken. Just improve it. Cannot wait to play this. Gonna do another playthrough here soon.
I'm excited I can't wait until it comes out next year in 2023 when they delay it lol🥰😓😅😭🤣😂🙄😒
make this game for pc at the same time or close to the ps5 release. i promise there are thousands of people who got a pc and arent going to buy a ps5 to play games in a way they arent used to( mouse and keyboard) xbox is starting to do it. games like gof of war and Spiderman dont need to be just playstation exclusive. yall would make bread if it on pc :(
Now I see why baldr thought kratos would be bigger
2:12
Is this coming in 2022?
Where is the signature “BOYYYYY”.
I just finished 4th on Pc.. right now..   cant wait to play this too...
3:00 hopefully she is talking about the release date😂
I love Atreus’ clothes and design so much!!! The fact that he is wearing his fathers old tunic around his waist is *mwah* It means that Kratos truly let go of his past and let Atreus in on more of his Greek heritage!
Santa Monica
I got goosebumps
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😋😋
why is the ps5 is there as preorder? its been a long time since it's release no?
SOoooooo where is the game?
1:56
this game is gonna shake whole gaming market mark my words
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" "Fine" Next moment : "Why are we in egypt...where's home?"
this is the best game
kratos getting old 😢
Welp they just said 2024 is the release year
The cool thing is my uncle can play as Baldur because his height and all out look is like baldur except the beard and hair
Is it Zeus
Atreus's face looks weird
Watch they actually get Chris Hemsworth to voice Thor for this game. I swear it’d break the entire internet (I doubt it’ll happen tho)
I’m soooo exited wooooooooooooow
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person" *Meanwhile Kratos violently ripping people apart*
Please continue the series! Make in Egypt in other cultures with all of the gods! I will buy every game! This game it is sooo awesome!!!!
We can already tell that the game is going to be peak fiction

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
finally looks like we can sprint
OH I WANT IT, I WANT IT, I WANT IT!!!!!!!!
Best game ever ❤
Atreus finna get some badussy
I came here once a week to enjoy this masterpiece.  This trailer always gives me chills. ❤❤❤
Were about to see atreus go ham.
When Kratos says "War is not the only way" at 1:51. If you look at his hands, he's holding onto the bag he and Atreus carried Faye's ashes in. He's still carrying his wife even after they brought her back to her people to rest.
Ape in the north, LOL
BOY
I did not know there was a trailer until now
Santa Montica, have my children.
Gonna have to get a ps5 just to play this game.
0:21when Atreus show up in the fog he really does look like Loki.
*Thor's gotta be scary* *He should be an equal to Kratos*
People who have watched Marvel and think that Loki is Thor's brother, you are insignificant)
Ragnarock'n roll baby!
“Boy, put down that phone and read the rune”
Thor's voice gives me the chills
I’ve bought ps5 just for this game 👌👌👌
man this gonna be a banger m buying a ps5 just for this when it becomes available

Is this only for PS5?
Do y'all realize that Kratos is 7,6 in height, tyr looks at least 11 foot tall. Imagine a 11 foot tall guy walking twords you with a killer intent😭🙏
My mind at 2:57 "When is the release date?" Angrabora at 3:01 :
I hope this comes to the ps3 and ps4 as well
Wait. Where is Zeus?

Can't wait for it
Kindly release the game soon
1:50 is that atreus using his own chaos blades?
Loki

Kratos vs Chris Hemsworth

Wait... isn't he Roman...how does Norse mythology enter this?
It’s about time we get a new trailer.
ps, why deceive us that it will only be released on ps 5?
Is this gonna be ps5 exclusive since I only got a ps4
That is skoll and hati pulling the sled yes?
Mimir writing with his mouth??? TAKE MY ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS
Angerboda. Wife of Loki?
i really hope we don't have to kill freya
Let me guess, they won't be able to stop Ragnarok.
I hope this game will be released for PC as well
Bro if this is the last game of this mythology and the final boss is Odin I feel it will be harder then the valkyries
insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei
Available on ps4?
THOR: Are you a calm and reasonable person  KRATOS: You'll see soon enough... L3+R3
IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS...... PANIC DOES NOTHING.... HARNESS IT.... LET IT SERVE YOU............... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

3:05 black women in North mythologie Yep 😑 why not  But dont add anthor black plz
щегол подрос)) и бесит в разы больше.
Please let this release on pc… 🙏
I'm so happy to see Sindri returning
2:54 who is that new guy please someone reply?
I believe can play this game in pc😥
I want this
I still find it hard to believe that this will be the finale of the Norse saga Well if they say that then they better make it worth the effort
💙🅿
Y3ah
Blade of olimpus
atreus' voice is gonna take some getting used to
After killing all of the greek and nordic gods the only thing left for him to do is to fight goku in the namekian realm
GIVE US THE REALEASE DATE
To stop a ragnorok war.. Loki suggests a war.. umm.. isn't tht ragnorok. Loki and his cunnings..
GOTY !
just finished part 1 on Pc as i dont have playstation Sony please release this one sooner on pc we all wanna have fun
Wonder if fraya is working with Odin now , last game she was cursed to not fight even to defend herself but she was attacking kratos in this trailer
I am both happy and sad. I won't be able to play this one just cause I don't have a ps5. I wonder when they gonna release this one for PC.
please make this game for pc
So since there's probably people now. Will there be a brothel because I do be missing the minigam-
I NEED IT NOW
This is Going to be Day 1 of the Day 1 Pre order.
Can't wait to see fenrir biting tyr hand off
This is freaking exciting
Hoping the combat is as fluid as Arkham Knight this time round
No character ark. Not getting it.
Boy grewup!!
greek ➡️ norse ➡️ egyptian ➡️ Marvel univers
Atreus:Stop thinking like a father for a moment and Stat thinking like a general.  Og gow fans:Idk man the last time he acted like a general he destroyed a whole country and nearly everything in it.
Tyrrr🥶🥶🥶
Of course they had to put a black person in this game. And at the end of the trailer too like " oh and dont forget.. DIVERSITY!" 😂
Kratos:"War is not the only way!" Me:"Sorry, come again?"
I'm really hoping that with the introduction of Tyr, he has no trust for Kratos and only refers to him as the Ghost of Sparta. We gotta remember, Tyr traveled to Greece and presumably either saw Kratos  during his rampage or saw the aftermath. I believe it's Tyr who's asking if he's a reasonable person, just to see what Kratos' response is and then says something that makes Kratos realize that Tyr either knows a shitton about Kratos or that they have met, but Tyr was seemingly in disguise. I'm seriously hoping they aren't buddy buddy and constantly clash when it comes to Atreus, not a full on boss fight or anything, but more of a clash of ideals and further strengthening Kratos' new perspective
I think Loki is son of Laufy and Faye after death of Laufy with all giants Kratos met Faye and adopted him as atreus ,that's why he don't like him so much, rudely behaves with him and always calles him as fu*in "Boyeee"🤣 it's my theory.(don't take it seriously)
BOY!
Semoga pas bagian scene ada tombol yang harus di pencet kaya dulu
whens it coming too PC
Svartalfheim confirmed!
Wir freuen uns! Mach schnell! danke!
you cant stop ragnarok
I like how Kratos has developed as a character
So is kratos going to call him “boy” or “teen” now?
Well according to santa monica twitter on 12/19/21 they wrote the following: Dear fans, we at santa monica are fans of our fans and we are so thankful for the huge amount of feedback we have gotten since the announcement of ragnarok.

This game had the best combat outside of dark souls. Looks even better now.
this is a calm and reasonable reveal trailer
almost forgot to watch this today
So clever to have Atreus enter with the antlers merged with his silhouette.
I love how Mimir is just apart of the family now
existence of that dark skinned girl is proof that atreus truly is loki
Can't wait for it !
Please Don't Make For Only PS4 & PS5 Exclusive Please Launch For Pc Also 😢😢😢
Is Atreus based off of Orion?
I need this asap
Hurry up already!!! Looks amazing and flows on from the last one well.👍🤞
1:54
Men and women of culture We meet again
Oh boy! Never got so hyped a game untill now!
i love how kratos went from a godkiller who a dude who just wants his son to be happy
PLEASE RELEASE ON PC I JUST PLAYED TBIS MASTERPIECE
Oh so Tyr lives, I do like my details revealed in a trailer
what!! no pc??, I just started to like kratos playing gow 4
This legit looks like it can be the greatest game ever made. Kratos' development from PS2 to PS5 brings tears to my eyes!
Wow, afroskandinav🤣
can i say that i'm a bit disappointed that there doesn't seem to be much of improvement from the latest one?
Tyr Is so Tall WOW
HOW AM I JUST SEEIONG THIS SHOWCASE???????????
Kratos is still as strong and limitless as ever.
This game is gonna be dope ash!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Will there be a ps4 version?
Atreus entry as Loki with buck antlers 0:23
Can't wait to butcher another Pantheon.
I really hope Kratos' calm and reasonable general cape can be worn anytime while playing the game! Bring on Ragnarok 😈
I would have loved to see Nemea's fists in this new game
I cant wait for this game just imagine when you're playing with mjolnir
i kinda want kratos to take his beard off and turn bloodlusted again
I'm betting they edited out freyas wings for this trailer, she seems to fly away after attacking kratos.
1:54 - "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general." "NO." 2:24 - Starts talking like a general who also happens to be a father.
Жду в 2022
If only I could get my hands on a ps5
We need a PC release as soon as possible
Are the wolves skoll and hati? because atreus is loki
Please Sony.  Please don't let us wait for another 4 years to play this on PC.
Atreus sieht aus wie ein 13-jähriger hauptschüler mit gucci tasche der in der pause capital bra hört
im starting to wonder if mimir will ever tell atreus kratos' stories as the ghost of sparta when he's not in sight.
Who's that tall guy at the end?  Kratos brother?
It's hard for kratos to raise a teenager
Still playing the recent one on pc, what an experience it´s like playing a movie and i can´t stop.
boi if they make this a movie it would beat lord of the rings
Is that a centaur I see? *Flashbacks to GOW3 Kratos spilling horse intestines.*
kratos uses the blade of exile again, after a long time
Happy they explain how kratos travel to nordik myth
I hope mimir gets a new body somehow at the end
You seem like a calm and reasonable person
There needs to be a scene where Kratos calls Atreus “Man”
Kratos m gonna smash asgard now after olympus
Just a reminder that everyday is one day closer to being able to play this master piece
Loki should be in this game
I hope this game is better than the previous one .
Can we get a date now with a preorder
I just hope there's a big cast since this is the last norse game.
That girl at the end reminded me of the Nora.
Is that one enemy sent down from the rainbow bridge on Asgard?
2:31 That move with the shield is the same as the 2nd move you do with the upgraded spartan charge in GoW4.
Please release this on the PC, at least don't make us wait 4 years like the current GOW game.
I dont want kratos I want The Ghost of Sparta
didnt like the woke stuff at the end
A ps4
Open world ????
Thor has some of the lamest dialogue ever but they make it sound cool somehow.
I bet you that girl is Amora.
fckers we need ps5 to play this game plz make more ps5  mother fckers
Come on already
20 seconds in and the foreshadowing is already there, on point. I can’t wait for this game!
I came
I think the girl is an introductory character for Egyptian mythology...
''In moments of crisis panic does nothing harness it let it serve you''
LETSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Please make this for the Ps4.😢😥🥺🥺 there's no way I will be able to get a ps5 anywhere. Last year was a disaster and this year seems worse. 😕  I gots my Ps4 Pro ready and waiting.
Yooo here's a theory, The light elves or Freyr himself brought Kratos to Midgard from Olympus. The light elves needed Kratos' help to take the light of Alfheim back from the dark elves. The light elves knew the bifrost would need the light and Kratos unknowingly would come to Alfheim kill the Dark Elves and retuning the light back into the control of the light elves.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  "Idk, you tell me"
Goty 2022.
Kratos:- Ares,discipline this boy and my life will be yours...
We want to see this game in STEAM
When pc version available
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Left Shift + Middle Mouse Button
This game is incredibole! I can’t wait
Thor:- you seem like a calm and reasonable person ,  Kratos:- You haven't played my previous games,  have you ?
Waiting for it on PC (steam) 😁😁
STOP THINKING LIKE A FATHER AND START THINKING LIKE A GENERAL Me: ok you should probably shut your mouth
I hope that amulet of Kvasir still works here.
For me I want to listen to boy  And the game should be like boy of war Ragnarok
WAR, war, War, WAr, WaR, waR wAr, wAR!
2:54 got a kratos vs herculess flashback
Now kratos gotta deal with the emo phase
Idk why do i feel Tyr is gonna betray Kratos and Literally take him to Odin.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  Cuts to him mutilating everything on sight
“No.”  Kratos, Art of War
I wonder if Atreus is curse with spartan rage still gives him the sickness. And i wonder if Kratos reveals that he is the Ghost of Sparta
*Boy!………. Oh boy* Can’t wait!
Can't wait for this game
This looks phenomenal
NO!!!!!!!!!   BAM!!!
GUYS?  GIVE US A DATE OR SOMETHING PLEASE 😭😭😭
The real question everyone should be asking is if this games is gonna have a PC port 5 years after it's release?!
I don't know why they are introducing knew characters tough we are know that ultimately kratos will win and defeat every one whosoever the opponent???
what would have happened if Thor knew loki used a butter knife to kill one of his sons.   lets see how calm and collected thor will be after that...
if this was a commercial on tv id watch it without hesitation
Freya’s back. And surprise, surprise; she out for revenge.
The time cannot come soon enough!!!!
I just realized they re-shot the Thor entrance scene to have Atreus as a teenage boy.  Or maybe they just re-shot it to have Atreus wear the Ragnarok outfit?
Had to play it and finish it this week, bought a console just for this , now I know, now I´m ready
me when YT asks me to log in while on my smart tv...
Thor:are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos : Sure Just let me grab my blade of harmony 😊
B
I noticed Tyr still has both of his hands. I wonder how far in the game until he loses one of them?
Can’t wait to see Kratos beat the life out of Thor
will it be available on pc. I don't really wanna pay 400 buck on ps5 just to play this game. Well i would if it doesn't come out on pc but will it?
i'm wondering how much we'll have to wait to have this game on pc too
Cant wait to play this on pc in 5 years
So I guess I’m gonna buy a ps5 🤷🏼‍♂️
Release the game soon sp excited for this legendary game ☺️
Tyr is alive??
Atreus hit puberty hard 💀💀💀
Im excited for the game but i dont want freya to be my enemy😪
GÚT CHÓP !!!!
I wouldn’t be surprised if Thor destroys their house in the beginning of the game, which is why they are camping out in a cave
Boy hit the old Spartan general button. He shouldn't of did that
Kratos is far from a calm and reasonable person 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Prepare for Dad of BOY: Ragnarok
Tyr is huge
what is the relesing date we cant wait plz make it quick
1:35 Sindri is giving me Luigi vibes
here we go killing valkyries again to get Zeus armor
It will release on Sept 30 2022
Guy needs to eat more before even thinking of fighting me
If I get my hands on this game I’m not playing any other game except this game until I beat it every Easter egg everything in this entire game just like I did the other one
and it's can't jump again
but can it jump ?
Honestly, really dope of them to release on PS4 too
Do you guys think we’ll see Odin in this game?
Is it me or is kratos looking younger
Alguien podría explicarme porque angrboda es negra ???????
Idk why but I feel like Atreus is related to Tyr through his mother🤔
(You seem like a calm and reasonable person) (are you a calm and reasonable person?)
I like it's takeing like 3 years rag post  to start in 3-4 years to start so this be fun
This is going to be EPIC
Pls be on ps4 cmon
CAN WE APPRECIATE HOW EVERY HIT IS PERFECTLY TIMED TO THE MUSIC
And for pc? :D
Generic
will dis game can play 60fps on ps4 pro tho?
“War is not the only way.” “Then what else can we do?” “………………” “Dad?” “………hand me my axe.”
Yes
I have a feeling that they won't kill thor though, maybe im wrong  Since they've promised not to kill gods
Man I can’t wait!!!
Want a release date sooooo bad 😔😔😔
I hope Jacksepticeye plays this one! I really loved his playthrough of the previous game!!
this is why i need the ps5
Imagine Kratos gets back sword of olympus and use it against Thor xD I think that would be just so amazing
Kratos doesn't look too healthy. His form is thinner and he has dark rings around his eyes. Is my homie sick?
"They made Kratos soft"  No, they made him a father.
Tyr is the Greek kratos
Is Chris Hemsworth dubbing Thor
Yes this the best games no game can beat this game
2:52   The crescendo of that trumpet...sheer goosebumps.
OHMAYGHAD. Loki's voice is like the voice from The Sword in the Stone kid from that animated film way back 1963. Hahahaha that voice is very nostalgic. But I know it aint him tho, the similarity is just uncanny
Full game when is coming??
Just completed GoW on PC.... what an absolute masterpiece... I hope Ragnarok gets ported to PC too.. Talk about a perfect character development.. from the wrathful Ghost of Sparta to a reasonable father and warrior... Hats off to Santa Monica Studios!
In the End His Son will become his Most Greatest Enemy.💯 Kratos knows this. Everyone in Gow 1-3 was telling him his Fate within the Father/son situation like chronos & Zeus. We will have to just find out after Kratos Beats Thor
Did an enemy just get sent to Kratos using the Bifrost? 2:11
I hope we get another docu on making this game. i still have goosebumps from the Raising Kratos docu
I just want to be kratos son as kratos is so badasss
Just counting down the days til i can get my hands on this game
Nice to see Kratos finally fighting Odogaron
Amazing 🥰💚
Very cool voice actor for thor
I love the imagery when Atreus walks in to the cave carrying the deer. For a split second it looks he's donning Loki's trademark horns
I'm so hype
I can’t wait for this to drop! I’m glad to born in the 20th century!
Freya is fighting Kratos but Mimir said that Odin took her will to fight. My theory is that she was so enraged at Kratos that she returned to Odin just so he would undo the curse. Even if that turns out to not be the case, it's clear that her hatred for Kratos is stronger than her hatred for Odin.
Are you a clam and a reasonable person?
Don't want to be racist but Who the Last girl is in the viking mythology?  I mean really, someone knows  ? :)she is really link to northern mythology ? Thanks
Freya was cursed to never be able to fight again... perhaps Odin has granted her warrior spirit back to her.
Когда выйдет игра??
Why does the Leviathan axe and Blades look like Level 1? :)
Listen, I'm not saying this ain't gonna a killer game. What I am saying tho, is I hope the bosses aren't all just reskined trolls this time round. They were like, half the boss lineup man.
The game looks gorgeous
Is the giant the same as the titan?
Is it just me or Kratos appear more older in this trailer ( better graphic details ? )
Jumping confirmed : 1:47
Wow... WHO WAS THE BLACK GIRL AT THE END?!?!?
Santa Monica Studios if you reading that comment, Release that masterpiece for PC asap too after ps release
Next level ❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💐💐
i like how tyr is as tall as kratos while sitting down
Our boy is a teenager now, he getting closer to became our "man"
Man, imagine we get boots of hermes, how cool would that be.
Hype!
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos : oh absolutely. Meet my axe:  Calm and my blades: Reasonable.
Be nice if we could get a release date.
they should make a show or movie on this game like the Witcher did with there's
So wait, does this mean Atreus will meet another of his children? Like Hela?
boy
Thor's voice sounds like Thanos and since we are gonna fight him hehehe I'm gonna enjoy throwing The Laviathan axe at his Head And Spartan Rage FISTS OF FURY PUNCH HIM IN HIS FACE
Can Santa Monica Studios make a open world mmorpg on Mobile?.. idc if its 15gb. When they swing, they never miss.. look at this.. im gonna play and enjoy it..
Have anyone Recognised Those 2 Wolves Look's so similar From Mythology?
I think they're in a cave in the beginning because after the fight with Thor early on, their house blows up
please say its gonna be on PC day 1 if not at least after a month
I really hope we don't kill Freya
Um santa monica can please hurry and realease my wallet is open and ready
Fingers crossed Fenrir makes a appearance
congratulations on the game graphics but i wish there was one more kratos weapon
Lets go kratos 😘😴
So last game you’re in boats, this game you’re going to be in a lot of dog sleds
Kratos's  favourite catchphrases : ares, head,boy. and arghhhhhhh,  spartan  (rage intensifies)
hype ... just so much hype
Kratos and B I G    B O I  this will be awesome.
I wish Atreus didnt look so soyboyish
I’m hype
I’m mad at how they did TC Carson dirty still, hopefully they can do something for Carson like going back in time and seeing a young kratos or flashbacks of young kratos with Carson’s voice. It bugs me that they didn’t do that in gow 4 in hellheim
Next Egyptian gods, then Asian...then finally Judeo-Christian.  This series has a lot of steam left.
Imagine Chris Hemsworth as thor voice actor
please be game of the year award. please be game of the year award. please be game of the year award
“Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general”  Atreus has no idea how deep that goes for Kratos
Can't wait for this to melt my PC when it comes to Steam in 2024
make it fast . sony your sales gonna boom out. i'll fkin buy your stocks
Take my money !!
Rugnarokiee
i want another documentary, thank u :)
Atreus as an angsty teen. Kratos better get ready for a lot of cleanup and the sounds of "My Chemical Romance"
Is it just me or anyone else wanted to see Blade Of Olympus return on this one?
I LOVE Sony pls give for pc again !!!
So whats the deal with the girl at the end ? Will they set up the Egyptian pantheon next ?
I like Thor's design here more than the MCU
Just stopping by to rewatch and recharge my immense hype. Bye now, have a super day.
Who’s the tall guy at the end, I forgot 😥
Please Sony and fans don’t put presion on Santa Monica if this game doesn’t releases in the date  Patience we don’t want a cyberbug or a GTA definite edition
Kratos enters Asgard Thor- father a Tattooed guy with a boy entered our territory Odin- Gather your things son, we are leaving.
I am filled with much anticipation.
I had to hold this trailer off until I finished the game and I’m so glad I did. Atreus/Loki, Freya out for our necks and Tyr revealed I can’t wait
Kratos better fight his past in this game some how
I really want Tyr to say "I know who you are spartan, I know what you did."
I thought I saw Kratos fighting Sleipnir in this trailer.
What is the benefit that the game will come out on the computer and the PlayStation device, why the PlayStation logo at the end of the game, the biggest mistake is the loss of credibility of the exclusives in electronic devices
awts only ps5 😢😢😢
Yesssir
I cannot afford a play station but atleast i can watch gameplays at YouTube 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Hope this game got a pc adaptation. I just 100% GOW(2018) from the day pc port release, I enjoyed every moment in the game.
3:04 Smelling some woke in here...
Those areas seem like they didn't need a lot to be created some lazy wooden platforms , and i hope it will have some enemy/boss variations this time
When is the relase date
Okay, my interest is peeked
Okay, my interest is peeked
You seem like a clam and a reasonable person.
cant wait to get this on game pass oh wait pwahahaha
how many time did u watch this trailer
Ah, the wolves pulling the sled, nice touch!   Wonder if they'll ever have Atreus learn shapeshifting as a game mechanic. I know the summons are still there but it's not quite the same as physically transforming into them and mauling enemies. I can see why they wouldn't, but it would be nice all the same.
Im playing GOW at the moment. Im finding it a bit repetitive.
Yes bro
The push to improve on 2018's shortcomings shows here, even more dynamic combat, TONS of new enemy designs, not 1 draugr or hellwalker appeared, if Ragnarok simply repeats what 2018 did and simply cleans up the flaws it'll be regarded as a true masterpiece
If only we can play the son too
Is this coming to PC early?
Bruh... BOY is becoming a MAN
Its beautiful, I've watched it for hours now. It's still beautiful
Atreus honestly looks really nerdy
lol, mimir trying to paint with his mouth
I love Kratos and Atreus
Surely we get Thor's hammer when we kill him.
0:19 nice to see that Artreus finally found the direction of deer
Why is there a random black girl in this Nordic adventure
1:59  They're probably people from Asgard sent by Odin to defend the door Tyr was held in.
Thor: You can’t beat me! Kratos: I know, but he can (Tyr) Thor: Hey that’s my line!
Another month down baby
I thought Mimir's head belonged to Odin?
Why do I feel that Atreus will repeat history and kill his father Kratos at the end of all this. Atreus is Loki after all n remember when Atreus asked him why did his mother call him that and kratos said that’s a question for another day. He’s probably trying to turn Atreus from his true destiny as a evil person
Atreus is getting stronger with time is worring me that he would turn against his father at some point..
Kratos!!!! Gaand phad de enemies ki 🔥 Full rock on, on release
Please let this be a 100hr + game, it looks gorgeous!!! Can't wait to immerse myself again.
I guess wisdom comes with age, especially those who survived every kind of calamity
Bring Deimos back
This game will be game of the year.
The amount of detail they go into in all aspects of the game is astounding. From the scenery to the dialogue. Kratos was hasty to answer "NO!" after Atreus demands him to think as a general because he has faced the consequences of doing so before. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds.
- War is not only way Really?)
Release the game
Amazing Powerful game💪💪💪❤❤❤👍👍👍😄😄 very Nice Outstanding waiting for this Masterpiece❤❤❤💪💪👌
Baker video
Release for PC too, come ooooon
Kind of hoping a new lockdown hits when this release's
I do hope Santa Monica tries to launch it as fast as possible for pc, knowing about exclusives makes me sad that i need to wait many years to play such a beautiful, immersive game. Thank you for your work, and all the love from a brasilian fan <3
Why does Tyr have two hands?
Is it coming to pc aswell???????????
bro kratos has some rinkels in his neck
hey have u heard of  the hit game AMONGUS
Nobody talking about the blades of chaos making a return
War, war never changes.     Wrong game sorry.
The seems like a calm and reasonable trailer… :-)
Boy of War is growing.
I like how Tyr kinda looked at Kratos like "I thought you'd be bigger... But you're definitely the one"
Not even 20 seconds in and they give that huge foreshadowing with Atreus's silhouette.
Lowkey kinda wish they gave more characters an accent because hearing their voices, especially Atreus' voice in such a region of the planet just seems like they're all American
it's going to come to the PC in 2026
It's so sad to think we will have to fight Freya...I loved her :(
I can't wait to see what's going to take the place of the Valkyrie boss fights in Ragnorok
These games really are a mark of Sony allowing games into the cinematic space. I’m elated that they are both critical and commercial successes, but we will start seeing the rise of some games akin to Oscar bait movies.   Games that are incredibly well made in bold narrative but either mechanically unsound or just boring to play.   You know, like the best pictures list.
"War is not the only way".... The irony
I like that they showed a couple of scenes with Kratos getting rekt just for us scrubs.
The comment section here is pure  gold  :D lol
Give us a release date! I cant stand this wait!  Kat, Bucharest Romania
3:06 zendaya
Sad that its not on ps4
Tyr looks way smaller than other giants described in game 1. I’m confusing
Nay, Tyr lost his right hand to Fenri, that ain't being him.
I would beat Kratos in a fight
Coming to PC?
Thor : Avenger's assemble..  Kratos is coming...
Kratos VS Thor?!
И чем эта залупа отличается от прошлой?
Kratos looking like kimbo slice
2:11 Im pretty sure that is an Asgardian soldier that came down by the bifrost. Imagine we get to fight Heimdall
2:16 mcu thor hammer sound?
Hope they keep the woke stuff to a minimum.
I am excited, how they gonna reset your axe and blades design, I mean how they explain it
Gonna be released to PC soon after launch? That's be a smart marketing move. Release to steam & epic after a few months of the game being a PS exclusive.
Downright just waiting for some more Mimir banter
I can't wait for jacksepticeye to play this!!!
It’s a dream to work at Santa Monica studios. 😍
as I remembered Freya has a curse that made it impossible for her to harm any living creature — through either physical or magical means. Also, Odin stripped Freya of her Valkyrie wings and hid them in an unknown location. If Freya is able to attack Kratos, does that mean she recovered those wings just to beat kratos?
this my 40th day of watching this trailer and i cant wait to play this game
3:05 And can someone tell me who this is in norse mythology?
holy moly . santa monica you are amazing
is it available on ps4?
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person *Shows Kratos blowing someone up*
Whens the release dates??
These comments man. "B0i rElEasE dAtE l0kI wiTh h0rNs cAlM aNd rEs0nIlbE pErS0n rElEasE dAtE" my goodness man. I hate people
mimir reading the book cracked me up
I PRAY , that it doesnt take them 4 years to release it on PC.
I can’t wait to show Thor how much of a calm and reasonable person I am 💀😂
Can't wait for the mods, so we can see Goatee Kratos fight Thor.
cant wait for the game
I love how Atreus appears as Loki with this deer on his head
I hope he destroys Freya . She’s the absolute worst
Please release this on pc
"the prophecies say Fimbulwinter leads to Ragnarok." the prophecy: Brokk: "this is Fimbulwinter, I can feel it in my scrot!"
So... litteraly spoiled lika 1/3 of the game
*BOI*
Most of the time I would think the cut scenes always look better the the gameplay... Nope not for GoW its the same...
Ok.. Now i know what i need. A PS5 🤧
I’m too hype!!!! Give us a release date
I beg you sony, don't release this on pc
My boy Tyr need to get laid i meant look at that left arm
looks like a DLC to me
Please release this on PC, I will literally throw you my money if you do.
3:00 I have one, why are you black?     No offense
The last one was worthy of me dedicating hours to get a platinum trophy. This one will also be worth the challenge 😎 I CANT WAIT!
I hope they add more variety of brute enemies (not the repetitive Trolls of different variants) and death animations and a little bit of gore back in this game, GOW lacked in those aspects
Lets hope for more than 3 enemy types this time! Oh and more than 2 execution animations, yeah that'd be sweet.
Will it come out on PS4 too?
No matter how many gods fall there will always be another to stand against you- Posiedon
The soundtrack is amazing, I can't wait to play this game
I still find it funny that some people were arguing that Kratos is Tyr😂🤣 it was so dumb and reaching
Kratos : War is not the only way. Microsoft bought Activision blizzard.
Why was Zendaya in the last part
Boi: "so you'd let me kill you"? Kratos: "if it meant you would live, yes"
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person.Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: L3+R3
Please bring it to play station 4 console pleaseeeee
I hope they release this for PC the same time.
Would love to witness a live orchestra of this. Music composer directed musics and soundtracks very very well. Credits to Bear McCreary and the rest of the band!
Also did anyone else notice the tear marks on Freya?
Dude Atreus hitting puberty is gonna be a quick time event. Answering questions that hopefully don't set him off
Kratos: Are You Coming With Us!?  Tyr: 💪🏽  That Was Legendary💯
Come on Sony please release the game asap
this is the only thing keeping me going
releas the game pls
Kratos is not thinking like a general because he become ghost of sparta because he is a cruel general - For Atreas
When is it coming out
Ok have a feeling at the end Atreus is gonna embody his true name and turn against kratos
Can’t wait
Let's hope it will be released on Pc sooner than ever finger crossed everyone..
Im buying ps5 for this ( iam a PC fan )
from Boat Gameplay to Sled Gameplay
bruh when they were in the town I was getting such big witcher 3 vibes
Will it be on ps4
Sekyro 2? 🙄👌
I hope their aren't any glitches in this one, gow4 had a major bug at the very end of the game
"War is not the only way" Kratos said calmly.
this music and sounds gives me gooshbumps everytime i heard
Pandora is the real reason why Kratos had a character development
Can we just reboot the series again without an annoying child sidekick?
plz give this game for ps4
Oh sweet! I can't wait for the PC port in two-three years!
this game will be in ps4??
Is Brok's voice actor changed?
pog
The Mural at the end of GoW must be Tyr?
Can’t wait to play
The Best Game
Last girl is angrboda?
I can’t believe people are actually hyped at the same game
me when I see boy: "Im still taller than this kid  Atreus: Im a giant how are u taller than Me?
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start acting like a general  ///////////////////////////////////////////// Kratos Greek Flashbacks
Probably watched this trailer about 100x.. and will probably watch it another 100 more..lol If and when Kratos knocks the fat off of Thor.. I truly hope Santa Monica gives us the glory and ability to wield Mjonir and Leviathan at the SAME TIME.  That mechanic alone would make this the game of the f’ing decade!! A man can dream right?!
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Me: I’m not that guy pal
I'm sorry, guys! The line ends here for Thor. B)
Game of the year, I'm calling it
Imagine the girl at the end of trailer was Kratos wife and Atreus mother
Love that Nordic tune playing in the background
Its me :D
No ps4?
Ps5
Will the Norse gods ever figure out that Kratos is the cursed and powerful demigod who brought down Olympus Its self and not stupidly think he is a giant ( well I retract that last bit because he is the grandson of Kronos ) . I want Odin to Be  nervous when he finds out :)
please, PLEASE tell me it'll come to PC too!
Is it coming to ps4
So... On PC by around 2026?
Many many
When they gave up on even giving a date because it keeps getting delayed
Please drop this on PC
Upgrading those weapons are gonna be such a pain bruh
Hope the OG GOW music will show up
La maldita cretaaaaaa
I had a nightmare last night.  This was being adapted into a movie…with tom holland playing Kratos 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
“Are you coming with us?” “No” *credits roll*
Beautiful can't wait to play ❤️
just finished playing the Gow on pc. please release this on pc as well🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is gonna win game of the year again 🔥
Who’s excited for ragnarok!!
my brain just went POP
1:34 Heyyyy whoa clipping! In the game trailer! A mistake so honest, I kinda like that they kept it in.
👍🏼
So excited for this!! Previous game was an absolute master piece ☺️🌟
Well I’m gonna think like a general when I’m beating each one of them.
WOW
Fill me up daddy Kratos
2:52 size means nothing to Kratos ask Hercules and Zeus plus all the other gods
Raising a going through puberty as a single father... Kratos' hardest battle yet.
Look at all these PC master losers polluting our community with their port begging. Sad.
Pleease daddy take my money
Only ps?
Im really wondering did Kratos fix that hole in his roof from the previous installment……
Cannot wait for this game
blacks in norse mythology?
I am sooo looking forward to whatever it is that makes kratos snap for game 3 in which I’m guessing like the old gow 3 you’ll do horrible things to the pantheon
I prefer if this game didn't come out this year I wish they would take their time
i cant wait to see kratos bring down an entire mythology again
is Ragnarok coming to pc?
Are you a calm and reasonable person ? 🙌
just bring back cyclops riding ;_;
Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!  Kratos on the outside: NO! 😡 😡 😡  Kratos on the inside: NO! 😳 😳 😳
Just tell us the release date already so we can get even more impatient about the game
Give it to PC! Bless you.
Questions I want to know is how freya can attack Kratos if Odin put a curse on her that prevents her from hurting any person? Also the ring they got with the dwarf soul what goes on with that? When ragnarok does come it’s foretold Odin and Thor fight a flame giant with a flame sword? The crow thing in hel? Can’t wait to see some of these questions answered in the next game.
zendaya is everywhere these days
Once Kratos is done killing Norse Gods, it will be up to "BOY!" to look for other pantheons to mess with
You must release On the Best platform. PC
Doesn't Thor sound like Josh Brolin? Imagine how awesome that would be!
Hands down best game that isn't multi-player, and even better than most at multi-player
No thanks
Je s'en que Kratos vas mourir et sont fils prendra le relais du jeux 🙏🏽⚡
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start acting like a general!"   Kratos then proceeds to murder all the Norse deities. Play time will be 2 hours. Thank you all.
Will it be available on PS4
I wonder what other pantheon they'll include here or do next. Here's to hoping for the Egyptian pantheon!! XD
I hope and pray this comes to pc
skyrim but if it was 1000000000x better
10-1, Kratos takes Mjölnir to compete the obligatory lightning, fire, and ice trifecta
I can just hear kratos saying Ragnarok is coming ready yourself boy
as if atreus wasn't annoying enough, now he's a teenager
Looks incredible, not sure how I missed this trailer.
Kratos in greek : ZOOS, i bring the destruction of olympus!  Kratos in Norway : boi if i hear one more thing about war and violence imma slap you back to your mother
Love Kratos’s new outfit.
I beg this also comes out on pc, after playing gow4 recently I'm absolutely hooked. Never experienced a game like it. Please let us pc gamers in on the action
Oo I can’t wait to fight freya
be kool if he shaved his beard lowkey . either way its still fire
<<We are the gods we chose to be>>
Imagine Chris Hemsworth playing gow and ultimately killing thor and Odin 😶‍🌫️
I’m sure the game goes into explaining why their is a young, black child in Scandinavia. Don’t even worry about it. It’ll all make sense
I am so ready! Can't wait!
Aaaaand they just had to be "woke", they just fkn had to be fkn woke. Trash company
Just 100%  GoW (2018) on PC, I had my doubts from gameplay I had seen, but actually playing it is much better. Far from perfect, but looking forward to Ragnarok although I imagine that will be at least a year after the PS release if not more.
Well, is it me or the sound of Mimir is like Major Campbell of Peaky Blinders?
is this a dlc or new game?
Odin is going to slaughter kratos right in front of atreus's eyes and Atreus will unleash ragnarok in pure rage and destroy the world. My prediction.
Atreus: We're trying to stop ragnarok.  Says the kid who releases fenrir and unleashes ragnarok in his later life.
THOR- "someone is in our town" ODIN- "who?" THOR- "his name is KRATOS" ODIN- "pack your bag son we are leaving"
Does anyone know what happend to Atreus’s voice
Aysher
What puzzles me the most is that a lot of places and characters are out of time. If Loki and his to be wife Angrboda are kids, how the World Serpent (their son) is alive?
Boi: 'what if this means war?' Kratos: 'you merely adapted the war. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see Peace until I was already a man'
Ragnarok: boy enters puberty
I WILL PLAY THAT GAME
how hope we can transfer our save kratos from 2018 game to the new one
Reminds of the Vikings
"Stop thinking like a father, Think like a general.!" Kratos who destroyed a whole fooking mythology by just being a general.
OMAGAWD TYR IS SOOOOO TALL
2:54  Hercules vs Kratos Flashbacks
If kratos was thinking as a general young boy would have been thrown out amidst draugr as a kid with only underwear to cover himself up as every spartan boy has done
tyr is gonna betray them 100%
Quite head!
Let's hope for a straight to PC launch
Xbox players gonna play this on YouTube 🤣
The foreshadowing of loki's appearance with the horns of the deer he brings in the intro gave me goosebumps
GOTY already. I am extremely puzzled by the dislikes
I dont know, its just me or what, but the boy just like an adult who stucked in the tiny body. Coz his voice just like an old man
1:57 This gives me genuine chills.
I can't wait 😆😆😆
You seem like a calm and a reasonable person......    Yeah sure , such a nice guy, he is the calmest guy
who is the girl at 3:05
i watch this at least once a week. i just want to play this movie already
same hype as GOW2 back then in 2006
Shout out to all the artists who worked or are working at Santa Monica Studios.
the belt of chaos is confirmed in ragnarok
Kratos: ARES DISCIPLINE THIS CHILD AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!!
let's bring this masterpiece to PC
hopefully i dont have to wait 3 years for it to come to pc like the last one
I think this game is going to be more popular
I don't know HOW I DIDNT SEE THIS FIRE TRAILER!
Oh wait I know that hammer it..... it's Jonathan
The Boy's haircut doesn't fit the era.
Goty of War Ragnarok
Can we please get rid of the little kid thing.
Just finished the game on PC what an experience it was can't wait for Ragnarok
Откуда негры?
Since atreus is a teen he's prolly gonna be feeling a little weird once he's around angrboda. 😏
My thoughts.  So if loki is thorst brother then lokis father in norse mytholygy is kratos then what about thor is his father odin or kratos. Tyr will play in a oart where we might fight thor
0.57 welcome to new asgard on 🌎
I hope this game is twice as long as the last one. GoW4 didnt feel that long.
Who's the little girl at the end?
Thor: you seem like a calm and a reasonable person  Kratos : Wouldn't you like to know Avenger
Hope this available at ps4☹️
0:52 Is that freya?
Is it just me or this trailer spoiled too much? The last game was fenomenal because everything was a mystery, but doesn't this trailer just gave away everything?
If this is the finale to the Norse Mythology run, I really hope the next games go into the Egyptian Mythology.  I want to see Kratos and his son take on Egyptian gods!
Now this is hype
Boy isn't Boy anymore. He is now SON.
I waiting for kratos do crossover in egypt, indian, and japan mythology
Is this also for ps4?
You can buy activision but you’ll never be able to create a game like this Xbox 😊
The game is only for ps5 or  and  PS4  pro !!!
I've found my brothers amongst mortals. I'll be with you all in Ragnarök
Sad its not going to release on pc
Who is from Russia
beautiful
Is that that Arrdee as the child? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks absolutely amazing!! Been waiting on a sequel since I beat GoW 4 lol
There's no way Tyr isn't found halfway through the game. Why else spoil a huge scene like that?
Indra… I mean Thor vs Kratos 😎
When does it release cause I heard April?
Can we take a moment and acknowledge the fact tyr is looking down at Kartor
Normally that intense music kicks in when we see Kratos, but this time it kicks in when we see his son. I think that says a lot about what Atreus is capable of
Finding out who he is.  About who "Loki" is.   Doesn't it sound like he knows who Loki is and he wants to know who he is as the entity named Loki?
excited to see how much atreas has grown and what new powers he might develop, hoping for something more than just animal summons
As a xbox player im very excited
I hope that when you beat Thor, Kratos can lift Mjolnir and can be a new weapon in game.
I can’t WAIT
I'll not allow you to pick a fight. Says the guy who started all these.
Modi looks like Thor lol , mmmm
I am so excited for the Gods of war collab of the ghost of sparta and tyr
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person" 😭😭😭
Imagine if they bring back the beeg sword
RELEASE DATE PLEASE!!!! I CANT WAIT
Thor...you've no idea what you gotten yourself into...
i probably watched this trailer more than a hundred time , don't know why
Boy.
It better come out on PS4 as well
Atreus is gonna get a girlfriend!
From the looks of it I think or well I have a hunch that loki or atreus will fall in love with that girl in the end... and its a suprise that tyr was alive!
Why would they spoil that you actually find tyr? Why do I watch trailers? What is the meaning of life?
Atreus then:  Stop thinking like a general and start thinking like a father Atreus now: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general
Kratos: I will not allow you to pick a fight with gods Atreus: I don't wanna fight anyone but I will
And ofc a black girl in norse mythology
The Ghost of Sparta is death.  We go where we please boy.
I hope they include the part where loki becomes the mother of a horse
please make PC VERSION ;.;
I noticed in the trailer the visuals of the leviathan axe and blades of chaos returning to level 1 which makes sense. Other than that it looks like stance switching combos will be back but we are getting new moves.
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  Well no but actually, no
Feels like a pure CINEMA!
Just finished playing GOW on my PC. So much HYPED for Ragnarok!
ARTEUS GET GIRLFRIEND??
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  Well yes but actually, no
why is Loki's wife's black? I mean I get it that the studio doesn't wanna be racist but it's the Norse....
Needs more somalians.
what happened to odin's curse saying freya is not allowed to fight or defend herself?
Indo sendiri awokawokawokawok
2:53 a bodybuilder meets a strongman
well someone hit puberty :D
Bien parece que van a aver puzzles igual de difíciles xd
WHO ARE YOU
So pumped
Is it going to be on PS4 or just ps5
Words can’t describe how excited I am for this game……
After Greek gods kratos is after norse gods
im so hyped for this!!!!
The lore really excites me because even though ragnarok is the end of the age of gods it is the beginning of the age of men with no gods to rule or oppress them
Looks like an expansion, instead of a new game
Apparently kratos is *calm*
Straight up, this legit could be used as the launch trailer
Wow that voice actor for that kid is annoying and cliche
Idk but I’m not a fan of Atreus’ voice
Just finished the game on PC. Man this trailer got me all hyped up.
Can’t wait
I hope they don't wait too long for a pc release
It's been 4 months since this trailer came out and I'm now just seeing it. Bruh I'm so hyped
11 million views 🤘🏻 amazing for a Trailer 8 days later 12 million 1 month later 13 million
My dad: it's not time to play G.O.W come and eat  Me: nope  My dad: well where's my belt of chaos  My mom:😊
Really tryna think if I wanna prepare myself to play this one, the last one was crazy asf, very puzzling it drove my mind like crazy
I cannot wait to battle Thor in Ragnarok, he sounds and probably is like a rival to Kratos.
I still cant believe people really complained about a reused boat animation
I wonder if they are gonna give an explanation about how we lost all those upgrades in our equipments
I CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS ON PC :DDD
day 1 purchase, no question asked.
I wish they hinted at the fact that Tyr is alive in the previous game, I like the idea but it's just really random. This reveal would've felt much more satisfying if people started making theories and stuff.
The blades of chaos looks alot more like the original now
I hope to see Fey this time. She seems like a calm and reasonable character
For real Play Station has NO LIMITS !!!! Congrats for a new MASTERPICE !!!!
Hello Ryan Hurst
Is it true that "war is the only way" ?  Heh, look who just said that
I just finished the GoW on PC and I really REALLY hope this wonderful sequel comes to PC soon O_O
Can't wait to play this in like 2-3 years when the PS5 will finally become available ^^
Wait, so Tyr actually alive? Oh well, I probably missed it
So its not coming to pc ? :(
Do we have to wait another 3 years for the PC version?
the slayer of gods s back babyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Great now I have to wait another 4 years to play it on pc…
AHHH SO CLOSE
War is not the only way ... Kratos ...quotes...
I wish they'd release some info.
Just tell me who in the Helheim blew the horn!!!???
Ps5 only?
Please tell me we don't spend much more time at the Lake of Nine :(
Oh man the dog sled looks like it'll be a fun replacement (at least on midgard it looks like) to the boat
Can’t wait to get Thor’s hammer.
best game of all time
Woke trash
OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, I’m so excited bro
Please make the game available on pc at the release
I don't understand,this trailer remember the chapter 4 but,this time is not baldur but is thor whit freya,and they did not add somme wepon? like the blade of Olympus or special ability like medusa head...
Mmm, more orange juice.
Did anyone notice Zeus at the end 🤔
When 100 years goes by this game will be legendary  to your Youth of 2122
Woww this looks amazing
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Also Thor: Why do I see 2 flaming circles??
Atreus became ugly, crazy and boring as 90% of teenagers. Is bosnian Sunny Suljić still lending a voice? Btw we need this one on PC as well.
yep it wont run on my pc i have an i5 4690 with gtx 960 4gb 16gb ram
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please let crash on xbox
After seeing the success on pc, they need to give it us day 1!!!!!
see ya in 2025 pc players xD
Is this coming out for PS4 as well?
can't wait to play this on PC in 2030 XD
go
I can’t wait to kill Thor and use his hammer!
Either the Dwarves made Tyr a new arm or I guess Fenrir isn't bound just yet? Why he still habs both his arms!?
didn’t even care about the price when it came out now to pc platform….thank you santa monica for letting pc gamers also join to this epic journey!
So, Freya’s curse of not being able to attack or fight back was broken…
would've been better with ancient english and viking accent
Seems like 30m copies easily sellout
At 1:34 the The ax getting into  the swords, please make sure there are no mistakes at all and take your time
I like when the head was painting
"Start acting like a general" last time kratos did that he deleted a whole mythology
Bu trailer'dan anlaşılıyor ki, Mimir'e ya veda edilecek. Yada Mimir'e başka göz takılıp, Tyr'a kendi gözleri verilecek. Başka bi açıklaması olursa da, süpriz olur hani.
Plz, bring to PC too *.*
Please be on pc !
Yea I'm getting a PS5.
Hurrray for race swapping characters from the literal whitest religion on the planet.
2:53 Tyler1 meme incoming
Loki this is gonna be the top tyr game
Just only ps5?
most of the weapons usage here was of the blades of chaos and it also got new moves
Freya you dingus Kratos saved you!!!!!!!
How have i not seen this trailer? Cant freaking wait to play 😭
Спросите у Фила Спенсера он возродит primal rage место теккена как динозавровый мортал комбат для детей
Will be epic no doubt
Фил спенсер хочет помоч семью плейустейшон плане Джека и декстера
Can we just appreciate the scorpion double chain brutality Kratos just tried to do? 2:04
hope they will make PC version later
What if Tyr is away they add Co-op
Kratos to Freya: Did u knw what i did with Sigrun?? Now stand down!
He sounds like he’s 15 but looks like he’s 10
why does Thor sound like a generic Bond villian
Tyr should be missing a hand
Thor: you seem like a claim and reasonable person kratos: take a seat Thor I’m going to give you a history lesson
that looks BADASS !
Take my money please
I’ve watched the trailer so many times but I just noticed that kratos at 1:57 isn’t carrying the blades of chaos, I wonder why?
Just dislike because they could show Tyr without saying his name
Trying to stop Ragnarök causes Ragnarök.
Keep watching this trailer because I can’t wait for ragnarok. Who else like this ? Hahahaha
this seems like a calm and reasonable game
Are You Coming With Us ......!
Meanwhile……                 GTA 6= 💀💀💀
I'm so glad they take their time
I guess a little bit that this series will be very but very sad :/
Kratos: “Who are you?!” Thor: “They called me….Point-breaker”
Sony RIP
Please bring this to PC
Never thought that "The adventures of Tintin" could go this far.
I played the game on PC and all i can say is  the game was ambrosial, and now i just watched this trailer and it gave me the goosebumps and on the same time it saddens me that i wont be able to play it. On the other hand i think its time for Kratos to go......................back after this chapter.
4 months later & i’ve probably watched this about more than 100 times.. SANTA MONICA, PLS GIVE US A RELEASE DATE
i hope for a pc version fast
for any one not familiar with norse mythoology at 1:17 you see two ravens flying away, those are more than likely Huginn and Muninn, the two are known for flying around midgard gathering information for Odin...
Atreus sounds like Ekko of League of Legends
I was waiting for killing odin or thor
I hope Kratos and Mimir come across Anansi some day.  The idle banter between Anansi and Mimir will be legendary.
Is it for ps4 too?
Kratos only hard thing to do is to pretending to be weak
So...when PC?
I'm crying tears o joy 😊
anyone know if this will release to pc?
Imagine gow 123 with this gameplay and graphics
Is it me or I’m the only one waiting with no confirmation about the game on its   release date,  I jus wanna play it 😭
Is this going to be on ps4 please tell me it is
if only they had stock for ps5.. play it on pc really love it.. hope this year i able to buy ps5
*Tyr stands up Kratos: I'm I suppose to be intimidated?
Keep the boy away from the horses
АХ*ЕТЬ!!! 😱
The best franchise ever <3
Thor : are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos : L3 + R3
Ah yes! Will this be a PS exclusive now?
I'm just wishing that this game comes out for pc too.
Same axe and chaos blade? No new weapons? A bit disappointed.
is it avaliable on ps4?
2:12 Bifrost landing!
Please! make it on pc!
Literally put tears in my eyes. I’m too ready for this 😩😩😩
That girl is confirmed to be Angraboda. She is the mother of Hel (the goddess not the realm) Fenrir the wolf and of course Jormengaunder the world serpent
Looks amazing.
Так смешно видеть это лицемерие, даже на Ютубе. В топе комментариев ни одного с претензиями на счёт цвета кожи ангрбоды.
anegroboda.......
1:55  Kratos: *PTSD
i think i got a tear in my eye
A much better interpretation of Norse mythology than what the MCU gave us. Ew.
Teen Loki Finds Teen Angrboda
Quando si giochi sono delle opere !!!!! Altro che quelle cagate che escono sul  gamepass!!!! Complimenti a Santa Monica è tutta Sony ❤️❤️❤️siete i migliori !!!!!!!!
A black in a game about Norse mythology?
I am so buying this game
When I see Angrboda, I can only think of one, inevitable moment.  Atreus: "Father... How do I talk to girls?"
"Stop thinking thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"  Kratos: *Bugs bunny meme
Little does Tyr know, that size means nothing to Kratos
Black character in norse mithology alert
I Wish Chris Hemsworth Will Be Voice of Thor.
My 60$ dollars is wating for you
Now I finally understand why Baldur said “I’d thought you’d be bigger”
I have a feeling the ending of this game will be EXTREMELY bittersweet.
time will come when we get to play atreus as the mc.
"What if there was someone who could help us?"  Man, if only Deimos was alive😥 I would have loved to see him and Kratos just go all out on these Norse punks. Plus seeing him as an uncle to Atreus would have been doped!
This game should be on pc too
I love thor's voice
Kratos>Thor
Such a powerful character development amazing.💯
Better than Hollywood movies
does the world look open?like in open world games
They add a black girl to a Nordic mythology themed game. For what? For woke points?
Take my money😱😭
"you'll get you answer soon enough, well some of them"
Atreus really does not know who his father was. Reminds me of my rebellious days.
Wew.. tissue please
Man, hope this comes out on PC the same time it releases on PS5,
i hope this game realeases early and is unfinished like fnaf sb
Kratos went to war with the Greek gods and now it’s time for war with the Norse gods  Zeus was powerful, let’s see what Odin can do
I hope sept 22 is the datr
Týr with all hands ? hmm so thats before Fenrir bite his hand ?
Just hope the rumored september release to be true
Man I keep coming back please drop this already !
I'll buy a PS5 just for this game.
I can’t get over how it sounds like Atreus has a voice effect on
anyone else notice two wolves on that sled cough cough
Man zendaya is everywhere
Just when you thought he wasn’t angsty enough, Atreus going though puberty is going to be Kratos’s greatest battle 😨
"war is not the only way" persuasion check failed
Will this game ever come out lol
Hope the game comes to PC too and not 3 years after release.
Y'all notice how in the beginning of the trailer the kid walks in like there's horns on his head.   Little loki
SMH gotta wait for 3 years for the PC port now. 😭
I sincerely hope this game can reach 4K 60fps but with the scale I’m expecting a choice between graphics and performance modes. Hopefully they can do like Ratchet and Clank rift apart where if you play on a 120hz screen, the graphics mode is increased to 40fps
I would so much love to see this on PC too, the port of the previous was awesome, and i hope they will port it as soon as possible.
TO TELOS ARHIZI
How many war games is that now? Like 7?
Kratos needs a dad bod
MAN, Tyr is Tall, This is absolutely amazing, although i can't play it because i don't have console lol
Man it would be nice if it comes on pc after 7 to 6 years.
this game is reasion to by a ps5
Was that a trailer of a movie lit ❤️‍🔥
Game of the Year 2022! It's one of the Best games ever made in History of Gaming! Take all my Money!!!!!!!!
“This path you walk…vengeance…you will find no peace, i know”
we want that also for PC
Atrerus : "War is Coming" Kratos : HAAAAAA !! Seriously this is really funny 🤣🤣
"you seem like a calm and reasonable person , are you a calm and reasonable person ?" Kratos : Don't know , you tell me...did you see what i did to Olympus tho ?
think like a general
Finally, we had it in 2018, now we're in 2022.
kratos seems to be afraid of Allah's judgment he is all stressed 😂
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing.harness it.let is serve you"  Kratos Character development is on an other level
Atreus has grown a huge d* k     on his face.
It's just a trailer, but the Boy is so annoying here(
I hope kratos and freya can get along together again and make a team with tyr. Kratos, mimir, atreus, freya, and tyr stoping ragnarok
Can't wait till we get a new State of Play for a full gameplay reveal
Please release it on PC aswell
Now I understand why baldur said I thought you'd be bigger Tyr is huge
I hope kratos gets a wider range of weapons in this one
Loki does lead the war against the Aesir… Much like Kratos led the war on Olympus
So are we fighting Odin???
This better be on PC.
The game came For ps4 or not
Why is there a black girl in my ancient European tale?
I’ve watched this at least 30 times and I’m still excited for it. It’s gonna be a great game
Atreus: stop thinking like father and think like a general for once  Kratos: well about that let me show you my track record
2:30 is my favorite part of this trailer
ทุกวันนี้ยังเล่นภาค 4 อยู่เลยเชื่อไหม เล่นไม่เบื่อจริง ๆ เล่นจนรูปหมดว่าของอยู่รูไหน
I can’t wait
Hope it's come to pc too
Can't wait for the eventual PC release!
Well, time to wait another 4 years for this one to get to PC after this releases
Tyr out here looking like he about to start Christianity.
You know, I wonder if they’ll realize that Faye likely put them in the position they’re now in.
I just played through this game last week since it came out on PC, and now I'm sad because I know it'll likely be at least another year and a half before this might release on Steam
PC port please!!! ❤
PC version please <3
I completely forgot about this. Hope the game is more memorable.
Smh they should’ve had somebody else do Atreus’s voice the voices don’t match up 💯🤷🏾‍♂️
Is it just me or should we get another game with Kratos in his prime
Give us waist armor, calf bracers, forearms bracers, to be able to make a build with an upper body without armor. Get rid of those rags of pants Kratos doesn't need that raggedy pity layer on his legs for Pete's sake.
pegi 13?
Hurry up ps5 is waiting
Kratos's death would be the true impetus for ragnarok I think. Kratos is like the last tether holding Atreus to the the world and I think his death would really set the world ablaze. Kinda cool I guess seeing that he's the last surviving person from the Greek pantheon and his death would spell the end of the Norse one.    But I don't know man I'm not a writer for santa monica studios lol
this game has illegally smooth animation and combat
They should do  like a RE2 where you get to play from Atreus's perspective in disc 2.  Lol
All hail Santa Monica
I mean, angraboda is African now?
I just like mimir
want to sell it on pc
I can only imagine poor Cory Barlog trying to handle his anxiety with this one. I'm sure they'll do great.
i love how this game become killing gods to raising a teenage boy
Please port it to PC, finally got to play the 2018 game because of it and it was amazing
Release it to pc, you monsters
Nice they are not going to kill kratos with a bat in the beginning of the game
Just finished GoW on PC and I finally understand this trailer. Also black Angrboda makes even less sense considering egyptian mythology exists in the universe.
Sony PC when?
Kratos mahan vyakti ballam vyakti yudh ka bhagwan mahan sab se mahan
I want to see tyr travel worlds, and come to Greece with Kratos, but they would have to time travel cause Greece got destroyed
Tyr; I am coming, brothers…  *Tyr stand up with Kratos and Atreus*
im going to get this game
Waiting for kratos x tyr rule 34 ships
Why haven’t I heard anywhere that this trailer came out? They really didn’t advertise it but I’m so glad I searched it on my own and found this amazing trailer 🙌🏼
wonder what a movie of this game would be  like!
Looks awesome, but nowhere near next gen
We ll get more "boy" I guess
will it come to windows? please launch there!!
This looks amazing. I'm definitely interested.
I wasn't gonna play GOW tonight 'cause it's late but this hyped me up again. Fxck it
soon
I got myself a gyro in one hand and a bowl of Greek yogurt in the other.  I'm ready...
Freya vs kratos I can’t wait and the end the girl looks so familiar
Common mith tells Thor is the protector of humanity... I hope they use this to dig out what Kratos did in GoW 1-3 to make them enemies, and in the prosses Atreus gets to know the past of his father.
Q JOGO BOM
so i will need to wait for this one for 4 years to go on pc like the last one 😅
OK OK I ADMIT... KRATOS IS NOT TYR.
I see thor
So we need to wait another 10years for PC release
This year Boyz.    "We must prepare ourselves"
mid
Is this game gonna have its own version of the "Make Love not War" message?
Can't wait for the Atreus sequel: *SON OF WAR*
Frog dudes are way too cute - i know its just youtube comment, but would alot cooler if they were more mean :)
Lama kali lah kapan rilisnya
Please be on PC also !!! PLEASEEEEE
Mimir: taller than kratos     Kratos: 8 ft tall     Edit: i thought mimirs head was put on tyr
Start thinking like a general . Oh boii you don't want that
Cool trailer But what's with the token black girl at the end and why does she sound also asian? was there point to showing that? I'm starting to feel like sony feels like including black people everywhere as if rewards pop out if they do. Side effects of spiderman becoming extremely successful I guess.
will this game be available on ps4?
it looks like a ps4 game lol.
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general   Kratos: Hitler flashback
Yoo playstation, dont forget your PC gamers, we got GoW... now we need Ragnarok aswell😉
krtos😗
The visual of arteus carrying the deer at the start looks like loki horns when his got the black figure 👌🏼👌🏼
Okaay so Thanos is playing Thor now? coolcoolcool
Amazing !!! I can’t wait any longer for the game to come out!!!
consider my money on this
Я жду игру
I love that you can actually tell that Thor, Tyr and Baldur are brothers.
this game is gonna be hard to play as Arteus goes through his puberty.
KRATOS IS A GURU.
Love the loki foreshadowing, and frigs  surprise attack is all excellent.  With the re inclusion of Greek monsters aswel we will likely see more familure faces of kratos past. Most importantly given how the last game went we will likely see some of the victims of kratos vengeance. And he will be forced to face them and tell atraues what he did.
A DI ĐÀ PHẬT A DI ĐÀ PHẬT NAM MÔ QUÁN THẾ ÂM BỒ TÁT.,,,,
Man something I love about this trailer is that Atreus is not only more confident but he challenges Kratos verbally. Something thay would not have happened in GoW 2018.
Hello there loki
Only for me Atreus voice sound like Tom Holland's voice?
I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HOPE that this time we'll get to go to Asgard :)D
Annoying kid ruining the game again...
Im happy this Game comes out but im mad aswell because i know i wont be able to play it because i only play on Pc i dont like Consolle ^^ i wish they would start to release those Games at the same Time on Pc,Ps5,Xbox what ever just on all Devices i dont get it they would sell so much i mean the Pc Market is the biggest Market in the World right now..
Bought a PS4 Pro just for GOW, Now gonna have to buy a PS5 just for GOW again 😂
I love the consistency they put. They never confirmed that in this myth that Jormungandr is Loki's offspring since Atreus is still a kid but they also hinted that Jormungandr is from the future which means that it might still be Loki's child.
Can't wait to avoid this like the plague until it comes out on PC 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
That voice acting for the boy scks
The boi returns 😂😂😂😂 soo much  boi
For someone who is not a giant, Tyr is built like one.
this should be DLC and not a full price game
Please bring it to PC too please please PLEASE
I wonder if we will get another weapon to use
I hope this game drops on PC soon after the PS5 release
Is this a DLC or a new game
Old mechanics they finally brought it back
Kurwy macie to wydać na pc bo wass dojade z ekipą i nie bedzie śmieszkowania czy sie rozumiemy?
if this isnt on pc ill kms
Udh 2022 belum rilis juga anjjenng
the real question  pc release when?
He did saved the Greek from Persephone. I wonder how he stop the Raganarok now
Way to tokenize.
Atreus comes in with some deer* Kratos :Your late Atreus:sorry hard to find that shiny head of yours with this blizzard
need this on pc asap take all my money sony
Kartos: A true Warrior does not hide Poseidon!  Also Kratos: Hide in Woods
As it was shown in the film thor ragnarok surtur destroyed asgard so i do believe that kratos is the ragnarok for the asgard so he,ll destroy it and kill everyone
Take my focking MONEY
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: "And I took that personally!"
3:05 well that is the mother of the world serpent
waaaait Tyr vs Fenrir didn't happen yet omgomg LET'S GOOO
Atreus is so manipulative lol always using his mother to get what he wants
Only thing I didn’t like was spoiling that he was still alive.
Why do I feel Kratos "IS" the...their ragnarok
Calliope
We don't need aterus.
pc release date i hope soon enough
This series went downhill really fast
I love how Atreus is smiling when he meets Brok again, such a wholesome moment.
Thor "You seem like a calm and reasonable person " Fandom "hahaha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha "
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?"   Immediately cuts to Kratos beating the life out of multiple monsters.
Here after playing GOW on pc.. Now i understand the hype :D
Is just me or is the axe and blades no longer upgraded in the trailer. All of a sudden they went from beautiful and shiny to their old rundown selves.
Will this be in ps4
I really wants to play it on pc 🤩
Tyr has both hands fenrir confirmed
Kinda surprised they showed us tyr already. Kinda would've preferred to find that out in game.
Tyr still got his arm.  Not for long....
Gaming
Really Frikin cool man
You dropped this: ö
I'd love this to be co op
Looking forward to play this on PC! 😍
Will it also come to PC fingers crossed 🤞
Who is coming here after GOW  Released on PC , what A masterpiece 🔥🔥
Is this a DLC?
So uhhh... this game gonna be ported to PC right away or am I going to have to wait 4 years like the last one?
Those lvl 1 Axe and Baldes though...
the kid sounds even more annoying this go round lol
Ok Ok.... when on PC ...
That BWOOOOOOOOONG
I dont have a playstation for play this :(
Atreus: to stop Ragnarok Not knowing he is loki, the one who brings Ragnarok
This will be ending of Nordic arc for Kratos right??
😅. I can wait 2 years after it releases to play on pc
Oh man I cant wait 3+ years to play this on pc! :D
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person.”  How about you ask around Greece? I’m sure someone there will tell you just how calm and reasonable Kratos is.
wish ps5 was in stock here in PH :(
So it’s the same game, dlc expansion
Can't wait for this to never come to pc till 4 years later
To not dickride the devs, so we have the same weapons and the same abilities from last game. Please don’t let this be as mid as the last game.
Literal chills.
everyone talking about the game im thinking about what the rage name be for it Viking rage
why black women in scandinavian mythology ??
fanTASTIC bush placement. my SALUTATIONS to the developers!!!
please realese this for pc
started playing gow 2018 on pc yesterday, has been a blast... but sad tgat we have to wait a couple of years to get ragnarok on PC when it arrives on PlayStation :(
So the kid is gonna have an even more annoying attitude and probably a cliché teenage romance ? Oh no...
Aynı oyun sadece sonuna ragnarok yazmışlar ulan bari çocuğu büyütseydiniz bari
Me: When will it come out on PC? Sony: 3:01
Hope this one gets ported to pc faster than after 4 years. Because this ps5 recording looks worse than my cheap pc gameplay.
I would love to see another IP from the studio. They have been so dedicated to one game but I can imagine them exploring other cultures and myths with new characters. Hope to see that happen. GOW series is probably one of the best game IP and I hope we see new and different things from them.
Just finished the pc port and now my heart is racing (more, coz it did already while playing) after watching this. I mean, idk <3
i just notice that unlike forbidden west or any other PS exclusive there is no only on PlayStation or exclusive to PlayStation card anywhere in the trailer. so hopefully it is also coming to PC
Already GOTY + maybe coming to PC ?
Lol halo infinite is way better than this
That's all great and all but when is it coming out Santa Monica? You've had 4 years and 1 of them you were home all year. I got my PS5 let's go already!!!
kratos off to destroy another realm of gods again
Really loving kratos’s new gear, the fur cape is nice.
Ummm i need pc version.
So we have interracial viking now
Why isnt Tyr's hand missing???
Thor : Father i kidnapped his son, he will surrender now. Odin: You idiot, last time something happened to his family the whole greek pantheons were wiped out of existence.
Kratos has a  lot of series , he just lives forever bc that's the best thing
Luckily kratos has new skills such as the old version
Mauro canepa true his toughest challenge is raising a teen
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and think like a general".  *New weapon unlocked: THE BELT OF CHAOS*  EDIT: The belt is a parenting tool to punish the bad behaviour of your son, The belt of chaos consist on a belt with sandals adjusted on the end of each belt.
I just want more npcs, more unique sidequests, more weapons
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!" Yeah, struck a nerve there bud.
They better port this to pc quick
2:50 Dajjal
How is he not cold
Wow
“I’d thought you be taller”
BatChest
And when is this lovely Disney Pixar movie coming out? Looks very exciting and wholesome, I will bring my wife and daughters to watch it with me
Atreus!? Never heard that name in my life. who is he anyways?
so another epic videogame that promotes hatred towards fathers and worship women?
Thor is fat
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "You should ask my father"
Who is that man who stands up at the end please :)
release it on pc !
I love the fact that in basically all gow games kratos faces enemies who tower over him yet he has no fear as he stares up at them no matter how big or how scary
They are trying to stop regnarock but why i feel like Kratos is the one about to bring regnarock 😆
3:06 Step sis
🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊Can I get the game already
every time in watch it tyr looks bigger every time he's bigger
Can't wait to beat this game once then never play it again.
tbh I might consider buying a ps4/5 for this game, cannot wait 4 years for a PC version :(
Why there must be people of color in each game now?
please release for pc as well
Ok, how long do I need to wait before it on PC?
Will I get the answer as to why there's a black person in Norse Mythology?
I can't wait to play this on PC in 2058
Peep how in the beginning atreus is holding the deer and it looks like he has a horn helmet… now who wears a horn helmet in norse mythology
Wait, i thought tyr lost his hand
This is a game based on Norse mytholog ffs, why did they feel the need to have a black character? If they really cared about black representation, why didn't they make a game based on african mythology?
TYR !
"Are you a calm and resonable person?" Well... he tries to be.
ah yes, the indigenous blacks of norway
Kratos: boy
i am hoping that use pc players get this too.
i really like Freya but sad she's agaisnt kratos now
I hope it reaches pc soon after it's release
Who was that girl at the end
I cant wait, watching this trailer every week 😳
Didn't Odin cursed Freya to not use spell or blade against a living creature. How she attacking now?
Stop thinking like father  for a moment think a general   Press O repeatedly
its a shame this masterpiece won't be launching on pc despite the world is suffering from ps5 shortage oh well sony being sony what's new....
please release on pc too
Boy of war
Why is angrboda a monkey
Sus
hopefully this comes to Pc like the last one.
This on PC is going to be dope affff
I just notice but why did Kratos axe revert back to its original form?
Kratos: I will have my revenge.........again
Please note that this game actually take 2 REAL LIFE YEARS
impressive
They bought that hot evil norse goddess chick, the talking head and the 2 blacksmith bros back??!....Sold....
Thankyou Santa Monica ♥️
I hope they don’t kill kratos and hopefully change his fate
After the Greek gods death, Kratos became Calm and Reasonable 😜
🔥😭🙏⏰😂👼🔥
They just always deliver. No matter what. They always deliver. Santa Monica Studios is a titan in the video game industry.
0:21 seeing loki with his horned helmet such great visual play. This game is going to be incredible
Cant wait to use my Spartan calm and blades of harmony
yooo is that zendaya
plese release for PC tooooooooo
Since Sony betrayed and fooled all its core players, we'll stop buying any new games on PS5 but wait for its PC port to be released instead. If PC version is much cheaper, why wasting money to buy it on PS5??
I will not make the mistake of playing on GMGOW again....
heavy mcu references,2:12 is the bifrost entrance and at 3:04 i guess thats valkaryie
this on pc one year (or less) later please :c
Saudades do Garoto
I just realised Atreus dosent show up for most of this
WHERE CAN I PREORDER THIS
those horns when atreus walks in
Please come to pc too BOY! ❤️
A train is right.   We don't want Bruce Banner, we want to see the Hulk
Will this be exclusive for ps4?
FREYA... So typically an ex wife behaviour.
منتظرين بفارغ الصبر....
PLEASE MAKE MORE R3 EXECUTION ANIMATIONS AND MAKE ANYTHYING ELSE THAN TROLLS
Чувствую, возможностей раскроют очень много и графика ещё лучше стала
I wonder of QOTs will be back for this game. It was quite fun for those.
i will not buy playstation for this game .. i will wait for it to come in pc  then only i will buy this game
Anyone in 2022 waiting for this to drop? It’s been to long Kratos
Just beat the game on PC,  blood is tasted now can't wait for the Ragnarok.
Judging by the black girl at the end its going to be some what woke lol But kinda knew that
Yes Thor, Kratos is a calm and reasonable man. He calmly and reasonably slaughtered all of the Greek gods one by one.
Thor
I bought a PlayStation 5 yesterday purposely for this game
The big question is..... Is it coming to pc?????
will it come to pc
I wonder if Tyr is going to lose his hand in the game
This game only PS5 👿👿👿👿
Woow,spero esca anche per la ps4
kratos: thunder of love
Все было хорошо пока Санта моника не в уснула отвратительную Повестку, было больно осознавая что осталось мало годных игр. Предетсья закрыть глаза при  встречи черной велеканшей и вообразить в голове настоящую.
There is no part 3. So Kratos is gonna fight Thor and Odin in the same game!
Can’t wait to play on pc
1:57
Kratos will face his toughest challenge
bilisan niyo]
Im from the future… THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
“are you a calm and reasonable person?”  asks that to a man who slaughtered millions with no hesitation because he wanted to kill his father😂  also i love that its coming to PS4 since I just got a Pro
This upgrade reminds me of Horizon: Forbidden West. The same exact expansion of colour and variety, they both look like literal paradises
See this in 0.25X … lol
looking at the design choices of our axe and mjölnir, i am %100 sure that we are gonna have thor's hammer. i am patiently waiting for my "i told you so" moment
I hope they already working on the pc port
Will this one on PC too?
more like Bore Ragnarok
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start acting like a gener- Kratos: *NO*
“NO” kratos said calmly
in the beginning when Loki's carrying the deer, it looks like his helmet when he gets older
2:11 look at those fat hands
this trailer has more views than gow 2018 trailer
of course Scandinavia has immigrants so they should have immigrants gods Greek gods African gods
Kratos is Atreus stepfather.
If Kratos is still as underpowered as he was in GoW it's gonna be annoying. The dude wiped out all Olympian gods and now he's struggling againts a simple mob.
Now we know the answer, why Baldur thought, that Kratos would be bigger
Anyone else re-watching this, trying to spot collectibles?
Hopefully there's more bosses in this one
words can't describe how excited i am for ragnarok to release
Seeing how far kratos has come makes me really appreciate the time they took to create this game (franchise) & basically bring it to reality ❤️
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person." Kratos: *press O* *Insert Rage of Sparta* Thor: "Wait why do I hear boss music?"
I'm just glad Mímir is still in the series. You have to offset the violence with some comedy. Can't wait to hear some of his one liners, lol?
Stop thinking like a father for a movement start thinking like a gentleman :)  I need this type of confidence while showing my result to my father 😂
W8, w8,w88888, was that Odin in the last?!
0:20 Just noticed a silhouette of Atreus that resembles the deer + the music like when the silhouette of Kratos been shown in previous game
The question that bothers me is why people buy Xbox ?, like stop wasting your money  people
Sorry NerdBox fans, but none for you hehehe
No one can defeat kratos
Don't keep us PC players waiting for this games for 4 years after PS5 release. GoW is amazing on PC. Bring Ragnarok sooner.
Please release this on Pc too🤧
For PC gamers , wait for just another 5 years to get the game. 🤣🔥  (I'm a PC gamer as well 😢😞)
wow just wow
playing this on pc ATM! not going to lie is kind of boring ATM ....all the hype from PlayStation users about this game .......will continue and see if it gets better
Please lord, come to PC at a reasonable time and not 3-4 years later. GoW on PC is amazing, we need the entire series. I'd gladly pay and play through every single GoW again, it's been 17 years. Cheers
The only fear that I got is looking at the ending of GOW and then realized the prophercy that would approach to Kratos
Why this man tyr look like an nba prospect
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?" Kratos : *SPARTAN RAGE AVAILABLE*
Still seeing Kratos at 1/4 power. Come on man give us that old man strength
I can’t wait
No
Ahh so even Santa Monica couldn't resist wokeness, as they made Andrboða black. 😔
Release date?
I hope nothing will happen to kratos in this game
MCU Thor: "Ah, a worthy opponent!"  GOW Thor: "He's MINE, and you will not interfere."  Atreus/Loki: "Two Thors?"
Meanwhile I'm looking forward to seeing Jormungandr again...
Pls Playstation, let GoW 4 be in GeForce Now, I have already purchased the Game on Steam and I cant play It Will and too many people are like me aswell, Make our wishes come true once more!!
My *Bøî* is ready
Bøî !
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person.. Are you a calm and reasonable person?” 🥶
2:24 _"In moment of crisis - panik does nothing!"_  Hear that... ...you lemmings out there, who run around with a mask at the beach, when no one else is there?  ...those of you, who drive alone in your car, while wearing a mask?  ...those who shun citical thinking people, because they are not guillable like you are, you who rather want to live in fear?  Pathetic bunch.
Wow
It looks like the combat gameplay is even more fluid. I cant wait any longer
one of the best Game the World have Ever Seen  💥 🌟🌟 💥 _ 🔥
let’s gooo can’t wait
Waiting
Shieeeeee
It was Perfect until 3:05
Calling it right now, that girl is likely Odin in disguise.
Kratos has scorpion’s rope spear now
Well...compared to how he used to be, he is a calm and reasonable person.
My body is ready.
Another singleplayer game ill pick up a couple years after release. Thx beta testers
Time to save 60 dollars 🐦
The boy’s voice is annoying
Seems campy. Naive boy wants to help.  Thinks war can help. Goes to war.  Discovers hes become a monster in the process. Loki found.
hurry up and realse the game loosers
So I looked it up. That girl at the end is Angrboða who, in Norse mythology, is a giantess and the mate of Loki, as well as the mother of  Fenrir, the World Serpent and Hel. So clearly this is going to be Atreus; love interest. That should be interesting to see in the game.
Gotta love that feeling when you can't play a sequel to one of your favourite game franchises  Edit: it's actually coming to ps4 aswell. I can play it after all
Think like a general? Ask his dad's former troops how well it worked out for them longterm lol
We need this game GOW!
its gunna come to pc aswell boissssss
2:50 who is that?
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start acting like a general!"  Funny how the whole GOW fandom thinks that Atreus really did a no-brainer question to one of the ruthless generals in history. HAHAHAHAHA
How long will I wait boy
Pakshet na malupet
Atreus : He's taller than you dad, he's gonna beat you up. Kratos : *_Mind your tongue, Boi!_* anyway, wanna come up with us?
Is that the voice of Thanos "You seemed like a calm and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person ? "
pls coming to pc too
1:53
I more love Kratos when he is angry
You'll get your answers soon enough                                  "Well some of them"
When the game will come so delayed
Kratos gets the power gut and the boy becomes the teen    Great
This coming to ps4 as well :)
Oh boy u get to explore the same world as last time except now its frozen. The creativity is being erased in this world
honesty looks like a DLC, expected better from the visuals
👍
Something great is coming
Now that I realized, Kratos got the Thorfinn treatment
😍😍
Im getting this when it comes out
PC release date ? (Open Beta End Date) 🙂
HOLD ON ANGRBODA LOOKS LIKE ARTEMIS FROM GOW1 please tell me I am not alone here
Marketing of SONY 2020/09 announce the game for 2021 after 7-8 they tell us for what ps console it will be come, after 9/10 months they postponed for 2022 without any specific month, now we are in 2022 we still don't have a release date !!
No release date, no pre order, not even a single glimpse of new features from an already finished game. But when the release of the game comes near they gonna spoil everything again. Like their whole other works. This is not a style of a promotion, this is truly an act of ignorence.
cant wait, bought part 3 a week ago for only 10€ best 10€ i spend this year so far :)
The best game
and tyr face really looks like zeus
waw! the shall began, and i miss younger kratos,  he so powerfull when in gow 3 and ascension episode
When!!
If kratos goes back to thinking like a general I don't think atreus will be alive by then😂😂😂😃😃
💪👑
AC Valhalla vibes.
This why they thought he’d be bigger
Hopefully we get to go to vanahiem and svartalhiem
More than one R3
Big boy
Just imagine GOWR, HFW and ELDN RING competing in the 2022 game awards 😂
This is my idea of a perfect retirement , just let me spend the rest of my life plugged in the Matrix playing all this games and letting AI run all things around the house so I don't ever have to go out again... This aren't Video Games anymore , this are Simulations... I Love them all...
1:44 That movement is even better in GoW Ragnarok 😍
Atreus voice is weird is the same kid doing him?
Glad to see someones still carrying the AAA torch.
I'm calling it. This game will be 2022's game of the year.
I want- I want this in my mouth!!!! 😩
Bro, what if Kratos worthy of Mjolnir?  Edit : nvm, just remembered norse myth. Kratos can yield Mjolnir
Okay so no one was going to tell me that a GoW trailer came out 4 MONTHs ago?!
Imagine Kratos going to fight the Roman Gods. It'd be like fighting a cheaper version of the Greek Gods. Killing Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Mercury. I bet Venus woulf just get banged lol
Guess I'll have to wait 5 years for this to be released on PC
One moment of silence for ps4 players
I was done with these games after part 3
Yooooo, this so hype!!!
An still my questions remain the same UNANSWERED. is it a whole nother game? is it a DLC? WHAT IS IT/WHEN IS IT😡
I never thought it was possible for one to  be aroused by the presentation of playing a game. I have no shame
Thor: Who are you? Are you a reasonable person? Kratos: I wiped out greek Gods because I was going through a phase Gorr: Come here my besto friendo Thor: Sweat intensifies*
Maybe we’ll get to play as loki
0:57 did his shield break ?
Whole game spoiled but still awesome
We're almost there guyz but are the fans ready for Atreus to take over the throne from kratos
Bro i want to see Kratos in a goatee again XD its probably never gonna happen but just imagine he shaves in the game. it will be awesome
fuuuuu
My heart is beating so fast
I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT.
11 million's is coming..
I just noticed in some scenes Kratos doesn't have the blades or the chains on his arms. Maybe he'll start without them like before and get them when he needs them.
Bro we really watched a man kill thousands to kill his family by accident to destroy his world for revenge just to realize none of that was ever worth it to get a new family and lose his wife again and now prevent his son from becoming the same thing he was=story telling at its finest
why does thor in this look arthas in WoW
all i want is to see athena in it
Excellent game. But the question is... How to enjoy what it has to offer? No PS5s anywhere. C'mon sony!
I’ve been watching this everyday since it came out, only 9 more months!
What makes this game series special is that it won the game of the year award in 2018 when games like spiderman, rdr2 etc were released..
In moments of crisis, Panic does nothing, Harness it, Let it serve you
Why does tyr look like Julian from trailer park boys
Release date ?
Huh.
Where did mimir's other eye come from?
May you add a bow when you kill one of the bosses?
As Mirmir was talking about Odin has got tricks up his sleeves at 1:16, two ravens were flying just in front and above them.
I don’t know how Tyr is going to fit in a boat telling us stories like Mimir.
this looks like a $60 dlc bruh. trash
Kratos sounds different
Ax to shield
Ax dismemberment
Climbing freedom
This game looks magnificent already and its not even out yet!!
Introducing the Freya Everywhere system.
The girl from polar express at the end💀
Game of year I predict now
I love the beard kratos grew but I do wonder if the reason why he grew it is to not get flashbacks everytime he sees his reflection in any mirror or water, and I wonder if he will ever loose it to see what the thousand fold stronger kratos looks like now, + the beard kinda fits the nortic vibes,
I hoped that kratos would give his axe to his son and him using his old weapon
We want Ghost of tsushima and Ragnarok on pc
I cant believe I will probably have to play this on PS4
Yeet
Been a long-time GoW fan. Not gonna play it now since there's a N in the game.
BLACK ARNGBROĐA. BLACK ARNGBROĐA.
Who needs this generic garbage!? Where’s Bully 2, scrub!?
I honest to azura cannot wait for this game, I will play it to oblivion
They really needed that little black girl at the end. Otherwise, I would of hated it.
Who is the tall guy with the golden eyes
Best work of art this game is amazing masterpiece
0:20 Loki!
In Norse mythology Loki and angraboda ( the girl in the end ) have three children The world snake Fenrir And hela
To be honest we come here once a month to enjoy the epicness of the trailer.
fantastic
bruh is that zendaya at 3:05
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Why don’t you ask your sons?
This trailer is still beautiful to watch
YES!! FINALLY!! WE GET TL SEE THOR AND ODIN GETS SLICED IN HALF BY KRATOS!! AWESOME!!
New theory at 1:55 Kratos ain't got his blades of chaos so I bet Freya takes them and as both of them are returning home Thor comes so then a bit later Kratos and BOY sneak or fight into Freya's home to obtain his blades once more I only think about this as to make the player all of a sudden lose a useful weapon and now is stuck with the axe for a bit
Stop thinking like a father start thinking like a general
Can Kratos go home & chill out for a bit?
I can't wait to kill Freya
Man I can’t wait to play this on ps5 which I haven’t got it yet
What would happen if..... kratos got his blade of olympus back?
I have no idea how I missed this.
This trailer destroyed all them theories about Tyr being Kratos
I wish a studio would take the reigns of the Jak series and put this level of effort into it (with the blessing of Sony of course ala funding) and would really take it to the next level. That concept art they had for Jak 4 with the cities and stuff would be so awesome. This game already looks great and I don't really have to see anymore.
Do you guys think they will release special editions / deluxe editions for ragnarok ?
Atreus: stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general Kratos: let me remind you why they are called blades of chaos and not harmony
I don't even have a PS and I've watched this 10 times already.
Can we get a freakin release date???
Imagine kratos becoming enrage like the young kratos
How much you wanna bet that the hog you hit and Freya saves is the  asguardian Hymdall or how ever its spelled.
bande de malade
I am waiting this game😆😆
KRATOS!
I’m so pumped up by the wolves, i’m hopeing theyre more part of the game and just not the new “boat”
The graphics doesn't seem improved that much... actually not at all...
CALLIOPE!!!
How he goes your coming with us and still doesn’t break eye contact despite being taller then Kratos . I can’t wait for this game
who is that tall guy at the near ending before the ragnarok logo ?
Santa Monica, keep my hype up, I need gameplay please!
will it be on pc lateri n the future??
😍😍
Angrboda is in this?  I sense a tragic romance in the making...
Will u people please stop saying: "L0vE h0w tHeY sh0w LoKi wiTh hiS h0RnS"😠Cory has said multiple times: *loki doesn't have horns, thor isn't muscler or handsome, and odin doesn't live in a castle* That's marvels version, NOT SANTA MONICA!!!
APELÃO
I can see Kratos' NO becoming an instant meme the moment this game comes out.
PS4 community: TAKE MY MONEY!!!
I love the trailer butikker why does boys face look so weird yes i'm calling him Boy
The moment this game is released I’m getting it
since this is gonna be the last game in Norse mythology, the next game should be IRISH MYTHOLOGY
when was this out, i missed it bruh
Faye: Let the rage of the Giants fuel your blades, Kratos.
In this day and age you have to expect that the now black Angrboða will belittle and rebuke Kratos just because  "straight white male BAD!!" and "diverse female non-hetero THE BEST"
This the only game I would allow them to keep the same mechanism as the last game
boy
wow we got a Zendaya cameo at the end
Not gonna lie, the way Kratos eyed Tyr the whole time was pretty sick. Kratos new that Tyr was either gonna join him, or the rest of the Gods.
finally for the equality one black person!
This trailer alone will put hair on your chest
Kratos is obviously a calm and reasonable person. Prove me wrong
T Y R
I'm going to enjoy killing thor just like zeus
Can't wait for the spartan rage reveal in this
its amazing
its coming out to ps4 too?
This game is going to be everything I ever wanted for sequel which I can hardly wait.
I think it would be really cool if they added a new feature to some if not all abilities wherein if you have max immolation or permafrost your abilities are upgraded temporarily making it more worthwhile to not open up with you abilities but use them during a combo.
I am getting this right when it comes out
imagine if Kratos came across Dante from the Dante inferno game
I'm surprised I never played the 2018 GoW until just recently. I was missing out for SO long. Almost done with it and I'm a little sad, haha.
Game of the year already.
assim que o ateus começar a ver doq o pai dele é capaz, e começar a descobrir quem ele é, vai começar a repensar o modo de ver a guerra e querer ela, por enquanto ta só a flor da pele, vivendo no "eu quero matar"
Nice
man these graphics tho👀
The last. GOW I played was GOW 3 and I think kratos voice has changed 🤔
please put this game on playstaion 4 😭
What a beautiful game
its written age restricted😭
Something bad is going to happen to Mimir, I can feel it.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
LETSSS GOOOOO!📯⚡️🪓
I will keep watching this trailer until the game is released
10 million views
Is he fighting Thor ?
Game of the year, right here
🔥
This game will be unmatched for the next 10 years.....
почему опять негры в играх?
Okay, it’s 2022, now where is my game? xD
the kid is still whining :|
This is going to be EPIC!!!
Next will be GOW Spiderman, this game is getting pansier
Lanjutan filmnya kah kren
I just love Mimir
Can we please get a new trailer or update please 😩
Just shut up and take my money already!!!!
COME TO PC PLS!
There’s no way in hel that this game won’t be better than the masterpiece that was GOW 2018
this is gonna be amazing!
I’m so happy that mimir is still with us
What’s next Odin being Asian
whe the game launches
Gow is the goat
I would've thought tyrs hand would be missing ... Or is this before Fenrir bites it off ??
hmm
Looking forward to Mimirs new boat ride stories
That giant fight between Aries and Kratos needs to be rehashed and then upcoming got a war game there’s nothing better than fighting in that giant form that’s what gave the game that extra oomph.
Thor: "Are you a calm and a reasonable person?”  R3 + L3  Me: You tell me.
Who is the guy at the end ?
PS4? No?😭
How many gods are going to start a beef with boi and dad and get an axe to the head
Dude i cant wait
I think we have Skoll and Hati there in Chariot  !!!
dose enyy one know if the game only gonna come ouy on ps5 or if it gonna come to ps4 also
Boy boy boy boy BOY, I NEED MORE BOY!
is thor thanos ???
Why is this in my recommended, if it’s 3 months old? I still love it tho
We need The spartan past
Annoying Boy of War
If kratos starts thinking like a general not even the world serpent would live. The whole asgard will be flattened and odin would be added on the list of bodycounts kratos leaves behind lol. This version of kratos is sooo tamed hahaha
is it open world game?
I'm going to name Alexa Mimir once the game launch, mark my word
xbox users.. don't cry too much
YES The Fighting Isn't Scripted Like The E3 One Gonna Spend Like 5 Hours A Days With This Game Until My Ps4 Cant Handle It
hi
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start acting like a general!"  *Kratos Vietnam flashbacks*
Man, I’m actually sad that Kratos and Freya are on bad terms now.
Nobody can Defeat Kratos,  Rip Thor
Best game of the year probably
Bro I can’t wait
Tyr made me bisexual
epik wonder how much gb this is
Halo is still better
the old history and game of kretus was much better, now this game of kretus er child game and they speeck childish. Goodbye kretus.
Not on Ps4?
My expectations is very high, and you know what's awesome? I will not be disappointed, I just know that.
Ps5 is garbage. Would like to get it for the classics but naw.
Last time kratos thought like a general a whole mythology got wiped out
few things I noticed. Freya turning into a bird since she was supposed to have a feathered cloak that allowed someone to fly like a bird or become one (I'll admit I'm not a hundred percent sure on that one but either way a cool detail) What look like centaurs and greek soldiers. This implies that the greeks are invading or have been brought over to fight Kratos Tyr has both hands......so that's gonna be fun to see. The blades of chaos and levitation axe are back to base form, I get it from a gameplay stance but that's still weird.  Looks like we will be able to use the blades of chaos as grappling hooks which could make for some really fun movement. And lastly the sheer character growth from where the series began and ended the greek saga. I can't wait to see how the characters grow and develop in this one.
Looking at this again. This looks like it’s gonna be amazing.
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  Kratos: L3+R3
I am so sad that we wont see child atreus anymore, im gonna miss him so much.
لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"
Bro we have *MONKE*
oppie look badass
2022
Father with teenager boy simulation
Boy’s voice dropped
Why do i get the feeling they've gone back in time, was that freya at the end?
Wonder if these lads know that baldur is invulnerable to all threats, physical or magical.
Please it has been so long since trailer of GOW RAGNAROK now release for ps4 to I don't have ps5
Sony company
Happy new year
i love David Jaffe   know ps5 out stock   he release on ps4   version too
Amon Amarth has to do the sound track to this
This is 100% gonna be game of the year
It shocks me that the same voice actor for Atreus sounds so different now
Boy!
You know, if you shaved Tyr's head and trimmed up his beard, he and Kratos could be fraternal twins.
I'm crying cause I can't afford a ps5 crying 😭😢
Yep, Im still watching the trailer
Its 2024 and am still rewatching this trailer.
Thor's voice has the same vibe as Thanos and its give me chills🥶
Looks amazing, still not enough to get me into console gaming though :-(
This game was not made for neo-pagans. Subversive storytelling.
When’s the release date ??
Tyr's kinda short
The annoying kid that ruined the last one is back? Unbelievable.
LOOKS LIKE A CLASSIC
Is it gonna come out for ps4 as well?
Will be only on PS5?
We have all been waiting for this game, that kratos vs thor boss battle will be epic if they execute it right
Man i need a playstation 5
Angrboda was a giantess with reddish hair and muscular. Her hair had the color of the dried blood.  IN THE NAME OF ODIN STOP  BLACKWASHING NORSE MYTHOLOGY PLZ
immediately work on boy's face.. hilarious
I miss the old kratos. Less words, more fights.
🍺🍺💓È quando esce e adesso è 2022
lol ps4 graphics
yh very helpful what month and day will this game come out
0:51 to 1:00 everybody gangster until Kratos's shield breaks
hyped
This game looks so awesome!!! But I'm not going to buy a PS5 just for one game.
huh i was expecting a giant 8ft grey wolf with glowing red eyes to appear
My phone can barely render the trailer
OH SO WHEN KRATOS DOES IT ITS CALLED SPARTAN RAGE AND itS BADASS BUT WHEN I DO IT ITS CALLED ANGER ISSUES AND I NEED THERAPY
Sup🤩
Was so bummed that we didn’t fight Thor as the final boss in the last game! The last boss fight was kind of a let down tbh
This is such a badass game! If this doesn't get you fired up, nothing will!
2022 🔥
Since Tyr has both his hands, does that mean we dont get to see Loki?
I like how Atreus' silhouette appears with horns in the beginning. Loki easter egg?
Bro I bet even kratos was intimidated by Týrs size because kratos has to look up at him like a younger brother looking at bigger brother like jeez týr is massive!
mimir just painting
Kid is annoying fr
Okay so i think Odin and Thor may have kidnapped tyr and imprisoned him in Asgard
I just hope we can get this one on PC aswell.
Ok, don't know if it's just me but I wanna see kratos unleashe a little bit of that rage that I know he still has inside, that sense of empowerment that the previous games made me feel.
I dont know how many times I watched this trailer .. but everytime I saw it...My body pulsing...
Who's the blackie at the end?
Dark Elves To Be Alley
Looks like I need to buy a console again and then sell it right after beating this game.
Wow 10mil visual
Hope there's at least a new weapon
Tellement BON 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Making a game out of a Fortnite skin lol, how low can these game devs get 🤣
Okay but Kratos would not be impressed with Tyr's height, man has see bigger.  Anyways, this. I'm excited for all of this.
Am SOOOO frickin hype for this game! Really hope Odin is the final boss considering this is the end of the games based around Norse mythology in GoW. Also hope there's a lot more original bosses and not like in GoW 4 where most of the bosses are just reskinned trolls. More enemy variety too, but that already looks super promising based on this trailer.
Looks like the boy might have a love interest
Does he acutely take out an army with one hit   Because the last one it took nearly 4 hits it was kinda  boring so I hade no interest it was realdicaleeeease .
Kratos war is not the only way   Me: mm more war 🤔 .  No I was just joking .
Who is the person that does the voice over for Kratos?
Why make the kid sound so American
1:21 is that Svartalfheim?
WOOOOOOOOOO
There armor reminds me of assassin's Creed armor
Not bad DLC
Don’t release this game soon ….I didn’t got ps5 yet …..I can pay 4x price for that but didn’t got
When is it coming out?
I'm still rewatching the trailer lol
What month release?
Atreus: TYR! Sora: RIKU!
I hope we dont have to kill Freya she helped us a lot and was someone kratos actually trusted
Cold chills
ohh lord i need this game
This and elden ring will be 🐐
I have never considered getting a ps5 just for a game.       Except this game.
I. Am ready for this game.
Flipping fantastic graphics,  He is right war is not the only answer. But it is for this game to happen, ON WITH WAR.
Lol. He IS thinking like a general. Dude is wise now. The old Kratos just kill anything that move without thinking.
Sept 30th 2025
🔥❤️
Well that gave me chills
I think I understand why Balder said, “I thought you’d be bigger.”
They looking for Aires or Odin
Why people are really so exciting Nord Mythology than Greek Mythology, it is because thor? or what?
Oi man how long do people have to wait I want it now
Top 1 incoming
War is only the way!
Yeah im pre-ordering that.
I think I know the GAME OF THE YEAR OF 2022  or      2023
That’s another reason on my list to get the ps5
Seeing ppl in a town during a hood of war game is different.
Oh boy.
Is that a new shield I see?
Please make the trailer music available on iTunes😩😩😩
Is this still sunny playing boy? Not going to lie, if it is, its somewhat nice to actually be able to watch the kid grow up as we play.
My face 😳 when tyr stood up.
Imagine kratos in egypt ...
No ragdoll physics in 2022?😆
Hopefully the game will come out soon enough for me. I want that game so badly! I want Kratos to kill Freya!!!
Do whatever you want BUT DON'T YOU DARE KILL KRATOS!
Dad of boy looks great
Mi manera es la manera de los dioses 😡
Hii PlayStation I am from India plzzzz give me ps4
Imagine not owning a PlayStation
I NEED THIS GAME.
What will Kratos call his son when he becomes an adult? “Man”
Holyhggg fukkkkkj
Can I play GOW1 in PS5?
What it looks like is part the tracks through the mines Its a way up the mountain to another mine shaft but I have theories for days on this game I love the series it's been my favorite game since the beginning
Shut up and take my money!
The boi has only grown more disobedient
Why is Tyr so small, and why is Thor so fatttt
I swear, if revenants and the blindness debuff are in this game, I'm not getting it
The way kratos said “no” is hilarious to me
Uou
"Are you coming with us?"  Tyr: Sure thing. It's the least I can do since you gave me a hand...
“Stop thinking like a father and think like a general “. You know what I mean
I love Mimir greatly, so happy to see he sticks around.
Who's the big guy
Will this game ALSO turn my ps4 fans into the loudest helicopter known to man, like the previous game?
I need it
Is for ps4?
WHO STILL WATCHING?!
Atreas be looking like stevewilldoit
Seth Rollins coming with us
Thor sounds like an absolute badass! Ryan Hurst will kill it in the role:)
2:01 you can see atreus using magic in the background, i gasped
Ok
Hold up is Tyr huge or was kratos kneeling???
Play exclusively on  "PS5: No where Available"
2:06 NO
WHOWWWW SO F* EXCITED!!!
I NEED THIS INSIDE ME!!!
i dont thor is even there to fight...it appears he might be the catalyst to getting kratos out of his home
COME ON SANTA MONICA, IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS, GIVE US SOMETHING!
Bom de guerra
Looks tidy
3:04 the girl from the polar express migrated
Hype 👏👏👏
Tyr should be missing is left hand
F
War... has changed.
HOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Only one word I'm gonna say "BOI"
I bet they accidentally end up speeding up Ragnarok while trying to prevent it. Loki is after all a very central piece in Ragnarok so if Atreus even just _leaves_ their hiding place in the woods, I bet it will set a whole lot of things in motion.
we want old kratos with the classic bread
Day 1 purchase, this looks awesome
And just when you  thought Kratos is a big  man ... then Tyr stands up!!
Still waiting on that ps5 console….. sighhhhhh
The meeting of two gods of war. Epic!!
There’s only one way to describe this 🤤
I dont have a ps5 but I'm am so excited for this game
3:06 who is that ??
I hope this won’t only be for PS5
I hope they do cutscene were Kratos sit down and tells him everything
2:27 that place is Asgard for sure
So any chance this is coming to pc?
Days Gone 2 Gooooo
Anyone else still rewatching the trailer
Comon! I just want to see old kratos 💥💥 without him ragnarok is nothing
too bad it´s a cross gen title and not a pure next-gen title...
Thor *"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"* Kratos *"Flashbacks to plunging all of Greece into darkness because he didn't like papa"*
Well according to Eric's twitter today he wrote the following: Dear fans, we at santa monica are fans of our fans and we are so thankful for the huge amount of feedback we have gotten since the announcement of ragnarok. We are aware of your concerns and we hear you. With that being said we have decided to take your advise and not rush this game. We at santa monica would rather as you the fans say "take our time" and give our fans a polished game instead of "a buggy mess." With that being said we have now decided to indeed, take our time and aim for a 2025 release date. We wish you all a very happy holiday and again we are fans of our fans and we want to thank you for all for your concerns and the greatest amount of feedback that we have ever seen. Again we all thank you. We wish you all happy holidays and a very very happy new year. Thank you. P.s. -Ragnarok is coming.
So why would they show a trailer now? The game doesn't come out until 2025.
Going to be another epic exclusive. Kratos is a Beast!
Oglądałem to na kiblu i że zesrałem się jak zobaczyłem 🤯
I shed a tyr of joy
So bad trash
Would be epic if Mimir somehow got his body back at some point.
If you guys watched avengers infinity war you can see that Loki they didn’t really want to say Odin son So a atries or however you spell it could be Loki
Why doesn't kratos want to think like a general?
Boy has matured .This is going to be Fire. 🔥
.
Need this game now
I cant wait 🔥🔥😥
No wonder Baldr thought Kratos would be bigger, he had a brother with strongman build and the other one is imposing and tall.
Father and Boi  The ragnarok
man i want this bch longggg
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos who destroyed the greek pantheon: Yes'nt
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Это вообще хоть чем-то отличается от предыдущей части?
Will it be available  on ps4
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a *_general-_* Kratos: **PTSD flashbacks** NO.
PLS PLAYSTION ONWERP LS ADD THIS I HAVE BEEN WATING FOR SO LONG
El niño ese es un lloron
They have made the chaos blade not only new again, but they went back to old combat strays where he would pull himself, the combat is upgraded so much I am so excited for this
I hope this will be available for PS4 as well
Please don't let this game be released on pc

I hope we can play as atreus. It would be a breath of fresh air. And atreus riding the goat and charging in is just cool af. And that girl in the end? Is she a native american???? Or just a tanned nordic girl
I think the game starts with him having full power while fighting thor and then getting weakened afterward. Having to build strength throughout the game.
Ngl looks sick but how annoying is the voice over for the kid fml
Not even 60fps
I really hope they add more npc’s the previous game felt kinda empty.
I wonder how Tyr will react to seeing  Kratos if he recognises him. he definitely knows who he is because he collected different items from the greek realm including the vase with Kratos on it, seen in the previous game.
Maybe after kratos have wiped out the Norse gods he should come down to Egypt too and wipe them gods out
Tyr 's black airforce energy is through the roof
No ps4😢
How many games are there in this series?
Me, as a teenage boy: Stop acting like a father, and start acting like a General! Dad: Why, you little… *grabs a belt*
I rewatching  this trailer every morning ... 🚶🏿‍♂️
BOY WE HAVE A GODS TO KILL
Will this be available on ps4?
Looks cool too bad you cant buy the hardware to play it.
I am waiting for 🤠👌
the one thing worse than Ragnarok... Teenage angst
WE WANT A DATE. SONY AND SMS PLEEEEEASE!!!
still can't get over this trailer
Dont even jinx it…
This is the only reason i will buy a ps5
No puedo esperar a probar este juegazo en mi play 2 chipiada
Call the avengers.
Kratos sitting with his back to the entrance?
BOY!
Went from golden Valkyrie armor straight back to fur drabs smh
Who is Thor’s voice actor? Sounds like Dave BATISTA ngl
Finally 10M😍🔥
2:34 “let it serve you” than you see Atreus hop on his runic summoning 🤯
And that's the game of the year
at 2:50 looks like me talking to my Big Cousins
I literally can’t stop watching this. I keep coming back to it for the hype!
Freya is so beautiful
I hope this time they dont have repetitive boss fights. The previous one had a lot of the same boss with a different color/skin, it got boring fast.
Why does everyone keep saying this kid is loki? He says "I should be out there finding out who i am and who loki is" i dont get it. Someone please help me understand this
Dang kratos wiped out Greek gods and now he is after all asgard gods
MCU fans be like - So it's mjolnir vs stormbreaker huh?
3:00 What's she meant was the "release date"
Sony where is your Blockchain!
so what year is it in this gow?  action used to take place in antiquity.  well, antiquity is until year 400 ad more or less. but when gow 3 ended and how many years exactly passed since then? locals in  gow 2018  use runes. when runes where invented? when they started being used?  around 1 century ad? so it's plus minus 300 years since the battle  with the colossus...?
when is it coming to PC?
Hopefully Freya gets help from what happended
1:56 kratos doesnt have the blade of chaos on his back wat? did something happen? it would be interesting if he lost it like maybe his enemies getting their hands on blades of chaos. that way they actually put a decent fight against kratos rather than being too ez and no challenge
1:56 interesting.. kratos doesnt have the blade of chaos on his back
We want more interactions with People! 🙏😇
Moment of Crisis panic does not it harness it let it serve you 'Kratos'
So this game is only for ps5?
Magnífico....
i am waiting to see thor in this game
Yes im still rewatching this trailer. 😂
Yeah kratos is calm and reasonable just ask zeus
The dwarfs need to forge a metal body for Mimir at some point, that would be awesome!
"We're trying to stop Ragnarok, to help people".. Who exaclty are these people? I've only seen gods and monsters in this game, I don't even know what I'm saving
i think im going to be selling my slim and upgrade to pro since they're so much cheaper to get now, I ruled out ps5 coz im sure im never gonna get a chance to add to cart lol
1:56 where is the blades of chaos??
One day you'll get ps6 and play this✌️😃☑️↙️
Can’t stop watching this dec2021
O' brotha where art thou ?
Os cute
You guys should use unreal engine for this game abeg
That _play station_ freaked me out. Can't get used to it
these graphics spit on helltrash
Game of the Year goes to GOW5
Uh oh. There's going to be a scene where they torture Atreus and the girl helps keep the poison off of him. Not looking forward to that. But also I am looking forward to that. Gonna smash my feels to bits.
No cap if this is the end of Kratos. It was fun. Psp, ps3, ps4, brings back childhood memories
I need to switch to PS5
Finle
Keaton will go to Egypt after the Norse gods calling it, they foreshadow it in the room with all the Gods stuff like Cleopatras crown
Watching for the 11197 time
1:16 I just noticed those crows, something we didn’t see last game.  Odin’s watching them.
So that voice that asked "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"   Who is that? Sounds a bit like Josh Brolin.
The best place to play 💙💙
This is gonna be the Game Of the Year 2022 beleive that
So awesome,I can't wait dude
Loki is Mercury and Gemini, Virgo. Everything is always about astrology and alchemy.
Kratos: *Throws leviathan axe* Thor: *Throws Mjolnir* Kratos: *Recalls leviathan axe* Thor: Wait a minute... 🤨
Tyr really standing up to Kratos like he is a threat
Tyr's towering hight brings a lot of context to  Baldur's assumption that Kratos would be bigger.
Does it let you play as loki aka atreus on a mission.
Ни одного русского коммента)))я надеюсь первый
waiting for pc one year after release.
I got a question, how is freya attacking when she was cursed by Odin making her  unable to defend herself physically or magically?
Who is tyr and what's his power?
when does it come out
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
iam so happy i almost shed a Tyr
Still unable to understand why this is such an overrated game
❤❤❤❤
Games of the year
Why is this age restricted
3 month 10M view kratos 🔥
kratos ki be hu
Kratos in Aztec mythology would be killer
Didn't really know they had a new Spiderman coming out🤔
2:53  Okay, NOW I truly get why Baldur thought Kratos would be bigger
Tyr's clothes are the same colors as the clothe's of the man Atreus is holding in the final panel of the mural in the original game's ending.... I'll leave this here
I hope there will be more animations  for the death finishers
Jeez!! Can't wait to play it😍🤩😍🤩
I love the words of wisdom Kratos bestows upon Atreus, and in turn, the audience.
If this comes out before I can get a ps5 I'm not getting one might be time to join the PC family 😔
You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?
Thanos
Is it only gonna be on ps5?
No one: Kratos: Boah
1:48 Resident Evil Hunters has arrived Kratos
1:50 that was a jump!!!
It's about drive, it's about power
And game of the Year goes Too...GOW
Atreus is now Big
I am play game at ps4 ya Or not?
Kratos raising a Teenager is a Character Development on Calm and Reasonable Levels
got the ps5 for this!
Freya is going to regret treating Kratos the way she has. If you know a little about Norse mythology there was a possibility that Baldur could've been resurrected but only if all the souls of the nine realms wished for him to return. Everyone did except for Loki. I can see Freya at the feet of Atreus begging for him to wish for Baldurs return and Atreus starts to recite her promises of the tortures she would inflict on Kratos at the end of the last game.
I should put the wod of war 5 for ps4 as many people have it but don't have the money to buy the ps5 (I like it if you want them to do this
calm and reasonable person ROTLFMAO
RIP Thor
Is game in ps4 or ps5 ?
BOY!!!
More like Spoilerok
Take. My. Money. Please!
Seeing Thor's fingers I have to assume he's  chubby
🌹❤️
fya
Great. Now I have to go buy a PS5...
I'm sorry but atreus voice actor doesn't work for me
I see this trailer every day
Will this be on ps4
How much time do they need to downgrade the game to make it playable on the ps4??
i just want jacksepticeye to start a series on this game
Will you make it on PC too? I and many people will be more than happy to buy this magnificent game!
please get it to ps4 too
Whats tougher than beating Sigrun the Valkyrie queen @ level 1? Raising a BOI to become a MAN
I’m just exited to get the chaos blades again
I’m just realising something ,a part of Freya’s curse is that she could not harm in any way another creature , yet here she fights Kratos with a sword ,does that mean she got her Wings back ???
Another Master Piece
And they still arguing💀
Thor: "You seems like a calm and reasonable person"  Me: "Hey! I heard that line somewhere.."    (I can't tell if this line can be sarcastic to kratos or not, so i will keep my mouth shut#)
When do it come out?
The day when Kratos started learning to say "No" and view War ia not the way for solutions... That's the great character
Who’s still rewatching this amazing beautiful game🥰
I hope beast boy shubh returns playing this
i cnt fkn wait just give a relase date already 😫😫 sony santa monica anybody lol
Thor probably knows about kratos's past that is why he called him a calm and reasonable person, considering kratos hates who he once was and has immense regret and guilt over actions that lead to the death millions just for sake of revenge.This is probably thor taunting kratos because as we all know kratos was once everything but calm and reasonable.
Just a Xbox player passing by. Don’t mind me.
Bro can't wait 🔥🔥
I finished GoW 2018 last night, never saw anything about Ragnarok, and I'm beyond excited right now
BOOOYYYYYY!!!!!
Honestly in spite of the problems with the combat , enemies and ARPG elements in the last one , they all seen to have improved and I CAN’T WAIT FOT THIS
POV : You're coming back every once in a while to relive this and wait for the game :)
So they shoehorn a Black chick into this game only for her to be the cause of the end of the world.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Gotta love it
Chills
I’m wondering if we get new weapons tho NGL
Just got my PS5 and this was the main reason why I had to have it 🔥🔥
Was that THOR?
I see atreus is going though that teen phase
I really love that it opens with atreus bringing home an Elk he hunted.  Immediately shows us how mucb atreus has grown by reminding us of how unsure of himself and dependant he was at the beginning of the last game.  I feel like we're gonna see him get pretty cocky in this game.
Pls the date of the game
I want to see kratos bring atrieous back to greece
I thought it's a movie trailer it took me few seconds to realise it's a gaming trailer 😂
if kratos starts thinking like a general no body stands a chance
Yes you are rewatching this trailer
Imagine thor throws his hammer and so does kratos at the same time 🤯
Came back after seeing nothing at the game awards about ragnarok. It was expected but still sad 😢
Hellblade 2 looks so much better than this. Rofl
So bad news, most anticipated game was Elden Ring
I'm selling all my possessions just to get a ps5 and gow😂
Might accidentally spoil but was that THOR!?
Look I'm no racist, but that black girl at the end felt strangely like a "virtues signal" and she looked hella out of place
I love Norse mythology
I really hope they bring back the boots of hermes in this one 💯💯
Will there be another trailer coming soon?
This is my most anticipated game ever, I hope it runs well on ps4 because I'm pretty sure ps5's are a myth
Odin is our ally. Remember i said this. And no this is not edited.
How much coins do players earn by serving in this unreal military or they do it voluntarily.
2:04 woah, a female einherjar, nice.
Does no one care that the graphics are that much better
Got to ask your self who would win in a fight mcu Thor or kratos
I remember boy! Bruh i always say boy! Kratos : boy! Boy! Boooooooy! Boy! Boy! Booy!
2:54 I keep rewatching this just to hear this part. The theme is so godlike and soldier-ey.
When will this come out? I'm hyping myself up watching this again and again
I think kratos's shouts during fights, are going to be remade
What are we hunting?  Tyr Which way?  In the direction of Tyr
2:12 Asgardian?
2nd GOTY award just for the trailer
Bro I cannot wait till this game comes out. I hope it comes out somewhere in January because I want to get this game on my birthday.
Somone should make a Senua vs Kratos Animation
Atreus : Stop thinking like a Fahter for a moment and start thinking like a general. Kratos : L3 + R3
When I saw the hammer I geeked
10,033,860 views Dec 8, 2021
Can’t wait for this
Please just let us wear that fur cape in game
So excited for this!!!
Since he's son is older is he going to start calling him teen?
Dwane Johnson (the rock) should do this as a movie…
Atreus knowing kratos is a general show he knows much more about kratos than he did in the previous game but he still does not know enough
Gonna pre-order
We get the blades in this trailer I can’t wait to go mad crazy on this game
I can’t wait for this game to come out! I hope it will not take long
Man I can wait the anticipation is crazy lol hurry hurry hurry
10 million views in 3 months
Best best best
Easier to win Squid game than to buy a PS5
Who else is here after it hit 10m views?
This is epic. I've watched this trailer so many times.
WOW I kope it will come out very soon
This is like the 20th time I’ve rewatched this
Atreus is the serpent
Looks like the person they free is mimir with his head back on?!
Kratos  the guy who destroyed 2 worlds  and survived
Thinking 🤔, how did this guys come up with the name kratos….
Yesterday i won a PS5 in the office christmas party raffle and GOW: Ragnarok is a most have game i am getting in 2022.
رجع الملك😍
I'm still clueless on who blew the horn when Atreus was sick in the last game. Lol apparently nobody knows. Hopefully this sequel answers that and more
i’m still rewatching the trailer for 100th time🙂
10 million's...
10KK
Yes
It the reason I got a Play Station 2 and now its the reason I am getting a Play Station 5!
2:53 remember when last time someone made eye contact like that with kratos ye you guessed it  Hercules.
Think about it if kratos trained loki then how  badly loki can beat thor .in any universe.
I feel kinda sad that they already showed us that Tyr is alive, I mean like i was hyped af when I saw that we are gonna find Tyr and see whether he is alive or not and ask him for help But now that I know that he is alive it kind of ruined it for me, BUT STILL I AM SOO EXITED TO PLAY THE GAME (> <)
Ill be mad if this masterpiece is only ps5 exclusive
Looks more like a little expansion than a whole new game
cant wait to see someone play this , and watch with them :)
no gore agane? this looks like disney
I hope there a gow 6 Atreus vs kratos
When it’s coming out
You can see that kratos is so serious about the upcoming war.. Boy! This is not a joke anymore  • i love kratos so much.. I consider him as a living man in the real life ♥
Vanir tease at the end.  This whole thing is gonna be epic.
I love how this is for PS5 like you can just go out to Walmart and get one.
Yup, still excited.
It feel more like a movie🤩🤩
The fact he showed absolutely no fear when seeing Tÿr or whatever it is. IS AWESOME!!!
If they have like another game after this that has kratos finally laying down his life, while allowing Atreus to live and become the best he can, and have Atreus get his own series maybe, that would be just incredible
I imagine kratos being worthy of mjolnir
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person   Kratos : L3 + R3 🔥
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General!"  You should have seen what happened through your step-sister when he goes ballistic man...
Atreus voice
level of this game is unmatchable 😍
"Stop thinking like a father and star thinking like a general!"  Last time he thought like a general, he lost the title of father.
What about Brian back the pvp
kratos killing them frogs 😂
"stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  *15 seconds later*  Atreus: "dad why are the gods gone"
Boy was that Zeus ?
Santa Monica Studios showing that there are levels and only a small few are on theirs.
EPIC!!!
Can't wait, see you next year everyone ❤
Are you coming with us ? Let's go to Greek mythology
When tyr stood up it looked just like when kratos was looking at Hercules in gow3
Kratos looks smaller
I wish this was a movie too
I hope in the thor and KRATOS fight they both recall their weapons in the cutscene
This trailer will skyrocket any man's testosterone. Turning a simp into an ultragigamega Chad 💪
I hope there’s a lot more characters to interact with this time around.
Fighting freya made me sad :(
The Worst part of this trailer 3:17
Time to watch this again
“You seem like your a clam and reasonable person are you a calm and reasonable person?”
Don't do it Thor...it's not going to end well
I want to play it NOW
Is that ZEUS?! The tall dude
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best video game
شاهکار
Kratos: “War is not the only way.” *Coming from the man who slaughtered 25 gods in 4 games.*
Date of release?
SONY SONY SONY SONY
Yep still watching it
Tyr is a freaking giant
This game will end with Kratos wielding the Hammer.
did the axe always have a wrap on it?
I can't waiiiiittttt for this
“Calm and reasonable” sure😂
Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general  *ptsd to the pantheon of Olympus*
dude there is so many theories even from this one trailer dude i cant wait for this game
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait
Thor : You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Proceeds to brandish the Blades of Reason and then activates Spartan Calmness.
Is this game on PS4?
it's very very niceeeeeeee I can t wait for it
No new weapon 🥲
I’ve watched this so many times
Thor:- You seem like a calm and a reasonable person.Are you a calm and a reasonable person Kratos:- watch your tone boyyy
Thor asking if Kratos is a calm and reasonable person  Thor also murdering giants:
So what happened with Thor?
If Kratos loses his Blades in the beginning again I swear I'll break the TV.
Honestly i have never seen better graphics it's so amazing especially at 1:21
I really hope they play the theme for ragnarok at GOTY this year..i need to hear it
Fun fact:in 1:49 you can see Atreus punching an enemy using a bow on fire and in 2:02 Atreus has a new magic attack on his bow too
THE TEMPLE OF TYR LOOKS FROZEN BECAUSE THE FIMBULVETR OR FIMBULWINTER
Yoooo they brought back the chain blades
Definitely streaming this chat
Atreus sounds like Jake from Two and a half men
You ruined a game that was much better in 1 2 3
I will be honest...I don't know jack s*** about Ragnarok. 🙄🧐🤔 it's a war to end all gods are something?!?!  Anywho ✌
In one of his tales, Mimir tell us that Odin cursed Freya by stealing her warrior spirit. Therefore she wouldn't be able to attack or defend herself even if she wanted. However at 0:50 we can see that her curse will be broken somehow
Also! That friggin stare down between Tyr and Kratos. From Mimir we know Tyr's godly career consisted of being a peacemaker and diplomat. Kratos' history... well... let's just say he chose another path. Tyr is also far from ignorant of Kratos' exploits, as the pottery in his vault clearly shows how far the Ghost's reputation had spread.   I dunno... I just feel like Tyr isn't thinking about patting Kratos on the back anytime soon. Until he sees how much he's changed. Since the Kratos that Tyr would be famililar with (at least his reputation) is far from the "calm and reasonable person" he now is.
This most be the longets gow game ever. It need to be.
Why spoil the tyr part
I guess you could say this game's gonna be top-Tyr.
hope we get to wear that cape.
I hope this is better than the last one.
Yup, we doing it till the drop. Can't stop watching the trailer.
At 0:40 Two dogs, one white and one black? You thinking what i’m thinking?🤔
Who's that beautiful black girl at the end?
Notice kratos is not surprised, daunted nor threatened by Tyrs size and stature
I have never been as excited for a game as I am for this
I really like that in Kratos will confront Thor and maybe even Odin.
Ps 4?
Can’t wait 🔥🙇
I need this game
This looks insane!!! Amazing
1:31 finally a society in gow..oh it’s been some time hasn’t it since we didn’t see anything of this sort in the 4th game
Can't wait for the game 😉
I know I am a little late to mention this but has anyone noticed the shape of Kratos's axe handle?
Kratos Fans are coming🥰🥰
Boy!
They should make to where you can transfer your old data to the new game
Bro this game is about to carry 2022
This doesn't look any different graphically from the PS4 one.
This trailer is already 2 months old, it felt like it was yesterday, time flies
Tyr may be taller than Kratos, but he still has to look up to face him.
Really didn't like that this trailer showed them finding Tyr, kinda ruined what would have been a pretty big moment in the game. Now I wish I didn't watch this trailer. I won't be watching any more trailers lol, I've been waiting for this game for too long to have parts of it spoiled.
Last exclusive for ps4 R.I.P PS4 you will be missed  2014-2020
Ooh looks like Atreus will have a gf
Will the game be on ps4 or just ps5
😎
how does this video only have 9 million views it needs atleast 50 million
Hurray Atreus love interest and mate is in the game
ちょっと大きくなってる
2:51 ooo
This looks so amazing!!
That was way to hopeful of a trailer boys...this one gonna be a lot of death and bad stuff
The fact that studios take 6+ years to finish a game halfway or even release a trailer and they release a trailer in 3 years is crazy breh
Only on PS 5 ?
Wow game !!!!
When the combat music starts, that's when the mic is dropped, so powerfull and badass!
Hype🔥🔥
Watching this masterpiece again
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Im so excited to watch someone else play this!
still watching like me , eh ?😂
Hopefully this game has air combat...
Thor's voice sounds a lot like Josh Brolin.
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general" Atreus, trust me, you don't want see you father when think and act like a general...😂
Odin heimdall thor freya hrasveglr. Ragnarok's bosses are going to be epic
Mimir for presidency
That music tho....
best trailer
I am still watching this 😂
Gameplay aint great
Since when does aratrus know he's Loki ?
I watch this daily ❤🙌🏾
I feel like they kinda ruined Atreus
The end it's amazing. They didn't want we think they forgot to put a black Angborda, becouse of course, black people exist, (even in the north of Europe)
That crocodile literally ate kratos
Wow Atreus hit puberty
1:01 What did Kratos even say here LOL
Kratos is the only reasonable person who can beat a horse
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍👑
Why am I just now finding out about this?
If Greek Kratos is the Kratos here this should've ended since GoW4
this should give full access to the 9 realms right
Like always your work is amazing santa Monica and my beloved character is always kratos.
Can we see gow ragnarok on PC 1:57
Sigh i am back again....
I can't move my eyes anywhere else due to this I think only thing I can do is watch it again❤❤
Legends are watching this trailer after 2 months😂😂
Is there info on when it is getting to South Africa 🇿🇦?
Mimir: Well, I recognize that dour expression anywhere.  Kratos: Quiet Head!!
KRATOS: in moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you.   Me: Best FARTHER!!✊🏾💪🏾
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it, let it serve you!
Was that Zeus when he pulled the chains from the door?
Cant wait 🔥 🔥 🔥
They will give the Game of the Year award a month before the release of this game
I don’t think I’ve ever been more excited for a game
Still rewatching this trailer..
I know this may come across as nitpicking (especially since it’s not out till next year), but in the trailer at 1:35, there is clipping happening with Kratos’ weapons. With games recently being released unpolished, I just hope details like this can be ironed out.
Will it be on ps4 too?    I hope so 😅
“In moments of crisis, panic does nothing”
I can't wait till this game out guys its soo exciting i can't wait to explore the game
I see many bosses and like DAT a loy
I still watch this trailer
I wouldn't be surprised If the girl from the last scene turned out to be Odin (☉｡☉)!→
🥺 Tears, happy tears.
just please don't make it just more of the same game just with different enemies.
Imagine Kratos Annihilating Thor & Then Uses Mjolnir To Kill Odin's Ravens... 🙂😹.
Atreus: Sees Angrboda.  Also Atreus: PUBERTY'S HAPPENING!
Will this game reliese in ps4 too I hope I'm poor in India n I will buy it pls lunch in ps4 tooo plssssss
Probably come here once a day to watch this
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Are you righteous? Kind? Does your confidence lie in this? Are you loved by all? Know that I was, too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness? Truth?
Don't mind me, just re-watching these astonishing trailers again after 2 months. Sorry, I can't help myself 😂, I'm too hyped for THESE! 😁✌
I like how tyr tries to stare down kratos as if he thinks he's the tallest person kratos has ever met
game of the year material
I always meant to get into gow but idk after watching gow 4 3 times I feel it wouldn't hit the same but after this trailer I just might have too
I'm excited for this game can't wait to play it. I'm am upset that there r people out there trying to make a controversy about angrboda being black. To be honest does it really matter...No! Its a game people get over it there supposed to be fun. Not controversial. People should just be grateful that were getting a sequel to GOW  that's all I can say. Games r for fun not political bs!!!!
Atreus can really use a hammer as melee weapon
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Greek pantheons watching from Hel : "Yep he is."
Pls don't kill kratos  in this series,this series must continue
Actress who is change🥺☹️
seeing kratos instantaneous “NO” response to Atreus “... start thinking like a general” really hits hard to hike knowing Kratos’ past
👏👏👏
I just beat Sigrun on Hard. Now there's nothing left but to wait for winter to end
I lost the hype for this game over wolverine's game but now watching it again, it definitely makes me feel that I want this game to release quick.
Who’s that person at the end??
Dad of Boy: The end of the f*cking World
So the vikings are relevant at the moment lol when are the Israelites getting a game?!
Wow this guy really went from a warrior to a father
I love the new dlc of godofwar it looks nice though
GOW went toooooooooooooo far but i love it
Can't wait for release
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”   “Would you like to know, weather boy”
You cool hearing BOI’s voice changed like he’s actually growing up
Wow
I dont care for Atreus, we all know that the Wall in Jotunheim has already been altered  The only thing that realy matters will be the interactions between the two gods of war
Will this be on pc too?
I hope we could see Mimir meeting Athena. Is something I know it sounds fan service, but I'm kinda hoping to see it
Technically speaking there were black Vikings but there were little black Vikings
why do they release game to a mythical console?
It does feel like a direct sequel in a way I like it. I watched the last one 3 years ago and it was a fun journey with the relationship of Kratos and Atreus, and yesterday I got the chance to finally experience it.
COOOMMEEEE OOOOOOONNN
when ever i want to feel like a calm and reasonable person i come here.
Ahh yes this game is going to be top *TYR*.
Sony made 50k $ just from the views, what a successful company, cant wait for the game 😍
We are going to pre order a ps5? From where In the directions of ps5
I’ve come back to this video like 15 times already
PS 4 PLEASE
This brings a Tyr to my eye
what has more realistic physics the original Sonic games or the original Mario games? And why?
glad to see atreus progressing sad to say the combat is relatively the same
We need fat thicc thor
👆My account has been recover just now I contacted him
Who would dislike this beautiful trailer from a beatiful franchise? :u
I got all the chills.
lol ps5 only rofl...i cant buy ps5 cause in my land is no ps5 to buy...
That's Angrboda at the end.  She was the mother of Loki's children in the poetic eddas. Loki had three children with her Fenrir, The world serpant and Hel
Which date release this game?
Ohhh me vengo
My question is will it be on ps4 it’s gotta be cuz it’s a ps exclusive. If miles morales was on PS4 then ragnorak must
wow better than movie trailers  .... :D
is tyr bound by gleipnir?
Rewatching
Got a PS5 now I can’t wait 🔥
Is this game comming to pc??
Why dont we just give it game of the year for next year right now ..... its inevetible
it’s crazy cause I just realized that if you look closely at the wooden mural in GoW it shows tyr is actually chained up 🤯
Ohh mimr now got both eyes
7.6 dislikes are not reasonable people L3 +R3
Probably the videogame i’ve been the most hyped about ever.
all these ps5 exclusive coming next year  going to  fight over who getting game of year 2022
Ah yes, this is the 20th time I’ve watched this trailer, and will not be the last
*the selfish desire of peace, creates wars* same is gonna happen here
Just finished GOW (got around ~90% completion within 2 weeks) after putting it off ever since I got my PS5…. What an absolutely astonishing game - the immersive experience of exploring Midgard, hearing all Mimir’s tales, lore markers, the gameplay, the environment - what a gem, I’m so happy and thankful that Ragnarök is ‘right around the corner’.
Thinking how kratos gonna kill Asgard family...
Old kratos :- don't fight with gods Young kratos from inside :- oh come on dude....
Thor isn't going to be the only boss kratos will be facing. He will have to beat all of the Asgardians in order to get to Thor.
Yep, I’m preordering
Who all missing Aphrodite 😘😘
Just can stop saying the magic Word "wao"
Release:2022
wait only ps5 ?? what about for ps4??
So, when is Kratos going to kill Atreus? :E
So glad I got my ps5 to experience this amazing masterpiece when it comes out!💕😁
WTH. Since when is there a trailer O.o
Atreus is adult 😍😍!
I was shocked to hear the voice of atreus honestly fits him better
WwwwwvvvVvvVVVWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The one in the mural that Atreus is crying and holding over in jötunheim has to be tyr and the words come are coming out of his mouth not the snake
When is this game coming out ?
Dude I can’t wait
add the Multiplayer and PVP
In my opinion, Tyr shouldn’t have been in the trailer
Plzz bring it on PS4
Atreus: Father, there're "O" button above her, should I- Kratos: NO!!!
Is this going to be available on the ps4?
In moments of crisis... panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you...
I can't tell if this is PS4 or PS5 graphics
Can't wait!! Anyone wondered what if Norse mythology actually dates as far back as ancient Greek or Egyptian mythology or perhaps even older? Afterall many viking raids took place during the ancient Greek period of a few 1000 BC and have traded with the Greeks, sharing their mythology with the Greeks. Explain why there are many similarities between the 2 mythologies? Seems like very strong evidence that the viking age is far older than we are led to believe.     Also many runestones in Norway (birthplace of the Poetic Edda) were found to be at least 5000 years old. What if Odin carved those? Afterall it's only been a few years after Kratos left Greece after the events of GoW 3 to settle in ancient Norway. So many questions left unanswered.
Shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im so excited to play! but it not yet out
Atreus:Stop thinking like a father and start thiking like a genral  Kratos:Ok Thor and Odin your time is over
" Baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical "
so... why is there an asian girl in this game situated in norse mythology...?  please don't go woke, GOW... please oh please oh please don't go woke....
This is gonna be epic
BOY
Okay, 2:12 we see a flash of rainbow light and a man in golden armor with a helmet that appears to have ram horns.. Heimdall?
so Freya must have gotten her warrior spirit back.
Still watching
Still No Proper Release Date🤦🤦🤦🤦
He should use Blade of Hades this time.
😲😲😲😭😭
Amazing
Wowww a game for age 6 to 10 nice job🤢
2:24 why don't you tell that to the gamers.
I'm so used to atreus kid voice , this new teen voice is 👎
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
They sound like they are from Texas ...
I'm only buying PS5 for this.
0:22 that’s some foreshadowing as to Loki getting his antler helmet
I do hope Atreus didn't grow up to be one of those punchable teens.
2:48 me as an adult asking my dad if he wanna go join beer night with us
Anyone else ready to see boy become man
People thought GTA but with cowboys is gonna beat this masterpiece?
I can't wait 🥰
Bruh they finally took away the age restrict
Literally the only reason why I got a PS5
ok they should have kept Terrence Connor Carson voicing kratos no disrespect to  Christopher judge but he sounds like he has alot of mucus in his throat the whole game
Now THIS looks like a system seller! Holding out to play the latest GoW until I find a PS5; nothing breaks immersion quite like it sounding like an airplane is in my gaming room
1:58
I wonder if there will be any quick time events if you know what i mean ;)
Was the tall guy at the end Rasputin?
The day i purchase this game…  Son: Dad i want to watch Spiderman  Me: Boi! Hold my Lemnian Wine
The twilight of the gods   And the rebirth
Reason to choose PS5 over series x
I've just platine GOW and I can't wait for this one
My body is ready
I wish we will get it on ps4 🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻
Fun fact: Tyr is still shorter than Hercules, so Kratos is probably not impressed Xd.
I have a feeling this game will come out relatively early 2022, probably June at the latest, considering they seem to have done most of the heavy lifting already
Thor’s voice is so evil 🔥😍
Awful game series. Such overhyped. People play and don’t really like it, they just say they do to seem ‘with it’ LOL
"are you a calm and a reasonable person?”  "Ahh yes, let me turn on my calmness of Sparta and tell you with the blades of Harmony”
still cant get over this
I have the single DUMBEST grin on my face right now
I can‘t wait to watch the 6 hours of cutscenes
Looks just as boring as the last one
Looks like Tyr still has both hands. I hope Fenrir is in this one.
🤦‍♂️
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general"  I don't think Atreus really wants THAT Kratos to show up.
The symbolism atreus the new gaurdian of jotunheim
Seriously can’t wait for this
excellent.
Hi everyone i think this is not tyr this is odin! screen this and tell me fact or fiction
Missing that O sign but this one will be a masterpiece :0
Not the gonna lie, the dark-skinned girl was beautiful!
The background is apt to show that Ragnarok is already set in motion. And the warriors have started on their journey to fulfil their destinies. Everyone needs to play their part in the end of the world...
Tyr jumps on wall, Kratos jumps on his back, Loki on Kratos back, is the new wall climbing mechanic.
I love how mimir it's painting super casual
Has visibly Kratos aged further from the last game ?
For those who’s wondering who is the girl in the end of the trailer, her name is Angrboda. And she’s Loki’s wife in the myth.
can't wait, but i am really wondering what is thr explanation gor the weapons and srmor downgrading
1:56 Oh Atreus if you only knew how much of a general Kratos is
Eu acho que já revi esse trailer umas 50 vezes hahaha
The boy now is smart man
Yes!!!!
Can we get a option to mute the annoying child this time
Welcome to your 10000th time of watching this :)
I would love to see kratos be able to use the blade of Olympus in this
I've watched this trailer 9,457,988 times now...
The definition of hype.
Hey guys could we please please please not spoil the game when it comes out. Just have a little common courtesy please.
I can't waittttt
Here I am again...
Kratos might as well join the avengers 💀
Game of the year for 2022
if rage of sparta drops in here imma have a heart attack
Man i exicted.  Wait i just remembered i'm broke.
The second game felt more like dlc rather than sequel. Maybe because of the similiarity in graphic quality
Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a gen *multiple flashbacks* NO!
I am still watching this trailer two months after it came out
la wea amlaa
Another walking simulator in the park with the boi?
2:50 I thought he (Tyr) was standing lol
Watching it again.
R.I.P. to the guy who created the Axe battle system, forgot his name, but ya man may you rest in Valhalla
if anyone had to play the young girl giant, it would surely be zendaya. kinda looks like her
Kratos is the Ragnarok
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”                                      Kratos      *Let the rage of the gods drive your blades*       *Let the rage of the titans fuel your blades*          *Let the rage of Sparta fuel your blade*                    **Spartan Rage Available**
I will come back here when this game launches on PC
weren't they supposed to fight Thor ? m confused 🙄
I am enjoying the fact that Kratos and Atreus gave Mimir his own corner in their home.
I wonder how many times I'm gonna rewatch this till the game is released
looks like an add-on, the graphics peak in 2018
hope showing tyr wasn't a bad idea
What's next???Japanese Gods??? OK.
awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! much awaited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"After Balder’s funeral, the giantess Thökk, probably Loki in disguise, refused to weep the tears that would release Balder from death." DUDE!!! I think it is possible that Baldr is going to come back for GoW5!!! That would be so dope.
Shouldn't have watched this trailer again today... So much for No Nut November...
This is awesome. That being said they never should have shown Tyr. Now I know what he looks like
Kratos faces his toughest challenge yet raising a teenager
OMFGod od war
plss make this on ps4 we cant afford ps5 plss spiderman and future games for alsoo ps4 plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Plz make spiderman for pc
Конечно же за такую толерастскую, неуместную Ангрбоду - большущий дизреспект и минус. Имхо
I’ve watched the video like 20 times  And every time it gives me goosebumps
“War is not the only way.” That’s true
Why isnt this trailer in 4k 60fps?
Always wanted to get a play station again with this coming i think i will
Can’t wait m8
Does freya remembered you zeus?
Now I realized why did the giants trusted Tyr!
Oooaaahh I love this 2:12 imma save it
Tbh, I feel like Thor and Kratos would be evenly matched in terms of strength.
Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos:  my wife and daughter's ashes are tattooed on my skin
ohhhh boi
Is it coming to ps4
Why does Thor sounds like a dude from the midwest?
I hope you can fight with tyr 😯😯
Tyr is alive!!! Can't wait!!!
I really hope We get to take Mjölnir and use it
Will it be exclusive for ps5 or both
I really really really wish they would tie in the egyptian mythology,  imagine fighting anubis or set at the great pyramids with Kratos! Would be dope AF
Anyone else ready to watch Jackspeticeye play this?
Bro making Thor fat was a dumb idea 😂
START THINKING LIKE A GENERAL?!  BROH HE’S A CURSED MASS MURDER TF
Waiting so badly
Can you fix the camera
Dude 3:05
Brasileiros alguém?
:v
Atreus: "stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!" Kratos: *Vietnam flashback to when Kratos was got annihilated by Zeus*
Kratos is a calm and reasonable person.
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a genera-  NO!
"You seem like a kong and reasonable person" "Are you a kong and reasonable person?"
Please relase on Pc

The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment. Students run back and forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound.
I can't wait to see the PS5 vs PS4 graphics comparisons lol
This is the most hyped I've been for a game in a series I've never even played before.
Dayum he's big
Boi:“…Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a gener-“  Dadtos: “No!” 🤣
ok now im getting a ps5
I replayed the trailer 3 billion times
after 2022 come back 2027 to wait for new one
I'm glad mimir is still around, it wouldn't make sense if he disappeared but he's still my favorite character
It wouldn’t be a modern game if they didn’t shoehorn some random “diversity” character in there at the end. Hahaha. Ffs.
2:52 Tyr should be more careful, last person to do that got his face beat in.
A
Annunaki last scene
Kratos' kid is so annoying, why the devs go and have to create his character ?  💩
What where is ps4
I LITERALLY CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME! And when i say literally i mean it, 'cause i'm watching and rewatching this trailer instead of working.
I was hoping for a new weapon😅🗡
Wow
You do not know WHAT MOTHER WANTED
진짜 PC질 역겹다
You’ll notice that Freya seemed to specifically attack Kratos and left Atreus untouched and frankly disregarded. Perhaps she only has ill emotions toward Kratos as Atreus had some semblance of innocence during the death of Baldur.
needs more blood
I NEED this game soon gaming is in such a drought rn
Kratos vs Thor... That Is something worth seeing
Only on PlayStation
2:00 cool
Is this game will be available in ps4
Gotta get bigger for this game
Imagine young Kratos screaming Thor’s name  *THORRR!!*
1:15
Gosebumps gosebumps gosebumps
I can only hope for a pc release 🙏!
Stop thinking like a father and think like a General....what'd you know, Atreus!
Gotta secure that ps5
Can’t wait for it!!
I WANT BLOOD, I WANT BADASS FINISHERS!!
How am I just finding about this now ?
Boyyyyyyyy is back
i keep replaying this
Yes yes yes !!!!
Freya : transform into animal Atreus : *gasp loudly*
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable man. Me: Dude, did you even play the original trilogy????
*Also released with Hindi language option*
The trailer: *being amazing* That one last scene: I’m about to ruin this man’s whole career
❄️
we want old kratos
Warmonger becomes a philosopher. Bloodlust transform into wisdom. Who is that old man calmingly chopping up the wood, turned out he used to be a godslayer, long time ago...
We want bully 2
I swear on release date im gonna do everything in my power to get the game also remember how in the 2018 game we couldn't go to some of the 9 realms? Yeah we might be able to go to one of them in this game.
One thing that I hope Santa Monica does in this game, is have it where Kratos and Tyr are fighting alongside each other, during the events of Ragnarok.
Man. This reminds me of when Hercules towered over Kratos
Lol’ing entirely at the forced diversity character
wait if Atreus is Loki wouldn't Jormungandr be his son?
Cadê os br🇧🇷
lets push it to 10million views!!!
1:54
When is released?
2:00 my L3 and R3 sticks beg to differ
Arteus is Loki. Did ya'll spot how he was carring this dear ? Where the horns were ?
Kratos: Are you coming with us ? Tyr: I thought you'd be bigger
In the end there only be a chaos
Angrboda is the Mother of All Monsters and Loki's mate in Norse Mythology.  I will see my way out.
I watch this trailer on repeat nearly everyday!!
I wonder if Kratos actually goes back to Greese, will he visit Deimo’s grave?
Kratos went from greek to the norse world...Ya makes perfect sense to me
boi
This game looks cooler than the other side of my pillow
Thor returns
waiting for the next Kratos in ancient Egypt gods realm (2026)
"in moments of crisis panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you"  is what I tell myself when I get Monday work e-mails.
I have to get a PS5.  Ahck. This and Spider-Man.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now I can call the levathian axe by Right Mouse Button.
1:02 bet Kratos is going to get used again and that's exactly what Mother wanted
graphically looks no better than the ps4 game. lol
Waiting for 2025 to play this on PC
Thor is gangsta until kratos wears zeus Armor and gets rage mode
Idk if I’m crazy but I think Freya made a deal with Odin to kill Kratos, she seems to no longer have the curse that prevents her from fighting others that Odin gave her
Now I have to buy a ps5
Thor has no chance against kratos.
whatt!!!!!!!!!!!!
shaking crying cant wait
Now I think the boy will be jump gaps or climb on his instead of jumping on kratos's back😂😂😂😂
Algum brasileiro?
The haters .... Probably have a Xbox .
I can’t wait for this game to come out but I don’t see the Cuirass of Zeus on kratos, that I worked so hard to get lol
Is that Josh Brolin voicing Thor? Mega Thanos vibes
02:54 hello ... brother 🤔🤔🤔
😲😲
"We are hunting Tyr"  Where  "In the direction of Tyr"
Why is there a black girl in Greek/Nordic mythology?
este juego va a ser muy bueno
I wish gow 5 isnt just them finding tyr then ragnarok will be on 6
I can't remember how many times I watched this
When Thor asks are you a calm and reasonable person. I wonder if he’s trying to ask Kratos for help or reason with him or if he’s just trying to insult him?
Anybody notice that the wolves are silver and black  which skoll and hati
Epic trailer thank you soo much Santa Monica make this awesome game trailer ❤ I really can't wait for this super awesome game
Ojala y ya salga
Will this game only be on ps5 or can we play it on ps4 aswell?
Atrues part 6 will be finally a full grown man that kill his father
better than segs
Greek man in Norse country   Everyone: tHiCk Us AcCeNtS
Me and Loki have basically lived the same lives but in different times of the world lol
The fact that it’s highly likely that tyr knows who kratos is and knows what he’s done is gonna be interesting to see how that plays out
1:57 "NO!!"
Still waiting for trailer #2
Man can't wait to wait 3 years before it comes to PC!
Drengr of Rangarok!
"We're trying to stop Ragnarok"  *But Ragnarok has already begun... You cannot stop it!*
I wonder if there going to bring back the trope of taking weapons or abilities from people because If I remember Norse Thor's hammer is not enchanted just really really heavy witch is why Thor, Giants, and probably kratos are the only ones who can lift it and leads to some funny stories because Thor and Giants have it out for each other
The... looks like Zeus，I hope I was wrong
1:41 “One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.” - Master Oogway
Steven Universe
Kratos, go home, go back to Sparta, go back to your world, go back, to your roots.
Soooo its last norse chapter . Well its time for egipt chapter yeeees. Am i right?
que suculento XD
Having an xbox I choose to grab a PS5, wise choice all the games I've missed..just completed GOW what a game 9/10 just epic, looking forward to the new one
I'd like to mention the girl at the end is supposed to be mythological mother of Fenrir ,Hel, and Jormungandr if my memory is correct.
I'm an old wolf. Been around since the Next-Gen console wars of the PS3, Wii and the Xbox 360. I mean, I owned every Playstation, but it wasn't until the Wii and 360 came out that we had a proper sales war, because the PS3 was financially unattractive, which gave the other two consoles a head start. If it wasn't for the great exclusives and true craftmanship of Sony and it's affiliate studios, they probably would have called it quits on the PS3. But they didn't, they continued pumping out the goods.   Always knew Sony is the true master of console video games. I'm curious, after all these years... and after seeing this and all the other PS5 tech demos. Is anyone still thinking Nintendo or Microsoft are any match?
From spectating standpoint this game needs a battle royale to last longer than 2 weeks
I smell another Game Of The Year
Pls is this game coming on the PS4 as well
Enter Interracial relationship for race relations and strong independent woman that doesn't need a man's help
The only thing that this trailer is missing: “Boy”
The end
Interesting detail, Freya actually cut into Krotos shield.
kinda disappointed on the graphics upgrade. I expected better but its the sane
I feel like this will be a more SERIOUS kratos cause he’s really gonna have to use his voice to raise his now teen son Atreus which will not be easy
Can't wait to play it on PC!
Just wait till we see FENRIR 😍😍😍😍  I’m so wet rn
Fantastic
Tyr might be the reason that Baldur thought Kratos would be taller.
MJOLNIR VS THE BLADE OF OLYMPUS  ANYONE ?
how old is atreus? 16?
Hello Pc community, Atreus is loki, it is revealed at the end of the game, and Baldur is the son of the forest witch
Looks like Odin isn’t playing around. Seems that he’s sending out his Einherjar.
Thor: How much calm and reasonable person are you? Kratos: Yes
Oh man, i love this game so much. I could almost cry seeing this :)
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you.
political correctness alert, black norse goddess for no reason, someday they will make President Washington a black dude too, even a black lady, just for the same reason
Vocês estão vendendo jogos pra PC né.... melhorar os títulos dão na plus nada... só lixo atrás de lixo vão tomar no cu
Now I regret buying a Xbox
I just noticed that the shape of the shield changed a couple of times
Can't wait to play it on my pc
Thor: 'Are you a calm and reasonable person?' Kratos: 'I'm gonna need that hammer.' Thor: 'What?' Kratos: 'What?'
I cannot believe Atreus is a BIG boi now
a black woman in scandinavia. brilliant
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General!"  Well ... i'm not sure about that kid. The last time your father thought like a general, the whole Greek Mythology was wipe out of existance
Just give us the classic Kratos skin
I'm already in tyrs
POV: when you see the PE teacher challenge the janitor 2:52
The ending is a flashback
Is that opie from sons of anarchy?
I know it is inevitably going to be hyped, but let's remember that the quality of the most hyped games is just like Atreus' future: not set in stone. That said, yes, I am very hopeful Santa Monica will deliver.
Wheeeeennn????
This and Elden Ring are my most anticipated games coming out.
oh i can't wait to play it on PC in 2025 !
I wonder it releases on pc😕
Surely we'll get an official release date before or around Christmas time? 😬
Just completed watching it the 20th time!
I believe I saw an asgaurdian,  and a light elf fight in the trailer, definitely new enemy's
1:36 he said what i was thinking
After i saw this trailer i decided to buy PS5
4 years later will coming to pc so dont show me that ps logo in the end.
Maybe it’s just me but is Kratos getting more Swole
Basically Kratoz NOW its a Calm & Reasonable Person not Before thoe
Idk why, but I love how kratos punches the horse part of the centaur XD
Still watching this trailer over a month later, I can’t help myself I’m too hyped 😂
Loki wants to stop Ragnarok,.....Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
Thor: Are you a calm,and reasonableperson? Kratos: Dont make me get the pipe ope
I hope I love long enough to play it🤣🤣🤣 SERIOUSLY THOUGH!
pc please
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
From this trailer, i know that Greece or Olympus is more advance and Civilization than Asgard
Atreus : Time is running out Kratos : Are you coming with us
Unlike is given by thor's fake account 😂
It is perfect until we see Angrboda
Me to
The one who doesn't play but gets excited cause she knows she will be able to see others play the game 🙈
Will it be on ps4 too?
Me too, can't wait for it to release........
silhouette of atreus at the beginning look like he has horns. Also Loki has horns. Genius foreshadowing
Oh dear! This will be absolutely EPIC! Another game of the year!
Can't wait to mod it on my PC!
I feel like boy is going to get out of control. And leave kratos with 2 choices. His life. Or boys life.
tyr trying to size up kratos: kratos fighting:cronos,hercoles and other bigger things than kratos
“boy” - kratos 3021
bring spiderman miles morales to PC !!! come come !!
aa gai bhai
Soon to be realesed in a better platform.
2018: I don't need it 2019: I _don't_ need it 2020: I *_seriously_* don't need it   2021: _I_ *_NEEEEEEEEEEED_* _IIIIIIIIIIITTT_
Kratos and tyr... they have small talk before kratos invite him
Looks like freya is getting absolutely bodied in this game. I mean the guy took out the entire Greek pantheon. These Norse fools stand little chance. Even the world serpent can get it if it wants
Looks the same like last game. Last game was so overrated tho.
I know it will come for PC eventually but come on man I want this game to be released on pc on the same date as for PlayStation..
"It's getting out of hand now there are two of them"
I like how they remade some attacks like heavy and light runic attacks and oringal attacks
The best trailer i seen in my life
Still watching this man
"Come in".   Idk, people are posting quotes from the clip. Did I do it right?
Ah so those two still don't fully get along after all those years
just give me this in 4k 60fps
Is it play in ps4?
BOYCOTT PLAYSTATION, BOYCOTT NON PS EXCLUSIVE GAMES！！！
I need this game on ps4
Imagine if tyr just speaks German to us
Is it upcoming on ps4?
1:14 that's the Lake of the nine, and it's frozen!
Is only for next gen?
Angrboda looks cute.
Ангрбода негр..
Greatest video game series ever
OoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Why is atraes kinda daddy now
Plz make spiderman for pc Plz ❤️❤️❤️i cant afford playstation
So this can not be played on PS4 pro?
Thor: are you calm and reasonable person,are you? Kratos : L3 + R3
HOW DID I MISS THIS?! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TRAILER FOR 3 YEARS AND IT'S BEEN OUT FOR A MONTH WITHOUT ME REALISING!
Petty thor-are you a calm and reasonable person.   Kratos-no!
Our kratos too old now. Hehhe. Sony thanks for great games since I was in elementary student.. Until now I got 2 child often play ps2 and ps3. Hehhe
Still watching after every day
I hope Mimir will be more useful just like Helious head, or at least he can be used like buffer for Kratos rage or health
Really hope that we will find out what that bird in hellheim is
I can’t wait
Thor sounded like Josh Brolin. Could they have got such a big name actor??
I'm a Ps4 Pro owner. I am so glad that Ragnarok takes place in PS4.
Siuuuuu
So it’s only for ps5 fanfuckingtastic🤦🏻
Imagine kratos' devastation when he discovers Faye only used him for vengeance on the Asgardians
I hope I will be able to find a PS5 by the time this game comes out.
🔥🔥🔥
I wouldn’t be surprised if Kratos lifts mjolnir and caves Thor’s head with it.
Why does everyone insist on putting black people in the Nordic world? Is it hard to understand that there were no blacks in the Viking world?
Can't wait to play this on PC in 5 years!
I wonder who Durlin is
When is the next ps5 wave coming?
Wow🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Joffrey ???😂😂
Is this coming PC also? i'm just curious.  thanks
I like how the Omega symbol in the logo is a snake. Jormungandr might have a bigger role this time.
People complaining that the game looks the same as the 2018 game, must’ve not seen the new Zelda game trailer 🤡
Can't wait to play on PC hehehehe
What happens if in the end cut we see odin
what's with this video having a clip
PS5??? WHERE IS THE PS4 ON TITLE!!!!!!!!
Yo
Start thinking like a general!!! 🔥🔥🔥
2:52 This is the same look that Hercules gave kratos when they met in Olympus. Trying to look intimidating, look what happen to him😂
best part of the game would be   kratos vs Thor
📱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤧

Can’t wait to play this in PC lol
This looks great
dislike you know why
Can't wait to see Kratos Vs. Thor. Who wins?
Amazing trailer
I do not know if I'm living or just waiting for this game to be done.
Can't wait for this to come to pc in 2025 😁
Listen if it comes to Ps4 then it will definitely come to PC too.
آقای متقی هم هستند 😂
A black Angrboda in a nordic mythology woke is terrible man 😂
Is it just me or did Kratos beard got longer
You forgot PC from the title. ;)
Kratos in Egyptian lands, this is enthusiastic
Kratos in Egyptian lands, this is enthusiastic
Kratos in Egyptian lands, this is enthusiastic
Kratos in Egyptian lands, this is enthusiastic
This trailer is almost perfect, because of the wokeness
Руская озвучка пизже
pleeeeeeease release it for PC close the Playstation release ..
That's it. The only reason I would've wanted a playstation, and now I don't even need to waste money on it.
PC
Only play station??? Lol
sony u wouldnt see my comment but of u would never relase it in pc
3:06 is this vanaheim.????
Nice, it seems we're gonna have Einherjar as enemies in the game.
Please increase FOV. I disliked the GoW 2018 due to its awful camera angle.
Looking at all these comments about Fenrir, can't wait to see the bit about Sleipnir, since...you know.... -Loki got shagged by a stallion- some horsing around happened
When will this game come out, boi? 😁
Manodiki oka papa dorikinde rooooooyy.😅😅😅
oh boy, here I go killing again
I like that it's the same graphics to keep the same continuity. But next one after that needs to be a higher level.
Im guessing the young girl is sigyn
Still watchin'
Thor: Are you calm and a reasonable person?   Kratos: Ever heard of Olympus?  Thor: No  Kratos: Exactly!
whos the black girl? whys she in Scandinavia?
Is this com for ps4 and ps5 yeah ... yeah???
Can’t wait to not play this game because it’s near impossible to get a ps5
qe
Isnt Atreus the same name from that epic classic movie. The NeverEnding History. The friend of Bastian.
Coming to PC too yuhuuu. Yupiii 😆😆
No rooms for weaknesses Kratos...
Aaannnddd Atreus is still annoying AF
Graphics don’t look any better. That’s a let down.
Can't wait to see jacksepticeyes play through
After finally playing through the previous game I'm understanding a lot more of what's happening in this trailer
2018: I want you to be a dad 2022: I want you to be a general  [L3] + [R3]
Copping a PS5 just for this game.
How can Fray attack them? Isnt she cursed to never be able to attack any living creature?
Yeah this is a baddass trailer i am super hyped for this game 🤤😊🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyr better step back, last dude to get in kratos face like that was Hercules…
Why do i keep coming back for This GODTRAILER Everyday?!
all these dislikes from jealous xbox dweebs.
:0
Cant wait to meet anubis.....wait.
Back for my weekly watch
I think those two wolves pulling them are skoll and hati. If so I'm so hyped how they would reveal it.
Goosebumps.....
I’m so hyped
Are there centaurs in Norse mythology? I for sure saw a centaur
Can't wait to play this on PC.
this is SICK!!!
I CAN'T WAIT!!!
You get your answers soon enough. I feel like they purposely put that scene in the game to hype us even more than we already are lol.
Will this be on the PS4 as well?
I am exicted
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Did you *NOT* see what he did to your son and brother?
maybe the girl will be Atreus  wife
So this is a timed exclusive right.. High chance of having a pc port in the future.
why in a nordic mithology game appears a black person?
Back again for my daily watch
GREAT FREAKING GAME
TAKE MY MONEEYYYYYYYY
GoW was a masterpiece. This looks even better.   I wonder when there's going to be a movie series of these games. But I'm sure it will happen eventually..
Old weapon not new 😵😵😵
O próximo a morre vai ser Thor  ✌✌✌
When it's coming to PC?
Looks like we will be able to jump in the,I that we will be able to jump freely as we wish not just button prompts.
😍
Black SCANDINAVIAN goddess?! Well, okay....
I will get it at any cost
Вот и чернокожих в скандинавскую мифологию завезли.
Fat Thor and a sub-saharan girl in a European/Nordic Mythology... gtfo
that's zeus?
Who made this trailer? This looks more of like clips from the gameplay then an actual trailer 🤦🏽‍♂️
BOI
I hope there are variations of an armor set like the one Kratos is wearing in the beginning of the trailer. I’ve always imagined him in the Viking chieftain armor ever since this Norse era started
My only complaint with this trailer is Tyre's reveal. Kinda wish it was kept alluded until the actual game 😅
30fps
idk, seems a bit SPOILER-Y
They really had to add one….
1:35 i don't like this
Quero jogar todos eles 😍😘
I love how the beginning trailer shows Atreus' silhouette in the blizzard carrying that elk and giving him the horned Loki helm look almost foreshadowing what he may look like in the future...
I’m still waiting for Odin to make an appearance.
I hope we'll see Fenrir in this. And have the option to pet him.
Im kinda disappointed he didn't get the blades of Olympus to destroy thor and his hammer
Atreus' voice acting is annoying.
It's not about stopping Ragnarok, it's about causing it. But everyone already knew that.
How many other times i'm gonna see this trailer 👇
Atreus voice changed
𝗞𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝘀 saying war is not the only way
2:32 rectangular shield okey... 2:35 that reminds me of Captain America's wakanda shield.
I've been back here too many times
The most epic and best game of the history of games is coming soon goosebumps
Replacing the boat with a sled I see. I want double the stories
An Egyptian version of GOW would be sick!
And then, there is still people who buying xbox
THERE ARE NO WORDS ON GODS GREEN EARTH TO DESCRIBE HOW SPECTACULARLY ERECT I AM
This game is gonna be amazing
Kraits, I know u gonna do it again
wish it came on pc
So since we getting viking theme what about the other two realms like Egypt and I dont know the other one since I have to go back to playing gow. It is where he said it means war on the sigil of his own realm of the tale of Tyre
Bruh these trailers give out too much info lol
It's only on PS5?
Punching the air rn bc it won’t be available on pc😭
Does Broks voice sound different?
Do u have valkriyes and that stuff?
I'm still watch this trailer!🤷‍♂️😂
If that was Tyr, shouldn't he be missing a hand?
It's not too much to say that this will be a game of the year.
I don't mind waiting for when this gets released, cause i don't want it to end up like cyber punk
They must rename the title to gods of war. So hype for this.
3:05 The battlefield 5 move right there. In norse mythology, giants were not black ggwp
Kratos:Boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy        Boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy Boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy
But this is an amazing trailer
When will the game comes out ? I'm so hyped
I would love to give us some fights in the arena like in the assassin creed ODYSSEY//, or something similar/ anyway i read that it’s going to be delayed this game / reason it’s the actor who’s playing KRATOS . I hope we don’t have to wait to long .
I watched every day before I sleep
I can’t freaking wait!!!
imagine Chris Hemsworth play as thor in this game
“Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general” Kratos never mentioned he was a general in GOW 2018, maybe he’s told Atreus more about his past life?
Top 5 most rewatchable trailers
Welp where can I buy a ps5.
I watch this trailer religiously
Me: "Grown up Boy? Dog sledding? Durlin? Asgardians? Týr?" Santa Monica Studio: "You'll get your answers soon enough. Most of them"
Bro they copied the guy from fortnite
Is it still Christopher judge
Well........ I have a prediction.....you see how the magni and modi kept on saying about atreus's mother.....and the previous game began without telling how Faye died.....I believe when KRATOS's wife was alone.....the aiser gods did something to her....and KRATOS and atreus never really talked about it.....and in this game.....KRATOS would support atreus to avenge his mother as KRATOS when he found Faye....she was unconscious....even he doesn't know what happened....thus atreus and KRATOS taking the path of avenging Faye.......
So I take it Tyr will end up being the big bad final boss in this one?
Watching 12th time
Rewatching and sharing
Wait, wasn't Freya cursed? Like, she can't fight, not even to protect herself, so she chose to live in isolation. Hmm?
I always said I would buy any/every console for the right game. This is that game
Freya Is gonna put the valkyrie to shame  in this game
How much I wish, the Thor in G.O.W Ragnarok would've been voiced by Chris Hemsworth
So can't farking wait!!!!
Why the Frick would you thumbs this down?!🤯
Fabulous 🤩🤩🤩
Just a friendly reminder that Kratos still his has wife and daughter's ashes on his skin.
who is the last girl?
I will never regret this 17 year journey in my life. Kratos always brought the best out in me.
GAROTOOO
man cant wait to play it on my ps5 wait I cant even find one
This is hype like really hype
Those horns and brass playing when TYR stands up make me want to offer my arm so he doesn’t have to.
I need this game🎮
Is your level and upgrades in GOW4 is still in GOWR
The polar express girl is back😂
Boy
I really liked how Kratos Immediately said no to Atreus/Loki when said to think like a general. Because he did back in his home world, and that got him no where in the Greek world.
"Are you coming with us?"  "No, you are coming with me"
💡 Please change the camera angle to 3rd person, or something. It's hard to see what enemies are doing without constantly relying on indicators, constant thumbstick movement like its FPS or that side kick screaming LOOK OOOOOUT! Plus bring back the wild combat, jumping etc. Feeling rewarded for actual skills still matters to some.
Do not kill Kratos!!!!!!
30fps garbage. I'll wait for the PC version.
1:42  I’m hung up by Atreus walking in this part, his walk animation looks like it’s tied to a camera like kratos torso tracking the camera as he walks. Could this be a clue we might play as Atreus later?
When does this come  out
The pest wopen for me is the playdes
Can we play this on ps4? I hope so
Tbh i only whatched this to hear atreus voice
I will buy a Ps5 for this game, then sell it........unless Bloodborne 2.
Let's go, the last war.
7.3k Xbox fans disliked this video.
1:48 quien se dió cuenta de que atreus está peleando con algo parecido a las espadas del caos 🖤😎
It would be dope if we got mjolnir as a usable weapon
Y para PS4?
Se viene la madre de todas las guerras, preparen sus armas y afinen sus habilidades,este juego será un hito en la Historia
If you look closely, the moment kratos meets tyr and when he stand up are in 2 different places, maybe we will have to fight him before he agreed to join us, maybe....
I wonder how they will handle climbing in this game, would be funny to see teen atreus still climbing on papa's back
only on ps5?
Still rewatching!! Can’t wait!!!!
3:05  Chinese?
I never get enough of seeing Kratos feed body shots to a Centaur.
2:25
I forgot that Kratos was pretty short in previous saga, which makes sense that Tyr kinda taller than him
Why is there a black person on Norse mythology?  Diversity hire?
In the last game Freya was looking for her warrior spirit and I guess she found it
Why only PS5? Angry
This seems like a rehash of their characters arcs in 4
But why only on ps5 and not 4 and 5
I hope nothing terrible happens to Freya. She’s still clearly in pain. Her need for vengeance is misplaced. It’s as Mimir said, “The world’s a better place with her alive.
Esperar a salir de la pobreza para poder comprar el PS5 y jugar semejante obra de Arte🔥🔥🔥
FUUUUUUU$$$$$$$$$$$KK!  yes!
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" ....... *Rage of Sparta Plays* .......  *O*
Best one
Supeeeeer
E
We better have the Blades of chaos in this one.
Is coming on ps4 & ps5 next year 2022 for sure ✊
Kratos looks so old
❤❤❤
Looking forward to play this in 3 to 5 years
when is this coming out ?
👀🤯🤯🤯
Mejor juegos de todos y por su historia
When is it coming out??
Best franchise hands down. I'm a day 1. 💯 LFG  Can't wait  !!!!
Is it goin to be on ps4 or just on the ps5?
Man when can I pre-order?
Thor: are you a calm and resonable person?  Kratos: I do not know
I have a bad feeling about this GOW chapter...
It looks like a dlc tbh :/
7.3k downvotes from salty xbots
They bring hurcules back
The *Boy* is a *Big Boy* now
LETS GOOOOOOO
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
👀👀👀👀
Thor - “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos - “I don’t know, how bout you ask your sons and Baldur”
Algorithm.
The boy isn’t a boy anymore
Just take my money
You will always be a monster
I can't stop rewatching this
Is atreus gonna bang some chicks finally
oooooooooh
what time is coming ??
I really don’t get those nasty 👎👎 dislike  . It look and play gorgeous. . Looking forward playing it soon . Santa Monica 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Am i the only one who like the trailer before even watching it? 😂
Legends waiting for kratos vs thor
available for PS4?
Zendaya is in everything
Thor to kratos: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos : Visit your half brother(Baldur) in hel and ask him
Gives me shitton of goosebumps, the game looks so much more definitive.
I'm going to enjoy beating Thor to death with his own hammer.
Ohhh I can not weat to play Ragnarok
از نظر من دیگر بازی مثل خدای جنگ دو به وجود نخواهد آمد با اینکه چهارده سال از ساخت بازی خدای جنگ دو می گذرد هنوز هم از این نسخه های جدیدش هزاران برابر بهتر است
چه بلایی سر اون کریتوس قدرتمند و جوان آوردید چرا پیرش کردید چرا بهش یه بچه چسبوندید چرا نزاشتید که کوری بارلوگ نسخه سوم به بعد رو کارگردانی کنه چرا داستان نسخه چهارم رو طوری ساختید که پیره و بچه داره اگه جوان بود بجای اینکه یک سری از طرف دار هاشو از دست بده طرفدارهای بیشتری هم پیدا می کرد
Seeing this trailer was more exciting then Botw2
Kratos' next stop is ancient Egypt where he will be battling Ra and Anubis the egyptian gods.
Will it be on ps4pro ?????
WHY KRATOS HOLDS THE ASHES OF HIS WIFE IN HIS BELT?
kratos stay being my dad with all his convicting dialogue ... "in moments of crisis ... "
i just keep watching this
Here's to it being released early 2022. With elden ring.
I guess it should be called gods of war now.
Mimir got eye back?
It's really sad that Freya will now be an enemy instead of an ally because of the events in the previous game.
I am responsible of 2 mill views of this
*Atreus* : So tell me who are the Greek gods?Can we visit sometime? *Kratos* : *who were *Atreus* : What? *Kratos* : What??
The next Game of the Year nomines!
Since the trailer is out, everyone talks about Kratos, Thor & Tyr.  But I only want to know one thing. Does Bork knows what his donkey’s name yet?
0:19 this kinda foreshadowing  that the horns represents loki's helm... well sort of
I am loving it
Please let atreus kill a bear
I AM MOIST
Was that Faye at the end?
🤤
What's a centaur doing here?
I'm honestly interested if Thor is overpowering Kratos in this one. Kinda expecting that to happen tbh. GoW 4 made it obvious that Baldur only stood his ground against Kratos because he was immortal most of the time, but on the other hand Thor is depicted as the strongest of the gods in nearly every medium. However it is teased, that he is not al all the smartest. It would be very interesting and compelling to see Kratos win because of tactical advandatge dispite being physically inferiour. All while kicking Thors a** of course.
Are we going to see other figures from Norse mythology? Maybe Sif? And hopefully end the trilogy with killing Odin?
If this is gonna be anything like GoW 4 I'm all for it.
im so hyped man
In the end there will be a chaos
If you put you're speed on 0.50 in 1:50 you see atreus is fighting with fire blades
우와
AHH IM SO EXCITTEDDD!!!
Do you guys think the Valkyries will help us?
Man the antlers forshadowing Atreus’ powers
Netflix???
I watch it at least once every day.
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!"  Kratos: Press L3 and R3 to activate Spartan Rage
Wait it's already that long since this came out?
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  *suddenly the Ghost of Zeus pops out of the weeds* IM GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE!!!
Apart from all theories ..We all know no matter what ,Kratos won't allow anything literally anything harm His Son....Whatever it takes❤💥
This fr bout to break the Internet 😭
All I wanna see is Thor and kratos fight each other on the back of the snack and then go to Egypt
TIME: 3.35AM BEST TIME TO REWATCH GOW RAGNAROK TRAILER .. 😂❤️
Can this game play in ps4
Thr blades of chaos?!
wow so that game is coming up as well
É a 50° vez que vejo kkkkkkk
how the combat is in step with the music beats is SO satisfying XD
Still rewatching 😂😂😂😂
Fenrir: *Woofs* Atreus/Loki: Oh no , Don't woof. Fenrir: Woof!
Why do I hear zer0 jump  from borderlands 0:30
I just got a PS5 this weekend. I'M READY FOR THIS
This is going to be epic
Since I don't see anyone else asking it. 1:49 To 1:52 is that atreus smacking around enemies with his bow or his own little blades of chaos.
A
Why that stupid boats again?
need more trailer 😂
منو متحمس للجزء الجديد🔥🔥
🤩
Best Game Ever
when tyr stood up oh my lord kratos looking like a baby
Who’s the black girl?
I can do this all day
I think we all bought the play 2, play 3, play 4 and in the future the 5 to play this saga say it we go
It would be nuts if this one was as graphic as the originals
Last part of north mythology. Fighting Thor, Odin, freya, fenris Wolf,  midgard snake etc.... this title will be amazing!
Notable clip in this video: Freya physically attacking Kratos. She was cursed by Odin to never be able to harm any living creature. Did she get the curse removed by Odin? I'm intrigued.
"No matter how many gods fall, there will always be another to stand against you"  "They will fall as well"
The music in the back is just completes the trailer its so amazing
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person." Ohhhh how wrong you are. 😬
I clicked faster than kratos  can say boy
BRUH!!!
Hey in Ragnarok, doesn't Loki and Tyr simultaneously stab each other?
"start thinking like a general" Does his son know what kratos did as a general in the old days? 😂
1:56 I see Kratos loss Blades of Chaos?
It's really sunny for ragnarok
great last shot. norse mythology, diversity, yay!!....
Diversity!
•I JUST WANNA ANSWERS •
I cant wait for this game
This looks awesome, can't wait to play
SO EXCITED TO SEE ANGRBODA, LOKI’S MATE AND MOTHER OF MONSTERS! THIS MEANS WE WILL BE SEEING GIANTS, wherever they’ve disappeared to!!! And oooh imagine a little bit spark romance between them, since Atreus is definitely going thru puberty here. Kratos just awkward dad third wheeling in the back. AND IMAGINE WE GIVE BOY THE TALK! Kratos will have many new things to worry about 🤣
I can't wait to see how cocky Atreus is gonna get in this game.
What bothers me is that jackcepticeye has not taken notice of this.
Kratos war cry is forever GOATED.
Kratos war cry is forever GOATED.
so only on ps5 im guessing
Rewatching this trailer is so addicting.
I literally just bought my PS5 for this game
Tear I chose to keep that door shut for a reason kratos
Boy you are the start and end to this war
Atreus: Maybe we should fight gods Kratos: No. We'll never fight gods. Actually, I will kill all gods just to make extra sure we don't have to fight them.
Hope we get to play as Tyr
How old is Atreus now?
Yo can anybody help me who was the black girl at the end of the trailer should I know who that is?
Se o Thor martelar a Careca do Kratos, será que o Martelo Racha ??🤔🤔
Kratos didn't ask for an angsty teen
Atreus: stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general! Kratos PTSDeity intensifies
Kratos will fight hippo
just keep atreus away from horses......
Thor:   Are you a calm and reasonable person..?  Meanwhile Kratos:   Who slaughtered All greek gods even titans and even thor sons and and his brother….  The Answer For Thor Is Yes
the Playstashon at the end is lolic
The next season, probably Kratos fighting Guan Yu in China
I screamed without the s
Amazing game
3:06 who is  the girl?
I need the official trailer now!
1:55 I see Kratos loss Blades of Chaos
1:47 Take that BattleToads
Чёрная Ангербода,у северных народов,серьезно Сони??? Вы расисты,в угоду черным!!!
Tyr still whole.......for now *whistles for dog*
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General!" After this there must be a flashback lasting for 3 games.
Dislikes are from xbox fans and fortnite kids 😂
3:00
Looking like they’re gonna keep up the high expectations on this insanely epic franchise. Thumbs up to the developers 👍👍👍👍
E P I C N E S S
Santa Monica hats off
Kratos:are u coming with us tyr tyr:yes boy
And then, Kratos will add Odin's head to his collection 🤣🤣
very addictive trailer and i love it🔥
That 7.1k dislikes are from Xbox gamers
These nuts are calm and reasonable
Well, we all know how Kratos' family ended up when he acted a general...
DROOLS
Thor:you seem like a calm and reasonable person  Kratos:don't know ask your son's  😂
So no one gonna talk about how Mimir was painting with his mouth
Thor:Are you a calm and reasonable person? Dude literally destroy the whole pantheon along with the civilisation in the name of revenge lol
Boi of war 😅
Why is there no boi??
People who deslike are just crazy
Bro there is 5 days im waching this as cycle juste when when
Does anyone know if they will make it for PS4?
sooo did they really just switch from greek mythology to Norse??
Thor looking more like "Fat" Sheamus than Hemsworth are the small details of portrayed accuracy that make me super excited about this game. Can't wait.
this gonna be on ps4 right
i watched it 28 times
I feel like everyone is watching this after the showcase
1:51 Me: Now thats character development
11/10 stuff
That Tyr reveal was pretty cool... gotta hand it to em
Mhm, I'm still rewatching☠
Jmo but tier looks like he's in jotunhiem and everybody seems to recognize loki
still watching this.  i really do hope they bring that general .. that ghost of sparta back.. perhaps they are trying to tell us something with " stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general." a little more brutalities like the ogs wouldn't hurt.  p.s i love how the alligator enemy grabs you then does a death roll and then slams you.. thats attention to detail right there.
If I don’t see Kratos make Thor hit himself in the face with Mjolnir at least once, I’m gonna cry
Please do not kill off Kratos. The series must end with him still alive.
Do not kill Kratos
"are you a calm and reasonable person" He was so blinded by revenge he didn't think about traveling back in time and saving his family he instead just wanted to own Zeus at literally the worst moment he could have picked out of spite
Atreus is Loki
PlayStation Is this game also available on PS4?
Old kratos: ZOOOOOS!!! cooler Kratos: THOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!
:V
I wonder if the chick at the end is gonna have to do with the Egyptian pantheon.
Little note the girl at the end is a Jotunn that married Loki aka Atreus
Never end of keots jarni
3:06 I'm gonna place a bet that she's going to get a bunch of hate for absolutely no reason, and if my prediction is right, I'm going to be sorely disappointed in the people who play this game
The PS5 bundle will be sold on in 5minutes
I like that atreus is wearing kratos spartan robe. At 0:56
Awesome! Ohh nooo. I bought a series x for this generation and sold  my PS4 pro.
I love how Kratos hears Atreus' footsteps in the opening scene. The look on his face shows he NEVER lets his guard down.
Kratos: Where is tyr? Boy: In the direction of tyr 😏
2:07 that line made me bought gow 3 and show how kratos is a "calm and a reasonable person"
Thor: trying to kill kratos The entire gow community: you're not the guy Thor trust me you're not that guy.
So tyr is alive! How come I never knew that?
Sorry, Angrboda is from where exactly?
I hope the girl at the end was Sigyn! Would be awesome!
Eu queria ps5 meu aniversário ta chegar
Are you guys more looking forward to fighting Thor or Odin?
Bitcoin +Dogecoin buy. ..
When release
i want it now!!!
I've got a strong feeling that this will be GTOY. It just has all the potential for an all-time classic much like the previous game.
Wow, dialogue seems really on point for a GOW game. Going back to your roots I see?
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General!"  *Welcome to This Is Your Life, Kratos! Lets start by revisiting the part of your life where you were thinking like a General.*
Every Time in the Gym. When i pick a Fight with Gods
Calm and reasonable, standing in front of you, has wipe out a whole civilization and their Gods
Single dad tries to save the world with his antique collection
Time treval kratos.... yung is hear
Sick!!!
2:16 Can’t wait to call the axe back 5 million more times after throwing it. Who else?  I also love this 2:04
0:22 I thought it was Loki
Ok I’m NOT selling my PS4 now
Just when you thought video games had peaked … this looks like another PS exclusive masterpiece 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
jeez I'm so exited!!!!
If this game doesn’t take a week for me to complete I don’t want it 😂😂
2:00 2:00 2:00 2:00

One of mine and Jason's favourite childhood games so glad he's gotten to work not only on number 4 but now number 5!!! Amazing🥰😍😍
Wow so amazing can’t wait
This a must cop🔥🔥🔥
i’m SO EXCITED WHAJAIIFJFR
يهو بيومي معاهم باللعبه 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒-??????????????
THOR     :"are you a calm and a resonable person ?" KRATOS : read the tile on the game disk boi
😍😍
I come back here. Oh Gods i really need this game
I'm noticing a suspicious lack of "boi"
So, did they even add any new mechanics to the combat system? It just looks like a few extra moves. Did anything change at all?
KRATOS : IF I CANT TAKE UR HAMMER AND SMASH IT THEN I WILL TAKE U AND SMASH UR HAMMER WITH U BOIII!!!
Can't wait 😎
I’m willing to bet those wolves pulling that sled will be the same wolves chasing the sun and moon. And that it will be the winter version of the boat rides
Oh yea baby we going to asgard!!
PLS RELEASE IT ON PS4 TOO😖😖
amazing as always
day 4 of commenting here until ragnarok launches, ragnarok still hasn't launched. Nothing noteworthy happened today
I haven’t seen anyone talking about it but who is the girl at the end supposed to be ??
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Thor in his mind: "Please say yes please please please"
(Comment stolen for I couldn’t find the original one): Since Angrboda is in the game, I imagine Kratos will have to give Atreus “the Talk”.
*thor coming to kill kratos*  the entire GOW fanbase: "your not that guy pal"
Could this only be played in ps5?
I love how the part with atreus walking to the Cave with deer is reverse of kratos walking into the house from the last game
GIVE IT TO ME JUST GIVE IT TO ME
Im pre-ordering this fo sho!!
I like how tear looked down at kratos. Like obviously he never met kratos.
im calling it, game of the decade
They'll probably kill off Kratos and have that be Loki reasoning in starting Ragnarok.
Dog of War 1:12
Ooh, I’m psyched for this!
Straight goosebumps @2:52🥶
Anyone else seeing Atreus using blades of chaos at 1:45?
Who is that that stands up
3:04 WE
I am here from the future to tell you all that this game is a masterpiece
im really having a bad feeling that atreus is going to be annoying here. pretty sure he will mess up big time like he was on previous one
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general.  Kratos: NO!  The thing is, the reason why Kratos sounded so firm and even a little emotional there is because he did exactly that once before: When he stopped thinking like a father and started thinking more like a general of Sparta, it led him down the road that would cause him to kill his family and the Greek pantheon.
Boi: hits puberty and acts rebelliously Kratos: *pulls out The Belt of Chaos*
bro im getting the ps5
Kratos has transformed from the poster-boy of toxic masculinity into a respectable depiction of healthy masculinity.  He's far from a perfect father, but he's really learning to be better.
Mimir is my favourite character, and remains the best rendition of the "talking fairy" video-game trope ever devised.
This was supposed to drop on my birthday, but sadly it got delayed.  I don't even care about the price tag or a release date now.  All I want for Christmas is a pre-order date.
My main question is this: If Thor and Odin were so enraged and clearly coming for you after killing their kin, why does it take years for them to finally get to hunting you? (My theory is that Odin is aware of Kratos, and knows that directly facing him is pointless)
Am I really going to have to buy a PlayStation ._.
Mother of Ns
Hey y'all... I searched google and I saw that in Norse mythology.. Loki will marry angrboda during Ragnarok or after it ends
7.2k dislikes for what reasons this trailer is godly
“ZEUS! I bring with me the destruction of Olympus!” ~ a Calm and Reasonable Person
Every time I start seeing GOW: Ragnarok content, I end up back to the trailer to rewatch it 😂 can’t wait for this!!
I feel like Odin will kill Kratos which drives Loki to want to kill Odin. Atreus will have a son and he will be named Fenrir and I think that Fenrir will be the next character we play as after Atreus. Just my thought on how I think this will play out 😊
Let's kill THOR..!!!
This game is the reason  thats why i am buying the ps 5
day 3 of commenting here until ragnarok launches, ragnarok still hasn't launched but metroid dread looks really sweet, I'm gonna pick it up when it comes out
Ninja theory is cool (Dante)
Ninja theory is cool
Who was that boii taller than kratos tell mee
Thor, you're next!
Maza aayega biduuu !!!
I love this game
I don't remember but didn't they mention that Tyr had lost a hand in the last game? Shouldn't this one be missing one then?
This is gonna be epic. One issue. They forced a new character in the game strictly for the globalist diversity agenda. That African chick was not needed
2:47------1.50 tall girl says you are short  2:51-----You stand up
I am replaying gow at the Moment and the most interesting Thing about the Trailer for me is that Freya is fighting Kratos. Since she was cursed by odin to never fight again they must have reconciled somehow after Baldur's death.
I know that everyone is making funny comments about Thor's dialogue are u a calm and reasonable person and i find it funny too but lemme remind u thor is going to be much and much stronger than we are thinking of. We are thinking that kratos will rip off his head but lemme tell u that he is at least 10 times stronger than Baldur and in this game, maybe atreus aka BOI will go against kratos and that will be his biggest challenge and whereas about tyr. I think tyr will betray kratos. So my man is all himself and we all agree that kratos isnt much stronger as he was in gow3 or other previous games so maybe he will get that strong again in this game at the end of the game.
Is it only me or Tyr resembles a bit of Keanu Reeves
Music is amazing
Alright guys let’s do this
Teehee
3:05 please change the character please. You have 2 years time to release the game please change the black girl or this itself brings a bad mark to this game. All are perfect. But the one big thing only. 🙏PLEASE 🙏
I'm hyped for this dlc 😂
1:57
All muslims
I mean yeeeeh but noooo.  I have mixed feelings about this. Its gives different vibes from GoW4.
This… does put a smile on my face
I literally get goosebumps everytime I hear kratos. "In moments of crisis panic does nothing!"
2:51
02:23 Dudes....this isn't the gruff lovable father speaking to his son. This IS what we've seen for so long. This is what Kratos has been doing, while killing all those Gods, Monsters, and other beings. It's kinda surreal, to see this "Video game" character that we knew for so long, explain his mind AFTER his original games.
Yep, here it goes, another 80 dollars, but, guess what, I do not give a fk because this masterpiece is worth every cent in my pocket
Give me the game or I’ll stop the world right now!
Thor: *Tries to kill Kratos while getting really to take his hammer. Hercules's face wrapped with bandages: "Don't, he will take your hammer and smash your face in."
Don't mind me just watching this trailer for the 50th time
1:16 Odin’s two Ravens, Huginn and Muginn
Just finished the game on ps4 again and seen the trailer, it's even better
WHERE'S OUR BOY JÖRMUNGANDR

day 2 of commenting here until ragnarok launches, ragnarok still hasn't launched but I did learn dual wielding in gow 2018
Wish we'd seen a glimpse of 'Spartan Rage available'
7k dislikes. Tf is going on????? Ooooooooh ok, I see... angrboda. Amazing how nobody ever talks about brok being blue. *EDIT* Before u bring up broke disease remember one thing, Brok was shown in the release trailer as a blue man.
“you seems like a calm and a reasonable person" “Are you a calm and a reasonable person kratos:why Thor:cause I don't wanna fight you
7k dislikes are from fortnite kids
Unm people are talking this and that but everyone forgetting the last mural on giants fall the death of kratos . And there are few hints to it also.
Whose here for the 20th time watching this again 😭😭😭😭😭
Can we see Jormungandr around the lake of nine ?
2:07
"Start thinking like a general"  tf Atreus?
This game is available for ps4 or not please help me
*Are you a calm & Reasonable Person..*       *(L3+R3)*
yoooo
The way tyr stood up with his glowing eyes like mimirs, yea chills everywhere 💪🏽 let’s go!!!!
Atreus:"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!" Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "NO!"
I can’t wait to see a fire giant because if you know you know mimir said that we will not see a fire giant until ragnarok
Boy has grown!
E3 DEMO
Let's goo
I believe I am familiar with the artist. lol
They need to drop the game, j can’t wait anymore
can’t even wait
Eventually, Kratos will have wandered around the world killing the gods until he's destroyed the concept of religion entirely.
Marvel were mocking Thor’s weight gain in Avengers End Game while this is what he should be looking like, the dude is known for his huge appetite and you think he’s gonna have dashing abs?  Props to the game for being as meticulous as they are concerning each character looks & design
crying has xbox user
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Oh yeah, lemme just use my Spartan Peace and Blades of Harmony!!
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?   Kratos: YeS, i aM A caLM aNd rEAsOnaBle pErsOn
I didnt understand what they showed
The fact the last game started with Atreus hunting a deer and this trailer starts with him already hunted a deer. Just Great 👏🏽
will it be available for PS4?
Looks like Aterus has got Older
Hey. PayStation. Fix your prices...
Am not going to lie, this looks like a DLC for 2018
Is it just me or the kid's voice is like Tom Holland?
Also the Warrior descending from Asgard in the trailer could be the Destroyer from the Marvel movie Thor, but just maybe
5th time
So if Odin put a spell on Freya saying she couldn't kill anything, then why is Freya tryna kill Kratos Physically???
I'am so shocked that Tyr is ALIVE and he will help Kratos and Atreus, or maybe not.
They should get Anthony Hopkins or the guy from American Gods to voice Odin
Some of these lines sound very weird.
I don’t know how many times I’ve rewatched this.
"you seems like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?" I don't know why but I think this is Tyr's line, not Thor.
1:15  "Odin's got tricks up his sleeve we haven't dared to consider."  There are two ravens in the shot. Odin has a pair of ravens, Huginn and Muninn, that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to him.  Maybe Odin is watching their every move and might even be tricking them by using Tyr. Since Tyr was suspiciously not well chained and has both eyes, considering how big of a threat to Odin he is. Remember that Mimir was imprisoned in an indestructible tree and has one eye plucked and personally tortured by Odin. Mimir said that Odin has _no end to his creativity_ when torturing him everyday.  Also Odin is too paranoid with Ragnarok and obsessed with knowledge that he even sacrificed his eye. Surely he has eyes on everyone, everywhere since Baldur's death.
i  bet you that the guy with the squid is odin in disguise
Those music / hit synchs are incredible.
Does it support on ps4 plz can some one tell me
Must play game🔥
Thor-Are you a calm and resonable person Kratos-L3    +     R3
Thor: *Comes to kill Kratos*  Zues: *Well I tried*
I think they gut that we want a gow and not a boi picken flowers
Thats super dope 👌
THOR: ARE YOU A CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON? KRATOS: YOU COULDN'T CACTH A COLD!!!!
Well then, there goes the Kratos = Tyr theory
beastboyshub needs to play this
commenting here till gow ragnarok launches  Day 1: Gow ragnarok has not launched yet but I have been grinding in gow 2018 lately
I wasn’t really a fan of the games until I played the third one. I didn’t touch the 2018 one until I saw this trailer. I went back and played that one and absolutely fell in love with the franchise and now I super excited for this one
LET’S F**KING GOOOOOO!!!!!!
OMFG TYR IS ALIVE!!!!!!!
I swear his axe is so freaking cool 😭
I can't wait to use Mjölnir⚡
Cant play
I feel like its the 1first hour
1:35 axe are in the sword
Wonder if we’ll be fighting more dragons and maybe some sea monsters in this one.
Like many others I can't wait for this! Unlike the rest of the disgusting fan base that show no empathy or sympathy for the reason it was delayed you should all be ashamed of yourselves Christopher Judge sorry to hear about your ailments and I wish you a speedy recovery my heart is with you and your family take all the time you need, this game is going to be phenomenal when it's out
My boi Atreus made the wrong move asking his dad KRATOS to stop talking like a dad and more like a general
Yes i watch this trailer 10th time
Huh, I wonder if they're making Angrboda with Egyptian origins? Like how they wrote Mimir to be Celtic?
Who keeps coming back just to rewatch this 3min trailer?
الله
No way is Calliope in this game
I can't wait until this game to come long time coming I'm pre-ordering me to copies of this game for the Playstation 5
The sons nose is jarring. All I'm going to say
When will they make this game a movie
Thanos, Saitama, This guy... Man what's wrong with this bald dudes?
Boy
Kratos back to putting in work, only means he gets stronger.
2:44
aaaaa😩😩😩😫😫😫😫😫 the ragnarok coming i cant wait. but wait. i have only ps 4:(
Time to put some vacation days in when this bad boy comes out
Of course ReviewBrah's dad is Kratos, it all makes sense now.
Little cousin: hey isn't that Kratos from fortn... Me: 1:57
What platform are you? PS4 like PS5 comment
I had to log into my YouTube account to watch this lol
Does the Game comes only for PS5 or for PS5 and PS4? I Hope it comes for both
The hype here is overwhelming.
Thor : you seem like a calm and a reasonable person. Are you a calm and a reasonable person?  Ares😂, Poseidon😅, Helios😁, Hercules😋, Hermes🤣, Hera☺️, Hephaestus😆, Cronos😄, Gaia🤭 Zues: Bahahahahahahahahahaha😅😄😆🤣🤭🙃😅😂
"you need to stop acting like a father and more like a genera-"  Boi.... Did you forget what kratos revealed about his past?
Since Tyr has both his arms I wouldn't be surprised if Fenrir makes a boss fight appearance
"I've looked at it for five hours now."
Two gods of war joining forces? Oh dear gods…
Love the music as always.
Blades of chaos vs Mjolnir  Blade of Olympus vs Odin's spear
April 20th 2022 release date will be perfect
7k dislikes xbots malding
Lol Kratos about to slaughter another group of gods
I have a feeling thor will try to brainwash Atreus, to the point he may shockingly betray his father.
Yoo I rewatched this a few times and it was on my most recent watch that I realized Atreus was WILDIN' in the background of these fights. Little man is coming into his own
Looks like they made Arteus even more whiney and irritating. Snivelling little baby.
I'm so excited for this. All 9 realms explorable, Thor, Odin, Tyr... All on new hardware to boot... What's not to like? Now if only I could get my hands on a ps5.....
Still rewatching
Please I want this game on PS4 also 😭😓🙏🙏🙏🙏
Stupid kids does nothing but mooning and leaves all the fight to the father
So stunning 😀❤️👍
Ragnarok is here boi
2:12 is that someone coming through the bifrost?
"War is not the only way , boi" Lol , Coming from Kratos 😂
Santa Moniccccccccca ! I Love You 😍😍😍
How is Freya able to attack kratos?
I actually bought the consoles just for this game, seems like I'm going to buy another one 🔥🤘
I will not buy this game. Sane white people, don't feed these leftist
But any guess when will it come?????
The boy who seem like,Tintin animation movie boy....
lets face it the norse gods were more sensible than the greeks, why become a 40 foot giant humanoid and become an easy target when you can be 7 feet tall or less and still wreck people only this time your not that big a target
Yeah a sorry to say but like take all of my money
Why is no one talking about Kratos and Atreus badass walk towards their enemies
I mean thor is my favorite avenger and all but I WILL PICK KRATOS TO WIN 20/10 times if they clash.
This game is gonna carry Sony ps4/5
2:52 Kratos is a 7 foot tall man. That is basically Shaq next to Tyr
Atreus: *disrespects his father* Kratos: Do you know whose ashes these are on my skin, boy?
I feel like out of 8 millions, two of them should be only me. I can's stop watching this.
That girl at the end i can guarantee will be Atreus’ love interest
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Greek gods: 😬😬😬
Again and again game of all time
Please let in be on ps4😩
Now if only this would release on steam.
"in moments of crisis panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you" maybe that's Kratos teaching boy how to use spartan rage
3:04 Nizzer.......... disappointed icecream eating man
2:29
2:16
2:38
At this point I’ve already memorized every word.
in an ideal world we would want kratos to get thors hammer but don’t think that’s gonna happen, would be sick if atreus wields it
is that zeus? wth 😱😱😱
Looks like a DLC instead of a sequel.
re watching the trailer just in case i missed something the last 30 times i watched it
When is this going to be released?
So I’m guessing after we beat the Norse gods, are we going to the Egyptians next or???
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: *throws axe*
2:54  How girls see 5'11 and 6ft
I’m turned on now
Em relação à plataforma de investimento, comprar VIPs para ganhar uma renda extra,
Freyas not doing so hot lol
goodbye zeus armor hello random armor
I thought Tyr was big until I went back and watched that Hercules fight on GOW III. I wish Kratos still had his wings
Thor just wants to know if they have anything to drink.
"In moments of crisis panic does nothing. Harness it, let it serve you."- Kratos 2021
Does it come in ps4?
I’m happy atreus is getting a big part in this
Hyped bro I am gonna cop this!
maldade pura com o pobre fã da saga gow q n tem dinheiro pra comprar um ps5
Jejak
quite simply from the 2 shouts Freya is giving near the beginning of the trailer, i can tell she's gonna be outstanding
Thor: are you a Calm and reasonable person Kratos: *Rips his sons face in half*
Kratos - Bring me THOR!!!  Thor - He's trying to copy me.
GET YOU A PS5 PEOPLE 🔥🥵
Who come's to just see the hammer
I’m watching this trailer every week😂
“Odin! Loki the last of the Giants has arrived I bring the destruction of Asgard!” If Atreus screams this like Kratos screamed it to Zeus…GOTY
Did they change Brok's voice?
Ninja theory is cool - Dante

Kratos has really come a long way
Can't wait to kill thor
I’m so ready for this Masterpiece!!! Check my channel to see me clap some Valkyrie cheeks!!
Coulda just made this a $60 dlc  The Ragnarok dlc lol
lol
For some reason I feel like  Kratos life will be ended by he's son just thinking I mean we don't know what will happen in prophesy 😐
Kratos must face his toughest challenge yet: raising a teenager as a single father
it would be cool to see kratos fight egyptian gods haha
How does Kratos only have one child? Considering that he literally banged every willing female he has ever come across?
Love how they had to shoehorn their token black character at the end...
I will go crazy if Kratos is able to wield both leviathan axe in one hand and mjolnir in the other.
Now all I need is a shave! To bring my old self back!!
Nobody be picking a fight with Tyr tho he can probably dunk from the 3 point line
I watch this every day 🔥🔥
Are we sure its Thor's voice?
I can't wait
Que padre que metan cosas religiosas por ejemplo Jesucristo como Tyr.
Yeah, Don't mind me☝😅 ..just here for another Rewatch! 💪😍👌
Muh strong african women Norse gods
Espero que no jodan esta historia metiendo su agenda progre , porque estoy seguro que los nórdicos no eran negros…  Pd me suda que digan que soy racista , ya que no lo soy y no lo fui en este comentario.
Esperandolo para mi play 5 wuuu juuu :3
А негры там откуда !??
Me crying in Xbox
Tbh I miss the over the top violence , more blood and guts please
That's it I'm naming my son KRATOS
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Ever heard of the Greek Pantheon?  Thor: No  Kratos: Exactly
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: I don't know, ask Zeus
Hey Sony can you remaster the soul sacrifice delta? Pls
i just want to play it already >:(
Norse mythology is garbage and Vikings are just overrated fishermen who lived in huts and preyed upon priests and villsgers
I need this music...
"Are you coming with us?" "No."  The End.
Prediction: He’s gonna pull out blade of Olympus to fight Odin
I hope they make a cameo for the last Spartan
Duuuuuude!
Ninja theory is cool

I just hope that valkyries are still a side mission and not a main boss.
יש פה בישראל גור הגוד אוף וור החדש תראה מה הולך קיבינימט
It will come in ps4 or not
Freya attacks kratos. Le kratos: boii,meet ya new mum.
y como para cuando ?... dieron fecha?.saludos?
Freya really held a grudge against kratos killing her son who was gone kill her in the process? what kinda backwards logics that is?
Yes I'm still watching this again and again
0:24 insert vine boom
Who’s all here after seeing Christopher Judges post about why the same was delayed
its seen so boring
this trailer is cool I can't wait to play it!
They should definitely bring back the tap circle system when you pull chains and lift doors, etc.
Its possible thor destroyed their house and live in the cave
1:33 🤔
we don't know if Kratos will survive this time ... but one thing is for sure ... in the end ... there will be only CHAOS
Why can't i pre-order it already ???
You have to deserve a game like this
graet game of all time🔥
Just got my ps5 last night let's goooo I'm ready
I'm excited just like you!
Yep, watching this like 5 times a week or so
This is a BIG W
i hope this game wont be dissapointed as the 2018 game
It's real. Tyr will be Troy Baker??? Hahaha.
Kratos have been accused of many things in his life. But never have he been accused of being calm or reasonable.  I hope there is going to be so many boss battels against the nordic gods its gonna be Ragnarok
Hopefully we have a jump button
This game feels so lonely. It's like everyone is the enemy...
Why is kratos in a cave 0:29
I came for my daily view
Question is , will Kratos be able to lift Thor’s hammer , and if he’s not worthy just lift the planet itself 🤔🤔
Pure garbage woke, changing the races
Pure garbage woke, changing the races
Pure garbage woke, changing the races
Pure garbage woke, changing the racesP
This is gonna probably gonna be game of the year
The camera direction looks kind of weird and sloppy. Is it just me?
Pure garbage woke, changing the races
Honestly it kinda hurts seeing so many fans of the game complain about the girls skin color being african american nerd myself it's a let down
Imagine baldur saying to Tyr "I thought you'd be bigger🤣🤣🤣
The scene in which Atreus says "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" Kratos does not have the blades of chaos "STRANGE"
Xbox: I am sorry Kratos: do not be sorry be better
This trailer was the best birthday present im still watching
I got only 10MB Data Left ! So I try to switch at 144p. Then my internet provider said keep it at 1080p This Trailer deserved it. We will adjust it
Kratos and Atreus did kill Thor's sons. Just sayin' he might be justified in being angry.
REVEAL TRAILER
I gotta buy a ps5 now
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
I Re-watched this atleast twice everyday since the reveal and I'll probably keep doing so till the next trailer or release
Nice last-gen graphics.
I'm here again

If you compare this Thor scene with the one from gow4 you can see that Atreus is bigger which means that actually happens
When Atreus say's: stop acting like a father for me and start acting like a general.   Me was like: haaaa😂😂😂😂  trust me BOOY!!!  You don't want to. The last time i saw kratos became a general he wipe out the entire Greek gods and goddesses.😂😆
Thor: Why is there a circle above my head? Kratos: Why indeed...
I love how mimir was chilling like nothing
Where are people getting Thors face reveal from??
Time for kratos to have a new title in norse "Ragnarok"
Will this be on ps4? Or only on ps5?
Every single day I woke up and I watch this video.... I dont know but I love to start my day watching this.... Kratos is just not a gameplay character for me, he is more than that...
did anyone notice the book mimir is reading, that could be atreus's notebook from last game
Ya know it was always funny hearing Baldur say "I thought you'd be bigger.." at the beginning of GoW4 when Kratos is taller than him, but after seeing Tyr I see why Baldur would've thought Kratos was taller than he actually is.
I keep coming back😭
The destroyer of worlds is back ( zeus words ) my hype surpassed the mount olympus again!
The destroyer of worlds is back ( zeus words ) my hype surpassed the mount olympus again!
I’ve watched this 678 times.  1 more time won’t hurt
Ngl This trailer is more badass than the Vanguard trailer reveal.
Clever way to end that
SUP BOI
Yess this means more of Mimir’s stories!
1:56 notice kratos isn’t carrying the blades of chaos. Is it possible that he’s already fought Thor at this point and with  his hammer he destroyed them? I feel like that would be a badass way to put over how powerful both Thor and his hammer really are by having him destroy kratos blades
cant stop watching this
Is the Valkyrie armor it’s going to be on lockable
That's not tyr that's Odin in disguise
2022 GOTY
Hyped as hel for the game release
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Ares and Zeus: About that....
Is it safe to say, that this is THE Kratos? I mean, the younger shouty guy was cool too, don't get me wrong. He brought us a backstory, and brought us here. But man, these new games really struck something deep
This is my 20th time watching
ITS FINALLY HERE!!!!!! :DDDDDD
The fact this has 8 million in 2 weeks just shows the hype is real. 🙌
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?  (Rage of Sparta Theme plays)
Remember when Atreus asked if they can turn into animals? Whelp, there's your answer!
Am I the only that thinks the “calm and reasonable” quote may actually have said by Tyr instead of Thor? There’s something about about the voice that screams “wise veteran” rather than “evil, hammer swinging Lummux.”
Just for ps5 oof
💪💪😬😬😬😬😬🧠🏆
Anyone else curious about the centaurs in the trailer? Originating from Greek mythology, their presence in this game is most interesting to me
Esperei tanto por isso
Kratos has fighten His Most biggest challenge, *Raising a teenage boy*
Atreus sounds like Sora from KH1
Camt believe this is the old Kratos i knew
This trailer is better than movie trailers 🤣
😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Of course i watch this trailer everyday, keeping the hype on check.
Brok: Well... What in all Jarnsmida happened to him? Atreus: Nunya... Brok: Nunya...
I'm now going to get an app that sets my GPS ti kratos
When will this game release
Thor: *are you a calm and reasonable person*    The greek pantheon: *NO* Kratos: **Sweating intensely**
I really hope Atreus doesn't make the same mistakes Kratos did.
Please have more weapons. 2 would be nice
if I have to buy the ps5 just to play this game, I gladly will I've played all the parts
why atreus sounds like tom holland?????
*L3 + R3 INTENSIFIES*
The blue orb Atreus is holding at 0:38 says HATI (name of one the wolves who chases the sun and moon)
Legends are expecting it in PS Plus library
*Tyr stands up*  Kratos hears the words of his fallen brother echoing in the back of his mind: *I will kill you for our father, call it my 13th and final labor*
Please make it for pc also
Kind of boring it seems. Very much a like the previous gen game
Can't wait for kratos to kill thor and odin
I wonder what is Freya thinking, how angry can she be to want to take 1v1 on Kratos, she knows who he is, she knows what he can do. I think she plays the "he probably is feeling guilty for killing my son so he wont be offensive" card
Wooooow i can't believe this snuck by me for 2 whole weeks.... what am I doing with my life
Kratos is now facing the toughest challenge that exists: A son's rebellious phase.
Man, does Atrues not know what he told Kratos to do, when he stated that Kratos needed to start acting like a General.
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: "No!"
dear playstation i witnessed a cheater online in fifa 22 he used a dirty cheat to ruiin me a trophy which is hard enough and then Soloniki7000 comes and used the cheat on me and i would like you to take EXTREME ACTIONS AGAINST HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dislikes are Xbox fans 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yep  take my money. I’ll buy all the merch.
Thor"you seem like a calm and reasonable person..are you a calm and reasonable person" me"ARE YOU"!!!!!!
I saw this trailer 8 times  And im still doing it 😂🙂
In moments of crisis,  Panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you.  - KRATOS
That kids voice doesn’t match to well
The girl in final ... Why i feel she and Atreus will: ⭕
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general  Kratos:Okay *5 minutes later*  Kratos has been thrown off the ship 0 imposters left
Im on my 10th rewatch of the trailer
I hope I can pet the wolves.
BOY!
I can't wait for Atreus... "Quiet, Head."
Are you a calm and reason Pearson? Kratos:🤦
Was the tall dude supposed to shock Kratos? He has slayed gods that were literally the size of mountains.
i want to modify my future cars GPS to be Kratos telling me to go right and left
Why does tyr have both hands still
Boooooy
are u a calm and reasonable person  kratos: ask gow 3 kratos😂
Really surprised and grossed out by all the racism for the girl at the end. Like ffs
I'm switching
Now if only I could get ahold of a PS5 so that I can play these games.
Fun fact: tyr is 8'5, 6 inches shorter than the tallest man in the world who was 8'11. Tyr is also an antire foot shorter then lady demitrescu who is 9'5 i beleive
let's hope the developers don't dare to kill kratos because they would ruin the whole of frankisia
Fat Eloy, Black Nords, Scary women in LU, politics, deflections under screaming minorities, what else will you surprise sony with?
Kratos is back!
Kratos: "which way do we go?"  Atreus: "In the direction of Tyr"
Prepare for the "RAGNAROK" BOI !!!!
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  The entire greek pantheon left the chat
gow > all games
Maybe for "equality" the new king of Wakanda will be white XD
i tried changing my password to Kratos and it said it was to strong.
F
song of the beginning?
Hypado d+ pra esse game 2022 promete 😁👍🇧🇷
ANGRBODA???
Time for my daily rewatch
Will this be dlc or a new game
War is not the only way
Thor -Are you a reasonable person? Kratos -what do you think malaka
6
Its true trailer
The fact that i loved about this trailer is showing that we can use a sleigh.
Ninja theory is cool - Dante
Ninja theory is cool (Dante)
Hopefully we can kill gods in this
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos: ever hear of Greece Thor: no? Kratos: exactly
Waiting for the launch
It is conming on PS4?
I got a question I have for years. So, when Kratos farts, does Mimir smelt it? If so, why didn't he say anything?
Cool
WET
You must prepare yourself🔥
Can't wait to bash thor's head with his own hammer
tyr is TALL
Man I'm so glad this isnt coming out on the playstation 5
Farbauti o bom de Guerra, e seu filho lokia
"Start thinking like a general"  Yeah that went well last time, all things considered
Ps4 ? Or just ps5 🤔🤔
Why is there black people?
*boy.*
Is this game have any connection with the Thor movie?
3:05 лол нигра
Thor : "You seem like a calm and a reasonable person"  Greek Gods : Lol... RIP
LETS GOOOOOO!!!! TYR IS HERE! WE ARE GONNA FIGHT THOR! AND ATREUS HAS GOTTEN OLDER AND HE HAS A NEW VOICE AND HE HAS A NEW HAIR! :0 AND CLOTHES! AND HE HAS TATTOOS?!
Did someone else notice how the deer´s antlers at the beginning also look like loki´s horns?
1:57
The Loki imagery is strong in this one!!
Imagine this comes out on ps4
This trailer is like jazz. It's what they don't show that's got me intrigued.
pug of war
qye gran juego
I will be waiting to get a ps5 to play this game.
Can't wait 😁😁😁
I really want to see Kratos interact with Tyr, they're two sides of the same coin if you think about it.
I like how this trailer shows so much actual gameplay instead of just cutscenes like most trailers do.
Sony is getting rid of Ps4 Like An EX! come on include Ps4 on the title of the video along with Ps5🤯
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO VANAHAIM TYR IS TAKING US TO VANAHAIM MY FRIENDS!
very underwhelming
Glad they kept Mimir dude,  perfect for the journey.
this better not only be for a console that people can't get their hands on
The bird in helheim should also be in the game 🪶
2:13 2:18
🔥
Geliyor gönlümün efendisi
wow there gonna release this ps5 exclusive on ps4?
I love how they don’t show any major boss fights in the trailer.
Ninja theory is cool
Ninja theory is cool - Dante
It’s ok we will probably get the same troll re-skinned 8 times before we see thor for one fight 😂
This is gonna be a 10/10 no cap bro expectations might be low but this is gonna be a 10/10
You Do Not Know, What Your Mother Wanted.
Watch This For The 19th Time On The Loop
“You’ll get your answers soon enough. Well some of them…” Boy I hope so… 🤦🏻‍♂️😭
This whole comment section is basically ‘tell me you’re a racist without directly saying you’re a racist’
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Thor Odinson,  Protector of mankind, Rise and meet your fate, Ragnarok awaits.
Looks great but gotta say something feels just slightly off... sadly probably wont be able to recreate a perfect narrative flow like the last one but hopefully that's just the scorned, bitter, pessimist I am.
“Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos:…… Bro I’m literally covered in *ashes*
Imagine is african mythology, turning one of their myths into a white woman...
cant wait to watch the gameplay walkthorough
0:36 this is why he looks like "Tin Tin"😂🤔
Sony need to start making some games PS5 exclusive so we at least feel like it was worth all the effort to get one. To the layman it’s hard to tell the difference from PS4 pro when your sat six ft away from your tv, Aside from loading times. I’m tempted to sell my ps5 while it’s worth a lot and go back to the pro until they start to embrace the 5.
Release date?
just imagine if Chris Hemsworth acted as Thor in the game
i canttt waittttt :PP
i’m so hyped for this game!!!! who’s with me!?
I was hoping the trailer would have “Tell Me” by Dropping Daylight.
People complain about the girl but forget that Brok was blue 🤷‍♂️
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ah” -song that play at the start of Thor Ragnarok
is there a blackies in nordic myth?
😍😍😍😍
Is it just me or did they change brok's voice? I hope not
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos : Ask your sons, half brother and stepmom about that.
When is this game coming out?
Aint no way boi. where do I gegt a ps5?
Can’t wait!!
"Let it serve you."  When he said "serve" he almost sounded British.
Keeping up the tradition of turning the redheads into token black girls I see.
Yep, I'm still rewatching this trailer 😂😂
It would be a nice touch to have Tyr and Mimir reminisce on old stories of them having fun with the Giants while on a boat or something like that.
Ever since this trailer dropped I can not stop watching this, the hype is real 🔥
Put this on the ps4! 😩 idgaf if the graphics a lil blurry
I just now noticed Freya completely ignored the boy and went straight for Kratos. It seems her grudge is hyper focused on the man rather than the boy who told Kratos to help her.
Vivement^^!
YESSIR
Is that Josh Brolin as Thor?
What is love ?  Baby don't hurt me
I'm so so very very hype for this game
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you." Kratos
gta 6 not even one announcement since 2013 but gow already announced why rockstar why
The game of all time is back
That girl at the end looks like that girl in the polar express
0:19 focus on the soundtrack This soundtrack used to play when kratos entered the room or something  But here it plays when LOKI came in
Release date?
Looking forward to some more Dad of Boy
2022
the ending is soo much cultural appropriation it's embarrassing.
Everyday I come here,watch this,imagine what's gonna be in store,and then go to sleep.
I will be coming back to this trailer every month until this game releases, my hype is unmeasured, not calm and not measurable
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person.."  *Spartan Rage Available*
End of trailer like: "Oh yeah by the way... Black Lives Matter Stop Asian Hate"
When does it come out?
Angrboda, the ngg ia goddess
Love that alot of people on here are ragging on Thor saying that he should've stayed away from Kratos, but in the mythos Thor only ever loses 2 fights. One against the goddess of old age, a fight no one can win, and the other is his fight with the world serpent, which he technically wins before dieing to the serpent's venom.
lança logo porra
if only i could buy a ps5 like over a year and these scalpers are selling for like 1300$ its ridiculous
اللهم صل وسلم وبارك على نبينا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم
go get me food boy *boy carrying a deer back* lol
Wow, it's the skin from Fortnite!!  😍 😍
Are u calm and resanable person?   Ask this to olympians, aesir
This dude is about 1050-1060 years old and he's still going strong, dudes a beast
Bro midgard is been change rn it makes the game even more interesting.. also mimir and new black smiths..
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a gener-"  "NO!"  We all know what happened the last time Kratos is a general...
I always was a huge fan of black people in Norse mythology.
Beyond hyped cannot wait LETS GOOOOO
"Are you calm and reasonable person?"  Mimir: alright, that's too far.
Who is that girl at the end?
Yo why does Tyr have 2 arms i thought he was supposed to have only 1
The only game that makes me want to get the Ps5
The soundtrack!!! 0:20
Why would they reveal Tyr in the trailer? Makes no sense
Who is tyr
The war is not end
ps10がいつ出るかを考えるだけで、画面に入ることができると思います
Now imagine when we kill Thor we kill him with the hammer and it’s start playing that kratos theme
Kratos is scorpion
So, we are 100% getting fenrir in the game. I mean, Tyr here still has his right hand fir crying out loud
Does he look smaller ?
I seriously can not wait
BOI!
Tyr: *right hand exists*  Fenrir: You know the rule, and so do I
so whitewashing is wrong, but doing the opposite when it comes to norse mythology is not huh?
Ima need the blade of Olympus in this one And ima need to be able to run the default armor as a cosmetics option for the whole game. And bring back the Spartans style shield cosmetic  from the last game too
Man I'm happy to see Mimir!
Just realised Mimir has jewls in his beard like thamus.  Mimir even said that thamus looks dashing for a corspe.
Meh.
"start thinking like a general" *kratos pulls out of his pocket GOW 1,2,3, Chains of olympus and ghost of sparta* "play these boy then you'll understand why i shouldn't think like a general"
Anybody else notice the loki horns when autreus walk into the cave with the deer
Yeah because black people existed in ancient Nordic tales. But you know.. D1v3rSiTy!!
I got a Ragnarok in my pants watching this trailer
Ohh, new add on. Dope
Tmnc, jogo foda do Caraí
I cant wait until Loki becomes evil
The best 😎🔥
Official Releasing Date?
Nice👌🏼
Va salir para ps4?
Wow
Thor: hi Kratos: I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye
Interesting note about Tyr: he has his right hand. The hand which is to be bitten off by Fenrir, the brother of Jormungandr and another son of Loki.  He also has a band of some sort on his right wrist. Now, it’s true that Fenrir may not be born yet, but if Jormungandr is around, then who knows? Perhaps we’ll get to see Tyr lose his hand in this game.  Honestly, with the way they’ve been portraying the Jotün in these games, we may even see Fenrir in a heroic light, since (due to Odin’s treachery) he’s destined to kill Odin come Ragnarok.
Imagine hating on a black character because you don't know history/mythology but accepting Loki being the son of Kratos
I like how they always have someone towering over Kratos like it makes a difference how big they are.
This game is going to be so awesome.
Do release in ps4 also
finally some representation for all of those black Norse people! what a f/cking joke
This game always gives me chills.
Fighting Freya will be amazing.,.
I'm betting there in the fight with thor kratos might so something with his hammer or when you probably kill him get his gauntlets and lift it , I know he probably won't be able to wield the hammer but it would be cool even if its a small interaction
Kratos sound like Earthshaker.  Nice
Yooooo
Someone tell Tyr to start clapping before it's too late
Kratos : war is not the only way. Kratos again : proceeds to butcher everyone in sight.
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person? You seem like a calm and reasonable person.”  *Flashbacks to Kratos pulverising Zeus’ face*  Kratos: “lol, yea”
O que aconteceu com a maldição da freha ela não pode nem se defender? Odin fez um trato com ela para ele tirar a maldição
Tyr is going to know who Kratos is. Curious to see how Atreus reacts to it all. Also, Svartalfheim looks awesome!
Am I the only one getting an "Athena vibe" off the girl at the very end?
Game of the year 2022 this you?
there was no black person in the old norse ragnarok
😳😳😳😯😯😯
Kratos gets to use Mjölnir!!
Come in.
Dev: Changes from greek to norse mythology Also dev: Blackwash norse giant Future dev:  Kratos is actually ga...
n?
Ps 4 pro pleasee
I can't wait to watch this entire game too as cutscenes on YouTube!
1:45 Kratos missed a chest lol
Maybe nidhogg will be in it
"Calm and responsible" Olympus: "You have made poor choice of words"
YASSSSSS
Best game forewer
Polar Express crossover? did not expect that
I know that there are some people who are upset with the girl not being white, but my guess is that she is half Egyptian. Since this will be the last of the Norse GoW games, it makes sense and would tie in the next game.
Super excited for this ... When is it coming anyway?
Kratos and Arthur Morgan calling each other boi
Kratos has his own version of Alexa
"Are you a calm and reasonable person" Kratos : 👀👀
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I came
I am from future this game is op I have played
I’m really interested to hear the full soundtrack
Just started replaying 2018. Forgot how young Loki is in the game, really makes me wonder what happens in the gap between the games
This is not thor ragnarok
The video game will b the finale of the "Norse Saga" that started with the 2018 title, but does anyone thinks that the developers of the "franchise" r thinking in transition it into other "mythologies (i.e. Roman Gods, Hindu Gods, Mexican Gods, etc.)"?
Wow
Got the token black in there
I wish xbox has such great exclusives
Thor:- “Are you a calm and a reasonable person” All of Greece:- “Trust me pal you’re not that guy”
Coming back to this and just realized Thor doesn’t have an accent like magni and modi lol
how about ps4?
My theory for the ending is that Thor or one of the Norse Gods will kill Kratos, fulfilling Faye's prophecy of Atreus holding Kratos's body, and transforming Atreus into Loki, therefore making the next 2 or 3 more games a vengeance trip for Loki, killing all the Norse Gods.
It great
Thor.” You seem like a calm and reasonable person”   Kratos.” Then you do not know me.”
👏👏👏👏
The music when it shows the title gives me chills everytime thats how you make a theme.
Most of all, Kratos is finally dressed for the weather!
Thor saying those words almost feels like an apology 😂
Nice job Xbox! 👏🏼
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Yes, so I'm going to reasonably and calmly tell the comment section to shut up with the "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" comments.
Boy Prepare Yourself Asgard awaits
If kratos destroys this mythology like where he comes from he and his son should go to Egyptian mythology
If we don’t get a Nordic version of The End Begins I’m going to scream
We are probably going to fight Thor in the beginning of the game might as well start with a bang
I actually want to see old kratos again, his rage and powers he had when he was  seeking vengeance on Zeus
I watch this trailer on a daily basis
add please
Last scn 😵
I've completed GOW 5 times. I look forward to completing Ragnarok 10 times 😁
Not for Ps4 😮😔
2:21 An Petsuchos in Midgard?
This is a certified hood classic
Are they aiming for a trilogy? Because it has the feel of the last series of having Thor as the main antagonist in this game and Odin in the next. You sprinkle in a cliffhanger concerning Loki and then have him play out his mythological role (from the perspective of a antagonist or hero).
Zzz
If this premieres the same time as loki season 2 atreus will be canon as a variant of loki👌😅😎
Is that loki
5
So was that "less blood" mode or something?
Thor - "are you a calm and reasonable person"? *shows mjolnir* Kratos - "yes" *turns back,and shows blades of chaos*
Which bosses are coming
Excellent!! This will be fun
It's perfect
awesome
Is it me or atreus looking more like Tom Hiddleston???
The only franchise I hope every generation gets to experience
this is the best version of Cratos.... old Cratos just suits him better
Thor: *comes to kill Kratos  The entire Parthenon: “dude, dude, don’t... seriously”
I'II CANT WAIT
This is amazing😮😮😮😮
Imagine if NoobMaster69 is Atreus
I'm dissapointed no one has focused on the idea that Kratos and Atreus are actually trying to stop Ragnarok now.  Doesnt that kind of put them on the Side of Odin and Asgard indirectly?
Ok, not only invade the universe, but also mythology too now
a black girl.... ffs America..
🥴🥵🤒🙀🤯🥳🥰👌🤟💯
"Mix of gameplay and in-game cinematics" Yeah as if we could still tell the difference
Cant wait for this game ,100% coming out for chrismas not 2022 i bet it be out at chrismas time
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general  L3 + R3
Seeing how tall Tyr is, it's no wonder why the Giants depicted him as one in the murals.
atreus hits puberty
PS4?
Man, Atreus' voice really does not fit. I hope he doesn't have much dialogue as I can see listening to his bratty little pre-pubescent cracking voice becoming really insufferable.   Surely they could have found someone better and not so American.
I’d love to see Kratos again with the sword of Olympus🗡️ against Thor
Just give me GOW on PC already!  Edit : FINALLY!!!!!!
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person?  *world serpent screams : RUN!*
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos : One way to find out (takes out blades)
It's here!!!
I bet tyr is just odin in disguise
Still not a fan of the camera angle, it doesn't really suit this style of gameplay 😕
Wow pls send it for PC this time
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  Shows 2009 GoW E3 Demo
Ебааааааать, это просто ахуенно!!!  Тот самый, Кратос вернулся!
God's of war
Rip xbox
2:50 who is this man
This whole business of "thinking like a general and not a father" led to lots of lonely Saturday nights for kratos
I like the way how kratos says NO
Anyone else notice that the girl at the end is shown in the subtitles as Angrboda? Loki's giantess wife who gives birth to Jörmungandr, Hel, and Fenrir!
Kratos seems scared of me. He should be.
Anybody hear Thanos' voice?
So all that stuff about a "Young Kratos" was just clickbait? Shocker.
Black girl in scandinavia? Are you serious? Go fys
Tyr looks like Ares tbh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Are you a calm and reasonable person” *Cuts to kratos killing everyone
So I thought Freya was cursed by Odin to never be able to harm another being, hence why she went into hiding...guess the curse is up?
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  "I HAVE BEEN FALLING FOR 30 MINUTES"
3:05 - Bet she hijacks the game.
Oooh c'est magnifique
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  "Th-that.. That sounded like sarcasm?!   WAS THAT SARCASM??! I HAAATTEEE SAAARCAAASSMMM!!!"
Sfde esqueceu o PS4
Tell me when you publish that game?!
anyone know the Viking music at the start?
Único ponto negativo é o thor  o cara parece um mendingo . O cara tem que pelo menos parecer  imponente mas com esse estilo  da mais pena que emoção de jogar
With each game Kratos becomes more fond of the art of dressing
Bruh stfu Atreus, he doesn't need to "stop thinking like a father"
*War.. war never changes*  ..oh wrong game.
I’m hoping this can also be played on the PS4 because I REALLY want to play this
My *BOI* has grown :')
This is gonna be Another Master Piece. Like if you agree.
DEVOU MACARTHUR plz relax  I SO got this and you😁😎😍😘😇
Now Thor may be strong but he’s not BLESSED WITH INVULNERABILITY TO ALL THREATS PHYSICAL OR MAGICAL
Dude....
Tyr isnt missing his hand that fenrir bit off 0/10
Thor's model should've been Jon Pall Sigmarsson...
please add hindi audio in this version it will be great👍
Is this coming for xbox too?
Where gonna fight thor ooooooff
2:51 6' vs 5'11
Game of the year. Calling it already
Irresistible
i hope we get new weapon
Calling it now, when we kill Thor, we take his hammer and finish the weapon element triangle(frost, fire, thunder)
Только попробуйте в конце этой игры убить Кратоса, я вам этого не прощу
Thor:You seem like a calm and reasonable person Also Thor:Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos:Ask My 🪓
Heimdal 2:12
Kratos saying no to Atreus/Loki has so much meaning after his years in greece
Welp this sets up my final decision. I’m getting the ps5
epic games: We make the best games Insomniac: no we make the game Meanwhile rockstar and santa monica: Excuze me
Deimos should return
0:21 que maravillosa referencia
Can’t wait to play this on the PS5😭
This finna be crazy 🔥🔥
....... :o
Who blew the horn??   Still a Mystery that's gonna be solved here!
nose que pensar... estoy feliz por el juego... pero en la mitología Nórdica en el Ragnarok según Loki muere... y se me va a romper el alma si se muere atreus
please give a release date or just a release window
THIS GAME IS GONA BE AWESOME!
Who is bigger, Tyr or Hercules?
i have a ps5.....                  not.
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Greek Pantheon: “Trust us, he is not.”
Name of the song at the beginning? Anyone?
tqm Kratos
Nord Mythology, Random black girl at the end
Even though it was prophesied, I hope Kratos lives.
Not a boy anymore, he a man.
Game of the year i already see
im not ready
Like para que llegue Playstation Now a latinoamerica 👍
My Ps5 literally sitting in a shelf waiting for this game to come out. Can’t wait !
up
Wo tier is as big as hercules
aRE yOu a cAlM aNd rEaSoNaBle pErSoN?
Just beautiful
3:11 I am here for this
Not buying with blackwashed BS
I can't wait to pre order it.
Why isn't this a movie?
Eat your vegetables kratos 1:57
Fantastic
Zendaya??
Odin shed a TYR when he saw this trailer
we need cratos wings
BGM of this game is on another level.
#2:50 🔥🔥
Aside from obviously race swapped Angrboda, I'm still going to play this game to see my man Kratos.
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person, Are you calm and reasonable person?", Said Thor. "Well.. are you?" Asked Kratos calmly.
Who want thor to beat kratos  Like me
Calliope?
i can’t wait for this!!!!
This game is going to blow the roof. Only reason for the ps5
I'm wondering if Faye knew how to stop ragnarok. Which is why she had Kratos and Atreus do that journey in the last game.
Brok reaction to teenage Atreus is wonderful.
Me encanta el juego pero me gustaría que este en ps4 para comprarlo
Is it possible for freya to get her fighting spirit back in exchange of reviving magni and modi back?
Is this gonna be on ps4?
1:35
Buenardo
I could do it for ps4 too or else give me the ps5 hahahahaahaha
:O :O =-O :-D :-D I can't wait to play GOW RAGNAROK!!
Is this only on ps5 or can u get it on ps4 too ?
Is it on ps4?
I want it, NOW!
Pls make 60 fps
Who is Tyr?
Tyr still has hands. We might see Fenrir in this game 🤔😀
c´mon santa monica let's release this masterpiece!!
Who are those people who have disliked this Legendary Teaser….. Ans - X-Box fans 😂😂
Kratos is a calm a reasonable person any person with a reasonable mind would have destroyed Olympus too.
Odin's presence through his Ravens Huginn and Muninn at 1:15
Just don't kill kratos pls.
Will this come for PS4 too???🤔
I like how Thor's voice almost sounded like Ultron 😅
Since this is the last game for the Norse series this game is gonna be huge. Hope we get to go to war with Odin!
Wonder if atreus is still gonna climb in my back when were climbing
Waaaaaaaaa
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Flackbacks: *ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS*  Kratos: yesn't...
Tyr is massive…
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  [rage of Sparta starts]  “That…is where you are wrong”
Where is thor
Atreus is a teenager now.
LEEETTTSSS GOOOOOO
Honest opinion, this trailer blows
Kratos's greatest power... RAGE!!!
Egypt next ? 🤔 Need to see Kratos body Anubis
mdu
Curious what Angrboda will be like in game and her relationship with Atreus/Loki
Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: ARES, DESTROY MI ENEMIES AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!!!!
This is going to be best looking game with Forbidden West, very tight but Spiderman PS5 versions already looking better than Cyberpunk but only if you are honest, only then you will see all flaws in Cyberpunk game which is looking like avarage game, wow effect is already gone because PS5 delivered so much in this Pandemic time so thank you SONY you are the best.
Why is zendaya in this trailer???
Another reason to buy Ps5
They better fix the Field of View on this game
🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:16 Hugin & Munin
2:07  “You seem like a calm and reasonable person”  “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”
looks like there is a lot of Centaurs in the game… but Centaurs are greek? Could they be traveling back to Kratos’s land?
I believe that Kratos is going to end fighting Chtulu
I dont know, I would have imagined a bit more for a reveal trailer. This feels like a DLC.
Yo no se  ingles pero mesirve solo ver
La pregunta es que mes del 2022 saldra??
Yeees finally
Can I play this in PC 😂😭
Releasing date ??
Looks and feels fine
My expectations here are higher than no way home
Is it gonna be for ps4 too or only ps5
Almost brought a Tyr to my eye.
^^
Douma Tyr còn sống, boy có ghệ bất ngờ đéy 😱
Is it reallllllllllllllllllllll! Yeah! It is comed yeah!
Deem this game will be crazy
Gente necesito un consejo quiero comprarme un play para poder jugar varios exclusivos como shadow of the colossus, gow, spiderman, tlou, detroit etc Cual play me conviene más comprar, y otra cosa todos los juegos antes mencionados los puedo jugar en play 5? Y mismo caso que salgan a dia de hoy los podría jugar en play 4 o ya?
Thor:Are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos: ask your brother that
1:35 fix it . Santa Monica
What's Triple H doing here ?
So it's not on ps4🥺
The light elf was freya’s brother. Freyar.
Me wishing I owned a ps 4 for gow4 and a ps5 for this
Puro ingles ay aqui bueno encontraste el comentario en español dime que opinas del trailer
1:55  Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a General!  Kratos: *Ghost of Sparta flasbacks*
When does it release cause that made my booty tingle
Vikangs
More fun games
Hope they make Atreus a playable character in this.
Youll get your answers soon enough 🙂 well some of them🤷‍♂️
Judging by how freya attack Kratos, Odin still didn't give Freya her wings despite of what happen...she need to transform into an eagle in order to aerial attack🤔🤔
Thor:are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos:that's a nice hammer you bought for me
Yo Atraeus can ride a deer now??
Thor are you clam and reasonable person?  Thanos left the chat
Ninja theory = cool
Ninja theory is cool
“Are you calm & reasonable person” Kratos: “Boi you’re in for a show”
nice but why a black character?
I thought Frey’s was cursed to fight… interesting…
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  if i could get a ps5 i would be...
This looks VERY similar to GOW 4 and i have no problem with that
Kratos has come a long way from being a Spartan General.
1:56 when you use a team fortress 2 sound for your trailer
Odin"dammit...this Kratos problem is become a huge problems for me....Thor...get in here"!!!!! Thor"you can't tell me what to do father" Odin"he is right..I can't...dam..oh why can't I remember if you want something done right...do it yourself"!!!!!!
LETS GGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Atreus voice sound like a 17 years old boy
Why is kratos so nerfed in gow 4 and gow ragnarok?
they shoulda gave loki longer hair. that hairstyle is atrocious
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"   "Idk, why dont you ask your boys?"
THOR = You seems like a clam and reasonable person  Kratos = And you seems like a pregnant fat guy
Black scandinavian woman... what.  Well bent under the feminists, Sony.
I literally cannot wait
In the prequel, Freya is hinted at searching for her Valkyrie wings. At best, she will be a huge adversary, like Sigrun in the Council of Valkyries.
I would,  very much, like to play this game when it is released to consumers. Please keep me informed of your progress toward completion. Thank you in advance. :)
Dad of boy DadOfRock
*excited to see the world serpent eat thor*
overratet af
I wish they made this one fimblwinter and the finale of the trilogy ragnorok i dint think one game is enought to cover what could be long ebough for two games maybe the third will have odin and kratos
Kratos = Leonidas Influenced By Ares
*boss is low and im low too* in moments of crisis, panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you
I know this game is supposed to be out in 2022, but I'm betting it wont be out till 2023. I think Sony knows this as well, but they don't want people to know yet so it wont affect console sales
*Sees tyr* Baldur: i thought you'd be bigger. Ah now i get it!
and the monkey got a role
Tyr will have to say goodbye to one hand
Kratos as a GPS when you pull up at the gym: "You are NOT ready."
Is this gonna be one shot as well? 👁️👄👁️
Stop the blackwashing and appropriation of my culture, thanks.
*Tyr stood up* Kratos- Hercules was bigger
I have a feeling that Kratos will smile  in Ragnarok...
Game is the better. But Even game cut scenes are the best than other movies !
Woooo
Sony if your reading this... Please don't make us actually kill freya because she's such an awesome character... And... She DID help save atreus..  Come on she's like the "lady Dimitrescu" of this series >< shes a fan favorite lol
My only complaint about this trailer is Kratos  doesn't say "BOY"
Of course. Gotta add a different race that never lived there at that time to satisfy the masses
One thing i didn't understand in the last game was, why does Kratos use the Blades of Chaos when in GOW 3 he is given the Blades of Exile and uses them all the way to the end?
Pick up that hammer and find out, tubby.
Thor : “ are you a calm responsible person” Kratos: bish if you don’t get out of here looking like you fnna do a high noon with that spoon for hammer , and while you’re at it go and get ya self some gym memberships “
Thor is going to get a thrashing..
Tyr scene remember me the Meeting between Kratos and Hércules, i was waiting for :  Tyr ( Hércules ): Hello, brother.
PS4 and ps5? Or just ps5?
i have a bad feeling that this isn't gonna be 1 cut like gow 4  cause some of the shot in the trailer is filming some weird place but i could be wrong though, even if this is not 1 cut i'd till be fine with it.
They had to put a black person didn't they
What if Thor hits athreus, then old gow music plays And kratos old attitude comes back😡 What a moment it would be🔥
Press F to pay respect for the People who don't have a Ps5 andjust came here to see the Gameplay (Includes me aswell :'/)
Tyr!?!?!
Timed release please ?
i cannot wait for that bad boy
People making fun of thor... Until they know comic thor hahahahha.. Kratos is no match for thor
I want to see mjolnir added to kratos' arsenal
Will Thor be the final boss or freya?
Урааааааа
Esta brigidoooo!!!! El juego algun dia lo voy a jugar csm jajajja pedazo de juego. Congratulations la media pelea final esta de pana
Atreus looks like those cringey youtuber kids that usually got millions of views just by uploading toys and playing in the playground
Freya Everywhere: Kratos - San
Any date?
See rockstar? THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT
Oh Im  sorry but I hate Atreus’s voice 🙁🙁
2:07 L3 + R3
IM HYPED ASF!!!!!!
Guys idk if people realised this but Freya doesn’t split the shield, her sword gets inveteen a crevice when it’s deploying which stops it (watch I’m 0.25) speed
I love you sony
Już nie mogę się doczekać tej części to będzie mega gierka
Thor: are You a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: ask L3 +R3
Me seeing kratos standing infront of tyr: oh, Tyr Is as tall as Kratos Me seeing Tyr get up: oh shi- anyway
🔥🔥🔥
Next time you should try the Egyptian gods as bosses it will be different
Play Station scalping and reselling never ends of PS5! all the true gamers cant get their hands on PS5
Bring it.
When is it gonna come out
Idk but this gives kingdom hearts vibes in terms of atreus getting older
is this available on ps4? 😢
I don't think Santa Monica knows what Norse mythology is? because Norse mythology only has Norses don't have blacks why talking about history not being rasist OKAY don't buy this game 🤮
How does this have dislikes.....like how?🤔
worst game
Genuine question. Why is there a black Asian girl in Norse mythology?
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"   *Rips a boulder from the earth with his bare hands and chucks it at Thor*
Keep in mind Kratos is 7 feet (2.13m) tall, so Tyr is not your average tall guy.
im guessing those human warrior are Einherjar
في علي بلايستيشن 4
I have a theory Atreus is not Kratos son
I’ve watched this preview like 7 times trying to piece as much together as possible
Thor : you seem like a calm and reasonable person ! Are you a calm and reasonable person ?  Kratos : have you heard about Greek mythology?  Thor : no !  Kratos : exactly !
Thor reaches his Mjolnir as soon as he sees Kratos with Stormbreaker.
Dislike are toxic Xbox fans
Glad the blades of chaos are back. The combat looks sick af
Looks like a PS4 Pro game, but not much more than that.
Is it gonna be on PS4 ?
Tyre encounter is like krtaos brother I forgot his name
Excited for Breath of the Wild sequel, it looks great already
I just want this game so I can feel the controller when i recall the axe
this is my third time watching this today lol
Coming to ps4 please🤗
Just spoiled like 60% of the game cheers lads lol
Low key (lol) Tyr can’t believe he’s seeing the ghost of Sparta right before his eyes. That alone gave him hope and confidence to get back to himself and rek shiet!
Sub-Saharan people in Scandinavian mythology? It's literally the same as putting Koreans in Egyptian mythology, or putting Latinos in chinese mythology
Thor:" you seem like a calm and reasonable person  Greek gods and modi and mangi :" yeah about that u will  be joining us
can someone gift me a PS5 pls
Why is Zendaya everywhere….
ATREUS: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General.
It on ps4?
me randomly watching this trailer for 17th time after release
RIP THOR
💣🙌🔥
Estáis de cachondeo vais puesto al miembro de los primos hermanos
GOW 2018: Protect & Teach Boy  GOW RAGNAROK: Boy Doesn’t Listen  GOW III: I Must Save Boy!
I want Kratos to fight the mythological Egyptian gods. Then the mythological Chinese gods then he teams up with the ghost of Tsushima to fight the mythological Japanese gods. And so on and so forth. All the pantheons.
Xbox players are crying kkkkkkkk
My theory is that that’s not Tyr but that’s actually Odin in disguise
That is not tyr his hanf is supposed to be gone
Legend is Back :)
How many times have you all replayed this? 🤣🤣
This is amazing!!!!
Getting huge doppelganger vibes everytime I see Kratos and Tyr face to face in this trailer 🤔
-"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" -Here, hold my beer for a second
I don't think thats Tyr. I think Odin is disguising himself as Tyr.
Oh my Kratos, incredible!
I just can’t wait for more of Mimir’s sassy backchat.
Same assets from the previous one, nothing new except enemies. but oh well, its GOF so automatic hype!
that little girl is so adorable🐰🐰🐰 x9000
"are you a calm and reasonable person"  I already feel bad for thor
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it, let it serve you!  Words to live by ❤️
will the game take place in Africa?
456k likes this is kratos Haters 💪🏻
dude I don’t even play games anymore due to work but I’m going to buy a ps5 just for this game
*WE*
I love the expression on Tyr’s face when he gets up. Its like “ughhh fineee lets get this over with…”
Que fashero
"stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  BELIEVE ME ,you don't want him to think like a general .
"stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!" in GOW 2018:needs to think like a father, but thinks like a general. in GOW Ragnarok:needs to think like a general, but thinks like a father.  man , kratos really needs to sort out his priorities.
Yeah turn into a bird  midway through an attack on kratos, that'll do it. Game is going to be fantastic.
هل من عرب هنا 🙂✌🏼
what ! I thought that GOW4 until I saw Attrius, I expected the graphic would better than that 🥺
Not a fan of the reinterpretation of the mythology, but I love the game so i will definitely give it a try.
Did they change his voice ? He’s not as deep and raspy as GOW
Make sho' ya'll bring it to the PS4 console now.
If we cant pet the sled dogs, I ain't buying the game.
This game was going to rock  Waiting for this game 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh mah gerd, itz the guy from Fortkite.
@playstation, this is a really racist move to make a mother of three doom monsters of scandinavic mythology being black.
6,6 mil caxistas deram deslikes kkkk
The reason I needed to buy a ps5
Angrboda 💩👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I have watched this a zillion times and will watch a zillion more
There is a colored person is GoW, why
this looks like another masterpiece
Can kratos use blade of olympus again?
Ooohhh Playstation, mais de uma semana já e nada do trailer dublado?? Vou ter que ir no Japão fazer protesto?? AGILIZA
Nice to see we will be riding a dog sled with the 2 wolves that start ragnarok
Haven’t played a GOW game, but happy for people who were waiting for this
Babysitter edition 2
Same gameplay, lvl 1 leviathan and chaos blade ? Naaah dude
It’s the guy from fornite
Tyr: Does my high intimidate you?  Kratos: Have you ever heard about Gaia?
I like how in the trailer we see the dark and light elf's fighting and Kratos on the dark elf side
When can I pre-order?
OH ME VENGO 😱😎🤙🏻
“In moments of crisis panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you”
Its me or anyone else ? that the voice actor of Loki is Tom holland
10th time watching this
Notice as Atreyus walks in with the Stag on his shoulders, it looks like hed wearing a crown. Nice detail 🤯
2:08 👇 THOR: ARE YOU CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON? KRATOS: I WILL TELL YOU HOW AND WHY 🤣😂
Something tells me that what we saw in the trailer is like 10% of the actual game lol
These developers really gave Thor sausage fingers. It’s nice to see a fat character model after all these years.
atreus: stop thinking like a father. think like a general! kratos:no! the only time i did it, i destroyed a country and all of their gods. i wont make the same mistake again thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? kratos: L3+R3
Who is the girl in the end ?
Zero tolerance to this sh t
Man this should be a movie.
In the future sony exclusives will be on xbox too!
That "NO" just reinforces the badassery of Kratos 😂
Looks awesome. Not sure about the shoehorned token black character in Norse mythology though. Might even pre-order this!
I've watched the trailer maybe 100,000 times already
will it on ps4?
making arrows for atreus
2:07 Ragnarök is more than likely gonna start with this Thor boss mega fight 🔥 after 4 years we can finally see how the ending of GOW 2018 will play out into the next game.
will it be in ps4??
I really hope this game comes out soon!
I, i, i, i just... Can't wait...
90% : Are you a calm and reasonable person? 10% : other
I hope it reads my PS4 so it knows the runic attacks from the last game
Ninja theory = cool
Ninja theory is cool
Xbox RIP
Oh I want Fenrir to be in the game. Imagine Kratos unleashing Fenrir to fight Odin
WOW WOW WOW!!! IT'S COMING
looks fricking awesome!
Time to stock up on tissues to weep man tears when this comes out
Weed.
My excitement is immeasurable and my day is fixed.
I hope this game release next month because i can get this next month and battle field 2042
Cleitus「boy !!」 ↓ Cleitus「??? !!」 I have to expect it !!
Ps 4? Or ps 5
Imagine Kratos voice to be your GPS Map: "Turn left, boi"
Of course they had to put a POC in the game. *eyeroll*
If the little black girl betrays me in the game I’m gonna cry
I can’t wait to kill Freya lol
Hope I can actually get my hands on a ps5 before this comes out.
I am excited
The ravens of odin at 1:16
It’s awesome the guy who voices thor actually looks like he could be thor
Hope this game is for ps4 too :)
Him walking up with the antlers as horns is clear foreshadowing for being Loki soon !
I watch this 10 times per day
You can hear Fenrir growl and step at 2:57 this going to be fire 🔥
Now that's what i call next gen graphics!
I really hope this game doesn't end on Atreus chained to a rock with the snake venom drip torture happening.  That would break me.
This is where I think Thor's a bit of an idiot he has no knowledge of what Kratos has done to his own Gods like do your history search dude
I watch this like 3 times a day, it's getting unhealthy
"Are you calm and reasonable person ?"   Cow picture : Perhaps
Bruh fat thor is gonna be flipping slick
I need to know when this comes I’ve been waiting for this game to come out
3:05 black woman wft Matt Sophos are you idiot
This gonna be on PS4 right?
mimir are with the two eyes
Will we finally get to know who blew the serpent horn
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person."  "And you seem like a master of comedy."
А где афроамериканская богиня про которую так много говорят???🤨🤨🤨
Can you play this on ps4
Ayo Freya being an enemy now is going to hurt…
The only thing I don’t like about this is atrues
Cant wait to play, i am so happy Ben Prendergast is in the game
Ohh myan!!! Epic, Favourite game of mine. Waiting for watching full gameplay walkthrough!!!
So it's going to be Anti White, communist propaganda
Ghost of Sparta is back.
Right now I've seen so many people ask "Why does Thor look so different   from the MCU version?" It's getting quite sad...
Can't believe I almost forgot watching this today.
get over here
I'm curious as to who's gonna do the motion capture for Kratos, since Shad Gaspard has since unfortunately passed away 😞
is it only for ps5?
Ачо в Скандинавии тоже чёрные были?
Something about Kratos saying: “we do not know what mother wanted.” Is just… beautiful. 1:03
Wp
Please delay this as much as you need to
nice 0:21
Kratos literally is the mike tyson of the game world
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you."   - Kratos
l was thinking of buying the Xbox series x but now  that l saw this Game l Will definitely Buy the ps5
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos: “Tell me, have you ever heard of Greece?”  Thor: “No...?”  Kratos: “Funny, cause I expect to hear the same from the next person I ask about Asgard...”
His head is as big as kratos' torso
i bet the part at the end where she says you'll get your answers soon enough will not be in the game. she will be a character in the game but not that scene, this scene was only made for this trailer
Still cant understand why ppl are mad about thor, he looks exactly as i would expect after all he has ate.
I will be looking forward to playing it 😍
Dint Fimbulwinter started in previous game? And technically it should last 3 years then Ragnarok begins. PUberty hit Atreus in those 3 ish years.
I miss those live crowd reactions.
Can we play this on PS4?
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person?" - Thor Zeus - "Am I a joke to you?"
My money is ready to pay for this
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person ?!  Kratos: ask Greece   Meanwhile Greece: 💀💀💀
Ps4?
Here for my daily watch :D
ojala saliera en pc espero no tener que comprar un ps5 para jugarlo bien, literal si me compro un play es solo para jugar estos titulos
2:34 magic horse with loki
I am waiting
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  Gaia "let the rage of the gods flow through your blades kratos"
Cant wait to play
It's just the same game
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general."  "Sure!" Atreus has left the chat
Is it only on ps5  or PS4
Hope its better than the last one.
So....still no platforming.... sigh
Thor: "you are a calm and reasonable person" Spartan Rage: "Is it my time yet? Is it my time yet? Is it my time yet?"
*BOY!*
I hope they have fenrir
War, War never changes
Will this only be on the ps5
I was eating food and watching this and I heard atreuas voice MY SON IS BIG- I MEAN KRATOS SON AND I STARED CHOKING WHILE EATING
I'm sooo hyped for this but they shouldn't have revealed Tyr in the trailer. Would've been amazing if we found out in-game.
Wow, just amazing
Freya still got beef😂
Finall got a PS5 to play this
This looks better than my future...which I guess isn't much
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Gods of Olympus in the afterlife: Ey! Check it out, he gonna do it again.
what's next ? Kratos killing Ancient Egyptian gods ?
Im watching the part from 2:13 to 2:43 on a loop just cause it looks so cool and fun
After i know kratos voice actor is a awesome jaffar warrio i cannot see him without saying teal c
Didn't Mimir said Freya was cursed so she cannot fight and harm anyone?
I think Atreus hited puberty his voice is kinda changed
I have a Theory  at 2:00, I have a feeling that Thor is saying that Atreus seems like a calm and reasonable person and asks Kratos if he is a calm and reasonable person
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *We've been trying to reach you concerning your vehicle's extended warranty*
Can't wait looks awesome
WHY DIDNT I GET THE NOTIFICATIONS
Claiton
1m times i watched the trailer how else do the same 😂
Y siguen reciclando contenidos ha
I wonder how much time it would take to Kratos from GOW 3 (fully equipped) to beat all asgardian gods
Santamonica we love you so much
i love this trailer its amazing, but there is one time kratos says boi and you can barley hear it, not acceptable.
I have no idea why, but I love the way Christopher Judge says *Asgard.*
It seems you can't play as Atreus... :(
1:16 low key thinking that is odin's two ravens.
Notice how atreus shadow looks like loki.
is this coming to ps4?
Thor talk to Kratos  Thor : Are you calm and Reasonable person?  *Saul Goodman from a nail saloon Saul : Oh pls Ladies cover your ears
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: kid just check this comment section of my beloved and awesome fans
It's not boi anymore it's Teenager
Boy:  father, tell me about your past. Kratos: ever heared of Greece ? Boy: no Kratos: exactly.
Why is Thor fat in this one like in Endgame?
I don't think this game will be the end of all God's I think it's just the begging and there will be a part 2.
Release date?
1:34 no video game in the world can escape this glitch (apparently even trailers) 🤣🤣🤣  Hint: focus on the axe and blades
Better than gta 5 expanded and enhanced
1:15 that could be Odin's ravens messenger Huginn and Muninn
Hype
Who came here only to see Thor?😂😂
i just notice Heimdall was never mention before or in this (so far) considering his role in ragnarok
Can't wait to play the cracked version
Can't wait to see the game play someone will post on youtube
ples like my
owwwwww 7M view😍😍😍 L3 R3  RAGE FOR THOR 😂
Trailer  full of goosebumps  😬
I buy my PS5 i can't wait to play this. Whos waiting to play this? 👇
"War, is not the only way."
NORSE mythology and they add a little black girl.  Just great   Gfys if you don’t agree
I wonder if we'll kill Freya in this game
I thought years would've passed. I expected Artreus to be a young adult by now.
Is this game can be play at ps4?
Will this be on PS4?
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Zeus and Ares: “🤣”
Psyched that Bear McCreary is coming back to score this :D
Is it just me or did Thanos became Thor?
Can't wait to play this DLC.
0:21 Love how they used the deer carcass to foreshadow atreus' transformation into Loki
Boi already hunted deer.
*Tyr shows how he is double the size of Kratos* "My grandfather was the size of a literal mountain. This is not as intimidating as you think it is"
I hate exclusives  Brand shouldn’t dictate what you can and can’t play  \/ salty PlayStation fanboys
THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
Alright.   1) Freya is freed. 2) Skoll and Hothi might be the wolves with that toboggan  3) TYRRRR?! 4) and this game is going to be the game of the century.  That’s all.
Also looks like a lot of recycled assets
Is it for PS5 only? Cause I don't plan on buying next gen and this game should be for PS4
Am i the only one that knows Atraes can control mother nature? Lightning thunder hurricanes tornados And other stuff
LOOK AT HOW GROWN OUR BABY *Boi* IS
press O to launch the game
I don’t think a single person survived trying to square up with kratosz
I am really glad they kept mimir
Why is there a black girl here? I just expect they do a game about Aztec mythology or something similar, and the last thing I would want is a blonde ,green eyes girl, because even though there might be unrealistic creatures, it makes no sense having someone with a certain phenotype that would've never even existed in the imagination of the culture that imagines that mythology.
Thor doesn't realize that he brought Kratos a new weapon... 🙄
Just noticed that Jörmungandr wasn’t in the trailer at all. I was kind of hoping to see big snake boi since he’s cool as hel
All I know is we BETTER be able to go to Asgard this time!!!
Amazing!!
I cannot wait for this game to be as terrible as the last one but still get great reviews because it looks and sounds pretty
Perfeito
Is possible that Angrboda is Loki’s mom & Kratos BabyMom ?
Really cool to see the Elk summon back with Atreus riding it into enemies
q bosta...krato veio denovo..lento fraco e cuzao
I'd rather play GOW1 remastered remake over and over than this
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person” The olympians from Tartarus: *laughs hysterically*
I cannot wait for this game to come out but at the same time I got excited when they delayed it
2:51 Like size is matter in this universe🤷🏽‍♂️
Kratos vs Thor who will win?
Un poco más de gráficos y ya hasta respiran
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: yeah let me just get my Blades of Harmony and use my Spartan calm.
"War is not the only way"  What a character development
THIS LOOKS WILD!!! 🤘
Finally we get to find out who blew the horn! I still believe it is atreus from this game
nu
As much as I love Kratos, I so wish I could play as Thor too
It looks so cool 😎
Anyone think it would be awesome if in the next game, Kratos crosses over to North America and fights Native American gods?
1:42 i think that's the octopus who prediction fifa word cup 2010 and now he is going to predicition who win the ragnarok
Even though i can't play it  I'm still excited 😆
An epic adventure is coming brothers
Misleading title it's on PS4 as well sony are scammers
Gow to Gow are always connected. F*cking beautiful cant wait!
"stop thinking like a father think like a journal. " Trust me kid you don't want to see that
What if we get Thors hammer and we can cover a little bit🤩🤩🤩🤩
The boy has grown 🤧 I can't wait to see what surprises he has now
"Keep your expectations low and you'll never be disappointed" - Kratos
Looks like the exact same game tbh
looks like freya broke whatever spell Odin had on her, because she fighting now.
Only for ps5? 😞
Easily my most anticipated game
theory:  you see freya attack kratos maybe she comes for revenge after killing her son (baldur)
What in jarnsmida happened to em!
Aguardo MT por mais que n vo jogar mais quero ver umas lives
Idonno how many times I've seen this trailer but I just keep coming back to it
I came here for the fat thor meme xD
Feel bad for Mimir, was hoping he could gain some form of mobility. Like a magic floating stand or some Dwarven contraption he can control with his mouth.
been a fan since day one till this day🥶🥶
"Stop thinking like a Spartan rage and start thinking like calm and reasonable person"
Tyr reveals his hieght kratos is like huh wanna fught me bro
0:22  ... I have goosebumps.....
in love with this series since 12 years old
Finally some one will teach thor some lesson about being humble and get him descplined.
Greatest game ever
Will it be available for PS4?
I am now a calm and reasonable person.
Please make it for pc
The best game 🎮
Please tell me who is the tall person
Oh no, human settlements. You know what happens to those Kratos visits
Nope. Blacks.
Thor : are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Boy you better tell him what happened to Baldur!!! 🤣🤣
i could be wrong but it kinda looked like kratos was making arrows at the beginning. why do i get the feeling he & atreus just had an argument & they’re both trying to make it up to each other without words lol :’) and i also have to wonder what freya did to break that curse that keeps her from directly attacking other people!!!  i’m trying to keep my expectations low so i’ll never be disappointed, as per kratos’s own advice, but i can’t help smiling every time i watch this trailer. super looking forward to this!!!
When you have ps4: ;-;
I wonder why there is a black Viking? You made this game Goldberg?
RAGNAROK
ANYONE LIKES IT SAY RAGNARÖK
Afaik, surtur is probably the one to destroy the asgard in ragnarok and that's why I kept looking for him in the trailer
Finnaly kratos use him old blade im always waiting for this
nice
Can't Wait To Play This Game !!!
Intro:Kratos Music:he’sssss stilllll hereeee kratosssss winssssss Thor:💀
Tyr like john wick
When are we gonna get the game where we play as BOY
Game of the year is coming ❤️
We love this Boy !!!
"Not today, maybe not tomorrow but I will play it and enjoy it."    - me broke as f and with potato laptop 😭😭😭
Will this be on pc
Thor   " Are you a calm and a reasonable person ?"  Kratos  right d pad R1 left d pad triangle left d pad again    :3
Ninja theory = cool
Ninja theory is cool
Can't w8
So atreus found his love
I watch this once everyday.  Every time Tyr stands up, I get +78 Adrenaline points
"Calm and reasonable person"?? Person is a modern word created by government  related to personal numbers and certificates of birth. Not a person; he is a calm and reasonable man! Shameful.
F porque no sale en ps4
Mimir is an absolute treasure.
HYPE BUT IM FROM XBOX, F
Didn’t Tyr get his hand bitten off by Fenrir the great wolf and one of the main players in ragnorok
I'm so confused what should i buy, ps5 or gaming laptop?
Atreus/loki is the serpant
New updates:  + Graphics + Details  + Atreus grew + Kratos got new skills + Freya becomes an enemy + we found a new enemy/friend
Who is that girl at the end? She seems very important.
This Game would come in ps4??
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  Yes, until my son starts questioning.
I was expecting adult Atreus but I’m thankful he’s still young
is it gonna be available on ps4?
Why so many dislikes? It looks great!
wow goosebumps great cinematic man they always deliver a great game
А ШО ТО ЗА УЗБЕЧКА В КОНЦЕ ГА?
Game of the Year Award 2022 goes to ...
He sounds older but doesn't really look older
Top 👏🏾👏🏾🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
YESSSSSS
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Couple years earlier: “ZEUS! YOUR SON HAS RETURNED! I BRING THE DESTRUCTION OF OLYMPUS!”
Its playable in ps4? >:()
Another victim of equality
Will this be out on ps4 as well or only ps5
Thor:Are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos: Wait a second lemme use my Axe of peace, blades of harmony and spartan calmness
Atreus After Seeimg AngrBoda: :"BOI"
Waiting youtubers streaming it
So far the graphics look amazing
Can anyone tell me who tyr is before this game
Please don't let this be the next Cyberpunk
SoundTrack
this game is so cool
L3+R3
Please take your time
No comprare ps5 se aplazaron
Atreus is simply a drag on Kratos and the saga.
Am I the only one coming back to this trailer everyday?
Duuuuuuudddddeeeee Brrrooooooooo Maaannnnnnnnnn… I can’t wait😄😃
I swear if this doesn’t come on PS4 I’m going to hack ea servers again
BOY am I excited for this game!
I can already see mk playing it
BRO I CANT WAIT
Now Atreus is going to be an angsty teen.
Tyr stood up like he had beef
He still needs to kill Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, Dionysus and more from the Greeks
1:55 Nooo
Has no one noticed the monsters at 2:00 wearing Greek soldier helmets
2:54 Tyr is jus like 'wassup lil brotha' xD
Tyr looks super menacing... I can't to fight him!
💩
I like how Mimir gets his own little space. He has a table and little bookstand. I just thought that was wholesome  Edit: I just realized that they actually braided his beard and it has jewelry in it. Which is even better
Esto estará candelaaaa
Lets see if he still calls him boy if he doesnt im going to be mad
DAD SIMULATOR IS BACK
It has not been released yet and is already nominated for the best game of the year
Me: gow4 is the best game ever nothing can surpass it Santa Monica: hold my beer
THOR: "You seem like a *calm* and reasonable person. Are you a *calm* and reasonable person?" We Greeks do not do *CALM* , we just carry on...
;)
I don't have ps5
😍
The boy has grown
So excited for this one!!
شوكت تتوفر في الاسواق
I don't know how mimir got out of that one alive 2:22
You challenge me mortal
Ojalá no decepcione:)
Hope Santa Monica don't kill Kratos in this part
I wanted to see gameplay so badly and now I wish they didn't...I literally can't stop wanting to play this game already
At 1:54 what is kratos holding? And I wonder if we will see faye in a flashback maybe?! ANDDDD WILL WE SEE ATHENA AGAIN?! WILL THEY REFERENCE ZEUS!? SO MANY QUESTIONS
2:49 When Kratos meets his Norse Counterpart
Finalmenteeeeee😃🎉
“You’ll get your answers soon enough, we’ll some of them.”  …Yeh i’m sure we will -_-
2 gods of war side by side against odin
Is it me or has Kratos beard become less greyer  from the 2018 version...Has he dyed it????
The best
Am I the only person who don't have ps just came here to see go5 graphic ,and action stuff
Geniaaalll Grütze aus Polen.
Tyr for the NBA please!!
plizz back swiming
Anybody notice the world serpent missing?
A movie is needed on Kratos
2:12
Shut up and take my money
can i play this game ps4 pro ???
People got to stop with the “Boi” now. As per the ending of the last game, he is now “Son”…  Although he will always be BOI in our hearts.
Wow tyr is a little... Tall
Saldrá para PS4?
Sony can STUFF all their BS! This generation is going to be owned by Microsoft!
Atreus' voice has gotten deeper 🤩
Quick time events? 🥺
POV : Tyr is actually Orkos
*takes deep breath* Boi.
Well it seemed like a teaser more than a trailer😅😀
Зачем нужен иксбокс если на нём нельза поиграть год оф вар .
No way he doesn’t get mjolnir, right?
Love the easter egg/tease of Loki's future helmet while carrying the deer
TAKE MY MONEY NOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Tyr stands* Everyone: “You’re gunna regret that!” Poor Tyr can’t even stretch his legs
3:05 yeah african gods would be next to be slain.
I wonder if kratos will get new weapons for this game 🤔
Yo man, atreus sound, he is a teen now
Stamped 💪🏾💯
QUE HYPE MAN ! 🥵
the psplayers are ready for it boooooy
I can't wait to play
Boy
More jörmungandr please game 😌
If they don't send it then I'll press L3 + R3 >:c
Kratos is going to wield Mjölnir. Calling it rn.
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: "Wouldn't you like to know, weather boy?"
I don't agree with the complaints about this and Forbidden West being cross generational. I understand them, I just don't agree it's that big of a deal. That's usually the case at this early point in a transition between generations. Sure, naturally the weaker console hardware is going to hold back how far they can push things on the stronger console because the ceiling must move with the floor. But I think the fact these are exclusives means they're going to have more headroom to work with PS5 enhancements before launch and over time with patches because they aren't developing for a wider range of parity. The sky is the limit once the inevitable PS5 Pro releases or they eventually port to PC. Whenever that is. Considering how amazing both franchises still look and play for engines originating last gen, it's understandable the leap isn't going to be as huge graphically or mechanically as an IP designed from the ground up for current gen hardware. Plus, how are they going to make the same kind of return on investment through sales if it's exclusively PS5? Sony reports over 10 million units have been sold since launch making it the fastest selling console of all time but I question how many of those sales went to actual households and how many are still with scalpers. Even if most scalpers have liquidated at least 50% or more of their horded stock to desperate buyers by now, the fact is there are still an estimated 80-100 million more PS4 owners in the world and counting. That's 80-100 million or more copies of GOW Ragnarok and HFW they could be selling vs. if those were strictly PS5 releases.
Estaría épico que kratos pierda un brazo aunque no podría usar las espadas pero si el hacha
So…is this the part where Atreus finally goes L3+R3 properly?
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person Greek patheons:believe friend he ain't
And soo the prophecy begins... I see that Atreus is still a nagging older boy😂 Can’t wait looking outstanding!!
Can't freaking wait!!! SO EXCITED!
I really hope we get to fight Fenris at some point.
Why did the girl from polar express show up at the end?
Cleitão🔥
Hercules was more bigger and muscular... Kratos:ain't scared of nobody
Can't wait to smash Thor's head in with his own hammer lol
Kick me in the nuts if the girl at end isn't Angrboda
Fat thor design is within logical reasoning.
OH BOI
“I should be out there looking for Loki” proceeds to carry a deer with the horns on either side of his head indicting he’s probably Loki
3:04 cultural appropriation at its finest
Now, we waited
Let’s hope you can transfer your stuff from the ps4 game to a new savefile in this game
Is that Skoll and Hati pulling their sleigh? I can’t be the only one thinking this considering they’re both black and white coats, can’t wait to see what Fenrir is going to be.
Watched this trailer so many times
GOW Ragnarok. With the participation of Avengers Fat Thor and the inclusive character in a mytholigy where all are redhair or blond habitants.
*boy*
Diversity girl at the end. So pathetic.
Im a average gamer but I see no difference with the one on ps4
I cant find anyone talking about it but i think those horns in the beginning are really important and will have meaning later in the game.
politicized denigration of European history is bad practice, why don't you do anything in reverse, with the white African gods ??? I am not a racist, I am against insanity !!!!
Wow amazing
I’ve watched this like six times now.
Please has more enemies, weapons and bosses this time
I think I'm already addicted to Ragnarock I have been watching this video since it came out
Start thinking like a general. Kratos: I did and I stopped
0:57  Take the reins boy, there is a bug on the windshield lol
"you will get your answers well some of them" it means another game will come bois
Loki varient identified
Man kratos has the one of the best character development I ever see to killing and picking up fight with anybody-> "To war is not the only way, killing somebody has consequences" 👏👏👏👏👏👏
3:05 BLM (<0_0<)
Kratos is just like the quite kid in a class, just don't make him angry or he will *L3 + R3*
I don’t know if my heart can handle the fight with Freya.
No one going to talk about the African girl in the Norse Mythology game? I’m fairly certain the Norsemen never conquered Africa. If there is an African heroine in Norse Mythology could someone please explain?
This is Spartaaaa!!!!! Yeeew
Never would've thought kratos would be regarded as a "calm and reasonable" man
This is gonna be a top Tyr game
Official?
Finally 🔥🔥🥶🥶
3>
Well now Tyr, what a nice set of hands you have....
🥵
Literally looks like a ps4 game but just slightly better smh
Thor:"Are a calm and reasonable person?"     Greek Gods: Are you Kratos?
When Chester went to Isekai: The boy sure looks like Chester to me.
0:48 "Who loki is?", I thought you was loki  bruh 😅
Hope kratos got a valkiria wings an use to fly. like old games
Im literally tweakin for this!
Can’t wait to watch jack play this 😱
I wish they didn’t show tyr
nice cultural apropriation
You see Freya attack you in this trailer which means that Odin has free’d her from her curse as Mimir states she is unable to attack anyone, not even in self defence! So it should be interesting to see how much of an involvement Odin has in this game!
thor: you seem calm and reasonable person.  me: famous last words.
2:11
So if I can’t get my hands on a PS5 without paying over price for it I can still get this new game on PS4
If they all ready played it on ps5 then just release it 😜
such nice graphics 😍
I'm interested to see how this Freya thing works out... If I remember correctly... She had a curse on her that prevented her from bringing harm to people physically or by means of magic.
Don’t mind me just here for my 200th time
My dad play on Playstation and is it coming to the ps4?
why this looks like 30 fps?
ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT THAT WAS “THOR FOR A MIN”
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Is that skyrim remake?
How people disliked this? Not even Phil
22:00 .. 30:00 SONG??? 😢😢😥😢
Is this the final game ?!
A Paz de Cristo a todos em especial a  Você  que leu  esse comentário .🙏🏼.
I thought Freya was cursed to not being able to fight anyone by Odin 🤔
OP bhai
YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cannot wait for fenrir vs jormungandr... cannot wait
Available for PS4????????
i just realized GOW has one of the best face expressions, other games just look Bot-ish
Nd que dree fire esto es juego
“Coming soon to ps5!” Yet nobody has a ps5
@0:21 foreshadowing of Artreus’s Loki helmet?
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  Hold R2
yes.
Amazing
1:57 that no was powerful
Is this coming out on ps4
The graphics definitely got improved, also is it just me or does Kratos’ skin look paler this time around? In GoW 4 I thought the ash on his skin wasn’t quite the correct “Ghost of Sparta” tone. Upgraded graphics always have unexpected benefits.
Game of the year 2021
Mano olha oq esse jogo se tornou,quando eu jogava no PS2 nunca imaginaria q ele ficaria tão foda
Imagine we get mjolnir as a weapon after beating Thor
I have not even beat GOW 4 yet. Now another master piece? Lol! 😅
He has strombreaker now 🔥🔥🔥
The main mythical figures I want to see Kratos fight at some point are Cthulhu and Sun Wu Kong. Either of those fights would be epic.
acabe
I'm so excited but it would be cool if odin made some kind of appearance im only curious on what he would look like
As a 36 year old father of 2 boys. This brings me joy
Bueno creo que era algo obvio que la bruja hiba a volver XD
I like how I can tell which comment are being removed by what I'm not seeing.
THATS AWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME
Looks exactly like the PS4 game. Also no money shot. This one is cross gen right?
Porra playstation cade o uncharted 5 crlh kkkkk revive ai porra
I have a feeling that Loki will be the villain in the next game based on the way he's going with his thirst for bloodshed.
Arteus and the girl at the end look like miracle boy and girl from polar express movie
Is it only ps5...?
العشق   شريت ps4 عشانه   والان بشتري ps5 عشانه  😍😍😍😍
The boy is becoming a Man
This looks sick! I can’t wait
I'm not racist but why is there a black girl in norse mythology?i mean....north and south! Does that make any sense?
I think fenrir is a bit hungry
Dont tell me people are calling the sled pulling wolves, skoll and hati. Come on guys they hold a special place in norse. The chasers of sun and moon they can't be just normal sled pulling wolves, even the official twitter handle wrote their names as svenna and skeppi i dont know the exact spelling i guess..
otiaaaaa comienza el racnarok
I'm getting a feeling that thor didn't ask kratos about calm and reasonable person thing. Maybe he asked someone else and editors made that way for the trailer only for the excitement.. imo
I can't wait to see odin, fenrir and kratos crossing the bridge of the damned and really wanna see what is actually in there that mimir strictly said not to go there..
"are you a calm and reasonable person?" me spamming o in gow 3
If you ever think you're a loser, remember that 6.000+ people gave a dislike in this trailer
🌚🌚😐I think photography is old, but dialogue is new. I look forward to something more powerful.
Aw man, Atreus isn't a B O Y anymore.
black lives matter...
Freya can “turn into an animal”
Just few days ago i saw the patriot act episode of Gaming industry and found out how workers are squeezed dry. Looking at it's graphic and imagining how much hard work they must have put in it, I can't help but feel bad for these workers.
Isn’t Freya not supposed to be able to hurt any living thing but she attacks kratos
Daaaaaaaaang!!
"stop thinking like a father and think like a general"   ouch.......   hit a nerve
🔥🔥can't wait
I just have my thoughts that this will be the second of three part series . Maybe there is a cliffhanger in this video
Freaking cool!! Hahaha Sta. Mónica left fans name for the new game.... 😁
is it a DLC?
veo meme con el ¡NO! de Kratos jaja
Now I want a ps5
Nobody peeped in the beginning atreus was looking like loki holding that deer?
I hope we get to see Krato’s classic goatee in the game. Maybe if he fights Thor or something?🤔
Me literally only gonna buy a ps5 for this
Yes I would like to own a PS again just to play this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That dwarven realm looks soo dope
Is this going to pc?
man, tyr is so frikkin tall
The point is: Nobody can defeat Thor!
The best part is the beginning. "This game may have content unsuitable for children". Not this game is definitely not for children. Just may have.
Really cant frikkking wait for this.
MNAAAA AMIGO BUENISIMO 10/10 SAQUEN ESTA MIERDA RAPIDO
Mimir is such a likeable…..head
I'm so excited!!!
Snap!
este es el comentario en español que buscabas- me gusto el trailer y el juego
فيه حلب بالموضوع اخر شيء لكن يجي 🤩🔥
I'm pretty sure those crows are Huginn Muninn His  Messageners in norse mythology
За темнокожую скандинавскую великаншу никогда не куплю эту игру.
What if Kratos will turn into a wolf?
Freya: “You took everything away from me.” Kratos: *”I don’t even know who you are.”*
Can’t wait to play
As long as I see Keaton use mjolnir to bash the fat dobbers face in I’ll be happy
when will it be released?
He is no longer B O I, now he is T E E N
The best game series ever existed No game will ever be this perfect with the lore and the gameplay and every other little thing. These devs are not from this world. Since the Journey started in greece i was addicted to every single game.
I think the fact they showed us Tyr in the trailer just tells me theirs so much in store for this game ! 🤩
2:50 Kratos like: Huh, I thought you'd be bigger, but you definitely the one.
Do you see the sence that Kratos meet Tyr look like Tyler1 looking up Mel Capperino-Garcia?
When you think you're tall....
Oh I'm certainly coming
2:35 TF IS THAT??! 🔥🤣
Pretty meh. Same combat, same Atreus cluelessness.
am i the only one who prefer the og gow especialy the third one over gow 2018?
Wow he knows how to hunt now. How fast they grow 😤🤣
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing. Harness it. Let it serve you."
No creo que ese sea el Tyr real
Is this a ps5 exclusive only? Or can we play it in ps4 as well?
Insert "Norse black girl" because meh diversity 🙄
Great parallel between someone who has never experienced war, being Atreus, seeing only the glory told of in stories and sagas, versus Kratos, someone who has lived it, and knows those stories are liars
Boi went in the direction of deer
Congratulations! your boy has evolved into big boy
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Here's your answer, I'm not FAT!!!! Thor:(sad naruto music plays in the background).
So Spider-Man, Wolverine and Thor were all featured in PlayStation trailers...
When does this come out 🗣🔥❗
I'd love to play this game if the playstation 5 wasnt still as hard and painful to find like finding glass in sand. I refuse 1000$+ on it. Everywhere else tho is always out of stock. Maybe in the year 2032 I can find one. Everyone will be after the playstation 6 by then.
Wow
blade of chaos
Look at atreus in the beginning scene he looks like he wears the helmet of loki but it just a dear
love how it starts with Atreus carrying a deer!!!
Thor gordo é oq esperamos
🙏🙏🙏🙏
DAY ONE KAUF 😱🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🥳
Don't forget to add the Arabic language, we are just as excited as you🔥🔥
Im gonna laugh if thoses 2 sled dogs are named Sköll and Hati
We hope that the game supports the Arabic language
This should be available on ps4 too
L3 R3 :>
Why is angraboda black? Is it a disguise or something?
Can’t wait to play this on my PS5 Slim.
Holy!
che, como que me sobra un riñon... un alma por un alma
Kratos and Atreus’ relationship is starting to remind me heavily of Bruce and Damien’s and I’m all for it.
i will buy it now
So this never comes for PC? Ok then Wukong xD
I need it for ps4
I the only one who hears the Josh Brolin's voice?
Nagger girls ?
Let me tell u... Kratos has seen enough big guys🤣...not that he's gonna fight everyone.. Hercules was big enough,
jacksepticeye needs to make a play through on this
❤️
Esses graficos estão um absurdo.
"Are you a calm and resonating person?" Kratos: "O"
Ready to game
Can i run this game in my core 2 duo windows xp😂😂
Thanks Barlog. You just saved me $60.00. Hey...why not a black Thor next time.
Angrboda was not black
I want to hate this game but i can't  put it in ps4 im not ready to buy ps5
Say wut? Opie as Thor? :O
Sony just can't stop taking W's
Atreus needs his own franchise
Ok, so it's gonna be a trilogy of games.
a world without humans and gods only playing with each other and demons.  It's boring.
một thế giới không có con người và các vị thần chỉ còn biết chơi với nhau và yêu ma. Thật là buồn chán 😣
@jacksepticeye needs to see this
I only have a PS to play GOW rest of the year it sits in the closet :D
Legacy of gow
L3+R3 = Rage 🔥🔥
The thor we want but the thor we got
My ps5 is being delivered today. This game looks insane. I cant wait to its released.
Is that game in ps4 and ps5?
Orang indo yg nungguin GOW dimainin sm qorygore like
3:05 Ahhh very Nordic
So glad mimir is back! He’s adopted now!
so sad that this is not for PC
"Are you a calm and reasonable person" Kratos: I was until I snapped your brothers neck
I had to Google who was the voice actor for Thor. It sounds like a mix of Josh Brolin and Djimon Hounsou. Ryan Hurst is a great choice.
all aboard the hype train
I just hope this is not the last game as kratos.
When SONY...
Wanjay yg di tunggu tunggu
When the PS5 will restock in India
Kratos: "War is not the only way. Killing them and ripping them apart is another option"
صبح صبح جيبه 😅💪
Is sony going to add it on ps4 pro  Or sony gonna a do scumbag way only playable on ps5
Please give me ps5 🎮🎮🎮
Rip thor
At this point Xbox may as well throw in the towel 😂
The game looks amazing but when you look minutely ....the graphics hasn't increased much from the 2018 version
:(
Did anyone notice that mimir has his other eye back
Almost axe throwing time 🪓
Peter Sipping here🍻
👍👍👍👍
PRECIO 🔥
Needs 300% more Boi.
Of course they had to include black character
So excited.
1:54
Kratos : BOI  Where is my BOI ? My little BOI
boy...
Why this content is age restricted.
Boy!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
so sad, go more black, no reason for it, but they do it for stereotypes, kek
KRATOS 💥💥💥💥
Godly
The Main Reason I Brought A PS5✊🏾💪🏾👍🏾💯
Trailer: perhaps Tyr still lives? Also Trailer: This is Tyr, he’s alive
GOW 1,2,3…Solo GOW 4, with son  GOW 5, more powerful with son!
Alright, I'm calling it.  Game of the year 2022
I didn't know black people existed in Norse Mythology.
I can't wait to play this game and horizon zero dawn: forbidden west!
Trashhhhh not another gears camera u had a chance to switch it up and already failed
Can't it be played on pc without using simulator?
Will it come for ps4 ?
Сцена в конце где мужик встаёт и по росту выше Кратоса просто смехотворная (для понимания вспомните каких гигантских титанов мочил Кратос к примеру в 3 части)
who needs to play, when u can just watch the trailer
Stay Calm Kratos  *L3* + *R3*
Ps4 game
PS4 Grafik? Sehr enttäuscht !
Those blades of chaos😍😱🔥🔥🔥🔥
LEGENDARY from the jump 🔥
Love playstation exclusives
Esta trilha sonora, esta fantastica.
Oh, of course... really had to do that. Yes... norse mythology.
Amazing ⚡
Outubro de 2022 a fevereiro de 2023
Ooooh yeah another GOW to plat!
I have a feeling that after we release Tyr, he will betray us or maybe one of the dwarfs, specially the one with the octopus, maybe he is a spy of Odin in Svartalfheim.    Forgot something, please, Mr Cory Barlog, please we want to see Atreus using Spartan Rage.
Noooooo😍😍😍😍😍
Buying a ps5 just for this!!!
didn't ended up well for Hercules, don't do the same mistakes as him Thor
I got chills when I heard the music
Last one was one of the best games ever, so I have high hopes for this one
i have a feeling that zeus is going to help odin at some point...after all we have seen zeus is still at hellheim!
No me lo puedo creer
Just watch the video on 0.25 speed. Thank me for showing you all the details you had missed.
You don’t know how excited I am for this
Can't wait to see its game play in YouTube(because I can't afford a Playstation)
Looks like trash
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: 1:57
BOY!
I kinda missed the quicktime events i hope they bring back a few
Does anyone else think that Angrboda's looks possibly imply that at least one giant might have married with people from the Egyptian/African land? Like, it would makes sense since the Jotun are hunted to extinction, the ones who chose to remain might opt for interracial marriage so their children do not inherit fully the racial feature of Jotun and thus doesn't get targeted easily, that's what happened to Atreus, he's a half Jotun looking like a Mediterranean boy

New deadpool game
Thanks for that little drop of wokeness at the end there. Can't have too many whites in there. We all know how racially diverse the Norse were after all. 🙄  Diversity box can be checked now. You've fixed racism! Congrats!
Game the deadpool
The Norse pantheon is gonna learn what happens when they push a guy who doesn't want to fight too far. Can't wait for this game!
I’ve watched this trailer at least 20 times
I hope the valkyries return to help because Kratos saved them from a fate worse than death
Controller: Another reason for you to smash me up  Player: Get ready...
No Aunt Jemimas in Norse mythology
Kratos :you coming with us Tyr : yes , let me get my guitar
Bet you can use tyr
Great
Prefiero los de ps2
BOY.
Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of Thor but I want Kratos to win this fight 💯
Thor what they did to you. We need a strong Thor with muscules, some Character to get hin seriously, not a Thor obsessed with Whopper double combo lol
the racists are so mad in the comments. stay mad 😂😂
im a t skinshop boot grass ice
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  BOI: What is that big red circle on his head? Kratos:*chuckles* Calmness... BOI, Calmness...
E  ps5  ps4   xbox   xbox  xs ? |
I am a calm and reasonable person until I want to see Kratos bury his axe into thors skull
The Silhouette of Atreus with horns 🥺
To those who have watch/ed this, out of curiosity. How many times have you watched this?
Tag qorygore broo
Im really sorry for those who own Xbox
BOI's voice has gotten deeper!
3:04 Token black character checked
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Uhhh... Yesn't
these are the games i sometimes consider buying a console sometimes. :/ guess ill just see someone on twitch or youtube play it
I swear if Boi shoots arrow one more time at us 😂
3:05 ???
THOOOOOR
Caraacaaaaaaaa
ما كولون شوكت تنزل 😭
Надеюсь, саун дизайнер (композитор) будет Bear McCreary?
Yall kill off my boy Kratos and we gonna have problems
will it be available for ps4?
Plz let it be available in pc too😭😭
Its official.... i have to buy a ps5
I hope tyr is an ally here
1:00-1:57 Can’t wait for the release of the soundtrack. Bear McCreary is the best composer.
only one question, when?
More I watch it,  more I love It. This game gonna be LEGENDARY.
Meh. I don't like Angrboda
Sorry but this doesn't look like very next gen (still cool but not jaw dropping technically speaking)
I don't have time to wait. Im to lazy to wait for this game. I want it NOW!         I have PS5
Listen to me to be effective in combat a warrior must not feel for his enemy the road ahead is long and unforgiving No place for a boy you must be a warrior!  Be ready Boyyyy!!! 👀
Are you a calm and a reasonable person?                        *Spartan Rage*
Geez Kratos is tall
Paaaaaa se consiga minita atreus\loki
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Greek Pantheon: “Yeahh… about that…”
❤
I've been waiting for this
When when when…..lol
When is this DLC coming out? Can’t wait to play it!!
Token of war
Well there is 6k xbox fan here
Kratos is the new Juliet lol💕
I don´t even have PS5 yet... feel´s bad man
Sakis Karpas Anastasis😂
I think I’ve watched this 30 times now. I can’t stop - please help 😕
After this Ragnarok. . , we are going to Egypt 🔥🔥🔥🔥😤🔥🔥😤 and wipe out their gods
Angrboda black, you seem to have lost your mind, this is discrimination
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
The Intro Gives me Viking Chills,Also Artreus voice is very Difference
I am so glad they diversified the cast! The game was way too bland and boring in terms of representation before anyway.  Thank you, Santa Monica studios!
Great now i'm missing the ps4 and ps5
Эту часть точно не куплю, удачи Вам с черными тонами.
Am i the only one thinking that this game has connection to marvel movies?
Black Angrboda?! It's ridiculous! Are you idiots?
Kratos is the original "Call the ambulance,but not for me"
Just Take my money already 😂😂
Just for PS5 or for PS4 too?
Im An X Box Guy...But For This Game.... I'll Be A Trator...😬
NO si también para la 4
Tyr looking down at kratos I thought he was a giant lol but then I remembered nope and kratos has battled bigger
Uaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuu
Had me up until 3:04 now I won’t be buying this game.  Thank you just saved me $75.
Me : Owh , Hello Papa Thor !
Don't tell me anything about expanded& enchanted im happy
I guess xbox and Nintendo players disliked this video 🤣
3:05 -_-
Why does it still look ps4 to me?!
Só esperando para jogar essa sequência maravilhosa e dublado em português Brasil 👍🏻😀
It is going to win GOTY award 2022 easily...
2023 😤
Wow amazing but what about ps4 people we deserve to play this awesome game 🤕
you know all that hype they did for Cyberpunk 2077? You can do for this one , this time you will not regret it !!
Скандинавская великанша негр...
The only Problem is i dont have a PS5-_-||
Thor want to know your location
Favorite game
사랑해.
Imagine after ragnarok when boy becomes big kratos always calls him man man maan maaaaan
Nuuuuu  Freyaaa :(
Gg
Real trailer ends at 3:00
Any one can tell me why they did not make a film for gow??
I bet she is alphabet comunity.
Estou ansiosos que lance o novo gow ps5 ótimo trailer do game
that was quick ngl 2018 seemed like it was yesterday
Atreus: "stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  Kratos: *inhales* "BOI!"
Woh woh woh was the that kratos freed zeus?? He seemed like zeus.
ادري ليش معاندين اللغه العربيه يعني نريد لغه عربيه
All I want is to just smash Thor’s head with his own hammer!
I have a hunch that opening scene will be the very beginning of the game. Much like the scene of Kratos cutting down the tree in the last game.
Love the cultural appropriation
Kratos + Mjolnir soon, soon 😦😧😨
The shivers i got from this trailes ...cant wait for it to releaseeeee
kurdi leya
@1:14 could those wolves be skoll and hati? The wolves who pursue the sun and moon?
Wow
I can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥
Blade's handle hits mimir's head always 😂
So we get whining teen as side kid this time....... Nice
Why this is not in hindi
Are you a calm and reasonable person?   *Spartan Rage Available* starts flashing
yes, but can we talk bount this: did freya just attacked kratos?
Black skin girl in north wood? What a rave! What is next afrovikings?
👍🏿
I cant tell but did Tyr have both his hands? I thought in myths Tyr lost his hand when he used it to distract Fenrir so they could bind him?
I dont really care about the race swap but they better not change the birth to her children just to see atrues and kratos face when she births a snake, a wolf cub and a half alive baby
Imagine kratos going alone against taliban
L3 + R3 RAGE
Tyr is huge
Oh, boy. Tyr still has both hands. That particular moment has not happened yet. I hope we get to see it. I hope we get to see the puppy.
Am i watching a movie or playing game
Bois the wait is over 🔥📍
Is it gonna be for ps4 too or only for ps5 I don't have the ment to buy a ps5
Ps4😭😭😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
One is "progress" and "diverse" while the other is "cultural appropriation" and "washing". Its funny how that works.
Ну и говно , Ангрбода чёрная? Тор жирный? Спасибо но я не копрофил. Оставьте свою игру себе.
So are we all ignoring Mimir writing/painting with his mouth? Cuz I like the jokes about Teenaged Atreus, Tyr with two hands, and ‘Calm and Reasonable’ too…but Mimir didn’t have to try this hard to be entertaining and he did. For us.
I'm not sure if it's intentional, but Atreus' clothes have similarities with those of a jester, a.k.a trickster. Im not sure if it's of nordic origin but i think it is an interesting design choice. Can't wait for GOW Ragnarok!
Thor: raids kratos with the whole Asgardian army  Kratos: calls all Greek giants for war and teams up with zues and all the Greek gods  Thor: Scared for his life  Asgardian army: Naah we don't get treated well enough for this so the army leaves  Thor: states in the arms of hades for ever Kratos:  ends up killing everyone except atrues  Kratos: MUAHAHAHA
Kratos can defeat the whole world of  he clicked circle ⭕ enough number of times
Thor  🔥🔥
Every comment is getting 1K + plus with the same comment others have done already lol 😹😹😹
Is this linked with thor series?
Legit can't wait to play this already >:c
GOTY
At the same time, I'm disappointed and excited.
The great moment is, Atreus its growing up now
My favourite hero ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kratos:i dont want war because i fear i will wipe them out even with me having a third of my power. Loki:so lets go ti war. Kraros:no
Yessssssss
เทพเจ้าหัวนมดำ
tyr will help kratos for sure, because tyr also help faye escape from odin
😘
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" "No!" Ryan hurst in Thor's voice: "I got this"
Badass
❤️❤️
Oh, very nice👍🏼. Black character in Scandinavian norse mythology. Stupid resolution, Santa Monica!
Did gods created this game ? How in the world is this possible...
When the game is releasing?????
اكو عرب بلطياره😂
"You must prepare your wallet"
Excelente trailer! Esperando el juego. Desde Panamá 🇵🇦
And in the direction of deer he went
Xbox kids crying in corners
Will this release on PS4?
جماعة الاكس بوكس مضغوطين عني يابة عني 🍋
2:12 Lite version of Hades 😂
I forgot how long it has been waiting in the blurry memory full of questions and finally Kratos and his Boy are here, I'm just so excited!
But Tyr lost his arm to the wolves
Ah yes. Another YouTube exclusive. For free by the way.
Хуетааааааа, 3 часть 🤣
Badges man that's all I have to. Badass. Cannot wait for t this
If this is based on norse mythology how is there a black female in the end. Is she Egyptian because that would be cool.
Thor: Kratos plz help me defeat thanos Kratos: LEAVE MY FCKING HOME!
Yo solo queria a Mimir de nuevo hablandonos sobre los Dioses y sus planes, gracias.
Ps5 has a zoom option like ps4?? It was so usefull for glass people. Put on please.
Mazz🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who watched this many time 👋
Shall it available for PS4 pro
So nobody going to talk about how Freya almost broke Kratos shield with one one strike
Que buen juego, el tyr es un pedazo de doctor segun lo que me contaron
❤❤❤
Please dont kill kratos is this game,  waiit till the 3rd one at leassst
0:19 loki🤔
@Pmack448
Why Atreus sound like Marty mcfly?
At least the Valkyries aren’t in this one…..right? 🥺
Graphics are bad
too bad its near impossible to get a ps5 right now
Me encantaaaaaaaaaaaa
Story>gameplay.
I wonder if this game is going to have a potential co-op segment where one player gets to play as Tyr and the other Kratos.
CARALHO!!!!!
Marvel trailer?
So the death of our hero is near
what about PS4?
Saldra para ps4 ?
Ps4 já era né Sony eu sei que vocês nem vai ler mas a realidade do Brasil é outra aqui impostos são altíssimos vocês não dão a mínima para o Brasil e aqui possui muitos gamers que ainda possui um ps3 por não ter dinheiro para comprar um ps4 muito menos um ps5 que em muitas lojas estão 5 mil 6 mil isso é um absurdo vocês devem exigir preços mais justos para seus consoles eu queria jogar gow ragnarok mas não vou pq não tenho o ps5 e nem dinheiro para comprar o ps5 eu nunca iria pagar 6 mil em um videogame poxa já tô cansado de ver videogames de vocês aqui no Brasil em preços absurdos exigem que seus consoles sejam vendidos com preços mais acessíveis
This one's who owns ps4 going to get access to the game?
Ну как же без чёрной женщины, в северной Скандинавии то
Still not the kratos who used to be in ps2/ps3 RIP kratos 2018
Top
My man Kratos is getting old 😪 😢
I like kratos ❤️
❤❤
Looks like they're going to go woke I already hate it
Xbox players rn 😭😭😭
I hope we get more than two weapons.
THOR >>> kratos
Holy Christ
That's not Tyr! That's f***king Keanu Reeves!!!
Can we get single person playing without anyone talking all the time?
Maybe people can actually buy a non scalped PS5 by the time this game comes out
Why does everyone hate Thor?
If there was any word for how much i can't wait for this to come out
What if Kratos' death makes Atreus cause Ragnarok? 🤔
Solo se que lo jugaré en el año 2100
ASSIM CÊ MATA PAPAI SANTA MONICA MEU DEEEEUS
War is not the only way. Look who's saying it 😂😂
Look at Boy all grown up!
Don't even own a PS4 or 5 but I'm still hyped
I can’t wait to get this game
Graphics look the same
PlayStation 2 👍 legend
Ooo the game is epic
1:48 This game has giant Frog people that I can kill, that is honestly the main reason why I want to buy it.
Why the need to race-swap? That's weak.
Kratos is big.                       But Tyr is bigger.
Can’t wait😁
Que hace una persona morena en la parte nórdica? 😐 por favor play Station, no te pongas inclusivo incoherentemente....Ojalá tenga una explicación lógica...
Eu sou brasileiro
FANTASTIC
If you notice Freya’s sword cuts clean through the shield. Something even Magni and Modi couldn’t do....  Could she be wielding the Legendary sword of Summer, sharpest blade in the nine realms?
So woke won again and took a dump all over another well liked game. Its like a freaking fetish with these people.
待っていた…この時を…
Cuando pasó Kratos de Grecia a Países nórdicos? 🤷🏾‍♂️🥶
Mokka commentary army
I wonder when Atreas finds out kratos backstory?? Or will he ever know
Take my money 💰 lol
Noobmaster69 awaiting to poke Thor again with the help of Kratos this time
Did you just try to race swap in a game about Norse mythology? Excuse me? I was told that race swapping was racist.
would have been better without the race swapping its norse mythology, not african.
Aaaaaaaaa increíble
1:12 broooo I love seeing the blades of chaos and his frost axe on his back at the same time😩👌🏼
Wow.  Black angrboda.  Wow.
bring it to PC
Boi
only for ps5?
parece un dlc del anterior no un juego nuevo
Sigh..gonna be a lot of people calling in sick again
I know there are people out there shittalking this and I'm open for a reasonable explanation...  Why is a nordic character black?
PS4?
Poor Thor
I’m so excited for this adventure
op
"Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general"  Ehm kid, the last time he do that, he wiped out the Pantheon single handedly.   if you have no idea how crazy it was, imagine if he going to asgard or crossing the brigde of the damned and crazy enough to fight every single gods and creature in there.
1:50 Is BOI also using The Blades Of Chaos
murzyn
So when kratos threw his axe into the lake of 9 and it was infused with the world serpents venom. So technically the world serpent can still kill Thor with his venom being in the axe. If time travel does happen in the game!!
Will it be available in PS4???
قربت
Still watching this
Why is there a black girl in this?
Cool, but Angrboda shouldn’t be black. Her skin should be more of a gray.  Norse mythos figures reflect those who wrote them IE the Norse people’s who were white. The Jötunns are described as being dark, but not in our modern interpretations of skin color. They were dark like literally grays and actual black.
chains are baaackkk
Will this be relesed for ps4 pro????🥺
Agh Atreus hit puberty
So are they making more ps5 or I’m just gonna wish I had this game 😂
Who ever thinks Kratos is "calm and reasonable" obviously haven't seen him during his prime. =))
Awesome, another PS5 game I’ll never get to play
The great lizard that it watch on video is the NIDHOGG. It is the monster of ragnarok 💪💪💪💪
I have a question Atreus holding a deer at start is this the deer Atreus summons?
Shield of sun👌🏼💖
So Atreus can ride deer now
Who is that black girl? Is the Norse setting not only getting invaded by Greeks like Kratos but also Africans?
3:06 That`s the only reason I disliked this  no ebony in norse mythology  no ebony in norse mythology  no ebony in norse mythology  no ebony in norse mythology  no ebony in norse mythology
Seems epic, waiting for the game release!
Оооо да, мы дождались, как же я долго спускаю на этот трейлер🥴
Me who owns an Xbox one
Nice, will play it for sure...if it reaches PC
Why do they always have to mix some original characters with some other ethnicities...if they are trying to be really mythologically accurate..  But this looks to be a fckn banger
"BOY" Is back
Finally, best thing that’s happened to me this year
Only one question remains: when can I buy a PS5?
kratos in 2020:you must prepare yourself its end of 2021 and we dont have a release date i was prepare for 1 year
30 fps, we meet again.
I need a new pair of pants!
PlayStation you're great 💯💯👏👏
Ps4 ?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
🤦🏻‍♂️
Why does he sound a little bit like tom holland?
HYYYPEDDDD
It would be awesome to see enemies related to the treasures, to make it seem like those treasures haven't been put there specifically just for Kratos to find. For example other parties also looking for the powerful artifacts or whatever riches they may have in those chest.
Has no limits is right
Just loved the deer ramming those guys
Dad of boi 2: the lanky years
War… War never changes.
Read it boi!
Versión ps5 RTX On ?
Calm and reasonable? Iam 100% sure that he wants to invite him to the avengers
Now this game is becoming something that anyone can’t  guess..where it will be end ….❤️
Atreus : Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general for once !  Zeus's ghost : Haha ... hahaha .... are u dumb ?
One of the greatest game ever made along with Assassins Creed Valhalla💪😎🤜!!
Are you a calm and reasonable person?
The dislikes in the video are from Asgardians
Va salir para ps 4?
Can watch this trailer all day long. Looking forward to this game!
جميل جدا ورائع 🥰🥰🥰🥰+اول عربي
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Everybody gangster until ⭕️ starts floating on there head
I'm hyped AF!!
Efsane
Boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii….. thats going to be the game of the year
- What are we hunting? -YOU are hunting deer. -OK.. Which direction? -IN the direction of deer.  FF 3 years... Atreus hunts the deers now 🤔
I happy
was wondering if anyone else noticed that freya's attack broke kratos' shield
1:55 noooo nooo shoot xd
The enviroment looks like mount Kilimanjaro in Africa 2:21
Качественный перевод от Яндекс ;D
Xd
Ps4 graphic… what a mess
Atreus- Think like a general Kartos-        Exactly!!
brou you are -----up
Boooy is back !
I'm so excited for this.
Spartan Vs Asgard who would have thought 😂
It’s definitely not gonna happen but here’s to the dream of Thor helping Kratos stop Ragnarok from arriving early
Hmm. Loki. Angrboda. Waiting on a certain futuristic mutt.
Like For Quality
Are Tyr allies?
Cool token diverse character lol
Are Tyr allies?
kratos cannot get away from his nature either
Better armor design none of Norse demigods are wearing heavy armor due to their nature and neither did Kratos wore much armor back in Sparta yet here all high-end gear is so bulky and awful looking it just doesn't fit a spartan mentality or Norse. Oh yeah, by the way, lose the pants.
No tengo pley 5 😭😭😭
Undercovered underwater areas should not have the same enemies as the levels above, I mean how did they get there! They just happened to be able to breathe underwater and above! How about in cases like that aviary enemies that see new land make their way there by flight.
I feel like I'll see the old Kratos in this game.
Tyr is so fking massive, twice the size of Kratos
Thor look like the father of Ippo from how to train your dragon, please do him more scary… magni can’t be more impressive than Thor  I’m no talking about weight….
Oh look more race spinning from white to black.
Please launch it on ps4 pro
1:05 Santa Monica pls give us this music theme!
00:57 notice how Freya's strike was either so fast that she outpaced the shield unfolding, or so strong she forced a gap onto it's form.  Remember, Sigrun was a regent queen, if the second Norse saga game doesn't give us an even crazier boss fight in Freya, I'll riot.
Reminds me of PlayStation 4
Chests and loot need to be improved upon, positioning of chests need to be organic and make sense like for example, the ones inside sunken lost ships are acceptable yet the ones just covered by flimsy wood planks that are so easily detectable make no sense that only Kratos would be able to find those plus it makes no sense for those minor and high-end chest to be there at all besides pure convenience. Something that is been bugging me is that they never explain how Atreus knife opens the magical chests I get that his mom carved that knife for him with some type of magical power yet there is no build-up for that he just does it when he had no clue that the knife had any type of magical powers, he just shoves into the crack. Even if he was clever enough to figure that crack fit the knife he never comments about it after how he figured that out on his own, unless I missed it.
Thor hands looks very fat
Am I the only one who sees that kratos has a new shield
nope
@miawaug
Fully expecting atreus to say “angrboda wanna roll with a geezer”
For those who don't like to rely on a compass, we should be able to open the main bap at a press of a button or 2 max.
Nawet dupy nie chciało się ruszyć aby zrobić animację, nie widzę żadnej różnicy między poprzednia częścią, może jedynie to że poprzedni gow był całkowitą odskocznią od gow3 i dlatego się przyjął. Odgrzewany kotlet, pozdro :/
who is the last man, saved by kratos?
Why kratos don't say:BOY......😂 I mean BOOOOOOYYYYY
who's the tall guy in the last scene
I know I’m probably late to the party, but I’m guessing that’s Skol and Hati pulling the sled, only two wolves and one is white the other black.
🙂
Why u dont give USB or Wireless keyboard & Mouse Support for all PS Games?? If U give this feature PC gamers will forget PC's and Ur PS gonna be at TOP of Gaming Platform..Think on It..PC gamers are used to Keyboard and Mouse specially for Aiming in Action Games..Joystick is annoying at some points for Aim in games..
wooowwwwwwwwwww.....
I dont care what people think, but I want thor to win
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person ?  Shows kratos explode a enemy
Brasil
atreus you never know what your dad do, stop asking ahahaha 😂
“ Mom can we have pizza “   Mom : 1:57
راح العب اللعبة في 2026
Will this be on ps4??
So what happens to the loot and the data from the previous one when we move to ragnarok ?
Santa Monica: why are people complaining about Thor being fat? We are just following the source material!!!!   Also Santa Monica:  LeTS mAkE ANgRbOda BlACk
Wow
Афроамериканка уже есть в игре, ну теперь можно играть спокойно.
Is it just me or the graphics look very similar to the gow 4?
black angroboda...huh.
Yahoooooooo
If the logo of gow ragnarok hyped all gow fans, imagine this
Thor:you seem like a calm and reasonable person  Kratos be like: where are my blades of chaos!!!
restock more ps5 please?...thanks
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: Mimir says you're a fat dobber. Mimir: And a sweaty bawbag too!
So it's ps5 only?
Indonesia kumpul sini ⬇️
Kratos is not going stop ragnarok, Kratos is ragnarok
The game of the year is coming ! (Every year)
oh no !! Again with his boy :(   !?
Why wont there be a roblox psvr with and roblox with no VR with wireless controller
Kratos: "In moments of Crisis xbox does nothing, harness it let Playstation serve you"  Direct quote....ragnarok is coming
Atreus : Start think like General  Kratos : Boy , last time I think like that . That didn't go well.🔥🔥🔥
Yes yes yeeeeeeesss
Это будет ох..нно
Oh I can't wait
Man I wish this was on PS4. This is beautiful
Joggers, joggers everywhere
I'm waiting Santa Monica ❤❤
1:28 left guy at the docks has trouble getting up the stairs :)
Please Corey don’t turn GOW into some woke shi*
Freya está un poquito enojada
Brabox🔥
When is the game playable?
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼plz make a PS4 version
I hope old man Kratos has learnt how to translate the runes on his own cuz he won't go far if his cheeky boi is at large making Ragnarok happen
Gods* of war then
1:27 dragon, top left corner
This trailer has alot of scenes that spark alot of energy. One of these scenes is tyr standing up to be as bis as almost 2 kratos and the way he looks down at kratos is 👌
he grow up so fast
Yeah this gonna be great just by the looks of it 😊👍....
Tyr stands up..... Kratos reacts(Deadpool sees Juggernaut)
Pls release on ps4
Anyone else notice the two sled dogs they have are grey and white? Skjoll and hati? The wolfs they chase the sun and moon and bring RAGNAROK
Shut up boy
I have a feeling that what they showed here is only a pinch of a whole sack 👀👀
I wonder if kratos still gonna call his son "Boi"
I whish i could play it
Ac Valhalla hiding in shock
This is the 4th time of me watching this and don't call me crazy.
everything is great, of course, but this truly Scandinavian girl at the end confused me a little, it will be funny if Kratos gets on one knee in front of her😀😀😀😀
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person   Kratos : Adjusting  the chains of blades of chaos
THOR: You look like a calm and reasonable person THE ENTIRE GREEK PANTHEON: We assure you he is not!!!
I am verrrry excited
2:00 thanos?
Does this in any way look better than GoW on ps4? I'm not saying it has too, I'm just curious if any of you can spot anything that has improved graphics wise.
💯🔥
at what part does Atreus give birth to a horse
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ragnarok destroy the internet
Who is Tyr btw?
Only for PS 5? ☹️☹️☹️
2:12 Is this an Einherjar?
I was expecting some greek slaughter survivors to make a cameo but oh well
Why people discus about Tyr hand?  What happen?
Black Giantess from the North.  It's just brilliant!
This game launch in ps4
nice,its my love game
In fact when Thor said “Are you a calm and reasonable person” and immediately reveal his Hammer, was an indication for that the only reason and logic that Thor knows is “prepare yourself for death”.
I love GOW Olympus
I think everyone should have more than one PS4/PS5 consoles just in case one of them explode from the excitement and over load actions! Then you could use the 2nd console 😁
Looks amazing
NICE
BEST ALL Time
This is the 10th time I’ve watched this. Probably going to watch another 100.
BEST
PLEASE LET US USE THOR HAMMER
Had me until the last couple seconds
Tyr guy I I don't remember him can anyone tel me
only for ps5?😠
Is thor voiced by josh brolin
Let’s gooooooooooooooooo I’m ducking ready for this game to come out
It's the best I've seen for 2021
sweet!
"im in euphoria!... is this what it feels to be in euphoria? cause I'm feeling pretty f@#$% euphoric right about now!" -something i think Brok would say if he saw the trailer and felt what I felt.
Why does Angrboda's character look like Christopher Judge? I can't unsee it now...
We want Previous Angry Kratos ❤️
this needs to come to pc mannnnnnnnnnnnnn
He surely memorized the way of deer.
I must say, I love the looks of Thor here. I don't know why people are laughing at his body when in Norse mythology he's depicted that way.
only ps5????
Atreus is a coward kratos so let this kid know who's boss
wow
الدي مو عاجبني صوت شخصية ابن كريتوس احسها مرة ناعمة نبي صوت فخم
why black woman?
İm watch the legend
Yes yes yesssssssssssss!
Hopefully it’s out on PS4 as well😮‍💨
*BOIIIIIIIIIII*
Totalmente diferente como o pessoal acreditava q seria vai ser top só n sei se vai ter pra versão pro ps4
BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
choose difficulty: 1-pussy 2-pussy 3-pussy 4-God of war
30fps garbage.
White washing history again at the end. Making characters non-white.
Okay... Okay... Thor is Tyr?
The Way Tyr Standing Make me Remember When Kratos Fight Hercules !!! you know what happen next.
Nice
Horn of loki at tje beggining of this trailer, love this.
لا اله الا الله
😍😍😍❤
Can’t wait to play this
Boi - stop thinking like a father , think like a general . Keratosis - No (inner - say no more)
Tyr looks like younger zeus ngl
Where are the Xbots? I need some company in these harsh time knowing that Ragnarok will never come to Xbox. Time to sell my car to buy a PS5 I guess.
why tf is atreus skin so smooth, in gow 4 he was covered in mud like where is he taking a shower.
I hope kratos next journey japan mythology.  like amaterasu,susano'o,tsukuyomi,kaguya hime,izanagi no okami etc.
Hopefully this game is so outstanding that when someone says Thor they think of a fat dude fighting Kratos rather than a Disney character.
Wow , I was waiting for this moment
Coming to pc
This is the hype
Wow wow 😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘
grazie di tutto PS!!!
где то насилие из-за которого я полюбил эту игру !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:53 aaawww man
Boy how you've aged
too Ecxited😊😊
Збс збс
To me, Tyr looks too much like a young version of Zeus.
Even tho this game doesn’t look like a graphical masterpiece for next gen but playing it in smooth 4k 60fps is gonna be sooo much fun.
My favourite game
Ooohhh kretchuns
Er mah gawd!
holy -
Is it me or the leviathan axe looks smaller and wierd??
த‌மிழ் வேண்டும்
Huginn & Muninn at 1,17.....
Ragnarok is coming
كلو jق
Kratos: im 6'5" and 225 lb Tyr: oh yeah?  **Tyr stands up**
1:58
1:58
1:58
Hope that it release on ps4 too
Is this a dlc or a new own game
Far away better than GTA V next gen ps 5
Are these ps5 graphics? Looks like old gen
BOI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ريد نسخ الا خير من العب
ريد نسخ الاخير
My All Time Favourite Game 👌
I don’t like the way thor looks     he looks like a fat hillbilly
Carryminati
Yr iski aawaaz
Anyone saying that the visuals in this are disappointing needs to get their eyes checked!
When is it coming in the cinema?
Thor: "are you a calm and reasonable person?"   Kratos: "ask your sons"
But the graphics are disappointing
Thor is still not there... Btw who's waiting for Loki to be featured???
Game of the year
the girl its son of kratos
Quien es el Gigante que sale al final?😭😳😳😳
The music is amazing
Madre miaaaa me vuelvo locooooo!!!! Aaaaaaa
This trailer lacked a lot of *BOIIIIII*
Time for father and son to unite and save everyone! Why? Because that's what heroes do!
It would be funny if Zeus came back and tell krato look at my son after all these years..
Thor : “You seem like a calm and reasonable person, You wanna play GWENT?”. Kratos: //nods
Tanto tiempo para algo que parece mas un DLC.
Cade o comentário do Luan?
Não gostei muito do gráfico da água 😔
وااااااااو متحمس نار
@miawaug
Fake mythology
😁
Objective:survive untill 2023
se nota el trabajo que ha hecho santa monica, este trailer me lleno de emocion e ilusion, este juego brillara en el combate, sera glorioso
For me, it's just this and after - 2:11 It sends chills down my spine
at 2:02 please tell me that is josh brolin voice
Daam
Dios ojala los combos no sean los mismos que del 4 porque si no le quita la gracia Deberian haber nuevas armas con nuevos combos o tener nuevas habilidades con las mismas armas Pero en lo personal creo que vendria perfecto una mecanica nueva
Kratoz morirá 😞😞😞
So
Seeehs
EPICO!!!!!
i want this game
Tyr: two hands  Fenrir: allow me to introduce myself
Well the kid is still annoying
Bois,we are back in business
Politically forced inclusion activated. For more reference visit the minute 3:05 of the video.
Черные викинги,да….
The Best game
Jokes aside. Having Atreus come into frame carrying a deer was smart. He's beginning to come to terms with his place in the world.
Tyr looks like a young Saruman LOL
someone called it dad of sad 2 and now i cant stop laughing
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEESHHH
Ñ
5.5K Xbox gamers viewed this video
No one gonna talk about atreus voice ?
1:58
Wow
I’m going to hate the girl simply on principle
NOOO ITS AGE RESTRICTED!
Take ur time do it right it looks amazing this exceeded my expectations!
I actually physically cried watching this
Man I can't wait to beat Thor's, from his own hammer🤤🤤
thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: I'm going to kill you with your own hammer
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  "Yes." *Holds out Blades of Chaos*   "Meet Calm and Reasonable."
Atreus is back pack kid
Já até imagino o final do game. Kratos lutando com o Odin, aí o Kratos tá dando porrada no Odin e depois de muito tempo o Odin consegue ferir feio o Kratos, deixando ele perto da morte.Atreus fica furioso fazendo com que ele venha desperta um novo poder e luta contra o Odin e consegue vencer. Meio Clichê, mais é um bom final
Atreus: stop acting like a father and start acting like a general Greek: 01:57
Is Thanos Voicing Thor?
Epico , sem mais
Ragnarok is coming
Welcome to dad of BOY!! Ragnarok
Kinda boring!
Boyyyyy!!
I would've liked a better trailer has at least a teaser of a fight with Thor and a start of Ragnarok, it would be such a disappointment if Ragnarok didn't start in the game and if it started as the legend Thor would be the one who will save Asgard so you got Kratos to distroy it .. Sony you're under a very big challenge with GOW series right now .. we expect the best
pink guy: the war is coming.... frankkuuuu
This is a  babaBOI moment
W0ke Garbage
God's back.D
This video should have more views,  and seen that ign has almost the same amount as this video means that it should have at least 8 to 9 million at this point
Atreus is Low key Loki
Ok graphics was impressive in PS4 but not in PS5 so…
Atreus: Don't hold me back father! I am no longe a boi!! Kratos: You're not ready yet... tiin!
Only in ps5? Ps4 yes or no ?
I’m so excited I hope it release on ps4 🤍🤍🤍
Imagine we get to use Mimir as some sort of special fighting ability like he bites someone or something.
is it also for p4?
This game will come out before more PS5 consoles will
Tyr!!! El mismisimo Tyr!!! Necesito que ya salga este juego! ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪💪💪
30 fps game trailer in 2021...
1:17 i can see zeus 😳
I want that black coat all the game long, it gives a stronger feel to kratos i think, epic!!! Cant wait
It's insane I'm crazy to play game.
i want ps5 plz (its joke)
Quem não gostou, pau no teu avo
❤
My wife's boyfriend is gonna be so happy to see black washing of European heritage.
New ship Angrboda x Atreus this logic
Well
هلا هلا
What about Ps4.!?
*Yes kratus Yes!*
I hate how they have to be “inclusive “ with everything now
Caraca nuca vou joga kkkkkkk
Wanted them to revive another weapon like the barbarian hammer
T_T 😢  Thor
Kratos is not his biological father... I bet $1.5
Love
Интересно, кто сильнее: Кратос или Скорпион? "Get Over Here!"
What a black character forgot in European, Scandinavian mythology. Whites worshipped in their own image. Don't try to insert and falsify something that didn't exist, but create other, new stories and universes if you have nothing to take from your own.
I love it but it almost feels like a DLC.
Cuando sale a la venta
Are you a calm and reasonable person? Thoooooor
😍😍😍
ps4 graphics no more else
PS4?👀
Sony deja de cagarla ,Ryan no seas tan incompetente ,dejen de sacar exclusivos en PC , hay una reputación que mantener, play station es grande y no gracias a la comunidad de PC, Kratos es nuestro ,abrí los ojos Ryan . AGUANTE LAYDEN!!!
>Black girl
Esto va a ser epico papus
Man I'm hyped about this
Only Thor comments here xD
Should of been called Fimbulwinter.  Then the 3rd Ragnorok.
Not impressive .. need bigger enemies
Ahh kids causing problems since the dawn of time...
El mejor juego de la Historia 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 Saludos desde🇵🇪

Man the scene with Tyr was so cool. Can't wait till we get to see the game.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cant wait   To watch whole gameplay of this game cause I aint buying a console for 1 game
Now let's NOT destroy the experience with greed aka Micro-trash-actions
In 2022 best year for Sony xD Horizon, GT7 and GOW, my boddy is ready XD
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person ?  *RAGE OF SPARTA THEME STARTS*
For ps4? 😭😭😭
Nu takoe
I think Odin will successfully capture Atreus and when atreus met tyr it was Odin in disguise...its just a theory of mine
😍 Mimir  hope mimir get back his body or new body
🔥🔥🔥
thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person. kratos: boi, hold my beer
Rockstar games : Would you like Gta 5 on Ps5? Me : 1:57
Viva a Playstation 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Everyone talk about Thor and me is like Odin will be big final boss and i want to see him xd

Hands down Game of The Year !! ❤️❤️
Trailer most beathiful i have see
La gente quejándose de thor porque no es como lo ven en Marvel  giles csm 😂😂😂

Alguien en español?
This is already game of the year
@trực tiếp game
Atreus: stop thinking like a father think like a general Kratos: you comedy me?
*🆎 . 🅾️ aynen cko epic ve legendary moment olmasını beğendim 😐 . ✌️*
Well his beard has not grown since then.
"Гадов Вор" поставил чёрную галочку в нужной графе, кек
A white man wearing dreads is cultural appropriation but putting black people in nordic mythology is okay???? What would happen if African gods were represented as white people what would happen???? They won't see the color of my money.
Game is going to be fire, But if they do a Real Life Movie that will be huge!
I am curious what are the names of two wolves the sleigh was pulled by…
Ps MASTER race.
From Greek mythology to Norse.... Noice.
Nice
DLC
Было бы прекрасно ремейки с первую по 3 части.
ya den fecha perrrossssssss
Is Josh Brolin voicing Thor?
I know you are excited to see mimir again
This is merely a DLC to GOW4.. not sequel sigh!
everyone is greedy these days ... you can clearly see that the graphics between PS4 Pro and PS5 is not that much different considering the wait ... and I bet Santa Monica Studio could have easily released this game for PS4 with closure on Nord Myth rather than forcing fans to buy a console to play their new release ... that's like Microsoft or Apple making you buy a new computer each time they release a major OS version.
Chale y yo con mi PS3 xd
Looks like the Boy is a Lad now
Santa Monica Studios do be levelling up their game.
disculpenme pero no le veo diferencia grafica a la ps4.....en mis tiempos si se notaba 8 a 16 bits ejemplo...y hasta en ps2 a ps3 incluso
Still can't get over how absolutely gigantic Tyr is. And I thought Kratos was a big guy
Is that an Asgardian at 2:14
Is it me or does kratos looks much stronger and scarier in this one
Oh yeah mosaji i will buy this game in any cost
top
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought cool! Battling stuff in Norse mythology but your Actually mutilating Viking Culture it is Cultural Appropriation! I definitely will not buy this game.
Noooooooo.... Q emoción el tráiler buenísimo...
Looks like a dlc
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for once and start thinking like a general. Kratos: Boy if you say that one more time...
I wonder if the writer realised that the only black character they shoe horned / race changed in is the mother of monsters. Not sure if this is supposed to be based or woke.
Did Kratos' voice actor changed? The Ragnarok one seems more raspier than the before ones.
Demasiao’ 🥲🤤❤️‍🔥
Also am I the only one that feels tier is just gonna grab you by the throat and throw you out of that room and is gonna go for Loki hard
Those wolves have to be the wolves that chase the sun and moon . Fenrirs kids
Atreus : He's taller than you dad, he's gonna beat you up. Kratos : *_Mind your tongue, Boi!_* anyway, wanna come up with us?
If the trailer looks epic, imagine how the game would turn out. My mind is bloed!!!!🤯🤯🤯
oooow its onnnn
WE
Xbox is pooping in their draws. Can’t wait for these games
guys i still have ps3 i can't even buy ps4 because so expensive here ps5 is cost 15 million dinars
Don't think they revealed so many details but think only that trailer is badass even though there  are so many details but trailer is pretty impressive and exited
Now just gotta find a PS5!!! @sony
Atreus : Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general Us : Be careful what you wish for, punk 😅
Fun fact: According to ancient Norse lore, Tyr is supposedly regarded as an Ancestor to the Swedish people.
Yeee we get to fight beta
Who else is hyped
WEEEEEEEY SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
This is rather not work
in future  i will play
Kratos: Are you coming with us? Tyr: Why not !
Do you think kratos will fight heimdall the guard of bifrosr bridge ?
C’est beau bordel
Atreus wears at 0:20 the Loki Helmet
Kratos says to Tyr: I think we have the same profession.
Angrboda is the woman who birthed the monsters of Norse mythology. The ones that will usher in the end of the Norse pantheon. She lives in the forest of iron and sleeps with wolves ffs... And you made her black? Why? That's... Kinda racists..  Why not Skade or something?
ps4 graphics
I have one question? Is it going to be on pc?
В игру про викингов-обязательно надо добавить негров!
At end of i dont know come to ps4 or not😐😑
YES YES YES YES YES
Oł yeah
The graphics are not inhanced 😭😭😭
I thought this game will release this year 🥲
Wow owo wow wow
Feel like Atreus by the end of this game will officially become the most powerful Loki Variant
and here is why santa monica Studio is better than rockstar
Exited to see kratos vs thor end boss fight there fight will be insane and more brutal
Atreus: i just want answers!! but what about the Mimir's wise brain
This is sick👍❤
Ps4 e ps5
I just want to say F**k my school I will gonna skip for Ragnarok
Deberían sacarse otro uncharted
Finally a reason to buy ps5... Cant wait to get this ps5 killer apps🙃
Am I the only one who feels this ps5 still looks the same as the ps4 pro. And it will look different on the ps5 pro series. It's just personal imagination. Sorry if I said wrong
Will this game launch on ps 4
KRATOS STILL A BAD*SS IN HIS OLDIES
Game of thrones vibe
In case anyones wondering the name of the girl at the end in ANGRBODA
Oh yeah...oh yeah oh yeah
I want to play this on PC so bad
What a game Sony👍  Love ❤ your games😘
It's sad but this game will be the only only reason I buy a PS5. And for the new Persona game :(
Por que me enviaron una notificación en gmail
1:05
I feel like the high frame rates definitely take the Cinematic feel out of things
Does it work on ps4
Theory Time: Each paragraph is a seperate theory.  hmm so im 100% sure odin and freya is working together on killing kratos, since freya attacked kratos, and we know from what freya told us is that she cant attack anyone, physical or magically, so odin mustve allowed freya to only attack kratos or dispell it completely   1:15 those crows are definitely odins crows.  1:20, atreus has a world serpent metal thing on his left shoulder, i cant help but to compare it to kratos omega symbol where he has his axe. atreus world serpent symbol might be for either his bow, kinda doubt that tho, or a new weapon, or he'll inherit the axe. it cant be for the quiver since he has that on his waist now. nvm apparently it is for his bow, for some reason he dosnt have it strapped around his chest anymore.  1:30, f yeah baby, were finally going to travel to svartalfheim, most likely, since it looks like there are many dwarfs and sindri even says "come in" like its an invitation to his own house, which prolly exist in svartalfheim.  2:12 we might be fighting asgardian next or maybe warriors that went to valhalla and is now used as pawns to odin to fight us, since that beam reminds me of the bifrost beam that heimdal sends thor to earth and such in the marvel movies.  3:06 it kinda looks like thats in vanaheim but from what weve been shown in a picture of angrboda, it says shes a giant, its possible since she said "you will have your answers" probably referring to atreus since he wanted to find out who he is and who loki is. but she kinda reminds me of freya with her hair, decorations in her hair and those marking except freyas are dark blue/greyish, so if that "angrboda is a giant" thing is false, shes most likely a vanir "goddess".  For now thats about it for my theories, mightve missed some, might be wrong about some of them or all of them, or i mightve actually nailed everyone of them.
Thor: You can't beat me *Suddenly "O" appears above his head* Kratos: 😏 Thor: Odindammit
Just FOR ps5?
0:11 when you look close enough Kratos looks right into your Soul
Lol can ps studios ever comit to a voice actor and stick with it
Please launch in ps4 also
Is this for PS4 to
2:21 tobi kadachi?

Aku ingin memainkan iniiiii cepeeet dong realis nyyaaaaa a
Dios Mio!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Pov : u don't have a PS4 or PS5 but still excited for the game to come out
Fill in the blanks  5.3K dislikes on this Trailer are from ______.
Can we expect Asgard in this ?
Finding Odin is easier than finding a ps5
"stop thinking like a father once and start thinking like a general" boy you have no idea what happened last time he started thinking like a general
adolescent Atreus
All jokes of Spartan Fury and finishing moves apart on the scene where Thor meets Kratos apart, am I the only one who is actually expecting a calm and reasonable answer from Kratos, like "As long as no one messes with my family" or something?
Will the game have a Russian dubbing?
Every people watching this trailer was most excited for the full game
1:08  Well, I recognize that dour expression anywhere :)
Letsshjsjsjsjw
The game is gonna be crazy. Don't rush the game take breaks and stay healthy.
Freza is going insane
PS4: ._____.
Best trailer of the year
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: *square* *square* *triangle*
I Hope There Is No Multiverse Here!
Still cant get over "are you coming with us scene 😭😭😭"
Kto był w ostatniej scenie?
It will be huuuuuuuuge
Según la Mitos Nórdicos los Æsir y los Vanir van a Acabar con el último Jotun al mismo tiempo Jörmundngander batalla contra Thor. MIENTRAS jim Bartomeu Ryan libera a Fenrir que Condena a SONY al RAGNAROK. Entonces Surt quemara la empresa y se apagaran las consolas.
This better be on the ps4 😂
Words cant explain how hype  i am for this game
Hahaa amazing
"GOW4: Atreus couldn't possibly be more cocky" "GOW5: Hold my beer"
pls be in ps 4
I personally don't like atreus's new look
Will this be playable on PS4? 🥺
CRINGE
Bueno el juego estará bien pero para ya Kratos es un chiste nomás ya todo lo fregó desde que se entro a FORNITE  Y es el hasme reír que no se acuerda de lo que ISO a Kratos
I don't mind Thor being fat tbh... In those time's (Aswell as the beliefs) it's not only almost accurate but also that was the aim as vikings, to be big and strong from war and gain a big belly from the victorious feasts.  Also people need to realise Thor isn't just a Marvel superhero 🤣
Angrboda is Isis.
They should add kratos in the next mortal kombat game
LOOOOOOOOOL
Kleitin o bom de guerra, terá um novo desafio.
it's just epic
Only for PS5 ?
Tyr: *stands up* Tyr: *realizes that it is Kratos the ghost of Sparta* Tyr: *seats down again*
The Fimblewinter...
Спасибо за длс за фул прайс
who the f disliked this video?
Can't wait to see Athena
Wow this was AMAZING it cannot be better😍
Ну вот ну нахера вы под конец испортили трейлер и саму игру естественно Это консольщики, у них даже выбора не будет поставить какой ни будь мод чтоб заменить чёрную бабу нормальной белой женщиной
Cory has done it again. New characters, new battle skills etc.. Who's excited as I am to get this epic franchise running on the PS5?🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Hey Johnny, look, this game doesn’t have any blac…never mind.
🔥Game of The Year 2022🔥
You need to watch the game at 60 fps, the smoothness of the picture is not enough!
everyone talking about Thor's comment. Meanwhile im crying over Kratos moving his arm towards his son to protect
Jeez Thor is ugly asf and disgusting looking 🤢 But down the doughnut before you get diabetes Thor. And it looks like he needs a shower.
After this game my PS4 will surely RIP! Fabulous work as always by Santa Monica.
I don’t really want to upgrade to PS5. But it’s really tempting.
HaHa 5.2k Xbox fanboys🤪
"Has anyone seen an englishman called Gavin?  Gavin?  Where are you"
AMAZING
Take my money 💸💸💰
😍😍😍💪
Looks like you can wield both weapons at once
کوردی تیایە 😂
Can't wait
And i'll never get to play it as every new playstation system is being and will be scalped.
Before anyone freaks out yes this does look amazing but this demo was mostly cutscenes and these demos usually get graphically downgraded for release to get a consistent frame rate and if sony wants to get that 4k 60fps that they have been banging on about they will definitely have to slightly nerf them.
0/10 not enough BOY
to doido pra jogar, pelo youtube, logico. :(
thor be like : lets do get help
This thor is real thor for mythology. Not marvel's thor
Definitely buying this and I'm patient enough to wait for it
Atreus carrying the deer with the antlers foreshadowing the Loki helmet
Odin will kill kratos and atreas will take revenge
BOY !
3:01 HER!!
WOW!!!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
In this game kratos should show his full potential
Hope  christian mythology is next <3 i wanna slay angels
0:20 Who else noticed that Atreus wears horns when he brings a deer to his father? A definite reference to Loki's horns
Hóng Dẽo chơi lắm
Spettacolo!
2:25 вроде как один из детей Локи
D: Why "Ragnarok" its written backwar... Oh, ok just from Jörmungandr perspective...
I would like to play this game, if I have a PS5 anyway... will it be available in PS4 by any chance? For sure PS5 will be still hard to find once this is out.
This game is so bad I hate it
Soy yo o me esperaba el trailer mas epico
Just as I thought kratos and Freya are fighting
Ааааа
Mantap baet!
Thor*
I can see no great improvements or new things. Hope in something better Than the last that was a great game.
Black Angbroda.... Ohh
im too broke to buy this ps5 man,unlucky
Soooooo nice
Wooooooooooow
"No!"  I felt that.
واو متحمس واااجد للجزء 😱
I m shocked 😱😱😱 and waiting for the moment ❤️❤️❤️
كوردی لێیە
Little bit disappointed to Places's lavel kind of same as GOW 4 i thought everything will be change 😓😓
اني
Game of the year
Loki's headgear reference 🔥
A toast for Kratos: The hands of Death could not defeat him, the Sisters of Fate could not control him, but NPCs and soyboys came and ruined the game forever
I almost forgot to watch this again
Seems like more of a dlc then a new game
Zeus ???
I just realised the antlers of the animal in the beginning are made to look like Loki's helmet.
Wow🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Que trailer maravilhoso !!! Eita Sony assim nois não guenta ksksks partiu ps5👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽😍
Can We  play on ps4??
When Tyr towers over kratos I remembered Hercules doing the same thing and that did not go well
Please relase on ps 4
This is going to be insane
After i saw tyr in loki side, Maybe fenrir will be in aesir side, yeah it will be tough, but kratos is in loki side, so no matter what odin do its fvkn useless.
I wonder if we'll get the blade of Olympus in this game.
Excited is an understatement
It's Peter Parkers voice
So basically, the parents are here for revenge.
я люблю эту игру все душой
When Kratos is the reasonable one.
This is going to be awesome 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Me: " i'm SO pre-ordering THIS!"  Kratos: "keep your expectations low boy... and you won't be dissapointed".
Круто!
Waiting 😍
Tenchu please
Mhhh black Angrboda from normans myphology.
They changed the boys voice
If any one need then contact me
'In moments of crisis, panic does nothing harness it, let it serve you'     - kratos
¿Una negra? Pfffff
Just imagine Mjolnir being picked up by Kratos much to Thor's awe and fear that Mjolnir finds Kratos more worthy than Thor to wield it.
Sooo... maybe by Christmas 2022 some of us will be able to actually buy a PS5
Realese ?
2.53 to 2.57 is the goosebumps moments of the trailer 🔥🔥
I can't play it
Thoooooooor
в конце показали черную девочку, так, для галочки
6/10
Graphics look same as the previous one
diversity at it again haahahahhahahaha
WOWOWOW that last kid, Egyptian (?) or Arabic(?) bc of the crocodile and... I have so many questions
This game will be interesting to play, for those of us that has PS4, we can only hope
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: I am, but aphrodite's bed thought otherwise
will it be on ps4 ?
А че на ps4 будет она или нет 😭😭😭😭
DISLIKED BY XBOX OWNERS😂
Sorry but this just looks like a dlc from the last one
Looks IMPECCABLE!😃👍 So this is the last game in the Norse saga. What’s gonna be in the next game after this one?
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general! *Kratos says "no" calmly.*
Same boring trash
will this game released on ps4?
who is Tyr?
Last time Kratos acted like a general, he _literally_ destroyed the world. Let's not, Atreus.
If it ain’t broke don’t fix it… they have done well
Lah belum dewasa si Atreus
I just need this SSD Update so I can play these wonderful games don't have space for all this......HELP ME PLZ !!!
black Vikings matter!!!!!!)))))))))))) I go for Lavrov!!!  by the way... If smbd make from black man the whiite man..... all trash begin to cry that this is impossible....
That kratos's voice ...
PS4  gang where u atttttt !!!!!!!
No interested anymore...
It's a guy from fornite,how they can steal someone thing.
Даже сюда повестку впихнули...опять негры
I hope the boy hears how Kratos was back then or gets to see the past
Esto fue orgásmico.
New magic, new weapons, characters like Ratatoskr, Verdfolnir, Nidhogg, Sif, Idunn, Frey, Fenrir, Hel, Surtr, Njordr, Bragi, Heimdall,    this is what I hope to see in the next game.
" Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!" No!
lets wait 10 years now😌
Meh
caraaaalhoooooooooooooou, só eu que nao tenho ps4 nem o ps5 e quer ver alguem jogar por estar doido de emoção? R.i.p preços no brasil
Estoy ansioso por tenerlo ya🙏❤
Nota 1000 muito hypado pra esse game 👍😁👏
Excited to play this, are they still in the asgard realem?
That girl at the end is Fenir and jorminganders mom in Norse mythology
1:50  Ok 🙂 Kratos said that
Espero que este en 4k y 60 fps en ps5 😒
muito daora
The Boy is talking too much, hope GoW doesnt become some teenage drama.
Great, they just had to throw in a token to ruin the immersion and make us think about the wokeists that currently plague this world 🤦‍♂️
Just let me buy an ps5
Hola
What I’ll be sad about the game is that I’ll have to upgrade the axe and the blades all over again :(
Atreus is too annoying honestly speaking he can't even stand kratos's one kick 😹
3:04 N moment
So excited for this, can't wait to see the gameplay!!
Лукашенко с сыном Колей
I love this game !
Akatsuki music?
The boy hit puberty so hard that he went from atreus to AT+HEAR+Us
no way thats real
What a level 😍🤩🔥💎
Black Angrboda,please stop,no!
Thor :You seem like a calm and responsible person Kratos be like boy u have no idea what im cable of.
Quien sera la niña
Is it playable in ps4?
if it came on pc like days gone it will be a hit
If this ain't 10/10. I don't know what is
Let's beg Sony for releasing on ps4
Never heard of it
I wonder if Kratos is the reason behind the Roman gods. All the Greek gods are in witsec and changed their names.
I smell wokeness already devouring  this game, even before it's out!......
Too much blah blah blah
5000Microsoft player disliked this video
Kratos saying "War is not the only way." hits different. Him of all people...  Edit: A heckin typo.
And when will they meet angerboda ?
why is there a black person in Norse mythology?
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIIIIIS 🥺🤩🤩
men, me toca prostituime para comprar la play 5 y ademas vender el play 4
Atreus ficou feio kkkk
I need this!!!
1:35 Game bug=))
Estaría cagado que al final de este juego Kratos vuelva a su hogar se de cuenta de que su gran rival Ares revivió ahora con la forma de Marte que acaba de construir el imperio Romano y de ahí revivir a todos los dioses (Zeus=Júpiter, etcétera) no lo sé, podría funcionar.
So am I the only one who had to change there pants a couple times seeing this trailer
A collectors edition featuring both games cut seamlessly together would be cool
Cleiton virado na desgraça
🔥🔥
What's yall opinion when the game will drop will it drop before the end of this year?
You know you're thinking of atreus as a kid but he's much older than you so yeah he an adult for this world at least.
2:31  new shield?
- I don't want to fight anyone. I just want answers! - You want answers? - I want the truth! - You can't handle the truth!
Already +5 million views? That was impressive.
I can't wait. Most anticipated game aside from Spider-Man 2 🙌
malditos, no sale para ps4, malditos sean
Is She Calliope?
It would be awesome if they gave kratos braids on his beard to give him that Norse Viking warrior transformation. Can’t wait to play this it will be a master piece!
Thor: are you calm and reasonable person  3 seconds later: Spartan rage available
Didn't know African people had immigrated to ancient Norway.
Finally the wait is over 😎🔥🔥
the hype is real
It'd be pretty sick if they somehow found a way to incorporate combos while wielding BOTH the axe and Blades of Chaos, or maybe even finishers. I know there's been some youtubers who've "broken" GoW and managed to pull some of those off.  Imagine the possibilities.
Una gran entrega.
El mejor juego.
No release year?
My dad's credit card's in danger
Everyone is talking about Thor's jab at Kratos, but no one's going to talk about the chilling orchestrated intro when Atreus walks into the cave? Because that got me.
Woow lo volvieron hacer, siempre innovando, obtendre el juego muy pronto..
Incrível!!
Pretty great that this trailer shows a bunch of gameplay.
frya:*attacks* kratos: YEET.
The final boss will be NoobMaster69
Ok, so either Kratos still hasn't told Atreus everything... Or he has and Atreus is being daft
Who's the blasian
Solo va a se para ps5 o tambien para el PS4?
اكو عرب؟
Also available on PC.
odin should be mexican
Didn’t know there was black people in Scandinavia
Paren de hacer secuelas del mismo juego!! Van a terminar destruyendolo
I think my PS4 slim can't handle this game it's hard to run in 20fps
I remember all those diverse people of color in all the years of studying norse mythology and history
От куда негры в скандинавии?
5 thousand mad XBOX fans.
This is gonna be epic
PS5…. Oh it exists? I never seen it in person. 🤦🏾‍♂️ I want one
Loki walking with a deer on his shoulders was actually intencional, if you know you know...
Eu vou comprar
I've seen this trailer too many times
Thumbs down
They should have a button to slap the boy. Sometimes he becomes so annoying.
Dont cry Rockstar Dont cry...
That's unfortunate Atreus's voice actor changed.
Don’t tell Atreus will get Bran Stark’s syndrome…
Boy has finally grown up
who was that girl at tje end
انتضررره على نار خررب هبل شوووكت ينزلللللللللللللللل 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤤🤤
Play station really just said at the end diversity
😲
Atreus: Tyr!   Sigurd: Eivor?
Thor gordinho do bololo
hi playstation is the system for ps4 glitching? because i cant acces cod so i uninstalled it, i tried to download it in the ps store but its just saying error including some parts like, voice party, chat, spotify, ps plus, those stuff are having errors, my parents will buy me the ps5 i guess.
RELEASE DATE ???
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Kratos:  boy
act like General? oh boy...  *GOW 1 and 2 series flashback.
Like kratos doughter kinayabi
is it coming for ps4
Make kiniabi ragnorak an actual person
So apparently Freya got her warrior's spirit back
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✌️
vamossss!!
So... Gods also got puberty?
Tyr trying to intimidate Kratos and Kratos is like "Oh here we go again... Is this a gods' thing?"
3:04 why is there a monkey 🦍🦍 in Norse mythology? They had to ruin this game with their "diversity
Se é loko vai ser monstro demais!
GOTY again
let be honest here we all want kratos to act like a general and not like a father we all want to decapitate thor and odin , helios style .conflict with gods is inevitable
is there also a PlayStation 4 version?
2:41 I think that's Khyber'S door.?
This game's gonna be 🔥🔥
Since they’ve revealed so many details/characters so far; this has to just be the tip of the iceberg. This game is gonna be huge
HYPE
Anyone.....What an honor to be the son of kratos ghost of sparta son of zeus
Is Sunny Suljic still Atreus?
i just can't get enough of this trailer
Hopefully kratos: oh boy here I go destroying another pantheon
Atreus lookin like ninja
Es la sKiN dE eL fOrNiTe :○
B O Y
So, who's that girl?
Does anyone know if it will be available for playstation 4 as well?
But the sister of Thor will be revealed in the next game?
Dad of War 2
Nobody is gonna talk about the girl in the end, Angrboda? She is the mother of Jormundander, Fenrir and Hela, and lover of Loki (insert teenager sitcom music).
Woooowwwww.... Who is that black person ??? Seriously?? In norse mythology 😂
يخي ماشي انا احب اللعبه بس لويش تحطولنا توقعات بمصر ومدري ايش والله الواحد كان متحمس
I heat falcary its so hard to finish it
IM BUYING RN!!!!!
"Imagine if Kratos never thinked like a General" - some aliven't bodies in Greece, probably
This gow seems similar to PS4 game, without update graphics...meeh !
I can’t wait to see what they added for the combat system!!
We want more!!!
Now if only I could get my hands on a PS5 🙃
حماس الف 😍❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥🇴🇲
Really hope they show more of the old Kratos...
*Kratos:* “Atreus are you ready?”  *Atreus:* _“Yeah but.. I had the weirdest dream. Fimbulwinter was ending. And Thor came for us, here at the house.”_  *Kratos:* _”It was only a dream.”_  *Atreus:* _”But it felt different. It felt real.. it felt like, the future._  *Kratos:* _”Then we will worry about it tomorrow. Today there are still things we can do. Come.”_
Темнокожая в скандинавии, окей толерашки
Freya seems to have gotten her fighting spirit back
Separate game?? More like a roided DLC.
Not Bad
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general.  Ooh, yeah.... I wouldn't...
Shout out and take my money
My hopes are high, Santa monica has a lot more time compared to the last game,  they are not building from scratch, fixing bugs and inventing new gameplay, this makes space for more epic stories.
Im just hoping that we get more brutal finisher animations
only for 5 not for 4?
Ps5 lol fix chips.. corona bla bla... Its a shame
FINALLY!!! Thank you
Вау,мурашки по коже
Looking same than Ps4 xd
Que bueno!!!
I was waiting for Hulk to come out
The hype level for this is off the charts!! I cant wait!! Looks Fantastic!! GOTY again!! <3!!!
It will be available on PS4? Please, say yes....
Kratos X Thor meu Deus! Que épico!
THOR: you seem like a CLAM and REASONABLE PERSON KRATOS:  remember magni and modi Or baldur ????
a black girl living in nordic world, ok, true....
Are they going to explain how he went to Norway?? .. he is Greek after all!!
this is not new game ,is new expansion on last game
I Just Can't wait for Mimir to tell me stories from the start and to the end
Thor : I have an army  Atreus : I have a kratos
Mais do mesmo
I cant wait to murder the whole Norse pantheon, thank you playstation 🙌🔥❄
Beautiful trailer😍❤
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?? Kratos: L3+R3
Te quiero mucho play station
Who is tyr? and who is this girl ?
WOW
Hope i can see Atreus's new moves chaining combo with Kratos or even play as him.
00:27 That man said, “in the direction of deer.”
Why Angrboda is black?
I was really hoping the camera was a bit more zoomed out.  Like a Dark souls or Bloodborne amount of zoom so I can see more of the area that isn't Kratos' head. :|
PS4 Grafik🤣
Z
These type of game series must be had different names that is the respect for their past and legacy..
Is that calliope in the end
Black women?!?! 😂
Date de sortite ?
Tyr has 2 hands😳
🔥
🔥🙏🏻
Play station has no competence.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
قود اوف وار راغنروك متحمس
Love the trailer! This game is going to be a masterpiece!
احححححححح
love this trailer. GOATed
😱💥
Blаck girl, Scandinavia, really??
I love Atrues riding on his summoned animal!!! That is EPIC!
Wait is the ending jingle that of the avengers?
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing...wow.
Не знал, что негры жили в Скандинавии
i don't like it
How much will this DLC cost?
Ps4 ? 🙂💔
So exited cannot wait to play, so sad I only saw it 2 days later
Все нормуль... только от нетфликса заразились цветной революцией в конце....  надоело уже....
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general for once!"  The entire Greek pantheon: "Yeah, you don't want that..."
The music at 2:52 it’s just, wow it gives me chills man
That siluette of Atreus in the beginning with deer's horns. Nice one game, nice one!
woooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
In starting video you can see how horns of Loki
i can see the voice actor changed
Sure hope to see more combat gameplay, hope we dont stay stuck to the floor again.
Ótimo mais um jogo que eu não irei jogar
Kratos looks up at someone, reminds me of the Hercules battle.
Wait Why there is a black girl in middle of a very white region in that time? Why?😂
I feel like they're rushing the game..
0:54
Looks more like a dlc than a new Game
And this is why I still buy play stations
well everybody react about : boi : "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" and saying that he is realy dumb (that's true btw) but just think about it : in the precedent game atreus wanted kratos to be more like a father and now it's the opposite our baby boi realy changed T_T
Yeah.. I'm here.
Tyr should be in the NBA
Freya: Flying.    Kratos: So you have chosen death.
Atreus: “Stop thinking like a father and think like a general” Everyone: my dear BOI, you do not know what you’re asking for
No one is asking who the girl at the end is?
It would be great if I could get a ps5...
I wish there was a love button besides like button.
2:48 the best ever
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: So you have chosen... death.
Nunca voy a entender como es que kratos le tiene tanta paciencia a atreus
2:25 there’s a centaur.  Think we’re going back to Kratos’ old world for something?  I wonder if we’ll get the stomach rip kill animation from GOW III
i cant believe that this is the end for the norse saga, i am so unbelievably hyped, even if i wont be able to afford/buy it myself!
the goosebumps I get from watching this...
Kratos should call boy son instead in this part
Boy dont ask him to be a general, you dont wanna see that
Wow it's impressive 😆😁
tileyspeysıon :D
Honestly this is the best video game you will ever play
Fantastic!
Tyr having two hands Fenrir:and i took that personally
Por fin tanto esperar 😍😍😍😍😍
I suffer from chronic depression, it's rare for me to feel but I loved the remake so much I can't wait to play this!
Еба он вырос
If I get 1 dollar every time I watch this I would be a millionaire :')
Is it going to be on PS4 too or just on PS5 ? 🤔🤔
I don’t like the smirk the girl gives at the end. Looks like the toxic smile of a girl I used to hang around
July 2023 release date betting now. Anyone wanna join in?
Ohhh i can waitt
The Game Looks Sick ( As in Great!), I just Hope this doesn't mean SSM is going stupidly "Woke"! 🙄
It seems like their will be another part of this game in future  They have just found tyr  But they still have to fight thor and more importantly Odin himself  And the last part of this trailer is strategically placed in there "You'll get your answers soon enough, well some of them" This is going to be a very long franchise I guess I'm Excited....
Wait, if we have to fight Freya, does that mean we might have to fight giant tree turtle... :|
Man do I know that boy
Of course they had to put some woke elements in it.. other than that it looked great
PS5 sales 📈📈📈
All right now we need a team of "Gods of War" of different religions just like The Avengers.
Gotta love Christopher Judge's voice. A truly badass Kratos
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Is that a button prompt above your head?
3:05 I don’t know who you are but I’m in love with you
Tyr: towers over Kratos. Kratos: thought you'd be bigger. But you're definitely the one.
نه خدای کریتوس داشت تریاک میکشید؟ چیکار میکرد 😂 اخه. کارگردان  تریلرو زنده میخام😂😂
And new gold yaer for gamers
Looks great but I was hoping for it to be a bit different. It's just an expansion pack at this point. It looks exactly the same.
Гта 5 сосатб
Hype asf
Late 2022
Atreus is no longer a boah
And xbox user are crying again...
I can't wait to play it at the end of ps5 generation after you add it to plus collection
I don't why but I keep watching this... It's something...
Is this your 20th time watching this trailer? "Yes" Don't you think that's enough? "1:57"
Date ??
Could be GOTY 2022 😁😁😁
Irado!!!😘😘😘👏👏👏👏
I hope they don't make Atreus g4y
Me: Boi your voice has change Also me: is this moster hunter (that different moster they fight in the trailer)🤣
Please release it on pc 🙏🙏
Will it come out for Ps4 too? Saldra para PS4 Tambien alguien sabe??

THOR : are you a calm and reasonable  person ? KRATOS: ask your counterpart from greek mythology.
Just in ps5 🥺🥺🥺

This is going to be Mount Olympus all over again..
Everything's op but what at 1:33  "What the dog doin"
santa monica have a lot of explaining to do on why the blades of chaos look rusted again and kratos’ armour looks watered down
XBOX EN PLS
Bastante flojito
Video starts with Atreus bringing a deer. Showing his growth. Nice.
im guessing 0:12 this is the start of the game
Give us release date please
Yet another company that spits in the face of European history. All part of the campaign to rewrite history.
It would be dope if they would add Gods from egyptian mythology later on 🔥
YESSS
... read it, BOI.
Disappointing....looks like an dlc and not a new part ...same gameplay...same graphics 😔
Loki's wife is black nothing is safe.
Who is that girl in the end
I'm I the only one notice tyr look  like Zeus in Gow 3???
So exciter for this one!!!!
Nice
Oo yeah
Ps4 ...?! Hello....??! Anybody home
Kratos needs to be the face of Play Station.
رووووووووعة عادة بقوة كبيرة وحماس
This game itself is a tsunami for the whole XBOX world and it will definitely blow it away.
💎⭐ *ESTOY COMPLETAMENTE SEGURO QUE LA PERSONA QUE SE DETUVO A LEER ESTO SERÁ EXITOSA EN TODO LO QUE HAGA* ⭐💎
It’s times like this that I wish we had time machines
What’s the release date on this?
Hype
🎉👍🎉
Please release it for ps4 too
This is nice.
Does atreus have a new voice actor or he's just older?
اصطوري
Tyr join Kratos Thor to Odin : "This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"
I hope this game when it comes out guys!!!
Santa Monica studios does it again
Uncle MIMIR!!!!
GG GAMING
Increíble
This game looks so beautiful I cried manly tears 😭
**Tyr towers over kratos** Kratos : I think you are smaller than dragons i have defeated. **Tyr towers down**
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY!!
yes
This game looks beautiful cannot wait for this
waiting for long for this..... thor.....
When Kratose and Boi are in the realm of the dwarfs are the monsters also small?
WHattt!! GOW: Ragnarok!1 HOLY SHI""""""!!!

Thor and loki from marvel
Anne soda var mı ?

Please release the game soon ❤️❤️❤️❤️
oh man. i shouldn't have watched trailers. they reveal too much. dammit
Yes YES YEESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
*THEY EVEN DO THE TRAILERS RIGHT!*
does anyone think that thor kinda sounds like josh brolin? i know the voice actor is a completely different person and im not complaining
Ooh that's Angrboda near the end iirc. For those who don't know, that's Loki's wife who serves him until Ragnarok because he's bound to a rock with a snake above his head. The venom from the snake shall drip on Loki's forehead until Ragnarok. Angrboda tries to alleviate his pain by collecting the poison in a cup
I know this game will win the game of the year 12/9/2021
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person  The entire Greek Pantheon: trust us bro he ain’t
I still can't imagine Atreus getting humped by a horse
So PS5 will be just… higher res, ray-tracing, haptic-enabled?? Anything else?
Why does the Axe look like it reverted to lvl 1 again? Where are the gold and upgrades by the brothers?
im pretty sure Kratos is going to explode in this game and bring someone with him
3:04 oh cool it’s that girl from the polar express
Eu quero esse jogo de graça
2:53 hard not to climax everytime
Hype is real...
Love how’s she’s like “you’ll get all the answers soon enough, well some of them”  Hence no release date lol
It’s game over Xbox
Well, time to buy a PS5 .
This is gonna be awesome !
Dad of gore ragnarok the game
I love how doc McStuffins is in gow
gracias
game of the year 2022! SURE!!!!
Как в это вы будите играть на пк
Bro anyone notice at 0:25 Atreus is hunting without help, but then also Kratos is making arrows for his boy. How far has this father figure come since the last one
When is it coming outttttt
what dreary clap trap brain rott are people wasting away on
Scandinavia = white gods.  Who are you , pretty sunshine in the end ?!
oh lord. pubescent atreus
graphics just same with ps4
Love watching the Trailer for an insane Game i cant even buy the Console for to play it one Day because it wont be still available by the time the Sequel is here.
VisLaud
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Do you know Helios and Hermes?
Angrboda. Now things seem interesting.
يسعد دينكو واخيرا
Projectiles and other attacks should not go through other enemies at all, a player should be able to line up enemies and use them as a shield. Not like its predecessor of this game where all projectiles and other attacks go through enemies hitting you in the face when they shouldn't have.
Yoooo whens thor coming 💀
2:50 John wick? 😅
Does anyone see what I see? Hmmm? What change in technicolor!
Trasch
Ale luja w końcu wyszło
Fat thor 😐 may be 💠 inspired from end game 🤣
the boys got a wife boy
AC Valhalla Stories
Looks like movie trailer
The legend is return
Mimir should really tell Thor that the last thing he wants is for Kratos to be mad otherwise Ragnarok might come a little too early.
This is my 10th time watching
I only wish I could play it on PS4, since I'm not going to buy a PS5 for some time 😢
GAME OF THE YEAR
maybe thor is talking to atreus, not kratos
why are people mad about angraboda being black can anyone explain
WOW to bad I can't get a ps5 for less than 1100$ :((((
Why isn't thor asian? My culture isn't respected in this game
Kratos: _(enters Atreus’ room)_ Atreus: _(Naked and mounting a horse)_ *“FATHER!* It’s not what it looks like!” Kratos: _(gets belt of obedience)_ “I told you to leave that *HORSE* alone, boy...”
So atreus got a girl now?
Did the voice actor for kratos change?
You guys just couldnt hold back with your diversity agenda huh?
Mom can i buy PS5 ? Mom : 2:50
Судя по трейлеру ни чем не отличается от прошлой части
I feel something missing!  " BOIIIII "
This better not had been the best parts of the game. But I’m very excited
One word Crossgen.....
Woooooooooooo This Is So Masterpiece Uuu
Was going to ask why this still looks like a PS4 pro game and then realized it's still coming out for PS4... Another case of old hardware holding back progress... Same thing with the new Horizon game. Smh... Thanks China for imploding the world economy and limiting new hardware production. All part of the plan though right?
Cadê os br????
Its going  down
I'm gone just joke with thor since  he thinks lightning  stop da ghost of sparta
I can't wait for it
I MISS THOSE HUGE BOSSES........
Shut up and take my money!!!
At the end of the video we see a girl, is she his doughter, it looks like indian or japanese look,will Kratos go there?
Try looks amazing
So hyped for this
Will it is going to be released on PS4?
Thor : Are u a calm and reasonable person. Kratos : Wait, I think i need that hammer.
They never disappoint us.. never ever
Can't wait to pirate this game and play for free😍
What happened to jormungandr ?
are you coming with us ........ the character look like Zeus............ may be the Zeus will help kratos ......the family bond will reunion......😜😜😜😜...... this will not happen.......
Kratos old voice was awesome
Ps4 graphic :0
They kept mamir's head 😂😂
Black girl in norse mythology.. lol
BIG W
An African American in Norse mythology? It's GREAT!!  All hail political correctness!!
I think Cory Barlog's wife's boyfriend will like this game!
Reveal thor please
They don't revel Thor ..
PS4 plis
honestly,this not just a GOTY contender,it's a GOAT game
Google razorwraith 😈🤘🏾👻🌹🌋🙅👹☠️
I love the Norse lore so much
Is this coming to ps4
Game of the century
The last time he though like a general, he regreted it deeply.
Meh, pass
CONTENT NOT AVAILABLE
I hope Mimir is more expressive in this game. I’d like to get a nasty combo and have his jaw drop or something 😂
Ps4?
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and  start thinking like general" BOY you have no idea
Game of the year 2022
Just replayed the last GOW on the PS5 runs absolutely brilliantly
what's up with current yen?
Why do they have to design women to be ugly?
I want to see blade of olympus ! In this game once again • ×
can we play this on ps4 too?
Thor : “You seem like a calm and reasonable person”. Kratos: “Yes, lemme just show you the Spartan calmness and my blades of harmony”.
I just hope kratos can finally wear boots.
chills
2:51 remind me kratos vs hercules
Got to get the token in.
لعنتی زود تر بیا
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really want this game in ps4😭😭
3:00 release date? 🤔
This is going to be lit
GOTY 2022
Daaaaaymn............
Dude I'm so hyped
OMFG I CANNOT WAIT! I've been ready for this since the credits rolled on GoW 2018!
op
Ah, the famous black people of norse mithology!
BTW that person's head is still on his belt thing
What’s her @
I loved that trailer. Not spoiling it for myself with walkthroughs this time.
Now I  will get this agame
why black girl
HERMOSO
Thor is indeed a *sussy baka*
i like it
That Loki with Antler entrance. Foreshadowing Loki's famous helmet.
NO!!!
Like a movie
He will be in PS4 or only in ps5
What does mimir say? A what expression?
Another case of Redheads being replaced by Black women
I literally ripped off my shirt when they shown the trailer during the PlayStation showcase, I was that excited. Can't wait until it comes out 🤘
I can't wait to be realized 🤩
Stop being obsessed with release date bro. This is exactly what's wrong with players, always demanding to be quicker to make video games. Our expectations are killing the industry. The video game industry is suffering, with crunches like for Rockstar games or for Cyber Punk. Let people breath and work peacefully, we're not in a hurry. These kind of games deserve time to be this amazing.
Angrboda isn't black, she's part of Norse mythology. It's clearly motivated by DE&I quotas. Like do a game in Africa with African mythology, but it's so forced when you do this.
i came
I don't know what to comment but I'll just comment
there's a centaur. we saw how kratos kill those things in gow 3. hope this one will be gruesome too
sunny really hit puberty
Playstation can I have a free ps5? Pls I’m broke😭😭
BOY!
This is better than Spiderman.
Boy
Angrboda is black...... Hail to Norsca!
Angrboða. She couldn't be black. The Scandinavians could not see them, and if they did, it was only as slaves. The screenwriter is weak in mythology, a dropout. Screenwriter under the agenda. Ugly fact...
Disliked, sorry. They had 4 years to make a next-gen game rather than a 70$ DLC. Especially given that this is an exclusive title and that PS5 is almost 1year old.
Beautiful, the legacy continues
YEAH BOiiiii....!!!!
Those who are PS4 users... You want to play the whole game on YouTube.
Please tell me The little black girl is a Egyptian Traveler for the Next saga to Egypt Mythology(My country) and not some "minority quota".
❤️
I think gow still has the best graphics of all ps games
Just seems like more of the same.
Amazing i am waiting for the game yes and thanks a lot to playstation for entertainment we
BOOOOIIIIIIIIII
Класс :-******
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Сделал реакцию на трейлер,кому интересно чекайте
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
best game forever
MT foda
tyr makes kratos look like a boi
Thor vs kratos ❤️
NO WAYY!! NOTHING CAN BEAT MY HYPE FOR THIS!
I want greek mytology back
Did Freya destroyed Kratos shield like thanos destroyed captain Am??
The wait is finally over... Kratus is back again
Окей, все бомбят из-за того, что Тор не стройный красавчик, а то что у них негра в скандинавии всех устраивает???
I hope they will release this game when the semiconductors crisis it will be almost over.
LoL! Notice the placement of the horns when Atreus comes in the cave.
I can't stop watching this trailer. This is awesome i swear...
2:51 5'11 vs 6ft
A bit disappointed that the norse saga will be concluded with this title. I was really hoping to fight Odin and whoever there is left. And I feel like there's more to tell about Atreus and his mother.
Why is no one mentioning the "...think like a general" part?
Another black washing!
This is absolutely the best moment of the gaming history.
Why Angrboda is black, and with the dreads? She is jötunn, she can't have it. Are you racist?
If this isn't the greatest video game trailer ever made I don't know what is.
i cant wait for the fatherly advice i could get in this game. the last one was pretty amazing
Someone bout to be father in law
Well im waiting to see Jörmungandr fight with thor that will be amazing and i want to know if he will send him back in future or kratos helps him and they kill thor.
BRUH WHAT ABOUT THE BOSSES BRUH THAT AINT RAGNAROK THERE ISNT ANY BOSS AND I DONT SEE ANY WAR WHAT
Tyr: has both hands  Fenrir: You know the rules, and so do I.
I think it's funny that BOY's voice is changing because he's getting older.
i will be disapointed if we cant pet wolfs.
Ееееееееееее!
the 2 wolves pulling the sled are black and white just like the wolves in Norse mythology named Skoll and Hati, its said that they chase the sun and moon gods Sol and Mani. At ragnorok they will catch their prey and devour the sun and moon.
I know it's the current year. But does every video-game and movie has to have a black character in it? I know Kratos' voice actor is a black man. It's like the equivalent of a Japanese or Korean drama/game to have white people in it during middle ages.
i hope this comes to PC
I thought tyr looked different but he is ok
Boose boms
Are you going to download a copy on ps4?
01:50  Kratos:- War is not the only way Kratos change a lot........
01:50  Kratos:- War is not the only way Kratos change a lot........

I hope they release this on PS4....
Sol ps5
Are you a calm and reasonable person?  *Greece has left the chat*
I will be number 1 to pre order this
Finally 😧
Very nice
FINALLY!!
😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
If i don't hear a 'boy' in this trailer i will throw something  Edit: well i now have a broken Funko pop so there's that
Masterpiece
Is it gonna be on ps4
i hate this outro of playstation ha tfuu
Wait, Kratos isnt Black?
What a lovely father and son game...👍
Hey Sony when I’ll be able to buy PlayStation 5 ?
Dawajcie tę grę i bierzcie moje pieniądze... 😍
Make it for ps4 to
интерактивная сказка, нарисовано красиво
Oh yeaaah so hyped for this gonna buy this as soon it comes out
Not gonna cap atreus looks like the back pack kid
I already see this meme where tall woman holds the short one...
Tyr better enjoy those hands while he can.
Please change Atreus’s hair it looks horrible
Missing the sound boyy.....
Can’t wait for Jacksepticeye to make a full playthrough
Cant wait to discover Asgard,Svaltarheim and Vanaheim
Who wanted Tyr to say "YES!!!"
GO MAN KILL THOR KILL ODIN KILL LOKI KILLL THEMMM ALLLLLLLLL YEAHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Looks like dlc to be honest, but looks great
going woke?
I am a little disappointed their is nothing special .
Dwarf Thor needs another beer
0:44 look like atreus wants to find out his "GLORIOUS PURPOSE"
The standard enemy types look to all be different colour varients of the same model again, graphically the game looks like dlc for the original.. Sony doing ps5 owners dirty as usual.
Of course, a black woman in Norse land and mythology....😒
xbox thought they had the best exclusives this year until song released this trailer
I can't wait. But i have not ps5😂😂
You can get in on a few of the personal data you have for a 7 of your own
*BE AWARE ALL THE GAME CREATORS OUT THERE, GAME O' THE YEAR 2022 IS COMING"🔥
It's official....Santa Monica games only make masterpieces.

So... Freya will be a bad guy after all.

This is BANGIS!!!!
BOY!
only issue i have is again i wish there was an option to pull the camera back so i can actually see what i'm fighting and still no jump button or Air Combos. even though i enjoyed the past game for what it was this still does not hold up to those PS2 games in terms of combat.
Что-то новое кроме локаций завезут?
Who is ANGRBODA?
357K fanboys sucking kratos’s….boi   Season 8 of game of thrones has better writing than this garbage   FAnbOiS incoming 🙄
it's also for PS4 check for Twitter
It took too long
Bro we’re the advengers man thor was there were is hulk
Best thing they did they brought blade with chains back
Looks like a DLC at the price of the full game...
Se puede de Play 4
Tyr stands up.  Kratos: “You’re big……. fought bigger.”
I want the movie. I want the movie. Sony stop stalling and just give us a date for The GOW movie. Will Gerrard Butler be the main Protagonist?
Our boy has grown :")
Why does kratos voice sounds like vin diesel's in this new game?.. i like it not gonna lie..😏 lol
Now that im thinking about it, Atreus is probably going to be the final boss of the series.
Is that the same voice actor for Atreus?
Sony should make a movie about GOW
Tyr towering over Kratos  Kratos: you grew up little brother
Xbox can stop de production of its machines now…
Those 9/11 vibes tho...
🔥🙌🏼💯 🎮
I want Kratos to finally know how to read Nordic language
tyr standing up in front of kratos gives me hercules vibes...
Atreus: stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general Kratos: ok boi here is your popcorn 🍿 sit back relax and watch me repeat gow 3 in Norse pantheon
Ууууу
It looks like another 10/10 GOTY.
When does this release?
Do y'all think Atreus will still hop on Kratos back when they climb?
Imagine if Tyr and Kratos teamed up to kill Odin and Thor. What a battle that would be holy moly.
But is it coming out on ps4 because it's almost impossible to get a ps5 and twice the price in my country
Dont know if anyone else's noticed this but when kratos. Asked tyr to come with him he had is hands on both of tyr's shoulder which means that he was reassuring him form something and he understands and got ready to go with them which the developers portrayed as he and kratos are gonna fight
>afronordic I see.
Can we play this game on PS4?...plz answer..
Sony: Stop buying PS4 games for $60 and start buying PS5 games for $70.  Me: NO!!!
Ninja theory = cool
Ninja theory is cool
Tyr has two hands.  Fenrir: Now this looks like a job for me.
Well, guess I'm finally buying a PS5
One of the multiverse possibility Dr strange saw of Thor 😂
Can u take my money now? 1:57
This game is single-handedly the reason I will be buying a PS5.
4.6K people are not prepared☠️☠️☠️
"We will be the gods that we wish to be"
Manda pra ps4 Sony
Kratos is back
Since when nórdic mythology has african people
Worst game ever
Dislikers must be Xbox players lol😂
👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
C biene
YES! JUST YES!
The guy that was the conductor for the orchestra for the last GoW looks like Tyr.
Im just gonna wait for radbrad😂
This is the only reason i would stray from the path of xbox
These woke developers would rather make a game centered around norse mythology and then blackwash a character instead of just making a game centered around African mythology and history. Of course they don't do that because they would see it as too big of a risk to actually represent certain cultures.  And we are the racists for pointing this out apparently.
😍😍😍😍cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
This will easily be the greatest game of all time
Am I the only one that thinks Atreus sounds different maybe they got a different voice actor
When is this movie coming out?
Epic :o
💯🔥
1:37 I need that backsound
man this is a great prerendered target demo!! Hopefully they can live up to it when its running on actual hardware. When is the PS5 coming out anyway?
حماس مليوووون
They gone woke...race swapping again...
Noice
Ge
Fat thor lol
Another masterpiece 😌
And PS4?
Nao vou jogar mas vou assistir = ) HeHe
PS5 ONLY ?
BOYYYYY WE HAVE ANOTHER SEQUEL
I am beyond excited for this trailer just like everyone else but I really want to share something.  Everyone is talking about the way Kratos reacted to Atreus' comment about thinking like a general...  Wouldn't it be emotionally pulling if at some point in this game, we hear Calliope's tune from Chains of Olympus?  I know it probably won't, but that thought crossed my mind.
GAROTO
Sunny Suljic has grown up so much and it shows as Atreus. Which is so cool.
looking at this makes me feel sad I dont have a ps5 cuz its really hard to find
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Nunca pense que kratos tendria que mirar hacia arriva mientras esta hablando de frente con una persona
Looks like a fun game. Too bad there aren't any PlayStation 5's available on the planet to play it on.
Imagine playing as tyr
Ni uno en español nmms
Ну где мясо сделайте как в мстители убейте всех потом кратос что бы вернулся из ада что бы всё исправить отсылки к прошлой жизни что бы были
Atres went from: Boi to:       B       o       i like, fr, hes way taller now
Noticed that Tyr doesn’t have his arm tattoos when he goes to stand.
Where is Odin and JURMUNGANDR 🐍
Que pro xd
PS4 plisssssss
Something tells me this game is not going to be all that../ idk why I get the vibe
the egyptian gods finna be sweating when this game/chapter is done
Can’t wait
Boy .....
2:52 deja vu😂
2:35 atreus has learned so much runic summoning
The real question is, is Odin so greedy that, even having apparently broken his curse on Freya, he still held on to her wings?
Thor: "You seem like a calm and the reasonable person". The entire Olympian pantheon: "Boy, have you not been paying attention?"
Wait a minute how did he use lethan axe in helhium
Mano esse jogo vai ser épico e mó pica
I hope Kratos says boy
Nice dlc, no graphical improvement
Why is 30fps still a thing for games like this? 🤔
I'm waiting for an Xbox player commenting "Xbox better at specification"
Te amo
2:53 Kratos be like "Am I supposed to be intimated or something?"
Atreus is much bigger now
KRATOS
2020 when i got to buy a second had ps4 and a used GOW game finished it (not 100%) then this came out!!!! dang it!
Itll be nice if i can go to the store and buy a Playstation 5.... Yall making all of these games but how we suppose to play em without the system....
Will it be on ps4
Louco para jogar logo esse jogo!!!
I don’t preorder games but to support Santa Monica Studios and the greatness they’re delivering I’m going!
Boyy!!!!!
Imagine disliking this!
Failed to play it because it is only ps5
What I love most about this new trilogy is that Kratos has no interest in fighting anyone and just wants to live in peace with his son.
Is political correctness blackwashing?
My body is ready
yehaaaaaaaa
is it Zendaya at the end?
B O Y
Yyeeeeeeessss, finally!
SONY, I know you just want me buy PS5, You WIN, take my money
I'm totally not surprised to see a racist American corpo, race swapping Angrboða and trying to destroy Norse culture just to make a little money.
Garoto
Ñ
El momento a llegado
Yeah it’s confimed I gotta get a ps5
I hope they don’t make Atreus annoying and so defiant
This will interesting
Hope the team isn't too stressed out. This looks like even more work has gone in. Of course it looks epic. Best of luck for release 😬
Geez 2 days and 4.8m views
La niña es caliope la hija de kratos
great game, how do I get the console?
Top Top Top  Top Top Top

Halo better!
Angrboda???
Sou seu fã PlayStation
Oh my goodness, I love Angrboda. She's so cute!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Prepare yourself boy, winter draws near"
Atreus: Wait- Angrboða...you mean.. _we_ have children??  Norse Zendaya: **giggles** Another time in another place, Atreus. But- you _will_ have children before me.  Atreus: 👀   Norse Zendaya: Oðinn will shapechange you into The Grey Mare to bare the seed of the stallion, Svaðilfari. Your child will be Sleipnir, The Steed of Oðinn.  Atreus: _THE  WHAT!!_  Kratos: HAHA Bhoi!! You get creampied by a horse!!
:0
does anyone else realize the girl is probably Sigyn, Loki's wife.
Tyr: stands up  Titans: laugh in danger

WHERE IS MY WIFE'S SON, AGAIN?!
There weren't Buhlacks in Ancient Scandinavia. They have ruined the franchise solding it's soul to mainstream ideology
Anyone here notices all the reused assets or is it just me
I don't know about his new voice
Top
😍😍
Only in the PS5 ? There is no in PS4 ?
What happened to Kratos other weapons he got of the old ones?
Cliopy?
YESSSSSSSSS💀💀💀💀💀💀
In the 3rd game, I expect Kratos to call Atreus "young man", if he ever makes it to the late teens
The return of Kratos and Boy💪🔥🔥
para cuando en pc?
Ooooooooooo may gqaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Last time kratos thought like a general he just destroyed his entire family.
No one gonna talk about how Thor has stuby af fingers?
Eu vendo que se o atreus engravidar alguém nesse estado de jovem, ele não só vai apanhar, ele vai apanhar do Kratos que por azar dele é o deus da guerra, ent boa sorte atreus use sempre camisinha
I'm so excited for this game!
Sensacional!
Not a single "Boy!" was uttered.   4/10
VERY ULTRA NICE 👌👍😁
😘😘😘
I can't wait for this game
I've played every single game in this series....my all-time favorite.... I'm gonna be 48 years old by the time this game comes out. Sometimes I feel like I'm too old for VGs. But guess what? There goes my $60! 😌
Let me guess, no PS4 right? Guess I'll play it in a few years when PS5 isn't my whole pay check
💣🤩🤩

Bien ahora freya puede pelear y thir no estaba muerto se había ido de parranda
Welp, another reason for me to buy PS5 and a 4K TV. Unfortunately, my broke @$$ don't allow it.. For now..
Love how Atreus changed
Por esto no me he pasado a Xbox
That’s so dope that Tyr is in here
P
P
Was that supposed to be the spirit of Calliope? If so that would be sick
Hope the boss fights are a tad better this time around.
cade o sangue dessa po#@ , as sonetes piram nisso ai triste!
Mimir needs to tell Atreus that the last time his dad acted like a General, the whole Greece is in ruins. Literally.
Did she break the shield?
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  Kratos: Yesn't

1 razon solida para empezar a pensar si comprar el ps5 pues no soy rico
Lo busqué por curiosidad sin saber nada de noticias y resulta que lo subieron hace 18 horas cuando lo ví , súper emocionante
Só queria ter um PS5 pra poder jogar essa maravilha
Can I get a ohhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhh in the chat?!
in Kratos' voice Your body has grown, boy! But your mind....hasn't!
You can't hide yourself forever Spartan, no any more
Thor's hammer looks similar to the one in ac valhalla
IMAGINE FENRIR
Looks more like a DLC than a "sequel".
honestly my favourite game ever. I can't even get a PS5 because they are all out of stock. Anyone else the same?
"God's of war" is more appropriate.
yayyy poc characters
Yes, funally
I dont have a playstation But Im pretty confident Teal'c knows to not F* around with the Asgard
>Me muero!
Thanks for reminding me my financial status 🙃
This game is in a league of its own.

Wow, it's trending in Iraq
That's the HOTTEST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!
Disappointed I can only like this once.
Eita Agora o Atreus pode montar nos animais Que máximo
Aww token characters at the end
I don't know why i freaking hate Atreus voice ToT it's not suit him😵
this gives me goosebumps
2:20 Vanaheim
Very sad that the best series of games in history has turned into a propaganda of a new agenda.
Will it be on ps4?
Day 58 of being in every corner of YouTube
Есть хоть один русский комент?
Another masterpiece. 10/10
Everything was fine until the last frames with a true Norwegian.
Is it coming for the PS4 also
Haha, the leftists just cant help themselves. They have to push an African in somehow. Surprised that Thor isnt black 👎
are you sure this is not a dlc? it looks the same
Woooooooooo
fak and i need to buy that magical box to play this :(
This game has more of a brighter feel
Looks like dlc..
EU TE AMO CARECA
Love that we got Loki's mythological spouse, Angrboða, at the very end. That at least should make for some funny conversations during the upcoming game!
Quee?
Tyr stands up.. Lady Dimitrescu has entered the chat
Me yesterday: I don't need a console Me today: Maybe I need a console
In moments of crisis, panic does nothing... GOLDEN WORDS
Getting a feeling this will only be one the ps5 and not ps4
Words cannot describe how HYPED I am for this game. Especially after seeing this trailer
Outra bosta .kkkk
Could've sworn Thor was Thanos. I was waiting for an inevitable reference
I was literally screaming when I was watching this masterpiece
yo yo y o yo ama solo maka molo wowosodskgniohrj

Oh come on when's the release date 😭😭
Saldrá pa ps4?
I think that atreus is going to be a naughty boy in this GOW
Man I love how they got atreus he's taller than Barack now but kratos is still more bigger kratos and his son are about to go on the craziest adventures ever before beyond anything
Without gaia's narrative voice This game is not complete
I gotta stay alive until this comes out
Yeah cool... but how are we going to play it if we can't get the PS5 🙄🙄
I need this in ps4
''Are you a calm reasonable person?"  Kratos activates spartan rage "YES"
Tyr: stands up and gives kratos the death stare Kratos: hercules was taller….and chunkier too
Porque Tyr parce Jesucristo?
Only ps5?
Ghost of Sparta is what came to my mind at this very moment: 1:57. Kratos's skin clearly white compared to Atreus. I loved that reference
Getting this no matter what
😍😍😍😍
HELA ?
This is going to be another emotional game for Kratos. Can't wait to see him try to lead again.
I love how Atreus walks in with those antlers looking like Loki
I'm in love with PS Exclusives
Virgin Kratos getting MOGGED by Chad Tyr How can GOW player even compete?
Kleitao bom de guerra tá de volta
Boy
I HAVE WATCHED THIS 203 TIMES ALREADY
isso ta incrível. esse jogo vai ser épico pra crl dnv
In moments of crisis Panic does nothing Harness it Let it serve you  Who else got goosebumps?!
This is PaRappa The Rapper 3?
now go look at gta v for ps5 ... and try to compare
Black person on viking myths ... yeah no. Discarded.
Atreus:" Think like a General" Everyone: Gasps😬
angbora look young and old at the same time..
Gameplay looks a lot like the old one. Wish they made this a ps5 exclusive. Still I’m so hyped for this game.
If this is the middle of a new trilogy, then expect the return of "the general" in the finale
Idont hav many to i tek the game
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS GAME🔥🔥🔥
Now he's a teenager, there's no boi jokes anymore 😔
Atreus triggered Kratos`s PTSD with the " Start thinking like a general", that poor boy needs to learn what happened to his father`s old family when he was thinking like a general.
garbage
more the same, where is the new game play concepts? This is getting old!
I'm calling it: the one who speaks about "calm reasonable person" isnt Thor but Tyr.
What ????? Only on ps5 ????? No ps4????????
Everyone favorite gaming duo is back the famous Kratos And Boi.
Supreme
We need it in steam🌷
how did kratos go from greek mythology to norse
1:32 this place give me gow ascension vibe
Yes yes im waiting this for long boooiii
اييييه ايام وقت كان اتريوس فرفور صغير و غضبة
daqui a 10 anos eu jogo :')
Tyr has two hands.   Fenrir: Okay bro, you know the rule.
Do we need a better reason to buy a ps5 ?
I thought they will change the game play and let the game better because the dodge it's stupid sometimes
Who's the out-of-place non-white at the end? 🤔
:,( que pobreza!
nice DLC
After a long time
Atreus seems like a Chelsea player from FIFA.
This reminds me of a game I used to play
I shall play this game.
When will be available??
почему блять в игре про скандинавских богов бегают каки это негры ?
I love these series
Looks like aesthetically, the weapons go back to their level 1 looks from gow4
Wow 😍❤️🇩🇿
okay guys, now you sold me PS5. Ok ok congatz
UUUFFFFF, que salga ya.
Can we all appreciate the fact that Boy was able to hunt a deer by his own? He has grown up.
Nothing against some giants being human sized, but isn't there a giant sized giant alive?
lets hope that they dont ruin this game too
Vamos q la ps5 no me sirve para nada...xD
This game cannot come soon enough. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I Don't Wait
Cant wait to play this!!!!! (I rlly hope it wont be released at the end of 2022)
Last time they put norse gods, an axe, a hammer and a shield together, it didn’t end well 😕
Guys i think that this game might not be the final part
No ones is talking about how it shows Loki can finally hunt on his own… he’s growing up…. ( tear drop )
Looks like we'll  fight Asgardians. That looks like the Bifrost beam 2:12
Shut up and get my kidney  (Cuz i have to buy a ps5 too)
I wonder if we'll get a look at Fenris Wolf in the game
Dios que buenos gráficos, madre mía que buenos, que buenoooos
This literally gives chills wish they release it on ps4 too
Nabghiiik Kratos Dz
Daddy  kratos is back
The ****? Coloured person in this lands? What the... I am nor racist, but this <<improvements>> made to saticfy liberal societies are so... bad
Hercules is taller and bigger than Tyr. Nothing to see here.
So Tyr! What's the over/under that is actually Odin? Cause isn't Tyr suppose to be missing a hand or arm?
I can guess that the release of the game will be in 2023
Top Demais, se Deus Quiser vamos fazer série no canal
Why did they show tyr in this? I feel like it would have been a dope surprise
Thor: YOU SEEM LIKE CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON KRATOS: L3 + R3
Why so sad Xbox Game Pass...
Op  loved the trailer so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can't say I remember too many figures in norse mythology who look like 3:05 🤔
I have a strong feeling that Tyr will be a villain in this game.
Please release the game in ps4
LESS GOOO
CHILLS
My Body Is Ready
Tiringa cú de gambá
Thor looks like thor  in end game😂😂
Eu amo o kratos sou fã, ele não pode morrer viu Santa Mônica!!
Just gonna say, Game of the year and it’s just the trailer 😅
Tyr has hieroglyphs in his left arm.
The Greatest Game Of All Time!
FINALLY
Félicitations pour ça
c'est tellement propre :O
Está de volta o nosso deus dos consoles
When One is a Gamer, they can give a 1,000 lives.
Black Angrboda?????  right sony thks for garbage, make Odin an asian guy...
Showing Tyr now was a bad idea, shouldve let the players find out in game. I felt spoiled 😔
esse trailer tá simplesmente MAGNÍFICO 🥶🤌 nosso CLAITOS  tá de voltaaaa🤧😭 pra espanca a cara de deuses fracos🧢🤙
Les go
It's not fair if it release only for ps5, please make it on ps4 too 🙏
Black-skinned people in the Slavic Folklore 2021
Why would they ruin the suprise of Tyr and thor? Stupid
Song name 00.22
they change the voice of kratos?
Pls come to ps4 too 😢
Should be called "gods of war ragnarok"
YESSSSSSSSSSS
I'm already rubbing my hands
só eu acho meio bizarro o deus da guerra tá perdendo tempo com um peruano?
this is amazing and can't wait to buy it or pre order it.
EPIC EPIC EPIC ENOUGH SAID
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I don' t have word
Kratos: "which way do we go?"  Atreus: "In the direction of Tyr"
Tÿr
3:03 HWhahahahHAHAHAH lol
Same game, same graphics. Why are you all so hyped?
Its a BIG boy!
Another button mashing exclusive
Its for ps4 too and not only for ps5
El nalgon.
HYPE HYPE HYPE
PS4 GAME haha
Okay only problem is the black girl at the end not racist but there wouldn’t be anyone of African decent in like Sweden at that time yk just historical inaccuracy unless I’m wrong I maybe wrong but idk who knows look it up if I’m wrong then I’m wrong
Hola buenas tardes
I haven't been this hyped for a game in a long time. Don't even have a system to play on, but everything changes when the prophecy of Ragnarok comes true!
:)
This trailer gave me so much chills
I almost forgot to watch this masterpiece today
will it be on ps4
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”     Kratos: "I AM ZLATAN"
They really dropped the ball not making a game of this scale a ps5 exclusive
Bff
Russian public: Подскажите когда выйдет данная игра ?
Beautiful
Goooosebumpssss
THIS IS COLDDDDDDDDDDDD
Unfortunately, Leiía turned against them
Не ожидал прогиба гуд оф вара под лгбт всю атмосферу в уонце испортили
Love the trailer!  Honestly, it looks like more GOW 2018 visually but it's still going to be a wonderful game! 🤩
I like the design of angrboda, the thought of the giants having the physical appearance of black people and the majority of asgard being white is very realistic to modern day society, very creative on the designer and writers part.
“Boy” became a big boy now
Chills my boys, all chills. Cant wait for this one
I've been waiting to murk Thor or Odin my whole life! Going for platinum on this forsure
Who else been watching this trailer everyday since the reveal?
Comming soon ?!
My body IS prepared
Who’s the guy at the end of the trailer anybody know ?
I remember when my mom bought me Chains of Olimpus when I was 11 for my PSP,  I'm so exited to buy Ragnarok!!!!
Boi stupid as ever...
eu iesa neugraaaa aual finuaaaaal😵😵😵
Meh.
While it looks no different from GOW 2018, technically or mechanically, I'm not sure we need it to be.
Xbox >ps
GOTY
Anyone knows if the game is coming for ps4 too or is only for ps5?
How tall is kratos
Black girl in scandinavia, nothing dumber I've seen
Incredible is all I have to say.... crazy graphics!
0:56 ooh man Freya was actually able to break Kratos shield, that shows how much motivated she is 2:12 where did he came from
OURR KRATOS !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Didn't know Angrboda was African deity. Imagine the scale of psychosis if someone in pop culture would paint skin of certain mythological figure of certain African tribe white?
Yessir
gotta put that diversity quota
Most expensive game with console ps 5 😌😌😌
lets hope we dont  have to fight the same troll boss fight over and over again
no veo la hora de jugarlo
Imagine Cratos and Tyr fighting other gods together, especially that wolf of Azgard😋🤗😍
Kinda wish they just left the last one alone... would be nice to have a perfect game standalone
For starters, you only need to learn this word: "BOIII!"
Is coming for ps4 too?
എന്റെ മോനെ പവർ 🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
"mitología nórdicas" y ponen una negra, lol
Pode vir thor, odin e o caramba à quatro
Boy boy boy boy this is no place for a boy boy boy boy whach your tongue boy
Music is so well accorded with the impact of the fists from Kratos I love it. 2:12
Santa Monica!!! LOS AMO
Alguien que sepa donde puedo vender mis riñones para poder comprar la play 5?😔
For ps4?
Hold on a minute, I thought that Odin stole freya's fighting spirit so that she cannot fight or defend herself. Then how did she attack Kratos?
Fantastic
been waiting for dis for 2 years . Finally !
I don't understand how tf GOW became Assassins Creed Valhalla.
Que lo pongan para la Ps4 por Diooosss!!!!
No PS4 edition :( Edit: Yes this will have a PS4 version but Spider-man 2 and Wolverine will not.
My theory is, Tyr is Atreus/Loki from the future. I mean it kind of makes sense? You saw how big Tyr is, like half giant?
Bruh if Thor theme isn’t a remixed version of Sons of Thunder, I’m going to cry (I’ll cry anyway because I’ll love this game)
We dream of enjoying and fascinating with higher graphics quality with PS5 and improved gameplay than before
This game jast for  ps5 or ps4 and ps5
this  is awesome playstation all I need is for you to send me a ps5 and I can buy this game
And the most incredible part about this is that this is mostly all actual gameplay.
4.2k dislikes looks like a certain set of individuals are bitter...wonder who they are?...
O You either make the mistake to only watch it like you'd watch a movie as i did for the last one...  △ You get your hands on a ps5 and play the game...
Can't wait to get my hands on that fat dobber, Thor.
Let the Ragnarok begin!
xbox got what????
i cant wait im so excited
I hoped there is a video in this world that's doesn't get any dislike that " Should be this ONE " But then there are these people, these people must not be here, PlayStation must not sell this precious masterpiece of a game to these junkies...
Ñ
"War is not the only way" What have you been doing in the last 4 games?
Cant wait
السلام عليكم و رحمة الله هذا تعليق بيني بين نفسي (لحد يدخل) حطيته بتاريخ 11/9/21 كنت قاعد اكل كيك و شفت التريلر و عجبني بس ما عجبني بحكم اني لاعب كل الأجزاء الي فاتت وكذا المهم برجع بعد ما تنزل اللعبه و اعطيكم رأيي و ان شاء الله تطلع حلوه يلا السلام عليكم...
if this is coming out 2023 its going to be a big year for playstation
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Leave...my...home.
Goty 2022
2:50 Mandela effect
It’s the guy from fortnite!!!!😱
The level of detail is no joke, I mean like this literally feels like the realistic cgi Disney movies like the lion King or Mowgli.
👍   🙌   🕺   👏   🤪
Finally Its Back💯🔥
People saying that the girl is angerboda(I don't know the spelling) Anyway, according to norse mythology she is the mate of atreus/loki  and the mother of the beasts:fenrir,world serpent I don't I'm hyped af.
Я просто кончил от видов сварталтхейма и замёрзшего озёра девяти
I'm glad they made this for PS5, it looks AMAZING.
I feel like there's going to be a another game after this one, also this and the last one can be a show or movie
why cant nintendo do this, they only make mario mario mario...
Classic black vikings
Yeeeeees!
Boy.
The wait is over boii!..
Atreus: I want answers! Kratos: Yes, I'm already vaccinated.
Único jogo capaz de justificar todo o Hipe do povo , Obrigado Santa Monica
Yeaaaa boyyyy!
Not getting covid was worth it
Amazing 😍
Glad its coming to PS4 too
Por favor por favor que regrese el control clásico 😢😢😭😭
They're going to hide Odin from all the trailers and marketing because he's going to be the final boss
Boy
Cool trailer DA
IT WILL SUPPORT TO PS4 PRO
BOY i can't wait
hype
Boy.
There was only a stain in an otherwise perfect trailer: FORCED "REPRESENTATION"
Gow  ragnarok gonna be available on PS4 too??
CTM ES LA WEA AS INCREIBLE
That fur is so fire
this feels like marvel
BOOOIIIIII come here boi
Is it the game on playstation 4 or not?
That deeper voice caught me off guard 🥺❤️
I hope deimos returns
Un fuerte abrazo para todas las personas como yo Que no tenemos un Kratos como padre pero nuestros padres son Como Kratos XDD !! <3
I can't wait to see thor face off with kratos
There's like really nothing changed with graphics or gameplay
sheeeeeeshhhh
الجزاء الأخير ممل ال٣ الاوله ممتازه
Ps5 dont have any games yet......bored
I don't mind a fat Thor, honestly. Also, this ain't Marvel's Thor.
Bro why these graphics so lame ?  No difference btw ps4 n ps5.
REWATCH: NUMBER 78
*Tyr join Kratos* Thor to Odin : "This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"
I was really worried about the original director not being part of this GOW but this trailer puts my mind at ease… At least we still get Bear McCreary 🙌🏾
this looks insane!
Wait minute who’s  tyr 😂
glad to see the boy is still as annoying as ever
Boy!!
Wait who is that tall dude at the end?
interracial of war
Dygnął
Dad of Boi, soon to return! So hyped for this - now I just need the PS5...
Game pass!!!!
thor😂
You seem like a calm and reasonable person  Dialogue plays when kratos does some perfectly ‘calm and reasonable’ stuff
this game waiting excitement
The boy sounds like Tom Holland
Mais um sucesso de jogos da franquia
👏👏👑👑
Would love to see Thor with his goats!
Hi
2:13 the remix of the music of teaser of GOW3 is awesome. Panic is Nothing/fear is Nothing
PC? Or nothing?
Hammer Kohleeimer
KRATOS TA ON !!!
Tyr: You do not want this fight  Kratos: ouh... I'm pretty sure I do
BOOOYYYY
They had to squeeze in the diversity hire at the end to make sure we watched the whole thing.
RIP Ps4 users
2:13 What is the name of the background music playing?
Can't wait to play this on Youtube.
PlayStation will always be the better console purely for their exclusive titles
Same graphics with the old one🙂
McDonald’s chegou em asgard
Ma man Atreus looks so dope
no date or sometin ? i don't want to hype too much but i can't
i just wish Atreus voice was the same.
I can already see Kratos calling Angrboda, “Girl/Gurl” going forward!  Gurl! Read it! Gurl! Over here! Gurl! To Me! Gurl! Be back with my Boi before curfew!
And at the end POLITICALLY CORRECTLY stabs us in the back!!!
Круто
Will this be available for ps4
Doesn't look that much of an improvement in terms of graphics compared to gow4
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
epicoooooooooooooooo
Kratos immediately having Vietnam flashbacks
Didn't know black women existed in Norse mythology
Tyr standing tall in front of Kratos.  Cronos: - *giggle* - he's in danger.
Will this also be on ps4?
Uou
Disgusting!!!!
It looks like an DLC...
Ну всё
اول عربي و راح تجي العبه
I love this game 💪
Una porquería hermano.. que fraude .aguante XBOX perro..
They say , its the Last Game...do we not Fight Odin ?!
Ahhh yes finallyy
Já tô aqui pela décima vez, o hype tá absurdo!!!
Why try to hide that the game will come out on PS4? why didn't they mention PS4 in the title of the trailer?
!THIS AWESOME¡, finally comes this legendary hit, with much more action, drama and adventure than ever, seems that with the imminent arrival of the Ragnarok all things become  from bad tho worst, alongside a array of unexpected consequences, anyway still a thrilled long awaited adventure,  this will be epic.
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪😍
Only on ps5???
For all of those who don't know who the girl at the end is, she is Angrboða, a jötunn in Norse mythology. She is the mate of Loki and the mother of monsters. She is only mentioned once in the Poetic Edda as the mother of Fenrir by Loki.
Why is Angrboða black? I thought this was norse mythology.  It's like Shango being white. Stop race changes and identity politics please, especially not in GOW
Ps4 is available
Que trailer de mierda
josh brolin est thor? or Tyr?
Is it just me or do I hear Tom Holland's voice?
I must not buy a ps5 just to play this game.  I must not buy a ps5 just to play this game. I must -not- buy a ps5 just to play this game.
F por rubius 😔👌
So the game is still the same just more dialogue. love it
wow😍
PS4 ?
Muitoooooooo fodaaaaaa o tir e maior que o kratos
Looks awesome, I can't wait to play it.
Rid it boy
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
We better have a full Ragnarok war. Not some bs build up that leads to a cliffhanger for ragnarok pt 2
Can anyone tell me when is this game launching?
Can't wait for Kratos to bash Thor's head with the Mjolnir.
Não vejo a hora de chegar esse jogo
This looks okay.
I like the way this trailer intro reflected gow4 with kratos emerging from the darkness now it’s Atreus
Woahh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are black ppl in this game? Can you not even rest from them once?
عظمة👌👌👌
Who's that guy in the last scene?
Yes, please and than you
WHEN???
I cant't wait 😍 only the release date is missing 😍
Ansioso por esta Obra Prima
Please take your time. We’re patient enough.
Nice animation but when can play at pc
Kis Kis ko launch date ka intezar hai
Is this only gonna be on the ps5
To think this is all started with Kratos just wanting to kill Ares by finding Pandora's box lol
Woooooo 👏🏻❤️
Ya sabemos quien va a ser el culito de Atreus
itu beneran pria yang di menit terakhir itu? beneran?
Espectacular ❤️🙌
Have a new lets play about ninja gaiden 2, if you guys want some more inspiration about the game, hav a look on my channel :) Episode #4 is online o.O Have a nice Day :)
BOI.
Oh cool, black washing white characters again. Because creating new black characters is so hard to do. Sony is peak woke
I have never cared to have a PS system, especially the new generations: until now.
Kratos for President 2024
Tom Holland : Atreus Michelle Jones : Little Girl In Ending Trailer?
Kratosssssssss and that hammerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Pirating this as soon as it comes out.
I wanted to ride a dragons... after I free them...also I wanted to fight the world serpent.. but I guess... he's too big and there's just too much to fight him...I also guess that kratos never rode a dragon before..m
Missing the old GOW 😢
Me: “When is the official release date?” Santa Monica: 3:01
Дикий фейспалм с Ангербоды, дотерасились в край, наркоманы штолэ
“You need to stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!”  “NO!”  Kratos really doesn’t want to even consider going back to what he was. He’s come a long way from the man he was in Sparta
🔥🔥goosebumps 🔥🔥
This trailer is just perfection.
This will be amazing ..long live Kratos
Angrboda appears.... Atreus/Loki: Me likey 😍😍😍
Thor's voice is actually menacing.
BOY
Que se inicia as teorias brasil sz
Dad of Boi. Now with more teen angst.
Wow
This is masterpiece, love it!
Will play the inevitable PC version.
Ahhh yes black norse mythology character gotta be my favorite
Что за негритянка ещё??? Что за бред????
I hope this can be the game of year again
Abaixa mais o preço do PS5
Goosebumps like never before
The last time someone stud up in kratos face was hercules and we all know what happened to him 🤫
Loki, Kratos, and Tyr Fighting Asgard?! Can't wait to play it
الذي أريد معرفته هو ماذا حصل لثور ؟
Cara é tao incrivel .
How could they spoil something so epic as them finding Tyr...  SMH... Game and Film companies are stupid...
it'll be nice if we can get a bit of gameplay regarding Kratos meeting Faye, before this all began. I can already see it.  Kratos: *WOMAN* Faye: sigh.... Faye: What shall we name our son? Kratos: *BOI*
At around 2:31, Kratos is fighting what I'm pretty sure is a centaur. Centaurs are, as far as I'm aware, only found in Greek and not in Norse mythology. Are we going back to Greece?!?!?
India fan like here
Imagine Tyr while sitting is the same height as Kratos and Imagine again that Kratos height is 2 metres big..
Goddammit!!! I need this game right now!!!!
Superb Trailer ❤️❤️❤️
Pico yes !
Rodis gamova es dedamotynuli
Это ШЕДЕВР!!!

Wipe off dust from PS4.. "You ready boi?"
I'm so exited I can't wait for this to drop
It’s amazing
Fur cape❤️‍🔥
We got sled wolves everybody, we got em
Boi almost a mane.
Who is the girl in the end supposed to be?
This looks like a fkin dlc.
This only gonna be available on PS5?! 😭
wow
Lesssss goooo
Who is the voice actor for Atreus in this? Ngl his voice is GRATING my ears
This looks incredible
新瓶舊酒
I hope is on ps4
This looks flat, the lighting isn't right.  Also there is notable lod pop, this should not be a thing on PS5.  Looks cross gen IMO, not impressed.
🔥🔥🔥
Why does Tyr have both hands?
What about us PS4 owners? Do we have no choice but to buy a PS5? 🥺🥺🥺
Dont forget guys.  Show the black girl at the end to make people know we're not racist or sexist
angrboda is a frost giant from ac valhalla
Cory barlog didnt make this game so dont think its gonna be a goty
4.1k dislikes ? hhh Xbox boys ?
Great. Now I have a reason to buy a ps5!
I can already tell kratos treats atreus like an equal (to some extent). Also ma boy Tyr is huuge ... I cant wait
I think Graphics is literally the same
как купить PS5 что бы играть в это вечно
i really hope they keep the one-camera-only thing cause it looked really nice.
Ofc it ends with diverse female character, go shove it sony
At the end the Swedish from 2021 is multicultural? As I understand it!? Because of this, I will not buy. With love from Russia. P.S. To the Swedes.
Kratos: are You coming whit us  Me : take me xD
what are these wolves called again?
Finally
THE KING HAS RETURNED.
Awesome
"Are you a calm and resonable person?" Greek mythology: *(Y) Doubt*
boy is big boy
This is how you make a game trailer
This.... is how you eat a big mac
I see DISLIKES from Zelda fanboys who still think that their game will win GOTY in 2022.
YouTube got Personal when they age restricted this
AMAZING!!!
I'd love to play this game with amon amarth songs as soundtrack
Love the foreshadowing of Loki's horns.
why is thor fat
Dad of War: Tennagerok
so when does the gameplay demo will be available?  😱😱😱
boy look at tyr
Lower your expectations boy, and you will never be disappointed
Boyyyyyyyyy
I can already see Kratos using Thor's hammer
On end scene that young zeus??
0:22 a foreshadowing of Atreus becoming Loki. That definitely looks like Loki's helmet
I'm glad that now everyone sees Kratos as a calm and reasonable person as he really is.
Did... did they add 2 PlayStation logos in the beginning?
calling it now tyr will be Odin in disguise he will help us for a while before tricking us and taking loki back to Asgard with him
From today i'm gonna start saving my pocket money
че за хуй в конце?
Ora si putos ya se armó el dios de la guerra
Не плохо
1:37 what is Kevin Hart doing in GOW?
Although this was one of the eagerly anticipated game on everyone list….it’s grand theft auto 6 and metal gear solid remake that the whole world is waiting to be announced
Comunque Kratos è uguale a Zeb89
PS4 please!
boy
Ooo look a black girl in ragnarok.. Lets go woke again.. Fail gow
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person? Me : Nooo! I want a release date...
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person” wdym is that Kratos you’re talking about because he ain’t calm or reasonable
Absolutely... Wow 😍
End of 2022 release date 👍🏽
LETS GO LAMONT WOOO YOURE PLAYING THIS KING WOOOOOOOOOOO
PLEASE BE AVAILABLE ON PC AS WELL!!!
Didn't this come out like a year ago?
Yeaaaaaaah!
Опа вот это ништяк
@ShreemanLegend
now question is will be on ps4 tho?
Я дождался...
I miss Mimir
Bro this looks amazing, kratos still has the blades I can't wait for this game
This is why you don’t get xbox
Somebody please help, I can't stop watching this trailer!
This is Epic
Pobrecitos los nórdicos si logran despertar nuevamente a ese Kratos que se cargó a todo el Olimpo en GOW 3.
who else is coming back to rewatch for the 538257th time *already?*
BOY
So atreus looks and sounds like one of those whiney complaining androgynous types
I’ve rewatched this too many times and can conclude that Ragnarok is going to be epic and they haven’t even shown any of it yet!
Atreus:stop acting like a father and start acting like a general Kratos: so you have chosen death
wow..!!
Cómo que no va a estar en play 4
Of course they had to race swap Angrboda
Boi has grown up! I finally have a game I can destroy my controller with again!
Brasil 🇧🇷 ?
LET'S GOOO
This animation looks so 2010 XD
Bro wow this got almost the same amount of views in 1 day as the previous game did in 1 year MAD
Can somebody say who is this man? 2:50
🥲🥲🥲🦍🦍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
looks kinda trash tbh...
WOW he is back with more power :)
Since it’s Ragnarok, will we see Surtr or will we have Kratos taken the place wielding Lævateinn or tempered his Blades of Chaos with Surtr flame?
goosebumps just goosebumps
I cant understand the people who put dislike ...im waiting for the sequel .
I cant br the only one that want it in my veins and i want it now
Looks like repeat. Boring
YOOOOOOO
vaaaavvv yes yes yes
KRATOS IS BACK
Go back to MHW, Aiden.
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”   -Gods of Olympus have left the chat
Just Wow.
That stupid son annoys me🙄 Always whining... I wish I can play Kratos only... rather being a babysitter who whines all the time..
They have Loki’s future wife and mother of his kids(Fenrir, world serpent) in this game. This will be epic 🔥
LETS FUCING GOOOO
2:10 so we are going to see a fight between KRATOS and THOR WHOAAAAAA!!!
Loki:“Think like a general and like a father”  Kratos: “No”   Man Kratos has grown so much. Old Kratos would never 😩
Топчик
Coi mà nổi cả da gà.
take my credit card please.... :{
However the rest of the game will be. If you bring back those revenants and explosive draugers ill get a refund!
Black Woman in Scandinavia...  I wont contribute this anymore, i will buy the game second hand
MIMIR!!!!!!!
How old is the black girl at the end 😳
Atreus triggered Kratos`s PTSD with the " Start thinking like a general", that poor boy needs to learn what happened to his father`s old family when he was thinking like a general.
"Are you calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: Yes, Fat Boy!
*Tyr towering over Kratos* Kratos: “Hercules was taller.”
I wish it was open world like Horizon Zero Dawn. Or is it?
This looks so unreal! I cannot wait!!!😍
Pls let me keep my Zeus armor
Ghost of sparta Coming back
I don't know. A lot of the areas looked prosaic... yet, the development team has always, ultimately, delivered spectacle. We'll see.
Modi is alive bois he will help kratos
Game of the year 2022
TBH I would have voted for TYR in a fight against Kratos if kratos was not the playable character
Ps4
i cant wait
Disappointed 😔
👍
Quiero que aparezca thor jugando al Fortnite
nice game
are you a calm and reasonable person? *flashbacks to kratos ripping of helios' head*
Quiero que aparezca el superman soviético
I love the trailer  😍😘😘😭😭 ow Thanku  sony
Yehhhhh finally is here
Yo quiero que aparezca Batman chipeado
1:15 when Mimir said: Odin has his own trump cards up his sleeve.  We can see two Ravens.  I think it's Hugin and Munin (Odin's Ravens)
هل انا العربي الوحيد
BKL pc pe bhi release krdo yaar🙏🙏🙏🙏
From Morocco
Is that tom holland's voice?????
I am waiting thank you
Poor Thor.
"Kratos help me"
And now, officially, Game of the Year.
I wanna play It. I wanna play It. I wanna play It!!!
Last time Kratos was thinking like a General he slaughtered his family
obe Thor
Will there be a GOW 5? I mean after GOW 1 or 2 they made GOW Ghost Of Sparta & after it they made GOW 3 and they completed the main series ,so what do you think guys?
Hope the gameplay feels nicer, the previous one was a bit clunky to me, something more fluid would be nice, I prefer the older games in that respect
Jeua da kratso
@KuplinovPlay
I’ve watched this trailer around 100 times, not even an exaggeration😂 it’s in my mind 24/7. Ragnarok is coming!!!
quien mas estuvo esperando esta obra de arte 😃
Can we get some more love for Freya? So excited for her new design. From a cheery goddess of the forest  to a distraught loner seeking revenge. Can't wait for her inevitable duality in being both friend and foe, and excited for what probably will be our Valkyrie Queen of Ragnarok.
The lake of Nine looks Frozen. I'm wondering what happened to my boy Jormungandr!
Whennnnn
Kratos: are you coming with us? Tyr: *stands up* ...no.. *sits back* Kratos: *stares at Boi intensely* what. did. you. MISS? Boi: I.. i don't know.. I may have forgotten to flip some switches maybe? put some trinkets into the thingamabobs? lighten up the torches? or.. OR... Maybe.. he needs herbs? Kratos: *mumbles* "MaYbE hE NeEd HeRbS" why am i even doing this? this is crazy.. *Sighs*
Зачем слили информацию про Тюра
🙏Please let the map not just be a "reskin" 🙏Please let there be more bossfights
Super Awesome
OMFG
I want to remind you that by Ragnarok, Loki already had children, one of whom was a"massive intelligent serpent" who would kill Thor, could this not mean that we will have a second world serpent who will be the son of Atreus... and then what will become of Kratos?
Imagine if Asian mythology had white people
AWSOME
Masterpiece
Ragnarok is coming
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
will it work in ps4??
I want to see some free roam in this game
Oh, I'm recognize this scandinavian goddess at 3:04!  This is Peter Parker's girlfriend from Marvel's Spider-Man!
Why do I want Tyr to be voiced by Keanu Reeves now? 😂
Underwhelming trailer imo. And I’m a fan since gow 1
Me vuelvo loco
May be I just had high hopes 🤷🏻‍♂️
Is that Storm Breaker??
1:14 is that the eye of the serpent of the world?????
Thor: are calm and reasonable person Kratos: hmmm (spartan rage)
GOW should collaborate with MARVEL
Why it feels like.... A DLC (no offence)
🇳🇪 ANGRBODA 🇳🇪
Gta sa
PlayStation Is Number One!!
Yea this is it.. i want to know why the light elves got slaughtered..
Welp, atreus will get a girlfriend
Who is that tall guy?
Thor seems like a really bad judge of character😂😂😂.... Calm and reasonable 😂😂
yooo
역시 크레이토스형 크앙
Another game of DAD AND BOI
Is josh brolin voicing thor, sounds alot like him
Lets go!!!!
the final girl is angrboda, mother of fenrir in the norse muthology, so... i guess tatreus and her are going to have .... at some point to make fenrir
I am hoping that it will be available in ps4
Looks a great game but then the box ticking starts so im out of this one
Atreus: Stop thinking like a dad! Kratos ŃÖ!!
***THANOS HAS ENTERED THE CHAT****😂
Finally
Ok can we talk about the themes? Love them already!
Why is there a dark skinned girl in this game? This is a game about European mythology. And that girl is the wife of Loki iirc.   I really don't see a need to make her a dark skinned person unless the game is directed by a woke idiot
Hmm, what African American girl does in there?
for those of you who didn't notice 2:54 is the easter egg of Kratos vs Hercules in gow 3
and freya vs kratos and the size of tyer
в русской озвучке лучше звучит кратос, а тут какой то парень делает вид типа хрипой
By the looks of this trailer none of my complaints with the previous games have been addressed
Angrboda in Norse mythology is actually the mother of Loki's children
he is now a father not a general
Im over the new Dad Of War
Um is this a ps5 game? Looks literally no different than the ps4 graphics
This needs a billion views and likes.
Não vejo a hora 😎💥🤯😱
4k 120fps but on pc............
Why are stupid kids in it for ?
plezzzz release for ps4 plzzzzz
Someone give me ps5 for playing this game ;-;
Keşke bende oynayabilsem
Boys get ready we're going to smash alien mythology's next
I guess Atreus finally knows the direction of deer 🤣
Same copy paste from previous gow...
Will I be able to stomach another game of Atreus bickering? I don't know.
Tamil dub plZzz
Is this on ps4??
Tyr's eyes are similar to Mimir
Dose it com only inn ps5?
Oh yeah, black characters in norse mythology.
BOYYYYY !!
Did they just spoil finding Tyr? o.O  For the rest awesome video. Can't wait!
I literally cried tears of joy watching this trailer
Release date?
Will it be available on PS4?
Atreus will be the main villain of the game, or at least will be set up to become the villain of the next GOW game!...I'm calling it!
3:05 dislike  More politics in your games, please! =/
do you guys by any chance know if this is coming to ps4?
4K dislike I mean why,  those who disliked this should not play games anymore.
Atreus is Loki
Is we going to have the same moves again 🤦🏽‍♂️
Tyr looks like he’s OP but too pacifist to fight
Isn’t there a ps4 version??
I want to have more crazy finishing move !!!
I heard this game can also be played on PS4 is that true??? Plz I need to know
Shut up and take my virginity
BOY!
Kratos reminds me of Mike Tyson , super wild and angry when young but grow up to be the old man that give life lessons
Alright i’m gonna buy a ps5  Oh wait… nevermind
НУЖНО БОЛЬШЕ НЕГРОВ! НУЖНО БОЛЬШЕ НЕГРОВ! НУЖНО БОЛЬШЕ НЕГРОВ!
Floki your Angrboda is still alive
Please excuse me Guys Who is Tyr?
You seem like a clam and reasonable person he said
Как негры в скандинавскую мифологию просочились?
Bro the HYPEE
Madness! Can't wait
Yo boys this GOT ME SMILING LIKE!!!! YESSSSSSSS
Looks like it could've been just a DLC lol
Finally, finally, finally, finally  Finally trailer 😍😘🤗 Finally after wait of many years is over.... Time to become Sherlock Holmes...
People who say this is not a graphical upgrade need your eyes checked the detail in the game is crazy and I bet this is a early build also
IM  READY FOR WARRRRRRRRRRRR
Eh, it's satisfactory. I expect it to be better.
One day, we will play it on our phones without even downloading it. Without internet.
I got flashbacks of pressing O for two minutes straight when Thor asked whether Kratos is calm and reasonable.
openingnya ps ngajak ribut
3:06 why she looks like gorilla she must be white but as always blackwashing as it finest
Wow!!! it’s amazing i can’t wait
I like how there are probably more cuts in this trailer than in the finished game.
Angrboða is from Africa?? 0_o
Possible to download. PS4 Belize
i m literally crying why this is not on ps4😭😭😭😭
I want to play but I don't have Playstation 5
Please make a Ukrainian localization
"Its the guy from fortnite"
The girl we saw at the end was Loki's girl friend
Como no se inglés no entendí nada de lo que dijeron solo se que aparece thor
For me... It needs more weapons
Ryan Hurst as Thor....perfecto❤️
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”. No. No I do not think Kratos is a calm and reasonable person. Reasonable? Maybe.
Would kratos show us some of his old side?
3:05 quota
best game series ever
кто это был в конце? иисус? зевс?
Looks the same as the last game. Not buying this
How difficult should it be to pronounce Ragnarök correctly?  A tip is to ask one of us in Scandinavia how to pronounce words from our culture.
😍😍😍
I'm very happy to see Kratos again 💙😍
You thought Thor was Zeus? Wth?
WE
May be one day when it comes to pc,  I will play with my grandkids..... 😀😚...
why is there an asian in Norse Mythology
Is it me!? Tyr looks like kratos with hair
Jesss !!! 😭
Let’s go ❤️
You said 'General'?...My Boi doesn't know what it looks like to be a Spartan General.. *"Wiping out the Entire God's of Olympus"*
KRATOS ♥️
The PS4s are gonna melt
After i saw this i dont want to play any other games lol 😅
4 million views in one day
Estará disponible igual para PS4??
Чернокожая в Скандинавии?
Everybody gangsta until Kratos is no longer reasonable
This will be a master piece i dont think in this one Kratos will thinking like a gentle Man.
Don’t be distracted: Global government has declared war on the people and vaccines are their silent weapon of choice
i hope this will be on ps4 as well
probably another ps4 exclusive remove random crits
I hope Kratos goes back to his savage mood like in gow 1-3.
Shut up and take my money!
Any one see Atreus riding the buck
meh
Its a dissapointment that BOI IS STILL BOI AND NOT MAN
muito fodaaaaaaa!!!!
GOTY
Atreus hit puberty!
This game is a cure for all terrible things that happened in this couple of years
Lindo
Incrível
basically more of the same
Aaaaaaaalvvvvvvvvvvv 😱😱😱😱
Is this for ps5 and ps4?? 😀
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Thanos: I am inevitable.
2:12 I cannot get enough of that music section. It is absolutely beautiful!
Hype bois
Thought tyr was mimir
That horned silhouette of BOY seems like foreshadowing... SO HYPED
This trailer's giving me goosebumps!!
Boy Has Upgraded To: *T E E N*
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a General Kratos: U don't want it
I guess this is the sign!    it's time to buy PS5!
History creating game is coming now
"WAR IS AN EQUATION ,DEATH IS THE SOLUTION" DISTRUPTOR OF DOTA2
BOY!!
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "That is a question you should ask your son."
war is the only way to stop the war
🥶
Holy-
This looks like a big update then another game 😂 tho
Is this a PS5 exclusive or will it be on PC also?
Why does Thor have those sausage fingers?????
العن ام الحماس🔥🔥🔥
0:14 Appreciate you guys showing us the actual version
Ps5 alınacak artık
🙏❤❤❤❤❤
Luego que siguen dragones y emperadores simios de la mitología china? xD
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Oh very
"War is not the only way."  YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY PEACE, NOT JOIN IT!  P.s just a joke guys
SMS devs: don’t come.  Me: IM COMINGGG
Angorboda black? You seriously!?
Glorified DLC
Прослезился аж, наконец-то!!!!!!
Military industrial complex written all over it
"We're so close to the end now."
Release date?
Now I am knowing Tyr is still alive
1:14  "Odins got tricks up his sleeve we haven't even dared to consider"  I wonder if those two crows are Huginn and Muninn?
Mk12 confirmed?
It's the same game nothing new🤕
Hit like if you got a ps5
Teal’c just can’t catch a break when it comes to coming across Thor.😂
So ummm….I think we already know what’s gonna be game of the year now 😈‼️
Графику могли бы и подтянуть!Для некстгена СЛАБОВАТО👎☹
كريفوس
Оооо дааааа
Wish they gave Atreus a longer different hairstyle
GOW3 is awesome, but last parts is bull shet.
Are you ready >BOYS<?
Can someone pls tell me if this is released this year or in 2022
Thank you Playstation and Santa Monica Studio <3
Prevent Ragnarok? I thought Kratos was the bringer of doom
I have so many questions
Finally this masterpiece is back please release it fast for God's sake
La unica razón por la que quiero un ps5 es para jugar está saga hermosa
Ну да, ну да. Как же без повесточки на 3:05 ) напоминаю что это СКАНДИНАВСКАЯ богиня, выглядит очень по местному;))
Zendaya in Scandinavian mythology...
No release date ?
Boi is as annoying as ever and I love it 🤣
There it goes i need a ps5
Even with Ty'rs height, im pretty sure girl would assume he's still too short.
It’s absolutely gorgeous! But black girl in ragnarok?? Im not a racist. That’s focking SCANDINAVIA!🥶
Who is this giant? What is a torus? or someone else aaaaaaaa would come out faster
0:20 I like there’s silhoute of Atreus holding a deer, it’s like Loki wearing his crown. Love the foreshadowing.
I'm a 40year male and right now I have tears 😭 coming down ❤️❤️❤️
Where is @abitbeast
Dudes I’m so excited
Kratos UYIR
Kratos Vs Thor Ang Pagtutuos Philippines is Waiting for the fight to remember
simplemente legendario
É ELE
Omaigad esto va a ser épico papus
finally!!!!
2:45 I thought he was Reanu Keeves
❤👌🔥😍😎🤙👑🤝🤑👍🤘👏
"I will not allow you to pick a fight with the gods " Most ironic thing ever said🤣🤣🤣 By the man whoo destroyed the whole olympus...
I know kratos is the face of this series, but I fear they will kill him off in this game
dude whatttt. I wanna play this so badly.
hope this is not a copy paste game becuase it seems to be that this will be another badass
9/10 he did not say BOI in the trailer.
Might as well give the GAME OF THE YEAR  AWARD now 🤷‍♂️
My body is ready.
This looks like a moded AC Valhalla
I guess the jötnar are black now 🙄
angrboda is the mother of monsters right? so, why is she...you know 9?
My only disappointment was no showcase of new weapons and magic nice to see it is going to be a continuation of the last game like right where it left off from what it looked like.
Me que de así irá •>°
Soooooooooooo Happy❣
Umm... Sorry if I sound like a geek.. But isn't Tyr supposed to have only one hand?? According to the myths, Fenrir the wolf bit off the other.
Wow, i can't wait to watch it on youtube
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General 😂😂😂
Change thor design
This is so much better than anything I could’ve expected
Take my money already
Is that girl at the end a link for a different mythology?
Could Tyr be the final boss in a twist?
Mannn tak sabar nak mainkan game ni
No date????
lets goooooo
2:55 Hercules or wot
Finally, my boy can now hunt deer.
We need a special edition
“Keep your expectations low and you’ll never be disappointed.” - Kratos.
🤩🤩🤩👻
such a amazing trailer i hope game is also amazing
Thor : Are You Ready Kratos : Square Square Triangle O
I don't play games or own a console. This trailer made me feel like I am making a terrible mistake........
So apparently the girl who appeared at the end is supposed to be Angrboða, Loki's 'mate' in the actual Norse myths (and actually the mother of Fenrir, Hel, and Jörmungandr as well. Huh, so Atreus is gonna have a girlfriend in this one xD.  Looking forward to see what role she will play in this.
And the goty 2022 goes to…
Time to get a ps5 for this game
GOTY 2022 NO DOUBT IN MY MIND!!!!
Atreus went from "Boi" to "tween"
Why does this look like graphics using the PS4 engine. Did these guys not see what Unreal Engine 5 can do? Why does this still look like old gen graphics?
Can’t wait to smash Thor’s head in with Mjölnir, if we don’t get to use Mjölnir after we take off his corpse I will be very disappointed
Why a black chick in Norse mythology? If it was the other way round people would be flipping out.
Finally! Looking forward to this rebooted sequel!!!! And the girl at the end was such a nice change up! I am excited! 😀✌️
Special edition GOW PS5 faceplates coming too? 🙏🏻
Yeah I'm buying this
Boy: Part II. 🤣 All jokes aside, day one buy!
Incredible
Looks like ps4 tráiler
the kratos movies seems like the season 4 also the gameplay is has a lot of similarities as season 4 which I really appreciate ❤❤
3:04 That's Angraboda, Loki's (or in this case, Atreus') Wife. She is Mother of Jormungandur, Fenrir, and Hel.
I know it says that it is only for play 5 but please tell me that for 4 too
and this game will be on ps4 ?
*Ni 2 segundos y ya andaba gritando de la emocioooon lym* 💕💕💕 DALE QUE VUELVE KRATOOOS!! 👊😎😎
Oh yeap, my baby is coming. 🙃
Who is the girl in the end?
Oh my, Tyr is a big lad, like Kratos is tall but Tyr be like a whole 2 feet taller
Kratos will do what Lu Bu wasn't able to
Woh, we are getting tyr, that’s awesome. Super pumped for Ragnarok and Forbidden west…
Love your content!! It's so well produced. Stay safe everyone 🌞🌻🌞
2:25  Skaði, Queen of the Hunt, Goddess of Winter, Goddess of Skiing
2:15 "We are especially excited to announce the return of everyones favourite enemies in any video game: The enemy who waits politely for you to do something cool to their buddies before they attack again!"
estubo epico me mie
So blackwashing, fat gods, and a femboy Atreus. Thanks for showing me I don’t need a PS5 or this game Sony 👍👍👍
dlc?)
Im going to watch this trailer till the game comes out
*WELCOME BACK VETERANS !!*
finalyyy yesss my faforite game
Aea pe
Seru nih
I have been literally watching this video for hours now.
I'm so Hyped :D
I am going to utterly destroy any glimmer of hope in these puny worthless fools... Ohh dear they have no idea the carnage of combos I will bless they presence with..
2015 assassins creed?  What’s the hype about, looks outdated with gameplay that’s been done
The look of despair, devastation and controllable fury on Freya’s face is incredible. The game is going to be one helluva ride.
We will have the trilogy after this?
Boy!
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😀😀😀😀😀😀
Thor : you seem like a calm and reasonable person Thanos :reality is often dissapointing
YESS!!!!!
Will this be release in PS4 also?
El comentario en español que buscabas.. Madre miaaa el Bichoooo el bichooo, toma mi dinero maldita sea...
meh
Lo qie se viene señores!!! 😍😍
Witcher of War:  Peace is an option
O bom da guerra no Ragnarok.
Can’t wait to put Freya 5 feet into the ground.
yo i wanna see tyr and kratos fight
Sony, i love you guys. Thank  you for not being rockstar
At least they have more enemy variation instead of just trolls, trolls, trolls and trolls
El mejor juego de mi vida hasta ahora ojalá pudiera tener la play para jugarlo pero almenos puedo vivirlo en un video
Ah, yes. A black girl in Norse Mythology. Perfectly fitting.
Just like a DLC of the previous one..
Who is the small girl in the trailer ?
its will be for PS4 & PS5
Is the last girl Calliope? cuz I wouldn't be surprised if they resurrect old characters and change their ethnicity these days.
That's so great!!
Ok this game will make me buy the ps5
Awesome
Not really excited
Atreus hasn't grow yet😅😅
Tyr is big daddy
kratos should be a motivational speaker 2:24
Need soundtrack starting 0:40 😩
WE'RE FINALLY HITTING VANAHEIM & SVARTALFHEIM, MY BOYS!!!  Freya multiboss fight looks sick! But those Valhalla grunts remind my too much of Hel-walkers and those Seidr-grunts, though... and HEEEEEY, look at those new swordwielding Dark elves! HYPE!!
Yeah I’m switching to PS5 😭
Kratos next aim is asgard
now that's some TOP-TYR soundtracks
ngl this looks lame
Goosebumps... I'm ready
So keen just hope we play as Kratos for the whole game
I imagined Thor’s voice to be a bit more Norse like, bitter like an old man
2:08 ummmm..Just asking ! Is that Thorrrrr !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who's the girl in the last scene?
Why did they change the voice actor for Atreus? he sounds out of character now.
This is the movie not just a game anymore.
Only thing I wish for the game lore to have a human city or civilization, I am always asking wheres all the humans .
Quick Question  Why does Atreus sound like Steven Universe?
BOY RETURNS!
"BLADE OF CHAOS" is back, boys!!
If only i had a ps5
Can't wait for 20+ more hours of hearing "BOY" and "I do not know"
🔥
Не велика разница.
I cannot playing this game because don't have PlayStation 5,but i really excited to wait this game and see my favorite YouTubers play this masterpiece 🤯
Please let us use the blade of Olympus or add more weapons or at least use Thor’s hammer. Lol.
The sad thing is, Kratos really is trying to be a better person. And his beloved Fay is setting him and Atreus up to fail.
que homão
Kraros : It's time to destroy Asgard Gods
THIS WOULD BE A BADASSS!
Sunny Suljic went through puberty! 😮😮😮
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: I will have my revenge.
«Ах, Игорёк, Игорёк пойдёт со мной на Рагнарёк!»
I think Atreues got some mind in Ragnarok
When they release the trailer: You'll get your answers soon enough , well some of them.
more enemies, and probably more bosses too, that's cool!
I spend my most of time in gaming editing and uploading l need my all brothers and sisters support me😔😭😭😭🙏🙏
This and horizon are worth pre-ordering
who is the black chick at the end last i checked there were no black norse gods
🔥🔥🔥
this series may be the only reason i get a ps5
Knew they'd shove it somewhere. I'll pass.
Midgard frozen cuz baldur's death, but kratos seems step on some green land, it is before baldur's death.... time travel ???
This is GOTY already..im calling it now
👍🏻
CANNOT. WAIT.
EL 🙌SEÑOR VIENE PRONTO QUIEN DISE AMEN ❤️
simplemente hermoso
I'll be like a Playstation Fanboy. Wolverine is going to get released on xbox, because Sony has to make it's money back from the Insomniac acquisition. I better not hear about Bethesda game's still going to Playstation. Especially once the contracts have been finalised. It's the end of Bethesda's games for Playstation
Is Atreus even boy anymore?
"War is not the only way"  So there's gonna be a stealth play option? 🤣🤣🤣
BOY
Será q vai ter pra PS4 ??
Did I just hear Josh Brolin
Thor- "You seem" *huffs n puffs* like   *breathes heavy* a calm *deep exhale* and reasonable per--- *heart bursts*
This game is one of the very few out there that does NOT disappoint with their sequels. The reason I love video games right here!
Can’t wait to fight Thor
I need to know when this comes out.........
Xbox fans stop disliking it just cuz ya know ya ain't ever going to have a masterpiece like this and all other master exclusives that we have  It's OK to to cry
Even though I loved the trailer. I feel like it spoiled alittle too much. Showing tyr is  alive, the girl at the end which will be Loki wife, and a triggered fraya.
Негры в конце🤟🤟🤟
I caaaannnnttt wwwaaaiiittttttt <3 <3
then yes, we will be able to use the blades of chaos again, what a joy
Looks awesome, now all I need is a PS5 for under $2000!!
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Yo dad was that rhetorical? Zeus: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm so glad to be here, please visit me
O comentário com mais like no trailer de revelação do gow ragnarok é do LUAN kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
KLEITON IS BACK
Will this be all one take like the last one?
Xbox passa vergonha contra o PS5...e olha que tenho o series S
Really it's insane 😱!!!!!
Guj
Boy
I Love You Sony
Oh Kratos if you thought raising a son was challenging wait till you have to raise a teenage son
If this turns into Kratos' son dealing with gender identity I'll commit suicide for him.
As soon as i saw that hammer i knew kratos is going to take it lol
Love how the opening scene is Loki coming in with his typical worn crown and then it’s just kid Loki. Kinda like Star Wars with Anikans shadow being Darth vader
Ñ
Need boss fight with fenrir
1:08 A Mimir😱
Thumbs down are from xbox fanboys hating!
This game is such a masterpiece 👏 , great job has been done from Santa Monica Studios
Boy is boy, dad yells at boy, boy is sad, boy is always mad, boy is bad, boy is dad
Thor : " Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  *red circle apears above thor*  Kratos : "Yes, im"
tyr is reveal
Gilak mantap bet anjir
That door creak satisfying
can't wait🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😸
this is gonna be insane
While Xbox is so proud about their Halo lol 😂 no disrespect.
Why would they spoil Tyr on the trailer????
I can see it now...Kratos and Atreus won't be stopping Ragnarok...They ARE Ragnarok. Asgard will fall at their hands
Fun Fact ATREUS is like TinTin now
And that lady and gentlemen is how you do it
Quebra tudo Cleiton
“BOY”
SAY NO TO CROSS GEN KIDS
I NEEEEDDDD ITTTTT
Thor better run away. Kratos is coming to hunt you.
BOI
Goes to play the last game cuz this is coming soon
Kratos got soft
I hope kratos beats Thor and takes his hammer
i hope the time of this game will be the same with RE2
Moleque chato ! Se ele morresse no início, Kratos se revoltaria e teríamos um verdadeiro GOW. E pensar que o temível espartano agora abaixa a cabeça para um frangote...
all i request is that Kratos still calls him "boy"  i wonder if they will explain what happened to their gear from the last game. the boy make sense since he grew up, but what about Kratos?
Like si llevas jugando desde el primer juego :), tremendas ganas de jugar al nuevo
Atreus ❤️‍🔥
This is sick!!!! I absolutely can not wait
WOW
That's it boys and girls, gotta get me a PS5
3 minutes of chills and goosebumps
Thank You Sony Playstation, Thank You Santa Monica Studio.
Meu filho vai jogar esse jogo em 2069
Finally some enemy variety.
I'm infarded
Is thor's voice who I think it is?  Josh Brolin? Thanos himself.  I can't wait for this game.
“I thought you’d be bigger.” Kratos to Tyr
BOY has become teen boy
Atreus: "Start thinking like a general!" Kratos: "How about... no, Boy!" (ala Dr. Evil)
Boi: Tell me about your past. Kratos: Ever heard of Greece? Boi: No Kratos:Exactly.
They need to add new weapons. I mean blades of chaos and axe are main stay. But they need to add another weapon. Why not somehow bring blade of Olympus to stop ragnarok and defeat Thor?
It should be better than the MCU's Thor Ragnarok..
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father for a moment, start thinking like a general." Kratos: "Then start acting like a soldier and stop being a whiny bratty crybaby!"
Who tf dislikes this?  Bots?
Já esperava ❤️❤️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
I hope we can play as the son at some point and time
Wow this game is so angry 💥👍
And i still dont have a ps5
Coño tendré que vender un riñon
When the trailer plays in 1440p but the PS5 doesn't :/
👎
Last time Kratos was thinking like a General he slaughtered his family
Let's kill Odin instead of Zeus right now 😎👌
Thor boss fight gonna Be Epic cs Thor Odin Tyr etc are way stronger than greek Gods  So well see mad things Kratos can do
Amped
LOVE FROM ALGERIA <3  نبغييييك ربك
Thor - Are you a calm and reasonable person  Kratos - Go ask Zeus
We just gonna ignore the 2 wolves pulling Kratos' sled ?
Awesome
Ah! Mikael Åkerfeldt as Tyr. Nice.
That kid was draining for me . So no thanks
ACT LIKE A GENERAL AND SAVE SOME TIME
This has kingdom hearts 2 intro song vibes
mau posso esperar para craquear esse jogo no meu pc com windows 7 4gb de ram pentium 775 e uma gtx 550 ti
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Thanos: I am inevitable.
Amazing opening scene, it shows so much in a second. Previously Kratos teached the boy to hunt deer, and now we see his growing.
Auto pre-order activated beezzzzt beep Bop 🍻
Yesss, my body is ready 😭😭😭
Ps4 grafics
I think im forgetting/missing something, isn't Freya cursed by odin? She can't hurt anyone by magic or blade yet she's attacking Kratos here Desperation or pure anger maybe?
Mimir is one badass than celibrimbor
Finally they took out the second part 🤩
I’m extremely excited for Ragnorak😁
VALHALLA I have immediate ptsd
Pra ps4 2022 qual data?
BADASS
Well not selling my playstation anymore (hope it's compatible with PS4)
I love how at 0:21 they make Atreus’ entrance allude to him wearing Loki’s headpiece.
Pls be well optimized and not broken on the ps4
PLEASE IM SO EXCITED!!!!
BOY FINNA HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?!?
Mimir wasn't joking when he called Thor "Fat Dobber" 😂
Def one of the best trailers I’ve seen in years
Dude Tyr is huge
0:22 loki in the making, Atreus will using deer's skull as his helm
For those who know how to read runes. The runes also read ragnarok...so cool
Been watching this on repeat, love this trailer 🤩🤩😍😍
So this only available on ps5 or all Sony platforms
Yo im waitin for this
Kratos: Are you coming with us? Tyr: ...What took you so long?
O ragnarok está chegando
KRATOS DIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person  Kratos: Nah, but don’t worry 😐
Mother of the world serpent, will kratos approve?  If he's thinking like a father than the answers No, and as a general well maybe.
Watch mimir be Tyr.
Whose the chick
This is what I strive for
Lets goooo
2:50 awesome
For some reason that headless dude kind of sounds like jacksepticeye
The dislikes are Xbox fans
Lil boy wouldn't have even TRIED to tell Kratos to "start thinking like a general" line if he REALLY knew why and how he got those chains
Boy, what an awesome trailer!
Already a 9/10, glad they’re giving more attention to the blades, kinda felt like an afterthought in 4, no I’m not calling it 2018 since it’s a continuation of 3, and that’s what they should’ve call it, just makes things more complicated, anyway cool trailer
HYPEHYPEHYPE
Can you play it on PC?
But why did they make Thor fat?
Trying to figure out where this black girl at the end will come into play. her clothing, jewelry and gold tattoos seem Norse but obviously she's not native Scandinavian... I want to think she's going to be used to introduce the Egyptian mythology they teased a lot on the previous game. Thoughts?
Sii
Intro to Egyptian gods at the end?
La pregunta es de que playa es?
🔥🔥🔥
:)
anyone realize how kratos was literally staring at us at the begining or is it just me?
Wow. Can't wait to play it!🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS LIT I CANT WAIT FOR IT 😭
Lets see how Kratos handles a teenage BOY!!!
"Garoto"!!!!
Aww Boi is growing up and who is that at the end ?
Is YISUUUS!!
Anyone else can't help but marvel at the beast flying towards Kratos at 2:21 ...No? Just me? I can't wait to play that encounter and the many others it looks like we'll be treated to
I am flying to Japan and if you get me a PlayStation five
I'm glad I stopped playing after GoWIII.
Awesome ! Now I need to go on another epic quest to find a ps5 !
If they start Ragnarok, maybe Kratos is Surtur?!
Anyone else want Aretus/Loki to be a playable character?
tyr better hope he doesn’t get hercules treatment
I agree with kratos, you should always consider peace above war
Loki and Angrboda gonna make some babies, Fenrir
1:48 Boy, the last time I thought I was a general, there are problems xd
CHAD
Deammmmmmm
*Entons Kratos va pelear con Thor si o no?*
Quiero la PS4 :'-)
I didn’t get any answers from this trailer.
Kratos is so OP he makes Tyr and any giant look small!  Can’t wait..
This has Potential to be one of the Greatest Series of All Time.
I guess we already know what game of the year for 2022 is going to be.
Придется покупать пс5
It's official, im getting a  PS5.
Why his voice change lol
"you'll get your answers soon enough... well some of them"  this series is going to be a long one and i am totally fine with this train ride LET'S GOOOOO!!!
Every single Xbox player: Saddle up boys, time to switch providers
If Kratos starts thinking like  general again the boy will wish he hadn't said that
Kratos still refuses to revert to the wrathful, quick to act, and brutal person he was once. That path led him to accidentally kill his family, and wage war against the Olympian Gods. He's also hesitant to fulfill this journey for he knows it means it will end the time he has with his son. Oof. I can't wait.
There is a bug in 1:35. Axe get in blades. How nobody saw that.
Kratos: WHAT HAPPENED HERE BOI Boi: NOTHING, IT JUST HAPPENED  Both Kratos and boi looks to Angrboda and the wolves Kratos: …. Boi, did you saw “that” Atreus: You mean the O, yes, why? Kratos: I’m so proud of you.
Did that girl in the end come straight from Wakanda ?
Calm and reasonable.   Yeah, right.
you create a game about Scandinavian mythology, not about Egyptian, your tolerance is ruined,fack you sony,I am disappointed(
PS4?
More and more I see that the Great Replacement is real thing.
does anybody know the setting of the warmer climate they were breifly in the trailer ?? and might it explain the dark skin girl? or was that just forced representation?
Thor "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos "Ask Baldur oh wait..."
Why would he married this African-Korean girl? I only dislike cuz of that.
Does thor voiced by Josh Brolin?
It’s been awhile since I’ve been so hyped for a game. Looks great
I need a PS5 already.
Que alguien me compre la ps5 dale ni la 4 pude :(
Boooooy , hunt deer !
Tyr looks AWESOME! And who is that new character at the end? I love her already 😍
Best ps game ever ❤️🔥
with greek and norse mythology this game has unlimited material to pull from. Just  bummed it wont come out this year.
The real thor is an alcoholic man so the result that he is fat by it, is not like the thor of avengers that is strong, i thinl they did a great job with the form of thor, only muscles
UAU!
This looks like a PS4 game
I'll wait for the ps5 with kratos theme to buy
Quality looks the same as PS4. :/
YYYYYEEEEESSSSS!!!!!! I just hope it isn’t soaking with political pressure. Please don’t ruin this.
Shut up and just take my money💰 , put the pre-order out.
Yoooooo!!! Haven't been this hype for a game since gta 5!
Broooo wtfdffffddd 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
It looks kinda like monster hunter
Oooh me vengo
Aaaaaa
Who is the last one, with bright eyes?
Calling it right now, tyr is going to stab us in the back
I'm glad atreus' voice is deeper. Something about it always got on my nerves in the original game.
I like the symbolism of Loki walking in with a silhouette with antlers
A lot of the combat looks the same i hope they put a few more different combos otherwise im finna buss
And that's why i will buy ps5
0:20 I love how the deer horns mimick Loki's spikey helmet, really cool intro and foreshadowing ^^
I thought thors voice sounded familiar
GOW4dlc ?
Anyone at 1:50 see Atreus putting in work in the background?
referecie patapon pls next game
Wow I’m so happy right now ; Thor fight happening, odin confirmed , try still has both hands meaning fenrir? Freya v kratos, confirmed that all 9 realms will be visitable including Asgard , this game will be the best of 2022 by far can’t wait
2021
i. Am. HYPER. *VENTILATING!!!!!!*
I'm excited but sad that Opie from SOA is going to have his head smashed in twice
🤩🤩🤩🤔😢.
2:06 - well… i’m wet
yessssss
WE
Is this the PS4 Pro version?
You know that?  Atreus is 5.9 +- feet long here?  He is 14 years old here in Ragnarok(giant gens) So his height is like an adult human male… 👌🏼👌🏼 great work!
Resident evil 4 is better than this copy.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Indeed.
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person"? Kratos: "Ask Helios"
That just looked amazing and  i can't wait to get it
I can't believe it's been 3 years already
EEEEHEEHHEEHEHEHEE MAIS UM JOGO PRA NOIS THE MF XDDDDDDDD
Boi is no longer BOI
2:51  WHOA...DAME!
Can't wait to play this amazing games and fight Monsters , Music reminded me of the Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies
my boi got big
👑
who's the girl at the end?
Old graphics
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love how far Kratos has come. In no other game someone could ever even imagine telling him to "Stop acting like a father". He's really evolved
Is this a dlc?
Did kratos voice get even deeper??
Imagine what the old Norse would think of this trailer.
Is it me or Thor has been replaced by Thanos...?                  Messing with you guys, but the voice actor sounds like Josh Brolin.
No aguarde 🤭🤭🤭
That pubert boi
PS4
Salvage
Will you ever give the game put on pc...it'll increase your sales by like a lot
As soon as you hear that choral chant theme you know it’s on. Yeahhhhhhhhh! It’s on!!!!!!!!
درود بر کریتوس کبیر
3:04 Who's that?
Que pena que não vai sair Para o ps4
WOKE
When Atreus walked in I thought he was wearing a dear skull
i see the girl from the polar express has made an appearance
Thor - "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos two seconds late - "You should’ve gone for the head"
Ps4?? :(
B…… b…….. b……….. chills muda effers  Hype train 🚂 toot toot alllllll aboard !!!!!!!!!
Don’t waste any more hours of your life friends. Gaming has gotten me nowhere. It will get you the same. You probably won’t believe me now  but you will one day.  When it’s to late.  The more you play, the more you will want to play. But the less you will enjoy it.  Don’t make my mistakes
Does anyone here besides me here thinks that girl at the end will be a love interest for Atreus?
Me vuelvo locooooo
This looks like it might be a proper sequel.
Kratos is gonna lift Thor’s hammer, BET!
Thor “ you seem like a calm and reasonable person”   Next scene shows kratos setting explosive fire to a dude with the blades of Athena XD
The music just gives chills.
Top , acabei de comprar
Please put some extra cool boss fights in New Game+ mode!
Weeeee need more weapons pls the game was so stale after I did the same combo ten billion times the game was fantastic but I missed the cool weapons we got in old games
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "LS+RS"
Thor: " Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: L3+R3
Praying Tyr lives up to his legend and becomes and ally and hasn’t gone mad from all his time imprisoned
Porfavor saquen lo en ps4 te lo pido PlayStation
Dlccccccccccccccccccccccccc
Ugh this is a masterpiece and if I could hang it on a wall I would. I can’t, so I just watch it, every chance I get.✌️👑 --And What a Perfect Way to Start the Day.--💃😀
I’m having theory that Angrboda(teenage girl same age as Atreus) is from Egypt, consindering she has brown skin.  And she might marry with Atreus and move to Egypt.
A black character in a game about Norse mythology? I'll pass and let your soulless NPC idiot customer base pay for such a game. It is funny how whites are accused of cultural appropriation while blacks and their leftist supports are guilty of that, all day and every day. I noticed that there are no blacks in Ghost of Tsushima. Well, we all know that there are no blacks in that game because it is a game about a non-white, non-European culture. Ancient White culture? Have to blackwash at least one character.
WHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa you guys are on it this year
im glad this is just the same as the last one, it means i don't have to buy a playstation 5
BOYYYYY
ahh another loki variant
I'm ready for enjoying more fatherhood experience
Sem português sem nem oque eles falou  kkkkkkkk será que o acento faz falta )ķkkkkkkkkkk
"WAR IS NOT THE ONLY WAY" The Legends Tyr and Kratos🔥
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "Leave." "My." "Home."
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Every surviving Greek out there: "Its gonna happen again... It will happen again.. It will happen again.."
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Kratos: “And I took that personally”
Top
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" The Greek Pantheon including the Titans:  awkward whistling
THOR: Are you a calm and reasonable person KRATOS: Just wait until this red meter fills up
Even though it's a year off, just by technicality the release date between 2018 GoW and Ragnarok was nearly three years. exactly the same amount of time as Fimbulwinter, the prelude to the end times of the Norse Pantheon
"War isn't the only way"  The Greek gods: yeah, about that....
I like how PlayStation is competing with itself for game of the year with all these games coming out
Not a single troll boss in sight. This game is an immediate improvement.
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"  OH BOY, WHAT A QUOTE
is the a dlc type game spiderman MM or a stand alone
Уже не интересно , думал будет что то новое,  в Russia вот это интересно
LEGENDARY 🔥👑
Why is this only exclusive to ps5
YEAH BABBY!!!
Never got the motivation to play part one to the end. Too much stupid puzzles and collect stuff. Loved part 1 and 2 one my ps2.
la pibita del final me debería de importar? que trailer meh
❤️
Oh... BOI
Alright now GoW 5 and Horizon 2 check, I only need the following titles to be announced next :  The Witcher 4 Uncharted 5 Shadow of the colossus 2
AC valhalla, now GOW Ragnarok.......Norse mythology fans are going crazy 😂
Wait....... wasn't that Calliope at the end? How?!
O Thor ficou Horrivel kk
Hasta que por fin :")
finally more enemy variation 😩😩😩
ps4?
Kratos and Tyr vs Odin and Thor.   It’s going to be a bloodbath
Yo where’s the release date ???
❤
STOP ADDING BLACK PEOPLE IN RANDOM VIDEOGAMES  NORSE MYTHOLOGY >>> BLACK GIRL??? HOW??
Que isso óia eu lá fiquei mais bonito e gostoso 😎
I hope we get to kill Atreus at some point.
Thor i see yoooouuu 🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🥸
I’m just glad my boy Mimir is back and adjusted to the family life.
LITERALLY LESS THEN A WEEK AFTER I FINISH THE GAME
The best part is that most of the gameplay looks like actual stuff you can do. The combat is about to go through an entire evolution!
I like how politic goes over videogames and movies... this girl in the end of trailer has no sense for a trailer at all but she's black, that's how stuff works now... I have nothing against black ppl but how do they relate to nordic myrhology? I don't get it, really... How do they relate to Lord of The rings? The Witcher?  new upcoming Game of Throness spin-off? They don't. I think nothing wrong that we have different cultures in this life and we need to respect that. Hello from Chernobil <3 Love to everyone  - you should respect different cultures, Sony.
i need to stop watching this over and over yet here i still am
Omfg YESSS
Thor doesn't sound too intimidating
“TEEN!”
How many Trolls did you put in the game this time? Santa Monica:
خاک تو سرت با این بازی ساختنت
1 more game to convince me to get a ps5😭
I love how they foreshadowed Atreus in the beginning as Loki.
So...who is that girl in the end of the trailer? And why do I get the feeling that she's Faye for some reason?
Finally!
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Me looking back to GoW3 - "Well he is now..."
Uhh so do they go to Newfoundland? That girl at the end has to be native ‘cause Norse people don’t get that dark.
Is this game would be available for PS4?.
I thought Týr would be bigger, but he's definitely the one.
Siiiiiiiii
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person.  Kratos: ATHENA!!   Can you believe this guy?
Love how atreus stands up to his father to help him now he's older.
EU TE AMO CLEITON
2:16 Kratos is Worthy!
Don’t tell me it’s not coming on ps4 ?
My guy got older but kratos I'm a lil tired of him he just grew a longer beared
Tyr towering above Kratos Kratos: Hmm i fought Bigger
AAAAAA KRATOS AAAAA  SE REVENTARA A LOS DIOSES XDDDDDDD NICEEEEE 😪😪😪😪😪👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
webos
Naaaaah Atreus hit puberty
All I gotta say is sad that we have to wait so long .
I’m boutta bust 😩
This is zeus ?
Prostagma?!
I’ve watched this trailer 20 times and still get goosebumps
The ragnarok will start after they find tyr
Meu ovo.
Neeeeeeed it ! 💯
It has come may you all survive till this master piece graces our souls with its supreme gameplay and storytelling
Lessgooo cant wait!
Looks like the old tradition of losing all his upgrades continues.
Boy!
Kratos: "Are you coming with us." Tyr: " *Yes, boi* "
I hope they let you start with the same stuff you finished GOW with.
Brutal... Epico.... Legendario....!!!  estaba añorando este momento..., solo falta ver como kratos es el causante del Ragnarok en asgard.. Ragnarok = Kratos = Destruccion de Asgard.  I Love SantaMonicaStudios, I love.
This game is going to be the best thing that happened it's year!!!
"How's it feel to live long enough to see your favorite franchises go down in flames?"    "Feels great"   Sadge
That tall guy look familiar....who is he at the end? Can someone tell me?
Kratos: *’Sees Angrboda’* Boy, It’s time I taught you.  Atreus: What do you want to teach me, Father?  Kratos: Listen closely, boy. It’s X, X, O, ↪️, 🔁.
why do i dislike Atreus more now
Kratos' son grew up quite a bit
Oh wow! I must be in 2017 cause this looks like it’s for meant for a PS4😑😑😑
They showed much beautiful gameplay that this makes me feel that in Fall 2022, Ragnrok will be here.   ( cues up Led Zepplin's Immigrant Song )
CHOREI
Remember, don't pre-order. They aren't going to run out of copies. And maybe you know you're going to buy it no matter what reviews say. But the more companies see us preordering the more they'll think it's ok to skimp and sell unfinished products. Buy it the day, he'll the minute it comes out. But not a second before.
Atreus girlfriend
When is this game coming out?
I forgot dark skinned people are in every nation mythology now. Have absolutely no problem with races, but it is so cool to play/watch different nations' mythology with authentic representation.
Oh amazing, they found a black female to squeeze into a Norse mythology game... Yay
QUE DELICIA CARA
How is the wife of Loki a black woman?
Press X to not jump
чёт атрей поплохел
No puedo esperar para jugarlo en mi ps5👍🏽👍🏽😍😍
Let's Gooo!!!
They just had to ruin it all with those last few seconds...
Отличный сервис. Они помогают в продвижении каналов YouTube, а главное, весь просмотр происходит в режиме реального времени. Цена нормальная.
All I can notice on tyr is how similar his face is to kratos and it just makes me wonder if tyr is actually the future atreus
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: well yes but actually no
MIMIR'S BACK BAYBEEEEEE
1:50 focus on Atreus .... thank me later....
Yoooooooooooooooooooooo
I can’t wait any longer already it’s killing me I need it now
BUENARDO
Black Angrboda????🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
wait why is atreus trying to find out who loki is
BOY
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Legendary ❤️❤️
Chills at 2:07
Thor in ragnarok? More like Bore ragnarok
The soundtrack of this trailer is awesome! Congrats to mr. Bear McCreary!
not really next gen is it. dissapointing
The only reason I would ever consider buying the so called "Next-gen" console. BTW, get this out on PC and find out how far superior the graphics can be.
Really wanted to see ragnarök
GREATNESS IS COMING.. 👑
I have no words to describe how I squealed and shook through the whole video. I’ve truly never been more excited for a game in my life.
Will it be on ps4 too
KLAITÃO E O GAROTO OS BOM DE GUERRA
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: L3+R3
i need it
Could have been perfect, but they had to pander and make a norse mytholgy, african... Its not so much about the fact she looks african, I know they made her look that way to pander for diversity sake and it taints the game. Its better when you have characthers look as authentic as possible. For one I would not like if they encounter African mytholgy and made Anansi anything but african looking.
*Tyr rises over kratos* Kratos: Trust me pal, you're not that guy. Ask Cronos
Hmmm an whats New? The same Graphic
Well let me guess not on ps4 r8
whats this? a ps5 game with ps4 graphics? is a new game or a DLC for the ps4 version? you sony are evil and lazy...only for 80 dlls, bravo sony, you really loves your fans...or their money....
the legnd is back😭😭
dyel tyr
All Indians withing 💥💥💥
Who the little black girl at the end??  Edit:  Found it was Angrbroda which according to Norse Myth is Loki’s mate who helps Birth Fenrir, Jormungandr, & Hél (possibly). So yeah… Atreus likes chocolate 🍫 😭😭🙏🏽💯
oh wow
Am I the only one who hears Josh Brolin's voice in this trailer around 2:09, I know it's not him but it sounds extremely familiar
AAAAAAA QUE MARAVILHA 🧡
I deeply regret not having watched the stream... THIS IS FCKING DOPE!!!! ❤❤❤😭😭😭
شيخ قبيله قحطان
Why is Angrboda black? This is literally a nordic setting.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
I might genuinely cry the moment Kratos stops calling him ‘Boy’ once he’s older.
looks pretty much the same as GOW4, not sure how to feel.....
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonble person ?" Kratos: "I dont wanna fight you brother" Hercules: "They Sent Me To Find An Apple".... Button Smash"
i hope they give more enemy varieties in this one. Last game's enemy types were repetitive, bosses included.
پرچم ایران بالا💪💪💪💪
Ahahahahahahahahahag 👉👈
Can’t wait to see it in person!
Týr is Savathún! Be warned!
No puedo esperar más
nice game 😎😍😍😍😍ragnarok now
Vamos!
yess
The best
I love how Atreus gets the deer without help now lol
GOW 4 : It's all about maturity, responsibility, and not giving into anger and violence  Gow 5 : SIKE, LET'S GO BERSERK
@theradbrad DUUUUDDDDE!
Game of the year 2022!!
Kratos now shares with more characters. I do miss the solo character he was. More kids I see 🤣
I love you KRATOS
AMAZING
Waw wonderful
Dou
Do NOT sell yours PS4 yet...
Black people in Asgard?
Ngl this looks like nordic themed animal crossing
Thor loool
Boy!
Looks more like a DLC than new game. Bit disappointing.
So this was still made for a system that's more than ten years old? How will they make these games next gen when they're stuck catering to ten year old tech?
Muito daora show de bola 😀👍perfeito e simplesmente divertido
Kratus maqdooni🇲🇰
soy of war
1:54 The absolute WRONG thing to say to Kratos.
I’ll wait until it’s $5
Will it be on Ps4 or it Ps5 only
Yah 😍
the reason What makes Xbox fans crying
bruh i swear with the current scalping prices for playstation 5s i literally have to watch someone play this game SMH :(
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general"  *Kratos has PTSD in 250x speed*  "NO"
ننتظرها بفارغ الصبر
Cory Barlog 🥺
I AM SO,EXCITED
Ok now I need a PS5.....
Dear Sony. This game looks great but did you really have to show Tyr in order to sell more copies of it? I mean wouldn't it be better to leave as a surprise in the game?
Omgggggggggt
Sinceramente no me impresiono mucho
Another epic moment with Kratos oh man I can’t wait to play this game. Please give us much more epic boss fight please Santa Monica Devs rather than just giant trolls  please.
I am finally happy...
3:02 caliope?
So excited
Ehmmmmm, anything new?
💪❤️❤️❤️
Atreus is becoming a man. DAD OF BOI RETURNS
Cleitão continua foda
Dlc
Can anyone tell me when is the release date? And please tell me its for ps4
Less go
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
A BLACK woman in NORDIC mythology???? An obese Thor? What now, Odin will be an ansian guy?
That General line really hit hard...
Зачет
GOW 4 dlc... por desgracia eso parece
YEAH BOIII
Se me hace agua la cola
It’d be so cool if we got our hands on Mjolnir
I think Tyr will be Jormungandr
just crazy! 10/10 this gonna be huge
This game lacks some gore.
Do we continue with gow4 equipment or fresh new start?
Oh boy.
“Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general” Kratos: boy I spent 3 games and several spin offs learning why that’s a bad idea
Loki variant
tops 😎
RIP XBOX
I'm so excited for this game!
Finally we got to see tyr
qĺAqqQ R  Aquino
Already G.O.T.Y !
My eyeeees
No release date !? 😭
Kratos: are you coming with use? Tyr:(stands) Kratos: your big. Fought bigger.
Black Girl at the end? A teaser for the Egyptian Pantheon?
le vamos a partir la madre a Xbox
Okay Tyr's clothing brings the Jotunn mural to light about who Loki is holding. Hmmmmm exciting.
Why is there a poc in here?
Я восхищен. Жду.
Sério que vai acabar esta mitologia neste jogo ??? 😭… Kleitão tô ansioso pelo Ragnarok!!!! 🥰
Boss fights I want but will probably NOT get list. Feel free to add to the list Surtur Fenrir Heimdal Odin
woowwwwwwwwww
Another Pantheon ready to be erased
Y'all Angrboda is why I am sooooo hyped with this trailer!!!
Заебись Чё...
This feels a lot more expansive and adventurous, you can feel it in the soundtrack too. I love it so much c':
Lo espero con entusiasmo
Everything is just amazing, the game looks great, but the ending... Why Santa monica studio? Why did you do that?
Ryan Hurst as thor loving it might  help  He's career like judge with the voice acting.  combat looks godly  can't wait
Esse jogo só tem um defeito: é um exclusivo...
So hyped for this game!!!!
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos - L3+R3
Kratos learned some tricks from Sekiro
Atreus has grown up
Lord, our father, Thank you for Kratos 🙏
Epic! Epic! Epic!
Do we now say "Boi" Or "Teen"?
Nobody is mentioning the centaur
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?  (Red circle appears above his head)  Kratos: yes
I love how the video ends with "you'll get your answers soon enough"
o bom da guerra
Not enough blood
Umarım güzel oyun olur
Да, да, древние германцы были чернокожими азиатами.
We need old kratos
I don't want to be that guy....but they revealed wayyyyy to much. I mean I'm happy but cmon guys?  I would have liked to find out Tyr was alive through playing the game.
Единственная игра оправдывающая ps5
The game seems soo cool,i hope it will be on ps4,it will be amazing go be on ps4 too
Kratos is still the DILF that we all used to know. He ages gracefully like Freya. I wish we could still see the flying adorable Atreus.
so is the Boi using different voice or the same voice actor enter puberty too
DLC Ragnarok
NO!!
Boy turning into MEN
топ
So is no one gonna talk about how Mimir is painting with his mouth?
KRATOS 4L
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa😭🥳
Where is it Hela ?
EU TE AMO KRATOS ! OBS:  CADE A HELA ?
guys who noticed the wolves really know whats coming !!
I love the music so much
I can only imagine how hormone filled boy is gonna act when he doesn’t agree with Kratos😂
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Kratos: "Ayo, Athena, is that a rhetorical question?"
2:00 Thor sounds so menacing, unhinged. In this universe, he's basically the devil and the Norse God's most powerful weapon.
My question is why is Cory Barlog not the lead for the game , has me kinda worried they didn’t see his vision for the next game
Tyr: Walks toward Kratos Kratos: You are big. I've fought bigger.
Prince of Persia more interesting
Please don't release it before i get my ps5. Still waiting to get retail price.
I have to keep reminding myself Kratos is a spartan
HOLY MOTHER FINALLY
In the key art showing the characters Tyr is holding his left arm…… he already knows what’s going to happen haha
What about Egyptian gods???!?
Sony: Ragnarok is coming. Atreus: We wanna stop Ragnarok. Cory: Never heard of it.
If you notice, kratos seems much better than the last game, maybe its because he is fighting again. Its like he is gaining his green orbs back.
Black nordic girl. Gj sony
🥺🧡
Will this be a ps5 exclusive?
GOW is a prime example of how you have to keep up with the times in order to be successful, but also you dont need to comprise the quality of your craft in order to keep up with trends
Wow. ¡It's incredible!
30fps??
1:18 is that zeus statue ? 🤔
Atreus is all grown up. LET'S GOOOO!!!!
Thor:he is not your father .......  Athereus:
Это обычная графика на ПК. Чему они радуются?
que hernoso kratosssssss lo quiero jugar ya solo espero que en mi ps4 fat se vea bien
Old grafic
Glad to know there is people alive hahah , couldn`t help wondering what had happened to everone.
Ps4?
Vamoooo lo pibes sale nuevo gordo war
So hyped but the game mechanics look so similar :/
But... but it looks exactly the same
1:55 Is the only cut scene where kratos doesn't have Blade of Chaos ....  Not sure If any one else noticed this .. but this looks interesting ...
🔥🔥
Мужчины не плачут , не плачут , но я не смог сдержать слез , извините
All the 3k dislikes are the Xbox players 🤣
2:53 How girls see men’s heights: 6ft vs 5ft12
its nice to have at least one game that has diversity, representation and inclusivity.
KRATOS TE COMO LA V AAAAAA YA QUIERO QUE SALGAAAAAA
PlayStation only? Or PC too..🤔
Mimirr
GOTY in 2022!!
Will it be available for Sony 4?
Это просто охеренно!!!
I just came watching this
looks cool
Angaroboda? 3:05
This is so epic!!!
Si lees esto Grefg, mira tu casa en TortilaLand xDDDD
What a joke.
yea xbox is DONE!
Why am I getting the feel that the girl at the way end is somehow related to Calliope ? …
I love it when the notification shows up, "someone likes your comment" and "You have a new subscriber"🥺🥺🥺❤️
Am I the only one who noticed how similar that looks to a light elf? 2:28
Look at my Boy Atreus!!!
Don't have a PlayStation
1:54 Never remind Kratos of his past BOY!
Yea lets come out with games for the 10 people who has the ps5
I’m coming from the future to say it “this game is a masterpiece.“
are those wolfs mani and sol (probably not) but cool to think about
Boi is becoming Man, albeit rather slowly.
We need a Voluspå soundtrack in GoW5.
💪
Sköll and Hati foreshadowing in 0:42? 🧐
So there was black people in Nordic mythology?
"NO!"
*Certavi et vici*
Game of the year 10/10 masterpiece
How Can i play this game without buying a ps5 ffsake
Ragnarok is coming and so are all of us 😂
Very nice 👍🏽
❄️🤩
👍👍💐
PS4 compatibility is this title disability. Wings of nextgen-inovation are severely clipped. :(
"You seem like a calm reasonable person" Trust me Thor, he is not.
Angrboda is very beauty <3
te amamos cory barlog :)
I would love to see the return of Blades of Olympus. It would be amazing to watch swinging in the hands of Tyr XD
It feel illegal to see Kratos wearing a shirt
Now make more PS5’s
Локи-бог обмана, бог способный обмануть саму судьбу, так что в их с батей путешествиях, реалиях, и приключениях они добьются идеального становления локи как самого могущественного бога.....скорее бы порубиться
hype!!!!!
The opening scene gives us nostalgia to when Kratos was helping the boy hunt. Now he has the ability to hunt byhimself. Only to foreshadow His journey will go forth byhimself at the end of this game.
"PLAY Has No Limits"... Except the f*cking platform!!!
The Alföðr demands it
Boom fire 💥💥💥👍👍👍
Será que a Santa Monica Studio vai ser mais um estúdio que vai cair por está se aliando ao politicamente correto em vez de fazer jogos para aqueles que verdadeiramente lhes asseguraram o sucesso?
Legendary!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😎
I Wonder Who Cuts Atreus' Hair.. Cuz It's Perfectly Well Done...
Release it for pc, not everyone has ps5 not in stock still.
I have the feeling that they r going to kill Kratos in this Game... Just saying !
Boy?
رهيبب😭🔥🔥🔥
the giant realm and finding TYR
Game of the year guaranteed and it hasn't even came out yet 🔥 Also can't wait to see the two GOW's from Norse and Greek mythology working together
So we just going to ignore loky/athres has the power to ride his magic animal like that was epic he just shot whit his bow on the ground and then it appeared and starts riding it
Me encanta, el trailer del GOW del 2018 empieza si no mal recuerdo cuando atreus aprende a cazar y en este ya lo trae el solo xd
Where is next gen?
Я ждал...не зря
О да,Кратос мы тебя ждём!
Dmt.boy watching maybe this trailer 1000times and cant belive itis really happening cant wait to get hands again on kratos with ps5💪💪
Freya’s back 😍
the boy has grown
Atreus grew up🥺🔥🔥🔥
- Thor : are you a calm and reasonable person ? - "No" Kratos answered calmly.
The blades of chaos.  My ooooooooo
Sacalo para PS4 paaaa
so bois i think we have our goty
This game is art.
THE BLADES OF CHAOS ❤🔥
Come ooooooon
Boi
Poor Kratos he just wants a peaceful life with his son 💔
Sony: ragnarok is coming  Atreus: we wanna stop ragnarok  Cory barlog: am i a joke to you?!!!
“Are you calm person?”   “yes, “replied Dumbledore, respectfully
لوز
Is that loki in the thumbnail behind kratos? Oh no my bad that's just atreus    😉
I feel like Atreus is going into his own phase like a teenager who wants to find purpose in life.
Is it just me or did someone notice the Leviathan Axe kinda looks small,pale and compact compared to the behemoth badass of 2018?
اله الحرب كريتوس 😍😍😍😍👌🏻
In 3 minutes, I came more more times than 30 years marriage
Hear me out, pc too?
OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG !!!!!!!OMFG !!!!!!!!
Vai sair pro PS4??
only PS5????
Wielding fire with the chaos blades and ice with the axe. Just IMAGINE for a second what kind of mayhem is to be had wielding Mjolnir. Its just a hope. But that would be dope af.
Kkkkkkkk, dlc do gow 4 dps dessa eu vo ate compra um xbox, nem fudendo que eu vo paga 400 conto em uma dlc.
Everybody calm and reasonable till a ⭕ starts hanging on their head.
perfeccion
Muito bao
Saldrá para PS4?
If I wanted to see a chimp I'd to the zoo. I'm passing on this one.
This is the greatest birthday gift ever!!!
It's like Kratos is trying to avoid the unavoidable
yep.. N in the game about ragnarok
Nadam se da ce izaći i za ps4
Big W from PlayStation droping all heat
starting to think starbomb was onto something
xbox betur. ps2 cant evem run xbox connect
Solo va a salir para PS5?
Ah the classic exclusive that rips Xbox in every generation of consoles...
The old GoW was the best. This kid is just a annoying liability.
more fun smvr fans!!
А это что у нас тут за загорелая скандинавочка?
Wowwwwwwww
I absolutely love this
let sgoooooooooooooooooooo
Thor: Look what they have to do, to mimick a fraction of my power
Every game has ragnarok in it now
Boysss any news on the release date??
The best ever
I will buy a ps5 just for this game
IM FANGIRLING SO HARD RIGHT NOWWW
i got to go change my pants.
Some MCU fanboys take a look at Thor's design and say the game steals from Endgame.   I've never felt so frustrated at people who never bother to take a deep dive into Norse mythology.
Pls launch this game on pc 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🎉🙏🎉🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
the main question is when
Sony you're are the best
Happy they kept the same kratos model from GOW4
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
... he hunted the deer
Whos the girl at the end? 🤔
Genial. Pero le sacaron el salto del 4. Y este nuevo es igual que el anterior.  En fin. Me gusta más el 1. 2 y 3.
kleiton
3k dislikes from Xbox Fanboys ?
Why only on PS5??? 🤬
В конце негра показали, все ок, можно запускать игру
Why no motion blur? The animations doesn’t look smooth without motion blur.
La definicion de epicidad
Ура!!!!!! Сколько ждал этого!
كريتوس يعود 😁😂😁
Odin: *exists* Kratos: ODIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
Fun fact: 90% of the comments are filled with " are you a calm or reasonable person ".
Give me 555 Mortal Kombat
WE GOT TYR BRUH
Is it coming for last gen consoles?
Is it come to ps4?
the boy and the thunder
boy

Is this on ps4 also pls ans
Yesssssssss
épico
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Me: Ok but when is the release date? The girl in the trailer: You'll get your answers soon enough. I see what you did there Playstation!
Yeah!
Seve epico, espero que aiga una tercera parte y esta no sea la ultima de la saga nordica como dicen :'3
They’re gonna cause ragnarok. It would be weird if they didn’t, it’s practically their job.
Как они зимой в мороз ходят в футболочках с коротким рукавом ?
This is exactly what I expected and wanted. The game takes the mechanic from the old game and expand on them. The world looks more alive then ever. This also confirms that Tyr is not Kratos.
Since this is the finale of the Norse Saga I really hope we get to go to the other realms. Svartalfheim looked to be one they did go to in trailer but hopefully we get to see Vanaheim too. Asgard is kinda a guarantee
Just goole it you can get answers
Santa Monica Studios never dissapoints
For the people thinking this is the be all end all for Norse mythology representation you couldn’t be more wrong.
I don’t like how Atreus looks in this game tbh! They could’ve done a better job
😮😮😮
Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!
0:24 killer instinct
Top TYR content right here 🪓
I hope kratos still calls atreus boi and not use his actual name
vai ser chato igual o primeiro
PC version Pls
i cry i cry i cry i cry
More of the same.
Finally
Ooooooooooooooooooajafadadafafaffafa
Thor : I know your a calm Person Kratos : you didn't not know everything boy.....
Lame Woke diversity at the end
Love the deer imagery with atreus and the loki horns
Yesss
YYYYYYYEEEEESSSSS🤩🤩🤩
Loki is from that movie loki thor's brother
Twister metal????????
I bet kratos got angry when boy said start thinking like a general because he was one once and it ended in the death of his family
Obra de arte... Só vem!
Please make it for ps4 too
😍
Is it going to be available also in PS4?
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I would really like a new feature where freya is constantly ambushing us trying to kill us during the gameplay. Like majima from yakuza
This looks like GoW 1.5.
Is it just exclusive to PS5? Please someone tell me it has PS4 version. Cos I will just cry...
ok, I buy ps5 for now!
wow
Boi
Já vou comprar na pré venda o CD 😍🤩
thor got some meat hooks
You know it's an epic moment when Kratos looks up to someone 2:50
My favorite character is back💪💪💪...💙💙💙💙
I will choose Norwegian voice over with English subtitles! Sorry but Vikings had a White voice.
GIMME
Graphics same as. Ps4
Did they recast the voice of Atreus? Doesn't sound like Sunny Suljic, but maybe its just puberty.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Yeah just ask your sons and Baldour and the greek pantheon and.....
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
LOL did they SERIOUSLY MAKE AngrBoda BLACK?
Wow
BOY DID SOMETHING
Ну конечно африкано-азиатская девочка, тренды хуле. А так очень качественно. уже хочу поиграть
Thor sounds familiar, who is that voice actor?
Looks so amazing <3
Yesssss
☺
خلوها مجانية بشرفكم
""When Garena have 1 reason to smile they giv😂😂😂😊es 100 reason to cry"""😂😂😂
it’s sad that Spider-Man 2 and wolverine are PS5 exclusives But at least Ragnarök will be on PS4 and PS5
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Me: (puts on red shirt) what you tryna get into? Why your hand up? 👊🏾
GAME OF THE YEAR BABYYYYY
Kratos boutta be thurd wheelin atrues and the girl 😂😂
I hope we can keep our progress in the old game. Like the witcher or smth. Also. I want tyr to be like  hephaustaus without the betreyal. Soe hyped also. SETTLEMENTS MAYBE????
How much  I'm looking forward to this game 😍
My body is ready, now all I have to do is get my hands on a ps5 that is not over priced.

End - 3:00
nice looks cool!1!
that little girl at the end ruined my hype kinda ruined the mood of the trailer all dark and powerful the. high pitched girl voice like come on,I hope shes not a main character
Are the wolves suppose to be skoll and Hati? One is black one is white. Hmmm 🤔
Are you telling me that Tyr is the Grenado Tornado?!
🔥🔥🔥
9500€ day one
❄❄❄
I wanna see Xbox past this
Epic!
Master Cleiton 😎
OK, so if tyr still has both hands and Fenrir son of loki is responsible for his amputation does that mean that "loki" will take it off or will they add a Fenrir character. maybe tyr will betray them and kill Kratos?
Boy.
Охренно. Но кто эта темнокожая? И если это в мидгарде то нахера?
ostia
create an update that allows us to use dualsense on ps4.  please sony.
Prepare yourselves!!!!!!
Крутая игра
wait when does it come out
GOOOSSSEEEBUUMMMPPPSSS 😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for not putting a release date on this
*THE RETURN OF KRATOS BOSS!!*
everything what sony make stands out but why can't they make Xperia to stand out.
Can't wait to see what it'll look on release. Can't wait for 2021
🔥🔥
Faz funcionar o controle do ps5 no ps4. Por favor Sony
3:06 that’s Vanaheim!
Should give a release date at least
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  "NO!"
Ayooo tyrrrr
This is the ragnarok the war for the gods
Tráiganme una presión que se me bajó la coca DIOOOOOOOOOOS CÓMO AMO A ESE HOMBREEE
Last scene is in vanaheim
Othaa Kola Maass eh..m😍😍😍💥💥
Ok, I’ma thinking that the girl at the end is Calliope…
The hype is godly
Cara,como pode ter gente falando mal desse treiler ? ta doido demais.
Don't eat me alive but wasn't Angrboda's appearance in norse mythology is a woman with ghostly pale skin and with narrow face like a serpent?
Tyr
Gotta go 570$-
I'd like the idea of being able to run into Freya at almost any time as a peripheral hinderance, whenever she's not the main enemy.
Mark my words, Ragnarok and the Blade of Olympus, it can’t just be a coincidence the two are linked by destiny.
GOTY 2022 CONFIRMED
Why graphics  looks last gen?
Looks more like a DLC
yeeeesssss
Krunk!!! Is it just me or does this  just look like an upgraded PS4 game? 🤔
Yoooooo can't wait 🔥✨🔥
Is someone else doing his voice now ? because if its that black person then he should quit over black guilt
BOY: Father, tell me about your past. KRATOS: Ever heard of Greece? BOY: No. KRATOS: Exactly.
Wow zendayaaaa
Btw who is the girl at the end? Is that Angraboda?
Mmyr its tyr
Let's go
“Are you a calm and reasonable Person” Kratos: Ayo you remind me of someone….
No Freakin Way!
I'm getting hyped up by this trailer🔥
бляяяяяяяяяяяяяяяяяяя
Man... Teal'c really doesn't want his B O I to fight literal gods.   I respect that 🍸🧐
Kratos is an absolute unit
KRATOS  one man enough ...
Artreusun bi seçim yapması gerekiyor ya tyr ile gidip aşkını kurtaracak ya da babasıyla kalacak tyri seçecek ve thor ile yapılan anlaşmayı bozacak sonrasında kratos tyri öldürecek ve oğlunu kurtarmak için bütün iskandinav tanrılaeının içinden geçecek
1:54 Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!  Krato's: *NO!*  *Kratos' Mind:* I once thought like one, and it cost my family their lives!
THOR!!, I hate the fact that THOR is probably going to be evil
Заебись 🔥🔥🔥
Let’s go
What kind of person gives dislike to it😢
2:55 when she introduces you to the guy friend she tells you not to worry about
Hope it comes out on fathers day that would be amazing
MAKE IT ON PCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC 😭
WOOWW
Offical??
A Great DLC for the 2018 Game.
Билив
Waiting for this game
Wow..wow..wow the beast come
Sony vagabunda
Every were black people, even in Norway where 9 months of the year is winter
Joyaaaaa 💙
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"  *OH BOY, WHAT A QUOTE*
Watched this trailer 50 times already,to excited for this
Wonderful ! ❤️
Is the last girl is from horizon zero dawn
Tyr: Alright Kratos lets get our Revenge.  Kratos: Its not Revenge its "Rage"
Thor - “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos - “Is that a red circle above your head?”
Почему в скандинавской мифологии присутствую темнокожие?
Espero no se tarden en sacar el tráiler en doblaje en español
Was boy now it’s HEY MAN 😅😂
Hype
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" The Greek Pantheon including the Titans:  *awkward whistling*
0:18 there he is, there's my boy loki with the horns
Lixo
So you guys think Fenrir is not born yet, or will he be also there because of time travel stuff?
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonble person ?" Zeus: "My face, smash the button"
In  moments of crisis,  panic is nothing; harness it,  let it serve you.   - kratos
Another franchise ruined by wokeness. Cringe.
Atreus: "I should be out there, finding out who I am, who Loki is!" Kratos (thinking): "If only you knew...".  We are in for a treat guys. A major treat... Can't wait!
I feel like this game is the only reason my country is still relevant to the world and it's still something to hold onto😂😂
Atreus giving me mad jaden smith vibes idk why
Atreus has grown
Why not show in 60fps? It makes me worry that this is in 30fps.
2:12 bifrost
Topezeira show
Thor : Are you calm and reasonable person? PS Controller: im not gonna like this part
no.....
WE
This is legendary!
All I want is Thors hammer
Someone tell me if Fenrir appears.
I'm not criying
the graphics insane 🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥
War. War never changes
I waiting for this🙄🙄
Cleiton
ну да, как же тут без чёрных в скандинавской мифологии
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
I can’t wait for Odin and Thor and fraya
А у меня пс5 нету буду как всегда ролики смотреть
When your trying to watch this in school: School internet: *no*
ليش ما راح تنزل على ps4
IM GONNA CRY
Atleast boi learned how to hunt
game launch date?
Sheeeesh
Poor Xbox, I had xbox 360 , and also Ps2, Ps4, and from play station 4 till now Xbox had no chance , and Ps5 seems amazing
Im gonna cry because gow is my most fav game but i dont have money to buy the ps5 and the game itself
So basically same thing as last time
Goty 2022
Why spider man got 5M view and Kratos only got 3M ? Let's pump these numbers
im so pumped for the next game
Super
OOOOOOOOOPPPPPPP mind blowing 🤯 I will get this game must
Tyr Main From Smite 👍🏻
Is this a DLC?
Fantastic
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "Leave." "My." "Home."
Who was in the end ?
Here's what's going to happen in the next couple of decades. The company or studio making this asinine useless game will cease to exist. The mother company (Sony) will either completely renounce this asinine violent game, or it will also cease to exist.  Those responsible for this game, such the one named Cory Barlog, will be held accountable adequately in front of the entire human species.  And those who play this game will get a really special surprise.
Kratos is changing & its so evident.. like you can see he doesn’t want to be the reason for another universe being destroyed yet it’s already happening wether he likes it or not
The third installment after reboot we'll most likely to see major graphical improvements keep in mind Ragnarok will be a cross-generational game
THOR: Are you a calm and reasonable person KRATOS: Just wait until this red meter fills up
Uiii olha a namoradinha do atreus
Es hermoso
Woke nonsense
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”Kratos: “And I took that personally”
THOR :are you a calm and reasonable person? KRATOS : go and ask Athena
I wonder if atreus is gonna learn more about his father to the point where he understands why he chooses not to try to go to war with asgard
LETS GOOO
Can't fxcking wait
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: *remembers Greek Pantheon*
So no full playable atreus? Shame.
Look like ps4
"B-O-Y"
I can't wait for this!
Tyr: el dios de la guerra de la mitología nórdica. Tanto Tyr como Kratos son dioses de la guerra, por lo que estos dos podrían trabajar juntos para luchar contra los dioses de Asgard.
Let's GOOOO!!!
Nice DLC
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyr has Egyptian hieroglyphs on his left arm. This means he's either been to Egypt or that Egypt is our next destination after the Norse saga. 🤯
Вы шутите, это правда? Я не сплю?
I really hate the new voice of the boy tbh, he sounds annoying and cringe
TOOOOOOOOP
I just came
THE BOI HAS GROWN!! He will now be known as Big Boi.
GOAT GAME
Tyr still got both hands fenrir better take one
KLEITIN DO MAL IS COMING
There the blade of Olympus?
Why only on ps5😔💔
BOI!!!! We have a new game!
Why does týr still have both arms
Ah yes an American at the end, great addition.
Soy el único que en Tyr vio a Poseidón (fisicamente) y a Heracles (Altura)?
Ninja theory = cool
Not a single troll boss in sight. This game is an immediate improvement.
Lets goooooooooo I can't wait this is gonna be legendary!
The only game Playstation has going for it.
LISAAA
ITS LITTTTT
Ninja theory is cool
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you calm and reasonable person?  Me: I BEG YOUR PARDON?
It's British video games time (Dante)
AMIZING
It's British video games time
So nobody's gonna talk about the fact that Bwoy can hunt deer alone now. Oh okay...just me I guess.
YES
Cant wait!!!!
All those dislikes are toxic gow fans
оставили всё как прежде и добавили что то новенькое, чего ожидать!...
Mannnn i can not wait!
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
Это что, первое продолжение, в котром Кратос не теряет своё оружие!? Но ведь так не бывает!
The dislikes are from X-BOX owners
Looking at the graphics, this one will surely be released on PS4 also and the next one will be exclusively on PS5.I think :)
I'm on my 100th replay right now, and still can't find "BOI"
Ну и когда выйдет?
Algo decepcionante esperaba mejores gráficos
Waiting so long
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: boy, get ready to fight!
With Ryan Hurst cast as Thor, I just know this will be a great depiction of the mythology.
It's not gonna be on play station 4?
playstation
This is the reason I will buy a PS5 (when I can find one for less than $3000)
Thala is coming
I can't wait play this game!
NINTENDO FANS RIP (I am also one of them 🥲)
😍
woooooooooow hipe level max
Loki and angrboda Parents of jormungandr anda fenrir. This is gonna be interesting
I’m looking forward to seeing what new additions to the traversal, combat and also what ever new weapon or weapons they might add
The trailer: put a girl at the end to mean something. Everyone: who is she? Why is she here??
Cool
Please Sony release this game also for ps4
Please Sony release this game also for ps4
O atreus ta grandão já
My hype = L3 + R3
Meh
Everyone talking about calm and reasonable, and I'm just thinking is that MJ in the last scene this whole multiverse thing is getting out of hand 😂🤣
va estar para ps4 ?
Omfg I’m so excited
I. NEED. THIS. GAME.
LETSS GOOOO
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos - L3+R3
Tyr i kratos öldürecek  tyrin değişik bi amaçı var daha önce den varmıydı ya da tutsak olduğu zaman içersinde mi değişti bilmiyorum ama bu  amacını gerçekleştirmek için artreusa ihtiyacı var bunun için baba oğul arasındaki çatışmayı kullanıp artreusu kendi safına çelecek büyük ihtimal final boss olarak dövüşeceğiz ve sonra baba oğul ayrılacaklar 3. Oyun tekiz
I just want to watch Kratos smash and slash through everybody's mythology.
Légendary 999/999
0:23 they teased ATREUS with thorns on head It was a fan theory lol sony knows how to mess with fans
Is that girl going to be the boys girlfriend?
WHEN THE PROBLEM IS SO BAD THAT THEY NEED TYR
When the PS4 edition releases data?
In norway myth and countries in this age the black people don t exist
Epic
Literal goosebumps
Fecha de lanzamiento???
I'm gonna cry bro
angrboda black, thank you political agenda and netflix for forced nonsense inclusivity.
RIP XBOX!!! 🤣😂😅
At what point Loki leaves to fight the Avengers?
Someone else noticed at 3:05 that in the small credits at the end it says "MARVEL 2021" ? is it possible that they lend the appearance of Thor (from comics and movies) to give him an in-game look?
Kratos es mi esposo!
Kokiii a teenageerr ayye
*Tyr:* [stands up]  *Me:* :O
Why is nobody talking about Angrboda? After all, she is the mother of monsters... and a jötunn that survived... Perfect for Loki 🔥👀❄
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥
Ну конечно же. Куда в конце без негров...
Was it really necessary to put in african girl in scandinavian-like folklore?
🔥🔥🔥
Just EPIC 😍😍🔥🔥
Actually available in France

2:50 You can see Kratos has such a big respect he looked up to him not scared he did the same with Hercules he does not care that he is smaller
Things like this I why I wanna switch to the PS
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Kratos: “And I took that personally”
Yeeeeeeeees! Waited so long for thiiiiissss!!!
Will this game be released on the PS4 ?
Why does it sound like Josh Brolin voices a character?
OP BOLTHE

LETS GOOOOOOOO
Va a ser una pasada. Que hype 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks exactly the same as the last one.. 🤷‍♂️
Que triste vivir en LATAM... 😞

Take my money
Atreus: stop thinking like a father for once and start thinking like a general   "no, kratos replied calmly"
وي
Owwwwwww q fodaa
Pleaseeeeee make Kratos slightly more jacked!!! Little more around the triceps and traps 👌👌
mantab.....game idola saya dari kecil jaman PlayStation 2.
Hopefully we actually get boss fights in this one! NO MORE TROLLS PLEASE!!!
really want to see Tyr do some combat moves
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Every surviving Greek out there: "Its gonna happen again... It will happen again.. It will happen again.."
Into my veins.  I can't wait to play this.
Tyr is like 10ft tall
Ps4 ?
lol , blаск viking girl
Can it run in ps4
This got me all excited. I need to go cut a hole in a grapefruit.
I NEEEED IT!!!!
This is probably the myth nerd coming out, but this game has to cover alot of topics for ragnarok. Fenrir, Surtr, skol and hati, and the destruction of asgard. And hopefully we get access to said asgard, vanahiem and svartlefhiem
Superb kratos coming soon ps4
Epic!!
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person?”   Masterpiece
It’s looking like a dlc lol.  Not even hyped
whattttt😱
PS4???
so it's GODS of wars
Tyr: rises menacingly towering above Kratos. Kratos: Trust me pal, you're not that guy. Ask Hercules
This better be longer than the last one
SONY SONY SONY SONY SONY
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? The Greek gods: HEAVY SWEATING INTENSIFIES
AWESOME 😯😁
Why does loki look like Noah schnapp
:0
Min 01:42 Cory Barlog? Is that You?
Can he go to Egypt next
YEEEES
This trailer brought a Tyr to my eye.
Look like DLC 😂😂😂
Can't wait to play it....now, where to next Kratos..Egypt...maybe Japan or Ireland
BOY is now TEEN!!!
Game looks awesome... but again... I won't be able to play it for 45 years because it'll take me that long to get the actual console. Just saying.
*Does anyone know if the game will also be available for PS4?*
Whos the child at the end?
0:30 Atreus has Kratos old Loincloth or is it me?
Great ♥️🔥🔥
This is a joke right? Why is there a black woman in a Game with nordic mythology? This wokeness destroys everything
3:01 of course we need black skin girl, how we can make game without this :D
only on PLAYSTATION™️
Pretty much the best game of all time
Who dares to dislike this?
Boy : Father..tell me about your past. Kratos : Ever heard of Greece? Boy : No. Kratos: Exactly.
This tickles so many of my feelings ❤️❤️
Daily Reminder that fortnite DIDN'T ruin kratos
This needs to be #1 on trending. All the reaction channels are coming.
WOAAAAA
No se por que siento que tir se paro del suelo como una forma de retar a kratos
3000 dislikes are from magni modi and baldur
I can’t wait to explore all of the realms and see how the events play out!
POV: your watching this for the millionth time
The amount of reuse comment disgust me
Is Odin going to show up?
I need only my ps4 🥰
Just a piece of shield
shut off and take my money 💰
PS4:(?
AHHHHH
Si
Glad he still has the blades will upgrading them make the look different then in the old game ?
Thor: MUÇEI!!!!!!!!
Who's hype for jacksepticeye to play this
achei q ia mudar, mas parece q ainda vou querer socar esse mlk do kratos kkkkkkkk
It looks like the previous one....maybe a bit too much
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Game of the year again, I’m calling it.
ala mrd yo  hasta y poteco mi casa pero debo tener ese videojuego 🥵🥵
I cant wait
CANT FUKING WAIT
I swear that If you give us this to ps4 users, I'll give my soul to sony
Atreus it 's Marco Reus
Great!
I just can't wait to disembowel a centaur from bow to stern again. I AM SO READY FOR THIS!!
It's a movie trailer not a video game trailer
ᚹᛖ ᚨᚱᛖ ᚱᛖᚨᛞᚣ
TYR Looking down at kratos when standing is like the same look Hercules do...
Ожидал увидеть Атрея в возрасте лет так 20+
Didnt see any Asian. What a racist game!
Hype!!!!!!!
Godofwar Ragnerok  bekliyoruz
Godofwar Ragnerok  bekliyoruz
Godofwar Ragnerok  bekliyoruz
Oyunun büyük bölümü jotunhelmde geçecek en azından tyr i kurtarana kadar olan bölüm çünkü tyr jotunhelmde tutsak  ve son kalan dev artreus değil jotunhelmde odinden saklanan bi dev topluluğu var
This game work an PS 4
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT
A Masterpiece...!!
Nel prossimo capitolo Kratos si picchierà con jesu
It will only be on ps5 and there will not be for ps4
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😳
😤
Kratos como siempre haciendo respetar los rangos
Kratos gonna have to kill his own son anit he
Now that’s a mf trailer
I can hardly waittt....Goosebumps!
Где-то радуется один Шивцов )) скоро оближет на столько игру что ...
Two Gods of War in the same shot.
Finally
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The positioning of the stag's horns over Atreus's head in the beginning is just perfect.
Im very Happy and very Excited
😱😱😱😱
This is gonna be a top tyr game
But will it be on PS4
Wow
And here i thought i didn't need a Ps5...
Yeah boy
This is how games should look.
Kratos The best🔥🔥🔥
Eita Porra. Era disso que a gente tava precisando 🤜🤛
the best game
😭😭 I need a PS5 now!!
Asking Kratos if he's a calm and reasonable man is like asking if an alcoholic goes on a sober binge from time to time.
PS4 Graphics 🤮
well looks like it's time to start looking for ps5... :D
I hope Kratos will have more weapons to use
When the one of the best games gets another installment that is even better
Great 👏👏
Guys giving shock  Marvel  wolverine Marvel spiderman 2 GOW Ragnarok
I wish I can just find a PS5 to buy I would prefer an old version considering that the new one has a weaker and smaller cooling system and it runs hotter , I wish you luck everyone who hasn't found one yet
This will never beat old Kratos adventures from GOW1 and GOW2
Not bad, Sony!
Should not shown tyr in the trailer but okay.
So nobody's going to talk about Freya being able to fight?
I watched this trailer now for the 23rd time .Still cant get enough 🔥🔥🔥
Excitement is over 9000
Thor " you seem like a calm and reasonable person   Kratos - L3 R3
pog
Yes, he's a very calm and reasonable person.
The game of the year 2022 right here
Guuyys u are going to be able to ride with Skjoll and Hati 😍😃
I like that you can still hear Atreus’ way of speaking even when he’s grown. That’s a great detail. I wonder who the little girl is.
Amazing😍😍
Awesome amazing incredible plz release it tomorrow 😍
Is it only me that thinks ateus voice is more annoying
Compro 50
imagine if tyr is the main villain
Best Trailer game in 2021
The beast is back in action👏
well that was spectacularly underwhelming
bruh Tyr didnt have to flex that much on Kratos with em height difference though
So this is when they introduce us to Egypt?!
Fun fact: Tyr is 8'5"
Prevent Ragnarok by Kratos and Son is like asking fire to chill
Is it just me or does it look like we go to Svartalfhiem in this game?
This is the game I want to play not gta 5 for the third time with no enhancements
Yesssss yeahhhhhhhh i cant tell my feells
How disappointing this will the last game in the series.
Kratos out here flexing and looking like a pimp
Thumbs up for Ryan Hurst as Thor!
I'm Glad they didn't change the play style much
Who is the black girl??
It's finally here!🤩
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
EPIC🎉😰
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Aaaaaaah meu nariz sangrou akakakakak
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yess enfin ! La légende de retour 🪓
İ love yoy pssss
Am I the only one to get the goosebumps over this?
Just for PS5 ?
YES YES YES YES YES YESY ESTS TES TES TENDTD TE TS
Finally the Twilight of the Gods!!!
Is it just me or is Atreus older?
This isn't look like a next gen game!!...   for me it is just an expansion pack.... 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
0:22 looks like he's wearing his helmet in that scene
I was about to roast Sony about just milking ports but turns out this is a new game. Keep on bringing actual games and the new gen will make sense. So as games that we dont need to downloand and patch every 10 minutes etc. If I bought a game I want to play it not sit and wait to play it and waste my electricity and bandwith on it. Matter of fact my console shouldn't even need to be on the net. It should be just a option for the folks who choose it.
Of course there's a black girl at the end. Gotta inject woke BS somewhere.
Cura da depressão tá ai
Not being able to get a PS5 for purchase anywhere intensifies.
പവർ പൊളി
Главный претендент на звание "Игра года"
Love how the music at the beginning started when Atreus/Loki came into view. Possibly showing the change of hands for main characters for future games
This better live up to the original games
EVERYBODY SHUT UP!! I HAVE AN ERECTION!
Brave for my Afro-Scandinavian ancestors.
I love how when Mimir mentions Odin at 1:14 you can see his two ravens Huginn and Munin in the next shot
I CANT BELIEVE SANTA MONICA DIDNT INCLUDE SOME Q.T.E MOMENT oh well atleast some other viking gods makes an appearance.
People were searching for THOR n Sony presents LOKI….
The opening Poseidon fight in Gow3 was amazing. I assume we will fight Thor in the opening of this game?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😍😍😍😍😍
ANGRBODA!!!
Thor: “are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: *starts humming Rage Of Sparta
Nice
Boy is now teenager
Man they should make a movie with these type of graphics 🙌🔥🔥🔥.
pleaaaaaas make it on ps4 too ???????????????????????????????
Best game ever
DIOS TE BENDIGA SANTA MONICAAAA
Sick
I wish it was a PS5 exclusive but I’m still hype regardless
Why is there a black girl in a game that takes place in Norse mythology?!
Ya lo quiero jugar esta buenisimo el trailer
😲😯
Is it gonna be on pc too?
BOY has turned to GUY, who's ready to "politely and calmly" put down Asgard.        Nah, we RAGING WAR (Heh, 69 thank you people)
E3での前作GoW発表時の興奮も感動も全くなかったのは何故か
Que emoción
Boy became teen, less gooooo
Anyone know when it’s being released
el mejor juego de la historia
Pode ser 500 reais q eu vou comprar na pré estreia FDS

Thor replacing Baldur hunting them this time
Easy Game of the year
Weird that they're ending the Norse Mythology on the 2nd game, ngl.
thor: are you a calm and a reasonable person.          kratos: ask your mom
Manooooo junta dinheiro pra comprar esse agora esse merece muito um dos melhores dos melhores
The mad lads did it

2:54 what girls think 6'0 and 5'11 looks like
I LOVE PLAY STATION
you finally dare your adolescence
Just look thor😅
Well, I need myself a PS5 I guess
Will we fight on the side of the gods of Asgard or against them? if against - I can't play it
Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
This hype is real even though i don't have a playstation🔥
vai lança quando já estou ficando interditado 😠😠
Tyr has still two hands hm
Esperaba un salto gráfico
Can't wait to see Kratos fight thor.
Can we give Bear McCreary props for this awesome music
Same old fighting moves with new scripts
ON FIIIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Got to be Honest waiting for this like FOREVER. When is the Release Date?
No more "Boy"
Wow. Just. Wow.
Mimir has both eyes again... that's interesting.
وينهم العرب 💚🔥👋
For the ones that needs to know. I'm calling him big boy now.
Can’t wait for it to come out
Why do all these characters have American accents
Bbbboooooiiiiii
Can’t wait to play this!
it was perfect till the end..
Awesome
Watched this and thought: "Didn't they make this game last time?"
This just looks like the same game! Is there anything new? Or are you just going to reskin the game because you know people will still buy it?
Tyr was alive i knew it!
Cool, the annoying "Boy!", is now an annoying teenager. Not a fan of the whole family drama stuff, either. Plus, you can tell that Teenager is obviously gonna wanna do angsty teen stuff, and Kratos will say "No, you're not ready." over and over (sometimes too often) while Teenager whines - until Teenager rebels, but proves himself to Kratos.  Unpopular opinion: Tried to like the last game, but found it too annoying, boring, and repetitive. Sorry. Can't imagine this will be any better.
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person ?                   Kratos: yeah Atreus: you're not that guy pal,trust me, you're not that guy
Cannot freaking wait!!!
What about PS4
Se vienee :D
Türkler nerede..
tyr has both hands something is off
<3
ESTARÁ DISPONIBLE PARA PS4?
Couldn't Boy, be older and less annoying, hoping on some time jumps!
G.o.a.t 🐐 of the games ❤️💪🏻🔥
Finally! Release date when??
I cried of happiness cant wait ❤
Ok excuse me but what does a black girl do in a game about the mythology of the possibly whitest people on Earth?!
Did Kratos’ son just summoned a patronus?
Epic!!!
Loki : STOP THINKING LIKE A FATHER, START THINKING LIKE A GENERAL! Flashback of the destruction of Olympus*  Kratos : NOO!
Que delicia cara. Cleiton tá de volta.
So i think we won't be getting adult Atreus until the 3rd one
Are the two wolves that pull the sleigh representations of Skoll and Hati. The wolves that eat the sun and moon.
โดวาคิน
This will be the reason I will buy a PS5.
🥶🥶🥶
🐐
So I do need a ps5
блять как же это охуенно у меня мурашки пошли, Девка в конце скорее всего будущая подружка андрея атрея
FIRE
GAROTO
Acho que agoras eles so vao remasterizar pro ps4 para poder entregar o jogo

AS CRIANÇAS JA SE DIVERTIRAM AGORA E HORA DOS DEUSES
Жду с нетерпением!
I’d buy a ps5 for this
I need it now. My favourite game I’ve played on PlayStation.
Where's the gore at................
PS4?
PlayStation is not playing at all , Goodbye team Xbox
Te last game of kratos
But why is the leviathan axe back to level 1?
No surprise!!!!!!
<3
Awesome!!!!!
Guys guys Kratos will Be worthy to use Thors hammer!!! BET
the Boy can hunt deer on his own. We taught him well.
Kratos is 7 foot tall. That man Tyr needs to hoop frfr 😂
Kratos dont even flinched when Tyr stand up , that beast scare no one
Me da mi que Thor va a preferir a thanos en vez de kratos
"Start thinking like a general"  😳😮Atreus How dare you??? 🤣
sold
Mano, como os olhos voltaram pro Tyr? N estavam os dois no mimir no gow 2018?
Deus abençoe esse jogo sair pra ps4 também, senão terei que sujar meu nome pra comprar um ps5 só pra jogar 🙏
AYO FINALLY
just ps5 ??
Holy f!&*#!# s@!@!
Are you coming with us 🔥🔥
Guys, at 2:11, does that minion comes through BIFROST?!?!?!?
Hóng
Whos the girl at the end?  Shes got some markings on her neck..Possible ambassador to transition into the next universe?
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: L3 R3
Freya kratosun kalkanını kırdıktan sonra yeni bir kalkana ihtiyaç duyacak sidri ve brooka yeni bir kalkan yaptırtacak bu kalkanın daha fazla işlevinin olacağını düşünüyorum
Finally. Time to buy a ps5 for me
Thor sounds awfully like Thanos.
Al fin volverá kratos aunque estoy escuchando rumores dice q será último juego de la saga nórdica almenos sacaquen un juego más para se haga un trilogía
Who is that girl in the end part...
Fkn badass! I hope this one is more violent than the last one.
Absolutely Incredible ⚡⚡⚡
😍😍😍😍😍
2:00 That is the voice of Kratos or the voice of Thor?
Why is it racist when a white guy speaks a fictional black guy but not if a black guy speaks a fictional white guy? Don´t get it.
اخس يا اتريوس كبر
Is that Josh Brolin voicing Thor?
@JACKSEPTICEYE I AM WAITING FOR THIS ‼️
Atreus crick
Im so hyped for this
Tyr still has his hand
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General!  Kratos: Do you see any beings from Greek Mythology now?  Atreus: Umm no, why?  Kratos: Back then, I was thinking like a General
Game of the year 💯
lololololololololol
2022 December or 2023
I can't believe my eyes
Ps2 is best part ❤️
Only ps5?
Caralho mt pika kkkkkkkk 👌
Tyr is very tall
Хрень🤮🤮🤮
I can’t wait this is gonna be goty 100%
whats with the random black girl though??
This will blow up properly pretty soon.
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?" The whole Greek pantheon: Who's gonna tell him?
Atreus lookin badass
Why is there a black girl at the end in a game based on Norse mythology?
Meo deossss
Molo
Death of kratos is comming
Con esa voz me salieron pelos en los pelos
Op!!!
BOIII
Ну и как всегда черная дечетта в конце чтоб доламать наши нервы! Хороша диччета...
Boy
When will it be on pc?
WoW la euforia q sentí al ver a Kratos hermoso
LEGEND😍
I AM SO EXCITED💥💥💥💥💥
Top Tyr👌indeed
Me   At the store mum where is your credit card
I’m so copping the collectors edition
Is it just me or does Tyr resemble Ares a bit? Could just be the beard.
Шедевр
No release date......torture us more plz
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DAY ONE
my lil brother after playing gow4 for 5 mins..... him : I helped baldur killing kratos , now atreus will not come out of basement and ragnarok won't come out me : *-_-* congrulations
Will this be on ps4 or ps5 only?
Kratos:free to play Enemies:💵
Is it just me or does Tyr looks exactly like a taller, non-bald version of Kratos?
If you're seeing this, just don't bother reading comments. 99% are parrots, saying "ArE YoU a CaLm ReAsOnAbLe PeRsOn?" like yeah we hear that you don't have to repeat geez....
W my G.  Best showcase 2021.  Can’t wait to halo come out 😂🤣
Cool
I cant fkn wait dudee!
😨
BUENARDOOOOOOOO
Yes baby,Thank you
Ps5 alma zamanı geldi :)
1:21 amazing graphics
It better not be 30fps
gente vejam oque a anitta comentou no meu video😳😳 eu não esperava que ela fosse dizer aquilo😳..
I did buy ps5 for playing gow 5) but graphics very bad. Graphics gow4=gow5)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪🌪🌪🪓🪓🪓🪓
I loved I love you Playstation❤️🇮🇶
Nordic black person...
TAAAAAAAAAAAAA POORRAAAAAAAAAAA
in love 🤩😍
Looks like a Dlc, not a new game
Fiquei excitado assitindo nisso
That last character is Angrboda. In Norse mythology, she is Loki’s wife and the “mother of monsters” like The World Serpent and Fenrir.   Hmmmmmmmmmm……..
My name si Ragnarok, but everybody calls me dlc...
Only 2.7 million views? I thought I had watched it more times than that.?!
Whoaaa amazing😃🥇
When realest date?
Love u Uncle Kratos
YAH THE KRATOS OF WAR, RAG OF GORE - GODNAROK.
Está ótimo demais! 👍
GGWP GOWR.
i dont know if yall have noticed but the shield has different shapes in different cuts of the gameplay makes me think it will be more prone to changes than before that will alter combat mechanics
Will it be for PS 5 only, or we will be able to play it on PS 4?
Boei
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Dumbledore asked calmly.
Bruh I was pulling my hair from excitement
YES ATREUS VOICE ACTOR IS JOSH KEATON or maybe something else
Μαλακές είμαι πολύ ενθουσιασμένος
Thanks for the video
LETS GO
Hype mega hype ultra hype Hypeness
what are the chances that sony see this comment and gift me ps5 so i can play gow ? 😆 🤣
kratos eres guapisimo hermoso y sexi xd
Wa a chillar
I just cant explain what I saw
LETS GOOOOOOOO
🔥🔥🔥🔥☄☄☄☄
I think if you delete every comment that's about the "Calm and reasonable" line, then there'd only be like 5 comments left.
Прикольно) Ждём.
Goldberg 🔥🔥🤩😂
Cool
My girl Freya :'(
Yes!
Yo esperaba más cosas pero esta bien
Powers aside, the Greek Gods definitely wins in the looks department that's for sure lol.
Don't lie, you have watched this more than ONCE. BOI
Chills. Literal chills.
How much you wanna bet that the main menu is gonna be Kratos sitting there and when you make a new game Atreus comes from the snow.
Seems like Kratos is not Tyr after all
Boy
Theory: the two wolves carrying them are Hati and Skoll the wolves that chase the sun and the moon and catch them during ragnorak plunging the world into darkness. I think they could be taking a different approach with them and who better to tame them then Kratos and BOYYYY!
This is going to be incredible
That ''no'' and the face Kratos makes New meme for the next year Ready to bet anything on it
Seeing Atreus hunting deer by himself now gave me chills. So interested in seeing how he evolves. This is going to be an all out end to the saga, it'll be spectacular. I just don't see it happening otherwise. No release date though.. Maybe late 2022?
Can not wait to play this game, Lets do this
You’ve grown, BOYYYYY.
😍😍🔥
CÓMO LE PONGO ME CALIENTA A ESTOOOOOOO
Horrível, horrível, horrível... repeteco fulera GOW valhalla arrasou a franquia
ааа яндекс красавчики , теперь я могу слышать перевод
牛逼。必须首发。
wakanda forewa rap hip hop george floyd
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Kratos is as calm as Dumbledore
Vai ser bem épico
I hope we get to fight Valkyrie Freya!
Kratos Vs Odin 😆
so did anyone notice how when atreus  walks up with the deer ..the deers antlers resemble lokis helmet 😌
trilogy??
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
А НЕГРЫ ТУТ ОТКУДА???????
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person"? Kratos: " *O* ".
Let’s gooo
Oh yeah
Looks great! Just wish it could come out on the PS4. Otherwise I’ll probably have to pick up a PS5 whenever they go back in stock in 2028...
HOJE ESTOU TÃO FELIZ PORQUE A PESSOA QUE ESTA LENDO É ABENÇOADO POR DEUS E VAI ME ABENÇOAR VINDO AQUI ME CONHECER !! 🙏❤️
Looks exactly like ps4
Seeing Tyr's eyes in Yellow as Mimir's ones, I feel like the developers are gonna repeat the Mimir/Athena kind of thing. Mimir gonna show his true self of betraying Kratos and the Gods and wanting the power to himself or something like that. I feel this.
KRATOS!
Looks rather like director's cut... 😒
I'll play It day 1 but i was expecting much more of the graphics...
Im SO hyped!!!!
I like that the two Gods of War are going to be allies. Thor is so f*cked lol
0:17 That intro of Atreus with Loki’s horns is breathtaking
تنزل عل بلي ٤
was that calliope ?
On one hand GOW R one the other GTA EnE
Just waiting
*sad pc xbox noises*
Os graficos estão identicos ao ultimo do ps4
We better be able to use Thor’s hammer
Ojj
Are we just gonna ignore what looked like Calliope at the end there?!
Pov: you only see “are you a calm and reasonable person” memes
Меня еще никогда так не радовали и разочаровывали за 3 минуты. Неприятно видеть, как до твоей любимой серии добралась левацкая повестка.
this is nice
Play British video games to save the world
Play British video games to save the world (Dante)
i hope the 2 wolves are hati and skoll, that would make it even better
bruh Tyr’s height…😂🤣
This is Lovely! Much Love from Romania!
Korey please keep as eye on this game make it claim game award
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeesss
Melhor personagem de todo os jogo é Kratos
You know in mythological circles Odin and Thor are regarded more powerful then any of the Greek Gods.   This should be one eck of a battle. 🎮
I look forward to not being able to play it on my pc! Not that I can get it on ps5 either because I’m not sure they actually exist anymore
Wow...2:34..Tanngrisnir or Tanngnjóstr
2:08 Jonathan!!!
Oh I was waiting 👑🖤
متحمس😍
Meu play 4 que lute
Yeeeeees!
Atreus looks suspiciously like Loki in the beginning,curious…
Where’s my girl the snake. Pls let the snake be Ragnarok too
Not the slightest idea about nordic lore. Only fantasies of diversity. Go down
Se me puso tiesa
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: L3 + R3
At last theres no 'boyyyyy'😂
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!  Kratos: “oh yeahhhhhh.....”
Ok so Angrboða is here, then it is possible we will see Fenrir and Hel as well? I would love to see both assist Atreus in some way just as Jörmungand did in GOW4 :D
Thor:"Are a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos:"Ask Poseidon."
Кто так же сидел в ожидании подвоха :)
2:45 The cutscene i've been waiting for for 3-4 years
Looks like dlc
Play British video games to save the world - Dante
Pog
I can’t wait for this game but feel like we need to see more blood and guts like the originals series, hopefully kratos let’s out his inner ‘general’ that he’s been keeping locked up
RAPAZ
AI Q LINDO CARA.
A PS4 game.... Where is next gen graphics?
Who is tyr..? his look like zeus.. 😭
Keep in mind that we haven’t seen the big bosses yet
TEEN!
That's just look like DLC
Thor : ‘’you seem like a calm and reasonable person’’  Kratos : ‘’wouldn't you like to know, weather boy’’
kratos vs thor lets goooo
Ya game PS4 ap aya ge kya please answer me it’s very important

WOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Looks to be one of the best trilogy yet
Wow amazing
*BOY!*
I can't wait to search for the 6 impossible items so the dwarfs can make Gleipnir. 1. A woman's beard. 2. The sound of cats footfall. 3. A bear's sinews. 4. The breath of a fish. 5. A mountains roots. 6. The bird's spittle  1. Isn't hard to find nowadays😉
THOR GETTING WORKED ON MOMS
Obra de Arte!!!
"EPIC"🎮🔥🔥
Its on ps4? Not looking next gen.
i see they sprinkled a little bit of their inclusiveness politics there in the end, but whatever, it's a video game.
And this is the only reason I will get a ps5... If I could actually buy one in Australia
So ps5 only?
great
How does Tyr still has its hand? So Fenrir is not aprisionated yet? How will they stop ''Ragnarok'' if the way of it to start hasnt happened yet?
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  (Ghost of Zeus doing spongebob duck meme) aRe YoU a cAlM aND ReAsoNAblE pErSoN?
Ok...
cant wait for another stories of mimir
His son looks like and talks like a fking kid from 2021 .... Why did they do that ffs...

PS5, well hello!
Excited af!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯                     But I'm a pc gamer 😑
So the black girl at the end is Angrboða right? One of the last remaining Giants and Loki's mate, the mother of monsters?
Хочу
Now my body giving a Goosebumps 🔥😍
Waiting for that moments 💞🥺

No graphics improvement ? Whyy
01:29 OH WAIT THERE ARE PEOPLE ROAMING AROUND UNLIKE GOW(2018) THEY ARE DEFINITELY IN THE PAST IN THESE SCENES!!!!!! BUT HOW?!?!
I hope that artreus isn't anoying af, i don't like him
Now this is amazing
the cycle ends here
Ragnarok can't wait for full gameplay 🤩
I just can’t . To insane
War is not the only way but massacre is another way
This game better be over 15 hours at least.I dont think they can properly develop Thor,Freya,Odin,Tyr,Hel,Surtr,Fenrir in any shorter timeframe
انا اتمنى ان تتوفر على سوني 4
Seems more like a gow4 dlc, pretty underwhelming trailer but i hope the game is fun
К тому моменту как она выйдет, у меня возможно появится PS5. Два, три года, в запасе точно есть!
culitos
Ok so it is Tyr on that last wall painting in gow4
Wth does a dark skin girl do in norse mythology ?
I WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST OF ‘EM ALL OUT THERE!!!!  THOR: ARE YOU CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON? KRATOS: JUST RAISES LEFT HAND AND CALLS Mjolnir AND LOOK INTO THOR EYES AND SAYS “YOU DO NOT WANT THIS” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THOR ARE YOU CLAM AND REASONABLE PERSON KRATOS YESSSSSSS NOW THATS HOW YOU START A GAME CANT WAIT
OHHHHHHHHHHH
PS4 release?
Cant wait for "Boy"
Трейлер офигенный я хоть и не прошёл 4 часть уже хочу 5
YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Yeye yee boy! It is 🤘😝🤘fantastic
Idk man, this trailer shows a lot and no release date was specified, don’t get too excited about playing this within 2 years
Tyr stands  It reminds me of Hercules
It is so beautiful
Brilliant
2:48 when you ask the oldest sibling to go somewhere with you
is it the same actor for atreus, he seems like he grew a lot xD
It was a long time ago that a game trailer gave me goosebumps and let me hold my breath, but here we are
*joyous internal screaming intensifies*
Блин ,я только недавно продал ps4 🤦🏻‍♂️
from what religion is that girl from the end?, she doesnt strike me norse at all lol
Loki...my be here.
Thor sounds like Josh Brolin. (Thanos, for all the kids). Just saying.
Bruhhhh I got excited
So you re telling me its not gonna be on ps4?😔😔
Is this the last game of the northern saga?Or will there be another one after this?
Kratos: The dwarfs are gonna be busy upgrading our new weapons like: My (Thor's) Hammer. (Mjolnir) My (Odin's) Spear. (Gungnir) My (Hogni's) Sword. (Dainslief) My other (Sigmund's/Sigurd's) Sword. (Gram) My (Frithiof's) magic Sword. (Angurvadal) My (Heimdall's) other magic Sword (Hofund) My (Hròlf Kraki's) extra sharp Sword. (Skofnung) And my (Svafriami's) also magic Sword (Tyrfing)  Atreus his new Dagger/Wand. (Laevateinn) And Atreus (Frey's) his mysterious Sword. (Sumarbrander)
не припоминаем чтобы в северной мифологии были негры .диз за негров.

O monstro tá vindo !!
LET'S GO!!!
hurry up can not wait
GREAT!!! HE AND HIS BOI ARE BACK!!!
wow
будет версия на PS4
Loki's voice is like ekko from League of legends
LEGENDARY 🔥👑
So tem playstation em alta kkk so jogo fod@
All the upcoming legendary games are playstation exclusive and I've just build gaming PC 😌😌😌..This world is so wicked..
Papai!!!! 0.0
ㅅㅂ... 쩐다...
All I can say is FINALLY
Will Mimir s head and body be finally reunited tho? That s the Q
Take my money 💲💲💲
Que empiecen las teorías locas! :3
I love how Kratos voice is a huge Japanese guy
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Now I just need to get my hands on a ps5
I tought Tyr only had one hand
Interesting... 🤔
Tyr reminds me of Beorn from The Hobbit.
Please kratos don't kill Freya 😉
lemme guess, Kratos is gonna fight Tyr before he comes with them.
Maybe I might enjoy this one more then the last one knowing what it’s gonna be like
Do you think that girl at the end is Sigyn, Loki’s wife?
Spider-man 2, Wolverine and a new GOW?? Yeah y'know what. I'm done with Xbox. Time to switch
- Norse mythology *Lets add black person*
The Axe vs the Hammer.  Mind blowing
Ha el único comentario en español
I'm gonna be honest.... I'm little worried because Cory isn't the director.
Will it be released on ps4?
Опять кинцо... Я конечно понимал что слешера точно не будет, но могли бы хоть сделать на манеру Dark Souls, но нет... Снова 60% игры будут кацсцены
It looks like DLC for the last game. Same game mechanics, level design and character conflicts.
Esperava mais
Hello. Thank you for video. :)
Why is there black skin in Norse mythology?
Okay its truely a PS5 game. Even in 1080p, we can see the difference. Now thats interesting
Já estou ansioso para poder sentar a porrada no Thor, com o Kratos e Atreus trabalhando juntos para destruir Thor, venha Ragnarok
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Iiiiii... Zeus Interrupt. Zeus: NO, he is my son and I know him well. That's why Noo.
Not funny i play already
Watched this trailer 5 times already! So excited!!!!
ARE YOU READY I AM READY
When Atreus is walking in with the deer, it looks like he has the Loki Horns on his head
Very Nice👏👏👏👏👏
CANCER
I've been seeing a lot of comments saying why lokis wife is black and I just wanna ask, do yall hate black people that much?
2:51 Thor?
Gow trailer : giant intimidating snek Gow:r trailer : 🐻
Boy Stop crying....,😩 You got Xbox not me😝🤣🤣🤣😋
Atreus’ baby momma at the end, oh boy this game is gonna be a blast
no more Sunny ?
We gotta find him.
А здоровяк в конце трейлера с коричневой бородой, это Тор?
Yeah I know blah blah kratos kill everyone blah blah, but something feels different with Thor here
اروع شي لمة قال لي ابوه هل سوف تأتي معنا معقولة كريتوس يطلب المساعدة راح  تتدمر الحضارة الاسكندنافية من قبل زوس وابنه🔥🔥🔥🔥
of course they made angrgoda black why I'm not surprised?
so glad to see next game coming
At the end, the young girl face expressions are so realistic... I'm very impressed !  Great job the GOW team !
I love it 😍😍
Song name
The is amazing
Looks interesting, but please stop with the race swapping. You're really not helping the cause you think you're defending.
Tyr is super tall. Freya is an enemy now, and Thor is a Big Fat MF and I’m here and ready for all of it
I want a ps5
IT'S HAPPENING. YESSS..
В целом круто, но зачем запихали сюда негра?
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person Kratos: *Wouldn't you like to know*
Ps4??
Ps4 and ps5❤
Looks cool and all but that American accent really doesn’t fit well 🤦‍♂️
Pls ps4 pro
Графика та же, просто продолжение
0:21 notice how the deer horns look like the helmet of loki, Just another reason i love santa monica and their use of foreshadowing
I hope he decides to use his full power and let us use the jump button.
2:10 "I am Thor." "In a few minutes, you will be."
Brings some Tyr to my eye. Can't wait!
Where is the game date?🤔
The age of the token black female thrown into literally every single piece of entertainment has begun. We get it companies and studios -- you aren't racist... we get it.
😳🖤
Have to add the generic black female at the end huh?
He need to grow old... always kids...
❤2022❤
I like that they included Angrboda. The girl at the end. She will be Loki s girlfriend and the mother of his children, Hela, The Wolf 🐺 and the Midgard Serpent.
Is it just me or Atreus looks kinda ugly or it's just not finished 😂
Oddio che hayp
Boi is turning into man
I CAN’T WAIT TO PLAY THIS!!!!
Amazing
I guess was just the PS4 version? Will there be a PS5 one too? Or is it just another DLC/directors cut that we have to pay extra for a game we already own..!
Я как бы.уже взрослый но почему вижу эту плашку?
Meh...
Thor te van a meter una mega pitiza que hasta para Loki va alcanzar
This game finna be crazy
BOY
Is this playable on ps4??
For sale: PS4
This game will probably blow us all away once again but I gotta say that I'm surprised that this one apparently already finishes the Norse Saga... I really thought it's gonna be a trilogy again like the Greek one.
ahahahahhahah another nitcher
❤❤❤
தமிழ் இருக்கீங்களா
I NEED DAYS GONE 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ohh ¡¡ME VENGO!!
Afronordics
why is aterius is still a BOI?
Thor: Are u a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Here we go again
LES GOOOOII
Thor : " Are you a calm and reasonable person"  *Rage of Spartan intensives* Thor : oh ....
I just wanna know why they're doing a PS5 showcase when hardly anyone can even buy them yet!
The game looks as same as GOW 4. Nothing has changed. And now a girl in the end. What is this game turning into? 😭😭 Gosh I miss the old series. 🥺
Muy bonito y todo pero no vi nada nuevo de Next gen, es como el gow 4.
So what is the date?
So tyr is not kratos like some theories explained
Here's the game of the year 2022
Se ve un juego de ps4 ,no se ve de nueva generacion. Parece un dlc del anterior juego. Haced el juego para ps5 de una vez,que para eso me compre la consola😡
Chills on my spine, when the theme starts on the beginning 🥶
Actually I am a calm and reasonable person.
Ждём с нетерпением)))
Well i gotta say this looks a lot better than the last at least but nothing will beat gow 3
Same awful 3rd person camera angle behind Kratos, obscuring almost half of the freaking screen... At least give us the option to pull it back like in the GTA/RDR games.
I love my game
Kratos: Where do we go?  Atreus: In the direction of Tyr.
Atreus sounds like Gumball Waterson
Yo I was right Frey’s was gonna become an enemy bc she asked minor while u were in jotenheim where here wings were since she needed her warrior spirit back bc u kill her son baldur in the end which makes her mad
Casting Ryan Hurst as Thor I have to say is some fantastic casting. Can't freaking wait to play this 👏
Me : Can't wait... 😃 i wanna pay now😥 . . . . Kratos : Boy u r not ready...🤯🤪
This is just a ps4 pro game from graphics perspective, but i love  the gameplay and i am sure that this will be amazing to play ! Imagine if this was PS5 exclusive....oooo boy !
WOW NEW DLC FOR GOW....
Nobody talking about the absolute banging tunes in this trailer
That's the next DLC?
O shoot I didn't realize but Atreus looks like a teen now sheesh
Sure would be nice to see a differing opinion in these comments...
For ps4?
If only atreaus knew what kratos did a few games back...
Will it realise for the ps4 too?
COME ON!!!!! IT'S GONNA BE LE-GEN-DA-RY
That video is the call to buy the PS5.
That last shot :) You couldn’t resist could you? :)
Слава Богам!!!! Вальхалла
I really hope that this also comes to PS4. Since getting PS5 is hard.
Ps5? No ps4?
Who else has a testosterone spike playing GOW?
Oh fck last moment trailer sweet home Alabama
A failed game I don't like.
Imagine being the most wanted man in the whole galaxy and then sitting with your back to the cave entrance...
looks like puberty hit Atreus as bad as it hit me while gow ragnarock came out
Kratos: “Are you coming”  Tyr: *stands taller than him*  Kratos: “I thought you’d be bigger... but you’re definitely the one. Long way from Home aren’t you?”
The boy has become a man!
My heart!!!
Souka.
Finally!! I'm so excited to get this!!❤
Чёрная тянка с самолётом в волосах это конечно сильно, скандинавия хули (◕‿◕✈️)
Diosssss!!!! Graciassss!!!!
Las leyendas nunca mueren…
This is LEGEND!
I wonder how they’ll deal with progression because I unlocked and discovered a LOT but this looks like a continuation in the same world
Stop acting like a father and start acting like a jeneral (Atreas death wish)
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos: “Ask your sons. Oh wait…”
teaser 2020 trailer 2021 final trailer 2022 Actual game releasing date = 2025
This might become the greatest game in history
Is it coming on ps4
Great game
In moment of crisis panic does nothing harness it let it serve you.   This phrase alone can heal you!!
Wow, Boy's voice is almost half as deep as Kratos'
3:04 ah yes A black girl wearing Nordic traditional clothing. Cue the blackwashing of nordic culture
I will bună this
Sunny Suljic should do a Mid-2000s movie a sequel to Mid-90s!!!
not gonna talk about Atreus NOSE
Asking for another titan … sorry I meant giant for help … looks like here we go again
💯💯💯💯💯💯 it will be the game of the year 💯💯💯💯
looks likes DLC )
XBOX IS THE SUPERIOR CONSOLE!!!!
Alwyas before November they showing the best games xD
Kratos: Are you coming with us? Tyr: getting bigger Kratos: hercules looks
This looks exactly like gow4 😅😅
Я бы не убирал отца спустя там допустим несколько частей. И выучив сына сын отправляется в собственные приключения. И отец свои выполняет задания. Иногда бы они у меня встречались и вместе путешествовали. И даже можно было бы сделать две игры за отца и сына отдельный большие Триплл АААА игры. А то что не игра обязательно убивают отца раньше старости))) И собственного отъезда на тот свет.
AEEEE CARAÍ
Why is angrboða played by an ugly model? IRL Atreus will not date her.
My dual shock instincts are already tingling
Why does Angrboda looks african? Either this is force diversity or she is like Atreus and one of her parents is from an african pantheon, i really hope is the later
Aburrido ya de la moda Vikings
Para qué consola saldra
Im waiting for the moment of truth when you are now able to press X to jump.
Santa Monica made the world of excitement happy for all the gamers especially the gamers of Kurdistan 😍❤️😍❤️😍
Tschoo Tschoo! Hypetrain!
ABOBA
:-000000
Ehm...anything new is here? Except black person
Is Kratos a calm and reasonable person why didn't he asked the greek gods         OH 😅
Será que o início foi uma referencia aos chifres do loki?
only reason why I bought a ps5.
All this man wanted to do was teach his son how to hunt...
What a cheeky ending haha
Is it me or the GRAPHICS look the same
This trailler got me crying.
it should be a dlc not a full game
It's a nice looking PS4 game
I was expecting better
playstation knocking it out of the park. again. and again.  dont crunch devs, we players can wait a few more months
I am waiting
Atreus 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Hyped ❤ 🔥
Looks like svarthalheim
"YOU DO NOT WANT ME TO THINK LIKE A GENERAL BOI"
Brasil. Ps5 e ps4!!!
Trailers like these hurt as an Xbox user.. 😫
Angrboda=trash
No way, is that the girl from Polar Express?
For Ps4?
I will make you suffer ❤️❤️❤️
Dang...I can't wait for this movie
😘😘👍❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍
Jogão caralho !!!
混沌之刃 好怀念
thor: are you a calm and reasonable person  Kratos: lol no.
GOW ♥️♥️
Fire fire fire fire fire
No ps5 yet
This I’ll get a ps5 for.
Im so hyped... even i won't play it/:
Thor : Are you a clam and reasonable person? Kratos : Ask the Greeks! Greek God's : ☠️💀☠️
My favorite Game
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person  Zeus: don’t do it bro
Ps4: I'm sorry, me: do not be sorry, be better.
Шикарно! Ждём
Josh Brolin???
What a time to live . . .
Bruma bruma !!!não estou pronto kkkkkk
Bro ...I just realise that something on the Wolf 🐺
What's the point of having that last scene with Tyr? Kratos already took out giant titans "Oh no he's like two feet taller than Kratos!? :O"
Bro I just came I'm so excited
Are some people really that dumb, why do the keep asking if it's coming out for ps4 and saying its coming out 2021.
F*ck! There was me thinking I would get away with not buying a PS5.
Let’s be honest just seeing Mimir chilling in the house and reading books was the best part of the trailer
👍📺👀
General? Has Kratos told him every single dete of his previous life? Atreus doesn't knows what he is asking. "You're not prepared, boy! My spartan training is too intense for your feeble build!"
I dont know what to think really. Looks like the last game but they seem to have grown a little brave, idk if im on board with that.
that's nice... If we only could find an available PS5 to buy...
Oh look they put diversity of colors for the sake of WOKE for no reason ..
Wait… are we able to transfer our armours from 2018 GOW to this new one? 🙏🏿😬😬
The game that Assassin's Creed is trying to be, is here!
2.5k dislikes from Odin,Thor and Freya
Kratos prolly will end up being murked by the end of this game or its DLC due to the prophecy (but atleast we get to go to Asgard!)
Yesss we get to see Tyr. Hope he doesn't turn into an antagonist
2.5 k dislike.... hello XBOX fans
Welcome back 🙋🏻‍♂️
Joder casi cumeo
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: Sure, ask the Greek pantheon
Is this captured on a PS4 Pro?
Coming to PS4 too !
Isso vai ser muito pika
می خوااااااااااااامش
Oh WOW! there's a Black girl in this game!!!! SO INCLUSIVE I'M TOTALLY GOING TO BUY IT
Nothing less than a Hollywood movie.
Kratos handling Freya like a crazy ex
Gilax
Thor 😁😁😁
🔥🙏🏻
1:11 this is reminded me of Lollipop Chainsaw Nick Carlyle head
Tyr standing up in front of Kratos makes Baldurs statement that he thought Kratos would be bigger makes more sense.
I wish Thor had a norse accent
War isn't the only way but it's fun !
Think like a general??do you really know your father history?
thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person  Kratos: what’s that circle doing above your head?
Ai meu deus eu vou morrer!
ade patta oiii
Графон любовь 😍😍😍 играла в предыдущую часть...великолепная
Диз за нгра/азтку ... ну вы поняли)
I'm so hyped
Почему в скандинавской мифологии есть афро девочка? Это шутка такая толерантная?
Is this for PS5, because the graphics look like PS4 game
🤯
B r u h
The way Kratos says "No" when Loki tells him to "starting thinking like a general". The amount of PTSD this man is carrying.
Im not racist but by adding random black people in the game that take place in Scandinavia mythology it make no sense and doesn't help to stop racism
Finally, Atreus successfully hunted the deer.
Will it be on ps4 , if someone knows plz tell me i don't have a ps5 and i wish to play it
Tyr will rage seeing Kratos with his armour
Как же без негров то....
Wow, that trailer was awesome!!!!!!! You really think Kratos can stop Ragnarok?
No one I say no one can beat this game not even spiderman 2.
The excitement I’m feeling right now
2:26 top right corner. Looks like a dark elf is charging alongside kratos and atreus
BOOORAAAAAA POHAA TÁ SAIDO DA JAULA O JOGO!!!!
thor isnt black, they are racist
GOTY 2022
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”   Kratos: “Yes”   Maury Povich: “ you said you were a calm and reasonable person, our lie detector and your history determined THAT was a lie”   Crowd: bbbooooooohhhh!!!
They literally spoil about finding Tyr but anyway
AYOOOO
Its an Open world?? Or its more the same
Boy
A shame that this is the last game in the reboot/sequel series
War Isn't The Only Way  Calm And Reasonable Person  Zeus be Like - Wot Is this Behaviour Bro
2:25 is that artemis?
My eyes: Sees normal people walking around. My mind: *Ragnar Lothbrok* 💪😎👍
Best character development any game franchise has ever witnessed
Vrgggg se ve bien mamalooon
"Shut up and take my money!" (с)
who is that girl supposed to be at the end of the trailer??
Wait, so no more BOY!
Well, liké FIFA. Same game with some graphic improuvements.
espero que nao seja tao caro kkkkkkkkkkk
Ah yes Kratos "A calm and reasonable man"
"coming to playstation console not yet available" telling the truth from the man.
the end trailer was loki’s future wife angrboda
Tyr ❤
Is Tyr like 8-9 feet tall?
Is it PG-13?
Marvel Bois:- hey did u know thor is invincible, GOW gamers:-laughing in mind,"yes, bro "
look at freyas face
Sony 🤝
BOOOOOOYUY
THOR vs KRATOS  Can't wait ❤️
Thor:"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?" Kratos:Leave my home..
BOY.
2:55 dej ja vue,  it's like looking at Hercules again before he got his face deformed by kratos 😂
why does Tyr looks like Zeus ??
this will certainly not be on ps4
Same Gfx , not improved. Ps5 can do better .!
The King is back!♥️
Kratos: "i am a calm person" Asgard: "I feel vulnerable"
Tyr still has both his hands….
Now we are talking!!! 👍
wow its been a long time since the last one in 2018 eh?
As a scandinavian i really appreciate that they spelt ragnarök with ö
Soooo stoked for this. I got the PS4 just to play the 2018 game. Very happy they made the desicion to bring it out for both the new and old one.😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Is it Zendaya at the end of the trailer?
🔥🔥🔥
We want on ps4 too :(
Black Angrboda, this is Ragnarok, indeed.  Action though is what makes GoW GOW.
1:45 Yikes  Only in limited places 🥴🥴🥴
i lost count how many times i've watched this trailer
Who was that at the end?
RELASE DATE? BAH
The fact that atreus is riding his own magic deer is awesome
I'm very happy even though I won't be able to pay, at least I'll see
Can't wait to play this in 2022
IT'S GANNA COME OUT ON 2021????
Mantap
Eita pohaa
New dlc😅
круто
This Is Highly Anticipated For Everyone. Including Me As Well Honestly.
Wow, I'm blown away!
this game look already like a 100/10
f my day blessed
I hope deimos will make an aparition
Will this release on ps4.?
Did Kratos did therapy?
ok its time to buy PS5
👀🙀❤️
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *No*  Thor: Understandable, have a great day!
Is it coming to PS4 or no??
Yes.
Great to know that Tyr will feature in Ragnarok, i can see him being a really positive influence to Atreus who seems a bit eager for conflict in this trailer. Cannot wait.
Finally
OMFG
Do not what what watuwatu
GOTY
When Brok asks what happened to Atreus it makes me wonder if maybe not that much time has passed so everyone is confused as to why Atreus has grown so much. This could then be explained by him being a giant he grows faster than most other races.
Mais do mesmo. Zero inovação.
GOW: Boooy GOWR: Teeen
Now please release the last GoW on PC
ps4
What about the graphics. It looks like the previous one
Atreus can hunt on his own now
Let's put a random black girl in the Norse mythology because DIVERSITY.
I hope that they'll make a Ps4 version for this fenomenal game!
no comment just its a  "master piece"
Wait why is Ragnarok being released in 2022?
this gave me the giddy giddys
Already game of the year
90% of comments: Are you a calm and reasonable person?
I think the most hype thing that made me excited for this trailer was Freya showing up to actually take revenge on Kratos. Can’t wait to see how that plays out.
I appreciate Thor using gender neutral language
Я тут не понял только на пс5 выходить.
Epic👍👍👍
А можно, продолжение прошлой части!?
PS4 ?
Again game of the year full hype
Copy and paste .. add new characters  Here is new game.  It seems like dlc
I think we will have the rune travel to the dwarves realm
kratos is fricking ba!
Hey.where is the jörmungander??!!! Wait a second, are these wolves Loki's sons?
MASTERPIECE
Black girl she is Loki's wife Angrbode.
GOW has always been legendary! Thank you Santa Monica!
Tyr still has both his hands.
Why is there a black lady ?
Is the voice artist of kratos changed?
The wolves pulling Kratos's sled might be a  reference to Skoll and Hati, which were said to be chasing the sun and moon. One has bright fur, and the other has dark fur, referencing the sun and the moon. At Ragnarok, it was said they'd catch their prey and collapse the sky.
Guys does it come for PS4 or just ps5
Ryan Hurst as Thor… I didn’t see that coming…
THE HYPE IS REAAAAAAAAL
when is the game will release I will spend all my money
PS4 GRAPHICS!!!
I hope releases in ps4 too who else expect too ?
Time the Egyptian Mayan Celtic Pacific African Asian Hindu and Native gods to get involve against Kratos and Loki
I can already feel the vibrations of my controller with every punch and slash
I can't wait!
R.I.P PS4
I can't wait!
Do you think tyr will know that's kratos? And he will call him by him name always. "Kratos! Calm down!
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" The Greek gods: you gotta surprise coming
Un juego compra-consolas
2:53 who is that ?
+10$ for ps5 😏
ااااااا
Solos🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Týr still has his arm. Which means he'll probably lose it to Fenrir in this game.
This is not a game its a movie
Bruh, was that Minecraft Steve?
SHEEESH
AMAZING!
I love how the sequel is like an entire movie
Who was that random black girl in a norse setting?
since when did norse mythology had blacks in it
finally
Tyr looks like Kratos older brother
hello please rate my content.🙂
Caraca, o jogo tá incrível :D Mal vejo a hora de jogar😎
Крутая графика
Waiting for this..
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS BOI

Looks amazing
احلا تحية الك ولكل العرب المسلمين💞اخوكم من الجزائر😍😍🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿❤️❤️باقي9على50😩😩😩
Wishing everyone in this comment section will be able to own PS5 to play this game including me.
1:20 there is an S on Atreus's shoulder which is the symbol for loki in the mythologies and Kratos obviously has his Omega on his shoulder
“Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Greek gods: …..oh yeah he is so calm isn’t that right Helios he is so calm…..oh wait Helios can’t talk because HE HAS NO HEAD!!!!
thor kinda sound like thanos i legit though it was Josh Brolin who voiced him
Yessss... Tyr is alive
Это вынос башки)ждууууу🤤🤤
Шедевр
Can you please bring us some blood instead of just sparkles this time?
It's gonna get Game of the year again 🔥
3:07 in case you forgot how ancient Scandinavians looked like.
Is this on ps4 also
Me: Why is Tyr’s head so big? Me: oh  Me: OHHHHHHHH
Mungkin habis ini Kratos bakal menghancurkan para dewa mesir kuno
Can't wait!! This is going to be sooo hype!! BOY!!!! 😂  The game looks amazing.. Like GOW with improvements.. Cant wait! GOTY? I hope so!!
Sony afterwards: 150$ for GOW
Can't wait to 100% this game!!
Where’s Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins?
OMFG YES
BOY!
Негры в скандинавии. Отлично. Ждем прохождения от Куплинова
Can i like........Buy the game NOW.....i dont really care if it isnt done yet
leave the old hipster alone
To be honest I wonder if Hella will be in this😂
Loki is everywhere 🔥😂
I can't wait to play this it's gonna be epic
komputers-best
Is tyr half jotnar XD lol he's huge
Its seems that the combat are almost the same. I want to see more hand to hand combat and combos
Whens the release data
Tyr still got both of his hands here And if I'm not wrong Loki (Atreus) will be the reason for him to lose one
DAD OF WAR IS BACK :D
This is the 20th time I'm watching this trailer since last night 🥺
War is coming
Первый был самый харизматичный, а этот кавердос говно чел хорец ёпрст. 👎
❤️❤️
Wish this was also available for PS4 like Horizon Dawn 2.  At least, it would be tradition where one PS generation has 2 GOW games. PS2: GOW1 & 2 PS3: GOW3 & Ascension PSP: GOW Chain of Olympus & Ghost of Sparta  Now, the chain is broken with GOW PS4 and GOW Ragnarok PS5.
Ооооо дааа
Hope the new director of GOW Ragnarok meet my expectation as Cory Barlog did.
Atreus grown up now. When I can be like him..
Hmm but what happened to kratos in Egypt trailer?
A M W A T I N G ....
Gears 5??
I will buy a PS5 for this game
Elden ring pls.
It looks great, but it certainly looks like a PS4 Game, so it makes sense that it's coming to that console. And it looks done! wouldn't be surprised if it came out sooner rather than later.
Omfffffggggg
Realease date is surprise 😊
Ok I'm gonna get a ps5
i hope that game will be on ps4
❤❤
wow, dude just wow. There are no more words that can describe what I felt when I saw this video.
Fat Thor and some black girl. Yeah, right... Authentic as s..t.
Just say woow wooow wooow , its big big video game in the world 🌎 💪💙💙💙
My boy is a man now
Yessss we want more of thisssss🐍
Watching this in 4K on an Oled is  blowing my mind. This looks CG. PS5 is a beast.
The girl at the end of the trailer in norse mythology mates with loki and gives birth to jormungandr, fenrir and hel.

А где негры?
This is already game of the year. Beautiful work.
NO PUEDO SOPORTARLO, SAL YAAAAAAA QUE QUIERO JUGARTEEEEEE!!!!!!!
Need the Spartan Rage back
Разъёб
еббббаааа😱😱😱😱
Что то в графике вообще разницы не вижу с 4 про!
там негр в конце трейлера!!!!
Finally
Still the BESSSSSST
The gods of Olympus have abandoned me...now there is no hope .. ...And Kratos  cast himself from the highest mountain in all of Greece....After ten years of suffering, ten years of endless nightmares, it would finally come to an end, death, would be his escape from madness. But it had not always been this way, Kratos had once been a champion of the Gods !!!
Maybe next kill Egyptians gods
Please tell me this game is also come for ps4 right ?
CAME
İs coming
Freya looks scary
this is ps4pro➕ 🎮
I bought my ps5 for this. Cant wait!!!
New Kratos Weapon confirmed! 🔨😂
We all know what happened when Kratos acted as a General. The coloss of rhodos is no more.
This doesnt look like next gem game
I hate this camera angle. What is happening with this game?
Holy Zendaya!
If kratos was calling Atreus "BOY" in gow4, what would he call him in gow5?  Dude?
Please not afro american even in scandinavian myth .......
Waiting this game is amazing bdw love from india
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: "dunno, ask poseidon about how calm i am when i "talk" to him
Why? Why is the character slightly to the left? Whyyyy?
Terá para o PS4 tbm ??!
Only reason to buy ps5
War, War Never Changes
No waiting plzz
Well tyr still has both hands lol
Only ps5?
DLC?
TarumLüg Programmierer der Master K.I.
Where is thor
Thor:"are u calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: Ask the gamers...
Kratos - Nice Hammer Thor - You are not worthy Kratos - Is that so!!!!!
3:05 . Publisher: "Hey black people! Buy this game too"!!
War.......war never changes.
ترلیر عالی بود💖🌟🔥
You think kratos is going to Loki to Greece to what when you go to war with gods?
Está bueno el DLC del 4
Why I'm hyped when Tyr showed up ?
Take my money now!
I'm calling it this game is going be game of the year
Release date?

The TVA WILL CAPTURE THIS LOKI
0% Bad words 0% Boring things 50% Rage 50% Goosebumps
Never realized those huge statues of Tir were actually accurate.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: Yes...(glances at Rage Bar nervously)
Pog
Wow
Негры в скандинавской мифологии, это как черные эльфы в Ведьмаке. Немножечко пиздец.
Где Кратос который убивал богов и жарил Афродиту? Что это за дед алкаш с соседнего подъезда??!
2.3k dislikes from those who get enough of boiiii lol
Gow ragnarok
3:05 Political agenda👎
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Tyr ainda com a mão direita, alguem vai perder uma mão nesse jogo! Kkkkkkkk
So hyped!!!! 8D 8D 8D
Yall we should give playstation a break now 😂
Am I the only one noticing all the Egyptian things in this? I think tyr might be trapped in Egypt
Je suis un très grand fan de ce jeu s'il vous plaît mettez-le sur PS4 aussi Je n'ai pas assez d'argent pour acheter une ps5 s'il vous plaît   C'est le meilleur jeu du monde
افضل لعبه بالتاريخ
🤙
I am a very big fan of this game please put it on PS4 too I don't have enough money to buy a ps5 please This is the best game in the world
I see they're getting on the viking hype train. Choo Choo!
1:55 "stop thinking like a father *bruh moment* and start thinking like a general!"
The game of the year 2022
Perfect 🎮
The deer antlers looking like Loki’s horns
The enemies and monster designs are looking much better.  I wonder where Jormy went... also if we'll see Loki's other children Fenrir and Hel
When will the game industry understand we just want games like these!! its dope!!!
Instead of orange blood, there is no blood at all now. Hopefully that was just for the trailer.
красиво 👍
Ragnarok is Coming Kurdish up
Amazing
Is it only for ps5?
Yeah
Power ⚡⚡⚡⚡
That tyr and kratos stare down 💯
Fire 🔥
Ну шо пацаны? Гад оф вар!?
Boii
I love this game iam waiting
Who is the tall guy at the end ?
I watched this like 20 times
Waiting for it
Hmmm, Angerboda looks different somehow, something is wrong... but what? Hmmm xD
Now this is a video game
I feel like that one guy in the audience at one of Dave Chappelle's specials on Netflix, "Santa Monicaaaaa!"
Only on ps5?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:54 "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"  Boi, you have absolutely no idea...
OMFG! never in the anytime the Hype train was so loaded!!
What on earth is the black chick doing there. Smells like racism and deliberate misrepresentation  cloaked in "inclusion"
Black female at the end for all the woke people :) how nice !
Мы Русские, с нами Кратос:)
Deu até arrepios
Thor sounded like Mark Hamill and I'm here for it.
I guess he won't be saying boi anymore :(
and the random dark skinned child appeared the last seconds to ruin it
That was a cool trailer, I can't wait for this game to come out now😁!  *Checks comments*  Yep. Gamers are angry that black people exist
Thor: You look like a calm and reasonable person, Are you a calm and reasonable person? Atreus: Actually he's a... Kratos: BOY!!!!
Tyr's eyes man!!
Blm-angrboda 🤮
всё понятно,тема детей не раскрыта
I want to see the reaction of Atrea if he learn his father's l past
Calliope?
Now I just need a release date and then I'll order a PS5!
I'm ready Kratos! For you
What's sad is that I want to play this but won't probably be able to get my hands on a ps4 still D:
Just for Ps5 only.?
Thor: are u a calm and reasonable person to the guy who wiped out Olympus lol
НАКОНЕЦ-ТО
Can't wait to play this DLC
I qm juwt going to say this now, unless that black kid at the end is ment to be a tie in to the african, aboriginal or the egyptian gods then she has no business being there, it is a game about the old nordic gods....
Wow
DLC
The boyeee is as annoying as ever.
little black girl at the end... we leaving Scandinavia!
2018 GOW pc pls
Nice. But why didn't they get Keith David to do Krato's voice? It's much more deeper. Check Goliath from Gargoyles. But the voice is still alright :)
The irony of Kratos being against war. He really has learnt from Tyr's example.
WHEN?
Me: looks at my wallet after watching trailer My wallet:DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
atreus voice became deeper nice
Was that Storm Reid at the end? Or at least the character was modeled after her?
Just imagine if we could use Thor's hammer after killing/defeating him
Kratos : Are you coming with us Tyr : Stand up.  Tyr realized thats Kratos. Tyr sit down again
Game for the one time 😒
Solo pido que este en PS4 Xd
Be geat if we can get PS 5 in Australia.
So Tyr is the new tall character in the video game after Lady Dimistrecu!
GOW RAGNARÖK looks like GOW 4's DLC but I believe this game on PS5 will look way better than on PS4
Any tamilans from India🤔🤔
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person” I guess Thor forgot that he split his son in two and Atreus stabbed the other one in the neck
Atres is grown so much
Looks too similar to the previous one - disappointing
One day i will do live in my channel
Kratos is my favorite
"You seem like a reasonable and calm person." Kratos: Define CALM.
At last
You can’t expect the gamers to play this game, because all the actual Ps5s are in the showcases of eBay and corporates.
I only wish we didn't see Tyr
I like that they finally left all weapons and Mimir's head in the game. It was illogical that Kratos or Dante from DMC somehow lose their stuff. It would vary the gameplay so much since the beginning. Also, Atreus is older that's a dope detail.
I will do anything to play this game although I can’t afford PS5.
This gonna be best game of 2022
This trailer has a very "early 2000s" feel to it. You know, back when game developers were confident enough in their games that they'd just show gameplay, not pre-rendered cinematics
Kratos had flashbacks of really bad things when Atreus said to think like a general
I’m so happy ❤️
I cannot wait for this game, i just cannot
This is what I want Thank you Sony And know I need a PS5 than everything is ok
Kratos: Gets his hands on storm breaker Asgard: I'm in danger
Why did it have to come out now,I don’t have a ps5 yet
Nothing but perfection  and pure bliss...😇
Who’s the girl?!!
Who is that man at end? Looks like zeus
Woah!!!!!!!!!!
Playstation ❤
Kratos didn't say BOY? !!!! 😲
thay should make more dramatic and sad song at start of the trailer its very childish like this
O Fantasma de Esparta volta
يدين امي
Is it coming for PS4 pls let me know.
Ooooooooo Asambawwww Asambawww Behenchooooodhh 🔥🙌
This is why i have a PS5.
Finally I've been aching to fight me some Asgardians. Come one come all.
Me: Only in PS5?  Kratos: YES BOI
DLC , где крутые боссы ? Где крутые локации ?
fun fact :    I haven't playstation
Ля это не увикинги я ошибся )
Boy has hit puberty ladies and gentlemen
Ps4 f...
How many of you are waiting to kratos say ......"BOI..
Ragnarok is coming
Please be in ps4
My body is ready
This looks sick
My man has thought like a general for long enough
the CHILLS. the hype train is real!
It's looks like GOW 2018, not? Just like dlc for big game. But, maybe it's wrong trailer
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Bruh, how tall is that dude towards the end of the trailer? 😳
Someone know title of music in the background?
Angrboda: "You'll get your answer soon enough. Well, some of them."   Yeah, the answer is, get woke, go broke
Best game👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I miss when comments sections weren't just filled with lame and unfunny attempts at memes
Time to dust of my atm card and order a ps5
who is the girl at the end ?
Take my money 💰
Есть тут СНГ ешники?
Absolutely stunningly gorgeous
SANTA MONICA LOVE YOU!
WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!!!!!!
*inserts eggplant emoji*...
epic❤️❤️
Same graphics like the PS4 Pro 60fps.  PS5 is such a big scam.
is it only available for PS5 or is it also available for PS4?
Atreaus voice cracked, guess the boy became a teen, one step to be a man
I watched this 16 times. I got goosebumps 16 times.
And it still looks like a PS4 game
Lol it looks the same 😂
i genuinely hope we get a scene of going in to battle. Like full on soldiers going in to war and kratos at the head it would be unreal
New shield designs?
WOW!!!
Danger is coming. ❄️
will there be a ps4 version of this?
who is the last person who kreatos talk to kim and said you come with us?
GILAAAA, UDH GAK SABARRR ,  yakinnnn bakalllannnn kerenn parahhhhh
"War isn't the only way,"  "Because war,...war never changes."
Hey xbox, where is your gaypass??
I feel like they maybe showed a bit too much.
Ps5 now on my wishlist, this game looks dupe.
Finally 😍😍😍😍😍😍
this should be dlc, not other game, even animation same lol
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person..." Greek Gods : yea you said that right.
So hyped!!!!!
Meh ?
Продолжение 2018 года ничего нового
Kratos doesn’t go for war to help others 🤨
Жизнь говорит надо покупать пс 5
The question is will it run on PS4?
TYR supposed to have one-hand, why he has two-hands?
Insert "shut up and take my money" Futurama gif
Plz Don't kill kratos 😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general"   Kratos Vietnam flashbacks
Finally I've been waiting for another trailer for ages just to see if it's real
RELEASE DATE!!!!!!
Odin , Ragnarok thors axe and hammer . Is this game affiliated by Marvel?
Happy Thor Chathurthy 😁
Pas incroyable graphiquement.... 🤔 elle est où là puissance de la PS5 ?  on dirait un DLC du premier GOW ☹️
Loki isnt a girl 🤦
GOTY! 💙
The fact that they showed Tyr in the trailer means that they have even bigger things to show in the game.
I love how even though Atreus has changed in appearance, he's still adventurous, dare I say petulant and has a little bit of child-like quality to him
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”     Kratos: "Flashbacks of a Kratos destroying an Asgardian like a firework with the blades of chaos"
🔥🔥🔥🔥
can't hear any "boi" :(
And now we buy a PS5 (if stocks are there DUH)
Tyr Sigurd Odin eivor
We can't wait anymore
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  "Yes", Kratos answered calmly.
let go , waiting for this game
Tamil nanbas like here
Это было просто ох**нно!
Let's be real, this was the trailer everyone, that was hyped for the showcase, was most looking foward to!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Who’s the Girl at the end ?
Not looking forward to the Valkyrie equivalent
Teenage Boi's voice is so annoying...
More of the same
Who is that little girl in the last 🤔
Офигеть просто
That just blew my mind
Blak girl in Scandinavian mifology?! 🤦‍♂️
Anyone else get a flashback with kratos and tyr from the last game
I'm kinda dissatisfied if I'm honest, I'd hoped for more changes to gameplay, or even being able to play as Atreus or something.
اويلي حجي كرتوس ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is this the same Kratos who says "The time of the gods have come to the end"
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”   Kratos: “Ask Magni and Modi”
I hope it will be available to PS4
Cool but it looks a lot like the previous game
Totally hyped for this
Plz plz plz kindly this game play also  p s 4 becuse p s 5 is too costly lol
love this ❤️
Wooooooooooooooaaaah
Se ve exactamente igual al anterior.
Come on 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
both have different voice or there's something wrong with my ear??
Ja też czekam śle na STALKERA 2 i trochę sobie poczekam ale już go kupiłem i jest w bibliotece 😁👍
Anyone think the girl at the end looks familiar?
Даже удивительно,что подобные игры выходят до сих пор. Я думал, без ЛГБТ и фемок больше ничего не выпускают! Респект!
Такое ощущение что играли на ps4
To the people who are saying "oh it plays just like the 2018 one" ofcourse it does, u know why ? because if they improve the game so much in term of physics, features, interactions...etc they won't be able to run on that 2010 hardware that the ps4 has, the game got limited by the ps4 console Btw yeah it looks great but if it was a ps5 only game it would've been WAY better that this and so much improved than the 2018 gow Btw I still don't have a ps5 , I only have a ps4 but the truth needs to be said If horizon forbidden west was a ps5 only title it wouldn't have been delayed to 2022
Wow atreus make his bigger. Not call boy anymore, sh's call son!
Let that girl at the end be played by Zendaya
Thỏr to Kratos : ' You seem like a reasonable and calm person ' Zeus and the rest of Greek's gods: ' You dont say '
As an Xbox Player - i wish you a lot of fun with it. I'd love to be able to play that game too
THE HYPE IS REAL
I like Atreus's patronus!
Isit coming out on ps4 aswell?
If Thor is a calm and reasonable person, why is he fat?
Ohhhh it's onnnn 👀🔥
its the guy from fortnite.
wow im glad that all the previous armor sets i worked hard for kratos went into oblivion 🥲
It will be only ps5?
I can't stop watching this. It's absolutely blowing my mind. The graphics, trying to figure out where they are for half the trailer, just WOW. I've never been more excited for a game in my life.
FINNA BE LITTT!!! 🔥🔥🔥
DLC
уууххх ска!!!!!!!!
Kratos is coming for you, Thor
I want to play this now lol
Loki TVA is coming ?
BOI
Ohh Yeah!😁😄🤪
I hope this gamewill be in ps4 soon
For those that are thinking this looks too similar, you do realise Breath of the wild 2 is doing the exact same thing right?
as a next gen pc player this actually makes me sad I don't have a next gen console
🤩😎🤯
I really hope this game is directed the same way as the last one - with the whole game just being one long continuous shot
Vai lok... quer dizer Atreus
Anyone gonna talk about how the wolves are skol and hati?
So it's basically the same game, same charakter models, same weapons, same moveset, same environment, same graphics.
DLC?
The frame rate looks real choppy though, hope there's a 60 fps mode on the ps5.
Waw
Find 10 Differences
"Play has no limits" except for the gaming platform lol
typical African-American woman in Scandinavia)) Have you been dropped upside down as a child?
Wonder how Boy got a buzzcut, they got barbers in Midgard?
That's it I'm pumped😤LES GO
The bess games 2022 wow
WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN?????
Now I finally got an actual reason to buy Playstation 5!!! ❤️
This is only for ps5?
Here is the next Game of The Year prize.
This is just Meh. Fat Thor and outdated graphics(ps4/ps5 cross). Meh
Finally a reason to have PS5
I friggen loved Opie on SOA...this is freaking icing on the cake for me...
Just wow.......
Noice
پشمااام😍😁
Let's gooooooooo
Okay we woke now
Waiting 😎😘😘
It will be interesting when Kratos wields mjolnir
This looks like a dlc expansion.... Why
OH MY DAYS TYR
Finally BOY learned how to hunt deers
Game of the Year!!
Kratos: War is not the only way  Greek Gods: look whos talkin
Adios THOR. With love from KRATOS.
pra mim um dos melhores jogos do pes
💙💙💙
💥💥💥
Just wow can't wait to play
2:34 Did anyone else see Lowki in the back riding the ethereal dear? So cool
I cannot believe the beauty and sharp details of the graphics. This is Santa Monica studios  giving the ps5 a lifeline
Who was that at the end? She was cute. 🙂 Oh, and Kratos is great too. Still waiting on a Goddess of War spin-off game. 😁
I thought it would be Ragnarōk and not Ragnarok.
I hope we don’t get to fight Freya:( she’s one of my favorite characters
This is a Ps5 exclusive, right? No Ps4 version?
Графика уровня Пс4 мдааа
shhheeeeiiitt
I’m not even the biggest GOW fan but ima go play GOW 2018 again 😂
- Thor You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?    - Kratos That all depends on your intentions.
Would be awesome if when they’re riding in boats telling stories Kratos tells Atreus about some of his “adventures” back in Greece
you can't stop this
Looks like a copy and paste game.
حماس
What an age that we r living🙏thanks Sony u do s thing that no one will.and ever again
hate them for beeing ps exclusiv
Tyr has 2 hands, let’s theorize! And where’s his prison, anyway? Asgard?
love from India 🇮🇳
Wiill it be for ps4 to ???
excellent
I know we will probably have to fight Freya but I really don’t want to I love her so much
ENFIN !!!!
Calm and reasonable? His blades are called Blades of Chaos, not blades of serenity.
Esa chica NEEE-GRA del final?  Es una ESCLAVA de los nordicos?
Now THAT'S a trailer
2k dislikes are Thor and Phil Spencer
You have to deserve a game like this
Ooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
🔥🔥🔥
Ready to play on my PS4 because the PS5 is gonna be sold out for a while🤣
Ахуенно
I wanna cry so hard🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks like a better Ac Odyssey .
From atreus to Loki, to Vladimir Putin
EU TE AMO KRATOS
In moments of crisis Panic does nothing.... Harness it, let it serve you...!!!
The fact that Atreus is growing up
A little bit graphic upgrade for in gameplay fire effects should be nice. Love it ❤
Is it just me or does the voice of Thor sound like Josh Brolin( Thanos) ??
so annoying to me that kratos holding back his anger knowing he can just kill all of them for me personally he's a Spartan trying to be something else i understand that he is trying to set a example for his son but after playing all the GOW games I miss his old version
Thor :Are you calm and reasonable person Zeus: You're not that guy pal, trust me you're not that guy.
I'm cu-                  Currently enjoying this trailer for the hard working team that's making this game is brilliant and amazing thank you for you're hard work and take my money
U think Kratos use Mimir as a fleshlight?
BOY!!!!!!!
I guess this kinda destroys the theory, that kratos will loose his arm to fenrir and become tyr.  PS: Im actually here for the mimir content!
Now wayyyyyyyyyyy
@tamil gaming 🔥🔥
Our BOI has grown
lets gooo
Currently at 2.1k dislikes which mean 2.1k people don't have a brain
Kinda wish they left it a surprise Tyr is alive, but cannot wait for this anyway
1:42 If this guy isnt voiced by Danny De Vito then Im not buying it.
Yesssssssss just commenting to make sure I was here
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
Boi
Were there any black women in Norse mythology?
Goosebumps🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What other reveal trailers just have like the entire trailer being pure gameplay lol
Another Black lives matter propaganda game. BOYCOTT.
Punaise vivement qui sort ce jeux il me tarte 😜 vraiment   je suis mort comme guerrier et subit  le sacrifice ultime il mon refusé ma  délivrance
Just Wanna see Kratos in the cinematic universe 😍
Это вам не асассины.
Gritos de perra loca activados 😱
Please we need in PS4 please @Playstation 😢😢
Thor: are you calm and reasonable person Kratos: ever heard of Greek? Thor: No Kratos: EXACTLY
Finally this is happening 💓💓💓💓🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alleine der Soundtrack Gänsehaut Pur
Upcoming Blockbuster Game
thor: are you a calm and reasonable person ?   kratos : circle spam
This will coming out to ps4 as well right?
Tyr!!!
3:05 . Is this now cultural appropriation?🤔 Asking for a Friend.
looks gud.. but truthfully looks a bit too much like part 1.., expected a bigger difference (is it coming to ps4 too??)
the game is getting more boring than ever, miss the old GOW3.
Will it be available on PS4??
3:04 typical scandinavian girl!
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Ask the Greeks.  The Greeks: 💀💀💀
Ну хоть клюшкой для гольфа Кратоса не забили в самом начале, и на этом спасибо.
Holy F**k!? System seller right here boys and girls. Ragnarok, Forbidden West and Spiderman 2. This isn't a console war, It's a console massacre.
the silhouette of artreus at the start looks like a Loki crown
وأخيرًا 😍😍😍😍
Ragnarok papá
I hope they put a Mexican in history because I feel just as excluded 3:04
.The best ever ❤.
This gameplay is masterclass and Atreus wants Kratos to act like a general but Woah.
Ждём Рагнарёк!  Молодой даст просраться  ещё!
Can't wait to hear stories from Mimir while rowing the boat around.
Love it can’t wait hope ps4 also gets the game
Boring and one dimensioned like part 1
I cant wait for this
ok thor now its time to talk with u 1 on 1 😎🤣
This time no training for Ate rus for hunting. Straight food 😋
0:42 yooo its that black and white wolf who eat moon?
I wanna see kratos and tyr armwrestling, gonna break the pantheon
RIP to people who lost there lives due to corona virus and couldn't witness these beauty
R.I.P. Thor.
I’m gonna predict that the wolves on the sled are the wolf giants skoll and hati
Change face kratos and atrus
Thank you Mr.Barlog and Sony for making this amazing game
The fact Thor is voiced by opie from sons of anarchy is amazing
me want play now 😤
I know you are not going to listen to this but please make this game available for PC,it's a humble request SONY
Atreus : Stop talking like a father and start acting like a General!  Kratos : *(vietnam flashbacks) N O ! ! !*
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And that's the reason why PS is 👑 of all gaming stations!
it's the same (( boring
It will be amazing if hela teamed up with kratos and atreus(Loki)
У него сын похож на Максима Мухина из сборной России.
Kratos is back 😎🔥
Return The blade of Olympus please
It’s so beautiful 😍
She will download on ps4 ???
sony Please add Arabic language to the game🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Now we have a reason to buy playstation 5. ( I love thor's voice )
Устрицу мне в зад, это же РАГНАРЕК ИИИИИИИУУУУ
cant wait for thor and odin's head to roll....
Have you got some medicine to reduce the hype 😀? I think It will devouring me
Impazziscoooo che bello non vedo l'ora😍😍😍
Yes!!!
3:04 Not a big corpo game without  diversifying the european myth of course.
Oh oh oh oh oh......     Badass, lovely, cannot wait to play this game, awsm just awsm
Yeeeaaaahhhh!!! I'm pumped up. Can't wait
Tyr's arm ain't ripped off yet? The giant wolf si supposed to take his hands of off ryt
who was the girl in the end
Thalivan Vera level pathu usaru
to see*
So now we have 2 gods of war
I want tonsee odin
These 2 last games have a beautiful and better grafic but I prefer ancient Greece settings, more magical, majestic and inspired. These new games are just wild nature, poor palaces and Gods look like miserable beggars. the Olympians were better and superior than the Norse Gods.
Man, so much to theorize about! 🧐
Can't wait to play 😭😭
He's no longer a BOI  He's a MAN!
Absolute 🔥🔥🔥
Yep… now it’s time to buy a ps5
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Callisto   Zeus   Deimos   Hera Athena  Ares   Persephone  Hercules Atropos Lahkesis Clotho Hephaestus Euryale Hermes Perseus  Minos   Pollux  Lysandra   Calliope  Gaia  Cronos  Hyperion  Mnemosyne   Gyges   Megaera  Aegaeon   Alecto  Tisiphone  Demeter   Hades   Hestia  Poseidon  Orkos  Pandora  Theseus   Pegasus   Triton  Theseus  Polyphemus   Helios  Eos  Atlas  Prometheus   Epimetheus  Thanatos Charon Erinys Magni Mogi Baldur : YES OF COURSE HE IS!
Ok Sony. You have convinced me to buy a PS5! You can stop now.
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Absolutely Loved this.. Was craving for more when the game ended.. This looks Soooo Epic..
Instead of a new game, it is look like a DLC.
I'm gonna be really interested in how the leviathan axe and blades of chaos get downgraded into that rust rimey look you can see clearly at 1:26. Maybe something Freya does? I'd hate for it to not be explained especially with how nicely they looked all upgraded and socketed with runic attacks at the end of GOW 2018
I am waiting for Thor vs Kratos !!
心なしかクソガキが少し大きくなった気がする
น้องบอยเสียงแตกหนุ่มแล้ว
Grafics meeeehhh
Greatest game ever made
รอมานานแล้ว
Tyr
i cant wait
Why does that voice sounds like josh Brolin?? The one who says you seem like a calm and reasonable person
Was that Skoll and Hati pulling the sled?
1:23 did the game open world
IGN got more views
well, time to buy the PS5
This is going to be so sick
3:04    waht is this , another ariel???
No Odyn looking poor
how did kratos lose the grey in his beard? do those apples reverse his age? that would line up with Norse mythology.
the same graphics, the same game assets, the same combat animations, the same boat, the same pesky adopted son... sony, you won't get my money, sorry
That shot of Atreus walking in and his silhouette looks like he has the horns of Lokis armour is awesome.
I have 4 and loved it now this wow
the graphic isn't different from GoW4  it can surely run smoothly on ps4
pc gamer🙂💔
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Depends on how full the rage bar behind me is.
In moments of crisis, he returns.
That girl at the end is she Angrboða?
Nice
I can't wait to fight the TVA in this one
So Freyas managed to break her curse and regained her warriors spirit.
Who is she?? 3:04
PLAYSTATION TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE 😭🙏🙏
Never thought they would show Tyr in this trailer
It's Beautiful   I've Looked At This For Five Hours Now
The boi has grown up so fast 😭😭
Anyone know what the black characters name is at the end.
Почему у Тюра 2 руки??? Волк еще не откусил что ли?
Does this coming to PS4? Or just PS5 exclusive?
I hope the collector's edition will be better for this game.
Looks trash. They are resuing the old map
Sony pulling out so many hype games today
Boi, I can't wait to play this game.
YOOOO KRATOS IS BACK BABY
Animations look identical to the last game  Lazy game devs
is sunny sulcjic still play Atreus he's sound differrent or is it he's just hit puberty LOL
This game is goin be too hard 😈
Let's gooooooooo
I really wanna see Tyr vs kratos now. Two gods of war fighting would be a sight to behold.
Date?
PLS CHANGE ODIN .
Please let it be more fun than the last one. More enemies, real boss fights and not so slow paced, boring repetitve action with no blood.
just one thing Ooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhjhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i just wish you can use your save file from the previous game, so i can still enjoy my level 9 zeus set
Is josh brolin the voice of Thor??
So no release date?
Is it going to be a PS5 exclusive? Because i have a PS5 and am ready for it!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! L3+R3!
Game of The Year already
I hope it have more weapons
❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️❤️👏🏻❤️👏🏻
🇮🇶👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Отлично!
The will be awesome but I thought the graphics would be more enhanced but it's look similar as PS4 graphics . The graphics should be more enhanced for ps5 .
And the cold part about it is that , the game is gonna be totally different from the trailer and for the it's the best thing cz the changes make it even BETTER ...I can't wait for this game 👍💙🧡💪
that girl at the last moment is just for blm thing?
If this gets realeased on pc, like Horizon Zero Dawn...
Ivar-odin is with us Kratos- no more
Cant wait
Game of the year 2021
Hmmm. Can't say I'm hyped for this simply because of the same combat and camera. But I'm optimistic, just don't make the axe turn into a blue lightsaber when max upgraded.
This looks incredible. Can’t wait to play. Loved the whole series from the beginning
meh
Dark skin girl in Norse!?!?!??!? ridiculous
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  "Yes. In fact, let me show you how I calmly and reasonably dealt with Hercules...."
12/10
I'm praying this has more+better boss fights then GOW 2018
I wonder if kratos will now call Atreus young man instead
Finally for a very long time
So it seems im the only one who thinks that its almost the same game.. which is okay cause It was great but maybe i was looking for something more spectacular
I do not when the demo will vome
IM IN LOVE WITH THISSSSSSS
Starting to feel like Witcher 3 and Gears of War. Which is not a bad thing!
Orrendo è uguale a quello del 2018
Awww there is n for Ps4?
Who is this tall Peter person at the end?
NO PREORDERS!
😍
2:12  Man The Joy I had there
Thor : " are you calm and reasonable person?" Kratos : "you should ask my father but.."
Who is the huge guy at the end?
Кайф!🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌👍👍👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪🌍🇹🇯🇷🇺
That Thor hammer tho can't wait to play with that
my boi tyr is huge
Xfans are crying to their moms
Where is boi ?
Oh this is amazing🤩
This game is going to be perfection
Been a fan since 2005. I'm definitely pre-ordering GOW5.
خربت السلسلة من الجزء الرابع 💔  الله يطيح حضج سانتا مونيكا
1:35 look at the *AXE* 😂😂😂😂😂
i watched it like 10 times
disappointed, it looks like a DLC for the last GoW game, there are literally no graphical improvents to be seen. this whole cross-gen time period is killing me
Far Cry 6 has way better character designs
What does this still look like a ps4 game tho?
Shut up and take my money 💰💰💰💰💰
My BOY IS A MAN Jacksepticeye will say
A decade ago, I would've laughed at the idea of imagining Kratos as the calm, reasonable guy pushing for peace. Yet here we are... The man's truly come a long way.
So why did they spoil the fact that Tyr is alive and you meet him in game?
broooooooooo
Inb4 loki recruits kratos to save the timeline
Yay, I get to pay for the same game twice!
Yes.
Why is nobody talking about the black girl in the Norse setting? A teaser into the next mythological setting maybe? Egypt? She certainly had the hair and the clothing for it.
Is this coming out for the ps4 since ppl can't get there hands on a ps5
This game is going to be the GOTY for Sure.
Atreus voice seem off. Anyone else?
The way the music matches up with the hits as the trailer ends😭😭😭😭😭😭
I knew tyr was alive
did i see king shark in there? Anyone else?
I thought since the avengers defeated Thanos Thor would’ve lost a little weight but i guess not🤦🏽‍♂️
Boring to Slow
बिग फॅन
HOT DAWMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
People who chose new Xbox are probably crying rn
3:04 that girl might be Angrboda the prophesied wife of Loki
THEORY: that girl at the end could pass as Egyptian. Are they hinting at future games being set in Egypt where we'll get to see Kratos and Atreus (or possibly just Atreus) take on the Egyptian pantheon?
Estou prestes a me matar, é uma pena q eu nunca va jogar esse jogo
Wow wow wow! Eagerly waiting on this one
Legend
Buying a PS5 then....
When will the game get released??
Мне просто интересно в скандинавской мифологии были негры? Или это как-то сюжетом подкрепят? Если нет я буду очень разочарован
Let's go CHAMP
Not to sound negative but, why does it look literally no better than the previous installment? Atreus' voice is also annoying.
I love the foreshadowing at the beginning with Atreus silhouette in the distance resembling Loki's traditional portrayal
I loved it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😩😩😩
⚡❄️🔥
*ESTO* *VA* *ESTAR* *BUENO*
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that very cooooooiooooooool
Has anyone else notices that atreus did the same thing as Kratos did in gow 4 at 0:23?
This is truly STUNNING GUYS !
Da best
Freya is here!
0:43 Skoll and Hati? Now that's true Ragnarok
Ah yes
it looks more like a dlc and less like a next gen sequel...
PS4 ???
YALL ARE PLAYING WITH MY LIFE
RIP to those GOW fans that didn't have chance to experience this trailer
"War isn't the only way"  The Greek gods: yeah, about that....
THE BEST
Jaram się 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄☄☄☄☄☄
Shame they took away all Dwarfs visual weapon upgrades
This is just incredible! The game will be a blow in Playstation world.
This 3.17 minute has changed my life!!!  I wonder what will happen when this game gets released. BTW does this game have any month for releasing??
Amazing viking game
Is it gonna release on ps4?
Graphics look same as the ps4 one, they copy pasted the same assets rofl
Pls be on ps4
Ah man, the over the shoulder camera again?
Why gta 6 not coming 🥺
*BOI*
Ну хоть в конце негр появился... фух
Shhhhheeeeeeessssssshhhh
get hype!
gameplay seems a bit too similar
i dont have a console but THIS IS LIIITTT
0:57 Freya: fighting her hardest Kratos: yeets* her
If only I can get a ps5 😠
Uhm... maybe the girl at 3:05 is Sigyn?
Let’s not forget that in the prophecy Loki kill Kratos
Is that a whitetail buck in the beginning ?
I went through a relationship waiting for this moment
All of you just think where did they found kentaureus?
Dad Of Boi Ragnarok
BOY
HYPE
Yes yes yes yes yes yes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
IM GONNA PASS OUT 🏃💨
carai sony libera esse jogo pra pc , porfavo meu sonho joga isso , eu nao me importo em paga 300$ nesse jogo
The 2k dislikes is come from odin and his army
Loki
Puberty really hit Atreus huh, lol
Another sassy black girl.
wait ?! no release date !! come on
Unfortunately, I expected more than that
♥️♥️
boy
Oh boy hyped for this game…sad that this is the last game in this franchise but ik it will be a epic masterpiece…LETS GO!!!!
well I'm sad that I can't play this game.
very nice dlc from a 2018 game, with more content, a bit of graphic impovement and same animations. Launch date? nothing at all
🔥🔥♥️
Ah my mans got some base in his voice now
OH MY GAWD, OH MY GAWD THIS IS FRICKING AWESOME I CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS GAME 💯💯💯💯💯 THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER NO CAP🧢
thor is out for kratos as i recall in the ending cutscene in the last game
الأسطورة عادت
BOYYYY
Lemme has this and a ps5 plz
The only reason i buyed Play Station 5 :)))
We love you PS4
“Coming to playstation consoles” does that include ps4?
Мда, оддон к предыдущей части за фуллпрайс, в котором даже модельки не поменяли. Спасибо, не в этот раз, Человека Паука хватило
Winter is coming ..
They keep arguing 😂
How come no one realise the dude traveling down to Kratos with the Bifrost was an Asgardian??
Kratos returns!! 🔥🔥
Here Take my money 💵💵
Can’t wait
Game play waiting for you  KRATOS vs THOR 😎😎😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those wolves kratos has could be a reference to Hati and Skoll, the two wolves that chase the sun and moon?
1:15 Huginn and Muninn 🐥🐥 Odins Ravens that act as his eyes. Likely there will be multiple instances where we see 2 ravens flying off.
why Tyr has two arms ?
Who else is excited for the upcoming game??
3:05 you know these black Scandinavian gods... Did Netflix have a hand in the game?
Ez GOTY 🔥
Looks like DLC to GOW4
Yesssssssss
Fat Thor is Pathetic. 🤦🏻 Especially Thor.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?   Kratos: *Vietnam flashbacks*
bout time
We are waiting for loki transformation
Calling it Game of the year when it comes out
I don’t think this is Tyr. He still has both his arms here, while we know one of Tyr’s arm got bitten by Fenrir in the last game.
Goosebumps 😃
ΤΟ ΘΕΛΩ ΤΩΡΑΑΑ
EPICCCC
Please make this game have a limited edition PlayStation console preferably a PlayStation 5 it's only tradition right of Sony to do like come on
Boi's all grown up.
Thank you Sony! Thank You Santa Monica Studios!
where are tge Greeks
Extraordinary fantastic mind blowing😍 1no.
BOOOOYYYYYYYYY.....DONT CRY.
Let’s goooooooooo
The analogy between GoW (2018) and Ragnarok at the beginning is so cool: In GoW (2018) Kratos orders Atreus to hunt “in the direction of deer” and goes with him to support. In Ragnarok, Atreus returns from a solo hunt, with a deer. What a cool motif!
На ПК не будет как я понимаю?
Atreus looking awesome as always, hopefully there’s a bit where we play as him. Also, 50€ says the girl in the end and Atreus are gonna get together or have feelings for eachother.
The same exact game as the previous one... Repetitive
I still dont like Loki, i dunno, it really feels like an awful character design, also hes ugly.
Eh
Xbox: Im sorry  PS: Do not be sorry, Be Sony
forbidden west + ragnarok + gran turismo = RIP xbox x series
The actual reason Thor was more or less the only person who could weild Mjolnir had nothing to do with worthiness. It's just raw strength. And we know how stupidly strong Kratos is. So, I'm hoping we'll eventually use the hammer.
2:48 2 Gods of War working together  This is gonna be fun
My only concern is that the ps4 version won't hold baxk the ps5 version
Ahhhh finally 😍
Witcher 4 looks nice.
Man, I can't wait to watch the cutscenes on YouTube when this releases
Am I the only one who expected that in this trailer we will get the glimpse of Odin and Odinson????
😢♥️
Xbox just wrap it up
LET THE HYPE BIGINS
Finally Sebastian
They cheated us on the graphics. No one will say it but they did.
I'm excited..... and wet!!!!!
1:45 blades of chaos
Tyr still has his hand :D
"Are u a calm and reasonable person???" - I guess thats the voice of the one who wields "mjolnir"
Atreus: "Stop acting like a father and start acting like a General!"  The entire fandom: takes a deep breath "BOI."
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: looks at Spartan rage meter
This game is gonna be on a whole nother Tyr of amazing.
Verithanama Iruke Thalaivaa Kratos 🔥🔥🔥 Waiting For Ragnarok.....
La traigo bien parada
Is it coming for Ps4 as well?
Is it come on ps4 also ?
Here's hoping they don't pull a "Neil Drukkman Card" on us.
Can't wait to Play 😋😋😋
whoa  angrboda is black. Reminds me of the black Heimdall.
I hope we get a lot of Greek aswell. I would love one of the older weapons
PS 4 ?
Вы показываете скандинавскую мифологию и даже туда негров пихаете. У вас всё в порядке?
People that disliked this WHATS WRONG WITH YOU???
Looks like we got some new enemies here: Frog men, Deer men, a giant crocodile thingy that moves like a cheetah, probably light elves this time and what I'm guessing to be Asgardian troops . Don't know much about Norse Mythology, so if anyone knows what they are, feel free to enlighten me. Though I'm secretly hoping we get Berserkers in the game as well.
Boy?
Got to get that woke bit in right at the end..... sheeeez.
We've waited for a long time for this 🔥
Kratos looks smol
Man again it looks like playstation 4 wasn't supposed to look playstation 5 like common guy s are they tired on giving the best designs
0/10 he didnt say "boi" once
tall boi
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
Excited to see how they do Heimdall, seeing he and loke is destined to kill eachother at ragnarok
Notice how Atreaus in the beginning of the trailer hunted the deer on his own this time? He's growing up.
2:34 Loki in the background.
Who is she?
THE HYPE TRAIN IS HERE
O deus da guerra está de volta.
NO!
OK we get it, you're gonna get game of the year!
les apesto la vrga a los de santa monica otra maldita obra de arte
That's the reason I'm gonna buy PS5!!!
PS4 User ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Oh Boy!
So nobody is gonna talk about that possibly being Calliope at the end of the trailer.
ARE YOU COMING WITH US
Is that a centaur!?  Are there centaurs in norse mythology!?  Did some monsters from Greece migrate to Midgard!?
YOOOO WHATTTTTT??
Are those centaurs?
Was that Calliope 🤯
Tyr has red and green pants Oh come on
2:12 That enemy just teleported from Asgard through the bifrost.... The Asgard is hunting kratos and atreus 🔥
Looks like Freya got over her aversion to fighting. I wonder how
😎
That pretty much all I wanted was a showdown between Thor and Kratos and Freya and Kratos. Seems like we're getting them! I'm even more hyped lol
I'd Thor will arrives
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: ask zesus...
*Kratos after defeating Thor* "THAT'S IT I'M GETTIN ME MALLET"
Kratos can still kill him (the tall guy).
How am I supposed to play when I cant get a PS5 🤔
WHY IS ANGRBRODA BLACK???????? SHE'S A JOTUNN FOR THOR's SAKE. A FROST GIANT
They are in Europe mytho and there’s a black girl… they better have gone to Africa.
*R E A D* *I T* *B O I*
This is next level gameplay
Тянет на DLC, но не на сиквел
This is going to be the best game in history ❤️🔥
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" All the olympian gods in the afterlife: "Pfff"
I think it’s Odin that’s says the reasonable person not Thor
No Blood??? Old Kratos is the best
The boy cracked his voice. But that spartan still look the same
Why are they culturally appropriating Nordic peoples?
So funny thing, Cory Barlog always described the Æsir gods as “bikers”. Thor’s voice actor is one of the cast members of “sons of anarchy”
Did Atreus get a new VA or is it still the same VA?
Can't wait to play this game it is cooler then GOW4
I really hope it’s not some woke wannabe trash like how tlou 2 ended up.
Me : "Wha ..." Trailer : 3:01  Me : 😳
How could Kratos say such a thing? war is not the only way
What's the point, there aren't enough playstation 5s to buy. Plus you guys are keen on making another jet engine by cutting the size of heatsink.
Oh my BOI!!!
О господи, как я жду продолжения. Мать родную продам, но куплю GoW Ragnarok
The Best)
Can this be on ps4
Даже в нордическую мифологию умудрились негра всунуть и сделать на этом акцент в конце трейлера.
CAN'T WAIT FOR  RAGNAROK
У меня аж привстал))
I am so bying this game the second it's out...
Fhinish
The best game in the world ! Kratos is coming !!!!!!!
ВОЗЬМИТЕ БЛЯДЬ МОИ ДЕНЬГИ!!! (Atreus riding on his fantasies is cool)
Op
Atreus hit puberty
music 2:12 ?
EPIC!
Tyr knows what kratos did to greek pantheon. It's gonna be interesting to see them together.
if it was also directed by ccory barlog this game can became an legend game now it is also legend
OOOOOOOOOOOOOMMIODDIOHHHHH
3:04 иiger ?
Will this one actually be open world or the same pretend open world with reskinned bad guys over and over and stupid throwing axes at bells for stuff.  Looks the same to me.  Glad I didn't waste money on the PS5 with the amount of nothing coming out for it.
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
Banger 🔥
Is it Wakanda at the end of the video?
*Есть тут российские зрители, которые ждут эту игру так же сильно как я ?*
Que increíble después de un año de ausencia nos sorprenden con esto me e enamorado completamente si ya de poesía el primer juego fue increíble ahora me imagino este va estar selestial 😎😁
Chain shouldve been thicker
Ps4🤗
Kratos : Are you coming with us ? Tyr : Just wait I want to show you my height.
😭😭😭😭😭
so great,  perfect, amazing and unique  🥰🌟❤
Santa Monica nigdy nie zawodzi
Dio canaglia de dio...
Did they change the voice actor for Artemis? And Kratos too?   I don't want that to happen! Christopher Judge is so beautiful as Kratos.
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a gene... Kratos: NO!!
Couldn’t forget the token black child at the end, because without one how could you possibly show this game to modern audience who won’t even buy the game but still judge you…😑
Game of the Year...."GOW Ragnarok”❣️🔥
Trailer looks great but graphics don’t look like they changed since PS4 game though.
That girl at the end😩😩😩
BOY 🎒
Non PlayStation users crying right now
Looks like the ps4 game
Aterus: stop acting like a father and start acting like a general.  OH BOY, WHAT A QUOTE.
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Atreus: “Yep, ask your son, Magn- oh, my Dad”
Top TYR !!!!!
This is going to be alot better then the new gta5 version
The standing up, reminder that Kratos has wiped out those that stand above him before
Resposta direta ao governador Dória.dacunha na escuta
3:06  kratos be like  now thats my boy
Two Gods of war.
I just love that line  “Are you a calm and reasonable person?”
I can't wait!!
I love you playstation
Oh boy! Excited!  Hoping to see boy with a nice beard but he's perfect as he is nonetheless.
Chains: yes!!!!
Never heard of it
Waaaaaaw 🤩
Can't wait for this.
THIS LOOKS INSANE
Ngl the graphics look exactly the same as PS4. This is what happens when you decide to make the game cross gen instead of making it a PS5 exclusive.
❤🌟🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This better be a ticking DLC. Not a new game.
Santa Monica please take my money
One thing for sure If atreus is Loki mean kratos is tyr but in different myth but they share the same fate only tyr cant find ot solution
gassed
Now is just wait a couple of years to buy my PS5
короче тоже самое
The trailer sucked
BOI has grown but I was hoping he’d be much bigger. Beard. Gruff but well built. Now he’s like annoying teenage Spider-Man with Loki-ness curiosity. Well… I can’t wait!!!!!
Play stump 5 be like unlimited scalpers be like don’t think so 😂😂😂
Saying "Ragnarök" in English makes it sound so lame in comparison to Swedish 😫
I am very excited this game
When does it come out?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🤯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😍😍
Тотальная инклюзимность в экзах Сони, то чего я так боялся и вижу не напрасно.
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person?   Kratos : My main weapon is a pair of blades which is fueled by blood and emits fire and YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I'M CALM?
DLC
Only PS5? 😭
So the BOI hits puberty huh....😂
The best
Goosebumps!
This is gonna be the greatest fvcking game of my generation along with Spider-Man 2
this game is just a rip off from marvel hero
Action boy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ATREUS  MY SON HAS GROWN
حماس حماس حماس 👍
Tyr Do be a BIG boy  Can already tell cory barlog and the rest of the development team did an excellent job this game is going to be magnificent can't wait
Help I’m having a stroke
Que extraño
BOI
I am waiting this game
Thor : "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos : 'Perhaps"
В смысле мужчина сильнее женщины, аяяй, что-то не по "канонам" нынешней повесточки)))
Thor: “Are you a Calm and Reasonable Person?” Kratos: “Does your Hammer requires *Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price.”*
I did not expect a sequel so soon!
Finnaly
New Combos
Another game of year is ready   Well done Santa Monica 💪💪💪💪
I'm waiting for you  "Kratos" .
move over Lady Dimitriscu, the new tall hottie Tyr is coming through
Meh feels like a DLC nothing new
Meh.....
Can't wait to see Odin even though probably we'll not fight him in this second chapter but in the third (yes, i expect this to be a Trilogy).
I love that Kratos is so short compared to Tyr.
Ecuador presente.
Shut up and take my money 😆😆😆😆😆
AYO SONY IMA NEED THIS GAME EARLY YO! Literally 2 nanoseconds after it drop you'll hear a faint clear ch-ching sound in the back.
Thor: are you a calm reasonable person?   Kratos: idk dude ask your children and brother??
Давно пора
this game looks so well that it doesn't even need a ''trailer'' like others game do,just pure gameplay.
The more i look the trailer, the closer i get the game.
WOOOOOW!, ME QUEDARE CON ESAS GANAS DE JUGAR POR NO TENER LA PLAY 5:(
Xbox players are really Quiet right now 👀
this is awsome but i doubt ill be able to get a ps5 before this comes out🤦‍♂️
Super
So.. who blew the horn?
Lady dimitrescu who?
He will be in ps4?
Ps4?
My game is coming 😍
As usual this is cool
بڕۆ ڤانە خۆتی xboxکێە 😂
POG
The Best
Game of the year of 2022 is ⬆️
A little let down. Looks like an expanion for GoW 2018, but will be a sure buy  👌
Amazing! Take my money now👏🔝
:D :D :D  Basically my reaction throughout. I would've thought Atreus would be aged up a bit more. He still whinges a lot lol. Also, i guess people's theories about Tyr being Kratos were wrong lol. Interesting. Now we'll see where the road leads.
🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🥺🥺🥺finally
El comentario español que esperabas : Cae de salida si o si.
It will come on ps4 too
Fortnite
Noooooo :( where is the old voice of atreus?! 💔
I’m only buying the ps5 for this master piece
Think they're gonna sneak in a boss fight with Hela?
Why does Thor sound like Josh Brolin 😂
What's that monkey doing there?
I want thor to be an extremely hard or indestructible one :D
Lore kratos vs cosmic armor superman 😂
im so excited to play this game
For any Sons of Anarchy fans, that's Opie playing Thor.
ааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааа
Хочу Ps5 только ради этой игры
Lezz gooo
He sounds like Teal'c in this trainer more than anything else!
Josh brolin ???? ffs ... Im excited........ ♥️♥️♥️
Ps4?
2:35 look at atreus
Just imagine if it was old kratos he always thinks like a general.. 😂
Welp, looks like it's time to replay GOW4 again! maybe I'll even beat that stupid valkyrie queen...
oh he's hand still complete
I will buy ps 5 soon!
Atreus hit Puberty
Boy
I did not think I could get this hyped about a game anymore. Can't wait to play this game, it looks amazing!
My most anticipated game of all time, looks amazing
Hope it's not calliope am seeing at the end of the trailer
My effing eyes are melting....with joy 😊
wowwwwww
You say Ragnarok but no FENRIR. Where is FENRIR?
Me he aburrido hasta el tráiler..... Me parece más de lo mismo, por no decir que tiene los mismos gráficos que en PlayStation 4 para que me he comprado una Playstation 5 para esto???
thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?? ME:laughing in corner kratos: are you kidding me
I hope jacksepticeye makes a playthrough of this
Can't wait
This is should be called *GODS OF WAR* With tyr as a playable character.
Ok. MAYBE I’ll get a ps5
basura de juego
Watch. Your. Tone. *Boi*
I wish thor had an Accent and Atreus is going through puberty i see.
Tyr is an absolute unit
Oooh my!
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: “And I took that personally”
The only reason why I got a PlayStation.
Atreus:- you should not think like father think like general All OG players:- GET THIS BOI A PS3
Game Of The Year AGAIN
Bonjour
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goty asegurado
Is Josh Brolin voice for Thor ?
I have always been in doubt whether this is the original Playstation channel or not.
Goosebumps after watching the video
Black people in norse mithology, how accurate of course! Stop insulting people's intelligence and using a race as a token, please! it's getting ridiculous
And this is why you buy a ps5 instead of a Xbox
1:47 *GET OVER HERE*
Only ps5 😭
Yep, black girl in scandinavian fantasy setting. Totally authentic!
Best Adventure Game ever created! Thanks Santa Monica Studios 🙏🏻
When i see loki with his antlers i was wet, and when i saw it was an antler i was still wet for the foreshadowing
2:42 he can finally open the door.
I love all your works, SCE Santa Monica Studio!
Why does Tyr have both his arms?
Angrbođa
Goddammit, how are we gonna be able to wait for this masterpiece
I bet that girl at the end of the trailer is an Egyptian goddess of some sort. You may recall, we were teased the fact that the Egyptian mythological pantheon exists within this continuity in the last game.
Nothing new :((((
This is the only game i cared about on playstation.
Уверен это будет великолепная игра, и все равно они впихнули сюда темнокожую женшину, бля в скандинавии небыло темнокожих
Who's the girl at the end
someone just entered puberty xD
Is that Artemis ???
😎
Y'all weird
Is this the same voice actor as the other game for Kratos? Pretty bad.
This reveal is really underwhelming. It doesn't have even nearly the same amount of pull that the previous one had. No cinematic quality whatsoever. It's something to be really worried about. If they can't even pull off the cinematic aspect in a reveal trailer, how would they do it in the game itself through the gameplay and cutscenes? Changing the director seems like a really bad mistake now.
Quiet boy ran through my head.
Egyptian Mythology is next !!!
You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: haha spartans rage goes brrr
1.7 M in 9 hours!   F for respect
They really used the same map 😭😭😭
Are you a calm and reasonable person.  - ну типа
Can’t wait to fight some Asgardian warriors and Thor himself
Goosebumpzzz
HOLY S..T. DOPE.
Guess I now have a reason to get a PS5.
💫🔥😥
Откуда негры в Асгарде?
Can’t wait to hear more Mimir stories
Aww yeeess these memes will do.

Ok. So who's the black chic?
I am an XBOX guy here, but hold-up this S*#%T is real 🔥 It`s time anyone with an old PS5 to spare?
Ok game... Nothing new here. Going to play once its on some cheap sale 2years from now.
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE WAITING FOR
Это. Просто. Офигенно!
Para soniers recalcitrantes

No release date is fine by me. I waited a year for this trailer and I wasn't disappointed!
Is it going to be on ps4
Oh man. This is going to be epic! I can't wait.
Graphics😳😳😳😳
This seems like picking up right from where we left off. Literally, like the same game. Not that I am complaining as it was THE BEST game of the PS4. Can't complain with more of the same
0:24 from shadows it looks loki is wearing a helmet
I cried
Es la voz de tom holland?
And many People still wondering why Sony is the best option 🙄.
PS4 Graphics on PS5. Nice 🤣
This best thing seen all except for Spider-Man trailer for ps5
Freya looks so Badass
Game of the year again?! I hope it
WHO ARE YOU I AM FROM ANCIENT GREECE!
Kratos is becoming more and more like Santa Claus. We are waiting for the developers to come up with adventures for him, where the harsh Spartan will gradually become a favorite of children.
so now thor, next game Odin.. then Egypt?

Best game ever.
"act like a general" me: Boi you made a bad choice of words

Please release in 2021

Looks like it's based on the same engine like last one was ..hmm I was hoping for more
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos: “hold my blades of chaos.”
It better be 60fps
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" * presses L3+R3 *
Pp hard

Yo why does Thor sound like Josh Brolin?
Music sounds very Witcher-ly
This is DLC?

Bro me and my bro watched this together and the both of us have nutted so hard when we saw the trailer
The girl seems like americans or mongolians
Both war gods…..awesome
Im not sure how this will work with the weapons. I have unlocked all skills in GoW. So in this game, will we have to unlock the skills all over again?
Afro Ninja approved 🥷🏾🤙🏾

Playstation Pls dont make the game very costly i reallu want to get it, Its my dream to play this game
I think or Athraya's voice is like Fin's voice frome the "Adventure time"

Kratos stole Thor's Strombreaker Asgard; The war begins
Once upon a time were a rival called Xbox, but is no more
Ahh, Mimir. Glad to see you
I sense a Atreus or Kratos Boss Fight in the coming future
I wonder if we'll get access to travel to all the realms now. GOW is just so mind blowing.
I have watch this trailer 5 times already!!! and probably will watch another 5 times!!! I'm so look excited about this game!!! Can't wait to play it!!
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Greetings to you guys and girls  . Ragnarok  This is the best Ive seen😍
3:05 🤯
Game of the Year 2022 Is Here
Hey
Can't wait to see Tyr and Kratos in action
😆😆😆😆😆😆💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥70 dollars pay while you are silent on a copy and paste game for me the previous part is nothing new in personal motion graphics with the camera
They really got Josh Brolin to voice Thor ? 😂 this looks EPIC!!!
Even the trailor has the full potential to give next level of goosebumps, Just think about the full game!!!!!!
i think there would be ragnarok 2
“The PS5 has no games.”  The PS5:
Aff esse moleque enche o saco no jogo, cadê o kratos raiz ?
Жду очень жду я 4 часть 2 раза прошел
GOTY
Yaaaa Ragnarok IS coming
what if we get to yeet thor's hammer after killing him ? im so fkn excited
Ahhh can't wait
Literal Chills !!! ❤️🔥
Well, time to buy a ps5 lol
Got some mad Hercules v Kratos vibes off that tyr stare down he gave to old man Kratos
Я не впечатлился 🤔 ждал большего
0:21 I see what you did there Santa Monica...disguising the deer over Atreus to make him look like Jotunn
Ok now im in hype
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?   Kratos: *L3+R3* oh for sure! 😀
I'm guessing the two wolves on the sled are Skoll and Hati. So hyped Tyr is in this, love the jewels in his eyes for continuity.
BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY!
All hail cretos.. Defeat Thor..
Can't wait to play this game. for answer also. I wish there's a special PS5 theme console for this game.
Eu te amo Kratos 😍❤️
the horn of a deer in the begining foreshadowing loki iconic outfit
Ok sold

Can this runs ps4 slim
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *gets GOW 3 flashbacks* Yeah about that…
Mjolnir!!
TAKE MY MONEY! 😍
ЧЁРНЫЕ В СКАНДИНАВИИ?!
Can we already give them game of the year reward ?
that was the quickest 3 mins of my life 😭
Is this for only ps5 if  yes that’s cool
Angrboõa to Loki: You’ll get your circle button soon enough. Well, some of them.
Oigan Tyr debería faltarle una mano según la mitología
2:46 The way Kratos is talking to Tyr is like they're old friends or they know each other
Will it be on ps4
wow wow
Top, maravilhoso, muito foda
OK ITS HAPPENING EVERYBODY STAY CALM!!!!!
Time to buy ps5 when the game release
Mimir writing with his mouth is the best thing I've ever seen
@mokka commentry

Ps4 got it or not?
At the beginning i thought it was Heimdall
Incredible
HyPE
Dlc ))?
Can anyone explain to me who is Thyr is???
Who was the guy at the end??
Kratos: Are you coming with us..?  Tyr be like:  Sure son, let me get up...
Please dont kill kratos off thankyou
I had so many goosebumps watching this that I think I turned into a goose.
black girl in Scandinavia haha
maybe I'll be able to get a ps5 by then
Yeah thats the game i was eagerly awaiting for.
I waiting for the PC version. It will be awesome.
I am waiting for this game 😍😍😍😍
It’s game pass game?
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Microsoft:  [panic, 🔥, pandemonium] runs out the room wailing
Hey, boy
Wow beautiful 😍

Christopher Judge and Thor... All we need is O'Niell
Boy is no longer a boy
Zendaya 3:10
FINALLY
My body is ready
bom demais juniu
will kratos get more weapons?
Emm i dont think there is a black girl in a scandinavian mythology...
Thor: Are you a calm and a reasonable person??? Kratos: Ask "Zeus".
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos nervous sweating Previous Gods: "Yea, about that......"
Yeahhh!!!
How the F am I going to sleep RN 😩😩😩💙💙💙
definitely gonna buy it as soon as it comes out
So a perfect game
Atreus: "Stop acting like a father and start acting like a General!"  The entire fandom: *takes a deep breath "BOI."*
BOY.
THOR: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  KRATOS: L3 + R3
The kid is so annoying he shouldn't be in the game
Its very sad that its last game.
War with Asgard😭😭😍😍
Why does it look like the old game
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" And I took that personally
Wow just wow
TG and A2d fans
🤤😻
❤️💙🖤
After seeing Thors design, those sausage fingers make total sense @2:10
WHEN, WHEN I SAY
Yooooooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boi!!
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
I can't wait
You. Yeah you. Stop reading the comments and pay attention to the video, your missing it.
Cant wait to get my hands on this beauty
Guess the people who theorized that Tyr was a future version of Kratos must feel pretty stupid right now huh?
Kratos is Olympus.. kratos in asgard.. kratos in Egypt.. kratos in go on..go on..go on 🙂🙂🙂
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I would like to say that the scene with Kratos and Atreus walking towards the enemy was straight up badass. PLUS this game looks 🔥🔥🔥
កូនធំជាងមុន
I have never played a single GOW and now I'm gonna play GOW on my PS5 and then this.
Now I wish I had a ps5. TwT
THE BEST TRAILER OF THE YEAR!
I what this ❤️🔥
I am looking forward too this, even though the game series doesn't really care about doing the Mythology right anymore.
Kratos💙
THIS MAKES ME HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Wowowoowowowowowo Very op
Release date?
Yo no se que será de mi futuro la  verdad no tengo ni idea, pero si es necesario escapar de latino América para tener mi ps5 para jugar estooo soy capaz de matar a macri para lograrlo... PD soy de Argentina obvio
I want to play it now can't wait!
Trash
Wish it was made around ps5 ngl. Remnant and other non flagships should have been ps4 too cause it ain't that big of a name
Can't wait to get hands on it
The hands of death cannot defeat me, Freya could not hold me and you will not see the end of this day. I will have my revenge!  - Kratos
i need a ps5 asap
Are you a calm and reasonable person ? Aphrodite: not quite calm, but reasonable, uh huh
Game of the century 😱😱😱😱😱
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general"  OG players: "BOI"
My finger are twitching for playing my favourite game of all time
Why do people keep saying Thor's quote like a question? He says "You seem like a calm and reasonable person" as a statement.
Did kid's voice actor change? Or only sounds more 'matured'?
Hyped af
I literally just finished kenichi’s ragnarok arc 2 todays ago, this is fate
Master piece as always
Mass ❤️👌
nice.
Release date please
Thor: "Are you calm and Reasonable person?" kratos: L3+R3 kratos: "Sure"
I think we’re heading outside of the Norse realms in this one. Some of the stuff in this trailer, like those trees at 1:48 or the girl at end, look foreign. This is gonna be far more interesting than any of us could’ve imagined. I am hyped!
Copy & paste game
Black little girl is ODIN....
Is it playable on ps4?
Calm and reasonable person 😂😂
2024
Ps4 is holding this back. At least 60fps should be applicable on the PS5
I do not care, i do not carece about any ps5 or ps4 games , because i gave up , y been trying to buy a ps5 and is impossible, Shame on you sony
Will ragnarok come to ps4 Please answer
Atreus has grown up
Is this real?
Looks great, but nothing will ever top my hype for Elden Ring
More of same
The boy, is no longer a boy.
Boy. ....
Viva el dios kratos y el boy de nuevo carajo!!! ❤️
Don't tell me that they traveled to Asgard
lesssss gooooooo
I got reason to buy PS5 now
2:49 my pp when I see a hot girl
Tyr also has Bifrost crystals for eyes
جماعت اكس بوكس ليش تخلون دس لايك 😂😂😂
Looks the same
This game is gonna get another game of the year award
Whenever I winning an argument against my father. Father last resort: 1:56
This is just what we all need
Tyr still has both hands here it seems, not yet bitten of by Jormungandr.
198 gigs?
Looking forward to this . Look forward even more to actually having a PS5 to play it on
Thor: Are you seem calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: well yes, but actually No.  *press Circle*
The graphics seem just like they were on PS4 gow, hope they improve before release now that others have stepped up their game .
I can't wait now 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Current Objective: Survive
Anyone else bothered by American accents on games based on non American culture?
Another game i can't afford
Give me my money lol
Waw sudah tidak sabar untuk memainkannya
dont kill thor kratos!!!marvel need him
Puro ingleses xd
Tyr makes Kratos look like Tyler1
3:05 GIRL
se me hizo agua la cola
Same repetition of gow 2018 not impressed. A slowed down, watered  down version of Kratos in a Norse mythology universe that just doesn't match him. Same dull atmosphere like the last game. 👎
They added more npc in the town  Me: free exp time.
2:01 is it just me or does he sound like josh brolin
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Oh man Thor is hype.
No PC version again. They are really trying to release the worst quality versions of their games.
yo digo que también lo saquen en la plataforma maestra
who else got goosebumps like me after hearing that background sound  🥶
They could not resets adding a “strong diverse female character” smh
Yooooooo
Were there any black people I'm the norse mythology?. Also, that thor isn't intimidating at all....
Craaazzyyy how they are making game for the fortnite character
This really made me want a great pirates game in a similar style
Blacks in Scandinavia! Are you seriously?
This will release on ps4 too ryt?
More like a dlc
WHY I NeEd ps4 on this game pls
is this just a better assassin's creed valhalla.....
Legend is back 🖤
Tyr's kinda... suffering from PTSD.
Lol Thor sarcasm is crazy as he’s reaching for his hammer
Maybe the little girl at the end was Angrboda Mother of Monsters🧐? Will She and Loki create Fenrir and Jormungandr?!
Atreus: Tyr. Kratos: Atreus! Tyr: Boi?
More boat and possibly sled stories
Setelah kratos membantai dewa dewi olympus, sekarang waktunya kratos membantai dewa dewi nordik
L. Ron Hubbard?
finnaly my life has mening again
"are you a calm and reasonable person"  kratos: WHAT!?
Me: Will there be more PS5 in coming months? Perhaps Christmas? Little girl at the end: You’ll get your answer soon enough… well some of them 🙂
Goose bumps
Ohmygod!
Прикольно конечно, но наличие члена негроидной расы в игре про скандинавскую мифологию это такое себе. Тюр шикарный получился.
Hype
💜💜
Well Atreus changed a lot.
😍
EPIC!!!!
Estará para ps4?
Ебаа́аааааааааать. Норм епат
You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Zeus: yeah he is.
Finally,  i can't wait anymore boy... But, wait, only ps 5 ? How about ps 4?
Thor - are you a calm and reasonable person   Kratos - go ask the Greek ones in heaven
de la rifaron men no mames :'0
Well after gow4 kratos is all warmed up and ready to fight real battle.
BEST GAME EVER
Нечего не поменяли, все как было так и осталось.
Нечего не поменяли, все как было так и осталось.
Very much excited for this!!!!
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: my rage is not full so yes for a moment
động mạch, có gái kìa anh Dũng, hú hú
I don't have any console 😔😔😔😔😔😔 Still excited for it
ok ok ok did I see Boy riding a spirit ram?
Can't wait for it
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos: why don’t you ask my BOI after he told me to stop thinking like a father and to think more like a general
Ok Sony time to buy a PS5
Looks Great! 😔😔❤️❤️
Tyr looks like a chad; no wonder the Jotnar took kindly to him.
😪😪
Really hope the one-cut camera made it to this game as well!
lol at Thor asking someone if they're a calm and reasonable person.
Did they get Josh Brolin to voice Thor?
Hypeeeee!
Looks pretty solid
Wow wow wow😎
Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, Boy, you all know how this one word sounds and means many different things.
Oh boi this is dope 🔥
OH MY GOD...I'm actually tearing up
Copy paste
Já tem um comentário aqui do qual eu já me identifico, mas gostaria de frisar ainda mais que...  EU TE AMO, KRATOS.
FINALLY!!
Is it gonna be on ps4
Not gagging. Was expecting more. Looks like a PS4 game.
In moments of crisis panic does nothing ,harness it , let it serve you.
I cant wait!
I think we will get our Answer
Esperava mais
The only thing I will say is please dont give us the same troll in 5 different colors...
I swear...I watched this whole trailer with a huge smile, ear to ear.
Wait, Who is Tyr 😂
It can get better then this take you time sony
У меня слов нет..., это просто... Ахуено..
Noooonooooo
Why is a black girl in this game ?
Gods of War
Ставьте класс. Если ваш батя такой же 👍👍👍😪
this is my 5th time watching this and I'm still so mesmerized y'all
I cannot put into words how happy and excited I am. Been waiting for this for so long
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is the girl at the end teasing another mythology we might see?
The only reason I am buying ps5
:0 carajo
Everyone notice the Loki hint at the beginning with the horns? 😅
Is this a dlc?
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Okay, which one do you want? Helios, Hermes, Poseidon or my daddy?
Boring like before
I don't know why. But i am literally crying for a game.
I can see people giving more attention to Spider-Man 2 than a sequel of a game who won the the game of the year award. 😑    I am not hating Spider-Man 2, I am also excited for it but seriously...
Yeeeeesss!!!
WAW
If you are not hyped, get outta here!
Its finally happening
Is this available on PS4 ?
I can't wait to see kratos axe vs Thor Hamer
It looks like the DLC for the last part, even the attack patterns are the same
Triple H…..
Goty again?
Im sorry but this game finna be trash
Will it be on PS4?
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father & start thinking like a General.                                           Kratos: NO!!!!!                                                                              *I felt that*
Avengers has left the chat
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeee
... it's the same thing
Man Kratos and atreus is exactly like hades and zagreus
Top Tyr lads!
goosebumps bro.....goosebumps
atreyus got new powers
YESSSSSSSSS
Ahhhhhh, so refreshing just seeing the promo I know this is gonna be game of the year
Ma boi got his puberty , I’m buying ps5 rn 🤡
our boy has grown up i see
WOW
Its time for Norse Mythology to end
Wonder if the player can equip that fur cloak(the one kratos wear at the start of this) willingly.
Thor : are you a calm and reasonable person   All the Greek gods : Nooo..
💪
"... And act like a General."  I got a SHIVER. That probably hits a very sore spot for Kratos, since he was shoved into the spot against his will pretty much, lost his original army against the barbarians, and then gets blinded by his status which leads to him killing his OG family.  Atreus, boy, you have no idea what you just said.
the girl in the end is either angraboda or sigyn.
Boi with that Loki-like silhouette at the beginning
1:09  skoll and hoty
Why didn't they make any live action movie man 😭
Any positive Id on the girl at the end?
IT'S NOT A PHASE DAD
Most be best game on the world, of all time
Guys, is he a calm and reasonable person?
Incredible
Why does Tyr look like Zeus 😐
Nowadays game is like watching movie .I preferred Gow 3 better.
I would like to point out that Kratos is around 8 feet tall and Tyr towers over him
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!  Kratos: *N O*  Atreus: 🤐  Meanwhile, in a parallel universe...  Loki: Father-   Odin: *Hauuurrghhhgh!*  Loki: 🤐
Kratos would soon become grandpa
Where is Thor though ? 😂
GoW pixar version
Can’t wait This  finna be littt🔥🔥
Those  Thor vs Kratos.coming true?
was that the mother in the end?
We've gotten to the point where we can put straight up gameplay into the trailer and it will blend in perfectly
Valkyrie at the end?
Ohhhhh yeaaaaaah esketit😤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want a cutscene between Kratos and Thor where they both call back their respective hammers  Update : I CALLED IT!
Ladies and gentlemen here comes the game of the year .😬🙈
THIS IS HYPE!!!!!!
DLC 😒
Oh yeasssssz time to kill the gods again I can't frakking wait
They just couldn't resist blackwashing more mythology.
This gameplay is looking awesome, hope their will be some new powers too😍😍
Nothing much changed from the last game and this one.
Gnar gnar
the shield is changed in a few scenes, either those are tied to abilities which means upgrades or we have new shields we can buy
Girl :- Sorry you’re shorter than 6’11 I cant date you   The guy compared to her :- 2:50
I can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥it's gonna be lit Kratos
This game looks amazing.
Uff lo que se viene amigooooooo!!!!!!
This is going to be amazing. I usually never get hyped about video games but I seriously can't wait to play this. It's going to be a masterpiece  Also, if you haven't watched Raising Kratos, you should definitely check it out. It's free on YouTube
(Looks for BOI comments)
Will it be on ps4????
Okay but was that Loki's wife, Agrboda?!
Am I the only one noticing the flipped script when atreus walks into the cave?
IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS, PANIC DOES NOTHING...
Now i need a PS5.
WOW WOW WOW!!!!
They found Tyr, I hope I can find a ps5 in store now....
Why have a brown woman in nordic lands?
Esta facha XD
Boooye!
Waiting For Monthsss To Play My FAVOURITE GAME of All time man 🥺😍
People who disliked this video are xbox community 😂😂😂
1:35 Sindri acting like an anime girl.
¡¡Ay caramba!!
This is awesome..
I wonder if they're gonna tie in Tyrs adventure in Egypt since they ended on the black girl at the end. I always thought they should have dealt with Egyptian mythology before Norse.
The hype is real with this one can’t wait
FINALLLY!!!!!!!
"Stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general" - teen atreus
Gente no que esse jogo(franquia) se tornou, adorei kkk
Thats how you do a reveal, rockstar...
Take my money NOWW
Oh, yes Daddy!
Can’t wait to see tik tok use the concept art for this game as actual mythology.
Please do not take it netflix wOkE way
Бой некст доор а не и паст доор
Start thinking like a general. Boy you lucky you ain't born yet in GOW 3
3:06 BOOBA
"R U a calm and reasonable person?"     Flashback of jars cracking near a bed
Normadic northern hemisphere & black skin...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thor from the comics solos Kratos.
👍🎅
Soo...gamepass?
WHEN
It will be exclusive to the ps5 or also to the ps4
3:04 - LOOOOOL!
Xbox game
It’s sad it’s no a
PS4 graphics rock…
Is there any date announced?
Bring it to PC please. I don't own a PS5.
Este jogo está muito lindo, doido pra jogar o game
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general                                                      Kratos: No!!!                                                                                                                                                                               Everyone: 😳
0:22 I see boi finally learned how to hunt a deer.
Love how the last part started with kratos teaching atreus, how to hunt dear in which he sucked and in this trailer we see atreus bringing one🦌 all by himself. That's some great & subtle character development showcase.. 💯🔥 No doubts it's gonna be lit 🔥
Ну как же без негров в скандинавских эпосах - это же несчитово!
Pra me Kratos morre
Thor sufrirá ante el gran Spartano Kratos
😍😍😍
Joder que guapo
Don't get me wrong, but is the dog sleigh the only new thing gameplay wise in this game?
Xbox: “This year will be our yea...” PS: “Boi...”
Gonna be an instant classic
Everyone: “Release date?” Santa Monica: “You’ll get your answers soon enough. Well, some of them…”
and they ended it with a black girl, congrats and get out
I like how this shows that Kratos doesn't want to think like his old self because of where it led him and wants to avoid such things at all costs.
Oh no who’s that black girl at the end?
Sandra el PS 4 ?
I miss the old GOW…this just isn’t it for me. The atmosphere and all the constant bright colors and the previous games lackluster boss fights. That’s what made the old GOWs so iconic. Hoping they picked up their game…pun intendex
meu game preferido AAAAAA❤
what does a black woman do in Scandinavia???
Since atreus is teenager now, looks like he's not gonna climb on our back anymore
ME ENOJA UN POCO Q SOLO SEA PARA PS5
Playstation  se sacó la verga
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person”  Me:about that..
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person ?"  Kratos: "Why don’t we ask my Blades of Chaos."
😍😍😍😍😍
IAM waiting for the release
WHATT
I might be wrong but is the little girl at the end Angrboda ? Like Loki’s Wife ? Or just a random character ?
I'm aware how unlikely it is, but a Hades reference tucked away somewhere would be neat.
Yes.
Dang! they're going now into next generation TIME FLIES!
🔨 vs 🪓
Thor sounds a whole lot like Neegan in this trailer
2:00 Is that Josh Brolin voice? Who is he voicing?
Yo I'm hyped!!!!
Is it coming to ps4 also. Cause it said PlayStation consoles
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEE VIENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Thor: "are you calm and reasonable person ?"   Kratos : "boiiiiiiiiiii"
"ODIN! The Ghost of Sparta has returned! I bring the destruction of Asgard!"
LOS JUEGOS DE PLAYSTATION SON COMO SI FUERA QUE UN CHICO DE 12 AÑOS TIENE UNA SUPER PC Y EL MISMO CREA LOS JUEGOS .CORTO Y PEGO Y CORTO Y PEGO...Y EN DOS DIAS TERMINO EL JUEGO....ESA SENSACION TIENEN TODOS LOS JUEGOS DESDE PS4 QUE SON ASI ...
أخيييييييييييييييييييييييرا وهو ياس
This is all a setup for a final showdown between father and son.
CAN'T WAIT for the game
Wait, how did Freya break the curse?
I hope it comes out for ps4 to
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  *Me, remembering all the past GOW games  "Kinda"
just dont take Mimir out of the game please
❤️😭❤️❤️❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️❤️😘❤️😘❤️😘❤️❤️😘❤️😘😘 I 😘❤️ thanks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks the same…. There is no next gen here… but anyway I’m gonna play it…
What's new?
Kratos Ragnarok V De Dios no tiene nada!
DLC - 80$ LOL
Another game that beast boy shub will play after comeback
My cinnamon roll Atreus is all grown up now…I’M SO PROUD OF HIM!!! *weeps tears of happiness*
Hopefully i’ll have my hands on a ps5 before this comes out😭
@vegetta777
Just don't make all the troll death animations the exact same and I'll be happy.
Gow Ragnarok : Are you calm and reasonable person? Gow3 : ...Press O repeatedly
Son de esas cosas que vale la pena seguir viviendo en esta epoca
We love Thor’s sarcasm
“You seem like a clam and reasonable person, are you a calm and reasonable person? “   Looking back at the Greek Pantheon  Kratos was was many things but never calm and reasonable.
Looks incredible 🔥🔥
FINALY TRAILER!!! IM WANNA CRY😭😭😭
Deers are heavy AF. Atreus is very strong
Mokka commendry
0:42 -- Kind of curious on if those two dogs are suppose to represent Skoll and Hati possibly being in the game.
finally its here cant wait to get this in hand
Woooo The Hype!!
The "BOY" still hasn't grown up?
Loki's wife is at the end!
So apparently tyr is the one who was with atreus in the stone tapestry, not Kratos.
Boooooooooooooooooy
Man tyr's tall
Tyr has 2 hands still, so i guess Boy/Loki is still gonna be Fenrir’s progenitor eventually.   Unsure what direction they’re going with it, since Jormungandr exists already but Boy/Loki hasn’t had a chance to pump out any babies.  Both Jorm and Fenrir play a huge part in the Ragnarok prophecy so i can’t see them leaving him out. But had Odin and Tyr bound him with the cord already, Tyr would be down a hand.
Mimir just casually flipping pages with a stick is something I did not know I needed to see
*LET'S GOOOOOO*
With the Xbox Game Pass thundering the last couple of months, GoW Ragnarok, Spiderman 2, and Wolverine will decide whether Playstation can win the new gen era. Excited about these.
نايس العبة حلوة
I love the music
Tired of the kid already
Shut up Loki. I just wanna know the answer about how Kratos step into Norse Land
now should have ps5 😍😍😍
Atreus going to be a teen rebel here lol
*Fangirl screams*
lol
How much you wanna bet that the girl is sigyn
Norse mythology is known for their black representation
Was anyone else surprised on how big Tyr is…. Cause he mad Kratos look small asf….
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person”  Greek pantheon: “Am I a joke to you?”
BOYYYYYY‼️
Super super duper EXCITED!!!!!
Oh I do hope Athena enters the equation.
Excuse me , Will it have on ps4 ?
Thor: are you calm and reasonable?  Kratos: I am now but these kids spectating dont know what maturity is.
It's nice to see Lilo Pelekai all grown up...
HEY SONNY WE WANT REALISTIC HUMANITY GRAPHICS NOT CARTOON THIS IS NOT NEXT GEN
Wait, is that Hades right there? 2:12
can wee playing on the ps4??
Kratos lost powers again in the newgame ? Santa monica : Yes like an old game 🥲
HYYYYYPPPPPE
man atreus 10 out of 10
This is ps4
The game which sells Playstation! I can't even begin to describe how hyped I am.
There is not much difference than the part befor same places same gameplay same fights
man best game of the year
Hype Lets hope we dont fight a reskined boss 4 times again
Only.... Ps4...ps5....best game ever 2022....
Literally the best part of the show.  No date or timeframe, but I don't even care.  I want them to take their time.
KRATOS!
😉 I'm 🔥 Waiting 🔥 Game Play 💯
This Game gonna be GOTY I can tell
The girl at the end may be Andrboda or Loki’s future wife
Its sad that those who are having only ps4's cannot play the new games. I have only PS4. 😢😢
Ohhhhh boy  Boy play it
This should not be a PS4 game and you can tell. The graphics definitely took a big hit just look at Spider-Man 2 reveal which is captured on PS5
Visiblemente orgasmeado*
You must prepare yourself 😤😤😤
2 Gods of War in attendance to the ULTIMATE WAR OF THE GODS  im so hyped for this game
Dios mío me meo
who is the child at the end?
Tip real stick rn
I hope he takes the Blade of Olympus 🗿
Is that Josh Brolin voicing Thor?
Tyr looks freaking awesome, hope we get to see him in some fight scenes.
Dad Simulator 2! Let's Go!
I thought kratos was old
ES NORMAL QUE UN TRAILER ME EXITE TANTO?
Can not even express my excitement for this...  just wow
Вот и негры-скандинавские боги/йотуны подьехали. Сони всё-таки продавила.
Boy!
joga aí galera do Xbox 🥱 zzzz
No entiendo ni una mierda jaja
So this takes a few years after the last one. Ohhhhh man we are going to be in for some big surprises.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: L3 + R3
I was expecting Atreus to look more older.
Tyre is alive wow 😳😳😳😳
3:05: Big oof 😬
This trailer's already having me giddy!!!
Kratos: world’s best viking
being a father and having a family, makes kratos appreciate life more . . . what a amazing character development . . .
THOR: ARE YOU A CALM AND A REASONABLE PERSON?  KRATOS: ASK YOUR KIDS
Beautiful
🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
Lindo demais
Only for PS5??
What you just saw is the reveal trailer of game of the year in 2022.            Vetus Ordo Seclorum.  Hail old gods!
I know Kratos doesn't want a repeat of Olympus but it will end in death and destruction. Either Odin or Atreus will force him back into that mindset
Hope it comes in 2022 :(
Welp. Looks like I got my ps5 just in time
THE GAME IS AMAZING, BUT I STILL HOPE MORE GORE COMBAT ... MORE BLOOD !!!
The gameplay looks incredibly cinematic.. Moreso than any other game I have seen. The animations are nearly seamless.
Ohhhh I am pumped!
stop thinking like a father , try think like a general  everyone who knows what happen in  old GOW series : im sure u dont want to see that
😍😍😍😍
The dad of war is back 💪
"WAR IS NOT THE ONLY WAY" The Legends Tyr and Kratos🔥
are you calm and reasonable person? kratos: *rips head of a dragon* yis
And there we go with the black girl at the end for virtue signalling....even here
Time to death, Thor.
Kratos looks like a normal person in front of Tyr and Kratos is a 7 foot dude…
TRAILERAZO!!!!
Preisteixom
I can't wait to play this on a system I can't get my hands on.......
Cool.
Thor are u a calm person Kratos  press L3 + R3
Coming to GOTY 2022 near you.
PS4 ???
What if 'Can we stop Ragnarok' IS the ragnarok?
Y para el play 4? Nada humildes
Do Nada uma criançinha 🤔 hahahahahahahahaha
2:53 i want to kill tyr
He is coming
ARRGGGHHHHHH!!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!
Кончил!
Osea no estará para ps4 ?
Kratos: "Which way do we go?" Atreus: "In the direction of Tyr"
let the language come 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
I think i came
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nhóc boy nhìn lớn r nhỉ
Is no one else obsessing over the fact that Tyr still has both hands
awsome❤❤❤
Odin confirmed!!! 2:13. That creature came from the Bifrost light.
FINALLY I FINISHED THE GAME 6 TIMES
imgine blade of olympus will stop ragnarok just like it stopped the titans
The Legend!!.....
Dang, this is gonna be Epic
Did anyone saw a cent tower in the trailer? It's time to get back to greece during time travel.
Everyone: Can we get the game this year pls pls   Sony : 1:57. "NO"
ps5 only?
Dear santa monica it would be great if you would add an option to fight bosses anytime you like.  pls support my cmt if you guys also want this option.
* Another comment about Kratos being a calm and reasonable person *
Thor: Are you cal-  Kratos: *UNITED STATES OF SMASH!!!!!!*
Sons of anarchy opie As Thor..
I am so glad that I’m still alive to see this !!!!
"Kratos...Can you become a responsible Person" ?   Kratos : Yeah L3 + R3
Looks dumb. We didn't ask for this!! Jk I love it lol
Boy talks too much, when I get the game I'm not upgrading any of his gear, no Christmas for him
Why can Freya attack??? I remember she said she can fight nor defend herself
Justo en la pobreza y escases 💔
Where is that big white bird.. Their were so many theory about it related to zeus..
The black girl at the end took me out of it but otherwise I’m super hype
🔥🔥ITS FINALLY HERE🔥🔥 I AM READY Father
RIP XBOX
Lets go!! I freaking can’t wait!!
very nice
Boi you've grown!
2:35 , what is Atreus fighting up oN?
Unbelievable!!!!
Thor: Are you calm and reasonable person? *Greek gods left the entire chat*
Just made my day watching this trailer 🔥
I just hope ps4 can hold this up
Fnjgkfkfkdnfnfjjf i love it
Everyone talking about Kratos being a calm and reasonable person but nobody talking about how Freya attacked them Is Freya's curse broken?
Cool, but when am I going to be able to buy a PS5?
SOO EXCITED :D
1:46 they brought back the grapple attack 😍😍😍
yo look at the details on the hammer designs th0 2:10
Atreus & that girl gonna get up to something, I know it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
TYR??????? 😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is this another black live matter campaign again??
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person Kratos:Ask your sons
thor : are you a calm and reasonnable person ?  everyone in the comments : *insert an are you a calm and reasonnable person joke*
I was really hoping this game would be released this December. Seemed most fitting considering the game takes place up North.
Shut up and TAKE MY MONEEEH!!!
Last chick is loki $10 bet
I hope Atreus doesn’t become an annoying whiny teen in the game.
Tyr is bigger that kratos
Why do i think the way BOI appears is a foreshadowing?
from the trailer it looks clear that we are going to fight Thor, Loki and Odin. Does this also mean that we also get to fight Hela? It will be super cool to fight the goddess of death.
Thor: “You seem like a calm and reasonable person.” Kratos: 👀
Will this come in ps4 also?
Where is thor...🤔
Please sony make this the last gow let this masterpiece end
They gave away too much
Lvl 1 weapons. Did Kratos focus all his power to Mjolnir? Did he fell into a river? Get it?
It kil me so hard!!!!
Thor:"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" *Press R3 for Rage Mode* Kratos:"Define 'calm and reasonable' for me."
Game: The Game
باين فيها تنوع
It’s so beautiful
Prediction: kratos will probably stop ragnarok or at least try. But will ultimately be kill by thor or Odin by the end of the game. Letting atreus get revenge on Odin and the other asgardians, and fulfilling his destiny to becoming loki in the next game.
Th voice of the boy sounds annoying
kinda hope kratos yell "bring me thanos!"
😪😪😪
Finally
It’s time.
Wowowo
Hope they release this on ps4 as well 🙄
thor: ARE YOU A CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON!? Kratos: insert conceited face meme...
Уииииии❤️
The greatest reason to purchase a ps5 in 2021 🪓
Excuse me? Is this really gonna be for ps4 or its just a rumor?
Ps4?
Shut up and take my money !
:0
neaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Tyr is still live!! Wow!!!
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: yes *Kratos said calmly*
I'm gonna pre-order before I can even pre-order
Q tooooop🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kratos: breathes  *HEAVILY INTENSE SPARTAN MUSIC*
TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH
único motivo que eu compraria o PS5 até agora
It looks more like an explanation to the original than a next gen sequel :/
I just wish Kratos can jump in combat
Two surprises from PlayStation, I was waiting for the reveal trailer for this game and Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
Was that josh Brolin I heard?
Is GOW ragnarok a ps5 exclusive?
Why freya pull up on them like that 😂 0:42
Eu esperava mais dos gráficos.
*WE*
im not racist, not at all but what place had black people in nordic mitology?
Is it coming for ps4 or not??
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
GOTY
Tyr is most likely the one asking kratos if he is a calm and reasonable person, not thor.
thor is there
Cant wait to kill all of these mystic creatures
If we can go to Asgard like we couldn't do in the last game this game is hype
Why are the graphics so bad, looks the same as ps4
como la extraño
Kratos is gonna kill Thor and smash him to pieces.
Ragnarok is coming.
I'm super excited for this game but I can't believe the same people who hype this up dissed Marvel's Avengers when it has the same combat designer and it shows.
Man Halo, Zelda and this!! what a year 2022 will be
Almost forgot to watch it today
The voice of Thor is Beta😎👍
Freya using her sword FREYA IS FINALLY USING HER SWORD
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  *sees ⭕️ on top of Thor*
Can you wait for this game Me: 1:57
I have a feeling Atreus will become evil...
as an xbox fan I can honestly say I am going to get a ps5 hopefully this holiday season. I used to own a ps2 for most of my childhood and I miss those ps classics!!!
I feel like they should make his son growing up now
greek mythology vs norse mythology
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? I guess Thor hasn't played GOW before.
KRAATOS
Cant wait to beat thor to the dirt.
Girl: “You’ll get your answers soon enough.” Me: “When will I be able to get a PS5?!” Girl: “Well… some of them.”
Why it sounds like Deku???
My money please take it .
Nanananananananananana amigo epico
Mano akele cara ta vivo q mata no final do game ou  tô maluco
I hope other GoW games explores other mythologies too
Either Thor’s sarcasm is godly or he’s up for an extremely rude awakening…
Opppppppppp
I'm so hype for this game, but I can't get my hands on a PS5 :(
I can tell this game is really going to make you feel like you’re raising a disobedient teenager.
Many deaths incoming !! GIVEMEGODOFWAR !!!!
Graphics Same As 2018 No Difference Only Some New Features Added
You can tell these are all early parts of the game from the look of the weapons and armor, I wonder what new weapon they will add 🤔
The Lord of the PS4 is back and better than ever
Cuando sale el juego 👍
0:58 freya breaked kratos' guardian sheild😱😱😱
🔥🔥 KRATOS RETURN 🔥🔥
Oppp 🔥🔥 😁😁
Sounded like Thor was voiced by David Harbor for a moment, what a dream that would have been, but Ryan Hurst is going to be absolutely golden in this role, I can already tell.
🤯
Kratos looks like he's 45 or 50 with that gut
I will buy PS5 for this game
I HAVE A FULL ON ERECTION
Dioosss, eventazooooo
Kratos 🔥🔥
Насилия не хватает...крови и расчлененки
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general!"  Kratos' brain: Rage of Sparta theme intensifies*
Thor sounds like Josh Brolin to me.
Hyped but I would have liked some real gameplay demo.
man kratos has a great voice huh
Take my money noooow!!!
I feel kratos pain of being the tallest one until he stands face to chest with tyr
Thor: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "Is that like a personal attack or something?"
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable  person ?   Thor's mind: "Please be a calm and reasonable person "
FINALLYYYYYY
*I came here to hear Kratos say BOI and was left disappointed.*
The Rebellious Stage Of the Teen Will be Kratos's Greatest Challenge Yet!
What is that Scandinavian music? So beautiful ! Did anyone get a link?
Cool but I don't think it's worth a thousand dollars
Estará para ps4?
"FATHER, IT WAS NEVER A PHASE!"
I expected kratos to be older .. and atreus to be in his 20's
ps5 only?
looks like DLC with no major improvements
Va a salir para la ps4 ?? 🥺🥺😭
ALAAAAAMADREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
HYYYYYPEEEEEE! So Epic dude, cannot wait :)
شازی یاری مێژوو، بژی کرەیتۆز..
Oh no, not teenagers.
😳
por fin el rompeculos de los xboxers jajaja
It’s interesting to see Freya acting like Kratos from the original trilogy. Filled with rage and fueled by revenge.
Tyr traveled a lot of places and I know for a fact he knows who Kratos is….so why is he sizing up to him like he about to something?
I was hoping for a new character design for Atreus, he looks the same but longer
Can't wait to see thor get punched 😂
If keeping it likely will there be N actual Movie
this will be very frantic
No release date 😂, i know the date coming 2023 November then delayed again😂
2016 do not be sorry be better 2021 are you a calm and reasonable person ?
No release date?
MEU DEUS !!!!
Это очень круто, наконец показали как выглядит Тюр, графика моё почтение. Жду шедевр и я перехожу на Xbox
Beter textures juhuhuhu I must buy ps5 for this game!!!!
Did anybody else notice odin's spies? Huginn and Muninn
BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY
You just had to add a black character in the game smh
is it just me or is Thor voiced by THANOS???
Is Thor going to be the final boss or the penultimate boss?
I'm on Xbox but this looks absolutely incredible.
Thor : Are you a calm and reasonable person ? Kratos : depends ... are you as stupid as hercules ?
OMFG!!!
OK, isso já ultrapassou o que chamamos de épico há muito tempo...
Luar biasa
Mermão imagina o tyr e Kratos metendo a porrada no Odin ou Thor juntos hahahah os dois deuses da guerra lutando juntos isso seria incrível.
This is Loki multiverse 😂😂😂
yessssssss yessssssss yessssssssss
My boi bout to hit that puberty 😭 I'm so proud of it
ponete pantalones sony por favor
WE
A brief analysis of what they showed. At about 0:35 you can see the tattoos on Atreus' arm and the ball he is holding. After translating tattoos from the Icelandic language, we get such words. The inscription on the ball "Hati", the wolf from mythology that chases the moon, in my opinion is a collar tag for one of the dogs from the harness and I can be sure that the other tag has the word "Skoll", which is the name of the wolf that chases the sun. Ok now tattoos, on his neck he has written "Peaceful heart" or "Peaceful mind", "Fast dog" on his wrist and "Arm strength" on his arm .... So typical tattoos in those times xd
Fact - I don't think they are gonna fight against thor or odin
I lost my patience of waiting for this game after watching this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well, time to get a PS5 I guess🤷🏼‍♂️
Vera mari kartos
Take my money !!!!!!!!!!!!
A lot of people are hyped about Atreus/Loki. I hope for a scene of the two Gods of War fighting together. Mimir described Tyr as being peaceful. He looks like he's ready to burned down Asgard in that scene with Kratos.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thor : "you seem like a calm and reasonable person"  while showing Kratos screaming and slamming his blade to enemies
Xbox can have elder scrolls 6
Wow, that kid's voice is incredibly authentic and doesn't take me out of the world at all!!
1:45 kratos : get over here!!!!
3:06 I like the expression
2:50 kratos looks like a little boi
I bet in game when Thor drops that line the context comes off as a sarcastic insult because he knows Kratos's past.
Esta bien alto el atreus
token for the clifhanger
Could you imagine if they got Chris hemsworth to voice Thor?
Let's hope Boi Dadson is actually useful this time around
Am I the only one who feels like this looks like PS4 graphics.
I can’t wait to see how the final boss fight will be
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos beats Thor calmly
so, this is alternate universe that loki want for "glorious purpose" ?
This game can be play in PS4 right or only PS5?
I'll buy PS5 just for this.
2:29 Dark Elves ????????
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  The greek gods: Yeah, about that...
Yep. Worth the wait.
Atreus: Stop thinking like a dad and start thinking like a general. Kratos: No!!! Me: Oh f@#$ yeah
LETS GOOO
Atreus's transition to Loki is strong in this one. Brace yourselves for a tragic end boys!
2:22 thats Chaos Beast from Egypt?
When i saw atreus i thinked that he is of like 30 y/o
wow 😍🔥
I'm just excited to have some more Father/Son bond development with Mimir as the witty Uncle and Brok and Sindri as the quirky cousins
game of da year is coming
So Vidar gonna be in this game or what?
So disappointed in this it straight up looks like the DLC we should have gotten or part of it..
I wonder how many times he says “ BOOOOOY
Ye
Will it be on PS4?
I have no idea why, but Thor definitely sounds mentally unstable. Psychotic for sure
Sony please give me a world serpent collector’s edition
I’m gonna play all the GOWs, in what order do you recommend to play?
Where is sutur ????
"You'll get your answers soon enough... Well, some of them." And by that she means in the next trailer... maybe.
I have one double this game playing only ps5 or both ps4 and ps5
SIII el gordos war vuelve
❤️🔥❤️❤️
RUMO AO GOTY 2022 👍😁👑👏👏👏
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOY GREW UP
Black people in Scandinavian mythology??
To be fair, compared to some of the stuff Thor did Kratos is more calm and reasonable.
Playing Chains of Olympus on Now, but this looks a bit better.
“You’ll get your PS5 soon enough, well some of you” is what the girl in the end of the trailer should have said.
They wouldn't like Thor to be played by Chris Hemsworth himself
Please more crazy combos
I love how Kratos is so done with this and act like Ragnarok is just another Tuesday for him.
BR?
I bet that girl at the end is Freya
Опять чернокожие викинги,  в США окончательно *банулись
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *Gets GOW 3 flashbacks*  Yeah about that….
Did anyone else think of Hercules when Tyr stood up the way he did?
Kratos knows how it will end, after all he´s the king of the olympus.
Look's more like a DLC from the 2018 then a actual new gen game 😐
Please let there be more bosses and a variety of mini bosses.
wow:) so very excited 🥴🥴☺️☺️☺️
Is it just me or does it look like the 2018 gow graphic wise? Don’t get me wrong It looks beautiful either way, I’m stoked to play this on ps4 since I don’t have ps5, it looked and played amazing on ps4
LEEETSS GOOOOOOOO!!!
oh no they will squeeze a series out of that kid.
I wanted more pantheons included this time, Greek norse Egyptian asian japanese heck something for aethist even
One game and XBOTs are out of the race...
Yo finally.... Soo hyped for this!!!
I need this on ps4 tooo please sony please...!!!
Woooow
I wish they hadn’t revealed tyr..
is it only on PS5?
2022 is going to be very expensive year for ps players ..
Who don't have consoles 😟
Yeah, after how meh the 2018 one was, you couldn't pay me to get hyped for this.  Sorry, but bring back the fast-paced action and light platforming of old. Kratos used to stand tall amongst the likes of Dante, and Ryu Hayabusa. Now he's just someone's depressed dad.  What happend, man. You used to be cool.
This Is the best thing i see this morning its make my day❤️🔥🔥
Nothing change in this game this is next part of last game
what's the release date?  3:00
yes yes YES
OMFG A NEW PLAYSTATION MOVIE 😱 !?!?!
Thor: *"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"* Kratos: "So anyway, I started raging."
Kratos got the john snow drip on
I love that they didn't completely reinvent everything. The weapons, the characters, the viewpoints, the environment. There was no closure from the previous game, it was so open ended. Keeping that continuity will make it feel like a seamless resumption of where GOW left off.
Just Wow!. Wow!..
i need the preorder date now
PQP ❤❤😍
kinda curious how they gonna handle tyr and fenrir situation..
We wu_s Viking gods n shiiet
Boy
@Rafa é do Brasil
Nada de especial eu espera mais tipo muitoooooooooo muitooooooo muitoooooo mais
I gotta stay alive until this comes out.
Can’t wait
What is your evaluation of the game out of 100. 100 / Can you tell me, thank you❤️❤️
Job interview  Interviewer: Would you say you’re a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *lies Sure.
Always like Tyr from his stories in the Game.
Did his axe get smaller?
2:12 Do you guys realize that could very well be Heimdall?
Ya heard of it now Cory????  Cory: “Still don’t know what this is” 😂
“You’ll get your answers soon enough... we’ll some of them”    **ends with saying release date** 😕😐😕😐😕
Please someone tell me it will be on ps4 too
anh em Cter đâu rồiiiiiiiiii
😍😍😍😍😍😍 THIS IS GOING TO BE PERFECT!
Looks like a dlc
Caaaaaaraaaaaaaaaaaalhooooooooooooo
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!" City of Athens and Rhodes: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
Winter is coming
Brooooooo,  fukn pumped badly 💪💪🙏🙏
BOI! what happened to your face?
2:34 dang atreus got riding skill
I hope there will be real bosses, not just trolls in different color
My boy is growing up 🥺
Our boy becomes a man.
I remember back in 2019 I actually got to meet one of the audio workers on the last GoW. I obviously had to ask her if there was going to be a part 2 and all she said is that she “legally has to say no” I fanboyed so hard
Thor: You seem like a calm person Kratos: yeah I AM "Pull the axe throw it and use blade of chaos" Kratos: i am calm
Answers rarely are as exciting as the questions or usually just lead to more questions
My only question is if sunny suljic is still Atreus
Epic
I'm so excited for this.
GOTY yo
Still waiting for the elder scrolls VI
"mix of gameplay and in-game cinematics"   so it's gameplay
I just nutted
2:25 Looks a little bit of Greece found its way on Midgard. Thats an f-ing centaur.
Boiiii is back
дизлайк вам за то что вы такие жадные стали!вынудили меня перейти на  xbox!
The graphics barely upgraded, looks like a $45 dlc imo😐
necesito la fecha de estreno
I’m very excited for this game! Loved the previous one
Moje.
gow 5 ragnorok its awesome cant wait please reveal ps4 or ps5 only we want ps4 also
I will get my answers soon enough
Osm😍😍😍😍
Wow… it be nice to have a ps5
Freya ruin makeup really heartbreaking to see..she must have been crying and grieving all day and night..she's in the bad place..poor Freya.
Daqui a pouco um ano de lançado e com os mesmos jogos de ps4, kkkk
“The time grows near”
Tyr has both hands sooooo…
Atreus carrying deer = forshadowing he will be a deer
Only ps5 or ps4
Capture on ps5 but definitely can run with 60fps 1080p on ps4 pro. Not much next gen thing here as it will release on both platform
no mamessssssss ahuevoooooooooooooooo
This is the only game that can make me drop $1k on a console.
I literally can't stop seeing this
Thought it was GoW 4 DLC for a moment
holy sheeest! 2 gods of war raise hands against all asgard 0_o need to buy ps5 only for this..
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: where’re your sons?
Vera level(It, s awesome) 🔥🔥🔥
Quero ver até onde Kratos vai... 👊🏽
Who blew the horn
believe me cant wait to use Thor hammer to kill THOR
Awsooooooome
wwwooowwwwwwww.cant wait thankyou sony
LET US HAVE THE GAME SOON!! AND ON PS4!! YOU CANT FIND A PS5 TO SAVE YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW!!!
That music slaps!  I'm so hype!
Mimir glad to see you!
I can’t waittttt this is so hype
Anyone else wanting to see Jack play this game
Why this game is only for PS5, we all know the hardware is not enough for everyone
Now kratos gonna say teenage not boy anymore
The only reason why I want to buy PS5
That winter never end
ps4 and ps5?
Freya is coming for cheeks
I hope Atreus takes his father’s place as the new protagonist, but better than how Kratos was.
Kratos will have this intense rage that he won't be able to control any longer and he'll ask Atreus to end him so he won't cause any other destruction.
The dad of us 2😂
2:24 is tha any kind of centaur? 2:27 and where are they? Svartalfheim?
Cannot wait for this game to come out
Tier
Bear McCreary is back on the music. Already a classic game.
Hyped for this Mastepiece as an Xbox player🤩😍
Hints of Celtic mysticism to this
Neh, they should've made this a full PS5 exclusive in order to fully exploit the true potential of this game. If it runs on a PS4, then the developers are just pushing back.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  That's the pot calling the kettle black there, Thor
Жаль что не в этом году.
Finally
wheres the 4K60 lol
Is it just me or does try look like Zeus
Whilst this is clearly still a PS4 game at its core, can we all just appreciate how amazing this looks? Just the thought that even with cutbacks this is going to run on a 2013 console is just a testament to how far games have come.   This is going to be a great experience for all, and even more so for PS5 players. Hope everyone can get one by the time this launches.
❄❄💙❄❄💪😱
2:54 reminds me of Kratos vs Hercules
The boy sounds like Tom Holland asking around
Espero un KILZONE 😢
THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS INSANE AND CONSISTENT.
“You’ll get your answers soon enough”  But not the release date.
OMFG!!!
The best Sony fabulosos  Deus da guerra, vcs são top no world Sony the best games.🙂🏆
Is that girl Calliope?
KRATOOOOOOOOOOOOS
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Play GOW 3 and come back later
That black and white wolves pulling the sleigh is Sköll and Hati, Loki's grandchildren.
1:54 Am I the only one that got chills on that scene?
i hate Atreaus voice actor, he sounds so american 💀
is that valkarie in the last scene? just guesting
Tyr looks like Ras Putin
🔥🔥🔥
Mimir reading book using spoon with his mouth....almost got me.....
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: Well yes, nobody argues with me in Olympus.
Who's voicing Thor???
I cried.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: Not since the boy hit puberty.
Yess yes yesssss yeeeeeessss
Well I'll be damned Tyr is alive
Missed that voice...🤞
Perfect 🤩
Tbh, this looks like a DLC than a new game. Hope this game is as beast as previous game
Surprise Kratos didn’t say boy
Kratos: Boy, control yourself Teenage Atreus: Pfff, yea like whatever…..
LETS GOOO I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TRAILER
Olha pra um Ragnarok tá bem calmo esse trailer kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
I love xbox
I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Когда выйдет?
Loki is probably manipulating Kratos to kill all the Norse gods to bring about Ragnarok and Loki will be the final boss.
There's only so much hype one man can take.
oh boy what a hype.....
Lo mejor del día,Te amo Kratos.
that Norse black kid tho
Captured on ps5 ingameplay and cinematics still not 60fps i think game is not 60fps lol sony.
- I don't want a ps5  Santa Monica: You want a Ps5  - I want a ps5
THE WAIT WAS SOOOO WORTH IT!!!
MUITO BOM LANÇA PRA PC TAMBÉM
I'm just hoping there's a dang Jump Button. The combat looks very similar here, they better have some innovated mechanics in the field of mobility
gg bois!
So Is he related to Thor or something?
I just google up Angrboða who is the female shown in the last few sec of trailer and U guys should do the same. I m insane now
And just like that.. Play station wins again.
I dont like games that just go one way I need to explore where I want
What is this a cross over episode?
Oh the girl prob loki's wife eh
The game looks the same, and I do not vibe with the new Atreus character at all. Cringe if you ask me.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Released Year??? I am ready with my ps5.
ну конечно, куда же без негров в скандинавской мифологии
Everyone's looking at kratos's new moves, but check out atreus silently in the background. He has new explosive/blast arrows, new grab animations, a new runic where he summons a ram and rides it and he can make his bow appear and disappear from his hands, implying some other magical powers he has. This is probably also where a lot of the development time went.
So soon...
Lake of the nine frozen...Fimbulwinter effects
Might not be tyr could be a giant?
Since the title is Ragnarok what's going to happen? Is he going to kill Jormungandr? I feel like that's the true extent of his rage
a different VA cast? Kratos voices seem a bit lighter than before
Vou comprar o PS4 em dezembro ,espera eu ter o PS4 pra poderem lançar essa maravilha dos deuses 😻😎🤩🤩👏
I hope we are not going to play as that ungrateful brat haha
If this game does not come out for PS4 I'm suing.
thor: "are you a calm and reasonable person?"   kratos: "ask athena"
Holy cosmic star chips omega level. Thank you PlayStation 💜❤️💜❤️
Finally a new I been waiting for this too long and wow atreus is older now how old is now 16 or 18
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos: *Remembering bashing the head of Hercules and squashing the eyes of Poseidon while twisted his head* .... No.
Tyr had both arms meaning fenrir could still be unborn or unchained yet as a child of Loki
Мда, выглядит как длс к предыдущей части, на полноценное продолжение за фулпрайс не тянет вообще.
Top demais um dos melhores games!! 👏🏻🙌🏻
Please for ps4
Annoying BOY
We can truly see some god's from olympus
Xbox: We will win E3 2021 PlayStation: Releases Kratos.
🎴
Show
Im a happy and complete man now!
The dislikes are X box users
'You seen like a calm and reasonable person..'  Kratos: "And I took that personally"
Is it ps5 exclusive or will be also for ps4
Hermosooooo <3
He didn't say BOI 😲
How do we go from killing Gods, to fighting man lizards and man horses?
OHDIOS OH DIOS OH DIOS
Loki is gonna be fun to beat up
Yes yes yes yes yes lets gooooooo!
Why is freya holding back her full power doesn't she want to destroy kratos
Grafik masih sama ps4 tapi only ps5 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Atreus: STOP THINKING LIKE A FATHER START FOR A MOMENT AND THINKING LIKE A GENERAL The audience collectively: *B O Y*
Release date please!!!!
I became more of a man just by watching this trailer. An I came four time
I just scream of excitement LETS GOOOOO RAGNAROK
How could many people would dislike this trailer!? There's like 1.3k!!
Now this worth of waiting 4 years😎😎
kratos: you're growing too fast , slow down BOI !
Awesome 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Ps5 ps5 ps5
Can't wait til' this comes to PC in 5-6 years. It's a crime that we're forced to play this on a PS5, it just doesn't do the graphics justice.
cant wait for it to be exclusive
لعبه زربه
Way to spoil Tyr. I would have loved to learn that 2 Gods of War would meet. But whatever. Game seems hype
Cant wait
2022 will be the best year since 2015. Sony and From Software in 1 year is only a win. To be fair. There is no year without Sony lol
MEU DEUS! QUE FODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will it be released on PlayStation 4 too?
I can’t wait for the breakdowns of this trailer !!
There's a video talking about Santa Monica eventually doing an open world game where you play as adult Atreus, who can transform in differemt mythological creatures...honestly sounds amazing!
If only it was built just for the PS5
I don't know why but this trailer reinforces to me the possibility that Atreus will kill Kratos.
Parece un DLC
I'm pretty sure they will make fun of troll boss if there is one of them show up in ragnarok, such as Boi says I thought we already kill all of them?!
Stunning!
Kratos looks like he's still constipated from the last game.
2:12
BOY 2
Это римейк 😂
2:13
Thor is the final boss? Tyr vs Thor? Vanaheim can be accessed now? Hugin and Munin (that two crows/ravens sending info to Odin) being always in backdrop?
THAT LOKI FORSHADOWING THO
On PC please😭
I hope we get to kill Thor with his own hammer.
"Stop thinking like a father for once and act like a general"  shivers down my spine
Tyr being alive is shock enough
Increíble juegazo 👌
I wanna see Loki use spartan rage as like a tag team skill in this game
Aaaaahhahahah
kratos: ya estuve en la boca de un gigante un dragon y ahora un cocodrilo
KRATOS
me acabo de cagar
This surpasses best budgeted movies.
Tyr has both hands?
They forgot to mention the release date :D
Kratos's greatest enemy yet - PUBERTY
Finally! More humans!
2:46 who was that???
Can’t wait to see how the leviathan axe feels with haptic feed back
Finally ps going to have something🤲🏻
So happy to see Mimir, Atreus and Kratos together again! ❤️
Really excited to see how Atreyus plays his role as Loki. And wonder if Kratos will talk about his previous family and tell his son about his sister?
This looks amazing.
Whyyy is it cross-gen? If you don't have a PS5 by the time this releases then oh well, this game looks like DLC rather than a next gen sequel. Stop making games for PS4.
Any ideas on who the girl at the end is?
I hear Thanos...
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and strat thinking like a genera..." *NO!*
2:28 - Kratos is fighting a Light Elf, it seems. Maybe they were the bad guys all along...
3:03 feel like a forced inclusion, hopefully it wont ruin the game
20 bucks says tyr turns out to be odin is disguise
Yes ooo.... I thought the GOW series will end with the last one.... This is amazing... Nice one Sony
CARALHOOOOOO
no tengo la play 5 😔
From Vietnam love this game
1:52 Kratos is holding the bag that Carried Fayes ashes.
Kratos, obrigado por me tirar da depressão!
I'm just excited for Freya.
Looking forward to Tyr calling Kratos “boy” in the sequel
I love how manliest this game is.
ولله الي يخاذ اكسبوكس معوق  😂😂💔
Okay for real are you coming with us?
I’ve been waiting for this
♥️♥️♥️
Looks incredible
At least they've showed much more than spider-man-2....
When do y'all think it comes out? I think mid 2022, correct me if I'm wrong
Hoy me rasuré y me ha vuelto a crecer la barba.
Ps4
Wow, VISUAL PART IS THE TRUE "NEXT-GEN" !!
Tyr is an absolute unit
Apparently thor's gone be a big ol thicc boi. Like thiccer than endgame thor.
YO! there are Shield customizations! I just noticed after  watching for the 3rd time
I can't be the only one who thought that thor was voiced by josh brolin.
YESSSSSSSIRRRRR
Why does Odin s uncle sound Irish? I mean both are germanic language
اول عربي يشهد الاعلان.......دييييم
"Are you a calm and reasonable person...then you haven't tried Bang Energy drink!" (throws the boy a Gymshark tank top)
Xbox dudes punching the air rn 💀
The Boi is coming
Kratos + giants v ragnarok? Lessgo
Genial 💥
Quisiera un mundo mas extenso no uno tan accidentado cómo el primero por eso q ese mundo no me gustó mucho
Chale si con un niño la tuvo pesada...no me imagino criando a un adolescente jajajajaja
We will definitely see kratos's axe breaking thor's hammer
Boy is no longer boy, he is teenager now
“I have lived in the shadow of the gods for long enough! The time of the gods has come to an end!” Feels just like yesterday, yet here we are 🚶🏼🚶🏼
Tyr Tyr Tyr Tyr Tyr Tyr Tyr Tyr.. now I want to listen to the band Tyr  XD
Wow
Cant wait but it really looks like a dlc.
How can that be Tyr? Didn’t Tyr lose his arm to Fenrir ? Or is it yet to happen?!?!?
Kratos looks grim so he's gonna meet everything grim....
LET'SSSS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
more deep emotion with characters
"You seam like a calm and reasonable person." Kratos: 2:04
Playstation Overrated garbage
HYPE HYPE!!!
this tall man just intimidates kratos
Why does Thor's VA sound so familiar, I heard him elsewhere, can't put my finger on it. Either way I am EXCITED, hope it is released for PS4 too!!
The ragnarok is coming
Please ragnarok on ps4 sony🔥
No one one can beat this game 🙌🏼 And music is sooooo serously full of emotion 🔥
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” …  “Matt Damon!”
JODEEEEEEEEER
NO
That two wolf is sköll and hati I think
This game is gonna blow up, in 4 hours there is already 1 million views.
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Idk, ask your sons.
I wonder what Atreus says to convince Kratos to leave the house and search for Tyr maybe its the fact that Thor shows up that makes him want to find out the best ways of surviving Ragnorok.
I want in the ps4
I'm drowning in nut right now
Game of the Year
ps4 pro waiting!
The two wolves they use as transport, I wonder, are they Hati and Sköll?
Shame hardly anyone will get to play it seeings there are no ps5’s for sale.
The Graphics are just insane, how beautiful did that wolf sled part of the gameplay look!
I thought Tom Holland was voicing the boy
this kinda grows on me man
Boy
How on earth could any self respecting gamer pass on all these exclusives and get an Xbox??
The combo with blade of chaos makes me sick
Boy: "Hey, Tyr! I dare you stick your arm inside the mouth of that huge wolf over there!"
💯🔥
He doesnt say Boiii anymore :((
Kratos : Tyr.... Your hand still exist
I was wondering why there was so many dislikes...       I bet it's the inclusion of (Odin forbid...) a Black girl in Norse Mythology                                                                                                                😑 SMH  Update:  Yeah it's because she's black...
Atreus's voice does not suit very well in my opinion. But the hype is real.
I'm excited about the lore, game play seems identical to the previous game. I hope I'm wrong and they bring better game play in this game. I loved the previous one but I want more and better epicness.
0:44 Freya, the crazy Ex Girlfriend
Wow..... Tyr!!!!!
The best
Yes bois…atreus is a squeeker.
Graphics seem same as 2018 gow
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" *Olympus has entered the chat*
please release the soundtrack
This looks great, but it kind of looks exactly like the old one. Probably because it started as a PS4 game.
Is it the same voice actor for Atreus?
I feel like that little girl in the end is odin in Disguise
Me voy a matar si esto no está en Ps4 igual, 1er aviso.
I really hope this game has more boss fights.
Take my money!
3:07 girl is lokis slash artreus  future wife . Angrboda
Mimir is like Atreus's uncle.
Estaba esperando Kakaroto.....Este momento.......SIEMPRE LO ESPERE!!!!!!
If Kratos has Zeus armour as default, then you can easily defeat enemies and bosses pretty quickly. In just 2 or more minutes
I'm pretty sure that's Eqypt in the last scene there. Already traveling to other pantheons are we??
Will this be on the ps4 too? Because I don't have a ps5 yet
This was clearly intended for fans of the 2018 version because this offers nothing new at all. Enjoy I guess.
THE GIRL IS FROM OTHER CULTURE?????
This is going to turn into one of the biggest RPG fantasy games ever. There is so many amazing twists I never even thought of. A whole new map aswell.
Ohhhh shiiid
Lame
Meu pai vende pamonha e me bate com sabugo😓
I have a feeling this game will be a game of the year too
The Boy has grown
🤯🤯🤯🤯
That enemy variety is TASTY!
"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY!!!! WE'RE MAKING THAT TOOTH FAIRY OUR NEW COMRADE!"
Finalmente o trailer saiu, que jogo magnífico!
We just got a look at Vanaheim in the last few shots!
Atreus grown up a little bit
Hype hype hype hype!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Jeez the soundtrack 🙌
Kratos el peor ;)
Thor: Are you a calm reasonable person? Kratos: Define calm and reasonable.   Mimir: Well it Probably means you can walk in to and out of a tense situation with out blood and gore everywhere or not altering landscapes.   Kratos: I see…I shall say no then
Hey Dad wanna play catch? NOOOO!!
Tyr standing up gave me chills bruh 👀👀
Xbox and PC Fanboyz are crying.
Nooooo no  me digan que la chica del final es la hija de kratos? O solo estoy  alucinando
Is it for ps4 to?
Oh my Zeus! this looks amazing 👀😳😍 my mind and body is ready! Game of the Year contender again. Thanks to everyone at Santa Monica Studio for this during these trying times with covid-19 😩😒
Quem é essa mulher do final do vídeo, ela não tem características nórdicas 🤔
Finally
I can't wait to watch walkthroughs again
Diomiojesu! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
amazing
Cannot wait for some more Axe throwing action!!!!
Did anyone get vibes of Josh brolin after listening to thor 😂😂 say "are you a calm and reasonable person"
I feel like that girl at the end is Calliope
Curious that Tyr hasn't lost his hand, really excited for this game
I hope there is no killing in this game, its scury
Saquenlo para PC culeros.
Can't wait to fight Valkyrie Queen.
Super
3:03   SHIIIIEEETTTTTT
My only dream is play gow 5
Atreus better not be a spoiled brat this game
WELCOME ABOOOOOOOOARD THE HYPE TRAAAAAAAAAAAIN!
Game of thrones writers should take notes
Stop thing like a dad and start thinking like a noo
coroi o kleitão ta de volta
BOY
Atreus is grow upp😭
FREAKING GREAT.
I dont know Rick, looks like repost
It's annoying that freya is an antagonist in this game after it was her own actions that led to Baldur being f'ed up. It was her fault, now she wants to kill us?
This is gonna be great
Disappointed dad and boy are back! Nice to to know drunk uncle head is here too!
KLAITON VAI TA GROSSO!
Wait who was that at the end?
Seems Atreus is as annoying as before.
Was that the girl from polar express???
i cant wait to hear kratos to shout ""BOY"" more than 10 times in 1 min
Who is? 2:47
Here's to hoping we can work things out with Freya
They don't want him to become the ghost of Sparta again lol
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  *Zeus punching bag flashbacks*
Exclusive Games by Sony or Nintendo always push boundaries so much <3 Sony has been smashing out exclusives and they look better than pretty much all the cross platform titles : )
.. NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST, IT'S LOOKS A GREAT WITH FULL OF REVENGE ..  GET BACK ON YOU KRATOS .. 💙    🖤  IIXBANONA70XII   🖤
Man this game is like going to be great, like REAL great.
Wen do we Pre order for this am tired of waiting 😂😂😂
Imagine being a Xbox stand and trying to hate on this. Man.
Ooh boi this gonna be EPIC!!!
Aww mannn🔥..i just can't waitt
2:14 Berserker?
Kratos i lovee youu so much
Miss the BOY!
Can’t wait hope it has post game content and expansions and puzzles
Tyr: "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos:"searching on Wikipedia and sees all of the bad things he had done." "Yes."
Caracaaa tava mt anciosooo pra ver esse trailerrrrr aaaaaaa🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When you want to release a cinematic trailer like others but realise the gameplay is cinematic anyway
I need this game on pc rn
Hope they do it like the last game and have no camera cuts. Loved that about the previous one.
Nose ingles pero tuvo weno
Most excellent! More enemy variety, the old gang is back and they are not spoiling set pieces yet, bring it!
Ufffff abemus goty❤️
They rescue Tyr only to set free loki, predictable nice but predictable 😅
Playstation got me screaming, queefing, and downright squirting
This has hyped me up in so many ways. I can’t wait
I cannot afford PS5. Please, don't be an exclusive for PS5.
BOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!
The dislikes are from PC players
i am a microsoft and xbox fanboy, but i need a ps5 now!
Woooah… the new girl In the trailer is angrboda…Loki’s love and the mother of hel, fenrir and the Midgard serpent….YESSSSSSSSS👏🏾
Kratos to Tyr: "I thought you'd be bigger"
Top de mais.👏👏 Mal vejo a hora de poder jogar🤩🤩
Im just happy mimir is still kicking
No maaaameeeeeeeees no mameeeeeeeeeeees🥵
At the beginning when atreus was carrying the deer, it kind of looked like loki with the horned helmet
*Boy*
THEY ADDED BLACK PEOPLE!!!!!!
Woaaaaa
The music in this trailer goes hard, especially at 2:14
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general. Kratos: Ok. *Kratos's skin gets whiter*
Can't see the best trailer like this..😘😘😘
The Little Girl at the end gotta be Angrboða the mother of Fenrir, Hel, and Jörmungandr!. Which Is Loki's lover which is Atreus!. Or she's Sigyn Loki or Atreus's future wife!.
Asgard is well and truly f*cked 😂🔥
YESSS
Who was the guy towards the last scene shackled up?
This game is gonna make me buy a PS5
MEU DEUS EU VOU CHORARRRR
Love how Atreus is instantly shown ominiously with horns like Loki.
Alguien más piensa que Kratos morirá a manos de su hijo como el mato a su Padre
THE HAPPINESS I FELT WHEN I SAW THIS TRAILER IS UNMATCHED
meee 7/10
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!
Mimir was writing with his mouth, on a table.
Valkyrie at the END 👀👀
Just when i thought i was out,they pull me back in
Boy is now Man
Sony made my night with this one! Can’t wait!! 😍🥵🔥
AAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Can’t wait!
No mameeeeesss🥵🥵🥵🥵
I swear the smug black women is 2020's bald space marine at this point i'd kill for a bald space marine.
Can’t wait!
can't wait to see kratos go to asian mythology after this
E3 2021 crowd reaction Covid19 : nahhh..
On one hand, I'm sad that this is the last of the Norse saga but I'm excited to see where we go next.
Now i need to buy my ps5
Im crying
siiiiiiiii !!!!!!
I wished to see a whole different gameplay with ps5 and stuff. It looks exactly like the previous game, like a dlc or something…
Man....oooh man....no words could express the anxiety to play this master piece. Kratos, THE most bad f**** a** character off all times! That music, the thrill of combat! Please 2021 go away an let 2022 come...with the WINTER!!!!
OH MY LORDY LORD :DDD
Thor sounds like Jeffrey Dean Morgan lol
Looks like the boy (my son) is going to have to let me borrow his ps5
2:25 who is he?
🔥
I miss the gore and brutality of the Greek saga. I liked the last GoW but got tired of the environment pretty quickly. Rocks, caves, snow, ruins... except for the witch house area and the elven realm, I really wanted to be somewhere else. I want colorful, exotic locations. And I want the over-the-top gore back!
Holy F***! This game looks amazing!
so many new characters!!
No more "BOY" quotes?
AMAZING
PlayStation jus stay winning
Is Atreus voiced by the same kid?? If so, I feel old now lol
Mamadisimo 🏹🖤🔥
مترقب وبقوة لهذي التحفه!
SIIII SIIII JODER ME CAGO EN TODO ES MAS HERMOSO QUE LA DEMOCRACIA
Mamadisimo 🏹🖤🔥
It looks more like a dlc of gow 4 but hope it'll blows me when it release coz I have high expectations from gow
Puede que atreuz tenga novia jeje
PS5s need to restock bruh
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Oh yeahh
La verdad le estaba perdiendo el Interes pero con este trailer uff mi amorcito xd
What if Kratos could wield the Mjolnir once he defeated Thor, that be some Storm Breaker and Mjolnir epicness
oğlan ölse de eski intikam isteyen Kratos gelse artık
Kratos is such a BADASS!!
War is not the only way" _ Kratos
KratosGOD siuuuuuuuuuuu
Pues me sorprendió más el primer tráiler de Kratos de play 4  Esperaba que atreus estuviera mas mamada, pero seguro lo estará en el final :D
And the game of the year goes to...
Ps4??
Wow these graphics. Kinda makes my 4K gaming PC feel a bit overpriced. But we'll have to see if they pull any Ubisoft style downgrades on the release version of the game. AC Valhalla was unable to run at native 4K on consoles. But I feel maybe a Sony exclusive might try a bit harder to optimize the 4K performance of their games.
Wasn’t gonna say anything but I don’t know what that last clip was, but I’m just gonna assume Santa Monica is going the way of all game studios lately. Not excited for the title
is it a DLC?
I wonder what Gods Kratos will kill
Pc
Veo que Atreus obtuvo un "che moment" xd.
ARE YOU COMMING WITH US
Ragnarok has begun!!!
GARATOOOOOOO
THOR: ARE YOU A CALM AND A REASONABLE PERSON ? KRATOS: ASK THE GODS OF OLYMPUS THOR : THERE IS NO OLYMPUS GODS KRATOS : EXACTLY
Hype is too high right now  I hope the Dualsense makes the game even way more further than better 🤩
Try and find a ps5 now 😩
Put4 madre lo quiero. Es como cuando salió el halo reach 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Esse jogo vai ser foda!
Thor: you seems like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?   Kratos: L3+R3😡
3:05 Типичная скандинавка.
Starting with "I'm gonna kill the Gods of Olympus" and now "Can we stop Ragnarok?", What a great character development!
aaaaaahhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHH
🤯🤯🎊🎊🎉🎉🥳🥳
Porraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Best🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que belleza 👌👌 Santa Mónica
Kratos saaaapeeee!!
Azupotamdr3
Tyr 😱😱😱 he was one-armed!!
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESh
This is how next gen works, Cockstar!  Took everything what was previously great and even improved it. What a beautiful game. I cant wait...
I see Tyr still have his right hand , so i hope we will see fenryr along the way and he will lose it so we can defeat it xD
Please release it
THIS. IS. IT.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?"  "BOI" Kratos said calmly.
es fanatica de lo sensual ella tiene una foto mia y no me la puedo imaginar lo qu ehace cuando esta solita pero no le voy a preguntar
Sony please add themes back. I really want a Ragnarok theme for ps5 and you mine as well bring web browser back, you have internet options in settings but no app.
Would these interesting games be on ps4 as well or no
I want to see Surtur as he towers over the mountains and burns the world. 👹🔥🔥🔥
That tall guy at the end better be careful standing up to kratos like that. Hercules did the same and got his face beat in.🤣🤣
Se me estremeció un poco el nudo del globo 😍
I kind of hope for the blade of Olympus to be in this game
LOVE THIS!!!!
I don't know why I watch these announcements and new console stuff knowing I could never afford it
Atreus is like a girlfriend that tries to get you into a fight with a guy who happens to have a gun.
Wow 🤩👌🏻
Are you a calm and reasonable person? *Remembers when Kratos used a Women as a door stop*  Mind defining calm and reasonable?
Esto es orgásmico
Are you a calm and reasonable person? ARE YOU?!
Estoy llorando de emoción lpm
Fk yes let gooooooooooo!!!!! It final here
okay but where Jörmungandr these days? haha
I don’t know if this is me but it seems like kratos is getting more violent in this trailer maybe in this game or the next we will see him snap
So it's basically the same game copy and pasted
I'm looking forward to seeing Kratos vs Dominic Toretto
Finally a game with actual next-gen gfx.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMM PORRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
They showed too much and too little at the same time.
I pray to got we get a Kratos vs OG Kratos with the old actor secret boss!
That is what I like to see
Freya must be crazy to hurl herself at Kratos, The destroyer of Greek Pantheon like that.
Y la fecha??
Why do I have a feeling kratos is gonna fight tyre
2:50 gods of War💙😧🤍
I can't wait to watch this on YouTube
Agradecido por seguir vivo para experimentar esta obra de arte de saga
AAAAAAAAA A FODAAAAAAA  FINALMENTE KKK
I hope this game gets delayed soo they can perfect it
Finally something to be excited about.
TA PORRA 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
What's with the girl at the end
Let's gooooooooooooooo!!!
YOOOOOOO
pony console 5 for the win !
Is ragnarok coming to ps4?
“It’s the final countdown”
This trailer feels too spoilery, I mean they showed Kratos and Atreus finding Tyr just like that.  I wished I could restrain myself from watching trailers.
1 word.. Sick!!!
Oloko Tyr!
Take my money
This wasn't as thrilling as gow 4
I would have been happier if you’d dropped the ssd expansion update.
Yes For PS4 Pro too!
NO release date? When is it coming out? 😐
we trust in cory
LETS GOOOOOOOO
One of the reasons I'm a happy owner of a PlayStation.
Love Boy's silhouette as he walks into the cave.
Is that really Tyr? Isn't he supposed to be missing a hand?
i would love a ps5 in order to play this...
Where the f is the release date
Compare these graphics with hellblade. Looks worse than halo infinite
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
“Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general” BOI you have no f***** clue!!
Finally, all those women Kratos impregnated in the past are coming to haunt him with child support 😆
uffff *se moja*
This makes me proud to own a PS5
I won't even play it
THE GRAPHICS LOOK JUST LIKE PS4!!!!! CROSS GEN GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!
Starting to NOT regret getting a new TV setup for my PS5.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos:.... Define calm.
BOY 😍
Surprised they mentioned this game would close out the Norse saga. I would have thought they'd go for the trilogy.
An still no reales date but soo happy
3:04 claro la inclusión nunca debe faltar   -__-
I like how @ 3:30 what she says is towards us
Kratos finally got his deer!
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: well potato potaato just need context.
Rent can wait. TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Boy has become a Man now
Sorry. I hate to be that guy, but it must feel bad realising how stupid you are buying an xbox instead of a ps5. Sony crushed everything with that presentation🫂
oooooooh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah bring  it on!!!!
Tyr morreu e foi jogar no Vasco!
Haha looks the same as GOW 2018, KOTOR stole this show, not this overrated game.
Well my theory of Kratos being Tyr just got destroyed
Atreus: stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general !!!! Kratos: No !!! (While Slaying Monsters and Bosses)
Was that Josh Brolin speaking as Thor?
Atreus: stop thinking like a father for a moment and think like a general   Cratos: WHAT?!!
George Clooney, lol
If only I could get a ps5…
Nice.
So Kratos is not Tear…..or
Haha..Tyr!!!
Ah yes GBG Goin to kiss Thor With his Powerful Runics
BOY
Game of the decade sadly
i can't wait😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Boy" sure has grown up. sheeeesh! they grow up so fast lol!
Poggers
Facinante como deseo jugarlo
Gg
I don't feel like it's a next-gen graphics, it's same graphics as the last game !
Same gameplay,,,, SHAME !!!
AWESOOOME
can't wait for this
Sony me da um Ps5 pra jogar esse maravilhoso jogo por favor  :(  Sony give me a Ps5 to play this wonderfull game pls :(
Anyone think that kratos looks younger? Think its abit weird? Also why did they show tyr I mean🤦‍♂️
I think that the Gods might target atreus since they believed that he will bring ragnarok to them, and maybe they will successfully kill him, little did they know that kratos was the one who will bring ragnarok. The foreshadowing tho bout being general once again
Как всегда на высоте Батя Кратос. 💪💪💪💪💪💪
'Are you a calm and reasonable person?' He asks to the man who literally has a Spartan Rage meter
Tyr where your hand at???? Or is that Odin????????....Or Loki????
Make no mistake I loved it but it seems a dlc!
cool
Hey is the Tyr Peter Stormare
915k 927k
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: L3+R3
Just saying my family and friends are not going to see when this game comes out
"start thinking like a general"  son you want to get murdered by me too huh?
Kratos didn't say ''BOY'' once?
HYYYYYYYYYYYYPE !!!!!!!
I LOVE THE OST
Lo que vete ahorrando para pagar 10 pavos por las actualizaciones fuerte robó locoo
From the teaser, it is great, but frankly, I don't feel next-gen progress so much ,obviously,Horizon 2 is more like next-gen work than this
ah here we go again, buying a PS just for GoW
pleas tell me it not 90 dollar
Just wanna take a second to scream about Angrboda, and the sign that there might be more giants out there. Maybe that’s why Odin hid Tyr away, because he saved some of the giants from him?
Oooooooo siii!!
Who's the big guy in the in of video?
Meu Deus tô ansioso pra ver alguém jogar já que eu não vou conseguir jogar não tenho nenhum console skks
🔥🔥🔥
You seem like a calm and reasonable person......  Yeah sure unless something happens to boy😅
For those who knows about the Norse mythology, who is the little girl who appeared in the end of the trailer?
Tengo pensado q atreus en algun momento mate a kratos sin que el lo quiera, como vimos pintados en la pared, obviamente kratos es un ser que no puede morir por la maldicion que tiene, pero al fin y acabo vuelve de la muerte despues de ser asesinado por atreus
I wonder which mythos Kratos will go wreck after this one...maybe Greek or Sumerian? Or tour East Asia, go Korea-China-Japan.
Kratos is so tired from fighting... bruh let the man rest and have his peace
Now this is something will not disappoint
"I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE" - my bank account in 2022
GREATNESS
Carajo se ofenderan muchos pero lo vi como un DLC del 4,me decepciono un Poco y una negra en tierras nórdicas??
I still can't buy a PS5 at retail price so.....
Welp, RIP Thor lol
Will it be available for PS4?
Hammer vs Axe
did they just spoil the whole game
Yeah, cool.  Now, if only we could actually get our hands on a PS5.  You guys have failed us miserably.
We can clearly see new move sets and skills. And also new weapon hammer is confirmed.  But still some stupid fcuks are complaining about similar gameplay. My thought is, bruh do you want Kratos to fly?
🤩❄️🔥
Kratos faces his toughest challenge - raising a teenage boy
Time for WAAAAARRRRR!!
I can't wait to play it
Kratos vs Thanos , who you got
Thor : You seen like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: why don't you ask Zeus?
I think those two dogs pulling the sled are skoll and hati. Probably won’t have a big influence on the game but still cool  Then again, Ragnarok starts when they catch their prey🤷🏻‍♂️
"I just want answers. "  Probably shouldn't ask why his skin is so pale.
Amazing!
wait if that man is tyr, why he has 2 hands,? i thought he gave it away the other hand  to fenrir when all the GODS tried to shackle the beast? man i cannot wait to see his side quest, armored customs, other loots etc and of course THOR!!!
Epico
i love what kratos become after 7 games. wonderful character development
Ahora mismo la tengo durísima!!!
KRAATOOOS
My hype is immeasurable, and my day is saved.
Best trailer ever
Hey! Is this coming to PS4 too? Someone pls answer 👏
They better make a limit a edition ps5 for this game like the ps4 pro
It’s just me or will Freya will be joining valkiries again later in game??!
Eu te mamo Kratos Quer dizer Amo
Atreus telling Kratos to think more like a general is this foreshadowing old Kratos coming back or is this signifying his growth as a character either way I hope we can double jump in this one
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ps4?
0:45 bro, look at that snow.
Just another year or so...
Does this is also coming in PlayStation 5
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person *laughs in murdering all greek Gods
Atreus should be a little younger, his voice higher pitch and his hair longer.
O nome do jogo tá errado.... (deus da Guerra) 🤦‍♂️ deveria ser matador de deuses assassino veio da p35te
Its sad when you use an old engine for a 2021 new AAA game :(
“ you have to live it” mogged
Please have it on PS4 :(
Did you guys notice that freya was cursed to not harm any creature but in this game she clearly almost made another scar in Kratos face???? This game will be SICK ❤️‍🔥
If is finally here
Wow a race swap guess gow has gone full woke not playing this trash  wish you would stop appropriating my culture and god's and get your own this game is racist.
I like the old savage Kratos I dont think the father thing fits his character
Play Station is on fire 😎
Why is there a black character? In freaking Scandinavian game
please let us play with pc
Hasta que al fin ponen algo bueno, luego de la estafa de ofrecer la godzillesca ps5 edicion sin cobre, sa gente que se dejo estafar pensando que solo saldria en ps5 xd
All the Dislikes are Xbox players.
Muchachos perdón, pero acabo de perder el septiembre sin fap. Me resultó imposible que no se me párese la serpiente del mundo viendo esto
Ysssir it’s about time 😆😆
What theee... TYYRRRRRRRRR
I think that girl at the end is Angrboða, the mother of Loki's monster children
Let’s goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Pleeeeeease tell me Atreus gets a crush on that girl and goes to Kratos for romance advice. Its either going to be really sweet or really funny but either way it'll be great
Congrats! Your B0Y evolved into a TEEN!
If I can literally just buy a Playstation  5, like even find one, I'm in
Another dlc for another best selling game
i need a ps5, now
This, Crash 4, Rachet & Clank, Sackboy, Demon Souls and GT7 are the top for the PS5 for now, and GTA 6 will surely be too
Причина чтобы жить +1
Thor: “Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: *thinks back to a decimated Olympus*
The boy is now a man
Is it just me or did this kinda look like GOW 1.5
Tbh, I don’t think that’s the real Tyr. Isn’t he supposed to be missing an arm that Fenrir bit off? It can be Odin shapeshifting to spring a trap.
I...teared up when I saw it..I have been waiting and waiting~ I can't wait to get my hands on it...I want it so badly..
NOW THIS IS GAMING!
Quin, 9 de set de 2021
Como explico los tres orgasmos que me dieron viendo esto
XDDD
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
i needed to see this.
More of the same
Cleiton tá mais brabo aí ainda
OH YEAH IM GETTING THIS
Why kratos looks so skinny 😢
Espectacular
hype climaxxxing
Ps4?
Atreus is the future 🌊🤴❄️
Is it only on ps5? Or the twice. Please tell me
Why i feel That GBG Is the one using kratos for this tráiler
😊
3:03 - Zendaya..?
Is Marvel's 🤯🎮👌
AAAAAAAAAAAHH
Well, here we go again... Te amo, Kratos!
I think the big GOW game ll come much later. This looks like an upscale resolution of GOW in PS4 Pro. Like a DLC or expansion. However can't wait to play it!
this is sick
RIP Xbox 😁
Oh me vengo
More Gore!!!!!!
Spiderman no way home after see the tráiler of Ragnarok: "*visible frustation*"
Kratos is looking at that Hammer like "it would be ashamed if you were to lose that Hammer of yours"
Oooooooooooooohh daddy I'm soooo hyped for this games
Looks amazing, but i expected a little better presentation.
You already know the beginning is gonna be the main menu, I can already see the  “Continue” “Load game”
Triste eu estou , logo agora que meu Playstation 4 queimou a saída de HDMI..........
Is Thor voiced by Josh Brolin? And also Kratos' 2 wolves seem symbolic of the 2 wolves who chase the sun in Norse mythology
Goosbumps wont stop, I know it will be a masterpiece
comment section this days are so cringe. just a bunch of nauseating jokes. Only few wants to discuss the topic,
I hope they also released this game in ps4 cuz i can't afford ps5
Holy moly
Finally!!!
I can’t wait 😭😭😭
yeeeeeEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
🔥🔥🔥💯
I hope he's able to jump this time without it being action jump only
finally atreus hit puberty
Kratos messi
Dá ultima vez que Kratos recrutou deuses antigos para ajuda-lo , não deu muito certo
Freya look a little different aye
Just take my wallet.
Was that the voice of Mark Hammil?
Sony sort it out I want a PS5 and I have done since the day they came out
I was actually hoping for something new and some changes especially in gameplay but I lost all my hope now and what's up with Disney voice acting for the kid.
Man these games all look amazing. I'd love to play them *cry's in no ps5
Les gooooooo
AhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhYesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
AIAIAAIAIAIAIAII
Can’t wait!!!!
Phhhhhhh
Was that zues 2:53 😨
kratos
0:17 Anyone else notice the position of the stag's horns in Atreus's sillouette?
INCREDIBLE!!!!!! 😱
Kratos vs Thor  Gonna be epic 🔥🔥🔥
Seeing Atreus on that spirit stag messing up enemies is badass. I hope there are tons of new combat additions like that.
i know a lot of people will disagree but i really want to see the blade of Olympus somehow in this, other than that AM HYPED
will be for ps4?
Hold up man, does this mean kratos isn’t gonna call Atreus boy?
Tem dois bom de guerra agr
It all looked incredible... until that end. Ruined everything.
"Are you a calm and reasonable person"  Cue montage of Kratos not being a calm and reasonable person.
😱😱😱😱
Kratos finally made a friend??? Tyr better not betray him
.
Kratos es la verga en cualquier universo y reino
3:06 Ig de la Minita? 🎩🍷🧐
boy....you became...Man
So, Atreus is now a teenager.
Aight, now I want a PS5.
Are we watching gow 2018 director's cut I guess or am I wrong?🤔
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Maeeeeeeeeeeeee siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Does anyone know anything about release date?
Boy doesn't need help hunting a deer anymore
2:45 NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! :00000 TYR???!!!!
I’ve never been so disappointed in an announcement trailer
Thor sounding like Thanos out here.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1:12 it reminds me of Gears 5
This is one of the best graphics that i ever saw in a game  Insane
I'm pretty sure the girl from minute 3:04 is Artemis and she's talking to Loki CHANGE MY MIND
Boi is Big Boi now, and he got a girlfriend ~hehe boi meme~ Angrboda
2:25 Imposible.... :"( KratosGOD???
Coming soon pc 2023 )
After Thor is slain Indra is waiting in India and Nepal . Hope they bring next game in Hinduism mythology. Lots of Gods to slain . 🇳🇵🕉️

3:04 I'm in love.
Só na espera por esse jogo lindo !
*BOI*
А кто высокий встал в конце?на английском не понял.
Increible!! 😮😮
and I still haven't played the one before.
BOY! Get me a PS5 Console So we can play this game! XD
Bois voice!!!🤩🙌
Thor: "are you a calm and reasonable person?" Kratos: "I am what the gods have made me"
A ANSIEDADE ESTA A MIL, OBRIGADO PLAYSTATION E SANTA MÔNICA POR ESSE JOGO INCRÍVEL
AAAA LA VERGAAAAAAAAA, te amo Kratos 🇲🇽
🤍🤍🤍
Pls tell me this is also available on PlayStation 4
Need more gods in this game.
😍😍😍😍
Let's hope there is jump bottom
Favourite series of games man no cap
Ps4?
well, so we see tyr, and atreaus love interest, possibly
The only reason I'm gonna buy the ps5
I'm accepting a PS5 as my birthday gift next week.
Where is kratos now ?
Dom: "Kratos... There's nothing more important than FAMILY."
Yesss
Not a day one just buy...I was expecting more I got the same....
I think I just 💩 myself
Solo para ps5? Mierda
The only stuff why I gonna buy a ps5 🤣🤣
nice, but this will look even more amazing on a ps5 pro (which i’ll wait for)
Graphics are better but still people are complaining about graphics and design.
NISTA
Hopefully I can buy a PS5 by the time this comes out.
No one seems to mention frozen Tyr's Temple. We are going back to alfhaim, those were light elves attacking them. Just read an article by Santa Monica, the reason we see Tyrs temple is because we'll be able to travel to all 9 realms!!! There will be new locations of the 6 realms we got to travel in the previous installment!!! So excited!!!
Hermoso
aye lets go ps5
can't wait for atreus to join TVA
The Dad of War is back!
2:01 Josh Brolin (Thanos)?
Not a big diffrient from the old part
Hércules already pulled the "Im taller than you" card on Kratos and look what happened to him lol.
Ouuuuu I’ve been waiting for dis!
GAME OF THE YEAR ♥
Kratos Has entered the chat Tyr Has entered the chat Ragnarok Has left the chat
It's coming it's coming brace yourselves
Someone pick up my Jaws please 😍
he is not a boy anymore
BRUH ATREAUS HIT PUBERTY
Shut up and take my money
Shame I’ll never be able to get a Ps5
Triple H is back! Atreus' new teenage voice is a bit annoying though
❤❤❤
thank you  * cries in happy*
Oh there's no stopping Ragnarok. There's only surviving it
Kratos looks younger than before
Can't wait to watch the full gameplay on YouTube when it's   released 🥲
I wonder how this African found her way to Norse world.
Is It gonna be out for PS4?
Let me guess, the girl in the last scene is Angrboða.  Also, Teen Atreus is kinda weird to me haha.
Ta a mesma bosta do anterior kkkkkkkkkk poneyzinhos tão emocionados
Am I the only one who feels OLD ANGRY KRATOS IS BACK?
Dislikes simply are those who are mentally ill , and of course xbox fan boys 😏😏🙄
Nice to hear Mimrir's new lines.. Honesty laced with a tinge of sarcasm.
😍😍😍
Comon tag team
Thor: "Are you a calm, reasonable person?" Kratos: You haven't played the other GoW games, have you?
Is thanos aka josh brolin voicing Thor?????
Is it just me or thor’s hands looks bit fat
Yoooooo. So many questions. Is Tyr a giant/half giant? Kratos gets new shields. Freya is gonna be a pest throughout this whole game. The combat looks deliciously brutal.
Even tho I don’t own an PS4 or 5. I can say PlayStation has won the console war just give bloodborne ps5 upgrade
Well, fuck...I need me a PS5. Whose face am I going to elbow to get one next year? 😑😑😑
The BOI has become a man.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope Atreus will get old enough in the franchise for him to be a playable characters
Remember we lost the fluid and fast paced game playing of the Original series for Skyrim of war…. Also random diversity character.
A love interest at the end?
Man i wish i have ps5 :')
اكو عرب بل فيديو
Can’t wait for more boat stories
I dunno, something about Boy's voice just seems off. He sounds like a 15 year old but still looks 10. They need to visually age him a little bit
Well... now I need a PS5
IT. IS TIME. RAGNAROK. I wonder what happened to the world serpent? I can't seem to remember lol.
Was hoping to see Atreus a bit older, and I'm not feeling that haircut... But I'm hyped
Ué é o mesmo jogo?
Awebo xd
POR FAVOR QUE TAMBIEN SALGA PARA PS4 PORFAVOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRR
The all father has heard our prayers
Obrigado Cratos por existir !!! Game maravilhoso! Não vejo a hora 🎮🕹️🎮🕹️
3:04 It’s giving Angerboda
I hope Freya isn't just some nuisance character you have to punt away every few missions as she makes several murder attempts 🤣🤣
Boy
Kratos gostoso
Who is the person at the end?
APENAS O MELHOR.
According to Greek mythology(or Dev I guess), gods only become stronger as they r older, which means Kratos is stronger than he was but him controlling his anger is = holding his back Example Greek Kratos power level 500 He use 100% =500 Norse Kratos power level 700 He use 50% =700x0.5=350
3:05 Atreus: it is perfect 😍
I might be the only one feeling this way but I am a little bit disappointed, I really expected more, I don't even know what I expected but this looks like the PS4 Version and we did not see anything amazingly new (especially in the fighting scenes), I hope that I am wrong for this game will be the only reason I will buy the PS5
Visual Blow My Mind.Must Have!
Cant wait
a qui será el fin de Thor
Give kratos a long leather pelt jacket
Can we play it in PS4 someone answer please?
WHEN?!?!?
BOI - Ragnarok Edition
Ps5 only? Noooooooooooo
Tyr, is tallest than kratos,  Kratos:Flahback with Theseus
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Auto buy😍. No doubt
A new kratos quote2:24
Really looking forward to the game, but…this trailer wasn’t hitting as much as I thought it would.
it's a dlc right ?
Fuego asf 🔥🔥🔥
It feels like a dlc but I'm glad for more
🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
aamm,   boring
I can't stop watching this!
Classic uaaasauuuuuuu….
that 'NYOO!' is going to be the best meme material.
ΩGOTYΩ
When that intro theme song played in the beginning I instantly got goosebumps
La emoción me gana, ya quiero matar a Thor y ver a loki encontrarse a él
The Greek tragedy of the 21st century continues to amaze with its Norse expansion.
GOTY
Hope this will b on PS4, that's what I got or PlayStation Plus.
the most hype game
Bruh
Chulada de tráiler 😍
We can still call Atreus “Boy”….   right?
ガチヤベェぇぇぇぇぇぇ
GOTY
Congratulations for the game of the year 2022 🙋🏻‍♂️
Nice..but..not ammizing😐
MY GGGGGG
rica la negrita del final anananananshe
When the music starts 😱
When you see a centaur and realize that it’s a Greek mythological creature and not Norse. (2:25)
Boy
it can be in ps4 console to or no???
Just watch Kratos and Atreus flee to Egyptian gods when ragnarok comes
My gamer senses are tingling.
hoy fue un gran dia :D
OBRA MAESTRA!!!!
Ah yes Tyr McDohl
Please tell me this going to be on the PlayStation 4 because I do not want to save up a lot of money to get a five in the future.
EPICO
00:19 you can see shilouete of loki with the horn. Nice touch!
How dare anyone dislike this!!!!
My guy Mimir a standout yet again
WHERE MY SONY PONIES AT?!!!!😃 WE GONNA RIDE INTO THE SUNSET WITH THESE BANGERS!!! lol
Mais um que será platinado 100%.
Ninguém:  Peter: 67 fatos sobre o Ragnarok que passaram despercebidos no trailer de GoW
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Kratos - L3+R3
The evolution of Kratos 😍
NETA QUE CHINGOOOOOOO!!!!.JPG
Kratos: Hey I don't want to kill gods and got to war. Stupid fan: oh man Kratos must really wanna kill gods and go to war!
Fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
So glad that Kratos didn’t decide to just toss  mirmir off a cliff. He was one of best parts of last game in my opinion
The best game of all time gets a sequel about ragnarok literally what more could you want
Start thinking like a general  No, Kratos said calmly
❤❤
I'm going to guess that the girl at the end is angrboda
На ps 4 выйдет ?
Wow
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So I’m guessing this is going to lead into African mythology and gods concidering the ethnicity of the character at the end. Or was that just the token black character?
А какой год релиза?
Пушкааааа
Is It coming to PS4?
is it exclusive for ps5 only or for both ps4,ps5 ?
Graphically it looks just like the PS4 one to me. Even has frame drops in the trailer. Wondering if this is a PS4 and PS5 release
Ouai ces un dlc quoi
MAL POSSO ESPERAR PRA JOGAR ESSE JOGO + o BRKSEDU!!!
I better see the Blade of Olympus.
Uau!
estoy listo para escuchar las historias de mimir mientras voy en barco
Ps4?
OMFG
Quedé :0
Extraordinário
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
can't wait for some youtuber to play the game since ion have the console 😭😭
А дата то когда? 😅
i can not wait
Nice low key Loki foreshadowing @ 0:21
El Atreus se esta poniendo bueno
DOPE, been waiting for this. still waiting
That opening with the silhouette looking like Loki is wearing the headpiece... I can't wait for this game.
Chances for the PS4 version is very low... :( What a great trailer by the way. Probably best overall game of 2022 or 2023...
saya tidak bisa berkata apa-apa 😱🤩
3:05  World Serpent: Hi mother!
Atreus reminds me of Jaden Smith in this trailer and i don’t know why 😂
Solo va Aser disponible para ps5 o también para ps4
RIP XBOX
Just like that, PS5s became completely impossible to find once again.
THE AMOUNT OF HYPE I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS OVERWHELMING.
Oh My! 😳🥺😱😭🤯🤠🥳🤓😎😁😁🥰😍🤩🖤❤️💛💚🖤
very cool!
Odin : i Heard someone beat Thor badly. Who!!!? Guard : Tyr and Kratos Allfather Odin : Ohhhh (packing to run)  Edit :  He still holding his wife ashes bag. Kratos still thinking about his wife.
Bring gore back and actually fun bosses for this dlc at least
Oh man I was so convinced that Kratos is/becomes Tyr
If Thor only knew what Kratos did to the Greek pantheon. That's not a fight you want to pick.
Oh man awesame
Los llorones de xbox están dando dislike mientras lloran🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
so? WHEN?
Tiene los mismos gráficos :/
Truly a masterpiece and can't wait for release date.  But please redo heavenly sword
I'm happy that Freya is back, i only hope that Kratos doesn't kill her after all she was only protecting her son
Esto me recuerda muchísimo a gear of war 5 en donde tenían el trineo para moverse por el mundo libre jaja
Fracao
Atreus: "Tyr ..."  Myself: "Asgard is f*cked"
Horizon, Sifu and this!
OOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
O kur…
Now Kratos has to call him Man... They grow up so fast :')
Isn't Tyr supposed to have one arm? Or it will happen?
The boy is still not ready
I really wanna see Zeus once more
2:21 1:54 2:00 2:24 2:18 0:41
Siiiiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuu
CADE A DUBLAGEM VAMO Q VAMO GAROTO
Te amo, Santa Monica. Pinche a compañía espectacular 🥰
They better put the jump button just like the old GOW games
Atreus has finally grown up?! Whoa!
It lacks blood, I only see a lot of orange marmalade and sprinkles
SHOW DE BOLA
Glad my boy Mimir still here, won’t be the same without him.
An absolute perfection of a series
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!!
I have a lot of questions wow
Tiene que ser mio
Que maravilha! E por coincidência estou lendo o livro Mitologia Nórdica de Neil Gaiman.  Recomendo demais para quem gostou deste trailer e do último GOW.
@2:49 Gods of War
LOOK AT BOY! IS BIG BOY NOW
Lá vai eu comprar um ps5...
So we not gonna talk about the new prospect for Atreus 👀🤔
Teen atreus kinda sounds like sora
When is it coming out??
take your time to give us another masterpiece
Aleluia 🙌 Deus da guerra tá voltando porra....🙈🙌 ❤️
Please realise as soon I can wait
This is a DLC then
I just have one question:                                                                                      "WHEN?"
does anyone got Captain America's post credit scene "Be patient" vibes when the girl in the ending said "You'll get your answer soon"?  like they're sayin "we'll tell you when this game will come out soon"??
I am 100% confident that this will be our last game with Kratos. Feels like the end of the road for him. Can't wait!
Release? Please tell me the date
Is that calliope at the end?
SHEEEEEEEESH
🤤🤤🤤🤤
OMFG, Amazing!
Very disappointing that Corey Barlog not directing this, didn’t know that
MAKE PS5’s AVAILABLE AT RETAIL PRICE AGAIN!!!  Put out all these trailers with beautiful graphics but only for consumers that got the PS5…  A lot of us loyal customers that have been here from the beginning couldn’t even get one… now stores are carrying them but for $1,000 ?!  Help me make sense of that bs lol
Yo instead of Valkyries let’s have kratos’s kids from the brothels/Aphrodite QTE
The asgardian goddess of diversity and BLM at 3:04. Ahahahhahahah.
I can see Xbox and PC users switching to ps5 🤔
Kid is annoying as ever
Why is Kratos trying too be clam do the Nores Gods not care about Baldur?
uh😫
Thor is about to get Pwnd.
How tall y’all think tyr is?  lol
Me encanta que el gameplay parece ser el mismo, tal vez con alguno que otro cambio pero igual eso esta genial
Saldrá para ps4
Looks like a DLC, not graphics upgrade either, even so I'll buy at launch
Shut up and take all my money
Kratos is no longer Dad of Boi, he’s now Dad of Teenage Boi!
When i saw a viking teleport in front of Kratos, that means we're fighting asgardians now
2:07 Sure...sure...
Que haya sangre
Next year i Will buy ps5 just for this game
Use tyr to travel to asgard and kill oden
😍😍😍
Soy de Xbox pero este va ser un tremendo juegazo que lo disfruten los de play
O.o!!!! this....will....be....EPIC!
lame the graphics look the exact same. I would have preferred if they took a few more years to make it as a next gen exclusive
PlayStation >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Makes millions of dollars off Norse mythology. > Replace the ethnic group who created that mythology with Africans because racists don’t believe Norse are worthy of representing themselves.  >Not a single of these racial justice warriors care because their  fight against racism was in truth only a fight for black supremacy.
Yes, its beautiful😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow
💩😹
this game is only for ps5?
2:08 Does anyone even know why that hammer is better than the one in that Avengers cartoon? Not even a scholar in Norse mythology can tell you why it is that shape.
Hey, You people smell that? Yes, smells like another GOTY Master piece.
is sunny back as aterus ?
I got goosebumps
Only for ps5? Ps4 too?
Quien es la persona que aparece al final
This is intense
Why is there a black girl?
Bruh. That girl in the end...is that Calliope?
When is the release date?! “You’ll get your answers soon enough…” Does Kratos kill Thor? “…Well, some of them.”
The voice at 2:00...that's Josh Brolin isn't it? Wow wow wow
AAAHHH
ремейк прошлой части с дополнениями,печально((
Épico
So Atreus/Loki is trying to prevent the Ragnarok by fighting the Aesir, that his son Fenrisúlfr is supposed to begin because Fenrir will want to avenge himself and his father (which is Loki) as a vengeance against the Aesir who do not want the Ragnarok to happen?
Josh Brolin?
GOTC (Game Of The Century).
Anybody notice Atreus now has blades at 1:48?
Black girl in Asgard...
Where is the date?... to me it's smoke, until the date comes out.
Que hermosura de videojuego 😳
3:06 why? "DIVUUURRRCITEEEEE" You're a nutless **ssy until you dare doing that with a white character in a non white mythology.
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥
Vai ser epicooo
2:27 that is a light elf...
I have never been more hyped just from a trailer
It looks great… probably could’ve fit on a ps4 though :P
Now i have a reason to buy a PS5
Hype!.  I somewhat don't hope there's a special edition ps5 though because I know I'd luck out and wind up having to pay a scalper for the privilege of owning one of them.
Who disliked this? Honestly why?
Wait... Did I hear Josh brolin as Thor???
Thor: "are you calm and reasonable person?"  Kratos: "sure"  OG Fans: "ZEUSSSSS!!!!"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Santa monica did it again
oh my gawd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is it available on ps4?
porra essse game ta muito foda,  quero joga o de 1089, imagina esse foda de mais
This feels more like a movie trailer
aaaaaaaaaaaa
And we thought Kratos was big
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
s eme paro la pingaaaaaaaaqa
The girl is played by Zendaya?!
I just can't wait for the game to come out . I'm so F excited aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
BOI!
Espero y ver en todo en su esplendor a la verdadera Reina de las valquirias y también a Thor
Mmmmm
Why’d they add a girl, it was only suppose to be the BOIS
Os cara vão voltar no tempo nuuuuu
LETS GO BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally! My boy Kratos is back at it! Hypetrain!!!
Is it me or does Kratos look like Triple HHH
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: Omae wa mou shindeiru. Thor: Nani?
Angrboda is black? Didnt read that in the sagas. Maybe they should make Kratos go to africa or something, probably some african gods there he can kill.  And lets make some of them white while we are at it, im sure the africans wont mind.
Will it be just in ps5?
* clears throat * GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kratos mad! Atreus got tattoos on the neck without permission.
2:48 I feel like Kratos is talking to us at this moment . *chills*
Looks cool but revealing Tyr was a bit spoilery
When?
Black girl in Scandinavia. Where's the Mexican, Chinese, and Pakistani? Only right if we're going to make this as accurate as possible to old, mythical scandinavia. MIRITE? Not enough diversity checkboxes.
Who's the little girl at the end ?
"War is not the only way."  The name of the whole series of the game: Am I a joke to you?
pliss ps 4
Disappointed haven’t heard "boi" in this trailer 😓
dayuuuuum <333
NOSSA ESSE JOGO VAI SER FODA DEMAAAAAAAAAIS!
why does that sound like josh brolin playing thor
Is this an update or a new game ?
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” Kratos: *Ask Greece.*
I’ll either have to give up my Xbox or PS4 just to play all these new games that are exclusively for the PS5.
Bill Goldberg and Gage Goldberg
E de arrepiar o cabelo do toba
2:22 YOOO isnt that a Cipactli from Aztec Mythology
I hope kratos won't be a calm and reasonable person so we can see him face off against thor.
Ohhh por Dios!!! Voy a ahorrar hasta el último centavo para comprarme este juego!!!!!
Idk about you all but I'm loving that they give Thor that haunting grim reaper voice.
Is this tom Holland doing voice lines for Atreus?
Maybe Kratos's purpose will be to unite the Gods of War to make peace.
Wooowww
3 is top five games of all Time for me but not liked the new one . The greek mythology was way way better .
its!!! happening!!!
Already seeing what looks like more enemy variety, which is awesome. And the swell of the score when Tyr stood was 👌😩👌. Just make sure the storytelling/writing is on par with the previous entry and y'all have another absolute bangar on your hands. Looking forward to it!
Muito bom de mais eu quero jogar 🙂
Im so excited
Do we keep our upgrades from the previous game?
Can’t wait to play this for 12 hours straight.
REALMENTE  es un mal momento no tener una PS5, con todos esto grandes juegos que se mostraron hoy
It looks so real!
Loki be like i am the new santa man :@@@
Ps4 ?
lo ki sad we cant play as Atreus in this but I guess they're saving it for the next game
Where ps5 gang at
now we will help to atreus in his puberty... the best moment in the life... nice
I like the loki silhouette in the very beginning
I know atreus is older so of course he sounds older, but man it sounds weird lol
Just imagine When this game come to the pc How will its graphics be 🙄High resolution ultra wide moniter 144hz 120 fps and many more settings this gone be epic unfortunately PS5 doesn't have all this feature.😂poor ps5 user
SO. READY. FOR. THIS!!!!!
Hela: You can't defeat me. Thor: No, but he can. *Points at Kratos.*
This show was way overhyped
Thor just standing there.. menacingly! 😆😂
Please have boss battles.
Deus existe.
solo quiero decir algo tengo miedo .....
😱😱😱
Please release this year holidays
uow, this was amazing!
kratos vs thor
يا اله اي
Por favor podrían hacer que en una misión cestos se haga joven
Anyone else think Thor sounds a bit like Josh brolin?
Who does the voice of thor?
ΜΑ ΤΟ ΔΙΑ
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now I just need to get a PS5.
O melhor de todos!
ع الله حكاتيك يا ثور يا وحش الكون
in the beginning where atreus is walking with deer on is foreshadowing he's Loki side. Spikey Crown and menacing.
I am Waiting for it !!!!!!!
At the end, it says: "Coming to Playstation consoles", so maybe it will be on PS4 as well.
Atreus brought the deer this time.
No release date tho🥲
Santa Monica has done and made me squeal again
Thor = New GoW fans Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person."  Kratos = GoW Vets *having serious flashbacks* Kratos: "sure... why not."
Who's that girl?
I just jazzed
Coming to ps4?
💯💯💯👌
Excelente, ^^ : )))))))))
me body ready
Muito bom
Ahhh Kratos volviste por fin
its just me or  Kratos didnt say `Boy` `?
It s going to be in ps4 and 5 please tell me yes
I almost feel bad for Xbox people...almost
Tyr have life !!!!!!!!!!!
Y LOS SUBTITULOS MIERDDA!
Hyped
Ps4
Boi
BOIIIIII is back!
There are 2 gods of war!!!!
Give us the blade of Olympus!
Boy is man
Am I the only one exited that they kept mimir. I knew he grew on them.
Will be on PS4?
I hate to say it but if this is PS5 exclusive (exculding PS4 also) then it better be a game with the value of a $500 game because it would be the sole reason I buy any nex-gen console.
Shut up and take my money
🔥🔥🔥
I saw the trailer 3 times and all 3 times my hair stood on end 🥴
وينك ابو عطوان 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤪😜🤪😜🤪😜🤪🤪💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Meet you sister atreus
BOY Prepare yourself
2:52 Kratos vs Hercules reference?
I love the trailer! But don't you think it's a little bit too spoiler-y?
Klaiton e Mathew
YESSIR LET'S  GOO!!
Game of the year of 2022
Cadê a versão dublada com o Juarez??
cool
Gow😍
No puedo esperar para ver los gameplays de vegetta 😎👍
KRATOS, I LOVE U'
The chain of choas is back
Man when tyr just got up war meets war
Atreus: * Carries deer with antlers near his head *  Yeah, they know
"In moments of crisis, panic does nothing! Harness it. Let it serve you."
2022? or 2021?
Reason why I bought a ps5 to play this only ..
I can't f*cking wait :)
RETURN OF THE BOY!!!
who is Tyr?
Who was that tall guy?
As someone who’s been losing interest in games recently, this grabbed me and pulled me right back in.
Boi
Who loki 😂
I love this game! It'll be awesome! Freya is badass! LoL
Cant wait the GOW fans are ready for the next chapter LETS GO
I think Josh Brolin is Thor. I recognize Thanos voice anywhere.
3:04 State of Snoystation
Atreus: Start thinking like a general Kratos: “Flashes back to Olympus” Kratos: NO!  Also Freya sliced the shield, that alone shows the next level power we’re about to unleash.
Bruh, this is PS5 and it's dropping like crazy, 15fps tops. They should really consider putting this on PC (even after a year or so) to enjoy it's full potential.
Ok from what I can see from this reveal trailer they took everything that was great about the old game and made it even better! Alongside many new features like new bosses, characters, and worlds to explore! (And I hope for a co-op mode in the game)
You've seen "BOY", now get ready for "GIRL"
This is why playstation is better than Xbox.
I don’t even have a PS5 but I’m ready to see let’s plays of this game 🤩🤩  Plus I’m hyped for the fight with Freya and Thor, also more adventures with the now Teen Atreus
Ps4 graphic 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
RIP Thor
WAS THAT CALLIOPIE KRATOS DAUTHER OR WAS THAT
Atreus voice sound more grow up already
That was amazing
Интеересно🙂
I fear for the girl at the end
Hope the listen to the criticism from the previous game. Cause if they kept it basically the same, that'll be disappointing.  Like adding gyro aiming when throwing the axe as an option
And I can't even get my PS5 yet...
It’s fr the video game renaissance😭😭😭
Ohhhh it's Triple H!
Aí porra finalmente caralo
Operation Divert All Funds Towards a PS5 has commenced, so excited for this sequel!
Нихуя не понял но очень интересно
drawing me back in i want more queen valkyrie type bosses
will it still be one camers shot for the whole game 🤞🏼
im just glad ol Mimir is in the show~
In moments of crisis panic does nothing, harness it... let it serve you.
KRATOS
nobody talks about freya here🤣😂poor freya
rest in peace xbox
This isn’t coming out in 2022 is it?
The whole reason I bought the PS5….for $770…was to PLAY THIS GAME
🔥
this alone destroys everything that xbox will release all the gen
I CANT WAIT OMFG!!!!
*se viene*
حبايبنا في سوني وسانتا مونيكا مبدعين متأكد انو اللعبه ح تكون رهيبه واحلى من الاول كمان الاخبار الحلوه كلها بتجي في وقت واحد وظيفه جديده وقود اوف ور 5 جات شنو الحاجات الحلوه دي اتمنى بس تنزل علي كونسول 4
Looks like dlc
Como a crecido el pequeño NISTA<3
0:01  “Where are you coming from?”  “From the direction of deer.”
Use me as the RIP Xbox button 😄
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh letssss goooooo
Also I don’t like that Thor is fat
What a time to be alive.
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: X Doubt
Atreus: "stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general" Mimir: "you still didn't tell him?"  (By the way, who is the girl in the end?)
Да бл... и тут чёрных вкинули
Atreus: “stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general”  Kratos:“NO”  I think there some foreshadowing right there we may see the old Kratos 😱!!!!
Best game ever
Chupa caixistas.
W
🔥🔥💯💯
GOTY 2022!
1:58 that "NO!" That *boi*  boutta get Spartan Rage'd
Guess this is the last game for norse mythology
No necesito hhahahahahaha
Matheus' puberty voice 🤭
Ни минуты не сомневался что будет мегаохеренно!
They finally got rid of that annoying atreus voice  Replaced it with a leas annoying one
This, Spider-Man 2, Wolverine & Horizon: Forbidden West?  REALLY bad time not to be a Playstation owner...
the ps5 fanboys are salty that more people can play the game
I wish this game will come on ps4
Ok thank you for that. When you gunna release it...😐💔
Still don't have a PS5 yet, but I"M ON BOARD for this and Spiderman 2
Yes Please.
This needs to be out like right now, idk if I can wait any longer! 😂
Who that giant guy???
Can’t wait for UndertheMayo to complain about this game because it isn’t a 3D Side Scroller.
This is the biggest w i have ever seen
Algum brasileiro
I’m so hyped
We’re growing old with Kratos 🤧
La verdad espero que en este juego aya más armas
Atreus soon -> Loki🔥
After hearing all those stories about Thor in the last game. You best believe I wanna go toe to toe with him.
boy ar you ready
Wow
Look again at the trailer's beginning. Atreus's silhouette seemingly crowned with antlers/horns as he's hauling that deer carcass just REEKS of foreshadowing.
Alguém ta precisando de um rim? To vendendo o meu p compra esse jogo.
ALL hail greatness!
I have the feeling that Kratos will lose his inmortality curse in this game
We also want a ps4 version like gt 7
I'm sad, no for ps4
Epic
"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general!"  (Kratos' rage meter rising): "Boy....if I thought like a general, you wouldn't be here....💀" Atreus doesn't want ANY smoke from GENERAL Kratos!!
this is so Fkin AMAZING
is dlc?
I kind of wish they didn’t spoil Tyr but other than that I’m HYPED
Okay can we talk about the girl at last video, It could be Angrboða or Sigyn?
I wish we could get a pc port
I'm sad, no for ps4
Watching it boi..yeh!
I still don’t think Atreus knows what happened the last time Kratos acted like a general
Who's that Big guy at the end of the Trailer....!!🤔
Me volví loco con este trailer
But i have ps4 😭😭😭😭
Bro took you long enough
Amigo me reemocione 😍
mierda el Dios de la guerra es más grande
😱😱😱😱😱
AsheEEeEEe
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  John Cena: "Are you sure about that?"
little Boi has become a teenage Boi
I cant wait to watch other people play this on youtube
💚💚💚
Im waiting for adult Loki to be Voiced by Tom Hiddleston
Porque choras caixistas? kkkkk
TRAILER GOSTOSO
Why Kratos sounds like he had Covid-19?
😪 PS5s
The smile on my face when I saw kratos. I cannot wait for this masterpiece to come to playstation
All those dislikes must be from Xbox fanboys 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is it an exclusive for ps5?
beans
¿Por que Tyr tiene ambas manos? ¿Será que en este juego veremos como fenrir le arranca la mano?
Jogo foda quria jogar mais a PlayStation não me mandou o PS5 :(
LANÇA PRO PS4 PELO BEM DA HUMANIDADE DONA SONY
Ojalá Kratos no le arranqué las piernas a Tyr xD
Looks like Atreus went through puberty
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEU DEEEEUS DO CÉU!!!! TOMA MEU DINHEIRO PLAYSTATION
ESE ERA TYR!?? y estaban en otros reinos no? se veía muy colorido en algunas partes, eso si la fecha no esta, cuanto vamos a tener que esperar a este juegazo que se nos viene?? y Atreus uuy amigo se nota que maduro durante ese tiempo, no se ve tan frágil como antes empieza a tomar la forma de un dios o es solo mi idea?
Thor vs Kratos isnt going to be absolute fire
Seems that Astreus is looking for his glorious purpose.
Por que no hay un trailer épico como siempre
2:49 KBRON, KRATIS DERROTO ENEMIGOS MAS GRANDES
zendaya nooo
Bruh when he said NO to him I actually felt that.
Bro we got Spider-Man Wolverine and GOW Ragnorok they carried this state of play
I’ll only buy this game if Thor is playable
Yep, that’s enough for me. I’m playing it. :)
Overrated game 🤮
Sensacional
can't wait.               do i have to buy a ps5 for this game or will it work on the ps4?
jogo muito do pica
I'm laughing because Thor thought  Kratos is a calm and reasonable person
Only word would describe this game… “Indescribable.” Meaning I can’t wait to see how the game plays out!?
Finally a worthy game to buy a PS5.
Norse stuff is such a turn off for me. Can't wait for the next GoW.
Love that Mimir is writing his memoirs with a (spoon not pen) in his mouth   Also, THOR!!!!  (Edit -- check that, it's a spoon, and now I have questions)
que troles disque el nombre era diferente XD buena broma
MY BOY TYR!!!
don’t forget about ps4! player’s!
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?" (Thor, using a menacing tone) "Err..." (Kratos, who nicknamed the Blades of Chaos "Calm & Reason")
How is the unprasion man ?
Cleiton i Love you
This episode of Marvel "What-If" looks promising
I had a feeling Tyr is alive. Odin really is a shady man.
Ladies and gentlemen who is height for
Can't beat Goku tho
9/9/2021 بۆ یادگاری
PlayStation, blink if there’s a limited edition Ragnarok PS5 console coming…..
2:12 is that a bifrost?
How someone dislike a video like this?
Who else is ready to take Thor's hammer?
OOOOOOOO MMMMMMM GGGGGGGGGGG
My boy is back! And so is Kratos!
卧槽就完事了
O jogo vai ser só pro play5?
I love you Sony
freya has broken the curse!!
Bruh they left the diversity insert for the end of the trailer like we're supposed to be excited or something kekw
GAME OF THE YEAR OTW 🔥🔥👊👊
Ohhhh.....
ufff casi me vengo
Finally
1:46 QUE CARAJO KRATOS SE HIZO SPIDERMAN
Looks like a ps4 game.
Chora xbox
I cannot wait to play this game.
Just take my money now and get it over and done with already.
“Stop thinking like a Father and start thinking like a General”  ¿Have you learned something from the last game , BOIII?
The graphics are so underwhelming. It looks the same as the PS4.
Jogo é jogo e treino é treino! Tyr 10/10 em simpatia.🤣
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person" "Are you a calm and reasonable person?" Current Kratos yes, past Kratos, weeeeeellllll......
Who's that Giant??
Why only PS5, please do it on PS4 as well(((
🙏 🙏🙏🙏
1:44 The Chad walking from father and son
HOLY SMOKES THAT GRAPHICS🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Is kind of looks the same graphically
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩
Why is no one talking about the last bit? We now have not just the Boi but also the Gal lol
Trailer was great till Santa Monica stuidos  put a blk girl at the end. I smell political correctiveness, wokeness, being injected into this franchise. FFS, I hope i'm wrong.
Yeeesss no valkyrie yaaaas
ΤΗΝ ΕΧΩ ΒΓΑΛΕΙ ΕΞΩ ΚΑΙ ΤΗΝ ΚΟΠΑΝΑΩ ΣΤΟΝ ΝΙΠΤΗΡΑ
3:00 I love how the girl at the end is like, "Aww you wanted to know the release date? That's cute."
Es un  Reciclaje  del anterior
Bro! I can’t wait!
Best part of the trailer is mirmir’s still hanging with kratos.
I have a question will this game be on ps4
This looks identical to the last one. Graphics haven't improved a bit.
Waiting for the launch date…. You’ll get your answers soon enough. Fk me I love SSMS
PS4: Let's do this!  Me: Not today, old friend 😥
Va salir para ps4 tambien ?
Xuco dimanes 🇬🇶😭✨
🤯🤯🤯
Oh, hello Atreus’ mom!(??)
Que hueva me da sony y sus juegos.
Um lixo os melhores foi o 1 e2 aí fica fazendo essa bosta
I swear I’ll buy this game.
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?” *Press R1 to swing the Leviathan Axe*
Tankiu cleitinho por existir
finally atreus hunting the deer
I didn't see a Valkyrie....I think we're ok
It is look like a dlc.
Kratos: war is not the answer Atreus: stop thinking like a father and think like a general *Athen War flashback*
I am happy theres 3 new ps games coming soon
DIOOOOOOOOSSS KRATOS TE AMOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Esto es Arte...
2:29 Artemis?
Noting about ps4?
B O Y Y Y ! !
War. War never changes.
Are you kidding? Ship the PS5s worldwide, THEN make a showcase.
okay fine... take my money...faaaakk
“You must prepare yourself.”   Me: fine, I will get a ps5 before the game release. 😑
Thor: "Are you a calm, reasonable person?" Atreus: "Doth mother know, you weareth... her drapes?" Kratos: "Shut up, boy."
I wuz here before it hit 1 million views and 2 hours after release
I still hvnt played the last one. Anyone want to trade for a brand new series X for a ps5. Well, its used but its not. Its a fcking paper weight and has been. FCK YOU MICROSOFT.
PS4 and PS5?
Well done Playstation. In one hour you made me more excited about AAA gaming than entire Gamescom and E3 together, which without indie games would be empty affairs by now. Looking forward to 2022 with you!
Sensacional! 🇧🇷
Realese date?
t amo
OMGow
KRATOS YOUR BACK
Tir PLEASE don’t be evil! 😭😭

2:53 mogged

Ah mano acabei de platinar e vou postar no canal… e eles me soltam essa lindeza de trailer
Are you a calm and reasonable person 🔥🔥🔥
2021 showcase but the game is getting released this year as well?
BOI....I NEED THAT SHINNY LITTLE HAMMER OF THOR..GO HUNT FOR IT
That girl definitely has something to do with his mom and the giants
Atreus is all for war with aseir like loki was in old mythology. Maybe Loki's children are involved?
Hope Atreous still climbs on his dad's back 😂.  Also this game looks awesome hope you can fight Surtur lord of Mulsptheim
Em direto não gostei tanto do gráfico mas ao ver agora a 1080p já me parece bem melhor. :D Este vem cá para casa em steelbook!!
Yah .. 🥺🥺🥺😢 tears of joy .. yes 👏👏👏👏👏👏 ..
Eu vou comprar com toda certeza
Para ps4 también o ps5 nomas?
I felt that hard NO in my chest. 😖 YES KRATOS!

My feelings right now : AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
I hope Atreus is now par with Baldur in terms of raw power or 50% as powerful as Kratos
All these new game coming out yet the ps5 is so hard to get hour hands on. hope they make gow ragnarok into a ps4  too just like horizon west
😎
Nice they're appropriating our culture. Brown-washing nordic mythology.
Que fooooooodaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! Muito loko
😱😱😱😱
Game of the year for sure
I can't wait to watch youtubers  playing this game on youtube lol
This was one of the best Showcases Wolverine, Spiderman 2, PS5 update for Uncharted 4 and LL, GOW RAGNAROK!!!!!, 2022 is gonna be historical for gaming.

Апгрейд до версии пс5 за 10$
Anyone think that the dwarf with the squid is Cory Barlog???
Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Uhhhh...
Is this game only gonna be for PS5 or is it gonna be for PS4 as well
Where thor
Nobody's gonna talk about how the black girl at the end is probably Atreus' love interest.......   And probably Angrbodha or Sigyn?
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person." Greek pantheon “ you’re joking right”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we play as Atreus?
game looks sick its just in the back of my mind is that now we know Cory Barlog is NOT directing the game, will it stand up to the original? hmmm
Oh boy. Interessante demais!
Kratos:  "War is not the only way." Are you feeling okay, Kratos?  Blink twice if you are in distress.
Nice. Waiting for the eventual PC version. The better version.
Man hold up now I wanna buy. Ps5
😴😴😴
Ooooooweeee can't wait for all the people getting butthurt over a Black character existing in Midgard
2:44 who is he?
Yo maybe I'm tripping. But the girl at the end.... is that Calliope. Or maybe someone close to Kratos. There's no way she'd be there otherwise if you ask me.
امزح لعبه حلوى بس بزران سوني مطبلين
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person...  Kratos: That is where you are *wrong.*  *Flamming circle appears above Thor’s head*
2:44 LA CONCHA!!!! TYR!!!!!!!!!!
Who will buy this game on day one?
Boi🤣🤣🤣
I thought they said I would have it for PS4, unfortunately I can't jI thought they said I would have it for PS4, unfortunately I won't be able to play, but I love this game.

POR FIN, TE ADORO PLAYSTATION
Awesome.
Bueno, ahora solo ocupo una ps5
For those wondering, the girl at the end is Angrboda, who is Loki's wife and the mother of Fenrir, Jormunganr, and Hel in the mythology.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
😍💣👌🏼
Who is the black girl in the end? Is she Egyptian? Are they going to visit that mythology as well?
PlayStation fan since 1998 and I’m just always thrilled.

Just imagine how crispy the GoW PS5 is going to be though. I cannot wait.
For one second I thought that the girl at the end of the trailer was calliope, but then I realised she is black, F, maybe she is some refugee from Egypt?

Who’s that girl at the end?!!
Kratosssssssssssss
The dislikes are from the xbox fan boys
Kratos VS Thor. Place your bets!!!!
Stupid game
I think Sony (insomniac )should make a Thor game from the mcu as well
Thor: Are you a calm and reasonable person?  Mimir: This is the Ghost of Sparta you fat dobber  Kratos: head!  Thor: My mistake, have a nice day.
They definitely used sunny suljics face for this one
Siiiiii siiiiiioo SIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woman black....
the only thing that could top KOTOR, Wolverine AND spider-man 2
I can't wait when does it come out
YOOOOOO TYRRR
Is this only on ps5 😡😡
The Boy seems older you can tell.
Not gonna lie, I'm a little worried that Cory isn't directing anymore. :(
Thor's looking fat... All these theme park movies put the wrong impression in my mind.
já dizia o grande fumaça, you pick the wrong house fool thor
BOIII is different, dafuq
When its coming out
Me in 2019 : " Aww man.. it was just a dream ? Oh well. " Me in 2021 : " It appears I've been tricked, backstabbed and quite possibly, bamboozled. "
Jogo macho alfa
Thank you Santa Monica studios !! I love this!!
So it isn’t GOW2 but more like a expansion.
Release date?
i just Buy PS4 and The Game Came Out For Ps5 🙂
Welcome back, Kratos and 'Boy'
Why ppl are disliking the video???
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice!
This looks soooooo gorgeous fantastic work everyone!
Now is it just me or did anybody get disappointed when they saw GTA 5 remake.... These companies be bleeding us dry... Same game just updated... almost 7 years you can't come out with a GTA 6 on the PS5 sad man ... More disappointed tho
Will it be only available for PS5?
شديد ياعرب
Oh Boy.......here we go again!!!
Thor's fingers stung by a bee?
Pra quem não sabe , o gigante no final que fica em pé diante Kratos , é Tyr , o Deus da guerra Nordico ! Que juravam estar morto.Esse jogo vai ganhar o GOTY sem DUVIDAS!
Esperamos que saia no PS4 tbm! 👏👏👏
Man that fight with Freya already seemed epic,cant wait to see her going back to be friends with Kratos.
"and if that war leads to fisticuffs the the gods? Maybe that's what mother wants" So the idea of killing gods is alright with ya mate? Yer really are yer father's son
Dude I'm so freaking hyped!!!!
Copy paste from last one I hope this ragnarok is a better one
Graças a Deus a Sony não abandonou o ps4 que ainda tem muita lenha pra queimar uuufaaa rsrsrs
Will this only be ps5?
Boy hits puberty
I just jazzed my pants
Ahhh I'm soooo hypeeeddddd
Trailer Brabo dos Brabos Tmj sempre
Can't wait
I’m back!
Esta perdiendo la esencia original, pero aun así, se ve que va a ser una asombrosa entrega.
This is going to get ugly…🔥🔥🔥
Atraus has a crush.
Mama Mia..
*Tyr stands up* Kratos: "I thought you'd be bigger?"
LETS GOOOOOOO
I'm so excited 🇮🇶
BOY!!!
The 717 dislikes to this trailer are from Microsoft Employees 😂
o wow
"Hello Peter"
I hope I can get a ps5 when this game came out
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person? Kratos: Flashbacks of calmly ripping Helios’ head
Kratos!!!
What I’m guessing is thor is going to strike a deal with kratos to stay out of aesir affairs but in some way kratos and atreus will end up interfering causing the aesir to seek vengeance upon our main characters
TYR CARALHO
Prepare yourself Cartoonz
This makes me hyped and worried because i know there will be people spoiling it for the rest of us for no reason... Anyone got any tips for me?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Oh lalala mais s oh lala !
The only thing I'm worried about is combat it looks the same
وأخيراً رهيب
Amazing!!!
Something to look forward to yes
"start thinking like a general" i have a feeling this will age horribly
THE WAIT IS OVER
looks awesome I can't wait
Where's the preorder button?
Viva Peron carajo!
Yes, just what this game needed. Comic book crossovers 😒
El encuentro de 2 dioses de la guerra !!!! Y con un mismo fin y propósito, prevenir la gran guerra.

Excelente
Los años no pasan en vano...
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Recién hace una semana me compré y me pase la entrega de 2018
GOTY.
YESSSSSS
WOW🔥
Wow beautiful ❤
Pretty sure that's Ryan Hurst as Thor. Super excited to play this!
Amazing
Por si buscas un comentario en español aquí lo encontraste crack, logro desbloqueado :v
عظمة
Of course they needed to add the female POC somewhere to look "inclusive" sony is now just lefty propaganda after moving to commiefornia.
Game Of The Year again?❄🔝
Nobody :  Me:  Kratos Klaus ....and Loki the elf
What a mann
BLADES OF CHAOS LETS GO!!!!
I honestly can't wait for this game although I'm surprised to see there's no graphical leap from the ps4 one. Also the fact Cory has no involvement in the project :(
Voy a demandarlos por venta de drogas, maldita sea... LO NECESITO!
I am calm and ready to preorder
I came
GOTY 2022. 🤫
I gotta stay Alive till next year!
"Are you a calm and reasonable person?…”       Ask your sons.
Who’s the girl in the end? And who voice acted Thor?
I'm calling it now, the girl at the end is ODIN
1:44 "What if the only way to do that is war" Watch your Words Atreus, war brings nothing but loss and misery.
Amazing!! Can't wait for its release. Look at Tyr, he has both hands... Meand that Fenrir will appear rip one of them off???!!
BOY!!!!
Trailer should’ve ended at 3:00 .
READ IT BOY
Who else started beating their meet when they saw this showcase?
Yo tyr looks badass
It’s over!!!!!
That girl in the end must be Egyptian...looks like it somewhat.
More boss variety, please
Even though Atreus has turned into a full grown teen, in our eyes, he will remain our little "BOY".
Ohhhh
NOS AMAMOS KRATOS
KRATOOOOOOS ERES MI PELON PREFERIDOOO
Let me guess, he's falling from the cliff or something and loses his armor and shield somehow, or someone stoles it
I have a Kroner
el momento mas esperado de toda latinoamerica  xd
“Think like a general”   That costed kratos family
And so the journey continues
LETSS GOOOOO
I don't like Atreus's mature voice it doesn't fit for me but who knows it might grow in me to like it
We’ll time to sell my soul for a ps5
Tiene los mismos gráficos que el primer juego ;v
2:30 Dúvida de um leigo: Centauros não são personagens da mitologia grega ?
Sheeeeeeees
I love gow, but this is more of the same. Lets see
YES YES YES YES !!!!
I wish they showed spider man 2 after this, I was a little distracted 😂, but still it looks amazing
Dang it I don’t want to kill a centaur
Thor: “You Seem Like A Calm And Reasonable Person” Kratos: (Flash Back Of Killing Zeus)
Uouu... contagem regressiva... prepare-se!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I really wanna see Odin from this game.
no entendí nada de lo que dijeron porque no hablo ingles pero igual me emocione mucho xd
So I won't be playing this, because I don't see my self getting a ps5 soon enough.
It's no Bloodborne 60 FPS but I'll take it.
Esse jogo vai ser maravilhoso
Achei muito parecido com o primeiro
Thor: Traiganmee a Kratos!
quase eu choro que jogão da porra...sidao vai pirrar hj kkkkk
I loved this entire trailer, seriously, but are we not gonna talk about the little cutie at the end? Possible love interest for Atreus? Hmmmmm? 😳
Can’t wait to hear “BOY” 3000 more times! So nostalgic
GAME OF THE YEAR ALREADY
Is it releasing for ps4 too?
Zera que veremos odim ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH MI CORAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
dude I am so ready when this comes out
did kratos knew tier?????
Отвал башки
looks like fryea is going to be seeing zeus soon
Hype train is here!!
Tyr Is very similar to Kratos... Umm maybe it's Kratos from the future or something?!
If Kratos don't say "Boi" 100 times in Ragnarok I'am OUT!!!
LETS GOOOOO
this seems so much more fleshed out and has MUCH more to it. looking forward to seeing others play it
Personally I think they should give Atreus a little bit more hair but this looks dope
Anybody else pick up that Mimir is also Celebrimbor from Shadow of War
Game of the Year already
Tyr’s alive!!
I miss Greek gows
PlayStation 5 is trash Xbox is better
Calvooo
🔥
🙏🏻
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why I can’t stop watching it, even I haven’t a PlayStation 😂😂
todo lindo menos la inclusion final
Tyr has both hands?

“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos: “uhhhhhhhhh pass.”

Bruh
Freya looks like a depressed chloe
So mad I missed the live showcase
Can I order it now. I can’t wait
My favorite game of all time is back again 😍 I platinum Gow 2018 gotta do the same with this.
Looks like the same graphics as PS4.
It’s all cool and all, but didn’t leave the same impact as the previous one’s reveal gameplay trailer at e3.
Kratos vuelve ala acción baby!!!
Should have PS5 Slimish by then.
This is why XBOX can't compete with Playstation😁👍
I had to get the tissues
LOVE LOVE LOVE
I'm shaking.
Mais um filme interativo kkk
This Is The Best Franchise In Gaming History 🔥❤️

Can't wait to play this game as a pacifist...
Looks great
I LOVE YOU FUK9ING KRATOS YOUR THE BEST
Wow look the Atreus, he is more "giant"

Eh boring yawn fest
my birthday is tomorrow, if you want to give me a ps5 I would love, I'm from Brazil and here is very expensive.
Yes!
Ojalá se pueda exportar el escudo espartano al nuevo juego.
Thor and the Avengers: We've got a Hulk Loki: We've got Tyr
Is this for PS4 as well?
my birthday is tomorrow, if you want to give me a ps5 I would love, I'm from Brazil and here is very expensive.
Oh no....kratos will fight freya and thor...stakes are higher this time...plus tyr is still alive after all these years ??
my birthday is tomorrow, if you want to give me a ps5 I would love, I'm from Brazil and here is very expensive.

Ps4??
my birthday is tomorrow, if you want to give me a ps5 I would love, I'm from Brazil and here is very expensive.
Someone please tell me who’s that voicing Thor cuz the voice is so familiar yet I can’t seem to put my finger on it.
Wait the game is not in ps4???
my birthday is tomorrow, if you want to give me a ps5 I would love, I'm from Brazil and here is very expensive.

ps5 only? smh they’re still hard to find so much for this game
Se ve brutal
Aaaaaaa
Calling this as Game of The Year already.
Selamat anda menemukan komentar bahasa indonesia
🤩🤩🤩
hoped they would change the fov 🤧
Isn't Tyr supposed to have lost a hand to Fenrir?
BOY!!!
This game soundtrack requires a song from the bands Tyr, Heilung and Amon Amarth.
Who's the big guy at the end
Call me crazy but I feel like Thor isn't a  Villain in this. Feel like you will fight him but for some reason I don't think he is a true Villain.
🇧🇷❤️
Xbox wins
Epic.
I hate Atreus's new design. Why is he ugly for some reason
I’m sure to Thor Kratos is quite calm and reasonable haha
I came
Can't wait to play on my ps4 pro
Is this the last GoW game?
Os unicos que podem acabar com a pandemia
That octopus guy for me is odin in disguise..
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Looks like DLC
EU FIQUEI SEM PALAVRAS, CARA... ISSO TÁ M A R A V I L H O S O !!!!!, MDSSSSS, Mal posso esperar.
When Tyr stood up over Kratos.. you know this dude is going to be a BEAST
Estara en ps4?
TE AMO KRATOS, FE AMOR, TRM ANO, LEJD AMO
Pare de agir como um pai e comece a agir como um general!  Caramba eu mal posso esperar pra ver alguém jogando isso no youtube.
Vai sair pro ps4??
Boy is now a slightly older boy😭💀
I knew Tyr was alive
1:05 Look at Mimir, painting using his mouth 😂
Aterus: war is coming   *cyber punk 77 theme song intensifies*
PERFEITO ESSA DESGRAAAAAÇA !
Segura o novo GOTY da Sony Microsoft
Vamos começar o jogo poderosos e depois de uns 30 minutos de jogo perder tudo kkkkkk
This makes me excited!!
It looks like Kratos will be calling "YOUNG MAN!" Instead of BOI!
Sad no Xbox player can enjoy this masterpiece🤣
Tyr and kratos: finally a worthy opponent! Our battle shall be legendary! (I don’t know if this will happen but it would be cool)
I was hoping for jumping mechanics...
It would be great to use Thor's hammer with haptic feedback 🔥
The greatest game series of all time
is the big guy at the end supposed to be eitri, the dwarf who makes weapons?
Xbox is garbage
Thor: you seem like a calm and reasonable person... Zeus be like: yo if he's calm then i'm hello kitty......
Beatiful
OMFGGGGGG
I hope they're change voice of Atreus
QUE DELÍCIA CARA
BROOOO😱😱😱
WHY JUST IN PS5 WE NEED IT ALSO IN PS4
Acho que Atreus vai matar Kratos
pureyu staishonu
I simp for murderous angry Freya
Melhor jogo ✅✅✅
Vai da pra jogar com o Atreus,acho que pelo menos em um momento do jogo vai poder
Ohhhhh I can’t waaaait to play this
Yea I need to be alone for a bit
People have been asking for it. Kratos: Then you shall receive it.
I'm the biggest fan of the game, but unfortunately I miss the brutal and strong side of Kratos. The old parts were one of the best parts, they are legendary, but the last two parts unfortunately disappointed me, but I will keep playing all the parts until the last day of my life
Kratos hazme 10 hijos 😀
Un mensaje en español XD Buenos días tarde y noches solo comento que se nota que este será un juegazo quien diría que cada secuela de este juego fuese tan buena xd
Kids getting hyped for some copy and paste COD and Battlefield... Real men are hyped for this....
❤️❤️🥰🥰
I am going to platinum tf out this game
Atreus: “stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general” Kratos: “Boy.. you are treading on some mighty thin ice here”
Ragnarok will come upon us
kratos pra sempre
Boooooy i miss this 😻
To the new director I say this: "Do not undo his work, improve upon it only."
Thor got some serious sausage fingers, to much mead, meat and uh... ladies
Weird hearing Teal'c mentioning Asgard and not talking about little grey aliens.
Tyr!!!!!! Still alive!
One time for Josh Brolin’s voice acting!!!
IM NOT READY
YA ESTOY ARANDO PARA COM PRAMELO Cuando salga
Esse jogo vai ser insano.
I'm seein a GOTY in the making
DEUS É BOM
:')
I want TC Carson cameo real bad
Oh my gods!!!!!! I need to get a ps5 before it comes out!
They finally made a DLC
This is for the players!!
Vai custar meu rim 😶
My BOOOOI !
Eu esperei 3 anos por esse trailer e se for necessário eu espero 10 anos pra lançar, contanto que seja bom
Finally blood again 🤩
THOR
Come for ps4?
BOY
Is this one open world free-roam?
i wish i could care about GoW but i just cant...
Vazou a namorada do atreus
Bomb! 💪🏼
I knew it im so happy I have a PS5 for this game so Lucky
Bearded Kratos returns.
Tir averaged 55 rebounds in the nba
My haha to Xbox players
Juegos que voy a mirar y nunca jugar porque vivo en LatinoAmérica
Absolutely amazing 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"We need more enemy variety"  Motherfuc***rs they heard all of you
TAKE MY MONEY SONY
ohhhh me vengo
Una mierda, los escenarios los llenaron de neblina porque la potencia de la ps5 no da para más!!
Al fiiiiin!!!!!!
AI MEU CORAÇÃO
Anyone notice them hinting at Loki's "horns" during Atreus' silhouette entrance? Cool Easter Egg hinting at the near future.
I'ma take that hammer.
كريفوس
I love how his son is such a badass.
GOOOSEBUUUUUUUUMPS OH MA GAAAWD 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Aaaaaaa
I wonder if that's supposed to be Cleopatra
<3
Wow actual gameplay! If only the rest of the conference was like this ......
Saldrá en PS4 también no ?
Tyr is gonna betray us in the end. And GoW4.3 is gonna be GoW vs GoW!!
2:55 the last time someone looked at kratos like that it didnt end well
Hype train begin
Diooooooos es bellísimo te amo kratos!! *llora de emoción*
I’m so ready
Kratos!!!
Who was the girl at the end????? Will that be Atreus's girlfriend?????
okay time to finally get that ps5
Why did they spoil so much?!
HYPE💫
Kratos is far different than the GOW3 kratos. Composed, logical, overall mature. GOW3 was a ruthless beast who was merciless
Amazing… until the end? Diversity in my Viking history?! Why?
quando foi postado esta obra d arte?
Really hope they go back to the roots and make it brutal again more BLOOD AND GORE
20121 acaba bien✨
The BOI is growing
finally
2:25 centaur?
kratos is the most calm and most reasonable person ive ever seen
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Me: My wallet: NO ! PLEASE NO!
Can we finally have a jump button
Same game...  Ps5 remaster station. Out of disk space edition. No new exclusives. Also its out of stock. Ran out of ideas edition. Looks like a room heater, oversized router.
*DAD OF BOI: RAGNAROK*
Rip 🪦 Xbox
B O Y
I'M READY. The games I want the most are Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Black Myth: Wukong and the next Elder Scrolls
Bad Ending: Cuesta 200 dolares y no hay ofertas
So Barlog isn't directing and there won't be a third game in the Norse saga? I have some reservations
Epico
Thor definitely didn't play the old games
This is why XBOX will never surpass PlayStation as the better console because of this masterpiece of a game
Atreus vai comer essa mina certeza
Vrg vrg vrg 😱😱❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tyr with kratos you must get ready
...And This is the same kratos that ll come in fortnite
Thor: "Are you sure this is noobmaster69?"
LETS FUCKEN GOOOOOO
BOAH!
Tyr nos ayudara a viajar a Asgard y los otros reinos bloqueados 😎🔥🔥
Who is the voice actor during Thors scene?
TRASHH
Na primeira cena Pensei que o atreus tava grande ksksks
Súper GENIAL….!!!!!!!
ANOTHER BLM GAME?
This is gonna be the game of the year. You know I’m right !
Tyr kinda looks like troy baker with long beard.
Mali ratnik posto Bez veze iste fore
Te amo Kratos , lpm esper mucho esto
the shot of tyr standing up is f'ing awesome
Vai ser so pra ps5?
Vai ter pra ps4?
MANO QUE PERFEITO, MUITO ANSIEDADE PRA LANÇAR LOGO
Te quiero ostias
Yo how tall is he kratos is 7ft he must be 9ft
Take my money
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
Tyr : Stands above Kratos  Kratos: I thought you’d be bigger
keep your expectations high on this one boi and you'll not be disappointed
1:35  1:54 .
Simplemente el mejor juego
I never think that tyr was alive
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Mind your tongue, boy! Until our journey is complete, one of us must remain focused!”- Kratos.
What is Atreus’ nexus point that causes the TVA to arrest him and send him to the end of the universe with President Loki and Loki-gator?
AEE Finalmente
🔥🔥🔥
1:36 everyone hearing Atreus’ new voice
CAN'T FREAKING WAIT!
I wonder if that girl in the end was supposed to be angrboda
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Atreus : stop thinking like a father, start thinking like a general    Kretos : press L2 to choose the hammer
Porfavor una película de esta bella obra de arte, postulo a Rory McCann como kratos
👍
I'm really excited!!!
Is this a dlc that took 4 years to come to the light? Nice let’s play it on ps4, no need for ps5 right now
Who’s the girl at the end?
BOI
Kratos versus Battletoads
Hoping for a smooth 60fps mode...
Es tyr! Pero que ha pasaoooo!?
Atreus: stop thinking like a father and start think like a general   Men: Oh you don’t wanna go there
Love this! Can't wait for the release!
Hopefully it is more open world with less linear rails. Last one was so boring and repetitive.
Can’t wait 🥲🥺😿😢
*RIP XBOX*
629 dislikes dont have a Playstation
I expected it is not so
Shouldn’t Freya have her wings ?  I mean the transformation into a Pigeon is great and all but If she had her wings I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t get yeeted off the shield as easily as that
What a beautiful game!!! I'm hyped
Graphics looks dated ...just high res but seem low quality textures. ..
idk if I like Atreus' voice yet but very much looking forward to this release!!!! 4/20/22? another 420 release would be awesome.
GOTY again!
Lets goooooooo!!! Anybody else nutted? 💦
The last women intrigue me , is it possible that she from asian mythology would be fire its will mean that other mythology will comes too
Solo tengo una cosa que decir antes los comentarios en ingles:       Ñ
Why is Zendaya everywhere?
Looks a generation ahead of anything on Xbox
1:55 I like how they cut after the calm. Noooooooo!
Foda demais, mas vcs tem que concordar, a dublagem br fica muito melhor
Solo tengo una cosa que decir antes los comentarios en ingles: Ñ
*Los bendice en maya *
At 2:34 you can see Atreus riding a Deer and Kratos with new shield
Wow thats the guy from fortnite 🤡
Boy is going through rebellious stage
Eu estive aqui, volto em 2026
Déçu...
Esta parte de mi vida. Esta pequeña parte, se llama: Felicidad
Bruh
Since when i can translate the comments ?!
Other GOTY 🙏❤
KRATOS BOM DE GUERRA
I remember when ps1 cut scenes were so high tech..how times have changed
Epicardo
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person” Poseidon: 😬
So .. this BOY will be even more annoying :))
BOY!!!
Ok take my money
It seem like a DLC for GOW4..
It's time Bois. It's time......
Why use Norse Mythology if you are just going to insert blacks and turn it African?
That mocap though, absolutely brilliant
I don't even have a playstation and I'm hyped for this game.
STOP BUYING WESTERN GAMES. BUY JAPANESE ONLY.
YES!!! BOI
Kratos: Are you coming with us?   Tyr stands up...  Kratos to Atreus-I thought he'd be bigger.
"You seem like a calm and reasonable person".  A giant circle suddenly starts spinning over Thor's head.
GOTY ja ta garantido
Yes yes yes
cant wait
Did i miss the part where GoW was purchased by Disney ?
now i just need a ps5
O homem está de volta, esse é nosso momento, guys.
Boa Garai
random black girl is random
This trailer is everything.
Sony coming in clutch bringing out the colossal heavy hitters  Insomniac Games at this rate will become flagship studio
I really really hope that we end Thor with the Blades of Caos, so they feel the true power of Kratos.
Of course at the end, they reveal it for the Woke garbage it'll be. Join us on the upcoming FNT to watch your parents and grandparents bxtch and moan about the Wokeness all over this.
🔥🔥🔥
- Para de pensar como um pai e começa a pensar como um general! - Você é burro ou quer um real, Atreus? - Eu quero um real. - Então você é burro, porque eu matei o Real.
Has two hands, can’t be Tyr
Game of the year. Hands down. And what music. 😭 I am crying
This is...Godly 🔥🔥🔥
Who is the old guy he saved at the end of the video. Is he zeus 😳 father of kratos
“Boyyyyy” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🎮
is coming to ps4 to?
PQP ! PQP ! PQP !
solo va a salir para PS5 no para PS4
Looks like a ps4 game... :/
BOY!!
I am so fired up for this, highlight of the showcase for me, and that's pretty dang impressive considering there were Spider-Man and KOTOR announcements.
Doido para ver o Thor encarando o Kratos cara a cara!
Kratos está de volta!!!
Atreus: I am burden with glorious purpose.  Kratos: What? Atreus: What?
I honestly could’ve waited patiently with greys and I still would have been satisfied
mesmo grafico
TÝR is Coming..
Epico !!!
Only some of you can understand how happy I am right now.
Ragnarok : the DLC we never got
Dat Boi is GROWN
>Black people in norse mythology
We get it, Sony, you're not racist
THIS. IS. GOING. TO. BE. EPIC. Now, to find a PS5...

I couldn’t believe myself I got my hands on PS5, now I can’t wait to get my hand on GOW ragnarok
Will Will will😶😶😶
I cannot explain the amount of adrenaline I just got from watching this.
So.... Freya doesn't look like she's calmed down all that much...
So when can I pre order this?
Dios es hermoso.... Que emoción ya quería saber algo y valió la pena esperar sabia de que thyr seguía vivo
yeah pretty cool but why black people?
Meanwhile loki is struggling time multiverse at TVA
Cory and crew take my money!!!

Thor is about to find out what ghost of Sparta wraith feels like
🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
At 2.25 is that a Centuar? A Greek monster
Espero que venha para o ps4 pfvr Sony 🙏🙏

I wonder what's the reason for Kratos weapons to be drained all over again.
TIME TO FINALLY BUY PS5 BOYS!!
I just want it for ps4 though please tell me it's coming to pa4
When does this game come out
E os caixistas passam mal…
2:25 that centaur is definitely Artemis

When is the game coming out? "When it's ready"
Everything here is all I hoped for Ragnarok and more, and I know we have only began to grasp the surface!! This will be unreeeaaal!! And we have yet to see Odin, Fenrir and Surtr at least!
FREYA 😍😍😍
Meu deus do céu eu vou morrer aqui
So sad I won't be able to play this one
“Somebody just called the serpent”
The silhouette of Atreus carrying the deer... that's some next level foreshadowing
🔥Ragnarok is coming
Kratos turns Thors hammer into a blunt ended suppository.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
tanto tiempo para que siga siendo pequeño y estorboso
Kratossssss!
please don’t make it ps exclusive this time
Can’t wait to play this on ps4.
Oh no another parent child relation game
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general! Kratos: You are not that boy son trust me, you are not that boy.
GOTY Smell. Cheirinho de GOTY.
Enquanto isso os caixistas se contentam com seus simuladores de triple A e seus milhares de jogos velhos "grátis" no gamepass por mais uma geração hahahaha
Anyone else think that "you'll get ur answers soon enough" statement was timed that way to be a response to all of us asking ok so when does this come out?
Vc tinha minha curiosidade em comprar um Playstation... agora tem minha atenção 😁
the Wonder game
This game will be a graphical marvel on the  ps5 🥶 i can't wait
On ps4 too?
Everyone’s theory that Kratos is Tyr just got thrown out the window.
Atreus or should I say Loki's magic looks like its improved and his voice is so deep haha  Also: Tyr and Kratos  Two Gods of War teaming up yassir
You get your answer soon enough...well some of them. **while creating more questions**
my reasanable person goes thro the roof when it comes to reassnable
Thor?
Myself to my wallet: “you must prepare yourself”
I wonder if they really did get Chris Hemsworth to voice Thor, I mean think about it, they had Kevin Sorbo to voice Hercules in GOW 3
Other game that i cannot play and i have to see troght  gampleys..... I LOVE IT!  *CRIES IN LATIN's POOR*
Eu tô aqui todo cagado
nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu que jogo gostoso
“You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  *L3+R3 go brrrr*
Prepararé la billetera
Like para ps4
TAKA TAKA 🤣
*Only Kratos and Atreus could close out that jam-packed State of Play*
decime que va estar para la ps4 porque si no me corto la pija  entera
EU TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO KRATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS !!!!!!!!
Get rid of Kratos pants. He's a Spartan for Pete sake.
BOY!!!
Que momento para estar vivo muchachos
guatafac
F*ck Sony. Randomly putting a black kid in Norse Mythology is downright disrespectful. All for the sake of being woke. You ruined GOW!!! Great job. There is 0 improvement in the gameplay.
Jogo bonito, jogo bem feito!
The Girls is Calíope?
Best thing to come out of the event
Que epicoooooooooo la concha de la lora!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aight time to try and get my hands on a ps5 before this comes out
اكو عرب بالطياره
This game could play on ps4
Just Incredible
Thor ile krotos anlaşma yapacaklar thor onlara dokunmayacak 2. Oyun en sondaki kızı kurtarmak ile geçecek diye düşünüyorum o kız ile artreus aşık olacaklar kız ölecek ya da kaçırılacak artreus ta kızı kurtarmak için thor ile olan anlaşmayı bozacak
That girl at the end looked stupid.
Kratos didn’t even say BOY for one time :(
I'M SO HAPPY
Funny Tyr actually thinks he’s intimidating Kratos! Like he’s never fought anything bigger than him before… bwahahahaha!
BOY!!
Yes
This looks so incredible! <3
At this point it's not even competition
WE EAT
All the jeez
No me gusta el diseño del hijo de kratos.. antes era pequeño y simpatisaba pero ahora es joven y necesita más estilo propio
"Are you a calm and reasonable person" Josh Brolin is that you?
It been 5 minutes
and for pc? :c
Same graphics
dumbed down for the ps4.
very normal
At this point it’s gonna be hard to decide which is “GOTY” there’s too many 😅
This is the best game of the century, ever!!!🔥🔥🔥🍃🍃
This looks amazing 🔥
Vsfd q foda
Asgard está linda, e já mostraram que Týr está vivo no trailer, caramba  vai ser maneiro esse encontro dos Deuses da guerra, kratos vai aprender muito com esse cara
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please give Atereus's voice a voice tweak. Maybe an accent? Voice seems SUPER out of place compared to everyone elses.
1:55 EXCUSE ME?????
Bruh this is everything I look forward to I know this isn’t revealing anything deeply later in the game but I hope we at least get to see Vidar Vali and Odin..  This game is gonna be SICK!!!
And now the hunt begins for the PS5
Thor : "You seem like a calm and reasonable person" Vietnam war music starts playing
Atreus is still a annoying little brat :)
foda ba garai
Yesss
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
* se viene *
Ohh baby Winter's coming 🥶 Kratos ufff can't wait 🙌🐐
We have waited...and ill wait more if i need to...
Pls, be in PS4 🙏🙏🙏
Espero vivir hasta cuando salga.
What is the release date?
Is finally here  but theres something off Am i the only one?
Name the YouTubers your gonna watch them play this
“The time draws near… you must prepare yourself.  but keep your expectations low, and you’ll *never* be disappointed.”
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💢
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am hyped
I would buy a PS5 only for this game.
Is it just me or does something feel off? Like too feminine or something?
This is so epic bro this is fantastic!!!
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees finaly
Why does Atreus looks like teen Jaden Smith or I’m the only person realizing that😂?
GODO GUAR PAPAAAA
My body is ready for me to play this game
Thor:you seem like an calm and reasonable person.  Kratos:omae wa mou shindeiru!
2:50 *Mi fé en Cristo me hizo mejor dios de la guerra Kratos.* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Big reveal for the giant…Is like two feet taller than kratos
Game of the Decade right here 🐐
Ending: the last hit of thors hp Cinematic and then boom TO BE CONTINUED HAHAHA
Mal posso esperar por 2050 pra eu poder comprar um PS5 e jogar.
Oh, that "NO" was instant when Atreus said "start thinking like a general" cause Kratos knows all too well how that'll end, absolutely love it
I still remember the hype I got in 2018, it took me a while to accept all the changes, but I soon recognized how great this game was!    And this one seems to really give continuity to the entire universe, this renewed franchise, David Jaffe must feel a huge pride of his creation is like this today !!!
KRATOS IT’S COMING🤩🤩🤩
Ragnarok is coming
"War is not the only WAY"'
ARE you ready BOOOOOYS
I want to know the Release date
But where pour is Odin ?
LETS GO RON PEARLMAN AS THOR!
Fire whoever made this trailer, they made the game look so average. I was expecting an epic trailer
Meh ... That's all I have to say
Literally looks like an expansion pack lol
Take my money
Anyone knows which ost plays the moment Atreus appears with the deer on his back? Its like the main theme but slower. (It also played when Kratos was taking the heart in Helheim)
Ragnarok is Coming we must prepare ourselves and Kratos fighting Thor going to be brutal I can't wait!
The Tyr !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7/10 trailer
colocando em 4k fica coisa de maluco
is anyone else hoping that the little girl at the end is Calliope?!
Que momentazo para vivir en Latinoamérica y apenas tener para comer😭👌👌
Yes black people in viking game
I cannot wait for 2050 when I'll be able to buy a PS5 😞😞😞
So let me guess either Thor or Tir is the final boss!!
NO WORDS SANTA MONICA🤩🤩
aaaaaaaaa sonyyyyy I don't have the heart for it
WHERE IS THE LAUNCH DATE???? 2022 SUMMER....???
Thr twilight of the Norse Gods Ragnarok!!!!
é normal ficar com pau duro assistindo um trailer ?
TAPORRA MENÓ
Gonna play another playthrough of GoW again...
It's kinda crazy how Atreus is all for going to war against the Aesir. More like Kratos than I'm assume Kratos is comfortable with given how much effort he went to hide away
He sounds like Steven universe
Kratos: *Start thinking like a general and stop thinking like a father Loki: I shouldn't have said that... I should not have said that...
And this is coming to PS4 i'm so excited!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ps4 ?
Kaptain Kuba is gonna have a field day with this lol
That symbolism with Atreus walking in from the cold with the deer on his back. The antlers makes him already look like Loki.
Can't wait for this!!!!
DC vs Marvel
you can see atreus is riding on a deer 2:35
why does tyr have his both arms?
Ragnarok is coming!!!!
Kinda sad the the axe got reset as well as the blades
La cago el final
Is Josh Brolin voicing Thor?
Atreus sounds terrible
Im hyped for this and spiderman 2
TYR TÁ VIVO ? Ca-ra-leo!
2022? 2023?
Villages? WITH NPCS? GIMME!
Sh17 just got real
2:48....how is it?
Nice.
💙💙💙💙💙
Thor: are you a calm and reasonable person? no, no, and no.
1:55 - *B O I!* Do not take that tone of voice with me!
Tava óbvio que a bruxa iria voltar.
We will definitely have a new shield.....
such a shame, not a single Boy mention.
Sin palabras
Al fin aparece Tyr el dios de la guerra nórdico junto a Kratos
Será que o cara gigante do final é maior do que o Hércules? 🤔
It's Kratos,from Fortnite!!!!!!!!!!
太好了，终于看到你了！
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
soy el unico que se le paro el pito con este trailer? espero que salga lo mas antes posible
I have money Sony yet you won't allow me the ability to buy a PS5
The real reason I bought the Ps5!
Is the PS4 not supported or what
maybe the centaurs is like the replacement of the valkyries imagine fighting them and ripping of there legs
2:23 is that a centuar i see?
KRATOS O CARECA QUE MAIS AMO !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <3
Vai sair pra PS4 ???
*BOY* is not *BOY* anymore his *TEEN*
SO FREAKEN EXCITED FOR THIS
only on ps5?
I cannot wait to neglect my son and play this
😱😱😱😱
I always watch these reveals on co-stream (streams of a stream). It's great to see other's reactions specially when you are watching these alone, but watching the 4k video hits a little differently.
MY BOY ATREUS GON GET SOME🤣🤣🤣
Ending ruined it. Why is there a black woman in Norse mythology
Bruuuuh
No te mueras kratos, te queremos mucho
Nooooo.... Why didn't they let that kid grow a couple years older and be like Bjorn Ironside, and let the game be called it "Gods of War"
Wow 🔥🔥
the girl at the end looks out of place
I am ready, right here right now!
Oh me vengo!
I hope more bosses
The details 😍😍😍
Why do they end on a random black girl?
KRATOS it's back!!!!!!!!!!
Зачем тут чёрная девочка азиатка? Толерантность в мире скандинавских богов?
Take my pesos
token black kid
Only ps5 F F
Надеюсь там реально будет 40 часов сюжета!!!
me vengo!!!!!!!11
That Loki easter egg at the beginning hat me grinning like a maniac :D
Блять, они и сюда сникерсов запихнули🤦‍♂️
Le doy like antes de verlo, porque se que en el año que salga, será el goty
“Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general” Kratos: *Proceeds to rip Atreus head off*
MEU CARECA PREFERIDO VOLTO CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Who’s the guy in 2:53
Can’t wait for this legendary game.
Release date?
So I'm guessing Fenrir hasn't bitten off Tyr's hand yet can't wait to see how loki and Fenrir are connected
Was the unknown voice for jash brolin?
En menos de 3 oh 4 horas ya tendrá 2.6M vistas
Everything looks so amazing but one question who is the girl at the ending on the trailer and RELEASTE DATE PLEASE ASAP?
yesss!!! so ready! my son is gunna be so excited! cant wait!
Looks like Boy is becoming man
O último q apareceu era Baldur?
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
2:04 Get Over Here
The game is the best🎮👍
Ps4?
All these games coming out and you can't get a PS5! Do better, Sony!
TYR’S ALIVE😨
In PS4 ?
Ofc they had to ruin it by putting a black woman at the end on a Nordic setting...
Freya indo matar kleitao kkkkkkkkkk
CALLIOPE??????😳😬
War never changes....
warm
Kratos and Atreus are being carried by two wolves in 0:42, one is white and the other one is black. Foreshadowing for Sköll and Hati! Genius!
Thor, Angrboda, and Tyr. Yassss!!!!
I'm waiting the Gow Ragnarok
YESSSS!!!! Can't wait for this!
I need see plz thor and odin and tyr plz
Thor: "You seem like a calm and reasonable person."  Chris Hemsworth: "Is he though?"
i anazyle this trailer einjair warriors of valhalla i think in this trailer odin sending them after kratos and atreus.
LETS FKN GOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
reminder: this game could be looking even better if it wouldnt also be developed for the ps4
Holiiio
Boy
I swear there is just 500 people in the world who wait for any kind of video to be released just to dislike it. And anyone else notice the 3rd dwarf, I wonder if he's on of the brother's Ivaldi.
ESSE É O JOGO DA MINHA VIDA, SIMPLESMENTE O MELHOR! EU TÔ PASSANDO MAL
Thanks for the black girl at the end. It really needed it.   Guarantee she’ll end up Atreus’s love interest.  Keep it woke, Sony. Thanks.
Finally
Esperava um trailer mais épico!
I got tears when kratos found TYR 😁
The black little girl was totally not justified....Norway in 800s had no black children
UWU
*sees Tyr rise above Kratos* Me: *"Now kiss"*
I need this
Solo es para ps5 lpm
Its not "Boy" anymore.....its "Little Man" now
I love how the Modern GOW games are kratos trying to put his gangster pass behind him. His kid talking about he need to to think like a general.....DO YOU KNOW WHAT HES DONE
When will the game release   Girl: you'll get your answers soon enough... some of them
Why there is a black child
DAD OF BOY IS BACK 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
🙌🏻🙌🏻🤝🤝
GOTY INCOMING
I’m gonna cry
LET'S GOOOO IT'S TIME TO CUT ENEMIES WITH THE LEVIATHAN AXE ONCE AGAIN!!!
DU KRALEO!!!!!!!! PORR@!!!!!!
Thor and Odin fight bought to break YouTube when people start uploading them
why do i feel like tier & kratoz might throw some hands?
Everything is fine except for the last frame.
Sony destruindo a concorrência como sempre 💙💪
- Baldur saying "i thought you'd be bigger" makes lot of sense now
1:11 that soundtrack is just full of adrenaline.
Kratos is not Atreus Father.
not impressed
Pero para cuando la fecha de cratos
1:46 Kratos vs Battletoads
Atreus: "Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" Kratos: "Another ashes bath"
Ya era  hora chucha
3:05 it´s freya....they traveled in time o.O or He ;V
Nice! Very very very nice! I’m definitely looking forward to this game! Nice! Very very very nice! Playstation has won!
Thor : "You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  Kratos : "Dah"
Can I play it in ps4 pro ?
I cannot wait.
Now Asgard has to worry about two war gods, a developing lord of mischief, and the severed wisdom Lord's head. This is gonna be EPIC!!!
Kratos 1 thunder gods 0 !
Mano, vou ter que comprar um PS5 :´(
Finally heard of it
Someone calls Ragnar and Bjorn 🔈
So we got 2 gods of war Kratos and Tyr!
2:54 is literally the Tyler1 with the tall reporter lady meme XD
Can y’all say GOTY!
okay but if atreus goes by loki in the future, i'm gonna be really sad
Efsooo
See's girl that looks suspiciously like calliope  Kratos: it.. it can't be...
Who is the tall man?
Preparing my Wallet for this 🥺
CADE A RAPAZIADA BR AI PORRA 🇧🇷
“You must prepare yourself.”
Βάλτε τον Φιλ Σπενσερ να είναι στους κακούς
*Kratos gon' be smashin' Odin and Thor into PIECES!*
Is that Josh Brolin as Thor?
A moment of silence for everyone who thought Kratos and Tyr were the same person
Kratos se va pareciendo al rey bárbaro
Asta la nuera de kratos sale al final... Por la que alcance a ver.
Tyr has both of his hands
.INCREIBLE.
Top
“Are you a calm and reasonable person?”  Kratos: *flashbacks ripping Helios head off, chopping Hermes’ legs off* Kratos: “Sure!”
I hope Sony dubs this game in Greek just like they did the last one. Please! 🙏
is this a dlc or a new game I'm legit confused
Ok eu estou em choque 😀👍
let's goooooo❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ummm, my guess is that this game takes place shortly after the events of previous game, so why does Atreus' have completely different voice (actor)?
The same game 2
Creo que si estuviera únicamente desarrollado para PS5 gráficamente se vería mejor (no digo que se vea mal) pero creo que podría verse aun mejor, buen punto que no hayan puesto una fecha de salida, es mejor que salga cuando este listo
OwO
TOTAL HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Fu… its DLC ?
Atreus is no longer a BOI
So this brought me to the hospital and I've been diagnosed with gamer goopy goblin brain 🧠
Josh Brolin how are ya?
I CAN’T WAIT EEEUUUGGHHHH
Não vejo a hora de descer Thor e Odin na paulada
Why does feel and look like a long waited DLC expansion vs a new game?
se sair para o ps4 vo compra,nem que eu tenha que vender minha irmã
Will we also see it on Ps4?
Ps4 F 😞
I can not wait baby
I'm so excited but why should there be centaurs in Ragnarok?
GOTY com certeza!!!!
Loki: "Come Father let's spar." Kratos: "So be it."
Ooooh, the hype is real already
Its amazing! I will stream the previous Gow because of that trailer
Any word on who the voice actor for Atreus is? I can't find anything.
Fiquemos loucos, fiquemos eufóricos. O Ragnarok está chegando, meus players!
Boy!
*BOY*
They got game if the year in the bag
Kinda wished the boy grew out of that hairstyle by now. This is amazing and i cant wait for this game. Really hope they add more and polish it more. This is just the reveal trailer so it still has a ways to go. I can tell
LET'S GO!
same graphics even worse
I screamed when I saw this in my recommended.
game of the year 2021????
هاي صدك
Phenomenal
Looks like Ratchet and Clank.
راح اموت
Thor : "You seem like a calm and reasonable person."  Kratos started bashing all the enemies on his path..
Didn't expect Tir to be a mountain. Glad to see more dwarfs and maybe humans in this too. I would like to see more of the realms in this game heck even if they show what happened to Greece.
dont get me wrong it looks great but it also does look a little samey.. maybe its just the environments but id be lying if i said im blown away
Its so EPIC!
راح اتخبللل
Gadão de Odin
Got to get a PS5 soon, doesn’t look like this will have a PS4 release
oh i mess how he says Booooii 😔💜
release date?
anyone else notice two ravens when mimir says odins got tricks up his sleeve
2:46😲😲😲😲😲   2:53😲😲😲😲
Congratulations!, The Next GOTY SURE
Freya cutted Krato's shield like butter
thank you, no useless cinematic trailer. Straight up gameplay, that's what matters!
Is Thor’s VA Josh Brolin?????
who is the last guy ?
This game + DualSense controller = 🤯🤯
BOI
I am lost for words. I am sooo EXCITED!!!!
3:17 minutes of trailer. And It didn’t disappointed 👍
I don´t know but i want to see Freya with her Valkyrie wings in this game.
So excited to see kratos’ fight between thor
Music is weird but the rest looks awesome
Can’t Wait :)
Why black girl?
boi
Isn't it weird that Loki and Kratos' sleigh is powered by two wolves?
Ayy
Look like DLC 2018
Can't wait to see for more of Kratos calling Atreus BOI!!.
Mas de lo mismo
I bet the answer has something to do with going woke so BLM doesn't call a game set in ancient Scandinavia culture, history and mythology "racist" for being accurate... 🙄
Best game ever made
WHERE IS SOCOM
Kratos to thor is like: "You picked the wrong house fool"
More Dad of Boy action!!!
is there any information concerning the freedom of gameplay ? I would love to see Kratos with a sword...
Thor is about to get whipped
Tive a mesma sensação Foda de quando foi anunciado o Gow 2018. Ansioso por essa dlç de game <3
Welcome ❤️🔥
"Stop thinking like a fathef for a moment"  Yeah and you're gonna be the one left alive with him
Does someone want to explain the little black girl in Norse mythology?
When it comes to the world of investing,most people don't know where to start.fortunately,great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance
what an amazing time to be alive
462 salty Xbox fans 😂😂😂
Soooooo perfekt 🙏🏻❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Oh BOY I'm excited! 😉
Have my money Sony at this point keep my wallet
I dont see  much difference from 4. Boring
Is that James Spader voicing Thor?
I Will play on PS4
وينة جماعتنه اثبتوا حضوركم بلايك 🔥🔥🔥🔥
yo creo que Santa Mónica hizo un excelente trabajo en el 1 que en el 2 no había mucho esfuerzo que hacer , se sigue viendo bien pero no sorprende como lo fue el primero
TE AAAAAAMO KRATOOOOS
That easter egg with the deer and Atreus. 🤤
De mais extremamente feliz e ansioso pra pó minhas mãos em mais uma obra de arte dessa 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
Is that Tyr ?
when you got to max out Blade of Chaos and Leviathan Axe again-  wait aren't we actually maxed these two weapon already?;
Esse trailer me fez perder o nofap

Cannot wait to jump into this
📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
This game is gonna be cold 🥶
can't wait
Tyr has both his hands still based on what I saw. If Fenrir appears then it will be awesome.
Espectacular tráiler
Lütfen tr dublaj olsun yahu
All that I was waiting for
That little touch at the end‼️ When the titles shown and everyone’s thinking “when’s the release date” and it goes  “ you’ll get your answer soon enough… we’ll some of them” with that girl talking, nicely done SM Studios 👏😁
I still can’t believe we are gonna get a sequel this fast. HYPED lets goooooooooooo
Flato el logo de PS4 como prometieron los de Santa Monica Studio. Hay que cumplir con lo que se dijo, espero que así sea Muchachos.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT!!!
I creamed
A new GoW trailer, a new Matrix trailer... my hearth cant handle all this emotion!!
Is that Josh Brolin the mad Titan himself? 2:08
Blades of Chaos... Back to square one.
🤩🤩🤩🤩😱😱😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
😃por fin el tráiler ahora a esperar el juego se ve muy bien 😍
🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
I-I shat myself
GOTY!!!
It’s not for ps4?
THIS IS EPIC
Is that just me or Atreus is voiced by Tom Holland in this one ?
atreus grew up 🔥🔥🙂
Of course... liberal token girl at the end
Is there gonna be for PS4 too?
Mais uma aventura de Cleiton, o bom de guerra.
Is that big nice for ever realy realy nice its perfect
Vou deixar o meu predict: a menina que aparece é a angroboda, mulher de loki. Nesse jogo vai ter um relacionamento entre ela e o atreus, sendo que no final do jogo, por alguma razão, vai originar a jormungander (n sei escrever) e o lobo fenrir. Na última cena, irá aparecer o Odin, dps de Kratos ter matado todos a sua volta, dando brecha pro último jogo dessa trilogia. Provavelmente terá um combate, no próximo jogo, entre Odin e fenrir ou com a jormungander!  Anotem!! Obs: no insta da santa mônica já foi revelado o rosto de Thor, e na moral, tá parecendo o Thor gordão da Marvel kkkkkkkkk
2:50, So was Kratos standing in between Tyr's legs? Watched this way too many times I guess 😅
Lança logo Sony estou ficando louco pra assistir
Vai ter pra PS4
انيك الرجوله
2:25 That one from greek mythology 😱😱
Is this coming to ps4?
Legal
War is not an option but here I go killing hundreds of living sentient beings.                                          -videogame logic just works
ja
Eh hora de comenzar a ahorrar para comprar esos juegazo
Ps4 ????
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Love that in the beginning of the trailer, it almost looks like Atreus has some antlers on his head
Odin so done
So now we butch the Allfather!
isso vai dar um trabalho
2:07 after im done with Thor imma whisper “Thanos sends his regards “
Muito foda
After flipping through quite a few comments, I’m honestly surprised I’m not seeing more people disappointed in Loki’s new looks. I really am not a fan of his little faux hawk thing goin on.  Also kindda bummed to see they Tyr lives. Was hoping Kratos was Tyr.
Joder ya quiero ver como hacen thortilla a thor xd
Caralho vai ser uma bela continuação desse jogo que venha logo.
Niice there are some civilization now, Villages and stuff 🔥
This looks like DLC than a sequel.
I jumped from PS4 to PC recently  I need to find magical money for a PS5 now...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This. Is. The. Best. Thing. EVER!!!! EVER!!!!!!
Is it just me or is the voice asking Kratos sounds veeery similar to Jason Momoa's.
Ps4andps5 ❤️🤍❤️🤍
W
Heads up Thor, Kratos is not a calm person
Going from BOY to Bigger BOY
Thor, please be a boss battle
Is that Pandora?
And of course, a game about Norse mythology, a black girl. GOW Netflix edition. 1
This seems like an award winning game, is it an award winning game?
When’s the release?!?!?  “You’ll get your answers soon enough…”  Lol, nicely done Santa Monica, nicely done.
Thor: “You seem like a calm and reasonable person that murdered both my kids and my half brother!”
Yes! Been waiting for this!
So who'll be the next Valkyries?
I love the trailer!!!!!!!! Everything seems to be excellent!!!!! I’m so excited!!!!! This is what happens when you keep your expectations low 😉
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person... But why am I hearing boss music playing?!
SE VIENE
😱😱😱😱 yeesssssss!!!!
TO ASGARD!!!
Its great to see Teal'c speaking to Thor again
Will it be available on PlayStation 4?
I’m so so SO glad Mimir is back
AAAAAAAAAAND  I'm getting a PS5

Kratos and his daddy issues are back.
Game of the year!!
Finally some incentive to buy a PS5
LETS GOO ITS TIME
I'm about to cry, I'm so excited!!! Kratos and Atreus!! <333
2:55 Man, last time Kratos had to crane his neck this far to talk with someone was like... Hercules from GoW 3
Come onnnn 😱🔥🔥🔥🔥
Atreus:Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general  Kratos: Noooo!!  We all know who he was as a general. A crazy no mercy fighting maniac. I hope he will become the general he use to be when he see he has no choice!!!
Game of the year.
That was very beautiful
Thank you.
Bom da Guerra!!!
:> it is time
Super hyped!!!!
Game Of The Year
Rest in peace xbox fan boys 🙏😭
Run on ps4 ????
2023 or 2024???
Sony, please tell me I’ll actually be able to get my hands on a PS5 by the time this game comes out.
Am I the only one who misses the old Kratos?
Sees that there is no release date at the end of the trailer. “You’ll get your answers soon enough… well some of them.”  That does not make me feel better.
Wins Game of the Year already.
If Christopher judge doesn't win this game awards I swear I will be angry this is one of the best acting I have ever seen this movie 🎥 goin to be epic
My body is ready! My feelings aren’t!
Nice to see that Atreus still has his dope haircut.
❤️❤️
*se le para*
Tbh looks more like PS4 Pro game
Calidad de juego
Thor is SO gonna get it…
Alguien noto los cuernos insinuando a loki al principio cuando entra Atreus
So Tyr is clearly half giant.
I'll secure my PS5 when this comes out
That's cool and all, but is Sunny Suljic still Atreus?
Now finally i have a reason to buy a PS5. If I'm able to see one to buy it...
Might aswell return my xbox now…
i cant waittt🔥🔥🔥🔥
The tale of the Variant 2018 named Loki "Atreus" Kratosson
I just came.
Kratos need to tell his tale to his son like ASAP
Ps4?:( build?:(
Esperemos que traiga buenas armaduras, variedad de enemigosy bosses
Has anyone noticed that Tyr still has his right hand/arm? As in Norse myth he looses it specifically to Fenrir when Odin tried to restrain him. Hmmmmm
I love how sequels have the same gameplay but new content and features. Reminds me of Mario Galaxy 2.
30fps no ray tracing?
Gimme 2
Overhyped.
DIOSSSSSSS. ❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😢
Xbox fan: jejejeje dislike.
I really hope we can go to the other realms that we didn't get to go last time, especially Asgard.
mudo porra nenhuma
Me Before the showcase : Keep your expectations low boy . After the showcase: I'm hyped and my my expectations are high 🤣
Gotta have that token black girl
Who is the girl at the end?
STOP Porting games to PC.... Uncharted does NOT belong on PC.
Que épicooooo
The End Begins AGAIN!
Beautiful
1:47
YES!
Como que la pubertad no favoreció a Atreus
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T WAIT TO SMASH THOR WITH HIS OWN HAMMER
We may have gotten scammed out of a GTA 6 but Santa Monica has always been their to save us.
Who is that giant guy at the end
Só vem!
Imagine you wake up, and see this on morning lol
BOY! Sounds so much like Tom Holland, nice
Can we talk about how the opening scene is clearly after when it's bright and sunny, but the wrist chains and blades are gone?!
And to think I was all out of milk but Rockstar sure knows how to yank our utters. Thank you
😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
I hope the girl at the end was Calliope
Can’t wait to play this!
My Eyes Are Watering 🥰 Bravo PlayStation BravfuckingO
HE HAS HEARD OF IT!!!!! LETSSSS GOOOOO
Where is the button if double like?? 😏🤔🔥🔥🔥
Wonder if you will be able to transfer data from gow4
When do ore orders start
Ragnarok is having a Super Mario Galaxy 2 treatment huh.
💖💖
I saw different shields are now apart of kratos arsenal he had a wall shield he slammed into the ground and one shaped into an oval maybe used to make parries easier
Aww Man im soooo ready for this Game..  u didnt disappointed us santa monica and Sony 😍😍😍
I AM SO EXITEED
We  EATIN
Thor’s voice sounds intimidating asf.
Cry on ps4
YES!
Please port 4 and Ragnarok to PC.
Is this going to be released on PS4 also?
The guy from Fortnite is getting his own game, that's cool
1:56 kratos became sage.
is that liam nesson as thor??holy F!
Yooooooooo
GAME OF THE YEAR
😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍PS4  PS5
Melhor jogo que já inventaram
como hago para verlo si tiene restricción de edad?
BEST GAMER EVER!!! ATÉ O MOMENTO SERÁ O UNICO DO PLAYSTATION QUE IREI JOGAR!!
The greatest trick Kratos ever pulled in this realm is that he can convince all realm that he looks like a calm and reasonable person 😂
I can't wait anymore!!!
OMFFFFFFFKKKKNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGG! Plug this into my veins! 😭 😭 😭 😭
EXCLUSIVO DE PS5?
The last character in modern American culture that is allowed to be masculine 🙏🏽
Boy is no more a boy! Wonder what he will call him other than Atreus!
Another GOTY incoming
ARE YOU A CALM AND REASONABLE PERSON?
Lessssssssssss goooooooo
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
It’s been too long…..BOY🔥‼️
Now THIS will be the Knack 2 killer.
I'm ready
Is that Josh Brolin????
This will be absolutely the game of the Year!
Hopefully we get more blood and humanoid enemies.
Finalmente😍
Can't wait for PewDiePie to play this!
A la mierda :00000
Boi looks like Reece from Malcolm in the Middle.
The wolves carrying the sleigh are skoll and haati aren’t they? So I’m guessing our heroes (Kratos and Atreus) are the harbingers of Ragnarok.
TO DE PAU DURO!
Can’t wait to kill more GODs for real
Aterus:"Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general" OG players:.....you sure about that?
hyyyyppppe
Can’t wait to see what the Valkyrie equivalent enemies are.
GOW 4 - DLC
DLC GOW
Not to be racist at all, I’m genuinely asking this question because I’m confused, but why is there a black girl at the end of this trailer? Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t this all supposed to be based on Norse mythology? Are they just trying to be inclusive or am I missing something?
Same game?
Great, now I gotta buy a PS5!
Is Thor voiced by Josh Brolin? Certainly sounds like him
Ahora solo necesito un análisis de TRAILERAMA sobre este video y seré feliz 🔥🔥🔥
Atreus gameplay comming? :0
Boy isn't a boy anymore 😂
I’m sad Kratos won’t be calling Atreus “BOI” anytime soon 😔
Crl que foda maluco pqp não vejo a hora de pegar o PS5 pra jogar esse, valeu muito a pena ter platinado o GoW, só vem Ragnarok 😍😍😍
Atreus is going to be annoying.
Kleitão da guerra esta de volta!!!!
What about ps4 ?can we play it on it?
YEEEEES!!!
Locks like a DLC for the last version
Show !!
R.I.P in peace. Xbox and pc
NOOOOOOOOSSA SENHORA ESSE TRAILER FOI EPICO FINALMENTE
GOTYYYYY
👎😔
Can someone talk about the girl that appeared in the end 🧐🧐🤔
So many questions I think the only one we need to know right now when is it gonna be available
Lots of reused assets. PS4 will hold this game back, unfortunately.
Wow
Lets goooo
Is it going to be on ps4
Xbox: Odin is with us Ps5: No he is not
<3
I so happy now
Man the PS4 is holding hard the PS5 :V
Date????!!!!!!😡😡😒
This trailer has a disturbing lack of *BOY*
OPE!
im glad they made atreus a little older and changed his voice (as it should when you get older) it just adds an extra layer to the game to me...i cant wait for this
Only in ps5
Es bello y perfecto! 😍🙌🏼🎮💜
Woaw
brutality
Yes
Tyr and  Kratos Tag-Team !!! With Atreus Triple Threat !!! Yes goddammit!!!
The motion cap on this game looks insane!!
I'm so excited to see how this will end! :'D
Here we go 😍😍
Gráfico mudou nada
This was honestly disappointing, looks like a dlc for gow 2018
DLC 😔✅
I was hoping to hear some of the "boy" comments. But it's a stretch.
How they nerfed the weapons?
😍
Please welcome more enemy and boss types along with some more gore. Please
Me moje
I can't wait!!.... to watch the gameplay on Youtube :C
Meu amigo... Q delícinha de game.
LETS GOOO
? Ps4 😟
I just hope we wont have to wait another whole game to fight odin. Probably will be the case though
THOR: BRING ME KRATOOOOOOOSSSSSS
KRATOS TE AMOOOOOO
Sheraa!!!!
I see what you did there with Atreus carrying the deer.
This is what we WANTED
at least boi could that hair line in order my guy
Finally 😭😭
Game of the year already
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
crazy how Tyr looks down on Kratos
So the ending of the trailer🤷🏾‍♂️
😍😍😍🔥😍😍
Looks like PS4
Just don't kill off Kratos. Hate the trend of replacement protagonists.
❤️💙❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like Atreus gonna get a girlfriend!
Boss af

It says 2021 i guess? Yes ?
They just had to put a black girl at the end.....

I won’t get tired of watching this
how much i love this game i can't wait man woooooooow
So I must be the only noticing Huginn and Muninn flying off huh?!💀💀
Atreus has Grown. Now must call him.....: "Teennn!"
I was eagerly watching this trailer even I didn't know where to focus  (─.─||）  thanks for this amazing game Sony 💜
Dislikes are from xbox and pc lamers 😂😂😱😱🔥🔥
Nooo this is the las game
LET'S THROW HANDS WITH THOR BABY !!! 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder what reason they will give for Kratos having to upgrade everything all over again.
Nah loki is in somewhere in tva
I would hang myself on a tree for 18 days to play this game right now.
Game of the Year again!
Oh no...Another kids relationship 3:04

Playstations unbelievable lately congratulations honestly
Seems like Atreus isn‘t a BOY anymore! 🔥
BOI
My birthday is officially complete I love it! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wasn't impressed with this looks like GOW 2018 cross-gen is definitely hurting this game
looks more like a dlc than a new game.  hope for  new weapons
Ohhhhh

Xboxers llorando 3, 2 1...
F KRATOS
Cant wait for ragnarok 🔥🔥
Ps 4, no?
I hope its cames out on PS4
Low key wish they'd just ditch the PS4 and old hardware. This game looks fantastic, but I feel like it would look amazing if it were made solely for the PS5
i cant believe we finally saw it
Wolverine, Spider-Man 2, GOW. My ps5 is gonna bust from all the great games
منورين خالي...😜😂❤️🌷
My boy atreus older man I’m happy asf
Is this a DLC?
1:34 the axe goes through the blades. what a classic game moment
La muchacha del final era laaa cevichiica

I was really hoping freya would be chill
war is not the only way.... he has changed so much
Indeed Game has no limits. This is love🥰
Thank you
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Suddenly my 5 years old son needs a ps5
Tyr is alive.
Looks like Boy found himself a gf😭😂
Is that Sigyn at the end?
You seem like a calm and reasonable person Cracks the whip so hard they implode
BOY
I just want to be able to jump! 😣
“Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general”  Kratos: *Slowly pulls out the belt* BOY….
Why I don't use Xbox that much anymore
I cannot wait to finally murder another pantheon
When everyone one Loki as adult, and they giving us the same annoying kid but 2 years more older, making problems
Atreus tetosterone went crazy :V
Kratos see Tyr* Kratos: I thought it was bigger
THE GHOST OF SPARTA IS BACK.
NO WAY LES GO BOYSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
That’s it… PlayStation won yet again
My body is ready.
My testoesterone is rising to unimaginable levels
I wonder if Kratos will finally stop holding back in this game.
AEEEEEEEEEE KARALHOOOOOOOOOOO
todos los comentarios españoles se pueden notificar abajo
,💪
Imagine the chaos Kratos will have caused if Atreus was a Loki variant and the TVA came and collected him
Is it just me or I see no difference between PS4 and PS5 GOW graphics?
“Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a General”   Kratos: All the other gods with the pumped up kicks. You better run better run, faster than my blades. 🎶
Mimir!!!!

Ok take my money
A black girl in nordic mythology? When will people get tired of this cringe diversity?
Este es el comentario en español que estabas buscando.
nice DLC
Just for ps5?
How much you wanna bet the begining of the trailer is going to be the main menu screen with Kratos sitting next to the campfire and when you start the game Atreus appears behind Kratos.
Pullllll
*I am ready for Ragnarök.*
DIOSSSS
زۆرخۆشە
Cross gen trash.
Guess I'm buying a PS5 now

Mi corazón acaba de sentir algo de nuevo después de mucho tiempo.
This is a day one buy for me

lets be honest this game is gonna set the final war for the next game, like the old trilogy where Kratos invades Olympus
If you have an xbox nows the time to throw it into the garbage
EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:05 Is that supposed to be Angrboda🤨😑
this is the reason to get a ps5 :D
I'm scared that it'll be the same game gameplaywise, with only a few mechanics 😥 I don't say it was bad, but I wanted it to be betta'

Kratos vs Thor is gone give every gamer a heart attack
LETS GOOOOOO
Блять.. придется плойку покупать!!!)
Português por favor
TYR WAS ALIVE?!?!!
Looks too similar to the last one to me, similar gameplay and landscapes, kid following you everywhere being annoying, maybe if Kratos went to space? That would be cool
Atreus: Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general   Kratos: Ask your half sister about that….
Ufff...
DUDE SO STOKED!!!! 🙏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Will play this but not on extreme this time lol.
Boi
Lets GOOO i cant wait
Well I've never heard of it
Dislikes are from xbox 360 gamers

👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Gameplay☝️💪
Still amazing as always 👍
*Heavy breathing*
argrrgrg can't waittt
well I was torn between xbox and the ps5 and well now i'm sold
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Yes finally let’s freaking go!!!!!🔥🔥
É filhão, o bicho tá vindo 🔥
Atreus: Stop acting like a father and start acting like a gen.. Kratos: No!! At: Jeez what's so wrong with acting genuine
SIMPLESMENTE INCRÍVEL
3:05 НЕТ,NOOOOOOO И ТУТ НЕГРЫ!!!
Atreus gotten taller, and it seems Freya reclaimed her Warriors Spirit. Dang, Tyr is alive and huge. Wonder who that girl is?  Thor asking Kratos if he's a calm and reasonable, but wonder if Thor is?
BRUV, Tyr is a big lad !
Now how cool would it be if Chris Hemsworth did the voice of Thor
the other realm was opened right now? and that giant man is really Tyr? I playing all this franchise and cannot wait for this game
agora só falta a data de lançamento
when ?
THE REAL KRATOS IS LOADING…  I’ve already got hyped for this❤️🤤
Bro that's a DLC.
And that ladies and gentlemen is where microsoft and playstation part ways Sony will always have better exclusives...
Lovin’ those Loki horns at the start
301 👎 are Microsoft players hating and crying 👀😢
Wonder how this and Horizon is gonna be in PS4. I hope the frame rate is stable !
Es ermoso
Kratos: "I shall destroy Asgard." Thor: "But Asgard isn't a place, it's a people." Kratos: "Exactly."
BRUH THE HYPEEEEE 😂
Ps4 ؟؟؟
I know how this ends… Hela will be the final boss but in the end she’s unbeatable, that’s when Surtur is released and Asgard will be destroyed. Kratos Thor and the remaining Asgardians take a ship to Earth where they’re met by Thanos and half of the people on the ship are murdered :(
I miss Zeus
Épico
When does it come to the consoles (PS4 & PS5)?
This game has no right of looking this sick🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Game's gonna be straight 🔥 Ragnarok is coming! We must prepare ourselves lol 😆
That girl at the end has to be Angrboada.
LETS GOOOOOOO
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
oooo my ps4 eill automatic destory when i play gow5
Nice DLC (that I won't buy) but where's Ragnarok?
Lets gooooooo
This is why i am proud to be PS player ❤
take my money please !!!!
I expected so much more...
Aircombos and stuff from the originals please. Also proper platforming not braindead press O perfect jump.
TYR??!?!??!!!?!!!!!!
Freya looks like she is on the rag!!
... BOY...
Cant wait to use the Blades Of Chaos again and does anyone know who the girl is at the end?
This game is hype. Would have loved a release year at least, nevermind a date. Wolverine and Spiderman 2 really show Insomniac is on a mission this gen as well.
Sony stocks: we are going to get so high tonight.
TYR!!!! 2:51!!!
Epic 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
😍
It will be on PS4?
I'm not crying. Nono
my life literally revolved around this entire franchise.
Is it coming on ps4?
Amazing
👎
Our boy is all grown up.  Also the girl in the end was Angrboða  Jötunn. One of the last giants. In Norse Mythology is wife of Loki, mother of a Fenrir, Jörmungandr and Hel.
Kratos: Boy Atreus: Im already a teenager Kratos: Boy, read this Atreus: .....
Only on ps5 😭😭😭
No release date? Cool, cool, cool, cool.  Also, the li’ll lady at the end is supposedly a Giant.
que belleza 😍
JOSH BROLIN AS THOR!!!
Im a PC player since the 90's, never cared for consoles too much, but wow that was fakken impressive!
İs this dlc ? nothing has changed ? Remakestation 5 🤦🏿
2:11 look at those sausage finger
I m not expect from sony to present GOW trailer like this!👀
Date ???
Finally coming!!!
I miss the BOI already
"you get your answers soon enough well some of them" hmmmm... a hint to December psx event possibly???
I think Freya will try to attack throughout the game before switching sides again
Honestly…… it looks like a DLC
Yesssss
Não vai vir para o PS4
“In moments of crisis, panic does nothing, harness it, let it serve you.” Can’t wait
Te amo Sony lptm ❤️
I’m happy
It’s gonna feel weird seeing Atreus being a teenager now while playing the game
I'm disappointed to be honest
HYPE!!!!
Fodamente foda
GoW and Matrix reveal all in the same day? Nice!
The wolfs are skoll and hati?
Who's that supposed to be at the end?
👌👌👌👌👌
I was thinking about this game! Finally, a real trailer and not a teaser that shows a title 😀 3:05 Also the native Scandinavian is fantastic!
BOY, I'm ready for this
Ragnarok is coming!! Just can't wait
Tyr still got the eyes the giants gave him. That girl at the end is one of the vanir, I guess.
بشرفكم لا تسويها بي ٦٠ دولار 😂💔اريد العبها نزلو سعر بربكم
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" Kratos: * Cat has a Vietnam flashback*
Atreus: “Stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general”  Kratos: Does the tik tok dance ... lol
Nunca vou largar da PlayStation ♥️
Watched the trailer 2 times already
I can't put into words how excited I am for this!!! 🙌
So when is it!!!! Does aNYONE HAVE AN "ABOUT" RELEASE DATE ???
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
Tyr is UNIT
حماااااااااس
2021 is the best year of movies and games
Finally, the king has returned🔥
Что там черная делает?
*Thor knocks on kratos door*  Kratos:YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE,FOOL!
2:01 "You seem like a calm and reasonable person" Kratos, Meanwhile in the background : *Cuts a Draugr in half*
E se o Kratos ficar só chamando o Atreus de "jovem" durante o jogo inteiro??
Did anyone else see Atreus ride a spirit donkey
I-i never thought I’d see the day…. But BOY am I ready!
I creamed my pants when I saw the thumbnail
ديمممممممممم ولله الحماس فول 😮✌️
Now that's what I call a Masterpiece
PS4? :C
Booya!
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!
Sweet noe all I need is a PS5 and...oh wait..
So this is why I'm buying a PS5
The amount of boy voicelines in this game
Give way to wolverine 👑👑👑
finally 😂... Can't wait..Who is the girl in the ending 👀... I feel like in this game the biggest fight will be thor & save odin for the next game...
Nazheeeeee
Atrieus is annoying as always
OOOHHHH SHIIIIIIEEEEEETTTT
Finally!!!! I'm way too excited for this game.
ACEU its YOUUU
Anyone notice them hinting at Loki's "horns" during Atreus' silhouette entrance? Cool Easter Egg hinting at the near future.
Hopefully I’ll have a PS5 by the time this comes out. *cough cough* tighten up SONY
Starks were right all along. Winter is really here🥶
Si sale en 2022 goty
To be honest, the graphics are the same. Feels like DLC. Not much. And although the release date has not been disclosed, it is likely to be released after 2023.
This freaking game is the reason why I can’t switch to pc for gaming.
When the Helheim is the release date? 🙊
Never heard of it 2!!! Can't wait for this!
The Wait Is Worth It🔥🔥🔥🔥
Majorely excited
xbox rip🤣
Atreus face looks alot like Jaeden Martell now, I cannot wait for this game or spiderman 2 and best part is I managed to pre order a ps5 yesterday, took me 6 tried but I finally got one so I can't wait to pick it up when it's ready!!!!
Thor: “I'm here to stop Ragnarok!” Kratos: “I’m Ragnarok!”😎
Thanos is Thor Now
This Looks so Freakin' COOL, cant wait🔥
2023
It's Angrboda at the end... She is the mother of World Serpent and Loki's Wife.
Let's go can't wait to play
Finally🔥 Can’t wait to play😍
Looks last gen
I'm a xbox fan, but I'm thinking about buying a playstation just to play these games, I'm practically half xbox fan and playstation fan
Game of the year I can see u
PERFECTION.
I hope the executions are more brutal than the previous game.
Josh Brolin is that you?
Literally all i wanted
:')
PC
No one can dislike this video😍😍
I know I'm not the only one thinking this  Is this on PS4?
It looks like more a DLC than a game
More of the same
ماكو عربي اهنا
Asgard? Thor? Odin? can someone explain?
Se me arisa la piel me recuerdo que la primera ves que jugo GOW tenía 12 años ahora tengo 25..
Never did I click on a video so fast.
Не так давно создал канал и прошу глянуть пару видео, вдруг понравится ;) А Ragnarok пущка!
Release date would've been more than welcome
Thir? Wau
Thor : "You seem like a calm and reasonable person"  You didn't play previous games did you Thor ?
Imagine getting Mjolnir after Beating Thor
30% graphics increase is not GENERATION LEAP.
masterpiece
Taporra, o Deus da Guerra grego: Kratos resgatou o Deus da Guerra Nórdico: Tyr para impedirem juntos o Ragnarok.... Isso tudo enquanto seu filho Loki, o Deus da Mentira, questiona seus sua própria identidade...  Pressinto uma jornada épica!🔥
hope it will release for ps4 also
LET'S GO BOI!
Boy i done watch this video about 12x
Pelo vídeo não parece tão melhor que o anterior
Already watched this 10 times and counting

Atreus looks like Tom Holland.
Thanos wouldn't stand a chance against Kratos.
💙💙💙💙💙💙
The game looks incredible
😍
Finally the ghost of sparta is back🔥 I see no improvement in graphics tho just about the same as the game made 3 years ago
Finally ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰

Why's Atreus soo skinny? I expect him to be totally ripped - like his father.
В трендв
This looks trash

0:21 goosebumps with the music
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas , finally  i got my ps5 at perfect time :D
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS MADAFACKAAAAAS YEEEEEEEESSSSSS
At least we know why Baldur thought he'd be taller now.
Y para la ps4?
Is she Angrboda? Or Sigyn? :0
Thank you to the other studio that’s helping
Tyr is an absolute Chad
When is coming out
For anyone wondering, the girl at the end is one of the last giants and an important one at that, Angrbodas, Loki's wife
juego de mierda
When???!!!
POG
HEARD OF IT
It wasn't the 'diamond showcase' that I waited, even the graphics of this game. Seems PS4
Ima cry bro. They really need to get the PS5s out because this franchise alone is enough to sell them. The whole showcase was heat.
I need Alligator Atreus skin
Coração erra até às batidas
When are the preorders gonna happen?!?!?
Finaaaaaaaly!!!
So Kratos isn't hungry anymore?
KRL QUE FODA!!!!
The girl at the end is called Santa Monica.
Vamoooooooo
Boi get over here
Riko
😱😱😱😱❤️
Of course they had to insert a strong diverse female at the end... sigh
NO!
Ok so the game looks identical to the 2018 one which is not a bad thing but the draw distances look way longer and hopefully the hidden loadings will be easier to make
ATREUS GOT THE DEER
This what we've all been waiting for innit
ARGENTINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Xbox what are y'all doing
Judging by the number of dislikes, not many Asgardians are left...
Wait.. Atreus is Loki??
Show de bola. Não vejo a hora...
well not bad.
lol PS5pro? Seriously?! What a scam 😂
So this is only coming for ps5?
Am I the only one here whos not impressed by this... i mean its not bad at all but it looks kind a same as last one.. idk
“Yeah baby, that’s what I’ve been waiting for, that’s what it’s all about…. Woooooooooooooooo”
finally yes yes 😍😍😍😍😍
Seeing Tyr made me think this could have been called "Gods of War." Bring*(edit) back done multi-player
يس يس يس 😗
Thanks life for this game! (And Santa Monica mostly lol)
i want a ps5 0_0
Looks like a dlc lollll 😂😂😂
Releaseee datee??

EU TE AMO KRATOS
So... has Kratos remembered how to jump again?
Nunca antes me emocione tanto a la espera de un RAGNAROK. ATTE: CHAVELO el inmortal.
Why does the new Atreus have the most punchable face in a GOW game ?😅
Wooow finally ragnarok is here ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪
Toma mi dinero 💰

I can already hear my ps4 screaming in the background
Shut up and take my money!

Se tem adolescente, vai dá merda.
best PlayStation franchise finally❤️❤️
Eu achando q o atreus ia tar grande já🤡
PlayStation exclusives for the win !!!🖤
I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS! THE SOUNDTRACK SOUNDS CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and atreus is still annoying
This looks a little too much like PS4 one, not blown away by it.
I am crossing my fingers this lives up to the original
Unlike is like green tears
Porfin espera chota
WHAT ABOUT PS4???????
3:07 Calliope????
Looking forward to it!
This just feels like homecoming. Nothing strange in this trailer. This is just a sequel to a series I have grown up playing. Familiar yet new.
We hear again boyyyyyy
Jogaooo
Finally, The Boi is Back 😎
That “no”💀💀💀
cant wait to hear jokes about that octopus from Mimir!
Merch
there's no deference between this game and the last one.. sooo disappointing thing 🤦‍♂️
only ps5.?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
1 : Ps5 is worst console and that is fact. 2 : Only on ps startegy dont work. 3 : Maybe is time work make games on pc ?
I love kratos😘😘
I feel some betrayal vibe from Atreus
So is there any reason to get an Xbox now? I feel bad for Microsoft
Everything is great except  Atreus nose
تحياتي مصطفى السامرائي
An easy game of the year!
Why does Atreus look and feel like an upgraded version of Morty from Rick and Morty series?
hey atreus, do a kickflip!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
GOW♥️
AMAZING FCKN AMAZING
Atreus looks like he grown more over the game but who is the tall guy in the last of the video 2:54 and the last girl 3:05
who is the character from the end of the movie?
TEEN!
Finally GOW... 1.5?
que pedazo de juego
I forgot how small the axe is with out the upgrades
WILL IT BE ON PS4???
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
CADÊ OS BRASILEIROS FÃS DO CLEITÃO?
give PC version
Kratos: Did your mother ever tell you about the birds and the bees? Atreus: No, why? Angrboða: Hi 😘  Atreus: Tell me everything...
WE BETTER HAVE KRATOS SAY BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Boy has become TEEN
who was the last giant guy?
The graphics looks insane! The only game I see that seems like it is truly next gen
Kratos calling Atreus the entire game “Big boy!”
🔥🔥🔥
i may cry now💘💘😍😍😍
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is 🔥🔥🔥 😱😱😱
pffff i fking need it <33333333
The trailer is somewhat similar to 2018 GOW trailer ....The world serpent and Tyr's appearance was similar
Valhalla here I go!.
"Stop thinking like a father for once and start thinking like a general"  The worst things that happened to him happened because he couldn't think in any other way. War was his only option, and he doesn't want that for his son
Cool looking game, too bad only like 10 people will actually get to play it.
Seems like at this moment, 177 xboxers crying in the corner 😂
Poggies
YES WE PLAY AS KRATOS !!! NOT AS BOI! Gonna be honest the game looks lit and kratos with his new look is nice. Though his black coat reminds me of thors....
I’m very curious to know why freya can fight now because she literally can’t in the previous game. Atreus voice sounds pure puberty. Is it just me or does it look like that this game will be what miles morales is to Spider-Man in terms of a largish dlc reusing many assets? Don’t get me wrong I’m excited but concerned a bit
Finalmente estou feliz😍😍😍
Kratos is calm and reasonable person.
.
COMENTÁRIO BRASILEIRO QUE VOCÊ PROCURA
HYPE
Poha isso que é jogo caralhoooo
0:49  Kratos: Freya..... Freya: You knew this was coming Spartan..... Me: I mean we did but really Freya? Really?
Love the way Tyr stands up looking down on Kratos 🔥 It’s gonna be INSANE! 🔥
Pls be on ps4
My only regret switching to Xbox i wish the ps5 was cheaper 😭
AMAZIN!!!
Wow that's awesome👏✊👍
Ps4 ? Plz 🥲
Cross gen = Not worth the code it’s written in. I don’t but cross gen games.
I don't anyone wants Kratos to think like a general again....Or do we?
Yessirrrr
I'm sure there will be plenty of thought-provoking discussion about the girl at the end
We will be better.
Omfg, I’m so freaking excited 🤯🤩🔥💙
Cant wait to see more from the greek side
LET’S GOOOO
‘You look like a calm and reasonable person’ Thor’s either really brave or incredibly naive to go up to Kratos of all people and say he looks like a calm and reasonable person.
Ryan Hurst as Thor!!
Cant wait 😍
it's just for ps5, or ps4 too?
Anyone else think the new director of the game said to much
Sigyn? 3:06
My purse already crying
is she angrboda?
Big W
Please This is THE BEST NEW IN my LIFE LOOK AT THIS EVERYthing IS SAME BUT MUCH BETTER THIS IS HOW SHOULD Look EVERY SECOND part !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS  IS THE REASON WHY I AM GOING TO BUY PS 5
Atreus is longer Boi.....he is...BIG BOI
"Teenage Boi, read this"
I really hope that you can actually play with the sun and like switch between them.. for example each one got their own fighting style that's effective against certain enemy types That would be more fun than just playing with kratos and having the son support us like the previous game
Bro 2023 man
Let’s gooo
GAROTO!
wow 🔥
we need a thor skin
WHEN
The BOY has hit a growth spurt I see
So this is coming to ps4 too or just ps5?
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" " *NO* " Understandable, have a great day
Game of the Year
Finally the best game!
Come boy.. bring my wallet
And here is where this goes to history....
Just perfect
Imagine how much content is being left out because it’s cross gen. It’s unfortunate.
Das wird krank.
Masterpiece !
Neeeeee
“Stop thinking like a father for a moment & start thinking like a general”   Me: NO!
Hopefully they get rid of the open world and the combat is better.
The deer horns make atreus look like he is wearing Loki's helmet .
No release date yet. So excited.
Get the onions out of my sight !
Compare  this grafics with Black myth and the last is brutal, way better.
LOKI coming into the scene with the two Horns. Haha they’re geniuses! Can’t wait. Going to have to update my video sooner than later.
Who’s the kid at the end?
BOOOOIIIIII!!!
is it only on ps5?
the music is just excellente!
161 haters with an xbox
So is Kratos gonna call Atreus teen now?  😂
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 Finally!!! The long wait is now over 💖💖💖 I am very excited 😍
GoW was a graphical powerhouse for the PS4. This… honestly looks like it’s just on the same level. Should’ve been a PS5 exclusive.
😎😎😎 Estamos listos
I Choose violence <3
Ragnarok is coming 👌😎
You'll get your answers soon enough. Well, some of them.   No liking what they may mean.
HELLO KRATOS :)
PS4 ? 😒
Boy is no more a boy. He’s a teen-boy.
_Ok so anyone else think that girl was Hela for a moment?_
Top
This video hit 1 million views in record time

The vibes is uncontrollable right now
The Greatest PlayStation Video Game On Planet Earth!!!
Anyone else call their son Boy!?!
Yeees kratos

BOY

Dad Simulator: Ragnarok
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Are you a calm and a reasonable person?"  *L3 + R3*
Am I the only one who's missing Cory Barlog??
Day one!!!
PlayStation 4
ps4 or not??
Rien de nouveau c'est comme l'ancien jeux bofff!!!
🔥🔥🔥
This looks like PS4 graphics to me.
Por favor que esté para ps4:(
Atreus hit puberty
The ending is disappointment
Woah the graphics are dope! And Ragnarok what a suitable name
If ps5s aren't available by the time comes out I'm gonna snap. They keep showing games but you can't even get the systems
2022 game of the year
Nice!!!!!!!!!
Hope this will not be the last time we’re gonna see Kratos
Love u Santa Mónica 😍😍😍😍
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL I'M CRYING
Coming 2030
I'm Hyped man!!! Sony WON🔥🔥🔥 Hats off to all the Team!!!💥💥💥
imagine you have a ps5 we hope you can buy it at christmas😅
Nothing changed !!
Finally! The wait is over... i hope this game becomes another phenomenon.
BOY
2:51 Who is?
Finalmente, boy.
I sense much fear in you, young Loki.
YES!!!!!! 🙌🏽
Hmmm BOI has grown
Is it on ps4 too
Yes Brok is in the game😊
Best 😍
LET'S GO!!
So now, the time truly draws near. 😀💪🏾💯🎮
tears of joy
I was crying out of excitement for this announcement:  Kratos: NO!  Me: ok I'll cry silently 🙌😭
So who's that guy at the end??
Assuming that's thor talking to Kratos betweem 2:00-2:10. Its sounds alot like josh brolin. Well at least to me
All I can say is wow
Santa Monica studeo game play fentestic., amazing trailer.. nice job
Game of 2022
WOOOOWOOOOWOOOOW😍😍😍
how many f bombs does brock got for us this time? we ready.
Wish this was in 60fps 💀💀💀
Gráficamente está bien muy bien pero ningún gran salto respecto a la actualización  del anterior para la PS5. Un poco decepcionado en ese sentido.
Oh, it’s just dlc
No release date?
Notice how the silhouette of Atreus/Loki approaches like he has horns himself. Proper Loki
Yesss finally but unfortunately I still don't have ps5 yet 🤣 wwkwkw
Looks a lot like the last one…right? Because it’s cross gen?
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
2:55 Kratos: Tought you'd be bigger. But you're definitely the one.
👌❤️👍
Never heard of it
BOY !
How many times am I going to rewatch this trailer?  A lot.
Slightly disappointed :/
thanks to the director, we know odin is the final boss, that the girl is a giant, thanks for telling us that, there is no way some of us wanted to find out about that ourselves.
Masterpiece!
Cory Barlog is probably a co writer or something, I feel like he has as much dad energy for this series as Kratos has for his son but if not I'm excited to see what happens.
Ragnarok is here Baby ❄️
No release date ???
Guys this is not even final product
جماعه اكس بوكس احا 🙃
Boyy
SO HYPED OUT🔥🔥🔥
I don't care if it's 70$ I buy it dayyyyyy oneeeeeeee
Xbox officially lost with this line up
This makes me wanna buy a PS5 again.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
uuuuoooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
but the gamepass.... RIP XBOX....
So, who is that tall hipster looking like guy anyway?
Agora o cleitao vai parar o Ragnarok, o herói eim
I love you gbg
The hype is real 😭
This game is so great.  (santa monica and sony are  the best )
👍
I bet this will come out and I still won’t have a ps5
I just became one of those blonde girls at a Shawn Mendes or Justin Bieber concert after seeing this
Too much movement that needs 60fps not 27-30fps
BOY
I'm actually crying, hopefully I can get a PS5 by the time it's released 😭😭😭😭
Vamooos
Mimir: Do NOT go there, understand?  2:15 Looks like we're heading there. :D
Curious to see what the skill tree is gonna be like. Seen a lot of the same moves from the previous game but I’m hoping they added plenty of new ones.
Just a heads up: Centaurs are from Greek Mythology, which we have faced before in previous GoW titles. Conclusion?  2 hypothesis (imo):  1: Kratos goes back to Greece for some reason. 2: Greece comes to us for some reason.  LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I can already see it now. Tyr gonna be another Lady Dimitrescu
Ragnarok is finally upon us...          Also The BOY is gonna get a gf🥰
Instant Replay
The tone of the game is already much more different than the last game.
No lie, we have got to see more GoW 1-3 references in here, just imagine the discussions Kratos will have with Atreus when he asks about the gods of his pantheon lol  Atreus: "So father, who is Hermes and what was he like?"  Kratos: *Remembers his last moments* "All I know is, he got some serious Olympian Air Forces, boy."  Atreus: "Oh."
Josh Brolin plays Thor?
😍😍
BOY
Oh this is going to be EPIC! 🤩
that silhouette of the atreus at the beginning with the horns... Loki is so dope
Best game of the year I’m calling it rn
GOW 2 . GOTY 2.
+Are you calm and reasonable person? Me who played all gows:  -Well yes, but actually no.
3:04 what Norse mythological giant was of African decent? Angrboða has always been depicted white with auburn hair.
😍😍😍😍😍
Kratos my man you lost your max lvl weapons again???
oh *BOI* here we go againnnn
Hey guys....Meet you all in RAGNAROK!!
So bad with that kid !!!!  We need same pa3 parts
"Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general" You don't wanna go there boiii
It looks like a DLC lol
This and Knights of the old republic remake has made my day, no my entire year im absolutely beyond hyped. I had low expectations of this showcase but this and Kotor remake Blew me away. Please PLEASE come out with both next year and not 2023
Badass
Callense ingleses
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Imagine this on the PS5 SSD, minimial loads times, much richer and larger worlds
Boy
When is this coming out?
I hope they dont Kevin Smith this since Cory isn’t directing it. You know show us this but its really mostly about that girl at the end
Wolverine ratio
Que pasó no hiba a salir también en el ps4?
Perfection
My Boi Atreus hunting deers by himself now they grow up so fast…
Love it !!!
This is looking promising. Imma get a PS5 for this.
"You'll get your answers soon enough. Well, some of them." Yep definitely meant for us.
Holy molyyy dude finally thank uuuuu 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❣️❣️❣️
HOLA
When is the game coming out for spiderman 2 they said 2023. And is this game going to be ps5 exclusive or is it also coming to ps4
Brace People !!! Real Games Incoming......
🤑🤑🤑🤑
Will it come for ps4 also ??
Finally.. I wish i have PS5😂
😍😍😍
We didn't get a Release date... so I'm guessing 2022 or 23 like Spiderman 2.
Looks promising! Its me or I saw many creatures that are not norse like the centaurs or the crocodile monster. The girl from the end is Angrboda!
Cállese y tome mi dinero
It felt underwhelming.
Finalmente😍😍😍
GOTY already.
My body is ready !
tyr be like: what's up shorty
GOTY confirmed
Black women in skandinavian mifology. Bravo😂
60fps when?
Yaaaaaaasssssss, what a day to be aliveeeeeee!
TIME TO BUY A PS5
😍😍😍
ok, i think i was expecting more bc it looks like a ps4 game, but yeah, its gonna be great anyway. Cant wait until exclusive ps5 games.
I congratulate you all dear brothers and sistets! The patience was worth it! Cheers fellow gamers!
This would look a lot better if it wasn’t coming to ps4
Kratos bota thor pra mamar !!!
jajaja vivo en latam :(
Straight fire 🔥
datessss
Game of the century here it comes
I hate that my last thought leaving this trailer was why's there a random black girl in this amalgamation of nose mythology
I hope this is on ps4 also
It will only be on PS5?
What a joke, it looks the same as 2018 one, they even reuse the same animations
I'm way too hype for this Game
Take my money
كفوووو وربي العشق
I just got goosebumps from this.
I'm so hype! That Tyr (which would ordinarily be a big reveal) is in the trailer makes me believe that this game has a whole lot to offer.  Prepare to be surprised!
Brace yourself!
Ohhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is easily the greatest video game trailer I have ever seen
What a game 😍
Kevin Sorbo as thor?
Yes.
I'm glad that they included a variety of enemies this time.
Hold on hold on  No release date ☹️☹️☹️
I lost my voice screaming at this trailer reveal 😂😂 The previous game is my favorite of all time and I’m excited to see what they’re going to do with Atreus’s now.
game of the year already
This looks just like DLC...
AfroAsgardian girl?🤔
SEÑORES HOY SALE KRATOS EN FORTNITE
Ps....5? 😐
Let's go baby another round getting drunk when he says boy!!
Can't wait to play on my series s
Vai ser ÉPICO!
Feel like they gona contracting another pantheon
Ready to place my pre order for the Deluxe Edition.
Why is Thor's voice familiar?
I have been waiting for a actual trailer
This looks well on the way to completion and is a cross-gen release (for the moment) so I’m going to guess 🤔 November 2022, place your bets…winner gets cookie 🍪
Only PS5?????
Best game ever GOTY again!
*coming to PlayStation consoles
Ragnarok is coming no matter what  you can't stop it Atrues neather can Sony
Nicee
I’m to gassed for this gameeeeeee
TYR AKA SIGURD
that 0:10 is telling something, atreus with horns... loki...
Hype🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
the ps4 is holding this game back hard! this looks no different from the ps4 one...sigh..what can you do
Wait is that calliope? 3:04
Бляяяя,наконец-то! Теперь жду ещё больше!
Yeah he’s a teen but he is still behaving like a boy
That girl at the end is giving me Hero Girl from The Polar Express vibes.
If you want to see Twitch chat's Reaction.
That voice drop.  You’ve grown, boy.
Atreus: “stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general”  Kratos: “Boy.. you are treading on some mighty thin ice here”
2:34 Loki's powers!
Xbox fans punching the air right now
Literally looks like dlc
Bye bye cory.. Wait... where is the World serpent?
I want it noooooooow!!!!😳😳😳
LET'S FREAKING GO, HYPE IS REAL
I swear....Playstation always gets the best games PC and Xbox on the other han,ugh :/ I really envy PS Fanboys.
It's sad because Cory Barlog is not the director but anyway let see what happened.....to be honest i dont believe this game come in the GOTY category
Chill booooy
i am not impressed
E a data .?
This game is gonna be contestant for 2022 game of the year
Atreus with the deer antlers at the beginning is perfect foreshadowing.
Crazy excited for this 🔥🔥
no date The same engine from 2018 The same but more "polished" It will come out for PS4 I want to believe that Santa Monica will impress us, but I am afraid that it will not be so
Man this is my most anticipated game next to Final Fantasy 16. The wait will definitely be worth it
How come nobody is talking about how tall tyr is?
85 dislike Xbox 😂😂😂
trash show
Looks like an expansion. Why release a seperate game?
Omfg I was all on board until the tokenism at the end  Why? Why the diversity in Norse mythology….  You are pandering wankers
bravo😱😍
HUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why did they make Angrboda black?
Tyr with 2 arms
Looks like PlayStation 5 exclusive 😁
Calling it now.  Game of the Year.
Esta parte da minha vida... Esta pequena parte da minha vida... Chama-se felicidade.
Give me Spider of War!!!
A sigh of relief when I saw mimir hanging from his side
Tyr 😍😍😍😍 it’s a giant and have his two arms
This game made me love snow !!!  💙💙
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Tyr still has both hands watch for Fenrir
Typical black nordic girl.

Couldn't let the Matrix out do them I see.
Let's gooooo!!!!! Finally Santa Monica studios 🤜🤛

Atreus is so old now..
AAAH MI PIXULA
Atreus grew up like 5 inches 🤪
More blood and gore plssss
“You’ll get your answers soon enough…well some of them :) “ Y’ALL PLAYING WITH US 😭😭😭
Tyr looks like Kratos
😍
Cory Barlog didnt direct this one. I think they wanted to make it politically correct and he didnt.
Only ps5?
I'm so happy we can move between platforms freely now. Climbing was so time consuming in the previous game
Who is the men in the final trailer?.Jisús? Viva cristo Rey💪🏼
Это просто ОХРЕНЕННО 👍👍👍
Can't wait!!!!  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing!!!

Not gonna lie but I got teary when I saw Kratos..
This trailer is better than 2021
2:18 That's how playstation shut xbox fanboys today.
Kratos can't call atreus *BOYY* anymore, he has to call him Teen
Nice

Chills. Literal chills
BOY

Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Let's Go !! Ragnarok Awaits
Kartos didn't say "BOY" once in the trailer! If we don't hear a single "BOY! in the game we will all be disapointed!
There better be no color coded enemies
I love this game 10/10
Available for ps4?

Cool.
Cookie 🍪

The description says 2022. Sony leaked the date you guys
TRASH trailler
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Boiiiiiiiii is back 😍🔥
Can’t wait to watch this on YouTube cause ps5 are still hard to get.
In brazil play has limites, the price of a playstation, an ps1 are costing 800 reais, 153,90 Dolars, like cheap but it dosen´t its like more than a half of a minimum wage soo, play HAS LIMITS
Musieli murzyna wcisnąć buhahahaha
Soo glad i have PS5 now😍😍😍
Cory barlog aint directing bro am scared now
Why you note not a release date?
I just want to record that I was here at the trailer launch at 18:19 (or 18:20) and I'm honored to be here, and yes, I'm going to get pre-sales on this game. So 2023, wait for me
Best thing that happend to me this year, thank you Sony🤝
On ps4 too?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Me dejaron bien cagado
Sad to see this game looks like PS4 game
Boy
I’m sorry but I’m so hype to see a accurate representation of Thor and I know for a fact he’s going to be my favourite part of the game.
A descrição diz que o jogo está para 2022, que assim seja feita a vontade da Sony!!!
Please make it for the ps4 as well
Tá que o pariu 💪
I legit yelled “YES” as soon as I saw Kratos.
Finally we get a new feature: people!

UNBELIEVABLE 😍😍😍
3:04 Vanaheim Realm?
Sony won AGAIN!
LESSSSZGOO
DAY ONE WE THERE! So hype for this!!
Guess Freya is still mad.
Ragnarok is coming 🥶🥶
Que?
Probably autumn of 2022 or early 2023 I would guess
THE BOI HAS BECOME A YOUNG MAN!
Game: Atreus is a teenager now. Kratos idc he’s still a BOI
Nice silhouette of Atreus, foreshadowing, as he comes with the deer on his back and its horns forming Loki's horns. Can't wait to see this game
So Atreus is gonna be even more annoying now
A RELEASE DATE PLZ???????????
New director makes things difficult
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥أخيرآ🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where is a datee
New objective: Stay alive until this game’s release
They did not put a date that worries me
*KRATOS IS LEGENDARY!!!! RESPECT FROM BRAZIL 🔥🔥🔥🔥*
This is  what we were all waiting for?!
Too bad i still don't own a PS5 and won't till 2023 because of the shortage, can you do something about that Sony??????
Not BOI anymore
لە کۆتایدا 🔥
Yessssssss
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I LOVE IT ❤❤❤❤❤
Goose bumps all over my body, when the melody starts !!!!!
Hype!
Only ps5?
We are not worthy. Day 1 / Platinum for sure
Is that Tom Holland?
I hope it dont have g*y    I hope
Damnit I gotta get a PlayStation. Forget an Xbox
Это просто шедевр! Теперь нужно ждать дату выхода!!!
GOTY
Imagine Atreus being called “TEEN!” Instead of boy
When?

Finally he fed us!
We'll get the release date after Ragnarok happens in real life
Jajja el pepe
One word : Epic.
About time Santa Monica, About time 🥺
Atreus came from the direction of the deer.
Thor's visit vision is updated with Atreus being a teenager, cooooooool

AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
Snake’s not the only dog musher
New voice actor or puberty?
This is what i was wating for
OMFG!!!!
This and Insomniac saved the PlayStation showcase
TBH I am disappointed with the trailer.....it doesn't feel like anything different from previous game.
i dont care if the gameplay is the same as GoW 2018, " it ain't broke, don't fix it"
Atreus se parece a Benito de vecinos
Too much the same. Like a DLC
Dad of war 2: Puberty
This Is Gonna Be Crazy
*falls down in the ground just like the breaking bad guy*
This looks amazing! 🔥
RYAN HURST AS THOR! PERFECT!
Looks amazing, can’t wait to play this!!
Please let this game Come out on ps4
That girl at the end is also a giant.
Como me alegro que las Hojas del Caos tengan más usos y que el juego tenga mas verticalidad, pero no se si se puede saltar o no XD   I miss jumping
Kratos: BOOOYY come here.. Loki: you mean teen  Kratos: 😐 🪓 Loki: Alright chill bruh chill Kratos: HMMM...
Can't wait!! 😍🥰
Corey barlog is not directing the game
👍
TELL ME WHEN YOU COWARDS
AND YOUR 2022 GAME OF THE YEAR IS...
Atreus' design is great although the hair needs a new do.
Yeppp😂🖤!
I wonder who the lady at the end is suppose to be? Either way this looks awesome
Where is jorm bro?
Tyr is alive, he is massive and tall, while our BOY has grown up, I'm gently touched.
Kratos: You are still not ready Boy  Atreus: Then when will I be?  Kratos: When Santa Monica releases your spin off sequel series.
So u guys are all gonna buy this expansion for $69?
Yeeeeeessss please
:)
I love The Travel Animation from Asgard to Midgard at 2:12.
Loving the development of their dynamic!
Finally
Hypeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Kratos deserves a peaceful exile or the most epic death in PS history.
RIP PS4
Kratos: The birds...the bees...they do not know what pleasure is, boy. Close your heart to them. And do not watch the off-camera quick time events from my past.
PERU like
Release date might as well be 2024 with the shortages
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and  start thinking like a geanral , best line
Kratos:boi Atreus:duuude
Nrx
LETS GOOO
According to the director Thor,Odin will be there in game
1:06 Thor finally went for the head
AHHHH

There goes my Gold Armour that took me 50 hrs to get
Cuando sale ? Fecha
Llamen al papa de los vírgenes quenk!!!
I'm Hyped for this!!!! 😍😍😍
Omfggggg no comment 😱
Watch your tone teennn
Can't wait to fight my man Opie :)
Looks just like gow 2018 but its completely fine. Means they can focus more on making a bigger game rather than trying to go for an evolution on graphics.
THIS IS IT!!!🔥
é o jogo mais porrada da Playstation namoral...
Xbox : "I am sorry " Playstation: "Don't be sorry be better "
2:09 Thor: You wont see the end of this day Kratos: Its my thing... little hammer
Is that Josh Brolin voicing Thor? Sounds very much like him.
I'm ready to rewatch this trailer over and over again!
Ora kulos
I waiting this game in all time
The Hands Of Thor Could Not Defeat Me, The Queen of Valkyrie Could Not Hold Me And You Odin Will Not Live To See The End Of This Day! I will have my Son
Looks the same
عاشووووو
😍😍😍
ps4?
Looks incredible!
The guy from Fortnite is getting a game! Yes!!!!!
Umm who’s the girl supposed be at the end
Simply incredible and I will be able to enjoy it on my ps4.
😍😭😭😭😭💙
Quiet TEEN
Not impressed with Combat system🤦🏽‍♂️plus I wish they could take it back when the game was really brutal💯honestly
Oh look, you can upgrade the shield🤔
...and they went woke. I assume the character that girl was used to be a redhead.
My favorite game series returns! Time to save money for a PlayStation 5!
B O Y
Finally the time has come!
So when does this launch? Q2 2022?
Looks like DLC of the last game
K🤩🤩😍😜😍
Is this gta 6?
😍
The cinematic music is next level. Very impressive. This game looks great. AGAIN!
Vai sair só pra ps5?? Alguém pode me fala ai

😍
“Come here TEEN”
I was living for this moment!
Will come on ps4...?
Eric said a little bit too much in his interview, next time boys don't say too much
I am waiting...
Kratos is so used to Freya trying to kill him he doesn't even look surprised
😍😍😍
So exited!!!!!
When is this available to pre order on the ps5 store?
Seeing Kratos in a new GOW game: Happiness
WOOOOOOOO
BOY!!!!!!
BOY
I've heard of it
🔥🔥😍
ممنون
This looks incredible
Thor: You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Kratos: Bruh
oh man i can’t sleep tonight with excitement!!
I’m going to be fan in a HUGE fan girl moment when this comes out
Ragnarok is coming.
Will this only be on ps5
Finally I can watch this in 4k
Shut up and take my money!
What does the monkey do in a ancient Scandinavia?
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYYY !!
Boi and dad is back
surprised this game is the final one for the Norse   I was expecting a trilogy for sure
The graphic look exactly like the cinematic trailer from three years ago ,WOW😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Ateus: “Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a general”  Kratos: “NO, BOY!!!!”  Ateus: “I’m not a boy, not anymore”
2:11 STRAIGHT OUTTA ASGARD
-"Stop thinking like a father" -No 😤
"Read it, boy..."
Not even 60 frames per second, why?
Xbox: I fear no man, But that thing…………….  *Playstation: Drops this Leviathan*  Xbox: It scares me
yeaaaaaaaaaahhh
Wow Wow WOOOOOOOOW it's very very very very  nice
Yesssssss chaos blades back baby
They shouldn't have shown us tair in the trailer but im so ready for this
*I was going through a lot when this game released* and hated it - - didn’t touch it until boredom struck in the pandemic - - played this and RDR 2 and they’re some of the best games I played on the PS4.
Graphics are phenomenal
So this is the end of the Norse mythology series, while I find that kinda sad I also can’t wait to visit othe mythologies like Chinese and Egyptian mythology
Lived up to my hype and more🔥
Nice dlc.
Boring
LETSS GOOOOOOOOO!
YASSSSSSSSSSS
Two gods of war. 😥 freya still hates us.
ΩPrepare yourself for stopping RAGNAROKΩ HA HA HA It will answer for those people said that XBOX is better than US😈
Finally!!!
Boy !!!
I'm gonna need a bigger T.V.
The real war is raising a teenage boy
Tyr!!!!!
Kratos: Now boy, when a man loves a woman very much, they do what's called a "QuickTime event"👌🏾
Will might be the best game of the year
IM BEAR
IM ABOUT TO
Boy is time to end this.
Looks she finally got her fighting spirit back
THE BEST CONSOLE EVER!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I thought you would be bigger" after I saw Tyr now I understand
please dont kill Kratos!!!
Não vai ter pra PS4 :(
I'm expecting this to hit 1 mil by the end of tomorrow...
Let’s go……!!!
Tyr is huge af.
NO WORDS. 10/10
Boi
Thanks Sony
Wait. Not on ps4???
My friends, the most awaited moment has finally arrived!!!
Boy
Increibleeeeeeeee
Hey you from the future! GoW Ragnarök is coming out the next days and you want to hype yourself up again, right?
Se sabe si habra version para ps4???
QUE DELICIAAAAAAAAAAA
i'm against being hyped for games but i just can't help not being hyped
TYR !!! O.o
I LOVE YOUUUUUU
Eeeeeveryone here for this. Gave my goosebumps goosebumps.
this is already amazing
Kratos looking fire with his new outfit
Lol I’m skeptical. But everyone is sucking this game off already .
Few times I've become bored and uninterested so fast. One was when that Firaxes capeshit game was announced to be card-based. The previous GoW was the most disappointing game I'd ever played (and I played No Man's Sky on release) because the fanboys hyped it up to be some 50/10 game. It's 7/10. You're all deluded.
My wallet is about to be empty when this comes out
Siuuu
2045?
Mimir has a mini bookstand! Love it. Honestly there are no words to describe how excited I am, just have to wait patiently for it and for Elden ring ofc ✨
Lol niga
Waiting it for xbox 💥💥💥😈😈
Yesssssssss
MASTERPIECE COMING!! ⭐🔥
2 gods of War in one land 🔥🔥
Here's the GOTY
Hellyeah lets gooo boys !!!!
The fact it’s coming to PS4 also is what I’m excited about I can actually play it next year.
This looks sick Atreus is grown up
This is the best game of world
Kratos shows up and makes the whole Xbox line up irrelevant
release date...?? We need answers
The moment Mimir poped up I lost it.
Someone put me into fckin coma till this game comes out pleaseee
No release date, that means we will have to wait at least until 2023
So if this game is the end to the Norse saga, what will be next?
One of the best trailers ever, they got gameplay and cinematics mixed perfectly
This is literally a copy and paste of the last game, what a joke.
👀👀
GOW 1.5
Looks like *boy* is going to be more annoying lol
Exciting times ahead! Hope everyone stays safe until this game comes out😊
I have never been more hyped for anything...even Infinity War.
Ba a estar bueno
😂😂😂Rockstar 😂😂😂
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! ☝🏻☝🏻
Omfg yez
4k Wow 🔥👑sony👑🔥
This showcase would have saved e3
Finally the wait is over now❤️🔥
AHHHHHH ÉPICO 💙🇧🇷
Im cryin... THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
When I saw the trailer in the showcase, it looked so unrealistic for me. Seeing Tyr, and Freya fighting with Kratos was really strange for me. And of course the fat Thor!!! But I really liked that some creatures looked like the greeks ones. This is going to be very epic!!
Who else is waiting to get a PS5 when this game comes out?!
will it come out for PS4
He heard of it
Shut. Up. And. Take. My. Moneeeeeeeey
People have been asking for it.  Kratos: Then you shall receive it.
Can we all just appreciate the team at playstation and sony. They do it for us!
Did you watch cory's interview at the end of the showcase?? I think he is making a deadpool game
Finally guys ✓✓✓
Playstation: Games AAA Xbox: Teraflop
Game of the generation
Just what I was waiting for from tonight's showcase
Spring 2023?))
Damas y señores, esto es HYPE verdadero!
Lo mejor del PSshowcase !! <3
Nahhhhhhh I'm too hyped for this🔥🔥🔥🔥 Need to play previous games again to mentally prepare
Puberty hit Atreus hard.
Кайф
The girl at the end annoys me
GOTY...  THANKS SONY, WE LOVE GOW 💪🏻💪🏻
BOI IS NOW BIG BOI
this is something different on an oled tv with the ps5. i cant wait. only bloodborne 2 would have dominated this
Sony clapped xboxers cheeks again.
So does this mean we can’t call him “BOOYY” anymore?? He’s growing up so fast and becoming a man! 🤣🤣
this is amazing BOY
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Something about Kratos's doesn't look right
I will cry, I just loved it so much 😭😭😭😭😭
GOTY 2022
nies😃
Nice 😊👍
Naze
amazing.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
OH BOI!!!
Can't wait....
Rip xbox
Tyr is BACK !!!!!
Bring me Thor
Seeing Tyr was the most epic thing ever
Imagine how beautiful this game could be if it is not also on ps4
