v11?  v3 at my my gym lol.
0:08 lol this one is the GTAV Los Santos skyline.
This really shows how little the grades can mean. Struggling on the v4 and then flashing the v6 is honestly really encouraging to me
Are there peer-reviewed papers on the effectiveness of chalk versus no chalk? If not, he is a good geek… you won’t do anything for which there is no scientific evidence. It doesn’t matter if everyone does it, it doesn’t matter if it FEELS like it helps — you need to KNOW that it does. That’s what makes him a geek. And Magnus not questioning the use of chalk is exactly what makes him not a geek.
I knew Geek climber when he climbed V2 haha bro forgot about who was there when he had nothing though.
Magnus for others: Brushes diligently Magnus for self: Shirt Whip
Interesting how, now, Geek Climber is no longer a really big climbing channel on yt...
I started following recently that’s true that the content is a bit nerdy 🤓 but I love the fact he doesn’t give up easily
I know this is an old video but if you ever come to Michigan check out Scrapyard Climbing. I will let you climb shirtless for the video
This makes me think UK gyms are sandbagged af, or these are weak af.
the nail ASMR at 17:20 is DIABOLICAL
no link to his video, just his channel...
24:04 someone fell from a V10
Great video I started clearing my V4’s recently after climbing six months.😊
*laughs at Sender One*
I’ve been really engaged with Magnus and his videos recently. He is such a genuine and kind man. It’s so refreshing and amazing to watch. So talented and impressive what he does. Very patient and willing to help anyone no matter who they are. Hats off to him and his channel
Gym is called Sun Country Goods
9:39 thats because, if i remember correctly the ring finger has testosterone receptors in it, and because of it usually for males the ring finger is longer than the index, and for women, it is usually the other way (also for girls with brothers and other stuff can manipulate it, but this is how it is most of the time)
Great vid! American gyms always seem very soft
FYI there 9:45 there is a link between athletic ability and the length of you ring finger. Its called the 2D:4D ratio. might be why you were at the top of your spport
Magnus stop rating the gyms on the music. Thats not relevant to anyone who’s not a YouTuber. Anyway great review.
17:20 was that for Adam? be real
2:38 Geek: "I don't use chalk" Magnus: "Im Chalked"  LOL I know he said shocked, but it sounded similar to chalked to me
Geek Climber vs Chad Climber
Sorry but that wasn't a scientific experiment. You gave him chalk but also removed your shirt, enveloping him in your aura. We can't know which one resulted in his improvement.
magnus' forearms are massive
Jay jay has a cute smile! :3
Those grades at that gym are definitely higher than they should be lmao
haha I love that gym!
My home gym has difficult grades and I much prefer that over soft grading.  That first V4 climb you did would be a V2, maybe even V1 in my gym
Awesome!! Love it.
15:02 16:37 loool hilarious
quadless video :(
I'm quite happy for the comparison of the finger length, so I now know which are my two strong fingers to use at two-finger-holds. Thanks Magnus for making those great climbing vids!
so does "flashing" mean doing it on the first try..?
Wait a min, this is the same guy that tried learning handstand in 150 days
The venn diagram of climbers and software engineers is a circle
Magnus short-circuited when he heard he (G.C.) never learned to use chalk.
That had to be the softest V6 I have ever seen.
The one thing I don't like about this video is its kinda minimize how American climbing is for people from friend country have no idea so why not put a great American gym climber on instead of how many views this nerds got lol
This gym is going to cause some rage quitting when people try to climb outside or at a gym with grades based in reality. I know it's not uncommon, but this gym really takes it too far. What a joke
I love indoor climbing after a long day or week because on the wall the only thing that occupies my mind is my fear of heights and not fear. I also like the feeling of being isolated as i work my way to the top then the sound of clapping from below when i get to the top shatters that feeling.
Hahahha I wonder how many people looked at their middle three fingers when talking about the two fingers used in gripping😂
He seems SOOO SWEET OMG😭
I have a man crush on you Magnus 🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤘
Go to lab(la boulder) it's better
This was so feel good!
Watching this today and hearing Magnus say “not a good coach” while he has bouldering blueprint out this week is insane growth. Happy to see how far you’ve come.
18:41 The problem is that you don't get a sense of the slope when the camera is facing the wall directly. That's what makes the difficulty deceiving. If it were just a flat wall it definitely would be much easier, but your hanging under the wall for many of these holds.
Jqson you need to use chalk, besides you're already using chalks because other climbers leave chalks on the walls.
that was honestly my fav gym back in la
maileware
I can’t get over his gums being the same size of his teeth
He seems like such a nice guy, I hope you make another video with him!
When the man who bathes in chalk meets the man who does not use chalk 😂
I’m a touchstone member in the Bay Area and I’m planning to check out all SoCal touchstone gyms this weekend 😅
My guys said chalk Makes no difference 💀💀 Man’s “Geeked out”
At 2:40 Magnus says I'm chalked and it was one of the best climbing "nerd"/dad puns I've ever heard XD
I thought he was climbing with Terrence Tao when I saw the thumbnail 😂
bro he played the mark rober theme when climbing v11
"Im chalked" 2:39
This man flashed a 7a without chalk?! I look forward to seeing him compete in the 2024 Olympics now that Magnus has shown him the way
I normally climb around v2 and can sometimes hit a v3. Those V2s looked insanely way but then the first v4 looked like a pretty big jump from them, but it's in my favorite style, so immediately I wished I could climb it.   I noticed a lot of gyms don't know how to set for lower problems. Part of me wonders is it because they're more used to the higher grades?
jeez man, what cameras do you use?! lol
Magnus, please come to beijing, the gyms here are hard. I climb v6 in the US, but V4 in China.
Chalk.
👌
Magnus has an amazing physique even for people that lift weights
impressive that he’s climbed v6’s without chalk. that’s essentially v8
Good skills
The collab that nobody asked but everybody needed
Rate gyms in Amsterdam!! loved this video
“I never use chalk” Magnus: (literally) “you call yourself the Geek Climber, and you never figured that out?”  Lmaoooo
"Or flash it" 😂
Buenas, soy de Cuba y estoy empezando en el climbing, el canal de Magnus es el primero al que me suscribí por lo bien hechos que están los video, disfruto mucho viéndolos. Saludos desde Cuba
I think once you start climbing with chalk you can't climb without it. It's like your skin forgets how to stick to the holds
Magnus eyes pupil is so good love that
How is being soft on grading a positive point when grading the gym? 😅
9:15 that seen 🤣🤣🤣
Bro Magnus makes it look so easy lol.
"chalk is all you need"
20:59 woah that guy in the tank top behind looks so buff and sexy
If Youre ever in southern California. Come to aesthetic climbing gym in lake forest! Great gym and community. They also really take care and clean their holds very well!
You guys always visit the huge gyms in the huge cities (exception to that small one in Tokyo).  Would love to see you visit some small town gyms and see what you think. I don't know about other countries but in USA they are popping up everywhere, like those McKarate places in the 80s. Even my one horse town has one now.  (I say horse but it's really more of a half-crippled mule.)  NGL though, I wish they were around when I was a kid. I used to climb everything as a kid... trees, fences, jungle gyms, construction sites... at least until it became "socially unacceptable", not that it was *ever* acceptable as a girl. Tldr I wish I'd known this sport existed, now I'm too old, lel.
When I think of LA I think of homelessness, corruption and ignorance.
What does ‘does it have volume’ mean?
so easy to see a pro against a noob
Geek is very wholesome, Magnus finds a way to bring the best out of eveyrone
Very good!
20:20 Chris Ramsay's song
"I am a Software Engineer and Geek and climber often don't go together" bitch I am a dev and my entire team is bouldering :D It's like the most IT sport from my personal experience. Great video though. I think this dude is the best I could achieve physically if I also got into climbing more.
It was super fun climbing with you, Magnus! Thanks again for the collab, and thanks for showing me the power of chalk 😆!
This video is a 4.9. Could be perfect, but it's missing something.   What's it missing?  I don't know, but since I gave it a 4.9, it surely must be missing something, otherwise I would have given it a 5.  So it is lacking––or so it seems.  But what would you rate this comment?
doinkin ur highness
Eh sorry man this is not the best in LA. Check out Sender One gym next to the airport :)
Thanks to Geek Climber for showing how difficult it actually is, because it actually does look easy when Magnus does it.
no chalk is wild lol
my jaw dropped when he jumped off the topout wall. I go to Hollywood boulders and even topping out scares the crap outta me haha
i kind of want to see magnus go to singapore lol it's a small but pretty nice climbing scene here :))
When climbing routes in a gym, are you supposed to only use the same color holds for both your hands and feet?
Another killer video, Geek Climber is cool as hell, so I'm not so sure why he calls himself "Geek Climber", but I'll go with it only because he does.  Magnus, thank you for sharing your world with us all, for someone like myself that is absolutely terrified of heights and is waay too big of a guy and now actually physically unable to rock climb due to injuries, I can somewhat live your world through your videos, and I appreciate it like you can't even imagine, thank you so much for all your work!
As a dancer and an artist who also loves anything physical, I can appreciate his non-thought, intuitive approach to climbing.  The strength and beauty of his body as he dances his way up those walls is a thing to behold!
That guy is super nice and positive.
17:20 Oh the climbing holds asmr!!!!
15:00 my mans' lat spreading while resting
@17:20 some unnecessary foley.
Looks like a really good gym with lots of variety and well supplied workout area but the grades of the routes shown here look very soft imo. At the bouldering gyms I've visited, that yellow V8 would be a 5, maybe a softer 6 tops.   Also surprised Geek doesn't use chalk. I've never understood climbers who say they don't need chalk. In my experience, its a nightmare trying to climb routes after such people as they leave the holds all sweaty for everyone else. This is particularly problematic for tougher routes with slighter holds. Just use chalk, guy! You'll climb better.
The little tips you learn without him trying to teach are the best, 9:40 in the level finger/ stronger finger tip, tried it today and it’s so much better for me not to use my index finger it’s a game changer, save loads of little tips like that and make a video of it
Dumb question: Do they ever clean the chalk and dust from the walls and floors every now and then? And if so, how do they do it? Pressirized water beam all over or...?
I have a membership here, great gym!
I know Magnus makes climbing look extremely easy, but this has to be the softest gym I've ever seen. I thought my local gym was soft after climbing outside, but I've seen V4s and V5s in my gym that are harder than the V7 Magnus climbed here.
I don't want to take way from the skill of these guys and what they're doing but those routes are rated extremely soft.
I've been there! It's a pretty fun gym
I would like to See a collabo Video with Will Tennyson.same Video Style,Content (Fitness/Food/Diet and Experiments like Training with swat or try climbing as Part of a „Train and live like the Aquaman Actor vs climbing and Sports and Experiment content From Magnus)Both very Funny and Sympathic.Both 1,5M Followers on YouTube. I think they Both can have a good Time and Share Their Followers with Each other :) maybe will Will Start climbing(he loved it when he tried) and Magnus Will spent More Time in the gym 😊keep going Magnus.i Follow you since 200000 Followers.
great video. had my feeling good about life. love all the support and positivity
Someday I’m going to visit Norway and climb at your gym. Life goals! Love the content!
You should try Elevation Bouldering gym in Eugene Oregon! They have great setting!
Nord vpn is fast when it Happens to work. Currently caught behind the great wall of China. I can only recommend to get another vpn nord doesn’t work at all
Dude your a monster of a climber.
Just something to think about……not everyone produces oil on their hands.   I work in maintenance now for 18 years, construction for 16 year before.    My hands are heavily callused.     Here’s my thought, bare with me,   I can change halogen bulbs with bare hands with 0 issues.  I don’t have oil or sweat on my hands.  If you have oil on your fingers it will burst the glass bulb due to the heat intensified due to the oil.     Maybe the same with climbing and chalk.
Look at the gums on that dude, yoiks...
16:45 im dying xD lmaoo for real tho
I wanna try climbing but im a 6’4 340ib gorilla. Idk how well thatd work out😂
Love watching, you make yourself look weightless when you climb, but what is meant by "flashing" a climb please?
Geek climber got the gay finger length ratio
Chalk... but what about shirt?!!
B9 looked like an alien landscape, I love it
Magnus transitions with a bit of spring.
If you are ever in Florida you should come to Vertical Ventures in St. Pete, FL
did that dude get a gum transplant?
Possibly the ugliest city in the US.
magnus is my favorite climber on youtube and he has me wanting to start climbing but seeing him climb with other experienced/professional climbers is always a great video
Love the energy in this one. It’s just nice to see passionate people working together
Are his shoes uncomfortably tight? Is that why he seems to take them off after each climb?
comment
You guys are amazing! Great collaboration 🎊 🎉😢
Magnus is such a chalk dealer! Hooking Geek Climber up with that shizz!
it seems like touchstone gyms are consistently highly rated. i recently started climbing and started at a touchstone gym and i didn’t know how nice i’ve had it
when i think of LA I think of gambling and crimes
Asi me gusta, sin magnesio. Yo tampoco lo uso jajaja
Summary: Two cool dudes 🦾👏
Loooove this
where you can climb shirtless lOLLL
I’m not voting
LA the best
I also dont use chalk because my hands dont sweat. My feet do though so i wear socks with my climbing shoes.
You should try Camp5 climbing gym at 1Utama shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is amazing!
Magnus on the V6: "yeah you could just jump to those holds." The geek climber: just uses his lanky ass legs to spider climb it
Some people have more sweatier hands
Is that the @MarkRober theme music playing at 20:12? This feels like a 3way crossover episode now :D
yo, Derek films Jason too? I thought he only filmed for Brandon William. he appears at 2:07
That thing with the finger length is interestingXD On my  left hand my index finger is longer and on my right hand the ring finger is longer.
I loved his enthusiasm around you. it definitely has to be weird for magnus to have someone so amazed and encouraged by just being around him.
i love how happy geek climber is
a pair of pants per video lol
17:20 naaah this ain't it see y'all amma dip
for some reason id really like an outdoor video with stasa gejo
Just like everything else in Hollywood, everything is exaggerated and fake.
Awesome video as usual, Magnus. So glad I found this channel a few years back..
How is it possible that even in my German hometown of < 1 million people each climbing gym has at least 500 ratings and you visit 4 or even 20 million people cities and they all have like 270 ratings on google..?
Geekclimber seems like a good dude.  Good vibes from that guy.
commenting for the algorithm
Don't understand  why everyone in the gym isn't just watching you climb.
Anti-maleware, even vpn is feminist!
every time i see these videos it reminds me of when i used to climb trees
Damn, I wished I wasn’t fat. 😂
Dope this is my gym 💪🏿 🧗🏿‍♂️
Nice, this is my home gym
bro is magnus wearing jeans? this man is a demon
No chalk? Its not a bad thing to use it. It helps to not have sweater hands
Mad respect to Magnus but this just gave me a perspective on what a monster Alex Honnold is. Alex is on a different league of his own. Fun to watch you both on this collab.
I love your cinematic shots
Chalk isn't about absorbing sweat, it increases the friction of your hands when coated with it. If it was about moisture, you wouldn't need to use chalk, you could use flour or starch. Chalk is better than flour because it has more friction
10:40 Beautiful climb
I wonder if when people say "i like this gym better, it's more my style" if it's just that the gym is softer so they're doing "better". A theory i've had after climbing at the most sandbagged gym in OC, and having people complain about it all the time lol.
Sick I work at this gym
Me and my friends did this gym a few months back, it was super fun. I am new to it though so I fell a lot lmao
Awesome colab
bruh the pun i'm chalked
Missed opportunity to see if geek climber climbs better without a shirt!
i love how he described geek climber as geek and climber typically dont go together cuz all the climbers i know personally have something to do with IT
the sauna there is the best part of the gym
am I the only Andrew Huberman fan that made the distinction of which one of them was more masculine
CHALK
“I’m chalked!” -Magnus 2:39
whenever youre in berlin, can you do something similar?
I was climbing at a place once, I’m not a normal climber man, watch out for me… I got a gnarly hand cramp lololol I’m not that good at all 😂
Im 6'3" 220lbs with a bad knee. But Magnus just makes climbing look fun, wish this was something I got into in my 20's.
Its not uncommon to chlimb without chalk, remember reading years ago scientifically its the same friction with/without and is more psychological.
Great vid! I also (most of the time) dont use chalk while climbing. My hands dont sweat so much and I find it that there is plenty of chalk on most holds on the wall. And most of the time that is enough
Lol, I’m dying over the chalk discussion! I feel useless without chalk!
Geek: "I don't use chalk" Magnus: "I'm chalked"
man I wished I was there, I told Magnus to lmk when he would visit LA or SF for bouldering but he didn't :( I feel so unimportant
Oh man, there is something SO satisfying about watching Magnus just lock into a crimp. Basically the whole climb starting at 7:14 / 7:20
Index finger longer then your ring finger is a sign of low-T within utero.
Maybe one day you can do the best climbing gyms in OC and San Diego
Magnus's reaction when Jason said he doesn't get sweaty hands: "I'm chalked"
Movies and famous people used to be what I think about first when I think of LA
2:39 He's chalked
this guy is cute , i like him
Really cool collab! Love to see both of you climbing!
Back when I climbed, I didn't use chalk because I couldn't stand the feel of it on my skin. It definitely would have helped me though!
17:20 the climbing asmr tho
I've just seen the first 3 minutes and I'm happy to see a climber who is not using chalk 'cause I also don't use it. I just don't sweat that much and I have a better grip without chalk. Everytime I tried to use chalk my hands slided off the holds :-)
Geek Climber is clearly the star of the show He's so wholesome!
Hi Magnus, new here. What does "flash" mean? Clime it first time?  CU
that setting looks SUPPPPPER soft lol
Pure narcissism!
@magnus you should go to Long Beach Rising near LA next time you are out here!
This was actually a very nice collab, because Magnus is definitely beyond most people watching him in terms of climbing skills but Magnus climbing with Geek, Geek being closer to most people's level and both of you talking about climbing/explaining why this route was better or worse than others makes it more understandable for us and also funnier for regular climbers since we don't feel like this is that 'out of range' for us. Really appreciated this video, great work Magnus, as always and Geek, you got yourself a new subscriber because you're very humble and nice to watch !
19:00 Geek climber is def above average
Sad there isn't more the vid is wholesome
I also rarely use chalk. It helps sometimes, but there were a few times I felt it made things worse, like trying to get dough to stick to a surface covered in flour
i understand not needing chalk as much if you do not sweat in your hands, but wouldn't it also add more friction than what human skin is capable?
geek: I don't use chalk magnus: I'm chalked
When I think of LA, I think of crowded, shitty, expensive, Mexican, and crime
Good video ,not been climbing for a long time and u make me miss it even more .feel so out of shape now though lol . If you ever in the Philippines it would be cool to get some refreshers off  of you .thanks for the renewed inspiration . 🧗‍♀️
i would love to see magnus do this type of video on some portugues climbing gym!!!!
Difference in finger length ratio is probably because Magnus was exposed to five times the womb testosterone as Geek.
magnus convincing jason to use chalk is exactly the same as someone peer pressuring someone else to start using heroin
Softest gym in the world?
Jason is all gums.
if you dont know how to explain "how you do it", its because u've learned in implicit way... that way make your knowledge more resilient and deep, but you can't explain/teach what someone should do
this proves climbing isn’t always about strength
Awesome vid!
17:21 that is one of the worst sounds I think I’ve ever heard lmao
Mans has got some serious gums on him 😂
What a cool Japanese guy he is!
i could do most of these if the wall was slanted the other way. maybe.
Thats one og the places i go climbing in la
Please don't go bigger in an attempt to outdo that video.  Views will come and go.  People's interests will come and go.  There is an authenticity to your videos that is not easily found elsewhere.
Magnus, you should do a video where you try some bodybuilding posses. Could be a fun video idea, there are tons of great youtubers who i am sure would love to collab with you on something like that, try it out!
HoBo was the gym I started at! Parking sucked and I don’t live in the area anymore, but I love the variety of wall types (overhangs, slabs, tunnels, corners, etc.)
17:20 good GOD no
Thank you!
12:29 - I NEED that Bob Ross cut-out!
Do you go to different gyms around the US often? I would just go to a gym and watch you climb for a couple of hours! Or a meet and greet <3
It's so cool that you were in my hood! Looking forward to visiting your gym early next year!
What a madman. I loved when the GC showed how difficult magnus made that one climb… couldn’t even get off the first hold
Thanks for the video
I go here all the time wish I ran into you man
For a geek it's very surprising he didn't think the chalk would make a difference.. it's all about that friction
Magnus sounds like me as a climber, and i haven't climbed a day in my life
LOL the t-shirt slap on the holds is a mood
I think it would be funny to see magnus midtbo climbing with magnus carlsen. Double magnus
both super humble guys, love your content magnus! ps. im a new ish viewer
I hate how LA doesn’t have many good auto belays. Like common   And only few gyms with ropes
Geek Climber reminds me of my dad. He too is a brilliant software-engineer and loves to climb.
2:39 "I don't have to use chalk when I climb"   "Wow, I'm schalked"
Magnus, you should come to Synergy Climbing gym in Chattanooga if you want to try the hardest boulders you've ever tried in a gym! They go up to about v13/v14 and are NOT soft!!!
This video really puts magnus's super human powers in perspective 👁️👁️✨
Epic Flash!
Geek just needs to build some more grip and upper body strength. Since he takes his time while climbing his muscles fatigue quicker leading to him losing grip. I’m not a climber but comparing him to magnus that seems like a correct assumption?
Magnus was ready to book a flight back to Norway after finding he didn't use chalk
Come to Flowstone is southern California! It's on the way to Joshua tree. The route setter set for the world cup in Utah. The problems are creative, hard, and get you thinkin!
Geek and climber don't typically go together?! I barely know any computer scientist, who doesn't climb. It's THE sport one associates with computer scientists.
What does that mean he doesn't sweat?! Does he have a gene defect or sth?
Newb here, what does a V6 flash mean?
About the finger lengths - keep in mind it also goes the other way too - both of you might have developed even more the fingers that you use more.
Min 18 wtf were those women's screams? omg seemed like a porn pop up came or something
When are you coming to Madrid? enough US !
2:38 Magnus ment to say: "I'm chalked"
I just drank moldy Gatorade.
"I don't sweat anymore" - Magnus ... "He's evolved!"
Hey new subscriber here! Caught my interest with your willingness to face military training in order to better yourself. I am trying to get in shape and stay motivated myself. However my brother, being a climber was psyched to find that we both are botnh entertained and educated by your channel. My brother is a rock climber in heart and training and as an outdoorsman in practice. I don’t know If I’ll be the first saying this, being as dangerous as rock climbing is when out in the real deal for fun,  I’m much happier and confident knowing that my brother watches your channel, and most of the videos on climbing. Please keep practicing and getting better!! My brother and others like him have a lot to learn from your persistence and heart. Coming from a state champion, I wish I could have faced more opponents with your zeal and ferociousness.  Wishing you the best. MC Chicago Suburbs
He’s the badass here but watching him with Alex free soloing shows you the level Alex is on hahaha
Outstanding balance !
“Geek climber” to be honest all the climbers that I knew at uni were phd Physicists (disclaimer I was a PhD Physicist as well so you can condition on that ;) )
Shocked to hear "best rated climbing gym in LA" and not see Sender One LAX!!! The place is gigantic, has both bouldering AND walls for top rope/lead climbing.   Magnus -- when you're back in SoCal I'll let you use my free monthly guest pass!
Absolutely love that man’s attitude! And of course love you Maggieboy 😂❤️
OMG, I could climb that V11 in my sleep, in fact that is the only way I could climb it, in my dreams. :)
I wanna hear what the route setters have to say about the softness of their routes.
Magnus finds joy in embarrassing other Youtube climbers lol.
Magnus turning kids into chalk........... ....."just try it...just a little bit"
You should try out movement in orange county. Amazing bouldering gym, state of the art workout area, and sauna in the locker room
9:15 any meme creators for those 20 seconds of pure gold content? 👌🤞😂
Magnus mix his chalk with cocaine so its adicting
“I climb with my shirt on and I don’t use chalk” Magnus stopped working for a second there
The only 2 climbing channels I watch (actually watched "Average Guy" who is now "Geek Climber") collab together! This world has some good in it! 😍
More people need to try less or no chalk.
ggs 💪
The finger combination used for pocket holds also changes which tendons are being used.
you should come to Arizona and try out Phoenix Rock Gym!!
damn i missed magnus at one of my gyms 😂
American gyms seem to be veryyy soft with their grading. You should come to Sheffield, the climbing capital of the UK, there are like 7 climbing gyms here and a lot of famous outdoor bouldering and trad
Nice sound work on the V9 and above, the climbing sounds were very isolated from the background, pretty satisfying
16:06 yeah when the climbing coke hits different the first time :D
Geekend climber…
Magnus praising the chalk like a religion is amazing
Little guy
Is magnus still with his gf?
This is MY favorite gym!!
Chalk gives better grip, but at the same time it makes some holds less abrasive, which is actually one of its benefits.  I feel like my hands are less beat up if I use chalk compared to without.
2:23 anyone?😏
I've been watching geek climber for a while now. I'm so happy for this collab, you can see how much fun he had!
You might be surprised by how many climbers are so called geeks. Most of my climber friends are software engineers for some reason. It might be the problem solving aspect of climbing.
Classic Mangus.. finishes a v10.. okay now it’s *starting* to get hard lol.  Also Magnus you should do climbing with a fan video starting with yours truly. Hit me up if in Boston ! We’ve some bouldering gyms that are brutal. Plus I’ll take you to the best lead climbing gym. There’s caves and arches you’re gonna love it !
Magnus.. do you still do finger strength training at all or nothing too serious like before?
Someone else who climbs without chalk! I was beginning to think I was alone
Hey Magnus, I have an idea you should try out. I saw the channel Action Lab tried to climb a wall with some nano-tape on his hands. This kind of tape simulates the grip that gekkos have on their fingers! He's not a climber though, so I would love to see you try something like that. The human gekko!
you should make a video talking about your free solo
Hello geek climber its funny u said that geek and climb dont go together cuz for bouldering in Fontainebleau when climbing start it was a very geeky hoobie and all climber were super smart, quiet and discret like geek!! That's after when climbing becomme popular than all people (non geek) come in this activitie ;)  Have a good day !!
Your scoring makes no sense at all if you rate everything 5 out of 5. If you'd be a Michelin Guide employee, you would not rate each dish you eat in everything restaurants with 3 stars, would you? A 3 star restaurant is so unique, so special that Michelin says that it's worth to make the journey just to eat at such a restaurant. And your star ratings should be similar. You should only rate any climbing route with 5 stars if that route was so great that you'd get on a plane simply to climb that route again. So a 5 star route ought to be extremely rare. A 4 star route should mean that if you pass through a town with a 4 star route, no matter what happens you WILL stop just to climb that route. 3 star routes can be the most fun route in any climbing gym but even if you'd be sleeping in a hotel next door you wouldn't care if you would not climb that route. 2 stars for routes that are ok nothing special. 1 star for routes that disappoint.
Idk if that’s typical for American but in the gyms in LA and Las Vegas the boulders looked way too easy for their grades. The 7c there looks like a 7a where I live
Love all these collabs 🤩👏👍👍
i want to see at different gyms just picking a high spot and using any hold to see how fast you can climb to the top
"whenever I go to a new place, I always look up the best rated climbing gym there" types: Climbing Gym LA where you can climb shirtless hahahah Love Magnus' humor!
You should make a definitive video on climbing shoe cleaning 101
chalk conversion complete. congrats.
I see you like collab videos! You should reach out to Toby Segar from YouTube's Storror. Would make for a great video!!!!
nice
that v11 has weird holds
ngl those look so much easier than what their graded
This collaboration! I didn't expect it, so my eyes were surprised when I saw th thumbnail picture. Reading the comments below I agree with many of them! Great work, great content, stay alive and stay you. NICE!
haha 'geek climber'... my nerdiest friends are always into bouldering
I think it'd be cool to have a "guest book" for each problem in the gym, so visitors can comment ratings & give feedback. Would be interesting to know which ones are popular.
free solo?
lol magnus- “the fact that you don’t use chalk is fascinating- have you tried?” haha magnus.exe has stopped working
So nice production!! Mangus seem like a really good guy!!
2:35 We should get a geek climber and Alex Honnold collab. That'll get him sweating again
this dude energy is warming and nice to watch , nice collab Magnus , as always great video
I really enjoy the format of the video, climbing escalating grades and rating them was fun to watch. Do you think route setters typically include the gradient of the climb I  the grade? I find a lot of gyms tend to just go on the type of holds and ignore the gradient.
I came here because I follow Geek climber. Wonderful content!
Enter "my gym is way harder" quote.
Is the music on the v11 a clue that you're going to Collab with @markrober?!
It's interesting that my first thought was "a climbing YouTuber who can't climb" which make me reflect how distorting it is to see climbing through Magnus, I have no idea at all how good this guy is but I think a lot better than I believe
I've never climbed but how great it must be to have someone like Magnus coaching you.
v11 is Urban Plastix "Not Font" , love them
I love when Magnus tries out gyms and rates them, I think this series has potential even past the "Best/Worst rated climbing gym" and it'd be awesome to see him just kinda pass through an area and try out a gym so we can see the variety of routesetting styles people have.  Magnus, if you're ever passing through Central Illinois, maybe on your way down or up from Chicago if you ever go, I'd love a chance to show you my hometown's bouldering / sport climbing gyms and hear your rating on them.
Love this duo!
Ay yo my name is Jason does that make me a really good climber
your videos are addictive
19:53 mark rober is nearby
Those grades looked soooo soft!
chalk vs. no chalk, Magnus won and converted him
Doesn't look like a great gym to me, routesetting seems kinda lazy with very few volumes = diversity and that's by far the most important thing to me
2:30 he's built different
I would love to see you try boulderwelt in germany if you ever happen to be around
Hey Magnus! Singapore has the highest number/density of climbing gyms on the planet (700 square kilometres)! Should check out our bouldering scene one day perhaps ;)   Can always ping me if you ever visit!
I've certainly seen climbs higher than V12 in gyms before
This video had made me once again note that I miss the vlogs. Watching you travel and do your thing was a huge reason I started watching the channel. And though I still absolutely love your videos!! It's too... Polished? Sterile? Not sure what the word is but your trip across America would be such a great 5min a day video
It really made me happy that you did a collab w Geekclimber.  I loved seeing how happy he looked.
Damn, this video is great! Fun to see a collaboration!
Great collaboration to see! Thank you Magnus and Jason for making this happen! :)
Magnus is just jacked so he makes holding on to all those crazy holds look easy.
Am i the only one, who recognizes magnus great music taste? 😅
I'd like a "Edit with me" vid where it's just you editing your filmed content. Clearly a lot of effort goes into it.
Loving this collab so much! Been following you both for so long. Love how happy Jason is, grinning from ear to ear! You can tell how much he appreciates and admires Magnus. Love how patient Magnus is with climbers that aren’t the same calibre as he. Whole video is just so wholesome and feel good 😊
“It looks hard”   *FLASH*
Magnus’s mission in life is to convert people to chalk
Come to Wichita Kansas! We have a great climbing gym here!
What's the song at 20:03
Sorry bro but I could see all over your face how boring that video was. Sometimes it doesn’t always matter how many followers people have they are just boring. 😵 geekclimber you are a lovely guy I do IT also high level stuff meet many like you just don’t be so tense loosen up bro 😎 and for Christ sake use chalk hahahahaha
It's always interesting to see a "normal" (actually quite skilled) guy next to a top level one, regardless of the field. If you just watch the top level guys, they make everything look too easy, so the added perspective is really cool.
The both of you are showing us....Climbing is having fun. No stress factor, just relax and enjoy. Thanks
What was he going on about, no chalk. He must have watched Magnus`s video, all climbers use chalk
Stop wasting time. Search for Truth of life.
sometimes i wonder if he (or more climbing personalities!) will ever come to singapore and try something (:
09:38 - everyone watching this video is now looking at their own fingers :)
16:07 coughs on his first cigarette
Puts on chalk: flash V8  Takes off shirt: flash V10
Man said he don’t use no chalk 💀💀💀
Come on man, be honest. Hope was the energy bar? 😉
Magnus should try caving with @Caveman Hikes
Geek climber? More like Chad climber. Now that he's using chalk he'll be cracking that v9 in no time.
im not a climber, but the thing about the finger's length makes sense. as i uses my middle and ring finger for tennis to generate the most power.
Not sure how long you're in LA, but Boulderdash, Chatsworth was my home gym when I lived there. Much more legit on grades, and they have lead. Sender One is a must try of course
You be surprised how many stem majors are climbers. Problem solvers always love climbing. Goes hand in hand.
You should come to The Overlook in Atlanta, GA! I’ve been a member a for a while now, and they’ve got the best setting I’ve seen so far
Magnus! Nooooo you should have went to Stronghold! That’s where the real stuff happens
You should totally go climbing with Ludwig Ahgren. Hes a youtuber and streamer and has been super into rock climbing. hes local to LA as well!
Magnus I love you but the sound of you scratching the holds/wall before you start is like nails on a chalkboard.... quite literally.
love it  i dont use chalk either!
the power of chalk =)) great video guys!! so fun to watch!
Its all about the chalk!!!
really glad to see this collab!!!!
Would love to see you 2 hours south in San Diego! We have awesome climbing gyms here
That was so much fun to watch! great time watching you show up the Geek Climber
broooo the grades there were so soft what the heck the v8 would be like v4 in my gym
Perfect combination of channels
Great video, Magnus and Geek Climber. Come over to Sender One LAX right by the airport for some good rope routes!
That’s an impressive v6 flash ! Well done Geek !!
I've been taught that you're supposed to grab pockets with your middle and ring finger, because the tendons of the rwo are tightly connected & if you slip and the two are seperated, you're more likely to injure yourself. No idea if that's true, but yeah
magnus missed the chance to end the episode like geeek with these wierd but funny hand movements 😛wow, i didnt know geek didnt use chalk the whole i watched him. imagine what he can climb now with chalk and without shirt ;)
Everyone: 5 out of 5 Magnus 3.5 out of 5
Are people walking up to you in the gym like "woah it's Magnus"?
“V12, ¡ think that’s 8a+, that’s pretty tough…” - Magnus Mitbø
Great video 👌  geek climber is a legend
If you're still in town you should check out The Stronghold, too! Happy to give you a tour.
Im surprised you didnt slap him for not using chalk
LOL that moment he realises chalk is usefull AHAHAHAHAHAHA
As a climbing newbie im very grateful for this kind of content. Learning by watching and trying after in a boulder center. Also magnus u should visit munichs climbing gym with the 25-30meter towers. would be insane to see something like this on here cuz i tried them myself and i got up to 20meters and then the anxiety kicked in because i looked down x.x <3
Veeeery soft 😅
Geek Climber's cannot-be contained over excitedly happy smile makes it wholesome.
when are you coming to fontainebleau ?
Surprising you didn't go to Cliffs of Id! Same company, I believe its 4.9 stars, and nearly every time I'm there I see some famous climber like Alex Puccio or Ashima Shiraishi. Technically outside of city limits I think but next time you're in LA try visiting there as well
"It looks hard" does it first try
Why are there no more videos with Marte??
Im so weirded out by this guy. I dont watch his youtube but hes been climbing for ages I feel like Ive seen videos from him popping up in my feed for ages. But somehow his climbing technique is worse than some of my beginner friends. Maybe he does it on purpose since he gets more views if he seems like a beginner?
was here 3 years ago and did not like it. But seeing this shows that the routesetters have gained some experience because these routes already look better than the stuff i saw when i was there.
What is flash?
o my god..these boulders are so boring. in germany it‘s so different, every boulder is a problem and you have to think about the right solution..
geek climber: “I don’t use chalk” Mangus Meatboulder: “You what👁👄👁”
You can get me (a beginner) to join you to rate the easier ones haha
I'm psyched magnus is in LA, check out LA Boulder too!
Magnus looks like Handsome Squidward with that hair lmao
The first of your Gym Review videos I watched was the Japan one, it was so cool! These are always enjoyable.
I love your videos magnus, I hope one day I can climb with you
Great content brother! I’m getting into climbing! At 29 I’m a little late to the show
*Magnus takes off shirt* ALL STATS +100!
So garbge lol
gotta have chalk to soak up all the moisture and oils to maximize friction
google reviews are really getting in depth now
Hey Magnus! There is also a 4.7 rated gym near LAX called Sender One Climbing that I like to climb at, let me know if you want to climb there anytime soon  😄👍
Magnus (climbing with) is aid
If LA Boulders also has 4.8 stars but less total ratings, then it has a better rating overall 🧮  😉
Would love to see you come to Australia Magnus! Come check out Urban Climb West End. It’s got a great Boulder Area and it’s the best Top Rope and Lead gym in Queensland. Plus it’s Winter here and perfect climbing weather. The only downside to the gym is that it’s boiling in Summer but (not that I indulge) you’re allowed to climb shirtless so maybe it evens out.
This video makes me realise we sandbag climbs in Australia hard! Then again… it always looks easier from behind a screen
I was always told the two primary fingers for two finger pockets are ring and middle because they are on a direct line down your arm, whereas middle and index are not, thus less mechanically advantageous. This makes more sense than Magnus' claim that middle/ring are the two strongest. My index is definetly stronger than my ring.
@Magnus Midtbø this was a cool video, but I still can't believe you free solo'd, crazy!
That’s my home gym!!! So weird to see it here. As much as I love it for quick sessions, I’m surprised that it’s top ranked in LA. There are several much larger boulder halls here, my favorite being Cliffs of ID.
V6 hahaha!!! No way very 3 or easier
The mics capturing your nails crimping against the wall is a masterpiece and also torture.
Magnus not comprehending how someone climbs without chalk is so entertaining to watch.
Loving the Touchstone exposure! Best gyms.
staff there is not a 5 the only nice one is christina  the place is clean for sure but staff shit
Anyone else waiting on the Marte reaction video of soloing with Alex?
Magnus! Come to Salt Lake City! We have world class outdoor climbing and world class gyms, and see if you can get a hold of Chris Sharma while you're here!
There are not a lot of volumes in that gym
How tf is this guy just now realizing chalk is good?
setting there looks pedestrian, LA is trash
Magnus: "It looks Hard" Walks straight up the wall.
24:04 lmfao
Great vid but I wish you would have went to Sender or Cliffs of Id instead, much better gyms.
Magnus goes to California and only makes videos at Touchstone gyms haha
i am impressed by the fact that geek climber climbs v7/v8 and doesn't use chalk!
I liked seeing you climb with Jason. It really puts into perspective how much harder those climbs are than they seem. Plus he has an opposing energy to you that was entertaining for me to watch
Just a note on pocket technique - the reason to use middle and ring finger is not just finger length but also because of how it aligns your wrist, which affects your wrist and finger tendons. If you climb a lot of two finger pockets or pull very hard off pockets, you will be less likely to get soreness or injure due to misalignment if you use the middle/ring technique that Magnus uses. Conversely, you will feel more strain across the hand and through the wrist climbing with the geek climber index/middle technique. You can also feel something similar even more easily in one finger pockets - the middle finger is easier and feels better to hang than the index finger even though many people have a stronger index finger.
just got my first pair of climbing shoes and next piece of gear is rungne bag, hope theyre in stock
Alternative Title: I flex on LA climbing gym (Abs included) Ft. Geek Climber
nice
Magnus love the videos, would you see what boulder grade you can campus up to? Perhaps with Pete? 👀👀
Magnus! You need to try the Spot bouldering gym in Denver, Colorado. They have some hard boulders all the way upto V13 sometimes and it’s a really cool gym. I’m sure you’ll have a great time there
Magnus! Love seeing you rate a gym I have climbed at many times. I will put my two cents in though and say that Cliffs of Id is the superior touchstone gym to Hollywood Boulders. Much more spacious, and also has a lead wall as well as a more defined gym/class area. There is also Sender One near LAX that does not have as nice of a boulder area in my opinion but has the most impressive lead wall I have ever seen. ~20 meters (60ft) overhung and amazing. Anyhow, love your videos. Thank you for the great content.
If you ever make your way over to the east cost of the US you should check out the Bouldering  Project in Boston, MA.  It was an amazing gym when I visited and it's pretty big.  The staff was super friendly even when I walked in at 6am when they opened and the gym is well put together
13:22 What you mean? "Geek and climber" definitely go together! 😂
I liked this video. Geek climber is a champ.
i love you magnus im a huge fan unfortunately i was too nervous to say hi but im in the gray beanie
So great to see you get to check out some LA gyms!  I laughed when you said things feel soft at HB :)... yup :)
how can u call yourself geek climber and not use chalk that was hilarious, love the collabs!
you should check out my home gym I go to, its bouldering only, but its Movement Fountain Valley, it has 4.7 stars. If your still in Sothern California. They just added some competition problems and id love to see you complete them since I havnt seen anyone finish them yet.
17:20 click for pain
if I'm not mistaken, you use your middle and ring finger for 2 reasons. 1. these fingers are attached to the same tendon, so your muscles are better aligned if you climb with these fingers, thus make you stronger. 2. (more grim reason) if something goes wrong, you only injure 1 tendon instead of 2.
Magus I've been watching u for years. That being said I wish the best. May God bless u and those around u. I do want to here more about u and ur life. Stay humble.
The Cult of Chalk. Welcome Geek Climber.
Herlig stemning. Flott film!
would love to see you go to smaller, more old fashioned style gyms. maybe even a chromatic gym
Seeing these videos definitely puts in perspective how much harder the V1 and V2 boulders are at my gym than others! Those problems look like intro ladders in your reviews but for us those problems are often hard to read and quite challenging! I always wondered how beginners I see online progressed to higher grades so quickly
Love the collab, but a bit confused as to why this guy has a climbing channel but don't seem to know THAT much about climbing? Really appreciate how humble he is learning from Magnus tho.
Great video as always Magnus! The subtle editing and the way you handled the sound was pretty dope! From the loud gym atmosphere being controlled to the details of the holds creaking! 🤯 mind blown!
You might think Magnus said I’m shocked. He did not. He said I’m chalked.
I don't know if this is everywhere but my local gym removed all auto-belays because of a death connected to one recently. Maybe that was why they were not at the gym?
24:04 has me in tears. I don't know why that's so funny to me
Can we talk about how extremely shredded magnus back is?!
Jason: i don‘t use chalk Magnus: i‘m chalked…
Geek has arrived.  Congrats Geek.
great video as always Magnus, but holy crap 17:21 made me cringe SO HARD, I'm surprised nobody else in comments seems to be affected by it :D
The thumbnail is so awkward
Geek Climber has a contagious smile, you just can not smile while he's smiling
The mark roper song! Flawless
I like how supportive you are towards others and are encouraging them and pushing others for better. That is way cool!
geek climber is goated
Hollywood boulders is pretty cooool!!!!!!!
Someone once asked Will Bosi in one of his Youtube videos how many grades harder could he climb having Adam Ondra cheer him on and he replied with "It's more than you would think" Maybe Geek Climber got the same effect.
The reason why people do two finger pockets like Magnus is because the index finger and the middle finger share tendon connections. Also the ring finger and pinky finger share tendon connections. So if you use middle and ring finger, you should have more strength due to using different tendons.
If you are ever in Dallas, there is a place called OSO Gym. It is smaller bouldering gym, but is by far the nicest gym I have ever been to (both in terms of the staff and the gym).
Welcome to LA!! Glad you got to enjoy that local gym, it looks enticing now. My tot loves to climb and showing him your video was a special treat 😊  You make climbing seem so easy; this video is good proof of how much skill and strength is involved when geekclimber tried what you did.   My son is half Norwegian and half Filipino, so far he's been exhibiting his father's strength so I'm hoping it'll carry throughout his life so he can enjoy things like climbing like you. Thanks for the inspiration and hope you get the most out of your visit here 🌴  (Wishing you good traffic and heat avoidance!)
Oh man I love watching you and Geek Climber climb together! What a fun video! Lots of laughs from me!
So nice to see you pairing up. I watch both of your channels for different reasons and this was a great idea from you both. Geek climber looking a bit star struck and sooooo happy in this video. Love this one.😻
Magnus, you should definitely come to Montreal! We have a handful of great gyms (AllezUp, Bloc Shop for bouldering), and the psicobloc open series event will be happening here in mid August, it would make for a super fun video to see you maybe compete in one of those haha, or at least try the route. The people here are all super friendly and psyched about climbing and the outdoors :D
”I’m chalked” 😲  Magnus 2022 A.D.
@16:45 was hilarious!
Unfortunately a lot of the Touchstone network of gyms in California are soft. I get super shut down when I go out of state and climb somewhere else and I think that’s the consensus among my friends as well. Wish you could have climbed at Cliffs of Id in LA too!
Magnus Facial reaction (O.O) YOU DONT USES CHALK, his brain stopped working ***BLANKED**** XD
Oh this is great! I've been following both of you for years now and I can't wait to see what tips and technique advice you have for Geek Climber, I think he could learn a lot from your flowy, poppy style in bouldering, as he is more of a slow and controlled type. I used to be like that but had to learn to jump a bit and be more efficient and dynamic because I'm really short, and it feels awesome to monkey around. He's done some ninja warrior courses on his channel and I can see he could benefit a lot from loosening up and practicing that coordination for dynamic movements.
Nice one!
I love magnus' iconic bgm that he's always used for his videos.
Very pleasant
Thanks for french grading, it's very comfortable
As an audience, we've been blessed by all these collabs that Magnus has made on his trip to the US. They've really been awesome videos. I still can't get over the free solo with Alex Honold. I'm secretly hoping for a climbing/parkour collab with Toby Segar from Storror at some point when he returns to Europe...
Loved the video! Would love to see you try to find some of the hardest or hidden climbing gyms in different regions (thorough word of mouth?). I really like seeing videos where you are projecting challenging boulders (:
Geek Climber uses no chalk?? Thanks for making all the holds sweaty.
Hey magnus the reason you use those two fingers for pockets isn't the length it's because they are connected to the same muscle and it's a strong one
That red 'V7' at 12 minutes looks like a total jug-fest! More like a V2-3?!
Loved the music around the 8:30 mark!
When I think of LA I think of Skid Row and Compton.  Two of my favorite places to have fun.
Wtf, what's next, a bowler discovers it's better to use a bowling ball instead of a melon?
You're pulling out all the good collabs lately
Har du vurdert å lage en video på høyt og lavt? Helst en av de med litt "vanskelige" løyper da. Det hadde vært kult å se hvordan en klatrer i din klasse hadde lekt seg der.
Wow compared to magnus’ videos at his home gym, this one is super soft.
Magnus making V10 look like V4 all day is absolutely mental :D
Its like American martial arts training for kids. Everybody gets a black belt at the end of the course. Otherwise the parents get angry. Cause thats what they feel they paid for. No skills needed. Everybody is best.
Go get some sun brother! And a haircut😁 U r amazing strong!! Hope U collab with Eric again! U have to meet the new members of his crew! Iam sure about that they get inspired of U!  It was nice to see how hard the problems really are when jason tried some of your flashs! Unbelieveable!!!
The lats at 15:10. Good God.
It's nice to see that shirts are not obsolete for Magnus, even if only for slapping the holds.
Thanks for this cool video! Jason seems to be a really nice and composed person. I am actually grabbing 2-finger pockets the same way he does, and my index finger is also closer in length to my middle finger than my ring finger is ^^
Damn Magnus, you missed out on a lot of "that's what she said" jokes again.  5€ could be yours if you dare to do at least one on your next video!
Really nice video!!!! It's cool that you're trying out so many new gyms. Will you also go climbing in Switzerland one day? Dear greetings from Switzerland
13:54 "It looks really hard. It looks really slopey."  Proceeds to casually climb it without any problems.
Man I miss grades in my gym aha. They stopped doing them because I guess they got tired of people complaining about the accuracy of the posted grade, it being either too easy or too hard. So they just said fine, you figure it out
It was fun seeing you collaborate with geek climber!
Geek: "I don't use chalk." Magnus: " ... GET OUT!"
YESSIR BANGER COLLAB
Great video Magnus! Come up to the Bay, we can show you some great spots to climb :D
2:38 "I'm chalked"
And now we all want to be coached by Magnus haha! Very nice video!
"I don't use chalk" the face that Magnus makes 🤣 priceless.
Hey Magnus,  I really feel like u described my stile of climbing  ^^. Would u consider to travel  to "cafe Kraft" (in Nürnberg) with A. Megos ?
Magnus us a chalk salesman at heart.
@2:25  Magnus: “you don’t use chalk?!!?” Geek: “I don’t use chalk” Magnus: “I’m chalked 😶‍🌫️”
Magnus with this hairstyle somehow fits the Twilight's universe... could see him in a vampire cape climbing a castle wall
<3
OMG THE COLLAB I NVR KNEW I NEEDED
Don't think that necessarily climbers and geeks are that far apart. You have to be a bit of a geek to "solve problems" while exercising.
Omg v7 without chalk! But with it u  could v9 easy! Fantastic
This day is gonna be good, new Magnus video incoming!
Magnus noooo, don’t do it to em like this LOL
"When you think of LA you probably think movies and famous people"  Me who grew up listening to YouTubers trash talk LA  "High prices, Lack of Job Security, Smelly streets with trash, homeless issues, famous people" 😂
You have to go to Innsbruck and try the climbing gym there!!!
I will definitely start watching GeekClimer. I have a Geek Climber in my D&D group.
Geek Climber absolutely crushed that V6!
Fountanebleau holds.... how bout a vlog trip to France?
Dude you are just goals. Thank you for your content.
19:56 Magnus demonstrates the proper use of a shirt.
He doesn't use chalk WTF?! There's no way it doesn't do anything for him. It's actually surprising how low level he is at climbing based on his content and his challenges he's done. Great video!
Awesome to see you in LA! Wish it had been at cliffs of id, but I'll have to hit up hollywood to try out the same boulders you did in this video. (if they're still up.)
15:55 Magnus claims he's not a good coach, but then teaches GeekClimber how to apply chalk as only Magnus could.
Where are you heading to next Magnus?
Hi Magnus, any chance for you to come to Hong Kong? There are so many GYMs now in the city! We will be very very happy if you can come and climb with us and rate our GYMs!
Does this mean Magnus us going through all his US friends?
Magnus keeps on making people addicted to chalk
Magnus dying inside when reading sponsor text.
Content is amazing. One of my most favourite channels. Should be on Netflix or similar.
What I love about this collab is how Jason is able to ask in-depth questions about holds and techniques for average climbers and couch potatoes like myself. He really helped put into perspective what I take for granted as normal rock climbing when in reality Magnus is at such a high/pro-level.
Magnus amazing V12 & great collaboration with Geek climber.
I thought when geek climber said no chalk that magnus would be out of there
Come to Vietnam; loose chalk and no tops are expected 😂
You can tell he had no idea about what he saying during the Nord ad.
THATS MY GYM!!! it’s so cool seeing y’all trying it out (and doing some I’ve been trying lol)
Great collab video! 🤘 Congrats on each other’s flash V6 & V11. Cool support for 5Bar. No chalk - amazing. 😲 Epic coaching by Magnus on your V4 video Geekclimber.
If I ever get the chance to climb with you that day will be one of the best days of my life. I wouldn't be able to keep up at all (I'm usually on V5-6) but I still think it would be an amazing experience. Love all that you do. Thanks for being awesome
dislike:  ads suck
How long are you in LA for Magnus?
Longer ring finger than pointer finger = proper testosterone during early development.  Magnus likely had a great 1st 4 years of life.  Kudos to his parents!
Hope that you'll visit Singapore soon! The boulder scene exploded here roughly 3 years ago.
Nice to see Magnus in L.A. - I haven't tried Hollywood Boulders, but bouldering & top roping at Cliffs of Id and bouldering at Verdigo Boulders have both been fun.
quick question: Do you lift weights? Or did you start climbing and eventually got where you are (strength wise)
When Geek Climber finds out about brushing the holds it's over for you b*tches
It's somewhat fitting that you're filming a climbing video in Hollywood.
Glad to see the Norwegian Chalk Cartel has hooked another addict
please come to Korea too~ let me guide you awesome Korean climbing gym!
19:56 Is that Mark Rober's background music?
Hey Magnus! You should swing by the Pad in San Luis Obispo (our local gym) next time you’re in California- SLO is halfway between LA and SF. There’s also some sweet local boulders and crags that are super accessible!
Magnus! Next time you're in LA please come rate Sender One in LAX! I'll belay you all day 😆
9:40 magnus breaking down the science of climbing what a cool little discovery
"Geek Climber's is on the thumb, I'm watching right now." Both enjoyable Climber's to watch but so different. Great video.
If you ever visit Albuquerque, New Mexico you should visit stone age climbing gym. Super nice climbing gym!
I wish my gym graded like this
15:03 I thought we was gonna say "offensive" 😅
Could you try a collab with a ParaClimber? That would be a cool video :)
Hey Magnus! If you're still in the LA area, you should reach out to Ludwig and try to climb with him! He's a big youtube/twitch star who has recently gotten really into climbing and he loves doing stuff with different creators!
YES. Been watching geek climber for a while, great to see this collab
Your videos are getting better and better!!
Gotta be one of the best feelings in the world having magnus behind you yellin cmon and cheering you on. What a dream.
A Derek the video guy appearance!
You should come out to Hawaii. HiClimb and Volcanic on the island of Oahu.
Made that white V10 look so easy
3:25 my thoughts exactly. how the hell is geek climber not a double digit boulderer
13:25 -  Lies... Probably over 75% of the climbers I know are huge nerds
Really enjoyed watching this....thank you for sharing!
Been watching for a while and this is one of my favorites magnus, all the tips and tricks videos are good and all, but I love the personal information you give in those brief moments of explaining a hold or a move like in your own way of explaining. feel free to do mini cuts like that in the future 😁😁
Magnus, I hope you can make it to San Diego and do the same kind of video there!!
The audio at 17:20 is so satisfying
You are stupid amazing. So fun to watch you dance up a wall.
This was awesome! It's like having two of your friends meet and be awesome together.
10:45 The expectation and the route tingle the nerves in a weird way
I never see this coming, great collab!
i love geek climber
I climb at Hollywood!! Really cool to see you climbing at a home gym! Great vid!
Would love it if Magnus could make it to Portland or Seattle to check out the gyms, not sure they're better just would be interesting.
I wish you'd visited Sender One in LAX! Their lead wall is insane. Oh, well, maybe next time.
I think Jason just don't have some muscle strength, that only the case. He could climb V5 and more, if he could spend more of his time on gym. But he doesn't really needed it. 🤷 Like, usual people like us have a job. It's not going anywhere. And YouTube climbing it's just a hobby ☺️
I have a friend who says chalk doesn't make a difference. I honestly can feel a difference in v2 using chalk, it helps so so much.
Looks like your doing West Coast tour between Anton, Honnold, and Geek Climbing, hope you come north to PNW! We got good gym and trad.
I always say it's very deceiving watching people like Magnus climb because they make it look way much easier than what it really is. Always nice to see a more average yet good climber like Jason/Geek Climber climb beside. Really puts into perspective the vast level of difference it really is
Love seeing these Collaboration videos
You can climb shirtless at every gym in California 🤣
What if Geek Climber went from v7 max to like v12 just by using chalk lol I never knew he didn't use chalk!
The quality is amazing, you should consider filming a full length climbing movie, Outdoor, indoor, guests, YouTube, Clothing company, smoking hot Girlfriend (should be in more videos!!!) The Army challenges, if you want to come to Utah, I'll take you on a 100 Mile backpacking trip where most of the trip will be above 10,000 ft. Okay maybe the last one would be for me, but seriously Filming a full length movie, Epic challenge.
Oh snap! Collab with Geek Climber! His channel is about to explode!
Oh my god! Two my favorite YouTubers in collab!!! Yeaaaahh
My home gym! Wish I could have been there when you were filming! So inspiring to see you crush the uncrushable. Thanks Magnus!!
I like the "butt-bar" move Magnus did in the V4 slab on his video lol
I love the sound of the fingernails on the wall, that's a cool detail to include.
What was with that sponsor segment... It was like Magnus was held hostage and was asked to read a script under duress.😂
20 minutes in, it became a Mark Rober video 😂
Touchstone has the best rated gyms on lockdown in Cali
I'm sure the chalk helped on that V8, but if you took your shirt off also you would have sent it for sure
Great collab
Adam Ondra is lucky Geek Climber has been climbing with his shirt on and without chalk all these years.
this mans about to use chalk for everything now.. chalk makes everything better
Not to be that guy.... but I'll be that guy. If that was a v6 I'm a v20 climber.
Magnus needs to visit DYNO Detroit so I can be inspired to finish my project.
I really enjoyed this video!, thank you
Magnus seemed like he felt legitimately offended after watching Jason’s improvement with the chalk lol
USA doesnt know how to routeset
Love hearing Magnus break down problems and coaching other climbers.  Thanks for the video!
Magnus climbing with Geek? Its another dream come true! Hopefully they could get around to checking out some local San Diego crags in a future video
Magnus been watching Mark Rober
You should have gone to cliffs of Id not too far away. The lead wall is pretty nice and they have a bunch of cracks to climb and even an offwidth
Magnus really made it look so easy.
Magnus really opened this mans chalk-ra haha
more videos with geekclimber!
Geek Climber asked about the chalk no chalk difference but missed the big question. Shirt no shirt difference
Last week Honnold and now Geek Climber? Where can it possibly go from here?! Thanks for another fun and inspiring video! 😊🙏🏼
You should come to Dallas, TX to climb!
Magnus try central rock gym in Cambridge Massachusetts!
After listening to your podcast on the Nugget, I had to pay attention to your editing. And it's damn good!
My home gym!! <3
you should have tried the UFO wall. That one has some interesting problems.
Any chance you swing by Atlanta?
The way the music subtly faded in around 19:56 made that transition from dialogue to climbing feel really organic and nice. Magnus is out here inspiring us to climb and also doing great editing work to keep the vids top quality.
Shirt, no chalk, slow static climber. Loved seeing a collab with Magnus' climbing opposite!
This is my home gym and im here pretty much everyday. I wanted to meet you! But this seems like months ago based on the routes. Hope to meet you in the future!
Their chemistry as humans, discovering the differences in their hands and how it affects their climbing 💗🥰
Magnus spreading the way of the chalk.
Oh very cool! Was planning on climbing at Hollywood Boulders tomorrow, I haven't been in a while. Hopefully the video is recent and some of the problems are still up, I'd love to see how well I fare on these
THAT'S MY GYM!!!!!!!!!!! I love this place. This is the most amazing gym in all of Los Angeles.
Omg I never knew geek climbers name until this video haha!
I can imagine the setters are ecstatic seeing Magnus on their problems. I would be. “He did the thing!” 😂
You should go to Stronghold climbing gym in LA! Its a great local gym with some awesome rope climbs and some cool boulder problems. Super homey vibe there.
You should come visit Peak Experiences in Richmond, Virginia if you ever have the time! Triangle Rock Club is another one near it that is very popular! I'd love to see what you think of the boulders and top rope climbing here :) I'm loving these videos of you visiting all these new gyms!
This guy doesn't use chalk. That's not so surprising, I only use chalk if a route is giving me a fear response (sweaty palms), and that doesn't happen with anything below a V20.
LOL. Anything less than V14 aint worth doing
After climbing free solo with Alex not long ago, do you feel invincible when you are climbing these indoor gyms?
How can you have a yt channel about climbing and be like: "I've never tried chalk"? Is this a joke?
This must be a great opportunity for this guy to be featured on your channel I remember when he had like 300 subs
he gets finger injuries that hold him back, but, he, still, doesn't, use, chalk . . . not sure if @geekclimber is much of a geek. geeks are typically open to good data
2:36 "I'm chalked"  I see what you did there Magnus 👌🏽
Anyone else confused by the Mark Rober song when Magnus climbs the V11
Interesting to see a ‘normal’ climber fail on routes which is so easy for Magnus to climb. 💪
As someone from the SF Bay Area, it was very fun to watch top SF gyms and LA gyms back to back and compare! Also, very fun to see new guests on the channel
If you get the chance, check out stronghold. Not a lot of boulders, but I really think you'd like the rope area. Small business owners for the gym and a fantastic community. Probably not great for video making though. But their bouldering location should be open in a few years.
Around 1:52 a big dude in striped prison pants & a beard walked in the gym & I thought 'is that Jason Momoa? They are in LA' (I realize the dude looked nothing like him, but being that I was focused on Magnus & Geek Climber I just saw the pants & did a double take lol). But anyway, I'm so glad you guys got to collab, Geek Climber's videos have helped me a lot.
Also it’s so impressive to see Magnus when he makes those bad holds look easy when in reality most people couldn’t even start on them
I feel all the touchstone gyms in socal are great but my personal favorite has always been Cliffs of Id
Awesome seeing you doing collabs, with ‘smaller’ channels even though his is really big by climbing standards
Anyone notice brandon william's cameraman derek at 2:06?
pretty criminal how your free solo video doesn't have 10mil views, i blame your thumbnail
Of course magnus would get geek climber to use chalk hahaha, I miss Tom always making fun of your chalk man. But amazing climb with Alex !@!!!!! I WAS SWEATING.
What microphone is this man how can i hear his nail scratching from so far away
Just commenting for the algorithm. Excellent editing, nice collab and an overall fantastic video as always.
Oh to climb at a gym that overgrades 😭
Some dude at my gym climbs no chalk and crushes - it’s quite the sight
Your videos make me genuinely happy
This was so fun to watch and witness Geek Climber FLASH A V6!! Epic, that's the power of climbing with you Magnus.
Try Boulderdash sfv !!
HWB is a decent enough gym for training for outdoors but for gym climbing specifically, there are significantly better gyms in LA. Stronghold, Sender One, and Cliffs of Id for example are significantly bigger with more to offer the gym-only climbers. Full sized weight/machine areas, training boards, a good amount of boulders spanning the grades, and lots of rope climbing (lead, TR, and autobelay).
Please climb in klättrrcentret in Malmö super creative route setting
Awesome video as always Magnus! Loved seeing you both climb together!   So excited to see you here in Cali! If you’re still in Southern California and get the chance, it would be awesome to see you try out Flowstone climbing gym in Redlands :) It’s a small bouldering gym with some amazing routes, and my home gym. (They let you climb shirtless 😉)  I’ve been climbing since Jan and your videos have been really inspiring. I just sent my first V4/V5 a few days ago.  Looking forward to the next video!
I would love to see you in Sharma Climbing Gavà, Magnus :)
Always great videos 👌 Btw, uttalelse på "cleanliness" er 'klenn-li-ness 😉
I started climbing this April because I was inspired from your videos! I just climbed my second v6 yesterday and I’m just so thankful I found your channel. Thanks for all the amazing content!!
That gym sounds like an insane asylum
Meanwhile… Magnus just FREE SOLO’d a massive face with Alex Honnold like days prior… hahahaha
Admittedly not heard of Geek climber, but ill go watch and sub in a moment, awesome real nice lad!
9:40 Is interesting because Magnus Ringfinger is longer than his index finger which means he has naturally higher testosteron levels. But also higher chance of heart disease.  Geek Climber has his index finger longer than his Ringfinger which means he has naturally lower testosteron. But has lower chance of heart disease.
17:20 i lost
Your videos get me stoked to climb. Climb hard.
After the Honnold craziness this one was a very wholesome pallet cleanser. Have been following both of your channels for a long time so very fun to see you colab!:))
Great vid! I always like how these gym vids become Magnus Send Fest in the second half haha
Magnus, so weird to see you climbing at my home gym! I’ve climbed some of those same problems haha
The dead point on the V8 boulder is just amazingly perfect !
love both your channels, awsome video as always Magnus
I also climb with little chalk, but it's mostly because as a beginner doing jugs and pinches it doesn't feel too useful.
gotta bring this series home with best rated gym in bergen 😉
if your still in la climb at stronghold. Its the best gym in la and has an awsome arch with high 13s
Awesome! I love Jason's channel! =]
Lol you can't get ya head around not using chalk. I find it crazy too.
You should go down to San Diego. Not only is it much better than LA but it has a few great gyms called Mesa Rim.
Gotta go to the riviter for rock climbing in nc
Not sure if someone has already commented this, but the reason you use your two middle fingers instead of index and middle is because they are connected in your hand so they are actually stronger together than middle and index.
Surprised Magnus isnt going to senderone.  If you want a lead gym, go there
is there mark rober colab happening soon??!!
Breaking news: Shirtless norwegian ex-competition climber gets geek adicctet to white powder! (SHOCKING!)
Should've visited Sender! Least I know where to go if I need a morale boost lol Great video you guys
Magnus   Why is your Free solo Video gone ?
My favorite part is when Geek Climber accomplishes something he didn't think he could, the flash. That is the essence of this channel - inspiring people. The sense of achievement was palpable!
I just want to say I like seeing 2 people do the same bolder. Especially when they fail.
Come to Ascend in Pittsburgh!!  Great boulder setting here but maybe nothing that will push you.
I’m really enjoying this series, but I feel like maybe just picking one problem per grade at random more or less might not really reflect a gym’s general setting. Maybe it would be too intrusive and you’d have to get waivers from people and stuff buuut I think asking random people at the gym what they’ve been projecting recently or for one of their favorite routes currently up would be a nice way to get a better feel of a place.
"Chalk is all you needed" with that face just sounded like a drug addict trying so hard to make you join them
its not the lenght of the fingers. its about how the tendons work. you use the two fingers in the middle cause they are the ones that work best together, you have more power. look it up :D great video. long time fan of geek
I'm curious on magnus's opinion on: - A route with hard hold but an easy-to-figure beta - A route with relatively medium to easy holds but the beta is very creatively complex.  Mainly asking since the V11 he did in the video was very straightforwards.
My former climbing gym. LOVE that place.
I also don't sweat on my palms!  I might put chalk on once at the start of a session but that is it. And often I don't even do that.
touchstone gym superiority
16:44 6 seconds of Magnus roasting Geek climber, lol
20:07 that mark Rober music hit different. Fits like a glove!!
btw on that yellow in 14:36 geek missed a foot that on the right when he was without chalk
I still haven't heard a convincing argument to posting grades in a gym instead of ranges. V/YDS grades are just too fine of a measurement for a gym climb
Is it safe to say that most of the grades are 1-2 grades easier at this gym? Like a v8 is actually a v6...
Awesome vid! Love to see collabs with all my other favorite climbing youtubers! You should do one with Movement for Climbers!
Geek: "I don't use chalk" Magnus: "Mommy come pick me up I'm scared"
Try tromsø klatresenter
Geek climbers next video should be charting the shear strength difference between chalk brands.
I love how Magnus was already chalked up in the shot after GeekClimber said he doesn't use chalk lol
MARK ROBER???
Please maggie, cut your nails i can hear the crunch
Geek Climber: "Yeah I don't use chalk, never will." Magnus: " *blinks, visibly shaken*....we'll fix that"
2:37 im... im chalked xD
Why do you use google rating though ?! You really think they are the ones to believe? =)
somehow geek climber made the perfect questions
19:53 Mark Rober enters the gym.
This is great chemistry!
Really wholesome dude, it’s a shame about his finger injury’s but he’s still killing it. Very well done!
Now this was a collab I didn’t expect but really wanted!
Dude, come on down to Cliff's of Id in Culver City!  Loads of fun.
hey that's the Mark Rober sound
oh but it's not the best :(
nice collab and nice vid :)
I like him rating the hard ones which be does five it's so wholesome
Great watch!!!!
Magnus sharing first dose of chalk for free… We all know how it works!😂😂😂 Great video with an amazing guest!🔥🤘
you should climb in American Fork Canyon Utah
Amazing video! Had lot of fun watching it 😊
Awesome just awesome 🔥
I am so happy, today is my birthday and I got new climbing shoes. I just climbed with them and they feel amazing.
I like how asian fomenko climbs!
Mark Rober making an unexpected appearance
touchstone represent
It feels like Geek could use some more dynamic in some boulders. It looks like he burns through a lot of energy with being overly static
I am a subscriber, but I came here, to this video, because I saw geek climber's vid
Magnus you make it look so easy!
Those heel hooks on the v6 flash looked really smooth. Nice job
Great collab! geek climber was the second channel I got into after Magnus, I guess not that much of a surprise if they are 2 of the biggest yt
You should check out some climbing in new hampshire 🤘
Magnus' climbing ability seems absolutely insane when pitted against a mortal.
10:02 flush because of the camera :D next one without the t-shirt aka Magnus style :)))
V12 was like a 2 in my gym
it's a humbling reminder to me when I see a light guy who can do one arm pull-ups struggle... that I'm a long way from a v10 lol
Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing when magnus does the black V11?
Great video, guys 🤙
"it looks hard" *flashes it*
Magnus is one of the biggest reasons I started climbing a few months ago and this is the gym that I go to!! Bummer that I missed a chance to say hi but I can’t wait to go tonight and try out some of those harder problems! Thank you for the inspiration Magnus :)
Magnus thank you from these videos. And specially to see other people in these. Big chalck puff from collab with mr. Geek.  I have ask you to contact Jason Kehl and that would the big sickness to enjoy from tube.... BUT. This is something I have been wanting for so long. Friendly boulder competition with Jared Leto and Jason Momoa. Please make this happen!!! Ask Sharma to support it.🤣
All you need is chalk <3
"All you need is..." CHALK
I love these videos. Back to the roots of fun bouldering. You should checkout The grotto gym in San Diego or Mesa Rim
NO CHALK COLLAB IN A MAGNUS VID ??? Should be illegal lol
Ahh, cool to see you both in my old home-gym. I moved across the country but I loved HoBo. It’s where I climbed my first V3, first V4, first V5, and first V6! And yes, the grading definitely tends toward soft (it’s variable, but overall, soft), but I remember it often having very creative, fun setting (especially boulders set by Zoe—hers are always fun). Lots of quirky stuff that I’d have to really think about and discuss with people around me. Idk I always enjoy the stuff on the “cobra” feature—like the black v8 (v9?) you did with the topout. And I think there’s a lot of fun stuff for shorter climbers. Instructive setting too—all the V3s through V5s would teach me things, as a new climber. Geek Climber counted it as a negative that the V0 he tried made him switch feet a lot, but I actually think that’s a plus—people who are just starting out and working on V0s need to learn how and when to switch feet and step through and smear.  It also had really welcoming weekly meetups, classes, movie nights, informal comps, etc (LAB and Cliffs of Id too).  One thing—if there’s no “finish” indicated, it’s expected that you grab the top of the wall. So there’s on extra move you may have been skipping on some of these. Probably doesn’t make much of a difference though.
Climb at Stronghold! Get your lead on! Haha
11:15 I got a little hype for this
Your next vid should be “I tried every rated climbing gym”
This is my local gym!! Glad you had a good time there, Magnus. Was cool to see you guys climb projects I'm working on.
Nice Collab!
“What do you think is the easiest way to climb this?” “I think the easiest thing would be to find another boulder” HAHAHA relatable.
Shout-out to Touchstone Climbing (my home gym). They were the Best SF/Oakland gym and now LA gym (Hollywood, but you also mentioned LA Boulders, which they also manage). They have other locations in Sacramento and central California. The routes are always a lot of fun, for both bouldering and ropes, great variety, amazing staff, chill atmosphere, and friendly fellow climbers where it's super easy to make friends.
I'm also a don't really use chalk kinda person and it's mostly a sensory thing for me? I don't like the feeling of it on my hands. Still, I will use it occasionally when I'm outside or going hard. But if I'm just messing around in the gym or training? Nope. No thanks.
magnus was so broken ,when he said that he doesnt User cholk
Hi Magnus. How did you like California? Did you get to San Diego?
Another banger!
What was more intense and harrowing - this sesh with Geek Climber or free soloing with Alex Honnold?
My gym!
Magnus looking older here!
Classic climbing content. Gotta love it. Excited to see what other collabs you have planned!
Touchstone with the soft grading 😬
Love this videos, thank you Magnus 😋
Nice work guys! Geek climber - no worries on the chalk! I’ve climbed for 12 years and barely use it since I have dry skin. Chalk use totally depends on skin type. I actually have to add a couple drops of water to my hands sometimes to get friction.
Interesting point about the finger lengths for pockets. I usually used my middle + ring finger for two-finger pockets, but sometimes switch to using index + middle if my ring finger is feeling particularly sore/weak
V12 here, V6 in my gym.
This is my gym!! Hope you enjoyed :)
loving your recent climbing videos, magnus! Very well edited and entertaining! Thanks for that :-)
So excited to see this collab!
I haven't even watched the video and i click like!
A collaboration with geek climber. Yay, this is so cool I won't skip the ads this time.
i sometimes pause just to make the video last longer. And that geek is a funny guy. Cool vid!
Collab with geek climber? Yeah, instant like
Have you ever been to the "Kletterzentrum Innsbruck" in Austria? If not, you need to try it!
ha love that the star he showed was rock climbing legend Tom Cruise
What a great guy!
I noticed on tiktok that American gyms tend to grade super soft compared to UK gyms whom are known for their sandbagging grading skills :) An UK climber feels like a God in US. While an American will cry in UK. Of Europe in general.
I’m about to move to LA permanently and start using this gym — thanks for the review Magnus 🦧🦧🦧
hey Magnus, love the gym rating format! I hope you come to Austria one day, specifically Vienna. We have some great gyms here. the best for Bouldering is boulderbar, they always have interesting and unique routes.
i will never get used to watching you guys just jump down.. scares the shit out of me every time
AWESOME video!
geekclimber seems to be such a nice person! very likeable
Most humble and wholesome climber out there. Always a pleasure to watch you climb.
can u make a vid on climbing terminology? It'd be nice to know what, "slope", "slab", "jug", "crux", and all that stuff exactly means. Thanks.
9:21 i climb with the two left (or right) and not with the middle fingers ;-;
Kinda felt like Magnus was a bit uncomfortable in this video, maybe because he didn't know Geek Climber, maybe because they're both climbers, but their grades are so different. From what I've seen by him Geek Climber seems like a really cool, down to earth person though, so I hope they had fun filming together :)
16:43 you can see magnus's love for chalk
Coming to Denver while you're in the states?
El Geek is such a likable guy.
crazy watching you float all these climbs at one of my local gyms. A good reference for showing how damn strong you are haha
I love seeing the comparison of people  that aren't as good as magnus trying the stuff he flashes, just puts things into perspective. That's why we need an average joe at every event at the olympics :D
Only old school Mitdbø fans remember when his tv fell of the trash can
my 2 favorites climbing channels  <3
I've never met anyone else who uses their index and middle on pockets! Haha I do the same. I feel much weaker when using middle and ring. They are both my longest fingers, so maybe that is the determining factor as Magnus suggested? Interesting!
Finally geek climber! Please make more with him.
Another convert to the cult of chalk! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
Could you do a video of you trying the moonboard benchmarks i think it would be fun to watch.
Been waiting for a collab with geekclimber for years, stoked it finally happened!😁
Awesome video 🔥👌
Great collab
I want someone who loves me as much as Magnus likes chalk.
Regarding the pocket fingers, the two middle fingers (the ones Magnus prefers) share an antagonist tendon, which I think is also a reason they're often preferred.
I just follow two climbers on youtube. Now they are both together - dream!!
The slight juxtapositions in your styles were really interesting to see! Jason really figured out a way of making that V6 work with high heel hooks on the fly, where Magnus might have committed to more dynamic moves - it's why climbing is amazing, two different styles to reach the same outcome! Great video!
I had to go watch Geek Climber's video during this one. Nice, this is something I need to watch more. I used to love climbing trees as a kid and I need to find motivation to get in better shape. Thanks Magnus and Jason.
I just watch a man yeet himself up a wall using 2 fingers the fuck am i doing with my life
I swear Magnus made all the V below 10 look like V1 or V2. Watching this I was like oh...I could climb that. And then you see Geek struggled and realized yeah that’s hard lol
Geek climber is so jacked and you still make him look weak
He's never even TRIED using chalk?!
WOW this gym looks softer grading than my gym. The difference is truly insane...
Geek climbing treating chalk like it's a performance enhancing drug.
hey magnus will you try a gym in blefast, UK
Magnus come to Pittsburgh and climb at Ascend and Iron City Boulders!
This is a comment for the algorithm.
Geek Climber built different
Hey Magnus!  Great to finally see the video released!  I was at the gym when you came by to film, and we chatted a bit while I was trying the white v10.  It was really nice to meet you finally!  You have been one of my greatest inspirations for training and staying motivated, and I’ve been watching your videos since 2018!  I had to leave and go to work that day, which was a bummer because I would have loved to work on a boulder problem with you.  The video will have to do I guess!  Thanks for everything you do!
really enjoy the new music!
Love you magnus
You should swing by Hangar 18 in Arcadia! It's very close to the LA area. The gym is a small bouldering gym and probably not anything special to you, but it would be so damn cool if I could just see you there and say hi, haha!
Sender One Magnus! Sender One!
The difference in confidence / comfort in this weeks video compared to last week's is hilarious... Magnus is back in his element! Great back to back collabs, your videos keep getting better Magnus!
Grades look really soft. It's either that or the boulders in Magnus' gym here in Oslo just jumped so much in difficulty and it's not even the hardest gym here in Oslo!
The hype I got when geek climber put on chalk for the first time, and was able to make progress on the Boulder problem. It really works 😂😂😂
COME TO THE BOULDER FIELD IN SACRAMENTO. Best setting on the west coast ;)
no
I love these videos! I'm pretty new to your channel but watching you progress from each level of problems is my personal favorite kind of content to watch. Guilty that I have been binge watching your videos :) And the collabs with other climbers also gives it a fresh new perspective. Great content Magnus!
There is a Bob Ross Hiden in this Video <3
Hey Magnus! If you are ever back in the LA area you should come check out Top Out climbing gym! I work Front desk staff there and we'd love to have you come check it out! Much love!
The funny thing about the finger length thing is that if your fingers are like Magnus's then it means you had more testosterone in your body as a fetus so usually women have fingers like Geek climber
couldfeel the awkwardnes through the screen
I'm really enjoying this series of videos where you rate different gyms. I especially appreciate that you rate the routesetting through all of the grades--I think setting in the V0-V2 range doesn't get enough attention, so hopefully you put some pressure on gyms to make sure they're setting interesting problems in that range!
Softest grades I've seen
We've been waiting for the video!
@magnus I would like to see you climb in the netherlands, Delfts bleau
You should come to Montreal, we got a cool climbing community here. Lots of gyms for you to try Magnus.
Shoulda gone to Stronghold! Best gym in LA!
My home gym!
GC: I don't use chalk. Magnus: I'm chalked... 👀
I’m imagining an alternative universe where Geek Climber was evil, he’d just be angry face all the time cause this dude smiled so much lol
Another man converted to the Church of Chalk. Doing the lord's work, Brother Magnus
Magnus don't take this the wrong way but from the thumbnail it looks like you can't flex for shit. Now neither can I but I like to think there's at least a slight improvement when I try real hard. You just look the same with bent arms.  Maybe an idea for a next video? Get some bodybuilder to teach you some tricks.   Also if someone steals Geek Climbers skin it's absolutely Satanist serial killers and not me looking for a shortcut to the next grade.
Awesome content, and Jason has great English in person too!
Aw yeah! Geek Climber is awesome!
Why did Magnus have to flex on Geek Climber with that V7😆
Chalk👏
17:20 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH THAT SOUND!
I find it funny that he doesnt think geek and climber goes together. Just about all the climbers ive met are geeks
Awesome video loving the collabs! where do you think you're going to be going next?
Hey Magnus! I wish you could do a collab with Tim & Ross and TAMY Channel aswell. Both channels of worldcup climbers :)
You can’t not use chalk around magnus. It will not stand.
Geek - I dont sweat anymore.  Magnus - I´m chalked
Geek has to be the coolest software engineer in the world
I love videos when Magnus coaches or climbs with others who aren't as good (which is everyone basically but thats not a bad thing) and see him hype them up especially with geek climber of all people
You shoulda rolled up to rockreation smh
Love these holds crunching :D
Geek Climber will from now on live up to his name for he has chalk up his nostrils courtesy of Magnus.
I clapped when he flashed that V6. I love how stoked he is
Love the colab! Never thought I'd see  it!
Chalk is aid!😁 I neither use Chalk my hands are usually not sweaty. I used to use it, but it was more of a distraction than anything else…
upload moreeee i love ur videos soo much
magnus needs to try some of the harder gyms on socal. hollywood boulders has the softest, least creative hard climbs i’ve climbed. i hate to hate but it’s true
Love the collab! If you're still in CA, you should check out the gyms in the San Diego area. The Mesa Rim in San Marcos is super nice and would make a good video.
nice music nice music
Cool to see two worlds of my YouTube climbing feed combining forces
Am i the only one waiting for the juji video?
That dude needs a gummy smile correction so bad it's unbelievable.. holy shit
Awesome.
"I`m chalked", that was just amazing.
First Magnus gets Geek Climber to use chalk. Next he will get him to climb shirtless.
what an amazing video watching 2 of my favorite content creators together
Magnus convincing him to use chalk sounded like him trying to convert him to a religion 💀
Magnus it has been a pleasure watching your channel grow from your very first few vlogs. I remember then you were unsure of what would come and look at the strides you have made. Thank you for the time and commitment!
17:20 That disgusting sound while looking at his fingers makes it seem like his fingers are crunchy as hell!
Magnus, I’m sure you’ve talked about this before (I remember something about it in your collab with Adam Ondra), but how do you maintain your fingernails?? Hearing them scrape on the wall makes me die a little each time😖
so mad i missed magnus in LA the one influencer i like
I've been watching Geek Climber for a while but never knew he didn't use chalk lol
24:02 That power screeam lol
if you're still in the la area topout climbing is the highest rated gym in the greater LA area
Imagine if Magnus climbed with Ludwig and Nick if he's already in LA
Come to Reno Nevada / lake Tahoe!
it kinda looks like “geek climbers” right arm looks giant compared to his left arm like quagmire in that one episode in the part of the video right after the sponsorship mention 😭
There’s nothing funnier than how happy it makes Magnus to introduce people to chalk
I have the same fingers and geek climber, my pointer and middle are closer size than my ring finger.
The editing is on another level
I love the way magnus' tshirt slowly transforma into a climbing brush as the climbs get harder  Also love the Mark Rober music on V11
Magnus if you’re ever on the east coast check out rock climb fairfield in connecticut. Ive only been climbing for a few weeks but the routes at my gym look a lot more creative. Their v2-v4 have some nice roof climbs with some tricky footholds (for me at least) on volumes sticking out of the ceiling.
Marvel: “Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover in history.” Magnus: Hold my chalk bag
There is actually a lot of sotware engineers climbing at my local bouldering gym. We love solving puzzles, so I think it totally makes sense :)
YO Hollywood boulders is the climbing gym I started at when one of my coworkers (now best friend) introduced me to the sport! I absolutely love that place and the people working there are always super friendly and chill! If your still in the area you've gotta check out Jesse Boy they have got the absolutely best fried chicken I've ever had and it's got a special Korean style twist to it! Also fun fact Hollywood boulders and LA boulders are both owned by touchstone climbing so just goes to show they know what they're doing!
Great video!
very excited to see you collab with greek climber!
Really nice collab! thanks for the effor that you put in your videos :)
19:55 Mark Rober would like to know your location
Nice Video! I think you have to more such a kind of videos. It’s pretty interesting to see, what’s the different between Magnus and a normal freetime climber. New series…..Magnus meets ordinary climber 😊
Chalk stocks just went through the roof
This was a really nice colab! They seem to compliment eachother well in the video!
Ha I thought it said Greek climber lol not geek climber
Oh my gosh I don't think you meant for it to be funny! but I found it hilarious the way he reacts to chalk! come climb in Minneapolis sometime!
E
Geek Climber keeps the shirt and ditches the chalk. He’s the anti-Magnus
17:20 cringe warning!
Geek Climber not using chalk makes sence when you go to his home gym. Mesa Rim has chalk problems. They don't use the AC so climbing in 75F or 24C heat is common. Also for some reason brushing is not common here and frustrates me to no end. For the first year after lock down the gym didn't have brushes available. This means most people over use chalk and don't brush.This combo leads to layers of chalk caked on the holds. We often joke about how the dificulty of a problem can grow as the layers of chalk build up. Most holds that have been up for a week or two are so thickly coated you can't just brush enouph to get down to the plastic anymore. All of this is to say, that in such a setting Geek Climber is not wrong about chalk not making much difference.
Magnus when rating gyms please check the cleanliness of the shower area, this is super important for a lot of climbers that attend frequently
Love geekclimber. Loved the video. Love seeing "normal" climbers try what Magnus does. Jason is a better climber than me, so it really puts it in perspective.
oh wow wanted this colab for ages never thought it would happen lets gooo thx magnus
Your ring and middle finger share the same Ulnar nerve vs middle and index using the Ulnar and Radial nerve. Maybe that's why we like Ring and Middle better, less to coordinate?
You should come back to North Caroline to see Juji and go to Triangle Rock Club! Would love to see how you think their route setting it.
Bra video som vanlig! Og ikke overrasket over at du fikk han til å bruke kalk😅
I’m not sure if other gyms do this but at the touchstone gyms( Hollywood boulders, LA Boulders, cliffs of id, etc.), it seems that the grades become softer in the summertime when there are a lot of new climbers joining the gym and become harder in the wintertime when it’s usually filled with more seasoned climbers.
You could also rate gyms on the accuracy of the grades of the routes in the gym
One of the best videos ever would be Magnus doing some mischief magic together with Storror parkour team.
Been waiting for this collaboration for a while, I saw both vids in my subscription feed and was super excited!
Wow ur in pedowood where all America's pedophile movie stars live and work
Only reason for magnus to bring his shirt is to slap off chalk from the holds
Cool to see all these bouldering collabs with classic bouldering sessions! Looking forward to more of this
17:20 those holds look amazing
Yoooooo the meeting of my 2 favorite climbing channels!!
I sweat everywhere but on my hands, I almost never use chalk, and I see no difference when I use it
If you are ever in sweden-gothemburg I highly recommend Volym. Its a climbing gym that includes two facilities I think its really clean and good! Would be fun to see you climb there and see what you think of it!!
The Camera adds flash ability
You should try the best-rated climbing gym in FRESNO, CA
magnus can you send me please hangboard? its so godamn expensive and shippning to my country is 50 dollar more
"climbing gym in LA where you can climb shirtless" absolutely SENT me 🤣
I have never seen so many down climbing holds. Especially the horizontal line at 18:30. I can’t figure out why that would even be necessary. Great video guys
The colab that I never expected but the colab that I needed
Go to Mesa Rim in San Diego!!!
I wanted to climb there when I lived in Burbank in 2019, but it was just far enough away to be a hassle.
17:21 That nails on wall scraping sound asmr .... O.o <3 magnus!
Chalk works even better when you apply half of it to your face like Magnus.
My home gym! Great to see you send the climbs that I couldn't imagine attempting.  That said I think you would have liked Cliffs of Id more - it's owned by the same people with more modern routesetting and a great lead/toprope area.
It's crazy the different strengths and weaknesses people have, geek climber crushes this difficult looking pull at 11:03 but struggles on the slab, that's cool though that we vary so much
AmaIng video. Love geek climbers videos. But magnus giving him tips to break a plateau was even cooler.   Cant wait for the sequel.
"you call yourself geek climber but you've never used chalk"  made me laugh hahaha
nah, stronghold is better — great video tho!
the Bob ross Poster haha
16:11 best part of the video
I would like to see Magnus take this guy on an exposed multi pitch climb
Crazy seeing my main gym in your video, sad I missed ya
this is a very good collab (y)
I would love to climb with you someday Even though I am just an average climber.. I would love to show you around Tokyo's climbing gym
Will there be any outdoor bouldering videos from the US? :)
just noticed that they didn't have any brushes? you used your shirt to clean holds?lol
Geek Climber and Magnus??! I wish I wasn't at work right now lol
I know Magnus has Rúngne, but he should start a Chalk Army brand (cult?) with Geekclimber is his first convert.
Geek Climber: I don't use chalk Magnus: I'm chalked
I feel like I'm watching magnus and opposite magnus.  (magnus uses chalk and shirtless, geek uses no chalk and shirted)
When I think of LA I think homeless everywhere and terrible policy’s that ruined the state over the course of years. But yeah some people also think of celebrities and the beach… until they explore the place and leave with a different impression.
Wait a sec was that Derek in the background filming for GeekClimber? He's cheating on Brandon with other Youtubers uh oh.. jk
It was super fun climbing with you, Magnus! Thanks again for the collab, and thanks for showing me the power of chalk 😆!
Gotta chalk, my dude!  The few anti chalk people I've met are usually just elitists as if they don't use specialized shoes and other gear to make climbing easier.
good climbs
Magnus met anti-Magnus
Nice! Geek climber is the best! :P
only found your channel through the Alex Honnold video but I've gone back and watched a lot of them, thank you for such great content!
Chalk addiction 😅
watching magnus easily flash the v8 after geekclimber struggles on it is crazy just shows how godly a climber magnus is
Have you had a chance to check out Vertigo Boulders or Cliffs of Id? Those are also both touchstone gyms and I am curious on your thoughts on them
On coaching: I remember a different video where magnus also gave weaker climbers something too hard for them, sadly again they went straight to v8 with geek climber to keep the format, instead of trying v7.
that geek climber never climbed with chalk blew my mind
The moment he shows how the average climber would fail even to hold the first hold that magnus flashes without much of a hassle... Damn...
Hey Magnus you are looking leaner again. Leaner as in more mascular just low body fat percentage. Did you loose the weight or just your body did a recomposition on its own and dumped extra fat and kept the muscle.
Awesome video!!!
I've never seen Geek Climber smile this hard! Like a dream come true :-D
Honestly, the setting looked very 'the same move 5 times' rather than a varied boulder, lacking some creativity maybe, slightly disappointing, but maybe it's just the selection of boulders filmed
The nails scratching the wall is so shocking to me every time... whenever my nails touch the wall they get so jagged and messed up, so I have to keep em short. How are your nails able to cope?!
Enjoying the US tour! You should link up with Juji again!
chalk vriginity lost! another great video Magnus!! Love it!
OMG I REMEMBER THE VIDEO WHERE JASON WAS INSPIRED BY HIM TO WORK OUT!!!  this is really magical
Never ever even been climbing but love watching this channel so much, very calming.
I get that you are shocked, but are you also chalked?
let's goooooooooo
Magnus, I love the new interview-style black background! So professional and clean--keep up the great work!
61st
amazing vid, love to see people come to my city. the production quality is also great!
My home gym!! Super cool seeing you guys here on all the familiar boulders
Fun tidbit, Jared Leto climbs at that gym and he’s really good, can climb v8-v9 I believe
Very soft problem grading. 7A/7A+ in our gyms are extremely hard.
Has Magnus found a new follower for his chalk-cult? :x
It’s cool to see you climbing my local gym!
Hei Magnus, can you build a gym in my hometown? LOL Cool to see a new face on the channel.
Magnus V15 Boulder Challenge 💪😎
Hollywood boulders is a Touchstone gym which tend to be soft
When I think of LA I think of drugs, riots, gangs, more riots, homeless people, more drugs, gay people, and a lot more homeless people.
Like for best format. But where is the worst gym?
When you think of LA you might think of movies and celebrities. But the city is also filled with geeks.
This looks so fun
Du lager veldig bra videoer😄👌
Magnus " i dont know what i'm doing" Midtbo
looking leaner these days
What a bloody lovely duo
The collab I always needed and finally got ! <3
Come to Long Beach Rising. It’s all bouldering comp gym. Super cool climbs!
Cliffs of Id is great, too
Saw this video uploaded while at the climbing gym. Best way to spend a rest period.
Hi Magnus,  Just wanted to point out that few of your recent videos look so well edited that it feels like it should be on some paid streaming service. I am grateful that this quality content is available on a free platform like YouTube  Thank you for this.
328th like! 37th comment! This video was awesome!
omfg was not expecting this Collab
a collab with the homie @geekclimber?? this is dope
MY fingers are like Magnus thats so weird
how long will you be in the US?
💯
Another great collaboration! If you're game, maybe hit up Matt Fultz and come out to Boise for another collab!
Magnus, you always inspire me, can't wait to watch this video!
Always love seeing you going to different gyms all over the world. Great to see you back in the states!
It's great to see you Magnus, this video is great. I would really love to see you make another great video with the Marines at Camp Pendleton I really liked watching you with Staff Segeants Bickel And Chavez. (Very Impressive)
Nice! Looks like a fun collab.  Glad you got him to use chalk!

Awesome collab

" I don't climb with chalk".   "That's so surprising" lol :D
Hey Magnus! Awesome video and I love the new content you’ve been making! When you came to my home gym (Pacific Pipe) it was SO cool. Just letting you know you always lift my mood and I can assure you that you lift many other peoples moods too. Keep going dude!
I love your travel videos and collaborations 🤙
The collab we didn’t know we need, but the one we need.
Any collab with Ludwig in the works?
When i think of LA I think homeless people,tents,crack pipes, needles, and poop
Yeah a great gym ! Live across the street would recommend but watch out for parking lol it’s Hollywood
Been waiting for this collab! 😍 I got a chance to climb with Geek Climber and he's the nicest guy out there. You've been busy with the editing Magnus! Keep up the awesome content!
I love your content bro. Please keep it up as long as you love doing it 😁. Thanks for making me smile.
A new video !
Yes! New content <3 i dont know how people climb without chalk
