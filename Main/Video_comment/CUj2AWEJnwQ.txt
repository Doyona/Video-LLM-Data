God bless you. The Lord talks to me. He pinches my body and twitches my eyelids and fingers. Jesus loves you 🩷✝️ God told me pastor John lomacang is the elected high priest.
Это называется " пела"?  Жесть...хриплым голосом речитативила, крутила задом, хлопала накладными ресницами, показывала искусственные зубы...певица, мляяяяя
Wow, this is rough to listen to and to watch as well.

Actual question. How do these plus size woman like Nicki and Cardi B not have cellulite?   Wondering if there is something they are doing in post video processing to hide it. Normally people that thick have it so I'm curious.

She basically still mad about that Nicki feature so she trying to send a message to nicki.

Now im going to send you a snippet. Tell me what you think Nicki i want you to drop a verse."  Nicki': "child get up out my DM! You're not getting a feature from me, child.... poof! be gone! Wither away ! 🥀dry up waiting, cause it aint coming! Lets see how them genes gone do in 2 more years"  Latto: "i did nothing wrong to you."  *cries 😢

I'm sick of people playing clips of an older song on repeat, then rapping over it and saying "I wrote a song."   No you didn't.  You wrote a poem, and spoke it while playing a clip of an actual song on repeat in the background.
🎶🎶🎶
I really enjoyed this song
Loving how Nicki, the original Barbie toned it down to let Ice Spice shine with that Barbie look.  She's like, let me let you shine, they already know the OG

Barbie is white though
Zon’t zo it😂😂
This is by far the worst sound that's ever entered my eardrums. Not only do you not have to sing well to make music, in this age, you don't even have to speak very well.
13:09
I love omg 😂
Barbie 😭😭😭😭😭 qu'est-ce que l'anglais c'est quel français
God this was so low effort, looking back. They clearly just scrambled for a song a month before release. Quick, get uhhhh *throws dart* Nicki Minaj and uhhhh... *throws another* Ice Spice. Speed up the Aqua song by 15%, then get ChatGPT to write some gibberish they can splutter out in a triplet rhythm. Boom, done. Wait, we need a music video? Ehhh, just plagiarise all their other videos and make it pink or something, I don't care. Make them Barbies or something. Nice.
Yall ar the best singer ever to exist not Taylor swift or Olivia Rodrigo🤬
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pink hair looks good on you and ice spice 💖

Ez az Aqva: Barbiegirl című  híres slágerének plagizálása szerintem. Lene Grawford Nystrøm /Aqua/ híres norvég énekesnő hangjára épül fel az egész szám,&  a Rapszöveg is nagyon gagyi. Ez a szám egy nagy nulla. !Úgy kéne művészien rappelni mint Mc Lyte,Queen Latifah vagy Left Eye !!!

Hi Nikki, of course I don’t know you except from you being famous. But when I was in prayer last week, God told me to pray for you. And I’ve been praying for you ever since because he said that you belong to Him.   This week he said to tell you to come out from amongst them. He said that he wants you from now until you leave here to cause people to come to Him and to see Him not you! He said that He wants your music to reflect Him not you! He said it’s time to sing to me and sing for me!   He said there is a song that you created when you were little that you used to sing to me it’s time for that song to be produced and for the world to hear it! It is time for you to come out from amongst them and bring people to Me! This is the word of the Lord to you! I love you! Mo

Say what you want about Ice Spice now but she KILLED her part. These are the type of beats that are for her. The way she flows on these beats are insane! Teach her how to write better lyrics and she’s set!

seeing the cmts talk abt how they thought nikki was actually invited by the director.. ice spice is the one who got the deal and reached out to nikki so she could collab n work on it together T_T ice spice talked abt it when it was released they they had an argument via her friend leaking texts lol

The fact that this song it placed at the end of a left-leaning movie that's suppose to be about children and self-imagery. Something is incredibly wrong with Americans.

It’s wild to me that apparently they reached out to Ice Spice for this song and Ice was the one who got Nicki to be apart of it??? According to Ice anyways. Why wouldn’t they reach out to Nicki instead of Ice? So weird.
1st October 2024🎀
I still can't believe that Ice Spice actually said that she's the reason Nicki Minaj was apart of this barbie collab 😂😂

Ice Spice could never carry this song on her own. I wonder what she would have done. Sure, she invited Nicki, but Nicki is the more popular, relevant, talented artist.

Quelle honte d'attacher un caractère si érotique aux traditionnelles poupées Barbie !!!

Growing up I was a Barbie girl I always wanted everything to be of Barbie on every birthday I asked for Barbie doll or Barbie house 💖
All these years Barbie has been white Nicki is the only one with the balls to say I’m Black Barbie 😆
Trash
What a terrible version. Urbanized is so ghetto and gross.
Aqua so stupefied 😢
Life in plastic

Hey guys, is anyone here in June 2024= and if you go back to one of her old songs on Ariana Grande’s thing, like page 7 years ago, she has a song called side to side, and on Nicki Minaj’s part, there is Barbie men

I love it
Yea
Yes
SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS BY HERSELF NO ICE SPICE
Nicki slay and ice spice slayy you all baides
Here's your clue: if you don't know who Jazzy or the wonderful world of Shanii is then you dont even know what shes talking about. She comes from the 90s generation the last of the good Barbz, not this generation with hard legs that don't bend, shyty hair, 💩 clothes, period. If mattel really wanted Nicki, & Nicki really wanted the Barb community, she woulda told mattel to change their legs back but na, she not all about that.

After the problems with the shows in Manchester I have to say that based on this the fans have missed nothing. Probably the worst thing I have ever heard in a very, very long time.  No talent.  No originality. No nothing. What am I missing? Must be my age as sure isn't my ears!

Nicki is such a lyrical genius. I’m just realizing when she said “I’m a doll but I still wanna party” it sounds like “I’m older but I still wanna party.   Cuz they stay coming for her age. Well done Nicki

I always thought this was a Nicki minaj song featuring ice spice, cos how they structured the song and Nicki outshined her. Ice voice was just blah & not expressive, nothing star quality how she sounded rapping.

I really like ice.... but I mainly replay NICKI. She has an energy and vibe you can't deny and her flow is EVERYTHING
Man too bad they didn't have Iggy Azalea on this.  She's so much better than Minaj, she could really learn how to improve her flow.
I listening to this sing when i was 16 at school😢😂❤
This song reminds me of 90s skating rings
Me watching this at 2024 makes me cry cause it reminds me of August 2023 when barbie came out😢😢😢😢😢
❤❤❤
WAT A TUNE

salute the QUEENZ
{wow this music remind me alot of memories, my stay in Romania was so fun and motivating. My financial life transformed greatly as I met an old friend in Romania who introduced me to online trading and investment. I started investing in assets that earns me monthly passive income and now I got 4 out of my 5 goals. Just hope it encourages someone's that it doesn’t matter if you dont have any knowledge right now, you can start TODAY regardless your age INVEST and change your future! Investing in the financial market is a grand choice I made.;}✓✓✓
Where can I find these dolls my daughters “ really want this ❤ if there for sell I can buy them 200 are there collectible and not for sale I’ll buy them both for 250$dollars

This song rocks me 😋😝 amazing hit 😍
nicki singing a feminist song for a feminist movie is kinda ironic
this is an ad for olie pop within a soundtrack to promote a movie based a doll
👍❤️
I am a fan of nick Minaj go nick Minaj and ice

So basically black music in 2024 is just stealing music from previous generations and just shouting over the top of them incoherently?
Ice Spice looks WEIRD.

Slayyyyy🩷🛍👛🎀💝😘
｡✧*.｡My life lesson｡✧*.｡:: I've stopped listening to music that have -too much words in-, which have improved my life fr. Ppl don't really think about how much music actually impact our thoughts, like majority of the lyrics are negative and toxic (same goes with TV-series/shows and movies ). I hope this helps someone who’s stuck with toxic music.  Toxic things/people are just distractions which distracts us from our true purpose here on earth - to live and learn, learn from our mistakes and therefore make this world better and SAFER. Peace and love.
i watched the barbie movie and it had this song at the end i love that they added it
Yass Quueennn! Lol I love u so much Nicki ❤️❤️

Slayyyyyyy
Im sorry im not feeling the nicki and ice spice collab. Just seems like nicki has to hold back her talent for this girl to shine. Nicki is a queen and if you cant level up to her or at least try then you dont need to be on her tracks. But thats just my opinion.
Barbie can’t be a black girl
Nicki Minaj  ans ICe Spice beautiful
The best
Slay girls sorry, set up. Amma, what are you wrong? I think I'm slay because I'm papika. OK, your song is pretty spider. Like your song is pretty fire like A? Like I love you song. Did you have a Mick wonderful? Are you a Mercury that you're on stage like a little stage?❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I literally just sent that you 20 mean. I send it to 22 hearts.

As an adult it’s an ok song I do like Nicki Minaj she’s made some pretty good songs ice spice naaa not my type… but I’m curious was this movie and song intended to be for kids? Because it is inappropriate for kids…. I find it really inappropriate and weird not really cute or princess like how real Barbie has always been but … okay for adults I guess

Yeah Ice you are a 10
I can't stand the voice on Ice spice.
The fact that aqua was even ok with this is kind of disappointing. Needing money will make a sell-out out of anyone

So- René Dif (original singer of Ken’s voice in Aqua’s Barbie girl) actually said he liked this song more than his own which is honestly hilarious to me.   This is second hand information so take it with a huge grain of salt, comes through his wife who works with my dad and that’s how I learned it-
Black Paris Hilton gone wrong 🎉😮

That was Bad My Girl the One & Only@ Nicki Minaj❤🎉
Nicki Minaj, you're the Barbie of the rap game, and nobody can touch you. You have the style, the skills, and the attitude to dominate the charts and the hearts of your fans. You're not afraid to speak your mind, to challenge your rivals, and to show off your assets. You're a slay queen, and you know it. You inspire millions of people to embrace their inner Barbie and to live their best lives. You're a legend, a icon, and a queen. Nicki Minaj, you're the Barbie, like slay queen!!
The video 👍👍
Who's ready for Tour? Barbzzzzzz!!!!!!!
All of these 90s rap/pop remakes are corny.
RUINED
I love. Them 😇
Well, that's 2:10 of my life I'm never getting back. Anyone got a link to a video of nails screeching on a chalkboard? I need something with better melody 🤮
She perfect! I’m so excited for Ice. Unique sound, refreshing for the pop world.
This was the song that Margot Robbie wanted to put up a nod and a homage to the original Aqua Barbie Girl song in order to avoid copyright tensions with Mattel
❤hum l love nicko❤❤
Dear person, Jesus loves you beyond measure! He has a plan a purpose for your life he sees your struggles and your pain and hurt!   Ask him to reveal himself to you he died for you he loves you!   That Jesus died for us, loves us and that eternal life is a free gift.  1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,
Nicki is the ultimate example of manifestation.

Nicki Minaj reinvented Barbie image onto herself and she’s literally a Barbie. She’s such a talented entertainer. It sucks to see her degrading her career the way she’s doing it.

To anybody who's reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life.

Ice spice and nicki Minaj are on fire
Abomination. These puppets are leading generations to the slaughter, despair and an empty life.
trash music
barbie is nt a %&hre bt niki is
I🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ice spice and Nike menagi😮😢😂❤❤
When Barbie first came out did they actually have African Barbie’s
i made this song.
Fortnite song but add drill remix
According to google, google said that brunette is the prettiest so… sorry❤❤❤❤
I had the barbie pool you could pump circa 1985 Malibu Barbie! ….
Aint she 40?
???????????.
Yo my classmate who’s a boy lowkey looks like her (You know who you are MJ.)
It's heart warming to see that special needs kids now have their own music❤
As women become liberated, the world becomes a better place for most men.
This is a terrible song. They absolutely butchered the original.
This is not music. It’s garbage
Aaaa
If anything, I'm suprised this was allowed in a family film
Ice spice definitely looks better in straight hair not her orange afro puff
Gutter trash.
3 billion fathers pray for assistance
Bloody awful haha
hard
Love YOU nicki ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes
I luv you and ice spice you guys the best ever❤

this is so bad.. the best part of the song is the background sample xD

Noooo! The full original version of the song by the Danish group Aqua should have been used. And to think Mattel sued Aqua for trademark infringement years ago, but now Mattel is using Aqua's song for the movie.
Such a wholesome song for young children to be influenced by 😵‍💫

Boooooring. Cheap. Waste of time.
FLOPNIKAAA
Barbie 👄💞🦩🍭🎠🏩
Does the Grammys change the names of the winners after intimate relationships or receive fresh money? It is a confusing question, and at the same time everyone knows the answer to it.
Nicki minaj is the queen of rap with the grammy or without
Mwah💋 no Grammys 😅
This is the Grammy win for 2023 best rap song. To the world.
Boycott Grammys this needs justice.
"We got bars but we ain't bailing out"
Should've won a Grammy, disappointed but not suprised
🔥🔥🔥🔥CAME HERE AFTER THE SCAMMYS PLAYED ON THIS SONG 🔥 THE REAL WINNER
F the Grammy!!! Nicki Minaj Still The Queen Of Rap 🔥🔥🔥
Run it up ❤❤ for the Queen 👑  f the grammy awards
We love you Nicki❤
Una canción plana de mierda, no sé qué le ven como para nominarla al grammy
Queeen
Probably changed their mind after she dissed Meg lol
Nossas Barbies nao precisam de grammy pra serem valorizadas
Grammy foi sujo
Queen
LOVE YOU NICKI 💜💜💜@NICKIMINAJ  "And to my core fans, keep reppin' me Do it to the death of me 'X' in the box, cause ain't nobody checkin' me"
Barbz! Let's push this song again since they played her dirty at the scammies.
THE REAL GRAMMY WINNING SONG
Who is here after this monumental injustice that the Grammys just did to Nicki? 😢
Scammys
Who's here after the Grammy??🥲😥😪
The Grammys are disgusting
Grammy e muito sujo
Ese Grammy era tuyo mi reina lástima que siempre esos premios son comprados:(
The way the Grammys played in their face is disgusting 😢. Barbie World won that award but they lied it was a mistake. She's been saying the truth about them for years
Null
Grammy Winner... Congratulations
Congrats Queen on your Grammy win 🏆 🎀
If Nicki don’t get this Grammy for this song with spice like omggg❤❤❤ Queen of Rap
Nicki is a Killah 🤚💚
You wear Chanel, gold jewelry, "so cool," but you can't order good graphics. This graphics makes me puke.
Lol

Very cool song, I wish you continued success and a beautiful day and have a beautiful weekend and have a great week, God help everyone and many greetings from Romania 💙💛❤️🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩

What a strange ending to the movie… they cut to a MAGAt Trumper to close out an otherwise-great film???  (Make it make sense…)
Lets make nicki win her first ever grammy award

Too bad Nicki and Ice Spice ruined a nostalgic and higher quality song by Aqua. To think Mattel was turned off by Aqua's rendition, yet this trash is acceptable? WTH?

I've got my pink
What are you doing to that nasty little girl. Nicki you’re like 50 why are u hanging out w a confused 14 yr old? So gross
Give up
ANY1 HERE IN 2024??
Woo! Girl power! Femanism! 1:11 and 1:35 And just remember that this catchy song has this video behind it whenever your watching it with your family! (Why did it have to be so sexualized 😂 I mean, I get it its fun its funny but its just so sexualized undertones in the video! This is actually a good song! why does everysecond have to have a twerk?!) Also 1:00 is that a product placement in an add about a product placement? Theres 2 leveles of product placement in this! We are on Addam Sandler-Michal Bay product placement levels here peopel!! AND AnOTHER different one at 1:31! H-how much could this thirsty video have cost to make?!
Im here from the Em n MGK AI cover
Nicki Minaj and Ice spice has a big a$$
Go barbie
Can you please pin my request,please make a new song in Febuary
Although this is clearly NOT the Barbie brand, I do like how they were OK to modernize it and bring Barbie to different demographics.
I love illumi queens. When will i join you?❤
Barbie Girl
Ken is a guy who is worth 10 K. Granted I'm just a Broke Joe
Nicki had to teach her how to flow to the song, lol

The “SLAYYYY” at the end😂
She's so artificial😢and fake....
This song is not nearly long enough!!!!
yes 0024
🌷🌸Pretty and cute❤💞
Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus. Sin feels great, but in the end it leads to death(eternal separation from God in the pit of fire) God loves you so much and wants you to turn to Him. He will change you. The world gives you (temporary happiness)but in the end you are  feeling emptiness and wanting more of something , but it can never fill that hole in your heart and depression. Once you taste Jesus He will be all you ever want in your life and you will have His peace and joy in any situation if you allow Him to be Lord of your life. Life is so short and your never know whens your last day on earth, don't play Russian roulette with your soul. Eternity is forever.. Just call out to Jesus for Him to help you. If you love your sin , just ask Jesus to help you hate it, just be real with Him (but respectful ofcourse) and pour out your heart. Love you all

Does ice spice actually have downs looks like it regardless
Nicky has always being a barbie
It's chinna!!!
Boring
I love ice spice so much ❤❤❤❤
I loved how the original united everyone. It didnt matter if you liked pop, rock, rom coms or horror. We all agreed that song was awesome. This version got most of us to agree, this is trash.   The original had objectification, but that objectification derived from consent and the enjoyment of everyone involved. This remake embodies exactly the opposite of what feminists took from the original. Subjectification and subservience by one party. Now qlmost no one likes this trash
We need the barbie remix with lil wayne
These visuals are FIREEEEE

Isn't Nicki Minaj 43
Esto es una movie
When you wouldn't believe that there could be more plastic in a music video than in a movie about Barbie, these two appear making a version of Aqua's Barbie Girl, which I think could be quite improved.
NICKI DOES NOT LOOK 41😭

Nicki is the real Barbie
Felizzzz navidad 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amoooo a estás mujeres❤❤❤
Love me some nikki
All of them are Barbies😒
It's amazing that she made a song for the movie! (slay!) but we all know she should've played a role in the MOVIE!
this song would've been better if they left out the original Aqua vocals, but rapping over that iconic catchy chorus' vocals makes it sound messy.
Nicky is not a barbie giyl she is a getto girl
Whoa kiff la prod le song c'est juste impeccable
This song blows compared to the original
If you hear the background melody superficially u will find that it resembles a melody from one of Doja Cat songs
Ain’t no real man working most of his life trying to find nasty 🤮 women like these.

I honestly thought this was for kids. I got nothing against the way they dress, it's all about how present yourself.
What I want to know is if the Barbie Necklace here is the same one Nicki has HAD. Remember Bed Rock by Young Money? Nicki was wearing a Barbie necklace in that music video

Bro I hate this
Yes Queens. Been waiting for this collabo forever. I heard this song on the radio one day and was wondering who sing this song. I knew Nicki Minaj was in it by the sound of her flow.
Толстая барби, вот такое название вроде
This has to be one of the laziest work I've seen. Just pasted Aqua's track, lowered the volume under her track and called it a day.
I love yous so much

Ахуенно❤❤
Go ICE Spice and Nicki Minaje that is fire🔥🔥🔥
If trash was a song.....
That's the albino Nicki
ICE SPICE needs a spray tan bcuz she bleached her skin too light...now you need a tan gurl lol
Pink Barbie❤🌺
Ummm not impressed
is this the end of capitalism?
2 minutes? Jesus ok lol
nicki after Over a DECKADE still killing it and looks so ever young still
this was awful
this is trash
💅
🌷🎀🎉💝🦄
yo the eye rolls at 0:49 remind me of the old nicki
This is straight garbage
They never let them on screen for more than a second because then you’ll see they’re below average 😂
Wow they both garbage.. Ice spice even more though.. Industry plant.
Nicki minaj
Idk who the girl with the stand off ish stank attitude is with the pink highlights but minus her dead energy the other girls are def a vibe!!!!! Great energy ❤
why do all Nickis vids look the same.
L song
Ok
Di lol iiirskokoip
Can we address the fact that I spice not only raps, but looks like she is on the spectrum? Her delivery on almost every one of her “bars” is atrocious and forced. If she was a 5 foot nothing white chick rapping like this, she would get roasted but because she’s got a little bit of body people think she’s the truth.
😍
I’d say Nicki is as fake and plastic as Barbie. So her singing is pretty accurate.
Well they both are made of plastic
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely zero talent at all. She just slurs words she didn't right in the exact same cadence on every song.
Mmm meh
Bro the beat is the same tho it’s @$$ and the music has no meaning at all, nobody tried. The music video is the only reason that people like it. Go to the hub for that $#!T
If only female rappers could not rap about there body’s for once
Sup Lil mama
Those Hoes want to be WH*T S0000000 bad. lol  It will never happen!
The song is iconic but the music video didn't reach my expectations.
110m 🩷
She actually made ice spice actually spice up her rap a little more ☝️☝️☝️☝️
gyatt
Let's not forget to big up "Ice Spice"😊 cause her rapping is incredibly. They both did a great job. I'm addicted to this song lol 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

THIS SONG HITS DIFF ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL
Ice better warch oit they finnatake her head off
It was only right 😌 and I loved both their verses 🎉
Sorry, it's a good song on it's own, but it's not for the Barbie movie. AQUA was ment for the Barbie movie. Sad that Mattel still holds beef... 😢 I don't denie that this song is good, but the lyrics is not suitable for this film...

Queens made a hit with a drill-pop beat iconic.
The cringest kids I've ever heard. " SLAY". " ITS GIVING...".
Barbie is a children's toy so why would you have anything sexually explicit in this I think they should be ashamed because there is and can be a better version normally Nikki does music no one can top this one you xan top it.
Barbie💗💗💖
Queens
How people can like this garbage? You really need to be illetarete.
Acho que vai ser difícil alguém fazer outra música no tema Barbie e superar essa. Aquela bomba da Aqua tentou 😂
Movie of Barbie was a major disappointment.

I am All About Jesus,• let me tell you how the Catholic Church teaches wrong ways, Pagan worship demonic. They Worship Angels, And fake images in Statue form of a false Jesus, on the Cross still, though it is a false image of Jesus, it’s a image of a dead graven image a idol, and a false image of Mary, the Saints & Angels, it’s Forbidden to do that, it’s Idol. NO IMAGES 🚫‬‬ 🔥(Exodus,20:3-7) “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.”🔥(Leviticus,26:1) “Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.”🔥(Psalm,78:58) “For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images."🔥(1Corinthians,10:14) “Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.”🔥(Colossians,2:18) “Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,”‬‬🔥(Deuteronomy,4:19)“And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.”NIV🔥(Revelation,9:20) “And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:”🔥KJV‬‬     •NO IDOLS.

Would y'all take shrooms with me? 😅😹😉😎🎩
Great Song The Rap Version Nicki Minaj Made Is So Much Better Than The Original One Aqua Made Is Boring.
Due to Aqua's "Barbie Girl" literally taking over the airwaves two and a half decades ago, I feel fairly confident in saying that this #BarbieWorld song is probably far more "special" to those of us who grew up in the nineties than it is to younger generations.  Like a lot of folks back then, I really tried to hate it and totally failed. And, even at 38, I still get low-key excited anytime I hear the intro:  "Hiya, Barbie!" "Hi, Ken!" "You want to go for a ride?" "Sure, Ken!" "Jump in!"  And yeah, I'm ashamed AF that I've still got it memorized. 😂
The b word
Slay
The legit queen 👑👑 and princess of rap and barbie world..❤❤ no  confirmation required...💅
Why is there more boys than girls why?

Ereyone is crazy with her because she is the cutest girl in the world boys no.

Is this a Barbie parody or a 2001: A space Odyssey parody
This is random but i listened to Ice Spice's bit in acapella and combined it using the music from the last part of 7 rings. Let me tell you it sounds really good!
I love you so much

Sono rifatte talmente tanto che faticano a parlare e cantano a rallentatore...fantastico
Nicki has been singing about being a Barbie since the beginning of her career and now she has actually made a song for the actual Barbie film 😧😧
ITS GIVING MAKE OVER that got me laughing hard
Why is ice spice in the boys are lair and now she is in the BARBIE world?
When they was driving in the clouds that was LITT
Best colab eva

She said I’m in New York Madison ave and I live in Madison ave
A collab I thought would be too good to be true, guess I was wrong...
Does ice have Down syndrome?
Vari good nicki ana ice ❤

Favorite Girls
Nicki replaced 69 with Ice Spice 😂😂😂  Tell me I'm wrong for saying Ice Spice is the female 69
I'm so happy Ice is Queen Barbie approved 😭😭😭
ELLES ONT DEAD
The Barbie Girl song is literally about an older guy coming on to a little girl. Listen to the words. Did her husband pick the Barbie Girl sample?
This song is a fantastic blend of nostalgia and contemporary style.
OMG  its so cool❤❤❤❤❤❤
اقسم بالله انها هي وياها يجيبون القرف☺️
I fn love nikki she's fn gorgeous.  I would do anything she wanted me to do I would love to eat all day. Just being honest I know everyone is thinking it. Nobody can top gorgeous nikki I wish I could meet her ❤
The way nicki has been rapping about being barbie and now she's singing for the actual barbie movie that's crazy 😂
The OG Barbie
BOOOOOOOOORINGG!
Gyattttttttttt
Anyone seen what Nicki and Cardi b look like without makeup🤮
YAY i love Barbie!!!!!!
Wish I hadn't delayed my comment 😢😢
I love em BOTH in the video, but Nicki looks SO PRETTY with her pig tails!!!   😍💕🦄
I 💕 this! ☺️
Every  tiktok and ever ig reel literally everywhere on this planet plays this song. This one sold the movie in my opinion.  The other's  are ok too.
Be a grammy winning song❤
Destroying all what is Barbie... ahm... ok.
Did Olipop Soda really pay for an AD in this
Big love
She kinda reminds me of doja cat before she got famous
❤ love those barbi videos it is so awesome and great 😊😂😮
1:54 I see Fashionistas 198, 199, and 209 in this background! I have those dolls!
This is what happens when hookers become singers 😂
ngl my 2 cm defeater is bricke\

Nicki is incredibly humble. She's opened so many doors!! Extremely talented and successful. Beautiful. Hard working. And she just basks in the ambiance. Queen doesn't need clarification she already knows 👑 ❤
"I'm a doll, but I still wanna party" Nicki is way too cute ❤
I hope this song gets Nicki her first Grammy! As well as nomination for an Oscar!
lol
LOVE❤❤

Barbie n'est pas si gâtée comme vous cette chanson est très nul pour vous et ce que vous portez c'est très moche

I don't listen rap that often but that girl deserves a grammy come on. She's queen of rap.
First an artist trying to get heard. And now she's on top.
ate 💋
This is garabage compared to the original   Without the sample of the aqua hook this wouldnt be anything special   Hip hop and pop not blending well together here
Salut

This song is fire bro!

Ice Spice has Down Syndrome? I'm proud of her. Despite her disability she did ok for herself
Much love 😘💕💕😘 baby
Niki you better give me back my Barbie diamond necklaces chain you stoled out my luxurious Fashion Closet. You are a wholesome treasure thief for stealing from luxury brands and being a fake artist. You are not a Barbie princess doll remember you were disappointed because, you were exposed for stealing from toys “R” Us in Trinidad 🇹🇹 you were kicked out of your country.  You had to move to Queens bridge NY for punishment. People are writing a all tell story book about your fake lifestyle and it’s someone who you didn’t pay money for the work they did for you, and you mistreated them in the public eye in-front of your ROC government nation family members lol.
I’m still watching Barbie World on YouTube even after it reached 100 million views. Who else is still here?
❤❤❤🎉🎉
You two sound soooooooooo familiar❤😂

This song isn't nearly long enough! I love it. @nickiminaj has been talking about being Barbie for her entire career. How anyone would still be in doubt is beyond me. Nicki = Barbie!

Had expected something with way more hype, bravado, some pull to it. This is just the same melody and beat throughout whole song. Just same 4x beat on repeat. The lyrics are sub par at best, I expected better and more from this duo because they don't genuinely produce something so generic. Nicki has way more talent than beat provides at same time ice spice is held down by beat and not allowed growth. This song is just unimpressive. It's as low key slow song with no emotion.  I've tried to listen to it for a different response
Barbie is back nicki minaj
Call of duty added you for operator in modern warfare

J'aime la voix de Spice quand elle fait du rap
Wauf wauf wauf wauf wauf wauf🐕🐕🐶🐶🐶
🤡💩
i love barbie bich❤
This is getting old i feel like she hasn't evolved at all the last decade she seems to latch onto younger artists. If you were to tell me the song came out 7 years ago without I spice I believe you it sounds so bad like every other Nicki Minaj song
Favorite song of all time
This song just seems like sexualized trash. Ironic considering that matel tried to sue aqua over claiming their song sexualized barbies all those years ago.... then they come out with this.... Shouldve just used aquas. This song has the worst role models for children. Especially girls. Absolutely horrible choice. Gross.
Bop bop bop bop bop hit hit hit hit
Yoooo😂😂
Okay .. in the second part of the Video that gurl goes dinner with me.
I can't be the only one who thinks this is just hot garbage.
As a producer, this track is produced so well.
you can make bank by being dumb?
I love ice spice but f!ck the other one
NICKIE IS SO FUCKINTG SEXY
Not the oli pop ad 🤦🏼‍♀️
Niki and ice are an AMAZING rap duo
I love how each artist made the barbie concept their own.

The fact that her whole career and entity is about Barbie and pink, and yet she was not asked to make a cameo or appear in the actual movie is a CRIME.

Ppl wish they had these fans. Drop them bombs and I’m on AMP for you and all Barb channels xo xo. Take over Baby!

2 months later, #27 on top music videos in Canada! CATCH IT!!!!
garbage
Movie completely went over their heads didnt it.. hate how the popstars who featured in the soundtrack are all the problematic ones that arent sticking up for feminism and just feeding into the male gaze. So contradictory. Since this was made for the barbie movie, why is it not actually an empowering video? Why is it still just them being sexualised and dressing/acting for the male gaze? This the whole point of the movie and its done nothing. Saddening. Everyones brainwashed just like in the movie.
I wish this song went on way longer it's so good
I'm sorry 2023 I need to back😓 2009
Nice 👍 is pink

eu goste, essa musica ficou demais
Nicki how are you girl, the best barbie b!tch❤❤
you dont know me miguel 👌
Yes Nicki 🎉
like got me stacy nicki all the barbies are pretty
I wish they didn't play the old barbie song in the background for the whole song. It's kind of distracting and makes it hard to hear what they're saying.
13 years plus  Nicki Minaj in bedrock as Black Barbie girl you always been a Barbie Girl Nicky
Just listen to this with ur eyes closed, imagin them rapping this in the mic at the studio... ain't no way you think they put any effort in thus sht 😂
nice queen
I am 7 and I don’t really like this song, but can you guess what my favorite song is?only with Chris Brown and you
Hi
as melhores
So.  Col
Oh my GYAT what a song
NIKI YOU SLAY
The original is better.  Reminder that Aqua got sued by Mattel for the Barbie Girl song.
Aqua ghost adventures 🎉
Oh my God Nikki, I love you so much I wish I could meet you in real life. I’m a big fan of you oh my gosh
Теперь вы знаете что слушают мои соседи перед окончательным оглушением
The only good thing about the Barbie movie.
wow!
🤑🏩wow yay
Barbie summer!
Isn’t barbie aimed at little girls,what’s this woman on. She’s nasty
Slay girl💅💅
Nicki 😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤
ALL NICKI FANS HERE!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥 you are beautiful & amazing
Yeahhhh nicki 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Slay❤
Video is mediocre
I don’t see why the world is gassing Ice Spice up. She can’t rap and has a boring monotoned voice in every song and interview, she has no personality, and all of her songs and flows sound the same.
Nobody even hit the doll eye
🔥🔥🔥
Nicki Minaj in this Video= 100% Original  100% Raw and Natural Talent  100% Versatility 100% Lyrically 100% Visually Beautiful 100% Queen 👑👑🦄🦄
Nicki Minaj= Makes History ♥ Nicki Minaj= Iconic Legend 👏 Nicki Minaj =Lyrical Genius 💯 Nicki Minaj= Queen of Rap 👑 Nicki Minaj= Original Barbie 🩷
This song will never get old! My 88 years old grandpa used to always tell me how much he loved this song as a teen & he & his friends used to listen to this during WW2 to motivate them to stay alive!! Ice spice & Nicki Minaj you are icons❤️!
100 million views nearly letz go barbz 🎉
the end is everythingg “omgsh this is perfect! SALAYYYY”
Nicki's verse has more iconic lines and her first part before the flow switch is great too. (It's Barbie bxtch if you still in doubt is the most iconic line.) Ice Spice's flow switch is also great, I love how chilled she is. Both verses are a 10.
Прекрасное звучание трека и минуса.
If you like nicki Minaj. Like and subscribe.
Slay bestie❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤❤❤

Nikki and ice spice do really be slayying
You can be the king but watch the queen conquer 👑👑👑 I love that Nicki is still out here after 15 years making great music 🎶 and looking more beautiful than ever ❤❤ Nobody has anything on her 🦄🦄  Nicki absolutely is the original barbie and definitely deserves recognition for that🩷🩷 Love you so much Queen 👑👑👑
No ghost writers. No gimmicks. No Clout chasing. No Payola. No Sympathy. Just pure raw talent and devoted fans. She definitely deserves her flowers and recognition for all her hard work!! I love you Queen!!
Nicki has her own unique way of rapping which is unlike any other artist. Plus the word play and intellectual lyrics that she puts in her personal music shows she is beyond talented but I really like the fact that Nicki Minaj choose to change up her style, flow, and cadence to make sure she would sound good with Ice Spice's flow while still incorporating Nicki's style as well. That shows she is very experience and versatile which is why she is the Queen!! Nicki has always been amazing with switching up her flow to match the beat or flow of the song. Nicki Minaj is undoubtably extremely versatile! I definitely believe she deserves her flowers, respect and recognition!
🎉🎉🎉
I love you can you give me that I love you more
Does Ice Spice have Down Syndrome?
Legal
💅
Шо-то эта Ice Spice как умирающий лебедь, никакого звука их себя выдавить не может, что-то шепчет еле-еле... Лучше бы Ники одна была

This is exactly what Nicki needed to get back on. I know she took a hiatus for her child, God bless. But honestly before caedi, Meghan, and all these white girls, Nicki set this trend.
So why did Nikki put this chick on, she from NY?

Funny how Mattel was mad at the original Barbie song by Aqua. They thought they sexualized Barbie in the song. Look at them now ;-) Love the song, love the Aqua sample.

I love this song
Ta refeo
First of all, so-called "Nicki Minaj" was not her real name. I think it's a disgrace and shows complete disrespect of one's heritage to change their birth name, unless when a woman gets married. If a woman gets married and DOESN'T change her last name, that shows disrespect to her husband. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the name "Onika Tanya Maraj". Most likely the change was made as a result of  from a greedy Business Manager and or Studio, in anticipation of greater recognition and subsequent monetary gain?!

Satanic behavior. Satan is using Nicki to influence evil amongst everyone. Don't allow this music to corrupt you. Turn away from sin and learn Jesus' teachings. Don't allow the evil days to come. You'll regret this one day. God loves you all so much.
I love this song❤❤❤

She wants to be a Barbie so bad , but in real life she doesn't look pretty. I already told you all she is hiding behind cameras & filters , if you see her face in real life its far away from having any beauty. Haha haha but ok. We all have seen her fans they dont have any taste of music or any talent .

Nicki should have had a cameo in the movie..just a visual
I like it
As always, taking the talent of an actual artist and throwing rap lyrics over it. So tiresome.
😂 I literally watched this on mute.

The song is a complete cacophony the way the Aqua's song is sampled here, on top of the genuinely least melodic vocals in the history of this artist.
Barbie is amazing with nicki minajlaunch and ice I love them so much I even listen to the songs
P Barbie is amazing
I love their deep voices 😭💚
I was kinda hoping to see Aqua in the video too...😢

I love nicki Minaj and I’m digging ice spice. I heard her song deli earlier and said she is giving off nicki vibes with her music and then saw they did a song together 🫶
Literally me: 💃🔥💃🔥
1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
*hanky-panky*
❤❤❤
I don’t usually like ice spice but like they are top
Seek and you will find Jesus God bless everyone. Not really any lyrics I whip my my little daughter singing don't really want her singing about having a big back and being ready to bend.
Super hits

Easily one of the worst songs I’ve ever suffered through. 0 redeeming moments, I am baffled they released this for public consumption. somebody needs to be shot for allowing this noise pollution to be recorded and the videographers responsible should be ashamed of themselves.
does she even know that she's in cod right now she's also a skin
CRINGEEEEEE
Went to see the Barbie movie, and was full of nostalgia with Aqua in the chorus in the end credits and the old Barbies from the past. The movie was great.

Every time I watch this I will definitely have to watch Princess Diana cuz why not??
She would of probably made way more money if the track wasnt so explict. 🤷🏻
And we all thought ryan was playing with them
Who is ice spice its the girl with the pink hair or the girl with black hair

Sorry Nikki but you got OLD and you look it. Just stop already and let the young one shine.   This ENTIRE production should have been Ice Spice. Nikki you had your time. You are in your 40's and you look it. When will old women comprehend that at their best, they still aren't as valuable as an average 19-22 year old.   This is just embarrassing for the old woman trying to be youthful who calls herself Nikki Minaj. Very cringe worthy. FOH 🔱 🗽
I love Barbie

Anyone else thought it was “stop playing with him ryan” 😭💀
“Omg this is perfect SLAYYYYY” at the end
80M today let's gooo!!!
The only thing Barbie about Nicki Minaj is that she’s just as plastic as the dolls🎯
So whack
I'm glad Nicki came back. It was like a 2 year stretch where an argument could have been made Nicki had the hardest bars male or female.
so catchy.
The “I’m a ten so I’m pulling a Ken” line is 🔥
Hi Barbie 👅

Barbies are skinny.
blackness overload
🔥
Can we bring modesty and feminity back in the world... where is the modesty... this is just weird... them rubbing their body parts in everyone's faces like that. Could you imagine being at the dinner table with someone's who's bits were popping out everywhere and them shaking their tata's in your face? How AWKWARD! Why are these woman so intent on shoving their bums and tata's in everyone's faces?
This is my top song on my play list
ICE SPICEEEEEE
Worst song of 2023. 😢
This theme song is better than the Barbie movie!!🙏🎼😁✅
Nickis voice! Muah! Chefs Kiss!
The old song by AQUA was way better
Nicki is crZy 😂
“And I am here to see the gynecologist”-
ᝲ
Omg Nicki Minaj Is an Operator in Warzone 2.💀💀💀 And when I play DMZ I encounter 6 Man Nicki Minaj Teams full blasting this song. 💀💀💀

طريقة عمل ماسك الفحم - جهز كمية من حبوب الفحم واطحنها حتى تصبح عبارة عن بودرة ناعمة. - يُضاف إليها القليل من الماء الساخن بالتدريج مع التقليب حتى نحصل على معجون. - يُفرد الماسك على البشرة النظيفة باستثناء منطقتي الفم والعيون، ويترك على لمدة ربع ساعة حتى يجف عليها. - تُغسل البشرة بالماء الفاتر ويكرر الماسك مرة كل أسبوع.

Im not crazy about rap but I almost always love Nicki's music. The beat in this song is sick! 💖  (Yes, I know this is nicki's version of the original barbie song. No, she didn't steal the song, she made her own version to honor the original song and the movie.)
This isn't Barbie girl this is ratchet girl😂
Nicki has an adamsapple 😂😂😂😂
Its suprising how bad this actually is, and these are meant to be popular artists, crazy
The definiton of capitalism xD :)

This is probably the single worst song of all time. For one it doesn’t even sound good for 2 it’s not creative at all and it keeps repeating the same thing over and over again, for three the lyrics are not good like I’m a ten so I’m pulling a ken anyone could come up with this so easily but no one has until now because “now” this is accepted as actual “music” which is depressing
YO WASSUP
I’m surprised hwo her family ain’t proud of her like imagine her sister and she’s hanging out with her friends in a car and this plays and her friends say “ain’t this ur sister?” LIKE ID BE MAD HYPE?
99% rubbish... An " F " for effort though
I hate Barbie
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢🎉🎉🎉🎉
Barbie world ❌ Boobie world ✅
Fast forwarded 10 throughout the whole song thinking this was the trap version for the memes..BOY WAS I WRONG..Welcome to dissapointment island with music nowadays

Garbage song
All I got to say is women☕️
My ears hurt hearing this. 1997 Aqua's original version of Barbie Girl doesn't blend at all with Nicki's version.
I never suspect you to be in call of  duty I just saw your bundle
I am going crazy
Yes  barbie
BARBIE
🎉
This ISN’T HIP HOP
A very chic clip!!!❤❤❤
Ice's voice makes you wanna fugg her right now
Barbie is white though
❤❤It’s Barbie ❤
Nicki makes my top 5 all time favorite Rappers
Camera man clearly has a crush on Nikki lol........ Ice Spice is barely in this xD
Who’s your enemy

This people want to banned this because is no for kid this toy people say that is no good is only like a 18+ or something bad so people need to banned this so that all
Truely cursed; ain’t no way the five yesr olds want to hear this, maybe the teen/adults looking for memorys but that is it
Trash
SLAAAAAYYYY QUEENS ❤💖💗✨🎉
La wea ordinaria 😅😅😂😂😂
At the end Slaaaayyyyyy😂

I don't understand why would a Barbie song visuals is soo sexualising thing ever today's hip hop world is of sexualising everything
2 months after and I’m still thinking we need a 6  minute version of this. 2 mns is just short 😢
your good nicki❤🎉
Slaaaaaaayayyyyyyy
Pure softporn dedicated for 12year olds. And all these 30year olds defending it here. Im crying.
I like how they do the back and forth rapping, that is an old school duo thing and I wish more duos would do that
So....the neighbour just went back to bed? After hearing someone screaming and ringing their bell? You don't have to open....but call the police!!

Nicki Minaj my wife loves your music she's a big fan wife loves pink could you send a shout out to her name's terrelle McCoy she's 23 weeks pregnant she would love a shout-out by her favorite artist
The state of her 🤦🏻‍♂️
Everything is plastic😂😂
Tell Diana to pay me for spinning me for years or else I do not want to be with her she needs to pay up and find someone else . She has kept my kids for 5 years without any contact and thinks she’s a friend or any help while I work for her she’s mad and I’m gonna send ZoZo after her life (tell her) she needs to pay...
Ice spice is cute and nicki is hot I loved how they worked together

Wack youd think they'd make this song all original. They should have just used the original it is a way better version. Even ken rips his verse kiss me here toss me there hanky panky. That bar alone is better than this track. Just saying.
I wish this song was twice as long. I love it so much. It’s been a minute since I’ve been into a song like this.
Barbie was designed to represent perfect proportions on a female body. The cast on this clip is Chinese made dolls with the limb proportions all messed up. Clap clap to the new gen!
Great song! I love when they're n the jet skies
and how do you dance this?  Where’s Aqua version
Nicki is pure talent ❤. Ice spice is going on fire too ❤
Well... this was trash. Think I'll watch Aquas' original video.
0:31 I'm Barbie girl????? Woman.... you're pushing 50 😵‍💫
👛👚👙🐽🐷🐙🌺🌸🍬🩰
Jesus is coming
AWSOME
She is in a movie TEATHERRR
I love youre song
Prefer original song..
Only the least of us look up to Barbie.  Huge majority of people understand she's vapid and useless.  If you have an outfit for every career, you aren't successful in the traditional sense, you're probably a model and therefore........  Useless.
The movie is for kids. Right?
❤🫶
Who watching In nepal?
I listen to this every day❤slay
The song was great I loved it. It’s the movie I didn’t like :(
Should've had Sofia Vergara as Barbie. And this piece is 🔥🔥🔥
The worst nicki minaj song

Hi Barbie
I came here to just dislike the video
why is my barbie so thiccc
My favorite scene in this video is the  part that Nicky says “I’m ready to bend” and she twerks.
slay queen so slay😜🎀
This sont its its very very good
Nicki snd ice spice where SLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Nicki always eat💅🏾😭
متت 😂😂🤏💗🌹🔪
i have seen dance secret number on tiktok and i came here
IT GIRLS AND WE AINT PLAYING TAG ‼️
U getting shot
This made me feel like a 23-year-old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace. This song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universe luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like the contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, and the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again, my good friend. A world without you would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes, I 100% agree with no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super Saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let society's standards shape his/her/its life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable, and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. These thrilling instruments make it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.
Yes 😗
Nicki  you  are  a  20000000/10
Ayyeeee
The worst clip i have seen even, when i had watched my eyes got blind
The original song and video by Aqua had a tasteful level of sensuality. However, this new song and video come across as excessively raunchy and distasteful.
Meme en France on l'écoute tous 😂🇨🇵
You two look like RAKSASHI👹 not BARBIE

This is more of a “bratz” some than a Barbie song. The energy feels kinda off for the “prissy” nature of Barbie
ice looks like a real doll 🩷

The best part of the song 2:10
かわいい
Them selling unabashedly olip*p product placement just shows the joke of products as feminism
I ain’t gone lie they snapped 😂🔥🔥🔥
they do so much plastic surgery that they end up looking like real life plastic Barbie dolls
Que bosta...que horas ela vai começar a cantar?já se passaram dois minutos e nove segundos.
Her name is in the movie cuz Barbie's friend is named Nikki
The collab we never knew we needed 😭😩😩
Eso es basura para mis oídos
🤮🤢 one of the worst pieces of music I’ve ever heard and worst pieces of film I’ve ever witnessed.
Barbie rich
Nicki from  kish in KENYA
Nicki  good  song
Ice Spice, sucks. At least her flow does. So WHY is she getting all these collabs with people she hasn't earned the right to collab with. I mean WHO even IS SHE?
Orignal from 2000s best
i want you
I tought this song was only for white😂girl with blond hair.
Well.... not quite as wholesome or cute as the original, but I guess it works. Poor Barbie for turnt 😅
I just wanted to say "gotta keep an eye out for selenurr
So vulgaire... 🤮
☺☺☺☺
Still on repeat. I love this
she devoured🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Look at all the fake top comment xD

Im glad my children will not be allowed to watch this degeneracy

So feminism itself sexualized women and blame patriarchy for it😂
They were able of this massive achievement : make me disgusted by female bodies!
The best❤❤❤❤

Me checking the guys who listen to the song on the comments 🧐😳🔥💯
I was here like a month ago and it barely had a 1mil followers now it has 70m(and counting). Brought my daughter to see this and I got a nostalgic feeling when this song played after the movie ended.
Not to forget i own Nevada,  Pierce  Vegas now
The collab we didn't know we needed
Yes im the culinary chef from Germany 15 years experience,  i dont belong to nobody,  and not cooking for nobody! Im since 8 months fighting against the frod cousin and the annoing Johnsons around here ,lol
What a hidden talent! It's better to still hide it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imma just say it.... Nicki bodied Ice Spice lol that's why she the queen... just saying
Man that has to be one of the worst things I have heard. These women don’t even look real. It’s all just commercial. Not a single hint of creativity…
Not this being my top listened song on spotify rn 😂❤
All I want is to make their singing and basses quieter and the Aqua song louder in the background
Bro i understand nothing what they are saying
Just ewww

I have the impression that the more time passes, the more the music clips become intros of wacky p0r**gra_phi-c movies 😮  R.I.P the 90's 😔
Sim, essa música é um surto coletivo
Why is the nasty 304 a role model?  I feel like  I can smell her through the screen.

You ruined the iconic song😭😭😭😭
0:06 Sounds like they messed up the crossfade function on the 808, or they didn't EQ the keys properly and their low end is bleeding. Weird tiny mixing thing, not a big thing but you can hear slight distortion there  this song aint bad but it's tiring seeing every musician on the planet trying to cash in on the drill trend
Fire girl❤❤
Our daughters will grow up in a barbie b*tch world now.. it's a shame how almost all female role models use provocative methods to gain fame and money.. and no its not just a song.

As Algerian my country ban barbie and this song is L as an Muslim 💀
#topicsvevo
Love Nicki so no offense, but super disturbed by the fact that Mattel took legal action against Aqua's Barbie song but it's endorsed in the background  of an accepted song linked with Mattel. Double standards much?
🩷🩷
Es orible no es como la cansion de barbie y no tiene nada de barbie
It's insane that a kids son have cusses
Soy la Uníca qué hablo español😭

God, I can’t hear the actual song in the background over Nicki Minaj’s singing.

The producer on the beat is 🔥🔥🔥
STILL #25 IN GLOBAL TRENDING WOW
Best song in world
Sooooo gooood
Hi
This is a great clip for a promo but a terribly bad song. I know Nikki can do far better, not up to par.
Hm. What a weak song and production compared to the cheap (or not so cheap!) Danish original. I don't get it. I mean, after Mattel was initiating law suits against Aqua and their label, and lost everything with proof of the Supreme Court... and then Mattel later actually NEEDED Aqua to help selling their toys that nobody wanted anymore.. we must call this a very heartless remake. Leave me alone. That's not 90ies, but neither 2020ies.
Love you ice pcise
Cardi B could never
I swear qhwn i get deployed imma play this so the last thing a russian or chinese hears is ice spice and Nicki shitting on them

The end of the video reminded me that my mom told me that she was a girl, she was a big fan of Barbie and once she invited her friends to play, she never invited them again because they left them like at the end. so true 😩
NAH BRO THIS SONG IS MORE FIRE THAN THE CORE OF THE EARTH
The end 😂😂😂
Nicki could have done the whole video no ice spice need.
As a Tyrone version of Ken, I can approve of this song. 👌🏿💯
Okay but they had OLIPOPs in this video hahahaha! I love that drink.
W video on mute
La canción de aqua esta mejor
Este es el claro ejemplo de Buena pelicula Mal soundtrack  Estuviera mejor la de barbie girl
"its barbie b**** if you are still in doubt "
No.
If you're streaming this song  thank you😊❤😊
Orignal is still better
Why were the Barbie’s white?
I love 🥰🥰 nicki and ice spice
1:08 the best part
❤❤
A good song damaged by two girls who write them the song yeeeeeey 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
It’s so funny to me the reason the original Aqua version was super controversial because Mattel didn’t approve of it, there was a lawsuit, etc (mostly for inappropriate lyrics they didn’t want associated with the kid’s toy)……and then there is this, the OFFICIAL song 😂😂😂 fuggin slay girls ⭐️
Ice spice brings nothing to the table. She mumbles and is cringy when she dances. Nicki didn’t need her. And neither did Taylor Swift.
Stop ülayin with em riot
Good song

"Barbie is for kids" 💀
Just found out ice spice is autistic. Kinda makes sense.
DISGUSTING PLASTIC
CAN WE JUST AGREE NICKI NEVER DISAPPOINTS AND CAN NEVER MAKE A BAD SONG!! ICE SLAYED AS WELL...

Lame song, original anyday better
Setting Playback speed .75x to learn the lyrics 😅😂😂 it sounds good like that tooo
Slayyyyyyyýyy🎉🎉🎉🎉
The song is dope but this the same way I felt about the lil nas x video..... I can't watch it
Love it
All the boys watching this for a reason 💀💀😈
Nothing special though and is that the entire video? It's so short lol.
Every ice spice song sounds the exact same Change my mind
Looks like they decided to combine the famous Aqua song that I was no stranger to exposure to when I was exposed to along with religiously following the toy line that this theatrically-released film involving meta humor featuring a role from Will Ferrell while simultaneously seeming reminiscent to a breakaway hit from another theatrically released film falling under those same circumstances (turns out I wasn't kidding when it came to realizing that as the first trailer hit the scene on Christmas Day of 2022 which, spoiler alert...turned out to be the opening scene): https://youtu.be/ia8aKO4_pfE
1 or 2 topics at a time.  5 to 8 hours per topic.  EVERYONE ON EARTH IS SIMILAR BECAUSE OF THIS

Strange that Mattel tried suing Aqua back in the day, for sexualizing Barbie...and now they're down with Nicki 😂
Yesssssssssss so good to 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🦄🦄🦄🤟🤟😘🤟😘😘💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️🦀🦀🦀🦄🦄🦄👍
Nicki is a confirmed Barbie now! Her rap never disapoints

I know what write... SHITYYYYYY
💞💕💓💗💖💝💘
barbie represent fake entitled thots, so I refuse to like anything related to barbie. Used to like Aqua but she gets banned to now after that delusional movie
Worst song of all time. Nicki and spice fans can cry down here 😂😂😂
RUBBISH!!!!
"It's BARBIE B***H... you can JOIN THE WAVE...I've done PENNY, NICKCLED, DIMED...I done COINED THE PHRASE" 😮
Omg you and Ice Spice SLAY at this Song Girl 💅❤
I'm watching  this more than one time❤
Mulheres se achando só que não estão com nada
The old one is better
It’s trash
Yassssssss😂

Da Fuq did I just watch????
The only Nicki song I'll ever bop my head to
Or a AI generated character no offense
Why does ice spice look like an npc
Nicki has actually gotten older.. old age is refusing to hide😂
I need to say Nicki and ice popped off!?
you're a barbie  bish in a barbie sh*t like it's realistic it's not fantastic
I'm always here
Nicki Queen
👉👂💥
Yeah but aqua sued them for not asking  for using theyre song in this music video
El videoclip no me gustó tanto que digamos está un poco subido de tono  Le doy 6.5
Yk, this is actually pretty good ngl. Use aqua for the base and Nicki for a rap is perfect. Fans do this for content. But this perfect.
My favorite part is when nicki Minaj says “rad, but he spank me when I get bad, I’m in la rodeo drive, I’m in newyork madison Ave, I’m a Barbie girl pink Barbie Dream house” 😂😂😂 it’s giving likeeeee ✨baddie vibes✨ 😂😂❤❤!
Was this ad useful?

I did a dance video to this song
This video scares white guys who have small packages

Mi pregunta, ¿Por qué la Barbie de nicki es tan blanca? Que tiene de malo que sea más oscura😅
Weird Barbie at the end 😂
Trash

And the funny thing is the original Aqua has 1.2 billion views and 8 million likes just saying
Spoilers! It was so unexpected when the song played at the end of the movie well at least for me
I love it was a amazing song
This would go so much harder without the Aqua sample ngl

Nicki: I'm a 10, so I'm pulling a Ken. Her husband's name is Kenneth (Ken)
La mejor cancion de barbie la peor fue la de lua 😢

This sounds like it's just Nicki Minaj talking over the Original Barbie Girl by Aqua song.

I checked this song out to keep an open mind, but 18 seconds in and I had to pause it to write this comment that it sucks. Don't copy an artist if you plan on ruining her masterpiece.
Love this

They should make an album
THIS IS ICONIC

I prefer the original barbie girl by aqua
70M views incoming! Keep watching
i love this song
The “slayyyyyyy” at the end was actually slay
Only  Nicki Minaj could make a tune like this work with very little help from writers you go girl. Seriously i wouldn't have listened to this tune if it were any other artist trying to pull it off. This song sucks with out you girl.
THE ENDING BROOOO
The truth is that the original barbie girl is better. Comentario de una persona latina para aclarar

The fact that this song is still topping the music & video charts. 💯
The thumbnail 😂
+ High class sophistication is a form of femininity at its finest because it consist of what? Those who know the answer are most likely capable of constantly and consistently living up to the pleasure, potential and responsibility of femininity and masculinity which is one of the primary key's  in becoming physically fit, mentally sound and spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom. For only at this level of body awareness does one actually have the self-control, discipline, loyalty, devotion, appreciation, respect, confidence and playful determination to consciously acknowledge and physically participate in being true towards love, honor and the creation of life in the way of marriage between a husband and wife mother and father.   Option 2 not quite as exciting physically, mentally, financially or spiritually beneficial rewarding nonetheless a quantum leap in progress from the way the mass majority from coast-to-coast globally more so here in America for the last hundred and 50 years or so have been missing out on. Even more specifically currently today Donald Trump and like-minded who are lacking the physical and mental capabilities of being able to ground and pound slip and grip into paradise so intensely intimately that it gets the soul and spirit off with no negativity attached maybe even in the free and clear.  sincerely these points have been scientifically classified and religiously verified as the absolute truth. In layman's terms no one can express or receive love or any other desired emotion in its entirety if you  them they don't know themselves from the inside out.  In other words learn your body's capabilities and limitations by fully engaging with all your body senses to their extreme limits in the most efficient way that is humanly possible..  S.R.F.

I honestly feel like they could have gone to any ghetto, picked someone off the street corner, offered them 10 bucks and the would still have done a better job than "insert silly name here with annie wig".   Talentless

Some many bots on these comments! Yall all saying the SAME thing! "Hits different when leaving the theater", "15+ years, iconic", ect. The modern music scene is FAKE and TRASH! Basically paying for bots to like and comment. Anyone can be famous if you "play the game".

Man, Aqua (the original singer of the song) must be pulling in some huge royalties after this movie and its spillovers
Worst thing I've ever seen in my life..
If the kids that was playing with the dolls than saw this would have been thinking to this day of what they just bought them
Do pinkie pie

Became nikki's biggest fan after this
Where is oppenheimer when we need him the most
https://youtube.com/shorts/pMEHFElDWCw?feature=share
Queen of rap
I feel like the whole thing about Barbie is like women empowerment but this seems so weird. I feel like the over sexualization is doing the opposite. It makes them seem like objects for 14 year olds to have a good time to. Idk this video is just really weird to me
Anddo we have a problem
I love this song and superbass and moment for life I love you you buetiful niki I adore you I just turned nine
This is the only video where i can feel feminine energy in ice spice. It is strong
I’m a boy and I still go hard
Barbies are pretty
are you barbie?
Ice & nicki bestt girllls
Cringe
I've never heard such monotone rapping in my life.
........
That's a Barbie for adults ,no way i'm gonna introduce that Barbie to kids 😅
😂❤
Is ice spice supposed to look like Wanda from fairy odd parents?
Officially the worst song I've ever heard in the world
I hate Barbie
🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑
ate down
Women ☕
You ruin the Barbie song how could you 💀💀💔💔💔💔
Very good song I LOVED it! the only bad thing is that if they sexualized the song a lot ..... I hope and understand
sLaY💅
Nicki rainha do rap. I love  this song!!!!!!.. Salvando o rap feminino em 2023 nicki minaj  e ice spice.

She sounds like pop smoke
Ellas llegaron a callar bocas y demostrar que son las mejores ❤❤
The duo we always needed:
Amando cada día más a la reina ❤❤
I love this song and song is my favorite song by Queen nicki and ice spice
0:38 the bass during this part was insane in theaters
1:16 best part
lindas las dos reinas
reina indiscutible
la mejor cancion de una barbie para barbie
reina y princesa juntas devoran .....
ella siempre la reina del rap 😍
Queen barbie 😍🥰
Why they didnt invite the original singer from the song?
WE MAKIN IT OUT THE BARBIE DOLL HOUSE WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🔥
slay
Te amo
Song isn't bad but that video was bad and not in a good way
It’s weird that she’s in her 40s and married. This is wrong.
this feels like its a huge advertisement
Grammy please. They deserve it. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If I hear this again, Barbie ain’t gon wanna party no more. 💀
THIS IS SLAYING GIRLL
smahs
She The next barbie
I love you Nicky minaj and ice spice your my favorite singers in the entire world

Ice spice on that jet ski look like she wearing a life vest.
I'm bad like the barbie ❤❤🎉🎉
Kind of ironic that nikki made this considering over 50% of her is plastic
I'm a kid but I still listen to u
Nicki
my gf loves this song 😂
AQUA's song wins
This is one on the worst things I've ever seen or heard, they should have gone with the original. Mattel was mad at the original about how it made barbie look but they're not mad at this!?!?!
I literally love the outfit ice spice was wearing when she was in the car ❤❤❤ and y'all are also sooo pretty 😍😍
Olipop 😆😆😆
I can rap and sound like her let's go
I'm a doll but still wanna party 🎉
Trash bag remake. 😂
SLAY BESTIEEEEEE
I always hear New York medicine ave 😂😂
That's my kind of Barbie
Ice spice built weird 😂
This video there is high deep editing but it's good 😘😘😘😘😘💋💋💋
this actually eats
actually it’s “all of the barbies ARE bad” not “all of the barbies IS bad” because “barbies” is plural which means you use are, and not is.
Funny Part:I DRINK OLIPOP🤭💅🌸
IM BAD LIKE THE BARBIE 🎀
I’m so shocked I like this song
Imagine if this s*it was the first thing that aliens saw...
These dudes really think they females

Ice Spice cannot rap and she doesn't have a voice. like we just put everyone on album nowadays!
This song is INFERNAL TRASH, but sadly it sticks in our heads.
SLAYYYYYY GIRLSSSSSSS SOOOOO SLAYYYYy GIRLSSSS
The best thing about this song is the background music.
How do yall genuinely sit by and call this music. 💀 it's literally so sad to watch tbh
After stumbling across this, I don't even know what to say.
She ate this up bro I keep on listening too jt
Nicki is dope, ice spice trash

Im in love with both of u
Hi
This song sucks we all like the old one
This song…I don’t know why I hated so much, I mean it is good but I was expecting that the original song of Barbie world was going to be showed in the Barbie movie :(
This song…I don’t know why I hated so much, I mean it is good but I was expecting that the original song of Barbie world was going to be showed in the Barbie movie

Why did they choose white barbies?
to be honest i have never heard ice spices voice, but i quite like her tone
Really I like ice spice’s pink hair it’s better than orange hair 🫶🏻 I like this song so much!! But the best one on this song is… NICKI MINAJ and this song the best in Barbie album ❤🫶🏻
Barbie:Life in plastic,it’s fantastic! The sea:am I a joke?
my ears want to bleed
this is bad
Saweetie and Nicki would’ve been better 😍
The orginial is 100% better 😅
Nicki has the most recent
Way to ruin a classic
its weird hearing nicki rap like icespice, but she still rocked it
🎉
I'm so glad this degeneracy hasn't had billions of views
We live in a strange world
how this barbie but both these women look like they could pull trucks for a living 💀 n y’all eating it up crazy how when it’s the other way around there’s no “culture vulture” 😂
absolute trash
Sexyyyyyyyyyyyy❤

Awful. Leave Aqua out of this
GO BARBIE GO BARBIE

Barbie movie is trash but this song hits
I know Aqua was rubbing palms like BIRDMAN when the movie came out.
Horrible
Ice looked like Latto for a min.
I ain't even gonna lie, this is straight fire 🔥🔥🔥
Looks like a bunch of demons infiltrating childrens heads....
Queen nicki 😍😍
Use me as the D I S L I K E  B U T T O N
“We ain’t selling out” oh fr???
The fact that the white shirt is see through 0:38
Trash trash trash 🗑
Nicki still goated n yea yall boff did that ❤‍🔥
que manera de destrozar una buena cancion.... esta version es penosa
Since when did music videos have so many ad placements. Ugh

I love your song I literally watch it every day my mum gets mad at me but I have no care I don't care🎉😂❤😅
definition of trailer park trash.
weird attempt at brainwashing little children with this one 💀could easily do without it
Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice= our barbies
Klipteki kadınlar beş para etmez abi Barbie sarışın mavi gözlü ve muhteşem fizikli bunlar yaratık gibi birşey şaka mı bu
Just some softcore on YouTube...
if Nicki released Pink Friday in 2023 with this song in the album 🤤💯🔥🔥🔥
🤮
Load of bollix like the movie 🎬
GO NIKKIII! I'm starting to like ice spice!
Do native English-speakers understand what they sing? When they say "Barbie", I always hear "Bobby".
Nahhhh my baby brother can sing better than you
I don't mind Nicki, but the other girl was such a bore. They really should have chosen someone else to do this song with her. The original song is fun and playful. Nicki's energy was fine, but she should have collaborated with someone with an energy closer to hers or higher. All in all, I didn't care for this version. The feature can make all the difference. Maybe there will be a remix with a different person.
Yuk!
The fact people still this to this garbage and look to them as role models. Gives me hope in life
The puppet has met her clone.
RAD❤️😙😚😋🫶🏻🫶🏾👯0:25
I'M STREAMING THIS Y'ALL
Ice spice voice sounds flat i'm not into it
This made me suicidal

Ain’t barbie like skinny and tall and these hoes are chubby and short
Eww I hate this place sometimes
Girl Barbie I spice why did you Barbie life size😂😂❤❤😂😂❤😂❤😂❤😂😂❤❤😂❤😂😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂😂
Sickening. Music like this is part of the reason for America’s godless moral decline. Not wholesome at all.
Sexualizing something made for children the epitome of what's wrong with this country, non boundaries or respect
THIS SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I don't want to be a hater but this song has no soul no emotion nothing straight junk XD
Original is better
Glad it’s not Cardi B
❤❤❤❤😙😙😚🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️👱‍♀️
This has more views than the actual movie 😂❤🎉 🎥 Nicki the gwoat frfr
The original is better
one of the worst things i have heard ever
100 m views soon with princess Diana Remix
Barbie girls are lit 🔥  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
you would think that with all this money they've got they could put out a better video than props on a green screen like some high school garage garbage
A reminder from He Man. We have the power. Jokes aside, this isn't a good one. Bad song, bad movie, bad genre. Faaaake.
Yes this is definitely appropriate for a movie based on a toy line for little girls 😬
I know Barbie rolling over in her box😂
I can finally rap this
🏳️‍🌈😭😭😭😭
Youre in the theater, collecting your tears as this starts playing💅
This should be unreleased
I knew you can do this ❤

Easy lick.
😵‍💫
Wow princess Barbie 😍❣️
Love this song and I love yous ❤
Todos sabemos que la versión de Aqua es mejor
SLAYYY
I have a theory: there are more guys who listened to this music [besides having seen the movie] than girls. 🦄
Production low, lyrics poor, the game is high, nikki plays on the floor, better play nice spice, or get left on ice, This a barbie world, no guy, wanna buy.
AND IM BAD LIKE THE BARIBIE
Lame.
the lack of talent in this duo is astounding
Aqua! I love that group.
absolute garbage what has the world come to
Dedicated to jayapal karaketta 😎
Now 116
No way people find Ice spice attractive or talented
More of that bass 😍😘
Listen, man. I thought Ice Spice had downs syndrome. I was all like, "Go her! Being a rap star" but then I found out she wasn't and I'm like... oh okay.
Am I the only 13 yr old here 💀
I love You Nicki Minaj 😍
Nicki rainha do rap. I love  this song!!!!!!.
THIS IS ABSOLUTE GOLD
The death of hiphop
this genuinely sucks
Let's gooo 63M!!!
Not the awkward olipop placement 😂😭
Why photoshop the mustang man
I love how the ending is how kids really play with Barbie dolls that was my reality
I think they used to call women like that looked and spoke like this some sort of tool... ratchet.
I love  this song!!!!!!. Voice : 100% Beauty : 100%Dance : 100%Barbie : 100%Perfect songRead more.
My only take away is that I want a pink jetski
Ngl, not nicki's best work.. just sounded like ice spice, and ice spice is.....for lack of a way of not saying mid... just not that good.
OMG Thi 's
wth
pretty sure barbie didnt drug and rob people..
WE MAKING OUT OF THE DREAMHOUSE WITH THIS ONE  . Desde Argentina esforzándome para colaborar con estas grandes artistas .
Omg, I can't believe that she is the same person as she sang like “I will serve all the house works and listen to you, master” with David Guetta! She looks way better!
pass
This is music? This makes WAP sound like Mozart
Disgusting
Yo what's with the thumbnail
The beats so fire❤
I love how girly yet badass this sounds. This song is for a barbie hitman that uses pastel pink weapons against her enemies.💖
I know nth about rapping…. But ice spice sounds like she’s just reading lyrics fast🥲
Resist. Resist. Resist. Resist.
The irony of having somebody who's body is majorly plastic/fake moving robotically, singing about a fictional world involving plastic figures.
Aqua's barbie girl song in background ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
barbenheimer moment
Can I sing a song on this beat
why she gotta go ruin the sonng
I love that ad for "Olipop" (Leads me to personally believe that this songs entire existence is an ad
Our society is fuqing doomed!
And they became wierd barbies in the end movie was fire tbh amazing vid
I don't think being plastic is a good thing.
oh hell nah
Me and the boys waiting for a Post-Credits scene:

Ice Spice looks amazing with pink hair!💖
Always casting them doesn't make it a good song!
Ice spice really needed this . Awesome marketing girls !
They fumbled this remix fr

THE ICONIC BARBIES
O Marley - Chasin ft. SO Out Now On #Youtube  https://youtu.be/gzW6l-xJn4U
this is perfect, "slaaaayyyy"
this addicting asf😭🔥🔥
Havent seen this much plastic in one video. 💀
This isn’t even music. This is so terrible it doesn’t qualify.
The original is like way better and this is utter trash
I love barbie and I watched the movie with my family
💅💅🏿
Slay 💋‼️
When did we normalize putting ads in music videos 🙂
Unironically Nicki is made of plastic too...
Jesus is Lord and He loves you
I like ice spice bc of her bangs 😅😅😅
Why won't god strike us down and start over
Art has completely left music, good god what have we done
This.....was terrible. 🤮
Sorry but this is just awful.
Atleast the world can say they smashed it.....
this entire video and the song were made by an AI
Having her on the Barbie movie soundtrack was one of the best decisions ever she’s always been about Barbie
Desde Argentina esforzándome para colaborar con estas grandes artistas 🙏🏽💖
😨🤯
This is not HipHop to me
Thumbs down.
Amazing! I didn't think it was possible to make a mediocre, annoying, but catchy song. Some how even more annoying, lower than mediocre, and somehow even more annoying.
Ice’s beat drop made my soul lift from my body.
why are all these comments lying? This song is so bad and horrible
Garbage
ice spoice mooommy
Still iconic
Who else loves ice spice and nicki minaj?
Esto es tusa 2
NUH UH
Why ice sound like a guy?
Cultural appropriation with that mullet
Is this song pose to be for kids? Smh
She came in flying on a jetski omg 😂 0:36 like tim and eric
Is it me or did Nicki change her voice a bit to match ice spice? I felt like she was holding back almost. Maybe not..
Dude this is like the adult version of barbie 😂 kids might accidentally click on this
this is aids
“Slayyyyyy”
More ice less nicki
Yessss still love the original tho
Ice spice is so average. Not even close to Nicki lvl.
mid spice
Trash
to much
I’m a Bronx girl livin in a world I got a Glock shottin all the ah opps
Hii
Which one is which? I don't know pop music.
Hate it! My favourite childhood Barbie Girl song ruined! 😫😞 why?! 😑😒  Sorry but it’s just my opinion no hate plz
I'm only listening the music, trust me I ong
Any woman who looks up to these disgusting 304's is going to end up alone and in depression regretting their whole life.
Imagine wearing this in public lol
i thought aqua have in this vid
This is so slyyyyyy
🚮
This is a slay 😜💅
Ice spice is giving Annie. Nicki really lost her pop music bars. This song is just a let down
🤩👭
Barbie is for little girls. I don’t see anything a little girl should look up to here.
Trash mix
all of a sudden everyone wants to be a barbie
isit me or does the beat feel like a demo ??? like they coulda done more there is all im saying,, like yeah the verses slay a little bit esp ice spice but like,,, beat is phoned in i was expecting more
Hi😉

Let’s aim for 100 million views
I love the hair that they both have Nicki has been my fav she slayed this song so did ice spice ❤😍
Disgusting.
Culture appropriate much? 👮👮🚓🚓🚔🚔
Lol
illuminati puppets are so cringe
I don't get it, Ice Spice sucks
Yo hi
Ghetto trash remix

So does this mean the Oreo Barbie is now cannon again?  If you didnt know, there was a Black Barbie Doll called Oreo Barbie 15 or so years ago, but was recalled because it was hidious, offended the black community and gave little girls nightmares. And yes, the avert even had a jingle "oh my whose this? its OREO BARBIE!....accessories sold seperately."
Nicki is the perfect barbie because shes really made of plastic lol 🤣
YASSSSS THIS COLAB ATE UP 💅💅👄👄😝😝 THIS VID IS JUST.. SLAYYYY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅🚨👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫

This makes me think all those islamic extremist groups were onto something
SLAY QUEEN
GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
I thought Barbie had an actual profession like doctor or lawyer
Who tf is ice spice? and why does she have all the facial characteristics of downs syndrome?
Funny thing is that this sounds exactly the way I expected it to.  LoL
Straight 🗑and cringe af
You should've had King Combs on this instead of ice spice. What kind of name is ice spice anyway
Ice Spice is garbage in her "talent" and delivery
this sucks.
The west has fallen -_-
I not like niki Monaj because she’s a baddie and I. Hate baddie 1:46
We need Ice Spice, Cardi B, Doja Cat, Megan the Stallion, Nicki Minaj song
im still confused about what i just watched
FAKE
Wack
Lyrical genius, when she said: "We it girls and we ain't playing tag" Goosebumps, Socrates is in the building! 🥴🥴
Sadly commercial hiphop these days is trash the new generation constantly disrespect the pioneers who came before them and dont care about their craft at all. Just wanna make the money and be out
Now that I’ve lost most of my remaining brain cells, it would seem this video isn’t very diverse and inclusive. Js
Ice spice la meilleure 😊
literal aids
The other girl looks like albino
👌
😘😘😘👍👍👍
this is a national disaster
Barbie .. cus she half plastic. We get it. 🤡😂😂😂
ice spice is so overrated
Michou better
God is dead
The dumbest thing ive ever seen
This video gave me cancer
wow this is really bad
literally me
That was dumb
Really little girls will watch this. Shame on you
my day has been ruined.
Haram
using 2 terrible female role models in a barbie song is crazy, almost like they want to brainwash young girls into acting like them.
we are doomed
🌹🌹🌹🌹❤❤❤❤❤❤💍🧢👑👡👠
I feel like this is fine for theatrical purposes, but people don’t know how to separate reality from the tv portion if you know what I mean. It’s catchy but the songs already been done. 🤷‍♀️ I feel like I’m just watching reruns when I listen to music today. Not very original just over sexualized and prideful. Praying for these strong beautiful women to get right with Jesus. We don’t need another Barbie! We need another mother and wife figure that loves her family. Promotes that and puts them first not just herself!
NO SWEARING
I honestly clicked on this to gauge how bad we as a species have evolved from music with emotion from bands like Nirvana, Alice In Chains and the Beatles to this utter madness. It’s sad to see this music ruining the next generation.
Trash song
Oh my God, this is awful.
They have real hair lol not fake 🤣
i came here to say that i absolutely hate this song and it killed my barbie hype.
The greatest song to every exist!
Can't get enough of this, my bb girl Nicki ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
HEY
Barbieeee season every season 🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶
Hey Barbie b!TCH YPUR SONG SLAYYED
Wee
Dream is to just sleep with icespice🥺

This is soo beutiful❤‍🔥
❤
Ohwoh😂
Slay
Bro took Barbie 2 another level😂😂😂
This song satisfies every cell in my being 🎀
Feels like this is probably more sexually charged than the original, not sure Mattel really accomplished the goal of a less problematic song 😂
"That's not an exotic bird, that's a seagull covered in curry powder" 😂
0:32
😱😱
EU te amo e te curto muito Nick 😍😍. Vc é tão perfeita e maravilhosa linda 😍😍👏👏👏😍😍👏
This is why society is doomed
@nickiminaj Jesus wants you to know that he loves you and he died for your sins repent and give your life over to him.   John 3:16-21   For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
Release the MW2 bundle already. 😂
The best thing about this song is the AQUA background.
Is it Ken or Kann

Oh my God, this song is efin annoying
the worst music video in 2023
Are kids watching this? Yikes.
I guess it’s not possible for you both to make a song about Barbie, a child’s toy, for a soundtrack of a movie that kids will be watching, without gutter language, right???
2:10 mi parte favorita, casi lloro de la felicidad en esta parte. Es arte puro 😌
Possibly the shittest song I’ve ever heard in my life and now it’s being forced down my eardrums on EVERY possible social media platform 🤢🤮🤬🤬🤬

When did ICE transition from being a guy?
How can we call this music?
why is this actually kinda good
I'm old enough to of been younger when the original came out.. both artists have done Aqua and the barbie girl song justice.. ❤❤
IM BAD LIKE DA BARBIE 🎉
Does anyone else feel like the Aqua part is too much in the background? They couldve emphasised the "you can touch, you can play" and "i'm always yours" more into the forefront or something a couple of times. It's too good to have it faded down in the background like that.
Nickii
Ice spice too singing with Nicki 😮😮😮😮😮
Siento que
Nice music Nicki minaj and ice spice
That was 2 minutes of my life I’m never getting back 😂
Do y’all think Ice Spice would have been in this track if Taylor hadn’t put her on the Karma Remix? It seems like she blew up out of nowhere and I’m curious if it was going to happen either way or not.
the track that keeps giving!
🎀LOVE🎀
she sings through playback, I was at a concert where she threw a microphone at a fan and the music played dal and she sputtered is nothing total garbage ugh
‘OMG it’s perfect’  ‘slayyyyy💅’
🤐
Is this music now? I did not understand a bit from nonsense noise.

Hi barbies
The fact that her man’s name is Ken is INSANE🥶
SLAAAAAAAY
Nice
Fun fact: Mattel dislikes the rendition of the '99 Aqua song and have done everything possible to stop it from spreading, but is so closely related that they had to put the song they spent years trying to shut down, notice the only distinguishible lines are "I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world" Thats more than enough to get the recognition and still filter the deeper meaning of the original lyrics
60k more views come on we almost @ 60M
❤❤👄💄💍💅👅
Nicki when will we get ur bundle in mw2😤😤
Why do they both sound like they are in the midst of hormone therapy?!

Nicki
THE TOTALLY STOLE THIS FROM AQUA! The werent "inspired", they flat out stole it! They did such a sloppy producing job that you actually can hear Lene from Aqua sing in the background! I always thought Nicki Minaj was a stand up person withgood morals. As rolemodel for many millions of young girls she should have known better! My daughter was crushed when i forbade here from listening to Nicki and told her she was a thief with loose morals because of this blatant theft.
Love that Aqua is in the background🎉
Yass💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾

UwU aaaaaaaaaaaaaa............
Hi Nicki and ice spice your my Queen you too 0:48 to 0:52 made my mum shocked love you

Can you make a song like barbie forever
POV you are not built like a Barbie and you are definitely not ready to party

Ice Spice is super lucky. I remember she said that she's Nicki's big fan and now she works together with her idol and their works are always great. I wanna be jealous but she deserved it.
This is a cheap  Imitation of barbie girl worst song ever

The movie was off the charts watched it with my baby girl at the end this song came on and it was perfect timing ❤️
I admit it ice spide sings very well and is a good actress so it makes her more beautiful and humble with her songs I fell in love and hagarro rhythm especially the music boys a liar, deli, aqua girl, princess diana are the ones I like the most reason never change
You go girl 💕💕🛍️🎀
I hate how they ruined the og song with this bs
Why do I always think that Nikki from Barbie life in the dream house is secretly Nicki Minaj’s sister😭
I watched the Barbie movie yesterday and at the end this song played and it was such a vibe!! 😍😍🤭
When the deep house rhythm penetrates your body, you will feel the burning energy, ready to face any challenge.
BEST SONG I HEARD IN A WHILE

What garbage …original song is 100 times better
SLAY so hard 😍😍😍
horrible
Oh this was trash
So the franchise had a problem with the original PG playful song but not Nicki Minaj and ice spice. That's legit.
The music is at the end of the film
0:49 ❤❤❤
Cooooll songgg❤
why does ice spice always wanna bend?
Isn't it interesting that Caucasians don't feel the need to have Caucasian Aunt Jemima salt & pepper shakers, or Caucasian Aunt Jemima cookie jars created to "equal" things out. It's so amusing and so very telling. Or is that too much truth for some to handle?
Rip to the music industry. One of the worst tracks in human history
This is my favorite song now❤❤❤❤
Ruined the song
Someone finna get sturdy to this bro 💀
Gotta love how she still hasn’t shown love to her skin color.. the Barbie that represents her is white lol she will always wanna be a white doll.
This is the best thing that has ever happened to me musically
I love b❤
SLAY Y'ALL ATE IT💖💖💖💖💖

This is revolting. By featuring the music of  these two hypersexualized clowns, the Barbie Movie pretty much negated their original message.

Cannot even be compared with the Original Aqua Barbie song!! That was a masterpiece that cannot be copied again!!
enjoying the song too much, even always annoyed why the duration is so short, even though this includes the duration of other normal songs
one of the best female MCs of all time and one of the worst female MCs of all time on the same track
When the barbie movie finished this somg came up it was unexpected 😂
I love the style there wearing 🤟🤟🤟🤟like it is the best creation they made
Eu poderei dizer que essa música é da minha época!
Congrats for getting this into the real Barbie movie!
This is honestly trash

This music sucks is like if we pick the old one and quit its own style to convert it to a typical 2023 song similar with almost without nothing special
Me watching this at 3 am 👁👄👁

Nothing can beat the old version of Barbie 😂
Nicki haciendo perfecto cada cosa ❤
After watching the barbie movie that song came on and I couldn’t stop singing😝

Ice spice I want you my future this song is madness
Ruined the original. Aqua must be spinning in their grave
Best rap❤
Awesome ❤
Ice Spice is one of the weakest rappers I’ve ever heard
Queen for sure 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Love it❤❤❤❤
Aqua ❤
I know that's right Nikki

Ice Spice is taking over what  Doja Cat left off!
Nicki Minaj and I spice I made a dance for your song
cring
The little “SLAYY” at the end was the cherry on top
Beat part of the Barbie movie is when they drop this track at the end. Had the whole theatre going crazy!!
a antiga é melhor...
My question is how is this appropriate for young girls and children in general? The song a vibe but honestly dark sinister agenda you can’t deny when you’re aware. Honestly yuck. Barbie can be empowering but let’s not push it to the point that being a ho is and emasculating men when they need to be taught to be more like men at times like this.
Music has really gone down hill
😂😂😂😂
After watching the movie Barbie and then coming back.. Nicki killed this video.. it was already fire❤❤❤ but it’s like she shoot this video on the Barbie the movie set. Like even the part where she did the scene from the movie where Margot Robbie was huge oh my.. ❤❤❤ this is NEXT LEVEL

Breaking news 😂😂 this came on early this morning 🌄.. right before I got to work...
The original song was so much better and they actually sing in the original and not talk.
I love how Barbie has been Nicki Minaj’s aesthetic her whole career & she sampled this legendary hit perfectly. Minaj has always did her samples her best! Ice Spice was a great choice.
Barbie - sharing the generational knowledge of the no hands no look drive.
😢🎉
The best duo, the Queen & Princess 👑🦄🧊👑

OMG girl u are amazing cep going girl go

Am I the only one that made the Nicki Minaj Barbie in this doesn’t even look like her? Her Barbie is literally just a white girl. 😂 sick video tho
Hi barbi 💖🩷✨️
I find it rather debatable for some news outlets to say that Mattel's previous history with Aqua kept the original song from being used for the film as this one sampled it with the very same lyrics Mattel questioned back then.
THE REAL QUEEN BARBIE!!!!!

Leave it up to Minaj to ruin one of the greatest guilty pleasure songs of all time.

Nicki Minaj made her own wish come true. I'm surprised she hasn't found a Ken Doll type ninja already 😭
It's great how they press a smile on their faces knowing the world is judging them and editing their moves.

This is disrespectful towards Barbie! The video, the song is very catchy 🎶
God loves you all, turn to him now. He gave up his only son to die on the cross for our sins. Jesus is coming soon, he loves you all so much he took the awful punishment that we deserved. Repent your sins and spread the gospel, you are never too far gone to give your lives to Christ.❤

May Nicki Minaj you and I be ready for the return of Jesus Christ!!
Jesus Christ is coming back!! watch and pray not to stay because He is the way the truth is the life no one comes to God if it is not through Him
❤❤❤
That background barbie theme does not go with this at all... Terrible...
It should be on the dark web
Sin duda la mejor rola y más indicada para hacer este Sound, sin duda la mejor rapera nunca ❤️
I'ma boy but this song in the Cinema was fire 🔥 even now its 🔥🔥🔥

Ice spice will go as fast as she came. Too much exposure too soon. Come back to this comment in two years.
50M LETS GOOO!!!
This music was even at the end of the barbie movie 😮😮😮😮
I dont think I've ever hated a song more
I just can't stop listening to it
Fake reviews dawg 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀 never understood old culture
Love this song! Video is great too but I can't stop trying to figure out if that other girl has downs syndrome or not. Not trying to be mean, she probably doesn't have, but her eyes look so much like downs. On the off chance she does have it, you go girl!
https://youtu.be/eMymSXUN9nQ
Wow almost 50 million views, love it.
hey Nicki and ice can you tell the girls...  don't listen to them get more work done because there's nothing better than waking up and not needing stunner shades to complete a look  this music, dancing, acting and reacting takes a toll so you deserve to look killer in the street every day free of charge   most of this is just fillers to satisfy but I know there's that immortal honey treatment you and your career can have that lasts a lifetime and is natural ❤❤❤
Classic one is much much much better than this one

The Movie, The Soundtrack.. They were in sync; good job! Way to go...
Hi barbie 👋
I love Barbie Nicki Minaj you’re so pretty and Barbie ice spice
Mind blown 🤯
The beat🔥🔥
48.884
Omg like when she did that
the amount of hours this song has been playing in my head rent free tho---
2:01 split Barbie at the end lol😭
The necklace that ice spice is wearing I have the same one as her ❤❤
Nicki is fine, but Ice Spice is just the knockoff 🙄 Ice Spice is a big pick me. I swear. She acts like she's attractive.
Their style is so ghetto. So much money wasted to look so tacky
Is Mattel kidding? THIS is who they go to for a more family friendly version of this song? What world do we live in? Also Ice Spice is just pure trash. Absolutely AWFUL.
48.865
Pero que 💩😡🤬 acabo de escuchar?
I’m a keep listening to this over and over Vibin out until I die and I’m a black person I don’t know why I’m talking like a white person but this song is too good and I cannot wait to see the movie probably going to be in a while love you I spice and I’m not a fan of Nicki Minaj but I know you’re music is good
New generation always mess up classic songs SHM
GRAH!
Cmon barbz push push for 49m

Best part of this song is when she stops singing
Slay 💓
My favorita
Nicki do a News son Georgetown Karin g
In the end if the song the girls cut the doll's hair making them look like a feminist with a short hair. In other words, the feminism in this movie is everywhere, every detail you notice.
I'm in. 🎉crazy part is there's a barbie movie coming out.🖐️
This is my new favorite song, literally. And also, she deserves this. She’s been in her Barbie persona for over 15 years, and she finally gets to do a Barbie song for the actual movie. It’s crazy!😮
Soy Argentino y estoy esforzándome para colaborar con estas grandes artistas ❣❣
Only barbz can like this comment.
😘 slay
They really made that Aqua song listenable. I love their vocal colors.
Can we appreciate them putting multiple product placements within a song that in itself is a product placement?
DANG a dream come true
I like how Nicki said we got Bars but ain’t bailing out
This beat is just sick!!
Nicki n the Barbies lol hhh
SHAWTY GOT THEM KNOCKERS

Whoever did Ice Spice's makeup for the convertible look made her look like she has down syndrome with the way they did her eye makeup. They did her dirty.
I’m a goku world and we have nipples and we are buff we always be raging it’s fantastic we be fighting

Sorry but I don’t accept ice spice as the princess like she doesn’t even have an inch of the talent Nikki does…… and sorry to say but she bores me, if Nikki wasn’t on this track, I wouldn’t even listen to it more than once……. Spice voice put me to sleep, the spice ain’t nice

This corrupt music industry! This is not a song! It’s an embarrassment is what it is….You should of got P!nk to do the theme. It would of had rhythm, sass and energy…. Maybe a high note. This effortless attempt is boring. It has no hook and the only reason you’re listening to it is because of the film…. Million dreams is amazing.
Hi I love your music it’s so SLAY!!
Cringe
Crazy skin bleaching ....
Original song better than this awful fake
Mad track max rap , Nicki wearing the lil Wayne cap similar kinda rap . Love it though . Fire 🔥
Is this for kidss???

MY FAV SONG FOR NOW AND EVER SLAYYYYY😍😍💅💅
It just ruined my childhood memories of Barbie.......... everything is getting corny.
Barbie become a vvh0r3
How appropriate for two      females that are plastic to sing a song about a Barbie.  Then again they mumbled the words, so technically it’s not singing.
❤
50M let’s go Barbz
Non Nicki fans be like: who is Nicki?
Tell kennet petty no I don't want him as a husband and don't marry me again
Slayy
Now do oppenheimer
No no no no no no no
I watched barbie and i loved it especially the end where it plays this song❤❤
Wow, the original by Aqua is already hard to swallow, but with that rap put over it, it is absolutely unlistenable.
When they were playing was so cute and so slay
Barbie is only for girls ❤️👸
1B come soon this song ❤
All of the Barbie’s is BADD 💗💗
THIS IS THE SONG OF THE SUMMER ALSO YOUR SONGS ARE AMAZING ❤❤
🚮

Song way too short
The beginning of ever ice spices songs "StOp PlAyInG WiTh Em RiEt"   Me: who's riet
Kind of depressing that people can't come up with new music and just slap the original in the background of whatever they made and say it's a "Remix".  There are more musical instruments than the Bass.
Aguante Aqua, está versión es bozofia😅
Me encantó pero el final no me gusta cuando empezaron a rayar las❤❤❤p❤😊
Love u barbie
I’m OBSESSED with Ice Spice’s low voice!

I'm not trying to be "rude", but it's the whole truth... only "Aqua" and "Nicki Minaj" should've sung the song.
Nicki went all the way out for this movie. Barbie movie couldn't handle this song
I like nicki but this song sucks
That’s a great collab  Spice ice fits so well and nicki just stayed the poses;)
Thats my nicki and ice spice

We love u Nicki!
You girls are so pretty 😍
More grooming of the children
I don’t even watch Barbie but this is fire 🔥
I know now why this is a 12now
spice and nicki are a better duo than salt and pepper
She hit them Barbie goals!!! 🤷🏾‍♀️😜💗 Slay Queen Nickiiiii👑
I can't believe i was in 0:34
What a boring video
Hey, hey, there is already a song from the year 2019 that tells exactly the story of Barbie, the movie of the current year 2023, the song is titled "Lindo pero bruto" (handsome but fool) and it is sung by the queen of Latin pop THALÍA.
Love the video … Nicki is cute AF of course…. but ice spice looks weird  with straight hair it’s not giving for me
This video reminds me of the one she did with cassie “the boys”
I love this song so much,this song still stuck in my head
Cardi B is 10 years younger then you why she got you so bothered!!!!!!😂
Barbie movie is so good
Wow, 47 million views. Amazing
It sucks! The original song with Aquy is a million times better . This version has nothing to do with Barbie
Such a cool song
47M 🖤🦄 50M vamos
Should have been just Nicki would have been better
Bruh the daddy got me dying 💀💀
The end😭😭😭
How you turn Barbie drill?! Nicki is a monster in this game!
Can we appreciate Hannah Lux Davis for always giving us incredible visuals?
❤🔥🔥OMG
Y do I feel like I’ve heard this masterpiece in my past life 🙏before this world m in
Ice Spice is such an obvious industry plant
𝘉𝘢𝘳𝘣𝘪𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘺😂
Barbie still on top! If you haven’t been a true Nicki fan since she came up she’s been Barbie love the signature necklace she’s always worn ❤
This is so fresh and feels real Barbie vibes nick is just a Barbie doll😍😍😍😍😍👌👌👌👌😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨

Yes, get a girl
Can we do 50 mil?
SLAYYYY💅
I'm a Barbie girl and I wanna party 🥳 Love this ❤
I'm not religious, and neither am I a mom, but I can't be the only one thinking it's weird to have a song like this in a family-friendly movie? The song itself is cool, but it's just a lot of bad language knowing so many kids are also watching this movie.
Mais de 45 dias e estão em alta acho q já é a terceira vez c barbie world
As barbies que eu queria ter 😮❤
All that plastic surgery and you still can’t look as good as a Barbie doll. Smh. @nickiminaj
Ngl no one literally no one can do better than Nicky Minaj RAP QUEEN 👁️👄👁️
Que le icieron a mi puchamon?
Wish Ice spice kept it more clean though
If Barbie was created by pixar:
Love this!!!
I saw the Barbie movie with my wife a couple of days ago, but I don't remember this song playing in it (spent too much time laughing at Ryan Gosling's "Push" playing haha). When does this play in the movie?
I love this I'm addicted
Dope song and vid. I just don't see the same chemistry that hear...🤷🏾‍♂️ijs

yea yea yea Barbie
ice spice lip sync is cringe
Nice❤️
Yeah, Nicky truelly is the Barbie of our time 🌸
Sounds like something a 13 year old "dj" could mix in an hour or 2. You can take Britney Spears one more time instrumental, then add 2pac hit em up accapella. Then you get music that hits much harder than this 😊 This just sound like someone is playing 2 tracks over each other 😂
Tooop
He wanna playhouse
Did jog to this jam
This is just weird
李碩承崛起大富大貴❤🎉💎
THE QUEEN FINALLY BECAME BARBIE ❤
é tão sem sal essa ice spice kk

Get Bob Dylans name out of your mouth. Nikki minaj isnt fit to be the same planet at him let alone put him in a song.

Back here to say I love you, Nicki🥰❤️
SLAY
I love how they ruined the whole reputation of “kid friendly toys for kids”
man i really missed the dislike button
Full song?
This is so overrated
ABSOLUTLY AMAZING MY NEW FAV NICKI MINAJ SONG
rubish
Marvelous clip I loved it❤
I love your song it is amazing you should colab  more
So much better than the garbage aqua one
i genuinely love the lyric “all of the barbies is pretty, all of the barbies is bad”. it really emphasizes how beauty doesn’t come in one shape, size, color, etc. and that means a lot to me ❤
barbie for children now barbie for adult men 😅
this is so sad that this song is only at the credits 😭😭
" Barbie baddies be like "
you see the queen  is doing what her brand is all about and this is the same woman the industry tried to get rid of  in 2018 you all see she is the music industry😉😄😆💮
The vibe
You're barbie girl💖💖💖💖

Ice Spice rap is Best song. 1:04
Only time it works are the jersey areas. Hip hop and euro dance don't go together and they lowered the original too much. The jersey parts are more the originals BPM. It would have sounded better as an instrumental.
She is soooooooooooooooo cuteeeeeee and she is little mama and you are big  mama and she is just like you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love y'all❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song for We Barbie girls!!.. great job!
I love Nicki Minaj but the execution of this edit was actually terrible. How much more fake could it get?
"Oh my gosh, this is perfect" "sLaYyY"
Who told Nicki that she is 10 lol?

Number 6 trending is crazy 🤪
Ngl this hits hard😂
Most cringest thing of 2023 🤮🤮
They turn barbie from superficial to disgusting
Wonder how much olipop paid to be in this.
Me enamore de 1 <3
Escort barbies
The fact that Nicki is still a trending topic and 15 years into her career and remain her Barbie persona relevant is iconic. 🎀 This is very deserving that she is on the soundtrack although I wish she had a cameo in the movie!
Why did Activision bring such rubbish to Warzone 2?
why ariana grande wont make new songs videos? im so sad she didint post any music videos anymore
I think this beautiful song you people need chill  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ice Spice is hot!
❤
fabulous/awesome/wonderful NICKI 💓💓💓💓

Well.. there goes an iconic song
Ice with ginger wigs is really her brand just like nicki but with pink :)
Ice spice and Minaj are yum 😋
Always been a fan of a good story-telling rap song. It's evident these two have chemistry together and feed off of one another flawlessly, this really seems like a return to form for Ice Spice too. As a small artist myself with dreams of blowing up someday, seeing these two elevate one another's verses inspires me immensely. They should make a whole album together and be one of the first couples in rap to drop a whole project toqether! 🥵
Queen ❤❤❤❤❤
Goooo 100 million in 3 moth
She had a baby semi-recently? I'll be gahtdamn! 😊❤
50M lets go barbs!
Soy Argentina y estoy esforzándome para colaborar con estas grandes artistas 🇦🇷💝

Song doesn't really go with the message of the film
The sheer hatred I gave for this song is literally indescribable.

Still better than the original barbie girl I’m saying it sorry
Who wanted this?
0:11 ^ Stunning as always♥️🎶
Ew

Man I love this may have to make it my ringtone 😂😂
Trash

Ice spice isn’t Michael Jackson

Everyone else: raves about Nicki Minaj Me: sings along to the Aqua playing underneath... "I'm a Barbie Girl in a Barbie world, Life in Plastic it's fantastic!"
“I keep dragging her so she bald a bit.” 😭😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤
What they actually put this at the end of the movie and not the original version??
The worst
An other song of the queen ❤️
❤❤❤❤
WT# is that ?
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I am a 10 so i am pulling a ken 😩😩
La fregaron x completo la canción de barbie  🤮🤮. Prefiero la barbie Girl de aqua 👌👌👌🤙👍
What an iconic moment. The Barbie that knew as a child and the Barbie I knew as a teen came together during my adulthood to create another lifelong memory for me💕
Ohh so the aqua version was too explicit and not the barbie brand but this is okay. Make up your mind Mattel.
Hello

لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله

Nicki Minaj muito fodona mesmo, amo
Yikes! Oh no! She murdererd this song!!! The original song by Aqua is the best.
Hi

Blud thinks she's a Barbie 💀
Its too short ! We need a longer cut ❤
Barbie girl aqua 10000000000000000% mejor que esto no tiene ni ritmo pegajoso, esto lo escuchas una vez y ni engancha en fin que oena que no usen la versión de aqua en la pelicula es una pena
Congrats you destroy the original song
My favorite 0:49 and 1:29 🎀💕⭐️💖

The only thing I liked about the Barbie movie is the song that has been played in the end. No offense .
They’re always the perfect collab. They just need to form a permanent duo
GIRL YOU SLAYED 💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾
OMG
i was watching the barbie movie and I HEARD ICE SPICES AND NIKI MINAJS SONG AT THE END I FREAKED OUT
This music video has so many sponsors 💀
Nicki makes music for pretty people only so all the losers in the comment section fck off
Yeah this just sucks
I love your song, spice and Nicki are baddies
Ugh they butchered this song just to make it modern for the soundtrack
Hi ken
Is there room  for 3 baddies
Love the vintage style ❤️ 💙 💜 💖 💗 💘 ❤️ 💙 💜 💖 💗 💘 💛 🖤 💚 🧡
The collab we all needed.. 💓🎀
❤❤❤❤❤❤ congrats Nicki
Bu sarkı hem barbie hem harbi be dostum
I haven’t seen the movie, but I wish they would have given Nicki a part 😂
Should have just used the original Aqua version.
terrible, and abysmally shallow intellectual level, like all her songs, the west is so doomed
lolll the ending
Full Circle Moments
Only for the PR and Money. 🤭
How do people expect me to like this
They killed it and both fine af.
I cant tell whose singing their voice sound the excact same 😢
Is it just me or did I repeat the grah part ice spice says but Nicki is also awsome
SLAYYYY
1 man 1 jar >
this is such an iconic collab!!
ICE SPICE IS BEAUTIFUL GIRL IS ❤
😍😍wow!!!!!♡♡♡❤
I LOVE DIS SONG SM

Cc❤❤❤ eww
Hi barbie , hi Nicky .
One of the Barbies is bad! I wonder which one is bad🤣
This is so bad
Ice spice normal basic just like nicki….if they didn’t make the Barbie movie this wouldn’t happen.. so it’s trash.. song is ok.. but eh to me…
Bad like the barbie
🤪💅🏻🌸🌸🌸🌸🩷🩷🩷💖
Her flow is like water but sparkling water because her bars are harder to gulp ✨
Nobody is still before u tho
She got that crazy look n her eyes 😭😘😘😘😘
Oversexualizing everything 😢
amazing song!!!!!
Idk lol this is kind good the swer words though and the butts eww 🤢🤢
A❤❤❤

Cochinada de canción, más hablada que cantada aparte tomaron parte de la canción de Aqua, mejor hubieran dejado la original
Where's aqua?

I hope Barbie can be discontinued :)
This song is just 🔛🔝🫶🏻💕

Don't lie to me, you searched for this because the movie came out.
Ela se segurando pra não falar palavrão e tudo😘🙄💅
The real song of the summer ❤
Guys are lucky to have your song into the new Barbie movie me and my sister watched it two days ago it was so much fun I loved it and I love your song
they f the original song
It is indeed a Barbie girl 😳🥵
🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💕💕
Look she's famous
Horrible song
Really tried to give it a chance but it’s the worst Barbie girl remake ever and all spice is giving me is „laaaaame“. She has no outstanding voice, her moves are like being on a sleeping pill and her rap skills (for sure not even written by her) are just basic. Really don’t get the hype.
i’m french but this !!!!!!!
1:33 when she farts
This video is clean ASF😊
Who's here AFTER WATCHING live ACTION Barbie 😄
Nicki really helped this. Its official. I like an Ice Spice song ! 😁
Slay girlssssss🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂 slayyyyyyy
she's doing as if she was barbie she's to old for that🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Omg Niki love youuuu!?~🤩😊
fake🤣👎
Barbie has been ruined. Period.
yess
why is the cheeto pink
THIS IS THE NEW HIT FOR ME!
Garrah
But how is “I’m ready to bend” okay for girls? I’m confused how this is acceptable. How did the actual Barbie brand was okay with this?
Just saw the movie and I cried at the end but I loved it so much!!! As a Barbie/ rats fan made me so happy.😊

NICKI MINAJ IS THE QUEEN OF RAP (also ice spice)
Great now all the young ladies are gonna wanna imitate this OF generations here we come
SLAYYYY (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
The anticipation of seeing whether or not they'd use Barbie Girl for the credits, followed by the disappointment that they didn't, followed by the turnaround and vindication of hearing the sample come up, was one final emotional rollercoaster to end on.
this hits really hard
Tenemos que aceptar que ice spice de barbie se ve re bien😍

Who also always thought about nicki should be barbie?
I HATE BARBIE BECAUSE IS A CHAUVINIST DOLL!!!!.
Just watched the movie it was good
This is catchy af
The best part of this song is that that says: "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world, life in plastic, it's fantastic. You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere, imagination life is your creation" This rocks... It's a pity the volume was a bit low.
Successfully wasted 2mins

Mercifully short in duration

There is no other Barbie like Onika! Her unique style of pen is unmatched yet.
good version--- but prefer aqua´s
Nossa Barbie negra 🤧❤️
No one could ever be the real Barbie because she’s 100% natural and beautiful with no filter needed
To think that when Aqua released their song, Mattel went all over them, suing the band based on the prerogative that Barbie was being overly sexualized in their work... And now, this.   Don't get me wrong, I love Nicki, but putting this song inside the playlist of the movie just showed how much of two-faced they are.
This sucks
Good job Nicki 🎉

She really got this from unghetto lol he dropped this sample track 3 years ago.
Queen Nicki has done it again 🙌🏻👑💖💅🏻🔥🔥🔥
Una cagada ,es una verguenza nada que ver con la obra maestra de 1997 .
I came after a walk in nature, feeling naturally high. 15 seconds of this - all the usual mythological and psychological symbols, and I feel my eyes glazing over. This "art" is intended to make you forget about your natural connection with god and open your subconscious for suggestion. No thank you.

Such a trash song bro...
If these were the real Barbies, I would have asked my mom for G.I. Joe’s.  Yikes.
Yeah, I don't want the next gen to grow up thinking this is the norm right? It's just an art-form. Kind of like how a circus is
GYATT!!
😂 ho-es sublinal messeges🧠
I’m just imagine this being the barbie theme song 😂😂
Respect black people.  There's only one thing that's annoying and that's the mixed race.
Honestly..... Not that bad
I LOVVVVEEEEEEE ❤
It’s been a while since I’ve seen ads show up
As a minority this collaboration makes me enjoy Barbie as Ice spice & Minaj is great representation of myself and I can now jump on the Barbie bandwagon
I would’ve been SO disappointed if Nicki wasn’t involved in this movie somehow
Ice Spice is garbage
Its horrid! More like trash barbie!!
New boys a lier
Ice Spice without her Spice hair is offputting lol she’s still cute though
I love this song ❤
i adore this
Slay gurl you ate that niki and ice spice💅🏼💅🏼😜😝😘

It’s cool what nicki and Doja cat did because Mattel (the creators of Barbie) didn’t allow Aqua to make Barbie Girl and sued them for it because they didn’t want to be involved in the song at all but aqua is still in this song and I’m glad.
I mean they match they’re nothing but plastic

No joke this is the best collab ive ever seen
Blah blah
How do you spice ice spice?
This song sucks.  They should have used the original by Aqua only.
Oh my gosh this is perfect SLAY!
Nice song for Nikki not barbie. I wish it was a better mix. And I would have LOVED it if she somehow put "be who you want to be" in it like the commercials did.  Unless she would have gotten a copywrite from it then I understand.  And if it should have shown them in many different clothing styles and job occupations instead of just a pink back drop and the dream house. I get it would have been more expensive that way. But they would have gotten it back. Nikki is so skilled and ice is the new big thing so I get why they were chosen.  But it shows that they really only know barbie for being cute and pink. Not a princess' youtuber, race car driver, Big sister, doctor and all that. ....but thinking about it. She probably only played with the dolls. Whereas I only watched the films and games.  I do like the song. But it just feel like a Nikki song and not a barbie soundtrack with Nikki as the musician. Get what I mean? It's no different than her recent song... what is is called I'm drawing a blank...  Edit: red ruby duuuuuuuuuuuh🤦🏿‍♀️smdh
I love how they did a olipop ad in the middle of the video
Ummmm ok but the Kids girls everybody Is pretty :3
Am addicted💯🙌🏽
This is honestly pretty gross. I'm sure people will love it.
My favorite duo
i love the songggggggg

¡Wow!¡increible! ¡Muchas referencias a la pelicula!🌸🌸🤩
1:27       😂  😂  😂
This Song is at the End of the Barbie Movie 🫶😭😭
This is what happens when one of the worst rappers of the 2010s colabs with one of the worst rappers of the 2020s
ITS SO FUNNY HOW ALL THESE COMMENTS JUST IGNORE ICE SPICE (as they should honestly ice spice doesnt deserve her recognition)
Ice spice doesnt do anything for nicki minaj. I think she should had left her out of this and owned it.
I looooove it the Queen never disappoints Oooh and Ice Spice come oooooon❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thanks for ruining it
Love from India 😊

1:52 so thats where weird barbie came from
Si la de Aqua era bulgar esta canción y video demuestra ser peor de mentes plasticas y vacías  Esta canción pasará a ser olvidada rápido. La de Aqua Barbie perdudara en la historia será leyenda así no sea la oficial de Mattel será la leyenda mis hijas escuchan la canción de Aqua Barbie, vieron las canciones oficiales y les dio asco canciones que incitan y motivan a ser mujeres vacías de cabeza y mujeres de dinero
I'm a Barbie girl, pink Barbie!!! Dreamhouse!!!!! am a doll, but I still wanna party
Go y all two and cali
Nicki and ice spice have the same energy they could be besties
Barbie song trap remix 🔥🔥🔥
Why is no one talking about how good Ice Spice is 🤷‍♀️
I love Nikki and her music she is a queen
Cómo no los demanda la de la otra canción por usarla de fondo 😊😂

I feel like although there was drama surrounding Aqua's Barbie song, but that song basically helped make Barbie's legacy long lasting. I wasn't really into dolls but I loved that song. Just my two cents. ❤😊
MAKE ONE OF YOUR FAVOURITE MOVIE 🎥!!!!!!!!AND DO IT TOGETHER ❤
Fantastic
Nunca nunca le llegarán a Aqua con barbie girl esa si es una obra de arte
Ice spice got dem low key Downie vibes.
ICONIC 🩷🩷🩷
Nicki minaj elle met une tempête à Cardi B
Best barbie ost of the movie

A month now and this song is top 5 on Apple Music and now #1 on Spotify. Let’s go Nick and Ice !
She's been a fan of Barbie forever. Nice to see her living her dream. She's the ultimate barbie fan girl.

Garbage
Nicki Minaj getting all my last nerve she got a husband talking bout she wanna marry all the rappers 😂🧡
Childhood memories Ruined successfully 😢
WHY IS THE *GRRAH* SO ADDICTIVE 😭
I love how before the movie this was just a cute video but AFTER the movie you see it directly references the film!  SPOILERS(?)  - Giant Nicki like giant Barbie in the beginning -the jet skis transporting them - the men in the suits like the CEO board room men - the pink plane that greeted barbie - The girls make weird barbies at the end  Also so cute Nicki is sitting lie a doll in the beginning of the video
I’m the real life Barbie ❤️
Tell Barbie too go back in her box 🩷💕 because she’s plastic
I love when nicki make Barbie songs this is my 2 fav
This is utter garbage they done 30 seconds of lyrics and it's dead 💀 nah I will stick to the original
love this song, so catchy tune. I put it on repeat many times
💕💕💕
This is my first time seeing a song and Nicki Minaj is killing it and Ice spice yeah girl girl y’all are killing it I think for the rest of your life in the movie was great at how to and how do you song a song my mama how long yet and I’m up all night watching now
This is heinous.
The Original one is better but still slay

Just for nicki ..
💗
Bella canzone... Le due cantante sono super!!!! Un bacio grande a niki!!!
My mom : How many times do you listen this song? Me: ♾️♾️♾️♾️♾️♾️♾️
Trash
absolutely loved it😍😍😍😍
Ice spice’s face ALWAYS looks like she got 5 kids and she tired of every one of em😂 it jus b the looking like she waiting for that ebt  money to hit at 12am and like she secretly buys everything she has with child support money. Her body cute tho! BUT THAT FACEEEE!!??? It’s seen better DAYSzzz!! them wigs be so tight against her cranium .. she need some volume!! and curls and less edge control on these lace fronts .. she b lookin like a washed out highlighter in the face cause of that hair color… it’s just not workin for me. Many love this look tho. I just see a stressed out mom with kids that don’t listen …and an amazing body 😅
Fantastic role models for all the young girls

0:01 Ice spice finding the demon she try not to twerk
Better then the original
THE OG BARBIE😍💕
ice spice mommy
Is it too early to say summer anthem 🤷🏾‍♀️❤️
Wow
Well, this was incredibly disappointing. Predictable af and sounds like every single one of their songs. Could not tell this apart from their other trash tracks. The only “remix” is an echoed repeat of a sound bite from the song? They added NOTHING to it.
This was worth the wait!😂
Original 😶
Who is here after watching The Barbie Movie?🩷
How did they ruin it
I think nicki and ice spice won this
Compared to princess Diana this sht trash
Legit the queens 😍

11-17-23 😢🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
this vid & song is so iconic i just can’t get over the obvious ad placements 😭😭
The Aqua song but worse.
Nicki is the only obvious person to have a song on the barbie album 🩷
Braba demais ❤
Don't care for ice spice but I'm always here for Nicki 😩✊
Just amazing i love ❤❤
Very bad taste 😢
❤❤
😢 sad
This song has no flow. I don’t understand the likes ratio
Terrible
I Love Nicky desde yo estaba una Chica
Outfits 10/10💅💜💜💜
why did they allow a song like this to be on a kids film? It's disgusting
This is really bad
My new favorite song ❤
Kept seeing snap ads for this song lol that’s why I’m here
This songs bass in the theater on the credits was just the best thing ever
what the frick did i just here in the end SSlaaay!
those girls out there cant messing with these Barbie girls
Love the song Bich
listening to this for the 1st time : EW Second time : im a doll but i still wanna party 😍😍😍
40.5 million 🔥🔥
Ice spice is so trash
Tell ice spice I said u both are my besties and my favorite people 😭😭🥰
this song slaps so hard
Barbie!!
Every single one of my friends love this song❤❤🎉
The end credits really hit well with this
Quem tá dando aquela passadinha aqui depois de ver o filme ? Cena final do filme - coro de risadas no cinema - começa à queen Nicki Minaj cantando a braba 💕💕💕
скоро 50 миллионов
уже 40 миллионов
Miki es una barbie
❤😂😊 this is epic
Az új ribanc Barbi  már kapható 😂😂😂😂😂
PINK!
Give me back 2 minutes of my life
Am I the only one that thinks this song sucks
This is embarrassing, the vastly superior aqua.. playing in the background as a "sample"😂
Omg…This was litterally spoilers for the film!!
finally you got nickii
ngl its a little short no hate tho
amooo
Slayyyyyy Nicky and icespice I love you both so much❤❤❤ girl that’s song was slayyyyyy😊
💟 Gorgeous 🌸
AT THE THE END OF THE BARBIE MOVIE ME AND FRIENDS JUST STAYED AND DANCED TO THIS SONG LITERALLY LOVE THIS SO MUCHHH NICKI AND ICE SLAYY🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
NOT THIS BEING IN THE BARBIE MOVIE😭😭
I still like the old barbie song because this song is definitely not made for kids and the old one is from 12 years ago
This is a different level of pure MID on god
Where was aqua ?? 😭
Sounds horrible. They should've just used the Aqua Barbie girl song and that's it
Dam why y’all so pretty 🤩
I like
Reina del rap
Amo a la reina del rap
Amooooo ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is no one commenting on the length of this "song"??? Its literally 1:50 - the album version. That's barely an interlude jeez! These songs are getting shorter and shorter just for streaming sales #s while sacrificing their integrity at the same time. Granted it's most likely the labels pushing for that but still. No one wants a song they'll miss if they step out of the room for 30 seconds
THEEE BARBIE🦄
When a legend made a song it's perfect
Mothering
This is horrible. Poor young people gotta be exposed to this garbage.
All rap is the same, just talking, no melody, just talking with the same beat over and over, yet the mindless rappers rap on and the mindless minions hang on and on and on and on.
congrats on making it into the barbie film nicki !
Its so from pink friday album
Not the Weird Barbie of the end if you have watched the movie u Will know what am taking about
IF YOU SAY, IM ALWAYS YOURSSSS 💗👙🎀🩰
1:18  ON REPEAT 🔁
I watched Barbie the day after it came out and I was surprised to hear this song at the end lol
THATS GABAGE!!!!!
We did it
Its like watching a barbie commercial with music in the background
The best duo doesnt exi-
Mid
ME ENCANTO Y NO LA PUEDO DEJAR DE ESCUCHAR
Loveee it bruh slayyyy💅🏻😘☺️❤️

The colab I didn't know I needed. Just missing a non surgery iggy and anika with Megan  Rapping with Niki. She made it. I don't like her rapping party here tho. Why the camera moving so quick
queen 👸
People who hate go away whay did you click this video if you hate it ?
Ice spice 2.0 dababy sounding thecsame
This song is fire. Everywhere I go I heard that. I hear the song, it's like the best. Ice pies and that you will not do the best. It's killing the bar. But I don't like the other It's not far like you guys. You guys are the best fire people ever
why, just, why this?
Amazing. They take a decent song, put some illiterate talking overtop of it and ruin it.
This is the first time i see ice comfortable and loose. love it😊
😟
Is this supposed to be music?

👦🏿 I'm in my late 30s ... I saw earlier this summer Beyoncé for her RWT and now Barbie The Movie. And what else ? Mattel finally gave Nicki Minaj her flowers by allowing this epic duet with Ice Spice ! Well guys, i think the key of happiness is simply to enjoy fully every moment like these, remain grateful and never lose ur child-like spirit 💕 P.S : GO WATCH Barbie The Movie !!!
Why they put ice spice? Why ?? She doesn't know how to Rap and her voice is annoying
THEY SLAY SO HARD💘💘💘💘💘💘
Am I the only thinking  if the late Pop smoke  was alive to make a featuring this clip will be gasoline and match?👌
Barbie piruja,y Barbie Prepago😂😂😂😂😂😂
41million to go barbzzz !!!
Ruined the song thanks👌👏

Hearing this in theatres was next level 😍 as good as Black Panther (2018) end credits.
Bro I just listen to the song and clearly you can tell that this is one of Nicki Minaj's downfalls in music on top of it you can tell that ispice didn't write that verse because the way she's doing it you already know that it's wrote out from somebody else to her
Queen of Hip Hop 🤞🏾
🎀🩷🍬
The best part of this song is when she isnt the one singing
I love how Nicki, THE Barbz herself, actually married a Ken 😭❤
Much better the version of Aqua
te iubesc ice spice😍❤️
But they did the song for the song barbie
Even not able to create an entire new song. So talentless...
I love you 💖
Ice ateeee

FLUTTERSPICE IS EATINGGGGGGGGGG
Im a barbie gurl in a barbie worrrld
What is aqua
Depois de assistir o filme esse clip fica ainda melhor
I'm getting gender swapped 2000s rap video vibes (imagine Big Pimpin' or Candy Shop - but gender swapped!). Kinda loving it.
I was sobbing during billies song then the credits came up and this song was playing
Here before 40million views 💪🏿💪🏽💪🏻
IM A MUNCH!
Nicki and Ice Spice is always 🔥 🔥 🔥 together. It girls❤❤❤❤
I just realized at the end these two become the weird Barbies because their hair gets cut, they get drawn on, and they’re doing the splits.
Shoutout to Ms Hannah LUX 💕
E os pais levando seus filhos de 7 anos pra assistir achando que é um filme infantil 😂😂😂😂
Playing this for my grandpa atm
This was at the end of the new Barbie movie I recognized ice spice singing
I'm always Listen your song nicki 🥰🥰
i love the barbie refrences in this
Pretty
And ice spice
NICKI IS BODY GOALS FRRRRRR
Omg the slay! End xd
Nicki is the goat and also the real Barbie
Very cool to see black/brown women represent Barbie! 🤎🩷🖤
💖💞💘💗💕💝
Very nice song I love it so much but the problem I have am not barbie girl because am too big
Way to drown out aqua with this awful music
I Would Probably Get Copyright if i try doing a Song Cover of this song
Let's go 40M barbs!
That movie was FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Pink is fabulous all day every day, honey🩷
Tasteless and untalented performer as well as “instrumental”. Her dogs could probably do a better job of resampling and arrangement than her “producers”.  She needs to go back to “exotic dancing”.  She got lucky that Mattel had a lawsuit against Aqua, otherwise they would never use her on the soundtrack.
Pegasus trippy red barbie
Tell me why this was playing at the end of the Barbie movie😂😂❤❤❤
Super hit ☄️
The thumbnail lolll what happened ☠️
“Barbie Corriente”
Those 2 women are gross.
Nicki. Queen. Period.🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THE BARBIE MOVIE ACTUALLY INCLUDED THIS SONG AT THE CREDITS

Barbie today is not a person anymore it's the character
Old barbie don't rap

I prefer this than Barbie Girl song by Aqua 😅
Nick you are amazing the most amazing woman 👠♀️ you are the true babie
How do you fit a sponsor for olipop in a music video about Barbie
Get dem @nickiminaj and @icespice .
About to return to the top ten next week 😊 It's a certified hit, your honor 🔥
Sad that little girls will go watch this movie come home to listen to the soundtrack and see this… we’ll done America you’ve created great “role models” in the female youth

I'm so tired of seeing little girls dressed like this. :( I would love something that could be shown to children because barbie is every little girls favorite.
This is horrible specially if it’s from them like to a Barbie movie for teens

The best to this song is the same from the remix of walking to the moon 😮 hopefully no law suits 😅 good song tho!
Nicki making the song for Barbie movie is one of the greatest moments in her story arc
Btw I just watched the Barbie  movie it’s SO GOOD❤❤️‍🔥✨⚡️💖💅🏽🌷🤍
Nicki Minaj es la Barbie subida de tono.
Make a noise, you need to change that
They are not 10s
ICE SPICE REALLY HIT IT I LIKE HER😏😉
I'm excited that nicki gets to be a barbie fr this time BUT THIS SONG SUCKS. its a glorified ad n I wish it was actually good bc it'd be such a slay if it was 😢😢

The fact the movie theater put this song on after Barbie’s new movie came out😂
I don’t know who Ice Spice is but she trash.
😘😘😘✌️✌️✌️
Ice spice got so mad when she picked up those doilies, intricate woven tapestry often placed on tables or hung on walls in frames.
I'm surprised I like this
ate and devoured
HI BARBIEEEEEEEEE
It SUCKS compared to the OG song. I don't get why you sample a better song 🤦
Ice Spice ruined the song....
In 2011 I bought a BARBIE chain bc of Mincky Minach <3
时间太短了

The only redeemable part of this song is sampling Aqua in the background, the rest is garbage. Should’ve just used the original.
Completely ruined it

Ice spice a depassé Nicki Minaj dans ce morceau
Cant believe this😂 ice spice every song (stop playing whit them riot)😂😂❤
I feel like the movie is non inclusive. They have chosen all biological female characters to play females. They should have casted some female actress that was not a biological female to prove that "gender is what you chose to be"
Fr fire🧞‍♀️💕🔫
Smh we aren't allowed attractive women in music videos anymore. BTW why the M1 Finance ad in the music video? So confusing
Need the unghetto matheiu Barbie world remix
Mattel prohibió la canción porque segun ellos Aquq sexualizaba a ka muñeca, entonces...???? Me quedo con la original, es iconica y divertida!
Bow you worm hanging from a tree

Ice Spice!?!?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS NICKIIIIII AHHHHHHHH

THEYYYY ATE DOWNNNNNN- YUHHHHHH
I'm not being rude but I can't understand what Ice Spice is saying 🤧
That's so FANTASTIC. 😍 💗
so fire I could watch it on mute.
Nicki Minaj never disappoints , this definitely #1 worthy. ❤
Why would a sound track thats supposed to promo a movie, have product placement for other products??
The cgi 😭🫱
I can't stop listening to this 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️
Slay
What age group is this aimed at :/
Awful 👍 barbie was classy not slaggy but hey ho it's for the kids though 🙈 cuz for some reason this generation is intent on destroying kids for money 👍
That's why i don't let my kids use phone

ششووغغغغللللل 🤪🌪 .
Something about the verses don't seem to sound right with the sampled Barbie song. Like the rap was desperately trying to catch up with the fast beats.
Nicki fits any kind of music.  What a legend
Me enamore de la pelo naranja
I like this collab.
And we eat playing tag yaaa
La mejor parte es cuando la quitas y pones esta joya 🎉🎉🎉  https://youtu.be/ZyhrYis509A

It could’ve been a lot harder.
I get chills when Ice Spice starts naming off Barbies like her dead opps. That part was so hard 😈
The worst!
What's an estimate on how much Aqua will earn from this sampling?
So digusting. Just a wh…re video.

PINK BARBIE DREAMBOUSE
The song is very catchy i admit but its also annoying with the overall message 😏
came from the barbie movie💀💀
Oui oui
I didn’t think Nikki needed ice spice in this video.
Niki isnt a real musician. She doesnt have talent
Most beautiful 😍❤️ I love it❤
Ice spice is so hard to understand, I get about 10% of whatever she's saying in hetlr songs
38m views is coming, lest go barbz 🩷
Congratsssssss Lattttttoooooooo🎉💐🥳🤩Aaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeee #1 Babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Ice Spice gives me goosebumps, she’s so beautiful and has a laid back voice
Que lixo de clipe é música

Ice so fortunate to have Nicki by her side
Worst song remake ever! 🖕👎
Keep views up Barbz 💅🏽💕Nicki Barbie is what we dream of 🥰
Somehow Aquas song is the most interesting thing I hear in this song. Everything else sounds like it was done in 5 minutes :/
Little M1 finance plug

Omg they turned them into the weird Barbie at the end. You wouldn’t get it until you see the movie 😭
How come nikki looked old on this and ice spice looks so young
the best duo also yall r real barbies
I Would buy Nicki And Ice Spice Barbies‼️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
They should collaborate again!
The original Barbie girl is better.
This is trash. How can so many of you think it's good? How do you judge music? What are you hearing that I am not?
I watched this before deciding to go to the movie.  If this OMV is representative of the movie, I am staying far, far away and wouldn't let any child under 15 watch that movie.  Far to adult for the kids the dolls were made for.
I honestly love this song for the movie
Wow... talk about being in your element!!! Loving it!!!!
Who can't wait to see BARBIE 🙌🏽✨
Nice mixing 💕
Original is much better!!!
This video is so cute!!!!!!💕🌸💕🌸💕🌸💕🌸
AMO ESSE HIT VEYR 🦄💗💕

i just need real music played by real musicians.
Nice cancion

Nice version of the song but personally I love the original aqua version better and it is my childhood song

Al final de la pelo este temaso ufff
What an absolute load of garbage!!!!!
Shee didn't mention Skipper
Play it play it justvince more
They littarly were giving us hints of the barbie movie😅
How they knew what will be in barbie film?
🌶️ X 🍑
I love how nicki says “rag, will he spank me when I get bad” her voice is just it!! Like that’s literally everything I need from this song!
Yall this song at the end of the barbie movie was chefs kiss
Hi I'm a big fan of you BTW I'm 8❤️❤️❤️
Y’all slayed to Much
As a boy this song goes so hard the rap the beat just suits the movie and just good for a vibe in the future
The both are Barbies 😻✋
I love iSpy❤
Ice spice look like a albino with Down syndrome js
This work of art was featured in the Barbie movie credits, with all Barbie dolls!! I didn't know there was a barbie with a TV on her back 🤔
This music is becoming tired
🔥🔥🔥
LOVE IT!!! Its at the end of the Barbie movie!
Yikes this is brutal! Teaching kids to be hoes well done
Eww..
Worst rap song that ever came out in history of the rap genre.
Blessing eyes 😂❤
HERMANO, SON LA DUPLA PERFECTA
This song cam out in like 2018 or 19 Nicki has been taliking about Barbie since like 2007. Barbie the movie finally caught up to Nicki and she getting a bag to re-release ine if her previous songs. I'm not mad at it. ❤❤❤❤❤
I thought the movie was for kids?!! Failed society
barbie world to #1
OMG this is perfect 💅  SsSSslLlLlAAaAaayYyYyy😂
Vengo de ver barbie 💓
This reminded me of the song, best friend because they both you and Barbie
Una basura de canción para la peli y eso que no me gusta pero se que fue un buen trabajo Barbie gril y eso trato de ser alusión a ese tema pero es un trabajo basura, moda, mediocre y que solo sirvió para que niki siguiera creyéndose una cantante ruda pero sensual (lo cual no es) que poco talento
Think this could’ve been done way better and they could have looked a lot better too unfortunately
Ice Spice seems so genuine. I'm happy to see her living (what looks like) her dream!
6# lugar no spotify global Barbz!!😍😍😍😍
barbieland XDDD
Nah...The original is still better.
I love their style
Super power girls
Oh mami
Go Barbie bit!hes    You slay ice spice 🤪🤪
Well I guess my little sister is going to listen to this on repeat
Nicki deserves this song to herself. Ice Spice is awkward af, can't even lip sync her own lyrics and brings down the whole energy. Nicki drops bars and Ice drops benzos.
Disgusting
IT GALS AND WE IT PLAYIN TAG
❤❤❤❤
𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝖊𝖓𝖉.... 𝖘𝖑𝖆𝖞!!!
Argentina wants to cancel nicki and ice spice for being black 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

😮
STREAMMMMMMMMMMM

This was legit in the film 😂
I wanted the Aqua version of Barbie girl to be in film. Heard this version in cinema, amazing.
The song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
awful
This remix sucks!
I’m 9 but this song still slap
Ice spice is dumpster trash, how tf do ppl like her "music" she got 3rd grade rhymes. And sound the same on all her stuff
Sounds like a bunch of trash
Still watching this when this came out
POV: u went to see the new Barbie movie and they played it at the end
God loves you and he wants to save everyone 🙏🏾❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎼🎤💯🎥
Good job taking a decent song and turning it into a degenerate abomination.  This song is just another straw in the stack of the downfall of music.
Ewe
Let’s get to 40m barbz asap barbz

Hi, Barbie.
I want this to won a Grammy so bad.. How iconic
This is awful. Sorry.
No hurt....But much better the original song by: Aqua
I was at the drive in movies yesterday and when this played at the end I was about to scream so hard I didn't even knew that was coming.❤ proud of you Nicki ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Why is every Ice Spice song over this same beat. Like a Pop Smoke beat. A few they just changed the tempo of it. But literally same beat.
I've spice has massively improved and upgraded. I'm really happy for her, especially when I remember her humble beginnings.
Icenika best🔥😊

Not the kids saying slay at the end 🤣
SLAY😝💅🏻✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nickiiiiiii
Ah yes indoctrinate the children into following these artists who promote hyper sexuality and using your body to get what you want. I shouldn’t expect anything less out of the industry.
The best part of this is the sample in the background. Absolute gash.
Help why is this song in the barbie movie
I love you 💕💕💕💖💖💖💕💕💖💕💕💖💕💕💖💖💖💕💖💖💖💕💖💕💖💖💖💖💕💕💖💖💕💖💖💕💕💕

Okay the Barbie movie was literally one of the worst movies but you can't deny that this song goes hard
Aqua may have been a one-hit-wonder in the U.S., but 26 years later, people reminder their one-hit-wonder. I guarantee you nobody will remember this song by this time next year.

I hate to admit it, but this goes hard 😂
i noticed this started gaining views faster after the movie came out, i love it😂
I don't follow Nicki Minaj nor Ice Spice's work, but after how they managed to include Barbie Girl in the movie despite the strained relationship between Mattel and Aqua, they have my respect.
Please 🥺🥺🥺🥺  delete this video from internet
Guys!! I'm a real Barbie gurl!
SLAYYY

"I have become Barbie Girl, Destroyer of Barbie worlds..." -Atomic Scientist Barbenheimer
Nicki you my queen 👑🎧🫂🇿🇦
Foda que esse clipe, apesar de ter sido lançado há 1 mês atrás, possuí referências sobre o filme que só podem ser compreendidas por aquelas pessoas que vieram rever a música APÓS assistirem o filme da Barbie.  Isso foi de uma jogada tão boa, que só poderia ter sido feita pela queen Nick Minaj.
SLAY ❤❤❤
Nicki has been singing about being a Barbie since the beginning of her career and now she has actually made a song for the actual Barbie film 😭.
This is atrocious lol
Lets be honest we not payin attention to the song we payin attention to something else
Welp. This is terrible
Comin for 40 Million ViewSS😍
Not gonna like 0:42 the beat slaps so hard in the clubs. Got grown men twerking 😭
No offense but with a music video with so much exposure why is it in a kids movie?

Ice spice and Nicki Minaj slayed so good 😝

The fact the movies played this song at the end of the Barbie movie
Didn’t expect this music video NAHHH THIS FIRE NICKI MINAJ AND ICE SPICE
It's sad that so many women have Barbie Doll syndrome. They go above and beyond to try to look beautiful on the outside, but lack the beauty on the inside.
I love Nicki Minaj and spice together it’s like the cutest duo.who agrees wit me
We need a Barbie real movie now
💯
I cant tell how many times ice spice said pin-
2pac is watching in heaven
Literally the song was at the end of the movie😂
Emm cuando nicky y ice spice estan en la moto con esa ropa creo q algunos chicos se fijan mas😶 no se eso pienso pero amo a nicky :)
The 2 girls at the beginning and end are so iconic
Stream hard Barbz
Today I watch the Bobby movie and I love your song
Not goin lie, this hard
As soon as I heard this song at the end of the movie I was like where's the original song at and someone told me this was it and said it was Nicki Minaj I was like why don't you just be original not everything has to have rap in it and I heard a lot of people complain about the fact that they didn't have the original song in this
Aqua Forever Barbie Girl💗💗💗💗
Whoever sleeping on Nicki is deaf dumb as she said 👌🏽
nicki minaj ruined barbie
best song ❤
Horrible 💩
Old School Nicki   Man I am old
this song gots me playing evry single hour of the day
"Oh my *GAWD* dis is perfect!"   Was perfect :)
😂😂😂😮😮😮
Barsss
Slay
Pfft. That moment when Nicki throws them all Lolipop. XD  Those are pretty good though, we sell them where I work.  Also, I wasn't previously familar Ice Spice, but I like her sound. Didn't get much of it here since she was only the guest artist, but she's got something in the way she lays out her rhymes that just draws you in.
Canción Zzzzz
Man! Nicki gives me goosebumps! She still got it and still doing her thing!
Those GRAH, DEYUMN are the cringiest part of this song. Seriously!
Such a good combo😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why do they have to use bad words ...its for kids
🔥🔥🔥
🤮
Nah this version of barbie isnt barbie. The old version was way better.
Nicki Minaj is the reason I went to watch out Barbie movie on day 1 ❤️
💕

GYAT!!!!!!
I like the original better simply cause i like that style of music better, but this is pretty dope. Im excited for the movie.
It was nice of you to add Ice Spice, not sure what she added. Crazy Mattel was happy with this but not Aqua's version
this playing after the ending scene is SO UNSERIOUS
No one can beat to the Queen of rap !! Periot !!💋💅
Hi Barbies again 😘
Lol. So now all the artists wanna be dolls. First shensea.... n now nicki n ice
La original es mil veces mejor…
The beat is 🔥
Best animated plastic doll music video ever made😂
I think I just threw up in my mouth.
I heard this on tiktok
😮 Omg this version is extremely horrible and can't ever compare to the original. Sorry but it sincerely sucks and the original sample playing in the background is too low. The whole thing is way too boring. You two should have just covered the song and sung some of the lines in hip-hop rap style. This version is cheap and not memorable at all. Sorry but I'm being honest with you. Aqua's version is perfect and you could have done a fun new twist on it if you just kept it loyal to the original.
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Randy Marsh has never been so relatable...

This song it's so iconic ♡♡♡
Aquí los que sólo escucharon a Aqus al fondo y no le pusieron atencion a la nueva versión.
awful
I love the “makeover” at the end because we all did that to our Barbies and messed them up!😅
Props to AQUA for creating the everlasting bop
I was NOT expecting this song at the end of the movie 😂😂😂😂
@dolxmi true
It's not bad. I'm a huge Nicki fan. But in my opinion it would be a lot better without the backtrack. Is there an edited fan version somewhere? I want to listen to the rap part without the "I'm a barbie girl" in the background. It's there the entire time... Why not rap - chorus - rap - chorus? My brain doesn't like that mess :-(
I am gentleman, but still used to start my day with this track of Nicki on my speaker with full basssss. And my earth change from blue to pink.  It's fantastic.
People whon didn’t come from tiktok are allowed to like this

Nicki Minaj ❤❤

Shitiest song I ever heard till now
I thought this movie was for kids. Yikes.  And to think that Mattel at one point sued the record label for" Barbie Girl" because they claimed the song sexualized barbie. Yet here with have this 26 years later.

Is nobody else going to admit how terrible this song is 😂
ITS BARBIE
Ateee ❤
The barbie movie was good, it came out july 21st but I seen it today on july 22nd. Margot Robbie as Barbie played her role good, just as much as Ryan Gosling as Ken.

Please like this comment, I want to be remember that am here in 60 years coming.
Nicki needs to do a song with RA the Rugged Man.
I'm sorry I don't care about this  Redo of the original  Barbieworld song they should have brought them back and  Redo the song like before but that just me 🤷‍♂️
Smh all of y’all naive just like ice spice she don’t understand what Nicki is doing…she sticking around ice spice because she’s hot right now and knowing nicki’s stardom power can help ice spice but Nicki is gaining more than ice spice making it seem like ice spice needs her to pop more like ice spice will be irrelevant by next year and Nicki will just be Nicki who use others as stepping stones
J'adore 💕 😍
Btw your song played at the new barbie  show on the cinema I was at

Thank God the dislike button is still there, even though it is good for nothing, but yeah..
Alguém põe o vocal da Kelly Key no lugar do Aqua 🙏🙏
I’m bad like the Barbie
Esta en algo 🔥 por el fondo
NICKIIIIII
Me gusta más la de Aqua esta es fea
Is this what they were referring to when they said the film was "feminist"? 🙄🤦
Barbi shouldn’t be a rap song
You can tell the Nicki Minaj Barbz here in Wyoming after the movie coz ya Barbz was singing and dancing while credits rolled and others walked out we #Outchere
The movie was bomb very empowering for all women ages 10- 80 everyone that’s a women should go watch and enjoy this empowering movie #Barbz4Life

So beautiful voice
I thought Lil Kim was black barbie. Dressed in Bulgari tryna leave in somebody's Ferrari.
My new favourite duo
The weird contrast between the original song and this one is wild, from criticism to glorification, it's got my brain twisted
YALL ATE THIS UPPPP😋😋🤤
WE MAKING IT OUT THE BARBIE HOUSE WITH THIS ONE 🔥
Where's aqua in this
Ice spice + nicki minaj + aqua best trio
real
The fact that I just got the barbie movie ad 💀
People who didn’t come from the Barbie movie 👇
I lasted 29 seconds. This is bad.
😱😱😀😀👌👌👌👌
Slayyyy
Wow is this a real song?? Soooo generic and terrible!!! Theyre just talking... two thumbs down! Just stop already
Your song added so much to the Barbie movie
I love the pink 💗
they gave so much hints of the new Barbie movie
One of them looks like Annabelle the doll thoe
first time hearing this
Love it you ate that girl slayy
This song is so addictive LITERALLY can't stop listening!! ❤❤
años que no veia a mi verdadera nicki <3 como en starship, highschool y +
Now I understand what you meant by I'm bad like the Barbie (movie)
Straight 🗑
Hmm no, I still prefer barbie girl(I don't hate the song).
OK, probably unpopular opinion here.  I find it ironic that Mattel found the Aqua song so offensive it launched a massive lawsuit against the band.  But it's just fine with the lyrics of this version.  Times change I guess.
I go to dance and we do this dance in hip hop 😁
Esa canción suena al final de la película.
the last part is me when i was 7💀
SlAY BAD BARBIE GROUP😝
IT GALS.
Like if you’re here from the barbie movie 🎀
0:05 SLAYYY
The original as maligned as it was at the time is still the superior song though if there is money there to be taken then kudos to Aqua for taking it. It’s not as if the studio would use the original song in the soundtrack since it’s actually a pretty scathing commentary of the whole Barbie image of ditsy materialism.
Nicki and ice are so pretty
💕NICKI💕ICE SPICE💕
THIS SONG SLAYS ❤
🌸🌸🌸
Something about nicki in pink mullets >>
The fighter she is lol
The Queen and Princess of Rap 😍I love it
This Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nicki and ice make music for pretty people only
The moment when Barbie turns into a trap queen 😢
This is trash
And they couldnt play the original song at the end? This version is trash
All of the Barbies is pretty 😍
Best Oppenheimer soundtrack
Ima barbie girl

🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮
The way Nicki Minaj is still rocking with the new girls is GOLD
It would be perfect if only the original BARBIE GIRL  song appeared in the movie instead of this lame rip-off. The vibes aren't just the same.
Top Global M/V No.90 ✨

BARBIE IF U STILL IN DOUBTTTTT
it's amazing how this song manages to represent the female power of barbie
W song fr
SLAY
No offense but as much as I love Nikki Minaj and Ice Spice and this is my first time listening to "Barbie World", I hate to say this but Aqua's "Barbie Girl" is and always will be a trillion times better. It sucks that "Barbie Girl" wasn't in the movie all because of Mattel's feud with Aqua. Thank you Aqua for the classic and best original song ever. 💯
Lo que es querer colgarte de un éxito pero lo que haces es arruinar  un éxito
Cardi b fans but u always rock ❤
i am men
Sorry but Ice killed Nicki lyrically on this
AQUA is the best! Legendary song. This is just vulgarity
amazing ❤️
Who else is here after the movie 🙋🏽‍♂️🫵🏽

Enserio esto saldra en la pelicula??? Es horrible😂
SLAYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤
I still don't understand why women in western culture think showing their bodies is their freedom. When I see such vulgarity, I can only assume she is not ashamed and has no culture, which is why she would act in a song in such a shameless way. This nonsense is done here for the sake of money and fame. But one day she will lose all the money that she earned by showing her body to people without any shame, like a softcore actress.

This video is so F doPe
So hot❤❤
HELP WHY IS THIS VIDEO SO FUNNY
0:38 LA MEJOR PARTE😭❤️
Its a no for me Dawg. Song is not memorable, unlike Aqua legendary hit. This song will not be remembered a year from now let alone 20 yrs. Dissapointed that Niki converted to this new style of rap flow to stay relevant instead of owning the lane that she created. I dont know these mediocre drill beats with the same flow and bop is unoriginal and whack. I expected more from Niki.
Ya'll this movie is fabulous, and this song is the perfect capper.
SLAY QUEEN

This ain't it chef.
Por que se escucha el tema original de fondo? Se mezcla todo! Parece qué habla por telefono y dejo la musica de fondo 😅
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Why is this the best duo? LIKE THEIR VOICES WORK SO WELL WITH EACH OTHER  Ice Spice and Nicki is just a duo I’ve never known I needed, but I love it. They slay fr
💅
Utter trash
👏👏🩷
The fact this song is at the end of the Barbie movie makes me so happy
She definitely in the (Link )if you know then you know
Horrible! 1’50” ? What happened? 9 songs writes ? 😂😂😂😂 😂. This is the worst song I’ve heard in years.

Hi BARBIE!!
Change the thumbnail immediately please lol😂
This song sounds like the end of the Barbie movie. Nice song
Rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas ❤🎉rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas ❤
HI BAAAARBIE ❤😊
I first heard Barbie Girl when i was 5 back in 2000 and my 5yo self couldn’t be more proud of how far the song has come 🥹😭🩷
Jajajaja de Barbie no tienen nadaaaaaa 😂😂😂😂 puro sheetttt
Ice Spice should do asmr...her voice sounds super velvety.
Niki Minaj and ice are the Barbies but the awful an cheap babie
Two years ago, we got a remix of Pump Up The Jam for "Space Jam: A New Legacy," now we got a remix of sorts to Aqua's "Barbie Girl." I feel like I'm in the 90s once more, my childhood era.
cringe
its so bad 💀
wow what a way to ruin a great song
int no way Nicki 40 she look 25
Vid concept reminds me a lil of the Mariah and Nicki vid for “Up Out My Face”. Interesting that Nicki was the young 20 something doll opposite Mariah, who was 40. And now Nicki is 40, and Ice is  playing the young doll in this one. The circle of life.
Yo pls tell me this is in the movie plssss
1:17 the best part❤
Pop Smoke whole flow copied
Queen and princess!!
Where all my Barbie girls at?
nicky minaj and ice spice are the best duo
Cringe
Thank'u  Obama this is A masterpiece
How ice spice not driving the car. Maybe because it's a B!CH

Here we go again with YouTube... stoping the views at the same tired a$$  33million. ...imagine a global movie soundtrack song that has been pushed EVERYWHERE by a global icon (Nicki) and a popular new up coming artist (ice) and the views are stuck at 33million  YouTube is definitely not fooling anyone.

The worst of the worst songs I've ever heard
0:10
Horrible!!!
M1 Finance Ad!! 1:31 anyone notice that?
Hit🎉
Finally after suing them, it all came together full circle decades later
Whilst even Lene Nyström is a bit too plastic for my taste (conviviall in person, certainly), this does give a handful of Danish/Norwegian tax payers a bit more income. And that is not bad.
❤
I like the old thumbnail of nicki looking blurry with eyes like 🙄 lol!!!
Haha yeah a 10 in your dreams honestly if you think that then you need to have a reality check. Your both 4s at most 😂😂😂😂😂
No one better to sing a song about a plastic doll, than a woman full of plastic.
this duo is such a hot badass 🔥🎉
All of the barbie's is pretty ❤ You reading this just know your pretty ❤!
I don’t really like this the old one is better
1:19
This music video is a lot better after watching the barbie movie.

Just watched Barbie and got surprised by this song at the end credit 😭
Ice spice leveled t.f up❤❤
Slay! Girl  slayyyy  love it
Love you guys
Those should be the example for the new generation….. pouffiasses (French word)
oppenheimer vs barbie oppenheimer= like Barbie= Comment
La mejor parte es cuando la quitas y pones la original del grupo Aqua
I think they made this song just to include the og song in the movie and not get sued....
Cagaron la canción de Aqua
My mom was Vibing to this and her mood changed to angry after I told her Nicky Minaj sang this for some reason she hates Nicky Minaj and most black people she said ima be grounded for life if I listen to Nicky Minaj around her
Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, are Literally the best Collab, They literally can’t stop making music together, Their Collabs are blowing up.
This song is perfect tbh
The  SLAY  For me💀💀
Ngl they built like a Barbie with all that plastic
They should be in movie together like call it “Fresh meat” as they enter in college as freshman students but they should be shy then at college they blossom.
Ok where can I get theses Barbies at 🙏🙏🙏
Cra
They are a great duo.
I love love love this song

Better than the original 🔥🔥
As Hetero as I am I'm excited for the Barbie movie. It looks funny to me. Plus you got great actors in it. Margot Robbie's gonna be great as Barbie and Ryan Gosling's gonna hit another home run probably.
Huh dis fer children?
Barbie is tall blond and skinny just a reminder

Sei tutto tranne che Barbie la volgarità assoluta 😢

Y pensar que Mattel demandó a Aqua por sexualizar a Barbie. Y esto qué onda? 🤡 En fin, la hipotenusa 😂
Is this something that we do now? Take a piece of verse and put ur on song on to?  I'll go back and listen original
I LOVE NICKI AND ICE SPICE SO MUCH!!!! This is such a boppppp
I love this song esp ice’s verse
They should drop a album together frl

The SLAY
Horrible !

I expected more creativity from this video. Love the song. Expected more out the video though. The sample track has such a classic and creative video that this should’ve followed suit.
GOT MY TICKET TO SEE THE MOVIEE I'M WAITING TO SEE MY BARBZ THEREE
Yooooo YouTube music has comment sections now yay :D
I like that its already clean so i dont have to search specifically for it
I thought Niki said she was a Christian. I thought she was faking but now I know she is.

I swear it sounded like JoJo Siwa at the end
Worst song ever 🤮🤮🤮🤮

Most tiktok rap is better than this nauseating song.
Que le hicieron 😭
Female Wolves Eeeeeeeee Walkkkkkk
Who is waiting Nicki and Ice sing the chorus? Like i was expecting the chorus will be sung by both of them and not just as a rap sample. At least Ava Max's Not Your Barbie Girl still has the chorus in it
Barbie Female Wolves💜💜👄🩷🩷
What can I say? It’s her world, I’m just living in it.  #JustKen
Barbie b!tch ❤❤💅🏾💅🏻

Really goes to show how downhill Barbie is going if they have to get two rap artists that are mid at best and who have to use fake butts to sell their product.

*Does anyone here know who made the beat?*
Nicki & Ice Spice Only Need 2:10 Minutes to slayyyyy❤💅💅
slay
Nicki does the barbie thing with no effort 🩷
THEY SO PRETTY AND THEY SLAYYY
Can we see behind the scenes???
I was a 10 year old boy when Barbie Girl was released in 1997. And I can say that at least here in Scandinavia, it wasn't seen as a song "just for girls". Us boys went nuts for it too as it was just so catchy, and Aqua was one of the most popular groups here for the rest of the 90's.
Oh I didn't understand anything people
Por que a Nicki Minaj não foi escolhida para interpretar a Barbie, hein? A mulher sempre foi a mais Barbie Girl de todasssss!!!
Approved from South Africa 🇿🇦🤍💗 I'm lost of words... Creativity on 100. Sweets!
👹IT IS BARBIE B!CH IF UR STILL IN DOUBT👹🤣🤣🤣
The best duo of the year ice pice and you
🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
THE WAY THEY ALL SAID “SLAYYYY” AT THE ENDD

Nice.
Remember when Nicki was original and inventive? She used to be a TRUE performance artist like Debra Harry and Lady Gaga.
This song trash
This isn’t music, this is consumerism
This is the collab we all needed!👏👏👏
This song is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
الباربي ماكانت سوده وجيكره وفخوذها كبيره وركبها سود 😂😂😂 وع كرهتيني بالشخصيه😂😂😂😂

THIS WAS IN THE BARBIE FILM
I love how the girls cut their hair and drew on them at the end because that’s exactly what we used to do to our Barbie dolls
I would love to see a separate video of the choreography of the background dancers

Slayyyyyyyy 🎀✨✨
Tanto problema que le hizo Mattel al grupo Aqua por esta canción en los años 97 y al final Mattel terminó utilizando la canción para la película porque por más que la cante esta otra cantante el fondo de la canción es la de Aqua
Wow unghetto made a song like this called plastic
Nicki started out smooth and then boom 🤯🤯 amazing
🤢🤮
Omg your so pretty ✨
This was trash
It’s sad to see that artists like her are considered global icons! Thanks for ruining my childhood… 😡😡😡
Omg this Barbie movie is getting so much hype-
Yasss the olipop

Aqua's barbie is still better
Nicki carried this song.
it's true that she has so much plastic in her that we can consider her as a barbie 🤣
jprdle ale żenada, w porównaniu z oryginałem...
1:08 is my fav part like she looks so good when she says "the f** they goin' say now??"

I love this!! But lil kim n Nikki should've done this together n Gaggged the world

They ain’t 10’s they are 10,000😂
Aqua was my childhood... Just saying 😊
This just didn't do it for me. The rapping, the visuals, the choreography was like NOTHING...I was waiting for something to happen the entire time. Disappointed.
the fact that ice spice carried this song sounds crazy to me
I feel it's about to be Nicki's year again❤ Queen never disappoints

Nicki so wishes she was a white chick 😂
OMG Barbie is black 😮

This feels boring and repetative, not for me.
It's been 3 weeks since this song got released and i still don't know why, but this is kinda fire hahaha
I’m sorry, but that is the most shittiest songs I’ve ever heard🤬
me and my dear family played this at my dear sister lar lars funeral. she was rolling her grave with happiness.
Mejor la original
What was wrong with the original aqua song?
Successfully  ruined a masterpeice song 😊
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Help
You can’t just take other peoples songs nicki stinky Minaj
Hi Nicki
🔥🔥🔥
NPC music asf, sounds like six year old made
Omg Nicki you my idol and ice spice too💗💗😍
Que me expliquen que ritmo tiene esto.
Esta cancion esta bien horrible, no se porque les gusta This song is very horrible, I don't know why they like it
"I be dragging her so she bald a bit"😂
The original song is better
I LOVE YOU 😊😊
Prefiero la versión de Aqua "Barbie Girl"
I’m sorry but I need the dolls yall are so slay ❤🎉 😍
Ice Spice is cool.. However, she is so lucky to have this opportunity because I don't see her lasting in the music world very long. It's too over saturated, and she sounds like BIA and a few others. Lol
Isis pink hair actually eats
This song is so fire
YALLL HOLD UPP.TELL ME THAT THIS ISNT A SICK NAME FOR THIS DUO. NICE MICE OR NICE SPINAJ aka nice spinach OR ICKY SPICE.its soo funny
Really???' This SUCKS! What a shame!
40M ❤
Definitely better than the supposed original with Icy she need to at least admit that but it's okay we ALL understand 💯
1:57 slayyyy
Era hacer una nueva versión de la canción, no hacer un rap y poner la canción de fondo 🤦
They stole mabu's flow
1M like 🤒 & 40M vu barrbz !! 🙄🙄
I pray they release those ice spice and nicki Minaj barbie dolls 😭💕💞💝💖💘
muñecas plásticas en la vida real haciendo la peor canción de una muñeca plástica🥱
Great music video
The end got me 😂
I was a 10 year old boy when Barbie Girl was released in 1997. And I can say that at least here in Scandinavia, it wasn't seen as a song "just for girls". Us boys went nuts for it too as it was just so catchy, and Aqua was one of the most popular groups here for the rest of the 90's.
their voices sound so good together
This song sucks
Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice: best duo
OMG  This Song So Trendy
"im a 10 so I'm pullin a ken🙄💅" goes hardd
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Original will always be the best
So slay in the end
Who from Trinidad 🇹🇹
I love how Nicki sings like Barbie 😍💗
*This duo* 💕💟❣
Perfectttttt 🤩
😢😢😢😢 not original song
Trash.
You slayed
its new baby drill congrats
🥱🥱🥱😴
I love you Nick 🇹🇿
omg, I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG, IT IS BRINGING MY CHILDHOOD BACK all over again!!
So much for Lil' Kim who stated that she (herself) brought new music to their genre. 😢
Bruh been listening to this on Spotify didn’t know there was a music video 😭
So fun black godless misguided miserable gangsta "music" still still rules & reigns in their Black gangsta Barbie worlds?! 🤯🤮🎸🎤🎼🎵🎙🏝🧭🗽🍾🎂🍿🥗
Is Mattel making these Nicki and Ice Spice Dolls????
The queen never disappoint ❤❤
Είναι πάνω στο τζετ σκιι
🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ready to risk it all 😮‍💨
YEAHHHH
❤❤❤❤
This is trash! The old song is way better in miles. They even needed to take sample from Barbie Girl. How lame!
Queens 💕🎀
nicki and ice spice be besties now 😊😊
Good song

Barbie ué vc não tem noção 0:40

This is horrendous.  Give it a couple years - see if it lives up to the old Aqua song from 1997, over 25 years ago.... you know it won't.  Horrible.
Am i the only one that doesn't like this song..i mean its kind of cringe😂
my one word to describe this, : GYAATTTTTTT
I FREAKING LOVE THIS
This was amazing!

Disappointing - you can barely hear Aqua. They just should have the Aqua song from 1997 on the soundtrack, or at least both of them. I mean, come on, the movie is Barbie and someone already did a great song about Barbie!

Interesting rendition of the original "Barbie Girl" song... still get a laugh that, for all the bad blood between Mattel and Aqua about the original version, Aqua's version is STILL the one most associated with Barbie...
It’s good it’s. No bad words love nickii!
Barbz keep str£@m!ng and buying
That flip on that beat was niiiiiiiice
Why you still making music without Christian Combs

The beat is Dope! Nicki NEVER disappoints
No because why did they do Nicki and Ice Spice’s Barbies like that at the end 😭😭
1:20 “I keep dragging her, so she bald a bit” queen material

Everything she touches is gold. Love she made an adult version of a classic that isn’t outwardly raunchy.

How sanitised will the radio edit need to be for the movie?!!
Obsessed
ice spice and nicki minaj work too well together <3
So much for claiming to be Barbie for years couldn’t even get to play the actual role!!😂🎉😢 ima b a troll like the “Barbie” is 😂 surprised she didn’t throw a tantrum for it😂
Nicki❤❤
Dry even nicki don't even sound enthusiastic smh we're is the energy ughhh
This song dope asf
I get it it’s still Barbies, but you could’ve use brat because brats are prettier than Barbies to come to think about it
Ice Spice’s face creeps me out but I kinda like her still
Nick never Disappointed
ATEEEEE
Ice has Down syndrome ?
Top Top Top!!! Nicki QUEEN!!!💕💌♥️💝
Perfeitassssss
Barbie World = 30 million Barbie Girl = 1244 million
I think I downloaded the adult version of Barbie lol 😂
IQ = - infinity
I heard it on the radio today.
Slaayyyy!!
❤️

How is this even a song
brrrrrr
ALL OF THEM BARBIES IS BAD IT GIIIIIRLS
Now, why did Nicki need a sidekick 🤔?
I got it. icey spicey Has to be Albino right
wallahi nicki has nothing on ice spice
Omg they both freaking SLAYED 💕💖
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😌😌😌😌
That song was beautiful until now, that they have spoiled it by denigrating men, Barbie has always instilled in us the value of mutual respect, which does not happen in this video since she never treated Ken badly SINCE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HIM, INSTEAD HERE THEY COME OUT LITTLE AND WORSHIPING HER SOMETHING NOT TO SEE WITH THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM🥺😢💔
Ur the best!!🎉🎉
Remote button
I wanted a BARBIE OPEN YOUR EARS
I never had a barbie ....I had to take care of a baby doll ....and I destroyed it 😅😇

Ice Spice voice reminds me of a female version of Pop Smoke. She’d be amazing on drill beats
Better than the Dua Lipa song.
Ice spice tryna collab with everyone for real
ok olipoppppp
It is supposed to be for girls or boys and they come out with bathing suits showing everything they are bad habits that children go to learn
Love it! ❤❤❤😊

Vamos por el millon de Likes ❤❤
I like it but it blows my mind how the entire 90’s is being redone!!! Im here for it tho
I wonder if kids r allow to watch this barbie movie   👇 Like if u think its going to be the best barbie movie 😊
Poderia ter deixado só a banda Aqua cantar.
I feel like the Playlist in the movie isn't really akin to barbie. It's a lot of new artist and barbie has always had at least a verity of lots of artist I feel like bringing in old songs plus maybe some new ones would have been the move. I'm just not loving the songs for the movie. Like I miss the old barbie movies princess and the pauper mawah
Calling on all Nicki fans to help Ariana Grande's "Into You" video reach 1 billion views
Video could have shown a little less of Minaj and the other chick, spice world or whatever, and more of those dancers!
Trash. The original Aqua song was the way. they're lucky Ryan gosling is in the movie.
THE ORIGINAL BARBIE!!! 🩷👛🌸
Nicki will be at odds with her by next year. You kno how she do
Ice Spice is terrible
Vamos por los 30M
THE BARBIE W THE BARBIE 💕💖✨❤️😘💕
This was cute ❤

Lettts gooo🎉
What is this ghetto barbie ?  Horrible pointless version song.. .this .ruined the original aqua version of barbie song.
I LOVE NICKI!!!!!
Talk about product placement. the funny thing is I literally had those drinks that they promoted in there. The oli pop. They're pretty good. I didn't realize it was the same drink camila cabello promoted till i re watched the commercial. Its kinda like a soda but not. It's really just carbonated water with prebiotics and no surger. I haven't had an actual soda since i graduated high school in 2015. I gave up on it. But i recently tired this drink and it was pretty good.
This song clearly should have 100m views ❤
99.99% of the views are males
Destruíram a música
This so epic song of my 90s songs, so amazing and Nicki Minaj has done it so amazingly and Aqua has done one amazing song ♥️♥️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😎😊
I love how simple and extra spice is
For some reason I felt like a Lil Nas x feature or a drake feature would've been an amazing addition to this

I love how da queen let ice play wit da song
配信お疲れさま(*´﹃｀*)
THIS IS TRASSSSH!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO RAP MUSIC 😫😫😫
I remember back in the 90’s on MTV, the hosts of this one show smashed the VCR tape of AQUA’S “BARBIE GIRL” so people can “never listen to that song ever again!”. I cried, cuz as a child back then, I loved Barbies and AQUA, still do. 😅 And if memory serves correct, AQUA got sued for the song? The case was dismissed though. 26 years later, WB+Mattel are using their song as part of the new movie. Admittedly, I am so happy about this and I’m loving this version of the song too. ❤
This song is EPIC in my book! 💗 The visuals are on point too frfr!!! 💪🏾💯 #barbieworld

Na verdade achei bem insano. Estão querendo mudar tudo!? Não estraguem minha infância😢  Nada contra a Nicki Minaj, mas isso não combina com a Barbie🥺  Obs: ela faz o clipe/música que ela quiser, mas não concordo com a Mattel metendo uma dessa no filme.
I'm 43 not friend not child
I'm just checking to  see why ho
Está horrible, al menos puedes enfocarte en la música de fondo para escuchar el clásico

It is so obvious that if you collab with BTS...for sure you'll get at least 100M views👀
HARRRRAAAAAAAAAMMMMMM !!!!!!!!!!
All the beats produced for this ice spice  are the same?
I like the song but the end is annoying. “It’s giving Beethoven”? Giving what? Vibes? You can’t give a person.
Rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas rainhas
This is straight trash, the beat and rap are a mismatch
I never imagined the day would come when I'd complain about someone speaking in rhyme over Aqua's "Barbie World." And yet, now it's here.
Stream this and princess diana for clear skin
This is a HIT!
well one thing, this video is hilarious XD
I’m a guy and booping to it. 👏
Everyone should totally stream SEVEN by Jungkook 🙇🏽‍♀️💜🫶🏼 love u spiceee
Me encantó esta canción es una de la mejores❤

Cool 😄
In Ice Spice's they didn't sensor the B-Word. It's dumb it has to be sensored... This song is fire though
Garbage👏
I like the fact that Ice Spice has her own vibe. And her voice and Nicki's are  just satisfying
It's been years but l'm never tired of listening to your songs .This is dope ✨
i can't stop watching this video and how incredible and beautiful Nicki looks😍
This song do be slaying ❤😂
The duo we didn’t know we needed!! Like they are such a good duo

Completely no good talent.

FIRE!!💕🥳⭐️
I’m going from the shade to being a fan of Nicki Minaj…….she the most PROLIFIC and TALENTED writer of the female rappers……period
They had to get Nicki to do something with this movie like she’s been the queen of Barbie for years
Been a nicki fan and her visuals have gotten sooooo much better over the years
La vida es una aventura: atrévete.  😙👍👍😄
Las dos 😍☺️
I propose to you on your channel
Nicki copped her a Ken in real life!!!!

This song weak but that’s just my opinion
Ice spice's voice👀, I'm not the only one that's hearing it right?🤔
Idk why do their voices work so well together
❤❤❤❤🔥
La canción es mala.
Nicki dies😭😭😭😭
The vibe tho!
Love ittttt💕
No me gusto esta version
Nicki has been rapping since 2007 and the queen of rap still never disappoints ❤
Aqua still getting them royalty checks from “Barbie Girl.” Nearly 30 years later.
Jesus Christ loves you all so very much!
No pasa nada

This songs flow is soo fire 🔥👌
Pls do more it was so good for the real Barbie movie! ❤❤❤

Fire song! but I guarantee Nicki will be beefing with her within 2 years.

Well, I like so much more the original song 🤷
Reina y princesa 💕👑
No puedo creer que la gente confunda el empoderamiento con la sexualización. Que definitivamente Barbie no representa 👎🏼
No matter what the narrative is, Nicki is very supportive of new female rap artists. Always there in their early breakouts, featuring and giving them more limelight.
❤
People like anything 😂
Original is always better than this garbage
Love the song, but we not gonna talk ab the olipop “ad”
La mejor canción de barbie ❤
It's giving makeover

The fact that nicki’s husband is named Ken
“Slayyy” Yesss 💅💅💅
Perfeito
Amo esa canción
It was a no brainer that nikki took part in the barbie movie
Nicki looked stunning  at the Barbie movie Premier
If you don’t sexualise your content then how will it sell, right? We live in a sad dumb world.
Did this pucchiach just ruin another 90’s song that I enjoyed as a 4 year old ? 😢😢
Why don't you shut up those two old ladies who talk a lot about that great song that it was?
I remember when I saw ur your love song tht was the day I'm getting addicted to your songs 🫡

Un total fracaso las canciones. Si hubiera Sido una colaboración Nicky Minaj ft Aqua. Hubiera sido brutal. Una nueva versión para la película.
Nicki Minaj ❤ I love your songs, Brazilian in the area 🇧🇷
Garbage

c'est vraiment guez
Would love all the dolls to b n it

What University they studying nikki please answer me
Why Ice spice in every song says the word claaa😩💅💅👁️👄👁️
I personally dont think nikki friends wit any of these up and coming artist she trying to get homage paid to herself in a round about way or trying to stay relavent. I mean seriously when the last time she had a 💯 original song not a sample
GG
Stop this is incredible 💗
Nicki u and ice spice look so beautiful
I love the song🫶🏽🥳💕✨…
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
boring sht, gimme aqua instead
Slayyyy
No entiendo cómo está canción con esa letra sale en la película 😢 hay tantas cosas innecesarias ahí 🤦🏻‍♀️
Genius idea. 🫡 to both of them

WHERE MY BARBS AT
En x2 es gracioso 😂
Didn't expect the crossover we needed
SLAYYYY
Please try OEC - Air Force One
It would be nice for people to put their own spin on things and make new songs instead of remaking. Other people's masterpieces make your own you both make good song yall could have came up with a new theme song everything on the radio played tf out Nobody down to make new music just want to remake.😢
💖
Nicki is finished
Two of the baddest 🔥
This song is cool. But not cool enough to replace the Aqua version

I can't believe nicki is 40 years old now
Nicky Minaj❤❤❤❤❤
Ima ten so i pull in a Ken
I can't believe people actually call this music 🤣
Ice spice looks so good oh my❤
Niki minaj ❤
Ice spice is terrible and having her in the same song as nikki makes it even more obvious. Same flow. So flat. Almost sounds like nikki is mocking her when she dies ice spice flow. I know shes not. But thats how bad it is
Ice spice’s voice is sooo calming even shes raping
It's varbie if you're in doubt
On repeat non stop, How 'bout dat 1hour version tho' ? ❤🎉
Nicki has been a huge barbie enthusiast and I’m so glad the movie film director reached out to her.
The best in the game 🔥🔥 no one can top that
Ngl as a girl ice spike is cute and hot in this vid
Esto es un insulto a la canción original
ايس سبايس اللي شالت الاغنية ولا ترى نيكي منتهية 😂🤣🤣
❤❤❤
Nicky acting like a doll in the video is everything, lol
Is perfect cover

They have destroyed the original Aqua Barbie Girl song and not at a good way
Playlist for today: 1. Barbie World  2. Anaconda (it needs views, or else Bodak Yellow will surpass it!) 3. Princess Diana  Enjoy streaming!
Can we stop giving Ice Spice attention? So undeserved.

Grah💗
Wow this song is so nice I love this Musik 🎉
2 Queens 🩷🩷🩷." I'm a 10, so I'm pulling a Ken"
Ice spice killed it if this was a competition
This song is way too short, I want more.
Using this instead of the original by Aqua for the movie is a crime.
Idgaf what ANYONE says..they did this 🤣🤣🤪❤️
i think the editing is better than the song
Wow, this is..... terrible
it’s girl but they anti playing tags we knew that cause they both ate and out sold cardi b like ice spice out sold her too
Y'all should make an album 2gether
outsold cardi b so bad that she went into hiding
our rap queen Nicki rock it ❤❤❤❤
The slaaayyyy at the end got me💀
Ice Spice always looks completely disinterested in everything that’s happening around her.
why do ice spice always have the same flow in her every rap but with a different beat
Can't get better than a Trini barbie.
Unghetto mathew plastic
1:42 - I love Nicki thighs 😍
Omg
what a very narcissist song 😆😆😆😆
Amazing beat 🎉🎉🎉❤❤

Slayyy in fire 💅💅🔥🔥
Absolutely DESTROYED a generation’s jam within minutes.. complete trash-take it out with the dream house
Can we talk about the thumbnail tho?
Baddest bloodcloth song now
Wait this song just two mins they could have when 230 3min.

Very surprised this song is in the Barbie movie

The  flow is nice .
😍😍😍😍
When you want a hit! You know who to call!
Pls leave the kids alone. Nicki u should know better
Tik tok made this famous 💅💅
I'm sorry but the raps didn't do any justice to the original song. It ruined for me. Them rapping separately without adding the original song would have been better. 🥲🥲🥲
Barbies aint chubby chicks
nicki
0:11
nueva canción fav
I love this song
Let’s be honest, Nicki as Queen of Rap and Ice Spice as Princess of Rap
with all due respect: why dont they use the original song? or why not doing some completely different? they totally ruined the song for me.
I love it soooooooooooooooo goodddddddddddddd
With aqua?
This is like the best of the best song of the year
I loved that for the official song of this movie they thought of nicki minaj since she deserves to be the interpreter of the song since she is the best musical icon representing barbie
So cute
life in plastic is so fantastic
Hbd 🥳 your number for you are in your 🥰😍🥳🎉🥰
Awful
🔥🔥🔥🔥
AQUA
😂
Para eso mejor lo hubieran dejado así jajaja no se acerca para nada al éxito original
Loves it ❤
Awful, awful, AWFUL!!!
Nicki looks like Doja did in the Like That video
💯💯💯💯🍬🔥🔥
This was honestly cute❤
I love Nicki, and I admit I didn't know Ice Spice. But this song... they couldn't just have the original barbie girl song, and also this rap? I don't like them together T_T
I love this video with all my heart

Come on Mattel we need some Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice dolls NEOW
What did spice mumble?
As this is what all the young girls need to listen to these days 😂, although then again everyone's turned into ❄️'s these days maybe it'll fix things 🤣, but with how things are these days I'm surprised this isn't getting backlash especially when it's meant to be in the new movie that young young kids will watch

So like it's only fitting while being living 🎉 PROOF IF YOU SAID YOUR vision was ***** by u SPEAKING it you CAN ACHIEVE IT. SHE BEEN SAYING SHE WAS BARBIE SINCE 05 :-) But at what cost. Now the materialism and self absorbtion will skyrocket
❤❤❤❤
Heyyy

In a world of pink, where power resides, Nicki's voice soars, breaking stereotypes' tides.
Why do ice spice look lile a science project...😅
If YouTube don’t stop freezing the views
Nicki Minaj é definitivamente a porra da rainha da porra do rap.

For Ever Nicki Stan .. No cardi ICE Spice and etc.. ❤
The best thing about this is how nicki acts like a Barbie doll for the aesthetic 🤭
Song is too short
Wife mother mogul what can't she do #slay
Nicki's lines are fine as are Ice's but this beat just ain't it. Am I high or does it sound muddled, monotone and flubby. Like something went wrong In the studio, the producer needs to go over the Track it's actually wack, like the beat shouldn't be that distracting.
Love how Nicky had her legs in the beginning just like barbie 😂
Ice spice is like boring yk
YouTube is always messing with nicki views. How is it stuck on 25m for days??

"Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither--whatever they do prospers."

Nicky parece más una Bratz
The queens must calAB

Ice Spice got a certain flow idc what people say she different her flow is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 her a nicki are a perfect duo
This should be the song for the new Barbie movie !

The fact that the first time I heard this was today when driving back from camping 🤣
This is in the same category as Doja's Vegas song for the elvis movie ❣️😍 👏
They couldn't use a different olipop flavor 😭😭
Oppenheimer vs barbie  Men vs kid
Preciosa
Te amo
hi
why no twerk
Amo a Nicki pero no me gusto en lo absoluto la canción 😢
Only issue with this is Ice Spice has NO flow.
I love barbie so much Nicki and ice spice! I had those for years and I loved it! If people say you still play with barbies, you say, we barbie baddies we know we a 10! Period boo.
Ngl wish the vibe and beat was more early nicki when she really sported the "barbie" image. It just doesn't blend well with the movies vibe
AAAAAAA HABLA RAINHAS
PINK BAR-BEE DREAM HOUSE
Great remix
😭😭😭
nicki and ice spice are literally the power duo.
I like it 💕💕💕💕😘
I'm wondering how they got so much barbie pink.
Nicki Minaj is't barbie Queen ❤
I hope this song is also on the Pink Friday 2 album
The little barbs helping at the begging ❤️

This is trash omfg
Relembrando Aqua Barbie Girl
That's a lot of product placement and mid lyrics
Nicki always the queen of rap, Always with a flow, incredible quality, that's why she's the queen.
the ‘slayyyyyy’ at the end from those kids is so ironic ❤
Pink Barbie
HE WANNA PLAY IN THE PLAYHOUSE
Idk who i want more 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
❤❤❤❤
I love the fifty fifty song 👍 more good for Barbie themes
Nicki Minaj and ice spikes make a good duo singers
Take a shot everytime you see a bot in the comments lol
so good❤
BARBZ YALL GOT LIFE SO FKKED UP IF YALL DONT WAKE TF UP N STREAM THIS MF SONG 🅱️arbie IS HERE BTC ‼️

Every single positive comment is a bot point black period
They took Barbie to a whole different level ❤🔥

they could redo this music video lol but I lOVEE this osng
Nicki carried this
This video makes no sense
I don’t like this…         I love it ❤
I feel like this is something Doja Cat should have been in...
ICONIC
I love the deeper tone of Ice Spice’s voice. ❤
I really like the background. Looks unique 👍
Song really is bad especially especially ice spice part nicki couldn’t save this one
stream barbie world and princess diana ✨
SLAY QUEENS
Anyone from TikTok??
I like how Mattel said this was okay but in the 90s the other song was bad because it would ruin the reputation, lol they literally drop an f bomb in this
trash
Y'all i just came here to twerk on thar part before the chorus. Highly recommend ❤
Aburrido el vídeo, no mostró nada de carne Nicki.
the plastic theme
This ain't it...

That ending was amazing
Kids gon be watching this when it's cussing and I oop
Im so excited for the movie 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Is it me or does ice spice have a mild case of down syndrome lol

The Olipop product placement took me out 😂

Love the classic better
what slop the original sounds 1000 times better, nobody wants to see anabell and her friend rapping, the only flaw in the movie is not including this original epic hymn from barbie in the 90s

The queen of rap and the princess of rap Slayed once again
Acts gangsta but is scared of cardi b though 😂
Ice spice can't change her flow of rap... Y'all notice it
This is awful, and why is Nickie still in the spotlight with all her pro-peadophilia and pro-predator stances. Just sad
25 Million Views is Epic. Let’s have more BARBZ
They had to have the barbs with ice spice bars for Barbie girl. I'm so happy this collab happened it was needed. I missed me some Nikki
The mv is sooooo fire🩷💖

This song gives me the 90's vibes and its stuck in my head ❤❤❤❤
Hi BARbie ... hi BaRbie ...
This beat goes hard
It's moving rather slowly here, Barbz where tf y'all at?
dang way to sample the same beat as you did with She In Ha Mood.....
this is so perfect!💕
All Barbie dolls are amazing  Barbie bitchs

Absolute garbage
Is that even a talent 😂 bleh bleh bleh bleh . And yet they make tons of money .
You love ice spice

Nicki is perfection ❤
Wow she is in another world 🌎
very nice
I don't understand what Ice Spice is Saying 🤔
b.ıııııı. ch xdb.ıııııı. ch xd
Nicki is Queen no debate she carries every time.
I’m so glad Nicki never stops she is too gifted for the benchwarmers 🔥
Nicki Minaj taking Ice Spice as her protégée is the best thing ever. Get it girls !
Y’all acting like this song gone be in the movie it’s cute tho 😂😂😂
Aqua royalties 🎉
Naaah bro, ya'll better listen to "Party Girls" by Ludacris, its waaay dopest interpretation of barbie song chorus.
Love it

So sad this movie has to come out for this music video. 🫠🤕🤤🥶 lol but whatever 😍

ON REPEAT TIL IM IN SIDE THE CINEMA WATCHING THE MOVIE
Before actually clicking on the video, I was wondering if they'd make a reference to AQUA's Barbie Girl. Indeed they do 😂
This in tiktok?  Didnt encounter it yet on fyp

Giant praise by humans
Barbie queen of the queen👑🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ICE SPICEEE
How much is this video looks expensive 😮
Me like I'm waiting for any of em who'll sing I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world. But na happened.
I wish they would have let the barbie song play more after the Song
You guys are so cool
Pink 💞💞💞💞💞💞
the duo we didnt know we needed
why have i not heard this!? 😭 nicki is really one of the best rappers ever. Ice is such a complementary artist for her.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow
The new upcoming Barbie movie should’ve just been them. The true Barbies💅
what what is happening
Divulgação do filme barbie pesadíssimaaaa, amei hehhe
If i got a dollar for everytime Ice says "grah" i'd have enough money to buy nicki minaj.
This is absolutely 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trrassh....u can never come close to the 90s..... better go smoke sum knack or something.... lol
Wait nicki with pink wolf cut? This is her ERA
I’m not gone lie, I really be wanting to give these new girls a chance but every single one sounds monotone asf w/no real talent or bars, Nicki could have ate this track up on her own🥴. These new girls lack the ability to be diverse in their rapping, whereas Nicki has endless flows, Ice only as one sound & EVERY bar sounds EXACTLY like the last. All new female rappers are generic sounding
SLAYYYEDDD
Bith did a good job but ice spice know how to bounce on a beat!
Dope 📸📸
I’m sorry that song was trash and could you understand Ice Spice, no me neither (so overrated there are so many other up coming female MC who are eaten lyrically like Omeretta) but it was written about a white plastic doll 😅 so go phucking figure 🤣🤷🏾🫠
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’ve been listening to this all day

Honestly, it makes me sad to say this... But Ice voice sounds like St. Jhn..."pop smoke"... Ice sounds like female St.Jhn...❤

Here from a news mention this existed .  Sad that it's a mumble rap by that plastic cutout that was splattered on top of all VEVO owned music videos years ago .
Ice spice has so much potential .........Like not everyone can be w/ nicki whose been around for 15 yrs. Duh

Nicki Minaj has never looked like a Barbie.. Ill never know why she decided to run with this 😂
I'm i the only one that's had this song on repeat?
I still remember Nicki's first raps, this woman knew she had talent, that her rap was powerful. It was her self-confidence that made it all possible. Now she's the Queen of Rap ♥💯
Not being rude not hate aren’t you old Anough to be singing barbie but this song is so food

Im sorry but. Ice spice doesn't fit in.
Avete dovuto rovinare una canzone storica
I’m just so psyched that this has come full circle. Nicki the og Barbie now making music for the Barbie movie. To a sample of a song that got sued by Mattel. Lol
Форма вообще классная 🤩
She,s the Grammys herself
Queen
Yessssss 🎉
Lamest song in history
Should have said Isis, Stacy Nicki....cause our girl Ice spice is a barbie too 💓💅💋
Not a fan I’m sorry. How many songs will she take from another artist just cause people already know it and it’s catchy?! Sorry but I like people who make original songs. No hate towards Nicki or Ice but this song just ain’t it for me.
Baaaaaasic. She ain't sweating.
Is this in the movie? 💀
Hood certified 💯
This sucks so bad I absolutely have no words to utilize for criticism.🤮
Nicki and ice price are the best rappers
if they have no problem letting nicki minaj sample barbie girl, why not just buy a licence and use the whole original song?
🍎🍎
ice spice KILLEDT it
I needed this 😩👌❤
Who i stacy and diamond?
welp! It’s Barbie b***h 🫶🏾💕💗
25M soon my queens❤
The treatment was amazing per usual 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Am I the only one who feels this is not enough. The song is too short ❤. The song is perfect

Talvez a galera não esteja se ligando no quão daora e foda foi  acontecer esse clipe. A Nick e a Ice matando esse drill, beat que é usado por uma galera bem machista do trap, pesadissimo em cima de "barbie girl", pra campanha do filme da Barbie. hahaha isso é histórico na moral
Someone said ice spice looks like someone with Down syndrome and I can’t unsee it I try but I just can’t wahh😢

Nicki has been in the rap game for 15 years and still never disappoints 💯
I'm a mild fan of Nicki and she looks fine as _____ here in this video.  But .....I will be the rare dissenter here.....this song sucks!!!

What are people talking about in the comments, this is straight up bad.
The people who came from tick-tock can like this
when i heard the snippet i really thought this song was trash, but now that I've listened to the entire thing I realize it's actually garbage.
Trending song❤
Ice spice looks like she got down syndrome
Barbie Dreams by fifty fifty is so much better 😭😭😭 what even is this
#7 on billboard 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Seems like copyright infringement to me.
Hits different every time
smallest budget in hollywood apparently
I love this song ❤❤❤❤
little Kim can’t say Nicky has never payed homage to her because ❤she’s still doing it it to this very day….
When did barbie start to spund like 6ft 3 mike
Crazu barbie land has turned into satans mouth
Is this going to be in the Barbi movie?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞💗💕
апочему девушка похожа на Дору

Wow so creative!  Just recycling trash from the 90’s
This is rubbish

1: 54  all kids say SLAY!!! who living like skinny barbie 👁👄👁💅
https://youtube.com/@carenboyomo1287
Besides duo Nicki and Ariana, This is the second best duo for me, Nicki and Ice 🥰🥰 what a cool song
i always thought it was so funny she called herself Barbie and now she's married to a Ken and he also made her Mrs. Petty 😂
this song is a bop❤
Why are people wasting their time hating on them?
Geillllloo💋
How is this better than princess diana…
RAD
prostitutes have to ruin everything.
😍
Straight up GARBAGE
That was very bizarre but go off I guess
Sounds exactly like Princess Diana
Trash
🤡🤡🤡
so fire!!!!
Nicki Minaj👙💖 and Ice Spice🧊🌶️ is best duo
Honestly Nicki is my Barbie🩷
the poor kids who are going to look up to this, how was this allowed😢
Nah, respectfully, this ain't it. Princess Diana was actually a bop
Still awful
Go barbzzz !!! 24 mil viewss to goo 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻

Yo queria la de los 00s 😢😅
the worst song i ever heard
I'm a doll but I still wanna party
Looove!!!!!❤❤❤
The infinite joy of fast spoken third grade rhymes over a 4-4 back-beat and washed out bass. I know 12 year olds with more musical talent than the entire Rap World.
you ate, thanks.
Nicki wanna be like cardi so bad she doing drill music and before you say cardi juat start go and look up cardi first couple songs
I expected better, feels like it was made last minute on a weekend.

Thank you ice and Nicki for killing music.
When someone gets so bored they will find my comment well I will wait
I bet not see none of you Barbies in Jordans
Wow this sucks
Ewww, what it is sh!t ??!!!!
Who are these plangent trulls that so glibly do don such excoriating haberdashery whilst plaintively ululating?
24M is coming...
This is a barbie music simply because they put the aqua audio in the background otherwise it would not be a barbie music 🤣🤣🤣
Terrible

Came looking for doja's new song and the I SEE THIS?? YEAHH

Yassss mamiiiii
I love nikki been my favorite for years but ice on the other hand got no bars,😭
It's always Nicki for me
Her every video is like e po$n  video🤣
🥰🔥🔥
NOT THE SLAYYYY AT THE END 😂
proud of you Nicki that you’re still rocking and queen in the industry
Not Nicki and ice making me wanna throw gang sign on a barbie song 💀
real barbie
Should've left Aqua' song as it is in the movie
Whoaaaaa this shiddddd FIYYEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Idk why do their voices work so well together
Omg. Why?? I loved aqua growing up as a 90s kid.
Nope.. why ruin a classic.. now tik tok is going to ruin more😢
Seriously, this is considered a song? The downfall of music industry
Heard bad things about this, tbf not bad. Average
ICE SPICE ATE THIS
Two goddesses of drill without a doubt.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Original better

🔥🔥🔥🔥
nicki is finally looking black again. the melanyn is popping 😍
This video is crazy😨
Everything comes full circle.
❤❤❤
these features are not a good look for the new artists she's bribing/using for marketing_at all her performances are so stale now_the beats are blahzay & whatever_she used to be good_now stale but she still needs popularity_so she pays next level artists to feature_to pay her way into popularity better off paying a pop or ice to ghostwrite something relevant just for her to karaoke & call it hers her original style without safaree ghostwriting is irrelevant & boring this barbie theme she's been stuck on since parting w/ safaree is generic
listen_nicki keeps paying next level artists to feature_to keep her name out there_but she been done since safaree stopped writing her raps_no one's buying this barbie persona she paid pop & 69 & ice_i respect her as one of the best out of new york_and they took the bag_but i gotta think they could get that bag anyway_& still not take the bribe from low talent now at one point nicki was fire_she was a combo of wayne x gaga x kim/foxy_at the right time_plus safaree giving her clever things to say_but without those factors_what is she?_what is this? ok say you grew up on her so her name is familiar & you keep clicking for that_beyonce of destiny child had that_but still surrounded herself w/ next songwriters for relevant art_nicki lost the art
Slayy 😂

Can we just appreciate how much work is put into this.

Omg I hope they have those dolls slay
amooooo
Love you barbie Nicki Minaj 🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇷🇴
Nicki is becoming more popular than Cardi again.🤷
Love
❤❤❤❤
Aqua's song will always be the base for Barbie songs
I always thought Barbie dolls and stuff are supposed to be for kids but this video and lyrics prove otherwise 😅😅
I wasn't really feeling ice spice. Her songs are really catchy but lyrically all the same and her live performances could use work.  But she really brought it with Niki. Hopefully she gave her some advice and she takes it.
2023 be like...
BilliNika
They make a good team
Grandiose baby
not that good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕
Peggy up with that tag stuff
ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeee🤓🤓🤓🤓😎😎
I'm always rooting for Nicki, the Rap Queen 👑

Sorry this is no barbie girl song!  Just because the chorus says I am a barbie  girl original song  is better and it should have been in the movie, not this piece of junk song!
Nikki Minaj is 🗑️
They are both so awkward and alienish.
She just trashed a good bubblegum song.
Album collaboration
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else is getting good ol nicki vibes❤
Please  make more. Songs

The amount of years of Nikki being relavent is older than me. And I am turning 100 and a 2 this year💀🗿💅

''He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.   (Psalm 145:19) ''But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.   (1 Thessalonians 5:8) ''But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.   (Ephesians 2:13) ''Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)

So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. (1 Corinthians 15:42-58)
i hope this is in the movie

Baby Olipop is not playing with the marketing
The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We all must be willing to turn from sin and believe and follow Jesus for forgiveness. 1st John 2:17 He who does the will of God abides for eternity. That’s letting Jesus live His life in and through us His children, by knowing and obeying the Word of God !!! ❤️📖nkjv🙏🧎🏻‍♂️🕊🇺🇸🕊

What a combo
Ice Spice killing Nicki with the long hair in the background.
SLAAAAYYYYY
U came to heaven
It’s my first time hearing & seeing this and the english caption is not doing its job, so I don’t understand most of the lyrics to be honest. Google search then!
I wonder how many young people watching this know about the original Barbie song from almost 30 years ago from Aqua.
Love it
Does the Queen respond?
cultural reset
The olipop soda cans tho
Niki mi naaj naag nool ayaa tahay 2011 ku partay hawen dheexaa waan kugu riyootay
Hit #7 on BB 100!! 🔥🔥🎀🎀🎀🎀
sounds messy like her other songs that doesn’t make it on the charts. Wonder why she’s always mad at other Female rappers for making up there at #1😬. #QueenOfFlop👎🏽
ITS PERFECTION DOWN TO THE SPONSORSHIPPOPP OLIPOP??? SO CUTEKEKSKDJSKWE
Well, this got ruined.  What happen to Nicki

Really don’t get why people even like Ice Spice, she lacks talent to be an artist and she ain’t even attractive like everyone claims. Spice girls should be suing for the name spice being used anyways. Sad that is what we call music.
“I keep dragging her and she bald a bit” got it 😭😭😂 okayyy Iceee spice ❤❤
cant even hate ice spice eating
This song is too short
This sounds horrible..
QUE PAMPARA!🔥🥵    💗💗
They are a dream team wow

I love it when Nicki Minaj has pink in her video's.. it takes me back to Super base 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
This song isn't it. I know the Barbz had hopes, but this is too childish to bop in public. They look beautiful though.
20M YASSS🦄🌼🌺
I love how Ice Spice is out here having that deep voice . Touches my heart ngl (not the biggest fan of her music tho).

I cant say how happy i'm that Ice Spice is winning  none stop !
The Collab we never knew but needed
It would be ok If they didn't want to add the original song to the soundtrack. But why making this horrible version?
Muy bien mi hielo picante 💋💅🏻
Whoa. I am really late...I _just_ put together that Nicki's husband is _Ken!_ 😲 It's astounding how much she truly manifested her entire life. 💯

So funny & missing Aqua band ‘90s
Awesome
THE original version that was mocked all the time, was so much better music wise. Now we have Nicki and Ice decided to talk over it with marginal effort to change it. Did any1 noticed that "good afternoon" is a bit old fashioned?
19MIL VIEWS TO GO !!!!
FUNK RAVE
Funk rave
“People who didn’t come from TikTok are allowed to like this” TikTok is a MUSIC app. It used to be called MUSICALLY for a reason. it’s not even like these are underground artists 💀TikTok MADE ice spice and paved her a CAREER. It literally discovered her and YouTube/all the late apps to trend figured out about her NOW.
QUEEN OF RAP

Hi Barbie
The queen is back again ❣️🇲🇦
These song is so trash and horrible like all Nicki song and features
I don’t like the song but I do like the video it’s just y’all just did a pink video. Should of did a different Barbie theme.
we making it out of malibu with this one
interesting
Man this is horrible
ATE
y’all hating, but listening and commenting, you giving them money and clout🤭💀
Barbieee
I gave it a listen, pure trash and y’all who like this have zero taste
I don't care about nothing!!! Barbie!! 😍💗 Nicki Minaj! 💖🦄🔥 It just makes sense and I love it!!! Love this!!!
I need an extended version
Horrible song
Why is this so good
BARBIE GHETTO! PERIODT💅🏼🦋💖
I wonder if Ice Spice will continue to have the same hype and success in two years. Right now the world is just eating her up and co-signing her but if I’m 100% her flow isn’t anything TOO unique and I can see how it could potentially get stale. I wonder what she is going to do to keep up momentum.

Every single ice spice song sounds the EXACT same. She's such an obvious industry plant.
The Barbie music in the background ruined it for me.
It's Barbie B**** <3
THE ORIGINAL IS THE BEST, THEY SHOUD JUST KEPT IT THAT WAY💯
Y’all they are starting to delete views

This reminds me of her older music videos from like 2015

This song should've been more child friendly since its barbie
SLAAAAY IM A FAN SINCE 2009😝😝💅💅💅❤
Dis sounds like a drill beat mixed with hip hop 😂
I came from a youtube ad
I love Ice spice voice
18 m period
sick high budget cgi, what was the budget??
I mean this in no offense, but I think this song is a bit too far and too difficult to understand. I mean the repetitive of lines alone are enough for a headache. I know it comes from every song, but it has meaning to them being repetitive in the chorus line.
I told y'all! Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj for life!! They can never be beaten!!
❤🎉😮😊
I feel if Nicki had this song on her own it would be completely different she is the original Harajucka Barbie im ngl Nicki shudda done this sample in 2012
its so catchy and cute. Especially the lyrics "I am a 10 so I am pull in a ken"

QUEENS🔥
Nicki had fun with this. I love when she just enjoy her craft and have fun wit it
QUEEEEN
Nicki and Ice are definitely sister in arms
Why is this so short? This ain't a song, it's a jingle. I'm so tired of everyone making songs for TikTok. Whatever happened to 3 and half minute songs with two verses, three choruses, a bridge AND an instrumental breakdown for dance breaks at the club? C'mon now.
My fave song
the amount of effort that nicki put into this one: couldn't be bothered.
Nope
I swear, my fav part is the end part!😅
I tried to play Grateful Dead on the guitar does this sound good? https://youtu.be/DmeplJQoZ4s
She said IT girls and we AIN’T playing tag. 😭 bruh Nicki been that tho. Nun new 💯 I fw it, and Ice Spice is growing on me. She just needed to find her wave 🌊 she ridin it clean now tho. 👏🏽 That’s was up, Nicki stays showing the youngsters love too.
You just KNOW this is gonna be in that new Barbie movie🤣🤣🤣
they want me
I LOVE THIS !!!!!

Why was the audio separated between rella gzz and ice spice same voice different underthetable actors
Bob Barker plus Barbie all them jobs got me exhausted taking a chill in a cell only fake is inside me pretending to who to be life is my pure creation obey my voice
best duo frfr
❤❤❤
Charli xcx speed drive way better
That is hot garbage. That hype is absolutely undeserved.
I need to know what lip combo Nicki used
It's so cute, and also very ironic that Nicki Minaj's husband's name is Ken, and she's always been THE Barbie… Isn't that crazy coincidental?
Ngl this is Fire
What a night mare this 'song' is
I love you Nicki🎉❤
Fr the fact that Ice Spice has Downs makes her 100% hotter
Nickiiiii ❤️
Ruined the original song 🙄👎👎
Everyone that says the song is boring watched this video 20 times on YouTube, listened to it more that 30 times on spotify, and have been singing the lyrics internally these past few days !

Every time Nicki is in a song with a sample i know it's absolutely ruined so there's no point in having hope. The two worst female rappers to ever live on the same track? Sounds like a win to me.
So this the song my kids are Gonna be listening to in the movie ? If so I’ll pass

Ice looks amazing and nicki in that pink crochet mullet, is fire!! She gave me demi lovato image vibes though for a tenth of a second
I love that Nicki married a “Ken” and she can truly reference Ken as hers as the Barbie 🦄‼️
Naaahh it ain't it

Hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing  Jean 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me  Act 4:12   Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  jesus is the only way *not buddha *not Muslims * not spiritual *and even less your Sunday evening yoga that will save you  John 8:58 Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am   Exodus 3:14  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you🔔

This is degeneracy.
If anyone should sing a Barbie song it’s nicki.
Of all things considered, this remix deserves to be in the Barbie movie more: https://youtu.be/XqBeHOc3K9o
ngl ice verse was harder🤷🏽‍♂️
This is the same Nicki that has a feat on my Ni**a?
♥️🔥🔥
Queen
BILLBOARD CHANGED THE RULES AGAIN. NICKI NEEDS TO PLAY CHESS WITH THE CORPORATIONS AND LABEL HEADS because this doesn’t happen to DRAKE, ARIANA, OR TAYLOR SWIFT. I will be streaming this song in my sleep, when I brush my teeth, anything because whoever this is, wants Nicki’s mic cut off.
Slaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

This is making me realize that Ice Spice only has like one type of beat she raps to. This is the same beat as "She in ha mood" or however it's spelled but with the "Barbie Girl" sample.

SlaYyyyyyyyy lol😂😂
NICKI X ICE FIRE
When nicki Minaj is edited to look like a giant, it looks like they copied the background of the new Barbie movie that is about to come out. Because I’m the trailer of the movie it shows Barbie “Margot Robbie” as a taller person than the little girls and has about the same background. Like if you agree, if you don’t it’s your choice. 😊
❤❤🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤
USE ME AS DISLIKE
🥰💕💗
They should drop a mixtape together
Where there's C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N? Don't see any. No match for you Queen Nicki
In real life you didn't pull a ken
Pure garbage. Way to ruin an iconic song.
reminds me of the beat in ha mood
we love you nicki minaj you and ice spice did good
Nikki is awesome! ..Ice Spice? Nah.  Aqua probably would have hated this mix lol

What the f is this s***? The original definitely
RIP Pop Smoke!

Beyonce is better..
This video was fireeee! It made me laugh at the end with the “slayyy” from the little girls
They look more like Bratz actually
I like ice spice voice

Lo mismo dije de karolg asi que pregunta mejor yo sali a la fama el dia del parto y como tenia fama comenze a cantar mucha mas fama pa mi.

Thank You Nikki... Don't Care bout...✌️

Riot lowkey becoming goated
Aqua singing "I'm a barbie girl" in the background is distracting from the actual "song". Awful as usual but the producer should be sacked

“I’m a 10 so I pulling the Ken” is the best bar in the music industry. Barbies’s boyfriend is ken and Nickis husband is ken too 🥱❤️

Pink plane Nicki        up
👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
I’m a little confused what does nicki rap about because she just for the looks I see her raps are never a story line I guess just from the old school era of rap when. Rappers made sense
MOTHERQUAKE📈📈📈📈
I don't really like Ice Spice's other songs, but she sounds a lot more clearer on this track. And as a non-hiphop fan, this track is so good ❤❤
just two fine girlies
they both have the fake body parts down thats for sure lol

I Love Nicky
Yuck, they f up the song. Disgusting
THIS IS FIREEE🔥🔥
ew
back for the 10th time 🙊🤭🤭 video too short 😅
Ice Spice is so ratchet. She looks like she she's wearing Iggy Azalea's face as a mask (no offense to Iggy--it's impossible to make a human skin face mask look good).
The original song was trash. Good to see nothing has changed, if not gotten worse.
"it girls and we ain't playin' tag"
Love 🎉

slay barbz!

Nicki my barbie

Nicki and Ice Devouredddd 😩😍😍
Rad, but he spank me when I get bad 🫣🤭
Is Barbie still a toy for innocent little girls?
Nicki has been going for 15+ years and still delivering flows and wordplay. So much respect for the Queen of Rap
Perfeito ❤️
Nicki and ice spice work so well together
Big barbie
How is Ice Spice so boring ???

It girls and we ain’t playing tag period !

This song is lame af 😂
I'll be honest, I didn't like this new version at all, it seems like a reggaeton style, a lot of sensuality and some weak lyrics
Oh my god slay queens 💋💅💅💅💅
Nicki never misses, and I love how her and Ice flow together..😍😍 but Nicki definitely deserved to be in the movie. They could have made her an exclusive barbie..ijs

THIS BOMB
Soy el único al que no le gustó para nada esta versión? Puro bla bla bla ( rap) y nada de ritmo, nada que ver, ni el más mínimo guiño o referencia a la versión electro- dance de aqua...
Bruh it was Nikki that was the queen of rap but now ice spice if it wasn't for them music would be banned😢
Hiii I love your videos
❤❤❤❤❤
Ice spice not lucky she's blessed 🙏
It's the best video Nicki has done is a long time. The song is like a minute and change though wish it were longer 😅.
Could you imagine having to sleep with one of those women that have been threw as many men as a pornstar? Shes got bars but all I see is nasty as far as her body goes
Love Nickiiiii
I wanna like these Ice & Nicki songs so bad but I can’t 😭
Slaaay💗
Wow #pinklicious

Even the speed of the two songs don't fit....it is horrible.
Giving The boys ft Cassie vibes especially the fast beat
This does not fit musically. Cacophonic
Too slow motion

Wow this song very nice.such a beautiful place.all tha best more vedio impair.thanks for providing these nice vedio
Straight inferior to the original in every way. This is the most soulless cash-in I've ever seen like this. Some executive said, "these two are hot right now, throw them in there with some generic lyrics, don't worry about reworking the original, just throw it around in the background." Disgraceful.
🔥🔥🔥
Oh they’re taking it
❤
I am bad like the barbieeee 🫶🏽🫶🏽
imagine showing this video to a young victorian child
Nasty house ones
Ya know I still can't get over the fact our Barbie literally found happy ever after with her Ken irl😢

Yo estoy esperando los remix de cupkake
Omg slayyyy 💅🏻💅🏻😍😍1:56
I thought that this was going to just be like a ‘gimmick’ song for the movie or something I’d look past but I actually like this song a lot. Nicki’s “Ima ten so I’m pulling the Ken” has actually not left my head since I first heard it and Ice’s “im dragging her so she bald a bit”  is also doing a lot of the heavy lifting for me. They actually did so well on this!

Unpopular opinion, I'm not digging the song as much as I thought I would. I'm just singing the beat which is the original song turned into a sick beat.
Ate it nicki
Ok nicki😍😍💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼
Hiphip is officially the new pop music.... I can't believe what I'm seeing and hearing. Bring back the old genres of music please.
ice seems to be getting more confident in her voice and im here for it
OK
This is so cute 😂😂
My sister told me I like this song cause it’s nicki... tuh sure is 🤌🏾

What even MORE crazy is after 16 years in the spotlight- is that her flows are STILL innovative, creative, & unmatched! 😳 STILL! Now that just pure musical genius!  Nicki Minaj is officially the Michael Jackson of Rap!!!

This is a pop cultural milestone wth
Love you queen❤️❤️❤️
Never thought Nicki at 39 years old would still be makin nonsense barbie videos.  We live in immature times for sure.  No wonder music been dead since the digital age. Lol

ICE spice ❤❤❤ una muñeca bella  🇩🇴
I love Nicki but let’s talk bout the subliminal message behind this.. they literally showing how corporate giants want control the black woman nd clone us to fit in their image. Nd how the feminine energy in the industry isn’t the artist own agenda…
This was a cute little 2 minutes. 🩷
You did it again TT
OMGGG 💗💗💗
Compared to the original, this is honestly not bad at all! Nicki still got it, and Ice Spice honestly stole my heart in this video 😭🥲 can’t wait for the movie now!

This is horrendous
Best one
I swear if they don’t play this in the live action Barbie I’m gonna do some serious damage. 😊
The original song is 1000 times better!!!!
The one thing I've got to say about this song is it's way too short they should've made another verse or two easily either way though this song is catchy af and it's a very very Nicky type song 100%
This is the song of the yr nicki and Ice spice make such a good combo
DEFINITELY a Barbie summer
Ice is always 💪n Nick the queen 👸
lujuria be like:
Ima Doll But I still Wnna PARTY!!!!
Yikes…this is so bad
Solo escucho a AQUA 🎶🎶
Eu teria usado a original
Quedo genial .

So iconic that her car drives it self 😂

Suena mejor la version original   The original song from AQUA is better
This video is sinful and against God, but God is loving and long-suffering. Jesus Christ loves you, and He died for your sins on the cross, was buried and rose again the third day.  All humans are sinners, and we are eternally punished for that sin when we die. The good news of the Gospel is that our Lord Jesus Christ took the punishment for you on the cross, so you can be in Heaven for eternity instead.  All you have to do is accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour, and mean it from the heart, and you will be saved.  God bless you 🙏  Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” John 3:3 ESV  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 ESV  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. John 3:18 ESV  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3‭-‬4 ESV

If Nicki Minaj wasn't part of the Barbie The movie, official soundtrack like I wouldn't be happy about it. Cause she's a barbie.

Ice Spice deserves this collab with the Queen. I love it.
Ce que je montre à mes enfants c’est ça ? Barbie de cette manière ? mais là barbie je trouve ça choquant , tu te rend pas compte que tu passe partout on peut difficilement t’éviter ,grâce à ton merveilleux succes d’ailleurs .. que j’écoute depuis l’adolescence ! Mais je me pose réellement la question de la place de la femme car j’en suis une aussi … t’arrive t’il de te regarder dans ton métier et tu te dis quoi ? . 🇫🇷 malheureusement l’homme nous vois peut être pas comme toi tu le pense nicki . 🩷

Ridiculous ….. barbie is not like this ! I love nicki. Wake up..Please 😔. being rich does not give all the rights, it is shocking unfortunately their success does not allow them to understand that they are also devastating Like a weapon!😒 ..
I’m soooooo happy for ice spice !! She’s been around for like 5 minutes but absolutely killing it ❤️ yes girl
Meh boring
This song implodes worse than a Titan submarine.
NICKI ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS! PERIODTTTT!!

https://youtu.be/NrfjVZvf1JE
LOOOOOOOOVE THIS
How much did Barbie pay u to make this song with Nikki was she begging u to do it with her to
Nicki 🤭 OH MY GOSHHH
There are NO BLACK BARBIES & KENTS. Nicki Minaj Should Stick to her Own ethnicity; and Should Start being an ORIGINAL; but She makes too Much MONEY and Gets too much ATTENTION being a WHITE WANNABE CLOWN.
Nicki Minaj made a Career out of her WHITE GIRLS CLOWN OUTFITS; She has NEVER BEEN AN ORIGINAL.
The OBSESSION of Nicki Minaj of WANTING TO BE A WHITE GIRL; and the WHITEST She Can "Become" because She Could NEVER BE ONE. Good thing for her that in this Day & Age they Give Stardom & Fame & Money to CLOWNS LIKE HER.
I am so happy for ice spice going to the met gala and featuring in boys a liar, karma and now working with NIKI MINAJ on the Barbie movie good going 😊
Sean ft Takura - Live show, Gweru  https://youtube.com/shorts/-TCUIgjWP6Y?feature=share

Broooo Nicki??
if you change Minaj's pitch, she sounds like Jay Z
Очень круто
"It's giving me a makeover!" Then they both in splits. "TA DAH!!!".  I died!! Lol
Nicki will forever b the female 🐐of rap…it’s crazy that she can stay relevant after all these years …her and ice should do a joint ALBUM they got good chemistry
Mi amor
Another killer hit🥳
Only one word to describe this:SLAY
Queen ❤😊

It’s grown women wanting to be Barbies for me 😅

She looks so happy to be part of this movie
Are we getting a number 1 or the barbz are sleeping and not buying?
Tasha K sabotage this roll. She sure ain’t for Nicki. TK don’t like her either.

Aquí Los Que Vinieron De Youtube Y No De Otra Red Social 👇
Luv u Nicki. However, I’m glad the Barbie movie was rated PG13 because this song is not appropriate for the little ones who love Barbies. Idk if I’d want my niece jammin to this 😂 You look great tho Nicki

But why does Ice Spice look AI?
We need a homeless barbie and her camp. Since thats our reality. How bout it Hasbro? Or dont you care about those homeless barbie girls. We are human too you know. Are we not worthy of having a barbie doll that represents us too?✨️💓💃🧜
This was really bad.
nikki fr fr summoned a *whole fandom*
Thanks, you ruined it and I hate it.
Ameee
I love them both!!!!!!
🍅🍅🍅
Arte✨💋
Nicki and Spice the best duo ever   👇
Beat is off sync
I came to check this out cos I really thought Nicki would eat this up, this was her moment as we all know Barbie has been her brand all this time. But this is so underwhelming and disappointing, she phoned it in just for a cheque. And the paid ad for some investment app is sooo tacky pls
Gawd Ice Spice is just garbage
I love How Nicki is literally two times  older than ice spice yet they still vibe
0:49, OG barbz died 😩
To all them haters in the comment section, y'all can go outside and touch some grass.  Delusional empty brains haters!!!   I love the music and everything and i will keep streaming and buying ❤💓❤️💞🦄👑💃

Meh its a nicki minaj song what do you expect  2/10
The only thing good about this is that Aquas "Barbie Girl" is in the background otherwise these two rappers are really dreadful. And the song sucks.
I also make music and I'm not at his level yet but I'm striving every day to record with you someday 🐐. It's a dream that I want to make come true 🥹🥹
They did not cook.

When men are not a part of something 😊
Hi barbie 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Ayo, y'all blacks Latinos and natives (Israelites the Bible speaks of) stop worshipping women... Especially women that promote nothing but foolishness. Y'all were not made for the woman so stop acting as if you were.   1 Corinthians 11:8-9 [8] *For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.* [9] *NEITHER WAS THE MAN CREATED FOR THE WOMAN; but the woman for the man.*
What???

No pega ni con cola. Osea, se inventan un rap y le ponen la original de fondo. Fuerte mérito. Eso se llama Mashup de toda la vida y lo hace cualquiera con un portátil

So. I love Nicki Minaj and I love Aqua, but this is so bad. Why couldn't she have treated the song like she did with Anaconda? It's just her rapping over the chorus in the background which makes it so distracting. The tone doesn't mesh at all and it's like they didn't really even try. It feels like Nicky just wrote the wrap, did it, and they added the chorus to "Barbie Girl" in a loop in the background and went "Good enough."
Why is the Nicki Minaj doll white? Lol
Im in LOVE with this song
More like water sugar, running out of ideas fr
What tf did i watch?
Love you guys
Queen nick🥰🥰❤❤❤
No one can make their own beats lately

❤❤🎉
This is SUCH A BOP, Nicki still popping with girls🎉
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Does ice spice have a small case of down syndrome? I know this is an insensitive question but I 100% think this.... the way she talk and her eyes so close together.
Here for the 10th time? 🫶kiss my comment let's ride
F***ck this s*** The actual song from the 90s actually took real talent. But the music industry just keeps reaching new lows…This here is why the youth is so f***k up and braindead! Because of girls like this making dumb a** “music” and using their bodies to sell it to someone way dumber than them… It’s sad, really really sad!
THIS SUCLKS
20:23 Swallow your saliva guys..this is on another   Barbie level❤❤❤
BARBIE NEEDS TO STAY IN HER DOLLHOUSE WITH THIS ONE 🗣🔥🔥
All for barbie's ❤❤❤❤❤❤

I don’t care who did come from Tiktok along with the ones who didn’t, this song is TRASH. We got a middle aged woman with got knows how much surgery and a 24 year old woman just played out for her figure. No talent or skill in this game, and if you like this track then you sad asf.

Está mejor la canción original que esta  XD
*WE REACHED 10M KEEP GOING* 💎‼️
Música ruim

Je préfère la chanson de Dua lipa
Barbie
Es curioso que Mattel hace años demando al Grupo Aqua por su cancion BARBIE Girl Porque la letra no iban con los principios de la Marca y Autorizan esta Sh!t Jajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
This song is awful for the movie. I'm sorry.  But good video effects 👍

Remember coming here when it was just released and now I’m back here again at 28 June 2023 at 1:02 AM!!

Such a fun family friendly song teaching little girls morality and grace.  🤣
This is so nostalgic and us late 80s and 90s babies still remember when we played Barbie’s growing up! Nicki literally MANIFESTED this because everybody know she BEEN the Barbie!
I like it! 💗

Pink ice spice hair?!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
When did music videos become long commercials
Aveces las personas olvidan que la película Barbie también es para niños y no creo que les guste escuchar eso 🫥
I don’t see why some people on Twitter hate this remix , the filmmakers didn’t want to get sued if they used the original and I guess they didn’t want to pay the millions of dollars to aqua to use the original
This is so bad 😂
What is this?
Love you Nicki 🩷🦄🦄🦄🩷💕💘
❤❤❤❤
Cool🤭
Its giving nothing
i said to my bf if nicki doesnt remaster barbie song im not watching then my dream come true.

Nairobi Kenya ❤the hit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely loving this - Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice's 'Barbie World' (with Aqua)! They've taken a classic '90s tune from Aqua and totally reinvented it. Such a killer track - it's got that nostalgic vibe but with a fresh twist. Seriously, it's like my new jam. Keep these bangers coming! 💖🔥🎵
LOL I GOT THIS ON REPEAT SORRY FELLAS LOL IMA TEN SO IM PULLIN BARBIE
Nicki Minaj  jest Super

What a horrible song.

How many times can ice spice do the same thing before people get tired of it? Everything she does sounds the same and I'm starting to hear over recycled lines for sure. 🙄 she found one flow and stuck with it ever since.
Barbiecore
Barbies❤❤❤
Is this even a song?
i love it !!!!
Wooooow
Gotta love this two
Love this song! It did exactly what it needed to do.
One day people will find better ways to use their energy than hating on Nicki. She is dope. Not perfect. But put some respect on her name forreal.

This is why New Yorkers need to start collabing more and and stop being so cut throat. This isn't my taste, but we have missed out on so much potential with NY not sharing and collabing their talent!
Slaaaaaaaaaay🙄💅💅
this is THE worst song nicki minaj has ever made yet 😨..
❤❤❤ pop cultural moment in the happenings
Nickis Barbie necklace reminds me of the bed rock music video she’s in
it took her 15 years to start doing songs with other female rappers instead of always hating on them. and don't get it twisted she ain't tryna help ice spice she hoping on the ice spice train for herself.
10mil already ❤
slay SLAYYYY
it girls
this is so ice spice
Using the OG song as a sample is disrespectful but better than nothing
the olipop cameo 😭
Yeah… great message to give little girls, who you know you marketed this To in part. Teaching them to be slutty. C’mon man!!!
I drive
Is nicki on the s3x offenders list yet?
Innoss'b feat Nicki Minaj
I know a good version of Unghetto This Slaps Too, Vibed🇬🇷🥽
Got it this is for the Barbie movie like Dua Lipa released The Barbie single photo ha ha ha ha ha ha
Y’all think nicki be sa’ing minors with her husband too?

This cured my depression.
twerk this music
THIS SONG SO GOOD😭😭🫶🏻🫶🏻
💟💌💘💝💖💗💓💞💕💋🩷
Finally Aqua smiles last
💗💘💌💟
This is garbage 😂😂😂
This is somewhat nostalgic for us 90s kids.
hoping nicki minaj becomes a muslim one day :)
GIF this :13
10 million & still trending #1 in music!! The Queen & the Princess are undefeated!!!
Barbie 😊❤
👎
I love everything about that moment for them both 😊
slayyy
IT GIRL!!!! STILL IN DOUBT
Really?
Am rooting for anyone to bi my wife (Prof John) ❤❤❤
If nicki, spice, is my wife, I will show them love forever (Prof John) ❤❤❤
NO WORDS... JUST YES🤩🤩🤩
I wanna buy that Barbie
undoubtedly, Nicki makes Tracy Chapman's song Sorry(Baby can I hold you) better. She just preserved it for posterity. Tracy has to drop the lawsuit, take the money and let the song be released into the world. it's already in anyway.
Bass. Yes please
I LOVE THIS SMMM

YESSSSSSSSSSS

BARBZ and Munchkins! 10 million views ✔️! Run this video/song up!!! Buy, stream, and request radio play! 💗👑🧡🎀
I’m just here to dislike
This is hood rat music
No twerking?
Her Royal Highness, First of her name, Queen Mother Barbie Nicki Minaj😊
I like this way better than their first collab.  The first song I was focused too much on their...I guess assets. Well at least for one of them.  The second song I could finally focus on the lyrics too! And both of them must do Uber Eats because they ate their deliveries 😂
Who was here before 10 million views?!😮‍💨🔥

Unghetto - Plastic (2020) is a better song 🤙
Nicky is 🔥🔥 but ice is 🧊🤷🤷🤷
This song stuck in my head it's so hypnotizing  and catchy AF. Nicki and Ice really slayed this oh so good. The Queen is Queening 👑 I play it over and over
It kinda sounds like princess diana 🎯 am I missing something
All I know is Nikki flow 100x better than I’ve spice not saying Ice is bad but Nikki is the queen b real

WAITTTTTTT AYYYYY
Barbie world part2 - sampling the same sample but the male lead vocals "c'mon barbie let's go party" onika & isis singing "ah ah ah yeah. Ohhh oh ohh oh" back up dancers playing hop scotch with drawn on barbie joints on arms and legs 😂 riot on the hard beats in a little barbie dj booth 😂 the girls on the hard bars, guaranteed success 👌🏻   Don't need to pay me for my ideas nicki haha xoxox. Could even dress up as famous versions of barbie, doctor barbie doing a surgical scene on ice. Ballerina barbie, roller skating barbies, camping van set up 👌🏻 beach party barbies
The “slayyy” at the end though 😂         No hate
YESSSSS 💕💅🫶🏾🥹
shoulda keep it the drafts
10 million in just 2 days? Wow
Ice spicy been killing it. Her and nicki fully 💯
Horrible mixing on ice spice vocals

no esperaba nada, pero sencillamente no tiene nada que me haga pensar ni en Barbie (la muñeca) ni siquiera en en Aqua, me siento estafada
Makes me love the original barbie song, funny how someone just talking is considered a song.
Una reina ❤️🙌🏽

Eu amei isso, todo clipe que tem Nick Minaj é estouro. Ice spice tá lançando muita música boa, espero que ela exploda ❤
She looks like a Barbie doll, cause of her pretty hair and makeup. That's why they call her "Barbie." 💕
Mhan I ain't gonna lie, this song is lit, shout out to the producer  for creating this magical beat, its like drill and hiphop😍
😍😍
I’m a barb but this was just boring to watch 😏🫤
My Queen looking amazing <3
Cute video! 💕💕💕
Se supone que es una pelicula infantil no?
La reina del rap ❤❤
👑Queens👑
Trash
My poor little kid brain just thought it was a song about barbie doll.
I can't stop playing over this song
I don't like it this version. "Barbie Girl" with Aqua Is better.
I hate to admit I love this song
I will never stop telling  you guys  that  Nick  is more more mavarous 💙❤
This sucks…
Love Nicki Minaj ❤ ❤ ❤
The only way to watch this video is to put it on mute. I don't like to hear the trash I'm looking at haha 😅
Ay no... Ya la cagaron
Big hit
Can we just APPRECIATE how Nicki laid low for Ice Spice to OUTSHINE her 😢❤❤❤

This Collab with Nicki and Ice Spice is even better than the first one. Every time people think Nicki is going to die-out, she does the exact opposite and that's what I like about her and whether you like it or not she's only going to get better as time goes by. (Not that she's already the best)🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🎶🎶🎶🎶♥♥💯💯
Time to listen on repeat
What on earth is this future generation going to become? I'm speechless!

QUEEEEEEN
So Nicki for NM5, we need about 4 intermissions , a custom barbie playhouse set up concept, different set designs throughout show, 10 dancers, costumes and stage props , a real cute stage design HEAVY ON THE RUNWAY AND LED FLOORS ON THE WHOLE STAGE ICON 😩💕

I wonder how much this video was for 2 minutes ? .. I love Nicki, and ICE has been slowly gaining a piece of my ❤ .. Like the duo. . Hate that this video ends
Nicki is the GOAT!!! There's nothing you can say about her impact on culture...a Barbie with her signature Barbie chain?!!! Give this ICON her flowers!!!!
FUNK RAVE ANITTA

Nice video bad music.
Tiene más ritmo que la canción de Carol
Aqua... legend.
If nicki don't get a Grammy for this!!!! This been #1 for days!!!!! This will show if the Grammys rigged !!!!
The barbie movie look trash 🗑 they should add icep and Nicki to the movie even if it's a last minute ending they walking in gold digging the bougie girls husband dad's friends or whatever man they try to date it will bring life to the movie but I understand it's targeted kids are teenagers I guess
ok y’all is this the full song or not i’m so confused 😭
Wasnt this sweetie idea?
Não teve Kelly Key mas pelo menos teve a Nicki Minaj...
Lovvvvvvvveeee 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Why this is popular
Esse filme não vai ter uma música ruim caramba todas incríveis
NICKI AND ICE ATEEEEE ✨🩷🤌🏻

Vaya manera de cagarse en un clasico
ice spice was horrible
I’m the only person who thinks Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice are mid?
When did songs all become 2 mins long…. Songs used to be all 330-5 mins long. Now everyone’s so trash they can’t rap for more than one verse each lol
Nikki is the best of our time. The BARBIE QUEEN❤❤❤❤
ITS BARBIEEEEEE

Rumors are not true at all!!! Nicki did not outshine Ice, they kkilled it both to the highest level! The amount of balance is amazing! Can't wait for the movie! 😍😍😍
100K dislikes is insane

Queen and Princess 👑👑❤️❤️🔥🔥💕💕🦄🦄🧊🌶️
shi got me like 💅💅😝😝
this keep popping up on my Home Screen, I click it every time
This gave me cancer
I can understand Ice Spice being famous for her aesthetic and personality, but really dont see the appeal for her musical ability, tried giving her a chance, have listened to her whole catalogue, but still just don't understand her rise
Eh... Idk... The rap was not on par with the beat, nor with the original song....
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
This is a hit chile🎉
This song is on fire....look at the views🤗🤗🤗🤗
two words: they ate 💖🛍️
❤❤
This MTV ruin Barbie's good image 🤣🤣🤣
The best duo for real !
우와 노래좋네요
This is trash 🔥
"oh my gosh this is perfect SLAYYYY"
💐💐💐💐💐💐
Up out your face pt 2?
ATE GALOREEE
This was so good
I like the son but the beat is everywhere! Is that a new style. Sound like a low quality & tilt could be better, great artists with awesome lírica, but you do another version removing the Barbie girl chorus.
احبج نيكي
Everyone did awesome getting the Queen of rap to 8 milli 🎉🎉🎉
Why are all of the songs of today/era 2 seconds long 😒 cute song tho
Yesssssssss Barb Nation til I 💀
its crazy because i was telling my sister how nicki and ice spice would make a good barbie doll
I thought it was to short but it finding out the real aqua song wouldn't be feat it made sense because this the barbie movie version basically....
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🍷🥂🍷🥂🍷🥂🍷
not the original one but its something and at least it was in the trailer (:
Ice spice ate but Nicki..
So barbie reject
Who's here after playing this video on repeat? 🔄 What's the one thing you discovered upon repeated viewings?
why does this have so many dislikes 😭😭
I love you Nicki barbie
i dont like it but the video is cute
8 mili... let's run it up barbz!
Ice spice and Nicki brought the baddie energy to a whole new level! ⚡️💅💅 Which part of the video gave you goosebumps?
Like why they thought saweetie was going ever go off like nicki 😅 Nicki specialty is being a Barbie
A hit!
I keep dragging ha so she bald a bit! 😂😂
This is incomprehensibly bad. Poorly produced and even worse lyrics and not to mention the absolute degeneracy. If you like this you must either be a teenager or have cognitive problems. It's a movie for children you muppets.
NEW duo
I like it but it doesn't feel like the quality or level for an mv? Like it sounds incomplete for a commercial or skit. Not trying to hate, I just feel like they had more potential
They playing with the views but it’s okay I’m streaming no matter what BUY BARBIE WORLD & princess Diana
😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I need 4 mins of this bro😭
I'm barbie girl 😌
YouTube playing with these numbers
OMG I LOVE THEM SO MUCHH

My fav line “  Nicki: Pu🐈🐈y so cold we jus chillin out  Ice: And I want the green so I olive it  ❤❤❤ gotta love a good pen

Ice Spice looks like one of the Wayans brothers in the movie Hot Chicks. Nicki's body is so unrealistic. These females gotta lay off the plastic surgery.
I feel like this could have been so much better

Back again 😂? Me 3
Yo solo vine a preguntar: DÓNDE ESTÁ AQUA?????
why are all the comments in spanish
Very bad rendition of the song, we are talking barbie, not so on the corner selling her body barbie type of thing. It was supposed to be awesome and they just sound and look like a s*x plastic thing. I don't like how they ruined the song, I wanted to buy the pink lp, but no thank you with these kind of songs, way to ruin it!
Ice Spice does the same basic rap and they did Nicki sooooo dirty with the blue screen bad quality… Also, like how are you gonna do a Barbie themed music vid and wear shorts and then that weird mullet with the bathing suit and alien shades visor combo??? 😬Yikes
🎉🎉🎉
Nicki had to come down and get a piece of that Bronx drill good move nick
Love what y'all do.
🤮

We will all face judgment for indulging in such indecency. We will all be judged for our departure from God's will and plan for us. We will all face judgement for not walking in his holy way and turning from our sin. I pray you all repent and truly turn to Jesus. This video is nothing but a representation of what happens when we rebel against God and let Satan have us give into our lusts and sinful nature. Our Lusts are never satisfied. But I promise you the power of Jesus can change us to HATE such sin as this. If we trust him and put our faith in him. The end times are here and it's clear. I beg you brothers and sisters, no matter what this culture showcases. Do not be deceived by the enemy. Do not be blinded by the normalization of this perverted culture, where modesty is now bad and decency is now lame. Turn back to the one who can make you whole. I promise this is not to offend anyone I am only a messenger. Please while you still can it will be the most devastating for God to come back and we are still rebelling against him. Jesus Name i pray amen.
I can’t wait to see the Barbie movie 💖💖💖💖💖💖

ATEEEEEE
Anyone more got recommend from YouTube this video? 😅
I like it
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.(John 3:16-21)

I like ice spice, but this song wasn’t for her. Her flow too chill and deadpan for her. Nicki should’ve done this on her own. The vibe needed to have been more hyper and anaconda-ish and fun. Ice Spice is too chill
Getting them ads bread

who wouldve thout that ice spice and nicki minaj are the best duo
AYEEEEEEEE 🕺🏾🕺🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
This the only song I actually like ice flow. She did good. Nicki mentored her really good 😘
I don't get why this was made. I mean, first of all, Mattel tried to sue the Acqua group for making the “Barbie Girl” song so why are they using it now?? Also, isn't this music video too sexy? This has literally nothing to do with Barbie
The next generation bout to be some 304s

Nicki Minaj washed ice spice
Ice Spice once again acting like she doesn't want to be there. Rapping and acting in music video, zero emotions.
I've said since they're first video.  Nicki is training Ice Spice
Ngl icespice was falling off but this brought her right back up
When I here that we were about to get a Barbie movie this is what I was waiting for. They made a better movie than the movie itself !
🔥🔥🌸💕
❤❤❤❤❤

They did real good
Yessss
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮 is how our ancestors look when they see how we exploit ourselves just for money and ah little fame. How will they stand in front of the Lord on  judgment day, and say God are you proud of the legacy I left for your children 🤔  and he will reply depart from me you worker's iniquity I never knew you.

Don’t sleep on “Princess Diana”🙏🏻 Keep stre@ming it
It’s the fact that ice spice is low key flowing like Nicki if there’s anyone to look up to is the best which is no one else but Nick!!!!!

Nicki was truly feeling her doll fantasy. I'm glad Ice looked more awake, usually she has a veryyy sleepy aura in her vidz and here she looks lighted, she was being playful. They both killed it and looked amazing.
Essential viewing for the modern man.

But fr Nicki + Barbie, I BEG for a longer remix, more girls, maybe even Saweetie since she was trying (no shade, i actually think she would complement what's already out), I need like 4 minutessss!!! this your moment! i want more! continue the momentum pleaseeee 🥺 I could also see baby tate. but fr Nicki whatever you decide, i need the longer version, and like another verse from you!!!! A NEED!!!!!!!!!!!!! The remixes Likkle Miss, Super Freaky Girl...I want that 444 this 222! Also was listening to this 90s dancehall rude boy mix the other day on youtube and just wanna applaud you 444 all the samples and homage you gave especially via Megatron and everything else. THEY SLEEPING ON YOUR PEN! It's going over their heads! It went over mine! COMPOSITION!! out of this world!!! PRODUCTION! You're so meticulous 😍 They still discrediting your contributions (for what at this year, IDK, you been legend status and been MOTHER wayyy before papa bear but anyways) ion like that not one bit. It's insane. I truthfully don't understand any hate you receive. You're sooo talented. You are suchhhhh a GENIUS. ANd it's over apparently in every track, I'ma have to call it jealousy. I want them to stop playing with you!!! It's Barbie, but stop playing with ONIKA TANYA. IF YOU WAS EVER IN DOUBT 🤯🤩👑 they gotta move around when the QUEEN is QUEENIN
😍💓
I keep replaying 0:38 😩😩🔥

Not bad ,but not good😮
*i love it*
<<I'm a doll but i still wanna party>> ate !!
The best duo
BARBIE WORLD OMG SLAY 😘
I hate Nicki’s psychotic and schizophrenic like body movements. Please stop. Can anyone explain to me why she does those movements? I’ve only seen patients in psych wards do these kind of movements and facial expressions.
I’ve said what they gone say now
This génération is lost my god where the talent the creative music  😮  its sad for you 😱🥳
it could have been better beat wise
This is what happens when the recording studio and camera's are in your house  ✓SUBTOMENOW
Not from tiktok
The competition a Kickstarted rap all over again
Signs 🔥
the real IT GIRLS in the female rap
Yikes !!!!¡ this old spice ruins everything 😒

More visual of this queen nicki
Queen
As a 45 year old asain man who grew up in Compton, i can truly say without a doubt, ice spice carried taylor swift in that song called Karma. Taylor needs to bow down to the real queen of pop. Its time our people got the recognition they deserve
They ruin the classic iconic barbie song
❤❤❤❤❤🧜🏽‍♀️🧜🏿‍♀️🧜🏿‍♀️💕💕💕💕💕💥💥💥💥💥
why are men in the comments this song is for women
Real Barbie ❤
My name is Stacie my mom got the spelling from the 90’s Barbie (Stacie and Ken doll) 😂thanks Nicki 💜
Slayed 💯 Go Nicki ✌🏽
Nicki is way to old for that , it's kinda sad

Hollyy wow🎉
IM A BARBIE GIRL
Idc the hate I get for my comment, I am 23 and black and absolutely hate this music. I'm not referring to Nicki because she always makes it a hit, she flames anything she touches. I'm talking about Ice Spice like this is really what we're calling rap now? When you like rap from the 90s, this doesn't sound like music. It dead a** sounds like something someone in a movie would get tortured to. play this 1000 times and your brain will be mush. this is what america is- a joke
Yess omg
It really is Nicki’s World When it come to this female rap game! The sooner everyone understands that the better off they’ll be.    p.s Cardi finally starting to get it!
Nicki come to Brazil
Buu 🫠
🇧🇷
every mans dream, loved this song both amazing rappers!!!!
YESSS💅🏽

I prefer nicki and ice spice than ice spice and Taylor swift… like Taylor is so cool but ice spice being there is like she was forced against her will… like ice spice was built for rapping

Why so short....?😭😭
too quick that you can barely enjoy the music and the visuals from the video, everything so fast, I mean it's ok if it's rap but at least make it enjoyable, I just put the video and sat to watch it and suddenly it just ends... really enjoyable if you play it at slow speed, though

This remake is an insult to Aqua ...
yes
Not to be rude Nicki is an icon but for the last 4 years or so she's been super lazy with music and even performances it's like she's not being paid for what she's doing and ice spice is very cool she slayed this but she's kinda boring to witness she needs to come up with some gimmicks for when her career starts declining every artist needs those gimmicks tbh
these two girls need to drop an album together
This is the most stupidest sh?t I heard 2023 🗑️😳
It’s garbage though…

NICKI YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE ❤
As much as I am a fan of everything leading up to this (artists, source material)...this is one of the worst things I've seen and heard in a while.
Nick has FUN on this one 🤣😍😍😍😍
This sounds... Excruciatingly bad. I mean, audio Mastering is by far off for modern standards and the video is just the dumbest portrayal of Babrie Girl ever. You know Barbie actually 'slayed', right? This is just a feeble minded attempt of doing...I dunno... Something.
Eu tô viciado nisso🎉🎉

Why do the barbies look so different?   All of the barbie filters coming out are lightening the skin tones and changing eye color. Ice spice doesn’t have bright blue eyes. What happened to diversity, Barbie?

Happy to see Aqua listed in the title. They deserve a ton of credit for their songs they are great!
Rainha
Song of the year…prepare to hear this over and over everywhere you go 😞
MEMORIES
All of the Barbies bad 😍😍
I know y’all don’t like Saweetie but her chorus would’ve went bomb with them rapping !
Nicki just shows you longevity is everything.
All I gotta say is…… gyat
Nicki Queen❤
I love how Nicki always adds her own flow but still manages to match the themes of the artists she works with!
What a song I like the way Nicki and spice manage to make such a legendary song
Who Wants to Be Fake and Plastic Like a Barbie 😂
From a Roblox character to a Barbie toy. 😂
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I'm in my mid 40s so when Aqua dropped the original Barbie song it was in every club every where and constantly playing on the radio to come back and give this song a 2nd life is everything but in a cool way.  Ice Spice is amazing too and did her thing.
This is the new hot girl summer anthem 🫠🫠
unpopular opinion it’s mid but Ice Spice carried the song hard 😬
Maybe i will Remix that Track
nicky minaj so good at rhyming yeah yeah
❤❤❤❤
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PERIODDDDDDDD YESSSSSSSSSS

Nicki should have had this on her own! She IS a Barbie. I get the new girl is popular but give the queen her time. She kept grinding for 2 decades for this.
Why does Ice spice looks like when someone does a white skin edit on a black person
I wish I would’ve seen this sooner. I am so obsessed. I keep replaying it because it’s that great.
Another hit
Pink mullet riding a jet ski… 😕

Nicki will never be washed. She the first baddie to hit the internet 😭
Ice Spice has dead eyes, she has zero charisma. Nikki is giving life tho! Hope Aqua is getting paid well for their classic
Its sounds better everytime i listen to it, both of their verses are SOO satisfyingly good!

Best collaboration ❤
NICKI IS THE MF GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!! <3333  (like if u agree) <33333
I love this whole vibe but why it so short? Coulda been twice the nice.
They need  a 32d song because Nicki has yet to prove she is really the goat. yeah she sayin she is but she is not really backing it up with her bars. Ice spice took this one and the first song also tbh.
nicki troca mais de flow nessa música do que a card b troca de rosto 😂

🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I know they know the difference!!!!!💗
Das hat mit Musik gar nichts zu tun. Einfach nur schlecht
Underwhelming, if I’m being honest. But at least Aqua made some money off this. Part of me kinda wants to see this beat underneath Aqua’s original vocals.
Mega cute
omfg
Filo barbz!! Make this #1 trending in the Philippines, we're already #12!!!!!!!!!!❤❤

Queen and princesss!
❤❤❤❤

I really want to like this song but it sounds a little Chaotic
Like the song am a song critic ...am.goin to give this a 6 or 7 out of 10, why?! Well the song for me is meeh..nicki can do better like for real....as for ice spice? Don't hv a comment 😢
This video got everybody calling they self a Barbie now 😂 I been one 🫶🏽
Amei
POR QUE DURA TAN POCOOOO
🤣💀
it's crazy cuz I started listening to the OG barbie song and put it in one of my playlists like a few days before this song came out
I love the SLAYYY part at the end 😭

Yay
OK, but the product placements are RIDICULOUS
mother.

and I am bad like the bawbie 💖
Nicki really puts in so much hard work and sweat in whatsoever she does. NO wonder she turned down this song many times from different people. SHE had to make sure it was perfect enough and she put the right amount of BARBIE into it. I mean, the way she sits like a human doll at the beginning, talk about creativity💕💜💞💋🦄
👍👍.
5 Million views ✔️ BARBZ and Munchkins! Keep running this video/song up!!!  💗👑🧡🎀
They sound unenthusiastic
Nicki Minaj was the perfect person for this type of song!!!!!
i luv this song

Love Nicki, but wish she'd stop collabing with Ice Spice.

True fact :  We can all agree that Nicki Minaj never disappoints, her talent is pure and her voice is out of the world!
還是原版的好聽多了 一直碎碎念是在噗嗤喔？
Gra

I love Nikki but it’s annoying me this ice spice girl thinks she can come for ppl and owns the world for saying *grah* which only got famous from luck in my opinion. Come at me if u want Ik it’s an unpopular oppinion.
I love Nicki Minaj
I’m a bit disappointed!! Nicki you can do better than this 😌
Me gusto este tema de Nicki , el de Karol g no me gusto siento que no va, mi opinión sin ofender y sin tirar hate a nadie

One thing I love about nicki is, there is no other artist like her. She has been able to really brand her style no one can follow.. that duo personality rap no one has been able to do it.. also it helps she writes her own raps!
Who else loving this Nicki ice duo LIKE🦄🔥
I wanted to like this song so bad but it being 1 minute… disappointing
I’m so surprised Nicki took this long to get on this beat…this was always perfect for her!!!
Worst thing about this was the old-fashioned dancers in those stiff outdated suits, and the green of the green screen that was not removed around Ice Spice. Best thing was everything else
Da way ice spice says grahh all the time lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
take over duo
y nicki endorsing the trashest upcoming female
Grahh
Ice spice and Nicki both slayed again together❤❤❤
Voa Nicki você merece todo sucesso.

Me gusto más la versión de @ZEIMOON
ATE??!!!
Keep dragging her, so she bald a bit ^^ Not done dragging her, so don’t pick up the Bih. I SEE WHAT ICE DID. This the first time I heard a female keep up with Nic on a SONG !? 😭❤️🤣 #TEAMBarbz

Bekar
I just opened youtube and then watching Nicki...
Better than Princess Diana???
Can’t get enough I’m obsessed ❤
They should have included Lola Brooke in with them. It's a nice spin though they did that.
🫣❤️‍🔥
I guess
BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. GOOO NICKI 👑👑👑🦄🦄🦄
This was pretty good, but no song can compare to The Cat’s Meow from Barbie: the Princess and the Pauper.
I'm a fan
OH MY GOSHHHHH🎉🎉🎉
BEFORE THE MILLION OF LIKES
CHEWED
The Queen did it again❤
The collab we've all been looking forward to seeing 👏🏽
Horrible
Que aburrido y simple suena como cualquier promedio que hace ella pense que seria un track interesante
This is pure pop/rap perfection! The classic Aqua ‘Barbie Girl’ sample… i have lowkey been waiting on Nicki to sample “Barbie Girl” her entire career, since she has single-handedly kept the “Barbie” aesthetic alive & well for the last 15 years… so this so amazing to see! And Nicki’s pink look on the jet-ski here 😍 love u Queen Nicki!
THIS IS SO GOOD HOW 😭
Podrian haber hecho algo mejor... 😢
The best day ever...❤️
🔥🔥
Ice spice didn't know who she was but now she's trending because of Taylor and Nicki!!!
I’m so in love with Nicki and ice
The princess and the queen 😘👑🦄💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

It’s Barbie and it’s Ice Spice WHOA!
I love it 😍😍💗
Cheap BET commercial for corner store barbies
ATE
🔥🔥🔥
🥵🌡️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
i hope aqua got some for this
It’s kinda weird how fast Nicki jumped on the Ice bandwagon. Especially with her history of not working well with other female artists…. But I guess when you need a hit you do what you gotta do.
YASSSS!!!! #BARBIEWORLD
this was everything
this song is better in instrumental version.
Nicki and ice spice should be a permanent team
yesssssssss lets go
Ofc Barbie music is incomplete without the head of all the barbies- Nicki Minaj

Exclusive barbie commercial 😂😂❤
What’s the concept of the large nikkki?
Best clip ever
I find it so crazy how rap loves to tag females against each other, now their trying to say ice spice did harder than the Queen are y'all silly its tag Team not twister  an the dummys that falls in the trap of da games,fails to exceed. Nicki Wins.
Those men in the black suits are Fine
At first I wasn't feeling it but nickie slayed
love the song but nicki kinda carried-

Ice Spice should work and learn from Nicki Minaj more. The plastic/Barbie swag matches ice spice perfectly IMO

I hope this song isn’t in the movie ☠️
The "Hi barbie","Hi barbie" is sooo iconic period 💅🏾

Hannah Lux Davis is literally the best director i know like have you seen (Ariana Grande’s MVs) and many singers too
“When you are legendary, you shine no matter what”

fitting that this too would be plastic throwaway garbage.
Nicki minaj with this white doll being portrayed as her,  tells me enough lol .. at least Ice spice doll is actually her skin tone.
Wow So Good

Our Barbie and queen 💛
Kudos to the men in suits 😂
Is ice spice the new barbie?!?! Did Nicki just choose her heir 👀?!?
Keep watching barbzzz

Omg i like the collaboration
Its a bich
The 2nd collaboration, we needed it in our lives.
GRAHHHHH
Haters used to said that Nicki doesn't support new female rappers but she actually does it for the ones who deserve it and who really have talent. Not to those who don't even write their own rap🤡.
Even more hyped for the movie lol
https://youtube.com/@RHFun_TV1M
Come on barbs, let’s get these views up for the Queen
The west is falling
Nicki and cardi will pull in a hit😊
Word perfect song for plastic girls , they should of have more females in it maybe the remix 😂
Respect for Nicki and Ice Spice but I prefer Aqua solo version.. We can deny is more catchy and funny. ✍️💯🙌
loooooooooooooooooove the song but video lacks BUDGET.. I can tell its Chroma key green/blue screen when Nicki is giant... WHERE IS ALL THE BARBIE REFERENCES???  like why didnt Nicki give all of barbies different personas??? THIS WAS THE BIG BARBIE MOMENT?!?!?!?!
I love the makeover scene ❤ Afros for life ❤
I'm from TikTok
I love you both sooo much keep up the good work
This must be for the soundtrack that’s on 27th

I thought the first part was an ad
Straight trash

If you’ve heard 1 ice spice song you’ve heard them all
This comment section like how much are they paying you
Omg very good😍
This is trash. You people need to stop being influenced so easily, and most importantly, stop being fake.

This song is solid, there’s like only one scene that’ could’ve been created better, & that’s Nicki with the blue shadow and little guys at the bottom. That could’ve been executed better.   I love scene with the clouds . I love them men dancing together   The song is solid. Fasure . princess Diana !!! & the QUEEN

I love ice spice flow of music when the beat drop it just hit different👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
I loved it 😍 🦄💖💖💖💖💖💖
Una obra de arte en lo absoluto
Yes Queen
Nicki nunca decepciona. Te amo mi reina hermosa 🎉😍🥹
I'll fade away and classify myself as obsolete
I wish they had a more catchy hook
this is amazing
They’re other song I’m sorry I didn’t like and so I didn’t expect much from this but for real they brought it. It reminds me of the same vibe as feelin myself with her and Beyoncé. This song really does hit.  Edit: also Ice spice gets a lot of hate I feel cause she came up so quick and is everywhere but let’s be real her voice is great her bars are decent and she makes good music. I get getting annoyed when a new artist comes out and everyone talks about them but she at least has talent to back it up. And I honestly am the first to hate on something even though I shouldn’t. But with her she really is great and I’m excited to see where she goes.
Lo mejor #queens
Te amamos
This version just as wack as Aqua's 1997 version. SMH stop the wackness.

The only reason I be upset is because I WISH IT WAS LONGER 😢❤❤❤ nicki always Eat
Jeez ice spice had nicki Minaj with her, a badass instrumental, and everything to cause her career to skyrocket. If she couldn’t hit her potential with nicki Minaj with this type of instrumental, she’s never gonna make it. Whoever is promoting her is doing a great job. The problem is her.
Nikki found her it girl😻
They ate this all the way up💫🎇
💕🫶🏽💕🫶🏽💕

I’m here for the beat kuz I always thought the og was fire. I don’t like the beat changes like at 0:38 for example tho 😕 and I’m not fans of theirs but I noticed how Nicki is saying “…like” like ice spice did, I think the support is cute!

This is such a cute video. I hope We can get a remix with “Ken” 😁  a male artist on the remix would Be 🔥🔥
ice, riot, and nicki rly fumbled with this one ngl. surely there was a better way to remix the barbie song as a sample
The barbz are sleeping why did song haven’t reach 10 ml in the first 24 hours … two more hours for 24 hours since the song released and this song stick at 3.1 ml smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Queen Nicki never disappoints with her lyrics! She is creative and flexible in her subject. She is a luoon artist who knows how to warm up her fans! This is the legend! Her talent clearly speaks for itself!
Barbie
Barbie world should be a rap dance song like starship
Yesssss

Is this the same song they last had + all the past 4,099 songs Ice Spice had..?? I'm confused..they all sound the FCKN SAME..........?¿? tf???

At first I thought Ice Spice was trash and just some kind of Tiktok one hit wonder but her voice is actually so soothing
you deserve this BARBIE 😭💖
Flop and Trash 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't believe it is a song....pls work harder biatches

Glad they sampled Aqua! 😃
This sing is a bop lets keep the views up
This could be a commercial for any product in 2023. "Disconnect" is the hottest trend right now.
The men in black dancing in background are not adding up with the video looked like they were hopping around!  Could've been more barbies!
"B*TCHES AINT GOT PUNCH LINES OR FLOW, I HAVE BOTH & AN EMPIRE ALSO " Nickis brand is so legendary,. There will never be another nicki in the game.
Not the album drop on my birthday
She looks amazing for after having a baby her body looks just like it did before she was pregnant and had her baby 🍼 she must of had a good trainer and products to help reduce starch marks cause I see none

❤❤❤❤❤
y r dere so many mexicans in the comments
You bettah come thru then Nicki and Ice Spice.. Nicki  Minaj is doing an amazing job at making sure her artist topples chart after chart
No ghost writers. No gimmicks. No Clout chasing. No Sympathy. Just pure raw talent and devoted fans. She definitely deserves her flowers and recognition for all her hard work!! I love you Queen!!
I love the fact that it was 2 little black girls playing with Barbies that look like them in the Barbie World video. That is major! There was a time when little black girls had no representation with Barbie dolls. A lot of us had a Cabbage Patch or homemade Raggedy Anns.
I love this! Nicki is just so pretty
I’ve spice moving right, picking the wining team.
Dressed inappropriate with lyrics that have inappropriate double meanings. Especially since the topic is a kids toy called "Barbie". And we wonder why the kids are getting worse and dressing worse. This is their influence now days.
This for a kids movie
1000th time watching 😭😭🩷
And just like that I’m obsessed 😍😍
Nicki's bars were genius and the word play was a brilliant!! You can definitely tell she is very intelligent and has a lot of wisdom!! Her flow and technique is flawless!! She spit so effortlessly and fluently!! Her breathe control is perfect and she articulates her lyrics clearly!! Nicki is so versatile the way she constantly and smoothly switches up her flow!! This song is fire 🔥
LIKEEEEE!!!!!
MY QUEEN!!!!!!!!!
I tried to listen to it a few times just for me to find love in that track but it's barbie flop for me. I barbie waited coz the preview was hard but they gave Annabelle. Disaster barbie.
HEAVY ON IT !!!!
❤❤❤❤
ATEEEE
❤❤❤❤
Really cool. Wish it was longer! Brings back awesome memories mixed with Nicki vibes.
Been waiting for this hit to drop, it's Barbie bishhhh
I've literally spent the whole day listening to this on repeat. Yet another brill colab between the Queen and her princess 💖
please mommy I would do anything please make an OF I would literally do anything for it
SLAYYYYYYYY

ITS BARBIE BTCH U SHOULD JOIN DA WAVEEEE !!!!! 🌊 😅💸🌸💕🎀💄👛👚🦩
Gonna keep this one on repeat
YESSSSS NICKYYYYY
They ate this up!!! Nicki I love everything about the visuals, lyrics, flows!!
I'm disappointed. It feels lazy and unfinished. It is criminally too short. The original song stays in the background the entire time when I expected its chorus to at least be solo. They just put a beat on it, had Nicki and Ice Spice rap, and called it a day. It feels like the song is missing a proper beginning, a bridge, chorus... I don't know the technical terms, but it's missing a lot. Something tells me if Nicki did this alone she would have dialed things up to 100 and went ALL out.
Oh my gosh this is PeRfeCt 🥰 🥰  that really got meee😂😂
Sooo slayyyyyyyyy
OMG THEY ATE
It's okay...
😅👎this song is bad
I love Nicki and Ice spice togetha!! They give sexccc and i love that 😍
...
This is nice to see
Definitely a Barbie with all that plastic 😂

BARBIEEEEEE
I know I’m in the minority here, but I love Aqua. While Barrie Girls prob my least favourite song by them I love this. I also love Nicki so this really works for me. While I’m not familiar with Ice Spice’s solo work I like her parts here! It’ll be exciting for Aqua to get their second top ten in the US hopefully too. It may pass Barrie Girls peak even!  (Aqua’s US label ROBBED the group by the single choices/lack of them here)

would it really be a barbie movie is nicki wasnt involved
Slayyyy
Imma Barbie!!!💅🎀🥰🦄
this is MY song of the summer
Olipop about to sell out quick
Nicki has her own unique way of rapping which is unlike any other artist. Plus the word play and intellectual lyrics that she puts in her personal music shows she is beyond talented but I really like the fact that Nicki Minaj choose to change up her style, flow, and cadence to make sure she would sound good with Ice Spice's flow while still incorporating Nicki's style as well. That shows she is very experience and versatile which is why she is the Queen!! Nicki has always been amazing with switching up her flow to match the beat or flow of the song. Nicki Minaj is undoubtably extremely versatile! I definitely believe she deserves her flowers, respect and recognition!
This video is so freakin cute
4 hours left run these views upppppppppppp🎉🎉🎉🎉
😍😍😍😍
Wow
I love ice spice in this somg
ปังมาก
I absolutely love this song!! I keep listening to it over and over!! I don't like some of the newer hip-hop that is out nowadays!! To me it's lost a lot of resemblance of what it use to be but this song was great and makes me feel good!! That's also why I love Nicki so much because she has always stayed true to the art!! True hip-hop is about meaningful and intelligent bars!! The ability to tell a story in their music that people can relate too! Nicki brings all the good qualities and traits of old school plus the ability to incorporate new school hip-hop by keeping her beats and lyrics fresh!! It's great to see her style is rubbing off on some of the newer artists!! It's obvious that there are countless artists has been greatly influenced and inspired by Nicki which is so wonderful to see and hear!! Nicki and Ice Spice did an amazing job!! I think they complement each other very well!! I really hope they do more songs together in the future because their songs are definitely hits!!

This was very very fun! Are those jet skis flying or are they on imaginary water like how Barbie has a cold imaginary shower in the movie trailer? I have flying jet ski-like things like that in my own story writing dating back to 2012 (Nicki is a main character as are a bunch of other celebs and we go on awesome adventures together) and this is awesome to see something possibly similar! Hope to get to see the movie soon!  Been a fan since 2010, keep being amazing, Nicki CrazyFanKristi

It's the perfect AD for the movie!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where exactly was Aqua?
🎉❤❤❤
The Queen 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This would of been a great opportunity to put Nicki and Kim on a song together, ice spice is cute but she sounds like she's just talking. They really working overdrive to make her happen not sure it's gonna happen , the Diana song was ok but this and the Taylor swift Collab sound so forced not earcandy.. when she sounds bored like she's falling asleep.
I be coming back to view this video like 5 time already 🤧
❤❤❤
I love queen! ❤️
❤ Can't stop listening 🎧
looks like KICO “look like” lol
Nicki been barbie but Kico actually did a Barbie coming to life video first

All I got to say is this was soooo caaaaauuuuuuuteeeeee 🥰😍
BARBIES ATE
🎉
🎉
🎉🎉
Yasssss Muvaaa
I like Nicki ironically, but this single is literally the worst song ever, and sounds like a shitpost song someone made, and that's not a compliment, because I know this was made with the most sincere seriousness. Whoever did the mixing must have brain parasites because it's a muddy garbled mess, that leaves nothing, especially spoken parts understandable.
100/100
serviuuuuu
💞🛍️🎀🥰🫶🏾
Nickis fast verse is a 10 I'm obsessed
acima dela, ninguém
I wish black barbie was the official song for the movie .. better than this one

Trash 🚮🚮🚮🚮
OMFG. Playing this on repeat. The queen delivered as expected but Ice... She's even better than i expected. Love Nicki's barbie poses and how she still keeps to her image with twerking and all. The visuals are amazing and @1:20 nicki reminded me of Va Va Voom video. Such a nostalgic moment. Obsessed with Nicki's animated and Ice's sly voices. Can't wait for this song to shatter billboard 100.
F*ckin fire 🔥😍
Porque ice spice esta con esa senora. No me gusts 👎
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latinos are definitely Nicki Minaj fans. All these comments in Spanish and french wow...increible
Ice spice is amazing and so very lucky and blessed to be working with the queen herself!!! What an accomplishment! ❤
Imma Ken so I pull in a Ten❤🎉
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ngl this was kinda a flop girlies :(
Ohhhh, Aqua really had my interest as to what you were going to do with it, yet you just used it as background noise.  That was quite disappointing.
You dont just put Nicki on the background! Have some respeeeeeeect 👿
This was disappointing asf

Love it!! Nicki standing over the men dancing 🙌🙌
As a fan I'm genuinely disappointed. Nicki is the Queen of bars and in this one she landed not even ONE. Her lyrics was so basic, that's proof her fan base is an army because she can sell y'all anything. Ice Spice came in with bars tho congrats to her
the music video is sooo beautiful
Let's keep streaming for muva!! 🦄🇿🇦
This is the cutest video
Love the bars ❤
ICE SPICE ATE NICKI UP ON THIS,, but HOW?!  I NEVER Thought I would be able to say this?? Whats going on? I'm perplexed.

Stop playing with Nicki they need to give her Awards in ALL music awards she's the queen, and she has been giving us all the best music hits after hits, after hits. She is consistent with her work so idk if it's the Grammy Awards who hasn't really been nominating her, but they need to start nominating her and giving Nicki her Awards and that's final. She the queen 👸💗💕💗
Oooh Mother mother mother
They keep hating but still watching 🥱
Team Barbie  👇👇

I’ve watched this video more that 23 times since this morning started. I wanna be a BARBIE GIRL 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Me hubiera encantado escuchar a la ORIGINAL BARBIE GIRL - AQUA de 2010  en la próxima película BARBIE 2023 🦄💋🩷✨
“I’m a doll but I still wanna party”
I thought the glitter sound on the snippet was part of the beat. When ice goes “like grahh” *kahcling*
GRATTTTTT 💕✨💯👠🔥😮‍💨 QUIT PLAYING WIDDEM RIOTTTTT 🫨 THE QUEEN & THE PRINCESS
More of a BRATZ girl but I love Nicki n I respect Ice an awful lot so this song makes me wanna be Barbie for a day
😍💞

I love thissss
Someone make this slow and reverb!!!
i miss the old minaj..
Did anyone even listen to ice spices verse?
I love this!!
They did what needed to be done 💖
No está a la altura de la  inolvidable e icónica original BARBIE GIRL de AQUA, pero como remix o nueva versión intenta dar lo mejor y suena agradable ❤❤❤
Ice Spice definitely was keeping up w/ Queen. I like how Queen was able/ willing to lower her stamina a bit to not outdo Ice so she could side and keep up 🙏🏾💕🤎🙏🏾 Big Barbie♐️
Yasssss

Why they destroy Barbie like this 🥴  They are beautiful and talented don’t take me wrong  But Barbie es diferente is not a stripper 😂😂😂
Ok so I am going to need like an extra 2 mins or so it wasn’t long enough I wanted Nicki to do another verse 🥰
❤
I’ve watched this video like 8 times already lol
Barbie !!
LOVE!! Such a bop and the music video is iconic ❤
Let me tell y’all something this one is it just a vibe, how can you not like this LIKE? just child good memories and new school fireeee Nicki is the best
Creí que sería más icónica...
Esta Ice spice hace que cualquier cancion en que canta suene igual nmms, canta cob el mismo tono, el ritmo es lo mismo, se nota que solo por el trasero que se carga es que la siguen
trash
OMG! Sem comentários pra tanta perfeição😍
yess❤
AAAAHHHHHHHHH 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
nicki gon eat all the new industry girls up that’s facts 💗 she da real barb
The duo is a 😌perfect song perfect 😜🤑🥵
This would have been a crazy HipPop record had it featured Doja Cat.  I'm all for equal opportunities, so I'm happy Nicki wrote a verse for the albino young lady and featured her.
IT GIRLS AND WE AINT PLAYIN TAG 💕🎀🥂💗💘💓💖
ICONIC BOP
I love the part where Ice is looking for her mother using telescope
Wow.. this is horrible lol.

This goes way too hard
Nicki minaj is the QUEEN OF RAP
I'm always speechless when it comes to Nicki.. Man, speechless.
The views likes and comments don’t add up but the production is divine and I’m loving Nicki’s hair
there's a little mistake at 0:41-0:43 the B is shaking a bit :D
😅 that was it? I was expecting more idky
I keep dragging her so she bald a bit 😅😅😅
This song is trash and they did a terrible job….. why would they let these two ruin this song 😫 they had no idea how to ride this beat. Ice spice can only rap on a very similar beat too.
So good 🩷
Who’s disappointed too?😔🤡
❤❤❤❤
rainhaaaa
It’s the Barbie facial expression’s for me ❤
Atp I think they’re sisters now
I love the Barbie Aesthetic 💗

Dei kandaravoli
I love Nikki but this song doesn't cut it for me.  Side note, not a fan of Ice Spice.  Kinda confused about some of the choices in the hip hop game in general actually.
"I'm a 10 so I pull in a Ken" 👅 This is just too 🔥 reminds me of my Barbie doll birthday cake🎂 for my 10th bday😍🎉
💃💃💃💃✨✨✨

Trash

HOLY SHII THEY ATE
Me encanto ❤
This not kid friendly not for my 9 year old they could of did this without cursing
I'm so PROUD of NICKI 😭. I was a little girl when the original song came out. No black Barbie in sight. Nicki has been our black Barbie since day one.
IM SCREAMINGGG😍😍
SLAYYYY BARBIEEEEE ❤❤❤❤❤❤
We need at least 2 more mins added ❤
it's not a barbie film without nicki song
Finally hit a million...shame it took 10 hours
It already got 1 million views dang!
Queen 🥺

Longer version please nicki and spice!
I'm not girly but I love it on Nicki. Larve it.
NICKI WITH A WOLF CUT OH MY GOD????
I'ma Doll but,  I still want to party..... Aaaaa 💃
NİCKİ U ATE ❤💅
This sounds just like the other song they made together Princess Diana! I’m mad they wasted this sample!!
💕🦄
iconically
0:24 ____ "Rad" WHO STARTS A VERSE LIKE THAT ISKCON DU
N WE AINT PLAYING TAG 😛🦄
yess queen
I love this video so much!! Y’all ate and look so beautiful
i ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The music video is amazing
This  music is just the vibes ❤❤❤❤❤
Better without ice
Is Ice spice saying “Jazzy, Stacie, Nicki” or “Jenny” ? I’ll love this song sooo much if she says Jazzy
Odie el final  No promuevan que las niñas hagan eso con sus muñecas
If this is in the Barbie movie I will freak
💅💖🌸🎀💗👛💓💝
yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss❤🎉
Freaking snapped ate left not a piece of Crumb Grrr

A hit
Yassss!! I love it nicki!!! 🎀🎀🎀🥰🫶🏻
YESSSSSS 😍😍😍😍😍
On repeat ❤
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
queens
Love it❤️❤️❤️
This song feel so long but it's only 1m30 I don't feel that track at all Nicky's verses are always the same and Ice Spice has the rap energy of a Xanax pill there's no umph. Maybe in 2014 it would have been fresh but nowadays it's just not. It's another Nicki collaboration with X name. Nothing new and with the trends of sample at least use Barbie Girl for something fun no this...
Phenomenal 🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes mother I love it🤪💅🏾
Why doesn’t the Nicki doll have darker skin. This is disappointing 😅
💕💖💕💖
AHHHH WOKE UP TO THIS YAAAAASS <333 love it
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
#icespice
Love you nicki
🎀🎀🎀🎀💖💖💖💖💖💖 ALL THE BARBIES ARE BAD, IT GIRLS! & WE KEEP PLAYING TAG!!!!
Trash Trash Trash
I watched this video for like an hour last night 😂☝🏾🔥
COLLAB OF THE YEARR
This song just fits then perfectly
nicki spicy barbie ( q) chicken 😋😋
FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Nicki gives Isis so much confidence. She wasn't like this in videos before
This song should open the movie in between scene and credits to this big of a score artist like isis n onika together for 2nd time is crazy... Especially since they not focused on streams or airplay due to it being a licensed soundtrack single... Love them both equally god loves the number three so let's see if they can bring barbies dream house to have a hot girl summer!
I was hoping they would do more with the sample, my expectations were too high for this song Im afraid
This sounds like princess Diana
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ummmmm what? I’m speechless I knew Nicki was going to slid but Ice ate and did what needed to be done  and she was sending them shots omg 😱 somebody help those girls
thank you for this
MOTHER❤❤🎉🎉

I honestly think Ice Spice is everything Nicki was looking for in a younger artist that she could mentor, Nicki found what she needed in Ice that she didn’t find in Bia no shade…
Wish it was longer than 2 minutes
This just makes me want to go listen to the original song. It's way more fun!

Why is the thumbnail just a random frame at 47 seconds where Nicki is mid blink? One'd think that a production company as big as the one behind this would know how to add a proper thumbnail before uploading.

Nicki outfits let me down 😢 except that bathing suit . Nicki has give us so many Barbie looks and then the stylist pulled this Minnie Mouse look and then a chola look such a let down for a barbie video from the queen of barbie camp.
THIS is the official soundtrack to the Barbie Movie and NO ONE can change my mind!

Te amo Nicki, mas não deu... Achei bem ruim 😢
I want people to sit back and see what this does to the minds of young girls.  I never let my daughter play with barbies.  And for them to sexualize this makes it even more crazy.  Young girls want "perfect bodies" and wanna look like barbies
I LOVE IT. IMA DOLL TOO😍❤️💋🎈🛫

I like the visuals, but the song lacks. I was wishing for something more fun.
Claim your "before the million" here
Nicki is a Legend 🔥 The fact that she's not ready to give up is inspiration. She's the Queen 👑 and she knows it. Let her continue to create magic ✨
YOOO
Ice spice looks so good with this wig
She should've said "and we come wit a tag"
Dope!!!
flop
So cool !
So beautyfull❤❤❤🎉🎉
Should of had Queen Herby as well.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
at least the chorus ate
Yeah, this is terrible. Why does this Ice Spice person have a career? Because Taylor Swift's boyfriend said something bad about her isn't a good enough reason.
I feel like there could’ve been so much more potential with this music video and instead of creativity I got Jetskis in the clouds 😭
Nicki was hollin 😂
Ice spice look albino. 😮 she made nicki look dark skin.
💕💗💖💞💓💘🌺💐🎀🌷🌷🌷🐽👙🐖💗💗💓💓!!!!!!!

I 🩷 this so much . #BarbieGang
they ate
They always playing with the Queen views!
With all due respect, no shame or ill-ill but... this is one of the worst things I've watched or listened to. The issue is that it's so fast, so rushed... It could've been an awesome track or video but it has no room to breathe, i pressed play and it was over.
love love Let's stream guys
Lol
I love you nicki

I'm Mad this is trash.

Straight fire

QUEEN
she the best
FINALLY, I loved it and it only make sense that the queen of Barbie did the song it was definitely worth the years and years of waiting. Literally no else could have done the lead single for this movie. And for those saying it was not good what were you expecting this is a KIDS movie and soundtrack she’s not gonna rap and talk like she would on a regular NM Album. She embodied bein a fictional character, A BABRBIEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Visuals🔥🔥🔥
Nicki has always been a barbie
princess 💋💋

I’ve been rocking with nicki since her mixtape days. And to see where she is now just makes me so happy. Idc what no one says but this woman is smart, intellectual, humble, naturally beautiful and definitely knows her worth and went after what she manifested. And literally is legendary. Y’all can hate if y’all want but you can’t deny her impact and what she bought to the hip hop game. I love me some nicki and always will!
THIS IS AMAZING AND I'M NOT EVEN A FAN OF ICE SPICE.

Jesus Christ.... What is this?
Cool video
Nicki better not be writing her raps. No one else was made for this song BUT NICKI!!!!!❤ idk why Ice is on it. She doesn’t match Nicki’s energy whatsoever. Doja would’ve been a better addition. Doja & Nicki mesh energetically, metaphorically, unpredictability & then some but cute song. Would’ve been better if it was just Nicki.
What is this
They ateeeeee
You did that mom I’m in love 😻
Nicki is a Thee Titan of Rapoetry. Rap and poetry, because that's what she creates. Double entendre, innuendos and synchronously. She has it all!

Nikki and Ice yall did that. Keep ignoring the haters and get money and have fun. You live once enjoy life.
Best duo 🔥
I love when a new girl comes up and she’s like “I love Nicki Minaj she’s my influence” and then not long after Nicki collabs with them. It’s the cutest thing ever to see so much love and support being reciprocated between two women in an industry that tries to pit all women against each other!
These 2 killing it ❤🎉
Saweetie punching the air right now 😂
Ice spice really doin her big one 💯💕

Idk....i got to see how it sounds in the morning when I get in my car and turn my system up. Right now it's giving 6 outta 10
can't stop watching.
The fact that Nicki kept it cute on this song and allowed Ice Spice to shine, you can see that she really love her and wants ISIS to win. So lets get them Number 1 for the culture😘😘
i really hate youtube she has 25.5 million subs what's the point of having subs if they don't get notified at the same time a video drops .
BARBIEEEEEE
❤❤❤
😍😍
😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
I love how Nicki let ice spice shine 😍 cause we all know she would’ve went harder but she let ice take over which was cute and prefect 🙏🏾

I think Nikki is letting Ice Spice shine because she barely had any lines she basically let Ice Spice do her thang .You’ll say she’s using this girl no she’s schooling this young lady.She wants Spice to win in her career.

SLAYED QUEEN ❗️🩷
i was SO excited for this collab and feel like they playyeddd us. focused more on the vid then the lyrics and beat it's so repetitive. personally think if they featured pinkpanthress and replaced ice spice with coi larey the song would have been UNREAL. don't get me wrong i love love love ice spice but feel like they only featured her bc of her aesthetic and she's so popular nowadays. it isn't giving me the barbie fantasy i neededdd💅
She make ice eat this up so bad Love you queen ❤❤❤❤❤.
OH THIS IS GONNA BE SO FIRE
Two pornstars verbally farting into a microphone, pathetic
Nick Minaj isn't pregnant but she always delivers ❤️💯💫💫💫💫💫💫💫

"Ayy barbie Sabi ko na" still slaps
This song hits a lil too hard
The fact that Nicki came out in  the 2000’s and still sounds so fresh to date is amazing most artists from back then can’t  gravitate to this new sound of music that’s why they can’t make hits nowadays!
Nicki look so good the body is bodying...

Why is ice spice giving you close or like? Why are you guys using the same clothes in your videos Princess Diana you had on the outfit that you had on on the jet skis? That’s what I said

Zo Nicki is a 40 year old middle age woman who hangs with twenty something young females and plays with Barbies😅 oké noted 📝 I thought older people with younger females were creepy and weird guess it doesn’t apply on Ryan Gosling for playing Ken ( who looks old ) in the movies and Nicki Minaj in the music video😖
QUEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNN
Gruhhh Gruuh
We don’t talk enough about the visuals! The MV looks stunning and so pink, I love it!
This duo is everything 🤝😛

I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else on this track but these two
It’s Queen Barbie and Princess Barbie❤. Nicki I absolutely love you til my last heart beat.
Oh yes this is fire
15 years into her career and she’s still as relevant as if she just came out and the fact that she’s lifting up the girls that really want to be lifted…  QUEEN OF RAP NICKI MINAJ!
The duo Nicki & Ice is unrepeatable! They make history in women’s rap. I hope for more from them together❤

Only sounds good because of Aqua in the back. What rubbish are they even spitting
I wonder why the video doesn't have too many views, it's abnormal, every time Nicki Minaj releases a new clip or a new youtube song must always tamper with the Queen's views, it's not normal. all this so as not to make her win 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The Queen 👑👑👑👑

Good song, but too short 😢
Nicki really puts in so much hard work and sweat in whatsoever she does. NO wonder she turned down this song many times from different people. SHE had to make sure it was perfect enough and she put the right amount of BARBIE into it. I mean, the way she sits like a human doll at the beginning, talk about creativity💕💜💞💋🦄🦄
ATE DOWNN
YALL MF SNAAAAPPPPEDDDDD BABY 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

**sigh** The new girls nowdays just cant stand up to nicki's flow and style of rap. Ice is cute but her flow is monotoned and kinda boring, maybe as time goes on she'll develope a more distinct rap flow. Only person who comes really close is Meg aside from that Nicki just owns all of these songs.
Ok. This will be on repeat! It’s Barbie Biyatch!!! 💅🏿🦄
These comments fresh
Another Day,  Another Slay Periodttttt♥️💋💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼

Oh no 😢 minaj.. 👞 bad song 😔
Nicki has been THE Barbie for years so I’m disappointed that she collaborated with someone for the track. This is her moment and should’ve just been her. Plus this song is way too short. This should’ve been a huge moment and it feels like a deflated version of what she could’ve done. Ugh.
😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍

Life in plastic, its fantastic
MOTHERSS AND THEIR JOINT SLAY

Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice slayed with Barbie World! 💅🏽
They both could’ve went harder. Bars are not better than there last collab. Just 10x more catchy. Ice looks unreal literally stunning. Nicki ate bars, body, everything.
Listened to it 5 times already 🔥😭
The fact that this only has 100k views but 60k likes just proves to me hope downed y’all are
Love it 😍
I prefer the old school version the way it was . But that's just me. Nicki's songs that are her own are much better in my opinion.
Nicki is full circle and  leading her protégé ❤

I listened to the song multiple times and I gave it a honestly thumbs down because ice spice didn’t come with bars for real , I see why Nicki put it on her page because she came with all the weight 🔥 🔥🔥 to Nicki verse she carried it ,but ice spice could have came harder. Plus to short for all the hype. Iykyk

Que poca presencia escénica tiene Ice Spice 🤢🤢🤢🤢
So Hyped for the Movie!
Nicki minaj and Ice spice ate and left no crumbs OKAYYY!!
HE WANNA PLAY IN THE PLAYHOUSE
GYATTTTT
HEAVVYY ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE OUTFITS
....idk. Like the video was ICONIC as usual. But maybe I was hoping for a super bass moment? I mean "Barbie Girl" is so Iconic, I thought it'd be more pop like super bass if that makes sense? Also, I'm still not sold on Ice Spice. Like she sounds like BIA but not as good. There was just something missing i think.
It's day 9735, I've lost so many generations during this lifetime but  most of them were to this video
Never disappointed 💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💕💕💕💕
Nicki is the QUEEN!!! To be consistently putting out music and STILL on top after all these years!!! Stop playing with her! 👑
Why is it so short 😭

Did nicki lose weight?
Spices verse was the best!!!❤
It's barbie bi- if you still in doubt!! 🇨🇴
Trash
❤❤❤❤
I'm sorry, but no one cannot tell me that Ice Spice isn't improving.  Just from this song ALONE, Ice Spice is pushing that pen AND will continue on doing so. I'm actually glad that Nicki gave her that partnership deal, cause I know that's one of the reasons why Ice Spice is pushing her pen. And you can she wants to improve herself as an artist with her changing her flow, the wordplay and just about everything throughout the song.
These 2 are the most iconic female rap duo ever. 🤯❤️ Nicki Minaj is an OG & Ice Spice is the hottest rap girl out! They work so good together! This is definitely going to be a massive hit! Mark my words!
AGHHHH THIS IS SO GOOD
I loved it
If we can be honest any Nicki and IceSpice never fails to break the internet💯🐐🔥🎯
It's giving everything 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
More than a decade in the game and still holding it down ❤🎉

YES
The reason Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice are successful is cause their music is authentic. They built a loyal fanbase on consistency, and not being swayed into sounding like every artist. I pray one day my music can touch masses like Nicki Minaj & Ice Spice. But for now I’m just happy being a fan ⁴⁷
