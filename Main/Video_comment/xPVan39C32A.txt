Ødegaard with the ball is magicaaa
That's nice
We see togetherness in the Arsenal team now. It is going to be special campaign for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal Fans and the players.  5:49 5:51 loved the moment
How
Incredible performance from lads congrats
This is such good commentary even though they lost, respect.
It's actually a genius marketing from Southampton. Capitalizing on Arsenal fans for views 👌
Respect to bukayo shaka
Class team you 🤌❤️
That first goal from a counter attack was gold.
God this commentary duo is fucking hilarious.
Liverpool
I'm an Arsenal fan but kudos for Southampton for uploading this
The commentators are good quality.
First 15-20 minutes I was not happy. Southampton dominated us. After that we started to play
😂
hi
Never forget this ugly name: KLAUS SCHWAB ❗❗❗❗
The commentators are on 🔥 🔥
As a Arsenal fan. Love to see this as my recomended
Nathan Redmond with subscribe button in the end 😂
4:10 Martinelli gênio
2:00. Winning Eleven style goal
🤣
I have to say, these commentators are top class.
Breaking news Arsenal fan has hacked Southampton YouTube account 😂
Big Respect for this team <3
This is a better highlight reel than either Arsenal or CBS's.
Great highlight for our match with Southampton
The irony of Southampton bringing better highlights than Arsenal to an Arsenal win. Much respect!
Arsenal FC Indonesia
This Tomiyasu guy 🙌🏿🙌🏿
The Editor is a gunner fan

COYG??? What is meaning
Thankyou @Southampton for this highlight
Best highlights even it's from losing team.. Respect
mad respect for the commentator for keeping the hype even southampton is the losing team, keep up the good work #COYG
thank you
Much respect for Southampton for this 👏
I enjoyed this southampton highlight than Arsenal itself
come on the young Gunners
Respect to Southampton from a Gooner
Fully respect to Southampton FC, but Martinelli is somehow working for the role as ESR and he does it pretty good
How is playing out the ball all the way from the goalie be described as a sucker punch, a goal not deserved 😂😂😂
Shout out
Well fought. You were unlucky not to get the first goal. You'd probably had won if you did.
Mriip gaya mainnya ma city mungkin arteta dpat ilmu dri pep..
Southampton was doing great ,l don't know how they lost
I love the commentator ✨
No matter what happens a win a lost against any team u know there will an extended highlights fair play, all the best for the season saints
Nice
Thank you for the full video 🙏🙏🙏
As an Arsenal fan, I always liked southampton cause of how they are able to develop quality young talent every year. This is a tough loss but I know you all will bounce back! Stay strong!
fair play to the Saints editor who included the Ramsdale knee slide
The best Quality video
6:20 Saint's Commentator really brave calling out his employer or a slip of the tongue "Saints' lack of investment"
Great video quality guys🔥🔥
“With his gloves on the Brazilian”. Aren’t you old fossils tired of this tripe?
Thanks for this. Up the saints 👊
Respect from an Arsenal fan for the quality highlights Saints

Staunton City Council Unanimously Passed Resolution Condemning Forced Organ Harvesting The city council of Staunton unanimously passed a similar resolution on October 14, 2021, two weeks ahead of schedule. Mayor Andrea Oakes thanked local Falun Gong practitioners in her speech for educating the community about the issue. She said she had communicated with Virginia State Delegate John Avoli about the resolution. Mr. Avoli expressed his support for the resolution, as well as Vice Mayor Mark Robinson.  During the council meeting, the sponsor of the resolution, Councilwoman Carolyn Dull, spoke about how local residents should pay attention to forced organ harvesting in China and avoid unknowingly participating in this type of organ transplants. She thanked local practitioners for their effort. She believes that everyone should stand up and oppose China’s state-sponsored forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.

As an Arsenal fan, it is so soothing to watch long unbiased highlights from the losing team. #RESPECT
Excellent highlights video. Well done !
But why I see Arsenal Fans comment 😲
This goalkeeper outside starting 11
Arsenal won't give up on the championship ever
Your highlights are better than anyone else's really captured the ongoing of the match
โอ้โฮสุดยอดมากเลยเป็นการทำประที่สวยที่สุดของหลายฤดูกาลเลยลูกนี้ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นทีมเวิคไม่ว่าจะเป้นลูกยิงสวยงามทุกอย่างเลย
Without Aubameyang, Arsenal is strong team. They're played well and smooth that evening.
When the losing team releases better highlights than the winning team. Respect from an Arsenal Fan.
Right now Gabriel is the best defender in Premier league
Nice work
Been waiting for this, thank you for uploading the extended highlights.  Don't know much about Saints' lack of investment (6:22), but these commentators are definitely valuable assets of the club. Moreover, are they really allowed to, indirectly, talk about the ownership like that?
Southampton artıq  həyəcan  təbili  çalınmalıdır,ilk  hissənin  əvvələrində  qol  fürsətlərindən  istifadə  edə  bilmədikdən  sonra,sanki  həvəsdən  düşürsüz  və  ya yorulursuz.,məncə fiziki  və  mənəvi  hazırlıq  üzərində  çox  işləmək  lazımdır.
Southampton FC  4ever 🤟🤟🤟🫀🫀
Ben white over runs backwards its shit thats why everton scored its second
First 15 minutes, Southampton seems extremely dangerous but they need to be more lethal vs Arsenal. After that one goal, Arsenal got their form back, Southampton became sloppy. You cant do that in premiere league.
Shout out to southampton for making the 9min highlights even though they lost the game, hope you guys stay in the prem and climb the table
Thanks Sotton love The highlights
Most dissapointed performance so far this season for Saints.. the player looks no desire to win the game.. it's time to change the way we play, no progression in last 2-3 years.. we won't be in relegation battle all season.. 😢😢😢
I'm japanese.Tomiyasu and arsenal are the best！I love arsenal❤️
Thanks for the highlights
As an Arsenal fan, it is so soothing to watch long unbiased highlights from the losing team. #RESPECT
Class from the commentator
5:43 Laca's eyes . Btw, thanks for upload Southampton.
Nice highlight Saints!
BRAVO TOTTENHAM HOTSPURS
I see lots of my fellow Arsenal supporters came here to watch the highlights. I like the fact that the commentators are unbiased & give objective commentary of the game. From Nairobi, Kenya; I'm wishing you all a happy festive period & good times with friends & family.
Quality, commentary was awesome 👏🏽 👍🏽
Super Tom
Gabriels goal was his unborn baby... interesting celebration
Great highlights 👍✅
Thanks Saints for the longer version of the highlight despite the loss and the commentators were professional... You earn my respect #COYG 💪🏽
What a first goal!
Laca should be captain. The way he celebrated gabriel's goal
those commentators are class💯. No bias at all
Going by the in house commentary ..martinelli deserves special plaudits for giving the Saints right flank a torrid time.
First goal, good counter attack
weird the opposing team made better highlights and more detailed also
Arsenal fan from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪.the youngest team ever,,they are doing great job,, Aaron Ramsdale is best goalkeeper of the season
I hope you win all of your games❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
a deserved and fair result 👍🏻
Best channel for highlights
Well done Gunners Great quality highlights indeed
Good quality highlights
Im arsenal fans but i watch the highlight here cuz damn this is better
Insure about Caballero, doesnt look like a reliable goalkeeper.
Why does the Southampton channel have better highlights than the Arsenal channel???
“1-0 Arsenal and they hardly deserve it“ superb non bias commentary
Ditch the suit Ralph you ain’t fooling anyone.
play perraud
