Who is season 1 in battlefield 6?
This is literally the WORST map ever made in any video game ever made💯. Don't get me wrong, I love Battlefield but Exposure is horrible sick joke!!!
Its surprisingly Joseph May voices in here and also in division 2 and in seasons as well it amazes me.
Bu oyunda olmasa ne yapardık. bf ekibine teşekkürler.ama keşke bari lobiyi Türkçe yapsaydınız…
This is the best trailer they've ever made.. absolute hype..
Вообще-то, правильно ВКС России Дайсы
Huge fan of the map.

1 year passed, it has improved a lot. I love u dice
I dont really like Battlefield as a multiplayer game. But seeing everything and phases this game has been going especially season 4. I think I would see people say that "This was a great game" after 4 to 5 years. The way its implemented is not good tho. I wish they would have released it in a condition like season 4.
i will still never understand how that tank got in the facility
Please remove those cringy one liners after each match I hate it 😂
Maps are very bad with or without the update... Please dice, call back the BF3 and BF4 maps designers
Here is a new idea for vehicle update: the USMC ACV-30, MPF Griffen , Russian Terminator and Bumerang APC
the ending is perfection xD xD xD we know what you showed :D
Llevo desde battlefield 4 un modo dinosaurios
Bring back 128 player breakthrough
i pay for the battle pass if the game is free to play ...but for the moment nop..cuz imagine pay for the game and them pay for the battlepass
RIP 24/7 Exposure, it's an honour
Can't wait until Thursday season 2 let's go
Battlefield mobile?
Battlefield vietnam  in    portal plase  10/10
This season was great, enjoyed the battle pass and Exposure is the best map by far, it really breathed some life into the game. Excited to see what's coming for season 2!

For the love please add squad deathmatch and team deathmatch.

I'll never buy this or any EA game EVER again after an unfair ban on my BF5 account. Their investigation of the ban was a total scam.  Sodius_Maximus
Dead game,,lazy developer
Please bring back my beloved 😢  destruction 🙏 😢  and rebuilding in bf5 and bf1 and the grit in bf1
44к dislike 16 August 2022 12:00. DICE and EA my congratulations, you f****ed up money and community.
Stop taking crack, play BF2 for a few hours and contemplate how low you have fallen.
What's why i love Battlefield.
Just got a Ps5 to find out EA wants Another $65 for The Ps5 Version When I bought the PS4 version so $130 total they want for a game that wasn’t finished haha 😂 Pass! Wow keep up the slimy work.  Also they have taken out 128 so it’s less than the original game I bought that wasn’t finished.
Пожалуйста исправьте оптимизации !!
А можно мыльную картинку пофиксить в игре уже?!:)
Can't we just have the original BF4, remastered for current gen & without bugs?   I would pay good money for that. Not this.
I'm from BF4, I don't know what Battle Royale, Battle Pass and Fortnight mean!?
Man I remember playing this a lot, before it got blocked in Russia. Although this game was terrible, I enjoyed it. Like EA literally robbed me, I did everything, but they just blocked us.
bf1 had the best trailers
And that was 2 months ago when they cared about the game

BF3 BF4 Come back pleaaase 😢😢😢😢
When they first told us that the game was getting 4 seasons. It actually made me think that THIS time dice will actually have proper live service DLCs with like 3-4 maps per season. No More drip feeding.   But surprise surprise… Instead they made the WORST live service game they have ever made. Ar current pace we will be getting 4 maps in the games LIFETIME.    They seriously couldn’t have planned this from the start. Because even a good battlefield game like BF3  would get absolutely clowned if it gotthis little content.  And Lets not talk about the state of 2042 base game….
waiting for MW2
อยากให้มีภาษาไทยครับ
anticheat you greedy mofos
What did everyone ask for? Get rid of the specialists and add tons of weapons. What did you just drag in? A new specialist, only 2 more weapons, and a battle pass.  Wow, do you guys listen to the community at all?
Please go bankrupt and stop making games, you are just stealing peoples money.
Boo, this game sucks, wth have you done with this franchise?
fix your dame game dice
I really want you guys to make the main skyscrapers collapse in kaleidoscope 🙏
Hot garbage.
Bad game dead game who cares
I sadly say this but don't waste your money on this game it's not close to any previous BF game at all.
women🤮
the helicopters and osprey were already ruining the game and Dice has the genius idea to add another helicopter with a stealth mode so an invincible stealth helicopter, seriously Dice you are so pathetic.
Im here just to hit dislike 🤣🤣🤣🤣
just once I would love to be in the lobby that makes these trailers
Bad Company 2, remaster or remake it and add the Vietnam dlc to it too, id spend $50 for it no questions asked.
Add the peak aim pls
Ay can y’all remove Solomon Islands from the map rotations in pacific war that map is horrible   Matter fact can y’all just remove that map from the whole game

See free kills now.  Yes its obvious on servers.  The servers are set up on me giving you advantage with aim and spawning.  Not an IQ test to figure out lol.  YES WORLD REVOLVES AROUND ME.  Should see legal with Federal Govt.
I think I did pretty good leveling up going through this.  I had it worst than everyone else and still leveled up faster.
Going very slow at mastering the SWS.  Atleast I have one sniper rifle there.
We need scope crosshair DLC.  Call it Sport Rifle Crosshair DLC pack.  I was thinking of a circle center mass for scope crosshair BKS 8x.  For the first hold off make it a circle (its a ring for windage and elevation know what I mean?).  Use lines for same hold off for 8x crosshair not dots and take out the elevation line and windage line just use lines for hold off.  Easier to aim when they do that to server for instant headshots lol.  I dont need that but whatever.  I use the SWS I dont care for sniping really.
That’s great mate you have about 6 players left
I still don't understand why Lois Lane and Clark Kent isn't in it.
I found new BAG. I playid break thoght then I can't use vehicle. but My team player can use vehicle. What this? I play PS4
What we players want is simple 3rd generation single story 4th generation evolution battlefield 1st generation behemoth vehicle 2142's cool stuff from the future
Can I get my money back?
Pls Fix All Bug in Battlefield1
I’m not looking forward to these battle pass systems
Not this season, I'll wait.
Dice is so dumb they know fans on the majority scale don't want specialist and yet they keep on going as if they swan diving into their own grave.
Bots estupidos!
Now because of everyone praising the marketing guy, EA is gonna cut him and hire someone who can make trailers as bad as the game.

I hate EA because they have no idea how to make games! Are absolutely unscrupulous! They buy game developers and then let them die! Stomp in popular brands regardless of the fans! I hope EA will finally perish! EA almost managed to destroy the gaming market! The only thing that matters is money! Not the fan and not the staff!

As long as there are specialists in this game with "super skills" then I won't be going nowhere near it
It’s not the devs. It’s EA.
I'm excited for the BF3 realistic mod coming out 7 year development and it looks better than this.
Can we just get battlefront 3 please
Can't wait for Season 2 to drop in 2024!
Battlefield Beta forever
This is the worst bf ever made...
Will you guys do orbital 24/7 please
If you guys really want to save the Battlefield franchise i have a tip for you its called "Bad Company 3". But if you f*** this up no one will ever forgive you.
bf3 realitymod guys, lets go there ❤
Espectacular 😱👌
Now this is dope
Do Battlefield Mobile the weakest Android could still play a emulator of Battlefield 2 Modern Combat.
What did you do with the mode breakthrough in the latest update? Have you returned the original size of the cards, leaving 64 people? Did you try to play it yourself? Instead of adding maps from the portal to the breakthrough, you finally killed the mode by making it playable only for helicopters. Thank you.
The game is getting better Also love the new map
Im enjoying this game now but we need console only cross play. It's insane that this is even a request.
Battlefield Mobile please. Battlefield Mobile would be like returning to the PS2 and original Xbox and knocking the game out the park, with things like jet call inns in first person and M.O.A.B. With like 3 maps that are good for 6 Team Death match maps.
Im literally sitting here crying after watching the old Battlefield trailers. What happened to the franchise...
could have used that 90 dollars on weed
Loving so far
Anyone know what happen to battlefield portal
If the game launched like this       It still wouldn’t be remotely acceptable.
crazy
Need a Mobile Battlefield, like Modern Combat would be perfect for Mobile. Maybe thing like a first person jet staff run. It be great to go back to the era of Battlefield 2 Modern Combat and do new things with Mobile devices.
New pilot 👍
*bf2042 WanTander 💥👍*
What I want to say to the people who will buy BF2042 after watching this video... Of course, it's an ad, so you have to make it well, but don't forget that it's not real
0:56 2 Sundancers, that's what they should have shown at the reveal trailer.
現在ブレークスルーがマッチングしない状況が続いています。Q分隊やA分隊が量産されているようなので、せめてブレークスルーぐらいはいつでもやれるようにしてください
Can we get Battlefield Free2Play on Android Mobile and Nintendo Switch. That get you some serious money.
Dead game lol
Alte Karten würden echt auch wieder in das neue Battlefield gut ausschauen mehr Details und alte Karten ich liebe euch Battlefield community
ваша игра полная хуита
Personally I devise a compromise for anyone who wants classes AND to keep specialists.  Classes and specialists.  By going with classes, you’re limiting yourself with weapons and gadgets but you have access to a wider range of regular gadgets and can have 2 choosable gadgets. By going with specialists you can have any gun but you are limited to the gadget that the specialist has and a choosable one.  In order for this to work, however, we need so much more content to fill up classes. At least 10 primary guns per class 15 all round secondaries and a lot more gadgets.
Guys come on, everyone knows that this game had a bad launch, but tell me what battlefield hasnt. more content is always welcome, and i personally am so glad seeing grapple-able vehicles and the new vehicles.
when the season 1 content is better than the entire previous game( as in pre season)
Man, the old team already quit the company all it takes is for DICE to hire new amateurs to work on a new huge BF game that ended up disappointing the community miserably.
People will see the hours I’ve played and think im just crazy. Nah man, that’s the time i spent in the loading screen bc it doesn’t work. 💀💀💀
I think now I might get this game
Can someone help me out here when purchase game Ultimate edition game won’t let me get free session pass one it tell me was free when got on game told me to pay agin
how many bugs do you think this has?
More like... zero content.
I dont have a game, but trailer looks awesome :D
BATTLEFIELD SUCK.  I HATE THAT You ALL MADE ME HATE BATTLEFIELD, WHEN YOU RELEASED 2042.
You'd think you guys would realize that after the failure of this game that people still value single player experiences. However, you guys are still persistent on trying to force people into a multiplayer only future.  Normally I detest this company, but in this situation, this is just too sad and pitiful.

RIP BATTLEFIELD
I’m not holding any high hopes for this franchise anymore they ruined it
This looks good but hopefully is not all broken like when the game released I haven’t played for months but I be happy to give it another try I love battlefield way to much 😆
This battlefield is now very fun.
Dice dropped the ball man sad 😞
Mmmmmm nah still dead game.
Good job on wait to deploy can last 6 minutes but it actually last half 5 minutes and then you can play. and then you get kicked for being idle
Loooks funny hopefully the games a blast
I bought it two weeks ago in PS4 and I'm still playing bf4...
bruh got banned for no reason so im not even supporting theese guys.
just kill the project and work on an actual good bf game
This game is so dumb.
I wish I didn’t waste $60 on this piece of flaming garbage
1:24, How could this weapon fire faster?
I hate how its not free to play
Und noch immer ist bf5 und bf4 besser als dieser Müll... Hab mir extra ein Highend pc gekauft und dann bringen se diesen Müll raus... Das ist das erste BF welches ich nicht vorbestellt habe und es auch nie kaufen werde...
dead game lol
Seige of Shanghai + Damavandish looking Operation locker + Caspian border sections + Throw in some more classic battlefield bits = BF 2042 Season 1. I am not complaining though. This map reminded me of all those maps.
Map looks cool, but 1 map. 1. 1 single map. Also, specialists are still awful. Maybe I'll buy the next one if they make a game with maps like this, but only if there is way more content and traditional classes come back. I won't buy it with specialists no matter what
1:36 you even see its buggy in the trailer.... Come on its literally glitching all over the place and this is a trailer. like what??
I want my money back
Old classes. Now.
I wanted to wait for more content and fixes till I buy the game. Is this seriously the first map that will be added or have I missed something? Seems like the design team are real perfectionist taking their sweet time. Maybe that's a problem with more detailed games then ever before, balance is off, keep it simple and crank them maps out like hot cakes
I came back to this game!! iam not going lie its been fun hoping it gets better is the lobby or sever that takes a little time but once u in is game time!!! I miss battlefield 3
Imagine adding a battle pass to a game with no content smh
Uh, Dice...
It is telling that me a person that has spend over 800 hours in battlefield games over the last 12 years has only found out that a season 1 to BF2042 is coming from a meme almost 3 weeks after trailer came out Also am I the only one that feels like this is a mix of Dragon Valley and Hangar 21?
What a great trailer for a trash game
LFG!
Eh.
The marketing team knows more about what battlefield is than the developers
Zero Hours, like my playtime.
sandance AA is OP
Zero content🤨
looks nice
Why does every game have to do a battlepass? Is everything is Fortnite now?
If the devs were anything like the marketing team then this game would be amazing
❤💙
Dont fall in the trap again The trailer show a lot of action but only because they put everybody on the same point of the map  And they show only the fights
What's the difference between handling and accuracy? Is it the same, but different wording?
There’s gotta be wayyy more guns and stuff in this game for me to wanna come back to it
I want to love this game as much as i loved BFV, BF1 and BF4, but i just cant vibe with the whole clone wars thing, i think it it just plain dumb seeing a bunch of clones killing eachother
30 usd for buy pass 👎 why not 10 usd
an incredible video
AA missile launcher needs a buff. It takes 4 shot to take down a helicopter and the flair have a fast cool down. After popping the flairs there's still a 15-20 sec before you can lock in again, By that time the helicopter have done the damage and left the scene to come back for a second round.
12.000 Steam players XDDD   payday 2 have more players
Still can’t choose what server you want to play 🤣🤣🤣
Too little, too late!  The game is completely broken. I gave it a lot of tries but always quit within the first minutes of playing it.  ok, i realise that writing down the problems would take me hours to write. It is better to tell you what I like about 2042: ......... NOTHING..... and the game is out so long. It is still years from being finished and becoming a good game.  WE GOT SCAMMED BY EA AND DICE
One new map and only two new WEAPONS? Oh! F**k you DICE
Zero content 😂 one map and 2 weapons after eight months
128 player lobby back!!!!!!!!👍👍👍👍
Basura de  juego que decepción total 👎👎👎👎
8 months late, game is dead, lets get a battle pass
So now we have to wait like another 6-7 for a new map?:)) Omfg can't wait. I don't get it. Is just one person working on this game?
I'm very impressed with the new map. High level of verticality really make the map feels special, But what I'm not impressed with is that this takes 8 months to roll out just 1 map, 2 weapons and 2 helicopter.  Although this have taken a lot longer than it should be. I'm very glad that DICE is making a recovery and taking notes from previous mistakes this time. Keep it up like this and We'll get a actually decent game.
Just bought the game for $30 today, so let's see how well it plays on PS4 vs BF5.
map is kind of great, but that landslide part would have made for a fantastic levolution event on the map
I'm still hopeful about the game gets better like star wars battlefront 2
La comunida veterana de Battlefield Necesitamos mas contenido y que no se haga lineal el juego pongan los mapas de portal en el principal mas coberturas mas destruccion en el campo y que los mapas No sean tan grandes ,tienen que reducirlos  deberian en los escuadrones No repetir especialistas o eliminarlos VENGA PUEDE SER EL MEJOR JUEGO TIENE POTENCIAL NO LO DEJEN MORIR   A PESAR DE TODO BATTLEFIELD ES DE MIS FAVORITOS PERO LOS OTROS JEJEJE XD ANIMO BANDA SE PUEDE MEJORAR.
trailer music "  Position Music - Mission Zero  "
Nice video..but not many players available for matchmaking. Such a waste of money!

0:49 how tf tank inside the building
after playing battlefield as one of my main games since bad company 2, i can confidently say this franchise is but a mere shell of its former glory and this over hyped under delivered drop is just further proof that our game is never coming back. You released 1 new gun, 1 new crossbow, 1 new specialist with a rocket from BF4, and 2 helicopters that MOST PLAYERS CANT EVEN USE. The game is 64v64 and 32v32 and we have 1 attack chopper per team??? is it that youre afraid to let people have fun or you just cant code the game well enough to handle it?
Zero Hour: A perfect term to describe how long anyone with IRL friends and livelihoods played any of FromSoftware games.
crossplay ruins this game. was fun playing with crossplay off for the first 2 weeks of the season but now nobody is playing, forced against pc players. NOT FUN!
This game blows and I will never preorder from this franchise ever again
beautiful map.
12.000 Steam players online now..wow😅😅
Dice i have faith in you to restore this game but if you can’t then many will be disappointed because you stopped updating battlefront 2 in order to make this game and it flopped. Some things you can do is instead of one map a season and 2 guns and the same helicopter twice do 2 or 3 maps and 3 or 4 guns and it’s 2042 so you can think of some good vehicles. I don’t want this game to be in ashes before we even reach a year of it being out. After enjoying battlefield for almost 11 years because of my brother I don’t want to see this game lose more faith in EA.
Oh yay, a mere what 7 MONTHS LATER, we get 1 new map, Specialist, vehicle. Sorry but no thank you.
Bring back BF3 developers for the next one if you want to actually sell the game and have people be satisfied
I am a old BF fan ( you can check channel) and i think BF4 is the best shooter game ever, all said this game is a disappointment and i knew it from the trailer, never played 1 hour of the game and never will, that’s how it should be.
Good game
Please.please stop c5drone. I feel very sad. Because it don't have  skill and good feel.Please stop.please
map is actually good... just needed to launch with a lot more content with this first season
This mf trashcan is the reason we don’t get sw bf 3
Not blaming the devs, probably huge mismanagement led to all the disappointments in the first place. I guess now we are headed in the right direction. Although it took them a year to put something up what is somewhat decent, I still think it’s better than anything else they released.   Continue the direction, listen to the community and deliver high quality. If this quality would have been there on day 1, the game would have been fun.
No gloom no fun
戰地已死
Amazing
in case you wondering, like : dislike count is 25k : 41k
Why should I bother playing your game that you can't be bothered to optimise properly I play better looking titles than this that look and run better so why is it I'm getting inconsistent frames of 60- 70 on a 3070 8gb? It's crazy can literally run anything at great settings and get consistent frames but it's ok this game has lack of content lack of fun and lack of replay ability but it just baffles how past titles where better optimised for gpu and cpu utilisation. It's like their trying to pull a cry tech
Been trying to play but I can’t find any lobby’s without AI or just end up waiting 3/128 people. Am I selecting the wrong servers or is there just no one playing?
Why is there not a VR version of this? I’m done with traditional games after contractors came out.
Боже какая дрисня.😂
I'll see you guys back here for season 2 in 2023
I always knew this game would have a future, One thing I am thankful for is the perfomance increase my game is alot more stable on my ps4
I hate how they set up the scene as if everyone will be together like this. These maps are too big for any cool stuff like these fake moments shown in these trailers.
the one map they did release was really good and felt like and actuall war torn battlefield map but we literally got like 2 or 3 new weapons 1 map and thats it a paywall battlepass they brought me back to play maybe a couple hours but nothimg grind worthy like battlefield 4 or bad company

put this game free in the game pass and MAYBE I play it
GET A HINT EA AND DICE!!!!
one map? this is a joke right?
Get yo goofy ahh outta here, bf ain't how it was like before
At least they removed the cringe voicelines at the end... Which is nice...
I disliked every single BF2042 video on this channel. I wish I could do more to voice my dissatisfaction because the leading devs for bf2042 destroyed something I really enjoyed.
i whan't my money back... 99€...
it is called zero hour because zero people are playing or even interested to see if you can make this work anymore
They make these trailers look so fun and extreme. Then you get in a match and it’s totally opposite.
Haha 😂 25K people liked this video. Dice has that many employees?
1週間経ったけど100万再生いってない 悲しいけどbfに誰も興味無いって分かってしまう あの頃の勢いがないのは寂しいな
Fortunately for them, the map actually plays how it looks in the trailer. Now fix the rest of the game
Battlefield 4 had more content then this.
The map is pretty decent. Both close and long range combat. I personally don’t have a dislike for the game. I appreciate the older style of gameplay
Played it yesterday after months and had a lot of fun on the map.
Garbage 👎
No more specialists, give us back our classes!
How do they even have the nerve to release this the game is dead they should just forget about it and move on because there adding fuel to the fire
You know, it doesn't look half bad. The map resembles a lot of the final stand maps which were alright I guess? I hope this is the first step of many in improving the game.
sell the company and IP to developers who are actually competent
Bravo to the team who made this reveal vid 🤝
You guys should learn from warzone! They bring so much content within a relatively short time to keep players at the game. It feels as if you guys are years behind in marketing, development and understanding the fanbase. Insane how little content you bring and keep disrespecting your fans.
Impressive example of how 1-3 executives are able to ruin work of 500+ people.
After playing this map for the past few days it’s safe to say it’s one of the best in the bf series ngl
lets go
Please bring Battlefield mobile... Conquest 8v8 10v10 16v16 and 20v20 😍😍🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
ONE MAP?
Espero que se recuperen, han hecho buenos juegos como battlefield 4 las cosas mas pequeñas son las que mas importan
One map ?
This game is amazing!
Where did you even find enough players to make this trailer?
Dead game
We want mobile battlefield 😭
Dead game lol
6 months worth of work for this LOL still poorly optimized and has open spaces bigger than sahara desert, refunds when?
This makes me sad.
no youtube é uma belaza , agora o jogo online , gastei dinheiro atoa , bt1,bf3,bf4bfv são os melhores .. o 20242 é horrivel
Ummmm......I'm still going to continue playing BF1!!!!
Nobody cares about this dead game anymore 😂
🤣😂🤣
Dice you should’ve listened to the players no matter what…
やっと普通のゲームになった
I'm enjoying the game
Remake operation metro et locker please 🤣
to be honest this map is actually fun to play and i can understand (from a devs point) than specalists cant be removed since they are in the codebase and would need a total reprogramming of the game (this is EAs fault NOT Dices since they have to follow what the big money givers tell them to do) but now to save the game like BF4 / BF5 they need to do a few things: More good maps wich are not that open  anonymous skin options for the specialists so that they look like the other random grunts (as option) still rebalancing of some weapons/helis. And more Weapons/Gadgets and Vehincles. All in all More good content.
And again more open spaces/vehicles. Oooh cant wait.
People still play this? I bought the game, and maybe played it for 15 hours total. Its trash. Wont be buying the next battlefield on launch.... First they stop developing Battlefield V because they couldn't get anything right, and then they release this pile of hot garbage... I used to be a diehard Battlefield fan, but now i don't even trust they can make a game worth turning on.
За постоянное уничтожения русской техники диз, только в играх и можете 😏
if this game get somehow the exact same redemption story like battlefront II maybe i will give a second chance
40k dislikes GIGA OOF
Specialists makes me sick
Its sad this franchise went out like this...
the audacity of even using the term "Season 1".
I downloaded it again and gave it a blast, got annoyed at the “stealth” chopper and deleted it again. Gun play is good but everything else is bad.
Three thumbs DOWN

I can whip up this map in UE5 in 7 days. How can this take them 8 months?
Whoever edited this, did you no favours.
1 massive map……. They could of made 6 team death matches - 6 catch the flag… 6 squad matches…    From this mega map…… but no.    They made 1 feking map..
Traded in this game months ago 😄 maybe this update should of came a little earlier 🤦🏻
20 év Battlefield játék után ez a szar ingyen se kéne.
Hope next battlefield Will be a battlefield 1 part 2 or a battlefield WW2 Normandy DDay..so that way 42 will be in my rearview mirror
Make the game free to play.
Great map. Great update.
Stop preorderering games.
Kinda sad instead of fixing your game you add a battlepass for the big update
Battlefield without destruction is no more Battlefield!
Ngl I forgot this game released
Worst game ever
But why does it look better here in the trailer then when I actually play it. 🤦🏻‍♂️
They have really over complicated this game beyond belief. It's just silly at this point.
flying suit bad idea
They done pulled together every single person who plays this game to make this trailer!
I can see they’re listening to everyone’s feedback regarding the specialist.
I keep asking over and over how did Battlefield came to a point like this. EA must be sold to someone more capable and willing to take the franchise back to it's trails.
lol
Looking forward to the new content and at least EA & DICE are making the game better after its horrible launch. Hopefully they will try to continue fixing this game. Time will tell the tale.
Na not fooling me this time 👎🏽
People still play this game? Lol
Ao invés de lançarem o jogo passe de batalha etc…vocês deveriam lançar um filme do BF  CERTEZA QUE  SERIA UM ÓTIMO FILME
Specialist suck. Also go back to Battlefield 4 type rent a server.
Cool one map…  It kinda pointless to have a stealth helicopter that still get blown up away by 10 or 20 player choose the new specialist of rocket launcher
One map??? One map?
How can we play when theirs no one in the server. Just BOTS, last time I logged on I waited 1 hour to even play a match with half of them bots. Wish we all could get our money back !
demorou mais saiu, parabéns incompetentes! paguei 300 R$ pra esperar esse tempo todo pra vocês fazer algo novo no game, que falta de compromisso com o cliente!
Bf4 still better
Isnt like a new gaming coming out soon?
Sick map. I’m down
Hahahahaha   this looks the opposite of good
Wack
Season 1 started in a game that I have to put everything on low to get it to a playable level using 3090! What a joke!
agm fing sucks please increase the splash damage
season ZERO content
It's insane 🤎 My favorite so far 😁
Mw2 is comming soob
The title is so ironic
Notice how the helicopter isn't actually killing anyone it shoots
No news bout 2042 can be that great
The Game is beginning to make fun again. But i dont like the spacialists. But more importent for me, i miss a the hardcore servers in the other modes than portal. Maybe it will be possible to create his own spzialist?
You should make the bsvm once in single fire mode stronger
look i get it everybodys all like “tO lAtE” but this is really good and enjoyable this is a HUGE step and i can see why its been dry cause theyve been working on this huge update. idrc what ppl say this has given me hope for the game and its actually fun now. thank you bf for listening and turning this around. it may have taken a long time but im still happy with this.
They’re really bold to be asking for more money
Who is Ivan? And why we need to leave him to home?
@Battlefield   You know that the T28 is an 2WW Tank.   Why you changed it from the T 14. Just that we have to do all the Upgrades again?  And you say that you cant change these idiotic Specialists. Just make a ,,normal Soldier Skin`` for them.
❤❤
👏👏👏
🔥🔥🔥
Nice trailer. But still doesn't beat previous battlefields. Enlisted is my new battlefield. Lol.
I still want my money back
keep dreaming dice, your game is dead
Overall the game is absolutely amazing, however the launch was a huge disappointment. I hope zero hour has a chance to revive the game.
Awful. A Crossbow. A Friggin' SMOKE Grenade Launcher (Really? After the grenade and the rifle adapter?). And a specialist that's literally required for infantry to combat helicopters. 100/100 for completely killing my mood to log in and play.
Make the crossbow a secondary
i have to admit that the map looks beatifull
wait, the crossbow from bf3 is returning?
If only game play was actually like that
Need skins for people no specialists or make the specialists outfits good and not trash
Dislike is on 39K BTW
Imagine this Game free and only play for custom things
The map is really good, even for battlefield standards, but one map and a couple of guns aren't enough to keep us engaged for long.
soundtrack is soo good
Now I can’t even use an air vehicle. Just ONE per team? REAL NICE
I still want my money back
Can‘t get the new wapon. Rang over 29 but still unlocked. More maps please.
why is this not fluid ? The framerate isn't even smooth  Nothing looks realistic
2022: this game suck 2042: i miss 2042
Not gonna lie, that looked amazing
Battlefield 2042 Exposure 1to1 copied from Battlefield 1 Monte grappa overhauled for 6 months is very identical... Exposure vs Monte grappa this is how you can also community kidding Respect... DICE
Name sound?
Dice I promise you the only way you could save face right now is to offer refunds. If you do not the next battlefield game will fail. No matter how good it is gamers will remember how you lied to us. The franchise will die.
how wasn’t i aware of this
why i always have to join ending games over and over again?
Zero Hours is exactly how many I wish I’ve played of this game
👍
cant wait to see new bugs
Awesome video
It's alot better and a decent map hope to get more great maps like this in future
Just me or did a part of the map look like the centre point on boarder from bf4
Хуйня, переделывайте
What happened to Breakthrough we only get 3 maps now or what. DISCARDED HOURGLASS AND EXPOSURE. This sucks.
WOW!
Beta is over guys. lol
If dice is good at something then that's making great trailers.
эта поделка не стоит вашего времени
Wooooow it’s amazing 🤩
What is this, Fornite ? 🥱🥱🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤣😂. Too late EA, too Late and told still bad. Let this Game R.I.P.
This actually looks like a step in the right direction! I hope development isn't dropped early
Good game
For god sake i would buy this game if there's classes
com esse trailer me deu vontade de jogar o BF4
I think you redeemed itself, I’m back playing
Can’t wait for MW2 to come out so all these objective camping, one man army wannabe Rambo’s go hop on Price’s D$&@.  Please make a hardcore mode or let people get weapon unlocks and xp in portal.. oh and put f$&@ game chat in it. Make it to were you can kick worthless people from your squad.
At this point they should make a bf3/bf4 remaster. Nothing changed to the game, just updated performance and graphics. And if they choose to add cosmetics, who cares. You're not forced to buy them.
Just make a conquest free to play.
Zero hour: the average time it takes for someone who bought this game to regret it
Please create a new game in the style of Battlefield 4 with the same mechanics. say that an old bf4 game has more free skin and weapon and mission and task, than a new game. why not use the same engine and improve the graphics and create a new history and new map etc. that will be so more easy to make a new good game like that...
Bro waited a whole year almost just for 2 new weapons, a battle pass, and a new map. Wow
Expected nothing, still disappointed!
I rocketed a chopper from parachute, sniped out the pilot, landed on it in mid air, and flew it to get 5 kills. Great map, great experience :D . Just like old times
remake a battlefield 4 and get some money back from everything you spent in vain and losing fans of the saga.
I can't stop playing now lol
Great fun well done .
будет карта Донбасс?
The game failed, failed, failed, if you canceled its development and turned to a modern war on Battlefield 6, it would have been better for you,,
Idk why but the graphics are soulless compared to previous titles
I LOVE IT😍
Ghostmakter R10  Weapon is the biggest scam ever.
Overall the game is absolutely amazing, however the launch was a huge disappointment. I hope zero hour has a chance to revive the game.
Why battle pass🤦🏽‍♂️
Just give us our money back
Little reminder. 38k dislikes on this video, please insert here meme with CJ
I feel like y’all are a little bit whiny. Like a bunch of spoiled kids 🤷🏻‍♂️
I still don't understand the system requirements... I mean yeah, this game looks decent, but considering how heavy the system requirements are, I really don't get it. It doesn't look that good...
Expected the unexpected. Realised that disappointment is the unexpected.
I mean its playable now and acually fun to play!   this gives me bf1 vibezz   love to all dice members!
stop.... stop.... its already dead
I will check out this update but tbh when mw2 comes out this will get buried and I will definitely be playing that instead   bro
Colourful happy time game hero nothing. What a bunch of nothing you created?
Modern Warfare 2 is coming EA, you lose.
Unfortunately I've stopped playing 2042 😒🙄
Zero Hours, the amount of time I’m putting into this
Oh boy! Can’t wait to play only 1 single map with 1 new specialist after almost a year without much content!
Marketing team: A+ Devs / EA for releasing this game a year and a half too early: F Company: C-
Map fire!
Haceis mejores videos que videojuegos.... valla estafa no vuelvo a comprar nada de vuestra empresa 😒
No no no. You won't fool me again BF! I know your little tricks now......
If the player count is enough for the matchmaking to work I’ll download it back
So, my experiemce after sinking several hours into this map today. Not bad. Lots of fun, but it seems people get a bit to cluster happy. Sundance and anyone running a rocket launcher have a field day with players. Got like 12 people with one cluster earlier today. Not a map problem, tbh. A people problem. Looking forward to seeing what else comes for this game. Please don't abandon it like with BFV.
Thank you very much dice I love the game & now it so much better & fun too play & I love you guys at dice & the game is on the right track now keep up the good work 👏 & let's see you on the battlefield. I love the new lightning effects & the Stroms are much more awesome I love it guys.
For those who can't see the dislike, let me told you. This garbage BF trailer has 37K dislikes vs only 24k likes.
I love bf2042 and season 1 i nevery said no i like said yes i love to level up keeps me going  because every time you level up pushes you hard more rags xps this what im doing kills i this map keep you going
Season 1... and no more
More efforts gone into the trailer then they put into the whole game
More than half a year and they release 1 map, 1 specialist, and a couple guns. They've lost a lot of respect, can't wait till they pull the plug on this before the end of the summer lol
"All hands on deck from 6 studios!" And we get 1 gun 1 map and 2 gadgets in 8 months. Where's the refunds for the fraud MOTHERFUCKERS???
Not bad. Not nearly enough to get me back to it though.
I bet this trailer wouldn't even run in the game.
I hope this map has cover for foot soldiers
After 7 months we finally get an update
Dice who did you make this season for the 7 people playing the game in your studio testing the game?
😯😯😯
If this was BF3 or BF4 there would've been 8 maps out by now. DICE really lost their touch
I’m pretty sure there was more effort put into this trailer than the actual game.   Can we get our refunds now?
Patetico, nos habeis timado con este juego, no teneis verguenza ninguna !!!
most overhated game ever
So utterly desensitized by BF trailers. Happy to see we’re out of beta tho.
it annoys me tht the hate this game gets
So sad to see how well ea knows the playerbase judging by this trailer, and yet they deliver us a broken game and way to little content this far in. And a crossbow? Come on! Almost insulting when a common complaint is that the game lacks proper guns. Nope, ill wait till you got more to show!
Me and the rest of the world must be playing different games… I like it :(
you guys should have worked on 2143, instead of 2042 expansions. this game is dead. 2142 still lives in the hearts of many.
Still not buying this game
The game is finally playable with a controller, i play on pc.
zero hour? its that reference to how much time it would take to go through  all the content added ?
BF1 looks infinitely better than this.
Lmfaoooooo let it die guys, let it die
New weapons LMFAO. ok bf3 bf4
The trailer guy are the only one carrying this game.
I need go back to Battlefield Bad Company 2
Can't play. Can't load into games anymore. Just get kicked to the menu with no notification errors. So yeah. Not worth it.
Season 1 already ? LMFAO !
Wow polish Grom Ewelina <3
This trailer 1:33 - 1:35  nice scream ,  But Battlefield 5 DLC Pacific war 2:38 - 2:40 same scream ?
I’m surprised that they’re still pursuing this game
Looking good
honestly i liked the game since day 1 despite all the mass haters and will enjoy season 1. if yall dont like it move on let us that do enjoy the game enjoy it in peace yall arent needed here if yall hate it so much move on stop being pathetic
How did 23k like this only maybe 1000 are playing the game rn?
sadness ahead
Nice trailer, but that's it. I still not able to get my refund back
Pls fix it
Well at least you guys tried with the trailer I wish you all try it with the actual game
I’m gonna be honest I see a lot of people hating on this update and don’t get me wrong there could be a lot more but this map is amazingly fun in my opinion my only complaint is there is still so many missing guns we should have take battlefield 4 for instance it’s loaded with so many options then you have 2042 this game has potential but god it needs content
The new map is fun tbh shame its just gonna get trashed on for the sake of it
Destruction? Gritty solider Look? World war Feeling?
They spent more time making these trailers than ACTUALLY working on the game itself. No just no for paying 10dollars for premium when the game is barely pushing beta quality.
Just stop. Y’all literally killed BF
i wonder how the dislike bar looks like.
If they add campaign to this game, it would shine like bf4
I found a bug the inside view of car if we like drive the person going up and the body block the view
I enjoy the trailer more
Adds more rocket launchers and reduces playable amount of helicopters? 🤔 if getting bombarded by rockets in a helicopter wasn't bad enough.... just got a whole lot worse when there's less targets in the sky and more equipment to take em out with....
never seen such a bad game and I've been playing since 1994 , already disinstalled , i tryed new operator and then see ya , trash game
はよPSプラス買ってやりたい
A little to late plus u release a BattlePass on a game u charging people on.
Having 100 people running around with TV missiles is NOT FUN dice
Took long enough
interesting
Nice trailer, wished the game was actually as good as this fake news trailer is portraying it to be.   Sad.
if this gets boycott, the devs will wake up.
I used to play bf3 bf4 and now cos free bf1 on ps5. Does this bf2042 is really that bad?
We need MORE vehicles though... It's  RIDICULOUS we only have 1/2 tanks each team 128 PLAYERS...  I had more vehicles playing Armored Kill Dlc in a freaking ps3
От игры остались только трейлеры красивые, а играет 1000 человек со всей планеты. Опять трансгендера добавили?
The game up until this point has been a disaster. After the #1.0.0 update the game is actually really nice, this is what it should’ve been on launch. Now the thing that’s missing is content.  I played the map and it’s really good. Hope we can get much more from the other seasons and not just the bare minimum of what was promised.
WOW ! This five dudes who still playing will love it.
Zero content should have called this update. 1 map 1 weapon no gadgets . Very sad
this map actually good
waiting for players 4/64…. zero content, zero passion, zero creativity and zero players… great job guys, you really nailed it!
It'll be their first and final season
Finally. I played and the game really changes from november. Now it's really better and really more content.
Too little, too late...
Nobody cares.
When they/them sells you a game. Enjoying that diversity yet?
Zero Content 😢 💔
Fool us once...
lmao 8 months for 1 map a few weapons and a new character who's awesome original new gadget is just another launcher that would have just been part of the engineer class. Also this was all stuff supposedly planned before release right? The dev cycle to get content into this game must be some sort of nightmare. BF3, 4 and 1 all managed so much more new content in such a shorter period of time. Never thought I'd miss premium.
In one ear and out the other.  Fix ya goddam movement you shouldn't be able to run full blast with a lmg.  Make maps smaller and add more score to conquest games so they go faster and have more action.
Hey check it out, still not battlefield.
still a failed abortion of a game. Meanwhile MW2 looking hot af.
As soon as I saw they announced a battlepass that's when I decided I'm officially done.
*RATIO'D*
Played it waste of time
Battlefield: Zero Players
Had fun with the update, it’s not much considering we waited 8 months but it’s better than nothing. New map plays surprisingly well compared to other walking simulators
Should always be a free next gen upgrade  after selling me the garbage I have to pay for again
This is probably what the game would look like if EA cared about anything besides money
They murdered a game with so much potential,  BF used to be my fav games to play and now I cant stand it
Too little too late. This game is beyond dead.
Still waiting for the new map called "Refund" 😂
If only the game was as good as the trailer😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 I don’t have one ounce of trust in this game guys neither should you
Remboursez nous, bande de voleur.
bah
I’m SUPER excited
Though this is too little too late, I still think it is fun to play overall, and instead of just being grumpy about it imma just play it now and again until it completely dies out.
Гауно
There must be stand below: "Not the actual game."
These hi-tech effects (e.g. hit marks) are anti-militaristic. I don't like them.
this is better than battlefield 4!!!!👍👍
great trailer. still not enough content
So whatever happened to portal? You guys killed that game mode too?
Polska Gurom!!!
Trailers are deceptive leads to heresy
new map is genius
False advertising
make the flashlight a side attachment instead of it replacing my grip 🙄
I hate your Game, i Love Bf but this Maps are so Trash :/
Battlefield 2042: Zero Players
It's a shame they didn't remove the specialists
Ich gebe nie wieder Geld für Battlefield aus , für keins eurer spiele . Was habt ihr geschafft ? Nix überhaupt nix . Hauptsache das Geld kassiert .
9 mois d'attende pour sortir 1 map
Good , DICE NICE gameplay 👍
this game is morbed...
it is. This update is absolutely legendary! the game is fun!
Please , bring the BF1 graphic quality back!
The least you can do is make this "game" free to play and respect the community that trusted so much in the game's development. REFUND!
What a JOKE 🤮 . They gonna drop support for this game soon just like with BFV.
Zzz
Anyoe still playing? ..........silence lol
一張地圖 兩台直升機 跟一個專家  你還是做艱難的決定吧  浪費我的1780
I'll wait untill I get it for 5 bucks. :D
23k likes and 36k dislikes. Dislikes are like 60% more than likes lol. I still have faith in the game.
Даже тут умудрились обдристаться ...мдааа , когда то студии под крылом EA делали отличные игры. Что случилось ?
After 6 monthes, we finally get 2 guns and 2 vehicles and 1 map...
I just want a military sandbox shooter like previous titles. Grappling onto a jet and destroy it with a crossbow midair is a littler too much. Only reason the randazook works is because not everyone can pull it off.. this game literally trying so hard to force “only in battlefield” moments into gameplay.
i don't trust you guys anymore
"Zero hour" is the amount of hour that I'm going to waste with this game.
What bothers me the most is that the maps are so bland, look at how detailed, full of character and life the maps are in BF1, there was really a sense of a great scale war. BF2042 completely lacks that element. And the specialists simply DO NOT FIT in a battlefield game. This is not overwatch, they`ve messed with battlefield true identity of that random soldier on the battlefield.
So bad, those massive likes are literally bought with bots.
Hora zero: zero gameplay
Can’t even play the game. I want to but can’t get past the errors
Bugsfield 2042 Season 1:  Zero servers
For me it is Zero Hour because on Xbox I can't even get a game as all I can see is 'WAITING FOR PLAYERS...'. On the day of new content this game is dead for people who are not using the crossplay option.   There is so few Xbox players on 2042 and it is the only BATTLEFIELD game with crossplay, and yet I can still get a game on any previous BATTLEFIELD game, lol even an Xbox Live Arcade (Xbox 360) game BATTLEFIELD 1943 has more players than 2042 has.
I Love this, all the nice Login Errors. Seems they hold Up for themself being unable to Show working stuff. Gg Dice
Will the items stay forever? That is, a technician, a specialist, and so on?
Best Battlefield game hands down keep up the amazing content
I want my money back and no one at EA is responding. I’m filing a complaint
...Meh... Seems very little...
1 map and 2 guns, after 9 mounts, really dice?
They just released it and the servers are down, you could play one match and its down again😂😂😂
What skin at 0:34 ?
btf 2042 bug  600p:13c  i love you  !:p    bug game  hahahahahaha
THIS GAME IS TRASH
Content that was supposed to release 6 months ago btw
Can not start A game wow
Really? 1 map 2 weapons and a specialist? ow and of course advertised 128 player gamemodes are going to garbage can? I played bf2, bf3, bf4 and now 2042 is the last one... Dissapointed and i really regret buying this game
сделали бы игру такую изначально! она была бы популярная
They learned nothing..
Ngl. This trailer is exciting. Actually playing the game? Not so much.
First day Playing Season 1 = unable to enter the game while writing this | several hours have passed since the release of season 1
CAN NOT START YOUR GAME 😡Battlefield error code 600p 13c
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
Hang on ... at 1:06 there's no hitreg.  This trailer is pure fantasy.  Their depiction of air vehicles not just hovering beyond AA max lock range is particularly laughable.
How pathetic is it that their are rumors in the BF community that dice is already abandoning ship on the game to make the next installment. Like do y’all idiots not realize that this garbage game will be the last Bf game most players purchase? Like maybe actually try and redeem yourselves.
Can’t even connect lol
船と地球見るために買ったわけじゃねぇんだわ。
Persistant data not loading xbox series x. Still Can’t play the game 6 months after purchase.
battelfield  5 love
Goosebumps when he ziplined on the jet ! Sheeeesh this game is gonna be much better now , finally season is starting
Para sacar un pase de batalla después de meses  y cuando es  la hora de inicio de pase de batallla que te dé CÓDIGO DE ERROR , y no podamos probarlo ni ha primera hora de salida es una vergüenza, para mi battelfield me a quitado la esperanza que tenia el amor hacia la franquicia y sobre todo el RESPETO Y LA ILUSIÓN, habéis hecho de una saga bestial, una BASURA haya y os metáis por donde quepa nuestro DINERO PANDA DE RTAS
ERROR 15:702P:13C IS REALLY?
10 months of 'work' and we get 1 map and 2 guns. EA you are trash.
Zero hour will be the amount of time i will spend my time playing this game..
Absolut enttäuscht vom Spiel! Ein Spiel was gar nicht fertig ist  Zero hour =Zero content
Как купить в ориджине в России подскажите
I may jump back in this game! Looks great!
Late and poor containment
return the money and close this garbage
dead game
Battlefield 2042: Zero Content
After 7 Months of doing nothing...they give us ONE new Map. Its like they dont want you to play this game 😆
Hey guess what. We still don't like specialists
BattleFart 2042 , give Back my  money !
For god sake, please just be as good as the trailer, unlike last time
No i to jest gra oby tak dalej 💪🏼
Domination?
Thats what i call battlefield. The trailer game, not the actual game.
Well maybe until 2042 they will fix this game..... Maybe
How many people are actually working on this dumpsterfire that all they were able to create over the span of 8 months is this? Do any of the people over there even realize how much money this is costing them? How many people are so absolutely furious and will not buy their next game or any paid content? after the BF5 fiasko this was your last chance of turning the wheel around DICE and you absolutely failed. So long Battlefield.
载具狗的末日 = The end of the vehicle dogs
Can I have to feedback to battlefield ? When you gonna give those US and Russia classes return as playable? are there factions between nopats and Ronin that you add some? I think that my opinion that need improvement. Is there Oz as specialist, a member of Ronin? It should be Ronins is on the Russia side. The specialist has too much same characters, it should be at least on limited.
It's still June 9. And I still can't play. I just tried to find any lobby - there are 16 people online in the world right now (on console).
Hello plz subscribe
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This give me old bf feelings
Very good
Oh a new specialist?! Pass.
only game on earth where even the REVEAL TRAILER HAS STUTTERING !!!!
Wow this game looks cool      when its on a cinematic trailer...
Finally some CONTENT
IMO, Better update BF5 than BF2042
Season 1 only took about 8 months, now they have 6 months to get 3 seasons worth of content out
Too much time spent on the trailer an not enough on what you getting. This is a joke right???? EA? DICE??? you F***ng with me now right?.......come on this has to be some kind of joke.
Need more maps!
One map? Rly?
If only I could get a refund on this game now. Missed my window. Oh and battlepasses have ruined games
Whatever the new map is, the core mechanics are broken. Those specialists are ruining teamplay, game modes are non-creative and the rest of maps are same old giant empty fields. If this particular update brings a way more content or a brand-new game mode so it would probably shake the game… but actual update won’t change a lot - it is still not our battlefield. Even BF V plays good these days and have more people online. Dice better produce some content for V
Looks cool I like specialist more than classes ❤️👍🏽
this game is absolute dog water
WOOOO!!! YEAH BABY NEW CHARACTERS, NEW SKINS, AND NEW WEAPONS, NEW VEHICLES, 😁😁
Ahhh, it's been June 9 for over 18 hours now. Why can't I play this...?

Battlefield 2042: Zero Players
I’m embarrassed to be a Battlefield player 😞
Zero Hour? Is this the name of the amount of time humans spend in the game, or EA's internal code-word for its impending class-action lawsuit?
Dislike Button
Womanfield 2042
I heard that there are only 11 or 10 persons working on BF2042 an the rest of the employees are workin on other game, but i don't know if it's true or just a rumor
Yay more helicopters, because they aren't already op 😐
i dont think battlefield will ever make a game as good as it used to be :(
1map 😂😂😂😂😂 what the hell are you doing at dice ?!?!?
Even Medal of Honor is more fun than 2042
No offense, but it’s little too late for all this. No one cares about this game anymore.
Looks so  not interesting
wow, almost a year for one empty map and a gun.
please make battlefield 6 and keep the graphics same as battlefield 3
lol, bury this game already, it's dead.
金返せボケ
It’s too bad the game blows
This is hyping me up for what the game can become in the future, but I'm fairly sure EA is going to pull the plug on this one like they did with BFV and Battlefront II.
아니 씨벌 무기 해금이 안된다닌까?
Too little, too late. DICE let their guards down too many times and need to face the consequences.
Nobody cares anymore about battlefield. You are done. RIP
Only if they could make a game as good as they make trailers
Too bad the game litteraly does not function proprely
Is the battle pass free for people who bought it day one?
I think I own this accidentally as I bought the expensive version at launch. I still won’t be reinstalling. You’re not going to save your game with a lazy Battle Pass that’s 7 months late.
Just in time to avoid a lawsuit lmao
Has the game been fixed yet? Servers, bugs glitches? Or is it still bad
0:55 this shot was super satisfying for some reason lol
Looks pretty good. Was hopping for levolution tho
Nice Dice!
Can’t wait! Through all the hate and bad vibes I’ve played since launch and will not give up on this game!
*This game should be free..change my mind..*
trailer music plis
I need a refund.
How hard is it to make Battlefield 4 with modern graphics?
HELIKOPTA HELIKOPTA
They'll just never get back that BF3, 4 charm
Liberal Dice does it again  weak 1 map and a chick Russian operator no less trash
Lol c’est tout ?! Vous nous faites attendre 8 mois pour ça ?! 1 Maps ????
If u guys fix the aim assist then I can go back to play it on ps5 👍🏻
Female soldiers BatChest
How about make battlefield 4 series x enhanced, without premium it has more content than this hotdog water game
BF RIP(
they should have fired every one except this trail guy.
Only one maps ?!?
Don't be sad! This is just how it works out sometimes!
So much content. No context.
Wear are need WEAPONS MIMIMUM 30. !!!!!
Only two new weapons? My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
Is there even a point in having Russians in this game when they aren't even the second best army in the world, let alone in the Ukraine.
Keeping expectations low this time :(
I don't care.
I had more fun watching the trailers for the game than playing the game itself
I won't believe a single thing in this trailer until I see it in game for myself.
How is this trending but he MW2 trailer isn’t.
I Want to Know how Mans Dislikes the Video has earned
why not make a Battlefield 4 remaster with everything you have now.  and give you new content.  like a new killstreak system, which can only be used by squad leaders.  and please no specialists do not help at all.
Free, right?
So Dice thinks a battle pass will save this game?
So véhicules is content now? Let's wait to 2023 for ground attack jets
I'd still like to get my refund for the gold purchase.
Mechs Mechs Mechs Mechs
cant they just exactly to the bit remaster bf4 and then keep that up for 20 years then we are all good best game ever cause bf4 is the best one ever
Should have released an update for battlefield 4 tbh
Battlefield was amazing. BF4 was the last time I enjoyed it. Get back to what Battlefield was, intense team battles on big maps, not old ladies running around empty maps.
To the one guy working on the game you did well
Use me for a dislike button. We all know this game is trash.
There are no servers to play on. So what does this bring to the game.
Why do these graphics look worse than BF1?
SO much hate in the comments. Map looks sick, guns look clean. Excited for the future.
🙏🏻❤️
A day late and a dollar short Dice
I wish publisher would show us 100% pure gameplay footage only.
Literally bf3 trailer... "new map... Donovan peak I mean exposure"
...Battlefield 5 could have had D-Day and Stalingrad...Battlefield 1 could have added Serbia and Africa...Battlefield 4 could have just been upgraded and supported to this day.
Glad DICE took the extra time on this, even if it is disappointing that there isn’t more. New map looks great. Now that the game is where it needs to be I hope they are given the time and resources to continue supporting it.   It’s EA, not DICE, that forced the game to release in an unfinished state. I’m sure the developers are working hard to salvage its reputation and I hope the community will be more supportive
Why would they name a season after my average playtime after launch?
If you don't make more content and 240 people on the map and more map with lots of vehicles then we Russians will make it real and destroy your company.  Because we believe that our nation is participating in some second-rate game, there is no more greatness of this game, you have 2 months.
Dont buy ea games !!! WW3 IS BETTER
gibtn dislike
so glad I didn't spend $60 on this, whew
I'm ready to be disappointed again
Questo gioco poteva essere IL GIOCO, come sempre avete rovinato tutto.   -Un grande Fan di Battlefield.
0.49 tank driving thru the background is what made battlefield so much fun with friends, please allow for more nuanced interactions nstead of linear map designs.
Please ppl don’t buy into this trash, they don’t care about there fans or community, just your wallet. There are way better game companies out there than this one. Support them instead.
... saison 1.... 🤣🤣🤣
How do you guys manage to make such good trailers
It’s just my the same, not a real battlefield anymore
When the video and the music makes it feels epic... then you load the game and you realize it will never make you feel like that. In fact play BTF1 or BTF4 and you will feel more exited than to this trailer. My god. And the fact he map if called "Exposure" haha. I want to believe... I want to believe...
Na I'm gonna play Modern Warefare 2
Go back and play Battlefield 4 folks. BF2042 is a joke 😔
OOouf...:(
I need a comparison video of the trailer and the real game again. watching those for vanilla 2042 was pure joy haha
Oh look a corpse.
How do I play this game (
DO NOT FALL FOR THIS AGAIN!
After 8 months they haven't even fixed freezing and stuttering on xbox series x and are rolling out 1 map and 2 unbalanced helicopters
Wait they just released season one 🤡
the trailer looks really really great, but it also looked like the first trailer on BF2042.. Well, we all know how it turned out
How can a game look so good and appeal to fans so much but then be none of it?
Those who say this game is saved by this content, you can’t save a dead man so why can you save a dead game?
People still play this?
Hey, new map looks neat! I wonder if they're also finally getting rid of speciali--oh
Excited for this!!!
Only 1 map? 😴
When I first saw name "LIS", I thought it was "US", hoping for default soldier for each team :(
it's being reported that only a skeleton crew is working on it to do the bare minimum so they can move on to BF7, it will soon be dead.
With the addition of this new chic, if they don't remove Sundance's grenade belt there wont be any vehicle players lol.
This trailer looks like it was fan made, if you think this looks good, i wanna know what you are smoking.
The new map actually looks really good. Hats off to you dice👏
Dead game
The marketing team does a 10x better job than any actual developer, it's very suprising
Patch 1.0.0 oh, Battlefield finally get out of beta 🤣
it's kinda sad but funny that there are sill people working everyday on this dumpster fire. literally NOONE is going to install this ever again 🤣
RIP DICE
I wonder what would happen if EA/Dice made the products as good as their trailers?, a man can dream
dead game
MW 2 vs bf 2042  zero houer in terms of trailers   bf wins lol
Cant wait to play this with the other 200 players still online.
I wish this game was good. I've been dying to buy this game.
Just watched jurassic world dominion today and the map kinda reminds me of the biosyn sanctuary. Especially the structures sticking out of the mountain sides.
People still playing this? Even BFFs aren't.
n1 <3
Bro, for years I've always said that Battlefield trailers are exactly how they look like when you play the games. I want that actual feeling back now.
Good piece of work right here guys! Proud of everyone working on it  Guys we can stop all the negativity around this, they are aware we need more and that its a bit late for it
air Jordan Olympics 7 "love of games" size 9 70% off at flight club nyc. firsf come first serve. market high 2k. selling $400+. Used box only, boarding shoes
Nice try, still not interested the slightest in this failure of a game
No
The trailers looked good. Shame anyone who actually played the game knows the truth.
Your like 8 months late guys...
shooter turned into a game for girls
Dead game lol
I do not care about this game.
You betrayed us and i will never forget it
Does anyone still play this?
i now play more gritty mature tactical paced game like squad, insurgency, even ww3 is more mature n on boot feeling game, i think bf series is more n more becoming child n youngster game market now, so good luck competing with other child n youngster game tittle, n btw too much spreadout content is not very good too "no focus" n feels like a sandbox game than a mature tactical game, especialy the ui too flashy  n too much, a boring n clear ui sometimes is a better ui bf1 bf4 bf5 ui is better btw, n try to play with no minimap use direction like squad game, but at least all in all its all depends on ur target, theme n vision of the game, "CLASSROLE" IS CRUCIAL THING ABOUT BATTLEFIELD SERIES, IT IS BATTLEFIELD
Someone needs to tell them this game is dead.
Gotta pay to unlock new guns 😐
Oh yeah, this game is still a thing.
I'm sure many bots will enjoy this new patch, i will give to this season exactly Zero hour, thanks for offer
New battlefield supposed to be BF4 a like, not this circus show If you cant make something better, just update BF4 with new maps and engine/graphics
still trash
1 map lol
Im gonna need to have that soundtrack
more weapons at least
fool me once...
It's a predator drone, it's literally in all aspects a predator drone from Modern Warfare.. except it doesn't come from the sky. Even the zoom, and the sudden burst of speed...
Too little to late
THE AS VAL!!!
season1: ZERO content
love the yellow theme
Refund everyone
must’ve named this season after peoples game time
Man I can't wait to completely forget about this game again in half a week
Only if the game had these graphics, and not the washed-out blurry ones that it has right now, had no stuttering issues, ran well, had more content, and no specialists - I would play it for sure.
So happy this game is getting turned in the right direction. Currently all I’m playiny
Season 1: Zero Content
I redownloaded to give it a second shot… well it’s not as bad as it was when it released. It still has its problems. But the game feels freshened up and Im happier.
Bet this battle pass will take longer then halo’s.
神ゲーになって帰ってきてる説
YouTube removing dislikes really helps this trailer look good huh?
I have hope 😫
Just 2 New Weapons for real
There are more people in the trailer than the actual playerbase.
Bro idk y ppl h8ting on dis game. I mean i like it i dont see anything bad abt it except bugs
Still can't believe I wasted $120 for the ultimate edition, never again. 🤣
Only one map lmao this company
Eww
U C A V
Battlepass progression better be quick or I'm gonna lose interest very quick
remove sundance
Dead game. We want the old Battlefield.
Sorry - fooled me once using slick game trailers...not gonna happen again.
this game is dead.
This Video has 31000 dislikes
trailer voice guy: "in an alternate universe, where EA and Dice release an actual good game, comes..."
Looks good! Say what you want all but they have been working hard to improve it!
this content is like a pay DLC or any type of copy of the game can play ?
Та ну,такое по-моему,все равно хуня
Joke
You can improve graphics - but if you F up the gameplay its over
I hope it aint bad it looks good
CANADA!!!
Bah
I hope they save this game like BF4. I mean just look at this trailer man. So much potential
If it not free I'm not buying
From what i heard exposure may make the game playable
ur anti-cheat sucks
とりあえずPS4とPS5のクロスプレイ可能にしてください
I‘m so sad about the Battlefield saga. What is this seriously? I bought 2042 and stopped playing after 2 hours cause people were flying around glitching with jumps etc. Player since Bad Company 2 BTW the best imo
Nah! you're not redeeming yourselves with this one DICE.
Well, they know how to make trailers.
just refund ！
The AI's are looking forward to this update
Season 1 :Zero Content
I have never seen any studio in such a state of detachment from reality
There's a typo in the title, it has to be zero content, doesn't it?
Imagine if the dislike ratio was visible
The game is never as good as the trailers. This trailer looks awesome
It’s time to turnaround.
When will we have adaptative triggers functions on the game🥲
More dislikes the likes,  thats what I love to see
Battlefield gender inclusivity
Remember Guys, Trailer is everything they want to be exposed.
DICE DEVS :  - Working on trailers ✔ - Working on game ✖
It's like a mobile game. Great ads, terrible game...
Bf1 is where’ it’s at- we still have huge lobby’s on bf1 - sad man. Portals works great but the new game is unplayable-
We should be happy DICE fixed bugs and is still fixing it..2 New weapons and a New map...i hope we get more WWII maps for Portal mode weapons tanks planes and helikopters in upcoming seasons for all Modes..this game is gonna be awsome if DICE does it...
2 f**** weapon (one even not a rifle..), only 1 Map and nothing else besides an unwanted specialist and two Helis? are you serious this is all for the whole season?? This will be my last BF game i purchased ... and i even did the huge mistake to buy the ultimate...
Map looks like a soccer field.
why not sequel battlefield Vietnam remake graphics and shooting mechanics!!!
Looks like EA’s putting out the bare minimum required to legally meet the season pass standards, because the game didn’t sell well.  This Battlefield game is a joke!
Community: "Get rid of specialists, we hate them". Dice: "Here's a new specialist."
fool me that i expected at least 5 guns for each class, give me more snipers
love it
Imagine coming here just to complain more about specialists
same game as always just different maps game is trash
*Please BACK 128 players in breakthrough!*
Where is LEVOLUTION ?
Zero Content
1 Map "2" Guns of which one is a meme... and 1 Spezialist after like what ? 7 Months ? its a joke guys... in bf 3 we had the aftermath dlc after this amount of time which was the 4th out of 5 dlcs for the game and that included 4 new maps... so you tell me this will go on for how long ? Maybe 7 more months for a new gun ? great in 6 yeahrs we will have half the amount of guns we had in bf4 at release great job.
hope DICE gets closed down for releasing this utter abomination of a game and LOL at the miniscule season 1 content.... enjoy unemployment   AND STILL NO SERVER BROWSER AND DEDICATED SERVERS......  so much for this game being "a love letter to the fans" more like a "dear john letter" but  most like  a "suicide note"
too much women screams in Bf 0/10
Looks AMAZING! What game is this?
Maybe a campaign would've been better after all, hopefully the main line Battlefield game will have it, BF6
Trash…
Время П - Похорон
Only if you don't ever take again battlefield games as a service, and just as a game, you will have this saved
Zero Content…
muy bonito el trailer, habra que ver como se jugara... ganas tengo
21K Likes and 30K Dislikes. LOL
Fix the game plz
music????
The map is to big
1 map, 2 guns, 2 helicopters, 1 specialist, it took more than 6 months. You do you
Nobody really cares about BF2042 anymore.
very good news . I am Happy :) thank you Dice
Where destruction? 🤯🤬 and only 1 map
I did buy it a few months ago and got my money back the game felt horrible but this map looks nice but it wont change my mind to buy it again unless they really do a lot of improvements
what in the mobile game
I figured if I got the ultimate edition I would get everything for free. I guess I’m wrong 😑
30K dislikes lmfao
CANNOT WAIT 😁😄
Every single clown at dice and ea that was responsible for this fiasco should be fired and never be involved in ANY game ever again. Clueless morons.
Wow one new map!!!! This game is truly epic!
It's just not enough
НУ И ДЕРЬМИЩЕ
Man I wish we can see those dislikes
Is this game actually good?
One map. 😭
またやろうかな。
i wish it sounded this good the sound design in the game is below standards
Wenn ich den Trailer so sehe, bekomme ich bock auf Battlefield 4.
1 map 1 gun 2 vehicles just not battlefield anymore sorry I say that cuz been playing sense 2003
Why would you STILL even consider playing this when there's a TON of good games to play nowadays?
I enjoyed all of the BF games, but i also never bought them in full price.....Battlefield 3 is the one i have the most hours on and i got it, when origin was giving it away for free. So like i always do. I'll get this game when its over 50% off.
Zero hours of content*
Screw the haters, the game was buggy as hell and had its flaws but its come a long way and i'm still having fun, even more now.
И это первый сезон? - Позорище))
When they’ve got the audacity to release a dlc trailer….
참나 진짜 지랄병이네 진짜 이게뭐야
😎
And people say the game is dead
Клоуны
Just stop it embarrassing
Y'all ruined the BF series. Just let it die now.
Zero destruction.
また期待していいんですか？
I didn't have brutal expectations, yet I was disappointed. So little in such a long time.
While the gameplay reaaaaly sucks though
When you guys going bankrupt?
Song: Position Music - Mission Zero
no one cares anymore give up.
So after 8months since the release of this, all we getting are 2 vehicles 2 guns a gadget a map and a specialist with 100-6 decos no one care.
Zero Hour, Zero Players. Ultimate update!
NO ONE CARE
Omg I’m so hyped! This is my favourite battlefield 😍😍 game and I’ve been here since battlefield 3   - Said no one ever
Just make it free, and for sure ur game will come to light
where is battlefield 4 siege of shanghai portal map. they could or redeemed themselves but again they messed it up
looks like battlefield 2 but a kids version
Yo! My Bro doesn't play Battlefield, but he never misses a Battlefield Trailer...... These guys are the best at these Trailers
สวย กว่าจะมาเซ็ทหย่อรอตั้งนาน
I am from Ukraine I am for the USA Remove Russia or flag
Why a new specialist? The map also looks boring
Trash
Bro please give back angles ability to give armor that was the best part of my boy
make a Battlefield 4 but better, with better graphics, designs and new maps, you're welcome for the idea that people have been saying for 500,000 years
WE need a Bartelroyal
can you give the link to the ost in this video ty
Поздравдяю EA и Dice Швеция. Вы проебали свою франшизу Battlefield. Обидно за серию, а в этом как раз вы виноваты.
Need more maps ! from BF3 & bad company maps!  Shhheeeeeesh  save your name DICE ..
Cool video, wish it played the same.
TrashFaild 2042 <3
Is EA still relevant?
everyone seeing my comment : it's not easy to make series with more than 7 games, even making a 2nd and a 3rd one is hard because of what people want and are waiting for, the more you do the more it get harder  respect to DICE for these amazing work and series
All of the time and money wasted on this when all the majority really want is a refund
Can’t wait!! Next trailer
Use as DISLIKE button.
1:00  the ammo decreasing before shooting, just like the playerbase
As expected the game is dead. To hell with specialists, classes are the basis of the battlefield.
Omg wow beautiful
lol a map leaked 6 months ago ahah the joke of the year oh wait no we have 2 guns 1 specialist !!! did the AA one shot Héli like the trailer ? humm i think 10 AA is more realistic
I wonder if there might be new gamemodes like a spec ops styled matches
Really??!!!!! Only this??!!!! Jajaja, Trashfield 🤑🤑🤦🏻‍♂️
we are evolving      just backwards
people actually playing this?
How long will it take to leave Early Access?
Dead game lol
I literally forgot that this game existed
Why I only saw "two new weapons added"? tell me it's just that the trailer didn't say, there are actually five or six new weapons, right?
21k likes 29k dislikes rn
Do people even play this game?
Great it’s going to turn into apex. They’ll start adding these ridiculous characters and just keep adding woman specialist and barely any male specialist. Wish they’d go back to just regular soldiers and just let you pick male or female
ye but does the game run yet?
в это говно ещё кто-то играет?
Not bad, but it's not enough.
It's too late for the game to redeem itself, it's already dead..
RESPECT :)
We waited this long for one new map and a crossbow? Too little too late...
Zero hour? More like zero content
zzzzzzzzzzz more of the same. garbage game. let it die.
When the trailer is 100x better than the game.
1 map, 2 weapons, 2 heli, 1 "specialist", what a joke that deadgame is
👎👎👎
what kills me is that the end clip where the guy grapples onto the jet, even *SHOWS* how buggy this game is visually with the guys arms spazzing out because he's moving so fast from being hooked onto the jet.... poor fellas at DICE cant even QA their trailers.... DICE has fallen, and theyre never getting back up guys...
They still haven't come to their senses.
at least the marketing team still has some idea of what battlefield should be
People are actually playing this game?
New Specialist... aight imma head out...
Remaster battlefield 4 then I’ll be back
Cant wait for a propah battlewankin
Does the battlepass work across all platforms you own?
Как запороть перевод zero hour? Вместе "Час Ч" перевести как "Время Ч"то за....
Yeah nice trailer, glad never bought it, back to BFV I go
At least the trailer looks awesome. But I have zero expectations. And probably there are zero players too...
21000 likes and 29000 dislikes so far...
THE GAME IS DEADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
"HEY WHATSUP YOU GUYS"
*ZERO CONTENT*
Ah yess let’s add more anti air to the already I can’t leave my spawn without being locked on anti air. You give ground troops 101+ Ways to down aircraft but I get one flair that takes 30 seconds to reload and in that time I’ve been locked on and shot at by Everyone on the map. Flying might as well be removed from the game at this point.
game looks awesome what is the issue?
Thank you to the people that worked on this. I know some decisions are out of your hand.
Trailer most better because the game....
zero player
cant wait  the battlepass looks better than r6 or warzone  will be the first battlepass i ever buyed
Is this game still alive?
they want grabe our money for pass , they think players are cow ! and game still broken , what a shame EA . no thanks that never happen twice .
WE WANT BOATS WE WANT BOATS
Genuinely feel bad for the devs. There's probably alot of effort put in, but funding being put in all the wrong places and lack of care from corporate. At the end of the day it's very difficult to do something good and accomplish something when corporate and upper management has a such a big discontinued
Another Specialist, great.
Anyone going to mention the bots in the comments trying to sell pu$$y ?
So many GD vehicles. WHY DICE?!
1 map and 2 weapons? Rlly .....
at last, we get some real BF vibes👍
At this point, i would just show what is fixed in the game, because we all know the gameplay is nowhere near this gameplay trailer.
and gameplay with high ping room 😕
Current likes: 26k Current dislikes 42k  Friendly reminder google offers an extension that shows dislikes again 😁
Ppl still play this game?
Love BATLEFIELD
Vamo
❤️❤️
Love BATLEFIELD LET'S GO 2042
Somos los mejores Grande Batlefield 👌
Batlefield lo Máximo 🤗❤️
Serious question for diehard battlefield fans name one BF in recent years (that's BF 4, hardline, 1 and 5) that had a solid launch ???
Grande Batlefield 👌😎
Eight months of waiting for 1 new weapon, 1 map, 1 specialist and 1 vehicle without fixing any of the massive glaring issues. Yeah, no.
Love seeing low fps trailers, open maps and more cheese weapons/gadgets
Sorry to say but even the trailer looks like it doesn’t feel like battlefield
We shall see what this will do for the game. EA has brought back games before but this game has gotten such had PR.
Pretty sure the trailer guys do their jobs while the rest of DICE don’t
@1:35 Can anyone with better playback controls tell me the time it takes to reach full speed here? I'm on a rabbit-hole trying to figure out the physics- according to a google search it takes somewhere between 30 to 200 kN to rip off human arms.  In contrast, my initial calculations came out to ~5500 kN, with pretty conservative values (-10mph to 400mph over 1 second, with the F22 weighing in at 30,000 kg)
Most uninspired music ever in BF
Again very disbalanced map and helicopters. With buggy elevators.
Are there still people who play and want to pay more for this DLC?
EA:  I already try to buy the game, it's 60 USD more to play it 😀
Zero Hour? yea, that is the exact time devs put on the game :D
Эта игра умерла
Perai, esse jogo terá um passe de batalha e pago ainda por cima? Um jogo full price?
Still waiting until its free
Keep in mind that it took 8 months to drop content back in bf4 the third dlc woulda released which means 12 maps were added in 8 months and 2042 gets one what a joke
the map looks pretty decent
Is this a mobile game or a PC game?
Yawn. Looks like I'll just be sticking with BF4 for now.
Not enough. Not even remotely enough.
Game finally working?
それよりも早くスペシャリスト制を消して兵科制に戻してください。AIスキンはそのまま使用して兵科制にすれば良いでしょう？新しく3Dモデルを作るにしても素顔、素手は極力出さないでください。
Meh still not enough to bring me back
Looking at the dead cat bounce of the bf2042 player base.
That grapple onto the jet was amazing/kill, whoever maiking these trialers caring battlefield rn no cap
BF 2042 players
Wow. What a fantastic trailer. I bet the people who worked on it are very Handsome and smell good.
why are y’all even trying😂😂
Lettsss gooo...baby
it wouldn't surprise me if they have lowered the maps and guns released per season because it flopped, and are just drip feeding the post launch content to fulfil the four seasons promised in the ultimate and gold editions
Trash
It’d be cool if this update saves the game but I’m not optimistic
kek lel lul
8 months of waiting and what do you get.... 2 new guns and ONE new map. Is this a late april fools joke?
you can finally grapple onto vehicles that's poggers no cap
grapple hooked a jet at the end there just cause 2 style, nice
Battlefield they cheated on us After all this waiting and therefore they give us one map and two weapons !! What are we a children to convince us of this content I want my money back 😠🤬 😤
Uh no thanks I don't trust BF anymore.   Mayor Fuglycool
8 months in, 2 new weapons. 1 of which was already seen 2 times in previous BFs. GG DICE
Welp.....yeah that's all I got.  Map looks good. Reminds me of Battlefield 3 a bit.  But uhm....yeah.....no one wants specialists still.....like no one.
Is this dlc
They've fixed a lot of bugs and at this point the game feels like it should have on release, but boy are we lacking content...
Can't believe they still add Russians in the game. Just change it to something fictional.
Бабы какие-то.
For those that can't see the dislikes. Its 20k Likes / 27k Dislikes
just put bf4 in the portal please
ill give it a shot
DICE: WE FINALLY HAVE A NEW CONTENT AND FIXED SOME THINGS!  Battlefield community: dead game lol
It looks so clunky
That's it?
욕하지만 게임 하고 싶게 만드네....
27k dislikes . too late  to bring this game out from grave
Can someone tell is bf2042 we only olay as US and RU because i want morr factions to join or something
Honestly they should just make 2042 a show or a movie. The trailers and Exodus were great.
Nice trailer BF!  ...but no thanks. New specialist? Meh.
Content looks good but there should be way more of it, it's been 8 months
So it’s 2042, and you gotta steer the a2a missile?
They just need to can this game and start working on the next one. Worst BF ever
もう誰も騙されないだろう。 アンインストールした人の中でもう一度ダウンロードする人はいるのか？
Trash
Optimization left
You lost the right to end your trailers with clips like that after the reveal for this game.
It looks great. Too bad it runs terrible. Please just fix this game
Okay awesome but will it play the same  with no bugs that can kill the gameplay
Witness the death of a franchise. No SP, 8 months of delayed content, limited content being released, unlikable characters. EA/Dice really know what their players want. 👌
🤮Apex:2042 down to hell
dead game
Zero hour zero players
What The hell…
they should release this for free as a sorry for people who paid even for the regular
Can we sue EA yet ?
You want the good OG battlefield 3 & 4 dev team? Well they been working on this free to play game coming out this year. ARC Raiders
I swear if they put any drag queen transformers in this game....................🖕🖕🖕🖕
They just sold us a trailer and we all fell for it
Well at least the trailer is honest on how crusty the game looks and plays! Still love how its pretty much all hype and now abandoned, no continuation of the story like they had pre-launch  But hey the MUSIC is better, not a broken record screeching! (left wondering if the game has crashed or not LOL)  Zero hour, more like Zero content!  6+months.... and this is what is presented...
generic weak trailer, forgettable music, primitive scenes
guess what vcav's are back. YAY!!!!!!! not
dead game
Not free yet for dead game
GAME ENGINE FOOTAGE. NOT ALL IMAGES APPEAR IN-GAME.
26k dislike...lol the down vote on stream...good job bf
It's about time that there's a MAJOR update to this game with season 1. Now I'm stoked to play it!
They can make trailers alright
Bf3
27k dislike explains everything.
BF6 has such oversaturated colours. I’ll seriously take the blue tint over this
Can't believe we waited so long for a game that, at its core, is flawed in such a way that I doubt it will ever feel like battlefield without a complete overhaul that we all know isn't coming. What an utter shame this game is. Bf1 and BFV are some of my favorite games ever but they just drained away everything that makes battlefield fun to play and let toddlers design the maps.
At least the trailer guys weren't slacking off
I will spend Zero Hours playing this game in the future
Battlefield 2042 Season one: Zero Content
Vemos que a dice mantém a qualidade dos traillers,só desaprendeu mesmo foi a fazer os jogos.
Did you fix the plane's flight model or do they still fly wrong?
Это было классно, но жалко мне не поиграть на моём полене в BF2042
Dislike
If only the dislike button was still visible
Imagine pitching the idea that an F-35E Panther could be two-shot out of the air by a crossbow... yet that's in the trailer.
I’m sure all 20 people playing will enjoy this season 😂🤣🗑
And a battle pass... how original Like if it isn't an already paid game
There is hardly anything here because the last 7 months were used to fix bugs and finish the game instead of making substantive content.
Is there new MUSIC tho? 🤔
What a comeback got my attention again
Lol hard pass
If advertising laws were actually legally enforced on big companies, this would definitely be hit big.
Such a great game concept, yet such poor execution.
Zero Hour? More like 5808 Hours since we got content
Ever since EA got their hands on Battlefield, I feel like the end products have been going downhill.
Trailer was sick af  Wish the game was actually good tho  Im still also salty that this game had no campaign
Still not coming back if we can't play as groups 4+ without being separated at the end of every match. Such dumb design decisions, you killed your own community. Used to upgrade our PCs for each new battlefield, now there's no point, enough good old games already. That's thousands every couple of years not being spent on pc parts any more because why bother.
At least the new specialist looks like a more aggressive soldier
Too little, way too late. Just remaster bf3 and let's call it a day
ONE MAP? ONE MAP? Lmao crazy
Were the players in this trailer bots? No way it's that populated.
trailer 9/10 game 2/10
Con todo respeto esperamos 8 meses para un solo mapa?
Maybe everyone who already owns the battle pass will get on tomorrow. LoL cause right now servers are empty
LMFAO
who asked for a crossbow?
I wouldn't put it past them to tie the new weapons to the Battle Pass so the only way to get them is to pay...
2 helis, 2 weapons and 1 new map. Ok
This game should be free to play.
atleast it has minimal covers right?
😎😎👍👍👍
So still no destructible buildings?
I'm convinced that the devs just didn't hire a PR team.
I'm here to dislike the video and complete dissuade folks from supporting this robbery of a game. Cut content now dlc? Screw this game and franchise. Never again.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
fix your game scammers.
Is it me or is this gender thing in gaming is gone too far? All I see and hear are women on the battlefield like seriously where are all the men?
I'll only play it when it comes to gamepass/eaplay.
Disney+,BF2042
I want to belive that the main floor of this map can be taken down like the building in BF4, cause that would be next gen. And put helmets on the characters for god sakes. The crossbow at the end...i will keep waiting for now.  Thanks for the trailer, the main song is epic.
A little late for this. The game is already dead.
Where's my refund DICE/EA?
This is not Battlefield wchich we remember, andwhich we want.
expectations are low but i will still try it out  cant get disappointed if your expectations are low to begin with
Didnt this game release last year?
Battlefield 2042 has a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft in season 1?
Only 1 map, 1 specialist, 2 guns and 1 chopper. Lame after the state of the game in release and 8 months in already
All their effort went into the trailer it seems.  Who else laughed when it said "New Weapons" and yet it only showed 1 gun......   Dice, take away specialists, make the maps 64 players, put all modern portal maps, vehicles and guns into the base game, and give us what we've continually been asking for.
Coming to Netflix ™ . These movies fool no one, CEO Andrew Wilson.
Imagine if the game was actually good lmao. Couldn’t see that happening.
Liars
I still think it was the dumbest decision ever to abandon BFV instead of fixing it, we wouldn’t have got this horrid game.
JUST PUT THE GAME FREE TO PLAY , IS BEST FOR EVERYONE
never again
*Not actual gameplay footage
It's been 8 months since the first release date
They make amazing trailers and amazing BROKEN games LOL
Why the announce is not translated into Russian? I payed 70 bucks twice to play an early access game for 8 months and now you don't even translate info?!
pre disliked!
New specialist has a controllable rocket? It's been done way too many times. Rocket could've just been added as another gadget. So lazy for a new specialist
One things for sure, Dice knows how to make a trailer!
I swear if I don't get the battlepass for free with my year 1 pass I'm going to be pretty upset.
Can we get a dislike train going no this.
Its becoming a solid shooter .. I'm sticking with it .
A guided rocket launcher? Nothing could possibly go wrong at all I'm sure of it.
You know what I love about this video? The comments. But I have no doubt if the next battlefield is bad. Then everyone that hated 2042 will be calling this a great game. Kind of what's happening right now with Battlefield 5.
I wish I felt something when I watch bf2042 videos. Can I have my $80 back @ea?
Free for all players as an apology, no doubt. Insert sarcastic tone.
Trailer is good, but need bug tracker site like in BF4.
WOW a big empty map named "Exposure". Sure sounds like they have been listening to our feedback!
1 new map and 2 new weapons for 3 whole months!
I new it they got this go bf2042
Still has specialist. Still not a BF game, move along people. Nothing to see here.
Game is dead 😆
removing dislikes huh?
Definition of top little too late.
Ya no les creo. Arruinaron la franquicia. Con decisiones tontas.
Give me bf v content and bann the cheaters man !!!!!!!! I dont need 2042 or make bf4 remasters !!!!
Dice the best doing traillers!!!
i feel so bad for this game, like it is one step away from being the best game of the decade but instead ruined by cash grab company. and the team still tries to give us what we want even the game is failing.
Lets be honest..we can admit the TRAILER looks good. So as the FIRST trailer about the game itself, and we all know now, that the game was a horrible mess... I mean, yea it looks good and I believe that the developers wants to patch this up...but...lets be real. Dont invest more time and energy to this dead game..you made a season pass for bots or to who ? To those 50 players playing it ?.... Better learn something from these fails and make a PROPER game and take your time and of course LISTEN actually LISTEN to the PLAYER FEEDBACK and NOT to the shareholders...because the PLAYERS are the ones, who buy your game and play the game and not the shareholders....thank you and wish you the best.
What's dices obsession with the crossbow?
Al ver esto se me viene a la mente que puede ser una intro del red alert... que puxx asco.
PCfield 2042
i miss the dislike button
Can't wait to play this with all my bot friends
1st battle pass, zero refunds.  At least for those who buy into the scam.
"hyped!" said no one ever.
Stop showing us these cool trailers Dice, it hurts too much
hmm what'll save this game? We know! Virtue signal with more women, gamers loved it when we did it in BFV.
EA/Dice really know how to make a trailer.
Hope they turn this game around. I want them to succeed
mid
What did I just watch!! It had my full attention lol
So how’re those player counts dice?
Trailer: *shows off new content*  Me: do I hear music from the anthem (legion of dawn) trailer??
Zero Players... :(
BF 2042 come back to reclaim greatness again
the bots are going to have a blast this new season....good for them
2/10
What a dsigrace. Glad you are trying tho, keep going to see if this game can become somewhat decent al least. Guys, remember the initial state of BF4. We can only pray now...
ZERO CONTENT
You're out of your mind if you think i'm paying anymore money for this game. Pass better be free
No mans sky is better.
Обнова огонь!🫡 c&c generals: zero hour
It feels like they put much more work to the trailer than the season 1 itself and this makes me hurt so much.
0:37 me running for speaking to dice's manager
2WEI never disappoints
This map is going to be insane on Breakthrough!
Took 8 months for one map, the marketing team is doing 10x better than the developers apparently
Dice needs to hire some more map designers i think. Map looks like a helicopter lovers dream and infantry nightmare.
This game is dead on PlayStation. You can't even get a full server anymore.
only one server with five dudes. the last time i try to play in origin in steam is beter or is the same server
The bots are gonna have a good time I see
I can’t believe I paid $90 for this thing. I’ll never buy another EA or DICE product again.
Фильм делать умеют, а карты нет, поля
Waited 8 months for 1 new map 😂
Will "season 1" (if you can even call it that) finally have my refund 8 months later? You guys are an absolute joke.
I think this game is going to be better like the previous bf it will take time  but it will be good again
Awful game. No feedback taken on board, and when it is, it takes eight months to be implemented, with bugs. Never buying another battlefield game again. Shame on you DICE.
what a joke of a game and company
i like how that tank is inside the building just like how u see in the game itself
Lmao 😂😂😂 get out of here EA and DICE. Should be ashamed of yourselves.
FIX YA GAMEEEEE
no one wants to play this, dude.
does this zero content update come with a refund?
Scrap this game and add more maps to BF1.
Looks like damabaman peak and capsicum border
so ready
I can say with confidence... I see efforts and game has improved a lot.. Iam enjoying it.
Yessssss looks awesome
2 weapons 1 map 2 helicopters - dice is incompetent
We all know why its called..."Zero Hour". Because ain't no one playing it.
Games awful trailers are unreal make it make sense what’s happened to battlefield. Worse thing is they stopped battlefront 2 from becoming the perfect Star Wars game for this. Has so much potential to become the galaxy we wanted it to be
wow. one map. few guns. 0/10
It sounds like a yearning for an old ex but Battlefield 3.... What a game!  Oooo crossbow!  Hahaha
We must stay focus brothers… we must stay focus
Use me as a “this game is trash” button
Sundance still breaking the game. And a character that fires a TV-guided missile… That in combination with everything else *still* wrong with the game; hard pass.
I expected as much in the initial launch....
Battlefield: zero content for zero players
I hate the fact, that Battlefield was about a big map and also big destructions.. to feel the atmosphere of real war. But again.. new maps and 0 destructions.
We were supposed to have flying cars already, according to the Back to the Future franchise.
It is safe to say that the people making the trailer learnt from their mistakes in bf5. Unlike some people!! 😁😁
Please tell me there's more maps than just one
Whatever happened to levelution.... You've been going backwards since bf4...
only ONE new specialist? oh boy,there's a long,LOOOOOOOOONG road ahead...
Imagine if the dislike button was still here 💀
10/4 🤮
zeeeeeeeeero  hour
One new map, so that's 8. By this point BF4 had 22 maps.  I tried but I got bored of this game months ago.
😱
Cancel this game
Dead game lol
Give us back our money better than this farce in the history of Battlefield  The name   Zero content  better than Zero hour
looking forward to the new map! new content looks good!
I wish I could still see the amount of dislikes, they've gotta be 4 times higher then the likes.
I mean this trailer looks good, but then again so did the first one and we all know how that turned out.
thanks for reminding me to unsub
Those dislikes 19k vs 24k
Na not with me its like eating a donut with mustard not falling for the trick twice EA!
i want my money back :D
This might have been cool 8 months ago
ありがとうDICE……それしか言葉が見つからない……
やはりBFは神だ！
Look I love battlefield in general but the lack of content, fixes, and a single player has made this game go under. I do not like to criticize since i get that it isn't easy to program but seriously when screwing fans with false hype it hurts that game. So the next update please add a single player campaign with the option to play co op just in case people want to say screw multiplayer and play with friends peacefully
8 months late and $59 short
map looks fun, wish the game was fixed by now though.
give it up for the love of god
Bring back Battlefield 4
Well now I miss the DLCs
Still waiting for the refund update.
This game looks like it runs terribly even in the trailer.
game is still more fun than halo and warzone to me
I don't play Battlefield anymore.
MWII 🙌🏻
Can we just get a remastered Battlefield 3?
Guys, what happend to Dice?
Too little too late
*YOU'RE TOO LATE, DICE. YOUR GAME IS ALDREADY DEAD.*
How this series comes from a masterpiece like  bf1 to that casual junk. I pre ordered premium 2042 after watched first trailer and then after release and play I also realized that I pre ordered wrong game it was junkfield 2042. Now I have 100 hours playing time junkfield experience thx dice
Thats it? Just stop,  and work on another game
Yesterday's update made the game feel much better on PC. I have hopes Season 1 will deliver what we want.
Nothing for Portal… disgraceful.
glad I installed the youtube dislike extension. Was totally unsurprised its 23k dislikes to the 19k likes hah
I guess I'll watch it
THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS
RIP... battlefield.. See you on the next series😭
Have you considered pivoting as an indie movie studio?
ok lets go back, come on boys.
Is the new map free to all players or do we need to pay for that content?
Why they give Russia advance weapons. There tanks and planes nowadays look like they from the 1970s. When 2042 comes they might look like they from 2005
Lets goooooooooooooooooo
Wheres the battlefield 2042 battle royale
With current 128 server's screwed awesome video.
this comment section passed the vibe check
Season 1 : Zero Content should be the name..
So Season 1 got us nothing and we have 3 more to go. You got 24K dislikes against 19K likes as of this moment. That tells you a lot, just cut this project completely and go back to BF V.
7 months just to give players (what remain of them) one map, one specialist, two weapons, and what appears to be some sort of modernized Comanche chopper. Kek
When is 128 breakthrough coming back?
Zero content
Zero Hour. The amount of time I played this game in 2022 and the amount of time I plan on playing this "DLC".
Why do they make the trailers so good but the gameplay so bad. I can’t take it. I want to play in the trailer so much.
those trees are actually stolen from skyrim? lol.. this level of vegetation is simply not allowed in 2022, in a game at this budget.. cmon
please tell me they added more cringe dialogue at the end of every match
This looks sick
Bruh... I forgot I was still subscribe to this channel
You guys like running across fields with no cover right? Here's more of that 0:14
Selling games with women soldiers, is like selling female soccer... nobody is watching that.
That was like getting told you are getting a pony, and they delivered a Shetland.  A little underwhelming.  I'd uninstall the game, if hadn't already done it a month ago.  Oh well, here's to waiting for the next one.
As long as specialists remain, the game will stay dead. Bring back classes.
Pretty... But in 8 months one map, two weapons?   Don't get mad at me, but modern warfare 2 will completely arrive this year
you will never be able to play a game like this😁
nope
Sadly, no new map for PORTAL and Hazard Zone? No 128 players Breakthrough? No server browser?
This will be only the second game in the Battlefield franchise I haven’t purchased.
Very cool looking map!
It's too late
If they delete this game and start from scratch it might actually be decent 🥲
This map looks good! Can't wait to get an infantry only map.
One map after 6 months of development is a joke to me. Now i want old DLC system back. Still no destruction and we are still waiting for rework (adding shipping containers) of the base game maps.
Get rid of the freaking battle pass man. Just trash the game already.
The most unrealistic part of this trailer is that the whole thing is at 60fps
DICE AO INVÉS DE FICAR PERDENDO TEMPO FAZENDO UM TRAILER BEM FEITO, POR QUÊ É QUE VOCÊS NÃO FAZEM UM JOGO BEM FEITO COM O TEMPO EXTRA QUE TERIAM DEIXANDO O TRAILER COM A GAMEPLAY REAL?
Zero hours .. the irony in the name doesn't escape me
Es su última oportunidad para poder enmendarse, porfavor háganlo bien
The kill feed still won't work though and show all kills
Making new maps and guns, instead of fixing old ones.  New map has FPS drops even in trailer Good job! it's sarcasm if you wonder. I really want to know, is that all what you have done for almost a year?
Can't wait to download this again in 3 years when it's playable and palatable.
This trailer makes me want to play the game. The price tag on the other hand doesn't.  And the lack of single player.
7 months too late
lmao
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
😎😎😎👌👌👌
A shoulder fired tv missile seems OP
2022.06.07.                               23:39
Still look garbage
I have a BF3 and BF4 flashbacks. This two game is the DICE's double masterpiece.
After bf3 bf4 bf1 I just gave up it was fun while it lasted
The gunplay looks so flaccid. Like there's no power into the firearms and some little crossbow? Who cares
Almost a whole year of no content and _this_ is the amount they're gonna give us? Yeah, no thanks. This is game is all but doomed
I am not falling for ypur fancy trailers anymore 😔
Mild music, mild content.  The Battlefield series sure has fallen far from the glory days of the Premium DLCs.  BF2042 has been an epic disappointment, and the golden color theme is hinting that the companies already have a mindset of just taking our money and sunsetting BF2042 before season 1 has even started.  They will just do the bare minimum.  It is triggering flashbacks of the BFV downfall that happened after the BFV Pacific DLC, which also introduced a golden color theme.  Also, this is 1/4 the content we used to get with Premium DLCs.  No wonder the official BF2042 soundtrack sounded so empty, depressing, and just plain awful.  Zero hour?  More like zero hype.
7 months all you to show was 1 map and 2 weapons lol
So have they fixed this mess of a game yet? played it day one and haven't since
This should have been out like 6 months ago before the user base died.
"Unleash the unexpected"? I did. I bought this game pre-launch thinking it would be a quality product.
LLBF3
Dice is dead they will never have the support of the gaming community again
easy kills because their bots
Cool  Now make this game free
Dope trailer looks fun !
I thought their will be some content after 8 months. Extremely disappointed. This game is just a big scam.
Please delay another four months, don't wanna overwhelm y'all.
Battlefield Zero Content
You gave us a broken game and then expect us to pay for more content!? Can tell you dont care about the community and more about the money.
It's called zero because some people just refuse to play this buggy cringe game
The trailer developers seem to handle brutal expectations pretty well!
Can we give these guys a second chance they dint deserve all this hate they lost staff between battlefield 5 and battlefield 2042 and now they have to recrute in the middle of the developement of the game no FPS game is perfect theres always gonna be something bug or gameplay
free to play ? yet
Battlefield 2042 is a big poo 🤮🤮🤮
I'm actually excited for this map. Honestly looks fun
Soundtrack is actual fire!
mehr Luftfahrzeuge statt weniger wären gut, bei 128 Spielern. Endlich Neuer Wind- Ich hoffe das es wieder mehr spaß macht.
you cant sell a game that doesnt have what we where promised and what we waited for
The trailer for the 2003 Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour got me more hyped then this
Awful
I'm certainly glad that they're taking notes from previous games; adding in things like the TV-guided missile from BF4, the crossbow w/ optional explosive arrows from BF3, and the new map seems to be heavily inspired from BF3's Damavand Peak, BF3's Caspian Border, and BF4's Giants of Karelia. It's things like this that show the developers are finally heading somewhat in the right direction. I just believe that because they had to focus so much on fixing stuff, that's the reason why we have such little content this season. Hopefully that changes in the future.
After 8 Months  Do Dice/ EA really think this is good.  1 ok-ish map 1 gun 1 crossbow 2 helicopters and a battle pass
deflated
I finally tried this game last week and I have to say, it’s nowhere near as bad as everyone says it is. However, everywhere you look you see small issues, and bizarre nonsensical design choices. Those add up very quickly to seriously hinder a potentially great experience.   This game has a seriously strong foundation, but the final execution is always such a misstep. Hopefully they can turn this around.
6 months for 1 map, 2 heli, 2 weapons and a specialist....  Sorry Dice, but this is not enough
remember, the original trailer was hype too. Dont trust this to be the experience
top gun movie released 30 years later dice rleasing comanche helicopter instead of f18 f14 jets.
Why has this legendary series become so unfortunate?
Honestly i dont understand why this is legal, they actually scam everyone, how they are not gonna get sued for this?
Can’t wait
Free to play?
Why do you lock all this stuff behind a Battle Pass? I know most of the meaningful things are available to everyone, but why not just...give it all to us, right away? It seems to pointlessly try to make us feel like we need to "acheive" something by unlocking these things, not to mention that it also means that those that play the most will have a power advantage in unlocking things before everyone else. Assuming everyone else is capable of unlocking it all.
We all know the trailers u guys create are awesome, but now its time to proof.
Plot twist that was all just bots because even the devs didn't want to play it.
I love how all the weapons of the future are from the Vietnam War era with shorter barrels
Haha zero hour And zero content 🤙
Wait….. how many months for 1 map, 1 operator?
ew a battlepass
Yo the last clip at the end where he attached to the plane and shot it down was sick
One single map though? Seriously? What's the deal?   This is like 25% of what it should be.. This is a joke.   Quality stuff. But no where near the amount of content to keep this came playable for an extended time. This is like a weekends worth of replayablity.   This game still isn't worth full price. . . save your money folks
When the the trailer is better than the game, they have a real habit of doing this until it came to battlefield 1
this is battlefiel
OMG Dice is releasing a new Battlefield game yeahhh. Oh wait it's 2042, never mind back to Battlefield V.
No one cares any more, just give us our refund!
I bet that guided rocket does about as much damage as a sundance grenade does
제발 영상만큼 게임만들어라....
this reminds me of the scene from Austin Powers. Dice you just don't get it do you, yous don't............
The look of this game had so much potential. sadge
I wish I could see the dislike number 🤣
Quick ! Use the transformers sound effect again cause it sounds cewl!!!!
godammn man these trailers are scripted
Just remaster BF4 and be done with it
Looks can be deceiving
Zero hour or zero content
why is there a tank inside a building at 0:49, is there no safe place for infantry combat?..
Imagine if they did not removed dislike 😬
All these “updates” and the kill feed is still broken
To late dudes
I have a ps5 and a $3500 tv doesnt look anything like this
I’ve stopped in January! Should I try it now?
Meh
EA/DICE are so unbelievably lazy/incompetent. After dragging the community through the mud and giving us nothing for 8 months, we get one map and 2 weapons. This is just sad.
This game & company is very dead the first season  After 9,8 months 🤣🤣💩👎🏻  jajaja
Might as well make the battle pass free. Not a lot of people are gonna play this
this looks sick!
BF Fans: Your maps are too wide open, empty, & have little destruction, detail, & aren't very believable.  DICE: Here is a map literally called Exposure. It's wide open - exposed lol - and has a super villain style lair. All built into an indestructible mountain.  BF Fans: Did you at least get rid of specialists & bring back classes, like everyone wants?  DICE: Meet Lis.
最高！
mfw new weapon is just a portal weapon
Angel does it again!
How does this have 18k likes in 5 hours?!
1:05 this game is so badly optimised not even the the pc from dice was able to record it in 60 fps.
128 player Breakthrough is back? Nope. Only 1 Map? Some specialist IDFC about, Then Im not interested. Never will buy a BF game again.
I wish I could see the dislike ratio 😂 this game is avenging the Infinite Warfare dislike trend
It’s too late for this, your unbaked game is going to be demolished once MW2 releases. Your only “delaying” the inevitable.
No Origin or Steam sale for 1.0 launch? A missed opportunity
Everybody hating on the game just do it cause it's the popular thing to do. The game is improving dramatically. It's obvious that release was rushed, the game is actually really fun now. Stop being bandwagon haters
Specialist still in game? okay, wont buy the game
DICE you need working for game stability and lags
Way to many hackers still.😠😠😠😠😠😠
TVmissile！？
2 helicopters, 4 guns, 1 new map, and another specialist no one wanted, 7 months and we still gotta wait another day cause they wanna run an ad campaign
I just don't care anymore 😪
RIP 2042.💩💩💩💩👎👎👎👎
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still, Damavand Peak is better than this. 🙄
We need proximity chat, to be able to speak to non party players in vehicles, or objectives.
Could have been awesome but I aint wasting any more money on that mess.
Is not my battlefield
Basically by the end of 2042s post launch content we will still wont be at the amount of launch content bf4 had
Pity nobody's actually playing it.... Everytime i go on just sat waiting to find a game, then back to the main menu, then sit waiting again... Hhmmmm end up just turning it off..... Shame really....
imagine having a FPS shooter in 2022 with 4 AR in 8 months since launch thank you DICE to make MW2 even better before launch
You guys just good with videos but games in last 5 years so baaaad .. I don’t know how you start season 1  without fix frames and performance!
22k dislike xD thanks youtube vanced
i miss battlefield 3.......
Bring back the dislike button
I want to know why this season got delayed though.. like 2, guns and a map?… You serious
Don’t know how you guys got away with releasing an incomplete game. Should’ve been fined by the Government. Straight false advertising
🔥🔥🔥
More gotcha gameplay to showcase a shallow experience.
The only solution that Bf2042 could save would be a class system, which the specialist are like heroes (like in star wars battlefront) and the old skool class system as average soldiers.
I have a hard time believing people will give it a second chance
Я увидел каналы ? ))))
It's....a start. Albeit an immensely late one. I'm for it.
I'm mildly encourage.
That grapple hook shot onto the jet was pretty awesome. 👍🏽
Incase anyones wondering, the new content is 1 new map, 2 new gadgets, 2 new weapons, 1 new specialist, a handful of cosmetics. Nothing else.  Theres your content after 7 months.
The Trailers are what DICE is best at ... currently Hope that changes in the futures
One map??? Really???
Dice pretending nothing happened before 🤡
“Battlefield 2042 Zero Content Premier”
You guys should get rid of the specialists and just let people create their own character . Add a ton of clothing options .
BT4 - 2013,  BT 2042 - 2022  years of degradation of good game series in one   perfectly polish trailer  - cheap chose of  weapons, vehicles, map-1,  one operator that nobody want to have, and probably gameplay with "some kind of errors". Thank you EA just kill DICE as other really creative companies you had.
battlepass? sorry is this fortnight
Maybe when this is free to play i will give it a try
I forgot this game even existed after what happened…..I’m being honest I did give a second try only to uninstall it after 30 minutes……and this isn’t even convincing me to give it a 3rd try
lets give everyone a TV rocket.
get rid of specialists you losers, listen to people at least once in your life
Bring back Premium Pass, when battlefield was actually battlefield and we were promised 4 Maps, more guns, etc per dlc. Thank you guys for wanting everything “free”
The helicopter has no weight, Has no momentum, and seems weightless,
This game is why they hid dislikes
1 map 💀
Dislike
The bots about to go crazy for this
The worse Battlefield ever
Shame your game isn’t as up to snuff as your trailers. Give the people making these a raise, rest of y’all need to be kicked to the curb.
Man, the name Exposure really does describe how much sunburn we are going to be getting exposed to.
should we be impressed?
Dice i got deceived by a Trailer once before, and here i will be playing on the 9th hoping that my favorite FPS redeemed itself after 7 months of patience.
I like how we used to get 4 maps and at least two weapons for 15$ in battlefield 4 and now I basically payed 10$ for 1 map and a crossbow and one rifle + a „legend“ no one wants
8 months for 2 guns
اول عربي واقول ديييييم🔥😂
It gets harder every time to see how brutally they ruined my favorite franchise
We need a refund, they stoled us
bf zero hour kinda reminds me of C&C generals Zero hour.
хахаха везде сильные и независимые ))))
REDEMPTION !!!!!
I beleive in dice if not season 1 they will bring back 2042 in season 2
Well they are trying, but i think its too late for this game......
2 guns and 1 map for 8 months of work...
Hitmakers ???? in 2042
1 map haha what a failure of a game. hope the 400 people left playing really enjoy it
Empresa maldita, conseguiu destruir meu bfzinho
So I'm assuming performance issues are gonna be fixed with this release? Cuz I want more than 40 fps on low graphics
Hmm......I see considerable fps drops in the trailer's gameplay footage. What can be wrong DICE? Do you happen to know? 🤡🤡🤡
Meh....the BF4,BF1,AND BF5 trailers were wayyyy better. These ones for 2042 are just alright.
Soo... pocket predators ... nice xd
This trailer is so buggy with heavy frame rate drops it looks like it was fan made 😂
Dead game lol
looks like they disabled the dislike count  as it is about to overtake the like count.....go figure.
Bro if the game runs bad just get a next gen console lmao it’s not that hard
👍
this map looks pretty good
Why is advertising better than a game?
This looks amazing! Just wish it existed. Yo devs working on these trailers, please break off and make your own game. You know what we want.
So looks like still no cover for infantry and map shaped for helicopter to have fun... THEY UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
What's the name of the game in this trailer?  Because it's clearly not BF2042
0:28 Is it me or the heli is with a different skin here
The trailers are always awesome
😴
The trailers are the best parts about this game. At this point i wish it was all just a really dope Campaign experience or had a Campaign in general.
Its so cringe to se a female soldier in any game.. its just aweful.. especially when they force feed you
Looks awesome!
I mean, i looks really good.  🙃
"EA does is again" sadly...
6 months for one map, thank god I stopped playing all together
Tone finally feels like it should have at launch. Guess I'm coming back to check this out.
Wow, the bots are getting good at acting for these trailers
should’ve had a levelution before and after the landslide
2 guns, 1 map.......wat a joke. No wonder dice lost interest on battlefield
I've done my part and left a dislike
0:02 gave me early days of DayZ Nostalgia
Ставлю лайк за хороший трейлер, жаль что сама игра разочарует.
Zero Hour with Zero Content (!)
I still think this game has potential but it probably wont be good until a year or more thats if they continue working on it.
Need to get rid of operators all of them, more destruction, more weapons, more maps, overhaul the graphics. This game is an embarrassing failure
The last Battlefield trailer turned out to be a complete lie. I have no reason to believe anything in this trailer. There is no reason to trust DICE or EA. I'm not wasting my money again.
This is all? Respect! This was my Money worth 😂
I really want my money back please
"Zero Hour" is the amount of time I'm gonna put into this
The crossbow is the ek archery R9. Cheap but very practical crossbow. It is sold in the US under a different name, the coldsteel cheapshot
Us: Ok, will see  EA: We're in the endgame now
thats more like it
Why does it feel like it sorta "slows" down time-to-time? Like it's not stable fps and it's struggling with poor optimization?
Good thing that you can't see dislikes anymore amirite?
what is dead cannot die
Wow. Certainly the best gameplay trailer I’ve ever seen. They really outdid themselves! Can’t wait to play it!
Season 0.25: Zero Effort
This is probably all DICE and EA are good for - cinematics and trailers
You’re wasting time, money, and effort making Specialists. Nobody wants them. Just make a gadget and let us unlock it. Maybe then you can make a better game.
Wow one new map😱
Let's ROCK!
Luunchinggg missyleee
Nope, not enough to bring me back to Battlefield, sorry!
Can we have DLCs back? I don't have time for playing the game for 200 hours to get the Battlepass finished.
INJUGABLE  ABURRIDO ERRORES DE CONEXION NO TIENE NADA DE BTF4 NI BTF3 ...... NI GRATIS 💩💩💩💩💩💩
“Unleash the unexpected” hopefully they do too
Delayed 6 months for a few guns, one map and a fee vehicles, god bring back dlcs
Imma check this out when I comes out and ilyk how it js
Content where?
You know, i read all these comments, and I can't believe that the actual game is as bad as people say. I'm amazed and excited by the trailer that I even thought of buying the actual game.
One map, seriously...
CANT WAITTTTT!!!!!!
"Unleash the unexpected"... unless you've been paying attention to any of the leaks over the past 3 months
This game sucks...
The Trailer is awesome. I think Battlefield is back in the game with this Update. Finally!
bring back Premium System (after you make a good game)
Is it a 128 player map again?
Zero content
Doesn't look like much honestly... What a shame... I still regret the 100 bucks I paid for this...
yeah, no.
the trailer or animation team should make a mini show or movie like this
I won't get too excited until I see for myself
C'est moche, c'est nul, vous avez trahi votre communauté.
7 months later after the worst game in the franchise, and this is the best you could come up with?   Pathetic.
Zero interest
I guess the only way to go once you hit rock bottom is up
Z time
No, I am still thinking that you just create a trailer. After lunch bf2042 trailer the better idea is to close EA and take money from that guy who was charge of this way of push the raw game in the market. I was really respected you guys, play bf2, bought bf3 and bf4, waiting something at least like bf4. But... You know losing respect is too easy then bring that back. Good luck, no offence but I don't believe you any more.. unfortunately (
Maybe another season and we’ll get close to the content at launch. Maps still look lacking in cover and the specialists look broken with MORE anti-air capabilities like we needed that when everyone spawns with stingers or rocket launchers.
Dear DICE, please, can you make mode with maps, vehicles and weapon from 2042, but without specialists? It is the main reason why I hate this game.
Nice Trailer! We'll see about the content tho...
To quote the days of Battlefront 2: "Dead game lol"
Sorry, it is not enough.
WE NEED A DOWNTOWN CITY MAP!! I hate all this open space bruh!!
Like us Flybros needed more AA..
Nice trailers but little quality in the game🥶🥶
i will give it a try, but I don't like games where you have to spend a whole magazine to kill someone. Way to arcade for my taste.
Waiting for the huge update.
I think it’s hilarious how all the leaks were right, map name, map details, etc lol
Just Ratio
Reportense Despat LATAM 😎💪 👍 👇
This was pretty dope hopefully it plays as good as it looks
The trailers are not even reflecting what the game really is like.
It's amazing how DICE wants to keep specialists. Keep alienating your fanbase. Maybe next year they'll realize no one wants this generic and uninspired trash.
And another game with a battlepass… onyl difference is that this one is 60 DOLLARS
They put more money into a 2 min trailer than they did for the new season
RIP Battlefiled. THank you for the memories. I loved you
People, Battelfield 1 is still open and active, you guys should join us instead of playing this dump.
but i dont want a new specialist
Now lets just hope the real deal i just as good as this trailer. I mean they cannot make the game worse at this point right???.....
Thanks Dice, I'm glad to see new content and continued improvements.
almost 9 ago,  1 new map. serious?
Monkey 1: Nice that you play bf2042 Monkey 2: Where destruction?
fool me twice shame on me.
It’s almost creepy how amazingly good they can “make this look”.
No one cares because you’ve failed two games in a row
So, everyone that purchased BF2042 at launch or at least months ago will be given season pass for free, right? It’s the least EA could do after all the bugs, bad press, long delays, etc🤷‍♂️
You should have remained on battlefield 5 and delayed this game for another 2 years ..
I hate how these trailers make me feel and then when I play the game I feel the complete opposite 🥹
Nah, I'll keep playing Deep Rock Galactic...
Goodness you and your specialists. BF is a game where you become a soldier in a massive scale war. Do I have to tell you this Dice? At this point, I don't know if you really have no idea or just trying to say "F*** Y**" to your players
LOL
To little too late.
Been a Battlefield fan for 17 years. BF5 showed the series going the wrong way with cosmetics and specialists and now we are here in some fortnite inspired warzone that doesn’t feel like a battlefield.  Thanks dice/ea for ruining one of the best gaming series in just 2 games, for a cash grab.
So this big zero hour addition is 1 map, 1 operator and 1 vehicle….? Guess Battlefield made enough money off this game. I wish I returned it when I bought it.
Battlepass better be free or they're gonna have everyone laughing HARD.
I still just want classes back, like just throw the specialists into a story driven PVE If they want to just keep doubling down on it
Will this be part of the year 1 pass?
I love the trailer, but I feel a user guided rocket... bruh, thats gonna be spammed unless its nerfed heavily
Still unplayable on a 3080ti :(
season0 zero player
servidores vazios aff
Zero players
ok they already have the trailer just have to revive and leave it with a number of stable players for at least a month I'm not going to be demanding
I can already tell that TV missile is going to be brokem and helis are not gonna be playable.
🎉 finally
I still hope and pray that we get Metro reintroduced.  I miss my meatgrinder map.
What is the soundtrack Dice? What is this? What is this?
Fix game pls
I might take off from work that day
We got from alpha to beta boyss
Best trailer making company ever!  But this time I know the game is doodoo.
I like how it showcased how over powered the new heli is going to be oh well  At least we have a rocket launcher to try and shoot them with 😂
This battlefield does not exist
The trailers looks nice and this is the very moment where the scepticism kicks in.
Too little, too late.
R.I.P Battlefield
they showed Caspian,kaleidoscope and canals cause zero content
this is what ive been waiting for 🙏🏽
Yes this is how you use the battlefield theme!!!
I can’t wait for the Battlefield game that this trailer shows to come out!
I’m in.
BF is dead. They've been alienating the OG players since the very first BF for quite some time now. It's a no for me, dawg.
so glad i didnt buy this game
7 months….1 new map. That’s it.   At least we got an awesome trailer.
Its more like battleduty
😴
Can yoi guys make crossplay console vs console and not console vs pc?
Bro it looks like phone game
What a failure this game is! It's horrible.
Boycott Battlefield
Waiting for this to gloriously flop day 1. I bet this game still won't have destructible environments.
Imagine if this was a campaign... Would buy in a flash!
Only one map !!
1 solo mapa después de tanto meses 🤦‍♂️
Fake video !!! Just for money. Trailer is not real.
They just need to remaster BF3 and BF4 that’s it leave it alone
Someone with the dislike count enabled, wanna post the number for the rest of us who can’t see?
1:33 is that a scream from like bf1 or I'm I tripping?
1 map, 1 gun, 1 side arm, a specialist that no one wants and no real portal support. Wow good job dice.
Until the specialists are gone, im not spending 1USD or let alone playing the game, do whats sensible
can I get my refund now? It's been 8 months already
Anyone else noticing how BF starts their trailers by jumping off high places simultaneously with everyone like in BF3's Damavand Peak map and the 2042's Breakaway? I mean the concept is pretty cool, but I just find it a little funny to take note of.
I wonder what parts of the map as seen on this trailer will actually be lifeless & useless.
So the grapple is finally gonna attach to vehicles? Good
Better than cod’s trailer contents
Battlefield 0 Destruction.
Every time i see a trailer for this game i genuinely get confused how they messed up so badly
wished i could see dislike ratio. I would have loved to see how much it had
all we wanted was BF3/4, but we have unfinished product with LGBT operators to fill game same as with Siege...Time to fight pony with rainbow pops tickles
0:02 i can see exactly battlefield 3 damavand peak map...
Seven months later…
Dead gamw
please make a battle royal version - just copy+paste Warzone, I promise you it will save the game & the whole franchise!
Почему вы трейлеры делаете на 10 балов но когда играешь в это думаешь что за говно??? Почему так???
Bring back classes.
I’ve got a bad feeling about this…
Loooooool 90 euro cash grabbers failure of a game actual franchise killer andys
This map looks real nice wow
wow! will be amazing 40fps experience.
oh look it's jumping off a mountain again. find something new.
dead game
*NEW SPECIALIST JUST WANT WE WANTED* 😍
No..... Just NO!!!!!
The fact that so many people are giving DICE & EA the benefit of the doubt annoys me. This game honestly needs to die
Trash
Game so messed up that they just now made it to season 1 lmao
Guys honestly don't get fooled, just stop playing.
Why is there no menu music in the game? Why do you still keep '2021 Electronic Arts' in the opening screen? It writes 2021. Are you there? Hallo, Sani Teta?
If only the base game didn’t suck
They should call this game Betacuck 2042
Fix the game.
I still want my money back
Thanks anyway, but i still prefeer Battlefield V 💓
At least they are good making training, gotta give them that. But we all know this is not the game lol
Looks awesome but then again all the battlefield trailers look awesome
Battlefield™ & DICE, hope one day you made game with realistic weapons how Infinity Ward made on Modern Warfare  please make weapons with recoil = realism
I'd be very surprised if those likes are genuine
The map is looking sick
1 map i 7 months🖕🏾😔🖕🏾
Someone else took over gameplay other than floppy?
It's dead! You killed it, it's dead! Not just the game but the entire brand! Stop trying to revive it, you won't fool anyone anymore. Go bankrupt for the love of gaming.
This looks pretty good
That trick shot at the end is actually insane.
Battlefield 2042 zero hours played edition.
Nice to see that the gunplay and weapon handling still look as stiff as a steel rod.
Gotta love 'em trailers
Too little too late
Remember Battlefield 3 soldiers screaming and swearing like their lives literally depend on it? And ofc they were in the middle of combat. This soldiers act like they are having fun in the biggest conflict humanity has ever faced lol.
Nice
Thanks battlefield for dropping this trailer so it reminded me to unsubscribe. Only annoying thing is I remembered this game exists
It’s been 7 months since you guys last uploaded, 7 months. All that hype just to lose it all and try to gain back you’re loyal fan base buy having them spend more money on a broken game. Either give us season 1 for free ATLEAST for all the busllshit you put us though and completely going silent on all of it or expect nothing cause I’m sure as not spending a single dollar on you guys anymore.
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZero hour
All the wait for one map  a few new weapons and another operator even though we don't want operators in the game 🤦‍♂️
Should have released the game in its current state. It’s a lot better than what it was 8 months ago-practically that time has been a beta phase to actually make the game playable. This looks amazing but for what the game has already been through it’s a waste of time.
So 9 months after the game came out... cool
I have been enjoying BF - it could've been a lot better in so many ways - but hey, this is what we have, let's try and make the best of it for now. ✌🏻
Dice Please more close Quarters.🙏🙏🙏🙏Also Spind Or Metro.🙏🙏🙏🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻🫵🏻please no More Experiments please 😬Thank you🫶🏻
Lamentable,otra vez...un mapa?una pena ver a Battlefield así...
Specialists were a mistake, one I hope you don't repeat.
I saw a lot of running around and very little interior spaces or buildings at all. Trailer=7/10, Expectation=3/10
I don't care
I wonder how many tries it took them at the end to grapple the Jet and blowing it up mid air 😅
I might come back when bf2042 comes to game pass, keyword being *might*
боже блять! даже анимация хуже чем  в бф3! ну ебаный свет как же можно так запороть прибыльную франшизу даже блять в трейлере! бф 4 лучшее что они могли сделать! (ну и бф 1 тоже норм но на любителя) Спасибо ЕА вы идете нахуй очень ТВЕРДЫМ путем и верным направлением!
i like how all the jump cuts and edits in the trailer kinda emulate the stutter in game
Seems that trailer's DICE know exactly how to do it
The best trailer maker team of all the gaming industry. Somehow manages to get us hyped even with 2042.
Hhhhh it’s a joke apex legend mobile trailer is best than this trailer and you said that some images not actually in game footage well done 🤣👍🏻
Word of advice: Don’t buy the Battlepass.   We’ve already given them more than enough with what we paid for and what they delivered at launch.
Season 1: Zero Content
TWO GUCKING GUNS
Mmmmmmmmmmm fiiiiieeeeeld
🤮
Okay so maybe fix the game and add more vehicles. 1 jet in each team is way not enought.
Okay so maybe fix the game and add more vehicles. 1 jet in each team is way not enought.
I loved the trailer, will give it a shot but I am not hopeful for the game ☹️
redemption arc?
one...New...map....
a reskined portal gun....and a cross bow....*Request Refund for Season pass
Ya know i was considering redownloading this but nah y’all kept the specialist… they ruined the game
There is very little content, especially for almost a year of development, only 2 new weapons, 2 helicopters and 1 map, despite the quality of this content, it is clearly not enough to bring back old or attract new players, it is a pity that such a conceptually interesting game suffers from a shortage support. I would like to believe in battlefield 2042, but if at least in the second season the abundance of content that players want does not appear, then the game will most likely lose the remnants of its online
I just needed a BF4 remastered with modern graphics and new maps ... not to reinvent the wheel in a square shaped form
Still trash. Deleted this game 1 month after it came out and still not downloading it back
This is more like the BF I know and love. I like the direction they're finally taking.
Woahh a dlc named after the amount of time I’m going to play it
But can I play as another non-binary character?
과거 배틀필드3,4의 예고편을 많이 따라한 것 같네
"Not all images appear in-game" 0:04 I'm gonna go ahead and guess this means that almost everything we just saw is either not gonna be included or we'll end up getting it a couple updates later.
This is a nice hat for the warty, dead hog that is battlefeild 2042
No pistols? There's 3 in game
Make it free-to-play
I just played a bit since the latest update and it feels much better on Series X. I was able to track moving targets without the opposing magnet effect and effortlessly climb ladders and it just feels much better. Thanks for keeping at it. The addition of older Battlefield maps is awesome. Keep it up. 👍🏽
lol
Season 1 is only coming out and I traded this mess of a game in months ago 🤣
I will consider the game when classes are added back.  Keep Specialists as sub-classes if you want. I liked sub-classes in BFV, and I wished that system was expanded further. But classes are a must.
The guy who makes these trailers should be choreography action movies.
More helicopters.... really?
Battlefield 2042 before launch: 128 players is the new bee’s knees! It’s the #1 reason to buy this game!  Battlefield 2042 now: Umm, we removed the 128 players matches but you can grapple hook planes now!
People talking looks, I just want the know the gameplay. Is it bad broken or is it terrible? Dont care too much about graphics.
One map and a few guns, this is truly pathetic.  Glad I saved my money
Mec on peut enfin grapin les véhicules ÉNEMIES BORDEL ENFIN !!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see y’all have committed to specialists. I guess I’ll have to wait for the next game to come out to get back to real battlefield. Nice bot video though.
Ouiiiii putain enfin ENFIN NNNNNN OUIIIIIIII OUIIIIII
add bots and i would buy this for full price. i want 64v63 bots + me
No jueguen asi con mi corazon :(
I do remember them saying that they would release content in the summer but did they actually fixed 90% of the issues in the base play?
Mw2 trailer reveal tomorrow
DICE, releasing more core content will make you more money.
Aïïïïïïïïeeeeeeeeeeeeee  😱  this  trailer is so good 😲but why so little content ?  😭😭 need moreeeeeeeeeeee weapons 😭
ofc they need to trow in a battle pass in a still broken game, better put that energy into the game instead of a worthless battlepass. there better not be a payed tier of the battle pass....
The fact bf2 would still be live if not for this dumpster fire
one map 2 weapons after 7 months.......  you serious?
Even after this delayed content for BF:2042 the servers will still be dead! 😂😂
finally a counter to 600lb pilots
How about you give us our refund, EA?
Bro y’all failed when you released the game, there’s no coming back
Community: we really don’t like specialists. Can we have classes back  EA/Dice: here’s a new specialist you’ve waited 8 months for.
Hope this map is not a sniper field.
Even the fps in the trailer drops.
One thing is for sure, this trailers are EPIC
First scene? Battlefield 3 ??
what a garbage . goes home your rag☠☠☠⚰⚰⚰
Понизте цену мрази!
2042 is totally worthless
Why can’t the game be as cool as the trailers?
More Gunsssss!!!!
The most disappointing part of this Trailer....the comment section.  That is also the biggest problem with this game.
Task Force 141 put this game on shame once again
Oh boy! I wonder what's the Like/Dislike ratio for today!
my ears please, 1 minute full of bass fiesta 😫😫
The TV missile specialist is going to absolutely ruin this game. TV missiles are the worst part of BF4. One of the only good things about 2042 was that it didn't have them, but now they messed that up too.
CONTENT!!!!
Trailers always looking good... battlefield is the best example...
Ouchies me bois
Let's give BF2042 a Chance this looks Good
BF 2042 trailers are the biggest clickbait ever. They are awesome but the game is garbage
STRIKE AT ZERO HOUR~!🎶
One......  Map........ ONE MAP AND TWO WEAPONS......
Looks cool, but what's the point if the game is dead and we have no idea if there's more content coming in the future besides season 1? No way I'm not buying this!
Wait so no portal content at all..?
lets go!!!!!! cant wait!
Fire up the trailers for BF3 DLC's and cry...
El tráiler muy bonito... El juego pa' cuando es que es?
It's ironic how the vehicles are such a massive problem in the game, yet I feel like all I saw in that trailer were vehicles
Great trailer, but you've fooled me enough times. Still doesn't make me want to buy or play this iteration of Battlefield.
Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour
I'm ready to be hurt again
Ok wait, so 9 months after release they start with season 1 and give us 1 new map? This game is a train wreck holy hell, I am disgusted.
Screw the grappling and flying suits
Am I still gonna be fighting my twins on the other team?
Delete the ...king specialist Man !!!!!
Let's uninstall it together!!!!
After almost a year only ONE extra map!!!! Boring...
Still hoping for a refund, or class-action settlement...
I'm giving them a chance again. It looks promising
Looks like am again going to be just running from one base to another dodging attack helicopter's
Trailer was Garbo sorry not sorry
Still want my money back.
I’m excited can’t wait
Likes and dislikes man perfectly balance of all things should be
heck yeah! Guided missile now we need a one shot javelin
2 new weapons? In a game that has 20 total at launch? After 7 months of absolute nothing?
Love this game, though it has its (big) problems. Hope season 1 draws more PC players to the game.
And even more disappointment lmao this game is done out here
This costs right?
I lost my money buying this "game", I will never buy a EA game again!
At this point BF4 already had 12 new maps and dozens of new weapons all while actually fixing the problems caused by the terrible launch
unexpected = a functional game
Господи, какой позор
Legit need to get rid of the hero shooter aspect
EA that's a nice trailer. Excited for the new crossbow and new specialist! Let's hope the update rolls out as good as the trailer!
Battlefield 2042 season 1 refund edition 😂
fix the sprint animations already they look so bad
RIP
Zero hour you mean zero content.... Such a disappointment... Smh.
How many seasons will come?
More like Zero Players.
Not playing until they bring back classes
I like it
sorry DICE, but im not hyped!
1 map?... I really hate how they went the MP only route. The extra time they wasted on putting out a broken game could've gone towards a half decent campaign.
Zero Content this company is a joke
I still want a refund
They legit bring Kamov ka-58 black ghost?
still not buying the game no matter how good these trailers look you’ve disappointed all of they players in the last “big” updates you’ve had gonna wait for the feedback from this when it comes out and believe me i want to play a new good battlefield but not wasting my money
People before battlefield 2042 - remove f***ing operater.  Dice - we are working on bug fixing.  People after battlefield 2042 - give us season one.  Dice - here is your brand new operator. People - 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️😑
Is it just me or does battlefield 2042 feel very janky on console
Looks like Battlefield become serious now
I'm sure the playerbase (12 people) are excited about this!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This looks fun hopefully more challenges and things to grind
Look like good now
Man. This looks amazing. Too bad nerfing exist.
Here we go again 😂, another trailer but once bitten twice shy😢
Where is the dislike button?
Well I hope dice is proud....well done for nothing ....a crossbow 🤣🤣 exactly what we wanted clap F...ing clap
Круто.......
Well, i really hope this’ll make the game worth the buy. I miss battlefield and battlefield 4 jusr doesn’t hit the same anymore with the Meta having everyone doing the same thing
Way to little, way to late.
Love how vertical the map is looking, looks fun.
Is this it? Really? Just two new weapons and a smoke launcher? This an out of season April fool's joke? You had all this time, and this is it? REFUND us. At least the music isnt horrific. Imagine paying anything for this junk.
Worst Battlefield trailer yet.
looks fun. can't wait. will this map be in hazard zone as well?
I literally screamed laughing when he grappled onto that jet
This game will never live unless the shots are actually registered. This game can be fun, but why did y'all make it incomplete.  Use me as a dislike button, my gawd
Battlepass looks pretty good,but could you guys please add Obliteration mode asap🙏
So basically the Endgame DLC from BF3 from 3 years ago but in bad and with way less content.
So we went from 3-4 maps with new weapons and vehicles per dlc to 1 map and a bunch of worthless cosmetics... Not to mention we'd have had 2 of these dlcs by the time we got this one update on BF2042. Congratz DICE, you managed to make a game that makes Vanguard look like a masterpiece
The trailer is awesome, the game is awfull.
"vignette"
Running, flying and killed? Meh!
lmao now do another one two weeks after and actually add multiple maps and guns maybe like how games work remember????
2022 7th Jun - 7:37pm German time 15.532 up to 15.000 down votes... 2022 8th Jun - 4:43am German time 20.517 up to 27.000 down votes...
Wost BF ever, i play for 10 seconds and i quit the game.
When performance fix?
Yo that grapple onto the jet at the end was amazing
Great trailers for this game but the content is underwhelming, all players are gonna get bored within a month maybe less of zero hour. Waited many months for this hopefully it’s cool and hopefully the battle pass is too.
After 1 year we get… 1 map? Seriously ?
Not good enough
As a fan of battlefield, it's quite sad to see the demise of the franchise, this is poor content. Big maps dont work dice! small infantry maps work & lots of guns & attachments.
Yeah u guys a bit late, idk if anyone still cares
we can't see number of dislikes anymore 😭
So after 8 months this is the content update. I have to say it looks kind of small, 1 map, few new guns/vehicles......least they've added a full fledged battlepass instead lol
rip
Saw gameplay of it.  Sry...but the map is again to open on some areas. I thought they learned of their mistakes.
Trailer aja ngelag, udah mulai putus asa ya, make game play langsung
Nice trailer, but not enough to bring me back 🥲
Oh, right. I had forgotten this game got released.
Free to play please 😆😅
i wanna see how many dislikes these have 🤣
대가리 나는 깨지다
Battlefield 2042 Refund Edition.
people do not want specialist we want classes with roles
Not interested anymore 🚶‍♂️💔
randomly decided to jump on last night to see how the game is doing...  still glitchy and only enough players for one server...  but hey whats another 10 dollars for the fancy premium battle pass thanks EA.  we waited a year for a scoreboard... and a \wasting 10 more dollars for battle pass... that a year late. not even a free first season to those loyal to the franchise huh
Replace Specialists with the ordinary 4 classes - stop making silly cosmetic items for purchase - and focus on making some solid maps, including some infantry only maps. Then Battlefield 2042 might still become a good game. But yeah, fat chance.
The video has 14k dislikes. WOW!!!
"New weapons" just one new weapon... Truly disappointig for me being a player of bf2042
Uma pena o jogo já estar morto.
2 new weapons. I hope yall enjoy when every player when MW2 launches. This game is a joke. DICE should be ashamed of what they've become
I'm here for it🔥🔥🔥
Alright, that map looks good! Can't wait for the update.
Wack
I see a lot of players running an open area and a lot of tanks and planes gunning players in the open. As a boots on ground player running 3 to 6 mins just to get blown up by a tank or helicopter. It’s frustrating the game has like to objects that you can fight without being destroyed by vehicles. I understand people that love the vehicles enjoy it because they get to shoot fish in a barrel. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
Thought we was getting a new portal map aswell? Or is that the end of portal.
ZzzzzZ
Кто то еще верит "Красивой обложке" БФки?...
What was even the point of this? The game still looks trash, it’s dead bro, the map IS STILL LARGE ASF and the gameplay still looks exactly the same, such a disappointment🙄
No. Start from scratch and deliver a quality product please. It's been a while
Ok yeah it’s looks fuxking cool but isn’t the game still in a bad state?!
Yeah ok .
Досвидания BATTLEFIELD, когда то это было неповторимо.
😔
need to make a limited number of new specialist in the team.  this is too strong a Persian against technology
Bruh, one new map, two new guns and a new operator. Is this now Rainbow Six Siege?!
Trailer looks incredible now time to see if the gameplay holds up
Loving the low key update you guys snuck in. Now I know how many times I've killed a specific player, like the good old days. Excited for the new map.
For everyone who doesn't see the dislikes:       15,369 likes to 14,000 dislikes.
Bruh even the gameplay in the trailers have FPS drops
One map is all you can EA.
おおお✨
does anyone play the game yet ??
this is how they should have marketed bf2042 to begin with.
The trailer looks cool. But... did they fix the game?
Another specialist? Jeez you'd think they learn that we do not want Specialists.
why can't they put this much effort in the actual game lmao
Zero Content !!!
Might come back to 2042
People who make these trailers: gods Actual devs of the game: why do you people exist
You just need to make BF3 remastered, that's it
Genau am den Tag kommt der RS5 Coupe 2018 in Forza raus.
Why did the first game footage look so much better back then? This looks like an ad for a mobile game lmfao
Love it love the game and can't wait
Youpi
A little more cover
"new weapons"  .. two?
A love letter to the fans
This is cool and all, but since Dice is doubling down on the biggest reason everyone doesn’t play this game (Specialists) I’ll be waiting for MW2
💩
too bad I can't get a refund
Polska😍
Too late.....guys...its already uninstalled.....
This game SUCKS!
We should've got this kind of additional contents within 2 or 3 months after launch of the game.
No tank gameplay because they still dont last longer than 5 seconds due to dice making everyone an engineer specalist with a rocket and C5 *slow clap*
Please Infantry maps.
U want more weapons? No problem get the season pass.... FCKU give me muneh mentality.....
instead of hype I just feel sadness, so much potential... so much greed....
amazing !!! Lets gooooo✊✊✊
I'm willing to give it another shot.
WE NEED MORE CONTENT😤
the trailer has that old bf3 bf4 vibe too it with their trailers thank god
I'm just here for the children with nothing good to say.
Man I see it, I like what I see, I love Battlefield.. but I just have this sense of dread with everything they're releasing.  Think I've just lost faith.
until the specialists are gone, no one is coming back
Wrong title it should be: Saison 1: Zero content
I've never felt so molested as when I bought bf2042. Such a total let down. Insurgency sandstorm is where it's at now.
this is good
Back then, the players were uploading on YouTube some very impressive and creative only in battlefield moments. Now we can only see those in the trailer
The trailers are better than the actual game.  It's wierd but oddly ironic at the same time.
1 map , 1 weapon and 1 specialist xddddd
I have that magic power to be able to ignore everyone else’s comments and say that this looks good and that I had fun playing that 10 hour trial when the game launched. Thanks you !
The only way to save this game is making it f2p
Indian movie
Zero jogadores hora zero faiz sintidu agora😋
lost me at "specalist".
The bots'll have a great time.
Soo as they fixed the game,, and it really looks good with this new season, dont you guys think that we should give it a chance and stop buring the game that effects the entire franchise? Because it really seems good to me.
Where is the dislike button if I think back to previous BF season releases I always go excited now its like it like ........ if only the trailer team developed the game this still isn't a BF game it play like Apex feels like Apex
100 Tiers rewards. Interesting 🤔
...mk this isn't too bad surprisingly
UCAV CONFIRMED - I'M IN!
Lame
R.I.P Descansa em paz meu amigo.
Trailer remains the best part of the game.
Trailer looks good…but I’ll pass.
Been a long time since I Liked a Battlefield video. This trailer looks very promising!
Battlefield 4  is Best
Imma be honest with you guys   Looks boring af The maps also looks Not that cool
booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I wonder if buying the Battle Pass will fix the game.
14k likes to 14k dislikes. Big yikes.
So the new specialist with the "new" guided rocket its basically the same thing as the UCAV from bf4 (Which is btw one of the most hated gadgets in the game probably just behind the mortar)
Meh trailer. I can't even imagine how boring the game will still be
“Unleash the unexpected” well only 1 new map and 2 new weapons after 8 months is definitely unexpected
Refund when
Heyyyyyy this is a really good      Trailer that is all
This gets me so much more excited for the modern warfare 2 reveal 😂
Imagine being a clown who pre-ordered this game
This look cool if 90% even work
Why didn’t we get a battle pass at launch. The game essentially has no real progression system so I didn’t feel the need to play
If you are wondering, the video has 14,000 dislikes currently
Plot twist: the map is called exposure but it turns out it has lot of cover.
Well guys can’t wait to see you on MWll ✌🏾
аля Баттлфилд 4 на максималках)
Zero people play !!!! Jajaja
fkingh scam city
Dead game.
If you liked this trailer you are a double fool
Bring back 128 breakthrough
im not paying for a battlepass to get 1 new map, 4 new wepaons and 1 new veihcle. this should just be free, considering how awefull the release was
honestly the new map looks good and well covered
You know it isn’t real footage cause they actually had a full server
By all means, give foot soldiers a fricking TV rocket, what could possibly go wrong 😂
I asumme that the game is still unplayable on last gen consoles. Not hyped anymore
make the operators as elite units from bf1 and we golden
False Advertisement 🖕👎
Great…even more ways to make vehicles and aircraft useless. Here’s hoping that doesn’t happen, but being able to grapple a vehicle and use a self-guided rocket in a game where everyone can equip anti-vehicle weaponry seems like overkill.
Use me as a dislike button 👎
WHERE IS LOCKER BOTS
Ah I'm so glad I didn't buy this. Money well kept
How come nobody wears helmets in Battlefield anymore?
Si el juego fuese la mitad de bueno de lo que es el tráiler... Ufff
First person who says "dead game",imma shove jeep stuff in their mouth.
Whoever made this trailer deserves a raise!
where's our REAL Battlefield?
I actually had fun with the game when it launched, but with the broken gameplay, lackluster content, and immersion breaking specialists, I had to set it down. It’s hardly battlefield, but they could have at the very least released a quality game if they were going to use the IP.
相変わらずPVだけはかっこいい。PVだけ。 当初もこれで騙された
Too late. Far too late.
0:25    ВКС России.  Воздушно-Космические Силы России!!!               ВВС  уже не существует, с 2015 года! ))  Если исправите - будет очень хорошо! )                     Ролик красивый!
Battlefield logo turns yellow now?I wonder why,ahemm Cyberp- Ahemmm!!
Es pura cinemática no creo nada
BF morreu no Black Flag
Let's juts hope the learned something what they prob. Didn't
Why didn't they use "Great Wide Open" by 30 Seconds To Mars as background music. Would fit perfectly!
I'm either expecting it to still be horrible or be extremely good and they will actually surprise us, I feel something new in this one
i imagine the 10 guys still playing celabrating this
軽量化しろクソサイコロ
Look at all that OPEN terrain. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT FREE VEHICLE SPAM.
We made guys. We finally get out of the early access 🫡
If only this was an actual representation of gameplay.
Add metro to portal
Can't wait for June 9th when everyone in the lobby is Specialist Ewelina Lis, even the enemies.
We need portal content
6 months for 2 guns, 1 operator, 2 vehicles, and 1 map?
Just 1 map in 8 months.
good marketing, bad game
one new map? lol bf 4 had like 5 new maps 6 months after launch
I might try bf2042 again just to see how good this is
A step in the right direction. Still crossing my fingers we get an optional customizable “default skin” where we can use any operator gadgets so we don’t have to play as certain characters we don’t like.
I see you totally listened when we ALL said we don't want specialists anywhere near a BF game. Yet here you are trying to promote a new one...
Please update bf1 and add anti cheat.
6 month later
If anything is going to save battlefield 2042, its this season. There will always be people that come back like they did with no mans sky. No mans sky is a fantastic game, one day so will battlefield.   They must focus on the maps because they are so terrible its disgusting. No cover no nothing its just whoever has the higher ground wins like in Fortnite but you cant build your own cover.   In fps games its natural for hight to play a MAJOR advantage due to headglitches and angles.   Fr dice yall gotta hire someone that knows about these things and can bring it around and make fans happy, it will make a lot more money, long term. Thats how fortnite was so good, the devs were amazing and did almost everything the fans wanted. They didnt stray off the original game till recently. Why add specialists, they never had a place?   TLDR: If it aint broke, dont fix it, why change what already works?
The new map really "exposes" the lack of content.  Also, if the new operator has the SRAW-like thing as her gadget this means she can also have the normal rocket launcher equipped ? Good luck balancing this...
this honestly sadens me -  Because this looks great. its such a shame EA and DICE both are so insanely respect-less to all their fans. The want and the greed for money doomed the game, and now even if it makes a "come back" it will never be what it could have been. It's sad we cant trust the trailers.
Battlefield will never have maps as legendary as Modern Warfare 2, will it?
So instead of removing specialists you add a new one? Bruh
GIVE US BATTLEROYAL MODE!
2 weapons and 1 map. One of those is a DMR with perma 5x zoom and the other is a crossbow. Why cant we atleast get propper weapons people would use?
Battlefield 2042: Zero Content
This content drop needed at least 3 maps. Or two bare min. I’m tired of orbital and hourglass
Trailer: Wow amazing Actual Gameplay: We're getting none of this are we?
PUT in  TV missile in Helicopter Gunner oky and Fix game 😫 or I will back Play BF3 FOR EVER Thanks ❤️💯✈️ we want Chopper like BF3 EVEN MOVEMENT AND EVERYTHING ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
Battlepass 🤢🤮🤑🤑🤑 look BF3 prémieum
zero content only in battlefield
It took them 7 months to make SEASON 1 dlc pass what a joke this game fail big time and even if this dlc comes out is not going to make a difference
I click dislike, because I don't like specialist. I miss old classes and more weapons.
the 5 people still playing will find this pretty cool
Still waiting for my money
if theres a sale im buying this game. for 60€? no.
Battlefield ⚰️ 🪦
Probs to the Guys that make these Trailers!
Too little too late.
Good trailer bad gameplay
So just one map?
Generals zero hour 😢
crossbow 🤤
When free on ea play?
finally a *battlefield* trailer
Как вы все заебали со своими арбалетами!!!!!!
I see you've added more trash to the bin. Dead game, RIP battlefield
Dead Game
This game is dead.
Stop putting characters in multiplayer. Just let me be some no name soldier. Not to mention the myriad of other foundational issues. So still not interested.
Fix the fxkin hit box i canot play this thing bro
2 armas y 1 mapa danos más por lo que pagamos esta saga merece más
that's it? 2 weapons, 1 vehicle, 1 specialist and 1 map, 8 months since the release and that's it for season 1
One map one specialist one new gun. Just make the hardest decision and get lost. You ruined battlefield DICE and EA and you will NEVER EVER get it right. Dismissed.
Let us spawn as the robo dogs! Hopefully with built-in repair tools! OR, customizable robo dogs that have classes, like repair, heal, resupply, and scouting!
just far too late!
Season 1 coming out!!! 10 players hyped!🔥🙄
If only dice was as talented as the trailer team, we would have had battlefield 4 5.0
Please new weapons 🙌🏻
Y si retomamos battlefield V mejor? XD
The name should be "Zero Content",   "Zero hour"  is more the time i will spend on this season,  keep staying on BFV.
pleaaaaase stop that, refund us and make a real battlefield !
I have Rtx 2080ti 1440p monitor and i99900ks what settings can i play this game? I am not flexing… i really want to know
Were is Skate 4 or Need For Speed 2022
In all honesty, after that abysmal launch and lack of accountability, this “dlc” or “season one” battle pass should be entirely free. If it’s not, no thanks
it's actually an excellent step in the right direction. 👍 what would have been perfect is the portal weapons also added simultaneously.
Yeah cool trailer. Just like the reveal trailer and portal trailer. This is meant to sell you a product and put its best foot forward. Like a tinder date that looks like a 10 but when you meet she's a 3 who's "working on herself"
Only 1 map? 😥 and what about portal? No new maps?
Nice try at making it seem like classic Battlefield, what with the Davivad'sp?' Peak base jump moment but as soon as the Specialists started doing their thing...whole thing that you were trying to do just got ruined..  We don't want flying squirrels, nor do we want Just Cause grappling hooks onto vehicles...we...want...Battlefield.  You know your new map is garbage when most of your trailer is taking place on other maps...even BF3 maps..  You can polish a dumpster as much as you want, still is a dumpster..
Where was this map on launch
looks good so far. If this came out like early this year this game would be poppin even with the bugs. We would be like in mid season 2 by now. I really do hope they continue this game for years.
Meehh
aw yes, alpha testing is finally over, beta testing trailer looks sick -_-
I'm rooting for you Battlefield! You're my all time favorite game. Keep up the good work
They never miss with trailers
100 tiers of rewards………… i just need 1 reward, a playable and fun game with content like maps and weapons, not skins😫
Okie this, didn’t disappoint
first 30 seconds is vechiles being op again 😒
Looks like Battlefield 4 Graphic and the map looks boring and to big.
This is not enough content.
I want the game from the trailer, not the game we actually get
Lol. Weeeeeeeeak!!!!
I wish y’all would take the specialist out the game😪😕
Was really hoping this would be them learning from their mistakes, so no more huge, empty maps with way too many players, no more focus on vehicles when only a handful of people get them and they're usually the ones who make them OP, and so on. And with how much they alienated the community, you'd expect the battlepass progression to be free to unlock.
remember guys. People making trailers do best jobs. But as we all know you cant do half of those things because game sucks. Only 2 guns? rly?
Hope
Refund
trailers they can , but that's all
Hope this map will be as amazing as in trailer
I'm never buying another Battlefield ever again
more dislikes.
Definitely going to be playing this!! I know most of the player base (like myself) is upset with DICE, but im just happy we're finally getting an update worth playing for.
I don't think this is enough to fix the biggest let down in battlefield history.
This stealth healicopter like "akula" frome gta online. Lol. What next? Opressor mk2?)
*it has 14.000 dislikes btw*
Время Ч? Серьёзно?
Was a rough start but hey, Noting less than perfection from now on EA.!!
What a joke.
hype in a dead game? no thanks. Fix your game first before making more microtransactions.
They could make this game AMAZING if they would just listen to the community and do what we want... the trailer looks great but will that fix the game? Nope.
Sorry, but as long as they advertise new Specalists I won't be coming back; give me bot skins! Let me choose what Kind if Voice I hear! Let me be a soldier in this war, Not a dress up model!
i’d rather play vanguard
Idk, even with disrespect. Will there be a chance that the developers gain any idea from the Russian invasion(or special military operations) 🤔
That's a hard pass.
Manga: The marketing. Anime: The trailers. Netflix adaptation: The game itself.
Refuns
A lot of hate since game launch. People who bought the game not even playing. Me waiting for EA to move BF2042 to EA Access since my 10 hour trial haha.
Refund
ah yes battlefield is coming back. Love the trailer, cant wait to play it.
Can you please have the jets in a separate slot so I can fly them?
Refund
PLZ....dont give me hope....
Хуета чистой воды
Finally the game moves on !
Unleash the unexpected bullet deviation
Oh man the A.I is going to have a field day with trying to traverse that new map 💀 I already know it's going to be janky
Still ain't gonna play this dumpster fire of a game. No matter how good the trailers seem.
14.000 dislikes. That just tells me everything about the state of the game.
I’m sorry but I genuinely do not care anymore
Can't wait
Meh
have they fixed calling vehicles on top of buildings e.g. objectives yet?
where is the cover on new map lmao 🤣
Just a reminder that this wont be anything like how the game plays lol
Well, MW2 reveal is close...
When does season 1 go live
Oh Battlefield… how far you have fallen.
yey one new map..... i still will not waste my money on it lol
Change UI....
Fake
Most unrealistic part of this trailer is the active server
1 map LMAO
Insane fps drop.
Lack of content is one of the biggest problems with this game and this trailer shows DICE have done nothing to correct that. Would've been better off buying Vanguard 🤦🏾‍♂️
So glad I have the season pass for one map and 1 specialist...... Can I just return the game now
this should be an apology to every person who bought the game and just be for free
Dice вас просто просили не обосраться.
This looks cool, hope you're not planning to disappoint us DICE
🤡🤡🤡
Battlefield 2042 it's so badly.🤮👎🏼👎🏼.. Battlefield 5 it's amazing😃👍🏻👍🏻
Nobody cares
Use me as a dislike button
Very underwelming
Cool and all, but can we play as the si characterd. Atleast they look cool
Wow I can't wait for one map 👍🏻🤪 one gun 🤪 one specialist 🤪
this looks kinda good why is everyone hating lol
Hello disappointment
この誘導ミサイル(？)でヘリもクソゲーになりそう
You cannot fix this garbage. No amount of fake trailers that are nothing like the game will change that.  Also, I don't know if I should laugh or cry about the fact that Season 1 releases a half year after launch, and all it has is 1 new map, 2 weapons and 2 vehicles
dust game
I want the 128 players mode back. Breakthrough was my one and only mode I would always play
You should hire the original BF:bad company team and let them do what they want. I miss the environments and sound of that game. God it was just *chefs kiss* when dumping mag after mag, belt after belt. Now BF feels hollow and like they didn’t care.
Any levolution?
Trailers looks so good BUT the actually gamepaly is trash and buggy
Let me get this straight... We are getting 2 guns, 1 of which is already in portal (the AS VAL)... Talk about zero content Also. Community: :we want classes with  generic looking soldiers, not specialists" Ea Dice: "Did somebody say they want a new specialist"
I will not be tricked again
so bad
How much reused footage?! 🤣🤣🤣
couldn't even give us 2 maps could they?......
Make it free to play.
Did they fix the fps drop?
トレーラー見る限りは神ゲーなんやけどなぁ
Still a very bad game....
It’s ok to let this one go. BF4 is still where it’s at 🤙🏻
Hopefully this can save the game
Oh yeah I'm about to be disappointed again
So im guessing the game will be less buggy now?
more like zero trust in your clownfiesta 2042
This looks really good Defo be back to check it out :)
1:34 oof 😂💀
Please sort out the optimisation. Hopefully it runs smoother
theres still hope 😭
What about the 100% destruction 😭😭
nice try but NO! No trust to you anymore. You are worse than EA games and Blizzard!
LoL battlefield is giving free advertisement to the game"Zero Hour"
Never seen a lobby so full - you can tell its fake
Indeed zero hours will be spent on this game
Why y'all even trying with this game anymore, just go back to updating BFV or something.
Not sure why there are so many dislikes, this trailer looks good. The hate bandwagon never stops I guess
I hate specialist because I can’t customize how they look, like maybe I wanna play as someone I can relate to not some action hero girl with a special rocket launcher
1 Map?... and then?
Ah the classic dice emergency protocol for a bad launch: Caspian border map type and a crossbow. In their defense it worked well with BF4
When you try to recapture the magic of Damavand Peak, but you realise it's still 2042.
Wow. The game looks really fun. Then I remember they bamboozled me once. Never again.
Now another 7 months until the next map
Enfin du lourd !!!!!!
yeah...no
For god sake just ditch "fortnite" specialists and bring back classes.
1 new map, 2 new guns and 2 (1) new helicopters (The same vehicle but divided and visually changed to the 2 factions) That's not much, to be honest, I expected more content for the 7 months they had for development.  Let us hope they changed the other maps and improved the overall game experience.
As much as I hate 2042 the new map and this trailer looks kinda good I’ll probably play it like once and then drop it again but for now it seems nice
the trailer looks good but I'm not falling again. 😒😒 maybe  one year for now things will be different, maybe. 🤔
I'm convinced that the only competent DICE employees remaining are the ones who make the trailers.
망겜 아니였어?
I feel like taking C will be the hardest point since snipers would shoot you from the top. Unless there's cover to hide in
It's a good trailer, not sure how all the open spaces will play out, once again.
let's hope the new map has more cover
2 weapons :(
Hopefully there is not broken glitch again
Trailer can you.....
After months of waiting only 2 weapons and 2 helicopters and one map added, do you really think that this game gonna rise with this silly improvement , I'm really disappointing and sad
Hi dice delete bots please . it is not cs1.6       (2042 )
7 months... What a trash game
I just cant believe how they manage to make such good trailers but then you play the game and well you notice..... hopefully they come back from the death!
How many more red and blue containers are we going to see?
Don’t play it , let them learn there lesson
Seems like a good step in the right direction. Hopefully later seasons come with more than just one map though!
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO
It's too little, too late DICE!
Map looks pretty hot to be fair. DICE lost its brain. Fingers crossed this update delivers, its make or break time.
seriously does not look good
Ah yes, another operator, female at that. “Girlpower will save the game” - devs
Oh wow look, all the same weapons we've had for the past year. Come on DICE.   Just so you viewers know, this video has just as many dislikes as likes. Get your dislike chrome addon and you'll see.
reinstalling rn
Still no change about specialist
Yeah but wait for the season to start and the bugs to pile up…
I mean it looks good, we will see
Won't get fooled again
Bro almost a year and we get what looks like 1 map and 3 new guns lol and they will charge $40-$60 dude what the actual hell have you guys been doing
"Zero hour"? More like "Zero content"
Pathetic
Seems like a 2012 game
Damavand Peak vibes
We don't believe this game for a long time
Number of likes: 13k Number of dislikes: 13k  *Thanos liked this*
Wow... Not enough content for a season pass... Yeah this felt very underwhelming.
Yeah trailer is pretty cool as usual but I think I would rather kill myself than buy this game.
2042 is the actual release date.
Wow, whole two new weapons.
Thank you bf2042💜
Cool helicopter 😎, I'll go get my hover car
7+ months in and this is the best they can come up with. Its pathetic.   1 new map, 2 weapons (1 being a crossbow which is always just a gimmick weapon on games), a specialist who can't can't take out vehicles easily and some more unbalanced vehicles   This does not make me want to play it again at all. 🙄🤦‍♂️
This should be free as an apologise lmao
idiot game
Whoop-de-doo! What does it all mean Basil?
1:12 Finalmente vou poder me livrar desses helicópteros que ficam atormentando a partida
A couple hours of paid content for a game you should given all of us refunds for...   You guy need to talk to Sean Murray and Hello Games to figure out how to reverse this publicity because this is not it.
Zero Expectations. Zero Hour Trailer drops. Zero Hype. Close to Zero Content.   How the mighty have fallen :(
I had to go back and see the bf3 close quarters trailer after this, to remind me what good content was a decade ago. 10 new weapons and 4 maps oh boy the ship sunk deep lol.
is it very hard to copy and paste weapons from protal to 2042?
Well...I'm glad I can still play BF2
Не, ну за русский вертолет - лайк
map looks pretty good
И это всё!? 🤣🤣🤣
Man I'm sorry but this game is trash. The maps are horrible everything about this game is horrible and I just want my money back. I paid $75+ for this trash and to be honest they should have just made season free for how horrible they made this game but even if it was free I still would not play this junk
There better be more guns then just the 2 I saw in the trailer.. because if so I'm definitely out
all they have to is release something complete it can't be that hard
At least they didn't totally abandon this game
that "new weapon'' is from portal lm ao
weapon customization needs to improve like it should also be like other customization of other games wherein the freedom gives you the benefit of extra attachments.
toooooo big map you don't understund needs of users. return my cash and our old school BattleField.
Cool, but I'm going to keep playing BF4
아 시발 연출만 믿고 다시 하기에는 맵의 크기와 타격감이 계속 마음속에 걸린다
The only thing they have mastered it in the recent years, is how to make a good trailer.
Weapon animations and movement (esecially that weird gun wobbling when sprinting) looks still like a mobile f2p game. So thx but no thanks Dice - maybe with the next game you put some effort in it. But i highly doubt that ..
very cool  this map remenber me davamand peak
Clearly they don’t listen to the community   FAIL of a game
Will never play it until they scrap operators or add a milsim generic soldier
This was disappointing
1 gun 1 heli 1 specialists 10 hours of content bruh
This actually looks pretty terrible. Great work guys 😁
What a joke 2 weapons after 7 months hahaha dice is kidding
Does anyone recommend BF2042 yet? the game looks kinda fun but it seems like there is not a lot of content.
Map looks super cool, just a shame we will ever only get to play Hourglass. xD I swear it is the only thing that pops up in any queue.
You guys gana remaster BF3/4 yet...
More like Zero players AYYYY
Shameful amount of content. Shameful!
Graphics looks like mobile phone
Bring back the good old classes and get rid of these cringe "specialists".
Hermosura
Waiting a lot of time, just for this 1 map 2 weapons???,  Time to change it, hopefully mw2 do better
I like how this trailer actually shows gameplay instead of some animated cutscenes
This dlc is the last chance for this game if this is bad then game will probably die
more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons more weapons
Game has problems but I’m excited!
Community: give us a refund Bf: no!!! Heres new content that we delayed for months
Did this game ever get fixed...? All I see is a cash grab battle pass, new maps and a new character
hope this will pay off the the ultimate edition I bought
この流れだとナイトホークもいずれ、、、
一試合毎に、違うサーバーに行くのがクソ！ それが直らなければずっとクソゲー
Refund us all and we call it even.
I've finished it long time ago, I've Zero Hours gameplay of BF2047
Will it ever run on PS4 or did I just throw 70€ out of the window?
Game is already wayy beyond dead just scrap this trash already
Dice give us the class back but keep in the specialists as well. Treat them like specialists from Battlefront II.
BATTLE ROYALE would be amazing!!! It will help it thrive even more  -from near future -'-
Lol. Refund please
0:05 now this is a representation of a battlefield downfall.
Only two new guns?? 😵‍💫😵‍💫
0:40 Oh no Spike LR
Is the new specialist being represented as an strong independent muslim lesbian?
This is the official we want a BFC2/BF3 remastered button   👇
D.O.A.
😍👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
That's not gonna cut it... I mean maybe those 10 remaining players will enjoy it, but nobody will come back for 1 new map, 1 new operator, some gadgets and 2 helos... So glad I didn't invest in this... Not sure if it's sad that this is all what Season 1 has, or a good thing that it gets something at all lol...
lmao no one cares, dead game
One Map, a single weapon, and a utility weapon? You gotta be kidding Dice. Completely embarrassing I paid for this game
not impressed in the slightst. i hope your entire company burns
They should make the battle pass free so people have something to look forward to. They would have to fix all the issues the game has tho Idk  how the games changed since launch hopefully some good fixes
It's something atleast..
Wow, the 7 people still playing this game will really enjoy this update!
But does the game actually run now?
Is the game actually playable though
Super
But does the game actually work now?
Wow ❤❤❤❤
the editor singlehandedly carrying the hype
Zero hour because thats how many hours most people will spend on this game going forward
Dead game lol
Yea I mean... It doesnt look terrible
It's ehh
Jajaja
Still specialists and no default operators? I'll pass
bro they used to release 4 maps as dlc back in the previous games. 6 months to make 1 map??
Zero map for portal? Huh...
only one more year for the next map...
Isn’t this also locked behind 40$?
I pre-ordered the version with the battle pass on the PS5, I also have the basic version on PC. I'm struggling on which version to play.
The return of TV guided missiles??? It may be a small thing, but that's still a thing to celebrate. So much fun slapping helicopters with them in BF4
хуйня 3-4 то что надо было неужеле так сложно было доработать то что и так работало пиздато?
Game still looks boring, sticking to V and 1, will play this for one day then uninstall.
It took you 7 months to pump out 1 map, 2 guns, a specialist, a couple of helicopters, and a smoke grenade launcher???? Oh but thankfully you've gotten all of those pretty cosmetics and microtransactions in orders. Really shows where your priority lies guys.
Is that one chopper with the red star on it the same stealth chopper from GTAV?? Or is that just me?
Looks sick tho
@ponylionhd where are you? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 HYYYYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
They say the map is good. If you paid $100 for this game you’re kinda forced to play it otherwise you lose the battle pass stuff.
Looks gud, maybe Il return..or wait till S2
I expect nothing and I am still let down
Pls  Refund - U guys are SCAMMERS !
On top of charging people $60+ for your broken, unfinished, game now you want people pay for a battle pass?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!?!
When are you guys going to fix the menu music?? No music in the main menu or loading screens or match intro for almost 2 months.
Okay battlefield. I see you now. I hope.
DICE better give this game abattlefront 2 level comeback and redemption
I just hopped on the game and realized the dead servers aren’t a joke 😂
Alright battlefield. I see you now. I hope.
Wow looks a little bit boring but I will give it a try. But great to see the great commercial for helis again. No way out, no way to hide. Even in a tunnel you will get killed from them 🤣
No way you mfs are still working on this
Solo  un mapa???? 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎  El peor battlefield
Ok i view Gameplay map,good map originality😀
Is this the leaked map supposedly based in British Columbia?
No new portal map?
Cool!
Hopefully more dynamic weather, floods & volcano talk will be mentioned.  Things we waiting on Dice dev's to talk about.
Not enough just two guns and one map with a mediocre battle pass very disappointed but I hope it gets better but for now still not intrested...
You guys at DICE suck so bad XD
This is the 1st time in the franchise history where I've been completely underwhelmed by a trailer. They really haven't listened to the fanbase. Anybody know how the refund petition is going on? I want my money back
nice try dice. but still no. just remake bf3 and I'll be back.
Everyone will be using the new weapon, that's gonna get old, fast... We need more than 1 new weapon 🤦‍♂️
It looks like they actually took criticism and worked it in? May be worth getting the game back
With NO SERVER BROWSER we gonna have to WAIT and keep CANCELLING loading of other maps? LOL what a disgrace.
world worst game studio = DICE
I want my $60 back.
I'm not disappointed, its hard to be disappointed when your expectations are as low as mine. Just 1 thing I don't understand - why do they keep adding old and phased out guns instead of new ones? I mean game had PP-29 instead of PP-19 Vityaz, now they add VSS instead of AMB-17... I don't get it, but, again, I care too little about this game to feel anything about it
I love how this is more like open world gives you more time to take in and analyze where the enemy is going.
Zero Content
This game could go on sale for 2$ and I would still not buy it
Looks like fun, I already watched the jackfrags video and he seemed to enjoy it. I hope this game ends up with more personality to it as the game feels very generic.
You know how to make trailers. I wish you knew how to make a good game as well.
Countless useless "patches" and "additions" have failed to impress anyone since launch. What makes you think anyone would be excited for a season with even more of these?
Oh snap all the AI are going to love this.
I wont lie this looks cool. Even if its little content I will just get as much fun of it as I can
Im sorry but I did like that gameplay/trailer. Wont dislike it, I see 12k likes and 11k dislikes
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑💩💩💩💩
too little, too late
I will likely try it out but haven't played since release due to vehicle dominance and extremely poor infantry cover on all of the maps.  Seeing the tank crashing through the office space of a building in this video made me want to vomit.  Let's see if there have been any improvements :/
we are back!!!!!
this mess happens when you care more about LGBT++---+-+-+-+---+-++++ than players
Battle Royale is what this game needs
Give us metro!
is this going to be one more megafail?
I’ve recently hopped back on bf and it’s been loads of fun this lowkey got me hyped yall😂
si que saben hacer trailers los cabrones
This game is dead, i dont understand, why you try to reanimate, players hate this specialists,this FORTNITE and WarZone style, it's disgusting to fight each other with the same specialists, imagine, the same specialist named in two teams, fighting against each other, horror, soldiers' models are horrible, decorated like business Christmas trees, shining with some lights and bright as they run, after all, you must discard of these disgusting specialists  , and bring back the classes of Russian and American soldiers, and many more things from the real Battlefield, this game is dead !!!!
I'm not gonna get too exited, but this looks really cool
I wished this game had the same comeback as No Man's Sky.
wow that game laggin in season 1 trailer xD its still alpha ? when beta come out?
I don´t like the vibrant color scheme, it doesn´t fit a realistic Battlefield game. Glad i didn´t buy this Haribo Shooter!
They can make another 1000 trailers and bring out new content, wont be buying this game.
cant wait for unbalanced new weapons that take a month to be patched aswell as the final cashgrab in form of 4 battlepasses this year, just so you can stop to continue the "content" for this game as the next BF is set to release next year already.. lol
12k Likes /12k Dislikes 1 hour in. Yikes!
This is a step in the right direction, hopefully we see more cqb maps too
If dice wants to release one single map per season, they should fix old maps asap. Like they should complete fixing all maps before this year ends. Personally, I don't think we need many guns like bf4 cuz we will use only few of them that are "good" guns. If maps are good, at least you can have fun.
another freakin empty map
Si chi troverò a giocare? Bot vi fate una partita? Ci becchiamo 🤣🤣
Give us normal classes back
Hmmm, seems promising, idk.
there are more players in this trailer than the actual servers lol
Well, ok, but season 1 is just about a single map, specialist and two skin for the helicopters ?
even to this day, everything thats moving looks like is suffering from rubber banding
hmm what happend to the tornados, they dont look  the same ingame ^^
Too little , too late.
Прикольно 1 карта за 8 месяцев.  еще 1 карта будет через год
Battlefront 2 better
Another cash grab content. DICE is only going downwards from now on. I appreciate whoever worked on this project but this is not going to work. Bring back core battlefield if you want to save the franchise.
50/50 likes and disslikes, take it or leave it
Again endless wastelands, again expanse for helicopters. The game has fallen to the bottom and will no longer be able to rise. Accept this curse already and close support for Battlefield 2042.
No dinosaurs?
I can't wait to NOT play it!
This trailer  S U C K S    Want to see a good trailer? Look at Battlefield 4 Legacy Operations
Doubling down on specialists, I see. Not interested.
nice trailer, but will the game be nice?
Can't wait to hear what annoying things she'll say ...
Battlefield community consultant “the players demand more variety in the guns they can choose!” Battlefield boss” haha we add weapon that uses bolt in more future game”
Rememebr when new content drops had 4-6 maps and not 1?
Specialist was a flop. But I mean at this point just give us some remastered BF3 and BF4 maps and we’ll be happy. I haven’t given up on you guys yet.
specialists ruined battlefield  why add more?
2022 and we have a modern-futuristic BF game again. I enjoy juggling BF4 & BF2042 both are FUN
Amazing as always, can't say that for the game tho
Little late for content when pretty much half of the player base is gone after how the release was received and how the game has been handled lol
I love the trailer but don’t trust the game, with how long the game has taken just to fix launch issues ima keep it on the shelf till it’s actually solid.
No change back to classes? You can change the game in this one simple way.
игру спасёт только репчатый лук, ибо без слез не взглянешь
Even such "cool" trailer shows game ugly graphics. I mean bf 3 looked better than this. Such disappointment. Map looks cool however.
Zero content
What did happen with you, before were cool...
Wie immer Trailer sieht gut aus und dann ist es Trash...sag nur die Trailer vor Veröffentlichung des Spiels...was die season hier bietet ist viel zu wenig........
Y'all need a free to play aspect like your competitors. It'll widen that entry level to the market place for cosmetics and and make for sustainable revenue. One is more likely to spend more money over a longer period of time when shopping/looking around the store is free. The benefits for membership need to be enticing.
2 guns isnt nearly enough, they're just copying the same methodlogy that MW2019 used for their battle pass content. The rest of the update looks good but honestly we needed like 10 new weapons to really draw back fans that turned away from the game
PURE GARBAGE
Honestly.. I'm pumped!
Ah so this is why YouTube removed the dislike button, to spare corpo's the public embarassment of their poor actions consequences!
I wish I could still trust you.
New map, stealth helicopter, new specialist with some remote controlled Rocket Launcher, and we even get a VSS Vintorez and Crossbow as weapons, it's not much for sure but danm is it actually pretty good
dead game
Can’t wait to play this map with nothing but bots!
How much of the new map is available on ps4
WE NEEEEEED SERVER BROWSER AND MAPS VOITING TO SWITCH BTWEN DICE
Zero Hours will indeed be put into this
1 (one) new map
I wanna see the real trailer Y'know, where the gameplay is a laggy buggy mess like it is rn
THIS DEFINITELY DOESN'T MAKE ME WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN.
How did a battlefield game in the future with all of the artistic freedom to get creative only launch with 4 assault rifles?
Been waiting for content for a hot minute
Refund us you morbins
We Never go have the Trigger Adaptive for dualsense 😕
make it free then ima give it a try
it looks soo bland. I don't understand what is going on whit DICE but this looks bad. No more words before it gets ugly
look like bf2042 coyping WArzone idea by keep update new season lmao
Trash as f 😫😫
Looks not bad but I still hate the specialists….
how to make a cool trailer with dirt; have all players be together in one place, shoot 80% of the trailer in one little area of the map, make it look like it would be fun. reality; its still the same base game with little tweaks here and there. conclusion; play the game when its on sale for $5 at the end of the whole year of promised content because youll watch them abandon because "we'll have everyone hands on deck for the next battlefield which will be amazing" wait why does that sound familiar....
The trailer and the music really sets the mood. The trailers are good but the game in the current state is trash. Let's see if this new map changes anything for the game.
Actually, looks decent ngl.
When the Trailers offer more entertainment than the actual game itself.
1 map? Lol
🤡🤡🤡
i actually want to sell my game....
haters gonna hate. game is fun now
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮  this is my reaction
Still waiting for my refund
This map reminds me of Monte Grappa from BF 1
Dear lord I can already see how buggy this will be.... The crossbow kills the jet? C'mon...
Oh great. Another specialist nobody asked for.
They started to make great trailer than the game itself. -_-
Im mostly surprised that the marketing team better than the devs are
Lets be positive about this
meh... I'm gonna stick to BF1
Zero Hour? More like Zero Players.
oh yeah, lets add more specialists and confuse the players with selection even more. well done EA
Community : "We dont like Operators, we want classes" DICE: "Hey it's a new operator!"
BF2042 HYPE
Love the game, and this new map looks AMAZING! 🙂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Помните что все это обман
if you buy this battlepass, you are part of the problem
This entire time for a map, specialist and a weapon…🤡
I hate anyone who buys this battle pass :)
Dice.. Grapple hooking jet is dumb, not cool
They shouldn´t add more unpolished "content" instead they should polish the main game. Can´t wait to run in the next open field as dozer
Good to see we're on track for early access beta dates should be fast approaching  "What a time to be alive!"
Gaming is finished
Always a lot of talk about x3 studios working hard… I wonder how many people in those teams are actually level designers and devs building weapons? We get the gameplay needed bug fixes and updates but these are not going to be done by the same people creating maps. One map and 2 guns is really little to show for 3 studios worth of designers… I’m sure more could have been done were it not for the looming spectre of a battle pass and specialists to monetise.
Say what you will about 2042, but Floppy Ragdoll always nails these gameplay trailers
Its shame tho there still seems so no shooting feel. No thanks. You ve already ruined experience. Give people money back. I was so lucky right after beta i decided to cancel my preorder.
there is an extension for chrome, called return the dislike button, now the video has 11k dislikes, you should install it, and this is one of the reason why they hide it, to censure even more the internet, very bad idea
And just when I thought this game couldn't be more disappointing
If only DICE made games as well as they make trailers.
We need  battle boats and battle ships! We need water in the maps to make usefull this missing vehicles in this game. In the past, they used to come with the game. Now they will be DLC stuff for sure :/
Can't wait for players to start beta testing the season 1!
1 map 2 weapons  Welcome to Battlefield 2042 Zero Content
🤡🤡🤡
let's see if this breaks the rock bottom and make this game dive into lava
lol ~2,000 concurrent players on Steam. This thing is DOA.
Boooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Er dont need „Specialists“ 😡😡
Wow, DICE, dig deeper for your own grave? Disband by EA, when?
game is still trash.
God I want this game to play out good sooo much but my hope was crushed when it came out so I have no high hopes really
Well…. I guess I’ll give it a try. Always been a die hard bf fan but this is the only battlefield game I only played 2 weeks of and stopped :(
بيض 🥚 .. اريد استرجاع اموالي من هذه اللعبة الغبيه
lol
Ewelina!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dice you make me cry ,and for half the trailer there is  fly Sundence...no way ,'wokefield '2042, are you sponsor by Netflix? Elon please buy the  EA games!!!
Meh. Just give my money back.
To little, to late
You've disappointed us all. And you continue to sit and smile as if nothing's wrong. What a embarrassment.
this game is a TOTAL failure.... should be ashamed guys...
Letdown
Epic trailer for the 1 MAP!!!!!
Wow. One new map and another specialist. .... Are you offering refunds yet?
The game has been out for ages now, and we get one map !? If you wanna save this game, release  more Bad Company Maps, and stop taking away the game modes all the fukcing time. This trailer kooks good though. but i didn’t pay over 1200:- kronor for a bunch of videoclips. This better be good or i will give up on this.
fortnite is better
Excited, give the game another chance honestly, it’s better that launch by far!
I can’t wait to rage quit when I play this game again and hate it again till the next session
Still got specialists? Nah, I think I'll pass.
めちゃくちゃ面白そうに作るやん
Delete specialists.
Refund pls
The map is good but just adding 1 map isn’t enough to bring more people back. I think DICE at least should put the remake of some of the old classic battlefield maps in all-out warfere to add more variety to the 64 players game mode, or I even think the 128 players could run perfectly as well in maps like Golmud Railway, Operation Firestorm, Siege of shanghai…
battlefiel les pido que mejoren el juego, si es por dinero eso llegara , pero mejorenlo es un juegaso mejorenlo plis
this trailer is looking promesing, it kind of took me back to bf3/4 trailers
😂😂😂👎🏽
Well, at least MWII's trailer is coming tomorrow
ليش هي بتلفيلد كبل مثل بتلفيلد هسة
… and the trailer gets views than the game play 😒
Dice ? You have to deliver now.
You've already made this series die. Stop adding stuff no one wants
*All we want is BF3: REMASTERED!*
Cant weit to get dissapointed.  Atleast they know how to make trailers that sugarcoat everything...
واو !! 🔥🔥🔥
They should take all the money they stole and make a free to play BR.
🥱🥱🥱🥱
this new Avengers is looking good
Will this game go on sale since new update?
Coming to check if anyone knows the song in the video?
BRING BACK THE SERVER BROWSER
神ゲーに見せるのだけうまいゲーム
I've played BF since the first one and I'll give it a shot every time - but I still have no faith in your product coming even remotely close to the action in the trailer.
8 months for that.. lol
😂 jokes
This better bring people back. I haven’t played since 1/22
Alright the last part is somthing i gotta try
I would be excited for this but then I remembered it's BF 2042.
Season one hasn't even started yet?!
In BF3 and BF4 there where literally 3 player guided missile launchers at launch that where gadgets to the engineer class lmao.  Y’all killed this game with the specialist. One thing I regret is paying 100 $ for this dumpster fire at launch
This was the map from the original trailer
Looks good
I want a refund
i Will continue to put zero hours into this game thank you for your service
Is this the title for how many hours were placed into this MEGA update lol.
God I wish youtube never removed dislikes
Battlefield "Zero players"
battlefield 2042 : ZERO PLAYERS
It took 8 months for us to get ONE new map and the start of season ONE. Let that sink in...
Too little too late.  Dead game is dead
We can only go up.
R.I.P на Х@Й
they are trying soo hard to fix the game, but they can't, they should just move on, and leave the game where it is.....dead
New map looks good. Also, specializer with TVG from bf2? sign me up.
The crossbow looks really cool
It runs butter smooth btw. Thank you dice for the update today.
Very disappointing, yet again...
The pre-release trailer was pretty good too...
Specialists is ruining the game.
cant wait to enter the queue 20 times to get to play the new map since we dont have a server browser or map filters in a AAA game in 2022
Видос зачётный )
Soundtrack name ?
While the new maps looks interesting, it also looks like Sundance is the only one that will really shine and we already concluded that she was too dominant...
One map?
Fake fans in the comments have nothing else to say than "hurr durr game bad"
Most disappointing overhyped game of the century
We still deserve refunds
Refound my money
Everything is fake
wait, how many new weapons?
Lets gooooo😍
aunque acepto que el juego no esta en su mejor momento este tipo de trailer que se lanza BF me hacen querer llorar y volver a jugarlo. Nos vemos el 9 de junio
O jogo é massa, pena q é todo bugado
This map has some damavand peak vibes
No espero nada y estoy desilucionado
One map after 8 months?
вы кроме открытого пространства, чтото делать можете? возьмите меня тоже на работу, не хуя не делать и получать бабки, тоже хочу.
This is your only chance to bring this game back if y’all screw this up it’s all over
Nope, nope I'm not gonna fall for it AGAIN 🚶‍♂️
everything was going great until "new specialist" and a 100 tiers pass
Meh.
One map nice 🤣🤣
this gives me hope that the game will rise from its ashes like the phoenix
missed opportunity should have made it free introduced two generations of gamers into your new season model BattLeFail Season 1
I'll wait until Ive played it before passing judgement... Great trailer as usual. But we know what the games like...🤔🤔🤔
Same excellent trailer but not in real gameplay. Please we want squad system.
Bring 128 players breakthrough back
Pra fazer trailer são bons, pra otimizar o jogo, esquece. Vou reinstalar o jogo só pra ver como vai estar.
Looks great.
Apex 2042 🤢
Took long enough
Looks nice just wish we got more content
Too much women
Is this apart of multiplayer, portal, or the battle royal thing???
Map reminds of Halo
Did people really wait almost 8 months for 1 map, some weapons, and some vehicles? Wow
I'm so happy to know that DICE and EA spent all their budget on making sure the gameplay trailers are the best that they can be over making the actual game the best that it can be, who could have asked for a wiser investment choice. Great job devs and publishers you are really making a difference in the Battlefield game industry. 😂🙄😒Or at least for the trailer side of things
I played Battlefield almost every other day since 13 years. Almost bought me the new Xbox because of BF2042. Lucky me I didn't buy it. I don't play anymore since four months. DICE, you lost a big fan 💔
Lost me at “New Specialist”
Finally new map
Gosteeeeeei
This is first park of the season 1 ? first part yes ? ?
Thats it ?
EPIC
This update is the definition of too little too late
You know there’s no content when the show more base game maps than actual new maps..
With all the promos, ads and trailers. It's much more better they make a movie. I mean. Yeah. Just my opinion though.
I'll just go out and say it... This trailer was 🔥 The game actually plays a lot smoother these days. Will be a great time to re-enter the arena and reassess the situation
Acho que vou volta a jogar.
I expected the worst and you still disappointed me 🙄
I remember the good old days during the bf3 dlcs
(ENG) Finally waited (RUS) Наконец-то дождались
Im back.. please DICE
I think 1 map and 2 weapons is not enough for the time you have had and the things we've been through with the game. The map looks great, but again, it seems to have too many open zones. But overall the season looks nice.
lol 1 map
Meh
Crossbows coming let’s gooo
Don’t get too excited guys. Look at how hyped the trailers got us for the main game. This should’ve been here at launch  Edit: After actually playing Season 1 for a good amount of time, its actually a lot of fun, but this is how the game should’ve launched
If only we could see the dislike ratio...
DICE, please. Just get rid of the specialist system and just put in the previous soldier classes like in BF4. It's not working out for Battlefield, because that simply isn't Battlefield.
All i saw is vehicles and helicopters. I thought they will reduce the number of it
Refund 2042
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💰💰💰💰💰💰
Is this a free game like warzone??
Soo Zofia is the new character??, What did Ubi do?
You guys got some nerve charging for a battlepass
Pero donde está toda esa acción en lo actual!?!?!?
If there is one thing that BF is good at, is making great trailers, I wish it would translate to the game though :P
Just make the specialist into skins and bring back the main four types
New mods? Domination? SC?
Season One: Zero Content
Anyone else hear that farting sound effect?
I dislike this already of all guns we could get they give us a heckin crossbow? Not only that the new specialist doesn't look old enough i got used to seeing old people running around on the bf map smh how dare they add a younger specialist
The stuttering 😂😂😂
they adding fat operators now lol. She gonna operate a mobility scooter fr fr
What happened to the 2 portal maps you guys promised for each season???
9,5k dislikes, we can do better boys!
Looks fun can’t wait. Can we get a hardcore mode or unlock upgrades in portal? Thanks
There will be more challenged weapons this season right? Because 2 weapons for a game that has close to none is just not it.  Map looks nice tho, hope it plays how it looks
Yeah I'm not really hyped here
Just kill the game already. Wasted development time
كنا نحلم بلعبه نتمتع بها لكن للاسف فقط تريلرات واعلام زائف
Battle pass? So you guys are tryna steal more money from me? Yeah right, screw that.
В игре появилась после нового патча куча невидимых стен, как минимум на карте манифест, и через отбойники некоторые не перепрыгивает, ps5
IM LADYGAGA1921 👽✌🏼
you know the optimisation is trash when even the gameplay trailer is laggy af.
Be like shroud just delete game and forget.
So, two helicopters that have been in the game since launch, a portal weapon and crossbow and another garbage specialist?
Lmao it has 9.4k dislikes and 10k likes, YouTube Vance shows the reality
Wake me up when there is destruction in the game like the battlefield once did. lifeless maps and no cover just look cool.
When does the kaleidoscope remake appear?
Хороший трейлер. Жалко, что игра гавно
People who think this "content" drop will help are delusional. way too little too late.
wont fix it
We still have input delay on PS4. It’s unplayable.
1:30 yes. expect the unexpected colossal of bugs
You added a new map before fixing the existing ones. Also this is false advertising because there were no game-breaking bugs shown in the trailer.
Gentlemen, I present to you the silly brother of Battlefield HardLine
So the only amazing thing out of the whole trailer was the 🎶 👌🏼
This Game sucks
this game came out when? and they are now doing a battle pass
Advanced Futuristic Russian Aircraft?   Video game developers have wild imaginations.
NOW THATS A MAP I WANT TO PLAY. Hope it plays like the trailer on last gen
At this point just make 2 eastern front maps for BFV and you’ll literally make many people happy
Sarei bello avere nel multiplayer  anche una nuova modalita  senza carri armati  e aeri
getting some real bf4 vibes with this map. hope it delivers
Can't believe they got this much footage without the game breaking in their face.
Is there a scoreboard yet?
Yawn
Yea, not gonna waste any more time with Scamfield 2042
Im getting hyped ....Fire trailer
This game could have been great, but so many terrible decisions... Next time listen to your community.
REFUND ME THE MONEYYYYYYYYY
That was...underwhelming
We all know that trailer look epic, but  real gameplay not look like this.. remember trailer game
I actually like the looks of this but we still need more maps and guns fast.
After almost a whole year we only get 1 new map and 2 new weapons? One of which no one will really be using is a crossbow? Im not one to really complain all the time but Cmon guys really?
This is probably the least excited I have been after watching a Battlefield Trailer. The new Map looks great. New weapons look great but the problem is I know how the base game plays and feels. It's completely eradicated the kid inside me that got goosebumps with each new trailer. I really hope this moves 2042 in the right direction
At least the learned how to do trailer...
Name song??? 🫡
Unleash the unexpected?
I think the trailer was pretty well composited. Regarding new content, It is what it is. There'd probably be more this season if they didn't have to fix tons of problems in the game
Great job making the trailer look like the good old days (bf3/bf4). Too bad at this point everyone is aware of how bad this title is. You lost everyone  at "NeW SpEcIaLiSt" because it reminded us that this is just a broken and shameless cash grab. RIP battlefield
I'm sure there's not THAT MANY PEOPLE playing so why!!???
This was probably part of the original release, but they said less is more now open your wallets.
Looks  great! Now please add more guns
1 map 😐
L
now free??
Es poco contenido, pero al menos es algo, gracias
Just ONE new map? Lmao
calling renamed as val as a "new" gun is like calling a scoreboard a "new" feature
Wow. Looking forward to play season 1!!!
That's it? One new map, one specialist and a weapon that's been in past Battlefield games?
Insane!
lmao the dislikes, people really WANT to hate this game don't they
Oh boy, the awesome "pass" system we all definitely love. Not at all surprised to see that 💩here.
I think it looks decent but that’s not rlly saying much
Im hyped yeaaaa boyyyyyy
The map dope
Oh what could have been...
Season 1: Zero Content.
Why bother? Just let it die
(sigh)
When you don’t care anymore
oh wow....one map...
Pleasee remove the specialists!!!
Yep....the disappointment just keeps rolling. Well done killing this franchise...
DICEs editing team is top notch that’s for sure
Whoever they have making the game look so hype and playable needs a raise ....
Dead game😴
snorefest
Never again.
Too little too late
I'll probably check it out still want my $130 refund
OP SRAW incoming!
Remember bf4 was once also a huge mess
Lmfao 2 new guns 1 map and 1 operator and everyone is flipping their lid what a joke
👍👍👍
The map actually looks pretty good but we will just have to wait and see. Hopefully they actually have cover on this map!
Wish they weren't this good at making trailers
2 weapons only dice???🤔
Lit trailer ngl
too late battlefield , too late !
if this was real gameplay 70% of those shots would not have registered
I consider myself a non whining battlefield enjoyer 🧐
No dynamic weather changing? or i missed something?
Do I still spawn in 9 miles from a objective? If so I’m ok thanks
В том же духе продолжайте главное.
Guys, be real for a second, have you got no shame?
You cannot deny that the trailer is on fire as always
Nice
Get rid of the specialists, this isn’t Fortnite this is Battlefield.
Crossplay console only please.
EA, you’re a little late to the party.
Oh great... BF2042 is finally out of Beta and has gone Gold.
Ucav 2.0 looks pretty good
the music background sound like from anthem legion of dawn trailer :O
A single solitary map. A specialist (meh), a few guns and some more choppers because the game needs more choppers. I feel so whelmed. Is this lack of anything really supposed to bring back those disappointed with the game?  Having said that, it will probably take 2 weeks to be able to play that map 3 times with the way the game sticks you into the same blimen map time and time again. It isn't worth my time updating the game for a single map, so I guess I'm waiting until season 2 in what ~6 months time to see if there is actually enough content to make things worthwhile?  Or is season 2 just going to be the couple of map modifications on the beta maps of the past 7 months fobbed off as content?  Where is the Portal content?  Remind us again how many studios & Dev's are working on this game again, for this.  First BF game I really regret buying the season pass for, as well as the actual game due to outright fraud by Dice. The way this game is going I'll never buy another BF title again. Not that my few bucks really matter.
Biggest scam ever
🏳‍🌈garbage game🏳‍🌈
where is new portal content?
lmao ill pass
제발 힘내자 아직도 너무 부족하다
I really want this to be good. I have gone back to playing Battlefront 2. I will redownload this game, for the third time now. Hopefully I dont uninstall after a week
bro honestly I’m just gonna wait for the next battlefield cuz this ain’t it
Tank and Helis indoors. LMAO. Can yall fix the lock-in on helis or nah
I dont wanna be excited for this because I was disappointed before but mannnnnnnnn its hard not to be.
OMG !!!!
can't wait NOT to play this...i'm staying at bf4
Say what you want about the game but they do know how to make a trailer!
if they bring classes and rearrange gadgets, game would be hella loved. they can still do specialists and monetize their skins, but an organized class system benefits, especially when its 128 players. map with no cover, we'll still see 30 rockets aimed at ya and choppers mowing down people running across huge maps.
I wanna play this, but I know we were drawn in before and led to disappointment…
It does hint the pass will be free, so we can all have a chance at unlocking all this amazing stuff. The map also looks amazing. Can’t wait to play and hopefully there is little bugs to stop us!
Will this game has new faction etc. Ukraine  China Japan German ?
Wow that's a nice ripoff. I remember the times when Battlefield was a thing.
Hmmm that's actually not bad, i wonder why people hate that game so much
I will not buy Battlefiled 2042 because I am from Russia: P EA you idiots))))
it would be really nice if the game could run properly
Hahahaha hell yeaaaa that jet kill
Half the trailer are soldiers running one of the biggest issues in the game, too much open space 😢
more than 6 months for a map, 3 weapons, 2 vehicles, let that game die
Use this as dislike button
hope the music will make it into the game
These trailers look so hype. Too bad I’ve played the game
make discount !!!!!!!!!!!!!
High expectations don’t mess up
All I wanted is bring back regular soldiers and make specialists same way they did in starwars battlefront.
Made for clowns, by clowns.
MW2 trailer tomorrow 😬
I wish there was a single player game like this
only 1 map really?
This looks awesome
Ngl this actually looks fun, map looks really nice and my expectations are super low for games these days anyway so i can’t be disappointed when i play this. Only thing is this definitely came 6 months too late we should be in season 2 or 3 already but nonetheless i’ll play this :)
Rip my favorite franchise
0:39 UCAV ?!?
Battlefield 2042 Zero Hour Trailer -->  Battlefield 2042 Zero Content Trailer
I thought it was Damavand Peak. Much, much verticality.
One new map and a few new weapons is not enough. DISAPPOINTED!
Ngl that map looks sick
It comes to lately to feel hyped for this
Hey Dice, Ill only play bf2042 when its added to ea play so hurry up and do it please. You want player numbers to increase? thats the only thing that could ever make it happen.
Zero content
This is not Battlefield
Dislike
Not gonna lie........kinda liked what I saw here, better operator or operators B-, new/good weapons C-, new map or maps A-, new and improved vehicles B+  I give it a 65%.
Community:  We hate the specialists.   We want TV Rocket for Helicopters. Dice:  Brings a new specialist with TV Rocket
R. I. P. Battlefield
Wait, this game doesnt even have a season 1 yet?!
Bold of them to release new content when the base game is still a buggy mess...
That new map does look sick tbf
Omg 😍
QUITEN LOS ESPECIALISTAS! Y METAN LAS CLASES.
F to bf
Map looks dope, love the new choppers but I’m also a chopper guy 🤷‍♂️
Master Chief die too!! Lookin' out for Capitan John Price when I find you!
All maps in principal mode please
イケるのか…？！
0:36 *The future is femoid!*
I wish the game was as good as trailers are😭
Fool me once
What a scam of a game this is.
新武器たった2つ？ BF4に追いつくにはあと何年かかるんだ？
It’s actually so sad that this trailer looks and feels like battlefield but when you play it it’s pure garbage, One map & one specialist after 7 months. What a joke!!!!!
This is one of those games where the trailer will look way better than the actual game, just like 2015's Star Wars Battlefront. The trailers are good, but the actual game is not good.
I paid $90....
Please EA let DICE go so they can go back to making good games, thanks
My question is how far after this releases will they pull all development for the game to focus on the next title lol
Refund?
@vga4a
just remaster BC2 and stop making games.
اللعبه الاسوء على الاطلاق ,رجعوا فلوسي وخذوا لعبتكم
and what about portal? We all want classic maps! BF2, BF4, BF1, BFV, Hardline. All BF's in one place! Or will they let him die like Hazardzone?
You killed this game, I don't know if I really want to play it again...  An old Veteran!!
Does anyone still play this game?
Empty
I think the map looks pretty decent now that there are actual bumps in the terrain and other stuff that can be used as cover. The inside areas look cool too, hopefully that means we get actual cqc areas. The map also looks very pretty. Guess we'll see on Thursday  Really sucks how little content there is but hopefully whats there is good. Fingers crossed they'll up the pacing of new content releasing from this point and onward
I feel like a lot of the negative comments are just people fishing for the 1k likes. Nothing wrong with not liking the game, but how long yall going to state the obvious 😂  objectively, trailer looks cool. But it's not a game reviving update and one that comes very late too. I hope to see more frequent content drops and patches. It's REALLY needed with this game rn.
meh
Proof EA (Dice) doesn’t listen, the maps are TOO BIG !!!! No choke points no way of holding enemy back or forcing you to think of ways to flank the enemy etc.
This is pathetic...
You can't deny it, DICE make great trailers.
음…. 신맵도 겁나 황량해보이네…. 맵 밀도 좀 높여주고 엄페물도 적당히 있는 맵이면 좋겠다…. 왜 죄다 엄페물은 생각 안하는 거지…  너무 민짜야 복귀각은 아직 안보이는 군…
as superman said: Not impressed
Battlefield has seen better days🥲🚬
Just cause grappling hook hello!!!!
zzz
This just makes me sad because if the game was exactly like this, 2042 would be the best battlefield game ever
10 Years Late 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Love the support for Portal guys! Really makes me happy seeing you put so much new content into Portal, so happy to hop back in and play all this new content that Portal is going to get!!!!      🙃
I can smell complains already coming from that new rocket launcher
The most sad "DLC" in Battlefield history. Fits pretty well to the game. Good job.
Big RİP to my fellow Airborne Pilots. Good Luck escaping 20+ rockets now with only a flare counter measure
Adds a battle pass before the game is even playable* 🤡
well that was underwhelming... i'm not kidding if i say i watched this trailer between 2 skirmish matches of C&C Generals: Zero hour (one of my all time favourite games). the game is 19 years old and still lets me enjoy it... contrary to battlefield which is enjoyed from bad company 2 till BFV, too bad it ends here
The fact that it seems acceptable to get only one map a season these days is actually embarrassing
Trash 🗑
I wish this game nothing but failure
big good
Use me as the dislike button.
she looks like Ash from Siege
No thanks... Zero Hours played... Zero players
7 months later sheesh
Nothing for Portal.....
This looks sick.
BFV became great when the Pacific Content was added late in the games life cycle. I still have hope they can turn things around.
1 specialist, 1 map, 2 guns, 2 helicopter omg.....
Cool, cant wait to be disappointed for a second time.
Go go go
MAN I SHOULDA GOT THIS GAME, IT LOOKS SO FUN!!!
Dice can make really good trailers just not good games
I mean it looks cool but I'm not really excited, I am however a bit hopeful that they can get this mess working well.
Zero Player
1 new map, 1 new operator, 2 weapons, 1 helikopter, this is joke 😂... This map looks like from star wars.
Most of the time battlefield knows how to make trailer. but its like judging a book from its cover
I wonder how many dislike on this video
2042 is living rent free
You guys do indeed know how to make a good trailer!
Awesome 👍👌
😣
Questo battelfied  non lo so che gioco e quello che vedo che è solo un casino sulle mappe passi che non si sentono
I've already lost interest in playing this game after how bad it was after launch. There was no effort to even acknowledge what was wrong with the game.  I am not supporting anything in this franchise anymore. No more faith
is it free yet??  i will just hold on to my money for a while longer and hopefully it will be on EA access free
Why i bought this game
Looks like an alpha of BF3
Love the trailers but gameplay is trash
The grafics sucks 🤡
Well... Let's hope MWII have Ground War 😅
More like Season 1: Zero Hour Playtime
Tbh I been playing bf4 I don’t want to play 2042
What a good trailer, but what a bad game.  You Hurt me Battlefield.
شكلة لا بأس
Bruh
Rip Battlefield 😢😢
Lame as f
Don’t do this to me again, I fell for the official first gameplay and the launch trailer I played the game 3x at most and that was the week of launch after that I’ve been hoping for a refund !
better skins pls but it's a good step in the right direction
horrible
Oh! Will Ewelina Lis a battle hardened veteran with PTSD crack some jokes at the ending screen? You know, something like "I didn't even break a sweat" or "If only I had that $10,99 cameo skin. I would rock even more!"
1:36 I'm not sure if I like that this even work
If the game ran smooth i'd play it well but OMG THE STUTTER IS HORRIBLE
Zzzzzzzzzzz
Funny how even in the trailer the game drops alot fps
Im sure thats how it actually plays
Bots
Take me back to the days of good old DLC where for 15€ we had real content! RATIO
For the love of god, fix the Aim Assist!!!! Consoles stand no chance against PC
After years of absence, the crossbow returns.
Hold up, Dice shows a trailer with a bunch of Air Attack vehicles being used at the same time on the same day they're reducing the amount that can be used at any one given time. Seems like false advertising to me.
oh...god, when the old BF had a new content/maps come out, I felt excited,  but this time I don't have any feelings :(
I think my grandfather is working on this game, everything is old and boring
cool trailer but the game still trash
Ok that look pretty dam good
Шляпа , только трейлеры и умеете делать .
is that china army or i m worng
The new map gives me Damavand vibes! And the SRAW reminded me of Matimi0! lol I do have a lil hope for this game still! 💙
Wait and see....
Look I don't like BF2042. But I have recently started playing it alot more, after a long absence from it, and i kinda like it, so hopefully this won't be as bad as the first few weeks of 2042.
uff 1 more day to MW 2 world premiere
Soon it will be one year since they revealed this game, and this game still seems to be an early alpha.
What happened to six weapons with each season? Another scam by dice/ea.
GIVE MY MONEY BACK PLZ
Where is the A 545 assault rifle battlefield?
Wow a guided missile that’s limited too only one specialist I remember a time when you select what ever rocket launcher you wanted on a class that was designed for anti-vehicles.
ah yes lets add another woman smh.. bring back the classes
I have no hope to be honest...
Dislike
This gonna bring the game back to what it needed to be.
looks fun to me,
Only one new map! And only one new specialist which everyone hates already. Just go back to the classes. And how much is this gonna get set people back?
seria melhor ter ido ver o filme do pelé.
Can't dupe us twice. Sorry, the game was traded in on day 3 for me. Id rather watch the trailers..
Ok this gets me hyped, I can’t wait for season 1
Hit like if you want EA to make Battlefield free to play. ♥
Anyone up for bets on how botched this will be?
Amazing trailer...
*И ВСЁ ЭТО НА 20 ФПС (ЗАБЫЛИ ДОБАВИТЬ)  то как элекроники обосрались они вообще этот battleass должны бесплатно отдавать*
It's not free, NO MESSIRVE
Trust you for the last time...
95 percent LGBTQ communist progression, 5 percent for the actual normal players gg they definitely know what they are doing ;)
Is this free or part of the season pass (£36?) should be free ideally after the games state (!)
Is it bad that I want 2042 now, only played it once with the free trial and didn’t like it then, but now I kind of want it because of content finally dropped
lmao you can see the framedrops.....
The game is even lagging in the trailer
Even the clips in the trailer are at a low framerate 😂
I don't even feel excited while watching this. The fact that it doesn't release today either means I can't even try it out to rectify my doubts too.
I will never ever pay even a buck on this game… Think of those who bought gold/ultimate edition…more than 6 month later the get 1 new map/specialist/weapon/vehicle. Better to let this game go!
Please make this game good
This better be the best map in the game
Meanwhile, No Mans Sky devs keep releasing all post launch content for free.......
Like really? Two weapons? 2 friggin weapons Dice? You ok?
I actually played 60 hours and had some fun. Still would not recommend, still call it a dead game. There is just so much talented folk at DICE, but the direction is just off. There should be at least 200.000 people playing DICE latest game right now, not 10K incl console. There is no fun, there is no trust, so I really dont think this can bring anyone back. And im a biased swedish person that remembered waiting for battlefield vietnam to come out.
Battlefield isnt what it was dice should hang their heads in shame
Players: we don’t want specialists  Dice: Here have another one lol
So in total we have: 1 specialist 2 guns 1 map 2 vehicles  In comparison, BF4 by this time had received: 12 new maps 15 new weapons 4 new gadgets 5 new vehicles 3 new game modes  All of this, and the next dlc, Dragon's Teeth, was just over 1 month away Pathetic
Does anyone know the name of the music ? I’m pretty sure that it’s 2wei but I don’t know which of their music it is.
1 map?  After 7 months?   You must have spent the majority of this time taking down all the rainbow flags in the office that it took you the two previous years to put up.  What a sad joke this franchise has become.
they can only go up. unless they go down
Battlefield 2042: zero content
ya no es la misma emocion que solia ser :(
really took them 9 months to make a mediocre map. This is what happens when the developers are too up them selves
The game fixed yet?
I had no expectations and you’ve still disappointed me
Trailer huii ingame Pfuii
Wing suits and load outs still locked behind token specialists. Foxtrot Yankee, over.
Everything the community said they didn't want is what you have included 🤣😆 For the love of... listen just put yourselves and the rest of us out of our misery and just give up on 2042, we beg you!!
I kinda wish they would do story expansions with each season idk this isn't what i ever thought battlefield would be
Trash. Still no infantry map
Dislike
Your trailers are always so cool, then you see the gameplay and it looks like any shooter played on play station 2. I think all those videos are just smoke in our eyes. Why should we be hyped if we know even before watch it that the real game wont be look like that ? 🙃
I haven’t bought the game but going to looks good the trailer.
Nope. You guys had your chance (or 100). You are lying, you are greedy, you don’t listen to you fans. No, just no thank you.
I don't know if I should be excited about this, the trailer looks good but this game has done so poorly, this stuff should have been in the game by January if the game was actually good, my expectations are so low that I feel this trailer will look 10x better than when this will actually come out, and once again people will be disappointed.
A empresa ganhadora de produção de trailers. O jogo, infelizmente flopou.
where story cinematic ?
That gameplay premiere was extremely underwhelming. I'm still going to try it out when it releases, but after seeing this my hopes aren't high at all. A crossbow? this is 2042, not 1342.
That reminds me of Battlefield V's first chapter that has the same results.
The pg run still looks like something out of a chinese free to play game.  It's an incredible step back from Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1.
ZERO... CONTENT
I wanted to play Battlefield; not get played by it.    This looks good; I hope it is.  But one map after 8 months?  Come on..
Don't be fooled by flashy trailers. Remember, the launch trailer for the game is very different than what the game was. So if you haven't purchased the game, WAIT.
im trailer schaut das halt alles so geil aus ob es sich dann auch so geil spielen lässt ist die andere frage lassen wir uns überraschen ^^
Trailer always hyping but in reality, game is still bad
To the development teams, Don't give up and don't give in. Make the most out of the remaining 3 seasons before you're forced to move on, it's the best move you can make. Even though that content is probably already made if not already through the ideas phase.
It's Morbin Time!!
Wasn’t this map part of the original trailers?
These indie titles need all the support they can get guys.
You managed to destroy a franchise in a single game. Congratulations!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩
Ill wait a few more months to see more reviews and updates before considering reinstalling again
Hope they fix the input delay on last gen consoles
Looks cool
ASSUMING THE CONTENT IS GOOD NO ONE CAN EVEN RUN THE GAME SO WHO CARES
I'll give it a try, too many people are just needlessly toxic
You've played : 0 hour
Ok, now make it F2P
DoN’T bE sAd, tHiS iS jUsT hOw iT wOrKs oUt SoMeTiMeS
Anyone else stop watching as soon as they showed the new specialist?
7 month for this? ONE Map?  New weapons new vehicles? Dont even dare to say how.... "many"
But when will tornadoes suck you up without having to literally sprint into the middle of them?
This is just sad, a franchise that many loved for decades is being hold hostage by corporation greed.
dead game lol
i think i am having a bonor...and its a hard one
I really hate this game because of the specialists designs, instead of shooting an enemy soldier in the dark now we are shooting an individual with some LED lights Slapped on to them
finally
Finally, the first really huge update
We are waiting for Server Browser.  ✅ Server Browser ❌ Matchmaking  ✅ Classes ❌ Specialists
when start season 2?
Trash
Why they don't put those trailer soundtrack in game and in the menu instead of sounds of metal parts scraping each other.
So much content let’s goooooooooo thanks dice for this. I love y’all !!!
Cool trailer, game probably still isn’t good enough
Nope
Can only go up after they've hit rock bottom. We'll see what happens.
WHAT ABIUT PORTSL NEW MAPS?
Zero content
Херня с под коня
Not worth a reinstall.
What’s the point if they are just taking Vehicles away to appease who ever they are making the game for
nice
Sure.
Not complaining or anything because this stuff looks cool you know, but it took 8 months for them to release the map shown in the first couple of seconds in the trailer
For what i see thers a lot more cover than the rest of BF 2042 maps.
모르겠고 환불해줘
Just scrap the game already what a joke
it used to be 4 maps back in the day now it's just 1 map and it took more than twice the time to get it out ...
Is this a joke?
Trash game, remove the operators and bring back classes then we can talk.
too little, too late
I'm not a big fan with the 64 breakthrough, that's the whole reason why I decided to switch the series x to play the 128 matches
I haven’t been able to play in almost six months there’s literally no one else to play with on series x it’s just empty lobbies
we need a trailer for bugs contents
Remember when bf4 and bf1 were getting timely updates, 4 maps with every season.
8 months for this?? Season 1 should be called Zero Content..
Impresionante esta temporada 1 espero que sigan así guapísima las nuevas armas
Love the attempt to hype up 1 new map and 2 new vehicles after months of absolutely nothing.
I mean... you can make a trailer look good. Even the original bf2042 looked rly cool... how that went off we all know. I dont trust that all out of sudden you put behind you all the corporate greed and suddenly you grasp the true Battlefield vision back. That all out of sudden the inexperienced and crunched devs will deliver fundamentaly functioning content. I dont belive EA nor DICE.  And i DARE you to prove me wrong. Show me how wrong i am and how you actually changed!
What an insult.
After 7 whole months. 1 map, 2 helicopters, 2 weapons, Fortnite characters are still a thing, no levelution or destruction for that matter. Yeah I think it’s safe to say battlefield is officially dead. Rip Battlefield
Meh
Graphics look worse than bf3
I didn't buy the game. Is the game fixed/fixable?  Doesn't sound like it, when reading the comments below.
I hope we’ve all learned our lesson and not get hyped for this. It’s okay to be interested but overexaggerating is extra
Can we get this on Game Pass already? Or get Battlefield V back?
Can we stop making specialists and go back to the classic class system. It's what everyone wants. Please.
bruh . . . . . . . . . . . bruh
I just wanna say it looks good as hell. But i know this is all fake. 1037 bugs. Spam E to get out and still cant. 20-42 fps.
People seem to forget that this "update" wont change anything from the base game design so it still a bad BF no matter what.
Barely able to get a game started as the player base has all but given up on this. As usual, trailers look great and then you play it and well, we know the rest 🤦🏻‍♂️
流石に追加要素弱くない？
Ну что попробуйте поднять онлайн с 3000 ...
RIP BATTLEFIELD
Another Specialist to make "you" feel special. Just you and not working as a cog part of the team machine. So excited 😂
okay, you have my attention!
looks amazing, but to late.
New specialist is for engineers with rocket launcher/MPADS and repair tool?
KB / Mouse on Console yet?
Dice good at making trailers bad at making games
the game is anything but dead, i hope you developers believe in the project a little more with new modes and new maps the game is very nice don't let it die
I was waiting for the server browser, because this game is already dead and it's hard to find a game
Is the game even fixed???
Kids Game. Guys dont buy this Game
do people still even play this game?
😂 garbage as expected
I forgot this game existed.
Looks like a sick map!😎🤟🏽
they can make cool trailers but remember the release trailer and the game we have now
Is time to wait for another 9 months for the new map
thank you for empty open world !
I want a refund for this scam
yeah ima go head & wait a week on this one. that last waste of money was the worst. sorry BF. you were my fave.
Shame ......just shame
Was hoping to see more map remakes of older BF titles as per rumours but looks like it didn't showed up on the trailer.  Such as a disappointing content release as I was expecting infantry focus maps like Operation Metro or Locker.
How did we go from  Exodus Short Film to this? Im hyped, but im still a bit confused
Gooooddddddddddddd ❤️❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️❤️🤭
2 WEAPONS?!! AFTER ALL THIS TIME JUST 2 WEAPONS AND ONE OF THEM IS A CROSSBOW?!! There is such a shocking lack of content in this and they have the gall to charge for a battle pass, if this doesn’t kill off the remaining players i don’t know what will
6.6k down votes for those who cant see
Get super hyped to battle AI
The trailer is good, and feels like battlefield, but I wonder if that will translate to the game
No thanks, ima keep playing Bf4
hey DICE can you please start to work ?
Actually a good battlefield trailer.      Still refund.
After 9 months you gave what fans you have left (which isn’t many) one map and two guns.. wow you guys suuuure delivered!
シーズン1まで長すぎやろｗ 買わなくてよかった～
looks like battlefield 2
Thats it? We waited 9 months for just one new map?!
1 map, 1 specialist, 2 gun and 2 helicopter (well one for each team so one with two different skin)  So much content after 8 month, thanks dice !
for mobile users, there is currently 7.7k likes and 6k dislikes
Yessss
New No man's sky.
Reminds me of the original gameplay trailer. Gameplay is no where near as polished as this.
Everyone's hating but the game is in a SIGNIFICANTLY better place after the last couple of updates. The game is actually fun again now. Half of the 2042 maps still suck however.
Fix the game 1st
Does the game even works already?
Can't wait for MW2
Pls wrk 😮‍💨
Looks like this man is gonna re download battlefield 2042
This looks good, I will give them that, but the game launched in October. I would have expected something like this come January, not June (8 months after launch).   I know there have been numerous updates, but those were getting the game to a position in which it should have launched from. Makes me wonder what are dice actually doing considering it's taking them so long to get anything done. This is not how you keep a game alive
people that say "the damage has been done" clearly forgot the clusterfuck that was no man sky. and that game has been pulling steady figures since they improved it..
A New locker map?
Man if only this game were feature complete
Id be suprised if this content drop somehow saves the game
Fool me once...
Dislike button where?
At this point the should just make a movie , think they would make more money because they sure know how to make trailers pump u up
We knew this game was gonna be Battlepunk 2042 the moment they delayed it.
Bro this game is so dead that I’m not even a bit hyped for this
The map appears to be good, but we shall see. The crossbow is nice as well as the guided rocket. But we shall see how it plays out. I hope this update does something for the game. But I do hope the next seasons have way more content than this.
I no longer trust your trailers. I will wait two weeks and then see what the player opinions are.
Wow 2 new weapons  after 8 months, Dice doesn't want his players back.. Rip bf
Please SAVE Battlefield 2042. More updates! Update destruction. Show the real war following the example of the war between Russia and Ukraine (NATO)
we don't trust you anymore EA.
Yo DICE, as a day 1 buyer I feel cheated everyday but I admit this looks GOOOOD
why only one maps?
Looking forward to playing this for 10 minutes then deleting it
No one wants specialists, doesn't suit battlefield at all. Bring back classes.
So much hate towards specialists...they're a great addition. Varying gameplay keeps me interested.
Is it really just 1 map?
please make a server rotation for this map only,
Another op specialist? Not reinstalling
Specialists = me not coming back. No specialists = me coming back
I don't think it's enough
Wow amazing Trailer as Always. But still Specialists, still the worst Battlefield I've ever played...
When the gameplay trailer has more screen time for text and quick cut aways, you know its trash
Sick, I’m not gonna play this 😀
Heh
Battlefield 2042 Season One: Zero Refund
This is lacking so much content its just embarrassing for Dice at this point
Very nice! Keep it up and hope for many new and returning players after this update!  I've already played after the todays update and can tell there is a major performance and gameplay improvement! Good job on that.
But these kinds of soundtracks should be IN THE GAME
Debieron ser al menos 2 mapas 💔
lmao they really added the cobra r9
Congrats DICE on being the biggest laughingstock in the industry.  We.  Do.  Not.  Want.  A.  Hero.  Shooter.  BOYCOTT ALL EA LIVE SERVICES!
Why was not this added after release?
Where are my regular classes, Summer?
Lmao the stutter
This is it? This game dropped in November
The guided rocket is going to be annoying
Now THIS is in my opinion is battlefield
nEw WeApoNS(TWO WEAPONS) We gave you 6 months, but no weapons? Really?
Before 2042 I would have been stoked for this trailer. I'd have been sat in a Discord with some mates and we would have watched together and loved every minute.  Now I'm just meh.  I paid for the top version of the game and what for?  One map when the first DLC gets here?  4 Maps from new, hardly any weapons and operators that look like they were hired from the local special school.  I still play BF2042,  but I feel betrayed and let down.
maby if you whent free to play i whut play it
The only thing DICE can make is a good trailer. That said, this is way too late for the game. if this was released in December or January, then people would at least come back to try it. But I have no interest in even reinstalling the game at this point.
You fooled me once with those pretty trailers. No more. First season after 8 months lol
Perro juegazo, 🎮🔥no sé porque a muchos no les gusta, lástima que no lo pueda jugar 😕
specialist just don't belong
Trailer seems cool, but I want refund...
Still not buying this game…
Please bring back the classes system, not only in Portal.
Its battlefailed 2042 not battlefield 2042
no matter how much you recycle trash. it trash ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ시발ㅋㅋ
At least the BF team has the decency to allow comments on the video unlike many other YouTube companies.
This game still dead 😆
7.8k Likes / 6.1K Dislikes right now
Bet the game crash.  Then we get more excuses.  I would like to make my own specialist not force me to play all dummies except one
Zero hours until the game is dead?
I thought it was gonna be a damavand peak remake for a sec lol
Y’all release phenomenal trailers then release a game full things nobody asked for and then  release 1 map after what 7 months of nothing? 😐 and people are defending y’all… how pathetic
Polska gurom!!!
I wanted this battlefield 2042 to have battle royale mode and solo mode, and that the game would be fun too, but this first season must be pretty cool.
let's go!
Meh.
I hope that crossbow gets a skin referencing the Phantom Bow, even though that program seems long gone now. It is, if my memory serves me right, the first bow since BF4. Since it does seem to have different ammunition types, it would be a nice callback.
only me who noticed the beginning is like from BF3's multiplayer gameplay trailer?
Extremely underwhelming.
Zero hours put into the game
soo 1 of the 2 new guns is the AS-VAL which was already available in portal? yikes
Imma keep an eye on it but still VERY late
I’m cautiously hopeful…
A new map. A battlepass. A new specialist. All these things but no fixes on actual gameplay, no end game scoreboard, nothing taking us back to the classic battlefield we all know and love. Thanks! Can’t wait! 😐
After almost a year after launch we finally get season 1... wow.
Yo it's pretty cool.
Just kill the game this is embarrassing
They make best trailers... i wish the game is at 20% of that
Lmao ı was shocked is this game still alive
lmao when he grappled the jet I thought he was gonna hijack it
Not much seems to be added to the game. 2 weapons, a character we dont care about with a guided rocket, a stealth chopper. And whatever the hell the season pass will be.
DICE depends on how well they can make BF2042 better over the next year. Up until now, they have probably been devoting their resources to fixing bugs, but I hope they will work hard to make it a god game from now on. Good luck.               From Japan.
zero hours of play
can I get my money back so i can buy CODWM2 pls  I spent all my money on this
So see you in 8 months or longer
Refund
Please be decent at least
The map does look really nice
wasn't feeling excited till that last part but lets be real somethings gonna flop.... it's 2042....
New Map Good 👍👍
Probably make the game Free to play🤷🏽‍♂️
دايماً دايس تبدع بعد سنه من نزول اللعبه
If only they had kept 64 players and classes...
All trailers for this game are great. if only the game was good as well.  Also portable TV rockets? 14 year old me couldn't even have dreamed of that while playing Battlefield 3
At this point battlefield 4 had released additional 12 maps in its cycle
This game has been out 7 months and this is the first update that’s just sad, this game died before it had a chance
New weapon?  Lol yall just ported over the VKS from BF3.
Honestly, tried today's 1.0 patch and game feels so much smoother as an experience. This is how it should've launched. Imagine if past 8 month team spent on new content and not making this game playable.
We already paid for it and got stuck with it. Guess I'll give it a try till I can't stand playing it anymore, again.
Lost potential. With every trailer i get hyped, then i play and get disappointed, i wish eventually this game will be fixed and be fun to play
Weak. Come on DICE, pull the plug and give the hardcore vets something to be excited about. This aint it, cheif.
Une magnifique carotte
Why isn’t a controllable missile just a piece of equipment for the assault class?
I'm only here for updates on Portal and to laugh at you and since there are no Portal updates
ah yes, Just Cause 3
one map!.. one map... DICE, you didn't overdo it, maybe you shouldn't have?
I hope it clutches like War in The Pacific did in Battlefield V.
Man just give me my money back
Nah, you had yall's last chance with me, never buying a AAA game again
От трейлери вони робити вміють)
Anyone still playing this in Asia? Last time I played BF2042, there are only like 8-10 real players on the servers and the rest are just mindless AI bots.
I remember the last time i got hyped😂🤘🏽
Why does the game look so bad, seriously all other current battlefields have gorgeous graphics but this looks like a mobile game
Battlefield can always do trailers gotta give em that
Best thing about battlefield 2042 is its trailers :p
Please focus on improving your game optimization rather than this. So people with 6th or 7th gen pcs can also play
Eh, thanks but I'll stick w bf1
Bruh if u don't bring back destruction i don't care
Should be renamed to Zero content
Keep the content coming. I'm excited for the new season!
Perdon mi ingles no es bueno, dijeron 1 mapa nuevo? Unooooo????
Look's good
Back to Karka.. oh wait, no.
Use me as a DISLIKE button.
So many studios working on BF2042 and only 1 map🤷🏼‍♂️. I was hoping for some more BF3 maps in portal. Slightly disappointed to be honest.
looking cool, can't wait to try all the stuff. Thank You DICE
É sério mesmo ea que acha que a meia dúzia de gato pingado que sobrou ainda vai pagar por passe de temporada??? pra jogar com quem?? o Gasparzinho?? empresa ridícula
I'm pretty sure we will gain players again...
BP for free i hope ?(of course not).  And btw its 1 map \2 guns\1 heli .... and thats all . lol.
Battlefield 4 are you?
Remort missile is so good. But...  Where is the "Operation Locker"?
get rid of the specialists already
Why have you given infantry a TV missile and not a SRAW?  And why did you reduce the number of aircraft in the match in the same patch?  While ALSO adding a new helicopter to the game...  You do realise that you’ve managed to kill off aircraft entierly now. And without having made any actual balance changes to make them fun and fair.
I wonder how many suckers are still playing this game.
Updates to this game are welcome. Doesn't mean EA and Dice are forgiven for the state this game was released
Zero content
Weapons for PC players, great.
Verry bad game
Ewelina Lis widzę że ma na wyposażeniu coś podobnego do Pioruna :)
I'll give it a try! Looks good
ok, this does look pretty good, i just hope they put in as much effort into the update as they did with the trailer  though i cant help but worry if the new specialist's guided rocket launcher will cause even more headaches for players
как много контента! аж глаза разбегаются! позорище
Lol game has been out for what 8 months and they have a not all images are in game. Everything you show should be actual gameplay now.
Ngl its actually not bad. But really 1 new weapon. Its not even considered to be a new weapon since the VSSM Vintorez is just a sniper variant of the AS Val that's already in BF3 Portal. The only difference is that it has a different stock, that's it. Can we at least get more weapons throughout the season, if not at least put BF3 and Bad Company 2 Portal Weapons in the main game
Still playing BF4......I'm just saying.
I saw Zero Hour and was excited for a moment  but then I saw BF2042
By the trailer its always seems funny af, but the true gameplay its never funny as the trailer
whaddup with the dislikes boys?
Когда игру бесплатно раздавать уже начнут?
Now they want to give us what we all been begging for years ago 😆😆
This looks like Battlefield, let's hope it will be one
Watching this trailer after seeing how broken the game is..   *Doubt*
This game is still alive? Wow.
Bro who uses a lock-on rocket launcher to lock on a helicopter right in front of you
Looks just as good as the launch trailer... heh 🤔
Caspian Border vibes
Once again the trailer is good, but i hope its actually true and no lies.
LET'S GOOOO!!!!!
7 months....1 map....2 weapons and 1 specialist that nobody wants or cares about.  Just waive the white flag already and admit you're only doing the bare minimum to avoid getting sued by those of us who were dumb enough to pre-purchase these "4 seasons" of content.
Cute that you're trying to compete with the upcoming modern warfare 2 reveal
Fake trailer. Again
That’s an improvement but it’s not hard to improve on garbage: captain price
Notice how no one receives a suppression effect when being shot at? Looks like they still haven’t implemented a key legacy feature.   But the trailer does look cool. They definitely have a good team working on that stuff. Unlike some other things
So somehow after eight months all you have to offer is a single new map a single new specialist and a few new guns and a battle pass to get what we already know is 99% garbage battle pass?! After eight months this is all you can show? Bf4 after eight months had over two expansions come out with four maps each. Sorry I was trying to be optimistic but this is honestly pathetic
“Keep your expectations low and you’ll never be disappointed” Kratos, GOW 2018
Cómo matar a la franquicia .... Solo añade dos armas ..un mapa , y dos nuevas armas.  Así los pocos que jugamos esto nos retiramos para que lo sepulten. Banda ..  ya no compren bf no preordenen.
nope u didnt convine me insted delete specialist they add one more
Is this footage from hardcore? How are they actually killing people?
Only one map ? WHere are the 3 others maps  we paid ?
Waited half a year for that is laughably bad. Triple A studio taking that long and not to mention half of it is adding content from portal to the main game. Lazy at best imo
Lovely stuff!
This looks spicy
It's as if they fired all the devs and kept the marketing team.
F
один хер выглядит всё картонно как то
It’s sad to say that you truly can’t really be excited about this because it’s just more money this game is trying to shovel out.  Releasing a broken and unfinished game full price to the masses, doing bare minimum to fix it, and now are releasing a Battle Pass and skins and such to purchase.  On top of that, 2 guns, a map, and an operator. After 8 months of no new content. To me, this really does seem like just a way for them to churn out just a biiit more money before it all dies.  People will be too oblivious to the fun colors and explosions and dynamic looking trailer, to fully remember what game came out back in October.  To me, it doesn’t matter what you do or add. Even if they said 40 weapons, 5 operators, and 10 maps were coming (obviously unrealistic), it still wouldn’t take the bad taste out of my mouth from everything that transpired upon release.  TL;DR - Don’t purchase and accept live service games if the company won’t deliver on the product day 1
Please be good
Наконец-то!  Хоть что-то выпустили! Выглядит очень круто! Сделайте выбор серверов для определенных карт!
REMEMBER: 1 Specialist 2 Weapons 1 Map + Anime Bundle in Store
💩
Does anyone care?  Just give up and move on.   I uninstalled a long time ago and I’m not going to try again.
Refund PLIS
What about Portal maps????
tell you what though they can make some good trailers LOL
Performance fix?
Just only 1 map...
Omg there is so much cover
to less, to late.
This Game is💩💩💩💩💩💩
Why the music in the trailers is always way better than the music in the game?
If you don't like this trailer you are a hater, looks good dice.
This trailer brings me literally 0 emotions unlike any other trailer. Compare this to BF1 and you will understand it
this all looks pretty good, except for those helicopters, we dont need more helicopters
Finally the games out!
A hand held tv missile it is
this is assault mode?
i want to play this game again so bad but its just so unfinished, i put 50hrs in and quit the game was too buggy at the time but this trailer makes me wanna try again
1 new specialist 2 new maps for All-Out Warfare and Hazard Zone 2 new maps for Battlefield Portal An update for the Hazard Zone 6 to 8 new weapons for each mode 2 to 3 new vehicles for each mode   From all of this we only get 2 Weapons, 2 Vehicles and only 1 Map..... NICE xD
I just wanna bf portal. And operation metro in it  no 2042 content
EA had a very good trailer development team other than any gaming industry. The theme was also good.
this looking forward
Not even ONE remastered old map. Only ONE new map. This franchise is done I'm afraid, everything they do is wrong.
Doesn’t seem bad tbh. But then again the trailer didn’t seem bad either. Will be sure to give it a go though.
1 map and 1 new specialist, 2 new weapons and maybe 2 new vehicles? you guys arent even trying. You guys are a disgrace to the gaming community releasing this after 8 months of severe backlash and gamebreaking bugs and missing content.
Trailer is good. Reminds of BF3/BF4 trailers from back in the day, with gameplay being the main subject.  We will see if update will have any reasonable impact on the game. Sadly, I stopped believing ages ago.
This trailer brings me hope
A crossbow as a new weapon? Realy? What a joke of a Battlefield game this is
We are 7 months in we finally get a trailer for content on a still broken game. EA just give people the option of a refund, maybe if u fix it people will buy the game but I feel so scammed at this point and so do 200,000+ people. Take responsibility and suck it up
Zero Content*
Yeah this game deserves to flop and give everyone refunds. This little content after months is pathetic. Play Splitgate, WW3, Insurgency, or a variety of other games instead of this garbage.
I hope the map is good. It’s still possible to make the game great.
Absolute trash
Wow this looks good
I just want bf4 classes. Not all these weird specialists. All we need is medic, support, assault and recon.
Not bad for one intern
So it's just one new map and one new specialist and probably make us pay for the battle pass, was hoping for more
Dice pls. 1 Map, 1 Specialist and only 2 new Weapons in 6 months of silence? If this remains the following 3 seasons your franchise is dead. Why not stick to 64 player action? why no more content in over 6 months since the game released? even if you put all the maps and weapons from portal to the main game would be great, with adding a few weapons and like 2-3 new maps per season is all your fans want. stuff like this is pathetic for a multimilliondollar company tbh... sad to see the franchise breaks apart, i really hope you guys get it around in the next months
NEW weapons = ONLY 2
Whatever you do fails
Looks amazing in a trailer...how's the game play there EA? You only have up to go when you set the bar at rock bottom!!!
If they threw in a remastered Metro they would have upped the Hype at least 50%!
Suprised EA is keeping DICE around, they've shut down companies for less.
Great. Down to one attack air vehicle per team and now there's another anti aircraft weapon/specialist
i expected nothing      and they give us nothing I think i cant complain
The gameplay portion's editing feels just as blood pumping as those BF3 DLC trailers of old, but then I was reminded which game it is advertising... The battle pass portion doesn't help either. The lack of identity in this game just can't be saved without being a completely different game.
How long did it take you to get all of the 2 thousand or so players left together to record this??
Battlefront 2 had a terrible launch but, after many patches and expansions, the game was great and fun. Then Battlefield 2042 was revealed and had a terrible launch. History repeats itself
DICE could've just let the player create their own "nopat" and called it a day but no they had to add Another female operator..... These people have never been to a BCT or a even done research on real operators they just say "we need diversity" and put X group that doesn't make sense. Also no helmet, I don't know how these mercs could have 5k worth of weapons and gear but not wear armor or helmets
Battlefailed 2,042 players
bruh
Maybe is time to redemption
You just know when this drops it’s gonna have all types of glitches and bad map design and balance and server errors
first expansion of bf4 was 4 maps 5 weapons and 3 equipments
Still some game like on beginning, whit only one new specialist who will desroyed the field more than before i mean that in bad meaning. Don't get me wrong. Dice make progress with patches but I don't think this is the good way. I assume better map can be some town you know some urban warfare
If they removed specialists and returned to the class based system, a good amount of the backlash which the game faces wouldn't be valid. They could atleast make classes at the center of it all and have the specialists baked into some sort of reinforcement based system like 'get a killstreak of 5 within the match, receive option to have 1-3 lives as a specialist of choice'. I don't know, content in this trailer looks fairly solid if they can expand on it, but specialists are spoiling it all.
Is it ok to worry when even the trailer doesn't run fluid?
I hope they made it better and I hope the guns are much better. Battlefield 4 had the best guns.
"Not all Images appear In-Game"
Battlefield 2042 : No Content
It's a shame gameplay isn't like this. If it was, I would be playing this game 24/7
Zero Destruction
Season 1 - Zero Content
Crossbow 😮‍💨
You should've added rap music, then it would've been a great Fortnite/Apex Legends new season trailer! 👌
I mean credit where credit's due, the trailers for this game are the only aspect that has genuine quality behind it.
XD so much open space
Even CDPR apologized and made a video about every fix they did and new content they planned.  2 minutes of nothing EA.  How to ruin a legacy 101.  Is that an out of season April fools joke?
Wow a crossbow 😐😐😐😐😐
It’s morbin time
This game is just dead.  Waiting for mw2.
Cool, is there a second part for the trailer with more maps and weapons or are we expected to get 1 map every 9 months?
There’s barely any content but I can’t lie, the grapple hook onto the jet was pretty epic
What a dissapointment, battlefailed 2042
Одна карта , два вида оружия , два вида транспорта и один оперативник , это весь контент который все ждали пол года ?
F
Vignette in the end screen says it all 😑
Трейлер красивый, но контента мало. Карта вроде выглядит интересно, но будем смотреть. Надеюсь 2 сезон будет более полон контентом.
Everyone seems to be excited for the new content. I'm worried, cuz if you've been playing you know, everytime they touch the game, something bugs out.
i hope they improve PC performance with the update. Last time i checked after a update i had huge stuttering and lower fps then before...
It took them 7 months to release the first "major" update and all they managed to give us is 1 new map, 2 new guns and 2 new helicopters.
Puedo entender que estén en crisis interna pero madre mía solo un mapa la cosa no está muy bien que digamos
love it
Oh my god I’m so disappointed, the game still cartoon did I just noticed a character wearing a sunglasses in the battle!! We expected less cring and taking us out of battlefield feeling!!! Is this trailer actually about the crossbow ? You want us to say wow we can damage the jet!!! is this what you’ve been working on??!!!!!!!
ok
And what about optimization Dice ?
Honestly looks like a decent map
I hope all errors have been corrected and the ia have been abolished
We are waiting more than 6 Months for the first season and then there is only one new Map... I want my money back for the ultimate edition. Use me as an Dislike-Button
Levolution?
Finally, i see BF4 level trailer, maybie the gameplay will be at least that good also. Or so i really hope.
man i still cant even get passed the homescreen this game still clitchy
Did I just witness more open area on the new map lmao
And I thought 343 was being lazy with Halo Infinite, this game is only getting new content now and it's one map, DICE is a walking corpse
8 months for this content...
0 interest
This game CAN turn around like Ghost Recon Breakpoint did after two years of updates and is now a GREAT game! 👀 This is just Season One y'all! 👀😏
Im not gonna lie this doesnt look too bad i just hope they add more weapons
Never forget guys, we didn’t get the Eastern Front in BFV for this game.
Can't wait to play on the new map ! :)
Dice really knows how to make a trailer
Where is the cover?
​MORBIUS✅BF2042✖
Tbf, it looks really cool! Is it enough? ... idk yet. But i hope for the best and a few give it a try again!
Season 1 ZERO CONTENT One map for half year, one more empty field with mountains
Season 1 is probably so small because they had to fix most of the games release bugs and some (map fixes, weapon and vehicle balancing, ect). That being said, Season 2 and onward will probably be smashing hits. We'll have to see. I already enjoy the base game so seeing stuff like this is awesome.
Keeping my hopes up for the major comeback in a battlefield 💪🏻
This one will be DICE at the top of their game.
More choppers, exactly what the game needed!
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
MORBIUS✅BF2042✖️
Optimization please
Make it free to play
Thats a sick trailer ngl, so when is this game coming out?
Lisowska czemu nie gadasz po polsku?
Is this free to play yet?
Otra vez mapa sin coberturas.
Physically dropped my phone in disappointment when they showed the new launcher was specialist specific and not just a new gadget, a harsh reminder of what battlefield has become
another wide open map...
What?? Nothing for portal??? That's pretty much all I play in this game, is that dead now too???
What the hell have they been doing for the past 6 months if this is all we’re getting
Y’all hurt me 🤕
Can't wait for trailer vs actual bugged gameplay comparison video
Thank god we finally have some better anit air stuff I just hope it’s balanced but fix’s air vehicles being overpowered
DONT TRUST ANY OF THIS
Lol still looks like a wasteland. No cover, no structure lol
WORK ON YOUR GAME, THE GAME IS STILL NOT FINISHED. Stop make extension and work on the game
That was it dude..?
Specialist is not we want
Im enjoying 2042 and looking  forward to seeing it improve and become the battlefield it was meant to be. Keep up the good work dice team.
FREE 2 PLAY
專家系統毀了這個系列! Expert Soldier systems destroy the battlefield!
Very excited to play
1 man 2 news vehicles 3 new weapons its still not enough
I still have more hope for this game than Halo Infinite.
Youtube removing dislike button counter for this occasion!
Hey can you add like more Detail to the game because that’s what most people are mad about and like add the distractibility like battlefield 4
Worst graphics ever be like in 2022 rework game pls
PR YOU GOT ME AGAIN  Now lets hope the actual game gets me too
Count this comment as a dislike 👎.
Well the gameplay didnt lie. You could clearly see a player locking on a heli and the heli just evaded and flew off. Just like in real gameplay.  Epic trailer as usual DICE. Hope the gameplay is as well this time.
Thought there were 3 trailers coming?
Those screaming refund before even seeing the first second of the trailer, hope you genuinely feel good about yourself one day
Only the inside will be fun to fight in probably
Zero Hour? More like Zero Players
Asked for class, they gave us new operator.
That was not a bad trailer, seems that you guys are finally adding in more weapons, and listened to our feedback about more cqc maps, Exposure looks promising, but I hope there's more content in season one that isn't tied to the Season Pass. Keep the Ball rolling!
THE HYPE
Looks insane!
ITS MORBIN TIME.
Mfs really working their hardest to put out the least amount of stuff possible 🗑
​MORBIUS✅BF2042✖
let this game die pls
Put this free to play , its a good way to make the game live again ...
Not bad
Is the battlefield 2042 going to be in the game pass or EA
I can’t believe we are only getting one map
Looks good to me. As long as we get consistent content, and the game runs smooth I'm happy!!!!!
wait ...what about portal?
as a new Battlefield 2042 content creator, i hope this update will do something to the game ❤
SQUAD, HELL LET LOOSE, INSURGENCY, SANDSTORM, play these, don’t play this poop and support the people who stole your money and ripped you off, play games that are fun and we’ll made, play games that have devs that listen to their community instead of going silent anytime there is an issue, ea’s investors would rather get a bag than have a good game franchise, do yourself a favor and ditch 2042
We will See ...nothing Else to say...I will never be hyped again by Marketing from eA and dice ...
That honestly isn’t much for 8 months of work. Not disappointed because my expectations were already low, just surprised that all DICE could do was one open map that’s had concept art in the files since launch, as well as skins and 2 weapons.
Here we go ! Ready to be let-down once again !
visually impressive as most battlefield stuff is but since this game started low i hope they can pull off a comeback
Looks promising. Like the Trailer of the game.
I totaly like the game
cool, one man and one weapon
Just get rid of the specialists, and this game will be a lot better
I remember the days when you got 4 maps, 6 weapons, 4 gadgets and a hell of a lot of challenges to complete. Now we get two weapons, one map and a specialist that nobody wants. Oh, and don't forget that it's tied to a 100-tier battlepass for a game with little to no content and nothing to do. I hate what gaming has become. It's not a hobby anymore, it's work.
The map reminds me bf4 dragon valley, it's been a while.
Still waiting for the beta stage to be end... can't wait to play the full game in 2023...!!!
Don’t be sad, This is just how it works out sometimes
Everyone go get it for 18$ ASAP!
Battlefield 3 feeling
This game always had great trailers and marketing, but in the development category, it falls completely flat, so we’ll see how this turns out
I’ll be honest the recent updates and patches they’ve made have improved the game imo but let’s be honest the current state of the game is probably the way it should have launched, but hopefully the DLC can help the franchise get back to where it needs to be
Граница каспия 2.0
The new helicopters look amazing and I’m glad they brought back player guided missiles  🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻 can’t wait to to play this
Map looks great but I think if you don't go free to play it's not going to matter
best thing in this reveal is last clip
Looks better then i thought, lets see June 9 boys. Im happy they keep trying
Really?... 7 months of nothing to just get 1 map, 1 specialist and 1 weapon.... Really?!! But the 100 tiers of the battlepass is in the game. This game is a joke.
Too bad this game is terrible and  season 1 came too late
What is it with this terrible open map design. Where is the detail and cover from BF3 maps or BF4….why is this so open 🙈🙈🙈have they learned nothing.
Still specialists?  See you in the next BF
One new map, One new specialist...? Are we getting the reworked maps in this Season or just One?
Decent trailer, but obviously not representative of actual gameplay footage, at all. We all know we don't get this much infantry action.
seriously 1 map and  as val from bf3 just reskinned and a crossbow from BF3 in 8 monts ????????
So let me get this straight we waited this long for only one map and only One new gun in a crossbow wow y’all guys been working so hard
🔥 🔥 🔥 Ill play this
Refund
I hope the personal tv missle is limited to maybe 2 per spawn.
1 specialist, 1 map, 2 helicopters, and 2 guns after nearly a year. So disappointing just trash the game like we know you will and move on already.
Great content just not enough still will continue to play because I love battlefield
seems good, don't drop the ball!
7 MONTHS FOR THIS 🤣🤣
nah thanks... again I can see huge map Not interested
locks great
F
When can I get a refund tho
hahaha to all those who give hate, I really hope they have a good life
Liberalism destroyed this franchise
Still no player statistics? Wow...
So as little as I play this game. I still have fun playing it. And I’m looking forward to the new content.
Please give me and my family's money back
remember, when we got 4 maps each DLC? ...yeah, that was fun
2,000 comments already, still so much interest for this game and so much dedication to our beloved franchise. I love the battlefield community so much, I’m pulling for this game but jeez. I just hope it doesn’t kill the franchise.
I don't care what anybody says I'm enjoying the game and I'm happy for the new season the devs literally published a roadmap that already shows the lack of content and it's ok when you have to spend a lot of your time fixing the game, of course there will be less new content at first
More ways for ppl to shoot down ur vehicle good job Dice
lookin' ffwd to get into this!
7 months of waiting just to get   1 new map (looks clean and dull)   1 new specialist (has a predator missile strapped to her arms)   and 2 new vehicles   Yippee😐
How tf does this have 4k likes?
Wow 1 new map
I’ve said this a hundred times ADD A TON OF WEAPONS no matter what just keep adding more weapons
ago 7 months ...... 2 guns ? 1 map ? Lol . What are they doing ? I would expect this from my wife's supper club who don't know how to develop games .
…and all the old bugs…
Wait, people still play this game?
I honest think if there was no specialist and just classes this game would be good
That new specialists is exactly what this game needed
Trailer 10/10 Game 3/10
Looks fun tbh but wont safe the game. Even less weapons than sw bf2...   2 weapons... this is a pure joke and why only one map?
mid
Too late
Well this actually was quite good. A new map, a new helicopter, new weapon and a new specialist. Its not much and i hope there are more than 2 weapons(which i dont expect) but it looks decent. Also it was mostly gameplay and not cinematic so its something to look forward to
*6-7 MONTHS of nothingness for a SINGLE new map, a few cosmetics, only 1 new operator and 2 whole new guns.. LMFAO*
I really have to ask, is that it? 1 new map after 8 months..... BF4 had 3 DLCs containing 4 maps each by this point after launch
*Battlefield 4 Remastered please*
Battlefield 2042 Season one: Zero content
Mhm
Cool, but it's all lies.
Very very cool im hype for the New season 🤩
We've seen this before. Will try it out, but not expecting much.
New map looks really good
Season 1: Zero Content
I just want 128 Breakthrough + original vehicle count back
Looks like "Refund Hour"
1 MAP REALLY???
This looks kinda good tbh
Everyone: We don't like specialist, please remove them. Dice: Release a trailer with a new specialist.
If this doesn't sell. dice should stop making games...
RIP Battlefield :/
This was actually it? Are you kidding?
2 guns and 1 map…….. 7 months. This is not a LETTER to the fans! It’s a disregard
I miss the dislike button 😢
meh
I Love BattleField2042
This should be free to play imo
buggerfield 🤣😂
Looks existing 👀
Dont forget BF4 had several DLCs by the time this game is releasing its FIRST season and content update. Bruh
8 MONTHS FOR 2 WEAPONS AND 1 MAP!!! Absolutely ridiculous.
MW2 MW2 MW2 !!!
I just hope mouse input lag will be fixed
It looks like a step in the right direction but this is still ea we’re talking about
Still waiting for a refund.... SIX MONTHS LATER
lol all the blind fanboys in these comments yeah wow 1 new map after 7-8 months holy cow
One new map....bravo
looks good but we waited 8 months for it so....
I mean the trailer, map, etc.. looks good but its so lacking that its sad
Only two weapons are you kidding me we need a new LMG not a crossbow no one asked for that
Too little too late… this game will be free soon anyways.
Man I hate specialists! 😒 gameplay overall looked pretty good though. We will see how it really plays
It's gonna suck.
Gritty, dark and post apocalypse lore and trailers... But once in the game this has no sense as you can see Angel fighting Angel...
that new specialist Rocket launcher needs to be nerfed before it lunches.  it looks slow and easy to control . don't put overpowered weapons in the game to bring back players . thats a big mistake
1:35 this was epic
i came here with no expectations but here i sit already disapointed . bravo DICE/EA you have made it abundantly clear that this game was over a year from launchable yet you released anyways knowing full well. congratulations it takes real guts to fail this hard
As someone who has been using the r5 to take down choppers and jets  I’m definitely going to main liz
LETS GO🔥🔥🔥
It’s good, right?
2 Mins of silence for those who paid 70$ for this. looool
Yes. the game is dead. Only thing that could have saved this game would have been a refund trailer, but instead we got 2 new helicopters, 2 new guns, 1 map and 1 specialist. Dice is but a ghost of its former self.
uuuufffffffff the trailer look amazing. finally the full version of the game. i hope it will be good!
no expectations at all
This looks promising can't wait battlefield 2042 buying battle pass automatically.
Ah yes. More vehicles
So i can assume your gonna fix the fact we cant hardly climb ladders since the last update, ground vehicles falling from the sky when you spawn in, bullets not registering, and most of all the ability to not wait 20 minutes to find a lobby and when you do it has 100 tickets left
Boring ~~~~~ one map What a joke
Cringe
Meh...... Maybe you should stop doing trailer and do the content for game, plus good job on the story telling........ Not!!!!!
Well that was quite mediocre…
Топ вышка !!!
Wow this update very sucks.
looks kool, but it's just ONE map, DLC's previously delivered 4
Let it die already
Not gonna lie, that map looks absolutely dope.
grappling the jet like whar
A scripted trailer wasn't the way, but at least the hook works
Was about to download again then found out you can't upgrade to the ps5 version of the game from ps4 with a physical copy. Not buying the game again.
They have ruined the vehicle gameplay it's absolutely diabolical now these battlefield Devs need stringing up
the last comment of the premier chat: Ouvinte :Þ ​so thats it
Looks great
Bf2042 is a really solid game, on ps5 its fire, im excited
Let’s be honest boys, it can’t get any worse.
I like it sucks gotta wait 2 days
8 miesięcy i totalne nic ha ha ha
Magnifique.
1 new map 2 new weapons and 1 specialist.
What did I just watch? 😩
looks like base game will have first real map
C R I N G E 👌
Lmao 1 map 1 operator both already available at launch but kept for season one. EA and Dice what's your problem ?
Zero content
Que basura de juego 1 mapa en 7 meses mapas sin sentido nafie lo juega otro juego muerto intentando revivir
Wow only one map xDDD
8 months live service = 1 map 2 weapons. Oh how i miss Premium. Youtubers said it splits the community, better than half the community now and AI bots.
Well, I'm glad my exceptions weren't too high.
I swear whoever they got making these trailers needs a raise, hopefully the game is like this in the update.
New map looks cool, same with the operator, but this really doesn't look like much. I hope we see titans at some point.
L
I spent 100$ on this so this season better be worth It
It seems that the map is to open :/ hopefully it isnt
what have battlefield become… all these years, to this?.. hopefully this will save the game
Remove the specialists
Wow what a shame
1 map and 2 new helicopters after 7 months of waiting.. im sorry but this game is done for
One new map?
Умоляем, только в этот раз не обострилась!!!))
Battlefield trailers are awesome but the game not so much
ゴミMAPで草
WHATS THE POINT OF LAUNCHING THE UPDATE IF WE CAN'T PLAY WITH ANYTHING NEW FOR 2 MORE DAYS?
Can't wait to try it out!!!!!!
The amount of content here is abysmal
Как жалко что это все только картинка...
After watching the trailer I can confirm that the game is indeed not making a comeback
2 new weapons and a field... wow so cool dice
There’s nowhere to go from here but up so I hope this starts the revival process for this game
Can't be any worse than what the game currently is so, cool.
That’s it? All this time to release 1 specialists 2 weapons and 2 helicopters and 1 map?!? Specialists are the biggest problem with this game
Hell yaaaa! Come onnnn Thursday
After 7 months only 1 Map and 2 weapons, this is so embarrassing and insulting.
Get a server browser in there already jeez
love this game best battlefield since 3 and 4. hated abhorred the garbage that were bf1 and bf5 this game is outstanding for a bf game. follow me on twitch xEpicSurvivorx
Why , just why? You could’ve added a BF4 Portal , you could’ve fixed the buggy mechanism, you could’ve made mil slims , but nope new operator , new helicopters , and a map , and a explosive crossbow and as Val ripoff
nahhh not impressed more overpowerd vehicles is not what this game needs
+ 0.1 respect for doing something .
2022 triple A studio trailer in 1080p????? We can do better half the trailer was a countdown come on dice
So one new map, a helicopter one or two weapons and a new character? And they squeezed in the battle pass to milk already dead game for whatever is left of it absolutely shameful did they actually fix any of the game breaking issues or things the community has been complaining about? Mostlikely not
Meh 😒, this is all?
They should call this "Zero Hours Gameplay", because thats what it will be for 90% of the owners from release. Biggest flop in BF history.
RIP Battlefield.
Super sad That this is everything they did in 10 months tbh…

Oh god not another battlepass, do you really think you even deserve to ask for more cash?  What a load of nothing. All this time and we get 1 whole map, 2 weapons, a specialist and... Nothing else of note?
HOW DO YOU HYPE A MOMENT AND ONLY GIVE US A 1MIN VIDEO?!
Too quick
Well we just witnessed the death of Battlefield. SMH
The new map feels empty once again..
Welp, that was sad
Interesting how THIS is what EA DICE come up with after 7 months of radio silence…😅😅😅
It's a start, I guess
The only saving grace this game has is completely abolishing the idea they'll make any more money off of it, getting rid of their pass, and taking away operators and replacing them with a class system we all know and love. This might be too embarrassing for Dice and EA to admit though.
Refund
It's just not enough.
Nice map, looks fun.
W
most "meh" trailer ever
Boring
You had your last chance to save your game, I think this is officially dead.
I felt nothing....
Boring ~~~~~
I hope they have fixed the input delay on last gen ...
that's gotta be the saddest trailer I have seen in all my gaming years.
Ground TV
ONE WHOLE NEW MAP TWO NEW WEAPONS AND TV MISSILE LETZ GOOOOOOO
Please, return my money!
that looks pretty awesome.
The new guided rocket actually seems like a good addition, the map "looks" cool but we'll see the other ones looked cool in the trailers too, still seeing a lack of cover though from the trailer
Don't need to be a genius to notice that a portable TV missile is going to be completely broken a make air vehicles even more useless than they already are.
Nice another map with 0 cover LUL
And Thats all???? After such a long time??? sad
Mdrrrrrrrrrrr c'est nul
zero content
They didn't even try. cmon
2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL 2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL 2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL 2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL 2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL 2 NEW GUNS OMEGALUL
Bigger maps, doesnt mean better maps. Should have worked on the base game before making this update.
The map seems cool. If only the rest of the game wouldn't be the mess that it is
نه
Now they just need to fix the game,fix the maps and make the next-gen upgrade free for the people that pre-ordered
REFUND
i wish i had bought the game for 20$ when nobody wanted to play it
Woooohhoooooo! Amazing...       Refund please.
replace specialist bring back class system or have an option to play as the class system but also more destructiveness needed
new rocket launcher is awesomeee
Somehow EA still manages to disappoint me
This was actually good  Taking steps in the right direction..!
REFUNDFIELD
If anything... DICE is really good at trailers! Looking forward to it!
1 map and 2 guns after 8 months
Are these grapfics 2014 ???? Or is it just me? I don't think so
The big comeback!
Pls option to Upgrade old Gen to Next Gen
Not bad I suppose
It’s a decent start but it still needs more content. Let’s hope they can continue adding and updating
So much talent at DICE but the worst senior management EVER.
Just watched the trailer..... New specialist adds a new goofy face that ruins the atmosphere of the game..... why couldn't they give her a helmet or something.....  Edit: also 0 content.
worse than hardline
I felt a bit underwhelmed with this. New choppers are good but no attack jets like a Warthog which is a shame.
Atleast Dice know how to make a trailer
It has to get worse before it gets better and it got worse so it's time for it to become better
That's it folks
RIP
👏😉 Ok, not disappointed 👍one map is few but okay
ABSOLUTE TRASH
Operation Zero content
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This game will make a comeback like they did with Battlefront 2
this honestly look good except specialists and the core gameplay
اقول خلوها مجانية بس
Looks promising, let's hope Season 1 and future seasons deliver what we expect from DICE and Battlefield.
BEAUTIFUL
BOO!!
So much time...for this?
Bruh
Well,, This is promising 👍
L
Tell you what, update Battlefield 1 with new maps and anticheat and ill forgive you Dice.
1 new gun lmao
Kinda cool, but not enogh
So boys what y’all think ?🤔
Awesome 👏 Looking good!
Dissapointing :(
Zero Hour more like Zero content. 2 weapons after 6 months....
120€ gone
REFUND!!!!
Wow that was like the weakest BF2042 trailer yet
This is pathetic for a AAA studio
lmao what a waste of time
Rest in Peace Battlefield, we made a lot of good memories over the years...
They won’t joking with 1 map and no content lol
Lmao this is a joke right?
Wait where is update to fix this game?
Trailer looks fun as always. But don’t get fooled
Get rid of Specialists and I'll consider playing this trash
Ojala se vea así y no nos lamentemos después..
😬
USE ME AS THE DISLIKE BUTTON
Very cool content. Wish we had a few more maps though. Especially by now
This has a lot of potential. SO USE IT!
THAT'S IT????
After 7 months we have.... 2 new weapons 1 specialist  2 helicopters 1 map
1 new map? lol
Ok that was cool but where's the portal maps promised with each season
Please don’t let me down.
Well
Esto es pura mie
Looks awesome
1 Map is just not enough after 8 Months of nothing
Looks good
Looks really good
That was disappointing.
I missed my AT4 and SRAW.  Time to add more helicopters. Because you're all going down!
😒
Terrible
bruh the game been out for how long??? one new map??????? come on guys
still no all chat lol what a mess of a game
Deep Rock Galactic so much better than Battlefield. Eff BF...
Win
It was cool
REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND
Fair enough
That's what they were hyping up??? 🤣🤣
the maps just as open as the others 😑
Lame
wow, 1 map everyone
1 map?maaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn
Ouch. The map looks great. But the lack of content is oif
“What is it” hope
bad
worst than ever
Eso es todo después de un día entero en la pantalla para esto?
A battlepass? Really?
Eu vim ver o 🐒
Meh.
1 new map
Haha that it, looks just as bad, never seen any real game play like that
✌
Ok
Actually looks pretty sick
Nice
Meh🤷🏽
they never cease to disappoint me
Awesome!
Awesome
Honestly not dissaappointed
why a battle pass 😐
This is embarrassing
POGGERS
Let’s goo😤🔥
So what are the new guns exactly?
LAME
nice so nice
Wow, that looks like it will be boring as hell.
cool map
Can't wait for them to nerf all that 🤡
It did look good but not a lot of content at all
Yikes
Not bad
2,3K dislikes guys, lets improve that number.
Ok that last scene was kinda cool
XDD
I want my money back 😡🤬
Bro 1 gun

Ахуенчик ! Атвичаю

Sad
Handheld TV missles look fun.
Trash game
You know she's a strong independent woman with all the unnecessary yelling & grunting she's doing.
Too little, too late.
Want my refund
Refund DLC Soon pls 🙏🙏
I hope you guys at EA DICE know thats your very last chance..
💀💀💀💀
REFUND
Great more coutdowns
let's go boys
Estoy giñando
if i dont see levelution or destruction and more rugged gamplay after this update, then yeah battlefield officially burried themselves
2 guns and 2 useless vehicles (should've been Attack Jets) 1 map and yet another specialist.. wonderful
Ngl i love the glitch aesthetic of this game
Lets goo
I’m drug now, better give me some good news
Openfield 2042
REFUND
I fully expect the trailer to be awesome. The content on the other hand I expect to be disappointing.
REFOUND MONEY NOW
LETS GOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
best battlefield game
Honestly Firestorm as a free to play and the operators would be bundled would save this game leaving the core game with classes is a win win
BE LIKE SHROUD JUST DELETE THIS GAME!!!
REFUND
I'm happy I wasn't dumb enough to buy this game, this is the first battlefield game I skipped.
SpongeBob squigglepants is one of the greatest games of all time
How about after Zero  Hour, we get One Refund?
Trailer delayed for 7 months
Last chance 🙏
Imm
Bad 🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮
Zero Content
🤡🤡🤡
买都买了，只能希望越来越好了
If they take away specialists imma be so happy
Lol
Let’s goooo🙏🏽
And now Show the World the biggest switch and drop of the gaming industrie
Modern Warfare 2 Killer
Time for another specialist gadget that u can give to a random soldier and nothing would change
who even cares anymore
why is everyone staying in the stream just to hate it, hating stuff takes so much energy
Finger hovering over the delete button
just took them almost a year to bring new stuff to the game lol. imagine
Well, at least the trailer will be cool.......... I guess
Looking for new recruits for my squad. I am looking forward to working with you.
It can't possibly get any worse right?    right?
dont let battlefield franchise die！！！
Here's hoping the trailer shows the killing off of the specialists 🤣
Morbius
Singel player camapign coming up?`So we know wtha tha hell this is.
🇫🇷🇫🇷🇷🇪🇷🇪
Companies have been taken over by lefties who care more about the politics than the game itself…
SAGENHAFT😂
Trailer most likely will ve good but hows real gameplay?
Lets add some new bugs
Um Is anyone else facing server issues?
welcome to zero content
Refund é meu ovo!!!
lets hope this makes the game actually a game
SO EXCITED! LOVE THE GAME
MORBIN TIMME
1 NEW MAP = DISGRACE & COMMUNITY ANGER
Can't wait for Act Man's "Why is Battlefield 2042 Zero hour so bad"?
Always had fun with the game
Fingers crossed, i have faith in dice
Ебать, спустя столько времени может завезу контент
EA KILLED BATTLEFRONT AND BATTLEFIELD.
Lets see if they're still ruining battlefield.
I don't care, I'm hyped. 2042 is good, it just needs more content.
There's only 2 new weapons
Let's grow up!
ZERO HOUR‼︎🍻🍻🍻
I hope the quality of the game will improve! dice!
I'll be the laughing emoji.
I haven't playeded in ages so they better show off something that will actually bring players back... And add 2142 in Battlefield Portal, come on now, we need it.
Challenge accepted: go further than rock bottom
The game is not that bad... I don't understand the complaints. Sure it's not perfect but I'm having fun playing the game rn. Just need some small fixs.
When the platoons?
Egal was ihr noch groß ankündigt es bleibt im Müll Eimer
Dice just give up on this game and start working on new Battlefield.
I forgot I was actually subscribed.. I guess I’ll have to check it out then
where is server browser?!
I left a dislike 😌 just because what dice has done to battlefield feels personal to me
We all here waiting for yet another disappointment 😆
Mehh idk not interested, see ya in 2023 for BF7
Please, EA. Prove yourself that his game can rise up an become something worth playing!
Arghhhhh
zero content
zero content
BF 4 was better than this
Cool trailer. Can I get a refund?
All 12 fans will be blown away
I thought they going to remake commander and conquer zero hour but EA will be forever suck
1 map, 1 specialist, 2 gun and 2 helicopter (well one for each team so one with two different skin)  So much content after 8 month, thanks dice !
This needs to be some top tier content else the game is gonna struggle even more
I bet you can destroy the game even more
You can't go down from rock bottom right?
I'm praying that this saves the game. I think Battlefield 2042 is ok, but it could use some improvements. One improvement I wanna see is more destruction. In Battlefield 4 you can knock down an entire skyscraper but in 2042 there is almost no destruction.
Dice is such a disgrace
Please save this game, and give us a new 2142 while youre at it.
برو
I’m not sorry, I want them to fail, even if it means that this franchise is gone. You can’t scam people out of their money by offering content at the beginning of the year and not fully delivering on that. I mean come on, 2 weapons and 1 map for the first season of this game is flat out a joke.
I cannot wait for this game to flop so hard and lose everyone at Dice/EA a load of money.
Game is good just needs some polish, most bf games take at least 6 mouths b4 there good anyways (i.e. BF4)  people cry too much over a video game, play it or don't its that simple.....
Can't WAIT !! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please don’t break my heart again… I can’t take it lol
If the base game is beyond saving theres not much a dlc can do...
Is this paid content with the season pass on free? I'm not putting money in
THIS GAME IS DEAD!
I'm sure it's going to be 20% gameplay and 80% introduction to loot boxes, season pass, and garbage skins.
refund
*Confirmed* only 3 new guns 😒
Really ? No performance patches,no stability fixes,no hardware optimization ?  Tells you alot about their priorities as a business
to late mw2 drops tomorrow 🥰🥰
Zero hour❌ Zero content ✅
Moment of truth everybody. It either all ends here, or becomes the new beginning.
Yes finaly
It is your last chance .Please bring something good.
Exodus Conquest was a great idea, hopefully you follow those steps and bring more Portal stuff into the main game to make up for the lack of content.
Whatever is this it's going to be destroyed by tomorrow 😅😅😅😅
There's only 2 new weapons I look at it in the main menu when I started up battlefield a hour ago this season 1 zeroe hour is trash 🗑
A fart in the wind.
I got the game about a month ago or so and I actually truly enjoy it🤷🏻‍♂️
Yall crying about how horrible the game is but yet still commenting on here worried about the new update and still playing it 😣😫😂😂😂
No upgrade from ps4 to ps5?
Hope somethings change.
This season needs to have alot of portal content, as its been confirmed there isn't much for the AOW. If there aint alotta portal content, and more AOW content during season 2. This game will probably be dead by the time MW2 arrives
After hearing the rumors that there will be 1 new map and specialist, and 2 new guns and helicopters, I’m so happy that I never bought this game.
Lo único que espero es encontrar personas de mi consola sin usar cross-play
Awesome... record broken. Here are more players waiting for the trailer than playing the dirty game.
God I can't wait to be disappointed for the 2042nd time
Hope it gets fun i liked the game i played it bugs just got too borring
I cant wait to see them pull out the diamond bit auger and dig this hole even deeper
Absolute hype, time to improve on mistakes and make this the best BF to date.
Hopefully we can turn cross play off now .... but doubt it
If only ea kept all the original  dice devs and didn't force them to send unfinished  games out all due to money/share holders.  EA there's a big difference between a polished and finished game an GREED we as players are the reason you make money start treating us right.
Refund?
Activision is watching brah
Battlefield Season 1: Zero Players
This Dice is zero credibility.
TWO NEW TRASH WEAPONS AFTER HALF A YEAR. GG EA DICE
Well, they already have our money, BF2042 has made me think seriously about any future pre-order, SUCH a disappointment
Hopes high, expectations *low*
1 new map and 2 new guns on a SEASON 1?!?!
Lol 7 months for this.... argh what happened to games
Idc about the hate bf 2042 gets I'm just here for the guns
1k only and it took 8 months for this to finally happen. Sad
Trailer is gonna be a 10/10, gameplay is gonna be like a 4/10 as always
The AI get a "tank" in hazard zone?
Really looking forward to some new content.  This game could be really good,  it may take some time but I haven’t lost faith.
Hahahahahaha after amlost 1 year 🤣🤣🤣
just give us a refund.
Good update😊 im wait season 1 🔥
2 new weapons has to be the funniest joke ever told by a AAA studio 🤣 😂 😆
Nerf shotguns, smgs and lmgs
Knowing dice and especially using battlefront 2 and bf5 as examples this is the start of the game getting good  Update: called that this would look sick
I want my money back!
Those who still comment about the game are so hypocrites. Just unsubscribe and move on with your life if you do not like it.
Generally disappointing seen everything leaked on Twitter and this is a sad excuse for S1 it's over for this game
Make me buy the game again after my 120€uro refund.
zzzz
I hope this update will be good. I'll buy this game if its review becomes more positive
Keep on the good work 💟
New number one disliked video on YouTube incoming?
Wonderful. You will see trash move soon
If the dislikes were shown, this would probably be the most disliked video on youtube considering what type of fanbase gamers create these days
Battlefield and Medal of Honor 🪦🪦😭💔
Fix ur game
Bring back Battlefield 4 vibes 😩
it's horrible how in two different factions there is the same specialist with the same skin. feels like killing a clone
enjoy this moment when they come
Hee hee! did I go too far
today today im proud
Angel does it again
okay i hope its free :)
日本人いる？笑
Refund me. I was scammed
i will never lose hope on this game
1 map 2 helocopters (likely US and Russian versions of the same vehicle 2 guns  1 specialist  Thats all folks!
Oh man I truly hope this is a step to the right direction... Even it's just a small step
All right man you have to add a new drone
Everybody, do not get hyped for anything in this trailer until we have the contents in our hands. One new map and a few new weapons is not enough.
🤔
People keep forgetting about bf4.... it was a mess for over a year.... 2042 is half a year & its doing better than bf4 did... besides the fact bf4 had 3 dlc's already & heaps of guns tho 😆
Give Server Browser!!!! People in third world countries has it the worst because we can't even find a match but theyre eating nicely with our money.
☆☆☆☆MODERN WARFARE II☆☆☆☆
a day before full reveal of MW2
Cmon dice you can fix it 🔥😤
Wait...season 1 is out today? :o
hope..but not much..we'll see...
Game plays like Apex, that cant be fixed just updating, remaster bf3 and 4 together
Just looked this morning at the new update as of 9am GMT. We have 1 New Specialist, 2 Weapons (a Marksman Rifle and a Crossbow), 1 New Map, a Smoke Grenade Launcher, 2 Helicopters. Pathetic content release. We genuinely have been waiting 8/9 months for some form of DLC, and you guys have gave us the bare minimum after the biggest farce and charade to steal passionate, die-hard fans money. The deception, manipulation, and toxicity is insulting to everyone who stood by this franchise. You are all nothing but a disgrace. You insult people like myself, who want to work in the gaming industry to help develop memorable, immersive, escapist experiences that give players fidelity, customization, personalization, happy memories with friends and a level of achievement/satisfaction that acts as a reward upon investment. 2042 is beyond saving, your abysmal player count says all. We have lost faith. in you. Nothing could repair this fractured relationship. You shook with one hand and stabbed us in the back with the other countless times. I tried to get into a game 5 times today, and it couldn't even find the base threshold of 16 players to start the lobby... It's an utter disgrace.  Look at Battlefront 2015 for your benchmark in graphics. The photo-mapping. The attention to detail. Look at Battlefield 3 & 4, for your best immersive experiences. How do you fall from grace? I understand that the board, the publishers, investors, stockholders, and owners all have a vice grip on the creatives, but ironically, when you aim to please the investors, you make a poor game, and they don't make the profits they glutton for. But if you make a game, that is a testimonial to the fans, you make an experience like no other, and it becomes profitable.
Last chance battlefield…….
Battlefield V had a definitive edition upgrade which included all the stuff from the tedious and never ending weekly objectives that could only be completed during appropriate specific week and never again, without any non-greedy catch up mechanic. It's safe to assume that nobody should play this game for the first two years when you constantly experience content droughts and are forced to do weekly objectives that will go away along with their respective rewards a week later and do this for over a year when you can avoid all that buy an upgrade two years later when it's released. I'm pretty sure Battlefield 2042 will have it's own definitive edition upgrade and editions just like BFV and Battlefront II. I quit BFV and don't want to go back but If I knew this piece of information before I wouldn't even pre-order BFV and I would be enjoying it today with all the maps they added and with all the stuff people were chasing weekly like morons for a cheap definitive upgrade and could peacefully just enjoy the game without any dumb grind.
Gimme something good to stay and keep playing 🤞🤞
I think that people, psycologically, are awaiting a complete rework of the game which has already launched and sold to most people that would have bought it. There's no monetary drive for EA as people can pick it up so cheap 9 months after launch. Don't expect too much here and let's hopefully look forward to the next one in a few years.
Im optimistic AF. I want this to be another BF4. Right now its the best BF experience and they fixed it after a bad start... i hope...
Probably five thousand fixed have been released since the premiere. How can you publish a game like this? :D
I've heard there's only 2 new guns and 1 new map, really hope that isn't the case.
They took everything vet players said and did the opposite. They shouldve learned from BF5. Maybe now there will be less quadriplegic women fighting on the frontlines and more actual map design. Hell, there are several roblox games and indie trials who have 10x the fps fanbase this game has. And with Reforger coming out, they lost most of the more hardcore/milsim shooter fans too.
People still play this game
Hopefully seen as that they been under the radar for while and surprises with some stellar content that we don’t know about but that’s just wishful thinking. Looking forward to seeing what’s in store for us who still play the game .
You guys are hyped for one map, one weapon and one skin...
I already paid $150 for this game, and it was all down hill from there. You get it?
Should just make the game free at this point
It better has tons of new maps and a proper class system but it's already known that it won't have that.
Battlefield trying to be rainbow six siege
Even with all the criticism (much of it warranted) including from myself, I have been enjoying the game. I'm glad to see they still care about it.
garbage content/
Just remaster battlefield 1 and go from there lol its never gonna get any better than that
Finally after half of a year we have some new content for year 1 pass owners. Good job... Does it mean we're going to have half of our money back?
Keep your expectations low and you never be disappointed
430 people waiting ? Shouldn't this be in the 1000's ?
There's more comments here then people currently playing the game 💀
360 Invictus or Comanche. What would it be?
Lets all just hope and pray they actually finished the season before releasing it
Instead of putting money and time into trailers, they should put their money and time into actual development of the game
Its just biggest comeback 💪.. atleas i hope 👍. Just wait what there will be..
Still going to be trash
Map Rotation please!!!!!!!
No one re install this game when this drops and especially don’t buy the battle pass. We must show dice and Ea they can’t scam us anymore.
This game is a fraud
Check out my battlefield 2042 videos btw
This is gonna be dope
there's no way that the game can get worse   right?
one new map lmao, can you give us a refund
I need a huge list of things to even consider this game “ready”  - Longer list of weapons in base game (not counting any portal weapons) - Longer list of attachments that are diverse - Shorter maps - reworked maps with more cover - Better environmental damage - Something else other than a tornado - General balancing - rewards or something to actually keep me playing for more than 1 game  Besides, if that can’t be given after a 9 month wait for the FIRST season, I’m just gonna go get hyped for MW2. Then again, I probably still wouldn’t download it because my disappointment is immeasurable.
battlefield is dead.
Nah, return to Battlefield V, add the soviets and stuff, at least people will play it
Zero player gameplay
I’m both excited and let down. Let’s hope this update is good.
MORE DISLIKES!!!!
Zero hours gonna play this
Last chance to save battlefield 2042 from death to alive
We are gonna get a huge new patch that will change the game dramatically cant wait to play it and watch this trailer
If there will be good reloading animations and normal scoreboard and less bugs in this new season then I'm good, but who am I kidding. Say whatever you want but I loved BF5 since launch, (even tho it's not historically accurate), and I still do. It's fun to play, and that's more matters.
Cash grab
This better save the game
Please don't be bad.
Ready to be disappointed
This is either gonna be a saving grace for the game or it’s somehow gonna sink even more
I have to say, I was SOOOO excited when it was announced, SOOOO excited when it had almost released, and then SOOOO disappointed when it finally did…  So please make this good 🫥
at this point, i just want to see how far the trainwreck can go
bf2042 is still unplayable for me due to lag and horrible server selection. what a waste of money!
Re-installed Bf2042 a few days ago after 4 months break. I hope, they fix the game and put in a lot of content. This game has so much potential!
Adding seasons now are we? Any consideration i had for buying this games an outstanding no know. I hope this loss takes EA under. Graphics are not the only level of immersion and the sooner the devs put their foot down to the expectations of their superiors the sooner these mis managed games will get better.
Gekaufte Kommentare ^^ naja meinen Dislike Segen haben sie eben erhalten
While your at it, reduce the amount of specialist on a team to 1 per squad and have all the other players play as the soldiers from the trailer.
The only trailer I want from this game is one that announces refunds
my money....
This game will have my full respect if they actually pull it off.
Por favor dice  yo quiero disfrutar de battlefield :(
You're one of a kind.
More bad news? I hope not 🥺
The positive part (for me) about this first Season is that i have extremely low hopes.
Why does not you even refer to your own past works?
Just here to remind myself that I preordered this game
Way to late guys sorry u tried and failed us make way for MW2 the real MVP
DICE if you reading this I want you to consider my ideas to be next to upgrade and update to the game, I like specialist, but I also like the old class system. So... Why don't you bond two system together like you did with Battlefront 2, it makes more sense to pick class first then when we have enough points we can call in specialist. I love the concept of Hazard Zone, in my opinion I want to use that money that I got from extract to buy skins for free in the Boin shop, make it a grind experience for us to the Hazard Zone mode, then make the skin weekly so we have a things to do in the Hazard Zone. Thank you in advance.
Only one new map after 7 months? I'm fine.
No 128 player breakthrough well im not coming back. You took away something people paided for what a joke.
The time has come. Give the game for free. Zero hour is upon us.   Even tho, I hope the game isn't as bad as it was at launch.
plz, should be better..!!
hoping a great performance!!!
At this point the best part about the Battlefield franchise is the marketing team 😂
Took you long enough
Re-installed Bf2042 a few days ago after 4 months break. I hope, they fix the game and put in a lot of content. This game has so much potential!
Wheres the button to make sure I never see this or anything battlefield related ever again?
traigo comeson en un huevo
Don't be sad, this is just how it works out sometimes
The time has come. Give the game for free. Zero hour is upon us.   Even tho, I hope the game isn't as bad as it was at launch.
Captain Haddock (Capitaine) / Boris won't be anymore XD
Влятли этой игре что-то поможет... Тем более завтра выходит сайкл 😋
You have cute elbows. For real.
Everyone keeps saying how bad this is and how terrible they are but imagine that maybe they have feelings and are actually trying as you sit in your gaming chairs complaining to a multimillionaire company over a game you couldn’t make especially being rushed by 20 million people to finish it and delayed it once already like they are fixing this they just need TIME and SUPPORT from their only fan base like just give it time and faith and hope and maybe this’ll be a good game which I highly think is possible
Espero que no sea tan malo como su lanzamiento, es imposible superarlo aunque ustedes son expertos en eso.
my expectations are low,well i suppose you really can't go further downhill
The positive part (for me) about this first Season is that i have extremely low hopes.
Wow, after 6+ months we finally new get content. “We are way ahead of schedule.”
Needs to be big, massively upset that we’re only getting one new map though. This season is literally make or break to claw back the players
Just give up already.
I am playing Battlefield five and I completed my tides of war and the reward was 1000 Company coins. It says added  to my wallet But I don’t see it in my wallet
Don't Be sad, This is just how it works out sometimes
If there isn't enough content and fixes for this to be a strong "relaunch", then there's no saving this game anymore.
YUCK 🤢
Early access Alpha going to Beta?
*Marketing team talking about 128 players Devs: *64 Players Locked For Zero Hour
I expect this to bring in even more bugs
We need TDM
trash game
let's gooo i can't wait !
Can't wait for this update to completely break the game more than it is😁
Literally no one asked for this game to have "seasons" you people will never learn. Go back and play BF1,4,3 and take notes on what people actually like
Pls EA, we're all waiting for battlefield 2042 so please, make it great so we will
Yay, finally the Alpha is coming to an end, Hope the Zero Hour Beta is better. Cant wait for the full launch in Soon June Boom 2023.
oh no
Zero Hour is the amount of time most players did on this game until now
The zero is for zero effort
Redeem yourself like how no man's sky did.
NERF. THE. CONDORS AND HINDS. understood?
Expect the best prepare for the worst:(
Jack frags can’t wait to do a video saying: BF42 is actually amazing on season 1 🤣
Never buying another game from you again congrats
Stop removing air attack vehicles. air superiority needs to stay
Started Playing Insurgency Sandstorm. I have a new go to game. BF2, BC1,BC2, BF3, BF4,BF1, BFV, were all good the best being 4 and earlier. 2042 nothing is lethal no one dies, it garbage.
I'm loving it, can't wait for people to ruin it for me.
Oh snizzap
don't be sad , this is just how it works out sometimes
Expecting those map changes fr fr
Hopefully it's actually not ZERO HOURS of me playing it again
is the game also being fixed or is it just a season update I've lost faith in battlefield
I wonder how this will compare to mw2 2022 trailer.
refund trailer
It’s to late us hardcore fans left millenniums ago
Can you please put campaign in battlefield 2042
There better be more Bad Company 2 maps coming with this. That's all I care about
expect dissapointment , then you wont be dissapointed
zero hour? more like zero players
almost forgot i wasted 150 bucks, thanks youtube for reminding me again.
This will be the make it or break it for EA/Dice
No thank you!
Please be bad and stop supporting these people. You are supporting this practice of release and fix later. Let it die
This is your last chance to do SOMETHING, I honestly don't have any expectations, DICE & EA killed Battlefield
finally a reason to play the game other than a b3anie
Maybe this will add splash damage so i cant actually use tanks
Must be the "LiVe SeRvIcE" EA/DICE be hyping up 🤡
Nobody cares about the new season 💀
Give me more Reasons not to buy this game, such a let down... Can't wait to see this lol
Any longer and it would be Zero Players.
I think not very good
★転★換★点★
1 Specialist 2 Weapons 2 Helicopters 1 Map  Media/content creators can't even play the new content to record content cause there are errors, this is what we get? I miss the DICE of the old days.
Anything new for Portal? I really need BF1 and add peacekeeper for who is already unlock it in BF1
Battlefield 2042: Season 01 Zero Players
This game is so dead people got bored of talking about it being dead.
Is this game havn't dead yet? What is the reason keeping your expectation? More microtransaction?
1 Specialist 2 Weapons 2 Helicopters 1 Map  Media/content creators can't even play the new content to record content cause there are errors, this is what we get? I miss the DICE of the old days.
After this "Trailer" they will tell us : "Don't be sad, this is just how it works out sometimes..."
WAKE UP
R.I.P
DO SOMETHING!
Please be good
Battlefield you need to revamp all the new maps to 2.0 in one go  Revamping maps one at a time is rubbish
This is your last last straw dice. Screw this up and it’s over. PS great idea to announce this right as your biggest competitor is revealing one of the most hyped games ever.
I Think IT Will Be Best Game in THE Next 3 Years For Bf community...
Please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good
WOOOOOOO YEEEEEEEAH GUYS
no one cares
Who would ever buy a game from them on day or week one again? Wait about 4 weeks and pick it for $20.. This was the case for the last 2 Battlefields games and it seems to be the trend.
to late, nobody is playing your game anymore
It’s probably going to be one map, a couple of guns, then followed by game modes.
Here's a fact, it's gonna be bad 😂🤦.
It should honestly just come out tomorrow. I feel like that would get more people interested in it than a trailer.
Do our Battle Pass progress if we play all-out warfare (multiplayer/solo and co-op), hazard zone, and PORTAL?
Despite everything, I am excited about this.
Where is the official Refund trailer?
I wish you go further with bfv, add the Russians, add more weapons like the panzerschrek or Springfield rifle, add more cool realistic cosmetics, add more tanks like a panther etc. Pls do that, bf2042 is dead, bfv has so much more players. Just add more to bfv. I beg you
Imagine wasting money on this trashcan
new color Theme? i hope tho
Just tell us that classes are back and that the maps got fixed and everyone will be happy
Is this the opportunity for me to start making content again ?
LOOK HOW THE GONNA DISAPOINT US
If Tom Henderson is right about the content in this update I hope there’s legal action taken against dice
Just update battlefield V or battlefield 1. I like battlefield 1 more but there isn’t too much left to do so update battlefield V. Heres some map ideas. D-day, Okinawa, Stalingrad and berlin
Y'all clapped my cheeks one time TOO MANY
Please don’t let us down this time
Yeah too late mate
Haha who cares about this still
Zero Hour more like zero hours of patience left
God there’s so much riding in this, please don’t turn out to be a disappointment
Cringe
Could battlefield No Man's Sky it?
Ofc make seasons. Follow in the footsteps of every other game. Just stop.
I hope they add QBZ-95 and AM-17 into the game.
Already a thumbs down for adopting the “season” thing
I've got the lowest expectations I've ever had from any game. Dice, this Season will be hard to f*** up, but some how I think you'll manage it.
prepare the bell of shame
What a time to be dead !
Only one map after 7 months. Pathetic.
The bots will love this
Gonna bring the game from Alpha to Beta phase now
Wow, People actually cares about this thing???
Please don't be trash on top of trash
Here before they disable comments
The game is dead
Stop the "Seasons" trend
Can companies stop releasing games when they're not ready???
Too bad YouTube deleted the dislike counter. This would be dislike gold.
no
We want our money back!
Hours before the stream, my predictions: 1 horrible and open map A specialist with horrible personality 1 new weapon
Watch this update add literally 1 map to the game, which ironically was probably removed from the base game to be used as "content" in Season 1.
Bro,if they don't fix the game,they're history,so if they want their communtity to be big,they'll have to make the bp good enough for players to buy itamd also fix bugs.
It's Battlefield V all over again. This will be a trailer full of hype, but the game will remain starved of content.
Season 1?! isn't this game pushing a year old?
i dont care
I hate you Dice and EA
make BF3, BF4, Hardline for Mobile !
Let’s hope this one’s better
Bruh... No one cares anymore.
Please do not make clown stuff in this game
Seems like the "Hour" is synonymous to its amount of current players
Drive it like you stole it.  Knock us out.  The last patch has finally showed that perhaps they are in better hands with Vince.  But this HAS to be good.
hahaha flop
EA makes great trailers.  I will leave it at that.
It is to late for battlefield especially this one
Does anybody even cares about this game any more its a shame that they just  droped battlefront 2
Sad to say but im back to see the trailer cuz they know how to make great trailer.
Zzz Zzz Zzz
RIP
Battlefield 3 remastered
Please be decent
I still havent found this "Love letter to the fans." They spoke of prior to release.
I expect an epic trailer that does not represent the real product, as they always do.
Expectations are about as low as they can be rn, guess that means it'll be hard to be disappointed
Ahh yes, Kill off Sunderance's EMP grenade🖕because since DICE EA is in America.  This is America.  🤎🔫🎲📧A
It's going to release and be terrible. If you get hyped for this trailer, you are a fool and part of the problem. Battlefield 3 received multiple full DLC's by this time, complete with weapons, assignments, multiple maps, and on top of that....... the game actually worked. Season 1 will fix nothing, add almost nothing, and be predictably underwhelming. Cope and seethe
Fail Hour
Zero Hour that’s funny because that’s exactly how much I’ll be playing 2042 from now on
we shouldn't expect anything. They dont have many devs on bf 2042 anymore, becouse they already have to develop the next game. Updating bf 2042 is just not cost effective anymore. You can realy get more money with updating it.
Remember don't trust them.
Что там у нас, аж 1 новая карта и прекращение поддержки лучшего, что в ней есть - portal? Жду не дождусь просто.
So 2 new weapons, 2 new helicopters, 1 map, and 1 specialist is all they can give us after 8 months of their live service multiplayer game. Zero Hour should've been renamed to Zero Content.
This game is dead. Please just kill it.
не облажайтесь
Go back to BFV or Battlefront 2.
How you can not understand...? WE DON'T WANT SPECIALISTS
The trailers weren't ever the problem guys.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The only direction this game can go is up
Can't wait for ALL THE LIES🚫
Yoo the beta finally released, maybe this will be like BfV where the game is good after the next one is released
A little too late fellas.
Season 1 should had been released along time ago Looks promising though
BF2042: When you reach rock bottom, bring a jackhammer and keep digging
Good thing I stopped playing this game  months ago. Game is no fun no more. Waste of a pre order for my series x. Apex  is more fun and it's free
1 map 1 specialist 2 helis 2 weapons 1 rework map  Zero Hour (Content)
They were still planning on adding to this game?? I haven’t played it in months, in fact I literally can’t remember when I played it last
Zero content
Not a good idea to launch your trailer a day before MW2 reveal
Please, the BF is the best FPS so don't ruin the game
When will people start realizing that us publicly saying that we are "keeping our expectations low" is not helping at all nor helping yourself? And that its even worse when you don't say anything at all but still keeping your expectations low? And that big game companies now, when they see us say that, we are basically giving them the greenlight to do whatever they want.   We need to actually start raising our standards/exceptions to a new norm, to a new degree to any games/new games. We need to actually start pressuring these big game companies into making games that are on par or surpass our high expectations and if they can't, then we don't take it.
This had better be incredible
Well lets hope the marketing team doesn’t get me like last time… or rather hope that the game matches the trailer
This game is not canceled?
I got zero hours on this game
Well this decides if my 120 bucks ar worth it
If this is good, it will probably save this game
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
7 months late LUL
Hype
It just doesn't make any sense that you have all of these people working on the game but deliver such little content after the game being out for months...
I can't wait to be underwhelmed.
Fk Ea Fk BF2042
just give us something to believe in just don't give us hopes and fairytales this time around please
I am seriously wondering and more than that waiting that if there will be any continuation of the battlefield 4 in this game. I mean is there will be a single player campaign in this game 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🙄🙄🙄🙄
lets see if this game can still be saved somehow
Lets goooooooo
Please Revive this game
If season 1 has only 2 new weapons + some from Portal. If season 1 has only 1 new map and 0 maps for Portal.  If season 1 has Santa Boris type skins and BP will have only cosmetics in it. The Game is Officially DEAD.
T.W.O NEW WEAPONS LMAO
Please be good
Dead Game
Generals Zero Hour ?
Forgot this game existed, glad I was fast in refunding my 120€ preorder T-T
Make it free to play
It's too late. We've moved on. One day I hope I'll be hyped for a battlefield game again, but not for a long while.
遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる遅すぎる
refund!!!
Season 1: Refund Option
They need to add more maps. One map ? This game is lacking in maps.
Bruh
Cant wait to be disappointed!
I can’t wait for them to show off absolutely nothing
I dont think it can get more dissapointing than it currently is. So heads up
give up EA and DICE!!!! im done, your broke my favorite saga, bye!
nobody cares you betrayed the fanbase
EA must be really happy they Privated dislikes
I hope Boats are coming to the new map as well as the leaked Panhard Crab.
High hopes for this games recovery 🤞🏾
Мне не понравилась Battlefield 2042.
I hope Boats are coming to the new map as well as the leaked Panhard Crab.
1 map, 1 specialist, and a battlepass full of lazy, generic cosmetics. Lol.
- 1 Specialist - 2 Helicopters - 2 Weapons - 1 Map  scam me once, shame on you scam me twice, shame on me
Unfortunately the game is dead before the release date. this is too bad for me and for all battlefield player.
No doubt the new specialist will be gender fluid so you can buy twice the skins for them whilst firing a rocket launcher that shoots glitter
Biggest comeback 💪👍 i hope.. anyway BF is my game
You know what they say: “when your at rock bottom the only way to go is up!”
Battlefield 4 will remain my favorite game of all time. I would love to see it get a face lift or atleast some optimization on consoles, you would make many Battlefield fans happy by doing just that alone
thanks for not refunding my season pass i was trying to refund a million times because I don’t play the game and don’t want to :) Best company ever
So glad I got this refunded.
Let’s gooo!!! I loved the game at first, then found out that there would be ZERO content for 6-8 months, then didn’t enjoy it
I can’t even play the game cause of my cpu
Dead game lol
Well if they could fix battlefront 2 let’s hope they can with this game too
2042 R.I.P
Give me the moneeeeey
👎😂
You need a trailer for 2 new guns 2 new vehicles and 1 new map ? Common guys..
Have ur expectations low and get excited if it’s good
Refund
Please just add Russia in bfV. I want Stalingrad map
No amount of convincing will make me believe that there will be a Season 2.
dead game. listen to your fanbase next time
this game is junk and trash... even good looks like was battlefield3 and battlefield1 so i dont pay for seson pass or whatever dice or ea want give to pay...
All i can say is i have hi hopes for this game bf2042  is a game for us to see new epic things  thats all :/
inb4 they try to market specialist again
just copy and paste bfv movement into the game add better maps and better destruction improve levolution needs alot more cover smaller maps i dont want to drive or fly across map every time
Just make a battlefield 3 remastered edition
I brought my brutal expectation and wait for season 1.        Selling bear in comment.
Refund
A dead game, a soulless product of meaningless corporate management... but with the emblem of the 79th AFU Brigade - Relevant!
There's so few people playing that a hype trailer for a game that launched incomplete and is perhaps now moderately better is a thing. No just no.
This first season better be free content. I did not buy half a game for the price of a tripple A title to pay another time for content that should be available in the first place.
Please cross play xbox série x and ps5 vs xbox one and ps4 for conquête 32vs32 or so for crossplay xbox série x vs ps5 no player pc this is really bad just cross play all console no computer!!!!  Big people stop playing this game because no crossplay just console!!!!
I predict that will change nothing
Let's Go !  Hype 🔥 🔥 🔥
Please I still have hope
The only zero hour I wanna see is command and conquer generals.
*C&C Generals Zero Hour* was a complete, finished and loved game. The same can't be said about Battlefield 2042.
WOW A DLC
Please for the love of everything be the thing that saves 2042, I really want to look back on this game they same way I do with BF4 and BF3
thier showing this the day b4 the mw2 reveal? well I guess it's better than the same day or after and absolutely nobody bothering to watch it
Glad to see they listened to our feedback and are adding even more specialists to the game...  Some cringey new character with a rocket launcher as a "special feature" won't save the game Dice. And neither will 3 new weapons one map and a new helicopter. The game is flawed from the ground up and the community has proven and shown that extensively. But I guess the EA executives don't want to gove up hope that one day we will accept the concept of Fortnite-type-skins in Battlefield games...
Don't return to this game. Do not let EA get away with what they have done.
Operation zero content and later this year season 2; operation zero players … 🙄
Dislike button here
ONE NEW MAP. Not good enough DICE.
Jfc dice making people wait again
There are 2k players left, there is space to go more down,
Games as dead as my grandpa
They still working on it? 😂I thought its dead
100% we will be getting new skins,recent maps with a few changes,new voice lines,maybe 1 new map,1 new gun,couple of new camos....absolutely everything we don't want 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Anyone still expecting this game to be good is beyond lost, don't buy this garbage, just go back and look at their scam gamplay trailer before release.  Also cross play with pc and console is just dumb
YEY! ONE MAP AND ANOTHER SPECIALIST NOBODY WANTS YEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please be good, please be good, please be good
NOBODY SPEND A DOLLAR ON THE SEASON PASS. THAT WAS THEIR GOAL ALL ALONG.  TO PUT OUT A POOR GAME AND STILL MAKE MONEY ON THE SEASON PASS.  BOYCOTT THIS GREED WITH OUR WALLETS
I’m anxiously hyped. 🤞🏻
What is it? Do you have hope? Will they climb out from Hell to reach legendary status? Does it still even matter….
It's a gameplay premier not a trailer so what you will see is wat has been recorded during gameplay. So what you see is what you get
is this another failure?
please dice, don't be bad ❤
Pure cash grab, absolute garbage 1 yr in.
6 months without the content. This better be good or this is all over
Game saved
God I hope I can download this game again! 😂
The season is called zero hour because we had zero content since launch.
My expectations are low. Very low.
why waste time on a dead game bring back devs on bf5 that would be better
zero hour stands for when player counts drops to zero
Comeback
This determines the games future, I don't expect much but I'm completely fine with it surpassing my expectations.  Does it look good? I'd say so, yea. Although we've seen how the trailer went originally so I'll need to see some gameplay first.
be the bfv
Can anyone fill me in...why was this game considered to be so bad? I'm actually curious.  The game looked great when it was released, but soon everyone was talking about how bad it was. What happened? Please tell me, I'd like to know.
Lets hope
Re-installed Bf2042 a few days ago after 4 months break. I hope, they fix the game and put in a lot of content. This game has so much potential!
Make bf2042 for free pls!!!! The game is dead!!
i miss this season because my pc is low spec. so i just first play in season 2 while i have new better pc & the best this is new stealth helicopter
This game doesn't deserve to come back from rock bottom, it was a spit in the face to all true fans of the series and shows just how little ea cares about anything other than our money. This game deserves to die.
Turning rock bottom into magma would be the only thing worse than what’s been done my friends.
This is going to be a beyond underwhelming dlc. It’s going to come out with 1 maybe 2 maps. I hope I’m proven wrong but I have no hope for this game
Is there a new update to the beta?
Dislike and next page
Sometimes I wonder how a fly can land on a ceiling when it’s still flying. Physically it should just fly straight to the ground. But I don’t know. I also think that crabs are thinking that fishes are flying.
I have a feeling that they will still screw this up…
1 MAP GUYS ONE NEW MAP AFTER HALF A YEAR LETSSSSSS GOOOO ROCK BOTTOM EXPECTATION LETSSS GOOO
I just hope that this season will bring changes that make the game actually BETTER than at launch
I wonder how many dislikes it already has
楽しみ
Can't wait to see.
Don't be sad, this is just how it works out sometimes
If this is good I'll keep playing 2042 🙏😁
At this point, I’m just expecting disappointment
Puede ser que con esto logré llegar a algo como No man's sky, o que termine peor que Nukem Forever
这阴间BGM我真的是蚌埠住了
We don’t need a trailer. We need actual content
Season One: ZERO CONTENT
6 months for ONE MAP and TWO NEW WEAPONS LMAOOOOOO
Last chance DICE
Zzzzzzz
I can already tell it's going to be a train wreck. But let's see if I'm wrong. I'm happy to be wrong tbh
Alright 8 months in and we're finally getting a season 1 announcement.
Can’t wait to get hyped and let downed again
can you imagine if youtube still showed dislikes
I hope to look back at this game in the future and say this was one of the best games of that time
Exodus mode was a step in the right direction, hope season 1 will bring something good too
Please be good ❤️
Haven't played this game in months due to lack of content lets see if this can grab my interest
apexが自滅した今、巻き返しのチャンスだぞ
- 1 Specialist - 2 Helicopters - 2 Weapons - 1 Map   embarassing
please be good
The time has come. Give the game for free. Zero hour is upon us.   Even tho, I hope the game isn't as bad as it was at launch.
This is either gonna be a saving grace for the game or it’s somehow gonna sink even more
When there's more comments then concurrent BF2042 players.
Yo the leaks shows that its only 2 weapons 💀💀💀
Trash
Zero Hour? Really? Your stealing names from indie devs now?
its a good game
Can’t believe it took them this long
Reminder that they killed Battlefront 2 for this
This won't change anything.
Definitely a big coincidence to release the first season trailer just one day before MW 2 trailer Anyway for the 1000 BF 2042 players , hope you have some good time after this
I won’t hold my breath
They probably spent the entire budget for season 1 on the trailer, and thats it
And where is server browser???
To those goblins saying that it’s going to be bad before even seeing the trailer, return to the cave.
Hope for some real changes and updates
Dead game
Якщо це буде хуйня з під коня, то я їбав ваші роти
This is gonna be the start of the redemption arc!!!!
Please don’t be trash, please don’t be cringe.
I think we've seen plenty of trailers before.the attic is also full of it.this will be the last chance for the fans, if that doesn't work I think every dice worker should sign up for a marvel trailer.
No way 😂 Even Star Wars Battlefront II had better release.
👎
Trangender specialist lets gooooo!!!
Alright fellas, who's ready for disappointment?
trash game
Refund
This game is dead and will stay dead, why are they doing anything with this?
refund plz
Ждём! Верим! Надеемся! 🤞🤞🤞
"ZERO EFFORT"
wish i could see the dislike count
Imagine in the trailer, a big text saying: "CLASS SYSTEM RETURN, NO MORE SPECIALISTS!"    Then right after, "ALL MAPS REWORKED, DESTRUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"   "SERVER BROWSER, CLAN SYSTEM, RANK"  all of it in a new and reforged "BATTLELOG!"
Anyone else uninstall the game back in January
It will pop off for sure 🧡
I wouldn’t even bother account admin(s)
So they finally  releasing the game now 😂😂😂
This game is still alive lol?
УРА!!!!!!
I actually like specialists!
I hope this turns to be the newest 'most disliked' video of YouTube.
Nothing in this will convince me to play unless specialists are gone.
Dice show us what you can do.  I'm nothing to you but I still have faith.
Wow it takes you as long as the GTA 5 loading screens to make any new content! I'm gonna go play bc, bc2, 4, hardline and 5
Why fix the game when you can announce a battle pass...
Can't wait to see this trailer It has been so many months since this game came out with too many bugs and too many problems including the player camp decreasing Let's just hope this one brings back players
No sé a mi me gustó el juego :v
Needs to be big, massively upset that we’re only getting one new map though. This season is literally make or break to claw back the players
JUST RIP THE GADGETS OF SPECIALISTS KEEP PUT THERE GADGETS IN THE CLASSES AND MAKE THEM AS PLAYABLE SKINS LIKE BF V I DON'T CARE F**K YOU I DON'T COME BACK I'M GOING TO PLAY MOBILE WHO UNDERSTAND BATTLEFIELD BETTER THAN YOU SHAME ON YOU DICE
Please don't be bad please please please p
Just drop the update and that's it, you're already late 🤔
lesgoo
I wish I could see the dislikes
It is already dead, stop mocking it :'(
Lol
So whens battlefield 10?
Let's go
This trailer is gonna be awesome. Doesn’t matter if the content will be bad or not lol.
HYPE
We pray this is the bounce back the game needs, please Dice 🙏❤️
Get better able to play bf3 on PS5……
🤞
아직 살아있냐?
Похоронили игру, суки...
Sargento Recker en Batlefield 2042
You know they rolling the dice 🎲 bro
It took them 7 months to make SEASON 1 dlc pass what a joke this game fail big time and even if this dlc comes out is not going to make a difference
I hope it improves this game, it hurts Leave Battlefront 2 for a poorly done game 😔
They rly made an update named after how much I would play it
Let's go Batlefield 👌
Today? TodAy iM pRoUd!
it's called zero hour, because there will soon be zero players left
Que salga todo bien 🙂
A news about removing specialists?
As Henderson said, here it is…. Hope it’s good this time….
Please add more vehicules et stop nerf this ! Its bot too late for bf 2042, take similar to bf4
Hilarious that they put time and effort into another trailer to try and hype us up...
Couldn't care less. Dead game.
Wow wow
Season 1: Zero Effort
Эх, щас бы поиграть в мертворожденный мусор, за который я отдал 5499₽ И спустя три месяца после релиза не смог играть из-за того, что они НИЧЕГО не починили.
More like zero players
You can only go up from rock bottom, hopefully this does something to the game
Please don't suck.
Batlefield 👌😎
Please 🙏🏻
2042 season 1 is named zero hour, this is a direct reference how long does it takes to develop this game
i really hope this is a solid season cause I think this game has a ton of potential
Let's see if we still want the refund or not
Failed franchise
Man I hope you guys save this game. It still has potential
1 map in 8 months you gotta be kidding 💀😂
The amount of hopium in here is insane. Let this pathetic cash grab die
🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼 for rework
Battlefield 1 Maps ✨🙌
These zero hours joke are like half of the comments
Im not getting my hopes up
This game is going to get torn apart on the 8th
Please get rid of the cringe voices
It’s happening guys, reality is repeating again. This is when battlefield will shine. I mean it won’t be such fun as BF4 for example but it will definitely be a better game!
This is like the first aid to heal battlefield 2042
I BOUGHT A GOLD EDITION SO PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD PLEASE BE GOOD
BTF 3 REMAKE PLEASE!!!!
Please dont mess the settings up again... would be the 4th time after an update
racha de puntos agregue
Yesssss!!!!!!!!!!, finally
まだ生きてたのかこのゲーム
zero hours are the same hours that I have been dedicating to the game for months
Y’all talking about some “please be good”..y’all do know it’s only one measly map right?
Selfish thieves and liars
Oh really
BATTLEFIELD WILL FIX WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WRONG,I DONT DOUBT IT.
Zero Hour is pretty much my playtime summed up
Use me as a dislike button for future option
By what I heard season 1 ain’t good and neither is season 2. Itll just have stuff that should have been in this game on release. Let’s hope season 1 isn’t stale. Please be a good season. Because who know who’ll still be here by season 2.
I'm scared
This is not Battlefield, shame on you
Revive Medal of Honor
Zero hype
Is this game still garbage?
Ah finally! Lots of hopes for this first season
I don't think anybody cares anymore
not going to spend a penny after the tragic launch.. waiting for reviews!!
Im so hyped! Hopefully this will be the first major step in bringing this game to greatness
Come on man, you have one of the best fps community, you can do it for us
Lmao nobody cares
Hyped but weary. Game feels great, fun, and stable after the patches, adjusting the voice lines of the specialist to fit the tone, reworking the current maps, and adding on to the foundation created would make the game be amazing. Although, seems to be following in other Battlefields classic history, broken at launch, polished gold by the end.
Battlefield fell off, bring back battlefield bad company 3
Battlefield will climb out of the grave
dead game
Lets go
They are going to get kicked by MWII mark my words
Only took almost a whole year
Bf team waiting over here! ⚡️
bruh
Zero hour. such a fitting name because it's how many hours I wish I put into this game
Since you're adding 1 map please put as many new guns in the game as possible so we have plenty of content to test. Limit the grapple gun to 5 uses to promote specialist diversity.
Zero hourS for make a Bf game lol
Finally my good vibes are back
Zero Hour, exact the amount of time im gonna spend for this game
i am praying to the Battlefield Gods that this won’t disappoint
やっと新たな情報… 待ちくたびれたよ😌
Ahahahahahhahahahahahah
Calling it now, this is just gonna be a paltry amount of content to appease the people who preordered the season pass, once its up, all major work on the game will be dropped so the team can focus on releasing the next broken, unfinished battlefield game.
8 months later...
Don't be sad, this is just how it works out sometimes
LETS GO
Please make Battlefield Great Again🙏🙏
🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏
Called "Zero Hour" because everyone has zero hours put into this game
Dead game, please don’t buy into the “Oh WoW CoOL TrAILER” hype. Let this game rot, 🚮 next please
Please Battlefield, You can do it!!!
That means temproyal was right. And that means ONE map. Oh man.. here we go.
The positive part (for me) about this first Season is that i have extremely low hopes.
Lol
Legit there is a tactical shooter game on steam called "Zero Hour". Jackfrags played it too.  Things are getting weird.
"Zero hour" because thats how much time was put into this game lmao
Dead game BF1 and V where better
Zero content
Pls be good
i only need bf3 in ps5
I want the game to succeed but only a miracle could make it great. Please be good.
Lmao I forgot about this game
why yellow tho 😐
Battlefield 2042 is definitely one of the games of all time
I don't want to have spent money for nothing
This is making me excited for MWII more
"Zero Hour" is how long they spent making BF2042
제발제발 갓겜까지도 안 바란다 할 만한 수준의 게임만 되라...
I still believe in this game
Played yesterday BF3...Wow this game was insane so good. And now i look this i haven't any words anymore how bad is 2042. You can bring so many updates what u want but this game will never be good.  Stop working on 2042 and work for another BF like BF3/4. Bring Premium back, Battlelog, Classes and many weapons like BF4  2042 is dead. Its not a BF. Hero shooter garbage
WORST BF EVER CREATED !
S E V E N  M O N T H S  A F T E R  L A U N C H
Just play Battlefield 4 it's still good.
4:00pm I’m gonna be rushing home as fast as I can to see this lol
Zero player.
I am praying I never lost faith in this game DO NOT DISAPPOINT
Ooh ooh ahh ohh ahh ahh! (Monkey noises) Content
wow  2042 is actually a game
If you guys fumble this, it's over
Im not hyped, I'll try season 1 but I don't want another disappointment.
Operation locker please dice !!!!!
This is do or die for this game. Best of luck to DICE
Best game ever! People still watching and playing it despite of big issues and small issues. What a game!!
Refund!
We have been waiting months it should be worth it please
'час расплаты',очень хорошо подходит
Holly Mother Theresa!
This livestream reminded me to unsub to your channel, thanks
No one cares anymore 🤣
C’mooon baby we need this rn, pls don’t just be 1 map and like 3 new guns, we need a crate of new guns and 3 new maps tops 🙏🏾 (and input delay to be fixed on old gen)
Zero hour..... 😅👌
Let's see how this recovery goes...
The actual release date has come
Battlefield 2042 is dead no one cares
Use this comment as a dislike button so we can show EA the disapproval of what they've done
Omegalul
Thank your this reminder. You reminded me to unsub from this challen because you killed BF...
좋아~! 웰컴!
Dead franchise
Let's go, give us some good vibes
Season 1: Zero Content
Hope is good
Lord give them mercy
Oh i forgot i was subscribed. Goodbye, trash game, trash devs.
No hope
I pray that this doesn't flop
Батлпасс серьёзно? Старт уже проигран, багов тьма тьмущая. Ещё пытаются завлечь народ
Despite, the game is so worse, this teaser gets me hype again.
HMM, I wonder why YouTube got rid of dislikes HMM I wonder…
I really hope this game makes a comeback.
Dead game
Hoping this is good so I can get my money’s worth
I'll get the game if this is good, I HOPE.
Cant believe they named the season after the amount of playtime i have in this game!
Too little too late.. now p%ss off
Finally. Like lord I’ve been playing every now and then but 8 MONTHS for the the first season. I enjoy this game and I want to play it, but if we don’t get another season like 3 months after this one releases I’m done.
This is your last chance
dont care + mwII 8 june reveal
Stop getting your hopes up the fact this wasn't ready to go before the game came out is abysmal. We are not to far from a year this game has been out and it still is full of bugs and hasn't received a single bit of substantial content. This will not be diffrent.
It only took 8 months of them making minor updates to release even the slightest amount of content that people may want
Come on Battlefield give us a fantastic season 💪💪
Yessssssssss😘😍🤩🥳🎉🎉🎉🥰!!!!!
This game Is so good
I’M SO NERVOUS lol everyone cross your fingers and toes
You can't kill what's already dead
Zero hour, named as such because the word "Zero hour" is when an operation starts, and with this season the game may finally have a release content count, polish and thought behind it that would make it release ready.
Just buyed the ultimate edition ! Witch gives me 4 free battle passes sheeeeshh
This is it. This will decide the fate of Battlefield franchise
Zero Hour😂
Just like my favorite Fall Out Boy song...             Dead On Arrival
Please be good
I hope this means they're getting rid of the teal scheme🦍
LFG
Oh my god, this is a battlefield trailer during pride month? This game will finally bury itself if it follows the trends.
does anyone still have hope for this failure?
Very much interested! Hopefully this saves the game. If this season is bad the game is tanked. Here's to booking 8
WHAT THE F**K YOU CAN'T DO LIKE THIS OH MY GOD I'M SO EXCITED
🕯Please be good🕯 🕯Please be good🕯 🕯Please be good🕯
One can hope this will be good.            Major COPIUM though
Finally, content
I still wish 2042 has a campaign
Nice
