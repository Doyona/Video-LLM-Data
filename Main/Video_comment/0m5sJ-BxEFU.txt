Former Vice-President of European Parliament: Boycott Beijing Winter Olympics Edward McMillan-Scott, former Vice-President of the European Parliament (2004 – 2014), said he had learned of the CCP’s suppression of Falun Gong back in 2006. When visiting Beijing, he met with several Falun Gong practitioners including one who had been detained for his faith. This practitioner testified that he had seen the body of a practitioner who had died in custody. The body showed evidence of organs having been removed.   McMillan-Scott said that the abovementioned example suggests that the hideous crime was occurring and that more and more evidence, including the volumes provided by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC from the China Tribunal, and Sabi, indicates that the CCP’s forced organ harvesting is on the scale of genocide and the killing of Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs for their organs have become crimes against humanity.   McMillan-Scott hopes that the international community will boycott the 2022 winter Olympic Games in Beijing, which would help raise awareness of the CCP’s suppression of minorities and groups such as Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Falun Gong practitioners.
