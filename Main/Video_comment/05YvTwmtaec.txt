We play too slow and too sluggish
I watched the game a second time and Fred actually had a good game. I give him a 7.
I like Fred but he needs to be more strongly on the ball in the middle of the park though but good game overall big up Dave great save ggutd
De Gea is a game thrower..considering plast blunders..some horrendous reason why Mendy holds it down before Kepa. Similar blunders last two seasons from DDG.. Although CR7 and the hype may get better results from him.. My opinion,.former blunders makes DDG unpredictable..
If United gets the Momentum of winning next few games then they are sorted and no issues even if they lose or draw any of the matches with Liverpool City Chelsea or Spurs. May be the winning momentum help them beating one of them at least or all draw. United has to go through Oct-Nov very carefully, may be more defensive to maintain the points.
We won, it's been a day since the game, but still fumin with Atkinson.
there is a reason that somebody is managers and others are trolls
What an absolute shambles that was
All the clueless kids giving ole a 5
No one seem to talk about Harry Maguire's lacklustre and indecisive display. Varane keeps covering up his ass. Anyway, all thanks to DD. As for Ole, United's job is way too big for him. Zero tactical know-how, no urgency in play, improper positioning from players, poor marking system, wrong substitutions et al.  This isn't the kinda football pattern the fans wants to see every now and then. Enough is enough.
I gotta say this time Ole ABSOLUTELY got it right! Good on a you Norwegian pe teacher. I'd happily eat my words if this continues long term!
we need to move the ball quicker and attacking more than defending  we have a good quality players in attacking and they can provide a lot more just have faith in them  and the more important thing is  bench Fred please  put DVB or Matic instead and let them do the right job   so we hope to keep winning ❤️
Goldbridge is a sellout !! He’s the malcom glazier of watch alongs. Dosent ever go watch his own team
Total  BOLLOCKS just  wait until De geu FK up again
Ref = 0
Dave Saves he's The Bestttttt Don't Ever Question Him again haters......
Did anyone notice the juventus score ?  They said they don't  need CR7. Well, it's  now 4 games without a win in Serie A.  So much about their cockiness.
Honest opinion about Greenwood ?
AWB was great too
I ñvavjuhesgs,cU
Ole out he got lucky
Performance was so bad IMO.
So pleased for Jesse. And Ole today. They both needed that. Still don’t think Ole is the man to take us to this next level, but I’m happy to be proven wrong.
Are we forgetting the fact that Southampton also should have had another penalty when AWB fouled in the box?  No idea why that wasn't given
How tf did people rate AWB 6.7 in terms of their game for the full 90 AWB was the best he didn’t put a foot wrong and was great attacking and defending
David De Gea has always been an outstanding and world class player, during the bad seasons without trophies he was often our best player. Unfortunately since Lindelof started to play our defence started to be shaky and mediocre and that definitely affected De Gea as well. David playing now with Varane and Macguire shows  great class and will only get better.
Fred had a better game than pogba and mcT
A huge honner too Ddg your macnifisent performance what a way to shut all the doubters piehole congratulations once again.
Pogba is useless. Ronaldo is simply a diver.
Fred & Maguire were freakin horrible today. I don't even want to talk about Fred, try Donny in that position. MAguire was passing the ball to the crowd for a several times. shocking concentration .
I dont understand playing Fred anymore. We play him for balance in the team instead of playing VDB but he honestly does nothing. He dives in for challenges he is not going to win leaving defense open and he is not a good ball player. Even if you look at our  defenders they dont want to pass to fred because its gonna come back at them. He has been absolutely useless so far.
fred is trash, he needs to leave manu. he is way below par. every time i see him defending i would be having my heart in my mouth.... what on earth did he not get the ball, or why did he always slip at crucial moment!
We should rate the referee too. Zero for me.
Fucking sell Fred!
Player ratings seem to be on popularity rather than performance.
Moyes will regrate not to sign Lingard after that amazing contribution last season. And they signed many players more expensive and less capable than him!!
Rowan Atkinson is much better than Martin Atkinson. n made me happy for years. Martin? he tried hard to destroy ManUnited for years.
We have 4 home games before the international break, Man City have to play Chelsea and Liverpool away during this time. We can build momentum and take advantage of the rest dropping points.
David De Gea please save my relationship
Moyes outshone Ole. He saved ManU again
Having watched the game along with guys who are Stoke  Scouse   man  city and Port Vale fans  all who said Ronaldo is still world  class   well yes  he is
Mark you should be doing referee's rating more often !!
why diidnt you discuss on shaw hand ball?
change a better looking picture for ronaldo in the player rating XD
Martin Atkinson=Klopp stan
Any real football manager will see that Fred is really useless except for our own PE teacher he hasn't learn nothing
Pogba was in the wrong position all game which killed Shaw
They need a stronger looking away uniform. It’s too insipid looking. Give a strong looking uinform to a strong team.
Still Manutd lack charisma. Please do not fool yourself with narrow victory. Conte ------- Conte!
Brilliant game, but Ole needs to use Matic early and stop showing favoritism.
McGuire can’t lead the team, he’s so clumsy like a big wooden block, slow in deciding where he should pass the ball and when he pass, is always to a no man land.
With varanae and us up the field we could see a different mcfred like today we still saw mctominay a bit forward so if mctominay is forced to push forward will be positive
Ole is still no good and the midfield is terrible, United are never convincing
Please Ole start anyone in the double pivot besides Fred !! Please...the guy didn't play one good forward pass today in the entire game...
Maguire and Fred are a liability
This Stoke football is making me question why I torture myself to watch theses games.  I was looking forward to the Chelsea game and the AC Milan game, but after United's performance I couldn't do it. I couldn't sit and envy those teams playing proper football (not spurs), having proper identity and style of play and do basic things like playing with more urgency, passing quicker, supporting and making runs. It's honestly breaking my heart💔 Ole is ruining this talented squad and our club.
Rest Maguire and Fred....
Wan-Bissaka looked so comfortable going forward and was really good technically on the ball. He is getting much better.
Ole cannot coach this ManU team & sooner or later it will cost us big time
wan-bissaka has been quietly improving for a while now. he’s drastically better on the attack, and he hasn’t lost any of his defensive awareness
5.6 rating for Ole shows that lack of knowledge from your supporters. Unfortunate
Fred this yr PES defense and tackle rating gonna drop below 50! What a garbage performance this season so far!
DDG, club legend. Sit down haters.
Ref and VAR nearly screwed us over
DDG MOTM with 84% of the vote!
WOW gracias saludos desde pacuso
"there's nothing wrong with average"                My asian parents:
CR7 was pissed at that young boys loss bet you he had a good word with Jessie
I think what's promising with United is we have grinded out performances and not played particularly great as of yet , when the team does start playing well, it could be a promising season ahead !
McFred was awful today! Wow
Maguire is actually a shaky player but don’t get mentioned because he is English
I simply don’t agree! It was clear ball to hand as Shaw went in for  the tackle. His arm was already out-stretched. Definite 100% no penalty. The fouls on Ronaldo were far clearer penalties!
Don't pretend you wanted that Matic sub pal 😂   Good attempt to rescue your bad take... but come on, thats not what you meant when you said:   "Fred for Matic..."
Ohhh yes lads 💪😅.. Need luck like this.. Still world class save but if we are gonna challenge for league these kind of results will get the job done 👌💯 good win today lads 👏👍
Dont shout!
McTominay was gassed after an hour. I would of brought him off for Donny between the 60-70th minute mark.
Good
If Varane was a car he would be a Rolls Royce. He's gliding on the pitch and looks so elegant. Dear lord he was a good pickup
So happy for De Gea🤘
Fred was actually terrible. Lost the ball plenty, and was turned over so many times
To me, the first Ronaldo shout is the same as the pogba foul on Zouma.
When players are considered playing bad when playing average, that can only be a good thing
Ronaldo was an 8 man.. He was back further than our cdm at times, doing their job lol
PP didn’t play well Crowd was against him
Moyes is a muppet, the penalty rule need to fundamentally change and Ole is a dead man walking. Ole’s comment about the midfield shows he doesn’t understand their role. I’m officially count dooku. I’ve finally realised nothing will ever change and I’m joining the other side. Thanks Ole for turning our club around you’ve done a great job, but it’s time for one of the big boys to come in so we can go to the next level.
Am an ole out because of team selection
I don't hate Ole, but I highly doubt this team is going to win anything with him as the manager. When you keep trotting out Fred and McTominay who wouldn't start for any other premier League team especially a top six side you have to question what's happening at the top. Even when he has a good game as a manager the mistakes are still glaring
Varane spent a lot of his time covering for Fred and maguire.  Go back and watch it He is amazing.
yall aint ballers just haters, good ball matic to lingard, just like that mctominly pass to ronaldo everyone played there part, good subs
What happened to maguire this season
Not only is Ole ruinning Donnys career, now he is after Sancho. It's pitifully how he benching amazing players for his slack favorites.
The fact Ole wants to play Fred ahead of Matic and Donny shows he is not a good manager.
Top 4 Guaranteed
it feels like de gea was not bad last few years rather he had no morale but now with ronaldo and others i guess he is getting his morale back and is starting to believe
the team played good fast direct alot of movement.. cant hate on that fred performance with all the talk on ole, u can see the team as been working hard this week in training, maguire just need to stop hesitating in moving the ball quicker...no problem with the midfield today
The tempo in the second half nearly cost us, very slow taking to long on the ball, but cant knock de gea, cr7 or lingard today, fred played much better today , but the officials were disgusting
Ronaldo kept looking for penalties, and diving a little to much for the good of the team. However the last tackle was clear and obvious, what's even the point of VAR if you only going to review west Hams?
I think the reason we don’t dominate for long periods like our rivals is due to the lack of intensity and tempo. If we just did the right things more often, we look better.
The penalty rules are a joke this season. Got to love the FA lol
I can't see or understand what people see in Harry Maguire
Thankfully I always supported De Gea and felt Dean Henderson better than De Gea conversation was a bullshit....And Those Bruno Haters will feel that soon.🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ole did well, brave subs to bring on sancho and lingard to replace two players that have played well in previous games, which was one of the negatives from last season.
Have to trust ole now not to let henderson steal  david’s place undeservedly
I think the rule is that if Ronaldo goes down in the box , play on and ignore it
Only Mark says all the wrong things Ole has done and then when it comes to giving him a Mark he says I don't see wat Ole did wrong 🤣🤷🏿‍♂️ wat are you on about mate
Who was MOTM? C'mon Mark put your phone down and concentrate pal
You shouldn’t of had two penalties ffs.
Harry Maguire is crap
Four away matches played and Pogba hasn't turned up for any of them he gives nothing to the team if he wants to leave let him go
can we all pray fred improves, if not he better leave by January.
Did u really say that Maguire was good today? Wtf, are u smoking?
Ole thinking about making Phil Jones Uniteds new number 6  , i read in reports
It's clear to me that Ronaldo & Bruno won't get any penalties unless they were hit by a fucking missile launcher.
Your little sheep are toxic.
Aston Villa is a tough game, they're so quick
Why can't we try Mctominay and VBD in the middle?
Someone told me liverpool coutinho is better than bruno 😂😂😂
It would be quite relieving to see de gea lift the champions League. He's been so brilliant for us over the years.
Harry was weak today taking time then getting in trouble
This was the first game since Ronaldo joined that there were many chances created so good job by ole, it sucks that Ronaldo didnt have his shooting boots on today but i am sure that will change by next game. the problem at the moment seems to be the defence, united seem to concede from any team which is weird because they have very good back 5 players some of the best in their positions. Also Atkinson go retire and feed the regions in a park you prat
we've had alot of conners but nothing to show for it
Atkinson is a dickhead...but we won thanks to the don DeGea... Ref needs to give that payoff back now 😂😂
Slow, boring football, zero tactics, incompetent coaching, gullible fans. We celebrate the win and ignore our poor performance. These fans have very low standards.
Ole in! Needs a contract extension.
AWB best one on one defender in the league.  Just needs to work a bit on timing and corners and he will be fully World Class.
i ThiNk toDaY BRuNo N ToMiNaY PlAyEd ReAlLy GoOd
United did to start every game 1-0 down, it was only when they concede they remember to move the ball forward and quickly
Ole 5.6 because he started Mcfred - double pivot against Westham without their best player is to cautious
As long as Fred is a key man in Oles team we will never control the midfield
Stop pretending that a penalty save is much more than luck
Up the tempo Up the tempo  Up the tempo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Play Pogba in a two with either Matic or Mctominay
It is against Liverpool, City and chelsea that you all will understand the rare importance of McFred......To beat Lukaku,s team, those Kop and our noisy neigbours our best chance is to use the physicality of fred and ceazy mobility of McT
The real player ratings start at 15  mins
Just think how good they would be without Fred
Fred shouldn’t be playing, as soon as matic came on the tempo picks up as well
Fam as much as we want Donny it’s not happening!
A well deserved win  , good play all around . The game plan by Ole was on par today and substitutions was good . Not a 100 percent convinced as yet about this team but not until we have played a top four team , a little humor by some commentators about who should or was going to take the penalty kicks for Manu  , lol . We shall see now about the rebound for champions league .
Sorry Hendo but DDG is back to his best in the world mojo. Only Neuer and Oblak rival him.
The ref had no balls today to make a call. Had to rely on VAR to make the decisions  on them penalties.
Get In lads
Don’t know how the last penalty incident on Ronaldo wasn’t given, either by the ref or VAR. He slides in the box, wipes out Ronaldo and gets no where near the ball, stone wall penalty but they seemed to brush it off instantly, as if because United were winning they didn’t need it
We started playing so much better when Matic came on.
Can we add referee ratings as well in the show
Great result - justified given that we were playing 12 men
Mark Goldbridge aka Don Mancorleone going to smoke a big Fat Cigar tonight!!!!!!!!  Justice was served haha !!!
It’s amazing how different our midfield looks from that of Bayern, City, and Chelsea. Look at Kimmich’s goals recently!
There are still many players that are lacked winning mentality... even the Captain need to improve his winning mentality. Need to raise the tempo even when the opponent play ultra defensive. Agree, lots of work need to be done.
Mark... easy to see Fred is the reason why Ole is at 5.6
Lucky utd again
He didnt do motm?
Irrespective of today's performance OLE out
What  sanction would the referee get for the terrible mistakes he made on the field???players ,managers get sanctioned ,players get sanctioned ! why not referees???????????//
I'd like to a mcdonny midfield tbh
Maybe ole has pulled a stroke of genius here by keeping henderson on our books. DDG has upped his performances since. Similair situation to the shaw and telles one. Gotta give it him mark
Fred was terrible again. And Pogba wasn't much better.
VAR & Martin Atkinson was Man of the Match
Scott
But I still dont understand the fact Mark...that why Fred is playing?
David Degea the boss🔥❤️🥺
Mark is very bias with the player ratings no matter how badly the players perform he normal gives a good ratings n that's not fair..
We should play Matic from start. Play him for 60mins then bring Fred on for that extra energy. We could lead games more if we did this
The ref was absolutely shambles
Not a good performance...low tempo football...but thrilling ending...😭  I feel like mark watched a different game....🤣
MY NO.1 ❤❤
In todays game, if a defender sticks his leg out, and doesn't play the ball, and a striker falls over it, it's a penalty!!! In any game, at anytime in history, if a defender hacks down an attacker, and is nowhere near touching the ball, it's a penalty!!! Martin Atkinson, not your finest display today mate, by a country mile!!!
Matic has to get in the team ahead of fred, even with mctominay next to him is irrelevant. Like for like Matic is a better CDM than Fred
That last tackle on Ronaldo was a stonewall penalty. I don’t understand VAR anymore
Martin Atkinson was referring against us
Thank u jessey. mack, what is happening with man United players? This is really bad with all this qualities. I feel shame sometimes when I watch United playing Rubbish will all this qualities. Take a look of Chelsea and liverpool, they don't have the qualities we have. What is happening mack? The earlier the better, man u players need to make ole happy cuz I believe ole is trying his best to make fans happy, but my big problem is United players. There are so lazy mack, let's not put all the blame on ole, United players are do lazy from defense to midfielder are so lazy. Gosh, so disgusting.🙄🙄🙄
Fred's best games are when he doesn't play.
Crazy ending. Downside for me, Fred and McGuire drove me nuts
Finally glad the Henderson over De Gea rubbish is put to bed, never even a conversation
That was a match that shows how poor Fred is. 3/10 for me.
Sancho gonna be a big flop.
De Gea has saved us at least 6 points so far this season. 👏👏👏
If you watched the interview with Teuchel after the Tottenham - Chelsea game, then you hear how forceful a manager needs to be when dealing with unacceptable performances This is Solskjaer's weak point
mctominay passes have been good today
This always happens when we play teams that don’t bunker down.
Ole has no bloody reason now to replace degea with  hendo. Atkinson had a stinker of a game.
I can't wait to get  a new midfielder after pogba leaves at least then pogba will finally have been relieved from he's duties in our empty midfield
🙄🙄🙄🙄 Now, imagine Rice in ManU jersey. 🤯
Frankie DeJong would be a perfect midfielder for us I think. Probably could get him too with the state Barca are in
Is that not handball at the end by de gea? Hit his right hand
People you need to show some respect towards Ole.. This league is becoming competitive every day.. Players and managers makes mistake and they bounce back because they don't want to lose. so trust your manager and show him your full respect.. because We have a team now that is capable of winning everything. GGMU.. <3
Lingardinho and De Gea!!!
Lingard is meh! 😒
Why can't we sign josh kimmich
Still, the refereeing team in Leicester City game was perhaps the worst in history of premier league. 🤦‍♂️  What a disaster 🤦‍♂️ Leicester needs to sue even the committee that picked that crappy referees. 🤢🤮
I’m sorry Dean but your not that guy
Luck Shaw should know how to stretch hand inside the eighteen,he shouldn't have done that it's childish to do that,he should thank our goalkeeper for saving him from the fans backlash It's time Ole start to use Van da Beek,he's not been fair to him,i don't think Holland players will come to Man United because of the treatment on VDB.
Fred is not better than Matic. Not in a million years. Matic is slow and needs to speed up but Fred looks busy only because hes running into players and making rash tackles.
Ole’s decisions in subs and team selection was good even the double pivot. Love Mark but he’s surprised about Ole’s score because he’s out of touch and blinded by misplaced loyalty. Ole out.
Well said on the ref. he was terrible.
Lucky ole.. de gea saved him so happy and hug de gea😀😀
Let’s be honest, the referee was obviously biased against WestHam & missed a clear penalty for them. 🙄
CR is Raheem Sterling of ManU 🤦‍♂️ He deserved a yellow card at least for his repeated diving. 🤦‍♂️
sancho benched to play mcfred
Maguire is just overrated , it seemed like varane was playing alone on the centre back, try Lindelof please
Who is Craig? Why was the live chat wilding out over this Craig?
I’m so happy that the other signings we’ve made have allowed Varane to go under the radar 😂 guy is absolutely top class and levels above Lindelof, also looking very settled already! Up the Reds 🔴
At the time
Epic game!!!!
He doesn’t get the subs right, it’s the subs that he should MAKE, we are so slowwwwww I yawn every time I watch us, get these prats out saw ole on the touch line directing players with no one looking at him were kidding ourselves guys
How many crap games can Fred play before he gets subbed. He is playing absolutely terrible at the moment. He would even get subbed in a Norwich shirt right now. What is our standards. We struggle because we play these players instead of controlling play. Also the VAR panel must of been West Ham fans. Both fouls were questionable, but the Kurt Zouma one was a shocking decision. Then they give a ball to hand penalty. Has the rules change. I didn't get the memo
I know Fred isn't a world beater but I did wonder why he takes so much stick. Today I watched every touch and every movement, WOW absolutel diabolical how he consistently gets picked over and over is beyond me. Would be good to see McTomminay and Donny I think they would be suited better.
This match settles the DeGea v Henderson debate
Phil Jones cdm  lol
"Average is fine" 👀
VAR roubed United
Forgot to do man of the match!
Fred is failing us as a CDM, his tackling is poor..
What does Fred actually bring to this man Utd team, I’m waiting for all the Fred apologists?
i havent watched the whole show yet but honestly if ANYBODY believes those subs are good, then you are delusional.
The thing is De gea has performed like this even during his supposed bad couple of years… he just had more errors and the media over highlighting it
De’gea In
Clear plenty
Absolutely fantastic game but I gave low rating to Ole because he is still playing Fred there
Maguire out ole out
If Fred is allowed to be a Manchester United player, then I’m allowed to be the Queen of Great Britain 🇬🇧 👑
Don't get carried away Mark. West Ham was tired and just coming to terms with Thursday football. Pragmatic United will not win any trophies.
Still think center mid ropey
Still think center mid ropey
Totally agree that last one on Ronaldo was a cert of a penalty and the Luke Shaw hand ball wouldn't have happened joke var didn't even call the ref over don't understand it
This is last season all over again.  Individual brilliance will save us a few wins, but realistically we don't control games or look remotely threatening for 85% of the games.  Its boring, it's static, and there's more talent on the bench then on the pitch
De Gea - 8 Wan Bisaka - 8 Varane -8  Maguire - 7 Shaw - 7 Fred - 6 Mc Tominay - 7 Bruno - 7 Pogba -7  Greenwood - 8 Ronaldo - 8  Matic - 7 Lingard -7 Sancho - 6  Ole gets an 8 today.
Good win today but Fred and Maguire were a joke today and i bet Ole hasn't seen that.
Ole needs to go! I was shocked took that long to bring in matic
De Gea is the best and now it’s obvious again because he has a great CD pairing in front of him
Ole in.
Maguire has been bad for a lot of games. Lindelof has been better than maguire all season
Keane must be so sad rn
Good show mate. I love United and Ronaldo. It is still too early in the season. We have to stop criticising and give them a chance. I believe that United will have a good season and hope that Ole can manage these guys!
Why is OGS so defensive when most of our players are attack minded I think Fred and Maguire need to rest Donny and Baily in the cup game to see what they can offer
Finally figured it out, Man Uniteds problem is not about personnel in defence (so no matter the personnel we sign in defence we will continue to concede goals) the real issue is about control of the game, we can barely keep the ball for 5 minutes. We do not control the game the way Chelsea,  Liverpool and City do. We need to work on this and this starts with not losing possession easily and not making errant passes. Too many sloppy passes
Matic's problem is when we don't have the ball
The ref today has to be investigated, I dont like to moan about referees but today’s ref was borderline match fixing. What’s the point of having VAR when you can’t even give a stonewall penalty
Mr Atkinson is an absolute disgrace he should retire right now
McFred+Pogba on wing ....Ole doing it again. Going back to sure thing after bad result! Why not Matic from the start? Not even bothered anymore about VDB! Questionable referee would be to blame if it finished badly, but again 6 at the back...goals from individual brilliance.
Maguire almost lost us that game. Him and the ref. Fred is bad
The celebration from ron " don't worry im here" shows his classs such a fucking baller mate
Maguire was bad today slow and very bad passer
I'm just angry with ref
Respect to David  .. this guy helped United in last 7 years
I do not like McTominay at all but i think he was very good today
We win from a Matic assist and everyone forgets how bad Ole's substitutions are. Clearly the weakest part of his managerial ability.
It was us against the whole fuckin world today... Joke of a refree.. Karma served well
Mark, you talk a good game but good people prevailed today. Nurture talent, don't buy it and smash the rest.
It was not a good performance. We will be in trouble this year. 4th is the highest we can get with ole
Love Mark but I hate when he's on his phone. Like wtf bro 🤷🏾‍♂️
Mediocre performance.... Great win 👏👏👏👏
I definitely can't hear Mark on the speaker. He just kept swearing like there's no tomorrow 😂😂😂
The fact that Fred bamboozeled his way to a United starting eleven just goes to show you Miracles are real!
Just hard to watch fred play, always losing the ball, can’t win a tackle, always being bullied, can’t make a good forward pass, Jesus Christ!!!  And Harry needs to start bullying these forwards and wingers, drive some fear in them….they just take him on like he’s not even there
Today's game aside... There are warning signs of frozen out players... If there come a time of replacing key areas especially in the midfield, we might found wanting.
Leaving McFred on as long as he did got Ole a 5 for me
Hate seeing the Munichs happy
What happened with Craig btw
Ole got away with individual brilliance saving him again. We need a style of play and to start moving the ball faster. Fred shouldn't get in the team hes useless. Vdb needs game time. Pogba has looked poor in last few games.
Imagine winning the games from the back again!  Mcfred is what we never wanted
Ole out.
So why hasn't anyone taken into consideration that west ham should have had a pen long before us?
Giving Ole 7 will make me never trust your analysis again, Mark. You are a fucking prat!!!
I dont know if its just me, but i thought mctominay played really well. a bit tired in the 2nd half but 1st half, whenever he got the ball, he was passing it forward
The hand ball rule is so asinine. Whenever you lunge in your arm will go with your leg for balance. Using your arms for balance is a "natural" position.
Any player in midfield apart from Fred, he said he was still learning to pass 🤦🏻‍♂️
This was a very good result but the performance again wasn't convincing at all. We are still individual brilliance FC. It's all happy days now but there will be an important game where no individual brilliance will come and we will crumble. You can't win a title like this. There is still no philosophy. That needs to improve.
Ole subs are literally the definition of 'All Or Nothing'
Dea Gea save ole ass today..
How bad must Donny be in training for Fred to play every game and consistently play with so many mistakes. He seems to get a free pass to play every game no matter how bad he is. Can't believe we must get used to mcfred again this season.
You really do talk nonsese fella.... McTomonay has easily been atop performer this year... Whereas Fred is a fu**ing lost cause.   Please don't lump the two of them together...  P.S McTomonay plays slide rule Passes as well as Matic.....
Yes I’m happy we won but overall football is dead. Ole still needs to go! We wasted that 2nd half playing side to side football! No high tempo or any tenancy to get more goals! And allowed West Ham to be in the game. This 3rd away games now where united have been poor! Ref was a joke also!
I like how the Glaser's got the GOAT (Tom Brady) for the Bucs and won the SB. Then got the GOAT for Man Utd.
Hopefully Keano changes his opinion about De Gea 😂
How many times he make utd lost the game.
Martin Atkinson is the worst referee in epl...
Wan bissaka did good, id say a 7. 8 is a little high imo
Can the players Average Match Rating be included after their names?
An awesome team winning despite the ineptitude of Ole
Fred is a number 4😂
Thats his job , save goals .   Keano will say .
How stupid! Moyes looks😂 brings on noble jus for the pen! Only to be stopped by Dave! Saves!
Sir Alex called Atkinson a cheat years ago. And he was right by the looks of it
The way I see it if its a foul outside the box it should be foul insinde the box
It's 3points I know but utd needs to play much better.. They need to move the ball quicker along with creating more.. Defence needs to improve..
Wan-Bassaki played like a don today.
Ole showed his balls today lads he went for it
Fred gets easily bullied and loses two many balls in vital transitions of the game. Forget forward passing, covering second balls and tackling I am not even expecting it from him but goddamn when he loses the ball on the box in transition that's just it.  He is playing every game, doesn't even get sub before Pogba wtf he has on Ole. Give VDB-McTominay or Matic chance that's only hope for the season. Fred can't even pass to save his life right now.
Let's not forget DDG (other than Jones and Ronaldo) is the only member of this team who has won the PL.
Absolute joke referring. Ronaldo absolutely should have at least one penalty. Var should have absolutely had referee check monitor. 2nd penalty call was definitely a penalty.
We all knew Henderson is no where near De Gea but it is all the hype of the English media that were trying to paint a bad picture one of the world’s best goalkeepers. Henderson is a good goalkeeper but not even close to Dea Gea. The addition of Verane will help him show case his talent. He was defending and saving at the same time but now the defense is good DEA Gea will be back to his best
Ole still needs to learn and stop being so stubborn. He is clueless
Mark= this is a community...... Anyone that disagrees with him = what you talking about!!!!!!!
My keeper
refballed so hard and still won
Only issue we got now , is the coaching seriously poor guys .

Reminds me off the old united,the only thing I wanted to see more Donny
United won’t be worrying any of the big teams this season
West Ham hadn't lost since early may, 15 games. Not even City, Liverpool or Chelsea can display that set of  data. This is facts. Not opinion. How ever you win against a team like that, it's an achievement.
Ole out plzzzzzzzzz iam 98 years old plzz get out
Still world 🌎 class de gea
idk what the manager see in FRED...i'm sure everyone feels the same
Trouble is Matic and mctominay as midfield paring = a distinct lack of pace , main reason Fred plays is because he’s our only midfielder with any pace
I would like to see DVB playing even if in another team because I think he's talent don't deserve to be on bench and I think Ole is continuing to fight to make DVB becomes a flop
Ref tried everything to Rob us today some of the decisions liverpool have got away with the last few games is crazy can see us getting robbed alot more like we did last season ever since klopp made them comments
Varane was immense. Calm, collected - some great bits of defending and good on the ball.
A referee in the Premier League being incompetent? In other news, water is wet, the sky is blue and every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.
Ok, don’t hate me, it’s a good win….but let’s not pretend like Matic coming on was a stroke of brilliance by Ole. You don’t come on in 87 min as part of some super plan. He came on to see the game off defensively as a draw, as we’ve seen so many times from Ole now. We’ve just got lucky…..again.
Marks raitings are reflected on if we win and not how the players actually won.....does wan bisaka get 8 if noble scores pen, prob not.
Last week you was critising Ole for putting Lingard on......hopefully today give you wisdom to not over react
The amount of hate you showed lingard is so sickening
Though we won but we shouldn't struggle alot if Ole does things right but I think he just want to prove a point. Mc and DVB come fast.
Ref was shite
since Klopp complaint about Man Utd got many penalties last season.. we rarely got one... Klopp a Prat!!!
I feel sorry 4 vdb...I wish pogba leave our club
Maguire was awful…
We started well, unlucky to be behind  but 2nd half no creativity lack of ideas , Maguire looked knackered as always. Couldn't see us scoring then Lingard took his chance
United way is speed counter...wtf is pogba doing at starting lineup
Yeah...keep on hating on Fred...
Fred should've been subbed off earlier.He was an absolute mess today
VAR: It's only fair we sided with West Ham because Utd already has VARane 🤡🤡🤡
Pogba assist over....cant assist ronaldo..bruno best...lingard 4 contract
With Fred n mc..back...pogba must b benched
Absolutely buzzing with that. I actually thought we played well to. If only we had a reliable cdm.
Matic is absolute class, how he doesn’t start ahead of Fred is a farce
*Mark undermining every thing Solskjaer does for three years straight. Ridicules him with a sarcastic impression and goes ‘individual brilliance’ after every win and ‘that’s on ole’ after every loss* Also Mark:  *How are all these followers giving Ole a five!*  SMH
I am slightly disappointed with refree today Ronaldo should have at least one penalty this afternoon
We must be better, but to not win that game at the end, considering we should have had a pen just before the West ham pen, would be a disgrace. VAR must be looked at, what a shame..........BUT YESSSSS UNITED LETS GO 😁😁😁😁
Great save by de gea.  Well done that man
I am waiting for the new video game,Ole in,Ole out,Ole out,Ole in,Ole out,Ole in again.
De gea got stick when he was making mistakes
Ole's substitutions are based on luck. Sometimes he got it and sometimes he didn't. Is that consistency of a tactician?
Imagine Solskjaer swapped in a player just to take the penalty and he missed the penalty. The Oleout brigade would be running their mouths.
Do one, ref. All west ham fans are off crying to their mummas rn
When liverpool lost the cl final to real and came havent won the pl, you said we had to win titles for our players to be called world class. This doesnt apply to man u i suppose.
We Give Ole Less Than Mark,,,,,, Then His Reaction Is What Are You Talking About???? Again His Opinion Is Is Alone,,,?
De gea never left the No.1 never in question
Fair play that ref should go out of football
We should be winning this game easily even without getting any penalty decision. To see us struggle to break down smaller teams time after time is very annoying... Ole only plays counter attacking football well. Someone like Zidane is badly needed.
Watched the game..so boring of utd play..west ham were better and more exciting to watch. What is going on? Why can’t the coaches coach these players to play better? Sure we win..lucky, really. How would they fare against the likes of City, Liverpool, Chealsea with a more expansive football. Gone are the days when it was always exciting watching utd play even when they lose. Put VDB as he can lighten up the play with some intelligent and exciting play. He cannot just be warming up the bench..he is too good for that.
Ole got only 5 , people with agendas on this channel.
Imagine watching that performance and thinking we can compete with Liverpool City and Chelsea. Ole is trash
Still ole out
I'm sick off watching united playing with Fred even the United players won't pass to him .One off the best number 6 players we have ever had Michael Carrick his he blind Fred is useless can't pass ,we will never win nothing with Fred and his marking off players is awful he just wondered around like a lossed sheep .Ole says this is the United way no way near as Sir Alex wouldn't have Fred cleaning boots ffs
DDG has and will be our No.1 period.
I thought bringing on Matic in the second half was brilliant.  The guy can’t last all game, and has lost pace.  But in the dying stages of the game when everyone is tired, he really shines.
Thank god West Ham was without Antonio though... they would have won with him.
Ole was horrible... We had Pogba, Bruno, greenwood, Ronaldo, Sancho, Lingard, Martial, van de Beek at our disposal and we had to wait till the last minute and rely on a De Gea penalty save to win against West Ham. Forget about winning the league or Champions league if you're happy with this kind of performance.
WESTVAR UNITED😂😂😂😂
FRED OUT
Thank you very much Degea and Lingard! That referee almost ruined our afternoon!
Fred need to go!!! What is wrong with this coach
Dave saves, even Jupiter can not save West ham
Without DDG where would Man Utd be these last 7 years
Shocking we didn't get a pen today
Sit down de gea’s hater and the English media He’s to back to his best my keeper ❤️🔥 Dave saves
Lingard be winning back our hearts
Who is Craig? And what happened?
I’m surprised Mark didn’t notice that he completely missed man of the match😂😂
Can someone explain to me who Craig is? The chat was going crazy about him.
The Utd way in 2021: keep it tight and win through a moment of brilliance
We won against referee, West ham and var..
De gea motm with lingard
What happened with Craig??
Fred will be the death of me
YESSSS
Craig went off 😂
Did fred loose center of gravity during summer break
First
