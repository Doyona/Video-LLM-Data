Now this is how you make a trailer (and film). Both are works of art.
This one right  here  I will  have  to  say  that  it  is  the best film ever made  in  the  twenty  first century  compared  to  a  whole  lot  of  other films coming out  all of them are computer  generated  type films now those  films are getting  a  little  bit  ridiculous
Yeah this film was incredible  I have already  seen  it  twice on television  and  it  blew  me  away
అమ్మ బాబోయ్ 😮
This has to be the worst horror movie i have seen this year. Its slow, boring and has zero sense to it, im glad i watched it on Disney+ and didnt waste money to see it in the cinema
Need part 2❤❤❤❤
Need part 2
this looks absolutely  fvcked up i want to watch it now
Why the Vikings song???
Wow omen is too bad
Wtf they using “Dark” series theme song
Vikings
What a stupid fukn movie
What a movie ! That's all I can say
I don't understand why male offspring is the main role, Margaret who gave birth to her I think also plays an important role as a successful offspring. Will there be a next scene where Damien meets Margaret and her siblings? I'm so obsessed with this storyline
This movie is so underrated😢
Love the trailer but not the song. The song was from Vikings and will forever be seared in my mind as the Vikings into
Worst movie I've seen in a while!😂
I fell asleep. It was boring and pretty dumb.
Spoiler alert, instead of Damien the child will be a girl.
0:24 itz just😱
Hollys congrats on yr cousins first hollywood film!! I bet shes AWESOME!!❤ I just have to see it!
For the best actress nominee  for sure.
Oh weawy 20th Century Fox.. we just wanna use the Viking’s intro song do we
Omg don't waste your time the movie was terrible😂
This movie is pretty much a scarier version of Immaculate. Certain things are just too alike, like the secret cult and infants… 👀
Boring movie
whats that played at the end? it was backwards? 🫢
Hope the film is better than the lousy music.
Damien is The Omen..End of.
There are so many red flags in Roman Catholic, yet there are still many members of this church…..  The main actor is superb! I hope there's a sequel.
just like the tagline "the most terrifying horror movie in this year" Nell Tiger Free number #1 fan since The Sevant
VALHALLA!!!!!!!
Less horror than expected
Can I watch this without watching the original ?
Omen as 90s movie I was thrilled and now this is pure nostalgia and perfection ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No 6 is twist... I enjoy omen movie💕💕💕 already❤❤❤now The first Omen of this movie💕💕💕 based the same💕💕💕💕💕 something different🌸🌺🌻🌹🌷🌼💐 i see this trailer💕💕💕💕 waiting iam❤❤❤❤
Why they made boring movie.. Nd want us to be excited for sequel... But I m excited for sequel 😅
Sepertinya akan ada lanjutannya. 666 ada 4. Trus katanya ibu Damien adalah serigala tp disini berbeda
Of course they had to wokeify the omen. Take out most if not all, male leads and put more females in. Thank you, fers!
Solid solid horror movie! If you're a horror fan and enjoyed emily rose, the exorcist, st maud, blackcoat's daughter and the A24 horror trifecta (midsommar, hereditary, talk to me) - you'll enjoy this one. It gripped me and did not wanna make me open multiple tabs on my browser!
Zombie first land it’s a scary movie from 20th century Columbia.
it was okay. the end is a bit satisfactory then the beginning.
Stupid content. Not even close to its purpose, total failure.
Worst movie ever.. Poor screenplay
This movie is sooo gooooddd ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Okayish but still a waste of time 😅
Bro the same movies droved on the 16th called immaculate how original
Ragnar Lothbrok
Vikings theme song is pretty cool lol

This is such a cool trailer! Best one I've seen in a long time.
Sooooo, many people be saying things about "original" film or reboot of something. Should I watch those first before watching this? I am so into horror movies but mainly Japanese and Korean ones. Never really into anything nun related. Please the guidance! Thanks+
Just watched this yesterday, it is better than the original Omen. I have never heard of the director before, but she  is definitely good at what she does. Very good performances from most, including the lead. Excellent sound design.
Nothing spectacular. I've seen better and I've seen much worse.
Has anyone watched the movie yet ⁉️ please let me know . And PLEASE DONT LIE 🤥
“You weren’t supposed to survive, none of you were”......plz bring me the sequel to it ❤
👎
This was much better than I thought it would be.     It actually did creep me out!      I grew up with the OG trilogy and this prequel has inspired me to watch them all again.
Set in 1971 but in the disco they are dancing to a song called Daddy Cool by Boney M.  Which wasn't recorded or released until 1976.
What exactly happened in the mid 70's that made them come out with such dreadful movies. No wonder they made those commercials "it's 10pm do you know where your children are?" 😂Yeah, at a friends house watching movies they shouldn't. I am 58, but the minds of writers back then wow. No movie these days keeps me thinking about it, the last one for me was Constantine regarding religious types of horror.
worst trailer ever
Vikings!
Crazyyyyy great movies
Youtube video backmasking reveals the evil hidden within.

Fully same as that of immaculate and a total waste of time
Is no one in this Generation capable of making something original anymore??? this is complete waste of time.
Omg, đoạn nhạc trong video này là từ Seri Vikings 2013 😂😂❤
Did you know that in the past omen movies the cast of those movies had accident or died after the movie was finish, I notice that when people do movies about the Devil tragedy happens. But cool movie by the way can't wait to watch it.
Wait a minute... Vikings
Kehanet e inanıyorsanız eğer, ve ben deccal isem, tek isteğim; ishtar currie Wilson ile Japonya hirosima da yaşayıp bir aile kurmak; armageddon a kadar.
Once in a while  I  go see these films and i watch it and i like them too my wife  on the other hand she mostly Ikeda  romance  or comedy  films  but me i mostly like jim carrey  movies me and him have known  each  other  for  a long time and we ard still friends  to  this  day
I took my son to go see this one he loved  it  he did not get scared at all he sure is brave to see something  like  this  not one time does he ever have a nightmare   he enjoys these type of films
It's the vikings into song smh
whys it using a theme from Vikings lol. weak! so lazy
Best trailer that is suitable for this film 👌🏿.
Trash waste of time
how are christians ok portraying the essense of their religion with lesbisanism and other twisted stuff... this is just wrong on too many levels
This was a good movie
dislike for how terrible this trailer is.
I like your T-shirt! ;)
Рагнар Лотброк Викинги
They stole the opening music-song is from the VIKINGS DVD SET.
Sorry, I cant shake vikings from this song
Anybody feel batman vibes
Bakwa
I'm not typically a horror movie- watcher but I went & saw this with a friend & I actually liked it! It was just the right amount of suspense but not too disturbing. The acting was great in this movie as well...the main girl is very good!
Why use Vikings theme song!
The story was terrible but the trailer made look suspenseful and exciting
A well made prequel 👍 with twists (although i worked them out pretty much straight away ) 😎.
Movie was mid
Vikings opening with some weird visionary
😱
0:33 She did the lightskin stare! 💀
When Ragnar said "I do not believe in the god's existence..." and invaded Rome, I literally cried !
Worst movie ever watched
I taught i was gonna see Ragnar popping lol.
i saw the movie and have a few things to ask about it so SPOILER ALERT....    i dont get the fact that she had to be led out to party and then forcedfully sacrificed for the ritual, when all along it was the same bad guys in the orphanage? i mean they couldve just dragged her into the ritual spot right? no need for luz to influence her into going to the club and paolo seducing her...idk just my perspective
I saw this moive,. three times. Storyline, actresses.. especially NELL TIGER FREE Apparently The first Omen will be Great & Best ever in horror movie.
Damien’s mother
I only went to see this movie because of the trailer and the tease of Fever Ray being part of the soundtrack...well, big disappointment
Useless trailer 😅
Saw it yesterday in theaters and absolutely loved it! Gorgeous cinematography, great sound design, and great acting.
What is the name of the song please?
First hour boring.....second hour really good.
Meh. Another somewhat decent supernatural horror. Very messy tho.
Go woke go broke...just like The new exorcist movie. Hollywood just doesn't learn 😂
Abe pura trailer dekhaa pooja ke kamareeeeeeeeee meeee 😂😂😂😂😂
This movie is horrible, i want my money and the two hours of my life that i lost watching this miserable mess of a movie.
I love fever ray, that's why I'm going to watch this film
Vikings themesong?
Saw it, very well done, terrifying and horrifying, but expect a bit of "retconning".  Also at 0:25 I just now noticed the candles and lanterns form a demonic fanged mouth and eyes that seem to be devouring the praying girl 👹
Just makes me think of Vikings with this soundtrack
I saw this movie today. It dragged on and on, and it kept switching the plot around. The story made no sense because it kept changing all the time. It was like three or four endings pasted on to the main story without explanation or resolution.
Let's see movie about muslims now. Christianity has been done 🤣 so much material.  Would it be comedy? Would it be horror? 🤣
Very nice movie horror without any ghost pure evil loved from India must watch.. I think it will have second part
THE OMEN IS -> ISREAL(666) {ECLIPSE = 666;} ISREAL(JAREDKushner);
Is this only in theaters ?🤷‍♂️
0:17
Song sounds like the black ghost song from twilight movie 🤔🤔
I've been obsessed with these films / books/ tv shows since the early 80s and can't wait to see this.
0:54 THE FIRST OMEN RATED R ONLY IN THEATERS APRIL 5
Many movies now focus on the lowest denominators: graphic violence and demonic themes. Have we forgotten how to be more creative and wholesome? Do we even try? We are on the wrong path America. Beware!! Judgement is coming and you should be very afraid!!!!
just saw this ON FILM 35 MM 🤯 and holy crap I yelped a number of times, great that they used FEVER RAY for this trailer because the film itself felt like a sick music video
I wanted to see it but now I don't know I'm a huge fan of the Omen 76 film was prime and 2006 remake was good
I was obssesed with this trailer so much that decided to watch the original (loved it) and today I went to watch this one and it was great! 🖤
This trailer is amazing!
Isn`t this the Vikings theme song?
Vikings intro song???
when a t  series that is as good as vikings use this as intro. it dosent make this trailer scary at al
Nice to see a movie live up to it's awesome trailer!!  This movie was great!!
Bro this  would succeed in comedy film lmao.
Most of the horror movies*  Trailer 🗿 Actual movie 🤡 Bt hopes this one to be better 🤞🏻
does anyone know the songs that played during the club scene
i just watched this movie in theaters AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE PLEASE GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW I CRIED FROM FEAR SO AMAZING
think this music was used in the opening for the Vikings tv show
VIKINGS THEME SONG WWWWW
This movie is just weird n freaky
Please someone tell me if the sound of this movie made you dizzy and sick
This is an absolute banger of a horror film
Church or something is for protecting from evil right then why it’s feel like it’s most haunted places cause of movie?
Why this got the Vikings theme tho? xd
Superb visuls
Weirdos
Bekar picture hai 👇🏻 Who agree
I liked it
DREADFUL.  Not a horror movie at all.  And not a good movie to boot.    Nothing more than a few - emphasis on FEW - retreads of the original.   And let’s get real - “Rosemary’s Baby” did birthing the devil so much better.   Save your money - wait ‘til it streams.
Oh nice an other movie about me :D
He is born of a Jackal Not a Human. It is not consistent with original story line. Fans will be disappointed !
Not scary at all, jus a warning about the Antichrist
what song is this?
trash
puj bre
Just saw The First Omen, won't spoil anything, but the lady about to give birth in the trailor has nothing to do with the movie.
Looks awful
Damien was born of a jackal. If this movie ignores that fact, it surrenders its claim of being a "prequel," and betrays itself as nothing more than a Hollywood con job attempting to ride the coattails of the classic 1976 film. Let's hope that's not the case!
Vikings
Nothing to fear in this life
they did a great job on tailer and trailer music 😂
Just saw The First Omen as it was released on the 4th of April in Australia and OMFG IT'S AWESOME!!!   Akasha has literally saved Horror as we know it  Yes there is a Jackal!!!
I'm excited because it's a series I love 👏 I'm looking forward to the connection with the first film!
The song perfectly fits the trailer 😈
Honestly, I did not mind seeing this like 20 times in theaters. I will be checking out this movie this weekend!
Why did they have to use the theme song from Vikings though....it was also used in The Following...I mean, it's a great song but overused and not a good fit here?
Remember guys, this is technically a Disney movie.
Can you please quit "remaking original content" do not butch a great series.
The original movies are my favourite horror/supernatural movies i hope this doesn’t disappoint, trailer has intrigued me….
not even a huge fan of the omen series but i’m going to see this opening night in my city exclusively because of the fever ray track on this trailer. “if i had a heart” has been begging to be used in a horror movie since it came out in 2009😢 the rest of their album is perfect and self titled.
The 1st 🥇 Omen (2024) is Rated R in red 🟥. ❤️
"The following preview has been approved" screen 📺 [Red]: The 1st 🥇 Omen (2024) - Rated R ❤️
What's with using the opening theme music for "Vikings" in this trailer?
Why not go with the original theme tune, instead of borrowing one from a whole different series? Or even the soundtrack from the 3rd Omen..
Wow it is interesting movie....Looking Forward for Raya AIDILFITRI 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰from 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Can somebody please find what this song is called please
What’s the song in the trailer
DUDE I AM SO PSYCHED FOR FRIDAY. I hope this is a genuinely good prequel. The Omen remake was pretty good, shot for shot pretty much, "ITS ALL FOR YOU DAMIEN" Is such a  legendary scene. I want good horror films to come back and not trash devised to steal teenagers money.
The music choice is excellent
The film actually  to me it does not look scary at all  it looks more like comedy  than  horror  the way  that they do films these days  it is all computer  generated  images now that looks ridiculous  man  why  do  they have to keep doing films that way it is out of  control  man  keep doing better films in the near future   when they do that I will pay for  them  to go see in theaters
My wifebi do know  that  for a fact she does not want to go see this one she is not a fan of these types of movies
Entire theater was vibrating lol
This is a Prequel film to the 1976 movie The Omen btw  Instead of a jackal , the AntiChrist male child will be born of a woman
whats the song?
Vikings music intro
Isn't that the song from Vikings intro?
People still don't know when to leave good enough alone. This film looks like it's going to do nothing but tarnish the legacy of Omen.
I love the music in this trailer it’s so ominous.
Is this set before the 1976 film?
How the little piggies will grunt when they hear how the old boar suffered…
I am in my fifties but the first Oman movie gives 😂nightmares when I watch, there is something about that movie.
Frick Bill Nighy is in this. Hope he brings his stage performance to this one too, watching it just for him.
Will this movie get  release in India
They try to be Vikings sooo bad, and failed miserably
that’s the Vikings intro 👀
My favourite part was where Ragnar came out and shouted "Who wants to be King!"
Oh boy... here we go again.
The song playing is "If I Had a Heart" by Fever Ray
"To control those who don't believe... create something to fear". That sums up religion perfectly.
meh
I am a big fan of the original horror franchise.  I was bitterly disappointed when they remade the Omen in 2006, I went to the movies to see it on the 6th of June 2006 (666) only to be disappointed, they had the opportunity to update and remake the franchise, but instead they simply remade the original movie, I was ready to leave the movies during the film as there was nothing new for me to see, but I enjoyed the cast and certain aspects of the movie... needless to say I haven't seen it again, which is sad as the Omen is a trilogy, and this movie died on the first try.  I am excited about this film, it looks so good, I hope they haven't made the same mistake as their predecessor.
Im generally okay with this film, just as long as they keep out any political stands. Yet, from looking at the director... It's probably going to be political.   Do you guys not like making long-haul money from one franchise? It's not hard. Just hire the right people and keep it real! God, this is getting old real quick!!
Looks stupid.  The original was great!
Can't possibly be good. Every reboot is a let down these days. Expectations real low. Will watch it on cable.
No way they made it that dark 😨
SATAN MORE HUMAN THAN ANGEL once fall never belive stop human church witch eat sin whos holly saint let game begin play with goatboy damien soul nun congurijing open on easter phill temptating damien thorn sen must seeee antynun  mom antyson hope be masterpiece
This is a kickass trailer
This honestly looks really good. I don’t know if it’s the music that’s making it seem like it’s good, but I think this could be one of the best horror movies since the conjuring and insidious.
This looks like a great movie
Woke. Feminista😢
Dont Put Vikings Theme song in this crap Leave our king and Brother Ragnar lodbrok Alone 🪓⚡️🇸🇪🍻🇵🇱🪓⚡️   🐺🐺🐺
Looks weird .
This is dumb - Damien's mother was a Jackal. There was no "first" or "before". The narrative was perfect in the original film - nothing will ever match it.
Hail Ragnar!!!!
Fever Ray is great.
I came here to see a trailer, not watch VIKINGS
What song is that? I remember it from twin peaks the return
Such a great trailer. I love the original trilogy. This looks to have the right vibe and I so hope it lives up to the trailer.
The catholic church is soooo evil, their teaching are not the LORDS!
Loved this trailer more than the one that told us more plot 🥲
FEVER RAY MENTIONED 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Antichrist  is finna walk the world foreal this is his introduction
Can't wait!
Margaret will be Damiens mothers mother the Jackal
The music is the opening song of vikings
What was in her mouth?
Why did the woke people. Destroyed  a classic
Is it connected to the nun or to any conjuring universe movie
Song?
Oh wow, another non-original idea...what a shock.
I like the sort of Viking music in this trailer
Vikings theme
I didn't know Princess myrcella became a Silent Sister
Wasn't Damien born out of a jackal?
fyi this is a r movie
We don't want a human element...We Want A Jackal😂😂😂
Meh, looks like another average horror movie. Will likely skip this.
Sounds like the intro to the show Vikings on History Channel.
They are taking all the past movie with males at the center, and just totalling pinkwashing them. More Hollywood mess. I would advise men to boycott these films.
Sonia Braga 😍
Put a chick in it and make it lame!!
Song?
This is the first trailer i have ever seen in reverse and boy is it awesome.
FEVER RAY MENTIONED RAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
Be afraid
Pretty good trailer I plan on checking it out
Well, that looks like it's going to be craptacular.
ti ees ot tiaw t'nac
Cool... They never really got into Damien's real Mom outside of what's seen at the cemetery, nor much about the time she spent at the hospital where she had the child, and what the followers did to the Thorn's own infant son when he was born there on the same day...Remember that the hospital burned to the ground not long after the elder Thorn's consent to the switch, with the fire conveniently starting in the records room...
Meh
What is Hollywood trying to tell us about women?🤔
😭Can y’all get this the heck off the ads I see bro I’m not tryin to watch like dang
Ok Vikings theme song
Why is Damian a girl? lol no thanks ill pass.
Father Brennan looks pretty badass in the trailer. As a Christian I'd be a little unsettled physically and spiritually to watch it but the trailer was well done and the visuals look incredible. The cinematography will probably be amazing. Also loved the music!
Couldn’t find a different song for the trailer than the one used for Vikings theme 😏
That's Ralph Ineson from Diablo 4! Can spot that voice from a mile away
Even since I was a kid, and saw The Omen when it first came out, I never understood the actual details of how Father Brennan witnessed the birth of Damien from a jackal. I mean, where was he at to witness this? Was he stationed at a hospital when an ambulance brought a pregnant jackal into the ER? I mean, the movie never explains this. The 2006 reboot never explained it. It looks like this one finally might!
Vikings theme music?
Leanne is that you???
Too bad they used the theme song from Vikings
Mandela Catalog>>>>>>>
u know, I would like to say, stale bread, can still  taste good, either way u slice it but at this point, with so many wilted, brittle, dry ideas, please don't bother to bring the butter when the penmanship dictates the taste of concrete Can the mother who bore Jason from Friday the 13th or Norman Bates be the next lemming off a cliff in line
The entire movie would contradict this. Not the unnecessary remake, the 1976 original. Want to know where the term Born of a Jackal gained more popularity from? Ask Damians' mother, Maria Scianna. A literal Jackal, who died giving birth to him.  Quit putting Rosemarys' Baby where it doesn't belong.
Unbelievable they are changing the lore everyone whose seen the Omen knows Damien’s Mother is a Jackal.
Whyyyyy are there so many Catholic/demon/exorcist movies out there? It’s wild. Maybe switch it up….get some charismatics involved or something if we’re gonna stay on this theme constantly.
There’s no way this will top the original. It’s a classic.
wil this be scarier than Exorcist    that just came out 6 months ago ?????
We go back to where it all began, before the prophecy, before Damien Thorn.
This is a highly demonic movie and people shouldn't watch this if they care about their salvation. There is a lot of symbolism in here. Yeshua the Almighty is returning soon and will judge every person according to their faith and works...Repent while there is still time.
Interesting trailer. One of my wacky theories could be that they are transforming people into becoming Satanists-people who worship Damien just like the nannies in the first one.
Give this property to A24
why are they using vikings op
Some things need to be left alone. No remakes, no prequels, no nothing. Leave the original as is. Some things don't need to be improved on.
Why vikinks?
I'm good easy pass they took a once beloved franchise and self inserted again
What moron thought using the theme for Vikings for the trailer was a good idea?
This is such a cool trailer, now I’m excited for it
Is this a remake or a prequel?
They have totally messed up the story of Damien's birth in this movie
Can someone tell me the name of the song?
OMG!! That is my favorite themed scary movie!! And , this song from Vikings!! I love  it!!! I cannot wait!!!
Why would they use the Vikings theme?
horrible trailer. let’s also let this franchise rest
If I had a heart - Fever Ray
Vikings Theme Song?!?!
😂You mfrs are funny with your buck sergeants pretending that they know something...😂
Miss my vikings 😢long live ragnar .
Ummmm........... 🤔............ Damien's birth mother is a *Jackal*.    Everyone knows this........... There better be a Major Plot Twist in store that coincides with what I just saw in the trailer,  Ofherwise.......... We will have words.
If I Had A Heart 🖤Fever Ray 🎶
Another lazy, unnecessary, trash  prequel leaching off a classic film, directed by someone wholly unequppied to helm a project of even half this size... nice choice on the Vikings theme lol
Ok but the VIKINGS theme??
Giving American Horror Story Season 2 vibes. I want to see this!
Well the nun2 and the new exorcist are smash hit so we my as well do the same for the omen.
Best accidental ad click ever.
Its all for you Damien!
I know it will not MATCH THE FIRST ONE GOOD LUCK!!
Can we take a second to appreciate fever ray??? Lots of other amazing songs too
so excited for this omen prequel. by far my favorite horror movie of all time. i’m assuming this is going to be about damien’s biological mother and i’m pumped!
The movie is almost 3 weeks away and WE ONLY HAVE ONE FREAKING TRAILER?
Here's a very interesting teaching called The Bible On Witchcraft, The Ocult, Demonology And Paranormal Activity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHT9b4WDP6k&t=23s
Wasnt Damien born of a jackal and not a human mother?
Ok but why not release June 6th.
Vikings anyone
I saw the original omen when I was 5 years old which was the same age as Damien. That movie scared the hell out if me! Oh and the shining also which also had a little kid who was 5 years old. And people wonder why I'm so crazy lol
Wasn't Damien's mother a jackal?
Damien is Coming 🔥😈✌️ #OmeN #CantWait
0:59 “let’s get it started and hah! Let’s get it started in here!” In reverse.
I’ve seen the trailers for this film twice now I keep thinking, in the original book/movie Damien’s mother was a Jackal. I wonder if they’re going to explain that or just change the story.
Ok jews stop it
Damien's mother was literal jackal.
Getting hints of John Carpenter’s prince of darkness
Might go down as one of the scariest movies of all time
They lied my baby mama is the first omen believe me
Excellent trailer, I'm keeping my expectations low but this looks very good, can't wait to see it in theaters.
Vikings intro is crazy.
This movie better be good. The trailer showed just enough to get me excited and want me to actually see the dang thang. I love horror. Always have. It’s just been let down after let down for awhile now. I just really want something horrifying. And to mentally make me think. Like The Hereditary meets Rosemarys Baby.
Wait a minute if this about the birth of Damian the Antichrist how and this movie is about this woman who I think is supposedly his mother, but how so I thought Damian mom was a literal Jackal, like in the original trilogy confirms it
Shouldve released it June 6, 2006
I love that nun actor
Looks like Trash..
Real G's would have released this on 6/6/26
The First Woke Omen
What a great teaser concept for a prequel film. 👏
The inclusion of “Look at me, Damien! It’s all for you!” in reverse at the end gave me chills knowing the scene that it’s from
Woke "strong independent female" garbage. No thanks.
Im in!
Viking music ?😢
Etkileyici ve sürükleyici bir film ızlenmesi tavsiye ederim
İzlemekten keyif aldığım bir film. Tavsiye ederim.
Mükemmel bir film
I thought It’s Mother was a Jackal?
Anyone else notice how that whole trailer is shot backwards?
this is one of the best trailers i’ve ever seen i think
But his mother was a jackal. The original story canon.
After so many years and one remake in 2006 we finally get an Origin Story finally 😎❤
Fragmanı baya iyi mutlaka izleyeceğim

Harika bı filim izlemeye değer ilk defa doya doya bı filim izledim. 🎉
I was very impressed and I liked it very much
It was wonderful movie
Hmmm.. What happened to the fact in the first film that Damien was born from a jackal???
I thought Damien was born from a jackal
Not bad
I love how this trailer came out, perfection.
I have seen when i have seen argylle, followed by recently dune part 2 because that is ended up so freaky.
Can someone explain is this prequel or sequel?
Is this a horror movie?
Great song
Anyone noticed the 666?
Trashhhhh
Wasn’t Damien’s mother a jackal?
At a certain  point  in my life it does look kinda good but  I  do not want to disappoint  my  son because I know that he wa to me to buy tickets  for  the  movie
I still do not know if I want to go see this one  let me think about it and then I will make my decision
A new omen movie  “The first omen” Which is a direct prequel to the original  Guessing we haven’t had another omen for over 18 years  Since the remake to the omen from 2006 I’ll look forward to seeing it
My wife on the other hand she does not really  like these type of movies  she mostly likes romantic  movies   and also comedy  movies
Oh yeah  man  I will definitely  buy  the  tickets  for  this one it is going to rule man I know my son he wants to go see this one at three  years  old  he never gets scared  of  this type of stuff  not one time does he ever have a nightmare  he sure is brave  enough  to  watch this I tell you this kid is smart   I love you buddy
Not gonna lie when i first saw a poster for “the first omen” i rolled my eyes but im completely sold by this trailer. It really feels like we’re starting to see directors with actual artistic vision getting picked up for these franchises instead of someone who has no passion nor understanding of horror. I hope the movie can live up to the creeps this trailer gave me.
The walking backwards was a nice touch. Aleister Crowley style.
Obviously nothing is original anymore. Just dig in the past for ideas for movies ugh. This better not be as shitty as the 2006 remake though
Please don't be woke, please don't be woke...
Song is fire
Can't wait
This song triggers me to watch Vikings every time.
Meh
This looks creepy, the smile reminds me of the smile movie, wonder if that's the same lady?
<3
İs this Tenet with Conjuring?
Saint Maud but reversed into The Omen? I'm down.
For those curious about the song: Fever Ray -  "If i had a heart"
What a great trailer. Seriously.
This is what happens when you take an artist and say hey feel free to do your thing, instead of saying hey one for one copy that guy.
The had me at Fever Ray.
Vikings
So the omen is now a girl and not a boy like we know where it first started will she be defeated or make a path for them
Gayet başarılı mükemmel bir yapıt olmuş
Music from the Vikings series ?
So that means out on bluray in July 2024! Looking forward to this movie, as the original Omen with Gregory Peck is a true classic!

A possessed tyranny as the Omen ..awesome...
why is there alot of prequels coming out all of the sudden ?
But why Vikings theme song?
This trailer got me hooked.
Really? Remake again? Loosers with no new ideas!
All the true og know where this soundtrack came from. Vikings😊
STEALING THE VIKINGS THEME  BETTER SHOW  LONG LIVE RAGNAR LOTHBROK
Nothing will beat the original Omen.
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Another piece of antiCatholic propaganda. Making it look like Catholics will bring the Antichrist about...

My MPA Prediction. Rated R for violence, disturbing images, some language and brief sexual content.
We need a second trailer now!
Is this viking series song?
It's an omen! A REALLY BAD OMEN!!! OH WE'RE ALL DOOMED!!!
Be ready.  I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father(GOD) except thru me (JESUS). John 14:6 Jesus died for your sin believe and repent today.
in reverse what does this movie mean ???
Strange, after hearing this song I felt like invading England!
Having watched the original Omen just a few months back, the tone of this doesn't even feel similar. The original was subtle, but just from the trailer, this new one feels more like any of the generic horror films that get released every year.

why dont they leave the nuns alone
Thought Damian was born of a Jackal?
This trailer is like the intro to american horror story
A lot of nun movies coming out lately, I see a sign.
Can someone explain what this movie's about
Everyone in Hollywood should take notes on how to make a good trailer, that captures your attention without giving anything away. You can piece some small things together, just enough to be intrigued and check it out. Wish more trailers were like this!
Goosebumps. This is the best trailer I’ve seen since Judas and the Black Messiah. 😲💯
IDL horror movies, but this trailer gave me goosebumps. It’s the best I’ve seen since Judas and the Black Messiah. 😲💯
Can you make another live action movie for Alvin and the Chipmunks? Let the movie focus on the Chipettes.
is she Damian mother?🤔
why the F they put Vikings theme to this?
Awful music for the trailer. What is this? 2005?
🍇🍇🍇🍇 🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇
Can you make another live action movie of Alvin and the chipmunks?
The twist: it’s a girl!! 😱😱😱
I'm intrigued but Nothing beats the original The OMEN 1 & 2. The remake was such a failure.
I don’t think il like it  I don’t think it be good but will still watch it
Is this patt of the Omen movies?
Song: Fever Ray 'If I Had A Heart'
I want my 1:04 back
Kinda not digging how this might not follow David Seltzers Lore. Honestly these are different times and most of us know already the antichrist is a force that has already infiltrated our societies. Its timefor a new story that can resonate with the current global turmoil.
Why pretend that its just a movie?  Your people are the demons and devils that the good book speaks of.  This is your true nature and culture.  RPETCMNEOESDFDURGAAPSPWDAVDUEPDFEBB
Even though  it was a dumpster fire to most I actually  liked the omen TV show it was dark and wasn't afraid to paint the church  in a bad light and showed some good  in the Damien character. Plus it had a killer opening theme. I'm looking forward to this.
Somebody can tell me who's playing this version of you know you're right by Nirvana 😮😮😮😮 awesome cover!!
Theme song seems familiar....
Nothing will beat the original
When i heard the music soundtrack,, i thought it was another series of the Vikings😂
I love this actress ! I've known her since "Servant" !
🤮
People were fans of it, knew the origin already, here they go screwing it up cause it "Needs a human element".  You guys need to hire new writers or just stick to the book.
I heard they changed the origin from the source material, why even waste your time and money? DOA
Now I understand why YT removed the dislike button
this looks absolutely awesome
looks like they’ over did it with thee special affects  people are obsessed with all kids of weirdness 👊🏽
I'll preserve judgement 😈
got confused for a few seconds. was expecting Vikings for some reason
Oooh... the trailer is weird. Hope it won't disappoint like what happened to The Exorcist: Believers.
Music sounds like music from Vikings...or am I wrong?
So the jackal turned into a woman? F this...just stop with this BS
I am a big fan of the 1976 film, I hope this film does it justice!
This song belongs on the Vikings only 😂☠️💕
Interesting, glad to see the girl from that Apple show in more creepy movies/shows
The music from the last kingdom tv series
"To control those who don't believe create something to fear."
Omen can you smoke ?
Omen from valorant?
This looks good. So this is how it started
Wtf are they playing viking music to this?
If anyone remembers in the original, it was a jackal that gave birth to the antichrist; I wonder if that will come into play in this film.
I love If I Had a Heart since I first heard it through Vikings opening credits. Such a vibe with the song; eerie, mysterious, and beautiful. It’ll make any trailer good
NAH, I LIKE THE ORIGINAL 1976 THE OMEN
Season 7. Ragnar, faces his toughest battle yet...
Simply terrible trailer.
Vikings😊
NOTHING LIKE ORIGINALITY. CAN'T BEAT THAT FIRST FILM.
ill surely see it, my favourite subject
Just a guess , Damiens  mother???😈😈😈
A HAUNTING PREQUEL TO THE AWARD-WINNING 1976 CULT CLASSIC HORROR FILM "THE OMEN". 😈🎬🎥😱
What a great trailer
Fake views lete hai fraud company se
boring….
Looks ridiculous  ...! ..  ( I smell Razzie)
Vikings theme song
When a franchise has done sequels, reimaginings, remakes and tv shows, might as well give the prequel approach to The Omen
Why did this feature the Fever Ray song used on the TV show "Vikings"?  I just found that confusing
0:16 It's Father Brennan
Looks like a completely unrelated movie that they decided to slap The Omen franchise on to.
Please let it be good.
walay klaro
My fav ..before the conjuring..
ভালরান্ত
I saw this before All of Us Strangers and typically pay no mind to all these endless religious horror films, but this one hit different.  The music was really good and all the scenes are presented in reverse.  It’s really effective and the direction looks better than all those Nun Nun 2 Insidious Exorcist fare…
0:25 the lights & candle placements looks like the face of a demon.
Looks fantastic
The score reminds me of Vikings
Vikings song took me out of it lol
666
"Leanne Grayson" is in the movie!
Should not have used the title music for the Viking’s…….
Actually only Christians get possessed. Others who don't share the delusion don't get possessed
VIKINGS SEASON 9 FINALLY
Looks lame...
someone please tell me what this song is called. i’ve been searching for it since breaking bad
This looks so F 'ing good
Nice trailer
Oh what a mess! This seems like a cheap stealing of bits and pieces of other successful horror films, such as: Nun Nun II Mirrors  Dracula  Rosemary's Baby Exorcist  Smile Stigmata and more... Background music also stolen, unoriginal, and NOTHING compared to the score of the original Omen (Ave Satani) which sends shivers down my spine even as I name it and recall it. I don't think I'll even give this film a chance. I also enjoyed the 2006 remake with Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, even though it didn't have the creepy music of the original and in spite of me not generally being a fan of remakes. I really don't like to jump to conclusions, but I'm thinking that a trailer is usually the best attempt to attract the audience's attention and interest, and this is the best the came up with? Zero for originality
Omen movies my childhood favorite horror movies 😀❤️👍
this trailer is different keeps you engaged without that much spoilers  - love that
Midsommer?
All the famous horror movie scenes, camera angles and Enigma video fused together
Is that Fever Ray?
💤
Damien birth came from a Jackal in the Omen , changing it to a woman breaks original Canon
fever ray yessssssss
If its a remake how does the trailer not give anything away?
This looks so good visually, hope they pull it off with the plot.
If anyone need any trailer BGM . Just @ me and drop the name
you are increasingly impatient, showing that you are slaves of Satan, and openly insulting religion, remember who is the first to laugh mockingly at the one who will cry and regret at the end, God (Allah ta ala) exists, and evil will surely perish
OMEN IS BLACK
Hey 20th century studios can you make a movie called (amazing digital circus the movie) glitch gooseworks 20th century studios PG
The Omening
The Omen. This movie just remind me to my father, he really adored this movie somuch
The Vikings audio
Vikings music…..odd choice for music given it’s so iconic
Did anyone else catch the 666 in the woman's mouth when shes screaming? Its @ 43 seconds, only lasts a second!
It should've said from the producers of antlers and the night house.
Looks absolutely dreadful. I won’t be paying to watch this.
why use the vikings opening theme though LMAO
❤
This is not a prequel to the first omen because none of the original characters are in it
We want Chronicles of Narnia 4,5,6 and 7 th movie parts ! .
first omen was million times less expensive and million times better
I hope this is about his past and not a reboot. It looks good!!!
Lots of good shots to choose from with so little footage, but I'd say my favorite is the one with the glove 0:41
This trailer did not feel like a horror movie
Fevers Ray’s song!!!! ❤❤❤❤
That's the song from Vikings🤔🤔🤔
one of the best trailers i've ever seen, amazing use of Fever Ray, i hate most of todays posessions horrors, but this above made me wanna watch it
whats the song?
I hope its actually good
vikings music
Is this based on that book named The Omen?
First second of Fever Ray's music got me hooked.
I am a simple guy. I see a movie trailer starring Denzel Washington, I watch the movie.
WAITAMINUTE I THOUGHT THE ANTICHRIST CHILD CAME FROM A JACKAL???
I only assume the Jackal will make an appearance?
Woke Omen...
So is Ragnar Lothbrook going to kill the antichrist in this?
Put a chick in it, and make it lame really is the motto for movies these days.
Vikings
Is this the remake of the Omen franchise?
viking opening
Feels like a cure for wellness
Vikings Theme Song!!!
Very good
pretty actress!
Love the easter egg for the fans of the original movie with the reverse sound at 0:58. "Look at me Damien. It's all for you!"
R.I.P RAGNAR
Okay I remember the soundtrack from Vikings intro but never thought of it in the context of a horror movie. I got chills!
This trailer is superb! Very well done.
Why are all these people walking backwards?
El primer revés en la historia, cuando hacen esos tráilers de este tipo...👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
NEMO
Loving the Viking song!! Had my attention; Looks good 🐕
hail ragnar!
Disney 🤮
Tbh, it is rare to get differently formatted/edited trailers nowadays. I'm glad there are people out there still trying!
"Look at me Damian, its all for you" for those wondering what was said in reverse speed at the end..
Reminds me of the movie Stigmata
Oh vikings I miss it  but this music adds more to the suspense of the trailer as not a whole lot is given away like normally these days.
bu fraggman aşırı dikkat çekici ve filmi merak ettirtiyor gerçektende heyrcanlandım yaaaa hemen izlicem 🎉
The ending of Omen 3 speaks for itself. Standing before Christ the Antichrist and with him Satan vanished into insignificance. LOVE it!
I'll be watching this!
Vikings season 6
Nice
That looks cliche as fk but I’ll give it a try. Can’t judge too much from a trailer. I remember the trailer to Pet Sematary remake looked really good, then I watched the film and hated it 😂
Is this a prequel to "The Omen"? 🤔
So is this a prequel to the original Omen movies???
Wait is this part of "the omen" movie series? Yessss lets gooo !
For anyone wondering: The song is "If I Had A Heart" by Fever Ray.
Five seconds in im like “this is Nell tiger coded” 💀 Ohhh would you look at that 🥹
si Omen
vikings intro song
New Vikings season looks strange
OooooooOh
Ragnar 🙌🏻
so this will be....  how a priest and a jackal fall in love?
Fantastically made trailer, quick in and out to get the point. I shall see you in April!
The trailer reminds us of the Viking series
big production companies make outstanding trailers... we shall see if the movie lives up to it
this is the vikings intro song
⛱️⛱️⛱️ ⛱️⛱️ ⛱️⛱️⛱️
please release the full version of this song! huhuhu 😭
Congratulations
Good trailer. Btw i was watching this and thinking about the Vikings because of the music 😂
Liked the lead actor when she was in The Servant—looks good
The song will always belong to Vikings...
What an excellent day for an Exorcism
Now that's what I call, Trailer of the Movies.
First heard this song in the Vikings series.....very cool
Creepy visuals with this will never end background music 🔥
THERE ARE NO MORE ORIGINAL IDEAS IN HOLLYWOOD! don't support this
Weird trailer everything is going backwards!
Why are they using the Vikings soundtrack?
The Vikings track is really misplaced.
I am always skeptic with reimagined and remakes, prequels, sequels, etc., I know a lot likes and praises the trailer, but to me it's too vague, so far, not enough to peak my interest. But who knows, this just might be good.
Are we seeing the birth of Ragnar Lothbrok?
Love how the entire trailer runs backwards.. even the 20th century lights, awesome 💯
And then she became a viking...
Loved this song from VIKINGS...
"Look at me Damien, it's all for you..." in reverse at the very end of the trailer...nice touch.
someone stole a spoon and someone who says btitch alot is riding a go kart
New trilogy or prequel 1976?
Not my cup of "ju ju."
Now I want to watch vikings miss this opening 😭
Çok güzel, Çok harika Çok beğendim severek izliyebilirsiniz
THIS MOVIE LOOKS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the vibe seems real indie
Boring
This is a fantastic trailer.
First time I’ve seen a horror trailer not show almost everything
Amazing
that's how you do a trailer, don't give everything away
The song playing in the background is If I Had A Heart by Fever Ray.
Ok so we are trying again? Halloween, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Mummy, The Wolfman 😕
Great trailer. Looking forward to seeing this
Hey, that's Viking's theme music
_Sanguinem... bibimus..._ _Corpus... edimus..._
The jackal demanded too much money, so they went with a generic, pretty actress for the mother.
used to like christian horror genre, this seems unoriginal...
Oh great April 5th the day my birthday is on😈
Leanne !?!?!?!
ahh i remember the viking series, that song, if anyone has seen vikings knows what i mean
All I got from this is I need to binge watch Vikings again …SKOL!!
Sônia Braga belíssima de freira (irreconhecível 😮) algum Br por aq 🙋🏾‍♀️🤳🏾
Omg soo excited! I hope this is the only trailer to this movie. We know too much spoils it.
Now that's what u call a trailer!! Can't wait!!
I bet if u play this movie trailer backwards theres a hidden meaning ... 🤔
only the song doesnt fit....it would be better if they used a song from the same artist called ``WOLF``
Viking soundtrack :D
The background score is epic. The trailer is fast and thrilling. ❤
I'll give this a peak.
Nell Tiger Free has got a knack for playing Sinister Characters !!
Looks incredible
Great..I will wait for this movie.❤🎉
This looks so bad, but we shall see
wtf was that....
This looks like a rip off of the Exorcist
HOLLYWOOD just stop.  Making another souless PREQUEL/REBOOT that nobody ask for.  Theres a reason THE OMEN and THE EXSORCIST a timeless cult-classic. They were made for their own TIME-PERIOD. You can't replicate those moments. sorry
Guys cant even have the anti-christ be one of their own now.
🙏😑The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We all must be willing to turn from sin and believe and follow Jesus for forgiveness. 1st John 2:17 He who does the will of God abides for eternity. That’s letting Jesus live His life in and through us His children, by knowing and obeying the Word of God !!! ❤️📖nkjv🙏🧎🏻‍♂️🕊🇺🇸🕊
This was a pretty good trailer
If the trailer is anything To go by, it's gonna be brilliant 👏 👌 🎟🎥🎬
Better off being its own film but attaching the Omen to this might prove more bankable
M.NIGHT’s SERVANT PREQUEL
Typical Stupid English horror never ending story movie
Great trailer! I take it this is a prequel? Perhaps following Damien's real mother, leading up to the first film.
Regardless of how the film turns out: That's a very well-made trailer! Gold Star for using Fever Rey!
adding a title song from Vikings felt a bit out of place
The choice of having the trailer backward is very very interesting (coupled with that incredible music, almost makes me want to watch the movie). To me it can mean two things linked to story. One, we are going backward to go back in time before the event of the original movie. Two, the church is out of his way by creating something evil and so goes in the wrong direction, backward.
The original Omen is how a classic horror should be filmed.  The child actor had all the Satan vibes.
The Antichrist 666🤮🤮🤮☝️
The Vikings theme song?
Do you remember this song from Netflix series Dark? or am I the only one? 😂😊
Isnt that Vikings theme songs
At first I was like someone is watching viking
holy hell im possesed by satan
This is how you make a trailer! Well done!
So...the Antichrist is a Viking?  ODIN'S BALLS! LET'S GET OUR RAGNAROK ON!
"The Woke-Omen" if the Woke sequel of the exorcist wasn't enough...
this looks amazing!!!
What is this? a prequel, a reboot, a sequel? I dont get it
Finally no cookie cutter trailer music
Interesante 😃🫶
From 0:59 onwards it says: "You went to the trouble of reversing this to feel clever? Do you have rocks in your head? Something something... Rolling Stones."
vikings fans are having Goosebumps
story focuses on how Damien was conceived, Swapped with a diplomat's child
Just reversed the last sound effect heard at 0:58  When reversed, it's actually "Look Damien, it's all for you!" from the original 1976 "The Omen" -- the scene where Damien's nanny kills herself. So smart to include that in a trailer where EVERY shot is reversed. Looking forward to this one!
Vikings soundtrack,yeah I'm sat
Yooo this is the Vikings intro song , brought back some good memories of my favourite show!
Finally, The Prolog Before the OMEN
Huh.  An Omen / Vikings crossover movie.  Didn't see that coming.
If you were wondering, the reversed audio at the end (0:59) is the line from the original “Look at me Damien! It’s all for you!”
How creative. Same opening titles music as Vikings :(  Rubbish ahead !
Not scared
I think we are supposed to play this in reverse.
If you watch this in reverse, the title screen dialogue says; "Look at me Damien, its all for you".
Wow
What is the song in this trailer?
I remenber watching the remake when i was a teen at the release on 06/06/06
Quite possibly, this film is the biggest promise for cinema in 2024. From the trailer, it already promises to live up to the classic!
Isn't it this damian's organ story
Anyone Watching This in 2024?
Vikings soundtrack??
So Rosemary's child is next. Remaking classic movies, why did Redownload them?
So Rosemary's child is next. Remaking classic movies, why did Redownload them?
No Jackals then?
What is that song?
Love that extreme eyeball shot! Imagine that one on the BIG screen
If this was made by A24 I'd be even more excited...curious to see what comes of it. Looks interesting
Why use music that is inextricably entwined with a very popular--and still quite recent--television show? So distracting.
This is probably the single worst trailer I've ever seen in my life.
getting close to your eyes on that screen
Isn't that the song used for the intro of Vikings?
bill nighyyyy
This movie trailer wasn't cool enough to use Fever Ray's "If I Had A Heart" as it's theme.
TENET vibes in this horror movie
Vikings
Well, you don't get to use the Vikings soundtrack.
Wasn't Damien's mother a jackal?
Kinda stupid to use “vikings” intro soundtrack, because to most people that song is forever tied to the viking series. Using this song in a horror movie trailer, makes the trailer itself less creepy and interesting. It’s like using game of thrones’s intro theme in a new horror movie trailer, it just doesn’t work. It’s so weird they did this while there are 1000s of other good real creepy sounding, unknown songs just waiting to be discovered.
Here are two major reasons why this film won't come close to the success or popularity of 'The Omen' (1976) or both of its sequels:  1. Bill Nighy is in it (and he can't act).  But most importantly:  2. This film is immediately distanced from the original three films as it doesn't have the guaranteed success ingredient - a score by Jerry Goldsmith.
Confuse with the trailer..:)
just in case anyone is curious, the backwards message in the end is "Look at me Damien, it's all for you."
Is she going to be the real mother of Damien? With the Jackals? 😮
What’s with the Viking music?
1976 Omen is my favourite horror film ever so will see how this goes 😮
trailers that don’t give away anything >>>>>
Disney will do anything for a quick cash grab these days, Marvel, Lucas Film, 20th Century Fox, who is next?  About this film, I don't like horror movies, but I am intrigued.
RAGNARRRRRR MY KING ( ragnar not here guys just the music but perfecto )
Totally feeling this trailer. Great job. Love the track they used. VIKINGS!! and it's great to see Nell Tiger Free from the Servant again.
As long as it’s better than the exorcist believer
The girl from got and servant with the music of vikings. You already bought me hahaha😆😆😆😆😆
That ending says that in reverse voice says "Look at me Damien, It's all for you." which I was surprised this voice comes to reverse from the end of trailer but which is surprised 😳❤
I'm curious if this is also a back story for Damian's satanic nanny
Finally something worth seeing!
For a second I thought this was Vikings when the song started playing
Coming soon the prequel of The French Connection
Can’t wait to review this!!!
Was it me, or did the video restart again and showed only the two women on the floor. One was saying something but the sound of the trailer was still playing 😳😳😳
Ok. But is this the origin of Damien, cause according to the very first movie, a jackal was the mother of Damien. Am I wrong?
i miss Ragnar .
What a sweet sweet edit on the trailer, this is how you hook up a human mind !
It doesn't matter the plot. I will also watch this movie for the heroine's face.😍
At least I know the secret message hidden at the end.
Viking intro music nooooooo
His mother was a jackal!
That's Damions real mom!
Everything yes!!!! No more trailers. I'll watch. Don't spoil anymore!!!!!
Thought i was watching the Tenant trailer with all the backwards going on
If you like horror movies the It chapter 1 2017 is a masterpiece
This looks fantastic. Can’t wait to see this when it his theatres because I love the omen from 1976
hope this is not feminist antichrist crap
The soundtrack made me think it was a vikings spinoff
I just hope it'll be better than the the exorcist the believer, one of the worst movie ever
happy to see Stevenson in something new, love her in Servant
BTW, the audio clip at the end is reversed from the original Omen: "Look at me, Damien. It's all for you!"
Love me some Fever Ray.
Interesting.... I always thought that Rosemary's Baby was the secret prequel.
1 minute Official trailer ??? That's different   I hope it's not pg13 Fox lately is giving good horror movies but it is just less blood, hope this one with more blood
What a freaky spooky trailer.  Can't wait for this one
At the end of the trailer you can hear a voice speaking backwards and it’s Nancy from the original Omen! Saying “Look at me Damian, it’s all for you” lol what an awesome Easter egg! I’m so in 🤘🏽
Can't believe they're using the Vikings theme tune😂😂😂😂😂
Fantastic trailer, looked up the film and it seems its based on a great book, and has some good writers attached, and given the visual flair shown here (not just the great trailer editing, but all those shots they compiled here all individually look great) im quite intrigued. People may whine about modern movies always being a letdown but horror has been thriving in past years and continued to have a lot of acclaim
so antichrist is here.thank you for leting us know hoolywood
The Cinematography is beautiful
So many question, what will happen, who will survive, who's good personage ?
This looks AMAZING - especially loved the theme song omg
Vikings intro 🔥🔥🔥
Loving the Fever Ray opening track :) :) yes!
Is this horror ? I hate horror movies...
I just want the original theme. All this is trying to do is make vikings come off as the devil's puppets
I realise trailers sometimes use different uncomposed music.   This is the theme for the series VIKINGS
Is she the witch from the series The Servant?
im sorry but the vikings theme song does not belong in this video
Vikings BGM 🔥
LOL trying to get people interested through Nostalgia of using the Viking theme song. Fail because all I want to do is watch Vikings now🤣🤣🤣
I’m intrigued and not spoiled. Can’t wait to see the movie.
isnt this the music from the Vikings show?
Damien's mother is a Jackal.
They should do what Exorcist Believer did and downplay the religious angle. They should also mention that Damien is going to rise to power because of the patriarchy.
Vikings intro music alright then.
This is a Vikings song right
The music...brings me back to Vikings...Hail King Ragnar!!
Only because they used the tv show theme song of Vikings i will watch the movie.
Is this connected to the movie *The Omen* _(2006)_ ?
Wasn't Damians mother a Jackal?
finally we will get to see the prequel to 1975's The Omen
will we ever see the Jackal literally giving birth to the AntiChrist? or nah?
No thanks 👎
now that's a good trailer ... creepy af
I honestly thought they had already came out with an origin omen story, but this looks amazingly good ❤ I want to c more
Hey
Good video
what song is this?
Can’t be any worse than the omen tv show .
So... according to the lore, this girl is gonna get it on with a jackal....
Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and The Omen are the greatest demonic trifecta. They tried and failed to resurrect The Exorcist. I have very little faith that this will be any better
Desperate attempt to connect to a decent movie again. Woeful.
*Danggggg the music hooked me* 🫢🙌🏼💆🏻
Great trailer!!!
Song is If I Had A Heart by Fever Ray, thank me later
Damien will rise !
Wat the name of this song
Hope this is good  That 1976 film is still really effective  Hollywood don’t ruin this
Great
As much as I like the novel and 1976 film, I was hoping this prequel would be a reboot.The 2006 remake and Damien TV show had a few interesting concepts.
David Gordon Green didn’t have anything to do with it, so it might actually be watchable.
Ragnof loftbrook
I usually skip trailers but this one was fantastic
Somebody seriously needs Visine or Clear Eyes, devil possessed or not!
Damien wasn't born of a human, He was born from a jackal
So who's gonna risk and reverse the reversed female voice at the end for me? Not tryna contract that curse.
The first film is still amazing for its age. There are few films which match its mounting sense of dread. The pivotal scene in the graveyard is the stuff of nightmares.
This is some A24 level trailer editing .   Hopefully the movie is actually good even though if ppl seen the original omen films and know the lore , this woman is either going to start off as a good person in the beginning of the movie and gets brainwashed into serving the cult and becomes Damian’s guardian from the original movie or she ends up giving birth to the jackal , which would be gnarly .
This film going to be so interesting definitely checking it out
Fever ray!!! ❤❤❤
FIRST  The Omen, is legendary with Legendary cast, truly just the story was chilling & scare U beside the scenes , LOOOVED IT is A+ to me Bought , own & watched  it on DVD/BLURAYS digital f*n everywhere, i hope this is good NOT another f*n  The Exorcist: Believer crap was  as they took a shyt on the orginal  The Exorcist
🤩🔥🤯👊🏻amazing
This is cinema 😮
Holy crap, the sound byte at the end in reverse is from the Original The Omen when the nanny takes her own life and says, “Look at me Damien, it’s all for you!”
What is the name of this song?
From servant to this. She’s always playing in something  creepy haha
this trailer reminds me VIKINGS ❤
Damien’s mother was a jackal, not a woman.
beginning of a new series
Looks interesting
Yet another unnecessary prequel movie. Nothing here resembles the Omen except the triple 6. Like who was asking for this. Trying to s*x up the Onen like what?
If its not Damien...hard pass
Music copy from vikings web series 🌚
Good video 👍📸
the problem is we still need to wait for the baby to grow up...maybe another chapter then....
Looks better than Wokexorcist
Looks outstanding. Reminds me of Possession or artsy demonic Italian films from the 70s and 80s
This will be just as horrible as the other horror films Hollywood has churned out over the past two or three decades.
I love Fever Ray, but I need Jerry Goldsmith.
Vikings If I had a Heart theme song Chills me up😮
why is viking theme song playing?  its weird i expect to see Ragnar when i hear this
That's the Vikings music
All I can think of is the show Vikings while listening to this song.
This looks incredible.  I sure loved the Omen movies with Damien.  I hope that those movies are revisited, and that they start a new trilogy based upon Damien or his descendants.
Can anyone tell me the song name?
All I can think of when I hear this is the vikings 😅
Never see this coming, because the trailer is reversed.
I wonder if Nell ever called Charles "Grandpa" on set.
Tiger!!🐯🐯🐯💕
Oh wow a Church conspiracy to make Catholics look bad, how original !
So much music in the world and you had to reuse the theme from Vikings for this?
This gives Tenet vibes
Another one? 🤦‍♂️ Spring is horror movie season. How do they keep making money every year?
Interesting I will definitely watch this movie even though no one knows who the Antichrist will be. He doesn't even realizes he is the Antichrist  until half way through the great Tribulation. Keep in mind there are 2 Antichrist that will deceive the world the false Prophet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZx4WQTmGAw
Someone discovered what were the last words in the trailer going backwards?
The First Omen is a prequel to the original 1976 occult thriller film, The Omen is far worse than scary and I ever imagine, when I was watching the teaser trailer has two days ago! 😨😱😰😭😈👿☠️
😂😂😂 The song is consumed by Vikings
Ivar
How to destroy a legacy for greed.
The music was also featured at the beginning of each episode of History Channel's Vikings!
Seems like Kesha is going for movie roles these days. Now she’s begging for mercy at the feet of the Lord.
Damiens mother wasn't human though, is this film meant to portray that this is who gave birth to him?
Vikings theme song 🎵
Viking vibe😂😍
VIKINGS - theme song copied✅
The Omen got gender swapped? Already been done and it failed.
Why is that trailer convincing me to watch Vikings again!👹✨
Powerful trailer.
Marvel Studio presents The First Omen: Infinity Omen
That is how trailer to be made
Looks better than the last  Omen TV series , Omen Remake and Omen 4 and Omen 2 .  Hoping it’s a quality effort and not another Christian  horror sequel/prequel made by Hollywood atheist looking for a quick buck .
am i trippin but i swear one of the clips is a scene from the movie "smile" ??
Looks terrible
Looks Like A Tim Burton Movie.
This looks so good and this song is so creepy and invokes a primal fear feeling in me for some reason
The first omen is a good  movie to see this year
i want to watch vikings again
Girlfriend likes starring in  dark plots with baby problems😂
What is the voice saying at the end of the trailer?
Somebody play that last part backwards and tell me what it says please 😂
"Look at me Damien. This All for you". Ending teaser trailer word backward..
Justo acabo de terminar de ver " Servant". Nell tiger 🔥
Hilarious how the new exorcist trilogy cost over 200 million and it was a joke altho im soo happy Ellen finally got the millions she deserves
I don't know why this film is being made the original literally told Damien's backstory he was born from a Jackal so what is the point of this film?
Since Disney now owns 20th Century Studios, does this make the Anti-Christ a Disney princess?
Why do I feel like I’m getting ready to watch an episode of Vikings 😅
Had no idea Fever Ray was used in Vikings, but excellent use here.
Looks interesting, but I thought Damien was born from a jackal? This was mentioned several times in the films was the skeleton of said jackal was shown. Plus, he has the blood of one.  If this is a retcon, I’ll overlook it if the movie’s good.
She is super interresant and entellektüel she is not from church
What is this? Vikings?
The baby that was born was a boy not a girl. Nothing will beat the original with Gregory Peck.
The trailer, dare I say it has me rather intrigued
BREAKING BAD SONG
Like Willy Wonka, another prequel nobody asked for. 😅 Way to ruin the Vikings them song.
0:32 😮😮 i peed in my pants 😮😮😩😣😖😖
An odd choice for trailer music considering it’s already synonymous with Vikings lol
Will this be the first film Disney releases this year? (For those who don't know, Disney owns the film rights for 20th Century Fox)
Flaming Dumpster Fire of Garbage. Change the title to "The Worst Omen" right away.
KUDOS for not having that intro where that says "THE TRAILER STARTS NOW " 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This teaser looks like a fan edit
I don't know her but I'm happy for her congratulations it looks really good I can't wait to see it🎉🎉🎉🎉
Is this The Knife doing the theme music????
The fact they didn't use Jerry Goldsmith's PERFECT Ave Satani for the trailer, and preferred Vikings' theme song is just... beyond-insulting and appalling. Another fiasco, coming right up.
Why?
The Viking intro song is great, but misplaced here.
Vikings Intro!!!!
1976 "His mother was a jackal !!" 2024 "Retcon"
You had me at Nell Tiger Free!
Boring! There is no point in watching this Prequel when the entire Trilogy had already showed the downfall of Damien Thorn in “The Final Conflict.”
This looks worse than I imagined it would. And the Vikings theme song? Really?
The Ragnar Lothbrook song!!!!
This has to be better than exorcist believer
This is how I should have felt watching the New Exorcist trailer, bravo whoever edited this. I'm hopeful that we might be onto a winner here.
Rosemary's Baby vibes.
Maria Avedici Santoya the Jackal in her human form
This looks amazing
isn't this Viking's soundtrack?
never understood the omen movies, if the antichrist is born, so that means Jesus will come back too. and in the bible, the devil loses. makes no sense.
Oh boy, female director. Brace for edgy, anti god nonsense masking as depth and substance.
this looks good
Why TF is 20th Century Studios using the opening theme song for History Channel's VIKINGS for this trailer?  LMAO... Fever Ray's "In My Heart" will always be tied to this show, sorry.   Arkasha Stevenson should have known better - WHAT A BLUNDER.
I think this movie looks great
And it all began with... A woman! Shocker! /s
صلّوا على خير الهداةِ وسلّموا ‏فهو الخليل المصطفى والأكرمُ  ‏وهو المُـقرّب لـلإلـهِ إذا أتـى ‏يوم القيامةِ والشفيعُ الأعظمُ  ﷺ
Good song. Terrible trailer. Looks like cow poop
The whole time I was waiting for Ragnar Lothbrok in the trailer.
I'm not impressed.
Umm…terrible trailer. This is not a good sign.😢
We Need more Hollywood Actors who are Eastern European/ Hungarian/ Romanian
Create something 2 fear 4.5.2024
So they just used the Vikings intro music for the trailer??
Vikings Fans Be Like...
music / song , is theme from the tv series VIKING
(0:58)the distorted woman speaking someone needs to see what she said
If you rewind the video, you can hear woman's voice saying: Look at me Damian, it's all for you!
With all that is happening in our world I've been thinking about the omen movies.
The jackal is a main story plot in the original. I don’t know how to feel about this. It can’t be any worse than Exorcist Believer though. That was poo.
Okay!  The trailer for the fifth or sixth (if you count the Omen 4 TV movie) Omen movie has no business being this good!
I'm in!! I love the Omen films!
This will forever be the Vikings opening song. Weird choice.
I love the Fever Ray song, but it took away from the trailer. If I wouldn't know the original Omen movie, I wouldn't have guessed this wants to be a horror movie. I know I will be in the minority, but I think this was a very ill fit.
People who read my name 👇
Damien’s mom was a jackal   Guess they had to fk it up somehow 😂
vikings opening
I have seen many trailers. But this one, with Vikings theme and everything in reverse, gave me real chills.
Right, this looks utter naff!  Anyone around the world who wants to place a bet?  I'm going on odds on fav this is gonna be a total flop!  I'm willing to put 100 quid (UK British pounds) on it  Who's in?
Yessss!👏🏾 Hopefully, they will use the original theme Avi Santani!
This looks so cool. Can't wait to see it.
0:43 666
What's the song 👀
If you take the time to listen to the last section’s audio in reverse it is the creepiest thing ever. Bravo to the marketing team on this one
When i hear this song i think only Vikings and nothing else
June 6, 2006 🎬 🎞 🎥 🎦 📽 🎟
Vikings intro🙄
Because the remake a few years ago had everyone clamoring for more?  🙄 Up next, 3rd remake of Black Christmas?
Wow Thats how You make a movie Trailer!!!
Hard to make a movie about the Judeo-Christian devil when *no one knows or understands the tenets of those religions anymore.*  To say nothing of people _not caring_ about the tenets of those religions anymore.
They gonna ruin it by sneak in modern woke agenda?
Credit where credit is due.  The trailer's visuals are effective (fantastic, even).  Can the director tell a story, though?  I have found that...ahem, "modern" directors can't because of the over-emphasis on conveying emotion through their images.   1) They mistake their themes for plot,  2) Their characters are stand-ins for themselves, and  3) They make their subtext the _actual dialogue._  That's not how you make a movie.
What was the name of the song?
F OFF WITH THE EXORCIST MOVIES! DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL LIKE A HAUNTED WALMART!
Feels like Suspiria, not a fan of "reinventions" but this might work.
I thought its mother was a jackal?
https://youtube.com/@DISCORDREDA?si=v9u1kS-fiA6kr9fn
I was honestly shocked when i heard Fever Ray start playing
OMFG KARIN
YOU CAN NOT USE THIS SONG WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS!
So it's a cheap rip-off fro the movie "The Omen" (1976). No thank you. I come back when Hollywood has some creative ideas again.
This song was used in breaking bad. awesome
Who thoght Vikings? 😅
Finally a trailer that doesn't spoil the whole film
The first sin
That Trailer looks interesting! I can't wait to see that Movie!
Ummmm... this is Exhibit A as to why we need a "Best Trailer" category at the Oscars.
wanna go ride go karts?
What’s the movie about
That song belongs to vikings
🙅🏼‍♀️
I thought Damien’s mother was a jackal?   That being said, I can’t wait to see this.
Well looks like it will be another shitty reboot.
For Valhalla!!!
They're using the music from Vikings
Fever ray!
no idea what franchise this is connected to but this trailer is hard asf
Disappointed. There were no Vikings
So is this about the Antichrist  ? All i saw was some nuns ?
Okay Disney
Vikings bgm
Absolutely LOVE that this trailer was played backward! Something new and i haven't seen that done before!
I wouldn’t brag too much.
The 20th century fox Original omen movie will always be the greatest along with Warner Bros original film the Exorcist nobody can ever beat these two classic films.
Damien is back. How I have longed for this reincarnation of the Anti-Christ. 😈😈😈😈😈😈
If they aren't using any of Jerry Goldsmiths themes, they shouldn't even bother. Remember The Last OMENS music? Do you remember the last Omen?
Wack.
Deductive Logic: Vikings were avant-garde...
Wasn't expecting much, but at least looks better than Exorcist Believer. Nice visual style.
So tired of same story plot movies, sooo predictable. Huge pass!
Wicket, sinful, and evil. No thank you, I won't be watching this film.
When I hear If I had A Heart by Fever Ray I think of the Vikings tv show intro.
The end is saying “Look at me Dameon, it’s all for you”
Anybody know the name of the song?
I reversed the sound at the end of the trailer, a voice says “Look at me Damien! It’s all for you.”
Odd choice for a Tenet prequel but I'll watch it.
Reverse video?
Hmmm, this trailer about the prequel to "The Omen"... definitely got my attention .....
Trailer that gives nothing.
The omen already came out years ago and omen 2 also. Come up with something original
The reason it’s backwards is because the devil would hide certain messages backwards in music and movies.
Has anybody tried reversing the audio around the end of the trailer?
Please Be A Good Movie!
Vikings music took me out of this big time.
Another unimaginative sequel no one asked for. And when it flops, I don't want to see complaints from those who propped it up as something it was never going to be.
Looks trash
First off, I am not a fan of a trailer in reverse; is this to distract us from the lack of any cohesive narrative?  Second, why is the trailer's music the Intro song to the TV show Vikings; did not feel like a horror film? Third, this movie felt nothing like Omen; it felt like a generic "Devil-themed" horror-ish low budget film. It feels cheap and just thrown together as a money grab IP. Where is the originality? It's a pass for me.
I have never seen a movie trailer reversed like this. But wow did they do an incredible job on it.
Yooo Fever Ray's music finally being tapped for a trailer! ❤
Is Damien a girl now? WTF!
I'm gonna enjoy watching this
Ué mas a mãe do Damian meio que não era literalmente uma cadela?
after exorcist believer, nah we good
I'm genuinely interested and excited for it. At the very least it won't be like The Nun 2 and Recent exorcist films.
This is one of the most effective trailers I have seen in a while.  Doesn't show too much, doesn't have the typical formulaic music and jumpscare sequences.  I rate it
you gotta be kidding me. you had to tarnish Vikings with this????
Hum, that song/soundtrack is really AWESOME! Who did the music for this? Hopefully the same composer/artists as the full film.
The ending clip played in reverse says, "Look at me, Damien. It's all for you." Said by the nanny who hung herself from the 1976 The Omen.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
That distorted voice at the end. It wasn’t distorted. I think whoever that voice was, she was speaking backwards. I don’t know what she was saying, but I know backwards language when I hear it. So what was she saying?
Trash!! t will be equal or worse than the Exorcist movie.
Porque tiene la música de Vikings?
in the end it's all for you Damien?
So the plot of these movie is about the nanny or the Nun?
Finally a trailer that doesn't spoil the whole film and is edited well enough to get the general vibe of the movie.
@20thcenturystudios on April 5th on theater's. The first Omen.
Damien Thorn belongs to the Valhalla
Unexpected development in movie land . I'll watch this in a theater.
Some 4 months back, I had just a thought. That something related to Omen, should be made by Hollywood, and here it is!!!
Don't get it...Damien was born of a jackal.
song has me hooked in, and i dont mind sharing that one bit.
not sure the vikings theme tune works for this trailer  Fever Ray 'If I Had A Heart'
This seems promising. Both the trailer and official poster looked good. Of course this could just be an example of good marketing but I hope this movie will be as good as the marketing
Further proof if any was needed that Hollywood has run out of ideas,so this is a remake of a terrible remake🙄
Looks awful WTF is this. Didn't learn from The Exorcist The Beginning???
I know and love this song but cant for the life of me remember the name of it or where it's from...not sure if it just reminds me of something but can someone help me out, please, lol
Excellent! Well done Arkasha Stevenson.
Okay I need a second trailer to convince me to go see it.. that was weak.. now wha they should of done was continued after part 4... where the little girl and the baby brother were older and wanted to run the world as  powerful evil siblings but 4 was a flop ... and 4 was made decades ago .so...
OMG
I'd bet any money that last reversed bit of dialouge at the very end was the "DAMIEN It's ALL FOR YOU!" line from the OG Donner movie.
QUE TAL HIJOS DE ODIN
The First Omen is a scary prequel to The Omen!
if i see a weird kid staring and pointing at me i bring out the cross and they run away 😅
so, is this movie about damien? or a kid that came before damien?
Not sure how I feel about this. Trilogy is a high watermark for horror, don't blow it! 👍
Wow... The trailer is in reverse... Edgy
That's a B.S trailer
Disney is wylin for this
This trailer is actually quite refreshing
What's the backwards message at the end?
Has anyone reversed the backward masking at the end yet? What does it say?
Can't wait to see it.
So this is basically showing how Damion comes into being.
This looks cool but I’m not sold just yet I need to see more of this. 🤔
Love it already! Will be getting tickets!
Is it me or does this look like another The Nun movie
Nell is perfect for this role. If you have not watched  "Servant" go watch it
It looks interesting, but my interest is extremely low because that shot for shot remake of The Omen was dogshit.  It was a complete carbon copy of the original with nothing original or different about it, and honestly… making this film a prequel seems unnecessary to me since the original was a classic in its own right.  I do want to be proven wrong because it looks interesting, but I don’t want this film to end up being similar to The Thing (2011) which I found it pretty disrespectful in areas (but I blame that on the writing and the studio interferences).
Fever Ray ❤
The whole point behind the Omen series was putting Satan's child with a powerful family. I'm honestly tired of the whole nun and convent theme. 😴Oh and wasn't Damien's biological mom a jackal? They found a jackal carcass in her grave, not a nun. Please stay true to the original if you remake films.
This whole trailer is in reverse
Vikings ❤❤❤❤
Can’t believe it’s 2023 and I’m excited for an Omen reboot. This looks like it could be really good though
She was great in servant, so I can’t wait to see how she will do in this.
Trailer looks good more like a teaser. It is cut like a music video im sure the actual movie will just end up being a basic devil cult flick though overall looks good this far.
So, Damien Thorn wasn't the first one to cause an omen?
20th Century Studios = Disney.  That explains the "put a chick in it and make it lame"
Ohh Ragnar... ☠️🥺
So is this the mother that turns into a cow 🐮 jackal thing in the beginning
so scary to me that we live in a world where ppl associate this song with vikings and not breaking bad
That's the theme to Vikings!!!
Looks dumb.
Look at me Damien, it's all for you! When the audio is reversed at end of trailer
Just have to comment and brag—this is my cousin’s first Hollywood film! She’s the director, Arkasha Stevenson, and just a genuinely wonderful human being! Couldn’t be more proud
The Omen with Vikings in it... Interesting.
Damien Thorn is Antichrist
In The Omen, wasn't Damien's mother a jackal? Like, really famously a big plot point that she was a jackal?
for those curious the as to what the voice at the end says its: "Look at me Damien! It's all for you!"
Nice! The backwards talking at the end is the nanny saying "look at me Damien! It's all for you!"
Pointless shite!
Ho fatto parte della produzione con la mia auto e non vedo l'ora di vedere il film e se compaio :-)
Ragnar Lothbrok approves
It's just going to be junk.
Had to be some kardashian mystery meat mongrel woman didnt it?
That song is just way too connected to Vikings, it distracted from the whole trailer.
I was expecting Valek from The Nun to show up. The possessed clergy, girl, doll meme seems overplayed by now.
I loved the original Omen trilogy. I even enjoyed the 2006 remake and the Damien series on A&E. I’m so hyped for this.
This trailer came up as an ad then I immediately came here to watch it again 😂
The Omen prequel but make it like Ari Aster's
I’m here for Fever Ray.
Please correct your description it's Tawfeek Barhom #TawfeekBarhom
Play it backwards and it starts with Look at me, Damien. It's all for you!
meh
If you couldn't tell already, the backwards dialogue at the end of the trailer is the nanny from the original film saying "Look at me, Damien! It's all for you."
Not smart to use the vikings opening credit music   when the franchise has a fantastic library of music by Jerry goldsmith  that could be remixed.    Only smart thing about this is people will talk about it.    Hey you see the first omen trailer ? It has the vikings opening credit music
Nah
First of all - the editing of this trailer is absolutley on point! Love it! Could be just me but I would have chosen a different piece of music tho. Looking forward to see how this project pans out
Só pelo trailer já sei que o filme foi feito com baixo orçamento, tenho quase certeza que este filme será o ganhador de 2024 como  pior filme da galáxia. 😂😂😂😂
Gentleman, Damien's Back!
I expect this of the Syfy channel. Not 20th Century Fox.
I'm calling it now- the main character will end up being Mrs Baylock.
Trying to remake a classic again I see 😅😅 good luck with that one Hollywood . Have you learned nothing ?
Why use the theme from Vikings? 🤷
WOW LOVE THE TEASER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT 20 CENTURY STUDIOS DON'T KNOW HO TO MAKE HORROR MOVIES. EXAMPLE: THE BOOGYEMAN. YOU GUYS ARE UNDER DISNEY AND YOU WILL ALWAYS MAKE MOVIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE REAL FEAR.
anyone rewind the end audio? im guessin 'its all for you damien' from the OG?
so good in servant i wanted her to be a nanny for the omen baby lol
I always feel like rewatching Vikings whenever I hear that song
This looks creative. Trailer is very creepy and mysterious. I can't wait!
The ending in reverse says “it’s all for you!“
Nell Tyga was outstanding in Servant! Gave me chills, loads of talent there...this is her shot to make the big bucks in the movie world and become GREAT
What did I just watch
This is pretty much the nun. Hopefully it’s better than nun.
This trailer was more frightening and intriguing thanThe Exorcist Believers entire movie! Im so excited for this!!
Meh
Okay “My thoughts “ Creepy just enough to keep us intrigued, very stylish and slick at parts , there’s is abit of resemblance from the original omen in some little parts. There’s a dark gothic theme surrounding the trailer especially with the main character, which could work for the movie or not and Billy Nighy seems to be the bad guy . Overall, even though it’s not a full on trailer. It’s good. but I wanna see more, possibly a second trailer . But it hasn’t disappointed me I’m still intrigued
ook. So we need to see this trailer backwards…
This has potential
Mmmmm y dónde está "Ave satani" de Jerry Goldsmith???
Okay, this was bizarre. As someone whose never watched the original Omen movie in its entirety, I don't see how this connects with the original film, even though is being marketed as a prequel to the original. Movie does look interesting though.
That reversed audio at the end from the original: "Look at me Damien. It's all for you!"
impressive trailer.
Vikinggggg🎉
Vikings?
Conjuring 4 and the Nunn 3 with the end of days movie? No thank you
Look At Me, Damien‚ It’s All You (The Omen 76)
But it’s gonna be a jackal that gives birth to him, right?
Wasn’t the omen the first omen ?
No chance this is any good. Seriously haven’t seen a well made prequel to a horror franchise ever. Gonna do as well as the new exorcist
Looks terrible....🍩
This franchise hasn't had a film for over a decade.
"Look at me Damien, it's all for you!"
That first Fever Ray album is so good
Yet another remake but orite yall ran out of ideas😢
Think I’ll just listen to Fever Ray instead
Wait , is this related to the omen movies of old? ( they were pretty good too, just too scary for my age at the time)
"It was cold."- George Costanza
doesn't look good
Edge lord emo teenager phase movie.   Pass 😂 Stick to the Gregory Peck OG.
Ever since Good Omens I can’t take horror movies about demons seriously. I just imagine Crowley is just off screen sipping wine + texting Aziraphele about the crazy sh*t other demons get up to or he’s panicking because he’s misplaced the AntiChrist
i thought it was new season of vikings with the music lol
Oh an omen movie.
A teaser in Tenet mode.
why did they use the Vikings intro song for this?
I NEVER EXPECTED TO FEATURE THE VIKINGS THEME SONG IN THIS TRAILER O_O
😂 . Another bomb and abomination to the franchise.
Now THAT'S a trailer. Super excited for this.
Fever Ray “If I Had a Heart”. A masterpiece of an album.
I love her from the  servant TV series and I think this has potential to be something fresh on this particular tale, I also love this trailer it is not what you would expect.
Yikes. Why is Hollywood determined to commit Seppuku? 😂
yawn
Might have been the worst movie trailer I’ve seen in ages..
Nell Tiger Free is beautiful
Interesting using the Vikings tv show theme song.
Lazy, unimaginative, uninspired, unnecessary. No more legacy sequels and prequels. Really, Hollywood..you can’t come up with any original ideas for storytelling?
This looks interesting and now I want to watch Vikings, Hey And A famous line Is Look at me, Damien, it’s all for you!
I mean, sure, it's a cool trailer. But wasn't the whole story kind of about the parents trying to understand what Damian was all about?   Just making the mom completely aware of what's going to happen sort of undermine that?
I just realized the whole trailer is in reverse
Thats the kind of trailer I like, it gives up nothing but give you a glimpse of what to expect. It's also creative which is a plus.
Not a fan. What’s the story? I’m thinking it’s about someone who was the antichrist before Damien? It’s kinda been done where someone was the antichrist other than Damien in Omen IV. Not impressed. Damien should be the first
I didn’t even focus on the trailer because or I could see and hear is KING Ragnar!!!!!! #Vikings season ⛏️
A premissa da bomba
Floki Approves
Floki approves
Creative trailer. Intriguing.
The original omen is one of my all timw favorite horror movies, acting,pace,deaths and the amazing academy award score. The sequels are good ,the remake ok ,the tv series boring . So this prequel could a least fun .
It's Leanne from Servant. Don't trust her with a baby!
Probably going to be bad but I like that chick from that Apple Tv show the Servant.
Honestly, it looks more sexy than scary, haha. I'm gonna watch it.
VIKINGS!
What is the song/music?
And the name is RAGNAR LOTHBROOK
This looks interesting and now I want to watch Vikings.
So this is another Vikings spinoff
WTF is that
Anyone wanna ride go carts now?
Shill shill shill shill shill.  Shill shill shilly shill!
Omg a retelling of a popular franchise but with a woman as the lead. Your killing us with your creativity hollywood
This film made my life hell.My name is Damien and the amount of times people tried looking for 666 on my head.
The song / music is top class amazing.
finally a more creative movie trailer that doesn't give the movie away. and using the music of fever ray from vikings makes it slap so hard. actually excited to see this!
A voz da Maria José invertida no final kkk
so Servant season 5?
I´ve heart the music and was waiting for Ragnar to show up..
The twist is that Nell tiger free will be the demon the whole time, she will never give birth to a Damien. Hence why you never see her pregnant here. No one will see the demon child as a girl cuz it was a boy in the original. Everyone thinks nell will be the vessel for the devil but she will actually be the devil.
The orginal begins with Damien's birth. That's LITERALLY his origin. You can't go back any further. Is it going to be the quest of Satan's sperm up a jackal's uterine canal?
They really shouldn't have used the Vikings theme.
The fact that Disney bought 20th Century Fox, now 20th Century Studios, back in 2017, This Prequel to the Omen is literally a Disney Movie!
✝️
Anyone know what was said in reverse at the end of the trailer?
Song???
The trailers always look way better than the movie; then you watch the  movie and it’s TRASH.
Gentlemen, He's Back
Love this track. But it's wrong for this movie. Use the original omen score
Not gonna lie...that trailer slaps hard. At first, I was groaning at the idea of an Omen prequel, but with the Fever Ray music and the visuals I'm sold
If only they knew these kind of trailers are more effective than the regular boring ones with the inception BROOOOOOOMMM sound effect.
*Dope trailer, I must say.*
Came for The Omen, now id rather watch the saga of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Didnt really show anything interesting, is this connected to original or 06
If you watch the trailer in reverse….it seems to be the main girl going from dark and corrupted, to being a child and innocent! Interesting!
What incredible trailer.
But Damien was born of the devil and a jackal? He’s not human! How are they going to explain it?
Nell was amazing to watch in the show Servant, hope this movie goes well.
Just...wow. Don't care if it's a prequel that nobody seemed to ask - looks chilling and promising!
This is a surprisingly subdued trailer, and I like it.
Fantastic editing on this trailer, I like the meaningful use of reverse as if it's rewinding to where the story would begin as an Omen origin story 👌
Now that’s how you do a trailer!
New year new batch of shitty movies I won't watch
Not enough Damien so it’s a no for me
Uuuuh... What is this? Tell me more.
what can i say. When i heard about this film i didn't would have give to it a penny, but now i that i see this you've take a little bit of my curiosity. i'm look forward to it.
Vikings opening song, literal chills
Interesting 💀🔥
A Leanne indo aterrorizar outra linha do tempo 😊
I love this song but it's a complete mismatch for the trailer.
Leanne?!
She is from the show called Servant, right?
Why do I feel that the person who made this trailer was a fan of Nolan's movies ?!
I can imagine that the next teaser will be the same as this one,but played forward instead of reversed
Why is everything playing reverse? Is that supposed to happen?
Great teaser
Her Mother Was A Jackal 🐺 👿
Vikings intro song.. but why?! It will always be that for me, so its weird here...
The song playing,  is the same song that is playing when Jessie is going crazy in Breaking Bad  ... riding the go kart and screaming
It's giving me the same anxiety and nausea I got from watching Irreversible...
“If I Had a Heart” by Fever Ray. That´s the name of the song
Vikingssssss
"his mother was a jackyl"
awesome!
Wow ❤
The knife 😮
I'm in shock, the trailer didn't end with someone getting dragged off-screen.
It is more a teaser than actually a trailer 🤔
I don't even know wth this is about? It looks like a Demonic 50 Shades of Grey horror film.
Didn't we already hear that song in Viking?
Looks terrible
For those who knows this, thr is the reverse thing supposed to mean anything?
Oh look. The first horror movie L of the year. Fox has really fallen off after being bought by Disney. Avatar & Free Guy are definitely their only Ws
Well, they went ahead and made a genuinely interesting trailer for a movie nobody asked for. Good strategy. I'm curious
Ralph Ineson is far too tall to be playing Patrick Troughton!
This looks intense and very very scary i can't wait to see it 😊❤
Is this yet another knock off of the 1976 movie The Omen?
his mother was a jackal....
As a core fan of original trilogy (well, the first 2), I am worried already about this prequel. I am more team Omen than team Exorcist.  I hope it won't ruin the 70s legacy like all the other remakes, reboots, sequels/prequels do these days....
First i saw the original when i was 12 or 13. It really effected me like no other horror movie.
No way they used the vikings theme song .....
the trailer looks lazy and rushed. Im pretty sure the movie is the same way.
What’s the name of the song in the teaser? Thanks.
I'm looking forward to see this movie coming out in 3 months. Really exciting to see the First Omen, the prequel to the 1976 horror classic. The reverse message saying "look at me, Damien, its all for you" is totally spooky and haunting. Got them echoes bursting in my ears seeing this trailer and I'm very intereting to watch this in theatres.
fever ray <3
Hmmmm. I don't know
All this trailer did was make me wanna watch Vikings again
Will flop.
The Mouth Of Devil Mark
Now I want Paramount to release Apartment 7A (Rosemary’s Baby prequel) on the same day
Wasn't worth the wait
<Vikings intro>
After 48 years..now release prequel from The Omen..
This is going to be very scary for me put I am down to seeing this masterpiece.
This is a cool teaser
good teaser, lets hope this follows through win it
Any omen fans? 666
❤
The first omen is 4th omen franchise and Omen 4: The First Omen prequel i can wait til cinema and make me best scariest ever.
Super weak trailer, in my opinion. It's basically just creepy music.
This Omen movie Ain't Scariest its drama
Gonna explain how damien is born
I like how that that we’re going for the show but don’t tell teaser on this movie since it looks surprisingly promising
Vikings ! Might gk back and watch it...i have bad omens for this 1
I’m getting vibes the prequel is taking place before/between omen4: awakening
Dark x goth vibes
It's got the Vikings opening song.
Need aspect ratio 2.39 : 1
Reminds of when the purge did the “first purge” title & people were confusing the title with the first movie in the purge franchise. Just like Halloween (the original), Halloween (2007 remake) & Halloween (2018 requel) I just know that this will get people upset tryin* to distinguish to 2 title of the original The Omen movie, the remake of the omen & then “the first omen”
This does not feel like The Omen
Fever Ray in a movie trailer? I’M SOLD 😮‍💨
Is this based off The Omen?
Song from Fever Ray in the trailer. Nice
Gabriel from Malignant approves of this trailer!
0:59 “Look at me Damian! It’s all for you!” in reverse
April 5th will be The Super Mario Bros Movie 1st anniversary
