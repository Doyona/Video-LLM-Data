Great couple of Tests to start the year! England head to India next! What are your predictions? 🏏
It sounds surreal not to hear the crowds, it makes it sound like a local village match.
An absolute spinfest
was it just spin
Crawley is not a opener!!  Plays best at number 3
Grand, though Sri Lanka can be an attractive side to watch.  Subbed.
Embuldenya gets wickets, but goes for runs
I always find that Joe root is such a underrated bowler and the two wickets he got showed he can get wickets
Get ready lads for ashwin
As a Sri Lankan, I'm quite glad to have the British passport right about NOW.
Bad umpiring
Gone are the days when the Sri Lankan Test  bowling attack from Murali, Vass and Herath crippled the opposing batsmen, this Sri Lankan cricket team is playing like amateurs compared to 1995 to 2015 Sri Lankan squad, 25 years of Sri Lankan cricket glory has ended, hopefully not for good.
Rooting good win
6:35 They've figured out a way of sparing us the sight of Mickey Arthur's short shorts
7:02 Aiyo 😂
I wish they would put slow mo replays ..
Sky please please please can we get replays going forward. I don't see the point of highlights otherwise.
Watch Al Jazeera document ary on cricket 4:53 will make you very suspicious please listen to me some1
I reckon Jimmy Anderson is the England player with the most Not outs to his name - pure class, oh and a pretty good bowler to boot😛
ay yore
In the words of the Sri Lankan wicket keeper every other over, ‘good bowling embuldeniya’
Awful batting and poor captaincy by Sri Lanka today. Bess and Leach will not be very successful in India because they are up against test class batsmen who will not get out like the blokes today did.
why are we only seeing the wicket takes once?! no replays at all...dont like the editing
Well played everyone !
Whilst winning is good for confidence we'll have to improve hugely before we play the cheats down under next winter
Will the India test be on sky ??
As someone who has semi-recently started following cricket pretty obsessively... its pretty difficult to actually watch! most of the games aren't even televised in the UK and the highlights packages on offer are very short or non existent. It's incredibly hard to get a feel for how the teams are actually playing. Compared to other sports this is very lacking. Live coverage is great when you can catch it but if you can't then you lose out. Sort it out! BBC needs to get it all back!
I’m a Pakistan fan here and I think/hope that eng win against India
We'll done England 🇬🇧
Very sad to see the state of the SL team.  YouTube keep suggesting me highlights of legendary SL players just to pile on the sadness.   Sangakkara, Mahela, Marvan, Aravinda, Jayasuriya, Vass, Kaluwitarana...... Amazing players.
Would it be possible to include replays of dismissals please ?
Srilanka got corona virus
Siraj and Washington, waiting for leach
Well done everyone especially as we skittled them out cheaply. Seems like the pitch suited our spinners.
Stop putting spoilers in the video title. Some of us would like to watch the test match in highlight form over 5 evenings, and we really don't want to know the result before starting the highlights. I don't care if your data analytics department has told you to include more clickbait or some crap like that - couldn't you just say "2nd Test, Day 4 Highlights"? Your current approach would be like titling a movie: "Voldemort dies| Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". Please, no spoilers.
Pleased for Sibley ! Hes been short of runs this series and against Pakistan . Hes a good guy - glad to see him get runs which ensures he stays in the side.
Got to say England are a top side in all 3 formats now.  It's the first time they are going to a series in India and you can't rule them out from nicking the series.
My god, they didn’t show bairstows slog swept six where it landed, it fell into a bucket of white paint lol, ball had to be changed.
Can Andrew Struass or any ECB moron explain how we are more or less in total lockdown yet these overpaid sportsman can fly half way round the world?!
REPLAYS REPLAYS REPLAYS PLEASE - worst company for highlights EVVA
Highlight for me is Anderson’s catch. Phenomenal.
I would love some replays of the wickets!!
to all the mugs on here wondering why they do'nt show this or that. the idea is you subscribe to the evil murdochs networks. ..wise up, will ya.
Yet another abysmal show by SL. They don’t know how to play test cricket and don’t have what it takes really. Not world class bowling by England and most wickets were just gifted. Unbelievable. SL 11 is just a bunch of jokers.
As impressive as they can be, Crawley and Sibley are really not playing spin at the moment. Crawley gone the same way again, it's gonna need to be better for India.
God bless you guys. n bless Great Britain.
When England need someone to bat and just steady the ship, always seems to be Buttler atm, did it against Pakistan too!
Very soft wickets SL
Well played England.
Why do cricketers giggle like teenagers these days when they take a wicket? 🙄
England will beat India 4:0 and play world test championship
Does anyone remember the grief that Somerset got for having those spin friendly pitches at Taunton? It doesn't seem like a bad idea now from England's perspective.
Yeah the only srilankan player and Bess is a find
Show more replays off key moments like wickets, or a extended highlights video thats like 20 mins, be so much better
What is the theme at the very start called? Haven't seen an answer anywhere.
No Anderson reverse sweep, no replays, Sky really don't know how to make test match highlights.
Finally, England's spinners doing something
Well done England..👍🏻👍🏻Come on SL,Indians with youngsters  defended the mighty Aussie onslaught and won...😢😢
How are Sky Sports Football highlights so good yet Sky Sports Cricket highlights so bad. You'd think catches might merit a highlight from a slightly different angle.
Even with this SL demolition job, India is going to complete maul this English team. Apart from Root the rest of batting didn't do as well - 50s wont win you games in Aus, SA, Ind, and NZ. Anderson and spinners were gifted wickets. India at home are a juggernaut, and coupled with momentum of an away series against the Australia, it'll be tough task for England to avoid a 3-0 or 4-0 loss. Pak vs SA will be a lot closer of a test series than Ind vs Eng.
Please can you show the replays of wickets?
Leach got 1(17) but this time it was out 😂
Come on England this is a big game and it is gonna be a nail bitting end
"England will need 163" 🤔
Can I just ask...what’s wrong with our openers? they couldn’t open a can at the moment
Love the Butler Drives.
Really poor batting from Sri Lanka.
very good inning by Srilanka.                          i meant first.!
Embarrassing
Well done England. Amazing Root. Amazing Anderson and a great performance by England playing away from home.Sri Lanka though are a disgrace. It’s not about the lack of skill but it’s about lacking the heart, the will and pride representing your country. Shameless arrogant  bunch!
Extraordinary performance by England.  Congratulations..!!!
All ten first innings wickets fell to pace, all second to spin. Has this happened before?
So many catches off deflections in this game/series.
TOP CLASS TEAM TOP CLASS PERFORMANCE we got ability to change the the game in minutes CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND love from 🇬🇧🇵🇰
Imagine the scenes if Rooty bagged a hat trick
Sri Lanka does not understand home side advantage it seems. There own players are struggling against spinner
Sri Lanka are making England look good wait till they get to India that will sort the men from the boys.
Good job England 👍
Sri Lanka batsmen showing all the composure of a 1990s England side!   Good solid display in both tests by England, yes SL are clearly a weak side at the moment but you can only beat what is in front of you. New Zealand didn’t win here against many of the same players.
Where’s all the comments criticising Bess and Leach gone?
The only good thing to come out of this series for SL is Embuldeniya. Poor guy had no support from the rest of the team
Good win for england but credit to Lasith Embuldeniya.
Will Sky be showing the England vs India series?
Embrassing from SL.
People gassing about England but this is the worst Sri Lanka team in 30 years. If people think they're beating India they are deluded
any danger of showing some replays for any of these catches?
Quality of SL cricket team has dropped sharply. You can see they don't believe in themselves in the false strut, gait and puffed chests.
India squad - Burns in for Crawley, pope in for Lawrence, stokes in for Curran, broad in for wood, archer in for leach/Bess
You didn't show Jimmy's textbook reverse sweep? Absolute travesty
And people call test match cricket boring
Buttler the steady finisher once more.
Despite the poor performance from SL I think Embuldeniya was by far the best player of that match
Well done to sibley for working really hard on improving against spin 👏
How did England win in 4 days
Not showing Anderson’s reverse sweep should be criminal
Good to see the spin twins get so many wickets today. They'll have bowl like that in every innings against India though.
Great win by England  a good fight by Sri Lanka
First
