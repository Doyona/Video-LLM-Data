Love these two!
Natural talent vs a learned skill
The trajectory trail when he threw the putter 💀💀💀
فيكتور اشتغل فيترجي
روري يخبلللللل🫷😭😭😭
Is that Viktor guy a pro golfer?
That 3 iron tee shot from Rory is just pure skill and talent. Ridiculous shot!
Wow Rory really flexed his creativity.

I’m officially a Victor Hovland fan now… Rory’s three iron was insane
the tracer on the putter 😂
God*
So many Scandinavians not only speak perfect English, but with a dead-on (or very close) American accent.
Pro golfers: having 18 clubs in their bags Me: having less than 10 clubs in my bag…
Hovland is the Norwegian Mcilroy.
4:57
4:58
8 years more experiences than you, youngsters. seems like rory get insulted ahahaha
Rory pitching a 7 iron 150 onto the green made my golf balls shrink.
Love the club toss being traced!
Nice
Taylor made on top of ping
6:25 Hovland so real for this 😂😂🤣🤣
You would never guess Viktor was from Norway lol
Tampak cerdas,sehat,bahagia,semoga selamat,salam salam
They should've got Jamie Sadlowski there to show them how to hit easy approach shots with a putter haha
We all knew Rory was down-to-earth, but I’ve never seen this side of Hovland before. How can you not root for both of these guys?
'How to Succeed at Golf When You're Fully Baked', by Viktor Hovland
If I was Viktor, I would've played the same club as Rory every time except with 2 clubs left, and just left it to chance at that point.
Cool of hovland to He’s no very creative … he’s a ball striking savant , he’ll hit his number 9/10 .. make sense tho , up until recently his short game was severely hindering him from being a genuine world number 1 contender … and when you think of the best short game players it’s the creative ones , seve,Sergio,phill,speith all great wedge players … and all also likely to hit a chippy 6 iron 165 yards under the wind to a back pin ….whereas Hovland wold fire right at the pin with his 9/8 iron
I love these two. 😂 And, Nice job, Viktor! FedEx Champ 2023. 🏆
That 3 iron flopshot was not only insanely dirty it was closest to the pin??? Rory is a shot maker and makes it look effortless
McIlroy is such a competitor. You could feel his dissapointment when he rolled off with the driver shot.
Well hovland is way better than him 🤣🤣🤣
My two favorite players❤
I need a friend like Hovland. 🎉🎉
Two young players having fun. Laughing a lot, why don’t PGA tour players try this challenge.
Vik = not a Karen. You know the rest......
Awesome two guys. More of them please
Rory is so good. Variety of shots.
Masters 2023 definitely power swap lol
the putter throw went straighter than that last shot
I knew Rory had a great personality but knew little to nothing about Viktor.... he came across as a genuine great guy. That was entertaining.
Viktor man so mean
Viktor sounds like he should just be playin Sunday with the boys😂😂
Gotta love Rory " That was a very poor shot to be fair " 🤣😂
Never heard Rory have a voice crack.  ''Stay on the greehhn!'' - Rory Mcilroy 2022
Viktor taking the lords name in vain multiple times. Sad
The amount of dodgy accents those American college golf scholarships create is frightening. Viktor is up there with the legends of the genre, we're talking GMac level! Wouldn't hold it against him though, at least English is his second language, unlike gmac and also seems like a very nice guy.
There’s me stepping on an 8 iron to get it there and Rory doing what looks like a 60yard chip with one. They really are playing a different game
Rory's 3 iron shot 😮
How the hell do a Norwegian and Northern Irish guy have the exact same accent!
Viktor was SO bad at this hahahah
i seriously can't believe Victor was so bad... Maybe, when I was young I should have not played creative shots in local park (deep trees). I can't believe I'd beat Victor in this challenge- yet lose by 10 shots on course ..
Rorys 3 iron unreal
I didn't expect Victor to sound like he's from Arizona.
Hovland has a US southern accent and it’s hilarious
Just to save you time, Cam Smith won.
Rory second club was L wedge, mans must of forgot that the sand wedge existed.
And to think, they’re playing in the final grouping for the open tomorrow!
This duo aged well
Foreshadowing tmr?
And here the two of them are final pairing shooting it out for the claret jug 💪💪
who’s here after the open? :)
1:08 the view of the city is just gorgeous!
are we not gonna talk about how many shots Rory was taking at Viktor? Bro was straight up bullying him haha. gotta love it.
After this Hovland has started to play really bad. Lost all of his confidence here obviously 😂 He rarely misses the cut but managed to make 9 bogeys in 11 holes at the US open. What has happened to him 😖
The teed up 3-iron slice/flop was fantastic. Even Viktor is like "this dude is so much more talented than me."
These two guys are so cool and fun to watch!
Rory, I saw that coin flip mate. How long you been practicing that?
have no idea why these guys weren't a ryder cup pairing
Hovland needs to pick up a sun screen endorsement, he's lookin like a lobster out there.
4:47 I don't know if i'm just seein things but that looks like a wedge rather than a 5 iron
damn, that putter throw was really good after he hit the ball
Nice to see 2 professional guys in sport having fun and banter with each other as opposed to slagging each other off well done guys great to see 👀
Narcissist 😂
Rory is always such a good sport in these videos.
That 3 iron was ridiculous
Rory is usually pretty humble but he’s came off a bit prickish to me here 🤷🏻‍♂️
What kind is Rorys wrist band??
This just shows how good rory is. Just needs to sort out the bit between the ears when it comes to competing
Thanks for the donation Victor. Lol. What a good sport. Too funny.
The ball tracker on the putter 🤣🤣🤣
Its so weird to hear Rory beginning to Call people youngster. I feel so weird about that. Maybe it’s just me idk.
FEI ECONOMY
I remember Graeme McDowell talking about how insanely good Rory was when playing in tournaments and what even more insanely he was able to pull off when practising - I guess we can get a glimpse of that in this video.
Hovland out here looking like Rory's little brother that smokes too much weed 😂
"Is your name on the tee...?" "Yeah" proceeds to toss it away in disgust haha great stuff as usual from the European tour
Rory stop doing this crap and concentrate on yo ur golf. 8 years without a major.
Brilliant video. The skillset of Rory is ridiculous. Even a fellow tour pro just looking at that 3 iron shot and thinking how did he do that shows you how special he is.
Hovland so much cooler
Next episode is Dechambeau v Reed. It's 1 and a half hours long and Reed takes 14 shots.
Hovland`s accent sounds like the legendary old time american actor whose name escapes me.
Hovland got sweet revenge by winning the tournament! Rory's 3 iron and lob wedge shots were disgustingly good. Seve used to flop 3 irons out of bunkers, different level of talent!!
The shot trace on the putter throw 🤣
Rory finally getting a win
素晴らしいですね。
i think you should also be awarded 1 point for closest to pin in this game mode. love these vids!
It's okay Viktor. You won the tournament 😄
It’s nice to see them carrying their own bags.
Hovland was born in Norway and speaks better English than I do lmao
I wanna see Hovland and Hatton do this challenge... would be too damn funny.
Absolutely love this pair, quality.
That flop 3 iron was impressive AF.
Rory is a different level. He'll come back 😎
This might be one of my favorite editions of this challenge, this video made me a Hovland fan too! The banter and trash talking between these 2, it's amazing Also shot tracer on the putter? LMAO
The fact hovland won the event makes this even funnier😂
Christ Rory's getting boring!
So mcilroy does have loads of different shots....
That 3 iron cut shows the God that Rory is!!!
On  Learning Golf, by Percy Boomer  (1946): "Now each shot in golf is a separate situation, and when we contemplate a situation -- preparatory to playing the shot -- we have to sense through our carefully built-up sense of feel how much power we need.. there are many well-known and successful players who can play nothing but full shots...  The test of a golfer's control is in his ability to play a shot of 70 yards *with every iron club in his bag*." After seeing about six of the 14 club challenge videos, I was surprised at how few tour pros hit the green with an iron that was 2 clubs stronger than their preferred club-- e.g. with a 5 iron when their preferred club was a 7 iron. It was impressive that McIlroy chose a wedge for his first shot, and later hit the green with a 3 iron...  And Hovland won the tournament in a playoff after finishing birdie, eagle, birdie.  McIlroy finished third, one shot behind Hovland and Richard Bland. Hovland played the 4th hole in the tournament in par; McIlroy played it in -1.  I'd like to see Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy in this event.
This is the life!!!
Seems like Vik needs to learn some shots.  This was cool.
Boys need to tuck their shirts in 🤨
you could tell that narcissists comment got to him. the expression on his face read "ouch...but you might have a point there..."  That means theres hope for ya there Rory :)
you have 3 iron blades lol
Rory has his own name on his tees lmao
Hovland sounds exactly like Graeme McDowell
I love how Hovi chucks Rorys tee down with 'narcissist' 🤣🤣🤣  Great videos these, does show the creativity of players, Pepperell with his 6 aye Rors!
Rory is on another level to Hovland. Experience is key
DP world are a shower of scumbags.
Rory different level. Showing everyone how to do it
that 3 iron shot by Rory, wow
Never seen a putter shanked before Viktor 👏🤣🤣🤣
First thing we’ve seen Rory win for a while
2 great guys.....good luck to both of them
That was the best episode yet !!!! Such nice funny guys and two of my favorite tourplayers. Laughed my ass off when Victor threw the tee away : ) :) :) :) lol
love it! Rory definitely has a point when he says "Experience!", something Viktor is definitely going to get lots of in the coming years! which will be nice to follow :)
Hovland sounds more like McDowell than McIlroy does
What’s that Viktor’s game putter he threw down fairway? 😄
Rory seems like the type who wouldn't take losing as well as Viktor did here.
I really love Rory’s swing and his attitude on games for long times watching. Now, Viktor is the second man I always follow his tournament
Not the tracer on the putter throw 💀
So Hovland is American? He maybe spent a week in Norway. He a typical yank now.
Hovland sounds more like an American than most Americans. If I didn't already know he was Norwegian I'd swear he was from the USA.
For people who follow golf closely, do the pros do many videos like this? Are there pros that create regular YT content on their own channels?
I think Viktor needs more sun cream.
Wanna see vids like this on pga tour channel
Got to love that tracer line following the putter 🤣
Hahha the most entertaining 14 club challenge ever
I seriously hope they play pairs in next Ryder cup.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that 3 iron WOW!!!
Rory content!
Narcissist! 😂
We all knew Rory was down-to-earth, but I’ve never seen this side of Hovland before. How can you not root for both of these guys?
It's pretty obvious hovland never had to play with a mixed set of ladies, junior & broken man's hand me down clubs
would love to see TW do this during the week of the British
Omg amazing
The links golf is an advantage, no wonder Rory got him 😂
has it got your name on it? 😂
Love it, great fun
That 3 iron shot from Rory was unbelievable
The people we wanted in one video ? Couldn’t do better
rory won the 14 club challenge but hovland won the whole tournament
Rory hitting a pitching wedge like I hit my 7 iron
🤩😂🤣😂🤣
Welp hovland will never win the masters
Need Rob Rock doing this now it's his last year on tour.... Legend
Love Rory changing accent depending on who he's speaking to
The next addition happily disappear because pull mainly decide circa a helpless dogsled. tight, beautiful side
Hahaha kinda funny that Vic ended up being the one to beat Rory after this 😂
Rory vs high Rory
Now that was a lot of fun!  Two great guys, two outstanding golfers. It's impossible to not like or cheer for either.
Genuinely wondering, how long has Viktor lived in the US? He’s Norwegian but seems to have almost no accent in my opinion. Compared to his European peers on the pga tour I can notice their accents almost every time but at first glance I would’ve taken Viktor for USA born and raised lol
I would have landed on the green with the putter and driver, and missed it with every other club in the bag. 🤪
Sneaking suspicion Rory might be the most competitive bloke in human history 😂
Definitely two of my favorites. Would love to play a round the golf with these guys.
Interesting how much more creative Rory is - is that a generational thing or did Viktor not have enough time on a course where he was bored and invented games?
Best one yet!
Opened up 3 iron slice to the center of the green is sick
I love this. I think that's an Oklahoma accent from Victor
Rory is a straight SAVAGE!!!
Absolutely brutal banter between these two, that was hilarious! And holy hell Rors, that 3i was magic.
Had to come check this out immediately. Definitely two guys that move the needle and are extremely likable
the throw tracer got me
Rory pulled out Dat 3-iron showing who is daddy.
Wow this is actually the funniest episode
Economy Class vs Norwegian Air
Rory’s three iron was so good
One of my favorite series on YouTube, combined with 2 of my favorite players! This is gonna be good!!!
Victor needs some new head covers🤣🤣🤣
Rory is my guy but Viktor is an awesome guy
so from augusta to dubai, guys must be knackered from travelling xD
This is priceless ! Rory's flop shot 3 iron was nuts, driver tee height...
Jesus I want to play that course
ahahaha when he threw the personalized tee in disgust
So much talent If only Rory could put 4 good rounds together
Rory was simply showing him what he needs to aiming for. The confidence levels between the two is chalk and cheese.
How good is Rory! Insane!
two of the most fun guys on tour. hard not to root for both of them
Ohhhh YES!!!!! Love the 14-club challenges. I didn't think they were ever gonna come back. Thank you sooooo much.
Gotta appreciate the tracer on the flying putter
glad to see such content
The putter throw shot tracer was funny as hell
So ironic after the results of this tournament
Rory was always gonna ace this challenge , he has all the shots in the bag.
atleast VIktor won the tournament
That was classic. Rory using hid superior sledging skills and a ridiculous 3 iron to crush poor young Victor's spirit.
Fabulous fun, thanks
Hovland is a great guy
This is the content I didn’t know I needed today! Thank you
Great video, but someone needs to get Viktor some sunscreen jeez.
Brilliant
Good video, two of my favourite players, Rory digging it into Viktor, he is very very competitive. The Old Dog putting the Young Dog in his place. What a final round at the Masters from Rory, come on mate a few more Majors please. And I believe in the future Viktor will have some Great Victories under his belt, he is a future Hall of Famer.
They need a late night TV show.
Two of my favorites right here.
Yeah, that 3 iron was absolutely disgusting. Somehow, Rory made that work. No wonder he's one of the best golfers.
This is funny... Since we all know the results of the tournament were Rory choked and Viktor came from the clouds to win lol
That shot was like a slow death 😆 classic Rorz
These two put on such a show! We need more of these guys together!!
Great video! Awesome shots by Rory. Viktor got revenge by winning the actual tournament.
Best one
Gotta love viktor always is smiling never see him not smiling favorite player on tour by far
Crazy how soft Rory swings a 7 and it goes 150+, I know tons of guys who gotta mash it to get that far!
I love how competitive these fellers are. I'd watch them race to press buttons on the elevator.
And Viktor took that personally
Sooooo I scored as many as Viktor....I'll be telling the grandkids 😂
Great pairing!
Tracer on the putter throw. If we had that imaging how much footage we’d have of Tyrell 😂😂😂
Looking like a couple of hackers!
Fascinating game, some amateurs (ahem) could do better at.
my two absolute favorite golfers out there. seeing these two enjoy interacting with each other was definitely a dream come true for me. quality players and totally quality dudes. great video!  yeah, Rory’s 3 iron shot was sick as helllll.
Hovland got sweet revenge by winning the tournament! Rory's 3 iron and lob wedge shots were disgustingly good. Seve used to flop 3 irons out of bunkers, different level of talent!!
Who knew Rory was a world class chirper? Good for him!
I’d just need Tiger to join them and I’d have all of my favorites
Rory and stoned Rory
That 3 iron was nasty
Great video.  Keep them coming
I was in a bad mood but you had me laughing out loud Thanks guys
That was great craic, Rory is some shite talker🤣🤣🤣
Love your vids, keep it up
Rory.... what a joker..... sorry i ment choker
Two of the most likable gents on tour. So easy to root for both of them. Best of luck for the rest of the season!
Great
Ohh to be young 😅😅😅 and him barely 30 ffs!
The putter tracer!! Lmaooo
It goes without saying, but McIlroy is honestly ridiculously talented
Wow. Rory can trash talk?
Rorys 3 iron unbelievable very creative
How bout you go putt those balls rory....
That was....a total blow out 😄
Rory was soo close to the record!!
Love that they’re talking a little smack. I wanna see more of that!
Best one yet
I now want a tracer for every golfclub getting thrown in frustration during tournaments, please make it happen xD
Rory bit of tit
that 3 iron, nuts.
Need more of rors and hov
fav pairing yet. cheers!
Two of the coolest cats in golf..
Love these guys
Yep, Hovland did little bit better in the tournament :)
Hovland won the tournament 🤣🤣
yeeeah
