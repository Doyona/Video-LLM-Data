Say you start with 500 dollars and you take ou that loan of 100 then you spend that 100 on safe parking then you have to pay the bank back plus the itrest so you end up paying more.
Leave it at your mansion...
"I would Like To use my Lambo For Colaateral" "Ok Sir We Will Take Your Car If You Can't Pay back in future Thank you"

Someone this rich would 1. Have a massive place to park  2. Be able to pay for valet parking

Garages exist.
If he has a Lambo he can easily pay for parking
Dam that's am actual big brain momment
Its already Overused
If he can afford a lambo, then why didn't he had a garage?
Yea but taking out a loan often reduces your credit score.
And why not just take out $120?

Yea no that's very smart using it for collateral when you're out of town but if you can afford a lambo why can't you afford a house with a garage? It's for free. 🤨
Lazy lip-synch AND a trash ending? Wish I could get my time back
Is this cancer?
Wait can you actually do this?
Uhm no it's NOT
Like I haven’t heard this one before
Copied
Smh…….stop biting
hi
It is time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible
That's not your joke bro
This story has been around forever.
20% interest rate ah yes
Instructions were not clear now have autism
the world war 3 has started!!! Russia bombs nuclear station in Ukraine!!! it is the biggest catastrophy in the world!!! STOP PUTIN!!! SUPPORT UKRAINE!!!
this is for children, right?
This is like parking in Makiki it's at a premium
nice only seen this video about 5 other times
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
BOWBOW💯🔥💯😂😭😭
should credit when you use other peoples content
Not how it works whatsoever.
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Hey! Jesus loves you! God Bless! https://youtu.be/eqkOqz3vGyc
"Watch till the end... it’s worth it !!" narrator: it wasn't
i was just thinking about this old story today

I'd like to use my child for collateral. Free daycare for him.
Is this the same one where he gets free parking smh
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God..  Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.................................
She speaking facts
Thief
i forgot which youtuber these were from
This joke was originally a blonde joke, I liked it better that way tbh (like the story is the same, but its about a blonde woman instead, breaking the "blonde women in jokes are stupid" stereotype)
Queen of pawn baby!

Man took valet parking to another level
Why does he not have a garage
Bro you stole this from Mark Tilbury, at least credit him
Nice
20% interest rate for a loan? Goddamn.
Cheaper than leaving it at home
this is stolen from another shorts youtuber that has real experience
Nice stolen content
Yes, my man knows the tricks
There are much better versions of this joke out there.
This is a smart one rare among his kind
Okay but collateral doesn't work like that
You remind me of someone, it’s either the kid who played the guy in descendants or someone from jurrasic world fallen kingdom…
And thus the “Garage” was born
Bruh stop ripping people off if you are just do the original audio and then the original person gets credit at least but don’t be trash 🗑 bruh 😎
Ah yes, stolen from Mark Tilbury https://youtube.com/shorts/f2H1FPg5rDA?feature=share
Omg lol
Dam i could just leave a car at my house and it will be free
Thats genius
Stolen idea for tik tok...
Stolen content, nice
This is real story of Indian business tycoon Vijay Malya in New-York....
Nice, u stole someone else’s tiktok without giving credit, this is tiktok for ya
Already seen 15 other people make this
There was literally a joke like this when I was a kid and I was told it was a smart blonde joke
Dude im sorry but can you stoo copying ppl
Bro which bank has interest rate of 20%
Smart guy
All your videos are stolen
Yes
This whole channel is copied
he just stole this entire video idea from someone else and recreated it in a shittier way
You stole this skit from someone else
Nice copy…. What’s up with you guys totally biting other creators content..  Here a brilliant idea for ya make YOUR OWN CONTENT!!!!!
"i would like to use my child for collateral" Free daycare
Has a car worth hundreds of thousands of dollars but doesn’t have a garage or driveway to store it
Stop copying peoples conteny
swear if yu have a lambo yu prob have a house with a garage
Tell me you don’t own a lambo without telling me you don’t own a lambo
Copied the other guts video completely
Actually make something original and don’t use someone else’s content. My respect has gone down for u.
*dude mouthing * mom in the background 👀
Stolen
Pov: your car doesnt start anymore
Stolen concept
Recycling content..
Home ?
Banks are not stupid 😂😂😂 before giving any loans they do checks over checks to calculate profit. Where as keeping and maintaining lambo will be obviously cost more than 20$. So they will reject it 😂😂😂
Copied, but I like seeing it the second time with your awkward self instead
This guy just copies content
how did he get home
It's called having a house with a garage. If you have a lambo but not a security system with a garage. Don't buy a lambo
Second stolen vid I’ve seen from this channel 😂😂😂
I didn’t really understand stand but just a little I have to watch it again lol
Stolen video
😂
This is the 10th person I’ve seen do this exact skit and it was by far the worst.
Pretty sure there's a minimum of how much a loan can be
I would like to assume that if he had a lambo then he had a parking garage that is free
You litterally just called yourself out as a copycat 💀
Dude has a Lamborghini but not a house?
same joke
Lmao that's using his noodle
That's not how collateral works though...
Stolen
Bruh stop taking ither peoples confidence
Why is this replicated so much?
I wonder if I’ve heard this before somewhere else on YouTube shorts?
They gonna sell you some credit card instead of giving u loan, meh 😐 😑 😕 😒
You own a lambo and yu give a damn about 20 bucks, get real man
Now how collateral works. Not how interest works. Not how any of it works.
Tht was smart
I like how you just copied that old dudes video. YouTube needs to cut down on this overplayed crap
That genuis
He didn’t steal this from another creator.  This story has been around forever. The story goes the guy didn’t want to pay over $1000 a month for parking in NYC so he went to the bank next door to the parking garage and did this. Btw the car was a Ferrari.
Stolen content
20% interest rate ah yes
Make an original video
“I would like to use my lambo as collateral” “Sir… I don’t think we can do that… this is a bank not a garage…”
COPIED
You unoriginal sack of wine , stop copying the minds of others , doesn’t matter if it’s legal , it’s wrong , don’t be wrong.
Why tell the banker that?????
Me being 13 not knowing anything about this: 💀
20% interest rate. Pretty real
Ya, and that Lamborghini was deffinatly not used as a f-shack by dirty Mike and the boys while it was parked out back.
Man just stole from mark tilburys content🤣🤣
Stolen...
Any time a video says watch till the end...I skip
Oh my
This wasn't worth anything..
The thing is. When you get a loan and use collateral. The individual gets to KEEP the item unless they fail in making payments. Example: People can use the house they LIVE IN for collateral.
WTF 20% of interest rate, that is such a scam omg
This won’t work, they take collateral if you don’t pay it off when due.
That was not worth it!
You didnt make this originally
Stole this from another creator  Stole this from another creator  Stole this from another creator
if u got a lambo and don't have a safe garage in your house dont even buy it in the first place.
People do this with instruments and jewelry sometimes with pawn shops.
you stole this and his is better than yours
Wow this is original
I Heard this joke
me : parks on sidewalk
Like he could not park in his garage
The bank: has no words  The guy: 😎
Bruh just park at ur house
