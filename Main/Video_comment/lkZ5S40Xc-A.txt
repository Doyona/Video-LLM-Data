27:45 Brian “Homies” 😂😂
These press conferences are getting more and more painful to watch😬
The way they absolutely rinsed that presenter at the start😂😭😭😭😭💀
do you see the dominance of Jake here it’s kind of like the way he dominated me in bed. - True Geordie
Uh uh Jimen, got the eyes😂
Where is true news?
Please bring true news back
BETTER SCIENCE made covid bearable
I really miss truenews
It’s the beady eyes
who here after the tattoo...
And now tyron is actually humiliating himself. All the mma casuals in the comments cant face the facts
The banter in this episode is off lads... Sorry to say but it's true
These two are massive 🔔 🔚 's
Is Geordie having a laugh. His tongue couldn't be any deeper up Jakes ass. Only showing Jakes side of it, none of TWs best bits. It's becoming a bit cringe and fanboy like..
Geordie and his bum friend made me cringe
"I'll be dancing while calling you all the N word... champion"  Brian's one liners got me every time like 😂 💀
Lol so it’s racist if Boris doesn’t condemn English fans for booing players for kneeling.
Holy this show has gone extremely down hill... I made it 26 minutes before waking up and finding another show.
These comments are gold haha! :'D
Let’s not be stupid mind Conor is actually the most overrated fighter ever
I'm loving the way Geordie got roasted in the comments. Even he has to admit they're funny.
Jake is gonna knock him out with a right hook in the 4-5 round
Laurence and geordie's egos have grown to the point wear they're unbearable to watch.
Medicine Square Garden
Embarrassing how far TG has fallen
Hes changed his race but I'm not sure why that's really any more mockable than changing your gender...
There is absolutely no way that Lake PauLL with his youtube boxing skills beats a killer like woodley...i swear if Lake wins this fight.....i ma never trust any of these youtube fight events again. all fixed
The fake Korean guy just Ali g x Luca magnota
Its very difficult to call you a casual when you disable comments on nearly every video
Tg needs to stop pretending he knows anything about boxing because he’s made a montage of him tapping a bag 😂
True Paul strikes again
Dingbat is Irish slang too
get rid of lawrence now. not funny anymore, overly sarcastic. sucks his own micro shaft. cba even wasting my time watching, but i can be arse highlighting how arrogant hes getting. natural idiot.
Can someone explain what's the difference between being transracial and transgender? You will say, he wasn't born in Korea, well transgender people weren't born as their gender. He doesn't know what it's like, he doesn't know the langauge - well, a woman that identifies as a man also doesn't know what it's like to be a man, how mans body feels and behaves. What's the difference, tell me please, because it seem completely analogical to me
the fact he said mcgregor has been copying jake is baffling geordie needs to stop licking jake up every chance he gets
McKenna is not a naturally funny guy. The sarcastic banter doesn’t come across well.
Get rid of Laurence, ego has got to him
I'm a hardcore jake paul fan but this comment section is elite laughing my ass off reading it before watching the vid
Please stop sucking the Logan's off 🤣 like I get it, but looks and sounds like ya on the take
I really like Brian however I think he’s got the BLM stuff completely wrong
Conor at the peak of his career was probably the greatest trash talker of all time mainly because everything he said as crazy as it sounded, happened inside the octagon, the main reason the UFC went skyrocket up. Now, the fact he's literally saying Conor is copying jake paul has to be one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.
why is he in love with jake
That joke at the beginning about the robot and Jake Paul’s tribute video to his trainer was savage. I laughted and then felt bad 😂😂
Forget the G.O.A.T. the G.W.O.A.T. we now the "QUOTE" of ring announcing 😂
I saw the comments and decided not to bother watching this video lol cant stand ass lickers, geordie tryna get a chance to be Jake's real life friend lol
i hate how everyone is bigging up a kid who wont fight a man hes height and weight or a pro boxer even and hus team paying opponents to take a fall so the jake hype train can carry on
Lol I haven't caught up to this guy's content in a while, but almost 2 years on and he's still a meme, just in a different context lmao😂
Gat Anthony on the pod
That title is giving me a seizure.
Jake: " coughs " Geordie : " he is a master at his work "
True Geordie is such a tool. Kissing Jakes ass every time lol
Geordie you are overthinking things, no need to pick apart everything Tyron says
“Conor is copying Jake” are you fuckin jokin🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cmon Geordie, grasping at baby hairs here
Lads great video and respect to JP for this
Jake Paul: *Sleeps* Brian: that is absolute genius-level energy conservation strategy from Jake there.
Comments are violating 💀
That "Korean" is such a wet wipe
Bruh post the podcast on Spotify:(
BLM and taking the knee is gesture politics. It’s run by hypocrites
“A used Bentley is like a beautiful woman” this might be one of the best metaphors I have ever heard 😂😂😂
jake paul is a product of favoritism and the algorithm.
He just said Conor copied Jake.
Jordi is gonna say " people in the comments don't understand"
I can't wait for one of these youtube tunred fighter dweebs watches what happens when you step in the ring with an actual fighter and they all sit themselves back to youtube and this travesty ends.
When Lawrence said ufc ultimate fighting champions he was thinking ultimate fighting cripples and decided not to say it and the pause made Geordie nervous
u guys taking the piss cuz they are explaining what jake is doing, you can see that Tyron is playing Jakes game because its happened b4
Jake paul : shoots up school  Brian : wow its really smart that he did that
Interesting how intense people are going in on this fake asian guy when he has literally the exact same arguments as the trans community.
did you not see the ground and pound?!?
Brian must be on the Jake Paul payroll !
Brian is surprisingly sharp in this video
Conor McGregor has been copying jake paul? No just no shut up
Everyone hating on Geordie but in reality he’s one of the few people who tells it how it is and calls out bullshit so stfu
"I'd punch them and tell them to stop killing kids abroad." --first time I've watched this channel...instant fan
No Conor is not copying jake Paul lmao
Jake Paul commits mass genocide  Brain- “you see I like that from jake it shows he’s got the right mindset to be a fighter”
I reject your reality and substitute my own adam savage
I find it hypocritical when you guys say MEN CAN BE WOMEN but then when a guy does this to himself to look Korean you mock, I have no respect for you both, but I disagree with both men are never women no matter how much you wish and this guy is British
used to be funny, now just a pair of bell ends
That Oli guy went from looking like the  woman shouting after her Parrot called Chanel to malfoy from Harry Potter
Aw mate u actual sook up jacks a$$
Korean is nationality or heriatge/ancestry
Oli london is a white english man who thinks you can look like a nationality bruhhhh
How do you look like a nationality bruh
Human with pink hair,, wth??
YALL SO MAD LMFAO
"this guy is the worst {american accent} moderator"
Tf is this comment section
UFC ultimate fighting......... Champion. That's definitely not what Lawrence was thinking tho he's just not daft enough to say it 🤘
1 min in n I already getting dissed 🤣🤣🤣
First video in a while I've had to turn off after a few minutes. The wankfest for Jake is cringe!
People forget Conor McGregor went into the rings with Floyd Mayweather, and did very good. If you watch the replays. Conor did very well
watching tyron coming up and going down.. he was good not great but at some point in his career a beast lived in him and after being on top for awhile he died and it's not coming back
Feels like Christmas. Love to see it!
These guys come across as so jealous to other peoples success especially on the YouTube front!!
5 tweets from inside the uk and over 1500 from the middle east... becarefull who you call racist.   Also the mural wasnt a racist comment.
Jake walks into a room - Brian “Ight where’s the lube”.
Jesus the comments are full of comedians, these Jake Paul Brian jokes are so not overused..
Tyron Woodley: Speaks Geordie: see he's fallen into Jakes trap now, the mental warfare is getting to him
Geordie comparing Jake to Conor constantly, Jakes 3-0 in boxing against a YouTube a boxer and a wrestler, Conor is the first ever two division champion in UFC history, he knocked out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds and he was undefeated for a fucking decade.. I used to think Geordies opinion meant something when it comes to the fight game but now he can fuck off licking Jakes arse for attention
I totally agree with the TG guys that identifying as something that you feel suits you more, regardless of what science says is ridiculous!
Geordie sold out for the entertainment and clout from Jake Paul, sad to see really never thought he would.
Hold on you said Connor mcgregor is copying jake ???? You can’t be serious Brian 11:00
True Geordie, what a 🔔🔚
23:56 yes, you are quite evidently confused XD
Jake Paul: *literally goes to jail*  Geordie: "see thats what I like about him he's smart he's playing with the cops head's"
I mean i dont see the difference between being transgender and transracial its the same thing they both think there something there not everything they made fun of him for is what everyone else makes fun of trans ppl for
Trump 2024 you commie nazis
Fook all the guys who are hating on TG...they just can't see Jake get credited for what he is doing...people forget that Jake in person and Jake as the internet guy and showman are completely two different persons and geordie knows it...so fook the haters
i'm korean but i got a tan and a fan of ksi so i'm british nigerian what a fucking joke hey like kpop then like kpop but don't say you are korean because you say you are. Happy you like our culture but i gladly don't except you to our race. you cant just white privilege into it
Can you really blame the bloke presenting for not sounding arsed about trying to get excited about a Jake Paul fight
You laugh at that korean guy now, the more people do it, the more accepted it will be.
You could call this racist but idk it is anyways I actually found out that black people are more athletic than a normal white guy/ women if ygm
So embarrassing watching a grown man fan boy over jake like this like fair enough respect the man but fuck me
Jake Paul > Than all of you tired, incels. Man is smoking the game.  Generally speaking, that's why all of y'all are here on True Geordies Podcast, which he is as well, smoking the game. Killing it.          Realizing his (their) dreams as y'all pay attention.    Difference is for what reason do you pay attention?   Look yourselves in the mirror, as I do.   Love the channel 👍
you bought a used Bentley is pretty funny
Geordie I luv you fam but you defend a man who beat a basketball player, a youtuber and a wrestler lol My guy wtf are you talking about. I know it helps to befriend Jake so you can get the views and the clicks but my guy you can't defend this man. I pray Tyron shuts him up and ends this whole stupidity.
These snowflakes in the comments saying Brian is sucking off Jake where Jake is just casually being confident which is the right attitude to stand out in a press conference he’s not just gonna sit there and offer Tyrone a cuddle of course he’s gonna go off on him and get under his skin the guys an asshole but he does make me laugh the guy knows how to talk other wise Tyrone wouldn’t fall into his game   Saying Brian is sucking off Jake is like saying everyone hates Joker because he does bad things while Batman is loved by all DC fans because he does good things when the reality is everyone likes a bit of edgyness it’s what makes us more open minded people and not pussies that just want to throw the toys out of the pram 😂😂
I thought it was Jake Paul but dude just jerks paul
This comment section is maddd fam💀😂
Tyron should have said "I don't want my name tattooed on you"
4:04 no no lawrence you gave too much personality there with that impression, more lifeless :P xxx
Gordie got the Rolex matching the Champion !  Swag damn
I love how Jake Paul has directly replaced McGregor for Geordie now 😂
It's great how these have made a career off copy and pasting the ricky Gervais xfm podcast minus Karl
They're saying this about nationality, but it's the same with gender. For example: Men are men and when they say they identify as women... they're still men. That's the reality of it. Facts verses feelings
If Jake Paul beats Woodley im asking Elon for a ticket to mars im out 😂😂
That reporter fucked Boris’s comments😂😂😂
Anyone know how much he spent on that plastic surgery???  Absolutely mental!
Tyron will run so scare . That his skink become white . Tyron your legs will shake because you never boxing .
stfu geordie
You have lost the plot you Geordie lad!
Geordie is fucking embarrassing himself!
Use give me a great laugh , cheers :)
Anyone else just cracking the fuck up at these comments? Hahaha
Brian went from McGregor lover jake paul hater   To a McGregor hater jake paul lover 😂 Edit : love Brian btw its just annoying when he sucks off jake talking about conor is coping jake paul like wtf ? 😂😂😂😂
*Jake Paul* : Loses  *Brian* : “You have to admire Jake for taking a dive and showing his support for the BLM movement by letting Tyron knock him out. This man is a modern day Ghandi.”
english football fans are delusional all the time worst fans on the planet no competition
The comments have me dying 🤣. Love and respect Bryan. ❤
Sorry idk if I’m Australian now cause I’ve  never heard anyone say dingbats
“It really doesn’t matter who’s had it first, it’s who has it now bitch” 😂😂
I get that Geordie is friends with the Paul brothers but he’s turned into a complete yesman
pause at exactly 0:01 , the way they're both looking at me is making me feel like I did something wrong lol like how my parents would look at me when I would get home from school after getting in trouble by my teacher 😂
wow... 2 videos in a month... imagine all the peeeeoooopleeee
The whole trans anything thing is just terrible I really hope it’s just a trend
that janitor joke is tinsy bitsy racist, no?
Every race is racist. Mexicans and blacks hate each other the most.
"Pedro Manuel"
You’re a fool
Really loves Jake this bloke doesn't he 🤣🤣
Addisnon is a tik toker
Love True News
20% of England are on Twitter…1/5th of the country and the MAJORITY of the hateful tweets came from outside the U.K. places like Spain and Germany. I’m sick to death of the self hate we have in England. We are the least racist country in the western world.
To be fair... the guy who wants to be Korean is doing nothing wrong if being transgender is fine. like you said, Youre born a man and turned into a woman and this guy is born British and turned into Korean. You also said that if my mate goes and gets a tan that he isn't spanish.. Well whats the difference between a man going to get his dick chopped off and becoming a woman? Its the same thing when it really comes down to it since its the same ideology
React to Kay’s Cooking please 😁😅
The salty comments about geordie supporting his friend are so funny. like just shut up and enjoy the video😭
Woodley isn't thought of as a top 3 welterweight. His record at the time was but no one puts Woodley in the top 3
Jake Paul farted. Brian, that’s actually a good business plan.
how are you gonna say being a fighter didnt workout when he was a top 5 welterweight of all time
There’s a reason only Jake Paul would think of a STUPID fuckin forfeit like that. Because he’s a child. No other reason ffs. He’s not smart he just literally is an overgrown child. Nobody with any integrity sat watching that press conference thinking “oh my god Jake Paul got him there” 😂😂😂
Did they call Addison Rae a YouTuber 💀💀
True Geordie is a Paul brother hype-man. What a joke.
Saying you identify as Korean now, is as ridiculous as a man saying, I now identify as woman. The cognitive dissonance some people have is now fully on display 😂😂😂
How is it racist to say a woman in a burka looks like a letterbox? Islam is literally based on a racist warlord that owned slaves but everyone here bending over for such a backward ideology lol
True Geordie is a complete sell out now, honestly its a joke what his content has become
Is it just me but Lawrence is quite annoying
True geordie lives In logan and jake Pauls arse... It's embarrassing.
The blue pyjama usually mend because underclothes conspicuously release absent a halting taurus. picayune, bent baritone
Jesus wept
This video could have been a seperate fight preview. Remember the time when True News had several topics.
Jake will take this L in my opinion
Jake Paul blows up Japan- “that’s a smart move from Jake there”
Oh my pull your heads out of the Paul brothers asses ffs 😂😂 yeah we get it you like them... Saying Connor is copying Jake... 🤣🤣🤣 Even if Tyrone loses to Jake Paul... It won't havr any effect on his MMA legacy... Jake Paul would be smashed and broken in half in an octagon... That's why they are boxing 😂😂
The sad thing TG really believe that he’s jake’s friend, jake wouldn’t give to shits about you when die Brian I’ll tell you what
This evening I am going to cover myself in pineapple chunks and identify as Hawaiian
Thank YOU for bringing awareness to Racist Boris Johnson and the racism happening in the UK!! Respect.
The knee was political. Just Check the BLM website demands. It’s nothing to do with standing against racism anymore.
Stop hating on my guy. Love you Geordie! You make really good points and I totally agree with you! Keep grinding big guy!!!❤️
The part with Anthony is gold :D
this is like a net to catch Jake Paul fans for subs
Jake volleys a child  Geordie: see that’s really good business move from jake
I think the powers to be gave up getting a good public leader I mean fuck ours in America is a fucking vegetable for Christ sake 😂
Humans kill me the only time it’s not considered ass kissing is when it’s the person you favor more. Y’all desperately want Geordie to hate on someone sad 😂😂
Brian, your not acting yourself in this vid, you okay mate ?
You guys forgot to mention that this was a "Paid Advertisement" for Jake Paul..  don't forget next time or YouTube will give you a Strike.
Not your best look mate. Tyron won that press conference and outclassed jake at every turn
Money changes people  Money changed Jake  Money Changed Brian  Money is their problem
Why is it a bad thing to say that she likes Donald Trump. The majority of America still likes Donald Trump. You wouldn't know it from social media or MSM but believe me most of America does
The problem with this Forfeit is i don't see either following through with it. Think Woodley hides from the embarrassment of a loss given he's still under the UFC umbrella and Jake just flat out wont give a fuck given it would be his first loss.
Comments BIG MAD😭🤣
Try so hard to be funny bro just tell us what happened
This was a great video my only issue was that the  transracial YouTube had said that their pronouns are they/them and you referred to them as him
like Brians's seconds lockdown fu video ! wasn't that great
is this video sponsored by jake paul? lmao jkjk
Jake losing
so so so so so lost Geordie
This is embarrassing
Why are so many people offended over the way Geordie covered the press conference
Great episode fantastic love the structure good humour and susceptibility to your own surroundings and respects in a great way massive props ❤️❤️❤️
ironic that brian is making fun of someones presenting... clearly doesnt watch the kickoff back.
The fact I had to see that god awful clip of our PM presented by two normal blokes on YouTube and not our national press is a joke!
Your man going Korean is ridiculous, ever see the episode of Southpark and stans dad turns into a dolphin?? Literally the same idea. No issue with identifying as what you want but if you're from England then your English 🙄🙄 Absolute idiot..
Jake Paul gets knocked out in the 1st Rd Brian”That’s such a smart business move by Jake” Geordie” Also elite level at receiving the KO by Jake. If the judges are scoring this I think Jake actually wins the fight still”
The presser was so boring. You can see it on Jake’s face, y’all say it’s him scared, nah it’s him frustrated that the moderator is fucking boring & not even asking relevant questions.
That robot had me dying😂😂
How do you only have 2 million  subs..? Think you both talk the most sense on YouTube.
Sorry but Tyron won the war of words, anyone who watched the full presser knows. Don't know why you guys did this, still like the channel those.
I've never seen you Guys before, but anyone who can pick on Americans with such style deserves my subscription....  Middlesbrough
When will Jake or Logan be ready to box a boxer in a matching weight division?
This is poor even for you
So... Is the fight still happening
Haha conor is copying jake paul . Haha haha
rainin
Jeez this comment section is toxic 😂
Jake’s not gonna shag you Brian
Jake Paul’s fanboy is back!
Tyron said he ain't gonna do the bet. Good. Jake so childish with those bets.
Ufc… ultimate fighting…. Champions 😭😭😭😭😭
I bought my first house by being a dick....pissing people off in the process. Now I capitalise on that buy selling tickets to see me get punched in the face. Yes, I get punched in the face for a living now.
Why did you guys leave out some of the good points woodly made, Like when he said jake is covering his back with all that disney kid talk
Does the "swearing" make people appear tougher or cooler? Just wondering.....
Fuckn hell brian get your lips from around jakes bellend
im an Aussie and i understand all the terminology do not worry Geordie
Jake Paul won’t have to wipe his arse for months after this vid this was a painful watch
You man are the Paul brothers Yes men it's crazy what are they doing for you really???
Stop doing news with the guy on the right he don't know anything
Conner mcgregor had been copying Jake’s Paul … I’m gonna stop watching the vid now lmaoo
has jake actually fought someone in his weight class yet?
You two are great , I could rant all day with a pint with you guys
Big up Antony ❤️
Whose going to tell them Addison Rae is a tiktoker
Wasn't geordie the same one gassing up tyron but now won't show his best bits. What are we even doing anymore lmao.
Hey man love your channel been watching for years but you focus too much on jake Paul, I don’t think anyone actually cares about him. The sooner people stop talking about him the better!
The dude saying his home country is ( Korea) looks like he got a full blown ass whooping
Boris needs to Bogoff 😊
People in the comments are so full of hate for Jake Paul they can‘t even think straight holy fuck.  He is an idiot, but his moves are genius business wise.
The other guy next to Gordon so annoying
To be fair to Addison Rae she is still better than Stephen A Smith and he somehow keeps his job
Most of the ip addresses of the racist tweets were from outside of the UK, look it up dudes
Oh Brian get off jakes nuts 😂😂
Well when you start accepting things like changing sex then people will start pushing further and changing their race and age
Conor isn’t copying Jake 😂😂😂😂 and Conor definitely doesn’t need Jake
Love the Korean ‘transition’ lol. To be fair if we can identify as a different gender, the same mechanism has made him want to identify as a different race. Hilarious though lol
Ayo that bloke in the white shirt is so fucking annoying fr
Brian calling Jake a successful businessman is no surprise... he did singlehandedly bankrupt his own podcast and xo    He obviously knows how business works...
I don't understand how racial equality is being referred to politics, racial equality should be standard
idk why u r framing it like Jake won the press conference.. he chocked on almost every asnwer.. lifted the mic and just opened his mouth and said nothing.. stuttering several times.. not talking back to some hard tyron digs.. its crazy how hard u want to push this narrative man... Ik jake has come a long way but ffs he isnt some gumba genius that is out of the water mentally and physically. He was pressured early in both his last 2 fights but came out strong. Just dont like how mfs make this dpshit out to be some sort legend.
Yeah nnnaahh mcgregor ain't copying paul and he doesn't need paul
How can anyone be mad at this guy for changing race, if you feel you're the wrong race go do your thing. It's the same as changing gender 🤷🏿‍♂️
I love watching this kind of stuff from America because I learn how other people view our terrible slang here😂
Think i can see jake paul' ball juice on his beard.
Laurence is so obnoxiously left with his views is really annoying And the trans-racial comments are funny to hear cause it’s the same exact thing as transgender but they both won’t come out and say anything like that 🤣
I think he should move to North Korea all that plastic surgery and it just made him look like a girl
If u wanna waste 40 mins of ur life watch this video.
i dont know much about boxing, i'll admit, but im cynical enough to know that jake paul does not choose people to fight with who have the possiblity to win against him. jake paul ensures that the probability of him winning is higher than that of losing. so like, what's the point.
Why is trans racial different from trans gender?
Jesus geordie brutha make your mind up are you a jake or Connor supporter when it comes to them being superstars? You sound like a glory hunter.
Woodley has a good point though, yea hes lost a few fights in a row but if you look at who he fought there pretty much all future hall of famers. Colby, Usman, Burns ect. Those guys beat everyone
The sarcasm. Great! Being racist after promoting not to be racist. Stinker! This show is still entertaining but a massive con. I wish I had more money for my opinion. Then I could buy a used Bentley. Takes the piss TG :) True?
You're taking it too far now Brian 😂
Pmsl that bit when true G says they all sweaty hug then kiss 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jake is so delusional yea he's got to start slow and win easier fights but what about when he really has to fight a real killer he's a dead man walking
Tyron has done just fine in these pressers lol. Def didn't "lose" any of em Hes gonna whoop that ass too👌
Wtf 18 surgeries and boom gangnam style
Very transphobic comments in this video. Disappointed, was a big fan of you guys’ show. You guys wouldn’t say the same about people switching genders so why do it towards race which is a social construct made up thing. Again, as I said very transphobic and have unsubscribed and reported 👎👎.
I'm a sex offender who identifies as an innocent man
Would you take Tyron winning if it meant all you could listen to for a year was his music
These are funny af
jake: hits an old lady  brian: see thats good from jake hes getting his name out there.
Is Geordie on crack or something? 😂
Fucking hell like jake Paul much?
Oh great, Jake is finally fighting a boxe... Oh wait.
Connor is definitely not copying Jake Paul... Come on, now.
Why did they leave out Tyron's best bits? The Eagle hairline was pretty good 😂
When Lawrence threw the covid joke at 13 minutes 50 I almost threw my drink up 😂
Y’all ride jake so hard
I’m guessing they don’t have that room no more that’s why they using a green screen behind them?
I bet that kid cant even speak korean the freak
Oilily is the extreme kboo SMH We do not claim them well except the trolls 🙄
BLM is a racist communist supporting group which the footballers support partly when taking the knee that's why people are angry and boo the footballers on the pitch!
So many people basically saying Brian's licking Jake's arse. But when has he actually been wrong about Jake before especially with fight stuff
11:20 Brian looses all credibility
25:09 Brian face 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it really finessing tho if Jake loses and he has to get the Tattoo ⁉️
Now I remember why i stopped watching this
The jokiest part is when they start talking about the moderater's unprofessionalism.....The Very professional True.
Conor all the way 🤨🤨
1:30
The Emotional podcast. If we like you, you're right.
Did they whach a jake Paul video how come they didn't show any of Tyrons responses seems a bit one sided
Logan being on the sidemen channel and enjoying it further alienates Jake from this reality
"this man will fuck your corpse" ...and L nodding...
Where is Anthony’s channel btw
How can true geordie take himself seriously as an mma commentator/ influencer and then get his side kick saying “whoever the fuck tyron Woodley is”
Surprised how much you guys are riding Jake Paul here. Barely giving Tyron any credit
This podcast is terrible
Can't bare watching the one in the white no more I'm out ✌
Of course people think you can change your race you can change your gender, why can’t you change your race right… Oh wait that’s right you can’t change either
man i like brian but this is sad man, hes just riding jake just cus their friends and dont want to be on his bad side man, fuck this
Geordie you’re a wet lettuce, once again losing respect for you video after video. Can’t believe I used to like watching this channel
These comments are fucking gold.
I dont thing TG realises how big Woodley is. The guy walks around heavy and is built like a tank.
The dingbat chat was  hilarious :)
More of a punishment for Jake if he loses tattoos show a lot more on Caucasians
Don't blame Geordie, he need Jake Paul in his podcast one days.
Brian that watch is an absolute belter
At this point Brian may aswell join in on the act by getting an ‘I love jake Paul’ tattoo on his body. He’s got so many anyway so it won’t matter. 😂
At the start I was like the presenter ain’t to bad but the more it went on. Ohh my
This ain't news mate its a Jake Paul tribute fucking sellout smh
True "But the reality is" Geordie
True paulie
the pal on the building site brian is refering to is conor mcgregor btw
Amazing video
Why is geordie a jake paul bandit now? fs what a world
Conor McGregor is copying Jake Paul 🤦‍♂️ someone take his platform to talk about mma he's a good talker but talks utter bollocks
Jake Paul: *says hi* Tyron Woodley: *says hi back* True Geordie: *This was smart from Jake, he’s making Tyron play his game by fighting fire with fire*
jake said he’d fight conor in 3 years, now its canelo ... lol
I hate it when brain talks about mma like he knows what he's talking about
lawrence is such a petty child
Jake Paul haters r stupid ...they r mainly KSI fanboys but now even KSI scammed his fanbase so there goes that
2 on trending damn YouTube loves true news
The dude in the white t shirt is annoying as fuck
Jakes delusional
Loool joker
Dislike for discredit the former leader of the free world
Woodley: alright deal TG: He’s playing the jake paul game But if he doesn’t accept it, I guarantee you he would’ve been called scared 🤷‍♂️ jake paul already wins TG over before the conference begins
11:10 no he didn’t just say that
can you put english caption?
They cut all tyron woodley part
Jake shaves his beard  Geordi: the mind games jake plays are so fookin clever
Jake Paul shits a kid  Geordie: that’s actually a smart thing to do
Brian actually rims jake Paul
Trew news < pew news
I feel like I'm the only one who likes this channel based off the comments 😂
So much negative energy
That presenter for Paul vs Woodley got me cracking up hahaha
Heard Brian and Lawrence will also get an "I love Jake Paul" tattoo regardless of who wins
These guys have lost their credibility
24:46 😂😂😂Lawrence's laugh sums that full story up
People need to stop hating on Brian man
Why did you only react to what Jake Paul was saying in that press conference?Woodley had some great quotes and comebacks that you just skipped over
I swear tyron had so much more lines that just shot jake down fr like jake looked scared- did tg just not see it or is he just that far up jakes arse
What song is played at the start
Fantastic section on Oli London there
It is actually mad to see how Geordie is with Jake... Actually kind of sad.
Im friends with the Paul’s!
So this is why he turns the comments off fuck sake biys
This guy true gordie has talks way too much Just shut up bro
Literally didnt show any of tyrons good parts in the presser
True Geordie being a racist as per usual, let the guy be he wasn’t even that bad.
The way Loz bites his tongue at 18:24 he knew they were walking a fine line with that one 💀
Jake Paul: Does a mass shooting  True Geordie: I like that from Jake, it's amazing. He knows when to pull the trigger and his accuracy is spectacular
This video was so bad
10:35 yeah imma have to agree with Lawrence on this one I don’t know if I concur either 😭😂
TG vs Anthony. Youtube MMA fight, make it happen
*I’m NGL* I haven’t watched much of True Geordie for a while - - but his attitudes on the Paul’s seems to have done a 180
@8:11 tyron on the decline a little bit ?? He’s retired and washed up. Your mate Jake needs to stop these BS fights and actual step in the ring with a boxer if he wants to be taken seriously
he’s saying this like jakes already won
Do they not realise she has 80 million tik tok followers? 😂
The caption is embarrassing
After some serious consideration I'm now Venezuelan
who remembers when geordie wanted to get shat on
Why do you consistently ruin your videos with the inbetweeners wannabe why oh why
Literally he sucks on the Paul’ brothers
TG acting like a politician lobbyist for the Paul brother it’s sickening
Looming at the title, I thought they had already fought
I love when the lads get involved in contemporary political affairs and imbue the coverage of a depressing political landscape with some humour. However, I wish media outlets (not specific to True Geordie et al at all) would stop treating racism as this thing that exists as an interpersonal prejudice. It isn't, it is a technology of power with roots deep in the political institutions and psyche of Britain. Treating it as an individualist problem entrenches the racism of the British government and its attendants, and does not provide any meaningful room for change.
So overweight
Say what you like about Jake Paul but Alan Shearer could have been top quality in the UFC.
What the hell was that at the end actually confrotably stupid
fkn hell this was funny commentary dudes, fkn classic hehe 🍻
How much is Jake paying you? 😂😂😂
Sooooo where the part he forfeits? Oh.
love the vid geordie but i have never in my life heard anyone in this country im in refer to anyone as dingbats connors research wasnt too good
I hope tyron sleeps him..for one night i hope tyron can turn back clock 5yrs to when he looked unbeatable ,imagine how much i love tyron will stand out on that light skin 🤣
Love the true news lads ♥️ please dont turn comments off, the fuckwit jake paul haters mindlessly playing his game are so funny to read.
They actually didnt employ addison rae, it was a joke from her part. she was there because she is from the same place as dustin.
Jake the GOAT
Lol everyone’s going to hate on u Geordie for recognising what Jake Paul is doing well in. Don’t listen to these sheep
Has Brian given up on Connor Mcgregor and moved onto Jake Paul?
The press confrance was beating around the bush, it just felt like they didn't get to the point.
"Finesses" I just don't think TWOOD cares tbh
Does True Geordie wants to uck Jake Paul or something.. tf
Aussie here no idea what a dingbat is
Jake Paul: *breathes* TG: “that’s actually a really good business move from Jake”
Why tf is true Geordie not asking them questions ffs
Is this blackface now? Surely this is racist?
Lol jake paul haters are the dumbest people ever and this comment section proves that once again
Wheres the link for the Anthony channel?
True news always makes my day lads
Me thinking Brian will deffo back to UFC fighter because he’s always been a big fan… Brian - Licks Jakes arse in every video now.  Me - 🤡 🤡 🤡
There were parts of the press conference where Jake Paul was choking on his own words and couldnt mutter proper responses and you guys completely avoid it??? Fucking arselicks...
Surely getting ye eyes pinned back an claiming to be Asian is massively racist??
Probably the most simp show I've ever seen, literally whatever current eh ladies? doesn't matter as long as you can prove it's on-trend... Bottomfeeders.
Stop kissing his arse for views it's embarrassing, this is why you can't be taken serious
“Went off to be a fighter, see that didn’t go so well” Haway Loz wtf are you talking about
Does anyone have a link to the press conference Boris have where he gave that answer? I'm trying to find it on YouTube and I cannot find it.
As long as there are people with poor inductive reasoning skill, then there will always be racism. That means racism is never going away...
The reality of internet success, where clicks and views mean even negative engagement is good engagement. Resulting in a circle jerk of sellouts, publicising amoral people as they all try and take the easy road to wealth and fame. Doesn't mean you can't find entertainment in it, but don't kid yourself that people won't see it for the farce that it is.
this show got cap
At this point you guys are just sucking the Paul's off 🤣
Addison Rae is way overrated I don’t know why she’s famous
Jake Paul: Exists  True Geordie: Great move from Jake there, not many can pull that off
Honestly ignored people saying Geordie bums Jake etc but this title is pathetic.
Jake Paul: *spits on a group of disabled children* Brian: "you can tell he's really thought about how he was going to approach the situation. he's a really smart bloke.."
You have a point Brian UFC well fight fan’s in general will Crucify you if you have have a Opinion and Straight up facts of why this person will lose or win keep up the great work
You guys have been so on point lately damn 🙌 smashing it
18:55
Why do you repeatedly compare jake now to the old mcgregor is literally incomparable and disrespectful to mcgregor
I cant wait the day Geordie will be monitorating on some big press conferences
i like Geordie, but i’ll never understand his hard on for the paul’s and everything they do
Laurence trying to hard to be funny
Brian Jake doesn’t want to be ur friend, so why don’t you give an honest opinion rather than what u think the “popular” opinion is it’s embarrassing watching u verbally wank off these ppl
Get sick of them sucking Jake off to be honest
Yeah just looking at the comments, I'm not gonna watch this one haha
Geordie man I like you but how far you are up the Paul’s arses is crazy they ain’t gonna shag u bro
Let’s just hope they don’t hire some jackass commentators again
“This is BRITISH YouTuber, I get the feeling I might be upsetting him there...” 😂😂😂😂😂
Brian is a real one and the comment section full of morons ffs
The salty comments hahahaaa stay mad. I’m a British 19 yr old and I’m ashamed at most of Britain’s YouTube fans, they’re so fkn stupid 😂😂😂
So many ppl thinking Brian's a jake paul fan boy just because he's not being a sheep and is actually pointing out whats happening and how jakes being successful
Can everyone just leave True Geordie the fuck alone.It’s his opinion,deal with it.
So Geordie just skips past all the good lines by Tyron in the press conference??
You’ve turned into a proper melt you have recently Geordie
Why doesn’t he fight up and coming young boxers to build up to working on getting a shot at the title?
Geordie sounding more and more deluded with every video he makes about Jake
can’t wait for your downfall Brian.. you insecure little man. everyone’s waking up to you, sellout
No wonder Brian turns off comments 😭😭
Brian pls stop doing videos on joke... I get that ur friends but u sucking off Jake is not entertaining... Ur an entertainer focus on entertainment
I think Geordie is a fan of how jake makes money
That was one the best YouTube ad in the beginning
Misleading title
Laurence is clueless about boxing and MMA 😬 doesn’t have a clue
Laurence was soo annoying this ep... soo nit picky and stupid... trying way too hard to be funny... stfu
Could TTG bumlick Jake Paul anymore
Wait a second. THE PLASTIC SURGERY GUY IS 18?! EIGHTEEN?!
I love the fact there’s at least one ‘the office’ reference in every true news
I've just decided in Korean Hahahahaha
That Oli thing looks like Billie Eyelish
Oli London is literally the epitome and embodiment of cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation personified.
Jake Paul crashes his lambo Brian: Thats actually a great business move and also he’s playing the jake paul game
Hypocrisy at its finest here lads
I love u guys, but can you PLEASE stop sucking off jake paul so much. This show used to be one of my favourites, but now every time you cover him its just painful. Kinda ruins the whole video.
Jake- does that weird fisting motion with his arms  Geordie- I'd fucking love that
Edits out all Woodleys comments lol legit slagging off jp for the duration of the press
hey it’s the guy who fanboys over the Paul brothers and his funny mate again 🙂
How you guys walk the line between, raw brutality towards idiots, yet are somehow one of the most wholesome shows on YouTube I will never understand. Yet against all odds you pulled it off. Great works boys, Love from Israel
What's gawan everybody it's da tru geordie
Laurence should work on his jokes because ‘and he goes:’ and ‘then he says:’ and *raise voice and quote aggressively* jokes isnt funny.
Geordie gets stupider ever video
I’m not a jake Paul fan but you all hate him because your jealous of his lifestyle. He’s annoying but y’all fuel it with your jealousy
jesuss calm down geordie
Why do must people who dont use she/he pronuos but use they/them. do they like to be a groupe of poeple
Jake is lowkey huge. His legs are ridiculous
0:56 😭😭😭😭
23:44 wtf is that?
Geordie really wants that Jake Paul D
Brian wants Jake Paul to validate his self worth as a Youtuber. As a result you get this insane Jake Paul love from him. Lets try to overlook it 😅🤏
"None of theae bits match its like playing Mr Potato head"_😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭
I though Jake came off hella nervous
Critiquing Addison Rae for not having enough experience and then Sucking off Jake Paul as a boxer for the whole video is a funny level of irony
Please get your lips back from around jake Paul’s bollocks
Nothing on England game?
Man went from breaking down on camera because of the Paul’s to now twerking for them every video they are mentioned.
23:50 it’s good to see that clowns exist also in the UK, not just America
Very good video
Lawrence is just to funny
Why did they ignore tyrons monolog about treating it like a real fight. That made jake look scared. I hate how brian dosn't even attempt to be unbiased.
Might be because I’m not from the UK but ur co host is extremely annoying
MMA fans talked up McGregors punching power before his fight with Floyd and Mayweather walked him down as if he was an amateur. Punching power in MMA is completely different to punching power in Boxing, so we'll see on fight night if Woodle really does have stopping power in the boxing ring.
Stop moaning Jesus Christ
Conor is copying Jake Paul now? 😭 cmon Brian you couldn’t be riding Jake any harder
Did I miss something because I didn't see tyron forfeiting in the video
Brian was on BT sport talking about how he use to be a fan boy of Conor but he knows more about MMA and boxing so now he's a fan boy of Jake Paul and I'm sure in a couple years he won't regret it way way more than he did with Conor
This is pathetic. Sad to see grown ass men falling for the facade.
Could you even imagine if what they said about the Korean guy but were talking about someone who was transgender, instantly cancelled.
the way brian rides jake paul is so embarrassing he literally just said conor mcgregor is copying jake paul😐
All the people hating on jake paul are BUMS doing no good with their life..
You can’t say he is top 3 ever. You have my respect always, but that one makes me question you lol.
The guy talking talks like a priest
This is sus af, why these clowns kissing up to paul??
The likes and dislikes must have got reversed somehow , this video is bandwagon trash
Imagine the Conor McGregor vs Jake Paul press conference jeez Jake would have nothing to say
UFC pays theie ring girls more than the fightters😂😂😂
I'm rooting for Jake I think he's a twat but now it's not at one of our boys it's funny
We love Jake Paul
the Wade concept should suck Geordies cognas
All y'all butthurt because Bryan ain't a blind hater 😂
I like how everyone dislikes Geordie admiring jake paul but he keeps on doing it. I don't like jake too but I'm not blinded by the hate. Man's a good trash talker, but y'all ain't gonna admit it.
Jake: “ sips water “ Geordie: “ his hydration is elite “
this was the first time i’ve seen jake look a bit flustered and intimidating by an opponent, i was looking forward to hear you talk about that instead of relentlessly fanboying
1.40 conors face looks so funny 😂😂😂
When r u gonna get Jake back before him VS Tyron!!!
When you are unbiased towards a fighter or person you make so of the best analysis content on YouTube, seeing this makes me really sad🚮
this was in ohio where jake is from and the crowd was way louder for tyron, he destroyed the press conference. i think you’re opinion of jake has gone from honest to brown nose :/
True geordie on normal topics: "censorship is bullshit its bad, its a slippery slope" True geordie on Boris Johnson: "look at what he said as a joke years ago, there's no way he can be allowed to uphold his position"  Nice.
No more food review?? We need it back boys
Why are they licking Jake Paul’s arse so much
Surprised this account hasn't been renamed "The Paul tribute page" at this point
The one real race, is the nascar race
Just imagine if Oli London decided he identified as African instead of Korean. This is the fucked up evolution of woah Vicky
Not sure that Conor is exactly copying Jake mr Geordie
True geordie. Oh how you have fallen. You used to be a good lad, representing British culture, saying things how they are. You are so far up the arse of the Paul train you might aswell set up camp and live off there clegnuts. And worst of all you claim to be A fight fan and actually have work on bt talking about ufc. You’re a joke man you deserve to loose you’re platform. Waste man.
Remember this is the pyscho that filmed dead people for views
LLF🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
Listen I don’t like jake but tg is right he pretty clearly won the press conference.
She wasn't sacked boys
The disrespect on McGregor's name in this video is mind boggling.
Does Geordie get a cut off the Paul brothers PPV or something ?😂🤣
Lmao jake Paul said Conor needs him more than he does 😂😂😂  #1 on Forbes list 100x his net worth 😂😂
There will be Geordie tears live on stream if Woodley beats Jake Paul
Conor did not copy Jake Paul. Stfu. Please stop hating on Conor.
If you allow people to identify as a gender that they are not then you have to let people identify as whatever nationality they want or age ect. That's why it's all bullshit.
Was falling asleep until you mentioned AR. Awake straight away
Shills.. unsubbed.. I encourage many more to follow
Brian and Laurence are so wholesome and nice
Is it bad I like Jake Paul as an MMA fighter now? He’s still a prick and would waste my breath on him In the street. But as a fighter he’s entertaining and I want him to win :/
Jake paul actually said he's gonna fight canelo in 3yrs lmao..... Brian your boys going to sleep!!!
Peekaboo
I hope I never again hear Geordie talk about the purity of any sport, when he always goes on about Jake being good for anything. It's all about money and "clout". When Tyrone sleeps him, let's hope he dissappear s
Much dong licking going on here
It's common knowledge that McGregor has been doing what Jake Paul does for years, Jake is a McGregor copycat
I love Brian but at this point the only reason he's backing Jake is because he's on YouTube and he's backing the YouTube team. He's buddy's with the Paul's so now he's backing them till the end.
Bare man blinded by hate
and TG, stop being salty and trying to put down other presenters just because you arnt hired. You arnt owed a spot. Every one of your points towards him was petty
So far up jake’s hole. Woodley deserves more respect
This video will get Brian cancelled in 10 years when trans-racialism is normal
I found the bit with the "korean" guy hilarious but then it made me think imagine in a couple years if this becomes a normal thing, just funny how the world can change so quickly
Mate, what happened to Geordie man  Lost himself
Why does big bad bri not just have a fight boxing or MMA then he can showcase the fight knowledge he always attempts to demonstrate.
18:19 😂😂😂😂😂😂
No way did Laurence just back of what I thought he was going to say... “Ultimate, Fighting, C....Champions” that’s dark mate 😂😂😂😂😂 fair play.
Geordie definitely buys Jake Paul merch
This is disgraceful
Am I stupid in saying that the guy who “identifies as Korean” is a bit racist? If I just went and painted myself black, and then stated I identify as a black person, wouldn’t that be pretty insulting and very racist?
Wow. Thought you guys were a little smarter than that. Wow. Okie dokie. Out.
Haha little does Geordie know the crowd was cheering Donald Trump louder then any fighter when he entered the building.
Great vid as usual
Jake Paul clearly lost this conference and they still find a way to make it seem like he won easily 🤣. Smh
true news makes my fucking week
The problem is i love Tyron woodley is true for jake paul.
Makes me laugh how every one wants to talk about the racism but no one wants to actually change anything or have real in depth conversations about it. Why is no one talking about how not all but the vast majority of the abuse came from other countries, specifically Muslim countries?
Korea boo is coming for you  has British flag in the background
Wow. Cringe
Argh yes, the real covid patient zero.. the Ding-Bat
LMAO just imagine identifying as black to get the n-word pass
No one wants racism but let's be honest it was gesture politics and a lot of virtue signaling 🤣 tell me one thing it changed?
Anyone got a link to Anthony’s channel I can’t find it
Why did you edit it to make it look like tyron didn’t say anything. I know you like Jake but isn’t it true news not true Geordie & Jake Paul best buddies 😂 guessing the comments will be turned of next video because that’s how you deal with criticism.
30:23 highlight of the vid🤣🤣🤣☠
2 pricks fighting each other. Stop feeding this BS world.
Everything they said about it being stupid to change rase can be applied to trans people as well lol
anthony is a legend
Trans women is as much women as Ollie London is Korean.
anthony is a legend
I swear I thought he said “ I identify as they them and Korean Jimmy “
you gotta check out this white youtuber that thinks he's black and does skin modification.
Jake:*literally shits from his mouth* Georide: “this is why he is a successful businessman, look how genius he is!”
Geordie are u ok?  lol do you even know what you are saying anymore
So brian has gone from a conor fanboy to a jake fanboy 🤣
You know times are bad when one of the most hated people in the world who is also a youtuber trying to be a boxer is given more respect than a professional ufc legend. Sad times.
Absolute banger. These comments are a small minority who watch your videos. Most people just watch and enjoy then move on.
To be fair to the Korean lad, his English is very good.
Let’s applaud people who have a mental health problem by saying they aren’t what they were biologically born as but spread concern for someone who claims they’re another nationality. I find it offensive as a male thats found it difficult to be “manly enough” and been belittled and mocked throughout my life and made to feel incredibly insecure, only to watch a biological woman say they’re the same gender as me and be told how brave they are for battling adversity. I’m sick to death of this ridiculous culture we’ve been forced into. What I’m delighted to see is people are starting to get fed up with the hypocrisy and stupidity of it all. Anyway I identify as a helicopter and I’d appreciate if you refer to me as “whirlybird. I wonder who that’d end up offending? 🚁 💨
love how laurence just turns into david brent at 31:40
Tyron did well in the conference tho y’all didn’t show that lol
only Jake Paul has an emotional support robot.
I want to sub to Anthony’s channel but having trouble finding it, does anyone by any chance have a link?
Great video guys
Just to be clear These two are the only people on youtube that make me enjoy ads 😂 I always skip them, but not on this channel ❤😂
I knew the comments were gonna be like this XD
Addison Rae is one of the biggest TikTok stars, and also they asked her to interview Dustin because they are both from Same home town
Geordie became one of those channels that shits on anything that he’s not apart of
damn he's found a new man crush after Conor let him down
again a fucking paul video.... FFS!!!
First episode don’t know his name but Gordie’s co host here is one of the funniest fuckers I’ve ever seen
Jake Paul: Farts  Geordie: Very smart response from Jake there, he's living in Tyron's head rent free
Geordie went from being a mctapper fan to a Paul sexual
The fact this guy probably cant even speak korean, like he could so easily go immerse himself in korean culture and even like become a citizen, but instead he just gets surgery on his eyes
5:04 hmmm....  0:00 - 1:33 👀 what was the sponsor again?
Geordie looks like Mack from Rogue company 😂😂 big muscular guy with a very similar looking beard
Brian’s D riding of Jake is getting completely out of hand, the guy probably flies to America to clean his shoes at this point.
Is Geordie bumming Jake?
12 minutes in, I'm not finishing this and neither should anyone else. Brian has become a Paul fanboy. Anyone who's seen this press conference knows Woodley killed it, Jake had no comebacks at all.
Fools fooled by a fool
The whole Addison Rae thing was a joke haha
Is it only me that thinks Jake Paul’s press conferences are always lacklustre and feel forced. Jakes just trying to what Mcgregor used to be saying these chilling lines but just comes across to cringe IMO
This bit right here got me boys. 18:18 😂
I stopped watching their videos and they turned into Jake Paul bumlickers
You can’t identify as whatever the fuck you want end off 😂😂😂
I’m Korean because I’ve got those eyes
Conor McGregor copying Jake Paul, I love you Geordie but pelase
Just a heads up, Addison Rae was only brought on because she is from the same city as the guy who fought Connor and made a *JOKE* and was only doing this one thing for UFC and people cried and bitch. People are so sensitive.
I don’t know who it will be more embarrassing for when he has to get that tattoo, Brian or Jake
Can we get Brian and Lawrence to take over dramaalert
I imagine trans nationalism (or whatever the fuck its called) will become normalised in the next 6 months to a year and Laurence and TG will release a video apologising profusely about this very episode. Can we all just get back to living in reality instead of pandering to every thought ppl have and pretending its fact.
Geordie has replaced Mcgregor with Jake
Olli looks like Johnny Depp when he played Willy Wonka
Yikes
Love the Anthony content
I identify as black so Boris can't ban me
Love Anthony ♥️ His sense of humour is right up my street!
'McGregor's actually started to copy Jake Paul' 😭  Something's totally wrong when True Geordie's become a JP yes man
Love how they’re only showing Jake highlights…..
That "press conference" was so bad I passed on watching and decided to watch this instead.
Nothing wrong with the Paul Bros
True news is GOATED
So geordie just casually says mcgregor copies jake and no one cares
Would jake beat  George masvadal in a boxing match????
Loving the flash back comment from Brian
Mcgregor will still do huge ppv numbers, he just broke his leg, which means if he returns the hype will probably be even bigger.
The little weak liberal sidekick is ridiculously annoying..
anyone breathes: Laurence: Boris Johnson is the worst human in existence
god i love laurence
"I do look Korean now" - Ricky Gervais 😂
Geordie broke me at "HOMIES" lmaooo
When bri said oil London gave him dont fuck with cats vibe i suddenly realised he looked similar (and had the same. Vibe) as luca magnotta
Wtf brian..newcastle is harder and madder than compton
Why do people slag off brian do yer parents not give ye enough attention
Them talking about the trans racial guy if you switched that with gender it makes just as much sense you can't change your gender or your race
1:30 skips add
1:35 That intro is sick asf.... Also Jake is starting to grow on me, idk if that's a good thing lmao
Not a Jake Paul fanboy. But Jake is good at what he does. Clearly, were still here 5 years later talking about him
Wtf is that title?? So weird man, you don't have to lie & clickbait for views.
jesus stop brian
83% off ffs geordie
From validly criticizing Jake Paul to being a great fan, the character development is amazing. <3
Jake Paul runs over a group of children- Brian “that’s actually really smart from Jake”
Ayyyyy
25:13 😭😭😭😭
There is no way this man actually believes Conor copies jake
Jake Paul: *sucker punches 90-year old lady* Geordie: “This is why Jake could beat Ali and Tyson on the same night”  Can’t believe I ever respected you lmao
So they don't even show Tyrons sound bites? He makes Jake fucking tremble in this seat lmao. I watched it, at least be somewhat impartial
Not gonna lie I really don't give a fuck about the Pauls
I’ve never seen someone look and sound so confident while making awful takes and claims as geordie I like him but he just isn’t that educated on fighting
I like how they are telling people how racism is wrong and then completely  destroys and mocks another society issue just because it isn't as important as the other
i think if jake paul beats tyron i’ll give him credit but i just can’t see it happening
Kinda rate how jake goes about fights he’s bossing it. Low-key want him to win.  Still team jj though
Can't believe TG is twerking for Jake Paul. Madness
Finesses 🤣🤣 what a pathetic sad way to describe how 1 person makes another look stupid
True gordie must have Jake Paul in Bed
19:00 absolute respect for u Geordie
You can change races now lol
Yeah this fight is a fix though right? I mean this isn't going to be a legit fight is it? Just hurry up and get jake paul in the ring with Tommy, an actual boxer. I actually respect that jake paul has worked hard at his boxing skills, but there are levels to everything. Paul seems to be making claims he is a legit elite level boxer when he really isn't at the moment.   Paul is a decent amateur boxer but we don't know just how good he actually is until he sets foot in the ring with an actual boxer.
20:59 can’t believe loz didn’t say ‘paupers to kings’
When transitioning race inevitably becomes a pop social movement in a few years; this will be the video they use to cancel Brian and Lawrence.   U both really show a lack of critical thinking in this video by literally mocking someone who is clearly mentally unstable, and the fact that they have used the exact same logic as someone transitioning gender to do so.  How on earth is transitioning race any more deluded than transitioning gender?  Showed ur true colours boys.
Geordie : “DAZN, Showtime, how am I not employed by you, I cannot be worse than this!”   The last thing we need is seeing you praise Jake Paul LIVE Geordie. Respectfully 😂
"Is there anything This Morning will not prostitute for views." Don't watch it or care but the irony in that statement made me chuckle
Death Taxes Connor mcgregor 3 things guaranteed in life.
Geordie loves the Paul’s
I actually can’t believe how people these days are literally saying “I identify as….” & the society has made it so everyone has to agree with it… It’s actually a beyond a joke now
This British guy is taking cultures as if he’s back in imperial days 😂
Love you Brian
*Jake Paul farts*  Geordie : The kid’s a genius
Her an Dustin are from the same town that why she was brought in for that interview she was never hired full time for the UFC
Did you cover the matt Hancock thing
The Jake Paul fan club has arrived.  Are you boys on his paycheck.
I don’t identify as bri-ish
True Geordies nose so far up Jake Paul’s ass 🤣 embarrassing man
Lawrence is a legend
My country's president speaks like that moderator! Not a great one...
Tyron woodley knows what hes doing lol. He wants this to be huge just like jake does. Hes not playing into jakes game, hes playing his own game..
EPIC humor
Fun, entertaining stuff, but then they go woke towards the end. Yikes.
By the sounds of it, Brian probably already has a Jake Paul tattoo with a love heart around it.
*I look Korean now" low key racist and all 🤣🤣
Not male of female 😂 behave
I see Geordie is embarrassing himself again ....
Fucks sake.  I was crossing my fingers Lawrence wouldn’t be in this video 🤦‍♂️
7:15 ‘U went away to become a fighter, that didn’t go so well, but u became champion at some point’- Lawrence. 🤨
I like TKO. But this isn’t it. This is the suck off Jake Paul show and it’s pathetic now.
I wonder if he felt Korean before BTS? 😂
Geordie talks in favor of jake Uk/ksi stans: gEorDie Is a yEsman😡
We love abit of True news
So if this lad is now Korean and he’s only 18 he will have todo the two years of mandatory military service they require
HERE BEFORE COMMENTS GET TURNED OFF
Jake: hits a child Brian: you see I like that from jake, that puts him in the news
People hate Jake so much that anyone acknowledging that he is doing good with his career gets hate as well.
Jake paul has copied mcgregor 5+ times mcgregor "copied" (not really copying just a diss) once
Buying used cars isn't horrible, once you drive a new car off the lot it goes down tremendously in value
brian and loz saying all Koreans look the same after criticising boris' comments, smh
Loved the last part of this vid 😅
Jakes gonna pay him off
They never agreed on the size so I would get the smallest tattoo possible where you wouldnt even be able to read it.
" jake paul has a good point there" true geordie 17th July 2021 every fucking 15 seconds
How tf does Conor need jake when he’s never spoken about the clown, is worth 400million more than him, has all the money in the world?? And jake talks about Conor 24/7 let’s not forget jake is a fanboy😂💀
Love this channel honestly
Had to dislike the video for the blind, sheep-like Trump hate.
“Like someone’s playing mr potato head” 💀 😂 😂 😂 😂
All the jokes and insults that laurence and brian have used against oli, could be used against a transgender person. I'd love for them to explain the difference other than one is right and one is wrong.
U guys are great but yall be hating on things for no reason
I want Tyron to win But I think jake paul is gonna win
I love Brian but god everytime he talks about Jake it’s painful how much he licks his arse, I get backing your friend but fucking hell
Conor is copying Jake? Oh please what the fuck are you talking about
I actually want jake Paul to win so he can fight mcgregor
Woodley wont actually do it though 😂. Jake finnessed himself because hes the only one who would stick to that bet. So if he loses hes fucked . And let's face it. Its likley
Conor McGregor is copying Jake Paul    Ok
95%+ of racist posts were from outside the UK, get some facts right for once ffs.
Love the fun you two clearly have filming these, it's contagious.
Never Laughed so hard at an ep of true news🤣, great job lads... (see I'm British now cause i used term " Lad " although I'm Iranian 😂😂😂)Lmfao
25:12 made me laugh so hard lol you actually look so confused... like u should be lol
This title is confusing. I thought the fight got cancelled.
Racial... transition... surgery. 🤦‍♂️ I’ve officially seen it all
Conor vs nate 3 wud do 2m ppv buys
I ain’t even a Jake hater , but tbh this is the first press conference I’ve actually seen him a bit flustered , I think he will do really quite well but I think Woodley will beat him tbh happy to be wrong , just Woodley is too confident
100k is expensive banter 😂
30:11 THIS MAN WILL FUCK YOUR CORSE 😂😂😂😂
You lads need to make a “Praising the Paul’s” bit, where you talk about what the Paul’s are doing/wearing/screwing etc. Or just marry them, either way.
I listen to the adverts
get too my robinson on
And the Paul news continues
World class arse licking on display here Brian 👍
Jake Paul- *breathes*   Geordie- “see he makes a good point there”
30:08 best bit
"FINESSES" ?? Lmaooo
u can tell Anthony will be absolutely buzzing when he sees this. Big up yourselves lads 💙
Used to like Brian but he’s slowly becoming the social climber sucking up to the Paul’s
Anyone else realise the massive hypocrisy in giving someone hell for "not being in reality" and the reality of "I identify my corsa as a lambo" is stupid mentality...yet in the next sentence say how they can totally appreciate someone not feeling attached to their gender and wanting to be referred to as the opposite or neither, as if your gender is something you can reject or should feel attached to? Its just as stupid a mentality as someone rejecting their nationality for another.
Jake Paul: **Exists** Brian: And that is why Jake Paul is better than every boxer to have ever existed
Jake paul can't be classed as a pro boxer who has a boxing career if he has never fought a pro boxer himself. Am i the only one tht thinks this??? His record should be 0 n 0,  if he wants to be classed as a boxer  he needs to fight official boxers 🤔🤔🤔
Studied Broadcast Journalism for three months and got in the UFC, took me three whole years and I'm nowhere near the UFC or sports broadcasting 😂
bois your politics are awful you can do whatever you want but fuckk...
i hate how these guys have sold out to jake
Hate to say it, TG has been brainwashed by the Paul Brothers.
Brian has a point I think Koreans would be offended
We're wearing the same top sort of
I think loz and Brian missed the joke Addison was clearly implying
i wish tyron said i will get a tattoo but if you lose you have to go bald. he has a massive problem with his hairline and he would likely just say no
I can not believe my ears did Geordie just say Connor is copying Jake😂😂😂
Brians face at 25:05 killed me
You guys know that addison rae didn’t actually get a job or get sacked right?
Tyron had Jake paul shaking haha you cut it all out
Lawrence actually has me pissing myself laughing in these 🤣🤣
The english woman that says hes Korean is the same kid that changes the club he supports every week
True news has more integrity than the BBC
Addison is one of the biggest tik-tokers. A lil more research pls
If that guy wanted to be Korean, go stay there. Learn the language learn the culture. Don't just fucking get surgery to make your face look kind of like someone who is Korean and say your Korean, its fucking crazy.
Sell out
He should have said, “how about this. If you win, Jake, I’ll donate my entire purse to your charity. Just like you wanted. But if I win, you must meet me in the cage(a contract must be signed to make sure that he shows up to fight mma, just like a contract would be signed for tyron to donate his purse)   I guarantee Jake would have bitched out
Jake is winning, I belibe.😂😂
Tyron clearly won this press conference
just a bit confused where we now draw the line when it comes to identifying as something, if a man can identify as a woman even tho they were clearly born a man then why can't a man also identify as a Korean even tho their British. bc its not trendy to do so??
This is the first Jake fight that I don’t know whos gonna actually win
Is brian a joke pauler
bruh they really gonna act like addison dont got 100 mil on tiktok :O
1:55
Looking good Brian lad.....and Lawrence obv
Laurence is definitely going to turn out to be a "wrong'un"    whatever that means...
What you guys said about that British YouTuber, you could say the same thing to transgender people 😂😂
Grown men are doing this
Brian stop sucking up to Jake please. 7:48 you say “Clever response from Jake”, but it’s not. Not at all it makes him look like an idiot 😂
Best show on YouTube. Hey true Geordie, just a heads up- you guys should speak with your contact at Spotify. I noticed with other shows like impaulsive, TMG podcast, BFF’s, etc etc- their episodes show up on Spotify at the same time they show up on YouTube. This is good cause a lot of people I’m sure are like me and like to listen in the background while using there phone for other things. I would just try and figure out why it seems to take 12-24 hrs for your episodes to appear there. Might be an easy fix. Thanks!
i honestly hate lorrance with a passion
Why didn’t you show Tyron woodley shutting down jakes points to make him look like a bitch, you rent boy
respect for clickbaitiest title of the year award
Geordie, I love your content mate and I know your friends with the Paul brothers. But come on you didn't show a single clip of anything Tyron said that completely shut Jake down. Please stop covering this stuff if you're not going to be fair and neutral
you guys are the best
Nobody likes Jake so Geordies just sucking extra hard to balance it out.
if jake actually wins we have to give him major respect i cannot see a world where tyron woodley does not destroy him
If he can do that can I he 6 foot and have a full head of hair
19:10 Jesus Christ Lawrence ahahahahahahahahahahahah brilliant
He really just said Fiennest there was no finesse because this nigga finna lose and Ohio will burn down because of it and I will laugh
True Geordie kissing jake’s ass is great to watch
Hopefuly within the next 10 years Jake might actually fight a boxer
You lot skipped out a lot of stuff, bar the stupid stoop to accept the bet Jake offered him Twood won this press conference
💪💪
Definitely gonna try that
true news is just the best thing on YouTube
You’ve been slacking on the true news
I hate Jake Paul's guts but he did win the conference, PLEASE Woodley Knock his ass out. But gotta give it to Jake smart fighting smaller, older fighters with no boxing experience, that's a bullys mentality but it's smart, but FUCK I hate him.
25:53 😂
In all fairness, that would actually be one of Jake Paul's better tattoos
little did we all know, jake has a piece of geordie's soul in his pocket... matter in fact, we all kinda figured it out
Damn. I thought the showtime guys was pretty good.  Oh, also Jakes gonna win.
Jake Paul the pro boxer who hasn't had a fight with a pro boxer ha
I like True Geordie and all but he and Lawrence pick apart every single thing Tyrone Woodley says even if it's not stupid and have some sort of agenda against him whereas they suck Jake off even though he's the most idiotic person on this earth just so he can get Jake on his podcast it's kinda annoying and stupid imo
Federalize marijuana in America 🇺🇸
Is it even a true geordie upload if it’s not sponsored
Is JP paying these guys gambling debts or something, wtf they turned into his yes men
How does he taste lad
Ksi show was meh
It makes me laugh that people think jake has a chance against Woodley just coz he beat the worst gib weve ever seen and a bloody basket ball player and a bloody ufc fighter who has no stand up game🤣🤣
Is this self-styled boxer ever going to fight a boxer by any chance, once you've all took your tongues out his a hole, could you ask him please? 🙏
It's sad how desperate Brian is for a little attention seeker like Jake Paul's attention. The arse licking in this title is pathetic man
Love the video Bryan much love from ireland 🇮🇪 keep up the amazing videos
1:30 your welcome
Perfect timing...tipsy af😂
I SHOULD OF PAID £18 FOR THIS NOT KSI
Geordie posting right after the KSI show. Smart
This randomly came up on recommended in the 1st minute lmao
I was confident Jake was gonna beat Ben, I’m even more confident that he’ll get his ass handed to him by TWood
I don't give a fuck about the presenter!
loved your post malone album reaction. can you ksi new album AOTP reaction please.take care
Geordie riding that Paulie express hard!
1:34 thank me later
Here on time
We love you Brian, we do
Never clicked on anything quicker! True News is back, you love to see it ❤️
I'm glad you waited till after the ksi show lol
True News is the one thing on YouTube that I get hyped to see when I get the notification
1st :p
Keep the good content of boys
I don't think Tyron will actually do it if he loses tbh - I think he's just hoping if he wins that he'll make Jake do it
great
POV: You didn’t buy the KSI show
This is more entertaining than the ksi show and it’s free
Hell yeah, was looking forward to this episode!
