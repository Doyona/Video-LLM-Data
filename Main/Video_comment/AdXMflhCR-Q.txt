No she's not talent sorry. And also she was preaching that there is no excuse for people who don't apparently want to work she basically put it. She is fortunate that her hobby is her job and I'm not knocking her for it. Everybody has their own niche but some people have learning difficulties and mental health. I feel and many others find she came across very condescending and to be honest not that educated in her social skills. She has a lot of growing up to do I guess.
100% agree with Carol and Sunetra!
