Tell him to come to America. We'll catch him for you, hopefully before the cops or military does. We have a thing for muslim extremism here in the states:)
It was a LORRY    not a  van.....   very inportant
Hes been  found....
Double your budget. That is the UhmeriKKKan way.
GO, King, GO
Well I'm outside and now my bloody fish and chips are in bits on the floor.
Danelo cavalcantel
Wow a super spy from Iran
Mrs Richards: "I paid for a room with a view !"   Basil: (pointing to the lovely view) "That is Torquay, Madam ."   Mrs Richards: "It's not good enough!"   Basil: "May I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window ? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?..."   Mrs Richards: "Don't be silly! I expect to be able to see the sea!"  Basil: "You can see the sea, it's over there between the land and the sky."   Mrs Richards: "I'm not satisfied. But I shall stay. But I expect a reduction."   Basil: "Why?! Because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment  ?"
A highly trained remf 😂😂😂
Your's Van... in europe is a Truck.
He's been seen back in Iran, you morons blew it
England is crawling with CCTV yet took police 75 hours to find this little pip-squeek!
Why is this such a big story? What else is happening in the UK for this to be used as a such a huge distraction?
Whoever let him Escape should be sacked.
😂😂😂sukkels
Terror suspect?? What he do, use the wrong pronoun??
Usa is having escaped murderer right now think 2 so far escaped lol
a "terror suspect" ? Woooahh, I am ... terrified.
they title themselves officers despite no officer rank on the shoulder, he is right under their nose or borrowed one of the dinghies and on the way to France where foreign legion will give him a new identity.
What does the budget got to do with thier intelegance in this case????
Isn’t that on a movie I keep seeing the short on youtube
Why aren't they covering the incompetent government, instead of this smokescreen? The schools are crumbling into dust. I bet public schools are doing alright so they don't give a toss.
PsyOp
Now he's been caught ,put him in a box , put the box in a cupboard under the stairs and let's forget about him , never to been seen again
Whats the big deal? At least this guy exposed a way to escape which wont happen again.
Terroirst gets a job in jail kitchen how?
100% he gets caught whilst riding a bike. Tenners in.
Trying to find foreigner in London 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Coming up 9/11 and all 🙄
20k Reward for a door left open and free chef uniform and a trip on a lorry. Sounds like easy money 😅 the odds are better than William Hill. Who won the first 20k Reward we want to know 😂😅
Something stinks about this whole story
Have you checked for him under his bed ?
Just another distraction from the other agenda, strange that he is soldier but has been labelled a terror suspects for planting fake bombs 😂
he’s still on the run ! It’s his ingenuity is it ? I wager it’s his vast network.
If he strapped himself its obvious he had help. Theres no way he could have found the strapping points, rigged the straps, and strapped himself in without help from someone. Id first look at the driver.
🍩🍩 over here guys !!!
Since when could you even be imprisoned over suspicion?
The terrorist you never heard about...
There's gonna be a movie about this.
He used to play for my football team lol 😂 he was good but was always depressed when turned up to training
Some resource he had being caught 6 miles away 😅
Ok with that,😂😂 But what you are doing with the rest whoo are dancing every day in London and the rest of the UK 😢 😜
Getting away from the scene as quickly as possible is the most important thing surely. Hanging around will only end one way.
well presented good stuff was a joy to watch
A former soldier that was trained? LOL trained to be infantry. This wasnt some navy seal SAS escape and evasion expert.
He's in Chiswick.
Wait for a news of his death he definatly been kidnapped by intelligence
Did not some report mention his family had a flat in Kensington or  some other such super rich enclave of London, if so then ilt is obvious, the tories have aided him to escape, family must have lots of dosh, maybe even mummy and daddy are donors to the Nazi Party.  Obviously a right wing job, maybe Suella has him hidden eh? Got money doesn't matter who you are all welcome aboard the ship of corruption, or should İ say barge?
Damm, Wandsworth Prison was very good at executing murderers, for many decades among very tight security. It appears that their current security measures is seriously lacking and I will bet that they probably gave this delivery vehicle just a quick one over, before it was allowed to leave the Prison. 😒
Well done for you caught your man eventually with the help of the public and him casually walked down the high street near his home in the same city so ulez strikes again with surveillance recognition tech come in useful this time
you wont find him if Michael Scofield is with him!
Benny Hill show.😂😂😂😢😢😢😂😂😂
london has loads of cameras, yes, however,...restropectively the idea is fantastic...however, in a running law and order, time is of the essence...
it takes ages to piece together all the cameras in london...should had they hit the ground running, it perhaps might have not taken so long
They let social workers run the prison.
The last place hes gonna go is an airport or ferry terminal, he'll lay low for a while then get in a lorry going to Europe.
what is a terrorist is it some one that beats up old people or sells drugs on the streets or some one that lies to the tax man or some one that obtains grants from the government and never pays it back how do you define a terrorist because there are many of them in the uk that seem to get away with it with out prosicution such as politicians that promise one thing then when they are in power never do them.
Legend & good luck.
Will wait for the movie with fervent excitement
britishers and their hate for muslims and in this case the chap is just from middle east thats the only crime he commit, no human value no human rights, insallah one day
Mean while at Dover.......
You just couldn't make it up WHY THE FCUK WOULD HE BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE BRITISH ARMY🥴
They keep calling him "a well trained soldier." Well trained in what? From the pictures he looks like a 5 foot computer nerd who weighs 100 pounds dripping wet. Here in the USA a murderer climbed a prison wall and escaped, WHILE ON VIDEO CAMERA!
They’ve got him
It sounds like a blind man could have escaped from Wandsworth prison I don’t think it’s because he’s resourceful. Any escape plan requires ingenuity but it’s sounds like this plan fell right on his lap.
Perhaps he's hiding in Tottenham's trophy room ?
The british army are the best soldiers in the world, thats why our police cant find him..We are just far too good at training our soldiers 😂😂😂😂😂 HE WAS A SIGNALLER FFS 😂😂😂
Hidden right under the old bills nose 🕌.
20K? Ur having a laugh no chance
I hope the lad makes it🤣🤣🤣 Seriously there's something about this story that makes me want to route for him. I think its the breaking out from the system and all these stuffy suited men reporting on him and the police showing their total incompetence. Its like a film with a good ending🤣 And what's he in for really??? providing secrets to Iran? christ. Thats like giving the winning lottery ticket to a tramp who's too drunk to walk
£20k reward!!! Who’s paying for that then the useless prison staff 😡😡😡
If he needs my help. I will help him. Whatever he needs. As a former dependant of a father who was in the secret service of HM government. And knowing what this government and it's corruption can be like. With also an uncle who lives in Dubai and his daughter within the conservative party in parliament. And all the corruption and tyranny and injustices within the UK Government. This soldier in my eyes deserves to be helped by the public. Problem is. Everyone will be fooled by the propaganda spewed out by new corporations... If he needs my help overcoming the government like myself. I am offering my help to him. I have very high experience and knowledge of overcoming the authorities based on counter intelligence training from the government. Thank you.
When an inncoent is termed as a Suspect....
Must be a grand son of John Law.
Police using  the army to justify their  failures LOL
all this surveillance and cameras on us and they are struggling to track him
daniel is him
Looks strinkgly similar to Gaddafi, the eyes reek of evil, that animal is not a human, but a mere monster.
Police can't even control the youth of today consideting they allowed to walk around with balaclavas on how on earth they going to catch a well trained resourcefull intelligent soldier..
Hilarious,  go on lad
When I worked in a cat c prison every vehicle was checked inside and out using mirrors to check underneath.  So he escaped due to complete lack of competence at the prison.
Support for Daniel Khalife
Distraction?
If he’s that scary soldier, I want 1 million not 20,000
*He’s helped raise awareness our tax money isn’t spent in all areas it should*
Keep banging on about him being an ex soldier as if they’re proud of it. British justice system is beyond a joke
RAMBO 😅
just because he is suspected of being a spy for Iran does not make him a terrorist, maybe thats why he was in Wandsworth and not Belmarsh, even his ex army pals rate him as not a bad guy, not violent.. I think they are blowing it all out of proportion cause of the embarrassment of the ease to get out of jail
He should be found as soon as possible.
This guy is a G
He needs to be find as soon as possible he is a danger to society
and here starts the blame game...     he sould have never been in that prison to begin with so the one to blame is the person who put him in that prison not some over worked prison guard or cook  BUT the person who put him in that jail is probably high in goverment so they will end up blaming someone else
So he's a spy for Iran?
Bigging him up, please
I wouldnt wirry too much if he was trained by british army 😂🎉
Is in Mexico now
there must be someone behind him, I believe it is planned by someone very strong. We might see him ending up in Russia or another country against the UK (who knows).
It's not van it's called class2 lorry
Fools n Horse's😂😂 G.G.Garrrrry.😂 couldn't make this one up .Coincidence maybe
Brainwashing at its best ...wake up people
No one has used the 'Colditz Spirit' phrase yet.
Good.  Run boy run.   One in the eye for the ‘Shitstem’.
relatives and fellow religious community are hiding him
I'd imagine they murdered him and concocted this story to cover up their crimes.
Now that's really important isn't it? What a waste of time and yet more money. Should bring back the death sentence.  How about reporters latching onto something that's actually relevant in today's world. Such as the growing number of deaths of autistic children. News yesterday but forgotten today. Unlike this drivel.
He’s left the country, he has my respect
that is shocking a 21 year old is making a nation look like clowns lmaoooo . the metro police are in the mud
Yeah. Something very peculiar about all this. After what they did to Julian Assange I'm not going to take their word for whatever their claims are. He was in the army, he was a computer technician. Maybe he was just a whistleblower with a lot to tell. Again - look what they did to Assange. Also - did they ever even say what 'terrorism' he was involved in? I don't believe a word of any of this and they've already proven they will throw someone in a hole for no reason.
Whos he a terrorist towards cause im confused. Shall i be scared or what? Cause at the moment i feel like I'll help him
The hunters can catch the fugitives on hunted from a shipping container in the middle of a car park but the fbi and an entire police force can’t catch this man. Fair play to him
*Us daft citz understand! TERRORIST, VERY RESOURCEFUL SOLDIER, Cat B, knew crowded & lack of officers. SO LET HIM WORK IN KITCHEN WITH🔪NEAR EXITS👏2 officers alternating & hawk his ass wouldn’t of made a huge diff! TRUTH OFFICER HELPED! Strapped on trolly no 1 saw. Got 150 officers looking for him now though. Most stupid excuse!*
He’s in Brazil sipping non Alcoholic pina coladas
LOL😂
Quite impressive tbf. Obviously dont approve of his crimes but the fact he managed to pull this of really says alot about our prisons.
Danny boy is a military veteran. He's the only survivor of his platoon and now he wanders through the United Kingdom  in search of a job. He's arrested by the arrogant sheriff of a town in the South, but he rebels against the agents' brutality and escapes into the park. Here, Danny boy utilizes his military training and manages to knock out the sheriff and the numpty cops. Finally Danny gives up to his former commander.
The search for the next Bond stops here, surely?!
Good, hope he's never caught.
Real life Rambo
I thought it was hilarious that they were trying to stop him leaving the UK! 😊
'They havnt found a trace of him'  maybe he didn't exist -lol 😂😂
Sp, what about all these people that are being sent to prison ? Surely the police arresting them and locking them up after a trial isn’t the reason ? I thought they didn’t do anything 😂
What is Happening in this Country. Does anyone that works for the Government care about and do their job properly. We also need a Death Penalty back.
this dude's eyes really look like mine,😆
The last 13 years under a tory government and everything is crippled.   Housing, education, transport, justice, healthcare and police to name a few.   Yet the government expect a thank you for a job well done.
This Daniel is like a cross between Rambo in the first Rambo movie, and Schwarzenegger in the movie titled Commando, remember how Schwarzenegger escapes from inside the aeroplane soon after takeoff? 😂
Haha ha 😂😅😢😮😊🎉❤❤❤
A man hunt?? Hes a little boy!!! Is it lancashire police looking for him????
Good luck mate hope you get away and find a way to smash this horible country up
Thinking of a movie, Now you see me
Laughing stock 😂😂😂
There's more to this story then meets the eye..
He’s in Bangladesh inn eating  dry fish. 😂😂😂
Oh really
We all know what is next perhaps its time to call  in  Sherlock Holme. Embarrassing!
Love Daniel ❤😂 proper gangster 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What are all the CCTV cameras around London used for?
Christ a terrorist. He made a few prank calls by the sounds of it. Media whipping up hysteria
I pray to Allah he's safe and he's away from the grip of your cruel democrats you dirty liers we are standing with him carry on son running don't give up
Bet hes jumped into the Iranian embassy and probably out the country by now.
Good luck Rambo
I wish the government would be as determined to stop the boats as it is to capture the lad.
media propaganda to divert our attention
Small fry this fella the barges and hotels are full of proper terrorists planning and waiting to attack the people of this country this government is bollox  dickheads from private schools making up the rules for the people who know more about life than they will ever know, spoilt little twats
& mean while behind the scenes what’s really going on is …….
The man is from royal signals,not from an infantry unit. They don't teach escape and evasion there unless you're in 264. Probably a lineman or electrian. It's like being a driver in the transport regiment(rtc) and being classed as military trained as a special forces man. This man got out because of prison staff not doing their job. If there isn't enough of them,then it's down to governments of all parties to take blame
He did a Max Cady in Cape Fear.
Bonkers Britain. "We wer So Wizzy wee wid wot wow "
I dont know enough about this case. But what i have learnt so far. He was a british soldier. The western media are the enemy of the british people. We are being invaded by africans,supported by the UK government. So excuse me if i think the British soldier could be a patriot!
Pathetic. Police do not do their jobs.
click bait
No wonder no one trust's the news anymore. Fake bombs planted and he's in a B cat. While Ronnie Biggs was in the Bell Marsh I  smell deep cover operation somewhere in a dusty country. May be wrong but that's what I'd do if I was the home office.
😂😂😂😂 It just shows how bad our government is.
I hope he hasn't headed towards Dartmoor, where  a couple of squaddies lost their automatic rifles! No, that jokes on the Army. The drivers tacho will  show the probable points of escape from underneath the vehicle.
All the police in the UK ..cannot find him or catch him...just sums up how useless the Police force  are, they certainly are not what they used to be ...first they should close the prison ... may be the concrete was crumbling and that's why he escaped. This is a serious security breach and as usual the Tories are avoiding comment ... absolutely laughable... 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🇬🇧
anakin does not like sand
Why this is a top news? What is the media want to sell us?
We must have the most amount of CCTV per square foot in the whole world, and you're telling me you can't find one with an image of this escapee???
Listening to the woke politicians he could have been hanged
I would trust Daniel Khalif one billion times more than sh*tbag sunak and his coven of hindutva-zionist terrorists.
Mr. Khalif is long gone. He is obviously a 007 genius OR he is getting a lot of help. Either way, he has richly earned his freedom by making over 150 oinkers look like total inbred idiots.
Were the staff in the kitchen men or not and the prisoner then escaped?
Huge Respect to Daniel Khalife , I hope you make it safely to Iran. May god be with you
Huge Respect to Daniel Khalife
Steal a 30p bag from Tesco and they'll catch you in a heartbeat, be a convicted terrorist you get called "resourceful" because the Police can't do their job
im sure he's no threat to the general public 😊
It's all bollocks as usual ..
He'll be about 100 yes from the prison
Useless government Richie Sunak must go his destroying this country look at a number of Nigerians are in this country
Why wasn't this nutter in the Colchester Glasshouse?
Check the mosques. Track his local Imams.
They should call maximum security pris_ns. ( o escapes )  Low security Pr_sons. ( because i escape )
Jokes police are trash
What on earth did this 21 year old kid do to deserve a nation-wide manhunt?
He's in Iran.
Extreme hide and seek hope clearly all the cameras that are used for charging people for entering comgestion zones cant even locate him
Why is he running
Prison Break 2 coming…..yaaay !
Well done to the lad 👍🏾🎉 I hope they never find him and let him be
Listen , he has been let go on purpose and right now he is being tracked to see who's who , movie in the making ,my name is bond James Bond
Plot twist, the government/military killed him so he wouldn't blab information, and made it look like he escaped!
Who let him work in the kitchen? That iis a highly trusted position given to a op!
Something just doesn't add up with this the guys left no trace what so ever and also put a convicted terrorist who under prison rules should be in a category a prison they put in a category b prison that from there own statement is pretty poor and then they take over an hour to find and stop the lorry he supposedly escaped on come on I know he was in the army but he was regular army no disrespect to those guys but he wasn't exactly sas or SBS or marines was he now who actually he even says he's even escaped on this truck apart from them and the media im no detective but something don't add up
Hes working in the laundry . They just havnt noticed 😅
never mind wandsworth, the government isn’t fit for purpose 🤮
They had him, and now they've lost him.
oh damn
Not so much who but why ? Why was he ALLOWED to escape ? Awaiting answer from our brilliant ! !  Home Office, lover of migrants.
Khaliffe was innocently imprisoned by the British , i urge every Muslim to aid this man escape the country before these British police can frame him, help him escape to Iran, he is a hero to us all??
But not really the crime of the century eh - a 21 year old ex British soldier is accused of (trying to) spy for an (enemy state) understood to be Iran who have an embassy in London? - and of plotting a (fake bomb) hoax.  (Is he possibly in the Iranian embassy?)
I take it there's no CCTV cameras in London then?
How exactly do they actually know that he strapped himself to the underside of a delivery truck???
If the last time he was spotted was by the Wandsworth roundabout he's gone out by river.. the Thames is right near by.
Very significant - a confirmed sighting 2 days ago???  🤣
I'm calling hoax!
It's time for all garbage boroughs to remove their inhumane cctv cameras. Especially Camden and Fulham sending PCNs to poor drivers for stopping or picking goods or passengers. These cctvs are waste of taxpayers money. The main objective should be catching drug dealers and criminals like the one escaped. Instead they look for soft targets ie the drivers.
The Great North Run - pre planned.
Looks like a 15 year old, what the heck?
You guys give too much credit to these foreigners.
He was a trained soldier? 😂😂😂 Thats got nothing to do with prison escapes. He escaped because the prisons security was a joke.
Good luck to him.
he has hidden on top of the tail lift under the truck as seen in the video very smart you cant see him🤣
the lifting floor at the back of the truck gives it away where he hide,when it is  in its transport position as in the video all he needs to do is go under the truck and slide on top of the floor lift nobody can see you there simple😂🙃😙
Put a reward out so someone will call out on him
With that surname thats a good english surname .?.
Instead of asking who was on duty? Maybe the politicians should be finding out who wasn't on duty?
Chris Atkins seems like someone who enjoyed his time in the cell? The system is flawed
Let's turn anything and everything into a story. We don't care for your mishaps they happen far too often. Everyone is useless here in the UK these days
Every jail in England is possible to escape from its staying out that is the hardest part
😂😂😂😂😂
Smart guy
Trained soldier 😅😂😂😂🎉😅😂
Ah the english, always good for a laugh
Tories running a very tight ship indeed
Looking more like a false flag every day .... somethings coming and he will get the blame... tbf politicians are more of a threat to the UK public !
So all the cctv that we have is useless then?
Thier are only putting in the news bc how much of this government failed this country can't stop illegall immigrants falling down schools..
My theory is he is long gone. Probably in a safe house in Tehran right now. Once this blows over he will be at the desk of one of their intelligence commands leaking stuff.
Clever lad...no way the cops are to find him..😆😆
Strange now they want the public's help! Yet Nicole bulley remember that? The public were referred to as ghouls!
His escape isn't remarkable, that is just government stupidity in expecting 25 people to do the job of 50 everytine they want to syphon money off into Tory MPs friends and families bogus businesses, his disappearance is remarkable. No doubt the cops are just buzzing around in cars. This guy will have hid in a storm drain or similar where the Police Helicopters won't see him on FLIR Cameras. 1st day on the run you would go to ground nearby as the search fans out beyond you. 2nd day, a contact with a white box van picks you up and gets you 100 miles away or more. He is already a long way away from London now maybe sleeping upstairs at a non descript Asian restaurant/takeaway, likely a seaside resort with plenty of holidaymakers to confuse the local cops. Brighton or Blackpool maybe even Barry Island ........ no sorry, he isn't yet that desperate😂.
Listen no prison let’s a inmate do roll call!! Ffs this guys a joke!
He's so hot lmao
Someone got paid and helped him . Its 2023 . Not coincidence . The boy is probably about to do his last job soon . Rip already unless they find him. Which I. Ant see . But look at the effort they putting in to find him though .. stopping the whole motorway and searching up every truck lol they know the boy is on madness . Oh well well . UK!
They keep stating his surname and wont state Daniel as it does not meet the ageanda 😂
i bet this guy on his way to iran
What an incompetent lot....starting with a prison they knew to be unfit for purpose...😂.....some senior members of their institutions must take responsibility for this hilarious occasion......just think of how competent these peoplr would be in an armed conflict....🙈
Go free!
I have a radical solution to prison overcrowding   Build more prisons
😂😂😂😂 When they were showing the clips of the escape route and the checkpoints, they should have had the benny hill music playing in the background.. Bunch of numpties.
This is an inside job and his friends are helping him!! It’s obvious!!!
Should really get the army to look for him. They're trained to be able to get away. They need people with the same knowledge he has. If he puts his training into action the police will never find him
Why is there such a furore over the escape of this prisoner? are we being given the full facts? he's apparently in prison for passing on secret information to Iran, hes not a mass murderer or a child rapist, why are they pulling out all stops to capture him? does he know something they dont want us to know about or something? just curious.
Definitely happened in the Simpsons.. sideshow Bob!!!
Hijab should be banned, criminals could hide in them
It'd giving mark ryder
where are you getting 8 hours from
The government maybe facilitated it to plant him in Iran as a double agent. That was my 1st thought. Ive probably watched to many spy films
There's an old saying that says do not fear the Lord fear your actions because they will come after you. God bless Thank you ...
He is now inside the Iranian embassy
Police don’t give up on day job
People could die because we have incompetent people not doing there jobs right
Maybe the police dont want to find him maybe theyre pretending they dont have footage🤔
This country is useless
Give him a job as counter terrorism officer.he can infiltrate the other terriste cells in the UK
Them immigrants looks after him
Be interested in the quality of the strapping equipment, and if they were already attached to the underside when the van entered the prison.
Look closer at the prison staff who were on duty at the time of escape. Daniel MUST HAVE HAD help from somebody.  The fact that he passed all the obstacles, officers, security cameras, get under a lorry, fasten himself up and escape, couldn't have happened just like that!
It’s simple use CCTV to follow the truck then you’ll find out where he got off at
So reading between the lines, the Iranian and British governments arranged a prisoner swap and Khalife was taken out of prison by MI5 onto a small plane to France and from there onward to Iran. The government are rather shy about the truth of this and so this is the cover story.
He bribes someone inside. No doubts, plus he already flew the country. If he is part of any terrorist group he doesn't need a plane to run away. The border line is not only in Dover. Kiss him goodbye. Plus... why are tubes not protected just the airports?
He's obviously f'd off back to 3rd world land never to darken our ehores again so in a way it's a result.
150 officers trying to capture 1 suspects. London hey
They will not find him, forget it.
Try the iran embassy.
I don't think Iran needs anyone to 'gather information' for them, and certainly not someone as young as this one. Oh and he looks more Afghan than Iranian.
His community is protecting him  .
Like alot of government services not fit for purpose
One man causes carnage you couldn't make it up lmao
A person that wasn't even born here trained in the British army shocking
Police is wasti g our tax money they are useless and criminals themselves.
He could be having tea with the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei this very minute. Long gone!
He's not that resourceful. The police are just that useless. Too much taking the knee and breakdancing at pride.
Chris Atkins is Matt Hancock
Hi Netflix
uk prisons are the best. you have all the time in the world to watch movie and escape. put them to work in chains and no time for ideas'.
I picked him up and dropped him off hes safe and happy dont worry he's better now he's out of prison
I didn't think he escaped from a cat a prison. Shocking that either he was helped inside or the checks weren't done or both.
Bollocks they can't find him. Probably helped him escape..
He Should be made Head of Security at M15 and Get rid of some of The Tosser's Who Run Things Now.
Man done a Michael Schofield
So he has been remanded in prison since January for an alleged crime that took place in 2021?? No wonder he escaped. He's not even a convicted criminal.
Another smokescreen just like that sub dissapearing !
Pure simple easy way all prisoners incarceration to keep population of uk 🇬🇧 safe and prisoners unable to escape is build massive prisons in the sea at least 50 miles off coastlines in uk 🇬🇧 ect because if wind turbines and oil rigs can be put up in middle of the sea miles away from any land then so should prisons so I've questioned it and I've just solved it build prisons in middle of the sea at least 50 miles off coastline and it is that easy to do if for instance all millionaires billionaires trillionaires ect ie rich to actually pay their taxes plus all top mps prime minister mayor khan ect lords lady's vicounts dukes duchesses ect all to take a wages cut and stop taking such cuts off of the unfortunately unemployed poor people pensioners disabled that would fund prisons in the sea 🌊 easily pure simple fact get it sorted and watch crimes fall massively plus actually stop ✋️ all the boats dingys asylum seekers immigration and even illegal people coming into UK that would give billions of pounds back towards sea 🌊 prisons problems solved pure and simple fact 🤞🙏👀⏰️😲🤔😡🤬
incompetence breeding incompetence for everyone to laugh at
They've let out through their gates now he's elite escape artists. The police couldn't catch a cold in the middle of winter,  there still looking for robin hood . The whole system is a joke .
if he ex army or military then I think it would be perfectly possible go out in the middle of the country or somewhere he is very experienced he could use foliage in a park or something to build a base and hide that, we used to do this making up little camo camps like that all the time when we were young kids and fairly close to the main path and it could not be seen, I was also a cadet and did that sort of thing when I was a teen and had to use cam paint on our faces and we had people looking directly at us on this little exercise and they could not see at all and I was no pro just a kid and we had adults staring  right at us, I would be very very surprised if he is in a town with cameras everywhere he would go somewhere where he has the edge.
British intelligence👮🏼‍♂️is shite.
its  a test     saying stop  rewardiong start  deporting  before there  are rivers   of  blood  brits    ar  about   at   end   of  it
Put a reward up people now days would sell there mother for a grand .   Let's face it grassing up is where the police get all there convictions.  Not police work
If birds of a feather flock together,  try looking where there's a lot of criminals, Westminster.
Make a film!!!
They can put salt on his tail now .
The police might aswell recruit him 🤣😂😂 . Hate him or love him he has style 😅🥹
Why is this the first time we have ever heard of this guy, in the media before now?
Good lad. Keep running hopefully he’s out the country all ready 🙏🏼
They never will find him, a couple of million brothers will hide him
Its no laughing matter, but feels like one....There are far too many idiotic people in high positions in this country. They'll be well educated and all the rest of it, but have virtually no COMMON SENSE. A terrorist suspect and spy in a CAT B jail....Come on!!!..Which Herbert decided that? ....He'll be in Tehran before the weekend is out.
is he a spy or a terror suspect?
So many posh people calling it a van 😂 it’s clearly a truck.
Maybe they should track the lorry journey and everytime it stopped check cameras on its route
What is london coming too the criminals are taking over how have they allowed this happen shocking
End znst trrism today.🇵🇸🇮🇷🗝️
What a fkin legend lol
Power to Iran
Bet you he crossed the river north AND he walked right by the MOD building 🤣
So prisoner escaped, everyone worried but Parliament EMPLOYEES not at work. Shame on them!
I hope he gets away
3:08 imagine living in those houses in front, knowing monsters are behind you
This guy makes Michael Scofield look like a complete novice 😂
Fantastic another independant inquiry that should sort things out
Maybe he was smuggled out as a weapon of knowledge!
Clearly there have been lapses in security checks. When it’s literally the only really feasible way to escape from prison you’d think every vehicle leaving the prison would be thoroughly inspected.
Just got the latest on hike, he’s eating 4 burger meals at Burger King while smoking a joint 😄 he also did thanks for the heat wave in England.
He had access to basic information, officers names and ranks. Since when have intelligence agencies needed individuals to do that? Any agency could have gained access to that information, he wasn’t spying for Iran.
Considering London has the most cctv cameras of any major city I’m surprised they haven’t been able to track him more than they have. He has to be getting help or lie low somewhere. Worst case scenario, he’s already left the country using fake documents.
Dude is already in Spain.
He is trained army boy he is not on the road he is on his foot somewhere in juggle doing hunting and making huts in juggle search jungle
Have their checked the greens fields areas as if he using his soldier training and he could in one of the local buildings
Daniel Khalife is the hottest terrorist I've seen.
Why have the police not checked the prison itself? Confirm the person is not dead and hiding his body somewhere.
He probably took the underground to st pancreas and got on a eurostar within that time he had
😂 always the same families.
There's more politicians and news talkers involved in this case than police itself
2:59 Matt Hancock?
Terror suspect or not… gotta give him props for escaping a prison after only being in a couple of months hahahaha FairPlay lad
Failed country.
he seems like Rambo lol
He was arrested in Downpatrick Northern Ireland
What’s this guy actually done, they’re keeping it extremely vague , if your going to distract us with another side story while this country falls apart have the decency to at least explain a story properly I think it’s what classic reporting has become - be worried, here’s why but u don’t need details
Not many people can escape prison, he has my respect
Nonsense, he's in Cuba having cocktails with Tupac and Elvis 😂. What a shambles
All this is so obvious. The secret service agency has helped him escape pretty straightforward.
A further thought is that as well as being able to see when it is safe to escape by looking out for legs of passers-by, it is quite likely the lorry was followed to scoop him up the moment he released himself. I would suggest that whether parked or on the road, it would be possible for him  to release himself, roll out between the back wheels and into a following van at traffic lights or with another vehicle dithering in front of the lorry for enough seconds for him to unstrap.  It wouldn't surprise me if right now the police are combing the route knocking on doors for CCTV images of the lorry on its round to see if any other vehicle is accompanying it discreetly.
It's a catalogue of mistakes, clearly the vehicle wasn't checked underneath in the main gate area. The escapee isn't convicted of any crimes either he's a remand prisoner,  if he was deemed to be high risk he wouldn't be working in the kitchens.
They will never find out where this boy is
He’ll be overseas now, purged up safe and sound, giving him time to change his appearance
military friends
England is such a homogeneous society it won’t be easy for someone who looks like Khalif to blend into the population.  ~British Police, 1932
I'm finding it difficult to understand why he's referred to as a terrorist. Usually terrorists murder people. More reasonable to adjust his crime of being a spy. If he hasn't actually killed anyone then he's obviously not dangerous. OK he carried out a bomb hoax and as serious as that is, that still doesn't classify him as a terrorist
This guy probably got his hand on important documents exposing crime wars indicting famous politicians
Is the justice minister also going to turn around the stone to find out who is to blame for the prison system funding cuts?
LMAO, back in the 70s my Sisters b/f used this method in a laundry bin....its nothing new, just startling "news" for snowflakes🤣at least he is easy to identify having a head shaped like a fkn Dairylea triangle😂
Matt hancock looking well
I'm not gonna lie, pretty impressive... ashame his skills are not for the greater good.
Deffo in Iran now him laughing at us
If I saw him I would just keep walking
Great video
The RNLI have probably made an exception and took one the other way.
I dont see how bombing Syrian villages while shouting HOORAH trains you how to escape prison, and avoid all CCTV in London?!
A classic case of "bolting the stable door after the horse has bolted! 😆😃😂😊😀
Doubt he got far probably still hiding in Wandsworth.
It is quite easy to reduce crime if we adopt techniques from other countries
They probably killed him accidentally and just made a story he escaped without a trace of CCTV evidence to prove otherwise. Why can’t they show a video evidence,  They will in the future with probably a actor playing a escape like the dodgy government does
It's not a van it's a lorry there is a different in size and these government officials and army officials don't have a clue all soldiers should be vetted this is why things like this happen
I think this solder knows some information about MP  As he is high in tech  So next game start call Rambo 3
HMP Wandsworth is a disgrace. It is plagued with vermin that have absolute freedom of movement in this establishment. The prisoners are forced to eat food contaminated with rat droppings and urine. What on earth are the prison authorities doing about it? How long has this iniquity been covered up? Daniel Khalife is better off having escaped from this hell-hole.
Hes hardly ex SAS or equivalent...  The police numbers are cut to the bone, the country is destroyed almost...  Can't be hard to outwit them.
I live right close to this prison
Well if he's  been missing for eight hours that's enough time for him to flee the country but not in his chef's  uniform  somebody must be helping him what a great film  this would make are you listening  netflix 😊
Prison security that helped him will have a nicer retirement  No way can you do it with out a lot of help That boy in Abu Dhabi sipping ice tea saying bismillah
I wonder if Iran is helping him ??? This was well planned if prisoners  are allowed mobile anything is  possible😮
Them saying hes a trained soldier and saying he's a terror suspect could just be a cover up for something else he did and they've chucked him in prison for it so i very much doubt he was or is a terror suspect and therefore why he decided to escape i personally think its part of a wider scheme of things
He will probably be on the next channel dinghy and put in a lovely hotel right under our noses and live a happy life on benefits courtesy of the gear british tax payer!!
This will definitely justify putting the whole country into lockdown. What a perfect opportunity to introduce more draconian rules.
Daniel!!!! Pls name him as his first name…
He long gone over to France by now tat ta Britain
That’s a big van 😂😂
Can we start the revolution please
Lol
He’s not even in this country now
Wandsworth prison is an Islamic recruitment ground like all the other prisons across the country.
It’s a testament to how entrenched the militant Islamic groups have control over the capital, Birmingham and greater Manchester. He will be in on of the many many government funded mosques that our dotted around our Christian country.
Can’t wait to watch a film about this
150 officers  . and the whole country,.…  and he still hasn’t been caught 😂
How do they know he was strapped under a vehicle if he has disappeared..🤔
Probably set up deliberately to bring in some new law. Nonsense
Leave man alone
The prison services are under pressure, lack of funding, lack off prison staff ,this government are to blame
Inside job
It’s an embarrassment to the uk government on the lack of protecting the people of the uk there letting god knows how many in via boats a day the country is weak and crumbling
The incompetence of the British police 😂
Sorry this is hilarious and the commentary from the news reporter. 😂😂
Inside job mate
Terror "Suspect" ... what is not getting reported that should be?
Remember, if you saw him, no you didnt
Hoax caller. He's no Brendan Hughes. Looking like a storm in a teacup, mountain out of a molehill.
Probably out of the uk by now
I Believe  he has now disguised  himself  as a lady Either way military  training  he has an advantage 😉 They won't catch  him. Not gonna lie Smart Getaway. 😊
Is he related to Wiz Khalif a
One job you had, one job. 🤦‍♀️
We  saw him in reading..with black boi naithen
He will be out the city. Probably in the country some where. If he has any training as a soldier he can survive rurally. Sick of Tories blaming staff. They cut budgets. Its their fault
That's a soldier trained to go through an eye of a needle to escape captivity let alone the underside of a lorry, don't make sense 7 staff against 1000 prisoners.
I sort of feel like there is a film to be made about this.
He’s probably clinging to the underside of a lorry right now, on his way to Europe 🤣  At least the way he’s travelling means he won’t have any Ulez fines
That is a lorry.....not a van ....🤦🏻‍♂️
Cant stop laughing 😂
Complete legend 👏, hope you have a nice long spell on the run,never let them know your next move,run little man run
Everybody needs to be investigating including the ministry and the department of defense. Don't use overworked and underpaid staff members as a scapegoat. If they were given the tools to do their thoroughly,they would.
Anything to distract from Birmingham
He’s the only one on the boat leaving the country 🤣
never thought media would compliment a known terrorist
He's gonna be used as a future false flag attacker
Yet another representative of the "peaceful religion" of islam terrorizing the rest of us.
Him and Grouty tried to organise a football match, prison team v celebrity 11, but the celebs were too busy dancing and going on dates 😂😂😂😂
lgbt police are too busy arresting people for 1g of weed
This whole thing stinks to high heaven
its Brooklyn Beckham lol
That's a soldier trained to escape captivity he deserves a medal.
Who needs Netflix when you've got this!
Hope he's out of country he should be its easy to get in to  England 😂😂😂
Instead of setting the police the task to collect this terrorist why don't we use our special forces that's what we train them for surely . The money we're spending on catching this little terrorist  all the delays & chaos.
What accent does this man speak with
So this image is from a CCTV , are they trying to claim there’s no footage at all of him , in London ? Something is off .
The media are making out that because he was “military trained” that he’s somehow a cross between James Bond and someone from the SAS.  The guys a bleep from the Signals not something from a movie or a book.   The media are a joke with all their fantasist BS.     That being said, he’s quite clearly getting help.  Or he’d have been caught already.
Funny how the prisoner becomes "resourceful" when the police can't do there job😂
One can await the obligatory lessons learned mantra, with bated breath. Meanwhile he lays low in some sharia friendly ghetto; wearing robes and throwing away the razor. He will have many accomplices who can facilitate any atrocity that may ensue. Staff inside Wandsworth  were probably party to the flight. It is extraordinary, in such a surveillance rich land, that he has not been spotted, particularly when they changed vehicles.
I'm a girl, and english is not my first language, but even I can tell it's called a lorry, not a van
Good.  Run. Man’s praying for you
Conservative party are to blame for this imo
‘Nationwide manhunt’ ? Nonsense….I haven’t seen a policeman or police car for months and months.
He will be hidden in the vast numbers of communities of his own persuasion all living lives under the radar of us Brits
dum ass the police they underestimate the army train they got no chance of catching him they couldn't catch me well i was walking under  the city camera`s  and still could not best me back home its funny this was the Aberdeen Scottish police lol never mine England you need very train army force of 6 men`s to hunt him down
Accused of gathering information for Iran? Obama sent Iran 1.7 Billion dollars as president and still walks free
I cant wait for Infographic to post about this in a few years captioning it "Britains Wildest Modern Prison Break"
so track the van from wandsworth via cctv, ulez, conjestion charge, speed cameras etc and see where he got off. jeez not rocket science
I served 26 years in the military and was never trained to escape prisons so media waffle
Poor lorry drivers are suffering because of there mistakes
He is good at evasion tbf.
Stinks of Poxy Patel and Tavistock
If the budget cuts are that bad that the prison is leaving it to the prisoners! to do security checks, my goodness, the UK is going down the pan. That prisoner has been planning his escape for a long time, he knew the gaps in the security, now they're trying to resign us and resolve themselves to the fact that they have no chance of finding him, based off of his injunuity as a former soldier.
😂 our Goverment
With out doubt a in side job.. Some one has been paid off to turn a blind eye... A mate who has just come out of prison there are drugs galore in side.. HOW... Mobile phones. At a high price.. Booze... And prison a deterant yeh right.. 😎
He's got a foreign name. Where's he from
He's gone already bunch of clowns he obviously had help outside
Some things, just don't pass the smell test, and this is one of those things.
They know how to make a monkey of themselves.
when CORRUPTION is you're agenda Money is your driving force!... British Government!.....
Funny how they can do extra intervention for one man. But can’t do this with the channel crossings. Nothing is fit for purpose in this country anymore. The justice secretary should be asking these questions to his own.
Government: "if we keep this at the top of the news agenda hopefully the schools concrete problem will disappear and we can get the rebuild contracts out to our mates in the construction industry without any scrutiny"
It's Baby faced finlayson, incarnate . He works for the Beano and lives in Dundee. What more do the British authorities need to know?
The fact he’s gone untraced is quite impressive, in the middle of no where with no money to attempt to use transport and has clearly stayed off the roads, deffo in some farmers wellie bin riding this out.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Were the prison security personnel provided by Sodexo?
I don’t know but it’s seems every often a shocking news created for people to keep connect with news bussiness 😅
He’s gone and fair play to the lad. Made the uk security measures looks a bit silly really. And from his photos he looks like he was only a crow bag anyway
Remember officer Norberg from The naked gun , strapped himself under a van , he ended up murdering his wife or something.
As soon as I see Martin Brunt involved for Sky News I automatically think bullshit.
Personally I'm quite impressed by how long he's managed so far for such a young chap, who is clearly impressionable and needs a good mentor in his life. So much young men going to waste because older generations can't step up or don't want to because they're over-worked themselves and cut off from the young boy who once had dreams
Unfit - not enough mobiles phones, gaming, personal tvs, conjugal rights visits! 😂
He’s in Iran by now laughing at your ass of a country. Clowns still searching around London 🤦
If he is suspected of providing info to Iran. I wouldnt be surprised if hes got an Iranian contact that has picked him up and now keeping him hidden. What a fuckin show!
It’s someone else’s training that got him out! And innocent until proven guilty 😊
What sort of terrorist is he? Shouldn’t we need to know?
I've done many years many diff jails  everytime a lorry a prison bus ect goes threw they normally ha ethe dog and mirrors on sticks to look under.  Bit fishy hey. To be fair haha happy days 😊  glad for him he mugged the system haha the 1 we pay hard earned tax money for well contribute haha its disgusting. There be a pen pusher upset and getting it in the kneck from all angles. And that makes me 😂😂😂😂😂
UK army are terrorists or are you forgetting about all the people you said were "holding a gun" while you blew them up?
Why does this guy look like an AI render...
Confirmed no real news then.
😂😂😂😂😂
Personally I believe the staff assisting this escape were driven by ideology not corruption. British systems have been infiltrated right across the board over the years, from the security services, our armed forces, the Police/legal system, politicians down to support services…. a “soft” infiltration made sooo much easier recently by “Diversity & Inclusion” policies throughout our institutions. Our enemies are fully aware of the advantages of the current wave of progressive left-leaning culture sweeping the West and are taking full advantage of this in their strategic overseas intelligence projects knowing very few in the West would critique or challenge such institutional change for fear of being branded racist, Islamophobic etc. In short .. The chickens are coming home to roost 😞 Things are far, far too deep to be fixed now.
Iranian spy. Simple escape and shipped to Iran.
Obviously a danger to the establishment, but not to us ?
He’ll likely be greeted at Tehran airport soon with a welcome handshake from Grand Ayatollah.
Easy to track a person through scrubs than through the concrete jungle, spent years tracking rabbits trails
A large white bubble was seen along the beach at Portmeirion heading towards The Village - I am not a number, I am a free man!
He moving like a Romanian 😂😂😂
He look dead to me. I would say you have nothing to be concerned about but keep looking.
Did someone say strap onnn😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Media calling a HGV a van is the show of their dumbness.
Might not have been caught , because , looking at the Ethnic make-up of the Home Office , He is getting Help and Assistance .
Funny ,we let hundreds of possible terrorist in every day across the channel but as soon as one escapes prison a nationwide hunt gets underway.
How many other Spies/terrorists have been allowed into the Military?? Background checks mustn't be a thing anymore. 🤷
What if he has not escaped and is still in wormwood scrubs
He was a scaly back lizard not a ninja in the black arts of Special forces operations this is sheer incompetence on the police and prison service. Using laughable military training to justify his escape. Get a grip
Criminals chasing criminals.
Hes in Syria as we speak
It is Russians - blame them 😅
Obviously the authorities did not want him in court as too much dirt would fly around.
They'll find him in Zihuatanejo
Daniel i salute you
British army has produced a Rambo whom they cannot outwit snd outperform
Must be in hiding in the fields or something, camouflaged!
Definitely paid off
You can't keep a good Man down very simple right under there noses
led the lad be
was he S.A.S. trained or something? quick lets cover up under staffed uk jails
Going through the comments people support the young man over the government Those in government are the global global terrorist working for the WEF the WHO and the UN Under Klaus Schwab's rules
The UK prison system is first of all a joke with their sentences.
I suppose you cannot do a background check on armed forces personal because of all these minority rights issues....If a man soldier wants to wear a dress then a terrorist can freely become a soldier.
If I understand correctly.  He has Not Been convicted of anything.  Technically he was still an innocent man. Imagine if his  FAKE BOMB (sounds like a prank) & him, BREAKING THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT,sounds like a made up opinion on actual facts. Could easily turn out to be fake/made up nonsense/stich up job to get rid of him just incase he’s not loyal. Imagine if this was a Julian Assange escape story.  A GREAT NEWS STORY but the charges on him sounded largely made up anyway and I would like to hear this soldiers side of the story because I think it will be very interesting.
ITV and the media actually positively praising a terrorist. Hmm interesting, I wonder if he looked a little different they would they still run with the narrative of the "AMAZING ESCAPE OF THE RESOURCEFUL terrorist".
Hes in someones backgarden shed.
The Death Penalty would sort out the overcrowding problem and the tax bill for keeping the public safe would be reduced. Win/Win.
Hmmm i dunno what it is but something about this glows in the dark.
I await with bated breath the next new fear porn
Ha ha ha ha ha....
Lol......lets lockdown after ther prisoner has escaped!! 😂😂😂👍
The fact that he was not in Belmarsh tells me that it was an inside job with government support. I am just waiting for billions of pounds to be poured into the private prison system because the HMP system isn't now good enough. Just imagine how many houses/apartments you can build on the site of Wandsworth Prison, once it is closed down.
Just leave him alone, he's out now so just forget about him.
How do they know someone is missing with a short time notice!?
Gillian would you and Tory buddies kindly sort this one. Or are still stuck in a children school
Cannot wait for the documentary. There is a part of me that wants him to disappear for good.
ITV NEWS...ISNT NEWS
Country is a laughing Stock he will be sheltered in one of our jihadi no go zones so anywhere in the country really 😂😂
There is always more truth behind. MIDIA IS A LIERS, GOVERNMENT ARE LIERS...WE DONT TRUST ARMY .
Police :  I will look for you, I will find you, and I will put you back inside.              Daniel : good luck
Comical.  Can't keep them out can't keep them in . Officers dibble meets the cast of porridge.
No mention of his ethnicity. Background, heritage?
Inside job?
That’s what happens when you cut funding on the things that directly affects the public so throwing billions at the fuckin ukraine is affordable
Think matey nearly forgot his lines towards the end. It's okay mate noone noticed
Maybe he5 5till in5ide thry havent got enough 5taff to br 5ure.
Looking for one man and thousands sail in with a warm welcome Four cough  It's planned
He's well gone . .
Good luck Danny! Hope he makes it through
Maybe he5 off to give that information to Iran and will be back.
This highlights the state of the prison and prison system and it can be laid at the feet of the Tory party and one man in particular Chris Grayling the most useless stupid minister ever
Catch me if you can 😂
What has he done to be classed as a terrorist.
What makes me laugh is that he was in one of the most secure prisons in the world in Belmarsh where they keep the most high profile terror suspects but yet they transfer him to Wandsworth🤔🙄🥴
It's that important empty parliament
Distraction for the public 👀 inside job for sure.
Iran ha5 never looked 5o good to him. Loooool.
He has dressed as a trans and long gone. All he needed was a false passport, and you can get them as easy as 123
I ran ha5 never looked 5o good. Loooool'
LOOOOOL!.
Excuses why they calling him former soldier..go all out for him bring down his family crush his religion blame everyone associated him string up his lived ones ..dont know why they still saying former soldier
He is so smart 😮. He had it planned
Cheering on this guy hope he makes it out the country 👏
Bet he has the adrenaline rush of his life right now. On the run with a whole nation hunting him but still going strong 😂 hes probably chilling in iran
THEY SEEK HIM ~~~ HERE THEY SEEK HIM ~~~ THERE IN A TOTAL BLIND PANIC THEY SEEK KHALIFE MOST EVERYWHERE ~~~~~~~~ IS HE STILL DRESSED AS A CHEF ? WELL ~~~~~~~ WHO CAN TELL IT SEEMS KHALIFE IS MORE ELUSIVE THAN THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL!!!
Bring MI6 to assist. 😂😂😂
What happened to the trillions camera’s everywhere ?! Probably inside job
Cant believe theyre just calling Chris Atkins a "former inmate" 😂  The guys a journalist, author, and was taken down in the tax wars as a token face. His book about his time in Wandsworth is brilliant. Check it out! 😊
Surely it would make sense to involve MP's?
I saw him in Iran
UK and US having similar stories of prison breaks at the same time😂
Something else is happening here there is no way they haven't caught him, haven't they watch the hunted series 😅
Blaming everybody and everything but the person checking the vehicles leaving.

Why do I feel as though the guy that escaped didn’t do anything wrong?
I’m sure I literally saw this person like 10 mins ago
UK muslim population = 5%. UK muslim prison population = 16% and rising at an alarming rate. Recent scary ONS statistic: BAME UK prison population is now over 50%
Iran intelligence works not bad to be honest...
If he had posted a twitter racial remark he would have been arrested within 20 minutes.
Not a problem, plod say the military trained terrorist is not considered dangerous
This would actually be laughable if it wasn’t so serious. Bad enough that he managed to escape in the first place, but when you consider that we are admitting thousands of young men of a similar age into the country every day who have crossed the channel, with absolutely no idea who they are or where they come from, it makes this look like a joke.
Go on lad 👍 All the way to Russia 👍.   Truly amazing how many coppers are assigned to the one man when the MET is full of rapists and Murderers 👍.  Free Julian Assange 👍
Voting for Labour as always
That former prisoner whi was interviewed ticking prisoners names off aka wanna be screw jailed off and doing the screws job 😂😂😂😂 woudnt dare mate
Hahahahahahaha
The British El chapo 😂😂
Well he wouldn't be leaving the country on a rubber dinghy, only rubber dinghy's come to Britain, not go....
How difficult is it! 2 strap oneself 2 the underside of a lorry? People go missing & r never found!  Guidance & Protection  Mannerz & Respect!!
Don’t they put mirrors under all vehicles leaving the prison???.?
Not fit for purpose, but there still happy to throw people in there. Joke
I hope he stays alive and well, bless his heart!!! I didn't know he was a soldier. I just hope he stays alive because I am worried for his health and safety. He is only human!
I would say HM Wandsworth’s prison officers know for corruption for long time, so I blame them
On one hand he is an international spy, on the other, he is hoax bomber. It does not compute. Most likely he is a silly and hot headed young man the establishment decided to throw the book at for his stupid antics.
He will go straight to France then come back on a boat and given a free house.  What a story for the grandchildren!.
Welcome to soft Britain 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hopefully this will show the country how useless our police really are
This story is becoming ridiculous. The kid is being used as some scapegoat and they are desperate to make out he’s some master terrorist. I wonder what else they are trying to cover up.
Currently being harboured & transported by those sympathetic to his goals, all from in & around Londonistan. If this farce doesn’t speak to the diminishing of our once greet nation, nothing will.
on a dinghy to calais 🥸
Wandsworth andxwalton both need fully shutting disfusting places for inmates
Hes already out the country i bet
How did this happen??? Inside job
We should remember that he hasn't been convicted of anything. Innocent until proven guilty. If I were him, I wouldn't trust the legal system to give me a fair trial so I can't blame him for escaping.
Bring back the death penalty, clear the prison.
Anyone else think the ex prisoner interviewed sounded and looked like Matt Hancock ?
And very suspicious.. It is virtually impossible to escape a cat B jail without inside help. And it is very suspicious why a terroist remand prisoner was put in a cat B (rather than at cat A Belmarsh) and then given a coveted kitchen prison job. Someone high up as set this up, it has spooks fingerprints all over it. Probably spooks want him to get back to Iran to run him as a double agent.
He's ex military he will know how to go to ground and disappear
There aren't foreigners in german,French, croatian,serbian army,why do we have so many foreigners on british army mental
Its time to stop putting foreigners with foreign names in our army
"khalife" says it all
Hes called iran spy now, yesterday leftys were calling him british
🇬🇧 *13 YEARS OF TORY RULE, EH?* 🇬🇧
It's like a scene from the old TV series Porridge. How in real life can someone just escape so easily. I thought escape required tunnels or shapeshifting.
This young man can do mission impossible.
He's not even a terrorist and not even been convicted of an offense.
I like how their argument is budget but I've worked in places with low budget great training and places with great budgets and poor training depends on the trainer
He’s long gone ,,out of the country and gone
Has anyone thought to go ask the Iranian Embassy ? He’ll be found wearing a burka as a wife of a diplomat and  heading for Heathrow with diplomatic ID
If hes abe to escape in such a sophisticated manner hes probably out of the country by now
Can we all just say that he was in a prison for being accused of something, not convicted, and very likely faces life imprisonment on very flimsy and circumstantial evidence
I bet he never escaped.. hes prob still in the shower 🚿 your do anything not to go bk in the cell 🤣
He wasn't ever strapped to the bottom of that van. It's not his training that's got him out of prison - it's someone elses.
Inside job 😅😅😅
He works in the kitchens because he was incense.
Ingenuity of the ex soldier or  incompetence of the met.
Good luck, Lad! Head for Morocco I'd say o7
Gotta love the Tories!! This country is a joke!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He’s not black so I don’t really care if they find him
Fact check..That’s a lorry 🤦🏻‍♂️🤪 why the police are bothering we’re letting unknown people swarm this country at the southern border!! What a joke.
If only they spend so much attention on him like they spend on Julian Assange and other people exposing government crimes😅
Aww he won’t do any harm. “The one that got away” I mean. Mad props to Khalif. UK absolutely sucks. Just goes to show the police what the f to do. They are always unprepared and are always reactionary
James Bond special agent in the making. Head hunted and helped along by MI6
Have you checked Wetherspoons?
All I see is a crow the only pictures were him in basic training 😂 he's barely trained, we need to know more information like what regiment was he part of how long did he serve before getting thrown in there otherwise he's just a crow still
إيران السباب في تدمير اليمن كلاب 🐕
They are readying for a terrorist attack mark my words. This reminds me of the Boston marathon.
I hope he gets away tbf
We used to be such a great country.. We now are consistently a pathetic joke. I'm ashamed to be British.
He’s got a job as a Bt reprobate subcontractor… and he’s on his way to the top !!!  Think we better vote for him 😅
Budget cuts says it all.
942,562 CCTV cameras in London, add to that cameras in cars, buses, motorbike and cycle gopro's. Not to forget around 9,425,622 mobile phones. Nobody has seen him... right 🤔
jason bourne is alive in london ,,,no sightings because there are no cameras in london  wandsworth putney and beyond
I have read some really stupid comments on this escape from prison and it's not funny either.. being in the military, the army are specially trained all situations they come across. They can change their appearance and think outside of the box to avoid capture from the enemy. For all you know this was most probably planned.  Military skills are very good to blend in with people and all surroundings and are trained to kill in order to survive. If he does make it across sea or air , then good luck to him.
What a brave and intelligent guy he is to have skipped from such a high profile prison. Hats off to his audacity
hm
well honestly that's impressive and he must think of himself as innocent to go that far~  when it comes to military law it can be a difficult area to deal with.
All lies
Fake News
Where is cctv when you need it😂😂😂😂😂
The MoD shifting blame onto the Prison Service I see..
pwahahaha embarrassing for wano and the met😂😂😂
Independent investigation- other words cover up
There’s something so strange about this story… can’t put my finger on it but definitely more to it
Inside job. Guaranteed
Ever thought to check the sewers ? Want to hide from everyone and everything, cameras etc .... Think about it
Your going to fix that rat that's what your going to do
is it ?
That’s a big lie coz over 50 people reported sightings and the police done nothing
the "former prisoner" has never been in prison before lol
What did he do in the army?  What was his rank?  How was he accepted in the army?
There's a rat in my kitchen and what am I gonna do
Straps didn't appear from nowhere. Why were security cameras not recording?  L He's pretty and slim under a Burma nobody will recognise him.. Lorry was stopped in Putney, close to the river.
what are you talking about i live in Hastings UK ~~i was on the beach yesterday with a load of Ukrainian girls drinking booze having a great time on benefits living in great accomadation well fed laughing thier heads of ~~dont seem to like they come from a worn torn country
A terrorist uses real bombs, didnt he just put a couple of wires on some lynx cans? Also how does he get a job in the kitchens, when potentially a high risk person? More likely  he was involved sending information to countries which means he had access to sensitive files possibly although what his role was in the army i dont know, he could of only been 18 at the time it doesn’t add up this story! Plus cctv footage and mirror checks under vans before leaving! More to this than were told or bs
I'm sorry but in what world does fact he's military trained create an excuse for the allowance of his escape. he's trained to save and put people away like all of them, he is not trained to break out of a whole jail, which might I add is full of guards and officers.
Has anyone called Steve McQueen and Dierdre Rashid yet to ask for their expertise?
Keep on running,he deserves to go free.just for the escape itself.
Good luck to him he seen a opportunity and took it .
ima be real if you escape you should be free - like fair play you beat the game
Deliver you if you get the irony x
He's obviously being helped if he has not been found yet.
Now is the time for them to remake the professionals, this would make a fantastic first episode
He took the one way ticket to pluto 😅😂😂
If hes got sense he probably half way in another country by now hed escape illegally
Scotland Yard have got him.
I find it funny that the UK is the top country when it comes to surveillance yet there has been no confirmed sightings on any security cameras yet.... incredible! 🤔
That’s what you get for taking in foreigners into the British army.. Their allegiances will never be to our “king and country”
Incompetence at it's best
Anyone notice they keep using his second name alongside the word terrorist, Daniel doesn't sound so good does it?
Why are all his pictures thirst trap pictures??😂😂 I can't take it seriously-
what narrative are the media pushing for us to believe now. For all we know he had help from higher-ups to get out for unbeknown reasons....information he might have known that could be seriously dangerous to the government etc is he alive or actually being kept in an off-grid top sercurity blacksite place being interrogated. Or are we to believe the narrative that he "just got lucky"!!
Well trained ? That’s 20 years in the navy / army not 2 years well trained lol
*Another one who did not exist...just like the nurse baby killer who did not turn up to court, who all so did not exist.... WAKE UP PEOPLE THE MEDIA IS PLAYING YOU. sucking your emotional energy.*  Maybe they both are hiding in the covid school concrete.
He had some help from somewhere; someone was waiting for him outside. The first day is essential, and the first 4 to 8 hours are crucial.  Seems like an escape plot!   But I’m worried that those people who helped him to escape.. going to kill him.
Isn’t it obvious that he had help❓ And also help on the outside.   He’s probably sunning himself in the Caribbean 🏝️
Time for a reality check. So the police are astonished that they have not had one sighting of him by anyone and that he's vanished..  DUH!  He strapped himself under a delivery truck. Does that not figure? From under a deliver truck nobody can see him but he can see if anyone is near or not so he gets down and when there are no legs in sight in a particular direction he rolls out from under the vehicle, takes off his outerwear rolls it up and strolls off carrying it to a safe place to dump it.on the way to wherever he is going.  But are the police really telling the truth? How do they know to blockade Dover and not other ports? Why would they waste 150 officers on a dead end.
ITV News has already convicted this man.
The last I heard...  he slipped inside Sadiq Khan's back door!
He's probably already found his way to Dover and mingled with the many boat people coming ashore. We're probably still paying for his bed and board in an asylum seeker hotel.
Staff is mane gate mostly off useless really I'm been army many years first I'm working prison absolutely main gate staff useless lazy any inmates can escape so simple this is England can happen most of really lazy
Is that him dressed as woman in clip?
He'll be holding a press conference from Tehran very soon.
At this point, we might as well just open up all the prisons for the prisoners
Welldone geezer. We all love an underdog. Run Danny run. 😂😂😂
he used some james bond style gadgets to escape 😂😂😂 legend
Wait, that's the guy I saw living at me friends neighbour.   Holborn Towers - Leeds
All that is needed is to check on cameras before anything thing leave the premises even inserts can be seen this are failure on cameras operators maybe inside jobs who knows.
W DANIEL KHALIFE
Man copied his escape plan from a movie lol
Khalife
Wonder where the food truck dropped him off and with all the cctv around the UK and still no sightings of him . But,Strange that but cctv notices a shoplifter or if you've no documents for your car or if your going a few mile over the speed limit etc etc
Most of the comments on here are how it happened and blaming it being an inside job and taking the mickey out officers.   1 - Prisons have a high turnover of staff because no one wants to do the job. in fact 99.99% of police officers say that they couldn't do it which just shows how challenging the job can be  2 - people don't want to do the job as it can be dangerous at times and due to the over protections of prisoners where they can actually lie, an officer can lose their job as the jail will simply throw them under the bus  3 - the salary of the officers for what they do is rubbish and most of the time the jail is run on good will meaning you have officers doing double/treble shifts back to back so that the jail can function and thats even when considering that the pension of a prison officer is also rubbish now whereas back in the old days 1986 or prior, they forced out at 50-55 years old and retired.  4 - with the changing of the rules making working for the prison service even more rubbish, the older experienced staff hired prior to 2000, are leaving/retiring and with the younger generation rightly wanting a life without being a slave or working to live, either dont join or leave within a few months  5 - officers are unable to do anything even if the prisoner is high on drugs and are forced to make medical decisions and when the person dies for taking drugs which are too strong for them, the officers get thrown under the bus and then have to deal with being in court to answer for something which the HMP have made easier for people to use drugs without the consequences as an officer will always be blamed.  6 - the question i would be asking, how understaffed the Wandsworth was on the day the chap absconded ? because that where the answer will be otherwise the governor of the prison will make sure that someone of the bottom of the pay scale take the fall for it and sacked from the post.
The staff must not get paid enough😂😂
He probs still strapped to the bottom of the food truck and probs booked a room in a hotel ready to sail away on a dingy as you come in on a dingy and can book a room
in amongst busy traffic he could of dropped down off the first lorry and another lorry (the hired help maybe) drove over the top of him, he reattaches and they drive off somewhere else.
Should of used mirrors under van or camera sensors prison service just pocket all the money governess rich life style
The same method of escape has been used in prisons several times . Is he dangerous or just a bit of a daft I dont know . Only time will tell
Gone out to the chippy again ay he 😅
He'll have made a hammock style strap to hook under the lorry
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂this is very very very bad in UK they are too Somll I SK don't like it's this is not yours for Schools Children's OK and MAM Sweet mother RIP DAD family's members home 🏡🏡 too form CALSSY lady Queen Sophie kyerematen good woman from Ghana bay for now Boold of Jesus Christ Cover U all OK 🌐🗺️ OK
Wonder if he got a uba  😅
Pink pantha 😂😂😂
He's highly generic-looking. It wouldn't take much to blend in or to dramatically change his appearance.
He has escaped to a hostile nation  embassy like that swedish fella in some latin American embassy in lundon a few years ago.
News reporter)  There  has been no sighting of this person.  That's probably because nobody has seen him.
Why did the  prison 🚚 🌳 🏡 🪰 🇮🇷  ? 😂😂
This country is falling apart. Is there any part of public infrastructure that is still functioning with stability? Not even the prisons can cope any more. End Tory incompetence.
something out of james bond
This is a distraction.
I just pray that these man will change his ways and realize the things he has done and settle in a place where he can just live in Peace. But I guess that's up to him... But with the tech today I'm not sure if he can do that. Sooner or later he will be found.
They can fine someone for driving in a bus lane, in a congestion zone, but they can’t find a convicted terrorist..😂 Just goes to show what this country is all about!!
Gone to ground with his mates  in (at a guess) the Muslim community?
He is probably reading the comments  you noooo 🤔
He just looks like any young lad.  For that reason, I'm not surprised no-one noticed him, although how he rolled out from under the lorry and wasn't seen at all in busy traffic is a mystery/very clever.
2:50 Former Wandsworth inmate Chris Atkins, not gonna lie I thought that was Matt Hancock 🤣🤣🤣
They seek him here, they seek him there - he is where they have already looked, but missed him?
If he was working for Iran then surely he’s in the Iranian embassy 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤔🤔
Well trained soldier, The Great British amry...Iraq, 8 years...Afgan, 20...
This has to be the most bs news story for well over... well, it must be a week at least.
Free Deirdre!
If only we had 5g up and running, huh! 🤦‍♀️ I can see it coming
Oh look how many hard working politicians were in Parliament!
Probably went to Dover  claimed asylum watching his mugshot on tv from the comfort of his hotel room knowing he'll have two years before he's even asked any questions from the home office 😅😅😅😅
No cctv material? Surprising that there’s not one cctv footage showing where this lorry went. 🤔  seems like a distraction tbh
i thought the news said he wasnt a threat and he only made fake bombs something sounds fishy
What in the Hideo Kojima is going on in there?
bidfood lmfaooo thats who i last worked for
Boring distractions I think the real terrorists using 💉 and 💊 to kill off hundreds of thousands of British Citizens in our hospitals are much more serious and a present danger than this useless little twerp who has absolutely NO RESOURCES.  Sorry to speak truth.. I know you all hate it
Well , it's a soldiers duty to escape..... and apparently , he has !!  .... Now it looks like the 'authorities' are flopping around like fish out of water..... wonderful !  ;-)
Why is he called terrorist? Is he convicted yet? Why was he prisoner for? And it could be another story to distract us 😮
He's clearly watched rambo and Jason bourne 😅
Catch me if you can
the government are planning something and they need a scapegoat, someone to blame after whatever it is they have planned, terror suspects don't just walk out of prison without a trace, they are either let out to perform a job or they are let out so they can take the blame for the job, i think he's going to be made into a patsy like lee harvey oswald.
he's in the iranian embassy
So glad to see the health secretary did a bit of porridge.
Great distraction from the real stories news channels should be highlighting
Customs at Dover are not going to catch him 1000s just walk in on the beach's and they do nothing ,He's home free ...
Hes probably in the cafe opposite scotland yard
Need to look into his story why they labelled him a terrorist without evidence
21 yr old fools the British Security.
does itv news not know the difference between a van and a truck?
Mmmmm ,very suspicious escape!
Chronic Tory underfunding, every public service is breaking apart at the seams, almost as if this is by design to let some Tory donor muscle in on the prisons contract.
So, he's a suspect.  He's not been convicted?
I heard from a prison officer, that he was dressed as a jar of mayonnaise.
The sad joke that is britainistan. 🤡 country
the lorry should never even have been inside the compound , could have been risked stolen or like this attached underneath, the UK is so stupid ...
Bro pulled that movie prison escape 💀💀💀
He is not going to go convental, into the water quickest way out no checks on canals or rivers  or he is gone to ground for a while.! Or is it a reverse espionage punt by m15?
He’ll have made it to his Safe House, now his friends & sympathisers will shelter, lie & shield him. He might have already escaped the UK using his real Passport.
Don’t journalists know the difference between a van and a lorry?!
If he's a resourceful young man who wants to remain free, then he'll head to a gay pub or village and do rent. Hope they catch him soon.
This is the making of a Bond Villain.
It's actually comical how they show the route of the truck touching a road called Smugglers Way. A stones throw away from the river, a national express depot and a major railway junction. The guy is long gone
If they say he used a net to suspend himself under the van? If So then that net will make him invisible in broad daylight, He will easily camouflage with foliage and rest through the day and will move through the night early morning.
This guy needs to stop doing whatever he’s doing. So difficult to listen to.
This could be thrown under the carpet until something new happens or this can affect England in a way
“Britain: the land of embarrassment and breakfast.” 😂
my guy pulled a michael scofield
Go son go!
so many lorries on the motorway, all transporting absolute junk while polluting the air.
Any cctv?
1:18 at least Batman is on the hunt
he could have transitioned since escaping. didn't think of that, did you?
I think sideshow bob gave him the idea
Psyop!
Oh my.
He is probably hiding in the Iranian Embassy or possibly hiding somewhere
It’s Daniel Howell
2:05 2:24
They seek him here, they seek him there Those Policeman seek him everywhere Is he in Heaven or is he in Hell? That damned elusive SH_AAA_DOW
Bloody big van that.... It's a class 2 HGV 18 tonne vehicle I used to work for the same company bloody van
schools problem
There was no sightings of him escaping a supposedly high security prision theres not going to be many of him now he's out of it 😂
Where is sadiq khan?
maybe the issue was they were looking for a van and he was strapped to what looks more like a truck!🤔
or it might be a distraction from the schools scandal
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 join the Taliban in Afghanistan Hahaha bullshit
hes in the iranian embassy
he might be military trained but i think thats an excuse to avoid why the prison security failed. He used a freakin movie method of escape, you cant let that happen and play the victim by saying, 'oh well he was military trained'. He was but not past the point of keeping the sand out his pants.
hope he manages to get out of the country. he has been trained by the british army green beret to live off the land like rambo
And that's just before 9/11. Expect something people!
Hes going to be Count Dankula mad lads episode one day. 😂😂
the real downfall of britain is that we are in no major wars
Everyone who works at that prison in every position should be sacked and replaced
He will have a skin head and he will grow a beard and wear sunglasses hell be unrecognisable
Where are you getting 8 hours from 😂😂
The most camerad up country and no sightings lol
Our lot will probably spend millions of our money looking .
Hardly news then 🤔😂
Long gone now .
Bros the main character rn
To many prisoners because we've got half the world in them....
Considering he was working for Iran, good luck finding him. They are powerful so there will be no trace of him until he reaches Iran probably and releases a video explaining himself. He could also be in the Iranian embassy so he can't be arrested.
A trained soldier catch a grip
Obiviously an inside job, how did the guards know nothing about it for 8 hours ?, took them 8 hours to realise he was missing ?
What is that little melt going to do
All he has to do is go everywhere wearing a hijab and they'll  never find him.
He is probably going to be hiding somewhere that he won't be found as even he has to find places to sleep for the night and getting food + water is not going to be easy for him
He works for Iran he’s either left the country already or is in there embassy
He just got arrested in Downpatrick and they are acting like they don't know 😂🤦‍♂️
At this point just let him have it, guy’s skills are impressive😂
Did they follow the vans route 😂😂
Can’t wait to see the documentary for one of the best escapes from prison
they will get him soon, maybe 😮
disgusting and so simple
😂😂😂😂😂 don’t trust anything the MSM says lies lies lies .
He's a 21-year-old from the signals not a member of the SAS. He's just done basic training and was a computer jockey.
Check the Iranian Embassy or the dingy’s leaving the coast of Dover on route to Calais.  The CONservatives are not fit for purpose
The main job of prison staff, would be to not let prisoners escape? 👏
Pathetic government, this is a result of underfunding our prison system. Usually just 10 prison officers controlling 1500 prisoners at a time!
He's gone into hiding
Keep on Running = Spencer Davis Group
Lol
Smart lad or incompetent prison 😂
