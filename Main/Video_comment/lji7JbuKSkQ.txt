"You've won countless awards"
Bring 2026 world cup home kane please we've waited to long 😭😭😭
🐐
I'm using this interview as a listening test.
Obviously being inspired by the Tom Brady docu was utter BS to pander to an American audience. Bit cringey.
I really like the way British people pronounce 'water'."  😅
"you've won countless awards" LOL
tufffff no trophies innit
You are doing teasing and other stuff not good
I wonder if it was the money that inspired him 😂
0:26 not trophies 😂
Kane seemed to be chilled.
Countless awards? LOL Champ? of what? Seriously, great striker but the dude is cursed.
cool man
Kicking Rugby is pretty easy. Ain't it? It is. Most English football players have surely kicked a rugby as a child. That egg shaped thing. No big deal. Except in the US and A. They call it the "Football." Oh no.
He's our British rambo
This must of been thrilling for the Americans, the most boring personality from England. Also Harry's broken English must of been hard to understand
Harry Kane! He’s a good guy
I would have loved if Jimmy have said that he loves to win titles with him.
Didnt know Wyatt Russel was british
I swear I heard Jimmy said countless of awards ? Like what ? 😂
Hi Jimmy! I'm a content creator who broke 7 Guinness World Records in football (soccer). Would you ever consider having me as a special guest on your show?
Menudo paquete, los ingleses won las personas con menos talento para el deporte
Did Jimmy even understand a word Harry said?
"I always choose Kane" said no FIFA gamer ever.
Won what awards??
"You've won countless awards" is diabolical
One day in the future everyone will comeback to this comment after UCL winning by harry kane with Fc Bayern :)
More people knows Kane than the other guy they are talking about.
Jimmy just knew about FIFA game a day ago
0:25 Kane was silent asf 💀💀💀

Kane uses "kind of" many times to express his saying
0:24 Come on Jimmy !!
He never won a sin cup
Hrithik rohsan voice
Funny how Youtube enables subtitle for you by default, because Kane doesn't speak English.
Love includes marriage having good relationship
A childhood girlfriend of him sweet
Мне кажется у него хуй в горле застрял слушая как он говорит
I play foosball too
Kane is my favourite player from England
I stg I love Jimmy but he is a dork lol
So the kids when they grow up they can aspire to win zero titles XD
🐐 harry kane ❤
Harry is not a champ till now😂
"you won lots of awards"
Yeah obvisly.
Please somebody translate to English!
respect button for the subtitle & Jimmy to learn Spain language
Seeing harry Kane on an American show is so weird, lol
Harry Kane speak or not speak wht going on?😭
I don’t think he is speaking English, his pronunciation is like french word.
He's got his own theme: Rock You Like A HarryKane /watch?v=6yP1tcy9a10
Woah, one of the very few times he actually spoke English XD
Its not soccer 😭😭😭
He is the best
‘’You won countless of awards’’ Dawm jimmy watch football
Poor Kane. His FIFA character has won more trophies under Jimmy than irl.
I feel bad for him after we knew that they got knocked out Round of 16 in the 2022 World Cup.
Nice guy, but you can tell jimmy wished he was an ounce funnier
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
yeah well it's kinda went yeah.. i just kinda my friend is kinda great player he kinda played kinda well kinda uhh eh kinda yes i could play better kinda
In the end, Kane moved too, yeah, it's good to go to Bayern Munich, what else do you expect at Spurs if you have more than 200+ goals if you don't have a trophy? If you score a lot of goals without a trophy, it's not complete and it's useless too, an accomplished player is not just a goal, but a complete trophy if Kane wants to become the best player of all time for England.
Thank you YT for subtitles 😊❤
you've won a countless awards 😑😑 jimmy definitely doesn't know a thing about football!!!!!!
Me watching it in 2023 knowing he’s with us now😂
Welcome to Bayern Harry 🔴 ⚪️
Bro said no hard feelings then went on to have a tantrum😂😂😂😂
1# kane lover <3 he solos fr I love him
He doesn't sound like he looks
He said "kind of" more than 30 times
As a football player he’s just an amazing striker, but as a person he’s definitely a ten out of ten
Harry Kane the champ 😂 of Audi cup and thats it
Habadabilgaba
What a gentleman he is 😅
Bring harry kane to manutd
'you've won countless awards' 💀
harry "kind of" kane
I need subtitles to know what Kane said😂
"You won countless awards"  Yeeahh jimmy 😅
My Favorite player
What a torcher for Americans, having to pay to hear Harry Kane speak
Did they understand him?
kind of kind of kind of
Bro he called him a champ.. this is not nice
Come to madrid now harry
The..'You've won countless awards'..really hurt my ears. #AwardsAtTottenham
Mr Fallon, can you repeat the sentence, how many awards did he win you said? 😂
5:43 "Hopefully I can try and break that goal record whilst were [at the World Cup]", rather than "Hopefully we can win it"
He sounds so stupid
Never heard any one person say “kind of” more in an interview 🤣🤣🤣
Wtf is Harry Kane doing on American TV!!! Ffs that was the fakest "you are my FIFA player when I play video games" stutter stutter its my job to act like everyone in America knows this English football player 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
He's won "Countless Amount of Awards"??
Bro jimmy why u lying 😂
Won countless awards? U kidding me mate?
Boring boring intwrview. I mean this guy is talking like if he came into a new team and avertising himself seriesly. Nothing fumny realy
"You've won countless awards"
Harry kane when are you gonna win a trophy😂
Haha, socc*r what a funny word
Jimmy fallon: Your a good soccer player Harry kane: Im gonna kill you.
Dafuq with his accent??!?!?
Came to Barça❤💙
Tesco
"You won tons of awards" Never let Americans talk about football
Football players soccer for you guys 😂  is the best in world football is everything here in the uk
Average player.
Despite being a Liverpool fan and massively anti-Spurs,  I am getting tired of Kane trolls. He is a genuinely nice bloke, speaks well (yes, yes the accent), is down to earth, and let’s be honest, is an all time English  great. Excellent role model.  Enjoyed the interview.
I have 6 Kanes in fifa
such a polite man
Just came here to compare his voice with the one in the champions cartoons and now i get it 😂😂😂
Countless awards 😂😂 But no trophies
“you have won countless awards”
Won countless awards 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 , this shows that he clearly has 0 ball knowledge
someone understands the guy he is interviewing ?
Harry Kane is a HOMO!!!
we need subtitles  for real
You've won countless awards, jimmy doesn't know anything about tottenham
Kane is consumer of Cokane
Tomas Müller would be also a great gast  becouse he's so funny too❤🎉
Harry Kane Question to Jimmy should be "Did you win trophies"😂
Harry you need to leave  Tottenham or you will retire trophyless
Hk ist for Harry kane
Harry Kane is a great guy and England team captain..  But Jimmy doesn't have to tell him I play you.. LOL.
Hands up who knows Harry in the USA?
YOU WON MANY AWARDS!!!!😂
소중한 휴가때 토크쇼 나와서 너무 조앗었는데
Very intriguing interview.
I play Jimmy in FIFA...
Did Kane bring the Audi Cup trophy from 2012??
"You have won countless awards" should fallowed by "not your team"
overrated  player
He wins minifossball 😅😂I'm excited
He says kinda a lot . Sorry I couldn't not notice 🤣
Jimmy Fallon didn't do his homework.
he talks like chewing gum or something 😅
Invite neymar on the show
كانه مخزن قات وهو يتكلم
PLAYING KANE IN FIFA ???? HE HAS NO IDEA ABOUT THE GAME AT ALL
has won absolutely nothing in football and goes to Jimmy Fallon. That's the Kane i know!
He’s literally Alan walker but with less beard and stronger 😂
What did he say? Please add translation.
0:24 ok no hate but.. No
The best of England
great football player
Better English than Harry Kane
Unfortunate that he had dental surgery and a Late Night appearance the same day.
Soccer fans around the world: Did ronaldo,neymar,messi,mbappe, said no?
Either the wrong Kane was invited or another guest pulled out last minute and they spotted him walking down the road.
Is it English he's speaking?
The guy has never won anything!!!!!!! What museum he's innn?
HARRY KANE È BRAVO MA CERTE VOLTE LO VEDO ASSENTE DEVE ANDARE DI PIÙ SUL PALLONE
IL CALCIO BALILLA COMPRATO E TRUCCATO 😂😂😂😂
GLI MANCA QUALCOSA GLI MANCA LA MOTIVAZIONE
0:24 "You've won countless awards" 🤨🤨🤨
Top player without trophy meme material player
Kudos to the editing team to give captions on this video otherwise it was hard for a average person to comprehend harry's ancient language.
jimmy : No hard feelings. Almost cries at the end
SOCCER VS FOOTBALL
Tonight show But still no trophies
Fallon saying Hary Kane has won countless awards is just funny af. I know he has ươn a few individual awards but when Jimmy said that i automatically think of the Audi cup.
Esse jeito do Kane falar é difícil de entender.
Who would have thought Harry Kane will be in Jimmy Fallon show
you've won countless awards ????, Nice roast
Accent is outstanding. i sometimes don't understand
Harry Kane So lovely ❤️ You English proud to have this Man
I am such a big fan inplay as you in fifa 22 and here you are 😮😢🎉❤
"Youve won countless awards". He's not talking about tropheys i assume.
I think I need subtitles
Where is Harry Maguire interview him 😢
0:25 Thats a bit sarcastic but OK!
Kane and Jimmy. Can't wait to see Cristiano Ronaldo and Jimmy on Tonight show on day. It's going to be massive
Jimmy said "the sucker team?" 😅😂
It's so funny how Americans don't know anything about football and treat Kane like he's Messi or Ronaldo. He's a good striker but a superstar? Not sure. When his best position at the Ballon d'Or was 10th
'You've won countless awards."  Proof Jimmy knows nothing about Harry Kane
“you won countless of awards” jimmy trying not to mention the premier league
I like him his character is like for Michael Carrick, Darren frechar, James muriner, Paul Scholes
42,377
I wish there was subtitles for this one
jimmy stright up lying right away sayin he plays fifa
He won a foodball trophy???😂
for the first time jimmy put subtitles in the video i wonder why 😅
jimmy should have mentioned that Kane is the first top player to ever not win a trophy in his football career.
0 🏆
Adding subtitles on this is the most intelligent thing Jimmy Fallon has ever done
Harry “kind of” Kane
What if jimmy said soccer
Fallen: I play you in FIFA   Kane: Bro I am not Kane from WWE
Harry here's another criminal you can take the knee to and worship.....  https://youtu.be/sSpr1opPMk8
No sabia que jimmy fallon había invitado a semejante estrella del fútbol británico y juega en mi equipo favorito el tottenham
Didn’t knew jimmy understood German, that’s great.
worst interview ever for many reasons
I love Harry Kein My favourite futball
It's Football
I understood his English until 4:45
Interviews like this just reinforce how lucky we are to have Harry as our Captian! What a guy, a true inspiration
Kane is an amazing player irl but Fifa does him dirty because it's so insanely speed biased.
nice name
That speech impediment
U know Jimmy just lied about playing Fifa 💀💀
Harry kinda Kane
countless awards haha
Harry kNe and wining awards... Hahha he is everything but a champ... Tottenham wouldn't win a title bro 😂
I need Farley to interview him 😂
JIMMY is just funny come on😂😂😹
0:24 Did jimmy just said "You have won countless awards"😂
Fallon is a Terrible host and Kane is dull as fuck - what a combination 😂
First time seeing a soccer player being in Jimmy's show , all the others were singers , actors or famous people from America  but this one was unique
COYS!
watch this in 2x speed. i cant stop laughing 🤣🤣
"You won Countless awards"  Well I don't think so Jimmie
When they call it soccer 😢
I need subtitles.....
Cant hit target unchallenged when needed  folded,  we have better strikers but he suks gareth big toe
Man he must be the first one in England museum who won nothing
Jimmy prolly misses a shit ton of penalties then😂💔
Next time get a fucking interpreter or a guest who speaks English.
Definitely a London Tottenham North London Boy😂😂
Still he has won absolutely nothing 😆
It's really sad that even though having 330 or 335 goals, he wouldn't be considered a good player as he has no trophies to show for it
Mans kicked so many field goals he forgot he was taking a penalty
It's football & not soccer, Jimmy Falloff
This guy I swear to god 😂.  Kane is DEFINITELY NOT one of the best soccer players in the world lmmaooooo
Give this man some subtitles! 🤣
Harry Kane already planning his retirement I see.
“Countless awards” bahahaha. By the way, that translates as 0 trophies!! 🤣
I didn't know he actually spoke as a spaz I thought everyone was messing around he actually speaks like that 😂😂 definitely has autism 100%
Anyone else get mad at Derek Rae for cutting the other guy of when you score.
this is so random lmao
Still won nothing 😂 leave shite spurs an get something on your cv 😅
Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon? Eh?      He did OK.......football's still not coming home though :)
So random harry kane on this show fairplay😂👏🏽👏🏽
Needs to take that golf ball out his mouth
Wait where is his translator?
MORE SOCCER PLAYERS INTERVIEWS
WHEN CRISTIANO RONALDO??
Does Jimmy know Kane has never won a trophy?
Since when Jimmy Fallon understands Portuguese ??
This was weird af
Thanks for the subtitles
I'm surprised they picked him to be on, I get he's a star & capt, but most English people can't understand him,  let alone poor Americans, those soldiers must've just been sitting there nodding, smiling & waving! Idk why americans think a soccer player would do well at kicking goals in football,  you want a rugby kicker
sonny friend
Hey Jimmy, you never played FIFA and you proofed it.
Who would’ve known how good you can kick a ball over the bar.
Still won fuck all and never will!!
World class player with all the right attributes! Humility, honesty and determination.  What people forget ( CONVENIENTLY ) is that he won the Golden Boot at 2018 World Cup. The man is a Legend.   I salute you Harry Kane 👏👏👏
Give any pro football player of this level a month of practise and he’ll be the best kicker in the NFL.
what mother language does he speaks?
Harry kane is not a marketable player
It's football not soccer
i kind of liked this video.
Is he wearing eye liner, wtf 🤣🤣
It seems this is all he can do nowadays  Like Rooney it’s the old boys club keeping Kane in the undeserved spotlight  Why does someone be brave enough to tell it like it is He has lost a yard in pace - and trots around the pitch waiting for the next penalty  He has had his day and should be replaced with a proper striker full of energy and effort Take away the penalties from his total and judge him on goals from open play
Harry Kane the champ? He’s never won anything
i'm a non-native speaker, harry kane's accent is harder to understand than my enervated professor😅
"you won a lot of trophies..." I think you got the wrong guy Jimmy
i bet the audience has no idea what hes saying
Has 'kind of' replaced 'obviously' as his catchphrase.
Great of him to speak while having a mouthful of toffee.
настоящий британский акцент) звучит странно после изучение американского акцента))
Is this before or after the penalty
As a non-native english speaker, I'm proud of myself that I can understand what Harry said without subtitle on😭😅
Win countless award yet didn't win any EPL or UCL 😂
At 29, England's all-time Top scorer, Club's top Scorer, NLD top scorer, Club's most caped. 2 Epl golden boots, Wonderful person.. 0 trophies ............................. I feel bad for him really.
For the Americans who may not know who Kane is https://youtu.be/slWpmEo4Vz8
If I were Kane I had immediately leave the studio, when he said soccer. The name is football!!!
Would love to see if Jimmy invite Ronaldo or messi
Is that the way he normally talks? Like he just came from the dentist office.
Kane would be a great NFL kicker, he demonstrated that in the World Cup!!
Good player, but not one of the top ones. Messi, Ronaldo, Mbappé, Neymar, Modric, etc. Those are top players and they are on another level. Saying that Kane is on that level is kind of insulting for those who follow football.
Talks like he’s got something stuck in he’s nose
Harry Kane getting treated like he is goat in football so cringey
Still Trophyless.
Wats foosball?heard of fußball but foosballl🤔🤔
Should stick to foosball
A lot of " kind of's "
Jimmy has never played FIFA 😂
He's won nothing Jimmy
Messi number 1😂
Harry Kane should shift his occupation and become a news presenter on BBC
"U've won so many trophies" 😂
You won countless awards 😂 he plays for Tottenham ffs
England always have the best players but like to exit early saaaaaad - world cup 2022
He has ruined England chances in the last 2 world cups for being a greedy goal monger of a captain
Kane would be great at kicking field goals over the bar
Kane ❤❤❤❤
Jimmy is a bad liar 🤥😅😅
Haha in this show, harry kane speaking english well 🤣
Fuk that licking ass fake fuck host
Fun game Take a shot every time Kane says "kind of"
50 bucks says that Jimmy has never played fifa
Harry Kane- blah... blah..brr..brhh.. Bllh..bll...hhbbrr.....
why does Harry Kane sound like Khalli?
Countless awards did he just say that😂😂😂😂
He is overrated and never win anything
In the world cul kicked the penalty  like if kicking a field goal😒
Yeah, obviously...
He can certainly kick field goals....
You know American Talk shows lie a lot for audience purposes like telling Harry Kane a Spurs player , : "You've won so many awards " Hahaha Edit : So harry when you get on the show, Mention Tom Brady and American Football to make it sound like it's a famous sport that people around the world watch, okay ?  wink wink
This dude is the biggest clown who brought England down  Clown clown clown Harry clown
KIND OF
“You’ve won countless awards.”
hi
Is Jimmy fake
Harry Kane could make a great movie star ⭐
FAllon:...THE soccer team?! KANE : soo u choose death..
Erm what are the countless awards that he’s won?
0:27 "You've won countless awards" Kane: now hold on
Here after miss the penalty against France
Does Harry have bell palsy !?
The Guy who snobs M’Bappé 😏
I bet you no American in the crowd could understand what he was saying 💀😂
English is not my first language but I don’t know why I can understand Harry Kane much better than Jimmy
Most people in the audience probably don’t know who he is.
Feels a bit awkward watching this after his penalty vs France
😂😂😂😂🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳
Love Harry. He’s so humble and he played well at the World Cup. He just got unlucky 😢
I'm scottish but I really like Harry Kane 😊
That whole interview is literally cringe... nowhere from mature interviews we used to have. The conversation is so shallow and devoid of excitement. Plastic emotions, fake reactions, a false sense of appreciation from the host, wow, we want better...pffff
Kind of a superstar!
Wtf is kane in this😂 countless awards? Oh please tell me how many he’s got😅 and also Americans, he’s not one of the best in the world. He’s what we call in the Uk … overrated
One of my favourite Jimmy Fallon interviews! So natural just like a nice conversation! I think it’s on Harry’s part too he’s just such a chill guy
"You won countless awards" when una 😭😭😭
Wow kane is really speaking English 💀
Just found the ball in my backyard. I live canada , how do I give it back...
Now i know why he booted it over the bloody net, practicing for field goals 😂
hope there wont be one love here too
Just came across this video thanks YT algorithm 😑😑 Anyway, I have a lot of respect for Harry but have no clue as to why tf he's on this show. To me, it's so random!
The man that england hates right now xd
Yo are great striker respect from Egypt
He's one of our own He's one of our own HARRY KANE He's one of our own
The Huracane Kane 🔥🔥
If your not gonna wear a tie unbutton the top that’s just common sense, like that he looks like a stupid school boy
I hope the game wasn’t penalty kicks, because Kane would just miss everything
One of the Top "soccer" player in the world 😭😭😭
If it comes down to penalties. Bloody hell, I put my money on Jimmy
Now he is out, but he played a great World Cup and He seems really a good person!
and this 3:03 is why england lost.
Is kan native English speaker or use it 2th language
😂😂😭😭
"WON COUNTLESS AWARDS" 🤣🤣🤣 There are some things you just don't say to Tottenham players
I like Harry Kane, he seems humble.
Everyime anyone says soccer, I cringe hard
Great field goal for the penalty
Wow, never thought an english player football would be interviewed by Jimmy Fallon or landed interviewed to US
"You have won countless awards" ...he is playing for Tottenham🤣
"Could you kick fieldgoals?" Lol this doesn't age well 🤣
In 1977 Voyager I and II were launched containing 12-inch gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth to any alien civilization that may discover these artifacts in the distant future. In 2022 Harry Kane kicked an Adidas's Al Rihla World Cup ball at such a trajectory and speed that NASA have decided to discontinue any further monitoring of the Voyager probes as that ball has already left the solar system and is currently approaching the red supergiant star Betelgeuse where the impact is expected to cause it to go supernova destroying all terrestrial life as well as all extraterrestrial life within 1966 light years of Earth.
Harry Kane has won a lot of awards 😂
And that my Friend is Alan Walker 😮
still searching for that penalty ball
Did Harry Kane win a trophy for winning that Mini Football game? LOL
Love the Estuary English conjugations: always "we was" rather than "we were", and "he done" rather than "he did".
😂😂😂😂
average bexit geezer
“Won countless awards” bro jimmy you don’t need to dis Harry like that
lol this is so strange.
Rumours say Harry Kane's penalty shot landed all the way on the late late show
ironically england lost in the world cup because he shot it over the bar ;)
Kane has been kicking too much american football balls. His lousy penalty against France in Qatar is proof of it.
The biggest arse  in football, rude, xenophobic. That’s why he is in Fallon and not in fox sports . Americans have no idea about football.
Kane really showed the whole world what he is made off when England needed him the most.
now we know how Kane ruined his penalty kicks technique... thank you, Giants!
HARRY KANE WAS ON JIMMY FALLON!!?! That feels so random, but props! haha
It's coming HOME Baby...(The Ball is coming home)
What he chewing? Tell him to spit it out and talk.
Is it me or does he speak more clearly then he did when he was younger?
Everyone that knows Kane knows our boy toned down on the accent and that made Jimmy's job easy
It’s football 😂😂
I wanna see Messi here
I've never lost in foosball
Kane speaking English today
Overrated Player
Thanks for a French person. 🇫🇷
Nobody plays with Tottenham in fifa lol And Kane you blew it for England againts France.  Kicking it over the goal lol
It’s strange to hear a British football player say he got motivation from an American “football” player.
Bro he ain’t won any awards wit Spurs that’s bull Spurs got ntothimg
Should've practised his penalties.
Needed the subtitles for this one
“I play you”   Me too jimmy Me too
Still hasn’t won a single trophy he’s not the best player at all sn he sounds like he’s on crack all the time
Is it just me that finds it so random that Harry Kane is on here? It's great, but random af 😂😂😂
So is this all for money and marketing? Since EPL is now popular/trendy in US and being broadcasted? Plus the American owners? Tv rights? Otherwiser who would have cared? Lol
Countless awards🤔
We still lookin for the ball you kicked on penalty kick vs France Harry:)
Harry has a fantastic nose design!
Who's here after he missed the decisive penalty against France in FIFA 2022 ??
This popped up randomly on my recommendations after that penalty. Lol. Continuing the great English tradition of not making it past quarter finals ✨
Aah now we know where his penalty kick vs France came from Merica 🇺🇲
This appeared on my recommendation after France Beat England in the world cup
Foosball???
won countless awards? ehm... somebody should tell him
english are overrated at soccer, they always get beaten by argentina,france,spain and italy
I'm not a native English speaker (My native language is Spanish) and I can understand some stuff of what he says. Not everything, but some words and sentences.
Kicked his penalty the same way
"You won countless awards" Well, that just hurts, Jimmy!
Ayyy yooo guuuuys
Holy shit I've never heard him speak before. Did he suffer a severe mouth injury? Even Michael Caine doesn't talk like that.
what did he say
Jimmy is so fake here
I have never heard Harry Kane talk and I guessed in my head what he would sound like and I got it very right
England have no chance
If he support gay why he married
0:23 youve won countless awards... Kinda ackward question considering Kane has never won a major trophy LOL!!!
Buddy could kick a 100 yard field goal with that leg
Fallon is such a poser. He'll never be as great as Conan.
The guy can barely speak
hey Megan wazzup i cant stand Obama but Jamaicans are people n1 likes in England or France so please harry keep sterling in his slave ship like you always say he's from Ghana or Italy.
A trophyless career...what a tragedy. Nice one Tottnumb.
He plays foosball ? what type of sport is that? wtf?
Mah man said "soccer"... Yeahh Jimmy doesn't play FIFA
What the hell have talkshows become nowadays. Like what the was the point of having this conversation. You could tell both of them felt weird talking to each other.
Kane W⚓
Is it hard for non natives to understand him? Don't get the joke honestly
this is such a weird crossover
Harryyy i love youuuuuu
He can at least win a major trophy (even if its not internationally well recognised) in NFL than he can ever do with Spurs. A player like him deserves so much better and a club like Spurs is not gonna help him.
"noouuu i fink i fink"
Imagine trying to do an English accent but you're not allowed to move your tongue from the bottom of your mouth...that's Harry Kane.
Try moment he said “soccer” Kane went 😄😐
A real LAD
The only footballer who sounds exactly like his 442oons character 🤣🤣
That Brady Doc is legendary
That was kind of neat but also kind of long
Khinda, khid. Damn, this guy is probably an Arabic, Harry Khane.
Confusing how he says “foosball”
https://youtu.be/TVrfWElTJoU
Ouff he made efforts to articulate these words, these sentences, there on this interview I manage to understand it.
Jimmy trying to scrape up anything he can remember about football
He’s better than people think
Harry Kane your the best
The interview was kind of entertaining.
I never imagined Harry getting interviewed on a talk show, but well life is full of surprises. His entire family must be proud of him as much as his Tottenham's teammates of what he has achieved as a footballer although he was close to win a UCL.
Both guest and interviewer have Irish origin names. Just reads funny Kane on Fallon and not only that he is talking about Brady 😉
we have to win a trophy this season🏆 COYS⚽️
he’s our second highest goal scorer for a reason.  The reason being Rooney is better. Love you tho Kane❤️
The Fortnite Man.
Kaaaane!
JImmy Fallon: You've won countless awards Football fans: But no trophies. :D
Good interview tbf
Lmao Harry Kane wth is he doing here 😂
Overrated, overhyped, overpaid. Ohh and has won nothing
Jimmy : you've got many trophies   Spurs laughing in the corner
TBH Kane Is Not On My Footballers List That I Expecting Will Come To This Show.
"Harry Kane the champ everybody" - the irony😂
Fun fact Harry Kane has never played for a team that won a trophy
"You've won countless awards"  🤣
England - Hungary I 0- 4
What an effort to be understandable by Americans 😂
Click bait kmage reminds me of bruce dern
Jimmy so bad at FIFA he thinks Tottenham is a good team 🤣
Jimmy actually said that Kane won countless awards....
You won lots of trophy....guess he didn't know about Spurs
"You've won countless award" Yeah since you cannot use zero to count
Please give me Korean subtitles.
Please someone translate what Kane is saying
“You’ve won countless awards”
"You've won countless awards" team awards or individual awards?
He didn't mention which game Brady came to though...
4-0
Grande MiikelMsT
Harry Kane is a world class player.
who?
you won "countless awards"
oo
I had to put subtitles on I can't understand him.
This is so great! Can't wait for it to come out in English!
very useful subtitles here.
jimmy: "you've won countless awards" aint no way
son on the show when? 👀
Didn’t know he was playin foosball
One of the best striker in the world
"Harry Kane -the champ".....has never been a champ
This has to be the most random guest Jimmy has ever had. Most Americans probably have no clue who he is lol.
Most overrated player in Premier league history.   Bang in a hatrick against Panama missing against Croatia .   3 golden boots without even challenging for the premier league tell you all about  him
Kane is getting f uglier by the year but I guess playing for Tottenham would do that too you
나에겐 한글 자막이 필요해..
Sonny was probably amazing at the royal marine stuff seeing as he’s Korean and did military work
“Any goalths”
wait wat why is kane on this show???
Im kind of.. You know.. Kind of thinking, Harry should be named Kind of instead of Kane
Kinda
most random meet up ever lmao
It’s so stressful to listen to him 😩
The part that he said that kane won trophies ahahahahahaha
Kind of
Harry Kane seems like a great bloke off the pitch. too bad I hate him when he's on it LOL.
Says u won A lot of awards doesn't say trophies
Jimmy challenged Harry?
97% of american audience: who the fuck is that guy???
Rocky Balboa in real life
Champ? What's he a champ of?🤣 He plays for Spurs.
I dont know what people want his english is good yd
Kane can speak english? They dont understand him
The crossover that I didn’t see it coming😂
Soccer? Don't you mean Football? 😂
Everything was funny and good until the closing "Harry kane the champ" 💀
Won countless awards, jimmy u don't know shit about soccer this man got no trophies.
Countless trophies??🤣
'hello US of A!'...  Obviously a big fanny of Borat
England is in the same group as the US at the world cup 🤷
Hahaha
You have won counts of awards? No 😭
Man he looks like Dirk Nowitzki
The most random crossover ever.
He look alike Ryan reynolds 😅😅😅
he's English getting better
the accent hits hard
when he speaks we listen
voice of an angel
bro doing side quest
hahaha
🗿
Lol
Him and son are the two most dislikeable footballers in the world
The amount of makeup is just unhealthy, no wonder he plays for Tottenham Puffs
차려 입고 나오니 잘생겼네
Seeing this interview, Jimmy has no idea who Kane is or was before this.
Harryyy kane -antoine griezmann
This shows why kane is underrated. Literally half of audience there just confuse like who the hell is he.
Fallon acting FAKE AS USUAL. Makes me sick.
He needs to leave Spurs, so much talent being wasted. Love you Kane ❤️
Did FSG fly him out ? YNWA
i don't think it's just because he is an english, maybe malocclusion/underbite
Soccer isn’t a real sport unfortunately
Soccer? Its football played by feet.
okay wtf this actually feels so surreal to watch
foosball lol
00:40 it's like he's chewing tobacco.
he said KAAANEE 🤣
Love how little Jimmy knows about anything football lol did he call him the champ at the end there 🤣 the champ of what pmsl
Hes shit at football so he might as well do something shit Tottenham fans should embarrassed 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡
This is so confusing hahahaha
The champ of what I’m sorry?
Harry kane really wants to be American it's weird
The champ with exactly zero trophies😂 Still a world class player but the trophies stat is a bit sad.
Wtf Jimmy and Kane together?? There’s a glitch in the matrix forsure
No English subtitles for Harry!- what is the point of this interview?
so random. well bring  Ronaldo and Messi and Neymar too
a lot of „kind of”
Jimmy: You have won countless awards.  Kane: hello darkness my old friend
0:24 countless trophies, ah no
Lol this makes no sense
Watch his mouth ffs hary no trophies kan will give you covid
I think Benzema is the best overall striker in the world and Harry is a close second. And before people start crying about Lewandowski, I’m talking about their overall game, not just finishing and their goal-scoring record.
6:20 It only took 20 seconds for Jimmy to get Kaned
Awkward
Funny that he calls Kane ‘the champ’ at the end, even though he’s won nothing
0.26 i am dead 💀
"FOOTBALL NOT SOCCER"
English are not good in soccer, they never pass the round of 16 in world cup, so Harry isn’t a top player in the world, you have Messi, Ronaldo, Kross, Modric, Haalang, Lewandoski, etc.
"The Champ" 🤣
Top soccer players?? 😂😂
One of the random guests I’ve ever seen
Foosball  :)
This was bizarre.
That was such a grounded and pleasant conversation. No big antics or host showmanship. I liked the dynamic. Harry seems like a calm guy 👍🏻
kind of.
This was uncomfortable for everyone involved.
When Americans say ,,soccer'', Europeans can't understand why Americans aren't able to say ,,football''. :) This is neverending story.
First time ever I understand him 😅😂 When he’s interviewed in England it’s hard to get what he says.
what a juxtaposition interview.
0 trophies, ever. Yaya Sanogo is a more decorated footballer than Kane.
Brave of him to wear a black shirt, wouldn't hid much dribble
SCHOLES !!
I’m so sooo Glad Kane speed down his Accent! OM Godness I’m so happy I can understand clearly now! 😇😅
Ye obviously
Countless trophies …
Jimmy has no idea who he is
Hate when people make fun of his speech, he’s got lisp ffs, he was born with it smh. U know he’s a class player when the only thing people can put him down for is his speech impediment
Is it hard to say you been kicked by Croatia in semi final...or you dont remember who kick you out
Kane usually has a better haircut/style than this.
Harry is improving in English 👍🏻
Not even a single trophy and he said yes 😂
Peter Crouch interviews Camila Cabello. Kane with Jimmy. This is a weird crossover/multi-universe sh1t going on.
I thought Kane is the type never go to talk show Lmao this is so random
Fallon definitely doesn’t play FIFA.
When I listen Jimmy I feel yeah i understand English and my ears are good but the second i listen Harry I'm like wth
I like him he works very hard, head down and work mentality
What a great and entertaining guy, Harry Kane, I hope you have a great world cup in Qatar
“You’ve won countless awards” the mans never won a trophy though 💀
Who ever thought this would happen? This is just so weird but interesting lol
Invite Sonny on the show please!
I think they would need subtitles for this, in America
imagine baseball players training with the marines lol
Why “Foosball” ?
Jimmy had a very poor start because it’s clear he doesn’t play fifa or even play with Kane in his team 😂😂😂😂
Fallon demonstrating div 10 mentality by picking kane in fifa lmao
Cringe upon cringe upon cringe
Jimmy could not be any faker in saying he’s his “player” on FIFA 😂
He'll claim that as a trophy
There is NO WAY the audience didn't have someone holding up subtitles for them
I play you on fifa any fifa player knows that you can't only play 1 player and surely if you could you'd pick someone else, honestly Jimmy is so full of bs.
Errrrr errrrr errrr errrrr
Harry “kind of” Kane
never seen him wearing make up before
Im suprised Jimmy Fallon was able to understand Harry Kane despite Kane's poor English speaking abilites.
Great on Jimmy Fallon being able to communicate with Harry Kane despite the language barrier
Empty Cabinets
wow chatting about Kane's medal collection must have been amazing 😂
yo his english is getting better 😁😁
Now Harry can ad foosball champ to his empty trophy cabinet.
Amazing!
I can't believe Americans know this Kane now
Even as a Chelsea fan I must admit that this is brilliant content. ITS HARRRY KAAAANE
Jimmy should’ve put a trophy on the line if he wanted to win the game
Bring messi &  cr7 too
I've never heard Harry kane speak so clearly lol
O Souza Caverão Inglês
Come on harry....win something then move to the usa. .
Random asf but this is the content the world wants! Go on Harry ma boy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bring Messi and Ronaldo together... . . . . . (Okay, I'm just dreaming)
Who the fuck thought to put Harry Kane on the Tonight Show rofl
we need jack grealish on jimmy fallon
yehaaaaa finally someone amazing ı'm so happy to see soccer player in american show
Kind of
Wtf is he doing in America on tv
https://youtu.be/8cxjP3y9XXQ
Harry Kane is talented. I would love him to play for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership.
won countless awards??? lol
My eyes decieve me, mr lisp is famous.
Yeah obviously
I'd like to share with everyone you can be captain of winning nothing important
Sus
Jimmy chatting shit bout playing FIFA.  Also this is hilarious coz we all know Harry Kane can’t talk for shit 😂😂
More "kind of" than entertainment 😒
PlmahshshshjssnsuudysgshBzb team drive determination
Thank you for the caption
“You’ve won countless awards” has he??!??😂
Best player never to have won a trophy!
Hilarious that he's on these big American talk shows and has never won a trophy lmao
Why does nobody ever ask Harry to say Red Lorry Yellow Lorry ?
Truly multiverse of madness
dude Harry i am not disrespecting you..but remove whatever it is in your mouth and then speak
Also nice to see jimmy label him as one of the best players in the world because I think people forget he actually is
This just popped up in my recommendations, so random this link up
I need to turn on CC so I could understand what he's saying
Have I entered a different dimension….🤔
Clearly Jimmy doesn't play FIFA
Fucks sake the Americans already take this piss out of our accents. 😤😤😤 it’s only gonna get worse.
So fucking random... Bet he gonna leave this summer
0:27 he hasn’t won a major trophy
This interview was “kind of” funny
Won countless awards.......
I’m surprised the Americans could even understand him because even the English struggle
Audience in shambles
This is so random, like wouldn’t expect him to be on this show, but good on him
Jimmy Kimmel and other American talk show hosts should do more of this
Jimmy doesn’t play fifa
Americans… Prince Harry plays in the National Soccer team?! Fantastic!
Americans… Harry who? Where’s Meghan?
Harry Kane: Mumbles Jimmy: Hey Harry, I thought you guys spoke English in England?  Harry Kane: Yeah we do, what an Odd question? Jimmy: Alright Harry, all jokes aside I'm going to need you to start speaking English now for our viewers back at home.  Harry: What are you talking about Jimmy? I am Speaking English Jimmy: The producers told me you spoke English, I think there's been a mix up.  Can we get a translator in here please?
Anyone else put on CC cause Kane's speaking skills are.... well ..... bad ?
You won countless award’s hehe not with spurs
Fair play to Harry’s agent for getting him the gig and to try and make a career for him in America, but the guy has the personality of an open grave
I don’t get why Kane is on this? Is he plugging something?
0 trophies
Why does this feel like a different multiverse or something
Jimmy has never played fifa in his life.
Yeah American talk show hosts are cringe
Where the hell did this come from 😄
This is RANDOM!
Jimmy Fallon just said to Harry Kane: “ you won countless awards” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Probs best to advise kids to be engineers to be fair
“You won countless awards” 😂😂😭
Bro nobody plays Kane on FIFA. Even he knows Jimmy capping :(
Tom Brady came out of retirement after watching 37 year old Ronaldo destroy Harry Kane’s team
I like Harry. But you’ve won “countless awards”. Hmm.
hope he signs for Liverpool!
Thanks for the subtitle 👍🏼
I bet you half of the audience doesn’t know who’s Harry Kane 😁
💚
Spit that tobacco and speak
WTF
oh man, you should invite Sonny and Kane together, that'll be perffffect
Thanks for the subtitles coz I didn't understand any single word from Kane
Glad they didn't over plan the interview. Turned out very natural.
Harry is THE most British dude ever
Fallon is such a bad host lol I can't
Wait he can speak English😂😂😂😂😂
Someone get this millionaire a speech therapist.
Kinda this. Kinda that.
I didn’t understand him but it was entertaining
"You are my FIFA player, I play you"  Proof that Jimmy never played FIFA.
For Jimmy Fallon, this was actually a pretty good interview.
wtf is this combination?
"You've won countless awards"...ohh boy how do we tell him xD
Jimmy: 1-nothing Harry: 1-nil!
There's gotta be Son somewhere near.
You're my guy in fifa?....... Stop lying Jimmy🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
imagine seeing Harry Kane of jimmy fallon. this guy has got a very good right foot
Love hurrikane but "you've won countless awards."🤪
one thing i would never have thought, Harry Kane invited to an talkshow. 🤣🤣 but jokes aside, he is one of the best striker in the world today.
Sabe de Kane?!
Ah so this is why he was put forward for pfa player of the year award ahead of Son, the superior footballer. Kane is loved by British elitists that make fuck tons of money off his reputation as probably the biggest name for the national England squad and as a premier league "icon for the game". He makes the fat cats richer and so the British fat cats friends in America, the American fat cats want to do the British fat cats a favour and lick their arse by publicising Kane more in the American world. And here we are in the youtube comments with most people praising this "collaboration"... shows how well the fat cats have controlled your minds thus far, sheep.
This guy is a class act. He is so underrated
For all those who don’t know - this guy is a lethal goal scorer who has never won a piece of silverware because he plays for Tottenham 🤣🤣
Why is Harry Kane doing the tonight show?
Jimmy Calling Kane "The Champ" , just shows he knows nothing about football or maybe he is just a Legendary troll, LMAO
Anyone has link for english version?
You are my fifa uhh player. TF
why is 0 trophies kane on jimmy fallon and not a more relevant player? even Son would make more sense lul
I'm Welsh and even I was like fair play
Stopped watching when he pronounced soccer
Litterly I was doing a totenham rebuild and I saw this
kind of
'What do you read.'.... 'URRRR'. Clearly Jimmy doesn't know English football that well ha
I wonder if Jimmy was thinking about Harry's accent🤔🤔🤔
WTF am I watching?
Overated guy
Oh yeah just remembered after his football career he want’s to be a kicker in the NFL
I’m English (& I also lived in America) I struggle to understand what Harry’s talking about lol.
Kind of
I think Kane is actually in love with tom Brady
Say kinda oooone more time 🤯
Why is this happening? lol
Why have him on show without any research
Reminds of Rio, the way he talks.
When are they gonna when are they gonna  have Messi in here that would be fun to watch!
COYS
Oprah & Ellen next for HK🤣
“Won so many awards” 😂😂
Jimmy said, his won multiple awards,🤣🤣
the champ?
Damn harry kane speaks really good spanish . Never knew hes such a fluent speaker , despite never playing in spain .
He talks like he just came from the dentist. Good guy though:)
Harry Kane doing celeb shit is just LOL.
"You won countless awards" 😭
Coys
0:25 Such as the audi cup
Kane tf ? 😂
Harry Kane ......is on an American talk show. What the hell is going on?
HAHAHAHA jimmy has never played FIFA and it shows
The fact that you call him a soccer player and not a footballer
Kane:uhhhh
great player proud to have at my club tottenham hotspur
"countless awards" yes an audi cup and golden boots LMAOOO
This is a very unexpected crossover, but it was honestly an entertaining and interesting interview
Kane is so elegant!
"won countless awards"
Well, I wasn't expecting this.
WTF IS HARRY KANE DOING ON JIMMY FALLON?😂😂😂😂
Who is guy?       :Fat American
Spurs are still shit.
Harry may have 99 awards but trophies not one of them😎
Go to bayern munich Harry and take son with you
Same amount of trophies.
Jimmy : I play you! Harry : Are you playing me now? coz most Americans play Messi and Ronaldo... 😂😂😂😂😂
Kane's english is getting better
Kane is just normal humble guy who is true leader and celebrity ,he doesn't need stupid thing in his life and showing off every day on social media to put some "light" on his name .This is how should real athlethe look like !
Unexplained interview lol
GIVE THAT MAN A FALLON D'OR
I forgot he sounds like he’s underwater when he’s talking 😂
0:25 Jimmy you did not have to do him like that. Won countless awards yeah
Never won a trophy
"You've won countless awards" hahaahahahah he's literally won fuck all
dull as dish water
Why the fuck is Harry in America
“You booted it oh my god” Americans are so tapped
a prem player on jimmy fallon show,stinks of desperation from all involved.
Harry tries really hard to speak English that the normal audience can understand lol
Fallon trying to come up with something at the start is quite something.
Huhhh?? Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon... This is very random...??
Kane, Yes. Fallon, nope.
Harry Kaneeeee
Of all football player,a tottenham player….a club that has never won any trophies…………….
Expecting Sonny🤞🏻
Tom Brady was there the day the goat scored a hat trick in London and we’re not talking about Harry Kane 😉
Hello, i'm mr frog, this is my show, i eat the bug!
best soccer player? soccer? are you kidding me? it was never be soccer , always football
Handsome Kane : )
the irony of interviewing someone who has ZERO trophy hahaha
Did my captions turn on by itself or is this default when Harry Kane speaks?
Kind of …
How boring
Coys
THE HURRICANE
Harry Kane’s English is not that bad actually like people say! You just need to read the subtitles and you’ll understand what he is saying! 😂
3:38 - "You BOOTED IT, Oh my GAAAD" 😂😂        Gotta love Jimmy Fallon.   Jim, Harry Kane knows the assignment. He see's a ball... he kicks it.
I'm a West Ham fan (rivals of Harry Kane's team) but he's a class act and I love rooting for him when he's playing for England.
jimmy actually said "you've won countless awards" lol
Looool what's he doing on there
won many awards 🤣🤣😂😂- nice joke Jimmy
I was kinda hoping they would have put subtitles when Harrry spoke.
Countless awards 🤨
Harry Kane, I wish you all the best in Qatar!
The crossover u didn't even know it will be happening 🤣🤣🤣🤣 dude even says soccer
champions league next year 🔥🔥⚽️
Fair play Harry Kane you donny!
Errrrrr..... kinda ........errrrrrr
The champ? Hahahahha
You are my fifa player💀
He's never won a trophy. Nothing, zilch, zero, sweet Fcuk all
The most Brits the comments section has ever had
He’s my favorite player after Messi. So great Captin personality and great player.
ya what Americans know anything about Football, they have a totally diffrent game named Football which only get kicked by the foot once.
What is he saying?
Take a shot everytime he said the word ‘kinda’
Did you know that a Spurs supporter actually invented the table football game ?
The unexpected guest. More football stars, please
Need to see Jack Grealish or Erling halaand in these interviews
Does he have something in his mouth? He looks and sounds like it
Being disabled and getting this far is brilliant! It’s hard enough being disabled but being in the public and playing so great is amazing. Inspirational for all disabled people
first camila cabello and crouchy now harry kane and jimmy kimmel 😭😭😂
I love footy but listening to this person speak  hurts my idea of evolution
ماعنده بطولة😀😀😀😄😄
Punch him for calling it soccer
“So many awards”  That’s a bit of a stretch , don’t you think so. 🤓😭
What language is he speaking?
jimmy called kane the champ...but dont u have to win to be a champ?
“Countless Awards” 😂 Jimmy clearly doesn’t who he is
케인 슈퍼스타네?ㅎㅎㅎ
Porco Kane
Why was kane on jimmy fallon im baffled
i cant believe that harry edward kane is on jimmy fallon
This is the most random thing I’ve ever seen
Speaks better English than Harry Kane
gimme a bo'oh wa'ar
My boy Kane💙
As an Arsenal fan this is the collab I never knew I needed
What a fuckin player!!!!!!!
This is weird 🤣
Football is really starting to grow in the US
"Harry Kane, the champ" lmao... Do some research Tonight Show.
This is random af lol why would his manager not choose Cordens show bc then he wouldn't have to hear the dreaded S word come out anyone's mouth instead of the correct one, Football.
Both Kane and Brady are also excellent golfers. Another reason they bonded no doubt.
Wtf is this? jajaja
What is schols doing here? 😂
This may sound strange... But that was actually a very nice conversation 😂 no forced celebrity gossip, or jokes. No fake laughing, and acting like pals. Just a very interesting and professional conversation, and Its a big improvement on the norm.
This is weird. USA is one of the only countries in the world where football isn’t one of the most popular sports so seeing Harry on here I doubt most Americans know who he is
The Irony of calling him "the champ"
I’m British and need subtitles
Y everybody feels weird watching this is America getting into  UK style soccer?
좋은 사람! 멋있는 선수!
I bet jimmy never played FIFA in his life 😂
Like Kane is like the worst player in FIFA 😅 he has never played
It's called football, what you call football is rugby with ridiculous pads and helmets.
Lol harry kame was gonna shake his hand
Harry confusing the hell out of the yanks with his mad lisp.   Joking. Love Harry. From an Arsenal fan.
Why is Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon? I'm so confused.
American twang Harry uuuuuh is uuuuuuhh myaaaaaah favourite uhhhhh type of Harry. Kind of uuuuuh, soundsuhhlikeeeerrr that guy from cheers
Pure professional
Yes Harry Kane definitely has won countless of teams especially with the greatest Soccer squad Spurs
I’ve always said it, now I’m pleased to hear it… his time at Norwich made him the player he is today. 🔰
More personality in the fuseball players than Kane
Kane is such an amazing guy 🤍 #COYS
Lol he said the ‘champ.’ Has he won any single championship?
This is the most unexpected guest on Jimmy's show lol
“Won countless awards”. Just thought for a second he was gonna say trophies
never won a trophy lol.
He never win a cup 😂😂😂😂 becouse he played the smal team vallen Tottenham 😂😂😂
Jimmy, as good as Harry is/was, he plays for Tottenham. That’s how we know you don’t play as him on FIFA. Nice try.
Jimmy Fallon plays FIFA? Come on, he doesn't even know what soccer is.
His accent actually improved
Harry 'obviously' Kane
Weird crossover
WTF 90 % Americans don't know his skills to be honest....
Kane had to deal with him saying soccer lol
The first 30 seconds of the video shows you how much fallon actually lies lmao. No one who has ever played fifa has said the words "kane is my guy in fifa." Hes a brilliant player in real life, but in fifa he runs slower than my nan.
“Harry Kane the champ”
when fallon introduced him by saying "you've won countless awards"  T_T
So he's never fully committed to or done any of the things he talks about, just 'kind of' does things😂
Ahh. Americans. Know nothing other than the square inch the live on. The rest of the world is a blur. Thus being one of the most stupid nationals in the world.
The duo we never knew we needed
JIMMY HAS NO FOOTBALL KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN TELL🤣🤣🤣
Countless awards? Maybe individual ones certainly none with Tottenham 😂
This is so random, out of all top Footballers in the world they invited Harry Kane 💀
For the record Americans, even to us he sound like the British version of Lenny from of mice and men 😂👍
You don't pick just a player when you play FIFA, you pick a team...
Wow, I'm impressed that Harry actually learnt how to speak English before the show
kane on jimmy fallon ? weird
For someone that is not speaking in his native language, harry Kane really speaks Spanish so fluently.
COYS
'On the video game I play as you' 😒 He's not a fucking character in an RPG game. Clearly don't know FIFA at all 🤣
no one in England thinks he is a superstar
This guy needs a spit guard when he speaks ffs lmfao 😂
Stick to proper football Harry. Your not that good at that. Ignore everything elset
Is he going to play for la Galaxy?
How did Harry Kane end up here? 😆😆
"When I play fifa I play you" right.. okay
kindaaaaaa , kind offfffff
in the u Qhay
Harry Kane has won countless awards? Really???
The start is so awkward :D
He is very humble and kind player. Congratulation
Why is Harry Kane here 😂😂😂
He's won so many awards? Good choice of words by Jimmy Fallon. That could have got awkward
Kane is freaking awesome! A Barca fan
Derek Rea:It's Harry kane
What’s he selling?
Yawn
we needed english subtitles when the Englishman was speaking.. anyway fine🤣🤣
Man said kind of 71521 times in one interview
POV: You’re shocked to see Kane on an American talk show.
He might just be one of the most boring footballers about so how has he ended up on a talk show 🤣
Wait what awards lmfao 🤣 😂 💀
countless awards lmao none with tottenham
What? When did he—
When I saw the title at first I thought they were making fun of the way Harry Kane speaks. (With the word foosball)
No trophies 💀💀
Is this the correct timeline?
Us Brit hardly understand what’s he’s saying can’t imagine how Americans can understand a single word
Not complaining but rondom AF😂
Kane should have this captaincy revoked for not correcting Jimmy, it's FOOTBALL not SOCCER.
this combo is weird but nice haha
So why is Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon.  Was he visiting the 🇺🇸 or promoting something?
Accidentally stumbled upon Fallon after years and it’s nice to see he is still making his shows for 12 year olds.
No.  The other way around. Tell it like it is, pls
POV: you liked this comment because its football not soccer
the champ who never won a trophy?
harry kane, the champ? wow
I can already tell that Jimmy Fallon has never played fifa.
I play you in fifa - nothing says more that you dont play fifa when you say you play a specific player, much less Harry Kane that plays for Spurs (a good but not top team)
He doesn’t get the respect he deserves.
Step 1: Turn on CC Step 2: Enjoy the video
Used Harry Kane as his striker on FIFA? Stop the cap!
The world: he's one the best striker America: who's this guy
Why bring someone who can't talk to a talk show?
Harry Kane the champ.... lol not quite
After watching McGinn's interview and then stumbling upon this clip, I realized that Kane's English, though some rewind necessary, is at least comprehensible.
It’s the guy from Fortnite!
Why all comments are weird🤔
Lmao.. brother has no idea what fifa is..
You’ve won countless troph… awards
Harry is talking about the game of Tottenham Vs Man Utd. Tom Brady was mesmerized by seeing the GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo, and then after the game, CR7 said to Tom - "You finished, right?" that's what triggered the return of Brady at some level. #CR7 #GOAT #ManUtd
That’s the game I was at and the game spurs lost  United won and Ronaldo scored hat trick
I bet most Americans don't even know what Premier League and FIFA are..? Because to them, hand-egg is football. they call real Football, soccer. Which is very weird and funny.
I just came here to hear his english
after 20 seconds you can see that Jimmy has no idea who this guy is.
You’ve just got kaned
what is going on here?
Most random guest ever hahaha
000.0⚽️🏆🤣
Jimmy have absolutely no idea who he is!! No one plays with Kane on Fifa!!
Imagine he retires with no trophies
“You’ve won countless awards” At Tottenham…😂
Jimmy: "so, harry- " Kane: "yebramaahshiy..." Jimmy: absolutely fantastic
You've won countless trophies, shut the fuck up mate it's tottenham not arsenal, City, Liverpool, manu or Chelsea
He is good lad , but he plays for Spuds.
Best false 9 in the prem next to Firmino for me
Harry praised lgbt people enough times to be on in the show
FOOTBALL NOT SOCCER MATE
The fifa thing is the biggest lie ever. How do you say that you pick “kane” like what? That makes no sense, you pick a team not a single player.
still no trophies
Bro still speaking rubbish
Why the absolute fuck is he on the Tonight Show????
Is it me or does Harry always sound like he has something in his mouth whilst talking?
Jimmy deffo doesn’t play fifa
Kind of...
Wtf happened
He is here only because he is English. Of course modric wouldn't make it.
Not even Kane believes that Jimmy plays FIFA n he uses Kane as his player. 😂
‘So many awards’😂😂😂
Bring Mo salah better than this
He is so boring. Miles off it
wired voice
Why?
yet he's won nothing in his career lol
''One of the top players'' yeah mate you should check his trophy cabinet
The USMNT will be playing England at the World Cup and Jimmy didn't even ask about it...
This is definitely not harry kane. I think its a clone. This is definitely not harry kane
Not soccer shit
“Won many awards” jimmy doesn’t know just how successful spurs are🥴
so random.
What language is harry speaking??
Wow I actually understood what Kane was saying...well kinda
I wouldn't even rank Harry kane top 20 best players in the world
You are my fifa player when i play videogames 😂😂😂
What if Harry went to Barca ?
I’m so happy this video has subtitles
He talks like he's got two tongues in his mouth
1) Did Jimmy really call Harry the "champ"? He knows what Tottenham Hotspur is, right? 2) Surprising Harry didn't mention that he met Beckham when he was younger and that he met his wife when he was 9 years old. 😂
Harry Kane! you're amazing !
What a voice
Football
Must have his 96 card on FUT 😂
Him and Neville from Harry Potter look the exact same.
As an Arsenal Fan what the hell is going on??
Ted Lasso like this
He says kind of a lot if u notice it
He was so confused but it was funny
Would much rather see a drunk grealish on this show
Do Sonny next Jimmy
The Champ? Champ of what? The Audi Cup? 😂
Well done Harry Kane you should have bought Paul Tierney and Graham Scott and a few EPL referees with you.
It is so fucking weird to see kane on fallon 😂😂😂😂
Jesus... they must be struggling for guests 😃
Harry Kane must be the dullest person ever
It's crazy that a footballer as good as Harry hasn't won a single competitive trophy in his entire career. For all his incredible goals, he still has no silverware to show for it.
I thought at least somebody would make a joke about fallon calling harry kane a champ
kind of kind of kind of kind of 🤦🏻
last year i really want him at city😭
"You are one of the top soccer players in the world "  Ok time to leave!!
Won countless awards cuz Tottenham literally didn’t win any
Harry didn’t challenge Jimmy. Jimmy challenged Harry
Wrong guests, I guess. It's should've been Son Heung-Min with Tom Holland or BTS. I mean, he is the very first Asian who got the golden boot (top scorer surpassing Kane) in the Premier League. Come on?
Harry Class A well said
The collab we didnt know we needed
Great foosball challenge
Won countless awards no trophies though 🤣🤣🤣
How nervous is he …but he is a cool guy though. Keeps himself to himself and works hard
How's your trophies Harry?
Why ??????
win countless trophies?? 🤣🤥
Will virat kohli come on this show?
No way that was the first thing he said 😂
Talk show and Harry Kane. Who thought this was a good idea?? Jesus.
I Thought it was clickbait 😅
Well I did not think I’d see Harry Kane on the Jimmy Fallon show
Imagine jack grealish training with the marines 😭😭
Harry kane the “champ” jajaajajajaj
Harry went to shake his hand right at the beginning 😂
KIND OF KIND OF KIND OF
Hey Harry how many trophies have you won at Spurs..
talk talk talk 'ERRRRR' talk talk talk 'ERRRRRR' talk talk talk 'ERRRRR' talk talk talk 'EERRRRRR'
Won many awards ....    No trophies though
I have never been so confused before in my life
Harry Kane on the Jimmy Fallon show now I’ve seen it all.
If your favorite player in FIFA is harry kane, your not playing FIFA🤣😭
this was dreadful
Hello
He says kinda in every single sentence
Kane is fluent in German in this one wow impressive!
"You've won countless awards". He's won nothing!
0:20 almost said trophies. 😂
Jimmy: “You’re the captain of the English national team, you’ve received countless awards, you’ve won…. **checks notes**…. hey, there’s an exhibit about you at the museum of London!” 😂
What is this guy talking about.
Harry “kind of” Kane lol. On some real shit tho, he’s actually really humble and inspirational
Kane looks like a brother of Henry Gallagher
what's wrong with his accent????
Painful to listen to this man
This is so random 😂
Who else had subtitles on?
Kane is world class. Top 3 9s today easily
Harry Kane is painful to listen to
Havent watched anything yet but i already know the cringe will come like an 18 wheeler to the face.
0:25 "Countless awards"
Now all of America will take the piss out of his frankenstein accent 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you have a long layover flight,  and you decide to stop by a late night show.
"Odd. Most Odd" -a wise cartoon character
6:48 "harry kane everybody the champ " AHAHA champ of what? XD
Harry Kane 'The Champ' what has he won?????
Legend ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hands down, Kane's English massively improved since Spurs signed English teacher last transfer window.
Wait what? Kane on Fallon?
Jimmy has never watched football or played fifa 😂😂
0:24 that's a Cap
I died of laughter when he said the CHAMP 🤣🤣🤣
I thought he'd feel more at home at Jonathan woss
Only if they asked about TROPHIES
Fallon never played FIFA lol. ,” I play you” yes you played him by saying that lol
Yeah obviously
Wtf lol
show him Tottenham trophy cabinet 😅😂
The crowd must be thinking did I miss the audience raffle ...
It's not soccer it's FOOTBALL
Pained me for jimmy to say 'youve won countless awards' . notice how he didnt say trophies haha dam jimmy das cold man
Yet not won a trophy
Bar the TOTS card no other Harry Kane card is usable. And pretty sure Fallon is not playing FUT out there.
"you've won countless awards." me: are u sure about that?
the fact that he’s spoken clear enough for this talk show is the most surprising! lmao
I did not use to like Kane because I usually like strikers that are fast, and nimble with great dribbling, but this guy's combination with Son in Spurs is awesome. Also he has one of the best passings I have seen on a striker, beside his great finishing ability. They are one of the favorites in the WC this year.
great player who has won pretty much nothing in his career
Harry is one of my favorite players. He is right and nice person and always set an example something.
The champ? LMAOOOOOOO
His 96 card in fifa 22 is insane. He got me in div 1
First time I've seen Jimmy actually let his guest speak. He probably couldn't interrupt him as he likely had no fkn clue what Kane was saying 😆
Dude is a mumbler
Talks like he just got his wisdom teeth removed.
I've checked guys he doesn't say ye obviously at all. He's replaced it with " I mean"
Listening to Kane, think I can guess where Sonny's bad English might be coming from.
Jimmy wanted to say "this stupid game"  at 6:45 lol
Why am I just seeing this now Wtf 🤣🤣🤣Harry no way !🤣🤣
still gas zero career trophies
Unbelievable!! It's Harry Kane!!! Next Sonny please 😂 #COYS
Soccer.. 🤔🤔
the game with jimmy was kanes first trophy
When Brit meets American - Based on true story 😁
Seems like a great guy and like Jimmy said, one of the best strikers in the world
Why is he even invited? 🤣
WHAT IS THIS ENGLISH PROPAGANDA BEING SPREAD ON AMERICAN TELEVISION!?!?!??!  JIMMY, WHY CANT YOU GET CHRISTIAN PULISIC- THE LEBRON JAMES OF SOCCER- ON YOUR SHOW!?!?  COME ON FALLON!
He seems like a nice guy
Didn't expect this. Wow! 😀
Kane won a trophy finally 🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy why do you have to lie and bullshit to start off a conversation you definitely know nothing about FIFA or Harry Kane so don’t act like you do
Mr. Harry Kane killer from 5 yards out
We need more players on the show
Why do all these athletes talk about Brady being one of the “greatest athletes in history”. He cheated. Multiple times. To win multiple rings. How does anyone honestly respect that guy. He’s a cheater.
Wait... what?..
It's fake guys, Harry is not there My source is just can't believe it
What he chewing
Did Jimmy just say to kane you are one of the top soccer players in the world? Lol you can tell Jimmy never watched soccer.
Jimmy's in div 10
I kind of thought that was kind of cool 😎
Who is this trophyless man??
What’s Kane doing here? So weird lol
James corden would be a perfect fit with kane tbh
i cant belive this🤣
Harry Kane On Jimmy Kimmel. This is weird and soooo great. He was amazing  during the European Cup last year. He captained our country to the semi final and stood for social justice and equality when some people let our team down by posting horrid, terrible racist tweets against our Black players. Love him🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Steph Curry on Graham Norton next ...Graham saying "you're my player on 2k"
‘You’ve won countless awards’ Lol aside from a golden boot, he ain’t won shit buddy
He is not as good as in Fifa. He is in this interview because he is British. Players like Ronaldo, Rooney, Torres were much better.
Harry kane making a move to MSL soon!!
I thought I am the only one feel kind of weird here,seeing Harry in US tv show...
It's football when talking to him, don't fucking say soccer
Jimmy Fallon is so fake and annoying for no reason. Like just be yourself man
Why Hes won nothing??
@BleacherReport please add this to “the champions”
very nice person
Jimmy's interactions get more plastic  with each interview
Don't lie jimmy, you have never played FIFA, and ffs why would you use Kane? Man moves like a truck
I’m not a Spurs fan, but I honestly love Harry Kane 💯
What a boring sod
Mans a Englishmen y’all like he just learning the language
I got into football because of kane and then loved it even more because of Son!
The most random shit I could ever have imagined.
American shows and celebrities need to get that football is played in Europe too. Always defaulting back to English league is boring.  How random to have Kane and not Karim Benzema, Lewa, Chielini, etc.
Let's have HARRY KANE on the show but talk about Tom Brady. Jesus writers...
“Countless awards”- jimmy doesn’t have to run it in
This is just so random it’s confusing yet entertaining
This felt so surreal seeing Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon. I see Harry Kane almost weekly here in the UK and watched a lot of Jimmy Fallon over the years but seeing the two together felt very strange indeed.
jimmy is so awkward says he plays fifa
Can they understand Kane speech?
Tf is Kane doing out there lol
What is foostball
'Harry Kane, the champ!' now there's something you don't hear everyday....
Like watching paint dry! 🤦‍♀️
He didn’t say “well obviously” a single time!
Love this guy❤️
Tottenham are a Banter Club.
Sorry didn't catch any of that Harry
You’ve won counteless…um .. awards … that was the best bit
kane needs to chiill out and stop being nervous
Oh wow this is confusing
Harry Kane is the Legend 😀💪⚽🔥
Simple and to the point. You can't hate him
“KAAAAANE” what a freaking liar,  he has never played fifa before😂😂😂😂😂
This gotta be something to do with the multiverse😂😂😂
‘ You’ve one countless awards ‘  He hasn’t
I can’t believe He speaks good English. He hardly speaks over here
Only thing he will win
The Man has power in his legs, hate that he plays for Sp*rs, but love him when he's in an England Shirt. He's a Gunner at heart.
Anybody know what language Harry Kane is speaking?? 😕
Good to see Harry our captain be a good world cup
COYS!!!
Like an Athletico Mince sketch
was harry kane the only known footballer player with time off? because this is random as fk 😂
He is such a genuinely nice and talented bloke.
Jimmy calling Harry a champ was hilarious.
Harry Kane - not even one title😂
This was different 👍
Countless awards? He plays for spurs
This is so random 🤣
Before I clicked I was like "wtf is Harry Kane doing there? Did he sign to a MLS club!?"
This feels weird.
This mans a player! Spurs lucky to have him
Surprised that there were no subtitles
Footballs coming home in 2022
Why is everyone shocked ??lmao didn’t you hear they are doing preseason training in New York…he took time to do an interview with Jimmy.
Harry Butt-head
I wonder if Jimmy was pre warned about the saliva that Kane fires from his mouth everytime he tries to speak.
Seems like a great guy, too bad he isn’t winning anything with Tottenham, he should go to Man City or Liverpool and win some trophies, he really deserves it
Subtitles needed
Harry 'kind of' Kane
THE CHAMP?! the hell did he win?
He’s won numerous awards… but no trophy’s lol get out of spurs harry…
That lisp really doesnt help the English stereotype that Americans have of us haha
How many times does Harry say kind of? 😂
Harry kane on the jimmy falon show LMAOOOOOO
Kind of
“I mean”
countless awards? His team haven't got a trophy in a decade hahaha
Ahh yes ur my fifa player wen I play fifa
Spurs are sh#t
What’s a Tottenham?
Reports say Fallon still haven’t shaken hands with Harry….
"You have won countless awards", well you gotta compensate for the lack of trophies hahaha. I like the guy though, great sportsman, just bad teammates, in both Tottenham and the English national team
Wow if he is a top player, this guy must’ve got so many trophies 😳
My guy said he won countless awards😂😂😂
Yo Jimmy don't overrate kane cause he ain't no big soccer players  But he is a regular soccer player  Faxz%
The most boring person to listen to. Zero charm or charisma.
Jimmy seems a little to fake/awkward in this
Why people say they can't understand Kane when he's speaking, I understand everything
Dang seeing how much work Harry Kane puts in and despite that, the likes of Ronaldo and Messi being above him. Those guys must work like absolute dogs at all times. Amazing!
Lots of awards 🤣 zero trophies 🤣
"you've won countless awards"
🛎end. Bang average baller. Should have asked to see his trophies Jimmy mate. He has the exact same amount as me👍
HAAAARY KAAAANE IS ON OF OUR OWN !!!!
What a random guest to have on Fallon, Harry Kane not sure most of the audience would know who he was.
didn’t get a word of any of that Kane
Why the fuck is Harry Kane here? 😂
Jimmy please tell me what awards he’s won
an American, who usually call football soccer, doing a football interview with one of the best players of the PL  oh this is going to be fun XD edit 1 :oh god jimmy calls it soccer too
Even more reason to hate Tom Brady.
Mouth breather.
You can tell he doesn’t play fifa😂
Jimmy called him the champ yet he hasnt won a single title in his career
Strange  hes on here noone dosent even know who he is in the usa.
Kmmm Mmm Km M K Mmmm Km Mmmmmmm Mm9k Mm M Km K M Km k m K Mmmmmmm Km  Km  Km M K Km M Hi H H , Hi Mm Hm Hi M Hi H H H H h H Mm Hm H.
"You've won countless awards" gotta hurt
First 10 seconds couldn’t be more awkward 😂 we all know he doesn’t play fifa
Man said countless amount of awards 🤣 😂 💀
what kinda language is he speaking?
A legend with 0 trophies 😂
American lies to British man
Tottenham legend love him
Did he just call Harry Kane the champ? 😂
Whoever his speech coach is needs a pay riithse
Harry’s journey of making it , yet never making it as he has never won anything 😂.
He’s won countless awards 🤣. I’ll put this is American for you fallon , he’s never won a championship or a throphy dude . Fake laugh at that you loser
Drinking game alert!  Take a shot any time Harry says "kind of"...
Countless awards¿?
harry kane longbottom
whys he lying😭😭kanes card is asss
Have i been spiked? Wtf is going on
Random. But not as random as when a peak 50 cent turned up on the Turkish version of ‘deal or no deal’. I have yet to see a bigger example of randomness.
Mad how this man still has never won a medal
Gratz Kane. Good luck reaching the best scorer for England Nation. Seems a very nice guy
Tom Holland totally gonna love watching this lol ❤️
Why?
Whats he doing there??
Booooring yet surprising
Yeeeaaaahh obviously Kane is on Jimmy Fallon show 🤷🏻‍♂️. Love this! Fair play
If kane was a good player he would've left once he heard "soccer"
Harry Kane to win the Fallon D'Or
Crazy he's never won a trophy.
Harry Kane, simply put, is awesome. #COYS
Didn't understand a word but big up Kane!🙏
Kane has said he’d like to try as a kicker in the NFL when he retires from football… this is purely to put the thought out there in case people don’t understand why he’s doing this show…
Seeing this video was my WTF moment today🤨 so random 😂
He kind of everything
COYS!
Dear America, I promise we don’t all sound like that
My guy capping about playing fifa
wtf
Sorry Jimmy he hasn't won no awards especially trophies.
Random
LOL I curse that UK won't win until they just kick out trash can Maguire
Love Harry Kane, but he always sound like he's just come from the dentist and his mouth is frozen still.
Never expected kane on this lol😂😂i scouser support liverpool...
That guy hasn’t won 1 trophy! Not a single one! Not even by mistake!!! It’s coming home Harry 😂😂😂🫠
Why harry kane talked like he just got punch on the face? Is something wrong with his jaw?
Harry kane 💙💥
Hes such a Good guy Harry💙
Such a great footballer with a calm and down to earth personality.
What timeline are we in now. This is madness
Love Harry Kane what a player but he’s painfully boring to hear talk fml
The best english player
Zero trophies
He is extremely humble and respectful.. Rise more Harry ❤❤❤
Harry Kane hasn’t won shite and he’s comparing himself to Tom Brady?
“What gets you inspired?”….. NOT Trophies!
Countless awards🤨
even ishowspeed play more fifa than u jimmy, crista Ronaldo. SEWWWWWYYYYYYYY
Harry 'kind of' Kane
Jimmy Fallon clearly knows nothing about Kane and Spurs if he's calling him "the champ"
Harry seems a decent down to earth fella. It's a pity he's wasting his best years playing for spurs & never winning anything at all. I am sure he will regret it when he hangs up his boots.
how tf am i able to understand kane without subtitles 😂😂
Kind of
Champ of what?
So random lol
Harry Kane, the Champ 😂😂😂 got me creasing
mooh se supari tookh ke batkar re baba*..
Jimmy is having hard time getting what Kane is saying. 😂
He's the captain of the England National 'football' team.
Should of asked him how many trophies have Spurs won?
Harry "kind of" Kane.
The Champ!  Yet he's never won a trophy for Tottenham :)
Wtf
I didn't realize how bad Kanes lisp was :O
Soccer? What is that?
Harry "Kinda" Kane
When CR7 comes on this show , then I’ll be impressed
Jimmy had  no clue who he was talking to still . The important question he should of asked was about the group stage with USA
SO many trophiesTottenham hotspur or England 🤔 is it audi cup
How the hell did Harry Kane end up on Jimmy Fallon???
I cant believe this actually happened!! LOVE IT!!
This is by far the clearest I have ever heard Harry Kane speak
YIDDOOOOOO
As an Englishman I really wish they had subtitles for Harry Kane
This is so surreal I feel like it’s edited
Just a Wow.
Soccer 🤦‍♂️
70 pace and he plays him 👍🏻
kind of
Brady saw ronaldo score a hattrick against tottenham and then decided to come back lol
I have to say that he is the most important player in Tottenham, or at least in its offence. Sonny and Kulu can't do sh*t if it ain't for his passes and play making. I hope he, Sonny, Kulu, and Conte stays together at least 1 more year and they can win at least 1 trophy.
Just think all the Americans who thought we all spoke like Colin firth & then Harry Kane showing up….
Jamie vardy
What in the multiverse is this
I feel really bad for Kane, such a good striker yet no trophies whatsoever
Yeah he has no star quality…
Read between the lines, peeps! He's going to be playing for Miami FC next year. That could only be the explanation as to why he's on a US talk show.
Countless awards…LOL 😂
Kane is so dead on fifa lmao so cap
i'm surprised they got him on, but more surprised they can understand him.
Surprised there was no mention of England being in the same group as the USA.
Why is it champions league cartoon pops to my head every time I hear Harry speak?
Need a translation
Yet he’s won zero trophies. Shame!
When a football player makes into US talk shows, either they are one of the best or they just moved to MLS!
I can't believe Harry let Jimmy  say the "S" word, despicable
Jimmy's either really nervous around Kane or he has no idea about Football and is winging the interview.
💙💙💙Harry💙💙💙
his mouth never closes
Come on you Spurs
Is he joining mls? What's happening?
얼굴 합성으로 돌아다니는 케인짤같네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
LOVED THE JOKE AT THE END" HARRY KANE THE CHAMP" LMAO
That’s table football 🤣
No trophies
As boring as a cardboard box!! Fan of him as a footballleer
Will Ferrell in champions league final & Kane in jimmy Fallon’s show? So random 😄
He's never win any trophy actually, neither for club nor country
Tom Brady saw Ronaldo's hat trick and said fuck it, I'm coming out of retirement.
What language is Harry Kane speaking?
the subtitles were a massive help!
erh yeah obviously........
Yeah Jimmy definitely doesn’t play FIFA 😂
This is the great question for harry kane. "How is it feels like to be a captain that never lifting up the trophies? "
The most random video of Harry Kane I seen.
You can clearly tell that Jimmy has literally never played FIFA
My man Harry, banggin' more Kindof's than goals!! and that's a lot!!
Harry Kane is a crap footballer..
My insomnia very nearly turned into a coma
He used ( kind of ) a lot when he was speaking
This guy is the worst interviewer/ night show host
His English got better
Had Ronaldo been on this show?
COYS
'Harry Kane the champ'.... he hasn't won any trophies in his career 🤣🤣🤣
Thank god for subtitles 😂
One word about him as s striker    RELIABLE
Fuck i didnt expect that shit
A question instantly came up to me …   Why!!!!???
This man deserves to be playing for elite/bigger clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool, or City.
Such a random interview, completely boring questions plus completely pointless answers equals a complete waste of time.
Jimmy definitely doesn’t play fifa and definitely wouldn’t use Harry Kane if he did
6:48 "harry kane the champ everybody" lolll champ of bottling yes ?
Calling a Tottenham player a “champ”😭😭😭
WTF happen here?
Kane! Tell em it’s football not soccer!!!!!
SMH
What is he doing here?  *You've won countless awards* whhhaaaatt?? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great hearing him talking about all the trophies he’s won
@4:27  Jimmy: "The soccer team?" Harry: "**NO** you ignoramus, it's called footba...  I mean, yeah..."
Jimmy knows nothing about football but I’m here for it 😅 He is completely lost in this interview.
So great to see this!! One of my favorite players!! COYS!!
케인형 성공했구나
He will go to MLS one day
Harry Kane for LA Galaxy
Countless awards 😂 wat he won for team apart from individual awards
nah jimmy really said "you've won countless awards" 😭
Harry Kane on the tonight show 😂 who woulda thought
Yes
Jimmy is so fake from the starting. He knows only Kane from Fifa.
Can they understand him?
Who the fuck use Harry Kane in fifa?
I can't believe Kane in the States. COYS~~~!
Fuck me Americans are clueless
I like Harry Kane, even if he will be known as the greatest goalscorer to win no team trophies.
Never knew , Kane could even speak .
Wow Still hard to hear him talk
what is going on here?😂😂😂
Harry Kane is so boring how does he come on the show and not even make the crowd crack a laugh. Vanillas
He has won NOTING  major !!!!
kind of
4:00 is that where that one scene from the Champions season 1 was about? 😂😂😂 I wonder what that joke meant now i get it lol
Yeah obviously
My thought as I was clicking to watch, “will people from the states understand him?”
man said you are my fifa player 😄
kinda
Can the Americans even understand him 🤣
I’ve tried 3-4 times now but I just can’t get through it. It’s so awkward
Yh we really living in the metaverse right now. This is not making any sense. Like pineapple in a pizza, like dude wtf??
The UK have a football impressionist Al Farley who does a great Harry Kane, you should check him out
Harry I love u ricky skinner😍😍💪💪💪
Clive Allen kicked a few goals for the London Monarchs.  COYS indeed
Good to see Beavis has come home.
Fucking love Kane ! COYS! Let’s go England
Pity he’s a cheating bastard nice new teeth but 😂😂😂😂😂
He kind of speaks like his 442oons character
Too bad Americans don't think of real fooball as serious as the dumb American football nobody around the world really cares about LOL
Kane now on a week long recovery after holding in the word 'obviously' for the first time ever. Well done Harry!
Kane lowkey reminds me of Elvis idk why
헤리케인 내가 제일 사랑하는 축구선수!
Kane should have left spurs along time ago. Still outstanding for them but could have played at a bigger club.
Need to sonny too
I KIND OF liked this
I open YouTube and I see Harry Kane on Jimmy Kimmel I mean it's shocking to me but loved it please Jimmy more football player from Europe🔥
Topspur?
Jimmy Greaves was my boyhood idol and it speaks volumes for Harry Kane that I don't mind if he breaks Jimmy's goalscoring record for Tottenham.  Top man
👏👏👏🙆💚
"that's strange but i'll allow it"
Let's goooo Spurs!
I cannot believe this I was looking thrice to make sure that I saw Harry Kane on the thumbnail 😂 next Ronaldo please...
Alright get Pulisic on next
2nd goal was an OG, lol
God, he looks so nervous. Bless.
Who and what and why has this happened?? Harry do some voiceover work or something I don’t know about?? Random as a chocolate fire guard…
Woah! Couldn't believe my eyes! @@)
와 미쳣네
Man said “I play you FIFA” 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ You know he never played FIFA.
Jimmy wouldn't it be nice to interview Messi sometime in near future . He rarely does any tv media interviews , but you know we want to know more about his mentality , being so personal despite the greatest player of all time
Nice one, Harry
Harry Kane 🤣  , MBE  **"SCHOLES.........."**, My goat . What a player .
Even English people find if difficult to understand his speaking idk how the Americas dealt with it😂
Clearly a guy who’s never watched soccer
MAN CITY
You all should have seen my reaction when seeing this on my notifications
0:25 Won counts awards...Seriously....Jimmy he plays for Tottenham 🤣
????? i dont even play fifa but dont you play as a team
Jimmy, interview Heung-min Son!! That dude is arguably the most famous Korean in the world and I would dare say bigger than BTS!
King 🔥 Kane👑💙
Sounds like Don Corleone
Football *
whatever next....Giannis on Graham Norton? 🤔
“You’re my fifa player” that’s how you know he don’t play fifa lmao
Harry kane is quite similar with Steve Roger(captain America) am I right 😊?
It's funny how you call Harry Kane the "champ", Jimmy
I never think or even dream that one day Harry Kane, a professional English footballer would shows up in an America TV show. :))) !!!!!
James corden: harry why not me??
one of  best strikers in the world
I just realized that Jimmy speaks English pretty well
This feels very……weird but cool to watch
Love it...Try to bring Ronaldo if you can
What a dumb clip of him.. omg you kicked that ball with your boot? Omg what a kick
this is so random 🤣 😅 Harry Kane
Whys his eyes made up like a girl?? Ffs
해리가 왜 여기 있어? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
sonny도 같이 나왔으면 좋았을텐데
damn jimmy this is goat from euro
Fun fact: Harry Kane taps his thigh more times during this interview than he has goals this season
imagine if he won any trphies...
I was kinda shocking tho
So damn happy that one of our Tottenham Hotspur players is finally in a Jimmy show! He's one of our own, he's one of our own, Harry Kane, he's one of our own. From a Tottenham Hotspur fan 👍
Pan thuke bat kar rey baba
it all became comical when he was asked how many trophies have you won 😂
Laying the groundwork for the NFL kicker career
one of our own
Jimmy is so lying 🤥 who plays Tottenham when playing video games 🙄
"You've won countless awards" he have 0 trophys with Tottenham and England 😂
thought this was an old interview didn’t even clock
Even Doctor Strange didn't see this coming!
Jimmy basically letting you know he knows nothing about fifa. Probably never played
I really hope jimmy brings cristiano ronaldo next 😁👌
This is great from Jimmy to give him a job.
thats why its called Football (As its Foosball). NOT SOCCER!!!!
The best striker in the prem mate, #COYS
Americans must be thinking 'Bruce Forsyth's son is a talented lad'.
lmao kane has more followers than brady THE REAL GOAT lesgo
Looks like Busquets lil bit
Thats my boy. Coys Yid Army
Audi cup winner
He English is better on here rather than normally he got interviews post game with sky sports.
hem iyi bir bitirici hemde iyi bir insan
Doesn't he kinda look like Ryan Gosling?
I feel like this interview could be a part of an English listening exam here in Sweden...
Jimmy: eh... Howard?
Brady came out of retirement cause that day he saw Cristiano Ronaldo at the age of 37 shredding Tottenham  to pieces . And he came to see CR 7 😂😂😂😂
this is the most bizarre content to watch if you follow English football lol. he called him a champ haha
What a signing it would have been for us, but we got lakaka instead. Kane is the perfect modern day striker
This is unexpected but I’m here for it
Kane is American at heart. Love him.
You can talk about inspiration to succeed, but guys like Harry are a rare breed. That determination to be the best can't be taught. No wonder he and Brady get on so well.
Drinking game: down a tequila shot everytime Kane says 'kind of'.
Love this. Harry knows NFL as the Spurs Stadium actually transforms into a NFL pitch.
Will he pick up a couple of League Winning medals before retirement?
Do more on football player. ....😄
he set with a man call football soccer ball that's not weird at all 🤣
Holy shiet these Sports Players have a different built How small is jimmy looking lol Look at Kane's Posture and positivity These people are different....
How random was this by the way he’s not a super star 🤣🤣🤣
WTFFFF
oh my kane... nice guy
Imagine if cristiano ronaldo and Lionel messi came on the jimmy Fallon show 😶
Love Kane, glad Fallon wasn’t his normal annoying self and let him talk
It ain't fake?
Go Gunners! @AFC @Arsenal
The man!
Lmaooo. I never thought a soccer player would be featured in a show 🤣🤣
Jimmy is just so bad at interviewing and his energy is always so odd lol
2:30 and I've just realised I'm not even listening, still watching just not listening, wired huh
Jimmy pretending to play FIFA and knowing anything about football is the most Jimmy Fallon thing I've ever seen
Yea imma need subtitles
Yes...... Kane 🇬🇧
he said you've won countless awards hahahahahahah
Kane 💙🤍💙🤍
"You've won countless awards" 😂😂
저만 그런게아니군요 댓글에 뜬금없지만 재미있다란  말이많네요. This is so random
is this show from another parallel universe..?
Ahhh....@ timestamp 0:25, please list the 'countless awards' that he's won. Then list his trophies. He's a very good player and goal scorer but countless awards...come off it mate!
Harry Kane is the GOAT!!!!! The absolute epitome of class, sportsmanship, humility, and teamwork! #10 and the Spurs will be sporting some bling next year, better believe it!
Jimmy, you know damn well you don’t play FIFA
This one's the most ambitious crossover yet
"You've won countless awards"        "Except a trophy"
He looks like US Agent from The Falcon and The Winter Soldier series 😁
You could tell 80% of the audience had no idea what was going on 😂😂😂
Harry Kane the "champ" lol. The only thing he ever won is the runners up medal
Next up = HARRY MAGUIRE🤣🤣
Coming 4th at the World Cup isn’t one step short.
the amount of times Kane Sayed "kind of" is funny
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Harry kane is Good
Harry Kane is The bigger star in Tottenham Hotspur.
I actually understood Kane when he spoke, that’s weird
No way!!! Awesome
this freaking accent is pushing me to sleep
Harry Kokaine  🖖
This has got to be the most unusual guest to have on an american talk show. Kane is a fantastic player, just that seeing a Premier League star on Fallon is so unlikely.
One of our own
Kane:Sksoeirjtvvjssoaslkjrrtbrudi uhhhhhh akskrbtjeksozidruwowib Fallon: Fake laughter
Man Fallon is such a bad interviewer.
Couldn’t understand a word until I turned captions on. Fair play to Harry, stepping out his comfort zone
Yo what??!!!!!!?????
Invite Cristiano Ronaldo next.
wtf?
I just love the differences between these two accents
What in the multiverse is happening here
Kane has son done it with you?
Did he get a wisdom tooth out right before the show?
Nice to see Harry kane on Jimmy fallon 💯💯💯
My favorite player. This was an awesome interview. COYS
M
0:24 talking about awards to a tottenham player lol ,he's never watched football in his life before I guarantee it
TOTTENHAM COME TO CONQUER.
No Jimmy he’s a football player what is soccer
Hope he wins something with Conte.
I don't see anyone talking about that kick. I swear to god it looks like he kicked that from like 70+ yards  absolute rocket of a kick holy shit
"is he like david beckham's brother or something?" -yank
this is a weird crossover episode
00:20, YES Jimmy it’s called Soccer 😂😂
How is it that the interviewer is more awkward than the interviewee
“Countless awards” 😂
I'm YouTubebr aapke chanl see meri half ho sakti h
COYS!
"I play you on FIFA", yea jimmy has never played FIFA in his life
Would never have seen this coming! Kane comes across really well
From Geoff Shreeves to Fallon. WOW!
How many trophies has he won? Must be loads surely??
What about Sonny?
해리케인 천부적인 재능에 비해 커리어가 너무 아쉽다..다음시즌엔 무조건 트로피 들길 바라는 선수 1위! 너때문에 월드컵에서도 잉글랜드가 우승했으면 한다
Harry Kane once again in the presence of greatness and not deserved. Kane in the same room as Black Thought!
Fresh out of Tottenham securing Champions League qualification.
10 seconds in and i already want to die. Harry why did you do this?
Ahahaha harry Kane the champ he’s won fuck all
It's a shame that Harry can't talk about team sucess like trophies he has won when he attends shows like these
“When i play fifa you are my player” i bet anyone that watches football/plays fifa cringed as hard as i did 😂😂😂
Harry Kane is so boring, happy, and normal….. I love this man haha 😆
How is it that people can take the piss  make personal swipes (, mainly football fans of other teams in England )  out of people with a speech impediment . If it was because someone  had facial scars from being burnt, or was because he was diabetic  or had a heart defect   or a facial or bodily  impairment it would be totally ignorant and unacceptable . They were perhaps school bullies back in the day 😔
I go to New York    Manhattan every year to stay with friends .Best city    best people in the universe. As a Spurs fan from North. London  myself  I can say that Spurs are the most followed team in New York  couple of bars full of Spurs memorabilia because of the Jewish heritage . I have taken pics of Steve Perryman   Rony Rosenthial  Ossie and Ricky  to put up in the bar . 🍸
Come on you Spurs!!!!!!
Thank you Jimmy
What in the yankee doodle, Queen Elizabeth fuck is going on here??
I see that Jimmy finally got one half of Beavis and Butthead on his show!
Harry Kane will forever be the consummate professional and perfect role model for young football players.
He deserves a trophy but I don’t see Spurs winning trophies at this moment 🥴
Harry Kane, he’s one of our own 💙
Whenever they call it soccer......
Harry Kane is on Jimmy Fallon???Whats happening here😲
yeah obviously
Levy advertising the stadium through Kane. Anyway, Kane is a great guy and a fantastic striker.
My guy Improved his english
Wtf is Harry Kane doing on the tonight show
He’s one of our own 💪🤍
Harry Kane is fantastic, COYS Brazil.
Should be Scorpions came there also..and sing 🎤🎵 Here I am..rock you like a Harry Kane..🤟🎵🎶
countless award? more like 0 LOL
SCOLES     only the real ones know
unexpected
https://youtu.be/i-ppsRestg8
I watch Tom Brady documentary too.. its true, never give up and work hard.. I have 3 wife now.. Never Give Up!
kane is a fodder in FIFA
Harry getting his name & image out there in the States for when he plays NFL in a few years. Clever man.
Jimmy is not necessarily bias
"You won countless awards" hope he only meant individual awards 😅
This is so cringe
This is random, at first I thought it was an edited thumbanail.
Harry how many trophies have you won with Tottenham?
These are 2 people I would never associate with each other
Harry maguire will win England the next worldcup.
What trophies did Kane win?
🐐
So this means HK will be playing in the USA soon. He's trying to build his brand before he jumps ship. It's a good marketing ploy.  How many times did he say "Kinda"?
Great player, he deserves a lot of trophies in his trophy case. Next Miami FC recruit. But has he ever broken his jaw? I don't remember him having a jaw injury. His left side of his mouth up to the temporomandibular joint moves very little if any at all.
Wtf just happend
I always need subtitles listening to Harry Kane !!
“Your my guy on fifa” what a load of bullshit! Still great to see Harry Kane on though
Countless trophies Are you sure about that 😂
Notice how he has to say that Kane has won many AWARDS as he has won literally 0 major trophies.
I thought Jimmy would say thanks for all the trophies that would be so harsh and awkward 🤣🤣🤣
This feels illegal
Jimmy: I played you in FIFA video game Kane: really? Jimmy: yeah Kane: are you playing me with Tottenham or with another team in Career mode? 🤣
Idk who he is but he speak weird
He has won countless of awards but  Fam still has 0 trophy in his entire career, The only trophy he won was an Audi cup and that's not even a real thing😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
That was the game CR7 scored a hat trick, came to see CR7 not Kane 🤣
telling a bri'ish that football is soccer is an absolute joke
He’s a bot 🤖
As a New Yorker and a Tottenham fan, this was frickin awsome to see!!! “Harry Kane is one of our own~!”
hopefully kane big nose dosent score against usa, same group in world cup ?
Jimmy was lying about fifa and kane 🤣🤣
Two GOATS on the same table
"Blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blaaaah, HARRY KANE, blah blah blah blah blah".
https://youtube.com/channel/UCVzQH0dhXeGO1LDnyctZY1Q
WTF harry kane 😂
Him and Son are absolute ballers
spurs till i die
Subtitles turned on
COYS!!!!!!
Wtf  Good for you tho harry
FooSball💀
Bro got a twisted tongue 💀
He’s funny to me knowing’s he’s achieved just about as much as everyone in the comments
Kane is just another footballer, boring and media trained
Ryan Gosling is making a big splash on his new movie.
Yet he's won no trophies 😂🤭
Kind of
“ Harry Kane the champ “ Of what!?😆😂
?
why was it an all military audience?
Jesus save, but Kane scores on the rebound.
kane is so cute
Cheating, diving sniveling cretin
He's definitely worked on his public speaking, much better diction.  Americans must be super confused at who Kane even is, This man no wrestler"  major boon for the rest of the world though!
No trophy, that's sad, that's just sad
Ay what's Harry Kane doing here
He’s a great role model. Fantastic player and all round great person.
You can invite a football player to play for an NFL team but no NFL player could get on the bench of a premier league team that’s the difference and Tom Brady came out of retirement after marvelling at ronaldo single handedly ripping spurs a new one
Glad he's working on his English
“You won countless awards”. Jimmy had to be sure he didn’t say trophies.
Yeah obviously
I’d do anything for this man
Actually the best guest, to leave you speechless… I’m a Liverpool fan, and just ecstatic to see HK killing on late night American tv
why tf is harry kane on this
kane deserves to win a trophy🏆
He listed some awards he’s won, but weird that he didn’t mention any trophies…
Lesgooo Kane in Jimmy Fallon's show! Wow! COYS
Wow they provided subtitles as well to understand kane's English
100% Jimmy does not know anything about football😆
I bet hardly anyone knew who he was
#2 ON TRENDING
You won countless awards  💀💀 man don't know he is Tottenham player💀💀🗿
"you've won countless awards" Fallon surely doesn't know Spurs 🤣🤣🤣
Fun fact: He didn't say "obviously" this whole video, big achievement!
Kane going the MLS or something????
I see Jimmy didn't ask him how many trophies he had won?
Champ?? he hasn't won a trophy LOL
https://youtube.com/channel/UC9-oPSOpCYBhzxQzGzsq0qA
who the fuck is Henry kan
Come to Arsenal Prince Harry
Harry klass A Cocaine
Seeing harry kane of spur in the entertainnent show is very strang and not get twice so,i have to enjoy all the feelings i get in here
흥민이랑 맨날 경기장에서 보던 케인이 토크쇼에 있으니 어색하네 ㅋ
As an Englishman, this is strange
Watching a footballer on Fallon is like watching porn on TV.  It is that weird.
Jimmy you fraud knows nothing about fifa or footy 🥲Why didn't he get on John oliver
0:27 countless awards 😳
OG still helping Spurs after the season’s end.
Harry Kane looks like Hollywood there, like Ryan Gosling
World soccer......
one of the best striker that i hope play in Chelsea  😆
THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED MAN😭🤍 COYS
Hahahahahahaha this was weird to watch man 😂😂😂😂
Introducing the Most Overrated Player of All Time AKA MOAT  AKA Harry Kane
HARRY KANE IS ONE OF OUR OWN #COYS
Harry 'kind of' Kane
I think Kane is not the typical British player who’s arrogant and thinks they are better than every other player. He seems like a nice person.
🤣🤣🤣
Hey, Jimmy it might have been interesting to mention that Harry Kane will be an opponent of the USA in the first round of the WC. How did you manage not to bring this up? Poor interview.
trophy less journey. actually feel bad for him, he deserves trophies just unlucky to be playin in totenham
Waaauww… Harry Maquire of Man Utd...
No offense to Harry Kane, but honestly, how many Americans actually know who Kane is? The only Spurs Americans know are from San Antonio.
해리케인이 여기 왜나오노! ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Get Ronaldo on this
95% of the audience have no fucking clue of who Harry Kane is
Jimmy ask him how many trophies he's won.....terrible footballer why he's on this show god only knows
What I didn't accept that 😱
Kane going for the handshake and left hanging 😩😂
Such a down to earth guy and so professional. So weird seeing Harry on an American late night talk show though… was waiting for Sonny to come out from behind the sofa 🤣
Harry Kane LETS GO YOU spurs!
Jimmy : “ You’ve won countless awards “  Tottenham Fans : 👁👄👁
He's underrated. The Bleacher champion's league cartoon summed it all.
The game he's talking about was Man united vs tottenham , in which a cristiano ronaldo hat trick against tottenham won them the game 3-2, ronaldo is a legend of football and is one of the best strikers in the toughest league in the world , although he is 37 , which is 4-5 years beyond normal football retirement age and tom brady was inspired by that to come out of retirement
The audience were probably like who is this guy?  But to us England fans and across Europe hes a legend.
So everyone is just gonna ignore the fact that Jimmy said to Kane “ You’ve won many awards”.
Come on you Spurs!!!
I love Kane,
“Soccer” urgh.
Hazza is inspired to win the audi cup again
Hey hey don't insult Harry Kane by saying champ . He plays for Spurs . Spurs and being called champ , doesn't go hand in hand
kinda crazy that he was rubbish at age group. even his first few seasons on loan he was shit. but he drilled where the goal was and got his chance and took it. greatest english striker since shearer and fuck me kane behind shearer would be the most potent duo evevr
i play with you on fifa... enter fifa
Serial loser
🤴 👑  Harry Kane
Oh harry my boy, you're like if Sylvester Stallone had a lisp and fake teeth... really gotta listen in close
How can the American speak better than the English person
What an idiot asking Harry Kane to be a kicker
Really??? Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon 😵😵 Im a huge Tottenham Hotspur ⚽🐓 fan and Harry is my favorite player 🥰
This is so random
football*
Er er er er er er er er er, how many times did this guy say er? Did he go the the Wayne Rooney school of media training?
Shame he didn't have Sonny on with him too.
Multiverse vibes
Harry not bring his winners medals to show Jimmy?? Oh wait 😬
just a bunch of “hgh”
Yup, without subtitles I'm unable to understand Harry Kane🥴😂
why is this so awkward omg
Ye jimmy doesn’t play fifa and if he did he’d know kanes card sucks ass
Harry's a top draw striker but he's the most boring man alive.
Love ❤
MY CAPTAIN, COME ON THREE LIONS <3
it upsets me that most of the us do not know who he is is or care he is on the show
As he plays for Tottenham Hotspur FC he could practice on the NFL field at Tottenham  when the football pitch is removed for NFL games. 😂
WOOOOOOOTTTT
nice suit
So glad soccer is slowly bleeding over into US. Kane is a legend, and I'll be rooting for England perhaps more than my USA!
Crouchy and Camilla Cabello is better
Harry Kane has won something he has come on the show that's more trophies than Tottenham trophy cabinet
wow how fake is this interview
OK then😅😅
He speaks English!
Harry Kane in Jimmy Fallon... Wow... Never thought of it
This is one of the few rare moments where I can understand what Kane is saying
I know it's already been said but this is so random!
Boring AF! You could see JF thinking 'Fuck My Life'!
Hwhaht?? 😂 did not expect Harry Kane on the Tonight Show.
Can just tell Fallon has no idea about him hahahaha
Guess he's lining up an mls transfer
Lol Americans must be who the fuq is this guy 😂
what does jimmy mean he plays as harry kane on fifa? does he realise it's a team sport lol?
What’s even unreal about this is that jimmy said he won countless trophies 😂 😂lol
Never seen a museum about a player who hasnt won anything
0:26 if by countless Jimmy means not winning Premier League, Champions League, Euro or World Cup, then yes.
The guy is a beast on the pitch!
Fake.
Harry Kane 💪
Respect Harry from a CFC fan
It's penalty kane
Bloody hell 4 away from being wa all time top goal scorer??? That kind of just krept up on is how time bloody flies and a always kind of wanted Shearer to be top but Kane is pure quality and Rooney is an all time great so.
Harry Kane 😱😱😱
Fair play to Harry Kane, struggles to speak English but still goes on American TV, a true role model
It is interesting that Americans know about footballer Harry Kane, they also know Son heungmin???
Peter crouch need to go on jimmy fallon
Get heung min Son
He’s one of our own, HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN! HARRY KANE, HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN! Those who know, know 😉 COYS!
One of our own 🤍
“HARRRYYY KAAAAAANNEEE HE SPITS WHEN HE TALKS”
COYS!
Jimmy: wishing him gl for the world cup etc Me: I don’t think you should be doing that considering you will play England in the group stage
Well Jimmy knows nothing about European football but it was nice to see Harry on American TV. Note - Harry is 1 of the best PK takers in the Premier League but it's not the same as kicking field goals in the NFL. Different skill set. COYS
The best player in the PL next to De Bruyne. He’ll score a hat trick against the US this winter!
This is the weirdest thing I've seen. This makes me think that they're trying to americanise our sport.
Wtf is Kane on The Tonight Show?
He doesn’t have much to do so he just shows up anywhere
We want to see Sonny on the late night show too!
He's one of our own!  💙
Harry...Harry kane..is that you?? Yeah obviously
Total LEGEND   BRILLIANT GUY
"You are my fifa player when i player video game" - Fallon couldnt go 2 seconds without lying
I know I'm stoned but what did I just watch ;)
What multiverse is this?
I adore Kane. True hero but such a waste of one of the worlds greatest footballers to spend half the interview talking about American football. Perhaps it was a decision from Kane but I would have liked him talk more about his experience in his sport with his team Tottenham Hotspur.
Him trying so hard to speak in american accident 😂
Can tell Kane's quite good at foosball whereas Jimmy's probably never played in his life lol
Kane is pronouncing some of his words like an American - he's been influenced!
need a translater for those who r listening to kane for the 1st time
Jimmy chatting bs. “I play you when I play fifa” 😂😂😂😂. Ps this is the clearest I’ve ever heard Harry speak.
As a Liverpool fan a lot of time for this lad .a good honest brilliant footballer .
Love this! Great to see Harry get some love stateside.
Random, but my dog’s name is also Kane : )
Pov your name is buzzing
Countless awards ask him where his trophies at
Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspurs 👏
As a British person I have to ask .. what the fuck is going on 😂
Nobody plays with Kane in fifa 😅
OVERRATED
It wouldn't surprise me, after all this, if Harry Kane breaks the all-time England goalscorer record against the USA at the World Cup.
COYS
Is this the first time he has had a guest who doesn't speak English?
Props to jimmy for understanding Harry.. been watching him for over 5 years still find it difficult to understand him..
Coys🤍🤍
What?
Kane is a classr act all around. Beautiful family. Never been in any trouble. Kept his head down and is on course to break the premier league goal record.  Tottenham all day everyday day
What a superb interview and with such honesty , so happy to see Harry hotspur being chilled , come on you spurs
Why is Harry Kane suddenly on Jimmy Fallon?
Sounds like he’s talking while brushing his teeth
Does he have a cold? His voice sounds weird.
he is so NOT funny but so damn flawless in front of the goal
No way he said Southgate was a really good coach with a straight face 😂
This is so weird!
100M pounds kicker? 🤔
What a charming, eloquent and witty conversation between two classy, well spoken and highly interesting men..Nah I’m kidding
Bloody hell, TESCO
Pathetic
My name is Kane to
Never expected to see the big man on an American talk show lol, good on him.
Won allot of trophies????😅😅
as a spurs fan love kane he transformed into a out and out player and he proper down to earth geeza always honest and looking to keep getting better
COYG
Your job is to be a footballer. go do it
A shot of tequila everytime kane says “kind of” on this video
This that Pineapple on pizza type duo
I dare you everytime Kane says "kind of" to take a shot 😅
Do they know what he’s saying
why tf  is he here?
More real footballers pls not American sissy handball
Harry Kane just did a 7m12s interview and didn’t say obviously once, I’m shocked
Hell yeah das mAh boi
Harry Kane being on Jimmy Fallon makes as much sense as triangle.
Kane with Jimmy not James that's surprising.
He literally only score penalties.
Get Sonny on the show Plz🥰🇰🇷
You've won countless awards.... 🙃
Is he speaking Swahili
....or you could watch him play for Tottenham....
Jimmy...Youve never touched Fifa! Loool Stop lying!
harry kane won nothing why is he even on there lol FA try so hard to make this guy the face in english football but his won zero and plays for a bunch of bottle jobs! FA want him to be the face on englands WC team but no one knows him lol
I didn’t know this guy could speak English
Is Harry lost? How's he ended up on American TV???
5:21 its easy when you play teams like Albania, San Marino etc😂
Harry is a good guy.
this is good to see, as it means his PR team is buttering him up for the USA and we may be able to get rid of him from the England team coz hes been shit for years in the England team! whole team has to base itself around getting him penalties
Did they both forget that England will play the US?!
american peolple seeing kane as master player. rest of the world seeing a normal player.
Harry Kane .....As Charismatic as a Dead Mouse
Harry wasn’t anything at 18. Where he is now is remarkable.
I hope this is like NBC's way of building an audience for the World Cup in the Fall. It would be cool to see more of these interviews
Kane's publicist must have had strong connections.
"You're one of the top soccer players in the world" - the dude is not watching soccer. I can give 10 players that are rated above Kane.
YIDS!
As an American Spurs supporter, this is awesome!
IM A SPURS FAN LOVE U HARRY COYS❤️
You should've invited Zlatan Ibrahimovic!
He's One of Our Own !!!! Yid ARMY  !!!
Hey Harry, whoever told you that you're at the Sky Sports studio, they're lying to you.
Love Harry, was obviously out of his comfort zone but did brilliantly! #harrykane #oneofourown #coys
Harry Kane is not a champion he has never won nothing only golden boots which is not what team plays for and no I am not an Arsenal fan
This is so random on Jimmy Fallon show lol
Wait Kane's gone to America? Nice!
The champ 😂😂😂
Now let's get that UCL title next year!
Just letting all you americans know, we don’t all speak like this
Huge Tottenham fan here state side and this is just wild!
Man like Harry the goat Kane 💙
Yeah obviously
Soccer team jimmy? Really?
Harry Kane of Jimmy Fallon seems so bizarre.
I laughed when jimmy got shocked he made the 50 yard shot not knowing kane's right foot has better accuracy than the best usa homing missiles 😂
I feel bad for Harry cannot win a single trophy for Tottenham and national competitions are very hard i’m hoping he gets a big move
A fine ambassador for us
He must win some trophies to be a champ, bold accusation Jimmy!
LOVE HARRY KANE! Such a good role model!
I’m so confused why he is here. Did not expect this
"Harry Kane.. ladies and gentlemen, the champ" (who had not won any trophy 🤣🤣🤣)
“You have one countless awards “🤣🤣
Jimmy: "You've won countless awards" lol
This is fucking wierd
You've won counts of awards, clearly you haven’t done your homework Jimmy!
it's football, not soccer
Well done Harry, came across very well.
Harry missed out on a great chance to slag of arsenal...
OMG KANE AND JIMMY!?  THIS WAS UNEXPECTED BUT ALSO AMAZING
FUCKING SCHOLES
"you've won countless awards"  not so sure about that one...
„You won counts of awards”   lol
ONE OF OUR OWN, HARRY KANE 💙🐓
How many of Jimmy's goals did kane claim?
So are American millioners going to take over the epl?
No americans kane doesnt have something in his mouth...
I didnt understand a word kane said, lovely interview this!
What's next? Jimmy Bullard on Jimmy Fallon?
Love how they cut out the intro when he introduced Kane as the champ, when he’s never won a major trophy his entire career lmfao😂
Ask him how many trophies he's won
this is weird seeing a footballer on an american night show aha
harry kane > swagger
it felt so weird to see him for the first time 😅
As a spurs fan from america who has watched jimmy fallon quite a lot, this was awesome
Wth going on here
Americans!!!! Just know here in Britain 🇬🇧 we also don’t understand kane
I felt like this is the multiverse or something cause its so random
finally 1 trophy for Kane
He plays for Tottenham Hotspur so he's won no trophies at all! And his tongue is too big for his head, it'd be amazing if Americans could understand him.
Harry Kane has failed his career prospects staying at a club like Tottenham! Should have moved to clubs that have won or are winning instead of a club that got a trophy cabinet full of emptiness!! Ruined his own career!
Fallon has no idea what he's talking about
Good footballer but 0 trophies...
It's not soccer mate!!
You won countless awards 💀(atleast not team awards)
He wouldnt be the first professional footballer from England to kick for the Jets.
This felt like another reality
COYS!
‘Got me where is am today’ yeah winning fuck all 😂😂
jimmy "you have won countless awards " meanwhile plays in Tottenham
What is Harry Kane saying?
They couldn’t have picked someone less articulate 😂😂😂
Shocked to see this COYS
harry kane megastar
Zero trophies.
How the hell the American audience understood him I don't know, considering how fucking stupid his voice is! Up the chels 💙
Love Harry Kane even as a Chelsea fan. 🤣
Zero trophies
Jimmy is so freaking fake man...the opening line is the definition of genuinely fake person.
This is so weird. I can't get used to this. Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon's show? Why are they acting like this is normal? This is one of the strangest crossover ever lol
What is Harry Kane doing here lol?
Harry kane 😂
Would love to know the percentage of people in the audience who actually follow his career (Kane)
fuck tottenham
If you told me when I saw him score his first ever senior goal for Leyton Orient against Sheffield Wednesday in 2011. That one day he’ll be a guest on the tonight show l. I’d ask you too give me some of those shrooms you’re on. All the successful he has had is totally deserved though.
Not sure how this happened, but thank you for bringing him on the show!!
I thought for a second that he is dutch :)
Should have asked him about how many cups he's won as a player.
Finally Jimmy got a footballer.... hoping for more
Wtf what's Kane doing here hahaha haha fs
You’ve won countless awards but no trophy’s.
석대 왜이렇게 귀엽냐
football Football guys! not soccer soccer what? Football!
wow so awkward
FUCKIN CHANCES SCHOLES
Tammy Abraham is winning trophies, Kane is doing talk shows. Difference.
I like Harry's humble approach. He works hard. That's the simple secret. (As my teacher used to say "one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.")
I think some guys are missing the obvious. Harry has a firm sense of what he’s trying to achieve in his career and he said a few years back he’d like to play in the NFL as a kicker after he retires. He’s cleverly getting his face known on American tv and gradually he’ll appear a few more times so that he can transition to the NFL in 5-6 years time, smart move.
COYS
Ay! Great to see Kane on the show! COYS!
Nice to see he's gained enough confidence with the language to go on a talk show
Harry Kane is shit fucking hate Tottenham
The most boring guy I’ve ever seen on this show
It might be just me but fallon calling it soccer and Kane not correcting him just really bugs me. Also Harry Kane liking NFL annoyes me but that’s his choice.
Lol Jimmy trying hard to know about FOOTball
Come on you spurs!!!!!
Yido! Yido! Yido! Yido! Yido! Yido! He is one of our own! One of our own! Harry Kane!
Harry kane has been my idol since 2014 and been a big Jimmy fan too , I cannot but this into wotds
HARRY KANE, HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN
Well, this was a surprising crossover! 😀
This is the union we all unknowingly wanted
Doctor Strange and that damn multiverse putting Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon
This Harry guy has better English than Kane tbh
It's kind of nice
Wow What is Harry doing here all of a sudden? But I love it
Missed an opportunity to ask him about the USA World Cup group stage matchup.
뭐여 케인이 왜 여기서 나와?
He won numerous awards but no trophies COYS ;)
“You’re one of the best players in the world” Kane: nods  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is my striker on the Jimmy Fallon Show😂 COYS
Now I understand why Sonny says “I mean….” with every other sentence
Brady saw Cristiano score a hatrick and thought retirement wasn't for him😭😂
Listen how jimmy says harry won many awards but not trophies 😂.Jokes aside one of the best players currently active.
This is so random but entertaining
케인! ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
COYS
He needs to have Mourinho on the show 😂😂
I actually thought this was from years ago and I can’t believe it was recently kane will be the englands top score in 2 games
Literally the best and most complete footballer in the world
Welcome to America harry
England Captain!💪
You won countless awards 🤔
Nahhh they violated putting the subtitles on straight away 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wtf?🤔Harry hasn't won a trophy in his whole career and now he on the fallon show.😆
Next invite Harry maguire, he's the Lord of football.
"Yhea Jschimmy Thanksch fwor vaving mie hier"
This is rare, please get Ronaldo sometime.
0:21 you won countless awards….  He is Tottenham……
As Arsenal, it’s weird seeing him on jimmy falllon. He is a nice guy but I absolutely can not stand Spurs and their fans.
Fuck me...”you’re my fifa player..” American talk shows are so fake and don’t even make an effort to pretend they’re not
Man said u have won countless awards 😭😭😭
Jimmy fallon had the opportunity to ask "For the world cup game USA vs England" who do you think will win?
Jimmy Fallon 100% bullshitting😂😂😂
Harry, don't play too much American sports.... Conte wants you to target the much smaller European goal :D
Jimmy is clearly a liar as you don’t play a specific player in fifa. Boomer
👀😆👍🏻🫶🏻🤍
I am so confused as to why Harry is on here 😆. I had to double check it wasn't a clip from the Graham Norton show or Wossy lol.
wow i can see who Sonny gets his dialect/way of speaking  from haha they sound so similar
Did he do a whole interview without saying "yeah obviously"?
When two worlds collide
COYS!
Love you Harry! Tottenham till I DIE!!
Of course Jimmy likes to play FIFA! Ask Nicole Kidman :)
This is so unexpected 😆
This is random as it gets hahahahaha
Harry Kane is a LEGEND!!
Never expected Harry Kane to appear in the Tonight Show 🤯
0:04 hmmmmm why do I not believe this gentlemen lol
COYS
The best striker in the world
so this is what multiverse feels like.
Is this real??
Harry Kane!  Legend!!!!  We love you.  COYS
Is this guy a soccer player
EPL is pretty famous in the States these days. They're showing it on NBC, USA network, paramount+ etc
Wtf 😂 who the hell expected Harry Kane to go on here
COYS💙🤍
Football, not soccer.
MY 🐐
COYS 💙!!
Harry 'Kind of' Kane
Harry kane has his own accent ✌️ Love this man
It like he's talking with food inside his mouth
This lad is the one who got me into football and I'll be forever grateful. What a player! One of our own 🤍
Football not fucking soccer
Bet they had to mop the floor of his drool afterwards
Jimmy speaks better English than Harry Kane. Come, we was...
Kane held himself well there, It had to have been hard with some of those questions from Jimmy.
This man was not elected to represent us.
Living legend
Im so glad for invited professinal football player,
Harry Kane is the most complete striker right now, he's the best striker at being a play maker and also one of the striker with most accuracy I've seen. He's incredible, I'm a fan of  him even if I don't support Tottenham per se. The pair of him and Heung Min Son is crazy
Harry Kane is such a great role model, like he's got the talent but also carries himself really well and comes across as incredibly diligent and hardworking but also very grounded. A true captain through and through!
What he’s saying?
We also look forward Son Hyong Min.
Harry looks especially dashing here 😮 The suit looks nice
Countless awards but no trophies
He can take over from James Corden
Tbh people just hate his english for no reason ,i understood each and every word he said !!
Don't think Jimmy even knew who Kane was before the show, find it even harder to believe that he plays FIFA,  let alone picks Kane as his striker and then wins😂😂
"you won countless awards" lol
Kaneeeeeee !!!!!!!
Sounds like a dog with peanut butter on the roof of his mouth
coys coys coys
Could the American audience understand him?
Next up- Jimmy fallon interviewing Pep guardiola  How random that would have been
Who do you guys think wins the Champions League? Madrid or Liverpool?
Such cap 🧢 . No way he uses Kane with his dead pace on fifa 😂😂😂😂
i can't stop to watch this
This https://youtu.be/DrBIihzjy6E is what happened. Original Music #ThaDose
I saw a friend of mine perform on Letterman with his band - THIS is weirder, and by some degree.
Jimmy Fallon does not play fifa
Second most random crossover in football history. First of course is CR7 with Lil Wayne
Jimmy clearly doesn’t play fifa saying Kane’s his favourite player😂
Kane's American accent is really Good.
Well that was crap
come on you spurs
People say Jimmy lies about playing FIFA, legends know he does play FIFA as he’s a big fan of video games. The man ditched Nicole Kidman just to play video games 😅
Was Kane speaking English?
I thought  Big H did great. COYS👏👏👏
what great team?
This feels like a fever dream
Kane da 🐐 no 🧢!
Hey Jimmy - heard of Son Heung Min ? Apparently he is the bees knees at Tottenham and the whole of South Korea . Get him on.
Come on you Spurs
Cool story about Harry Kane and Tom Brady.
Lol “awards”. Not trophies.
Climate crisis > football, if we care about the next generations of people at all
So much love for that man 🤍🤍🤍
Harry Kane, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and other legendary players are a perfect role model for us!👍👍👍👏👏👏
This is the equivalent of a polar bear in Texas.
Can’t believe he played in red 🤢 I’d have spun that table around straight away!
Such a down to earth genuine guy too content!!
jimmy, next week invite Harry Maguire
0:24 I LOLed

https://youtu.be/faIJcKbM28Y
One of the most humble guys in the sport🙌🏻
He’s worse at public speaking than when Beckham first emerged. Nice chap, great player but how did he get this gig? Stick to goals and assists Harry.
The way Kane speaks is over-mocked by people, I'm clearly able to understand everything he's saying
Do one with Virat Kohli and dhoni
Better English then harry kane
Foosball is a fun game!!
I bet when Jimmy Fallon was told he is gonna interview Harry Kane,he mostly likely said who.
I was wondering if anyone understood what he said
Omg kane 💙💙💙
Thank you very much
The Audience is like “ fuck , we finally got tickets and it’s some soccer player … “
hell yea
Yall gnarly americans dont know how good this guy is and what a legend he is!
Rate Kane, very humble. Shame he won't win a trophy at Spurs
Why is Harry Kane on here
Harry Kane great player sad he plays for a small club.
super Harry.
arsenal are in the mud 😂😂😂😂
They used to call him one season wonder. And now im confused that did he really scored 183 goals in one wonderful season? #ONEOFOUROWN
4k res Tbd >?
Wtf is he doing in the US?
Rock me a like  Harry Kane. COYS!
The guy on the left still has better english than Harry Kane
For any Americans who don't know much about "soccer" Harry is a really good footballer, don't let the fact that he has never won anything colour your view of him, it's virtually impossible to win anything if you play for Tottenham
seems so weird looking at him without a jersey 🤣
The journey of a rich kid
the amount of times he said "kind of"
One of the best strikers in the world. It's great seeing football players being on American TV talk shows. I'm an United fan, but he is one of my idols. What a player ♥️
harry kane #COYS
Champions league for Spurs  Europa for assanal
This feels like something in a parallel universe.
It looks super weird
🐐 COYS
If ever an interview needed subtitles it's this one
This is very uncomfortable and awkward. Why Harry Kane of all players?
"Won countless awards" clearly someone doesn't understand spursy
COYS
He called him Harry Kane "The champ"...hmm, im a football fan, when did that happened?
This is random. For any non-football (soccer) fans out there, Harry Kane is a really good player. He's arguably in the top 20 players in the world at the minute. However, he's not really what you would call a 'superstar'. It's almost like Donovan Mitchell rocking up in the UK and going on the Graham Norton show. I mean, I'm all for it, but it's just a bit weird.
much respect for Kane. a true professional and role model
You’re my Fifa player. Singular player. This guy does not play fifa, can confirm
Jimmy has never played FIFA😀😀
he defo dont play fifa
Harry Kane on the Tonight Show for all 2 people who know him in America.
Zlatan and Kane 🔥
Two words.... "KIND. OF".
Woah this was unexpected but worth it
Harry fuckin Kane! He’s One Of Our Own #COYS
COYS COYS COYS COYS COYS 🤍🤍🤍
This crossover was certainly not needed
Subtitles please 😛😛
Countless awards?????? What millwall young player of year?
I’m asking what everyone else in the comments is asking  How and why????
COYS COYS
wtf is harry doing here 😂
Goooooooooool D HURRICANE Goooooooooool.  Mr International.  The World Cup Golden Boot kid.
Kane seems like a genuinely normal guy, just so happens to be a fucking monster on the football pitch
This is so WEIRD
This is so weird to see him on fallon! Kane is a legend!💜👍⚽️
HES ONE OF OUR OWN HARRY KANE HES ONE OF OUR OWN
https://youtu.be/iufDyypYc6M
Didn’t understand a word
The lack of "Good Luck at the World Cup except game 2" type bants was disappointing but seeing EPL infiltrating culture outside of sports is great for the game over here. COYS
Not much to say, but an absolute profesional and  truly nice family guy, that  all the UK lancashire media are obsessing over non stop  and sadly and patheticly brings out the trolls in their droves with their nasty bigoted comments  every time it's such a bad example of part british society
He's one of our own, he's one of our own! Harry Kane, he's one of our own!!! COYS! 🦁🦁🦁
What multiverse of madness is this ? 😂
American have no clue ... how much of a big superstar he is. He is a megastar TBH.
I just want to apologise to all Americans who struggle to understand Harry Kane talk .  It's a very different London now to what you might expect , and this is how most Londoners below the age of 30 speak .  This is due to mass immigration into London , and that means that the white kids growing up in London started to talk like the black boys in school , usually to try and fit in with the masses .  When i was at School in the mid to late 80's there was maybe 5 out of the 32 kids were from 'different backgrounds' now you would be shocked to see more than 2 white kids in a class of 32   and this is the end product of Tony Blairs Labour Government , opened up the fllodgates and boy did the world flood in !! Brexit has come too late to stop this as the damage has now been done. Put it this way , If you come to London England on Vacation guys you will seriously wonder what country you are in and will leave dissapointed with your trip .  The famous cockney accent has died , and this is  now normality .  Anyway thank god for the subtitles as even I have to listen real hard to make sense when he talks .
Nepal 👍👍👍😎
Suuuuuiiooi Ronaldo play ▶️▶️▶️
A lot of love ❤️ from Nepal Kathmandu
So weird to see him in the show time world
Hala Madrid king 🙌👑❤️
Suuuuuiiooi Ronaldo
Wtf? Kane on Jimmy Fallon, weird
Jimmy is such a liar. NO ONE use Harry in fifa. He’s slow AF in the game
A humble person. Respect bro
he is one of our own.coys!
He's one of our own harry kane!
One of our own.
I did NOT expect this
His face when jimmy said he’s won countless of awards 😂
So weird to see a British football legend on an American chat show 😅
Lol 😆  didn't expect to see our H on jimmy #COYS
oviesly
COYS!!
Absolutely LOVE you MR KANE!❤️ you are. SOLID GOLD!   KANE—>DUDE with Most vicious hog, most threatening HOG  Go you SPURS❤️
So if Tottenham players are doing the late night circuit, I guess Arsenal players must be doing those weird infomercials you see come on late on a Thursday night…
Why’s there no bottles on the table ? Ultimate bottler
Even in England no one is able to understand him, surprised how anyone in the US would be able to as well
This interview is the one we needed without knowing it
Ronaldo Scores a Hat-Trick and Tom Brady comes out of Retirement ;)  The GOAT inspires another GOAT.
I love Harry Kane but didn’t he say ‘kind of’ too many times here
Does he have a speech impediment?
Oh dear, Jimmy: 'the soccer team?' 😂😂😂😂 no, man! The football team❤️🤘🖤 so glad this man has not left Tottenham on hard times
💛💛💛
Goat
Harry Kane doesn't even speak English 🤣🤣, how the fuck the Ameircans understood a word he said is beyond me hahaha.
His english is getting better good for him
Not gonna lie, I died out of laughter when Jimmy said Kane won countless awards
"Harry Kane, the Champ!" - champ of what exactly, Jimmy? Audi Cup? He's at Tottenham dude, he never won shit 😂
Top player
“Seeing the society that the Cuban people were attempting to build inspired me to believe it was possible to arrange a nation’s priorities to meet the needs of the majority of its people instead of just those of its corporations and super rich” -Iris Morales (1948-, Planet Earth)
Attributing his success to Tom Brady is brilliant
Humble
Multiverse of madness is a real thing 😂 harry kane on jimmy fallon wtf
Should've had Gazza on
Our Talisman... He's one of our own.  COYS
Why the fuck is Harry Kane on jimmy fallon hahahaha
What in the world am I watching?? I read the title like 4 times before I convinced myself that yeah it's Kane alright. Now I'm watching it and I'm back to thinking it's some type of fever dream I'm having..wild
So awkward but what a guy!
Get him on Cordens show where he can shine.
Legend
Okay first thing first, he definitely doesn’t score with Kane on FIFA😂😂😂
He’s one of our own, harry kane!!!!! Coys!!! Best striker!!!!
"I play YOU when i play FIFA.....the video game" "Score goals?" "Yes KANE!!!!!" I struggle to understand why this unbelievable lie of a praise was needed.🤣🤣 Everybody knows he didn't know who he even was till that day.😂😂
Who the heck is Harry Kane? Is he related to Michael Kane? Never heard if him. Mind you, i have never heard of Jimmy Fallon, either.
Wtf
this is so random 🤣🤣glitch in the matrix 🤣🤣🤣🤣
what is soccer??
two worlds colliding.
“I play you” 😂😂no mr fallen no you don’t 😂😂😂
Jimmy fallon and harry kane is as confusing a pair as camilia cabello and harry kane
I feel like I'm in an alternate universe.
God i love harry #coys
Harry Kane will become the greatest England goal scorer…he will also become the premier leagues greatest goal scorer FACTS. Not bad going really
it’s only right i say it “it’s coming homeeeee”
Not a spur fan but I do love to watch this guy on the pitch.
This is one of the most random and weird things I've seen lately on television.....seeing Harry Kane in the Jimmy Fallon show.
How many trophies?
Im so confused. Why is he on this...... Fuck spurs anyway.
What is Harry doing in a fool's show, in a country where they say 'soccer'?
Harry Kane deserves better than Spurs tbh. However I'd love Tottenham to achieve true greatness.
For those that don’t know Harry Kane is Tom Brady levels of talent in soccer in the UK.
Thank god there are subtitles, cuz Harry Kane basically speaks another language
"Countless trophies"?
Need my boy Saka on next
They're trying to push soccer/football in the states to get it more popular. It is actually getting more popular now
He called him Harry Kane the champ but he hasn’t ever won a trophy 🤣. I hope that changes at the World Cup this year.
You've won countless awards, but no trophies :)
I see dead people
Harry...not enough is said about his passing...some of TH's best goals this season were a result of a pinpoint pass from Harry that few could see...much less make. Kulusevski's v NC being one of so many. On par with KDB's best passes. So happy to have him, Sonny and Dejan on the front line. Of course, the gaffer knows what he has in 'arry...and loves it.
The only thing rivalling the randomness of Kane in The Tonight Show is Mourinho at Tottenham
Didn’t expect this lmao
Watched Harry Kane playing in the Euro Cup last year. A good captain, did very well under pressure. A tough athlete for sure.👍
Harry - Class-A-you-know-the-rest..  -Expressions Oozing Sauce
Can’t wait for Danny ings to be interviewed and or Patrick bamford any English striker that hasn’t won anything in football and I mean nothing  🥳🥳
jimmy fallon plays Kane on fifa? he only plays one player? Bet he meant ultimate team, but if he did play ultimate team, he wouldve said it
Is it me or does he talk like he's got braces all the time
Are there subtitles available?
Harry Kane he spits when he talks 🤣
Why didn't they talk about his trophy collection?
will be a very small museum.. will only have Audi Cup in it 😂
Can I be the first one to say that in fifa Kane is so bad compared to real life
Didn't even know Kane is known in US or that people know who he is
Wicked, I watch every prem game and the tonight show, seeing a British footballer on here is pretty awesome, should defo do more. Get Jordan Henderson on there haha
It’s weird to see him in a suit . 😂
Nice interview but I wouldn’t say ‘countless’ awards
Harry Kane on Jimmy fallon...  Wow!!  Love this
쿨 해리 케인!
why this feels like scripted questions & answers
HARRY KANE IS A SCOUSER IN DISGUISE!   WELCOME TO LIVERPOOL KANE! ❤
Almost collapsed with laughter when Jimmy said Harry has won many awards 🤣
The man has made it kimmel next. COYS⚽️⚽️🏆
Come On You Spurs!!!  Might be the first active premiere league player to have ever been on an American late night talk show.  Crazy.  But yeah..could've at least mentioned that he played for Tottenham or Spurs, not just English team captain.
"You've won countless awards"- Jimmy Fallon, 2022
He’s one of our own!!!💙🐐
Harry was good value. I'm sure he will be on TV a lot more.
This is weird 😂 I'm a Chelsea boy and HATE Spurs. But I quite like Kane.
Haaaaaaryy haaaaaaaryy kaneee
Media telling us soon we're holding the World Cup...
"You're one of the top soccer players in the world"  Just another clasic jimmy fallon being dumb moment.
coys coys coys coys coys coys
Ive watched it with subtitles.  I don’t understand Harry 🤔😂
Use your words Harray.
You gotta invite ronaldo or messi
This is so fucking random lmao, but Jimmy had to say move from spurs if u want to win some trophies lol
0:04 False nonsense like this is why I cant watch American TV presenters (Corden included, I dont just mean Americans). He is talking such BS.
Harry Kane on The Tonight Show? Never thought I'd see that.
What a surprise. England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 skipper Harry Kane on the Jimmy Fallon Show. Kane has cracked America 🇺🇸
As long as it's not Harry Maguire on this show..
Coys
this fallon guy is so lucky that kane accept his invitation
This was class Kane's such a legend
Harry Kane felt very awkward in front of camera
This is the weirdest Fallon interview I'd never thought I'd see...
Well this was random
You're my guy in FIFA!! Such an American comment hahaha
What?! Harry Kane is on??? That's so fucking weird.
I noticed jimmy kept on mentioning kanes England record because there's nothing really to say about tottenham 😂😂
Great striker, complete as hell but my question is... What the hell is soccer?
I thought there was more chance of me seeing a pig fly in the sky than seeing kane on the jimmy fallon show 😂
There is no way there gunna understand kane over there , we can't even understand him here 😃
What a weird interview. They bring on an English-football superstar and what they talk about is...Tom Brady, the Marines and the World Cup? It's like they thought "ok, what are some things the Americans are going to understand?".
Tottenham Hotspur legend right their
What an unexpected guest ... What a player though .. a complete footballer and unselfish player
Does anyone else think he has something in his mouth? Idk
Jimmy stared in a film called The perfect Catch. It was based on a book by Nick Hornby which turned into a theartre play and made into a film called Fever Pitch. It stars Colin Firth and Mark Strong. The player scored the last minute goal against Liverpool is Micheal Thomas. If it wasn't for him. Jimmy would not met his future wife.
Arsenal fans probably turned off 😂
Great video but Kane never won a champion 😭😭😭
Harry Kane you know 😂😂😂😂 I did not have him down as a talk show guest, he seems like he hates interviews LMAO
Harry kane is our man💪
What on earth is this absolute plank doing on Jimmy Fallon.
What an awkward interview nobody knows who Harry, and even as a English tottenham fan I can't understand him sometimes with the way he talks
countless awards 🤣
More appearances on jimmy fallon than trophies
Do many of you guys (Americans) know who this guy really is?
wow. for sure he will try being a kicker in american football someday. would be a great watch.
Harry felt so offended when he called it "soccer", Harry must have been like 'oh I am in that part of the world'🤣
FC Bayern needs a new No. 9. Common Harry...
Am not sure why he is calling him a "champ", Harry Kane has not won any silverware during his career 😆
Harry's english is now actually understandable. All the best for the next season. #coys
A 3 mile hike?  Wow. 3 whole miles?
I blame spiderman. Multiverse gone nuts
4:26 "The soccer team?!" pain..
As a Spurs fan I love Harry Kane ❤ 😍 💕 ♥ 💖 💗
Football. Football. Football.
Just so Americans know: Ronaldo, Kane, Messi, Neymar and Maguire are the best football players in the world.
Never thought I would see Harry Kane on the tonight show.
why you gotta make Harry play as the red team, Jimmy 🥲
Really!!?? Harry Kayne in Jimmy Fallon's WOW
Harry ‘I Mean’ Kane.
He could have said spurs a couple times
What !!!
How the hell did kane drop here😂😂😂
I can not believe Harry is on the tonight show🙂
"You have won many awards"
Sorry what is a spurs player doing here acting like a top celebrity. Don’t forget harry to mention Tom Brady - check. Trying to market Tottenham when they are so shit, so shit , will never be like Chelsea, that’s Harry’s only chance of success to join the only team in London, Chelsea FC.
Why would you invite a nonce onto the show? Might as well get prince Andrew on there
Have to turn on the subtitles for Harry #COYS
0:01 Handshake fail. Well played by Kane.
Still Spursy.
the best of England
Wtf didnt expect him to bo on here
Kane 💪 👏
First 25 seconds possibly the cringiest thing i’ve ever witnessed but apart from that, nice interview
to be honest who would pick a harry kane golden card if its not upgarded on ultimate team
Harry MF Kane 👑
the most amusing is watching jimmy trying to understand what harry is saying :D
Kane in Jimmy Fallon 😵‍💫 my heads exploded
“You are my player in Fifa” “You play Fifa?” “ I… eh… I play you”   Come on Jimmy, even Harry knew you were taking the piss
We won the world cup if we were going to win it again!
Wow!!! Really!?? ❤❤❤
He must have a new agent.
The other team was arsenal btw.
Jimmy should of asked him how many trophies he has won.
No way he plays fifa and no way he uses Harry Kane
I felt  like Jimmy was being very courteous almost careful with his questions which was funny cause he's normally not that😂
Why is he on this 😂
Arsenal fans when you play Champions League you're players get on shows like this.
This feels weird
H looking sharp
Come on you Spurs!
What is happing 🤯
How can anyone like Jimmy Falcon. The guy is so fake and forced I wanted to watch this as a football fan from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 but it’s too cringe because of this host
Am I the only person who is looking for G bale on the stage? pretty sure they are on the trip to play golf.
This is so fucking random seeing harry with a bit of showbiz makeup on and a smart jacket talking to jimmy fucking Fallon hahahaha, I love it.
Yeah he’s a bit vanilla, but I personally think that Harry Kane is a great representative of England football (soccer) national team. Modest, hard-working, talented, family-oriented, and classy. Not to mention charitable and no involvement in big scandals. It’s funny because most Americans won’t have a problem comprehending Harry’s speech. Sadly, it’s his fellow countrymen that will oftentimes mock and bring down their national captain for his speech impediment.
Harry Kane the champ?
Random crossover but entertaining. Love Harry man think he's very underrated, would mean the world to him and all of us if he could lead us to the world cup later this year. ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Fallon demonstrating that he's actually never ever played FIFA in his life 😂
Right so..Wait till England v US in this Nov Qatar World Cup
Sorry but I don’t believe that Jimmy Fallon has a clue who Harry Kane is…
This is my Multiverse of Madness
He’s one of our ownnnn!!! HARRY KANE HES ONE OF OWN!!! COYSSSS
'You have won So many thing' 🤣🤣
i’m from the US but i support Tottenham. was cool to see one of our very own in Harry Kane being on Jimmy Fallon! it’s my dream to go to Spurs game w my best friend one day. WE HAVE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE football next year!!! COYS!!!
zero trophies.
How many trophies harry lol?
HES ONE OF OUR OWN, HES ONE OF OUR OWWWWWWN, HARRY KANE, HES OWN OF OUR OWN!!!! COME ON YOU SPURS
wow harry kane fixed his accent
Damnnnnn
coys!!
He's one of our own!
This is the weirdest crossover we've ever seen
Harry is not made for shows like this! Next time pick Declan Rice or Jack Grealish. Harry is a bit shy
Kane really doing anything to try and get a trophy. Even willing to play against Jimmy Fallon on a miniature table.
Why is this soo random 😂😂
Never seen Harry looking so dapper and speaking so clearly.
Did he said “harry kane, the champ”? Such a shame that harry kane hasn’t got any trophies 🏆 yet. But that spurs issues @@ hope he can win at least one big trophy before retiring
Legend
subtitles came in clutch
bruh why is Harry Kane here lol this is so unexpected
Yes Harry! What a bloke.
COYS!
So random that Kane is on the show, thought it was a joke. Multiverse confirmed lol
Playing in red uniforms, Harry should have lost on purpose! COYS!!
Hasn’t got any trophies 🏆
As a Spurs fan from London, this is one of the most surreal things I've ever seen
Had to turn on to the subtitles for this one
think harry kanes overrated tbh. nice guy, but in terms of his football, overrated
Why is he here though. Nothing to promote.
What you doing there harry
Which language is he speaking?
Why tf would they put Harry Kane on the show for 2 minutes. Is he the official ambassador for the World Cup because they need viewers after the protests of Qatar?
Why are poeple showcked that the England captain is on a talk show? A few goals away from being our greatest ever goal scorer, and his 28.
Up the Spurs
“You’ve won countless..awards” I cringed at that 😂
LMAO WTF  NEVER SAW THIS COMING  THIS IS SO RANDOM LMAO 😂 But I loved it.  #hesoneofourown #coys
They cut the bit where Fallon asks Harry why Dier wasn't included in the England squad
“ You have got count of awards “ if they only  knew 🤔
Go On Harry 👏🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
So random...
😁😁
to all American's watching this if you can't understand what his saying us in the U.K. don't understand him as well he is really good with his feet but not so much when he talks 😂
Next time bring Sonny
one of our own! COYS
왜 이 얼굴이 더 이상하지
no way he was on the tonight show, i mean its not new for footballers to be on the tonight show, BUT KANE, that is honestly amazing
He's won countless rewards... "No trophies"... is he talking with cotton wool in his mouth
Harry Kane will forever be the consummate professional and perfect role model for young football players.
Jimmy never mentioned the TROPHIES harry won :)
Haha love it
Harry was so cool on here as if it was normal when it clearly blow the majority minds.
My Striker🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Im American but i think Kane’s awesome so seeing him with jimmy fallon is insane in a great way lol
guess he’s only two goals away now
How tf he is here
#COYS
He’s one of our own he’s one of our own
COME ON YOU SPURSSS. HE'S ONE OF OUR OWN   BEST CF ITW
What a player this man is!!
COYS
Spurs fan since 1983. Giants fan since 1981. 🥰

Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon...what kind of multiverse of madness is this?!
Harry Kane must have one hell of an agent 😂

LMAO PROUD OF U HARRY
Won countless award maybe but ZERO trophies and that won't change any time soon at spurs 😉

Harry Kane trynna speak good English! I think he practiced speakin more than his penalty kicks for this show 😂
방탄소년단 보느라 챙겨보던 여기서 쏘니 친구 케인을 봐서 반갑구만 ㅋㅋ
COYS
COYS!
The 🐐
Come on you Spurs!!!  I had no idea behind why he liked the Patriots and Tom Brady until this interview! Liking the Patriots for his reason is forgivable...
Great player. Even though I don’t watch.
One just never knows what the show shall bring.😁
What’s kane doing in late night show, for all of the football players he’s the least expected player on late show.
COYS!!
HE'S ONE OF OUR OWN, HE'S ONE OF OUR OWN, HARRY KANE, HE'S ONE OF OUR OWNNNN
he's one of our own! he's one of our own! harry kane! he's one of our own!
What a legend, as us Spurs fan like to say, “he’s one of our own”. COYS!!!
We need Son on Jimmy Kimmel now
Don’t like to see my boy Harry on this man’s show. Looks like he’s being indoctrinated into the globalist shill show.
COYS
100% legend
Harry, don’t sell out to the peek-a-boo club!
harrykane we love you #COYS
COYS
Who invited my guy blud? 🤣🤣🤣
Never in my mind did i beleive kane on Jimmy Fallon in States I thought it's Ryan Reynolds looking at the pictures ..
저기서 뭐하노 게이야...
Never red, Harry! COYS
Ryan Gosling?
You are my fifa player when I play video games 😭
Never understood the whole "speech impediment" thing, I'm from a non-English speaking country and only learned English through school. Yet, I can 100% understand what he's saying. Seems like most Americans can too!
did I see this just now?!?!
This was so random more like Dr strange opening portal to Demon Slayer
He’s one of our own! Go on harry
Omg. He didn't say "obviously" in this interview. Hahahaha
It's Gotta Be KANE!!!
As a tottenham fan I got really excited when Harry was called "the Champ" at the end. Then I got sad.
He is one of our own
Goooo Harry!!! Such an inspiration to us all! COYS
come on you spurs :)
WTF is Kane doing on this show!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️ At least get someone who's won a trophy this season 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry on Jimmy Fallon. Awesome!
I'm still amazed that Kane is on the talk show😅
Spurs has never won anything, so sad, altough they have Kane and Son
Man like H!!!! Love this man #COYS
Harry Kane | Welcome to Tonight Show FC | Goals, Assists, Skills, Dribble | 2022

Next Guest : Harry Maguire
Harry Kane to MLS. Here we go!!
I love this! Harry gets the attention he deserves!
HK , MY 🐐
Random to see Harry Kane on Jimmy fallon 😂
COYS
This felt so surreal seeing Harry Kane on Jimmy Fallon. I see Harry Kane almost weekly here in the UK and watched a lot of Jimmy Fallon over the years but seeing the two together felt very strange indeed.
Jesus Christ what a boring person….Kane needs interview training…he is so one dimensional and dull with his conversation.
omg harry freaking legend kane
Jimmy acts like he watches football 😂😂
The most random shit I watched today lol
Silence in the crowds really shows that they didn't understand a single word from him and they didn't even care about football. The real football
The reason I like Harry Kane is because he doesn’t give up, puts in hard work day in and day out, even with all his talents and skills he’s one of the greatest striker.
COYS
WHATTTTT WHAT is he  DOING HERE OMG WHAT A SUPRISE WOW. ID NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT this
COYS
Legend! Harry Kane he's one of our own!
Best player in the best team in the world. COYS.
American be like: Who the fock is this guy and what english accent even is that and what was he talking about. I don't understand a single focking word
ITS HARRY KANE SCHOOLS  LEYS GOOOOO
Harry Kane he’s one of our own, COYS
I think he's well known in America coz he's a Spurs player and Tottenham are very close to NFL coz they new stadium can build an NFL pitch. Plus, Harry Kane loves NFL.
Unbelievable ✌️
Kind of harry Kane
Harry Kane you are the best💙
Cristiano Ronaldo could never! Literally.
Get Son
Ryan Gosling was busy, so they asked Harry Kane to be on the show
He’s one of our own, He’s one of our own, Harry Kane he’s one of our own!!! COYS!!!
Legend❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Oh my Kane!! Good to see you there!💙
#COYS
My man!!!
LEGEND
Spurs through n' through, but this is so random lol! Great to see you Harry!
Best player in the prem
So obvious that Jimmy is not a football fan.
😍😍😍💙💙💙
COYS!
Jimmy call Son for an interview. He deserves it and also Mo Salah.
Next Season league 30 goal.
Okay so we're all confused as to why this man is on here. Good to know.
How’s this happened then!?
Even Harry looked a bit confused when Jimmy said "won countless awards" 😂
would have scored more with sonny 🤣🤣
“Harry Kane The Champ” 😂
COYS🤍🤍
It's Hurricane 🔥🔥
Go Harry! #COYS
Yeah!! Harry 🤍 COYS🤍
He's one of our own ...
For ppl how don't follow premier league, Kane plays for a club called Tottenham Hotspur, he is a very good player but they NEVER win anything.  They've a word for it - spursy. He is a serial diver. And once his teammate eriksen scored a goal but Kane swore he score it not eriksen. Everyone knew that was a lie. Not a fan.
해리케인 보려고 왔습니다 🔥🔥🔥 코이즈🤍
For those saying their surprised jimmy can understand him , Jimmy has a ear piece and Harrys words are being translated live , watch out for  the pause before Jimmy responses  .
COYS
Such a random booking. 1. Why is Harry Kane the face of the epl on nbc? 2. Why does Jimmy keep mentioning england and the world cup when fox has the tv rights??
