Hey I'm new to 3d printing and I got a Creality Ender 3 V2 and it works well with Printing the problem is when I try to Print something I created or something off of thingverse or Tinkercad the only thing I can print is the rabbit or the boat but for anything else It doesn't Print Even Though it Shows on the printer Screen It doesn't print but the printing time Moves but no movement from the printer i tried countless times and I was wondering if anyone knows the problem here if so please explain to me have a great day god bless
Your accent makes this perfect
1,500th
Such fans do not create enough pressure to compress air into smaller holes.  You've probably already noticed that it's practically ineffective.
Gud
Damm thats some fine art needs to be in a museum
Huina tvoi printer
bro made a cpu dildo 😭💀
Printer: This is what you get when you never let me EXPRESS MYSELF!
I feel like This guy is like a safer 3d printing version electroboom
that thing doesnt looks like kenny? The thing before the glass wall?
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
I love your mood about a fail print. I don’t necessarily share your good nature about it, but you give me hope that I can be as ok with it as you are someday!
🤣🤣
This guy always makes me laugh
I was picturing a bit differently lol, it happens.
Thing in the background looks like Kenny from South Park
I love watching your videos, always so amusing
Lol I feel you
Hey buddy, I’m picking up the sarcasm. You’re laying it on PRETTY THICK 😂
My printer became an artist this morning while working on a 3 day print 🥲
I have a poder bank which will give me about 2 hours of electricity for my printers, I rarely run them at the same time but if I do I have 2 hours to finish the prints if not they will Be lost
https://youtube.com/shorts/pyQWiAUK_-M?feature=share
This hurts to watch
How's the performance of the duct tho
funny
Hi I have the ender 3 V2 and when I print high prints it likes isn't Correctly  do you know how I can solve that
So where are fanducts used these days? That looks like a pc fan and i heard pcs stopped using narrow airways because the open airflow was better for cooling. Definitely explains why my old laptops used to overheat with that low airflow
This is some ai art stuff.
Ooohs special touch got me 😂
I love how chill he is about this, he ain’t mad
Gorgeous ooort
It's definitely a pink SOMETHING
I mean, I'll be real with you... That literally looks like it was designed on purpose. Art piece, fidget toy, torture test, and would actually do well at all three 😊
Did you use the "resume print" function?
How did you get your industrial gig? How much do they pay you?
At this point I would not be surprised if most of this man’s house was mostly made out of 3d printer shit
I get a window with a glass He must get a window with a glass I get a 3D printer, he cannot afford.  Great success!
Your videos are the reason the Internet exists
That sort of setback would drive me NUTS
It has a mind is it’s own
I love this guy's voice and accent😭
Wonderful attention to details 😅
What is grass? Grass is a common name for a large group of plants that belong to the family Poaceae, which includes about 10,000 species of flowering plants1 Grasses are found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the polar regions to the tropics, and from the mountains to the deserts. Grasses are also very important for human civilization, as they provide food, fodder, fuel, fiber, medicine and many other products and services.  Characteristics of grasses Grasses have some distinctive features that make them different from other plants. Some of these features are:  Stems: Grasses have hollow stems that are divided into segments by nodes. The nodes are where the leaves attach to the stem. The stem segments between the nodes are called internodes. Some grasses have solid stems, such as bamboo and sugarcane2 Leaves: Grasses have long and narrow leaves that grow from the base of the stem or from the nodes. The leaves have parallel veins that run along the length of the leaf. The leaves are usually arranged in two rows on opposite sides of the stem. The part of the leaf that wraps around the stem is called the sheath, and the part that extends away from the stem is called the blade. The point where the sheath and blade meet is called the ligule, which can be a thin membrane, a fringe of hairs or absent2 Roots: Grasses have fibrous root systems that branch extensively and form a dense network of fine roots near the soil surface. The roots help to anchor the plant, absorb water and nutrients, and prevent soil erosion. Some grasses also have rhizomes or stolons, which are horizontal stems that grow underground or along the soil surface and produce new shoots and roots at their nodes. Rhizomes and stolons help grasses to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas2 Flowers: Grasses have small and inconspicuous flowers that are grouped together in spikelets. A spikelet consists of one or more florets, which are the individual flowers, and two bracts called glumes, which enclose the florets. Each floret has a lemma and a palea, which are two more bracts that surround the reproductive organs. The reproductive organs consist of three stamens (male parts) and a pistil (female part) with two feathery stigmas. The stamens produce pollen grains that are carried by wind to the stigmas of other florets for fertilization. The pistil develops into a seed called a caryopsis, which is enclosed by the lemma and palea2 The following table summarizes some of the main characteristics of grasses:  Characteristic	Description Stems	Hollow, segmented by nodes Leaves	Long, narrow, parallel-veined Roots	Fibrous, branching Flowers	Small, grouped in spikelets Types of grasses Grasses can be classified into different types based on their growth habit, life cycle, morphology or use. Some of these types are:  Bunchgrasses: These are grasses that grow in tufts or clumps without rhizomes or stolons. They usually have erect stems and leaves that radiate from a central point. Examples of bunchgrasses are wheat, oats, barley and rye. Sod-forming grasses: These are grasses that form dense mats or carpets of vegetation with rhizomes or stolons. They usually have creeping stems and leaves that lie flat on the ground or curve upwards at the tips. Examples of sod-forming grasses are bluegrass, bermudagrass and zoysiagrass. Annual grasses: These are grasses that complete their life cycle in one year or less. They germinate from seeds, grow vegetatively, produce flowers and seeds, and die within a single growing season. Examples of annual grasses are crabgrass, foxtail and barnyardgrass. Perennial grasses: These are grasses that live for more than one year. They can survive unfavorable conditions such as drought, frost or fire by going dormant or losing their aboveground parts. They can regrow from their roots, rhizomes or stolons when conditions improve. Examples of perennial grasses are switchgrass, big bluestem and bamboo. Cereal grasses: These are grasses that produce edible grains that are rich in carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins. They are cultivated as staple crops for human consumption and animal feed. Examples of cereal grasses are rice, corn, wheat and millet. Forage grasses: These are grasses that provide fodder for grazing animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. They are grown as pastures, hay or silage. Examples of forage grasses are alfalfa, clover and fescue. Turf grasses: These are grasses that are grown as ornamental or recreational plants for lawns, parks, golf courses and sports fields. They are selected for their appearance, durability and low maintenance. Examples of turf grasses are Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass and bentgrass. Bamboos: These are grasses that have woody stems that can grow very tall and thick. They are used for construction, furniture, paper, musical instruments and many other purposes. Examples of bamboos are giant bamboo, golden bamboo and lucky bamboo. Benefits of grasses Grasses have many benefits for humans and the environment. Some of these benefits are:  Food: Grasses provide food for humans and animals in the form of grains, shoots, rhizomes and leaves. Grasses are the source of most of the world’s calories and proteins. Grasses also produce sugar, oil, starch, alcohol and other products that are used for food or industrial purposes. Fiber: Grasses provide fiber for making paper, cloth, rope, baskets and other items. Grasses such as cotton, hemp and flax are grown as fiber crops. Grasses such as bamboo, rattan and reed are used for making furniture, mats and other items. Fuel: Grasses provide fuel for heating, cooking and lighting. Grasses such as wood, charcoal and peat are burned directly as fuel. Grasses such as corn, sugarcane and switchgrass are converted into ethanol or biodiesel that can be used as fuel for vehicles or generators. Medicine: Grasses provide medicine for treating various diseases and ailments. Grasses such as wheatgrass, barley grass and oat straw are used as herbal remedies or dietary supplements. Grasses such as lemongrass, citronella and vetiver are used as essential oils or aromatherapy. Soil conservation: Grasses help to conserve soil by preventing erosion, improving soil structure, increasing organic matter and enhancing water infiltration. Grasses also help to reduce soil salinity, acidity and toxicity by absorbing excess salts, metals and chemicals from the soil. Water conservation: Grasses help to conserve water by reducing runoff, evaporation and transpiration. Grasses also help to purify water by filtering sediments, nutrients and pollutants from the water. Climate regulation: Grasses help to regulate climate by moderating temperature, humidity and wind. Grasses also help to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass or soil. Biodiversity: Grasses help to maintain biodiversity by providing habitat, food and shelter for many animals, insects and microorganisms. Grasslands support a rich diversity of life forms such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, bees and fungi. Conclusion Grass is a type of plant that belongs to the family Poaceae. It has distinctive features such as hollow stems, narrow leaves, fibrous roots and small flowers grouped in spikelets. There are many types of grasses based on their growth habit, life cycle, morphology or use. Grasses have many benefits for humans and the environment such as food, fiber, fuel, medicine, soil conservation, water conservation, climate regulation and biodiversity.
Please printout one Pokemon 🥺☺️

Your 3D printer is tired of your bullshit
Big Gru energy in this one.
Storm = no power? Wtf?
what is the material used on the bed, to prevent sticking to the bed?
Weakest storm ever
Hahaha, I really laughed at that! Haha. Nice! :P -I think this is now one of my favorite YT Shorts

The artist formerly known as 3d printer
I wanna 3d print a car
It looks like a bad dragon
can't wait to see a AI 3D Printer
So don't be afraid from AI... 😘
Something always happens to you! I'm glad you look on the bright side!
I have a sv06 printer and I have had 2 other printers in the past and I haven't had this problem yet. What causes this problem? Just curious.
Is that kenny?
Когдаон начал говорить я услышал прынг прыг прыг
I love your attitude towards it
I saw the whole video years ago and struggled to find it, but then re-thought of this again and googled "3d printer is an artist" and bam! Thank god for your short.
😂😂😂...I wish I was this kind to myself and my printers when prints fail
Printer: wanna see some real speed b*****
Its stunning, remarkable, beautiful, i must have it, ill give you 8 million dollars.
That would be printer fail
You must show recycling
You sir, know how to make lemonade from lemons.
These shorts are gorgeous art themselves.
I like your brain
It’s fan art…    I’ll see myself out.
So funny
Ostatnia rasa jakims cudem powraca z marłych tylko nazwe zmieniła na policja
I take it crash detection is off 😂
😂
😅😅😅😅😅
Mine too... Turns out my turtle was splashing water on my controller haja
I’m planning on getting a 3D printer, and I’m definitely going to use “my printer is an artist” whenever things will go wrong in the future😂😂😂
How did you manage to fix that
Sent it to me if you dont need it
Looks like a bird
Should reduce the extruder cluster weight and print faster so you can print at lower layer
You know I am something of an artist myself      -- probably the printer
That was harrowingly funny. Loved it
Print heat waves
My printer only prints art he is a great rat nest maker lol
Who doesnt like a great hour print just to kill a fan
До последнего ждал пока он напечатает брак, а не остановил...
ooooh special touch hahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mane who gave gru a 3D printer?
I have done one key chain using this
U could just continued the print
Uuuu, special touch
Had a misprint after 10 hours because the power died...  Tip for you:  Start up your printer Remove the printbed (mine is a glass panel fixed onto the heatbed with four clips) Home the printer Put on the print Manually touch up the Print in the Z-Axis and write down the Z Value (go with the extruder above the print, and slowly decrease until it is "touching" the print) Manually edit the G-Code and remove everything before that Z-Axis Value (but don't remove the M commands, and let it home the printer). After the homing it should G0 (rapid speed movement) in Z above the print   Remove failed Print Start up program and home the extruder Pause it after it went up in Z Put on print Unpause Program  If it stood longer than 5-10 minutes, a preheat with a hot-air blower (or hair blower) is necessary to get a good bonding.   It won't be perfectly, but I had to do it twice and it worked out pretty well.  EDIT: If the print is small enough that it still can home the printer without the print beeing in the way, you can of course ignore the step. It can also work with homing the axis one by one, and moving the other ones out of the way (be creative 😜). That worked for me, because if you remove the print you need to position it perfectly again.
Start the bidding at £20,000. 🧐
Whats the background music??
Bro that aint a storm its just normal rain
"I'm printing something pink" *Buffers* Me: well no shit *Video resumes*

I *really*think he should go with the first one! It’s sooo good, and you’re right, your printer is the best artist in the world.
I want that Printer xD
Идеальная, четко выверенная аэродинамика и направление воздушных потоков, при помощи специальных ребер. В конце видео, автор в порыве блаженства даже подкинул своё творение. PS ни когда не говорите "что за дрянь получилась", говорите "надо же, как необычно вышло"
-looks at 3D printer art- DADDDDD YOU GOT SOME WORK TO DO
“Ooh special touch” had me dying not gonna lie 🤣
Yeah this is genuinely how I think of art

How the hell did you get a Prusa to mess up like that? 🤣
Why does he kind of sound like Gru
I thought kenny was in the background
You have a really charming voice and sense of humor! I believe this is the first video of yours I was shown while browsing shorts a few months ago, and it made me subscribe for more of that kind of content. Cheers!

“It could have been a boring fan duct instead it’s GoUrGuoS aRt“
Pink :D
We need to open a Museum specifically for AI, Robot and CNC artists
Really hate that about the prusa, no way to resume from power loss
i would print the rest of the first print and then glue them.
I love it when I go for a walk and come back to see my 3D printer doing random stuff.
Don’t use them guys you could get cancer
Your printer : subscribe for more art.  The coding software : am I a joke to you?
Artistic or autistic? Who knows 🤷‍♂️
Wait 1hour for all that??? How do you print so fast

Sus
No Power? That's why I always have back up.

What fans are they
That fan duct will not work. I tried similar thing and only a light breeze came out of the other end. Unless you add another tube in front of it.
I have a problem with my printer, what do I do for it?
Hi

When your printer went to art school instead of engineering.
Stop giving coffee to your intellectual printer, it gives it shaky clammy hands

I can’t be the only one who thinks that he sounds a bit like Dr.Doofenshmirtz
LoL
AI artist, mine usually likes to do spider webs and spools
I love it when he says "cuz there's a storm"
Gorgeous aaret
Probably the artists version would have worked better, he probably have put many thoughts into it.  Did you even try?  Did you even consider he had thought through something about the airflow, a simple human didn't even consider with it's limited mind?  Something that a computer considering Quantum Physics does?
Very pink 👍
When you're a fan of art
Too easy
This is the cutest today 😊
My printed is an Artist too
🤣
Cool
GPU cooler
If you live on the UK the storm is called "Storm Arwen"
https://youtube.com/channel/UCabNmJXRBHPIquvfWEV1cNg

You sound like the scientist who creates machine and add nator at the end
This is actually great.... this printer needs googly eyes so it can see its own abstract creation
How tf you get it print so smooth
I thought only my printer does this. If an expert like you face this issue, I’m not as devastated as earlier.
*”GeoRGuS ART!” “Becaose THarS A StaORm!”*  But on a serious note, good vid bro!
Precioso
Haha I love it lol

The fact that you threw that brilliant piece of work aside like trash made me gasp
That's the printer we need. Not these shitty 2D printers, which just get clogged boringly
I was all, wait, he wanted a pink traffic cone?
i-  y'all-  i thought it was a pink traffic cone...
“Oooo special touch” 😂
Your voice reminds me of Doofenshmirtz from Phineas & Ferb
I... I actually like it
Négatif 🚫🚫🚫😂
That moment when the storm is aproaching
Cool
What do u use to make ur designs cuz I have a WiFi box and it tells me I need a 2.4 mgh WiFi
I remember that one of the printers I assembled (Anycubic 4MAX if I remember it correctly) had a faulty Y axis driver, so anything that printed out was warped randomly in the Y direction. I call the test owls that came out of that machine Wonky Junior. I still have that driver! 😁
✨ _oooh special touch_ ✨
Why does this guy sound like the villain in Luca
Reminds me of gru from despicable me😆
wow wow wow wow.. where you from again? i could swear you sound like my new dm xD
XD
I don't know why but I thought it's a whistle
Polish 3d printer 😂
ooOoo special touch!
fan duct for what though
Ah I see your printer got a useless degree! How fun.
I'm fascinated, this should be in the museum
It made a joystick
It looks like an abomination of a parrot that was never fully born standing on a hat
Gru?
"Ooh! Special touch!" 3D printer: *crunch* *crunch*
This delights me
Sell it on the internet as art, someone will buy it lol
The sarcasm in his voice just makes it 10 times better.
...OHHH it's a FAN DUCT... I thought... never mind.
The “Gorgeous art” sounded like Gru from despicable me
it’s not just pink it’s f***ing pink
Get a ups on them printers
of all the shorts I've seen, this is by far the best! here, you dropped this - >👑
I can relate to the printer lol, just working away lost in thought and then you look and realize you messed it all up.
I want to print a fidget spinner
That could pass as a modern art
Passive/Aggressively taking down your printer. The true mark of an engineer.
I like his enthusiasm.
Welp its grown a mind of its own  Time to kill it
Is it just me or does he kinda sound like gru
I'd actually like to see more videos like this .
So Wholesome
AYO WHY THIS DUDE KINDA SOUND LIKE DR DOOFENSHMIRTZ???
Your voice is cute
I keep coming back to this video. It’s perfect.
What's the use of a fan duct?
I very much appreciate getting to see what it was meant to be very  satisfying
"Very pink"  Lmao 🤣
I love it when 3d printers dont  print properly cause you either end up with a soaghetti mess of wasted filament or a wonderful mistake that cant be replicated (example a thing my dad printed for work turned into what looked like part if a heart )
The accent just makes this
I died when he said "ooo special touuchh ;)"
You should've auctioned it to an art museum and make millions out of it
the struggle!!! I feel you dude!!!
It's always nice when people can laugh and view things like this with optimism and accept that mistakes happen instead of flipping a table over everything that goes wrong. He even called it art haha
Wish I had that
Your accent made me think you said fanta not fan duct. I was so confused
Modern art in a nutshell:
Im pinking something pink
You have to let it do its own thing, find it's own style
Love that accent 👌😌
You call that a storm?
I love how chill he is about it. 😂
sounds a little like dr. doofenshmirtz
Totally thought fake penis
Not trying to be mean but that reminds me of female's pissing cup/cone
I genuinely think it was the Otto's voice actor from that Barbie movie LOL
Mihai: 👁️👄👁️ what is this??? 3d printer: it's ART. But of course you HuMAnS wouldn't get it 🙄
Why it's so expensive for a machine that makes plastic junk
the first machine that actually created art
: )
I thought you were printing VLC™ media player symbol
Ok cool but what is it?
Hahaha love this!!!
This guy sounds like the bully from LUCA lmao
I hope the 3D printer has a successful career in art sometime in the future
30s later and I'm subbed, this dude got character
Great value mars gizmo
oh and it only took 8 minutes
Great fan-art
I love this guy i can't
Wut is that
AND IT TOOK ONLY 3 ATTEMPTS
Sound like ghost busters printing
Por favor dígame en donde consigo esa máquina
Landfill material
The first sign of a machine having free will, and everyone's ignoring it!
The comments here are golden but just out of curiosity, what was he trying to print?
3d printer be like  You get no fan you get SPAGHETTI
I’m happy that you’re supportive of your 3D printer’s art ☺️ Even technical equipment needs to have fun every now and again
Gorgeous gorgeous at the end made me laugh
“oooOOoo! Special touch!☺️”  Cracked me up!🤣
This guys narration is the best
This is very cool
I like his voice!
One day machines will have a mind of their own
I have no idea who you are but OMG I love your accent 🤣🤣🤣 GRU from Despicable Me
Love how casual it iss
With the my printer is an artist I would totally keep it like that as a trophy or something
That’s so pretty
Poor guy lol glad you were able to get it to work in the end
The “uuu special touch” made me cackle. Why is the robot touchibng it like that 😭
Someone get your printer and easel and a paint brush!
Pare rau de Furtuna :)))
“GÖRGEUS aRt” that made me cackle i love this video
“YOU WON’T STIFFLE MY CREATIVITY”
🤣🤣🤣 I love your commentary.
Hahaahha
When you called it an artist so nonchalantly I felt that
"oooOOoo, special touch!" 🤣   Amazing
Dr. Kootrapali, is that you?
Oh! How did you fix that issue?
Why would you throw it away. It might start a world war
My printer is an artist *chucks it* let’s make the fan duct
the printer made a æовл-'#&@₽эал
The best artist ever!
"Ooo special touch!" while it's malfunctioning and destroying itself 🤣
Epik
Bruh the commentator tho-
"Special touch"
What 3d printer do you recommend for first time users
Next time keep it. Maybe your 3D printer will do another one better than the last.
Printer: "I made you something! I worked real hard on it, do you like it? C:" Guy: "sure buddy."
No effence bit he sounds like Dr doofishmurg
To be honest, that misprint genuinely looks like something that could be in a modern art museum
Top ten Millionare Modern Artists.
1:30
Oh dear
I hate your voice
I love how he compliments the printer
When he said its gorgeous art that made me smile
Why pink of all colors
He sounds like the flamingo from gnomeo and juliet
No power... CUZ DERS A STOOORRM
Your voice reminds me of the scientist on Phineas and Ferb
The “OooOO special touch 🙃” gets me
https://youtube.com/channel/UCEsEmtDvrZW17HFG3SOSYrQ
This 3D printer has more personality than I do
the printer decided to make a bird-
About storms and power fun fact this happened last night I was using the rest room at 11:35 when the power went out and then my alarm went of the dogs started barking and there i was..On the toilet with no light.
Sell it to a modern art museum and bam 100 mil
Omg this is so funny i cant believe how funny this was to me..
I thought it was a fedora
"Uuuu special touch"  Artist's father
🤣🤣🤣
I would turn it into a funky lamp... I turn everything into a lamp... oh god am I glad I don't own a 3D printer, I wouldn't be able to stop building weird crap.
It’s the Flamingo from Gnomeo and Juliet trying to Print himself a Wife
he sounds so proud of his printer
Didn't know Gru had a YouTube channel 👌
I’m colorblind thank you for telling me 🙏🙏🙏
Youre a brave man watching it fail
I'm going to call my printer an artist
The "oOOoO Special touch" really got me XD
Sit on it
He sounds like doofenshimert from Phineas and Ferb but just talking very softly
Why was this so funny lmao
U are a comedic genius i love this!!
Cue the task failed successfully meme
from where is he from??
Não entendi nada
.. why does he sound a bit like dr. doofenschmirtz?
Modern art in a nutshell
He sounds like Dr. Doofenshmirtz but more chill
Omg I love your voice!
Pink! :)
Ah yes misprints are fabulous.
Please you're so funny without trying 💀💀
Hahaaaa
that "oo special touch" combined with the cracking and wobbling of the material while the printer is just STRUGGLING is the funniest thing I've seen today. represents my life perfectly.
I kinda like that
Why does he sounds like doofenshmirtz
The sarcasm in that “but my printer is an artist” is gold 🤣
You do any resin printing?
ou sound like that guy from phineas and pherb lmaooo
"I was... picturing it a bit differently but my printers an artist :)"
Is it just me or does he sound like Dr. Doofenshmirtz
“Ooo special touch :0” I love how he said this😂
Add eyes to the printer pls
Can you say “ah Perry the platypus.”
"task failed sucsesfully
this mans voice is so satisfying and i dont know why
Lol
Can I buy the fail
This is so funny for no reason
You're funny!
Ooooohhh special touch the whole thing begins to crumble
That Kenny in the background scared the shit out of me
Ooh! An artist. 😳
*MISSION FAILED SUCCESSFULLY*
This is so wholesome in an incredibly indescribable way
Lol, you're cute
I loved the fact that while you were obviously not the happiest with the fail, it wasn’t like completely anger or rage over the waste of time and material like most would.
I love this XD
I love the little "Guz dere'z a zdorm!!"
Artist? More like 3d artist
'one day a storm came by and said "you die!" to my power, oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooooo oh'
What language is this
Ur printer is very talented. 😌
He sounds like that scientist villain from Phineas and Ferb
Paint a crib for a dog or a cage for a cat :D
Female version of the sorting hat from Harry Potter
Why does he sound like Gru from Minions.
I don't wanna sound rude but- he sounds like gru and I love it
Anyone else think he sounds like grew
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day🤣🤣🤣
I didnt know 3D printers could become deviant.
Lol I thought it was a pink frog standing on a platform XD
The pain is real
That kinda reminds me of the stage 1 and 6 album covers for everywhere at the end of time, nice
True... Ur printer is an artist 😄😆
I love this guys accent it makes the video so much better
*when the 3-d printer is sick of listening to humans and wants to do it’s own thing:*
Luigi?
Dude seems happy lol
I think his printer just had a stroke in the beginning...
Pink is a manly color
"Cause there's a storm!"  *Two raindrops*
Ouh special touch !
I love apoo of the simpsons now selling  artworks 😂😂😂
😆
Nothing can express how happy.this makes me. I'm not entirely sure why it makes me so happy, but is certainly does.
Its a owl its a hat its a mess
This mans just screams happy energy
you sir, have just gained a subscriber for this wholesome content.
Very wholesome, thank you
ㅋㅋㅋ
“I’m printing something pink!”   This is so cute. 🥰
What did I even just watch lol
Yeah I had one before those settings have to be precise I guess
Gru is that you
I love this!! Keep doing what you love!!
Is this Dr. Doofenshmirtz
This happened with the 3d printers at my school all the time ... We had a competition to see who's was more deformed rather that to see who's looked  project the most....... lol.
I love your sarcasm!
I wouldve used the first one
OH NO THE STORM
"Abstract"
I love 3d printers They're actually so cool Basically Lego but even cooler
This short had more relatable moments than most Youtubers in their entire channel, and I don't even own a 3d printer!
The way he says "ooOooOoOoOO special touch" gets me every time
Love it when it happens
Yoooooooo
Gugu
He didnt get enought sleep
Artist
He sounds like Dangerously Funny mixed with Gru. I love him
"Ooh. A special touch...." I totally lost it. This guy is hilarious.
I adore this video.
I’m waiting to see someone who owns a 3D printer make something useful
Ann I the only one or is it when he said “gorgeous art” he sounded like gru
why does he kind of sound like dr. doofenshmirtz
This is amazing
Your Italian accent is VERY STRONG
This might seem random, but I wish that YouTube still showed the number of dislikes on a comment.
Maybe a modern artist XD
Oh my God I felt this in my soul
Greu cu vremea…🤣🤣
His accent is so cute and he has a lovely voice and that printer is a lovely artist
I thought that was what he originally intended to print but only slightly different BUT then he threw it away and I was shook. The fan duct makes sooo much more sense
‘Machine starts to break the mold’ man in the back “oh a special touch” 😂😂
Cause there's a ✨⚡St0Rm⚡✨
He sounded like gru when he said “ther is a storm”
Wow
Dr. Doofenshmirtz?
It is a gimbaled fan duct now!
Printer: god what am I doing this looks like shit Him: THIS IS ART!!!
Ohh special touch
Gru? Is that you?
Go home printer. you're drunk
his printer is an _"ARTIST"_ **in quotation mark**
Just get a server ups they only cost like 4k and they last like 9 hours with a printer
LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
nice
your trash is gonna end up in the ocean stop wasting with this nonsense
Why your sound is weird
"I was picturing it differently, but my printers an artist"  "I was hoping it could be smarter, but my womb is messed up and it got none of my genes"  yes I have to make everything depressing shut up
when it started crunching 💀
He sounds like Gru
Is no one pointing out he sounds like Dr Doofenshmirtz?
Dr. Doofenshmirtz is that you?
I love his voice
This guy sounds like Gru and I love it so much
Very funny dude☺😂
Moses? Is that you?
sounds just like the evil weasel scientist from Conker’s Bad Fur Day
There’s a power supply unit for this so your prints can finish during a storm
I like how you just let it keep going. Printer you doing amazing!
All fun in games when the plastic starts melting over time because of the heat
The sorting hat
How much was it
ThIs IsN’t ArT  Then tell me how a line is any better, literally a line
I like how instead of rage or frustration from the lost time, resources, and failure, they made something fun and cute out of the situation and kept calm. Honestly a great work of art from your printer <3
Your voice tho, for a moment i thought you where mario from that old video game
"special touch" 🤣 Yeah, I have to keep reminding mine to stick to the script. I have an 'art' collection of my own.
Dr. Doofensmirtz..?
Does the beginning but remind anyone else of Detroit: become human?
😂
Wait is that a pc fan ???
"Ooo, special touch!"
“Oooh special touch.” 😂
667 comments
Haha I made the comment section have 667 comments
🤣🤣🤣🤣too good at it...
Lmfao
Magnificent!
I thought it was meant to be a penguin
He sounds like Gru from dispicable me
I don’t know why but that’s adorable. “My printer is an artist” you sound like a proud parent
OOooo special touch 😂😂😂
The printer had a lil breakdown real quick
Hahaha exactly this happened to me two weeks ago with a luke's x-wing model xd
le art
Everyone with a 3d printer has had this happen atleast once. I know from experience
I like. Very pink
No im crying this was so wholesomely funny ☠️
people keep thinking 3d printers are the future. Now you can have paper jams with an extra dimension added
You sound like ercole from luca ngl lol
Has beautiful noctua fan, adds pink duct...
Special touch 😂🤣
Very pink👍
Is this guy and Gru from Despicable Me from the same place? The accent is just so simple..
What would happen if you put your finger in as its printing
“Oooo special touch” was the best
I want to shove that up my ass.
My guy sounds like dr. Dofenshmirtz 😂
I cackled when I finally realized it was supposed to be a fanduct
This man agayn 🤣🤣 Btw love your vids😊
*Oh no*  The machines have learned abstract art. We're DOOMED!
Hmmm, beautiful.
But my printer is a artist 💀😂😂😂😂
:o
"Oooh special touch" 🤣
Is it just me or does his accent kinda sound like mogi's?
the idea that the printer is making art makes me less frustrated when things go wrong. like oops sorry man didn’t know you wanted to pop out some sculpture practice today, lmk when you’re done
At first i thought it was a cgi video
He sounds so calm and pissed at the same time 🙃
Lol that 3D printer just seemed angry 😂  Like, "I'm done with your fuckin shit joe, I'm not making your slave art ANYMORE"
Printer: "Yeah it's a neat design but here's how I would do it"
Don't let robots do art, then they will want equal rights
very pink
Your personality is wonderful 😂
"Artistic license" as they say. Haha
I had a pc that would do this with larger file transfers... Anything over 4gb. 3.9gb fine. 4.01gb better hope you made a copy...
He sounds like strongbad
Can u 3d print a horse?
hows phineas and ferb?
“Oooh incredible attention to detail!” 😂
Your 3D printer is an artist and I get the  phone that a dyslexic demon.😳
on some level this is an actual example of creativity from a computer! it went rogue and brought an object into this world that didnt exist ever in history. It came up with a unique design outside of what the human who programmed it had asked it to design.  I know its a glitch but you cant convince me that I'm wrong.
Is this Gru? Lmfao 😂😆😁💀
Doofenshmirtz????
Now sell it on eBay for $5k, claiming it's about your "feelings".
3D Printer: jammed This guy: *ART*
The way he talks is cute
Bro 3s pronters are tsking over worls we gotta do somrtonh imamsdoetely
He sound like Doofensmerk from Phineas and Ferb
BEHOLD THE PRINTONATOR 9000
A ghost of an ungraduated art student haunts your machine
That's so wholesome! Others want to say his printer is broken. But no,  "My printer is an artist." 🥺
I guess you can say it's a *✨happy little accident✨*
"Your printer is an artist"! Had me laughing so hard! The part when you said " oh special touch " had me on the floor laughing! You are hilarious!
So weird I was thinking a way to help pull the heat from exhausts on my pc , had a dream I put a miniature traffic cone on it. Then randomly found your video lol. I love it .
When you forget to turn of da vinci mode
i want a 3D printer but i have no clue how to use one
i want him to say baby gorl
Why do you sound like Uncle Hugo from the Disney Pixar movie Luca
Didnt know Gru was into art
There's something oddly adorable about this.
Shouldn’t have let it print, it’s wasteful
theis accent is GOLD
Everything that get out of this guy's mouth is iconic!
True art
Everyone making funny or smart comments about the misprint: "I'm printing something *pink* " My brain: eugh crunchy noises
Ahahhahahhahahahahahha
So... What's the duct for!? #shortstgatendtoosoon
I want a 3D printer I'll get one with my YouTube money once YouTube pays me for once
Hes printing nicki minaj 🦄
But my printer is an artist!!!😂
is that Kenny McCormick in the back ground 😟
Oooo special touch 🤣😂🤣😂
He sounds like gru
Such abstraction. Bravobravo!
Can someone explain what he printed? I was looking through comments and couldn’t find anything. Like what exactly does it do for the fan? Also I couldn’t hear clearly what he called it 😵‍💫
The printer said this is my time to shine 😂
"cus deres a stooorm" my favorite part cx
*pfaa dadea cu grindina ai annebunit la cap
prussia
*Mission failed successfully*
Looks like a broken traffic cone 🤣
That's funny
"I'm printing something pink :D" he sounded so happy!
Oh my god I thought it was a springy road cone
3d printers are awesome. cant wait to see how small and efficient they will get. one day people will laugh... even more so at these printers
Bootiful
So why did he make that and put it on a fan
If dr doofenshmirtz had a 3d printing channel
Indeed very pink.
His voice sounds like this narrator from ze end of the world: https://youtu.be/Pk-kbjw0Y8U
finally, someone who lets their 3d printer  to be able to express themselves, more people out there should be more like you tbh
I’m literally dying why is this SO FUNNY🤣 I loved your vids, but I didn’t know you were a comedian ❤️❤️❤️
✨Gorgeous art✨
*LOUD CRUNCHING*   Ah yes, the special touch
If that were ice cream: Girl: what that      tounge do   Boy:https://youtube.com/shorts/jKh1PtUmgIE?feature=share
Esti Român?
He sounds like the guy from doofensmcherts in phineas and Ferb
"oooh, special touch" 🤣🤣 Literally my most hated sound from my printer made hilarious!
i like this guy's style
Why does he sound like that guy from Phineas and Ferb??
I was like is it gonna be a bird or what
I love your frustration at the storm. Your accent really pops XD
Him sound like squidward
Deu ruim aí fera
I love how after having that artistic impulse the printer tried to resume it’s assigned design like we didn’t see it just become possessed.
Your 3d printer had to much to drink
Ponk
Oooooooooo
Oooo
Needs Velociraptor Bone Infill™
Why does this guy sound like gru
Wait are you Romanian. Do you live by Bran Castle? That looks Transylvanian (the shot from your window that is)
Anyone else thinks he sounds like Gru from "Despicable Me"??
What printer is that
What can you do with support material? It's actually bei wasted Material but can it be recycled?
Wow
I was picturing it a bit differently but my printer is an artist 👨‍🎨   Words of a true legend
"I'm printing something pink!"  Sir I cannot tell what this something is
Man. That was funny as hell  lol  the commentary  Ooo a special touch. Hahaha man I have watched this to many times
Your humor cheered me up! Love your optimistic take on the situation 🙂
Best short I've ever seen omg I love this
Cuz theres a storm For me to poop on
Is this for a miner? And what’s the purpose? And where can I get
When the power goes off, edit the gcode... remove all the code until your correct z layer and print the remaining 😉
the thing in the background looks like kenny mccormic.
Love this
Wow I was wondering if you got your photos printed?
CUZ THERES A STORM
he sounds like dexter from dexters laboratory but all grown up
Despicable me in the storm scene! 💙💙💙
Lolllllll that’s actually theeeeee worst feeling
I laughed so hard at "but my printer is an artist." my kids thought something was wrong with me.  Well done lol.
It looks like a shewee
That "ooo special touch" got me
Ur Romanian, right?
Someone tell me why he sounds like Dr. Doofenschmurtz
Suspicious.
I just love the way he says "pink"
When you can take a hit and pull humor out of even the most enraging results means you're worthy of a chad title
This man sounds like Koifish.  He probably needed to print a new fan for his PC after destroying CC3 for the thousandth time.
Haha. We've all been there. But usually with different reactions. Love it.
" Oooh special touch" some funny shit man LMFAO 😂😂
The way he said "And only 58 minutes." In a soft and calm way 😂
“ooOoOooOo special touch”
An amazing... *a r t w o r k*
Isn't there like a cancel option for 3d printers or a immediate stop or a pause maybe?
"But my printer's an artist" 😂
Help ! My printer won’t print past 2 passes. Any tips please!?
Set that on an empty podium in an art exhibit and watch everyone go wild
Kinda looked like a bat at the start
I thought it was supposed to be a cone
Truly incredible attention to detail.
Art teachers be like: this shows the industrial society and its futures
"You see that Cleetus? It's a pink traffic cone." "WELL GOOOLLYYY!! HIT THE BRAKES, HUFORD!"
Wait, you kinda sound like the narrator from the steam game "When the darkness comes"
It’s not going fast enough
task faild successfully
The noctua fans tho
If you taped it two the wall you could get a million dollars for it and the best part is you wouldn't have to worry about a roving gang of monkeys breaking in to steal/eat it.
Nice fan art
Loving that you’re so optimistic  Keep it up!!!
Agent P I have finally captured u and now I must show u my new invention the pinkthingenator!!!  UR VOICE IS AMAZING BTW ❤️
I love your accent and how you say “there, very pink”
Printer: "No, no. You see, this is an abstract representation of society and..."
Just gonna say i hate modern art ... such a pice of shit
That belongs in a museum
Why toss such beautiful art, my G?!😰
"Every act of creation is first act of destruction"  - 3D PrintCasso
Do godzilla
What is that
Almost dir
My Vertex Nano (same software): "Let's do that special touch!"
I have no idea who this is but I fkn love the vibe they give off like genuenly it's amazing
There’s a storm ⛈ 😅
When the printer goes on a rebellious phase and does it’s own thing.
I'm sorry but your voice makes you sound like a lovable cartoon villain lol. I love it!😄
Oh, is that what we are calling that?  Then my 3D printer has presented me with some works of art before too.  Next time I won’t be so mad and consider it a gift.
"special touch" with a delicate and graceful stroke LOL  More like spacial touch
This is funny as fuck
This is a glorious example of sarcasm
My real question is...what's a fan duct? What you use it for? :0
Bad dragon
OoOOoh special touch
How much is a 3d printer
you could unironically sell that for a good amount
My printer never goes back to the correct place when it goes off and I don't know why
Ooo special touch 😂
His accent is wonderful 😄
When somebody pays with "exposure"
Why he sound like gru tho
85 can be plenty enough if u can ride well its like 20hp and that 250 is a 4stroke wich is about as powerful as a 125 at like 40hp
Lmao
Now that is modern art
It’s beautiful
This was so funny.
Doofenshmirtz ?
Lol
Maybe I like goofy modern art too much but I think it's cute lol. A little more polished and I'd put that on my bookshelf.
I hope your printer got accepted to art school
"Very pink."
Why would you want that duct?
I love his voice
A storm made you powerless?
I love how you acted so positive to a printing bug, it’s super supportive and I love that positive attitude!
Whats a fan dart
Barbie poop.
what'll you gonna call it Doofenshmirtz? The artist 3D printinator?
😂 "i was picturing it differently but my printer is an artist" aww cute 3d printer has big dreams of being an artist ^-^💕
Wow. Decrative hat
LMAO!
That's kool and all but what is the funnel used for ?
Lovve your accent
U lowkey sound like doctor doof and im lovin it
It's trying its best, ok?
I didn't know Gru had a YouTube channel
What’s the point of a fan duct
Lol I like this glitch. More so if the ink is recyclable
I want that mans optimisim. Like i legit need to hold myself from brakeing my mashine each time this happenes.
Hi Gru
Lol really stupid
One day a storm came by and said "YOU DIE" to my WiFi
0:00
We joke but being able to do that reliably on purpose could be useful
LOL 🤣🤣🤣
TRASH LOL
I think your printer had a bad day lol
Anything can be a Dildo if your brave enough  Edit: spelling
💕🔥👍
This genuinely stressed me out and made me laugh at the same time 😂
Something PEEEEink
i bid $1.5M for that work of art
Has anyone ever told you that you sound like gru from Despicable Me?
fave part #only58minutes
Uuuu special touch really caught me off-guard
When be like fun fact:
That’s what happens to me and I don’t know how’s to fix it
If messing up a print makes a printer an "artist" then my printer is frickin` Picasso!!
Try making a keyboard please
I’m so so sorry- but all I can think of is gru when I listen to this 😭✋
u sound doofensmirtz
Instead of stopping his printer from doing what it loved, he let it have some fun before he put it back to work. This is how everyone should treat their printers
wait i he said "fanta" like a drink?
“I was picturing it a bit differently”
You sound like gru from the movie despicable me
Beatiful trash
Tell me you’re Eastern European without telling me you’re Eastern European
C O N E
With the special touch’
Art teachers belike: this shows how our society will disagree with our beliefs if they conflict with theirs, which explains the beheaded birdlike shape and its pink color.
this guy is hilarious idk why but I laugh randomly at whatever he says
Kkkk
My printer is an artist!  Me too buddy 😑
tornado
Forbidden buttplug
Aw man what a waste of materials. They at least need to do some resume after loss of power on these machines.
Ooou,special touch😂😂
Borat?
And why do you need that pink thing again?
Those things are so awesome.
I love your voice!! It's so adorablee
Looks like a cheap adult toy
Because there's a STORRRM.
"No power, 'cause there's a *Storm* ."  Truly great line.
OhoHoHO special touch Printer: CROCH CRONCH
Lewandovski??
Take no offense but you kind of sound like dr doofenshmirtz
Am I the only one that thought it would be a bird lol
I love his sarcasm 😂
He sounds like gru from despicable me
This is hilarious. I'm glad you can see the humor in frustrating times. Reminds me of when it was my sister's birthday and we bought her a cake. She picked it up and we were about to start singing happy birthday. Right when we started, she stumbled and dropped the cake face down on the ground. My sister and me just found it hilarious and could not stop laughing. Everyone else was shocked.
This guy from the audio in English Book :O
Next Harry styles I MEAN Leonardo
Peak comedy
Looks like very expensive pink garbage!!
Yes it does what its not expected to do, therefore makes it an artist. Good one 👍
No power because a storm... I tried to print a planter shaped like a castle, maybe 20cm tall. The power in my neighborhood failed halfway through the print TWICE!
3d printer encounter error Artist:"IT A MASTERPIECE"
that belongs in a museum
I wouldve thrown that hunk of shit into the nearest wall or window if I loaded it with expensive ass ink & plastic & it spit out that retarded fuckin thing
If you pause the video where Mihai is holding the 3d printed model up and look to the left youll see a face
Gru?
*“We’ve got a wiggly one”*
No, it just failed at printing that cone.
Very pink
Poor guy, he’s trying his best
Are you Czech?
Put it up on ebay with an obscure name+description and you’ll probably get 10k off of it lmao
"Ooh, special touch!"
sOoOoOoOoOoooO detail, lol xd
OoOooO special touch xD
Bro I love your accent!
Gru?
You will have to pay copyrights to use its ... its thing
My account profile photo
Am printing samthing pink
Looks like a parrot
"my printer is an artist" made me genuinly laugh out loud.
Why not use a turbocharger
CAN YOU DO A RAINBOW SLINKY?
You sound like squidward mannn...
“No power *cause there’s a storm!!* ” I feel that as I live in Florida 😪
lol his printer is a ✨artist✨ huh!
Verepink
Thats the only appropriate response to a misprint "i'm printing *something* pink 😋"
This is a MASTER PEICE
If someday robots take over the world and said humans are dumb then show them this
I love this type of video! Videos that are more vlog-ish are a lot more fun! I'll be sure to recommend these to my friends!
This video is what made me subscribe
He has the same accent as Baman from Baman Piderman omg
"uuu" special touch 😂😂😂😂😂
Do people in western countries really still have electric cuts because of storms ?
I will bid 12 million on that gorgeous art
I thought it was a bird at first
My printer does that to when the project turns out to be big. How can I fix that problem?
so what's the point of the funnel tho, wouldn't it just restrict flow
Impressive...  your printer was able to give it moving parts during  printing, and 8 out of 10 doctors hate your printer for it but would also recommend it to their patient
That’s what keeps happening to my 3-D printer but it starts at the middle
I first thought it was going to be like an owl or something
Still beter than modern art!
What did you expect when you use vase mode on something shaped like that
You should display that art piece somewhere
“Viry pingk” I love him 💀
This guys sounds like a mix of a show narrator and Gru
Is fan art
Put the fan backwards and u got a vacuum
gru?!!??
You should actually sell it
Printer:let me add my own twist to ur design
What a waste of plastic definition of single use
what printer do you use? the finished print looks very solid
Dont send him to art school or he will be printing a Panzer next.
Seems like some sort of bug from a game that I'd imagine being called along the lines of '3D printer simulator, 2K21, "patched" edition'
Thats one traffic cone
OMG that "special touch" hurts😂😂😂😂😂
I started laughing at "ooooh special touch" and didnt stop for 3 whole replays.
Sorry for taking your power.
Lol
Instead it's gorgeous art incredible tension the details LOL best thing I've seen on the internet
Special Touch lol
His voice is so soothing and silly. Like a Saladfingers episode for Kids.
Noctua fan ?
OOooooooooOoOOooooO  *special T OU C H E*
Wow trash content
Whats this for
dank memer: *mwahahahhaha* 😈
Don't throw that! In this day and age that's fine art. Make some money dude.
I dunno man, every prusa I've seen in person has been broken in some way shape or form
The 3d printer was just being creative
You should do a podcast your voice is relaxing
You said storm and my husky named storm looked at me
Comment
Doofenschmirtz is that you?
OOoOoOoh SpEcIaL tOuCh   Lmao
I want to hear him say “screw you perry the platypus”
Proof that Skynet is real:
"CUZ THERES A STORM" got me lol
Modern art 😂🤌
The "oooh special touch" while the printer was messing up the position of the main print was hilarious.
Hello fellow Romanian! I would like to start 3D printing. Any suggestions for printers?
Bro the opening of the duck must be diverging instead of converging it helps the fluid(air) move more just search draft tube
Still better than modern art
You have such a fun attitude towards this stuff and you don't get upset when it goes wrong! You must be superhuman!
Task failed successfully
Is this masterpiece for sale?, I am a 3-D printer artist myself and never have I seen such great craftsmanship in an art piece.
“Theres no power” me being South African “ESKOM”  him “cuz theres a storm” me “oh yeah its only in sa” 😭
'3D printer, becoming human'
Could you 3D print me an rtx 3080
When you said “there’s a storm!” You sounded like gru 😂     Just me? Ok..
Oooh.. The final touch 😂
Beautiful*
Im convinced that first one would sell for millions if you named it some shit like “despair on Sunday, 3D art”.
:                 )
"My printer is an artist!" I laughed so hard
*it's becoming sentient*
Hey I actually have a problem with mine printing in air. At first I thought it was a leveling issue but it's still leveled is. What else could it be??
I l o v e your accent
You could literally sell it for a couple million dollars as a first artwork made entirely by a 3d printer
Only 1 hour? Nice
This is epic! Posted to Reddit: My 3D printer is an artist (not mine) https://reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/oaespx/my_3d_printer_is_an_artist_not_mine/
You live in the Midwest too?
Update: his printer just cut it's microphone off      That was a Van Gogh ear joke
The fact of what the first one was supposed to look like was mess scared me lol
Geørgeos årt
Sounds like gru lol
Wait... What do you actually do if one of the prints failed?
Couple questions. 1) What causes this kind of mistake? Happened to me once or twice and I don't remember why.   2) Is there an STL or gcode of that fan duct?
Are you from romania?
The 3-D printer : It’s my day off why are you making me bring something
What's up my Romanian friend?
Wtf is that
Very pink indeed
so beautiful
This made my day
Ok I just have to say that I love your voice
I love how you talk sounds funny makes me laugh the hole time and i like the end you said 💖~!?Vëry pïnk?!~💖,✨🌹XD🌹✨.
But my printer is and artist~  They way that was said.
STOM!!! 😆
Oouououoooo special touch
When you forgot z hop
What is it is art??   SO Beauty
He sounds kinda like borat 😂😂
Nice way to say it fucked up
Thats one nice fanart
Is that his real voice?
I had a nice laugh, thank you
Send this piece of art to the 3d printed fan review guy \o/
e
Your printer is the Picasso of 3D objects
Anyone else now rice his change in acent
How does it do that
What's the final product tho
I like you
*Glitch isn't art. Your printer is defective. Get it checked. Effeminate engineer with LONG FEMININE HANDS.*
I was thinking something etirely different.
In the next vid say get to the Choppa or get to the maple syrup please
Your commentary made the best out of this shitty print :D
It’s trying it’s best ok?
"my printers an artist" that literally killed me lol
I heard "Fanta" everytime he said Fan Duct (I didn't know what it was called until I checked the comments lol) or maybe i am just thirsty idk.
Power is out must have remc
There’s usually no power on quite a regular basis for everyone in my country, but it’s because the government is corrupt and allowed the power-plants to go to shit over the last 20 years.
WHY DID YOU PRINT IT YOU CLEARLY WERENT SUPPOSED TO ITS GONNA CURSE YOUNOR SOMETHING
If it had been artistic from the start it would be priceless. The logical part at the bottom destroys the piece.
A 2D printer is a pencil
Why does sound like dr doofinshmirtz in a good way
There's a fine line between being artistic and autistic
He making a twin turbo pc fan?
This 3D printer is my spirit animal or spirit machine in this case
Plot twist: the printer was tying to put a  aerodynamic spike for some reason
Salut Mihai!
Wow
"Cuz THErs A StOrmm"
I understand you man, this storm won't end! I'm also tired of electricity shortages and cloudy sky.
you speak like jonas tyroller. his twin
Your voice like DOOFENSMIRTH
You've no idea how much I needed to see this after many a failed print, especially since you and marsgizmo were the reason I'm getting into 3d printing
This dude sounden like dr dufinshmirts
holy shit that's amazing 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😳😳😳😳😳💖💖💖💖💖💖🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Idk why but it makes me think of the bubblegum tower from adventure time elementals
Îmi place ce faci! 👍🙂
What is his accent? I feel like I should know but I don't.
Cuanto te costo
My Brain went What is going on
Be careful of the design of the fan duct, the air flow can actually stall of too steep inclines etc. So there was a video of a guy testing it against table tennis balls and it actually reversed on him causing it to suck and now blow even though he orientated the fan both ways.
Bahaha! I seriously think you may be my favorite personality on the Tube of Yous. 🙃
Cool!
I guess you made the printer print in fast mode which is pretty much one continuous line.
Your printer has been temporarily possessed by Salvador Dali.
"I'm printing something pink." He said it so calm and sweet, while other people might've went furious about this printer. 😅
Congrats on 30 k , went from 20 to 30k in just a week
I wish I had one
I went looking to see if you had any non-adhd videos, and you have a few. They were really enjoyable. I'd love to see more long form videos from you about this stuff.
Can you make a figure that move hands and legs pls
He sound like gru from despicable me
You are romanian
That looks like a chicken 🐔 on stage
Foarte tare canalul vad ca ai crescut si bine tine o tot asa ! Super contentul👍🏽
Hi fellow Romanian!
Gru?
Where you come from? I love your voice!
Your chanel name is same as my name
His voice is so soothing lmao
The special touch really got me.
I like this guy’s accent
3D printers really making anything to justify the purchase
Hey make sure to get a whole house surge protector to make sure you don’t fry the printers!!
It’s ok he’s doin his best
its so weird to see that power outage is a thing in other countries. in germany we maybe habe an outage once every 5 years…
I bet if you scale it up and auction it some rich dude will buy it and say “Ya I’m so elite I bought this exquisite sculpture”
I love hkw if i just see a small fuck up, i stop it, but now i see it's art
Can I have the STL? 😂
Where does that fanduct go?
This funnel looks evil. In the sense that it's back pressure is pretty high, it might not let through much air.
Hi, can you make a truck?
Is that the fan duct for the new PitStop XL? xD
Due to the size of the fan duct I expect you are building at least a baby elephant size 3D printer (with a diesel engine to power the extruder)
If that’s what you call an artist than my printer has to be the most famous artist lol
So, why did it fail?
Isn't it bad to put a fan duct on an axial fan? It does pretty much nothing for airflow
How many 3d printers do you have?
Mine is too!😅
Haha
Sometimes prints fail in the most spectacular ways!  :D
This dude has the most calming voice like he could be a golf commentator with that voice.
The 3D printer owning experience :))))
Damn man… even if you mess up it looks better than anything I print 😅
Looks about right🤔
First thought, looks like the Witch hat 😂 Wonderful fail! 😎
