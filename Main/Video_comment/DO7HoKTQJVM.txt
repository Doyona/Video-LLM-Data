King of heart John Cena ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cena Record in Wrestlemania 🐯 Cena Record in summer slam 🦫
Way is Roman Reigns always losing word wars to John Cena  ?
Roman is still a fool. And not the guy.
0:09 first 1 2 3
Cena's first 1 2 3 0:09
Cena talks too much 😂😂😂
Whenever a heel champion in the prime of his career says he's leaving if he loses against a part timer, the heel champion is winning. This is what I miss the most about the Attitude Era and Ruthless Aggression Era. There were times when the babyface or heel lost only to be brought back storyline wise. Remember when Eric Bischoff got "kayfabe" fired or when Austin got "Kayfabe" fired for losing? Yeah that doesn't happen now
Cena is one to talk about ego. I love how roman owns him in one on one competition. That's great booking.
After getting pain from 2017 promo Roman finally learned how to speak in front of cena😂😂😂
1 2 3 you can't see me 😂😂❤️
The Promo is Real but he's not Leaving WWE
WrestleMania 40 is his Last Reign of 1.316 days started of August 30 2020 April 7 2024 Also John Cena and Undertaker Help Cody Rhodes The Promo is Real in 2024
2:36 the way Michael Cole reacted 😂😂
Roman lifted cena to give an F5
It would have been a great history between Roman & Cena just like Orton & Cena, etc..if both came at the same time.. When Roman faced Cena.. Cena was nearly done with wwe..
Roman really got better in his promo unlike when johncena promo's buried him
John Cena 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Cena should have won at summserslam, title 17 would have been a devastating moment and wwe blew it off, stupid
John Cena fans more than Roman Reigns fans...😂😂 Because iam king of John Cena fan 🥰🤫
Roman Reigns famous WWE for and WWE famous John Cena for
Cena didnt bring it like he did in 2017
Pat McAfee is historic on the mic!!!
Roman reigns get that idea from Brock Lesnar, because Brock did that to Roman last time😅😅
John is a little kid infront of roman
"You should smart before came to this ring because i smashed them so badaly as wwe had no use to do with them" blockbuster promo
1:56 now let's get back to facts 😂 Roman he has a full movie on him Fast and Furious series while you got a 2 min scene just cause of rock😂
Its three but he Book too late
John cena l love you and you are overpowered 16 world champion best in the world
I love Roman Reigns ❤💚♥️
Look at the size of Roman reigns and John Cena they are like a titans💥🔥
Cena acts better in WWE than in Hollywood.
Cena should ve won this one
I wish there was a proper long term feud between John Cena and Roman Reigns rather than switching to Brock and Roman at SummerSlam
You love him or hate him dosen't matter this guy carried this company made money more than romans whole career will make -

Slaam, hiii. Peace be unto you Mr.John Cena.🌹🌹🌹
When Roman says "You Understand" ,, it clearly indicates Roman's dominance over WWE. 1:43
Man honestly I was kinda disappointed on how they spoiled this match cause with roman reigns saying he will leave wwe if he loses it was just giving it away I mean obviously cena wasn't ever gonna win even before this feud started but it's just really disappointing and sad on how they just had to give away such a great feud and such a Wrestlemaina type match
Do they do this segment on their own? It was so heated and freaking awesome. Everytime Cena and Roman clash you can feel the pressure and anxiety like a different athmosphere. We need more of this. Could never get tired of it.
Roman: If I lose I will leave WWE Well congrats to Roman Reigns on retaining the Universal title
"He kicked out at 2 and a half but point taken!" I love this dude 😂😂
This went from “a match that could go either way”, to “yeah Roman’s retaining” real quick
Romans first line 😅😂😎😎
Two of fav guys bt Cena is always gonna be GOAT
2:38 Roman ia trying to be Brock Lesnar
Legend never dies
summerslmas Roman Reigns tonight Fight John cena
Who's here after Cena's Raw Return ???

Roman sucks compared to cena
I wish john cena will bring back THE OLD Dr. OF  THUGANOMICS CHARACTER BACK TO WWE LIKE THAT CHARACTER OF JOHN CENA MORE THEN THE ONE WE HAVE been having for years it's time to change back to Dr. thuganomics cena
I am a Big fan of Roman Reigns 🤙☝️❤️
Miss you Cena💔😢  I love Roman Reigns and John Cena ❤️
From india
Jai Roman Reigns
This is not good when wwe lose ratings  Wwe bring John Cena, John Cena =High Ratings  And then wwe make him lose   But it's not with brock Lesnar  Wwe book him greatly   Why!!?   It's like wwe taking back things from John Cena which they gave him during his full time
☝✨☝✨☝
1:35 Cena was ready to throw hands😭😭
I love Roman Reigns ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cena made a mistake by telling Roman reigns what to expect at summer slam instead he should have surprised him at summer slam
Greatest of all time the greatest of all time John Cena the 16 time world champion versus the greatest universal champion ever live
😂😎

Mr.John Cena,you're English is superb.

John cena 🔥🔥🔥
Stop yelling John
What is wrong with cenas neck
You know Nobody and I mean nobody can go against Cena 1v1 on the Mic and can literally destroy anyone but because of his character pg bs and ofcourse lil kids we will never see him go full savage mode like the 2000-2005/6/7   man just imagine him going full verbal
I love Roman his great man
He kicked out at 3 u guys just said it late
Roman has come a long way from that last Raw 2017 promo with Cena. What a transformation!
Hey I want to know something who won that much against wrong with Ryan's and John Cena would you please tell me
John Cena
Personally I think Roman acts better than Cena.
Johon ceena very great fighter😎😎😎
🌹🌹🌹
I love you John Cena Sir. I want to marry you.👰💍
Cena's laugh at Roman really said, "You had one job."
The i lose i leave wwe should only be used on someone's contract is running out, not a multi year deal top guy
SINCE BORING REIGNS IS BEING ABLE TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS THEN EVERY WWE SUPERSTARS SHOULD BE ALLOW TO TOO RIGHT?
Where is cena now after summerslam he is damn loser🤣🤣
3 countdown are finish clear see
We love John Cena batter than Roman reigns

Roman reigns someoslam John cena Chapmansp Monday night Raw
Maniac bubble😂😂
Reigns raising the stakes decided there he was gonna win, honestly cena should have won ending Roman's 1 Yr streak and breaking the title record they should have given him brief title reign like they did back in 2017 when he belated aj styles at Royal rumble, they could have then added lesnar to that fued and made it a triple threat maybe either reigns or lesnar winning it then, this could have been another interesting twist in the storyline .... As for the ones who will say it was for passing the torch to push reigns, it was already done at wm 33 and at no mercy 2017 after he defeated taker and cena .. Such a shame to see someone like cena used like a jobber every now and then
I love John Cena
roman reigns silence is verry danger.cena is loud but he is loser😂🤣
john cena should have won
Tribal chief
"I smashed them so bad that the WWE doesn't have any use of them do you understand." Wow thats one mic drop coz we all know what happened to Wyatt, Braun and Bryan.
John cena  would kill aew roster
Im not sure where that john cene promo was going after realising he loses lol
you caan seee meee
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin!!!!!
Trojan force vs Jimi sierra
2:37 lol roman reigns is also a cheater .cena never cheats cena is best
John cena is best
John Cena my favourite
Nice John
Dude Roman if Paul Heyman and The USO’s with you in a corner you won’t be Champion material. This was the same promo from 4 years ago. You have this huge problem with John Cena. Look in 4 years ago Cena did said he can face anyone with a certain WWE Superstar. Then comes out Roman Reigns to stark his nose to Cena’s business. Dude that’s not good for business Cena faced Roman in No Mercy 2017. Roman dude Cena came back because you didn’t get the job done and probably didn’t learn his lesson when he faced Cena. He comes out and always interrupts John Cena for everything. This man is a 16th time Champion he will break the record Ric Flair to be the 17th time Champion and my time is now recognize.
Cena
fire reigns we dont like him thanks bye
2:40 😂😂😂 123
123 😂😂😂
The whole 9
1:36 facts. Strowman, The Fiend, Kevin Owens, Daniel Bryan. Another fact is he even beaten them before in his face times when all of them were either in there prime time or early days.
Roman reigns cheater
Right now and we will need a lot to be qycuni Right away so that you
1 2 3 ☝️✌️👌
cenaaaaa
I love you Roman rangers
wwe again you have blocked your videos of smackdown  of last week and this friday unblock your videos now
Brother , sister and girlfriend  Where you watching wwe LIVE .?
Roman is young cena is too old cena is not the same the reason he loss
Peacemaker vs. Lobo
What an acting
Right at 2:29, random dude saying "what" 😂
Cena plz kindly retired you dnt deserve WWE play bzc you old man person why you come here
Because im jhon cina ✋👐
literally I hated him since day 1 ...Now I acknowledge him more than anyone
AEW
That " You Understand" from Roman was loud and Clear and very strong. His too good
John Cena you're amazing I respect I love you never give up✅✅✅✅🥰🇪🇹💪💪💪💪
If there is broc Lesner he do F5 to JC
2:43  He kicked out 2 and a half😂😂😂😂😂 Ohh man Pat Mcafee 🔥🔥🔥😂
Jhon cena best
Never believe in Cena's words. I have seen many parrots  blabering what they have been told.😅😅 Roman is a man of his words. Believe him if he says he will..that happens.😁✌
Roman is best
1 2 3😃😃😃😃😃
1 2 3... And the loser is.... John Cena!
Cena op
Very good
“I smash ‘em so bad that WWE don’t have a use for ‘em anymore” that’s a HARD line, ‘cause he ain’t lying (Bray, Bryan, Strowman) and guys like KO and Cesaro haven’t sniffed the main event since.
02:33 Roman Reigns trying to be Brock Lesnar 😂...but Cena was experienced for this😂
The fact that cena never beat reigns
Roman:" number of AA's I'll kick out1,2,3."
Never  give up
Roman reigns : I don't think so
Cena comes- the crowd cheers- tickets are sold- Cena loses- And he's gone till the next main event or till the time WWE doesn't need him anymore.      And the chain goes on....
Well WWE has made up its mind, that Cena's time is over. Doesn't matter how vigorously he fights , they just use him to sell their tickets... Well his entrance, in itself, brings back a hell lot of memories, I can't deny that😔
THERE BICEPS ARE EQOUAL IN SIZE ,ROMAN HAS WORKED HARD .
Im ashamed of romans really bro
Jonn Cena is legend
Jhone cena always love you
I camed here how john cena is over smart lie as
"He kicked out at 2 and a half but point taken!"   Pat Mcafee 2021
Brock vs roman vs cena triple threat 🔥
Roman best
Cm punk cm punk
cm punk aew Roman reigns wwe
Love wwe
What happened to his blowing kiss
He didn't forget his text this memo?
Clearly aew is better wee is on the fall
Î love John Cena MERI jann 🔥🥰❤️
Cm punk is back 🔥🔥🔥
Cena is made to look so weak in summerslam. 🥶
That was 3 tho 🤣
Enough with the Punk references
2:36
Roman is boring, Brock is more boring. WWE is investing in boring.
Yeah the "Either I leave with this title or I leave the company!" stipulation basically sealed the fact that John Cena was there to put Roman Reigns over as a heel champion! John Cena will only come back from time to time to put other talent over. His time as the main guy in WWE has been over since the late 2010s. Just like Goldberg. He won't be winning any matches he wrestles. He's only going to put younger talent over. Typical WWE. Too predictable! Unlike AEW which has been holding matches with unpredictable outcomes!! That's what wrestling is about! You don't see what's coming down the road! With WWE, it's nothing more than a glorified men's soap opera which you know what's going to happen over a year ahead of time. Never fails.
When he said that , that means he already won the match because noway roman is leaving
although cena lost at summerslam, he is always the legendary john cena and soon hopefully he can get that 17th championship win
Cena all day.
Roman reings win
Jhonn 1 2 3 KO Roman 3 2 1 WIN
2:41 this is where roman got defeated by jhon
Cena losing some size for them movie roles.
Is this Crazy Guy copying Brock Actions or What I Miss The Old Roman reigns He Was Fast And Flexible  Now He is Just A Heavy Weight Guy
2:35 John Cena was like: *Nah i think you don't remember what i said to you a few minutes before*
Roman to Cena : I just need 1 2 3  To send you straight back Hollywood
The Beast Incarnate is back💀💀
Cena utterly no-sells everything Reigns says.  Cena looks like he’s about to burst out laughing, and it blows Reigns’ confidence on the mic.
After this Vince McMahon took Michael Cole back stage and taught him how to count properly
What a stupid stipulation and way to undermine any sense of suspense this could have had.   Putting his career on the line was basically WWE telling you the outcome of the match.
Cena is a stellar wrestler, but mistake evolution was any early celebration within especially being in the presence within reigns, which is another stellar wrestler as well. These two should look into teaming, they argue like real brothers do, being said is a natural sign they do like each other, but wont admit it out of pride. But what a team these 2 top level wrestlers would make. Both hold belts like no tomowrow. They together would be virtually impossible to beat. Possible if one or the other didnt feel there best on a given day yes, but when 100%, virtually impossible. Only the rock, with another top level partner would have a chance, no others should attempt. They will embarrass themselves ring wide. Reigns reminds me of the rock, funny guys. But both are masters at separating fun time, from toss time, tossing there opponents like a caesars salad when nessesary.
Easy as 1-2-3 summer of Cena!
I love you John cena ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
John Cena is just the best, guys I have got viral contents 🥰
I knew Roman Reigns was gonna win when said he was walking go out as champion or leaving WWE
You already know that after roman said he would leave if he lost that WWE would make him retain the title because they cant lose their best superstar

I am your new Subscriber
Wtf was that summerslam
Idk why... But I know this logic.. if in the promo cena loses the bout.. then he's gonna win the match.. if in the promo if he does the finisher on his opponent then he's gonna lose... 😂😂😂
and just like that roman destroyed john
The sad part was Cena wasn’t perfect and it cost him the win
I knew Roman was gonna win. He prepared his self
Cena should of won that match roman is way over hyped
John cena jitega
John cena
So basically john cena cant come every week and defend title in other hand maybe wwe have some plans for roman reigns like movies. I dont know whats gonna happen and which one of them will get the title.
Loved how pat pointed out that it was a two and a half lol 😂
I can't believe John Cena returns
The Beast is Back.. Brock Lesnar 🔥
I thought John Cena was carrying on in his Movies like The Suicide Squad 2021 and X-Traction with Jackie Chan instead of WWE!
Spoiler. Cena lost 😭
Roman you r not broke who will give f5 🖕🖕🤣
Roman didnt kick out...Cena left him after counting 1, 2 ,3
Roman defeated John cena🔥🔥🔥🔥 And Still The UNIVERSAL CHAMPION ROMAN REIGNS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The match was incredible
WWE deleting CM Punk comments? LOL

Roman Reigns just beat John Cena again.
Cena is so desperate to become Dwayne The Rock Johnson, mimicking him in every way. Now trying to repeat what he did to him 10 years back, how The Rock burried him so deep that he couldn't stand up ever again.
john cena
he’s only good at words
JOHN CENA 🔥🔥
Roman will win
Way to get my hopes up
CM punk is back.....AEW go guys
That stake roman put in made it an automatic win. Who writes this?
John cena is best
Roman won
As all know roman only gonna win coz its wwe all matches are fixes
I love you johnnn
This aged well
Roman 🔥🔥
Dfntly cena will lose
I am unsubscribe wwe...bcz cena deserve better
I fell sorry for roman because first Edge attacked him then john cena challenged him but he won then unexpectedly Brock Lesnar showed up idk whats happening with him
Wee post fans , cena loss is biggest heartbreak
thankyou for ublocking your videos i want brock lesnar vs roman reigns vs john cena but paul heyman is confused where should i go? hahaha
Wtf...wwe is now just using cena for trp  This is the reason no one watches wwe and prefer aew Thank God Punk is Back!!
Cena can Count 123 Lol But Roman ❤️ Reigns 💪🏽💪🏽 gone get the 123💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🙂
Just saw the match and was greatly disappointed and furious that Vince gave his favourite the win again and the match was pathetic on John's part they made it so that he wouldn't even kick out of one spear and by having Reigns say that he loses he quits that was the spoiler for the match and now it's pathetic.
I leave to see wwe (after roman win )
Cena lost again By the way we'll scripted!!😂
Raising the stakes?! BS...Roman said that he'd quit  if he lost. That right there was enough to tell that he's gonna win.  Even if Cena also had put his career on the line that would have been obvious that Cena would've lost.  Had they build it as Championship vs. Career, then it'd have been interesting. Why is it better?!  Cena has been rambling about becoming a 17x champ and making history stuff...what would be a more heel act than to make Cena put his career on the line so that if he lost he could never do it.
John Cena 😂🔥
Jone cina
জনসিনা
Reality john cena lose 123 backup Hollywood 😠😠😠
we hated roman as babyface..we hate roman as heel.... wwe come on wake up we people dont like roman reigns ....roman cant pull the crowd like cena like the rock like many wwe superstars..star is born not pushed.....
Finally cena pinned roman reigns 😂🔥
Vikas Yadav
साला जॉन बड़ी बड़ी बात करता है बस मेरा फेवरेट था पर ये समर स्लैम में भी हार गया तू रोमन 2 बार हरा चुका है तुझे 😂😂
Y’all saying wwe wouldn’t let him go, they let Braun and the fiend
Koi batayega mujhe inka match kab hoga
No one will win the match😁😁😁 Corbin will come and ruin the match and roman will retain the title. Simple.
Roman the best
Cena. .😃😃😁
Cena is too soft
Now it's more real for cena with his chant u can't see me:- *Return *1.2.3. *Reversing Romans powerbomb.... ...All matches up with "U Can't See Me"🥳
"He kicked out at two and a half I think, but point taken"--- Anonymous. Cause he know what it takes time 1  2  3.
Roman looks😍
I like Roman 👌👌👌
And got ducked by the beast
How to spoil a match 101!
Cena lose :((
CENA looks unhealthy,skinny on a weird way

Thanks for giving the match result away. Romans gonna win bc their not gonna lose him like this. Roman isn't going anywhere
Now I'm 100% sure that roman is gonna win bcoz he is not gonna leave wwe
Plot twist Cena still buries Roman
John Cena lose than Brock Lesnar return and Roman Reigns is shop
Yes 1,2,3 But this time roman did this and won this championship
Roman reings Going to win this match..... For soure.... Love you Roman..
Jakob Toretto Vs Mateo Hobbs
YESSSSS ROMAN IS THE WINNER AND  STILL THE UNIVERSAL CHAMPION 🏆 BUT BROCK LESNER IS RETURN 🔥
I just realized something, icons like cena and goldberg are not supposed to win anymore. Wwe only brought them back just to keep the ratings up, not to make the show good
In my opinion Roman shouldn’t have said that he will leave if he looses because it will make pretty obvious that he will retain.
Its so funny Cena pin Reigns 1,2,3 😂😂😂😂
I m so excited for fight of both legends 😍😍 Big for Roman reigns 🙏🙏🙏
cena deserve this  butt ROMAN goes win
The thumbnail of this video gives me the vibes of 2014 WWE days 😳😳
I love you Jon
Stakes? No It made the match more predictable.
Romam ringes
Omg I can’t with the cheesy acting I’m dying 😵
We all know cena will lose because they wanna push roman but at least we saw cena this year
123... And u can't see me  Cena is at his best confidence level first time after lesnar's fight
You know if roman reigns loses heyman will come back with brock
The head of table only Roman Reigns                💪THE BIG DOG 💪
Now vs then 🔥
It's not 12 and kick out
John Cena ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😰😰
2:28 well thanks for preemptively spoiling the match, stg over half the fans finna switch to AEW  Like, don’t make a bet the fans know Roman’s gonna win, ruins the whole damn thing, nobody’s gonna take down Reigns. Maybe Edgy Boi (Edge), Bryan screwed him at Wrestlemania so who knows?
does Cena look smaller than before?
Head of the table Will beat that cena guy👊👊
All AEW fans don't need to comment here to tell who is better the choice of wrestlers that build WWE like paul wight, jericho, henry, christian and many more speaks who is better. And what is happening with WWE is not due to AEW or CM Punks Return. It is all due to their stupid decisions they are taking from past 10 years. Those wwe fans saying CM Punk was or is not as big as cena or rock go back seven years from now and watch all episodes of WWE whether it was rock, stone cold, cena or anyone else in the ring everyone (u included) were chanting CM Punk, that shows who is bigger.
Join cena
John Cena ♥️
John Cena should win that's why we all r back ...
It’s not 123 . It’s AEW . !!!!!!!!!! That would be crazy if Roman goes there
Am leaving this arena with wwe champion or i m leaving wwe😢
Cena performance is always on top levels 👏
John cena🔥💪
“He kicked out at 2 and half I think but point taken” you gotta love Pat McAfee
looks like roman has fallen in love with aew
Roman don't leave WWE pls
I love how Cena basically said after SummerSlam I’m out till Mania.
This is soo good
I counted 3 lol dude on the mic kinda started late
Who cares, CM Punk is in AEW, that’s all that matters
Yar win pannaga pls reply
Match muduchurucha
Plzzzz cena win this time for the fans.
Roman is the best 💜❤️❤️❤️
Roman is best
Forever head of the table , king of kings roman  , jo aaj tak kabhi haara  nahi
I love how Roman doesnt insult the crowd like how a normal heel would do but Roman still has the control over it.
Cm punk
i will stop watching any brand of wwe if roman losses
Wow
CM punk as returned. I’ll see y’all at AEW 🚶🏾‍♂️
Is John is thinking that Roman Reigns will lose with that goat wait for the summer slam
Roman reigns supports here 🤘😘😘
I think Romen reign playing Brock Lesnar character in this days
Wassup Roman Reigns I'm a Huge Fan of you I always do your moves outside I love WWE a lot I watch it everyday
1...2...3...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman looked like a turtle when he was fighting his demons in the ring
Wouldn't be surprised if Reigns drop the belt and take some time off. He's immunoscompromised and covid is raging again.
Noooo Roman dont leave I have been your biggest fan for 7 years
Lord Jesus Christ is the Only Way to Heaven. Repent & Accept him as Your Personal Saviour. He will accept You as his Child. See You in Heaven. God Bless... ❤️
17x Champion let's go Cena
Roman to aew if he loses callin it
Cena love you
Yeah, give someone a title shot who showed up once in years.. Absolutely fair.. Hope Roman retains or I'll quit watching.
cena will loose 💔
I want Cena to win but i know he will lose. Because they are gonna make it happen on a much bigger scale (his achievement of becoming 17th time world champion)
John really well hit aa on roman then 123
John cena win summer slam and roman leave wwe for make offer movie
العربي يحط لايك
Cm punk!!!!
I would hate to see Roman Reigns leave Wwe if he loses but I doubt that he will he’s the head of the table he has a lot on his plate definitely more than Hollywood Cena
Roman win
2:41 lmao thats sus
Roman is aew bound
1:34 The way Roman says "John" Reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2 for no reason.😂😂
Roman is All Elite
Oh boy now that Roman has said that I wonder who’s gonna win 😒
everbody say's who win match
Let’s go champ 1  2  3 you can’t see me 🖐
que bajo de parte de roman reigns
CM PUNK IS BACK!!!!!
After that statement we know for sure that roman will retains
That pin by Cena was a gimme and it was NOT two and a half, it was a two if anything. Check your eyeballs.
Now I don’t even want to watch the match, knowing who’s going to win :/
ROMAN.
iit is Roman pucy down.....
Did everyone forget that Roman reigns beat John cena before 🤔🤔
Go roman
Roman still can't cut good promos, I mean he's is much better than he was before but he is still nowhere the level of cena, rock, hhh, cm punk and others
Cena is a promo star 💪
Roman ni haraga Ku k is na kha ha k samckdown live is my yard know😀
I really want Cena to win ngl
Cena is going to win by Desqualification... So Roman gets out Champion and Cena doesn't lose credibility... I said it
At first I thought this was a dead giveaway that Roman would retain but now I'm not so sure. Its possible Cena could still break the record and have a short title run before going back to movies and Roman has been champ for nearly a year so if he loses and 'leaves WWE' it's a chance for him to take some time off
Well… i was hyped, but they screwed it again.
Perfect Promo John👌🏻💥
Roman you are angry man but control your words
My name is Paul Heyman, i once managed the OG best in the world c. m. punK, the longest reigning wwe champion since bruno sammartino. He's greater than ma dog reigns. i was balling my eyes out and eating a bowl of ice cream bars when ma OG boy c. m. punK returned after 7 loong years. i love you ma #1 OG boy. My dog reigns dedicates this summerslam match tonite to you, the one and only best in the world.
Nobody cheered when Roman said he’ll leave because no one wants him to
Acknowledge him
oh hell no Roman what are u thinking we know it's Vegas but damn Roman
I swear Roman reigns was in the shield and John Cena was getting bullied by The Nexus a couple of days ago
Nomameeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER AN ME?!!" 🤣🤣  Somebody page Sean Waltman, Cena is guilty of gimmick infringement XD
❤️John cena❤️
I predict somehow Roman wins and Brock spoils the celebration
2:36 Roman rehis f5?
So Roman is gonna win ?  I mean come on .....there's no way roman will be leaving WWE yet  Thanks for the SPOILERS
Cena mic skills are still unmatched
Cm punk is back 💯💯 wwe you guys are gonna go downhill
Please roman reigns don't leave
Well thanks for giving away the ending WWE smh...now we know Cena is gonna lose(idiots)
CM Punk Did More Views Than This 🤣 SHEESHHHH
NXT NXT NXT !!!!!! TripleH forever
Paul Heyman- "But you still did it....went against your father's promise to all the promoters in the united states that he will never turn on their backs only for his son to take them all out of business...it's was never wrestling for you...you wanted sports entertainment not wrestling...you wanted stars not wrestlers"    The forbidden wall is broken.....wrestling has come to life for the first time in 20 yrs since March 2001 for a rematch with the corporate sports entertainment.
In 19 hours Roman/ Cena pulled 1 million views  In 19 hours CM Punk pulled 3.2 million views
Cena will win
i don't like john and roman can fight because they are two legendary and they are partner so i want to challege brock and goldberg
Romen wins in dominating fashion bookit
WWE seems so irrelevant all of a sudden 😂😂
CM PUNK!!
Summer of Cena LoL 😆
REMEMBER 1 2 3
If Roman Reigns will lose, he leaves SmackDown. Acknowledge him.
John Cena cuts another great promo. He can do this in his sleep
If they let baron corbin to cash in the mitb and ruin any match  then i will quit watching wwe 🤬
Cena vs lita procure no YouTube você vai gostar . 👨vs 👧
No one ever leaves WWE so nice vacation if he loses
never give up💚💛  ''one'', ''two'','' three''
Regina is winning at summerslam but the build up was fun though.
Brock lesnars coming back
Cena gonna return as dr of thuganomics lol n if not he will lose
Yea cena gonna lose lol
When Roman Reigns said he'll leave WWE that's how I know they going to let him retain.
(JUX) Oh man, I wonder who's gonna win!!
Roman Reigns go to AEW 🔥.
I kinda want cena to win to see what happens 😂
John Cena 🔥
aquí desde España. Me encanta esto, realmente no sé quién va a ganar. Pero hice una apuesta con mi hermano.
WAUUUU CM PUNK ITS BACK 🤘🇵🇪
Literally what was the point of that stipulation. Now everyone knows Roman is going to retain.
Wwe is so predictable,  roman is going to win 100% for sure. And AEW will be in great position as cm punk returns. I am slowly starting to moving on to AEW as john loss the match. Wwe bring back attitude era and bring back dr.dugnomics back
I start to watch WWE again after reigns return  N if Cena win I'm stop watching WWE again
1 2 3 Winner universal champion
All It Takes Roman Reigns Is 1 2 3 @ 2:38 🤦‍♂️🤣💪🏿💯😎🌟💙🎶👑🤘🏿
CM PUNK
Be Careful For What You Ask For Roman Reigns You Just Might Get It @ 2:08 🤣💪🏿💯😎🌟💙🔥🎶👑🤘🏿
I'm ready for this match not gonna lie!! 💯💯💯
Cina losser cina losser
😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Cina tslk tdlk  shot top
Let's go, Roman ❤️
Who will I pick? The two are my favorites
WWE Universe: Roman just spoiled the ending to the fight at SummerSlam.  Me: It was spoiled the minute Cena came back to the WWE.
People are saying that Roman saying he'll leave is just a hint that he will retain, I can disagree, Maybe it's not scripted, Maybe Reigns really meant it. So you never know, But if he loses, He will go to AEW!
John Cena winer ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
Power of roman and cena 1m + in 15hr
2:35
Maybe it's vice versa. Because Roman have a new movie to act :)
1 2 kick out ....... 3. Damn !
Team Cena like Team roman comment
This is the reason Cena is a G O A T and there's nothing else to say we all witnessed
Most awaited match  Roman vs Cena
Roman Reigns to AEW confirmed?!    Lemme stop LMAO
Love trible cheif roman acknowledge him cena
Roman is gonna win
We r with u roman reigns
Love u roman reigns
Roman should win by submission, that would be interesting.
Oh my goodness CM Punk is back on wrestling AEW 🤷
I hope Roman reigns wins today
This stake simply means Roman is going to win again 😒😒😒😒😒
Brillante!!
John Cena Is legandary of WWE history💪💪
"I smash 'em so bad that wwe dosnt have a use for them anymore"....this was referring to Daniel Bryan for sure.😂😂😂
Last statement of Roman proved cena ain’t winning which I hate to say sucks
if john was doing this in front of like brock, brock would have destroyed him
Cena😂😂💥
Sina ලයික් yu o
I smash em so bad we don't have use for em 🤣🤣 1 ,2 ,3
Roman wins... 100000% ❤️
NOOOOO ROMAN DONT LEAVE
roman Kicked out at 2
My fov John Cena I love 1 2 3😂😂😂
John Cena is too charismatic, phenomenal guy. GOAT 🐐
thats it no one is watchin that besides the live audience cuz that we was just stupid writing
I can predict the WWE match fixing 100%   Roman Reigns will any how remain the champ at summerslam.   WWE will not let John Cena win.
That was a 2 count 😂😂😂
Hey I've something to say . . . . . CM Punk!
1:53 This was amazing.
I really enjoy watching this Roman... And Cena is the goat so yeah
CM PUNK 🌚
John vs Roman universal championship 1 2 3  1:50-1:54 those eyes I really want to see cena win and probably Roman will leave wwe
I used to hate Roman reigns. Now he’s the best thing on WWE lol 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Crowd cheering for two things: When CM PUNK Made his AEW debut and  When ROMAN says he will leave WWE
Roman must kick John as.
Cena finally learned that 3 comes after 2 because he always used to kickout at 2
the champion is back
We want alister black!
After Cena is gone…nothing left to watch in wwe.  CM Punk is back thoooooo!!!
Ba ha ha ha like Roman Reigns is gonna lose & leave WWE, like I wish he would!!😜
if anybody especially finn interfere this match  am gnna be soo sad...
Cm punk
U make a mistake 1 2 3
Who's here after CM Punk debut on aew
RR best
So obvious, roman gonna win😪😴
Dumb people think Roman going to win
The fact that Roman reigns is automatically win now is bs 😭. They keep painting John cena in this picture as is he not good nm and continue to make him lose matches 😭
CM PUNK VS ROMAN REIGNS IN AEW  If roman loses and goes to AEW Mox vs reigns Kenny omega vs reigns Christian vs reigns lots of matches waiting....     We all ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIBAL CHEIF 🙌
That means Roman is gonna win!!!
I think Roll up is perfect medicine for Roman cause he just kicked out at 2
Roman's gonna win it's too simple. 😒
Cm punk returns🔥see bye bye
Cm punk
You make me feel sick John boy go away.
roman the king
John put em on missionary position
😝
It's not good because now we know Reigns gonna win, he will not leave now and he is obviously gonna keep the championship until next WrestleMania
1:10 Lol. The look on Paul Heyman's face is priceless...
Almost every upset in wwe has been roll up finishes do something different WWE
Ok what if reigns does win, so he made his promise to stay after beating cena then loses to a cash in? There for he stays still but loses the chip
It was 2.5 kick out. Pat was 100% correct. Personally if Roman leaves for a short period that isn't going to be best for business. What is best for business right now is the Tribal Chief as no way is John Cena going to commit his timetable as full-time to the WWE. So hope he doesn't win just on those facts.
No one cares John, CM Punk is back.
nobody cares, CM PUNK IS BACK XD
Roman’s going to win. There is no way he’s going to leave WWE.
all elite wrestling
That was 3
aew
Well we all know who’s winning .-.
It doesn’t matter if Reigns raises the stakes or not he’ll still win the match as much as I hate to say it… he’s way too valuable to WWE with his new gimmick. At Wrestlemania 2022 if the Rock comes back, Roman Reigns vs The Rock for the universal championship is more profitable than a John Cena vs The Rock rematch for the universal championship. I dunno I feel like it’s way easier to predict the outcome of a match when money’s involved.
i think cena is gonna win correct me idc its gonna be the best match ever all he needs is 1, 2, 3
😍
1:44     oh this face   🦁
If cena does win they will make Roman return a few weeks or months later.  If you don't believe me.  Remember when Shane McMahon was fired and returned roughly 9 months later, no doubt this will happen with Roman.
Wrestling is now the most BORING sport in the whole world!
" when people come with me in the ring i smash them so bad that WWE don't use them anymore " Underrated line cuz he actually did it  Bray . Braun . Daniel Bryan ...
The top face vs the top heel
What's gonna happen: Cena wins, Reigns leaves, Cena signs to fight Balor, Reigns interferes, Balor wins, Reigns v Cena rematch.
John cena become 17 time world Champion and make history at summer slam
Bring back the undertaker.
What's with the video quality
“Easy as….1-2-3..Kid!!” - Shane McMahon (during his WM 15 feud with X-PAC)
Comm cena never give  up
Roman to aew confirm
CM Punk
why are they making it seem like cena can’t beat roman and he depends on a lucky break to win....This is John Cena wwe come on
CM punk AEW
I bet Roman beats up John cena for 45 minutes then cena gets up like usual beat him with 5 moves and when he’s about to win big E comes out , cash in and become wwe champions
*Michael cole* 1, 2, 3  Other commentator: He kicked out at 2 and a half but........
Who do you got? 👀
Welp they spoiled the main event "ill leave if i lose" aka the champ will keep the title this bit has been done for years no one ever really "leaves" unless there contract is up an thats there final match thanks wwe
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Michael Cole has some serious problems with reigns. Thank God we have Pat now....he’s the best so far after a long time on SD
Tomorrow its. 1 2 3 😂😂😂
Smash em and Stack em💪🏾
So if Roman Loses he leaves
Imagine spoiling the ending of one of the only few matches that are actually good on the show by saying he's gonna leave if he loses smh , u know roman ain't gonna lose now , had hope for Cena
The summer of Cena line amazing reference to summer of cm punk
Cm punk, cmpunk!
Unfortunately , CM Punk just joined AEW ........ So yea ...... Bye WWE .
Hey Roman, your video did less than a mil in the same time that Punks return video did almost 3 times more than yours. Yeah he ain’t a draw 💀😂 WWE is 📉
Roman Reigns better be banned from wrestling before Summerslam!
2 n a half
Well, with a comment like that from Roman, looks like he's going to win.......
I feel like Roman going to retain the belt ????
goodbye rr
Roman : if I lose, I leave.  Okay he’s winning. They just gave it away. SMH.
That’s cool but cm punk is all elite
John cena is biggest wwe wrestler no roman reigns
Cm punk making his comeback in AEW was way more entertaining then this I must say. I love the WWE but AEW is taking a lot of their old talent. When Braun stroman and bray Wyatt goes there too the WWE is in trouble. There will be a WCW vs WWE war again.
Cm punk had a better reaction than any wwe show has in years lol
AEW just destroyed this PPV
1  2 3 cena suck go back hollywood
"One Two Three!" it's gonna be a feast😈
obviously roman will win since his character is strong and in no way wwe is letting him go. so predictable🙄
Cena🤡🤡🤡
John too much talking
Dumbest idea ever biggest spoiler ever, who would believe that Roman would leave, not even him believes it, wwe really messed up this time, biggest spoiler ever no way roman is losing now 😅🤣😅
Yeah.. that leaving WWE part is a spoiler that Cena won't win.
Oh god
Go to Hollywood Cena and ur boring words "one, two, three" Bro ur Time has over Let others shine
CM punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk!
Remember Roman said IF HE CAN'T WALK AWAY AS UNIVERSAL CHAMPION then and only then he WILL LEAVE THE WWE...With means it's not necessary to win the match,he can just disqualify himself anytime he wants.  I think something like this is gonna happen,Cena would be close to the victory maybe he will lock the STF or he would hit the 3rd FU and Roman either will disqualify himself with a low blow at the pin or he will use weapon to disqualify himself from the STF.  There is something that disturbed me more...Cena told Roman that he will see him at Wrestlemania Mania in Dallas with means maybe he will win his 3rd Rumble and challenge Roman into a rematch or he will raise the stakes and will put his career on the line for one more opportunity to break the record.And probably Dallas Wrestlemania 38 is the place where John Cena is going to become a 17th time world champion.  Remember how the theme song from wrestlemania 38 starts. Last chance The time has come Step into the shadows army of one  I mean if that doesn't scream YEAH Cena will break the record right there I don't know what does.Of course those are just my crazy theories but we are gonna see what happens.
If Roman loses which ofcourse i doubt than i am not watching WWE until he returns i also just raised the stakes for Vince McMahon
Roman regins wins 🔥🔥🔥
123 cena❤️🙃🙂
Someones going home
Hhhhhaaaahh very funny moment
Look guys roll up
Quand John cena bavarde beaucoup comme ça il perd tjrs
They are the best🖤💚
Imagine if Reigns actually lost and no longer appeared in WWE. If this were the case, it probably would be for personal reasons. In fact, I do find it odd that this stipulation came up last minute.  Anyway if Reigns retains then I believe WWE has a problem because there wouldn’t be any challengers left for Reigns except for Finn Balor. But they did not book Finn in the best light several weeks ago when Finn tapped to the guillotine and was choked out.  Maybe they could do another Superstar Shakeup where Reigns goes to RAW or they at least swap champions so that Reigns could feud with AJ Styles, Orton and Drew McIntyre (although Drew lost to Reigns at Survivor Series last year).
well i guess roman is winning this match
0:54 cena that makes no sense
This essentially proves that Roman is gonna win. They won’t let Roman lose unless he asks for time off.
Lets go cena
Why would they ruin the match like that. We all know roman isnt going anywhere. I doubtedcena would win before but now theres zero chance he wins. Why bother watching at all.
Bad move by WWE by letting Reigns say he will quit WWE if he loses , we all no he isn't going anywhere so now we all no the result for Summerslam
F wwe
Wwe better not mess up Roman reigns
2.5 million views on cm punk return. Compared to this 900K. You guys gotta pull out a card bigger than that today.  Cena Doesnt win. Yall Summer slam was worthless.
If cena wins I will cry
TODAY IS THE DAY
CM PUNK IS BACK SCREW U LOL
Flair is a 21 time champion not a 16 time.
WWE not letting Roman walk if he loses he’s just gonna take a vacation from the hard work he’s been puttin in last couple years n let cena take the shine while he’s still can wrestle n has the hype
They shouldn’t have done this, Roman was clearly going to win, adding this stipulation just made it more obvious
Bruh if that was a match Romans shoulder was up right away
Finn Balor will cost Cena the championship, a perfect moment to turn Finn heel again...Reigns then wins
Roman Gina win cause they can’t afford losing him
Great, now any tension for who's gonna win at Summerslam is gone. And even if they give Cena the title, Roman will probably just be back on Smackdown in the next month or two with Vince going "OH LOOK WHO'S BACK! WE RESIGNED ROMAN!"
Who was Roman talking to? I couldn't see anybody
WWE just spoiled the main event. I have a heavy doubt that Reigns loses the championship. WWE just won’t let Reigns leave WWE. That’s makes no sense. 1 of 2 things will happen: 1) Reigns beats Cena or 2) Cena wins by DQ, countout, or some other way if there is that keeps the belt on Reigns. I’d be really surprised if Reigns loses and “leaves WWE”.
This rivalry is gonna last till wrestleamania John is gonna take the belt Roman “leaves” the company couple months later Roman comes back in the royal rumble and wins to face cena at wrestlemania
The head of the table,john cena can never beat our tribal chief
Wwe just ruined the main event of summer slam with one sentence
I have a bad feeling about thisi😨
Cm punk back in wrestling buisness.. If cena and punk make one more promo.. That will be so insane
All I know is John Cena will break the all time wwe champion record at summer slam
17 time champ doesn't mean he is the best ever. What that means is that he is the best for one company to me being the best ever is if you won GOLD in every company that you have worked for every title you can get your hands on that is being the best. Yeah Cena he down talked AJ Styles because of where he has worked before as an Indie Wrestler but if Cena worked in the Indie's he would just be a jacked up roided up individual who can just talk and hardly wrestle if it wasn't for the WWE he wouldn't be recognized worldwide.
Cena Gone Acknowledge him,  Believe That❤✌
"The Fiend" better show up and destroy them both, otherwise "I'm Leaving WWE"
ROMAN YOUR FINSHED
If roman loses he will comd bzck at Royal rumble
Loser leaves wwe storyline 😒 how many times is wwe gonna do this boring stipulation that we all know roman will win just take all the drama out the match good job wwe creative 🤦🏻‍♂️
Cena win,  haymen back tracks saying no signed documents , makes riegns even more heel for lieing,  wrestlemania crushes cena, sets up riegns is better than Hollywood 🤔 cameo by hogan before the great ones return the following mania ✌✌
They not gonna let John Cena win the title so don't get to excited.
Confirmed reigns retains unfortunately
Vensedor roman
Yawn!! NXT is or was the best product until Vince squashed it. Don’t be SHOCKED if u see Cole with his girlfriend soon
Wow the crowd look well into this pmsl funny how u can hear cheers and clapping but everyone is sat not moving🤣🤣🤣
Cena's novelty has worn off again.
I think he pinned him just enough there to get the 1 2 3
If Roman leave wwe me too am leaving it
Well there goes Roman Reigns out of WWE
There is something I like about Reigns He don't talk much but always do the business I still remember how Cena talk before the No mercy and   I without Reigns n No WWE for me is a promise
Come on Roman Reigns✊🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dabal iuti ei superstar Gion sina
Roman Reigns: I'm leaving without WWE Title to AEW
Nooooooo Roman plz don't leave we need u
Let John Cena Win Then And Send Roman Reigns Back To NXT
CM Punk is bigger than the WWE. His return to AEW is bigger than what this show has been for 7 years.
Got 200 on cena
Cena is winning… 1.2.3 👌
Well that stipulation has just ruined the match well done WWE 👍🏻
Booking 101 on how to kill a match
What is Roman doing
All Elite will be perfect for Roman Reigns
Pat mcafee is the worst commentator of all time.
Can we stop these stupid stipulations that pretty much spoil the result? WWE think people can't think
Aew aew
Roman reigns is going to win because his contract is it over yet
Wow it's the same promo as last week...... poor creative. We're doing the same thing 3 weeks in a row. I'm ready for the match, but this build is very sad. Also reigns isn't leaving so the stakes are not raised at all. Lol what is it with this company.
Please bring the fiend back..
Nooo Roman Don't Make This Challenge I don't want U to leave😫🥺
Cena vs Reigns promo posted 13 hours ago: 908k views CM Punk Returns posted 13 hours ago: 2.4m views
Roman should of said "Taiwan is a country" and drops the mic.
Cena ran away...why?
Aew was better and it was only a hour
Roman Reigns knows he is taking on with the GOAT but I am pretty sure this gonna be a historic match! Roman deserves this!
Roman probably leaving because his disease came back and he needs a break, God knows they never wanted Cena to break that record...
Heres my scenario for Summerslam:  Reigns retains against Cena (no brainer)  Big E's music hits, Reigns looks to the entrance way ready for him  Big E comes in from the crowd, blindsides Reigns with the MITB briefcase and cashes it in  Big Ending, Heyman tries to make the save but is pulled off and knocked out by Cena  1-2-3...Your NEEEEEWWWWWWW Universal Champion Big E, Cena congratulates Big E and leaves to let him have his moment   The next week on Smackdown, Reigns comes out with Heyman, Heyman says the match stipulation said that Reigns would quit if he lost to Cena, not to Big E, thus setting off the Reigns-Big E feud  End scenario
Rip Cena losing again. But let one of the Uso's or Finn win the Universal champion
CM PUNK TO AEW CONFIRMED
Remember how many times Brock left but still came back
This build has sucked, they just made the match even more predictable
Roman reigns, time is clocking... he nid a hit bottom to wake up his naiveness
Cena is cringe
I can't miss this match🤣🤣🤣hahaha Head of the table REIGNS
The ending was a 3 count tho!
Internet Wrestling Community: No way Cena's walking out with the title. Also Internet wrestling community: Ain't no way CM Punk is returning to wrestling.
F wwe
yea cause ur going aew
My god Cena is the corniest dude ever!!!
Well, Vince will give the record to his boy even though cena isn’t a wrestler anymore meanwhile CM Punk makes a complete stadium stand from his sits
Roman goes like WTF?    2:47
You just spoiled the result of this match. Making me less interested in this match
Who cares cm punk back
This is the reason i rarely watch wwe . We could get the result even before the match nowadays . Sucks
I count before Cole
jhon cena❤
That was 3
I love Romn  Riegns  💕💕💕💕
Who's here to cheer CM Punk 🔥🔥🔥
This reminds me the rock facing Brock Lesnar summer slam for the title 2002 attitude era but close to ruthless aggression  So the rock leaving WWE for moments going to Hollywood movie  then return to raw as heel while Former WCW champion Golberg debut raw 2003 and Feud against the rock at backlash 2003 non title and lose to the golberg and the rock leaving for the moment while golberg taking over raw. Then the rock comeback to raw 2004 and help the man from attitude era Mr socker and feud  against evolution 2 handicap 3 wrestlemania 20 after that night the rock and Mick Foley lose from evolution and the crowd with the loud chants THANK YOU! the rock! Then leaving the WWE and rest for the year to make his movies until hall of fame  And leaving
Punk is back. This shiz is lame now
AEW
Now why did Roman have to say something like that? That’s like betting your ENTIRE fortune of sixty billion dollars on a game Russian Roulette or something. JEEZ!!!!!!!!!!😱
Cm punk🤣🤣
I'm praying Cena wins. They can do so much more if cena wins. Roman Reigns is gone. Cena sets a record. Roman reigns comes back wins Royal rumble or something. They could bring in old rivals of cena and have an 'its time to move on john'  like fued. Make cena rival with the usos to avenge their cousin. If Roman reigns wins, its just rematch after rematch. Roman Reigns character is fantastic but is gonna get boring extremely fast if something doesn't change.
Everybody Acknowledge Roman Reigns. 🔥🔥🔥
Cena teaching how to cut a promo!!!!!👊👊👊👊
NO PLS DONT LEAVE ROMAN :(
Romans definitely winning this WWE won't release him however I feel big e should cash in because then it causes a rivalry plus Cena can stay and WWE can keep getting more views and money because as soon as Cena came back views shot up
Still can’t believe how over John is, I like it 👌💯
Yeah this a cool moment and all, but it doesn’t compare to that time i met The Iron Sheik at the park. I walked over to him to say hello and next thing i knew, he had me in a Camel Clutch. He was squeezing so hard and wouldn’t let go. His grunting echoed throughout the park.  Tears of happiness ran down my face. As i knew, this was a special moment between me and the Iron Sheik. When he was done, i thanked him. And by the time i had stood back up, i looked over and saw he had gotten somebody else in the park in a Camel Clutch. I smiled and walked away, with my head held high and a very sore back.
He should lose on purpose then Wwe dying slowly might as well get out
If I lose I'll leave WWE . Sounds like Batista after he lost to John Cena. 😂
We remember when lesnar said that words, in summer slam and still the wwe universal champion , right?
Spoiled the ending with the stakes lol he’s Samoan he isn’t leaving
Well bye Roman I’m gonna miss ya
Roman's on his way to AEW....
I do not wanna see a roll-up finish. From either Cena or Roman. Period.
Cm Punk
🔥🔥🔥💪🏼
CM PUNK
It would be a nice storyline if cena wins under some controversial circumstances and takes off with the title and return @ wrestlemania. Having reigns rage.
Wwe creative team better not screw this up & let John Cena break Ric Flair's record... Hands down..
What if Roman loses and actually leaves due to the COVID delta stuff going on
i hop roman gonna win
OUTCOME 1: Cena wins but Roman retains the title. OUTCOME 2: Roman wins dirty.
ONE, TWO, THREE. Roman beast, but sorry... King of Ring is Cena. I'm 22 and I started following him in 2003, and I was only 4 years old. The King will take the Universal title.
1:40 is going in Brandon's Reddit video
At 2.45🤣🤣😂😂
Next thing you know, Joe Anoa’i is all elite, lol..
I was just passing by,this fools are loosing talents like Afghan with its residents,AEW is the talk of the Town, Rampage first dance, CM punk is back..2.3M views and counting
1:36 straight shooting , it actually happened with all of his oponents , remarkable cases being The Fiend and Braun Strowman
They cut off any intrigue with Reigns' promo
It would be crazy if Vince does let cena win lmao what if Roman wants to go to aew
John Cena haven't been watching this show this this is Roman reigns the tribal chis the tribal chief this  Is his island the island of relevancy Roman reigns the tribal chief samoan bad the samoan Superman the  head of table the WWE universal champion At summer slam Is John Cena will acknowledge him
Maybe Ric flair comes out to disrupt the match to avoid Cena breaking the record😂😂
اول عربي
This is stupid! Why would they booked that stipulation? We all know Roman is WWE for life. Where is he gonna go after leaving WWE? AEW? New Japan? Making movies? He's not going anywhere. Now they ruined the whole thing. They made it predictable that Roman is going to beat Cena at Summerslam. Nobody is gonna take the Universal title off of Roman, not even the Rock, or Big E. Roman is getting hot as a heel. There is nobody on the main rosters worthy enough to take the title off of Roman.
Cm punk
Is 1 2 3
How much you wanna bet the Usos get involved again?
Too bad this got absolutely OBLITERATED minutes later
1:36 I'm in the ring guys 😩
123 😂
as if we didn’t know roman reigns was going to win already..
Adding that stipulation makes it even more concrete that Cena won’t win.
Wow its funny how aew was able to completely overshadow smackdown with cm punk return they even overshadow john cena and roman reigns  thatd just incredible
👏👏👏
This is so stupid. Why would Reins do this,
I personally don't like how be said "if I lose I  will leave WWE" because that's pretty much a 99.99% chance he's gonna win now. I'm a roman fan and want him to win but I don't like how he said he would leave if he loses
ROMAN I WILL GO TO RAW
WWE is real
Hey look, this is what happens when you don't script promos.
I love Roman
Stipulations mean nothing unfortunately. They’ve conditioned us for that.
Roman reigns will beat John cena tonight at summerslam
Unnecessary
Raman lover
I feel like cena is kinda against all odds and everyone thinks he’ll lose but i think wwe is gonna surprise us with. “ 1,2,3 “ 😂👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
CM PUNK   CM PUNK    CM PUNKK CM PUNK. CYA LATER WWE 😂
Bruh why would Roman say that now he’s gonna win😑
Romangs reings ♥️♥️♥️
Now we know roman gonna win
Punk and AEW killed any, if any momentum summerslam had. Lmaooo
Who's here already watch Fast and Furious 9? There's John Cena in there. 😊✨
Now, we know Roman’s winning.🤦🏾‍♂️
I really wish they included the part where Roman said that Cena said a lot of the same, dumb stuff last week, but everyone popped for because he said the same, dumb stuff with energy and then randomly told the crowd to pop. That's how I feel about a lot of Cena's promos as of late lol
Why is Cena always lying?
Deym I can't wait for tomorrow's Match two main event Manny Pacquiao VS Yordenis Ugas and Roman Reigns Vs John Cena. Goodluck to this Great Athlete's 🙏🙏✊🔥
Roman got balls the size of king kong for that.
Cena should prove what he says🙂
Cena wan't to be destroyed by roman like edge
It seems too obvious that Roman would retain due to the stipulation. I feel like it will be probably a screwy DQ type finish or even maybe if either Cena or Reigns wins then we'll get a Big E cash-in.
Obvious he is going to win now..
And you wonder why the WWE is losing viewers. John Cena is just  more added poison that's ruining the WWE. worlds worst entertainment
Prediction:The Shield will be back together in a year....in AEW!!!!
Cm punk AEW debut currently has 2.2million views.  Reigns Cena segment 845k views
CM PUNK¡¡¡¡ CM PUNK¡¡¡¡ CM PUNK¡¡¡¡
if you know anybody says am leaving wwe if i lose you know 90 percent they gonna win
Join us for the most popular event on your own
Roman is gonna lose cause unfortunately his cancer is back
Roman said that because he knows WWE won't let him leave
Cena can't accept that he cant beat Reigns
I hope Cena beats Roman
Roman already beat John Cena at no mercy so he really doesn’t need his win it’s seen it actually needs to win but that’s just my opinion so don’t no one try to flame this comment getting all upset I did say it’s my opinion
Maybe Roman wants to leave wwe now and John will win
Please stop with the 1,2,3
And they will be finished once they sign more talent But they have to fire some as well
At SlummerSlam the champ is no more!😎
surely im not the only one finding this 1 2 3 stuff cringey af
Wwe is in trouble now cm punk is in aew
Even the Cena haters have to agree.. the Reign of Man Bun Roman needs to end.   Don't get me wrong.. I love the guy.. but I highly doubt Roman is still champ after SummerSlam and it not diminish his credibility further than it has since his match with Owens.
For Daniel Bryan
Anyone had any good Ice Cream Bars lately? Had one last night, it was fantastic!!
Summerslam better step it up after CM punk  showed up on AEW ...that’s the biggest thing in wrestling right now ...if CM Punk return gets more views then Cena vs Roman ..wwe is in trouble ...I play the lottery once a week in hopes I win ..and can one day own wwe when Vince ruins it for good
Now I get it. Reigns will lose and leave wwe then he will go to aew, were cm punk returned
But punk is back XD
Well if you expected Cena to somehow win at Summerslam the chances just dropped to literally 0% now
C M Punk is back
Cena has no idea who he is dealing with. Roman Reigns will destroy him tonight.
Roman saying he’ll leave wwe if he loses is a dead giveaway to who’s winning the match xD
Roman lookin SO FINNNE!!!
They gave the result of the match away real quick.
CM PUNK TO AEW CONFIRMED
Reign didn spoil, 1-pandemic may make reign leave for few weeks 2-its all about stake,reign decided to rise the stake,him loosing means he is not a tribal chief,loose to a part time guy, Love cena,whenever he stands in a payper view,he makes the stake high,makes it so personal
Is this where Brock will come back and Paul to turn his back on Roman? There is always a 3rd outcome 🤣
We we all now romans Finns win now
JOHN CENA IS THE BEST
2:01 2021 he still can't cut a descent promo oh my god
If Cena wins by DQ or Count out, Reigns will retain the title but will he leave WWE
I think with this match, the roll-up could actually be the most devastating move in sports entertainment 😂😂😂
Well if Roman loses then he leaves, doesn't that just mean that Roman will win now. What a stupid move. Had no clue who was going to win till they added that stipulation.
@johncena he is the legend man🇧🇩
Wwe ruined this match, roman will now win
Summer of cena, its like cena knew punk was debuting dropping all these references
How boring. Doing 1,2,3 every 2 seconds. Who thought THAT up?
jc 🐐
CM Punk is back!
Stakes raised. Roman Reigns wins confirmed
Imagine if Reigns beats cena and then Corbin uses the brief case to cash in that same night and winning , not gonna lie I wouldn’t mind seeing that  🤣🤣🤣🤣
John Xina
And there's all the proof that Cena will not win but brain dead Cena fans are gonna be idiots
John Cena vs Roman Reigns for the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam this Saturday. Can't wait.
How many times are they going to do the "I am leaving" angle? Its cringe & no one buys it anymore.
Ahhhhh come on WWE don't make it even more obvious that roman will win... big mistake imo
This is a battle between the two guys who 10 million people tuned out from over the last 20 years. What’s the stipulation here? Whoever wins still isn’t as over as crash holly was?
1.2.3 Bye Bye  Roman Reigns 😂😂
Ok, now I'm pretty sure that Reings will win tonight
That wasn't a terrible schoolboy.  Maybe Cena can be a 24/7 champ .. seeing as you pretty much guaranteed Reigns' win with that stip.
AEW showcasing CM PUNK and you give us this? WWE is dead.
He leaves hes gonna go to aew like the others
1,2,3 （笑）
Good bye
CM PUNK!!!
If Roman reigns leaves wwe it will be so boring omg I will stop watching wwe idk who will win Let’s see 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
If Cena wins We Riot.
Cena is a company champion not a real heavyweight champion like the real man ric flair
Cm punk 😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They giving the win to Roman since cena a part-time wrestler. They using Cena to put Roman over more as the top of the company. It’s a old storyline but I do like segments on the mic.
If Roman Reigns losses he goes to AEW
Meanwhile on AEW Rampage CM Punk is making his wrestling return.  The tide has turned, AEW is crushing it.
Well john at summerslam roman reign is going to hurt you
IM HERE TO DEMOTE UR A**! It made me cry 🤣🤣
The protected one just delivered the spoiler that he is retaining.
Cena will win big time
Why would reigns put his career on the line that’s like a face thing to do
The Role image of Roman now finally good !! cant wait for summerslam
If Roman doesn't win tomorrow he's gone forever
One, Two, CM Punk
Cena been acting heelish lately
CM PUNK!!!!!!!!!
Yeah now seeing this John is definitely gonna lose
cdna is always one of my all time favorites but this sweet boy cena does not peak my interest
Just leaving wwe
Daaaaaam last time I saw wwe before 13 years waaaoo😄
123 you cant see me
Now Roman will win Surely
Well, we already know who wins now.
raise what? if we all know that cena wil lose most probably get choked out... pointless...
Cm punk
We all know cena is gonna lose
When Hogan, Warrior, Macho Man, Sting, Taker, HHH, HBK, Foley, Stone Cold, Rock, Flair, Cena and Angle are in the ring… you know that IS them. Disappointment Reigns is still only playing a character. Poor👎👎👎
WWE writers are so dumb , i mean dumb af , the moment they made Roman say he's either leaving as Universal champ or he's leaving WWE you know he's winning the match, they just screwed a main event match where they made us bielive that Cena might win and get his 17th championship, now we know for sure who's winning, classic WWE 😞😒
We think we know who will win due to Roman quitting WWE if he loses... but truth is, we don't. Roman's been carrying the blue brand for a year now, no breaks. They're on the road again now. Maybe it's time for time off before the inevitable clash with The Rock at Wrestlemania, if they get to that.
Can you guys please make a full match for Cena and Reigns
Rooman is the my best
Roman to AEW confirmed! Ha.
Another example of wwe spoiling their own outcome. Went from wow either one could seriously win. To Roman wins 100%
Cena's boring promos... 😅
That pin was lame cmon cena😒
Funny how both of them were in the Fast and Furious movie franchise
AEW is CM PUNK
Now I really hope Roman wins
What? IF John win this title, Roman leaves WWE... This is a radical decision he made Roman... and if this will happen on SummerSlam, I guess he will come back on 2022.. i imagine that...  If Roman said that, it's because he will unleash this power with the Usos in assist, as to know him in his purest and cleanest strategy he got rn
That was a 3 count pin fall
"When people step into the ring, I smash them so bad"   AYO?
Reigns leaving wwe what 🤔🤣😂😂
Team Cena goooooo
Damn it now Roman will win they won’t fire him
Lol I’m sorry but the Promos between Roman Reigns and Cena have been HILARIOUS😂😂😂
Predicting the top matchs between raw and smackdown John cena wins reason why he doesn’t have the USO’s helping him this time sense there gonna lose that match against Rey and Dominic but it will go into a part 2 that part 2 John cena loses the belt because everyone gets tired of him Now Bobby lashly and Goldberg  Bobby lashley wins reason why it’s still the alimighty era and I don’t think there planning to end it anytime soon and Goldberg walks out retiring wwe as his debut ends than mvp for first time betrays Bobby lashley for next ppv or bray Wyatt makes a wild return to get the universal belt back
Imagine heel/thugonomics cena teams with brood Edge against roman and seth   Role reversal lol
smackdown is awesome but with cm punk aew may kill wwe
Jon sina😈😈😈💙💙💙💙
Ice-cream bars
Somer eslam😈😈😈😈😈
Who cares  Chicago’s boy is back this two suck especially Roman  Wwe in the mud
I really really really hope Cena wins and becomes 17 time world champ. However I doubt that will happen
HEY WWE 👀 CM PUNK IS AEW!!!!!!.  ENJOY THE DEBUT. 😎😎😎😎 Bye 👋🏻
Roman Reigns to AEW confirmed
Where’s Finn
Roman kicked out
Team cena
Pg era is dead. Come over to aew we got punk and violence lol
Roman win Confirmed, another ppv To skip…..AEW!
Something tells me he is gonna win bcuz vince aint gonna let his top guy go
so that means Super Roman will win again.... i cant see that that guy anymore
Cm punk
Cena will win and that is the pilot twist tomorrow
Actually it was a 3 count not 2and a half
CM punk return  😎 🔥
WWE is losing.  AEW has cm punk
MAN CAN'T WAIT DAMN IT !!!
CM Punk is All Elite
I think John Cena is gonna lose, but he should win because Ric Flair was fired, and they need a new poster boy lol.
WWE better change their plans and have CENA win the title now to gain some buzz, cuz after punks return summerslam is officially looking dead ☠️
Upset Alert John Cena winning universal championship Tonight!
Cm punk
no one cares about this anymore as CM Punk stole the show!
Do they do this segment on their own? It was so heated and freaking awesome. Everytimes Cena and Roman clash you can feel the pressure and anxiety like a different athmosphere. We need more of this. Could never get tired of it.
Here you have it, Cena is gonna lose again, I bet you a thousand dollars
Hear me out Roman retains Finn Attacks him Big E Comes out to cash in Corbin interferes and Finn Startes down everyone and holds the universal champion
Aew watching this like (❍ᴥ❍ʋ)
If roman does leave.... I’m done watching wwe.
Welp, there we have it guys, since Roman said that he would leave WWE if he loses, and we all know that he's not going anywhere anytime soon, that means hsle's gonna win ... LAME
Just means Romans wins lol
Wow! Now they got surprise roll-ups in promos too? It really is the most devastating move IN ALLLLL of sports entertainment
So no one talking about what Will happen if Roman actually loses?
Now we know Cena is not winning tonight lol.
Cena talks to much saying the same as a week ago I fell asleep …… can’t wait for the head of the table to smash him
Even in the realm of "sports entertainment," you really think Roman announcing this would be a "Win or Go Home" match announcement would get over more than Chicago's Favorite Son returning???
Cena will lose
1...2...3...  Cm Punk, Cm Punk...
Roman Leave....CENA Rocks...Roman Leave....CENA Rocks!!!
Cena is so overrated. And now is only an old hypocritical part timer fart
cena come only to extend roman reign as champion.. the tittle will be his until he break the longgest champion record
Now, this confirms Boringman Reigns's win at Summerslam. There is no way Vince let his current favorite toy lose.
wwe keeps getting horrible.  aew was rocking last night.
Can’t wait for the double count out …
nobody cares about summerslam but we do care about ALL OUT and AEW 🤣🤣 throw away the writers and let the boys be boys
JOHN WITH A AA 1 2- ALMOST GOT IT ROMAN WITH A SUPERMAN PUNCH CENA IS DOWN ROMAN *DOES ROAR* CENA GOES FOR ANOTHER AA BUT ROMAN DOESN'T LET IT HAPPEN AND SPEARR 1 2 3 CANA IS ON THE CORNER AND HE HEARS HERE IS UR WINNER AND STILL UR UNIVERSAL CHAMPION ROMAN REIGNS!!! ye btw roman will win
2:34 is he really trying to do F5???
This just means Cena ain't winning the championship 🤷‍♂️.. WWE won't allow Roman to leave, not when he's literally running the show (when Cena isn't there)
That was not 3
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
BEAT UP JOHN CENA
Keep yourself strong Roman 😊😎
All He Do Is Run His Mouth
I just hope Cena doesn't lose to Roman, bec I have a feeling that vini McMahon will screw everything up and let roman win
If Roman leaving WWE, I guess he will join CM Punk at AEW.
On paper this is the biggest match of the summer in years. What would’ve been more interesting if Cena would’ve put his career on the line. So this year at Summerslam Roman puts his career and title on the line vs John Cena who if he wins becomes the one with the most and loses Roman becomes longest reigning smackdown universal champion
(WWE SUMMERSLAM 2021 TOMORROW JOHN VS ROMAN UNIVERSIAL CHAMPION) DURING THE MATCH JOHN CENA PIN ROMAN THE USOS ATTACK JOHN CENA AND THE USOS HELP ROMAN
Well it’s kinda more than obvious now that Roman is retaining but still
❤ Roman 👌 John
WWE becoming trash compare to aew now.. reign will clearly win this Cena match up..
2:40 Kick's out at 2 by Reign🤣🤣 SHOUT YOUR BITCH'S MOUTH JOHN  !!🖕 Your time is up 🖐 Reign's time is NOW. Cena is good for WWE World Heavyweight Champ but not for This Title👍
Should've been a career match so John can't keep coming back. Now it's only a career match for Roman.
NOOOOO PLS ROMAN DON'T LEAVE PLS
Roman wins and gets gets attacked after the match by brock and big e cashes in my prediction but most likely won’t happen
I knew it was an " I Quit " match
One two three..cena wins
Pretty much the same promo from cena that he did last week.
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Same thing 2 John Cena
CMpunk
cena going to aew confirm
👎🏼🦶🏽🦶🦶🧀
Zhang Xena taking John Cena job now? LOL.
CM PUNK!
WWE Goin DEAD!
*CM PUNK*
Roman reigns leaving the wwe..... ... Me: no no no I acknowledge you roman ..please don't leave🙏🙏🙏
contract is already signed - Roman can lose and next week show up and say that leaving WWE was not in the contract..
Summer of Cena has just turned into the Summer of PUNK
I hope this will not end with Corbin cashing in, if it will... 1-2-3 goodbye WWE, welcome AEW.
I think Finn might get involved in the match
Cena just acknowledge u tribal chief...
Acknowledge the head of the table
Thanks Roman for spoiling the outcome of the match...  He isnt in a position to give up his title over Cena. At best even if Cena won for the 17th title record they would have made big E cashes in on Cena. He doesnt have long term plans with WWE. He is just gonna go back to hollywood after that
The fact that John Cena was repeating the same promo and Roman didn't tell him to shut up is just surprising
The raising of the stakes was unnecessary
Cm punk
Yeaa... Cena not gonna win. Vince not gonna let his golden boy leaves wwe. Lol... What a joke. But i hope the match is entertaining though.
ONE TWO THREE JUST LIKE THAT!
CM PUNK IS IN AEW
So guys idk if i dream to much. I think Cena wins and Roman "Leaves" Then The Rock returns to fight Cena at SS and bc of him Cena loses. At RR Cena vs Roman happens again Roman Wins goes on to Wrestlemania and obviesly beats the Rock for the Universal Championship. I know it sounds silly and we all would know the ending of it but i would like to kinda see that no cap
Thanks wwe for ruining the match we know cena cant win now due too vince having wet dreams of the head of the table....Way too write yourself into a corner creative way too go.........Aew  gonna take over.
I've got the feeling that Lesnar is going to show up and beat down Cena as well as Reigns, so  1) Roman will retain the title 2) Cena can go back to Hollywood (storyline injury)  and 3) Lesnar will have the next feud against Reigns (maybe also with Paul Heyman turning against Reigns in the end so that Reigns will turn face again).  Furthermore, I think there was also little "hint" in Cena's promo when he said he would win the title and then not show up until Wrestlemania - which is usually a "Lesnar behaviour". He also mentioned "Suplex City" in one of his last promos when he lost to Brock.
How is there not a downside to John Cena losing? How about who ever loses leaves WWE.
Им бы не сорится, а объединится и они бы стали королями ринга.  Когда они будут вместе, им не будет равных.
1:52 anyone notice how he forced his voice to go deep😂
Well now it's REAL obvious on who's winning
Sorry but cm punk return over shadowed smackdown the whole ep of smackdown
now im rooting for roman
So RR will leave WWE if he loses? Guess that's Cena not winning so
john cena will win
Either roman retains the title or (joe) aka roman reigns actually has some things other than wrestling to take care of, and will give cena the win.
Roman Rains always respect John Cena
Cena wins, Roman leaves for like a month or so, and then Cena does an open challenge for anyone. Roman wins title back.
Haha cena, u will lose, ur time is over.
Well that means romans gonna win after he "raised the stakes" so have fun getting pinned cena cant wait for that takes all the mystery out of a match
i am not surprised when cena will win becoming 17th champ to surpass ric flair who got out of contract with wwe ( & showinh up in AAA ) and to go with the idea of bringing the belt out in the barricade (when cm  punk said before) 😂
As soon as Roman said he'll leave WWE if he loses, it is now a 100% chance that he's winning. No need to watch this match anymore.
Lmao they gave away the winner of the match 🤦‍♂️
High stakes match, interesting. The head of the table is gonna do it again 💪❤️
Vamos cena
Hahaha Tribal Chief ; "When people step into the ring with me,I smash them so bad that WWE will have no use for them" 😂😂. For sure boss, Bray, Braun, Bryan etc are typical examples.
I think this was a giveaway that Roman is gonna win. He won't be leaving and he's too deep in the head of the table story line to let him take time off for any extended period of time.   On the other hand, why would they bring back Cena just for him to lose? And hyping up the new championship record. Honestly, at this point, I feel like it's a toss-up.
CM Punk AEW Confirmed… R.I.P. WWE
Roman wins but gets cashed in on.
So in other words: The winner is the champion. The loser goes back to Hollywood.
👖👖👖👖👖👖👖👖👖👖😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fans were chanting "Vacan Roman"  on the arena ,   i chanted  too.....  cover that !
Yeah yeah meanwhile CM punk is back on AEW
who else thinks  the 123 is getting boring
Another CM Punk reference “Summer Of Cena”
Tonights the night
Roman said Punk isn't as good as Cena or the Rock but yet his return videos have over 1 million views and this has half! I've been a die hard WWE fan but last night I bought Sling TV to watch TNT and I was more hyped fire that then I have been for WWE in a long time. And Roman Punk is better the Cena or Rock and he's better and more of a draw then you! The truth hurts but it will also set you free!
The Voice of the Voiceless is Back !
The best john cena👍👍👍👍
Big E might cashing in Money In The Bank here.
So John plans to win and not show up until WM?
Roman Reigns spoiled the main event of summerslam!! Everyone knows Roman isn't going anywhere therefore he retains
Just fight
"I'm Back"-Some dude from Chicago
Roman Reigns will win
Big e cash in
The returnt of CM PUNK was more important that all career of Roman… even this figth! LoL wwe.
I havent watched in 3 yrs why is paul hayman with roman and he doesnt wear his outfit?he has a beard and he has a man bun
My prediction is that Roman retains the Universal Championship. Then Corbin will attack him from behind and try to cash in but he can't cause he's not the rightful owner. Big E comes out, takes Corbin out of the equation and he does the the cashing in.
I truly hope that regardless of what happen, soon as the match is over... Lesnar makes an appearance!
Cm punk back
So it's confirmed, Roman Reigns will still be the champion after Summerslam.
🤣🤣🤣 boy
CM Punk is Back
Cm punk did 1 million views twice before this did 1 million yikes Roman eat yo words
Roman❤💪 all the way No one can stop him..
Imagine if there's an 8-man tag team match between Rey, Dominik, Edge and Cena vs Reigns, Rollins and The Usos. Dominik is gonna be proud teaming with some of the greatest superstars and we get to see Rollins team up with Reigns again as it's been a long time these two haven't been teaming each other
BTW. Welcome back CM Punk, we love you
“Or I’m leaving WWE” that’s how you know Reigns is gonna retain at Summerslam cause WWE wouldn’t do something that stupid of letting Reigns go
Wait whats gonna be better Cena vs Roman Reigns TONIGHT/TOMORROW?? OR CM PUNKS RETURN & 1ST FIGHT AFTER 7YEARS IN PRO WRESTLING ON SEPTEMBER 5TH???
We all know cena is going to loose
Your TOP guys right here. 673,000 views for this segment.  Cm Punks enterance alone almost 2 million views. I would say the competition just got real.
2:22 And there goes my hope for Cena to win the title. WWE would never let Roman go
1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
So Cena aint gonna win at summerslam then...
ى
Either I’m leaving that Stadium as Universal Champion or I’m leaving WWE  Wow😳
Now I know that Roman ain’t losing cus wwe ain’t giving up on him that easily😂😂
"I smash em so bad WWE don't even have a use for em anymore"  Damn, he kinda spitting tho-  Wyatt: Gone Strowman: Gone Bryan: Gone Jey: Sidekick Owens: Trying to stop Corbin from scamming people. Cesaro: Where's this mf even at?
I'll come back to comment when Roman wins.
I love it 🥰
Cena u talk too much
Fun fact: Roman Reigns has never lost with the Universal Championship on the line
If roman loses its only bc he wants time off for a little bit he ain't leaving the WWE weather he wins or loses
So roman reigns is definitely winning suprise suprise
When Raines is afraid of losing, he raises the stakes!) I immediately remembered the match with Brian ...
Reigns gunna leave WWE if he loses   not going to happen!!
I hate Cena!! Go back to china boy!!
هههههههههههههههه
"123 you can't see me" classic Cena 🤣
intense promo is what make roman shine. Not some dwayne's trash talking with smile in his face
What the hell Roman u cant be gamblin with yo career like tht i mean im pushin for him to win been pushin for him to win but there’s still the possibility tht Cena could take this one to the record books at SummerSlam then what Reigns gone from SD tht’ll just be another mistake on WWE’s part releasin another one of their biggest talents
Vince can't sleep last night
I walk out of the building as champion or I leave WWE & go AEW.  Well looks like WWE have spoiled it, Roman is winning.
CM PUNK ! CM PUNK ! CM PUNK ! CM PUNK !
Roman u still a trash heel
You guys still watching WWE?
All the way ROMAN REIGNS ,,
Sumemrslam haha. AEW standard house show is no. 1 trending and had nearly double the views. Oh piss ant company hasn't aged well. CM Punk, omega, young Bucks, Moxely to name a few. Just can't compete with that level of talent. Daniel Bryan next. And to think this was all done through covid. Times are changing. WWE is a dynasty.
If Roman raised the steaks it's probably cuz the reason is he's going to win they have it planed
Thanks  WWE...we all know Roman's retaining now😩
This is official Roman win
Well guess who’s going to win at summerslam spoiler alert not john Cena
Anybody who thinks Cena's going to win now needs to have their head checked.
Well, thanks for the spoiler for tomorrow.
WWE just sinking more and more with their cheap shot promo ........ and it is best if the commentators shut the f#@k up
Good promo seeing as Roman is in fact leaving WWE for AEW  Cena will get that 17 title reign  Spoiler Alert
Cena has him for like 83 seconds "he kicked out at 2 and a half"
I swear I can’t believe this is what WWE came too I miss the old days
Yeah Roman can go to Hollywood and make another  Fast film. Or another MARINE film, like Cena, like Miz lol
You know cena is on that god level when he comes back and can get something as simple as “1..2..3” over with the crowd. Similar to Jericho he can get anything over. Different level of connection to the current superstars
Kudos to Cena and Reigns 👏 and the others whos stay to the WWE because they are loyal to the Company
None of this matters. the best in the world is back
What a way to completely deflate your main event.
No oooone caaaares!! CM PUNK CM PUNK!!
Unlike the video guys, this doesn't deserve a like
Thank you cena
Jone Cina is My Idol.
If Cena doesn't win I will be extremely disappointed...
Reigns out of WWE and into Hollywood about damn time
CM Punk!!
Damn they ruined it now we all know who's gonna win 😔😔
Him mentioning Hollywood means him and rock at WrestleMania
Roman leaves = Roman at Aew
So it is obvious roman reigns will win
Way to give it away WWE
WWE just spoiled their biggest match of the summer in this promo 🤦 , while AEW brought back CM Punk , see the difference?
Ok when he said if he lost he would leave wwe now I kinda want Roman to win this Mach’s gonna be a banger
CM Punk
Cena shut the hell up with you my 1 2 3 how many times are you going too say it idiot .  I like you but if that means reigns as too leave wwe you have too loose
Zdjęcia Facebook nie Filip 👎👎👎👎Roman
Cm punk is back!!
I'm hoping for Roman Reigns to win i don't want him to leave WWE honestly :(
Mistrza John cena 👑👑👑🍾🍾🍾
Ayo who cares. CM Punk is back, but a good promo from cena tho
John cena is damn serious about this😂
Ok Roman has done too much to wwe he made them a lot better so I’m guessing the wwe will make Roman win so that wwe doesn’t get ruined so rip John cena
Noo I hope Roman win
Reigns moving to Raw?
CM Punk!
Who cares Cm punk is ALL ELITE
Cena's here to make reigns look strong that's it Cena ain't gonna win
Punk suks!
I don't think roman will retain wwe knows the amount of pressure with cm punk debut at aew rampage so i think they need a shocking act at summerslam to try and compete with the cm punk news which is why they'll pull the card of cena winning his 17th title
Although we know reigns will win. I'm still curious to see what happens. Reigns go to AEW and join Moxley.
well now we know who's gonna win xD
All that Cena needs is 1.2.3 ☺️
I’m team Roman 😇💪✊
cm punk
Future CM Punk vs Kenny Omega dream match in AEW >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Roman Reigns vs John Cena dream match. Now is when the regrets for putting CM Punk's health on the line 7 years ago and for firing Bray Wyatt recently, the only jewel left to WWE on a creative level, will begin to arrive.
So we know Roman is gonna win now
Looks like Tony Khan has Roman's number already.
wwe is in trouble aew got cm punk he is a draw
🤩
The WWE is dying and it's hilarious
AEW gonna overtake wwe
John talk too much but he will lose
ROMAN TO AEW CONFIRMED 💪🏻 !!!!,
Omg
Wwe will ultimately lose by make trash cena break ric flairs rec. Lmaoo that's the whole plot twist. They need roman. They dnt need cena, hell never needed him.
I was sur Cena will win but After this promo WE all know the winner
Well, main event is ruined 😕
Now we know wh9s gonna win the universal championship god damit
Title is for the chief
Cena wins, roman returns at the rumble
Roman to much hype brock will dethroned roman soon
A Day after SummerSlam:           Roman Reigns is ALL ELITE
When roman said I smashed them so bad they had to leave wwe , :in my crazy mind 👉👌 😳
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
roman couldn’t even attack him
ROMAN REIGNS - AEW ;)
Am I the only one who thinks wwe did this on purpose to make everyone believe reigns is for sure retaining but they might actually have something up their sleeve?
Meanwhile in AEW Cm Punk came back hmmmm let's see how many people watched that lmao
It's interesting if Corbin stole MITB from Big E, cash-in and win the title
CM PUNK!
Roman is serious that he will leave the WWE if he loses the Universal Title at SummerSlam. If that happens, the fans won't miss him and his family will be in shock to see that happen.
I want john cena to win but its just a fact that roman is gonna win. WWE needs new supee star afeter john and the only way for roman tp take over is by beating John.
That's cool but ... CM Punk is on AEW tho..
cool, after we know reigns will win, now we all know reigns will win. thx for the spoiler wwe.
so thats it roman reigns is winning
Aew had cm Punk
The most trash episode of Smackdown I've ever watched. Repeating matches 3 times now? Wwe what happened to you?
Maybe Roman loses and leaves due to medical? Who knows
Well i guess john has gone back to his rookie self using the deadliest move in his arsenal... the roll up pin.
C.M.P.U.N.K
Enough of this joke. Hope Reigns is gonna destroy him and going on another thing, and never, and I mean NEVER, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever, give the 17th world title of John Cena' s carreer.
So basically roman is going to win then 🤦🏻‍♂️ wwe is soooooo poor
CM Punk AEW: The Summer of Punk 🔥🔥🔥🔥
With COVID going up I can see Roman taking time off
Wow, any chance roman had of losing is gone now. Way to take any unpredictability away from this match. I hate this company so much.
Wwe is going to burn their most valuable superstars (seth rollins and roman reigns) for these legends. Hope seth and roman joins aew
Who cares CM Punk is back on AEW
that just give roman more reasons he should not lose
Is WWE still trending? I still tune in every week however, in other news CM Punk just made his pro wrestling comeback in his home town of Chicago....
This is what Jacob doretto did after f9
Romans definitely winning
Cena like roach that won't go away an so fed up of his show if stupid self stupes Regins need to send you to the hospital
O.M.G😱😱😱😱
Hope Roman loses obviously he just said that so people will think he will leave wwe...He will only leave for a month or two and then make his return
John Cena win wwe championship
Now I can’t guess who will win anymore since Roman said “He’ll leave WWE” if he loses, It’s a automatic win smh Thanks WWE
"either i leave the stadium as universal champion, or i leave the wwe" thank you wwe for spoiling the fact roman is gonna win
I have a feeling that Reigns is gonna win by performing his sleeper submission move.
Roman win universal championship Vickie win universal championship money in the bank
Does anyone know how long in advance of the match the wrestlers get told who’s going to win?
Remember when lesnar said if he loses to Braun Roman or Samoa joe he’s going to leave Romans going to win
RIP to all those people who thought cena will lose because he has to go Hollywood
man John Cena is so boring I really didn't miss him
I was routing for cena but roman held me thru 2015,2016,2020,2017 so I am stuck I don't know who to go for
EVERYTHING JOHN CENA SIDE IS TRUE.
Calling it now... New Champ: Sean Waltman the 123 Kid returns...
1 2 3 ? so many times, he is really the missionary
1 2 3
Roman Reigns is now a top tier superstar
AEW Rampage had more people
Well roman will win... boring
That's the worst stipulation. Now we know Roman Reign's gonna win for sure.
This is just getting boring…UNTIL TONIGHT!
Cm punk!!!
😀😀😀😀😀😀❤️
John Cena will win ,based on the facts he lost to Roman so bad last time out , he wants to get at Roman so bad
We all know Now Roman will win
lets face it everyone, Roman its gonna win because Wwe will not let Roman leave, Roman said *if he lose* hel leave shows that hes gonna win
Roman wins and Cena vanishes one more time into the thing air as he always does.
We don’t care, CM PUNK IS BACK
The best decision
They are both going away to do movies... Roman will actually lose.
Good luck gentle men ✌️✌️✌️✌️
By the way....CM Punk is back
ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
Roman to MLW… perhaps recruiting someone outside of the bloodline….
“Either I’m leaving that stadium as the universal champion, or I’m leaving WWE” Ah. So Roman is gonna win then? I don’t at all see them letting him go 😀
When does it start?
Roman probably wishing he could lose and go to AEW
He's leaving? nah he won't, Tribak Chief will win
Someone said it like 2 weeks ago  But roman does looks like a mafia boss If he has a movie where he plays a mafia boss I'd pay money to see it
Basically what Roman is saying is that he wants to leave WWE and go to AEW and be with the BEST IN THE WORLD 🌎 CM Punk !!!!!! Ya for those that don’t know .... he’s back !!!!!!
Well we know WWE won't let their main star leave so I guess John Cena is losing at Summerslam.  Pretty obvious anyway, everyone gets jobbed out to Roman
Love how in one promo Nikki Bella Dean Ambrose Brock Lesnar And cm punk all get mentioned 🤣
Mean while, Cm punk made his debut last night on AEW
Well.. now everybody really knows that Roman is going to win. Such idiots! Raising the steaks? No that’s telling everyone that you’re definitely going to win. I was actually hyped until Roman opened his mouth. I mean there was no reason for WWE to do that. Roman leaving?😂😂🤣 If it was anyone else I would’ve believed it lol
Okay Heyman is a coward...y'all saw how he jumped quickly out of the ring😂😂😂
This is such bad booking  They've let everyone know that Reigns wins with this stipulation. They've also made Cena, a face, look stupid with the arrogance he's displayed. When a face tells everyone that he's going to win, he has to win.  Classic WWE nonsense. Real shame
ROMAN LEAVE WWE, JOIN AEW
Anyone notice the tribal Chad sign at the end of the video
Just dump all the money on Pat's front door please thank you
{سلام عليكم} Peace be upon you
Nar regins ain't losing
The moment roman say "either left stadium as universal champion or left wwe" it's sign he gonna retain championship, this rival is great but it too prediction. We just hope their put great performance match.
Roman going to AEW
Oh please.. if they wanna leave they should say it with their full chest.. it seems they all going to AEW
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙆
1:32 referring to Daniel Bryan and his relase
John Cena Or Roman Reigns?
John gonna fall in line after summerslam
John Cena really is something else on the mic
Pls make cena win wwe i beg u no dont make roman leave wwe
Its gonna be DQ Roman loses, Cena wins and Roman leaves with the belt as he promised
This basically confirms Reigns is gonna win...
Roman going to AEW?
Smackdown in its prime again and cm punk in aew wrestling is prime now
Goodbye Roman!
Cena please 🙏don't disappoint us you are the hope please Cena we trust you just make that 123..... From South Africa 🇿🇦❤♥Cena Cena Cena
Spoiler alert roman wins why make it obvious
Missed a chance to get roman massive heat when he said he smashes people so bad wwe doesnt have a use for them. Shouldve named Strowman, Wyatt and Bryan.
The thing is they spoiled all because it's obvious that Cena is not going to win. Because roman will not leave good job wwe
2 and a half was more like 3 and a half
Of course Michael Cole ruined it with his late count
“He kicked out at 2 and a half but point taken.” 😂😭
I think Cena will win but roman will later come back as a face that has been WWE plan all along to make him the next guy🤔🤔🤔
Is it just me that just knows cena ain't winning?
I could appreciate how WWE is getting better now but still nothing compared to 2004 2005 2006 ERA .
Aew..cm punk
I haven't actively watched WWE in 3 years but I enjoyed this rivalry and will definitely watch their match at SS
Well they just made it official : Roman will retain.
Oh its gonna be a good night
Take a shot everytime John Cena says "1...2...3."
LE MATCH
AEW Fans: cm punk is back….WWE is done now and will go out of business yeah  WWE Fans: LOL
One,
Screw this match.
Summerslam will be the perfect time for Cena to turn heel
Did Roman get new teeth??
Way to go making the result blatantly obvious now. No need to watch 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
123 is hella annoying
Roman seems so ANNOYED.. He's gonna smash cena to pieces. Cena is getting on his nerves
John keeps on emphasizing 1,2,3. He forgot he had a Submission finisher
Plot twist : Roman Reigns lose and leave WWE, then appear at All Out.
At SummerSlam it's gonna be 1... 2... *Guillotine Chock*  *Pass out* 😎
well know we know whos gonna win...
You can see me 🟢🖐🏻🔥
Let's go Cena ❤❤❤
Dam he go leave WWE I don't think Mr.mchman will let this slide
My Roman my best 🥰🥰💪
1.3 million vs 500k. In 7 hours.
GG!
WWE, your actions regarding the return of CM Punk to AEW.....
the rock will return at summerslam..you watch.. one way of another.... lol
reigns sucks
I thought when Roman n his cousins gets the belt they wud be like a shield fraction 🤔 what happened to that??
Moop
Cena will win with Reigns to break record, and then he lost this title one week after cause Big E.
♥👍
And at 2:12 you know who’s going to win 😂😂😂
CM PUNK!
Guess Roman is retaining then. 😂
Cena must turn heel and have a shirt that says 123
That literally just says roman reigns is gonna win
اوفا 80 مليون
This is great ... But cm punk is back 🎉🎉🎉
2:36 Brock Lesnar when he returned he practiced this move against john cena. SummerSlam spoiler?
John cena heel hmmmm🤔
Hmm I wonder who is going to win after that promo
John Cena must win at Summerslam
Wtf classic wwe they spoiled the ending
AEW have brought back the goat 🐐 cm punk. Meanwhile wwe full of hella acting . No action
All you guys forget one man! That is Baron Corbin!!! He will rush to the ring with his "Money in the bank" and get the Universal Champion!!!!!
Now we know john cena lose because roman reigns can t go away from wwe
Cm punks return makes this look like some acting gimmick, boring
Roman should shut up and let Paul Heyman show his micskill.
Man…that segment was awful.
John Cena promo 1 2 3 😒
C'MON ROMAN PLEASE🤧
If Roman loses the championship I might stop watching tbh😂
Imagine if Cena wins and takes the title and that will  really top CM Punk’s return! Wow! Even if Reigns wins, something will happen!
The Tribal chief will win ez
CM PUNK! JON MOXELY AND ROMAN REIGHNS AND DANIEL BRIAN! IF THESE WERE IN AEW then that would be a game changer!
Roman should  lose so that he goes to AEW💀
John Cena is becoming a universal champion once and for all
IS John Cena comme back to WWE 2021 ??
OMG John Cena can count to 3!  That is incredible!!! Promo of the year 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
MMMH OK   I guess Roman's gonna lose, "leave" WWE for a good 3-4 weeks of well deserved vacation, come back and MAYBE turn face since the crowd is back
You cant beat the legend like cena
Finn Balor to cost Cena the title in a heel turn
Yea we all want to see cena win but we know he will lose
Hey Roman, did you hear the joy from Chicago last night? Now go back to your alcoholic cousin,  because we are Straight Edge.  God is back home, in real pro wrestling.
If roman said that if he lose to john cena and he will leave wwe, now i know he is gonna win bcoz john cena pretend to be lose 😂
I trust Roman so if he loses I will never watch wwe again.
Well if it's the case of roman leaving he may aswell join Hollywood like he's cousin or He will win
I'm still pissed off that there wasn't much of a pop for The Brood theme song... THAT GROUP MADE EDGE COME ON GUYS! You have the Network for a reason!!
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Yep Roman reigns is gonna retain he ain't gonna,leave WWE he has to retain
Absolutely NO SHOT Reigns is losing
ROMAN WILL LOSE
وتافاك 🤣🤣🤣
Now the picture is clear . Roman is winning coz I can't imagine the WWE throwing out their megastar
CM PUNK
CM punk is back if anyone is interested in something not made for 7 year old kids..
Joe Anoa i to AEW confirmed
I’m pretty damn sure Finn Balor or Corbin interrupt Cena and Reigns retains the title. Spoiler Alert :D
If he loses he leaves wwe and says hello too aew
If I Lose i will Leave Wwe for aew
cena you talk to much
CM Punk is All Elite
Wouldve  been better if john cena said he would be leaving   Just would be  more valueble imo
U can see Roman reigns Face is Scared when jhon Cena saidd the 2 Times 123
CM Punk is back
This match has become too predictable it's not even funny. There's no way Roman would lose Vince won't make him quit.
Guy that's been champion for almost a year and is a constant saying if he loses to a part timer he'll leave.  Way to spoil the ending.
Roman will win but Big E is gonna cash his MITB contract after the match and will take the title with Cena’s help. I originally had Cena winning the match and Big E cashing on him but given what Roman said about quitting, I’m pretty sure that’s how it’s gonna go down.
The thumbnail looks like it is from a game 🤣
john cena aka the wannabe chinese
Don't know why, but everytime Cena talk, its really annoying 😂 he's trying really hard to become the Rock when it come to promo 🤣
This is same shyt different day stuff. If u want real pro wrestling go watch Cm punk in AEW. He's back
Cm punk!!!
So anyways on the other show a particular best in the world debuted and they had a much better show than this 😂
CM PUNK
Roman loses, he leaves, Cena loses......round 2?
I'd like to see Cena win his 17th but it's not gonna happen. The WWE has pushed Roman to the top and there is no way they are going to let Cena win. No point in paying to see Summer slam cause they ruined it with that promo. Be a waste of money. Wonder how much money Vince and HHH just cost WWE
😂😂😂roman bosta
Roman is gonna have plot armor
CM PUNK!
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK!!!!
Guys CM Punk is back
2:23 NO
100% Lesnar is returning in this match
"Raises the stakes." Aka spoils the outcome.
Very funny promo 🤣 roman was funny he want to do John move
YAWN 🥱
What if the demon king show up 😂
I only hear cm punk cm punk go watch aew
BORING STIPULATION , a giant SPOILER.
This is gonna be one hell of a match hoping Cena wins as my second favourite wrestling
Lol yet aew now has cm punk . Aew runs rings around smack down
meanwhile, punk had made his debut on aew! the wrestling industry is getting hype everywhere!
They burn the result from now 😑
Wwe is nothing without wyatt
john will break rich flair record as the 166 time championship
So let me get this straight...they bring Cena back,so he can become 17 time champion,or they just bring him back so he can retire when he loses?because obviously roman is winning since he can't leave the wwe!or they are just making thr storyline better...cena wins...becomes 17time champ,roman leaves for some time off...then wwe get him back for a rematch where if cena loses he has to retire?anything is possible...but i think bringing back cena is not just to lose to roman...believe that
Confirmed Roman retains because we know he’s not leaving WWE lol
So either they gave the results away already or they have something really interesting in store But knowing wwe...
Awww look everyone! Cena learned how to count to 3! 🤣
And I wanted john to win so much ig roman is winning
I'm tired of duplicating Roman Rings support.  He must be in another championship There are many who deserve it
I don’t want him to leave
Loooool RIP WWE, CM Punk is all elite 😂
It's gonna be either Roman actaully leaving or some kind of interruption from another dude during the match.
No way Roman loses
Guess romans gone for good Falalala flallaa aye aye aye GOODBYE
Everybody knows that roman gonna win 🏆 Vince baby boy roman gonna win.
I laugh how Cena got a title shot and he didn't earn it and people are happy bout it but yet they are pissed when Goldberg or Brock Lesnar get that treatment
CM punk > WWE
Roman reigns have white teeth 🦷  😬
Well thanks WWE, theres now no point watching this match because you've just told us that Reigns is winning. Good job
John Cena 👍👍👍👍👍👍....
well that’s not a prediction that’s a spoiler 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
If Roman Reigns leaves WWE I’m gonna stop watching
Dear WWE. I'm always gonna watch your shows, events, all that you provide. I still believe WWE has the best rosters, but please, listen to your stars, the crowd (WWE universe). You've lost, let go of some major players as of late and it must have some kind of effect. My point is that your audience is slowly getting smaller. Doesn't this bother you? I'd be very concerned a and would try my best to reverse this, cuz I also believe that that "other brand" isn't going to stop taking what was yours and create something bigger.
Well thanks WWE for not letting Cena Break the Record 😒
🤣🤣🤣hi no shade intended on WWE but CM Punk is back guys😛😛🥳🥳♥️♥️
Imagine Roman loses and then signs in with AEW
Voi della Wwe fate schifo ora che roman se perde lascia la wwe è letteralmente impossibile che john lo lasciate vincere è solo questione di maledetti affari potevate anche evitare e lasciargli almeno una settimo a john il diciassettesimo titolo per poi mandarlo via invece no vi ostinate a fargli far gran scena è  poi evitare in qualunque modo di farlo VINCERE NN È GIUSTO!
Did Y'all Know CM Punk Is On AEW Now
Cena's flow is awesome
Well we know Romans winning then
I guess we all watched the return of CM Punk!!
Overshadowed. Curse WWE eternally. Patiently waiting for the day WWE gets 50,000 viewers per week. Grew up watching this stuff and it's really sad to see it reduced to being inferior.
Well. Then we all don't need to watch the main event anymore?
CM PUNK !!!!
And wwe just destryod every thing. now I will never whats it agian. as long as vince is in this wold. Raw I have not whats for a long time. and now i'm will never see smackdown too. Hope Vince soon go away. and never returns
New drinking game whenever cena says 1,2,3 you got to drink 😂
This promo  <  CM Punk AEW debut
I’m already seeing Seth vs Cena feud 🔥, going to be interesting. Universal championship
Cena is very good on the mic 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
But just imagine if cena wins, maybe it's possible just think about this scenario 🤔
What is WWE going to do know with everyone talking about CM punk on AEW
It was already clear roman was gonna win now it is a spoiler
I knew Roman was gonna win, saved myself the Summerslam results. Haha
Cm punk is back who cares abt cena and reigns anymore
So, Roman is going to join Dean, I mean, Moxley in AEW then?!?!?
I want Roman to win this then Cena comes back with the Doctor of Thuganomics and comes up with un pg work and then beats Roman at a payperview id love to see that
The question is NOW ARE U TEAM ROMAN OR TEAM CENA
I can’t believe what John cena is gonna do😱🤩😊
Roll up zone
CM Punk.
Jhon wins reigns attacks him on a promo
Why Give Cena the big return only for him to be squashed then go back into Hollywood???  Makes 0 sense
even cena knows rollup wins you matches
ROMAN IS GONNA RETAIN CUZ HE IS THE YOUNG GUY ON HIS WAY UP
DAM the look on Romans face when we was MAD!!!!!!!!
JOHN DESERVES 17 REIGNS
I think Cena wins but Big E cashes in
Whoever decided to add the retirement stipulation needs to be fired. You made an already predictable result even more so. This is why people are abandoning ship and heading for greener pastures
What happened to Liv Morgan
I thought he would say Cena should put his career in the line.  Then it would have really made the fans think hard about the outcome.  Oh well. Let's just see. Maybe we'll get the shock of the decade.
aew boutta be lit now
Roman reigns still SUCKS at promos. All this time after cena gave him an embarrassing tongue lashing so many years ago and he still cant talk?. Thats sad.  Reigns has no character development, no charisma, no wrestling talent hes perfect for ROH. 😂
May God bless you and bless you both and bring me together🥰🥰❤
I will just say CM PUNK.
The only way for WWE to truly shock the world now is to have Cena winning, otherwise this writing is possibly the most predictable it’s ever been
Roman Reigns will keep winning till he face Seth Rollins
Lowkey want cean to win
CM PUNK
If cena has a sense of humor he should celebrate his 17th world championship with "my time is now" paul Heyman's version
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITEEEEEE!!!!!
Se Roman tirar a barba e raspar o cabelo, ele vira o The Rock
Not worth watching, odds-on a Roman win now
I love how he's made a joke out of "1, 2, 3" 😂😂😂
So its settled reigns will win
Jhon ciiieeeennnaaaa🔥
Does WWE even have a point anymore? They get rid of their best talent like Bray Wyatt, and CM Punk is now on AEW which automatically makes it better than WWE.
Joe Anoai is All Elite
Roman needs time of..
And from there ... Cena loses at Summerslam. A brilliant angle with Cena at his promo-ing best gone in 14 words.
Yeah if it's leaving the WWE...John Cena time is up already i mean what is a bigger match than this... i am gonna miss John Cena so much
That is strtegy
I feel like he is going to go AEW wrestling, why on earth would he make that bet?
Why do WWE always make them dumb stipulations? Now we now Roman will win.
So it's deffo rigged for roman too win
If Roman lose is gonna leave wwe? Reallyyyy?
Leaving and going to AEW so obvious now
i hate spoilers and i got one big spoiler straight into my face - the results of summerslam mainevent..
Romain must beat that Hollywood star Cena up he is  fake
Roman means that.
Cena doesn't even deserve a title match.Also cena criticised the rock for going to Hollywood but cena done the same thing
Roman reigns call the usos
Cena win…. And they bring back Roman,after a few weeks. Simply a good WWE Storyline. They do this so many times in the attitude era. There is always a way back,that no one expected.
Reigns s'il perd il quitte la WWE, il a osé dire ça. Non mais il a péter un plomb la 🤣🤣🤣
Well we know who's winning that one then
OmG CM punk returns to AEW!
Come on John Cena
Roman is going to AEW. He will lose
This to me confirms reigns is gonna win.cuz he ain't leaving
I just want to say: Punk is back in action. Only cena and RKbro keep me here. Hope cena won the tittle
John Cena is a loser.
Oh
If you don't now if Roman Reings quick out and two and a half. Be a ref in your home.
If you make a mistake is 1,2,3 if you get distracted is 1,2,3 me 😂😂😂😂 very interesting ❤❤🇳🇦
Roman your career was been end this summer slam
What a huge spoiler, now we all know Roman is going to win 😂
CM Punk to AEW confirmed!
CM Punk is not WWE
Cm punk just came back and hit over 1 million views!
This is mistake on WWE's part in my opinion!   We all know Roman isn't going anywhere so saying he will leave WWE if he loses pretty much confirms thay he will win before SummerSlam even starts.  If he hadn't said, we would have gone in thinking this really could go either way but I think it's pretty safe to say Roman will be victorious now.
If roman loss ( which he won't) then it means he will take a time off again it's not that he will leave wwe
When i was younger i would've taken in all of Cena's words as truth. However, by his promos its clearly he just wants to champ again. I get that. But for me, i think rather than breaking the record he and Flair share, he should try becoming grand slam champion by winning the IC Title. I mean he has done practically just about everything there is to do in WWE.
WWE has to deliver More. AEW is hot than hot with cm Punk.
Well Roman is winning at summer slam thanks WWE
So its official roman winning
Wwe is gonna be done for soon. Since cm punk is all elite now. Only thing they could really do is pg 13 this thing or give up lmaoo honestly
Cena never new who he was playing with 😂😂😂, Reigns is unstoppable 🔥🔥💪
wonder if wwe gave cena a stimulation as well
And do the whole 9 reference to fast 9 😂😂
John sena winnn
John Cena knows how to make Roman lose character.
roman shut win the match now roman is unstopble in whole wwe
If all he needs is 1, 2, 3, what's stopping him from turning to illegal tactics?  It would make sense honestly (his desperation to become the G.O.A.T., coupled with his "hatred" for Roman & [from a business perspective] get more eyes on WWE).  Could you imagine if Cena turned heel to win his 17th World Championship? Wrestling fans worldwide would have orgasms.  A CM Punk return AND a John Cena heel turn: two things that we never thought would happen (happening all at once).
Pat is literally one of the best things on smackdown right now😂 Also can’t wait for the Roman and cena match (The ultimate heel vs the ultimate face)
Roman will lose and go film a movie with the rock
Cena champ is here ❤️❤️
It’s obvious roman is gonna win after he said i’ll leave wwe
The Best In The World Is All Elite!. CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK!!!...
Roman reigns will retain the tittle
ROMAN kicked out of 2
Roman reigns don't quiet
123
Bring cm punk here
Confirmed. Joe Anoaii is All Elite 🤣🤣🤣
If John Cena wins Roman is going aew
Please don’t go
İ ilke john cena
PLEASE WWE ANYONE THERE AM FROM KENYA AND WOULD LIKE TO BE AUDITIONED TO JOIN THE  WWE BRAND. ANYONE THERE AND EVEN THE WWE FANS HELP ME CONNECT TO WWE. THANK YOU
Cena and goldberg wrestling at summerslam CM punk returning to AEW. What year are we in?
Cena roll-up and Roman takes a break until the Rumble and build the fued for Rock v Roman
Comedy at its finest!
WE ALL KNOW WHOS WINNING NOW LMAO
It would be a shame if Cena didn't win after all of his great talking. But I guess after saying "I'm leaving WWE." They'll make Roman win.
Wwe why would you reveal who wins before the match the 'i win or i leave wwe' stake is a spoiler because theres no way roman reigns is going to leave
Roman will retain his universal champion at summerslam
so 99% of me sees roman winning but 1% sees cena winning because putting roman over twice?
Meanwhile, CM PUNK is on AEW 😆😆
Cena wins big E cashes in and nobody leaves. Yawn.
Team Roman...
If roman doesn't survive his done  and  he did it to himself.
roman leave wwe, go to aew pls
Why is John running his mouth making as a failure
Someone will attack John and reigns will retain the title
Well it was nice thinking Cena might win for a while - no chance now!!
Well, this match is spoiled, we all know that Cena's comeback is till Summerslam, and now Romen will leave if he loses? That's assuring the match result. Well, Tony khan was right when he said we don't treat people as idiots.
Imagine this becomes a Brock vs John summer slam part 2,it would make sense for it to happen now that romans turned heel
He taking pretty spicy he better win
Hello ! Cm punk is back
It’s all about cm punk on aew
I’m starting to think that roman will beat john cena with a roll up.
Team cena 👌
"1, 2, 3" is Cena's new catchphrase
I guess this destroys all my worries of Reigns losing this. He aint leaving WWE.
If Roman reigns leaves I don’t know what I’m going to do
Boring as hell. CM is in AEW btw.
Well that basically told us whos gonna win lol; plus i dont think theyd let John make history and Pass Ric Flair while being part time.
1 ,2 ,3  prrrrrrrr tunturuntu tunturuntu
punk should learn from Cena how to make a promo
Congratulations WWE you just spoiled your own Summerslam main event
i am never going to watch wwe again if romen lost at summer slam
Oldberg and cena, dig out more oldies instead of trying and finding new talent to push.throw away good decent talent and push these old timers .wwe you are on your arse
Roman reigns is not leaving WWE yet. His going home with his title
If they make Cena lose 💔🥲
AEW : CM PUNK IS BACK  WWE : NEED UNDERTAKER/THEROCK/TRIPLEH/STONECOLD/JHONCENA
CM Punk

CM PUNK. CM PUNK. CM PUNK
2:25 Tony Khan wakes up
Welp Roman is winning; guaranteed now. Unless they pull some dq shenanigans like with every tough contender Roman has to face.
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE!!!
Cm punk to aew confirmed .😉
For sure. Wwe creative team ask Michael Cole to count 1 2 3 on that segment. But Cole make a botch haha. Luckly, pat make a joke to save it hahaha. Pat really good as commentary. Make smack down interesting.
Do I smell somethng like.. "Roman Reigns is all elite" ? lmao
CM PUNK BACK ALL ELİTE WRESTLİNG
A quien más le salio un anuncio de la WWE en el comienzo del video
I can't watch this anymore thinking about cm punk😂
WWE and AEW fans stay united
Great promo from the B company this week
Who cares cm punk is back 🤔
The 123 is getting on my nerves
Stop pushing the universal title so hard jesus, it was created like yesterday and has no prestige. And now we're pretending it's a world title?
As it wasn't predictable enough, this stipulation is really useless.
I can't wait this much
Roman reigns will win
Roman just pulled a Brock Lesnar line "either I leave champion or I'm walking" 😂
John Cena is so 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Roman better win. There's no way he's leaving WWE. Especially after Bray Wyatt.
Sigh… out of everything that could have possibly “raised the stakes” you decide to make Roman retire if he loses… ik in kayfabe the stakes are high but lets be real guys this match up went from 100 to 0 after this promo because now the winner is pretty much confirmed at this point
CM Punk is All Elite Wrestler 🥲 finally...
I'm afraid this going to be passing of the torch. Roman Reigns will win somehow even it could controversial.
CM Suck
Damm now I know Roman is going to win
Yeahh.. so wwe just confirmed that roman will win there is no way he is going to quit 🤦🏼‍♂️
Roman u better not leave WWE please, everyone need u..
Wwe need to bring their game up cuz right now AEW is coming up
ايش وضعه رومان 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CM punk is back AEW💪💪💪💪
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Roman Reigns to AEW confirmed
lol..now it’s predictable
Bravo Roman
Who is still watching these clowns........Cm punk is lit on AEW.
If roman leaves wwe is gonna be different and if he does ima go to aew cus of punk
Untill now cm punk video made 1,1m and cena+roman video made 407k
Damn it so Roman Winning
CM Punk!!!! 🤙
1   2    3   john   cena  and   noman   reigns   was  the  you  all   can   good   from
No me entero de nada no hablo inglés
We all know roman is now going to win.. it's 100% chance that Roman reigns is going to beat John Cena....  Another reason for us not to watch this Sunday....  Unless John Cena turns HEEL theres No chance in hell John Cena wins......
So reigns is going to win
The champ is here lets go cena
Michael Cole should always shut up during Roman's entrance and let Pat McAfee give him the praise
This is why John Cena is lit bro I don't care about haters
Cm punk!
Well….Still the UV champion Roman Reigns🤌
Cena is the one with too much ego. He should be losing, couse he doesnt deserve to win
John cena
JOHN CENA
Roman Reigns All Elite ;) and Seth. ;)
Well I'm here because CM Punk is  back
* Me reading the comments while the video is playing *: Why is everybody tripping, this is definitely a 50/50😑  * Me getting to that part they're all talking about * : Well there goes all my anticipation that's been built up 😒
407k views 😂😂😂 wwe is a joke already if not for cena there will be no 407k yeh heyy vince happy cmpunk day
A certain person has returned to wrestling if anyone’s noticed 👀
John cena you know that Roman Can crack your head
Summerslam roman wins...        Spoiler
But what if Big E or Homeless Corbin cashes in on the Tribal Chief and win the title?  Remember the stipulation. If he ain't walking outta Vegas with the title, he's walking out of the company.
The wrestling world is crazy and it crazy cm punk return john cena and a heel roman reigns just imagine if raw was good
CM PUNK is backkkkkkkk
We all know who’s winning now. Because their no chance in hell Vince letting Roman go 😂😂
imagine roman lost and he join aew. roman vs punk 🔥
Aew aew cm punk  Who cares about wwe
Seems like everyone is jumping ship to AEW
Roman reigns to hollywood confirmed
Why i dont see any comment of CM punk at AEW?
am not here to promote movies but 1,2,3
Roman taking some time off
So yeah, basically "Heel" Cena becoming CM Punk in this story. Either Cena gonna makes Roman quits (temporarely, or scriptly) and comeback at WM, or this SummerSlam gonna be like "RAW after Royal Rumble" between Punk & Cena (against The Rock in that storyline)
Ignore the fact that this video has less views than Cm return on aew
Mark my words either brock lesnar or bray wyatt return in summerslam,
Roman: If I lose the Universal Championship, then I'm leaving WWE. Woah. That escalated quickly.
Reigns pls don't leave
We want fired fired bruce prichard !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AEW
Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk
AEW is starting to look like it could become a very dangerous threat to WWE as the #1 wrestling company.
Who will win?
Roman is winning. He just Announced it.
"I smash them so bad wwe doesn't have a use for them no more." One way to reference Wyatt and Bryan before they're in AEW
Roman Reigns to AEW cobfirmed?
CM Punk is in AEW,   John Cena vs Roman Reigns oh man it's a good time to be a wrestling fan,  RK-Bro is a thing lol i love it
This story telling is soooo bad. Cena maybe had a chance, could have actually had some character growth. But no, they went for this garbage. It's so disappointing.
So we know romans going over. Good to know.
Roman added that stake so he can throw the match and get out of the company lol he knows wwe are screwed especially now aew have cm punk.
Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk
Cm punk
The whole angle of Roman leaving WWE was completely unnecessary and actually took away from the feud.
This match was unpredictable, now Roman made it predictable, but maybe they could uno reverse things
Paul Heyman left his job to do the Pin co'z it was John Cena 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥💦💦💦
aew
This promo single handedly kills this match, Roman wins now. Was kinda hoping Roman would lose it to change the story a bit till they need to start is fued with the rock later
Roman ran the Fiend to back to Raw, Roman ran Daniel Bryan outta WWE, Roman is gonna send Cena back to Hollywood!
Cena go home you no longer exciting
Without John cena, rkbro, KO and Seth and the mysterios and the women’s division wwe will lose for good against aew can somebody tell Vincent Hunter needs to come back to save the company once again
CM Punk is in AEW. Brian Danielson is next.
funny no said CM PUNK lol
The most devastating move in ALL of pro wrestling 🤼‍♀️
"I'm back"  - Someone of Chicago.
Cm Punk Cm Punk Cm Punk
Aaaaaaaaaaand any vague possibility of Cena winning was just removed.
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE!!!!
AEW Crowd was louder
wait Roman wins
Come on AEW vs WWE Suvivor series?
So this means Roman is definitely going to win lol
Who cares?  CM Punk is back!
1,2 oldu yalaci jhon cena
Great. Now there's no way Cena is winning at Summerslam. As much as I want Cena to win, I don't think WWE is stupid enough to let go of Roman Reigns.
thanks for killing the intrigue. Same as HHH vs Batista and WM.
AEW Has CM Punk! What Are U Gonna Do Now?
It's done... Roman saying leaving wwe is just another clue of proving he wil retain his championship..& cena wil lose...
Well done WWE. Just gave Away Your biggest match.
Great video
Roman reigns in aew
If Cena wins he has Punk to thank.
ok roman is going to win it
Roman going to win do yall really think Roman leaving wwe
Imagine if Roman loses, leaves WWE, joins AEW and enters in a feud with CM Punk.... Damn!
Thats how we know cena is losing 🙄
Hahah
Reigns leaves wwe if he loses his title ?! That's what lesnar did
Cm punk
Kick him John
Wwe let him in 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
If Roman really leave WWE and go to others brand... I will stop watching wwe anymore
WWE are screwed! I’m not an Aew fan. I’m a wrestling fan. And Aew just received the missing piece of puzzle last night. They were competitive before but now WWE really have to do something drastic to remain the number one wrestling company because they’ve gone really state this past 18 months.
You should record the sumerslam roman reigns vs John cena match live
So Reigns is 100% winning now right? It was 90% before but that stake just kinda seals it. The promo work was good at least but you ain’t topping Chicago
They are making it too obvious that Cena will lose
So Roman will be victorious
So are you're John cena is my favorite always good wwe love wrestling right now
I bet roman win it
Amazing see The Champ John Cena face to face against The Triple Cift Universal Champion Roman Reings in this is amazing segment on SmackDown i like soo much see this is two amazing athletes face to face on SmackDown before SummerSlam and this is segment on SmackDown is awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 i can't wait to see this is match tonight at SummerSlam for The Universal Championship between The Triple Cift The Universal Champion Roman Reings vs The Champ John Cena this is match become epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Roman Says "or I leave WWE", I think Roman will win at Summerslam.
Reigns smile is everything
So if Roman loses he leaves WWE hahahaha I think Reigns will retain his championship unless he has to go to Hollywood to make a movie
Well at least Roman wins
Well....... WWE have officially lowered the stakes of the summerslam main event, but spoiling the outcome 😕🙄now we truly know Reigns is gonna Retain the title, I'm no longer excited now
I just want cena to win
CM PUNK
The champ is cena
I hope  cena wins
welp now we know roman def gonna win smh🥲
This 1, 2, 3 bs is kinda bad.
Reigns will win. C'mon. Wwe won't push an angle like that where Reigns will leave.
Dude wow
Well although i think roman is gonna retain but cena can still win because if you guys remember what happened between Cena and Punk after moneh in the bank. So there is a possibility though. That's my opinion
Talk talk talk... BORIIIIING
SUMMER OF PUNK BABEEEE
CM PUNK IS AEW
Well Romans winning after that but to me John Cena will always be the real head of the table
Man WWE storylines are very outdated
Who else saw cm punk return to aew
The person who is reading this, I wish you a calm, successful, and healthy life forever ❤
Cena just need a 123 count then win the championship and reigns leaves wwe maybe join AEW
I do not care what happens. I just want Cena to win. Even though it is pretty much guaranteed by this point that Reigns will win.
I very sure Roman requested to leave wwe
Roman Reigns is The Perfect King of WWE the Tribal Chief The Head of the Table and Surpass Hulk Hogan and John Cena
CM Punk is back!!!
week roman r
Such a dumb thing to add to the match. Jesus WWE, can you make it any more predictable?
Guys why you still here? Go watch AEW cm punk is back!!!
Let’s hijack summer slam and all wwe shows from now on with CM Punk chants!!
Tonight Roman Reigns will DETHRONE John Cena and Rhea Ripley will DETHRONE Charlotte Flair
Reigns vs Cena  Punk returning  Edge vs Rollins  Walter defending that UK strap   What an iconic weekend for wrestling

I smell "i quit match"this time
Wait wait, please take time to read this Good news for you. 🤗❤️🙏  God's design for us is to be in a perfect relationship with Him. His plan is one of freedom, meaning, and purpose. He created and loved us. And He wants to give what is good for us.  But we prefer to disobey God's command and design. We have broken His law and we have sinned against Him. Because of our sin, we are forever separated from the presence of God, leaving us broken and empty.  But God, out of His mercy and love, because he knew we could not save ourselves, He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, as the solution to our problem with sin. Jesus lived the perfect life that we could never live. And his life became the payment for our sins. He was crucified and rose again.  Because of Jesus' death and resurrection, we are no longer separated from God. Because Jesus is the only way to reconcile our relationship with God. He is the only WAY. And only Jesus can complete our need for freedom, meaning and purpose.  For us to have true freedom, we must admit that we are sinners; we need God’s forgiveness only through the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Only then can we live fulfilled and joyful lives. Jesus changed everything for us. Forever. Godbless Everyone ❤️🙏❤️❤️
why is roman just standing in the ring alone?
it wasn't  3 michel Cole  , it was 2 and half
20% of Comments about Roman And Cena And 80% Comments about CM Punk debuting on AEW
Roman Reigns will win and Rhea Ripley will win
Man it's great to be a wrestling fan right now with AEW and WWE and Impact
I don’t know if Reings was looking around relieved he didn’t get and AA or pissed because he was embarrassed in that missionary position down by John 😂😂😂
no way roman gonna lose when putting career on the line
The whole wrestling world is talking about Punk tonight. But Roman says he’s not over?  Roman Reigns will never ever in his life get a pop like the one Punk got in 2011 or the one tonight in 2021.
Vinny and hhh! Congratulations! You done effed up big time! CM Punk in AEW! That is what happens for being selfish and unappreciative! GREAT JOB!🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I just wondered why Cm Punk never mention WWE when he return at AEW instead mention ROH, btw happy to see him back.
We all know reigns will win... Its very obvious
CM Punk! CM Punk! CM Punk!
John ceno pls bring Mestrey and his son in case this Mad Dogs  cousins will be around they ar Bustes they spoil't match G.Luck J.Ceno
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE
AEW's Punk arrival > WWE's Lashley vs Goldberg + Cena vs Roman
John Cena does Missionary position  1. 2. 3. Pumps
That count thing is so cheesy,really tho why not Finn Balor,I would've actually watched a reigns vs Balor
Good thing i wont miss Roman Reigns But all it will take is 1 2 3
WWE: how are you gonna compete with CM Punk goin to AEW?  Also WWE: If Roman loses he's leaving the WWE lmao  Fans: thanks for making it obvious roman is winning lol
If Cena wins I’m done
Just like that this feud was ruined. Only wwe can screw up something like this after that promo battle they had last week.
Cena and Roman are overrated!!!
Shut up cm punk is back!!
Cm Punk is back, but not in WWE
Please for the love of god wwe, make your matches more professional, give everyone non-scripted promos because THAT is wrestling entertainment.
I wonder who will win now
Well they’re screwed now that cm punk is at aew now
Soooooo.....Roman retaining confirmed?
BEST IN THE WORRLLLLLLDDDDD HIS RETURN VIDEO ALMOST AT 1MILL VIEWS ALREADY AND ITS BEEN 4 HRS SINCE ITS BEEN UP LOL
I like this Roman
AEW AEW AEW
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
I love you PAT😂
wwe John cena
Can't wait till tomorrow. 🔥🔥🔥
Now I'm REALLY worried for Bobby Lashley & Roman kicked at 2.
CM Punk is backkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Keep in mind Mandy's former partner Sonya Deville had a very similar stipulation last year which involved her leaving the WWE when she lost her grudge match... and then coming back as one of the general managers. I'm thinking this might be a set up for Roman to make Cena's life a living hell as an administrator rather than a wrestler.   Or, more likely, this is just to add some drama because Cena's acting career is doing very well right now and there's really no point in him coming back to WWE, winning the title, and probably dropping it almost immediately so he can do another movie. Cena is NOT Hulk Hogan, who had an ego so huge he wormed himself into winning Wrestlemania 9 despite everyone knowing he was leaving for Hollywood soon after.
Roman just spoiled it Cena will not win!!!
Now I know that romans gonna win cause no way wwe are getting rid of Roman
Did you heard Mad Dog and make sure you don't bring Stupid Cousins to"t Ring to help you if they help you ar always  a Looser so Remember🐺
Really?! Even john cena is doing roll ups now?????
Oh so he’s basically winning 🗿
Well that's lame. We all know Roman isn't losing now lol
How can you get mad at Smackdown right now?! Pat McAfee is 🔥 behind the booth, Edge killing the promo game, Roman Reigns lighting up the main event scene and his overall game, Bianca Belair is on a roll each week.. The stakes for the SummerSlam main event can’t get ANY higher!!
John Cena will lose go back Hollywood just like Brock Lesnar beat the rock went back to Hollywood
Uwielbiam John Cena
Sorry Reins John Is a Living Legend who is better than you he never has had no one ever aide him like your cousins or Seth although I hope the mysterios and or edge are near by with a steel chair to assist John if your cousins interfere .
Cm punk
Damn it. Roman is going to retain it.
John Cena how many tyms u have acknowledged the big dog 🐶 the head of the table  u will still acknowledged  the big dog coz u will never be tired
WTF THE BIG DOGG AND CENA TO AEW 🤯🤯🤯😆😆😆🤔🤔🤔🤓🤓🤓🤫🤫🤫😎😎😎👍👍👍
CM Punk with his debut on AEW stole the Friday Night Wars tonight 😉
Well Roman is confirmed to win now 😂
Roman Reigns is gonna win cos I don't think WWE will actually want him to leave
John cena🤣🤣
CM Punk
I honestly feel so bad for the WWE talent tomorrow. I'm sure today was bittersweet for them, an amazing moment for all of proffesional wrestling with Punk's return, but just knowing that whatever they do, no matter how good of a spectacle they put on, nothing can make a memory quite like today.
Roman loses he’s gonna go aew I bet
And still universal champion roman reigns..
With this stipulation, WWE has just ruined summerslam's main event, the result was uncertain until now. Roman retains for sure.
I hope roman reigns retain it so he won't leave
Anyone else think that spoiled the finish and kinda brought the hype down a lil?
John can’t even do 1,2,3 🤌🏼 Roman to win
THE MOST DEVESTATING MOVE IN ALL OF SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT...the surprise roll-up.
I want cena to win but it just isn’t happening
To whoever is reading this Jesus is coming soon repent and turn away from your sins before its too late
Wwe will lose lots and lots of fans if John wins the title  With aew having cm pink viewership will drop massively for wwe
Well, Roman win for sure... There is no way Roman leave WWE.... At least don't make it predictable 😤
Well we all know what that means now Roman Reigns said he leave Wwe if we loses but now we all know we ain't leaving because the winner in Roman Reigns it's obvious now
wait if rising stakes, does that mean John Cena if he loses he is the one retiring? well if it is the case, Cena will be back to hollywood, i guess
If Reigns loses n goes to Aew I wouldn't mind that because I sent mr McMahon a million emails told him to add n adopt Seth Rollins to bloodline. Honestly Tony Kahn would be more interested in Shield Reunions then Vince McMahon. Aew. Would give us Iron Sharpens. Iron. Reunion Jon Moxley n Roman Reigns. I like that better than this stupid smackdown with no Shield wwe sucks. Tf for total failure wwe sucks bro.
Cena leader of WWE as universal champion and cm punk leader of AEW
⭐ Cm punk ⭐
1:39 Roman:  ....wwe have no use for them Aew: THATS FREE REAL ESTATE
Bigg dogg done pinned Cena @ no mercy back then. Come now cena go back to Hollywood Big Dogg at his prime...
Okay now we know, Roman will win SummerSlam
CM Punk & Leo Messi made History 🔥🔥🔥
CENA 17 WORLD CHAMPION AT SUMMERSLAM
Basically roman will win after saying he would leave, because John cena can come and go whenever he likes, but I want cena to win
Well now romans sure to win it kinda killed the suspense
I love The Shield more idc wat haters think.
How to🤫🤔😷💸Up, ratings for summerslam, and break the internet like cm punk did, for aew. ▪︎cena/reigns match, big e cash-in ! ▪︎corbin run-in, being hired by reigns for cash. ▪︎brock lesnar returns as face vs heel reigns !
Boring
CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk
So obviously Cena will lose with that stipulation
Sadly, John has gone down hill, Roman should have shut him up faster all I heard was blah blah 1 2 3, blah blah 1 2 3. Sorry John, don't care if Roman wins or Loses his my favourite now. You have got to big of a ego and we all know why you came back, Vince got desperate and you weren't a DC super hero you were a bad guy and trying to get the Dwayne credit.
CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
this runied everything
I think we will see an interruption from corbin
Anytime they make decisions like this “I’ll quit, I’ll leave wwe, I’ll retire” it takes everything out of the match because you know wins going to win now no matter what. Before this you were sure if wwe was going to have Roman win and become a better chief or lose and become closer with his family working will them to become champ again. No now it’s Roman wins no matter what. So either A Roman wins far or B Usos/someone come out to help ensure Roman wins. But outcome will be the same. Roman is going to beat Cena. Thanks for ruining another story WWE. Hell maybe cena will go to AEW now. Over the last 5 years WWE has gone down hill in the worse ways.
Roman should dominate him Brock style very one sided
Cena ❤️❤️
CM PUNK, CM PUNK, CM PUNK.
Well, it’s official, Reigns is retaining
Cm Punk is elite
Tomorrow impossible will be possible 😂
Yay for an unnecessary stipulation the day before the show???
Any one else waiting for the epic booooring booorring booooring when reigns is in the ring....
Honestly, WWE. On the night C.M Punk returns to your opposition, you spoil the ending of Summerslam's Main-Event with a ridiculous stipulation?  What is wrong with this company?
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that I post a video of me screaming like a maniac at games every other week.
You can see moe
If Cena wins, roman has to leave WWE
Guys what are you doing here? Cm Punk is all elite
AEW is gonna make so much more money and no one is going to care about WWE much longer because Vince in case you haven’t heard THE BEST IN THE WORLD is now YOUR competition
nobody care , cm punk returned
CM PUNK!
This is why WWE is losing they end a 2 hour show with talking and AEW ends with an amazing WRESTLING match
انتبه تخسر سينا
I guess that Roman Reigns beat john cena
17th time world champion
I think WWE will not allow Cena to win this bcuz Cena i almost a retired guy and Roman has to be in WWE
Roman could lose because I smell a swerve.
I don't think people understand the backlash Cena would get if he does beat Flair's record
Imagine If Roman Reigns loses and quits, then he signs up with AEW
Cm punk is aew rampage Vince McMahon 😘
Roman don’t leave wwe
Huh now they literally just predicted that roman is gonna win? Why tf wwe
Mientras John cena hace paquetitos ...CM punk un AEW
Hobbs Cousin vs Toretto?? 🤔🤔
😂😂😂😂1-2…….3😅😅😃veggie
CM Punk is AEW!!!!🔥🔥🔥 Today nobody cares about WWE and SmackDown. The only cares today is the return of The Best in the World
I used to like wwe but now I prefer aew!!
I had a hope that cena gonna beat Roman until watched this video. Wwe won’t let cena win the title
He didn't kick out Cena let him up
This just lets you know Roman will win tho there’s no way he’s leaving wwe
CM punk
So Roman to retain then. I'm glad. In an ideal world I would have Cena win at summerslam to break the record and then Roman win it back on smackdown next week
Who's here after cm punk debut on aew
Cm Punk
It’s been so long since WWE had multiple things I’ve wanted to see. Edge Rollins, Cena Reigns, Bianca Banks. Good for them
John Cena and Roman Reigns both are greatest of all time it was going to be biggest main event in wwe
This is an unnecessary giveaway. Why did creative had to let Roman say that? That's almost like a spoiler in my opinion. However, I would let Cena win and become the record breaker and let Mr Money in the bank cash in to become new universal champ.
no point watching now lol we already knew the results. John Cena sent packing in another failed to attempt to get Reins over
Hahahhaah it's grear John Cena🤣
Oh boy table reign is retaining the title because wwe cant afford for the table to leave
Shut up Cena
PSA Roman is winning 🙄
Bookers dream Cena wins Tommorow Roman returns Wins the rumble Cena vs roman 3 at mania
Table reign is talking to a float hat a  jhorts
Noe it all became clear that roman retains
Uhhh all this does is guarantees that roman reigns is winning.......
this feud is great but i think i can give credits to rollins vs edge they have so much on going that feud  standout the most
now all wrestling fans are happy both wwe and aew making fans happy no need to compare whos better or higher rating important is they provide us great entertainment
I don’t even think that Roman Reigns is gonna leave WWE
Ok…Cena win the title, Reigns leave wwe  during 6 months and return for take the title to Big E. IT IS WRITTEN !
David Otunga's wife is in a movie about the singer that sang america the beautiful at wrestlemania 3 and 23.  It would be a nice tribute to Aretha for Jennifer Hudson to open SummerSlam with America the Beautiful and promote the Respect movie at the same time.
CM PUNK!
Hmmmm
ghét jonh cena
*SummerSlam 2020: Roman returns to WWE*  *SummerSlam 2021: Roman leaves WWE*
Guys cm punk is back No more wwe
As of today, WWE has lost to AEW.
How the hell do people watch wrestling everything about it is fake 😂😂
I hope roman win
If Roman lose I will never watch wwe again..
AEW is so high right with CM PUBK returning. But demn, this segment is so funny!
Plis in italy
Roman is gay
I wanna see a Heel Cena run, Going full NWO.
Yeah they made it so obvious that roman will win its crazy
Lol thanks Roman for basically telling us that  your going to win , also no way will wwe let any one beat flairs record any way so the finish was set ,   They finally get Roman to a place of this is an amazing character  we all can watch and enjoy , to cena coming back and  in a 3 min promo making Roman look like a kindergarten child trying to say his abc in front of the class ,  and failing to be able to do so ,
there is also a possibility that john cena would lose kayfabe leave wwe and return as a heel
This build sucks.
What a moment to be a wrestling fan. Unless you're Vince though LMAO
I think they’re pushing Cena winning to hard now that it’s to good to be true.
Thanx for the spoiler mxxm
That "or I'm leaving wwe" took out all the excitement. Unnecessary stipulation.
Ok well Cena's losing guys be prepared
*PLOT TWIST* : Baron Corbin becomes universal champion cashing in big E's contract
Hahahahahhahahahahahah
Reigns loses and returns at Survivor series to confront The Rock on Rocks 25th anniversary
Bro it’s a rap for Roman reigns at summer slam I can’t wait for cena to win
Match outcome, Baron Cobin will cost Cena the match and Roman Retains the title
Cm punk.
Who cares, CM PUNK is back
Damn, didnt know X-Pac is gonna fight Roman at Summerslam, he looks different tho
Wwe just spoiled the entire match by saying roman will leave if he doesn't win we all know they need roman way too much to get rid of him like that this is literally a pass the torch match
I thought John Cena was done in WWE
This clearly means Roman has something he has to do for a little while and being in wwe would get in the way of that Too bad I'm gonna love John Cena has the champ but also gonna miss the hell of reigns
Dai jonh
Amazing time to be a wrestling Fan 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CM PUNK!
Also, their promos are fireeee
John Cena is not going to win
Will Big E cash in???
1:52 - hahahaha. That facial expression though.
This was just a spoiler for the heel winning at the PPV. Just makes it more predictable than Brock Lesnar vs James Ellsworth
This is all nothing, because CM Punk debuts in AEW.
Brooooo....John Cena is soo good!!! See the fear in Roman's eyes from Cena's roll up And he is too good, I think he is going to lose
Roman is probably gonna go to AEW if he loses
Now that Roman Reigns said that he'll leave the WWE if he loses, I'm gonna root for Roman now. I honestly don't want him to leave 🥺😢
CM Punk is back!
Roman: It's either I'm leaving that stadium as the Universal Champion, or I'm leaving the WWE  Me: if that's the case do you think there will be a T-shirt that says, Wreck me and I'll Leave WWE (then on the back) Crying like a Big Baby
Roman ain't gonna loose Roman is doing well. Roman is winning now unfortunately
Reigns is Done!!!!......Goodbye! Don't ComeBack!!!
Well Roman was in hobbs and shaw that one time
We already know that Roman will win, nothing new.
Any time a heel threatens to quit WWE if they lose, they win lol
If i were roman i would point out the rock vs cena where cena clowned rock for being a movie star but now he is one. Therefore he must hate himself.
WWE made a big big big mistake Because CM Punk  in AEW and Because CM Punk  in AEW WWE will lose Chicago Wrestling fans  I LOVE WWE   But WWE Must stop fire superstar   adam cole if lose him will be a lot demage
AEW - CM Punk
F Cena. Roman should Bury this dude
Wow Roman Reigns leaves WWE
john cena promo is one of the best in wrestling
Since they raise the stake we all know now roman is  going to win cause they ain't having someone who is going to leave when summerslam is over
I feel Summer Slam is gonna get hijacked by CM Punk chants tomorrow
K Roman spoiled the prediction
Don’t think cena will be 17x champion   Vince won’t let that happen
We also need randy, rock and Brock.
Roman has a point. He has reached that level of popularity where he could try his hand at acting in movies. I never doubt a wrastlers ability to act because that's what they do.
Don’t care CMpunk is back BAY BAY
Is this what Roman reigns is going to say every time he could lose, I don’t believe what Roman reigns says about leaving WWE on live TV, he wouldn’t leave WWE, they wouldn’t let him!
A while later into the Six Man Over The Top Rope Battle Royale for the SmackDown exclusive Universal Championship between the Demon King, Finn Balor, the Rated R Superstar, Edge, the Savior of SmackDown, Seth Rollins, the Cenation Leader, John Cena, the Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns and the One Winged Angel, Prince Sephiroth at SummerSlam 2021... Michael Cole: We're back here at SummerSlam with our Six Man Over The Top Rope Battle Royale for the SmackDown exclusive Universal Championship. There you see, the current SmackDown Universal Champion, the One Winged Angel, Prince Sephiroth maintaining control of the match. Pat McAfee: Yeah. The One Winged Angel has not allowed either of his opponents to make any moves in this match. Michael: Sephiroth leads with 2 eliminations. He eliminated Edge and Bálor earlier on so now, it's down between him, Cena, Rollins and Reigns. It's just a matter of who wants it more. Pat: Think about what Roman Reigns said last night on SmackDown, either he leaves with the SmackDown Universal Championship or he leaves WWE. Michael: You can bet that Sephiroth's currently doing everything in his power to prevent the former and ensure that the latter becomes reality. Prince Sephiroth: *pants, coughs and groans in pain* (wipes the sweat from his brow.) *takes a deep breath* Okay, Sephiroth. You can do this. Three more eliminations and you'll have ensured that your reign as SmackDown Universal Champion survives. Alright. Here goes nothing. There's absolutely no sense for me to hold anything back now.  Pat: Oh, I think the One Winged Angel's done playing. Sephiroth: I know that if I do this, there'll be no turning back. Michael: Prince Sephiroth with a Triple One Winged Angel. Sephiroth: (hits all three men with the One Winged Angel, grabs the unconscious bodies of the Cenation Leader and the Savior of SmackDown and tosses them over the top rope for their eliminations.) Michael: Both Cena and Rollins are eliminated. It's now down between the Tribal Chief and the One Winged Angel.  Sephiroth: (to the Tribal Chief.) So, this is what it's come down to. I now have the chance to take the reigns of the Tribal Chief from him. (grabs his unconscious body and tosses him over the top rope for the final elimination.) Checkmate. Referee: (motions for the bell.) Ring the bell. *bell rings, signaling the match's end, Advent- One Winged Angel entrance theme plays in the background* Michael: Roman Reigns eliminated! Prince Sephiroth retains the SmackDown Universal Championship. Pat: A new Tribal Chief has just been crowned. Greg Hamilton: Here's your winner and still SmackDown Universal Champion, the One Winged Angel, Prince Sephiroth. Referee: (awards him the SmackDown exclusive Universal, Intercontinental and Raw Tag Team Championships and raises his hand in the air.) Sephiroth: (takes all three championships from the referee, retrieves and puts his black armored coat back on and grabs his sword, Masamune.) Michael: Well, I guess that's the end of the road for Roman Reigns. Pat: I guess Las Vegas, Nevada will forever be known as the last city Roman Reigns ever wrestled in at the heart of SmackDown. Indi Hartwell: (runs out to the ring with his servant, Rick Boogs and embraces the One Winged Angel as he returns her embrace.) Michael: Oh, look at this. Sephiroth's love interest, NXT's Indi Hartwell as well as his servant, Rick Boogs to celebrate. Rick Boogs: *plays his guitar along to the entrance theme* Indi: Sephiroth, you killed it. Rick and I saw the whole thing. I can't believe you ousted one of your adoptive Shield uncles. Sephiroth: Oh, that was merely child's play at best, my love. I mean, all 5 individuals gave me a little bit more than I originally bargained for.
That stipulation by Roman Reigns pretty much confirms that he's retaining at SummerSlam. WWE did not need to put that in cause it now goes from "there's a slight chance Cena could win to, there's no chance in hell he's winning"
Ok Roman Reigns it’s going to win because what he say, if he lost leaving WWE it’s sure he win so at this point doesen’t have sense watch summerslam, Goldberg lost too for sure, because i hope in a John Cena wins
This goes one way or the other. Either Cena wins and makes most of the audience happy, or Roman wins and Vince is happy.
Here is your winner, and still the WWE universal champion, Roman Reigns...
Since roman say he will leave wwe if he didn't win that mean 2 thing either stupid uso ruin the match Or some random dude ruin the match
Cm punk debut at AEW 😮😮
i like that wwe made a joke of their overuse of the surprise roll up but still, Cena aint winning, no way would they let Roman leave, and if Cena does win Roman very clearly is not leaving. Which sucks because im pretty sick of seeing Roman as champion at this point. Hes doing a good job dont get me wrong
Yea yea! Keep him as your champ for the rest of WWE!  CM PUNK IS BACK YOU MF'S.
AEW just got the Best in the World😉
I respect Cena but this whole "123" promo is so cringy tbh. It's not even funny, believable or entertaining -_-
Will we all knew Roman was going to win
Thank you for killing the hype! Reigns won
I was getting hopes for Cena winning but now after Roman said he leaves if he lose all my hopes disapered
Honestly wwe is just messing with you all! Saying Roman is gonna leave if he loses so that u all think he's gonna win but he's actually gonna lose.
Romain reigns it’s not good on the mic
They might let John win ? Cm punk just made himself all elite!! Wwe needs something that can talked about rite now . Besides rk bro there’s nothing left to talk about. So if wwe smart they let cena win
I actually see John winning then having Big E cash in on him.
I am for Roman Reigns🤙
What a time to be a wrestling fan
wow wwe is stilll 💩💩💩
Everyone knows  Roman is going to win so wwe can keep him.
And just like the they lose the unpredictable factor. Smh
Really hope cena wins and they fetch back brock lesnar. That would be epic! Throw in roman reigns to make it a triple threat too.
Welp, Roman's winning now.
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK !!!!
Cena losing wwe ain’t losing Roman
Is cena or Goldberg win the belt at summer slam I will cut off my manhood
Either I leave as the Universal Champion or I'm leaving WWE for AEW haha
Let's be honest: NO ONE WANTS TO SEE JOHN CENA FOR THE 17TH TIME AS WORLD CHAMPION. It brings nothing to the table. His last two reigns were just as awful and meaningless. On that note, there's no way Reigns won't win tomorrow, but if he loses, well... Just as long as he keeps that heel persona with him everywhere.
If Cena win's this, that will be the Legendary thing of his career, Cena lost againts roman before, but lets see if Cena will did it this time
Now I think reigns will win. WWE would never let him leave the company
Cm punk!
I love John but I think roman will win. It just wouldn't make sense for him to lose at this point
CM Punk AEW OMG
why was the crowd chanting, Roman wasn’t even talking to anyone
Who say wwe is dead??  Look at John Cena and Roman fking Reign here. How could other wrestler company can cope with.  Wait  wwe now only got 2 interesting customers now.
C.M. PUNK!
Well cena is definitely not winning now, wwe literally can not afford to lose Reigns would be a stupid mistake if they did
I wish John Cena would stop using insider terminology on television rubbing in our faces that this is fake and ESPECIALLY like he wasn't getting booed out of buildings for years but still winning most of his matches
Big e boutta cash in mid match 😭😭
CM PUNK IS BACK……IN AEW
Fueron 2 Jamas llego a 3 el comentarista idiota no sabe contar y el otro idiota de Cena tampoco sabe contar Fueron 2
Windham comes back for revenge on roman reigns because we cant see John cena and also we are going back to the 2011 days of cena.
*THE TIME IS NOW. THE FIGHT IS NOW!!!!!*
everyone saying "oh yeah match ruined, Roman retains" I see it as Cena can win, and then somethin gonna happen BTS where Roman comes back at WM38 and gets it back. Like come on give the writers a lil bit of credit, even if they dont deserve it ALL the time
"ONE TWO THREE - You can't see mee"  Nice new slogan
Roman: Or I'm leaving WWE John Cena Smiling: I can care less 😅😅
How many 1-2-3 did Cena mentioned in one promo
John Cenas not playing Roman bouta leave
When Cena said he was gonna take the title and leave until mania lol it confused me how many people cheered for that 🧐🧐
Cena made 1,2,3 turn into some type of what chant
We got Roman and Cena showing the world how it’s done over here and Punk back in wrestling for AEW. What a time to be alive! 🙌🏻
I WANT john cena to win but Vince was NEVER going to let Roman lose the title anytime soon
CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk
i think Cena will win 17th title. John Cena doesn’t have new movie project in next 6-12 months . He had 2, but the production was done. So he can stay longer.
Peacemaker in the ring 😂🖐
When Roman said he’d leave if he loses I knew from there he was gonna win now😂
Wwe just made it less interesting because if Roman says or I'll leave wwe it obviously means he will win because they know everybody is watching smackdown because of the reigns saga but I ain't complaining because I'm a Roman fan
Roman will retain. Big E will cash in and become universal champion
By the way....   CM Punk is back !!!!!!
This chant belongs to sean waltman
If Roman Reigns leavening WWE me too!
This friday was the best day to be a wrestling fan with a John vs reigns promo battle and cm punk
💋123💋💋💪🏻💪🏻123💪🏻⭐⭐🥰🥰👌🏻👌🏻✨✨123🌟🌟🌟⚡⚡🥂🥂🇪🇬🇪🇬123🎊🎊🎉🎉👊🏻👊🏻✊🏻🤣✊🏻😂😂😂😂😆😆😆👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻💥💥😅😅🤜🏻🤜🏻🤛🏻🤛🏻 ١٢٣ / ١٢٣
Wwe and aew both making great strides ... Amazing time to be a wrestling fan
Boring Cena. The part timer. Pls don't tell me they will give him the Title now.
And this was all killed by the return of one CM Punk
Fu** this Match! CM Punk is All Elite  That's all what matters!
No that was 3 I counted it myself
If cena wins roman is living wwe becos of shame
Cena win this match.
That was crazy, the whole segment just wow        Where is Finn Balor though? Lol
CM PUNK IN AEW! YOU S*CK ROMAN 🤮
Well they pretty much gave away the plot. Roman reigns has indicated in the past he had wanted to enter Hollywood like the rock. Looks like he has an upcoming movie. Makes sense for him to step away for a while to pursue it. Therefore, Cena will win so he can better promote his movie
That means Roman is going to win
😂😂😂
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
AEW confirmed
I knew and I know now Reigns is going to retain
Roman Reigns leaves as champion.
No...No..No...its two and the half only...😂 Love u Roman..💪💪💪
Idiots actually told the fans the outcome of the match. Reigns retaining then
John cena gots agility now
to be honest, it's still a question, why is wwe pampering this person too much?  even though he's so boring, his technique is mediocre and his acting is still bad especially in his deep expression huhaaa
Cm Punk!Cm Punk!Cm Punk! Cm punk is backkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!
It’s now clear Roman reigns is the winner for summer slam. He won’t say he will leave wwe unless the title retain script is ready 😂
I don’t think Roman v cena will end just as a clean pin fall and then that’s it night over, there will be a return after the match or an attack etc
Cena shouldn’t go over but he probably will so he can get #17.
Roman on top 🤙🥱✋🤙
I'd love to see Cena win and them take Roman away for a little bit and then him come back twice as vicious with Jacob Fatu. Now that would be interesting
CM PUNK
CM Punk's AEW promo blew this promo away
CM PUNK
John better win I'm so sick of roman reigns now this story is another cm punk bs roman needs to go honestly
Ric Flair has won more than 16 world titles.
I think that Cena knew that Cm punk made his return.
Roman Reigns Is going to leave and fight In the UFC!
Okay I love Reigns with all my heart I do...but let's face it folks he gets buried on the mic by Cena in and out...it breaks my heart
Cm punk
ROMAN BEST
IIIIIIIII LIIIIKE IT
Now I know John cena is not going to win the title because Roman is not leaving wwe
Sooooo Roman is definitely retaining lol.....well that was a spoiler
I don't fall for it. He said that when he was fighting to death with leukemia. We thought he was done and what happened, he came back. He's only doing it to make it interesting
But i see the john cena dead already
Y'all like Roman is going to win because he can't leave WWE. Dude can lose and still stay everybody knows Roman is currently Vince's Golden Boy. Let's see the plot twist at Summerslam! LETSGO BABY!!!
Well Roman’s retaining because there is no way WWE will make Roman leave
It was three because one watching Michael didn’t say anything anything
Cena’s 123 becoming cringe
So you’ve just said romans winning no need to watch this match then jk still should be a good match
Cena can still win lowkey I mean look at Daniel Bryan after he lost he came back and such and this has been done more than once I see like when cena beat the authority kind of gone situation with reigns but a little differently.
NO1 ROMAN Reigns
Man what a weekend we're gonna have in wrestling!!
Like
Roman is winning then ffs
Smackdown better than WWE now
May be john cena forget no marcy match with Roman Empire 2017 😃
Nah cena is not winning. Roman reigns is the best one they have right now. Cena can't be a full time wrestler anymore he makes movies.. you gotta be dumb to think cena is going to win lol
Well its pretty obvious who's winning now...
Sorry but CM Punk is BBBBAAACCCKKKKK!!!!!!!!
Cm Punk
So now we know Roman is winning
Remember this comment. Brock Lesnar or somebody is going to interfere or some bull will happen.
Meanwhile in Chicago
Well if it wasn’t obvious enough now there is no doubt that roman is retaining
So they're literally just trying to recreate MITB 2011, huh? Challenger threatening to leave with the title, champion's job at stake.
Just watch as wwe screw up cena that we all want to win
CM Punk
Romain retains. Aint no way Romain can just got up and leave without finishing his contract. Cena is an ultra part timer.  He aint beating Roman. What a stupid stipulation. Its very obvious who they will choose to win.
Roman will win cena will lose
Im sure alot ppl missed this because they were watching CM Punk return on AEW
Did anyone watch this with CM Punk arriving in AEW? If Vince thinks AEW is not a threat, he needs to wake up.....
Man, I think cena is great on the mic, but this was weak. Most of his points were basically about himself there was no validity to any of his words. Also I see Chris Jericho's rival "Wacky Roll-up Guy" is back.
So Reigns win 100%
There’s no way reigns is leaving so he ain’t losing.
With the return of Punk . It is awesome to a see both companies are firing at 1000% percent!
Yeah he leaving WWE gonna call Tony Khan & we'll see a tweet saying welcome to the team Joe Anoa'i is All Elite LMAO. But seriously this will be a fantastic main event but it clear WWE did not care to give a proper story because of that very reason alone. Oh & WWE threw Reigns into the firing line with his Punk comments could not be more wrong as we see tonight & what we know about Punk.
If Roman Reigns quits we riot and I'm done with WWE AEW is winning me over day by day
This is exactly why people can't stand Vinces booking style. He gives people no hope. Everybody KNEW Roman was going to win, because he's their guy, and Cena is the old guy here to put him over, who is functionally retired. But in a real promotion, they would give you the hope that Cena would win, before they snatched it away from you and put the heel over. Vince isn't even giving people the hope, he's making you either watch the match already deflated or you just won't bother watching at all now because they just spoiled the end result.
Who's better on Smackdown?  A. Pat McAfee B. Corey Graves
So basically we know Roman is winning......
1.   2.   3.    Its Cluuuubbbberiiiing Timeeeee!!
Spotlight today is all for the Best 💪
CM PUNK AEW and STING and BIG SHOW LOL EPIC
Cena the new 1-2-3 Kid
Well there goes any chances of Cena willing tomorrow
Cm Punk.
Imagine if he lose
Who here was actually watching SD live, knowing what was goin on on the other brand?
Raise the stakes to make it an "I Quit" match then it will be even better also will be an epic match for sure haha.
Cm punk return...he is back... Bye bye wwe
WWE added some stakes to the match because they knew CM Punk would debut on AEW and they needed something for fans to talk about tomorrow other than CM Punk 🤣 what they don’t realize is fans will still be talking about Punk for weeks
On thise day 1 one year ago wwe took place at the thunderdom 😂😂😂😂
2:36 Paul Heyman faCe.
The hype for summerslam died tonight because of AEW rampage cm punks return lmao wwe has died.
If it’s a loser leaves match it’s gonna be Roman retaining and as much as I want to see cena win I don’t think it’s gonna happen
Trash
No 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
So it’s final roman will win 😵😵😂😂👍
So it’s a guarantee Roman is winning😂😂
So... we know roman is winning now right?
John Cena attire is like his old Subway CommerCial deals.
All this hype just for Cena to job to reigns 😂
this is the best feud in recent memory. Excited to see the match.
John cena will lose ....i am telling you right know...because its about carer of roman reings..roman will fight till his last breath...
7 years later punk is still out-doing cena
CM Punk💙
CM Punk is ALL ELITE.
Return of the 123 kid confirmed lol
They always ruin it when they threaten to leave wwe
wow  A E W ,WWE I can't take it out of it's amazing it's like my head is exploding from all the good content I'm getting welcome back CM Punk welcome back Cena
Cena gonna lose again!!!
Cena calling Roman protected, is a kettle and pot situation
Its annoying now *1,2,3*
Brock lesnar better return, AEW just got heated.
Quick Fact:John Cena win his first match by a roll up
Way to give the finish away, takes all hype from match
so Reigns wins at Summerslam huh? who could have thought
Maybe Roman wants to leave the WWE already
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
So Cena gave us a preview of how he gon' win the Universal Title, amazin'.
CM Punk is back.
That damn eye roll after Cenas 1. 2. 3.   Roman needs a face cam 24/7
now it is ovious that "here is your winner and still your universal champion,roman riegns
PUNK IS ALL ELITE
He not gonna leave wwe at all its scripted to make the people exsitement
McAfee best commentator of smackdown XD
Finally the G.O.A.T CM PUNK is back in pro wrestling!!!
Cena is still seriously annoying on the mic.
So CM PUNK overshadowed all of this 🤫🤫🤫🤭🤭
Did Roman forget he was in tha fast franchise 😂😂😂 cause he paused for little bit 😂😂😂
Punk Is AEW
Imagine, roman retains and big e is cashin in  at summerslam!
Roman Riegns is the most powerful unstoppable universal champion in the world always I do believe that he is loved by most
so now we all know roman will win, because he aint leaving WWE, nice.
Please tell me. Do WWE fans honestly think that WWE is not just like a panto? Its practiced and sorted B4 hand.  Good entertainment but not a sport.
So that's the match result given away then, no way is Vince gonna see Roman leave the WWE, FACT.
I hope John Cena comes in the Peacemaker costume....
Wtf roman is leaving?
I'm looking for CM Punk AEW comments here, but seems like there's not much!
Did I just get interested in wrestling again?!...
its not raising the stake ,its stating the obvious that reigns would still . . . . . .
Roman reigns to aew confirmed
CM punk is all elite nobody cares about summerslam anymore
Looks odd not seeing him in peacemaker outfit lmao
John doesn’t stand a chance
Roman is gonna win obviously
Cm punk is all elite
Roman's contract ends sometime this year & he has said he wants to make movies & do other things.  But I think the match could go either way.
And we should all know that's a lie.😒 Roman just going to take a vacation. He's still on contract....  What Cena is saying that if Roman don't  perform in the match Roman will getbthe que to lose.
Match is 💩 now!! Really wanted to see John win.
Cena is only back temporarily. He has more movie commitments.
John cena is nothing no win
I just feel like someone is going to invade this match and nobody is going win 😂😂😂I'm just in dilemma don't know my favorite winner here
Oh please we all know that Cena can't beat Romans reigns 😕, Romans is the king of the table.
I got Cena winning cause Roman still can't cut a good promo so please Cena do us a favor and send the Tribal Chief outta here for good
I actually feel like Cena might lose cause I don’t think Wwe will just let go of Roman just like that.
I am very glad rampage starts after smackdown
Would it have made more since if he said “ or I’m leaving Smackdown” because than it can still be a match that goes either way. If Roman does lose( which he probably won’t), he can go to RAW, raise the ratings and have fire matches with Drew, Bobby, Randy
AEW>WWE
It's possible Roman does lose and goes away for a bit during the ramp up of Covid while Cena takes the wheel for a few months.
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
People are looking forward to this? WWE is boring now..... Lack of stars.... Bring back Ruthless aggression
The BEST wrestling week ever in history 😁😁
Bruh. Cena's promo game has never been better
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
*01:54** To be fair, the only Hollywood thing Roman do is a Johnny Nobody in stale Fast and Furious movie.*
WWE just made it obvious that Roman is gonna win
AEW>WWE
Now I’m not interested anymore in this match, because Roman will never leave the WWE, so he will never lose this match.
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
AEW>WWE
AEW>WWE
Man oh man, lmao when I see looks of Roman Reigns after Cena pin him down, 1,2,3 😁😁😁😁😁😜
CM Punk :)
Imagine missing the most epic comeback in the history of wrestling to see this... reminds me of when mankind won the title and hogan did the poke of death.
Cm punk is back🔥🔥
1..2..3.. got repetitive typical Cena
1:48 I don't know if Romans little tangent right there is directed towards Cena. Definitely some electrifying family baggage going on...
CM Punk’s AEW debut so far on YouTube has more viewers then a segment promoting the MAIN EVENT of SUMMERSLAM that includes JOHN CENA.
"Either I leaving that stadium as Universal Champion, or I'm leaving WWE". What a way to spoil a could have been epic "Main Event" match. It's now crystal clear that Roman will win & retain the Universal Championship.
So big e or Corbin will cash in when romen wins or Roman's done
"When was the last time I lost?"  Did he lose a match to Loan Wolf on SD around the end of 2019? Otherwise Erick Rowan at Clash of Champions (RIP Jon)  Either way, the pandemic saved Vince the humiliation of the almighty returning hero leaving to even bigger blahs/boos than Wrestlemania 32, because his 2019 was terrible, perhaps as payback (acknowledgement, hehe) for cramming him to the UC the previous year and then totally wasting the one thing he could do (Shield) anyway
Shut him up roman
CM punk
What a great time to be a wrestling fan! This promo, Punk's return on AEW, Edge vs Rollins, so many things to watch out for! 🔥
I’m calling it Roman is going to AEW!!!!!!!
CM PUNK AEW!!!!!
Cena is going to lose so don’t be surprise
“This is missionary position in every single night“😂  cena vs punk,punk wins Cena vs Brock, Brock wins Cena vs Rollins, Rollins wins 2 titles This year cena vs reigns Romans gonna win. Missionary position over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. if you really think Roman reigns is leaving WWE you are more gullible than I thought
Cena hat tho😭
Cena wins Roman and cena take time off to film fast 15.  Big e to cash in at ss confirmed
pat needa get a mic instead of a headset 😂
Dude cena will lose, too many talk and promo..believe that
CM Punk
I’m all aboard that Roman leaving wwe
With Roman raising the stakes literally makes the match unpredictable because everyone was expecting John to win. WWE is now in a serious competition with AEW. It's time to establish Roman Reigns both on microphone and in the ring to have a competitive advantage.
Roman sounds so much like the rock at 1:54 Damn a promo between these two is gonna be weird
Roman Reigns is 100% winning this after stating he's leaving. Sadge, this could be the best send off Cena would have after all he's done. Heck even with this promo he shat on Reigns
So I wonder if this roll up pin will go on the counter for Simon 🤔
What was Roman Reigns going for? Never seen him do that.
Yeah Finn Balor gonna distract the match 😅😅
Welcome back CM Punk
They spoiled the result
Typical watch one of them get injured or a surprise debut or return lol
I thought that when roman said he was gonna raise the stakes in their match, I thought that it was gonna be the rock in his corner, and vin diesel in cena's corner since the rock and roman were brothers on hobbs and shaw while cena and vin diesel were brothers on F9 lol XD
Cmpunk
Remember my comment  Cena will win by disqualification  Reigns will retain and won't leave   Vince always have a way to screw up things
Tomorrow Saturday
Why would they add that stipulation? It’s completely obvious as to who’s winning now
Can I say I am more hyped up about the Main Event of Summerslam than Cm punk returning
Aew return cm punk!!!
WWE and NBA have similar agendas, I see. Vince and Adam are friends and share ideas.
Who care punk is back
For anyone who didn't watch AEW. CM Punk has return to wrestling. THE BEST IN THE WORLD IS BACK!!!!
Roman: If I lose I will leave WWE Well congrats to Roman Reigns on retaining the Universal title
The match after the show was amazing
Lol. Now we know Roman is winning. Surely wwe creative isn’t that good to make Roman leave wwe.
What a ridiculous thing the roll up. After 3 minutes ago CM PUNK was All-Elite
Every time John cena says 1.2.3 Roman reigns get mad
I am Team Reigns but I hope Cena will win the title so Finn Balor can defeat Cena and then Reigns
Cm punk is back
I hope  Cena wins, bye Roman.
Look like half of a shield reunión in all petite wrestling
As much as I want John Cena to be a 17 time champ I also don't want Roman reigns to leave wwe I love the head of the table
Cena promo keep repeat 123 is kinda boring.. don’t keep say the same thing..
Good
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Well it's 1 2 and he kicked out
Well we know Roman's winning
CM Punk! CM Punk!
CM Punk and John Cena both back in the ring, it's a great time for wrestling fans
Cena has nothing to lose
Cm punk!
I love Roman !!!! But CM PUNK overshadowed this by a long shot lol.
Topppppppppp✌🤩
Roman Reigns is All Elite 😂
Cena too much talk
I think neither of them will win this match, I think this story line is pointing toward Big E Lanson coz he has the brief case
Roman Leaving Wwe ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 That’s So Cap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🧢 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1..2...CM PUMK!!!!!
Cena deserves that 17th title...But this is so obvious that it won't happen...But he's GOAT either way 🤷🏻‍♂️
Y'all remember when Cena buried Roman on the mic back in 2017?
With flair leaving and with a big possibility he signs with aew im already thinking cenas gonna win..
Kinda like when Chael said "Anderson Silva you absolutely suck, Silva I'm calling you out but we're upping the stakes if I win you leave the divsion but if you win I will leave the UFC" but every MMA fan knows how that went just hope Cena wins tho
John is losing. It’s so obvious
Cena listen roman will deploy u back at the  US army tomorrow
cm punk.
123 and still your
Does WWE really think that by Reigns stating that if he loses he walks will bring in more buys (yeah, they probably do)? All it did is let everyone know that Reigns is retaining.
Wwe is straight up predictable. Its obvious roman is gonna retain and after he retains cena gonna go back to Hollywood
I think the stipulation that Roman revealed was too much.
Roman said “ either I’m Leaving that stadium as universal champion or I’m leaving wwe “ either John wins and Roman is off television for a long time or Roman wins and big e cashes the contract .. so this makes sense in a way
I have a strong feeling that Roman will retain given that this maybe cena last match before he goes back to Hollywood. Cena is a part-timer and he should not become a 17x world champion since he doesn’t wrestle on television. After Roman successful title defense, I can see Cena turning heel.
Big kid emerging against legend
Cena just returned and I'm already tired of him "1 2 3" how many times must he say that?
CM Punk promos r still far better
Cena hit the most devastating movie in WWE today  the one move (besides the one winged angel) that puts 99.9% of there victims away the one the only the greatest move in wrestling history……….. THE SCHOOLBOY ROLLUP everyone 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤌🏾
Its funny how reigns goes on john cena about going to hollywood. Ummmm didnt his roman cousin “ the rock” do the samething so roman disrecpting the rock which is his family. Head of the table really got to his head fr fr.
Tu turu tuuuuuu tu turu tuuuuuuu
I can't wait for tomorrow night so many good matches!
CM PUNK!!!!
So reigns surely will retain maybe I'm  controversial  way so they can repeat at wrestlemania
Joe Anoai is ALL ELITE
Great job WWE on spoiling the match
CM Punk coming back to wwe would be an honor, but he's already in aew
Roman reigns tribal joke, Romen Reigns tribal joke, Romen Reigns tribal joke
Johns gonna win since Roman said if he loses he will leave
Lol that commentry by Pat 😂😂
cm punk cm punk
Johns gonna win easy
Нфр and nsw Russian wrestling 😂😂😂
I want John Cena to win but at the same time I want roman reigns to win bc i don't want him to leave wwe
A good marketing and profitable PPV would be WWE vs AEW at Survivor Series!!!
Prolly Roman lose and head to RAW to save the show and increase his number of titles or he's really taking the time out ... Also yea him winning is the obvious reason but why would he have such high stakes when we all know he winning so kinda excited to see if there's any surprise element prolly the Rock silently returning or sumn
We know that Roman will win the match at SummerSlam because of this segment.
1 , 2 , 3 ,  You can't See Me!!!
Thanks WWE for the spoiler on who's gonna win at summerslam.
Only Smackdown and Rampage can give Quality Wrestling rn.
Vince has got some talent . How he sharpened his boy (cena) into what he is today. I mean in the end it's just "1-2-3"..what a promo 👏👊
Roman reigns to aew confirmed
I can't lie I need a little while before I rewatch this because Punks entrance has just been looping in my brain at the moment
CM PUNK RATIOED THIS VIDEO.
Is anyone bored of Cena? Hes overrated ;-;. Like fr. In my opinion of course, I think hes good but I think wwe is making him out to be better than he really is. I think they should stop bringing cena in to ruin other people and give others chances. Tbh hes old news imo. I think he is one of the most corperate made wrestlers in wwe. Lmk what y'all think? ;-;
Zzzzz
😴 💤... I got Brock interrupting the match
Using John Cena’s acting career as a line in a promo has gotten repetitively annoying.
John Cena at the hospital. John Cena: "Where am I?" Nurse: "ICU." John Cena: "No you cant."
yang dari indonesia mana suara nya untuk john cena
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
2017 Lesnar said that and won 2021 I hope not
i cannot stop laughing! Because john cena running style is very funny🤣🤣🤣
Usos interference Roman gets upper hand n chokes out Cena
While y’all are yaming your mouths out AEW HAS CM PUNK NOW
Roman loses and goes AEW like everyone else
Paul Heyman actually didn't talk he is annoying has no business being there and no one cares about him.  Cena is a good actor by the way as for the Mizz no way not ever.
ok roman reings really needs to stay universal champion cause I really want him to stay in wwe
Confirmed reigns wins at summerslam
CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!!  CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!! CM PUNK!!
Roman  , Put John in his place,👍🤣😅🙏👍😄😁
What are you doing here, CM Punk is at AEW
👌👌👌👌🖐️🖐️I like you John Cena ❤️❤️❤️
CM Punk is better than these 2 jobbers
Weak promo not Roman fault it’s John Cenial mr missionary hurry up n smash him
Yes John Cena is the best he's gonna put Roman reigns down
Yo his hat never fell off
who cares cm punk is back ?
They gonna make john cena loose at summer slam cuz they can’t let Roman go
I love what john did at the last🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They did Finn Balor dirty again
That would've been three forget a dramatic ref fall to just to count that definitely would've been 3 and Roman's look says it all. You mess up badly even once and that title is gone. I want Cena to win, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna have Roman win just so he doesn't leave.
Yup cena losing this match
I am putting the money on cena
RR is the BEST
CM PUNK IS BACK!
That looked like a 2 count to me unless it was a fast count but I can feel that Roman Reigns is going to win tomorrow.
So guys I’m smart bla bla bla Roman wins becuse wwe wants romen therw
This went from “a match that could go either way”, to “yeah Roman’s retaining” real quick
I think I know where this is going now but we'll see tomorrow
CM PUNK!!!!!!!!
Okay, it's official: Reigns will retain the title.
Ah yes Smackdown the b show, literally everywhere but raw is on fire with wrestling right now.
Sorry Cena. I love you but ima go watch punk on aew
I subscribed to your channel and I press (🔔) button & and I joined the Notifications Squad to
Pats great on the mic, great addition to the show
Watch balor interfere summer slam then wrestle mania will be a triple threat for the title
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
Hey you fans going to Summerslam tomorrow......TAKEOVER THAT SHOW WITH PUNK CHANTS! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT!

CM PUNK CM PUNK
Roman's promo skills has really improved since the last time these 2 met, excellent 👍
Pack your Bags Roman Reigns you are going to lose your title and fired WWE
WWE you just had to ruin your mainevent by making it the most predicable match ever geez i wonder whos going to win tomorrow night so hard to decide
Bye WWE, CM Punk is back!!!!
This means Roman will win it💔💔💔
What ever roman win or not i still love it cuz im roman fan so i would like to see him pretend the title but if i losse hes left wwe maybe he will join aew and im dont have any problem with that
Cm punk back aew
Cena being a massive hypocrite with the protection stuff
Cena is waiving the WWE flag meanwhile CM Punk is waiving his AEW flag. WHAT A TIME TO BE A WRESTLING FAN!
at first I thought there's a chance Joh could actually win but after that statement, Roman's definitely retaining
Great you spoiled the match, Roman is gonna win! Thanks WWE no wonder AEW is beating you!
Tbh, I know Roman gonna win at summerslam
That was 2 and who has john cena beat lately!!
Yeah but CM Punk
John cena is the only very champ! Roman at summerslam you lose.1..2....3!
John Cena just stole Drew McIntyre promos, also not feeling it. Roman destroy him on mic, tho.
I think cena just confirmed he will be at wrestlemania next year " see u there" he said
Wouldn't be such a bad idea to see Roman follow the same path as the rock Cena n Batista.
WWE Files New Trademark 123
Well this all but confirmed Reigns is winning.
Cena won't beat Roman. He has too much respect for Flair to beat the record.
So who ever loses goes to AEW
Cm Punk is back but not WWE 💔😥
OmG RoMaN tO aEw
Who's keen to watch that match it's going to be interesting is Roman reigns really going to leave WWE if he loses are you fuckn serious
CM Punk .
2:33 WWE tried to pull that same move when brock lesnar returned in 2012.
Well it's confirmed. Cena is gonna lose
Ok so after this promo we all know Cena gonna lose. :(
Hope Cena Train soo goood so he doesn’t get embarrassed
A childish 1...2...3 segment.
Give Pat his well-deserved pay raise
All I have to say is... CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
Cena will bring the title to aew
They just wrote themselves into a corner. Whatever doubts anyone had about Roman retaining have just been confirmed. There's no way he's not retaining.
career vs record match, reminds me of undertaker vs hbk
Yes
AEW
CM PUNK!!! CM PUNK!!! CM PUNK! HAHAHAHA
Po Roman mó cara de bunda
Just would like to point out that the number of views of this vid from 2 hours ago is less than a QUARTER of AEW equivalent at over 450k views.  🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣
Roman is gonna go to AEW if Cena wins
Leati Joseph Anoaʻi is all elite.
1,2,3 The champ is here.
So......if roman loses, does that mean we can finally see roman reigns vs cm punk at aew finally?
"He kicked out at 2 and a half I think, but sure, point taken"    Pat is a special part of wwe rn
Who cares… CM Punks on AEW! 🤣🔥
Ok so Romans winning for sure
Hello everyone
Love love 💕 Roman Riengs
Well, Reigns is winning.
Welp Cena isn't winning lol
"I'll leave WWE." So Roman is retaining.
Cena with the most devastating move in all of WWE.
CM PUNK!
WWE JUST GAVE A SPOILER ITS OBVIOUS NOW THAT ROMAN REIGNS GONNA WIN HE AINT GONNA LEAVE THE WWE
Cena lost to roman previously but he will win this time and i think will be leaving wwe. But let's see hahahaha.
Wait till you hear 1 2 3 in WWE 2K22
I can't wait to see John Cenq winning the Universal Championship this SummerSlam and then remobe his mask and reveal himself as The 1-2-3 Kid.
Sorry for you Cena, Reign gonna punish you and you will cry like baby
This won't be easy then, Roman leaving WWE if he loss lol
CM PUNK!!
And today cm punk is aew🥲
John cena has a lot of the same lines tbh
Roman wins this match confirmed
We all know Roman is going too win.... But Cena is awesome on the mic. Roman on the otherhand.... Not so much.
Well I don’t need to watch this match anymore because Roman clearly wins
Roman winning confirmed....
It's been an interesting week in wrestling... to me cm punk's debut won aew for the week... but summerslam is tomorrow so that will be one to watch
Roman leaves wwe, I stop watching wwe
Yes please. Come to all elite Roman and beat kenny. ✌️✌️ In serious note. I predict Roman will win this match.
Punk is all elite
Pat McAfee makes the commentary feel real for the first time in a long time, really surprised and delighted with his contributions to Smackdown and this feud in particular.
CM PUNK is Now In AEW, The best in the world.
Smackdown and RK-Bro are the only things i watch from wwe now.
CM PUNK!!!
100% Cenas winning tomorrow because of that comment, why else would WWE from out of nowhere say “Roman will leave of he loses”, it’s Roman Reigns, they ALWAYS have a plan with him
What a challenge leaving wwe 😳 👏 really terrible challenge I'm waiting for roman win
CM PUNK
CM PUNK
but but but..  if you look at it.  If Cena wins the match, who's likely the suitable person gonna have a feud w him? think about it.  Is it Seth or Edge?  or neither of them? Cuz i think Big E is not gonna cash in his MITB at the moment cuz he has a lil bit feud against Baron rn so who is gonna be?  I dont know why but i hope. I hope is gonna be Finn i mean c'mmon his the first one to held the tittle, although just for a day.  He deserve to reign that tittle again like for 100+ days
Meanwhile in Chicago: 😱😱😱 🔥🔥🔥  The Best In The World!
Now we know Roman is not losing
"When people step in the ring with me, I smash 'em so bad that WWE have no use for them, ya understand?" Sick line
cm punk cm punk cm punk
Now things just got abit more interesting
What is your prognosis ?
Roman go to aew! Meet CM Punk! Hahaha
This was a weird night in Wrestling history.  And I don't think it is over, I predict John Cena will win his 17th World title at SummerSlam.  Why?  Because I think Roman is doing another movie and require to be written off TV for a small break.
Christ if he gets a fruit rollup win.....
i just came for the CM punk return!
Sadly he wont seems the plan is to retire cena. I honestly dont want this if RR loses he leaves wwe that already is the spoiler who wins unless he wants to retire and leave
Damn it! Now we know for sure Roman's gonna win. Who the hell made the decision to raise the stakes?!
Of Roman loses im never watching wwe anymore
So roman is gonna leave if he loses....    Well now we know he will win thx wwe
If wwe somehow made peace with punk already and signed him again if he comes back and cost cena the title everyone would be Okay with it
Roman can't battle Cena in promos
Boooooorrrrriiiing
wwe still has this "superstars" selling us stories from the 80's
Roman reign’s promo & cm punk’s return😂😂😂 Roman my kid you gotta learn a lot… wwe sucks…
Well we now know the outcome for sure….
If Reigns loses he’s joining CM Punk at AEW.
Well that just took all the fun out of the match. Roman is gonna win. The WWE just let go of so many people they won't let the top guy go
CM Punk promos are far better
Cm punk! Cm punk! Cm punk!
Jhon Cena is best
Roman won’t be going anywhere Cena is too busy making movies and tv shows
They pretty much told you that Reigns is leaving with the title. There’s no way they’d keep him off tv right now.
Looks like Cena is losing then
So if one of them lose they leaves wwe?
CM PUNK AEW!!!!!
"the tribal chad". Tf?
CM Punk just returned to professional wrestling on AEW Rampage
All right I was thinking if I was Team Roman or Team Cena I’m still thinking about Cena becoming a 17-time world champion or Roman defeating him in SummerSlam to make him stronger But when Roman says or I'm leaving WWE, I already know who will win
Summerslam weekend, CM Punk back in wrestling business. Great year of wrestling industries.
1,2,3 cena ganhou!
Cm punk
Omg this challenge is very scary roman challenge with his life roman will win God bless you roman i love you
CM PUNK🎯
CM PUNK!!
Criticizing each other about being a movie star yet almost every WWE star is a movie star 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
CM PUNK IS BACK!!
Its 3 count but we cant see them !
CM PUNK IS AEW
the war again
CM PUNK IS BACK!!! my bad , wrong channel
Atleast Roman now knows how to cut promos 😂😂😂
Same ‘ol same ‘ol WWE. Stale. And he didn’t fake pin him for 3. Same ‘ol… (yawn) I’m going to sleep. 😉
ROMAIN SHAME.
0:35 bill gates 😱
Well cm punk is back
I was here tonight and wow it was such a great show!
I swear If wwe makes Roman reigns/the most entertaining part of wwe currently Lose to a part timer and he has to quit. I’m gonna find vince.
Olha a atitude do roman mano 🤔😉👑
John Cena Don't Suck ...But When He Is With THE TRIBAL CHIEF, He Sucks 100%
Even tho I appreciate Reigns run. Now that punks back, later WWE ✌️. Fix ya product
Cenas annoying
Simply Amazing
Imagine cena wins like this at summerslam as a 17th time champ omg😂
The fact is both of them on fast on furious before
If Roman loses and leaves WWE...I won’t watch wwe for the rest of my life. This is why ppl leaves WWE cuz new talents are crushed here against ppl to just make new championship records!!
Roman Reigns wearin Yeezy Boost Static !!! 😎😎😎
CM punk is back on AEW!!!
Biggest plot twist of all would be if Roman losses and shows up on AEW and then we find out that AEW and WWE are working together thus all the releases.  A man can only dream.
Wwe just told us who is going to win
He really played the rocks lines that's crazy cuz
Cm punk
CM PUNK
Roman just won tomorrow
Cena won't beat him.. Reigns is selling tickets..
I hope he leaves honestly lol
If Roman wins, we are done!!
Punks return to AEW is gonna mean they HAVE to put Cena on top. They need a big moment
Both in fast & furious universe.. i hope they clash in that movie one day
Yeah, bold prediction. Romans not losing
Cena is win.       He have too
2:22 ok no more point to watch this match, oops we all know roman is winning this cause they setting up roman vs rock at mania. They are just putting names to list of people roman beats to solidify this run.
I was there for that and it sucks I didn't hear commentary
I SWEAR IF ROMAN LEAVES WWE IM DONE WITH Y'ALL
Roman gonna lose this match and coming back as a babyface 🤷🏼‍♂️
Cena looking like a quaker state mascot
So by telling us Roman will quit if he looses summerslam I guess he know who will win now.....
2 ½
Pat is the best thing about smack down and needs to be protected at all costs
Honestly everything John is saying is bs Roman actually made WWE more interest thanks to him for real. And John is a wanna be Rock 😂😂😂
Well we know reigns is keeping the belt now.
cena will def win
Cm punk
I would like to take this moment to thank WWE for everything they have tried to do for these past 7 years but it's finally time for me to move on to an all elite product. Welcome back CM Punk.
Cay
CM Punk! CM Punk! CM Punk! CM Punk!
Download wwe immortals
Well now we know roman is going to win for sure
💜
Who cares about Vinces joke of a show when CM PUNK IS BACK!!!!!
Who would've thought in 2021 Reigns blows Punk out of the water at a promo. Strange times
CM Punk > Roman Reigns
1 2 3 you cant see me
Bad booking, y’all just telegraphed the outcome. Y’all made it seem like Cena had a chance with all the videos and talk about getting a 17th world title but this just stomped on that build up
Boring wrestling tonight until 10:00
CM PUNK!!!!
It's looks liked 1-2-3 movement from the YES! movement.
CM Punk!
Roman Mic Skills Was Awesome in this
Wow typical WWE throwing the result of the match already have roman say he's leaving WWE just confirmed that roman will beat cena tomorrow thanks WWE you really know how to spoil the excitement
This is soooo GOOOD!!!
1:37 That fan with the sign represents me
is this scripted?
This is cool and all, but CM Punk just destroyed this show.
Cena is becoming boring
How did WWE manage to screw this up? Roman wins now obviously! Spoilt what could have been a classic. This decision just sums up WWE these days perfectly. Someone needs to intervene if this is Vince's doing, before it's too late, he's even gone and ruined NXT now, the only highlight of the company at this time.
I hope they make this a classic without any interruptions from Roman's cousins.
Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM.....  oops, wrong company
welcome back CM PUNK
CRINGE XRODEE : Who's Here CM Punk Debut In AEW It Break's My Heart? 💔 He Is The Worst In The World AUGUST 21, 2021
I find it interesting that this segment and the CM Punk segment was both posted a hour ago. You know Vince seen that and in a last minute attempt to pull the hype back his way he threw out this stipulation🤣 sell out and give the title to cena and lose Roman to AEW or do the smart thing leave the belt with Roman and keep the ship a float for aslong as you can.🤣
Cena will pin roman at SummerSlam like he does in this smackdown week lol
It's 3 if you have ref. who is counting fast. 😅
No why roman stay
So they have just told us Roman is winning
John Cena was expecting Roman to attack 🤣
Man this and CM punk debuting on AEW made my night
The stress roman reigns
so, roman’s retaining :/
You know wwe is in the mud when cm punk is back
Cm punk ***
John cena is talkative very irritating
Yeah reigns can go 2 HW any time....because of the ROCK...thats the only reason he was in fast and f. and hes still in wwe...without rock he would be nothing...in fact..he is...but so is cena..all he said 2 rock years ago about Hollywood and so...now he only have 2 look in the mirror...would be an unbel. Joke when he become an 17...cant write it down...RIC FLAIR WILL ALWAYS BE NR1!!..wooooo!!
CM PUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think we can all agree this'll be better than Goldb- sorry... Oldberg vs Lashley.
Who's here after CM Punk's debut in AEW
If only CM punk debuted here on smackdown. That way if John loses cm punk can be the one to take the universal championship
Cm punk cm punk
If Roman Reigns loses he will be going to shoot movies in Hollywood that's why he said he'll leave WWE
With that statement of him leaving, we now know who is gonna win
He saying he quit WWE and join aew to meet his bro
What viewer is silly enough to be convinced by that stipulation?
This segments basically told us Romans gonna win, no way he loses and leaves WWE
Cm punk
Well that’s all it took for them to say that Roman won unless big E cashes in
Who cares cm punk is back
No point watch this fight now,  Obvious Roman not leaving WWE
Bruh, Roman's poker face is something you don't wanna mess with...
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
MEANWHILE IN AEW.
I mean no matter what they put on, nothing beats what aew did tonight
Dam it y better not be leaving to to AEW
They just made it obvious that Roman was gonna win. I guess it’s best for the wwe but now there’s no suspense
Regardless of who wins it’ll never match the amount of energy at AEW when CM PUNK made his debut!!
Why do i have feelings that cena gonna lose 😅😅😅
Don't hv any expectation when this compare to cm punk debut aew's view
this match is too predictable now
Most of the Times Who's Career on Line Will Win 😂😂
I know John Cena the OG, but I'm here for Roman🇦🇸✊🏽
Now this is the return of the wrestling business. LET'S GO!!!!
Aww man now Roman Reigns is gonna keep the title 😭 cuz Mr McMahon doesn't want him to leave
Just so you people know CM punk is back he is on a Aew
BTW CM PUNK TO AEW, CM PUNK CM PUNK
Man Tribal Chief Leaving WWE if he loses is gonna make me sad But i also want Cena to win
Cm punk is back
I mean Cena can win number 17......But the actual number of Flair’s reigns is 21......and then even still Flair is the GOAT so if nothing else.....Have fun out there John Boy.....
Cena win beat the record and then Big E use Money in the Bank case and win over Cena
john looks skinny, smaller arms, slick face, his neck got small too..dang
The REAL "  BEST IN THE WORLD" IS Back
Cena is losing TheGreatOne said so
Lol that wasn’t even three I swear
Was there tonight it was badass
Clearly Roman will win
Aew may get the shield
Cm punk is AEW
That kind of writing to "raise the stakes" really is just a set up for the storyline to have Roman Reigns retain the title.
Cm punk is all elite!
CM PUNK CM PUNK
Why are they making “1, 2, 3” a catchphrase lmfaoo….other than that this is epic rn
He did “The most devastating move in all off wrestling, the surprise roll up!!”
So it’s obvious John isn’t gna win , but hear me out big E cashes in during the match and the next pay per view is a tripple threat match
Cm punk! Cm punk! Cm punk!
Honestly what a time to be a wrestling fan.
So cena will lose roman as soon as possible
Smackdown is now better than raw, i watch raw but there's nothing special, maybe randy orton and riddle are cool but nothing else
Cena looks small now
Bro JOHN  is going to win for sure. Mark my words cena losing has as much chance of happening as CM punk coming back.
CM Punk is back and WWE sucks. ❤️
Man, Roman ain't going anywhere. 😂😂😂Why they fronting?
Roman wins.
Cena going lose. The Golden boy roman aint leaving wwe cmon now. Lol
Cm punk is back
Jour right john cena love you
Goodbye WWE CMBank is back.
Cena and roman is best
Chill nobody cares about Roman and wwe
The fact that Roman said if he doesn't leave summerslam universal champion then he's leaving WWE makes me think he's contract is up or he's going on a break
Well now we know Roman is gonna win wwe isn't stupid enough to let Roman go 🙄
Pat is big funny
Reigns pulled out a move outta Lesnar’s playbook. Now he ain’t losing at Summerslam..
Cm punk on aew🤩
BRING BACK CM PUNK!!
I do not like Cena’s promo’s…they’re way too personal…never thought I’d say this, but I am not liking Cana one bit….
Well bye wwe going to aew after summerslam BECAUSE THE BEST IN THE WORLD IS IN AEW!!
Lol roman plz if brock Lesnar came back Paul Heyman will leave your side and go right back to him
John cena is losing sooooo bad tomorrow
we will see adout that cenna
I thought cena was going to win but after romen said that he will leave wwe if he lost.  Just proves he will win
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Setting up for Cena to take the loss. What's even the point in bringing him back
So uh where is that bone Balor had to pick with Cena? Because I didn't see him anywhere tonight. Please stop shoehorning people into feuds and then taking them off TV. It makes no sense for Balor to have beef with someone and then he just up and vanishes for no reason. Cena ain't gonna show up next Friday after losing tomorrow just to get a talking to from the guy that tried to replace him.
There is no doubt that Roman win
I think john should win
you're making it more predictable for roman to win at summerslam, vince...*facepalm*
Well now we know somehow reigns wins, cause WWE ain't letting him leave or take a break while he's on this hot streak, so that kinda ruined it for me knowing now Roman for sure winning which I believed to begin with that they just brought Cena in to give him the rub and bring in ratings, the end game is and has always been the rock vs Roman, when rock has time out of his schedule. Rock will win and they will run it back and Roman will win it back. That's the end game kinda like they did Cena and rock
Okay that 1-2-3 promo is cringe af
cena gonna lost....roman is too hot to leave the wwe right now
If he don’t win He will leave wwe? Thanks for letting us know Roman is winning.
It’s obvious that WWE won’t allow Roman Reigns to leave which means that it’s obvious that Roman is gonna retain
Roman looked like a little boy after that roll up☠️☠️☠️
Jhon win
Badass Roman Reigns
Cena let go to early
Cena will turn heel
Please all that is Holly please cena win I’m begging and praying you win cena
Dude i really love john but i also dont want Roman to go
rip wwe after cmpunk
i have watched the promo 8 times in row
Good God Cena is so damn good on the mic!
Good promo but I don’t really like it when they do the ultimatum thing. Cuz now we know Roman will win unless he takes a hiatus like he did when he debuted this heel character.
Two of the most overrated and untalented of all time. WWE needs to quit pushing garbage like this.
CM Punk just made this whole feud irrelevant
That was absolutely dumb lol
Ok so this guarantees Roman will win lol, no way wwe let’s Roman go anywhere
Meanwhile on AEW…CM PUNK 😂
CM PUNK IS BACK
Cm punk
Lo que se viene  Esto lo veía solo en sueños después del no mercy Pero mañana  Pelea por el título conchaversal  El señor sobrevalorado y jefe de la tribu la cabeza de la mesa el villano cara de la empresa Roman reigns vs El señor títulos mundiales idolo de los niños heroe cara de la empresa JOHN CENA
So WWE spoiled who is going to win by saying that Roman would leave if he loss so there going to let Roman Win so He can Stay WWE sometimes I hate you but I love you
Now that we know Roman is going to win because his career is on the line...next!
brock lesnar return??? 2:22
Who’s here after the return of cm punk
CM Punk is back baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AE f::kin W
Leakee is All Elite?
No roman wwe need you😭
Cena: 1-2-3 (mic drop)
Oh great so if reigns loses he leaves wwe so that means there's zero chance of cena winning thanks for the spoiler wwe
“I smash em so bad wwe dnt have use for em  anymore “ that part 😂
Woow aew is getting better they got CM PUNK
Now I want Roman to win because it’s not gon be the same with out Roman
that stake raise practically reveals the winner will be reigns
John cena the part timer strikes again taking away titles from guys who wrestle at every show forget about edge he is the real opportunist these days🥱
The views of Smackdown vs AEW Rampage right now on youtube🤣
Roman wants to use the same technique of John Cena. It's failed and he gets tricked by John Cena by knocking down in three seconds quickly 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

JONH CENA 😠😠😠🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
This might have match of the year written all over it 🔥💯
With this ending, with their match at summerslam, I am expected Roman to deliver an AA to Cena and Cena to deliver a spear to Roman.
1:52  ---  Well, Reigns... You were on Hobbs & Shaw.
Roman will be ALLELITE
John cena is my brother and he will destroy roman reigns
Roman: I could go to Hollywood and make movies  John: you can’t the lsat movie you made you ko’d the camera man
ROMAN IS GOING AEW!
If Roman reigns leaves WWE....then they make a big mistake let him go
JONH CENA 😠😠🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
If John won, Roman leaves WWE?! He just got his new theme song like 3 months ago and… I want Roman to win but when Roman said he leaves WWE if he loses, I now feel like…    John is gonna win. 😢
I swear to God if he hyped people up and still lose to roman reigns and later acknowledge him I will be devoted to AEW forever
CM Punk just debuted in AEW
CM Punk! CM Punk! CM Punk!
JONH CENA 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Alright I’m sad to say but now there is no way John Cena is winning 😢😭😤
16×champ big match john💪👌🔥🐐😎
Bye Roman👋
Nadie los vio... El raiting fue en AEW
Thanks for the confirmation that Roman Reigns wins tomorrow lol
Roman can’t loose he’s gonna beat Cena simple 1,2,3😂
Guess Roman’s Leaving
Who wanna make bet? That there gonna let Roman stay champion
John cena 🇨🇱 Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 🇺🇸 chilena corazón 💋💝♥️💖 2021
Roman Reigns on his way to AEW🤣 all part of the script
Welp, we know who's winning tommorow
CM Punk vs Skinny Bootleg Finn  Balor
Roman said if he wins he is still the champ if not he leaves wwe this is crazy but hey John good luck at summer slam
Cm punk cm punk he’s back
Cole trying to say 3 nah buddy
When CM punk goes to aew and now WWE looks like yeh nah  now hahahah
Now it's ovs roman regins is gonna win
If Roman lose leaves from WWE well Roman retains tomorrow, it was beatiful while it last thanks Cena.... All Ellite a space for another One fan?
Cena is losing tommorow for sure and you can belive that!
CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk
Who will win ?
Cm punk is back
Aew was awesome! Cm punk
CM PUNK IS BACK IN AEW
Plot twist Cena wins and Roman writes his name on Cena's movie contract.
A lot of returns happened this past 2 years AEW or WWE they put up the hype
Roman Reigns promo skills have come a long way. His promos are actually good now unlike they were around three maybe two years ago.
Now i know Roman is gonna win wwe will never let Roman leave
What is it with these "I Quit" matches?! WWE doesn't need to lose more Superstars!
Cena the baddest, that won't change.
LET'S GO
Cena will lose in summerslam and will win in another pay per view
The voice of voicless is back , cm punk made his aew debut last night
Its great to see Roman/Cena feud. From Roman learn how to make promo and now , he can make his own promo.
That was so good. Slick. Cena’s the hero we need right now. I hope he gets his 17 tomorrow. He earned it. He carried the company through some pretty crappy times. It was him and Punk, maybe Batista and a few other guys that really carried that roster for years.
CM PUNK IS BACK BICHES😎
Doesn't feel right seeing John Cena back in a WWE ring again for some reason.
They just made this Roman Reigns match even more predictable then before
Im tired of Cena
My gut is telling me that the Head of the Table is going to be removed tomorrow night!
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CM PUNK IS BACK !
Cm Punk is back
Honestly it’s sad thinking this will probably be the last promo we have from John cena in a while cuz now it’s obvious who’s winning
Doesn't hold a candle to AEW Rampage tonight, CM PUNK!
Okay its official Roman reigns is winning as if they'll let him quit
Well, that just confirmed Roman's winning.
Prediction: Roman will dominate Cena almost like how Brock dominated Cena all those years ago
*ELON MUSK JUST TWEETED ABOUT GREENIDGE GENERATIONS & THE $SPRT STOCK!!! GET IN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON MONDAY MARKET OPEN!! ELON MUSK SAID IT WAS THE ONLY GREEN BITCOIN MINER; AND ONLY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED BTC MINER!! I REPEAT ELON MUSK TWEETED ABOUT $SPRT AND GREENIDGE GENERATION MERGER. GET IN ON IT BY MARKET OPEN ON MONDAY!!*
CM PUNK
I’m just gonna say when is ric flair gonna vers the wwe champion an be a 17 time unireversesiol champion
Roman also has an offer from AEW, we will see The Shield in AEW soon.
It's pretty clear at this point Cena is losing
1! 2! 3!
Ok so cena is losing alright.
If cena don’t win I’ll watch aew from now on
Roman Reigns to AEW confirmed! 😂😂
Fully scripted
ROMAN SUCKS
Wow I didn't know you were pinned and kicked out at 2 automatically means you lose
Roma is respecting you Cena
A E W! - C M PUNK Gave out free ice cream bars! And one helluva promo!
CM PUNK ! CM PUNK ! CM PUNK !!! Dude WWE better improve because CM PUNK is back.
Bruh, the USOS got a new theme and u think Roman gonna lose the title….😭 as bad as it sounds, cena ain’t winning unfortunately 😭
My guess is that roman raised the stakes because AEW gave him a better offer. Cena will win but because of romans exit, my guess.
childs play compared to what i saw on aew tonight
If WWE want to make a statement Bring back Brock Lesnar and have him challenge Bobby Lashley after Summerslam, John Cena is a megastar but if John loses it would be awesome to see Brock Lesnar return to face Roman Reigns
Loved Romans facial expressions at the end of Smackdown. For the first time the tribal chief was humilated and he was showing it.
Roman basically just said that he's winning
LMFAO THAT ROLL UP WAS HILARIOUS I CRACKED UP I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA DO AN FU- I MEAN AA
Roman promos aren’t scripted for the most part
AEW HAS PUNK‼️
This is all wwe has and cm punk just came back to aew RIP WWE DEAD ADD WRITERS AND NO TALENT
I just got here from aew lol
Bruh Pat McAfee is the best commentator in wwe rn he is too funny with that 2 and a half second call🤣🤣🤣. I definitely can’t wait to see Cena and Reigns tomorrow🔥🔥🔥
Cm punk
Wow that was 2 and a half but was roman reigns gonna hit the Attitude Adjustment on John you can never hit the AA on John Cena
Thank you for putting Romans career on the line kind of ruined the finish for me tomorrow
Pat McAfee is COMMENTARY & COMEDY GOLD💛
Imagine giving a fruit cake as universal champions blah blah blah !!!
Like how roman relaxes as john speaks ,roman is a good Lister
Cm Punk Cm Punk Cm Punk
CM PUNK!!!!!
And now we know Roman wins
Vince would not let his #1 star leave cmon now
Roll up classic move that never dies
And…. Just like that Roman is 100% winning this
well do anyone still watch wwe? 😂
John Cena got Roman Reigns by the balls so bad he had to put his career on the line.  1 . 2. 3 . Repeat 1.2.3 Repeat.
Cm punk is back
Lol. Reigns is gonna win.
Cm punk cm punk cm punk, vince you are gonna lose, he is in aew and there is no one to blame but you, triple h, and chris amann
Roman can't match Cena on the Mike, it's obvious Roman lost his way in this one it should have been if Roman Wins Cena has to leave WWE
Roman heel is great 👍 this feud this time is dope fr💯💯
Reigns will win
Roman boring reigns . he is awful.
I love the angle, but typical WWE. We know who is walking out with that ugly belt and it won’t be Cena.
Roman Reigns: "I'm leaving as Universal Champion, or I'm leaving WWE"  Spoiler alert: Roman Reigns will continue as Universal Champion
CM PUNK IS AEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 count
So reigns is winning then
Now I know Cena is not winning. WWE aren't going to get rid if Roman.
Reigns will eventually be the only dog in the yard because no one else wants to walk around the turds he and his owner Vince leave behind.
I ain't sure about that tho, I think that 'stakes' just solidifying that Roman is going to win lmao.
Cena Confirm not winning
Roman Reigns > CM Punk
Cena is leaving either way I say Roman remains champ even if it’s with disqualification so cena still gets to look good. If cena wins I give up on WWE! Raw stinks the only good thing about smackdown is the bloodline. All I gotta say is AEW Looking insane right now and if they get Wyatt (who just changed his Twitter handle I might add for everyone speculating he’s still in wwe) they’ll be competition like A MF
Cm punk is all elite
.....CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Show down !
Ok so it's official Roman is retaining his title
I was thinking Cena might win but now there's no way WWE will let Roman lose with the new stipulation.
Cm punk in AEW
Román Reigns is the best, and will retain the universal title
John you are losing at summerslam
Oh well, now reigns is sure to win
Cm puck gonna buss y’all ratings I am a wwe fan since I was 5 I’m 32 now and I stop watching wwe after cm left
I bet Roman feel humiliating after what Cena did to him with the unofficial pinfall.  Cause it'd seems that Roman was wrong about Cena was lying.😁😃🤭 2:35-2:46
A rollup in a promo? 🤣
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITEEE OMFG
John Cena New universal Champion
So basically Roman is gonna win cuz he or they ruined it when he said “ I’ll leave wwe if you win” 💀
I think, who ever return will acknowledge roman, untill brock return, paul heyman will suprise tooo Hahahahaha
John is big mouth, no brains
That was 2
Lol. Cena reminds me of my create a character back in the first smack down and the roll up pin can be used as a finisher
Cena is gonna win tomorrow watch
Now its obvious that roman will retain
Roman can't do a promo.
Cena doesn't have to win, he's been pass the point of his career where he can take any loss and be okay...
Cena is losing 🤦‍♂️, WWE can't release Roman😔
Yup...roman is winning
If he raises the stakes that high, Roman Reigns KNOWS he will win at SummerSlam.
WWE VS AEW
Cena is gonna get beat down like nothing then someone is gonna help cena
Team Roman Reigns were a u
Predictions just went to gutter.. By Roman saying "He'll Quit if he loses" means he's going to win at Summer Slam....
AEW is where it is at right now!
It will be so good if Cena wins. Roman goes and wins the wwe championship from either goldberg or Bobby and they have a Tittle for tittle match Cena wins and passes Ric flair for the most wwe championships and retires
Guys You should watch CM Punk at AEW now
Ladies n gents im callin it. Cena 17th title and then big e retrieves his contract n cashes in and win
"i WoNdEr WhOs GuNnA wIn" 🙄
I can see john lost at summerslam
Then tomorrow we keep hoping for Naomi, Asuka, Liv Morgan, and the return for Becky Lynch! Also the RK-Bro destroying Omos and Styles
CM PUNK
I think roman reigns is going to AEW 😆😆😆😆
Its 2 cena..its 2. That what happen when you didnt go to school
CM Punk Back Aew ☑☑☑☑☑
Ahhh I see John also uses the best finisher in wrestling… surprise pin roll up!!
Seriously .. even if cena win his 17th...cm punk being back again is much better...believe that
I rather watch AEW. WWE dropped the ball not signing Punk.
Spoiler Alert: Ladies and gentlemen, and Your New Universal champion John Cena at Summerslam
COME ON GUYS!!!!!! WE ALL KNOW ROMAN IS GONNA WIN🤦🏽‍♂️ Cena is a part timer....he aint doing wwe full to be the champ besides Roman reigns is the reason why the wwe aint bankrupt...why would they release the person whose rising their rating and putting money in their pockets....I mean come on anytime someone steps up to reigns for the title, its more hyped than bobby lashleys wwe title hence yhe reason why roman is carrying this company....I am a huge cena fan and would love if he wins but it aint gonna happen...t
I hope he doesn’t leave he got me back into wwe
I have a feeling we might be getting a double turn at SummerSlam. In this promo, Cena is acting like a heel by claiming he will walk out on WWE with the Universal Championship and leave the fans without a world champion.
Cena playing the cocky veteran. Saying he's gonna leave with the title until WM38.   Yea he's losing... or he'll win by DQ.  Too much verbal stuff from Cena, he always loses.
I love cena but I hope he doesnt win that 17 now, roman needs one more special w before losing it.
Well now we know who wins because we know wwe ain’t letting Roman go……actually nvm
So Cena is officially leaving
John Cena as Jakob Toretto in F9: The Fast Saga  Roman Reigns as Mateo Hobbs in Hobbs & Shaw
There is no way Roman is going to lose am Cana fan but he going to lose cus Roman won’t leave
Another lame and predictable WWE PPV,Meanwhile AEW is putting excitement back in wrestling. summer of punk>summer of cena
Roman to AEW confrimed?
What got cut out this time
If John Cena blows this win, people gonna hate him
I'M BACK!  -CM punk
Who cares about this match! Everyone was watching AEW and watching CM PUNK’s return!!!!
Roman Reigns  John cena wamnisamn call hall  chipmans tonight
Why do I get a feeling this was done because of a certain thing that happened tonight
CM PUNK
Don't worry there's AEW
Well it’s over cena loss if that’s at stake I want cena to win but probably wont
And any hype I had for this match died tonight. At leastI had the subtle vision that maybe they’d give the win to Cena and then Roman wins it back later but now I know its going to be pointless to watch.
Yet again , Cena outclassed Borin' Reigns in every way Possible 💯
he will leave wwe? dont roman .. dont dare enter hollywood coz i assure u every movie you make is gonna flop like a wizards sleeve
I like this promo better than the one one a week ago Roman finally showed passion & aggression
Switch channels cm punk is back
Cm punk destroyed this already
Ok confirmed Cena will not be 17  time champ cause WWE can't lose reigns
Roman reigns vs cm punk in aew
Look like someone had been training alot.  Get ready, Roman Reigns.  Your second Universal title reign will come to the end.  Go get him, Cena.  Team CENA!!!💁🏽‍♂️😉🗣️
Cena
John Cena sucks
Oh great 😒. Now it's obvious who's going to win. The boring title reign continues. Smh 😒
This could be the last time I see Roman Reigns
Ok
This is gonna be The Ultimate Main Event of Summerslam ever!! The Clash of The Titans, The Head of the Table, The Leader of the Cenation John Cena vs Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship and if Roman Loses, he leave WWE
Now we know Roman gonna win cause no way he leave WWE lmfao🤣
you really can do movies roman .. dwayne is there to back you up remember
he started counting late but LOL
Roman be peeking at AEW
Tommorow summerslam will be a lot of cm punk chants for sure
his cap still there
Perfect match of thy i would love both do submission special maneuver please
They just told you Cena’s losing 🤦‍♂️
Yeah but now we just know that Roman is gonna win...however John cena was in this position at some point in his career, possibly 2011 I think where he said he was leaving but never did sooo yeah....
Roman leaving wwe? well it's a shame but we know Vince's sugargirl will never say that in a promo if they planned he to lose...
John Cena again w the same promo
If Roman leaves WWE Seth will leave to and going to AEW that means there might be a shield reunion 🙂
Go aew
Bro John Cena cannot beat Roman reings. Is john cena a stupid going ahead and keeps on mumbling 123 123 123 again and again and again. John CENA YOU SUCK AND U CANT BEAT REINGS HE IS SUPERIOR  THAN U ARE SO SHUT U R MOUTH. REINGS FOREVER❤️❤️❤️
Wwe officially lost, CM Punk is back on AEW.
Smackdown and AEW are carrying the wrestling industry right now, and RAW is just kinda there
Awesome WWE Friday Night SmackDown Showing Tonight WWE,This Was Truly Legendary Man!!🙌🙌🙌😎😎😎🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🏆👑❤️🎉☺️☺️
Rumor has it that  he came up with that stake to threaten Vince because they wanted John Cena to win.
Who saw cm punk return 🥺
Who cares, CM Punk is in AEW
🤣🤣
WWE has to stop playing on the viewer's feelings once and for all
My anxiety is through the roof with this match 😂
Well they just lost me. Roman can’t leave WWE unless they pull a summer of Punk and he returns less than 2 weeks later
That's why they release ric flair for john cena to beat the record it all interconnect
Roman is gonna win 😭 and y’all don’t realize it
I think cena will win and roman will leave for a while who agree with me?
Absolutely ridiculous!!!!! Cena isn't winning.  I hate that the outcome isn't in doubt but all through the match every mark in the crowd will actually believe Cena might win. Sad!!!!
Roman is gonna win now after saying that
CM PUNK IS BAAAAAAACK IN AEW WOOOOOOW
CM PUNK RETURNS!!!!
If cena loses the match that hype and build up is gonna be for nothing, and don’t do it at another pvp
Raise the stakes? More like just made it easier to know who's walking out as champion. This the same stuff Brock did when he was force to defend his title in a fatal 4 way at ss
I would hate for Cena to win tomorrow.  It would ruin Roman's character.
Cena lost. Whoever gets the upper hand on the go home show always ends up loosing 😭
Ik this is t the point but the theme song for SummerSlam is Up? Did not expect that to happen.
50% of comments: "He kicked out of 2 and a half i think, but sure, point taken." 50% of comments: CM punk related 0% of comments: Is Roman planning on leaving WWE and this is how he's going to do it, he's a heel but he's one of the best and made a huge impact on WWE
when I got off work i forgot to check out smackdown highlights cuz I was watching aew rampage highlights till now,aew is on another level starting tonight
A promo segment featuring a distraction finish followed by THE MOST DEVASTATING MOVE IN SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT, THE SUPRISE ROLL UP!!!  Cena has been clearly doing his homework watching ups and downs, so he can win the Universal Title, break the record, then Simon Miller can look at the situation and go "Why? (Slaps head, then claps, repeats 10 times, clicks fingers and points to us with the finger of power) HERES WHY!!!"
Super cena bs
The end of The Tribal Chief Universal Championship reign is about to begun
Cm punk
Why am I feeling that this Summerslam is more shocking and intense than Wrestlemania 37? I feel that Becky will return while Nikki, Rhea, and Charlotte are fighting on ring. Then, Bayley would return while Sasha and Bianca are fighting on ring. These would be RIDICULOUS!!!!😱😎🤓💥✨
2:23 WHAT WOW!!!!
Por lo visto, Reings retendrá el título.
So it's confirmed, Roman is winning tomorrow.... so predictable 😂😂
they ruined the match i know now whos going win roman is going win cause nothing is wrong with him so dont excpet jhon to win btw
It's too predictable. Cena isn't winning for sure.    WWE can swerve us like they used to.  But nice build up
They’re taking the piss. We really going to have Cena win a HISTORIC 17th title……  …….with a surprise roll up.
This "gimmick" and any amount whatever irrelevant relevancy John thinks he has with this "feud" with Roman, to say it's beyond stupid and ridiculous is literally just that. Stupid and ridiculous. All this shows is how desperate wwe is to have any type of opponent for Roman, and to give John any cling of hope, thinking he can beat Roman, and that is hilarious.
If cena loses give the crown to aew 🤷🏾‍♂️
What a night for pro wrestling fans!  You know what I’m talking about.
Big feeling John Cena is going to lose again to Roman reigns. Though, it’s going to be good entertainment
If either of them leave they,ll now be too  old to rejoin in NXT! Is it called  a promo now John?
It’s the beginning of the end.
The real reason Ric Flair left WWE and he was mad John Cena is gonna break his record.
Cena just says he gonna be at wm next year?
No one cares WWE. CM Punk is on AEW!!
Roman's a heel, alot of legends are back and also CM punk is back even though I don't watch aew, the world is getting great again and wrestling is great again. Ladies and gentlemen wrestling is great again🤣😂✌✌.
If Cena wins roman leaves wwe which opens up to Brock Lesnar and Paul working together again bobby vs Brock.
Bro CM Punk returning to wrestling and John VS Reigns are literally highlighting this week.
Damn I need to.se.that tomorrow
He kicked out a 2 1/2 I counted LOL 💯 😂
Ok, if they hate the head of the table and love cena. Me, heyman and roman will go to AEW. Because WWE is getting cheesy.
John Cena, CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE!
Why can't roman reigns go back to the Babyface he was before he turned heel last year at SummerSlam 2020
From when he said he's either gonna walk out of SS the universal champion or he leaves the WWE, the fix is in for him to retain the universal championship.
Thanks for the video
I hope Cena loses and either Corbin or Big E cash in and beats Roman🤣🤣🤣
Wait romans going to aew tooo????
CM Punk is All Elite
thanks to ROMAN REIGNS 1..2..3..!!!
1, 2, 3 - TEAM CENA FOR THE WIN
CM PUNK AEW
Who actually gives a damn here, CM Punk is back on AEW!
Roman Reigns to AEW confirm 😂😂😂😂
Wonder what Vince is gna do now that AEW has CM Punk
I'm a big Cena fan, but Roman is the real deal
.yea that tells you roman will win they make it obv. We already know the dream match between roman and the rock so..ofc his not going to leave wwe
Vince: man I dont want cena to lose in his big main event Match :( Also Vince: Dont leave romaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
Bye..... bye Roman!
I belive juicy will win
“1 2 3” that should be one of his new catchphrases
Roman to AEW confirmed
Cole counted late
yeah so romans 100% gonna win bc of what he said
1:08 cena basically gonna turn into lesnar
I WWE is awesome buddy
So they kinda confirmed Reigns would win? You know their not gonna let Reigns go. There goes my Saturday night
WWE washed, hood watches AEW now 🥱
I love Roman Reign my favorite dude also i like Cena🤣
Once again john got into Roman's head with little to no effort
CM PUNK SUMMER
Bro, when Pat said “he kicked out at 2 and a half but point taken!” at the end, 😂😂😂
When roman said that if he lose he will leave wwe he's clearly gonna win this sunday
This is nothing on cm punk returning
Cm punk debut is AEW
Who cares cm punk is back summer of punk !!!
Now roman is gonna win because obviously they wouldn't ditch roman
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK

Well for once, Cena is gonna lose
wwe is the best
Can we get The Rock and Cena mic argument again.
CM PUNK
Cm punk in aew
Who cares??? CM PUNK IS BACK!!!
Yep, Cena has a new Catchphrase.
Roman Reigns makes SmackDown a great show, why would you take the belt off of him, people watch smackdown for Roman Reigns, not a bunch of part timers
this has lost all meaning because Phil Brooks returned the Professional Wrestling
No Roman no.... if...if u loss to john don't leave WWE......  Win him..... Kill him....N Show him the way where he came from.... And stand tall as the UNIVERSAL CHAMPION IN WWE SMACKDOWN....
Big E will cash in money in the bank!
this video 42k Aew video from 20 mins after this 172k
Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk
John will acknowledge Roman just watch
I really don’t want roman to lose this match because or else he will not coming back to WWE 😫
If Reigns wins, Big E cashes in, will Reigns leave?
Wanted Roman to tell Cena you can’t 1.2.3 me.
CM PUNK IS BACK who cares about those two?
Summer of Punk!
Where’s my ice cream bar?
Spoiler alert: CM Punk is on AEW now...
Broooooo the hype for this match is overpowered
Si alguna vez Vince McMahon creó una storyline fingiendo su muerte, esta noche puede ser la ocasión perfecta para volver a hacerlo... Con el regreso de CM Punk: WWE GAME OVER !!
Who wants to bet that Vince added this stipulation last minute after finding out what happened over in AEW tonight?
Roman Reigns must win!
Why am I watching this Cm Punk is back
Cena will win
How did Johns hat stay on his head through that whole roll up
I smash em so bad that wwe don't have a use for em anymore lol
Wow I wonder who’s gonna win 😐
Aew
👍💪
Romans muscles have gotten larger than cenas
why isnt cena speaking mandarin? wrestling is such a man soap opera.
Ok so now Cena will definitely lose or Cena will win the 17th championship and Roman will be gone but he'll come back because of some loophole if they still have plans for the rock to come back to fight Roman reigns I would have seen a win at SummerSlam and then have the rock come back acting like a great cousin and trying to go over the board and tell them to bring him back for a rematch with John Cena and then you have this back and forth where Roman and The Rock or maybe on good terms and then the rock doesn't like something he's doing or something and they fight each other at WrestleMania!  I'll admit as soon as John Cena made his return like a month ago or whenever it was I immediately thought okay the rock is somehow going to be using this too not because they faced each other but because the Rock is in storyline for Roman reigns he's going to play a big part in this hole storyline with Roman and John Cena how about another scenario I never thought about what if the Rock comes back SummerSlam during the match during a great match or something and helps Roman win that's actually what I expect WWE to do it's another way to keep Roman reigns champion but it's another way to help out the storyline with Roman and The Rock!  The Rock gets his revenge on Cena without having to do much either just distracting them or giving him a rock bottom and not even fight John to lose the Roman and get back at John,Two he helps Roman stay champion and three The Rock says something to Roman like now you owe me one meaning you got to give me an opportunity for that title then I could see him have a promo like okay Roman you think you're the head of this house you think you're the head of the table you think you're the tribal chief time to put it to the test against a grandest of all the real head of the table the real tribal chief!  But of course if this does happen if the Rock is still used in the storyline somehow to Face Roman you have to think the rock is old he didn't have a last great match but he did but he ended up having the stomach issue which could have just been a work to have John win have a reason for John to win but nonetheless I think it would to be to put Roman over and I think if Roman actually beat the Rock it would finally win some fans because he hasn't won a fair fight yet he hasn't beaten anyone fair yet there's been controversy literally in every big fight he's either needed Paul Heyman to help him by distraction or something, his cousins to help him, he's needed to injure guys or attack an already existing injury and believe me I know even the good ones do it John Cena has attacked someone with an existing injury to win even when he was still face he did it everybody's done but when it's a heal it looks worse then you even had controversy like Seth Rollins helping him!
So we all know Roman winning here...
no guys imagine this, what if roman reigns really lose to cena for the universal championship and then cena go back to hollywood until wrestlemania, and then smackdown held a tournament for new universal champion and then the shocking turn of events is roman reings won that tournament because he sign a new contract with wwe, or he go to raw and sign a new contract and then cena return to wrestlemania to have a undisputed wwe universal championship match, it will become a really long storyline!
Well I will call it now Roman win retain the title and Goldberg will win the wwe title Vince will not let Roman walk out of the company
i can't wait to see Roman lose.  God its gonna be good
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
ruined the match, sigh. Cena gone then
Am legit crying right now... Thank you AEW, Thank You Tony Khan, For bring back CM PUNK BACK HOME TO PROFFESIONAL WRESTLING !!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Leaves Roman leaves ....l won't watch WWE at all
That’s 3
definitely watched the CM punk return before coming here.
Hopefully John Cena wins 🙏🏻💪🏼💪🏾🔥
ROMAN REIGNS IS SPEECHLESS
Roman raising the stakes kinda shows us that he’s gonna end up winning, they’re not about to let cena win and loser smack downs main star
Team Roman 4 life
I hate John cena 😐🔫
Can't wait for tomorrow
shoutup Cena,
John CENA IS CONFIDENT TO WIN ON THIS MATCH
Well we all know Roman will be retaining now.. lmao.
Wait if Roman reigns loses tomorrow will he leave ?
My two favorite wrestlers 😭
I’m kinda getting sick of this 123 thing
Talk about spoilers, now we know Cena won’t get the belt🤦🏾‍♂️
"When people step in the ring with me. I smash them and WWE doesn't have a use for them anymore " RIP CESARO
John Cena beat roman
John Cena 🔥🔥 never give up 🤘🤘❤️❤️ From Nepal ❤️
It's clear to everybody that every time Roman needs to make a huge promo, intense one, on Cena, he forgets the lines hahahhahah 2017 and now 2021.. hahahah
"Because when people step in the ring with me, I SMASH EM so bad, the WWE dont have a use for them anymore", that's kinda sus Roman😳😳😳
Well great, now we know Roman is winning tomorrow 🤦🏼‍♂️
It’s obvious that Roman is goin retain. Bc if he leaves then it’ll be cena vs fin. But that rival isn’t goin last long and when Roman retains he  has to fight fin. Which fin might win.
If Cena wins I will only watch AEW
same old cringey cena
Roman don’t leave wwe you the best and I know you can beat I him and also compunk is back in aew
If Cena don’t win they gonna need the rock to come back to bring WWE back to life cause I’m tired of Roman so much I rather cena win his 17th
Roman better win I don’t want him to leave if he loses it he should at least come back and reject Paul Heyman and go back to his big dog gimmick
Cm punk is AEW
That’s how you know Roman is winning this match, he’s not going anywhere
Stakes raised, so Cena is going to lose at Summerslam 😕
john will win a roman will come back at rumble win then they wrestle at wrestlemania
Well now the result is more obvious with what roman said, vince wants the rock to dethrone reings
Lmao imagine cena wins and and next friday reigns comes to aew
CM Punk went to aew sucks to be the WWE
summerslam prediction .. lesnar comes back lol f5 cena and reigns and then big e cashes in and wins.... goldberg lashley.. lashley wins lol
Bruh that’s annoying they gonna make Roman win now if John cena wins I’ll very surprised I’ll be happy tho i kinda want John to win but don’t want Roman to leave
Roman will win
i hate to say it but summerslam tomorrow came at a wrong time after what had happened tonight. Idk if people gonna focus on tomorrow anymore

Cena should win this match. This would be amazing if cena wins.
ROMAN REIGNS AEW DEBUT CONFIRMED
Because Roman put that condition on himself, means that he will win.
Well that just confirms the result then
I would like Roman to say that if Cena lose he can't challenge for any world title and been stuck in 16
Wat
This has certainly been an interesting week for wrestling
Who's here after cm punk camed back but if it was in WWE smackdown or raw imagine
Imagine if Survivor series featured aew wrestlers VS wwe wrestlers
Good job giving away tomorrows finish WWE. Now we know for sure Reigns wins. So dumb
Wonder if Roman needs a vacation
But I’m sacred now. Since Roman said he’d leave if he loses that kinda hinted me that Cena may not win this match! 😱 but Cena still needs to win. Because if he wins the title than that’s a 100% guarantee that Cena is now once again a full timer!
A certain individual name CM Punk is back in AEW. We living in 2011 again: Cena Edge Orton Rey Punk Big Show Christian
welp...bye roman..damn
Ñ
John Cena vs Roman Reigns for the Universal championship at Summerslam will be the memory of Summerslam
Im predicted Corbin cash in tomorrow and John Cena win the universal championship by pinning Corbin . And after that Cena Will have a rematch against Roman reigns at Extreme Rules while Baron Corbin have a rivalries with Big E
Seeing AEW and WWE fanboys clashing it out while me in the side enjoying both shows ☕
Paul heyman turn on roman, John cena turn heel
Rampage was Better
Well now we all know roman is obviously going to win
Yooo CM Punk just returned to AEW
Who came to check the comments after CM Punk returned?
It shocked me when Roman said he will either leave as universal champion or leave WWE
Who gives a f*** CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!!!!!!!
Finn balor is gonna cost Roman .
You gana see jhon
Who cares !!!!! CM PUNK RETURNED TONIGHT !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 AEW 😎
"Smackdown no longer has a resident champion until wrestlemania"   Wait what?
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
Cm punk on AEW
Disculpen estadounidenses como no hacen en español mucho  Es muy grande el pinche cena 👏
Okay, now the match is more predictable.
CM punk is back Vince McMahon how your feel about that
Sorry wwe but you lost when cult of personality played on aew tonight
2:37 thought he was going for an AA
What's that for a stake? It's a spoiler
Roman Reigns says he might leave WWE they either not gonna make that happen or put somebody else on Cena's radar if he wins.
Where is Cersaro?
YAY I HOPE JOHN WINS TOMORROW. I REALLY HOPE. GO CENA!👏👏👏 TEAM CENA!!!!!!🥰🥳🤩 BUT I BET CENA IS GOING TO WIN BC I READ SOMETHING ABOUT ROMAN WANTING TO RETIRE SO HE CAN SPEND TIME WITH HIS FAMILY BUT I HOPE CENA WINS
Cena isn't good enough to win the Universal Championship
Yo seriously John where is the old John Cena enough with the wrapping bro bring the Marine back
Poor wwe has to contend with aew and cm punks debut
Cena got the last laugh before the PPV so Cena is losing (WWE Logic)
Cool wwe
HAHAHAGA John
CM PUNK IS ON AEW!!!
Roman Reigns will retained his Universal CHAMPIONSHIP tomorrow 🌃 at Summer Slam.
Actually, most people were more focused on CM Punk's debut than this segment.  We all know that Roman will win tomorrow and therefore this match is no longer interesting.
Roman will win
Man like Aew in 1hr n 2 minutes was 1zillion times better than raw 3hrs. Or Smackdown in2 hrs. Smackdown. N the whole wwe.got.smacked. only thing that barely make wwe tie aew is if vince can get Seth 2 be adopted 2 the bloodline otherwise wwe out of business all there stars come 2 aew lol bro 😆
Yawn
The writing doesn’t give justice to John Cena’s talent in this scenario, it’s unfortunate to watch his last promos in this storyline, I’m disappointed
I like the fact that Cena basically said that he's willing to win no matter what it takes. Cena's given credit to Roman -- admitting that, when Roman is at his best, he stands no chance against him. But a distraction, a mistake, or anything less than Roman's best gives Cena an opportunity. He even showed that he's not above a cheap rollup pin for the win. Makes you wonder... WWE wouldn't pull the trigger on Roman leaving -- would they?
1..2..3
this obviously means reigns retains tomorrow night, but its gonna be a hell of a match!
I actually think that wwe is gonna let John win for he can break the record
Tbh wwe is dead now   Aew won they got cm punk
Peacemaker, He doesn’t care how many children and women he have to kill to get it
Well there you have roman wins that tells us everything Vince's new top lap dog
used to be a WWE fan until CM punk came back to AEW today,switched over
cena Sucks
Gonna give credit where it’s due, Roman Reigns promos are better because of this feud
Great that Cm Punk is back ✌️💯
Cm punk return to AEW 🔥 Roman reigns beats John Cena but Brock lesner returns and Paul heyman  betrays roman so Brock and heyman
WWE lowkey just trying to re-record fans counting “1..2..3” for WWE 2k22
Damn... cena be out here teaching ppl how to count to 3.
CM PUNK...hit “like” so I know that WWE didn’t censor this comment 👀
cm punk tho...
Roman will realese by wwe may be .........   This week aew makes high ratings CM punk makes his debut    This is the spoiler of wwe
John cena2021 champ
Roman saying he will leave the wwe if he Lost just mean he will win tomorrow.
I'm going for team CENA
Oh yeah…WWE exists.
If he leaves bruh an other AEW spot 🤷🏾‍♂️
CM PUNK COMING BACK KILLED THIS STORYLINE AND MATCH LOL
"He kicked out of 2 and a half i think, but sure, point taken." Pat is so hilarious in these days on smackdown.😂😂
noone  can do promo better than John Cena. He is legend
CM PUNK
So Roman Reigns is winning then? 🙄  I hate these kind of stipulations because there's no way that he's leaving WWE is there?
Michale cole counted to Late🤦‍♂️
Cm punk is back BayBay!!!
So they have just cemented the result with Roman winning by adding that extra stipulation.
Team John Cena all the way
This goes to show that Roman Reigns will winn this Sunday and the fans will chant CM Punk in SummerSlam all night long. CM Punk! CM Punk! CM Punk!
On the mic cena says things barely any superstars would say on tv or mic
CM Punk CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Hoy nada de wwe hoy AEW CM PUNK de regreso te lo perdiste wwe ya nadie quiere ver wwe por las estupideses de darle la espalda a luchadores que lo dieron todo por wwe
Who else saw that sign "Thanks WWE, We wish you well in all your future endeavors." Kinda poetic...
Roman jumping ship to AEW after loosing to Cena...!!!
Roman debuts to AEW………………………………………
Tomorw win Hade of the Teble Roman Reigns   Love from Nepal
Woulda been cooler to see Punk crash these guys party, not gonna lie, but a little T shirt company called AEW got that.
The Fiend returns at Summerslam the fiend sights on Roman reigns
“Either I’m leaving that stadium, as the universal champion… or I’m leaving wwe.” I didn’t expect that…. But still, Roman’s reign, will continue…
CM PUNK IS BACK
Cm punk>>>>
admit it ,vince it is time to bring back attitude era
If it wasn't obvious enough that Roman was going to win, it certainly is now. If anything Cena should be the one to put his career on the line to make this more interesting. No point watching this.
Can we just get a Heel Cena like we did with The Rock and Stone Cold please Randy Orton started as a Heel but turn face everyone still love him either way do the same with Cena
Did John just confirm he'll be at WrestleMania next year?
Roman sounds like a sore loser
roman is son of wwe so leaving is a joke. cena lose. spoiler.
Nice they confirmed Roman would win awesome
I was actually thinking reigns was going to say either I leave as the universal champion or I leaving the wwe and I thought he was going say the same goes for John cena either John leaves as universal champion or cena leaves wwe
Paul you know what to do
CM PUNK IS BACK LOL  DO NOT CARE FOR THIS MATCH IF LIKE CENA STILL
reigns will win...
I did care abt this storyline but now I care about the return of cm punk
Am a big fan of cena but I don't think he will win but good luck to him still
I wish there were 3 matches John Cena vs Roman Reings vs Brock Lesnar
actually after roman said he will leave if he lose it makes me so confident that cena will win they trying to make another cm punk vs john cena money in the bank 2011 match
Ok this was just a spoiler that cena will lose
That’s just spoiling Summerslam lol. Roman ain’t leaving.
Well that’s does it Ik Roman reigns is gonna win because Roman has more of a future then cena but if John Freaking Cena beat Roman I’m never watching wrestling again until Roman is back
Fire Roman Reigns for good!
plz give us dr thuganomics plz
So what roman really means is he leaves for a bit and comes back with a face character right got ya
Cm Punk Debut on AEW!!!
Well this confirms reigns is winning but then i feel like they’ll have a rematch or even a triple threat between reigns vs cena vs balor
Cm punk return AEW
I love their storyline, buy Pat is a legend on the mic as well 😭
سينا خسران خسران 😂
Props to McAfee, always calls out a botch
Nah the shoulders we're down for three
Simon miller it looks like romain going to lose to the most devasting move in all of sports entertainment
It's not quite CM Punk though is it
well roman isn't leaving the WWE so... he wins right? nice spoiler guy!
I think the extra stipulation makes no sense, because the outcome is obvious... Roman is going nowhere, so that leaves with him winning the Championship...
Roman tried to do a AA XD
This is all bullcrap. Cm punks return in aew wrestling will burn wwe down
Vince is not going to let his Husband Roman leave WWE
I hope John cena will win at summerslam
Doesn’t feel like summerslam season
Imagine if Cena actually have a heel turn at summer slam
This was badass
This might ruin it or make it better but what if no one wins the match because the rock returns and causes a disqualification
I'm a roman fan if he lose I'm never watching we again
Get out of here Michael Cole that was a 2 count I hate when he always try to change it up same thing happen when Roman fight edge at money in the bank Roman kick out at 2 in a half and he was like that was a 3 count
They made the match too predictable. Now everyone knows that Roman is going to win. So stupid.
yea cena is losing its no way they letting roman regins go lmaoo
I can tell the attitude of the doctor of thuganomics is coming back....
Here come part timer if cena win it’s fcked up, cena will be there for temporary and go back to Hollywood
We all know how WWE works by now— Roman will win by DQ
you can see how pumped John Cena is
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Cm punk is back! Come on aew
John Cena keeps saying the same thing over and over again but yet he talks about Roman being boring but he’s the boring one
Cm punk
This time wwe losses to aew
Roman is All Elite
Roman came a long way with the promos
If roman leave I go watch aew
A 17 spining belt for cena
aew cm punk ha ha
He kicked out!!
*CM Punk is back. John Cena is back. This is great for wrestling. WWE creatives will now be forced to give us great content if they don’t wanna lose this new WWE & AEW war. I know Vince’s genius rises in situations like this. Wrestling fans won tonight*
Roman is obviously retaining... There's no way Reigns is leaving.. Also I dont think Wwe will let Cena break Flairs record at the expense of the Tribal Chief
Roman Reigns is All Elite.
I'm having this feeling that Roman will beat John Cena and just maybe, maybe The Fiend will return as revenge for what Roman did to him last year
Cena going for the unofficial pin was pretty funny.
Who cares, Punk is back
Yeah nah cm punks return was still more exciting
dont care
Looks like the authority for both them to have freedom in speech had been continue in this week as well. Great for us fans.
Sebo
That was good, really good stuff…. Still not better than “CM PUNK TO AEW CONFIRMED!!!!!”
Legends!!!
cm punk is back but in another show.
If Cena is gonna be a full timer again(which I really hope he is🤞) he NEEDS to win this match! Because there’s no sense of hyping up Cena’s return this much if he’s going to lose his first match back. So he needs to win! So he has to win! He better win!
Well Roman is winning
Goodbye Roman
Roman wins huh. If they smart they make him lose to draw people into the story
Boring..boring..boring..Better watch cm punk on AEW.. 🤣🤣
Well Roman you was in F&F Hobbs and Shaw movie for a cameo/side character. That’s a start for ya lol.
Cena will loose for sure
Well..... we now know whos winning 😒🤦‍♂️ like wtf would they even ruin it by roman saying that tf?!?! anyway AEDUB was interesting asf

CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
Roman needs to win then
Can’t wait for tomorrow's match it's going to be great!
no way Vince is gonna get rid of Roman
Cm punk is all elite
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
AEW just made a stand tonight for a new era
They will likely have cena winning to make it the headlines instead of punk. And with that, Roman leaves, meaning....Roman to AEW confirmed
Well I know who's winning that match...
I kinda think cena gonna win
WWE feels so lame because how dry the audience is, CM Punk is All Elite
Roman really wants that free ice cream bar in Chicago that he’s threatening to leave if he loses ay 😂🤷🏼‍♂️😬
Cm punk is back
wrestling is fake and boring 😴 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Well now we know Roman gonna keep his belt for sure
Cm punk debut in aew
He's back cm puck is all elite
Cena having that title I'm done 👌💯
don't forget wrestling is fake you know that right nerd 🤓 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Roman will retain... WWE not stupid to make Roman lose and leaving WWE in this difficult time...or Mcmahon has lost his brain to do that
BUT I dont understand if roman was lying
Roman is guaranteed to win now coz there is no way they are letting Roman leave as 25% of viewers statistically came back to wwe after Romans return in wwe
Cena sounding like a pastor
YOOO! If Roman loses we all know he is going to AEW!!
cm punk AEW
So Roman wins at SummerSlam got it
Cena gonna lose…. I can already see it.
Cm punk aew debut is better
CM Punk just took all the momentum away from Summerslam by joining AEW. Here's hoping WWE wrestlers get better work conditions and more respect. Competition is good.
Apologies my maths is a bit questionable so just a little help: how many seconds does it take to win via a pinfall in wrestling??? 🤔🤔😬🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Roman got real bold this week 💅🏾
In other news, CM PUNK HAS RETURNED TO PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING AT AEW RAMPAGE!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Ugh Roman is pulling a Brock Lesnar he did the same thing a few years ago
Roman about to finish the job Bloodsport couldn't on Peacemaker 😁
Who else ready for summerslam
I was there
Well we know who’s gonna win now
Roman knows Vince still not decided yet. Like the taker and Brock match. This was probably a shoot From Roman side. Damn WWE got start making choices..
Bruh Roman already spoils the result at Summerslam
Moxley called. He said he wants his brother back.
Xd
HAHAHAHA IF CENA WINS WE WILL NOT SEE THE UNIVERSAL TITLE TILL WRESTLEMANIA 🤣🤣  Edit: Cena will not win it tho.
Cm punk cm punk cm punk
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK...🎉🎉🎉 AEW Arrives .......in 1 2 3 ..... ALL OUT..  THE PUNK IS HERE...... #⚡MORETNTRAMPAGE⚡ CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK....  ARRIVES . BEST IN THE WORRRL!! 🤨
This build has been absolutely fantastic, but we all know Reigns will Win. I just hope it's a dirty finish for Cena to lose clean. Damn, never thought I'd say that in my life...
I like roman but like he turned rude but John  is pretty rude to roman ngl but still Roman kinda deserves it
Road wife reunion coming soon. Only on PPV.
Like CENA said one mistake 123!! While roman reigns tried the AA he got pinned 123🤣🤣
Why is everyone talking about CM punk? Is it because Roman was about to give a GTS to cena?
2:22 well it's your fault that you leave Daniel Bryan...
Who cares, cm punk IS BACKKK!!
CM FREAKING Punk is BACK on AEW!!!
CM Punk just demoted both of u
In my opinion. It's gonna be same script like 2017. Cena wins at provoke,  roman wins the games
Cena with the same promo.....
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE 🤯
Rock will interrupt. Roman win. Rock vs roman
BIG MISTAKE, ROMAN!
CM PUNK has arrived !!! …  Oops.. wrong channel 😆
2:40 I know people are sick of the roll up, but that was awesome. This show was brought to you today by the number 3.
Meanwhile in AEW CM Punk is back!
I will say this was a great promo from both of them. To me cm punk return to aew is bigger.
Well WWE going to be boring if roman leaves WWE🤷🏽 welp time to see roman go to AEW💪🏼🔥
1 2 3😂😂😂😂
I had the hope of cm punk appearing at summerslam and face cena or the tribal chief, but now I feel son sad 😖😖😖
This can only mean one thing... Wwe buys Aew
If John cena beat Roman and if he leaves I think edge is gonna to face John cena
Roman cousins gone come in and save the day for him🤣 I’m callin it
Amazing. Roman is still gonna win. The rock is gonna interrupt to give roman a win. And it's going to start a feud Rock vs roman
CM PUNK TO AEW CONFIRMED
Roman is going to win they Did The same Rivalry before john cena kept winning the promo's And Roman wins the Match  authority That's what's best for Business they say
John cena: I’ll jump the barricade, run up the ramp and may even blow you a kiss (cm punk reference) Cm punk: Welp time to debut on AEW
Team cena   like Team regins comments
I can’t imagine SmackDown without Roman Reigns.
This literally confirms romans winning they not taking the title off roman
CM Punk is back no one cares
I wonder who people want more?  CM Punk or Roman Reigns?
"He kicked out at 2 and a half but point taken!" I love this dude 😂😂
Y'all better bring a 5 star show tomorrow at Summerslam, because CM Punk just broke the internet. 😭🤣
Tbh I feel like John Cena is too over confident
Roman needs to win.
Roman Leakee is All Elite
Welp looks like Roman is winning again 😭, should be a good match nonetheless
Team regins   like Team cena      comments
Cm punk!! Cm punk!! Cm punk!!
Tbh I feel like John Cena is too over confident
WTF
was reigns trying to use attitude adjustment?
John Cena will make Roman Reigns leave WWE
It was two John can’t count
If it wasn’t more obvious Romans going over 🤦🏾‍♂️
Hey Roman, 1...2...3...
Lmfao Roman just spoiled the match, he ain’t going anywhere he is all WWE got right now 🤣
Ouch… sorry to say this, WWF/WWE will always stay in my heart, but AEW is where its at if ur a real pro wrestling fan
Now we're 100% sure roman is winning. There's no way Vince gonna let Roman leave 😂🤣🤣
welp. there goes the spoiler. it was kindof unpredictable on whos gonna be the winner here, thought they gon give cena the 17 time champ. but nope since roman raised the stakes by him leaving wwe if he loses thr belt, then 99.9% sure roman will retain.
16 mins, early gang
Soooo, what Cena is saying is that he's gonna hijack the title like Lesner and not show up unless he has an availability in his schedule? I think it's time we look at who the real heel is here.
"Roman Reigns is all elite"
L WWE W AEW, Ngl Cm Punk is in AEW that just proves WWE production is terrible and they need to wake up and do better
Cena made a spoiler by say Wrestlemania... We can be sure he will be there next wrestlemania but not as a champion, he will return to face who ever is the champion by this moment and win his 17x time champion
CM Punk Is back, babe!!!!
Undartaed_lorchris 🔥🔥🔥
WWE
Cm punks aew debut was better than this whole show
WE ALL KNOW ROMAN REIGNS GONNA WIN🔥
Believe me, John Cena have repeated the 123 thing more than once and that means he’s gonna form the nWo after the match at SummeSlam.
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
I had to catch this on YouTube, because I want to watch CM Punk on Live TV.
John Cena and Roman Reigns never disappoint in their feuds together
Honestly....I really want Roman to win,it's not that I don't like Cena,I like him...but I acknowledge our Tribal chief,can't wait,,we'll never be disappointed🥰🥰🥰
CM PUNK
👍🇵🇦😎👊🏅🥇🥈🎤🎙🏆🏆🎖🎉🎊👑🤜🗣
Roman's gonna gone for 2 weeks and he'll be back. That's a tip-off
CM PUNK IS BACK
Roman Joke 👍
Roman got pinned at 2 in a half but honestly I hope roman reigns wins wrestlermainia
That was barely 2 lol
CM punk is ALL ELITE
goddamnit now he’s guaranteed to retain that title i think cena is only here to make finn balor look good after summerslam
So Vince released bray to give cena more mic time on tv
All it takes is 1.2.3
😂😂 Roman wooden asf his delivery on the mic is still shocking.
If Roman leaves does this mean he is all elite na jk Roman ain’t leaving in a million years hell na
Hey cm punk debuted btw
CM PUNK is back. RIP WWE😂
We all know Roman is winning
So Reigns is retaining at Summer Slam.    😒😒
Cena just used the most devastating move in all of sports entertainment. Reigns better watch out.
Roman Reigns King 👑.   Jhon cena  nothing 😀😀
Man I love cena
Smack down smashing it out the park every week now cm punk in aew with Daniel Bryan on the way if the rumours are true.... Not looking great for Monday night raw these days 😬😬
Roman tryna go wrestle cm punk in Aew lol
Joe Anoai is All Elite Dec 2021 😆😆
wrestling has never been this good in a long time
Cena looking real old and kind off skinny
💯Roman
CM PUNK ✊🏽 CM PUNK ✊🏽 CM PUNK ✊🏽
Wwe is predictable. But, this match, i really dont know whos winning tommorow
Awesome cena
It's interesting to see that they've raised the stakes because now that Ric Flair is probably heading to AEW and they'll most likely do something to combat CM Punk's debut, they might pull the trigger and give Cena his 17th world title.
Man the AEW guys are so annoying keep talking about cm punk back good for him but no one cares WWE is not go  into disappear because of him
I smash em so bad WWE don't have a use for them anymore...lets see there's Braun,The Fiend, and Daniel Bryan and they all faced this new heel Roman Reigins..damnnnn
2:45 it's fear
These promos have been great, but thanks to the “if i lose i leave wwe”  thing now we all know the result
CM PUNK IS BACKK
I know this off topic but is anyone wondering where finna balor and toni storm are
Roman reigns will win, confirmed ✅  Y'all remember when Brock said the same thing, I believe the fatal 4 way at summerslam too, he said we would leave if he lost, but he won soooo reigns will retain
God this is unpredictable as hell!
Looks like Rome going to Hollywood
after that roman will win and retain universal champion
Nobody care. CM punk is back
Yeah Roman winning, I just think there’s gonna be a shocking thing happening in the match, idk
Cm punk . Cena. Edge.ray.rendy old pro wrestlers is back 🤩
This just ruined the pay per view John isn't going to win now because Roman said he would leave the WWE why would they say that honestly the pay per view is not even exciting now nothing to look forward too
sorry i dont care, cm punk just returned
C...
😴😴😴😪😪😪😴😴😴
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK! oops wrong company
CM PUNK IS AEW 😭
John cenaaa
Coming Soon: JOE REIGNS IS ALL ELITE!
Yeeeeaaaaaaa CM Punk came back tonight y’all got competition fr Smackdown
Someone’s going to screw Cena
NOT EVEN THIS SEGMENT COULD SAVE SMACKDOWN FROM CM PUNK ARRIVAL IN AEW. VINCE MUST BE FLIPPING IN HIS S**T
I’m ready for the match
Cena embarrasses Roman each time they’re on the mic.
Team Cena!!
They just made the result obvious now LMAO
I’m ready!
Cena is winning because all he has to do is 1 2 3 and cena is going to be the new head of the table cena but this match is going to be very good know matter what happens this match will change wwe forever
Man Brood Edge , John Cena , AND CM PUNK❤🔥🔥🔥 WHAT A TIME TO BE A WRESTLING FAN
Cena gonna win at Summer Slam
Said it once, I'll say it again. If The Fiend does not return tomm, then this is the beginning of the end for WWE.
Who cares cm punk is back
This match will be the greatest match of Summerslam tomorrow
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK 🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶
😂😂😂😂😂
Who’s better at promos Cena Or Reigns.
I really like how Cena is getting up under Roman's skin
Dont like this, kinda gives away the result. Still excited tho.
And there you ppl WWE creative so stupid this was not needed clearly show whoa winning
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
CM PUNK
CM PUNK!
Team John Cena
I have a feeling Big E will cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at SummerSlam
Cmon man, Cena needs to win his 17th world title... why would you stick the record to Ric Flair when he left WWE for other promotions... ?
Idk if it just me but this feud has been trash. Roman look weak this whole feud.
Cena is a loser and the biggest butt kisser ever because we all know that cena cant win because he has lost to Roman so many times 👏👏👏
I bet they r gonna tie then more BS will happen till Cena wins the rumble and beats Reigns at Dallas Wrestlemania
These promos have the rap battle feel to them lol
You all know CM PUNK is back?
If Roman leave wwe, he is all elite.
I can't wait FOR SUMMERSLAM
I saw
Roman leaving might just be part of a storyline.
Thanks for spoiling who’s winning tomorrow night.
Yeah anyways... Cm punk is back
Well thanks WWE for making it obvious who’s going to win tomorrow
"1 2 3"- JOHN CENA
Now Roman Reigns will win 1000%
Battle of Hollywood.
Roman should lose and come back at royal rumble. Or win and face lashley at survivor series. I’m good either way
YOU CAN'T SEE ME!!!
Roman is all elite
Whoa! John Cena is gonna demote Roman Reigns in 0:26. Best damn week of my life. 😎👏. Roman Reigns gives his stake to John Cena if he lose the Universal Championship, he will leave WWE. 2:18. As for the hand shake, Roman Reigns steals Cena's Attitude Adjustment and failed. 2:34. He ask for it.
F that, CM PUNK IS BACK
Reigns still don't have what it takes to toe to toe with Cena
1 2 3
wow its gonna be breathtaking match.... Go Roman💪💪💪💪
John cena is definitely gonna win at summerslam Roman Reigns can’t leave wwe 😭
Well, thats Roman winning for sure 😂😂 He ain't goin nowhere 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody is winning. Brock is returning
Takeover will still be better
Roman beat John before and he will do it again tomorrow he will be leaving Summerslam still your universal champion. 1:36 listen closely.
This is gonna be a match
So predictable.... WWE won't let Roman Reigns go. So already congratulations on retaining the title at SummerSlam, Roman 👍
That was not a 3 count but ok 😂😂😂
Ah who cares CM Punk is in AEW
1-2-3
Mean while in AEW...
Welp, now we all know who’s winning.
Cmpuk returns omg
John cena....  😍😍😍😍😍
CM Punk in AEW Rampage - Awesome  Summerslam 2021 - Irrelevant
Now I'm not sure if Cena's winning. No way they're letting Roman leave. Either Roman wins or he loses, but ends up returning anyway
Too bad you gonna lose Cena
CM PUNK!!!!!!!
I think roman wins
can you please shutup
CM PUNK IN AEW!!!
Roman ganador
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
Cm punk is back and wwe is dead
Sorry didn't saw this, too busy awaiting CM Punk
Either Roman retains or goes into DQ, probably by Balor
Now you know Roman won´t lose but, we can be sure someone will return and stop de match... Maybe Lesnar... XD
CM PUNK- CM PUNK - CM PUNK
WWE just killed that small amount of unpredictability of JOHN CENA winning the title.......
CM Punks Comeback puts Summerslam's whole damn show down I swear....I love Cena but god there is nothing else on that card I care to see XD
My boy cena 12 hahaha cena go to win
CM PUNK
John Cena aka Yuan Xina will do anything for the CCP cash.
To be honest, that’s was more 2& a half.
Imagine watching this trash promotion also CM Punk!!!!!!! Aew!!!
Cena
Roman Reigns retaining the title confirmed.
A sign said the tribal Chad lmao
summer of cena that a tip off. - summer of punk begins in aew
if John Chineesena wins the title i am DONE with wrestling
The facts he mentioned leaving makes it clear, that roman is going to win. At this point I really hopenthe mat h is interrupted by balor.
Roman regins is All elite after summerslam
WWE just kind of ruined the hype for match with Roman saying he'll leave if he doesn't retain. Makes it even more obvious he'll win. Still hope that it will be a great match.
I want cena to win, but Roman is definitely winning
Roman: " I'm either walking out still Universal Champion, or I'll leave WWE."   Months later.....  "The Chief of the Tribe" Leakee is ALL ELITE
John Cena will avoid Roman Reigns spear and push through the turnbuckle tommorow and win
I was there it was fun
I can't wait until roman reigns is going lose to John cena and leave wwe for good and never come back forever
Roman will win. Cena gone again. The Rock comes in for the Head of the Table family fued.
I love you cena but I want Roman reigns to win because I don’t want him to leave wwe
a cult of personality is back
Thats cool but cm punk is back
John cena is gonna loose
everything about this was amazing
Hi
Roman wins
He use cm punk Reference promo if he wins the Champion
Anybody here after Cm Punk on AEW 👀
Never give up john cena 💪 👍
Listen they just might put the title on  John Cena  just To screw Rick flair And so they can say that they have their guy with the most world title record
Roman Reigns my faforit head of the table
I could see cena winning and copying what punk did in 2011 so people can stop talking about cm punk returning but nothing can top cm punk returning it was historic
This is nice and everything but CM PUNK IS BACK!!!
cena first ever pins roman reign
THE BEST IN THE WORLD IS BACK!!!!
John cena is better than roman reigns
Dude! The wrestling world is on fire! Any fan of WWE or AEW or Both... Should be hyped for all this! It is good to love Wrestling right now! :D
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!!!
John cena got to be careful what he gets hisself into this is not the same Roman reigns from no mercy 2017
Cm punk!!!!!!!!

Roman is the modern day The Rock
John cena is going to be the new universal championship
Cena wins it all plus u cant pin someone when its not even a match john but it was funny
Cm punk is back
I feel like they're gonna have cena loose so he can stay and have a rematch at another ppv but this is their biggest ppv yet
Team Cena 100%
🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾 So Roman is gonna walk out as Champ🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Hey Vince. With Punk in AEW and that promotion packing a building y’all pack (something TNA couldn’t do) it’s time to get more serious. Like you did with WCW. I want to feel like I was as a kid. I tuned into both you & WCW. I want to have the feel of watching you & AEW. I wanna tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, & Fridays (I left out Tuesday cause I’m focusing on the main shows even though I like NXT). I want that feeling
THATS SAD ROMAN LMAO
John Cena keeps getting the better of Roman every week. I really love this rivalry it's making for a great match at Summerslam
Thanks to Roman Reigns 😂😂😂
Don't let this promo between nepotism incarnate and a CCP bootlicker distract you from the fact that CM Punk just debuted in AEW.
I was expecting their last promo to be epic yet it was kind of stale. Especially since is highly unlikely that WWE will let John Cena take the Universal title from Roman.
Damn he did Daniel bryan dirty
Well now we know Roman will 100 percent win
Finn Balor Heel turn tomorrow night to help Roman Reigns?
CM PUNK CM PUNK
Holy Sh** ROMAN NEEDS TO WIN
No mercy, no liability! Cena, Reigns! SummerSlam! If Reigns doesn’t retain, Reigns is GONE!!!! (as Vic Joseph)
"never give up"  Gives up on Nikki.
John cena 🥰🥰❤ 🤩
John cena could have broken his and Rick flair 16x world championship with 17. The rock and cena could have been 19x or 17x world 🌎 champions
So their match will end with a distraction and with the most devastating move in all sports’ entertainment!
Reigns literally just Said "Ok i'm winning, bye cena" lol
CM PUNK
Well cenas losing due to Romans new stipulation
I just saw this live in Phoenix
Roman was going for a f5
JOHN CENA THE GOAT
Cm punk in aew is the death of anything the WWE has going on sorry
Cena win with the greatest move of all times the roll-up 😂👌
Lowkey given the Punk news… imagine they give Cena the win 😳
Who many time did John say 123
When Roman said he leaves WWE John was laughing
Peacemaker actually doing good for once.
Cm punk is back!
Cm punk returns guys
I like these two guys, but I'm bias. Rooting for John Cena!
What if Cena actually leaves WWE for a few months
Roman Reigns just drop a bombshell
'I smash em so bad that WWE dont know what to do with them anymore' DAMN SAVAGE!
Cm punk 😍
Not gonna lie when Roman added that he would leave WWE if he lost, it made it pretty obvious that he was gonna go over Cena. Still gonna be a dope match either way.
CM PUNK IS ALL ELITE
The "I beat them so bad, WWE no longer has a use for them" line was great! The promos have been good but they did not top Cena's promo from their feud in 2017. Still, excited for the match
Heel Reigns vs Cena, Punk return, Becky might return tomorrow.. wrestling never been like this for years 🔥 good job aew, good job wwe (mostly SmackDown, as someone said, and NXT as usual) Keep it coming, Lesnar or Rock coming too we know it
This great watch this tonight? What John did to Roman?123💚💛💙🖤🤣🤣🤣👌👌
CM PUNK IS BACK
1 2 3
3 outcomes at SS 1. Roam beat Cena 2. Match end in DQ or no contest 3. Big E clash in or Corbin?? lol
Wow, the stakes has never been so higher, so if Roman Reigns lose the Universal Championship he will leave WWE
