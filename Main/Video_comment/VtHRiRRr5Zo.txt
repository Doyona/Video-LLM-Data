Heading is already banned in walking football but it's a big part of professional football so I don't think it will be banned there.
The vaseline works greatly when you have dry, clean and old gloves. Tried and tested in game.
What does contrfrsal mean
"Only real Kieran brown fans like this comment "
I love your video's
That's why Maradona hit it with the hand, to avoid brain damage. We would have been deprived of his brilliant intellect for all those years after he retired
0:30 you are wearing the wrong colour under layer
I’m only 9 so I’m not even allowed to do headers and I don’t think header would really be for me so I don’t really hate the idea of banning it but for other people that just might quit
heading is soo helpful and it sould not be banned or im quiting football
bro go to a real game porgutle
Bro became 2021 mason mount with this one 😂
5:24 the amount of mud on his leg is crazy tbh😂
Gang who saw the dog
Yeah, but his FIFA real life no, it’s not not trying to be rude just telling
Poor Connors legs 4:56
If they ban heading in football, then surely they need to ban boxing, MMA, scrums in rugby etc.
Dont put vaseline on ur gloves it rips them trust ive done it👍👍👍👍
nope
😊
W  golly
10:39  *not really*
Since I am from Scotland it is valid because a lot of the balls here are always rock solid so I understand
5:55 you need older gloves for it to work
He's wrong because FIFA made a rule that glove logos have to be smaller than 10in
i think this is true 10:16
IMO: headers can probably be protected with some sort of headband.  Maybe minor head protection for corners?
Headers are NEEDED
Do not ban heading I'm not a big fan of heading but it's extreme to ban it
So if a goalkeeper has sticky stuff on gloves and receives a yellow at the start can he still wear the gloves?
3:15 so you could technically attach your gloves to two massive brick walls on either side and just block the whole goal 😂
without headers, ronaldo would never be able to recreate some of his best goals
What about metal studs I mean if you know what I talkin' abortions like comment man like sheeshkabab
Without heading how would corners work?
4:33 Connor your poor legs there so muddy mate 😂
3:40 there was MAD pun intended 😑
There are rules with boots, but it's to do with the type of studs (cleats) they are. You can't for example, wear a rugby boot because of the sharper angle of stud. They also can't be worn down or expose metal
if headers were removed I would hate football
This comment won’t get 1 like😂😂😂😂😂😂
Naaa fam just look ————> 5:06
Heading gives the tall people an advantage and the small people a disadvantage
Cat pigeons time. of all the "Football" codes across the world, rugby football, American football, association football (soccer) Gaelic football ect, the only one that is should truly be called football is Aussie Rules. GASPS!! Yes they pass the ball by punching it or kicking it to each other. But he reason it is truly football is that it is the only game where scoring a goal must be with a players foot. You can't head it in, chest it in or bounce it off another player. Sits back to await the indignant flak from all.
So with the goalkeeper I use glove glue it makes the ball sticky
1:54 is That a basket Ball??
…
When heading just don’t stick your tonuge out you could bite your tongue while trying a header
I don’t think they should band heading
Without headers , corner kick goals will be less exciting , id say don’t do headers in practices / off pitch & only in game on corner kicks / free kicks
I’m a chicken
Bro if there is no heading I will be so mad
Am i weird or did everyone else find "let's have a little heading session" a little freaky

Alright now ima do a speed run to get a red card
As a goalkeeper, I think heading is crucial especially when sometimes you have to rush outside of your box - where you can’t use your hands - and your only option is to header the ball out.
5:00 his knee down
No definitely not
Isn’t Vaseline a lubricant? Makes no sense to me
In my opinion i think fifa should ban heading only from inside the box This means there will still be high challenges and head passes, but no goals from the head PS leave a like pls it is my birthday😜
why not just wear a helmet when heading a football?
yay I am top comment
Yo the mickey mouse gloves
they should make the ball lighter so that they don't ban heading
The Vaseline essentially hidrates the latex on the gloves keeping them sticky and also makes them hydrophobic so water or mud doesn’t stick to the gloves and ensures the glove always has the latex active
IM NOT LETTING TOP COMMENT BE "IM NOT LETTING TOP COMMENT BE" "ONLY REAL KIERAN BROWN FANS CAN LIKE THIS COMMENT."
u cant score the goal in football its a new rule

8:58 you think that's mad? I have a friend who wears 1 black boots and 1 white on the other
If they ban headers, then corners are unplayable and useless. No mention that will make game more simplistic, and that is no good.
if heading should be removed shouldnt the entire game of hockey or american football be banned too?
if they ban headers ronaldo would have like 20 less goals
if your not gay, like this comment 💀
Bro I thought it was just where we played at for no heading
I am U8s almost U9s and they banned heading and throwins
I can't imagine not having heading in soccer that would suck
I don’t line headers so please ban it
Goalkeeepers💀💀💀💀
6:28 He say boots but youtube subtitles say something else 😭💀😏
I think heading should be a use at your own risk
wow
The heading thing ain't real three of my team mates got concussion one severe but hasn't been banned get
the wierdest law in football is if its a penalty shootout after a draw and you're team has less players on the ptich because of a red card the other team has to reduce their palyer's to the numbers of player on you're team so bassicly remove one player
Imagine a corner kick or an indirect free kick without headers bro we never would have had the Flying Dutchman goal without headers
At my school  headers  are banned which is stupid
I for one want heading to get banned, because i don’t want brain damage, and i think it’s pretty likely that players will get it ever long periods of time.
It’s actually called soccer here
I have only headed the ball twice or trice while playing, I once was in a football training camp, and one time there was a heading session. I tried to hide away or skip turns because I was very afraid of the ball hitting my head. Until this point I only head the ball if there's no other option.
Real
I was heading in football matched from 9
I'm a player of U12s and we are allowed to header
11:10 Matt Clarke wouldn’t stand a chance without headers
I play u12 football and heading is not banned
BWFC
Van dijk will be useless in the box cause he is great at headers he can only shoot out of box bangers
So...... What was the first broken rule?
4:29 he looks like mac allister 😂
I don’t feel like heading should be banned. I play u12s Saturday  and Sunday and when I’m allowed to head on Saturday I always do and never have any pain
Vaseline is  a lubricant is it not??
5:40 the goalkeeper looks like Mac allister
bro then it not football any more
they can not ban ban heading it would not be as fun at all to play
HOW TO SCORE CORNERS 🤣🤣
Given you are wearing sweatpants instead of shorts and you don't have a proper jersey on which has a number, your undershirt is the least of your problems and not something anyone would pick up on here.
Keiran’s music taste 👌
If heading is banned games gone soft you are not getting cte from a header
Why Bolton stadium it’s horrid the blue with the grey corners err
For the heading rule I've gotta say something. I developed a chronich illness called post traumathic headache, not very bad, but sometimes I fell like shit. The point is my doctor specifically told me to try and not head a ball when possible, basically telling me to try and avoid football. I understand the rule, and, while being controversial, I think it will be better for the people
Bro, you know I’m gonna be a football player when I grow goalkeeper and a striker 1:08
I hate the heading ban  most of the crosses result in headers I think that players only head 1-2 times a game and the pain only lasts 2-3 minutes
im imagining 2 midfielders doing a bicycle kick after the keeper shoots the ball

it is impossible to not use your head in football
I thought there were restrictions when it comes to boots, like there can’t be a front stud or something?
What is the point of rule number 4?
VAR CHECKING POSSIBLE HEADER
go kierin
suiiii⚽
nnnbhhbjkjjnnnnnjnuh
with no heading theres more biyckl s
During rule 1, you are also violating another equipment rule. Goalkeepers are allowed tracksuit bottoms, but other players have to wear shorts. You can wear undershorts, but, like undershirts, they have to be the same colour as your short legs.  Also,  reading the rule, the only reasons why hanging off the crossbar to save a penalty is not allowed are because the keeper must keep at least one foot on the line until the ball is kicked (to avoid keepers moving forward to reduce the kicker's options) and because, as you said, you can't hit or touch the posts before the ball is kicked to distract the taker. With that said, if you manage to hang on to the crossbar after the ball is kicked and still manage to save it, it's fair game.
Love these videos
His gloves looked 10 years old, new gloves might work better with Vaseline
At 5.24 mins in his legs were pure dirty and that’s why you shouldn’t play in mud if ur training
The heading ban would make corners almost entirely useless
I personally think that the last rule is good because if you head the ball and get a concussion, you cant really play on, but thats just my take, keep up the good work!
in my opinion the undershirt should be either white or black
The only heading problem is heading other heads, not the ball... 😅

John cena
What was the issue with the legel scecher boots?
aw princess to soft to head the ball go play bowels girl
I cant see heading being taken out the game at all. A ball is played long, instinctively you go for a header, same for a corner, you head the ball, although if they want to kill the game of football, it will come into force.
That’s  rules from baseball because can’t sickly times on the  🧤
yes, it realy dose hurt your head
The long-term effects of too mmany headers is not something you can actually feel in form of pain or any kind of discomfort. The symptoms are likely to surface much later.
That showboating rule is fucking ridiculous.   "You're too good. Have a yellow card!"  U wot m8?
As a defender I’d think it’s absolutely stupid if heading gets banned
The rules on kits in the Premier league is different to many. You can't have anything on the kit that looks like something. You can have multiple things that just look like a pattern, but you can't blatantly have something e.g a lion, city skyline, a tree, ect.
1:07 bruv I support wba and that is furlong and 1:11 is Conor townsend
How does lubricant make more grip?

Theyll just handball grip now.
never expected to see the reebok in the thumbnail of this video
Heres the thing, You put way too much vaseline on there You had to put only a small amount
It’s so funny because no one sits you down and explains the rules of the game when you’re a kid. You just play. I had no idea about foul throws until I did one
Bro waffles on a bit. "This next thing i'm gonna show you broke several rules".
What was the issue with the Sketchers boot then? Is it just cause they signed Harry Kane straight away? Why are they illegal
*law
Onana needs bigger gloves than ones you had on but he still let goals in
It would ruin corners if u couldn’t head it
Two rules in, only tells half the story, making the rule sound entirely nonsensical because it leaves out the part that's actually unfair. Good job on the vid, m8
aren't you also breaking the rule of outfield players wearing tracksuit bottoms?
You look like Cody Bellinger
The final rule is mad, this rule is so stupid
They’re Never gonna take heading out of the game just putting restrictions on the amount of training headers
Banning heading would be a huge issue. And banning heading only at youth level is also extremely strange. The youth doesn't get to practice the game as it should be played then.  It's also a lot about how the assist is given, something that in pro play might be difficult to change because you have to give the ball a lot of speed. At youth levels this isn't nearly as crucial.   A much bigger health issue than heading is all the other substances they use as well. But having said that all it was a long time coming already. Sometimes heading the ball just once feels really bad.
The subsitutes can refuse to be subbed reminds me of the league cup final when arizbalaga refused to come off. Sarri was absolutely furious and almost walked off the stadium. That was rather amusing episode.
Imagine signing a player to a lifetime contract and he can't say the brand name
I can kind of understand about heading, it might explain Sergio Ramos...... On the other hand the likes of Wayne Rooney is just too thick headed to ever have side effects from it
They should have a dedicated header player in the team, and if current players aren't willing to do that for £100k+ a week I'd quite happily fill that role for them.
Vaseline is a lube... not a tacky substance... so I've heard.
Was that Will Norris testing out the vaseline gloves?
Its always been insane that football (soccer) players well go down like they have been shot at the slightest bit of contact, but willing to take bullet shots to the head and move on like nothings happened
I thought keepers weren’t allowed to touch the posts at all prior to a penalty, let alone hang of em.
hand of god
sick video. seemed really well researched and edited. think you could have ended it a bit smoother though as it cut quite abruptly. also, i think the music transitions were a bit hard as well but overall really enjoyed the video!
then a penalty should be taken with a straight run up with no stuttering allowed at all once the taker has started his run up then he cant stutter or a free kick be given and a booking to the penalty taker
Interesting but football doesn't have rules, they are laws of the game.
How will League One look without heading?
One of my teachers had a lot of scars on his forehead from heading the old balls which had valves that stuck out from the ball slightly. Ouch.
if you hedar the ball that is your disioun so if you hedar  your asking for it
Heading will never be banned.  Nobody says Boxers should stop hitting each other in the face, as sportspeople we have to accept some risks when we play the sports we love.
I said it 35 years ago that heading a ball is dangerous and should not be allowed,nobody listened at all.i was in my teens but boy that ball hurts. I can only imagine the force a player meets the ball direct from e.g a goal kick,meeting it head on and heading it back the way it came,can you imagine the impact.ok it's part of the game and players get on with it but it's not natural.there has to be consequences in later years
Is incredible the effort that football asociations are making to make football incredibly boring
Ok but why are you at Bolton in the thumbnail?
The Argentinian cheat was actually 40 years ahead of his time.  He just stopped heading the ball and used his hand instead.
If heading is illegal then my little brother (who is U12) and his team are in deep trouble. They practise heading every session and are told to head the ball and dont be scared
I always had a little chuckle when people thought Puma were crazy. I can’t remember the name of the player but when Luton were in League 2 we had a player that would wear two different boots. Same brand but different
You made a nice video.  I enjoyed it.  But the way you head the ball you get a headache.  You never EVER head with her between your head and the ball.  With the plate between hair and eyebrows of your head you hit the ball.😉
Nah, possession ticky taka means heading high and long balls isn't such a feature in modern pro football. Just minimise practice with heading drills, and monitor, monitor, monitor...
To this day Jordan Pickford is still tapping the bar before a penalty
Headers is true tho, few headers gave me a couple light concussions, nothing too bad but could’ve been worse tbh 😂
Football doesn't have rules
Ban heading FIFA
Ban heading and allow all players in the penalty area to punch / slap the ball (but only goalies can catch).... just a thought
Use handball glue on gloves...
Very difficult to hear you due to the overloud back ground music 😞
I am defender and I took 18 shoots to the head I suffered concusion after the game
With heading, it's not just the ball to head contact that is concerning, at least not for younger kids. The other concern is when the player comes down, doesn't land on their feet, and their head goes down. The ground and other players' feet can contact the player's head causing damage.

If you ban heading, you'll have to ban boxing, UFC and MMA. 👀
I honestly thought that adding Vaseline to your gloves would have the complete opposite effect of making them grippy. Don't people use Vaseline as, um......you know......a lubricant? Wouldn't it make your gloves more slippery? Seemed to suggest that was the case in this test, with the ball wanting to jump out of his hands.  I mean come on, Ice Cube even brought out a song called 'No Vaseline' that was all about "gettin' f*cked with no Vaseline" lol  Now if you tried adding Swarfega heavy duty hand cleaner? Maybe. That stuff has got like, full on grit in it!
No
Those old footballs were like heading soggy cannonballs so you can see why past days footballers could get head traumas. But modern footballs are coated so don't get waterlogged and too heavy. I think head traumas will gradually disappear.
Many Goalkeepers have an extra rubber fingertip pad in their gloves giving them an added inch or so of reach. Pro gloves will also have a rib system behind the fingers to strengthen those tips. So maybe its time for Rule against that.
The header rule is ridiculous. Improve the ball (new matrials, less air pressure etc), limit practice sessions, improve head techniques etc. It seems something that can be solved without removing such a vital part of the game.

Removing headers would be pathetic. It’s the risk players accept same as boxers, there’s risk in all sports
I’m not a big fan of headers to be honest (because I’m not used to it) but it could make it that there might be more volleys

Bolton ground in thumbnail bro😂😂
Kevin Doyle retired because he has headed the ball too much throughout his career.
3:23 bro got the mickey mouse pro supreme gloves
I think banning heading would have it's pros and cons personally I don't think it would do much with health bc for me I never intentionally do headers but that won't stop ppl from getting hit in the head with the ball but it would be almost impossible to defend free kicks And corners without being allowed to head
If you play football you know most of these
I am U11 and I head the ball all the time and never get told off by the ref
Unique idea, implemented well too. Game would be so weird without heading.
They banding heading cuz Ronaldo was too good at it 🗿
Greatest stadium ever Bolton Wamderers 😍
5:48 kepa did it
Great video
Bolton stadium in the thumbnail the macron on the seats is gone im pretty sure.
The game is so soft already. Why ban headers
I've got an interesting rule. If a player is not on the field of play, the player is considered to be at the point on the pitch closest to them. That means that if, for whatever reason, a player is behind the goal line, they are considered to be on the line for the purposes of offsides. Obviously, in most scenarios, this would not be a useful rule to exploit, however, if your opponents also had 2 players behind the line, it wouldn't matter if you were in the next city over, you would still be onside as you would be considered level with the 2 other players who are also off the pitch.  This rule is most commonly interpreted to be used as the place a free kick (or penalty) is taken from if a foul occurs off the pitch, but I think this is an interesting interpretation of the rule that could be exploited in a goalline scramble that ends up with multiple players in the goal mouth/net and/or over the touchline near the advertising boards.   I think it also means that if a pass is played from on the touchline, as long as a fraction of a millimetre of the ball is off the pitch, no one can be offside as the pass would always be considered at least level with play, if not backwards. This is more easily exploitable as you could intend to pass to a teammate who was just coming back from the end of the pitch, but you could wait for the ball to be on the line before kicking it to ensure your teammate is back onside.
The goalkeeper was NEVER at any point allowed to shake the crossbar during a penalty kick. They COULD shake the woodwork BEFORE the penalty kick, but the goalposts and crossbar must be still at the point the penalty is taken. This is not a new rule.
One of the old headlines for preds was “100% legal, 0% fair”
If there is no glove size regulation, is there a glove material regulation? If not, couldn’t you just just put a huge block of whatever on the goal line that covers the whole goal and attach it to the gloves?
nice
9:54 heading banned in u12? Im learning headers in u11 bro
Please try the new euros ball fussballliebe!
2:40 neither can outfield players. Here in Argentina people became aware of that rule when Martin Palermo, a brilliant striker who only played a few years in Europe, scored in the national derby hanging on the crossbar. The goal did stand, but the rule was talked about in every newspaper. It was a summer friendly, though.
Dear Kieran,  I am coen jacobs and I’m 15 years old. I am a goalkeeper for Dutch side beek vooruit in Prinsenbeek (left of Breda) Would you like to do a video with me on your channel?

Yours sincerely, Coen Jacobs
On the Ball drying just use your shirt
I saw a newspaper article that said that every time your head gets hit some of your brain cells completely die off
5:48 everyone know this because of kepa
I put vaseline on my d-
Does anybody know how effective glove glue is and if it ruins gloves in the long term?
Formers footballers with brain injuries.... nothing to do with the 10 pints a night theyd drink?  I understand banning it for juniors as they're not developed enough but imagine being a cb without heading the ball.  And then the occupational risk of retiring at 35 and living another 35 years plus with great money... sign me up
I think football would be better and safer without heading.  Or they could look at addressing the weight and impact of a standard football so it's doesn't effect people as much.  Showboating should be allowed, makes no sense to not allow it as any dribble past a player is technically showboating.
just dry ball with shirt?
Limit it in training but do not remove it from games Do 1 heading session A week or every other week with 5-7 headers in a session
If heading was banned I wouldn’t be able to defend 😂😂😂
The glove one only works if you apply it before the gloves have been used I think?
Next, they'll want to get rid of keeper in general since it's the most dangerous position
I think fifa will make it compulsory to wear those black helmets that are made for football so that heading will not cause to much damage
For a centre back i couldn't imagine a game without heading, also all the attacking players have to do a bicycle kick, a scorpion kick or just nothing when a ball comes pretty high so i really hope heading isn't getting banned
TEH Vaseline goalie beimg muddie gives me ocd

Vaseline trick works you just put a comically large amount on
I dont think theyll ban heading, it doesnt happen enough in a game to the same player to be much of a worry. No player is doing 10 or 20 headers a game. Not that ive seen anyway
If they would proceed to remove headers, Oliver Giroud would just be nerfed.    Don't take it seriously i love Oliver.
If headers aren't allowed how do you give it to your goalkeeper do they just scrap backpasses
Ι want the puma difrerent colour ones
With the goalkeepers not being able to destract the taker, they're allowed to dance aslong as they're behind the line as they're not actually on the pitch. Hope this helps
The big problem is CTE.
I have to play in the heading rule because I’m 9 yet I play for under 11s Etwall fc you can join if you want need players and it’s so annoying that you can’t header
WE NEED HEADERS
In America, refs sometimes check the bottom of our cleats to make sure they’re soccer cleats and don’t have weird studs.
How did the golakeeper get dirty?
Footballers gonna be playing with helmets soon...
0:32 how does the ball go from one to the other and then again later on
For the vaseline on the gloves you need to use less vaseline and spray water on it!!!
I don’t think you can ever ban heading in football as it’s such a big and important part of the game.    I completely understand banning it for children though.  Also, I play CM and I’m quite tall and win a lot of headers from goal kicks and do have headaches now and then later in the day so I do think something will be done about it.  Maybe more padding on the balls, lighter balls or absorbable headbands for players, I don’t know.
Blud is in my book 💀😭
they should change the first rule and have the sleeve line be where handling offences start.
The league caught wind of Ben Tozer’s throw ins and decided to nerf him lol
You should put less Vaseline
GOD LOVES US ALL REPENT OF YOUR SINS JESUS IS LORD:D🙏

Caution only means maybe.
Can you try American football gloves as goalie gloves? Keepers for my teams say they're way stickier than normal gloves
On my high school team last season, we had 3 concussions from heading the ball. It’s just a precautionary rule.
Great to see Luke in the video
5:11, No I actually did that💀💀💀 ended up scoring a tap in, in the 76th
Gyat 😮
It is called Repetitive Head Impacts (RHI) - lots of research on it potentially leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE. Basically, repeated low magnitude head impacts can be just as bad as high magnitude events that cause immediate concussion symptoms. Very much linked with collision/contact sports (Hockey, American Football, Rugby) and more focus now on Football in light of recent evidence/research coming out and our knowledge of how often players head the ball
bro your not heading correctly, you dont close your eyes
For heading, I feel it depends on the ball.  Some outer materials feel harder than others and when properly inflated can feel great for kicking but terrible for heading.
You're not breaking any in-game rules in the last set of videos.

Problem with banning heading is that it will make corners less significant because the goalkeeper will be able to dominate the area close to him
if they remove headders there will just be more high boots
Hi

Glove glue not allowed
females are like 3x more susceptible to concussions (not exactly sure on the number but they are more likely to be concussed than guys) and I know lots of girls that have had repeat head injuries from football to the point of having to stop playing. so I can see why they are looking into reducing headers, especially in youth.
The heading ban is fair enough, yes it takes away from the sport but the damage it does in the long run is concerning, health comes first.
CTE is a real issue - heading will have to go.

Great video.  As someone whose knees ballooned at 30 but now I’ve retrained at 50 and playing again proper running and avoiding heading is key.  I love football and while no heading seems weird I agree it should be removed.  In a way it actually increases the skill level of the game.  Maybe we’ll see more bicycle kicks;

Small impacts repeatedly experienced add up to brain damage. Lots of proper science and clinical work has been done on this. Not really in doubt anymore. Every sport with head contact has a history of long term issues for players that has had a blind eye turned to it. Time to be honest with our players and ourselves and make the game safer in an important way.
with the Vaseline, the reason it wasn't working well is because the gloves has to be wet. that will make it grippier
I’ve never been this early to a Kieran brown vid, but I love it…
Hey kieran
Hi
8:04 I’ve always wondered what boot Harry Kane wore, now I know! 8:54 I remember sock boots, when they first came out everyone only wanted to wear sock boots 😂
Man never give up ur amazing bruv
Ok
8:24 I don't like these at all **scores a sceamer**
Just some more rules for VAR to rule out a goal 😐 (Great vid as always though)
Hi
That clip with Turkish player Salih Dursun showing a red card to the referee is truly iconic, now he has a statue in Trabzon, Turkey. 😂😂
Yo sketchers actually makes football boots because Tom Lockyer who plays for Luton he wears them

Without heading,it would be difficult for defenders to clear the ball and will help attackers with more tactical plays
