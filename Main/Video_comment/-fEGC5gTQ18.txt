I can't decide if Tavarish is a genius or a madman, but either way this is going to be the biggest project ever! Sadly though, after our run out in his 675LT Spider, you might also be aware that engine has gone bang too... not ideal. Check out the P1 and more on ECR: https://exclusivecarregistry.com/details/mclaren/p1/1397
We all know how this will end. 😅
The positive energy from all this speaks for itself... <3
Damn... that yellow McLaren.... they should have given it to you for free with the guarantee when you build it back to a working car and you would sell it, then they get some money...  Only Wizards can bring these kind of cars back on the road... R e s p e c t...
If I was in trouble I’d want this guy on my side .
Now it cost 2M to build 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My buddy would pick cars up to rebuild that looked like junk to me and he would tell me..."it's got good bones" I think Freddy's P1 has good bones....
is there a car that Freddy wont buy?
How could a battery cost 170k$?
We all live in a yellow submarine.   Yellow submarine.   Yellow submarine.  🎶🎵🎤🎸🥁
I'm still looking to watch part 3 ?
That cbr clean af!
Definitely a step up from a neon pink mini-van!
I'm selling hurricane proof tupper ware containers to keep your cars in .
I love this guy , his smart and he will repair the P1
"Service Exceeded By 1500 Days"
Car madness has hit shmee very well
He should put the sand in resin and make some parts out of it.
*Freddy/Tavarish is a legend*
Why not drain the water out of the headlights? You keep pointing it out?
My hero ,I'm an instructor for Rolls-Royce Gas turbine and would love to have had this challenge.I would have never had the money 💰 This is a challenge on many levels..My hero...God bless
Best no-pressure signiture ever!!!! Well done Shmee.
YouTubers rehashing other YouTuber's content.
I'm a casual Freddy/Vinwiki/Hobbie viewer. Seen plenty of others just by YouTube recommendations.    Why are people putting so much stock on "biggest rebuild"? Is there a YouTube car community thing...bragging rights maybe?   For me, it's a cool, challenging build. Never crossed my mind if it's the biggest one ever or whatever.
I love what he said at 2:31min  That's the mind of a man with ambition...  Not playing games.
was this before or after he blew it up lol the time line xD and ok! i knew id find ut if i kept watching random videos sooo they did reach out to him? xD
After Freddy's engine exploded I now realise why McLaren keep that engine locked away and void your warranty if you open and tune as the engines are designed to handle the horsepower it was given and no more.tune these engines beyond the threshold and they explode !!! A flaw McLaren don't want exposed !
I say he'll eventually give up on this project. I don't think he'll get the parts to get this car running again
Saw that Video of the tow and that was making me feel Sick.  I was a Driver and had to learn how to tow Corvettes.  That diver was crazy bad
Question! Does Changing a HIper car ruin the value
Can't wait to see the P1 fixed.  Yellow &Black is my favorite but the Blue is Beautiful
What happened to the Rolls Royce that was sat next to The P1 in the flood ? What state is that in ?
Have i missed something, or did shmee take a ride in the 675 before it...... You know, has gone BOOM?
Freddy is such a nice fella!
Freddy sounded so irritated anytime he had to "mhm" or "yeah" in response.
Should have included an affiliate link for 'keeps'. Obviously it doesn't work ..
iv revived pc by submerging it into 90% rubbing alcohol so maybe try that
This guy schmeeee comes off as the BIGGEST snob
You repaired the busted engine on MCLaren?
God bless YouTube for allowing crazy folks to do crazy things for our entertainment, for free.
God I hope Freddy changed the color when he finally gets it painted. Yellow is such a garish, cheap looking color.
$557 k  in that condition? that is a parts only car 85% of parts list is damage!
Just by him doing it and being on YouTube and signed by prominent stars of YouTube it’s only going to appreciate the final product even more.  Even though it’s water damage it’s value will far exceed value even if it were restored by McLaren themselves.
So the 675 broke after he got the P1
i wish him the best of luck with this. This will turn out awesome once finished, whenever it gets finished
I though the blue McLaren blew up!
I just wanna say forget it
I genuinely hope that McLaren help him out with at least some heavily discounted prices on parts he will need. They could use some good publicity.
That’s what I love about McLaren. They’re willing to help you out and are excited to see the car back to life. Mercedes does that same thing. Ferrari in the other hand is like good luck or we don’t know what piece you need.
His interior is beautiful I think.
I'm thinking this P1 won't be as bad as first viewing. When all things considered it won't be the money pit we all first thought.
Lmao the hole YouTube car community trying to hype up the algorithm to save him from this terrible financial decision 😅
Tavarish has purchased the car with a bank loan and to the casual viewer the presumption is that the only thing of value is the car however in reality he is going to generate a huge amount of income from the ad revenue and ad shares from other youtubers that is likely going to entirely cover the finance and make him a tidy profit too.
Take the battery to @richrebuilds
Is that a boat hanging on the wall behind Freddie?  🤣
Good luck to him trying to register that car for the road, that'ss a $600.000 trailer queen with a junk title!
Shmee! Dude! What is the watch you're wearing!? You used to wear a Rolex Daytona (correct me if I'm wrong) I think? What went wrong?😉
Tavarish is a very positive person ❤that’s the best thing about him
Damn I can't even afford the dollies the car is rolling around on.
Contact V engineering in UK. They are developing an aftermarket battery for the P1 👍🏻
This is the same guy that didn't restore an mr2 because he said it needed too much work back in the day 🤣
Ya . That was awesome when he picked it up to . Amazing car . And store.  And buy . And project.
This could be really great PR for Maclaren if they got involved with Freddie to help him with this. But it has to be restored in his shop, taking it to a dealership would just kill the garage resto vibe.
If every subscriber donated 5$$ all problems should be fixed.... so ask us. We all want that car restored to full glory.
At least they aren’t like Ferrari. Good job Freddy! For those who don’t work on em. They are just nuts and bolts and some carbon fibre. 😊
This is Freddie's abandon mansion project... Lol
WOnderful, watching all of this
Larry at Ammo NYC may need to do a collab with Freddy to get this beast clean and sanitized!!!
Nice aventi watch @shmee
Just amazing
Wow That Blue McLaren Looks Beautiful 💙
Tavarish is a mad man. I’m so so excited to see this build.
I thought he blow the engine on that blue McClaren🤔? Guess he got it fixed🤷🏽
If he brings it to Europe.  He needs to drive it at the Brooklands Festival of Speed. Oh yes, and maybe a wherehouse in Ponte Carlo (Pontefract, WestYorkshire), a certain F1 boss may like to see it.
You've got to take risks sometimes.
Wait, did Freddy already have his old McLaren engine rebuilt or was this filmed before that?   Also, that's a damn insane project build.
How much to rebuild the P1 ,        And then what would it sell for with a savage title .
Anyone else confused on the timeline? Did the LT already get fixed?
Houston lost out on this one.  Good for you🎉
How are you going to be able to insure this?
When he is done with this project he needs to take it to McLaren just to show them what can be done.
How much did he pay for it? That's the most important interest to me
So he brought the P1 before the engine on Long tail blown. Ok
He might be crazy, but it’s a kind of crazy I love and respect. I hope he turns this into at least 150 videos because I want to see everything on this rebuild.
Is it sad that I've seen more about this car from OTHER channels than I have from Tavarish's channel?
This car went bang ! ; bang ! ; bang ; bang   McLaren P1nball 😂
the only mclaren concern will probably be the chassis integrity (btw it looks in perfect shape-no high speed accident) if it can’t be restored properly they might be less interested in the project, it doesn’t mean they will not support, otherwise they should be happy someone is saving their hard work that could’ve been lost forever
it sounds like a terrible idea, it would take a lot of money to sort it out and it will probably sell for not that much but… the yt views …😂 plus the car will have a story to tell
I wish Tavarish would Coach Build the P1 instead of restore it. Imagine this is the perfect platform to have a completely new one off hypercar.
Something tells me Freddie is wayyyy behind in his uploads
The whole story is still fishy. Buys an extremely low mileage p1 for almost $2m. When a hurricane is forecast seemingly no effort is made to get this thing to safety. Really? If you'd just dropped that much into something you'd at least try and get it out of there surely.
Its just an over engineered prius.  😂
I want to see ammo nyc clean this
idea here: to continue and preserve the cars story, Tavarish could take some of the sand that infested the car, and turn it into glass. I dont know what piece he can make out of glass, but, that would be so cool.
"We Had Engine Damage" - yeah, the rod going through the block zipping down the street and essentially making the engine scrap. lol
Trvarish has to meet the old owner once it's rebuilt!
I have a 10000% confidence this dude will finish and complete this job
I love it but the steering wheel looks thin
That bucket of sand and broken wheel would fit well on the VinWikki set!
That is better than any McLaren from delivery
just a beautiful car, and love your Avanti watch, just shocked that Mclaren did not buy this cat back and fix it themselves after all the work they put into it
It was rebuilt now???????, from what I remember it was bleeding on the side of the road...
Anader 500000$ my com beck to his original glory
Did you call Sandy Munro?
Every car youtuber is stopping by for this one :) It's gonna be the biggest rebuild in youtube history.
I don't understand why Freddie hit "buy now" instead of letting it go to bidding.  Have to give him credit for knowing what he's doing though.
LMAO this guy BORROWED 500,000 for this ruined car. He'll never repair it in full. He'll try his usual sam crack hacks for jamming parts of other cars onto his, like his twin turbo lambo. He won't make 500,000 from views, he said so himself. Everyone is laughing their asses off at him. McClaren would probably rather the car went to a dignified end, not be hack slashed on youtube by a untrained, uncertified McClaren mechanic. You need one just to do an oil change. Anyone who buys any of these youtuber rebuilds is a total doofus. Value is in the records. Not GOONBOIZ and Trashvarish built trash cars that break when "completed" They're probably insulted.  McClaren takes their pedigree really seriously. This is sad for a car like this. McClaren should've bought it back and put it in glass case or something. I'm not a fan of these channels. It's insulting to the cars. It's like buying a race horse, then feeding it trash and mistreating it.  Just my opinion. I don't internet fight. If Trashvarish is your hero, LOL at you,. I don't care.
Ls1 swapped p1?? Lol
Crazy that the original owner didn't have lifts in his garage.  He would still have a sweet P1 and the Bentley(?) for what amounts to maybe $15k at the most.  I would have certainly have lifts in my garage if I live in Flordia or any hurrican flood zone if I had that set of rides.
Probably could've got it for 300k
If that battery is sealed surely it should be ok.
When every single part is damaged, what is left to salvage? This looks like an immense waste of money.
Maybe you can talk to McLaren and try to figure out, if they can support him...
$10 says that battery is still functional.
$10 says that battery is still functional.
"I can lean on this car...." Dramatic foreshadowing intensifies.
I love Tavarish, i've been following him for awhile now and I think the thing we all love most about him is his genuine love for cars, fixing them and how thankful he is for his followers. Great dude!
i do believe that he would actually benift from a good gesture from his fellow youtubers who are looking for view on their channel over his shoulders with his huge burden now, wouldn't it be awesome if you for example would buy him the missing mirror or a dash or anything you can think of and send it to him as a surprise ? thinking out load !
Shmee you have to get Tavares to give Rich rebuilds a call I understand it’s his show but he’s great with electrical powertrain vehicles.
Oh my anyone knows what brand is Schmee's watch?
I'm watching the video and thinking it will be very cool if you can use the sand and put it in some way in the car, to be seen , when is ready , and Shmee is saying to Tavarish "why don't you use the sand to display it in the car when is done"! Nice video this dude Tavarish is very brave BRAVO!
In the end he’ll be lucky to break even if he is able to sell it down the line
I think millage is not necessary on a flooded car 😂
Hopefully McLaren sees this and can offer assistance of some sort.  If they're smart, they'd realize that could go a long way to help re-brand their company.
damn Hurricane P1 sounds great
was this pre or post the 675 engine yeeting a rod through the bottom of the block.
The fact that he killed the 675 a few weeks ago makes this video sad. That car was so nice, now that engine is an expensive coffee table.
This is a head scratcher.  You may have big the big one on this one.
Hell yeah
I would get it running mechanically and obviously replace the screen and replace/restore the interior etc, however I would leave the body work as is scars and all......
it was reborn iun the hurican. why not call it the p1 hurican.
Had no idea of this Shmee lad Tavarish's mad purchase has definitely brought together some cool cool car people and YouTubers! Loving it!!!  I was a Tavarish and Sam Crac follower 😅
Oh my... he REALLY should get rid of the battery ASAP!!! It's not about sparks! It's a f-ing lithium battery! This thing could combust in flames any seconds and take the whole car with it. This would be a huge bummer.
Hasbulla father
Years passed but the Shmee 150 intro still fire! 🔥🔥
I'm in some type of Tavarish time warp.
what i dont get, if you buy it for 2 Million and you get the news that there is going to be a hurricane why dont you either get it picked up, or pay someone to drive it into safety
This car is why we have write off laws here in Australia that means the car has to go through the crusher.
Maybe someone may have mentioned this, but..........would it not be so cool, if McLaren would step up to the plate and help Freddy with parts and expertise to help get his vehicle back on the road.  Most likely that would not happen, but it should would put a white hat on the company... a Company with a Heart !
this thing is gonna be absolutely insane when he’s done with it. can’t wait to see how he makes it HIS car like he did with the 675
Lol goonzquad bros would sell that sand in bottles to subscribers for $100 a pop
Gold digging
It is a ten year old McLaren   drop
Freddy is wholesome! Big time respect!!
Freddie is such a real one like everyone is getting a piece on this💯
Had to giggle when he said I’ve already spent 300k a roof scoop didn’t seem like a good choice, I’m like pop the hood on my astra and rebuild my motor.
I live near to where that P1 was destroyed. My house was hit pretty hard by the hurricane but it could’ve of been worse. I was so bummed out when I saw a local Mclaren, none the less a P1 was destroyed by the storm.
Tavarish needs a bra
This is amazing. The set of nuts on Tavarish to take it on 😂
I'm confused this is before he blew the blue one up right or has this been fixed now? I feel like everything we watch was recorded like 6 months ago instead of yesterday or 3 days ago 😅
Love when shmee does a us tour alot great collab videos
You only need three things to achieve anything: time, money and motivation
Ok, do I have the best widhes possibke for Freddy, but if it all goes wrong and he starts sinking with that car let's make a go fund me for him. Honestly, I'd put some chips down if it means helping the guy achieve the dream we all wish we could achieve.
This guy and this P1 are everywhere on every channel right now. It's good to see the community stepping up to save this car and T is the best guy to do it. The more exposure he gets the more Mc will step up and absorb some cost so the project can break even or come out ahead. I wish everyone the best in this endeavor and I'm looking forward to watching the process unfold.
freddy is a true genius madman!! wish him luck on his project
That "CHEEEEERERERERERERERES" always makes me cringe. I thought you'd grow out of this nonsense someday. Maybe in the next decade or so?
I got an idea put a   Boat anchor in this Time it want float away
I remember this car, and it was located about 20 min from me. Very sad to everyone who lost their lives in this storm. Some pretty amazing cars were lost as well. 2 prestine dodge daytonas were  Among the high dollar cars lost
I can't believe all the foreshadowing conversation... 14:49 😳
You should put a 12v Cummins in it.
"I don't do anything stupid with it.." 'cut to him flying through the air in it'
"never seen a P1 that brought the beach with it" made me chuckle
Is legend a synonym for stupid?   I want Freddie to pull this off, but I think this is more work than he thinks it will be.  This has to be a nut and bolt restoration.
Go Freddy Go!!!
Sad to see the engine completely fucked.  Good "content" I suppose.
Oh back when the LT wasn't toast
I hope McLaren do help him through this! He deserves it!
how much did he pay? (missed it if he said it)
So....this was filmed BEFORE the Maccas engine got lunched then!
The whole community is behind Freddie on this one
Has he already fixed the blown out engine of the old McLaren?
I was wondering what was going on then because he blew the engine but this must have been a month or two before, also he only just posted his video on the p1, timelines.
I dont understand the timeline of your uploads and fellow YouTubers recording with you?? I thought your McLaren 675 had engine damage and after that you bought the P1? You made a own video tavaris about the how excited you are to collect the P1 but you already saw it! What real and whats fake?
Rip LT
Now I hear your idea to sell the sand
Sell the settlement it’s famous
Me of little faith... the hybrid system will not work unless he spends the purchase price again on it. There is literally zero chance of the electronics ever working again that were submerged. Prove me wrong Freddy tho. I am somebody who is hard to impress but if this rolls again with all the hybrid ponies working...
If that's my car project, I would rid the hybrid system in this car.
Just watching this with a sinking feeling, knowing what is going to happen to the 675LT. I am even thinking don't rev it cold.. too late :(
Great video Tim.  I love seeing the collab between you two.  Obviously this was filmed quite a while ago.  What an epic build and so few people in the car community would have the courage to take on a project this epic.   If anyone could do it, Freddie can.   I can't wait for the next video that you check on the progress of the build.  It's good to see you both.  Cheers mate
I think a good wash and new PPF it should be close to new.
Brother some Honda dealers want to charge almost 1k for per wheel for premium wheels
I’m here for the Tavarish party…
This is so cool that you are giving exposure to Tavarish he is going to need all the help. Also this is Florida Tim laws like speed limit are suggesting 😉
Shmee, $575,000?? 😳Is Freddy on Fungicide/Herbicide WATCH?? 😳😂
Very brave since you never got the Lamborghini convertible top to work due to electrical problems
$1mil-$1.2, to do it by the book. Other than that, Freddy will look ten years older in 8 months. But, his head will be ten times larger, after learning how to fix this thing himself. If he dumps about $500-$600k in tools.. Worst case, he ends up a pauper, but he will be able to fix anything. Best case, he ends up a pauper,  who can fix anything, who also owns a really cool car.  Jesus. I wish him the best of luck.
Since the P1 uses the same block as the 675LT. I was hoping Freddie would go the extra mile and rebuild the motor and put in forged internals, sleeves, turn it into a 4.0 and turn the boost to 11 and basically build the most powerful P1 out there.
Congrats on your short block for the 675 . Personally I still think you should have sold i  'As Is' but you have decided to replace/rebuild the engine with a new short block and all necessaty components. Have fun . Goodluck on the maintenance .
Your blinking fluid is getting low
fake or too may people claiming this one
Does anyone knows what watch is Shmee wearing?
Awesome as always
Freddy is a legend
sharing this with Schmee, Priceless. Once it's on the road you have to have him back Please!
Aaron Kaufman says, if a Man maid it a man can repair it.
didnt he blow the motor on that car?
Please help me with my car
Let the tow truck driver pay for the rim and tire he dammaged. 👌
I thought freddy blue a hole through an engine block
Tavarish has epic builds glad he brought the P1, to rebuild!!😊
The biggest repair operation on Youtube is currently there and I am eager to watch the operation
So the blue McLaren is fixed.
Cool for shmee to hold out the video until Tavarish released his.  Proper mate
So exciting… I love how fast this is coming along…🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crazy price on battery but even battery trickle charger costs 30000$ 🫣
A real bright move by the tow truck driver $1400 worth of damage just flat bedding your car.
'Service exceeded by 1000 days'
Apart from paying $ 200 000 too much I see no issues 🙂
This didn’t age well
Get uncle rich to rehab those batteries
Amazing 🎉 The Drive 🔥 The P1 🤯 And Shmee Signing the engine cover was so awesome to watch, has me very passionate for loving cars my whole life ❤
You could have a battery MADE for 1/3 of that!
I’m really glad to see that car is going to be looked after. I hope McClaren will help with the replacement of certain parts. It would be a shame to see it go down the drain.
@richrebuilds goto Florida and do some electrical cleaning with @therealtavarish
Everyone is making it sound way worse than it actually is...
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!!!!!❤❤❤
Tow truck drivers, can't live with em, can't live without em am I right
Another YouTuber cashing in on tavarish’s work.
MCLAREN PATI-ONE !!!
Now we can watch Freddy fix 2 McLarens at once
I hope you giving tavarish half of your video revenue i even liked
Freddy said kilos , thanks mate
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 as a ex rally driver and owner of car MK2 escort 2.1 cc on 5 speed SC box 5 link back end I no things are easy to do. wish you well Tavarish
So tavarish fixed the 570
Wait so freddy bought the P1 BEFORE he nuked his 675?!
That’s no sea water boys and girls…it’s “Blinker fluid”!!! 😂
After the P1 probably he will luckily make the most expensive project a damn mclaren F1  Wonderful tavarish
I guess that Frank Costanza and Kramer could sell a couple of Bro's here.
What is the chassis no? What a project, wow.
He'll for sure make about half of it back in ad revenue/views, which reduces his "price" to what a rebuilder would want to buy it for (closer to 250K), but that's still a huge deal as he's looking at half a million, easy, to fix it.  My guess is he ends up slightly underwater in the end (maybe loses only 100K). And this is Tararish, not us mortals who would be easily 300-500K under water in the end.  My gut says to sell the 675LT and put it toward this as he's in for a wild ride.
Cool video 🔥
make your own battery, it will be much cheaper
You really do be all over the place i just seen you in streetspeed717 video lol. You just got a sub for all your hard work and gonna be checking your channel out more! Cheers!
Even if he spend a million dollars on the rebuild, that thing would bring in profits.
@Tavarish: Take the battery out please. The relais does not help. Batteries self-ignite.
Tavarish is genius . Buying a damaged car gone viral , will generate him millions of views for many videos to come. Money in the bank
manny khoshbin is selling his p1 and has three clam shells for it maybe h'e'll sell a clam shell
I love the level of respect between these two #legends and cannot wait to watch Freddy rebuild/Personalize the P1
Can Shmee even work on cars?  Doesn't seem like he could even change a belt on a civic.  That's why I don't watch him.
Call that shit the P1 Tsunami
I'm glad to hear that McLaren is willing to work with Freddy to make the car as close to 100% as he can get it.  It only makes sense for McLaren to want to see it be worthy of the pinnacle car it is.
Shmee's idea is amazing. Take some of of sand and put it in an hourglass and incorporate it subtly into the interior somewhere
Safelite can repair that windshield in about an hour
Did the LT blew up after this?
Schmee + Tavarish = The YouTube's niceste people - So easy to like, so attractive to watch their videos!
it has been tuned and runs nice.... well 😂🤣
Make an hourglass out of the sand in the car.
575K for the honor of paying another 500K to get it to drive (possibly)… then its maybe worth the 575K again. I hope he gets a lot of views to pay for it all. I am pulling for you. Also, Schmee needs a new wardrobe of bigger shirts… those buttons could take out the windshield.. lol. I should know, Covid shrank ALL of my clothes!!!
I'm thinking that submerging / dipping this in fresh water a couple of times would help immensely. Several mechanics got sick and one actually died from working on cars submerged in salt water when New Orleans had their big flood (Katrina?) due to all the mold that developed in the cars. Otherwise, this should be **completely** disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled.
I think I’ll put some cash in to this build…..for the hours of entertainment it’s going to give me in the future! Looking forward to it!
Did you film this before Tavarish blew up the engine in the 675LT? I’m a little confused with the timeline
The avengers of YouTube are rallying behind Freddy!
“Hello guys, we are here in a garage next to a 675lt and a P1. Where is Freddie?”😂😅
I wanna see some about that evo 8!!!
Yellow submarine 😂
Freddy is just the loveliest person, great video to go along with the start of his series on the P1.
if any one can rebuild that mac Freddy can and will !
Congratulations
FANTASTIC video!!   Nice to see  you two together!!!!
Mat's Porsche in the back looks quite good
men this video was recorded months ago ahah ! nice see it anyway
If McLaren does come to the party and helps him with the rebuild...that could save him zillions
Wait, so Freddy purchased the P1 before the 675LT broke? Ouch...
Its a lithium battery Even with everything disconnected It can still short via the dendrite formation ! only thing its got going for it other than the swim in salt water is its only had one or two charges Not long enough to build dendrites
Also I lived through that storm as well... it was a once in a lifetime storm as I'm told I had only lived there for a month... then BAM... we ran to hide in Miami only to come back to devastation on another level... only to leave again back to Miami cause we had no power for over a week after coming back in total it was a month of hotels in Miami... and still haven't gotten everything fixed yet at home... it's  just insane how bad that storm was..........
Everyone subscribe to Tavarish just to help him do this task. At least, he's trying to save an icon and let us see it happen in real time. He deserves it for being a car guy and just putting it all on the line for US to see it be done...
McLaren should help him at this point. Would drive the social attention away (for a while) from their dismal F1 team.
My dream car is a hand built Superlite cars Ford GTR. But I'm a simple man.
👍
Surfboard Florida P! style.
I hope Mclaren decides to be involved in this, the visibility of this project is so good for them and helping with this would really be a really good marketing for them.
This is exactly like one of those lost F40 rebuilds (Iraq and the GasMonkey one). They will ALWAYS pay for themselves with the commitment given to them.
There are many many technicians out there that will fix your battery pack, down to the cell level, for a LOT cheaper than US$150k!!!! And remember Freddie - you are the warranty!
Shmee is that friend you don’t want to have around when you are having a bad day 😂😂 rubbing everything in
Too bad that blue Mclaren LT is now dead too!!!
It's prolly almost as big as the Bugatti that went in the river
It might be ironic if this P1 actually appreciates in value since it has all the amazing history. Can’t wait to see it done.
So crazy its worth allmost 600k!!!!!!!!!!!!
I remember the Ferrarri that was passed around form goonsquad to other youtubers . Maybee you can try that with your new project  ?
Did you fix the engine Tavarish?
There always an idiot to every fool
I believe is time to help financially, this guy with his repair!!
I was under the impression that the 675LT had blown the engine... You guys are confusing us with the way you posting videos!!!! lol
@shmee150  what watch are you wearing?
Tavarish is a smart man, getting all is pals to do videos on this so he gets more views and subs, nice 😉
this is before the engine blowing up 😢
Idk why but The McLaren car  is a woman made out of carbon fiber I supposes lol. Fucking sexy. First u stare then u just want to get inside lmfao😅
Omg all you guys made more than he paid for the car in just 3 videos 😂😂😂
Damnnn  Wish tavarish was my friend bet he gonna let you drive whenever it's done 🎉🎉
The company that ruined your wheel and tire did they compensate you for the damaged they caused ?
Was this video recorded before the blown engine or after?
I believe Tavarish will have this done rather quickly!
Fish bowl headlights! 😂 It happens!
Wow. Good Lord is this gonna be a huge $$$ pit. Their is a reason nobody else wanted to buy this. Anything can be rebuilt but this won't be remotely cheap. Unless your getting huge discounts on parts and a flood of $$$ to help offset costs, no normal person could afford this. Another level of crazy above this would be the intentionally flooded bugatti veyron ed bolian tried to purchase. Should be fun to see how this racks up the $$$. Personally, I would take a McLaren p1. I'm guessing Freddie must have a much better relationship with McLaren on getting rare parts and them wanting it back on the road. And his previous experience building a McLaren already. Epic rebuild for sure with many many $$$ surprises ! Thanks Tim! Hope your first in line to get a ride and a free container of sand!
$1000 for a wheel is a bargain!!! I got quoted £1150 for a new alloy for my Audi A5 a few years back 😂😂😂
I thought the LT engine was blown. Trying to figure out where this video lies on the YouTube timeline? 🙂
I love his enthusiasm
This must have been quite a while ago since the 675LT is blown up again 😂
That’s wild I cruise those roads 😂
Awww community P1
Tavarish is my hero!!!
True FLA man stories
This is before this car went boom....
I take it this was before he blew the 675 up lol
If there's anybody on YouTube who could do this it's definitely Freddy! I remember back in the day when he was going to put the manual transmission in an SL500 and I thought that was crazy. You've got a hell of a long way Freddy!!
Vammoss 🔥
Wait… the LT engine is fixed already? Or is this an old video? I’m confused 😮
Well, he could win a series of cartrek with it. ( As Freddie so often uses his own stock )
These videos must be out of sequence of events because the 675LT is still running in this video and we already know he blow that up.
Freddy certainly has some loose screws, but if anyone can pull this off it's him.
Thumbs up for shmees sunglasses getting thrown backwards there 👍 😂
Can’t get over the shmee tavarish collab, two of the nicest, most down to earth, car loving, YouTubers together in harmony.. need to see a lot more of this on both channels please guys.
Fabrieksnieuw
He should use the sand from the car and give it to someone to make a wall art or a sign that says McLaren P1 and put it in his garage. That would be epic.
"There is a thin line between genius and madness" Freddy regularly break dances on that line. 😎
hey freddy, who's is that cbr1000rr?
The most expensive canoe in the world - I can't wait to see it finished...
Cheers for the video guys 😎 👌
Nothing stupid in it. Literally vid jumping off a hill 😂
Think its actually a "good thing" that the 675 engine exploded. Now he can put a 720 engine and would be the fastest 675 on the world
What are the odds ... as soon as Freddy buys the P1, the LT throws a rod!? I'm wondering at this point if the LT is going to end up being a donor.
29:00 I know nobody care but that signature is perfect 😄
I get so pissed when I hear prices like that.. how in the hell can anybody justify a windshield worth 13.000 dollars?!!! A 170.000 dollar battery?! It's glass and a damn battery!!
He jokes about giving away sand  but I would love to buy a part off that car
Crazy that from this video it seems that the 675LT engine was blown after he had already bought the P1, he just hadn't revealed that he had bought the P1 when it happened!
💙💙💙🌹
brother i would love a bottle of sand i love u brother u got this try to reach out to manny kosbin and see if he would sell u his artic white shell
The balls on tavarish are god like for rebuilds I doubt even some of the mclaren staff would be sceptical on this
Ahh yes Freddie finish it! And you and tim great combo!
Tavarish redefines the budget for a "fixer upper"
how old is this viedo he blew that car up
Freddy is an Adventurous, take risks kind of guy, daring, amazing. God bless you all in your personal lives and in your business life. I am enjoying the videos, thanks.
Law of Attraction !!!!!
This was before the engine blew on the 670 because if you look at the A Pillar it’s still a bit crooked which Tavarish fixed the day the engine blew RIP to that engine
its a P1 so its a very iconic car So with money and dedication maybe he can rebuild the car
I guess this is before the LT engine blow lol
dry ice cleaning is awesome
All YouTubers talks about this Tavarish P1. It will be easy build 😁
Like
Seems everyone is trying to cash in on the back of taverish and his recent purchase. Makes sense from a business point of view but OMG. If I want to know what taverish is doing I watch his videos!
If Freddie does the p1 and make it immaculate... I think we should start a fund for the flooded veyron, we all know which one
All I’m thinking is, who rides the bike? 🤣
why did shmee have the cleanest signature ever
this is the third video from three different channel I watched in 24 hours about tavarish new flooded car, I love it!!
Wow the 675LT before it bent its rods and exploded spectacularly a few months ago. Good old times 😀
that bucket handle cant hold 96 lbs! And he isn't lifting it with one hand!40 pounds maybe not 40 kilos!
Sadly he now has two broken McLarens 😜
Doesn’t matter if the relay is removed, the battery is still a time bomb. Salt water is very corrosive, and I doubt that battery is sealed or IP rated
Definitely Legendary
You can already hear a weird sound from the engine in this video, it's backfiring and soft knocking.
Freddy can pull a whistlin Diesel and sell jars of sand to his subs 😂😂😂
The sand ideas are smart
so why would you not move your 2 mill car when you know a hurricane hits and will flod the place?
Call Manny, he has an entire spare body
looks like my car in gta 5 after driving it for 10seconds lol
I feel when he gets it done a good amount of people with deep pockets LoL are going to want to try to offer him a good chunk of money to buy this p1 to have 300 mi plus restored flood damaged P1 this thing might end up in a museum. I wouldn't be surprised if McLaren would want to buy it from him to put it in there museum. Just amazing so hyped He's got a perfect slate to go anywhere .He can race car it, he can completely restore it whatever he wants to do, he can build it into a 2000 horsepower beast anything sky is the limit this is awesome.
The cue outside Freddy's place of all the car YouTubers has to be wrapping around the block at this point.
What a brave man 🫡👏👏👏
This is a very exciting build but I can’t wait to see some progress made on the Porsche on the lift!
That's 1 out of 375 P1 in existence right there.
finally!!
I'm 200 percent sure Freddy is going to fix it and keep it for himself, That guy is so stubborn he'd do it just to prove everyone wrong.. Love from India Shmee and Freddy
seems Tavarish has a hit on his hands...took the YouTube Rebuilds to a whole new level. cant wait to see how this turns out
so this video is from before you granaded the motor?
I hope he keeps it in the volcano yellow 🙏
The whole Automotive 'community' should applaud this guy, what a journey is about to begin! 😊
Also, this video must be filmed weeks ago, which completely throws off a few video timelines for a few channels like this one right now, because the engine is def blown to hell in the 675LT yet no tin this video which is less than 24-hours ago. God I hope Teddy doesnt ruin this project.
So he previewed the project on Mat's channel, here, and his own channel. We wanna see the work start! he started cleaning it and working on it because it was on another channel without the sand all over it but I really hope he doesn't mess up and not release material, hording it for just like two or three large videos like he's known to do.
Lets go content!  Get it, everyone jump in!
This is going to be one hell of a build, fingers crossed 🤞 👍👍👍👍
Good thing you got a ride in the 675 when you did 😬
Was this before the 675LT blew up? Or has @tavarish already fixed it?
2 GOATS 🐐
RiP 675LT engine. 😢
Another great video from two of my favorites! Hey Tim, I've been seeing that amazing watch in a lot of your recent videos. What is it?!
I'm going to watch every video on every channel about Freddy and this car.  So good
ill be watching... this is insane... a P1... dam
The Ferrari Daytona seats in the Mac... I don't know about that ma... thats sacred Ferrari tradition there.
The P1 deserves to live again.  It's literally 1 of 3 Mclarens that are anyway exciting  Senna, Sabre and P1.
Tavarish, you are the best! Good luck!
Man great job on the blue car, my favorite color too even to the shade 🤩👌 subbed because I wanna see that beutifull P1 roll again and I'm in love with it lol 👍
Saw the p1 on the back of a wrecker after the hurricane and it broke me to this day
At 4:52 on a rainy day, won't the water go in through the gap?
For anyone that doesn't know or is wondering why or how is the 675 LT working and running those videos were 2 months old the videos that were Uploaded by tavarish so he has quite a bit of content that he hasn't Uploaded yet so we are pretty far up on the P1 journey
“there are pictures of it floating around, quite literally” 😂😂
I hope Freddy hybrid deletes the P1, maybe get a 1000hp engine tune??
Wait, is this in the past? Thought the Blue McLaren was blown up?
I wonder when this was recorded? Will have to be 3months old or cause the LT isnt wrecked yet
Giving away sand in bottles? Does any "bath" water come with it?  Wonder where you got that idea from?
Excellent collaboration! I already follow Tavarish, but you've made me more of a fan today. I already watched the first video in this series, and I can't wait for the build.
This is crazy lol
Which colour He will choose or will the P1 stay yellow?😊
I too am worried about the hybrid system. I wonder if it’s recoverable.
That LT didn't age well lol, im sure he'll rebuild the engine better tho
I bet freddies nipples are like pencil erasers.
Two GOATs of youtube !
Wait a minute, is that blue McLaren up and running yet? 3 days ago Freddy showed the engine was garbage. He fixed it so quickly?
17:15 don't worry that's actually the blinker fluid!
Freddy laughs about things you should cry about.
Can not wait to see the video of him starting this thing up after he somehow fixes it.
Take the battery to rich rebuilds and get them to fix it!
Question: so the dry ice cleaning process, Tavarish said it fired tiny dry ice pellets, so it’s like sandblasting but the “sand” is solid carbon dioxide and it just dissipates?
Ah a weird YouTube timing thing. I’ve just seen the video for the p1, but I already know that LT has exploded. 🤔
Tavarish must have a line of utubers 20 miles long trying to get in on the action
That paper roll is now worth hundreds
WE ALL SUPPORT TO REBUILD THIS MONSTER McLaren P1....Congratulations🎉❤
What a project only you would take this on  Can’t wait for the next instalment 👍
The timeline is all screwed up with his 675 still working but just having gotten the P1
I hope freddie brings this to europe and do the whole England to Eastern europe thing and back with the boys
Freddie is such a likeable dude. This project is absolutely mad. I cant wait to see him pull this off.
When did you make this video, because Freddy crashed the engine nearly a month ago, so I am an bit confused about your video?
This would need the help from Vicegrip Garage and totally AMMO NYC
Only rivaled by the Gas Monkey's Ferrari F40
This dudes buying views
"I'm not gonna freak out over something I can easily fix"  Car: and I took that personally
Sand filled shift knob.
I generally can't stand this slone boy tossers channel but had to view this cause this restoration is going to be epic. When it's done take it to Middle East on its way to the UK and let that little brown man flog it around the track along with the Ferrari and Porche that he flogged in that truly epic episode, just to see this amazing piece of engineering live again and do what it was built to do. Will always remember that hyper car comparison and the P1 spinning its rears at 200mph and the little brown many saying that was the experience of a life time to flog all three around the track.
Tavarish’s youtube channel gonna blow up noww📈📈
i remember seeing this on instagram when it happened
is the drive in the lt before or after he blow up the engine
This made me realize that Shmee hasn't driven his 675LT in a whole while
Batteries not included...😲
Makes you want to cry, I wouldn't know where to start. Brave man.
Oh so the mclaren was running then lol
You can hear the pain in shmees voice when he looks inside 😅
Slap a v12 in it that will be other worlds super
You know the level of humbleness from Tim is absolutely next level, this dude is amazing!!
Leave the car in the sun with everything off and open it usually works
I wish him all the best! I really hope he gets all the help to complete the project!
It can be done, but without the hybrid system.  The cost to rebuild the hybrid system will kill the project.
This is going to be EPIC!
Freddy is about to create the greatest YouTube car rebuild video in the history of YouTube. This is going to be amazing.
C00L video, McLaren being in contact with Freddy is a very nice touch. P1 GTR build ??? I will be looking forward to seeing the video of both your McLarens driving in Mayfair or Kings Rd.
Matt Armstrongs Porsche in the background 👀
What kind of watch are you wearing? Very cool.
Didn't you just blew a hole in the engine, and break / bend the rods with the blue McLaren in another video?
Should McLaren reach out to Freddie to help??? Surely it would be great PR??
Is this a GOOD TIME to bring up the fact that Manny Khoshbin is NOW SELLING HIS FULL CARBON McLaren P1? That P1 is absolutely Magnificent!
The twin turbo gallardo, the murcielago. And much more. The Mclaren is testimony to your brilliants to achieve.
Awesome you can find parts and repair it, i think Ferrari don't let anyone to do that
Easily the most exciding car on You Tube right now, this rebuild is going to be epic.
Tim... until Freddy has the P1 running & driving "properly," let's continue to call it Ernie's McLaren P1. The 765LT turned out Fantastic!! I'm really hoping that the P1 can & will be repaired. Wishing Freddy Tavarish much success on the McLaren P1!
Nice green watch ! What brand is that ? Probably on par with the cars
I remember when Tím was there after Tavarish buy damaged McLaren 675 long tail 😅. And now P1. I have Deja Vu 😅
Body seems decent and easily fixable. Electronics is gonna be difficult and time consuming. Financially I hope he can get sponsors to help which I think he will with the amazing story this P1 has. Good Luck.
We need shmees 675lt back on the channel more, it’s such a great car
Didn't he grenade the engine on the blue Mclaren ?? Then bought the P1, How is it running
yike this one is the hybrid one so more electronics hopefully they are sealed systems and dont have to worry about slow death of electronics cause of slow corrosion that will keep going on if salt or water did touch the electronic component !
so this is an Old video. since the 675lt is still in good condition.
Freddy is making the situation way better lol
I'm sorry I never subbed earlier Mr smhee , I'm here now tho 😂
Why don't you just get the new updated battery. It's lighter and packs more kw.
He absolutely has to call it a  YELLOW SUBMARINE !!!
I wish Freddie all the luck in the world. It would be cool for mclaren to get involved some how👍
What about the title I thought couldn’t drive on roads?
This video has aged poorly since the 675 engine has been dead for a while.
Didn't the engine of the LT blew?
So happy to see the project underway😊😊
Funny how all the you tubers are making money after travarish got this new build. Trying to make money off his channel lol. I think it’s funny
Tavarish has like a car collection yet a garage that revives cars from the dead.
So this obviously was filmed awhile ago before he Nuked that motor lol
Tavarish talking about the 675lt “everything in the engines fixed”
freddy it's cool, i just wish he stopped pretending he is poor on every video (while buying a p1) . He has a succesful yt channel and is loaded good for him!
im so excited to see this car again. its awesome that your going to rebuild it. cant wait to see when its done. also i would love to get some of that sand. send me a message back plz so i can send you my info. thanks freddy.
I remember way back when you started your twin turbo gallardo just look at you now.  Well done sir you are for sure the warranty
He probably put it back together so the pannel gaps look spot on too,which doesn't come standard 😊
Best project on YouTube
man that 765 lt  is running so good, i hope nothing bad ever happens to it.
Thankyou Tim for this Tavarish interview, very helpful questions and well presented, cheers.
That Mclaren 675 isn't running any more.
If someone else funded me I'd be glad to take on this project myself.  And it'd start with a rapid but very carefully documented disassembly of EVERYTHING, with the idea being to wash out all contaminants and get every part as clean as possible, as quickly as possible, as damage control.  And then start sending off such items as electronic modules to specialists who are experts in salvaging and repairing electronics that have experienced water damage.
this is 7+ week old content lol k
This would be nice if it went to AMMO NYC for a good clean up after.
smell-wise might be ok if he can ozone it once he replaces the windshield
I wouldnt touch that with a  500m stick !   This car will never come back to life working at 100%   It will stay in his garage  forever like all his cars !!!   And his 675 lt is dead tooo that cant be good for his wallet !
Saddly Tavarish has now 2 Mclarens to rebuild...😢
But is this blue one engine fixed?
Obviously all scripted and staged.
I’d love to help him rebuild it🔥🔥
Yeah... this is massive. Next? LFA crashed built? Just putting it out there
Godseed Freddie! This should be fun to watch 🙂
When was this originally recorded? Freddie's 675 has a huge hole in the block right now.
I can't believe i've already followed him ever since his time at Jalopnik and his first video of buying Doug's V8 Vantage.. How times flies now my man is rebuilding a P1!
I know he is the man for this undertaking but he is nut for doing it. 😂
Last I heard, the blue McLaren blew its engine a few days ago. You post this now? Bad timing..
It’s already done history in the making the guy is a legend
Shmee killing the signature!
Spreading the journey across key YouTube channels is smart…❤
So cool that Shmee and Freddy are so down to earth!  I wish Freddy the best with this build and can't wait to see the results!  Some other channels have talked alot of crap but im more impressed with effort then just buying and selling a car!  Great content!
Tavarish is like that one Rizzler homie that just keeps pulling badder and badder females
Actually by the end Tavarish is going have special knowledge/experience w McLarens..#dope #crashcourse
wow that 675LT came out spectacular
He did my idea! He collected the sand!💙
He's got 2 Mclarens to rebuild now😰😰
Imagine being the guy that bought it with 310 miles then got it home in the garage only to have a hurricane take it for its first ride. 🤢
WAIT... didn't Freddie also blow up the 675LT too?   Dang 2 McLaren's.... WOW
F1 style LT meter! is that MSO!? No wonder it looke diff!
finally the ever elusive blinker fluid!!
The Copart listing said the P1 has a destruction title. How do you plan to get it back "on the road" without a donor body/VIN?
i see matt's gt3 is still being worked on :)
Foreshadowing with the upgraded engine talk 😬
He is definitely the perfect person to get this car back on the road . He is like genius at rebuilding things.
I would love to know, if the income from YouTube would cover most of the rebuild cost. Personally I think it's a stroke of genius buying this car and rebuilding it, coverage and content he will get from this will sky rocket his YouTube status. Wishing him all the luck in the world and I hope mclaren come to the party and help out or at least not make it difficult for him
Wasn't the blue McLarens motor blown with a hole in the block?  Fixed already? Is there a video on the fix?
Lmao.. not much gets you off guard Tim, but love the fact you get in contact with everyone cool on YouTube.  By far very awesome. I'm surprised Tavarish was driving that car, I thought he blew engine.  But happy he was driving it around.. I can not wait till he puts that car back together.   I'm glued to see that! Awesome Tim as always!!
If I had the money I would rebuild this after I buy it as well too.
Has Freddy replaced the engine yet on his 675LT?
You know what i dont get.. if i got the type of money to buy a p1 i would have a lift system in my garage to store my car up from the ground, its well know that there are major floods in florida all the time... that previous owner was not so smart
Regardless if that car ever Runs again People buy paintings and art for many millions and imo that would be an amazing piece of ART and was only 585k us
I would love to see Tavarish collab with Ben from VTuned Garage on this car. He could be essential on rebuilding this. He stripped down every nut and bolt from a McLaren, down to the bare carbon tub and rebuilt a car on another tub. This car really needs to be stripped down to that degree.
Hey didn’t he blow the motor on that car in a video he posted like 2 weeks ago
A quote comes to mind from Tom Cruise's "Risky Business": "Who's the U boat commander?".....
Was this before Freddy blew up the 675lt?
shmee casually rocking his RM 🤤
Shmee150 Awesome Video I think it's awesome that Freddie plans on Fixing up the Infamous Flood Damaged P1 and I can't wait to watch the build process
I thought gis 675lt has broken engine?
A flood damage P1 is still a P1.  and lets be clear about flood damage and damage in general.  outside of some items on a car that MUST be replaced, ironically and contrary to popular belief , cars from flood damage can be restored.  it all depends on the type of water its been submerged in.  ala, clear brackish, sandy,  fresh or salt water, the amount of time within the water and the time out in the sun, and what parts will likely be saturated by the water.  YES sand is an issue too.. especially southern florida powder white gulf coast sand which are extremely small crystals and virtually impossible to rid away without the use of.. guess... Water! lol,   but unless you do something INCREDIBLY STUPID like trying to start a flood car before its been completely torn down and cleaned out,  then youd be surprised how such things can be recovered.  cars are designed to withstand moderate amounts of water. Rain and heavy splash water, even to a degree driving thru moderate water.  again not smart at all but we've seen incredible feats of survivability with cars going thru water.  dont try this at home.
Imagine this video was taken before the 675LT engine blew up.
He must have got the loan from Silicon Valley Bank.  🤣
Gotta love Tim's usual reserve briefly replaced by "(Freddy what are you...)" 🙂
Ok…. I’m confused! I thought the 675LT’s engine blew out just before buying the flooded P1. He just talked about finding a short block.   What have I missed?
Wow!!!!!  What a project!
Electrified Garage will be doing their first P1 battery replacement soon , Hi Rich
The McLaren 675 part of the video didn't age well.
Car enthusiasts all over the world are rooting for Tavarish to make this Maclaren great again. If anyone can do this it is him.
He should bottle up some of that water in the light and do something cool with it… maybe put it in some sort of desk ornament or jewelry
Quick question: Can you even rebuild a P1 in this condition for cheaper than you could just buy new? Lmao.
"I can lean on this car, I can drive it daily..." yeah, and a few weeks later it's waiting for a replacement for a severely blown up engine.   First rule of adding horsepower:  Make very sure the engine has the internals to handle the boost.  Upgrade them if needed.
Tavarish 675lt now has exposed piston!
These 2 have a great personality, respect and love for their craft  Love when they colab
You should sell the sand for $10-$20 .Great keepsake with a small Letter of Authenticity . Would help pay for Some of you're restorations.
jeez this walk around the 675LT aged like a fine milk. Two McLaren rebuilds on one channel might just be the mother of all YouTube projects
I’ve watched Shmee for a long long time (could say since the Aventador crash video), and all videos has been spectacular. But this one hits different; two car “GURUS”, two absolute geniuses, praising each other along the way with utmost respect and passion…this is special. Love the fact that Shmee got invited to drive the crazy beast and I wholeheartedly wish and pray that, this build goes amazing and that simply Iconic P1, the most famous P1 in existence right now breathes FIRE. And @Shmee150, please collab with your brother and do a video on your first attempt to startup the beast. That’d be epic. Hats off I must say. Massive respect and can’t wait to watch till the end.
I want to make shift knobs out of the sand
Please leave that color
You can do it Freddy!! So looking forward to hearing this roar on youtube!!👌🏼🙌🏼💥
Oooooh, I didn't realize he bought the P1 _before_ the 675LT blew up. That makes a little more sense.
Shmee should sell his entire collection and get a MSO Cerulean Blue P1 haha
First time i saw the P1 floating me and i think a lot of other people already knew it would end up with Freddy. Like you said not many other people would undertake a project like this. But better that Freddy has it and you know it get's finished instead of someone just buying it thinking he can buy it and get it running under a million and it ending up trading hands over and over or just in a garage and never been seen again.
Freddy did such an amazing job on the 675lt. I know that he is capable of bringing the p1 back to life
that thing should be in 1mil parts by now.
Fortune and glory...fortune and glory...
This is epic
@rich rebuild and @eliectricfie Garage May be avale to help you with the Battery.
Tavares stated on another video yesterday I saw from 2UK YouTube's one was ratarosa and there was another guy anyways tavar stated that he. Thinks he could rebuild this car for a 100 K USD. I think there's no way. I think he's in it for at least 250 to 350 usd
Freddy loves that gold tinfoil.
At this rate tavarish could just start building his own HyperCars
Seeing the blue McLaren next to you, reminds me how much you need more McLarens.
It's not like Hurricanes just appear like a tornado does.  You have a couple of days minimum to realize it's coming. Tow the damn thing to Atlanta for a day or two, but nope, you didn't...now Freddy owns it.
I really hope McLaren supports him with parts. Maybe not warranty, but parts. Let Freddie finish this project. It will be good PR for McLaren.
You should save some of that water in the headlight. Maybe some commemorative bottle or something as a hurricane tribute for that car
Freddy, or no one! He’s got the balls, the knowledge and the passion to rebuild this P1…. Mark my word, SEMA 2023 will be center stage for this piece of automotive art!
homie got in the exploded lt
A Gen2 P1 Battery has a MSRP of $156,700.00.  This will be the most expensive car build next to a classic Ferrari full restoration.
The “tig brush “ can be done fairly easy at home with a car battery , some jumper cables , a piece of aluminum for a brush handle , some strands of carbon fiber as the bristles of the brush and some osphoric acid . I have done it for a custom exhaust I made for my motorcycle.
Aye yo free sand!!! I want!
The 675LT may or may not have blown the f' up after this was shot...
Freddy is a legend!
Come to Malaysia and learn from our mechanics on how to sort out a floor damaged vehicle......easy peasy.
beautiful p1 but whats up w the kenworth lol!
you know this car is going to better than new after Freddie and co have finished with it . Freddie does go above and beyond on the projects he finishes 😅 good luck Freddie cant wait to the finished car
Everywhere I look, Shmee’s just poppin in everyone’s videos… ChrisFix, Tavarish, Stradman, etc. 😂
i mean sure things will be expensive, but he can just tally up the money for what everything will cost him, and maybe hopefully get everything done as like a new one for half the price right, and the value of the P1 will only go up
Ahh.. the great 675LT before the.. “happenings”.
Top man Freddy. Best of luck to him with the build
17:14 ah yes, Tavarish needs to top off his blinker fluid.j
FREDDY: Whats that smell like. SHMEE: Humm, Yaa😂😂
Gotta love Freddy. Wish him all the best and can’t wait to see this build completed.
Schmee’s watch looks super cool, does anyone know what it is called
Come on Shmee, that's free sand, how can you argue McLaren sand? Free McLaren sand.😅
That 675LT is nice, hopefully Freddy don't break it or anything...
Love the roof scoop intake sounds on the 675LT!
If this comes to Europe (say in 2-3 years) I am going to see it, no matter what.
I hope Freddy takes it to Woking when it's finished and wears an I am the warranty shirt.
Tarvish is a global treasure. I wish there was some way I could chip in with some elbow grease. As twisted as it is to say he IS living the dream.
Make sure all of the mold is out of the interior.  Get it tested. That mold will ruin your life, possibly kill you its so toxic.
It sucks that it seems like while all these guys were there (hard Up, Ratarosa, etc.) that the 675's engine blew up, so now on top of this beast of a project he's gotta fix the engine of his previous biggest project. I guess the upside is that he had lots of friends to keep his spirits up and Freddy is usually a pretty upbeat guy, but still that's a gut punch.
I am so confused - the LT is now in shambles - the channels are messing me up!!!
omg this is the most amazing thing ever Tavrish is the man. All the support from everyone on youtube this is going to be epic
Sexy CBR1000
Freddie is a legend for doing this, as are you!  Thank you for this great video and look forward to watching the progress and then when he brings it to the UK and you guys hit the road.  Brilliant!
Ooof. This is basically a parts car. I really hope Freddy can fix this one. That last mclaren was in a way better shape electronics wise. And with this P1 the salt water will bite him in the butt. But at least it will produce nice content!!!
15:25 Tim turned into Mater for a second there
I saw this man some time ago, when he was building a Gallardo, I think... But this project is just mad. Stunning and mad. I really hope that he pulls it through
Freddie's workshop is like the UN of car U Tube, everyone eventually ends up there, just an awesome project to come, Rj in Oz
LOVING THE SNEAK PEAK after seeing his video! Thanks Shmee! Love your channel!
What a glorious project! I can't wait to watch every step of the challenge
didn't Tavarish blow the engine in this thing?
i thought the LT blew a while ago?
Good thing you film this before the engine blow up. At least we still can have some great footage out of its last few run.
How soon after this was shot did the LT grenade itself?
Can we maybe get some better mics? I think there is some room for improvement on audio, especially with these cars.
The F1 that you guys keep mentioning is in Naples at the Revs Institute!!!! Same city that the yellow P1 did it's swimming scene!
So sad to see the 675LT in this video knowing it’s future
It comes included with free sand that’s a plus
McLarens only marketing scheme, a hurricane brilliant...
dident the engine in the 675LT blow out? he allready fixed it??
Shmee LOL...how long has it been since youve been home 😂
Can't even fix that 675 Lt right 😅😅 good luck with the P1 tho 😂
So this is Before he BlewUp the 675 engine 😮😮
I’m almost thinking that he’s plan is to remove the electric power train of the P1 and keep only to be a combustion engine only🤔
I thought you put a hole in the bottom end of that one.  You fixed it that fast or did I miss that video?
Cannot wait to see the updates, much love from south africa
So how long after this video did he blow up the engine?
Poor Car
It's awesome seeing this rebuild genuinely promoted like this, I think we're all rooting for Freddy!
Interesting fact, in Russian Tovarish is Friend , i guess Freddy have some russian relatives)
Red MC12 on the right 👀 Them things are going to rocket in value, they are getting so popular and rightly so, proper drivers car
i hope he fix  this beautiful car that was damaged in flood good video tim.
Welp..it doesn't need a blinker fluid refill.. oh wait.. that's not blinker fluid.. lol
I think it would be great if he got it running but kept the non-functional damaged parts like the body panels on there.
Disconnecting those batteries do not make them safe.  The problem is internal and a short from sea water can cause a thermal runaway and you cannot put it out until it burns itself out.
Freddy is a badass!!!
Freddy should rebuild it as a P1 GTR
he manage to rebuild the Lambo from F&F....i am sure he can rebuild this 1 olso....
You guys are so cool! 👍
Dude got balls to do this! Serious a legend
20:31 More chance get yer 1st. daiper back... 2 YT LEGENDS
Tavarish, shmee and DDE do an colab video with this car and maybe DDE wrecked lambo? Be an awesome colab to see.
You need to go see Cleetus some time
Get mat Armstrong on the rebuild with you pleaseee !!! 🙌🙌
I confused...well besides the fact that I could never figure out where shmee is in the world..lol....  I thought tavarish 765 engine exploded
Now it makes sence why LT engine grenaded, Shmee was in it before that, its the Shmee curse😂
Previous owner had a week to move the car, but he choose not to. He couldn't afford the car so he did insurance froud. Simple as that
If Humans made it? Super-Humans can do ANYTHING with it. Love this. I drive a JAG.
The yellow submarine💀
Both you guys are Legends!
Its s win win situation youtube will pay sponsors will help he gets a new P1 as long as he doesn't give up
This is by far the biggest and most popular car and rebuild project on the internet right now 🔥
I remember seeing him write articles for jalopnik then him and Doug demuro have gone to do what they are doing now pretty cool
The tow truck driver should be identified and fired.
Fred NEEDED this car 🚗!  Fred now has a Yellow 🟡 Submarine 😋. Best of luck with it.
Nothing like taking on a potentially bankrupting project while doing an engine swap on his 675!? Videos a tad out of sync! Cheers!
I wish he would do a P1 GTR build on this car.
seawater edition p1 🤣
This is outrageous but so so good can’t wait to see this build and how it ends up 👍👍 I’m sure McLaren UK are watching closely
He got that repaired quickly...
If Tavarish has enough sponsors + add revenue this still going to cost a s##tload of money. Best of luck.
Fred will need to retire the channel after this one
Was this video before his 765 blew and engine 🧐
Bigger is not always better. Electrical makes this one super sketch
bro just had to do one thing, CALL MORS MUTUAL INSURANCE.  "With Mors it's Mutual!"
i cant belive Tavarish is gonna own a (working) P1 one day. thats just crazy man
What an honor to sign first 💯🤷‍♂️but then again who else better on YouTube 😁
Freddy is great he always makes me smile when I watch him😊 great video Tim 👍👍
At this moment Freddy's channel will blow up again!!! Congratulations 👏👏
If it was easy, everybody would be doing it 👍🏻
Well no one thought saving the world would be cheap..... 150k for a battery????!
Wonder if it has a reserve
For that money, wouldn’t it be more interesting to see a third party build a battery for the P1? I recon it should be possible…
ITS A CAR YOU FUCKING IDIOTS LEAVE A FEW DAYS IN THE SUMMER HEAT AND ITLL START RIGHT THE FUCK UP
Freddie is the man that can make it happen.
so many spoilers in this video!! I want the update video from Tavarish :D
Fantastic! Probably too late for the GT Black but a lap at LZ and at Freedom Factory would be a good time.
Exactly what I commented on Tavarish's P1 video....McLaren WANT these amazing cars on the road! He's great publicity for 'normal' folk to get into these cars! Good on him....what a guy!!!!
Floodp1 needs to be the plate number for that car😂😂😂😊
Have you ever thought of doing a video on every car you have driven as you have driven more super / hyper cars than anyone in the world in so many different countries Shmee????
Freddie is a mad man and always delivers great content. Thank you, Tim, for getting us in on the ground floor of this insane peoject.
Would love too see Larry from AMMO NYC help you with the cleaning process!
Didn't the 675lt just get engine damage? Unless this was filmed before
Wish him all the luck in the world if there was any car that deserves to be saved its that P1 with only 300miles on the clock the engine isnt even run in yet !!
I thought that Mclaren 675LT blew up
Freddy is far too humble !
I'm glad that punched the p1 ..if any body can bring it back it is boss man tavarish...can't wait to see you work on it and im sure you got this good luck bro
Such a positive guy all the best with this amazing machine 👍👍
Since you have a lot of sand why not make a part of the interior out of glass.
Best quote “I like, don’t do anything stupid with it…” and then blows the engine weeks later 😂😢 13:44
this youtube screws with your head, Freddie only picked up P1 2 days ago, blew up is 675 ages ago, now 675 is fine and P1 is in bits (more bits)???
Buying a Mclaren P1 and eleven days later Mother Nature forks you over, that hurts, financially and emotionally
Fantastic
I totally believe that Freddie can fix it. I am more concerned about the Florida Certificate of Destruction which states that it can't be repaired and put back on the road
@15:10 famous last words
I think everyone is excited for Freddie and I can’t wait to see this beast roar again
nuts --- in a good way
how we know this is from a couple months ago... that 675LT doesn't have three huge holes in the engine block hahaha
23:01 THAT'S WHAT I SAID ON TAVVIE'S VIDEO! Keep a little thing filled with seawater as a memento of this car's storied history! ME AND SHMEE THINK ALIKE BABIE! 😂
Here we go again with mic levels 😅
I can guarantee you that this McLaren P1 going to be a million dollars to restore/Rebuild 💛 but I'm all for it to get this beautiful P1 back on the road, You are Lucky it's just a flooded Hyper car and not a P1 wrapped around a 🌲. I follow every vlog and I can't wait to see the finishing touches.
I saw one exactly like this one driving on the motorway close to Southampton in 2015 ❤️ i was like  is that a P1? OMFG its a P ooooone ❤️
"I've never been in one that's BROUGHT THE BEACH WITH IT"...  That might have been the hardest laugh I've had from a Shmee joke in  years and YEARS of watching. 🤣
Lurve it! Peter U.K.
This leaves the flood damaged Veyron behind.
My hat is definitely off to that gentleman. He sounds to me like he’s definitely got the attitude to take on and successfully complete the chore. I wish him well.👍👍🇨🇦
What an epic collaboration video.  Few automotive YouTubers have the connections and reach that Tim and the Shmee150 franchise has.  This will bring this fascinating story to light in so many new places.  And Freddie will need the exposure to offset the epic costs of this project.
Freddie need to get vanity plates that say HURRICANE in some abbreviation.
How Much he paid?
snowmans kenworth looking gorgeous
It’s eerie seeing the LT still running after we know what happened to it in present tense…
Perhaps this needed an explanation that this video is old I assume to wait for Freddie’s but we all know about that engine failure
Don't know how long the project will be long. Probably at least a year. Let's hope less than 2. Anyway it's going to be hell of a work. Can't wait to see the final product and all the personal mods!
at first glance it looks like a neglected kit car P1
haha, Service limit 1900 days exceeded
Seeing Tavarish rebuild his P1 alongside Damon's murcielago is going to be a real treat 😁
How?, I thought the engine in the Lt had a hole in it😅
Props to the balls on Freddy! Massive respect I hope he gets her back to life again, he deserves it!
I hope Mclaren decides to be involved in this, the visibility of this project is so good for them and helping with this would really be a really good marketing for them.
Blue 675LT engine went bang bang long time ago
Epicness!
2:45 I think he meant to say "we WILL have" lol  Jokes aside, Freddy is amazing and I can't wait to see the P1 rebuilt, perhaps to a better standard than the original.
Absolutely brilliant! Best of luck to Tarvish. Kindest regards Tim, Richard U.K
Worlds most expensive JUNK YARD!
Wow, yesterday i watched a video with Mat Armstrong and Freddy. The engine in the 675 had a hole in it. Today its fixed and Schmee and Freddy are driving around in it!  What is happening!?
Thank you for this inspiring story! And good luck to Tavarish! The P1 in yellow with silver rims was the beautiful spec which inspired me to build my own dream version of it.
Next up: Taverish rebuilds Challenger shuttle
Craziest build to ever to be rebuilt
now it has a blowen engine 😂
TI gonna fuck around and end up being the fourth P1 specialist in the world and people will be calling him to work on them.
a noble project indeed , how much on top of the  $500k  you think he will need to spend  to complete ? I think maybe 3-400k ?
Cant wait to see the rebuild. I live really close to where the car was damaged
He’s gonna be in this car for 1.2 and whatever he paid. Then it won’t sell past 1.2
"It cost more to REPAIR a McLaren than it does to BUY a Ferrari" - Jay Leno👀👀
Tavarish got C-cups
The "Lord Of The Rings" of restorations.  Godspeed.
How Old is this video ?
Awesome video
Freddie & Shmee bromance is strong - So much in common & genuinely enjoy each others company - Love it when Tim visits  Freddy ❤
Didn’t the 675 blow up
If anyone can do it, Freddy can! Also, glad you got to rip in that McLaren before it grenaded.
Petition to donate $1 per person to Tavarish so he can get a P1 HDK kit as well! All the best Freddy!
Well done to Freddy if anyone can rebuild it he can, even Matt Armstrong would think twice about this one lol great vid Tim thanks👍
Luv to see great content from "The dynamic duo"...😊
You missed matt armstrong's GT3!!
It is amazing how YouTubers can buy a project and spend more money on it then buying a mint condition version and still make out like a bandit
This is the biggest most interesting rebuild in youtube history
The LT motor sounds good with pistons out.... Or is this an alternate timeline ?
It needs gold wheels to match all of the gold accents. The silver wheels clash with the rest of the car a bit.
I like this guy, he knows what’s up.
You are Right Tavarish is Both a Madman and Genius it the biggest Epic build ever taken on in Youtube if Tavarish pulls this off and the P1 is back on the road in time for that alone is the up most Deepest respect ever it proves they can come back to life and have a good home
Wonder if the previous owner had full insurance on that vehicle to get the refund
the video is before the blowing rod right?
I'm a bit lost...wasn't the 675lt engine supposed to be blown?
Oh hell mate it only took a drink didn't get smash like the 675 i didn't think he would pull that off and he did..it's not high speed impact..you can take any electric motor to a motor shop and replace it..batteries lots of people can replace the cell in the battery the prius has taught lots of people about battery pack
I think it’s time you upgraded the cameras, all other YouTubers I watch are at least 1440
If there a guy that can get this P1 fixed , it’s Tavarish, after seeing the him fix 675 LT , nothing it’s impossible for this man
2 of the nicest people of YouTube
In Jeremy Clarkson's voice: "Freddy you bloody idiot!"
Tavarish is the man!
i thought he blew the engine in the lt
"The first time we met was when this car is a mess" fast forward, it is now a mess again. You jynxed him haha
That signature was perfect.
I'm usually positive about what Freddie does but I think hes biting too big of a bullet on this list... I mean seriously
"I don't do anything stupid with it...."
Shmee knows everybody
I hope Freddy isn't going too mental taking this project on! I can't imagine how heartbroken he must have been when the LT engine blew just after picking up the P1 😢
Okay, this is officially the most famous P1 there is. Also the fact that everyone can just watch it get rebuilt. This will be the definition of sweat equity.
how can a fucking car battery cost that much? jeez
Hey Schmee it's guys.
My favorite McLaren P1 and 675lt
wait - so he fixed already blown engine on 675LT? Guess fixing video lags behind Shmme's visit, lol
The thing freddie did is just MADNESS,i hope he can rebuild it with the help of you,mat and other youtubers
Did you film this months ago before he blew up his 675LT? 😂 Did he ask you to wait until he's revealed it?
I love how the YouTube car scene interacts with each other. It’s like y’all are in one community. Both of you guys are in my top favorite shows
Man every one is getting a turn on this car. It truly is the neighborhood bicycle
Love this! 🎉
this whole video is like famous last words before the engine ate itself.
i can tell this was filmed a long while ago, the weeknd p1 and freddy's p1 is probably the most famous p1s
Tim you know how to keep a secret..
That signature nice as fuck got damn lol
I hope tavarish got the toilet it was sitting on
Ouch. Talking about daily driving the 675LT without a clue that connecting rods will soon ventilate the block with custom vents... Spooky.
Tavarish n shmee😍😍😍😍😍
Freddy is an absolute mad man for taking this on but in my heart of hearts I know he's going to smash it out of the park. I will def be watching the progress to follow its journey back to life. Well done Freddy on the purchase.
And the engine in it is dead. I wonder what Freddy is gonna do next
Nice to see the 675 before it went boom
"Whats that smell like?"   Shmee "hummmm yeaaa"  😂😂
Ohhh. This was b4 the 💥 💥 Boom🎉😮
Oof! Great video, Tim, but it was obviously filmed before Freddy's 675LT's motor grenaded itself. Looking at the bright side, MORE CONTENT FOR FREDDY!
LOL 315 miles! thats sad. But all I want to know is the story behind the toilet that ended on the windscreen.
Tavarish is one talented guy man 👏🏻
Oh yeah I got the smell on my phone yeah it smells fishy I can smell really good here in Virginia
That car went deep sea fishing is why it doesn't have a water line.
I respect how you and Matt basically imposed an embargo on yourselves until Tavarish posted his vid. Maximum kudos 👍
Hello
signatures on carbon engine cover should be by gold marker!
Tav - " i don't do anything stupid with it"  not so many miles later "My engine exploded!" 😅
I’m sure it will work out, but boy, that’s a bit of a risky venture. If he wasn’t able to get that car working would be a huge monetary loss
How does this man travel that fast,like a few days ago,he visited ChrisFix,now he’s at Tavarish.This man is insane.
So sad knowing what happens to the LT
There are so many Bits visiting Tavarish.
“Everything on the engine is fixed”   😆
TIM:  simply brilliant and wonderful collaboration with Tavarish.  Love the content, and the videos you produce with other YouTubers.  Please make more of them!
Seeing the LT is pretty funny. Truly nobody can predict the future,  not even the guy who built the car.
Since Freddy will NEVER be able to legally drive this car in the U.S. due to the title being a certificate of destruction, I wonder if Schmee can buy it off him and get it registered in the U.K.
Patiently waiting for the ChrisFix collab, it'll be just as epic as this
This is old a video because this car is broken too
I'm pumped to see this project completed.  Seeing what Freddy has taken on in the past, I have no doubt that it will be an amazing one of a kind work of art.  Thank you for the little sneak peek Shmee.
Mr Tavarish your engineering skills are amazing.  Thank you for challenging yourself and your teams.
I am so ready to watch all of what Freddie will do with the P1. He will make Automotive History. I am rooting him on every video.
Unfortunately, the first part on the 675LT has aged quite badly. Good luck with both builds!
EVERYONE!!! Head over to ‘Challenge the Road’ channel who owns one of the rarest McLaren P1’s!!! He got the designer Frank to sign it!!! So cool!!!
Now I was not expecting this, but certainly won't be missing out on watching.
What a mad lad Tavarish is for getting this car. It's going to be great!
RIP 675 LT
Freddy’s P1 was so new It still has the blinker fluid in it
This car is going to make so much content for so many people lol
It probably wont happen. But it would be epic if he fixed a LaFerrari and a 918 in the future. So he can say he has "the holy refurbished trinity"
You've got to admire the bravery to take this one on.. Exciting though.. Good luck to him 🏁
And you are a legend for supporting him!👊 Can't wait to see the progress!
physical body damage is one thing, but my question is-- being submerged in salt water, would that have possibly penetrated or permeated into the carbon fiber gelcoat and ruined the structural integrity of the whole body (specifically the monocoque)?
I wonder if he took the electronics apart and cleaned them with the dry ice if they would come back alive.
So Freddy blew up the engine after this video??..Or did he fix it before this shoot...sorry but i haven't followed??
Shmee never stops working, another video out already.
I guess this was before it blew up?
This is a brave man what an undertaking hats off to him looking forward to seeing his build. Great video Tim.
So this is an older video, since the blue one ... blew ....
That will be interesting to watch it get it rebuilt crazy man
This is why I love Freddy. I think his channel is going to get a real boost.
Very good energy between you 2 guys , loved it 😊
My guess is a 3 year build.
Tim, I wish you had bought a P1 instead of the Senna and Zenvo - it would have taken your channel to stratospheric levels!!!
He jinks himself smh
Is the LT after a engine rebuild. Or are the vids out of sequence?
Shot while ago obviously, Well before the 675's engine  grenaded.
It seemed like Tim was on the verge of tears forst looking at the interior before the smell almost adding to that
YouTube car channels buying cars from other YouTube car channels? Zzzz, zzz, zz.. Tavarish does not need these collaborations, he is standalone cool! I look forward to the rebuild without these distractions👍
I mean shmee you have a work shop, the question is will you ever attempt something like that??
This didn't age well
This is insanely cool. Kudos to Freddy!!
the tune up  for sure bend the rods
Also... I'm more interested in the truck behind ya guys! 😍
So this was filmed before the engine blew a rod through the block?
He needs to get rich rebuilds to inspect that battery to see if water made it's way into it.
Great content and perfect timing.
The cost of that is going to be eye-watering...
675LT is ok? I thought its engine blew
I would love Shmee to take his 675LT on a big adventure like this one in the GT Black Series. It is one of the OGs and it deserves to be driven!
I'm really torn here - we haven't seen "what happens next" from Freddy's first video, but now that you've put this up, we know (remove the rear, off for deep cleaning, etc).  That also said, it's nice to get a bit of a "preview" cause now I can't wait for next episode *that much more* yano?
He must be banking on YT revenues for this particular project because given the technology, parts, materials... it's a TRUE salvage job.
Turn some sand into a diamond 💎 or have it put into a fancy watch
the purple porshe loks to be rebuilt going well
It's truly something on how many content creators are posting videos about  this. Did he get himself in a huge mess by buying this, yes. Is he smart for buying this, of course. Huge business move that will pay back and then some by just people tuning into his videos through other's channels because they want to see how much he'll be in over his head. Smart business move on Freddy's part.
Cold revs the LT…blows up engine
I'm confused...I'm following both if you guys...at what point the engine blowout??
how many people said, Tavarish is buying that, the moment after settling seeing that video of the P1 floating away?
Smhee has a clone he’s everywhere!!!
What a brave man taking that project on.
Anyone want to place a guess on the finished colour of this build? Should Freddy keep it yellow?
Absolutley amazing and going into history with Tavarish included!
Funny to hear the 675LT start up knowing it now has a blown engine. Rest in peace, beautiful V8
Epic
Yolo
This must have been before he blew up the 675.. Can't wait until he starts on the P1!
mats gt3 in the back
he is the man for the job to do it, maybe with help from mat Armstrong. But it is a big big gamble. And he got 2 mclaren sort off😅😅
Strange that Freddy says ' I can't afford this car new ' But the restoration is always as expensive as the original car I always thought. And he has plenty of cars and real estate looking at the video...whatever, success with the project.
Fun fact: the previous owner of this P1 bought a speedtail a few weeks after this incident
The sadest part to me is that this thing was never driven before it got wrecked by mother froggin nature... Thats the real tragedy! Cant wait to see it sorted and be driven properly! Such a waste of resources, doubly so when people buy these things as pure "investments" and then never drive them... Yuck... I get not wanting to put 200k on them.. but f***!
He's the best person on YouTube to take on this project.
It was sad to see the hole in the block of the 675.
Freddie looks like he’s sitting ON the seats and less IN them
Damn it's gonna be super expensive
Good job
When was this filmed the lt has been broken for months.
Just another reason to drive your cars and enjoy them while you can. Can't wait to see this one unfold!
I really love tobacco  interiors, Nice 👍😌
This must have been filmed a while ago because the LT is now toast 😕
The car was broken right? Or is this after de fix? 😅
that sand is probably from some expensive private beach adds value to the p1 if anything
so the LT is fixed??
I hope Freddy paints to match the 675
So foreshadowing….the LT will leak oil. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Freddie is the absolute best. He was going to take a break and then found this project luckily for all of us.
This was recorded  long ago since Mclaren 675LT has a destroyed engine. But I wish him luck and patience in restoring both of them. Even though I think the 675LT will be easier and cheaper but not by much
Tim, do you ever sleep?  You are the busiest man on YouTube! You are absolutely everywhere.😂
Well this is an old video then.
about a year ago when he revealed his 675 he said my dream car is a mclaren f1 that i can never be able to afford after that is a p1 that he couldn’t afford (and he bought a flood damaged one) a year after he rebuilt the p1: hello guys my name is tavarish and i bought a crashed/flooded/fire damage mclaren f1🤣
A liiiittle painful seeing the LT in its running state knowing the engine self destructed 🥲 But I'm sure Tavarish will find a way to turn things around and make it even better than before!
So when you visited 675LT had intact engine block 😅
I was waiting for the traditional “Hi shmee I’m guys” April fools day intro LOLL
4lt P1
Where's Shmee's P1? 😖
Knowing what's coming with the LT 💀
Shmee will you ever attempt something like this?? It would be great for content and all of us would love it!!!!😊
EDIT: 1200 miles, eh? So this is before HardUp had a chance to sit inside the car Interesting timeline.
I thought Freddie’s 675LT engine blew up? Why are we seeing this from months ago?
flood damage p1 coming to a cartrek near you
Has the engine of the 675LT already been repaired or was the video taken before the capital engine damage?
Crikey!! Hope Freddy can resurrect this P1. Also hope he can get his 675LT fixed
I’m so confused on the timeline of this video, because he uploaded yesterday of him picking up the P1 also that 675 now has a blown engine 🤔
was this filmed before that 675LT engine blew up?
That 675LT is already fixed??
So crazy when Shmee posted about LaFerrari I spotted a LaFerrari when he post P1 I spotted today P1 😁crazy
One of the biggest projects done by any automotive youtuber, definitely not an easy one, good luck to Freddy
I would say that the purple colour of your Mclaren 675 would be a great colour combo for this P1
Awesome video
McLaren has an easy marketing opportunity here. They could use it as well, they make a lot of cool cars and I want them to survive.
This is going to be an amazing and exciting project. I’m super excited to see how this turns out. A quick question, will we be getting a video on that stunning pair of countachs we saw on insta? That would be awesome!
No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness.  Aristotle  Can be definitely said about Freddy.
One of the last rides in the pre-emplosion 675LT.
He has a video on his channel about this flood  damage  car the only and biggest plus is that carbon does not rust it will not be destroyed by corrosion
This video is so weird cos the timing is so wrong 🤣. The 675LT is currently grenaded yet you are driving in it, and the P1 video was just released but you're showing it in pieces on the floor when that hasn't even been revealed on Freddys channel 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So I thought the  LT blew up B4 Freddy bought the p1
I´m a bit confused now.  This must be an older video, cause Subscribers of Freddy`s channel know by now that the engine  of the 675LT blew up recently and shouldn´t be running at all.   Apart from that, i´m very much looking forward to see what he is going to do with the P1,  all the obstacles and costs that come with such a *massive* rebuild of this iconic car.
Gotta love Freddy
Does Shmee150 reply?
Most likely the least valued P1
He's on a whole new level of crazy... this will be awesome
Watched Tavarish’s vlog yesterday. I don’t envy what he’s got himself into but I do wish him the very best of luck.
Now he has 2 McLaren's yah, if anyone gonna do a crazy rebuild it's finna be Freddy
Hope he won’t start the project then mid way he starts complaining about it taking a toll on his mental health like he didn’t see it coming…. I don’t mean it in a bad way tho
98
Epic project!
Nice, you visited him again, can't wait for the p1 project. So pumped to see it
I can't wait to see this project finished
Biggest rebuild youtube will ever see, doesn't get any bigger than that
Of coarse you show up just as Freddy picks up his new project. As you say, “ it’s going to be epic” 🙏
Gonna be an epic video!
Shmee need a P1 in his collection.
This will be an amazing video series
Man what an honor to have you check out my hoopties!
Amazing timing! Good luck Freddy, you're mental 😂
1st
Tavarish needs a 765LT
Hi Shmee!
Ni hao 💥
First!
First
I can't decide if Tavarish is a genius or a madman, but either way this is going to be the biggest project ever! Sadly though, after our run out in his 675LT Spider, you might also be aware that engine has gone bang too... not ideal. Check out the P1 and more on ECR: https://exclusivecarregistry.com/details/mclaren/p1/1397
