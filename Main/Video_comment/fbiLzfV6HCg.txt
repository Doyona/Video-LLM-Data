Who did their line first?  👇👇👇👇👇👇
For the last 5 minutes I’ve been screaming Jerome craft the bones in an italian voice. So much that my dog started barking bc she thought I was someone else
Mitch's rant was great
Green hill, rooftop run & studiopolis? Editors has a good taste of music
DUDE IVE BEEN SCREAMING AT MY PHONE MAN JEROME HAS EVERYTHING
lol dont worry lachy im also scared of minecraft mobs hahah
What the viewers here  Mitch” tweiken” Then… Water or watermelon 😂😂😂😂😂
Rule 1 of minecraft: “Don’t dig straight down”  Mitch: 💀 Preston: 😃
Mitch is a psycho now😂
Jerome had the bones the whole time 😂
Mitch and Jerome the best duos
FIre the editor pls
We ignoring how Jerome had bones in his inventory the whole time?
im 21 years old and I just lost my shit, I literally ran a fan account for you guys when I was little and would draw. "the pack" fan art, I spent an entire thanksgiving morning drawing fan art that said "happy thanksgiving" with the pack characters surrounding it lol this is just weird and crazy to have opened YouTube and seen a channel called "the pack" uploading
So funny how Mitch and Jerome arguing on how to find bones when he has some
Can’t you not turn coal into black dye
I think Jerome does it on purpose
Nah the "Sunny" side of life was crazy
Thank you for the videos it really brightens my day
This channel is my childhood I love it so much
jerome having the bones from the beggining
I can’t believe Jerome had bones in his inventory for so long
Missed the Mitch and Jerome dynamic soo much, soo much nostalgia hearing Jerome brea at mitch 😂
The Pack Return Leaderboard  1 Point Per Win (in videos where there are definitive winners ofc) Vikk 2 Preston 1 Jerome 1 Rob 1 Lachlan 1 Mitch 0
Pack uhc duos
i was screaming at poofless to make green dye from their cacti
PLEASE MAKE A SERVER!!
Bajan never see for year everyone miss bajan Canadian
Who wants a new Crazy Craft series as the packs back!  👇
POWER MOVES ONLY
I'm loving Mitch's energy lol.
No complaints, but rhe editor uses sonic music a lot
Monster industries request day 5 I think. Gotta keep trying 😂
Dude loved these so much back in the day! So happy this vid is back
I loved all the subtle mentions of mitch kids channel sunny and melon 😂😂
Bro he had a bone in his inventory the whole time while he’s looking for bone meal it’s so annoying
The pack Monster industries when? day 2
Imagine dying to Bones: p
i love mitch!!!!!!!!!!
bring back the mitch face cam !!
Poofless, Merome, and Viklan 😭🔥
Missed the vik and lach duo
I’m internally screaming at my screen with Jerome missing the bones already in his inventory.
LETS GO POOFLESS
Which version of bingo is this?  On a server or is it a download?  Would love to play this!
Wish it was the whole bingo….
Sweeeet
Mitch and Jerome not doing the video and instead just building a house is a classic
I was on a nostalgia binge watching old videos of Jerome and Mitch and now I find out they’re back?!?! Oh we eating good. I’ve missed this.
missile wars is so old and would be EPIC
i like the pack when they have less energy
Bring pete back
Love u guys
Now we are adults watching this, man the nostalgia
The pack is back
Jerome might be the stupidest person ive ever met bro had the gold and the bones, and didnt know it
After awhile, maybe they can do an server again like How To Minecraft, but instead it’s How Do You Minecraft.
jerome had dones thw whole time
The number one rule in minecraft is always dig stright down
Where’s the new video at
Jerome really said sunny side as a hint bro
vikk carrying and lachnan doing fuckall
You guys should do a let’s play again. Just a survival world let’s play
Any video Jerome has something important that’s needed and he doesn’t realize hurts me so much but is so funny
Who is the best duo in the pack? I say Mitch and Jerome I've been watching them since I've heard of them
This is just pure serotonin 😊 I missed these guys so much. It's so good to have you guys back! ❤
What is preston's hair bruh
BATTLE SIEGE
You should play that one parkour game where lava is chasing you
I love how jerome just casually *well mitch look on the SUNNY side of things* lmao
They finally put the cams in the top left 🎉😂
i never would have thought that i’d be watching my favorite og minecraft youtubers again playing together. i’m 20 years old and it feels like i’m a kid again
We need a vlog video or just one of everybody reminiscing about old times.
Mitch needs a new Facecam. He's literally the only one without one.
Hey Mitch you ok? 7:52
One of the funniest videos I’ve seen
You guys need to do a monsters industry
we also need kenny, choco, pete
Bring back How to Minecraft with new updates!!!
Editing goes so hard like these guys have always been funny but the way its edited together makes it hilarious
American words are so cringe. “My guy”. Shut up
I am not hating but the editor is a good editor, sadly not a good story teller
Can we see a monsters industry episode
I’m dreaming for mitch to have a comeback
you guys should do the multi episode pixelmon battle on your main channels
We got hunger games, battle domes and bingo now all we need is a lucky block race to make it perfect
Can u guys play pixelmon again
The pack should join a minecraft championship as one team. That would be fun to watch
The fact they had to put vik and lachlan together was unfair
just seeing vik and lachlan lag is the best
Jerome threw so hard
Me at the end: JEROME YOU HAVE BONES IN YOUR INVENTORY
Money Wars
I just realized that Mitch uploads like 4 videos a day. Yo Mitch, if you're reading this I wanna say that dont get yourself tired. I know you want to make us happy but that doesnt mean you'll forget about your mental health. Stay healthy dood ❤
Please bring back monster industries 😭😭
Please bring back crazy craft🙏🏽🙏🏽
Pixelmon, Crazy craft, and how to Minecraft has to be something done soon
Can we get a pack monster industry pleaseeeee
Is this rainbow sheep and regular Minecraft
19:00 why didn't bro just dig straight down???
10:18 w music
Anyone know what map this is or where to download it? I've been looking for a 1.18+ version of Bingo that's not on Bedrock for a while now
Anyone know how I can play this?
glad to see the pack back together and making videos again. Would love to see you play a lava run map again, they were my favourite.
Idk about y’all but a UHC tournament would be amazing
5:07 Jerome telling mitch to look at the "Sunny" side of life... Hmm. ANYWAYS!
Can't decide on that thumbnail huh
That moment when Jerome goes to the portal and already has gold in his inventory
is cosmic coming back ????
Is there some way we can watch like an unedited or less edited version of one persons perspective? I'm a bit of a boomer and not into this fast paced multi-perspective Mr. Beast type stuff
Man that melon comeback could’ve been crazy if they had more leeway/time to get the gold XD
Would be insane of they did uhc
thank you so much for this nostalgia rush this is crazy to watch! i remember the old days were HOW TO MINECRAFT was a thing ahhhhh
Missile wars pls
More battle dome
please don’t stop with these classics, my childhood is finally back and it doesn’t feel rushed or forced
Lachlan playing on the high ping is harrrible
Uhc makes a comeback???????
Bro, using the Undertale theme song, This video is legendary
We NEED pixelmon
I need Pete in a video pls
Y’all remember when lachlans name was craftbattleduty
Crazy craft?
Bruh we need a new how to Minecraft cause these guys need to learn again
Bro jerome could've already won
Bajan Canadian falls in lava  Me: this is exactly why you should not dig straight down 😂
YALL SHOULD PLAY MONOPOLY
mitch sounds an awful like sunny from sunny and melon...
I really want to see monster industries again
play replica again!
Jerome had bones in his inventory no wayyy they lost that
WE NEED MONSTER INDUSTRIES BACK
What about TNT wars?
Bedwars, lucky blocks, skywars, hunger games…..
i’d love to see you guys play factions again
Not jerome having everything in his inventory
Correct me if I’m wrong, is @PeteZahHut part of the pack?
What happened to Lachlans face in the thumbnail??
Cops and robbers please again
I love how thete back together.  I'm 20 years old now and use to watch all these stuff over 10 years ago just before the pack was formed😁🥹
Can you guys revive MC Mondays?
Godlyy!!
Wow
Jerome having the gold and bones the whole time and not seeing it hurts me so much
Only true early people remember that the thumbnail was Lachlan at first and not Preston.
And it doesn't help when ur yt channel/mc account gets hacked. 🥲💔 Poor Mitch
Pixelmon, 100 Minecraft days, last day have a tournament
Monster industries please it was so good 🥺
nostolgia
yo wassup
I love all the subtle "sunny" references lol
I love Mitch bruh
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I’m pretty sure Ive se3n 3 different thumbnails 😆 kudos
need a better editor
So glad the boys are back
Jerome is killing me
Funny they changed the title and thumbnail. The old was was garbo.
Straight up when Lachlan said he had a lag spike the video lagged for me
Bring back some more of the homies for some battle dome and uhc. Also play legit survival games on a server
Would love to see you guys play risk factions again!
my childhood loves the pack videos
tbh jerome and mitch would of won if jerome noticed he had bones in his inventory 3 of them he just had to craft them to bonemeal then white dye and he would of won this was 3-4minutes before lachlan and vik won
Mitch Is essential to my life. Will definitely be invited to my wedding.
Yo bro imma be honest I need at least 3 videos a day because this content is 🤌🏼
I just I’m so in love w this channels miss all these guys together remembering what made me love the game so much so awesome pack keep going !!!!
Truly didn’t realize how much I missed this group
Like if Lachlan should bring back the og skin
mitch is SO funny
Why does mitch not show himself
after all these years jerome is still blind to his inventory
That was way too intense
i would love to see them in mcc
Why would the editor not put mitch dying in the lava before the reaction to it
W 48th on trending
Bajan scared his souls ahahahahaha! poor Jerome ahahahaha!!
Who else was screaming at the screen as jerome had bones and an ink sack for soooooo fucking long
hi
I hate when I need a new shaft 😔
We need another nostalgia craft!
Friday happiness
Ayo Who ever Edited This Big Up The Sonic Music at 3:00
love the dragonball theme when jerome shows up lol
damn mitch and jerome would have won if jerome had realized he had bones the whole time XD
Do monster industries
17:17 my man literally had  3 bones in his inventory (2nd row, 3rd column)
MMMMMMMMMMMMEEERRRROMEEEEE!!!!
PLEASE WHAT IS THE MUSIC PLAYING AT 3:00
Soooooo How To Minecraft when?
Legendary
Anyone else wish Mitch would post again :(
That’s why I don’t like vik he’s cocky
Hopefully we get to see pixelmon series from these it would be amazing
Loving the content, just wish the titles were less clickbait. I was going to overlook this video until the preview function showed me it was bingo. After that I was interested. Same for the last video too
Poofless vs. Viklan vs. Merome The original duo-ships This is the best video so far on this channel
This is exactly what I was worried about... I should've known it'd be too good to be true. I hope the extra revenue was worth just becoming another clickbait channel.
U guys r the best
death run would be so fun
They should a uhc like the good old times
Jerome woulda won on fish kills
Anyone know what map they used?
Waiting for the lucky block vid w the pack
H2M
Is there gonna be luckyblock challenges
I love this soooooo much
JEROMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Play other games too. It will bring in more views.
Maybe old pixelmon
Mitch: “Welcome to the dark side of YouTube Jerome 😈”  Rob: “apple or watermelon? 😊”
The pack in VR? Lachlan is too funny in it.
So we all just grown men watching our childhood heroes play Minecraft ?
we want how to minecraft season 7 vikk :)
Can you do a pack smp
Guys I honestly miss the pack so much and I’d wish y’all could bring back cosmic sky for you all and the community ❤
Play cops and robers or Risk🙏🏼
Anyone else in their 20’s and watching minecraft? 😭
i wont even care who wines they all my favorite og Minecraft YouTubers
Man I missed Bingo. For such a simple game it always feels so intense.
The fact Jerome and Mitch could’ve won minutes b4 anyone else smh
Does anyone know the name of this mod/plug-in?
God I missed Mitch man
I miss this Mitch. Thanks for making an appearance like this again Mitch 😁
does anyone have the file for the bingo map?
Mitch and jerome are the duo we need and don't deserve
Bring back UHC tournaments next! Could be a cool way for the pack to make some content with newer creators
People say ethoslab is "washed out", but tbh, the pack is truly washed out Sure, etho may not be in his prime, but at least he knows what he's doing Meanwhile, watching the pack be over-confident in a game they no longer know is painful I may have not been much of the fan of them back in their prime, but at least i respected them  Although, i was impressed with jerome for remembering about bonemeal dropping from fishes Although its a feature that's been around since 1.13.1 Aug 2018, not long after fish mobs were added in 1.13 Jul 2018, so not too impressive, but at least its more up to date than the rest of the pack  I think it would be good for them to do a vanilla 1.20 smp, just to catch themselves back to speed, and learn how the game works again, and it would be fun, as they can actually have character development, and adapt to the new world
X run
Not sure if this will get seen but you guys should do a monsters Industry one
Not Jerome having bone the entire time
2nd bottom is the most easiest
Bruh I’m really sitting here yelling you have the gold then the bones like a kid again and I’m all for it 😂
I think the timings are weird, it's a little confusing. Like, each teams perspective, so it skips back
I NEED ANOTHER
The pack should bring back monster industries
11:45 drowning in lava 🤣
You guys for your next vid should play Monster industries again that would bring back so many memories.
Omg so excited to see the old pack try new era Minecraft content like this or like Minecraft manhunt
I have they just completely forgotten you can get wheat from hay bales?
This is the best thing that’s happened
18:01 just heard what music is playing and it’s the halo theme
18:26 Jerome telling Mitch that Salmon dropped bonemeal when Jerome had 3 bones in his inventory and they could have won because Vic fell in the DT was the most painful moment of my life.
You guys should do a smp again like htm
wanted luckyblovkrace
Monsters industries pleaseee
Vik carrying lachlan to victory nothing has changed 😂💜
Bro Jerome took too Long💀
Anyone else screaming at their screen that Jerome has bones for the white dye and they probably would have won if he saw that? Awesome haha
I vividly remember being a hardcore little teenage girl shipping these three duos together like you wouldn’t believe 🤣 was halfway convinced Mitch and Jerome were secretly married lmao. That part of me grew up but the love of minecraft never did.
I love Mitch energy so good to see him back
Lachlan: IM SO DEEP, CMONNNN IM SOO DEEEP. Oh yea lachy you striking gold for sure 😂😂
i think you should throw it back and do a pixelmon
This is fun to watch
epic
Pixelmon island or box battle
Not gonna lie im surprised no one just make a nether portal with a bucket for the gold sword. Zombie piglin man
Mitch’s face wen?
Mitch has gone insane lol
Mitch and Jerome, I love them so much!!!
Should've called this episode the Gold Rush
They've returned! Merome, Vikklan and Poofless
Yo next video should be some classic uhc  Or Pixelmon
Jerome is something else with the gold and the grey dye, king
Bro, my phone straight up disrespectin me. I gave the video a like while watching the initial ad, before even wstching the video but after i finished the video and looked it had it as dislike instead of like. Aughta throw my phone in the trash for this heresy xD
Jerome having both of the final ingredients they needed to get a bingo and not realizing might be the best part of the vid
The fact that Jerome had the bones the whole time 😭
🩷🩷🩷🩷
Bro Jerome, the whole time you coulda won like so early you had bones and you got the sac 🤣
I remember Lachlan was always the underdog in mini games!!!!!! Super cool to see him and Vik win this time :D !!!!!
God bro I’ve missed mitch for so long😂😂 He’s bringing back the old minecraft energy
why doesn’t mitch have a facecam??
tell poor Lachy to get a vpn 😭
COPS AND ROBBERS PLEASE
The halo music makes these videos WAYYYY to nostalgic
Mortal Kombat!
I'm to old to be watching this but the fact I care that Jerome had bones the whole time and vik doesn't mine straight down knowing the other team is only one item away makes me furious
Watching rn at 2am reminds me of old times as a kid when I’d hide my phone under my bed at night then take it out late at night to watch these guys play
Day 1 of begging for a Pack team in MCC
Jerome had it for so long it hurt
petition to bring back find the button
could you guys please play monster industries again PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ 🙏🙏
Moreee
I hate when Preston says fudge like my man’s gotta be pushing 30 saying fudge… No hate but annoying
title's not good, should just say "bingo with the pack" or be more direct, there are just too many videos with the impossible ------ which just sounds clickbait (it actually is)
vik just dig straight down, u dont have to to the spiral stairs
This is why you should never break the number 1 rule of Minecraft: Never dig straight down.
Why did Jerome selllllllll
WOAAHAHHHHHHHH POOFLESS
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MINECRAFT BINGO
YAYYYYYYYY NEW PACK VID
Everytime I see that Elvis haircut I want to scream
i never watch youtube videos fully , but these bring back so much nostalgia , and it’s so entertaining i stay and to watch the whole thing
Not Jerome with the bones in his inventory while searching up if bone meal drops from salmon 19:41
Merome!!!  all day baby!! GG!!
I’m loving the Pack getting back together. And the Sonic music in the background
god i missed these videos so much don’t stop making these any time soon, would love a new SMP👀
F
We need a pixelmon tourney soon
Do lucky block next!!!!
The pack needs to play death swap!!!!!!!
Yall gotta be hinting at mitch sunny and melon all vid 😭
Common vikk W
W
Week 2 of asking the pack to bring back Monster Industries!
Dude Jerome not seeing that he already had bones had me screaming at my tv
This legitimately feels like how the videos used to be. Feels so nostalgic
For future videos that involve the chat as much as this one could you all set your chat box sizes to the same size? It's kind of jarring seeing them go from small to big and big to small as the video swaps perspectives
Jerome had bones in his inventory the whole time bruh
i want monster industries to return!?!
I missed pixelmon and also the crazy craft series that the pack did back then
NEW VIDEO POG
doesn’t mitch have a new YT called sunny and melon?
Merome 4 Life
forgot how much fun i used to have watching Jerome and Mitch just mess about. good to have the whole pack back together!
Mine
Can Mitch get a face cam?
12:23 classic
I wish Mitch had a face cam
It’s sick how Mitch has a channel with his brother sunny and melon  for more kids friendly type of content but it ain’t cool he kinda abandoned his main channel
wtf is this ending? not seeing vik actually finding the gold - sus  and it just ends so abruptly like did yellow even win???
they  needa do another pixelmon series 😢
"Hold on, /time set night - that didnt work" lmao
yoooooo @tbnrfrags who let you get your haircut like that boi???????? that ish whack as all get out LMAO
So good to see Mitch excited
I love Mitch energy
Yash more pack
I think we should have how to minecraft come back
Me screaming at Jerome bc he had bones in his inventory the entireee timeee
I think its time to collect signatures for h7m to finally happen bois
Dang crazy they are back now, I had watched them since elementary school, and now I’m gonna be senior
Merome!!!###
Smosh is back now The pack is back as well!
Loved watching these dudes back when I was a teenager.  If Nooch and xRpMx also come back then peak youtube will return haha
I still feel like bedwars should be played
Very Awesome
I want Mitch to have a face cam!
tfw Jerome found bones in that Dungeon and forgot about them
Do battle dome
Despite not having any luck on par with the other teams, Merome still would have won if Jerome only realised that he had bones the whole time.... 17:17 (and he finds the ink sack at 19:27)
Jerome sold so hard…
I love Mitch's energy after all these years still. Love the intensity and how the editors represent it too lol
Can you guys bring back missle wars that was one of my fav vids
Jerome threw so hard
I mis Bajin Canadian
Music made it feel so Chaotic.
tnt wars when
Not Jerome beging able to finish the bingo so long ago
Not Jerome having all the materials for sooo long 😂 Merome did not disappoint
Please just do normal titles lol
I absolutely love Mitch and missed this side of him
day 3 of asking for monster industries 😢
Bro this video had me STRESSED
Can the pack do lucky block hunger games next or something related pvp related  :D I love the videos tho
I love these bruh!
Omg the pack were the first members I ever subscribed to on YouTube starting with preston, then vik, then everyone else. I’m so happy to see this!❤❤ and I’m in my 20’s now 😂😂
Trowstar123
pixelmon gotta start a series
Video 2 of asking for capture the wool to come back
Mitch’s mental breakdown was hilarious and I’m all here for it in the future.
Please do a ark survival evaluation video
I WANNA WIN AGAIN
Pack being back is nice man. W summer
Imagine having the win the whole time and still not winning 🤦🏿‍♂️ lol GG tho Jerome! Next time check your inventory (especially for gold and bones) 😂
Jerome threw so hard with the fish
This is the perfect balance of old minecraft videos and old bits with new personalities of old players. The chemistry and humor of everyone is just as good, if not better than the old Pack days
can we get an  PIXELMON SMP ?
Play monster industries
The old MC feel....the feelings we have missed for years. It is back, THE PACK IS BACK
Jerome solddd bruhh
Bring back monster industries!
YOOOO ANOTHER VID
preston's voice sounds so much deeper than his old videos now lol
Jerome having the items in his inventory to win and completely missing it is how I know the pack is back for real
Jerome is such a wholesome chap
I love Jerome but he had bones for so long i was screaming to myself 😭
F
Hey so… now we need some diversity 😈 Mitch & Jerome we need your hunger games… Preston and Rob we need your factions…. Lachlan and Vikk…. Y’all need a pixelmon survival plzzzz dudes do it for the vine
Jerome forgot how to think after the dungeon
Jerome had bones the whole time
here's a take, make the vids and group less family friendly since the majority of the viewers have grown up so it'd be refreshing to see new sides to the pack thats for mature audiences.
The mortal Kombat music
Loving this channel, decade long fan :)
wheres the SUMOTORIIIIIIIII
The best video out of the three they've posted
vik with the 2023 lachlan carry <3 some things never change
these videos are hilarious
Need to see some bed wars
I enjoy how not intense 2023 youtube these videos are.
5:05 Jerome was too quick with that "Sunny" side of life quip lmao
ooooo ahhhh ahhhh oooooo ahhhhh munkeee
Lets goo!
Prisons again????????
This is a good video but maybe say your playing bingo in the title/thumbnail instead of making it look like a reaction video
Once again. Preston and Rob pls bring back Cosmicpvp
Y’all should make a Pack SMP
The pack vs the sidemen would be such a good video, very hectic and insane but so funny 😂
They got to do lucky blocks
4:57 Mitch says he hasn’t recorded a video in a year but isn’t he apart of Sunny & Melon??? I’m so confused.
Brooo This was  intense honestly thought Jerome and mitch wouldve won since jerome got the squid and there was salmon where he got the squid as well....but i mean... what can we do lmao  btw nice edit of the Mcombat theme with mitch Lol
We all know Jerome was holding back 💯
You guys should also do Battle Dome was always a great video in the past
2nd video asking for capture the wool
Can I just say how happy this makes me. My childhood is being restored one video at a time 🥲
Team Lucky block race into a fight would be a hit…
So much adhd, too much editing
Ngl I would say cops and robbers
a merome classic, having exactly what they need in their inventory but just not seeing it lol
MONSTERS INDUSTRIES NEXT PLEEASSEE
Why’s Alex pusabi playing with vik
This video is enough nostalgia to make a grown man cry
I mean I'm still in shock that the pack is back but now we get a video with Viklan, Poofless and Merome!!!
Bajan canadians humour is outdated
I’m loving all the hints to Sunny and Melon lol they tryna expose Mitch
should do monster industries again
Jerome threw this game so much. Merome should’ve won
Episode 3 of asking for a pokemon island series
A Lock Out Bingo would go so hard
Summary of the video:  Vikk and Lachlan- great start but almost bottled it on the last one   Rob and Preston- the calmest duo but way too slow  Mitch and Jerome- chaos chaos and more chaos yet still managed to almost win had Jerome just checked his inventory😂😂😂
Jerome literally not noticing he could win for so long is classic
I want Mitch to come Back to MC videos, honestly if he made content he loved on it I think a huge chunk of his viewers literally will come back because he went missing.
Miss Mitch 😭
Missed woofless and the rest for the pack buzzing the boys are back
Mitch & Jerome not much skill just vibes
Mitch really was a ray of sunshine this video ☀️
You can make leather horse armor
vikk just carrying lachy
Ive missed Mitch so much, was always one of my favorites. Thank you guys for these 🥲
This is one of the most clever stories I've ever seen 😂
I love seeing Merome together again. Mitch's chaotic energy has been much missed.
Jerome threw the game he had bones the whole time
honestly i watch thepack cause of pure nostalgia
Damn... I'm so happy Vikk won! 😅😅😅 I so badly wanted him nd Lachlan to win! 😅
Love that everyone makes time for these videos.❤
12:22 And that my friends is why you don’t dig straight down
21:10 bro
Love that it’s back and just like before
The best pack duo won let’s go
18:10 tf classic vik gotta do with anything. other team also went that route and you guys are making repeaters smh
Lmao Jerome is probably missing stream chat helping him
14:43 bro you got gold from spawner
please bring back minecraft factions or crazy craft or try doing an ark survival lets play
12:16 lmao number 1 rule of mc
The LEGENDS ARE BACK
Have Mitch get a camera !
Jerome not realizing he has bones in his inventory and gold
I love how the pack grew up with there audience, I love the vibe and mood, I wasn’t sure if they would just be like the pack we knew best, but their even better than that! Love the content guys keep it up! 👍
Jerome sold the entire W
w
Poofless, Vikklan, Merome 😢
You gotta bring back monstere industries cmon man!!
Ok bingo is valid. Thought they turned to a react channel when  I saw the title
Comfort content! Thank you for reviving my childhood, for however long this lasts. Thank you for doing this!
19:40 Jerome not realizing he had bone meal and the ink sac to make gray dye was the most unfortunate thing.
WHERE IS THE FACE CAM FROM MITCH?!
JEROME HAD BONES IN HIS INVENTORY THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT BONES REEEEEE
W video
Jerome looking for bone meal whilst having bones in his inventory is such a Jerome thing.
I'm so happy
Monster Industries would be sick!!!
what age is the content you are producing for? im pretty sure, im not in it
Why is Jerome just cooking meat, he has bones for white dye just go get a squid lmao 😂😭
What’s the name of the song in the background at 7:02? Ik it’s an anime something
Mitch has a chaotic good energy I love it
preston's jokes now that he's back with the guys are so funny you can tell he's been missing them playing mc
THATS MY GOAT WINNING HES MY GOATTTTTTTTTTTTTT
this is the best video yet
yall being back together is really helping my depression 😭 taking me back to the good days!
Please explain what the video is about in either the thumbnail or title it'd probably increase viewa
Is it impossible for Preston to swear
Write Minecraft bingo in the title
Mitch talking ab not filming a video in a year as if he doesn’t post everyday on his roblox account 😭
Poofles x Merome x Vikklan = Banger vid
The Pack is Back, and I couldn’t be happier as a I’ve been waiting many years for something like this.  Also late but still congratulations to Mitch getting married! You’ve deserved it.
Watching my childhood heroes not know a single thing about this game hurts my head lmao
Does Jerome realize that he had bones he could have made it white dye he could have won the whole game
Bro Jerome had bone meal in his inventory and completely ignored it. Bruh
y o
You guys should do a modern run from the beast. I’d be happy to provide a new map with new mechanics. Of course the main theme of run from the beast will be maintained
Omg i miss them soo much i was accutacly watching old minecraft factions with lachlan and vikk when i came across the new upload
BINGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YALL DID IT
You should 100% do super lava run again
Play money wars next!!
It hurts to see my childhood Minecraft veterans know nothing about Minecraft
Vikklan vs Poofless vs Merome GOATED
We just gonna ignore the fact jerry had bones on him and couldve won like 2 minutes before vikk?😂
pixlemon would go crazy
I don’t understand why you’re making kids content, you’re allowed to age up your content.
I had no idea it was Friday
You can craft leather horse armor
Love the packs vids glad they’re back.
not jerome having bones in his inventory the whole time
i hate what lachlan does now he bases everything with fortnite and became way more cringe
Jerome had bones in his inventory when he killed the squid
5:08 what a reference💀
You should go back to mcc championship with team vs team plus you can add like Pete zahhutt and one more to make a 8 player 2 team thing
w
So happy to see mitch back
12:05 pro minecraft maneuver from lachlan
Jerome could’ve ended the game for 10 minutes if he just looked in his inventory 😢
vikk and lachlan throwing
Man Mitch needs to make a new channel and start over lol we miss him !
y’all should play capture the wool
Bro Jerome had bones in his invintory the whole time lol
mitch and jerome in this are giving me dennis and charlie from IASIP vibes
Vikk not breaking the block above the chest in the ocean was painful.
Can't even describe the happiness of y'all being back together. Brings back so many memories and I can't stop smiling 😍😭
Jerome threw so hard, he had bones for most of the video😂
Who else was yelling at Jerome cause he had bones the entire time
this channel is now my weekly seratonin booster 😃
Bro they got 140k in three videos
I still love the irony of Jerome telling Mitch to "Look on the sunny side of things".
The gold sitting in Jerome’s inventory when needing a good sword…and he was in a ocean with 50 fish he could’ve killed to get a bone for the dye couple won forever ago😭
I like how Jerome missed the bones in his inventory
So glad they are back We need a lucky block video!!!
The editer clearly loves sonic 😂
The legends are back!
I was SCREAMING at Jerome bro he sold the win in the most embarrassing way possible
now that the packs back I'm now waiting for the return of team crafted
19:41 Jerome can win right there
Too many sunny references, IYKYK🌞
This is so made for kids. The OG guys don’t like this cutting and editing it’s to wannabe dream and those guys, the pack needs to stick to the old ways.
I miss this
Oh my God I love the come back so much. I love the pack!! You guys have to do a throwback vid to monster industries next ❤
the end was reallly intense lol😂😂😂 love the videos keep it coming thank you!!
Bruh Jerome had bones
Jerome gotta bone and ink sack in his inventory and took him that long to make dye 😭
Jerome had the bones for so long😭
I'm like Vik threw the game 😂GG
Jerome and Bajan are class sometimes
Longshot but I hope pokemon island comes back
I guess the "Imagine Dying to Bones" meme might have finally died. I thought Jerome would have said that to Preston
i love bingo! i wanted merome to win though ghghgg
When the monster industries???
Do pixelmon mini games!!! Pleaseeee 😫
POOFLESS WILL COME BACK MORE POWERFUL
I’m so glad y’all are playing Minecraft again 😊 Wish you would do more often. Maybe 3 times a week???¿¿???
Love the video but please change the editing the timing is all off and the music deosn’t sync with the vibes. I shouldn’t even be complaining happy the pack is back but cant help but ask
Jerome could have won if he just realized he had bones
Put Bingo in the title, sounds way more interesting. Good vid tho
Merome. Betty. Frederick .
Man mitch and Jerome due was my childhood 😢 ❤
We need pixlemon next week
NAAHHH THE HUNGER GAMES MV AT 9 MINUTES
We love Mitch!
man i love seeing this content again, so entertaining
Can we get a pixelmon island so craft batttle duty can shine
WE WANT THE PACK + PETE AGAIN PLEASEEEEEEEE
U guys gotta do the Cops and Robbers!
Jerome did not feed the gerbils before the video.
That is quite possibly the worst game ive ever seen 💀
I love how jerome could have won the game at 19:41 but completely choked the game
Jeromes sunny and melon reference/joke omg lol
I love that these guys are so clueless sometimes like preston not trying to find a desert temple😂
Please do a lava run video
Fucking nostalgia 😫  I went back and started watching thr old hungergames with Jerome and Mitch ❤❤
3v3 Monsters Inc. Also congrats Mitch. Have a wonderful Honeymoon.
jerome not realizing he had gold ingots LMAO
Love me some bingo
SidemenGaming
Just make this minecraft bingo
yo editor for  things like when mitch died in lava, you showed prestons reaction first, and then viks, and THEN you showed him falling in lava. Would be much much better if you showed mitch dying first. Same for when someone completed an objective. We want to see their pov of completing it first instead of seeing the achievement on someone else's recording before we see their pov  edit: but I'm no expert so you do you editor
Mitch broke the rules of Minecraft and died because of it
I couldn’t stop laughing when Mitch fell into that lava, hilarious 🤣
Surely they don’t care about subs on this channel right
Jerome just having bones
anyone else notice that jerome had the bones
Mitch brings the energy!
hi
I'd love to see some lucky block islands
bring back monster industries
Jerome having stuff whole time and not realising is golden
These videos are nostalgia
i loveeee thissssss
WHY NOT AHAHAHA (after several unsuccessful tries ti find the mouse and/or controller…) also had my colonoscopy this morning… W!!!!!!!!
Mitch needs a facecam
I almost didn't watch this video cuz I thought it was a Reaction video. If the title had "Minecraft BINGO" in it I would've clicked instantly
The pack is back and so is the merome fan fics im sure
Anyone else realize when Jerome was talking about the fish he had bones in his inventory
The frustration Jerome gave me😂😂😂😂
❤😍🔥
lachlan was so fun to watch and now so hard to watch 😂
I seriously love these guys. I don’t really even watch for the Minecraft I just feel like I’m hangin out with them like their old videos. Just vibes no matter what they’re doing
Monsters Industries please!
I almost didn’t click this vid because of the title. Just make the title the pack play bingo. We would all watch the pack play bingo
loving these minigames, pls bring back monster industries, replica and lava run!!!!!!!!
LUK
So glad the pack is back
8:00 Mitch be wildin 😂 love you Mitch
Happy to see all again
I’m loving these pack videos. Maybe one day you guys could bring back Missile wars if that’s possible 🤞
How To Minecraft?
PLEASE play risk with the pack they used to be my favourite videos
5:08 Cry me a river. Get a 9 to 5 job if your life is that miserable. Wonder what you would say then.
Jerome is the bindest person I know lol
algo
The fact that Jerome had bones looking for bone mean got me
sidemen sundays, the pack fridays, weekly schedule on yt stepping up now
I love that you have a good time together
MORE I WANT MORE.
Jerome had bones that entire time
We need Monster industry pls :)
When u guys gonna do monster industry’s
not a fan of how much luck came into the challenge like holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
14:44 Jerome had the bones the entire time
5:07 heh "sunny"
pls do monster industries again
🤣🤣🤣The fact that Jerome had Bones and an Ink Sac in his inventory is halarious 19:41
Yall gotta change the editor fr. He's spoiling the funny moments (mitch dying in lava)
Mitch tho😂
I look forward to these every Friday
stop trying to get viral titles. The fans just want "The Pack Minecraft Bingo!"
Mitch being gone for so long that he forgot the number one rule of minecraft NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN
Please do some lucky blocks!!
lachlan is still lachlan i guess still lost in minecraft
If y’all are tryna appeal to guys like me that watched you as a kid I’d like to see things a bit more raw from y’all. Watching it feels like y’all ham up the energy for the vid but I just like y’all’s personalities and chemistry in its natural state. If you’re tryna appeal to the new MC kids I totally get the hype energetic popular type content. But just as a old viewer that’s how I feel. This is meant to be constructive pls don’t take offense! Love to see the pack again.
Can we get a monster industries video
We're probably mostly adults in our late teens and early 20s watching these 30-year-old men play minecraft. It wouldn't make sense to most people, but for all of us, this is really something special.
How to minecraft…?
So peak agh so peak even the unedited out greenscreens
It feels like Mitch and Jerome have switched energies
Did he say to look on the “sunny” side of life? Hmmmm
So happy that they're doing OG mini games
I keep this on the background to help the pack grow! Please keep making videos
Commenting for the algorithm
Preston and Jerome’s green screens weren’t on😅
MONSTER INDUSTRIES!!!
Stardust Speedway is a total bop for background music!🎶🌟🎶 So is all the others! Especially at the end for Hopes and Dreams.. GOOD JOB EDITOR!
Jerome threw thw win in classic Jerome fashion, you love to see it 💀
You guys gonna do a money war or good ol wool wars on the classic map
Jerome sold lmaoooo
The copyright for that Mortal Kombat song might come back to bite them in the ass 😂
Bro the fact that jerome could have gotten grey dye sinc he had bone
pixelmon please xx
bingo makes me feel so nostalgic i hope there can be more bingo videos maybe even with guests 😃
Is nobody going to talk about how Jerome literally had the materials to make the grey dye minutes before vik made the gold sword 💀
love seeing this again!!! you guys being back just enjoying each others company while playin a game i hope you all are enjoying its awesome love seeing stuff like this the nostalgia flow is insane!
To think most of us were in middle school then…..now look at us
They need to do a monsters industries video, those were the bomb back in the day!  Omg and tnt wars! That is a must for their next video!!
Loving these videos! Wish they were longer!
jerime was looking for gold when he had gold, and looking for skeletons when he had bones lol
What mitch thinks about YouTube in 2023 is exactly what I think lol. FAKE THAT ENERGY WOOOOOO HYPPPPPPE....
Vikkkkkstaaaaaar123 👑👑👑👑👑
❤
Jerome threw so hard. He could have made the grey dye way before vik did anything
Jerome with the biggest throw of the new channel
jerome coulda won for ao long but didnt use his bones
Money/Egg wars should be next!!!❤❤
Not Jerome swimming away from fish
Nah, this was amazing!
minecraft death run next? ❤
Me patiently waiting for hunger games or pixelmon to come back like seriously pack I love you :))
I missed you guys!!! I watched you all like 8 years ago thanks for coming back!!!
🥰
19:40 Jerome has bones and the ink sack already lol
Bru this reminds me of vik in mcc
Omg the nostalgia, Minecraft bingo was always one of my favourite series, love this from you guys ❤
BRING BACK MONSTER INDUSTRIES!!
jerome having the bones to make the dye was so rage inducing
When you realize that Jerome had bones in his inventory the entire time and could have just won
I like for how half of them its relearning how to play Minecraft again 😂
I was literally screaming at my screen when Jerome got the dye he literally already had the bones they could have won so much faster
Dude the fact that Jerome had the items he needed to win in his inventory for half the end was driving me insane bro
I can’t lie, for some reason the cut to the clip of the hunger games music video made me so happy.
Mitch is just such vibes 😂😂
Someone tell these boys to turn up their render distance
love mitch
We not gonna talk about how Jerome had bones and ink sacs and didn’t make grey dye
bring back pixelmon island, h2m, and crazycraft
Mitch Start uploading again pleaseee
it annoyed me so much how jerome had bones in his inventory with the ink sac for so long
The bald guy is the only one who doesn’t bring the same vibes as everyone else
Its been so long since they were all together, i miss htm (how to minecraft)
I just want to say that Jerome is so stupid he has the bone in his inventory the whole time 😤😑
love that the boys are back 🤞
Thank you to all the pack members that even to this day you guys make me happy
I’m so happy for the views you guys are getting
You know its been a long time when they forget how to play minecraft. Woofles has bones to make bonemeal.
This game was sooo close, the suspense was real
Imagine if they threw in some crazy craft
Bb
I loveeeeed the bingo's way back when. And we got the 3 ships, yaaaay
Vikk and Lachlan trying their hardest to throw, Jerome having first the gold then the bones in his inventory and not realising - this was so funny to watch
noice
Would love to see capture the wool
BRING BACK MONSTER INDUSTRIES PLEASE!!
Vikk forgot his password I guess
I'm just reliving my memories of the og pack era❤❤ Keep up the good work lads❤
Bro Jerome sitting with a bone in his inventory trying to get bonemeal had me crying
Only for vikkk
y’all should do series! make the best of this channel like y’all did back in the days with your individual channels
Pleaseeeee pixelmon
Rooftop run playing in the background at 3:10🤧🤧
I can’t wait till they eventually play some lucky block themed games
BRING BACK LUCKY BLOCK STAIRCASE PLEASE!!
need to see the walls again
Ngl some Pixelmon Island would bring back memories
battledome plz ?????????///?
we want lucky block race and the dropper!
HE HAD THE BONES
Old factions
MITCH IS FUNNY!!!
Jerome rly had bones in his inventory the whole time 😭
Pretty sure the oof sound is copyright
lucky block games soon? classic 64 blocks rules
jerome could have won he had bones the whole time!!!!!!!!
The Pack never dissapoints!
Day 2 of asking for How to Minecraft Season 7
Please bring back monster industries 🙏
I actually forgot how elite of a mini game bingo used to be. The nostalgia is hitting hard
The fact that Jerome had the bones and didn’t know is such a classic Jerome move. 💀💀💀
i really want the benja face cam lmao
Should play pixlemon
Bring back memories
I would've clicked faster if I knew it was Minecraft Bingo lowkey
Jerome had bones forever 😭😭
Lachlan should wear his OG red Minecraft skin or the pixelmon trainer one instead of freaking fortniye 😢
Where’s BajanCanadian’s webcam!?
Monster Industries!!!
Jerome bro had bones, gold, and an ink sac
More Lachlan!!!!
19:40 JEROME HAD BONES?!?!?😂
why is mitch the only one without face cam
“And keep filming and talking”😭😭😭😂 yo Mitch was going through it
5:07 Jerome drops Easter egg about Mitch uploading
I liked this video only because #1 no one was cheating...im glad their back but when some of their videos are just them cheating to win, or messing up the game, I really dont want to watch that stuff. Play the games how they are meant, be yourself, and you get views.
You guys should restart the HTM series, loved that
Jerome finally realising he has gold and didnt realise he had bones pretty much the whole time 🤣 such a jerome thing to do
Pack Friday let’s gooo
VIKLAN LETS GOOOOOO
BATTLE DOME BATTLE DOME PLZ
First hour
Still waiting for Jerome to say “Diamonds Mitch”
Congrats on the wedding Mitch!!!
You should play lucky block race.
Bring back the HTM Bois like kenny, NOOCH, Pete, CHOCO
Bro Jerome not noticing he had bones the full time was TRIGGERING ME
Wait, I just realized……Mitch has the username BajanCanadian.  I thought he lost that account and couldn’t get it back.  Did he get that back somehow after he stopped making solo videos, or am I just forgetting that he got it back a while ago or something?
Pixelmon
Jerome, oh Jerome, you could've won the thing..........
LMAO Jerome said the sunny side of life hinting that Mitch is sunny since not many people know about that channel haha
The Pack videos at peak entertainment
Monsters industries anyone?
"That's not the only line we're doing" Mans on coke
Iv been rewatching your guys pixelmon island smp!!!
this brings back so many childhood memories you guys are elite
236th comment 🤯
I really like the bgm with it being from a lot of classic video games
Do uhccc
MOSTER INDUSTRIES MUST BE NEXT. DAY 3 ASKING
Im so happy they’re back
I want to see Petezahutt in here please
Blaaaddeeee
When Jerome could've easily won as he had a bone and ink sac, bone melting situation
❤❤
You guys gotta play Michael Meyers!!!!!!
I would much rather have the video title as “Minecraft bingo with the pack”
Funny how Jerome had bones in his inventory the whole time and didnt notice.
we love fridays
My childhood FeelsStrongMan
BRING BACK TNT WARS LUCKY BLOCKS PARKOUR VIDEOS AND FACTIONS
Missile wars was goated
Do skywars, bedwars, UHC, money wars or Lucky block battles
jerome with the ultimate throw
Do monster industries
The fact that Jerome had bones and an ink sack was killing me!😂😂
If you know you know. “Sometimes you have to look at the *SUNNY* side of life” -Jerome
We NEED to see some lucky block staircases, that shit went crazy
I’m still just waiting for Mitchy Moos face cam. I miss his face
Bajan says he hasn’t filmed in a year but posts daily on Sunny and Melon
Please Jerome, please actually take the time to check your inventory 😭
that was such an intense and insane bout at the end
HOLY FK SUCH A GOOD VIDEO DUDE
Pixelmon would go hard
21:05 🤣 LACHLANN NOO
The fact Jerome had bone meal and could have made grey dye and won lmao
Yesssss vikkstar wit the dubsss 🥳 better then “woofles, preston, mitch,lachlan cool
Jerome had bones the entire time😭
Jerome having items to craft the grey dye makes it so much better to watch because they didn’t realize
Soo... Who's going to tell them that leather horse armour is craftable
O
lachlan and vik is a goated duo
Could we get cosmic server videos?
Og
Mitch where yo face
Mitch having a tough day huh
Anyone else see that Jerome had bones in his inventory that whole time for the grey dye?
The fact that Jerome had bones when he got the squid was stressing me out
I AM SCREAMING JEROME YOU HAVE BONES
Jerome having bones in his inventory the whole time😂😂😂
Gerome had bone and ink in his inv LMAO 19:41
Vikkstar dying in the temple is too good 😂😂
Love how high quality everyones cameras are, especially Mitch's
We need them to all take on the warden or something, I’d love to see Lachlan’s reaction
Did anyone else see the bones in Jerome's inventory when he opened it after he got the ink sac
This was so fun !! The way everyone had gold at the end and died took me 💀
It’s crazy how Jerome might be the one with the most modern Minecraft knowledge now!
YESSSS MORE PACK CIDEOS LETS FUCKING GOOOO

POOFLES, MEROME AND VIKKLAN ARE BACK !!
This is the better version of smosh getting back together
Mitch was missed these years
Not me wondering what a speed run with them would work.
Jerome had bones almost the entire game and he could have made the dye and won but he forgot 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Need Mitch to start uploading again. The memories from his banter is crazy 😂
I legit grew up watching you guys I’m so glad you guys are back and obviously it’s the exact same but it still feels good I love you guys so much
bring some other youtubers on in some of y'all's videos, the more the merrier. Like imagine if in the battledome video you had a 5v5 or if you guys had like 15 people playing hunger games, ya feel?
mitch's energy been unmatched recently
POOFLES IS FINALLY BACK!!!!!🤩
Loving this channel so far! Keep it up!
Poofless is great.
Mitch has such a Sunny disposition
Crazy craft👀👀
Jerome had materials to craft Gray Dye the whole time!
13:42 “He could give us Melon trades. He could also give us Sunny trades” talking about Sunny and Melon!!!
They’re back finally ❤❤❤
Mitch’s energy has been missed for years, so glad he’s back (also shoutout to Jerome for the countless pictures, from his hometown)
Jerome had the bones and inc sac in his inventory so long before vikk and lachlan even got the bingo
Cool
Jerome threw so hard
Loving these videos! Mitch webcam when?
Mitch: *I can play minecraft with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind my back*  Rob: Apples or Watermelon
Jerome having the gold and the bones the whole time makes this so much better xD
wow hitting all the old mini games. this is kinda surreal lol
monster indestres
8:12 the pure intensity of Mitch and Jerome cutting to the calmness of Rob asking Preston “apples or watermelon” was amazing. Shoutout editor ☝🏾
Mitch is the goat
