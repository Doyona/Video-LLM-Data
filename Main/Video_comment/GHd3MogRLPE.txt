Cowboys were so stacked this year, it’s amazing how cursed this franchise is.
looking back to this game, cowboys fans still can NOT talk about the edmonds "fumble", on Dallas' first TD drive, arizona got an Interception, but it was called back for PI, however, it was a very bad call, Contact was well timed and it was good coverage, they can't say "Dallas vs Refs" when the refs basically gave dallas a TD
Crazy that this is the most recent regular season home loss for the Cowboys
Fun fact this is actually the game before John maddens deaf
Oh, my God.  How do you cornerblock the little giant?
Lol.  That was the hardest touch down for the 🤠 Cowboy's.
No way.
The little giant couldn't catch the ball.
Dak is a little guy compared to these little giants.
This Cardinals defense is tough.
Lol. Who is that Quarterback on the Cardinals? He a long arm.
The fumble should have been reviewed and we would have won the game. Cant wait to blow this team out
The cardinals look like  shorter players.

As a Washington fan after the thrashing the cowboys gave my team the week before the Cardinals became my heroes for this. 😁👍👍
Last time the cards had an impressive win
So many bad plays from Dak omg
that was a fumble still 7 months later
11:08 Best defensive play of the year in my opinion.
Cowboys could have easily won the game. Bro on the helmet catch, it could have easily been knocked down or intercepted if the defender didn’t raise his hands in the air and let the receiver have a chance
That was a fumble. Dallas woulda had 2 minutes to go score. So wrong.
still cant believe westley landed with that .. and he still on the team
Cardinals gets in and a crazy catch has a chance
This was essentially a preview for the wildcard round😭
Edmans broke ankles 🏈
FUMBLE!
8 min left in the 2nd qt and it's already shown 2 PI and A hold extend 3rd and 4th down...if we can play a clean game, we win ...that simple
We lost that to ourselves ...a field goal made and the needless fumble from dak...result of a TERRIBLE block from zeke...we win
1:17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrHs-CML4KM 👈  I knew every single fact from this video,how about you ??
3:23
That PI at 5:35 was nonsense. That was great coverage
One of those teams that are "Only Good At Regular Season"
Let’s go cards🔴⚪️🔴⚪️  cry abt it cowgirls
Randy Gregory played terribly in this game.
Cowboys number one offense in league ! That's a laugh!! Go Cards!!
FG Good 1:18
Kyler Murray wants traded
Who else is sick and god dam tierd of these Gronk commercials?
red sea salt
i say this w a heavy heart 2 cowboy fans.. BANG BANG NINER GANG
cowboys couldn’t win this game but all the fans thinking there the best in the NFL, damn you all just stupid.
49ers are gonna be running all day, ALL DAY
No Talk About Referees Making Bad Calls Against The Cowboys? But Clearly Ignored A Push Off From The Cardinals Reciever , Not To Mention The Fumble YouTube Biased As Always
Came here to watch cowboys. Left being scared of our division rivals
who else is watching cowboy highlights to see how good they pair up with the 49ers.  So far im not to impress 49ers have alot of adversity
Number one offense bc of that weak ass division. Brig them hardhats Cowgirls
love how you cut out the fumble because you know that the refs blow. Yall need to really figure something out with the trashy refs.
Cowboys will get another chance to beat the Cardinals at home. Are the Cardinals Kryptonite to the Cowboys? Maybe, the Cardinals seemed to come out on top of the Boy's in these game's especially when the Cowboys are home favorite's...
America won that day!!!🇺🇸
What # is J.J. Watt
Y doesn’t everyone want to bounce back against us 😢
Hi cowboys fans, welcome to the world of playing non-NFC East teams. Stop bragging about your record when you might as well play college teams (it would be about the same difficulty of games)
2:53 Holding against #79 against d-law.
Shut down the run game and the Cowboys lose. It’s very simple
Dallas needs to see if any vets CBs free agents can be grab before the playoff for cheap
I'm upset that the Cardinals won, the Rams should have clinched the NFC West by virtue of a Cowboys win, but the Cowboys lost, to hell with the Cardinals, they had their chance, they blew it! to me, they don't deserve to win the NFC West, it should fall on the Rams now.
Kingsbury and Murray are better when they're the underdogs, due to injury or whatever, because they don't go in overconfident expecting to dominate, calling big plays and fancy plays, and forgetting the basics of staying ahead of the sticks. The humiliating Lions loss was a good thing.
does look like a fumble, o well Geaux Saints
Cowboys trying to use pats trick plays (the double play) was cute 🤣
1:48  wtf
TOM BRADY12 the greatest sportsman in sporting history is about to win for the eighth and last time (as a player) the Super Bowl why? Because he is the greatest of all, he is the symbol of the most beautiful and exciting game in the world, American football. With his victory, the NFL will become the sports emblem of all sports on the planet and a glorious story to be told in the academy books. The NFL will frame the most beautiful season, the one to cry, to remember forever to children and grandchildren.
I'm a lifelong Cowboys fan, but the team doesn't have what it takes to tangle with the Bucs, Packers or Rams in the playoffs.
PRESCOTT IS THE SHITTIEST QUATERBACK..LOOOL
Cooper only has 700 yards I hate Dak he’s a fckn hater
that 5:30 pi call was terrible
Isaiah Simmons showing LOTS of improvement 👏👏
Cowboys shouldn’t be blitzing alot, ik they tryna pressure kyler but it was 3 &9 and they blitzed and kyler had no coverage on his recivers, ez pass,
Reffs getting paid out lol
The cowgirls just don't beat good teams, they've been this way for years, their always overated because people know they have a large market of ignorant fans.
Brown does some of the dumbest things. And I know they try and teach em what not to do in certain situation and I’ll be darned if Brown don’t go out there and give up a Touchdown 🙄
Did not think the Cards had a chance in this one b/c they were missing key guys on defense and had lost three in a row. Pleasantly surprised to see them win. Go Cards !
Luke 11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.  Matthew 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  Luke 14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:  Proverbs 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  1 Corinthians 11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?  Psalms 20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.  Psalms 60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.  KJV
There is zero defense in the NFL hard to watch almost every wide receiver is wide open this new style of football sucks all penalties no defense IF YOU CAN HEAR ME IT SUCKS
Dallas is falling back down to earth
The Cardinals tried their best to lose, but an ugly win is still a win.....
Robbery
gallup reminds me of dez
I don't know why Cowboy fans are tripping atm! Let's wait to see how the playoffs end before we cast slander. We still in reg season. Yea we were flagged a lot, but if you look at the statistics the Cowboys are #2 in the league, for penalties. Raiders #1. It makes sense as both those teams are the most negatively perceived inside the NFL world. imo. That translates to the refs as well.
Elliot is a disappointment. Bum!
This is terrible for the Cowboys they lost to a team missing 10 players and still lost only missing Jarwin.Thats not a good look
Kyler Murray was masterful ! Go Cards !
Cowboys play in a piss poor division that is the reason why they are in the playoffs. They will be one and done !
Kyler is a better QB than Dak.
Dak will not look to dump it off. Tight end is a couple of yards on the left side of Dak bottom of screen running free and he could have easily dumped it off. ANY QB would have seen this because you are looking to do it. He has looked for Zeke a million times this way.
Love how they couldn’t challenge lmaooo
I'm over here getting mad at a game I already watched. 😂 It's always the stupidest little things that make us lose.  P.I., Zurlein missing, Dropped interception, Dak fumbling. Tragic. 🤦‍♂️
I love the color rush uniforms, but it seems like we always lose when we wear them. 😅
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} oooweee  GREAT  GAME..!!
2:53 a Arizona cardinals are holding demarcus Lawrence
Can’t wait for this rematch
I can tell that just watching our offense this game that we were scared we didn’t throw deep at all besides the trick play and the td to Gallup more trick plays and more deep shots and please Dallas fix the run game.
Hmm Cow Sheep fans got quiet again. I told you can't beat good teams. Had mad celebration after beating Washington dang I thought you guys won the super bowl smh. Now look at you blaming the refs and the head coach as usual. You guys need to take a look at the average QB you got who folds up whenever it comes to playing good teams. He is not capable of putting the team on his shoulders when it comes to beating the Tier 1 QB's. Winning super bowls is not about being a nice guy and locker room leader. Give me that jerk or crazy obsessed QB who can put the team on his back and win titles and that's who I would take. Cowboys offense are depending on the defense to get them turnovers which creates shorter field to work with so they can have points off it and look great ala those inferior teams. Average head coach, over paid QB , over paid and over the hill running back who looks hurt, don't mention the wide receiver who has gone into hiding period. He was good at home and bad on the road now he's out of sink at home also for 20 million!!! All 3 of those players need to give Jerry back some money they robbed him!!!  Cowboys defense is a smoke screen for the many holes the secondary has. One line backer and Diggs who got some int's but has also given up a ton of yardages in doing so but I still give him some props. Whenever the front 4 gets blocked up that defense is in serious trouble especially that secondary. Micah is a good player and can cover but who else can match up one v one not counting Diggs?? Oh snap your D coordinator relinquished a 28 - 3 lead in the Super Bowl so more problems there soon . Only a matter of time before you turn against him and make more excuses. Your O coordinator needs to grow some hair and quit trying to please his QB all the time by throwing the ball. Good defenses are realizing that the running game is not a massive threat so your play action is not as effective like you would want it to be. Head Coach only won once with Rogers and Dak ain't no "double check " not in his class as yet but hopefully he can make major improvements and get there. But honestly and I'm sticking to my word for now until proven otherwise he can only win against inferior teams or everything has to be perfect from everywhere else on the team. So in closing the Cowboys can only win this year Super Bowl by playing perfect football and hope the rest of the teams play absolutely terrible  and not by brilliant Head coaching or average performance from your QB.
Cowboys are 1-6 when they do not rush for 100yards or more this season. Good thing they are paying their QB 40mill....
Kyler had a touchdown but threw it short on green when they only got 3 instead
Cowboys fan: "We gone win Superbowl"  🤡
Always keep God first
God bless you guys Always keep God first
another game blown by greg zuerline
oh boy now we gotta listen for a whole week about why the cowboys are sucking so bad on every NFL media channel
Man losin Gallup wit da ACL tear is gonna hurt em in da playoffs hope em well hope Amari Cooper and Ceedee take a huge leap forward as well as Cedric Wilson but Dalton Schultz has been doin great this season so hopefully that will be all they need and Trevon Diggs has been doin well as well as Demarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory when healthy
I believe Cowboys will bounce back and be ready for  Cardinals in the Wildcard. However, I think it's time Dallas needs to part ways with Ezekiel Elliot & Amari Cooper.  Draft another person for the O-Line in the first round & draft a Runner Back in the 2nd or 3rd Round.
This game makes me wonder why dbs drop back so much.
For your analysis:  highlights 2nd quarter, 4:18....a play completion....by Prescott....coaches threw that in for his qb...a challenge well executed by cowboys quarterback.... thats how good your team is...coming from a 49ers fan, as I, that ought to ease Mr. Jerry Jones' nerves. Cowboys to the nfc championship....
Mccarthy's time management is straight trash🤦
Pain. Cowboys always fold under pressure
Elliot is done in Dallas
On this pass interference  ITWAS THE WRONG CALL WITHOUT TOUCHING  THE RECEIVER  THE BACK  TOUCHES  THE BALL  FIRST WITHOUT  INTERFERING  WITH THE RECEIVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So happy to see the girls lose.
not a Card fan, but I must say Murray is FUN to watch 🙂
])allas CRYboys....boo hoo!
The Cowboys might be this year’s 2020 Steelers.
3:45 man what a catch!
They lost to the colts, but beat the cowboys??..... mkayy
Lol y’all made a huge mistake paying Dak Prescott and now you’re stuck. This is what Jerry Jones gets for listening to fans instead of logic. HE knew Dak wasnt good enough but y’all pressured the man for 3 years to overpay an average QB. Dak is BARELY better than a healthy Baker Mayfield yet is making 10x the money. For all that give me Baker and the commercials.
We were Victims of KM7 as well !! Ninergang!!
Not a Cardinals Fan, or a Cowboys fan. But that pass interference @5:52 is bullshit. pass was so low it might as well have been 6' under.
I'm died hard cowboys since 1990. I knew the first qt to see they have shorter guy to cover the taller widerecieving(dismatch)they correct right of way. Oh well let see if they are watching the film and ready for Saturday night game.
as a cardinals fan, I’m confident that we have a chance of winning the super bowl this year :)
Lol cowboys gotta face reality of what is going to happen eventually in the playoffs they will be going home LMAO
Antoine Wesley popped off. He can have AJ Green's spot
If the defense knocks you out of bounds, I'd like to give them credit for doing so. Years ago the rule was changed to allow the defense to push a WR out before they come down with possession. I'd like to see that extended. Put the onus on the offense. You wanna keep the clock running? Then it's up to the runner to stay in bounds and/or run up the middle. But if the defense is able to knock or drag you out of bounds within a reasonable extension of the play, I'd like to give them credit.
Cowboys overrated AF. Easiest schedule hands down. Can't beat a decent team
care=ds made some Wtf plays dang it
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH WE ARE THE REAL JEWS REPENT
Zuerline lost another game. Cowboys need a new kicker
Dallas could not win with crocket refs!
That was a fumble
I always thought Trevon Diggs's number of interceptions is overrated. Because, he gave up so many yards and people don't afraid to throw on his way. It's not like Deion Sander which people didn't want to throw on Deion.
THE PROBLEM IS THE COACHING STAFF, MAINLY THE HC and Kellen Moore!!!!!!!!!! Do you think if Bill Billicheck had this team they would be so inconsistent! I THINK NOT!
Dak is back! In a slump!!
I hope Philly runs up the score against Da Girls next week.
im js cards RB clearly fumbled the ball and the refs was paid by murray so they made sure to say he was down by contact which is BS yall must of been watching a different game cuz nobody has even mentioned that play i believe there was like 2:42 left in the 4th clearly if you go look every angle his knee NEVER touched the ground, we recovered... mccarthy also panicked that half and waisted all 3 timeouts. so the refs had the perfect chance to make sure the cards won pay attention more its been out there for a while now its "entertainment" not football.. oh well philly better be ready i know that much. cuz we get to win that game then lose to GB in the champ game espn already told us the outcome for this year
That fake punt looked like the Arizona guy caught it, an amazing catch. It looked like he had control of the ball and was down. Not sure what the rule is if you’re pinning the ball against someone else. Anyone know the rule here? (I realize it’s moot because of the pass interference, but still would be interesting to know. If that was a catch, it’s one of the most amazing ones ever).
Dallas should have these uniforms as their primary home uniforms. Real sharp!!!!!!!
Lolol Trevon Diggs is so overrated.  Either he gets burnt like toast or he gets an INT.  Diggs has allowed over 1000 yards receiving this year, he's pretty much the opposite of a shutdown corner.
Dak hasn't played well and he did get outplayed by Murray by a mile. A rematch with Dak playing well, Cowboys should handle them even with Hopkins back. Dak has been struggling.
If the Cardinals are healthy and play their best football, they beat anyone.
6:00 the sun on that ball made it look like it was on fire!!
Don't forget the cowboys beat a Washington  team who had 28 starting injured/covid list....so pump your brakes cowboys fans
Dak just ain’t good against good teams
I keep telling yellow that the cowboys is trash
Kyler is so fluid..a true athlete!
as a cowboys fan, I hope we get of Anthony brown for a better corner
That was the most underwhelming reaction to Jonathon wards helmet catch! Easily the best catch of the year
How bout them cowgirls
Murrary might never lose in that stadium
OMG THAT WAS CLEASRLY A FUMBLE AT THE END. WATCH IT AT THE SLOWEST SPEED. NOTICE THE BALL COMES OUT BEFORE HE GOES DOWN. SUCKS WE COULDNT CHALLENGE IT
Nice to see the Arizona Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys!
WAY TO GO CARDINALS
Listen guys. Please don’t get caught  up in all this analytics. This is a good and well balanced Cowboy team. This very close loss provided the coaches, the players and opportunity to really evaluate themselves and fine tune some things. It was a winnable game against a quality opponent who was desperate for a win. We didn’t play our best and still loss by 3. We can point a multitude of reasons from penalties, a Missed field goal, line play, dropped passes, untimely time outs, lack of a consistent run game, lack of pressure without blitzing to the refs. This is a any given Sunday league. We are and will be one of the best teams remaining. We have a chance to beat Arizona or Philly first. And then beat whoever they put in front of us in this any given Sunday league. My hopes are that no one KEY to our mission gets COVID or injured. We know we can function without Gallop. As you know I personally believed he got open deep more than the rest.  Our super bowl teams with the triplets were like 11-5 at best.  Let’s smack the hell out of philly this week! Let’s run up our stats. Don’t let doubt in.
Got out played out coached 👍🏼
All I'll say is that Y'all are delusional if you're blaming number 4 for this loss.
A.J green burnt Trevon a couple of times, imagine wat dhop would've done.
Cowboys got cheated
Yes the refs screwed the Boys at the end there with the delay of game and the fumble not called but we shouldn't have to rely on them to see if we win or not. The Boys defence allowed a field goal at the end of the first half and dropped an interception which got Arizona another 3 points. Without those points, Arizona would've had 19 points vs the Cowboys 22. To add more to the injury, our kicker missed yet another FG. That would've put us at 25-19. Not saying Arizona wouldn't have scored on their final drive or what not, but they would've had the pressure to score a TD instead. Missed opportunities for the Boys.
👀@ the 💰Jerry Jones is shelling out for an undisciplined team. The Cowboys have issues and it begins and ends with the head coach not preparing a team to play consist ball games.  They have too many penalties and so-so offensive line that cannot protect the quarterback.  They don't have what it takes to be a quality team and that is disappointing.
Number 7 is the worst db or at least one of the worst I’ve seen This year. Gets beat off the line and immediately grabs cloth. He needs to quit all that talking and get to working.
Yet again us cowboys fan have too high hopes for the cowboys only to be heart crushed with a long week ahead. 😞
I called it..
Prayers up to Gallup🙏🏾../
The commentator is clearly a biased cowboy lunatic fan. He spews propaganda that the cowgirls have the number one offense in the league. L o L  !!!!!!!  That's a good bedtime story. Pathetic exaggeration of the most overrated team in the league.
Dak is all BARK & NO BITE
they need to make tony pollard run it more often I think hes better than elliot
Wow... That fumble was the game... But it shouldn't have been that clise
Maybe it's time to consider another quarterback
Hey jerry jones cowboys are not a super bowl team Cowboys fan need to remember that !!!!
Sounds about right,  Dak and Cowboys can't win when it matters most.  Offense is playing all its starters/weapons and still lose.  Cards are missing key players and win the game??? Yea, these Cowboys still need to look for a head coach that can get them to win big games.
It’s really funny when the NFL highlights skip the controversial calls by officials
Dallas before Washington- “offense is broken, defense is strong” Dallas after Washington- “we’re back baby! Never a doubt in our offense!” Dallas very next game with Arizona- “offense is trash” There indeed is something wrong with the offense… is it play calling? Is it Dak? I’m not smart enough to know…
lol he’s clearly down and out of bounds cowboys fans always gotta have some conspiracy theory / blame the refs when they lose 🤣
LETS GOOO CARDS !!! Can’t wait for the playoffs 🔥🔥😭
Why were everyone booing amari
That Wesley can ball 🏈
That's some B.S. Total fumble there at the end. I slow motioned it.
Leave it to Joe Buck to not understand that the fake punt play ended in a catch.
Is it me!? Joe buck sounds different
1st quarter..missed FG.. that 3 pts would have tied it.
That's part of getting them out of here
Zeke sucked ass this game.  And the loss of Gallup for the year hurts bigtime.
Y’all realize that the cardinals purposefully acted like they were going for it on 4th down at one point when there was no reason to which caused the cow girls to use a timeout that they would’ve used to challenge and possibly tie it or win it
If a QB makes blatant mistakes against zone...Diggs will be an interception machine. Otherwise, he just gets smoked 1v1.
I didn't even watch the game I knew we were gonna lose we gone lose next week too just wait and see smdh
Sorry ass Cowgirls are one and done 😂😂😂
DAK PRESCOTT SUCKS!…NEW QB ASAP!
Refs robbed us once again 🙂we’ll beat them in their house in the playoffs not worried one bit
Dallas just isn't good enough to overcome bad officiating and coaching, especially when the kicker misses this season... Almost tho but not quite
#1 offense in the NFL? 🤔 I'm sorry I don't see Tom Brady 🐐 in the field. 🤔🤔🤔
The NFC is going to be a blood bath 🛀
1:48 yooo wtf was that noise?! Hahaha sounded crazy
Az. Cardinals son el coco de Dallas, por eso no quieren ir a Arizona a jugar, se la pelan allá 🤣🤣🤣
I'm not a cowboy fan, but Dallas deserves a better owner. Jerry Jones does not know football. An owner who understands the game would carry their franchise to greater heights again.
The Arizona Cardinals are 11-5🔴⚫️ they snapped their 3 game losing streak
https://m.youtube.com/shorts/DleTpC2eWhY
As a Cowboys fan we had this coming a team like the Cardinals needed this win but we got to get it together for the playoffs if not we will be first round exits
Talk about a catch wow 😯
NFL is way better now with the option to go for 2 points after a TD, and making the 1-point kick harder.
just another cowboys team that will watch the SB from home.
That 3rd and 8 with 13:02 in the 2nd quarter...DLaw got held and it was obvious. And number 61 was holding too. DLaw was completely by #75   Holding and not getting called is what equalized the Cards and the Cowboys rush.  They were being held often and the refs were letting it go. Straight BS.
The Cowboys have to be one of the most frustrating "superbowl contenders" ever. The #1 offense is prone to stagnation. Their big unit of a running back often gets stuffed like he's 150.Their franchise QB misses open throws way too often for what he's getting paid. What should be an at least decent Oline gives up way too much pressure. The kicker can't go one game without missing a costly kick or PaT. The talented defense is prone to head scratching lapses and back breaking penalties. And that missed pick in the endzone. Come on, you CANNOT let a gift like that go to waste. A game changing missed opportunity.
Man timthetatmans team sucks.
You can not play like this & expect to win in a super bowl, let alone a playoff game...Dallas😫😑
Cowboys are a first round exit in the playoffs unless they play the eagles
I don’t watch or know a lot about american football but that quarterback on the white team seems pretty bad, made a bunch of bad passes or took way too long
The refs in the NFL are crooked and paid off by vegas shot callers.  The head of the NFL is a scumbag and I no longer watch it.
Shoooooow Meeeeee Theeeee 💰💰💰💰💰💰
DAK is the problem: he won't throw to the receivers if there is no separation. All great/good quarterback will throw the ball in the coverage if he thinks the receiver has a slight chance to catch the ball.
ANYTHING IN QUESTION ABOUT A FUMBLE THE REFS WILL NORMALLY LOOK AT IT....WHY THEY DIDN'T IS ANOTHER MYSTERY AND BLACK EYE ON NFL OFFICIATING? HORRIBLE ARE THE ZEBRA'S💯👈👀🙈
Defense and offense was off again.. I'm tired of us losing to teams we need to win. I think it's time for a new oc this year
It is very satisfying watching the Cowboys lose.  Go Phoenix! Go Cardinals!
This won't cut it come playoff time
“We are who I thought we were!”   - Me, A Dallas Fan
I'm still salty about Cards messing up my parlay against  the lions
I'm just here to rewatch the loss good job arizona I'm not a fan but anytime Dallas looses good job 👏
Cardinal aren’t going to the super bowl they suck ass
Folks from the US do what you want, but this is just one more attempt to devalue the US Dollar. If I were not living in the USA  Would of course buy bit coin but as an American, I'm investing in my own future
If only the cowboys had a better fg kicker they might have won
Forgot yall had Zeke and cooper lmao
I just checked not a fumble good cal
Got too see this W live
This was a good ass game NFC championship game if they don't see each other in the 1st round
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!🤣
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
26 years since a deep post season show. 26. One of the most wealthiest franchises in sports. Huge fan base. But yet still can't compete against great teams and win the BIG games. It looks like there's no heart. You look at teams like Kansas City and Los Angeles that actually try. Such a disappointment with so much talent.
I thought Dallas was gonna win but I’m still happy
11:15 Isaiah Simmons with that Kam Chancellor punch out
They won’t make it through the first round of the play offs. Dak will find a way to screw it up
Ecclesiasticus 43:6-10 He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.

That fake punt was amazing by the Arizona Cardinals!!!
Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals prevailed against the Dallas Cowboys on the road in Dallas!!! Kyler Murray is undefeated in Texas!!! Let's go Cardinals!!! Rise up sea red!!! How bout them bird's in Arizona!!! Victory for Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals!!! Go Cardinals!!! They also end the losing streak too!!!
Cowboys will destroy them next time if we meet again  paybacks a B****
I really don’t know why The cowboys stopped being so aggressive on 4th downs, if you look at the first 6 weeks when they did go for 4th more often than not, they were kicking ass and the offense was clicking big time, now that they’re playing more conservative it seems they can’t get it going until late in games. Just my observation
This did not feel as close as it was. Cardinals put on a clinic in the first half. Felt so good to watch.
DAK isn’t the future for Dallas… time and time again he disappears against good teams and gets praise for beating trash teams.. we need a legitimate QB .. not a fake as QB…
It was upsetting watching the Card's loose a few straight games but just watching them play their hearts out was very satisfying ..A breath of hope to try to win it all..
Cowgirls Head Ball Coach Jerrah Jones:  "All Hat And No Cattle!"
How bout them Cowgirls? 🤠  🐮 🐄
As a Cardinals fan I was ready to hand this game to the Cowboys. They were healthy and on a winning streak, whereas the Cardinals were unhealthy and on a 3 game losing streak. But the truth is the Cowboys just suck!!!!
Something is fishy about this game.
tHiS iS oUr YeAr beat 10+ win teams consistently
I love watching the cowboys lose. Favorite part of football. They always show the owners sad face when they lose too. It's great.
We accept the lost last night but that play when the cardinals fumble the ref seen that 💯regardless
Both defenses seem to have suffered from some dodgy penalty calls.
Poor dallas
Cowboys need fourth downs against our secondary lol
All the years I have been watching football games and all I can say anything can happen every given Sunday. I agree the Cards needed this win but then again they are a better away team, go figure. Azc4L 🏈💯
Anyone realized a dude with surname Wesley beat Dallas Cowboys? It's not "Shut up Wesley", it's "Touchdown Wesley".
All the haters are proving themselves right. Cowboys can’t beat good teams. Simple as that. Tampa, KC, Arizona and let’s be honest we could’ve lost that game in New England because sorry ass brown had a no call PI that would’ve sealed the L for Dallas. McCarthy and his useless game management. Im tired of being one and done in the playoffs man. And Dallas plays this exact same team wildcard weekend. See you guys next year.
man i wouldn’t bet a ants life on the cowboys offense
You can always tell in the first quarter of a Cowboys game if it's gonna be one of *those* games.
We Won and that's all it matters. GO CARDINALS
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS 🤫
The coboys aren't Americas team.
Yes Go Arizona Cardinals!! I am ecstatic that they beat cowboys! Cowboys suck period!!!! Always will too LoL!
The coach you guys call a coach for Dallas Cowboys Mike M.     Is not a coach
Can I just say If Andy Lee was holding our kicks we would’ve beat the Colts but it is what it is glad we got a dub here
“#1 offense in the nfl” we will not be successful in the postseason if we do not get this run game going!
I ain’t gon lie bu we would’ve won if da ref counted em last 3 min a fumble 4 da cardinals cause it was a fumble
why do we still have Zuerlein? He cost us so many games
Y’all do realize the refs won the cardinals the game so say what y’all want about the cowboys there ready for the super bowl
Aj green was burning Diggs
4:45 looks like a madden game cut scene after you score a touchdown
0:27 why didn’t he go to the crossing route?
Looks like Dallas has same zebra problem KC had this week!! It's a shame when refs interfere with such big games!! If it's blatantly obvious I get it but let them play!!
goddamn it. another year of disappointment.
Win or lose i react each week! Go cowboys! We will be fine!
Like they say Murray never loses in Texas. But still a good game that catch though by Ward.
Cowboys are done. This is the preview to their playoff exit game.
This defense is so overrated the secondary is a complete ass
Lol they couldn’t beat a recent struggling cards team 😂😂😂😂
Micheal Gallup 😈💪🏽
Dallas needed this loss to get them back to reality- The Defense lost this game  they  allowed the Cards  to push them around which  is unacceptable  especially after the Lions  destroyed them They can go into playoffs with a different   mindset now
13:30 should've been a delay of game, oh well
That’s fake punt throw cardinals was a great play and catch
It’s always funny seeing the fans reaction when cowboys lose 😈😂
Dak already practice his diss appointment face look funny he just stunned and looks crazy it’s funny
Cowboys struggle with good defenses but cowboys defense is top 5
This was not the offenses fault idk what y’all’s problem is with kellen Moore we have the #1 offense in the league we need to be worried about our defense. I mean we got some good guys but they are young we need to stay on them and keep them healthy this was the defenses fault. Best game the cardinals have played all year
How about them cowwwwwboooyysss🗣
Refs won the game for Arizona! It was a good loss for my Cowboys..
Didn't see the game...fumble or not?
Just shows dallas will be a failure again in the playoffs
It’s weird. When dak throws 30 passes and 25 of them fly 3 yards in the air they can’t score
75 million dollars for 16 weeks of underperformed gametime what a joke
No doubt who the best QB was on the field. Did Prescott even attempt a pass over 20 yards? Cowboys not going anywhere.
Cards going for 2 while up 12 in the 3rd quarter? Coach Kliff, WTF? Take the damn points. That kind of stupid decision almost sent us into overtime. Take the dang points. Those missed opportunities always come back at the end.
As bad as Arizona has played lately, they still have the most dangerous offense in the league. Even as a wildcard they could still make a very deep playoff run.
prescott is an inconsistent Quarterback!!
I still can’t believe Dak and Zeke have superstar x-factor in Madden
Cowboys vs the Refs. That was a fumble at the end
How did Baker Mayfield start in front of Murray.
Eagle's are definitely taking that W next week 🤙
Troy was about to cry lol
Diggs gotta learn when to jump and when not to jump. those double moves were killing him but it's an easy fix. also feel like Parsons needs to fill that MLB slot against teams with mobile QBs like Kyler, bc he's fast enough to track them down if they decide to get wild and is good enough in coverage. offense gotta figure it out tho.
cowboys vs refs just like the raiders game
Let’s Go Cardinal
mcarthy...
Not a fan of either team but watching that game either team could have won handily if not for a few plays (interceptions, pass interference, fumbles) so don’t complain about one play because it coulda went either way all game
Cowboys going to girls.  Super bowl...they are chokers...
All of the Dallas Cowboys receiver’s are AVERAGE. We’ve billed this team as having an amazing offense but all it’s skill players perform like average players in the NFL.
Trashboys 😭🤣
That TD was givin to the cowsmurfs.
They played us on that fumble, he coughed it up on that last play would have been overtime or a victory for the Cowboys. Referees suck like hell.
The cards were missing so many guys on the road and still pulled this out! The cowboys secondary is overrated all over and their kicker stinks!!
Good job by the Cards. Dallas came out real slow on offence and i als feel like there was a lack of intensity on defence while both sides pi ked it up nearing the final stretch the defense just could not get a stop to give the O another shot. Shame but good learning moment hopefully cuz the games are going to be much tougher in 2 weeks
SOOO proud of Defense and Especially Isiah Simmons, Budda, and Chandler.  Simmons has Consistently made game changing plays all Year and Offense feeds off that Energy.  Thank You for a "Contender Type" of a showing.  Kliff also gets credit this time for jamming up their plans and burning a time out that proved crucial at the end of the game.  Bet those "experts" picking the Cowboys to destroy us are eating Humble Pie ALL WEEK Long 🤣🤣🤣
At least my St. Louis blues are doing good and there’s some good avs fans that admitted the blues were a scary team but so are the avs themselves this is good for blues it’s good for blues to play the good teams if you know what I’m saying and getting at cowboys should be able to beat these teams if not they won’t go to super bowl
Sorry to get your hopes up other cowboys fans but we aren’t going to the Super Bowl this proves it that we can’t handle these teams pathetic so embarrassing
Stupid ass team how embarrassing this is why we will never go to a super bowl sorry excuse of a team
That might have been the greatest interception I've ever seen. Damn.
best offensive in the NFL? DAllas?  hahaha
Missed field goal. Dak critical fumble. Brown can’t cover anyone. Another normal day for my Cowboys.
Hate the cards but good win over the cowboys
Dallas didn't make it easy for them and cards didn't make it easy for Dallas either! But when playoffs come they sure do need to step their game up against those winning record good teams man!
This season never should have been played.  Covid, idiots?  I mean, how greedy can you get, NFL?  Putting countless human beings lives at risk just so you can make more money.  How pathetic.
Thank you cardinals for helping my Bucs
Can’t be americas team when half your fans are illegal.
that was a fumble at 2:38 in the 4th
Dallas plays better when Cedric Wilson out their one more chance need to beat the eagles
To think of James Conner would’ve been playing to get the goal line work 😤
I love how the cowboys are complaining about penalties called against them, but nothing about the penalties called on the cardinals. They're the right calls, they're just salty.
Cowboys versus refs
Cowboys finally play a team with a winning record and they loose 🤡
Jesus Love's You & Repent for the Kingdom of God is At Hand Jesus is Coming Quickly !!!🙌 Heaven Here We Come 😁
Dal started way too slow . If we couldve made that field goal in the 1st , it woulda been OT . Cmon greg
These dallas  losses always start the same. Momentum is real  if the game starts with a few stops of our offense   and they get on the board first that's gonna be the story of the game. Go back and just look at our wins.   I knew this was headed for a loss after the first 20 minutes
Kind of figured we’d drop this game. Cardinals we’re more desperate for a win in this one
Like I said before typical Cowboys they beat up on all the scrubs but when they play a team with a winning record or a playoff team they blow it.
Waiting on the cowboy fans to blame the referees.. even though 10 were called on the cowboys seven on the Cardinals it had nothing to do with Dallas coach calling a timeout because he never seen a kicker and quarterback on the field at the same time and they were out coached
Cardinals needed it and wanted it just a little more. The turnover made by Simmons and the Kyler factor were the edge.
How about them dem Boyz hahahhahahaha
Kellen Moore sucks big time against good teams dude has no balls and should be fired but he wants to call good plays once the game is on the line right 🤷‍♂️
qb throws pass to the ground Refs: Pass Interference
Star players complaining about the refs after the game is not a winning attitude,the QB needs to play better and the defense also especially in key moments in the game,those 90s teams hated losing,this team just makes excuses.They are talented enough to win a Super Bowl but they are too inconsistent and not disciplined enough. How far will they go in playoffs?
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS LOL
:7:39 number 2 says n word
Pack wins, cowboys lose, times are good
I don’t understand why people are surprised. Every packers fan knows the cowboys are done bc of Mike McCarthy. McCarthy is the worst coach to ever win a super bowl and it’s not even close. He should be calling Aaron Rodgers every night thanking him for still having a job
Anytime the Cowboys loose it's a Good Day..!!!
The Cowboys should give Goodell the finger by sitting all the starters for the flexed prime time Eagles game.
We need a new KICKER!! HAD HE MADE FIRST FIELD GOAL KICK IN FIRST QAURTER WE WOULD OF BEEN TIED. ..IN 4TH QUARTER.
It’s clearly coming down to the Packers vs Bucs for the NFC Championship. Sorry Cards and Cowboys and Rams fans. This game showed why neither AZ or Dallas is making it out of the NFC. Stafford has shown that he is still too mistake prone and misses too many throws to make it to the SB. The Bucs were recently shutout by Carolina and needed a big comeback in the 4th quarter yesterday just to beat the Jets…. 😬 The Packers clearly have a history of choking in the playoffs, but it just seems like Green Bay is the least likely team to lay an egg in the tournament this season.
is noone going to talk about 3:29 ? that is one of the greatest Catches i have ever seeen!!!
This year is great because it seems like everyone has a chance at winning it all
wow, those reffs in Dallas seem to be deep in Jones' pockets.
I was at the game and I'm sure I saw gallop tare his ACL
the cards bouncing back like that against the cowboys really impressed me
GG cards see ya again in a few weeks
Cowboys ass 🤣🤣
You call the WFT a bad team but give teams credit for beating us.
Greg Zurlein gotta go
NFL not showing the replay of questionable calls but showing a zebra directing air traffic... cowards
Dallas vs Cardinals & Refs = Never Win
Yall was talking all that junk but cardnails beat ass
We need people to bet against us we are good..
Everyone’s saying that the cowboys can’t compete with bigger teams but it was a 3 point game both teams put up a good fight
SINCE JIMMY JOHNSON LEFT THE COWBOYS I'M CONTENT TO SEE THEM WIN A DIVISION CHAMPS THESE " ATHLETES " PLAYING WITH SO MUCH INCONSISTENTCY WILL NEVER WIN A CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP NEVER THE LESS A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP  LAST WEEKEND GAME WAS A BAD DEFENSE NOT A GOOD OFFENSE
Got damn how many blown calls are going to blow games for us this year? Jesus Christ. The cowboys did not play good but they made a play at the end of the game to give themselves a chance to win but the refs make a call they are “certain” is right on the field and it turns out it is not. Challenge or not, the right call is supposed to be made. If turnovers are always reviewed why are potential game changing plays that are potential turnovers not automatically reviewed? We always get the short end on refs call, no bs. It’s become absolutely ridiculous
I told you Dallas fans competition is on its way to town
whenever pollard has more than 8 yards on 1 run hes just so close to taking it to the house and scoring a td if he just lowers his shoulder kind of like zeke and trucks people then he could go all the way (anyone else notice that?)
Cowboys are pure trash 🗑🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 1 and done in playoffs you cowboy fans get yall heart broke every year 💔 I love it 😭🤣✌🏽
I still think the Cowboys are still pretenders
Every team that needs a must win , wins . HMMM
To the cowboys fans that wanted to fight me after the game yesterday, your team still sucks. Glad I made those bets last minute. Thank you Kyler Murray 🙏
That's what happens when you play a team from the NFC WEST baby boys.. hope my niners see cowboys in the playoffs 🙏
my team is out.  we are the joke of the neighborhood, but i still, all in all, think this was the absolute best football i've ever witnessed this year.  the detroit lions, beat the cardinals, and now the cardinals are beating dallas.  football is just like that forever and forever i love it.  we love to play.  hope all the calls are right and no one gets hurt, play ball, happy new year . . . respect the game.
It was a fumble..
Troy Aikman: I don't know if they got that off, barely if they did. Me: They didn't get that off. It should've been delay of game (00). The REF's missing alot of calls this year.
COWBOYS WISH THEY HAD KYLER MURRAY HAHAHA
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYSSSSS LMAO😂😂😂😂everytime yous play a decent team yous get beat. But yeah it's your year again lol
Thank you Cardinals, for the guaranteed first-round bye.  From, Packers fans.
Micah Parsons was right this was a statement game but for the Cardinals not Dallas
Cowboys only win against bad teams as soon the play team with winning record they loose...
Dallas could've won if they kept passing underneath. Dak Prescott is not the air marshall that they seem to think he is.
As a cowboys fan, we gotta NOT enter playoff mode.
Dallas needs to bring Jason Garrett back to help with the Dak and the offense.  Dak was at his best when Garret and Moore were on the sideline together.
dakota fumble wow! missing Fg Zeke non factor Cards were better team cowgirls one and done in playoffs they cant beat a good team period!
Dallas is sooooooo mediocre.  And Dak is just Meh!.  I don't get the decisions this organization makes. I'm no Dallas fan but this mediocrity is beyond ridiculous.  How hard is it to accept what you see?  Dake is just Meh.  Your coach is Meh.  Y'all paid bot like they are exceptional but you need a better QB for sure and should be on the lookout to upgrade your coach.  Makes for poor competition in the league and really not fun to watch either.
Wentz has more rings than Dak...still
If the kicker on Dallas would’ve made the first FG they might’ve had a better chance at winning. Maybe lol
We lost because Kellen Moore don’t run the damn ball. Pass on 1st down, pass on 2nd and 2, pass, pass, pass. Zeke and pollard combined had 10 touches, shits ridiculous!
Go Cards
That fumble from Dak was pretty significant.. twas a great defensive play tho so it's okay.
Fumble!!
Not a Dallas fan or hater but something seems wrong with Daks arm. How many did he throw in the dirt? Even some of the ones his receivers were able to catch were hella low.
Dak doesnt have that star quality
It looks like #29 caught the ball anyway. He didn't have to cry to the referee's the way the Cowboys do.
Dak need to start running a little more.
Murray can't lose in Texas 9 0
What really makes me despise NFL Football is the celebrations in the End Zones after scores.  They (all these young kids) all need to watch Barry Sanders highlights.  He just handed the referee the ball after scoring.  These players act like strippers in a Strip Club.  Some of them are being paid even more money than Sanders made... but they act like children seeking attention.  It's really getting pathetic.  Watch a Belichick coached team and see how they behave like they belong in the End Zone... as they are paid to do.
Thank you from Green Bay💚
There’s a reason why I wasn’t jumping up and down like these delusional “fans”  Look at the QBs the cowboys have faced in their wins. Anthony Brown has been getting wrecked left and right constantly, ya boi got “mossed” up bad 😂
Another lost game due to a bad call from the refs. It WAS a fumble and dallas ball. But they couldn’t challenge it cuz they didn’t have a time out. That should have been a booth review. NFL NEEDS TO FIX THIS BS
This is what happens when Cowboys plays against contenders..
Dallas’s Dline was BIG mad at the end of this game 😂😂😂  sorry, America’s team!
Such a controversial way to end this one, but still a fun to watch.
This is definitely a one and done team. I don't think we've played our best ever since week 1 against the Bucs.
Can't beat the good teams. Same story for 25 years
On top of the lack of talent at the QB and RB positions and the overated O-line I feel Dallas's play calling is lacking also. They have well designed plays that are certainly better then those of the carrot 🥕 top era but I just don't see those plays specifically designed for that game to exploit weaknesses in the defense they are playing. Game planning is lacking and we see it in how quickly the run is abandoned in every game.
Defenses LOVE to play the Cowboys because rattling Dak is so easy....you act like there is a full blitz and back into coverage and wait for the pick he will throw..OR you just blitz and wait for him to fumble..its really that easy for defenses when you have absolutely no running game at all.
11<56!
Cowboys do this every year.1 and done
https://youtu.be/1Cy0B0DPE3A
This is the reason why the cowboys will not make it pass the first round in the playoffs. Sure, they’re 11-5, but that is only because a lot of the teams they have played were not that good. They lost to every good team they played this season. Cowboys fans don’t get your hopes up. This is not their year.
Mike McCarthy.  🤣 🤦‍♀️
Go Cardinals, F**K SKIP BAYLESS !! 😂
Dallas's O-line is overrated and there isn't any talent to make up for it at the QB and RB positions. Zeke no longer runs the way he did the first three years he was here and Prescott just isn't that good. There wasn't any slump with Prescott and what you saw yesterday and in the previous games is who he is. His entire career in Dallas is a mirror image of this season. The guy just misses to many throws, period!
Philadelphia Eagles AKA  the Goat...
Go Eagles go
Close but no cigar cowgirls you'll be watching the Super Bowl at home
They have to go into every game with a Attitude to win !! The refs won't have any effect on the game if their playing with the Attitude to destroy every opponent!! Throw some 30 to 40 yard passes twice each game and stop being so conservative!!
The sports announcer lied when he said Dallas has the number one offense in the league he meant to say the Philadelphia Eagles
Good coaching cardinals “ pat pat” on the back way to bring home the w!
The Cardinals are the only team whose players look like they are wearing helmets twice their normal size.
Dak’s never gonna take ANYONE to a Super Bowl and we have to stop wasting time with him. His reckless passes got CeeDee hurt, Gallup, and the defense depleted! He needs to sit down!
That fumble cost the game !!
Big D = big disappointment for 20 some yrs now for the fan.
I expected the cardinals to win this because Thayer want it badly and need momentum in the postseason
Still wondering how Joe Buck has a job.
Vander Esch is starting to be a liability on defense, he hasn't made a play in ages. We cant run block and our play style is so predictable its embarrassing.
Thank you Cardinal Nation.
Sucks we had to lose like that. It wasnt a pretty game anyway but to lose when we could have gotten that fumble really stinks. Murray is amazing and hats of to the cards.
7:47 Parsons makes a big play...Cowboys needed more of this. 12:25 Nice call to lateral pass to Wilson who then passes against the grain to Pollard. Big play that will be called again in the playoffs
Applesauce is fruit gravy!
Gotta love it. Against good teams they blow it. And against Washington  they're the best team ever. Lol. Too bad they don't have Washington  every week.
Hey look, no recievers took off they shirts or ran off the field. Professional athletes!
Watch the TD at 12:36 . The NFL has to keep the game close and #27 let the TD happen. Sad.
That looks like a gm changing fumble
I knew cowboys gonna lose this game
So much holding not called against dallas
Dak at it again. 🚮
So currently this is a wild card match up,the Cards might be favourites
Cards secondary is killing us!! They get beat and some times space out! Leaving wide open recievers... Vince jospeh can't adjust... NEEDS WORK!!! Front  defense did AMAZING... budda baker playing his ass off! every game RESPECT!  Simmons, jones... stepping up big...waiting on you GOLDEN!
That play was a fumble lol . In the playoffs Dallas games going to be a close game except for against the eagles lol. Sorry eagles fans
My team losing sucks. What is embarrassing is the players and coaches going in public and blaming the refs.
Anytime the cowboys plays a good team they lose
Dak has to run with the ball when necessary and we have to run the BALL.
I mean it's not like either of these teams are gonna do shyt in the playoffs 🤣🤣🤣 Funny game to watch tho😆
Michael Gallup is made of glass.
Can somebody please tell me how to skerp the erds
Dallas fans were sticking they chest out all yr and I been saying they overrated feasting on trash teams. Ain't no Heinicke, Daniel Jones in the playoffs. This game proved their pretenders like I been saying
The Cardinals blew a huge opportunity in the 2020 draft when they passed on CD Lamb in favor of Isaiah Simmons. We are witnessing what’s possible with Burrow/Chase when a college QB and receiver who already have a strong chemistry are brought together in the NFL.
3:16 7:28
Seemed like Dak Prescott was playing with some sort of concussion. He basic passing was awful. Another regulation first kick miss by Zuerlein, that cost us the game. No matter though, the Cowboys don`t seem to have a plan B when playing better teams. NFC championship game loss, would be an achievement this year, no better.
I hope Cardinals will win the SB, they really deserve it this time. But I think those injuries at the middle of the season will make some problems for them. Although the Packs are the toughest competitor for them, but they can beat them for the SB’s sake.
All im saying is there is going to be a major upset in the playoff I can’t wait
Cowboys fans cry when they lose but once y’all beat a bad team it’s #1 SB contender talk 🙄  Don’t worry you’ll be happy again when you beat a bad Philly team next week but you’ll go back to crying again in the playoffs 😂
This is the 3RD GAME WE SHOULD OF WON OR TIED!! Zuerlein!!! IS NOT RELIABLE!! DUMP THAT BUM!!!
So when are you going to accept that dak Prescott is not a great quarterback 😕.  Cowboys will lose  in the playoffs. I'm a cowboy fan
Climate crisis > football
Is it me or is the cards oline playing really well this season..🤔 Cedric Wilson with a good game, congrats cards they just looked faster on offense than Dallas' defense along with making some great plays, Parsons needs help at lb
Signing dak and zeke to big $ was a *big* mistake. "Boys are stuck with them and a load of talent (Pollard, receivers) that will go neglected.
Murray got the fastest feet in the NFL dude covers so much ground
Honestly I think cowboys just love beating themselves cause most of there drives ended with drops or penalties resulting in 3rd and forever plays . Also don’t get me started with Greg Zuerlein he’s literally one of the worst kickers I’ve ever seen I get he was good in the past but he’s been pretty terrible for us. I think the cowboys will probably win the playoff game against Arizona cause with all the terrible plays the cowboys played it was only a 3 point game with a (Terrible no call fumble) so yea i think this team can win a playoff game but I don’t see us winning a divisional epically with the terrible play by the oline .
Cowboys are not scaring anyone. They should be topping 100+ yards rushing every game between Elliot and Pollard. Also, Prescott is not a big game QB, so prepare for early exits come playoff time.
Dak the ball sak is doing his best..it just his best isn't good enough
Cowboys should of won...
Dak proving once again he's an overpaid Romo 2.0
Dak Prescott is simply not that guy!
I think the Cowboys are going to regret giving Dak all that money. He reminds me of Kirk Cousins in that he plays at an elite level against bad teams but against teams with a record over .500 he isn't great. With that massive contract the talent drain will set in and the Cowboys are going to start losing talent as cap casualties and Dak will be forced to carry the load which I do not believe he can do.
Well, i guess i gotta go to my 2nd team. Tompa Bay. Lol Darn it!! Dallas cant get it done, Brady can!!!
Is D hop injured?
Their 4th quarter comeback tells the story here!! Since of urgency, got cowboys going again!! So that sputtered around until that thought it was time to play football qgain!!! Go figure!!
dallas fans really stupid anough believe SB contender?
dallas beat horrible teams  lose Good teams😂😂😂
Prescott is okay. He doesn't look elite to me. Murray is brilliant. Happy for the Cards win.
Portland, JAMAICA in the Building !!!!!!!  🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Haha Dallas trash
Watching Dak fumble under pressure is so funny, he cant help himself.
Zuerline missing a FG and "Elliot the Idiot" fumbling cost a win. Coulda had this one easily.
need to draft a rb don’t let dak throw too much he’s the worst 40 mil qb of all time.
People was about to anoint Dallas after beating a team with no name 🤣.
With how bad cowboys played this game, still bringing it to a 3 point game with that bubble for huge yardage, it shows view good the roster is this year. Super excited for playoffs
AZ thank you for giving me Cowboy trolling material for Facebook, lol!
Dallas scored too many points last week they were fat and happy. Same old Cowbillies. They will be one and done! Have not won anything in 24 years! BTW, Dallas ripped off the college all star team's uniforms from the 60's.
Crazy as it sounds , after beating the brakes off of Washington a back to reality loss to a playoff team may be just the ticket for the Cowboys . The fact that they were on a four game win streak means they would have to have won 9 in a row to win it all which was an unrealistic goal .
Yes 😁
Watching this condense version of the game, I can only surmise that Dak Prescott isn't accurate and his arm talent is horrible. Good luck in the playoffs!
1 and done in the Playoffs, DaLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLas IS A JOKE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT SKIP HAS TO SAY HIIHIIHIIII!!!!! (Uncle Shay)
Defense if u say anything else u don't know Football all on defense and coaching sad Defense is a joke .
Yeap, i think The Cards were actually hot!! Dallas defense was doing pretty good considering this team. The Cards started wearing them out on the field. This why i said before, defence can help you but for so far. You need some offence!! Yeap, one and done as they say!! Ive always said this, and im a Die hard Dallas fan since a child!! Dak will not ever carry us there!! We trailed that whole game!! Over throws, under throws, fumbles, cant run for a first down!! And we got pretty much all our weapons in this game!! I would hope Dallas's win over a sorry team would momentumly carry through nope, not the case!! You can take your over paid quarterback and your sorry tail kicker to the trash dump as far as in concern!!! Dak just dont have it!! You know when you have a something special about a quarterback? Ive never seen that in Dak yet!!! There would just be something about him!!  A smart gifted quarterback!! Yall know what i mean!!
Really wanna rematch
When the cowgirls play a REAL team they crumble.  Prediction: Cowgirls lose the first round of playoffs.
I see a lot of ragging on the cowboys for the game but truthfully after watching several times I don’t think they played that bad. I think both teams played pretty equally tbh just cardinals came out on top. Neither of these teams look like super ball teams imo
damn bro, only if kyler was our qb, we would be unstoppable, corners got a little exposed out but defense was a beast as they have been this entire season, dak is trash, ive been saying it since   his second season was over (2018), wide open miss-throws, slow release, poor decision making, cant read defenses, this match was a perfect example of what does a versatile qb can make for your team and how deep and extended an offensive playbook can be, kellen moore choking again, im really worried about playoffs but tbh i wouldn't be surprised if it ends up as usual. Also we have literally the worst kicker of the league, already compromised two games of this season.
CARDINALS WANTED IT MORE THEN DALLAS
Cowboys keep showing that they can be good but not great. They've been doing it for 25 years. It's almost as if the common thread was poor overall team management.   Another poor playoff showing on the way? Seems likely. And, if so, isn't it likely that the 2022 season will follow the same arc? That the momentum of the Dak era will be on the downslope going forward? This just isn't an organization capable of managing and capitalizing on moderate success. They just can't turn that into championships. Their 25 year record is who they are.
Dallas at its best probably pass wild card round.
Adversity. That’s the Cowboys biggest weakness. Everything has to go perfect for them to prosper. As soon as something goes wrong the whole team folds under pressure. Been this way for years. Soon as they gotta overcome any adversity they crumble.
CLEARLY THEY CHEATED.. I can show you when, where, and How..🤔🤔
My first season watching NFL. Dallas is one of my teams as Texas is one of the two states I hope to move to one day. Dallas’ defence is like a sieve and they seem to win when their offence plays better than the opponents’ since the defence doesn’t seem to be able to stop good teams doing what they want.
Uh-oh Skip! I don't think he will be slamming those papers down tomorrow saying "How bout them cowboys" lol
Y'all Ina comments talking about I'm a cowboys fan but I knew the Cardinals would win no tf y'all didn't most of y'all expected the cowboys to comeback and win 😂
DALLAS NOT A PLAYOFF WINNING TEAM, SAME OLE STORY, BOUNCED IN THE FIRST/SECOND ROUND/UNDISCIPLINED IN THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS, JIMMY MUST BE BITING HIS LIPS OFF, POOR PERFORMANCE, WHY IS FOURTH QUARTER GO TIME, HELL MAKE THE  WHOLE GAME GO TIME, B READY FOR MORE DISAPPOINTMENT FANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DAK has won nothing. Every time he faces top competition he plays poor. Never will win anything.
Best ending to a cowboys  game  EVER‼️🤣🤣❤
Run the clock out like democrats:)
America's team??  Cowpies lost to Mini Mouse. Big D fans were are u?
Bullshit we are not gonna win a playoff game playing like that. Especially against  Arizona. That shouldve been a sweep
The cowboys can't win big games and they can't beat the top teams. Sorry for us cowboys fans but, it's gonna be another one of those endings.
📢 Colts fan here, i really like the cardinals qb.. 🏈
Dallas got exposed!
Let me tell yall what's really happened??Arizona ran a 2min 3rd down fastbreak offense the whole game?basically shotgun offense atleast 80percent of the game ?Dallas should have ran their up tempo offense more they didn't?missed fieldgoal. Dropped passes?bad 3rd down defense and offense and that's the end of Dat?
There's a point where the defense stop holding it back when these QBs starts running
Murray so small he looks like so fast running around with giants
They just not a fourth quarter team
Stop complaining against the referee you Dallas f-er had multiple PI calls in late 2nd quarter and still lose the game, both team have unclear penalties stop whining
4:00 idk why Wilson getting mad about a DPI. He didn’t even try to find the ball and tackle the receiver before the ball got there. 😂
That fumble tho Dak smfh
Dallas didnt play that bad. They play again Dallas scores 40+. Because the team is inconsistent.
That 3rd quarter smfh
Can't score no worries the refs got u cowboys
Prescott played like muppet.
The cowboys waited to the 4th quarter to not suck
Zeke lost yardage.....what else is new
I'm starting 2 feel bad 4 Dallas defense. They gotta b exhausted from all them quick 3 & outs
Preskot sucks
Cowgirls offense let a depleted cardinals defense outshine them and let a team beat you that are without Hopkins and Conner and was on a multiple game losing streak.. Y'all deserve to lose 😩🤣
Preskot says we arent in a slump I just miss wide open recievers.
Cowboys offensive line is a problem. It's lack of performance has taken away their running threat.  I'm a bigger cowboy fan than any, but without a good front line, we will be watching the Superbowl.  Putting some hogs on the front line should be Jerry's priority.  Leave everything else as is..well maybe get rid of the wolf hunter.
Stop trying to make Zeke happen, Dallas. You messed up, move on. Also, anyone remember when Kyler was too short to play in the NFL? 🤣
# MAMA DON'T LET YOUR BABY BE COWBOYS FAN ?
The real play of the game was on special team when murrsy and prater were both out there dallas calls timeout so couldnt stop the clock anymore that was huge
The cowboys suck one and done maybe next year
People underestimate the little things to win a game and special teams. Prater dudbt have his holder last few games we did fake punt washington nails cowboys returner cowboys missed f.g . its the little intangibles. But we have a great special teams squad . simmons most underrated lb in nfl but hes the biggest hitter in nfl
$75M might as well be $7M... cause that's all Dak's worth... whatever intangible Brady has that makes him win... Dak lacks...
I'm a diehard Dallas Cowboys this team with all the talent they have on both offence and defence just can not beat teams with a winning record.we have to beat the Eagles week for some kind of momentum going into the playoffs..it's now or never or we wait another 26 yrs
Must be nice to have a kicker that can make field goals
Shoutout to Cards Defense! They nasty
Could it be any more obvious  when Dallas all of a sudden can't do anything and then penalty, penalty,  penalty? Even with help the cowboys lost
The problem with the cowboys to me is that they say dumb stuff too much. Its starts with the owner and trickles down. "Statement game"??? Give me a break
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!
Cowboys letting me down again,go figure.Getting really tired of this!
Yeah Boy!!
The announcers sound so depressed after their Cowboys lost, lol.
The Cowboys can beat teams like Washington and NY but have trouble against teams like Az uummh ! Interesting.
Dak not a top tier QB whatsoever, mediocre at best.  Not cool and calm, plays scared.
Dallas hasn’t beaten an above .500 team all season let that sink in. When they face an above .500 team , they lose.
i love how they started playing good in the fourth quarter😂😂
Statement game? What's the statement?
Dak doing too much
GO CARDINALS
Dallas should get AB if he is available 💯
Arizona needs to get on the call with rosen and bring him back
why is Dak trying to spin his way out of tackles? you would think after he fumbled he would learn but he does the next drive lmao
That pass interference was hot garbage the one that got intercepted. Followed by another one. Jones check cashed on that drive
Dallas Cowboys of Arlington Tx are once again over rated.
As a non cowboys fan. I’m glad they lost. Now I don’t have to see all them “We tHeM bOyZ” posts on my feed. Thank you Cardinals
Where’s the run game
Its just so funny how we can play so good the week before but once we play a good team its like they don't even wanna be there or the play calls and players always fold lol
This is the catch of the year but listen those quite announcer …
Dallas is NOT a Superbowl team. Pitiful!
On their way to year 26 without a playoff win 👍🏽👍🏽🙌🏽
Losers lol
Cowboys do this every season, start Super Bowl bound strong and then start fizzling out. Will there be a pleasant surprise this year?
#Fans Cowboygirl really suck at playing and idiot #cryfansdallas/cowboygirl
Its like the cowboys are trying to lose 😂😂👊🏾👊🏾😎
Dem Cowpokes got a beating by some birdies. 😳
Like I said before: Cowboys are a Hype job! They FINALLY played somebody with a winning record, & this is who they are, a great regular season team😂
Still trying to figure out why parsons wasn’t back in the middle spying on Murray because he was get 10 yards a carry and the last procession.
That was Fumble and Dallas did not Challenge!!! Wow!
that Defense kept this game from become a blowout, but if this was Mahomes or Rodgers, Dallas would be in big trouble
Anybody see that sad sore looser ass handshake McCarthy gave Arizona's coach at the end? What a looser this dude is lmfaooo
Kingsbury is a gutless wimp. Rather then settle for field goals , maybe go for it on fourth down ever now and then. Fields goals ain't going to do it in the playoffs.
Who else thinks that that play at 2:52 in the 4th quarter was a fumble :(( unfortunately Dallas couldn’t challenge
Why call the last timeout for something stupid
Love when the cowboys lose
😂😂🤣 Cowboys not going to make any noise in the playoffs, they only look good when they are playing their own trash division 🤣
Refs trying to give it to Dallas again huh
If Cowboys blew the other squad again, we might of had romantic kissing between Dak and Zeke this time. Just in case yall missed it Dak and Zeke kissed last week.
You are alright against. Washington? Giants? And Eagles? ...
Put some respect on Budda Baker name !!
How about Wesley stepping up in place of Hopkins
Even with it being a bad game and the Cards without their best WR it was such a close game. The usual bad calls here and there but definitely a nail biter
Qbs should learn to throw with both hands it will be a great advantage scrambling to the left or right to a open WR across their body
Dallas O-Line is hit or miss, leading to nearly 0 pocket time for Dak, creating slow starts with the pass game and we neglect the running when this happens generally..so it’s a dead first half..our defense was very stagnant overall this game..this is our “trend” with Playoff and or Super Bowl caliber teams 😒
After reading these comments it seems to me cowboys fans have exactly the same attitude as the cowboys team.  Very negative when things aren't going well.  But super positive when they are going well.  They will lose to tough teams but slaughter weak teams.  Maybe you all need an attitude change because this team is talented.  Dak has not always been great but he is good and has fight in him.  He makes comebacks sometimes and is hard to stop when hot.  I am not a cowboys fan.  I do think they are really good.  My opinion on this NFC playoff this year is that no matter who makes it to the superbowl, it will be a tough thing to do.  And I think it will take some things to go a teams way.  Hopefully officials stay out of it.  But postseason is insanely deep.  To me there are six teams that have a chance.  I do think some better than others but all six good legitimately do it
Cowboys since the Cradle here, I say it right after the Cheat-triots, and Denver Fiasco and caught so much mmmm negative reactions from the so-called Dallas Fans to put it nicely, three players that do not help and in my humble opinion must get rid of. Anthony brown, Greg Zuerlein and prescott. yup I said it he can't throw deep, misses wide open WR his decision making is too slow even a simple pass of less than 10 yards and he keeps missing the WR, gives a way half of game or enters too cold or too late into the game and when we play a decent team he's nowhere to be found with multiple 3 and outs, is going to be painful during the playoffs  and will not be surprised if we don't even make it beyond the wild card game..
We just got a look at the playoffs today and it says the cowboys still suck,  and yes I'm a cowboys fan 😒
Oof. Those two pi calls against the cards that allowed the cowboys to score a td looked dubious. But I didn't get to see the replay.
"they can't beat winning teams, they are one and done lol" whatever. Pats Chargers and eagles all have winning records and we beat them. Cards played a great game and we played scared on offense most the game. See y'all again in 2 weeks for revenge.  Also that was definitely a fumble at the end and your just hating if you say otherwise.
The Cardinals had the better kicker and that was the ball game
Da(L)(L)*AZž 🥴💩🤡
Sorry ass cowboys 🤠
What a joke of a team so much talent just to beat bad teams and lose to good ones. Proves that coaching is key
Dallas is a waste of talent lol
Love it
The Cowboys still haven`t beaten a team with a winning record this year, and I don`t see them doing well in the post season.
Every team that has beat Dallas plays like a unit not a team. This is how great football teams play and win championships. Dallas needs to learn to do this, play as a unit. Individuality will not get you to the Superbowl my friends.
WHY IS NOONE ACTING LIKE THAT WAS'NT A FUMBLE WITH 2:38 LEFT IN THE GAME... EVEN THOUGH WE DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE TIMEOUTS LEFT, I HAVE SEEN OTHER COACHES CALL 1 AND THEY ACTUALLY CHALLENGED THE PLAY... THE NFL NEED OTHER PEOPLE WATCHING THE GAMES TO MAKE THESE CALLS, LIKE  WHEN THEY WOULD SOMETIMES ASK MIKE PEREIRA, WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE CALL. THEY NEED SOMEONE EITHER TO MONITOR EACH GAME OR SOME KIND OF WAY TO BE A JUDGE AND OVERRULE PLAYS LIKE THIS.. IF THEY GET THIS CALL CORRECT, WE HAVE A CHANGE TO WIN OR AT LEAST GO IN OT.
Go Cards!!!!!
Skip: moral victory!!
Murray is great!
I'm a WFT fan and this is the second game I bet against Dallas and won. 😎👍👍👍
The refs saved cardinals
Az should have really destroyed dallas this game
Cowboys are terrible
told ya dallas pissing in the wind no sb..
Hi I'm Aaron rodgers wanna play? Hehehehehhe
Wish they counted the fumble towards the end. Wanted to see if they could win it or make it to O.T at least. Good game
I knew we would lose this game all week. We dont commit to the run, had no balance, cant get coop involved. Didnt use our fast pace like last week. Got going too late. Zuerlein again w his misses. Just a bad game plan.   But he stays in bounds fumbles, refs blow the call, we get no booth review, no NY, no nothing. Time out or challenge flag or not, nfl has been doing that all year. Reviewing crucial calls. Typical.
As a dallas fan it pains me how much talent we have but the half the time we dont use it cough cough amari cooper 3 receptions 18 yards
I hate to say it because Dak Prescott is a first class individual but no one player is worth the money they are paying him. Not even Brady or Mahomes or anyone.  It's too much pressure on the young man to be great, because good is not gonna be good enough.  We saw it with Russell Wilson in Seattle when they made him the highest paid player ever and then the team wen't into a slowdive and now their in the cellar, and watch, Dallas won't win either unless Dak can carry the team and throw for 5,000 yards and 50 TDs and I don't see that happening.
it was not a fumble by Edmunds.   watch the slow mo.
Antoine Wesley stepping up big time, when they needed it. Cardinals defensive coverage was spot on. Looked like a super bowl contender again.
Great for the win hope to see you one of you at Lambeau in the Playoff.
Most dramatic fans ever in this comment section. We win last week and everyone says we’re the leagues best, we have a bad week this week losing  by 3 to an 11-5 team and everyone saying we’re guaranteed to fall flat in the first round of the playoffs. Take it one week at a time folks. Cowboys never had any shot of lifting the  lombardi today even if we won 100-0.
Down goes the Cowboys
I've never seen an official point and scream so emphatically that he was right just to be devastatingly wrong on that late fumble. Just ready to go home.
The dallas offense lost it for them
Cowgirls can’t beat good teams
Tried to tell people something is wrong with Dak the second half of the season…Cowboys screw-in themselves over and headed to 1 and done unless they get a weak Wildcard team like saints or maybe Eagles…
Funny how last week Dallas beats a team That has 20 players out and they are going to the Super Bowl . This week they  are sipping  from the STFU Cup again
that was a fumble at the end. but oh wel. nothing will change until human refs are removed.
I just don't see us winning a playoff game, it's something going on with Dak and the boys, once again you get paid than you become worse, Zek, useless, not worth a fart, dak not worth a fart against good teams, kicker should have got rid of him early in regular season, and on and on, more talent than I seen in years, I just don't get it.
These older than dirt refs gotta go.....
Zeke needa get benched
Dallas offense can not handle  pressure..
Need I remind everyone, Murray won 4 state championships on this same field  was basically a home game for him EASY
If only Philly would of beat the damn Giants and Niners in Week 2. Next week would of had more meaning
Cardinal without, JJ Watt, without Corner and D-Hop and the Cowboys still lost.  this could have been a huge blowout if Hopkin and Corner were playing.
When I grow up I’m going to be a football player and I’m going to be on the Eagles team
Dallas still couldn't win with the refs giving them bogus calls 😒 lol 😆 Dallas should sign AB they need some help
Nothing to see here.Arizona will lose to Seattle and be right back to being mediocre.
I swear I’m not superstitious but every f??c king time we where that jersey we do not win sh$$$$$$&
That 3rd and 9 to Green should have been a bomb instead he had to slow down to catch it that shouldn't happen how does AJ catch all these crazy catches 😳 he is a big pick up for us
The penalties helped
Same old Cowboys.
Go Pack Go 🤠
That catch by ward should be catch of the year
Cowboys take that L! They thought it was an easy W 😂
How bout them cowboys!!🤣😂
When you make dak go through his progressions on pass plays he struggles unless the first read is open.
JUST IGNORE THE FUMBLE I GUESS
Cowboys beat themselves with penalties, meaningless game for us and we lost Gallup. Antonio Browns a free agent now though 🤔😂
I don't care that we lost this game.  I am proud of my team !! For them to come back and nearly win by putting up 15 points in the 4th quarter shows alot about Dallas!! Good game guys. !! Dc4l!!
The last play before the cards take knees was a fumble, should have been cowboy ball. What a shame.
Another game lost that could have went to o.t cause of our lovely kicker.
Dallas can’t be good teams. Maybe next year but not this year. Rooting for ARod to win the chip this year.
One and done playoff game. Better luck next year. With a kicker who is not consistent and a defense who can't stop the run.
The Cowboys have so many superstars on a shitty team. One and done again.
Cardinals were meant to win this game. And you can absolutely see it in the last 2 minutes. If not, you're blind
how bout dem cowgirls lolol.
McCarthy should have cut the kicker long ago. Again  he cost us another game
Die hard Cowboys fan and very disappointed. Wanted another complete performance from my team but yet again the Cowboys find a way to lose contested games against playoff caliber opponents regardless refs sucking ass... No Complimentary football no championship same ol bull$ rather it be rigged or not I'm about done with this sopopera... it's always same. ❤ can't take much more of the mediocre. All else aside umm officials? I mean shouldn't we review a game changing fumble recovery with the WHOLE FkN Game on the line?? Just saying 🤔🧐🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
As a lifelong cowboys fan it’s just sad that even when they have a good season they’re still trash every cowboys fan knows never get their hopes up for anything significant because they will choke when it matters
About 4 days ago when majority & practically 99% of ESPN (10 analyst) was picking the Cowboys to beat the Cards besides one. Had a feeling the Cards are goin’ for broke in this game since they already had lost 3 straight, coupled that w/ Murray not having his #1 receiver in Hopkins, even though the ‘Boys have all the firepower (O & D), that this game isn’t gonna be a cakewalk & the Cards would fight & claw their way & would squeak out a much needed Big Fat W……Lo & behold.  Yup! I guess DJ (Daniel Jeremiah) was the shepherd & the 9 decided to play sheep 😂 ……Happy 2K22 Y’all! 🙏🏼
The boys struggled today but damn, those officials were only calling holding penalties on us when Dlaw and Micah were being held all game long smh
I like how he didnt throw the flag until the pick happened. Way to make it obvious...
My boy diggs gets torched every game lol. And casshies think his ints make up for it 😂😂😂
Cowboys will not make it past one playoff game coming from a cowboy fan
Boyz musta partied a Lil too much.
So no one is gonna talk about that fumble?
As a Seahawks fan: ABC ANYONE BUT the COWBOYS!!! :D
Dallas only can shine on a Washington Football Team who had 3rd stringers in the game😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
That helmet catch was amazing 🤯🤯
Cowboys are 11-5 idgaf no one can't take that away from us there are worse teams then the cowboys. A lot of teams haven't been great this year. We'll beat the eagles next week and see what will happen in playoffs. I feel a lot of upsets coming.
So once again the Cowgirls dish out some heartbreak to their fans. So are you still talking " Superbowl Contender"?
Cry fans Dallas🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro week 6 2020 highlights look oddly similar to today's 😬😬😬😬
Cardinals won with the referee's help, holdings, fumbles unnecesary roughness; all the NFL  referees corp have a very poor level.
Cowboys looking anemic out there.
Dak isn't good enough to win games himself. As long as he's QB the Cowboys will never win anything more than a couple playoff games. He can't only be good when everything is working around him. Not a bad qb but highly overrated
For a team that can look so good they can't stay consistent and in the playoffs that's a big problem. McCarthy doesn't know how to use timeouts which killed them in the end but the excuse that's what cost them the game takes away from doing nothing in the beginning of the game. The run game is lacking and as much as we can blame the refs for not calling that a fumble which it was what about the other 50 plus minutes. Dallas just keeps beating themselves and if everything stays the same instead if the eagles they will probably end up playing the cardinals again in 2 weeks.
First round exit for dallas per usual.
I've been seeing across an the hate for Dak. The is fighting and fighting every play. But when Dak fights and fumbles or throws a pick, he sucks. Romo was NOTORIOUS for fighting and fumbling and throwing picks. But Romo is awesome, heroic, doing it by himself! This fukn fan base makes me sick to my stomach.
Cowboys suck they haven't beaten anyone of significance this year
Prescott is not a top 10 QB, he's good but not great and it shows.
I don't belive that garbage team like dallas have 11 wins?
Ah yes the cowboys are the most confusing team right now in the nfl
The cardinals dline complain they get held every week and flop around begging for the refs to call holding. This week the refs caved into all the flopping the only reason the cardinals won.
6:08 For a second, I thought they added fire effects on the football.
When Dallas & Alabama LOSES the WORLD wins!!!
That win last week looks flukish now. The mediocre form has returned, when playing a quality defense the O is anemic and Dak is inaccurate. All playoff teams here on out, not lookin good
#letsgojerry
#1 offense in the NFL my ass lmao, maybe when playing Washington.
Clock Management
Cowboys had to play against the Cards and the Refs like they do every dam week because Goodell and the NFL hates the Cowboys. Rodgers, Brady, and Maholmes get a ton of breaks and favortism from the refs but teams like Dallas have to overcome bad officiating.
Dak making too many mistakes. Kid just needs to breathe.
joe buck stinks
As a Packers fan, I have some advice for Cowboys fans: fire Mike McCarthy ASAP. He will only take you so far.
The NFC playoffs is going to be ridiculously tough. The team that makes it is going to be worn down. The AFC has much easier path.
Both teams now 11-5. Skip will be interesting to watch after this loss.
Traveling to Dallas for the game. Got plenty of hate… idk what it is when peeps are too confident but turn out to be foolish, wether you win or lose respect your opponent
So hows them cowgirls
can we all sign a petition to get the those screen passes out of the playbook?
The only statement made by Dallas was "we can't win against Good teams. We need to beat injured teams with losing records to feel confident" 🤣🤣🤣
It's choking time for the cowgirls
Btw get a new kicker cost us different scenarios for this game and many others thru the season
Murray is REALLY good
I love watching the Cowpies lose.
It's so beautiful  when cowboys lose and even better in playoffs  when they lose which they will
I’m glad we lost….in two weeks we have to play them again at home first playoff game lesson learned now kick the $hit out of Philly or I don’t think we have a good chance second time around !!!!
I don't know why is this a surprise. It wasn't a surprise to me. I picked Arizona to beat the cowboys 26-20 cowboys haven't beat a winning team. Yes. When they play a real bad team they win big. How bout them Cardinals!!!!
HOW BOUT THEM DALLAS COWHOES 😆😆😆😆😆
That TD catch by WESLEY GAAHHLLYY
Cowboys getting into their playoff form.
This will be a statement game, huh Micah?
#9 Arz Play of the game!  Simmons strip Dak. Dallas will have trouble ahead, no running game. AZ still a good team.
...an elite Q.B doesn't lose games with the offense lineup the cowboys have and the way the defense is playing...dak is just an average Q.B he wont get the cowboys to the Superbowl...he's nit in a slump he's nit that good...3 or 4 good receivers 2 good runningbacks 2 good tightends but one is injured...good offenseive line...i think dak needs a little competition at Q.B he's not trying hard enough...
Dak can’t beat good teams. He’s good just not good enoughz
Dallas looks good beating up on trash teams but 0-2 against playoff teams foolz gold. They are who we thought they if u wanna crown their ass then crown em lol
Porqué este idiota no juega con sus corredores?
Go pack go
I stopped watching this game early in the 3rd quarter. I saw the refs were once again up to their old tricks and the Cowboys were going to get screwed. Somebody needs to find the stats on penalties called on the Packers when McCarthy was coaching them. I don’t believe any of those Packers teams led the league in penalties. Now McCarthy is coaching the Cowboys and they get the most costly penalties at the most crucial moments. Now McCarthy coaches the Cowboys and they lead the league in penalties? Somebody please look into this and explain what has changed? The same coach would have the same coaching methods correct? The league has it out for the Cowboys and loved the Packers.
It seams as if every good team we play the kicker had something to do with it. Vs Tampa we lost by a point when our kicker missed like 2 field goals. Same for this game where we could have tied the game. And if kearse gets that interception they don’t get those 3 points from their field goal. Respect to parsons though with all those qb pressures today
if the refs would not have botched 2 obvious calls in one play, the boys would have scored and won. way to go refs yet again, keep up the great work. imagine if this was a playoff game you hacks
It’s the cowboys come on now
McCarthy going 👇
Whata joke!! And that is why i dont watch cowboys games anymore.
Skip on suicide watch
Am I the only one who days depend on how these dudes perform🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️it’s so hard being a cowboys fan DC4l💙
Why hasn’t someone on the sideline just gone up to Dak and be honest with him? “You’re not that guy, pal, you’re not that guy.”
"What CAN go wrong, WILL go wrong!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How about them Packers?
Refs did everything they could to get Dallas in the End Zone before the end of the first half 😂🤣
I heard Skip is crying in the crib with Ernestine right now.
Murry makes Prescott look below average.
At least Dak gets paid like an elite QB.
Dallas embarrassed the wft team and was all laughs well today they got punched in the mouth. Just shows what we all knew from the start, they will lose the 1st round playoff game.
When u can do what u did last week then turn around and come out flat we just shoot ourselves in the foot everytime like in the Denver game just make no sense
Cheats ain't help
Looks like somebody beat the Washington team and thought that meant they were goi'n to the Super Bowl!
Dallas Cowgirls playing like cheerleaders 📣 out there 😂😂😂
Congrats cards...... Road 🛣️ to the Superbowl goes through the frozen tundra baby!!!!! 🌨️❄️🧀🌨️❄️           🏆
YO WHY ARENT WE TALKING ABOUT THAT CATCH ON THE FAKE PUNT
The key to a SB is seeding and home playoff games.  A bye is King.  We may not have none of that come playoffs. That means our $$ QB & RB$$ must be on Point throughout the playoff matchups on the road. It's possible but somewhat of a nightmaric road to LA. Kicking FG is what most playoff games come down to.  Long FG in most situations. Let's Focus on that and make all of them. Dak should never run the ball through the middle again. CeeDee should only go forward when targeted for passes. The defense must be ready for Rodgers #12. He will test our readiness. Let's  stay covid free!
"What offensive slump," they said. How about THIS ONE.
Yessir!! It's refreshing to see a Dallas loss. They were on their high horses from beating injured teams and teams that were .500 and under. Welcome to the big league, fellas. It's a whole new ball game when u play higher caliber teams. And Arizona still had some starters missing. Just a preview of the playoffs for u guys. Thank u Arizona. I wish u could've put em down a little sooner, but y'all still got it done 😆😆😆💪🏽 Can't wait to hear Shannon and Stephen A Smith tmrw 😁
It was only a 3 point loss with all those holding penalties killing drives that were moving the ball, all the big plays made by the cards, missed kick, and bad throws. Think cowboys should be pretty content getting a rematch in two weeks.
That time out made a huge difference. Cowboys couldn't challenge at the end.
https://youtu.be/jAgiRIru1Sk
Again and Again above .500 team and Dak pees on himself. So much for DOOMSDAY Defense #3. SMH disappointed again.
BIRD GANG!!!
I thought pi didn't exist on punt plays?
So the cowboys are like the kid who gets a trophy without ever proving anything.   Fire the GM and you’ll get your trophy,,,, or continue to make Jerry more money.
As a Cowboys fan I just know we are gonna choke against good teams this should have been expected for most decent game though
As a packer fan...😆😂🤣   That's all!
Dallas AB > "soon to be no longer Bucs" AB
Cards Offensive line got healthy
Dallas loses...2022 off to a good start!
If McCarthy had better managed the timeouts we would have had a timeout to challenge the no call on the fumble. It was clearly a fumble.
If I'm Dallas Head Coach I'm concerned  very concerned!!
Green bay or cowboys? be honest
Cardinals bounced back and could still win the West
Good job, Cards.  It’s nice to see an example of exactly what’s gonna happen to the arrogant ass Bitchboys in the playoffs.  I hate Dallas, and their stuck-up, lardass fans so much I can taste it.
It's simple. No one has ever won a SB with a high priced RB. NEVER. Get rid of Zek. Pollard is enough.
Thanks Cards for once, we're now 2nd place! ~Rams fan
How bout them 🐄  👧 🤣
Dallas put up 50 pts last week on Washington but couldn't put half of that today. Overhype ass Dallas. They cannot win against playoff teams. One and done
As a packers fan I thank the cardinals for giving us the #1 seed
Dallas vs the refs he didnt fumble
As a cardinals fan this is a huge relief 😅
We seem to fall to winning teams and we out here looking like we are pretenders in the playoffs
It is obvious that the NFL loves the Cowboys, For a while it seemed like with Dirty Plays and bad calls they Cowboys would win. Yes their Owner made a deal with the devil so let him deal with it.  NO super Bowl for the cowboys
Go Cardinals👍🏻❤️
Cowgirls run put of gas every game
Cowboys can make the divisional game most likely gonna play eagles now or cardinals again if it’s AZ maybe not making it but just saying
Once again the refugees made the Dallas Cowboy's lose.
The Cardinals defensive front four played great. Enjoyed how they controlled the line of scrimmage. Had three to four lineman going after Dak when he decided to run.  Cowboys scored easy when they were near the goal.
as a cardinals fan I expected the cardinals to lose even when they were up 22  7 I though the cowboys would come back and win
Because of the Cardinals, I won 200$ bucks.
The Cowboys looked out of sync on offense in the first half. Dak was a bit off with his timing, but also, Cardinals blocked a lot of passes at the line.
This is terrible this is the game that you had to have!!!!!! The cowboys are not super bowl contenders from a cowboy fan. You cannot lose football games like this at home COME ON MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, we know Dallas will be 1 and done yet again.
Kyler still unbeaten in his entire career of football at AT&T Stadium👌🏾
Cardinals play the Cowboys agin in the playoff. so get ready
As a cowboys fan in the back of my mind I hope that they play bad on these games that aren't necessarily needed wins but probably not lol
My dad-in-law loves Cardinals he might be proud of being a Cardinals fan...
Dak is so garbage he is not accurate and he hesitates way to much one what he’s going to do on his passes
4:30 that ain't even fair how Murray did that 😯🤣
Damn Jerry’s goons didn’t get paid what they wanted 😎👑🎊🦅☝️🎄
Feel like the cowboys got cheated out of this win
I'm not surprised by this outcome, as Cowboys fan, people need to understand, that this a new system for these young players, change comes slow, people expect fast results, but it just doesn't happen overnight, be happy with just having a winning season...
Its funny really just when cardinals were about to make a touchdown. Cowboys make a false start. And cardinals end up getting penalized for something they did not commit. Shows how cowboys are a fruad team.    Still got your ass handed by cardinals and cowboys have to play dishonest football. Just to show cowboys can only beat weak teams and they fall apart when they play against strong teams. Stay losers cowboys you have been exposed as america fake team and still going 26 years later.
No one wants to hear this but Prescott lost this game with those 2 fumbles because he’s horrible at scrambling.  With that said, they had one of the best seasons and comebacks in almost franchise history.
Coopers touchdown wasn't even a touchdown he was out of bounce 🖕
As long as Roger Goodell is commissioner,  Dallas will never get the favorable .
Biggest plays of the game, missed field goal and dropped interception in the end zone
Cowboys suck McCarthy worst coach ever Dak can’t win the big one, I think that covers it. All aboard, plenty of space just became available on the Cowboy bandwagon.
Those PI calls in the first half to get Dallas in the endzone were BS!
Cowboys Need a new LG C and K, would be 14-2 with a good kicker
terrible call by refs with 2 mins left cost the cowboys the game
Say what you say play calling by the coach. The referees are against us. Or this game really didn’t matter. Those Cowboys will not let you down just wait it’s coming every year something happens and bam 💥 out of the playoffs... can’t wait for first take...
Bird Gang baby 🤣🤣👏👏
When the cowboys plays a good D ..of course they gonna have a slow start..everyone get all hype because they blow out a 6-9 team. I don’t ..they lucky hopkins is out..aj green and Wesley giving them Dallas dbacks the work..cowboys only gonna win a bowl if the ref help them ..other then that they gonna get knock out their first playoff game if they don’t get calls from the ref
Dak sucks
Can’t wait to see them again
I was worried they were gonna pound the ball on ground, then remembered it's Dallas and they don't like to work zeke...
Thanks cowboys the packers just took the number 1 seed and gave us an extra bye week. 3 weeks to get some guys back and make that run :)
Ugh
Prater was the mvp
got beat by a team that lost to the lions sucks to suck
Anytime the 🤠cowgirls lose, makes my Sunday💪
Why in tf is no one talking about that catch on the fake punt? Geez.
From the hawks fan , this year is the cardinals year and I hoping they will make it to the Superbowl and win.
Diggs can't handle aj green 😈
13:35 knees down
How do refs miss delay of game and a fumble same play  in the final minutes 😂
Woops, what happened here! Down in Dallas during the Staubach erea. And I'm a Cards fan. Win, Win. To bad Broncos took another one on the chin. Ouch.
Prescott’s fumble geeeez that was their chance
Go Arizona
there was a fumble
Let’s face it, though, the Cardinals have owned DallAss for years and years. DallAss is much improved, but once again, Arizona takes it. It’s not even really surprising anymore.
Zurvline missed that fG
Kyler Murray =special Ed kid  -Dallas fan
Cant wait to see Skip and Shannon Show.  Skip thought Cowboys were just getting started from last week... The salt is going to be great Also Packers beating Vikings easy. Hes not going to be happy apart from Bradys win
Dem Boyz 😂😂😂
Penalties killed the Cowboys once again
Dallas lost to a good team. Not surprised by that.
Been a Dallas fan since 92 now I’m moving over to basketball ✌️
Cowboys going to the Superbowl and will win it
hahahaha, the cowbums.......
Troy aikman that satanist was so sad awww cowboy jock strapper
Kellen Moore and Dan Quinn can forget about their interviews for a Head Coaching Job. I wouldn't Hire neither of them after their personnel put on a Poor and Pathetic performance like that.  The Cowboys are like that Bully that picks on kids they can beat up! When another Bully show up, they run and hide. Tuck their tails between their legs and run to the corner hoping they got away, with piss running down their legs. Scared, trembling and shaking like a dog trying to sh*t razor blades. That's who the Cowboys are.
Don’t know why we stopped running the ball yeah it was a two score game but the game was never crazy out of reach,Dallas offense of line is not been looking too good these days Martin Smith or pass their primes too many holding calls Connor Williams aside
Cowboys once again robbed a win GG refs!!!
One and done in the playoffs that’s the Cowboys easy to beat up on the weak they never step up in the big game. 😑
And for Gods sake..cut Anthony Brown
Would be nice if LvE started playing BIG  like he is. Big man. So tired of him plying soft.  Dcb ain't going to do nuttin just like last 25 years.  U got them big linemen why not soften them corners up and pull the guards and smash them corners up then start running pa, and go verticals .  The defense seem to nice .
Kellen Moore gotta trust Dak and let him get them playmakers involved when we start slow. Cooper..Lamb..Wilson..Shultz..Pollard..Zeke. That’s alotta talent. We shouldn’t have lost this game 😡
Wow... when Murray is committed to running the ball, the cardinals are exceptionally dangerous.....! Not even a fan of cardinals, but Murray is a very entertaining QB to watch.
at that 5:30-6:00 I saw the refs hand dallas that drive there was no pass interference on either one of those plays wtf lmao
Yup after this game I have no faith in Dallas even as a fan I already know they're going to be eliminated first round of the playoffs smh
Start cedric wilson at qb...come on dak man fk!!!!!!!
The announcers for this game were horrible and made watching the game extremely difficult.. You would never have guessed that the Cardinals were in the building and it was just a freakin travesty listening to these 2 Buffoon's talk about Dallas for 3 hours.. I am not a fan of either team but literally find a few guys to call a game without a dog in the race.. smh  --
With Green Bay dominating tonight and guaranteeing the top seed, Dallas has to hope that they win next week in Philly and that both the Rams and Bucs lose to get the two seed.
how is that a pass interference at 5:33 he was turned around looking at the ball, swatted it away
And we didn't have to fly in our own benches. Beat yall with your own benches 😂😂😂
Hey Dallas fans, I thought Diggs is the best corner in the league? If he was he wouldn't allow old man Green to get 74 yards.
I hate the Cowboys almost as much as I hate the Seachickens about half as much as I hate the Green Bay Peckers, which is the same as I hate the San Francisco Fruity whiners. GO ARIZONA! You are going to win it all this Season
Dallas fans claiming we paid off the refs yet all the calls I seen favored Dallas more than it did az.
That was a fumble. Mistakes were made by the cowboys big time but hopefully film will change that.
Cowboys got cheated in this game multiple times
The cowboys haven’t beaten any NFC winning teams so far.  They’re first round playoffs exit.
Everything is a penalty, nobody knows what a catch/fumble is anymore, and you get penalized for smacked the QB in the head with your hand while going after their arm… which is right next to their head…
oh yeah...our QB is too small...we cant possibly win....who seen AJ Green schoolin Diggs?....too funny!!
That was a fumble
Good job, your refs on the field, AND the ones who are watching and it’s THEIR JOB to buzz down and say “Hey you got the call wrong, it happens.” But they failed. Just like the NFL. If the officiating doesn’t get fixed I’m done watching Football
How many PIs was that
I wouldn't be surprised if cowboys don't win their first game in the playoffs.   I'm tired of having faith in a average/below average qb like dak...  He can only beat teams that are .500 and below record.   Everytime he challenges other teams with a winning record he just chokes everytime.
"Cowboys finna do Cowboy thangs"- Shannon Sharpe
Dallas Cowboy fan, since the sixties!!!
1:49 sounded like a video game effect lmao
I swear you can’t even breathe on a receiver as a db anymore 🤦🏽‍♂️ shits a joke
😆🤣all you cowboys fans were all hyped over the cowboys beating a trash Washington football team, they play against better competition and don't step up , they gave dak and zeke to much money
We Couldn’t kick a field goal to save our lives . 😭😭
Cowboys are an average team, the offense is soft, if you play them hard they'll fold. Defense is good. This coming from a Cowboys fan.
Same ole same ole
1:16: “looks like an illegal shi-“ Oh so….
Soooooo predictable!!!! This game was exactly the same as last season against the cards except they kept there foot up Dallas s ass for the whole game ! These cowboys cannot beat a team 500 or above
Micah Parsons is proabably punching the air right now fr lmao
Dallas is going to lose in the first round they don't deserve to be in the Superbowl with the way they played today..no heart at all
A lot of people don't know how extra special this game was for Murray. So many friends, family, former coaches, etc were at this game to support him. We played at this stadium every year for the playoff games in high school and won.
to be honest thats a fumble
Am I tripping or was that ball not out at 13:37. Shoudlve been overturned
Cowboys will never be superbowl champs unless they get a difffent quarterback
Myself and 7 other family members were here at this game to support Murray. We are all Cowboys fan but when it came to this game, we all supported our hometown QB.
Dak sucks , he is worthless as a QB. They have failed because of him since he be ame a starter and once again  he has choked and can't throw the ball accurately when needed
Cheating ass refs.
Not a fan of either team but if they meet in the playoffs I expect it to go the same way. Cards are the better team overall.
I said the CARDS would win without their stars!
I will say it again Dalton Schultz is a liability to the Cowboys running game haven't made a decent block all season long. Go back and look at film he is worst than Tebow for the Jaguars.
Waning seconds of the 4th quarter-- ahhhh, the sound of silence. 👍🏼
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. ...sas... Stephen A Smith.
Hell yeah!!!! F the cowgirls 😂😂😂 #BirdGang
That missed Fieldgoal and the fumble made the game difference.
Dak sucked...but zeke is on another level of sucks  90mil rb only 20yd rushing.  Defense is ok. you cant get turnovers every week.
Dallas 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone talking about Zeke and the good run he did have was holding penalties. The runs for losses came at the hands of a sorry ass blocking tight-end in Shultz. Watch film Zeke or Pollard can get yards cause our ends cannot block worth a crap. I don't give a crap he catches balls what about blocking for other people?
It's easy to see dak is the problem
The Dallas defense is not all that. The Cardinals were missing Hopkins and Conner. Key players on offense.
cowboys are going to make superbowl champions are not ready
Jijijijijiji los muchachos vacas 🐄 solo le ganan a los de su división jijiji
Cowboys need a difffent quarterback
Man the zebras were busy today here.
Dak messed up the game when he lost the futball
Prescott is the Cowboys QB of the future. Murray just made him look average.
Play at 13:29 was a delay of game AND a fumble. Huge missed call by the refs. That was a game changing missed call. Unfortunately dallas couldn't challenge.
Non-fumble call by Edmunds at the end (2:44} there looms big.  Cowboys get that call and have plenty of time to win it.
Cowboys to the Super Bowl, stop it with those comments. Every year it’s the same story, when expectations are high that’s when the cowboys fold you know it and I know it!
I think I speak for all Cardinals fans, including myself, when I say this:       Next week, we will all be '9ers fans so we can win the NFC west
Cowboys fans just FYI, these are the type of teams that will be in the playoffs. Not the Washington no name team, not the Giants, not the Falcons and your needs to find a way to win these types of games in order to go far in the playoffs.
I swear offense always actin dumb for 3 quarters n wake up last minute. Also mike Mcarthy idiotic decisions
God im happy. I'm so sick of Dallas fan's them We Dem Boys post.
Dink & dunk Dak attack..
Trade zeke and Prescott for Aaron Rodgers next year these guys stink
As a cowboys fan they need to learn out of this lost so they would know what good teams they would face in the playoffs in my opinion the kicker and the offense need to step up their game
Rest all starters next week, need roster at full strength for playoffs.
Just as people start talking about this Dallas team has the momentum heading into the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl they lose. Same ole same ole!
Sometimes the Cowboys ae like pitbulls then other times they like poodles.
So stupid coaching get rid of zeke McCarthy and offense play caller .
They Milking the 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚 And the Bite'n @AllTimeHigh so 👻📚 🥊🔥🍳Go get some and Break out the Sketch pad NFL. ✌ New Plays Kept
I’m calling fumble yo…who’s wit me ?!?!
Thank you Cardz! Not gonna lie I had my doubts but I’ll always take being proven wrong when it comes to you getting the wins.
That’s what happens when Dallas plays a real team they loose
King kyler
great victory
Game ball goes to Kliff and Vance.. called a great game
Dallas play bad today ....playing like this u think dallas going to make super bowl...no way like i say day dak is great but he's not a super bowl qb
Cowboys played a good team & lost
Word is Shannon already in the studio waiting for skip 🤣🤣
😂😂. Classic cowboys. Always find a way to lose
That miss field goal for the cowboys costed us
That wasn't a true catch!
When that little squirt qb starts running, you need to squash that little bug Lawrence Taylor style!
i like Armstrong's sack dance.
Anytime you hear Troy commentating for the Cowboys.. We lose 😅🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅🤣 that man a Jinx!
Dallas is only good against losing teams I've been saying it all last year and this year....one and done.
This was only the third time Dallas has played an NFC team with a winning record.  They are 1-2 in those games.  Not looking so good for a team that was the #2 team in the conference at the start of the day..  FWIW, the NFC West is the most underrated division in the game this year.
This game was very enjoyable! 🦅
Cowboys deserve to lose this game messing with my fantasy championship.  If I'm not winning, they're not winning.
Dak Prescott so jealous he trying to stop Dallas and Ezekiel Elliott from winning ..
Missed fumble cost us the game
Once again the Cowboys fall behind early then spend the rest of the game trying to come back.
So we ignoring the delay of game at 13:30? Or was the play clock wrong
It's hard to beat a mobile accurate QB especially when your offenses can't put up points
Many things could have lead to a win. The ish that pissed me off with all the speed on defense and not contain AZ offense at the end of the game and let them get all those first downs. Like damn I would have had Parsons and Cox spying Murray or whoever containing the edges. Was too easy..
Dak shouldn't have ran.
Fumble?
All i saw today is three teams who don't ave much momentum going into the playoffs.#1the cowgirls don't have a running game cause Zeke is just taking Jerry's money and Dak is overrated and three they play in the nfc east which really helped them.Next team is the Rams who had a qb who is an int machine and now we know why he never won in Detroit with Megatron.stafford cant keep doing that in the playoffs if they expect to go to the show.My next team is the Brady neers who looked shaky against the jets who thet3 should have laid a 50 burger on.but they still looked better then the other two teams.stay safe people.
How bout dem Cowboys! 😁
Simmons went straight Waterboy on that play! Great win Redbirds! Getting back our mojo!
Typical cowboys can only beat the bad teams. They are right on time for another disappointing season.
Garbage Dak is only good against NFC Least teams and bad teams.  Any other team over .500 and not from the NFC Least, he gets a L.
The cowboys can’t Beat a real team
I guess delay of game doesn't seem to exist this year
As a cowboy's fan..  Fire KM. He's a joke. Pollard is your starter plain and simple  For cowboy fans that wanted dak, congrats! This is exactly what you got. Overpaid average QB that misses a ton of easy throws.   Pathetic.
So many cowboy fan comments
Can the league be more noticeable at who they want to win during what game?   With GB practically sealing #1 seed. NO 2 seed is practically worthless.   The seeding is stupid.  The only thing that benefits the seeding is the owners because they add an extra game and screw the non #1 seed  Cowboys would be #2 so this game meant more for the cardinals.   The odds were in favor of Dallas.   Meaning the refs / owners saw a clear sight to rig this game from the start.   The non call on D Law that could've ended that drive which led to early TD swung the momentum tremendously.   Every time Pollard hits a 20+ yard run Conner Williams gets a holding call.   This has happened more than once this year.   Leading to believe, the owners are dictating players future with contracts
I'm not a fan of either team but just curious, why do they boo on Amare Cooper?
Best sloppy catch I’ve ever seen
🙏🏾✝️
The statement is the same it's been for the past 20 years. Somehow, someway, The Cowboys will mess it up.
The defense did everything they've supposed to do and the offense did s*** Prescott talkin about don't get off the fan wagon and all this b******* the only can play against change that under 500 good yes he played their first game our division was very weak when he plays against another top-notch quarterback she cannot win that game
Cowgirls choked at home
Bro dak sold and the refs are blind and stupid
If they win next week against Seattle, literally nobody expected this team to be 12-5 . That's a victory
Cowboys vs the refs like always
The Cardinals making us shed a tear of joy and feel like a proud big brother as all of Ramnation cheer on lil bro taking care of business in Dallas, Texas!
That's 5 outta 6 wins Skip, and he's undefeated at AT&T Stadium 28 -0.
Dallas will never win with Dak Prescott
No estamos listos para equipos buenos, no haremos nada en postemporada
The Cowboys are at least better than last year. Dak is a clone of Romo. Plays hard and is successful but fumbles, throws a pick or misses a receiver at the end of the game. Cowboys are lacking a leader. No team respects the Cowboys offense.
Rip my parlay
Is it just me or did Joe Buck sound a bit off (a bit nasally perhaps)?  Did they speed up the tape?  Was he sick?  Ingest some helium?  Some1 mess w/ his downstairs equipment?
Arizona Cardinals 😂🤣😅
Boys stepped in a cowpie.
Where's the Dallas crew at? How do you explain that? Played like garbage the first half, then whinning about bad officiating in the second half? You lost to a team that lost the last 3. At home. Your just not that good. You have no chance at the nfc championship,  let alone the super bowl
Elliot needs to go... he's good for nothing.
Dallas always does the same thing, season after season, they always act cocky and ending losing!
This game shows that Dak is still the weakest link for the cowboys. He can make the big plays when it counts. His turnovers have been the cowboys downfall all year. To conservative play calling as well. Looks like another one and done playoff appearance. Not worth 40 million a year. I hope he reads this.
How can the Cowboys have so much talent, firepower, advantages and still come up short in situations that matter?
wtf cardinaALS  are ass!
Those Red Birds migrated from the Arizona Heat and landed in Dallas, 🚫 not Angry, but Pissed 😡 to The Highest of Pisstivity and took it out on The Cowboys which left the Gun Slingers dazed and confused 😕 wondering 🤔 how they lost to The Cardinals who lately, was stumbling around the yard with Broken 💸 Wings!!!
Dak has absolutely NO versatility to his movement. Dude will see a defender in his face and not even try to pump fake or juke out the way. He'd rather throw it straight to them than actually move around. He's like that default character you have to pick when you got nobody else
If joe buck lost his voice, I wouldn’t mind.
Cardinals showing they still a very good team
And we suck again
Cowboys were really overrated lol.
SMASH THE LIKE BUTTON IF YOU FINALLY REALIZE THE DALLAS COWBOYS ARE CLEARLY OVERRATED...jus look at their schedule.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mvp back baby
dak gotta step up their secondary isn't good enough
"Cowboys do Cowboy things."- Unc Sharpe
Skiiiiiiiiiup 😂
DAK doesn’t play with urgency till it’s to late and kellen is not a good play caller Just run the damn ball.
We need another Aikman
Get a quarterback dak will never be a playoff quarterback
Cowboys need a real Quarterback
Pinche cowgirls son mierda 💩
"Playing against the refs again, like usual,'' said Dallas' Randy Gregory. "It seems like an every-week occurrence. We just have to tune that out and just deal with it.”
Cards are 9-2 when former All-Pro center Rodney Hudson is starting.
Some amazing catches on both sides
As a cowboy fan.   I saw this coming.   Never gonna go to a SB with Dak at the helm.
Get rid of dak and brown van joseph
Vander Esch: “It was totally a fumble, and I just don’t understand how, with the technology we have nowadays, even if we don’t have timeouts or whatever it may be … Certain things are so obvious. …To me, we’re playing more against the refs than other teams.”
What's funny about the Cowboys losing this game is that this almost solidify the standings that the Cardinals and the Cowboys will meet again in the 1st round.  Since the Cardinals have beaten them, they will most likely do it again.  And all these delusional Cowboys fans thinking are about to win the SB will wake up to reality.
No one is talking about how Dallas is struggling with the Tampa 2 defense. 2 deep safeties taking away the big play all because the run isn't there. Prescott deserves some of the blame but not all. Where is the run game? Why isn't the O.C. calling better plays?
I love it when the cowboys lose 😆🙌🏾🙌🏾
🤠 👢 🤠 👢 🤠 👢
Cowgirls got bailed out so much too
The cowboys are better this year compared to recent years, but they still cannot win when it really matters.
Dallas need a good quarterback!
Ive said for 20+ yrs now..Cowgirls wont even sniff a SB until Jones is no longer the owner...He's the AL Davis of the Cowboys.  They have the talent, but no quality coach is going to me a YES MAN...so with no quality coach team will always underperform.   Sadly, just having a star on the helmet is not going to get them a ring....
Ha ha, love it when Dallass loses! All the Jerah Jones kiss a__ _ were bragging about how great they are cause they beat Washington! Ha ha ha !!!
If Dallas somehow could play against The Football Team from Washington  17 times and again in the SB.
Can’t wait to see what Skip Baylees says after this loss by The Cowgirls aka DemBums lmao! Still can’t beat a REAL team! Would like to see Aaron Rogers dismantle this secondary ngl tbh..
Yes 💪🏾💪🏾
Dallas: I almost had you  Cardinals: you never had your car!
I think dak needs more money
How bout dam stankin Cowboyz?
First time Dallas plays a real team and this happens Dallas has the easiest schedule in the league don't gas em up
Cowboys losing to Cardinals that don't have their star WR, star RB, only 1 starting DB, and half their offensive and defensive line.
WE MUST SIGN ANTONIO BROWN ALL CUZ OF MY GOOD MAN MICHAEL GALLUP INJURY REMEMBER IT'S SUPER BOWL OR DINOBOWL.....
Lol cowboys suck haha what losers
Cowboys - "America's Team", yea okay.
Why is the blame on Diggs when the defense as a whole didn't play as well as they have Diggs gets the blame but he is the best we gave.
Yes at the end it was a fumble and delay of game but we shouldn't  be depending on that to win
YES! F Texas!
What a shocker. Cowboys lose by a field goal and zeurlein missed a field goal early in the game. Hate this guy
Dallas going to the superbowl😂😂😂
Cowboys should have won if it weren’t for our kicker and if we had a timeout to call the fumble but yk it is what it is
And trade the coaching staff as well. Jones made such a stupid bonehead with Jimmy Johnson.... Doesn't know talent at any level. Other than digging for oil.
You don't know which cowboy team will show up at the playoffs. I wouldn't be surprised either way, to tell you the truth.
This just shows how average Dallas is they can't even beat a team like the Cardinals that have been getting their ass kicked ever since they played the Lions so I think people need to cool their Jets on how talented this cowboy squad is
Dallas will choke in the playoffs as they just to inconsistent with such talent. Therefore trade Elliot. Once they get the big contracts they produce less.
Dallas is trash with shitty dak and zeke overpaid shitty players
Ez an Dak overrated
As a Packs fan. Thank you, Cards!!!! 😂
Dallas needs a kicker, QB, corner, and a safety
The ball came out at the end of the play. Refs bailed out cards
LETS GO CARDINALS🔴🔴🔴🌊🌊🌊
Dak played horrible Mediocre
I knew once cowboys had to play against a winning team that they weren’t gonna do good
Haahhaha nice one Dallas. Pathetic team pathetic fans. Pathetic state.
Run the ball!
Refs won that game. Pathetic.
This video doesn’t make it clear but that was a fumble at the end. Unlucky they had no timeouts to challenge. I’m not a cowboys fan btw.
And I was gonna quit smoking today if they won. SMH.
the first two times the cowboys had the ball said it all on just how the game was going to end .. THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS  turns out against a good team .. losers .. dak is not the qb moore is not hwo we need . mike is laming the refs ..  when a team comes together and looks in the mirror and believes no one lost this game but us , only then will they wake up ..  . already blaming the refs .. . yep a couple of bad calls . butthey did not cost this team the win .period ..  I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET ON BOARD WITH THIS TEAM I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF FOR OVER 60 YEARS .. ALL THE TALENT IN THE WORLD THIS TEAM HAS one the healthest this year . and still play that poorly ...the only way this team can get the respect they think they deserve is win out and win the super bowl till then  we will still be in that pit we have been in for 25 years or so ..
Buddy Baker is a very strong small person😂 that man be taking down giants by himself no kizzy
I guess those cowboys fans wont be screaming this week huh...🤣😂🤣😂...at least support your own dam team first instead of a out of town team ...that star really has an impact on people...they ain't America's team...they are just like all other teams😂🤣😂🤣😂
Been a Cowboys fan forever. I remember the 90s and those teams you just knew were dominant. They did what they had to and showed up in big moments. Hence 3 Superbowls. The last 10-15 years since Romo and now to Dak it's a team that either plays down to the talent level of the other team or only beats the semi-good teams. They don't beat the good teams. The WFT, yes you are supposed to beat them. But where is that same explosiveness against good teams like Arizona. Now obviously give Arizona credit they are good too. But these Cowboys have been the same way for years now. I don't get my hopes up even when we are having a decent season because they just don't show up for big games anymore.  Been they way since Romo. Sure they will make the playoffs but don't expect anything. Like I said you knew the 90s teams were gonna be there. Today's Cowboys just don't show up when it counts. Sorry. I do love my Cowboys but have to be realistic. They gotta start beating the good teams not just the WFT teams.
One week makes a big difference in the NFL, especially when the opposing Team's talent level is much greater than your own.  I dont see the Cowboys doing much in the Playoffs.  The Cowboys just dont measure-up to the really good teams.  The Steelers have the 'terrible towel', the Cowboys need the 'crying towel'.  This is going to be a sad ending season real quick.
The only thing you can hear from the crowd is booing, at the cowboys team. At the cowboys stadium?
Always a pleasure to see "America's Team" take another one in the shorts.
Fumble tho
Just a preview of the playoffs. Zeke wasn't even a factor. Dak isn't on the same level as Arizona's quarterback. Cooper is just a joke. 1st round exit.
I don't know if anyone read my post about this game but I guaranteed a loss by Dallas because this is what they do. Cardinals come limping in and Dallas plays down to the competition. I've been a fan for many years but I've learned that being on this Cowboys bandwagon is just a serious waste of time. Doesn't matter the coach or players Jerry's teams are always the same. They simply cannot win when it counts and winning today would have at least given them a chance a the #1 seed but they failed once again. They'll play the Cardinals in the first round with the same results. Another season circling the drain. I can hear Jerry now, just wait until next year.
dak's accuracy is a big problem. the injury seems to mess him up. either way the cowboys are not making it to the even the conference finals.
Cowboys and cowboys fans thought this was going to have the same outcome of last weeks game!! Cowboys can't beat winning team's but they can sure beat losing team's 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dak was awful today.
Dak clost the cowboys
Nfl playoffs and superbowls are rigged by the illuminati freemasonry satanic system
Typical Dak, Can’t do anything until the games out of hand. Typical Dak Prescott, beats up on bad teams and loses the good teams but he still got paid. SMH 🤦🏼‍♂️
Joe Buck is a one dimensional, hack! ...and the passsss...is... CAUGHT! 😴
It starts and ends with Dak! End of story!!!. There were several  opportunities  for Dak to keep drives alive and his accuracy  is absolutely  horrible.!! 40 million  dollar year QB...! Your out of your mind!
Still them boys? Looks like little girls to me😂
Nope my cowboys are one and done in the playoffs for sure we cant be a dumb ass team
P.S.  Dallas is not going to beat Tampa Bay, Green Bay, L.A. Rams, or Arizona.  So, who they going to beat?
Cardinals Suck lol
Aikman is always making excuses when the COWPATTIES stink up the place! 🐄💩 Then he goes silent. He's such an unprofessional homer! 😆
How bout them cowgirls!
Great job number one offensive line
Sorry ass cowgirls!!
Put 60 on Washington and lose the next week Dallas can’t even beat sub par good teams
The same inconsistent crap.  Cowboys lost to themselves again, they are their own worst enemy.  The backs have got to turn their heads.  Everyone learned that in junior high, and yet in the NFL these idiots don't follow a basic rule.  The kicking coach needs his guys to kick 500 field goals a week.  They suck.  Offensive line needs a strength coach.  These guys get man handled every game.  I feel bad for the quarter backs.
มันมาก
God Bless The Cardinals!
their kicker will hurt cowboys fans
Well looks like they’ll be playing again in two weeks.. at AT&T Stadium 😬 Cowboys will be better next time.
that's a shame on the  Cowboys not showing  any respect for their fans the best fans of NFL.  Cowboys draw money from selling tickets n ppl paying to see their team lose at home.  these guys don't have any pride in their team. its weird Prescot played like dummy making  bad decisions but they make a lot money!!!!  Cowboys are fake wrestlers makin u think they fighting but on the other hand they betting on the other team that way they make money on the whole deal.. no super bowl  contender that's for sure!!!!
Cowboys have to learn to beat play off teams or they will be one and done.
Dak is garbage...call it what it is people
Never underestimate the ability of Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot to choke in a big game.
Surprise surprise Dallas loses to a good team. Coming from a cowboys fan.
refs f****** sucks , thats a fumble
omg again we need a new kicker
I see the referees tried to give cowboys this game
Wait a minute, haven't we been hearing from the NFL media for the last three weeks how "bad" the Cardinals are and how "great" the Phallus Doughboys are? I wonder what will be said now......Go Cards!!!
Prater made the kicks. Victory screech
Cowboys have to win these games...
Hahahahaha how bout Dem cowgirls
What a job by the Cards defense. Still can’t believe Simmons came all the way from the backfield to make the play on Prescott. Much needed wins for AZ. I think the Rams are still gonna win the division, but at least they made it interesting with this win
Yep, I can see us losing in the first round of the playoffs. We just refuse to beat a team with a winning record. Plus Zeke is washed 🤷🏾‍♂️ don't get your hopes up Cowboys fans, we're headed for disappointment...
These god damn bums had one job bruhh
updated highlight vid style is nice show ever posetion is dope
Dallas shouldn't have lost to a depleted cardinals team. No excuses. It'll be fun to possibly see them against my Packers
I was at this game today. Tough to see the Cowboys shoot themselves in the foot in person 🤣
Washington had yall on that high horse lmao!
“We are who I thought we were!”   - Me, A Dallas Fan
As a Dallas fan this was extremely hard to watch
Prescott is off again. He needs to fix it.
Cowboys always find a way to lose a game. 😂
So all the top NFC teams are gonna be dead locked if the cheese heads loose tonight
My Cardinals needed those losses to bring our injured roster closer to together and believe in ourselves.  They look different now, more serious.
I blame Dak Prescott for this one he needs to do more running if he can't find a man open get a few more yards and slide don't wait until the end of the game all that staying in the pocket just ain't working pay attention to all the other teams they play the quarter back running the ball come on cowboys baby let's get it together.. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Every cowboy fan don't want to say it, but I' will. DALLAS cannot win when playing another team with a winning record!!!!!! ( This is a big problem in the playoffs!!!!!!!! ) One Lost and your out!!!!!!!
Statement play. 100%
Packer backer here. Thank you Cards. If the pack beats the Vikings we lock of the conference. Side note: It bothers me Cousins is not playing. I was looking forward to a hard fought division game with playoff implications. Of course I am assuming the Packers will beat the Vikes easily now that Cousins is out. Now I going to scroll down and read all the Skip comments. LOL
those two pass interference calls in the 2nd are prob the two worst calls this season
After scoring a TD Mike Mccarthy needs to learn how to manage time. If we had a timeout then we could've challenged a Chase Edmonds fumble and possibly could've scored.
Cowboys were affected by the usual 50+ point curse, they just weren't focused enough because of the big win on WFT
Prescott is a Bum!
Momentum is a word thrown around . Momentum can be stop by a greater opposing force any time. So it is not a given that it will carry to the next game.
Cowboys will not succeed without their run game. Dont know why they cant see that. Prescott is good, hes not that good.
How is Dallas the #1 rated offense still.  Despits walking away with wins they havent performed well in weeks.
Cardinals will go to the superbowl... y'all need to start paying attention, debate a wall.
Cowboys are in trouble can't beat good teams always falling behind and look like trash vs playoff teams smh..
The Arizona Cardinals have actually beaten the Cowboys 5 of the last 6 meetings.
We will see them again this season…..
Just remember this is the same cowboys team who MASSACRED Washington last week and this week they get their tails handed to by Arizona
roller coaster perform by cowboys...
Dallas made a statement alright.  They lack the maturity and focus to win an important game against a worthy opponent.  Daks accuracy inconsistency has always been an issue and he proved tonight that he is no closer to solving that skill set deficiency.  Unfortunately pass accuracy is at the top of the list of important attributes for a competitive nfl quarterback.
Cowboys the ultimate choke team.
Idk how the Cardinals ever lose. Kyler seems impossible to stop
gg red team
FFS i was actually rooting for the cowgirls this time and they took a fat L - rams fan
8-0 @ at&t
DAK PRESCOTT IS TRASH..
It was a fumble
This is the cowboys against a good team... failed
As a Dallas fan I’ve always said that Prescott is an overrated quarter  he hasn’t proven anything and with this playoff like atmosphere against the Cardinals at home who was on a three-game losing streak still couldn’t win with a four-game winning streak….. Dak is the weak link and needs to be cut…. . I guaranteed the Dallas Cowboys will lose in the first round….. until Jerry Jones stops believing he is GM and Dak stops believing he is a good QB….
Dude I was at this game and the fans were very loud!
this shows that the cowboys will struggle in the playoffs. Also Kyler played his ass off that game. Imagine if he gets D-Hop and the defense back in the postseason and we might see 1st half of the season cards.
I think Dak Prescott is good. They need to cut Elliot off the team. He's not good he was good for one year. He's to comfortable now. He don't want rings he wants only dollar signs. Elliot trash
I have yet to see how Dak was the right choice over Romo.
No run game, no win !!!
Cowboys fans don’t fret cards are a good team. And kyler wasn’t gonna lose at home away from home. But can u imagine card’s could possibly be a wildcard team who’s gonna play them in the first round?
If the roles were opposite, the cards were health and Dallas was injured, cards would lose
Dallas was UNPREPARED to play. Missed FG, dropped punt, fumble by Prescott less than 50 yds offense by Lamb, Elliott and Cooper by the 4th Q, its simply poor preparation. That's on Moore and McCarthy. Unprepared. Zeurlein has cost several games, against Brady he missed three, against Raiders he missed a simple PAT and against this mob he missed his initial FG which cost an O/T. Simply NOT PREPARED.
Skip is gonna be mad tomorrow.
Dallas lost?  But Jeff Heath isn’t on the team anymore.  I’ve been reliably informed by reliable sources that the Cowboys were undefeated in franchise history before he got there, and undefeated after he left.  And they won ZERO games during his tenure.
At the end of the game the cardinals delayed the game that was uncalled. They proceeded to throw a pass and it was caught. The receiver fumbled and it was recovered my Dallas. The refs called it as a reception tho. If it had been called correctly Dallas would have 1:58 to score a touchdown and the game would be over. Two atrocious missed calls gave the cardinals the W. I ain’t gonna lie, Dallas was bad on both sides of the ball but if either of those calls were made Dallas would still have the number 1 seed in their sights. Stop calling them trash.
Cowboys CHOKED like alwys thy can't beat a playoff team, no matter how good is the O n D they lose under pressure n against good teams
the refs gave dallas their first touchdown with those 2 bogus pass interference calls,.  the first one took away a cardinal interception
Cowgirls are 4 Ever 🚮!!!
As long as Dallas loses .😀
y'all lost to the cardinals 🤣🤣🤣 trash
Great game CARDINALS AND THE COWBOYS. I was hoping this is NOT going to be a BLOWOUT. With out HOPKINS, they still got it done. But it ain't over yet... they will meet again.
Can’t wait for some of our guys to get healthy come playoff time, ggs Dallas.
Hopefully Prescott will sleep good tonight in his sleep number bed despite that fumble and lackluster performance. Elliot should be cut. The cowboys once again are imposters. I predict they lose their first playoff game.
What’s up with the juggle caught with the cowgirls ?🥴🙄
Dak is so over-rated...  waste  of $40,000,000 a year
Arizona cardinals had alot of injuries this year best players out and still won the game by 3 points not a easy win a good win happy new years to Arizona welcome 2022 rise up red birds 2022 happy new years cowgirls still suck lol ha ha
I'm a cowboys fan but I had a gut feeling this wasn't going to turn out well right when you need your team to pull it in they always let you down
Prescott couldn’t hit a target if you gave him a Bat.
I hope the offense can do better next match especially the kicker
Cowboys have failed to address the offensive problems the entire year. It will come back to bite us, with a loss to Philly and one and done in the playoffs. We have had plenty of time to sort it out. I feel like our time has run out, but anything can happen in the post season,
Man, all week everybody jinxin my boys.
Espn and all the talk shows really highlighted the downfall of the cardinals and hyped up the cowboys and pretty much everyone picked cowboys to just dominate them and now look
Eat it, Cowgirls!
Everyone on dallas secondary is really average… Yeah they get picks but thats because of bad balls these guys get burnt everyplay
Always a good day to see cowboys and there fans get humbled.
Well Dallas you just showed you can't play with the big boys 🥴🥴🥴
How bout dem cowboys 😂😂😂😂 say goodbye to #1 for the nfc
Lmao how bout them cowboys ?!!!? 😂😂🤣😭
Nice win Arizona cardinals not a easy win in a hostile Dallas cowboys stadium go cardinals rise up red birds Dallas cowgirls still suck horse shoes lol ha ha
With that 40 million dollar RB,what does his performance in game equal = 1 yard per million dollars ?.when he lost a yard,didn't get 1st down,do they take a million dollars back??Beat by a West Texas quarterback. I love it.Neanderthals lives matter. LOSERS.
Ahahahaha 😂🤣
Lol that missed field goal made the cowgirls lose BOO HOO
Texas cannot stop the run .
Slow it down and that was for SURE a Cards fumble there at the end. That or he was out of bounds, both would have changed the ending completely. Hate to see it...
I can't got dn believe you guys let the Cardinals beat us AT HOME . DAK YOU BETTER GET IT TOGETHER FAST IF NOT YOU JUST LET US ALL DOWN WOW 22 POINTS AT HOME WOW
The Cowboys sure put the league on notice!! I told y’all Cowboys were a bunch of frauds that only beat up weak teams!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Elliot ran the ball 9 times.
As a cowboys fan dak can't carry a team. He was off. Go cowboys
Dallas DB s garbage!!!
Dak was pretty bad.
Cardinals are a first round exit without Hopkins and Conner.
Just beat the cowboys so Brady doesn’t have to💪🇺🇸
Plenty of blame to go around for this one but the OLINE was the real killer today.   5 crucial holding calls after first downs.  Felt like turnovers.  One and done in the playoffs, especially if they play the Cards again.
Dak cannot beat defenses who run man coverage. Not great man coverage,  just ok man coverage. The only way he has any success against aggressive defenses like the cardinals is when they can run the football and they can't do that. Dallas offensive line is atrocious except Zack Martin. Tyrone Smith is at the end of a great career. Undisciplined, penalties (a problem all year long) Greg the leg missed yet another field goal. Daks inability to read thru his progressions (some of that the fault of his weak O line) and I believe Pollard should start every game from here on out. What's worse is now your tied into big money contracts with a running back and quarterback that isn't close to earning it. Harsh words, but I've been a fan of this team since Roger Staubachs last year in the league. I believe I've earned the right to call it like I see it. Oh, and if Kellen Moore calls one more wide receiver screen I think I'll lose my mind! We may win one playoff game. Maybe....
Crazy how a rookie and a defensive end in randy gregory getting paid 1.1 million dollars a year are looking like the best players on a team that has a 75 million dollar qb
How 'bout them cowboys??    LOL
I had the Cardinals from the jump..
Cowgirls are overrated
You do not  want to be the #1 seed, a week off is a killer of muscles and tempo. Nothing can simulate a football game. No unbeaten team has won the super bowl. The week of rest is happening while charlie is getting stronger in the bush.
They need to start Tony pollard and have Elliott come in on 3rd down runner
Cowboys still haven’t beat a top tier team. So overrated.
As a lifelong cowboys fan I can tell you unless the defense wins the game we won't win between Dak fumbling and an inept offense it's all on the defense that's why I've been saying for years we will never ever win another super bowl or even go to one as long as Jerry Jones owns that team. I've been saying this every year before the season even started since he fired Jimmy Johnson and I've been right and I'm right again.
Ah yes, great to see Dallas in Playoff form 🤣🤣🤡🤡 Go Cards K1
Don't be mad Cowturd fans. When McCarthy coached my Packers we could never beat Arizona either. You'll have a chance 4 revenge in two weeks while we're taking the week off.  #GoPackGo in dis Bih
Dallas should be a 9-7 team. They’ve gotten a couple lucky games. The better team won
How about them cowgirls they can't be the winning team to save their life overrated is an understatement
Can’t believe everybody thought the Cowboys were gonna win.. they haven’t beat a good team yet.
Joy to see Dallas lose! Congrats to the Cardinals!
Dak and Zeke aren't at the level you need to be to win playoff games and Greg the egg lays another one. 25 years of thinking we have an elite quarterback and we still don't.
Americas team in the worst division...hope they make the playoff...wanna see them get blown out
Dallas is not a good team, I'm a life long Cowboys fan, since I was a kid, grew up watching Troy, Emmit, Micheal, Jay Novachek, Moose Johnson and etc....  Dallas punches down, beats up on teams they should win and plays garbage against winning teams.  Dak is a ok quarterback, not worth the money but hell I'm happy he got his, I foresee a first round exit this year, I think Dallas should be looking to draft  a quarterback in the future, I know its a team game but this up and down play from Dallas is sickening.
3:45 he said forget it imma just catch you.....
I knew the cards were dangerous.  I was hoped we wouldn't come in over confident but damn it would have been nice to see my boys try harder . Congrats cards fans
Big win for Arizona.
Digs  either getting burned or catching a pick that is so funny to me lol
This will never happen but perhaps someone else should be calling the plays?
Didn't see the cards winning this with their play as of late. The cowgirls that bad?
statement game my @$$ 🤣🤣🤣
This game made it clear that the Cowboys aren’t ready to compete with the better teams.
PASS IS CAUGHT
From the looks of it, this was hyped scrimmage because they'll probably play again in a couple of weeks.
Big win for Arizona....GO CARDINALS!!!
Here's hoping Kingsbury is much better in January than in December! Loved the fake punt call!
Sign Antonio brown
The Cowboys got exposed. For the shity team they truly are.
Penalties are the flag boys biggest weakness.
RIP John Madden
So.  The cow chumps are same same. Flash and dash then fade away
The ones that were calling the football games were wrong a new rule indicate they can call it down from the top section and challenge
i dont understand dallas, has one of the most impressive rosters in football but cant ever beat any top teams
For the amount of talent that Dallas possesses they are garbage and they will be one and done, the playoffs 100%
Dallas NOT in the Super Bowl! YES!
Once again, Dallas O line manages to screw it up plus missed field goal and bad timing on timeouts. Good job Defense!
Skip will have a hard time taking notes on how to defend his boys in the show🌈
Unfortunately Dallas, u ain’t playing my pathetic team. Just shows u put numbers up against the NFL’s shittist teams convincing the so called experts, that u r all that. Look at the Garbage QB’s u faced these last 4 weeks. Heinicke x2, Glennon, Fromm Allen & Hill, acting all big ur SB bowl bound. Go back to bed cowgirls fans. Face a good team missing their 3 best players, look what happens. Dallas basically been facing back up teams 👏🏻
Catch by Ward on the game punt HAS to be catch of the year
Cardinals break down the Cowboys......
Prescott throws like a highschool quarterback sometimes. So often I see him put the ball in terrible spots on wide open receivers 🤦‍♂️
Cardinals win even with a fumble at the end but it wasnt a fumble stay salty cowgirl fans
This was a good game... but the fact dallas played so bad and still should have won this game is not a good look for the CARDS... they doged a huge bullet on that fumble with 2 minutes to play
Those two PI calls where the flag came in 'late' that's the league reminding the ref in his ear of how many points they need scored
What is skip going to say tomorrow lmaoo is all I’m looking forward to
I really dk why they keep playing zeke, it has to be the money they spent on him at this point. Rough start but good game tho, God bless those who see this.
tHiS iS oUr YeARr
Would have gone to overtime if Greg Zuerline wasnt so ass
Did mike mccarthy fumble this game 😒 poor clock management
Was a good game! But hate to say it, none of these teams will win the Superbowl, come on be real!!!
Cowgirls can't beat a 500 or better team. Just can't. One and done in the playoffs guaranteed
Wait so them boys lost an obj got a crucial 4th down  catch immediately followed by a walk-off winning touchdown touchdown.yeah skip in trouble unc better wipe the floor with him 2morrow. Can't wait
The Dallas Cowboys are a big catfish in a dirty pond called the NFC East. The best of the BOTTOMFEEDERS.
And once again we know that Dak is an overpaid hyped qb that just shines against weak teams.
I told you fools dallas was gonna lose hahaha
Just knew after the game was over the NFL wouldn't show the slow motion replay of the blown missed fumble call to end the game. Fu! Roger Goodell!!!
This should shut the pathetic Cowgirls for at least one week.
I stated during the preseason the Cowgirls are not going any where.  I also predicted they would lose against Tampa in their first game.  I, again, stated during the regular season Dallas was going no where.  I am stating, now, before the playoffs, they are going no where.  AGAIN, they are over-rated, they are in the weakest division, and they have the easiest schedule.  When they play good teams (Tampa, Chiefs, Raiders, Arizona, etc.) they LOSE!!!  Moreover, their fans are also losers and cry babies.  Always making excuses: Covid, injuries, referees are against them.  Yeah right, cry me a river.
Dak's sleep number is "L"
Mike McCarthy is a joke of a head coach and the last 3 minutes proved it
Wert
I am not surprised, Dak, Zeke, Tyron Smith and Kellen Moore are the problem. Don't y'all see when Tyron Smith as of late missed games the Cowboys run the ball better and essentially win the games. With Tyron in we can't run And we lose! It's time to let him go!!!
America's favorite team 😅
Had the cards winning this game and knew they was gonna win this game classic cowboys I tell ya
All I'm going to say to you Dallas Cowboy fans.. and my brother included " another good run but no cigar😏👍💯
I really can't stand when Troy Aikmen announces our games. Dude was my hero growing up but now... F*** that guy!
Just goes to show u how bad the cowboys really are lol
NOT a good way to end the regular season Cowboys fans. Chances are the starters rest next week against the Eagles, but how do the Cowboys feel good about their playoff chances after this loss? This is a team who doesn't seem ready to make a deep run. If I am right, it will be interesting to see what Jerry does in the off season. I hope he considers Moore to head coach, or he maybe gone. McCarthy doesn't seem to be a factor in the growth of this team or the leadership to win some of these close ones.
Long time Cowboys fan. But never liked dak.
Dallas team is pathetic
Everytime the cowboys lose. America wins
If the cowboys got Russell Wilson.  They be scary asf.
Refs are trash on both sides as usual! But we will get back Arizona when we play them in the playoffs
Whatever Dallas' players and coaches did this week..   Yeah, don't do that.
Same old story. Everyone puts their money on the Cowboys and they underperform. Their line has not been dominant since Frederick was diagnosed. The defense had a chance to make the Cardinals go 3 and out at the end of the game too. So this was just an all around typical Cowboys game. Well typical for when they play a playoff caliber team anyway
That missed fg didnt help them
My football team was pissed, because of the Cardinals Won.
smh Cowboys barely lost...
Honestly as a cards fan I'd be down to take next week off for our players. No point in fighting for any sort of home field in the playoffs since we are terrible at home. Or maybe just play the first half and see how the rams game is going. No point to risk anything.
Whys the crowd booing @ 12:45
Rams now have the 2nd seed!!!! We need to beat the 49ers next week but Kyle Shanahan is mcvays krypotonite. #hornsup
The Cowboys have beat 2 wining teams ALL year and those teams were the Chargers in week 2 and the Panthers in week 4 LMAOOO
Swap kickers and things change quick here lol
The fast pace crap. The Buffalo  Bills used to run this crapy Didn't  do them any good. Sh`;;t
Daks accuracy is terrible..Receiver have to double work to catch the ball..I see the refer helping out lam on bullshit call...of pass inference
Why do people call the Cowboys SB contender? Best win is against NE (which was 2-4 at the time) They're 1-3 against AFC West (best SD by only 3 points) They've lost to TB and AZ (which had a 3-game losing streak)...
Someone call 911 for Skip,😁!
Dak doing Dak things and being avg at best against good teams. Burrow beats the Chiefs with a worse O Line and defense
Cowboys took it easy because we already clinched the playoff spot. Still, should have won this one. Greg has to hit those easy 40 yarders
They will meet again. If the regular season ends today, Cowboys will meet Cardinals again. I don't think it makes any different for 1 more game to end the regular season.
The Cowboys have a good record because of the easy schedule they have had this year, all of their wins have came against teams with losing records, the Cowboys are not good enough to compete in the playoffs against the elite teams, another failed season from the Cowboy organization, that will make it what, like 27 seasons in a row now🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can just hear Skip in the morning, he’s going to lose his mind.
Cowboys defense fire
I saw this coming a mile away Dallas is a sham just having an easy schedule and beating not great team
Cowboys are so damn overrated I've been saying this sh*t they go against good teams and lose
Some Thoughts: 1) Dallas is good against bad teams, poor against good teams, 2) Dak is not a SB QB, way too innacurate and inconsistent, 3) Dallas is badly coached, too many penalties, 4) OL is exceedingly overrated, 5) Zeurlein should be cut NOW, 6) I'd give C. Williams an ultimatum-if he gets one more key holding penalty, he's gone! 7) running game is seriously anemic, 9) Nashon Wright needs to be cut, and 10) T. Biadasz  needs to be replaced and quickly
Hahaha
Kellen Moore keeps looking more like Garrett. We have good passing plays then just calls a run up the middle which doesn’t work.
I had a feeling the cards would somehow win. Even with the injuries.
Well skip might not come to work😂🤣
We didn't play bad.  But Murray beat us with his legs his a mobile QB alot of those big plays opened up because he ran for first downs. Cedric showed up I was impressed on his good play and Dalton Shultz.  Dak Prescott fucken ran he never runs just that fumble cost us. AND GREG THE LEG COST US THE GAME WE WOULD OF PLAYED OVER TIME SO LETS GET RID OF HIM HIS GARBAGE ... GO DALLAS NO MATTER WHAT
Daloss cowboys
Nothing pleases me more than those cowboys losing!
I wana see Cedric Wilson throw a pass to Trevon Diggs on offense in game
Cowboys are not a Super Bowl team.
Some of yall need to chill TF out.. you act as if the cowboys got blew out.. this was a great game played by both teams.. that missed field goal at the beginning was crucial.. if they played again, I didn't see anything from the cardinals that makes me believe that they are just way better than the cowboys.. relax+
Arizona CARDINALS 25 vs 22 Dallas COWBOYS
If Dallas can’t get it together against winning teams, they will go one and done.
This doesnt look like a superbowl caliber Cowboys team to me. They have such good talent on both side of the ball and still struggle to beat teams with winning records. Im genuinely not surprised.
NFL Fans when Cowboys lose: WE ARE DONE FOR WE ARE FRAUDS.  NFL Fans when other teams lose: its good we need to pickup and we will be good to go next game.
Watched the Cardinals when they first moved to Phoenix. They would  play at Sun Devil stadium, there was more Cowboys fans at the game than AZ fans today's win feels like payback.
The cowgirls showed their true colors again , CHOKE TIME....
I hAve thought this a long time: to get to the Super Bowl a team has to play at a high level every week -and win every week- Prescott is not an elite  QB and until Dallas has one they are going nowhere. He is erratic: one week he throws for 7 TD's, and the next week defenses bat his passes down. To me he lacks a 'fire in his belly' that separates winners from the average.
The players with all the money 💰 are under performing. Cardinals were under manned and still won.
Once again cowboys play a decent team, another loss , they look great against the nfc least,they're defense is so dominant, blah blah blah
Another game controlled by Refs
Cowgirls best this best that blah blah blah they the best alright if you at or under 500 BUM ASS COWGIRLS!!!!
I love the Cowboys but they still can't win against good teams. Would be very lucky to get to NFC championship
Skip crying in the car 🚗😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dallas offense and Dak are both possible poor. Unless the opposition socks lol. Cowboys will be sitting at home after their 1st playoff game. Then maybe they will draft a awesome quarterback.  Not some overpaid, playoff losing, no Superbowl winning team. Of course for this to happen the Cowboys need a new owner lol.
I thought I heard this was supposed to be a "statement game" for Dallas? I guess they never specified what type of statement...
Let's go Cards 🤘
That missed FG & that fumble = 6 points. Dallas running game wilted.
Murray is a video game player when healthy. He literally can wind up and throw the ball in the same time it takes most quarterbacks to do a shovel pass. His release is so insanely quick you can’t even jump in the air to plug the lane.
Les gooo we on top!
Inconsistent Dak Kellen Moore predictable in big time games  No excuse for this offense to have 7 points going into the 4th
Thanks cardinals. From an eagles fan
Well this was a statement game but the statement was made by the team that didn't state they were trying to make a statement.
Like I said get unload Prescott and Elliott and Cowboys would win super Bowl
Cowboys shot themselves in the foot, (Refs didnt make it no better wit them horrible calls against Dallas), smfh. Its all good tho, most likely the Cowboys & Cards will meet up in the 1st round & trust me, the results/outcome will be different !!!, (Dallas gone beat the Cardinals, WATCH !). Nonetheless, good game Arizona, see u in 2 weeks.  Oh btw, cut Greg "the leg" NOW !!!!.
Kyler Murray had a great performance for Arizona as the Cards stay in pursuit of the Rams for the NFC West title.
Probably one of the BEST NFC games I've seen since 2015
🤣 😂 😂 🤣 😂 😜   What happens when cowboys play playoff caliber teams    Good luck in the playoffs!!!
It was a good  game! Team work was good, strategy needs improvement.  🤠How about them cowboys!
Y'all beat up on trash teams coming into this game, this was ur statement game and failed🤣😂🤣 one and done!
This team can beat up on bad teams sure, but this is what we do against the good ones? C'mon man!
Cowgirls Sucks 😂😂😂😂
Raiders Nation 🔥🔥
This is what the cardinals do....
Why do the boys lose their confidence when it comes to bigger and badder teams man??? They have it in them they just need to stop doubting themselves. Stop being scared you’ll get hurt again because if that’s all you think about you won’t succeed cause you are holding yourself back… Come on Dak and Zeke do better… I can’t with y’all sometimes 🤦🏽‍♀️
i only gotta say this HOW BOUT THEM COWGIRL"S .. HAHAHAHAHA
Cards missing alot of talent. Hope everyone is healthy for playoffs. Hopkins, one of the best wrs in the league out. Jj watt out James Conner, a td machine for this team, out. Markus who has been on a sack tear, out. Dj Humphries, starting online men out. Rondale Moore, a big difference maker in the passing game. Out. If they can heal up for the playoffs...
As a cowboys fan, I have been watching the trend and I have seen we cannot beat caliber teams. I mean the Cardinals without their star receiver....As a fan we are gonna be one and done.
I know Stephen A Smith is hyped with the Dallas cowboys losing today , “HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Please Arizona. 🙏 We got this! 2022 btw. Title is wrong
Cardinals needed this win badly today after 3 weeks of losing big time , especially since losing to the Lions and Colts In back to back weeks , they need to ride momentum to the NFL postseason
Deandre?? Where you at? Cardinals and Rams all day!!!😊
So sad when Murray is what is considered role model material
We beat up on teams who have all their starters out & then get dominated against the cardinals who didn’t even have their starters healthy 😢 The win against Washington means nothing if we couldn’t beat the cardinals . They dominated us & out coached us . Cowboys will be one & done . Another year of no Super Bowl
2 flags came late back to back aka the refs were tryna keep it a close game aka nfl is rigged to an extent, theres no denying it
It looked like Shannon suckered Skip again!!🤣
Budda Baker trying to bring down Dak: "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...."
How 'Bout Them Cowboys!!! Nuff Said!
Cards make their opposition look like their running with 10 lb. leg weights on.
I was saying two years ago that Dak wasn't going to get you there. The difference in this game was the QBs, one team had a real one.
I'm a cowboys fan: no matter how talented your roster is if you don't have a good coach you will always be one step behind. The penalties and miscues r of proof of that.
I'm glad Dallas lost!! Dak Prescott can go screw his little Ewok Elliot!!
Ezekiel Elliot will spring back to life against the Eagles which will mislead Cowboys fans into believing that he will show up in the playoffs but he won’t.
I'm guessing Mike McCarthy didn't ask Santa to give him enough insight to throw a challenge flag or control the clock.
After watching the screwjob today in Cincinnati... i was watching these highlights and seen about 200 penalties during it.... these guys were touching other recievers, even lookin at em... tackling and pulling players down while they were in bounds... 3rd downs not being converted, that an automatic PI on the defense ya know.. 🙄.... (sarcasm)... congrats to the cardinals... they had a rough skid and need to win a big game. 👍
Can't believe they thought they were gonna take down the cards. STOP THAT HYPE TRAIN.     Red Sea
I’m a cowboys fan to heart but this team is not going to win no Super Bowl, they don’t make halftime adjustments and Dak don’t just take what their giving him he always want to go down field they play off of lamb and coop take the button hook route and make them come up then go deep and they  don’t use pollard enough on the outside runs this offense is suspect it done happen to many games the same crap kellen Moore need to call Jason Garrett and ask how to make halftime adjustments because Jason was good at that , feel bad for the defense we might be out in the first round if we don’t make some changes offensively .SMH damn shame.
Cowboys looking so strong this year! Up by 2 games in that juggernaut of a division! How bout them boys! Even if they don't win a playoff game for another year, they are still the best!
Cowboys can beat bad team but never good teams.
Dallas is back Dallas is back put 56 points on Washington Dallas is back then lose to a much better team
Cowboy's are in serious trouble come the playoffs!!!!!!! DAK needs to do better.......Slump, what slump!!!! Ask Dak!!!!!
Jesus loves you !
Sorry Kellen Moore and the Cowboys didn't even make the playoffs Last year and this dude gets a head Coaching interview ? Call B.S. when you see it ! ! Plenty of deserving guys like Demeco Ryans Raheem Morris Josh McDaniel . Dallas Offense a Damn Hand Clapping Joke
Means nothing. The whole 1st string should have sat. Next week definitely
The Cardinals pulled this off and it really makes a statement.
People were saying that the  cowboys were going to beat the cardinals the cardinals beat the cowboys
Dallas is a Joke. Kind of like saying Cincinnati @13 and 0, is a 4 ranked division 1 team. Sorry Cinni, showed they didnt belong rank 4th, as the Cowboys are not Superbowl contender. This will be their first playoff since 2018! Unfortunately this team can't beat any teams with a winnig record. They will be out, as tradition cowboys have over the last 26 years have prevailed. Out in the first round of playoffs. Hopes dash again, 27 years with no Superbowl appearance! They are no longer Americas team. You cant win Superbowl with a poor QB. Murray purely out played Dax. Murrey is the different between a complete player! Verse Dax, a hyped by the sports media as being a complete player. Sorry Dallas fans, Dallas is missing the key component to winning. That would be a QB!
I Love It I Love It I Love IT! - Molly Shannon (SNL)
Jerry Jones should go get Aaron Rodgers and cut Dak.
How can you get clobbered by the stinking lions and then turnaround and beat a team who just won 56 14?????
Cowboys can’t beat good teams because Dak is average at best.
Hopefully dallas can cook some bird next week, LETS GO 49ERS!! P.S. the cardinals are frauds.
Skip gonna be crying tomorrow 🤣good game cowboys but HOW BOUT THEM CARDINALS LETS GOOOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥that fake punt catch probably the best catch all year
COWBOYS WILL WIN IN THE PLAYOFFS. WATCH! COME BACK TO THIS COMMENT AFTER FEBRUARY!
Oh man *snaps finger*
Us Cowboys fans better hope there are a bunch of sub .500 teams for us to play in the playoffs
Way too many pass interference calls in this game. On both teams.
Dallas got robbed and mccarthy needs to be fired his clock management is so bad
F****** !!!!
Boys have been in way too many dog fights this year. Hard to make a playoff run with a bunch of busted players
Dak sucks.  Let the excuses begin.  He is straight trash.  Cowboys 1 and done
Refs
3 wrong calls by the ref in the last minutes, good job.
Cómo aficionado de los vaqueros les pido a los dueños, jugadores , que hagan algo radical encontra de los disque árbitros o la liga ,por que no es posible que siempre nos perjudiquen de esta manera tan aberrante y asquerosa ,no hay partido que los asquerosos estos siempre marquen algo encontra de los vaqueros y a los otros equipos nada ,ya basta no más 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Dallas was never gonna beat Arizona and that lose for Dallas just shows their not good against top tier teams
It's not a cowboys game if greg zurlein misses a field goal
Thanks Refs for being garbage AGAIN
Many said last week Cowboys were the most dangerous at home. What's the story this week?
Kyler Murray owns Texas more than The boys and the Texans
Refs win The refs win!
Wow, Elliot is really earning his contract, huh?  What's he averaging?  45 yards a game? Good calculation, Jerry J.
‼️RISE UP RED SEA‼️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Thx cardinals!!!! from an Eagle's fan💪🏾!!!!
Lol this is what happens when the Cowboys play ACTUAL NFL teams.
Same old dallas
The sky is brighter, and the air breaths clearer here in Dallas. I wonder why. 🤣
You have elliot and pollard and you call 38 pass- plays ? What a jerk is cowboys OC
Guess I have to go back to my view in week 8 that the Cowboys got there 11 wins from easy competition there hardest was the Patriots . Like if they beat the Cardinals they would be legit but nope.
Saints still alive baby!!
How bout them Cowboys! 🤣 The NFC East Scrub division champs. 🏆
I just hope we don't get eliminated first round at this point🤷‍♂️
Its ashame with all that talent the cowboys are just a regular team
Dak is a fraud
Cards are still gonna lose it too the Rams for playoffs
Murray is undefeated every game he’s played at the at&t stadium since high school days.
Vegas need to put up bet on if Dak would ever lead the cowboys to a championship,cause I would everything on no
We will keep it simple ….      The Cowboys BAAAA HAHAHAHA 🤣😂🤣
As long as we don’t play like this in the playoffs I’ll be ok but this was not a good game for the cowboys
Cowboys ain’t going to win since 1996
Cowboys play an average team and suddenly flake. Trash
I’m a cowboy fan but this team is not ready for the big boys I think. Play calling is suspect. I never been sold on Dak. He wanted all that money, now he needs to deliver! Everything can’t be perfect for him to succeed, alas Baker Mayfield!!
Fly Eagles Fly!!! 🦅🦅🦅
It really is weird that with one loss, people jump on the bandwagon of, “They’re frauds.” At the same time though, we missed a field goal, penalties costed us, timeout management, and Dak wasn’t up to par with his passes, and his receivers weren’t catching the football. I’m scared for the playoffs, even though we are 4th seed guaranteed. Almost like losing 2nd seed was a good thing….
Cowboys choke went it's a real team playing them. I was hoping for a w they need to be more aggressive
Buckle up for next week cards fans, we all know how those games vs. Seattle can go.
Lol the cowboys lost to a bunch of practice squad corners
Dak be doing too much at the line like he makes everybody think too much and that's why they struggle
Dalls is terrible against competitive teams lmaoo they one an done in da playoffs😭😭😭😭
Why don't they have a sky judge when I know more than those refs. Honestly. Btw I was rooting for the Cards to win, but that wasn't a victory, it was highway robbery
The last game the Cowboys won as underdogs and they had no business winning was against the Saints in 2018. Can't hope for more with this average overpaid QB.
Sorry Cowgirls cant play the Washington football team every Sunday !!!
Lmfaoooo alll themm cowboy fans that assured a winnnn suckkkk thisss Dddddddddd
DALLAS IS ONLY GOOD BECAUSE THEIR DIVISION IS BAD
This is what we get for 75 million, where the laughing stock of the league
So do we just forget about that GREAT catch on the fake punt 🤔
See what happens when u miss FGs
The king of dallas
Do the cowboys still have a chance to go to the playoffs? Who they gotta beat next?
I just don't see how we're playing so inconsistently. We crush teams with terrible records, but when it comes to teams with an above .500 record, it's like we lose our confidence or something.
Every year the Cowboys are going to the Superbowl 🤣
Dallas is NOT going anywhere until they establish a consistent run game. 1995 and counting.
Okay the “number one offense in the nfl” caught me off guard Bc BS💀
That was a fumble by edmunds
Ha!🤣
How about them cowboys? Same story as last year they just can't win big games ...
The Cardinals is a better team so they deserve to win this game.
Best thing about this game was the mac n cheese I made for my kids during that garbage. So delicious!!!!
That's why you don't burn timeouts in case you need to challenge or set up your team for a game tying or winning FG...but apparently coaches who get paid the big bucks dont know that.
Cowboys went on a 21-3 run that nearly won them the game. Cardinals as well as the other teams in the league that might face them in the playoffs need to tighten up.
I'm so tired of Dallas's below mediocre offense. I hope we can get it together before playoffs. Now we got Philly in Philly and the Eagles need to win to get in so they're coming hard at us.
This is equivalent to the Packers going on a short week against the Cards when they were missing many of their starters. Cards were missing two of their corners their best defensive players and some of their best offensive players in Connors and Rondae (plus D hopps  is out for the season and JJ Watt). Yet they still won and they were in cruise control most of the game. They will probably meet in the 1st round I don't expect a different outcome. Cards should have a lot of their key players back for that one.
All i have to say for the cowgirls 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was the fumble even shown in the highlights.  The refs are not even hiding the fact they have money on these games. Refs need to start being fined just like players when they make bad calls.  What ever happened to let it play out and go to reply if it's has a chance to change the outcome.
Seems like when the cowboys actually play a good team they seem to break somehow. I can see the cowboys winning the NFC in like 2 or 3 years
Dallas cannot beat a 10-win team! Ya'll still Dem Boyz or naw?! 😳
The Cowlboys are going nowhere in the playoffs.  Their coach should be fired with the amount of talent they have.  They only beat average or weaker teams. Jerry Jones at his best.  Jimmy Johnson knew this and got the hell out.
lmfaoooooooooooooooo thought yall was some great team beatin up on Mike Glennon and Taysom Hill lmfaoooo BTW Diggs has now given up over 1000 passing yards on the season, most in the NFL. can't wait until you pay him 130m and his interceptions drop to league average.
It's crazy how a 40 million dollar a year qb is actually a liability .... Dak "mediocre" prescott
Cowgirls being the dam Cowgirls can win a freakin game against a team missing key defenders WTF !!!
Punter Bryan Anger desperately keeping cowboys in the game 😭😭
ROOTING FROM ALASKA LET'S GO ARIZONA CARDINALS
Dak is throwing to the mole people on the ground
Fix was in. Clear as day.  Could see it all the way from Germany
Cowboy lost again 😲😲😲
EasY WiN CowBoYS 🤡
There was no excuse about this game we're not ready for the playoffs not alone the super bowl I'm so pissed we need to push harder COME ON COWBOYS 😫😩
Sad
Man we just blew the game away. This should have been a cowboys W
Cowboys need to beat the Cardinals or Rams in 2 weeks and then go on the road to Lambeau. Lmao. They’re done.
dallasvsrefs
Eh maybe next year doc
Win or lose cowboy fan for life
Straight non call on the delay of game and fumble
lmao this lost still wont humble cowboys & cowboys fans. cant wait until they go into playoffs just lose.
Good win for my squaw 💯 #azcardinals #flockgame ... AJ Green was a TD though if not too much air under the ball..no complaints at all after that.
Ok boys time to pack it up, with a mediocre, trash QB you guys are one done 4 SURE!!!!
Eh maybe next year
How many times did Joe Buck say “perfect”?
Cowboys = stick a fork in them. One and done at best in the playoffs. Another disappointment. A realistic cowboys fan.
Cowboys fans remember this is the cardinals
Damn guys I’m a cowboys fan and I’ve been saying this team isn’t ready just yet. But also anything can happen with a playoff road game home games never feel “home”
That was clearly a fumble, but honestly if you don’t get ahead of the cardinals in the beginning it was bound to happen. Waited too late to bounce back. I’m glad it ended this way. Not too mad considering we got screwed in the end. We need to always be ahead in the beginning.
I have been a cowboy fan for 40 plus years. Believe the trouble with Dallas beating good teams is their quarterback and their running back. Prescott looks unsure of himself at times misses throws that a first-year quarterback should not be missing. Ezekiel Elliott looks like his best days are behind him.
good god that the cardnals won cuase if the cowboys won i helper could of killed me
lmao on que the cowboys lost to a playoff team. loking good against beloe .500 teams.
Dallas hasn't proved they can win big games. They made a statement all right. Lol. You have to really beat a team like the Cardinals on the road but couldnt beat them without WR Hopkins at home. Hey Cowboy fans, 10 Penalties for 88 yards. And 17 Rushes for 45yrds. That's your problem. And McCarthy. .....
Hope Stephen A shows up Tomorrow morning! Cowboys lost!
Not gon lie it would’ve been different if the refs clearly saw that delay of game and fumble but the cowboys put themselves in some of that. Good game cards.
The worst officiating I have ever seen.
No sound from the sidelines this week from the cowboys 😔
Keep paying stupid money to guys like zeke and Dak this cowboy owner hasn’t got it right since jimmy! The will never win a championship with owner player mix!
Dallas proves again why it’s not “their year”
Cut greg. We lost today because of him, we lost to the bucs because of him, and we lost to the raiders because of him and the refs. We should be 14-2 or atleast 13-3. What a joke.
You had one job Dallas.
Fact: Cowboys look awful against Elite QBs but look good against bad QBs
It’s funny because all week all i’ve been hearing is that this was a statement game for the Cowboys. Well, I think the statement is blatantly clear. Dallas can’t beat teams over .500.
I know Dallas made a lot of mistakes today, but the no-call fumble with 2 minutes left was bullsh_t. Refs could’ve easily reviewed that, but once again they cause the Cowboys to lose again. Also pls fire Greg Zuerlein.
Kyler played his off.  Congrats to both teams for making playoffs
Cardinals beat the Cowboys. Lions beat the Cardinals.   Therefore Lions > Cowboys.
fix your refs lol
It dont matter we didnt lose 3 straight games only worried bout the playoffs
Arizona cardinals vs Dallas cowboys 2021 Joe buck troy aikman erin Andrews
DAK PRESCOTT AND THE COWBOYS ARE HUGE FRAUDS!   STOP WITH THE SUPERBOWL TALK, IMMEDIATELY.
I feel like the cowboys are the Golden State warriors of the NFL, wayyyyy too much talent to lose even a single game in my opinion
I will say it again.... Dallas are fools gold... Cardinals are down several of their best players.. and they still win at Dallas..😂😂😂.. . Welcome to the NFC West!!!  Rams > Cowboys
The Cardinals are gonna carry this momentum onto the next game against Seattle. Kyler Murray has made plays after plays with his arm and feet
No fumble at the end?? Rigged.
Dallas can’t beat good teams the only reason there even in the playoffs is because there weak schedule an trash division they’ll be 1 an done in the playoffs….. FACTS
One and done cowboys came up short against a good team.       Again……
W
When you cant play teams like the Giants, Eagles, and WFT.. this is what its going to look like. Cowboys are frauds 😂
Reestablished emotional stability 😌  Yes I’m a Cardinal fan.
It always a good day when the cowboys lose
this hurt my heart.
The crooked refs get a nice bonus from Goodell when the assigned number of penalties against  Dallas is met.....
These cowboys haters need to shut up we still gone make it all the way
Missed field goal, mediocre play, and a bad officiating call puts the game away. "Number one offense in the NFL" is a joke. So disappointing.
The playoffs are gonna be epic this year, can’t wait!!
These Ref's are blind and trash smh
Isaiah Simmons made the biggest play of the game when he got the ball out
Jerry jones needs to do whatever it takes to trade for kyler murray, he doesn't lose in jerry world
As an Eagles Fan, GO CARDINALS!!! 💪🔥🤘And Go Zach Ertz!!! We miss you Ertz!!!
I'ma cowboys fan but we still can't beat anyone with a winning record
For the love of John Madden stop saying its a slump people we lose games we win games we ain't in Madden or Retro Bowl we could lose a game we still going to playoffs just hope we win next week
Can't wait for Stephen A Smith 🤣
The Dallas offense has once again come out very anemic to start the game. Their 3rd down conversion rate was low, but they were perfect on 4th down. Dak Prescott is still off target on his throws, but the thing that worries me is the playcalling of Mike McCarthy and Kellen Moore
Cardinals bounced back. Cowgirls fell short. Both teams are good but I don’t see them as a threat in the NFC playoffs.
Just saying that was a fumble at the end of the game and there was also a delay of game
Cowboy fans really thought this was gonna be a free dub 🤣
Well, the Cowboys have come back down to earth. 😤😡
Third game this year we lose cause of Greg the wide left leg and penalties. I swear Greg cant play a clean game against good Teams.
NFC east is the worst division In the league, this is what happens when the overated cowfrauds finnaly play a good team for once
Same old Dallas bullshit
Cowboy Stephen A bout to turn up
Cards needed this badly, now just need to ride the momentum into next week and finish strongly💪
Never seen more blind refs on that fumble
Zeke needs to go … he’s a bum
How bout them cowgirls.
1:48 the bass boosted mic is truly 👌
Early💯
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!!!
How does that humble pie taste this week, Cowboys fans? 🤡
Skip Clueless calling off tomorrow
America has, as a people, through their elected and appointed representatives, said to Christ, “Go away. We would not have you rule over us.” The shambles of a civilization that we are looking to pass on to our grandchildren are therefore a shambles created by the godless, for the godless. And what is the destiny of any town, nation, culture, or civilization that rejects Christ? What is their future?
Cowboys are 6-5 vs the Non NFC East Teams of the NFL. They aren't going anywhere in the playoffs
If Mike McCarthy would be givin  cheeseburgers to make smart decisions, we would've still had timeouts to challenge the fumble
It’s scripted…. Bet the unexpected hella people lossed bets (money) that the cowboys was supposed to win, they make it look real playing hard to win but cowboys sold by the nfl. Corrupted asf 🤦🏽‍♂️but like I said bet the unexpected cowboys go to the super bowl 🏆
5-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION DALLAS COWBOYS SUFFERED THEIR HEARTBREAKING LOSS TO SUPER BOWL XLIII RUNNER-UP ARIZONA CARDINALS
Dallas offense giving up as always
We're those cowboys fan huh? 🤣😂
Cowboys said they were going to destroy the cards💀. We had key guys out too.Murray is now 8-0 in that stadium 😎. Hopefully this humbles y’all cowboys who were cocky
Tough W
A much needed win for the Cardinals. How bout them Cowboys?!
Mfs swore cards would get rolled just cuz Dallas destroyed Washington 😭😭😭
Kyler Murray proves yet again why he's a probowler over Matthew Stafford. Baller
Go Cardinals!!!
Cowboys can’t handle big time teams, 1st round exit confirmed
PACKWATCH L BOZOS YALL SO ASS KYLER OWNS YALL
Cards going to be 12-5
L
What a controversial ending the refs screwed us from that fumble why well because it was a fumble these refs are so trash
Cowboys, how do you blowout Washington last week to this????
Cowboys can't beat anyone good, only beating the weak.
Dallas got mini curbed stomped
Cowboys: Manchester United!  Cardinals: AS Roma!
The Cowboys lose once again because of a missed field goal on the early stages of the game.
First
