Kyo has been my oshi since the day he debut till the day he graduated TT
aia tried to warn you  tried
I’ll never forget this day KYO❤😢
Wahh.. i remember how excited i was back then when i saw this because they seemed so interesting- but i never really watched anyone of them, just kyo and aster a little- but i will surely miss kyo who is graduating now
何で今おすすめに出すかなYouTube！！！！鬼かよ、、、 ILUNA FOREVER❤‍🩹💙💜🤍❤💚
Actually sobbing rn
I love ILUNA 😭
Been a year: Ren: F boy laugh, But A Really positive emo man Aia: HELL YEAH BROTHER! A dork, who is a weeb, former emo, and All around sweet, goofy girl. Maria: Super sweet and wholesome, great voice, but don't cross.  Kyo: AYO, Das Crazy! A chaotic, medically motivated, but really chill guy, whose friends with Enna. Aster; HEWWWO! A very CYUTE, feminine fellow, who despite looks, is a Very good gamer, and (NOT) a bottom. Scarle: Oh boy... My oshi... A Chaotic, All over the place emo girl, who is amazingly attractive, but also lives in a messy room, and gets takeout a lot... Older sister vibes.
The actual beginning of the downfall.

Aster seems like the type of person who reads omegaverse in public with a straight face, based on his tweets.
You can't tell me that Ren is not Malleus Draconia-
scarle🧎‍♀️🦋
I am exited but I wish their auditions lasted longer. I really want to try and join nijisanji.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Scarle reminds me of those villainesses in the isekai manhwas 💕
0:33 for... um dw about it

0:01 -  0:12 The instrument is really stuck in head. I'm sure this song gonna be another banger. STAN ILUNA <3
Only couple hours left! Gosh, I’m so excited!! I love all their interactions on Twitter, they all seem so nice and I love their theme and character designs. I’m looking so forward to their stream and their debut song!!!!!
I can feel Ren's tagline will be a new running joke for their group! "Looks like i have finally arrived" is as good as Fuuchans latest running joke, "you've.... Come" .

slayed
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DEBUT OMGGGGG
曲めっちゃ好みだしマリアとスカーレ好きすぎる 気になる
They somehow would fit as party members for a Tales of Game. Just imagine them in skits (Berseria style).
I wonder if nijisanji india has been reincarnated into iluna. that would be amazing!
Welcome to nijisanji en
Woahh
Daddy daddy daddy daddy  Mommy mommy mommy mommy

マリアちゃんめっちゃ声かわいいし、アスターくんの声もめっちゃ好き 制服なのかわかんないけど、学生服っぽいのめちゃ好みだから嬉しい 初配信楽しみ！
SCARLE????? 😳😳
Scarle looks very similar to sharla from xenoblade 1 And like sharla is my fav character in the game so maybe scarle will be my fav of this wave too
I WILL STEAL ASTER'S GENDER
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
めちゃ楽しみ…きょうくんって男なのね（） マリアちゃんの声めたかわ……みんなの声綺麗だしレンくんも楽しみやわあ……
0:26  Am i the only one who hear Project Melody from Aia Amare?
I new Mom has Descended
IM SIMPING
People’s reaction to Aia, before and after.  Before: Yes! Bully me!  After(Luca): Challenge accepted.   I’m having a feeling, that it’ll be the other way around lol. Chat teasing and bullying her like how everyone in NijiEn bullies Petra. Just a feeling. Maybe it’s cause I keep getting clips of Petra getting bullied in my recommendations and clips of how other Vtuber’s chat troll or bully them lol.
Let’s goooo But I'm going to school that day, and I may not be able to watch the live broadcast. I'm sorry.
AAAAGHGAHAGHAAAAAAAA OMFGGGG ASGHHHHGSGSYHAYSBS--

What’s EN ? Lexium?
We all should know how a Holy and righteous God sees us as sinners who break his law and that we will be judged by him.  Please read: [WHY WE NEED A SAVIOR:  Rom. 3:10-28  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.  They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:  Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:  Their feet are swift to shed blood:  Destruction and misery are in their ways:  And the way of peace have they not known:  There is no fear of God before their eyes.  Now we know that what things so ever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.  But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:  Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;  To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.  Where is boasting then?  It is excluded.  By what law?  Of works?  Nay: but by the law of faith.  Therefore we conclude that man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.  Rom. 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:]
もう既に音楽が好き
I missed the last wave's debut but I will not miss this one! Very excited!!
yugo終於有伴了
WHATAAAAAAATHE FUCCCCC I THROUGHT THERE WERE 5 GIRLS ONE GUY?? HE'S SO CUTEREEEEEEE AAAAAAAHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I'M CRYING WTFFFFWHXJDJD
Feel like they are all gonna be so chaotic... As in the horror and the raging games
Each group EN puts out makes me that much of a hopeless pansexual
I love how there's no gap between male and female in Ninisanji, it's awesome.
🤘Chaos? I call it fun! カオス？僕はそれを楽しいと言います！  ❤️‍🩹I'm a real girl now! 私は今、本物の女の子になれたよ！  💫It seems the stars have aligned 星が一直線に並んだようだ  👼You're awfully cute!  Makes me wanna bully you a little すっごい可愛い！ちょっとイジメたくなる  😈looks like I've finally arrived やっと来たか  💋I could use a little magic helper… 小さな魔法の助っ人が欲しいな…
Oh dang, I'm excited for Aia. As a fellow Vietnamese
What’s that supposed to be an animation or something
Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
БОЖЕБОЖЕБОЖЕ КАКИЕ ОНИ ЧУДЕСНЫЕСВААААЙЙЙЙЙБЧЗУЖ3ДЦЖХЫУЭВ
GAAH MY HEART
Nah this instrumental is telling me the songs gonna be a bop, I'm hyped!
Yaaay!! Looking forward to them :>
I'M SO EXCITED THEY ALL SEEM SO GREAT 😭
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Woah this comes out on my birthday

Came back here after finding out that Ren maybe aussie... my faves being luca & sonny .... Another one? 😭
HOLY FEESH
Epic 😎
Finally, now there is going to be 28 members of Nijisanji en
Why Scarle's voice reminds me to a famous Hungarian voice actress? She sounds awfully familiar to me...🤔
They got some rune factory vibes going on
The song already sounds like a banger 😭💖💖
I'm looking forward to seeing the six of them！！Welcome to NIJISANJI EN！！！
Letss gooo a mixed waveee
0:22
Yayyyyyyyyyy!!!! More vtubers to simp on ❤️
Cant wait bro- they sound amazing:0 and I’m especially excited for Maria, since i love chuunibyou characters
the alien guy has my attention
I’M NOT READY I’M NOT READY
Aster is my wifeeee😍😍😍😍
Gives fantasy, kpop vibes. I can tell that we'll be able to love and enjoy these new members' streams. welcome iluna!
We got a pop idol theme going around this group, which is completely different from the previous gens. Although, I can't help but point out that their character designs are similar to some characters that I know. No hate, I'm really excited to watch their debut streams.  My first impressions based on their opening dialogue and designs.  Kyo Kaneko: He looks like a cross between the Vocaloid, Utatane Piko, and a character from Hypnosis Mic. If he calls chaos "fun," he's gonna get along well with Selen, Luca, and maybe, Yugo, in terms of chaoticness. Hopefully, he isn't as dirty as the FEESH and the YABAI WITCH (Finana and Millie)  Maria Marionette: Bruh, her name is already a play on the name of Marie Antoinette right off the bat. A chuunibyou? A fan of Megumin or Fischl perhaps? Petra, Mysta, Pomu, and Alban would go along with her.  Aster Arcadia: He or she? The voice is throwing me off immensely. They look so SEISO and seem to have the calm onee-san vibe. Hopefully seiso. The design looks familiar but I can't pinpoint which character though. Might get along well with Reimu, Ike, and Uki.  Aia Amare: She looks like Dominique from Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night if she had white hair. She's gonna have a lot of fun bullying the NijiPet squad (Petra, Mysta, and Alban). She might get along with Enna, Shu, and, (probably) Elira.  Ren Zotto: That's Malleus (or Tsunotarou) from Twisted Wonderland if he had shorter hair and I can't unsee it. He gives me a vibe that is similar to Fulgur's, Sonny's, and Luca's: serious if things are actually serious, but an adorable goofball most of the time.  Scarle Yonagumi: She reminds me of the Barmaid from Identity V if she were a Genshin Impact character. I feel like that she is the leader of the group: the responsible big sister. Nina would adore her.  (This took me some time to analyze and comment. Anyway. GANBARE, ILUNA~~~~~!!!)
oooooh lesgoooo they're so pretty 😔👌💖💖💖💖
Compared to the new Holostars En group these designs are simple and  better
Can’t wait 😆
sheesh need to remember more names now-

It has a nice ring to it.   • aia: definitely gonna be the child of someone.  • ren: … I see where you was going with it.   • scarle: AHHHHHHHHHHGGhhHHH. that says enough.
WE FINALLY HAVE AN OFFICIAL GREEN GUY LMAO
Was not expecting the... adverse effects of Scarle's voice. Now I'm very excited for these debuts.
Omgomsgaonzhajanaj
I was actually not expecting this- but this will absolutely boost up nijisanji even more than before!! This will be awesome!
I really like the one with eye patch, she reminds me of rikka the chuuni Yes the nostalgia of having 8grade syndrome cringe at my self. And the guy with the horn look exactly like the mc of second life ranker manwha
Alright, predictions! Kyo: really positive during rage games Maria: will sing during debut Master: drops very interesting fun facts out of no where Aia: screams alot Ren: starts fights Scarle: will do banger ASMR  How'd I do, people from the future?
I wanna know their pronouns soon LMAO since I felt like one of em is tra– no ahem anyways excited to meet em!💕 Edit: damn I just realised noctyx are senpais now we've got pur 6th

I’m gonna die of excitement 😀
I vibe with the music. I can describe it as funky.
SUMMER VIBES SONG FOR SUMMER!
SIXTH WAVE POOOOGGG
Wow,  first group of girl and boy mixing in niji en!! Im very excited
ost where :0
Here are my comments about their voices, designs and overall: . . . . *Kyo* : I thought of a shota voice for some reason cuz i think it will fit well with the design... but after hearing the voice, i can say that it fits nicely :)  *Maria* : A chuunibyo character, nice... the cute imouto voice with a doll-like impression... double nice!! another NijiEn seiso 👀  *Aster* : i only thought of one thing for some reason... Ezreal from LoL... but nevertheless, he looks like the main character from a slice-of-life anime... the voice also fits in well IDK if it's male or female (Don't attack me, I won't deal with those shits) so no further comments but!  *Aia* : ...Huff... Huff... hufff... onee-san with glasses... ONEE-SAN WITH GLASSES!!!?!?! >-< 😳😳  *Ren* : Cool design... makes me think of a Fantasy Anime character with over lvl 100 stats 🙂🙂  *Scarle* : ...hmmm.... Gyaru Enchantress??? *DON'T MIND IF I DO* 😏😏 . . . . WTF DID I JUST WRITE AND DO 😀😀🙂🙂
celestial = 天の、空の、天体の、天国の(ような)、神々しい、絶妙な、こよなく美しい、素晴らしい celestial oneは天体少年ってことかな？ en男女混合はほんとに待ちわびてたからあと4日が待ちきれない！！

Ren😍😍
Yey new member of en
0:29 okay looks like im going to get married again bye
Okay, after spending far too much time meticulously reading all of their tweets, this is my prediction for their personalities:  Maria: Similar to Kyo, she acts like a chuunibyou, but is a real sweetheart. Out of all 6 members, I've noticed her supporting her fanartists the most (that's not to say the others don't, but she does it like she's competing for a prize). She seems to like being sweet and cutesy like Rosemi, but it would not shock me if she started dropping F-bombs.  Kyo: Is mischievous but a good guy at heart. He'll probably get along well with Alban.  Aia: The latest member of NijiYabai. Will be competing against Millie, Enna, and Finana in the Great Demonitization Speedrun. Acts dominant, and for the most part is, but the right person (Scarle) can turn her into a flustered mess.  Aster: ACTUALLY SEISO!? Seems genuinely sweet and kind. Is a bit of a flirt, but this is Nijisanji EN we're talking about here. Aia's favorite punching bag.  Scarle: Absolutely 100% the leader of this bunch of of lunatics and I will be taking no questions at this time. She is the only unbullyable member of the group. She is the hottest thing since fire and knows it, and doesn't hesitate to use that to her advantage. But she's also sweet and supportive. I expect she has a hidden berserk button and god help anyone who presses it.  Ren: ALSO ACTUALLY SEISO!? Aia was so bad I guess Staff-san decided they needed two seiso members to balance it out?? A really kind and supportive big brother type, but he's also a little bullyable which is why he's not the leader. Also another confirmed Australian!  I'm looking forward to all of these being confirmed wrong.  UPDATE: Kyo and Ren have both dropped F-bombs on Twitter and Maria has asked people to bark for her. Aster is the only Iluna member still in the running for NijiSeiso.
✨✨✨✨
We don’t need new members or new groups as much as the designs are beautiful. Please just focus on the members we already love so much, new songs new skins, events? There’s too many I can’t keep up

I’m really looking forward to ILUNA’s debut! I love that every NIJI EN groups have their own unique theme and I’m so excited to see them! The fact that this is a mixed group makes it all the more exciting! I love how they fit in so perfectly. Welcome to the family, ILUNA!! ✨
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU WATCH THIS TEASER😍😍😍😍
sorry but cringe
Ngl being known as the cheerful guy is sick knowing he hangs at the same reputation as aliens and sorcerers.
All of them are so cool and the music absolutely SELLS ME!   Aster has me by the neck tho- god what’s up with these star bois being so cool. Looking forward to their debut!!
y’all are shitting out niji EN groups every other month💀
There voices sound nice and and there designs look good. I can't wait to see them!
WHAT IF the men join uki’s harem  Omg Im so excited

AIA PLEASE BULLY ME
So excited for them! I love their designs and voices!
WOW ON MY BIRTHDAY
ayyy yoooooo!!!!!!
i’m really excited for the new nijien group! i didnt get to watch the other groups debut streams LIVE so this group might be my first time!
i am a lone mystake i bow down to the new pog members good luck and bye
I’m so excited 😃😃
the song is so lovley sounding, literally sounds like kpop
"I could use a magic little helper" This is it Millie. You're in. Didn't even need to flirt.
I have to say, Nijisanji En is one step ahead of Hololive EN, first EN vtuber boy group, and first mixed gender group.
Nice
THEYRE ALL SO GORGEOUSSSS
Ah! We finally get a mixed group! I can't wait to see Iluna come out, especially with the new debut song!!
たのしみ
I'm in love with their designs
epic
Oh my gosh new vtubers!! ❤️ I’m so excited<3 REN, KYO, AND SCARLES VOICES THO😍
have i been putting this video on loop?  …. …. m-mayhaps
Not try to start any drama but I honestly question whether their debut was planned later but was moved earlier to clash with upbringing of the new holostar group or not 🤔🤔 If you think about it, if ILUNA was introduced a bit after Holotempus was, and if they weren't, many people would stick to the idea of new holostars and we ALL KNOW that at first you may dislike a person in their debut cus of their design or voice but as you get to know them you'll make them your oshi :)))  This may be Njjisanji being very smart and risking an exposure of a new generation at the same time as Hololive so that there will be competition in who gains more attention and obviously this co-ed gen is special since no popular company as we know oh have tried it (not including jp)!! Very smartly played Nijisanji and if just coincidence still showing support for both Nijisanji and Holotempus ^^   Wouldn't this be fun for the 4chan fandom....  Otherwise I am LOVING thus co-ed gen!!!! Yuga finally gets a sister and Nina will never be given a break from newborns
They all sound so professional and divine in this, can't wait to see how many of them will be seiso/unseiso
Les go new members
OH GOD IM ASCENDING ADSJKKSHDJS IM SO EXCITEDDDD

Nijisanji always making a Meta, and they never fail.
Oohhh a mixed group, im very excited to see how this turns out

.how dare~~~ I still can't get over Voltaction and now there is already another group...??!! whoaaa.....   .ps. I love it tho.... lol
I NEED AN INHALER..
A mixed group?!?! Yesssssss
Is it just me or Iluna's theme is also kinda in line with Luxiem and Noctyx? Luxiem being light (Day) and Noctyx is dark (Night). Iluna with their soft pastel colour reminds me of Dawn, the time when Night turns to Day. I hope this means we gonna get a Dusk themed group next :D
OH SHIT ??
So excited!! This'll be my first time watching an entire group debut live!! Looking forward to meeting all these lovely people
I love how  No.  I love Niji EN
A mixed group for the first time, I'm hyped for this! C'mon calendar can you be a bit faster??

WAAAAAA
I'm sweating...I think I know what my new obsession will be
I- Noctyx? As senpai? What?
Ren: An Alien. Scarle: An Enchantress. Aster: A celestial. Aia: An angel. Maria: A living doll. Kyo: In trouble. Please save him.  Also, Aia is officially the first member of NijiWhite, and Maria is the first member of NijiPink (I think Rosemi's main colour is more red, despite her hair being pink)!!
This is so HYPE everyone looks so cool!!
I love this and also how it's a mixed group, can't wait for the debut also Aster looks so cute 😭🫶🫶
EXCITED!
OMGGG
They look so prettyyyy
UWOOOOGHHHHH CUNNY 😭😭😭

IM SO EXCITED!!
I AM SO EXCITED AHHHHH 🔥 literally wiggling as I watch this 😆 I really really can’t wait!!!
nice
AHH MORE???? Im so excited
I love their concept sm omg i can't wait!!!!
Omg yesterday I just thought of the next nijien group will be mixed gender and today god grant me a wish, thanks enna I believe in God now
My first impressions:  Song is pretty jazzy and poppy, I like it.  Kyo has feminine features but a masculine voice, I'm interested already.  I'm assuming Maria's eyepatch is removable.  Her voice is very cute.  I don't really have an opinion on Aster yet.  I will watch his debut stream to get a better idea.  Aia is either going to be the bully like Selen or BE the bullied like Petra.  When I heard Vox was a demon, I half-expected him to have horns very much like Ren's.  Oh, we have our first tanned/olive-skinned liver, Scarle!  Also, DAT VOICE.
OMG THIS GROUP IS SO CUTE 👀❤️
Mixed groups >>>
OOO pog!! I cant wait for their debut! I'm excited to meet evryone!!! I wish all of them good luck on their debut!
A mixed group? HELL YEAH I'M EXCITED NOW
0:08 will be my new religion

I'm glad we got more members to join! I wonder how much chaos they will cause for our entertainment!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

I can't count how many timesI have rewatched this. So excited !!!
Finally! I'm so excited right now, happy to know that it's a male and female mixed group :)
NijiEN's first gender-mixed wave. And it looks like Nijisanji wants to keep the balance, now at 13 apiece.

OMG!!! They look so cool!! I already love Kyo and Maria. But I really want to know more about all of them, I will be waiting their debut.🌈
Im always happy to see new Nijisanji members added to the group, but it always leaves a whole in my chest knowing that that's I place I'd love to be in but by the time I'm at that age to apply, the chances of a spot still being open are slim to none. Idk why im even writing this I just wanted to get it off my  chest because I've wanted to say this for a while.
REN ZOTTO I HAVE ROMANTIC FEELINGS FOR YOU

Woah nice design with those color pallets..
Based on Niji's counter part releases. I'd say that we probably have another group coming in the next few months.
Scarle has some strong Cattleya vibes.
LETSS GOOO BABYYYY!!!
sheeesh! and i thought Noctyx was the last group to debut last Feb or March, but Alban was right of not being the kouhai in Niji EN anymore, cause theres a new group coming to EN! I thought Alban was talking about being a senpai to VoltAction but he meant being a senpai to ILUNA!
what a wonderful day to be bi
I smell another Nina

Just the other day I was thinking Nijisanji should get more members, and now they are. I'm so happy and their designs are beautiful.
Something tells me Mika will be down bad for all of them but especially Aia and Scarle.
We have a myriad of colors here and music that somehow fits it. Although I'm about to sleep, damn, this woke me up.

SLAYYY MORE FAMILY MEMBERS FOR NIJISANJI-
the delusional doll says she's a real girl...
The NijiEN debut songs are yet to disappoint and I've been waiting for another one. The gap between waves has been twice as long as the others this time so here's hoping it's worth the wait!
I’m ngl they literally blew hololive out the water with the 2 debuts coming back to back the designs and concept of a mixed group seems so much better down to the designs literally everything is so much better
god why can’t hololive be on this level when it comes to male talents
うおおおおおお
WOWWW THIS IS SO COOL
TIME TO live this live as happy person look at them🥺🥺
i dont rly understand whats the big deal wow mixed groups and 6 members wow            like ok chill i see no difference tbh
Everyone looks good
I'M SO HYPEEDDDDD!!~+ TT
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG

AYO a mixed group?? POG!!   Also I’m already in love with Ren oop
thank you nijisanji for giving me bisexual panic
OK BUT ASTER!?!?!?
I know this is off-topic but dang Ren Zotto gives off Malleus vibes from TWST.
Wooooo!!!!😭😭
Hold on I’M NOT READY!!!!!! Wahhhhh
おめでとう！！
i love the way these groups become more diverse each wave fr! 💪
too much member in nijisanji
Maria Marionette: *is a Chuunibyou doll* Me after seeing the word doll: *immediately thinks of Shadows House* Also Maria Marionette: "I'm a real girl now." Me: *thinks of Pinocchio at first but immediately realizes that it's a line based on Poppy Playtime*
I've been praying that the next group might be a mix of girls and boys  Let's goooooo
Awesome!!!!! Let's Fraking Go!!!!! Looking forward towards their Debut
omgg I'm loving all of them!!! 💖😍

With the amount of Vtubers Nijisanji creates at such a rapid pace, it makes me uncomfortable wondering what they will do with the Vtubers that fall behind in popularity...
THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD AAAAAA
ASTER???? OMG
OMGHGGGGG ICAN T BRETAHE OMG
I love pastel And Goodluck On The New Members We Will be able waiting!!
Has white hair, glasses, and talks of bullying?(hopefully not the vicious as other kusogakis) Ngl that's top tier oshi quality right there.

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The tweet revealed it all🤣
WIWOOOF WOOF BARK ABRK ABRK WOOF WOOF WOOF BARK BAKR WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF BAARK ABRK BARK
Nijisanji at this point is just a Jpop company that just so happens to spawn Vtubers: You've jumpstarted more show careers in the last 12 months than your average label company probably does in 12 years.
WOAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
i take one look at kyo New oshi, right there    OKAY BUT SCARLE REMINDS ME OF LISA-
They look so gooddd!!!! Omggg
Kyo and Aster looks so cute! I can't wait for all of their debuts!!
YOO CANT WAITTT!! As someone who just got into Nijisanji EN and vtubers and just memorized all the names and voices, 6 more people to memorize? Oh god 😭
Very coincidental timing of this wave announcement if you follow the vtuber industry especially
Amare onee-san?
yayy coed genmates
Oh my gosh, stop, it feels so fast! They all seem really really nice, and the theme itself just feels all cozy and laid-back somehow. Can't wait, but Nijisanji's really making me feel old already!
Damn i'm so hype!!!
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Noctyx are finally senpai’s ☺️

Yoooooo a mixed gender generation??? And their debut is 1 to 2 days before my birthday???? Oh yeah, I got my gift I'm good 👍
Yo, I am fucking DIGGING these designs!  Although if they were going to go for alliterative names I wish they would have gone all the way
6 people LETS GO!!! Soon enough were gonna start getting 10 people at a time lol. Wish I could be in Nijisanji EN but I'm underage 😞. I have a feeling they won't be making too many debuts a few years from now... Since I technically have to be out of the house to stream (I am very loud if I could stream I would since I sort of have experience in something)
I LITERALLY JUMPED AROUND MY HOUSE SCREAMING THERE"S GONNA BE A NEW GROUP GGJHVRVV I'M SO EXCITED
The first EN mixed group with matching outfits from the start!!! NOICE!
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING

I’m going to faint Fr
OHHHHHh In the past I was hoping that the next wave would be at least an all male group again or mixed group....... AND MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT A MIXED GROUP IT IS!!!! IM SO EXCITED TO SEE THEIR DEBUT!!!
IM SO EXCITED AAAA I knew we were getting a mixed group soon!! Congrats Iluna!! Good luck debuting next week! ❤️❤️❤️
THE DESIGNS ARE GORGEOUS IM SO EXCITED !!!!
In my opinion, Niji is putting out way too many groups in EN is such a short amount of time. its been barely over a year since NijiEN and this is already the 6th group. I have no problem with it, but its gonna be just like how Luxiem got merch when it was Lazu's 1year, and it was better than Lazu's.
OMG
Looking forward to it!
OMG OMG OMG
