SHOULD I PLAY MORE!?
Technoblade never dies❤️
I needed to see minecraft youtubers + redstone
The look on Jimmys face when he put Minecraft and YouTube together and got money was just too good
Notice how he immediately gets a flower..... I'M STILL STUCK IN THIS DAMN FLOWER FOREST!!!
1:58
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
This is basically Doodle God but bigger
5:23 oh god timmy, i have a horrible headache but your making me laugh
Oh I love infinite craft!
my greatest accomplishment is getting "pumpkin spice zombie jesus weed"
Minecraft+Youtube=Money
:)
5:12 YouTube + Minecraft = Money
Minecraft youtubers and rainbow/unicorn could've gotten scott maybe??
when you combined Minecraft and YouTube i laughed and covered my face with my hands bc that's how i laugh and the i looked at the screen you had done the same witch made me laugh more
How did you get Smp im trying to get the Empire smp i got Empire but i dont have SMP
For some reason my infinitecraft is different then yours probably because we are on different devices but when I put minecraft youtubers and geyser together I get grian 😂 but when I put empire and minecraft youtubers I GET MUMBO JUMBO he isn't even in the empire Smp😂😂 another thing when I put tnt and mumbo jumbo together I get kaboom😂😂😂
this video made me realize you can get a LOT of things in infinite craft using minecraft
4:11 no, Steve is the name of one of the characters you get when you first start Minecraft
1:47 he has all the natural disasters what about landslide?
One thing (I think) he neglected to mention is that infinite craft is ai powered :3
i was losing it when he didnt add swamp to get joel even tho idk if its possible hahaha
1:04 the haha what was exactly my reaction to your thumbnail. 😒
So... Little Alchemy. EDIT: But seemingly AI powered.  I'm sure that's fine.
Me trying to figure out how he got half these words cuz I played this game for 4hrs 1 day and everything I found felt so very random
5:23 Minecraft money
You should’ve done minecraft YouTubers + TNT for Grian
“Optimus prime?!”
Minecraft YouTuber + clock should be Bdoubs
Barbecue makes hurricane 🌀
Fun fact fire nation is prestonplayz
Minecraft + youtube = money😂😂😂😂
1:00 the way he said barbecue 😭😭😭
7:17 😂
I 100000% know gem is on there
Fire nation is Prestonplayz
7:02 lol
MINECRAFT+YOUTUBE= MONAYYYYY
Minecraft YouTuber and drama but was so real
6:05 child and dream smp makes Tommy innit I think 🫢
Technoblade is Irish streamer plus Minecraft. It makes no sense.
Do Mumbo Jumbo plus smp and get hermitcraft
Its funny that he was more excited about getting mumbo than a first time discovery
Dream smp + pig = technoblade
7:52 missed opportunity for grian…
This is just Little Alchemy V2
I had over 1k words on infinite craft. But sadly I accidentally deleted the tap and It reseted for me.. 😭
"Barbeque + storm = hurricane, what??", it's Florida
love that hes wearing 3rd life merch
Play more and make affan
Yes, Techno with his cameras in pogtopia in the potato farm, Redstone engineering work.
BAR BE QUEUE
7:53 wisard=technoblade
1:31 RIP Technoblade you will be remembered
its ai that makes the answers 6:45 so, well, uhh, i cant spell out the pronunciation without saying the word “gay”. (gay-zur) 6:45 or guy-zur
I found mumbo jumbo zombie politics
Jimmy reminds me of Dennis Daily...
When I was playing infinite craft I somehow got one of the funniest things which was the great brexit brothel of the British empire 😂😂😂
6:25  CRAZYYY
but herobrine is a minecraft youtuber who got in the lore book no?
Mooooooore
I am commenting #BringBackDislikes on every unique YouTube video that I watch for the rest of 2024, regardless of if I actually dislike the video or not. This is video 1490.
Last time I played this I got "vote for pedro"... WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN-
Watching this in the hospital after being attacked by a dog on the face👍
dream smp and pig for techno i think and yes please play more
Don’t wanna brag, but I got a few first discoveries
you can mix to make funerererererererererrerererererererererererererrerererer I made it before
Do minecraft youtubers abd chimney maybe you get LDshadowLady
Adam and Eve? More like Adam and Stev-
Why is Technoblade a wolf!?
Smp+ a hermit would probably get hermit craft and you could get a lot of yts from that I’m guessing.
Now I want to check whether Minecraft + Moustache = Mumbo.
my favourite first discovery that i have is dinosaur-unicorn-spider-french Toast-man
Goldenglare
Make infinite next
I got LDShadowlady!
can we add mumbo jumbo to something and get grian?
My first original discovery is "the French simquisition"
Me literally yelling at the screen “PUT DREAM SMP AND PIG TOGETHER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD”
is this not just little alchemy??
Didn't this used to be an element/sciencr game?
money  :-D
would be kinda funny if minecraft + death = solidaritygaming
this is just little alchemy with extra steps
I got first discovery for Hardcore Minecraft from Hard Rock and Minecraft Youtubers. Still haven't managed any of the hermits. I'm very disappointed that Jelly and Minecraft Youtubers didn't get me Scar.
Mumbo + SMP?
Mumbo + parter or evil  or neighbour= grian
7:05 OMG JIMMY-  Im dying of laughter- literally- i CANT breathe
for some reason if you do tommyinnnit and lesbian you get tubbo
Mooore we want MOOOoORReEeEe!!
Barbecue and storm making hurricane... totally tracks given our hurricane parties.
his first thought for "pig" being technoblade is kinda sweet actually
Does anyone know how he got SMP?
Imagine is Minecraft YouTubers + Barbie = Solidarity due to the “Bad Guy” meme and the toy boxes XDD
6:35
6:09 no
6:09
Try to find bedtime and pancakes
Y’all I did this. I put Minecraft YouTuber and death together.. it made Techonoblade. RIP
Haha! i got bottle pope!
Steeeeeeeeeeve
When he got swamp I though he was gonna make a Codfather reference... : (
lens + minecraft youtuber makes lizzie
my man Mumbo, got me into YT minecraft
moooorreeee
Maybe if you put “toy” and “Minecraft YouTuber” together, you’ll get Solidarity Gaming 😆
I got first discovery subtwerkulator
“Human and Minecraft give me at least one YouTuber 🙂……….. STEEVVEEE 😏”
RIP techno
What would Minecraft YouTubers and Ken or Barbie get????
I was so hoping you'd combine 'drama' with Dream or Dream SMP 😭😭
This is so fun to watch, i'd love a part 2
7:07 too many options sorry pal
Whilst late to this video, upon attempting, I seem to have a common theme of greek mythology going on, with a bunch of random other things beside it xD This is kinda fun ^_^
Id assume youd need waffle for grian
Technoblade never dies :(
I made mumbo on a first craft ever🎉
Ay old branding finally back (late but)
Poppy + minecraft = flower husbands🤣
Adam + eve + steve canon?!??!??
Unicorn + gay +sassy =scott
is it just me or does he sound way more british in this video
Technoblade and redstone engineer?? Weird lol, fun video!
My friends and I do this as a race. The panic when someone says they're close is crazy.
Try Dream and romance. Idk I wanna get George
how did he get dream smp it isn't shown.
Gets TNT: Doesn't add it to YT minecrafters to get Grian.
YouTube + Minecraft = Money IS HILARIOUS
Minecraft Youtubers + Toy...?
you need to put YouTubers and Woody and it would show Solidarity lol
i would just like to say that I discovered 'Super Smurf Jesus Bros.' so there
Minecraft YouTuber + Pig
That’s cool that he got a first time discovery
Minecraft youtubers + SMP = Drama has been proven about 7 times this week
Flower, eh jimmy?
If you combine "Gambling" and "Hell" it makes Las Vegas 💀💀
2:05
you should try to get empires, life series, hermitcraft, etc.
More!
I got Michael Jackson from moon walk and black hole.
How do you get flash engine
Just try combining fire with mumbo jumbo and hopefully Grian will appear
hippopotashunami might be my new fav word 🤣
I think of you did it again, mixing stuff with mumbo might help finding other youtubers that hes associated with
Adobe are mud-bricks
Minecraft YouTubers plus drama = *Limited Life*
Minecraft Youubers + Redstone = Technoblade  the greatest Redstone youtuber
Grian is probbably minecraft youtuber and explotion/ some type of distruction
MOREEeeee!
So Grian made the cut for the thumbnail, but not the cut of the video 😂😂😂
Yesss play more and I really like how you tried to find your Minecraft YouTube friends
Think combining Minecraft YouTuber and British could probably help a bit
Money Is my favorite youtuber
This reminds me of a game i used to play called Alchemy. It was very similar, but much more limited. This looks fun!
if i've learnt anything from Amsey it's that this game is completely random
Not gonna check rn but I hope Minecraft YouTubers + cat is Stampylonghead
Not gonna check rn but I hope Minecraft YouTubers + cat is Stampylonghead
Jimmy is a silly billy
I thought I saw you get TNT earlier in the video. You should put "Minecraft YouTubers" & "TNT" together and see if you get Grian. Lol
Minecraft and YouTube. Who’s it gonna be? MONEY
Technoblade should come from dead orphan.
Can you do gatchatubers next time because I’m a gatchatuber
Minecraft Youtuber and Geyser should have gotten you Stressmonster 😂
You should try waffle + Minecraft YouTuber to get Grian
Imagine that mischief, and Minecraft YouTuber gave you grian 😂
Your videos are just you having fun and it makes it so much more enjoyable to watch
well the thumbnail is clickbait
7:32 Technoblade Neve' Dies!!!! Why redstone though?
minecraft youtubers & pig = techno?
Shouldn't grian be minecraft youtuber and tnt 😶
He never tried to make Joel😢
1:05 Clearly Jimmy's never been to a hurricane barbeque smh
you should race against other people to find specific words hahaha
natural disasters? completed it mate.
life+smp+youtubers? mby
Hmmm the thumbnail just changed from mumbo jumbo to grian 🤨🧐
Hol' up, the thumbnail said "Mumbo Jumbo" yesterday. Is there something you're not telling us??
moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Try cod and minecraft and see if you get grian lol
Minecraft, Youtubers and pig for techno blade
Clickbait!!!!!
The thumbnail changing from "Mumbo Jumbo" to "Grian" seems like a message
MORE
Long live technoblade! 🐽
What are the odds that if you combine Toy and Minecraft youtuber.......
Mumbo and friend maybe??
5:54 Probaby drug use and misogyny
I had to to step away after how I got Techno, and Jimmy got him in a  better way twice... This is fine 🙃
3:17 its a kind of house made with mud and bricks, we have a lot in the southwestern US
If we can get techno music….ad for YouTube music plays…
Lmao this is just a rip off of little alchemy
I have one thing to say and it is: Put this guy to hermitcraft
Infinite craft understood the assignment.
RIP Mumbo thumbnail
5:14  understandable
Sounds like a good game for a battle. You vs. Youre friends trying to find certain words faster.
Little big planet mentioned!!
Try mumbo-jumbo and smp
Sooooo fuuuuun🎉🎉🎉 MORE pls
Space and smp could have made boatem
Adobe is a building material, essentially Mud bricks
Try Mumbo Jumbo + SMP, Maybe you'll get Hermitcraft?
Is this game on steam or an App Store?
he just wants friends
Can u bring back phasmophobia ?
jim you should’ve done mumbo jumbo + smp too see what you’d get 😭
mincraft plus waffle = grian
Id do Mumbo Jumbo + SMP, maybe you get HC!
Try smp with mumbo jumbo
Did the thumbnail change I thought it said mumbo jumbo?
I’m glad people still talk about Technoblade
Why the thumbnail change?
mumbo jumbo not getting you enough views? lmfao
The game has dark mode. If you don’t like the bright white
i need to know what happens when you put minecraft youtuber and tnt together
I didn’t realize this until now but whoever cuts Jimmy’s hair did him dirty on the sides
I swear the thumbnail was Mumbo not Grian earlier      IT SAYS MUMBO AGAIN?!?!??! ive gone mad
4:25 steeeeeve😂😂😂 jimmy you never fail to make me laugh
BBQ and storm making hurricane makes sense- Floridians have Hurricane Parties sooo
1:00 BARBECUE 🍖 🇺🇸 🦅 🔥
at 6:40, the "geysir" plus Minecraft YouTuber is most likely a reference to the potato geyser in season 8 of hermit craft
by the time i got minecraft youtubers, i had already gotten hermit craft something else, so it was pretty easy to get hermitcraft. the hermits themselves are another whole thing, and i've yet to manage to get the life series or anything connected to it.
More plz
Minecraft youtubers with clock should give bdubs. If not i riot lol
Jimmy- "How does mud and brick make adobe" Me- "Oh, he doesn't know what adobe is." 3:17
The craziest thing is that i play this game often and yet. 2 mins in and I haven’t gotten some of these before
Hear me out: Captain America + Minecraft Youtuber = SolidarityGaming. I know it's not your skin anymore, but it was for a long time. Could be worth a shot
is no one gonna talk about how he got a poppy? 4:39
Unnecessarily, you could make weed if you wanted to. And there's no limits except for your imagination.          U could make a bong lol    Edit: yo can get God and Jesus and the Pope too
Microscope + beans = smallish beans?
MORE MORE MORE THE MERRIER👁👄👁
Jimmy once said: "How do mud and brick make adobe?" "STEEEEEEVE" "MONEY, JUST MONEY, MINECRAFT YOUTUBE MONEY"
Lol Minecraft + YouTube = Money
Hurricane and barbeque... its a florida thing. You wouldnt understand.
My favorite first discovery that I got was iron tea 589853
anyone knows how to make retro?
You think 1 first discovery is impressive? I HAVE 121! Mostly from Ultra Buddha Necrozma.
This is a guess - Mumbo Jumbo+SMP = Hermitcraft  Does this work ?
Changed it from jumbo to grain
you should try mumbo jumbo + smp
Anyone remember playing a game just like this in school? It was called alchemy or alchemist something. It wasn’t infinite though
I feel if we were to do Minecraft youtubers and Farming we'd find FWhip
I have got Grian before! Its Minecraft youtuber + glass or + goblin slayer (for some reason)  How did he craft SMP? Im trying to get the empiressmp or hermitcraft
Meh, but I like your face.
You can try and get Dan
i got taylor swift one time
I can’t believe Mumbo wasn’t redstone and Minecraft YouTubers. I know he’s far from the best redstone YouTuber, but he’s definitely the most popular
Still trying to find Grian :/ can anyone do it
fun fact if you put technoblade with father you get philza :,)
This challenge must be impossible for you
Mumbo plus SMP might get you hermitcraft
Find jimmy's dream house
Late+minecraft=Grain
Fun!
Guys, literally yesterday I was looking for someone I like playing infinite craft I couldn’t find anyone I I checked YouTube today and here it is😂😂
MUMBO × SMP -> HERMITCRAFT -> EVERYONE ELSE
PLAY MORE       please join hermitcraft🥹
3:18 Adobe (the product) is named after a style of construction (also called adobe) that uses mud and bricks. It's cheap, but efficient, and (if some of the survival games I play are to be believed) it is relatively good at keeping the interior cool.
When you got to the hippo part I was literally crying I was laughing so hard 😂
nobody when they get mumbo jimmy when he gets mumbo "MUMBO JUMBO"
The.biggest question i had is if mumbo jumbo & smp would've given you hermitcraft
1:51 “Scott and the unicorn” 💀😭
I already saw someone making Grian by accident. Sadly he didn't know him :/
I was suprised he didnt get "Die" as "First Discovery"
7:06 You can't add them because Infinite Craft knows it's redundant.  (Ignore the fact you can add the same thing to itself.)
It warms my heart that your first goal was to find Techno.
That was cool. I thought I saw Nessie's name for a second there
Try with gold for skydoesminecraft
I started playing Infinite Craft with the goal of getting a first discovery, then pushing that as far as I could.  I finished with Darth Coffee Toast Unicorn Sponge and Admiral Ackbar Cat Vader Frappuccino.  Infinite Craft is weird.
You can quite easily find yourself. I found you.
you sould try to put the unicorn and minecraft youtubers together,?
Did, did he not know fire nation was likely for PrestonPlayz?
jimmy try to find dendrochronology #best word
ive never seen someone be so excited about mud
I would love to see more Tim! Maybe you can try and find Martyn? He has been trying for AGES!
Ohhh- I remember the og version of this game! Little alchemy was so fun when I was a kid! 🔥✨
Yay
Game seems like a knockoff of the mobile app game Little Alchemy. Still looks fun.
I PLAYED THIS AND FOUND GRAIN AND LIZZY!!!
Someone please mix Minecraft YouTubers with TNT and tell me if the result is Grian lol
i leek the ken picture  more
Keep up the good work jimmy!! This video was awesome
I mean, 6:09 fire nation is the group name of Preston plays, and he is kinda a Minecraft YouTuber
I wonder if Minecraft Youtuber and Fish would give Grian? Or instead of fish, bread? Or waffle?
Hour glass is a YouTuber
I’m sure that Hermit Crab + SMP would make HermitCraft I have not tested it just a guess
Hm
What is infinite craft cause like I know little alchemy but I ain't ever heard of that
1:50 love how he thought of Scott for the unicorn 🦄
I wonder would Minecraft YouTubers + fish get you grian?
Mud + swamp = mogswamp
Timmys the only one I've seen actually be able to get Technoblade, congrats JIm
So it’s like little alchemy but with infinite possibilities
Yesss
YESSSSS i've been waiting for this!! I was wondering if you combine crown with smp, can we get empires? 🤔
👁👄👁-sTeEeEeEeEvVvVeEeEe
I feel like this game just appeared out of nowhere and now everyone is obsesse with it (including me)
Minecraft Youtubers in space really should have just went into "moon big" and that would have made my night lmao which could be easy at this point because I'm bloddy fuddin sick and it's my birthday on Thursday and even if I'm better by then I got the dang kids who still need to be reminded to drink water and wash their damn hands 😂 I put bloody covid masks on them lol. I was sick AFTER them and I have nothing but a sneeze now and I'm drinking wine. Why are these children still needing medicine every 5 hours and MORE DAYS OFF SCHOOL? They've been home since Thursday night. I'm getting stir crazy here. A little cabin fever. Did somebidy contaminate thr water resevoir?  😂 Sorry going off on a little horror movie tangent here. All in the name of the game.  I'll see myself out. See you again when I'm a year older.
6:20 Nah Jimmy, it's pronounced geezer cuz Mumbo is an OG MCYTer 😂
Jimmy your reactions are so wholesome 😂 oh you are the absolute best
Omg yes also Jimmy where Mickey mouse and piochoco??? Lol I was on the stream ofc
The way u were like “hmm Minecraft and drama doesn’t go together hmm” kinda true tho! Lol! U should try make Grian next! Great vid!
Oh man im SO curious if Mumbo + SMP would get Hermitcraft 👀👀if it did I feel like that could unlock so much
Oh my sweet summer Jimmy. Scott is NOT a unicorn 😂 you'd want to look at your bi-open-poly friends for that label lol
What in the frizzlefrack is a barbecane? Sounds Australian. There's your link to Pearl.
Why didn't you combine Mumbo or Mumbo Jumbo and SMP?
We want more! More! MOOOOORRREE !
BBQ + BOUQUET = WILTED BOUQUET AND YOU BREAK UP WITH A VILLAGER, Sheesh does this game even Stardew Valley? 😂  This reminds me a little bit of Scribblenauts and that Genie game my kids love watching Frustrated Gamer play lol
When I heard him go we could meet technoblade I smiled so much😊
i started playing this and somehow managed to get 'captain hook and the pandacamonium' and it was a first discovery
swamp + human = shrek ?  shrek + minecraft youtubers = Smallishbeans ? Maybe???
He is such a ken
If you can't put Minecraft Youtubers with Rainbow and get Scott, it's broken.
techno💕
Its actually called “my little alchemy” this is a ripoff, u should definitely try the original, it has some cool stuff in it
Life + smp = life series smp
4:27 Steeeeeeve! LOL
3:18 "how do mud and brick make adobe?" You are a muppet! Adobe houses....common in Mexico and the Southwestern United States
Me who totally hasn't spent the last HOUR trying to find Pearl and G
Ah yes "money" the most famous minecraft youtuber to ever exist
If canary + minecraft youtubers = Jimmy  i will actually get a good nights sleep for once.           That is a threat
i was shouting UNICORN AND MINECRAFT YOUTUBER
Jimmy my guess is to get grian you need bread and Minecraft youtubers
:0
Barby-cue that is correct lol
You should try and find all the life series members Jimmy
nothing will ever beat my first discoveries of the were-tree-wolf-tree-wolf-tree-sharkpig-surfur and skarknado 2427906
I straight up yelled LittleBigPlanet when i saw it! The game is so underrated and is being neglected by whoever has the rights to the game
You should try Minecraft Youtubers and Sun... that should get Grian because Grian means sun in the Irish language!  :)
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
0:57 "Barbie queue"
You should try to get *Grian* and *Late* and then see if you can combine them!
it might just be me but the video is slightly out of sync
❤ fun 😂
I watched you do this live as well!!
I think you should try combining 'redstone' with 'Minecraft Youtubers'
I really felt the accent with this one 😂
youve heard of sharknado... but have you heard of hippopotashunami?
Once you found minecraft youtubers, I thought that combining redstone and minecraft youtubers would get mumbo, so I was screaming that silently, but I was very wrong. Infinite Craft makes no sense!
Technoblade never dies
Make kanye west riding a boomerang into a hole you combine Kanye West riding a horse with boomerang to get Kanye West riding a boomerang and then Kanye West riding a boomerang plus black hole
I love how it isn't Pig that lead to TechnoBlade but Redstone Engineer 😆 He was very well known for his Redstone inventions like the Techno Hopper Clock, TechnoSV Shulker Box Loader, his various Farms, he could do it all except for maybe PvP bit rusty in that department  (All jokes aside I do miss TechnoBlade he's a Legend)
I got some really bad weird ones….. it was very delightful
Эм ну ладно...         ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨 ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
Why is Minecraft YouTubers + SMP = drama so accurate-
you should have added Mumbo and SMP and possibly get hermitcraft
I actualy tried that, "Zombie Cleo" is not as easy at it seems😂 Before that i got "zombiecraft" "Cleo de Grian" "zombiedocm77", "cleo zombie" and much more  Also.... Dog + hermicraft = grian Pearl hermit + moon = crab Hermicraft + clown= mumbo Hermicraft + looser = mumbo (Infinite craft hates mumbo i guess)
I love this game because it tells you some words can’t go together and then gives you hippopotash
Mumbo jumbo actually doesn’t refer to him, that’s actually a word with meaning
I love this
EARLY!?
3:19 For anyone who's interested (every day's a school day), adobe is a building material principally made out of mud. Adobe houses are typically associated with the Mojave Desert.
mumbo jumbo you are afkkkk
Out of all the spin off vids, I like this one 😆
3:02 Wonder what happens when you put  UNICORN  THE SUN  together?
i miss ken
So glad jimmy tried to get technoblade in infinite craft. Technoblade never dies!
yayy
How Minecraft and YouTube made MONEY 😂 that is so funny I’m screaming
Technoblade. My favourite redstone youtuber
In case you were wondering grian is Minecraft YouTuber + glass
Under 1 hour gang 👇
This was way more entertaining that I first expected, good vid!
There are some very dedicated people on r/hermitcraft trying to make all the hermits, apparently Gem and etho are proving to be difficult
JIMMY
2:13 Mildly concerned about how Jimmy's first thought when he got 'house' was to add fire
4:26 ,could make a great song lol
ETHO FOR THE ETHOGIRLIES⁉️⁉️ /hj
I tried to combine Minecraft with Australia to get an Aussie minecrafter like Pearl but then I get Australiacraft
1:48  what about mogswamp 2:06
This was actually incredibly entertaining- I knew I would enjoy the video, but I wasn’t expecting to burst out laughing multiple times lol  It would be fun if you did more, because you’re just genuinely funny and entertaining and it’s also interesting seeing your thought process when combining things <3
2:32 how!
minecraft youtuber + wizard = TechnoBlade  amen
🥓
This comment is pinned
Help none of those combinations make any sense 🥲🥲🥲
The way he said no to poppy playtime😭
😂
I betting, based on combinations during the stream, that Mumbo + Mumbo = Grian.
hearing jimmy even mention technoblade made me tear up oh my goodness 😢
Great vid after my netball tournament ( _I am in pain_ )
omg yesss I’ve been obsessed with this gameeee
Speaking of poppy playtime youtubers, will Jimmy also play that game someday?
I'm sure grian, Lizzie, Etho and Scar are on there! also try combining things with dream smp I think that'd be funny.
maybe superman + minecraft youtuber makes solidarity!
I WANT MORE
Real ones know how to craft Mickey Mouse.
I wonder how long it would take to get you
infinite craft + jimmy = chaos
Minecraft YouTubers + SMP = Drama ❤ yes correct very very true 😂
MINECRAFT + YOUTUBE = MONEY ‼️
ive spent so much time on infinitecraft its actually insane
‘BaRbUeqUe’
i have over 1000 things on infinite craft at this point. i havent got any mcyt yet. ITS SO TRICKY!!
SHOULD I PLAY MORE!?
2:05 Dont you just get annoyed when your neighbourhood just gets hippopotashunmani
Cool video, I’m addicted to this game, I have over 3400 items and over 300 first discoveries
I tried to get Mumbo the other day ...it didn't end well
hippopotamushunami?! (how on earth do I even spell that haha) this game does have quite some weird words. Great video Tim!!
Earlyish??
2:01 HIPPOPOTASHUNAMI!!!!
you are a sussy baka
OMG IM SO EARLYYYY
I have to stop commenting and actually watch the video now... This is the last one I promise.
Hippopotashunami
here before 5 mins gang  👇🏼             👇🏼
Nice!
Love the content jimmy!! I have really been enjoying the sos series and I wanted you to know that you are doing great ❤
Jimmy just randomly getting things that don’t even make sense when he tries to find his friends is just hilarious 😂
....great, now I need to see the full stream and see if you did get Technoblade.
2:06 new tounge twister unlocked
I'm very sick right now and now i have something to watch while rotting in bed.. thank you Jimothy !! ;3
