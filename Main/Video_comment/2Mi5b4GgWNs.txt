Essa está no cofre
Till date i didnt know they dropped this... FIRE 🔥
NICE!
pop definitely would've been bigger than drake . Drake didn't come in the game hot. Drake had build his way to the top. Top came in at the top , with ONE mixtape. N did more than rappers did in 10-20yrs. He's the only artist that's hot enough to not need a drake feature. He came hot and went straight to the top. Drake wasn't even tht great when he first dropping mixtapes , raps n all tht.
Saint Maximin  🦁🔥🇲🇫

I’m not really a fan of modern day artists but no rapper has had such an effect on me like Pop Smoke. I rate him so much more than the likes of Drake. It’s sad to see him gone so early but I have a feeling that another upcoming artist will take inspiration from Pop Smoke and forge a successful career.

RIP Woo💫
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I know that's young thug on the right 😂
Pop was on his way to being this gen’s Biggie! a massive loss felt worldwide RIP.. 🇬🇧
Woo in the building 💫💫

Popsmoke never misses
Funny how everyone used to moan about UK Hip-Hop sounding American and how Grime saved the UK's identity.... And now we got Fredo sounding yankee in every tune, but no g-checks from the young generation.
give young adz his flowers now, watch how all of his haters will big up him up in a few years time...
this is cold young adz amazing pop smoke done his part you man saying fredo sounded shit i think he sounded fire
Young adz carried everyone
Think this was meh tbh
It's too easy for young adz
That 3rd verse shoud have   been young adzs
This should be a music video more people need to hear this🔥🔥
"Smoking 🌬️💨🚬a Op, got me caughing " Fredo Man😂🙆🏾‍♂️🤧
THIS IS HARDDDD
How can a young adz and pop smoke feature song turn out so shit
You cannot say ludwig and forget van Beethoven
Another tune ruined by young adz
eee
Rest in peace Pop   Woo forever
Can’t lie this was dead
rip pop
Everybody came here for pop smoke nobody else.
Imagine if Fredo ft J Hus and POP SMOKE on a track 🥶
Adz ruined it can’t lie
Best album drop of 2021
Fredo you gotta stick to your straight talk
Did it for pop the smoke will never clear
Shoutout to Yoz and Rico for 🔥 beat
Watch how haka and nobu start putting metal detectors in there restaurants
This wasnt it 🥴
Fredo fits on this tune so perfectly 👌🏿
This is shit
Pop smoke would’ve taken over the UK
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
tha piano part at the end completed the song
young adz needs to hop off ffs. It sounds like his mum sent him out to go play with his brother and his friends. kmt
Did I just hear Pop Smoke say “Young Adz” ??😯😯
Young adz was dead on this it should of been fredo x pop smoke
How many bars did pop smoke do before he got popped geeeezzzeee

Shudda put r.i.p pop smoke!!!!
It’s shit ngl
This is so shit
Fruity Fred uno
Young adz again with a dead verse!! Go away bro

Could’ve been a better song but it was calm
Who else here before a mill

I can see a fredo and young ma collab soon!
This is such a dead song
came here to downvote
The mad thing is:  this is probs the weakest track on album
💫💫💫💔💔💔😭😭😭😭
May Allah have mercy on Pop Smoke
This is so bad  Fredo and auto tune did not go together Young adz is actually a fucking nitty wtf was that hook Pop smoke was aight but I feel like without that extra auto tune he woulda hit harder too  Plus why the beat sound like a dog panting 😂😂😂😂
Young adz ruined the song let’s be honest  (He definitely past his prime)
Woo💫
Ahlie this song brings a tear to my eye RIP POP SMOKE my 3 favourite artists on a track 🤩🤩🤩
YOUNG ADZ NARSEYYY DBE IS THE WAVE

Hard tune 💯💯💯
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Banging
Sounds like some backwards demonic music
RIP POP SMOKE NEW ALBUM IS 🥶
Young adz 🔥
Too much tune pop don’t need that shit
He said he going to take this shit serious he aint playing
I’m convinced people are forcing themselves to like this just because of the artists, it’s the worst song on the album
👀👀
make a music vid
i been waiting for this song with pop for so many months finally
Young adz should of dropped a verse but still ❄
Fredo is ridiiiculous
Don’t get me wrong pop smoke is hard and a legend but he did not sound good on this song🤷🏾‍♂️
Not as hard as it should’ve been, very basic song. They don’t sound good together 🤷🏻‍♂️
OMG the Collab
REST IN PEACE BIGG PAPI LOCSTA

I don't care what order this song is on the album I played this shi first
Pop really fire on the uk drill beats he so versatile
If your a Muslim lower your volume during Pop Smokes verse. It’s bringing him so much pain.
Not feeling the hook on this one at all, still loving the album tho

Money talks  One hour version on my channel had to make it since no one did ✅💯
This song’s ok but they overused that beep sound. Similarly to when they stole Southside’s sound for Whipping Excursion and used the f*** out of it. Ruins it for me.
RIP pop 🕊🕊💔
Young Adz needed a verse, the guy is too cold. The haters gonna fuck with him in few years till they understand what was going on and how many bangers man dropped in 2 years, insane 🥶🥶🥶
Still can’t believe mans was only 20 when he died. 20 yano. Gone too soon, we coulda been blessed with decades of drill bangers from the woo. But we only got a few. RIP Pop Smoke 💨💫
That piano though...

💎 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kinda disappointed still fredo and pop smoke should have allowed the auto tune
❄❄❄❄❤💯💯
WOO💫
Here before 20M views
All of them are hard but this song ain’t it lets not pretend
Pop can go on any vibe
this was so shit
ngl this sounds dead fredo didn't need autotune but its still alright
🔥🔥🔥
Heat but idk why Fredo used Autotune for the hook, he didn’t need it
Best combination ever
This could of been way better if it was straight Drill. Adz ruined it too, there’s no need for Autotune from either Fred or Adz 🤦🏾
Pop got smoked
Sick song they all sound sick
🏆‼️
Lawd Av mercy! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽💥💥🔥
"I do not play with no enemy cuz they tryna get rid of me" hit different😓
Three gangsters terrorized one beat🔥

Rest In Glory Pop Smoke
RIP THE WOO
Liked before I even listened to it
Pop smoke left too soon, R.I.P thank you for this track! Fredo, Young adz coming in too hard 💥
“All black feel like I’m in Gotham” 🦇💯
Young adz didnt have to be on this.
RIP WOO💫💫
Pop smoke really was the only US drill artist to show love to the UK that why he has such a big audience over here... his own people only fucked with him after he passed his first show to get sold out was in LONDON RIP THE WOO💔
Fam u man rate this shit 😬🤦🏽‍♂️
RIP Pop man the guy only made bangers 🙏
Fredo ft. Pop smoke couldve been way harder then this imo
I beg someone make an 8D Audio version...
fredo verse has too much auto tune, maybe it’ll grow on me, pop and adz did their things 🐐
omg
Fredo lowkey the worst thing about the tune. This ain’t really his vibe
Exactly what I expected shit
wtf is that random piano at the end 💀💀💀
Fredo with auto tune bangs differently
Popi chuloo....
Cant say pop without the smoke Woo 💫💫💫
smoke rip man😔😔
Punching the air knowing how many collabs pop smoke would’ve had in the uk 😖
Unpopular opinion: this tune had more potential
1m in 24 hours I’m calling  it 💯
Pop smoke is hard on every beat 🔥🔥
Rip pop smoke 😭❤️
🔥🔥🔥
In hakkasN or NoBU
pop smoke verse is the one ☝️
"Save the game with no Cape on" Fredo 🙏🙏💫
Dont lie to yourself this tune was underwhelming asf
If young adz is on it it bangs guarantees
Yeaaaa popp popp
Fredo should have took off the auto tune and wtf is that piano at the end ruined the entire song
Fredo auto tune not expected, bangs still
Fredo don’t miss! Album of the year 100
🥶🥶🥶
Autotune killed this song would have been way better without
Rip pop smoke 💔
Fredo and adz need a track of there own
Felt like Pop came down from heaven when them pianos came in at the end
Caribbean here🔥🔥🔥
Ight
RIP POP SMOKE 💫💫💫
Ngl fred was lackin on dis track
2:22 Thank me later
Lool jokeman Adz ruining the track to rass
Adz carried this so hard
Imagine pop and abra
W9
I know everyone been waiting for this one. Pop Smoke showed so much love to the uk scene and he got it back as well   RIP 🕊 gone way to soon
Chicago: this is Drill  New York: nah  London: let me add a little Carribbean twist to that fam  Canada: that's fire ey  Ireland: yea   Australia: yea   New York: yea I like that too
Hardest song in this fukin 2021
Rip Pop Smoke 💨🙏🏽
This is worse than Hickory Dickory fucking piano and autotune this is pure wank
Crazy collab 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💁‍♀️🆙🆙
fruity fred
Fredo(without auto tune) x Pop smoke would have been better ngl 🤷🏾‍♂️🔥
Ain’t feeling this one tbh
Fredo been doing bits lately icl 👀🔥
Wooow 🤯🤯🤯 (1second in)
Pop smoke was a so cold Mann
🔥🔥🔥
This trash af don’t lie
Pop Smoke the best artist we lost in the last year
Look at this line up 😍
Wish pops part was longer but song is cold asf. LLPS🕊💫
😐
They really said “fck it lets ass some meady garage band piano at the end of the tune for no reason” 💀
They all cold but this ain’t it
Never disappoints
Should have just been fredo x pop smoke tbh, not saying adz is shit, he could have got a separate track with fredo...but if pop smokes part was longer the Americans would have loved this shit, and fredo would get more recognition over there
RIP POP SMOKE man 💔💔but the long fredo and d block a life I don’t need no one else ❤️❤️
Why was fredo hiding hella heat from us dame
Is fredo‘s autotune not in key or am I tripping
How much did he pay for those 4 bars?
Rip the woo 💙
My face when i read the title “😮”
Adz needed a verse 😢 still cold though
Woo 💫
Pop smoke verse was too shorttttt 😩😩
This is by far his best song trust me I'd say Netflix and chill then definitely this ,keep it bro 🔥🔥🔥🤟
Sounds like a movie sound track. Definitely has a different sound to it aswell 👍🏾
Rip the W💫 💫
Pop kill it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My man was hard in dis track
Keep up the good work g☝🏽
Catchy
Man, this album is gonna be something👀
*"I DONT PLAY WITH NO ENEMY KUZ THEY TRY GET RID OF ME"*  *REST IN POWER POP SMOKE*

No offence but this is average at best . Not creative at all to what these 3 coulda done . Some weird theme to the song
Yoz Beatz! 👏👏👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥

People didn’t want Adz on this tune 😂🤦‍♂️
Rip Pop Smoke Still dropping bangers
Ahhhh man the auto tune ting
Last Fredo verse should’ve been young adz magic
