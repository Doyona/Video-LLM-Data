1:06   bro #9 move out the freakin way ! Idky u thought it was a good idea with 5 sec left on the clock to bring ur defender toward brown! Look if Jaylen Brown tells you to move out the way , that means move out the way! No questions asked! Listen to what Jaylen Brown tells you! If Jaylen Brown tells you to get on your knees, then you betta get on your knees! No questions asked! If Jaylen Brown tells you to bend over , then u betta bend tf over! No questions asked! If there’s 3 slices of pizzas left and Jaylen Brown wants all 3 slices, you betta give him all 3 slices! No questions asked! Whatever Jaylen Brown tells you to do you betta listen and do it ! Jaylen Brown is a veteran ! He’s been there longer than u! So he knows what he’s talking about. He also went to college I belive Cal Berkeley which is definitely a smart school ! Also I think Majored in like some MIT and graduated with a 5.0! So he definitely knows what he’s talking about! So if he tells you to sit corner, that means stay in the corner! Ur lucky he didn’t sucker punch u in the face like Draymond did to poole! Ur like 5’11 150 scrawny with no muscle. Jaylen Brown is 6’6 240 broad shoulders and nice chest! So u definitely don’t want to fight him either cuz he’ll whoop tf outta u! So again, if he tells u to move out the way! That’s means MOVE TF OUTTA DA WAY! 😂😂 Common sense! Let this be a warning cuz I’m sure if this happens again, Jaylen Brown might have to pull a Draymond to humble u some! Ight ? Gg u played decent
Bro curry is literally doing everything 😂💯💯
6:05 wasn't a foul, Curry pretty clearly leans forward to make contact with AL Horford. That's a no call
Hopefully one day us Celtics fans will be able to witness this atmosphere again
Warriors never looked back after this game😂😂
4:00 and 4:07
Hurry please 🎉I’m at my moms house 🏡 Christy
Little did we know that this would be Udoka’s last win as Celtics coach
Reminiscing on the good days 🥲☘️
Rewatching all the finals games
Celtics take lead who wins game 4
Nice game
They're 2 wins away from a title,....not anymore 😂😆
I love the Celtics' classic looking floor. 👌
Holy... LA
Thunder and caviler
Congrats gsw 2022 nba champs
The last win Boston got  during theae series 🤭🤭🤭
Oooo this 2 week old warriors salt is aging nicely
This game cost Celtics dubs hung around and wore them out next 3 games
This is a win in my Los
Love going back to comments like "Warriors are done", "Curry/Klay is washed", "Celtics in 5/6", "ain't no way GS is going to win another game". 😂  That's why it's called a seven game series.
after watching this. i got celtics in 9
if it wasn't for Steph Curry the season would've ended on a bitter note, im glad we got the good ending
Celtics could have won the whole thing 😞
After this the Celtics collapsed
Warriors champions last win they got 😂😂😂😂
Celtics in 7!!! oh waittt
And the celtics never won again😂😂😂
Who’s here after warriors won in 6 games😂
Celtics went up 2-1 and their fans had the series over in their minds, only to watch their team lose 3 in a row and 2 at home, it happens.
Where are you now Boston Caltex? I told you Boston is weak overrated told you...
Celtics are 1 season away from getting the champiobship 💀
Im willing to bet the warriors will win 3 in a row to win in 6😏
I am targeting all the trolls who are Boston Celtic fans.
Remember when the series was over after Game 3 and the Celtics were gonna win it all?
Where all them bum ass Boston fans FMVP bitch 4x rings
"They're 2 games away from a title" 😂😂😂
Golden State WARRIORS 103 vs 90 Boston CELTICS
Coming back to this video after the Warriors just won it in 6. Absolutely love seeing all the comments saying the Celtics are gonna win it all. It's over! You lose! Good day, sir!!
Y'all Celtics fans real quiet rn 😂😂
Go golden state
Wish Boston could do this on Thursday night in Massachusetts and tie up the series 3 apiece
Ang lupit ni curry. Road to championship

Boston CELTICS 94 vs 104 Golden State WARRIORS
Tatums a coward
Celtics  win In 7 The 🌎 knows that 💪 🏆
The Celtics are bipolar. They had this amazing game plan in game 3 only to change it up in game 4. The warriors can not stop them from getting into the paint, in this game they scored 52 points in the paint, in game 4 they scored 36 points in the paint...STOP SHOOTING 3s and just attack the damn rim 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
Dude warriors need to step up there defense skills….
When is game 5
Km. CNN
GO WARRIORS  YOU GOT THIS 😄
Crazy how warriors closed the gap. And than lost it lol
The @Celtics have to play their absolute best to beat the Warriors. No Mistakes. Not one.

2-2 Game 4
UGH
Yo boston hold the L
This is the best NBA finals ever you dont win during the game you win in. The last 2 mins of the game..
J buy it from
On my opinion, GS Warriors played BETTER in Game 2... This Game 4 has a LOT of pressures! 😂🤣
Curry is ridiculous how easy he can get open even with the best defenders
9:26 travel😕
Steph would have become greater than LBJ. Greatest shooter all time>Second-best player in NBA history
Golden State WARRIORS 100 vs 116 Boston CELTICS
#GREATNESS #NBA #GSW
What a performance for Steph dispite injury  #GSW #STEPH30 STRENGTH IN NUMBER
To his is going out to the Professors of Basketball and it's not just in the NBA. Here is my opinion and I'm not into basketball like that but just hear me out.  When the  controllers that run the world do anything $inister; they normally snitch on themselves to us by dropping clues.  Sports players receive the money that they make; it should really be known as hush money in these games that they play.   Could it be very well that Kobe Bryant was a tually going to consider letting out this secret?  Secrecy is a wild card in government; don't believe it? Ask the Secret Service. How can we have a Secret Service when we have a Constitution and a freedom of information act?  The job of these players which are actors; their job is to make the game appear as believable as possible. Each team already knows who is going to win not just the regular season games; they also know whether or not they are going to the playoffs.   The announcer said that the Celtics will be playing In San Francisco the next time they meet the Warriors. How can he say that and the Celtics playing in Boston, they didn't even lose the game yet and so the Celtics were winning in the 3rd and that was when I had an idea.  Here is what I said to myself; the Warriors are gonna win this game and that sends them back to San Francisco.   For the elite; they win; the players win because win or lose; they are living the great life and we are busting our humps just to buy their tickets and so the only ones coming up as suckers to the game are us. What do we get out of a trophy that you are never going to get to touch smell or stand next to for a picture?  These players marry and even have girl friends that would blow your freaking mind. They have Mansions that you would never be able to afford, cars you would never be able to purchase and clothes that you will only make you a window shopper and you are the ones that bought all of this stuff for them.  Forgive me if I'm wrong people but; when ever there be an opportunity in reference to BIG MONEY; Corruption s not going to be car behind when it comes to the MAN! Whose the man? he even gave you the answer to that; it's uncle Sam. Sam spelled halfway backwards is Master and we are their slaves.  There is only one way to fix this; don't go to any more sporting events. This is what Chuck D and Flava Flave meant when they said to fight the power. Well you can't fight your enemy funding his deceptions.
Don esteban curry de toa alta P.R.
Klay is washed. Feels bad because its due to injury. Hes just not as impactful as he once was.
What now Dub nation!! Talk now warriors haters!!
Warriors in 6
Ohh I'm sad becouse it's 1-3 I'm big golden States fan I'm sad
Damn, Curry shook Smart so hard his fat momma fell too 😝
You see what Dell Curry working with at the Celtic game? The NBC telecast didn't want to show her face, i wonder why?
Illegal screens from Looney all night and no-calls not being called on Warriors, is how they won this game.
https://youtu.be/JjsMzDjWjMw🎶
Tatum look like shit tonight, either he is too tired to play or smoked up!!!, too many turnovers
You know when there is a replay,  and Horford never touches Curry,  And refs call it a good Foul,.  Yet your eyes dont lie,  Never touched him at anytime,   GAME IS FIXED,  WORST RATINGS IN HISTORY,  SO THEY NEED 7 GAMES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    SAD SHIT,    NBA IS SO F---G CORRUPT ITS SICKENING AND SAD,                   ITS A  MADE FOR TV SITCOM NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man they better not be scripting a gs down 3-1 comeback since it happened to them with the cavs in 2016. Only happened once and it was to Gs. SAME as Seahwaks not winning bak to back chips by losing to Brady who was the last qb team to win back to back Sb. Hopefully they just let the Celtics take it this year
Man, this shit is boring with everyone and their mama taking 3's. I couldn't even make it through the highlights.
Yo refs seriously wtf
Klay has been shooting bricks this series and Poole is very inconsistent. They need to step up, Curry can't win this series by himself.
Shut up look at all the goldensexuals hahaha
Ang refery Sa judt Sa game 4 bisan pawl na wala ge pawl ewwww daya kaayo bisan game 3 maoh ra japon dapat ana ma tangal
Draymond Green is over rated and a waste of a roster spot.  He was just lucky enough to ride the coat tails of better players.
ESPN radio pls pls pls... Get rid of doris jerk?..talks way to much..omg..and to phoney bias..oyea Curry sukxx at 46millper..yr..wth

ref don't know how to call travel!!! always the ref ruin the game
nice refs.. so fckin stupid!!!  the giving Boston foul while warriors they don't
Draymond Green gives you nothing on offense. It was ok when KD was there but he has been the warriors biggest weakness due to his small size and non offense.
Curry was getting embarrassed on defense. I don't understand why people think he is so damn good when he can't even play defense.
Boston is bigger, stronger, and more athletic! I sure hope they win.
That was a surprising game thought the warriors wud take this one
Wow a! Warriors actually lost WOW
Bet you 5 Horford retires after this win 🏆
💚💚💚💚
🍀🍀🍀🍀
Steph had them catch up in the third, however, lost the momentum in the 4th. Wow...what's the next game gonna be like?! I don't see the Celtics necessarily sweeping, but ya never know lol.
Warriors really need to stick to their man and stop running around all over the place! pick a person stick with them! Kerr say something during the game wtf
Hey NBA what about the Uyghur’s #SCREWCHINA #USA
Great win for the celts, big 4th quarter once again.  It’ll be interesting going forward bc it seems Klay is starting to get in rhythm and feel his stroke.
It's the defense!

Great game
Lets go
🔥🔥🔥🔥
lets go
☘☘☘☘
Jaylen Brown 🔥🔥🔥
kerr needs to play his wild cards kuminga and moody
Great defense
Amazing game
I called 6 games Celtics win so far I’m on a roll calling the games I said game one was gng to Celtics and game 3 would be Celtics and game 4 is gng to go Celtics as well  game 5 will go to warriors but 6 will end at home for Celtics
Let me say in advance. Love this game.
Golden State let me play I will get y'all fifty
I would just like to take a second to appreciate just how high Rob williams III jumped when he threw down that lob from Al Horford at the 9:16 mark. His eyes were practically level with the rim.
Vamos warriors 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is Curry's best year in finals. He never performed too well in finals. He's been fantastic
Warriors another great 3rd Q but having problems again in the 4th
I noticed that Warriors keep doubling or even trippling anyone that gets in the paint because they play small. That leaves the rest of the Celtics shooters wide open for 3s. If they go one on one when Boston goes to the paint, theyre too small for Boston players. 🤷‍♂️
☘☘☘☘☘
Great team game
https://youtube.com/shorts/RhzgMj8xuO4?feature=share get ya jerseys from my friend
Good thing Williams was there to cover for the rest of the chokers.
It seems  the series is already decided...
The Celtics are very well put together team.. but I've heard people saying that the Celtics are just too big for the Warriors inside.. I wouldn't really look at that because the Grizzlies were also much bigger than the Warriors.. Robert Williams is a monster and he's making a huge impact but at the same time I think Jaren Jackson jr. is a better player and he was a big who was also giving the Warriors a lot of trouble inside
Warriors weakness is their 3s. No defense inside. Celtics have better all around defense and shooters, and that's the key just like Bulls.
If Warriors go down 3-1 they’ll come back watch, I don’t even like the warriors or Celtics but it’s a great series just have this weird feeling.
Boston Celtics in 6. 4-2. Great defense on the warriors.
Until these players take a stand for gun violence and Ukraine by striking and not playing in the finals we won't watch them anymore. Take a stand players and strike for gun violence and Ukraine
Can't stand the Boston Septics. With that being said, this team has a 90's feel. Udoka got this team ready. The GS problem is that the rest of the NBA has caught up with jacking up and making 3's. And GS defense is pedestrian at best. The REAL finals was Miami and Boston. I don't thing GS has got another game in them. Marcus Smart normally sucks as an offensive player but making Curry work on drives frees up the 3. Bet Boston is glad Smart hasn't been traded. He might be the FMVP.
Let’s go , fucks the els
I really don't like  Boston as a Lakers fun but I freaking hate golden state I hope Boston takes it in 5
4-2 celtics. You can tell the warriors don't want it as bad as the celtics do.
Ugh bucks would of been better
When you get out rebounded 46 to 31, you're most likely gonna lose. Just the facts...
Tatum jumper kinda ugly
I don't care who's team will win in this series, but my friend put Curry's name above any other makes me wanted the Celtics win this series to held his feet grounded again 😅
So fun to watch the Celt's play.   Great to see team ball again, tired of seeing big headed super stars that score in bunches and all the drama they bring.  Hope this Celt's team remains grounded - i want to watch them again in the finals for the next couple years.  They kinda remind me of the spurs.
Jaylen and Rob did well that game
awesome game
Al Horford will retire after getting his ring ?
draymond a bum
My boys teasing me about the warriors losing this game. Let's just see who the real king in the nba finals is
Celtics prime
Imagine 12 would have smack that in
i cant see how will the gsw respond on this loss. the play was simple they switch and attack on curry. he became a liability with 4 fouls. green is just a uniform without a perimeter threat boston leaves him to hit outside shot with a low percentage of scoring green is a useless piece in g3. good coaching for boston. boston knows how to win now against gsw.
can we all finally agree draymond green is sooooo over rated? but unfortunately because of all the attention he brings to himself with his big mouth he'll get voted in the HOF just like chris webber got voted in but not because of his big mouth but because of run of the mill average stat line which draymonds stats are even worse.  Put draymond on another team without the talent of gs and he never makes it to the playoffs under similar circumstances
The zone game for gsw is not working.  They need to go back to their previous way of play.  Celtics are playing like the warriors normally play less the # of 3 pointers.  But I'm sure they can win this final without curry if that happens to be.
Wow Ive Never Seen Such A Basketball Match Oooh What Massive Dunk  Nice Move From Celtics This Match Is Just About Over The Celtics Wins And Destroys Golden State Warriors What An Upset Here At TD Garden Arena!!!!
Muumuu you are m
Nice game not same others ,,,make hot and fighting,this games is soft and relax good jobs good vibes,also have good maners,and respect to everyone, remember the games is only games sports,win or lost,but have sacrefise,🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Watch the Warriors lose game 4 and comeback from a 3-1 deficit to win it all
shsjus he jdduiddiidjdjdid
Yo Steph Curry. Push Demar DeRozan to open up his own Burger Joint. Name it “ DeRozan’s”
The 0.25shoot time is just amazing
The NBA is stupid.   This isn’t basketball.
9:29 backcourt violation?
LETS GO BOSTON!!!
That’s not a good sign for Warrior fans: Curry and Thompson shot well yet they still lost handily. They caught up there and took the lead 87-85 or so, but not did they get outplayed across the board from then.
Delightfully tasteful watching the Celts outsmarting the Dubs inspite of many turnovers!
Lifetime Celtics Fan and always will be☘️❤️☘️
The refs handed the game to Boston with their calls. How y’all watch games like this is crazy. Just hand Boston the Chip for the publicity and call it a day.
DEAR CELTICS! If you’re listening! IF YOU WANT A CHANCE TO WIN THIS SERIES, YOU MUST DOUBLE TEAM CURRY!!! HE IS PLAYING OUT OF HIS MIND!!! You’re welcome - Stephen R
Jayson Tatum is the best
Time Lord on one knee jumping out of the gym @9:15
man, that playmaking by Boston was amazing. you don't like basketball if you don't like unselfish scoring.
I was cheering for the warriors lol
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
*MIKE BREEN IS BACK*
Warriors are pathetic!  What kind of NBA team is that? No legitimate center.  That is the reason why NBA game will not succeed on FIBA tournaments.  One on one games is actually boring and kind a sleepy game
Tatum and jaylen play in like legends so glad they on my team
🍀
I think Williams was the biggest factor. The others gonna do what they do but Warriors gotta make Tatum do more, get him tired and that will interrupt Williams. Just box him out more. But Poole gotta get saucy, if not then I need him to foul out if he ain't gonna score.
A "ranDu"m thought🤔...that inbound pass to JB looked like Al 'Tom Brady' Horford...if the Celts win this series, all the retired players are gonna Pop a bottle like the '72 Dolphins 🤣...🤨opinions?
nba has become a three point shoot out I hate it makes the game way more boring
Celtics now iyak later HAHAHAHA
Celtics coming strong their defends let’s the warriors not shoot but they still find the way Boston was holding on to the lead
Draymond Green score 2points only and that's the big Problem cause all the Celtics Member score 10 points above.
That's is why Celtics is the champ in east
Mid teams
Get curry some damn help
First 🥇 time ⌚ I saw👀 nba 🏀🏀
Gsw wtf they not even that good
The game is not YET OVER FOLKS SOLID GSW💪🔥🔥
Curry was in his bag 💰
Fucking ridiculous man. Warriors should’ve won all 4 games.
Does every player represent downtown?
great game
Go GSW
Boston don’t ease up on them bring that chip back home to the East.  Go Boston!!
Draymond is such a punk
Great game
Curry can't guard!!!
Draymond getting bullied all series
NBA is WEAK AS SHIT
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think brown is mvp so far for Boston.  This is curry’s mvp to lose because he is the best player. Needs to win series though
just beautiful defense like at 8:57
Blessed are those who trust in the Lord whose confidence is in Him Jeremiah 17:7
Aye I just was listening to Big Hurl On All Streaming platforms....
Celtics playing real basketball high % shots and defense
https://youtu.be/LZDSnyNi4Vc
Warriors 4-2
Who wins fmvp in Boston ?
Suns vs Miami 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Williams impact 🔥🔥🔥
The Jaylen Brown game
Almost blow it in the 3rd
Great game
11 points in the 4th quarter to lose!? Give me a break!! Damn NBA!!! You CANNOT trust Sports anymore!!!
Kyrie swinging in air right now!
Don’t sleep on Grant dudes a beast got in and up between two dudes under rim and still made it
Just thinking if the Warriors had LaMelo Ball right now, they would probably be on their way to another title, instead of on the verge of an embarrassing defeat.  I've always thought the Warriors were missing a pure point guard and that's one area the Warriors can improve in.  Draymond Green had one of the worst playoff stats I've ever seen for a Point Forward (2 pts, 3 ast)....Green needs to channel Magic Johnson (20 pts and 12 ast) for the Warriors to have a chance to win Game 4.
Tatum is a better Kobe than Booker smh
How in god's green earth did Mr triple single Draymond  ever make 7 all stars ? He sucks
That’s crazy watchin yo big bro lose to the same team he lost to smh 🥲
It’s over! Warriors don’t have enough weapons for Celtics’ defense
Celtics are the better team this year.
By the time the Cs are done with this series GS will be  Bloody and battered

Wayson Watum ☘️🍀🏀
Great team game
Williams had so much impact here
Jaylen Brown was big
Great game
BOSTON CELTICS I LOVE BOSTON CELTICS 2022 BOSTON CELTICS
They did Draymond Green dirty. They put his missed layup lowlight haha.
Jason Tatum proud pinoy 🇵🇭
Warriors look slow and confused on defense
This type of gameplay makes folk want to watch. Great entertainment!
im a warriors fan.. but man!! this Boston team  is way too big than the warriors line up in every game..
Awesome game from Jaylen Brown
It’s amazing to me how much draymond football Green gets away with on the court 😂 dude is straight up Ron Artest 2.0 and the refs are cool with it lol
OP BHAI PLZ SUPPORT GUYS 🙏
OP BHAI PLZ SUPPORT GUYS 🙏
TATUM IS MORE LIKE MELO THAN KOBE
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                    ///////////////////...................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/.,/,./,
Celtic fund is bad character shame on yuo nba should action this
I don't care who wins the title. Both teams are just so amazing.
I don't keep up with basketball like I used to but I must say this Celtics team is super athletic !!!!! This is going to be a great series.
Curry needs a screen at the perimeter to shoot comfortable. I observed in this game 3 that lack of screen to curry. Screen is important if the players are small.
Steph curry com
Trash bag
keep spreading love God bless trust Jesus plan. He says commit your work to the Lord and your plans will be established proverbs 16:3 much love great vid and game
Beautiful baskeball by Celtics
Big Celtics fan here and love to see them win this game but my god they need to figure out what the hell to do in the 3rd quarter
Damn. Tough loss for the Warriors, but Celtics want it more, " as the world turns".... I think Warriors get one but the Celtics get two, Win in game 6. Horford for MVP .
WIGGINS needs to have multiple 30-40+ nights for GS to win 🏆
Tatum is a pussy!!!!! Whiner, complainer, entitled.   Jaylen Brown is the MVP!!! and underrated.  Tatum is way overrated and talked up way too much.
Damn leprechaun was in the building again
Green was so paralyze with Williams 😃
Congratulations celtics. But don’t be too over confident about Celtics you will get to know in upcoming matches y GSW is special team
Celtics in 5
Fake. All plan don't bet $$$  Edit     if u like wwf then keep watching
Green why gsw defeat
https://youtu.be/kkWkaGJYrM8
THEY'RE LIGHTING IT UP LIKE A FIRESTORM!!!!!
I hate the Golden State Warriors and their bandwagon jumping fans
Can only hope that coach has the answer. We're watching the most talented athletes on this planet.
At 9:07 who pushed Jalen Brown like that? Al Horford?
WOW
no disrespect to the warriors but 4:13 seemed like all star game defense
Me,My brother, my mom, and my grandpa were all watching this live then my mom said  " I bet The Celtics are gonna win" Then I go "If you’re not picking Curry your not trying" 😂
The Boston trio did their scoring duties as expected of them but the difference maker is Rob Williams!
on my message, I just want to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart, and that he is waiting for you to hold him and take up your cross and follow him 😊😊 good day 🌞
Stephanie Lurry sucks proven himself that he can't carry his team what a shame what can we expect from a fake MVP fake super star trash 🤮🤮🤮
Boston Lang malakas
Robert Williams one factor of winning game 3, reminds me of Robert Parish of BOSTON
The Celtics are special.
This was great
Jaylen brown went in
Such a great game
what a difference a coach makes
Hence I don't understand how you hype of Stephen Curry. Offense 100/100. Defense 67/100. They were just attacking Curry especially Tatum.
Warriors look defeated.
tatum didn't travel at 6:54 ?
Boston Strong!!!
Young and flesh legs wins the game. I think Celtics are very very athletic.
Bro I’m like losing my mind Curry shots are insane. I feel like Celtics got it GS has no inside and Celtics have good perimeter D. Draymond is getting shut out. He’s got 15 in 3 games of a finals. Tied series road game didn’t drop 5 didn’t board 5 didn’t even assist 5. Not starting stats.
Draymond getting abused on every play lmao
This year's Celtics are different they are well-prepared for a youthful team.
The warriors got this ‼️
Aye Jordan Poole need to do that move more at 7:39 😭😭
I keep hearing JB for finals MVP. With all do respect for Brown who deserves alot of credit for his playing but without Tatum getting so much attention he wouldn't be able able to carry this Celtivs team by himself. #Tatum4MVP!!!
Just my opinion but gsw needs to have that lead or atleast cut the lead by 1 possession in the first half because you dont want boston to have that confidence and momentum coming second half. Gsw is known for playing good and having that comebacks in the 3rd quarter but you dont need to always rely on that because if boston got the lead in the 4th its really hard for gsw to pull off a comeback because of celtics defense
Ahhh shitttt nick nick
Al Horford with the 80 yard TD!  He was like hurry up ref I got this
Let’s go Celtics won
Who win
4:01 "Curry, catches, fires, SHORES!"
https://youtu.be/w6POZMyIlt4 God bless!!
“2 wins away from a title” that really hit different for me. Been a fan since 08 and I just can’t wait to taste that sweet victory pie baby. Just me and that guy who tatted up his arm “Boston Celtics 2022 Champions”
Sharing is caring
Good game
Some good basketball
Brown is that dude
Great video
Fire 🔥🔥
Amazing
Damn not steph curry he getting cooked by jb not the warriors get lebron on your team smooth sailing after that
some of GSW fans did not watch this Highlights coz if they did it should be in number 1 trending😂
Celtics in 6 fam
road to game 7
Geeez Warriors got thrashed twice now. Another one comin.
now where are those clueless GSW di*kriders who said "Warriors in 4" you clearly dont understand matchups.. im glad that my prediction is happening (anyone who wins the series between bucks and celtics will win the championship)
Lol..what a drama. I’ve said before and I’m saying it now. I’ll go all the way to game 6 or 7. Win lose win lose win lose. All rigged. They are making money by dragging the finals to game 7. I only watch game 6 or 7. Don’t waste your time by watching game 1 to 5. It has already been decided. Griddle NBA.z
warriors with the current lineup are just physically overwhelmed , looney getting benched in the 4th kuminga getting garbage minutes..they had otto guarding horford lol n dray is physical but rob williams just too big
As a Celtics fan.. I went from DWhite biggest hater to his biggest fan this series 🤣🤣
Yeahhh, I’m like Charles how about them crying babies GSW fans!.. lolz 😆😂🤣😅
Al horford went from Al horrible to Al horford and he deserves a ring for stepping his game up and finally making the NBA finals Go Celtics beat Golden Mistake Curry chicken and Gay Thompson and Doo Doo Green 😝😝😝😝😝😝I like the warriors too 😁
Nice move Boston💚
All talk no action. Draymond is overrated. JB handled him in the 1st easily.
This is gonna be a long gentleman sweep for GSW. I’ve been saying GSW can’t win bc they’re too small.
celtics in 6
Hmmm unless things change the warriors appear headed for choke city once more
boston 😅 Gs all the way ..
Sanayan mopa weliams idol gogo kayo ang mananalo sa for champion
I honestly feel smart is a cancer to celtics …all he does is turnovers
warriors is too small for this league
not a fan of celtics but i see the warriors losing
You put a little physicality on the Warriors and they collapse.
Ima mavs fan but Marcus smart my fav Celtic was a fan since his college incident lol
I think when Draymond Green got fouled out that it was a stupid call. Clearly Curry had the ball, yet Al Horford did a reach in foul
Curry really showing he’s a defensive liability
Where the bandwagon warriors fans now ? 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫all that talk just to get smoked
I'm not a Boston fan & am definitely not a warriors fan but I hope Boston whips on golden state and wins the whole thing. Let's go Yankees....
I remember when Draymond Green told KD..."We don't need u,we won with u,& we'll win without u"!!! Maybe they will, EVENTUALLY,but they're NOT beatn the Celtics without him!!!
warriors offense is a joke. illegal screens and three point prayers.
NBA can go kiss off. Nobody even watches it anymore, you ever ruin the league, completely destroyed it. Should be called the national shit league, the racism is rampant, and white, white people don’t play basketball anymore either? Racist league.
Draymond is so overrated the whole warriors team I say anybody can be beat on any giving day just like Milwaukee WHO'S enough said ✌️💯💯💯
That 7 point play was crazy
4:27 Can someone explain why that isn't a foul on draymond?
this why the warriors are down 7:00, mfs way too slow
Green 🥴
Karma will hit al horford. Hope he gets injured
Warriors fans should be terrified
Hit curry in da nuts around 9:35
Curry is nasty on offense but he's too small on D.
It’s crazy how everybody like Boston for the win now 😳😳🤣🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️..BTW I’m an LeBron Ijs..lol!! yes i took Boston for the W now it’s seems like the world did too🤣
Series is not over.  Warriors in 7.
Good defense beats good offense even if your team has one of the best shooters!
Time Lord is my new fave player. What a hustler.
Williams was harnessing draymond 😭
GSW is good for shooting Threes and that's why i'm rooting for Boston as a Laker fan!!!!
*C'mon coach Pop* . Come to a game and watch your boys (Udoka and Kerr) *do some great coaching*  of Celtics and Warriors. Sometimes I feel like I am watching the *Spurs*  out there!!!  *You should be proud Sir* !
Wait .. Curry may be the greatest pure shooter of all time... But, def NOT clutch. Disappears in games when they lose.
Golden State should’ve had more big man on the floor their crucial mistake was having too many smalls looney would’ve been a game changer especially on the rebound aspect of it
💀💀💀💀💀💀🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🥷🥷🥷
Looney didn't play in 4 quarter that's why they cannot get rebound
We winning the finals trust me
Damn brown clamped  tf out of Klay 😂
Draymond… Get out!
Warriors will win game 7 mark my word!
celtics in 6
@NBA please consider showing the full possession at the start of the shot clock. it's interesting to see how the play develops
The GSW highlights and "Jordan Poole looking at a woman and turning up" have been real quiet today, it's all I saw after game 2, talk when you win, hush when you lose, you should be confident in your team no matter what, but that's for the real fans, not the Fairweathers. GO CELTICS 🍀
The bald announcer on Tv that is pro-Celtics is terrible!
Points in the Paint;  Looks like Boston gonna Win it all because they Dominate the Paint and everyone knows the Saying, live by the 3, die by the 3.
The Celtics ran that whoever offense on steph curry
Any teams that came from California are made of a bunch of azz O players like Draymond Green,  Stephen Curry, and their coach Steve Kerr. Remember Kobe Bryant and LeBron James?   I never like California's basketball teams. 😜😜😜
Oh yea we got ourselves a good nba battle... this is definitely going to game 7.👍👍✌
I love none of you all see what's happening. The league wants this to go to 7, SO badly. They do this all the time, but this time is ridiculously obvious. They know GS is the more dangerous team, so they'll keep Boston "up 1" until the end. Boston was so favored in G1, then GS got every call in G2, and then it shifted obviously back to Boston in G3. Now watch, GS will get the benefit of the whistles in G4. What I'm rooting for is for the Celtics to actually win G4 in spite of the leagues efforts, but so ya'll can REALLY see how rigged it is, as the league would then need to go ALL OUT for GS in G5 to ensure at the bare minimum a 6 game series with Boston winning at home. This is all about money, and basketball is the easiest sport, outside of probably Baseball (strike zone) to rig without casual fans noticing.
Nobody is talking about how the Celtics tried to cheat by raising the Warriors goal 2 inches and cutting their shoot around time short? Trash!! Adam Silver should do something
If only both teams could lose these finals.
Awesome game, awesome celts, I knew they had it in them ever since Tatum's rookie year! I have to say, though... That 7 point play was complete BS because Curry JUMPED INTO Al Horford. If you study the replay, Curry jumped forward into Al by roughly 2-3 feet!!!
9 points in 10 last 10 minutes for the Warriors... THATS DEFENSE
It’s over this would be the biggest upset but the greatest team effort at the same damn time lol Boston definitely taking this one
Celtics In 6
Repent Israelites all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
CELTICS IN 5 or 6!!!
The energy is insane 😤🔥🔥🔥
Jaylen Brown killed it
Awesome game
But hear me out big Al as quarterback
I wonder why I'm seeing some Spurs inspired plays on this team 🤔
1:54.  Absolutely beautiful.
Some rare defensive highlights. O_O
Jaylen Brown was getting away with travels and fouls all game. @9:00 this is a clear reaching foul and on the block his arm was on the shoulder of Klay holding klay down and propping himself up.
@5:54 you can see smart holding Wiggins. The fix is in and it's so obvious. That was an easy call. Every drive JT drive to the goal he extends his arm pushing the defender away. it's funny because they call that on Kyrie all the time
Pa champion niyo naman boston tagal ng di nag champion yan😅🏆🏆🏆
Andrew Wiggins first Canadian champion that deserve finals MVP for smokin some luckycharms packs
Smoke n drink 2 that
Best play is at 4:41
Boston Neva lost a finals when they up 2-1 they 12-0 in franchise history
I find it funny that green thinks hes nice dude had 2 points lmao
yall still sleepin on the celtics.. incredible
celtics looking like yeah it just had to be 🫣😌
for a second steph almost got into takeover mode
jalen getting it done with some flash
This was the Jaylen brown show
Awesome game
to be honest, I think that Stephen curry is just a show off, the way he hangs his mouthguard out of his mouth and his deep threes. I want the Celtics to win the finals
jalen with no time to sleep
Green just didn't have any effort geezzzz
The fact that so many teams turned down Ime Udoka to be their head coach seems completely absurd right now.  It's easy to forget that before January this Celtics core was basically .500 for the last two years.
Good bye Warriors. Couldn’t happen to a worse team
Im not even a celtics fan or warriors, im just here to watch the warriors fan being salty over a game.
KD would have his 3rd finals MVP I'm sure
Celtics in 6 or 7. Miami was absolutely the toughest dog left in the pin for boston. The warriors look more dangerous on paper but they simply dont have the grit on a team level like miami and boston has.
Brown is Jordan with 3pt.
Boston Celtics🍀:2 Golden State Warriors🌉:1   GAME 4 on Friday in Boston
Green going to fuck it up for the warriors and the rest of the team need to step up if they want to win the championship
FREE WNBA STAR 2 🥇 AMERICAN BRITTNEY GRINER! Her life matters just as much as Russian Ukrainians and Trevor Reed lives. Racism is evil it's of the Devil.
I never liked boston critics and never gonna like
Peep they left out all the hacking the celtics did and didn’t show any of the terrible calls made by refs. I literally got screenshots from the game of the warriors pretty much getting beat up. 😂 shits a joke.
Boston will pay in game 4. Big time!
I called this! Celtics are going to win. It’s a bad matchup for Goldenstate.
Holford out to get Curry. Shoulda been ejected the second time.
Inman patio km m mmn mmmmxzsbvb no bc iooooolkl no
Good luck to this team ..get 2 more wins.  Still dont like the 2 TOs by Smart passing to GSW player, and the careless one by JT at the end they are the habitual ones will bite us bad as they did in previoius losses. They need to clean those up to have a chance against this very good GSW team. Hope we get 2 more games of  Robert Willliams , he has been the huge difference maker, and Al Hoford and other role players , no TOs.... that should help us out. Gooo  Celtics.
Yes first finals and what they did to gsw is hurt steph obviously including trash talks by fans to gsw esp. To green! What a good? team is this trash talking and butcher this celtics team is. Esp. Brown &  Smart who tries to hurt curry little by little. Thats how good their team is .. C Coach really planned on physicality attack on gsw esp. Curry. Celtics wll win that way? And their coach is coaching with ill intent and instructing to do ill to his team? Oh they are real good in evil things. The Bad can never put the   good ones  down , maybe some time but never will prevail in the end!
Jaylen Brown owned Draymond Green’s ass yo
curry's like that old man at the gym you pick up just because he's still got a jump shot but can't guard anyone so you have to make up for it .
Curry too small
Jayson Tatum is the best all around scorer on the floor
Congratulations Boston. So far, so 😃👍🏾🍀
If the Celtics have a limited turnover game and alright shooting, I don’t see why they can’t win game 4
https://youtu.be/Wn04e-06ScM

even Celtics win the series, it don't count cuz Middleton was injured
Celtics in 7
Tatum is a beast
Golden fake warriors
Man the commentators really need to get off warriors d bro. Give the celtics the same excitement u give the warriors bro like damn give them the credit.
#JusticeForActMan
I LOVE THIS NEW FLOATING CAMERA.
showboating warriors never wins 🤪🤪🤪
Seems like Celtics have a size advantage over the Warriors. That's why they are able to rebound, make points off of put backs, and make easy layups in the paint. Warriors needs to recruit some size this Summer. I thinking Celtics win game 4 and 5, winning the series.
a team w no true point guard and wins then that shows the opposing team lacks defense
I don't live in California or Boston but the refs were terrible against the Warriors. I watched the game at a sports restaurant with other fans from different teams and they saw same slant against the Warriors.  NBA is having problems with viewers and people see the slanted refs that bad against that Warriors team.
This series should be easily 3-0 Boston with how they’ve been playing
The nba needs to do something about illegal screens
ITS OUR TIME!!!!  CELTIC PRIDE
Warriors in 6
I have to hand it to the Boston Baked Beans.    Apparently they can mug the opposing team with impunity and get away with it.   That is impressive.   From what I saw there were uncalled fouls committed by the Baked Beans even on blocks - what the refs were missing was the pulling on jerseys and or coming over the back of the opposing player.    I did notice that the Boston Baked Beans were benefiting from some ticky tack calls (just like in game 1) called against Golden State.   I like both teams and know that the Baked Beans fans are rather indignant about ref calls lately so I am sure they will join me on repudiating the poor calls made in game 1 and 3 that benefited their team.    It is odd that mugging the opposing team coincides when they win games.
Did anyone notice anything strange with the reff'ing last night ?  I hate both teams - but it looks to me like the calls were going Bostons way - BIG TIME !!!!
Curry he is using bob cousy to beat you. 2 points 17 assist 10 steals. Thank me later. You still  the best point.
A little less scoring and more defensive plays is what this needed.
The ball movement by both teams is a thing of beauty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYmzlW-ct9c&t=41s
Side note: Jaylen Brown is on pace to be the 2022 Finals MVP.
Gg
Green's a mess here in this game (2pts, 4 rebs). His lack of  being a scoring threat and an 'actual" scorer is beginning to be a liability for the Warrior's offense and an advantage to the Celtic's defense. Who ever is guarding Green can just slack off a little bit  or even double team to provide or increase strength to their perimeter defense knowing he's such a low offensive threat, plus knowing if you run into him (to defend), he's almost always going to pass the ball to a team mate regardless if the team mate is really open or going to be double-teamed just as quick. He's against Rob Will and Al both of whom makes plays for themselves offensively either by making themselves open for a three or mid-range with Al and alley-oops for Rob Will. Plus the fact they're really not afraid to really mix it up with Green. If Green does low post-ups back to the basket moves, catches lob passes for dunks, or even just round around to lose his man to either confuse  or just shake the defense a bit and maybe be open, instead of just screens, catching and passing balls, or picking up loose balls, his team mates might get a longer time to be open, might not get doubled-teamed all the time and even might make the Celtics defense unable adjust to stop them from scoring at will. Credit to the relentless defense of the Celtics and balanced efficient offense.
Can Jordan Poole get more time his numbers is down bad right now seem like Kerr not playing him as much n you might need his spark dude can get to it
This is lovely this will show if The dubs are really dubs game 4 is there game 7 if they lose again it’s wraps I’ve watched all 3 games they look lost even when they win I feel like the league could’ve been bigger there not playing with that finals fire I’m getting chilled regular season energy klay scoring well steph having career nights meanwhile draymond tackling everything except a rebound
No one talking about how draymond had 2 points and was getting dominated on the boards Lmaooo and he says he’s a legend 😂😂
That new style of basketball is being exposed you gotta play defense and hustle for the ball. It makes the game much more beautiful to watch. They didn’t call a lot of bs and you see the results.
Jxmy called it from the very beginning, Celtics taking it all
Draymond wanted no part of Jaylen at 4:10, dropped more points in the 1Q than Draymond has all series 😂
Still can’t believe people were saying break up Tatum & Brown. Celtics would’ve been pure idiots if they did that. Those 2 are GEMS!!! 💎 even though Brown is more slept on than Tatum..
In 2010 Lakers won the championship 😎 4 games to 3
What a game...legit highlight reel all game long
Outstanding #BostonStrong
That veteran play from al horford the pass to jaylen brown from out of bounds was legendary...
And that's even without Bo Cruz. Embarrassing, GSW.
Simple play Attack Curry he can’t defend at all ‼️‼️‼️💪💪💪 Good Job C’s ☘️
Jordan needed to score more klay and curry stepped up but Poole didn’t
#GSW y’all defense suck!!! GO hard or GO home!!!!! Offense is even lacking this trip!! These Boys ain’t playing!!! They passing all around y’all,picking,Goin str8n down the middle and y’all just b standing there and their pace is awesome KEEP UP!!! But good game tho
Series is over. It's time to start jk to get him the experience
They just like them but they can go in and play big to little
I told my cousins Boston gone best Golden State
God bless❤️
gotta respect Smart franchise player
before the league marcus smart was a penetrating attack point guard over a OSU..he was a big offensive threat and imo will always be
The pushing by Boston is insane. Every play they are pushing off on offense or shoving people on defense. Love that the game was closer to MMA then basketball. Sadly, that isn't what I want to see in a NBA Finals.
Kyang kya habolin ng wrros pinag bigyan LNG laro.
THATS MY BOYS!! GO CELTICS 🍀🏀🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️✂️👁👁💨
You have to respect both these team. They both committed to building from scratch, and this is what they get.   A trip 2 the finals.
Warriors, you want class, get some first.
Celtics in 6!
Jaylen Brown is a different type of animal. He’s constantly a threat every game.
Draymond Green stat line: 2 pts, 4 rbs, 3 assists, 6 fouls 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Celtics solo
“You should be faithful     to your wife, just as you take water     from your own well. 16 And don't be like a stream from which just any woman     may take a drink. 17 Save yourself for your wife and don't have sex     with other women.” Proverbs 5:15-17 CEV
WOW!! The comment section here is on point! So much better than any commentary syndicate shows.  Cheers for the great series.
If jaylen brown doesn't get finals MVP this Celtics team will be broken up in few years he's not gonna keep living in Tatum shadow he doesn't get enough credit and we seen guys leave good situations for not getting credit for they work
Nah bruh Steph is so fucking good like it’s honestly insane how him and his team can just get hit from 3 and no matter what they just don’t miss
Steve Kerr should take some of the blame played small ball all game
Still wish Miami didnt choke smh they dederved it
Hmm... Jalen Brown had 17 in the first quarter. Who was guarding that guy? I know it couldn't have been Draymond Green, because Draymond is an elite defender, right? This couldn't also be Draymond at 2:36, could it? Nah. And Draymond can guard centers, right? Unless this is him again at 2:49??
4:06 Today's players still kind of remember how basketball should be played. Also 9:06 gotta love when vets like Horford show you how it's done.  Horford entered the league when I was in high school. Never thought I'd think of him as a vet. Time, man.
Defense wins championships and Boston is about to prove it for the millionth time.
Curry is a liability on the defensive end.  It seems like every play they switch to have him go up against a bigger player and the majority of the points were scored against him.  I really don't know why people would put him as one of the top players in the history of the NBA.  He is great on offense but sucks on  defense.
Keep it up in game 4 and it’s all over
So if winning this year supposedly means the Warriors are the best dynasty in the league (I'd still take Jordan's Bulls, Magic's Lakers, Duncan's Spurs, Shaq's Lakers and Bird's Celtics over Steph's Warriors), what would losing it mean?
Famous last words: "Boston takes game 3, they're 2 wins away from a title"
Celtics in 6
Soft defense from both sides. Nobody wants defense, all they want to do is copy-cat james harden's step back three. Copy cat.
Both teams have a ton of weakness whoever can exploit it or make the most adjustments will win.
I hate that incredulous look that Warriors players have when the refs call a foul on them. Draymond Green gets away with so much jawing at the refs
Who else heard gayson tatum
Warriors are too small
Draymond getting destroyed by a role player playing on one good knee. Shaq would eat him alive and shit him out at halftime.
It's a beauty of the game when the celtics playing the right way sharing the ball it looks a lot easier when they play like that they are tough to beat and if tatum continue to grow into the best all around player what i like the most about his game attacking the rim penetrate inside or a kickout to the open guy for the trey if he can do that all the time and don't force and trust his teammates we gonna win the series.
Celtics are just to big n long for goldenstate
Why steph goin for two wen it matters that’s why they got smoked lol
Celtics looking toughhh!
What is up with these nba2k camera angles?
Well Boston to win u must acquire and seek shet that’s how to win
I believe the Boston Celtics will be the victors in this here 2022 NBA Finals. The Warriors have made quite a komeback however it's destined for the Celts to walk away with the trophy 🏆
Doesn’t even matter to me who wins it all. Underrated teams straight up going at it. Fun series so far 🔥
warriors in 6
This game made me mad for some reason.
Why would Steve Kerr take curry out when he's got he's lighting it up out there then put him back in again that messed up his shot later on that pretty lost the game for them I understand everybody else need to step up but when your best player is hitting lot of his shots I would leave him in might be a better chance to win the game
Curry has definitely been the most consistent player in the finals, but the Celtics have been the better all around team. Their depth has been better and they have better big men.
Two words for the warriors/ Javell McGhee
Jalen brown is the next lebron no cap.
Finals of colors: - Brown (Jalen) - White (Derrick) - Green (Draymond)
Dirty Donkey Douchemond, the dirtiest douche in the league running his lips and getting 2 points 😂🤣.
Great game exciting to watch, however these refs are ruining it imo. Both sides are getting so dumb calls.  I was watching the game and it feels like both sides are being robbed by dumb calls. Maybe that’s just me though
Boston aggressively attacking the best defender of GSW draymond green.
Horford hungry I can’t even lie … and I’m a warriors fan
Green looking old out there. Them youngboys doggn his ahh
E
,n.
Jaylen Brown finals MVP so far imo
How come there was only one Steph highlight from the 4th?
#strengthinBandwagon #ClassicPeenoyBandwagon #wePeenoysOnlyKnowCurryDurantKobeJordanLebron
go celtics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️
Draymond's fat mouth back to bite his fat ass again.
Brown for MVP. who thinks Brown for MVP?
Loved this game! Both teams showed game plans but Celtics showed great defense. It was a 3pt shootout indeed! 🏀👌👍  Watching here from 🇵🇭🏀🙂
Go celtics
The warriors dynasty is fake they haven’t beat a healthy team in the finals without KD💯 they beat Lebron with an injured Kylie lost to the raptors this will be their 2nd lost finals without KD
Go Celtics
Draymond Green is a Dirty Joke Player. I am a GSW fan but I see him as someone who's not helping the team to win right now but rather helping the team to NOT win the game.   He looked so resolve to play dirty instead of playing the right way and make the right play
I'm a lifelong New England sports fan and I'm not getting excited yet.  I feel like this year's Celtics team is big strong, young and fundamentally sound. But I think the main reason why their going blow for blow with the warriors is, we can bang threes as well. Usually the warriors start banging crazy long threes and teams just  fold! We counter punch them right back with threes of our own. Great series.
I hope Jaylen Brown gets MVP~!!!  He's the one who stepped up to Dee-Bo Draymond.
Draymond Green is overrated.
Where’s all the GSW casuals in the comments? 🤣
This would be known as the Jaylen Brown game
9:02 JB said NAAAH BRUHH
Game 4 is a must win for both teams
Klay and curry went off and they still lost by double digits that’s concerning
C’mon Warriors! Gotta play 4 quarters of basketball. Boston’s defense definitely tightens up in the 4th.   Great series that will probably go 7 games
We are back to Square 1 boyz!!!! Celtics leading 🥶🥶
4:14 brown to block???
GAME 7 Anyone?
Warriors haven't been showboating as usual in this series with Celtics.
Curry pulls a Lebron at 1:35
Lets go Celtics
I'm no Celtics fan, but I firmly believe the window closed on GS two seasons ago. YESS!!! Go Celtics. Like I said; Celtics in 6.
Take aways.  Wiggins needs to stop shooting so many 3s drive and dunk more. That's what Tatum did and it's working really good for him.  Draymond green is an unathletic bum that needs to be benched. A taller or faster replacement is needed. Someone actually willing to put the damn ball in the Hoop.  Curry plays like a spoiled brat at times. His passing when he's tired or frustrated is terrible.  Klay had 1 good game but he misses at key times.  Porter and Poole need to step it up.  The Celtics are playing great team ball on offense and defense.  Kerr has been coaching terrible.   Having quicker more athletic players like Tatum and Brown are a nightmare for shooters like Steph and Klay.  Have to mention again Green is a bum.
Trade dray for a box of potato.
Warriors got next 🔥
Celtics defense was so good this game there defense forced multiple turnovers congrats for the Celtics even tho I wanted warriors to win
Jalen brown needs to watch himself, he's gonna get hurt
*Good response game from Brown after being punked by Green game 2*
The better coach won the game. Steve Kerr doesn't know when to keep a player in the game and when to switch. 🤦🏾🤦🏾‍♂️
This is one of the best finals in a long time
Kyrie Irving punching the air right now 😂
Klay Thompson on fire in game 4
g Go Celtics😇🤠
Don't feel good to have another team shooting threes all the time do it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Green calls himself a defender. Didn’t even challenge Brown on that dunk, just watched him dunk it.
Did Sir Flops Alot Curry play soccer in a previous life?  Because he spends a lot of time rolling around on the ground.
NBA is boring, just threes and harden copied-cat step back three. Slam dunks and power moves in the paint is what we should pay in watching.
"3 times a charm" .....this  series is soooo interesting. Spicy,sensational,and serious. I'm a GSW fan. Steph u remember OKC OT 118 118 with .6 seconds left and u hit  that amazing 3 to win. Making Durant trade. Remember. Different  and difficult  makes you you. Klay and Dray u know what to do. Knock it off Let's  go. 🔥 💯
6:05, That 4point play could have been his last shot in this series, too risky
Boston is playing like a NHL team with a hot goalie in the playoffs.
The larriors!! 🤡🤡🤡
chill. its only game 3.  if the celtics lost in game 4 , its over. remember gsw has the court advantage. 2-2 is dangareous for celtics.  mark my words.
Boston is a city of champions. Not just basketball. They ate literally great at everything
Curry really is the final boss, Celtics 7 since game 6 klay is a menace too.
Warriors need a solid center. That’s what’s always been missing. That one Finals where Andrew Bogut went down they weren’t the same. They need points in the paint or it’s over
Warriors vs Refs
M.Smart is a dirty ass player. 💯
That foul call on Alford against Curry was bs!!
yes Boston wins,!!!

Celtics have won this series after tonight
kerr should sub draymond if he did not play well, curry needs more help.
🍀🍀🦾🦾
Personally, I wouldn’t let this loss slide

I love the series..an experienced team that is still within its prime and a young team both in its age and identity of style. Their are no lovers in this contest, just great examples of well taught basketball. I only wish the less than admirable mind set of Draymond Green would grow up and just speak with his abilities and not with attitude. Otherwise. It's been a great showing.
Jaylen Brown is the man!
vi todo elgame los árbitros tuvieron un papel preponderante en el resultado del partido, ese sr White creo se llama por cualquier cosa se tiraba, pero me parece que la question era desconectar a curry del partido y lo consiguieron, que nadie me ataque por esto es solo una opinión porque soy fans de lakers
Best game of the series
I need this series to go to game 7. It would be so intense
Boston Strong 🍀
Celtics cheated
Yf
Looks like Celtics in 5, 6 tops
lfg
Warriors in 7 😎🤙🏾
I don’t know what’s going on with dray but he’s playing horribly.
Celtics fan celebrated like they already won the serie
Watch out. Warriors could steal game 4, they’re most likely winning game 5 giving them a 3-2 lead. Still anybodys ship
JB MVP !
Wiggins is a scrub. From a Wolves fan
Too many flops and chasing ankles  are what Bos thrives on the court. Pathetic!!
Wow what a game, they took the souls outta GS 👏  That ball movement is amazing, there's a lot of old school pick and rolls and jump shot and 3s... just beautiful basketball 🏀
What is with the first and forth quarters for the warriors
damn my celtics are so good
Celtics balling game 7 will decide
Celtics just seems like hungrier team in this series. Unless something changes I can't see GS beating them 3 more times
LAKERS 2022 CHAMPION
Celtics in 6 I been saying it
Wiggins never shows up in meaningful games. This is the status quo with him.
Games like these are what I think of when people talk about how great Draymond is. You can't be great if you're a liability when it counts.
Smfh
JB finals mvp!!
anybody notice how much Jeff Van Gundy dislikes the celtics, Just listen closely and you will see.
My only criticism of Steve Kerr as a coach is not playing Kuminga more no one on the Celtics roster can match his athleticism and  he got that lockdown D.
Klay looked good. Curry, as expected, put on a show. Draymond was a magician last night the way he completely disappeared. Celtics just look too big, much more athletic & younger. Dubs Cannot lose game 4(in Boston) & expect to win these Finals! 💯        #BleedGreen #CUsRise                          #BostonStrong
Jaylen Brown might just mess around and win finals mvp
Warriors fans real quiet right now 👀
Man i did not want to play Boston at all cuz it's the worst match up for us GS had better defenders and scorers but still Boston has a hell of a team and just super matched
That 7 point play was CRAZY
Jaylen Brown is a superstar. I’m excited for his future when he is the sole centerpiece of a contending team.
Celtics in 7
NBA is rigged people but with no Elite decisions in NBA games I would definitely love to see Boston vs GSW...but it's just not fun to watch being the high power chooses who win & loses
Brown has inspector gadget springs in legs
Wtf
Celtics plus referee. Dapak.  Calling Curry a Fouls which is not
Celtics just have dudes!!
Celtics just have dudes!!
Charles Barkley was right, you can't win championship hurling threes all day!!! LOL
brown and Tatum are Jordan and pipen tandem.
They need KD
Man...people have been acting like its in the bag for the Warriors but ive been sayin from the start they got a helluva chance. Bostons a great team with great players and a  great coach. The same is true for the warriors but theyre small and unathletic compared to the celtics. Wiggins is very athletic but besides him im not sure.....
Absolutely zero sympathy for these clowns who knew they had to recruit Durant (allegedly through a sobbing Draymond Green) to have any chance of beating LeBron and a fully healthy Cavs squad.
golden state need to T up
Defense wins championships. 🫣
I told my cousin before the series started that Jalen brown will win finals MVP.
Jaylen Brown is a bad, bad man.
Dreymond was getting handled by Celtics center
Wheres bo cruz?
Green can’t stick brown 😂😂
Love it when the warriors get a good ol fashion azz woopin
this series is playing out similarly to OKC vs GSW in 2016. the celtics better close out when they get the chance and keep the pressure on. they know they can’t turn it over but they have the advantage in terms of defense, size, athleticism, hustle. warriors if they get hot (like they have in 3rd quarters) can end it quick so celtics have to stay locked in for 48 minutes and even twice as locked in during 3rd quarters
Celtics is getting the championship
Draymond thought he was playing football 😂😂
CELTICS FAN HERE FOR LIFE... BOSTON STRONG 💪
The GSW better win
BROWN FOR MVP
Finally a real competition
The Warriors need to make some SERIOUS defensive adjustments if they are going to win this series. Relying on Steph and/or Klay to have big shooting games cannot beat a all-around team like the Celtics who have shooters, defenders AND playmakers. Celtics played an all-around game tonight
A pick and roll with JT and JT would be elite because they literally have to double both.
I'd like to watch this series and enjoy it but it's already been spoiled by Steve Kerr and political happenings in America. Then to top it off I have to hear a woman simply reporting what others have  supposedly said. Hearing a woman's voice while you watch a men's basketball game is the most irritating! ABC
Celtics ..!👍😀
The Celtics are known for their defense.
Marcus smart==trash
Dang, Boston ain’t no punks 👏
Great win Celtics,and #LetsGoCeltics
Celtics bringing it home for sure
Smh this is scripted
Were was bill
Golden State: woot woot pull over that ass too fat..
The true tough players need not to injure a player just to make their contenders slow down and chance for them to win.. Players who intentionally doing dirty tactics moves is a cheater a true cheater.. May the best team wins without dirty tactics moves not by win because did a dirty tactics to injure a player for them to be slow down and defeat the injured player's team
The football from Horford to Brown was stellar.
Whaaat???? 2010 NBA finals Celtics beat Lakers how did that happen 🤦
They gone make this finals look good but bos  not going to be the champ
Where's everyone saying Warriors in 5 @?
9:35 Curry holding his bruised ego...
Celtics went against all the hitters & ready for the warriors.  Warriors went against injury teams & don’t know to do against this healthy young team. 😈
Why is Al Horford and His father the same age??????
I easily think the celtics had the toughest road to the finals out of any of the playoff teams this year.
I miss seeing the Bucks in the finals. Golden state was down 114 to 100 with 2:19 left and Golden State sits down all of their starting players?? Whatever happened to playing a full game like the Bucks did against Boston...(never quit attitude goes a long way)?? Curry proved you can score a lot of points quickly in the third quarter with the seven-point play. A team that quits is destined to lose! The Bucks took Boston to 7 games without  Middleton otherwise it looks like they would have been repeats!
Draymond Green even sometimes he   is bad but he doesn't do such dirty play that will injure a players like Marcus Smart and Al Horford and Giannis is doing that they intentionally want to injure a key player a superstar
did draymond get any blocks this game? his defense felt sub par
Offensive boards do it all...
Boston Celtics a true cheaters!! It is clear Al Horford intentionally want to injure Stephen Curry 2 times this game 3.. Last March 2022 Marcus Smart lands on Stephen Curry foot that injured Stephen Curry... Al Horford and Marcus Smart deserves to be injured for real we hope next games this finals they will be injured and that is called bad karma pay
These videos NEED more defensive highlights. Then people can see what makes the Celtics so elite.
Celtics in 6 !!!  Dubs looked defeated amidst subpar performance from Green/Poole and better coaching by Celtics. Time to break up the Dubs hype machine.
fuck. celtics only 1 superstar and they are super strong. This is so unexpected.  Reminds me of 2004 detroit pistons 💪😎
bad defense by the dubs
After game 3 loss of gsw, we will witness  one biggest turnaround in nba history.💪💪 golden state in 6
Except for as usual Curry! A seven-point play my goodness
Green needs to start “instigating” again. Pivotal to GS winning when the opponent is frustrated AF.
Cetics is a whole team full of dogs and giants. This Celtics team has been for real for years even back to tatums rookie year. Jalen brown and tatum has taken curry and KLAY spot as best 1-2 punch in the game of basketball. They beat you from inside and outside and BOTH will lock you up on defense. BOTH are clutch and cold as ice. BOTH are mature and make really good decisions. Then smart enforces everything. A much more impactful draymond green. He can score on both ends (worked for years to develop). He’s clutch and isn’t scared and is an absolute menace on defense and the boards. Let them go to Robert Williams. Not a lot of ability on offense but he rebounds and defends every inch of the paint. Al horford a seasoned vet. Shoots inside and outside and is a good shoot blocker defender as well. Pritchard little self comes in and defends and has great success with any unit he’s on with. He plus the game with passion and the right way. Derrick white is an underdog who earns every penny and takes no days off. And is a starter on another team because of his defense alone, but can also put the ball in the hoop. The best decision maker on the team. The Celtics are the best TEAM in basketball. They beat kd and Irving, joe and harden, bam and Jimmy butler. That’s a lot of star power. Something the warriors didn’t do in their tenure at the top. This team is incredible.
Who needs an all stars to win a title?  Lebron "Only me!!!" Epic failed...
to all the idiots who thought the warriors had this in the bag or this was going to be a easy series, here is your proof.  Celtics have been my pick since they beat  the bucks. they may still end up losing but I'm sticking with them 🏆
Anong ginagawa mo sa player mo
Kerr wtf are u doinnnnggggg why is curry guarding tatummmm dat should be wigginssss curry should be guarding smart tatum just blowing past curry u gotta gave a big on him keep looney in the paint green on brown and curry on smartt omgggg
Warriors in 6
Jaylen for finals mvp yah? Nba all star snub
Too big too strong too smart. Stephanie and the dubs had no chance. GSW would have to go big on the lineup next game. The splash sisters are exposed.
You win championships by playing good defense & rebounding, Let’s Fucking Go Boston!!!
Yeah!!!!!!!!! Go Boston!!!!
Tatum & Brown & Smart!!!! Celtics going to put a dagger in the Warriors on Friday son, LFG Boston!    My guy Smart dropped 24 points & helped fuel a defensive effort that put the clamps on the Warriors & held them to 11 points in the 4th quarter, that’s the third-fewest in a finals game in the shot clock era!! I think the difference was the Celtics D & the Windex, Celtics outmuscled & cleaned the glass for a 47-31 rebounding advantage
☘
This is not a competitive game. Raining 3s and no defense, still 90's is the best.
I'll just say Golden State take a rest a this Game they didn't contest in shot and being aggressive on defense 🤣🤣🤣and just wait on Game 4 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Draymond literally got thrown around like a kid and was completely shut down from doing anything. Williams isn’t you, he is better than you 😂
Let’s give Jaylen Brown his blowjobs. Man set the tone for the entire team early in the game and you could see the swagger spread to everyone else.
The problem with Boston all of them can grt Buckets, is not like the previous years that the Warriors were facing. That has to relied on one person. Boston is unique
If the Warriors don't tighten up..... 😡
Coach for warrior need to leave his key players in  all times in The third and fourth quater do not matter if in fowl problem, could have won Wednesday night game
Everyone calling the Warriors “OVERRATED” are salty laker fans😂😂 like bruh they’re in the finals and y’all couldn’t even make the PLAY IN😂😭💀
The last time I watched a 🏆 game in Boston was with my Lakers losing the title!? Whe on earth am I cheering on this team to be competitive?? 😔
Brown looks like short version Kawhi….
The Warriors didn't come out to play,, The Warriors didn't come out to playeeaa 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Hortford intentionally sat on Curry's legs to hurt him not to go after the loose ball.
Damn the Celtics won this game I hope GSW wins the next game.
Draymond is too small to guard the center around the basket.
i want al horford to get a ring, he deserves it.
This series is defined by whether the Warriors can do better in the 3rd quarter than the Celtics in the 4th quarter.
My nigga Last days on court side
No No Golden State started streaky and Boston was making the shots and Golden State caught the lead for a second Smart Brown was shooting and going through the lane and Curry was hitting the three and he was in foul early in the game he had to do layup he didn’t want to foul out and Drayon his head wasn’t in it but he got together for the while and Clay Thompson was slightly off he could have gone hard he didn’t want to risk it yes this Friday we have to get that lead early and close at before half time.Golden State was playing catch up ball 🏀 that kind of hurts them Game 3
Warriors are front runners… not sure why anybody is surprised they are crying like spoiled children as soon as the deck ain’t stacked for them… klay Thomason is also a shell of himself now a days.. maybe put it on the floor and stop bitching.. and draymond literally cussed in front of his kid in this post game presser then tries to call out fans gtfo 🤣🤣🤣
Lol. They just win coz of Scott Foster (soft calls on curry to make him bench earlier) and Ring was adjusted by Height. Cheating is the 🔑 to Win. It's a RIGGED!! Cost game by Referees and Celtics 🤣🤣 👏👏👏👏
What they are really doing is building a Celtics vs Lakers comeback rivalry
This Boston team one of the best teams ever...
that last block by brown got me hyped
We bullied draymond this whole game 😂
This game is another instance of the Warriors needing Kevin Durant to go 4th quarter takeover mode because 11 points in the 4th quarter is pathetic. Like u Warriors fans had the nerve to say that u guys don’t need KD.  Like this game kind of proves it.  If y’all replaced Wiggins and Poole with KD, then the Warriors would win this series in 4 games.
Damn Celtics really know how to injure the best player every round, the Celtics are a joke and don’t deserve to be in the finals
brown for finals mvp
Warriors play so boring
Boston powers up when they play at home
now that the nba got their guaranteed 6 games i bet the officiating gets alot less biased and we see who is actually better,  curry picked up 3 touch fouls last night while the celtics are allowed to grab, turn, land under him, and constantly smack him with the ball, but smart never gets close to fouling out. the softest fucking foul calls ever and no mention of it
I will never watch a dirty game like this !
An example of complacent is the Warriors working inside their guard office and not be worried about the dangerous raiding Celtics condition outside. "Warriors! Come out and play! Warriors! Come out and play!"
50
Bro the warriors beat they selves an its sad because the Celtics should have blown the warriors out my dubs hung around the Celtics did nothing spectacular warriors in 7 they played horrible last night
Curry is the only player who can take a 3 on a fast break and I’m like ok that’s not a bad shot
Rooting for Celtics . From a Lakers fan 👍
RW3 IS the X factor he played 20 minutes!! TOO many minutes needs to be 14 total minutes especially on short rest!!! FRIDAY
Curry is kinda fragile and dainty.
Robert William lll think he’s slick. The three lll clearly means three blocks.
I wanna put a bet on brown for finals mvp but I don't know if fox bet is gonna have the mvp betting anymore
The Warriors didn't even try they looked disconnected
Celtics in 5
Bruh curry is a bucket
Warriors only scored 4 points after curry hit long 2 with 8 mins left that's sick
Love seeing Brown cook Draymond
not a 100% gsw
Why the fuck they skip the last 2 minutes?!
My man where's Brown ? Curry & Brown made this game 😑
Win or Lose, GSW Forever💙💛🤍
Let's go Celtics
Let's goooo Celtics!!!
Boston in 6
Is Boston really going to win this!?!? I feel like that would make Curry and the rest of the Warriors core look really bad.
You'll know if Boston gonna win by the 3rd if it's a low score 60's and they up best believe you in for a game good stuff Boston.. I'm going for the green.if GSW start shooting they in for a problem.. I hope Boston burn them young boys legs it's their chance to show out. They look good
experience is overrated, the Warriors are deep but aren't versatile. They can't play big and definitely don't have rim protection so they can't counter different styles of attack. Warriors only have shooting and small lineups
i watched the game last night and  i tell you brown went off
lol dramond had 2 points this guy is all talk
Celtics definitely going to make you play defense the whole game and they have so many ppl that can go crazy if they have to. Great team defense and offense
I’m sick of this 3 point basketball!
If Iggy still at his prime? It's all gsw
Good. Steve Kerr is a jackass.
the heads up inbound by Al to Brown in the 3rd made my heart grow 3 sizes.
Draymond be getting abused
I want the Celtics to win this year. But I still have a feeling warriors will be winning it all ! 😌
Boston is a scrappy team
Warriors go beyond plus ultra ❤
Love this Celtics team. You can see the elements of the spurs culture that coach Udoka has brought. Tenacious defense,fundamentally sound basketball, great ball movement. Get that 🏆
Green must come off the bench and poole must start clay off the bench insert looney. Warriors need more hustle to fuel the offense
If it’s not the Celtics then it would of been the heat wining this series as well. Both teams can beat golden state
Brown Tatum...yuck. This is going to be a struggle.
We dropped our shamrocks on em last night😂
I gotta go watch cris smooveeee
☘️☘️☘️
the celtics had good ball.  transition.. ball rotation.. and effective big men to the paint..
✂😞😭😋💅 q😉✂😃🌷
In my opinion, I think the Celtics work better as a team. Curry's got his eye on MVP, which possible has made him a bit selfish with the ball.
Good game Warriors seemed very relaxed while Boston had to fight can Boston keep the pace up while Warriors wait patiently for home game championship win?. Layups
Clowns: east is weak Heat 4 finals appearances Cleveland 4 finals appearances Raptors 2019 champs Bucks 2021 champs And now wait for the celtics to win this series.
Al Horford is a difference maker buckets rebounds loose balls assists steals all in clutch moments & Smart right there with him they slowing the Warriors down all at the right moments Tatum got in his bag in this one & Brown giving them boys tough buckets Williamsx2 & Pritchard playing some quality minutes as well leaving everything on the court I'm feeling this effort
Yes sir
Y’all giving Draymond a hard pass. I know it’s, “not his job to score” but he needs to give you more all around. He kinda looking outmatched
Warriors win is game 4
I think Boston in 7. Their path was harder making them more conditioned to win. They beat an offensively dangerous team in the Nets with defense, battled the Bucks & Heat  to win in 7. Those three are far better than the three teams the Warriors faced this postseason.
why does the celtics coach remind me of suge knight lol he has that mean look.
I forgot the Finals are on
Celtics players contributed well in offense and defense, tatum finals mvp, celtics in game 6
The refs were paid off crazy fouls committed against GST no calls !
Celtics got lucky
GSW need a good Center Player like Mcgee.
Curry balibag tae
One criticism about the Warriors is their slow starts. In these playoffs pretty much the team that has a strong first quarter wins the game. Boston has been consistent coming out strong the first quarter. Game 2 Warriors kept it close in the first and second quarter. Then they pulled away in the 3rd. So, starting out strong and finishing strong is the key.   I’m still with the Warriors. Looking forward to a great game 4.
GSW is not moving off ball, it looks like no one's cutting. Andrew Wiggins needs a consistent jumper.
They all hated on us but we up!!! ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Both teams wanna win so they’re gonna compete every night. This isn’t gonna be a cakewalk even if it goes to 5. I give the edge to Celtics because it feels like there time. Everybody always so obsessed with the past and we want it to repeat itself but there’s always a change. Curry, Lebron, KD they had their turn. All these young players Giannis, JT, Luka, Ja, Zach, Embid needs to leave because he’s wasting his prime youth. But yeah they Hungry asf and with the talent that just coming out every other year eventually the 28-35 year olds or gonna be like elite 6th man and role players only imo
Hell of a series. I see this goin to game 7 but damn golden state is out sized by Boston . But those threes that curry makes is a nightmare against any team especially when klay comes to help out
Fuck the warriors
Celtics only losing theses finals if they crumbled to the pressure of getting closer and closer to the title in short if they choked. Their undeniably more athletic and skilled in all positions. Looks like Jaylen and Tatum learned alot from LeBron attacking the paint in their years of facing him in the eastern conference finals. This series proves that height and strength in Basketball does matter😬
Draymond Green needs to be traded.  They keep saying best defender in the NBA?!  J.Brown was misusing this man.  He so into his BS he was no help to the team.
GS is a clown ass team carried by one of the greatest shooters of all time.
The refs won this game
5:07 that was the play of the game
When you beat the nets and the bucks there ain’t nothing you can’t do Celtics in 5
I'm not a fan of the Celtics at all but I gotta admire how much they fight they have in them to take on Golden State. They're not bowing down at all & giving them a run for their money.
That was a must win they took care of business well done .
Celtics had 8 turnovers and won?  Wow, y'all know what that means then, huh.
Maybe Bill burr is right😅😅😅 I made a wild prediction that the refs will give 2 fouls to steph before the first quarter is over.  Rigged😅 The warriors were playing like they didn't want to foul out steph by the end of the 3rd quarter.  Rigged.  Celtics the entire 2nd half were using dirty tricks like grabbing and elbowing steph on every possessions.  The refs saw those celtics dirty tricks so they just stopped calling fouls on steph.
Warriors are the best 3rd quarter team that’s cool. Celtics are a better 4th quarter team
kudos to williams
Shame the Celtics are resorting to cheating.
Those poor delusional Warriors fans who said Game 1 was a fluke...
Al Horford intentionally tried to hurt Curry the league need to keep an eye on him https://youtu.be/PLw3VTxxlFY
This boston team has so many athletes.  I'm just so impressed how they just fight.
Jordan poole
Brown was the Celtics biggest defensive liability before the series, was quite the opposite in this game
Celtics all day baby we winning this Finals keep pushing
Hey y'all in the nba need to check jaylen brown hes on ped's bruh
That flagrant they called on horford was crap..curry jumped into horford, flailing his leg outward to make contact..IMO
Golden State 3arriors
The warriors need size and athleticism in the paint.
Undeniable that the Celtics gameplan was to be physical and they were way too physical for GS to handle.
Raise the 18 banners 🎋💚☘️🏀
Draymond Green aka Mr. Triple Single: 4 reb, 3 ast, 2 pts
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS!!!
Complete defensive domination!!!
I’m worried about the Warriors defense side of the ball. They got to do better defending them wide open three pointer shots.
The way the Celtics team is playing it's hard to pick who will be the MVP can they give a most valuable player to the whole team
Tatum is going to be a hall of famer. Coming from a bucks fan.
Iso plays exposes the weakness of gsw. Celtics are way more hungrier than gsw for the title. Gsw needs more "D"
6:05 al horford is onto something
It's great to hear mike breen's voice again
Boston in 🖐️
Sa home courts lng nanalo😂
Draymond is just too small. The fact the Warriors made it back to the finals with him is impressive. That 100 million probably could have been spent much wiser.
Take it to curry offensively every game he can’t guard no one on the court!
Nba sucks. No plays just idiots shooting 3s
the more jayson tatum just plays the game and let’s it come to him, the more dangerous the team is.    he will be the best player in the game if he goes with the flow and doesn’t try to force his hand   wanna have mamba mentality, dominate the game even when u don’t score
Might as well call the Warriors , The Golden State "Cowboys" by the way they choked this game!
that play where al chucked it down the court for a full court pass to JB in transition while dray is arguing with the ref made me lol
In all my 57 yrs I've never seen so many "athletes" falling to the ground. Is this what they are teaching in High school and collage now, how to flop? I have no respect for any of these players because they scream like little girls or flail their arms and legs at the slightest touch just to get a whistle. So their sending a message that's it's ok to cheat as long as you win. And speaking of respect, why anybody would bring a child to a NBA game is beyond me when you have fans yelling F-this and F-that when there are kids in the audience. It is definitely END OF TIMES, people just don't care anymore. So sad!
Warriors please get rid of green really my guy u score 2 points
Celtics are having fun
Can't stand both of these teams, but go Cs!
If the Celtics didn’t turn the ball over so much, they would win these games going away. So frustrating.
Draymond out there getting exposed
All these Celtics fans talked about the refs helping the warriors win game 2... celtics had 1 more foul than the warriors in game 2 and only 3 more FT attempts... game 3, Warriors were called for 6 more fouls and had 9 more FT attempts with at least 6 of the fouls for the Warrior's coming on offence resulting in turnovers.  Not to mention Horford pulling a Zaza and stretching his leg under Curry on the 3 plus landing on his leg late in the 4th... so please tell me how the refs helped the Warriors win game 2 but wasnt the reason they won game 3....
Bro Jordan pool is becoming the new curry
The end of era
JB JT RW3 Smaht Grant and Big Al played really well tonight go Celtics ☘️ ☘️ ☘️
awesome win.   will al horford step out on the 3?  When his guy sets the screen, he is constantly hanging inside the 3 point arc.   Curry comes off the screen and takes open 3s.  If he can start stepping further out, Curry will have a tougher time.
CELTICS IN 5!!!
Why it's there no 2022 on the court next to the finals sticker I guess yall want to save on sticker money this year 😆
kitsakit ba no na hahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
IT'S OVER CELTICS 2022 CHAMPS. IM GONNA HANG MYSELF IF THEY'LL LOSE THIS SERIES. ITS OVER BANNER 18th BABBBYYYYYYYY
Draymond is trash and always has been since GSW's earlier championships.  Get rid of him as he's a liability, all he does is cry.  He's one of those guys who just HAPPENED to be in the right place at the right time which's why he won those rings.    Apart from that, GSW has no big men - that's why they're getting stomped.  They're putting all their money on Curry.  Steve Kerr has been getting lucky this past decade because Curry's simply a beast at shooting.  After this series, win or lose, they'll need to make some serious adjustments.  The GSW are HEAVILY reliant on Curry which will ultimately be their downfall.
With Klay coming back from an injury and not being himself, Poole has to step up Big and hasn’t. It’s time for Golden State to look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves how bad do they want this. Curry cannot do all the heavy lifting while the rest of the team plays like minimum salary bench warmers. Someone else will have to step up big in able for Golden State to be successful.
Celtics year 🏆
Boston 4-1
Go Celtics
This finals series is like 2019 Raptors won in game 6. It's over Dubnation let's just accept it, maybe next year. Celtics 2022 Champs!
the fact they dont give tATUM SUPERSTAR CALLS IS bs.  hE WAS FOULDED SO MANY TIMES DRIVING.
Wonderful, great to see GS lose!! Actual old school drive to the basket!!
9:00
GSW defense is just 💩💩💩
Someone is a GSW fan on the @NBA editing team. They were held to 11 4th quarter pts and I think we saw them all🤔
Tatum is not playin look at the poise tho
Bunal y looy .
Warriors have a must win next game or this series is over.. if they do, I have this series going to 7 games, Warriors winning it all and Steph grabbing his first finals MVP (well overdue)
Memo to Draymond Green..."Shut up and Step up...or, Pack up!"
Billion of people will be died in ArmAgedOn, because they WOrship sAtAn D devil, N JEHOVAH God father of Jesus, killed thAt people in the world reAd d proof Jeremiah 25:33, sO, WOrship JEHOVAH God father of Jesus b4 it's 2 late because d end is very neAr
aside from the bandwagon fans in California, is anyone actually hoping GS wins over Boston?
What a game. Celtics are so tenacious. Everyone on the floor plays defense at a high level. The best thing the Celtics ever did was hold on to Marcus Smart. He’s the soul of that team on defense.
Not looking good for GSW😞
Celtics are too tough and too deep for the Warriors.
2 T.O from Smart in the first half scared me a little but we got it done
Hndi aq kmbnsido sa knlang pnalo
Dont expect anything its all warriors.
Keep On Truckin Boston Celtics
I think Jason Tatum is playing very well because golden state is literally double teaming him wanting other people to step up and that's what they're doing and he's willingly passing the ball the warriors will be playing tough for a game for Boston don't lay an egg we want this series to not go back to California but close it out at home
Curry can’t score without a screen. Shits annoying asf.
na whoever put this in 4:39 give them a raise now😂😂
wanna know why GSW are so good in 3rd quarters? cause they cant handle the pressure in 4th. that is why they want to finish the game in 3rd quarter.. said this b4 and say it again this time, curry is not a 4th quarter guy.
If the Celtics don’t turn the ball over they win every game
how about some ads, there arent enough
Green should find a way to score more. 2 points won't make you great unless you have double double 10 assist and 10 Rebounds  Green should focus on playing the Game the right way rather than looking to make dirty play to win
Ayeeeeee 🥰 🥰 Boston😍 we did that 🙌🏽💖Celtics🔥 💃🎶🥳💪🏿❤💯
I think warriors are lost they know
Refs called fouls on Curry in the 1st half is soft AF
GSW fans rn, dubs in 6🤣😭 lmao
Watching horse mouth Green get cooked all game long and still running his mouth is just hilarious. Dude is a certified bum
Brown and tatum get too much hype this was Williams game honestly game 1 was white game
sino dito nag punta kasi wala lang
Spectacular Jayson Tatum... what the hell... killer instinct Mamba Mentality..
Boston Rocks💪💪💪💪💪
Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣
ray allen, garnett, pierce. 😢 big 3
凯子牛逼，格林只会防守有卵用
I dont understand why Dray dont volunteer to come off the bench. I've seen dudes like Lance Stevenson try all kinds of antics and everything on the court that has nothing to do with basketball. It never works. all it does is make your team play 5 vs 4. Then they want Poole to be what he been all year. Well I thought he was starting all year until Dray came along. How you gonna send him to the bench and say go do what you  did when you were starting. Gsw crazy.
as long as boston stays the course and pounds the paint they will win the series. On another note: glad the NBA smartened up and stopped supporting the ponzi scheme known as BLM.
@azure
The only thing that bothers me about this series is when the Celtics get physical sometimes the referees get really touchy with the whistle. Since they don't play defense in the Western Conference like they do the Eastern Conference, sometimes I feel this is a disadvantage for teams that incorporate this strategy
They  simply outplayed GS, like @kazzy official said, this boston team is strange yet good.
I said before they started the series that I believe Boston will win this and handle the Warriors I know it isn't over but the way they did the Heat I know they will win it all in 6 maybe 5.
Williams is the X factor for the Celtics that kid is special he’s like a throwback to Ben Wallace
Where Bo Cruz at?
Crazy to think that people said you could never beat a team like the warriors without your own versions of Steph Klay and Draymond. Well Smart Brown and Tatum are not the same but they fill similar roles and are damn good in the half court defense together. Kobe would be proud of Tatums aggression. As a Lakers fan this is a tough series to watch. I’m personally rooting for Tatum just for the love that Kobe had for him. But I also don’t want the Celtics to have the most championships again by 1. Lol.  Edit: yes I know the series isn’t over and anything could happen. Still pretty cool to see a team handling everything golden state throws at them with poise.
Somebody help CURRY!!!!!!!!! I hate watching superstars struggle its sad
If tatum didn't have this shoulder injury, the celtics would have won this finals easily hands down, but they still will... GO CELTICS!
Giannis and Middleton could’ve beeen Eatin
Job not finished
Robert Williams is there Secret Weapon Bro played really aggressive & I love it His Presence is Huge on Both ends Good Game Boston  👍🏾
celtics rose up and started ballin Curry is such a liability defensively my god
Celtics choked Warriors in 4th quarter. Good job
Bro Celtics splashing 3s every where
This is really showing how much KD really meant to the warriors.... He was definitely the bear player on those teams. If he was still part of the warriors roster it would be golden state up 2-1 maybe even 3-0
Celtic
All I gotta say we all kno da warriors gon win da finals
Horford’s elway toss to brown was beautiful
Hulog!! money making game!
The fact that the Celtics are looking this good in the finals despite two 7 game series in their bag shows you how deep and well oiled their team and system is respectively. Also is a testament to how tough the East was this season!
I appreciate that the producers of these videos are starting to include more defensive plays. I wish they would also include more things like fouls and injuries that are important to the outcome, instead of just made baskets. They are slowly getting better.
THAT WS BEAUTIFUL❕
7:06 how on earth is that not a moving screen on Looney? It's clear as day.
What a win for the Celtics!!!
Sixers can take note…no process necessary to have championship level team. Celtics Are back in the finals before we ever made it 🤦‍♂️
This game was played on my birthday and I’m a Celtics fan
Looney doesnt know how to lob. Yall think he can and he has in the past, but what about now. Now now now now is what we wanna know Exactly. He cant lob. If he could, he wouldve done it more often *shrugs Time for a new center Warriors. Looney had his times to shine but yall really need to replace him. Outta all the centers on the playoffs series, Looney's the least athletic one. Seriously, i mean no disrespect. I'm calling it as it is.
This game was on my birthday
Yet another collapse by curry in the 4th!
Kerr is a TRASH coach when he has to make the right calls against good teams. Hasn’t he learned from these losses he can not sub out Curry with Jordan effing Poo 💩 ! Poo disrupts all the offense with his low iq and super poor defense. Game 1 Poo 💩 came in at the end of 3rd and loses a 12 point lead with a bad forced shot and 2 consecutive turnovers. Game 3, Curry gets the Warriors a 1 point lead after being down 15-17 and what happens, Kerr benches him for that trash Poo 💩 again. Warriors down 11 points when Curry is inserted back into the game.
All the way from Gainesville I hope Al Horford gets his first ring
hard to believe you people are still buying into this...it's not real
Boston players so dirty in there game 3
Does anyone want to admit Jaylen brown is a better all around player then Jason Tatum yet ????? Jaylen Brown should be Celtics #1 option!!
Jayson LeTatum
Glad to see that defense still wins games.  Can’t stand this era of shooting 1000  3 pointers a game.
Jayden Brown for Finals Mvp
Well I figured GS couldn't D like game 2.  It was too draining.  I would suspect that early in game 4, they would try over playing the passing lanes again but as the game progresses they will tire and lose.  Celtics are too big, too talented and too strong. They will win this series and if they keep the team together who knows how many crowns they win.
the warriors almost entirely rely on 3’s and setting screens for steph
ezzz
Boston cheated to this win bro I ain’t got no respect if another team beats the warriors ima start hating them like the raptors like bro I’m so mad the Celtics are trying to kill curry bro don’t even say I’m hatting
The switches on Curry got em good... 😂😂😂
still warriors.
The team that goes to the line the most wins. First quarter, 8 to 1 in Bostons favour in Boston. The WWE has more integrity. Look back to the Miami games where Boston went to the line 38 30 and 23 times in a three game stretch. Miami same games, 14 14 14. Guess what? Boston won. So fixed.
"2 wins away from the title" goosebumps GO CELTICS!!!!!!!!
You cant be a shooter but 1 of the worst defenders and be a unanimous mvp. #30   is Overrated. Muscle memory is your best skill boy.
4:31 why was this a highlight? I was thinking maybe it's a defensive highlight, but, it was a mostly uncontested 3, and, a chase down contest. It weren't no block. Regardless! I shudda watched the game.
Yo idk but yall but Jason.T has been on 🔥  the last couple years , becoming his own superstar for real
I'd believe it was the (Boston celtics defense is what stopped the (Golden state teams to find their way. However! it appears to be that the rest of the (warriors payers aside of Stephen curry Klay Thompson and Draymond green needed an extra help from those other role players.. besides I'd also believe that (Boston wants to wins this NBA finals so bad...I'd just don't know how much can this (Boston team can continue playing defense... but what I'd do know for certain is that (Boston must win game 3... because if they'd don't then the warriors will definitely go back home and win game 4. Because if Boston loses next upcoming game.  The warriors gonna win game 7 at home.. so this is why Boston must win game 4
You can see it Gs just need to play harder the celtics are ok
Celtics are clearly the better team. The warriors won game 2 because of one big quarter.
Celtics could be forming their own dynasty right before our eyes.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅draymon trying his hardest
This can’t be real
Let’s go Celtics and jaylon brown
Celtic will win the championship this year sad to warrior. their prepared for regular season and playoffs not for the final 😂😂😂
8:57
golden state gun grabbers... fsk
I would rather watch Gelo play in the Drew League.
*Padayon lang.*
They called a flagrant on Al Horford for “intentionally landing in steph curry’s space potentially injuring him on a 3” which gave the warriors a 7 point conversion late in the game… the better team at home won, but that’s an absurd thing to call in the finals, especially after last games no call drama.. anyways, bostons crowd one of the best hard nose crowds of all time. I guarantee the “kids” in the crowd were saying fuck dRaymond too. Die hard sports city. I learned the f word in like 3rd grade. Draymonds wife shouldn’t bring her children to hostile environments. I hope they make a chant for her too. Golden state is too soft for Boston. Top to bottom way too soft. To small, to sensitive, too fragile and emotionally damageable.
F the NBA and Lebitch James
CELTICS IN 6
That pass by al
I have to give it to Boston head coach. He’s a genius. His constant on the fly adjustments is just mind blowing. Plan B is not working scratch that, plan Z is next. You might have ✨ stars and super stars but if you don’t know how to use them, game over.
That was a good game
TWO MORE BABY. LETS GET IT. DEFENSE AND THE NEW KING OF THE ASSOCIATION JAYSON TATUM. ALL DAY. C’S IN SIX.
warrior never learn from the past season when comes to the final.
Celtics 🍀🏆 💪🏼Best Team All Around 👏🏼🥳
Great game and great sportsmanship to each team. May the best team win! 🏆
LOVE CURRY 💗
1:51 how is that not 3 sec violation
Dang. The Celtics are playing man. Lakers need to get them next year
Omg I hate these Celetics
Klay Thompson finally had a good game and he had one along with Curry but Green has to find a way score more because the Celtics are not really trying to defend him and because they need more scoring and Jordan Poole for sure has to get it going in scoring, that is what it's all about for him no doubt.   I could also say may maybe the Warriors need to go small ball for the most part throughout this series taking Looney out sacrificing more defense for offense but one thing about this Celtics team they are versatile in their lineups to who they could put out on the court.
3 1 to pag nagka taon sa court Ng golden state Yan tapusin Ng celtics iyak Ang Ang fans Ng warriors nito
The warriors are playing with them yhis is lame the Celtics cant shoot a 3 to save their life
Rob Williams is going to be in contention for DPoY next year. I'm saying it now!
Damn GSW only scores 6 points in the last 8:25 second, lord they had them on clamps
This is political as usual, warriors let the celtics win game 3 played like high school players...This is all for profit,tickets, and tv ratings game 7 definitely warriors
It was Celtics vs refs
If you ask me, Wiggins’s dunk at 3:46 is traveling. I honestly feel like that isn’t called anymore. Three steps without dribbling is traveling and he took 3.
Warriors are too mentally tired. A play like at 5:15 can’t happen in the finals.
Jasun tatum, what a nice performance....hehhehehhehhe
Gs dont lose, please,
The reason why the dubs lost was the rebound game. Celtics with 47 and warriors with 31 and the warriors were playing lazy defense mainly because they were in foul trouble in the beginning of the game. Overall good game but celtics surprising a bunch of people in these finals. Good game Celtics, but GO WARRIORS!!!
9:02 got me so hyped. “GIMME DAT SH*T!”
Nba is over no need to watch anymore
C'mon warriors it's a finals !!!
4-1 goodbye GSW ✌️😆
Lets go CELTICS
Beating the Warriors by 16 after losing by 19 is a hell of a BS ass stat.
Go bean town
the fouls on curry early is frustrating man
Boston put on an interior passing clinic, Warriors looked real slow.
Draymond Green😁 2 points, Fouled Out😂 Draymond Green😁 2 points, Fouled Out😂😂😂
CELTICS in 5 marked my word...
Warriors in 6
Draymond Green is not an elite defender
Poor curry
Grind it boys! Boston
Warriors in the 4th quarter looking pretty suspect
Tangal yabang n 🍏 hahahaha
hilak golden
The Warriors has to work on their Defense when Boston has the ball
I feel like if this was the Durant, Steph teams that this wouldn’t even be this close.  But it’s a different year and a different team.  The Warriors need one more scorer.  Klay is still great but not as explosive as he used to be.  Steph is Steph.  If they had another scorer.  So many years of so many games and playoff games with this core.  If the Warriors are to overcome this, Poole has to be the one to step up for added offense.  I think if Iggy could get some minutes he could make a difference too, even though he’s on the tail end.  It’s unfortunate he’s not able to play the minutes.  Very savvy seasoned veteran with championship pedigree.  Looney has come so far from when he was a Rook.  A lot of positives.
Celtics deserves this championship ring 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️ 🍀 ☘️
Keep it more coming BOSTON Celtic YAY 😁..... Be safe everyone 😃...
Klay Thompsan should be benched son or coached better Nigga jacking up some crazy ass 3's especially in the 4th quarter like he's in a 3 point contest how could you win a basketball game shooting like a lunatic like this
boston gonna win 60+ games next year
should be 3-0....the league wouldnt allow it in game 2
Boston got more tenant no wonder they beat my Miami Heat
Good game. 👏 Boston came to play. Responded like they should have. But it ain’t over until the fat lady sings! Lol Let’s go Warriors!!!!
scripted  na rin ang nba
I think Boston should go after Joel embiid next year
I think this one is going to 7.  Really great competition.  The Warriors dug a hole for themselves that even that 3rd quarter push could help.  Fun series so far.  👍.
2:37
The trophy belongs in Boston 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆
PURPLE N GOLD SOLID NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED OMSIM SAKALAM MAMBA MENTALLY
Yes,bceltic.
The REFS did eveything they could to help Boston Win.. Thank god for slow motion on DVR.. #TheNBAisFixed
YEARS OF THE CELTICS 🏀🇵🇭🏀
Al's Dad is awesome.
at this point brown will win a finals mvp before tatum.
4-1
Still excellent adjustments made at Halftime by Coach Kerr.  Just wasn’t enough tonight.  The Celtics shot out of their minds.  Great game
Video Editor needs to do some double checking
Tatum overrated, drama queen in the making, if they lost they'll blame it on his shoulder, if they win oh my god he played with pain what a player. Please today's players are a bunch of drama queens!!!
Celtics the Dark Horse Team 🔥🔥🐴
Celtics fans weren't cheering Steph Curry's foot injury, they were cheering because Draymond Green fouled out.
Warriors in 6.
Love how’s that offense from the celtics do the job
This series will be over in 5 in favour of Boston and 6 if GSW are lucky.
I'm happy hearing mike breen again. Hehe
Now every Warriors fan crying foul.  Give me a break. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. After game2 every Celtic fan saying refs were on the warriors side. And EVERY warriors fan denying it. But since the warriors lost EVERY warrior fan crying foul now about the refs. 🧂🧂🧂 Can’t have both ways
6:05 such bs that Steph gets these calls 🤣
Tatum was money in that 4th quarter.
Boston been pressing all season and now up in the finals. Nothing against the Warriors good team. This Boston year to get the chip🤷‍♀️🏀🏀🏀🔥🔥🔥
Gotta be honest; this game made me feel a way I've never felt before while watching an NBA game.
Jaylen Brown FMVP no debate!
I can't imagine Californians make the cross country trek to watch them play in Boston. Bandwagon?
Celtics win JB getting finals mvp
When your last name is Green and your oppenent is also green shessh😂😂
Game 1 Boston, 2 GSW, 3 Boston, 4 GSW, 5 Boston, 6 GSW and game 7 the only time that the referees will doing a better officiating 🤣🤣🤣 that's my prediction 😂😂😂
Draymond calls himself the best defender in the League. He did not even guard the best players for Boston
2 more!
I believe in Boston.
woah, the celtics could take a 3-1 lead
The skills of everyone is out of this world.
Looks like they took the lead and never really trailed.
Boston had a good run😈, GS IN 6
Warriors fans what now huh 🤔 Celtics the best team in NBA now .
I never thought Boston be this polish am reality get into the game again Boston is so big over the Warriors don't get me wrong that's a good club but Boston in seven you herd it first.
Did he say Celtic beat Lakers 12 years ago...na bro Celtic beat Lakers 2008 Lakers beat Celtic 2010... what bro drinking.. Celtic beat Lakers 3 game to 2 what u on bro
warriors need to start looking like they want to win the game on the defensive end.
😳
Referees are always hating GSW 😂
5:09 that's clean look👀
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
Poor bandwagons gs gonna lose this year
Hilarious !!! the last home celtics finals game was 2010 game 5 against the Lakers which we won then lost the next 2 but as a kid like 18 we snuck into the garden an actually found good seats lmaoo were coming this year!!!
What a staggering and stifling defense by the Cs.
Defense wins games offense sells tickets
P.
the Celtics just deserve to win they have such good chemistry and overall such a good team with all there players giving it there all
If the Celtics can win one more at home there in great position cause then the series goes GS for one then Boston for one and if there is a game 7 it’s in GS so let’s not end up in that position
Warriors scored 11 points in the fourth quarter😳🤯🤣
Its over for gs Boston 1 quick step ahead
That steel by big Al and the pass to Tatum who then passes to Brown for the dunk reminded me of the 86 Celtics oh the good old days
Boston made the Warriors work for them points all game. That was tough
That’s the way to donut Celtics 2 more and my 6 game prediction is still alive but I feel it’s going to be back n forth till game 7 . I wish they just win the next two so I don’t have to stress
Everybody's acting tough when they're up..... Everybody's acting tough when they're up!!!
Go Celtics! Silence the GSW bandwagon fans for good!
2:28 That's an out-of-shape dadbod right there, when you run and lose your balance like that :D
c’s in 6
Welcome Back Mike Breen. "BANG" is his Signature Catchphrase and Alternatively "It's good"
How to describe Draymond Green in this game? Useless TrashHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I love how nobody is talking about the gs young core anymore 😂 Then a couple of months into next season, they're gonna be saying how they're the future of gs 😂
Jalen brown is just as good as tatum they both are superstars
Should call this Draymond's LOWLIGHTS... All that trash talk for what? Getting blocked and blown by alllllll night hahaha
Draymond needs to Shut The Eff Up and Start playing Defense
Warriors too small too weak inside the paint.
Even curry got lights out, he was eaten by Tatum
BOSTON LANG SAKALAM😆
Boston is the better team. I like that Warriors "fans" are finally toning down the overconfidence. You're no longer facing the weak West.
Celtics in 🖐️
Siba na kamo sa game 4 kan GSW!!!!
Jaylen brown should get finals mvp if the Celtics win his play has outstanding on both sides of the ball
You are just being fooled, warriors will eventually take the crown.
Looser match up ! No defense warriors !
Boston Celtics is very young than gsw
Great game 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

Sige uwi k pag nakahiram ako kày nestor.
Don't worry guys, NBA won't allow this series to end early. They are definitely taking this to game 7.See the refs in action on Friday.
Great Series
3 pointer has ruined the NBA
Shit I’m bout to lose it! It’s been a while since we been here
Dope
All the Celltics need to do is guard 3 point line. And play smart offensively. Attack the basket. And shoot open kick out 3s selectively.All they have is Draymond jumping vertically and watch out for his dirty foul tactics. Keep game close in 4th. Warriors are just a jump shotting team who always benefitted from other team star player untimely injuries. Genrerous calls from ref.Having k.d for 3 years . They are not a dynasty
Well they ain't lose by 19😂😂😂
Grant Williams is Like the drymond Green for the celtics lol
BASKETBALL GODS PLEASE LET BOSTON BEAT GS THIS SERIES AND WIN THE CHIP!!!!! THEY DESERVE IT MORE AND GS FANS ARE TOO ARROGANT AND COCKY
Celtics just play so great as a team. No body out of place.
nasan ang yabang ng gsw
Celtics are crazy lucky and healthy, don’t complain when tatum or hortford gets injured.
when was the last time we had a close game on these playoffs? i gave them a shot this year, NOT ENTERTAINED
Celtics in 6
Lob Williams had 3 steals and 4 blocks. An absolute defensive powerhouse
Ahhhh woke nba being beyond predictable again. Let me guess just take turns swapping wins to get to seven games so the league makes more money lol
They not messing with the Celtics. Draymond lost his heart. That's what happens when you do all the talking and you really not even a better team!
CELTICS IN 5
BOE CRUZ
Steph 2 points and 3 turnovers in the 4th. Gravity must be broken
You people are soo stupid  🙄😒 these games is are rigged Celtics gonna loose
All gsw has to do is win the next game and the momentum can swing their way. All it takes is the right tweaks and gsw can pull out the winner. Yeah 2-2 doesn't seem like much but gsw does have homecourt advantage. Their problem is coming out first quarter and wanting it.
What does curry do well, besides shoot 3's? Don't worry, I'll wait
Yes sir 2-1 way to go Boston
The Celtics are the future. A positionless team. They all look the same. They all can score, rebound and play defense.
07:10 The reaction by Udoka telling Williams to push up is sooo Pop like. Wish he would have stayed to coach the Spurs, hopefully when Pop retires.
Boston must be the champion 2022!
I FUCKING HATE THE WARRIORS 💯
I'm wating for GSW fans alibi. "Not GSW home court blah blah"
IF BOSTON SHUTS DOWN THE WARRIORS IN GAME 4 IN THE THIRD QUARTER, WHERE GOLDEN STATE HAS CONSISTENTLY HAD THE ADVANTAGE, THE CELTICS GO UP 3-1✔CELTICS IN 6 BIH✌🏿
Let go Boston Celtic
DASHAWN WATSIN LUV GOLDEN STATE SHOWERS
When Tatum stops looking for fouls and starts looking to score, then he will be good.
Maybe game 4 is tied at 2-2 then warrior need to win the 2 homecourt
CELTICS IN 6 IS WHAT I'VE SAID FROM THE JUMP 💯BE IT MIAMI OR BOSTON  THE CHIP WAS STAYING IN THE EAST✌🏿LFG BOSTON. WHOOP THAT TRICK🙏🏿
At 5.56, why does the defender welcome the pic, even intentionally goes into it rather than fight around it? Weak…
2 more Celtics , 2 more.🔥
Golden State is weak asf, lol
God dang man I really wanna see splash bros pull it off, just for legacy. But Celtics  looked too good at end of the game.
2 more wins, can you believe it?!
"Draymond Green had two more points than a dead guy."
Shit getting a lil spooky for warriors!!👀
☘☘☘☘
..
I’m going for Boston but there’s STILL NO SAMN REASON FOR KURRY TO BE THIS KOLD🥶
Draymond had 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 points. His defense also sucked. He was the factor tonight. He was not who they need him to be. Steph saved them offensively many times.
510 THAT PASS THO! 👀
I've said it all along, if not for the refs. Gsw are just softies, looney best defender, dre is a muck up artist supported by refs, they are a potent offense but that's it. If the refs didnt gv the constant blatantly moving picks they are midlevel team.
The best of boston celtics..
Rebound wins the game.
Lakers 4 life! But this Celtics team is nice.
Boston vs a.i
You know Shannon is going to tear Skip a new one on set today. 😂😂
Better defense and better bigs are why the Celtics are beating the Warriors.  Rebounding down low and having some sort of an offensive presence close to the basket still holds value in basketball even though teams are just jacking up a million 3 pointers now.  That fundamental will never change.
GO CHIEF.
Draymond is not HOF in my opinion.
If you just watched this Boston team this year, you just didn't know how far they have been cooked...Many think that GSW has the better experience in this match but that's not true... This Boston team has been tested deep in the playoffs few years back...Now it's their time, their prime...Like the Spurs, they have been molded well...They seems just to eat the whole lunch of GSW...😅
Jackson: Grown man move. Mama! There goes that man. Breen: Bang! Brown lighting it up from down town. van Gaundy: I didn't like the shot eventhough they could go 2 for 1.
Almost a perfect game from Boston. Going up 2-1 against a more experienced team is huge. Was expecting more energy from the Boston fans tonight.
The guy on the right of this thumb nail looks like that one guy who always tryna still Popeyes girl
Referee's couldn't save they asses twice in row
D-raymon got cooked by everybody in this highlight.
Looks like GS is really moving slow reacting on D.
Warriors lack a real center
Crise climatique > basket, si nous nous soucions des prochaines générations de personnes Climate crisis > basketball, if we care about the next generations of people at all
Golden state too small, boston just need to defend the 3 play bully ball and take advantage of the mismatches and this series is over.
Lakas
celtics play always against on curry.  😂
Sports lang unta wala lang sapakin
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉🎈 well done Boston!!!! It’s not easy,but I always expect this results Love ❤️ 💕 ❤️
Big L for Warriors and its fans
Bronsexuals having a field day 😂😂😂 Must be some tough times for they team to be irrelevant
Their head coach ain't no joke bro the Celtics that is 😎
Congrats Los Angeles Memphis Dallas Celtics hahahahah
I’ve said it since the beginning this postseason on YouTube and I’ll say it again for the 16th time: another win for #24 mr. Sam jones!!!! The number on our jersey this season.
Ime Udoka has truly turned the Celtics into a well oiled machine. These dudes look really good.
I can't believe how good all these guys are at hitting 3's. It's like Karl Malone's Utah Jazz vs... Karl Malone's Utah Jazz. Except Karl Malone's Utah Jazz would smoke these teams because they could go extra hard in the paint with Michael Jordan's Bulls. But these guys are actually better at hitting 3's than John Stockton. Sorry, I've been out of the loop for a really long time lol.
Making the right read is the 🔑👌☘️
Celtics in 7
Jalen Brown MVP
Adjusted ring height, Celtics good at injuring other teams. Trash team
Damn warriors deadass bout to lose the finals to an unproven young team shits so funny
Warriors not beating Celtics
7:32 this Jordan Poole play is DISGUSTING 🤌🏽 I love basketball
It cant be Curry all the time. He needs support in scoring, passing, rebounding and defense. Without these, Celtics will have a walk in the park to close this out on Game 5 or Game 6.
Not much on Warriors defense
Those bigger bodies of celtics its going to take a toll on warriors. Curry cant gaurd tatum
If Curry has one off night….Celtics win by 35 points. Boston just simply has too many weapons.
All the warrior Stans... crying 😢 😭 😢 😭 😢 😭 😢
Boring
Gotta give this one to celtics man they played great i still hope warriors in 6 or 7 but man its hard to beat this team especially at their peak level of basketball
I notice when warriors made there runs its usually just getting and making 3s. Like their 3Q in game 2 was mostly a bunch of deep 3s that went in. While boston when they go on runs they are doing a bunch of everything, swinging the ball to the open man, attacking the basket, just the whole 9yards in than some. They just look better than the warriors to me. The warriors fought back in took the lead after being down double digits and boston somehow still beat them by double digits.
Some people thought this was going to be a walk in the park and the Celtics are looking 👌🏾 next game is huge for both teams. I would like to see Wiggins get his 💍 but Tatum deserves his 💍 too 🤷‍♂️ lets see what happens ✌🏾
Let’s gooo Celtics
So good to have the trio of BREEN, JACKSON, AND JEFF BACK. Especially Breen!!!
Trash Game😂😂😂😂
Let's go C's
You gotta admit that the Warriors are scary when they play. 10 points feels like nothing to this team. They catch up quick. Celtics gotta keep pumping out points or Warrior will dominate. It's gonna be a series....
Wow draymond green struggling big time
WARRIORS
Need wiseman back protect the pain green looney so fuck8ng soft n trashh
Boston is taking notes from LeBron.... attacking steph's defense off the switch
Observations  Curry has no defense..he was eaten alive  celtics... Unselfish basketball by boston.no forced shots and finding the open man. Donkey was overrated self peoclaimed defensive player..he was eaten alive by jahlen brown on isolation plays... Outhustle... Curry has no help other than klay.. Poole is choking on finas.... Curry is the best shooter in this finals but boston is the best shooting team in this finals
I like celtics.. no true PG but they mindset,communication and confident to win a championship is the key.
GS callin boston crowd classy. Draymond only got what he deserved
O gsw fans nasaan na kayo mga bobo bugok 🖕🖕🖕🖕feling champion na kayo my pa one plus game pa kayo bobo
At this point its a battle of Coaches whoever get to whom wins this series.
It's this the new school taking out the old school.  I am old lol
Dramond Green is a liability on defense!
Go warrior
The celtics was very talented and very young team only the bucks with middleton can match up this elite celtics line up !
problem is there are too many curries in Boston
I told yall the warriors need KD
Why do they make a big deal about the C's not losing back-to-back games in the playoffs? Neither have the Dubs. Dubs have also won a road game in every playoff series during the Steph/Klay/Draymond era.

Boston better be careful they shoud've win game 4 because if they don't, the momentom will turn in favor of warriors, because game 5 and 6 are warriors homecourt.
warriors are playing with their food too much... its gonna hurt them in the end.   fuck em! just sweep them  Celtics  BOZOS!
Hope horford will get injured.
Can we at least get some 3-pt shots in this game? We need more of those these days
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Steph is a softee and showboater and frontrunner that crumbles under pressure. Ina keep saying it until they lose this finals. I hate softees and showboaters that act like they are more than what they are. I beat too many people up like that growing up to humble them. Curry needs to shoot his soft ahh threes and run down the court like tim duncan and id have more respect for him. I have no respect for him because his ego is too big to be such a small player that plays so soft and non physical. Id be wanting to go in the ring and duke it out to prove whos toughest and who has the right to dance and shimmy and all that lame crap man. Thats disrespectful. No having respect for your opponent. I aint never play in a basketball game and a dude dancing and all that crap cuz he know if he did hed get locked tf down or fouled up. Straight up. I miss the OGs that woulda put him on his a$$ You can be great and still be humble. Even michael jordan didnt do all that crap. Thats what made him even greater. Wasnt no getting too high when you up or too low when you down. Thats curry right. there ....mentally weak. You all will see after he takes this L. Punk behind steph
Curry's defense is straight trash
Warriors in 10
That’s golden state game plan give Celtics 2 win then close out the game
THE CELTICS SMELL VICTORY  I REMEMBER THEY HAD THE 76ERS NUMBER
The Warriors will only win one more game back is San Francisco., Celtics in 6
This is are year Celtics in 6☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Celtics for the Win!!!
Really nice game! Lets go warriors!
Forget about warriors loosing did yall see that shot by steph curry at 8:28 like how did he do that 😳  like AMAZING SHOT
Celtics will win the title...see the momentum....if Celtics win in game 4 to get the 3-1 lead in 90% sure Celtics win
Game 2  Cs should have been  got the w thier leading Up to second Quarter ,but on the third warriors'S shooting Bursted out while Boston committed some turn overs plus a poor scoring ,that's why Warriors blown them out,In this game they able to maintain thier compossure Gs made a comeback  wich made the mommentum shifted on  warriors side but still thay able to lessen that mommentum by maintaining  thier lead even just one possision before tha third Q was over, that's what they should maintain don't let warriors blow them in Third period  if they able to to that they  will again get the W for  the next two series.
super flapping by curry can't help
Steph not playing 40 mins is worth them losing the whole thing in my opinion. Poole not being able to defend doesn’t matter if you lose with him riding the bench anyway. Klay shooting that many 3s is not nice on my eyes and Draymond has been trash. Finally Wiggins, Wiggins will give you his normal 17-18 ppg smh.
GSW look so tired on the court.
at 1:41  if someone ask what Championship basketball should be? This is the beauty of ball movement and unselfish play.  at :09:02 this is what defence should be. To me it is basketball at its purist form.  Celtics in 6 if they continue this way....  the desire it there.
Let’s go Celtics even tho the finals looks rigged these days
When JT put that ball on the ground and attack the basket face up,Golden State dont have an answer...
Celtics in 5 if gsw don't step up and play they own game.
I like How Boston Executes the Offense in the 4th Quarter..  Anytime You See Curry Standing In Front Of You Take Him To The Bucket and Score On Him.. Curry Is TRASH On Defense..
boston champeons
CELTICS IN 6
Jayson Tatums growth as a playmaker against the constant doubles and blitzes has been a large part of the jump in the Celtics success. I remember all the playoff series before where he struggled and would commit costly TOs when rushed in the PnR. He still makes mistakes but he is truly making teams pay for doubling him with good, timely and confident passes.
Stephs wondering if he can take Lebron up on his offer now
Horford destroyed currys leg is the mvp
Great game
hahahahaha
👍🙂
It feels like this was the suns vs spurs way back in mid 2000s. Offense vs defense.
Both of these teams got something to prove, that’s why this series has been mad dope to watch.
boston at 6
Step said he in his prime.... celtics say WE IN OUR PRIME.... Warriors looking old this may be they last chance.... Come on klay go to the lakers lol
hahaha..saan na yung yabang mo curry at jordan pool sa game 2 ang angas niyo kanina hilaw kayo nyo..hahaha
I am warriors fan but I think Boston is gonna win the championship 😢
that was a tough loss as a warriors fan, hope we can bounce back. I'll take this L and prepare for game 4. GGs C's great defense!
Game 1 Basketball, G2 Brawl Ball, G3 Basketball.  Hey, its nice to have it back!
Green not having any offense has caught up with him. And besides everybody knows the warriors success story to win. Curry runs around screens all night looking for three pointers.
Robert Williams was making draymond look small out there
Draymond need to stop doin all that ESPN ananlysitc act n need to focus on hooping
Great to have Mike Breen back. Best voice of basketball.
Warriors really came back after being down 18 and showed their tenacity in this game. They always run out of gas in the fourth quarter though…
Congratulation Boston Celtics is not going to be given to you you have to take it
Celtics looks so good. If they get this ring imma be so happy for the whole team but especially horford, jaylen and Jason. They really are playing great basketball as a team. Celtics in 6.
2 more !!! Get it done!!!
Warriors Fans,Come Out And Plaaayyy 😂
The most boring finals?
Give brown his credit if jt a superstar jb a superstar dude got hella defense and is offense is just as good maybe a little lesser but not by much.... Finals mvp
Curry always doing that retarded shoot and fall crap
nba champ boston celtics
I’m only 6
That inbound pass from Horford to Brown was insane. 🔥
Homegrown teams been eating these past few years?!?
Game changer, brown ain’t scared of Draymond Green, clear out and attack
Defence win championship!
Celtics again
So composed. And the effort!! My god
Draymond Green got more fouls than points and assists combined. This dude is useless af.
The C’s look hungry while the Ws look tired
Welcome back MikeyB! Good to have the familiar Finals voice back in the booth
They were attacking golden state players in the finals Boston lost in my mind
Boston is just relentless. I see my Warriors getting overwhelmed. Again, great defense wins this Championship.
Celtics beat warriors lead series 2-1
Draymon selling
If Boston bigs show high on the screens…this series is over…Al Horfords’s laziness almost cost them the game
Curry choker 😁😁😁
nets. bucks. miami.  next is gsw . grats boston
2016 cavaliers came back
curry threw this game away SAD
Larry birds team
Celtics will close this out Game 6 in Boston
https://youtu.be/D1er7eD61Dc
I sure hope there would be a basketball player in the NBA with Red as his last name... Or Blue maybe?
They tryna push this series into 7 games....but still GSW in 7
Theres no I in the word TEAM boys!
All I heard in the beginning was.. "wArrIoRs iN fOuR" 🥴😂
if the refs are really by your side, you can definitely win the game.  that's what happened here. If you will watch the replay, you will see lots of missed calls. when the boston was defending, the refs were not calling fouls even jalen brown was grabing their shoulder to have an extra lift to contest layups from the warriors which makes their defense looks strong. of course they were not getting any fouls from refs hence they can do dirty defense.  on the other side, the warriors cant harden their defense as the moment their skin sticks to Celtics, the ref will call it a flagrant foul immediately. we all know the reason is because rhe warriors are getting old and the nba needs a new young cash cow the will give them millions for many more years. its just a cycle.  nothing new in the nba.
Boston is Hungry, you can see it in them.... Good Games
Gsw will win game 4, celts game 5, gsw game 6, celts game 7.
Everybody said,warriors will sweep Celtics. Now it's 2:1. What's next??? Warriors in 6??? Or maybe Celtics in 5. Or Celtics in 6???haha
GSW just gotta take game 4 and this series is back to square one. This game is basically a repeat of game 1, GSW took over in the 3rd and Celtics shut em down on the 4th.
GSW fans before the finals: GSW 4-0 straight! GSW fans after game 1: 4-1 for GSW! GSW fans after game 2: We are just getting started🔥 GSW fans after game 3: 4-2 for GSW!
The Celtics core(Tatum Brown Smart) been together since 16/17 along with Horford(left and came back) so they are young but their chemistry is on point and with the Savvy coach Udoka bring this feels like their year
Kerr has to make lineup adjustments to take the game out of the refs hands and their bad calls by playing Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins and Looney or Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins and Greene, because Celtics can't "full Deny" Curry in these circumstances. Dubs gave away the first half screwing around playing GP, Jr., and it cost them. Let Draymond mess with young, rookie Celtics who show bad body language when all the ref calls don't go their way and get arrogantly mad thinking their better than old, veteran Dub players.  .
Celts in 5 👋
Dremond useless asf
Horford à true og exposing draymond green low key
These ghost fouls SMH
DUA LIPA
GSW easy to beat,celtics in 5 or 6..
this one is on Kerr. He has this great habit of taking out players who are hot (Curry in the third quater) I know he got 4 fouls but come on man.
not saying this because I’m a Celtics fan, I give credit where it’s due but the Celtics deserve this championship more than any other team. They work harder, they share the ball and everyone puts in an equal amount of work and that’s what the game is all about. Not just relying on a few star players. With the Cs you can count on all the players to show up when it’s most needed.
Bruh how is Curry a PG and had 2 assists...
The 2 teams shot about the same but the C's were +9 on the off rebs and -4 on turnovers and thats gets you 13 more shots and there's your game.
Jalen Brown eliminated Kerr's Rodman-esque strategy in Draymond Green.
Curry is a defensive liability.
What Jaylen Brown has been too this Celtics team is incredible but Tatum will get all the love tomorrow
Uh oh Dwaymont what happened. Little btch
If the celtics win the next game they got a ring
Refs were x-factor in Celtics win not calling  "Delay of Game" Technical Fouls on Celtics for repeatedly grabbing ball after they scored to prevent Warriors quickly inbounding ball  for fastbreak, because they are obviously in favor of East coast Celtics.  Even so, Dubs have to  execute and make easy shots to get more "And 1" shots as they missed alot in this game, and they have to trap Tatum and Brown on perimeter to prevent "High Pick & roll" switches forcing Curry to guard Tatum or Brown.
Bro I love how people calling cs dirty but they ain’t throwing cheap shot all playoffs like that. But gsw a dirty team, green ain’t a player Hess there to throw an hurt players, karma a bitch curry got hurt on a regular play.
Ngayon ka mag ingay draymond. Puro ka satsat  wala ka namang ambag kulangot. Kung d sweswertihin si curry nganga kayo. Wag kang feeling elite tungaw. Pwet mo blue.
Just like the Miami series everyone's fooled. The Warriors have won 2 quarters of basketball the Celtics have won 8 and two are a wash. These aren't equal teams. Ones a better team. Clearly. All u have to do is watch and not be a Homer
#paulpierceforever lol
Legends vs Rising Stars. Celtics' Defense is on another Level🔥 Al Horford is the happiest guy here, Looking at his lil brothers slowly becoming a stars...
Can we please stop calling dreymond an Elite defender? Jaylen could've put 60 on him tonight if he wanted. The dudes old and can't score he's in the twilight just stop
dray should be benched let kuminga play and let steph play. Whenever Steph pulled out on the court before the end of the 3rd he got out of thr rythm and the next  thing you know the Celts are leading.. Boston is so good in the 4th quarter.  Still i see this going 7 games and can go eother way.
Boston made it difficult for GS but I think the Warriors beat themselves in this one. Too many mistakes on rushed and errant plays for no reason. Also, Kerr takes out Curry to end the 3rd when he is on FIRE?  That’s bad coaching if you ask me. That’s how you lose games.
12 yrs is enough!!its boston time !2-1.game 4 at boston  again..it's scary for gsw...
State in 6
The Warriors are 🤴s of the 3rd quarter...but they're also the 🤡s of the 4th quarter.
Boston got size, and this highlight shows it! Warriors getting dummied all around! JB gotta keep goin at it! Green cant handle him! gsw center is ass, too slow and always on foul trouble! lots n lots of weakness! lmao poor klay thinking he still got it 🤣 JB swatted that ball to another dimension 🤣🤣
Go Celtics! This is coming from a Spurs fan.
Celtics will win the next 2 games. Defensive and offensive plays are to much for the Golden state to defend. Draymond is to small to get boards especially when Horford and Robert Williams are in the game.
Rigged
Rigged
GSW DIDNT PLAY ANY SMOTHER DEFENSE
Modern basketball is terrible, if you had to take a shot for every WIDE OPEN 3 in this game, you'd die, there is literally no defense being played, the NFL is scripted, no doubt about it, NBA is starting to look that way as well, this is a complete joke of a game, its like watching someone play 2k.
in I'll}
Al Horford got some good decision making on the count
It won't be peaches and cream for the Warriors if Celtics continue to play with same energy
They should guard them like the pelicans guarded the suns
Brown’s effort level…..he’s for real
this is over Celtics will be the Champion.
Draymond at Center ain’t working like the Warriors want it to. Celtics got a lot of size and talent on the squad. 🏀
now thats a center robert should be playing more time in the next season.
Steph curry getting hot 🔥 Kerr : Letme benched him 🤣
I can't wait for the Celtics parade celebration!!!
I smell something new history record...
Jaylen brown so underrated
draymond green is unbelievably useless and toxic, and Kerr keeps indulging him.
Owww yeahhhh!!!
Go celtics🔥
The NBA now is all about 3pt.shots omg cant even see anymore hype from fastbreak layups/dunks,post up and a good star matchup fighting and driving under the rim.
Points in the paint tho
Rename this video to draymond green lowlights and it would make more sense
Celtics are too big Marcus smart has improved tremendously as point guard plus they just abusing curry everytime on the switchs and tatum finally making good passes instead of forcing it all the time
Robert Williams is really scary in the paint area as a defender.
I think Boston got the Championship this season and I think GSW lost in game 5 in their home court.
fucking adds
@8:28 that Steph back 3 (or long 2) was so hard.  Play of the night for me
never thought I’d ever root for celtics to win
steph is a FRAUD
The Celtics played very well, but were helped along the way with the many calls for them and many NON-CALLS that would have been against them. I may be biased, but I do think that the NBA has something to do with the officiating and how calls are made.  The amount of money involved for each game is too much for them to ignore.  I have a feeling (If I'm right) that the next game will favor the Warriors to make it 2-2.  This series will most likely go to 7 games...
There was no reason for steph to have four fouls, the refs were absolutely terrible this game. It was a tale of two ends of the court, steph would get leveled and nothing, then at the other end someone would get tapped and there'd be a foul. I'm not denying that the celtics are a good team and that there weren't missed calls against warriors players. But it's really hard to watch when the same things are happening at both ends and the resulting calls were differing. These are the two best teams in the league and it'd be really interesting to see them go head to head in a reasonably reffed game, I don't care if there are calls or not but have it on both sides of the ball. I'm not worried about the celtics winning a game or two, but I'd like to see it without terrible calls. While at the same time I'd like for players to be fined for flopping then bitching at the refs (that goes for both teams), is it so hard to want to watch a basketball game rather than a bunch of grown men complaining?
Put MOSES MOODY IN!!!!!!
dray vs the world. Boston plz win, can't see this douche get another ring
Man the way  Grant Williams be getting under Draymonds skin 🤣
The 76ers passed on Jason Tatum for Markelle Fultz!!!!🤯 And they traded Mikal Bridges to Phx for who???  Imagine Embiid, Tatum, Simmons, Bridges & Maxey on the floor... Don't trust the Process🚫
That’s a dubb
Congrats boston 👏 💪
Chambahan nyo pa uli sa game 4.
It really shows that all the mavs needed to beat the warriors was a true center, the Celtics have that and warriors haven’t found the answers yet, mavs get a good center and they will be in the finals next year
Somebody told Robert Williams that Draymond CANT hold him 🦾👶🏼
Hate after game 1 people still have the C’s no chance to win the series, then after game 2 everyone acted like their prediction came true. What’s their excuse now?
nice
Dubs will be back.. This game was not their usual
Cldnt be more proud of this Boston team … Not even for makein the finals and over comeing all they have . But for simply being a TEAM !
steph is a liability on defense and draymond looked terrible tonight
☘🍀LETS GOOO!!🍀☘
Well that was that
Al Horford making big passes damnnnn! 😮‍💨
everybody laughing at me for saying celtics going to win this. celtics play defense! all 5 of the starting 5 got a vote for DPOY! take that for data
While I’m happy the Celtics won I’m worried about poor Klay Thompson. Imagine hearing cussing at a sports game. It’s almost to much to think about. Hopefully he can find his way through this difficult time. I mean did Draymond Green Cuss right in front of his son after the game sure but how dare those Boston Fans say naughty words.
i hope celtics win
How much longer can the Celtics shoot with such ridiculous accuracy?  I'm still betting on Golden State to pull this one off.
Wala na warriors finish na kayo 😅🤣
Donkey Green is TRASH
Am I the only one that thinks people are D riding Celtics??
This will be one of the most forgettable seasons in NBA history of the Celtics win. What a weak champion.
curry the reason they lost choked on 4th quarter so many turnovers trying to force fancy pass led to turnover wew
Cmon warriors Step it the f up Boston not even that good. They got lucky this year
They need to get rid of Draymond bruh get bk KD no cap 😒
5:08 god bless the camera man. what a shot of a beautiful pass.
I think lebron James need Boston for championship.
no one is talking about how bad draymond played!!
Lets give Jaylen Brown his flowers. Man set the tone for the entire team early in the game and you could see the swagger spread to everyone else.
5:40 left of screen:  down syndrome Neanderthal man!
until steve kerr will not believed on the second unit strength they ll keep losing i mea kuminga bjelica  poole payton and porterand moody they will not win the championship period!!! cury and thompson declines so much their accuracy is not acceptable on beating celtics team
G Ottawa th r o it out there Tatum  kobe posess
The Warriors are NOT A DYNASTY!!!
love seeing the Celtics win...
Warriors needs big man!!!!!
Poole was out there looking like a bath tub 🤣
As good of a shooter and player steph curry is he is a liability on the defensive end. Jordan will never ever let jalen brown score on him so easy. Whoever went against T Mac saying curry and Jordan are so diff need to apologize.
HOW MANY OPEN 3'S ARE THE WARRIORS GOING TO ALLOW THE CELTICS TO TAKE BEFORE THEY MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT?   I MEAN GODDAM
All Boston dirty player
gsw w/out durant is nothing.....
the height difference just separated the odds of who's going to win the inside game tonight
Triple single Draymond back at it again!
The Celtics really want it and i don't blame them.
Best part of the game was the karma dished on Curry. You kick out and get a flagrant 1 on a 3 pointer against horford.... then oh imagine that hustle play, loose ball, you dont get it, and magically you are hurt so bad might miss a game???? Fragile, Golden State is fragile.
Why don’t they put someone on horford 2 freaking games now…
Deeply disappointed in my Warriors.
I’m looking for a logo designer, please comment your Instagram :)
How are the Celtics able to get all those garbage rebounds at the glass and let Curry get 40 a game if the Celts close the lanes and get all the rebounds
these trading and forez ads are little bit annoying, youtube please limit their ads, thank you
Boston is gonna win
to beat GS break somebody leg
Thanks  Jason Marcus White smart sa efforts you've showed.  SALAMAT

It's crazy how the warriors were drilling threes at crucial moments and Boston still held up strong and answered back.  They did a great job on not letting Poole take over

kd be regretting leaving the warriors lol
Im not really impressed with klay’s defense tonight. What do you guys think?
The guy who keep spamming gsw in 5 be like: 👁💧👄💧 👁

Spurs fan rooting for the Celtics, lots of alumni on that team
Idk what to say because klay actually was scoring this time , the warriors gotta stop playin with this Celtics team they're to young
Curry 0 points 2 turnovers in the 4th and got cooked on defence he choked game 1 4th as well🤣
If only Draymond could score more than 1 basket smh bro is overrated at this point bc he is almost considered to b an all star when he’s literally a system player
Warrior fans thought they could win a ring without Durant 😂😂😂

Hopefully the game 4 you must carefully the initiative and communication is present always andkeep safe celtics.
This Celtics team is what the Clippers was suppose to be lmao!
9:05 Celtics in 5
Nice efforts thanks celtics that job well done  GOD bless sa team celtics. GOD bless  coaches celtics..
that's was awesome az bball play ....
Warriors are washed and Celtics are too good. I see the Celtics reigning with Milwaukee for the next 3-4 years
I wonder why Kerr benched Looney. They needed his size on the paint
Williams rebounding over the back of Greene ALL NIGHT!
Draymond Green apart from talking ru bbish, he brings nothing to his team. He can’t pass, shoot,…
NBA doesn't hit the same, the finals with KG , Ray ALLEN, PAul PIERCEEEEEE Was WAYYY more exciting to watch , they play so boring now ,,,,....
Dray is becoming useless on the floor, no scoring and no defense
I don't see any dubs here. y?
I said it b4 size n defense matters in da league curry n klay clowned I'm dis game n still lost dats problem no cap lol stay safe RIP Ray Liotta Marion Barber pray for our world BLM God bless checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
Ayo, both teams showed out. Amazing performances and a great series.  I still can't tell who is going to win it all, and that's what's awesome about it.
Good Win for the Celtics, but i think they need to work on their 3rd Quater.  Scared the shit out of the fans when the Warriors had the lead.
Boston in 6.. prediction  https://youtu.be/uDGshWjzx10
killer game! Loved it!
Boston in 6.. prediction  https://youtu.be/uDGshWjzx10
What’s these highlights don’t show you is how many whistles the Warriors got the entire Game every single time they started to gain traction.
its like wtaching LeBrons offspring grow up that he beat up on his entire carrer just sometimes his team played like dog shit around him but he never failed to dog these 2 teams every time he stepped on the court. he caannot control his team making or missing shots like they did with shumpert trash ass and delavadova head ass. LeBron is the GOAT by far
Kerr F***s up another possible Warriors victory.  Thanks you giant D***.
I wanted GS to win but Im gonna say it…Celtics in 7
I really like how this Celtics team is playing such unity and skills for this team I can see them winning it all 🙏🏾💪🏾🙏🏾💖👑🤴🏾🤴🏾🤴🏾🤴🏾🤴🏾💪🏾🏀😇 the leadership is within each player. #AllIn2022#trustGod#trueGreen Good night 💤😴 n God 😌 bless you 🙏🏾💪🏾💖 all.
what an Amazing game,  props to both teams for playing with a hunger for the chip.
That shot by Otto Porter was god awful yet it was so pure😂
2 down 2 to go..
If Celtics outscore warriors in 3rd quarters then they can win easily
I've never rooted for Boston in my life but when you play the biggest bunch of DBags in the league you gain a few fans.
See game 4 2-2 nice finals game ever
Warriors fan here - We’ve always missed having a great center on our team. I’ve been a fan since the We Believe team and we have never had a great center to play with Baron Davis, Monta Ellis or the Curry and Thompson era. Warriors have been the smaller team but you’d think they’d get some help down low. Celtics look good definitely gotta give them their props. They have a great coach if all you Celtics fans haven’t noticed.
If draymond doesn’t show up for the next couple games gsw got 0 shot
Game 4 will be pivotal for warriors
That step back by steph that was a 2  at the 8 min mark in 4th was impossibly clean
is it me or did this game look like game 63 in the regular season lmfao
Warriors in 6🤦🏽
Good work guys. Only 2 more to go.
Eat sh*t leftist prick Steve Kerr. That's all. #leftistscourge #liberalscourge
Dont worry warriors will be champion
Deuce ain’t the only son Tatum got
Celtics in 6
Sorry dub fans, My team is very heavy.
2more win . Celtics 👏 for Champion 🏆
👌🥶🔥
KD should rescue GSW on the brink of 3-1 lead by Boston🤣🤣🤣
Well guess who not going to be in my top 30 if GS get they are busted this series💀.. Not even a Bron fan but y'all can stop that shit right now too.. GS going to have to dig deep deep to see the light here and I don't see it now.. Ggs.. Also Draymond set the tempo with all that recklessness and its coming to Curry lmao..
I've been a warriors fan my entire life, but I'm also just a basketball fan in general. This is the most competitive and physical finals weve had in the last couple years. I love seeing a young Tatum really come into his own, and obviously he worked with Kobe earlier in his career, and he does kind of remind me of a young kobe. Steph is playing outstanding for the most part, besides second half of game 1. This might just go back and forth the entire series because both teams are just amazing after a loss. Also it sickens me to see fans cheering when people are injured. As a sports fan, you never want to see or with anyone to be injured, that's just weak af.
Gud luck team Celtics
Y'all must be on crack on steroids if yall think Curry and the Dubs aren't choosing which games they wanna win and lose 🤣
Kobe tatum
Golden state won’t win the chip if they can’t find a rhythm and identity. Curry can’t be the only one dropping big numbers every night they need at least three or four players to go KRAZY. They don’t have any bigs fr fr so it’s gonna hurt them . They need to adjust their defense and get more rebounds. If Klay really start Getting T’d and Andrew Wiggins as well even Jordan poole they will come out on top every time.
Disappointed in warriors. Especially Draymond, he needs to be composed and play better than this shit.
Galing idol bumalik Yung laro nung game 1
🔥 🔥
Yes sir
Jaylen Brown
Who’s the announcer in the beginning ? Celtics did not beat the lakers in the 2010 finals, sir.
8:57
Maybe if Green would get it together and the splash bros had more help they'd win easy! Come on Green get in the game!! Looked like Green was payed off not to play like we all know he can.
Imo Klay gonna be the deciding factor for GS in this series. If he starts really catching 🔥on offense and defense I think Warriors take this at the end!
You can see all the Warriors players  hard breathing especially Steph. These team are not the Mavericks who lacks defense. Warriors are tired of Celtics defense.😳😳😳
i think the warriors finish it out
The Celtics almost lost because of Smart not being smart at all. He's trying to be fancy at made a lot of turnovers.
Umay ubus 20k ko
Bandwagon Warrior fans: “Not worried Curry will dominate the next 3 games! Warriors in 6!”🤡🤡🤡
I am a gsw fan but i am getting piss of from draymond green
Warriors are too old. They had their time.
Draymond got assraped in the paint
Hell yeahhhhh Let’s fawking Goooooooooo Celtics … yes I’m a bandwagon and yes I hate the warriors and yes my team sorry asf right now because of the warriors 😂😂😂🤣
Good win for the Celtics but Marcus smart has to fight over screens and not go under
I think Celtics might win this fr
Draymond was on 🔥 tonight. Mf had 2 points he was unstoppable
I'm not worried Warriors in 7
If Boston is serious about winning this series they'll win game 4.
The splash brothers need Durant badly. The warriors will not win another game. Curry and Thompson are hands on hips exhausted in the 4th quarters of these finals games.
If you haven’t seen the movie N.B.A promote a.k.a HUSTLE, then you know who already the CHAMPS!  Celtics ‘22
Brown has so much potential…
warriors should impose their will and their strength in numbers if they want to win the championship.
Draymond Green is so trash 🗑.
Draymond Green is so trash 🗑.
Warriors are old and they really need to trade in green,wiggins and poole for either KD or giannis..do not trade for lebrum james dude is done he old too
dont understand Boston 3rd quarter issue they need a pg why not Wall if he take a buy out
God it feels great to be an NBA fan.
Jason Tatum and Luka doncic deserve to have a signature shoe
Klay is close to the 9th inning of his career.. Dray's game has resorted to mind games and Poole is inconsistent. Poor Steph... C's in 5
Celtics on the roll  Nice game.Lots of 3s and  high scoring
GSW NEEDS KD 😂😂😂
Brown for Finals MVP
Celtics reminds me of the Raptors who beat the gsw in 2019  Lowry/Gasol/Siakam/kawhi lenard  Also a complete team   Or the atlanta hawks 2013 With   Hortford/korver/teague/Milsap/Caroll
terrible defense from GS in the 3rd and 4th quarter. Really unnecessary double teams. But the team will bounce right back. Lucky win for the celtics, see you in game 4.
love this game
Critics are a different beast with Williams on the floor.
OMG green is dominated
Celtics in 6 EZ
Celtics gritty. This match up is so good!
The warriors are ass without Curry!
4:07 Draymonds gotta make a better pass than this. Or just slow the tempo down. Make better decisions with the ball fellas.
Celtics is a complete team They defeat Nets - with Durant and kyrie Bucks - defending champ Heat - no. 1 standing Warriors - for the champion
Nba finals lowlights 4:33 - 4:42
#CelticsIn6
Kyrie Sucks
What happen to you curry ay!!
Dam this was a three point shoot out for both teams 💯
CELTICS FANS! QUESTION! How did you feel in the 3rd after Curry made that 3 to take the lead?! 😂 I'm just curious
Nasaan na yung mga gsw na nag sasabi na talo na ang celtics? Anu ngayun talo naman kayo. Wag niong e under estimate yung celtics kasi kahit d naman sila ga noon ka galing pero nag lalaro sila bilang team.
Is Tatum injured right now?  He looked differently than when he was playing vs Miami
Celts in 6 been saying it these boys in goldenstate can’t handle the youth
The Warriors needs to play Wiseman!  To counter that Fucking Rob Williams!  A swollen knee would only takes one week to heal.  And It's been three months since being announced that his knee are swelling! Come on Steve Kerr let Wiseman play If you want to win this series!
There are special people and then there are those that are a special kind of special. These same 4 or 5 people that copy and paste to every comment definitely are a special kind of special. What an amazing life a person must have to have time to respond to every comment. I genuinely believe that they are just so lonely that they do it so they have someone to talk to. Everyone talks smack to them, and in their mind they probably believe that they are having conversations with their friends lmao
LETS GO CELTICS!!!! I’m tired of these bandwagon warrior fans
well i guess now we gotta put an *Asterisks* if the Celtics win because of Stephs injury -_-
That block from Brown to Thompson was amazing. Good job Celtics! GG Warriors, let's get that bucket next game. Warriors in 6 🔥
Cry cry cry now…
As a neutral fan, all I care about is that the home team finally wearing white jerseys again. Plus "The finals" printed on the court brings back a lot of memories.
Congratulations Boston tapos nyo po ang laban para malaman ng gsw hindi pastaran ang laban kundi team go go go go Celtics team fight fight fight ❤❤❤
Go Celtics !!! 💪
I’m getting tired of watching Curry just looking for open threes whether he’s down or up on the score, it’s not as fun to watch, or as smart to play. Celtics are displaying a formidable prowess defensively, and it’s what professional basketball is meant to be! Fingers crossed, job ain’t done till it’s over.
Time to give Smart his props as an offensive force... and recognize Jaylen & Jayson as batman and superman.  No Robin.   I enjoy watching these games.  Sports shows are toxic.
I don’t think this was a very lopsided game til the 4th if any other warriors other than curry would’ve caught some type of heat the game would’ve been closer good game great series as a sports fan I love it
If celtics win. Jaylen brown is gonna win finals mvp
Celtics defense is real
Wiggins is underutilized.  They should’ve designed more plays for him.  He got his points early and they just fazed him out till 4th qrt
If the boston win in 5 this playoff would be same as 2017 finals where the Cavs dominate the boston  won in 5 (eastern finals). While the GSW  was forced by Prime harden in 7 (western finals), But they took down the Cavs in 5. Imma right?
Steph has been trash in the fourth this series (6pts). Idc how many points he’s avg, the man is MIA when it matters. Then he had 3 consecutive turnovers to start the fourth. I had the warriors winning this but I’ve seen enough in 3 games. You’re not winning a championship scoring 13 and 11 pts in the 4th…JB for fmvp
Boston stand up
Why everyone on the Celtics so ugly?
Please Boston beat this pathetic golden state team so I can see Stephanie Curry cry like a baby!!!
the team off gsw is weak and not good defense
Reminds me of the WWF. That's entertainment.
Celtics can explode from more positions. If you shut down 1 2 more can take over.
Boston is good team
Celtics in 5 💪
Excuses for GSW in case they lost the finals: 1. Klay, Iggy and GP2 isn't 100% 2. JP is young 3. Draymond is not the same 4. Mistakes from coaching stuff  Pls add some if there are more lol
Golen State Warriors with no D lol 😂
You can see on al horford he really want this championship
JB for MVP
Lookin like Celtics in 6 now I don’t see GSW winning in Boston
celtics havae a chance to win a championship,as long as brown,tatum,horford,williams III and white is healthy!
Jaylen brown really had the bounce back game that was needed to win tonight. Celtics in 6
Witnessed game 3 live let’s go C’s !!!!!
Banner number 18 coming up! Let’s go celtics! 🍀🍀
Rooting for Celtics, because of arrogance of gsw players and fans! They’re shooting 3 and most of the players thought they already won the championship while Boston Celtics won 3rd game they did not even flinch🤷🏽
Warriors are to small that’s what is hurting them
Gsw can't win in bosston
Let’s go 🔥🇩🇴🇩🇴
Why is that freakin’ Somalian Pirate waving a foreign flag on the ship that is of my country at 1:58? Are we just going to stand by and let them hijack us? I think not. God Bless America 🇺🇸 Seriously, I am really sick and tired of those people disrespecting our country and our flag, waving their foreign flags in our faces, as if our country that God blessed them with everything isn’t the one they are supposed to pledge their allegiance to. How random is it to see them waving their flags at American sporting events now. Just wow. Good LORD in Heaven help us guide our ship.
I said it since game one Celtics in 5 🤣😁
Celtics seem more well balanced then GS, gone are the days of the strong and dominant big man on the inside, think Shaq may have been one of the last overall, seems like most NBA teams just use guards and forwards, the point guard position doesn't seem as important, Chris Paul is still probably one of the best, but his clock is ticking, probably, ( if he can stay healthy) good for another year or two, he deserves a ring for the kind of career he's had, I think
Celtics are hungry. Their defense is on another level. They have so many options on offense that they overwhelmed the hell outta GSW. The way they’re playing, I can see them winning the chip this year.
I want the celtics to get there 17th nba  championship🏆
Celtics raking the series at this point idc what the next person gotta say jt want it bad
What happened to the " Warriors in 5 " basic takes? Any real basketball fan knew it wasn't gonna be that cut and dry. (I got receipts even at the start of the play offs saying Celtics would have a good shot at winning) Also shout outs to Jimmy higher roller for predicting they were the sleeper threat to win it all.
Klay you better activate that inner mamba like back in Chicago when you did it 14 times.
yeah warriors not taking the chip this year sadly
It's all about the money it will be 3-4 warriors victory.
Celtics are very young team yet very experienced in the playoffs at the same time!
If JB keeps playing like this he’ll definitely win finals MVP
Golden state only scored 6 points in the last 8 minutes 😭
Golden State Warriors must change their coach. GSW lost because of poor coaching.
Celtics  are younger , bigger , and deeper then GS! Then on top of that they play Great defense. GS has all the experience and they play good small ball defense! Klay is way too inconsistent and Poole can’t score on Boston like he has been all year and playoffs up till this point ! Steph never stops moving and can’t hold up for 4 quarters anymore like he use too, he’s 34 and gasped! The run is over for GS, Celtics in 5
Here lemme fix that title.   "WARRIORS @ REFS."  Cmon if you watched that game, you'd agree. I'm non biased and it was pretty blatant at some points. GS wasn't hitting and they lost alotta momentum cuz of fouls. Curry got in foul trouble early and still balled out. They woulda never gone down by that much and wouldn't have to waste so much energy trying to come back DOWN 18 plus the calls. By the 4th they were drained and Dray being fouled crushed their defense and Boston took advantage.  I won't take away from the Celtics defense either,  #1 defense for a reason. Klay was good til he lost his rhythm and Poole was non existent.  JB's performance tho. He finals mvp if they win tbh. Bruh the game was over and Boston almost folded. What a hell of a stat line tho, the less experienced came out to ball. Game 4 gone be crazy. 🤯
What a Play😭🔥  I can't predict whos gonna win, Im Gsw fan but boston is unbelievable🔥
Let’s Go Celtics
Green can’t even guard Brown and he also have terrible offense. He is useless in this series
Draymund with his triple mouth and 2 points.
the Celtics are a better team
Boston beating the Warriors in game 3 awesome, Draymond fouling out with only 2 points? Priceless 🙂 oh and the f u Draymond chant when he got ejected? Even more priceless 🤣 what a douche bag
Let's Go Celtics.
What a D
Boston were able to beat Nets, Bucks and Heat. GSW is just too easy for them. GSW wins through luck, from 3 points shootout, w/c is not gonna happen every game for them, they're small and bullied in the paint.. There is no way they can win again since KD left.. But credits to GSW for being great team..
Nice boston..coming up for championship
boston
I’ve been saying Brown is better than Tatum. Tatum only scores more because he puts up a lot more shots.
I could only imagine with a good mindset Kyrie Iriving if he had never left how unstoppable this team would be ! Unreal
gs need james wiseman
Warriors will led Boston take 3-1 lead so they can comeback and reverse win in Game 7 and erase their 2016 Finals memory.
JUST IMAGINE BEING AL HORFORD IF THE CELTICS WIN THE SHIP
Warriors in 7 🚶🏽‍♂️
Draymond got more fouls than points 😂😂
still goin 7...bahston
As a Celtics fan of over 35+ years, I was still uncomfortable with even double digit lead because Warriors are that good.
Where you at Draymond ? Stop doing all that talk show shit & play the game ! They need you
Klay looking weak In this one🤦🏾‍♂️
IME UDOKA
Up yours haters.
76ers be like: We trust their (Celtics) process.
This the offense they need smart, brown,Tatum, hoford,Williams and I bet they win it all
F the warriors F draymond green he a b**** fr 😂😂😂 I hope Boston pulls thru with curry down I don't see this going 7. Dawgs JB and JT and smart definitely deserve this more  they more physical GS and bunch of crybabies on God 💯
Dràmot Green he knows that he will won't push the Celtics buttons these guys are so smart and well Couch that it's there time and we will just celebrate one game at a time Go Celtics yea har underlay
Welcome Back Mike Breen the voice of the NBA finals
Green 2pts and tons of fouls. Keep him out of the game.
i like boston but i want to see curry get a a trophy finals mvp before he retrired
Celtics will win series can feel it
Crying Curry😭
Celtics play with some much hustle and effort. The warriors seem to get way to frustrated and give up on plays.
boston have a great bigman
Warriors got stomped again like I knew they would by the celtics who got it done at home. Great win. Made the warriors look like high school kids. The warriors can't win without jacking up 100 threes. The warriors are nothing without the 3 point shot which is sad and takes no skill to hit threes. 75 % of the league are 40 % or higher from 3 nowadays. Defense wins championships. Goldenstate doesn't have lock down individual or team defense. Draymond and Wiggins and curry are all getting bullied by size.
Draymond with 2 pts and Poole with 10 pts not going to get it done for the Warriors.
wow
Old Legs VS Young Legs.  I'll take young legs (Boston).  It is always fun to root against Draymond Green, the dirtiest NBA player.
I had the Celtics in 5
Kerr got to make the in game adjustment... he failed to do so in the 4th quarter of game 1 and 3. Today, Green was useless in the offense and Bos knew he was not going to shoot and all they did was using the extra man to chase Curry and Klay instead... Kerr should have benched Green in the 4th and called some plays for Poole and Wiggins to show different angles to free up the splash brothers rather than keep throwing 3s and hope it's 3rd quarter again...
I repeat, this is not a game for lil niggas, Curry not built for this🤡
I can't believe GSW only scored 11 points in the whole 4th quarter, that's insane Mind blown. Go Celtics!
Bulok na gsw
Celts in 5☘️
They weathered two major warrior storms Game 1 and this game. If it comes down to a game 7 they might actually ice it up.
Go Bean town !
*GREAT JOB CELTICS!!!!*  *DESTROY GOLDEN STATE!!!!*
Great game but the refs are cheating the warriors. Steph didnt even foul but the refs said he did foul. And also Horford tried injuring Steph earlier in like 3rd quarter. Man this so unfair. Then the next game, they will make the hoop shorter so gsw will miss again
Pls watch the WNBA to promote equality, diversity and social justice.
O
Jayson Tatum with all the crazy drives and lay-ups.. LETS GO CELTICS! 2 MORE!
JT and JB on a historic playoff run but mans still wont give em props
I don't see anyone talking about how the Warriors were that close to beating a Celtics team firing on ALL CYLINDERS with only Steph and Klay really showing up, the others didn't play horribly, but the Warriors need Poole to shine when it's a night like this, otherwise they lose by 16, now to be fair I don't see Smart giving you 20 points each game, and I don't see Williams getting 10 rebounds each game, nor do I see JT AND JB both going off each game, so I still say Warriors in 7, but DAMN DO WE GOT A SERIES BABY!!!! This is shaping up to be the best finals we've seen in a while IMHO whoever wins I'm okay with it, the Warriors are my favorite team right now to watch, and Curry has earned the W at this point, but Boston is my home team, and they're dominant this year, so I'm more than okay with them winning lol, but I just think they're not there just yet, I think this is the year they lose IN the finals, to come back Hungry as hell next year after having that taste!
Celtics are straight beasts ! Is like running to a wall when you face against a defensive team like the C’s. Celtics in 6
NBA has a serious problem with the officiating and the phantom foul calls on shooting fouls. 75% of the time minimum, there is NO contact. The Curry foul to give him a 4 point play with the foul shot was CLEARLY no contact. He fell into Horfort and then collapsed on the ground like a soccer player. Just horrible. The refs aren’t favouring any team….they are just making phantom calls. It’s really bad
Celtics are bigger, more athletic, younger, hungrier, and deeper on and off the bench. Celts series to win or lose. They go up 3-1 Friday.
I’m a huge gsw and curry fan but the Celtics just brought it tonight the amount of off reb was insane although they do have major height advantage still impressive also there defense was just to much for them. Warriors winning next one tho
Warriors can’t get rebounds and can’t shoot basic jumpers, much less 3s, so how are they possibly going to win
Boston seriously, the turnovers!
dubs really need a big man
NOOOOOOOOOOO WARRIORS NEEDED TO WINNNN
Mike Breen 🤝🏿 The Finals
Let's go Boston Celtics!🎶🎸🏀😄👍
All the players in Boston contributing. Lets Go!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Curry is not 4th quarter clutch plain and simple
Can’t believe Draymond swore in his postgame I have been in a fetal position shaking for hours. Truly disturbing behavior
They need to get rid of the 3, it’s destroying the game. It’s not fun seeing teams take 50% of their shots from the 3.
thE MIAMI Heat can Beat Boston.I hope NBA will give the Righ Infredients of Player for them.their Undersize unmanned but still manage to force game 7.. id butler 3 goes in.Heat might be Champ this year
Good Job Jason Tatum
Warriors in 6
The Celtics are putting the world on notice….2 wins away from greatness.
Boston cut down their turnovers this series wouldn’t even be close...Boston is the better team...G.S has the better player in curry but after that that squad is iffy klay ain’t the same he’s mad inconsistent...Boston needs 2 more let’s go ☘️☘️☘️
LBJ is the Goat
Jalen brown moves similar to michael jordan
Who else got that badass still of that guy dunking before an ad
This game is over... Celtics will be the champs
I hope the world recognizes that J. Brown is the Celtics best player of they give him the keys they will be better off he is one you can't contain. Until J. Tatum get that hitch out of that 3 mechanism shot I mean he does three hitches before the release that is why he gets contained more than brown.
The golden state warriors are putting on a show this year…acting like they can’t beat the Celtics🧐🧐 if the NBA wanna give it to TATUM for KOBE jiss say that 😣 but don’t act like the Celtics are so MASSIVE 🙃curry playing like shit for all reasons 😋
Draymond green is ass. 34 mins 1/4 with 2 pts. Great defender. But trash asf on offense 😂😂
Celtics too big for that team. all warriors can do is shoot outside shots. no easy Alley Oops. draymond ain't Catching Alleys or looney
Well done Celtics on the win.Congratulations! Just need two more win for the Gold.
Dapat kase ibabad Ng dubs SI looney. Ang liliit nila. At na dominate Ng Celtics Ang mga to.
Golden state will win the next game. Looks like the nba wants a 7 game series. $$$
Celts win Game 1 GSW win Game 2 Celts win Game 3 GSW win Game 4 Celts win Game 5 GSW win Game 6 GSW win Game 7
Lets Go Navarro
Take off the FREAKING ADS.!!!!!! FCKKKKK
Only in Boston they gonna allow ex players on the court during actual game action a la Pierce...Go Celtics!!
Game 3 win will be the last for Boston. Warriors gonna win the next 3 games, mark my words. WARRIORS IN 6
2-1 and Boston fans already talking about how GS Doesn't have an answer for their team.  Like the answer they got in game 2??? Lol!  Too early for that sh!t. We will take game 4 and then take this back home for win #3. Don't get me wrong..... this is going 7 games. I'm not a little fan boy yappin at the mouth. This is tough series for both. Toughest series for GS thats for sure. But saying GS doesn't have an answer. That's flat out stupid. Boston fan boys need to stop commenting.
6:02 how is that a foul???
Draymond get the blame today ...his well praised defense is not here tonight...and no rebounds
Warriors own the 3rd quarters,  Celtics own the 4th quarters , except game 2
Last Time Golden State Won The Finals was When Durant was Around.
We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory sin is terrible because of sin we are separated from God but gladly here is the good news Jesus Christ came and walked this earth for everyone taught us the perfect way to live and how we should live and he died for our sins because we need a sacrifice to pay the price for our sins since our sins deserve hell if we live in sin but also more good news Jesus rose from the dead three days later we have to leave the sin behind and put it away and live new with Jesus this world is like a vapor it passes away but your eternity is forever and it is up to you what you want to do with it……
Lets GO BOSTON! #TurnUp
Klay didn't do anything in that Last Quarter
ok 1st off, Horfords in bound pass cross court to jaylon was play of the game , that man should be a nfl quarterback, dropped it in beautifully, and unlike my squads qb eagles hertz at 5'10",  horford can see over the line. sign him and Foles up asap. though tatem was hurt at first. jus saw highlights missed the game, but it seems like theres some real coaching battles happening, both teams gad good defensive strategies, jus celtics had better plans b. and c plans. but some1 please tell celtics coach, the mask is supposed to be used while u talk and yell, or its defeating the purpose, so many people just doing whsts politically correct .
What’s the excuse warriors fans lol 😂
I HATE WHEN TEAMS BLAME THE REFS FOR A LOST. IM A WARRIORS FAN REFS BEEN HORRIBLE ALL SEASON AND POSTSEASON FOR EVERYONE U STILL HAVE TO PLAY. WE LOST TONIGHT BECAUSE DRAYMOND LITERALLY DID NOTHING TONIGHT, POOLE HAS TO STOP WITH ALL THE FANCY DRIBBLING, TURNOVERS, DEFENSE WAS DOG SHIT FROM THE START OF THE GAME, AND NOT REBOUNDING. STEVE KERR NEED TO STOP TAKING STEPH OUT WHEN HE’S HOT.
Warriors are done once Celtics win game 4 This is not the same warriors back then.. Boston might win this. And I know warrior bandwagon fans will find a way for excuses and blame Kerr 😂aslways. And even assume horford is Trying to injure curry 😂 I love the way warrior fans think defending and ride on curry's dik
I've said time and again, whoever won the Heat vs Celtics series will win the NBA championship this year. The team that challenged the C's this playoffs is the Heat. The C's barely escaped that series with one shot from Jimmy Butler. I can see now that this series will not go to game 7, this will be a quick series for the C's. I'm not a C's fan but it's pretty obvious that the C's are dispatching this weak Warriors team in 5 or 6 games (the most), no way this series goes to game 7. The Warriors are weak, small, and barely plays defense, they live by the three and die by the three, tonight they died by the three. I always compared this Warriors as the Brooklyn Nets in steroids. The Heat would have beaten this Warriors team too btw. Draymond and all his antics aint gonna rattle these C's coz they've been tested by two juggernauts in the east (Heat and Bucks). Among the teams the C's faced this playoffs, the Heat was the best they played against, this series will be a cake walk for these Celtics.
Guyz , pay attention, this iz fixed just like tha rest of sports ,NBA wants 💰, so game 7 gonna happen😂, tit 4 tat iz how this series will go , but i think golden state goes away with the 🏆 🤔💯
CURRY NG INA NYO
F Boston forever, Massachusetts and the team🖕🏿
@4:30 what was the point of this
what a happy day 2-1
Sheesh great game. Damn we down 2-1. Hope we can still win 3 games.
Dang! The warriors lost again due to poor performance on the 4th. kept on shooting 3 when they should have made a sure 2. and TO, bad passes, bad handling, and bad decisions on 4th. still calling it warriors in 6. congrats to the celtics.
Well done Celtics
Just realized that the warriors are all about 3’s. If you try and limit them with that, I’m sure Celtics would have no problem. Celtics just doesn’t settle for 3’s. Great start. Very aggressive.
*”Jayson Tatum the goat”  🐐 - MELL DUNEY 616*
FUCK THE CELTICS
Put Kevin harlan in finals comentator
Celtics came out to play and warriors were late to respond
Boston keep playing like this they gonna get a 💍
Warriors can shoot but they have no defense. Celtics have both. Great win C's
Brown block was fucking crazy Celtics deserve to win this series
Ppl gotta stop acting like the majority of the celtics roster isn’t 6’8” 💀
the warriors need a real center
Jt keeps going right every time at the basket. If I can figure this out , why can't the warriors?
Celtics out here bullying gaymon... just attack curry late in games is how ya beat the warriors.  Dude is an absolute liability defensively.
What this Celtics team has done i've noticed throughout their tenure this season, they feed off of each teams energy keeping defense true to their core, but offensively they remind me of a Picasso quote "good artists borrow, great artists steal.” when things go right their offense draws off of and mimics each and every team they face, just about every starting player has been up to that challenge at different times. Lets fucking go C's and get this 18th banner.
2 wins away
I know my Memphis Grizzlies are better than both Boston and Golden State. Tough watching these NBA Finals knowing my Memphis Grizzlies should be in the Finals. # Next Year #
This series has made me not like the warriors. They are a bunch of flopping crybaby’s that usually get all the dumb calls
Great game by the C's. They had a strong start and did good to weather that 3rd quarter run by the Warriors. But they're gonna have to be ready in Game 4 though because Golden State is gonna punch back and punch back hard.
Lets just finish the series.
Sa hindi pa sila nagkatagpo sa finals alam kong kinakabahan ako kasi tinutulungan ng referees ang celtics sa playoffs... Kaya umaabot ng gm7 bawat series nila eh.... Defense my foot! Taena foul trouble starters ng warriors...
Let’s go Boston Curry sucks !!!!!!!!
Go go Celtics
KD to boston next season.
Go Celtics go go dbaling matalo Basta mayaban lang.
Draymond is a softy, can't play defense these days, to old, all he can do now is piss people off
Celtics coming different this year, they are really composed for a young team
Bro horford a fkn beast !
Tamsak
AM NOT A CELTICS, FAN BY I WANT TO WIN THIS SERIES!
Warriors need Lebron
And they said warriors in 5 hahaha probably not 🤣🤣
The Boston celtics are on the mission this year 🔥 🙌
after sixers got harden. celtics playrd the sixers and beat us by 50. i saw something and said im betting on them to win the trophy, i only bet 100, im sick to my stomach
I live in San Francisco and the whole city is quiet LMAO
Y'all just wait 'til game 4. Klay found rhythm, Steph is pissed off, Wiggins is attacking effectively, and the defense is going to capitalize on the sloppiness of those posing leprechauns
Man wtf Klay Steph , I just just lost 800
My prediction is that whoever wins 4 games in this series, will become the champions
Great W for the Celtics they out defended my favorite team but I'm not disappointed with our loss we can still win the series Warriors in 7!!
😭😭😭
Lesssss goooooo celitics cracked out of their mind
All these bandwagon warrior fans were so cocky saying golden state in 5 😅
This series going to 7 games . Boston winning Friday, going up 3-1 . That's when things get serious. Same thing like in 2016 . It's more money , more games and more ratings. You think Adam silver letting this big money series with two good teams finish in 5/6?? Two historic teams ? 💰? Lol think about it
Where the trash 🗑 warriors fans at? 🤣 warriors are not beating the Celtics curry bout to get spanked again by another all around team the like raptors did to golden state
Told you that the Celtics got this fam
JB FMVP
GSW in 6
Won’t be this way next game
Choke curry again
Easy wun by Celtics
Big win by the Boston celtics 🙌 💪 😎
Triple single 🥰
Respect for both team 👏🏼
A definitely a good win 🏆 👏 on the. Part of the Celtics all around game especially and particularly when spacing the floor and. Getting good open shots as we'll I'm definitely smelling champagne 🍾 go Celtics go 🚶‍♀️
Los guerreros cayeron en problemas.
Playing like a true family.
Geez this was a good game.
I'm gonna try to bet on our local Lottery here in the Philippines. 3D(3 digit) Lotto. I'll pick 2-4-3 ,hope I win some.
If warriors lose this series curry aint clutch at all..and I'm say KD carry warriors too those TWO championships. Curry would have 1 ring without kd🤔.
Come on Warriors!!!
We Believe 💙💛💙💛 see y’all at the parade in the bay #WarriorsBasketball
Warriors still in 6...
KUDOS to Celtics' 6th man of the year and MVP SCOTT FOSTER!
If warriors win in 4, this is no doubt rigged lol u fans
If boston win game 4 on sat. Game 5 win also boston bcoz the momentum is on boston and tatum brown smart horford excited and confident to get a ring
Where's Larry?
"Smart, corner three, BANG"💥☘ Celtics in 6🏆 8:50
GSW gonna get washed game 4. Celtics too good. Only Miami could have beaten them.... >_>
If I had a dollar for every time Wiggins missed an open shot, I’d be rich.
If the opponent is almost as talented as your team in offense, and they have a bigger line up, small ball wont stand a chance. Size still matters in the modern day nba.
I can’t believe I’m Cheering for BOS!!!
Boston: they are who we thought they were and we didn’t let them off the hook!!
Warriors in 8 🤣
Two wins away from a title
warriors defense was absolute trash this game
Boston 2022 NBa Champion
THAT GREEN LAYUP💀💀💀😂
When are we going to do something,  feeling entitled !!
Asa naman kadtong gaingon nga swerte ra kaayo if makaisa ang Boston. Nakaduha na gani...
if boston pkayed liked this and take their great defese they will win again in game 4 and game 5 lets fo it again❤️💪
one team playing like light skins and the other playing like dark skins story of this series
Wiggins should step up poor shooting
NBA is rigged , it’s gonna be  a game seven this year! Come back and give me likes 👍
if the warriors lose again in game 4. its over. again its over
Really hoping the C's can pull this series out and finish gs.... Sick of the warriors
Wow. What a game Boston. I’m a lakers fan. But i do hope you guys win. You have worked really hard for it.
Celtics proving they not getting beat 2 times in a row.
Tatum vs Wiggins will be the next rivals
Celtics would be up 3-0 if not for refs in game 2. Warriors can't beat teams when they are healthy. Warriors are fake dynasty with injury titles. Curry can't carry teams.
if the warriors win in game 4, the game 5-6 will over, that's my predicton.. ik know steph will gonna step up in game 4, Good luck warriors
Where's all them Warrior fans talking trash after that one win. Called Boston in 6 before the series & I'm all over sports channels to back it up. Defense wins championships
Wow
2 wins away from d title,,,that would not happen...
GREEN nawawala sa focus nakuku na ang bola natatapon pa...congrats winner.
@1:38 Two carries and a double dribble in one possession by Steph…why even have refs??
I am a bit scared that GS is down two and have lost "homefield advantage." But the future is not yet completely written. Come on, #GoldenState !!!
As an old fart who hasn't watch the NBA in many years all these 3 points shots are just incredible ,. I just seen the highlights but it looks like all 5 starters can hit 3s
Lonzo ball could never be like tatum lmaoo
Man Draymond’s comments after game 1 aren’t aging well…
Celtics should close it out on Game 5. Game 6 Klay is dangerous
Man if Tatum/Brown have curry defended them they should get the ball every possession
Dirty Celtics.
Brown fmvp 💪🏽
I told u Warriors fans, come on back here, we got something for u. Robert Williams unsung hero. U better get on him, or this is gonna end in 5. Hang ur hat on Steph( much respect to him) and Green causing trouble( no respect, trouble maker on losing end.) Thats a losing formula. Keep doing it and Celtics will raise No. 18. GS still has 2 more to win here , the greatest sports town on the planet. STEPH CURRY, AS GREAT AS HE IS CAN NOT CARRY GS. NOT AGAINST THIS TEAM.
Three favorite plays of the game: 1. The in and out passing to Horford for the easy dunk, 2. Grant Williams off. rebound and going up strong amidst 3 GSW players, 3. All of R. WIlliams blocks
Celtics
The celtecs is very good player
Rob williams should be an allstar candidate next season.
Finally. A finals where I don’t know who is gonna win. Hasn’t been like this for years. And its entertaining!
Draymond can't defend R. Williams 🤣🤣
4th quarter defence is Bostons Secret.
the major factor in this win was the big difference on the rebounds, the celtics are using their height advantage eventhough curry, thompson and wiggins had a great game those rebounds kept the warriors at bay.
Celtics in 6
2 wins already plus they hijacked home court?!! Celtics in 6!!
Back to back to back blow out games.
Celtics size and sold D is the major factor for game 3 win
Draymond Green has 15 fouls and 15 points this series..ouch
The game plan is simple go at S. Curry, he’s a defensive liability, go at em. lol all he gone do is swipe at the ball. Send brown a draymond, get him a tech lol. Celtics in 6.
Finals MVP Jason Tatum PERIOD
“Tatum kicks it out, corner 3…. BANG!” Can’t tell you how much I’ve missed that
Rob Williams is extra aggressive tonight and I'm loving it! His presence is so huge on both ends. Best game so far!
Celtics are their own worst enemy. I say that because when they don’t make silly mistakes there’s honestly not a team in the league that’s on their level
It's a bit scary when the Splash Brothers both play great and they still lose. Draymond looked exhausted. Celtics may have locked it up!
warriors in what? haha
Good defense ,the credit goes to all player's. ONLY 2 wins for the NBA championship  BEST WISHES
makes me believe that the GSW would have a hard time with the 96 bulls suffocating defense..
Gsw fans announcers media is so OVER ACTING When it comes to curry they say horford intentionally hurt curry what the fuckkkkk!???? It's a rumble when it comes to ball. Fucking shit all media and announcers bias! Stop baby sitting curry potter.
Boston executes well, rebounds and they were more athletic
Let's goooo Celtics ❤️
All playing out like I said so far
Golden State WARRIORS 100 vs 116 Boston CELTICS
Warriors got DESTROYED in the paint
There will be a game 7
I appreciate greatness of Steph in this game 3
Bandwagon warriors fans 🤫🤫🤫🤫everyone saying warriors in 6 lol
i swear sometimes tatum plays like he has skill boost and sometimes he plays like his skill boost ran out.
Fuck Boston and all it’s teams.
It seems like al horford was trying to hurt curry with the tech and the time he just fell on curry
James wiseman would have come in handy this series.....
I want every fan of every team to root for the Celtics. DRAYMOND WANTS TO RUN HIS MOUTH SAYING NO ONE CAN BEAT THEM WHOLE. I’m praying Tatum drop 50 on these hoes.
Bean town let’s go.
Keep elevating to the rim Tatum! Don't draws the fouls they will come to you.
8:11
My takeaway im this game is this : Warriors have a lot of scorers plus one or two defender(s) But Celtics had a lot of all-around players who can not only score,but guard,rebound,playmake,hustle and overall the desire to win coz this squad never wins a title which made them seems more hungrier
YES! F the warriors!
No pg wasting time with dribbles and balls hugs just pure bucket getters!
as barkley said, rebounding is the most important thing
Rw 3 is playing like a poor man's Bill Russell so hopefully he can keep this up ....gm 4 could decide the series
S.Kerr is clueless. Draymond Green is a bum on both sides of the court, he's a useless mf with a big mouth, how can this guy plays so much ?! So does J.Poole, big mouth in regular season, completely disappeared in Playoffs little by little
Good game but the refs kept the game close for the Warriors. Celtics had multiple no calls.  Warriors fans here, but Celtics want it more.
Draymond Green is being eaten alive by Robert Williams. They need to put Kevon in when Robin is in. Small ball is kinda hard to do in this lineup considering JT is 6'10
Robert Williams and Green are the reason why the Dubs lost period…
These no d shooting contests are hard to watch
Warriors have no center looney is alright
Wowwwww nice game
Congrats Celtics yeahhh baby!! 😁👍🔥
Draymond is trash cannot score relay so much on his overrated defense
The donkey green got murderd tonight by the whole Celtics
Ain't no way the Warriors can lose this series man smh gotta be better defensively and Steph has to dominate
HA HA HA Celtics in 5
Celtics in 6
Tatum loosening up. Go Boston.
Tatum finally Showed up tonight, perfect timing with only 2 more for the chip 🍀🍀🍀
Gratz celtics NBA Finals Champion
WARRIORS 📣📣📣let's get this🏆. You can handle Celtics, look at how you played at 3rd, TO made you lost at 4th.
Blessings Jamaica
fuck the warriors
Curry maybe a great shooter? But his D stinks. He is not an all around player. Celtics can beat this overrated team. Defense Wins Championships. And that’s East Coast Basketball. Celtics in 6 and that’s now how it’s going down. Celtics confidence is up. Say Bye Bye to the west coast team.
A well coached Celtics team. GS has so many moving screens...my goodness
What a finals this is man
I’ll say it… I miss hightop Jaylen Brown
CELTS IN 5
Celtics have shown to be the better defensive team overall and that's helped them win games down the stretch in key moments. Conversely, the Warriors can't stop Tatum and Brown on defense. Plus Smart, Grant Williams, and others have stepped up at crucial times. Boston will win the championship because of their total team effort on both ends of the floor.
Beautiful game for us Celtics fans 😎
what a game… terrific even for gsw inspite the loss.. the downside was the reserves in the final minutes who did nothing but shoot into the air😀😀😀
The warriors, need more practice!!!!!! Or i will call them golden state Losers!!!!!!
boston's ball movement was so good
Celtics suck
Bobo gsw HHAA
Such a fun TEAM to watch
But but but Klay Thompson is a great defender. 😂
It’s over if golden state doesn’t win next game.
James Harden couldn’t do what Jaylen Brown is doing, who’s the real beard?
Scott Foster is on 🔥🔥🔥.
Lol the gs will win the next 3 games,Klay is back. It will be blowouts the next 3 games.
pag bida talo talaga sa umpisa.. #waaaarriorrrssss winstreak game 4, 5 at 6.. 🏀🏀😎💪☝️
I really didnt expect the Warriors to be down 2-1. All this talk about if Steph wins his 4th and finals MVP might have been premature. He's getting killed on the def end. Too small
If Robert Williams continue to play like this it’s over, the Celtics size is too overwhelming for the warriors
Warriors have to  make a push if they  want to win
well putting Green on jaylen brown worked for 1 game.
One word: REBOUNDS. Oh and Robert Williams. That’s it
#STEPH CURRY,THE REAL MVP & GOAT💪👊💪
Boston and their 3rd quarter blues.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! "Boston two wins from a title" C'mon now this series gonna take 7 to declare a Champion 🏆.
FSK
Curry doing his best Lebron impersonation. He might need a back surgery after this series.
Celtics flipped the script on the turnovers. Smart had the same amount of turnovers as game 2 but the playmaking as a whole looked more decisive. This time they made the Warriors pay for their high turnovers. They also fought harder on the offensive boards which gave them more chances to work more possessions. Brown looks like he played better being defended by Green this time around. Role players stepped it up but thankfully Tatum's play making found his guys on open shots.
Warrior fans "we win in 5 games"
They was going straight at curry 😂
This is the first time I'm watching a basketball match, my friends play it so I decided to watch, but man Steph Curry what a player, he gave a fight man.
Draymond really is washed. Focused to much on his podcast instead of his ACTUAL job. Dude was never in good shape. He’s digressing so fast in front of our eyes.
Golden State look gassed after that comeback.
Pack your bags warriors fans, this is Bostons time.....it's over!
Lionel here in central California. This is a rare moment in my life, to have my 2 favorite teams in the finals. But I bleed Celtic Green first. Great series.
Taking out Steph ankle.  Classy big al********(*
Fuck the Celtics
Gsw need a legit center😓
Hey, Gsw fans: 🤫
Steve Kerr, why aren't you putting in Looney when Williams is in the game?  What an idiot.  Continue giving Celtics 2nd chance shots.  How many 2nd chance shots did they get?  It is the offensive rebounds that's killing the Warriors.
How many blocks did Robert Williams have, 28 or something?
Warriors will bounce bac an  take game 4
Warriors in 7 🤷🏿‍♂️idc every time I see warriors lose in this series it’s literally them beating themselves . Too many turnovers and too much double teaming got them losing fr.
Yea man, like i said b4 celtics in 6. Also, whoever beat Giannis will win it all which is the celts
Basketball is the worst sport to watch highlights of
Even though I think the ref gave some advantage to the Celtics, but somebody from the warriors other than Curry gotta step up. There are so many mistakes down the stretch like rebounding, missed layup and nobody is making big play to force Boston to adjust. On the other end they are able to go at Curry on every procession
i thought klay won't play
Them Celtics are not to be played with
Congrats boston
The foul call on Horford on the Curry 3pt and No foul call on GP2 on the Smart 3pt. Shows the bias towards players like Steph.
Draymon green weakest link fo GSW.
I'm rooting for the Warriors but in this game, Celtics is smooth like butter and the Warriors are clunky. Well deserved win by Boston.
Boston baby! It was the Arriors tonight, no W for them 😅😅😅😝
What a game; let’s go Celtics bring it to the east
GSW CHOKED, IF BOSTON TAKES GAME 4. THEN IT WILL BE EARLY OVER FOR GSW🤩...
GSW got BULLIED on the boards…Boston was wayy more active
Raining 3s in both sides.   Sick accuracy!
Patawa tawa lng si curry kc alam nya na kaya Nila Ang boston.ha.ha.ha.paasa warriors.
The greatest weapon of Warriors is Curry and he is also the weakest link.  Celtics just demolished curry by switch and letting them Curry guard them Tatum, Smart, and Brown.   Yah you can shoot but you can't guard.
Rob Williams schooled draymond. And that's the best thing to watch
Celtics might win the chip. They needed this game.
9:02 get that s*** outta here Klay!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Warriors need to strengthen inner defense ,and hide curry on defensive end, they adjust the two warriors winning this series
Its nice to hear lasagna but tell jordan, im fasting tonight
Feels Good ❤️😊
ahahhhhh HAHAHAHAHAH injured curry 😆
Dope Ass Game... Let's gooooo💚☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Celtics defense  al horford gave some space to  Steph curry in 3 rd quarter and he erupted. Celtics defense and offense is phenomenal in 4 th quarter.
It’s so nice when we protect the ball and don’t turn it over 🍀💚🍀
The Celtics are such a unique team. No true point guard facilitating but they can just get buckets
Timelord going to win a DPOY soon. Best defensive center in basketball
I think the Warriors will win the next game with the help of the referees to make it 2-2, then the series become the best of 3, it will end in 6 or 7 games, and the NBA (referees) won't interfere anymore after the 2-2 ties.  More games more money for the NBA so this thing will go at least 6 games.
Congratulations Boston Celtics! Great team win, i am so impress with the way the defence picked up tonight. Let's go!
AL hordord kinda desperate, huh? Tried to injure Steph 2 times.
If warriors not Winning road game it's Celtics in 6
I didnt watch the game, but Draymond green only put up those numbers?
Father time catching up GSW core players
What did I told y'all Boston in 5 or 6.  Warriors weak ASF jump shooting team LMAO 🤣.
It seems as if GS struggles in the finals against teams that are not Cleveland
If you a Celtics fan I know you guys are smiling whenever Green has the ball In his hand 😂😂 don't lie.
Babawi
ROB WILLIAMS GETTIN THE LOVE HE ALWAYS DESERVED
Wheres looney
Bucks in 6
When Celts at home, they are consistent, especially White wearing white. When Dubs at home, Green is inconsistent as he wears blue.
If Jaylen Brown steps up , they could upset the Warriors fr
Jaylen Brown gonna get a FMVP if they pull this off
Curry getting put to sleep this series
Draymond went out there and almost got a triple 0 in 35 minutes…. And y’all say he’s a HOFer?😂😂😂 the most overrated player in the NBA without a doubt
Lucky win
boston ako
Flop king
Idol jason mao diay emo gibiyaan c moira kai para maka fucos kas final hahaha baliki nya og ma champion mo hahaha congrats idol
The Warriors are still in shock from game 1. It time to sub Green and use K to guard Boston young guns.
There's too much threes it's getting annoying now what's the point of a center if your shoot threes the whole game
4-1 celtics
Nasaan n kau tga gsw fans? Ang iingay nyo ng manalo kau ng game2!   Ngaun ano n? Nganga!!
I LOVE YOU BOSTON CELTICS LETS WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Draymond😴😴😴😛🤣🤭
Why only showing Warriors made points most of the time.
Kobe with the Celtics
The 4th quarter collapse is completely out of control for the Warriors. Kerr needs to make some serious adjustments
Man, Steph Curry got absolutely HUNTED tonight, everyone was looking for that one on one matchup, especially Tatum 😅
When our Bulls grow up we're gonna be just like one of these two teams 😭
what is so sad is that i was cheering on warriors the whole time and when it was 83-82 i was so happy but it ended when the warriors lost 100-116 :(
Congrats boston
Kerr took Curry out when the momentum was rolling in their direction, same thing he did with Klay. I don't know why he always takes guys out when they're hot
Draymond had more fouls than points 💀 Less trash talking more buckets
What the hell happened here?
I think these two teams are hell-bent to prove that you can play a close seven-game series without playing one single close game.
can we have a petition to take the score out of video thumbnail?
Mr Triple-Single, Draymond Green is being exposed as useless and average. All talk and a self-inflated sense of self, when he's being outperformed by Al Horford, who's like a million years old.
The Celtics in the 4th Quarter held the Warriors to just 11 points. 11 POINTS! Their defense is insane🔒
Gsw need to try putting Kuminga on action they need some size and athleticism, they give away so many rebounds or Moody with his hustle plays
Thank you Kyrie Irving for taking your cancer somewhere else. signed, boston =)
China Klay today.
"KD needed Steph" "Kobe needed Shaq" when are these casuals going to learn?
Klay getting "hurt his feelings" flashbacks
Just realized that if Boston wins this year, they’ll have 1 more championship than the Lakers 😭
Gang Green.
Small ball Warriors sucks no rebound I smell 3-1 coming.
In my opinion, i feel the warriors will win Friday game, and win at home bringing the series to 3-2. Then lose and bring the series to 3-3. The championship game will end in Golden states stadium. I still have warriors as the slight advantage though, because they do adjust after each loss, and they will not lose at home again, plus they will have to beat Celtics at least one time on their turf, which they will
Love when Draymond comes back down to Earth 😂 and realizes his triple single is not gonna work here 😂
Golden state and curry didn’t score anything in the fucking 4th quarter! Seriously man, when it becomes clutch they fucking fold like a rookie poker player
Golden state has a really bad game from start to finish. Bad defense,  bad rebounding effort,  curry always caught on mismatches, finding himself defending horford on the paint without a help. Draymond taking wide threeball and miss badly. Thompson,  having a good shooting game but forces a lot of contested shot that in the eyes of ordinary player was a bad shot. If They show the way they show today,  Boston will definitely be crowned as a champion after game 5
Boston rockin!
Green played like a *t
Kuminga might be able to help on Tatum.
Congrats Boston
Gsw defence lacking
Jaylen Brown is finals mvp if they win
Warriors need to trade draymond he get paid too much money for defense and bunch techs and talk but this isn’t the 90s. Warriors are playing 3 against 5 with him and looney on the court. Huge Warriors fan but never been Dray fan.
Honestly uk how much better we would b with out Draymond he's a liability honestly imagine Steven Adams or that type player
Warriors at Celtics
Can’t wait to tell my kids game 3 was GSW’s first appearance on ice skates because every position looked like the same rehearsed bullshit.
Who won?
2 more games to go.🏆
If Robert Williams looks like this for the remainder of the series, the Celtics are winning the title.
Love seeing Draymond Green get manhandled
Unlike game 1, Boston weren't so tenacious last game 2 because they know on their minds that they got what they want on game 1 and that they have an advantage going to this game 3 because they will play on their home court advantage until game 4.
Celts out hustle warriors. Hungrier
2 DOWN, 2 TO GO!!!
when draymond jumped on jb during a loose ball, that was a foul, but whem al horford jumped on currys legs, no foul - what bs
Al hordord to win a championship ring...tsk tsk tsk f...k you
drays lay up was insane hahaha
Get caught switching off to another man, and then Boston with Tatum goes right to the basket.
This Celtics team is just too good.
I've said it in the beginning, ill say it again, the warriors are going to struggle to win with Wiggins.  It doesn't matter how much he scores or what he does, his value is holding the warriors back, always has and always will be.  I feel sad curry has this trash ass player on his team when he could of easily gotten much better help offensively and defensively.
This Celtic's team bruh
What a game, and what a win for the Celtics!!!!!🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
Warriors is washed up . They are done.
The problem with the warriors is they keep taking 3point shots withour any rebounder inside the paint. Too confident that they will hit all their shots but unfortunately they missed...
Its so wholesome to have Mike Breen back for the finals
Man how you have a Robert Williams so tall and quick at the same time that hounds you anytime on the perimeter and the paint. The Time lord is cheese.
The Warriors are undersized compared to the Celtics.
Give Curry a pacifier
Now let’s ask Draymond for his prediction on Game 4.  😂
Now stfu Warriors, we serious this time.
It's not over till it's over... Warriors will bounce back in a big explosive way 💪💪💪
I hate it, but how many players on Golden State let Tatum- Smart play the way they wanted to and golden state would guard them up to 14 seconds and somebody would leave either the ball or
Keep underestimating the Boston Celtics nba fans, I think ya have seeing enough to see the this is your 2022 NBA champions
Celts up 2-1. In critical game 4 watch for draymond to kick Tatum in the balls. Or watch for a golden state defender to undercut Tatum or smart on a jump shot so that they land on the foot of a warrior, and take out tatums ankle, injuring Tatum. This dirty trick is what warriors did a few years ago to the ankle of kwahi Leonard on a Leonard jump shot
Basketball struggles to keep my attention. So predictable... I'm over it !
Celtics exposed Chef curry defense
Boston did it,gsw get foul trouble.attack and aggresiveness win today
i mean i like the fact they lettin em play but sum of these was like ok this isn't football 🙄. celtics in 7
@nba curry traveled on the step back and wiggins traveled 9:23
I pray they win.
I know this is off topic but can someone please explain to me why that dunk in transition by Andrew Wiggins late in the fourth is not called a travel 🤔
Team hustle always wins
Go tatum
That Jayson Brown be the mvp of this series.
Whoever Steph Curry checking they need to just cook him ...
Draymond didn't find any favoring in this game by the refs guess home court advantage is good for something 😊
To think that LeBron James single handedly destroyed this Celtics team in 2018 is absurd 🤯
16 ang lamang Sawsaw GSW.
Beat the seltics
Gsw y’all are finished !
It is fixed.
Curry poor defender
Boston has to keep the intensity up. Udoka has to really go into his trick bag
Why is it every time gsw got the ball they scary asf
WTF Celtics Beat The Lakers in 2010 What an Announcer The Lakers Beat The Celtics in 2010 That's How Kobe Bryant win a Back To Back Championship From 2009 and 2010 And Back To Back MVP what an fucking announcer do you have an amnesia 🤣🤣🤣
Wow, watching this made me happy! That's what we call BASKETBALL.
Lets go wariors
sheesh
Game 4 will be interesting
5:21 Draymond Green's goal
The nearly full court bullseye pass by Horford was amazing.
Bye GSW. Horford ended the series earlier by a Kawhi-like-career-ending foul. 18th
Espn is sickening. Just went there, all they show from the game is Currys 3rd quarter 15 points.  Smh. Gtfo. Yeah howd those 30 points help? GS got blown out. Down by 20 plus,  double digits. Boston let em come back as we always shit the bed in 3rd quarter.   Then we went back to work and nearly win by 20.    Boston is ha ing its way w GS.  Keep it hoing Boston!!!  Take care of business at Home!!!!  Take care of your business!
The refs being terrible this whole searies they call fouls when the players dont even do nun smh
No excuses y’all beat nobodys
Robert williams bullied green
Golden state like : wish kd here.. Boston: =p
Brown crazy glued himself to Klay on that one play😯
GSW FOR GAME 6
Warriors should bench draymond and let Looney/Porter Jr have those minutes. Draymond effect on the game is just overrated. Porter Jr is a bigger threat, better shooter, and better defender because of size. Draymond makes too many mistakes, can’t finish and doesn’t add enough value to compete. He’d be a better option coming off the bench to fire everyone up
Fkin ushers in MSG I LEAVE MY SEAT TO GET MY BURGER AND I RETURN WITH SOMEONE ELSE IN IT
Let them have there little victory . Warriors will win and there’s no stopping them .
This game was won on the 50/50 ball 22 points off it!!
Celtics defense is crazy. Im a new NBA fan and watching this game had me on the edge of my sheet chewing my shirt from anxiety.  Klay Thompson don’t be hittin those shots tho :/
Celts just seem to have fresher legs. They were on everything. Warriors are a step or two slower.
So many dunks...
The chemistry of j.brown & r.Williams 🔥🔥
Fuck Boston
This Celtics team is on a mission. They have the fire inside them that is unmatched by gsw.
Rob Will is a beast
oh yeah !!!!
Game 3 in Boston: Celtics win by 16. Despite the disconcerting efficiency of the Warriors (particularly Thompson and Curry, of course) on 3-point shots; despite a worrying number of failed layups by Tatum (perhaps lingering pain in his right shoulder); despite a comeback from Golden State to take the lead; despite all this, no panic among Celtics players. Excellent management of the court and the bench by Coach Ime.  Obviously, he repeated the strategy used during a game against Miami: in the first quarter, go for the 2 points with each attack to thus ensure to take the lead and reserve the luxury of 3 points during the quarters following.  It had worked against the Heat, it had the same result against the Warriors. Smart (again the rock in Curry's shoe), Brown and Williams III: Giants! In San Francisco, the Celtics won Game 1 and were completely downgraded in Game 2.  Players will now need to remember what tripped them up so they don't have the same result. Boston leads the Finals 2-1. Game 4, this Friday at TD Garden: "Let's Go CELTICS!"
Daming talo sa pusta dito hahaha
that was a beautiful brand of basketball we saw today
When Williams shows up Celtics are very hard to beat! Give them hell Robert!
THE TWO WILLIAMS AND THE WHITE ARE THE X  FACTORS FOR THE CELTICS. PLUS THE SMART PLAY WITH BROWN TATUM WILL MAKE CELTICS A HARD TO BEAT EVEN IN THE WARRIORS COURT. CELTICS IS A STRONG DEFENSIVE TEAM. WARRIORS WILL FIND HARD AND DIFFICULTY IN BEATING THE CELTICS. IT WILL BE A GREAT SERIES, MAY BE GAME 7 OR GAME 6. DEFENDING ON THE PLAYERS HEALTH AND  MENTAL  PREPARATION FOR EVERY GAME.
Warriors in what?🤣 Celtics in 6
CELTICS WE LOVE YOU...
I think it’s safe to say jaylen brown is better den klay right now
I badly want Draymond to lose everything.
Steph suck a bitch. In that 4 point play he threw himself at the Celtics player can’t believe that got called
Keep attacking the key 👎Make that defense collapse
Incredible series. There is big momentum for Celtics rn.
Dramond Green looking like my overall 60 my player on 2k
What a help from the ref Horford almost break curry's foot and still no call
every time curry is held, it should be foul, celtics 4 or 5 guys would foul out, celtics paid the regs
draymond green is the most overrated player in the history of the nba. he’s absolutely garbage. fucking bum ass
just think brooklyn nets swept by the celtics and the defending champion beat the celtics don't underestimate the boston celtics
It's funny no one would have thought the Celtics would be in the playoffs because they were playing really bad basketball and were in 10th I believe with the same team they have now and made it all the way to the Finals.
When LeBron is in the finals the highlights gets million views in 1 hour.
Robert Williams is finally healthy. Not a celtics fan but this is bad for warriors and draymond.
Boston is to big only thing the warriors could do is shoot 3s it works but as ya saw they stopped making them live by the 3 die by the 3
Today's playoffs: 3-point shots. 90s playoffs: skill, physicality, 3-point shots, and originality. Nothing exciting here.
GSW has no big center no rim protector the Celtics has having a field day driving in for two , GSW they're rely too much on their guards 3 pts shooting but these guards are also a liabilities in their defense
Kerr is getting outcoached. Just like Game 1, Celtics start the 4th with their big lineup with Williams, and Kerr makes the same mistake and doesn’t put in Looney and we get bullied on the boards and Celtics drive to the basket every time cause we have no rim protector.   Let this sit with everyone - Green played 35min and had 2pts and 4 reb. Looney only played 17min and had 6pts, 7reb and 3 assists. Looney needs more min!!
To draymond green , Stop with the podcasts and social media nonsense you have been doing  Focus on the finals solely  There would be lot of free time in the offseason
The passing by the Celtics in this game was the best I’ve seen in a long time
BC is the better team plain and simple
Celtics in 5 🤣🤣🤣
Warriors are too small. If they don't come out smoking back to back 3's, they will never get a enough rebounds to stay in a game. So many times tonight I watched three to four Warrior bodies under the rim, only for Horford to come up with it.  They either blow out or get shut down.
COME ON WARRIORS FUKK MOEEE 😢
All holfrod gustong lumpuhin si step curry
Ya casi casi dos más  y a celebrar su añorado título los celtics... C"s-4 W"s-2. Llora nene llora
The Warriors go win next game bro 😖
Every shot Gsw made was sorry
Warriors in jeopardy damn
Warriors ain't what they used to be.
Amazing, dominant performance by Celtics! Marcus Smart didn’t even have that great a game with 5 turnovers & only 3 of 7 3pt shots! If Smart has a better game 4 it will be even harder for Warriors! 😂🤣🤷‍♂️
Let's go Boston!
What am i witnessing right now?!?!
GP2 defense lol overrated 2:04 and 7:22
nobody can guard tatum and brown…but anyone can switch up on curry…this will be 4-2 in favor of the celtics
go Celtics
THE TIMELORD IS LEGIT
Boston has a great momentum 👏🏻 going into game 4.
Splash bros lost their splash. Lol
I can just see it now golden state ain’t winning shit away
Marcus Smart hustling all over
Celtics in 6 promised❤
I'm waiting for flight to react to dis.... 😭😂
They should have played Wilt Chamberlain Jr. a little longer and history might just repeat itself.
Little Curry and klay are soft and fragile! All they do is shoot threes. They gonna phone call ledrama and  cupcake next year to help them.
Lifetime Celtics fan here, I want to hate the warriors but I don’t. I only hope the Celtics win this finals
lmao, who told Green he could guard Brown? A DPOY in his own mind.
I just watched golden state on ice
Walang depensa gsw napaka malowag.
Podcast Dray shows up more than in game Dray. Big time garbage.
Every time golden state got the ball it’s like they were on ice
If Wiseman is playing this is like a  walk in the park for GSW
12 yrs sheesh. LeBron really was the eastern conference lmao
Who is homie @ 7:47
Nothing is more satisfying than beating the shit out of Golden ass
Warriors only play good home
Warriors in 6
Boston in 6…. celtics to much of a team for the warriors….. they swept Nets… Beat the bucks…. and Miami….. hands down Boston….
Later suck ass warriors
The Boston Celtics defeated the Golden State Warriors, returning the favor by way of a blowout. The former did exactly what they were supposed to do by protecting their home court. Game number four, Friday night, June 10th, 2022. I still believe that the Golden State Warriors will win inside of six or seven games. However, the Boston Celtics has seventeen championships. Eleven belongs to the great William Felton "Bill" Russell.
I just luv Boston's size and ability to switch off.  And now The Celts got a really good center.  The older G.S. squad just couldn't keep up the pace tonight. Game 4 will be very interesting!
Go Tatum!!!
This is exactly why I drafted rob will in fantasy 😈
Golden state had trouble with Houston shake my head
WARRIORS IN 5 LOL
That’s good 💪👏👏🙌
If TL was fully healthy this would have been a sweep.
Bus rider Donkey in 3 games  15 pts 26% FG 0-7 3PT 5-10 FT  He has more turnovers than made buckets
Golden state is not winning at Boston
Yet to lose back to back games in the playoffs, amazing coaching. But why tf was Curry EVER on Tatum?! Cmon now
As long as the warriors lose everyone’s happy
Tatum f**k’d up my Q1 parlay smh ni**a you wearing Kobe sneakers and Kobe armband and can’t play through a shoulder stinger, lame, Kobe tore his acl and shot free throws after and then walked off the court you ain’t GoatBryant bro
I’d like to thank the Brooklyn Nets for giving the Celtics Tatum, Brown, Coach Udoka and taking Kyrie away. We really owe this one to them. They are the Celtics minor league team.
Good Job for Boston not jacking up 3s. They need to keep attacking the rim. Cause Warriors have zero interior defense.
So where's Warriors in 5?
If Celtics with the ship. Jaylen Brown getting MVP
Let’s go Boston that small ball shit is dead and poole has to snap for them to win draymond is shitty and old he need to go idc looney ass they need kat or somebody
Warriors are done
I do not understand why Kerr benched a hot Curry with 3 minutes left in the 3rd quarter with a chance to take a lead into the 4th.  Even if he had 4 fouls you have trust him to not pick up a 5th.   It's even more frustrating knowing that Curry usually plays all of the 3rd and usually rests in the 4th until the 8 minute mark.  Congrats to the Celtics. They took that 3rd quarter hit and responded in the 4th.  Warriors in 7.
9:30, Curry looks hurt
Celtics may go 3-1 after Friday. Hell Celtics could’ve been up 3-0 if they didn’t turn the ball over 36 times.
Go celtics for the champion
man what is Kerr doing sitting curry out late in the third. He always sits players out when they get hot and it's so annoying. The Warriors also struggled big time with rebounds
Why interview Curry, he has no true desire to win because whether he win or lose he will be talked about, he will get the multi-millions is scheduled to get paid each of several months that makes up a season. Many will talk about the points beside his name but not about the arrogant ball handling during crucial moments he displayed. Curry can " afford " to make the most idiotic ball handling combinations and passes he did. Remember when they were down by a few when he lost the ball not because of the defense given him, they were because of arrogant ball handling he did in the situation. When you know that in order for you to be on the court you can't make or do elementary mistakes, you will do your best to not showboat, but just do what is needed to accomplish the goal of getting the in towards the basket by a teammate or in the basket yourself. Because there are players whose paid is worth more than the integrity of the game, the games the many fans come to see will not get better. Paid players depending by their plays of  each game not the season, if your play cause the other team to score because of carelessness with passing or dribbling, you get a deduction in your pay for that game.
This is the team ainge envisioned when he had Hayward
Another Triple Single for Draymond...$25 million for this ? Points..........2 Rebounds....4 Assists.........3 LMAO....you no show
Haven't really paid attention to this Final. Seemed like a pretty close game,at least compared to the other 2 games. Just really not too interesting because both teams, particularly the Celtics, already have multiple championships.
Curry is not bad on defense but celtics abuse him on 4th quarter
https://youtu.be/5ZumbKQtf-8
The Celtics in the 4th Quarter held the Warriors to just 11 points. 11 POINTS! Their defense is insane!
Tatum should stop ball hogging in the 4th. If he tries to push for Finals MVP they will lose the series.
Draymond might be the loudest mediocre player of all-time. He’s rode steph and Klay his whole career and his worst season came when they were both out.
Ahh here we go again. So My Warriors fans, who's at fault for this lost. Oh don't worry Celtic fans I definitely give props to the Cels and JT balled out HOWEVER I'ma Warriors fan and I'm gonna keep it real. I don't wanna see Draymond act a fool but I do want to see him being more productive. In a game where Klay FINALLY came to life a little to go along with Curry's continued sizzling play, I expected more from the leader and add Poole to that mix. Everyone knew Boston was gonna come out with great intensity and once again the Warriors didn't match the effort. Just like the Warriors movie, Everyone is coming at them and gonna give a great effort and pretty much Everyone is clanking the coke bottles with their fingers screaming " Waaaaarrriiiioors, come out to Plaayaaaaaa". The only difference is We don't know the outcome at the end which means EVERY GAME, EVERY POSSESSION COUNTS and the Warriors failed tonight. We all knew the 3rd quarter run was coming and they did a good job coming back from 18 points total down to take the lead with the help of a 7 point trip. They showed poised  the Chef was cooking and then they took their foot off the gas. Once again they got sloppy with the 🏀 which led to unnecessary turnovers. Once again I BELIEVE Kerr and the coaching staff failed. Why in the WORLD would you sit Curry after the timeout when he was cooking late in the 3rd quarter. I get it dude probably needed a blow but he gotta play through that if all possible. Also they're getting beat on the offensive rebounds, which were resulting in 2nd chance opportunities for Boston and Kerr fails to make adjustments. KUMINGA is Sitting on the FREAKING bench when he can give a couple of minutes or maybe more because I see him thriving in a game like this but since he's "Inexperienced" he's only getting garbage minutes. He's one of the reasons they're still playing. I see the Warriors making adjustments once again but these players need to come with that fire from the start OR their season will be OVER in the next 2 games. Whatever they're smoking at halftime they need to get a hit at the beginning and play like they're season depended on it. Fight back from 18 to grab the lead and momentum only to lose the lead because they couldn't defend and turnovers and lose by 16 is unacceptable. "Warriors come out to Plaayaaaaaa" and I mean that. Let's Go Warriors..
Good game Celtics!
Warriors have the best player and the celtics have about the next top 6-7 players after him lmao. It's just clear as day the Celtics are younger, more physical and the more talented team. Celtics in 6
Let's go warrior's
Curry a nut with those threes
who says defense doesn't win championships? Oh yeah...Shaq. 🤣 Celtic defense is legendary this season.
Dub nation ? More like scrub nation
Id give dray one more game... Then think about cutting mins... His impact was minimal tonight
2 more ☘️
Golden state battled back but couldn’t quite gain the lead. Good effort by GS. The Celtics held it down and withstood the GS comeback and maintained a good stronghold over this game. If your a Cs fan you definitely should trust your team. Golden state losing game 1 was BIG. I had GSW winning this series in 7 but after Game 1 i changed my pick to Boston in 6. This series is unpredictable and no one knows who can beat who until its over.  This Boston team is just a tad bit stronger in my opinion than GSW curry has what it takes but ultimately i think he’s just too small to carry this squad without another partner. Klay has to show up for at least 20 points a game from this point on. Draymond has to produce on offense no iff’s ands or buts. This was a hard fought game on both ends. Celtics fans should feel pretty good going into the next game. Good game . Golden state has to take control and not look back.
Good game  It's easy from being over. The beginning of  game 4 WILL be super intense. Boston will be trying to get out the gates fast to try to take complete control of the game AND maybe the series. GSW will be coming out to battle for footing in this series.
Here comes Sac12 and LeUltrainstinct sharing their 1 braincell
Warriors in 6 lol ?
ROB..WIL..RABOUND WINNING THE GAME...AND BALL PASSING..TEAMATES..WOWWWW
As the late great Don Meredith would sing“turn out the lights the party’s over .” Celtics win in five. The Warriors have no answer to their size and rebounding. Turns out they do need Durant to try to outscore a team like Boston. The Warriors are soft! No dynasty. Three and three in the finals is only .500. Plus the Warriors played three cupcakes to get to the finals and the Celtics played three tough great teams to make it.Barkley is thrilled.
The Celtics in the 4th Quarter is a nightmare to face against. They would shut down everybody and then score bucket after bucket on offense.
GS fans it's still Warriors in #5🤣🤣#BC4L
for curry being the best shooter of all time, i have zero trust in him making a 3 when it's not a single possession game and golden state is down. he has to be one of the worst clutch players i've seen.  still got warriors in 7. dray and wiggins gotta pick it up a bit, and klay is still yet to find his sweet spot, but he's still coming back.
C's muscled their way for the win on this one. Men vs boys.
Size definitely proved to be a factor this game for the Celtics. And AL Horford just good at making the right plays and out hustling the Warriors he does all the lil things that make all difference for this Celtics team.
This year celtics champion nba guaranteed
Boston Celtics 2022 NBA Finals Champions 🏆
I think Boston knows they cant out-perimeter GSW, so theyve done a  good job of the next best thing: negating the long bomb with top-class defense.
I told y'all!! Al Horford GOTS to play excellent!!!!
this games officiating was actually very good.
P
Draymond the real mvp
full of ads tsk
Welcome back Mike Breen. Don't have to listen to that insufferable balloon head Mark Jones. BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!!!!
Robert Williams is 6′ 9″ but he looks 7 foot
Me personally I would never let  draymond get in my face like that, but that’s just me.
Celtics got this in the bag!
Draymond Green made to a clown by Robert Williams
The celtics crowd energy was wild
Offense is great but great defense is beautiful to watch, Jalen Brown's defense on Klay was just awesome. Love this game when it's played well on both ends. Miss the defense part of the game, GO CELTICS!
Warrior's defense is like shit.
Steph Curry is the best shooter ever. That said, the way the Celtics destroyed him at will on defense, isolating him at every opportunity, shows exactly why he will never be a “Mount Rushmore” type of player. You can not be considered one of the greatest of all time and have to be hidden in a zone in order to stop the Celtics from gashing him. One of the commercials showed three highlights of the Celtics scoring and wouldn’t you know it? Steph the defender EVERY time. Truly great players are able to effect the game on each side of the floor. Celtics in 6.
no one talking about horford’s cross court pass? not even the camera knew it was coming and the way al was beckoning urgently for the ball
Stephen no defense curry
One thing is for sure GS is way overrated as a team.
Eat that draymond 💀🤣
Celtics have a better odds in winning this years Championship..
A very good shooting night of the celtics team,  almost every any angle..🔥
Holy cow just how many 3PAs were made in this game..
LFG
@6:05 flop
Robert Williams was the x-factor for the win. The trio of Tatum, Brown and Smart did much of the damage, but Williams emerged as the much-needed extra kick to seal the deal
Shame that's all Curry can do is jump shoot.
they just have to keep an eye on curry thompson and the crazy poole and they’ll be the 2022 champs
Very disappointed ....always the gsw a slow starter !!!!.... They think that they can always catch up with the score .... really disappointed !!!!
Jordan Poole is so femenine its disturbing I hate his game. Wiggins is not that guy lebron look like a genius for trading him b4 he played 1 NBA game Jimmy Butler was right too. Steve Kerr got out coached my goodness kuminga buried on the bench AI cant get no PT Looney need more time Steph should've played the entire 3rd. My biggest takeaway Jordan Poole mannerism and game bothers me. Steph has alot to over come this series...
Green has to be traded….fuck his ball iq. This man is Atrocious  on offense
Where are the people saying the warriors are so ahead of everybody??
Excellent defense from the Celtics.  When the Warriors started to come back Celtics kept up the defense and finally started to pull away.
Chicken curry is crying in game 3
Boston just better,  on D, on O,  just better in post.
It always blows my mind that we score a total of 2 points in every 4th quarter.. unless we have a 200 point lead going into the 4th I’m almost certain we are going to lose. Very upsetting. Lost the series.
My finals start from now onwards  Cuz "breen is back "
Jaylen Brown is shining and letting everyone know his name this series. What a monster performance offensively and defensively.
why does this finals seem kinda boring
O lord why?
Looks like that blown Game-1 is coming to bite the Warriors.
Saw a guy wearing a Draymond jersey in the crowd, I just felt bad honestly. Washed up player trying to find a reason to stay relevant as a starter 😭 even Iggy a better starter fr
Rob Williams:  8 pts (80% FG), 10 rebounds, 3 steals, 4 blocks. +21 in +/-
Gotta give it to Tatum, his play making has improved so fkn much
Warriors fans are toxic.
Draymond green... had a quadruple single.  2,3,4,6....point,rebounds,assist and fouls.. one of the truly worst performances I've ever seen In  a nba game.. for how long he played. Plus not good defense at all. I forget how many turnovers he had to
The Warriors need size and toughness. Whenever physical games are allowed by the Refs, GSW struggles. And there is too much asked of Curry for someone of his size.
Curry: klay, you know something. What is it?  Klay: I’m scared steph.  Curry: bs you ain’t afraid of no man.  Klay: there’s something out there waiting for us… and it ain’t no man… we’re all gonna die.  Draymond: man’s losing it. He’s losing his cool. There’s nothing but a couple leprechauns running around out there and we gotta take ‘em down.
if the warriors actually put some effort and tried to box out on defense, they would've won the game. draymond green is becoming a liability in the finals
The Celtics size is controlling the game.  The Warriors can't handle the physical force of Boston. Power is winning against speed. Nice win for Boston. 😎👏👏👏🏀🌴💯
Golden State is in trouble.  If they lose game 4, they will be down 3-1.  Good game regardless of the fact, there are NO superstars on either team.  Boston is just too BIG.  They were out-boarded: 47 to 31.  This is a lot.  Curry SHOWED UP.  Green 2-points, 4-rebounds.  He needs to put up or shut up.  Jaylen and Tatum BALLED!!!
Dubs' champioship aspiration getting dimmer it seems
U most def tell rim was higher For GS first Half
RIP to all of the dudes that were saying "wArRioRs iN 5"
11 points in the 4th quarter for the warriors in the finals? That’s gotta be a record right?
wariors defence sucks  they cant contest with the big guys
The length & athleticism of Boston is just hard for GS to deal with. The wings + Robert Williams are a tough matchup for anyone defensively.
Hell nah, Warriors can't afford to lose the next game or it's the end for them
Them Celtics Played Tough Tonight 😶
Boston celtics for the win
☘️☘️☘️
WHEN will Curry be scrutinized for continuously crumbling in close 4th quarters in the playoffs. He scored ZERO points in the last 6 minutes in game 1 and scored ZERO points in the last 7 minutes tonight
horford was dirty
Draymond is just too small for Robert Williams, and Draymond is not a scoring threat from outside.  The Warriors got out rebounded when Looney is not in the game, and when Looney is in the game, the Celtics can defend the limited scoring threats on the floor, with their superior length.  If Poole and Wiggins don't knock down some threes, to supplement the offense and spread the floor the Warriors have a problem.  The Celtics were fine with giving Wiggins open looks at the three point line, and happy to chase Curry and Klay off the three point line because they know they have rim protectors waiting behind them.   Boston had eleven more shot attempts and nine more free throw attempts.  Hard to win when the other team has that many more chances to score.
Let’s gooooo Celtics!!!!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️😤😤😤🔥🔥🔥
8:57 the way JB locked down Thompson 😭🔥
Warrior Fans be like ::: Warriors in 6 😂😂
Great win by the Celtics.  Theyre really putting pressure on the refs to give GS all the calls next game to keep this series going
Warriors choke 4th quarter... They had the momentum on the start of the 4th quarter
The habit of Kerr taking out a hot player, will cost them this series
Hey remember when the spurs were whooping the warriors and zaza intentionally injured kwhai, karma is a b, just make sure that b is beautiful 😍...bye bye warriors bye bye
Any Warriors fans here? What is your reaction? I still think Warriors will win in 6.
Why in a the fuck dose kerr continue to sit curry when the lead is in grasp ..he consistently allows curry to sit while the lead expands.. he did it today . When he say curry the bottom of third when the warriors where on a run .. and green has to be benched at this point period
Balbal baboy sud an!!!
Now I see why we lost are defense is all over the fucking place smh
Boston Wins Game #4 Is It Championship Time ?
Celtics in 5
Where’s Draymond defense at I don’t see it haha
Celtics in t
Celtics are legit to put healthy dubs in this situation. But Warriors in 7.
KLAY SUX FKN BALLS! He cost us the game! How long is dumb ass coach kerr ridin his sorry ass??
bruh rob Williams kills dubs on rebound and defense 😂
Somehow Lebron will be mentioned tomorrow on ESPN & FS1
Robert Williams got some great defense🔥
Poole party where?
Let's go Celtics
Would’ve ruined my night if they lost
Booooowariors eastern in the best
Draymond is handicapping the warriors offense but because he’s a “lockdown defender” he’s still starting🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love it that is Steve Kerr
An end of a dynasty. Warriors fucked up when they used the 2nd pick. Should've gotten a star center. Should've also traded the pick used for Kuminga to get another star while getting off Wiggins' contract. Wiggins is nice but his contract is just too big.
JB!
Steve Kerr is killing the momentum of Stephen Curry especially in the 3rd Quarter. I mean how in the world that you benched your superstar when he's hot.
boston make history this season
I just really hope both teams had fun!
Last Boston win. Mark my words!
Damn.  Boston. Ain't playing  around.
Worriors  please rebound
Ahh let's go warriors warriors in 6 love from Canada
whhhhhyyyyy?
GO Boston!!!!
Celtics D is nasty.
To all my Warriors fans...  We're down but not out 😔 Put your heads up,we'll bounce back. Congratulations Celtics we see you on Friday.
R. Williams gonna get his 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀 when its time.....
again, the East is a lot tougher than the Warriors' path to the finals. as great as a shooter curry is, there is no room for weakness in these moments. deal with it. a few hits, and he clinches. curry size is gonna get whacked as this series goes longer. they must close it as early as possible if they wanna get out of there alive. Lets go Celtics!
I'm sooo happy to be a Boston fan..🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀 reminds me of the 2007-2008 team..
Waiting for flight to react this
These are the games where a healthy and focused James Wiseman is! needed! Great job Celtics I can't stand y'all but I called you winning the series in 7!
2 points, 3 assists, and 4 rebounds in 35 minutes. I’m sorry but Draymond Green is not the greatest defender of all time. Not even close! And he’s probably the most OVERRATED enforcer in NBA history. The dude literally has no affect on the game. Andrew Wiggins had more affect on the game, and his defense shows way more than Draymond’s.
Curry: W Klay: W Wiggins: W Poole: W Looney: W  Donkey: 💩🧻
Thats the Tatum we all want to see. Taking control of the game and attacking the rim.
Warriors dynasty is over Celtics have figured out there system and do it better
Ang laki n Ng panalo ko sa Boston na to.iyakan na Yan.hahaha
Thanks the refs, the Celtics won the momentum right out of the gate and never look back.  Good job zebras.  This is why I hate NBA.  It's not really home court advantage but more like referee advantage.  They basically squashed any momentum the Warriors have.  Right from the start, you can clearly see that any slight bump is a foul against the Warriors.  However, if the Warriors drove to the basket and did the same, they get no call.  Right away, I knew it's going to be a long night.
Draymond Green best barking player all talk only
They decided to stop letting Steph and his screener play 2 on 1, and he actually missed a couple of contested shots. Who woulda thought?
Warriors and Lakers fans easily the worst in the league.
Jesus almost every bucket the Celtics scored was on curry 😂😂he’s a liability on defense
Robert Williams with the intangibles
Good game
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gs took lead and we just built it back. Boston is a better team overall.
Stephen Cry😂😂😂😂😂😂
Celtics is one dirty ass team. First the basket height mishap. And then the injury. Curry has been injured twice this season and both against Celtics. And it's only Curry, no one else. Once is maybe a mistake. Two times is a fucking choice.
once again Steph Curry showboating & acting like James Harden on every shot & Draymond thinking he's the new Dennis Rodman, at this rate the series will won by Boston in the next two games
And that folks was the 1st Qtr Jaylen was gonna have in game2 if the refs weren't clowns.
Celtics in 5! See you next season overhyped warriors
Draymond Green everybody! Talks bs the whole game and fouls out with a solid stat line of : 2 points 3 assists 5 rebounds Now everyone go listen to his podcast so he can talk about how great he is!
Draymond is way too emotional lol he can't score I think he needs to be replaced next year.
Warriors need a closer. curry chokes in the 4th and klay is just a shooter. Durant was the missing piece to the puzzle and draymond ruined it by making him leave
If Boston can get there 3rd quarters better we blow em out.
GSW in 5! 😆
C's in 5
Hi KD
Gogogoboston
Celtics about to ha e kd kyrie giannis jimmy and curry pack LMFAO
Lets go Celtics!! Brown started out hot n the offense looks so good running thru him. In the end Brown defense was amazing too. Good team win. This is such a fun series to watch no lead is safe the way both team can shoot.
Warriors gotta figure out how to get a defensice board
We need Wiseman😢
F the celtics they’ve only won 1 chip in modern NbA F them boston fans🤮🤣. Warriors winning 3 straight game😤
My life will be complete sports wise if the Celtics win this series. Can't stand SC,DG and Steve Derrrrrrrrr. Ass Clowns the 3 of them.... GS just has a Creppy Team. (  ;;
Green is so unlikable😅🤣😂
I dont understand y if youre golden state you dont get physical with Tatum.  Knock him around put him on the floor a couple times.  Dude is good but hes not physical.  You'll take Boston right outta the series if you play physical and take him out his game
All about money, not wins. NBA and ABC-TV need 7 games to make millions. Players know that, that is why the Warriors took the night off. Next game, Celtics will take the night off. Only Game 7 will be the unfixed game.
9:00 can we talk about thay crazy defense and the block by Jaylen????!!!
Browns crossover  Awes me
Celtics are out for blood. Them boys hungry. GS better wake up.
Poole need to stop dribble the ball around and do what Curry did.  He's always open at the initial start of pick n roll.  Why aren't you shooting?  He's already open....what the hell does he want?  I don't think he need to anything else.  If you drive, you're going no where...but my point, he is always open after the initial the pick n roll.  Curry shoot it all the time and being aggressive.  Why is this man hesitate?  That's the thing I don't understand.  He's a hell of a shooter and need to be aggressive and shoot.
GREAT GAME, GREAT SERIES.. THIS DESERVES A GAME 7 😍❤️👍💪
GS IN 5? I WANNA HEAR THAT AGAIN. SAY IT!
Gsw in 5
the celtics just out hustled the warriors. the only real difference was who wanted it more.
Boston outhustled GS this game and won because they played harder. Rebounds, second chance points, and defense. The intensity wasn’t there for Golden State but if they bring it next game they can tie it in Game 4.
Steph shouldnt rest on the end of that 3rd quarter...
i'll be waiting for ALL GSW EXCUSES.
RWIII did amazing on defense and I realized Celtics are taller than Warriors
Why the hell do we keep crushing in the 4th?!?!?
I love it. Let's Go Celtics!!!!!!
Let’s go C’s 🍀🍀🍀
Amazing game from the Celtics, let's keep this momentum going and win another one at home! ☘☘☘
Steph lost the game with his bad decisions at the beginning of the 4rth... Poole sucked, Draymond sucked. Warriors better hope Klay starts lighting it up along and that Steph is okay after Harfort landed on his leg.
Lynn Massachusetts in the houseeeee..  Celtics
Everyone: "Warriors in 5!" Celtics: _And I took that personally_
It’s going 7 games
The Poole party is missing 😅🤣😂
Poole and Wiggins have to give 35 per game to win this series
BOSTON GANG 💪🏿
wheres all the clowns that said warriors in 5 😂  haters are very quiet . sit down annoying warrior bandwagons 🤡
Did curry not play in the 4th?  Didn’t see any highlights
Boston was the better team tonight They played solid defense .. their size advantage showed as well. So good to have Klay back on track and Curry was a pleasure to watch, again! Entertaining game! .. The Warriors had flashes, Boston was steady, This ain't over, not at all!
First time I ever seen Draymond get Out hustled and outworked...Seems like every other made basket he was involved and couldn't make a stop...Because he's not a scorer his other strengths MUST be on full display or they won't win another game
Celtics 4-1
Marcus Smart driving the ball is incredible
Tatum, Brown and Smart put up great numbers ..but Robert Williams was the MVP of this game with his 10 rebounds and 4 blocks. When he’s on his A game he’s the most impactful defender in the league.
Warriors collapsed again in the fourth quarter 😥 only 11 points !
6:10 that Curry “foul” is Bs. He pulls his own version of a “Vlade Divac”. Go Celtics!
WTF is he talkin about in the beginning. The Lakers beat the Celtics in 7 games??????
Celtics deserves this win..  the hustle, teamwork and determination… congrats 👏   btw, i’m a GSW fan
Warriors frontcourt is simply too inferior to the celtics and its gonna cost the warriors this series
Celtics straight kicked out asses tonight.  No urgency.  No consistency.  Played soft and got our asses kicked.   We must play better Warriors or Celtics gonna Walk this home.   We gotta get thos split then go on top at our house.  Let's go Warriors.  Good game Celtics #Respect
Horford is a dirty player that’s all I gotta say.
Boston in 6
Them BOSTON BAKE BEANS🔥🔥💪
warriors gotta take there head outta there ass
Ppl forget this is the team that beat the bucks
Now warriors know what it's like playing a healthy team for the first time in the curry era in the playoffs.
Super frustrating how everyone wants to crown curry as one of the greats. Without a doubt he is the greatest 3 point shot maker we have ever seen! Number one reason being they can no longer hand check in the nba, so if you cant hand check and can't contest 3's then of course people are going to make more. But regardless the guy can shoot and no one can deny that. But he is a complete defensive liability and it's hard to watch. You watch the last 3 or 4 major baskets by the Celtics in the 4th quarter and they are all on curry! What a joke. If the Celtics just get a switch every play down the court, just the same way the cavs did with Kyrie when they won the championship, Tatum and brown would score on him every single time or he would have to foul them.
How draymond gonna talk about basketball in 80-90s but can barely do anything now.
We really need just two wins
I hope curry don’t lose out…it’ll be twice he done something historical in the season just to end up losing in the finals.
Wiggins and Poole needs to step up. of all the games in the Finals, this is the first time that Klay played well. Steph Curry is very consistent. he needs help from his brothers to win the Championship.
Damn u experian
This celtics team be givin me. 2013-14 spurs vibes and I love it.. They just have an answer to everything the dubs throws at em.  Still 2 more to go.
凯尔特人 加油
Boston just needs to win all home games from now on.
This series is over. Only way Warriors win is if Celtics beat themselves.
Shoot i guess my coworker was right, the celtics prob will win the chip. (I still wish miami was here instead) Then again who knows really. As long as the warriors dont win, im good
I think the Celtics got this.. and that’s I want to see 🙏🏽😋😁
Reason centics  won this game  Cox  44 Williams  in the  poor  guy  still  get  not  credit  it all.   What  a shame  from  media  in the  fans.
Ive send it from start of playoffs,  Celtics championship hopes dependent on Rob Williams Knees and his Knees only!
The 2022 Celtics might be one of the best 4th quarter team I’ve seen for years. They always outscore their opponents during the 4th.
Win r lose the ceo make 60 Mil. Im starting to quesion the nba . Smh
Come to think of it, the Celtics are basically what the suns were supposed to be these playoffs.
Larriors fans wya
Warriors about to win 2 in a row . Maybe even 3
It was the defense
At some point you have to address Draymond not being able to make an open 3 or drive. The Warriors can't continue to play 4 vs 5 on th offensive end. Also hold Steph accountable for his horrible passes.
I'll say it again. Curry offense is beyond spectacular but defense wise he is a liability.
Its frickin raining down in Boston jeez!
Draymond was getting cooked all game
GSW fans be missing from the comment section when they lose. 😂😂😂
TATUM KEEP FUELING LONZO. I ❤ ❤ ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘
Can’t stand Draymond Green
So who here commenting didn’t watch the game?
I'm Indian and I love Choken Curry
Warriors suck. Give away game 1 now suck tonight and Kerr as usual has no answers. Series was over when they lost game 1. Draymond stop being derelict in your responsibilities and flapping your mouth on stupid ass YouTube. You gave the bulletin material when you said you’ve ever been beat when healthy. Boston has that up in their locker in big fucking letters. Ass. What another waste of a season. You will NOT be back in the finals again. That’s a given. Tired of this team phoning in mediocre efforts. Can’t beat anyone other than Cleveland!! What a faux team. “We DNA champs”. You dumb ass chumps.
Warriors played sloppy defense and made bad passes. Draymond needs to attack the basket more or cut inside more after getting the ball he just passes it out so Celtics are not playing aggressively against him. Getting out rebounded was a big issue too. Defense got exposed in the first half when Tatum was getting the 1 on 1 with Steph with no help. Warriors got to fix some holes from this game to win this series.
They want a game 7
I told all the bandwagon Warrior fans that the one weakness yall had was the lack of height on the team. Yall said "lmao we have the best 3 point shooters ever, Warriors in 4/5 lmao no cap + ratio". Now you're down 2-1 after getting owned on the glass and in the paint. If the Celtics don't beat themselves with turnovers the Warriors have no chance in hell. Keep running your mouths though, Warriors in 4/5 right?🤣
I hope curry wins finals mvp so people stop saying that she is weak because of not having a finals mvp.
The Celtics out hustled the warriors this game they wanted it more and it showed I think the Celtics are too athletic for the warriors so far this series
where is the Modern Rodman ????????? haha
Draymond and klay are garbage
At this point, it’s Curry or bust for the Warriors. Boston is just too big and athletic, Robert Williams looks like Dennis Rodman Jr.
Bandwagon ass warriors fans hold this L
GG Celtics good win for you guys came out with more urgency then us but we not worried at least I'm not i don't know about other warriors fans but we played terrible in the first half credit to you guys of course. But that third quarter could have won the game for the Warriors if we play better those first quarters we could have won but again GG too you guys I don't care what the odds says after a team win the game 3 in the NBA finals Warriors in 6!!
None of the teams in the final are due to luck. Fighting spirit n lot of heart in both of em!
Brown green and white the best combination
This warriors fan don’t get it this Boston team is better then any team they played
Al horford trying to injured curry. What a desperate move to win a Championship title.
The Celtics always come to play defense. And this is coming from a Warriors fan. If the Warriors start playing better defense, they're gonna lose this series.
7💎5 ☘☘-1
Warriors in 5
if boston wins game 4 gsw are done
still warriors in 7. i hope boston don’t think the series is over just cause their up a game 😂
Golden state should trade Thompson for Harden.  Both teams would benefit & get what they’re missing.
Tonight was a flop show by the Celtics people really got to watch the whole game crap so rigged
Draymond: brb calling Lebron rn
I am rooting for the Dubs however at this point for all the distraction, turnovers and lack of productivity. The Dubs might as well bench Dray. Kuminga could give more points.
Celtics gonna regret this win
Congratulations to the C's. I'm so excited tonight because on Game 3, betted $500 and a sub-sandwich combo with fries and a fruit juice drink that the C's would win! and of course C's won tonight! So I won my bet and it feels just like winning the lottery! Lol
Ayun panalo 2.2points hehe
why does nobody usually win unless their in their home town. that's sad
All of yall are gonna hate me for this but hear me out. The warriors could've and should've won. Al Horford PURPOSELY tried to injure Steph and then they elbowed him in the stomach. The calls were terrible and I feel like the NBA is scripted now. Like the NBA decides who wants to win. This is a terrible take but it's a feeling I have. My NBA dreams are starting to crumble. I'm realizing that if this is true, I won't want to play in a league based on luck.  Don't hate me, me
Congrats to Boston for this win and a new NBA championship!!
Great game, warriors on 7
Referee Scott Foster is 13-0 in the playoffs for the Celtics
Put Curry on a Island with Tatum, & Brown with Draymond....Barbeque Chicken  Boston showing how to beat Golden State the right way.   Williams & Grant is playing they're Role  Golden State gotta feature Poole more & Wiggins, on that island ISO Motion. But the plays are designed for Curry which hurting Klay too  Boston winning in Golden State set the tone, let's see how Boston play next game. This game Boston wanted it more, they smell the rock❗
iyak na nanaman sigurado mga gsw fans tsamba nanaman daw haha
Let’s go 2 more baby !!
warriors in 7
Boston! Are you smelling the gold nearing you? Don't lose your sight, Fight!
Go Celts Go!
Draymond fouling his guy on every play in these highlights
Curry coming up small in the big moments is killing the Warriors. 0 points in the last 6 minutes of Game 1. 2 points 3 turnovers in the 4th quarter of Game 3.  Triggered Curry fans reply below!
It's a team effort and Team warriors was not there tonight.  Dray better be aware that Lebron is looking to take his position.
Pakyu Roy HAHAHAHA 2-1 NA
Boston is a young team
the warriors coaching staff kind of dropped the ball on this one. Unless i missed something and looney got hurt i wasn't able to 100% focus on the game i was watching from far away watch individuals from far away lmfao. I just didn't see looney in and they got out rebound. freaking can't box out bounce dudes who can just poke the ball away. The celtics probably shot the ball 20-30+ more times then the warriors lol all those rebounds.
draymond is so trash you should not be aloud to talk trash when you cant even play you talk all that shit just to go scoreless let bench player drive right thru you when you said last year you think you the best defender in nba history at first i said we should keep green because he so important to are team but na we need to trade green to the heat for sombody like pj tucker or ben simmons
GSW is old
2 more
Game 3 MVP: Steve Kerr  1. Why do u feed Wiggins 3 that he barely made??  2. Poole did not contribute offensively that much. Why??? He was fire on G2.  3. Hot rod Curry on Q3 got benched. Whyyyy, Kerr? Why did u let the momentum dry up?  4. Payton seems so weak defensively tonyt.   5. Boston’s players did great tonight but I think Kerr can pivot some plays and players to counteract.
Green should get his face punch for trying to pull Tatums arm off on the freethrow... The dude gets a pass at the stupidest shits...
I have seen the future. BOSTON CELTICS will win the series 4-1.
JB setting the tone early at 1st... great performance of the dynamic Jays!
Kerr put curry on tatum in the last 6 minutes? 😅
GOOD DEFENSE BY THE REF ND CELTICS😂🎉
Let's go Boston Celtics ya is going to win all the NBA finals NBA KEEP THE VLOGS COMING 💯💯💯👍👍👍CHAMPIONSHIP
still think they don't need kd?
As cavs fan, I just love seen golden state fan cry
2021-2022 NBA Champions Golden State Warriors.....or bust
Satisfying
The Warriors need KD
Warriors in 5 they said
Gsw need a good center.
Steve Kerr just loves small ball, he needs to play the bigs he has more, did bealecia even play at all?
I hope steph feels better🙏
Its lookin like they only gon win at home
Did the warriors even score in the 4th
the warriors don't have a legitimate big man and the celtics need to keep exposing that. looney is undersized and definitely not robert williams. draymond is a great defender but he's still undersized. both of em will probably give them less than 16 rebounds a game. bjelica is a stretch four and was never a big rebounder or good on defense. they don't have shot blockers either. don't expect alotta rebounds from wiggs, klay and curry. they can't win when they get outrebounded by a big margin.
I just don't know what with Steve's mind taking out curry at the end minutes of the third when u had steph caught fire and on the road. It's a momentum swinger ryt there. You should let the guy finish those quality minutes steve and just rest him at the start of the 4th.  Ps: let kuminga play some quality minutes. He can defend both brown and tatum for sure.
Golden state got only 10 point in fourth quarter
Half way there but fully loaded
Of course Boston will win the chip, to protect Lebron legacy..
Warriors you’re gonna win the Championship 💙💙💙💙
Never expected that celtics will be this good
Green knew who babtised him, the real green☘️
Celtics came out to show they aren't chumps. Let's go Celtics! Only 2 more games! ☘️☘️☘️
Robert Williams needs finals MVP
CELTICS + REF VS WARRIORS
That was it. Right there... this game. If the Celtics were gonna fold, it was gonna be _this game._ Nobody can question the Celtics heart or effort. This team is pretty special.
TOO MANY BANDWAGON PINOY!
No matter what kind of game Steph has he can't do it alone and he can't do it without his defense stopping them. Klay at least played pretty good, but other players slacked.   Here's to game 4
If the boston get the dub. Smart should win the FMVP fr .
Warriors fans Y’all thought 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Celtics' defense showed up, it paid off tonight, especially Robert Williams had 3 steals and 4 blocks, this was a great all-around victory for Boston, everyone contributed as well, on to the next game🔥
as warrior fan, i guess its over already (30% chance of winning). there's a reason why the fourth quarter is always too difficult for them to score. bostons defense is really superior. i feel bad for curry, his performance is too good but not enough.
Smart need to stop with the wreckless passes.  Horford almost cost the game by his fouls and not closing in on Curry when he shooting for 3s.  Glad they fixed the issue in the 4th.  Tatum needs to make his layups and stop trying to make wild ass shots.
Williams taking the candy away from green like he a baby lmao
Celtics just bullied gsw in the 4th
Boston in 5
I bet KD on Twitter trolling Draymond 😂😂
It's not fair. Celtics technically have *2* coaches!
I'm going to need you knock'em out next game Dray
The one thing the Celtics did to wear Curry down was to attack him on Defense. Every time Tatum or whoever Curry was guarding they put him on an iso situation. Either get Curry in foul trouble or wear him out. Thats the key to winning this series
I HAVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE, DRAYMOND GREEN IS A ROLEPLAYER!!!!!!
Can’t wait for flight and osn to react to dis one 😂
Kerr ~ Give JK more minutes than Dray.  We need more offensive threats than defense.  SMH.  What are you waiting for?  Dray's stat tonight is garbage.
Celtics never lost two game in a row remember that. Y’all sleeping on the Celtics🤦🏾‍♂️🌚
Celtics too deep for them.
i love to see games where draymond is humiliated... guy just talks
Unpopular opinion: Draymond Green has been carried through the entire Warriors dynasty
DRAYMOND IS A BUM.  HE WAS GETTING HIS ASS WHOOPED THE WHOLE NIGHT! 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In a way, nothing has changed:  whichever team wins Game 4 will have the advantage.  This was true before Game 3, and it's true after Game 3.  Yes, Boston's advantage will be much greater if they win Game 4, but the Warriors will have home-court advantage again if they win Game 4.
The Celtics are just the much better team
So blurd fuck the uploder
God job ref😄
They got out rebounded more than anything. Forced a few passes that were unnecessary. I see the warriors taking it but it would definitely be seven games
If the Celtics win the Finals at this trajectory, Jaylen Brown has to be the  Finals MVP
Warriors fans go mute when they lose.
Curry is 0-4 in Game 3 without Durant 😂🤣 (2015, 2016, 2019.. 2022) 🤣🤣😂
Damn I can’t believe Boston won.
when you've been there (and won (multiple)) you have to dig up "the want" more than you used to. The C's want it. Do the W's want it more? we'll see.
GS is becoming the new Finals Cavs.
Beautiful
That Celtics team passes the ball well together, good team work…
They key to win the Championship for the GSW is to play Kuminga... To match the energy of Robert Williams
Message for Draymond: you got your splash brothers carrying the team on their shoulders this game and you do all that talk to drop 2 pts, turn the ball over, play no defence, not rebound, and foul out. All you gotta do is have 3 more good games, and we will win those 3 straight games. You set the tone for the warriors, so stop playing like ass. You are playing absolutely awful, when you are so close to winning the chip. Rebound the damn ball, don't turn it over, and play well. If you shoot and you feel like you're bricking everything, STOP SHOOTING AND BE AGGRESSIVE AND TAKE IT TO THE WHOLE. Just do this for the fans, trust us, we want it more than you do. We've been supporting so much, and just win this ring, and then you can go to Cancun or wherever for vacation and Warriors fans will be happy. Please.
Great performance from Green with that triple singles
Can these guys take it easy with the three's?
Go Boston Celtics 🏀💪
Flight not gonna like this one
Warriors need to play more physical
As a warriors have Celtics did do a great job. Although I love draymond with all his years in the NBA he couldn’t develop any top of offense. Even tho he is the heart of the team he is also a liability. Klay had a good bounce back proud of him. We basically just got out rebounded this game and made costly turn overs in the 4th that changes the momentum in the game. In order for the warriors to win every person needs to play their part. Warriors in 7.
Celtics win Game 3! Let’s go! 🤣💀.. 🏆🍀
they should play payton more minutes for his d
Draymond Green is the most overrated player in any sport of all time. He's averaging 5 freaking points per game in the 2022 finals.. He's a glorified "Mascot" that's all he is.....
Guthrie led the league in technical fouls called during the regular season. Foster and Kirkland both finished in the top 10 among referees in fouls called per 48 minutes, per NBARefStats. This game was rigged!!! Steph 4 fouls, Wiggins 4 fouls and draymond fouls out! Rigged!!
Wow another quadruple single by Dray including fouls...
That curry injury was scary . Hope it’s something he can just shake off
It's Gino Time
Boston just has too many all round players on they team 🤷🏾‍♂️
I fucking love this team
People from the mainstream media and feeling smart people discredit Rob. smh How stupid are they to do that. This man is an underrated player who gives his all in every game. Good game for the Celtics tonight, I hope the Warriors will give another good fight next game and don't disappoint the viewers.
If the Celtics can win this series JB definitely deserves FMVP!! Not to discredit JT, but Brown has been good in every game! 2 more wins 🤞
Still size matters in Basketball. That lineup of Smart, JB, JT, Al, Rob was too big and strong against the W's death lineup.
Watching this series celtics are the better team but can they limit their turnovers to win  it all
Game 7 incoming!
Celtics for the win... 🏆....
REF ARE THE REAL HIGHLIGHT IN GAME 3.
At what point does the coach say when your down, No more 3s unless your wide open or where up by 10.
Please please start stepping up off those Klay and Curry screens. Thats literally the only issue I saw this game. Horford needs to step on those threes. Their offense and total defense held off that third quarter bomb Golden State drops every game but they cant be giving Curry and Klay even an inch off those picks. If the guy defending is going under, the big man has to step up and get close. Ill live with Curry or Klay driving in. The Celtics rotations, recovery and switches are more than good enough to make them driving a better option than the open threes.
Damn 70% had warriors in game 3 👀
Draymond was trash 🗑 in this game
Game 2 the Dubs got the home cooking, this time it was the Celtics, hope now the games will be called evenly. Poole looked shook out there, hope the Warriors don’t make the mistake of overpaying him. Draymond is useless if his fake ball hand off drive isn’t working, which is a simple fix defensively. Dude handicaps the offense to play 4 on 5. Wiggins and Klay did what they could, but the offense looked horrible today, with no spacing, no flow, and too many rushed shots. Steph needs help, he was exhausted by the 4th. Celtics looking stronger at this point.
That’s first statement from Mike was wrong lol
Robert Williams HALIMAW
I still feel like the warriors are still gonna win this series
Wiggins showing his true colors this Game shows he is a bust, always was always will be
Celtics not getting PUNKED. Celtics Win Game 4 on Friday and it’s over for the Warriors
Go Boston.
so much incconsistince on the warriors like pool we was up 12 we didnt really need those two pool 3s going 2 for 2 but when we losing and your come in about that same time you go 0 for 3 we rather you score those quick deep 3 this game than when we were already winning and the splash brother score 25 in 3rd and 2 points in 4th know i understand they needed more player to contribute but theres no way i especting my team to win if somebody told me they only scoring a comind of 2 points in the quater that madders this game made me wonder what would have kyrie and lebron done ifthey were in the same situation and warriors need to have the person guarding willaims to double team tatum like the person leave wiggins to double team curry because wiggins cant shoot and game 4 start porter because he can shoot better than wiggins he the best rebound on are team when you do hieght for hieght he has better hussle than anybody on are team and he never quit on a play
Suffocating defense by the Celtics tonight! Just need to not let Curry get those easy looks and we’ll be good!
IF celtics go on to WIN in the series, Jaylen Brown is the Finals MVP
This shows the length advantage of the Celtics another 3rd quarter barrage by the warriors but the 4th quarter hunts them twice now
warriors played like sht tonight. but still dubs in 6
Either team Can win this finals.. Game 7 will be lit.
What the? Heat is better than gsw?
Draymond- winning game 2 means we're in control now!  Finishes with more fouls then points. The biggest bum in the NBA talks like he's kobe
A healthy Clippers would be a better matchup for the Celtics
Tatum bakaw
I can't imagine Boston losing two in a row. Series was over after game 1
I think Draymond got caught up in all the publicity he was getting from game 2. His stats for the first 12 minutes he played- 0 points, 0 rebounds, 0 assists!
Good game but please let's get rid of the 3. Every play there are 3 to 4 players standing put at the 3 point line. Little to no movement, catch and shoot bball. Exciting cause it's a plus one, but that about it
Curry got abused and picked on. Too small. :D
If I could watch a fucking video without 50 fucking ads interrupting that’d be great!!!!🖕🏻🖕🏻
The real warriors here are the Celtics.
Boston has done a great job of shutting down the “others” for GS this series. On the other hand Boston’s role players have come through huge. That’s really why they’re ahead 2-1.
This series is already over after this win..Warriors don't have a legit center they needed against the celts, Draymond dont know how to score in the offensive end so its 4vs5,..Poole is a liability in a defensive end, Klay is Klay and Curry is Curry, all in all, Celtics is dominant both offense and defense...Good Job Celtics for winning the 2022 Championship....Jaylen Brown Finals MVP.
Mr Triple Single had a quadruple single tonight and somehow got all the media attention. Un fucking real.
Seems like the Celtics saw draymond podcast
National media is talking up Tatum as a superstar and, if the Celtics win, the finals MVP. He is the team’s best player, but he’s not had a great series or playoffs in general, and I don’t think he’s quite a superstar. His shooting % is pretty bad. But he does other things, and this shows how he’s matured as a player. In my view, Horford has been just as valuable, if not more so, and much the same is true of Brown and Smart. Most of all, the Celtics are a very good *team*. There are some games to go, and the Ws could win it, but if the Cs win, I’d love to see Horford or Brown get MVP. Not gonna happen, though, because the media has already decided the MVP will be Curry or Tatum, period.
Warriors are paying the price for being careless in game 2
Curry was Exposed on his Defense,, Tatum Just Killed Them in the 4rth...
Golden State Warriors,At the end of the day You know that these Celtic boys were going to Ball@there home Court, But still We (Golden State Warriors) have to Win, you guys have the ability to just Ball outta control no matter where you guys play just Ball 🏀 Let's go Golden State Warriors, You can do it!!
Warriors don’t have tha same fire power to over come that late deficient I feel like yes they have steph buh every team has a star now
I still believe at my warriors, but little mistakes like turnovers and the lack defensive end has to stop, warriors needs to help curry by getting more open shots for him and just overall hit open shots
Trade Daymond Green to the LAKERS so him and Westbrook can enjoy being BUMS together and they can enjoy his podcast explaining to the world how to blow a game Smh 🤔
Let's go Boston
Keep up the talk Dreymond. See where it lands your dumbass

Warriors in 5   _💀_ _☠️_
They have to sit Draybum.
Arrogant curry has no defense. Very soft player. That's why every play they want to curry guard them.
If the Warriors fall to 1-3 in Finals series without Durant (& that Cavs team was way short handed), we might have to acknowledge they needed KD as badly as he needed them.
Referees have to stop interfering with games bruh let em play to many one sided calls for Boston against the Warriors when Boston is known for being Physical.
THIS PROVES SPLASH BROTHERS IS BETTER ONLY WITH THREE POINT THEY CANT SCORE IN THR PAINT LOL
As a dubs fan it's so frustrating to see them get outrebounded and get pounded on the paint, something they were doing well all playoffs long, must win game 4 this might go to 7 let's go!
WOW WHAT A PERFORMANCE Both teams playing there hearts out the best so far from the series HAPPY for CELTICS win 🔥🏀🔥
5:10 What the heck were the Warriors doing? Sleeping? They didn’t even know the ball was play
Without kevin durant warriors are not that good. Cleveland should have 2 rings 2015 and 2016 but kyrie and love were injured
Everyone knows,The early  games  is for the money.Back and Forth,Back  and Forth.
these highlights are a joke lol too quickly cut and 8 ads in a 7 minute video
Horfords intentional injury to curry. 🤦‍♂️that’s why Celtics won.
Warriors fans crying rn
The donkey pack hits different 🚬🐎
Warriors have no defense in the paint, Celtics in 5
Go anyone but the warri--  I mean goo Celtics!
And that’s how you show dominates at home
Flight
Dang great game by both teams but Boston got the better of it even with the great 3rd qrtr for gsw. Good game
Celtics are a hybrid between small ball while still playing their bigs and banging down low. Small ball 2.0. Move over Golden State. Your run was nice while it lasted… but the game will keep evolving.
They swept KD Kyrie..defeated Def Champs Bucks in 7,,beat #1 seed Heat at home in 7...there's no way they can't beat this trigger happy Warriors..Congrats Boston in advance
This series goes to 7
Hate it how Pool is On and Off 🤦🏻‍♂️
Triple Single HOF-er Green at it again... LMAO...
Thanks donkey green for being so effecient in defensive end. . People who is saying this is new rodman is bullshit. This idiiot cant even predic enemies transition
8:46
Celtics did their thang tonight. I don't know why the fuck Kerr keeps trying to work zone defense against this Boston Team....
Tatum baby🔥
Finally, Tatum drives to finish, get fouled or kick. Brown and others look to shoot. Not Tatum going Iso, or pull-ups and Smart 3's.. About damn time. If they are going to win, Tatum needs to continue to drive and Brown shoot that ball.
Jaylen browns defense in the 4th quarter, with that pressure and block on Klay, man this dude is turning into a well rounded 2-way player
Go Bos
Horford dirty, tried to permanently take out Curry twice.
Why the defense it's not like that hard
Celtics are a good and dangerous team with great players
Draymond with a 22-2-4-3  22 fouls 2 points 4 rebounds 3 assits
Dear Celtics dont read any of these positive compliments  Read all the shit talking after game 2  Stephen Smith said ya cant play 2 great games in a row
When the warriors play their best basketball and not lazy bs for major parts of the game. Almost seeming like an unearned sense of arrogance. Like they can just win whenever. Thats when the Celtics will get my full respect as a team. Until then im just gonna keep shitting on the warriors and saying its their fault. I honestly believe they still dont take the Celtics seriously. Which i dont understand bcuz its come to bite them in the ass 2 games now. If they lose this finals i honestly will probably stop being a warriors fan. If you lose giving everything you have and just get out played then so be it, but this is some bs. The Celtics are a good team, but they aren't better than the warriors in my opinion. If the warriors are going to keep taking them lightly, then by all mean Celtics beat the living shit out of them. Embarrass them up and down the court. This kinda bs they deserve it. You think they would have learned after the 2016 embarrassment. Yet here they are losing a finals they shouldn't even be losing
GO CELTICS
CELTICS IN 6!
Steph had 4 fouls, Wiggins has 4 fouls and draymond fouls out. Steph shoots 1 free throw the entire game and was fouled constantly. Garbage! One if the most 1 sided officiated game I've seen in years.
Smart aggressive offensively is one of reason they won, tatum play like he is in 4th quarter hope he continue like that rest of games, celtic whole team afford is good
Nice job Celtics ☘️☘️
I thought steph didn't need KD😂
Celtics also did a good job of keeping their TOs down. They only had 12 TOs tonight. In contrast, Golden State turned it over 17 times. That's why Boston won the game. They kept their TOs low and they outrebounded Golden State.
Cry all ESPN analysts!
Held warriors to 11 in the 4th. Crazy defense
Bos in 5
Celtics beat the nets just keep that in mind
Boston in 6
this is a quality finals, finally it's getting goodddd. hope this series would go to wire.
Can't wait for the Warriors to lose this chip... and we can kill a lot of noise....
Dray with the game of his career lmao dudes all talk soft af
4:41 Lol I like how he included the missed layup by Draymond
Now the game one was not a fluke!  Boston played terrible in game two!  Now in game three they outclassed my Chokerriors!  Time to realized my Chokerriors has no chance to win a title!
Typical Curry 4th quarter.
This is a duckin joke, u lose to the bench gs two games now! Start fuckin Jordan Poole over Klay before you ruin Curry
The amount of curry haters in this comment section 💀💀💀 curry not the only one on the team 💀💀
celtics will win the championship this year because they want it more, they are playing better in every aspect of the game.
Fuck the celtics
number 8 on the warriors lol
statement win by the celts
Ime Udoka to JT, I'll buy you a beer. Don't tell the guys. 😁
It’s beginning to look like the best finals since 2016
maybe Boston will become a champion as rumor said  that who won in the 3rd game will become a champion
But but… stuff coowy is da best?
can’t wait to see @notyouraverageflights reaction 😂😂😂
Those ECF teams are more bigger & defensive / physically. The Celtics are a example of this . Warriors have not really played anyone with that caliber type of basketball.
can't wait for the gsw in 4.. no wait 5.. no wait gsw in 6 now
Im not understanding why the only person who gets you double digit rebounds in on the bench the entire game(Looney)
Storylines all year long is how certain teams are bigger, stronger & more athletic then the Dubs, those media figureheads rarely speak on the players & coaching staff IQ/EQ, which they all possess at the highest level, game3 was simply the C's players & staff out willing, more ingame prepared, 1st to the loose balls & outrebounding  the warriors on the offensive end & doubled the Warriors scoring output, far as points in the paint, applaud the Celtics, just wanna see the Dubs players & staff put together complete game efforts from start to finish like they capable of during these next 3-4 finals games
Guess what? I'm pissed off in 2 days again for this. Just win on game 4 or else we losing hope🤦🏻‍♂️. (I wish we had Robert Williams type of player)
Lfg Celtics💪🍀
Steve kerrr suckssss with his rotation. Boi smoking too much weed
The dynasty died tonight.
I love warriors losing games🤣🤣🤣
Total collapse again in the 4th... hard to watch.
That being said Warriors in 6
At the rate things are going, the Celtics are leading towards winning this series. Look at how each team wins alternately. Boston is bound to get the job done in 7, at least when considering the current trend.  Warrior's slogan this year, 'gold-blooded'—which is adapted from the adjective word, 'cold-blooded'—doesn't resonate with me.  Contrary to their messaging, they seem so emotional and as I said earlier, they tend to get so highly attached to the fruits of their performances which leads to complacence and lack of clemency in their game, defying the true essence of being 'cold-blooded'.  If they really are looking to win this, they gotta start reframing their mindset. Mindset ba.  I now reject the hopes of many that it'll be Warriors in 6. Should they win, it's gon be in 7. And if Jason Tatum and Co. continue to terrorize the defense of the Warriors, as is the case in today's game, they are clearly on their way to clinching their first championship in 14 years.
Great game love to see it, smart hitting big 3s, JB is a becoming the star he is, my dubs gotta run more plays on offense.
Jaylen Brown is stepping up big time.
i was there we kicked ass  tonight baby go celtics TWO MORE ✌️✅
Boston in six..been saying it since last round.
Robert Freaking Williams
Tatum has to stop settling for jumpers when curry is guarding him
#NoKDNoRing
Scott foster masterclass
The difference in the game was the rebounding. Celtics outrebounded the Warriors 47-37.
I love it i thought they will blew this big lead but they managed to get this done ✅👍 good job great defense lets bring the 18 banner back to the garden 2 wins away.... Im a laker fan but this finals im with the celtics
Another Ime Udoka and the Celtic lads' masterclass. He is doing a great job conditioning preparing the players, keeping their composure in check leading to surviving the scorching 3rd period run by the splash brothers and company.
Wiggins needs to go if he wasn’t going 1 for 10 every game gsw would actually win
Mike breen welcome back
WE WANT WISEMAN, Man gsw so small...
I dislike that they never show the block/deflections (they did 1 of Brown's) Williams had a lot, and some good ones that sure should've been highlight. Hope Celtics keep the momentum and win the next one
Warriors has to win game 4. Otherwise, it's over for them.
Geez, al hordford defense on the pick n roll is awful !
Celtics Pride
Green what a clown for fouling out
Warriors are ass
Fucking dirty celtics.
I TOLD Y'all Haters Warriors never played a complete team only bums. Celtics is a real team. and Y'all Haters we're doubting them. they got violated so bad Warriors ain't winning this and draybum is overrated
Ain’t no way the warriors beating this Celtics team 4 times
35 min. 4 rebs 3 assists 2 points for the most over rated player in the NBA. Guess who's stats are these?
What a game for celtics!!
Curry and klay are the only ones that lifted the team others didnt even help that much
First year head coach. That’s crazy to me 🤯💪🏾
You know in the history of Basketball, the homecourt you dont ever wanted to be is Boston. The deadliest and most fighting spirit team’s homecourt.   Im proud for Hoford giving justice
Warriors winning the title in 7 🏆
What i think is going to happen in this series is memory lane 2015 nba finals compared to and 2016 finals they play just like the cavs at its finest
Two wins away from the title🔥🔥🔥👀👀👀 it’s been too long since 2010 we were in the Finals…it’s time to regain that Championship. Come back home and close it out in game 6.
Congratulations to the Boston Celtics for winning 💲💲👏💚🤍😀🏀 Let's go Boston!!!
Fuck the warriors they’re trash
Honestly if the Celtics keep playing this tough and continue to cut down on those turnovers. They have a chance to win game 4; possibly the series.
This is what happens when you got mickey mouse rings 😅
This is unbelievable! The celtics might win a championship this year, if they gonna keep playing like hell!
Warroirs in 5
What was this bruh? Warriors is not a one man team looks like curry only that plays like he cares about that dynasty cuz man they better level up or its gonna bite  their backs hard
Robert Williams played huge minutes for the Celtics tonight.
Marcus Smart was CRITICAL man.
Dubs might lose this finals.. but as a fan of them, i might settle and be happy that there'll be one last game maybe at chase..  🙂
steve kerr sold the game the moment he took curry out in the 3rd and when he had klay on bench in beginning of 4th smh
My Celtics exposed that overrated bum Draymond.🙏🙏
What happened to defense? Did I miss something?
Celtics was not playing 🤣
Where's the Warriors in 5 people at? 😂✌
For me its only 1 game away. Once Celtics win game 4 its all over now for the warriors.
Robert Williams is one hell of an underrated player.
That whole defensive play Brown on Klay just showed how much Klay has lost a step, he looked slow
From the 8 minute mark til the end of the game the warriors scored SIX POINTS TOTAL
If they won’t hustle the ball or rebound then they don’t deserve the trophy
I'll give curry 3 more years before he retirees
Celtics when playing well seem like clearly the better team. Warriors fans can take comfort in Klay heating up and Steph continuing to seem unstoppable with his most efficient outing yet.
The Celtics need to win game 4 because if they don’t I don’t think they will win this series. I’m going for the Celtics in 6 if they win game 4 I’ll be happy, if they lose then Celtics fans better be worried.
I like this Celtics squad. So much confidence! The warriors are talented and can bounce back, but there's a reason why they got KD a few years ago: they need a perimeter striker, who can also get to the rim. This 3 points game has its limits. Hope the Celtics win the series! If this happens, that will be the end of the dynasty for sure, but at this stage, anything is possible
Draymond playing with that Donkey IQ out there.
No score in da second half?  U gotta do better NBA edit guy
jaylen brown coming for that FMVP
Y'all weren't here when celtics lost game 2 and now y'all back 💀💀 if they lose game 4 y'all gonna be quiet again 💀💀
JB will be the FMVP
Warriors vs refs
IT GETS AWFULLY QUITE WHEN THE LARRIORS LOSE.
GREG POPOVISH  DEFENSE  WINS CHIPS!!! GO BOSTON
Dub Fans Right now Try To check the ring if the height is right hahaha and said it was cheated
Congrats Celtics
If they could keep the core young players, celtics will be a force in the east for years to come
Steff Curry is and amazing shooter.    he also cant guard a wet paper sack.  he got fucking abused on the defensive end.
vampire green. Totally useless.  No rebounds, no points, all turnovers. Only mouth left can work.  Guess Celtics in 6 or 7 if Green still played like this, though I am warriors fan.  Damn
Absolutely astonishing game!! Can’t wait for game 4 the energy in that building is going to be absurd.
HA HA HA!!!! I hope the Celtics win the championship! Screw you Warriors fans!!!!! LOL
udoka doesn't like pritchard for some reason.  he gives him inconsistent minutes, yanks him out because of a short leash, and tries to embarrass him from that.  hoepfully not because he's white from the portland area.  he wouldn't dare do that if pritchard was his race from there
PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS  Celtics win game 1 Warriors win game 2 Celtics win game 3 Celtics win game 4 Warriors win game 5 Celtics win game 6 and the finals
Pritchard is the Key
Horford really stepped up this game! All the way to Curry's ankles!
Celtics are younger bigger more tall and stronger. Warriors are beatable.
Jaylen Brown: 27pts 9 Rebs 5 Asts 1 Block
Call travels.
Jayson Tatum will have a better GOAT argument than Luka by time he retires
GSW in 6, don’t argue
11 point 4th really hurt the warriors, they really gotta be able to close
Intense game ..
every time i came down to watch my C's they couldnt make a shot and turned the ball over every time and the warriors made the easiest shots of their lives and when that happened a second time tonight i just stopped watching.     so basically i was the mvp of this game, i'd like my 500k bonus please
☘️🏆
5:10 al mvp for this
Lets Go Boston 2-1 series ill take it Shoutout from santa barbara
Basketball 🏀💗
Ok warriors. Get in da game pls. U got this
Hahaha💪👍
Zaza comeback, injure someone. (It is a joke don't take it seriously)
AMAZING GAME BY THE BOSTON CELTICS, GOOD TEAMWORK AND GREAT DEFENSE. GO GO CELTICS......
Play kuminga draymond 2 pts 4 rebounds 3 assists nd he a a hall of famer? Wtf he been doin these stats for years.
Marcus Smart: 25pts 7 Rebs 5 Asts
Wow..what a series...i think Game 6 will be a deciding game😅
gm1 C gm2 W gm3 C gm4 W gm5 W gm6 C gm7 W
Mr. Triple Single is all hot air. Dude got torched.
that was some good basketball
thats exactly what Boston needed I said last game they needed to get everything that happened in game 2 out of their head or they'll be in trouble and they played great calm, poised and focused. glad it wasn't a blowout, blowout games are usually bad the following game for the winning team. they need to carry the way they played tonight over to next game cuz the warriors will be coming back swinging, gotta stop steph and klay klay starting to find his rhythm not often they lose when they both score 20+ each. Let's go Celtics 🍀
The shots missed by the warriors team, the turnovers really gave away the match. Credit to Boston to play a elite basketball  Curry played at his best today, Thompson improved. Rest of the team should have played better.
Kerr takes curry out when his hot and lets him cool off. Lmao makes no sense…..
Don't get drifted from the fact that Draymond had 6 fouls, 2 points, 4 rbs & 3 assists in 35 mins of talking to no one
Jaylen Brown went crazy
Jayson Tatum FMVP favorite after this game💯💯
Warriors fan claiming their team has dominated all but the 4th quarter this series. This game shows that the only quarter the Warriors have dominated is the 3rd quarters only.
Damn, what a game. Both teams are so fun to watch. I don't even know who's winning the chip anymore.
let's go! #Celtics #Warriors
Another Draymond superb game! Fun times ahead!
Warriors 🧹 or warriors in 5 is out the window... respect to these tough Celtics
Curry got exposed on defensive end, they will need to start helping him.
Jaylen was ballin tonight but my lawd work on that handle and FT percentage young blood youd be unstoppable…
Magic rigged it again. Celtics from 11minutes in the 4th magnetized ball again. the numbers for this series just keep going down and down in terms of viewership. It's not going to get better when you rig the game folks.. Game 1 it was 2nd and 4th qtr. Game 2 2nd qtr and game 3 4th qtr.
Great job Boston great players let us not forget the COACH of this team doing an amazing job...
Nice1 boston
Every one talk that warrior shit now what where  you at imao
Draymond green cant even compare to Smart. Love gs to win it, Steph specifically. But damn I hate Draymond. He's like Udonis Haslem with minutes played. Congrats Celtics since you beat my Bucks you better win this all.
Just start imagining the Celtics raising the championship over these dubs 🤣 4-1 C's. It's OVER
This is a weird series refs giving the Celtics every ticky tac call
Green wanted to play physical and he got what he wanted. Let's go and snatch that game four!!!
Jayson Tatum: 26pts 6 Rebs 9 Asts 1 Steal
Draymond Green is playing so poorly in this series, the Celtics fans should hope he doesn't get a tech and ejected.
Wow Boston started cheering when Curry got hurt no disrespect but Wow imagine Jayson Tatum got injured and warriors started tearing and someone was encouraging it to not trying to say his name but that is kind of messed up
Celtics need to stop trying to get Tatum going when they have the lead. JB had the hot hand.  JB IS The MVP so far. Tatum is trying to hard to be the MVP just keep the ball moving. GO CELTICS IN SIX!!!!!!
Curry needs to stop kicking his legs out trying to draw a foul. That stuff is beneath him imo.
I been saying this, everytime jordan poole stands out in a game best believe a subpar game is coming and draymond was such a liability on the court tonight, absolute fucking garbage from the biggest shit talker in the league more fouls than points but he got the nerve to talk down on anyone hes making a bag and hes barely playing in crunch time thats a damn shame
Green needs to change his attitude towards the game. He's affecting the whole team. Credits to Rob Williams though great defensive performance.
2 Words......Game Seven
that atmosphere was insane
This loss is on Steve Kerr tonight. He failed to make proper adjustments and make timeouts when things were getting out of hand. Looney played 17 god damn min!! Why!? He had 7 reb in the time he played! I dont even recall seeing the death lineup out there once over the course of these three games. Like wtf kerr.
Yesssss
Williams repeatedly embarrassed Draymond
The Celtics Defense killed the warriors.
For those guys who is still rooting for warriors to win this series.  Come think of it that this game shows who is winning the series curry and klay shoots pretty well on this game. but this celtic team has fantastic defense. And not everyone can climb a tall wall.
BIG difference when you play the C's IN BOSTON.  The Fans at full throat less than 2 minutes in.  Hard to win in that Building.
refball
😡😡😡😡😡😡
Draymond green: Turnovers: 2 Points : 2 Rebounds : 4  Fouls: 6 Unnecessary shouting : 100%  He should spend less time in the media and work more on his game. He doesn't defend the best player, can't take rebounds, can't score, can't stop big guys in the paint, causes turnovers, commits fouls, screams unnecessarily.  Why is he in the team?  People and media will continue to defend him and blame either Klay, Steph, Poole, or Wiggins.
GO BOSTON CELTICS  SHUT DOWN  THE WARRIORS  LOCK THEM UP
THAT BOY "SCOTT FOSTER" aka SCUM WAS  THE MVP IN THIS GAME!!!!!!!
Klay and Steph played well tonight, but the Warriors defense didn't show up tonight.
Dreymond Green is trash. Many years in the nba but no improvement.
Tatum, Brown & Smart were all exceptional. That’s what it’s gonna take to beat the Warriors when Steph & Klay shoot like they did!
C’mon Draymond Strike us another Superman pose  Lol
Marcus Smart got away with more this game than what everyone accused Draymond last game. He's a perpetual foul.
Warriors are weakening in scores 108, 107 and 100pts💪💪💪
👏👏 BOSTON
The Celtics gave it all and they can really take this series along with game 4, if you watched this game live then you know Curry got hurt and I think that’s gonna stop him a little bit but now that much so Celtics in 6!
Golden State in 7 or Boston in 6
That's what championship basketball looks like!
Don't wanna meet us next year? How did that end up for you 🤣😂.
cant wait for flight reaction😂
Warriors are now 2-9 in their last 11 Finals games without Kevin Durant.  👀
Easily the best performance of the finals. Steph and Klay went off , Dubs had their big third quarter, and the Cs still win by 16
People keep trying to predict this series "Warriors in 6", "Warriors in 7". They never learn, this is the finals, and players will compete their hardest here.
This is all over golden state is going to lose guaranteed and Green is going to be the cause of it if Golden State wants to win they would have to have a starting lineup that consists of Stephen Curry Jordan Poole Klay Thompson Andrew Wiggins and Looney if that's not the starting lineup Golden State doesn't stand a chance
Draymond is literally a liability on offense
As a lifetime celtics fan i love that draymond is bringing some real hatred to this series. Exactly what this matchup needed
Can't wait skip n Shannon in the morning
Boston wins.. Yeah baby... 😂 ✌️
Celtics need to win Game 4 on Friday. It’s a must win game before they head back to Crooked Woke Cali.
Golden State has had their run.   It’s Boston’s time now. They have a great team.   It’s very unlikely Golden State wins two in a row in this series - which is the only way they’ll be able to win.
Jt took over in the 4th   Like a general
Useless Warriors players list; Green, Poole, Payton. Anyone else I missed out?
The Celtics out rebounding the warriors and the points in the paint made the difference.
Celtics locking it down
First half from Celtics was gift to watch. They came loaded heavy and unload on warriors.
Very weak interior defense of warriors looney wasn't use in 4th quarter they didn't use bjelica at all. They did small ball most of the game cause they were pressured by Boston's offense. Small ball good offense but weak defense. Unlike game 2 they balance it with presence of either looney or bjelica. Wasted bounce back of Klay, I saw the adjustment of Boston on curry's pick and roll 3 but it wasn't consistent only for the first Q. But curry still got his rhythm cause he's a God of transition 3's.
I've said it before and imma say it again. No matter how many points Steph and Klay make, if no one's gonna step up defensively and maybe offensively I don't see the Warriors winning the Finals
Damn i hope Robert Williams can stay healthy! He is very valuable to this team.
Boston is champion for sure!!!
What obscene name did Celtic fans call draymond green???
I think this is one of the best nba finals series ive seen in a while
The C's wanted it more and just destroyed the Warriors in the 4th. Love to see it as a Celtics fan. 2 more to Banner 18.
Celtics are now 13-0 in the playoffs this year with Scott Foster as Head Ref
@flight23white
Steph with ANOTHER disappearance  in the 4th....... These games starting to pile up a bit 👀
JAMES  HARDEN  IS DONE😆
I can totally see warriors ain't winning this series
It's okay... this is the last time the Celtics will make it to the finals with this team.
🍀
Draymond is trash. And that's coming from a warriors fan. I hope he gets suspended for the rest of the series. He plays with his mouth!
GSW has no chance to win the NBA Finals. 4-1
Celtics got this in G5💪💪💪
Amazing game and draymond greens always talks shit but every game 2 points 4 or max 10 lol what a shame .
Steph will choke in the finals... He always does and will repeat again.... Steph choke... Its the end.... Celtics winning... Warriors aint winning... Its all about role players in this final games..and celtics have way better role players than thr current warriors roster
Best game of Rob Williams life tonight.  And i quote the Garden crowd " FUCK YOU DRAYMOND!! FUCK YOU DRAYMOND!!!"
Kerr is one of the main reasons for this loss. Taking out Steph Curry in the third quarter when he is scorching hot. This is the finals not a preseason game.
gsw letting celtics to a 2nd chance point
Great bounce back game! Almost everyone in the starting line up played great (although Al could've been better) but man what is about third quarters that leads to mental brain farts? And what was with all the drop coverage on Steph Curry which always is a mistake to use on him? Just don't do that and keep the turnovers down low and we'll be good the rest of the way
The Boston Celtics this time figured out how to survive the Warriors 3rd quarter onslaught to clutch it up in the 4th quarter.   I desperately want this series to go six seven games long for the entertainment.
Celtics got this series in the bag if they learn to not turn over the ball a million times
Tatum 26 PTS. 10 asts. Mvp
Great win by Scott Foster and the Celtics. The Finals will end with Warriors winning in 6 games 4-2. Curry gets his deserving (since 2015) Finals MVP. I say it, and y’all better believe it.
Curry asking Draymond to call another Superstar in the parking lot after this series 👀  🗣 Curry can’t carry! Haven’t had a significant or Legacy game in the playoffs despite having 3 rings 👎 KLAY BETTER
Bruh curry keeps disapearing in the 4th like damn can he be clutch for once, he aint winning no fmvp if he dont play good in the 4th🤦‍♂️
Mf Green bout to get trade
Al horford fat ass trynna hurt curry all game
Dramond with the quadruple single. 👏👏👏
Brown for FMVP!!!
Nice
Boston fans won't talk about refs this game huh. Lol last game Grant Williams got called for cheap calls. While they call cheap calls on steph. There's a difference
The same result in game1. 3rd Quarter as always the Warriors stronger Quarter. And in the 4th the Celtics reign it again.
Steve kerr always benching curry when he is hot😡😡😡 stupid steve
The Celtics better pray they win the series because I guarantee you if theses guys lose they won’t ever get back to this position again, maybe ever, but I believe the warriors come out on top.
Man draymond is such a good player. He had more fouls than points. But that wasn't hard when he only scored 2 points. Pathetic for a guy who talks so much shit. He gets a foul and is allowed to argue for 5 minutes. Why?
I don't want to see Green 2 pts. playing in the finals again. Curry played magnificent but Green sold the game with his non-existent scoring. Curry will be called choker cuz of his stupidity.
Shout out to all 8 Celtics players on the court that made this happen! And shout out to all the players that sinked in the free throws. 🧲🧲🧲🧲🧲🧲🧲⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
Im really sick of steve kerr  style benching the player that is starting to gets hot...
As a Celtics fan, the referees helped us win game 3.
Robert Williams is so slept on... he is great for the Celtics defense. If he got more clock he'd for sure be 1st defensive team.
I don't know but, this finals look like everything is payed 4 the Celtics win or at least 2 take the finals 2 7 games. Warriors R playing 2 lazy 😪👎🏼
Can't wait for flight to react!!!
Congratulations NBA Champions the Boston Celtics
Celtics in 5
The Celtics should know by now that they can't afford to give the 3rd quarter to the Warriors. They are always outscored in the 3rd!
Warriors role players haven't stepped up. Jordan Poole looked like a deer in headlights
Celtics fight the refs every game.
Celtics Pride!!!
I have a feeling this is gonna be a back and forth series. Whatever team doesn't come out more aggressive but finishes more dominant will win that game
Draymond Green with another Triple Single
The Celtics are figuring out the warriors and guarding curry a lot better curry shot 1/4 in the 4th and had 3TO I like how they neutralized steph and klay in the 4th actually C’s in 6 ☘️☘️
WARRIORS in 6
7 games! 7 Games! PLEASE I have nothing to do this June! 😁
4-1 I’m calling it now Boston!!
GSW IS CRYING
The offensive boards and soft defense early on is what ultimately killed the warriors. Great game by the Celtics, took advantage of the undersized dubs. I’d love to see kuminga get some minutes to match some of the athleticism the Celtics. Go warriors!
If I mean IF the Celtics can clean up their 3rd... 🤯
STEPH CURRY AND DRAYMOND THE WARRIORS  GOT PUNKED!!!!GO BOSTON CELTICS
Warriors are the greatest mickey mouse team of all time
Golden state is to old
Warriors fans thought this series was going to be easy after beating 3 teams that had injuries to their best/second best players. Talk about delusion. I called whoever wins that Milwaukee/Boston series will be the champions and I stick by that. Milwaukee vs Boston was the REAL finals.
Draymond Green is so overrated. The Warriors lost because of him. His defense is overrated and his offense is pathetic. How many times did this dude get out rebounded??? Every time the Warriors were about to go on a run, Draymond would make a careless turnover or commit an unnecessary foul. Credit to the Celtics for a great game, but Draymond is horrible.
If the celtics take game 4 the series is over but I'm not counting on it. The warriors will make adjustments.
Game 4: Warriors  Game 5: Celtics  Game 6: Warriors  Game 7: Warriors   Warriors in 7! Mark my words, you can come back here at your convenience!
Should’ve been a jump ball when curry dove for the ball or at least Steve Kerr could have challenged it
Underneath my nails , and blood will dry , you “can’t” doubt , you “can’t” hate , no matter what you got , I’m …… what if jake Paul want to kiss Lebron i don’t care just want james to carry up dis team join build up shoot the points bring more titles to “Fremont’s state”.
Time Lord giving it all and playing some inspiring ball considering his health!   He was the difference maker with his shot blocking, aggressiveness on the boards, and hustle plays for 50/50 balls
boston in 5 baby
Fuck golden state good win Celtics !
Dwarfs vs Boston Celtics 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well YouTube golden state warriors got toowork  a little more harder  if they wanted a championship at home let go warriors go
These stupid refs are getting paid so the trash Celtics can win
CONGRATULATIONS to the entire CELTICS team! The calm COACH must also be CONGRATULATED. I have very little to say, but this: KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! However, please, make an effort to MAINTAIN your LEAD.
If Boston Celtics win this series and I know they will, Jaylen Brown should be the FMVP no doubt about that.
The Celtics came back to their home court and took advantage of it. It's simple, Golden State is weak on rebounding. Great game from Grant, Al, and Rob for fighting for those offensive rebounds. Also, the defense wasn't there, especially when Brown went of in the 1st quarter. They did better in the 3rd quarter. Tatum finally understood to try finishing instead of trying to draw fouls. But, their big were selling(Horford). He needs to come up when they set screens for Curry or Klay. Hope Steph's alright.
Warriors coaching was dumb! 2.5 minutes 3rd quarter, Warriors up by a point then took out curry. Momentum changed! Coaching should have finished the 3rd quarter with Curry going crazy. BAD warriors coaching! BAD! Warriors can't rebound and the Celtics team are way better 3 pointers! Klay, you suck! Green, you can't shoot! Warriors played like AMATEURS! Embarrassing loss!
Jaylen Brown’s stat line: 27 points 9 rebounds 5 assists 1 block
It was so nice to see the crying warriors fans in the live scoreboard
Watch how everyone finna say celtics in 6 after this
Celtics fans are amazing. 16 points up but nobody wants to leave the garden until the game clock turned to zero.
Trade wiggins garbage
Love JT's playmaking.
they should not letting celtic to take open 3 pointer.
Quit fucking taking curry out when he’s hot and he and the warriors are on a roll in the third with what like 3 minutes left or some shit? They took him out and he was hitting it from everywhere… midrange, long range, layups and boom Kerr takes him out until the fourth and they just lost rhythm at that point and was basically over
Boston restaurants have no shortage of salt - Warriors fans' tears have plenty of it!
Traders don’t leave legacies.
As a warriors fan I gotta say if Boston and golden state both play this exact same way the rest of the series Boston will win. They blitzed us early then outfought us at the end. No more excuses Golden State
Jayson Tatum’s stat line: 26 points 6 rebounds 9 assists 1 steal
I’ve been questioning Steve Kerr a lil bit lately cus his rotations and adjustments been suspect
Is brown gonna win FMVP if Boston wins it?
let's just hope the nba doesn't let the warriors win the chip.
Another 4th quarter slump for GSW😩
This is what draymond green wants 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good win Celtics, please continue to humble the so called “mighty warriors”.  They are arrogant and get all cocky when they beat teams like the Nuggets who have 2 of their top 3 players out.  Curry didnt go anywhere last year when his boys were injured…. Next year the Nuggets will spank them at full strength, until then GOOOOOO Celtics!!!!!!
By far the best player on the Celtics is Draymond Green 🍀🍀🍀🍀
As they say,  defense wins Championship and the Celtics is displaying it all season long.. No offense to the Warriors but This is Bostons year I believe.
every time golden state climbs to take the lead the celtics just keep answering back. other than that the warriors got railed from the inside i just cant
I can’t wait to tune into Draymonds Podcast tonight. Man put in that work! 2 points, 3 assists, 4 rebounds! Not to mention all the other things he did that go beyond the stat sheet like barking at the refs and celtics players, and rolling over Jaylen Brown.
Draymond with another triple single
Kerr puting out curry when he's hot. smh
Steph, Wiggins and Klay need to score 30 points each to win this series or else bye bye championship.
Only way warriors will win is if green starts scoring.. it’s so easy to guard this team right now it’s 5 on 4.  Klay stepped up but on defense he’s behind. I want the warriors to win but I don’t see it
Warriors was just struggling to get the rebounds defensively and offensively. Warriors would need some minor adjustments here and there if they want to win this championship.
Who y’all got winning FMVP so far??
Warriors needs extra pockets for back up for title.   We hate you levron, we need you back , back bring us a championship not one but two , more….. traders don’t leave legacies.
Green is what?? Not a all time great
Warriors wasted great 3rd quarter only to not show up for 4th 2nd time in series Warriors could not close out game in 4th taking nothing away from Celtics defense but it's just a case of Warriors playing horrible curry had 3 consecutive turn overs green foul out
Parang matatalo yata pusta ko ah😆
If the dubs will only play great in third quarter alone , this series will be over. They are no match on the physicality of boston. Celts in 5.
If the Celtics win the series they better not snub jaleyn brown for mvp
WAY to go 👑👑💯💯💯
Stephen became a chicken curry bec. couldn't defend!
They almost came back that's some cheese.
Curry 4th quarter: 2 points, 3 turnovers, 1/4 shooting  Greatest 4th quarter choker of all time
Man somebody tell ayesha that JT and JB DONT LIKE MAYO ON THEY SANDWICH
Celtics in 6
Brown showing everyone, green can't stop him.
High key the Warriors need to win the next 2 games to win this series.. my prediction is Boston in 6
Nice game
Warriors will respond
Draymond Green turned darkestgreen🤣🤣🤣 Warriors scoring declining 108-107-100... Celtics bench perimeter defender and scorer did very good job💪💪💪
CURSE YOU CELTICS ☘️👎👎👎👎👎👎
Now ppl know we ain’t no joke CELTICS IN 6🍀🍀✅👏👏
Draymond needs to get it together or its over for the warriors
foul calls in favor of Home team. as always expected Congrats for the W boston. Still far from over bounce back WARRIORS ♥️
Klay needs to show up
Steph continues to let me down in the 4th quarter, when will he be clutch and stop being just a front runner smh, great game by Celtics
Mark Jackson is the aikman/buck of the nba when the warriors are playing.   I cant stand it
The nba isn’t fun to watch anymore - it’s all blowouts - almost like every game is rigged ;)  Let them play real basketball
Draymond is so OVERATTED
The problem for the warriors in this game that they keep missing three pointer and doing bad plays and often turn the ball over, 3rd quarter was their opportunity to comeback well they choked it last quarter. This series is either a turnaround or we’ll just tie it up, feels like we are in a edge right now, Warriors in 7 or Celtics in 6.
Now im looking for those gsw fans who says .  Warrior's in 5 to their home!!!! Gsw fans so arrogant these days!!!!👎👎👎👎👎🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Celtics in 6
no kd no win
Flubber need a T everytime they nosedive to the ground after every 3, holy shit that embarrassing.
Warriors got to give it up move on from draymond green or maybe Klay Thompson 1 of them
Curry lands on al horford foot. Al holford sits on curry's leg. Wiggins being pushed in rebounding and grabbing jerseys. Idk why the celtics complain in game 2 that warriors are dirty because its a blowout, but celtics cams out dirtier in game 3. And a lot of soft calls sht this game. Especially derrick white a lot of flops. 🤡
If the Celtics win this series, I would consider Horford an underrated champion. Imagine sticking up with Lebron's run ever since he returned to cleveland and hoped that teams he went to atleast gain him more playoffs experience finally pays off.
I’m not a big basketball guy but it’s absolutely great to see my regional team finally on top again. (Edit:) congratulations to warriors fans! What a huge disappointment on our end but there will always be another day and other playoff finals eventually
Flight finna be mad asf 😂😂😂😂
Larriors fans deciding weather or not to stay on bandwagon or not LOL
Go for 18th!!!.. Let's go celtics 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀 🍀....
Bruh why the hell i only see celtics fans comment if the celtics won? but if the warriors win i dont see any celtics fans commenting at all 😂
Fyi : Curry and thompson shooting is insane tonight but still boston manage it. thats why still defense wins championship it dowsnt matter you shoot threes all over again
Great game steph.... We will get the game 4
L if you like Draymond F if you dont like Draymond
Draymond literally complains about everything then puts stats up like that. He plays basketball for cardio and nothing else. 😭😭😭
Steph Will never win a Finals MVP
Cmon warriors bounce bacc on Friday if not then they r done 😢 GO warriors
Nice one celtics
Kerr should have gamble the remaining minutes in the 3rd quarter when Steph was torching them. Went cold after that. Still GSW in 7!!
Man, curry has been killing it this series, he's the reason why all the games have been close. We keep screwing up the 4th quarter.
I like how they showed respect for kobe by wearing the black stripe with his number ..Celtics earned this win and eventually the championship 🍀
Yesssirrr finally refs called a good game didn’t allow GS to play football
What an insane game! Draymond found out tonight and the Celtics defense was just too oppressive. Just a battle of deeply talented teams duking it out as every player chips in a bit and it's just a question of which team has a better sum. Gonna be a long series and some really annoying whistles for both sides.
Another disappearing act by Lurry in the 4th
2 more wins for the Celtics to handle Steph Curry’s 1-3 finals record without Durant! Can’t wait!
still warriors in 6!
It still baffles me how Draymond made the All star team
First
GSW literally gave this away their defense is way better
F the BOS
celtics dont win without robert williams... as a bron fan.. go Cs!!!!
LETS GOOOOO CETICS IN 6!!!!!
Their a bunch of bit_ _ _s
Why in world after that first half would you continue play dray at the 5 with r will in game 🤦‍♂️ that and the 4th turnovers cost gs smh
The Warriors complained before the game that the hoop at their end was too high.  They had it measured and they were right 🤔  (via The San Francisco Chronicle) - BF
Nawala yung mayayabang na fans daw kuno ng golden state waterboys hahhahahhahahhaha... Asan na kayo sa game 5 nyo bwahahhahahhahahhaha
2pts for Steph in the 4th quarter?
Gg warriors, once again refs were spotty not as bad as game two or game three of ecf but still could be better. Gotta feel bad for Steph, after leading his team all the way back, he will be fine, he just needs these two days of rest and he should be good to go. I swear if i see anyone calling al falling on his leg dirty, it was a scramble for a loose ball, nothing unnecessary just unfortunate and bad luck. Celtics are so much better when they dont play drop coverage, those are like layups for steph and klay. Gs will bounce back game four most likely, but hoping for another w for my cs. #BleedGreen
celtics are fucked warriors in 6
The Celtics just have to win all their games at home and they're good. I like their odds
Like I’ve said multiple times Celtics in game 6.
Warriors vs refs and themselves
Steve Kerr should put on a Celtics Jersey since he was the best person in Boston tonight in helping their win
ohhhh its a good day to be a leboston lakers supporter hahaha, i just dont like supporting gswd coz they r so good
draymond and adrew need to level up their stats and the role player need to step up. klay need to bring back his nba finals form
Slopy slpoy slopy 4th quarter by the warriors! Its really frustrating to be fan of this team. Steve kerr made a mistake taking out klay thompson early in the last quarter, he was hot.
Look like Celtics was able to expose the smaller Heats & Warriors.  Heats eliminated.  Warriors next?
Two teams that are electric on both ends. This series is an incredible display of basketball, and is a very entertaining matchup.
The 4th-quarter Celtics defeat the 3rd-quarter Warriors for the second time in three games. 3rd-quarter Curry was nowhere to be found in the 4th quarter. But I am mystified that with 2:19 remaining, trailing by 14, Kerr gave up and put in all their subs. WTF?? The series comes down to Game 4. If Boston wins, they will almost certainly win the series.  But if the Warriors win, they will be back in the driver's seat, needing only to win at home (not guaranteed, but it's an advantage). Side note: remember all the games this year with star players going off for 40 or 50?  Not in this series.
Look at Draymond' bum ass out there lmao 2 points,6 fouls😂🤣🍻🍺
Being in Boston is different
Yessir 🍀🍀🍀🍀
Jaylen Brown was ballin once he got it going the whole team started flourishing from it Tatum,Smart and Horford and White
If you can't beat Boston 2 in a row, you're in big trouble... 👀👀👀
Celtics in 5 Letsgo
Celtics in 6 💚
Lol 😂 this would of been a 25+ point win for the Celtics if the refs didn’t give everything to the warriors smh 🤦‍♂️
We have been waiting on Jayson Tatum to be able to close the game out tonight and he did just that. I’ll be curious to see how severe Steph’s leg injury is after diving for the loose ball going into Friday Night. The Warriors have to do a better job of defending the basket and containing dribble penetration
BOSTON CELTICS WINNER GAME 3 OF THE 75TH ANNUAL NBA FINALS
I’m a warriors fan and Scott foster was terrible calling bad fouls on jaylen brown and phantom fouls on steph curry that foul on smart was pussy lvl . And Wiggins is a brick from 3 he needs to stop shooting
Viper Tatum 🐍🐍
What a great game by the Celtics that 3rd quarter shit gotta stop though 😭  Tatum needs to make layups  Brown needs to be more agressive when getting the ball draymond off ball game had him stuck a little bit  Smart just be more consistent  Derrick white make layups Al horford good job on the mis match
Everyone seems to overlook the best player for Boston tonight, Steve Kerr. After Curry has an insane 3rd quarter comeback to take the lead, he decides to rest him and keep his only big man looney out the entire game so Boston could really dominate inside the paint. Steve Kerr Game 3 MVP 😆😆🤣
Lose this one but not finished yet ....but the fact is that Boston looks much better then warriors in the finals series ...hope we comeback in game 4🤞
What Rob Williams does for this team is truly incredible
Celtics bounce back after their turnover problems in game 2, AMAZING!!! I'm pretty amazed for their effort in this game. Warriors need to step up in game 4. I can't believe these 2 teams have not lose b2b times. #NBAFinals
Celtics played all game long, except in the third quarter. If they can play better in the third, the title will be theirs. ☘️
celtics in 5
Another great game tonight by both teams. So exciting to watch! Step Curry and Klay did amazing, but Boston never panicked and made plays after plays. I think warriors will bounce back in game 4. But Boston will eventually wins this series in 6.
Celtics defense is so annoying to watch. Im rooting for the warriors but Celtics defense is very solid and their offense is also solid.
What a great game to have Uncle Mike back😊🍻🍺
Ugh
Respectfully Draymond is an offensive liability. He’s all bark no bite
WHEN SPLASH BROTHERS TURN INTO TRASH BROTHERS.
Jaylen Brown for Finals MVP
Draymond was trash tonight when we needed him to step up especially on the offensive end, no drives to basket, missing open layups, and he then fouls out, he should take his ugly ass back to his hotel room and react to his trash self on his pod cast….
Bro why does it look like Jaylen Brown is the Celtics number option and warriors need to stop giving shooters good space
yo
Let’s see how flight reacts to this one
Why the Warriors lose this game?. Careless turnovers, Kerr with a beautiful coaching like benching players who are red hot like Curry at the end of the third and not willing to do a certain change for example not subbing Kuminga in so Warriors can have more athleticism since Williams is taking over the board. And last these ass refs and that lucky ass bank shot from Smart.
the entire team played well. the JT, JB, MS trio was excellent
I Think if boston ignore draymond antics he will be the most useless warrior player on the court  Tonight dray have quadruple single single 6fl 4asst 3reb  2pts
YOU KNOW WHAT BRICK'S ARE MADE OF? KLAY.....
sheeeeesh
The Celtics can never lose with an aggressive Tatum
Celtics almost blew it.   Warriors in 6.
Stop sleeping on the Celtics . Shut up . And just watch and enjoy the games. 🤫. We don’t care!!! How much you hate the Celtics, ☘️ ☘️. Makes even just THAT MUCH BETTER
Celtics played crazy on the defensive end and the team chemistry is crazy but please warriors fan give credit when it's due Well deserved win Celtics
Dubs in 6 ,let’s be honest Celtics literally best player was the refs, every time warriors were catching up refs would step in and call dumb calls
Draymond Green vs Russell Westbrook in a 3 point shooting contest would be comedy..
celtics in 6 ...book it
Betloblop
Drayton always got something to say. But only 2 points and fouled out. Been carried his whole career.
Celtics have shown again that they can make adjustments and come back from a horrible performance 💯🍀 Celtics in 6
“Draymond got his normal triple single” -Barkley 😂
Saying Curry is Top 10 all-time is a mental illness.
STEPHANIE CURRY IS BUILT LIKE A HONOR ROLL STUDENT.
Celtics in 6
The donkey is back with a triple single 🐎
When did I ask?
Big dubs boys Celtics in 5
Brown and Tatum played a good game. Celtics defense is scary and seem impossible to beat. Warriors didn't play bad but I'm def undecided 💀👀
Celts D and Tatum kicked ass!
Aye man….. Draymond better come with it. I don’t think his teammate or the organization is going to put up with his lack of offensive play much longer. Especially if they lose the finals
Warriors in 7!
Warriors pack🚬
Draymond another triple single 💀 😳 😂
lmfao Draymond is dog shit. Played for 35 minutes and only scored 2 points hahahahahaha
First of all Curry can’t run point, he had like 3 straight turnovers In the 3rd quarter. 2nd Curry ain’t never getting a FMVP.
Celtics were great on both ends, Tatum,Brown, And Smart were really clutch but give RobWill his respect for his amazing shot blocking and hustle. I hope we can survive the greatness of Stephen Curry in the 3rd quarter and hope he's okay. Celtics in 6
Scott Foster is the player of the game !
3rd
Warriors will win, i promise you
There's still game 4.. go warriors...
Warriors lowkey shoulda won this fr
Hello
Thank you, Celtics! Keep it up. Do not let Draymond taste a championship ever again.
3rd
3rd
So good to see Tatum finally attack the rim! I feel like he settles for bad jumpers way too much or is too focused on drawing a foul. Today he meant business. Jaylen being an aggressive scorer early also helps. Go Celtics!
I swear the Warriors in the 4th quarter is an atrocity to watch.
I think Looney needs more minutes. Kerr hasn’t been really good in in game adjustments. I see this going 7 though with a lot a back and forth.
CELTICS IN 6   HEAT FAN HERE 🙌
Gay
Curry is better, Celtics sucks
I watched that whole thing. Pure teamwork
Easy work for Celtics.
thompson was trashhhhh AGAINNN
2nd
