5 years on Oliver is still making mistakes.  Graham right on these refs 5 years ago.  Far to outspoken for SKY who are in bed with Premier League and PGMOL
Sourpuss has room to talk
Watching this again after PGMOL suspended David Coote.
David Coote on VAR that day
This was a mafia hit on VVD. No red card or suspension for x amount of games?🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
If anybody knew the difference it would be Souness, between a heavy tackle and assault.. The assault is intentional
Still now in 2023/24 season the officials reviewing incidents in the VAR studio are still incompetent  and getting decisions wrong.
Souness always tried to hurt people as he is a thug and enjoyed it!
People don’t understand the rules of football of the ball was offside then it wasn’t in play and can’t be a red
never heard such rubbish
Souness made some horrific tackles in his day. Now he’s sitting there talking about assault lol
More importantly though, WHERE THE HELL WAS POGBA
Graeme no sir no
Souness is a tool. Someone should ban him from talking about bad tackles or behaviour in football games..
I nearly broke nanis leg
Is it me , or does Jamie Carragher look like the Predator 😂😂😂😂
Didn’t this guy shake his fist at someone 😭😭😭
So... If a player says "Sorry, I didn't mean to" He should just go unpunished no matter how bad the tackle was?
As Keane said,he wanted to hurt players !!  But injure them ?   No !
It's funny because the fact that Graeme just straight up trying to kill people in his days.
I still say to this day prickford knew what he was doing
i nearly broke nanis leg
"That was an assault". Absolutely agree with that. Jail time would suffice.
Pickford just threw himself towards the ball to block a shot, as a keeper does
Pickford is a joke. I'm pretty sure his wife is using him for his money and sleeping with a real man.
unbelievable tackle !!!
Delaying the offside flag is the problem. The game continues, but they say now whatever happens after the offside does not exist. However, the consequences are real. The play continues. So it must still must have some bearing. I know if it’s handball then the offside takes precedence. But come on. This decision is different. In the players eyes no decision has been made because the flag does not go up straight away. I would rather the lines person or if you prefer assistant referee got a close decision wrong, rather than a player receive no punishment for a tackle like that.
I nearly broke Nani’s leg
I nearly broke Nani's leg
Carragher said 'I don't think anyone goes out to deliberately hurt someone's??? What? Is he for real then goes on to talk of his challenge on nani, a ridiculous view especially from an ex professional.
Souness must have dementia
What var is missing is intent. What's going on in a player's head. They should have little mri scanners on their heads so their thoughts can be read.
Graeme Souness complaining about risky challenges. 😂 That bloke built his entire career on being a thug.
1:17 ur welcome, lads
Good old Chop Suey
POV: you searched I nearly broke nanis leg
i see souness kept stum when carragher mentioned some of his tackles ,dear god he did do it on purpose
1:21
It shouldn't of happened in the first place. If your a goalkeeper you don't slide in and take someone's legs like that. How would Jordan Pickford like it if someone did it to him.
I nearly broke Nani's leg
Carra defending Shitford? fkn traitor? wtf? what have i just fookin heard?
VAR... Dont make me laugh.  That was a straight red all day long.
bit rich of souness to criticize someone for rash and dangerous tackles. Look at him playing, talentless, only aggressive
My respect for Pickford 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
A assault 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Souness talking about terrible tackles...a BIT RICH innit
Souness would rip Carraghers head off tbf 🤣
Souie not afraid to say it as he sees it. Good man.
Pickford is not sorry whatsoever
Carra is a complete arse hole hate that man...
Because it’s offside u can’t just attack someone
I'm old enough to remember Souness deliberately hurting people in tackles.
Gramme ,you too did many bad tackles during your day man....
‘Oh behave graham’😂😂
Nonsense
Mane kicked city keeper in the face,same difference ,it was also  accidental  part of football ,stop whinging
VAR is a tool.. Takes a tool, to know a tool, doesn't it Graeme.?
Carra : with the tackles you did 😏behave yourself graham 😂😂😂😂 I laughed so hard when a 60+ year old got told to behave lol
OH and by the way have seen footage of Souness tackles
What happens in the next derby if an LFC player badly injures an EFC player and EFC fans make death threats. What do you do go down the John Lennon route (that cost him his life). LFC should publicly condem LFC fans from making death threats, thats a much bigger issue than the red card
A red card would have been fair and better then we would  not have to put up with the hysterics from ex LFC players. does anyone think LFC should publicly denounce death threats by LFC fans as Pickford is employing bodyguards to protect his family
VAR is another tool to help the bigger clubs
a tackle like that should never be made even by accident and he didnt even get booked.
"the tackles you did? behave Graeme" looooooool
Nobody:  This whole comment section: *Roy Keane*
Where's Souness comment about this dirt tackle being very English?
When you nearly broke your nanny’s leg 1:21
Sack the granny on. VAR should have been banned for 5 games Pickford is a disgrace
You say mistake after mistake after mistake what about corruption corruption corruption still taking place...???
What's wrong with Jordan shumaker pickford
Its a res red forsure. No questions no discussions.
But what was pogba doing when this happened 🤔
Now fabinho's out looooool
He went for the ball 😅
Virgil has hacked his way all over pitches for the past few years and have ended many players years with his brutish play. I have no pity what so ever for him here now that he got what was coming to him. He is a hack!
agree with Carragher all the way, u think Sonny would try to hurt someone on purpose. it’s the game
Why should it help Jürgen? Are we penalising the act or temepering with Liverpool chances?
Compare the VAR kit   .. .com
You guys, if you wanna have something to do when you’re bored check my channel out ❤️❤️🔥
Souness 😄👍
Souness is spot on; close thread.
Only FIFA could make VAR an absolute shambles
Jamie" no one goes out to deliberately hurt a player" Roy Keane and Souness, hold my cup
Carragher: I don't think that anyone goes out the way to deliberately hurt someone. He then paused and corrects it, 99 percent.  My guess is, he suddenly remembered Roy Keane.
...Carra, ...gone down to the level i saw souness a few years ago after the scum thing, Carra, Bootle blue-nose knob-end, it was about the fact that the thug got away with actual bodily harm that was wrong, Carra's stance here is awful.
Van Dijk's eagerness got the best of him, he was flying around and he almost got a yellow card after 2 minutes of play. Cant believe Carragher almost broke his nanny's leg.
If Graeme souness was to play VAR would've spotted every single action of his.
Carrahger is a fanny the gobin he did  on a wee lassie .
Just shows how bad a goalkeeper pickford is !he just completely lost all control and launched himself at vandyke . Can't believe he is England's number 1 we will never win anything with this joke of a keeper between the posts.
Oliver's "competence" is self evident! As is VAR. Pickford is mental and there is no excuse for that challenge!
why are Liverpool fan acting like Van Dijk just died lol. Neymar 2014 was worse and not much ppl cried ab it like this van injured lol.
Well said Darren Moore..
when its slowed down it always looks worse, things happen. so wat
Played the game long enough, Pickford is one of those cases where he has absolutely nothing between his 2 ears. He’s clumsy, most keepers are with their feet.But to say players don’t go out to intentionally hurt other players is absolute rubbish. It’s easy to break a guys leg, it’s easy to rupture a guys ligaments in football . We’ve all seen over the years who these players are. They’re pretenders, pretending to be hard. Pickford falls into the minority of footballers and goalkeepers especially, they just don’t know how to tackle.
LMAOO WHAT IS THAT MIC FROM JC, man is boutta give himself a nice shave while reporting
dickfort,  matchless fort！
Jamie "I'm afraid to lose my job so I'm going to spew nonsense"
its nigh on impossible .. but that was a mistake .. Souness being a fanny again.
Why aren’t the refs interviewed after the game like players and manegers?🙄
Never listened to anybody in Football more biased and bitter than this guy.. Surprised he didn't blame Pogba 🤦‍♂️😒🙄
Whoever was the VAR official for this game is a disgrace. Half of Van Dijk's arm was offside. For christ sake that's not offside. And then the Pickford challenge, and then a couple of atoms of Sadio Mane was offside for the winner. Disgusting
Respect to caragher
Liverpool were cheated! The referees invariably make decisions based on which teams will or won’t benefit. Neither the referee nor the VAR officials were lacking in the ability to make a decision. They had all the information they needed, however; Liverpool would benefit from the send off so they decided that nothing untoward happened. Quite likely they are fans of other top of the table teams. English football is becoming unwatchable as a result of teams being cheated by referees and defended by equally biased pundits sitting in studios. The NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball aren’t perfect, but the officials don’t make calls based on personal team preferences. Clearly this happens in the UK.
COVID already took supporters away from stadium, if the FA not careful bad VAR decisions will turn fans all over the world away from EPL
Carra backing pickford..shut it , he did it purposefully
Conservative, stubborn, negligent, arrogant, and the lack of being humble in hindsight. Wow, must be English then? Or is this something else ? If the challenge was made upon Harry Kane, would the result be the same ? What would the result of this situation have been in any other country in Europe, even in Scotland or Ireland - do you think ?
I work in stockley park one of the offices.... there are liverpool shirts in the windows.... dodgy place.
Liverpool will finish 10th now
Roy Keane did and I’m an Irish person saying that..
Bit rich for Souness to be talking about horror tackles like Pickfords one he was notorious for them lol
Souness.... Hahaha, you mug, remember your tackles?
Liverpool fans will not forget what Pickford did
Agree with Grame.   Shame on FA to 'cover up the Referee and VAR". Why afraid to make the righteous decision?   Why does it feel like LFC got screwed.........ON AND OFF THE PITCH??
The mug only good at splitting at  little girls
Pickford should be banned from soccer,it was a vicious foul,one Rooney would have been proud of in his days at man u/fa.13>1.Amen.
A disingenuous explanation from Carragher re: "I don't think anyone goes out of their way"......am sure that some do and some do not but he is confused between intention and outcome.
Anyone with half a football brain should understand it’s a red, it’s concerning we are questioning anything else, for football & VAR, and Jamie carraghers opinion 🙄
jesus souness has some front, look at some of his tackles on you tube.
Well said Jamie
Jamie looks like Quasimodo with that coat on lmao
VAR is making referees look stupid
Souness is clueless. They didn't even check the tackle because they were checking the VVD offside and Mane was offside too (by centimetres).
Is Carragher trying to jam that mic UP his nose?
Carragher as a player was an LFC legend but as a pundit he is a waste of space
pickford is just a spastic idiot .. thats all
Souness is an old curmudgeon who shouldn’t be on tv
Sourness you were a dirty bastard. Fact. I remember you Hacking away at Ray wilkins(ENGLAND V SCOTLAND) and he was a teammate of yours at Rangers. So foff. Sourness.
Carras gone way down in my estimation. Defending the undefenseable. Blert
Maybe it's cuz Pickford is a goalie. He's used to diving for the ball and just automatically dived for it.  Still should've been a red card though.
Why does Jamie keeping looking up he looks bordeline pissed😅
Pool fans : laugh when other players get injured and loose the league.  Now : you get what you deserve Wish you well 75 mil defender.
Hope we get an argument about VVD injuring James now in the first couple of minutes. Literally smashed him hoping he wouldn't cut them open and he injured cut them open anyway.
Cretinous comments from Souness, as per.  Using language like 'assault' is precisely why BANTZ (ugh) devolves into death threats.
Any one would think van dyik was the first player ever to get injured. Move on
stop jamie your just been controversial  it was a sending off
Graham muppet face always he did this he did that get over it
Bullshit Jamie u don't tackle like that if u don't want to hurt someone, worst tackle I've ever seen
Salty souness
Why didn't the ref just go and look at the pitch side monitor to see pickfords challenge , var is a total joke and the people at stockley Park need glasses.
How does Souness still have a job? Always talks pointless shite and when someone like Carragher makes a fair elequoent point he just ignores them and carries on his dated rambles. Let's not forget as a player he was an absolute monster who nearly ended multiple careers. Can't stand the man but massive respect to Jamie for a rare moment on unbiased punditry you almost never see it on sky sports these days 👏👏👏
I’m glad Jamie said to souness about the tackles he made as he was a dirty git !! Such a hypocrite, the way he talks about new managers not getting it right when he was the main cause that lfc went on a run of 30 years to win the league with his bad management, he’s such a bad pundit
If this was a lower club centre back got injured it wouldn’t have this much talking about no one would care but cos it’s vvd everyone is talking about it
Pickford should be banned. He may have finished Van's career. That was an assault indeed.
I agree with Souness...the referee just point for the offside and not for that horrible career ending tackle.. With the availability of the advanced technology today...it was a disgrace
Carraghers tackle on Nani was appalling. But absolutely hilarious.
Carra is giving Sky's opinion, not his. He's not this stupid. he is however under contract.
sure Jamie but a lunge like that is a no-no.. ttal NO. you know it injures real bad.
They applied the law. VAR and officials applied the law. Debate the law not the incident
The law is flawed. If, after an offside, and so tackle cannot be punished then its a farce. Otherwise after an offside you could punch the ref in the nose and not be culpable.
Souness was an absolute nail.
Souness.  One of the dirtiest players ever to walk on a pitch.  He needs to shut up
I don’t know why people have a dig at Souness.  Sure he dished out a bit in his days but he also got hacked plenty of times.  If my memory serves me right I think the Dinamo Bucharest players tried to kick him off the park in 2nd leg of 1983-84 European Cup semi final in Bucharest.
Var is now being used to cheat in matches. Their have been blatant wrong decisions made in games that are beyond believe, and are favouring the big teams, not in this case, but var officials really are taking the piss!
The only thing VAR has done is ruin the game of football!
Sourpuss was one of the dirtiest twats that ever played for Liverpool, but only one of them. For turn coat to say players don't intentionally  try to injure players is a joke.
To all the kids calling Souness a hypocrite, he's not calling for Pickford's head. Rather, he's criticizing the referee & VAR for failing to penalize Pickford for the challenge. He's pissed that they saw that challenge and didn't deem it a Red Card offence.
Pickford was intent on doing some damage how he rushed out both feet off ground and should have been sent off..End of. Talking about refs and officials at Stockley Park. Like Carra said Oliver is the best in the PL and all the rest should be up to his standard, they don't use the monitor at all. It should have been done and Pickford should be facing a large ban and fine. It's a body contact sport but this challenge was a clear cut assault.
Watched the Champions League tonight because I have no reason to believe it's corrupt like the premier corrupt league.  We have some english sludge on Saturday. No doubt sky and the prem league have already decided which way the refs decisions will go.
The scouse accent is the most annoying thing I swr
Comedy gold from cara .... & true 🤣😂
Carragher,that’s y England will never win World Cup and Euro.
"That wasn't a tackle it was an assault" Jesus where's this game heading? Bunch of panzies getting payed millions to roll around on the grass, were his legs broken, fractured, sprained, even damaged? No GET UP! I used to see worse tackles than than in the school yard 🤣🤣🤣
Shut up souness ya prick
wow Graeme Souness is actually right about something. its just embarrassing at this level that the ref can't spot the most obvious red card of the season despite perfect angle and VAR back up.
2:50 priceless.
Souness  ha ha if it was pogba he would have said great tackle
Souness you hypocrite.
Souness absolute spot on!!
Get Howard Webb back.
Souness acting like he never stamped on someone lol
Pickford and Ramos bumming each others donut.
Prickford was a car crash waiting to  happen. Seriously the mans a danger. He did this to Deli Ali however it didn't result in a serious injury. And that rugby tackle on that Newcastle player.
There should be a new stat on FIFA called 'Off The Ball Intelligence'. I would give Pickford 0
He’s got away with that because he’s a keeper, if that had been an outfield player, no hesitation red
What is Graeme dosent understand, that they dont see it? Its obv. David Coote is corrupt.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
VAR has made football an absolute joke. I agree with carragher. Pickford clearly didn't mean to hurt vvd on purpose
It’s how keepers tackle
They are giving the green light for players to do whatever they want when play is stopped.
Wtf is carra on? How’s he on tv? Pure rubbish. Can’t even speak English
Souness has a cheek. He was the dirtiest bastard going when he played football.
Surely var officiates in phases like in rugby...so the 1st decision is was the player offside yes...thats the end of it...if the player was on  side its a penalty and player gets sent off...just how I see it
That was a malicious tackle and there was time to get the decision right. The premiere league referees are fake and compromised but you cant say that apparently.
If it hadn't happened to a Liverpool player Souness wouldn't fuss about that tackle, he'd be saying it's a man's game, get up and play on.
The reality is, players do go into challenges to injure them, or rather, to inflict pain on them, no I don't think they'd want to be responsible for ending a career but lets be honest. They get a pat on the back when they got in the locker room if they got away with it it only depends on the severity of the outcome whether they feel bad/apologize for it.  Graeme is more honest about things rather than trying to give a narrative that's easily digestible.
Maybe the grass was too long.
Sergio Ramos
Graeme is right
Sounness was one of the dirtiest players in football history. He's got a real short memory he has.
Souness was the dirtiest footballer of all time
You did not assault players did you Graham ? Lol
Souness is bang on , VAR has put English refs under the microscope and exposed them as not up to standard
"Real speed time"  Darren Moore,  2020
Pickford's silence is shameful time for a public apology  That is the least he could do
Carras spot the absolute cheek of souness he was an animal when it came to challenges
Pickford is a calamity and is known for it... simple. Bad challenge and would not surprise me if he knew what he was doing these boys know the body and how to tackle and how not to tackle... dont make them or us out to be stupid.
Give this guy a normal mic !
6:01 "sitting in a television studio, standing on the fence supporting their mates" THANK YOU!!!!! ffs Dermot callagher is a prime example. All they ever do is say "he must be thinking this" then finding a way to defend the most heinous of decisions. Those twats would be worse.
Souness has always been a dirty bully. Still is. And a very dishonest man.
Keano take that you bastard
The Video referee in  Rugby helps the referee make certain decisions and steers him or her in the right direction,VAR is a joke and isnt fit for purpose
I'm from Holland and this is so terrible :( We finally have a chance to do (somewhat) well in an end tournament seeing that Mempis Depay is back, De Ligt is training at Juventus again, so he will probably be back soon and now VVD is out... Let's hope he can recover quickly for Liverpool and The Netherlands, and for Virgil himself of course!!
Couldn't agree with Carra more Pickford would have made a split second decision in his head and done everything to block the ball unfortunately hurting VVD in the process, no player (Apart from Keane 😂) would actually in that split second situation think to cause harm to the professional opponent it doesn't work like that, he should retrospectively recieved a red card but nothing more I think anything more would be terribly harsh and affect the game.
Souness criticising Pickford for a bad tackle..... ironic
If Alisson did this to Michael Keane no one would be talking about it. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Carra’s the only pundit there without reeking of Liverpool bias
If a referee can,t see that tackle from Pickford , Then He shouldn,t referee ever again. If I was Van Dyk I would bring out an official Complaint on Pickford, Pickford,s a Thug and a Brainless one at that. I would take Pickford to Court. That tackle was as good as an Assault. he could have ended His career.
Imagine him talking about referees when the filthy decisions that went for rangers sickened most neutrals in Scotland. Mainly Celtic. If he was the football purist that he makes out why is he not in management. Money. He took a backhander in Scotland which has been hushed up. Corrupt scumbag. No wonder the scousers hate him. Rangers will not allow VAR in Scotland.
Irony from that thug Souness.
Cry me a river souness you little bitch. You say its impossible VAR makes mistakes. Guess var was turned off last season then ye.
Souness is only bullying about this because its Liverpool player.
Hahahaha if it was in favor of Liverpool we wouldn’t be hearing all this ...they’ve been cheating for Liverpool since last season ..so have a taste of that also 😂😂😂😂
Souness needs removing he’s far to emotional and biased towards Liverpool even when they don’t play on that day. He may as well wear a Liverpool kit for work. The guy is a prick.
These VAR ref's really are taking a ride.   Watch /listen to the TMO in rugby union. Last saturdays euro final is a good example of how a VAR ref should be operating. But i can't see it changing while the Football ref's are being overseen by inadequate leaders who think they know everything.    Yes the rugby TMO looks for foul play, both deliberate and accidental and speaks into the ref's earpiece to stop the game at the next break of play and take a look on the big screen, so everybody can see.
*Alternative title:*  _"Carragher gets interrupted shaving his moustache with a microphone razor"_
with the amount of money involved in the EPL how can have a team looking at the VAR. It should be 3 people working to make a decision.
To Jordan Pickford Today its Van Dijk and it will be you or your loved ones tomorrow
Its a bad precedent that the English league will set if Jordan Pickford is not banned No one will ever defend any English player if they get such an injury
Jordan Pickford is the goal keeper of the National Team and that's why you guys are ignoring the ban
Love Souness.
Nobody talks about the possibility of a rigged game, w VAR refs and players involved. It’s not far from possible. Professional refs wouldn’t miss a tackle like that. They see everything w that technology.
Its football, red or not is part of the game, good tackle or bad is part of the game, lucky or not is part of the game , as time flies, its all behind...
Carragher solid player , actually very good player at his best but as pundit really low class, you can't expect much of someone who starts day with glad of something strong% , English commentators still funny ( bc of their stupid comments though).
Why doesn’t Souness go sit and monitor VAR and give the decisions?
Souness finger-wagging about thuggery. Ahem.
Imagine Carragher and Souness talking about not trying to “hurt someone” or it being an “assault “. Get real, they were both guilty of far worse. But Souness’ point is spot on, how that wasn’t given with VAR is a joke, and this is from a complete neutral.
Listen to ur elder bitches
He was trying to stop a goal, not hurt him
Jamie ROY KEANE
How Jamie still has a job at sky after gobbing out his car onto a young girl is beyond me.
Graeme Souness is the biggest hypocrite. He would have said the exact opposite if it happened to any other team's player
If Michael Oliver is our best referee we are fucked
Imagine Pepe, Ramos and Keane in the studio during this.
officials should have press conferences after every match, just like EVERY manager or player.
Where was all this debate when mee snapped Wesley's leg who is still out with injury for over a year.... its because its virgil and liverpool.
it IS an assault.
What a knobhead you are sourness.... About time you were pensioned off you dickhead. You used to go out to deliberately hurt other players and i have heard you boast about it. It was a bad tackle with no intent to hurt the player but in football accidents can and do happen. Move on because the bitterness is still there and at your age you should keep your mouth shut. Hopefully a place in a nursing home is in your bear future you dinosaur.
“We want to get the decisions right; and that’s where we’re at with this discussion”  Thanks Darren..
Carragher gives me the feeling we are in 1970 with his old ass microfoon
Jamie stop raising your eyes
Carra wtf you talking about
Pickford should probably play outfield
No injurys last season..injurys this season..thats life..we lost laporte..you won the league..thats life..ok..good
Souness giving out about vicious tackle guy did some brutal tackles in his day
Referee got it right, the rules are wrong, get over it
If Jordan Pickford was of any other nationality, he’d be in the stocks by now. The English bias towards their own is totally disgusting.
Carra is a blue simple as.. bellend.
The grass was too long ;-)
How much money does Souness have on Liverpool for the title?
How much money does Souness have on Liverpool for the title?
Just a reminder that Pickford already did this type of tackle, fortunately he didn't do to Mandzukic what he did to Virgil, go look up Croatia-England in WC semifinal game, it's the 105th minute of the game.
Hope carragher takes a, look at this interview and realises what idiotic fool he is.  laughing when Graham talks about  bad tackles. Maybe it's just  me but I think he tries to have a dig ar liverpool any chance gets. Rob keane is not my cup of but he would put carragher in his place and give him a good " ciceail suas an asal"
Get over it
Piss poor ref and 💩 Man Utd and liverpool selling there arses now for 💴
2:49
Sergio Ramos goes out of his way to hurt people. just sayin.
1 thing that can save Pickford: "its my area"
Really like Carra, feel as if over past few seasons his commentary has gotten much better and less biased. IMO the best pundit on Sky Sports aside from Keane when he’s on
You know what's funny, these guys go on about the referees missing things and not seeing stuff, I'm pretty sure that everybody in the entire stadium watching the match, at some point during the 90mins will miss something happen, on or off the ball, in every game... So to expect the ref's to see everything is just crazy, refs do need more help if you want the games to be fair as pos.
Souness hypocrit he assaulted players.week in week out cock
Graeme Souness an expert in making horrendous tackles during his playing days, talk about Mr Pot and the kettle?
imagine pickford is a BLACK MAN
Van Dijk is also a proffessional fouler and gers away with it. He got a taste of his own pill for me.
How can anyone defend Pickford?
Even if Pickford doesn't intend to, there has to be the punishment there as a deterrent. All players should have the welfare of their opponents in mind when making a challenge, so that they do not do what Pickford did.
Carragher is an Everton supporter, what do you expect from that piece of shite.
But what does this mean for Pulisic?
Just a reckless tackle. Should’ve been sent... that’s the end of it. This is football
Why is Carra consuming the microphone?
It was a good tackle
Looking forward down the line to the reception The Kop give Pickford, they won't forget.
Am old enough to remember Schumacher clattering the French player World watching 82 world cup .No booking for the keeper then either! Sickening  As a Red wish Big Virgil a speedy recovery. Pickford Karma is real  YNWA 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
If var was in operation when souness was playing, he would be sent off every other game
Thank you Carra for talking sense, it’s a contact sport, worse happened to Gomes by Son and his card was overturned!
1:40 *Pepe has entered the chat*
Red Card, Penalty, there can’t be no other decision
These scousers are always MOANING. Will they pffhukkkkkkkinnn shut up already
I really admire Carragher, and Souness can be a bit hot headed at times, but I absolutely agree with Souness here. How VAR could miss that a serious career ending challenge took place is beyond me. The most revealing slow mo is the one showing Van Dijk's face as Pickford closes in on him. He saw it coming, it was obviously an utterly ridiculous  challenge, both players knew it as it was happening, and Van Dijk refused to accept Pickford's apology. Damn right.
Just get VAR out of my game!
Go 'ed Souey 👊
I think Everton played dirty in a few tackles in that game and the 3rd liverpool goal should be allowed as the decisions for offside is getting really stupid .
Why did Carra try to break his nannys leg
"Michael Oliver is the best referee". 😂😂😂 Yeah, I can see why liverpool biased pundits might think that.  Oliver then Mike Dean are the worst 2 referees in the game.
Of course footballers try and hurt players, I’ve seen them deliberately break players legs in anger. Regret follows I’ve no doubt but in the heat of cattle they want to break the player.
Your  mouth is reckless souness
Micheal Oliver best ref? The man that left his hawk eye watch at home 😂😂 he’s a try hard who wants centre stage when he refs. He’s either a victim at being bullied at school or failed the test to become a police officer!!!
Did that to me I'd knocked him out was a right knee cruncher just watching it over makes my face frown and goes through me like knife through butter.
The tackle, ok it is being debated. The tackle and a dissalowed winner that was a perfectly good goal=whats going on. Var is ruining the game.
Souness got called out ..well done Carra 👏
Arsenal had 3 players who had broken legs, ankles and those players have their careers ended or the players had playing career completely taken away from them
"Thats assault " says the bloke who punched a Dinamo Bucharest player in the European Cup semi-final in 1984 at Anfield and broke his jaw in the process !!
The referee is becoming irrelevant. He should have at least gone to a pitch side monitor and then  make the final decision. Why should someone else looking at a screen get the decision?
Souness is a proper bell-end.... one of the dirtiest players in the history of football complaining about a tackle that in his day, in this fixture, would not even have gotten reported.... go do one Souness, you cock    /
For the expert With his hardy resolve and epic ‘70s ‘stache, Graeme Souness looked like the kind of guy you wouldn’t want to mess with, and his well-roundedness and creativity made him an icon on the pitch. So did his tendency towards the violent tackle.  In his first appearance at Ibrox, he was sent off after two bookings, one for sending his cleat spikes into George McCluskey’s thigh (“My boot ran up his leg!” he later joked). Later on in his career, during a stint as the manager of Liverpool largely viewed as an unsuccessful one, he became notorious for locking horns with players in the dressing room.
A precedence should be set ! What example is this incident  to junior and amateur  football ?   Where there is no VAR !  What would the police do if a person did this to another person  on civvy street ?
It wasn’t a tackle , it was an assault .... Pickford should be out for the same time that VVD is out ‼️
Cara doing a Farley
No but Souness needs to understand the importance of the 'chain' of events. As it was offside, Pickford was subjected to a situation where pressure was high and thus Van Dijk being in a more advantageous position than he would have been if he was onside, forcing a pickford to pressure quite hastily causing the reckless challenge. But yeah fair enough, he should be warned, but forget about any yellow cards etc.
Carraghers a wankbag
Liverpool won the league via VAR DECISIONS LAST SEASON ......seemed to work just fine then......🤔
Stoke fans come to mind
Another LiVARpool love in by sky sports.
Let's be honest - The tackle was 'clumsy' at worst. Nothing more.
Let's be honest - The tackle was 'clumsy' at worst. Nothing more.
Liverpool fans pretending they've never had a player make a bad tackle. Slippy Gerrard was one of the worst 2 footed tacklers ever, so you RedSh*te supporters need to get a grip.
Liverpool Fans: Offended by Everything - Ashamed of Nothing.
violent tackles should be checked before Offside
Jamie is an Everton fan at heart, don't forget that!
Got nothing against Pickford but I don’t buy the ‘not deliberate’ argument. Certainly in the past and you still see it today: the goalies when claiming air balls would jump up Muay Thai style with the knee close to attackers face in order to discourage him getting closer. So goalies know what they’re doing: “don’t come in my box (heh-heh) unless you wanna get hurt”.
I hate it when pundits beat around the bush, rather than just say how it is. There are only two options available. Either the VAR's David Coote is incompetent, or he is corrupt. The latter is more likely. This was even more farcical than when Bruno Fernandes got a penalty for jumping on a Villa player's leg. Anyone who isn't completely brain dead sees it for what it is. Incompetence is not an option. The game is bent, and has been for years. The English referees are not this bad, they are told to make these decisions. There is not a person in the world that don't think Pickford should have a straight red.
If this was to a wolves or Brighton cb no one would bat an eye lid so WHO CARES
You can be sent off after the final whistle, so the earlier offside is irrelevant, for once I am in complete agreement with Souness
Why must the mic be so close to Carragher's mouth lol
Carra has his steampunk mic for this one
Should have been red card but no penalty
Was not a tactical and not a red card
Love him or hate him sourness lol 😆  the man use to deliberately pass the ball to the opposition just so he could half him in 2 different era tho Hardy times
It’s quite simple; had it not been offside, then Pickford would’ve been sent off. However because the offside was before the foul the foul doesn’t stand; (Unless the referee deems the foul to of been deliberate).  IMHO Pickford was very very lucky it was reckless and deserve it of a red card but the referees have to abide to certain guidelines therefore blaming the referee achieves nothing.  When are football pundits going actually to learn the rules. They get paid tens of thousands of pounds a year to comment on football; but don’t take a few hours before the season starts to learn any changes to the rules.
Souness is the most biased pundit out there
Agree re Pickford but am convinced that Richarlason knew what he was doing with his.
I get what you’re saying souness. But did you really have to bring up pogba?
Defender trying to become striker pays the price... Lol😅
If the whistle is blown for offside, then play stops and no tackle is made. Just like if a player scores a goal then var check for offside and it turns out offside. Then the goal is ruled out. Therefore the tackle gets ruled out. Unless he runs at him to throw a punch . I don't see what the problem is. Was a bad tackle.
Yet One of your own admitted injuring his own teammate in order to replace him🤭
Bear in mind that Carragher is an Evertonian
Liverpool do dangerous tackles all the time, how many times have we seen Van Dijk push opposition into the hoardings around the ground, or take a chunk out of them?  This time it's gone the other way.  It's a contact sport, and it's a mans game.  It's horrible to see him injured, but that's the luck of the draw.  No need for any (more) pity parties.
Souness is  a pillock.
United fan here - Carragher spot on.
The problem we have now lies in var. Before var we would have spoken about this, called ref error, pickfords error but move on. There was room for error. Not var is here and mistakes are still being made. It's moaned about, complained about more. Both carra and souness have solid points. There needs to be a review across the board at whether var is actually ruining the game, instead of being in place and still making mistakes (somehow)
Souness embarrasses himself....like always
Souness has gone soft. Amazing tackle by Pickford. Pick him for the World Cup team juts off that.
Sourness spent his career smashing players up
Would GS be piping up if this wasn't a Liverpool player that got injured in this manner? VVD will be heavily missed and yes it is was a terrible tackle therefore the referee should have had the bollocks to send JP off however GS is making a load of noise as he has sentimental allegiances to LCFC. I used to watch GS back in the 70s/80s for Liverpool and Rangers - trust me he would know all about assaults on a football pitch. Get well soon VVD.
Jordan Pickford is soo iritating. I wouldnt want players to be injured that bad. Coming from a United fan
You bunch of shameless hypocrite, there are over 4 Arsenal players whose legs were broken, I did not hear the same outcry. Bloody scoutsers always playing the victim. ZIP IT.
Graeme is an upset and biased Liverpool fan! Stop saying all of these when those decisions were against Liverpool! These decisions by VAR are not good! 100% But you did not talk about these since now! VAR has been shambolic for a long time!
what a different Souness when its scousers on the wrong end of a decisions
I love carra but he's talking pure nonsense here.   Reckless, potentially career ending, tackle. Someone's health is far more important than an offside.......  This is not the first time with Pickford also.
Carra teri jaal rahi hai VVD out for season means Liverpool ki season is doomed.... 😂😂
Souness talking about assault.... which is correct. But souness  used to do tackles like that every week.
Ben Mee wasn't banned for basically scissoring Wesleys leg into a reverse wishbone, so I don't see why Pickford would be penalised.
BEAUTIFUL TACKLE! WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? UNITED FAN 😎😎😎
Pickford does nothing really wrong imo. Its a penalty yes if its NOT offside. Is it a red card offence. No yellow at best. Pickford has to come off his line and attempt to smother the ball. Its just unfortunate how he caught VVD. If VVD just tumbles over Pickford nobody says anything.  Lol just watched the tackle again for the 20th time.... its a Red Card all day long 😅  NOT a penalty because the play was offside but a red card offence for technically an off the ball challenge.
Carragher's not covering himself with glory pointing out the tackles Graeme used to make especially when Carragher knows only too well that we're in a different generation with heightened emphasis on technology. Also if anyone thought that after he made that challenge on Nani he thought anything other than 'gotcha' is deluded. Despite his insight can be really brash at times.
We have the right to walk into a safe working environment. That is what footballers do, they entertain the masses with the beautiful game, their skill, talent, flair, technique and pace. FA shld have charged Rich and Pickford with unsportsmanlike conduct and ban them from playing the game we love. If it is found, that the behavior witnessed by all was intentional and deliberate as a tactic or strategy then Everton shld face the consequences. VAR shld be scrapped. Referees and linesman shld rely on themselves, they are the final authority on the pitch. In games past, the game flowed, not anymore
i remember dirk kuyt going into mid-air for an awful tackle on Phil Neville... watch it on you tube...  Not even a booking... and later scored the winning goal via a penalty....  Pickford was spreading himself - yes he was reckless.. but swings and roundabouts do come to mind.
Souness talking about not hurting others.  Funny. He was one of the rougher players on the field.
Love Souey...Liverpool legend BUT...kettle...pot...black...short memory
The decision of the referee is unprofessional. Such tackle is totally unacceptable. Pickford was lucky to stay in the game.
Carra is a complete numpty! Never liked him, thought he was a mediocre player and proving to be a worse pundit
JC, you are a sxxx of Liverpool fan
Why did the ref not go and view the monitor , what's the point in them if they dont use it, rather than leaving it to someone else to call it
It’s a straight red
I do agree with cara on this, but when a player does potentially end a players career the punishment should be harsher.
Van dijk shouldnt have been out of position it's his fault
Behave!
This bitter miserable old man needs replacing now
Michael Oliver best ref? should have seen him last season in fa cup Sheffield Wednesday vs man city. shocking. gave city everything
i blame man united we bought var. we control var 🤣🤣🤣 var is corrupt let’s blame united...some of the things iv heard from scousers lol
Souness is right.....its impossible to make a mistakes given the tech they have yet this tackle and the Mane offside were wrong in one game!!!!  VAR peeps need replacing by three senior referees with a majority voting system in place.  The NFL never make a mistake with video reply decisions and alot of the calls are matters of opinion...in football its black and white
Cancer Dickford
Why don’t they use the pitch side monitor’s ???????
Pickford is a runt. There's no way that wasn't deliberate
Can anybody explain this microphone?
Var is a tool and so is carragher
The hypocrisy of Souness lol he did worst tackles than that whilst he was playing
Everton should alot more aggression during the game, I want liverpool to do the same. Hard tackles are gonna happen, we all wish it was the old day were the great battles were and we got on with it
Lol clowns. Especially Souness. Keep crying
One of the most disgusting tackles I’ve seen in ages. Red card all day. Im not Liverpool fan at all. Horrendous.
Bravo to carra, I feel for vvd, but there has been many times where a slide tackle has finalised past the throw in line and a player has ended up in the stands.. it’s still only a throw in, it was end of play just like it was end of play at the off side.. it’s not like it’s a fight on the way off the pitch it was a coming together after the end of a play ..  I don’t know how Graham still as a job he is an out and out Liverpool fan and there’s no devils advocate to his thoughts like there is with the likes of Neville carra or even Keane
Is Souness saying that referring is easy? Maybe he should do it then.
if that was a player doing that on the pitch and not a keeper its a red card simple as
Why feel bad for Liverpool  Last season kept getting favor from var anyhow and the only match var goes against them they want to make a case out of it that’s bs. Injuries happen in football. Speedy recovery to vvd btw
That was nothing compared to Vince Jones tackles
Var almost as embarrassing as souness
Tbf he did get the ball!
Nothing wrong with VAR or the officials. The rules were applied as they are written. For him to be sent off it has to be malicious as the ball is dead. It wasn't malicious, it was careless.
So what Souness is saying is that decisions can be made on actions that are not counted as in play?
man city had a season of bad var decisions last year is it different now its Liverpool on the end of it show it on big screen so ref can see it and make a decision get rid of stockly park
Of course they don’t mention when mane kicked Mina
Wow.. think Darren gave the most balanced analysis there in his 30 odd seconds of airtime!
2 scumbags talking about another scumbag
I have heard that Jordan pickford will be the new face on crunchy bars 😂😂😂
Funny how suddenly souness hates VAR after he’s been defending all these stupid handball decisions
Cara with the tackles you did bet he wouldn't say that to Graeme face🥊💥🤔
Players who have 100% tried to hurt another player: 1.John Hartson vs Eyal Berkovic 2.Roy Keane vs Alf Inge Haaland 3.Mario Balotelli vs Scott Parker 4.Luis Suarez vs Ivanovic 5.Leonardo vs Tab Ramos 6.Ryan Shawcross vs Aaron Ramsey 7.Sergio Aguero vs David Luiz 8.Alan Shearer vs Neil Lennon 9.Neil Ruddock vs Andy Cole 10.Basile Boli vs Stuart Pearce 11.Zuniga vs Neymar 12.Stan Collymore vs Carra  13.Tyrone Mings vs Zlatan 14.Zlatan vs any defender 15.Sergio Ramos vs Salah 16.Pepe vs Everyone 17: All of Cameroon vs Claudio Cannigia This totally happens when players are angry or have a vendetta vs their opponent
Souness shouldn't be speaking about these tackles. He's such a hypocrite.
how can any supporter celebrate any goal? VAR is killing the game. I am not even happy any more when my team scores.  i cant believe than VAR is making the game this unexciting. in a game each team should get 2 appeals and if it done Var should not mix in with the games?
Souness is the most biased pundit ive ever seen if anything is against liverpool hes all over it
As a manager also. He made an awful ‘tackle’ on Jason McAteer at Blackburn Rovers during a training session. The guys a complete hypocrite!
You can’t give a foul after another foul. You can’t award any action after another action. It’s logically the same principle as awarding a goal after an offside. ‘Oh but you can’t award that offside, it was a wonder goal.’  Yeah but he was offside.   It was a bad tackle. He didn’t punch him in the face. Get over it.
I am not a Liverpool fan, however Liverpool was robbed. Sadio Mane Offside was a rediculous decision. Goal should have stood.
Souness is so biased its actually funny...... Horrible pundit
It doesn’t even take a good referee to make either of those decisions though 🤣 any football fan could see neither were offside! What on Earth are they doing up there?!
'Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness have a reasonable discussion about VAR and mostly agree'. There fixed your clickbait headline.
You gotta love English and all other leagues all complain how VAR is used however none is using it the same way UEFA use it in champions league how come there this things don't happen ?????
The big problem with VAR is the clear and obvious rule...if the decision is incorrect it should be rectified...the interpretation of the on field ref should no longer be valid as soon as it goes to VAR due to their ability to see it in all angles
Like you did to NANI
Carra: " I don't think anyone comes out to deliberately hurt someone". Roy Keane on Alfe Inge-Haaland. Enuf said.
Graeme Galatasaray legend <3 ❤️💛
Okay but still deserves punishment once reviewed after the game. Doesn’t intend to hurt but he could’ve ended his career. That requires a consequence.
Jordan Henderson should have ordered the LFC payers off the pitch when Pickford wasn't sent off.
Players wanna hurt people all the time.. but they don’t wanna break legs and Pickford wasn’t even trying to foul it was just a slightly late tackle
Dont remember all this fuss last year for Laporte
Restrospective bans... thats not how it works. As an Arsenal fan our players have had some shocking injuries Eduardo against Birmingham and Ramsey against Stoke, those players got 3 match bans and those injury were much more horrific. Yes it sucks VVD is out for Liverpool but banning players based on injuries how can you always intepret intent?.
I thought David Plucknett started commentating 🤨
Why the mike so close to his mouth
This is what happens when your top of league. You get all the decisions... Liverpool should know from last season
That tackle to me is wrong Pickford knew exactly what he was doing also Richarlison Ramos was deliberate on Salah seens like part of liverpools opositions game plan these days ...
Souness is crying like a girl. It’s a men’s sport tackles fly every now and then VVD is not the first person tackled like that. Horrible incidents happen but they are part of accidents. Not like Pickford woke up that morning thinking he’ll end VVDs career tonight.
Meanwhile pickford will be more than happy to see their rivals empire fall infront of them and  just chillin enjoying their spell
Carragher is a very annoying pundit who seems to think he knows it all. Souness is 100% right regarding the Pickford situation.
Wow the last guy there talking sense.... thats not right sly sports?? Hire another crank who wont highlight your irrational thought processes
Souness is bang on. He is just highlighting the bullshit that is the FA
Another United fan here -- I love the rivalry rather than talk a lot of crap about LFC. I've seen their best sides and was a contemporary of Craig Johnson's in Australia. Terrible tackle. Don't think it was intentional but it's got to be a red. I agree with Carragher: have the best retired refs available on the VAR. This is a huge blow to Liverpool's season. I think retro punishment is valid if everyone has missed something obvious. Hope VVD recovers well. That's a very tough injury to come back from. I think he has the mettle to do it. Some guys don't. One thing I will say: I've been involved in sports for over 50 years and it's strange how many times a key player gets knocked out for the season, and someone you mightn't even expect steps up to the plate, makes their name, and does a great job. Time will tell.
Souness didn't hold back when he played.
souness is a dirty hun
So 6 months on we are still saying that the ref should look at the pitchside monitor. Like they do in sensible countries
Carragher is trying to make believe people on innocent of violent players. Everybody knows how this have been going year by year when some players go directly to injur others just because angriness.
Listen to souness the little wetwipe
Sourness is essentially saying the VAR referee is totally incompetent or lacks Integrity.
For once I agree with Carragher, this happens to all clubs it’s a contact sport. Did other clubs moan as much as this lot when their players get injured? No they didn’t. Liverpool is meant to be ‘the best team in Europe’? One player gets injured and they’re flapping 😂 I can think of sides with 2,3,4 players out and still won leagues.
Carragher your delusional
Players do sometimes want to hurt other players
Michael Oliver isn't the best referee his the worst referee ever
it's more football it's a shame this var it's your fault the league
Souness is insufferable
Pickford for prime minister ! It’s about time Liverpool has some bad luck 🤣😂🤣 great seeing there fans crying like little girls 😥😥 the mighty LFC have been found out and reduced to mid table contenders 🤣🤣🤣
Graeme is the worst pundit since Michael Owen. He’s pure senile and can’t even get his mediocre opinion out of his stuttering mouth.
1:21 When you go round your gran's house and she's ran out of biscuits
FA need to banned pickford until vvd has recovered.
How many Player Get ACL injury in the PL . . But of course because it happened to  Liverpool Player then Its Dangerous . . .  Fabinho , Robertson , arnold . . Sometime they play dirty too . . Just because they dont have victim yet then they are always good . .  When other player make the same thing to their teammate, then its The End Of The World . . .🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️  Get Well Soon VVD . . .🙏🙏🙏
JC is full of sht bet he was buzzin
Maybe the grass was left a bit long
So why hasn’t Jordan Pickford apologised to Virgil
You can’t be called offside if your arms and hands are protruding, so l don’t know why he was called offside. Every Referee should know this, it has been around for awhile. It is considered that arms and hands are not used in general play, if it’s a shoulder then Yes you are offside
How many legs can you break: Pepe & Ramos...🤔🤔🤔
VVD wasn’t even offside. DCL leg was playing him on. Shocking decision. Virgil potentially career ending.
Yes pickford has no intention to hurt VVD, but the tackle is for amateur level. Just tackle here and there😑
Whatever's lurking above Carra's head it's starting to give him Bonk eye 😂
Keep crying Liverpool fans, if this happened to a west ham player or any smaller team player no one would talk about it. Bye bye to your career van dijk.
Pickford made a mistake in a tight area but Souness as a player,and as a man is an out and out nasty piece of work. I know men who have had to sort him out because of his horrible out of order behavior off the pitch,  including my own father in the 80"s. Before any red defends him just remember he left your club but none of his teammates gave a toss, even worse when he was the manager when he came back trying to model a thug team, signed Julian Dicks, Ruddock etc and destroyed your boot room  set up. Try to remember the lack of concearn VVD showed after the horror tackle he made vs Napoli. It's just football he said and you agreed, well folks you can't have it both ways.
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life..
Carragher is a disgrace to Liverpool, must really need his job.
Please take Souness off of sky he’s god awful
Souness is such a bellend
Shame on you Jamie, anyone can see this was done on purpose.
Oh Jamie shut up. We know most footballers don’t intend to hurt other players but most people who cause injuries to other players are disciplined. It’s the lack of discipline is why people are outraged. He even said himself Pickford is all over the place so he’s a liability. It was a reckless, dangerous tackle which has gone unpunished. I understand this shouldn’t be turned into a witch hunt, I would never want that for Pickford, but he gets to carry on without even being issued a yellow card! I know injuries and mistakes happen in football but for this to go unpunished is complete madness.
eVARton might march on and win the title if the IT nerds screw the refs heads a turn extra. Offside? Yeah, didn't a  fingernail cross the line and set off the detector? The nerds can actually sharpen the whole thing to set off  the alarm if a player's aura cross the line. Or his thoughts! Or his uncle's thoughts home in tofee land. To get away with a point from this car crash and see it as a victory says a lot of the standard of refs and eVARtonists in the PL. No wonder UEFA doesn't call England when they pick referees for the big games. YAWA!
Souness one of the dirtiest and nastiest players in football criticising a  'bad tackle.'  Stop employing these boring, biased  old reds to discuss football. The place is littered with them.
Leg it souness ye skinny punter
every footballer out there don't tackle the star that play football because it might hurt them and if you do the media will kill you
Darren Moore = Box ticker. Awful.
I don't see why Pickford has to be punished for an unintentional tackle on VVD. It was a 50-50 from both players and it just so happened that VVD walked away from it disadvantaged. Defenders get injured all the time, the fact that we're giving VVD the limelight just goes to show how the league has become biased towards Liverpool.
Jamie Carragher are you forgetting players like Roy Keane, vinnie Jones, gatusso, Costa and joey barton these players were always breaking the rules with terrible tackles, yes maybe not trying to end their career but we're definitely trying to take them out of the game at that point so I disagree with what you said, some players DO try to hurt other players
Jordan Pickford may have ended VVD his career. And he walks away with it. Shame on the FA.
Bad challange by pickford but he tries to smother the ball to save it
Talking absolute sense carragher for once. But sourness has a good point also
Was Graeme sounness not around when Graeme sounness played?
Any chance of getting a petition up to investigate VAR officials? Hoensrky has got to the point now where it's being used and abused just for the sake of business in football. It's got nothing to do with how it goes down with what team deserves it, at the end of it would football fans be more interested to see a 2-2 Merseyside game or a 3-2 Liverpool win again on a Merseyside Derby, I'll let you lot answer that question
"no one goes out of their way to hurt players"  roy keane has entered the chat
Will someone tell Carra where the camera is?
Well,,,I don't usually like carra,,,but big respect to him now @2:47 ,,,standing up to souness as he did
Great idea, separate referees trained with var technology
Everyone was defending son when he broke Gomes leg.
Nothing wrong with VAR ... the problem is with the idiots using it ... The only people who did not think Pickford did anything wrong are the Everton Fans and the idiot in Stockley park ... now the fool in Stockley park needs to explain why he chose to behave like a blind person when he had a job to do.
Var  Should  consist of  5   people  holding  a  Buzzer  all  in  the  same  room or  spread  all  over the  place,not  talking  or   discussing  anything ,would  make  the  world  of   difference   3/2   Mane  level not  offside  and  pickford  Red 4/1   ie  you  would  get   consistency   please do  not  say The  FA     TO   much  expense   etc,pretty  sure this  would  solve  all  the   problems
Carra is the most shittest pundit, complete waffler and talks nonsense
A good ref is now superficial to the stars at Stockley Park. The ultimate control should still lie with the ref. Remember,  Michael Oliver had to disallow a sheff utd goal because the goal line tech failed...even though he knew it was a goal, simply because rules are rules and the ref didn't matter.
Souness a total hypocrite. He went out most games to injure fellow professionals and succeeded with some players out for months .
Pickford made that same tackle on Deli Ali
Premier League is fixed!!
Carragher is losing the plot or has been told not to agree with the 100% of people who know it was a horrific tackle, Keane didn't smash the knee of Haland, Gerrard didn't smash in to Campbell in one of Gerrards First Derbys, you could go on and on. Jamie is talking through his backside.
If he's not offside, this doesn't happen. If Pickford saw red ot would be an offside player gaining an advantage. FACT
Yet again VAR has over shadowed the game, it needs to go... It's killing the game.
Lol you do realize that football is political. People have favorites.
Pickford banned 🚫 1 year
Pickford weak link for Everton and England
Jamie's argument is idiotic. It doesn't matter what Pickford intended.  Most people don't intend to run people over on the road but if they do they are punished. Pickford was so reckless he deserved a red card.
Souness  actually broke someone's jaw in one game, didn't look accidental neither.
Carra looks like he's in a space simulator trying to remain conscious.
SOUNESS IS CHANGING HIS MIND ABT VAR NOW. LISTEN TO HIM TALK ABT VAR ,WHEN DIER HANDBALL CALL WAS MADE AGAINST NEWCASTLE..TWOFACE..
i understand graeme’s point to be fair
I've got it. What if 2 players go for a challenge like pickford and vergil did. 1 of the players has to go off because of the injury he sustained in the challenge.  And the other player who was involved gets sent off aswell.   Is that to simple.
Bottom line, VAR needs to be revised seriously. 2 seasons back that would have been taken more seriously and Pickford would have gotten at least a yellow card...
With all the latest technology all the different camera screens with millions spent on VAR should the refs at stockley park still be in employment especially after tonight & the covid crisis?
just let these referees look at the pitch side monitor and make their own decision  after seeing it back
Wouldn't usually say this but Jamie Carragher is spot on, especially abut the ex refs with the most experience being used for VAR
I really don’t like Souness but when it comes to this and VAR in particular he’s spot on.
How Souness survived the sky sports cull i will never know  The man talks absolute bollocks
carragher a prick has to keep going on about beating man utd. you lost a load of matches carragher
Souness shitting it cuz Liverpool are fucked now. Carragher just defending a fellow Englishman.
Pickford crushes Van Dijk's leg  Keane: I like him
Arsenal fan here, that challenge was disgusting. You can literally see Pickford staring at VVD and not the ball. Not saying it’s deliberate but he should receive a lengthy ban for being so reckless
How ironic  The most animated we have ever seen Mr Souness get and he is slagging off a ill timed and red card tackle  something he did nearly every game he played
The foul wouldn't of happened if the ref had of seen the offside it isnt the goalkeeper fault
Souness is right,and i'm a Blue.
There was no retrospective action against Lamela. What's good for one team should be good for everyone else.
I have said this before, but I just don't get why VAR isn't used like it is in rugby. When stadiums reopen if there is a big decision to be made put it up on the big screen so everyone in the stadium can see it, officials and fans. This would mean the ref gets to see what happens and be in communication with VAR people. Plus, it would mean all the fans could see it and not just be waiting with no clue what is happening. Also, for offside if a decision cannot be made in 1 minute the attacker should get the benefit of the doubt. Also as a side note I think offside is measured to tightly, its just getting to the point of splitting hairs, they should increase the distance a player can be from the last man to a foot
soz carra but ur talking nonsense
Pity Sourness didn't stay in Stockley Park.
carra got wonky eyes
What about gobbing on someone from your car?
Terrible tackle he could’ve broken Van Dijk leg...same with Richardson tackle on Thiago...he should get banned and fined..horrible tackle
You cant protect a player from a foul unless you can see the future lol the foul has to happen to be a foul then to protect the player you reprimand the player after that, like pickford makes tackle it's a red not referee has to protect him from the foul cuz again how is it possible to do that
It’s because the grass was too long
Wenger was right, English referees are bizarrely incompetent. There's a reason they never go to world cups.
One bitter man that Souness why he is a pundit ? I do not know? And also the hypocrisy of him
sounesss should retire
Had Everton had a 2 or more goals lead, I BET Hendo's goal would be allowed. If VAR is not banned football could lose  its popularity, sad.
Graeme is right and the ref was not far and he saw it check the pictures of the game
Carra making sense and souness as always nonsense
AFTER analyzing the game it comes to me that the official in the VAR was bias against LIVERPOOL FC , If it was the offside on VVD not the offside on mane not given I could  accept it was fairly  arbitrated by VAR. because we have no way to check that VAR is right/ correct we have to agreed. When one looks VVD was played ONSIDE by one play leg comparable to mane situation when one looks you cannot see with your eye that mane is offside THE BAIS VAR official had to give offside on VVD to not concede another goal .and as for man not to concede a third GOAL After talking to my friend we thought that VAR was BIAS. And wanted LP to lose or draw and did what the official could to prevent that from happing but the world have found them out .EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A LIVERPOOL FAN.. they can do it to any team they want . what is the meaning of football than ?
These man acting asif virgil died
He must be very stupid then
Why the bloody hell can´t referees not go and consult pitchside monitors, like they do in other countries??
How is Carragher still employed??? This animal flobbed on a child!!!!
Souness on Pickford Tackel: "It's outrageous for me its like WOW"  Meanwhile in his hayday he used to tackle like that every WEEK!!!! LOOOOOL
Carra sounds like an idiot, totally wrong on this one.
The game is dying a slow death with ridiculous rule changes and incompetent officials.
Souness knows a bad clonker when he sees ones. Bottom line - he is right. That challenge was a really bad challenge. I don't know what the mincing around words and nonsense is. It was a really bad challenge. It should have been dealt with.   Otherwise - You set a new env. That being if defenders know an offside is coming, properly clonk people, you won't get done for it as the offside gets called instead.
How did Michael Oliver become the best referee. If that is the best we got then its really sad.
Get over it Souness, you did worse most games you played in. Wouldn't be half as animated if it wasn't Liverpool. Butt hurt much.
Souness is one of the worst pundits ever
Pickford should have been sent off!!!! No doubt !!!!
Love seeing Souness having a hissy  fit. Comedy gold.
Let's just remember that souness nearly started a war in turkey
Pickford's challenge was an absolute disgrace. 100 times worse than Suarez's "bite"  yet Suarez gets banned for 12 games and Pickford gets away scott free.
What  total hypocrisy by Souness, he was a player who deliberately went out to maime his opponents. No one believes Pickford set out to hurt VVD  but no one denies it was an awful attempt at blocking a shot and he should have been sent off. Souness was a thug to of player.
wrong is wrong
I’ve been an Everton fan for well over 40 years and there’s no doubt in my mind that Pickford should have been red carded.  I think goalkeepers, perhaps more than any other position on the pitch, are under tremendous pressure as their mistakes often result in conceding a goal.  At the moment I honestly think Pickford has some serious issues in judgement and needs to be stood down for his own well being.  I don’t think he intended to injure Van Dijk but he was clearly reckless and he needs to calm down...a lot!
The real question is why was Jamie trying to break his grandmothers leg.   Bless him though for still calling her Nanny at his age.
The Sky sports bias is sickening.
Would they be even remotely bothered if pickford had done that to some ordinary player...???..i think not.
i wonder how gomes feel about that tackle..
English  players  or not but should  be punish pickford  should  be punished
Pickford  should  be punished  we demand
If Thugford was in any way regretful for that 'accidental' tackle he'd have gone over to see if VVD was ok. That would have made it somewhat acceptable. Deserves what ever comes his way. Was only AFTER the game when he shat himself thinking about the abuse he'd get he told Hendo to say sorry for him.
Carragher chatting pure bollox here "Michael Olivers the best referee in the Premier, maybe he hasn't seen it." He was looking dead at it lol
Jamie. The game has changed since you and Graeme have played. Between VAR and all the officials it’s ludicrous that Pickford hasn’t been punished. That’s the point. Not that you and Graeme did it back in the day. Players should’nt be allowed to do that and get away with it. Move on with the times.
Fair play to Carra speaking sense, while souness talks utter shite waving his bias liverpool flag
This has nothing to do with intent of injuring a player, the fact is it was a careless and reckless challenge. Michael Oliver or the VAR official should have looked at the foul, irrespective of the offside verdict. Oliver is the main man in the middle, he must have seen the foul, so most of the blame falls onto him.
Difference is, Carragher and Nani were at best renaults Van dyck is a rolls royce of a player, carra talks utter bollocks.
Graeme Souness talking about shocking tackles... 😂😂😂
Souness is now mr fair play , he was a dirty cheat when he played
The ball was at the tackle. How does he miss it?
The problem with Carragher is that he thinks he is always right,like Alan Hansen always thought.
I can't believe  that you carragher  are backing a player who could  end  virgil's career  . You are a everton supporter  by the looks of it
Imagine if Pogba made the tackle...
It’s crazy how a player can get sent of for foul language after the final whistle but a goalkeeper can’t face retrospective punishment for a knee high lunge.
It would be difficult to prove that so called tackle was premeditated.
its not about if he means it hundreds of players can say they didnt mean it but not the point .it a dangerous play that leaves a man injury for months an he should be  PUNISH...it a let off he is an England  player THATs why....
excellent goalkeeper and man. a scoundrel. I hope that Everton and the England national team will have the same success that they have had as before.
Dw Graeme it’s Paul Pogba’s fault
Pickford showing why England will never win anything while he's in goal. Guys an overgrown child, clumsiest goalie I've ever seen
Did anyone complained when Steven Gerrard did the same way back then?.. Ppfftt!!
Whats the thing with the bloody microphone?
I don't really understand what Jamie is saying, but i challenge myself, thats why i'm here, to take the challenge of understanding him.
The premier league , the bookies league xD everything is written
You nearly broke your nans leg? Never fail to surprise me carra 😂
Souness calling bad tackles.. he made a living off tackles like that! Var is a tool... leave it at that Graeme
If that’s how football is going now I don’t want to watch it, the decisions were a disgrace.
I can't stand Souness but he's right in what he is saying
‘Clear and obvious’ mistakes when dealing with penalties,but they don’t go by that with offside . How tf is that offside clear and obvious
Pickford is NOT a world class keeper, he is at best average and his challenge was a disgrace. He was out of control and he should face a very long suspension. he could have ended another players career and that is from a Spurs supporter.
The comments are classic
Love when souness whinges 😁
'Corruption of the highest order' What a coincidence it was the game following the proposed changes to this corrupt league. It's bent like everything else in the UK. LET'S GET OUT!
Souness is a grade A bellend
I love seeing Souness triggered 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Souness: That was Paul Pogbas fault
Here is what Liverpool can do in the next derby. Wait for an attack and get one of their players to be deliberately offside. When the pass is made, punch Pickford in the face because, once its proven offside, the assault will be ignored, their rules.
I would like to see a rule where a player who injures another player is banned for as long as the other player is injured for up to a maximum of the remainder of the season - IF - and its a big if - a panel decide unanimously that there was a reckless tackle or deliberate intent to injure
It was never a red
I would get the police involved if the FA doesn't do anything, it was an assault! if the flag went up at the point of offside like in the old days then the injury would not of happened.
This not the first time pickford has done this .....
Pickford the butcher
Souness is a flannel
The ref and pickford are going straight to the gulag
No Jamie, no neutral wants pickford banned. Only the victims
I read Pickford's hero was Schumacher. I thought it was Michael, but it seems to be Toni Schumacher :)
All this and he didn’t mean it?? Then he would’ve killed him if he meant it. It is obvious he wanted to hurt him he clamped his leg, thats deliberate
Fools speak because they have to speak..... Pickford is not guilty no matter whether there is VAR or not. He would wouldn't  injure anyone intentionally. These thing happen. Henderson goal was a goal, though.
I can't take anymore of Souness.  The hypocrisy of the man is astonishing.  Had it been a Liverpool player tackling an Everton player like that he would not be shouting from the rafters. Enough is enough...
A penny for the thoughts of the now deposed Egyptian despot Hosni Mubarak. Food for thought I think you'll all agree
I hate liverpool. That was a red card and penalty.
Had it been any other player it wouldnt been this hyped out
Why is VAR designed to look out for millimeter offsides and leave out life threatening violet foul play like the ones seen here on Van Dijk and Thiago, when I think about this, my head just spins...
The irony is Pickford is exactly the keeper Souness would’ve bought when he was Liverpool manager
VAR what a absolute joke it’s just killing the game
Can't stand Liverpool. But not sending Pickford off for that, is farcical.
This would be brushed under the carpet without a debate if it wasn’t a Liverpool player. Imagine if it was a wolves player. Or Man U player lol
Carra - Pickford did it Souness - No, Pogba did it
Career ending tackle Pickford should be banned for a minimum of five games absolutely reckless, and that’s from a Chelsea fan, hope he recovers quickly.
Carra: “I believe 99% of professional players will not try and hurt someone” 100%!
Total over reaction. Pickford went for the ball not the man
Red card all day long
Pickford got the ball...
I think the problem was that it was just a typical football play, not directly an aggression, so they couldn't just send Jordan off, since the action stopped (technically) with the offside.
Var sucks, they only make refereeing mistakes far more frustrating, fix it or get it gone.
Souness was a complete animal and deliberately injured many players. A scumbag.
Retired referees in the VAR room is a great idea. Howard Webb to cover all United games. (United fan)
Souness: Well Paul pogba has to be to blame for this tackle.
What nonsense..  the best rugby union refs are able to accept mistakes pointed out to them from the video ref. Difference is you can hear the conversation they have.
Pickford intends to do that.
Nice to see Darren Moore comfortably stepping into Joe Hart’s shoes there.
If you listen to carragher talking and watch his eye movement im guessing he's coked up,watch it carefully
Graeme trying to stay calm lest he gets another heart attack
The audacity of Souness complaining about any tackle 😂😂😂
AJAX thanks Pickford.
Jamie Caragher is soooooooo right.
Graham Souness Hypocrisy unbelievable. Destroys Pickford but says Lewis Dunk was just making himself big. Short memory to. I remember you playing
Got no problem with the message just the messenger. I'm a fan of Souness but come on Graeme I've seen you deliberately nearly cut opponents in half smacks a bit of hypocrisy really
We are not complaining about VAR. We are complaining about the English refs in general. They. Are. The. Problem.
Used to be a good tackle for souness
Roy Keane watching this 😳😳😳😳
Carragher is so desperate to stay on the right side of his paymasters he has lost all objectivity.
Souness pot calling kettle black, he was a dirty player.
Carragher, wake up. Even Graeme says it's a bad tackle.
Is the PL owned by the mafias now??  If these clowns can't do their job then it's time to sack them and hire real officials from Spain.
Souness is losing it
Souness is 100% right on this subject
I love when Souness cries
Thanks Jamie
Pickford should be banned atleast for few games the tackle was absolutely disgusting
Never mind the VAR in Stockley Park the HUMANS that made the decision it was off side , Who do they support and did the have a bet on this game?
Robertson's lunge!!! RED CARD all day! Funny not a word bout that!
Micheal Oliver is an awful ref
Souness is dead right and Cara has always too much to say, not the best punter in the world, souness has more experience that Cara so I go with Greame Souness.
why arent these cnuts debating robertsons challenge on allan where there wasnt even a card
if an Everton player is on offside then his leg can be broken and just say it is the same as Pickford's case
It's not even a red. Yellow at best.
If the play is offside, the play is automatically dead. It was a terrible challenge, and unfortunately VVD ended up with a terrible injury. However, they can’t discipline Pickford for a play that should have never been allowed to continue in the first place. It’s just a series of unfortunate events.
Michael Oliver is the worst  hypocrite of  referee. He is a chat.
Carragher “The tackles you did” 😂😂
VAR is killing the game....referee bad decision...so next time whenever in offside position can tackle or cause injury to opponent player.
Can’t believe they’re still talking about this, it was a horrible challenge but it happens. But when mane actually used his elbow on KT against Arsenal nothing was said and that was clearly deliberate!
Seemed to changed his tune on var with those handballs to this awful tackle....... Oh, it was against his scouse team, god souness is an idiot
Disgraceful for a player like that to get clattered by a rent boy like Pickford and nothing. NOTHING. With replays, technology, nothing. A disgraceful decision which will condemn Liverpool to fourth or lower. These decisions affect results, referees need to be accountable for them, across the leagues.
maybe not malicious but it was reckless and deservedly a red card
Astoundingly rich for Souness to come out with dangerous challenges.
Sourness says it assault must b bad coming from him boy did he know how to take ball and man great in the eighties
How could the ref miss it he was standing there in full view. Disgusting
A few months ago I came across a recommendation from Mr. Daniel how he helped investors make big money from their investments.  and decided to try what I have.  Now my little one has become something great that I did not expect ... thanks to him I win and live very well.  You can connect him on Telegram at @Danielwrightfx or WhatsApp: +17865272947 and you would be the one testifying
it's doesn't matter if there is intend or not. just look at the foul and decide if it's a red card or not. forget about the rest.
Typical one way..... Not one mention of the fact that in the first couple of minutes van dijk thwacked through two Everton players in mid and defrnce..... No mention, pickfird terrible tackle but you set the tone early in the derby and got clattered ya self
Carragher is right. That’s it.
The other debate which needs to be had here is around the molly-coddling of goalkeepers and what they get away with.  Keepers get more protection than anyone else from referees. Some of it is probably warranted to protect them from the risk of serious injuries but some of it definitely isn't warranted, like how refs almost always give a free kick any time an attacker jumps to contest a header against a keeper. This despite the fact they have a massive advantage in that scenario because they can reach far higher with their arms than any outfield player can with their head.  Meanwhile, goalkeepers for years have got away with committing clear and often dangerous fouls with no repercussions. Keepers often rush out and catch players late - not usually as badly as Pickford - but as long as the striker has got a shot off they very rarely get punished for it. Likewise, I have seen many keepers come out to punch a ball and clatter into players without getting anywhere near it. Sometimes they even punch the player instead of the ball and it's somehow still never given as a foul.  It's time to stop the preferential treatment of goalkeepers in my opinion. If they 'can't tackle' as some say then they shouldn't attempt to. The same rules apply to all players on the pitch and if a goalkeeper endangers an opponent with a challenge, they should be sent off just like anyone else.
Graeme Souness is one to talk about assaults. The way he played football was disgusting even for his era.
Everton fan here about time we got a bit of luck against lfc  they get all the help lfc
Carra..You’re a prick. If a defender tackled like that he would be banned for 12 weeks. Everton apply this kind of ‘tackle’ in EVERY game against Liverpool.
Tim sherwood ended my teachers career- Lionel morgan
Carraghers a bit of a scumbag
Carra... your wrong. Do you think if Pickford was’nt English & plays for England, he’d had stayed on that pitch???? *POOR CHALLENGE* are you mad?? It was a touch of GBH!!
Of all the people commenting on this,souness has to be the last person claiming this was a wild challenge. If any one has doubts you can look at souness tackle compilation.
VAR is a waste of money that should be invested in struggling clubs.  This BS is getting out of hand! What's the point?!  I'm a United fan and I hate what Pickford did. It's called a beautiful game for a reason .. and it's why we celebrate fair play winners!
But still he need to be book
Your a fine one to talk Souness, Some of the stunts you pulled as a player,Stamping on opposing players,Running your studs down players calfs, You were one dirty bastard
Souness for stockley
Souness clashes with himself in the mirror every day.
Keane is a different breed, you insult him, he hits back. No questions asked. But today, football players are more professional. Very few outside of pitch see other club players as enemies anymore, and fewer wants to hurt anyone. Pickford is no Ramos, i dont think he meant it. I can understand liverpool fan's frustration and anger, but at this point im afraid for pickford being mob lynched.
whata load of tosh.      VAR needs to give THEMSELVES a red card.     the whole blummin world could see that pickford should have been off.
Haha Love it 😍
Jamie's a Everton fan. Say no more.
Jordan Pickford is not a bad person, but he is just brainless. How stupid do you have to be to tackle a player like that? Absoloutely shocking! Now Van Dijk is out for 6-9 month, Liverpool fan or not, that is just brutal...
I agree entirely with Mr Souness. Jordan Pickford's challenge was atrocious. By concentrating on the offside the referee and VAR took the cowardly way out of sending off the goalie so soon after kickoff. By doing that, they have basically said that its OK for a goalie to carry a baseball bat and assault any opposition player and get away with it as long as they are deemed offside. An absolutely scandalous decision to set that precedent by the referee.
Jamie Carragher does a great Darren Farley impression 👏
Anybody finds Carragher boring?
Guys for none native English speakers this guy language 👀 is like final exam .
After VAR decisions, there were also 2 serious mistake in this game. 😪
Souness was an excellent tackler when he was at The Boro.
Imagine if the referee had grown a pair and sent off Van Dijk for two of the three yellow card offences he committed prior to getting injured?
Souness talking about assault on a football field. Classic case of pot meet Mr kettle. The most filthiest slyest footballer ever to play the game. Different era  dont make retch .
I'm surprised Souness is the one criticising smallhands and Jamie is the one defending him.
When son broke gomes leg he got a red card , just saying
Liverpool. Outraged by everything, ashamed of nothing.
At what point did a 'discussion' become a 'clash'?
They ask two of the GS, dirtiest players ever about the challenge, one remembers he's a blue the other develops Alzheimer's 🤔
I say again VAR is just 1% of the problem, the English referees are the main problem. They should go up to the monitor and watch whatever incident from different angles and they're professional so they would/should know the decision to makes after what they saw
Is Jamie using world war 2 radio mic?
Liverpool wont win the league because VVD and pickford went for a tackle not for an assault 😂
Don't you just love ex-Liverpool pundits and commentators everywhere ?
If this had involved an outfield player in another part of the pitch it would have resulted in a red card.
Souness said  last season no one can tackle anymore well Mr sourness pickfords proved you wrong.
"Be'ave Graeme!!"
Is Souness wrong tho? No. Refs need to protect players and and that was a horrible tackle on VVD.
VAR is absolute shambles, they need to appoint former player who understands game in VAR room.
According to Melissa Reddy, the technology used at Stockley Park isn't precise enough. She was apparently told this when she was there to be shown how VAR would be used.
Watching the game I remember the commentators at first not reacting at all to how bad that tackle is and only when vvd comes off due to the pain they have a look at it and realise how bad it actually was.
fucked up carrhager
Pot, Kettle Graeme - Pot, Kettle.
Why is Carra using WW2 microphone? He lost a bet to Neville or something?
graeme souness is an awful pundit
Souness calling Jordan Pickford by his full name and Virgil Van Dijk gets called "Virgil"? Tells you everything you need to know about his opinion 🙄😂😂
It's not a question should anything happen to Pickford, the question is what should happen to the decision maker in stockley park. They should  face re-training or banned for a month or something.
whats the point of var if the ref on the pitch cant view the monitor or wont? absolute incompetence
There wasnt nothing wrong with challenge it is was one footed not two and if it was offside the foul was commited while the game should of been stopped the goalkeeper is required to continue till the whistle.
What's with this stupid microphone? Looks like we're in the 1920s.
Its potentially one of the worst tackles in the premier league in the last ten years, he should get a match ban. Literally got away with murder.
Having retired referees with experiences in charge of the VAR room is a brilliant idea
Graeme Souness: "I think it's assault"  Also Graeme Souness few minutes later:"I think Pickford's just trying to make himself big"  So what do you really think?
As far as I'm concerned, carragher is wrong..it was an awful decision by dickford..he should be punished,
Its real speed time
It’s pathetic that referees are given the opportunity to look at an incident themselves, yet they rarely ever do. They clearly prefer passing the book on and leave it to Stockley Park so VAR gets the backlash not themselves for making a poor decision. Shocking system.
Players don't want to hurt each other on purpose. Luis saurez finds that hard to digest
Graeme Souness don't deserve at all to be Pundit, always biased to Liverpool and wonder is he moaning about Pogba all the time isn't he? I like how honest Jamie Carragher!!
If that had been the best ever referee of all time Pierluigi
Liverpool should have won.  the day and age of this football is totally pathetic because of var. yes it can be useful but I see it more as a threat to the future and to deserving teams. Liverpool should have won! Pickford should've had a red.
Of all people, Souness criticizes career ending tackles. Look at a summary of the man's career. Great football skills, one of the most atrocious offenders of the spirit of the game ever.
Would they be having this debate if a   city player got injured no
Souness: Jordan Pickford made a terrible tackle that day but you have to ask yourself why was Pogba in newcastle at the time disgraceful
But Souness said Dunk’s red card was just unfortunate...
Behave Graeme ... imagine it was Pogba on the receiving end ☕️ 🐸
I guess his tackle on Joe Weller was the 1%
VAR is a woman
If its offside I can't b a penalty. So can  he give a red card  with  no penalty?
Pickford intentionally did it he is evil but God will punish him, he's own career will soon end💯🙏
Souness was a hard player he’s done some outrageous tackles so I don’t think he has a lot to stand on 🤣
Fact is there was a red card given in the Brighton game and a straight red was given regardless
Would have being brilliant Roy Keane was on the studio to talk about that
Who’s the other guy?
Carragher is spot on
Cancel var
Souness is 100% here! If your a player now your not guaranteed to be protected when your on the pitch now after what happened to Virgil!
Throw var awaybpleaase
"Supporting their mates at Stockleigh park" - spot on from Souness.  Referees do not speak against other referees just as players are not allowed to, or they face a fine.  It's almost as if there is no mechanism to actually supervise referees and hold them accountable.   The referees are not good enough,  they are watching things in slow motion and making more mistakes than the previous generation of refs.  They are ruining our game.  Speak up and pay the fines boys.
Do you think it might be the grass was to long
What a year this has been. I actually agree 100% with Graeme Souness. Never thought I'd say that. Things are geting crazier by the day! From a neutral too!
"Michael Oliver is the best referee"  Damn. Would hate to see the worst
why is it that in American football they have VAR and no one complains like we do . the system does not work so bring back the old days where the ref made all the decisions be it  right or wrong  ..
Souness talking about the tackle as an "assault" with the cowardly challenges he used to make. Hilarious.
Seriously viera, Keane and souness in there playing days would love that that full force tackles
The should ban this ref 4-5 match
Don’t think he meant to injure him badly? He clearly seen it was van dijk and thought this is my opportunity to take out Liverpool’s best player
Pogba fans looking at graeme with the biggest smile on our faces 🤤 we love to see it
Liverpool fans .... come on forget it .. move on and go again .
Souness “ that would never have happened if they’d cut the grass”
Sky "So Roy whats your take on Pickfords challenge" Roy "Thats his job, its what i expect from my goalkeeper"
Souness tries to make a point about the ref protecting players and jamie tries to make a joke. Total clown.
He was offside therefor anything after is void, just like a goal would be....
No one talked about what the linesman thought should he just not matter
in a few years the connection between VAR and betting rings will come to light..
Pickford is a dangerous and desperate goalkeeper plain and simple...
Jordan Prickford 😅
Englishman - It's OK  Scotsman - It's criminal, must be punished  Player in question - English.
The problem is the rules, you can get a red card after the final whistle but because the VAR check was for offside they dont check any fouls after that point.
Carra is right, ex refs should be on VAR. Ex players would be accused of all sorts.
Greame "I've been to stockley park" souness
Why is carra trying to eat the microphone
Why are they discussing intentions of players? VAR is not Thinkpol. They call the game based on the actions, not the intentions. It goes both ways. Should Son have had his red card rescinded because he felt badly about breaking that player's leg?  No. The decision was based on if he played in a dangerous manner. Whether Jordan Pickford was careless or ruthless doesn't matter. The same can be said about Richarlison. He very well could have been trying to break Thiago's leg, but it didn't matter. The manner in which he went in warranted a straight red. Perhaps Jamie Carragher is defending Jordan Pickford against retaliation from Dutch players in future games, as Richarlison may find himself on the end of something nasty from a Spaniard in the not-so-distant future?
I love how butthurt souness is the prick😂 tackle was awful don’t get me wrong but to see him so butthurt made my day. Everything Jamie said was spot on
He’s not the best referee is he? If he can’t give a blatant red card and rule Liverpool on-side for the last goal then he’s blind..
Jordan pickford is overrated i really dont rate him at all he like kepa
Souness is a hypocritical clueless prick. All he does is chat rubbish and has agendas all the time. Sky need to drop him. Fair play to carra he was talking sense.
It happen but have to b punish
Its not what no one means..its the  rules we are talking about..many people told the judge i didnt mean it your honour  but still goes to prison(  why)  they break the laws.....get it BRO
Carragher showing his true colours , remember he was an Everton fan growing up as a kid 🤗
Omg, var is working exactly how it was designed to do. Covad is less obvious.
Carragher is shite. Shite footballer, even a worse pundit.
VAR is a joke
Pickford is a dead man
Souness the old fart will not be angry and agreed with the referee decision if the i injured player is Pogba.   Hypocrite clown.
Keane and Souness are both idiots!!!
Referees on the pitch should have a watch monitor on their wrist, to have a quick look when something is worth looking at on the large monitor on the sideline. This will improve the flow of the game.
Van dijk clearly dived and should of been sent of himself and klopp just says what he wants about the fa and gets away with it. Always someone else's fault when it comes to this club
I love how salty they are when VAR doesn't go there way. Even though VAR save them multiple times during last season this is why everyone hates scouser.
Just love the passion souness has ,always wears his heart on his sleeve
It's offside though,  so I actually think the ref was right.
In the United Spurs game , United player sent off for an arm , we need consistency here .
Absolute disgrace of a "tackle"
Souness it's the grass to blame
The fines and suspensions are also part of football Carra! Nothing to defendd here
Has Grahame been to Stockley Park before?
As an Everton fan its an absolutely shocking challenge, worse than the Richarlison one. Intentional or not the fact Pickford stays on is a joke. Its not right whats happened and we need consistent refereeing all around.
VAR IS AN AMPLIFICATION OF THE INCOMPETENT REFEREE'S WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD
Souness: I don't know what to think about this,but Pogba.. I mean Pickford should have been sent off
Everton players wanted to assassinate Liverpool players
Players’ intentions don’t matter in football. An own goal for instance counts, whether you wanted to score it or not. Its not about your intentions, but rather about the risk that your behaviour poses. If you come in like Pickford did, you should know that you’re putting an opponent at risk, whether you want to injure van Dijk or not is irrelevant. It’s like drunk driving accidents; no one ever wants to cause one; but the man taking the risk should not go unpunished.
Hahahaha hahaha who remembers souness tackle people the cheek hahahagah
Carra needs to take his blue shirt of
*Ramos entered the group chat*
I really agree with Graeme but some things Jamie said is true as well
I don’t understand how hard it is for a referee to walk to the sideline and look for himself, I get that they have officials in their ear advising them but ultimately it’s the referees decision.
heard graham described as a thug
So biased here. Shouldn’t talk about Liverpool these two. Embarrassing
Pot calling the the kettle black, sanctimonious  Souness, he could be so reckless in the tackle. He can not excuse some of his challenges mittigating them in terms of a different era. He can not say with any credibility that he never tried to deliberately harm an opponent , he more then most of his hard men contemparies with any seriousness.
Jamie Carragher needs to be put to pasture. He feels more sorry for Pickford than he does for Van Dijk. There is a huge possibility that Van Dijk may never be able to play at the level he has been. His whole career is now affected yet poor Pickford should be left alone because he feels bad about it. What an absolute tool.
Followed football all my life. After this game, and the decisions what were made in this game, I am wiping my hands of football. The game is rigged, the scores are predetermined and the football authorities have destroyed thd game. When perfectly legal goals are chalked off for offside whilst showing the public the player is clearly onside, this has to be the time when people wake up and realise football is being used as a tool to control peoples moods and emotions, also creating local rivalries generating hate. I hate to say it but football as we know and love is no longer our sport. It belongs to the devil now.
Jamie what part of the ball is knee high when pickford made the challenge to get the ball ?
When both feet leave the ground - it is a red card except when it's walker with dangerous kick and Kavanagh is refereeing a match involving Arsenal.  Var is a tool like a hammer which doesn't stop the odd psychopath abusing it to bash people they don't like.
Please sky, get Keane in the studio always.
Get rid of VAR let referees and linesman’s make decisions on the pitch only use VAR for goal line technology
Graeme Souness... hypocrisy... well said by Carragher calling him up on it... hmmmm returning to the blue side perhaps....
Just remember Carragher is an everton fan
As Pickford wasn’t even booked can’t he still be charged or has that law changed?
Carragher is a joke.
Pickford is a coward, like 99% of keepers in that situation would bravely go for the ball diving arms n hands 1st to parry ball away or smother it, pickford knew what he was doing the tramp
The officials in var are often trainie refs what ******* if that is where the big descisions are made
It doesn't matter about intent - he was reckless and out of control with both feet off the ground. Which is what's needed for a red card to be given. If there was any intent any ban would be extended beyond the automatic matches given for dangerous play.
How was VAR not this big of a failure at the World Cup?
If Souness said it was bad, then that's all you need to know and the red card should have been brandished.
The decision making in this game was a joke my opinion Pickford should have gone maybe on another day a different ref he would of but then Richarlison gets the red card on a terrible lunge in on Tiargo ? . But to top it all off VAR disallowed a perfectly good goal by Henderson with Mane being offside absolute madness !! .. Bless up . ✌📿⚽️
IT'S NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE.
Graeme complaining is hypocritical he should watch the complications of his tackles back in the day
‘The tackles you done Graeme, behave!’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌
I usually dislike Carragher but I have to say I really respect his opinion this time
Before Var the referees got all the criticism var came in to take pressure off referees completely changed the game i used to love the game. the hard tackles the controversy the game is boring now full of over paid actors that play for money and not for the badge
FYI Souness  went to Stockleigh Park a few months ago!
Rich from Souness
Var is killing the game
Nothing to do with whether Pickford meant it, or whether it helps Klopp or not - Everton still have their goalie, when he should be sitting at home for 10+ games. If this was anywhere else on the pitch he would have been off, whether or not it was offside, whether or not the ball was in play. He couldn't go up to VVD and just punch him after the ball was dead, but somehow because VVD was wrongly deemed offside they ignore this assault. Absolutely disgusting. I never slept all Saturday night after this game, the officiating was that bad, and the injustice of it all. Things need to change, and change fast in the VAR department. Consequences need to be dealt to Pickford. Richarlson got a 3 game ban, and almost broke Thiago's leg, where is the consistency?
I really like Darren Moore as a pundit. Hope to see more of him going forward.
Maybe the grass was too long Graeme? Just like when Villa thrashed your old team? 7-2. get off and let someone unbiased comment on our precious game
Jordan shoemaker
Carra didn't feel bad for Nani challenge Pickford is a British player van dyik will be missed by country and club so England can strive better in football
I don’t understand why people only wonna discuss the rules when it goes against them. VAR has fucked everyone. This is karma for that Big Picture stunt Liverpool tried.
The potential foul wadnt in play. So cant be given. Liverpool fans, cry some more 😂😂😂
Ban Pickford - This isn't his first assault on a player.      He tried the same crap on Dele Alli. It was ridiculous there was no sending off, and a penalty. Terrible that VAR, the ref, and the other officials couldn't see that there was a really dangerous career-ending tackle. Pickford didn't go in for a tackle, he threw in a two-footed attack aimed at the knee of VVD, and he needs to be punished.
Imagine scrolling down then you find this comment                May God bless you
Great tackle 😜
Wow ..Virgil van dijk is injured and wish him all the best and fast recovery but this guy wants hung Pickford cuz Liverpool didn't win ..?!! Question: how many legs you broke in your carrier you dinosaur?
Var should have a face cam of people making the decision they aren't held accountable , shows the biases towards clubs and shows corruption in the league Pickford should of been sent off even if its offside and liverpool should of won that game spurs were robbed by var utd gifted points var is  a joke scrap it and bring back human error and refs missing incidents lol
Loserpool fans should learn the lesson: last year you were celebrating for Laporte injury. Now Karma punished you.
They need to take a lead from other sports. Anytime theres a decision a ref aint sure about the 'video ref' plays it for them again and again until they both agree on what they see. Works really well. But then dont start whining about its slowing the game down. Its an important part of the game to get used to it. Im also available to work in Stockley park with no biases UTT😁
Good to know when its offsides.. you can kick someone hiss ass 2020
Graham stop repeating yourself
"it doesn't help Jurgen now" what?  of course it will, make it fair! everton top of the table they lose their keeper it will help Liverpool... but that is not the point, the point is they should be punishing pickford. I guarantee you that was a non england player they would be punished.  Just like FIFA became too big and corrupt the FBI got involved ...well we need something like this here and clear out these corrupt hierarchy .
Graeme Souness deliberately hurt players in tackles...glass houses Souness
Graeme Souness "It's the bigger picture we're looking at. The fact is that Pogba was at fault in the build up..."
Carra talking a lot of sense here and showing integrity
why are they all quick to defend pickford in this. he doesn't deserve defending he could of ended virgil's career with that reckless takle. he is a disgrace. these refs are a useless they are ruining the game
Bunch of BS from carragher, look at the picture, how high his body and his legs are, knee high...carragher must be blind and stupid saying that 99% players don't want to hurt other players. VAR just robbed 2points for Liverpool and red card to Everton's Keeper. Similar to Man U Martial's red card too.
i cant stand carragher now, idiot. This is not the time to have flash backs of your own time, this game now and this kind of tackle now you need to be vilified and terminated. Our main player has been taken out by plan, yes by plan! they wanted to ruin our season on purpose. Tiago was targeted too. So Jamie carragher just get lost you moron. You evertonian.  Well done Souness!
6:01 the shade there from graeme was beautiful
I likeSouness, but he can’t criticise tackling!
Carragher: * starts talking *  Me: * turns on captions and hopes they make sense *
It should have been treated as an off the ball incident, Pickford red card and free kick to Everton for the offside.
Even the subtitles are getting it wrong tryna keep up with these 2 never mind var.
Take some power away from referees. Players should be given a piece of VAR like DRS in cricket.
souness and his beloved liverpool hes so deluded
Souness  'but will pogba have given the red card'
Love Carra and he is right!
Var is good, referees are dumb.
Graeme on point! Whats the point of the tech if issues like this aren't sorted out.
Souness assault haha. Bad tackle. That's it
Hypocrite or what. Sourness was the jihadi john of football when he played. Go on YouTube and watch his tackles. They make pickfords tackle look tame and he meant them.
VAR IS A JOKE!! Why doesn't the ref look at the pitch side monitor??? Cop out
Wht Graeme is referring is it is not mistake, it is assault.
As someone who likes football and rugby, when you see how well rugby's TMO works compared to footballs VAR it's crazy. Rugby's TMO isn't perfect but it works better than VAR and football needs to look at other sports (not just rugby) who have video referees and have done for a longer period of time and see what works and doesn't. VAR is a joke at the moment
Pickford is not the culprit..it is the duty of refs n VAR officials..they are the main culprits..the officials should be fined n banned.
Souness can’t say nothing about bad tackles, the tube.
If the tackle had have happened to any player other than a Liverpools van dijk yes it was a bad tackle but by god they think they are that privileged let it go move on but no like Ramos on Salah here we go again moan moan moan🙄
caras inner evertonian coming out? haha
Souness is a massive hypocrite when he played he made so many career ending challenge. Pickford made 1 horrible tackle. Souness when he played constantly stamped on people’s leg as well as kicking them as hard as possible
All Liverpool moaning 🤣🤣 he was offside so unlucky
Pickford looked at Van Dijk, then launched himself at Van Dijk with both legs and studs up. Then Pickford twisted his body during the contact. That’s the bit for me, he twisted his body to wrap around Van Dijk’s leg. Twisting your body like that is not part of a goalie trying to block a shot because it makes your body smaller. So that is intentional.
This could already have been the game in which Liverpool loses the PL. Van Dijk out potentially for the rest of the season is a huge blow. And to not give a red card for this tackle is the most ridiculous decision I’ve seen in a long time, on top of that the “offside” goal in the last minute. I’m not a Liverpool fan, but I feel sorry for them
Last season lamela step on cesar's leg intentionally, var and ref said no red card and it was a career ending move
Sorry red shite ,can give it but not take it.
hahahahahaha stop crying bin dippers
Carragher: Makes sense Graeme Souness: Ignores discussion point, launches into useless rant with no particular aim
Carragher is such an evertonian.
Souness hypocrisy at its finest he rattled his fair share of players in his day
Just never tackle like a coward its that simple
I think sourness has had his day..... Back in the 70's! His views are ridiculously laughable he should be a politician
Will this affect his VVD’s future performances? I don’t really know much about this injury..
Doesn't matter if he didn't mean it? It was reckless and endangering the oppenent
Carra : with the tackles you did 😏behave yourself graham 😂😂😂😂 I laughed so hard when a 60+ year old got told to behave lol
Typical English tackle by Pickford. England celebrates that type of challenge
I'd be playing football right now if it wasn't for refs on power trips with no idea✌🏼
Don’t get why this is such an issue - I thought it was ruled offside? If it’s offside then that’s the end of that phase of play and a free kick to Everton, it doesn’t matter what happens afterwards unless there is violent conduct. I understand the uproar if it wasn’t offside and then nothing was given but the reason why there is no penalty and red card is because the Liverpool player was offside not because they didn’t deem it to be a foul. Yes the challenge is poor but I feel that process was correct. If Van Dijk wasn’t injured and it was a little trip by Pickford, they would have reviewed it and said no penalty because it was offside in the lead up. The end result in this case Van Dijk’s injury and Pickfords poor tackle can’t change the logic of decision making that makes no sense. The lineman will let play go on until the end of the phase of play and put the flag up after, so they don’t rule out potentially valid goal, and VAR will use technology to check this - assuming all the technology is accurate which you have to trust this seems like it was an unfortunate situation but correct decision.
Graeme " the challenge was a disgrace and we need to look at what Pogba was doing".
as an everton fan pickford’s tackle was bad an i would’ve gave him a yellow however sadio mané’s tackle on digne was at least a yellow maybe even a red and robertson made two yellow card worthy tackles.   good game
I am on Graeme's side he was winner won way more than Jamie as a player he was a Liverpool legend it was disgrace that clown of a goal keep got away with putting Virgil out for the season.
If there is no foul after a offside flag then next time I’ll wait for a offside flag and punch the next opponent player in sight. Its legal right?
Didn't a former liverpool youth player say he wanted to hurt his colleague? former keane teammate also?
Totally agree with Souness on this one! If 99% are accidents why does a player get sent off?
I think the best example to consider is Son's tackle on Andre Gomes. Gomes was injured badly and Son was given a red, but the suspension was revoked. Bad injuries don't mean red cards.
What's there for Cara to defend pickford. Does it means that the players can do such dangerous moves even if he don't mean it? Even as a Liverpool fan I find his defending of pickford is like how many own goals & silly mistakes he made when he is playing.
The fact is the referees should make the right decisions and have no excuse with all the technology and time they have to make a decision. Anyone can see a red card challenge, especially one as clear as that. That is ridiculous. Nothing against Pickford - the refs must step up. Simple.
The game is so easy to be corrupted now, and get the result that the powers that be want.
Jamies right
They were talking about refs going to the monitor more this season. What a load of nonsense, so many games already refs should have gone to the monitor and haven't.
Why isn't anyone talking about there being a precedent of Jordan Pickford making the same tackle on Dele Alli? I think because of that there should exemplary punishment. And when will we see these ugly clowns who call them referees held accountable for their actions? I urge Sky Sports to start a campaign where referees are subject to a post match interview.  They have been criticised time and again and yet they are getting worse. It is about time they are stop being protected by the FA and the Premier League. Let the incompetent quacks fend for themselves.
Imagine if van dijk never reaches pro Form again because of his leg
I nearly broke nani’s leg. These things happen.  Lol
It wasn't a good decision by pickford to go rushing in like that..I don't think he intended to hurt vvd. .he's been under criticism for a while and a lot of late,everton got another keeper in the window and he surely has to be worried about his place..if he doesn't rush out and vvd tucks it away and it's not ruled offside I'm sure pickford would be under more pressure and receive more criticism
Don’t know what Souness is on about, he’s committed tackles worse than that week in week out when he played. Absolute hippocracy
A conversation without direction.. Barking aggressively to indicate disagreement and please the producers, but unclear what their disagreement was.
The tackle happened move on ffs...ive seen worse tackles happen and they dont babble on about it...but i guess they are chatting waffle cause its a liverpool player 😂
Michael Oliver the best referee!? Hahahahahaha
The ref was negligent and stuffed up. Regardless of whether it was off-side he should have checked the tackle on Virgil and pulled out the red card. This is the whole point of VAR. Not just to check every passage of play that led to a goal.
Cara made a great point about using retired, top-level refs on VAR. That would be a huge step in the right direction at least.
Why’s he calling it VAR like car? Not V.A.R.?
It was a bad tackle, he should have received a red...enough said...the lunge was terrible and he could have broken his leg !!!!!
Rich from Souness
Well said carragher, "the tackles you made " souness was a horrible dangerous player deliberately injuring players
Souness knows a thing or two about bad tackles himself. lol :p
Anyone else who did Pickford’s tackle on VVD would have got a red card. It’s not about the intent; it’s the tackle itself!  Carragher should play a exhibition match with a Pickford-wannabe.
You dont even need a professional referee to say that was a red card?? Even a armature referee would have seen that was a red card !!! Stupid VAR fools!!!!
Maybe a group of ex players and ex managers ex referees should be at stockley
A mild slap on the head can get Neymar a long suspension, while an assault tackle like this not even considered getting a look at the time
Got to agree with Souness on this one. He's not talking about how the tackle was deliberate or not. He's saying VAR ought to have looked at the tackle too. Just looking at offside and completely ignoring a dangerous piece of play from Pickford was dubious to say the least. VAR should have looked at two things. First the offside and then for dangerous play. Was surprised when they didn't look into it. Intentional or not, that was a red card in my opinion.  Horror injury for Van Dijk. Initial assessment says he's gonna be out for 8 months which is the whole season, and by the looks of it he's gonna be a doubt for the Euros as well. Hope he recovers well and gets back to his best.  As for that Mane offside, the less said the better. It was a joke call in my opinion. VAR has taken away the human element from the game🙄
Imagine Howard Webb as an ex ref in the Var room for Man United games
Always playing devils advocate is spitter!  What is his argument with souness? Souness yep put in some shockers but he’s allowed an opinion on the modern game Jamie ‘Spitter’ Carragher!
Jamie's point about the more experienced referees should be in the VAR rooms is spot on
Straight red and a ban shite tackle from the Mackem bastard
Michael Oliver worst referee in England his a supporter of united
Souness was some player.  He was hard. But he could play.   Fair play to Jamie....that was funny like a son chastising his Dad 😂  Some of Graeme's fouls were bordering on worthy of custodial sentences!
Carragher does not know what his talking is defending his England player nonsense analysis from carragher
we need female linesman parading up and down the flanks in just bra and knickers to sort this problem out
The first offense was the offisde so what's the issue? That rule hasn't changed in years and years why should it change now? Oh because Liverpool are without their best player and now they may not win the league without him?  If Van Dijk was not offside then yes 100% Pickfords challenge is worthy of a red. If we red card the Pickford challenge after the initial offense then it opens up a whole other issue within refereeing which already is tragically sub standard. It would then allow referees to pick and choose which of the 2 offenses that happened in quick succession is more worthy of a decision.  Imagine if Pickford did the same thing but just afterwards Mane fouled a defender, would you expect the second offense to be called out but not the first? No, it's all about perspective and the fact is despite it being a horror tackle it was not the initial offesne. The offside happened before the foul, I admit the decision for offside itself is so ridiculously tight but that's the rules.
I haven't watched Pickford much at club level, but whenever he plays for England he always looks "too busy". Throwing himself at everything and everyone, something like this was inevitable! There is no air of calm or control and doesn't seem to inspire defenders with confidence.
VINNIE JONES
Roy Keane is in the 0.1% club
Nigh on impossible eh Graeme
Pepe laughing while listening to this😆
Why do you need to be “The Best Referee” to spot the horrendous tackle Pickford made? Any average fan sitting on their couch looking at the same footage the video ref saw as well can see it was a two red card offence!  Now the best defender in Europe is ruled out for the season. Pickford is extremely overrated.  I dunno what Carragher is going on about, maybe he’s trying to look PC as a Liverpool man...and I 100000% agree with Souness.  Common sense also needs to prevail with the shocking offside calls, it’s ruining our beautiful game :( A finger or a millimetre ahead of the last defender is not an offside...c’mon!
Lessen learned - you notice a player is offside, you can literally roundhouse kick him in the face. If not, how bad can the foul be before it overrides the offside?
Couldn’t believe Pickford got away with this blatant assault. What’s the bloody point of VAR?? And what does being offside have to do with getting clobbered like that. Smh
Carra is smart he knows if pickford is banned their second goalkeeper will probably be better than him
It was just a good old-fashioned Souness tackle.
Would Souness be this passionate if it was a player from another team? Hmm
Souness: "It was Pogba's fault."
Var is there to protect players.. it can’t stop players getting injured Graeme
Games gone soft  Pickford came out to save it with his feet it’s not his fault that VVD missed the ball all I see is a GK closing down a player that is trying to score  It’s coming 2 a point where a defender or a GK have to stand still n just let a attacker score a goal  Games gone soft n if that’s a red then all these refs should be giving reds for when a player goes into a shoulder to shoulder n some how there legs give way 🤦🏼
VAR is a great tool when implemented correctly. It’s just unfortunate that we have incompetent officials in control of said technology. I believe that the officials should be given a set amount of time to make a decision, if they can’t decide within that time frame then it is too close to call and a certain amount of lenience should be given to the players, it is near on impossible to stay onside if the rules are now if your finger tip is ahead of your opponent then you are deemed offside.
"Sitting on the fence supporting their mate"
This is what happens when ur champions, deal with it
Well done carra , souness is a prick who forget he was one of the dirtys players in history ..... don’t get me wrong I agree with graham but if there’s one man who can’t use the “refs are there to protect players” it’s this man thug on the football field be interesting to see if he took such a strong stance had it been a Liverpool player who made the tackle
Red card all day
Am not a Liverpool fan and I never fancy Graeme Souness opinion but in this case I support him I think is a red card cos is a bad challenge. it has nothing to do with offside.
Can they deal with it retrospective.. Penalty in the man u game after the whistle for incident b4 the whistle......
I thought VAR would only go to back to the challenge if it was a red card.
I think it could be nigh on impossible to get it wrong
Sorry but a Pro Baller has no business to tackle like that. And now here's the problem, right I see that offside flag go out I can go in stud and all on the player on the ball and get away with it because sorry it was offside
guys i found a streaming website called totalsportek u dont have to pay that stupid 14.99 for 90 minutes but negatives stream can be buffering like once or twice instructions  1: search totalsportek on browser 2: select first one it should be @t 3:press the link u might have to click it twice because some tabs might pop up 4: some adds might be crazy like u want to spank me or something like that but you can just x it out  reply if works
Fair play to Carra. Souness is a complete 🛎
I swear cara played for Liverpool he goes at Liverpool like he played for Everton his whole career! He seems to pick out bad points of Liverpool all the time how can you defend Jordon Pickford with that challenge!
Souness wouldn't argue so much When Martial got sent off against Tottenham and Lamela didn't because it was a decision against Man united VAR is consistent with no team and I Can't believe Rival fans call us Varchester United
Pickford didnt do it on purpose.. he is just a very very bad goalkeeper..
Come on clearly the VAR guy is a supporter of a rival side City or Utd my guess ?  Pickford + disallowed goal is just too much against Liverpool it needs  investigating for corruption.
Carragher talk bullshit should be red card for pickford that tackle was assullt
Carragher spot on.
Change the offside rule, ref made the correct decision. If he was onside, pickford wouldve been off, simple as that.. its shocking that no one in the studio spoke about this
jordan pickford committed a criminal act, fact & he failed to get punished for it. was it premeditated? perhaps not, but still should get a minimum 6 games ban.
Pogba should of been tracking back
Souness used to assault players all the time and definitely tried to hurt players with career ending tackles himself so to be fair he's probably the only one qualified to comment 😂😂
In my opinion the technology is not quite there yet. You should be able to manipulate the offside freeze frame and rotate it  to be square on with the lines on the pitch or a birds eye view angle, that way it provides clarity on decision made. If you look at the screen shot of mane being offside you can see the line marker is not square on with the 18 yard box line. Taking that into consideration I think mane was offside but like I said tech I not quite there to provide clarity.
Souness is the only one talking sense about VAR.
It’s a straight Red. Even the blind can see...
Must be the first time Souness stood up for a black guy.
Match fixing
BBC sport literally referred to VVD's hack on DCL earlier in the game as an attempt to establish 'he was the daddy'. The injury is unfortunate but let's not pretend Liverpool aren't one of the snidest teams in the world, let alone the league.
Dirty little Prickford!
That’s why they have a monitor
Why are they protecting Jordan. His made a horrific tackles and seriously injured a player. Imagine someone went to court after killing a person and said listen my intention was to kill the passenger I just made a mistake I was recklessly driving. He needs to be face the consequences of his actions. I font care if it was offside if it is a red card offense. Its fine give the offside send pickford off and we play on. This can happen far more now with the linesmen allowing play to go on to see the chance play out then go to VAR and check. So a defender can make horrific career ending tackles and the refs are like oh well it was offside. If hisbtugged him by the shirt or trip him different story but if it's a red card offense for dangerous and reckless play the card should be issued.
Make it like Formula One. In the race stewards, more often than not, you have an ex-driver in the panel. That way, they can say whether it’s just “racing” or if it actually deserves a time penalty. Same in football.
Souness is definitely right in this instant on the bigger picture issues. Carragher on the other tries to be holier than thou as always. Get a grip, Carra.
A Liverpool ex player chatting shite, what's New???  If that happened to a palace player they'd be quiet
Van Dijk is out for 8 months
Souness is a bellend
What a prat Jamie really is...
Regardless of other things going on, situations you cannot ignore, dangerous fouls, fights, abuse! In this case the dangerous foul on vvd was ultimately refused. Apparently it was deemed reckless LMAOO. Pickford should’ve been sent off regardless
Carragher trying to get retired people back into work, sounds like a Tory.
Vvd was down for about 4 minutes going by 1st halfs added time. Why not just check the  challenge on the monitor in that time. It wouldn't of held up play.
Hhhh
These guys never want to come out straight, continuously dodging the truth. Talking so much but saying nothing. Saying the decision should be made right but not wanting to accept that it was a wrong decision, so what are you talking about?
It was a bad tackle. But it was offside so it was not a foul, that's the rule and has been the rule for as long as football if it wasn't offside it was worth 5 reds.
It depends on why the foul was not punished. Was it because the refs didn't see the foul, which seems incredible, or was it that once VVD was ruled offside the ref and VAR didn't consider anything that occurred after the offside was given. If that's the case the rules need clarifying for the referees. Edit: turns out the ref and VAR did see the challenge by Pickford and decided it was not serious enough to merit a sending off. Full marks to Carragher for standing up to Souness.
Souness is righr. It was an assault
Because of Sky's "unbiased" stipulations Carra and Neville have become yes men rather than saying what they think they just come out with the diplomatic BS that they think their paymasters want to hear. Disgrace, Souness and Keaneare  far better at least they are not so scared to tow the line.
This is like Dennis Nilson condemning someone for eating people
Check out youTube Souness knows everyting about terrible tackles, he was the master!!
love seeing that muppet bin dipper foaming at the mouth hahahahahah
Graeme "Paul pogba" souness
Oliver is only brave to show red card to Buffon 🤦🏻‍♂️
Did you watch everton last seson watch how many bad var
Professional footballers dont go out to hurt anyone........ Clearly he has not saw the best of Roy Keane's DVD Surely just because he didnt go to hurt him has nothing to do with the fact he is a bad player !
Souness again being biased as uasul, please get him off this panel, tired of it, I bet if Van dijk made that challenge - "Well if the ref says it's offside you move on"
Souness absolutely fizzing!
drink driver kills someone, regrets it next day. Carragher - let them off, sure they myst feel bad
If this happened to any other club there wouldn’t be this much coverage about it. Liverpool is soft
I can't stand Sourness. He is so biased to LiVARpool. Even went they got humbled by Villa he didn't praise them once, he put it to luck and an off day by Liverpool. At least Jamie has sense. Get Souness out!
It don't matter that it happened after offside was given. Çağlar Söyüncü got sent off for Leicester last season after a goal had been scored and he kicked someone. Pickford done a lot worse than he did, he could've broke both Van Dijk's legs
Graeme just pissed that Liverpool will struggle going forward cus VVD is out for the season. Was defo a shite tackle and red card ahould have been given. All the best to. VVD. What a beast, still walked off the pitch!
The heads have fell of the tourists 😂😂 wasn’t long ago they were singing ‘how’s ya leg seamus coleman , hope you never play football again’ ultimate karma for liVARpool tory fc UTFT 💙💙
If it wasn’t a challenge on van dijk then no one would be talking about it like this...
Oh, Graeme, the tackles you did?!
I'm just here for all the Pogba comments
Carra just talking rubbish if he was there then what would he say?
Souness one of the nastiest dirtiest players ever ! Talk about poacher turned Gamekeeper, hypocrisy is unbelievable !
In English football you can kill someone as long as the player is in offsides.
Roy Keane went to hurt that player with the stamp.
Gary Cahill legit ended Ryan masons career and almost did the same thing to someone else a few weeks later. Nothing
Liverpool's unbelievable luck is running out
This is a joke. Carragher is defending Pickford, as he is an Englishman. If that was De Gea, or Kepa, or Ederson he would have wanted the death penalty. It is a joke how biased this people are.
Roy Keane on Haaland
But what about Pogba?
carragher thats bullsh*t wat r u talking about....
So we have learnt... souness went to stockly part 18 months ago
carragher wtf r u talking about...
So if Pickford got sent off for it would Lpool be given a penalty even though he was offside?
99% of the players not trying to injure someone?? Is he on a substance?? Good god,  what a load of bollocks by Carragher, Souness was dead on!!
Disagree with Carragher, the tackle deserves to be punished, as it stands he’s made the worst tackle in a long time, injured someone who may never be the same player again,  and will not be punished for it.
Souness.. Expert 😂😂 what a mug!!
😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Vdyjk career is finish for me even for lfc league  is end for them
I normally agree with carragher, but he is wrong here, times have changed and that sort of tackle should not be allowed
“I don’t think anyone intends to seriously hurt someone” insert Roy Keane smiling
Pickford made a good strong decision, he was brave. BUT it resulted in what was a horrible tackle that he should have been sent off for.  That's all, mistakes happen. Virgil was unlucky and should feel hard done by, as should Liverpool for not winning the game.
Shut your bag mouth neither mane nor vdyjk was outside
What a idiot souness is
Finally, Carra is the first Red to speak some sense
Shame shame to calager who is trying to protect his nationals keeper   a british
That’s rich coming from souness. He needs to watch some of the clips of him on here from when he was playing if he wants to see an assault.
Nothing new mate , that’s the level of refereeing in premier league , I remember when Burnley player nearly broke matic leg , but because his leg bated the ball , the didn’t consider it foul , and matic had a Red card for getting angry . But nobody talked about it then . But because it’s Liverpool. It got personal .
Jamie’s repressed jealousy over VVD has finally made its transition from passive aggressive these things happen to overt joyous schadenfreude.
I'm sorry but stop Pickford did it on purpose 100% stop defending him. Pickford should get a season long. And VAR needs to go Pickford should have been sent off and Mane is never offside
The most annoying part is where that Dermot bald guy comes on and gives a pathetic justification for the bad decisions by referees.
If Michael Oliver is the best ref in the Premier league, English refereeing is really shite isn’t it.
Calager is British will act as a countryman to protect to his nation goalkeeper everton goal keeper dies not play the ball at all
1:20 he nearly broke his Nan's leg?? What an absolute rotter!
Can a player (victim) punish another player (assailant) with jail if the victim injured or assaulted by another player in the field?
This is a clear evidence of match fixing, anyways if fans can't pay to watch the game might as well make money through the betting industry
Clueless souness
I'm surprised the title doesnt include "heated disagreement"
Carragher is such an idiot. Hes laughed over that nani challenge enough times. Hes on sky to offer alternative opinions on lfc games to appear unbiased when he just comes across as mentally challenged. Pickford should be getting banned for the challenge regardless of intent as it should have been a red card. Regardless of what stevie wonder saw in “stockley park”
Its fun to read these Roy Keane comments in his accent and picture his face expressions
They should undergo eye tests every year if you are a VAR official, such slight margins now you need to be 100% sure
Y’all need to stop giving Graame this much time on the microphone.
remember when he said the newcastle handball against spurs was entertainment and we all said what if that happened to Liverpool , a desicion didnt go their way . Of course it was a red card and i hope VVD recovers soon
where is Roy Keane in this conversation? destroying a career is his topic...
Souness is a big hypocrite. Talk about terrible tackles! He is a living dictionary of prime examples of that. Carragher was spot on calling him out when he asked him to pipe down, asking Souness about his tackles in his career.
Patrice evra be like "I love this game 😂😂😂"
I respect Carragher for not being bias as Souness
“You’ve got to ask yourselves Jamie, where was Pogba there? What is his purpose? Why didn’t he stop Van Dijk from getting injured?”
The referees on the pitch need to be the ones making the decisions after looking at the camera angles
Absolutely disgusting what pickford done to van dijk. He should be banned from months 🤬🤬🤬
He’s right that Pickford probably did not consciously intend to seriously hurt Van Dijk but for sure he intended to stop him in a manner fully violative of the laws of the game, that’s enough. There’s a difference between that and a mistimed tackle
Y’all weren’t saying this when VVD almost murdered Mertens, a man 3 times smaller than him 7-2
Pickford wasnt even looking at the ball. He wanted to hurt someone.
Loserpool getting scare there going back to the mid table club they were last 30 years lmfao.
i dont get it.. it was offside. so you cant give a red for that tackle.. end.
A reckless tackle is a dangererous tackle without intent... Just because there is an absence of intent, it is still  dangerous and therefore endangering a player safety and therfore a red card.
I hate Carragher but loved him giving to Souness who was the dirtiest player of the 70/80s.
Sourness waffling again the bloke talks utter shite let’s have a look at some of his tackles in the past
Carra: Professional footballers will not try to hurt someone. Roy Keane: Hold my tackle.
Liverpool player have taken out players of other teams like Mane on Ederson a few years ago also had their fair rub of the green with VAR like with Wolves last year so stop the moaning.
can jamie get a mic that isnt from the 1940s
He went for the ball you can clearly see his left foot trying to reach the ball and unfortunately van dijk got in the way.
Souness when playing: me see players with balls me break them up Souness when Liv players been tackled: that's illegal, ban them!
Feel sorry for VVD, may he recovers quickly but love to see Souness go mad 😂😂😂😂.
Pickford is a liability, should never be the England goalkeeper, especially as we have two better keepers with better attitudes. Why is Gareth picking him, makes no sense, Roy Hodgeson is a better manager, should not have shopped at iceland.
Michael Oliver is trash
How many times does Souness want to say “Neon”
What is the point of VAR, really? Two awful decisions made by VAR. Liverpool have been robbed of the game and, with Van Dijk out, probably their season as well. And no action against Pickford? Complete disgrace.
This quote comment has got to stop. Please stop it. Its not funny. It seems to be every other comment. Please stop.
Jordan Pickford should be banned for many games dropped from England squad and VAR is useless and I’m not watching premier league football no more with VAR in use  the ref should go to a screen on side of pitch because who ever is behind var is defo not a ref
1:21 Carra as honest as f**k 💯
I 100% agree with Jamie here. Unfortunately these things happen yes it was a bad tackle but these things happen. And i also agree with him saying we refs should be at stockley park they have that experience
What's up with the old-timey microphone?
It was a clear breakdown of the VAR process as we know it. The VAR team should have simply flagged the tackle to the on-field referee with the instruction that "there is no penalty to be awarded in the event of any identification of violent conduct." That's it. Oliver would have made a decision. At the end of the day,  justice must be seen to be done, and in this case, it was not. There is no accountability with the VAR process.
The same people who genuinely think Pogba is a better footballer than Souness was don’t understand how mad it is if Graeme Souness is saying it’s a bad tackle
The game was dead and it wasn't violent conduct. Correct decision.  People only making a big deal about it because of the injury & because it's LFC
Just because its VVD these guys are going mad
You can be a pundit and still Be a biased towards your old club. This is the reason why we should never have ok players be pundits because they can never be fair. Sourness is mad but he never shows the same energy when calls go again Man U or city or Chelsea or arsenal. Yes it was supposed to be a red card but it wasn’t so now why are you mad ? Be like Jamie, he at least shows fairness. Almost 60% of the pundits on ESPN or other channels are Chelsea or Liverpool players and they are all biased
Roy Keane " It's his Job" 🤣🤣
Carra: "No one goes out of their way to harm players" Souness:  *nervously nods*
Jamie: 99% of players don't wanna hurt other players   Keane: im that 1%
Carra reserves his suggestion for heavy punishment for culprits who caused serious injuries to other players due to his consideration for his past actions and fear for the backlash
I thought Souness said VAR is making the game more interesting with more goals. Now he is against it? Lol
Is anyone having the feeling of deja vu? Laporte tore his ACL around the same time of the season last year. Kompany left City and Lovren left Liverpool before the season to play in their home countries.
Well done JC. Souness sit down.
Should have bring Roy Keane here
Carra you are wrong. No matter it's intentional or not, that Pickford's reckless tackle should always merit a straight red card. Correct me if i am wrong but I've never heard that you can foul someone hard when the ball is out of play... especially that you were only calling it offside retrospectively with VAR - while the whole incident happened with continuity in a play and that's simply a blatant FOUL. Whether those nasty tackles have or not ended no matter Nani or Virgil's career isn't relevant. As a Liverpool fan, my venting is not about 3 points dropped or losing the world's best defender for a season. Just because that VAR call is really really wrong.
well watching Souness moaning about non-Pogba issues... lets just sit back and... hey wait stand up and clap for Jordan Pickford, he has done his part to salvage football and deal out some karma while 107 people have activated their victim complex here
Carragher is jealous of vvd coz vvd is way better than him plus dickford is English . My respect for carragher is gone here on
I am a neutral fan and I initially thought that the VAR was being called for because of the horrendous tackle by Pickford, I was shocked to see that there was no action taken for that tackle even in a Merseyside derby, its not the first time Pickford has made a last ditch dangerous foul either but in general somehow goalkeepers get away with some awful challenges, if that was an outfield player making that challenge its a straight red from the ref, I don't understand how goalkeepers get away with really dangerous challenges, studs up but refs become lenient in some cases because its a goalkeeper...the point is that its a really dangerous challenge no matter who makes it...straight red
How about pundits from Sky and ESPN do VAR then they can go on tv afterwards and explain/defend their decisions and that way the best refs get to stay in the games.
Jamie is fuming bcoz he knows now they're winning another title after 30yrs 😂😂😂
Souness used to try break legs every game one of the dirtiest players i ever saw
We're all having debates when it happened to Van Dijk, where were these debates when Mustafi got kicked in the face? Where were they when Leno's leg got broken?
I think that incident look like an accident. If you ain't sure, let VAR help. Referee in order.
Its a multi billion sports industry ffs...get the best referee on the pitch and in the VAR even if you have to import from somewhere!
These guys are so much more calm then Stephen.A Smith and Max Kellerman😂😂
Mane on Mina Van dijk on James Robertson on Allan These were also nasty tackles deserving of a booking but i guess it doesn't fit your agenda.🙄🙄🙄
I'm a United fan, but I hope VVD recovers quickly.
5:33 TBF all referee in this league SHOULD feel inferior to Michael Oliver. That's how bad the refs are in this league.
Poor Decision
I'm a neutral and have seen pickford do this on many occasions. He does it deliberately. No question. Not in doubt. Should be banned for a long time.
When liverhampton wins: wow what a team, salah was formidable, van dijk was amazing. When they lose or draw: the grass was long, the wind was too much, the field was dry. 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
if pickford didnt get punished because offside happened before that, if thats the reason, if thats the rules of foootball now, then theres a need to change the rules, if its not problem with the rules, if the problem is the refs, then this should never be happened, the premier league is supposed to best league in the world? this is no way acceptable even on another planet
Well done carragher talking sense
Imagine if this could be a career ending injury
Graeme souness belongs to Liverpool TV not sky sports ffs.
Carra is a bluenose.
Sounses F**k off
Look this bastard Southgate how he is crying he know Liverpool is no joke until next seaonn
citys won now from terrible decisions
It’s true, VAR is used stupidly in the Prem, but funny they don’t talk about that with other teams as much rather when it affects LiVARpool, City or United.
Love how some blame VAR when VAR is controlled by human's who are clearly inept at their job hence why there wasn't any English refs at the last World Cup
Simply these Liverpool pundit forget van Dijk takle again Napoli player 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally carragher calling out sourness hypocrisy
Red card, simple.
All credit to Carragher for a well balanced view.. unlike the rest of you mongs.
😂😂😂😂😂
Carra won’t be talking like this if the goalie was not a England player
This VAR none sense has to be sorted out. It’s turning the sport into some cheap copycat of itself.
Awww, poor Jordan Pickford. Glad you got your priorities right, Jamie... ffs
I believe Pickford is an Idiot, but that's not a good reason that he avoided the red card Jamie.
Carra: Oh Behave, Graham lol 😂
Remember VVD is not only done for the season with Liverpool, but also for the Netherlands, if anyone cares.
What about the martial one last week VAR FUCKED THAT ONE UP TOO
Actually even though it was an offside the ref should have at least shown a yellow before the offside was declared . That challenge deserved at least a yellow if not a red
Yea defend your fellow country man
Players go to clatter ppl all the time GK are the main offenders. Jp has went out to clatter him   If you had bernards watch and said jordan in 5 seconds ago you damage virgils acl .... are you gona go out wreckess again he would say no. Intention to clatter - 100% YES Intention to seriously injure - 100% NO Red card? ....1 million % YES
VAR keeps messing up and it takes too long. Better to just call the studio and let the boys make the decisions in seconds.
Graeme Souness was a thug on the pitch and he has some neck slabbering about a supposed 'assault' by anyone.
I won't be watching or supporting England while Pickford is in goal.
It's not about having the best referees, the referees on the pitch should take the time and effort to view all VAR incidents pitchside and not hide behind VAR at Stockley Park.
Liverpool fans still want the real Madrid final replayed for the foul on salah 🤣
Is Jamie shaving his moustache with the mic or wtf lol
Allow the referee on the field to use the VAR on field to make decisions like the NFL
I like souness crying nowadays he has shifted his attention from pogba
Jamie Carragher doesn't get it . . Souness is talking  about VAR  and Carragher  is talking about linch mobs and creating a bigger issue . . Shouldn't put Carragher on TV.
The referees at the recent Women's World Cup adapted well to using the VAR field monitor and made the final decisions themselves on the field. I'm not sure why EPL refs couldn't do the same, do their job and take charge of the match.
Again just shows why refs should check the pitch side monitor
What is carragher smoking? no one is out to hurt anyone that’s for sure. However back then we don’t have VAR. Lost all respect for this guy. bad challenge should be red carded and punished. End of story. Rules are rules.
Carragher has totally missed the point . . . Souness is on it.
Jamie stop being a jackass bad tackling does happen in the game . All we want is whenever it happens that the culprit is punished simple. Bottom line is Pickford should’ve been sent off which is the job of the referee who was poor.
Never thaught I'd agree with Jamie it was a shocking tackle and should have been a red card the most blame goes to var
Bring back Clattenburg in the VAR
Graeme “If I do it it’s okay” Souness
Graeme Souness telling off someone for “not doing their job” is incredibly ironic given his punditry “expertise”
Oh my words... Roy kean the dirtiest player ever played in the PL talking about pickford's challenge and intentions... Faaaack offfff
Pickford is off the ground, out of control and to cap it all he’d done a scissor movement. Yes, I understand he wanted to make his self big, but does that include that scissor move? Same as Richarlison's  tackle on Thiago, it was intended. Even the way the whole Everton team play that day was too robust.
Get this old man off television, jeez what a bad pundit.
VAR isnt the problem its the refs who still make the last call so you might aswell scrap it and go back to before VAR because after that match i honestly don't see the point in it anymore
PICKFORD SHOULD BE BANNED FOR THE SEASON,,, VVD I HOPE HE RECOVERS
They should go live to VAR studio and let people see how they make their decisions then will know what’s going off.
We should try a no slow motion replay rule.  The officials need to watch the replays repeatedly at full speed. Let's see how that goes, because sat the moment it seems the slow-mo replays are skewing the judgement of these officials.  Slow motion replays make hand balls look worse and bad tackles look less bad.
Farley tv going to smash this impression out the water!! Jamie just making it easy for him cant wait!!!!
Souness was a player who assaulted many players ,  He would not last in the game today Pickford is a mentally unbalanced and should be banned. He should be sold.
The 1% who do it on purpose is Roy Keane
Carra: “I believe 99% of professional players will not try and hurt someone”  Keane: “nonsense”
VAR=Match fixing.
Pickford is a coward. Injures Virgil then runs to Hendo to ask him to apologize to Virgil on his behalf. He could've apologized to Virgil's face himself but he didn't at the time cuz he didn't care! Your apology isn't sincere if you don't give it yourself.
it's was a piss poor tackle BUT the rules meant the ref couldn't give it. violent conduct they could have but a reckless tackle that happened after the offside they cannot. the rules shud be changed such that it could be a red even after the offside (altho it can't be a pen coz technical the ball wasn't live, due to the game having to be brought back for the offside).
Have alot of respect for Jamie as pundit
SCRAP VAR
Stop moaning bad challenge yes ,remember gerrards two footed stamp on Naismith never even got booked by his mate mark
Yeah it’s terrible but by the rule book if it’s offside then nothing else is counted. So it’s not the refs fault. They need to change the rules
I reckon it's less than 99% Carragher... How you come up with those statistics??
Nigh on.
He's never liked Everton that souness or sourness in my opinion.
Don’t understand why Michael Oliver, one of the best “young” referees in the game, even before VAR has been introduced, doesn’t have a look. You look at old timers like mike dean who probably makes the same call, stop and possibly  will put his “old timer’s pride” to the side and at least have a debate with the refs in stochley park. God bless Virgil hopefully a speedy recovery!
Been looking forward to this!!!!
Sourness probably thinks it’s pogba’s fault
U can’t go in to a tackle with the two leg twist like that, he didn’t even try to get the boy and he wrap the leg around VVD leg
That 1% is Roy Keane?
team souness
It's so amusing to watch souness crying.
Respect Jamie even more today
In every other top league in the world, the referee on the pitch 9/10 goes to the monitor pitch side and looks at the clip, ultimately making the final decision. Why is this not a thing in this league where the referees are THE WORST out of all?
Latest score :  Petty Rules 5  Common Sense 0   ( Who has decided that because it’s offside it doesn’t matter? )
Carra is such a fool.
That guy was so composed in he answer what a great answer that was, where as souness is so biased.
Jamie can’t say anything about not going out of his way to hurt someone did you see what he did to joeweller😂
"oh behave Graeme" From a United fan Jamie is cut from different cloth, talks sense.
You could put the so called "best" referees in stockley park to run var but it probably wouldn't make a difference. The bottom line is that the standard of English referees has dropped massively over recent years. Their ineptitude has been highlighted frequently when they can't even make correct decisions while looking at var replays. How many English referees were part of the last world cup?
I jus saw some of the tackles Graeme souness did ,they were absolutely filthy. He should not even have a verdict here
They're watching something else ... V A R  (Virtual Augmented Reality)
Whats up with Carraghers eyes????
What coat is jamie carragher wearing?
Yh it was a bad challenge but souness acting like he didn’t make these type of challengers in his day
Best point in this video is Carra’s suggestion of having ex-refs doing the VAR.
06:00 BANG ON
Liverpool fans upset of vvd getting a torn acl or whatever it was but son literally broke someone’s foot the other way but no one wanted son to get banned 🤔
I think it's a great idea. The old referees should be making those VAR decisions not the moron who was in front of monitor Saturday
Liverpool fanboys upset their only chance of winning the prem is gone 😭😭😭😢
cara is right 99% of them dont want to injure someone that bad.
So its ok for the ref to blow the final whistle and then give a penalty to a team afterwards.   That challenge was horrendous and Pickford should've got a red. He didnt make his body big like Carra said. He went in with a scissor tackle.
Pickford needs to watch out. Karma could possibly give him cancer in the near future.
Easy fix.  Only ACTUAL Premier League referee's should be in control of VAR and there should also be a jury to vote on the decisions that are too close to rely on technology for.   The eye is the only judge that should count... Anything else is blatant corruption of the sport as well as the mind. There is no shame in the authorities of football anymore just like the government. It's a farce as there is absolutely no way these thing's can be happening unless they're purposely hiring lower league referee's to ridicule Premier league referee's by over ruling them and stealing the beautiful game.   Guess we've found out why David Coote never made it to referee at Premier League level before VAR was introduced. Now he's called the shots on 30 PL games including the biggest fixtures and he's funnily enough missed some other obvious red card scenario's. Apparently he got dropped for a week after his last mistake. VAR should be dropped to league 2 for the rest of the season and see how many headlines they make then. Give us our game back or at least let us watch it for free during this experimental new game disguised as football.
It doesn't matter what happens after the offside decision, it was the first decision.
It’s a bad tackle but souness Is the biggest hypocrite plus he was one saying years ago how refs are poor and getting decisions wrong. Although it’s not perfect because it will never be but decisions have be more correct than ever and var has corrected decisions that would never had 3 years before. If you take var away there will be complaints that when var would of saved a team they will be crying for it back it’s not perfect it’s gotten a lot better since last year but 95% of the time it works. If bar wasn’t there they still would of missed the red so why does it even matter in the end you all would be crying anyway. (to clarify I think it was a red) var works if you don’t like the rules of offside complain to the rule makers not the refs when decisions are wrong blame the refs NOT VAR
Believe it or not Pickford did that intentionally just as Richarlison did to Thiago Everton came out yesterday thinking Liverpool would have been a walk over but when they realized that it wasn’t so they resorted to dark magic football that is to say win by any means necessary
This is the exact same situation with Son and Gomes 2 years ago. Son didn't mean to break his leg in that challenge but it happened and Son ultimately got a red. Its simple..... Consistency in the decisions and refereeing.
Pickford was a disgrace.  That's a killer tackle.  He needs banning
Funny how they’re only just crying about it now because one of the big boys was on the receiving end of it.   It’s been shite from day 1.
mICHEAL OLIVER is the worst referee in the premier league
Both Thiago and VVD were fouled in the same manner. This is a pre planned situation which is called common intention to cause hurt. They have discussed before the match. See the replay with both of your eyes, if you think it isn't red card, meet me up now and i'll do that slide to your leg and we shall discuss further.
Carra for one of the very few times making a good /fair argument
it was a dead red card.lets just leave it at that.
Can't believe I agree with Carra for once.
Ffs mr souness, as i rangers fan i loved you, thought you were one of the best midfielders id seen, even before you came to Rangers, but please dont talk about pickford and an assault, because on many occasions i saw you do much worse,  i was season ticket at Rangers and you brutalised players
Bringing old refs in to be the refs behind VAR is an absolute shout from Carra. Love that!
I think the officials have their heads so stuffed with new rules they can't see straight.
Souness ''VAR is a tool'' nuff said.
Martial got sent off for a flick on Lamela's chin. Pickford scissors Van Dijk's knee and no action is taken. Honestly rediculous.
Graeme Souness I can agree with 100%
This is like if a cop mistakenly stops a driver for speeding and the driver shoots that cop. The driver gets away free despite shooting the cop because he wasn’t speeding.
Is VAR made in China????because VAR invented in China right???don't last and always broke..all equipment is made in China !!!the FA is good friend with China.
I wish the people behind VAR would at least come out and explain their decisions or apologize for them.
PoliTics PoliTricks
Souness : "We all know the blame is on Pickford and the Refs, BUT don't let this distract you from the fact that Paul Pogba is the real problem."
Can someone tell me is grahame sounded has been to Stockley park in the pad 18 months?
I'm glad VAR wasn't around when carra n Gerrard played, 2 of the cheapest, dirtiest players about.  they werent tough just cheap. At least souness who was also dirty was at least tough.
Jamie talks shite.   Referee on the pitch had perfect view. stop excuses.
VAR (video assistant referee) as ye all know, should be a video on the sideline to assist the IN MATCH REFEREE. Not some other clown in a box somewhere else in the country that has no feel for the game. It should be up to the referee of that match to view the footage in full speed and slow motion on the touch line from each angle to make the decision. Until that happens, every team in the league will have lost or gained points on the expense of the opposition... it was created to make the game fair but has been either too fair or too unfair depending on what side your on. NO BALANCE
That mic is something out of the 1960s no need at all.
Pickfords challenge was worse than Richarlisons yet the lesser incident was punished. How can Carra defend such a horrendous tackle?
Souness one of the dirtiest players ive ever seen.
6:00 Souness going after that dummie Peter Walton 🤣
Sourness calling that tackle outrageous is just a mockery of all and everything.
New rule then.. Any player willing to take the risk of applying violent conduct must spend the same time out as the person they injure... we'd soon see that clear up 99% of the time.
Listening to these two it sounds like you're not allowed to challenge liverpool players
This has turned into a witch hunt on behalf of a multi-million dollar investment.   A more affordable player on a middling team would have never garnered this attention.  Pickford swing at the ball with his left leg, (he missed,) the point being, demonstrably not malicious. Both players were moving towards the ball at speed. Time was, not so long ago, the box belonged to the goalie. Had Pickford gone in with his hands with his head at foot level we'd be seeing this the other way round. Well, maybe not because IT'S LIVERPOOL  All in all it was an unfortunate collision and a player got hurt.  I didn't feel Son deserved a red card for Gomes' broken leg last season either.  This is a contact sport where elitist investments are now encouraged and rewarded, even COACHED for flopping and diving.  And now VAR.  This game's being ruined by money
This grandad did worse challenges in his career than that and look at him protect the players clown
I don't like Jamie's mic lmao but pray for VVD
Why can’t Graeme just be agreeable for once
Jamie Carragher, you should be ashamed of yourself. Two wrongs don't make a right. It's very coincidental that two of our best players get taken out by two talentless thugs. The second tackle doesn't happen if Pickford gets sent off. Why aren't these two thugs being called out for trying to end the career of their fellow professionals? No FA ban for the thug Pickford?
Yup we gonna talk about how Pickford unintentionally made a tackle on VVD and make him the culprit and completely ignore the fact that VVD almost wrecked Mertens ankle last season and still wasn't sent off and then he had the audacity to say it was nothing when asked about. Have some shame Loserpool twats.
Where was this passion when van dijk tackled mertens and it was a definite red 😂
The game is fixed - simple - with VAR - you can sway the results
Graeme went to Stockley Park
Reckless tackle by Pogba
Graham souness is such a biased person always  for liverpool and does not look at football game. Fair it was a bad challenge. If was united player whom got tackled like that than he would of said, this football you have make challenges like that ( ie it's a man sport etc ) such a flippin joker. All these years his been angry man. One thing is liverpool luck is running out typical liverpool fan
it was offside.
They've ruined football like they've ruined everything else, based on nothing but phoney science, biased experts and nonsense technology that doesn't work.
So let me get this straight. Souness starts off by calling Pickford’s tackle an assault. A couple of minutes later he agrees with Jamie that he didn’t deliberately do Van Dijk. 1-0 to Carragher.
VAR OUT!!
Has souness not given up with this yet, such a moaning bar stool
I hate scouser commentators,  don't speak the Queens.
Has souness watched the “assaults” he made back
This man Souness is a biatch.
Intentional or not. Both Richarlson and T-Rex were both straight reds. Utter disgraceful referring and officiating. Its embarrassing the money and technology used to assist these refs and they can't even do that right.
Remember what Ramos did to Salah ? Was that not part of the 99,99% Unintentional tackles ?
I doubt any neutral would be demanding for Pickford to be banned.
Even the 'best' referee can be bought ...
Micheal Oliver is the worst referee
Souness: Pogba should be ashamed of Pickfords tackle
when it's var the camera should cut to the studio where there deciding. so we can hear exactly how and why they are making that decision. LIKE to get this comment more notice.
Souness is one to speak after his tackle on Siggi Jonsson.
Souness is correct the tackle was prioty over the offside even a blindman could see that was a reckless tackle...
Darren Moore 🥰
"Professional footballers dont go out to hurt anyone"  Sorry did you not watch Pepe from Real Madrid?
What is VAR for? It is making the job of the referee impossible. If referees make mistakes so what? Who doesn't? Pay them more if you want more competence. We've been through this rubbish in the NRL. Carragher is an idiot.
One is a Liverpool legend and the other gobs at children.
So according to Carragher, no player tries to deliberately hurt others? Richarlison on Thiago was a horrific tackle. He hadn't had a sniff all game, he played like shite, he was frustrated and he has a history of being a dirty bastard and he flew into Thiago studs up knee height in the final minutes of the game, faked an injury and then proceeded to throw his toys out the pram when he got deservedly sent off and didn't even check to see if Thiago was alright, at least Pickford had the decency to check on Van Dijk.
Carra is a disgrace here talking shite
On a serious note... i genuinely think VAR forgot to inform the ref regarding the tackle...
"the tackles you did" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Utd fan I wanna see Liverpool lose but that was an awful "tackle" on VVD & it was never offside. You wanna see the best players so I hope VVD makes a quick recovery
Souness has no right to speak about wreakless challenges
Sourness used to do these tackles every day
Based take from Carragher here. Bad tackle but not a bannable offence.
What is Carra doing there defending Pickford? From a professional perspective and from a rival perspective theres no way to say that was not a bad challenge It was nasty! Stop acting like a fair guy here, u should condemn Pickford like Souness did! Never like Carragher as a Liverpool fans and this is just stupid!
Carra talks serious shite sometimes gone a crap pundit for me
Haha - "the tackles you did" well done Carra, well said.
why is Jamie telling him to ''oh behave''
Get over it, Van Dijk was laying a marker down on every Everton player minutes before that incident. Injuries are part of the game, Liverpool fans loved VAR last season. Such a travesty that they only have 6 more world class players to carry them through this season.
"chef-er-ee" 0:38 0:42 0:45
When souness calls it an assault you know it’s bad fs souness usto try kill celtic players haha loved him for it though haha
Sounasss....  hates everton
Souness is full of B.S ......hahaha nice one Pickford good luck on ya fella well deserved pint 🍺 he’s useless and no one really listen to him ......sky sports should get rid of him please
I dont get it... Many players are injured is fine and liverpool defender got injured is a massive problem 🙄
That's football
Liverpool fans ever since I've followed football have always had a victim mentality. They go strangely quiet when decisions go in their favour. The second one goes against them, they want retribution.
Shitford is another overated player who will get a pass from refs & media alike... cos  hes English!!
Liverpool fans, how did the seamus coleman song go when he broke his leg?? How's big virgil??
Souness was a thug who once broke a players jaw. Hypocrite.
Let’s be honest it was a red but still Liverpool have no right to use that as an excuse they should still be good enough to win the game
I dislike souness with a passion.
Reckon souness would be as bothered if it was the other way round? Not a chance. Get him off sky sports the kopite
Each team should have someone next to the var refs to protest decisions live
0:55 Jamie....this game also can decide the league for Liverpool for only one point like 2018-2019 season..... The rules needs to be rewiew in the right way to make the people happy and not angry and frustrated!
I just don't get why refs don't check the monitor? Why are the linesmen not left in charge and only over ruled in a clear and obvious error?
Souness was much quicker to defend the VAR with handball rule the past few weeks.   Can’t help but feel if this was Alison on Pogba he’d be defending VAR saying it’s not a red.   Hope virg recovers quickly - from a United fan.
5:40 Sitendee😂
Love when Ex-Liverpool players get wound up. They’re a different breed of sore loser altogether. Souness is the same guy who ended a mans career and tried to cripple many others. I One of the dirtiest to play the game. Him saying it was a different era when he played is just bullshit. He’s saying that simply because he knows he was an animal on the pitch.
Carragher: I don’t think a player intends a bad tackle  Richalison: hold my shitty knock off r9 trim
what happened to jamie’s eyes
I find it hard to believe that pickford didn't try to do VVD tbh,,, but perhaps we should give him the benefit of the doubt
Look at where his eyes are looking end of.
In Rugby the TMO is used to help and assist a referee during a game. A referee will explain what he has seen and what action should be taken, if the referee has omitted a part of play that he does not seem important then the TMO will advise a referee to look at a passage of play again and then both the referee and TMO agree on the action to be taken, maybe this can explained to everyone using VAR???
Souness is literally not in any position to talk about assault on a football pitch. He was a dirty horrible bastard on the pitch himself
Souness knows what a bad tackle is ....and he thinks this is a very bad tackle !
Lol carra lad sorry your talking shite mate, in the days of sourness they did try to kick lumps out of each other. And if you seriously don't think referees have no allegiances your losing the plot lad.
Rich from one of the dirtiest players to have played the game
So Jamie is just going to pretend he didn't purposefully break Alan Smiths leg and nearly end his career
Jamie Carragher ' I dont think anyone goes out of their way deliberately to hurt someone'  'Roy Keane with a steely glare towards Jamie'
It's amazing how biased Sky is to United and Liverpool, whenever something like this happens to their clubs. They have to talk about it for hours and say action needs to happen. But the other clubs don't get this kind of protection.
Intentional or not but it was a horrible tackle from Pickford and he should be penalized for it. And I agree with Souness, the offside call is ridiculous.
Souness at 6:00 is spot on! Peter Walton in particular is as useful as a chocolate fireplace. So spineless, makes none of his own opinions just sucks up to var.
Souness 😂😂
Butt hurt loserpool pundits LMAO
Michael Oliver the best referee!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They should use VAR like the NFL uses the red flag. A manager can challenge a call or goal once per game, then VAR is used as a tool to make a judgement.
shut up Jamie
souness is such a neek 😂
VAR was brought in to help with clear and obvious errors, this is microscopic, every goal if there 0.02mm offside the goal is not given, whilst the correct decision has been made but it’s not a clear and obvious error, I agree with Graeme it’s making referees look stupid, they’re job is hard enough already, the VAR official should only be consulted if the referee in stockley park believe the referee on the pitch has made a CLEAR AND OBVIOUS error not because his big toe nail is offside, this isn’t a defence of Liverpool after they were unlucky yesterday this is many decisions, sterling’s goal opening day last season, Sheffield United against Spurs last season, Declan rice handball last minute against Sheffield United, none of those clear and obvious
100% red personally I think it’s onside and 100% a pen.  Pickford should get a atleast a 5 game ban
it was a bad tackle it was unfortunate that Van Dijk got hurt badly but it happens in this sport and it was never a sending off
You don't tackle someone like that with no intent to hurt them. Disgusting from Pickford
Sourness does Carra in a straightener even from that far away
VAR why always me.
You don't need to be a ref or even understand football to see it was a straight red. Are the people running VAR just straight up moron's?
I think Souness should have been put into a sound-proofed booth for this discussion,like they used to do on Mr & Mrs. Then brought on at the end to see if he could guess what the others had said. After his entire career trying to break one opponent's leg per game, his opinion isn't worth a damn.
I didn't find any constructive comments here all are commedy.
wtf is going on with that mic
Pickford deserves a 6 game ban.
2 ex reds talking about the Merseyside Derby on sky.. consider me shocked!
Darren. So original. So profound.
I normally don't mind Carragher but he is being an absolute bellend with his comments here.
Pot kettle black Sourness,worst pundit on TV, carragher gone up in my opinion telling him to behave 🤣
The ref make the decison base on the rules, once he's off side then the outcome is simple if it's not purpose..
I'm with Graeme saying that the offside call is secondary call but also I think that if the player interferes in play when in an offside position, he is offside.
Well Liverpool fans, karma can definitely haunt. When City got screwed by VAR last season at Anfield, no liverpool fan cares. But when a VAR decision goes against them. OHHHHHHHH ITS A DISGRACE. Well maybe it is time u take a taste of ur own medicine. What u made fun of City for comes back to bite. Last season we had defensive problems,injuries,VAR messing up, losing games. And now u guys are getting what City had last season. Karma truly is a b-
It wasn’t malicious derek it was just clumsy
Assault on the player? Give me a break Souness.
There's nothing wrong with the technology. The fault lies with incompetent officials like _David Coote,_ a repeat offender for whose egregious errors his fellow referees and _PGMOL_ prefer to make excuses rather than acknowledge learn lessons and implement them to improve. English refereeing is in the business of abetting and condoning mediocrity and rank incompetence.
World War 2 microphone
From being just outside of relegation last season to being second with a game in hand.
Carragher is deluded
Carra is right but Pickford's challenge was beyond reckless.
Carragher made a point of ex players and why can't ex players be making decisions as other sports do and it seems football is several years stuck in the past and it needs a shake up and quickly,p.s hope the layer gets well soon.
It’s not red card
Fake YouTube content. Which sky are doing more and more.
imagine if the tackle was on someone else other than van dijk . for example minamino or salah their leg would have been snapped
Souness is wanting the authorities to put Pickford behind bars haha
Get Dermot Gallagher down at Stockley Park
Pickford..the mad SMB!
Pure English favouritism from carra. Carra  needs to get this out of his punditry
Roy Keane: GOT THE BALL REF!!!!!
Souness is right. VAR is a great tool. English refs are just too bad to use it properly
The world is up in arms cos a decision finally goes against the scousers dear oh dear.
Bad challenge is one  Pickford might of panicked  But he went in him like lui kang  Regardless who u favour coming back from an acl is a long road and possibly career changing not everyone gets back 100%
VAR is a tool lol
Souness is an idiotic analyst. He ignored his own tackles, called it an assault, and then says he doesn't think Pickford wanted to injure, his point on VAR is it's impossible to make a mistake, but this is a mistake.
If this injury was on another defender it wouldn't even be a talking point.
Dont see why football cant do what rugby does every week go through the games and hand bans out on the seriousness of the foul. A player getting sent off for stopping a goal scoring chance should not get the same ban as a player getting sent off for a leg breaking tackle
I never thought I would say this but I think Graeme Souness is 100% correct. He is spot on. Carragher on the other hand is completely detached from reality. How can Carragher see nothing wrong with that tackle?  I do not like seeing Pundits with fraudulent backgrounds like Jamie Carragher. Once a Toffee forever a Toffee.
The Pickford tackle was worse than than the tackle on Thiago by far
Robinson kicking allan trying to injure him not being mentioned or foing to var makes all these comments moot
It was a foul no thought but the offside overrules the decision for Pickford to be sent off .Those are the rules.
I am  red jamie carragher is talking nonsense the game has gone to pot
And pogba! he was texting pickford the night before carra
Good point by carragher: The tackles sounness did were horrific... even when HE had possession
Jamie is wrong about Pickford or Richarlison not being intentional about their fouls. It is a problem in the coaching and mentality of the club, which is Everton. How come two players make career ending challenges in the same game on two of the best players of Liverpool ? Why isn’t anyone talking about that ?
mic nose therapy?
Yeah if it was say Allison instead of Pickford no one would care, it's so funny how much bias there is towards Liverpool
Sourness you sad pathetic old man
can sky sports get carra a bit of water the  fellas always got ghandi's
Assaults are premeditated and usually the assailant doesnt apologise immediately after
Graeme was really focused on the face he went to Stockley Park a few months ago
Oh I can't stand Carra anymore. What he is talking about english refferes are good and Oliver is the best one. Come one now. They're one of the worst in world football. No one was selected  for WC18  or Euro16 to take charge of anygame.
Graeme knows the title is gone
Jamie is right. It was a goalkeeper tackle. I`m a Gers fan, Souness did a lot worse.
Jamie- “I don’t think a player goes out of there way to hurt a player” Roy-“You sure about that one Jamie?”
Our main player is out whole season or maybe his career is also over and you guys talking about red card and offside. We all know that pickford did it on purpose.
Souness sounding like Joe Biden
Fair play to Carragher Souness  ...
carra tackled his nanny..      must have been a weird night
Pickford should of gotten a red, plain and simple. You could of possibly ruined another man's career, that's not what football is about.
Funny thing is, how easy they can defend Pickford and his crazy tackles on the other side they can listen all day when this old man moaning on Pogba.   Bravo Jamie stop him otherwise he’ll be talking about Pickford the rest of the season or every time Liverpool looses it’ll be Pickford fault.
PICKFORDS probably happy with what hes done to vvd
Liverpool physio staff irresponsible.
Here to read Pogba comments lol
Not one of us Liverpool fans want to see Pickford suspended here, if anything he should be forced to play every game for the rest of the season ;)
Darren Moore is class to have on the panel
Swear I was waiting on Souness to accidentally say that was a reckless challenge from Pogba I mean Paul, sorry I mean Pickford.
Carragher: I don't think any footballer goes out of there way to hurt a player  Roy Keane:Nonsense!!
Carra it doesnt matter if he didnt mean to, going in like that with a scissor motion never gonna be good
This injury is so peak for Liverpool they’re dun out ere without Van Dijk😭😭😭😭 they can say bye to the title without him there it’s gunna be the exact same thing when City lost Laporte last season🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Gomez n Matip are good defenders but neither of them are commanding like VVD they’re both 2nd CB picks rather than being the first choice one❌🧢 as much as it’s easy to say Pickford did it on purpose he acts crazily like this every time a player is near him in the box🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ also I agree with avatar these things do happen in football but ofc it was a horrendous tackle n Pickford should’ve got a red👍🏾👍🏾
It's sad that so many people on anti-social media actually seem happy that Van Dijk has got a serious injury. I expect it from Everton fans though, after all, big Dunc, their hero that they worship, and first team coach got jailed for headbutting a fellow professional. And they will justify the foul by bringing up a decision that happened 20 years ago no doubt.
Michael Oliver is atrocious!! He is no way the best referee!! He's preety trash!
Pickford vs. Van Dijk was just a freak accident - I've seen much worse tackles with no injuries caused.
VAR. Your a tool.
The irony of liverpool fans complaining about var when var went there way  all last season
1:10 whys he using that dumb staticky unclear mic for
It’s crazy that Pickford got away with it just because of a off-side. He should still have been sent off, and even liverpool have a penalty, the point is it still actually happened, VVD still got injured. It’s crazy
Pickford got away with atrocious,horrendous tackle on VVD!.He got away from sanction by Michael Oliver probably coz of Albion kith &kin!.There is a reason why FIFA overlooked English referees 4 RUSSIA 2018!
It’s really amusing when Souness was talking about Pickford’s reckless challenge, when he used to kick anything that moved.
At least carragher hasn't gobbed at anyone tonight.
This is the only sport that can't use VAR properly 🙄 Rugby League use putting players on report if they can't sort out a dodgy tackle. Works well like the VAR  does.
Joe Weller wouldn’t agree with what ur saying
Why do you need VAR fools to invite the ref to look at the video monitor? Surely the referee should be the one in control and should go pitchside to have a look at the monitor himself if he’s missed something. whoever has picked these idiots to sit in front of the monitors and draw lines to see if a finger is offside needs sacking as it’s spoilt such a beautiful game. VAR has taken over football for the wrong reasons! It’s a bloody farce!
If Souness says it’s a bad challenge it must be bad. He dished out some seriously bad tackles in his day.
Instead of using VAR to check offsides, why not just have a pitch side camera on the offside line. So much easier
Pickford always panicking  Never preparing to react to plays  Only overreacting to danger  3 games for that
No I remember Pickford against Tottenham he almost break Harry Kane legs last season
the god damn commentators all see it, and call it, literally every single poor decision. You dont need qualified refs, just anybody who understands the basics of football
Souness was the dirtiest player ever !
They agreed... it was a red card tackle where Pickford didn't mean to hurt VVD. Stupid title.
What a cheeky bastards this fella used to slaughter fellow footballers on the pitch!
In every other sport retrospective action is an option for something that is missed or something that was misjudged on the field by the referee. He should at least be given a red card after the fact. Even if it is after the game or now a few days later. It’s just  lunacy that this is their decision. Suarez   bit a guy that the ref didn’t see, and was punished after the game and rightly so. It was a weird animalistic thing to do but in terms of injury. What happened the other day was actually more serious to the player. Intent or not. Not intending to break the rules isn’t an excuse for breaking the rules
Cara : With the tackles you did, face of disgust 😂😂😂
I disagree with souness, I think it was nion impossible to make a mistake!
For Souness to talk about poor challenges is beyond hypocrisy . He went out to injure opponents deliberately .
I think Pickford knew exactly what he was doing, how can you two foot someone like that and not expect to injure them? He had a big smirk on his face as well the little prick
40 match ban imo. That was a shocker, not even mad at him just the referees can’t believe he wasn’t sent off.
Liverpool always the victims
Mike Dean to Carragher “Am I a joke to you”😂
David had a good and calm viewpoint of this scenario. Liked his input. Definitely bring him on more
Hey now we’ll see if it’s true that Liverpool were “so good” that they could win without VVD. Their cocky fans and the homer pundits couldn’t understand for the life of them how losing Laporte (City’s VVD) for almost the whole season, their best winger in Sane the entire season, and Aguero for four months could derail a title defense. They’re one key injury to Mane or Salah from missing the top four. Karma is a b*tch.
Sourness is fuming hahaha liverpool bin dippers complaining about VAR how rich hahahaha
Funny that Souness, probably, the dirtiest filthiest english player in last 40-50 years, who saw football pitch as his fighting ground and whined about modern players being pussies, now complaining about reckless tackles when it's against Liverpool. lol.
Michael Oliver is NOT a top Ref
Could someone please let me know how Graeme Souness is still employed as a pundit? Awful.
But you don't mind gobbing on a kid do ya carra?
Wtf is Souness on about, he was out to murder his opponents when he played.
I disagree with Carragher. Is that because he is English? Same for Henderson who came out saying PRICKford apologized. Ref are there to protect players .. Who cares what you did Carra? This was a career breaking tackle and same for tackle on Thiago.
Still not had the answer why Michael Oliver deemed it OK to allow a player to make this sort of challenge.  Outfield player does this, players will be windmilling each other
Jamie is right, I like his perspective of he knows what it's like to make a challenge and you feel horrible. He'd definitely want to shut up his fellow LFC supporters that are sending in petitions because that's just stupid.  And the refs are useless anyway, not a single ref on a PL pitch or in a van are any good imo. Var is making a mockery of the game. Its supposed to give us clarity, not confusion.
David Coote has agenda against Liverpool, man needs to be investigated seriously..
I don’t think this issue was a VAR one. I actually think they were aware of the rule and didn’t know how to enforce it in real time.
Totally agree with Graeme
Carra : 'i couldn't sleep thinking about ending a fellow professional's career' Keane : 'I wrote a book'
Pickford needs to be drop
Var is a bad episode of black mirror
Van bastard dijk did dirty on mertens soooooo now he knows taste of his own medecine
Retrospective punishment in this scenario doesn't help Liverpool much. The bottom line is that VAR was brought in to remove controversy and it's only increased it. It has to go. I was against it from the start and all my worst fears have come to fruition and then some. Utter modern inanity. Trial by TV. I'm just amazed they don't throw decisions open to the audience. Get rid.
I remember when luke shaw broke his leg, the guy who broke his leg diddnt even get a caution nevermind a red. It was a daft decision but after the game it was forgotten about. Liverpool fans tho will go on about this for years to come now
My number 1🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
fuk van dijk
Well done Carragher, that boy hoodblue deep with in you showing lad. Pickford's gone to half volley the ball and misjudged if you look closeley.
Do people understand that emotion in football is dying? You cant celebrate goals anymore like we used to without fearing of retarded idiots miles away from football ground that are drawing lines. Football without emotion is nothing, stop killing beautiful game.
Souness is a dinosaur
Recharlison tackle was unbelievable
That 'tackle' is enough to make a WWF crowd scream out in shock and look away in horror!!! It's almost as if the referee has rewarded Pickford for that challenge. He not only injured Liverpool's best player and put him out of the game, but he is then allowed to stay on the pitch, make three or four goal-stopping saves, and even get pulled out of the shi t  at the end by disallowing a goal that he allowed to squirm under his arm. It really is incredible the amount of mistakes these refs are making, not only on the pitch, but in Stockley Park.
Reckless challenge deliberately challenged
HEATED debate
Come on Graham let’s live in the real world . Last year Liverpool had the rub of the greens. When Son  almost ended Gomes career it lasted about two days because Son cried that was the end of that. The Ref left him on I don’t think he did it on purpose he is not that bright. This is football things happen
Pickford should be banned & fined for endangering an opponent.
The truth is liverpool fans are only getting loud about it now is beacause van dijk got injured, if he was fine that tackle would have been forgotten about now.
What is Carr actually talking about i dont get this, yesterday was different from what you did to Nani its not even close to this
Carragher is no red, absolute bitter blue gobshite nowadays
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUNNIEST VIDEO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Greame should be quite because he assaulted many players back in his day. For those who don't know youtube this thug of a football player he was disgusting back in the day. He should sit there and be humble he is making the most noise and he did way worse.
English ref applying rules for foreigner players only period they covered up his mistake bcz he is bloody English goal keeper
Souness is right. Premier League needs foreign referees now. English referees are a joke.
Pickford should be punished must be banned from all competitions for at least two months if it was the other way around Virgil would be punished and also if it was Mario Balotelli he would have to leave the league.
Pickford, I'm coming for you . I have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If say sorry to Virgil that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don’t, I will look for you, I will find you and I will throw a milkshake over you.
I'm with Graeme on this you don't even have to be a referee to know that was a red card
Nobody cares
Even as a United fan, I really rate Carragher as a pundit
CARRAGHERS ON THE BAG!!!!
You don't need the best ref in the booth !!  You just need a guy with eyes to see that terrible scene, Virgil's foot bent the wrong way, to tell the ref: "look at this situation on the screen"! I could have done that !!
Great result for Everton good look to VDD hope he ok
Carragher and Souness make great points but the simple fact is one is talking about after the game and the other is talking about during the game.
Every time I look at Carra I really see Darren Farley 🤔
Souness is right, especially about former referees on TV not being honest and brave enough to admit blatant mistakes by current referees (06:00)
Souness talking about assault!?🤣🤣 him one of the dirtiest players to step onto a pitch....
Jamie’s idea of having retired refs in the VAR booth is the best idea I’ve heard...
When souness says its assault  you listen. Even carra called him out on his past lol.
Some decisions go in your favor, others go against you. Same for injuries. That's how it goes. Deal with it. City had Laporte and Sane last season. KDB missed half of the games the season before that. Did Liverpool fans have sympathy for that? I doubt it. Btw, it was Trent who injured Sane.
Assault? That's pretty rich coming from Souness who used to be a thug on the pitch. Even Carragher finds it ridiculous!
people are only saying it's a red card in light of the seriousness of the injury. goalkeepers ALWAYS tackle like mad men; that's what they do.
Best league in the world! My hole! I’m not watching the premier league anymore, until VAR STOPS ruining the game we love
If that had been a striker on Pickford it would have been a straight red and a massive ban. That call is a joke.
My god, what is Jamie holding there.. Sky Sports out there picking 80 yo microphones from the museum.
Says one of the dirtiest players ever
Who saw Jamie carragher in the charity game?🤣😬
pickford is schitgarbage
What Jamie C is going on about, it was wrong by anyone standerd and those ppl run VAR are just useless, stupid, and servicing their own interest
I'm from America and the refs always look at the monitor in the sports here and make the decision themselves. Idk why people in a remote location do it
All us Everton fans are praying Pickford gets a 10 match ban.
VAR = Virtual ASSISTANT Referee. Its their to assist the referee on the pitch. Ref's should be made to go to the screen when VAR is in use/ is being used. VAR is making decisions and over ruling the referee when its made to assist. Like if you agree.
Players need to be punished for nasty tackles so that every knows it’s not tolerated, if Pickford gets away with it then players will potential start putting in nastier tackles
Notice how quick souness gives his point yet carragher takes about 3 or 4 minutes of waffling to give his point
I think we need to reprimand the players so that they play safer. Pickford was and is such an aggressive player on the pitch I would not like to play with him or against him
Its time for Gomez and Matip to take step up and assume responsibility and probably it is a blessing in disguise for them...So u never know
Carragher showing why he’s a brilliant unbiased pundit, Souness showing the exact opposite. Yes its a red card for Pickford but bore off talking about assault.
Why can the players get a red card in half time and not for offcide
Anywhere else on the pitch and that's a sending off and maybe some violent conduct charge. Breath on a GK and its usually a foul. The inconsistency is maddening. Pickford's a wacko and he did exactly what Lewis Dunk did today, even worse!
In cricket to overturn the on field decision the evidence must be absolutely conclusive. If there’s any sort of doubt whatsoever ur meant to stick with the on field decision
carragher talking about souness dirty  tackles well what about your dirty tackles huh
I'm a United-fan and I hate Liverpool, but that is a clear red. Discusting tackle! Get well soon van Dijk (But not too soon 😋)
Get Graeme off the TV ..........he's an old dithering dumpling
last time i checked Goalkeepers didnt tackle well ive seen far worse,more unlucky than bad i recon .
Can agree not many go out their way to hurt someone, but Pickford's temperament is very clear to see. He's rash. Retrospective red card and 3 game ban IMO, it was utterly shocking.
The offside was the first offence so they had to go by that
Carragher starts talking absolute bollocks here, moron of a pundit
Sack souness awful pundit,he’s a hypocrite after what’s he’s done,calling that an assault behave souness u are an idiot
someone got a few £    no way was that off side
The Grass was too long it made Pickford slip 😂
Jordan made what they used to call a "reducer" 😄
Is carra making out with mic lol
When ever micheal oliver is the referee contrevartial events happen. *Man utd vs chelsea for two silly tackles andre red card *Madrid vs juventus last minute penality
Didn't Carragher clatter a youtuber in a charity game?
Carragher: never wanted to hurt or end a players career  Roy Keane: nonsense
Souness was one of my heroes, but I get a bit frustrated with the hypocricy of ex players like him and Shearer. Souness deliberately broke a players jaw in a European Cup game, and just ask Neil Lennon about Shearer... Duncan Ferguson got 3 months in prison for less than what Shearer got away with.
Hahaha Graeme can go cry about it LOSERpool deserve that luck
Souness is a biased Liverpool player. He made disgusting tackles, sick of hearing his biased voice
Michael oliver best referee???? Umm im sorry but nobody in the prem deserves that title. They're all as bad as eachother.
Grame ahhahahahaha
Very little disagreement in this segment
Graham Nyon Souness
Mcfc fan here ,vvd will be a massive hit for liverpool ,don't think you will win title now
We need roy keane to attest to ending someone's career (håland for city)
Hello, I'm a neutral. Also not from the UK. Liverpool and Everton both aren't my clubs. I respect both though. Love Everton's team this year with James, Allan, Doucoure, Gomes, Calvert-Lewin etc. And also love Klopp's type of football next to Ancelotti being an absolute legend.  So here's my unbiased few on the situation. It was a 100% red card for Pickford. He didn't play the ball, came in with all the risk to injure the player. It should've been an instant red, without any doubt. The result can now be that he put Van Dijk out of action for MONTHS while he gets to keep playing with no suspension whatsoever. That's crazy! Especially due to the severity of the foul. There's no doubt about it that it was too reckless and dangerous. It was the action of the typically panicked goalkeeper. He should've been sent of for sure.
Sounness is a salty prick
Souness literally murdered players in his day
What they are saying is. Pickford is English so sweep it under a rug and pretend it never happend. Souness can see them trying to do that and he’s livid. I would be too. Sky are cowards.
For once, carra shut up, Graeme was absolutely correct
Disgusting, Liverpool's season wrecked in one match
He meant every bit of it not only him but Richarlison also they should be banned
Love it when Souness is pissed! 😂
They need something like an Umpires call in cricket to account for human error
Drunk drivers don't intend to hurt anyone. 99% of them.  But that is unacceptable behaviour.  Pickford's tackle was unacceptable incompetence.
A liverpool legend defends an everton player..... now thats someone who does their job and puts away their past allegiances !!! Regardless of whether he's correct or not, he's still not being biased!
Van Dijk leg got caught in the pitch and Pickford momentum took him out, unfortunate with the injury but that is football... for Souness to call it assault is pathetic, his lead leg never even made contact with him
Dont understand the anger in the studio. From my point of view everyone is agreed
I used to work in a pub at Stockley Park. I would poison their food after that debacle.
When other non relevant clubs lose we get on with it without complaining soon as utd Liverpool or one of the big lot lose or drop points the media make 10 different videos about it
I've lost all respect for Jamie Caragher! I'm a Liverpool fan...
Carra is so wrong here. Retroactive discipline has been issued in the past, also is it was a red card, Pickford should be banned for three games.
Hahah ... Everton fucked their season with a draw ... 🤭🤭🤭
Every ref makes mistakes but if you make them all the time, you are just a bad ref. They are destroying the premier league
HEATED DEBATE
It's only the fact it's a Liverpool player that got  injured, that's there's fuse being made.
Shows u how bad it was when Souness called it an assault
var needs to become a service the ref can ask for, like in rugby...
graeme souness " jordan pickford didnt set out to injure vvd " also graeme souness 2 minutes before " its assault! " get this mug of the tell hes so contradictive and so "ive always got to be right"
Bad challenge yes but if VVD wasn't injured no one would be going on about it.
Mark my words this season will go down as one of the worst defensive years ever and the red amount of red cards and cards that should be red... everybody has been playing terrible defense I.e. terrible career ending tackles to just the sheer amount of tackles that have clearly no thought put into them
Roy Keane was clearly trying to kick a bee off halaand when he did that tackle. Keane is a legend for trying to save halaand from being stung. Btw the bee died
Token black dude spoke for 3mins or so and said absolutely noting
Everyone's talking about VAR now that Liverpool got screwed over but no one talked about it last week when Martial got that nonsense red card against Spurs.
why don't they make the VAR decisions automatized by the computer system?? There would not be any debate on offside cases anymore.
Is Jamie Carragher reporting from a WWII battlefield?
all these ex players want be pundits none of them have minerals to go and be a referee
Shouldn't this video be titled "Darren Moore suggests pragmatic solution to VAR"...
Pickford clearly made a statement on the field with that tackle, next time his opponent will think twice when facing similar situation and would probably back off to save their career.
There is enough x football pros about get them down there and help the people doing var and look at it from the players view
Michael Oliver is the best ref? Yeah, sure
Did anyone tell Pickford that you take the knee before the start of the game? :)
Again guys, by var is bad, it's not the technology, it's the rules and the refs.
This is all obviously Paul Pogbas fault. Obviously.
If pickford gets a suspension either way it doesn't bring vvd back it might actually help everton ffs
Pickford is the England keeper so that’s why the media aren’t looking for blood. Carragher is so biased. Imagine if de gea did it. The media would be looking for a prison sentence
Souness was one dirty bastard he's got no room to talk, at least Carragher tried to be objective. It was a bad challenge but obviously he did not go out to intentionally hurt they guy.
The whole point of var is to assist what the ref and his officials havent seen or if they're unsure NOT to change the ref or officials decision if they're 100% might aswel not have any officials at the grounds anymore and just have police replace them for if it gets heated 😂
Shut up sourness. The blokes so biased its unreal. Where was this unrest when Liverpool got a few decisions for them last season. TAA hand ball against city etc. It was a red card 100% and var is just beyond Inconsistent. But pickford did not go out to intentionally injur someone. Unlike when souness use to play. Souness sounds like one of these mad fans starting petitions to have pickford banned for 6 months and would probably join a Mob to go kill pickford. He's probably going to run and stick a Liverpool flag in goodisons centre circle soon
Souness needs binning from Sky. If Adrian had done that to Richarlison then it wouldn't even have been mentioned
Of course carra defends pickfords mans got a soft spot for Everton absolute shambles of a pundit
I am no united fan but interesting to hear Carragher admitting to nearly breaking Nani's leg.. when it happened I distinctly remember him, Gerrard and a few other liverpool players swearing in Nani's face because he stood up for a few seconds before realising how bad his leg was and falling back down...to me reactions like that from players are worse than the tackle itself.
VAR: Why are you booing me, im right.
They should site players like they do in rugby and Pickford should have a 10 game ban. Not a Liverpool fan by the way
Horrendous assault
It’s sad because even when he returns he’s not going be this van dijk, Pickford has finished him.
99%. The 1% is Roy Keane 😂😂  caragher is spot on here
Jamie: "I almost broke Nani's leg and I felt terrible about it. So, I have a lot of sympathy for Pickford."  Graeme: "I completely disagree with everything Jamie just said about Pogba. I don't think Pogba can have any complaints about his position at United anymore. I mean, who the hell does he think he is earning that much money anyway? Does he really think..."  Jamie: "Hang on a second, Graeme. What are you on about? I didn't even mention Pogba."  Graeme: "Oh, didn't you? Then why the hell are we even talking about Pogba then? Answer me that. He was overpriced when they bought him, he's been a flop everywhere he's gone, he hasn't won anything at United, and his attitude has been utterly rancid since the day he was born. Look, I'm not saying that I hope he dies, but..."  Host: "...but?"  Graeme: "But what?"
Extremely biased referring there. It wasn't just bad, it was biased. There is no way that the ref and the VAR missed Pickford's red card. There is no way that the ref and the VAR saw an offside in Henderson's goal
Souness says different era. So in his era they were allowed to break legs ?
bitter bitter Souness hahahahaha
He’s such a biased pundit towards Liverpool
Klopp has tanked our season by not buying a 4 cb. Joel ' sicknote ' matip will get injured soon. We're properly fucked. The game is rigged. Nothing else can explain these ridiculous decisions. Coote again?
What a crock of shi@e. Souness one  of the most dirty players that ever lived. Pickford mistimed it. He is not a malicious player unlike Sourness.
VAR has been used in the MLS for years and there hasn't been barely any issues and doesn't take near as long to make decisions. Why does the "biggest" league in the world take so long and have sk much problems ??
Souness getting agitated over a bad tackle which it was! He needs to have a look at some of his own, no wonder hes got a dodgy ticker!!
Listen souness going on about bad tackle one of the dirties lIverpool players ever loved leaving his two feet in one sly dirty bastard and known for it  Well said Carr’s m8 only being honest respectful and souness do us all a favour the reds have been lucky in games where you’ve foul players and you more than most was a dirty player.😤👍
Pickford totally  OTT the game is football not MMA ffs and richarlison was no better.
Darren More "When a player leaves the ground with two feet,that's a red card". Pickford is a goalkeeper,and the last time I checked goalkeepers are allowed to jump!!
Real men played football in souneses era not a bunch of pussys who roll around like babies like todays footballers
They’re arguing over different things
Pogba is wrong, not the referees
Carragher using the first microphone ever invented
Oh well never mind eh 😂😂
Fair play to Carra for calling out Souness on his horror tackles. Search on YouTube if you're interested..
Souness is a hypocrite he was a dirty player back in the day, rich coming from him
Souness shocked at a tackle ( it was bad agreed )  this coming from a guy who dished out some horror tackles in his day .
Carragher knows he cant say anything. The tackles he used to do
I did it so it's ok it just happens in football. Well done Carragher, what a blonker.
I haven't read a single word of apology from Pickford. No regret, nothing. Normally after a game you can't get modern players off social media. I accept he didn't do it on purpose. But no apology stinks.
Why does carragher always feel like he has to disagree with Liverpool’s questions and bring up his past he was pointing out that var is braught in to step in and stop these bad tackles not say ow other players have done it in the past so we can’t do anything about it carragher is a bad bellend obviously if var was out when he made his bad tackles then he would of deserved a red the tit and the mane offside was fixed nothing needs answering on that we already know
I'm sorry but I've never agreed with the statement "the player doesn't go in with the intention of hurting the other player" after someone gets seriously injured. Anyone who has played football at ANY level (even just playing 5 a side with your mates) understands that when you jump off the ground towards another player, then there is ALWAYS a risk that you could seriously injure them. That is indisputable, otherwise you would see flying challenges all the time - and why don't you? Because players know that if you leave the ground with your bodyweight then if you connect correctly (or incorrectly) then you're going to break someones leg.   Look at Arsenal's serious injuries - Ryan Shawcross on Aaron Ramsey, Dan Smith on About Diaby and Martin Taylor on Eduardo. All of the players who inflicted the injuries (all broken legs) ended up playing the victim! Are you kidding me? When you go in recklessly you know exactly what you're doing, flying in like that. Unless you're a complete moron with no understanding of space then you know that certain body movements can cause others major injuries. Pickford's challenge was outrageous, and it's not as if I'm a Liverpool fan.
Shut up Jamie. Jus tryna show ur neutral
Souness: I went to Stockley Park 12 months ago. Also Souness: I went to Stockley Park 16-18 months ago.  I'm thinking maybe Souness didn't go to Stockley Park...
Vvd out for the season pickford an accident waiting to happen and the best league in the world still hasnt figured out how to use var all in all a day to forget for liverpool and the  premier league brand
I jst wish Darren Moore would let someone else get a word in
Doesn't matter what Pickford's intentions were or weren't. The video review process has to see the whole picture, not a narrow fragment or single element of any incident. Yes, it was offside, therefore no it's not a penalty, but it was certainly a reckless and dangerous challenge and should have been a red card. However that decision is made, by official in the booth, or the ref reviewing the monitor, it should have been noticed and acted upon.
Pickfords most illustrious career highlight - illegally destroying the worlds best defenders season and even career.  Third rate goalkeeper illegally ends the season for the worlds best defender and does not get an immediate retrospective ban. Third rate strikers tried to break the leg of a world class midfielder and champions league winner and does not get an immediate retrospective ban. Only in England and only the shitty PL management. Everton are a great team but their shitty and dirty play is getting frustrating. This is not WWF. these guys should be getting banned for injuring superior players.  A neutral fan.
I wonder if pickford wasn't english..if Jimmy would still defend him against his own team
And tomorrow you'll have dermot Gallagher defending the refs and pickford! Two footed off the ground, no question its a red
Just shows how much better carragher is as a pundit rather than souness, he has the ability to look at things rationally instead of emotionally, you can tell souness is only going berserk because of his bias towards Liverpool where Jamie can look at it with perspective
how on earth is graeme souness defending his tackles as being from a different generation. Have we regressed in the last 30 years to have weaker knees, weaker bones and weaker ankles. No  You are one of the dirtiest players ever souness, the time you did it has nothing to do with it.
If this happened to Debruyne, they will not discuss about it.
Souness should be nowhere near sky sport, horrible pundit  horrible person go bore some old men with your bullshit
Souness is being pathetic here. What pickford did was clumsy and careless but there was no malice in what he did.
we know you went to Stockley park mate. Pickford should miss 3 games. Get well soon VVD asset to football (United Fan)
Am with Graham how can a referee look at that and say offside. If it was or wasn't offside. He made a career ending challenge. He has to be sent of.
The tackles you did 🤣 Ouch. Not wrong tho.
Cry baby’s only rage when things go wrong for liVARpool
Jamienis talking from a wrong hole,he should go and ask Roy Keane did he meant to break one footballers leg on purpose.
Carragher: I don't think any footballer goes out of there way to hurt a player  Roy Keane: That's there job
SKY LIVERPOOL - Never seen so much commotion over a tackle. As an Evertonian, he should have been sent off, he wasnt....get on with it.
The irony of Graeme Souness accusing another player of ‘assaulting’ another player when he was one of the dirtiest bastards ever to set foot on the pitch. He once broke another players jaw in a European game
"Disgusting tackle by pogba "       -souness
Why fix something that isn't broke???  The offside rule is pathetic. Its embarrassing.  How can an arm be offside..you dontscore with your arm and you dont achieve any advantage by having an arm ahead of anyone else. The offside rule should apply to the torso of the body nothing else. Just like in the 100 metres ( in athletics).
Also, get rid of assistant referees. If decisions are too close to call and they keep their flag down, the balls still in play so normal card offences should still apply. Even Jurgen mentioned this a few weeks back. It can create tension on the players, fans and manager, could introduce risk to potentially injure a player, all while being offside. It doesn't make any sense
Nobody goes out of their way to hurt someone.   Roy keane: hold my Guinness
1:21 "I nearly broke nanny's leg."  "Okay, Jamie. Sounds like that was a bad Christmas, but let's just talk about the game shall we?"
Thought that was John Bishop
Souness knows Liverpool aren’t winning fuckall this season that’s why hahahahahahhaha
Not only has carragher spoke facts, souness has chat macca
What’s Jamie looking at up there
Souness knows Liverpool won't retain the title.. Starting to sulk about it already...
Just look up Souness tackles when he was playing, the guy went flying into tackles a lot Worse than Pickford. The most one sided pundit there is
I feel like Pickford committed a terrible tackle on van dijk and he should be retrospectively banned but when Graeme souness starts talking like that after some of the tackles he made in his time it almost makes me side with pickford
Such honest feedback from someone who was a saint on the pitch like Souness 😂
I like the other pundit but I can't seem to see his name included anywhere in the description?
Player who tried to kill other players 🤣🤣
Let's give him benefit of doubt still he got to be baned on the basis of bad challenge
Pickford didn't mean to injure VVD he's just a donkey. Man has zero composure in his own penalty box
Souness defending his challenges saying 'it was different times' so you deliberately went out onto the pitch to injure another professional? Souness is probably the worst person to ask about this when he was known for being a extremely dirty player! For me Pickford should be banned for 3 games, who cares if the game is over its still a dangerous & reckless challenge, same goes for any red card offence missed in games they should be banned even if the game is over.
Graeme 'Sour'ness back at it again ffs
If he was still playing him and his little legs would have chased the ref everywhere.
I understand Jamie's argument, I  don't think that Pickford wanted what happened, but there's something that really botters me.  Based on the footage I've seen, Pickford close his eyes in the last part. For me, the injury cames because of the negligence of Pickford. He went all in to tackle Virgil and, at the same time, he disengage himself from what could happened next.
I didn't expect this from Carragher but you spoke as a professional player.👏👏  Gram had no ans when asked about him.🤣🤣
Souness:"but where was pogba when all this happened"
souness shud be put in stocks in a park and let him be hit with rotten fruit hasnt got a clue  idiot  clumsy challenge yes  look at the picture in daily mirror makes it look 100 times worse it looks like hes caught him with his boot and from behind the goal u can see knees clash
When even Souness is horrified by a tackle, the world should take note.......
Pickford's a clumsy lump at the moment but he never tried to damage VVD...follow his eyes...it was an accident.
What's worse, having a unanimously clear, legitimate winning goal ruled offside...or conceding a 3-0 lead to the likes of West Ham in the space of 12 mins?       (For me the latter)
Nuke Stockley Park or whatever its called, Sound like something out of a James Bond film. I think Stockley Park is run by crazed super villains intent on ruining the beautiful game + world domination.
great tackle jordan pickford give the man a payrise
Li VAR pool foul all day - Steel 💪 Van Dijk gets fouled - Its Murder 😭😭 No Bias or Corruption in EPL 😂😂
Lmao this reminds me of keegans rant looool scousers at their best
Wasn't Souness arguing for VAR a few weeks ago?
"If Jordan Pickford had done that against Paul Pogba's leg, then Michael Oliver should've sent Pogba off..."  -Graeme Souness
Can we talk about Mane kicking out or Robertson??
Pickford 🤣👻
the 1% being Roy Keane ending Haaland’s career
Var is a disaster they need to sack these guys its beyond a joke how can someone that understands to rules continue to get it wrong so much
No jamie it was all intentional the tackle was made after whistle was blown. Thiago was also targeted at 89th min with nothing to lose it was all intentional too.
Intent doesn't matter, it was wild and dangerous. Son got a red for a much less violent tackle on Gomez, with zero intent to injure him.
The game is getting soft,  injuries are part of the game
Jamie Carragher " 99% of pro footballers wont hurt someone "   unless your Roy Keane
Make your mind up Graeme 🙄
Love how as soon as Liverpool get unlucky there is suddenly a massive nationwide inquest by all of the media into how the hell this went the way it did. A bad VAR decision was made multiple times a week last season. But because an inconvenience has happened to Liverpool it suddenly becomes the biggest deal in world football. Pickford made a bad challenge and got away with it. I'm sure Liverpool have VAR to thank for a lot of their results last season. VAR is a problem but I dont want special treatment for a team thats won the league once. Carra is exactly right. These things happen in football and Pickford prbably should of been off but he wasn't so get over it.
Var is just a tool for corruption.There must be big brown envelopes flying around everywhere.
Michael Oliver IS NOT th best referee..he was very good..but hes made many many big mistakes.. he made more today..var is a joke also.
That’s a straight red all day long. I’m a broken Barcelona fan but I can tell you that’s an assault
Souness did said "it adds to the entertainment. It's an entertainment business."  There's your 'entertainment' crazy old hypocrite
John deluded abraham :"van dijk dived" muppet
That's a great idea from Jamie about experienced refs who are too old or unfit to get around the pitch taking a place at VAR. There have bene some great refs over the years who you would want making these decisions from their seat at VAR. There are some good refs around now, but imagine they had the likes of Webb, Clattenburg, and Durkin helping them from Stockley Park. Top suggestion from Carragher.
The injury to VVD has changed the course of the  title race.  Liverpool can adjust without alisson but VVD is their wall.
Cant stand Liverpool but have to admit. Not ARed more like ARREST !!!! Horrific tackle !!!! Arrest the man!
Some of the tackles Souness made when playing for Rangers were disgraceful . What a hypocrite.
Definitely not an intentional foul. Pickford is a clumsy player and still made a reckless challenge and should have been punished for it
You canny defend Pickford and am no just talking about this game 😂 boys a tool
That was a harsh tackle .. Pickford  should have been sent off .. it shows how incompetent is the  premier league referees with use of VAR .
How on earth is Graeme Sourness still on as a TV presenter?
Souness said it’s a bad tackle, that says it’s all.
I was wondering what terrible tackle carra made to his nanny
Scousers constantly complaining, what's new?
I got to point that English players are less likely to get red and yellow cards than foreign players on similar type of challenges VAR needs to step in and inform the referee and take control to stop these mistakes and even overturn the decision. VAR is to reduce mistakes and give fair treatment to every player. Is what it is here for I believe.
Souness has lost the plot. He performed tackles as bad, if not worse than Pickford's, on a regular basis. It was a mistimed tackle and nothing more.
The video assistant referee is a knacker. Got the decisions wrong on purpose, clearly got something against Liverpool
I will come back when the comments have ripened.
Jamie - that was a terrible tackle   Also Jamie - yeah I nearly broke nani’s leg
souness you patronising prat  well in carra souness such a hypocrite
When VAR decisions were going in favour of Liverpool, they didn't utter a word.
Vandyke now out until after Xmas, could be the whole season!! thanks very much short arms!
Haha coming from the mild mannered souness!!! Dirty bastard back in the day
If Carragher holds that mic any more closer to his mouth it'll be in his gullet
Souness is too much of cry baby.....
Spot on Carra. Im a red. Cannot stand the Blueshite but whats done is done. Banning Pickford wont harm Everton , he's shite. It wont make VVD's ACL heal up. Was a terrible tackle and a red. Robbo and Mane could also quite easily saw second yellows too (Robbos with 2 kick outs should of) We also had a similar VAR decision go for us against Wolves. We should be addressing the faults with VAR and the rules and the officials. No need for this soft arse after the fact shite. If he had meant it, yes. He didnt. Move on and highlight the utter joke that is Stockley park because this will happen and has happened to EVERY team. All the ones laughing now. It will come for them agains soon enough. Address that.
So no retrospective ban?  Wow! So tackles like that are ok then,  no one is saying pickford should be harassed but 100% he should be banned . Them tackles should be discouraged no matter what . They cowardly tackles that can end careers . They didn’t punish it missed it clear retrospective ban 3 game as he would of got for red card
VVD should have been sent off for simulation
Lol not even liverpool fans can agree. Pickford should have seen red.
If that was de gea ooh my God they would have killed him , thank God it was English Pickford
he got the ball....
It doesn’t matter if you set out to injure a player or not, if you make a reckless tackle, it’s a red. You can have absolutely no malice or intent to hurt someone and still be reckless or negligent. That exact scenario is stated in the rules.   As Graeme said, if it goes from the ref on the pitch, to the VAR, then back to the ref at pitch side monitor and you STILL get the wrong call then something is wrong with the people officiating the game!   The technology works perfectly fine, it’s the poor English refs refereeing the game who have been the problem as long as I’ve been watching football.
I just cant take anything souness said seriously...
No offence to pickford but I just think he doesn't know what he's doing half the time, I think it was an accident but pickford just clumsy/awkward
football is football, and bad tackles are inevitable. its a shame it that it does. i play sunday league and as a goalkeeper jumped for the ball, and went over the top and broke my collarbone, there was no hard feelings between me and the player who also went for the ball, football happens
Souness  mind 👍😂😂😂😂
Nothing happens   Souness: I disagree
The Peter Walton dig was my favourite part😂
Everyone saying souness is hypercritical for the challenge... Considering he used to do the same in the past... But football was a mans game back then. Not like today's game played by snowflakes watched by snowflakes.
Pickford the greatest keeper going
Jamie is a hero of mine but fek me , what kind of English biast bulshit is that. Nobody is talking about if pickford meant it or not...because he did not. But the decision was horrendus by the ref/s.
If Pickford was a half descent goalie he would of used his fuc*** hand and not his leg
Carragher: 'I dont think anyone goes out there way to deliberately hurt someone.  Roy keane: Lold my beer
Pickford is way over aggressive and way over rated.
Jamie is talking bollocks. Pickford should have been punished. Why did he feel the need to do that. It was reckless
Souness..ha ha.. shambles is when someone appointed Souness, newcastle manager.. now he is professing!!!!
Pickford should not be playing for England
Fair play to Carragher here
This Taron Edgerton lookalike needs to be punished a ban is fair. I didn’t see VVD using two foot going for that ball. These players think just because it’s a derby they needed to add extra spice for what they do and end up doing those reckless and dangerous.
If its offside then it's out of play if a goal is scored offside it's marked as if the goal didn't happen so what is the difference between a tackle and a goal its great when it goes for you bad when it goes against you
I thought Souness would have been proud of that tackle...pretty much up there with some of his own
Graeme sourness claiming it was assault, when in his career nearly every tackle he made he tried to break legs, shush hypocrit
Souness is silly old fart needs to shut up
Carra laughing in Evertonian 😂😂😂
Complete Nonsense from carra
99% don’t go out there way I agree but Pickford was that 1% that went out his way to do it
Pickford should've beent SENT OFF 😡😠😠
I don't blame Pickford but I do have a problem with the refereeing.
Souness is spot on. Also the ref on the pitch should have to go to monitor at side to have final say. Simple as that.
I normally agree with Souness but I think he was off the mark with this and criticising Lloris
Great clash here, "Behave Graeme!".....love it
VAR: I'm not wrong! The whole world is wrong!
One of the worst ref decisions I've ever seen. It's a straight red.
Nah its not that Jamie is a evertonian from birth, trying to help pickford out a little, but in my opinion there should be some action cah virgil is outtttt
And i dont why there talking about intent,yes most footballers dont injure opponents on purpose, but if you break someone's leg with a challenge on purpose or by accident, its a red.
The foul comes first...   🤬 wtf....   Pickford is goal keeper, his training caused it
Michael is one of the worst refs I have ever seen for years now he is terrible
Excellent tackle by englands brave jordan pickford. My favourite part of the game is when he killed the man mountain
To this day I STILL can't believe Carragher didn't get sent off for that challenge on Nani!
If Pickford's challenge was disciplined and he got the red he deserved, it would've set a precedence during the game. Maybe Richarlison wouldn't have gone into Thiago the way he did. Thiago was extremely lucky to somewhat walk away but it could've easily been a leg breaker. I think that's what Graeme means when saying refs need to protect players, not just from initial incidents but future ones.
Intent is irrelevant here. The argument should centre solely on the legality of the tackle. It’s a red unless someone’s tells me otherwise. Offside supposedly negates that. So when the balls out of play anyone can fly in with a two footed tackle and have it ignored?!
VAR has just exposed how incompetent the Refs are....
Like Souness never assaulted anyone.
Has Jamie got a lazy eye
Disagree with Carra here. Jordan Pickford has a history of doing this. And for a keeper, the only player on the pitch than can use his hands, goes in 1) studs up 2) knee high 3) not looking at the ball 4) with his whole body weight behind him, and it just so happens to be on one of our most important players, you’d be daft to think that it wasn’t intentional.
The lynch mob should be going after vr refs and anyone around those silly decisions. Put massive pressure on them
Souness must have brain damage
Offside is offside
The Ref on the pitch should have the final say, and should have to go look at the monitor if hes unsure. How hard is it to do that? Braindead idiots make these rules up.
What's on the roof, Jamie?
Carra is right. How can the referee protect a player when the challenge has already been made? Does the ref throw himself in front of VVD, to protect him?  It’s not the referee, it’s VAR. The referee has no power.
Can't lie I feel sorry for Van Dijk
So can I shoot opponent or head kick someone who is offside that's interesting  and not get send off
So basically you can kill someone on the pitch with a challenge but if its offside it doesn't matter
Fantastical punditry in my opinion....different opinions but both have good arguments...with a bit of personal stingers for good measure ('When compared to your tackles? BEHAVE!'). The difference between this and the BBC - Shearer, Dublin, Owen, Murphy...all saying 'look at this missed chance, that was a missed chance, look at this bad defending, this was bad defending, look at this good finish, that was a good finish'. Good for you Sky. But please make it cheaper than 14.95, I cannae afford it!!
Terrible tackle  Isn't it dangerous play, regardless of offside?  Red card all day for me, doesn't matter if the game is stopped
It's violent conduct
Ancelloti should just suspend pickford by not picking him for like 3-5 games
Yeeah but when Mane elbowls or punches players without the ball is ok! I get it now :D
Souness: Pogba should have checked VAR to make sure Pickford gets a red.
Virgil is never going to recover from that injury or at the very least not to his best. Not at his age. I don’t think Pickford meant it and you can tell as Carra mentioned, Pickford is in a bad way right now mentally. Pickford at least has to be suspended for a few games or dropped. Dropping goals is one thing but injuring players even if it isn’t deliberate, is another. VAR has to be like the video referees in Rugby Union or at least the Australian A league. I’ve seen it work when it’s done right. They should also switch the microphones on so the fans can hear the conversations like in Rugby or other Football leagues.
They should just give him like a 2 match suspension like if u agree
“Jordan didn’t mean it...Harry is under too much pressure”, funny how they only humanise the English players in the league.
So souness went from it’s not a foul it’s an assault to I don’t think pickford meant to harm him
Graeme is missing the point about whether it’s offside. They should check whether it’s offside. It’s offside so it cannot be a penalty. However, it is a red card for a dangerous foul.  The correct decision is a freekick to Everton for the offside and a red card for Pickford. It’s not difficult.
I don't understand issues being raised about whether the more experienced ref should do the VAR or whether someone else should be in there with the VAR official.  At the end of the day, the highly paid professional premier League ref doing VAR did not even look at the possible red card when 100% of everyone else who saw the challenge said it should be a red card.   There aren't any excuses.
Offside is the foul anything after that isn't
Jamie garragher. Most basis commentator In history of sky sports
I just can’t believe Pickford is the england keeper. Absolute accident waiting to happen every game. Wreckless, small, just whacks it long everytime
PICKford should have been sent off
"as an expert"
Both the offside and the tackle were fouls. The offside came first hence, it will be considered first right.
regardless if it happens or not in football you must be held accountable.
Van dijk is 6’5 and Pickford has caught him recklessly at knee height. It’s something that shouldn’t happen in a football pitch. As a kid you are taught to not go that high in your challenges. Should get banned for 5 games
Souness talking about bad tackles like that. Funny
Absolutely disgusting tackle. Ridiculous how VAR didn’t even act upon it
If a player is through on goal, you can kick them down, stand on them, and break their legs, if you know the player is offside
They need the ref on the pitch to check the monitor and make the decision
I'm a neutral but the tackle was incredibly reckless and a red card.
VAR has made the premier league boring to watch. It isn’t football. It isn’t the best league in the world anymore. The people in Stockley park are not equipped for their job!
At least he has to apologize Pickford what an idiot
pickford is dangerously garbage.
I actually agree with graeme
regardless of what state of mind pickford is in, or if it was intentional or not. he has to be punished, no way can he get away with this.
Souness just hates everton
This is where squad depth matters.... Liverpool have the best first X1 in the country but not best squad in the league.The title race is gonna be interesting
Assault bit rich coming from a man who if you looked at his past tackles he would be getting the death penalty.. Laughable souness as usual
Pickford better delete his social media
Jaime is spot on here. It’s a red but Grahame is gone way over the top especially when he was one to deliberately go out and want to break someone’s leg
What's wrong with Carra
Graeme, just shut up
Straight red and 5 game ban
I Think It Was A Bad Tackle And He Should’ve Received A Booking But I Hope Van Dijk Can Recover Soundly. Should Be A Great Rematch Later On This Season!
Love when Liverpool ex players bicker among themselves.
Best thing Pickford has done since the WC
Carra has a point here.but i still feel bad for virgil..this can define his entire career..he would probably never be back to his previous level again.. tragic..i am not a Liverpool fan..but sad thing to see.
just when our Dutch squad needs him to lead the not all that well performing team....
Hard tackle
Pickford should be banned for at least 4 games. Van Dijk may never return to his previous level
First
