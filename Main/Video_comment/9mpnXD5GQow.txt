0:48 now he scores FOR them
Popped the bubbles 🔥
Corner kickers stop holding your arms in the air it means nothing!
Toon army❤
Well*
And we’ll played Newcastle
Feel sorry for moyes
woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sick game man
Ho Ho Ho Ho...Merry Christmas Everyone...
Funny watching these bubble heads get popped !!!
State of the stands in the last goal 🫠🫠
I support Chelsea, but regardless of that, Newcastle have to be the team that every neutral surely wants to watch at the moment. They are looking dangerous and very very lethal with their play. They deserve to be where they are and this should act as a future springboard to success domestically in future.
Not even a Newcastle fan but I hope they make it into the UCL, that be amazing.
can tell joelinton has those striking instincts with his runs and how he took it round the keeper, didn’t do consistently enough when he played there but in midfield he’s the best of both worlds, incredible of howe to see that in him and have the balls to convert him into one instead of jusr splashing cash on another midfielder which he definitely had the funds to do so
WEST HAM NEED TO RE NEW THEIR  BUBBLES
Fabianski is joking 😂😂😂
Have to say west ham defence just didn't get a grip on the players they should have been marking, it looked easy for Newcastle, west ham are too good to go down 👍
Even tho big Joe is naturally a winger his size definitely suits CM better hence why he has improved so much
The worst defending I've seen so far this season from any team.
Where was Mubama?? Where was Westham full stop!
What do you mean for soft goals⚽️
Bruno’s last name is not pronounced Gimorice FFS.
Wilson is unstoppable😜🤪!
Zouma hit that as hard as his cat!
That was more individual errors from west ham players than Newcastle dominating the game.
Absolute spawn by Newcastle wanderer's
Hope west ham go down
People will start calling Newcastle an “oil club” now. Difference between Newcastle with City and Chelsea is that Newcastle genuinely haven’t really changed much in terms of players. They’ve been smart with their spending and the player they buy. And Eddie Howe pulled off a tactical masterclass here.
Have owners Newcastle united paid the stamp duty for the c,ub
West ham are so dead
Moyes half time team talk must of been a belter
Newcastle premier league Champions 2023/2024 watch this space
I don't think many teams will get an easier win than that
Goal number 4 for Newcastle  Shocking westham keeper  U be lucky to play the next game 😅
I’m sorry but u can’t tell me that westham lost on purpose just so moyse gets the sack 😅
Can you stop video suggestion thumbnails popping up and obscuring the end of almost all highlights Sky put up? Thanks.
Flappyanski back to his Arsenal best 🎉
Sky news U.K. is a pro communist news media.👎
Love how West Ham just give goals away to Newcastle. Wait until they defend and fight like hell against Man Utd
The premier league is on fire this year. Unbelievable
Might be one of the worst performances I've seen from a premier league team
Best Newcastle side since the keegan  years 94 to 96  All that was missing I'm this game was a chip over the keeper by Botman 🌟🌟🌟
Not a Newcastle fan, but wow they are smoking teams😂
2:06, looks like the boys have been practicing their sweaty goals
Everton fan here and just an appreciation post of a team employing a brilliant you g English manager not a old oap Italian,Dutch Spanish dinosaur.Eddie Howe should be manager of the year.fair play
Well the blood money along with an enormous amount of help from the opposition is paying dividends.
Whose dancing now Antonio 👏
David Moyes will be " Feweis"!
Did Wilson really do just do the macarena 😅
I think nufc is the fittest team in the PL, playing unbelievable football at times. This will only get better and better with more investment
Joelinton is a better striker now that he’s a midfielder than he was when he was up front 😂
Isak hands on the hip celebration is equal all day long to Cantonas back in the day. I hope they play it forever because it’s deserved.
goal of the year
Didn’t Shakespeare write “A Comedy of Errors”?
Hammers got bent over
Next season in April it's Bayern Vs Newcastle Could you imagine?!
👍🏻
The difference in the number of empty white seats at 2:30 compared to 2:50 is simply HILARIOUS
John 3:16
Anyone know who the commentator is?
JESUS LOVES YOU
newcastles championship ambitions next season are going to be like newcastle brown ale - theyre going to bottle it! i love me newkie brown me
its amazing wat a change of owner can do for the same players.  throw in a mercenary coach n yer golden
Nice to know that London Hoodoo seems to have gone at long last. Just need to get something from Brentford  & we may just have been unbeaten in the Capital for the whole league season. Never known it to happen in my 42yrs following the Mags....
Those kids behind the goal giving Calum some mouth!  😆😆😆   🤣🤣🤣   😂😂😂
Saint maximin literally should be a superstar. I want him to explode to world class one season, he has all the tools
Who’s Haarland? Take a leaf outta isaks book lad
'FIVE-STAR' Wow really clever Sky Sports.
Fair play to Newcastle from bouncing back after the cup final defeat but wow the 3rd and 4th goals where Christmas and birthday in one And although moyes is under pressure he can't be blamed for individual errors like that
West ham deserved to won that game
Im a man utd fan and I want Newcastle to win the league so that ronaldo will be on ur team and Europe 😮
how moyes hasnt been sacked today is disgraceful
Joelinton cooked Zouma for the last one ngl.
Bye bye West Ham!!
Fabianski had a stinker
Cat Kicker Zouma got a goal
As an Everton supporter, we needed this even though I have no ill feelings towards West Ham as a club.
West Ham have no defence they have nothing they are terrible 😂😂
IF THATS RICHARLISON THEN ITS OFFSIDE 1:15
I feel sorry for Fabianski
VAR is a joke
Thats a lovely Stadium ,Just need to stamp their authority on it
fabiański had an absolute frank sinclair
was that west ham fans booing zouma or were they just shouting his name? 😂
I don't think I've watched any West Ham matches this season. Doesn't look like I have missed anything.
Does moyes not trust areola, there must be something in it because how flapianski is still starting for West Ham I’ll never know
0:56 amazing how he was onside 😂
Wilson’s macarena is class 😂 👏
What Howe has done with this team will never be appreciated enough. Rock solid defence, a hard working midfield and an attack that doesn't stop. Wor Bobby will be looking down with the biggest smile on his face  HWTL ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
What’s happened to West Ham’s defence , give Moyes more time he can get hammers out of trouble
As if beating Fulham is going to change anything for Moyes ? 😅
It was so easy for Newcastle they even stop celebrating goals because they felt sorry for us. Unbelievably terrible performance, only at West Ham.
Seen ones like Joelingtons goal ruled offside how many times this season. Shows the consistancy of VAR.
Howe is proving himself to be a world class coach , Newcastle hit a bit of patch of poor form , and yet here they are up and running again . Say's a lot about attitude in the Newcastle camp they could have just dropped off completely but no .
Footballers have got to STOP goading opposition football fans when they score. Not only do most of them cheat, dive, feign injury and try to get their fellow footballers sent off but they also act like they're ten men by goading thousands of people who have paid to watch them. They have no class, no understanding or appreciation of SPORTSMANSHIP.
Sack your manager tactics.
Fabianski had a stinker. Isak rubbed salt in his wounds big time.🤣
Incredible from the toon west ham gave us help but we were ruthless
I love how cocky WIlson is as an extremely average player with an ego. He will play very very little next season hahahahah
It's looking more and more like West Ham are going down. You see more fight in teams like Bournemouth and Forest. It's bleak to see.
shame wilson will get dropped next season
Alan Smith "he looks a mile off..." Does he?....washed.
so many replays from Sky.
Wilson is doing the dance that he said he'll do on a podcast 🤣
I was at this game, first game seeing westham at London stadium, so I'll take responsibility for this result, sorry my bad
I think they could be Neves, Idrassi and Tierney away from seriously challenging for the league and worrying teams in UCL latter stages.
Gooner here, still kind of want Isak in our team to be honest. I like the profile of the player
Where did all the so called fans go 😅😂
If Newcastle don’t score there then it’s clearly 1-0 West Ham so really good progress for the hammers
Saint Maximin and Joelinton are incredible to watch this season, congrats
Isaaaaaaak 😈
Wilson’s first goal similar to the first at st James park last season thought we where gonna lose 4-2 again 😂😭
Well in hammers great performance keep it up
All the West Ham fans had left at the end embarrassing club
If you sack the manager, you’ve still got them defenders 🤷🏻‍♂️
Arsenal fans will remember this is the Fabianski we know. The fa cup was a 1 off and he was wild in that too
No wonder why hammers are in the relegation
West ham deserved
It can't get any worse for the hammers they was doing so well the other season i think rice will want a move in the summer maybe to the gunners 😊
Not deserved
The stadium was virtually empty for the last goal.
Must be fun being a Newcastle fan now lmao
Newcastle destroyed hammers
Isak’s celebration was cold 🥶
Don't Newcastle just park the bus though 🤔
Moyes has to go right?
Howe is manager of the season.  What he has done with Joelinton deserves a trophy on its own.
So unlucky
Seen better non league keeping and defending than lasts nights 🤬
Everyone talking about Newcastle but what on earth has happened to West Ham this season?! Absolutely shocking.
Sky need to up their quality compared to Serie A YouTube Highlights.
I reckon David Moyes could  blow Bubbles, Skippy, Lassie and all of the board and still get sacked.
Manchester United had five managers in one season west ham have been stuck with the same turd for the whole season hopefully he'll get sacked soon
Zouma must practice football with his cat
Newcastle played well but West Ham's defending was awful.
All the talk is about Moyes getting sacked and he may deserve it but he can’t legislate for some of the mistake Westham made in defence yesterday. Bloody hell they were bad. Almost like they were playing for him to get sacked.
Kurt Zouma ❌ Cat Zouma ✅
What is it about teams ‘playing out from the back’??? Comedy of errors that performance! Moyes on his way probably but FFS players, grow a pair!!!
Blows my mind how West Ham went from fighting for the top 4 to buying arguably better players and ending up in Championship.
Everyone left when Newcastle scored the last goal 💀
Spurs need to be replaced by Newcastle as one of the big 6. ASAP
both these teams haven't a trophy in decades 😂
Joelinton going from the biggest prem flop too a proper part of a potential champions league team.
Imagine the carnage of champions league nights returning to Newcastle. Maybe Mbappe will actually be playing at St James’ next season.
West Ham make any team look good
How the Hell is Moyse still in the job!!! He should be sacked and Rogers get the job 🤷‍♂️
West ham look a sad outfit🙈
Another manager on there way out ???
@WESTHAMFANTV - West Ham got Hammerd at home 5-1 by the Toon !!!
Nathan "the wonder kid" Shelley is clearly not the right manager for the Hammers
Newcastle - champions of Europe next season 🎉🎉🎉
Calamity of errors for West Ham way to save your manager
This commentator is tosh why’s he scream so much
West Ham were awful
West Ham are so crap
Well done Newcastle.  Loving this! (NFFC)
Every small team has a good season now and then. Leicester won the league now they are fighting relegation. Enjoy it while it lasts Newcastle 😂
Holy crap, West Ham playing like they are going down
Next season Newcastle will be right at it...but they need to sign roughly 4/5, players to make this happen no panic buys like Wood, but solid good signings and then they will be a proper force.
Forget David Moyes get Nate Shelley
Comical defending by the Hammers, it wouldn't look out of place in a Sunday League list of howlers
Bruno G passing range is incredible
Newcastle hammer the hammers 😂  Deadest joke of the week
Solid performance
I can see yet another manager looking for job on the merry-go-round of football
Why is the gk coming out on the 4th goal there is 2 defenders there.
How is Joelinton a better striker mow he plays in midfield? 😂
All those empty seats, West Ham fans, you should be ashamed.....of your teams performance 😂
some excellent passing for the goals. great thru balls splitting defence
Wilson with the Macarena, bet Michail is fuming 😂😮
Moyes is gone 😂
West ham may as well have come out wearing shirts saying "we want relegation" pitiful and I don't even put that down on moyes, there is no way those players were told to play like that, they were abysmal
Unseen after match footage:  So Rice, how about that new contract then 🥹
fair play to the geordies. they must be loving life right now. howe has built an excellent team with great attitude.
Justice for Richmond🫡
Everything has just went newcastles way this season
Newcastle to much for poor relegation WHU whom have a game in hand on their bottom rivals  to escape the drop.
Used to be that Newcastle couldn't buy a win in London. Making up for lost time.
I can never ever give kurt zouma respect for what he did he is a animal by nature that has a good career if he didn’t have a good career he would probably abuse cats all the time.however Newcastle played really well
5SM 5WF
The toon looking solid away from home and at home…..top form from the lads again so happy with our club now we have it back and setting the way ahead for the future….flat caps sitting at the table with the top 4/6 is an amazing achievement the commoner tasting the caviar 👌🏻⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
The next contestant to leave premier leauge manager love island is....... DAVID.
West Ham need a new manager
Awful defending by West Ham.
Literally went from a middle table club to one of the best clubs in England.
Stop stop he’s already dead
Take a bow Newcastle 🙏 well played lads United fan
Fanianski is so bad, why do west ham play him when they have Areola
Definitely entertaining 😂😂
The stadium looked empty. Like they only allowed a certain amount of fans
Longstaff was later seen outside the ground buying a tray of curry to eat with the Rice he had in his pocket all game.
I'm a Chelsea guy through and through and seriously believe the toon deserve what should be our spot in next years CL. Good on them.
Westham should be embarrassed that a player as terrible as joelinton got three past them. The guy can barely stand up straight
West Ham battered again 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Magnificent
Looked like a fixed game it was that bad 😂
Is this thumping natural? Newcastle, I am asking you. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:12
Newcastle have improved alot. In summer they will probably spend big too.
Arsenal fan here, can we all just appreciate how Joelinton has transformed into one of the most consistent midfielders in the league? Eddie Howe has finna done a remarkable job with him, 2 goals last night, outstanding!
Moyes out! Potter in
feel better watching this after episode 4 of ted lasso
That was hilarious to watch ....  The Hammered ! 😂
Newcastle are seriously gonna be premier league contenders next season when they strengthen their sqaud even more
Moyes next for the sack.
Take nothing away from Newcastle, they were absolutely awesome, but any team with "Kitty Kurt Zouma" in their lineup surely deserves to be relegated 🐈 😻 😂
Eddie Howe so good he might not even need any Saudi money:)
Champions league football here we come!
Gotta say joelinton is world class as a centre mid
Lol
🫣 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Wet Spam never fail to be in a relegation battle 😂😂😂😂
every season there is that 1 club who i being dominant Newcastle is that team this season who will it be next season
Absolute brilliant toon toon Black and white army
You can tell how hard of a job the refs on the pitch have with that offside.... Looked miles off but he was a fair distance onside
West Ham suicidal defending . Number 4 wouldn’t play for me again . Making Joelinton look like a worldy .
West ham have one of the worst fan bases in the league, 4-1 down and the stadium is 4/5 empty..
Another one bites the dust
Bruno's playmaking is up there with De Bruyne, his vision and passes are lethal
Celtic fan here.just love seeing newcastle do well .big shout out to the travelling toon army who make the long journeys and get rewarded .great people.
hot take but if newcastle got kane they would win the league
Allways thought hammers had too much to go down but defending  of that quality  is worrying  if your a hammer.
I know how passionate fans are and I can feel sorry for the hammers fans. But as an Everton fan myself the only thing keeping us up this season are the teams around us losing.
This Newcastle team are on 🔥
west ham played with heart . but the defence was terrible . come on the toon .
fabianski ?. more like arthur askey
Please stop putting all the pop up links on when there is still highlights playing. Pretty much missed the last goal
can see moyes getting the sack however glad the toon are doing great.
Dear west ham we are going f down man
I wonder how Newcastle dors under Eddie Howe in the UCL, as a football fan that is going to be really interesting to watch
Has rice done anything this season? Hugely over-rated.
It’s happened again 😂
Absolute state of football fans, never seen so many chavs (aka subordinate Lower life form)
Feel for Moyes ev1 of his players hi let. Him down so bad disgraceful
West ham are being moyseed
Great to see Newcastle going well hope they get top4 at worst .......west ham defence woeful
Have you ever seen worse defending?
Love the toon me
West Ham gave them 4 easy goals Newcastle was lucky
Who has paid fabianski for fixing this game!
Goalkeeper 🪦⚰️
0:42 Wilson’s ⚽️ celebration was a pre-arranged dance (with Antonio from West Ham) should either of them score today. They’re big mates and have a BBC podcast together. 🎵Hey Macarena, aye! 🕺🏾🖤🤍
A comedy of errors!
We thoroughly deserve to get relegated after this performance ..   pls get rid of moyes now .. he not only has lost the dressing room but everything else as Well.   Thank you for what you've done but time to go ...
west hams ground is far too big for them  ,no wonder their team isnt very good ,still all that money they saved not buying decent players and moving into an 60s esque  athletics stadium has payed off , theyll be back to being a "massive club" next season where they belong in the championship
Fabianskis had a nightmare there.
Just to let you know a replay of West Ham's defending will be shown tomorrow evening on UK Gold. 🤣
Outstanding quick thinking by Isak for the fourth.  Well done to Callum Wilson to keep scoring and in turn keep his place in the starting lineup.
Isak man what a footballer absolutely buckled
Alan st max brilliant 👍👏
I think what is happening is something extraordinary . It's like every player knows the club has the dosh to replace them and they've said.... I'm going to make myself irreplaceable .
Getting Thiery Henry vibes from Isak with the hands on the hip’s waiting for the ball to go in🤣
Joelinton is a weapon this season
Man Utd should pay attention
Beautiful performance by Newcastle. The confidence and talent in this team is insane. ASM with his trickery, Wilson with accuracy, Isak with his composure, Bruno with his brains and a wall as a defence... Eddie Howe, I salute you my friend.
West ham IN HUGE TROUBLE!!
whats the point in having linos when we have VAR now?
As a neutral would love to see Geordies make top four. Sick and tired of same old teams being in there. As a Derby fan love to also see good old Forest and Leeds replace Hammers in the bottom three!
Class night at the stadium, we all admitted West Ham helped out quite a bit.
That last goal was absolutely shocking defending
Where credit is due there's credit deserved honestly Newcastle are something that nobody would of expected well even 2 years ago. But since Eddie Howe came in. They've only lost to Liverpool twice Man City twice last season. This season lost to Liverpool twice in both games they didn't deserve to lose and also Man City. Shows how much progression Newcastle have played on Sunday they were far better and won 2-0 against West Ham it was sloppy and gift wrap at times but they do take their chances and it looks like they will seal top 4 and champions league football for next season.
Let’s be honest NUFC player recruitment since the takeover with Pope, Burn, Botman, Bruno and Isak is nothing short of phenomenal.   Not to mention the huge improvements to Willock, Schar, Longstaff, Almiron, Joelinton and Murphy.   If we get top 4 Diaby  and Maddison incoming… 👀
Would love to see them get champions League
I like that ASM is starting show end product to his skill, getting assists
Joelinton doing a leicester 🤣🤣
Wilson hitting the macarena.. the fans fuming.. isaks hands on his hips.. what a match.
Fun Fact:   Kurt Zouma only scored because the ball was painted with a picture of a cats face
Sacked in the morning
Thank you to PIF saudi for believing in the great club, while others did not want to take the risk, hope PIF spend more and invest in the club to make it a competitive club in Europe 🙏🏼👌🏼.
Moyes the next manager to get the chop after this performance
Gimma-rice 😂😂😂
Love seeing west ham battered
fabianski 💀
That's it folks for the top 4 arsenal, man c, Newcastle and United conference league for spurs. Well done Newcastle you deserved it long while since shera. 👏.
0:42 Wilson's celebration with the raging West Ham fans behind 🤣
I'm sure Wilson will receive some racism on social media after that celebration 0:41
THE SEATS HAHAHAHAA
Im a Fulham fan , I so surprised West Ham do not have Areola as their no.1 goalkeeper . When Areola was at Fulham, he was a solid keeper and better than Fabianski imo
How is moyes still manager after spending all that money
Jesus christ, that's some of the worst defensive play iv seen this season. Good bye westham good bye 👋🤭
Magpies crapped all over the Hammers. Isak and the hands on hips was the icing on the cake 🤣
MILLWALLLLLLLL
Newcastle are looking even more scarier, Saint Maximin becoming more consistent, Bruno turning world class, Joelinton becoming one of the most consistent cms in the league, one of the leagues best keepers in Nick Pope and a very good consistent defense
I prefer not to talk about that game 😭
Brilliant From Wilson Again
That podcast with Wilson and Antonio gonna be so much funnier now👀😂
Joelintons reinvention is incredible, that man is definately taking lessons from Choupo-Moting
I remember when Joelinton fluffed his lines. Kicked the grass before the ball and hit tammed shots at goal. The way he took those goals was that of a striker. The transformation over the past 15 months has been amazing.
fabianski getting shipped back to poland after this performance surely
THE BOOS FOR THE CAT BEATER. LOVE IT
rice needs to find a better team
Wow the hell has happened to West Ham? Liverpool have a have fell off a cliff but they have fell off the earth
Flappyhandski on it again, well done the Toons!!
Fabianski LOL
Moyesy must be thinking " just get me the ...k outta here"
Well done Newcastle x
Headline should have been “nailed” Hammers
West Ham's defence is so comical 🤣
Honestly, I want to see Newcastle in the Ucl spots. Spurs don't deserve to be in it. Forget their poor form this season. They have always failed to impress champions league wise every year.
Eddie Howe deserves the best pay rise!
The stands😂
I think Eddie Howe good Manager and players great along with coaching skille very good recruitment I'm man utd fan . Newcastle don't give  up best defensively in premier league they play as team .
What happened to almiron?
As a massive Liverpool fan you have to admire the football Newcastle are playing and they fully deserve to have a go in the champions league 😊
Everyone talking about Everton going down! You wana watch West Ham 🤣🤣🤣
Funny when the people say it's because of the oil money yet chelsea have spent 600m and gone backwards and are in 11th place. Also act like they wouldn't love it if their club got the oil money and could afford anyone lmao
This was absolutely brilliant, look how many left after Isak scored 😂😂
Well that’s moyes getting sacked in the morning if not I feel for West Ham fans 😂😂😂 not
Eddie Howe is doing this with Almiron Jacob Murphy and Joelinton. What a coach
I think the world cup ruined the season with teams having to play a game literally every 3 days. The relegation battle is so tight that anybody from 12th down could go depending on how the next 9 games play out. To possibly lose Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Leicester is hard to fathom.
wow west ham sleeping  i thought they wanted to stay up
No mentions the empty stands at the end??? Hilarious
How is David Moyes still in a job? I'm just curious i'm not a West Ham fan.
The Geordies hammered the Hammers
That was utterly bonkers. Given how tight the points are on the fringes of the top four, goal difference could play a big part, and here's West Ham pretty much going "Okay, have a few more goals."
West Ham are actually going down…..Jesus Christ
Newcastle's second goal (Joelinton) shows why assistant refs are now told to keep the flag down. Looked offside at full speed, clearly onside when reviewed.
Can’t blame the manager for player’s mistakes
newcastle united = class  we are champions league  it's happening...
1:55 to 2:08 is the funniest bit of commentary I've heard so far, this year.
aghred has no level to play for West Ham 😂amateurs
Shambolic performance from our side, so many mistakes 😂. I can’t see a good end to the season with the upcoming fixtures! Maybe a win against Bournemouth..
You could say.... West Ham got Hammered
Glad the cat beaters lost big
West Ham tonight were their own worst enemy. But i'll gladly take the 3 points off the eastender's.....
When he’s not kicking Cats, he’s scoring Goals 😂
David Moyes has the look of, Don't blame me, blame the players, please don't sack me🤣🤣🤣 let's blow some bubbles
Let's be honest, all the comments on here will be from people praising Newcastle, and they have been fantastic this season, but west ham were woeful. That level of defending is atrocious. And the individual errors gifted most of their goals away. As a Leeds fan I know all about this. But this type of result is so damaging to a team in their position because it just kills any confidence they have left. I don't blame Moyes, the players need to take some responsibility
Would love to see Newcastle in the champions league
Fabianski oh dear
By far the worst defending of seen in the premier league
Amazing
Took you lot how many years to actually start playing good lol
Lol thanks Newcastle, Leeds fan MOT
I think the top 4 will be how it is right now at the end of the season
Saint max assist on 1st goal was disgusting ⚫️⚪️
One of the worst goalkeeper performances of recent history
If Newcastle appointed Lampard 😂.
West Ham imploded.  They were in the game at 1-2 down but then mistakes.
5 Great goals, but Isak slamming on the breaks for the 4th 🤩🤩🤩.... UNREAL
Newcastle deserve 3rd spot hands down.
Taxi for the goalkeeper
Is the West Ham Goalkeeper on herbs. And they call him a Goalie. What an excuse for a Traindrivers Engine. I highly suggest he goes back to the Paddling Pool of Goalkeeping where he truly belongs ! ! !
West Ham’s only hope is winning the league in Ted Lasso 😂😂
Moyes will be gutted to find out that one of his teams best efforts at goal that hit the post wasn’t even from his own player
Newcastle are mental
West Ham defensively I think worst team in league they make sooo many mistakes consistently
Eddie Howe do you do it? Top manager
Taxi for Moyes 😮
another long night ahead reading this game , that allows you say, what sort of football we are playing out of this world, may it keep up
The goals West Ham conceded are a disgrace
As a toon fan,I honestly wish the best for the west ham fans,you deserve more, completely mismanaged at the minute,good luck for the rest of the season!
I feel sorry for west Ham fans and my brothers sisters mum and stepdad support the hammers but we’ll credit to Newcastle as they have been a good team this season Callum Wilson doing the Macarena top notch and hilarious 😂 😂
Howe is a fabulous manager.  West Ham though. Woeful.
Flappyanski
I’m going to shock you now would you believe me if I told you that Liverpool beat Newcastle United home and away this season
Wilson scoring and doing the Macarena is hilarious 😂
Why they boo Zouma
Moyes is done
Guimareis is just pinging balls all over the place - I love it. So accurate and dangerous.
Glad that wasn't Man United 😬 We couldn't handle another battering like that 😂
And award for worst defensive display of the season goes to....😂😂
To be fair i questioned eddie howes decesion to start wilson over isak but he proves us wrong time and time again and even when he brought isak on he scores definitly proving hes the best manager in premiere league in my opinion cause imagine what he would do with starting line up like man city or liverpool etc the future is bright for us definitly cany wait each transfer window we will get better and better 🏟⚽️🥅
What is David moyes even still doing there!?
Lovely gifts from that CB & Fabianski.  Newcastle will need to sign Santi Muñez⚽🤪
Fabianski is done in the premier league now, he’s passed his sell by date.
West Ham 😂😂😂😂😂
That has to be 5 of the worst goals I've ever seen conceded at Premier League level.
Toon for life ❤
Don't worry West Ham fans - hapless Wolves will help to keep you up.
Isaac goal is full of football IQ 👏👏
The change in fortunes for both clubs in just over a year is crazy  Newcastle surely getting Champions League now, West Ham can look forward to games against Millwall next season
Put in top shift there lads well done nufc x
Terrible performance and match from the hammers. We Gave  goals on a plate to them. Given up!!! Get fabinski off the next match for his terrible mistakes. He needs to improve or face consequences. Need aeorla in goal for the next few matches. At least he tries to save them. Westham needs to improve or moyes needs to go. We Hammer fans have been saying this for weeks now. It's his time to go. He did great last season with us. COYI. COYI.
Bruno is the key to this Newcastle team . West Ham need to get rid of Fabianski if they want to compete for European spots , gave away the ball so many times instead of a simple 5 -10 yard pass .
there's only one United!
Joelinton went from one of the worst most useless strikers I have ever seen to genuinely a top 5 prem CM. Fair play
Telling you Isak is gonna be a BIG problem.....
After seeing West Ham smash AFC Richmond earlier today, I needed this.
nah they’ve actually conceded 2 to Joelinton
west ham are a joke lol
Nothing but respect for what Eddie Howe has done
Playing for champion leauge what they said  Now fighting in the bottom half lol West ham going down
Eddie Howe is such a good manager 👏
I just can't stop replaying Isak's goal, unbelievable
If we can clinch CL football next season we’re gonna attract some beltas in the summer.
One more Manager will be sacked now
Another masterclass from Bruno G. If we get Champions League he has to get into the team of the season.
West spam o dear
Isak's goal is a thing of beauty. Calm, composed and confident.
West Ham gifting 2 goals sad times moyes needs to be sacked for them
1:54"That's trusting your Goalkeeper" even when the keeper shouldn't trust you :)j
The Hammer 🔨 is broken 😅
1-3 and 1-4 are goals to ban those players for a long while. Kindergarten mistakes, Jezzz
1:54"That's trusting your Goalkeeper" even when the keeper shouldn't trust you :)j
I’d love West Ham to go down
Isak hands on hips with the cool finish is epic😂🤣⚫⚪
You can tell Newcastle players, are playing for the right to still  be in the squad when they start spending the millions next season.
Sacked in the morning,  you're getting sacked in the morning, sacked in the morning.
Loving the macarana by callum Wilson
I was there 🎉
Honestly thought we would struggle tonight for some reason... How wrong was i😂 what a performance ...
I was about 12 the last time Newcastle were so high in the table
As a Liverpool fan, I hope Newcastle make it to the Top 4, they deserve it. Much more deserving than we do, we've been rubbish this season.
Rice's shooting is worse than mine. good God
The sporting integrity of the premier league is officially dead.
What a game, what a team, what a gaffa what a season
Rice is still world class though 🤨
As a neutral it was amazing to watch a team that can finish after watching chelsea and liverpool be excruciatingly incompetant infront of goal
Champions league for Newcastle looking very likely
Anyone else notice how that coufal purposely stamps on joelintons head? Need to be brought up
Newcastle weren't even that good, West Ham shot themselves in the foot... Multiple times
So if relegation is such a ‘disaster’ how come Newcastle is riding so high now, having dropped as recently as 2016?
The amount of empty seats, embarrassing. I guess some have to be at work tomorrow 😂
Who parks the bus??? 👊
1:33 no cats were harmed in the making of this goal.
Newcastle and arsenal had done the best transfer window and got everything right
How bad were West Ham. Jesus talk about gift 3 goals to Newcastle
Explain !!You are in a dog fight 2 down get one back, then come out and give the STUPIDEST goal away , why? why ? just get it out of the danger area. Taxi for Moyes
I can see David Moyes getting sacked now
Lampard is gonna finish his stint at Chelsea then get a job at West Ham next season, won't he? 😂
Strange but great result, I think the scoreline flatters us but West Ham's defence was CATastrophically bad 😉 but we took our chances very well tbf
👋👋
Man went from Joelinton to Joe Linton and back to Joelinton, Brucie should be locked up for almost ending this guy's career
So proud again of whoar Eddie and the lads brilliant hunger for goals solid in midfield and passing was excellent
ya getting sacked in the morning!
The empty seats at the final goal lol
Zouma hit that ball harder than his cat
I can only assume that West Ham hates Spurs so much that they let Newcastle have 5 goals to keep Tottenham out of the top 4
The Hammers getting hammered as usual 😃
Bruno G. What a player!
Isak needs to celebrate every goal like that
2:28 😂😂😂 yh, if I was a West Ham fan, I would've left the stadium. "Safe innit"
Is there a fire drill? 2:52
Newcastle are getting champions league football and finishing above Spurs and United, I’m calling it (from a United fan, but we’ll still get 4th I reckon)
Westham defenders awful. They didn’t even challenge the first goal and it was downhill from there. Shocking defending😊 should fine the players that was awful. Deserve to go down.
put the soda in the wockhardt
Hammers Getting Hammered!
Isak's celebration is cold 😂
Newcastle having a great season as an Arsenal fan looking forward for Newcastle Vs Arsenal game
It will be crazy to see West Ham go down with some of the players they have, not the only team this year to be outplayed by Newcastle
Should be investigated for match fixing, some of them goals are comical 😂😂😂
Couldn't have happened to a nicer club! West Ham that is, I really hope they go down, preferably with Everton! Up The Mighty Villa! 🤣
Isak is an underrated baller💫
You'd have to be silly to fault Newcastle. WHU deserved what they got. Scoreline says it all.
As a West Ham fan I will say one thing relegation
I won’t mind if West Ham go down the toon will need a bigger squad when we’re in the CL next season Rice and possibly Paqueta will add to our squad.
2-0 How easily defenders rely on hope of offside.
The hammers were hammered …
Wow Newcastle are pure class, as a spurs fan we literally have zero hope of top 4 but newcastle actually deserve it.
How can moyes be sacked watching that, his players let him down massively, moyes can’t control those mistakes
WILSON FULFILLED HIS MACARANA PROMISE IN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANTONIO 😂
If Eddie doesn't get MOTY it'll be a travesty.
Fair play to all the west ham fans who stayed, saw alot leaving.
The cup final should be good 👍
Newcastle have been unbelievable this season. Honestly, fair play to them.
Chelsea’s hopes of finishing top 4 were over a long time ago but I’d love to see Newcastle finish in top 4 this season. I hope Newcastle batters arsenal in their home game just to see them bottle the title race at the last second.
The most football manager game I've ever seen
Isak goal of the season
West Ham were an embarrasment
Fair play to Aguerd for not immediately bursting into flames after that mistake. Don't think many would have shown that level of restraint.
Keep watching isaks goal
Declan Rice is too good for West Ham
The way he just stood there, hands on hips. Total class.
stadium empty at the end😂
West ham gifts of goals
Look how quickly the stadium emptied, west ham wont last long in the PL when their own supporters already waving the white flag
Newcastle went through a mini dip but have been resurgent since the Carabao Cup loss. Well done to Newcastle. They deserve a place in the Champions league
Brilliant win we took our chances. West ham were really poor. Moyes surely gone in morning. Up the league  we go....
To be fair to Moyes, he did the setup well. Got the substitutions okay.  Can't blame Moyes Iam afraid. The players were crap. Looked as though   they were on drugs, completely out of the game, no fight, physically weak, clueless, can't be bothered  What a disgrace. I wonder what they do in training if they are this poor. Iam not interested in the club  anymore.  we will lose against Bournemouth. No joke.
Fabianski ahahahahahahahahahahah
Flappyhandski will cost Moyes his job. Also, Joelinton went from a joke striker to an underrated midfielder. Deserves credit for hard work
Scary the animal abuser still plays
Newcastle are amazing to watch now Eddie howe has brought life back into such a magnificent football club each player wears the newcastle shirt with pride.
1:56 Perfect Commentary
Callum Wilson is such a tidy player, never fails to impress me with his finishing
Give us the Amazon Newcastle documentary already. Wanna see what gear they’ve been taken this season behind the scenes 🚀  Bruno been importing in some of the South American finest 😮‍💨
This will be Newcastles best ever season
What is wrong with these goalkeepers ???
Rice the first £300 million player🎉
Absolute diabolical performance by West Ham 😂, how on earth does Moyes have a job
All credit to Newcastle but West Ham's defending was shocking. all 5 of those goals where comical. amateur stuff
West ham getting ready for life in the championship 😮😂
player mistakes. will they be held accountable
Toon surely has top 4 nailed down along with man utd, maybe Brighton have a chance of top 4 with 2 games in hand. Thay leaves spurs in a horrible position and Harry boy will leave and spurs will be a bottom half team again with a billion pound studuim could be worse could be Everton in the championship with a spursy studuim 😅😅😅😅
Newcastle will be the new Oil club…fans weren’t interested until the take over just like Man City. Shame of football.
Best United in the country. HWTL
Glad to see fans are still booing that dirty cat abuser.😘👍 Moyes has got to go.
UTM!
my team HWTL 🖤🤍
If moyes doesn’t get the sack, that would be unfair to everyone else👀
Was West Ham on AIRPLANE MODE ffs. 👀✈️
Thank you Newcastle! That result helps us(Leeds) massively, especially with others losing yesterday and us getting a big win
Well that is Newcastle season now
Well done Newcastle great result for you!
Dang. The hammers got…. Well hammered.  I know. Very original.
What r West Ham doing that’s a tragic performance by the Hammers but congrats to Newcastle
Even with Saudi money newcastle still won't win a trophy 😂 what it been 40 years ? 😂😂😂😂😂
Too many gifted errors from West Ham.
I respect all of the teams, but as a Newcastle fan, allow us this great feeling we have right now.   Its been a long time.
West ham get battered everywhere they goooo 😂
Moyes will be sacked now.
Newcastle were exceptional, their transformation under Howe has been incredible, all credit to them but West Ham's defending was absolutely shocking
Maxi leaving with both pockets full of ankles yet again. HWTL
Joelinton for the Ballon D'or!
I'm happy for Newcastle fans to experience happier days after all dross they've had to endure over the years under Mike Ashley.
Brilliant to see Newcastle up there, good times for them, from a Villa fan.
Newcastle easy playing ucl next year 🤯
We played pretty well but West Ham had a collective brain fart - almost all of our goals were either poorly defended to just 100% avoidable. They should stay up but they’ll need to play a hell of a lot better than this.  We’ll happily take Bowen and Rice off their hands if they don’t though.
How to empty a stadium 🏟
The Fabianski sabotage is HILARIOUS😂😂
Isak🔥
It's reallt hard to call this 5 star Newcastle with the quality of the goals...
Eddie Howe still has most of the squad from last season and he's got Newcastle looking like a team that looks certain to finish in the Champions League. What a job he's doing 👏.
Thought West Ham could potentially take points off Newcastle, and they ended up shipping four comical goals.  Newcastle definitely deserve to play in Europe next season.
Moyes to join the list of sacked managers this season
Petition for Isak to celebrate like that everytime he scores.
newcastle fans are gassed because they beat west ham 🙄
What happened to people saying Newcastle don’t score enough? They have a much better goal difference than Man united and Spurs…
I don’t think I’ve seen us play an easier game since the championship
That game was tougher than the scoreline suggests, West Ham have some very good players they just look well short of confidence NUFC fan
Rice really needs to leave West Ham ASAP.
Newcastle has a very good team, this year. However, Newcastle did Not destroy or even really beat West Ham - West Ham by undisciplined, careless, unfocused, amateurish total screwups; destroyed and beat themselves in this game.
Isaks celebration should go down in history with cantonas imo. Actually should do it every time he scores.
Zouma thought the ball was a cat💀💀
Times for Moyes to get in the sack with the rest of them.
Who would've thought Joelinton would transform from being a hopeless Striker into one of the best Attacking Midfielders in the league 😆.
Easter has come early for Newcastle gifted their goals which they dispatched they have bounced back after a dip in results the Hammers need to get their act together and quick as their form is like a Yoo Yoo .
Come on!! URRACAS!!!
want both united clubs to get top 4 think it will happen # GLAZERS OUT
Beginning of the second half, empty seats...well hot-dogs were more important.
Arsenal still have to play these at St. James 😬 praying for a bout of food poisoning in their dressing room to coincide with our visit
How many mistakes 🤣🤣
Rice belongs in the championship with west ham, English media linking him to  arsenal, but arsenal don't want or need him
Hammers got hammered ⚫️⚪️
What a week, hammered Manu and Hammered the Hammers💯
newcastle have just made the biggest turnaround ever. this is insane
Moyes sacked tomorrow
Absolutely poor from Newcastle that is now the 20th goal they have conceded this season, pathetic 😂
“That’s trusting your goalkeeper”. 🫢
TOON TOON
Rice is the most average midfielder ever, so overrated
Zoma looked like he was kicking his cat!
Newcastle Back to the Keegan years
Newcastle are great as long as they aren’t defending corners. At least 50 percent of Newcastles conceded goals have been from corners
Ruthless from the lads tonight. Bit nervous at the end of the first half but luckily got the goal early in the second. West Ham will stay up this season. Apart from the daft goals conceded a wouldn’t say they played particularly poorly and showed they will have enough to pull away from it ⚫️⚪️
Flappyhandski back to his roots
Home fans left after West Ham scored??
West Ham's fixture list looks tough
Newcastle too embarrassed to celebrate in the end
Thank you Newcastle lovely football I have to say❤
has to be an nufc totw next week no doubt, hopefully joelinton since he hasnt had a special card yet
By the time last goal comes stadium is empty🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
west ham got the worst fans
5 at HOME is unacceptable
West Ham going from cheering to boo'ing because its Zouma is too funny
How can areola not get a game over fabianski ? A don’t watch West Ham week in week out but a have seen some games in Europe and areola looks better thn fabianski.
You have to give West Ham such credit for giving away 4 goals with such a variety of different mistakes…ranging from bad marking , poor offside trap , dallying on the ball and a classic goal keeper clanger. It takes some doing in one match and shows a real strength in depth in their overall defensive  incompetence.
Moyes in the queue with his P45 in the morning
Watching the stands progressively get emptier as the goals keep coming is hilarious. 😂
Never seen so many ridiculous goals in one game. Hammers keeper definitely a Newcastle fan 💀
Bro those 4 goals after Wilson's was so poor
Forget about this Blx about assnal this and that. Yeah they might win pl, but this black and white monster is starting to wake up, and once it arms itself…. Brooooooooooo, watch out for years.
Isak is the real deal 🔥
So many empty seats.
Thanks Wilson had a tenner on him to score 2 goals, £170 up 👍🏻
i could be so wrong but i wonder if some of these mistakes and lack of energy are down to fasting ?
West-ham will have the best stadium in the championship
If Newcastle hold on to a CL place Howe has to get manager of the season. The turn around is absolutely incredible with very little money spent aswell. Props to Eddie Howe, incredible manager, could be looking at the next Brian Clough.
Joel linton against 4 west ham defenders at the end was a joke lol
Newcastle in europe next season is going to be wild, their fanbase is easily the best and biggest in the country.
bruno guimaraes influence and passion is incredible and jolintion is playing so well newcastle as a team are just brilliant as spurs fan it's painful watching my own team but newcastle so enjoyable to watch
The defender is more at fault for the goals as he spent too much time away with the fairies.
One word: Wow 🤩
Enough space to swing a cat in that box for Zouma’s goal…
these magpies are flying all the way to the ucl in eddie they've got a brilliant coach the owners have the cash
Bye bye mickey moyesw
Fans who arrive after second half kick off 😂😂 haven’t sat and a goal being scored 2:00
You’re getting sacked in the morning
West Ham Steve Bruce is looking for work ha!
Spurs are better than both teams 🤷
Youve gotta feel for Moyes. Literally what can he do about most of those goals, you cant account for it
West Ham giving out more gifts than Santa.
Amazing fro Newcastle, but absolute stunned how many empty seats are there when West Ham are 4-1 down..
What can ANY manager do when 'Professionals' play like that....
i better see Areola start next game Fabianskis fell off
I think the playerd are to blame for that performance from the hammers not David Moyes
Another unbelievable result for the TOON we are in dream land right now great form at the most important team of the season ... can't believe with this many games left Champions league is fully in our hands and Spurs still have to come to St James .. Eddie's got the lads playing a great style of football we are not just limping our way into top 4 we are completely dominating teams .. TOON TOON
West Ham with a bloopers video today
And he still has a job
Kurt Zomua can kick cats it's a shame he cant kick players otherwise west ham would be unbeatable
I can see Moyes getting the sack after this...
Love way Isak stands there and puts his hands on his hips waiting for the ball to dip in 😆
Even worse then when we lost to Brighton just gifted Newcastle the win
The disrespect on joelinton to suggest ads as he scores at the end is a joke man’s went from a laughing stock to a stong and athletic beast for Newcastle
I get why they are booing zouma but he's the guy that scored lmao. Should be glad its not 5nil😂
West hammered
POV u went straight to the comments to try get the most likes
I’m really worried about the irons, don’t support them I just don’t really want to see them get relegated
Can't wait to see the toon in the champions league
West Ham are the best team in West London 😂😂
Hwtl 🤟⚫⚪👊👊👊👊 would love to see us in the champions league again 🙏
Saint maxi has been on point for the toon!
No way Championsip team + £200 million is worth a 3rd spot on the Premier league.
appreciation comment for those who sat through the united game and missed this beauty
Why does your thumbnail include the score line? Annoying af. NFL don’t do it..
West hams defence need sending to jail for that comical performance
West Ham still 500/1 against going down?
Great performance from Newcastle! West Ham fan here. I thought we actually played okay at times, but the errors are shocking. Absolutely diabolical. And do NOT get me started on the ineptitude of this manager. Look at Howe in comparison. Levels above. I hope the Toon get top four, because as a neutral, that's a great club with brilliant fans.
Happy for the geordie people nice folk
Absolutely awful from West Ham
Maxi played a blinder
Can't be anything other than proud of the spirit these lads have, great result , dream land
Fabianski deary me
Honestly why do i support this club we play like we have blind folds on .  And fab is awful literally a pensioner.  And how is Moyes still here
What a defensive disasterclass from West Ham lol.
Have a 5alive hammers you looking thirsty
Newcastle been very good this season, looking forward to them coming to Villa Park soon as I think it'll be a great game
West Ham took a right hammering tonight
We (Newcastle) are a weird team, batter teams but can't finish so end up drawing but tonight were poor overall but finishing was lethal and scored 5, madness but I love it lol
Comedy defence from waist ham 🤣😂
2:12 Moyes is praying 😅
Hard kid at 0:42 😂😂😂😂
Could be some more managers for the boot before the week is over.
Honesty WHU fans can't blame Moyes for this game, what on earth are the defenders and goalie doing for 3 out of 5 goals. Pub league mistakes that Newcastle professionally finished off.
2:40 I like the shot of Isak and Fabianski both putting their hands on their hips next to each other as the ball slowly bounces in 😂
Isaks goal was brilliant calm and collected,
Fair play, Newcastle dominance from a utd fan
Are West Ham for real? Good win for Eddie Howe's boys.
Loool only God knows what we’ll do to West Ham next weekend loooool🔴⚪️💪🏾
Fully believe top 4 is a cert. Please forgive me for hoping Arsenal get something when we play you guys but no doubt you get that. No matter what you have a top top team….. Good luck….
Get moyes out
Kurt zouma is low key one of the most overrated players in the whole league.
Moves should retire from football management seriously
Cracking performance
David Moyes at the wheel
Newcastle picked up momentum at the right time whilst the others around the top 4 are faltering. Huge for them to get Champions League so soon into the new ownership. Exciting times
class performance. Newcastle being clinical???? feel like im dreaming
West Ham got the 🐱 treatment
The funny thing is we (Newcastle) were absolutely rubbish in the 1st half despite scoring twice. Bit better in the 2nd half but still not amazing. West Ham gifted us a bunch of the goals.
Wow a var decision went our way 4 once
Moyes out rodger in
Hammers hammered? Bubbles popped? Step it up, sky
How is David moyes still a manager for this club
The Toons fitness and work ethic and pressure punished the Hammers and we weren’t at our highest level, some sloppy passing and we still swept them aside.. Big Joe was awesome and to have 2 strikers on fire wow ….
Hope Newcastle gets Champions league next year what a turnaround!
If West Ham get relegated it's back to their fans going on about Bobby Moore again. We had a break for a couple of years of that.
Some would say we hammered them 😂
Eddie Howe is doing a great job, i hope he gets to spend a lot of money and lead newcastle into this new era. Come to england soon 👏🙏
west ham and leicester might actually get relegated
And the board is still backing moyes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Prime arsenal “Flapianski” turned up tonight
Wtf was that defence performance
Worst refereeing performance I’ve ever seen
up the mags lad!!!  We are absolutely flying at the minute and i dare say the best team in the league at the minute.  Incredible. from where we where just a year ago to now.  It is truly magical time to be a magpie  HWTL!!!! 🖤🤍
Amazing result,what a season we are having,full of confidence,everyone working hard for each absolutely fantastic HWTL ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
Fabianski had a horror show today
Shocking performance from west ham. Moyes surely has to go now.
Highly embarrssing for West Ham, pub team errors at times!
Big steps towards top 4. Started winning at the right time
Are they still booing Zouma about the cat incident?
Justice for Zouma's cat
Bye Moyes
Hopefully they don't sack him before the Arsenal game
Wow 6 goals in 3 minutes must be a record
Isak putting his hands on his hips whilst waiting for the ball to go in is brilliant😂
Come on lads what a performance 👏
I genuinely wish Arsenal signed Isak....so so good!!!
As an Arsenal fan, please West Ham just hold onto Moyes for another couple of weeks. Please
West Ham are a soft touch
West Ham fans leaving 15 minutes before the end is a poor sight mind, I know we hammered them (pardon the pun) but I thought they had a stronger fan base than that... ⚫️⚪️
Peak. Time to goooooo
Fabianski thanks for the free FPL points 😅
Now are people gonna start putting RESPECT on our name 👏
Raise a hand if u love Newcastle ✋
Yep Newcastle at the San Siro is happening
This team <3
That was an embarrassing effort from the hammers!
Oh my god, that assist for the first goal. He left him.😂
Moyes will be the next manager to go 👀
Ouch
Crazy to think how far Newcastle have come even with all this money there veterans are still performing.
Newcastle need a documentary this season like
Should be age restricted
How the hell did Joelington transform himself to barely a footballer to genuinely one of the most consistent CMs in the league?? 😂
# 281st
Great 👍 back from Newcastle ❤
Moise has to be sacked tonight surely.
Such a good Newcastle United hammered the hammers😂
West Ham getting relegated if they keep Moyes
12 managers have been sacked so far ( a new record) how long are we gonna give it then before it becomes unlucky 13 for David moyes
Eddie Howe is the best English manager hands down 🙌
We got a bit lucky with referee calls and two of the goals but still what a great result! Europe here we come!
Eddie Howe deserves manager of the year
Eddie Howe has done a brilliant job this season with Newcastle. As a gooner, they have me very worried next season...
West Ham hooooonk man, terrible team
wow, what a match
Bye bye moyes
Callum Wilson is in amazing form 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Newcastle are the best I’ve seen since keegan.
Joelinton deserves so much more credit for how good he is. At striker he was a liability but now he's transformed his career by becoming a centre mid and probably one of the top 10 in the league in his position! Callum Wilson is also criminally underrated
West Ham are in the mud!!
Antonio and Wilson in the next pod will be fun 😂
First
the transformation of Newcastle is INSANE
Championship here we come ⚒
Yo
newcastle are massive
Get in.
Honestly I think we are going down. For weeks we’ve just been expecting us to lose every match for weeks and everyone can see why
newcaslte had an absolute amazing performance
Gave them a pasting
Tf
West Ham man why are we so bad 😭 Mags we needed points more, you guys already in a CL spot 😭you coulda just given us a draw 😂
Ez
Rice is embarrassing. Please keep him away from United
Sky showed this game & left United game with no tv broadcast, turned out to be a very good decision 1-0 compared to 5-1, great win for toons
First
