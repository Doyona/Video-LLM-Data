NOTIFICATION SQUAD: You may have already seen or heard about this in Sharla's video or various reaction parodies, but I thought I should talk about it myself! I don't want a lot of surprised viewers later on down who missed the previous announcement! And a big thank you to everyone for the kind words 🍻
Imperialist marries another imperialist
Just at the end of your book and you suddenly mention a Charlotte (I'm listening so that's what I heard) and I'm like, wait who the Hell is Charlotte!   Turns out it's actually Sharla. You really don't focus on your romantic relationships in the book. 😂
help. where on earth is the vdo in which chris and sharla trade accents??
2:09 Appearance fee… u😂😂😂
Hi, I am from UK. You two look great together ;)
"i am not gay" says gayest man ever
"Why I'm Dating a Canadian" has a similar vibe to "Why I've converted to [religion]"
She’s not lying 😂
but does your girlfriend know?
lmao i seriously just found out today you two were together. i just got invested in watching so many videos about you two
You know who didn't think Chris was gay? Straight guys.
Nagski is simply the best
Can you speak Canadian
Allergies are fake But the gayness is not
1:13   Me and roger are david!!!
As far as the cat thing goes - many people with allergies can acclimate. You're still allergic to cats; but you're no longer allergic to this*specific* cat (once your body has acclimated). For me it usually takes about 2-4 weeks of exposure; then I'm good.
Only now i realised they cheered so hard is because they had an oopsie on trash taste and spilled the beans :D
Chris is that defensive about his homosexuality. He’s even allergic to pussy. What else can he say to prove his relationship with Connor. I wish you were all more accepting of his sexuality so he could be honest without you all judging him ...
Chris: I feel Sorry for Connor   Me: Then Explain me Why did he do a Herculean Effort for Raising 1 Million Dollars to Charity and for Immune Deficiency Foundation for the Feisty Latina Women Ironmouse and that too on a Cyclethon I mean it's also a type of a relationship for supporting one another atleast.   Tho not in a Relationship phase but atleast they are supporting eachother is the most important and amazing thing despite all that mouse has gone through but hopefully mouse can have fun with Connor just like you two Chris and Sharla, also Congrats for the Cyclethon Achievement tho. It's an incredible feat and I am proud to be in the community around you guys.  This is an incredible year already 😅.
don't cut down meat, cut down everything else
8:50 Why would you cut out meat? What's the point in living then?
You bloody effin bastard!!! I'm so happy for you and Charlotte!!! Now i wish your relationship could help the Japanese build and work in relationship and stop relying on cafes, animes and idols for their sexual and personal needs, and START MAKING BABIES!!!!!
I don't care if Sharla was from the moon she is cute AF you are a lucky man and the title of this video is dumb... and yes I'm a year late, because YOU don't post as many videos as you used to.   We need more Natsuki! (and Sharla booty)   :)     blame the vodka.
Damn, wow...I don't know how poor conor will rebound from this information....
Canadian women are the best!
actually cant believe anyone gives a flying fuck about this shit..
Hahaha I watched your 2000km vid with her looking at you and knew that you and her will start dating
They may be less allergenic cats
Chris you’re an awesome dude. Ive been watching you for years and always thought you and Sharla had amazing chemisty. It seems meant to be! so happy for you guys!!
Never thought Chris was gay. Norm on the other hand…
Canada mixed Americans with French people and somehow created the nicest people.
Get tested for Cooties
Maybe you can teach her somewhat real English.
9:20 Meat is healthy and good for you, don't let her tell you otherwise.
My cat allergy also went away once I had cats. Very interesting. I never thought or could even imagine that Chris and Connor were dating. Can't figure out why anyone would think they were dating. And if Connor doesn't shower I don't see him having and boyfriend or girlfriend.
How can you be around Naski so much and not be tempted to be gay 🤣
You're NOT GAY? wtf why do you say you are all the time
Chris' American accent is spot on😂
So, that means Connor is single now? I wonder if he'll have his restraining order lifted. I swear I've changed.
I know I'm late to the party, but I hope you to get married so she's gonna be Sharla In Japan In Japan
“No I’m not gay and I’ve not nothing against anyone being a gay.” - Chris Broad 😅👍
Don't have to be gay to date a dude as a man... There is that thing called BISEXUALITY! ...just kidding Chris, but as a bi lady myself, I hate it when that option is not mentioned. You can swing both ways. Just saying.
That's great your dating a Canadian. We are awesome. I find when you have cat allergies that if your around that cat you get use to them. My sister in law cat doesn't bother me.
3:24 sharlas "cat" 😂😂
Not been gay is not a option!
Don't cut on meat for health, meat is healthy. Cut sugar and carbs, especially flour products and deep-fried foods, and eat more vegetables.
I knew it. You two are adorable.
his pete personation was hilarious lol
its funny because a few years ago i watched a few of your videos with sharla in them and thought "i wonder if they're dating" then told myself i shouldnt assume just bc you're guy/girl friends that you're dating... now you're dating lmao
Lol. Such a rude, arrogant, selfish man. But with this female you are like a pussy cat??? What? Cat eats your tongue Chris??? You behave very weird! Apparently she is the boss!🤪
So happy for you guys.
Damn, there goes that opportunity. 😢
I’ve lived in East Asia for 26 years, and while I’ve dated many women here, I would never marry one. I get it. The cross culture thing is just too much, driving me crazy.
The Royals rang. If you date a Cdn hoser you will lose your royal status and be excommunicated, banished to Canada.  No wait, thats not you…
Please tell me anyone how Chris's subscribers are now less than before?
I thought you were dating Natsuki.
Holy crap, you actually pulled off a pretty good American accent!
That American Pete impression is always spot on😂😂😂
I was sure all this time my hero, my YouTube hero is NOT gay !!!!  Hope you two guys will marry up one day ! All the best, from the bottom of my heart !
Q: how did you start dating? Chris: I dunno. It just kinda happened. Sharla: will have the exact date and time, place and song playing at that moment.
I love that "Connor not showering" is more important to Chris than him not actually being gay ... priorities.
Bro why is your impression of Pete so good 😂
I mean...Banff in Scotland is nice too....
you can now rename your channel Two Broads in Japan
Everyone's talking about the relationship, and not enough people are talking about that spot-on Pete impression.
As someone who follows a Twitch cooking channel Adatenightin... They are  couple who have two cats and the guy is allergic to cats, shellfish & seafood. They have two cats and the allergies do go away with time.
Connor reaction is the best "THANK GOD ❤" 😂 really happy for you!!
Because you like her...what other reason do you need?
Because you're successful now.
I haven't seen your videos in a long time, but the ?studio? your in is so cool!!!!
Fuck - I had a feeling you two were dating or would be a good couple - then somehow miss this absolute bombshell.  Will you make a collaborated channel Called "Married in Japan" for when the knot is fully tied?
The more you get around cats the less allergic you'll be. I was very allergic to our cat at first but now it doesn't bother me. My eyes would swell shut and I'd get skin rash 🙄😬 thank God that's over though
Candy man. Should ve gone as Sugar Man
The best cure for a cat allergy is getting a cat. I always used to have mild but irritating allergic reactions to my friends' cats until about a month after having to look after one myself (she was a stray, no home, nowhere else to stay: I couldn't say no). I very quickly built up a tolerance, plus she also caught a mouse in my flat on her first night living with me so she'd earned her keep right there and then.  Incidentally I believe you are now legally obligated to try poutine at least once if you haven't already. It's some weird obscure Canadian law about dating Canadians apparently, and one I'm sure Canadians in the comments will be able to confirm.
A couple of cats didn't inflict allergy on me, while a couple of dogs did and I'm not allergic to dogs! Also I've been around these dogs for years and suddenly started sneezing.  Allergy is a curse that can be passed on.
My takeaway from this video : Love cures cat allergies
https://youtu.be/dBP0Mbc7VFw "My girlfriend's a vegetarian which pretty much makes me a vegetarian."
congrats chris and sharla! :)
Sharla and Chris have obvious chemistry - I knew they liked each other. Congratulations, lovely couple xxxxx
ほんとにクリスとシァラがデート？！
It’s just a cover for dating Ryotoro
Who cares....
But if you WERE gay. Would you date this Conner fellow?
The stream is no longer available??
So cute 🥰
And now they took their collab to yet another level by getting engaged.
They just got engaged
She's a golden girl. Wish you guys luck!
I have cat allergies as well, but we have 2 that I quickly adapted to with little issue. Also, male cats have less dander, so allergies aren’t as bad if you have males.
i thought Chris was gay
Take that thing out of your hair! 😊😋😎
WoOoW! Had been off for the last 2 years, and started watching what I missed. This one is a surprise, but not really a big one. Because oftentimes when you and Sharla appeared together in videos, I thought you have some deeper-connection. So, all I can say is: Congrats and good luck!
Victoria is a great place. Some of the best restaurants in Canada due to their tourism industry from cruise ships stopping along the way to Alaska. If you get there highly recommend a whale tour to see orcas
Stealing us great Canadians! Shame on you!
You guys are so perfect for each other, two of the nicest people on the planet together couldn't be better 👊
Chris is gay for sure.
A broad - Sharla - in Japan. It was destined to happen
Although interestingly  enough if you have a british citzenship I belive your re allowed a 2 year visa work without having to apply for a visa as long as you can prove british citizenship
Did you give her a cup of noodle at a love hotel
I assumed you were dating her because Canada is/was a British colony and you just claimed her as your property.
Bro has got the rizzler
You can't monetize the break-up if you don't make it public first. Needs an easy-to-follow story arc. Wonder who is gonna be the villain in this one
I've never seen a "not-gay" person try so hard to claim he is not gay. I think Shakespeare had some witty remark about that
Why is "Canadian" made out to be the only significant trait in that discussion? Do people need to justify dating a "Canadian" like they would confess to dating a transgender/Muslim/anime pillow/teenager?  Is it at all worth talking about a Brit dating a Canadian? Might as well say "yes, I'm dating a woman". It's more telling to say that he's dating some youtube-chick
I really dont understand why anyone gives a fuck who you're dating.  e-celeb fanbois need to become an hero
Hi Chris you looked so handsome in that photo with Sharia while you were so much slimmer!!
Abroad in japan has been a favorite channel. When I first visited japan I stayed at pippins inn making it my favorite place to stay. I then see sharla goes in on Nekko Nekko inn with the owner from Pippin's inn. NOW CHRIS IS DATING SHARLA? long shot ask, if I book Nekko Nekko inn does it earn one photo with you? think about it. :)
Wow I'm so behind, congrats guys
I saw this coming years ago when she was married. But adults gonna adult.
"my family lives in Montreal... she's from Vancouver. It's very convenient!"   Oh, buddy. Those are literal other sides of the country.
O_O
Dating a friend is good advice
We LOVE SHARLA ❤
Your Pete impression was spot on!
Sharla: I'm dating Chris.  everyone: *loses their collective minds*  _NO PRESSURE!_
It was all those love hotel vids lmfao 😂
This was a surprise to noone haha
Congrat to you both.
Recolonize the upstart nations
lmao i mean i personally thought connor was gay i thought he said he was in one of his various videos unless he was joking and then "working " at the various gay, or idk what they call them where you he went and did the like boyfriend experience where he shared a stick of poki w some dude rofl, "for a day" and did QUITE a few videos about the topic lol he really just gives off the vibe, i didn't think Chris was but connor for sure
It was all those hot tub scenes with Joey and Connor. Lol!
WOW, it's just líke Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell!
i love when sharla said its datin time and start dating chris ll over the place
Why is it that your annoying (aka Canadian) girlfriend is posting more videos with you in them you are making your own. Your format is far more entertaining.
Your beard is really pretty!
Conor comments 😂😂😂😂 love it
But why Chris? U blind? Xd
Wholesomeness, wholesomeness everywhere!
I thought i was the only one who thought that Chris and Connor were dating
I totally agree with the "date your best friend" advice... It took me 10 years until my best male friend and me became a couple. It´s great as a lot of early relationship struggles simply don´t happen... Simple things like unintentionally farting when your partner is in the same room simply doesn´t matter if you know him for many years before. In our case my female best friend told me that we behave like a couple of 3 years when we just dated for 3 months, which was kinda funny.
The reason you have no severe allergy to these cats is because they look like they may well be Siberian cats. This breed have less (or none) of the allergen found in cats saliva. The fur holds the allergen and its transfered to your skin or up your nose if you breath in particles of dander. We have a Siberian cat 👍👍
Where r the Korea blogs!?
Cheers Chris!
Natski’s that dude. If he was ever in my neck of the woods, I’d look out for him.
😍
Connor is also a friend. Y didn't U date Connor?
As the man, Chris wears the pants in the relationship.     Sharla just tells Chris which pants to wear....
After 6wks, his appendix went haha
where did his checkmark go? did something happen ? :c (also congrats on the relationship!)
I figured that Connor and Chris dating was a community inside joke because they were clearly friends having a good/miserable time. I guess I was wrong about everyone being in on the joke. I mean, Chris being ironmouse is an inside joke, right?... right?
Congratulations on your relationship I am wishing you both the very best.
W
2:37 LOOOL Chris is the funniest British guy on YouTube without even trying 😂😂😂
Is that a headband?
When you realize you can write romantic dinners off as a business meeting. Well played.
So you’re saying you’re gay? O_o
Grats, been watching you both on and off for years. Keep eating a healthy diet so I don't have to.
Manlyke
It's a awesome thing when the girl your with is your best friend I've always said now binge the umaru
It's okay Chris We support you no matter Sharla or Connor
💓💓💓😎😎😎💞💞💞
this is the peak male performance
You damn did it my boy
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
Och nooo. Chris is my yt crush :(
I never thought that Chris was gay, but Sharla was sort of inevitable.  She is kind of nice.  Conor never really had a chance competing with Sharla! LOL
If you are inclined to do another documentary, I am very interested in learning more about the Ainu people of Japan.
Sounds like a good reason to celebrate at big boy. Though for a real treat have some rainbow red kiwi.
Glad to see you guys are happy, fingers crrossed it all works out!!
How long is "awhile"? :)  (I don't have IG so my comments are on YT)
Yes Chris you mad dog! I always knew there was chemistry there since your older videos with her and to see it become a reality is amazing. I wish you guys the best! 🎉
Where did he put the original stream?
The year is 2035. Chris has released the first episode of his "Journey Across Canada" Series, Its titled "The Legend Of Maple Syrup" Second one might be "Is The Bacon, Really Canadian?"
I thought them dating was obvious
Thought you were dating her all along...she’s a doll.  You’re a good blend.
Are you seriously certain that you wouldn't date Conner, if you could get him to take a shower?  Anyway visas for Canada get a more favourable input, if a Maple Leaf national is involved.
Finally A Broad in Japan finally has A Broad. Lol
Love how Conner not showering ranks above not being gay as arguments for not dating him hahaha.
i see the chemistry
Congratulations to you and Sharla x
this video be like: Connor Taking  A Phat  L
I thought that too, lol
I thought you and Daniel Lord were long time lovers….you met in grammar school and were joined at the hip for all time.
YESS. I agree with you. One of the most important things that a relationship must have is friendship. It's not really about knowing each other prior (although that helps too) but the fact that you can both hang out and have a lot of things to do and talk about together.
Congrats chris and sharla!
omg been waiting for this for like years LOLOLOL yayayayayayayay!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dear Chris, PLEASE put the full stream back up!
Yessssss
Definitely makes you feel happier, wish you the best.
2 months late to the party.. BUT I ALWAYS KNEW! you sneaky little devils you! it's been in the air FOR YEARS! xD. Thank god it's finally out and about though! WOOP WOOOP!
I just caught this.  Congratulations.
My boy finally becomes a man, kudos to you Chris.
Truely happy for you Chris and Charlotte! 🎉
If you break her heart this Canadian will come over and break your ,,, something. I live in Montreal too!
So that’s why sharla was in the background for most of the time in cycle across Japan
I was wondering when this would happen for years!
Yay, new on screen guest!
Tokyo Lens Norm has summoned your affability! Rise to the occasion!
Bloody brilliant Chris
Consider your self a luck man.... May be you may not be such a miserable git. But do your self a favour and keep it off social media, other wise it may crash!
Chris Junior, when?
Hey Chris! Can you do a short video talking about the warning sirens that are going off in Japan ⚠️
I kind of figured this was the case. Happy you both were comfortable enough to go public with it.
Just watched "Cat Nation".  Not sure why everyone gives you guff over it.   Was pretty solid.
Considering you woke up together searching for Fuji .. not a surprise. Probably broke up right after the roller coaster and she’s finally forgiven.
Thank goodness for that. It was painful waiting
awesome Chris !!!
Press F for Connar
I think you introduced yourself to maro which is why you can be around her cats no problem. Try with another cat and see if that's the issue. It's great you can be around her cats
fucking noice!!!
Canada's benefit: Land, a LOT of it.  And clean unpolluted waters and fish.
I just realized chris looks a tiny bit like elon musk  You got billionaire features, chris!
Counting the days until Chris record a video saying he swapped her for Connor, but he kept the cat
I'm really happy for you 2. Sounds like you've been in love for some time now, like 6 years? Dating sounds like the right moveee.
"Cat Nation 2" with Sharla and Chris. :D 💞
You are so smart to be dating a Canadian woman.  Greetings from Victoria BC🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
My heart is so fuzzy finding out you guys are together officially I’m so happy for you both I wish you good luck and all the support ❤❤❤
Woohoo Congrats guys 🎉 🙌🏼🙌🏼 ummm I did suspect this a while back actually…..
Oh, I thought you were gay…
This is sooo bad that you to are dating?
Joey has Aki Garnt has Sydney Chris now has Sharla and Connor's there like "all I need is my Jojo"
Very nice sr
Hope all is well Chris?
I thought the relationship with Connor was two dudes buds professional and straight. Connor is a friend and a odd couple match like Abbott and Costello.
British and Canadian. In Japan. Totally awesome.
After years date with Asians, white person  dates same race (just Caucasians) 😳🙊 I fell sad because I am Asian as well🥹
Chris broad the 4th shadow member of trash taste
love the immediate transition from "i'm not gay" to "i'm allergic to pussy"
Natsky is the man he comes off very genuine and that’s rare.
Aye vancouver island ftw!
Wait... Is this real? I though she said that as sarcasm so people would stop shipping her with her friends. And this video doesn't help, it just seems like more sarcasm, and British sarcasm is already the best and most difficult to see through, when you join the Broad effect is ewen harder to get if this is all a hell of a big amazing joke or a freaking amazing new. Argh! But as I continue to see the video is like... Sinking in... They're dating 👁️👄👁️
I've had cats my entire life with cat allergies. Long haired cats are way better for me, something about shorthair cats seems to make me have allergies. Same with my parents dogs who are short fur.  I'll say this it does improve over time, I used to get some allergies with long hair too primarily my eyes would itch, haven't had that happen since I was a kid and I'm now 37 so it's been around 25yrs.  Regarding Chris and Connor being gay, I always thought it was very clear they were just two straight guys going to visit love hotels together... Oh wait... ;)  I'm from Montreal too. Have heard amazing things about Banff. Congrats on the happy relationship.
It seems that they are relieved that you have started dating.. 😇
Your impression of Pete was amazing!
If the cat allergies flare up again, and Sharla doesn't already have one/more than one, I highly recommend getting those small standing HEPA air filters. They help a TON with cat allergies, it won't completely negate the cat dander but it's probably the single best thing you can do to alleviate the issue aside from taking medication constantly, haha.
Go on cold ones with Max mofo and Chad
Connor doesn't shower because he's constantly having baths.
the cat allergy thing is a "sneeze the first week and be immune the rest of the year thing.
OMG Joey just had a pantsu-shot
I remember watching AIJ videos featuring Sharla and thinking how the two of you have chemistry and just click with one another. I am so glad for you both and I hope this will be the best relationship the both of you have ever had. What I am most happy about though, is that Sharla will hopefully influence your eating pattern and make you a healthier individual overall😂
Chris! meat is healthy!  please check out foodlies!
Connor in the background crying🤣
They had been giving off that dating vibe since she was single again
The way you two established your relationship is really healthy. It happened naturally over time. Happy for the both of you. <3
I knew it :D , she is gold ! I am happy for you guys :)
Chris , I am a fairly new subscriber. I have been watching older videos of Abroad in Japan. I came across the video  ( Mount Fuji ruined my day ) with Sharla. From that video I made the prediction , these two are either dating or they will be eventually.  Because their is no way a guy can make a female do something that she really does not want to do , without her really liking him deep down . Congratulations to you both!
The cat allergy thing is true. I've experienced the same thing and now we have 5 cats lol
Did you hear what happened to the queen?!?
That's really the point of typical allergies. The reason you develop them (the common kinds, like peanuts) is because you were never used to them; for example, peanut allergies are higher in children/cultures where they don't get a taste of it early on. So you can build your immunity towards it little by little (at least on the mundane allergies).
I don't really follow, didn't Sharla used to have a Korean Boyfriend or Something? what actually happened?
Congratulations man
Changing diet?? No more chicken boy?? Nooooooo
It's ok to be gay, Chris, and you and Connor are a cute couple. Per every girl on dating sites now, everyone is poly or some other shit I've never heard of, so seems likely that you are too.
you guys are so cute <3
I'm so happy for you two! And can confirm, dating a friend is amazing. I started dating my friend from 10 years last year, it is the best relationship I have ever been in. Not sure how/when we crossed the line as well... But I'm so glad we did. 🧡
Free Marple Sirup for life. Congratulations.
I freaking knew it
Finally... the relationship  i was hoping to happen has finally came true... ever since i started watching your first journey across japan and saw sharla in it, i sub to her as well and was wondering how come those 2 are not dating...happy for you both. 😁
YAS!!!!
Looks like a cover up to me but is he doing her? I date the fu$k out of her, she’s a babe
So no more Brokeback Mountain with Connor?
It was inevitable, you always had great chemistry in the Journey across Japan vids.
She is amazing. Congrats to both of you.
So sweet! Best relationship he ever had 🥰💕💕❤️💕
Beef is bad. Veggies are best-est-ness! Join us! Resistance is futile. Heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are knocking at your mortal coil! Seriously, life is short. Try what you want and (in moderation) when you want the goodliness of sinful consumables. Nom-nom-nom...
congrats you two!
Long haired cats typically don't affect people with cat allergies.
Roger and Dave eh
Probably her cats dont lick that much. People are alergic to cat saliva not cats
Since Canada belongs to the queen, I think the question is whether Sharla sees any benefits of/from dating a British guy.
Me and a friend are def staying at her Inn when we go!
Been watching you for 6 years, Chris, and I couldn't be happier for you (and Sharla). Congrats!
Congrats to the both of you and much success in the future
About bloody time....  Is what the majority of people will be thinking.  You guys had great chemistry together in the videos you've both been in.   Here's to hoping for a long-lasting and happy relationship, good Sir.
Congratulations for making good entertainment for so long. I wish you both much happiness.
Whoo! Yay, for dating a Canadian. I live right by Banff and it'd be really cool to see you do a video there and get your perspective on it.
Ok, To be honest... You got in to  a relationship.. I hope it work out and all that, But keep your content going mate.... And you wont get a visa, you will get maple sirup :D And I agree... Date a friend :)
My man didnt even mentio Ryotaro as a best man candidate.
Im just imaging 7 years ago Chris is like sticking the candies onto himself in front of a mirror and then after hes done  "Brilliant"  and then heads to the party LOL
Banff is amazing and Montreal
My dreams of moving to Japan and having you fall in love with me have come crashing down 😭😅😭😅
Nice.
wow that was a good impersernation
Love that he’s talking about his lovely serious relationship while sporting some doc brown style visor lighting up his head 😂
Not gay? Seriously? Does that mean I just have to throw out the window all my fan fics about you and Connor? No way, big disappointment 😕
I've had vibes for ages that this was a thing :D
Glad for you both. I guess we could see the first signs when you made your first videos together... maybe?
She must be very fond of all things chicken.
I FUCKING KNEW IT
How come we never met any Japanese girlfriends?
I knew it! Happy for you two!
Everyone knows Canadians are the best.  If only women here knew that. -_-
& on the next episode of how I met your mother, friends make better lovers
All the best for your relationship mate!
I totally called this during the bike across Japan series. Not publicly in the comments, but definitely in my brain. Good work!
I've been to Banff!! Such a beautiful place in Canada!
3:38 I too have a cat allergy but its only triggers by new cats or when my cats are shedding and I don't clean all the fur in time. My theory is that my body just gets used to a particular cat and its fine with them but my body needs time with new cats.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I shipped you two since 2020 lol
I knew it!  Oh My!  She seems like a great catch!  What a sweet girl.  Wish BOTH of you the best.
Abroad in japan with a broad in japan
I used to have a severe allergy to cats and it just completely disappeared. I would react by just touching them.
Chris is gay, sharla is a beard.
TOTALY UNRELATED COMMENT: Chris, can you speak fluent Japanese? Really liking the videos 👍
As someone who've seen ... people, the reactions at 0:06 were really badly exaggerated at best and fully faked with some other stuff behind them at worst.
You're lucky. Not even gonna lie, not in a billion years of everything could I imagine you two being together.
You two always seemed to click so well in the content you did together, I was hoping a romance might come eventually because I just want you guys to be happy :)
Sharla was married already? WTF !?  FYI I've never seen her channel so I didn't know.
2:50 Bi maybe but definitely not gay lmao. If ya'll don't remember or just recently subbed, he dated that one Japanese girl early on during his first years in Japan and first years of the channel.
Sharla is a cutie!
He...likes cats now
LOVED the outro screen!!
She has a cute smile.
Is it a british thing to have only one best man? In France you can have way more best man or "Témoins".
Cohabitation?
Cats' fur is covered with their saliva which also has their dander. I am thinking that your exposures have been increasing and thus your antibodies. There is a good chance that your cat allergy will disappear because allergies change as you age. Congratulations!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!! sooo happy for Chris and Sharla!!  😭🙏🥳🎉💞
If you get married I want connor to BURST in and object, It´d be the funniest shit.
Getting closer to your famous birthdays rival so you can keep tabs on their fame rank? I can dig it.
You said you had a date with a man 🤷🏻‍♂️
About time... Marry her you fool
I'M SOOOOOO happy for...she's really HOT..congratulations you've got a winner!!!!
Definitely agree with dating someone you’ve know for a while. My fiancé and I were best friends for nearly a decade before we started dating, now we’re engaged and about to have our first child ❤️
It was about time! congrats you two :D
Although I'm some random fan on the internet. I truly am happy to hear you two found each other and are happy. AND that you didn't do the whole social media blast and like figured stuff out before "announcing" it in your video.  I hope it works out between the both of you. I enjoy both you and Sarmeleon's content. So win win all around.
This is surely no surprise to anyone. Except Connor... And Chris... ...And Sharla...
7:00  Chris dressed as the candy daddy
hahahha alright fck yesss congrats .. sharla is amazing .. i hope your relationsgip will stay amazing as it is now till forever :D
I LOVE THIS...you two have great chemistry on video so it is nice to know you are dating..
"The reason we didn't talk about it.."  Real answer:  because it's no one's fucking business
Why do you think you have to cut out meat from your diet to be healthier, I’m not saying you have to go full keto to get in shape, but don’t blame meat for what bread and sugar did. a bucket of fried chicken isn’t healthy because of the breading and the oil it was fried in, not because of the meat. Of course if you want to cut it from your diet for moral reasons, that’s your choice, but I’m just saying you won’t necessarily be healthier for it. a lot of vegan food is highly processed garbage
You have to buy milk in bags now
I KNEW IT
Congrats dude!!! Also where did you get those light up glasses?
Never thought you were gay, people are so easy to label.   You have a great friendship with a man that doesn’t make you gay
Such a waste- I figured they each would TRY to date people born/raised in Japan. (dates another youtuber lol) XDDD but it is fine if that's the best they can do. uwu -pats pats-
Cheers to you two!! Also, hi Sharla! It's Q from back home!
does this mean your not going to love hotels any more with connor? 😥
all these youtubers dating each other 🤫
I knew it! Saw that chemistry on the never-ending bike ride of hell lol
oh yeah, now i 1st have to find a friend & after another 5-10 years she maybe left me because we are both to old to do anything :D  yay what a great future :D
I don't get it. Why? If you want to start a family it's going to be risky. Geriatric pregnancy is harsh.  You live in Asia you could easily get a asian girl.  But, heart wants what it want gl to you both.  Generally older women who had their pick of  men in their 20s go for the nice men later on.  Be careful think logically and make sure your in it. She seems like a very sweet girl make sure you have the full picture tho.
Wishing you 2 all the best and you are adorable together! Would be nice to see each of you in each other's videos more as well because I love all the old ones you did together =)
I had a feeling you two were dating, which is funny to say I guess lol I'm so happy for ya'll!
I'm so happy for the both of you, congrats!
Chris on Canada these days: "is it good, is it nice?" All of the redpills in the audience: "I'd rather die"
Chris you have to tell people you are European. Americans mix up gays like me and Europeans like you ;)
It’s just nobody’s facking business really…. Nor do we give a fack
Has she apologised for Bryan Adams?
Allergies can go away over time...I used to be horribly allergic to cats, dogs, everything outside. All good now.
LETSSS GOOOO!!! “Abroad in Canada!”
Akidearet & Joey can advise you on going public with a relationship - the next stage is "When are getting Married?!"  So, when?
Prime reason Chris won't date Connor: He doesn't shower.  The fact that Chris isn't gay comes second.  .... Okay..
I’d be thrilled to be your wedding photographer when/if that day comes 😎👍🏼 - my portfolio: www.tracephotostudio.com
I really liked this video! It's very... hopeful. A British guy abroad, dating a Canadian girl, who is also abroad. Very much what I hope my life will become 😂😂
Longhaired cats ironically don’t shed like mediums, my sisters cat I’m fine with, my own cat I’m on prescribed antihistamines and clean everything daily 🤦🏼‍♀😅
I hate to be dramatic but i am so damn happy that both of my very favorite YouTubers got together😭❤❤❤
So happy for u, this is my first comment on any YouTuber in years.
Does this mean there won't be any Love hotel revierws with Connor from now on :( ?
is this real or for the views? this is crazy. like 10 years? lol.
Just I found out now. Congratulations 👏. She is my favorite YouTuber as Creator.
lol i knew it fromthe 1st vid u put togheter
Omgggg this is my most favorite anime shipping eeeeever!!! How do I only know about this now when I watch both your channels since forever ago and didn’t notice anything???? ♥️😊😊😊 so happy for you!!’
CDawg just having a rave in the bottom there
Congrats to the both of you. Hope it goes smoothly forever! ...that's the dream, right? lol
Gratz
If anyone ever asks you to do an American accent, please just do that Pete impression again! XD
i knewwwwwwwwwwwwww it . congrates my dude
oh man, I am sorry. I was routing for you and CDawg. So, does this mean CDawg is on the market again??? Just asking for a friend. lol
That's a solid Pete impression, mate.
Cool! The videos that you two are in are some of my favorites, so don't muck it up - either of you! Lol
CONGRATULATIONS 👏  thanks for sharing this part of your life with us
We did it bois! The ship has set sail! The chemistry you two had on screen was just too good to be wasted. Yes, the ship gods have heard my prayers.
Good luck to you both x
Lucky girl x
The Trash Taste Reaction was not real, guys. Come on. It's already all over the place.
I’m taking that costume idea
I was not allergic for 19 years, then I was. To cats. Had cats all my life, went to Canada and came back allergic. Did she steal my immunity and gave it to you?
Congratulations :)
Omg!!! I had a feeling when I saw y’all’s chemistry in a video from a little while back. I wasn’t sure though. That’s awesome I’m so happy for you guys!
Wish you all the luck.
Chris: "Maybe I gave off gay vibes" *wears flashing rainbow headband*
Poor girl, being blackmailed into dating... ;)
🤣🤣🤣
How much did Chris have to pay sharla to say they were dating
I ship it♡ Congratulations!♡♡♡
Awesome! ive been waiting for this for years 😁
What about Ryatro as the best man? "British Japanese guy"  ( I know I probably spelled his name wrong)
Have a drink every time Chris say "I'M NOT GAY"
Canadian fan here, Chris! Well Chris, you don't need a visa to visit Canada, as you have a UK passport. You could apply for "landed immigrant" status even if you weren't dating a Canadian, so no, it doesn't really help! Also, Victoria is a bit of a ways away from Montreal, mate! It's about 3726.65 km! So, not exactly a nice afternoon walk, or a short drive! Flying inside Canada is also quite expensive (small market, fewer travelers...capitalism!). So...the main benefit is you're dating someone who's cool, and you've known for a long time, so unlikely to be any "red flag" surprises! Hope she's the one!
with cat allergies, typically you will get used to your own cat whilst still being allergic to other cats!! i have no idea how it works tbf
Punching above your (fried chicken enhanced) weight a bit there Chris :p !  Joking aside, good on ya, hope things work out great.
very nice
I think it's really intresting how some alergiers can go away with frequint exposure. Did you know that thoose red marks you get from (mosskitos) are an alergic shock and that if you get bitten hundreds of times daily for over half a year you won't have a reaction.
I called it about a year ago when you did a few videos together I said to my gf they are definitely dating
Chris! i thought you were gay!  that'a a surprise...
didn't she have a bf in previous videos? But I thought something was odd, she obviously was superflirting with you.
Title of your sextape; Abroad in Sharla
I´ve known my boyfriend for 10 years and now we are together since 3 years and every day is better than the other. we´ve known every of our secrets and we´ve been there for each other in hard times, when we´ve been rejected etc. we´ve been meeting each other every few months, tho we´ve been only half an hour apart. but it was ok. kinda like the movie `harry and sally` It was the best start you can get. the trust was already there. so, yeah, all the best for you two, I kinda feel this relationship.
The star of this video are those glasses. Congratulations!
how about we have a fake marriage so i can stay in japan like mr wick and drew carey lol
It was kinda known when yall did the black romin thing lol least I had a feeling she was def into you props chris :)
Wow who didn’t see this coming
Congrats Chris!
Spot on American accent 🤣❤️
Okay Chris what is Charlotte's drinks because I just realised she is 36... how..... she looks 22.
Go Canada go! Canadians are very liberal by the way. French Canadian females are great.
very happy, more girls in your videos and less girly complaining vacuous baritone
great story Chris! nice you can gradually touch cats too
Big wiredchamp on you because you actually not gay :(
hell yes, always shipped them
2 years of sexual tension! Will they won't they? Yay, awwww. Check out the movie: Popstar Never Stop Stopping ("I'm not gay")
I’ve always thought that Chris and Sharla were a great match. They just got along so well. So happy for them both!
I just lost 5 bucks...  ;p
Connor is left, I can see him dating Kaho.
I had a pretty bad allergy for cats, I had immediate skin reaction after touching one. Then somehow I had a bunch of cats. For a few years. And my cat allergy is pretty much gone. I was tested by a very skeptical doctor who said that's impossible but the test said the same. So yeah it happens.
Whats gonna happen to all the Chris - Connor fanfic I've been writing for so long? 😭 I need to modify my book now.
Congrats and all but please what’s that outro song? 🔥
You know, I could tell from just seeing how you two interacted around each other ;b More from you.  Hope you two get to share the rest of your life and grow together and stay strongly bonded together 💚
finally!!! 👍
Here's to Chris for being a champion of the personal anti-gay lifestyle 🙌🔥
Knew it.
When WWIII hits full tilt, where will you live?
CHRIS, BE GOOD TO HER....SHE'S A NICE GIRL....don't be tooo cheeky!
Hopefully, soon we will see Sharla Abroad! 😀
Wait, are you dating Dave or Roger?
You're always awkward so no problem there.
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT
can you imagine how good their kids are gonna look
just wait until he realizes how far apart vancouver and montreal are.
its so funny the only reason I thought you where gay is because of your videos with Sharmeleon, i thought you looked awkward arround her, hahahahahaha
"seven years ago" he said, meanhile the oldes video from sharlas chanel where he pops up in is from 9 years ago XD
That’s awesome so happy for you two!
thats great, I've been shipping them for years. _even when she was married_
Jeeze im not even a regular viewer and i knew this was going on lol
Poor, poor Connor...
So happy for you man.
Fan Meet & Greet in Montreal? 😄
Congrats she is a great match for you! I am looking forward to meeting both of you two in person when I come back to japan next year! PS - Canada sucks these days. Don't come Don't  do anything. I am from Vancouver! Also don't put the arrive can app on your phone. The current communist government is tracking you. Our PM orders the Police to Trample over the elderly with horses. I miss Japan. Freedom in the land of the Rising Sun!
To Charlotte and Chris, best wishes. Sign of the times you need to explain to people 🥹 Chris as another brit with no crane game. Its nice to see you punch above your weight. Charlotte do feel free to make Chris cosplay as the baron Humbert when you guys go to the ghibli museum for a video 😈
My wife and I met at 15 (we’re 30 now) through mutual friends - she was in a school on one side of town, I was in the other. Then she joined our school for A-Levels because her school’s Sixth Form was shite. We were close friends then but nothing really happened at that time. We both went our separate ways for uni; she moved to Cornwall, I stayed in Wales…but we always kept in touch.   Then a school reunion happened. She couldn’t attend because she had tonsillitis but said she was sad that we couldn’t catch up. Fortunately, my best friend was in the Navy in Cornwall and I was already going down to see him a few weeks later. So I arranged to meet up with her while I was down there and then I just sort of stuck around for a while since I’m a pre-pandemic remote worker! We’ve been inseparable ever since…apart from when I’m on my hundred and something-th play-through of Skyrim…  The point is that we never once had to put up with any of the “getting to know each other” bullshit. We always loved each other’s company and knew each other’s flaws inside-out. Chris’ advice is solid: DATE A FRIEND.
"Why am I dating a Canadian?" "Connor does not shower, also I'm not gay. Besides that, her cats don't activate my allergies and my family lives in Canada" 🤣
To be honest, that's your private life. Everyone should shut up. None of their business, neither is mine.
GJ Chris!
I called this one 2 YEARS AGO!!!!  Finally!!! You guys look great together. Congrats!
Chris, The reason you aren't allergic to those cats is that they are long-haired cold-weather breeds.  They have different proteins in their dander, so unfortunately you are probably still allergic to short-haired cats.
great channel Chris.....but you are making an error.
If you mention that you're not gay so often, then you're 100% gay for sure.
Wow
It's probably because of the breed of the cats
My mum was badly allergic to cats. Until we had cat. Cat won.
Why have only one best man? You can have as mny a you want, there are no rules 🥰
happy for you !!!
Great to know you have a Montreal connection.
Sharla does deserve a nice man and that is Chris-San
Congratulation you both (i would if you wouldnt (if i where in your age, again):)
Congratulations to you both…
Chris dating? I always thought you were a cynical brit.. ;D just kidding I'm happy for ya!
Reasons Chris wouldn’t date Conor:  1. He doesn’t shower  2. Chris isn’t gay  But mainly reason #1.
The only reason they are saying thank god is because the rest of the j vlogging community are afraid chris might actually end up dating natsuki or
Congratz to you two! I am so glad for you! :D
who didnt see this coming......
ah bless chris, ive been watching his videos for a while, great content
だめだね だめよ だめなのよ あんたが 好きで好きすぎて どれだけ 強いお酒でも 歪まない思い出が 馬鹿みたい
Well congrats. I hope you can keep a secret the numerous Japanese baby mamas you racked up over the course of your wild 20s, young man.
I am so happy for you, but I think you've de sensitized yourself to the cat allergie
I always thought you were. Thought it was obvious for a while m that you two were pretty good together.
I heard it first from Sharla. Super exciting. I have been following you two for a quite a while and kept wondering why you guys are not dating when you have such great chemistry. Best wishes to you two!! 💞
What?! Wtf??? He’s not gay???
Congratulations to you both, Also since you and Sharla are dating maybe her appearance fee will be dropped or cheaper ? lol, but on a serious note, again congratulations.
I can just imagine Connor doing a video from working the coat room being a miserable f@cker the entire time. lol
well you can be nice to her dude, like buy her a freakin pair of glasses to see how big a mistake she made, eh? you know what they say here? If you can't get a girlfriend find a Canadian.
Honestly the fact that you would even share that your dating is awsome but I hope you do t feel pressured or get pressured to reveal all aspects of your relationship like some people do
finally!  HOOO-FREAKING-RAY!!!
Step 1. Talk to a female to attempt to make a new friend 😭
I KNEW IT AAAAAAAHHHH
wait is it not a joke? is this true? can someone pls confirm :33
Congrats Chris!
A true bisexual man? Truly interesting!
I had a hunch about you two when Sharla moved to Sendai - and given the chemistry between you. I'm happy I was right. Wish both of you all the best! :)
If it goes well, and i absolutely hope it does, and you get married... That would make it literally a Broad in Japan! Love it. Hope you're doing well and find happiness and love! <3
Really great news 👍 all the best for you both. I felt it and had a hunch that it would eventually lead to that cos of your vids together. There was a spark and chemistry. Congratulations!
Happy for you Chris, congrats!
That's quite impressive! I always thought Chris and Risotto (by the way if you ever call him that in person he'll probably spit in your face) were lovers...  You fooled everybody, Chris! Congrats!
I thought you were dating Sharla when you both just happened to be in the UK at the same time.
Was not expecting this but so happy for them.
“10 out of 10 IGN”  Oh boy, given IGN’s reputation. This is gonna fail spectacularly and create absolute PR nightmare.
Check out Lenard and Penny on The Big Bang Theory, they started out as friends, then friends with benefits, then married but still friends.
Because she’s cute
I actually suspected this for a long time.  Wouldn't have guessed you're gay, not sure where people got that from.
That "date a friend" thing, good advice, really resonated with me. Quick question, do they have to be my friend, or would anyones friend do?
Chris must have felt the attraction in previous years deep down, but Sharla was always with her ex for all those years. ^_^
Those jump cuts are pretty severe. Congrats on your momentary happiness
I think ppl wondering about a relationship with Conner since once Chris said "my boyfriend Conner" in a video, but meaning as a good friend, not a boyfriend kind of relationship.  However, things was kinda suspicious between Chris and Sharla since the first "Journey across Japan" and that video with the mosquitoes at the beginning of a bridge, recording an intro. Congrats Sharla and Chris!!
This is great news! Im happy for the both of you!
We will know when it gets serious when Chris gets his own cat😏
I thought it was a joke, good for you
Congrats Chris... an for what it's worth.. I never once thought you were gay.
3:23 allergic to most pussies, but not Sharla's
9:07 “Apples innit…”  Thank you Chris
not gay. flashing hairband.
Oh the euphoria. 😂
Congrats Chris 👏 👏
WHO ELSE CALLED IT!?
The way the trash taste guys cheered at the news at the start made me think of when your parental figure or that cool aunt/uncle finally got together with a that person they've been hanging around a looooot.
Does Conner use the Hippie bathing philosophy of using a Crystal to keep clean? 😆🤭
Your friends reaction was classic.
I think you make jokes when you get uncomfortable.
FINALLY!! Since I saw the two of you years ago, I had a feeling you two were very compatible! 😁 I’m super stoked for you two! 😄
Awesome dude, good on you guys.
Congrats!
as a canadian I must say.... of course it's 10/10 we're awesome! Happy for you
Chris's Pete impression is on point! Lol
Awk that's great guys. Sorry I missed this...been a lot going on! Totally called it but glad you guys are working out. Hopefully be over in October. All the best
I’m genuinely glad you guys got together, It wasn’t hard to see coming
I wanna be like the candy man when I grow up!
That will totally ruin your cynicism... and what will be left of you then? Silver lining... if it breaks your heart you might come back stronger than ever :) ..
Oh my GOD!!!! I have been watching both of you guys since 2012 and always felt you guys had such a good chemistry. Genuinely glad you guys are together. Hope this works out coz i am sure many felt the same that you'd make a great couple.
Two of my utmost favorite Youtubers!  This is EPIC!
Good luck, Chris.
You 2 always had great chemistry, I'm so proud 😍
I'm so happy for you both. Thank god its not Connor, you're safe from the vtuber backlash
I cannot contain,do you mind the age?
Clean cat is hypoallergenic cat! Or Siberian cat!!!  Small Wood hits!!  Yoo!
Take care of that smart lady! She gave me a way again in Japan!!🤩 ✨✨🌸🌸
Good for both of yous. Always thought you guys suited each other in the videos you created(good chemistry).
I always thought something transpired between these two during Journey Across Japan (2018).
Yeah baby! this is what i’ve been waiting for, this is what it’s all about! Wooaah!
I guess what Archie Bunker said about England isn't true then...
👍
It hurts when you're girlfriend goes to help family in Ukraine and was murdered
I ve been waiting for so long, congratulations Chris
Oh Chris, dating a woman is a truly affable move. Though we know your true romantic feelings towards connerdawg voice acting. Splendid performance my good sir
Lovely 😊
thank you pandemic
Poutine !
Gonna give ya a life hack I learned at 22. If you hate putting effort into Halloween outfits, just dress normal and when anyone asks what you are, say you're dressed as a Jehova Witness. Gets a giggle from them and is Uber effective
Congrats 🥳
Holy shit. I haven't been watching YouTube for a while due to how busy I've been with life. Got into a relationship and now getting married. I had just a bit of time tonight and I wanted to she how the channel was doing. Apparently amazing! Congrats man!
I knew it!!!!
I'm so glad Chris has a Canadian girlfriend (who definitely exists, by the way).
Congratulations
I knew it. 😏.I thought she was American though. Either way I hope all goes well ☺️☺️. Happy for u both.
these meta-LIVE ABROAD REACTION videos are always magic
Chris i love your videos, but it was kinda obvious you 2 clicked on camera. Congrats to u both but i kinda saw it coming
Ehhh... Banff is a tourist trap, just be aware of that. There is some nice sights to see, but.. bring a wallet or dont buy anything. PS, the big hotel is haunted, and the hot springs are pretty nice.
'i wouldnt date conor he doesnt shower' 'also im not gay' priorities
Not gonna lie, kinda jealous but really happy for you both
I mean, why wouldn’t you?
Would love to meet you if you ever come to Banff.  I'm in Calgary which is where you will have to fly to to go to Banff and Moraine Lake :D
Hope Sharla and you stay together forever, love you guys!!!
Ahh cosying up to the colones. Might you be in a Empire building mood Mr UK.
Please bring back the livestream vids😭😭
Ryotaro looks like a variant of Mace Windu.
I don't see why it needs to change anything. Its not like when non youtubers start dating they merge their work places together. However, great opportunity to cover things couples can do in Japan
Congratulations! good luck and enjoy :)
When I date someone, I don't feel the need to announce it on YouTube.  Maybe I'm weird.
どちらも好きなYouTuberなので嬉しいです😉
Love you guys, take good care of each other
it took 4 years?! Just seen your bikeride in 2018. jesus wept lad how slow off the mark are you! PS Top cuts of beef are way healthier than packaged fruit or vegetables, dummy!
Wait, Chris is smiling ... ... ... ...  You ok man?? 😮😮😮😮😮😮
Hey Chris, I'd love to see you do a collab with one of the OG "westerner in Japan" youtuber, Ericsurf6! I'm sure it would be an interesting video. I'd love to see you interview him. He's had a pretty interesting life as a youtuber in Japan.
Congrats bro. She's a great catch.
Banff is great but you want to go to Jasper!  I'm definitely biased because I'm from there but not  Nearly as commercialized , and just as beautiful if not more so!.
Chris abroad in women.
Maaaan, that Pete impression was spot on.
I love it that you both took the time to build your relationship first together.   Best wishes to you both!
You don't remember the exact moment? She probably seduced you then. She probably had a strategy like, give you fried chicken, progressively give you better fried chicken, then smother herself in chicken breadcrumbs and boom! checkmate! She has you. And all you think is "mmmm chicken... this isn't Chicken! It's Sharmelon! How did this happen?! mmm she tastes like chicken!...ummm I guess we're dating now!"  Wait, she made you Chocolate didn't she? I guess we should have figured it out then.
Now you can have all the nato you never wanted lol. Best wishes you both seem like nice people.
Yes allergies can come and go, i never had a cat allergy, found out many years later that i developed one🤷🏻‍♀️ hope it goes away since i adore them
Finally I have been waiting on this for years.
Ngl it seems like you two have dated for a long time, you always had a great vibe together. Glad you two are happy you fit perfectly!
this man is a sage
I'm happy for you both 😊💖💙 look after her  she is very precious. 😀😍💖💙🎎🗼⛩️XXXXX
Buzzing for the pair of you, you both seem like nice people! :)
Your impersonation of Pete is pretty damn good 🤣
So happy for you two! ❤
I knew it! I knew it ever since the first time I saw them in a video together. Called it! Youtube's new power couple...
OMG!! So many judgy people. Also the cat allergy is due to the dander and the more your around slowly builds the tolarance Chris but take some allergy medicine to try to help further I am happy for you both!
Oh my! That’s so sweet. ☺️ Much happiness for you both. ❤️ It’s always a tad awkward to share personal and private info like this isn’t it? 😅 You did fine, worry not. 😊
My cheeks hurt from smiling so much, this makes me so happy 😭
Hey, she wouldn't have acknowledged it if she didn't think it was going to last. Best of luck, Chris!
Congratulations!
Congrats! i always loved you two being together
Super excited for you guys! I knew deep down you guys are perfect for each other.
Well , that solves that. Chris is a lesbian.
On sharmeleon “ A day at Yamadera Mountain Temple with @Abroad in Japan 12:44 you said your boyfriend Cdawgda
F Connor
To be fair Chris, "I have a cat allergy" is code for gay, ie I don't like pus...  Plus that headband isn't screaming "I'm a heterosexual" either.
His words say straight, his tone says denial and the neon glasses being used as a hairband screams for Conner's loving touch.
i'm stunned you guys weren't dating for the first journey across japan.  that one episode where you two bike over that huge-ass bridge together had me convinced you were dating and just being private about it.   the connection was strong and obvious.    anyways, good for you both.  congratulations, and i look forward to "a broad melon" content.
I knew it! Since a long time ago
love it..best whishes for you guys!
Damn, I’m surprised because Sharla seems like such a sweet person.
Why would you date a canadian😡
When the F-15 Jets flew over your heads together, was when I thought "These 2 finish each others sentences."
Many of us have waited years for this announcement! Glad you two finally realized what must happen. :)
Are you drunk?
Candyman costume big brain approves
In the words of Jules Winfield (Samuel l Jackson) in pulp fiction “My girlfriends a vegetarian which pretty much means I am too!”
Love how people shipped Chris and Conner like like they were Tweek and Craig.
I ship it! 🚢
So happy for you guys 💘
He’s so dating Connor
No surprise there and also we don’t f@$& care who you date, it’s not our business . Move on move on! ❤️congrats 🎉
I moved from the UK to Canada. And I'll tell you, the "friendly Canadian" thing is a myth.   Everyone here only looks out for themselves, no one holds doors open, people walk through queues, shout at you if you are in their way for a second, talk to you nastily, are quite racist and the "pick up truck driving Trump loving Freedumb convoy" morons are more prominent than you think they are.    I'm glad my Canadian wife isn't like them  (Ontario)  People who say sorry a lot are the British, not Canadians. (no evidence so far, 5 years here and I miss the UK a lot)  Oh and fast food chains everywhere! No good food. Just fries with everything!
Why would you date canadian in Japan :D :D
Poor Conor, first you slip it into him, then you get a beard to cover it.... So sad.... no more meat eating videos i guess...
This explains why your right arm has lost muscle mass.
Loving the outro music, Chris!!
Very happy for the both of you!  As a person with a terrible cat allergy, I wish you the best of luck.  Also thank you for blessing us at 3:57 with your long - vanished Chad-voice.  Ruddy 'el, mate, that was not expected.  Hey... as part of the Too Much Volcano group, that makes Sharla Yoko, doesn't it?  Lol <3
Sorry chris but 99% of this comments are just like me they are jokes. I have called you fitlhy peasant when connor is well mannered aristocrat and thats true but some others are not.
Honestly I thought he was dicking down chiaki. Either way it's a win. Both girls are gorgeous. Good luck on all future endeavors.
'10 out of 10, would date again' 🤣🤣... That's Shakespeare isn't it?  Awesome news guys, happy for you both.
A blind person can see you both have a crazy chemistry
In couple of months she will swear off men forever because of you, but don't worry your marriage to CDawgVA will last forever.
Congratulations Chris!!!!!!
I thought it was pretty clear for awhile that you two were dating.  Nice that you finally confirmed it.
Heeeeyy, congratulations! Wishing you guys lots of happiness and adventure!
That Pete impression is spot on Chris
.... because all the japanese girls tell ya dame ?
It will be nice to feel comfortable acting like a couple in public rather than awkwardly trying to hide it. Makes for better content!
Nice try Connor. Forcing Chris to make this video hasn't fooled us. Very clever.
Looks like I gotta start at step 1 to get a healthy relationship.. Get a friend.
This is my new favorite video. It used to be a draw between the 1969 moon landing, the 1888 first video ever recorded, and martin luther king jr's "I Have A Dream" speech. But fk all of those LOL
Chris: "Date a friend."  I've been dating mine for eleven years, and we got engaged five years ago (I proposed with a PS4 lmao). We are still going strong 💜
What kind of cat step-father ranks his children
Were you 2 dating when you did the cycle vids!?!? FINALLY
I just found your channel somehow after it popped up. Basically I started listening to your story of dating your Canadian friend and it fascinated me. Also, have been to Japan many times and am basically Japanese now. Glad I found your channel and thank you.
Congratulations to you both! 😀Wish you the best!
Grats on the very great catch. ;)
IIIIIIIIII LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEE YOOOOOOUUUUUUU GUUUUUUUYYYYYSS SOOOO MUUUUCCHHHHHHH<33333333333333
omg Chris I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!
Dude, knew you guys had some chemistry going on when you were both in the first travel special all that time ago.
Im happy for u guys :)
Congratulations
She's beautiful, sucks when they break your heart though:(
Might be a bit late to the party here...but about dating a friend...  I befriended a girl in middle school...I was a week short of turning 12, having just skipped a grade, she was 15.  She didn't really like me too much at first, but we did become friends...I asked her out in high school (I was 14, 2 years from graduating; she was 17 and 1 year from graduating), but she turned me down then, as she had a boyfriend at the time.  Several years later, we started hanging out a bit, she ended up getting a job where I worked, and we started going together.  That was 16 years ago...and we're still together to this day (for time reference...I'll be 37 here in a month or so).  Congratulations and best of luck to you and Sharla, Chris...you two honestly seem like great people who complement each other well :) .
Can’t wait to see more crossover videos, Sharla is amazing, congrats to you both!
You’ve been friends so long and got along so well I thought you’d end up together
It's about time I could tell she always liked you and wondered why you guys never got together. Happy to see it love both your channels
Y'all probably don't want to hear this, but to American women (with our somewhat thuggish men) all y'all European guys appear at least slightly gay to us.
Not to be offensive, but We're all glad that you're dating anyone.
Chris wants that free health care 😁
is this stream also unlisted? anyone got a link?
each cat has a different bacteria and you can get used to specific cats
well, im canadian and its not a benefit here in quebec. half of the people i know speak french only and i find being québecois a bad thing. no nightlife here, macdonald closes at midnight. tim horton closes at 10 pm. no nightlife at all except in Montréal. but Chris. you got a beautiful girl there. take care of her and cherrish her. Have a good day( Frank from Trois-Rivières )
Happy for you and Sharla 💕👍 I watched her video where she said it publicly, even though most of us knew it somehow 😉 Best relationships are the ones that started as a friendship, talking from my own experience 🤗 Enjoy life 🧬❤️ Mr.Candy 😂
next on Dr Oz : Love cure cats allergy
Are we going to see a triple date with Felix+Marzia, Chris+Sharla and Connor+Kaho?
Been following since your early founding ( maybe floundering) days. Great to see how your life as developed in Japan. Well done young man.
Isn't Connor dating Shibuya Kaho in secret anyway?
you could kinda tell when you were making videos, the smile she gives, the joy in your eyes. It's just nice that it's been a silent confirmation from my side. Happy for you both, you keep doing you ❤
all those solo hotel trips with Connor helped the gay allegations propagate
Important question: Did you actually take a drink from that can of 9% plum drink during the making of this highly emotionally charged video?
Good for you! Your respite from allergies is cat-specific. You will lose an allergy to anycat you spend a lot of time with.
the chemistry was kind of exploding every time you were together so yeah I'm not surprised lol (and trust me, i don't like shipping real life people) but it was about as obvious as the Rock starring in an all Rock remake of Rocky.
A. bit of warning. I have cats and cat allergies and I'm fine 90% of the time. but every now and then i get an ATTACK FROM HELL. Keep an over the counter allergy pill handy for those. B. Congrats. A toast to continued happiness.
Dude, +5K comments, probably you'll never see this, but you're looking younger and in good shape, so whatever that is, keep it going!
Your allergy to cats gets better with exposure to cats. I was really allergic to cat then I was in the situation you are in and now I live with two cats with very little issue. Except if I pet the cat then rub my eye. Instant red eye.
Conner should be your Bridesmade
Glad to hear it about you guys!  The onscreen chemistry between you two was pretty obvious.     A word of advice you don't need or want,  after 17 years with my wife,  its not a 50/50, its 100/100 from both of you.    Best of luck!
Marry already, those babies would be so cute!😍
I wish you and Sharla the best!!!
Really fantastic news. You guys have always been a joy to watch when you've shared videos and adventures. All the best!
I’m sorry Chris. I thought you were gay too.  🫢
When I first got my cat, my eyes started tearing up and burning.  Overtime I  no longer had a reaction
Cat allergiesare  be based on different species. Some are worse and sum are less
See, I don't understand this. I'm not a subscriber, so maybe I just don't understand your concept. But why would you stuff your romantic relationship into this here channel, which I assume is a business for you? Or why would you stuff your business into that relationship? Are you trying to create a reality show? You don't think a relationship is challenging enough in and of itself? This is just so strange to me. Good luck!
I bet 3 yen that he was gay. Bollocks.
Is Ryotaro invited to the wedding?
Make a sequel to Cat Nation!
Congratulations Chris! I've been watching both of the channels for a few years. I'm glad to see you two been together :)
wHAT THE HELL, this set??? It's so awesome!
Chris isn't gay, he's English ;)
why does chris' face become elon musk when he speaks with an american accent?
How did we not see this earlier. Sharla "in japan", Abroad "in japan". They already share a last name!
First white guy to go to japan and not date a japanaese girl lol
You can definitely pick up and lose allergies over time. Like people who have happily been smashing down shrimp every day can one day have an allergic reaction to it later in life and then have it from then on. Human body be whack yo.
I knew this guy fu**ed. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Long haired cats are actually more hypoallergenic than short hair too, they shed less so that must've helped the easing into being around them more!
I figured. Awesome Chris 👍
I am so happy for the both of you! I've watched both channels for years and so glad you two are two together. Wishing both of you the best!
I fucking knew it 🥳
Wa hoo, you'll be listening to Justin Bieber next... Does anyone know where to get one of those cool visors Chris has on his head?
Yo happy for u Chris :)
Maaaaaany happy returns to you both!
Congratulations to you and Sharla.
What’s the big deal?! I thought you guys were dating long time ago.
This is brilliant ❤️
Saw this coming from the bike across Japan series . Congrats to you both.
We did it bois.
Chris you’re looking good! The meat cutting is clearly working :)
Please don't let this turn into =3 with Ray William Johnson when his girlfriend started showing up in the videos and it wasn't funny anymore. So sad.
At the end of the day it doesn’t really matter. It goes without saying really. It hasn’t mattered before this came out and it shouldn’t suddenly matter now. Best wishes to Chris and Sharla though.   Rip Connor.
It’s not the cats people are allergic to but the cat saliva. Cats groom themselves by licking their fur and it’s the saliva which people can be allergic to.
Ahh so happy for you both - even though I don't know you and never will, and you don't know me or care about me, but, all that being said, I'm still happy for you. What a strange world we live in.
It's good to know you're in a happier place Chris. Keep at the diet and exercise and prove that Trash Taste fan art wrong!
Fucking knew it from first video
I've been saying this for years. This is not something new.
I'm so happy about this, I hope that the relationship flourishes and lasts for a really really long time, you guys seem like a great match and I'm so happy for you, hope we can see you guys together more :)..
Following you both on YouTube for the longest time and SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH!  Sharla is from British Columbia, Canada!  Chris you are a very lucky man!
You don't have to explain!! It's your business! Happy for you both though 😊
Chris isn't gay, he's British
I had some suspicions when Shar moved to Sendai. Really happy for you both 😄
lol I thought you and Connor were dating.
You’re British, so you don’t need any visas for Canada!
Normally I'm not one to care about YT drama/real life stuff, but the title baited me hard, well done.
The difference in your skin tone between shots is kinda wild
Now that we have the best man established, I think  Pete Donaldson should officiate the wedding :)
Omg what fever dream is this!!???
I told the wife months (maybe years?) ago "Chris should go out with Sharla, they would make a good couple", and here it is validated.  Congratulations,  I hope you have many happy years together.
"I wouldn't want to date the guy he doesn't shower " connor can never recover from the truth. Also cat allergies seem up and down I'm horribly allergic to cats but we have 5 in the house i live in but my allergies haven't been as bad since we got more strangely.
The first time I saw u guys in a video,,, I knew I guys will be together,,, don’t know why 🤷🏻‍♀️
It’s been obvious you can see her recording for him all the time.
Good for both you!
When you are in love....cat allergies go away.
I hope it goes so well she becomes Mrs. Abroad.
Very simple , Proximity . It’s the cause of most sexual relationships .. look it up , human nature is fascinating .
So happy for you both! When I saw your video in your then new ramen bar set I thought hmmm, they’d make a cute couple and then ta da 🎉 You look good too Chris, your buttons on that blue shirt wouldn’t be as tight as they were before 😆Keep up the great work 👏👍🥰
I once had a guy think I was gay too because I didn't want to have sex with him. No I am not, it's only because he was fat and ugly.
congrats!
Oh noes connor got dumped! xd  srsly, congratz tho! <3  but yes, my step mom also had super bad allergy. And then a doc recommended to get along hair cat. She did, (Snowball <3 pure white long hair cat). She had him for his life time and now it 99% gone!
Jesus loves you all
Great idea to date a friend. I've been dating my best friend since 1995.
"Why I'm dating a Canadian",  Every guy knows the real answer,  Because she let you.
I follow Sharla. She is awesome, just like you. Get your shit together and don't drink when you are stressed Chris. <3
AWWWW so happy for you two!!!! sincerely, from a random stranger on the internet who watches you guys religiously
I been following you guys for years and I'm really happy for you!
Been So obvious ❤️
Ahh  so happy for you :D
I KNEW IT. You guys look good together. Your energy is right for each other. Congratulations guysss yayyyy 🎉🎉🎉
Good move, man! Be happy!!
You guys had great chemistry together, so it is nice that you are actually dating. You always make Sharla laugh and she softens your British edge
good on you she is a real catch.
I'm allergic to cats and I have two cats and my allergy has not gone away, however, I find if I bath my cats every few weeks to get the saliva off their hair my allergies aren't too bad.
I hope you guys are happy together :3
"i'm not gay" - chris broad 2022
shit I guess I need to find some friends
You know those are your real bros when they are *that* invested in ur dating life 😂😂 Happy for you Chris, both of u ☺️
Does anyone know if like Chris and Garnt are enemies? Like are they distinctly not fond of eachother?
Abroad in Canada
Good luck to you and Roger David! I'm sure you make a great couple.
I knew it, I said to my friend, "I really think these two Japan youtubers would make a good couple," and I like being right haha
I'm not sure why I never knew she was from BC. Most of the Canadian influencers/content creators I know of are from Alberta or Manitoba so I just assumed she was from there too :P Anyway, congratulations!
Sorry Chris, I didn't hear a thing you said. I was too disorientated by your Japanese techno hairband.
So nice that you’re eating more veggie and enjoying the kitty company. I follow Sharla’s channel, she is so lovely! Hope you two stay happy and healthy.
The trash can guys cheering for Chris is peak “We’re gonna make it bros” energy
Well, so much fòr being able to share your videos. Too bad people find it comfoŕtable to ise curse words. Bye.
Congratulations to both of you. You guys really make a great couple.
Cos that’s all anyone needs is a cockblocking cat 🐈 due to allergens 🙄😂
Known it for a long time. Was not a surprise but so happy for them!!! Wishing a long and healthy relationship!!
I know when it’s the marriage bond stage…… the slim moustache will go. The best to you both….. stay away from the French.
I've always wondered to be honest. About bloody time :) Congrats. Dating Conner? What are people on?
You going to buy post-it’s for Sharla, too? :p
Did you lose a bet?
I know that what people think is irrelevant, but I feel happy for you both
My opinion on this is, just keep it as private as possible. The internet doesn't need to know everything! I wish the best to both of you! :)
Congratulations 🎉
That's really nice.  You're both good and kind people, so I'm so happy for you both. <3  Also, if you're still looking to move to Canada, I'd say to wait until Covid goes (if it ever will).  Some people here are still very aggressive about the idea of "masking up" and there's a lot of ignorant messaging (flags, bumper stickers)...
Elated. Truly. I was sure.
Congratulations to you both! Lovely couple. 😍
Congrats, amigo! Not sure the nationality matters (and I’m Canadian), but it matters you’re both happy. :)
I thought everyone already knew you were dating. It was insanely obvious starting from when she went on the bike trip with you.
Glad for you :) Have fun and take care o/
aBEARD in Japan amirite?
will she be in the new journey across Japan? 👉👈
Congrats to both of you, Cheers!!  ;)
I picked up a vibe between you guys a few months back and wondered??? Can’t believe I was right.  Congratulations!  You guys make a sweet couple ❤️
It’s convenient that you both already have the same last name.
Holy sh..! I've been hoping for this since your first collaboration! You've always had such a cute vibe in my eyes. I'm soo happy for both of you ❤️😊
Over a year ago i commented on a video, “Chris I think she’s the one” 😱
"I'd never want to date Connor"   Rip Connor 🤣
I suspected this from one of your earlier videos from way back, there was obvious chemistry between you two
I don’t know who these people are, but for clarification you are not dating anyone mate she is dating you, if you know the difference
We're happy for you and Sharla. If it doesn't work out, we'll like you the same. If it does, we'll be happy for you both.
Saw this from 14000miles away
Friends being this supportive of a relationship is so sweet 🥺🥺 when I told my friends that the guy I liked liked me back they all cheered for me and now I am marrying that guy this October :3
Dude I’ve been suss on you two for the longest time haha , me n the missus said it over n over watching your stuff , congrats man you two are pretty damned cute looking together
Just wash your hands after you pet the cat it'll help reduce the allergy. Also do not touch anywhere near your eyes after you pet the cat.
Really don't care who you date really don't care much about how you live your life... really just watch so I can see you and your buds go across Toyko seeing things that most would never normally film... gotta say the fact that you are planning on bringing her into the video's sadden me ... I am not a huge fan of the way more ladies act on camera being a older woman myself and lot of experience around many people, the way they act on camera annoys me (not to say all do have many ladies I watch and have for yrs) ... I liked the way your little band of buds got along and interacted when going out and about to explore... I am sure your channel will grow massively and you will have great leaps and bounds forward but this is the end for me... was amazing watching you but really not in the mood for girly chatters and giggles... thanks for many hrs of entertainment :)
I guess you GAY-ve off those vibes xD Honestly amazing and hilarious! Best news of recent times.
It was dead obvious mate.
And btw u don’t have to b gay to be susssssssss to ur homies man 😑🤣
Conner is too good for the world🥲
"...it wasn't a problem with Sharla's cat..."  Ahmm...ahh...
Thank you god! 😂
You seem happy 👏
Weebs really do make good friends. 😂  Anyway, just stay the same guys…if there will be changes in the future hopefully it’s going to be constant improvement to the content you guys pump out.
Thank you, God!
As odd as it sounds, I’ve always thought Chris was very similar to my dad. They’re both grumpy English men that love food a bit too much. And now that I know Chris and Sharla are dating, I actually see a lot of similarities between Sharla and my mum personality wise. So I think Chris and Sharla are sure to make a great couple and have a happy relationship. Hopefully I didn’t just jinx it.
it's kinda funny coz i feel both fanbases have been shipping you both for years haha
Because a Canadian slightly gets the British sense of humour more than a Japanese girl who won’t get it at all!!
I think you can build up immunity to certain cats because the same thing happened to a friend of mine.  He’s allergic to cats but after a few months he was suddenly not allergic to my cat.
Yaaassss knew it, congrats guys!!!!!!
In all honesty... I thought sharla was married years before Taylor. I am so sorry... Idk why but i genuinely thought she was married. Also.. I dont really watch her videos so... I dont really know her life like her fans
I saw this coming from ages ago!
It doesn't matter... most relationships don't work so enjoy it while it last and don't make a big deal about it.  The Internet will get annoying if they get attached...
cycle across japan the sequel! do it!
Chris's impression of Pete is spot on LOL. XD
Take a shower  Connor
"jasonk8985 Have you ever seen Sharla and Connor in the same room? Connor has been known to cosplay after all." "Nott Joey "Chris" "dating" a girl is perfect because it pushes away from the rumors of Mouse being Chris as well, the perfect alibi for Chris actually being Mouse! " -It is all coming together! #hiddenagenda
Congratulations!  Don’t “F” it up.
When I saw your videos together I knew something had to be going on. Both of you are too chill af to not kick it regularly.
That's so awesome! I'm excited about 9% plum drink! I really wanna try it! Oh and also congrats on the relationship. Cheers 😆
Cheers!
Because Canadians are just that awesome.
Connor is already in a relationship anyway isnt he?
Y’all are public figures thanks to YouTube, but y’all deserve to have parts of your lives private as well. I always thought you two would be cute together.
How did he land her
Am happy for you Chris :)
WHERE CAN I GET THE HEADBAND
ACTTUALLY??
Shouldn't Connor be sad?... Just joking, I'm happy to hear the you're one a wholesome relationship, be nice with her, bevause it'll make the relationship last longer :3
My wife and I dated for a year and this August 4th, we celebrated 32 years together.
Chris, im nobody. Insignificant in life. Non-you tuber which lowers my supposed status. . This was seen a while  ago and honestly not a suprise. After the Journey Across Japan you could have guessed it.  It is a good thing giving your fame. Just be careful. Too many will judge if it goes awry. Also, why the hell did you say "Connor , my boyfriend"? That was a bit silly. Also, why dosent Connor shower. He always looks like an old vagabond wearing the same shirts all the time. Hes damn brilliant but looks like he smells like dirty laundry. I guess thats what happens when your that smart.
Connor doesn't shower 😆eww Connor wtf
Connor lost his boyfriend, and his best friend at the same time. I can't believe Ironmouse would do this.
You been watching a lot Stewart Lee recently, mate!? Good person to rip off for a comedy tone though! Haha
The cat is out of the box (or bag)!  Love the news!  I have been supporting both you and Sharla on Patreon for years now.
Oh my gosh I started watching her in like 2014 and you in like 2019 this is the best crossover episode yet
dude i fucking shipped that shit since before journey across japan. she laughs at you too much lol. good job! xD
About bloody time.
Hope it all falls to bits.  For the American viewers this isn't an insult you continentals
Chris is the luckiest guy ever with the best job and hottest girl. So jelly!
yeah woo this is good :)
FINALLYYYYYYYY 🙌🏻
All the signs are there. Did you think we wouldn’t recognize you? 👀
Sometimes your body can adjust to the allergy and tolerate it. I've lived with cats all my life and didn't think I was allergic. But when I migrated to another country I didn't have a cat for 8 years until finally it was time to get a cat. Lo and behold, my cat almost killed me. Really bad allergic reaction, and I locked myself in a room for days and weeks. But as time went by I started having less and less reaction to the cat. It's been 7 years with the same cat and I'd still get reactions once in a while but very rarely these days.  And my allergy doctor confirmed that I am indeed allergic to cats.  One key thing, give the cats frequent baths.
Congrats!  Happy for you both!
Despite having grown up very allergic to kitties, they are my favorite. Exposure therapy due to years of having many cats now I don't have a reaction unless they poke me or lick me too much. I used to have to consciously wash my hands and any exposed skin after petting or being in contact with a cat (some cats trigger more strongly) or a place they had been or pay with puffy and itchy with runny nostrils. Now I can rub my face on a cat if I so desire... I have tested this XD
I always thought you were dating Emma. Guessed wrong lol. Grats to you and Sharla though mate!
OMG!  I screamed when I heard the news!  I've LITERALLY been shipping you both together since I saw your chemistry on your first Cycling Across Japan special.  😊 I'm happy for you both!   A relationship built on friendship is SO amazing and intimate.  I met my boyfriend in spring 2007.  We didn't get together until December 2010.  ^^  It'll be 12 years when this year ends, and it feels like it all went by in a flash.  I still feel like some youngin when we're together, and I hope you guys do that for each other as well.    All the best and congrats again! 🎉
Just don't get her pregnant, GOD I wouldn't want you turning into a boring father figure😅
Won't lie, I cried when I knew because I was so happy for both of you. But that's on me, was having the worst month of my life and these news were so positive that I cried of joy 😅  Also, I didn't know you knew each other for so long...being friends first sometimes makes the best relationships; you had time to figure each other out as people, sand out the kinks and such against each other and see what works or not together.   Nice to see you less frowny, Chris ✨ love from Argentina, as always!
im really happy for you and sharla chris :)
The boi's reaction was something special.
Nothing wrong with it. She's a great looking lass. Good on ya.
That was a great American accent!
Thanks Chris… always fun to see a new video. Stay honest and be yourself.
Abroad in the Frozen North
I was the one that said yall look like a cute couple in yall first video. So you're welcome 🙏 i planted that seed 🤲
Did he just say "I'm not gay, not that there's anything wrong with that"?
So glad ironmouse found a nice Canadian girl. 💕
I've been waxing lyrical about AbroadinJapan to my sister and my niece (who has recently got into all things Japanese).  My sister asked "is it family friendly" and I said "Of course!" (my niece is 13).  Now I've suddenly realised how many F Bombs are dropped 😂.
I love the idea of you two together and the possibility of getting to run into you in Victoria!
do NOT date a friend because if it goes south, you lose not only your significant other, but also the friendship
Congratulations Chris!
I’m glad to hear that you’re not allergic to Sharla’s cats.
Saw that coming after that one bicycle trip in JAJ season 1 where he hit the pole while @Sharmeleon was right behind him!
Glad to know you aren't gay.
very happy for this news! you are both adorable!
Why do people still forget being bisexual is a thing....
that cute nervous nose pinch you do xD
I absolutely knew this would happen!  After watching the two of you together and feeling that chemistry, I was waiting for this moment. Congratulations to the both of you, and best wishes for the future!
YES!!! 🤩❤️ This absolutely made my day congrats you two!!! I always thought you two would be great together. Much happiness and many a wonderful adventure to you both! 💕
Holy #### Chris Sharla has like 200k more subs than you !   Get cracking man!
I'm Dutch enough to know that Chris is definitely not gay.         He's just British  I also remember him having a Japanese girlfriend years ago. Regarding being allegedly allergic to cats: chances are that you aren't and that it is entirely a psychological issue. And when you believe something is wrong because of this and that, your body will respond because it is literally make believe.  Anyway, you can take a simple allergy test at the hospital if you want to be sure.
Was dating Japanese women just too much of a cultural divide? Assuming you tried..
Amazing how cool I have been following Sharla and you for so long :D nice couple
Who tf ever thought Chris was gay? No offense mate but xD there was never any ambiguity in the community. Happy for your straight relationship but no, xD no ambiguity.
Lmaooooo *Garnt being all of us getting the news*   *And woo <3 Yay for you two! **Poor Connor :(
WOW I don’t think ANY OF US would of guessed that Chris mate, bloody hell mate even a blind man could of seen it ya daft bugger, congratulation to you both 🤣🤣🤣
Gonna be great to see the many adventures of Mr. and Mrs. inJapan. Cheers!
So glad you and Sharla are dating!  She's awesome!  Also a damn shame you and Conner didnt work out..lol
Well this explains the lack of videos being put out 😂
Love this <333333
Well from watching this channel for 5 years now…. I think no honorable Japanese family would have a foreigner for a son in law.  So I figured you’d have to have a relationship with a non Japanese.
Happy for you both! The world is a better place with more happy people :)
Yee we all shipped you a long time ago.
AYE CONGRATS ON HOOKING UP WOTH SHARLA!! Hope it's a long and healthy relationship!
Appearance fees! At first I thought you BS’ing us, but now I see it. You will be in her vids quite often and she will hardly ever be in yours. Sounds about right (QA you know)🤣🤣🤣
The future glasses weirdly makes for a cute handband.
Youtubers are an incestuous bunch ain’t they?
Yeah, my friend was extremely allergic to dogs, when he would visit on the weekends he couldn’t stand to stay for a day. But after a few months he could stay for days at a time with no problem whatsoever. It was incredibly and neither of us heard of this kind of thing before.
This was inevitable, it was either Sharla or Connor. His heart must be in tatters right now.
Why do people think you're gay? I've got good gaydar (worked in interior design as a custom builder) and you don't seem gay at all.
That feeling when you watch a yt and don't understand the concept. You don't know why this is great news. Sure if you're happy, that's good for you. But I don't understand.   More important to me, now I know Chris is not IronMouse in disguise.
That candy man costume was really good because it gives a fun story
Like we couldn't see it from 100 miles away 😂 It was very clear during your bike journey across Japan. Congratulations
ALL I CAN SAY IS....DOH!
MY MAAAAAN
I'm happy for you both 💛
We've been best friends for 11 years before my wife and I got married. She's Canadian and I'm from Cameroon (in Africa). I believe the best marriages are built upon the solid foundations of great friendships.  Congratulations Chris. This video came out right when I was wondering about your relationships in Japan lol.
That was a perfect Pete impression 👌
I saw this coming, believe me or don't. Congratulations both of ya I'll believe your advice about dating, but I can't really prove it yet, I moved so many times as a kid (don't pity me, just stating a fact), but I can agree with the reverse: dating someone you don't know to well is closer to hit and miss, only it's mostly the miss
Congrats, she's quite a catch, really pleasant and happy girl. Don't get her fat!
So Sharla will be "A broad in Japan"
Sharla is just a cover for Conor it’s so obvious it’s okay Chris   The emphasis of you not being gay just proves that you are we won’t judge you it’s 2022 you don’t need a cover
This changes everything
7:00 Daaaaaaaang!
I knew this would happen eventually. Happy for this.
I KNEW you 2 were dating as soon as I saw you both had content in London at the SAME TIME!!  So happy for you both!
I've been watching you both for YEARS! Every vlog or video I've seen which involved in both of you guys in I've always thought you two would be nicely suited! I really do hope you two both work out 💪🏾 from a big follower from England Coventry! You're doing bits Chris!😂
Congrats...and also, the Kodawari Taste Lemon Sour 9% are better....
Friends first is the best advice ever! I have an eerily similar partner story to you guys, i was friends with my other half for seven years then he left to move to another city and I thought that would be the last time I'd see him but thankfully,  he came back and we have recently celebrated our 12th anniversary 💙 ❤️  all the best to you both!
Maple syrup and fish & chips interesting combo
Poor Pete. Get well soon.
Some allergies in general i think lessen overtime and exposure. I think your body just adapts. My brother also had a pretty bad cat allergy and then all of a sudden we got one any brother was completely fine
Oh wow that's great! It was clear from past videos that there was a vibe there. That's put a smile on my face to finally know for certain lol.
Thinnking about it, this was pretty much bound to happen one day. With Sharla seemingly accepting you as you are, i mean... :D Wish you all the best, though. May the connection hold for a long time.
hahah, I assumed you had been dating all along!
Lmaooo Chris gave off gay vibes Lmaooo
I don't mean to jinx it but your two channels name.... i mean.... WTF
why the fuck am i not surprised i saw this coming biking around japan days ago
I have no clue who are you sir, but I'm glad you have a relationship and it's nice to you so. Cheers!
Before i watch this video, just based off the title, there is no excuse Chris...
I’m so happy for you 🥹✨!!お幸せに！
I don't ever really care about content creators and their relationships. Never strikes me as something I NEED to care about and there's no real interest. Same with sexuality; don't care if they're gay/straight/bi.  Glad stuff's working out for Chris and all the best, but I don't think I'll ever understand the need to pair up creators. It's like the whole "omg, celebrity x is dating celeb y, here's the scoop" nonsense. They're just people. Just let them do their thing; as long as the relationship doesn't suddenly and drastically change the content you've come to enjoy, why should anyone concern themselves with the subject.
Immunotherapy can definitely work in some cases by just constantly exposing yourself to an allergen until your body figures out how to deal with it. This is precisely how allergy shots are intended to work in order to treat immune response. Glad it was able to work out for you and the cats!
The guy who is fluent in Japanese and has been in Japan for years ends up with a Canadian. Same sort of thing for Sharla. Interesting.
5:19 Not much, except it basically turned into Nazi Germany.  Also I knew this was gonna happen eventually ^^
Does anyone know the name of the outro song?
You're lucky enough you didn't get "friendzoned" man... I tried several times wanting to date a friend and it doesn't end up well most of the time 😂😅 lol
Congrats Chris. I could always tell both of you had some sort of special connection.
Been following you both for a few years now on the YouTube. She seems like an amazing person and I am incredibly happy for you both!
prime example for: "gay or just european?"
the fucking pete impression hahahahhaha
Chris: 'I'm not gay.'  It won't stop the shippers, Chris.
AHHHHHHH WHY AM I a 25 year old man screaming happiness from this, that's amazing!!!
I guess I'll have to settle for becoming your SECOND best Canadian friend?
You showing her subscriber count made me check yours and I realized I wasn't actually subscibed to you... How have I been able to consistently watch your videos without subscribing to you...?
You guys are the only YouTubers I’m a patron of because you two have been my favourites for years, even before I knew you guys were friends. Then Sharla posted a pic of you guys on Instagram a few years ago and I was like ‘oh cool, my two favourite YouTubers hanging out’ so you don’t understand how wholesome this is to me to see two people I really respect happy together!😻
Sharla: I am dating  Chris The fellas: he answers prayers
congratulations bro
Happy for you guys. Ever since the Journey Across Japan series, you guys gave off that we're in a relationship vibe.
This is wonderful news, I'm so happy for both of you :-). You've always seemed to enjoy working together on Journey and the other times I've seen you both on camera.
Just me or does he look healthier?
I want to know so much more🥲When is your guys' anniversary?
I thought you dated years ago!!
Dating a Canadian. How absurd😤
Its nice to see you happy chris! I hope you and sharla the best
I've been hoping for this since your first video way back in with her in it!!!
I think people are just being sarcastic about Connor sorry if it bothered you
So glad for you two <3
Heard about this on the podcast first. It's weird and parasocial to care about this, but quite honestly dating is a hellscape at best, and just nice to see two charming, charismatic people get together. Good for you both.
Awww I love this! ❤️
I love you guys I'm glad you're dating. Sharla is cute and a sweetheart and you're really great dude from what you show us. Sounds so stupid I don't know either of you but as someone that watches both your channels I'm really happy for the both of you. I'm also very jealous cuz honestly either of you... hey what's up? 😛😛😛 Get out of here you crazy kids!  Also now I know I'm not crazy cuz I suspected something like this was going to happen ever since you did the journey across Japan the thing I feel like she really enjoyed your company and likewise you enjoyed her company so why not
I love you guys So glad for you 💕
I use to be allergic to cats, went away after some years.
A wise choice, not to go public about it, might jinx it otherwise. :) congratz tho.
I married my best friend and we even got engaged without dating and married 3 months later and this October we will have been married 23 years 💗
Hmmm.. so he's not gay....
Great news wishing you both the best
Great news mate.  Best wishes to you both from  Australia.
Lovely video, sometimes its nice to see something happy going on in the world. Been a fan of the channel for many years and wish you lots of happiness and health going forward (as a fellow brit!).
huh, didnt know she is into chubbsters!
Chris, your understanding of healthy food is wrong. Carbs bad, mmkey. (That includes rice and other grains and fruit and vegetables, in addition to obvious sugar.)
Don't feel like I needed to know that you guys are dating or what the fuss is all about but I'm happy for you.
Congrats Chris! Sharla as well!
yeah i used to be really allergic to cats! but now absolutely fine - also found I was affected less by long haired cats.
hmm the way he's talking sounds almost believable  like its not some insanely elaborate  april fools prank or rick roll...
The Boys being so hype was so good to see. Great Job Chris
Still good to hear it, Hope ya two will be happy for a very long time. You both deserve it
woohoo chris . good on ya . btw ......... there is a difference between being gay , or being sexualy gay ....... as having a "gay old time" 😁
oh no honey i never once thought you were gay. not once. but i know for a fact you would be hot shit in the gay community, so i think its more the dream of you being gay without actually taking into consideration what your actual sexuality is.
Canadians are good, but not so much the country right now. There are good locales to visit, but you're better off staying elsewhere. lol Congrats to you two.
How could a cat lover like Sharla not fall for the legendary host of the No.1 documentary on cats - Cat Nation!
Can we please have an update on Rodger & Dave???
love how he said "he doesn't shower" as the first comment on why he doesn't date connor and the "i am not gay" comes second. 🤣😂🤣
Vancouver Island 🏝🥰 ! I’m also from Victoria!!   I’m incredibly happy for you both💕
I’m glad you got a girlfriend, Chris
Awww good luck and wishing you both many happy memories to make 😀
I was always wondering why you two weren’t dating. You guys are so good together. I am very happy for you.  And on cat allergies: Mine went away as well after living with two cats. It took a while though.
Happy dating. All the best to you both!
Regarding your cat allergies, Im allergic to cats and 2 of the them.  Im fine the majority of the time but when i get tired I can stroke one of them and then touch my eyes (tired) and the the allergy starts.  Also if you get scratched, I get itchy and a welt appears.  Great videos Chris and congrats.
Awesome, carry on loving  in Japan
ワオ〜…なんて素敵なニュース！お二人に永遠の幸あれ！
Yay! was rooting ever since! You both are looking a like. <3
Does Connor know?
i thought something was up  when she instantly knew your favourite chocolate on valentines day
Coming from a guy who has dated a Vegan. When you date a Vegan, you will become vegan/closet meat eater. But when you leave each other, you will without a doubt start eating meat again. Us guys, or the majority of us, tend to live the life styles our significant others do because we like to please. I wouldn't say it was too much of a bother to do it, but you do miss a nice steak when you live that lifestyle under those circumstances.
I’m so happy for you both 💜 it’s so sweet to see the trash taste guys so happy for you as well. Did they really not know at all for real? haha  I love how Connor not showering properly is the biggest reason not that you don’t like men 😂😂
Cause she is a legend!
yeah congratulations !! to the both of you. I remember a sakura festival video, where Sharla had moved to Sendai, and was thinking, hey doesn't Chris also live there . . . .  OK, Best wishes, bye.
I too was devastated when YouTubers Roger and Dave announced their break-up
I really like Chris, seems super cool, but hard enough to make stuff like this work without everyone staring into the fishbowl at you.
Jasper is beautiful as well. However, Vancouver Island is more beautiful than Banff
Kaho Shibuya was not available,innit?Just kidding.Enjoy and be happy,mate
let her know where your will is going before u marry her fam. and never give a woman access to your bank. and you're good.
When will she evolve to charizard tho
I'm honestly so glad! After watching you two separately on your respective channels, I've loved both of you. I'm glad you two are together, because you two are amazing people. :)
Congrats 🎊
It has everything to do with you two and nothing to do with anyone else, so you were quite right not to tell anyone!  Congrats to you both, I hope all goes well
Thanks for clearing it up. I seem to be one of the only ones who was really confused after Sharlas Video because I was unsure if she just said it as a joke or really meant it
Everyone knew, hope you guys have many happy years.
Aloha 🌺 Congratulations!,💖
Happy for both of you 🥳
this is from her channel, i was surprised but kinda expected it tbh  https://youtu.be/vvG9-j8HVm8?t=817
I knew it   I hope both your love blossoms into something beautiful
What is that on your head?
i was hoping for this ever since i saw you 2 together in their journey of japan series
If you knew Japanese to pick up jap women over there, you would not be dating her.
Hey man! If you ever do come up to Banff would be cool to see you in person. Would make the trip up... But seriously, Banff? Would suggest you go to the Columbia Valley (not that much farther) for the hot springs. Recommend Fairmont hot springs over radium. Banff is an overblown, overpaid tourist trap. Too busy, crowded... Cheers mate, and wish you both well!
Congratulations you two! Connor is not that bad if you had swung that way.
YAyyy! I had my fingers crossed for you two!! Couldn't adore either of you More!!! Huge Congrats!!!! 😍🤩😘♥
This was a seldom and delightful  "I knew it" moment for me
I was under the impression that you two have been together for years.... I'm very out of touch
We just want you to be happy Chris!
I thought you were also gay, best of luck to you man!
You may or may not see this, but my son and I have been watching your vids for years now as we both are massive lovers of pretty much all things Japan and desire to go there someday but, regardless of who you're dating, I felt genuine happiness for you despite not knowing you. Youve seemed to have a harsh opinion on yourself throughout your vids and as a guy who has the same issue it's nice to know someone appreciates you. May both of you find happiness together and thanks for 10 years of content
Good on you both! So that's what that glow was these few months. Cheers!
Congrats
I made more noise than I thought I would at this news. Happy for you two.  😃
I thought this was going on for a while. Canadians and Brits are so easy to read 😂  On a serious note, I am SO HAPPY for both of you! Y'all are gonna be the most precious and sweet couple! I am absolutely happy for both of you!
I thought Chris was dating natski....what?
I hope it goes well!! a nasty break up woudn't be great, as I love both of you :) but I would pick Sharla if I had to.... she just makes better content.
I knew something was up when sharla was in the UK during the time chris was there. Btw, when did they first got together??
Because she’s letting you?
One of your ask abroad vids, I asked why you and her arent dating a long time ago  lol
And what happens to Natsuki, now?
Cris you have doon what I believed no fat guy could ever do ( no offense) I know have hope that gay guys can get skinny girls
Best wishes and much happiness
❤️❤️❤️
So happy for you guys!  Hope to see more of her on your channel when time allows. :)
Congratulations! I'm happy for you and Sharla!
I have being waiting for you two to finally start dating for so looooooong! ❤️❤️
She’s a lovely girl… but a vegi, I definitely would need a meat eater lol
Mate, I've been watching your show for years and always fealt you were a bit lonely! So happy for you man! Keep on making wicked content, you really helped me before my trip to Japan in 2017 👍👍👍👍
Sharla is NOT affable.
Colonize & gentrify
Congrats, my dude!
Chris:  ...so the reason y is- Jealous Natsuki: "Go fuk yurself"
I'd pick Natski as a best man, in your shoes, because his best man speech would be a treat to hear in his amusing engrish.
Nice, good for her. I thought her previous boy friend looked like seaweed.
when i saw the Sharla clip i was sure it was a meme cause of how much they all joke about dating each other lol
LOL I guess I was one of those who missed this announcement!! 😅 But Congrats!! I love both of you guys' channels. I am so happy for the both of you!! 😍
I knew they had chemistry in a video from a few years ago 🥰🥰🥰
(Me being Canadian) ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!  Congrats man.   What ever shall poor Conor do when he wants to rebuff questions about his dating life now? Can he barrow Natsuki?
is connor a priest? XD
おめでとう! 😊😊
Bro, this could have been a short. Why I'm dating a Canadian: "Because she's delightful." /Video
Congrats!!!!  Yeahie!!!  Well-deserved with you brother Chris and Sharla!  God bless you both.
Chris I've never seen so much color in your pasty complexion!    I have to say its rather charming.   Congrats to the both of you.
Glad to see you happy Chris
Lol good for you guys; adulting ftw 👍
I’m so happy for them^^ wish u guys much happiness❤️
Congrats :)
siii!!!
What a long time coming. Congrats
So Connor is available?
Lets Goooo Chris, better luck next time Connor.
Your'e punching above your weight lad.😉 Even a miserable old bastard like me smiled at the anouncement. Look after each other.
So cute you got a second wife beside Connor xD Congrats!
It's like Chris is a single father keeping his relationship from his kids until he's sure, cuz he doesn't want his kids to get attached in case something bad happened.
New that was going to happen.  Congrats you two!
Usually I just lurk but I really wanted to say congratulations and that I'm super happy for you both!!
I married one, she wouldn’t let me poutine till we did.
Congats; I'm going to the uk soon  what  are the best crisps?
yeah why the fuck are you dating a canadian??????? date me im american america #1
It doesn't matter who you are dating…a Canadian, American, British, boy, girl…as long as both of you are happy! Your close friends must have known before the announcement so their reaction is fake?
THANK YOU GOD
You're not dating a Canadian, you are dating THE bread girl
Glad things have been going well for you both. She seems to be a lovely person!
I approve because she is Canadian and as a Canadian I am happy
God bless you guys! This news has made my entire year! Congratulations, Chris and Sharla in Japan!
God bless the diet question. This was my biggest question as well 😂
Congratulations to you and Sharla! Wishing for both your happiness!!
Lots goes on in Canada Chris. Yes it’s very good. But I’m Canadian so I’m a bit biased.
I can vouch for the cat allergy diminishing when you own a cat. When I was a kid I used to have a cat allergy, similar to yours with the itchy skin and sniffles.  But then we got a cat and I guess my body got used to it. Now I love cats and they only give me sniffles if they’re all up in my face for too long.
I'm fr happy for u, Chris.   When u fr are in a legit good relationship,  man it's soo refreshing.  I'm in one now nd we fr love each hard lop
date your bros
This was meant to be almost like the leading Mcs of a romance anime. This was prewritten in history
FINALLY
LETS F**KIN GOOO!!!
No longer goes by Abroad in Japan, getting ready for Abroad in Canada
Anytime you come to Canada and go to Banff, save a lot of money as it will scare the pants off of you how expensive it is, and I live in Alberta and we cannot afford the prices of the hotels there.
Welp, there you have it folks. Chris is not gay! Now for the remaining question. Is Connor gay?
Those look like Siberian cats. It's said that Siberian cats are so unbreed cats that they rearly effects people with allergy.
Connor isn't Canadian?
Poor Connor lol
Save some money flying across Canada? From BC to Quebec?  Who's going to tell him?
Sharla is pretty chill, happy for the both of you
Firstly, I'm very happy for Chris and hyped for the potential collabs (their Mt. Fuji video is one of my favorites) Secondly: Hang in there Connor! You'll get over it man🙏
I think anybody who watches Abroad in Japan saw this coming forever ago...maybe now Chris will be a tad less miserable 🤣
everybody knew it since Shimanami Kaido
I swear Connor's reaction is the funniest out of the video 😆
You and Sharla should definitely visit Banff one day if you can! I do think you guys would love the scenery and food.
I can't be the only one wanting to ask questions related to the Airbus thrust levers that have now made an appearance in at least 2 episodes!
Chris we are British we don't need a visa to go Canada
does she he runs on drugs with about 40? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpIVXapbe08
Sugoi!! Aw what great news! May the mystery to love and romance never be solved, but always afoot for you both xx
It is absolute goals to come across as gay with the homies; it means you have a friendship so close that people who haven't experienced it could only imagine its a relationship
I have cat allergies, and I have found the main reason why my allergy would vary from cat to cat is due to the quality and type of cat litter. It also matters if they are outdoor cats or what they sleep on. I'm highly allergic to wool, so anyone who sleeps on this or wears it is not a person I can be around, for example. I learned this while pet sitting, which was a huge relief to know it isn't only the dander or the fact they lick and groom themselves, so not a saliva allergy. I am glad to hear you are seeing how you are adjusting to her two adorable cats. I hope what I shared helps you figure how to be more comfortable around the.
I'm single and Chris has a girlfriend. There is hope
Omg I thought Sharla was just joking, but I'm so freaking happy she wasn't. I'm so happy for you two!
Yayyyy!!!!!
Happy for you both, wish you all the best!
I fucking knew it!
You have family in Montreal?? Go visit Montreal when you can, next time. It's the better part of Canada 😉 🇨🇦  (Also, the province of Québec is where the strategic Maple syrup reserves are 🍁)
Awwwww happy for you both!
Every time I hear Chris speak I think it’s Jules Holland, all that’s missing is the piano playing. X
I knew it.
It's wonderful to see how much your eyes sparkle, Chris, when you talk about Sharla and your relationship with her. It's so sweet 💕
he doesn't shower but he does take a bath in every hotel
Holy **** finally. Took you long enough XD.
Interesting fact, it’s not cat hair people are allergic to but it’s cat saliva. Cats constantly clean themselves hence anyone with a cat allergy who pets them will experience an unfortunate allergic type response. You can reduce the severity of your allergy through controlled exposure therapy, provided you’re not one of those unfortunate people that experience anaphylaxis (severe life threatening allergic response). Anyhoo, glad to hear you’re dating!
The long slow burn of candy man sex appeal  ;) ;)   Congrats bud!
You acclimated. It happens with me and animals all the time. If it’s an animal I haven’t been around before or for a while, I have really bad reactions. After some time I acclimate and my reactions get less severe.
Chris is treading on thin ice, dating a Canadian is one step from dating an American
Nice lie chris we will definitely believe such lies to evade our eyes from ur dangerous and wild relationship with connor >:)
I'm so happy <3 you have such cute complimentary vibes and energy that's so wholesome to see <3 I adore your chemistry <3 <3<3 this is a great video to start the day
The only comment that came to my mine was "ABOUT BLOODY TIME!" >_> lol. And I really hope that you two grow together continue to make each other happy for many years to come. I hope your lives are adventurous and fulfilling together. Your allergy does not go away, but rather your body begins to recognize the dander and that your body isn't supposed to attack itself when it comes in contact with it. lolol. If you go around new cats, you may still find you have just as severe a reaction as you first had to Maro and Tuna. If you do have to take an allergy pill, it's cool. I literally have to take one everyday to breathe and you know, not die. It isn't the worst thing in the world, and cats pretty much ARE the best thing in the world, so it evens out. lolol
love has no boundary tho..  just like Chris love of Famichicky / Familymart Kaarage & fried Chicken.   loves sure works in absurd way.
Congratulations 🎊
I was watching Pewdiepie's vid but was only paying half attention. I easily recognized Connor but didn't recognize you until the camera panned to your belly 😅 I immediately went like "Is that Chris?"   Anyway, happy for you and Sharla.
When did you start this channel?? I’ve been watching the other main channel  Have I missed much here ?? Let’s have a look at the videos
And wtf is this “my sweet pee pee” furby cow ad before the video 😂😂😂😂
Also, what headband is that!? It’s obnoxious and I love it
What the cats society don't want to tell anyone. There actually is no such thing as cat allergies, but if the cat decides he/she doesn't like... achoo.
Glad to hear you are not gay and dating Charlotte. She is a great girl. Next question… Kids ??
10 years in the future: *Abroad in Canada*    *Journey Across Canada*
I knew it all along
The first time I saw you two I knew it congratulations 💞🎉💞🎉
I usually stop getting along with people after a few months. It wasn't until someone asked me if I liked him (as a person) that I realized I liked him (more than just as a person.) We were able to talk about almost anything with each other. Unfortunately there's a no fraternizing policy so it sucks. With Covid  being persistent I haven't seen him in a couple years. If I had tried getting to know him by dating it might not have lasted as long as being friends has. I tend to get nervous in social situations. All the best to the two of you. You might need allergy medicine when shedding season hits. There's a lot more dander than usual. My cat allergy went through cycles of severity. If Natsuki ever does give a best man's speech in English, I hope you film it. It would probably be adorable and an interesting usage of swears.
I'm gonna be honest @Chris Abroad, I though you and Connor were banging, and in a serious homoerotic relationship, based on how many 5 star hotels and doggy hotels you too have been in. i have seen married couples of 30 years do less and go less in their entire life time. Well that makes for one less thought at the back of my mind. Nothing wrong with it tho, if you and Connor do decide to get in on, my full support, On ya mate. Sure his fans will fully endorse a English daddy power couple relationship. Fuckin Oath if you read this. <3
I knew you two would hook-up, you are perfect for each other.  Take good care of that sweet lady, or you will have to answer to all of Canada.
the answer to the question is, none of our business.
Whoa there, I think this prank's gone a bit too far    Connor's gonna be so hurt there mouse
Back when you guys visited that beautiful temple in the mountain i commented that you two would make a great couple, little did I know you all were already dating 🤣.  I had the same reaction as Connor and the guys, it was the best day!!  I know it sounds ridiculous but i was really happy 😊
Well, congrats and good luck with that I suppose. Never really got along well with the Canadian women I worked with in Japan. Meat isn't the problem, it's the processed seed oils and carbs that it's deep fried in. Those unstable seed oils start out "innocent" by "not containing trans fat" but as soon as they are heated to high temperature over and over they become 100% trans fat. So cut out the deep fried shit and processed carbs and you'll be fine.
At long last I always thought they would be cute together. I really enjoyed their energy in journey across Japan. Congrats to them both ❤️
OMG!!!!! The way my jaw dropped when I saw the title and the thumbnail!! Congrats guys I’ve been waiting forever for this news 😂
Chris was never fruity to me. Hes more like British Fancy.
Connor is now maddenless
Called it!
Hopefully this doesn't lead to any comments about Chris punching above his weight or anything like that, suppose it was inevitable given the type of content that it'd have to be addressed but really it's no one's business but theirs, just be happy for em
You hound dog Chris, get in!
Mr steal your wife 😂
I knew you two will be dating someday since I've seen your chemistry during that bike journey you had when she joined you for a few days. That was long ass time ago, but I got the vibes back then.
I KNEW IT! lol congrats you guys glad it's going so well. It truly is the best dating a friend. You already know each other well so there's no need to put on a fake best face. All the best to you too! 🥳💜🎉
Very cute
People were assuming Chris was Gay AND European, turns out it wss just the latter.
I love this!!!
Yess, knew it was only a matter of time!!! Who's surprised? nah, not me
10:25 well, shit! Dating is even harder than I thought! Who could've guessed that you need friends for that?
So you’re saying if Conor showered….
Congratulations 🎉
my friends when they hear I survived my brain surgery: "cool bro" my friends when they learn I am dating someone: 0:12
Congratz!  You are 100% right about dating friends.  The best relationships start with friend ship.  I hope it works out well for you both!
I absolutely knew it because you have appeared in each other videos and you guys look absolutely great together, The gay thing sparked up in one or her videos when you said or boy friend Connor
I can explain the cat thing. It's if the owner shower's the cat. I have the same problem.
Congratulations mate she's such a hotty. I'd keep her mate. Lovely girl. Good on you boyo
Congrats Chris mate all the best to you two. 🤞🏾
Good for you both!
Congrats!
9:20 what about ryotaro,pete? Would he be the mc? 🤣
Good for you Chris!
I thought sharla is married to a Korean guy and moved to Seoul? 🤔
0:11 THE QUAD REACT
#lifeadvice: the best relationships is with a friend  Connor: so there's still a chance?
Banff is a huge tourist trap. Would not recommend. But all up and down the rockies are beautiful places. Come on down fella.
As a Canadian, hell yeah Chris. hell yeah
the best part about the announcement was the clips of connor and garnt cheering chris and sharla on, thats how you know your friends are good is when they literally cheer your dating announcement
happy that youre happy to talk about it, but its was obvious that you both have been dating for nearly a year to anyone with a plus 40 years of age iQ level.. Glad for you Both  suited :))))
Well about fucking time Chris.
In the nicest possible way…you’re punching. Look after her Chris!
I Love You for each other! 2 talented, good looking, intelligent, successful YouTubers. You're wonderful friends first and that's important. Here mate, pushed subscribe just for that!!😎👍
I knew it would happen at some point
Coz you need us visa..
i legit thought they were dating for so long now and it was all public
Chris is just throwing smoke to hide his relationship with Connor.
Just admit that you're dating Connor
you need to marry her you look 50
I've always thought that you and Sharla had great chemistry. Happy for you both.  I'm glad Pete's okay.
Aww Congratulations Chris and Sharla!!!🥳🥳🥳🎉 You both are amazing and have such amazing personalities. I hope you both enjoy your relationship ^_^ God Bless and Happy Sunday!^_^❤💕💯
Omg. He figured out how to leave the friend zone and cant remember how it happened 😭
2:53 "No I'm not gay" *wears rainbow headband*
Will Wacky Weekend change to Lovey Dovey weekend with Sharla instead of Connor ?
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎈
Congrats
I'm so happy for you guys and no I didn't think you were gay lol friends just have fun but don't do anything haha pay attention people lol 😆😆😆😆😆
If you ever come to Montreal lets make a meet and greet ! and eat alot ou Poutine ahah !
Ryotaro not even being considered for the best man position 😶
where do i watch this full stream?
congrats chrissy poo
We are currently visiting my brothers and sisters in Victoria, BC after traversing most of the Provinces from Saskatchewan on a summer road trip from Madison, Wisconsin! We love Victoria! Congratulations to you and Sharla! Wish you both all the best!
Natsuki as presented is a true friend indeed,not many of us have a genuine mate like him, a friend for life,always true never blue. Number one to you Natsuki.
I’m Japanese, ended up with a Canadian wife and now we have 2 kids. Crazy how small the world can be.
Happy for you Chris. Happy for you both.
Finally! If more time passed, you would’ve probably ended up dating Joey.
Chris - congrats! Long time viewer. Awesome to see the accompanying excitement for your and Charlotte’s relationship. An epic ride 🤙 All the best ❤️
meh...you're gonna lose your cat hating subscribers.
Posh vibes from the two of you
Bout time you were dating a chick. I'd been worrying about you, always hanging out and jumping in spas with dudes that seem to lack a bit in the manly department.
Who the hell cares. (except Chris himself) I'm more interested about the coming videos.
I f**k knew it!! They whay he did flirt like a school boy at one of her videos, i knew it! Yes!!
This video presents the intriguing alternate reality scenario of "Abroad in Canada".
generally, allergies can either go away overtime or stay; you can develop allergies for something overtime; and you can also develop resistance to allergies if you are in contact with it many times(although it is not recommended to do this if you have a heavy allergy on it) this resistance will also revert if you are not in contact with that thing anymore for a long while.
Salute to you, ma nigga
Have you at least entertained the idea of daving Roger?
Congratulations.  I honestly did think you were gay ;)    Natsuki is the best friend everyone needs…
Congrats! You two have always had such good chemistry on screen! It's nice to see that it has blossomed into a romantic relationship! All the best for the future! (from a Canadian currently in Montreal!)
Connor doesn't shower because when is the last time you've seen a monke shower?
Are two men truly friends if it doesn’t seem a little gay lol
Finally
I agree with Chris that you should never haste to publicize your dating/relationship status until you're entirely sure that it's working. I mean, lost of people brag about their new relationships when it's really just about their momentary excitement but they weren't really sure about each other.
I'm happy for you both. 💜
Like When Harry met Sally!❤️
seeing all my favorite japan/anime youtubers ending up together makes me literally so happy this is so cute i wish you guys all the happiness in the world!!
... because we're awesome?
Chris, I think it's just because you're British people assume that you're gay. haha
North American girls hit different.
I'm also dating one of my best friends. Its great advice! Congrats to both of you
With all due respect Chris, what’s the meaning of this video?  Something I don’t get about any given YouTuber is the necessity to explain aspects of their personal lives to a whole bunch of people who didn’t have to know those details about your personal life.  Sure, you love filmmaking and I respect that aspect of you as a person, but you don’t need to share every single detail about you.    I am a nobody saying this, just sharing my POV.
Apples innit
congrats mate thats wonderful to hear that your happy and you have found someone <3
How safe is Japan really? Everybody always says there's no crime to be had.
Dude, if it works between Aki and Joey, why shouldn't it work for you guys?
Sharla seems like a wonderful person. I've been subscribed to both channels for years, forget which longer. Congrats to both.
PUMP OUT THEM KIDDOS , COLONIZE JAPAN
Saw you two together and knew it was meant to be, blessings
the Ferry from  Vancouver BC to Victoria is a beautiful ride, and that's coming from someone who grew up taking the other ones in the Sound.
Don't take it personally. Americans are terrible at assuming Brits are inherently gay.
Good for you guys
Congrats Chris :D
Congrats Chris 🎉🎉  Looking forward for the new partner of Wacky Weekend or Journey Across Japan.
U looks more fit now Chris
Wait, what? Sharla is from Victoria?????????  Holy Ra this is a small world. I am a Brit living in Berkeley, California, USA since late 2016. Before that I always lived in the UK and only vacationed in other countries. Two of these vacations, back in the summers of 2005 and 2006, were to Victoria to meet up with internet friends from back then.  Wild, maaaan.
not going to lie, a little jealous but I wish the best.
Thank goodness she can make an honest man out of ya...LOL...Congratulations, great videos...
I’m not into stanning or shipping or whatnot, but I must admit it’s deeply satisfying that you two have finally become an item
My allergies went the other way.  I grew up with feral barn cats and played with them as a kid -- nothing.  Then I hit 21 and suddenly my eyes swell and tear up and struggle breathing  unless I double or triple up on the Benadryl
I just totally see it! congrats!!
Man, I called this a while back. It's plain to see you guys have got serious chemistry - fair play to you both & wishing you the very best! xx
I also l8st my cat-aölergie after some time dating a guy with cats. It even turned out how much I love cats and now 20 years later I cannot imagine living without my current cats....or cats in general anymore! So watch out Chris they gonna steal your heart too!❤️😻🐾meow🐈‍⬛
What an absolute betrayal. I can’t believe you’ve done this. Poor Connor must be heart broken.
Why you're dating a Canadian?  Well coming from another Canadian, that's an easy answer! 🇨🇦
- I've been watching both you and Sharla's videos for awhile now so I'm super happy for the both of you!  - About losing your allergic-ness to cats as time went on......what's the secret? I've had 6 years at my wife's old cat filled house before we moved, but my allergies never got better. - The being friends first before dating definitely worked for me :) 10/10 highly recommend
The maple syrup reserves comment made me laugh real hard.   Kinda funny, I'm a Canadian dating a Brit myself... Anyways, I definitely understand not wanting to mention it until things have been going for a while. Congrats.
10th years youtube channel anniversary and dating the girl who inspired you to create a channel. Sounds like living the dream, no?
if you are around something you have allergies to like cats and stuff your body gets use to them to some extent
Love conquers allergies!
Why? Because she said, “yeah, why not?”
Happy for you 2. <333
Very happy for you both and wishing you all the best in the future :)
dating Canadian women is a sign of being gay
Does anyone know what's with the Thrustmaster throttles did I miss the memo that Chris is into flight sim?
Yes but can Chris cook a rice omelette?
ohhh i love it

Im happy for you
I was literally in Banff and Canmore today. You've got great taste Chris!
So Chris wanted some Canadian happiness
Wah :D ... a Brit talking - at large - about (his own) matters of heart! The world is upside/down !! (and probably Chris' nose needs some maple syrup, after all the rubbing..)
Cut down the carbs Chris! Below 100g a day, ideally below 50g a day. Fats will melt away like magic!
Congratulations Chris and Sharla! To good people together is an awesome thing. 😁
Y'ALL ARE SO CUUUUUTE!!!!!!!!!! SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH!!!!!!! :D
Chris: I first saw you and Sharla interacting in the Journey Across Japan segments that featured her, and it was obvious that you two were a great match — I mean as *_friends_* who were comfortable with each other. It was just a pleasure to watch the magic between you two. Sharla gets you. You belong together.   BTW, I've been allergic to cats all my life, but one day I saw this cat in trouble and I saved his life. Ever since then, he's been my cat, and I'm his humanoid. I'm still allergic to cats, but I'm not allergic to him.
Canadians are the best - grew up on the Michigan-Ontario border, can confirm.
Congrats!! Also more Pete impersonations please
You two are SO CUTE!!! ^_^ Love you all. "Thank you, God!" Hehehehehehe. AWWWWWW!
congrats mate. may your relationship flourish
I always knew you guys would date someday it’s been obvious throughout the years that you guys liked each other.
Giving me Elon Musk vibes in this video
And definitely come to Banff. I feel like everyone needs to see Banff/Canmore/kananaskis.
you two are such a wonderful couple - especially because you were friends first 👏👏👏
I still feel like I’m being screwed with. Literally, my two favourite YouTubers, I barely have words. This is amazing. Over the moon happy for the both of you.
Ever since I saw a video of you two together, I kind of wondered, like I am sure like everyone else. On one particular occasion you were both filming separate, but traveling together. Sharla was buying a type of Japanese ice cream and talking about the flavors (hopes this rings a bell). I noticed you appeared to had wanted to speak to her, but she kind of veered away. I knew that either you both had dated or that you were trying to work something out. Relationships can be tricky, however you both have so much in common and like everyone else in the world wish you much luck in that department.
Natsuki's wonderful!  :)  Keep bringing him on your show, when it works for you :)
Dating someone from Canada 🇨🇦 makes you bear / wolf proof.
Live in Canada? With TRUDOLF?
As if everyone didn't see this coming.
Atlast!!!
Does that mean, Chris does less papakatsu?
Chris is not gay?
Its so weird ive never been so hyped for 2 people to get into a relationship since these 2. Super Happy.
So Chris may have given us a clue at how long. At the end he said after 5 or 6 years, find out you're a good fit with a friend. So sounds like they been together under two years 🤔
I've been following both you and Sharla for years, and I almost cried when she confirmed you were dating LOL I don't really *ship* real people, so I had never really thought about it before, but once she said it I was like, "wow, yeah they would be great together!" So I am very happy for both of you!
I married my husband after 7 years of solid friendship. Been together almost 16 years. I agree completely. The best relationships I've ever had have been built on a foundation of friendship. Congrats, I've "shipped" you two quietly for a long time! 😘❤
I married my wife within 7 months 🤣.But really, best thing that ever happend to me. Still married after 12 years and still madly in love with her 💞
Nothing better then a ship becoming cannon
I saw the tension for years, it’s like saying the sky is blue lol
My husband has a cat allergy and we have two cats lol he has definitely acclimated to them, and he only starts to have a reaction if we don't vacuum for a while 😆
Really nice to hear that you are happy. xx
Canada is boring AF if you are used to Japan. Come here for retirement xD
Why don’t you guys get married?
Yay straight pride!!!
It's made syrup isn't it? Got to be.
Connor and Joey as flower girls because Joey would be enthusiastic but Connor wouldn't survive because he'd feel awkward in front of people and wouldn't recover.
Have you seen the movie bullet train yet? It takes place in japan on a shinkansin train. He jams the door in-between the cars with a umbrella and suitcases. A mascot gets punched in the face. It has alot of Japanese culture in it but no ekiben.
So happy for you guys. I always thought you guys have great chemistry All the best to the two of you🥰
7:00 the fact that he kept this photo all these years😌
I’m definitely gay and I never got that vibe from you. It’s like, can’t a bloke just be generally nice with their male friends without being gay??
I'm so happy for you guys 💕
Nice that you are dating someone, but you don't have to be gay to date men you can be heteroflexible, bisexual, or homoflexible...BTW don't ignore it sexuality is not a choice!
Chris’s American accent is awesome!
My (now adult) child  has a lot of different allergies, cats being on that list.  We had adopted a kitten and my poor kid was a mess, he loved that cat something fierce, but he could not breathe and was reduced to taking allergy pills constantly.  We got the cat spayed, and found her a new home with one of my friends.  The allergy doctor actually told us that a cat allergy (respiratory) can be cat breed specific.  The best way to test this (also kinda the funniest) is to scoop a cat stuff your face into their fur and inhale.  If you retract sneezing, or going into anaphylaxis, you are allergic to that breed...move on to a different breed and keep your epi-pen handy.  My son wants to do this in order to find a breed he is not allergic to in order to have a pet. 🤔
Nice... You should come to haida gwaii.
Natski is YOUR best friend, but you're not his.  LOL
It may not be a real allergy, just a contact allergy.  I grew up with dogs and cats.  No allergy problems.  Then I moved away from home, only had cats for years, but when I visited my sister who only has dogs, I would be sneezing and eyes swelling.  But once I stayed a little while (less than a month) when I moved in with her, the allergy totally went away.  I wasn't really allergic, just had a mild, temporary reaction to a new thing in my environment.
I thought she was married to a Korean gentleman
Why?  The heart is mysterious.
Ive always heard both sides of dating your close friends and have personally seen some shit go down so its relieving to hear that its actually a good thing
I also have a cat allergy but now own one and didn't have a problem with my BF's cat either. It all has to do with the coat length and salavia . Funny enough, who knew? Just have to find the right cats. Funny enough my ex's cat makes me sneeze. Fate then..
abroad in japan and sharla in japan, already the same last name
Straight guy  here.... Not for Nothing Connor is a good looking guy.. I'm surprised that he's not cleaning up in japan.. Japanese women  are all about Flash..
AWWWWW SO CUTE!!!! Congratulations!!! You both deserve so much happiness! 💗
Good Business  move!!
I am so happy for Chris! You could always tell he was in love with her. 💖
Quite weird ever since I first time saw sharla in your vids I got the feeling you would end up together
SharBroad? Or BroadLa? Either way, love it! You two are amazing together!
"maybe we gave out those vibes" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
OK, I can't stop laughing at that reaction to 2 grown adults dating (*screaming & "thank you God!") What were they thinking was happening otherwise hahahaha
What distance is between your studio and her inn? My concern is if you two become really serious one of you might have to give up one or both.
why you didnt mentioned grant man, you just said natsuki, connor and joe but no grant(garnt). just saying
I am happy for both of them. Chris did say and post on his Patreon that he has had a tough year- so having not just friends but someone to be there is nice and hopefully relieves some pressure.
Happy for you both.
EEEEHEHEHEHEHEEEE. This is sweet, I'm happy for you both! Y'all are cute and I think it's nice that you've got a companion. Y'all take care of yourselves. The public hype shipping train isn't important, what's important is you're happy. I look forward to seeing more Sharla on your channel, more folks goofing around and causing chaos is always nice. <3 Grats on the kitty acclimation too!!
I like how nowadays you have to mention that you have nothing against gay people when you’re saying that you’re not one of them. Like if you’re a straight white male, you’re automatically homophobic and racist. Sick world we live in.
CONGRATULATIONS CHRIS!! Poor Connor 😂
Men, Faveeee couple on the Internet, love how you compliment eachother, Sharla's sweetness and Chris... well, Chris. ahaha loove you guys! greetings from Latinamerica
I can only wish the best for you both! I enjoy watching the stories you both present so to have a union between you too is very cool!
Ever since the first JAJ I thought you 2 had wonderful chemistry. Im not one to "ship" but im happy for you guys thats awesome!
INSANE^^But I'm so happy for you two <3
I know this gonna happen
I thought you'd been dating for years! I foresaw it.
Now I somehow imagine a kid sitting in a japanese school with the most blue eyes and the brightest of blonde hair and speaking japanese casually.
We know that Ironmouse sometimes put on her  Chris-Abroad- robot-suit and we know that she is a good friend of Connor. So It could be that Connor has a Charla-robot-suit. Now that Chirs and Charla are dating, its going to be like a anime romcom. With confusing moments and stuff. I bet everything is going to be alright in the end :T
Does this dude reply to comments? If yes, good luck with the new lady.
Get you a friend like CDawgVA. His reaction was amazing
Woah. I knew Sharla had roots in Victoria but the fact that Chris might also show up in my neck of the woods someday is surreal to imagine!   P.S. Can confirm Banff is beautiful, but so is all of Vancouver Island! No I’m not biased at all wdym…
What is Conor going to do with his life now? How can he ever recover from this? He's probably a full blown alcoholic now. And Chris it's all your fault. If he goes to that suicide forest for a visit then you know what's happening
Cutting down on meat and eating healthy dont belong in the same sentence at all. At all.
Hey Chris if you go to Canada make sure you go to some remote areas and look for sasquatch. Lots and lots of encounters and sightings.
Start showering people, maybe you'd all have a shot with Mr. Abroad
You'll probably see 2 types of comments:  1. Congrats, We're proud, still can't believe it etc..... 2. Chris Gay, Chris is dating *insert meme*
I KNEW IT!!! 😂♥️
dno But u can have dual citizenship if you find a jew. under the floor boards.
As a Canadian in long-term relationship with a Scotsman, I approve. We must strengthen the Commonwealth.
Connor is the only one who still single
Her taste in men is terrible
Because she is just a object to you to splash everywhere in public , it won’t last
Told you
Can’t believe so many people care lol
lol
It was very common for fellas to have fictional Canadian girlfriends when I was growing up. Cool that you found a real one.
So does this mean that you'll be dating Sharla "Outside" Japan?
you can lose you're allergie for a cat while still being allergic to cats overall.
Yes Cat and Dog allergies can go away I was severely allergic to cats as a kid I would literally be crying and puffing sneezing etc. From playing with my aunts cats but after a year or so It went away granted as soon as I stopped having cats around me (it's been around 6 years since I've had a cat) my allergies have somewhat returned not as bad but they did.
Poor Conor 😭💔 Haha only joking 😝 No I actually always thought you two would make a really cute couple. Best of luck to you both 🥰🥰
ahhhh this is so cute. I knew you guys were good together😍😍 I wish the best for you both ❤❤
Sharla should get rid of her cats.
I'm a Canadian living in Japan. I think Chris made a good pick!
Was so clear you was dating yo anyone who has been in relationships I could see it.
so... british colonializing canada? no new news
Yeessssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!
Uhm, saying that something is "10/10 - IGN" doesn't exactly imply that it's amazing.
Trying to date a friend has always ended in me being rejected and the friendship being broken. I lost everything and won nothing 😖
That’s awesome! I have been watching Chris and Sharla make a million videos together and right off the bat I saw they had great chemistry
This is Garnt's wife! is this a netorare story arc?
The bost to you both, Chris and Sharla. God bless to you both.
Finally! ❤️
NEW CHANNEL CONFIRMED??? Abroad in Canada?
I like the outro music a lot! but cant find it! and don't know what the genre is called... help?
"And also, another important point, I'm not gay." This should not have illicited an actual laugh out loud.... But it did. Congrats! Hope it works out for you. *cough*longtimeviewerfirsttimecommenter*cough*
Was that a secret? I found your channel only a while ago and always had the impression you two are dating.
It's so fucking weird how Connor doesn't shower. No wonder everyone was awkward with him in the intimate pole-dancing video with him.
Are you guys getting married soon???
Many congratulations to you both. You make a lovely couple and yes, head for Banff. Especially the Banff Springs Hotel for High Tea. My favorite place for it. You won't be disappointed.  🇨🇦
Congratulations, wish you the best of luck and that the two of you are going to be happy with each other!  Also kudos on making the Queenie proud, bringing the Commonwealth back together relationship by relationship!
Chris I've been thinking bout moving to Canada too! It's like 10 miles away from me!!!
I would love to see some videos on vegetarian options in Japan!
Chris me mums had her appendix taken out on her birthday years ago!!!
Such good news. I thought you were a pillow biter!
Yay, I wonder if we went to school together at Lambrick Park in Vic, BC.  Love my hometown.  Would love to do a meet up if you guys ever visit.  Lots of great spots to visit.  Strangely very british here.  I could probably get you guys free passes to The Miniature World in the backside of The Empress Hotel.  Loved working there too with such friendly people <3
Good for you guys! I hope you guys stay happy for a long time!!! I'm really happy for you both!!
I knew it 😏😏😏
dude meat is healthy apples full of suger i garrentee if you cut suger from your life for a few months you will drop wait feel better less hyngry etc etc get your body using protean and fat as a fuel rather then storing it !:)
Cats send you certain DNA trait through air so you get manipulated and dominanted by them so you do their bidding. The allergy is your defence system trying to fight back against this manipulation or mind control.
Escape to Canada series!! 🇨🇦
Dating a Canadian gives you unlimited use to the word "sorry."
Wow 🤩 good luck to you guys
Love how happy the boys got when Sharla said it in her video, very very nice
mw roger and davif are dating ? ummmm
Yay grate!! As long she is not a Japanese woman I am fine 👍😅 Take care!!!
Get well soon, Animated American Pete!
Thank you, God!
You guys are cute!
ayy, come to Banff~ I can't say anything because I live REALLY close to Banff and I go there all the time, so like... Yeah, tired of it, but... Objectively, yes, it's a very nice place
reddit said u were a gay?
Hahah, aww bless :) Good for you! :)
ive felt the same relief that a parent does when their 40 yr old virgin child finally gets married
That would be amazing to see Christopher borat in Vancouver walking down east hastings.
I’d like to see them play video games together /against each other. Team Sharla on that one 🕹👾🎮
This makes me so happy! ❤️
I have been the happiest when I know this news!
i'm waitinggg XD (while watching the front)
I'm so happy for the two of you!
I’ve been wondering for quite some time already. :)
Abroad in Japan finally got a broad in Japan ;)
Great move, Chris.  I wondered what you were waiting for.  Clearly, Sharla is a wonderful girl and a great match for you.  I give your relationship an excellent chance for success.

Cool I always thought you two had great chemistry together and it's lovely to see you are in fact a couple now. It's pretty cool that you guys have such a close-knit circle of friends in your adventures in Japan (Natsuki, Joey, Ryotaro, and the Welshman). You're all a kind of family now.
Connor transitioned into Sharla.
New channel:  Two Broads in Japan   (and/or sitcom)
Congratulations! Can't wait to see the Break Up video!
It's funny that you still call her "Sharla in Japan" when her channel isn't called this for years 😝
Real life “Love is War” relationship
Knew it. Good luck, you seem really good together
My first boyfriend had a cat alergy and after some month it went away. We lasted 5years and he never had any allergy issue again n_n
bout  time , best to you both
Congrats Chris!!
Chris in Sharla, new channel idea.
i don't remember when but for me it been some time since I had some suspition about the news
I am super happy for Chris, cautiously optimistic for Sharla!
I knew it. I saw the subtle chemistry! I'm happy for you two. Enjoy, treat one another like the special gems you are, you both deserve ultimate joy!
So happy to hear that you and Charlotte are dating.  From your remarks I guess she is a vegetarian and slowly coming around.  I have to say you appear to have a healthy glow about you.  It really shows in your face.  I say this in all sincerity and out of love - don’t screw it up🙏👍🤪😎
The affable one is so smart he says he's dating Sharla just to cover up his relationship with Connor. Bravo! 👏👏👏
marrow and chewna
I still have my jaw dropped even after 30 secs omfg i hope you both are happy!!!
I had a hunch since Sharla moved to Sendai and was like “….. WAIIIT A MINUTE”
Congratulations Chris, I would also like a 9% plum drink
After 6 or 10 years??? Mayte, do you think I got a spare decade in my life for that?!?! xD
I love that Connor not showering is more of an issue for you than not being gay.
My bf was allergic to cats but we JUST started dating and tbh I was like not sure if you’ll be around forever but this cat will do I WILL be getting this cat. And now 3 years later him and the cat are best friends and literally all his allergies have subsided. Must be an exposure thing. Anyways SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS! 💕 10/10 as you say
Broke my leg running to watch this video
The only downside to making this public is that if you break up that'll probably have to be public too.
wishing you nothing but 10/10s all the way through my guy
Damn Chris i never thought you would ever be able to pull a girl from Japan. Well technically you haven't still.....
Adorable!! ❤️
Whooo Chris, now you have a camera operator for each of your channels. Best wishes and congratulations on finding someone special.
Happy for you!!
You guys are just meant to be. I'm soooo happy for you both!!!! Awwww, this is sooo cute!!!!
👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳💖💖💖💖 So much love to both of you!! I have a question..... Would Connor and Joey have to wear a dress for the wedding OR Naska have to wear a monkey suit (kinda more of a onesie like suit) for the wedding? Because you guys are always pulling pranks on one another, it's kinda like the last "WHO-RAW!" for your crazy journey all together before you two get hitched. Just take your time, and have fun being in the bf/gf stage because you two can look back on it and make even more strong bounds after the "I Do's" are made.
Congratulations! U even thought about who would be ur best man at ur wedding lol
Did people actually believe the joke about Chris and Connor being a thing? Kinda cringe.
Why are you dating a Canadian? Because you are very,  very lucky. Especially that Canadian.   See, nice guys may finish last; but affable ones win the lottery.   Best to you both.
Connor should date Iron-mouse in Person.
So excited for you guys!
As a tip, don't go to Banff. Or at the very least avoid staying there! Stay in Canmore instead! I'm not biased or anything because I grew up and also currently live in Canmore, and my dad runs a resort in Canmore... But it's only 30 minutes away from Banff, it's cheaper, and you're still surrounded by mountains with way less people around. You'll get better resorts out here that are a lot bigger and nicer then your standard hotel unless if you plan on staying at the fairmont resort (which is nice but kinda old). There's also a bus that goes to Banff from Canmore if you don't want to drive and honestly it's cheaper then driving and paying for parking in Banff (if you manage to find a spot). Seriously, you'll only want to actually be in Banff for one or two days before you'll want nothing to do with it. Also avoid the summer like the plague and come around the end of September. It will still be warm but if you're lucky you'll get the beautiful fall colours, and there is nothing like it seeing the mountains during the 1 week of fall that we get! Drumheller is also absolutely gorgeous at that time of the year too!  This is just some general advice btw, not just for Chris 😂.
Does this mean your will be a more responsible person, make better videos, and get them out in a timely manner?
You both bagged a 10
Nice try denying your homosexuality.
I dated my friend. This year was our 21 wedding anniversary
Congratulations, some advice. Love the other person freely, never stop courting,and keep being yourself.
Why can i imagine the Chris vs tuna ''ark'' starting lmao
Jeez guys, he's not gay, he's just British. Happy for your both I've always liked Sharla and your channel.
ハッピー!!!嬉しい!やった！！！So happy for you both! カナダから応援していまーす!😊
ChriSha is real ✨♥️
Best thing I’ve heard recently CONGRATS TO CHRIS AND SHALA IN JAPANNNNN🤍✨
Congratulations‼️‼️ I was just joking about Connor on a comment on Sharla’s announcement vod😸. Good luck beating meat Chris‼️😺
when dating a Canadian is so bad, you have to release a YT video explaining why
10/10 would date again - f**k! That killed me! Sounds like a future prediction, Chris. Love your videos!
Proud of you brother.
My wife was convinced you were dating Connor for the longest 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's so funny how we all act like we are in school again when it comes to people online or famous people and their personal business. "OMG they're dating?! I knew it!" I'm definitely guilty lol.
I can't wait for the union of the channels: Sharla in Abroad.
It was childish for me to want you guys together, but, now that you are? I really do hope you find lasting happiness… you’re both good people…
I'm happy you're dating Sharla in Japan. Does Sharmeleon know?
Broo it’s trending holy crap
It's so heartwarming to see two people I've watched for so many years get together. I'm happy you  both don't have to conceal your relationship anymore. 🤗
Sooo happy for you both <3
quite unexpected
So happy for both of you! Congratulations!
*reads title* Cause Sharmeleon is lovely and Canadians are amazing~
FINALLYYYYYY
I live with cats. Never heard of allergy
So is connor gay? 😆
Yeah my sister has a bad cat allergy but she also has a cat. But if she is around cats that she hasn’t seen before it will get really bad.
That impersonation was rather good 👍
Chris, I thought you was dating the real estate guy, having staycations all the time😀
You two make a good pair. I'm glad for you two. I was so upset for her unfortunate moments but you make up for all of it.
Honestly Chris, personally i'd lose a little respect for you if you didn't choose Natsuki to be a Best Man. Unless you chose a family member instead of course.
First Chris comes for our women, next...our maple syrup. SOMEONE STOP THIS MADLAD.
Heck yes!! You all are great together. I had a feeling there was something between you two.
Congratulations 🎉👏
I knew you two would get together.
Haha no worries about those cat allergies Chris. My uncle is allergic to cats while his children are all cat lovers and they have some cats in the house too. He takes meds for it and the kids just make sure the cats don’t go into his room. 😂😅
Besides a congratulations, and a thanks for a 'pure' Chris live, amazing outro part. Loving it  Keep it coming and a cheers to another 10 years of doing what you like to do
I had my suspicions when Sharla moved to Sendai. I am happy for you guys and I wish you all the best.
thanks for the video!
Abroad in Canada doesn't have the same ring ;)
Wow congrats dude. Not gonna lie with all the wacky weekend videos I thought you and Connor were dating. Like I would have bet a lot of money on that. Good for you though.
Yay! You both are great and I'm glad it's going well!
Also, Joey and Connor can be flowerboys at the wedding
HOW COULD YOU BREAK CONORS HEART LIKE THIS!!
Connor and Joey could be your flower girls at the wedding 🤣 xxx
Pleased for the both of you. ❤️
I have been waiting for this for a very long time, I  knew it was coming all along. Congratz!
I didn't know Connor was Canadian
Chris you lucky sod!
I thought Sharla's second cat name was... Luna...? And not Tuna...?
I thought sharla have a fiance
I can't see many problems with the cat allergy. By best friend has an allergy to pet fur and has had cats herself for years. The body adapts. Great pairing dude
Congratulations
What's become of Ryotoro, are you no longer friends?
Run Chris. Before it is too late.
I knew it!!!
Honestly it was obvious this was going to happen 😂 Congrats Chris!
i have always felt you guys look good together & i'm happy that you are now really dating! wishing you happiness both! ❤️
Good for you kiddo, bumpem
Can I be best man.... Pleaseeeeeeee, I'll plan an awesome Stag do and you can choose (Wakefield or wild card secret location) 🍾👍
Chris says,”Another important point, I am not gay!”- comedic delivery and timing was priceless - couldn’t stop laughing! Congrats to you and Sharla - big fans of both of you - All the best!
Congratulations!!! So happy to hear this news, I've been waiting for it for years... since at least the Halloween livestream you did together during Journey Across Japan. Really great to hear about two good people finding happiness together. You are both my favourite YouTubers in Japan, keeping me connected after returning from there to Canada many years ago. All the best!!
Why are you wearing a hair band?
Chris: allergic to cats Also Chris: Presenter of the world famous cat documentary, Cat Nation.
Yeah, same with me with cat allergies. I keep trying to convince people that having allergies doesn’t mean they can’t get a cat but they don’t listen.
So glad for you two
Lol I thought Chris was gay    ... my chances are ruined :(
If she's a leftwinger, dump her! If she voted for Turdeau, find someone else with brains!
I just came here to say "I KNEW IT!"
Awhhhhhh love you two!!! And I commented soooo long ago when I saw you two together to “please date “I saw the chemistry right away ! Letssss gooooo I win lol
About Time. I called this 2 years ago lol
Both you and Sharla were the first two YouTubers I started following. So I'm absolutely happy and excited for you two.
i look at the title of the vid and still didnt watch the video to its fullest but i think you dont have to justify or tell anyone why youre dating sharla i mean you knew each other for some time now and i think its great do what you wanna do wish you the best <3
I think I may have thought that these two could become a couple back when I watched Journey Across Japan. Didn't think they would years later and I was so happy for them. They both deserve to be happy, after all I believe that having someone special. Can really bring out the best in a person.
Congrats!  I felt you guys had nice on screen chemistry in your videos, and it's nice to know it's good offscreen.  Wishing the best for both of you!  Edit:  I also agree.  Date a friend.  My husband and I were friends first, and the relationship grew organically from that.  It makes such a good foundation to build a relationship on as well.  When the lovey dovey feelings go away, and you're just hanging out, you have that friendship to carry you through.
You say you've stopped being affected by her cats, but you do realise your face is swollen?
Re: cat allergies.  I have 3 cats and I’m totally fine with them.  However any other cat I immediately get itchy and get hives.. I have zero clue why am ok with my cats
Good for you, Chris!
Crazy how your channel helped me find Sharla and Joey. Now you're hanging with Felix. So cool all my fave youtubers are all friends. Congrats to you both<3 I always hoped you were together. In your old videos it always seemed like you had a big crush on her. Adorable 💜
Banff is nice but as someone who lives in Calgary, Banff is hugely overrated. It's crowded and crazy expensive. There are so many other gorgeous mountain and lake locations that are so much nicer. If you know a local there are lots of hidden places that are just as nice if not better.
Congratulations for you both...
You go so well together, I'm genuinely happy for you. Myself I will probably die alone....
I also had a cat since I was young and I created an allergy for cats while I had him, when he was around 7 years old my allergy was so bad. Now I got 2 cats on my own and I've never had any allergies towards them. But when I went to see them as kittens, I had bad allergic reactions. Seems like a very unpredictable allergy just like how cats are unpredictable.
Can't congratulate you both enough! Love this video, thanks for the talk and for the laugh about the Connor part, amazing 😂
HURRAY!! And here I thought Chris was going to die a lonely curmudgeon… Glad I was wrong!! 😅😄
Glad to hear things are going so well for you both! I liked you two together since her appearance on Journey Across Japan
Really happy for you both mate. I’ve followed you from the “too much face, green polo top” days and loved following your journey. Good luck to you man 👌👌
Of course you can't afford her apperance fee, she has cats to feed 🤣
Fuck yea good job guys lol
You look perfect together. Congratulations 💖
Aaaaawwwww!!! ❤❤❤
Good on ya son. Moves to Japan, creates an amazing YouTube channel and is in a relationship with a Canadian woman. The twists and turns of life...
2:05 😂😂 3:15 inchresting the cats dont really groom themselves then(?) since allergies are bc of their saliva & constant grooming 3:40 😳
congrats to you and charla. very nice, both of you are great.
Nice❤ Two amazing person together, so cool👏
So happy for you guys!
Name going forward: Sharbroad in Japan
Knew itttt
cheers chris!
So happy for you guys ^^ you both seem like amazing people and hope you'll be happy for a long time 😊
s2 happy for you both
That Pete impression was scarily accurate
I remember watching your shimanami Kaido video featuring Sharla and I thought to myself: „these two would go together pretty well!“ also I sensed Chris might be interested
i knew it!!!
Blessed be to you both.
I'm so happy for you both! Congratulations, from a fairly inebriated South Africa 🍾🥂
Omg I wish you two all the luck 🥰
Mad props and respect. Waitig to tell everyone was a smart idea. Hope you two live happily and sarcastically ever after.
Good lad, lucky boy!
This isn’t a huge surprise, but I’m happy for you nonetheless. I like both of you so the idea of you dating seems natural - like two friends of mine getting together. I suspect many people who watch your channels engage in a bit of “shipping” various people you interact with (not in a creepy way hopefully). I wish you all the best!
Good Lord, mate. Dating a Canadian? It must be absolute torment. Constantly apologizing. Never having a strong opinion on any issue. And that's only the primer....  Just utter torture.  Can't imagine how you're getting on.  RIP Chris.
Wholesomeee
Everything's in perfect harmony now
Dude, you shouldn't stop eating meat. But, you should focus on lean meats. Stay away from that fried chicken
I was thinking exactly that, the last video I saw of you guys!! Omgosh. 🥰 "Aren't they looking at eachother a different way these days?! 🤔 Hm,  maybe they should be dating eachother? Oh, well, I've probably got it all wrong." Me continues to watch casually unknowing. 😂😂😂👌🏼 Congrats guys! ❤️🥰❤️
Ryotaro should be your best man. He's your worst man, and that would make him your best man.
Even if I was gay I wouldn't date Connor.
That's good advice to date a friend, I may use it in the future
It feels more official than Sharlas announcement hearing you talk about Maro and Tuna.
Awesome! Big fan of both of you! Yeah a lot of times people will be allergic to cats at first then eventually they get used to it.
Healthcare
So happy for you both~ you're a great match and I watched you both independently and this are just the best news ♡ I kinda had the same reaction of joy when Sharla opened up about it. Really really happy for you!!
cuz she is cute and said yes...
Great Pete impression there.
I knew it from all those videos they did together on the bikes! Such good chemistry
Yay! So happy to hear your story. I also am a great advocate for dating someone you're friends with already. My husband and I were friends first, which is how we managed to negotiate a huge age difference (and are now somewhat infamous advocates for unconventional relationships). So in closing, I wish you and Sharla many more happy years of relationship friendship!
Yes, all allergies go away if you continue to expose yourself to the allergen... and as long as you don't die in the process.
I hope that Natsuki is okay with this
"A. S. O. / So much Volcano!", is my celebration/congrats song for this - the only song that comes to mind.   My husband and I have thought for a year that you two had some chemistry, so I'm glad I got that right.
How’s the sex
sometimes you get used to cat or dog allergy around specific animals if your with them for so long!
Hell yeah congrats chris and sharla, much happiness and love to you both
Its funny how Chris been to japan over 5 years and he not even get japanese girlfriend
viene una tormenta.....mark my words.
IT'S ABOUT TIME
You look very happy. It's great to see.
I had a feeling a while back you guys were getting a little close. Congrats Chris.
well there goes my chances
Chris punching well above his weight! 🤣
hmmm defo the love with Conner is real, happy for you but lets be real you and Conner are soul mates (sorry to the gf but you will be ok your stunning )
I always thought it was a inside joke between the community that Connor and Chris were dating but actually aren’t. But happy for  both of them.
I am so happy for the both of you!!! Now it's Connors turn 🤣
Oh the power of love, he's no longer allergic to cats!!!!!
Congrats Chris! Great looking couple. I think a lot of us had our suspicions that you two had been dating for a while now.
Well about fucking time! I knew you two were sweet on each other and I've just been shipping yall for the past couple yrs, congrats, I suppose?
As someone that is not interested in shipping Youtubers or famous people in general, Sharla's video made me both really happy and jump up, point at my screen yelling "I knew it!" Good times.  Wish you guys all the best. 10/10 best couple. ♡
Sharla seems like a sweetie - wish y'all the best!
Well Chris you have to admit, you and Connor have been to a lot of love hotels
We all knew this was coming
Congratulations Chris god speed for you and Sharla 😭😭😭🥳🥳🥳
I just assumed you always had been 🤣
Worst kept secret ever. It was apparent your chemistry on videos. Well mostly hers.
How long have you been dating? And when are we going to see a "date day" vlog? ♥
Chris dating Sharla ❎ Abroad in Japan dating Sharla in Japan✅
Love it. You make a great couple. I kinda had the feeling
Beware! The allergy returns if you spend enough time away from the cats, but it goes away again after enough time near them.
Ha, i knew it since the first video i saw you to together in!! You are a perfect match. I wish you all the best!
Chris! You gotta tell me, has Pewds recent video had a huge effect on your subscriber count? Big boost?
Cringe af.
Ohmygoodness! It’s about time!  The chemistry 😂 is favorable!Congratulations! 👏🏻 Happy for you both!
I think you two are a really good match not that it means much coming from a random YouTube watcher person, but you make her laugh and that’s the best thing in any relationship. Plus being both in the YouTube world for so long and okay being on camera for each other makes the whole content experience easier for us viewers in some way. Not that we need to see peoples partners but you know wha I mean
You look so happy Chris, love to see it!
Because they are humble and won't roast you asmuch ?
SO HAPPYYYYY++!
Congratulations, I wish you both the best.  Connor will be fine he's got a mouse to pester him.  lol
Love is much more powerful than cat allergy
I knew it i fucking knew it
You hang up on Natsuki to start a livestream? So he didn't outshine you?
Aww Chris is dating!
Congrats.See we knew something is going on. We just don't want to say it. CONGRATS
I thought you were gay
Just return to the last time Sharla visited Chris’ shop, and see the comments laughing how does Chris treat his friends (tries to kill them, more or less), and how he treats Sharla (buys her 7 course meal)
YAYYYYYYYYY BOND WELL AND GROW WELL TOGETHER!!
Update on Canada: The inflation is too high. Minimum wage qualifies for the first tax bracket. We have a duopoly for the internet industry and one of the companies had a nationwide blackout for a day about a month ago. Insurance costs an arm and a leg because that is also a shared monopoly.  Other then that everything is fine how is your country?  Edit: No one buys maple syrup in Canada. It’s just as expensive as it is abroad.
The dawg doesn't shower because you are not dating him Chris. I'm sure he would shower with you. ;p
I love it! You go to Japan to teach and live. Stay there for 10 years. Probably had plenty of dating chances with a Japanese woman. Still live there, and wound up dating a Canadian! Didn’t see that coming.
Well we'll Mr. Affable himself found a Mrs. Affable
I’m so happy you’re together. You have such great chemistry! Let me know if you and Sharla will be in Alberta/BC Canada for Banff. I will make the 3 hour drive to meet you both.
Canadian girls are the best! Just saying! But seriously I’m happy for you! ❤️ Even though I too thought you were gay. I think I got that idea because you referred to Connor as your partner in one video. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Awesome stuff big man. Happy for you both. Pair of legends 🙌
So Chris finaly hooked up? Congratulations. Now connor and kaho need to be a thing and everyone is happy 😁.
Chris is a very lucky man and definitely punching lol, very happy for you both and epic couple :)
I always had a feelng/ vibe that you 2 were together. All the very best to the two f you. Much love from london
Where can I get your light up visor.
congratulations on the relationship, Chris. Hope it goes well for you and Sharla!
Iv always loved you guys together in vids was always natural, this makes me happy and I hope both of you have an amazing life by each others side
IVE BEEN HOPING FOR THIS FOR YEARS I STG😭😭😭 literally just made my day holy shit congrats😂
Speaking from experience cat allergies do fade over time
Vancouverite here waiting for the day Chris touches Canadian grass. Congrats to you both!
I mean... it is at least better than someone from Wales.
I knew it!!!!!!!!!
I thought she married a Korean.
Esquimalt.....😏
Two of my fav utubers...I found her thru you, super happy for you both😁
Why does it matter, the country your SO, was born?
I had a crush on Connor but eww shower...or wait he baths....maybe just for the views...
Yassss
you need to recreate cycling across japan for both fun and losing weight 😀😃
When Sharla announced the relationship I was over the moon 😅🥰 I have been watching both of you for quite a long time and it made me so happy that you two are together ❤️ I married my best friend 17 years ago and still going strong. All the best to you both. Lots of love ❤️
Natsuki's sayings must rub off. I like "longest friend" way more than oldest friend. Quite a visual imagining a tremendously long, stretched out Natsuki towing over everything.
Happy for you mate, especially because I thought you weren't dating anybody there(in many videos you showed the hurdles to date a Japanese girl). I also get it you wanted to wait, personal drama and gossip is not the type of quality content we love to see here!
" Sharlas Cat " that's a quote
Chris, have you planked Sharla yet??
2:19 - It's okay Chris, we know Sharla is the girlfriend... But Connor is the boyfriend! 3:58 - For some reason that impression of Pete was... Quite accurate AHAHAHA! 5:40 - Ohhh Montréal? Did you know Montréal is one of the biggest food destination in the world? In NA it is only behind New York City if we go per capita! Huge variety of cuisines, very diverse! 6:43 - That is accurate - the data (statistics) say the same thing - longer lasting and better quality relationships/couples come from prior friendships/relationships between those individuals  Congratulations to you both - as many others, I always saw a very good synergy and chemistry between you two, so any form of relationship would work between you two! As friends or as lovers, it is great to see you together  It is quite a challenging territory to publicly share those details but I'm glad you both feel comfortable in letting everyone know - I just hope it won't become the MAIN topic of discussion from the comments ahahaha
Great new Chris.  I also met my wife in Japan.  So glad she's german in hindsight.  Communication is so much better.  And she's is a egg🥚
She moved to Sendai for you, knew it
Congratulations. I hope this goes well for both of you. The younger skinnier version of me that was living in Japan would definitely want to hang around Sharla to see if there could be more. 😆 Best wishes Mate.
#39 on YouTube trending. Congrats Chris!
Absolutely made up for you both Chris.  I have literally been waiting for this to happen for years....It was obviously gonna happen.  Your both flippin lovely and you deserve to be happy.  Also AbroadInJapan is the bees knees you big gay :)
As a transplanted Canadian in Texas, I give a two thumbs up on the dating Sharla for access to real maple syrup.  Finding out that you have family in Montreal is super cool. I'm originally from Montreal and just got back from a trip home for the first time in 6 years. I missed home so much, I'm looking to find work that will allow me to live there during the summer and down south in the winter. lolAgain, congratulations to you both. I have been a follower of you both for a long time and think you are both awesome humans.
Vancouver Island Resident here, check the place out if you have the chance! Banff is beautiful you wont feel far from home with the hot springs and amazing locals (try a van isle micro brew, im sure it'll be to your tastes!). I wish you two the best!
waha i guessed this a while ago from both of your body languages :D
I'm far from being a hardcore fan. I probably watch maybe 25% of your videos and 10% of Sharla's (although I'm subbed to both of you) but even I could tell you two were an item for a while now.  Worst kept secret ever.
For the visa?
chris looks happy
So.... Is your joint name Charla?
Her cats are hypoallergenic
About that cat allergy. Imma be honest, Chris, your voice in the video about ghosts in the Wacky Weekend video sounds A LOAD MORE nazal. It was close to listening to Zach Hadel. I dunno if you heard of the guy but he's voice is just ... blocked nose. Maybe I'm mistaking things. Take care, anyways, Chris
Chris isn't gay?   No hate, but I thought he was.
Love cures cat allergy.
Honestly didn’t expect this, thought you’d end up with a Japanese woman.
You might not be gay, but Connor is a cutie. Gotta respect that.
Doesn’t dating another Gaijin out you at a disadvantage?
Chris does Ryotaro know you are cheating on him?
YEEESSSSS!!
Oh i.....can't date my friend.....lol the thought of failing the relationship and losing a friend makes me afraid of relationship🥲
Yay! I knew it or at least I knew there'd be something eventually. Get on so well when you're on camera.
love your back drop bro!
I realized you two have chemistry during my quarantine period. 😂 Both of you entertained me while sulking alone in my room. Hahaha
I'm so glad for you and sharla🥺🥺🥺 oh and goodluck with your new challenge of eating healthier! It's gonna be tough but maybe it's gonna be more enjoyable now that you have sharla who i think is pretty knowledgable abt healthy diet!
So happy for you both! Also Chris, I'm allergic to cats too, but I used to work at an animal clinic. I noticed that the long-haired cats did not bother me and the short-haired cats made it hard for me to breathe. So I personally believe that long-haired cats are more tolerable, which is weird to think about... maybe since the cat dander is what we are most likely allergic to is from their skin, and so we come in contact with it more on the short-haired, while maybe the long-haired fur keeps it away from us better? Honestly I have no idea, but I noticed it rather quickly working with cats, so thats my theory. 😅
It's so weird hearing you say her name over and over again (her and I have the same name) There aren't many people with that name. I really like her content so this is really cool. Slightly jealous (just a teeny bit) because I've been harboring the "Chris Crush" for years...but it's awesome. Best Wishes to you both!
It was painfully obvious you and Conner weren’t dating. All the comments to the contrary are just the fanfic writers shipping you two 😆
Does YouTube have a “Sensible Award”? If so, you two both deserve one or maybe it is just a sticker that goes on that silver thingy. In Japan everyone wants to know your business. My crystal ball says good things are in store for two people in Japan that can keep such a happy secret. When I was in Japan, the same strategy worked for me - still married after 24 years. All the best.
White guy going to Asia and not dating the local woman must be one of the biggest plot twists in the world's lore.
The extent of the love people have for you guys is that this video currently ranks 39th in trending. Nearly all above you are big-name pop stars, sports events, influencers, etc. and giveaways. And I think that popularity is because you're both such genuinely nice people, humble despite your YouTube fame.
What's the difference between Chris Abroad and Abroad in Japan?
I'm so happy for you Chris, I remember wayyy back when talking about how dating in Japan isn't for you. I'm glad you found someone so great
Dude always knew it, you’re funny but not THAT funny and there Sharla was laughing at ALL your jokes in those Journey videos 😜 congrats guys wish you the best!
Very happy for you guys! 🙌
This really makes me happy Chris!!! Wishing all the best for the both of you.
Dressed as the Candyman, next year go as the child catcher from chitty chitty.
Great news. And a funny line to say you’re not dating Conor but no reason to tell us it was because you’re not gay. That killed the joke.   Hope all goes well for you.
I thought Chris and Conan was a thing saddest day of my life 🥺😭
Not showering was a bigger deal breaker than not being gay.
I'm glad that you have found happiness Chris.   You were meant to be MINE though my dear.
if Natsuki would be the best man, I think Ryotoro should be the worst man. they would get into an epic battle in the isle with Best Man eventually coming out on top!
haha, Because of your white privilege haha as a racist would say to answer your headline.
Congratulations!
If you're not ready to go all the way and date an American, a Canadian would be a good starter to shift that Overton window!
"I'm not gay" (wears a rainbow sparle glasses hairband...) 🤣🤣🤣 Just kidding, never even suspected you might be.  I'm alergic to cats, takes about 2 months to get aclimatized to a new cat, but you might need a mild alergy med if you're asthmatic.
Happy for you both, i love it when good people get together ❤️. Looking forward to future videos
It must be a blast to date Chris hahaha 😂 His sense of humour is impeccable :D Also, the impressions he makes of his friends, like Pete has me rolling on the floor always, hahahah 🤣
Very distracted by the fact that one camera angle is so sweaty
I'm so happy you used the Trash Taste reaction video 😂
this is chris' coming out video being not gay
"I don't know what goes on in Canada these days". Quite a lot actually and it is not good.
Called it since Journey across in Japan. Hope you both having a great time
Happy for you! That Pete impression was perfect!
From a fellow Canadian, the real question is why is Sharla dating one of the overlords????
my youtube parents 😭
You better say it's the best relationship you've ever had. Or she'll go Canadian goose on you & attack.
Firstly: Congrats Chris I always thought you two would be a great couple, and I'm glad you are testing the waters... Secondly: Connor seemed to be the most excited of the three of them for both of you Thirdly: Victoria is super nice, if you weren't going to Banff I would suggest Victoria, but since Sharla's from there I'm certain you'll see it soon enough Fourthly(?): I assumed Natsuki would be your best man... BUT if he is, he has to make a too much Volcano style rap about your wedding and you can't put Dr Jelly in the coat room!
Wow can't wait for them to get married in Japan and have babies.
Imagine being eaten out by a brit with a mouth like pitbull... innit
Geddon, though you gt along in that video you made ages ago :)
"Not that there's anything wrong with it!"
Wooohoooo!!! Congrats to you and Charla, glad things are going well for the 2 of you
The video's title-question needs answering in the comments! Why should one date a Canadian?  Jokes aside, I am so happy for you both and wish you all the best!! ♥Glad to hear your allergies work well with Sharla's fluffballs!
FYI, it's called desensitization. Allergy is basically a person's immune system reacting when it's not supposed to. So it does actually get better in case of mild allergy.
I would choose Natsuki as my maid of honor. Unless the bride can have a best man? LOLOL  Congrats to you & Sharla. ♥ Please pay the appearance fees so she can show up in more of your videos. hahahaha
So happy for you guys and I'm happy that you have found someone to love
Happy that Natsuki would be the best man but a bit surprised Ryotaro wasn't on that list. Please don't take this seriously
I always thought you should be dating, the chemistry was obvious. Good for you guys
congratulations Chris you got a hot and sweet girlfriend! I'm happy for you
So happy for you and Sharla, Chris! ☺️ You make a cute couple.
a broad in japan eh
I knew you were dating from the moment you did the cycling special, what girl enjoys to cycle that much with a friend??? 😅 Strangly enough
I really thought this was click-bait but still clicked just in case 😂😂
Aw. Right on. Best of luck to you both
Congratulations! I knew when you cycled on Journey across japan together that you 2 had a connection that went beyond friendship. Glad to see you 2 together👍
I've noticed that I have very bad allergic reactions to some cats and not others. You might've just gotten really lucky that sharla's cats fall in the latter category.
Alright man! About time that you getting some. Love your channel by the way.
So happy for the both of you!
I'm canadian
YYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! Okay, 'nuff said. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why does it matter who your dating, you don't matter, no one cares!
What will risottotoro do at your wedding then?
Lmfao. Totally see that. I thought years ago you guys were. Cute couple. Good luck guys!
Hear that? It’s the sound of fan fiction going into overdrive.
Cheers 🍻 to this amazing moment
I thought a certain hairdresser beginning with N might have been your guilty passion.  I hope you and Sharla are really good for each other. Joking aside, I am so happy for you both.  XXX
Well I would sincerely like to congratulate you on no longer being allergic to pussy.  With all the ...oh never mind. Welcome back to the team.  Sorry Connor and Canada.
Honestly I thought this was a bit, great to hear you’re in a happy relationship Chris!
WAIT What THE CONNER CHRIS WAS a bumbbozle all along
My husband and I were friends for about 6 months before we dated, and had a lot of mutual friends. Our 20 year anniversary is Monday, so I think it worked out!
Wait... I thought she was being sarcastic...
Congratulations. I hope the best for both of you, I know how hard it is to show a relationship in such a public platform.
Connor has mouse wtf
Break my heart 💔 but happy for you both too. I must let you go 💖 Hope you're getting married soon, and have cute babies 💖🥰💖 Maybe Connor can try me then 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘 So the plan is:  1. More vlog together  💝 2. Getting married and have cute babies 👶 3. Make new channel with wife and kids 😎👍 4. Build a dream house with garden inside and studio for filming new chapter in your life. 5. More product and business coming soon 🙏
I remember you mentioning seeing a girl eating a piece of bread. That was Sharla.
The actual fuck I thought it was a joke!! WOW CONGRATS <3 CRAZY <3 <3
Sharla is high key top shelf Wifu. And I'm jealous but I've been shipping you two for years.
Congrats man! Truly! So happy for you both! Talking about the cats, they have quite the long coat, so they may be Siberian, those cats are actually one of the few that produces less of whatever triggers cat allergies, funnily is not the hair
Honestly kind of figured as much. Really isn't anyone's place to pry though... although this is the internet, so people obviously will. I hope the two of you are really happy together, and remain really happy together. Congratulations, you two :D
Good lad, it's about bloody time we brought them back into the empirical fold.
Haha awesome! I always saw a chemistry there. Also you got family in Montreal? That's awesome! Shout out from MTL 👌 love the channel, great news and would be awesome to bump into you. Just don't steal our syrup 😂
Now I might have the chance to annoy you on the street if you visit her hometown at some point in the future.
Bisexuality exists, Chris. Liking guys doesn't automatically make you gay somehow 🙄
That’s good news. I always hoped you’s two would get together.
Woooo Vancouver is mentioned 🙌
Maybe I’m biased but I love 🇨🇦 (I live here) we’re currently dealing with some whiny pricks intent on ruining the rest of our days. No, not the Americans this time. Some nice homegrown idiots. But we’ll pull through in time for the next olympics I’m sure
So happy for you man! I had a feeling you guys were keeping it quiet for a while now! I dunno your chemistry together was just like a perfect couple 😂 Been watching you since your very first video, it's great to know you have someone special with you here in Japan! Also...you guys allllways seemed to mysteriously go for trips to the same places around the same times 🤣🤣 Thanks for all your amazing content over the years! (p.s. hope you guys are staying safe with all the flooding happening around Yamagata atm!)
🤣🤣truly they thought you were gay how common could this thought be
My sister actually told me (this was months ago) that you're dating Connor. She really believed that 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need a link to that sweet headband. 🥺
“Date a friend” -bold of you to assume I can make friends lmao
Saw this coming a mile away!
Congrats on having a date now! Better prepare to answer questions about this video.. ;)
This is so cute. Wish all the best to you all.
I can't concentrate what does Chris have on his head? I can't decide if I dislike it or want one.
About time Chris!!
I felt a connection between you two ever since the first Journey AJ. Although you weren't dating at the time, you both had a very pulling like energy that was so fun to watch ! Looking forward to new adventures!
The candy man sounds like a right proper nonce 💀😭
Bro Connor x Ironmouse break up xD
You can develop an immunity to a certain animals dander (in this case, cats) the more time you spend with them! You can also get a shot that helps with your allergy and can even get rid of it if your immune system adapts to it. Glad you two are together and you love the kitties ; Q ; ) <3
Congratulations
Congrats to you both! Love you both!!
My wife called it a LONG time ago
Oh dude, we all knew waaayyy before you did.
Congrats Chris you're blessed 👍
❤️
I remember watching your Video Chris, where you and Sharla were doing a Japanese only Challenge. And I remember saying to myself; "Wow, they make a good couple. They've known each other way before Chris was popular." (referring to Sharla's Blog where Chris was holding the Camera)  I don't know if you'll be able to see this Chris nor Care but We're Happy for you guys. Keep on being yourself and have a Bountiful Nature.
Official announcement is a commitment normally people necessarily don't have to do.  It might have been burdensome to you to decide pubilicising this video. Having said that, I really appreciate you dating her and just being happy.
You know you have good friends when they react like that. Happy for you both.
OK nosy people your curiosity is satisfied. Leave them alone.
If only all couples were this perfectly matched, the world would be a better place🙏❤️☀️ Much love to you both! XOXO
My husband and I were friends before getting into a relationship. We were friends for 3 yrs. Started dating. Got engaged. Got married. Now we have been married for 8 yrs and have 2 kids together
You have a great American accent. Also, yay!!!!
So happy for you and Sharla! 🙂
British Empire returns 🇬🇧🤝🇨🇦
You've given 1000s of people deep in the friendzone false hope 😂
I think you can build up a certain immunity to individual cats, but you are probably still allergic to other cats, so please take care.
Interesting, when i moved back home from uni i was bunged up around the cat for a month but then it went away
Yes, Chris isn't gay. That doesn't stop him from sleeping with Connor every chance he gets, though. Just never in the same bed, although I can't be totally sure about that.
It’s about time, honestly
You definitely hate cats and lied about the allergy 😭 glad you’re happy though boss 😂
Glad you finally came out as a straight guy! Congrats to you and your gf, she’s lovely!
Wow this is literally the sweetest thing
@Chris Abroad I didn’t think that @CDawgVA was gay. Actually, I thought he was dating Shibuya Kaho. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Obligatory I feel bad for Connor comment 🤣
I.am.heartbroken.
If I ignore the facts in front of me long enough they will disappear and Connor will take his rightful place by Chris's side :Ddd
@Chris Abroad Well, it’s personal, thus it’s none of anyone’s business!
Cat and dog allergies can get better when you are exposed to them, but also race of the dog or cat plays a huge role, if you brush your cats and dogs they can shed less which also helps.  So allergy medicine, choose the right race and or brush them everyday, and you'll be mostly fine :) I do have cat and dog allergies but my sisters cats has never bugged me somehow, but my bf family dog will make my eyes scratch after 4 hours... But i do also stick my face in her fur so....
I thought you guys been dating for years 😆
Is "Canadian" Connor's full name?
I think your diet is working very well. You already seem much more fit than before.
I watched that Q&A, and I honestly thought she was joking. I thought it was like, 'I'll tolerate you shipping me with Chris if it throws you off the scent and makes you stop asking questions about my actual boyfriend.'  I still think this may be an elaborate ruse.
Kept waiting for a punchline... glad it never came 😁
Nice! I like it how two fats are dating, you guys are meant for each other!
Nothing but right when you date someone you've been good friends with for at least a year. My Fiancé and I jumped into a relationship the instant we met, lasted for a haggard 6ish months, he dumped me. We remained friends for 4 years and both grew as people and we actually got to know each other and see what we both had to offer. Long story short, started dating again at the tail end of 2021 and are engaged now. Best relationship I've ever had.   Good luck to you and Sharla!! 🙂
This is so sweet, I'm so happy for you ^^
Congrats you two, hope you both have a great time :) And good on you for not rushing about saying anything.
Nah it’s ruined I saw a great friendship now I can I just can’t 😞
Hey Chris. Great news! I love the fact that this video, as of the writing of this comment, is #17 on trending on Youtube.
Gz to you both!
Omg my husband and I always wondered if you guys were dating. Ahhhh 😍
There definitely were a couple of videos which made it seem like Connor was your boyfriend. I never thought you were gay but it was one of those oh okay, cool moments.
love❤️
We are so happy for ya'll !!!!!! Cute couple for sure.
This made it on trending nice xD
Welp there goes my dream of becoming Mr. In Japan
The "I'm Not Gay" should be a meme hahah. Congrats to you guys!
Lmao that Pete impression is so good
You don't need to be so emphatic that you're not gay. That's a very hetero thing to do. Like, it was implicit in you dating a chick.
God Natsuki was flexing on chris too much
Chris : *Announces JAJ S2* Viewers :" I sleep "  Chris (Again) : *Confirms Dating Allegations* Viewers : *MONKE AWAKE*
So happy for you and Charlotte but don't forget to take cdog aka Connor for a walk 🤣🤣🤣
This is the best thing Ive seen in a while. XO Happiness to you both!
omg that American accent killed me
He isnt gay, he is british. They all sound like that.
Maybe she can stop you from fat
1:41 he became a Simp
What amazing friends! Everyone is genuinely happy for Chris and Sharla.
Congratulation to both of you!!!!
I love that the relationship is having a positive change   He's getting over the cat allergy  And he's improving his diet
Wait wasn’t she just joking ?
LLLEEEETTTSSS GOOOOOO OUR BOI ONLY WENT AMD DID IT!.....congrats fam😗♥️
Oh, i thougt you are gay. I‘m happy for you two and i hope you have a good time. Dont get me wrong, but i thougt someday there will be a reveal video about you and Natsuki. 😜
Well done my dude. Well done, congrats
Yes!!! I’ve been shipping you guys for so long!!
What on earth gave some alphabet types the idea that you were one of them ? You have pretty much the same attitude as Jeremy Clarkson.
🥳🥳 Happy for you two! Relationship goals: full and unlimited access to maple syrup and fish n chips.
While I like the idea of dating a long-time friend, I’m old enough now that any dating I do is going to be with marriage in mind. I also believe that a successful relationship/marriage depends on sharing core values. Values come first, then interests. Interests can change quickly, but values can take a lot longer.
Pfft! He just wanted free access to maple syrup.
What’s also nice about your relationship is that you can put on a convincing Canadian accent. 😉  Well, I’m sure that _must_ come in handy somehow. 😂
I'm also from Victoria BC. Born and raise in James Bay. Now living in Osaka. I wish you both the best.❤
When people gets angry over these stupid meme jokes they do it because they know some people are dumb enough to believe it's real
YAY! ❤ Congratulation to the both of you! I always felt chemistry watching videos of you together!
You guys are made for each other
The snarky Brit is Actually BLUSHING in this video! 😁😊 👏 Cheers mate 👍
I thought chris might be dating a Japanese girl lol. But maybe they are just afraid of white guy 😂
What about your boy friend Connor when you're Tungsten Rat? Congratulation on your new love by the way!
Really? You're way too old for her.
Man that one guy who commented about how jealous he was of you meeting Sharla all those years ago must be turning green with envy at this point.  Congratulations, and I hope its a long and happy relationship for you two.
YES! FINALLY! Been Praying Sharmander and You would date since many years ago! You make the cutest couple and looking forward to the marriage and little 'Chrislas' running around! 😃😁👏 You may want to avoid Canada though.. the dictatorship government has gone quite mad lately.. lol.. Very nice to visit though, preferably in Summer 😎
Knew it
The way you actually blushed at the start of the video when you confirmed it is just too adorable
Chris, you are not gay. You are just Connorsexual.  .....   I am sorry I am cringing from myself as well
It has to be for The maple syrup. She got to have The Good stuff, she's from Canada...
Aren’t you supposed to be dating a Welsh Man!?
Ahhhhhh ❤️💃🏻🫶🏻🙌🏽 yesssss I had this feeling years ago when I saw you guys in early day vids!!!! This is amazing I always hoped you guys would get together! X
I had a friend in university who I had a lot in common with and we drifted apart. We were both in different relationships at that time (2012). Two years later we were both single and had our first date. Instant love. Married in 2018, had our first child together 2021. Best advise you can give Chris. Being friends with your partner makes the relationship so easy and you truly enjoy each others company all the time. Congrats you two. Been following and shipping you for years. Screamed so loud with joy when Sharla announced it. ❤❤❤
She's trouble.  You're all doomed.
Happy for you both ☺️
Is that a real reaction with Joey Connor and Garnt?
Loved this stream
Great to see our favorite YouTubers dating.   Happy for you.   Cheers.
Does Risottoro know?
Hey Chris you selling that thrust master throttle.. if so I’ll happily take it off your hands..
the premiertwo impression was literally perfect lmao
Congrats and good luck to both of you!
Honestly so funny that so many people thought Chris was gay. 😂
Congrats bro :D
cutting down on meat does not mean healthier. lean meat is good for you. eat more whole foods, cook more, reduce junk food, take out and highly processed stuff
it was the valentines day chocolate wasn't it? Wish you all the best
I don't know who decided that meat is not healthy choice. U need to eat it every single day. But don't put oil on the meat  then says vegan is better choice. U have to eat different food.
I'm very happy for you guys. I wish you all the best 😉👍🏻
Good for you mate. Wish ya all the best. And yes some allergies can lessen or go away
@Chris Abroad Whaaat you used our question to you from our stay at NEKO NEKO INN!‽ Thank you!   Congratulations on surviving 6 weeks of cat allergies to become besties with Maro! Hopefully Tuna will become a well-adjusted affable teenage cat under your tutelage!   NEKO NEKO INN was incredible! Sharla and Ushka did an amazing job renovating it! The Kombini art made us think of you in a “kombini chicken” kind of way!  Fami-chiki is our favourite too!
Had a feeling based on some of the vids I saw on both channels over the last few years. Y’all are beautiful. I hope it’s a bloody f***in fairytale, and that’s no joke. Well done to you both
It's obvious that Chris and Connor are not gay, although it's true Connor can be confusing sometimes because of his videos 😆 But i think people just loved to pair you two because "bromance" if you know what i mean 😉 i don't think anyone was serious about that. I'm so happy for you and Sharla 💓 2 awesome people together is always nice to see 👍
Hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh
I'm reminded of Joey and Aki having to dance around their audience for a while when they started dating until they just ripped off the bandaid.
Because it’s been a bad community joke for so long, I honestly don’t believe you lol
Not surprised at all. Always knew they had some chemistry going on. Since years ago. I just always thought they kept it secret.😂
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I KNEW IT MY MAN.
Im so happy for you guys two awsome people together
I will be honest, I couldn't take Chris seriously at the start of the video due to his hairband(?) flashing and making me lose focus.  Regardless, I liked the decision they took and reveal this information after settling.
we 'GAY've off those vibes'
Wow, I can't believe it's already been 5 years... I discovered you through Sharla, and I still remember the move to South Korea. She was my first vlogger and just really made me feel as close to Japan as I'll ever know. You were a guest once and seemed cool. And of course the accent won me over instantly. I'm so happy for you both. You two are super cute together and both seem much happier. And it's great she's inspired you to change your diet a bit. I hope you'll be around a long time. You bring much joy to your viewers and are a true source of good in this world. Thank you for everything.  🍻  Wishing you both good health and great success. Live long and prosper. 🖖🤍💜
Great news! I always thought with all the travel experiences they've shared and the way they easily bounce off eachother, surely these 2 have to get together!!! I'm glad it's happened because it shows attraction and relationships can be built on friendship. I've only ever dated people who have been attracted to me off the bat which ultimately doesnt work long term and never managed to turn a friendship into something more. So I am actually jealous in that respect ha. But I think these 2 are basically made for eachother and I hope it goes well
Great ❤️❤️❤️
Keeping it within the Commonwealth, very politically suave move.
To be honest  I thought you were gay .....   🤔
All the best guys. Those lonely nights with Dr Jelly are over!
Go to Jasper instead of Banff. Just as picturesque but faaar less busy/touristy
I always thought you two would be cute whenever I'd saw both of you in a video 💖 so happy for the both of you
Good for you mate and I think it was good to keep it undercover for some time.
I'm not sure if this is appropriate but congratulations on the relationship.
Congrats Chris! The best of luck for both of you
Yooo! Chris, cosplayed as candy man. The candy man was known for killing his children (two boys, I believe), and later claiming their life insurance money. This happened in the city of Houston, Texas (no shocker there) during Halloween.
the outro is a banger, where can I find it?
Baton Rouge Louisiana, Dumb Shxt 70805 #illahville #https://youtu.be/PyPjRe2OR1w 💯
I wish you best of luck. Cheers
poor ryoutaro lol
I never thought Chris was gay, how ludicrous, my gf did though, she's very upset
Happy for you! I think it will make fir better content, can we see what ‘partners’ do in Japan? Like how the Japanese do romantic stuff in their own quirky weird way? Love hotels 😂  P.s You are actually allergic to cats saliva, as they wash themselves its on their fur, try not to touch them immediately after they washed, give it a while.
at that sharla is already in a relationship?
Ah yes this weird "dating" concept, observed in North America and aparently .. Canada ? Where you go out together , don't do the regular rtyings you'd do with your regular friends.. then after doing a it a few times sex is expected.. Then there's some kind of evaluation and deliberation period , all the while you can be "dating" other people ???   This happens nowhere else tbh.
It's obvious Chris isn't gay... although that 'American accent ' video might have confused some people. 😏
Congratulations... on your relationship change and I am sure it would work out great... I knew this was going to happen since journey across japan cycle... more precisely the convenient store episode where she fed you nato and she drank from the same can from you... it's just a movie/anime trope but it showed how comfortable the both of you were with the chemistry you developed... I hope to see more collaborations with the two of you...
Congratulations
Chris one thing as a Canadian man I can say just keep feeding her properly and everything will be awesome
You do know that one meaning for the candy man is a durg dealer.
Holy shit that P2 impression was spot on! I had to look back at the video to confirm it wasn't actually him. Happy for you and Sharla mate!
Wait, this is real?
So happy for you guys!  Wishing you all the best!
I relate to being allergic to cats but slowly building immunity. I used to sneeze whenever a cat was in vicinity, I have 6 cats now lol
1:28  , it is like with pregnancy: you wait the first three month before you involve your suroundings 😂😉👍
Sorry but I thought  until this video that Chris X Sharla was a meme, even the first seconds into the video. I was a bit surprised when Chris confirmed it as the "shipping guys" are usually wrong.  Not that I particulary care, it's just something that was in the background since forever.
Mad proud of you, brohemian. I’ve always sensed the possibility between you two on camera. I wish you two the very best. Lots of volcano🌋
Make sure you kick a ball at her, Chris. See if she's a keeper.
Never knew you had a thing for bread eating jvloggers
Good for you champ.  I remember when you spoke about how much you hate the classic life, getting married, having kids, getting credit, buying that dream house and work the 9 to 5 job, like a slave, to pay the mortgage.  Glad you found the one and only.
*I* would be offended if Natsuki isn't gonna be the bestman
We need more friends like Connor.  His reaction lol.  A true mate there.
Well done for u both congratulations
Will you now buy a traditional japanese house and renovate it? It's the thing to do :P
10/10, IGN, would date again. That is a line I hope to be able to use sometime as well.
If the internet says you're gay: U Gay 😆
LOL the intro is hilarious.. NGL tho I've had my suspicions about you and Sharla for some time now.  ;)
It's new to see you smiling so much in this video. And not cynically too! Congratulations 🎊
I'm so happy for Chris and Sharla❤... Also kinda nice seeing this more wholesome side to Chris too❤
Cat allergies usually come from the Dander in their food which can be managed with diet but all allergies can come and go
Hey Chris, old videos featuring you and Sharla are suddenly all over my front page.  Have you noticed the views of those videos suddenly expoding?
connor pain is that his r/s is either platonic with kaho or long distance with a vtuber.  there's different kind of allergies some are deadly(these dont go away most of time)  some are just mild either from lack of exposure  or its just not a serious bodily response.  i had an allergy to grass when i was young... like my legs would have rashes when i walk through grass( i had to wear long socks to reduce the rashes) it became non-existent after secondary/junior high.  either way keep anti-histamines on hand if you might encounter your allergies and an epipen just in case you have serious allergic reactions
I still don't know if this is satire or not...
I just assumed you guys were dating ages ago. Congrats! And nice save on 'the best relationship i've ever had' comment lol
I knew it, for awhile too.
You're soooo cute together!! Mostly because of Sharla though😆   (jk, after all, you're the affable man)  Btw, Sharla's costume is awesome in that Halloween picture 🤩
Dude! Congrats! You’re both awesome! 👍🏻 never seen a relationship that’s not my own make me so happy!
A really big evolution of Chris, proud of you man you've come far
Better get that chicken and broccoli diet out chris
Mr and Mrs In Japan
Fat Chris has a girlfriend,  wow we all got a hope now. 😊  Thank you Chris 😁😉
I like how he loves that video edit it's so sweet
Omg!
*leans closer to the microphone*  Called it
"I'm not gay! I'm not gay!" he says, wearing that thing in his hair blinking in rainbow colours 😂 Jokes aside, I'm happy for the both of you and wish you the best!
Good luck with your relationship!
You're so cute I love you
I also have a cat allergy and had a cat growing up. Now i have my own cat and i still have to wash my hands and her beds and stuff, but mostly it's really okay with my allergy (exept for when she has her hair change)
Love cured his allergies and I can't believe people actually fell for the Connor and Chris dating meme
I could remember when he was pissed about Sharla in Japan YouTube channel haha
I KNEW IT. THERE IS CHEMISTRY EVEN BEFORE OMG IM RIGHT IM SO EXCITED
Happy for you guys!
Chris, how on earth does Sharla date you after you put her through the hell of her life on that roller coaster some years ago. It's beyond amazing she ever forgave you that! 🤣
Yes you are gay Chris. Everyone is bisexual, some people are just shy
I still think Dave pulled a fast one on everyone and is actually dating Sharla.
So u didn't move to Japan to date an anime waifu?? Then what did u even move to Japan for????!! 🤨
Congratulations! :)
thank you God classic chris btw 1:37
Tbh, I’m not surprised that you guess were dating. I remember you were always sweet to her when you popped up on her videos. Glad you guys are officially dating. 😄
Happy for you both 💕🌼🌺🌹🎉👍
The candy man was serie killer in the USA. There you go Chris, great costume.
Just like a Brit. Goes overseas to conquer whatever they can.
Ohhh, that's where I've been going wrong... I guess I need to make some friends...
So happy for you Chris. Absolutely love your channel and so proud to see you getting healthy again and finding someone. Wishing you all the best !!
Lol @ "what's Connor gonna do?" Hahahaha
To this day one of my favorite youtube videos is the rollercoaster ride with "FU out of 10"
Couldn’t be me
The vid shows trending #20. I've never seen that before.
im happy for you my dude :D i have been subbed to sharla for as long as i can remember and shes such a nice person and so are you so happy for you both
So No more love  hotels  with Connor them 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
gratz cuties :3
Shouldn’t the title be, “Why is a Canadian dating me?” Canadians are generally nice people, much nicer than the rest of us.
Congrats.
I kinda noticed it, since everytime u appears in Sharla's videos..I somehow caught you have a blushing awkward face all the time 🤣🤣 Congrats tho! Happy for both of you
can't say anything but congratulation
Fek, even i scream. Almost like Connor :D  Best for you two. O God. My two favorite Japan YouTubers. YES. You made it Chris.
She’s out of your league. Don’t mess this up!
IT WAS FATE
AYYYYY
I promise never to attempt a British accent if you never attempt an American accent again.
Great news Chris. I'm a big fan of both yourself and Sharla and hope this is the beginning of a long happy life together. Just remember to keep parts of it for yourselves. Don't share everything with us!!
Well duh, I'm glad you didn't talk about it. Congrats you silly sod.
I thought he was gay and dating Connor!
All the trash taste crew being ecstatic that the next wedding they're attending probably won't involve 20-hour flights and 50k of gear vanishing.
Chris, so you are not gay? 🤡
Hey if i learned anything from Scrubs it's that bromances are totally its own thing from relationships. Be nice to Connor :D
I remember a few months ago I commented on one of your videos that featured Sharla saying something like "thumbs up if you think Cris and Sharla would make a great couple". I’m glad my comment manifested this into reality for you guys and as I’m obviously to thank for the relationship coming to fruition I expect an invitation to the inevitable wedding 😁
I thought us that follow yall caught onto this a while ago lol I love yall together 😍😍😍
Not gonna lie, was one of the people that assumed Chris was gay and dating Connor.
Japan YouTubers cinematic universe is becoming reality lol
Agree, can’t date anyone who doesn’t shower.
It was pretty obvious for a long while. The bennifer of YouTube.
Can't wait for the having-babies-in-Japan video
Is that a headband? I dig it though. Congrats!
We're about to get Twobroads in Japan
That's great....hope all the best. Wish you two; great health, happiness and great fortune.
Chris and Sharla....still waiting for Connor and Mousy
When he's with conor he acts gayish. No wonder people thought he's shagging conor
i thought it was a joke
I never got the impression that Chris was gay. Just that peoplw in Japan seem more comfortable being in like.. baths and stuff with other guys. Conner on the other hand..  But yeah, Chris just never seemed like a sexual guy but I'd imagine that's because he doesn't wanna put that side of himself on a public YouTube channel lol  Good show though Chris, knew it'd be a good choice after seeing her beat Joey at wanker soba. Cheers for you both!
Good for you mate. On another note, all this talk about Canadian visas makes me wonder: do you have Japanese citizenship now? How does that work for foreigners becoming permanent residents there?
Awww…(a genuine aw)
Oooh #10 in trending in Canada at least on my end! Congrats on the relationship and cheers 🥂
Why is sharla covering for your sexuality?
"I'm not gay, I'm just British!"
Yes!!! Congratulation’s, you guys 🫶🏼 Always had a feeling there was more to your relationship 😏
Chris is the only man to have overcome the friend-zone.
No one saw that coming /s
Trudeau is my role model and hero
Sharla wacky weekend when? 🤔
As a Canadian, and also being from Alberta. You have to check out Banff, or Jasper.   Along with traveling through the mountains from Alberta to BC. 10/10
Tell Connor I'm on my way
Happy for you guys☺️
Nice to see you two together. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats, you two! Could not stop Smiling watching this announcement.
All those videos of them riding bikes together and speaking Japanese for a whole day and no one knew? 😂
There is a GOD!
you two make a great sweet couple!
Isn't Chris old enough to be her father?
Number 10 on trending haha !
Dude, we saw this coming years ago. Mazel Tov.
Mazel tov you two cutie pies!
"Tune the fucking kitten" hear hear
I think that the bois already knew about their relationship.
good video. glad you found your other half. good advice too at the end
Let's gooooo! This is the second Chris and sharla relationship I know (used to joke with my bf about it since I don't know many chris and sharlas and they're all matched up lol
I never expected you both to date😳 Nonetheless you guys have known each other for a while and I’m glad it turned out this way. Happy for you both
What do you think about Sharla's cat Tuna 👁👁
Chris we been knew y’all are so obviously in love
Happy for you guys. I did wonder for a while. On the topic of cat allergies - this happened to me too. I gained an allergy out of no where to cats (despite owning them for years) and it went away over time.
It is sooo weird seeing Chris be genuinely happy. It's good for a change. Never lose your British cynicism, however! #Charla5ever
I was team Chris x Conner lolol
Sharla is HOT AF!!! Well done Great Britain. WE'RE TAKING OVER CANADA!!! LOAD THE SHIPS!!
I remember watching the first video with both of you in and thinking ‘there is definitely a vibe there’. Congrats guys!
It’s cause them Japanese ain’t easy to date;)
OH HECK YESSSSS!!! FINALLY!!!
Congratulations to the both of you!! I was so happy when I found out you were dating!
I'm happy for you! <3
I met my person over ten years ago and we’ve been married for five years so yeah I agree dating a good friend is great lol
I knew it and I'm so happy
Because you failed as a white man living in japan to land a Japanese woman🤣
i knew it
My wife kept saying this every time she turned up in a video recently. As a Brit married to a Canadian in canada...you don't get privileges haha, least not in BC. There is only so much maple syrup...
Haha, your Pete accent is amazing! Spot on
Good luck mate
I knew it!
Trending? Ok I see you my man lol
Chris being optimistic 🥴🥴🥴
Kinda saw this coming tbh.  Congrats guys!
Honestly, I had a hunch about you two. Good thing I was right lmao. I wish you every happiness and a most affable relationship! ❤
Day sucks. Watch this video. Life is beautiful again.
As someone who can’t do more than subscribe or like your videos, I’m really glad you have a Sharla.
Wait , its Sharla, not Norm now i'm confused 😂
I knew it. Felt something was cooking when they were collabing in biking across Japan videos, and then definitely later videos.
I was expecting more some kind of press conference with Chris's friends as the journalist. That is million view content right there!
Now that the secret is out, I'm looking forward to see more videos with you two, you both are adorable together and entertaining to watch!
Sharla Abroad :)
4:00 the impression of Pete was so accurate 🤣
Was quite obvious.
Chris’ Pete impression is the highlight of this video 😂
I’d always just assumed Chris was gay — going to hotels with men… etc
I legit assumed this was a joke.
Chris really is living the dream huh
Hands off our precious maple syrup reserves, you foreigner! 😂🤣😂🇨🇦🍁
So step one is getting a Friend
My husband and I have had a running bet over the last six months on whether Chris was dating Connor (his vote) or Sharla (HA HA I was right 😅)! Congratulations to you both on your happiness, and thanks for the win! 😄
Sharla is now Mrs.Affable...wish you guys many love and positive energy ❤️
Great news! Well done.
As a native Albertan I will say this, Banff is awesome, but I find it's sooo touristy, you definitely should check out the Hot Springs and Louise, but I've worked in Canmore for the better part of 3 years and can whole heartedly recommend it over Banff. There isnt as much happening but it has one of the most stellar mountain views in the 3 sisters and it has some awesome hikes. Banff isnt that far away so you can definitely visit both but canmore also is cheaper overall. A better bang for your buck
Dude awesome news congrats to you two 👏
you may be affable, but she is Canadian nice.  There is nice, then there is Canadian nice and that's a whole new level of friendly/nice!
When people are allergic to cats it''s not the cat hair that they're allergic to, it's the cat saliva. If Sharla gives the cats a wash regularly it should help and don't let them lick your face.
It's cool you dating her congratulations
Wait I thought you was gay?  The small comments and hints about gay bars lol
I think it’s weird that people kept asking, but now that it’s out there, happy for you both.
That impression of Pete was as close to spot on as you can get
My husband and I were together for 11 years before we finally got married, so I can attest to the date a friend advice~
So you guys have been together since she got on a bike and pedaled with you across Japan? She was a keeper then for sure 🤍
Get it my boy
"Connor doesn't shower"  So Chris, you  feel sorry for this cry baby? Idk why you or Joey etc ever hang with this guy.
WHOA I NEVER KNEW??! CONGRATS TO YOU TWO UWAAAA
Yes, I want to see Chris in more of Sharla's daily vlogs! As her channel is chilled, slice of life. However I'm glad you said your videos aren't really going to change (love you're in relationship together but if your channel became just a lovey dovey couple channel then it would definitely lose its charm and be like a lot of other YouTube channels out there!) I want to see that miserable persona 😅
I FUCKIN KNEW IT!!
This was sooo obvious to me!!! Congrats! Happy to hear it has been a great relationship
I always figured you guys were…the chemistry was always there. Happy for you guys <3
Chris - I've thought to myself how difficult it must be for you to collaborate vlogs with someone as attractive as Sharla. The thought had to have crossed your mind the hope she felt the same way. So seeing this news makes me so happy for the both of you! She's a stunner. Well done mate! 👏
No Chris: VEGAN IS MURDER
I cant believe it. I always thought it would be Chris and Joey
Your Pete impression is spot on LMAO
21 on trending???
The thing I really care about in this video is learning what this guy is wearing on his head.
Meetup in vancouver chris!! Ill be waiting :)
That’s the wild thing about cats! You kind of build an immunity to them if you’re around them enough! For me it only works with my own cat, others still get me a lot quicker and defo itchier. But for some reason my cat only gives me mild allergies!
I'm loving this. Best wishes to you both. I followed Sharla way before I found you. lol
Let's fucking gooooooo
I can't tell if this I long joke between the two of them but good for them
YAAAAAASSSSSS!!!!! <3
I agree with dating someone you are friends with! I have been friends with my husband since 2001.. we started dating in 2010!  We are Married with 2 kids now!! 10/10 do recommend! I did ship you and Sharla for a long time, you both have similar energy! Very Happy for the both of you.
Adorable cats good for her
Yup, cat allergies can go away with time, as your body gets used to dander. Same happened with my sister.
I have been watching Sharla for the last 4 or 5 years (Literally just about every video) and was so chuffed at this announcement! Congrats to you both!
Are these the actual reactions of the guys seeing the video??? or are they just placed there as an edit? hahahaha
🥺 kawaii
I love how this video got on the trending page. Among all the Minecraft and music, a 14 minute clip of a livestream about a relationship update. I doubt Chris intended the publicity, but congrats nonetheless!
THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN YOU TWO WAS ALWAYS DIFF!!!! SO EASY HAHA
#25 on trending !
Cat allergies are caused by the cats dander, it is possible to get over the allergies of specific cats but it is believed that the dander reflects the diet and cleanliness of the cat. Hope you the best
その方が賢いと思う!デート頑張れ〜💝㊗🏩
Your bros be celebrating for you lol!
Y'all Chris and Connor aren't gay they're just British, jeeze.
You are the last person I would guess gay
"Would date again" lmao Great to hear the news. Congrats!  Great American accent too btw
If you have a kid will his channel by inheritance would be Abroad in Japan
Congrats mate! Now stop mucking about and marry her, have some kids and enjoy life. Don’t waste anymore time. Life’s to short!
As along term viewer of both of your channels in beyond happy for your two! Wish you all the best
Expected as much when Sharla moved. Good luck with it all.
I usually hate couples but you two are on the likable list 👌🤣 happy for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chris Abroad, more like Chris welcome aboard he's done it
Congratulations you two!!! Super happy for you both.
Your not gay? Wow. Chris. Stop this Charade. Your gay. It’s cool. It’s ok. Journey across Japan is freaking Awesome.
I knew it, Connor fully embraced monkey. Not showering is the way of the future
Connor needs to be the flower girl for the wedding!
Man finally!!!!! Ever since the journey across japan I thought I woukd love for you two to get together hahaha... wish you the best guys
Yay!!❤❤❤
Chris played the long game
Now that you're dating a Canadian, can you now fix your bitrate?
Okay but like I'm so excited and happy for you I've been watching you for years and actually just started watching her a couple months ago and now this omg that's so cool 🥰❤ I'm happy for you guys and I love you both
Prepare to have lots of maple syrup around the house, eh?
“I’m not gay personally”
Chris's coming out as straight moment. That took guts mate.
FINALLYYYYYYYYY
Congratulations and please take care of her 🙏 I'm single, so do you guys have any plans to torture us and create dating content in Japan? 🤣 *can't wait tho
Congratulations 🥳
Wow. So happy for you Chris. Wish you two the absolute best. Cheers
I’ve been waiting for this video!!!!! You guys are so cute together 👏👏😎
Abroad in Canada, COOMING SOON.
good for you two,  your legs must be so tingly... from sitting in that tree... K.I.S.S.I.N.G 🤭
Cheers from Montreal, Chris! Had no idea you had family here! Technically here in Canada we pledge allegiance to the Queen so TECHNICALLY you and Sharla have the same head of state
omg this is so good TT_TT i'm so happy that lovely Chris finally was appreciated
I think if mouse didn't have the medical issues, I think her & Conner world have totally happened
CONGRATULATIONS CHIRS!!! My friend who also watches you both sent me the news and we were both "FINALLY!!" I swore the energy you and Sharla had in a recent video before the announcement was like, hugging. (No I don't know how to describe that you guys just had it.) I was like "those two need to date if they aren't already." Super happy for you both!! : )
Perhaps it the power of love that helped with the cat allergy? Just kidding but glad to hear that didn’t become a problem for your relationship 😁
🤣 TRENDING
Also, will you still lead Connor on in your IronMouse persona or is Sharla against that?
RIP Connor
Of course he's not allergic to Sharlas "cat"
Thought it was this Candyman https://youtu.be/Qkjc_5yGCmM 🍭
Good for you man.  I'm pretty happy for him.
Yeah allergies can change with age too
awesome chris
It's not liken we didn't knew that , I was sure something happened a while ago :)
So Tuna’s basically like you , Natsuki and a toy Robot
Tbh, I thought it was all a meme, didn't think it was real 😂😂😂
Get Better, Pete!!!
"conor doesn't shower" 😂
Ryotaro is not even on the list of potential Best Man! Hahahaha!
Woah woah woah I thought this was a fucking joke
👍👍👌👌
Good for you Chris, wish you the best! (Also a Canadian)
Congratulations Chris, you deserve a woman who loves you as much as you love Fami fried chicken 🍗
Congratulations Chris, you deserve a woman who loves you as muchas as you love Fami fried chicken 🍗
Congrats dude!
I’m so happy for you and Sharla that you found each other. Sending well wishes to you both! 💕😊💕
Connor is relieved! lol
I always thought you guys had amazing chemisty and hoped to see you be a couple. But at that time Sharla wasnt single. Glad you’re dating now😻
Omg I love this you two are my favorite travel content!
Love it.
Potangina lettsssss goo
Congrats from another Canadian.
With Connor having the biggest pop off, I think he’s handling it well enough lol
What part of Canada is she from?
man talk about not knowing the internet man, you bein gay has been a running joke for... about 12 years?
Canadians are basically British at the end of the day, are they not.  I mean unless they’re from Quebec or moved there from another country.
Keep GRINNING, you luck Codger !!!!
That's great!
I am not sure if your American accent is good or if just your Pete Premier Two imitation is just amazing.   Also, I've never never dated a Canadian, but I've know a bunch and I'd date a Canadian.
affable man is no longer maidenless. yorokobe shonen
I just want to say. I want to grow up to be like chris and have a beautiful girlfriend like sharla
Can't believe Ironmouse dates Sharla
Connor’s celebration 😂
Congrats Chris! No #foreveralone for you any more 👍🏼😂
I'm more curious as to why she is dating a Brit! Just kidding, i'm happy for you guys and hope you are enjoying yourselves! I think you and Connor are dating on a higher plane of existence somewhere in the multiverse. 😉
you don’t have to cut out meat to be healthy. You still need meat in your diet, it’s important. Just don’t have your source of meat to be burgers or fried chicken
Yea try to keep it on the downlow, don't wanna end up like Simon and Martina
I'm so happy for you, guys! I always loved seeing you two in the same video!
Lol I live like 40 mins from Banff
Banff in just as great in person as it is in the pictures. If you do travel to Canada I highly recommend a visit!
You even look kinda similar! My favorite YT couple now💖
Why is this trending lmao
Man thats pretty amazing, happy for both of you my dude!! Definitely a great couple with a great vibe :D
sharla is one hell of a lucky bloak! i mean you can never ask for a finer english specimen than Chris.
I’ve had my cat for years and my allergies have never gotten better
This is Great News! I'm happy for both of you!
Sharla now has another name and it’s “Sharla in Japan” All that aside, I’m very glad to hear that it’s / happy and healthy relationship. Cheers Chris!
Damn. sharla should make a counter video
I have a more serious question though. Chris. I need to ask...     Is that a RGB headband? If yes, where can I get one?
5:04 that’s why I’m friends with her but yet she’s never once given me any maple syrup.   What is this? 🤣🤣🤣   😉 happy for you guys!
LOL I started dating my best friend 10 years ago and it was my best decision.
Connor doesn’t shower and Chris isn’t gay! 😂
Thought Connor was w*lsh
Imagine Chris tryna fight someone and that mofo just pulls out a cat 🤣 Chris was over! 😭😭🤣
These are the kind of YouTube announcements I typically hate but for some reason this time I’m genuinely happy for you guys.
Anywhere I could watch the whole stream?
I found you through Sharla so it kind of feels full circle because I remember thinking you should date when I first started watching both of you
I'm dating my childhood friend. After both of us being in long relationships with other people we realized we actually have feelings for eachother. 🥰
The cat allergy went away with the power of love/ jkjk
Sooo, is this about Sharla or your favourite cat?
WEDDING WEDDING WEDDING
Bet sharla can cook a good chicken dish thats why chris and sharla is dating
Chris I had the same thing with my cat allergy and then one specific cat that I had to spend a lot of time seeing. You really do build up a tolerance.  Unfortunately, it didn't make my allergy go away completely and with that cat gone my allergies feel the same again.
Tuna the f**k kitten was hilarious 😂 yes yes kittens are what one would call the destructive crack cat phase and it is absolutely a joy to go through, but we can’t live without them ☺️☺️
I knew it!!! congrats you guys!! ❤️❤️❤️
She seems super fun and chill.
I totally agree! my current fiance, we were friends for 6 years before we started dating ❤️ definitely would recommend :)
Yeah, having a loving relatioship is cool and all but have y'all ever had good udon
Why do valley girls hang out in odd numbered groups?      Because they can't even.
Those Delusional shippers are crying right now
Norm Macdonald was right, Canadians have had it FAR too good for FAR too long
I'm just imagining charlie doing the "WOOOOOOOO yeah babyyy"
Keeping it in the Commonwealth, I see.
So you basically gave up on dating natives in japan... lol
I'm just glad Chiaki is still single.
So when we gonna get a flight sim video, kept noticing the Thrustmaster throttle quadrant on the table?
I laugh so hard when someone thought that you were entering from the back 🤣🤣🤣
Congratulations my bro!
I thought she was joking and I still can't tell if you're joking
Now just Connor needs to accept he's and Kaho are dating... congrats Chris, Sharla is a Lucky woman 💔❤️‍🩹
As a hoser, I approve. Let's celebrate with maple cookies and poutine
#26 on trending. Seems like lot of people really want to know about your dating life.
Yeay! Your allergy is gone.  Does that mean we got to get Cat Nation episode 2?
Me and Dave have been rogering.
She a thic Bae
I always thought there was something just by the way Sharla was acting around you during her guest appearance in the first Journey Across Japan series.
'bout damn time, yo.  💖💙💘
Are you kidding me? Dating a Canadian IS the privilege..pfft
Is this part of a longer stream available?
Why was Chris's latest live get taken down?
He's not gay, he's simply European
The first time I saw Chris was in a video with Sharla and he referred to Connor as his boyfriend, so I honestly thought he was gay. *Shrugs*
This guy really is on trending for announcing he’s dating the famous Sharla in Japan
No more guys night out.  Chris will now spend his weekends going antiquing.
😂 the Trash Taste reaction was mike them breathing oxygen again. Lovely. Happy for you both honestly!
Congratulations to the most affable person!
Smiling ear to ear watching this 😊
I know Connor's reaction was like "NOOOOOOO!!!!!". I think he liked her too
Those were just trolls as you have lot of new viewers from the trash taste boys and many other corners of the Internet 😂😂😂 don’t take those comments seriously
Congratz!! I like you both so this is awesome!!
How much female audience did you lose as a result of this announcement? :P Is it a lesson for Japanese entertainment industry?
That American Pete impression is brilliant!! Haha
I think people in my friend group would not agree with you on dating a friend that they have known for so long. They say because we known each other for so long that why no. And up till now, none of my friends partners have been from our initial friend group
I can’t believe there are people who unironically ship Chris with Connor.  Didn’t that devolve into the whole “Chris is actually Ironmouse” meme?
I'm happy for you both! 😃 I saw Sharla's video where she answered the viewer's question about dating you. I was wondering what is taking Chris so long to respond to the announcement!? So good on ya for finally announcing it.  I think Canadians are great and you are very lucky.
I married my friend :) I also thought I’d never see her again when I moved across the United States. I had (and missed) an opportunity to move closer to her for work/school, and I found that I was most upset that I wouldn’t get to spend time with her again. It was then that I realized my feelings for her and invited her into a long-term relationship that finally culminated in a happy marriage of 3 years (so far!).  TL;DR: Chris is right! Date a friend.
So happy for you! I’ve thought for a long time that you’d be good together. Best wishes!
About damn time. Happy for you two
Couldn't have said it better myself! Thank you God! (for real, I'm a Christ follower). Happy for you Chris, make the best of it! Seek Him while you're at it. "(He) wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth." -- 1 Timothy 2:4
c'mon man why you have to badmouth Connor after the fact. You've been together for so long does that mean nothing to you? Really sad :/
Nice one.  Best wishes!  Yep.  Sharla's diet will help big time with your liver.
I don't have any friends 🥲
Sharla: "I'm dating Chris"  Trash Taste boys reaction: winning a World Cup  That's why I love you guys
I disagree, have natsuki as the priest since he’s words are a blessing to everyone.
The power of LOVE! Chris has recovered from Cat allergy 😊.
so glad you guys are happy and i love you both so much💞
Seeing that reaction of four of them, that's a fricking meta experience
When I first heard of the news I was "huh". I like Sharla and Chris but I never really thought of them as an item. But I'm glad you two are happy. I hope she influences you on your health matters (and that she doesn't get sucked in your fried chicken craze). 😅
Bro the candy man that you named my costume is a curse there's a whole other movie on it
What's on your head bruh. Anyway, nice to see my guy finally got a girl.
From New Zealand, I wish you guys all the best!
Cheers! Congrats Chris and Sharla! To be honest, I feel who you or Sharla is dating is your private affair. You do not really need to make it public. But, it is your choice and I respect that. I hope you guys can just be yourself, and date stress free without caring about what the internet is saying.
I never knew this was a separate channel! Just subscribed.
oh no i wanted to watch this stream's vod, where is itttt??
"I'm not gay" he said, while wearing flashing rainbow light hairband.
Figured this was sort of a thing for quite a while now. But happy you two can enjoy time together with a bit less worry with videos now.
I FUCKIMG LOVE BOTH OF YOU! GLAD BOTH YOU DATING 😍
I noticed she liked you back in the first Journey across Japan, she was laughing at all your crap jokes and touching you whenever she could. Well done Chris, you are punching above your weight like but good for you.
Dude, you're #29 on trending. How affable!
Your allergies change over time, and also it depends on the cat. When I got my cat, my face, eyes, and hands were always on fire, but then it got better. If I touch another cat that's not mine, changes are, I will get a bad response. So your body gets used to the allergens you are exposed to every day. Basically, only touch Sharla's cats lol.
You had me at Canadian.
Cherish her always!
bruh yall actually dating i remember both of you solo japan youtubers lol
So is Sharla going to make an appearance on Trash Taste?
How nice. :)
I didn't know this!!! I've heard/read on comments on so many people shipping you guys in the past LOL. Omg. You're dating a Canadian, a sweet Canadian lady whose channel I also subbed to. This feels awkwardly real like finding out two people you know for years suddenly start dating. Congrats, I guess. I hope y'all are happy.
All the best to you two!
That awkward moment where you pretend to date Sharla to hide the fact that you're with Connor.
I don't know if anyone is interested in hearing this but I think it depends on the breed when you are allergic to animals. I am allergic to rats but not all of them. Still can't risk getting anymore pet rats. I am not allergic to the cat I have but I would sneeze like crazy with some of other people's cars. Must have something to do with the fur or what they carrying around on it. Animals have allergies too. My cat has food allergies and I used to have a rat that had skin allergy to ducted heating. It is true that some allergies go away over time or your immune system stops reacting to it. My son was born with peanut and egg allergies and I was advised to slowly introduce tiny amounts of eggs over the years to help his body build resistance. Children hospital research shows that you as a kid have 20 percent chance to outgrow peanut allergy and 70 percent chance to outgrow egg allergy. There is still no answer to why people have allergies in the first place. Same with rheumatoid arthritis. The immune system is complicated.
SHARLA == Connor???????
good for you two. enjoy it!
Congratulations to you Chris and Sharla. I’m over the moon right now as Iam so happy for you guys. Also I dont think Connor is gay (though I could be wrong)
Quite happy for you and Sharla. :)  It was a bit weird though that so many people want to know the ins and outs of their relationship especially last stream since that's a personal matter imo but I hope for the best for the both of you guys! Can't wait for the next season of journey across japan! :D
I figured when Sharla moved to Sendai from Morioka (a city she clearly loved), there was something going on... congratulations on going public!
I agree it's different when you are friends with the person. When you already enjoy the time doing things in common, it just feels natural to be in a relationship. A lot of people always were shipping you both. They were right. Thanks for sharing this.
First of all, congratulations! The way you two went from friends and flowed into a relationship naturally is wonderful, and I wish you all the best.  On an allergy-related note, from personal experience, cats with longer hair tended not to trigger my cat allergy much, if at all. Compared to that, cats with short hair are a huge "get out of here, you fool!" sign, at least for me. I don't know what's the explanation behind it, though.
Why are you dating a Canadian? Cuz you got lucky!!!! We're awesome!!!
Congrats to you both. You've both been wonderful Youtubers on the Japanese front and more. It's so nice to see this pairing. Wish you both the best :D
Cool, I have seen her videos for quite a few years and just recently found out from one of her videos she is from the same city as me, strange small world we live in
Is Connor Canadian? I thought he's from the country with the red dragon flag
So exciting!! You guys should do videos on the best places for couples to visit in Japan!!
I think this is a shocking betrayal of connor
Sad that Ryotaro wasn't a best man candidate
That is actually a good advice. Date a friend, cause then, the relationship starts with a stronger base.. Now question is..  Where to find that kind of friend 🤣🤣🤣  Also, Congratulation Chris and Sharla 🎉 Hope you guys will always stay happy together 😆 With Maro and Tuna too of course
I mean you know the friendship's real when there's a rumor that you're gay for each other. my roommate's partner initially didn't want to make a move on her bc they thought we were dating just bc we're so close of friends and stuff so the friendship between two salty British men is just that real lmao
💫💕💕💕💕💫
Mad respect Chris!, honestly I have been shipping you two ever since she first rode with you in the first journey across japan
Poor Connor?  More like poor Norm.
I like how Chris use "Trash Taste reaction" meme to describe how earth shattering it is.
so happy for you "Dave in Japan" :)
aw i shall withdraw my previous comments
The best relationship you've ever had! YAY! So happy for you both.
Damn, sorry that happened bro. That's rough.
Congratulations my dude! I’ve been watching you both for so long! This was Christmas in August!
oh that's awesome hope it all goose well for you too
how does your bf connor feel?
A year or two ago a guy told me that they are dating when I made a comment shipping the two of them. And I believed that guy.
The other day I was re-watching the Sharla episodes of Journey Across Japan and my girlfriend (who doesn't really watch this sort of content on YouTube) briefly watched an episode with me and at some point asked me whether you two are dating, when I told her I didn't think that you are she said that's a shame because she is obviously in love with him. Couple of days later I see this... and all this time I was shipping you with Connor...
I'm so happy for you two. See, you just never know how things are going to turn out. I'm glad you found each other and wish you a lifetime of happiness.
I'm so happy to watch this video! It made me smile. Happy for you - Chris! Wishing you and Sharla all the best.
That is my daughter. We live in Arizona. Why are you lying about dating her? This is pathetic.
100% first thought was, isnt chris gay? dunno why just always thought that
i too have a massive allergy to cats. all cats. except my own :P Congrats though! I've been shipping this for years!
If you ever do go to Banff would love to meet up. I’m in Calgary which is pretty much your gateway to Banff
no mention of Ryotaro? :')
Well Sharla now has a tour guide if she ever does ‘Sharla in Uk’.
Way to go Chris.  Long time watcher of both channels.  Best wishes.  Hope it all works out.
DUDE CONGRATSSS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO that's awesome!!!!
This piece of news is a spot of sunshine. Congratulations!
Why is Sharla dating VIP Da Big?
My husband and I were friends for a year before we ended up as FWBs, then a year after that we actually thought "fuck, we actually love each other" and now we're five years into our marriage (with another four years of being together before then) :)   And we're still as sappy to each other as the day we realised we were in love.
I have the same philosophy as mr. Broad here when it comes to dating, and I have never dated anyone and single for 20 years and still going strong wwwww  It just has that sense of dilemma of either staying friends or risk everything and ask to date them ya know
Your new hairstyle looks so funny Chris. Best wishes to you and Sharla 😍
you're on trending!
How cute! Hope it works out!
SOOOOOOOOOOO happy you two are together. I always hoped it was true because you always had great chemistry and are my two favourite Japanese related channels. Want nothing but happiness and joy for you two for a long, long time.
Look how genuinely happy our boy is. Congrats to booth of you 🎉🎉🎉
Be honest Chris, you didn't know she was Canadian and are trying to put on a brave face
"I could never date Connor, he doesn't shower, I could never date anyone like that also, I'm not gay"  Had to think that was planned as a joke.  And it got me, well-played.
Banff is extremely overrun with tourists now, so although it's beautiful, you may have difficulty getting into the popular tourist locations.
#35 on Trending!   I see it. On Journey Across Japan there was chemistry!
TRENDING
So now Abroad in Japan has a broad in Japan
NATSUKI FcukingBestMan! 🥰🔥👌🐶❤️
We need a whole episode done in Pete's voice by Chris
How Chris get Sharla date him??  Answer~roofies and chlorophorms! 😂😉🐶
Been speculating this for 2 years
Congratulations to you both
Thanks for helping me win 50$ Chris! 😁
Ever since I saw you two side by side in the park video, you in your last minute candy costume and her getting ready for the YouTube halloween party. It just had to be... Good job man!
wait so is this sarcasm or not sharlas video seems 100% sarcasm but with chris its making it hard to tell if hes srs or not XD
AWWWWWWWWWW ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I KNEW IIIIIIIIIT it was the ~vibes ✨
Very happy for you chris and sharla !!! ^^
Chris abroad building up immunity to sharlaPussy! 😂🐶
That Peter impression is classic
I'm happy for you man, you both make a beautiful couple. I wish the best to your guy's health & happiness. Life is always brighter when you have someone to share it with.
I just realized almost 10 minutes in that Chris and I use the same microphone. The more you know
I really love both of your channels, congratulations to Chris and Sharla! <3
Chris broad destroy Sharla old relationship! He a homewrecker!
This is so sweet!!! I love this :)
Aww, yay! This is great news. You guys make the cutest couple. 🙂❤️
It's sweet that you have a photo of the first time you met. And yes, Chris, it is clear that you don't know who the Candyman is. He's a black man with a hook for a hand, not a sweetie in sight. Decent film, btw
Sharmelons is my favrit Canadian youtuber in Japan! I would date her but she like a cats too much 😞🥰🐶
Very happy to hear this news. Congratulations
I could get used to this happy Chris Abroad, cheers mate!
All the best to you and Roger.
I never comment on these things but this announcement makes me unbelievably happy
Ew I can’t believe you
That was an impressive Pete impression.
The cure for cat allergy: Date the owner of the cat. 🤣🤣
Do a collab in Japan with PewDiePie
Oh my gosh what?!?!? She was being serious!? I thought it was a joke, but I'm so happy for your chris!!
waiting for pewdiepie, marzia, chris broad, and sharla double date fanfic on deviantart
i had a cat allergy but the more i interacted with them it went away lol
Congrats Chris! It's good you waited to see if things would work before announcing it. Glad you both are happy. You deserve it :D
i'm so sorry for being canadian
Because we can spell colour and favourite.
AWESOME!!!!!
Sharla is a keeper if she tolerates that facial hair.
Oh no Chris slipped into an American accent again. Don’t press the unsubscribe button. Press the subscribe button. He is a funny YouTube content creator so support him and his new relationship.
oh my god
The old classic. Is he gay or european?
Also did you look after Maro during her trip back to Canada and Florida ?
Wait, ironmouse is dating Sharla!?
OMG congratzzzz chriss!!!
Isn't Sharla looking to leave Japan again?🤨
Chris, don’t bother with Canada at this moment, it’s a mess thanks to the psychopath in Ottawa.
Lived in Victoria. Lived in Vancouver too. If you and Sharla do take a trip and vlog it, Van  is much better. Always found Vic to be a bit of a bore .
Dating a colonial? My goodness
poor connor his bf left him
The way y’all looked at each other said it all and I’m here for it y’all are so cute together!
You should be ashamed of yourself dating a horrible human being like her and should be utterly bloody ashamed you evil human being
To be honest, when I saw the notification, I thought this will be the kind of video where you debunked or clearing the misunderstood and something like that...  But it turns out that you two actually dating. Congratulations to both of you 🎉🎉. I hope it will be a long and healthy relationship.
So happy for both of you.
Poor Connor, his bf is dating a women
As Borat would say: Very niiiccceeee
Don't cut out meat, switch to solely meat. Trust me, I watched a video online once
Amazing Chris, all the best!
Since I listened to your podcast and watched your videos for years without ever commenting (maybe did one drunk?) or anything, I still know you try to read this shit so... Honestly, all the best to you, you are one small british man I followed for years who helped me over several close ones deaths and much more... I could relate to you all over the years and you made me smile even after I finished university for years to go.  Go buddy, just know that there will be allways people rooting for you in every way....I even enjoy Pete fucking Donaldson know... thanks man...  Cheers from eastern germany and thanks for being the real man for about like 6 years or sth like that. You can't even imagine what kind of influence you had on so many people for years Chris...
You did a lot of things to get where you are in life. And I think all of those things were right things that lead you to success. However this decision will probably be biggest mistake of your life. Just my two cents. I know no one gives a shit, but this is internet and everyone tries to shove their opinion down your throat, so here is me shaking my head in disappointment because I fear that quality of your videos will drop once she is done sucking soul and life out of you.
Congratulations 🎊  I hope the best for you two.
The confirmation of the thing we’ve all seen coming forever. We all ship it.
happy for you guys, but pro-tip don't reduce meat from your diet, instead increase meat and fats and remove all forms of carbs.
thy coochie.
If Connor showered his head I'm sure Chris would have dated him  (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
Thank god !
You can now go on a double date with Felix & marzia 😏
When I first saw you guys on the first journey across Japan I thought for sure you guys were a couple because the chemistry was so strong
Congrats!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOO 🖤
I've been guessing this was a thing since February when she cared so much about the details of the chocolate. She knew so much, it was kind of suspicious.
When he said I have been working with the cats so I could get used to them I was like🤔😏🤫😉
"The Candyman can because he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good"
NO FUCKING WAAAYYY :OO
Well its about damn time!
I didn’t need a video to know you were dating, and I also didn’t need a video to know why…
Not like we didn't see that coming lol.
Uh, and we should care, why?
I don't think anyone is at surprised by this. I have aspergers but even I can tell by the way you look at eachother, especially the way Sharla looks at Chris in even older videos, when she was on cycle across Japan, you could tell there was something there. This isn't new, this has been some time in the making. Love is a beautiful thing, and its been painted on your faces for awhile.
Called this years ago...it always seemed like you two had some interesting chemistry and it's cool to see that you two have a good thing going on. Cheers to you both!
Lol I just thought it was a publicity stunt
You're trending Chris
not gonna lie, that glasses had me double taking thinking its a really rad hairband. still happy for you and sharla, chris. special appearance feat sharla on trash taste?
Poor Connor
I am happy for you both! 😄 This is great. Please get happily ever after. Wish you the best, love Chris Abroad and Sharmeleon. 💋 All the best for you!
have u ever tried calling her sharla-tan lol
The cat allergy going away isn't true for everyone
Thank you for sharing your personal story with us, Chris  ! All the best to you guys ! She's really as sweet and nice as can be  ! Are her cats Siberians ? This breed is known for being less allergic than the rest.
I have to admit, I am confused why you are confused that people thought you might be gay, considering you literally said Connor was your "boyfriend" in one of your videos. In another video - with Sharla - about weird things you have seen in Japan, you told a story about going to a gay bar, soon after first arriving in Japan, and seeing a guy having intercourse with a wall. Another video with Connor, you mentioned some hotels are not gay-positive with regards to renting out rooms to gay men.  Either way I am happy for you because you are funny and create great content. I have learned so much about Japan from you and Sharla. The two of you have put Japan on my bucket-list. You also seem to be a nice person, which is the most important human quality. Your sexual preferences have no bearing on my appreciation and respect for you. But if you are still confused how some people came to that conclusion, I hope I have clarified that for you.
i was going to suggest to either one of them to date each other, but I thought it was not my business, but it happened. thumbs up!!
I guess we know why Connor is single despite him being good looking 😂
Why I'm Dating a Canadian? For their healthcare.
Ok! So uhm.... You have a promise to us that you will name your first born son Donald. Im watching XD
i shipped you both years ago glad your happy
Why have you been privating the streams? I'm not usually able to be there and I'd love to watch the whole thing :(
Well I mean even before Sharla's announcement I just had a feeling you two were cause you could see the chemistry there.  Happy for the both of you!! 🎉😊
Congratulations, Chris!! I had been curious for a while, so it's interesting to see for sure! Take your time together, and I hope it stays wonderful! Also, can confirm about dating a long time friend. You need the right friend, for sure, but my bf and I have known each other for 10 years and started dating in 2020 - bad year, great relationship ♡
its weird seeing way too many people over invested though
because American woman don't like  🔬 pennies
That's definitely the right way to go about it! That way you two were able to build a foundation without it being everyone's business. As well intentioned as fans may be, it would have inevitably added unnecessary pressure and expectations on both of you. Anyhow, congrats! Glad you two are doing well :D
Congrats Chris, now all the Japanese women are heartbroken! 💔💔💔 😆  Also, loved your hilarious impression of Pete. Sounded exactly like him!
Your point is so understandable. Great video
How come you never see Connor and Sharla in the same room.
Congratulations mate
Thank you for the information. I have always considered you as a genuine person. Stay Safe 👍
I’m so happy for you Chris! Hope that the two of you will find tons of happiness together
"I'm not gay"  *wears a rainbow headband *Is british
Ahhh...the coveted Canadian Beavertail...
Lmao, as a gay dude I never once thought you were gay. You and Connor gave of best friend vibes to me.
Brit and canadian? good chemistry for someone with Good weather Gentle Rain and Calm Winter.
The reason I thought you were gay is due to a video you put out recently 'coming out' but I may have missed the joke...it certainly wasn't a comment I made to be unkind, I was just confused. It's not up to me to be happy for you and Sharla but if you two have a good relationship then it's wonderful. It is definitely complicated and confronting to be public about your relationship.
I've gotta give you big up respect for this video. I have after five long years started dating a really close friend of mine, since just the last couple of days and she means the world to me. I'm really happy about you and Sharla and I hope it works out for the best. Natsuke would have been my choice as a best man as well - big up to both you and Sharla😁
I always loved them together! This is great news!!
Now that you are dating a Canadian, will you stop calling potato chips "crisps"?
o didint know she was from victoria, i live on the island as well, its beautiful out here once u get out of Victoria or Nanaimo
apples innit
I agree with your life advice. I met my bf in college & got to know him for around 2 years before we decided to get together. It was a friendship that slowly blossomed into something more. It's one of the slower ways of getting into a relationship, but it's pretty great. :) I wish you two the best!
Congratulations 🎉  Also, your "American Midwestern" accent cracked me up. Pete should be proud.
I'm very happy for you both. A good friend once told me that your partner should be your best friend because when you are old, saggy and baggy, you will still love them for the thing that attracted you to them in the first place - your friendship. I followed that advice and married a true friend. We're now saggy, baggy and take the p*ss out of one another every day. We still love one another very much. Good luck you crazy young 'uns!
I'm actually happy for you ...WTF 😒 I wanted  you to be a miserable old man complaining about life and everything else but now you're going to be happy. Ah well, we can't have it all. Haha, in all honesty, she's my girl, and I'm stoked, happy for you both.
nice one dude
Finally Chris has a Girlfriend! I’m so Happy for you both 💕 cheers! 🥂
Like I said on Shar, I seriously thought you two had dated previously or were dating, lol.
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations on both of you getting together!  Let’s hope this lasts and becomes a permanent thing.
Can we get a 'Journey Across Canada' series next? Lol
Fucking knew it. I’ve been watching you and Sharla independently for awhile. Cute, hope it stays fun :)
I love seeing that everyone was secretly shipping y'all this whole time, including myself lol
Good job mate. Happy relationship. And great transitions between the 60fps and 6fps cameras. Awesome 👌. Cheers.
Your American accent 😂😂😂 actually it wasn’t bad but funny to hear you do it
Congratulations 👏 👏
I just got over a really tough relationship and I've been hurting for some time. However, the news of this really made me happy and I generally hope it works out for the both of you.
The Queen will be pleased. Up the Commonwealth.
So, you are not gay?
Congratulations Chris, that's so cool. And yeah, the Candy Man costume works, obviously.   "First you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women!"
Chris isn't gay! He's just British... ;-)
First Pete Davidson is dating Kim Cardashian and now this.. I have nothing left to throw up.
03:30 a sign from the heavens
Wait a minute I thought Sharla was engaged to be married with somebody I’m confused 🫤?
So happy for you and Sharla! I have been watching her channel for years, and actually found yours through her. 🥳
I've been saying you two would be great together for years! Glad to see you're together now :)  The Chris x Connor stuff is kinda hilarious tbf.
The world is extremely weird now.  Like I am like "wow cool, they seem like they have such good chemistry in their videos, cool!" and a strong enough impulse to say it that i'm going to the trouble of leaving a comment even though I generally watch vids on apple TV.  Here we are.  Yet this is extremally none of my business.  Why do I care? I shouldn't.  But I do.  Congrats to you and your happiness.
Woooooooo
You either die Candy Man or live long enough to become Man
Start a new channel "gayinjapan"
You heard it here, folks! The friend zone is bullshit and you should totally date someone you know you get along with as a friend XD
🙂
but what about Natsuki?
Wait, you and Connor not dating? LOL. Peace!
I love that you can hear Chris cheering in Connors video
Wise decision, public relationship stuff is wild and rude. But I can see how well you two complement each other! Congratulations!
Pete impression was spot on.
I'm so happy for you!
Investigating shojin ryouri might be a good idea
3:38 It’s good that you’re not allergic to Maro, but are you allergic today? 😉
Good taste Chris, She's a sweet gal and you guys have amazing chemistry.
I saw this from a mile away lol.
What's it like for Sharla to be in a relationship with an OAP?
Its Funny How some people really think Chris And Connor are dating
But what about Connor? He must be heartbroken
Your American friend accent was hilarious
My partner used to be allergic to cats. Some cats either produce less of the most common enzyme people react to, some breeds are known for that like the Rex breeds and Bengals like I have, or your body really just gets used to it through exposure. Pretty much how immunization would work if you went to a doctor for a cat allergy just with more cuddles and less shots and meds. That's how it worked with my partner, cuddling with our first Bengal who does produce significantly less of that enzyme slowly showed his body that there is nothing to freak out over. Then we got a second Bengal and his last allergy test basically showed no reaction anymore. Even the doctor was surprised how much his allergy has reduced. Which is great for my partner because now he can cuddle all of the cats he meets. Especially at his job as an electrician for a rental company.
To be honest though, I thought that Chris was dating Chiaki way way back. But after watching Journey Across Japan and several of their collab videos, I've kinda had the guess that Chris and Shar had something special. I vote for Natsuki as the best man, anybody else would be a complete blasphemy.
Since she moved back from Korea?! Shit man. Secret well kept. Happy for you both. Especially you Chris, since you've found a woman who literally stopped aging when she was 27.
👍👍
British Chris is just re-asserting dominance over a former colonial subject.
Happy for both of y’all! Aloha from Hawai’i
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Everyone happy for them, then there's me hoping they have a rough public breakup in a year. I love Chris but I also love drama 🤣
Congrats man! I would stay away from Canada though. Its Terrible and only getting worse here :(
Really happy for you both, keep being awesome
lol whyyyy
This fucking rocks. Love you both!
I thought that was a joke in Sharla's video lol  Congrats to both of you tho
Because monolingual English speakers got nothing better but surround themselves with other English speakers?  P. S. You look like Philip Seymour Hoffman from Flawless (1999) here
Kawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiii explosion!
So happy for you guys!!!🥰🥰🥰 With cat/dog allergies, you build up a tolerance to specific cats/dogs you're around often, you get immune to their particular dander or something.😺🤷‍♀
Congrats, Chris and Sharla!  I just heard about it this morning from Ironmouse!  Here's hoping you spend many happy years together!
Now we just need to find Connor a significant other.
This shouldn't make me happy because you're strangers, but damn am I happy for you guys.
So happy for you two, Chris and Sharla. Best Wishes.
About time. Maybe this will reduce all the Chris Broads sausage-fest video's. Really starting to worry about you.
we kinda already knew.. for years.. #congratz! 😄🎉
i wish you guys all the best, you deserve it. if you're ever in vienna, beer's on me.
Ya come to Banff!!!!
Just..congrats Chris and Sharla! Simple.
Is it weird I saw this coming years ago?
Please come to Banff one day!! I live only a few hours away from it and have been there multiple times and you’d definitely love it! And congrats on the relationship 🎉💕
ahh i’m so happy for you two 🎉🖤
This is excellent news
I'm allergic to cats too, prolonged exposure helps. I'm friends with random outdoor cats that I meet on my walks, they don't trigger my allergies anymore.
Trash Taste are such good friends lol, They seem so happy for you.
Congrats man :3
I’m sure all the Connor comments are jokes. First thing I thought off. People where also congratulating iron mouse for her new relationship
Lovely 🥰
gotta check your  male to female ration after this video
Oh how lovely!!! You guys seem like a beautiful couple, you genuinely look perfect together 🥰
You can see the pain in Connor's eyes.
Good to know you're not gay...ha, ha...
I'm disappointed that it's not Celine Dion or Bryan Adams!
I'm allergic to dogs (sadly) and as i've been around them more it does get a bit better! So it's probably the same with the cats. Few anti-histamines be grand :D
Poor Gant gets zero love.
"I thought Chris was gay" bruhhh 😂
Good job. Now that you guys are out of the closet, going to need Sharla to go into the closet and burn all of Chris's Capri pants.
GZ CHRIS!!!!
"Also I'm not gay" 🤣🤣🤣
Abroad in Canada confirmed.
I knew it  😄
The American accent is on point. Wow I never realized I sound like that, especially when in contrast to a British accent.
Maroo and chuuuna?
What’s cute is that Chris said he used to watch her videos back then. And was so happy to meet her in person. Lol they are dating. Lol 😝
It's a risk-reward thing though innit? I started dating my best friend of 10 years, we broke up, and I was down a friend as well.
lol. TkyoSam called yall out a while back on one of his rides.
I had a feeling lol 😂 when she moved to Sendai was the clue lol 😆
But where you get those glasses w the lights at tho ??😎😎😎
Your impression of Pete was spot on. Whenever you need to do an "American" accent, just do Pete instead
Canadians are legal, you dont have to explain yourself or anything
I wanna know where the funky headband is from
I didn't believe it until now, congratulations. You've always had a great dynamic together, so seems like a good fit. Best of luck to the two of you.
So happy for you both. And it was wise to build up the relationship. So many people just rush in and don't give it time. Wish you all the best, Chris!
I’m gonna call y’all out you have had a thing for her ever since you guys went biking on your journey across Japan. You two guys met up and we’re riding your bikes over one of the bridges and one of you made a comment about how beautiful it was and your camera was not on the environment your camera was on that young lady. Think she was married at the time.  I just was wondering when you would figure it all out and when she would figure it all out to be honest with you I’ve known for almost 3 years
As someone who's demisexual,  I heavily relate to the sentiment that dating friends is the best idea. Besides the fact that I don't feel attracted to people unless I already have a strong emotional bond with them, being with friends means you (assumingly) have a strong foundation of loyalty and trust, and you're more likely to know how to communicate and understand each other. It doesn't necessarily work for everyone, but I do believe friends to romantic partners is more stable than just meeting someone new or dating an acquaintance.
I've never had anyone so happy for me as the taste crew. Lol I think everyone I know(including me) are too exhausted to be this happy about anything. Lol
So happy for you guys! Finally!…
You need to keep eating fatty meat and cut carbs, look BBBE challenge by Dr. Ken Berry on Youtube or Butter Bob Briggs. No fried breaded stuff, only if it's fried chicken in lard.
Aaaaah, just wishing you two all the best in this endeavour. Take your time, please. Mind your own business, everyone else can fuck well-off with regards to anything that's not their business. Maybe Connor needs you to apply some sun-screen every once in a while on the beach in Ishigaki, but that doesn't NECESSARILY make you gay. I'll say less about Connor... >_>
Make a video saying “I have a girlfriend” without making a video saying “I have a girlfriend” 😜
This is the happiest I've seen chris in the video.
Very happy for you and Sharla, Chris. I know she is the right one for you. 😁
I'm so happy for you dude I think you really deserve it! You're an inspiration and your videos are all amazing. Keep on the good work mate ! (Maybe keep less of the chicken tho)
Omedetou!!!!! We need all your buddies and Sharla to do a wacky weekend all together to celebrate!!!
How is this schlubby old man dating a babe like Sharla?
So, what does Chris think of the Canadian national dish, poutine?😆😉
I'm weirdly happy about this.
just cutting down on meat alone again, does not make you fit, there is still all the alcohol, softdrinks snacks etcetc
No, no. A simple 👍 just won’t do. I need YAY!!!! and fireworks.
Ngl i thought it was prank.
Why am I dating a Canadian?  Eh the wap obviously
I also thought you might be dating Connor...with all the love hotels and jokes about being a couple in Wacky Weekend. BUT I am delighted by this, I love you both and hope that you are happy.
I legit just thought he was leaning into a meme
It is easy to change your diet, meat doesn't need to be the mainstay of the Western diet. And having a close friend to urge you nicely with alternatives makes life easier, I have done the same.
Alright everyone, you heard Chris. It's time to make a friend and within 10 years you'll have a chance. 🌹
Yoo congratulations for my favorite YouTuber
Ughhh. Chris seems so happy and that makes me crazy happy lol. Poor Connor though lol.
Yeah, definitely dangerous territory, bringing a relationship into the spotlight, but I wish you two the best. May the relationship be strong enough to weather the storms of the internet where there be crazy people...
Who cares for the royals when we have Chris and Sharla?!
Lmao the title of the video is so funny ababsjahababaha
Congrats on your relationship Chris
honestly i kinda suspected you guys were dating awhile ago, back when the quake happened it seemed obvious...glad you're happy together...as for the video title, it's because canadians are the perfect foil for british sarcasm due to their personalities :)
I never thought your were Gay. You're a guy who enjoys people, having fun with mates and getting upto daft things together, what else do mates do?! Guys can hang out together without having any sexual inuendo.
Congrats, Chris. This is great news!
yeah! when i heard on the podcast i was like "huh....yeah okay. yes. yes this is nice news to hear. i like this. good for them"
I actually thought you were dating Joey + Natsuki. My bad. Go a ahead mate!
Tl;dw - if you want gf, you have to go outside
So happy for you mate, I've been pretty convinced you've been with Sharla for about 4 years now. We should all have someone who looks at us like she does.
RIP Connor x Chris 😢
Will Sharla appear for $10 thousand dollars! Like the supermodels of years past?!
i thought conner was dateing iron mouse ,not chris
Freaking finally
Canadian girls are awesome! Good job!
Omg! I always loved your interactions together your chemistry was undeniable!! I respect you guys kept it private, although I had my suspicions 😂 The news brought a huge smile on my face I literally smiled sooo hard the whole video. Much love to you both 💕 congratulations 🎉
I was the same way with cat allergies, I used to be severely allergic where my neck would get all red, and itchy and I would constantly sneeze any time I was around cats. But over the years of watching my friend's cat I'm now able to be around them with no issues!
Not a surprise at all.  It was broadcasted in both individuals behavior when around each other.
Canadian women are the greatest and Quebec women are best in the world!🥰
Congrats Sharla and Chris😋😊
Well you already have plenty of australian friends, it makes sense that you'd want to experience the good part of the commonwealth too.
I’m happy for both of you
7:00 That photo looks cute😊 and cool😎 at the same time
british bottom teeth
Poor Ryotaro! LOL
So happy for you two! But I have to address something that has nothing to do with the theme of this video.   When the video first started,  I thought "Why is Chris wearing a glowing, color-change headband?" Took me a minute to realize they were glasses. 🤣🤣🤣
But Connor?
Ive always kinda thought they would make a good couple, watched both of them from early on. Im glad they are happy 🥰
Ew, but she's like all 3D and shit
I’ve shipped you two for nearly a decade now 😂😂 I’m here for it
I'm personally not interested in the Japanese YT dating reports, but good luck to the two of you off camera.
So surprised you both made videos! Sharla and you are my favourite Japanese YouTubers (sharla for calming vibes and you for sarcastic vibes). You both cheer me up when days get hard. I am hopeful for a future video with you and Maro in the room. I wonder what wise Maro first thought of you
Poor Connor…
Chris, are you worried that as a lot of your family live in Canada, and Sharla is Canadian, that you're both actually related?   There...that's in your head now. Sleep well tonight. :P
I'm so happy for you two! I admit I shipped you with Connor or Chiaki, so I'm surprised! In the best way!
I have pretty bad cat allergies too! Same burning feeling, hives, etc. I take Xyzal or Levocetirizine(generic name) once a day and it's like my allergies disappeared. I definitely recommend it if you are ever in the need for allergy meds!
Canada is still both good and nice.
That’s great news! Best wishes for you Chris! You earned it!
YOUTUBERS DATING!?! lol! congratulations! Hope it goes well :)
Guys, do not freak about about this, Sharla is his girlfriend, Connor is his boyfriend. Everything is still ok.
I guess I'd be lying if I said there was never a moment of wondering how close you were with Conner, but that was mostly when I was still new to the community. It became pretty clear after the first year that you were just good friends, glad to hear your in a happy relationship now though!
Wish you two the best!!!
Next people will say when is he going to start having kids..
Reason I wouldn’t date Connor  1: he smells  2: not gay
For the maple syrup jaja
Wow congrats. I thought this was a meme but nope
I gotta admit, when sharla announced it at first and you didn’t say anything, I thought that was uncool of you. But this video made your cool points skyrocket. So happy for you two, can see that cheeky smile on your face expressing your happiness and it’s awesome. Best wishes for you too and looking forward to more collabs!
Mad respect on the decision of keeping things private. Not every aspect of ones life should be in social media or in this case Youtube. Wish you both well.
good for you guys ! best of luck to you both !!
Fried Tofu.....meets.... Lawson's Fried Chicken.... ❤
Wooo go Chris
After six weeks the allergey went away, well it's either that or you die I suppose.
Has Chris been in a relationship with a Japanese woman before?
Happy for you Chris, hope you two are very happy long into the future too.   Pro tip though, cutting out meat isn't healthier in and of itself. Restricting your total calories is what will move you to the lower weight you want. Combine it with a consistent weightlifting routine and you'll be happy with the results I'm sure.
this seemed like the most predictable thing on the planet. Every time I saw her in Abroad videos she seems like great fun and  I wondered if Chris and Sharla had hooked up and if not, why not? 😄
Congratz to you guys!
I'm allergic to cats, but the more you are around specific cats, or at least this is how it is for me, the symptoms start to calm down and only get sporadic flareups. That's probably what's happened with you, Chris! ^--^  Congrats to the both of you, much happiness and joy for you two!! \o/
What's your favourite love hotel?
So looking forward to you guys being in more vids together!😆💕
So happy for you both 😊
Shout out to Victoria, my home town. Im living just north of there now.
Maybe you're used to their dander now🤷‍♀️
I remember when I watched that older video where you guys talked about meeting as the Candy man, I was SO suspicious you were already dating. Had to be like 3+ years ago now.  Also, as someone who was married to a vegan for 3 years (She eventually dropped all dietary restrictions), I would say, it's absolutely possible to live your own life, become a little more healthy, but not go full veg. I do think that's a huge test of relationships and autonomy, and I think many people would fail based on how shocked ppl were when they found out we were different. Always felt weird to be so shocked... it wasn't really a big deal. The only real issue was making sure she could eat wherever we wanted to go. ANd if you have a buddy that you can go to a steakhouse every once in awhile, it's really not a problem. Vegans get a bad rap from the VERY vocal ones out there, but thats more a wider personality issue at that point, if you ask me. (Or my wife lol)
You once said in a video that you don't want to get married and don't want children either. What does Sharla think about that?
i felt this relationship in my bones Chris
Perfect intro
Dating Connor doesn't make you gay it makes you a jojo's fan
Holy moly that Pete impression is spot on Chris.
Cant belive shes dateing iron mouse....thats why everyone was saying poor connar
can't say I am surprised. Lowkey thought you were dating since the first trip around japan to be honest haha
knew. it. you can't fake that kind of chemistry. you can see it in that first pic. Aaaand in your JAJ vids. i think it ended b/c of you, Chris. you were meant to be
someone please EDIT THIS!! make him say he is gay, and he is dating connor. as well as not dating sharla. maybe add in that they love taking showers together LOL
Its true, the best relationships are with someone you've known for years. My boyfriend and I were friends at first and then we started dating after 2 years of being friends. In May we celebrated our 12 year anniversary.   Congrats Chris and Sharla :D I'm wishing all the happiness in the world for ya.
Hey Chris. Love that you are cutting down fun highlights from streams now but if you could also leave up the vod of the stream too that would be so awesome! I like to watch them while working lol
Man cannot live by FamilyMart chicken alone... Happy for you both.
I think one perk of dating a Canadian is you're allowed to do black face.
I was very happy to see this. You guys really have noticeable chemistry, and your videos definitely had me wondering about that. My partner even said something about it too during the video about the Yamadera Temple!  I also second the date your friend. I met my partner at work years ago, and we started as friends, although the chemistry was definitely noticeable enough that people started making comments about it. He slowly became my best friend, the best friend I've ever had in my life. I then left that job to have an *adventure* (yes, it was an adventure, in good and bad ways) teaching english in China for a bit, and then after that I returned home to the U.S.  He picked me up at the airport and I could just tell that the air was thick with this tension, and as we got close to the car, he took my hand, kissed me in the snow (in the airport parking lot with people watching us lol) and the deal was done. I've been with him officially for 8 years. I can't tell you how much of a relief it was to finally have it out in the open, and for us both to admit it. Phew! It's been a great near decade now. I know not all things work out that way, but when it does happen, you feel like the luckiest person alive. So yes, in my opinion friends are definitely a good idea! <3
Congrats Chris! I hope it works out for you both.
Chris suffering through the "Is he gay or is he European?" thing.
Im really jealous and bitter, so, wish you the worst?! 😤🤬🖕
Dead ass can't tell if this is a joke or not, just simply the fact that Chris is very sarcastic in nature. I watched Sharla's  original video. No seriously, I can't tell this is a joke or not please tell me this is real.
Oh, so this finally happened. I mean, we all knew it since that morning market episode on Journey Across Japan: Neverending Cycle of Japan. But it seemed to take you two quite a while.
Happy for you, congrats man. Hopefully now you'll cool it with the self deprecation. Saw a video on my suggestions feed from your Clips channel "why Americans hate me" or something like that yesterday and it irritated me. I didn't watch it. You're not as hated as you seem to focus on you being. It's the internet, I'm sure you get A LOT of hate but that isn't to say you're hated, or that you're fat, or ugly, or anything. You're a cool dude, just accept it already. Anyway, congrats again. Bring her on an episode of your podcast!! Lol
I always loved when you appeared in each other’s videos. You can feel the chemistry and good vibes through the screen. So happy for you two!
Thank you so much for this video and letting us into your personal lives. When Sharla announced it I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not, and even the trash taste boys reaction i thought it was a prank. I'm so happy for you both, I've been watching you both for so many years now and you both deserve love and happiness.  I know dating is your own private life but I would love one video with you both doing Japanese couple things/date spots or talking about the differences with dating in Japan vs western country.
Lol just goes to show you that even if you go to Japan and become Internet famous it still does not get guarantee you a Japanese waifu
So Connor's available 🤔😏
Omedetou Gozaimas Chris! Ganbatte kudasai!
after the ride across japan , i though , dammmm chris should date her ............... great minds think alike
Wow, this was hilarious! When he said people were saying, "poor Connor", I thought it was because people thought Connor liked Sharla! But, plot twist! People thought he was gay! Bawhahaha! Yo, your comment section is making better plot twists then M. Night Shyamalan! Just because they do Wacky Weekend, is that why? Or because Connor rented a boyfriend?
Spy x Family sort of situation
Bruh, reply her messages lol
So happy for you both! Such a great couple! ❤️
I feel so happy for Chris. He’s always struggling with relationships and friends. So for it to finally work out means a great deal to me. Hope for the best Chris. Remember Happy wife happy life :)
Dating is a personal thing and it's really no one's business other than your own. That being said, I'm really happy for the two of you and hope things continue to bloom.
I thought this was a joke
Natsuki > Conor & Joe
Nah bro, he's not dating her, he is just hiding the fact that he is dating Connor
Congratulations to you both And as someone that was friends with their partner for about 6 years before ever dating can also recommend. It has been great we already got on well and had fun and when other relationships ended we started hanging out more after a bit decided to date and we will have been married 8 years this November. Wish you both a very happy life and many new cat buddy's over the years lol
Chris’ Pete impression is hilarious
Congrats Chris! I always kinda wondered how you did not end up together. I always thought you were a good fit. XD
there is nothing quite as hilarious as a guy trying to prove that he's not gay and that he in fact has a girlfriend. i had a good laugh. glad to hear though dude, well done, she seems cool. also, i enjoy the content, keep up the good work.
I KNNEEEEWWWWW IITTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm dating a Canadian too =D
I always saw Chris as Connor's good friend or father figure. Or... that one uncle who takes you everywhere
Well done mate, she seems as a very nice girl.👍
the cats thing is because i think they're siberian cats and they don't produce the chemical that brings allergy
Isn't  Canada part of the common wealth?  I don't think that gets you any advantages. Even the monarch is the same.
Happy to hear about you and Charlette ! Also, you are correct that many animal allergies abate relatively quickly as your immune system adjusts to that individual animal's signature.  This does not mean you will be used to ALL individuals of that species.
i figured
What happened to the stream VOD, is it being uploaded again?
CONGRATZ CHRIIIIIS ! AND SHARLA ! Good luck guys!
Yo what Chris aint gay?!
Lmaooo the pete impression is really good
Never in my life have a heard something that put me into a 50/50 split of believing it or not. How tf do I decide if I believe this or not.
no way!!!! I SHIPPED THEM FOREVER AGOOOOO!
Omg Yassss So Beautiful 🤗 🥂🍾🎉🎊🌈
Congratulations!!! best of luck and lots of success
It's aboot time you got a girl eh
Congrats again to you both! 😊 as long as you are happy thats all that matters! Also i love that the cats accepted you too 😊
UTTERLY UNRELATED COMMENT. What’s the tune at the end please 😊
Really good dude friends can easily come off as gay to people that are not gay, with the in-jokes and laughing and just good companionship :) The gays usually say "those guys? lol no they're just good friends" 'cause they get it
*Goes to japan to find an asian girl to suit my fetish.  *ends up marrying a white girl.
Lets GOOO!!!!!
I think different kinds of cats might make the allergies worse than others. My mom is allergic to cats but my long haired cat doesn’t bother her very often
Very excellent.  I still want to see Maro and Tuna keeping Chris calm and relaxed.
I still can’t get over how happy I am for this gaaah
I don't think what you do in your private life should be an issue, but you guys have handled this in the best possible way. Long term happiness and blessings to you both. Muffy from Oz.
About time
The chemistry was always there dude, but I was still hella surprised to see this. Fuck yeah, I’ll be rooting for you guys!
This is a sham.. we all know its a cover up. Connor is still best waifu
Congrats! 🎊 I’m going through the same thing right now and it’s great. It’s the best way to start things off! 😁
she looks like you
That one instagram pic you posted of date night with someone in a black hooded coat.  Next video of Sharla and the coat is sitting there draped over a chair.  Hmmmmmmm.
My favorite two Japan-tubers dating... I don't know if it's weird that it puts a smile on my face, but it's two people I like being happy together and that's just something I appreciate.
yyyaaaaayyyy, i had my suspicions
The next wacky weekend could be tense.
1:38 "Would date again."  I just died 🤣🤣🤣🤣
CANDY MAN MY @$$, CHRIS DRESSED AS SUGAR DADDY BUT DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT
Aaaaaaawwwwwwwwww
ps: dont move to Canada lol
Oh my god, yes! Thank you! This made my day! 😍
Congratulations 🎉 … I thought you 2 looked good together….. Congrats once again …..I was wondering if you 2 would get together as I noticed you get along very well. Congratulations once again. Love all your content …..
Ur not gay? Damn
❤️
Glad it worked out for you guys but please for the love of God, if anyone wants to try dating a friend, make sure the feeling is MUTUAL before pursuing. Had a 10 year friendship ruined because a buddy I viewed as a brother confessed his love for me. It got super weird after that and we couldn't be around each other.
It‘s a great video, I am happy for you two.
Chris, you unironically look much happier and healthier recently. Good for you!
This is so wholesome and cute. Congratulations!
Honestly every time my mum and I watched your videos featuring Sharla we always thought you were cute together. This is like the obvious relationship in a show finally happening and it fills me with such elation.
Good for you mate! and, you have managed to avoid the Gaijin stereotype :P
Banff!  Beautiful.  Fairmont Jasper Lodge beautiful.
Conner be waiting in the wings until Chris is on the rebound
The way you look at each other. We knew. We always knew. Hugs from 🇨🇦
Of course they're dating, men and women can't be friends people if they get that close and don't lose touch for years it's for another reason because invariably sooner or later one of them will make a move on the other and if the other rejects them that's the end of the friendship when it's not it's because the rejectee wants to try again later
I SHIPPPPPPPP YESSSSSS
Sharla is amazing!! Congratulations to both of you!! 🥰
S-tier Pete impression.
Congratulations for both of you
HAHAHAHA always knew!!! yay have fun both of you!!!
You are playing well above you level,  Chris. Well done!!! Lovely lass.
all of the guys screamin and cheering u and sharla on gives me life!!! so happy for you guys!!!
I guess now we know,  Chris isn't gay
Now Sharla's victory in Valentines chocolate competition is understandable. Chris simply don't have any choice there.
He was a candyman snd she had a sweet tooth ;)
Nice!
How come guys who date Sharla, "Speak through their mouth like Pitbull?"
That Pete inpression was scary accurate.
I love how he doesn’t mince words or try to be diplomatic for the sake of being nice. Says it just as is. Gotta love a Brit for that
Stunning and brave to admit to dating a Canadian. Proud of you Chris
I can't believe Chris accomplished the impossible. There's hope for us all
I have to admit hearing Chris say it’s the best relationship he’s ever had made me so soft 🥹 So nice seeing them so happy!
There is an acclamation time for every allergy. Most allergies are just weaknesses people have to things they haven't been exposed to enough. The more time they eat those things or be exposed to those animals in your case cats the more their body will acclimate and build up your bodies tolerances towards these things.
‘Bout time. Congrats!
Holy shit , Knew it I thought this l Sometime ago , fucking knew this was gonna happen , next is Emma and jordan
So funny when you talked about Canada around minute 5. I just came back from a holiday in Canada where is visited Banff, Victoria and Vancouver xD
I am actually happy that you guys are together, just hope you can deal with the cats lol. But no really, I think both of you need happiness in your life. Hope it goes well. If her cats are not bothering you, then it could be they are hyper allogenic as well which would actually be rather good for you.
Now I'm so curious about when you started dating,  like in which videos were you guys together? Since your humour is always so teasing of each other haha
Been single for years but at least chris  got a W
congrats  about  damn time happy for you 2
I have been with my husband for 11 years now. We started off as friends in high school, so I absolutely agree.   Happy for you two!!
Congrats...quite obvious considering how well behaved he was and more importantly....how much the blue blazer/ jacket was used! :)
Actually cried when i saw this then quickly checked the date to make sure it wasn't April 1st. So happy for the both of you. Well done guys.
Congrats to you two ❤️
Congrats Chris! I wish you a long and happy relationship :) and with that, Connor is now the only single lad (not that there's anything wrong with that, my man's focused on the GRIND) Garnt - Sydney Joey - Aki Daidus - Emily Chris - Sharla Meilyne - her husband
I have a cat allergy too! For some cats I can’t even be near them without my eyes becoming itchy/throat closing up but for some it doesn’t happen. Not sure why 😅
I had a feeling about you two when I first started watching you both years ago! Congrats!
I was sort of already suspecting it when Sharla showed up in a Norm video and they talked about her just having moved to Sendai.  What the heck would she have to do all the way out there except for Chris?  Congratz on making it Youtube official guys and may you enjoy each other's company for many many years to come!
shes from my province! I shop at the same Japanese supermaket chain she used to work at here:)
-To reapeat history?-
Definitely agree that it's best to date someone you've known a while. My husband was a contractor at my workplace for 2 years before we dated.  It was good to find out his general interests, his viewpoints, his sense of humour, and - most important of all - an idea of his personality without him being under pressure to impress me. Guys I met in nightclubs, in pubs, and (worst of all) blind dates - argh! Never worked out! Some truly abysmal experiences there.   I wish you both all the best. You're a cute couple.   By the way, glad you're changing your diet too. That was a point of concern, watching you eat all that greasy muck and, at times, way too much of it. It does catch up with you eventually - as I well know.  Now, I'm mainly vegan, occasionally straying back to vegetarianism if there's ice cream around (sorry vegans, I'm a sucker for mint choc chip ice cream). Quality of vegan foods just improves all the time, and I soon found the taste of meat deplorable. I don't miss it at all.
It was pretty obvious though lol.
Banf is very beautiful place and the kiing is awsome
I thought she was joking when she said it haha, happy for you low-key jealous I always had a big fat e-crush on Sharla
Now thjat I see it confirmed, congrats to both of you. I hope you both live long and prosper.
Me an my husband were friends in high school. Started dating after a year and been together since so ya I always tell ppl that too lol
From Abroad in Japan to Dating in Japan 👌
Wrong maple leaf in the flag
She's hot! I'd date her too! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You don't really need to cut out meat. Contrary to the trendy narrative that's actually not good for you. You definitely should cut out/down on low quality meat. Especially fried meat. That's more the issue.
Everyone's talking about the dating a friend thing ... I've never been with a guy who didn't immediately try to date me. Like I haven't had any single guy friends who didn't just try to kiss me within a few days of knowing me. I don't understand it. Sounds so magical but I've never had that. That being said, my current boyfriend and I were definitely best friends right away, we just... also kissed lol.
You guys have tremendous chemistry and I'm super glad that chemistry translated really well into real life too! Happy for you both :)
I swear, I hate this reaction clip from the beginning 😂 Especially Connors part, which I've seen a million times by now...
WOOOOOOOO! Happy for you both!
Hey Chris! Will you be the BEST MAN at Joey’s Wedding?
Finally!! You two will do great together! Congrats!!🔥
soooo freaking happy for you guys. honestly, it was meant to be. your chemistry is incredible.   and please record a podcast episode with Sharla again!! would love to her you two talk now without being afraid that people will read more into your interactions.
As a fellow Canadian I’m sorry for your loss ….. haha 😂 just kidding congrats guys!
I knew you were gay!
I knew Chris was not gay, he's just English
I remember when you made videos with Sharla and Rachel like 7 years ago (what happened with Rachel??). You always made her Sharla laugh. That was a good precedent.
Conner's reaction fucking killed me
One big meme has always been that Chris and Connor are dating. RIP to that meme.
Okay so I just found out about your podcast and I’m listening to the old one and one was your story about “a girl” you took out and woke up and there was a bug near her head. Was that my sweet Sharla????
We’re all very happy for you both 👍
My current relationship started off as just an average friendship, no intentions or slightest thoughts ever went into us dating ever. And one day after we got done playing some games together the topic of relationships came up, we started sharing our views on dating, and that eventually lead to me being asked out, then the next thing I know it's been almost three years and me and my BF are still going strong, supportive of one another and are happier then we've ever imagined. At first I was afraid of the honeymoon phase, but that's long since past and we're at a place where we can just do our own things and don't have to be glued to the hip every five seconds, he has his Warhammer hobby (he gets really passionate about his miniatures and it's cute) and I do my own VR stuff, which he also joins me from time to time. He travels to his home state with his family all the time since his grandma isn't of good health, and I've gone with him a few times to meet his father, and his friends he grew up with. All lovely and very welcoming people, his grandma is very sweet and gentle. We're currently planning on getting a place together hopefully by the end of next year..
Phoebe: "This is brand new information!"
I never thought you were gay. Happy for you two!
The cats that Shar has don't have the enzyme in their dander that sets off cat allergies. That's why.
Well, I'm very happy for you two, I fu*king love you two, amazing duo, perfect combination if personalities, with all the sincerity I wish you guys a very happy future together, I know that it might sound strange but I'm so happy for you two like you've been good friends 😅
Congratulations  to you both, as I feel I know you both, such is the power of the internet.
Wow as a long old subscriber I'm happy for you both! I had no idea Sharla was ever married or moved to Korea but I do like her cameo's on your videos I'm glad to see you happy!
my cat allergy gets better after  about 4 days (with only a slight breathing problem compared to huge breathing problem and eye itching) BUT it will go back if I'm away from cats for a month. So my friends always have allergy pills att home from me and other friends ^^ also congrats on your relationship, honestly hoped you and CDawg where pan cuz I love the representation of seeing others like me. Still really happy for you ^^
Because she lives in the same area, and due to similar “jobs” end up spending a lot of time together. Speak the same languages, same race, and I’m sure there are more obvious reasons that could be added.
So awkward yet amusing
After watching Sharla for at least the past 8 years and throughout her previous relationship, I remember a lot of her followers attempted to guess who she was engaged to for the longest time until she revealed she was moving to Korea. Then one day your video from JAJ popped up featuring her, and I was SHOCKED. She never seemed to be as happy with her ex as she is with you, even without seeing him on the screen (no tea no shade here lol). That was before you were even dating apparently! I love to see that. I've been an avid fan of yours ever since then, and you are 100% my husbands British doppelganger, and now he watches your videos with me! Much love to both of you and positive vibes towards a fantastic relationship. I'm really looking forward to the collabs!
Pfft....if this dating stuff makes you less jaded and miserable i will be extremely disappointed.  Only kidding, pleased for you both. Though i think even Stevie Wonder saw this coming 😎🤣
wait how did i knew since they did the noodle challenge with connor she looked like a supportive gf it seems so clear to me
Not surprising people thought you were gay you guys were queerbaiting a little 😉
I wish my dust allergy would go away but no matter how much I expose myself to it it's still terrible 🤔😩
OMG YAS! :D
Blimey, Connor's gonna be gutted, he's so obviously in love with you!! 🤣 Congrats. 😊
Glad to hear pete is okay, didn't know he was in hospital. Super Happy for you and Sharla, also for you and the cats. I believe you can grow tolerant of cat allergies if you spend enough time with them, but im no expert.
what a title for a video xD
Chris thanks for confirming you don't touch cats. Keep it that way.
CONGRATSSSSSSSSS
Congratz Chris, super happy for you both! Much love from Norway! ❤️
Pete impression was on point!
Punching above your weight Chris!!!!! Nice one.😁
I Knew it!! This video made me grin like a mad women, happy for you guys!
yayyyy ❤️
Big congrats to you and Sharla! 🥂✨💜 You guys are so cute together, and I can’t wait for y’all to take us on a date 😂  Btw I’m allergic to my cat and my dog, so I adapted to their fur and took some allergy pills lol Overtime my allergies did get better! I only have to wash my hands after I pet them, make sure I don’t accidentally rub my eyes after touching them, and most importantly… CLEAN the house and my bed sheets weekly 😂😭 The cleaner the house, the easier it is to live with animal fur lol
What's better than being in a relationship is finally being able to be around cats.
I'm so happy for you guys
Congratulations Chris! You did well.
Hey Chris you gotta admit you spend a lot of time in the tub with Connor, LOL. Yeah not much benifit to Canada these days, you're better off in Japan. Well I'm glad you guys got together, good to have someone that you love to spend time with and who has your back. Good on ya bud!
I don’t wanna be that guy BUT I felt this coming! Congrats!!
I wonder if Merrow will become the ramen shop lucky cat now. I can just see him curled up on the bar like “I am waiting for service human!”
Congratulations Chris. Your private life is your business not for others to judge just be happy and keep those videos coming.
The Pete accent was on point
Not surprising. I was wondering when it will be announced officially. If you haven't been dating yet, when i thought you were, then i just new it's gonna happen some day. Good couple. Best of luck.
You still spent more on the halloween costume than Connor on his cosplays.
Sound advice on romance - always friends first.  Which is why I shall forever be single because all my guy friends are married or gay.
"Sucks to be Connor"? What? He has Ironmouse!
I'm allergic to cats. We have four of them. (At some point, we had five, which arguably is a lot.) You'll get used to it, although antihistamines might be an idea.
You guys (in the comments) are really bad at reading Chris' trolling.  Also Sharla was talking in her video about dating someone especially pointing for you that it is NOT Chris.  So calm down. 😄
Fabulous news Kurissu-san!!! Looking forward to seeing your future video collabs together.
WHOLESOME! ❤️
I thought Sharla was being sarcastic 😅
👍
God bless the both of you an i hope you have a wonderful life together❤️
the only thing i gained from this video is that Chris has a great Pete impression  3:56
I think people only thought Chris and Connor were dating was because Chris said that they were dating
My aunt had a cat allergy but she got over it when she got a cat, so I think this will benefit you in a way. Happy about you guys, tho kinda surprised. Wish you the best and it was a wise move to not publicize relationship early on, so I think you guys got it! Savor these moments!!!
You're telling me she's cracked the code to fix Japan's Fried Chicken Man's diet???
The "I'm not gay!" while wearing a glasses flashing in the colors of the rainbow got me :D
I did wonder when you were all in the UK at the same time! Lovely news …
you both match, like both big boned... i thought she would be with norman but he is skinny
cut the carbs eat more meat
Is she "Canadian guy" from your early videos?
THIS IS THE BEST TIMELINE. CONGRATS MATE!!!
Congratulations Chris everyone is rooting for you
That impression of American Pete was perfect
huh chris is adapting the take the live stream and put it in my second channel strat
I love this, Chris and Sharla always have a great chemistry and I’m looking forward to seeing more of you I love your videos together😁
Not gay? What are you? Homophobic? LOL, just kidding man! Congrats.
Where'd the full vod go? I was in the middle of watching it and it disappeared
You're both good looking people with great personalities so I'm happy for this :D
Very happy for you both! :)
what about risottoro
First of all congratulations guys.  I suppose staying in lovehotels with Connor might be the explanation for all the comments.
7:00 CHRIS WAS ALWAYS A LOOKER KING
I hope this is the last we hear of this. Date who you want, I don’t think I need to know. Just make interesting videos and leave it at that please
As someone from the UK and born in the 90's, The phrase "I'm not gay but my boyfriend is"   But if connor is a boy and friend that by very definition means he is a "boyfriend"   Because in the UK, Au, Nz, Ca,  We are all commonwealth citizens with the same big old liz on some money,   We all know that before you even to be a boyfriend or girlfriend to someone that you care so much for, You have to be an amazing friend first as it's in the title of "Boyfriend"  "Girlfriend",    Because how can you love someone if you don't trust them first,
HAHAHAHAHAHA...Dating Connor and Gay....OMG
Congrats to both of you! Wishing a happy and prosperous life together 🥹🙏🏻💚
He's not gay, just affable.
-trying not to overreact- -trying not to overreact- AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~~!!!!! I can't believe this is actually happeningggggggg~!!!! Congrats, Chris and Sharla!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
When The Wall hits, the chubby friend conveniently becomes a "Great Match".
Chris, how could you? What about us?! *Slow motion cry-run*.
Cute….. love it 🥰
It’s abute time. Got to be a few of these right?
lol. you look like elon musk :D
Congrats to you both <3 I had a huge grin when Sharla made the announcement. 😁My partner and I have been together for 10 yrs and we started off as friends as well. We just got married like 2 months ago. 😊
Congratulations! 💖
I legitimately thought it was all a gag. Her response on stream, the (reaction video), I thought she was joking and people were dragging it out. I wish you two all the best of luck in your relationship.   Also Connor cant be with Chris...It'd break IronMouse's heart XD
LESSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO this is like that time Goku defeated Frieza
This is so sweet. I sincerely wish both of you the very best and lots and lots of happiness!
I knew it! I friggin knew it! I could sense the "sexual" tension between you guys every time I saw you on screen together😊 Congrats to you both!
Abroad in Canada won’t be as exciting as its basically if US and UK had a baby
Video title: why I'm dating a Canadian Me a Canadian: uh cause we're nice? Cause we're hot? Cause we like plaid? No other reasons necessary.
Congrats!! I wish you two the best!
Just to make sure there are no false rumors, i haven’t dated  Chris ever!
iirc you were bragging that you were higher ranked at celebrity birthday than her :3
This is amazing! This has made my day! Congrats to you both!
Kinda knew this was coming since the bike trip
I'm genuinely happy for you mate . hope you and  @Sharmeleon wil have a long and happy relationship together
Guys. Let's all try and stop thinking that mistaking someone for being gay is a negative thing or an insult, when in reality it's basically the same as saying "oh I always thought you had darker hair". Other than that, awesome news, now Chris and Sharla can both take care of Monke as surrogate mum and dad and make him shower :p
I'm pretty allergic to cats too. However she had cats when we started dating and after moving in my allergies went from manageable with daily Reactine pills to hardly any drugs at all, (maybe 1 every couple weeks if I had a reaction). Which is a good thing because I love cats and would absolutely snuggle them to my face relentlessly until my eyes swelled up and call it 100% worth it. And then when the last of the cats died I was at a point where I could not tell the difference (medically) between when they were around and when they weren't. So yeah you can adapt to an animal you allergic to, that said I was really only adapted to the cats I lived with. Other cats still set off some breathing difficulty and watery eyes.
im so stupid i can't understand if this is a prank . yet i knew that the whole "romantic date" joke thing on wacky weekend was obviously a joke
I don’t know why, but for some reason I thought Chris was already married.
ITS ABOUT TIME SON. BEEN WANTING YALL TO DO THAT FOR YEARS
So happy for you and Sharla! She seems quite lovely, and you are the most affable, you deserve each other. I have only seen a couple of her videos but I’ll have to go check out her channel more. Much love to you both 💜
iI was always a no brainer why he dint date sharla
Where has Ryotaro been? Are you guys no longer friends?
Benefits of dating a Canadian must surely include Tim Hortons discounts...otherwise what's the point?
Holy Hell, i never would have guessed, you two are perfect for each other. and you and Connor are more of a bromance thing, like JD and Turk from Scrubs.....
Besides us canucks being even nicer to you then normal until we are not... nope nothing. Thou I'm not sure if anyone can handle us hosers being even nicer then we stereotypically are, eh.
Congratulations! I’m relieved that the two of you took your time. Establishing a relationship outside of the public eye was very wise. You took the right steps. The friendship you share was always a great highlight to your videos and beyond the flood of these adulations, never let anything, including your relationship get in the way of your friendship. If you maintain that… the two of your will be perfectly fine.  /cheers folks.
"I guess it kinda went from there really" - the most puzzling (and the most interesting) part gets the most ambiguous description. :D Otherwise, just one more comment that's happy for you. Yeay Chris+Sharla!  Btw, for what it's worth, I didn't think that you're gay Chris. But, being friends with Connor? There's no strategic maple syrup reserve in Wales, so there's just no justifying this...
I’m screaming!!!!! You guy def had chemistry in your videos!!!!!
yessss, more collab videos of chris with sharla.
Well she certainly did put a lot of work into that chocolate orange
long haired cats are often less bad for allergies and more exposure helps as well
Very cool Chris 😎
I have been shipping this for a long long time....I'm more excited than I should be lol.  Nothing but good vibes and best wishes to you both.
I have been watching Sharla for the last 4 or 5 years (Literally just about every video) and was so chuffed at this announcement! Congrats to you both!
Chris: try dating a friend   Me: *gets friend zoned*  (Happy for you Chris Borad)
The main benefit to dating someone from Canada is that we're all beautiful and kind.
Don't cut the meat, Chris. Please, please research the need for all the nutrients found in animal products.
Obvious is obvious. At least I can say congrats now!
I'm like 99% sure most people were just riding the joke/meme about Connor and any attached implication to you that it has. That said, yeah, there were probably a lot of people who weren't in on the joke. I don't think it'll take much to get those people to know the truth, but yeah. The jokes will probably die off almost entirely in the coming months, but not completely. It can still be funny from time to time maybe.
So happy for you! I always thought you two would be a good couple, and already guessed a long time ago that something might be going on... wish you lots of happy years together.
Love Sharla but i secretly hoped it would be Emma just for the back and forth banter you guys have lol
I’m happy for you bro! Looking forward to what the future brings for you both!
oooo somone has a girlfriend
I remember seeing comments on the videos with Sharla in on the first Journey Across Japan saying how are you two not dating due your chemistry.
🎉❤️
We are proud Mr VIP de Big
So when will there be a couples dinner at Rachel and June's new house?
your impression of PremierTwo is surprisingly accurate
I never thought you and Connor have a thing 🤷🏻  Congratulations to both of you. I hope you guys have a happy, healthy and lovely relationship for years to come. May you be blessed.
To think people care so much about who someone they watch videos of is dating. Just show us around Japan, that's what we're here for.
Natsuki when you don't pick up his call "Go fuck yoursellfff"
yeah bud I'm sure your girlfriend's from Canada, mine is just out of town today at her nephews birthday party with her friends at a mall
The chemistry was so undeniable it was visible in videos. Happy for you two 👍🏼
New side channel? AbroadinSharla? xD
"He's not gay, he's British!"
Finally!! Saw it coming for so long.
It's great to see you happy. I hope this works out for the both of you.  Also, let this be further motivation for you to get healthy and fit.
Good now the Connor ship can go away.
You make a lovely couple and I wish you both every happiness.  Apparently I know nothing about relationships just ask my wife of 35yrs...
Great news! I'm happy for you! Now I'm the only one who's alone :/
Kinda obvious. Congrats you two!
You won't get allergies from Maro and Tuna, for they are both two adorable eldritch entities disguised as cats :P
I ended up dating a friend. Over a decade later he's my best friend and my husband and I wouldn't give him up for anything.
I knew you'd yank this clip for views lol
You'll love Banff.  I live in Calgary (about an hour away from Banff).  All the best to you two.
1:43 Woo, Chris knows what to say to -keep- his girlfriend.
WOW, Good job, im happy for you. Sharla is a cutie pie,,,
Congratulations Chris I’m happy for you two.  You both look like a great match together.  I know a lot of people like to ship two men who are obviously good friends together without context. I hear is something like a gay relationship looks more wholesome or something like that I don’t know. It’s not your fault. I feel as a lot of guys get shipped together with their friends me included.  Congratulations again on your relationship. Cheers!!!
Well done lad. She's a keeper.
My boyfriend and I started out as friends and then a year or so into the friendship we started dating. Will be 2 years this Aug 💜💜
Yes the ship sailed baby!!!
What is the Queen going to think?
YOU'RE DATING CHRIS?!
YASSSS so happy that sharla who i have been watching since she moved to japan :o im so happy to see her happy and im so happy its with you!! I initially found sharla and i recently found your channel and love it :)
About the cat allergy... some breeds are also more likely to cause alergies compared to others! My mom is alergic to my cats but not to her cat 🤷‍♀️
Who could have seen this coming?!?
The candyman costume story 😹
Congratulations!
now I can't wait for their next collab vlog
I knew it lol
Nice
I could seriously feel the chemistry between you two from behind the screen from the first time I saw you two together on Chris's videos. You two really work in that odd way that potentially long term partners do .. She can be really nice and smiley but deep down is super sarcastic and cynical. Chris can be grumpy and cynical on the outside but inside is a really positive and friendly person overall. It really works, happy for you guys! :D
Congrats!
You look like a british couple as is
In my family we are allergic to outside cats but not inside cats, they may just roll around in something idk
It's so lovely after years of seeing you two with such great chemistry
Best wishes !
My partner and I are about break up so this gives me hope that love exists 😭😭
I remember the chemistry of you both being very evident in the 'cycle around a lake near Mount Fuji' video  (cant remember the name)  Wishing you both happiness and good luck
Chris isn't gay, he's just British. Very easy mistake to make. Also RIP Connor.
Hope it moves forward! Cute couple!!!
"why i'm dating a canadian" ....because both of you like each other and both want ....🤷‍♀️  i don't get why people get into who is dating who.🤦‍♀️
Lol not a surprise at all :D But congrats you guys! <3
You can build immunity to allergies with cats. I was highly allergic as a kid but we got our first one when I was 4 and I acclimated really quickly and only periodically have itchy eyes now as an adult
"apples, innit?" also i've seen that pic of chris and connor with the fried chicken a bunch before but never noticed the strange growth on that french fry did you eat it? did connor eat it?
The allergy to specific cats can go down! My partner is very allergic to cats... But my two he's okay with now! Other cats still bother him
Wishing you a happy life together!
THANK YOU GOD, AND I MEAN IT FROM OUR HEARTS 💕 💕
Alright, man. Congrats!!
Mad respect for building the relationship privately before going public with it. IMO it's the smart move for sure, just because relationships by nature are messy. Im very happy to hear it's been a happy, healthy relationship so far!
Long story short, the mad lad made it out of the friend zone, Mr. AFFABLE strikes again
YEAHHHH!!!! LETS GOOO BABYYYYY THIS IS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT WOOO HOOO YEAHHH!!
The trash taste squad being so genuinely happy for Chris is the best part. Pure happiness and excitement
So, cats, no meat and a shine in your eyes. Maybe time to check if you don't have a concussion?
Is there some kind of rift between Chris and Garnt? Chris wasn’t invited to his wedding and Chris didn’t even suggest Garnt as a best man.
Good for you Mate. You found Love. Sorry, that I have to spoil your happiness. Love is overrated! You will see..........
Yes! I've been waiting for this. I've felt you two were perfect together since the biking videos.
Okay, but can we talk about how good Chris's Pete impression was?
Aww I’m so happy for you guys 🥺😋🖤
When this announcement happened, it literally made my whole year. I bought a big house with multiple acres of land and this is still the best news. Im so unbelievably happy for you two, and wish you both well.   Please make babies :)
Why I'm dating a Canadian cuz both r made 4 each other ugly as hell I'm cartoon😂😂😂😂
I've known many people and myself included who are of the O blood type and have a difficult time cutting out meat entirely. Supplements included
Somebody knows from what video or videos the boys reaction really are?
I can’t tell you how happy I am that two lovely people have found happiness. I knew you two had amazing chemistry for years, but never was so presumptuous to vocalise it, because I don’t like when people do that to me. Secretly I hoped you both were dating, and happy.
Low key, I kinda thought Chris was maaaaybe gay 😂
How does Sharla feel you calling her Cat "ChewNa"?
I'm dying of laughter the fact that some people actually thought you and Connor were dating hahahaha. Jeez some people can't differentiate between memeing/joking about it and actually being serious. I'm just glad Chris is comfortable with his sexuality and can joke about things like that thus making better content. <3
Congratulations Chris!! when I watched the First journey across Japan I said to my friend bet they date in a few years 😂😂
Poor Connor
Whaaaaaatttttt I taught you were gay. 💔💔💔💔
(pretending to be blind over the past few years) what a revelation this is, who could've saw this coming lol!
We’ve known for yearssss glad she decided to finally announce it though!!
So connor been a third wheel the whole time?
Allergies CAN go away if you get used to it, but it can also get worse. It's kind of a coinflip. There's also certain cats you can be less allergic too than others. It's great news Chris is not getting allergic reactions to them though
Whaaaa Pete!? Get well soon dude 🙏 I fear random crap like appendix issues
“Maybe we gave off those vibes”, regarding you and Connor, NO you really DIDN’T gave off any vibes. Some people on the internet are just stupid.
Don’t start cooking for this marshmallow man, Sharla !! ;)
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Very nice 👍 👏 😀 that butt 👌 10 outta 10 all jokes aside I knew it >_> ever since the journey across Japan cycling episodes.
I never knew connor was Canadian
So this means Sharla was the broad in Japan all along?
My mans moved to Japan to get with the only non-japanese girl lol.
Oh. My. God. The cat Tuna looks exactly like our cat Mia. Like. Even the wary look. It's uncanny.
Yaaay Chris finally got a gf
You don't run away from your allergies, you fight them till your body adapts.
All those "poor Connor" comments... I thought he had maybe talked about being into Sharla... He fancied some girl who moved away, but came back, and people had figured it out... I don't know. Didn't think people meant "poor Connor" because Chris was now taken :P
Dude I always assumed you guys were dating then I got surprised you never were?? Now it all makes sense
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Congrats! So glad that you two are happy together 🎉
Congrats and all, of course, but I just hafta say these AiJ and related posts are getting a bit gaijin-heavy. Just sayin’.
the ending is insane!!! so goooooooood
This was quite a shitty video, but it made me so happy.  It’s so good to see how happy you are!
so happy for you chris!
I have wondered for a LONG TIME how you two weren't a couple..... Love it! 😍And yes, you build up an "immunity" to a cat. It took me about 4 months with my first cat..... so happy for you two!
Duh English guys are like catnip to Canadian women.   Seriously guys if you're English move to Canada, if you're a 5/10 in England you will be a 7/10 in Canada.
If you go to Banff, be sure to go to Lake Louise! But be prepared to wake up super early to get a parking spot, or you can park and take a bus in. There are so many other beautiful lakes there too, but Lake Louise is a favorite for a reason!
With cat allergies they can develop over time suddenly or they can dissipate over time suddenly. Also some breads can be better or worse for allergies depending on their dandruff.
Yo, glad for you two, hope you'll have amazing adventures together ^^ PS: Connor is a dirty boi x'D
No one with half a brain thought you were gay as it was obviously just brotherly banter between you and Connor.  Hope you guys make some cool videos in BC one day (I'm in Victoria as well!)
Congrats. It was very smart of you guys to keep it private for a while. Hope it works out. Like anything remember a relationship does require work.. My better half and I have been married 37 years.
POOR CONNOR!
I'm confused, based on her video I thought she was completely joking (the boys video didn't help) are you guys ACTUALLY dating
Omg I am so so happy for you guys!!! Not that I haven't shipped you 2 since like 2018 😁
I TOUGHT THAT WAS ACTUALLY A JOKE OMG😂 Thats amazing guys good luck for the future 🤞🏼💯🙌🏽
I had a feeling there was something there! I love both of your channels and hope to see more of you two together in future videos.
obviously Sharla and Chris are dating. Girls have a thing for guys with a big studio ;)
As a man that lost hope in love for 7 years of toxic relationship, you reminded me back when i first sweeted on a girl. I just miss the feeling of first love, but as i traveled though hardship i can't crush on any body or try and risk finding another person that i could love.
It's unfortunate that some people lose their friendships when they end up confessing and prompting for a relationship, but if you're ever gonna want something everlasting this is the most sensible way to go as Chris and Sharla ended up practicing (and so many people in the comments as well it seems).
Can attest I was also pretty allergic to cat, but it got better and now I'm all good. It can be rough for a bit, but you adapt, it's fine.
That Pete impression was pretty good lol
"Oh my God, what's Connor gonna do" HAHAHAHAHA LMAO
…sooo, you’ve been dating at least six weeks cause the cat allergy is gone. 🤔🐈😂 Seriously though, I’m so happy for you guys! ☺️
Oh Em Gee I remember that costume 😂😂😂
This was Chris's coming out as straight video, and honestly I think he is really brave for doing this. You go Chris! I respect and support you no matter your sexuality!
People really trolled Chris and Connor to the point that he thought some of his audience actually believed him to be gay. They were most definitely just trolling Chris, nobody actually thinks you're gay.  It's great to hear that you're trying to eat healthier, but cutting out meat ≠ eating healthier. Just try and cut back on all the processed and fried stuff along with watching your sugar and carb intake and that should be a move in a better direction.
Sharla said she was in the UK for a wedding, I suspected that it was Garnt and Sydney's wedding, but now that we know Sharla and Chris have been dating for a while, and the fact that we _know_ Chris was there, I'm now 98.93% sure that Sharla was in the UK for Garnt and Sydney's wedding. The only question is, did Sharla get as trashed as Chris, Connor, or even as fucking gone as Joey was?  Also, we all know Ryotaro Sakurai would be Chris Broad's best man, and Natsuki would be a groomsman.
Because maple syrup is sticky ;)
You do well together, hopefully it lasts. Both channels are fascinating to watch.
I knew this the minute she said she was going to the UK for a month. Always seen the chemistry there. So happy you've chosen a fellow Canadian! We make awesome girlfriends. Love you both!
Congratulations
No Chris, you never gave off any Gay "Vibes". It's just that weebs these days are completely retarded towards that, specially girl weebs. They'll spend half an hour saying how men and women can be just friends to justify the bunch of men they keep around for attention, but then wet themselves the moment two straight bros share a room or act friendly towards one another in any piece of media.
Met my husband via a mutual friend and we all hung out in a larger friend group for months then we started hanging out just us two. Been together for 16 years, married for 10. Starting as friends is best!
“She’s not lying” 😂😂😂
Bruh
I thought the Connor bromance was forever 😣. I’m so upset. You seemed so good together.
Chris Broad: "It's been a great relationship"
There's nothing gay about two men holding hands, just sayin'
CALLED IT! Awesome! :)
Cheers to you guys! <3  (I'm cat allergic, but have 3 cats :) I get only little things from other cats now, but my own are ok ! )
Man i'm so happy about this, yall have great chemistry on camera, glad it carries over to off camera too. Hopefully we get to see more content of them together.
Maple reserves, innit.
I could have sworn Chris and Conner have said in every love hotel review that they aren't gay
Why you're not dating Connor? You're made to each other 💓💓💞💞💝💝
aww you and sharla are so adorable together !!
Even blind ppl saw this coming - good for you Chris....now don't change your fun relationship because it being 'more serious'...good luck!
Good luck brother, you're the goat
I don’t know why this came out of left field for me… but congrats!
Somehow friends to dating never works for me despite being on the interested end 💔😅 Maybe someday, this is hopeful 🥰
Eat whole foods( in regards to the diet)
Finally! Congrats to both of you ❤️ Good job👏
Yes but what does Sharla think of you being a fat bastard? xD Joking, mate... Real chuffed about this! I'd say this is a good chance to eat better, eat less and sleep better - I found out a combo of all three helps hugely in losing weight (outside exercising). And yes, you're right in your other video about 'biggest lies'  - eating well probably means avoiding a lot of the Japanese salty food with carbs and focusing maybe more on a classic Mediterranean diet, meaning mostly fruit and veg, lots of legumes and olive oil (or something similar, yes Sharla seems to be in the right direction in terms of eating well). Cheers!
i was waiting for you to find this edited video!!!!!🤣 All the best to you guys.
The title of this is hilarious 😂
They're magical cats Chris.
Aww, love you two. Totally thought you were gay.
Couldn't be more happier for you too, hope it continues to go well! I think a lot surrounding the 2 min mark has a lot to do with the teasing and joking thats been prevalent and some actually believing it or not knowing when to quit. I get its fun to josh and kid around, but people should be more mindful not to be taking jokes to far which it seems to be doing. Like with "Septiplier". It can cause more harm than good for peoples personal lives and mental state even if its not addressed. Anyway, congrads and best wishes!
ok, so step 1: find a friend.   whelp looks like this is a big "L"
So many Connor x Chris shippers are crying right now because their dreams have been shattered.   I'm happy for you both, Chris. Hope good things come your way. Pretty sure Connor is cheering you on as well, or weeping because this means he can't go to love hotels with you as often anymore.
I am happy for you Chris! Yes I am deathly allergic cats, and I am a chronic asthma so I always have to use an inhaler.    2020 I found a cat in my driveway eating cat food I leave for the strays.  Next day his leg was up so I assumed he hurt inside.  The rest was history, I suffered a lot but about 3 months later I was fine.
That's so cute, all the best for you :)
Congratulations Mr.Abroad!
Oh i see: this relationship is cat-approved. It has to be a sign, if his allergies calm down around her cats. Best wishes for you two.
I know this is private info but if they want to share, I want to know how long a while is lol. I mean its just the romantic in me that wants to know the love story, like how you guys got together! Also so we can go back to you guy’s vids and see if we can tell that the dynamic changed. Lol 😝
Congratulations! You did the right thing that you didn’t say anything, after all, it’s private in my opinion. In general, I always have fun and enjoy your videos, I learn about Japan until I'll visit one day. And please invite more your senpai Ryotaro.
I've watched you for years, waiting for love to find you. I mean, you are cute, super intelligent, well spoken, personable... My mom side is giddy! Now I know you're ok, I can stop watching. 😜😄
And thus, two legends joined a story togheter
Happy for both of you! Congratulations! 🙂♥️
I always thought you two had great chemistry on screen.  So glad you've made it official.  Much happiness to you both!
I’m happy to see you guys dating! 😍🥰
You guys definitely make a good couple, I always thought you guys looked good together and you seems to have good alchemy, no wonder, most of the time you were already dating. But even on journey across jaspan, the first one, the bit with the bridge where you and sharla bike together, I could already sens a good alchemy going.
I always new our boy Chris could do it 🥳
It's been pretty obvious for a while. Amusing that so many people still hadn't guessed it.
You don't need to be gay to date a guy 🤷🏼‍♂ Let go of labels  But also I clearly remember you mentioning that you were taking extra Japanese classes to improve your chances in the dating scene... Funny how that turned out
I could tell they were dating from the way they were interacting in their videos by the subtle affection they had.
Never been too comfortable knowing too much about the personal lives of content creators, but I wish you both well, simply as two decent people who've given a lot of us out there many hours of delight.  Also, our syrup reserves can be traded on a kg-for-kg basis for wagyu or tuna. 😉
Congrats Chris! That's amazing news!
The slice of life we didn't know was happening.  When's the first volume 👀
I’m a Canadian. If things don’t work out Chris , I’ve always wanted to live in Japan. Also I live about an hour away from Banff. I can give you a tour
Chris:” I’m not gay”  Chris:* Wears a multicolored rainbow headband throughout the entirety of the video*
I, like so many others, knew something was going on between the two of you when Sharla was in England  at the same time as your trip to the UK.
Such a cute couple! Best wishes, you too!
As much as I really want their relationship to last it kinda feels like it won’t last. Let’s hope I’m wrong though.
Chris you have to make Shinzo Abe proud Chris you have to repopulate Japan
Genuinely thought that was piss take from sharla lol
I always said they'd make a great pair !!!  IM SHOCKED! But also happy.
LETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
omg..... chris has truetone on on his iphone... disgusting.
Happy for you dude. You two always seemed to mesh off each other well in videos. Hope all goes well for you guys. Also I came for a maple syrup joke and didn't leave disappointed!
I’m really happy for you Chris. Take care!
Pete's impression was incredible
So happy for our Japan darlings 😁🎉 totally unrelated but, does anyone know where to snag the bomb ass track at the end of the video?
I think your audience was very excited about the news, due to the great chemistry Sharla and you have had over the years. We could all sense or intuit something based on how often you both mentioned each other unprompted in your respective videos. I'm happy for you both and wish you a long (maybe permanent ?) and happy relationship.
You’re a toy boy bruv! Happy for you guys ❤️
i thought Sharla was just trolling
Rest in peace "ironmouse is Chris Broad" meme. It was fun while it lasted.
love that randomly placed thrust master airbus
With the cat allergy, I find that the cleaner people keep their living space with the cat, the easier the allergies are. And it seems, based on Sharla's videos, that she is pretty good at cleaning up fur and such around her apartment, so your story makes sense. And there def is truth to getting used to the cat you're around a lot for sure.
Are you dating Connor
I’m so happy for you, Chris 🥰 Sharla’s amazing and you both definitely deserve the best. I’ve always had a feeling about you two. You have great chemistry. And hearing you say that you can visit her family in Canada ☺️ I hope you have a long, healthy, happy relationship together
I always love that Connor clip cause Ironmouse cheering in the background is so wholesome
I had no idea and I think it's awesome they've been able to keep it mostly private to avoid rough situations. Really cool to hear, both channels are so great. I love that clip at the beginning ironmouse in the background is so funny. I hope everything works out great.
Congrats Chris!
I'm happy for you
It's weird how people seem to date within the same career pool, even where the career is unusual. Congrats on finding someone that mostly I assume puts up with you! It's definitely better than not having that.
All the comments are going to be about Chris and Sharla but I’m here to tell you that Pete impression at 3:57 was flawless.
Congrats to both of you.
In one video you referred to Connor as your boyfriend, so I think that's where those comments came from.
Because Canada.🍁
This video should've been 5 seconds long "why am I dating Sharla? Because I fkn want to" why is everyone so nosey
Chris and Conner aren't gay their Eruopean!
Been pretty obvious for a coupleyears. And oh my god, who is connorgonna date ?
Connor doesn't shower? I don't know if that was a joke or not, but I completely believe it and refuse to be convinced otherwise.
All the best, in Japanese.
I CALLED THIS SINCE THE FIRST TIME SHARLA WAS IN A VIDEO
Aw. This makes me very happy. You’re both very lovely and lucky ❤️
Dude I honestly thought your gay. Wow and she's hot! Congratulations man.
HOME WRECKER!
Omg!
This video is great & kinda heartwarming - love how you talk about her, makes me smile
Babbabooi
Because Chris asked her and it would have been rude to say "No"
I always thought Sharla was scookum.  I wish you both the best.
Abroad in Canada!
I fucking knew it!
Great news. I am so happy. Wish You two all the best!
Congrats chris on punching up! I honestly thought the two  of your were dating since watching the Japanese Burger King video, the two of you have great chemistry on camera im sure off camera its a little slice of heaven.
I don't have friends what do I dooo
Congrats to you both!!! Can't wait for your upcoming videos, my wife and I both truly enjoy them. Question, is there any chance you would ever cover the Tanabata Festival in Sendai?
i dont care about the relationship im just excited for possibly more content of Sharla's cats.
I was so upset about the comments in the clip on youtube that were so judgmental of her or protective of you and like... they all need to bug off. It's between the two of you and none of the viewers have a say. I wish you both the best ♥
I thought you were getting soft on you videos the past three months.  I now know why.
Is this sarcasm? Isn't sharla a little bit idk to young for Chris?
Mate, we all knew lol
i’m married to Canadian woman. I have been for over 12 years. The only bitch is Visas :(
natsuki your best man? r u sure? imagine your stag do....not sure i know what a traditional japanese stag do is, probably drinking and kareoke .....but r u sure youd make it to the wedding in one piece? he'd probably pull a natsuki and youd end up tied to the north pole with a bow on your 🍆 and a fresh new hair do in rainbow colours. live streamed!   i cant possibly imagine how crazy it would end up!
I got you hes just a sad piece
Glad you two are happy! :D
I think you can actually like build up a tolerance to whatever you are allergic, like with me and milk, i used to have these ungodly and horrific toilet sessions My love for dairy is stronger than the shits i have
Lmbooo was this a real reaction though lmboo they’re too much😂😂😂
Dating a Canadian!? What's all this aboot??
Hey Chris, what is it like dating a vegan?
there could not have been a better way to start this video LMAO
As a Canadian, I can assure you there is nothing going on here.
Look at that cheek flush.... lol
Chris literally telling us to break out the friend zone.
Chris dating an onee-san 👍
I love this for you guys so much TT u TT
Also agree about the being friends first. I met my husband in high school at 15/16 and we are both 31 now and have been married for 10 years. 💖
Hey Chris, I also have an allergy to cat fur. However, I also own 2 cats. You will find that you build up a tolerance to cat fur with continuous exposure. That being said, if you are away from those cats for several days or longer, you may find your tolerance has dropped, resulting in itching or swelling. In that case, you will need to rebuild your tolerance again.
Cheers to you and your relationship :)
Mr and Miss Affable
So happy for you two! You make a great couple and have a lot of chemistry 👍
Six, seven months ago during the soba noodle challenge video it was obvious you guys were dating. You guys just fit together well. Congrats!
wasn't it obvious considering Sharla was camerawomen for some of hes big trip videos.
I just love this pairing they are literally my two faves so I’m so happy for them both ❤️
I really do think that Chris should be a voice actor! He's impression of Pete really sounded like him! Very accurate for sure!
O_o how could anyone think chris is gay... sorry but my gaydar didn't explode at ALL (with conner though... hmm)
I'm not gay! Wearing the gayest headband ever. Lol
My husband was also allergic to cats but after we got a cat his allergies went away. I am glad you also adjusted! 🐱
Was i the only one who thought Chris and cdawg were secretly gay for eachother
Lol you cant have a "just friends" relationship like that to the opposite sex. That does not exist. But you did good by taking it slow and natural. Especially about the official announcement part.
Finally yall are dating!!🤗 Congrats💕
The title of this alone kills me, like dating a Canadian has to be justified lol. Anyways y’all are cute together!
Saw this coming ever since Chris crashed while Sharla was biking in front of him
Took me a roommate with eight cats to get over my allergy, but now years later I have three of my own and I’ve completely forgotten that I ever had an allergy
They say all allergies change every 7 years or so. Also, congrats on getting a fine Canadian girl. They are the best!
Pete impression is on point!
“No… Sharla and I weren’t dating while filming ‘Journey Across Japan I’”- meaning they were dating during “Journey Across Japan I”.  Also, FYI- if you think Chris is fat now, just imagine him after a steady diet of poutine and moose testicles.
Finally!!! :D
I always took Connor as the type to have poor hygiene so it’s relieving I can now shred my girlfriends for simping over the  smelly mess of a man I always knew Connor to be XD
If he moves to Canada he'll have to change his channel to Chris in Canada!
Chris will become "THE BURGLAR OF BANFF" !......So sayeth the recently passed on Good Ghost of LARRY STORCH from his "F-Troop" days.
This literally doesn't change my life. Congrats tho.
I’m so happy for u. Watching u for years and seeing this makes me happy best wishes and a lot of love
I already know the answer before watching this video.  As a fellow Canadian we're awesome, and Sharla seems so down to earth.  Nice to hear you have each other.  take care :)
Cool Cyber-glasses Chris.
Sharla already said she fell in love with Chris after the smash hit “Too Much Volcano!”.  Quite understandable, really.
I feel like chris has aged backwards since he started to hang out with the boys and stream more.
Gants reaction is more for attention than actual surprise, typical dipshit move so expected of him.
A canadian? A canadian?           Good job and glad its working for you guys😎
Your Pete impression was spot on ahahah. Congrats Chris!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!
:0 happy for you both
That is sooooo cute see Chris so flushed about this 🥰
You guys compliment each other, hope one day you guys get married if it works out
Thanks for talking about this.  I’m proud of you.  I had my cat allergy my whole life.  Dammit.  I like cats but my eyes swell shut and I can’t breathe.   Been to Banff a lot.  It’s amazing.  Especially if you ski. I would love to live in Canada but getting citizenship is more difficult than the US. Just cut out carbs.  Sharla has to do that anyway.
I KNEW IT! From the very start I saw her looking at you in a very interesting way. Obviously you're a very funny and charming gentlemen so I have no doubt about it that she made a good choice 😊
i dont normally comment on any youtube videos but i am BEYOND happy for the two of you. its so cool to see yall together. i wish yall nothing but the best and lots of love <3
People have been shipping male friends together without any actual context for a long time now, Chris. It’s not your fault. XD And I’d say most people making these comments are joking, but that certainly doesn’t apply to everyone. 😂  What does apply to everyone, or it should, is that we’re all very happy for you two. ❤️
Connor instantly becoming a meme 🤣
As someone who lives in Canada, Japan is what I would pick too.
This makes me smile so much
Funny how your first issue with Connor is that he doesnt bath, and your next one is that you are not gay hahahahaha it shouldve been first, im not gay and second he doesnt shower hahahaz
Always thought you guys had AMAZING chemistry! So happy for you guys!
Cheers bro, so happy to hear this.
I mean congrats and all that, but we gotta talk about that Pete impression, it was like hes still there playing cyberpunk🍗
Aah, yes. The moment I’ve been waiting for since the Valentines Chocolate challenge episode. 😌
Man this is great news, im happy for Chris. I think I knew for a while though. There's little signs, I think, that you can see in their interactions. Anyways, can't wait for the new Journey Across Japan. I know it'll be amazing.
Weed, That's what's going on in Canada, tons of Weed, everyone is growing, everyone is vaping, everyone is doing edibles and stoned to the gills and it's awesome!!!
Now I kinda want to see the timeline where Connor and Chris end up going out because Connor decided to shower regularly 🤣
Would be crazy if you moved to my hood of Vancouver.
Definitely not for me
Good grooming more important than sexual orientation.
Yes!!!!
British Imperialism strikes again
Congrats ya'll
I KNEW IT! THE WAY YOU LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN YOUR VIDS TELLS IT ALL! LOL.
Damn, i thought it was a joke.
You're a british, and she's a canadian, this love shouldn't have exist👺
I agree with you Chris. Dating a friend makes relationships last cause i get to know them more first.
saw this video and went YAAAAAAAS
I've been able to tell for a while that there was something going on 😅 You seem like a good match, wishing you both the best!
Congratulations!!
To be fair you guys have had a great chemistry even early on and that seemed very natural. To have such a solid friendship naturally develop is arguably the best way for a relationship to come together.
Actually dating Connor?! Well I didn't think you were but.. YOU SHOULD BE!  But that shower reason is a pretty reasonable reason I suppose!
Great for you both.  Does it mean you ahve to clean up your Ramen shop and make it more healthy? 😉
Banff is beautiful. I got to ride one of those tracked vehicles out on a glacier, which was pretty cool.
Good on you, mate.   However, I like Sharla, so it hurts me to see Chris had to show not her video, but Trash Taste’s obnoxious reaction to it.  I can’t stand Connor, and Chris is so much better that I can never understand why he even hangs out with that guy.  I honestly don’t get why The Anime Man hangs out with him either. And I felt this way before I knew Connor didn’t even SHOWER!  I mean, I started using unscented deodorant because I’m about to visit Japan.  In a society where they don’t even like the smell of perfume, what kind of insensitive jerk goes around stinking?  And how could anyone think he had a shot with Sharla?  Ugh.
No way! I'm from Victoria! I'd love to meet you if you visit!
I was listening to the 10 Year live stream, but you unlisted it. :(
"Of course I get access to maple syrup! And I will happily drizzle it on my scone while I complain about the rain."  I mean, if you're gonna get into one national stereotype, why not go all in, Chris?
Came for news about Canada, stayed for the impression of Pete, lol
Because Canadians are the best.
Aw happy for you two!
New hub channel "Abroad in Sharla" to be announced.
No one talking about his amazing Premier American Pete impression?
Don't cut out meat, that's not a great plan for most people. Just cut out fried anything.
Chris, I hope you realise that you've ruined the dreams of many adoring female fans...when you announced your original bromance with Joey!
Congrats
I always thought you both were a cute couple, until I learn it just happened now lol
I def agree on the whole date someone who's your friend thing. Me and my fiance were best friends for 6 years before we started dating and we've now been together for 10 years. :)
NO! I wouldn't date him. He doesn't SHOWER AHAHAHA 👍 like
Congratulations Chris, wish you both the best, your privacy should be always respected.
While watching this video, I spilled hot sauce into the open cut on my hand… congrats to you both.
Common Chris W
Love is stronger than allergies
The most affable couple in all of Japan
Makes sense now… she never stopped laughing around you.  It’s a weird cat out of the bag… it’s like “oh, it’s actually quite a good cat”… a none allergy causing cat.  It makes so much sense it’s something you keep thinking you should be second guessing it lol.  I think it’s just that no one would have even thought about it.  Your characters do compliment each other very well.  This is lovely to hear…  I just realised the weird part is you hardly ever talk about dating Chris… apart from one or two that were really just funny stories.  Hip hip hurray!
Whooooaaaah, you guys are dating?? Congrats! I wish all the happy days for you together
We're over here in Canada lighting off fireworks for this occasion :)
Hehehe, I knew they were eventually gonna end up together.
It makes sense to have time to figure out your own relationship before having others commenting on it. Poor Connor being rejected.
Solid Pete the American impression
What am I gonna do with my Chris x conner fan fic?
Sorry, didn't hear a word that you were saying, are those Pewdipie's glasses? Did he give you the glasses that he bought from Wish sometime ago?
Knew it was love at first sight with the "Bread Girl" video way back when...
Good call Chris. I also dated a good friend of mine, after like 7 years of knowing her. I kind of had a crush on her every now and then, and eventually we started dating and got married. So yeah, dating friends is awesome.
I unfortunately missed the stream, so I really appreciate the fact that there are tidbits of it being posted like this. Keep up the good work!
Pshaw, sure you are dating a Canadian 🤨🙄 betcha she loves you too... To bad we can never meet her.**  **It's a common joke that people who don't have girlfriends claim they are going steady with a girl from canada... And thus being so far away, it's impossible to call them on their lies.
Love conquers the cat allergy
Congrats,
This one is still hiding in the closet I see.
Congrats! Abroad 🤝 Sharla -> In Japan
3:20 developed a stronger tolerance of kitty. i wonder how that's come about...................don't be pinning maro or tuna in any of your hedonistic activities
Congrats. I called it years ago and was always wondering what took it so long. All the best to both of you.
poor conner, his boosm friends moving ahead in life while he's stuck single
Sharla is a weird way to pronounce Connor
Woah.. I'm from Van island too!
you two definitely looked like a couple as far as chemistry goes so I'm not surprised
Canada is a bit of a dictatorship rn
Oh, he's getting all red in the face, cute.
Congratulations to both of you and yes, it’s true: Always better when you date or get into a relationship with your friend. My late fiancée and I were friends for years but didn’t even realize we had true feelings for each other but it seemed everyone else around us did. I wish you two, the very best and blessings. 🥰
✏️Start a relationship with a good friend for the chemistry....stay for the maple syrup privileges.✅️
Since Ryoutaro was not included in the possible Best Man i guess there's a possibility that he could become Sharla's Bridesmaid.
Literally every channel makes videos about dating and breaking up lmao
I love how when Chris says he isn't dating Connor, he doesnt lead with "Oh I'm not attracted to men", he just basically calls him stinky and implies regardless whether he's into men or not, he wouldn't date him. I just find that hilarious
Expected something like this so congrats Chris, hope the relationship goes well!
Can defo see you are working hard on being healthier, you look like you have lost some weight on your face, jawline looks like it could cut someone XD
👏👏👏👏
Does sharla Maybe have this norwegian cats? 🐤 Heared they are great for people with allergy :3
Congrats to you both mate. Also, going to go out on a limb and guess that Connor's not exactly struggling for dates.
Damn I always tho you were in for Connor.
That's awesome! I think you two are great together!
Congratulations! I love her content! She's so gorgeous! I wish you both nothing but happiness and success! 😁❤️
I love you both! You guys are  some of my favorite YouTubers. Wish you both the best in your relationship!
So that wasn't a joke? you two are actually dating
I wish you both all the luck!
About time!
So happy for you two! 💘💘
I just want to let you know that Vancouver is extremely boring, in case you plan to do a video here. We have bears though. Bears and really bad drug problem and expensive housing. But bears!!
Kinda wondered after she got back from Korea and she started doing things together in overlapping videos with Chris. Even though that doesn't mean dating, it does often reflect a type of friendship I've seen people slowly grow from into solid romantic relationships (the doing things together, not the videos).
I fully agree on the be friends first thing. So much better and you get to know them more than just going on dates with someone right away.
Chee anime them make like you torcher them not to say nothing and kinda knew but I'm like kool just don't know why it's big deal just hope you guys have more trips together.
I wouldn't be surprised if they end up married
I wouldn'f be surprised if they end up married
Maybe true love cures allergies 😁
True love conquers all allergies, as they say, lolol
i've never seen chris blush so much,felt like high school all again
Congrats on that Chris. Happy to learn about that. Good luck to you both.
I’m happy for you and wish you the best of 🍀 luck. I remember seeing you and sharla in videos and liked the chemistry. You can be allergic to a specific cat and not all cats
Well finally, it's what we all knew all along - a very nice couple ;) Congrats you will make lovely maple covered pancakes together
❤️❤️❤️
By Eck that's smashing
Congrats! All the best to you
Probably because of your hairband they thought you an Connor were dating
"Winning!"  -Mr. Charlie Sheen, 2011
half of canada is british so makes sense
I never thought I'd be the person getting hyped over youtubers dating BUT HERE I AM
Glad that your cat allergy has gotten better since you are both dating, could we expect a part 2 to the cats in Japan documentary? Ft. Sharla? One can only hope.
The hardest thing to believe about this is that Sharla, someone known for her healthy living and delicious vegan food options is dating Chris "Famichicken" Broad.   Good luck to both of you in the future!
I thought It was obvious 😂😂
Easy answer to the video title is "Canadians are pretty good, innit?"
Yes Montrealer here representing!!!  Canada is pretty ok.
i seriously thought you were gay
Chris, cat allergy is something your body can get used to really easly and fast. Both my sister and my father are alergic and we have 4 cats for th longest time. Soon u stop getting th alergic reactions.
WTF SHARLA IS 4 YEARS OLDER. She looks younger.
The reason people thought you and Connor were dating is because none of them have any friends nor have they seen any real friends. Anyway, best of luck to you and Sharla! I really enjoy watching both of your channels!
I feel like if Connor was dating someone, he probably wouldn't tell for a long while as well
It's heart warming to see Chris talking about his romantic relationship and his advice to date a friend, someone you've known well got me thinking. I kind of realized that I like my own friend that I've known for well over 8 years now and I hesitate to even confess because the fear of rejection, it would make things awkward and I don't wanna lose the friendship that we have. I'm 22 and never dated before, I know I'm young but I really want a romantic relationship that lasts long and probably for life. I'm a believer that you should be with someone that you've known well for long, so when Chris said you should date your friend made me really want to do it. Sorry for the overshare I just want to vent a little bit, anyway I'm happy for both of you!
When the journey in Japan end now mr chris can make either Aboard in Spanyol or either... Aboard in Canada
just dont go vegetarian or vegan meat isnt actually unhealthy
I'm happy you and Sharla are dating, but, more important, thats a great Pete impersonation.
you need to go to anywhere in the yukon, its so beautiful there.
Yeah, a few more crossovers on average would be good and reasonable. Definitely don't merge the channels into one, because while there is a major overlap in the audience, it's for the best if most productions are separate for various reasons, such as being able to double-dip on viewership.
yes!!!!!!!!!
Happy for both of you and even though neither of you needed to say anything it's good you both waited until you were comfortable making it public.  Met Sharla when she did a fan meetup years ago in Osaka and she's great.
Well why do we need to know your knocking each other off lol  However at least a Canadian and Brit should have a less cultural issues as such and the challenge for the canadian will be putting up with the British guys Humour. I mean thats the biggest issue lol - And can you have @Sharmeleon show and present on your channel in your studio - that'd be good where she interviews you or you interview her. On Japan in General etc  But It'd be funny to see her take over your studio for a show lol
"I would never date Connor mainly because he doesn't shower, but secondarily I'm not attracted to men."
I have been married to my spouse for 5 years, dated for almost 14 years. We were friends for a year before we dated. Definitely the best advise. If you have been friends for a while. You know that person and you kinda already know what to except out of that relationship as you take the next step
Due to Chris' sarcastic nature, even when he said "yeah Sharla and me are dating" I'm still wondering if he's being sarcastic
Good luck in life, all the best from alien in Uk ;-)
You lucky bastard!
grants reaction was too sus,kinda like that one guys who cheers for the opposite team in the stadium and realizes he's the only fan for the team there and then suddenly starts to booo
I KNEW IT!!! A very small part of me thought it was gonna end up being Chiaki, though they barely see each other, so... I'm so happy for you guys!!! 🥂Congrats!!
I love seeing you two in videos together. You both always look so happy and in love that your joy is contagious.  Also, this is by far the most I have seen you smile before!
Very happy for you guys. Most of your interactions from past videos, definitely felt like there was some chemistry there 😊 👍🏾
That Pete impression was on point lmao
I honestly thought you too had something going on since you did the bike challenge
I thought I unsubscribed to this channel already, why is YouTube still recommending it?
Chris talking about Mario 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣
I still think Sharla and Chris are trolling us and laughing behind the scenes lol
I'd pay to see Natsuki's best man speech.
I'm dying of laughter I didn't know you and Connor were a ship. I guess I don't keep up with the comments but omg LOL YOU AND CONNOR. Congrats on going public with Sharla though!
YEEEEES!! I FUCKING KNEW IT!!!
Congrats but I hate to break it to you, you two were pretty obvious and I already had my suspicions   https://youtu.be/jVcf5iOszjc At 7:45, that "absolutely beautiful" was with your head turned and looking straight at her. We knew, Chris. We knew ;)
I want more ryotoro (I have no idea how to spell his name I’m sorry)
Nah you are dating sharla for the unlimited poutine lol congratulations guys, I'm so happy for you! Xoxo fellow Canadian who lives an hour from banff
Happy for u Chris!
You didn't actually give off gay vibes, some people are just very bad at understanding different types of relationships.
That's really nice 👍👍
I knew it! Congrats
c0nnor is so heart broken
01:14 is what you want to hear
So happy for you guys ^^ wish you all the best for ya
wait im confused, did you say sharla is dating DAVE IN JAPAN!?!?
👍
punching above mate lol have to say you both have a good energy together
Happy to hear the news! Been a while since I checked your videos but I must say the constant camera switching is is really distracting and kind of annoying. Feels very unfocused. Still, keep up the good work and can't wait for another "Journey across Japan"
I knew it when I saw you guys  on the mountain trip
I am happy for chris.
Congratulations!! Thanks for sharing the T with us.
I can't wait for their joint channel. Babies in Japan
Glad everything’s going well for you!
the real question that should be asked is why is a canadian dating a british person
I thought it was a joke. Cos everyones dating Chris.....
you guys are so cute together!
I feel like I'm watching Sherlock all over again - Connor is Sherlock, Chris is John "I'm not gay" Watson, and Sharla is Mary. But that has terrifying consequences, so I'm going to talk myself out of this analogy as soon as I can.
I had such a dumb smile on my face for the entire video.
A Brit dating a Canadian. So... opposites do attract. haha Good for you two.
🥰 sweet
I'm happy you two are happy together. Everybody deserves that kind of joy and positivity in their lives.
I’ve been wanting this for so long 🥹
My mom had a cat allergy problem when I was a kid, but she got over it after I talked her into getting an “outside only” cat. She turned into a bit of a cat lady over the decades after that, lol.
i thought she was with mark! nooOOo, unsub!!! LMAO XD, just kidding. my god they look so cute together! so happy for them!
I’m so happy about this Omg. :) Chris, I was allergic to my husband’s cat too so I got allergy shots, then sublingual allergy drops and it’s really helped. Glad you’re doing better on your own with the allergies though, but you might need a boost.
Yeah, ok. I want an entire episode where Chris talks in an American Accent. Please!
wait is chris not gay for real or is it a bit?  jk congrats my dudes
Banff is awesome, just got back.  10/10 highly recommend, and Victoria is worth the visit as well.  Loved it.  Just wondering if dating Sharla means you'll be more vegetarian than in times past... ;)  I'd miss the wagyu reviews.
That's awesome! Congratulations and much happiness to both of you. 💙
I'm a huge fan of the both of you.  Watch all your video's.  Congrat's man.  I am very happy for you both.  I'm getting married myself and only took me till my 40's to meet the one.  Keep up the great work.
Literally made my day.
That Pete impression was great.
Congratulations I wish you both years of happiness
well done Chris she's a lovely girl it should I've fancied a few girls in my life and then someone else gets them and I say (IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME)
I would wager a bet that you know exactly when your relationship became romantic, but I totally respect your desire to keep that private. Congrats, you guys seem great together!
I feel so happy for you and Sharla. We always watch your Videos and was wishing that the Video Dates would become More 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
I'm calling it now, sharla only wants Chris for his alter ego... Ironmouse
Connor is a JoJo fan and let’s just say the comments felt the JoJo energy the most when Connor appears in Chris’s videos
Wait. This is news? I thought y’all beeeeeeeen dating.
Why did they edit Connor celebrating when he found out? Surely he'd be mortified, he's lost his boyfriend.
Totally Congratz mate ! Since i saw you 2 biking on that tour; I was hoping you'd hook up with her :D.
Yay! Congratulations Chris, Wish you well!
I'm glad you're with Sharla.
As I’ve commented before, this has to be the worst kept secret in Japan. I’m thrilled that you two are together and wish you all the best. Your face is looking thinner, not so puffy, so your fitness regimen must be working. Good for you.
Congratulations Chris :)
About time you fessed up. Congratulations you two. 🎉🎊🎈
Hmmmmm.... you guys gay off those vibes... I don't know. We were just asking ourselfes: This fat english man with the goal to get healthy again, just looks like he needs something more in his life. Not a lot of waifus in his videos, but A LOT of guys. Hmmm maybe he's gay? Conclusion: You should grow waifus on trees for more likes, subs and comments!
She only loves you for your ramen shop, Chris.
So happy for you two! You and Sharla seem like wonderful people that work very well together! Love both of your channels and wishing you guys the best! <3<3<3
I've been waiting for this day for YEARS. 😍 I'm so happy for you both!
My sister has bad cat and dog allergy but she's always had cats and dogs because apparently she's never allergic to her own animals. It's weird but understandable at the same time. She's straight on the medicines when she pets my dogs though.
From biggest rival to lover. What a twist!
I thoguht Chris was dating CdwagVA!
Called it
"I'm not gay" proceeds to go to a love hotel with Connor lol Congrats on the anouncement.
Ohh that's why you gained weight then. Couples tend to gain a couple kilos :)
I commented chris & Sharla should date a year ago on a tkyosam video.   You can honeymoon in Niagara Falls lmao.  Just please don’t wind up like  those freaks simon and martina 🙏
looking much healthier, gf or a new diet?
Good Luck to you. Looking forward to Escape to Paradise!
#TheLandBeforeTime.
7:02 legit chad backstreet boy
Well done, Chris!
Ha new it !
The details are none of our business, all ill say is that i'm glad you found happiness, and it's crazy if you didn't go to japan not only would you not have a media empire now you wouldn't have found someone you really really care about.. i know it has to be for real if you if you were friends for years first.. all i can say is bonne chance brother.. and you guys keep on keeping on.. and keep making that quality content both of you.. and ill drink a shot to "taking chances". sometimes they really pay off.
Don’t know how we missed this. Sharla’s choice of words is sometimes oddly British 🤣
😁😁😁 congratulations
2:19 Nah, it's just the sarcasm that doesn't stop cuz we like the joke
Congrats to you both and best wishes.  I'm just a rando out here, but my advice: even though you're both well renowned YTers, you have every right to make this as a private a relationship as you want. Remember that you don't owe anyone out here anything about your dating life. Share as much or as little as you feel like. Period.  And while you'll inevitably have to balance work and romance, I think the same applies whether you work in an office or in front of a YT camera: Unless it's absolutely mission critical, always choose time together (doing whatever it is you want) over work. As much as possible. Life's too short as it is.  Be well, and much joy to you both!
What will Connor do!
You don't need to cut down on meat. It's the fat and carbs you need to avoid more. Carbs give fast energy, fats give more energy and longer, but fills less, protein keeps you satiated longer. Fat has 9kcal/g, protein 4kcal/g and carbs 4kcal/g.
You're dating a Canadian?! Oh, no! I'm so sorry for your lost :(
Yessss thanks gods🥰
It's always great to see the "friendzoning" not going through :) It's great to date a former long time friend, well done both of you! Wish you both the best!
there is someone actually believe that connor and chris are dating wtf. lmao
As a Canadian, if you vist avoid Vancouver........and Victoria for that mater atm.
Felt like I was going to pass out today  So the boys wholesome reaction was very much Needed ..... I feel ever so slightly less bad now
poor connor
Awww so pleased, not surprised though. Wishing you both all the best.
Adorable!
Congratulations to both of you
the gay part i think chris is because you never talked about dating in japan or outside... thats why people guessing.
I also dated my friend who I knew since I was working and we started dating and its was great , now we are married and have a great daughter and made an amazing family together.  Best decision ever!!!
Been watching since 2018, found you when i started my career. Entertaining as all hell. Drone shots and tori gates. Too much volcano. Looking forward to where you go from here!
Seems they were shipping them hard
Love conquered cat allergies! 🤣🤣🤣
Good on ya.
congrats on you and hope your relationship continues to go well. Sadly I just got out of a relationship with a good friend of mine at first. But we're still friends since it wasnt toxic. But your advice with dating a friend is honestly good advice personally :)
Glad for both of you.
Natsuki best man indeed
Damn, I can't belive poor Emma had one of her potential Tokyo Creative harem members stolen from her 🤣.  Congratulations to the both of you, Really glad to hear this has been going well for some time now and hopefully the Trial by jealousy judgemental online neckbeards does not waste too much of your time jealous that Sharla has stolen IronMouse from them.
Allergies get desensitized due to constant exposure to allergen
Easily the  best part of this video is Chris speaking in Pete’s American accent
Your fucking American accent at 3:57 was gold.
You did good bud. It's good you are happy to. Congratulations. You got a good woman on your hands. You 2 make a beautiful couple.
o i secretly though he was gay with his best japanese friend. but this also not shocking me the vibe those 2 gave over the years. he checked her booty
Does that mean you'll stop going to love hotels with Connor?
Eeeeeee I'm so happy, I love Chris and Sharla together 💜
Just like a streamer, he's wearing a headpiece with neon lights, lol!
Somehow I always knew they'd be dating eventually. They've got great chemistry and makes a cute couple.
I am just waiting for the video of you with her cats now 😆 But really happy that you’re so happy.
Worst American accent, ever. Thanks for the content, Chris!
😂you sounded just like Pete
D'awwwww so adorbs. I bet you two stupid faces would make a cute baby! Don't get all fussy I say that to everyone...
Finally. ☺
I am happy for you, but even more so I am sad for Connor, I do hope you at least apologized to him
I live not far from Victoria, if you’re around I’ll buy the both of you a drink. Congrats and good luck to both of you.
OMG!!! Your Pete impression was Spot on!!!!!!  LOL for real! had to rewind and laugh over 4 times!!!!
Oh my
This explains how Sharla got Chris to travel and look for Pokemon's manholes 🤷
Felicitations. Happy for you. Love rules:-)
I recently married my love after being friends with her for over three years before we started a relationship, those years very much helped as we knew each other a fair bit by the time we got together.  Five years later, I married her and couldn't be happier.  Best of luck to the both of you and don't ever feel the pressure or need to give constant updates about your private life.
I'm happy for Chris, but I'm sad that we'll lose his characteristic British grumpiness  now that he'll actually be happy for once. J/k Chris. All the best
Congratulations man hope you two are gonna live a happy life
I knew they were dating for a while cause it was the only time Chris would genuinely smile lmao
As a resident of Vancouver Island I can safely say your newfound privileges are as follows: Go away.
Happy for you both :) Just imagine a Natsuki best man speech though XD
Connor, when is your turn 👀
Oh my god! Congrats!!
That is the BEST Pete impression!!!! Also congrats you two, my wife said you should be dating after watching the first Journey series :D
Cutest couple EVER!!!!   So affable!!! 💕💞💘😂
CDawgVA would have been too young for Chris
Canadians are fuckin awesome
I mean technically they are still part of the British empire so under the thumb of a angry British guy probably just feels like home
Date a friend, best advice ever! It's been a couple month since I started dating my best friend, we've known each other for more than 10 years, been friend since maybe 7 years and best friend since 5 years, and now he's the most amazing boyfriend I've had in my life <3 anyway I'm so happy for both of you!
ahh i love this my two fav japan vlog channels, congrats guys 😄❤
It's ok Chris I'm allergic to some cat fur more than others too. There's some cats that I'll sneeze instantly when I get near, and others I can cuddle and not even sniffle. I think they have different types of fur and we're only allergic to specific types.
So happy for you guys! Best wishes to you both.
Dude these are great news. 👍
About damn time bro!
congratulations to the both of you! love the tight knit Japan youtuber community
i knew it from so long time ago hahaha
Defo want to see a few videos of you guys reviewing typical “romance” stuff in Japan from your perspectives. Would be interesting no?
Congrats! When my Mum found out she just went, "yeah, duh, obviously." Lol
I can't believe you're not dating Connor. Eughh, unsubscribed
Obv. Good news. You tube wedding?? Oh yes!!
Love to see it. Happy for you man!
We kind of guessed! But so happy for you two! x FYI-you can get over cat allergies in about 2 weeks once you're in regular contact with them. I've had 2 allergic exes, they just got over it!
She's a keeper Chris
Congrats Chris and Sharla. I love your videos and you both make a great team. 👍
Shar looks cool and like she is pretty fun. Hope you have a great relationship!  Edit: wait, this is youtube comment section. Enjoy you chonker!!
congrats mate!
After the last videos with Connor...yeah, I also thought you guys were a gay couple...lol
I’m not one to ship really people but I’ve always thought you’d make a good match. You two have sweet chemistry!
I want that light up headband so bad
Long may it continue mate! Great to see you guys together, there's always been something there!
So happy for you both love you both separately and even more together how you bounce off each other’s energy. Best wishes to you both! Super happy as well so see you both so happy as you really deserve it. ❤️~ p.s seeing both of your videos makes my day so please keep up your amazing videos !
Keeping a clean house makes all the difference to a guest with cat allergies.
"Date a friend" Perfect advise, now I just need friends
Normies should just go and explode. Aren't you worried that your miserable, cynic, and grumpy Brit persona will suffer from happiness now?
I saw a video again of you two at a shrine a year ago and it felt like literally you two on a date. Should have known
I always thought you two would make a great couple ❤️
I got a cat allergy when I was younger from not being around cats (didn't originally have one), and then after taking in kittens my allergy has gone away. Now have 3 cats of my own
A big (belated) congratulations to you two! I had a feeling that there was something going on between the two of you when I saw her videos where you drove her around the Tohoku region so she could search for the Pokémon manhole covers. Only a boyfriend would do something like that 😉  One of my first (joking) thoughts was that Connor must be disappointed that you’re “off the market.” But the fact that you’ve talked about your past struggles dating Japanese *women* clued me in that you’re not gay.   I second your advice about dating someone you’re friends with first. My now-husband and I were friends for well over a year before we started dating, so you’re in good company.
But Chris I don't have a friend.. So there goes my chance of dating one.
very excited for you guys
Love how he has to explain why he's chosen a Canadian
Awwwww blushing Chris 🤭
Maro and Tuna approves of the relationship  that's why
More American accent lines!  ... oh and happy to see you and Sharla dating, quite the affable arrangement! Good luck!  and, Banff is nice, so is Jasper. try out Victoria too.
Lovey lovely lovely best of luck to both of you. Treat her right
very cute!! congrats! ^O^ ❤❤❤
Man I've been apart of the Abroad in Japan audience since maybe 2015 or 2016 and I am so unbelievably happy to hear this news. Chris is someone I look up to quite a lot due to my ambitions of wanting to teach in the JET program. Congratulations to you and Sharla!
I think 99.99% of the community knows you and Conner aren't gay or dating but it's more a meme. Only a small fraction would think you guys were actually dating.
I thought Chris was the gay
Oh shit congrats. that's really awesome. Totally missed that news. :D
Congrats, glad you're enjoying yourself. I do sometime wonder quietly why even such a video about your personal life is needed in this day and age, but thanks for sharing, thanks for being open and hope you have fun. Oh and you definitely get accustomed to allergies to animals.
I'm more surprised you are dating a vegan. Especially with your love for chicken.
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  I'm so fcuking happy for you two. Been watching your channel since it's inception.  Love from India.
I'm so happy for you guys! You and Sharla are two of my favorite YouTubers so it's just awesome to know you guys are happy! 😊
you are not allergic to cats fur its just the saliva
So happy for you both. I actually thought you were both together from the last video you were in.   She’s a very beautiful lady and after the health scare happiness is well deserved xxx
And the other reason, im not gay!
Oh don't lie, you're dating her for the legal weed
I think this is to cover up conner pretty hard denial not being gay lmfao congrats truely think alot us thought you two made a cute couple.
This is a real life example of OTP.
Congrats for talking to a girl
WoW Congrats! considering the age difference, she looks amazingly good
Ah, yes! AbroadInCanada 👏
I saw that edit of Sharla with the boys yelling and 100% thought it was a joke lmao
BUSTY BLONDE, good choice. but yes, you did engage with that bread girl
Yay grats guys , I always thought you had great chemistry.
Congrats! I thought y’all were dating years ago.. hope she turns you into a vegetarian!
Chris isn't gay preposterous! Jk happy for you!
Aww. Boys and Girls hearts broken across the world knowing Chris is off the market.  I hope you guys stay happy :)
Victoria BC is very beautiful!  Usually take the Victoria Clipper from Seattle to the island.
You both got a bit chunkier, so I guess it fits
It makes me so happy that you guys are together. You guys make the sweetest couple ever.  I remember there was this really cute video you guys did together were you took her to see  the mountain temple in A Day at Yamadera Mountain Temple and you carried her purse/backpack purse while you were climbing the stairs and I just found it so sweet. Most guys (even if they liked the girl) would never carry a woman bag for fear of not looking macho. But you looked like a gentle man.
Happy for you two!!
Well done to you both and yeah it is better to date a friend than a stranger..
Their chemistry together is so good, I’ve always thought they’d be good together. All the best to both of them!
Protect your privacy. Best wishes.
i kinda had my suspicions lol,but never gave them too much thought since it was a personal thing to yall,still rlly happy to know about it,and the fact that its going well!yall look extremely cute together,best wishes <8                but cmon we all know Connor is still Chris's one and only boyfriend
Now now lads, Connor has Ironmouse so he will be just fine! ;D
should have just been a 5 second video of chris going "better than an american, innit?"
Why does the title make it seem like being Canadian is something bad lmao
I love Natsuki because he reminds me of one of my best friends, Koji. They're both so ridiculous and silly and full of love!
Banff is really good Chris you really should go and if you do make sure to see lake Louise and ride the gondola
Bachelor party across Japan?!!
Thank you Chris for confirming the rumours… that Sharla does indeed shower (by way of also confirming that Connor does not) 😂 very happy for you.
Cats that have longer fur that's more hair-like are typically better for allergies as well. There's a myth that their hypoallergenic which has been proven to not be quiiite true, but allergy reactions are typically less severe.
Sometimes it seems Youtuber only date Youtubers
No joke, i swear to god I thought Chris was dating Cdawg. Am I the only one?
You lucky dog
😂😂😂
CONFIRMED: CHRIS BROAD, YOU TUUUBAAH FROM THE POPULAR YOUTOUBE CHANNEL "ABROAD IN JAPAN" IS A HOMOPHOBE. DESTROYS HOPES OF YOUNG WELSCH LAD WHO IS RUMORED TO HARBOR FEELINGS.
In all seriousness, My fiancee and I met at a Halloween party. Highly recommend. Possibly the best way to meet people.
Not sure if dating a friend is a good idea. In my experience it leads to 3 awesome years, 2 middling years and 2 shit years, and ends with a nasty break up. Hope your relationship goes better! Beware the 7 year itch!
i thought he would have got on with emma tbh
I have never clicked on a video so fast!
I couldn't be happier for you two. I wish you happiness together !
Still seeing alot of Conner in this video about your girlfriend.   Im glad to see you are still repping for your boyfriend on the DL.
Natsuki as best man... I doubt you'd remember the bachelor party.
Canada has communism. I wouldn't worry about it.
Since the bread video it was Chris’s plan all along!!
Oh fuck me, don't go vegan. Meat is healthy.
Of course Mr. Affable would date a Canadian.
Congrats Chris and Sharla..you look so lovely together,i was wondering when you both come out and tell the wievers about your relationship with her 🙂
Was on this speculation train for a while, but happy for you both!!!🧡🧡🧡
Chris, I'm happy for you because as with the other viewers, I saw it developing years ago and you two are a good match.   Yet I feel sad, because now one more has left us in this never-ending cycle of despair.    But savour it and enjoy this happiness, you deserve it.  :)
Good for the two of you,all the best 🙋🏻‍♀️❤️
I love your videos and i've been following for a couple years now, but I must have missed some things because uh. I don't know who Sharla is, the first time I heard of them was during your livestream when you got back to Japan a couple weeks ago. I'm super happy for you but uh. Could someone give me like a basic rundown of how/when Sharla and Chris like. Did youtube stuff together and how? I really don't think I've seen anything with her.
Fake, Canada isn't real
Honestly Chris has some amazing, true friends here. What a bunch of bros 🥺
I haven't watched Sharla's stuff in awhile, not because I dislike it or anything, I just don't really watch her stuff. What I do remember was she was I think on the verge of getting married to a guy, but he broke it off and broke her heart? I'm glad she's doing better now and she's with you, I feel like you're a good guy, if not a tad snarky haha. I bet that snarkyness is just your internet persona tho, I bet you're a pretty chill dude off camera.   Cheers to you both!
I saw you guys on that bike trip you made. I already thought it was a shame you werent a couple because it seemed you already had a 'click'. cheers mate
I wish you both the best
It's so f@#ing clear from day 1 chris...
Thank you. I think you two are great together. Hearing this made me very happy
Congratulations - you are both at least as per your tube and almost certainly almost in real life great people who hopefully end up happy. Genuinely wishing both of you lots of happiness and enjoyment together.Wishing you both all the best!!!👍👍👍
So happy Sharler decided to be the Beard to Chris to cover up his closeted relationship with Connor.
Shame on you😔
Finally!
Lol I love how you never addressed people thinking youre gay before it's actually become relevant. That's what a real ally looks like; not scared of people thinking that.  Congrats on your relationship! Don't leave Connor out too much now ;) /j
Some cat breeds are fine for allergy's.  Maybe Sharla's cats are one of those?
Damn mans left Connor and Fried Chicken Damn
Poor Connor. Not only he cant date you anymore, he also wont get to be your bestman? Wtf Chris
Mrs. In Japan!
Finally
Chris isn't gay, he's European
Cdawg must be heartbroken :(
Im glad your happy
Really chuffed for you and Sharla! Best of luck to you two!
4:00 Absolutely brilliant accent I’m dying
Of course they were dating. Obviously!
I echo the whole "date a friend". It's what worthwile bonds are made of.
Ahhh yes, a Commonwealth Union™
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You two make a fabulous couple . I’m so happy for you both 😁 And it’s true , it’s much easier if you’ve been friends for a couple of years , and then start dating . Love all your episodes. Take care Chris !!!
Surely "Would date again" is, like,  the minimum requirement for a relationship
Sounds like Sharla is his beard
Yayyyyyyyy Les gooooo fuck yeahhhh
I said that from the first time i saw u together years ago! I love this , u guys are a good match. So much in common and ur calm and funny and exactly what sharla needs! And she is kind cute chill and adventurous also a perfect fit for Chris!
Is it Sharla? Haven’t watched the video yet btw Edit: I knew it! It only took you guys like 5 years!
Nothing gay about a bromance 🤷‍♂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
Sharla: Hey Chris want to see my cat? Chris: Yeah Sharla: Come over Chris: So where's the cat? Sharla: Meow
Candia
My god :D I need  Linus x Chris collab video :d
Congratulations Chris and Sharla!
Congrats both! Japan vlog power couple 😅 wishing a bright future to you both 😘
I think everyone on the channel is very chuffed at the news.  I'm still amazed at how generous both Chris and Sharla have been with the details of their lives. We're certainly not entitled to be this nosy about their private lives but they are handling the scrutiny with a lot of class.
I ryotoro still alive or has he finally become a bond villain?
bro, you could of did that 4 years ago. She wanted you bro lol
Gotta confirm what Chris advised on dating friends. I’ve been friends with my husband since college, where we got to know each other for real without much pretense. Then one day we happened to be single at the same point in our lives. Confessions were made, and it’s been a done deal ever since. ☺️
I wish you wholehearted all the best 🥺
yay 🥹🥹🥹
I like that both you and Sharla are indepedent and create indepedent content as well and not like those cringey youtube couples making cringey "content".
The bois celebrating like crazy haha
I married my best friend :) best advice ever date a friend ❤️
I am so happy you guys are together, I always loved when you guys were in each others videos. I am looking forward to date videos! Best date spots in Japan!
Cheers from Canada
So it was true, you are dating Sharla. I thought it was just a huge joke, when sharla said it seemed more like she was just having a lark.  Since everyone has been nagging about for god knows how long, well then.. The best to the both of you, i did not see this coming at all 😄
We all knew, good on ya.
"10/10 would date again" 🤣🤣🤣 bro wat
Omg. That one Journey Across Japan video where she fed you natto I thought she might kissed you to cheer you up.  Lol.
Sharla proving Chris is indeed affable
Banff is absolutely idyllic. Beautiful place.
Congratulations both of you
A woman who forgives you for the rollercoaster nightmare is worth keeping mate! Congrats to both of you !
Connor is now officaly the only member of Trash Taste without a significant other
abroad in sharla
Congrats guys, just keep it out the media that's the fastest way to kill the romance haha
FYI - You have zero gay vibes Chris lol. Just good friends with other guys which is awesome.  Happy for you and Sharla! Long distance relationship right? My husband and I did that for 2.5 years before getting married. He is from Finland and Im from USA. It’s hard but can be really great too.
"10 outta 10 would date again" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Cute 🥰 love it. All the best 😍
now I know it's not a hoax not one of Chris Broad's crappy jokes I can be an honest man saying good luck to the top couple in Japan
wait what? It was real? I thought it was a meme. Bruh I'm soo happy for you guys  PS - Chris that was an amazing american accent.
So all that with cdawgva meant nothing!?
"Apples innit?" ~Chris 2k22
Couldnt tell if Sharlas video was a joke. Still confused now.
what not a shock.when she was in London at the same time.. why is there shock
Regarding the cat allergy. I am allergic and I own a cat. Depending on your degree of allergy, I think your body adapts to that specific cat. The first few months with my current cat were hard, I was not ok lol but it got better and after 4 or 5 months, all symptoms got away, but when I met a friend's cat it all starts again.
You should create a relationship channel called “Chris IN Sharla” 😂😏
one night in canada please? :) every millennial know paris already.
My wife has a cat allergy also, pretty bad too. But when we moved in together her cat allergy disappeared pretty quickly. We thought it was because my cat was an American Shorthair. If you have issues, my best advice is to invest in (really good) air purifilers those help a LOT with dust/pet dander allergies if they pick up for you later that is. All the best!
Saw Sharla’s video first but nice to see you sharing this here, Chris. So happy for you both. You make a lovely couple😊
Why so racial? Lol
Please hold her hand or link arms or some thing while y’all are together on your next video please show a little PDA. There’s so many people in the world that will be living vicariously through you. No pressure of course
WOOO!!
It took many many years but y’all always had an a very obvious chemistry and I’m so happy for y’all I seriously think y’all gonna get married 😂🤗
the outro is dope 🔥
Love how his friends freaking out ❤ Best wishes for you two. Don't fuck this up, Chris.
Was wondering when this would happen lol
I know it! Whitout seen the other video!! Great for both ❤️❤️❤️
So happy for you, Chris!!! You're such a great person and deserve a great person by your side!
Chris isn’t gay! He’s bi.
Yasssss so cute!!! Congrats on the Canadian Cutie!!!
What? I saw the video earlier but I thought she was joking.
Ryotoro outside the wedding: Am I a joke to you?  Seriously though, congrats and good luck with it all, I have seen a few of Sharla's Videos and she does come across as a lovely lady and hopefully she can teach you a thing or two about Arcade games so you can finally get that Monkey.
11 minutes of Chris trying his absolute hardest to convince us he isn't gay.
I’m so excited!!  You two are my most favorite YouTubers. You two are so cute together, and I’m so happy for you both! 😊
Definitely happy for the two of you just beware of cat shedding season lol   I'm deathly allergic to cats myself but have three and my allergies only happen when they shed their winter coat X3
Very good Pete impression.
YouTube official
Hehehe
You will make great parents!
Because  she's hot!  num nutz now quit your bragging  and start creating content together!
Hehehe
Chris with a broad
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one nonetheless. Congrats and all the best with the relationship Chris 👍
"Me and Roger are David"  Me and David are Rogering ;)
Damn your Pete impression is pretty spot on!
Cheers!
I started dating my childhood friend in 2019. We kept it from our families for a while because we didn’t want it to be awkward if we decided early on that it wouldn’t work. It’s definitely a different experience because for me I had to make sure that what I felt for him wasn’t just platonic love and the relationship can progress at a different pace than other relationships that don’t have that foundation. Congrats you two!
You can develop a tolerance for specific cats.
My husband and I were friends for 2 years before we started dating.....we've been together 22 years, but married 5 of those ❤
Chris' impression of Pete is absolutely spot on 😂
I knew it for years now
MY SHIP FINALLY SAILED!!!!!!!!!
So happy for yall, hope the audience remains respectful of yalls relationship
It is not fair, I worried about you for years! Granny Sima
Here I was thinking Chris was playing coy with Garnt
Wishing you both much love and happiness. 💕 Can't wait to see the TC vid on Neko Neko Inn! 😸
What's the name of the song in the outro?
I think everyone new it. 😁
My brother is allergic to cats, we've always had cats, he gets used to them and didn't react so bad to his own
I so want this to work! I feel like a proud parent.
Chris,my best to you and Ms.Sharla.It always makes me smile to see two wonderful human beings find each other.
I figured at least a year or so ago
Whenever Sharla returns to Victoria definitely come if you can. Victoria is small but Gorgeous.
Wait wtf!!
I’m truly happy for you two, it makes me happy to see you both happy 🎉🙌🏻 thanks for sharing it :)
Aww! Congrats to you both. I love both your videos and the collabs too. Looking forward to more videos of you two together. All the best! ❤️
Man congratulations, u and sharla both deserv it! keep up the good work man
You guys were always together and I always thought you guys make a great couple ☺️
"me and roger are daving" - ironbroad, 2022
Very happy for you two! And I agree with your "be friends first" advice. My fiance and I were friends, then best friends first. And one day it just kind of happened and we started dating. There were no awkward moments because by the time we started dating we already knew everything about each other.
It's really weird that I knew this would happen about 5 years ago lol
I THOUGHT SO! Especially after she moved to your part of japan.
Monetising your relationship now Chris? He's finally run out of ideas.
Happy for the both of you! cheers
The only downside to this is that ConnorDawgVoiceActor can no longer say he's dating Chris as a cover unless Chris admits to being both bisexual and non-monogamous. but  I mean Chris is also Ironmouse so we could be fine I dunno. Congrats on not having a dysfunctional youtuber relationship that ended in a couple months.
✅Lives in Japan ✅Successful youtube career ✅Healthy relationship with youtuber girlfriend There's no stopping this man!
I am worried you will not be so adorable bitter in the videos. =)
Can Sharla confirm if Chris actually has the THRUSTMASTER (TM)
You'd have to be pretty stupid to be thinking Connor and Chris were dating. But I don't think anyone actually thinks that because they'd be pretty stupid
Finally a girlfriend that will appreciate his sticky note gifts
Have you ever listen to jorden peterson
Punching above your weight there, but good for you!
Chris's rant about not being gay must've CRUSHED CDawg, f in the chat 😢
Soo happy for you man!!!! Let's goooo 🐼🐼🐼🐼
Please keep on "dating" Connor though. It's funny
aww congrats you guys!! you make a great couple! your senses of humor definitely compliment each other!
Wowowow
Congrats Dude! 👍
Hope you enjoy montreal. Amazing city imo
Yeeeeeeeeeeee
🍻
To be far I thought you’re dating Connor
I used to wonder about this since the first video I saw you guys together on YouTube wish you guys the best ♥️
You missed the best joke for why you wont date Connor he's welsh XD come on as a Englishman i thought that would be the number 1 reason
some fluffy cats actually are hypoallergenic, they lack the dander that people with allergies are sensitive to
but but but conner
Abroad in Sharla
I always think you and Sharla look awesome together and i was right :) gratz
GOOD  NOW KISS
Dating since she still married?
Always thought you two looked sweet together, but didn't want to "Ship" you both but so Happy the oaf has found a nice grill!
Poor Chris, going to have to deal with some cats now.....
Congratulations
My man!! Hope you two have many awesome years, having fun in Japan!
Honestly who was surprised by this?
My partner and I have been together for 10 years, and we started out as friends. Relationships are absolutely stronger when the parties involved start as friends first. Good luck to the both of you, and I'm looking forward to more collaborative videos between you!
Very happy for you! It's very cute and heartwarming how happy you two seem to be in your videos ^^. TBH ever since you old video with her in Mt. Fuji I thought you would make a nice couple
Im so happy now :)  They always had the best chemistry in front of the camera.
I hope that YouTube doesn't get too intrusive with your relationship. Keep it to what you're comfortable with, happy for you two for being happy together
I remember watching a Chris-tmas special with Joey, Aki, Sharla, and Natsuki, and me telling my wife that you and Sharla would be a great couple. Well...
We already knew this fam
I like this format, do more videos like this 😀
How did anyone not realize the Connor x Chris ship was a joke? Chris is obviously very comfortable in who he is but they’ve never shown any kind of affection between the two of them. It’s ridiculous how far fangirls and fanboys will fetishize real people for their own needs. Congrats to Chris and Sharla! Y’all are lovely!
Very wholesome, very cute.
Damn I've been following your channel for years, and in your earlier videos you were always (very obviously jokingly) pinning her as the rival with the most subscribed japan vlogger channel or whatever LOL. 🤪🤪🤪 Who would have thought the relationship would happen years later lol, congrats you guys!
I always thought to myself why you and Sharla weren’t dating 😅 Wish you guys well
Congrats mate 👏 Sharla is amazing. Also, shame on you for toying with Connor ... smh 😂 (im surprised ppl actually thought u guys were a couple, some jokes just fly over some ppl heads)
The reaction of the boys in the beginning is so wholesome xD Happy for Chris and Shar!
Ok, only kinda on topic, but the "no showers" thing: You should not wash your hair everyday because it strips all the oils from your hair, making it more oily over time. It takes a bit of time at first since your body thinks it needs to produce more oil but after a little while your body will adjust and you will not need to wash your hair as much. Of course you should still shower/bathe everyday just don't wash your hair every time (wear a shower cap or something to keep it dry).
Not that there's anything wrong with that
Congrats! I think you two are really cute together and your personalities mesh really well. Hope everything goes well 🙏
Awwwwwwwwww how cute, I know you won't read this, but congratulations to you and Sharla! All the best.
It probably works well because Sharla had to spend time around chris as a coworker with no intent on romance for work purposes, and was able to get used to his personality before they started to see each other as potential romantic partners. If you go into it straight away thinking about dating the person, you are more likely to ignore some of the things that will grow to annoy you, and are more likely to hide your own flaws at first. Sharla got the full chris experience as a coworker, then a friend, so she knew exactly what she was getting into.
Even if you do have a sever allergic reaction to cats, it can be gradually lessened. Has to do with controlled amounts of exposure and a lot (LOT) of hand and face washing. And if all else fails, a bit of Clariton D does wonders😎😎😎. Also, congratulations on your relationship; you and Sharla have always had a nice rapport on camera; i am sure it is 10 times better off. So happy for the both of you; best wishes.
Sound Advice.  My wife and I were really good friends before we started dating and that was 15 years ago.  This October will make 5 years that we've been married, and I can't imagine myself with anyone else.  Good luck to you two.  ❤
Victoria represent!
Sharla on TrashTaste when?  Also guess we gotta call you Chris in Sharla now, huh?  Sorry for the tasteless joke, but what you gonna expect from a TT viewer, innit
I am confused. I thought you broke up.
I was expecting you to say Sugoi when you was in the top box lol
Im not gay either but Conner is sexy.... haha
"I am not gay" ~Abroad in Chris
Thought it was a joke video dang nice
We all know Sharla is Connor in a ironman mechasuit
Your relationship status is none of your viewers business.   But yeah, congrats I guess !
13 years ago, my husband and I also met in costume (not a halloween party, but LARPing...I don't universally recommend that setting for finding a partner 😅), and we've been happily married now for more than 8 years. So...good luck to you two 😉.
This made my day :) absolutely beautiful!
Being from the UK and going to Cananda you might have some documents shortcuts thanks to Commonwealth 😁😁
Why am I not surpised. Oh yeah, because it was BLOODY OBVIOUS. Just saying.  Bad choice though. You live in a country with monstrously beautiful women, and you chose a blondine. Whatever. More choice for me 😀 Please make sure that when you say dating, you actually in love, not just fuck buddies. It happens. It's great. But not for long.
Chris looks so much slimmer damn
Good for you mate
I knew it when she followed him to the UK
I feel like this is an elaborate prank, already talking about hypothetical weddings and stuff straight away (even though you've been dating for a while) seems a bit much a bit quick.  If this is real, I wish you two all the best, you make a great couple.
chris you dirty old man lol
what about ryotaro????
I like how Chris has his priorities straight about why he wouldn't date Connor  1) He doesn't shower  2) He's not gay
I also enjoy the fact that Chris first mentions reasons why he wouldn't date Connor related to Connor's individual traits before emphasizing that he's not gay XD
Connors boyfriend left him
I’m so happy for you guys you guys are the greatest together and in your own videos so I know it’s gonna work out, Now to just get friends so I can start dating them…….
Most allergies are due to human OCD habbits. We have an obsession with cleanliness, which is good, but alsonot. Exposure over time allows our body to build an immunity to certain types of terms and allergies. Keep up your hygiene, but don't scrub yourself raw.
BC is best Canada
I think Ive never even thought about your sexuality watching your videos. You are so talented that I can only focus on the content and your jokes. Congrats Chirs! I dont know her but shes pretty I hope you are both happy. Thanks a lot for entertaining me so much with your videos.
I want to say be careful with making your love life public . A lot of people become obsessed to a disturbing degree.  I'm happy you two found love. Be safe!
Congratulations to you both!
That was wise to wait to speak about being in a relationship. I had a feeeeeeeling since I first saw u guys on journey across Japan. Even if you guys weren't dating. I saw chemistry. I'm happy for you Chris. Sucks for me. Lol I heard I'm not allergic to-maro / tomorrow.
Sharla’s cats are the type of breed that people with cat allergies can handle much better. So that sounds logical 👍🏻 And yes you can grow over your allergies. I have allergies myself also for cats.
I dont know which is sadder, Chris didn't date Connor, or 'we don't want to date Connor"
It was your Cat Documentary that won her over for sure!!!
About damn time. I'm sure you two will be like a magic!
Date a friend. Chris is trying to save the millions of people stuck in the friend zone. What a heroic man.
If y'all get married, at least you guys already have the same last name 😁
like I said on sharla´s video...you guys need to go to SAIKO BAT CAVE
I am actually just starting to watch your Journey across Japan series in full (watched random episodes previously) and it was the first time I met Sharla in your videos. I swear there had to be something more that she was with you during the bike ride across the inland sea. Your first impressions of each other really intrigued me to see more of Sharla and I guess I shipped both of you by the end of that episode. Congrats and I really hope your love works out!
“Is there any benefit to dating a Canadian” you get America Lite Version for better or for worse lmao
Some of us suffer from what they call New Cat allergy. And continued contact with a cat reduces the symptoms. Im so happy you're dating. A bit jealous but happy.
Finally!!! You guys are the perfect couple! Saw it a while back! You have great chemistry And you are so good together Hope you marry one day and have many years of amazing life together!!!
I haven't watched the whole vid yet but I thought Sharla was already married? Congrats I hope you are both content
i was scared it was going to be clickbait/a joke but i'm glad it's real
I could see that shit happening fuckin' 2 years ago, fuck, finally!! GLHF.
"I'm not gay". Yeah, you don't have to be, have you seen CDawg?! The man is god-tier gorgeous. Just remember my handy rhyme "It's not gay if it's with CDawgVA"
Weeb hearts  broken all over the world.   Congratulations Gov'na!
The one stream I miss. Good luck with ur relationship
God bless.
datinginjapan will be the new channel ? :D
I said a couple weeks ago to my bf that you two would be cute together and then a couple days later sharla announced you guys were dating
To be fair to the gay thing, assuming they aren't just messing with you, you guys did visit a few love hotels etc lol I suppose those not paying attention  just went off that.
Your imitation of Pete was spot on.
Chris, I was telling my sister two years ago how you and Sharla would make a really good couple. Can't wait to share this video with her 😂 So happy for both you!
What's with the title lmao
so, you're two timing Connor then? jokes aside i'm happy for you and Sharla!
I recently was wondering if you were dating but didn't know it would be miss Canada :3 congrats happy for you both :3
Chris, I’m sorry, but you have great chemistry with your male friends that looks just like ‘guys who fall in love with their guy friends totally on accident.’ Not with ALL of them, but certain ones.
I'm happy for you both and best wishes . Being friends is a great start.
Hey Chris, have you ever thought about getting allergy desensitizing therapy? It's fairly simple these days, just drops under the tongue.
Lol that's one hell of a socially dangerous ending you left there Chris.
I've always loved Sharla in your videos and vice versa. You guys a great couple. I can only imagine your guys' content getting better because neither of you needs to hold anything back.
What is the music in the background at 3:16? It sounds like the music at the end of his ‘50 Questions’ video that I’ve been looking for for years
Woo hoo on your your relationship which I assumed for a while now :) But the other interesting point to this stream is how awesome Chris's impressions are of Pete and Joey. (Though I remember what you said about your American impression you did during JAJ) But screw em!  More videos of you telling tales of Pete and Joey whilst doing their impression!
Treat her well Chris.. 👀   But yes anyway super happy for you!
That's so nice... but pls tell me you've called Natsuki back. I was almost heartbroken when you said you hung up on him.
We all know that this is just a smokescreen so Chris and Connor’s forbidden love can continue to bloom.
Good on you both. Its nobody’s business but yours and Charlotte’s whether you’re dating. Although it was a bit obvious that you had good chemistry.  Now breathe a sigh of relief. Enjoy!
Lol I fucking knew it from the first time you guys did a collaboration. Chemistry too stronk
Wow that was totally not obvious.
Love the outro!
I knew there was a reason you always rode behind her during your bike rides 🍑🥵🤣
Sharla's video was the ONLY time I've ever squealed with happiness over finding out two people are dating. lol Wish you both the best!
Wait... Connor is Welsh though...
I'm sure a lot of your older videos with Sharla are having numbers climbing all of a sudden (because I'm shamelessly one of those people rewatching you two) and like when I see the way Sharla looks at you, and the way you just tease her relentlessly- it's just too wholesome for my heart to handle. You two look so happy, and man I'm just a sucker for love ;-; <3333
From what I know most people are not allergic to the cat itself but its saliva. And some breeds have more of it and comes on the fur wihle they clean themselfs. So some indoor cats dont clean themselfs so much because they dont have to so you get less allergic reactions to them.  Either way, cheers to some well deserved happiness!
You're clearly dating Connor. You're that Ironmouse vTuber or whatever its name is. Have we ever seen you and Ironmouse in the same room together, at the same time? No. That's sus bro!
5:11 “Is there any benefit to dating someone from Canada?” They can apologize _for_ you, so it actually sounds sincere.
I don't know why I feel the urge to be a snarky asshole when making comments to this channel.  Dat personality brings out the best in me.  In all seriousness though, I watch both of your channels and you both seem like amazing people.  I (and probably a lot of people here) am(are) so happy for you two!
Happy for you guys! Poor Connor :P
Canada welcomes you with open arms Chris! Congrats on the relationship!
As someone who's watched you both for years and couldn't help but notice how much chemistry you have, as soon as I saw the thumbnail I said: FINALLY!
10:24 aren't dating suppose to be like that in the first place? like being friends with someone (of the opposite gender) for few months to years then getting into a relationship?
Chris love to hear it 🤧
You’re not allergic to Maro, but are you allergic today?  Sorry, I just had to. Happy for you two!
Yeah! My bf also became no longer allergic to my cat, but he’s still allergic to all other cats. We foster kittens so he’s always sniffly for a few days and then he’s no longer allergic! I wish I could do that with my lactose intolerance……
finally FINALLY
* Says he would never date Connor * Proceeds to tell the world Connor doesn't shower making him appear less attractive Sure Chris.. we believe you
Perhaps maro and tuna are hypoallergenic cats. I am allergic to cats but after a while I stopped reacting to my sister's cat (which is a hypoallergenic breed)
Nice, you two always had good chemistry on videos. All the best to you! Don't let work get into the way of things too much!
Whaaa I am surprised but happy for you. I don't know much about Sharla, so that's probably why I am surprised ^^  But I am happy you have a good relationship, that's always nice, no matter who it's with :)
Nice going man !
Connor looks real good here
It's the studio, the studio caught her attention 😂
Finally. Gawd. It's like a long term race coming to an end. But now it's a new road and feels amazing. Congrats again Chris, cheers to you both!
Connor screaming YESSS is usable for so much shit lmao
Her ex gotta be absolutely fuming lmao, knowing the guy
Congrats bro!
Bro I legit thought you were gay with that tall dude no cap
Sharla is wonderful in her videos, so great if y'all make cross-overs more
Okay before you said it was the best relationship you ever had, I was getting worried about what you were going to say xD happy for you two!
cant even share a room with a bro in a love hotel without people think you are gay these days lol
I wondered about those two, they seemed to have chemistry on previous videos. Good on them.
FINALLY
Let's be real. If a proper British man such as Chris were to date someone. It'd have to either be a fellow brit(Not happening,  they're just not up to par) or a Canadian.  Out of all the former dominions Canada was the most loyal & reliable! Plus just look at our track record. Were the only nation over 300 years to have never tasted defeat! Where all others fail it's the Canadians who're sent in to do the job. Everyone loves Canada & it's born Canadians. And despite being some of the nicest people in the world with the only  rival being Japan, we're just like the Brits when we throw manners out the window. Canadians are a great option for Chris! Except for the old section of Canada, no one really likes them, not even themselves.
Damn. If such a misserable git like you can tolerate a girlfriend does that mean i need to get one as well? I always looked up to you as my misserable git mentor.. now i am confused and don't know what to do with my life anymore.
Hey this is amazing Chris! Reall happy for you. Also love the pixel animation in the end
I am so happy for both you and Sharla. As a long time viewer of both, I'm just happy to see you both filled with joy. Great luck on your end with the cat allergy! Knock on wood that you don't have to live on allergy meds and your body continues to adjust to her cats. Best of wishes to the both of you!!! 💖
HELL YEAH, now we can just wait for Connor and Mouse, LESGOOOOOOO
its been 9 yrs and I’m still allergic to cats but i still love him. you’re so lucky Chris.
So happy for you! Looking forward to your future! :3
I had always thought you know they have similar ages and personalities that complement each other. It would be really cute if they dated. I had always wondered if you had already dated each other and remained friends or never gotten to that point. You to have great chemistry and it's so nice to see how happy you 2 are to talk about each other! Congratulations 🎊  for announcing to the public!!!!
I still can't tell if they're both taking the piss or they're really actually dating  I suppose, "Why not both?"
Free Maple Sirup, way better Education System as England nd she actualy has interest in u.  aint those 3 enough already ?:P *edit: btw im really happy for u 2 (even thou it was clearly visible from sharlas side the way she looked at u since she came back from korea.) just dont post another 50 videos about this topic. I´ve come across that in all of ur last recent videos nd its cool, but its something private :) so we know it know nd we happy for u 2 ;) nd only reusing scenes from ur last livestream is not the "quality" we expect from u Mr. Broad!
I've had a feeling for years y'all were together lol.  You're just too damn cute together!  My fave celebrity youtube couple lmao.
I called it years ago during the first Journey Across Japan! You two had undeniable chemistry and this random person on the internet is happy for you both!
Sharla gonna be sweating pellets the day OdorDawgVA takes a shower.
@Chris I would love to see a review of Poutine in Tokyo!!!
I love this whole relationship partly because I love both of you individually as creators but mostly because of how awkward you both are about it. Deliciously awkward. It's amazing!
YES!!!!!
You have family here in Montreal!?!? I want to know next time you stop by! 😜 Let's have a 🍻!
You madman even featured the parody video of the announcement. Legend till the end. Cheers to you both!
Tbh if Chris put out a ohh we areee dating, we're sooo supper happy kinda like youtube video my first reaction would be to assemble a rescue party, because he's been clearly abducted by aliens and thats just a bad clone. Now you really need to get Connor a girlfriend, or maybe a rent a mum to hookup :p
Very happy for you both! 🤗
best ship ever
Dating a Canadian automatically makes you Canadian. Congrats! 🍁  Also, can confirm: dating someone you're great friends with is ALWAYS the right choice. ❤
So you found one of the ten blonds with the right age, weight in Japan of 125 million people..?
SMOOTH LIKE A CRIMINAL.
"Why I'm dating a Canadian" "Why the Canadian left me" "Why I'm dating a Welsh man"
Aww this is such great news 💜
"As we discuss dating Sharla In Japan"  not as we discuss dating, as we discuss dating Sharla In Japan specifically.
Can't really say I was surprised when I saw this video 😂So happy for you two!
Not to be parasocial, *proceeds to be parasocial* but I always felt there was a spark between you guys
I am very happy for Cris. I thouth he will die alone, without wife and  children,  in Japan
With the cats thing. That was the same with my husband when we started dating. He was allergic to cats, but after being with me and being mobbed by my cats, his allergies went away. Think the immune system just gets used to it.
If you are going to Banff, you should travel; from Banff up to Jasper, you can easily spend a couple of weeks with all the attractions .
Come visit us in Montreal!!! Please make a video here
Honestly, most couples should take note of how the two of you handled this and how it wasn't a big deal even though it really is big news.  Most of us would have gone "Yeah, that seems right. Good on them!"
The American accent when he impersonates his American friend 😂
I’m going to try and act surprised now 😂
In theory. I guess it makes sense that your allergy goes away after repeated exposure. After all allergies are just you body doing the incorrect response to certain things. We can't all do the same since certain allergies have severe reactions that could lead to dead. But if yours is somewhat mild and expose yourself often, it stands to reason that your body will understand that it doesn't need to react at all.
I fucking knew you two had something going on from the previous videos togheter, was bound to happen
What! Cris the japanese man is dating a Canadian
Sometimes being exposed to an allergy in small bursts will allow your body to build an immunity to said allergy. It happened with my boyfriend and my cat. Eventually, that cat stopped sneezing and itching around him! Thank goodness because I actually liked him.
Nothing better than finding your person. Wise to keep the YouTube savages away from the early relationship.  I wish you all the best, but if you stop eating meat, I'LL UNSUBSCRIBE SO HARD.
Yees.
What's Ryotaro's part in the wedding? Not being invited or something?
Don't buy her sticky notes for her birthday 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't know why this news put such a huge grin on my face. I sent a link to Sharla's reveal with the Connor reaction to my girlfriend and she sent back "I knew it!". We're fans of you both, so it's lovely. All the very best to you guys, from East Anglia.
I mean it was almost obvious. Saw him quite a lot of sharlas videos
This feels like smug man
bro that Pete impression is amazing
I wish you both the best😊! Certain videos of the two of you made me wonder if you were dating but I thought I was imagining a connection.  It was some of the real estate videos and maybe how you seemed to help each other out filming different videos too. It wasn't anything obvious, just a vibe. I hope you have continuing happiness together. I dated my husband for 6 years 😮 before we married so getting to know someone over a long time can be a very good thing😍. Plus it is probably hard to imagine strangers passing judgement about your relationships by comments on videos! Btw, I'm one of many who never thought you were gay. Connor and you have never acted like you had warm, fuzzy feelings about each other. All you have to see is the video of you guys the morning after the stay at the church😂. Let's just say...y'all looked rough. And that morning was NOT your friend😎. Again, all the best for you and Sharla😍. I think you picked a lovely person to be close to. Will we ever get to know how long you have been dating? Hmm 🤔.
look chris a very nice girl meets a great guy most of us were wishing for it for ages it felt like you guys connected. now connor is the only one single from trash taste maybe everyone is feeling for him..
Charlottes cats look like siberians, witch are allergy friendly.
Thought there was chemistry there during Journey Across Japan
A year ago, I wouldn't had a doubt about Sharlas confession. The boys destroyed my trust in vbloggers so much, they dragged down all those around them.
When you date a Canadian, you automatically get poutine in your mailbox once a month. I should know, I'm also dating a Canadian.
I thought you two were a thing years ago just because how the two of you interacted with each other
Good for you, it's always a fun chemistry between the two of you in the vids. Sharla may look a lot nicer than you but when it comes to sarcasm she clearly is on your level and it's hilarious.
I knew it
Since Sharla's cats don't go outside they aren't as likely to cause allergy problems. Congrats by the way.
I thought Chris way gay !
I thought the entire video where the boys react was fake but nonetheless, congratulations :)
Can we wait for your and sharmander to review love hotels.
Did people actually deadass for real think that Chris and Connor were dating??
woaaaa what a bomb :D congrats
im pretty sure most of the comments about chris and connor dating are sarcastic, but its pretty hard to express sarcasm through text
Chris isn't gay, he's just English.
When your OTP is real 😁 Also... The Affable Man + Canadian = An Extremely Pleasant Couple 💘
nice..!!
It's about time to be honest. The chemistry between you two has been crystal clear for years. Congrats and don't f* it up!
Although I never 'ship' people I haven't met, I must admit the news made this hard Finnish woman squee just a little... 😂❤️
You know when you know what your nan has got you for Christmas and then you have to look surprised when you open it..?
Really happy for ya😊
Great news, happy for you both. Never thought you were gay!!!
I'm happy for the both of you
I am happy for you, Chris. I really wish for you that she is your soul mate. I, myself are also seeking for that special someone, but I haven't found her, yet. Regardless, be proud of what you have achieved in life and don't take the relationship for granted.
"I'm not gay" Chris said while wearing a light up rainbow hair band.
Sad to know Connor it's not longer on the line 😔
I i thought England owned Canada?
I am so happy for the both of you! I started dating one of my best friends a year ago and it's the best relationship I've been in, so your advice is sound. :) wishing you both the best! <3
I understand why you kept this to yourselves for a while, there is something special about having something that is just between the two of you without others knowing or involved - and this must be doubly so when you both have thousands of "followers". But its good to finally know, rather than just suspect it :)
It’s not Sharla in Japan, surely it’s Chris in Canada?! 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
Congratulations guy's 😻. You two suit each other. So when are you gonna bring this lovely lass over here to the UK?
So the Yamadera Temple Visit was a proper date out. 🤌
Cutting down on meat... and getting healthy... lmao what an extremely contradicting statement
The community has been pressing these action figures together for a long time saying 'now kith'. They have gotten what they wanted.
I knew it! I knew it as soon as I watched that video when you two drive into the countryside to visit that Temple. The couple vibe was VERY Noticeable.
happy for you mate!
I'll somehow can smell it from far away that this two are dating but i don't have a proof.Great to know that  I'm not crazy. Happy for you guys The Candyman and Sailormoon
Four things- first, strong clinical findings (Gottman et al's research) support the notion that good long-term relationships are built upon a foundation of friendship- plus, that's folk wisdom. Second, successful relationships involve accepting influence from one's partner. Third, Canada is the country of the 21st Century (Just IMO, I'm American, recognize that our neighbor to the North is not a paradise, but simply a modern nation attempting to embrace diversity)! Fourth, its strategic syrup reserve is no laughing matter. Beyond that, good luck to both of you! The chemistry is easy to see.
Chris I am not gay , wearing a hair band
lmao i legit did think chris and connor were dating 😂😂😂 much love to sharla and chris anyway they're my favourite "foreigners in japan" channels 🥰
SO...YOU ARE GAY...
Glad to hear it call came together so naturally for the both of you. Super smart move keeping things private for as long as you did. Been following the both of you for ages. So happy for you guys.
poor connor
Congratulations Chris!
I'm so happy that things are going well for the both of you. I completely agree about the friend dating thing. My boyfriend and I knew each other for 5 years before anything ever happened. We've now been a couple for almost 8 years and I can safely say that this is the best and most comfortable relationship I have ever been in. Looking forward to seeing more videos of the two of you together. 😊
Pretty sure Connor is British, not Canadian.
I married my friend about 9 years ago - I highly recommend.
Waiting for another video why also dating CDAWGVA
Love is in the air
Wonderful news! Longtime follower of you two..Sending love to you both 💜
that Pete impression is on point
To think Chris finally found someone!!!  And i thought he would be a grumpy old single man
Oh come on, it was so obvious from the other side of the world
Chris darling we knew for a long time
One might say it's blasphemous for Chris to move away from fried chicken, but great job for the effort Chris, good to know that I'm not alone with tackling dietary problems.
Japanese girls had 10 years to make their move on Chris, and they blew it!  Congrats on the new relationship, man! ❤️
Is conor gay?
Congratulations 👏 💐  I wish you the best. 🙂
Chris is not gay, he's English.  /s
chris is not gay. yet.
what's a Canadian?
I kinda knew it. Congrats to you and Sharla.
Good luck with bread girl, and wish you both the best!
The clip would have been more legit if Conor looked devastated in this . LOL
I am so happy for you both 🥰🥰 I know Sharla has been through some hard times so this is lovely news and wishing you both the best ❤️
I'm so happy... For you and Sharla!  Two of you are some of my most favorite Youtubers!
cheers!
So happy for you Chris! I know some of it's a joke but the stuff with Connor is so annoying. They either ship people with him or say they feel bad for him. Nothing  is wrong with being single. Idk why people think everyone that's single is sad. So dumb. Lol
Just be happy.
Good for you, mate!
The American voice Chris did gives me life
Affable!
Find a Canadian, we make superior dating partners.
She found him affable.
I'm ecstatic for you both 😊👍
I don't understand! Why let being heterosexual get in the way!
Congratulations Chris you deserve to find happiness
I’ve been to Victoria Island and it was a great time. They had a botanical garden there I think and I really enjoyed it. Pay it a visit if you go!
Because you are british
I only saw the tweet that sharla made that hinted that she broke up with you because you Don't respond to messages and have been sooo confused
You guys are super cute together! Congrats!
I knew it! I love both of you two this is awesome!
Cheers mate
DAI SHOURI!
Finally!
As a queer, Jesus Christ non-queer people have no gaydar. There's never been romantic or sexual vibes w any of your male friends lmao
A bit of a weird or stupid question but my thirst for unnecessary knowledge overtakes me sometimes so: which makes it more weird; a western couple with their inherent dating habits etc in japan, or a japanese couple with jadajada?
If you and Charla decide to have a child in japan, the child will have Japanese, British and Canadian citizenship.
OMG CHRIS!!!
#1 We (Americans) don't sound like that...LOL #2 I never got the impression you were gay...why do people say that? LOL #3 Screw everyone else...do what makes you happy! Congrats!
It sort of explains why Chris would always be in the background (and sometimes foreground) on Sharla's travel videos most of the time. I was starting to wonder if there was stalking going on.
I`m so happy for you man :)
super happy for you guys. it just makes sense.
Will the next announcement be Conner and Shibuya Kaho? hmmm. lol.
Yay , Chrisyboi ain't a boi
Ha! I knew it!!!
Well it’s about time Chris! You gotta thank Ryotaro for being the wingman lol
"why I'm dating a canadian" sounds like you commited a sin and you're trying to justify it
Congrats! Love you both!
Sweety if your family is in Quebec and hers is in BC you're gunna spend more money traveling from one side of the county to the other than you would traveling from Japan to Canada in the first place xD It sucks but welcome to Canada.
Chris "dating" a girl to cover up his relationship with Connor is a smart maneuver, truly a wise man
Boys, the ship has sailed. *Salutes*
It's about time!
Happy if you are happy
Why did I think Sharla was being sarcastic in her video??? Lol So happy for both of them 😊
FINALLY the content we've been asking for! Lol really happy for you love 💕💕 it's about time 😒🤷🏽‍♀️🤣
We have a clear answer! We now know that Connor and Chris have unfortunately broken up.      Ok but seriously though, its kinda scary how many people can't understand a joke. Glad both of you feel comfortable in letting this be known. I'm sure Sharla's fans and your will still keep watching regardless, maybe even expect a few bigger view counts whenever the respective party makes an appearance on each other's channels.
I thought I was allergic to cats for years. Turns out I was allergic to the dust they roll around in.
Apples, innit o/
The cracks towards Connor never get old!
It warms the cockles of my bitter heart to see that even the typically-snarky Chris stop and be like "yeah definitely the best relationship I've ever had" ❤️ y'all have always had such good chemistry
bill burr told you could never really be a friend with a woman. I mean really be a friend. Might have to re think that after this.
Hahahaha. Kinda knew you guys got something going on.
9:25 The only real answer is Ryotoro
wait, connor doesn't shower???
Not maidenless?
Congratulations!! You guys make a great couple, wish lots of happiness. Also P.S. love the phrase "I'm not gay personally" I'm gonna start using that. Cheers!!
Why do people go straight to marriage questions when they find someone is dating. Let them have fun for a while... sheesh
Chris broad is ironmouse confirmed?
My girlfriend and I talked for about 3 straight months before we actually got to go on our first date, during that time of course we flirted and showed feelings but wanted to make sure we didn't have the disaster you described of telling all our friends and family we're dating and then suddenly break up, it's been just about 5 years and now we have our own apartment together.  He ain't lying about the dating a friend
I knew it, the moment chris and sharla in that strawberry picking.. the way sharla look at chris at that moment is just diff..
BUT WHAT ABOUT CONNOR?!??!?!?
Congratulations Chris!
I can't tell if this is satire
Happy for you guys! My partner was allergic to cats but I basically forced her to get over it 😂 we've been living together for three years with my furbaby and the allergies have gone away.
YEAH BABYY THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FORRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
Connor never showers? Who is in the bathtub in almost every wacky weekend? You're dating Connor DO NOT DENY IT!
That title is amazing chris. lol
Just the best for you two 😍 with many years of fun and love together 💚
some cat breeds cause less allergic reaction
Yes.... Yes.... Yes... 🥵
love you guys💗💗
The fact that chris talked about Vancouver,Whistler and Victoria made me so happy coming from someone who is from Vancouver because never expected any YouTuber I watched to mention it.
Hi Chris!  I am on Vancouver Island and can confirm, it's beautiful!  There are quite a few lovely places here to see.  I didn't know Sharla was from here!
I told her too in a comment years ago your welcome Chris !
So awesome and wholesome
Why do my guy connor like that
An Englishman dating a Canadian who both live in Japan sounds like the start of a bad joke
It's funny how Sharla wants to live in the UK and Chris in Canada 🇬🇧🔄🇨🇦
They are at least dating since they had to make each other sweets for Valentines day at a Tokyo creative video. They really cared about each others presents 😍
Don't be fooled, Chris just dates Sharla as a immune therapy to finally being able to touch cats and this is how his doctors and all of youtube japan will cover it up. So in the end of this, natsuki will step in and during an epic monologue where he fights against Ryotaro with bread sticks, he explains to Chris, that Joey is organizing a party and he should go there alone and then there is just Connor, waiting for him, with a cat on his arm. And then the picture fades to black and everything is left for youtubes imagination.  Or the video might just be true, either way good luck you two ^-^
She seems like a nice girl! Good on ya there chap!
And Conn needs to kind up 😙❤️🤗
Let me tell you what's going on in Canada, nothing...
CONGRATULATIONS!!
UwU
wishing you every happiness. Glad you've found someone.
Connor is with ironmouse anyways and we all know you are ironmouse 🤣 jkjk
Congratulations man, happy for the two of you.
New rule: if you do an American accent, it needs to be Pete. 10/10
Hey if it works then it works out! Good for you both!
Yay! thought for a good while that you two might have been dating / casually seeing eachother, so to see this confirmed just makes me super happy for you both, you're both "a catch" and very cute together, all the best to you both! :)  Happy for you bud
This was a fun video. I’ve been fans of you both for such a long time. It’s so great to see that you guys are enjoying such a wonderful healthy relationship together. Thank you for sharing.
I'm so Happy for you Chris. Truly.
Honestly, your chemistry together was always good on video at least. I kinda suspected this would happen eventually, if she didnt marry natsuki.
IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONEEE
OF COURSE you'd go for Natsuki! He's AWESOME!!
Congrats Chris! I wish you both well!
Yeah sometimes allergies better over time, it's a mystery innit. Some cats are less allergy inducing that others though. It has to do with the proteins in their spit. None cats are truly hypoallergic, but some certainly triggers way less symptoms. You're stuck with the cats she has now, but in the future - even if you react less now - I would suggest looking for one of those breeds. Because allergy isn't just about dealing with the symptoms as they happen, they also influence the imune system and can over time cause things like asthma and COPD.  But the real mystery here is why the fuck would you buy 50 grams of plastic just to get 100 grams of apple. Can't you just get an apple like a normal person? Cheers mate, and good luck with what looks to be an awesome relationship, I wish you a happy time together.
I'm not gay... Not that there's anything wrong with that
Shabroad 🤗 as I named you a long time ago! Finally!  But! Don't get me wrong!  I'll sweep in and take gentle care of him the minute you're gone, beautiful Sharmeloen!  😙❤️🤗  I'm so happy on your behalf! You're just the cutest couple I could ever wish to see! 😄  🥰❤️💕
Good for both of you.  It's nice that you started out as friends first.  Also probably seen each other really gross during the bicycle travel so you got that out of the way.
love it! Looking forward to the best love triangle of you two and conner 😂    but honestly very happy for the two of you ☺️
Chris you have to take a trip to Banff with Sharla. It’s so picturesque and it’s as beautiful as the photos
Finally, saw this one coming.
Congratulations! :)
Chris may not be gay but that coloured headband is just a tad fabulous 😉
so happy for you and David
the sweet sweet maple syrup
Cat allergies totally can go away with time and exposure! I don't know about ALL of the time. With each of my two cats I had mild allergies for a few days, and now, their fur is basically fused into everything/everyone I know and love, and I have no issues. (Also, congrats on two of my favorite youtubers dating :) )
So happy for you guys!❤❤
I love how Sharla brings out the brighter side of you and you bring out the sarcastic side of her 😂 You complement each other well!
I well I was going with it for the bit but Connor could still be a misstress
So I don't usually care for who youtubers are dating but I am genuinely really happy for you both, I have followed you all for quite a while and I'm excited for you both! And as a random stranger from Trinidad and Tobago (a place you've never heard of but is 100% real) you have a fan who has shipped you all since she started appearing in your videos.
uh ohhhh... sounds like wacky weekend is canceled o.O
The British are trying to reunite their empire
Connor is probably crying
The gang were so happy in the intro
Those reactions are so fucking cringe. Like what the hell? Gratz BTW...
The Banff picture you showed is Moraine Lake which is closer to Lake Louise. This valley is called the valley of the 10 peaks and used to be on our money.
Makes me happy to see Chris get so excited when talking about  Sharla , so wholesome ❤️🥹!!
Awesome! Congratulations Chris!
Not that I thought you were dating Monke, but I'd just like to put out a reminder that a guy who dates guys isn't always gay 💗💜💙
Looks like ironmouse spirit returns to its original body, Congrats Chris your finally free 😆
ConnerdogVA is not canadian! also we could see that energy a while ago you and Sharla make an adorable couple. 98% of the the connor comments are in on the joke, the other 2% just makes the joke funnier.
Wait what - Sharla wasn't joking? This isn't a bit?
happy for you and you best show her the amzing thing called crumpets or us brits will dissown you lol
Cheers, guys! Wish you both the best!
Because you're both angloids
But how much does she pay for your appearance fee?  2 or 3 pieces of Chicken?
Christopher, I'm 42 and just moved to Fukuoka 😂 I don't have Friends - yet
Connor screamed so loud at the beginning that he was drowned out
Saw this coming MILES AWAY  But yeah, finally the cat is out of the bag. Congrats to you two.
Hy Chris I am Portuguese follower and I have been following your videos and Sharla for 2 or 3 years I am not certain, but, it doesn´t matter :-) I hope that everything goes well with your relation. ...  Maybe one day you can come to visit Portugal, it's a small country but very beautiful and with one of the best food of the world.
Congrats it's awesome to hear you two are doing good.
did it start when sarla evolved to better pokemon?
I knew it
CONGRATS SHARLA AND CHRIS IN JAPAN!!!
Connor is writhing in pain
Reminder that they are only dating. I wish only the best for both of you, and that things go smoothly for a greater future.
Cool.  of the people I watch about japan, you are #1.  I love how you edit and create you videos.  #2 is Connor, sometimes.  Some of his videos ,cough cosplay,  are not what I watch.  #3 is Sharla.  Love the weekend videos with you and Connor.  Don't go overboard of videos with you and Sharla, keep it as private as you can.  I do look forward to an occasional video though!  Have fun, good luck, and just enjoy.
Yess!!! My wife and I have been hoping that was the case! Congrats Chris!
So happy for you both!!! You two are so adorable together!!!!!!!
Conner right now 😥😢😭
Finally!!!
I'm so happy for you guys!
"Couple in Japan"
Not going to lie their reaction made me smile 😂. Wasn’t expecting to find their reaction so wholesome. I’m not someone who cares at all who people date, or gets invested in a strangers personal lives, especially someone I don’t know in person, and particularly a YouTuber… But this was damn wholesome, and I’m happy for you both!
F  I n n a l l y !  best wishes, y'all two are great.
power couple
Congratulations😊
7:00 - Sharla back then was a hottie!
Hoping for more couples content for ideas of things my wife and I can do on our next trip to Japan! Congrats to you both on the blooming relationship!
The first time I saw Sharla in your videos I thought you both had amazing chemistry. So very happy for you both.
It makes a lot of sense but that's awesome! Good for you guys. Connor may get a little jealous though lol
Re the cat allergy, I had the same thing. I was brought up with cats in the home, no allergy.  Then a few years after I moved out I developed a big cat allergy, my eyes would swell up so badly I was blind.  Then I started dating a guy with cats and spent most of my days round his place taking loads of antihistamines, and within a couple of months my allergy was gone.  Then we split up and I'm allergic to cats again!
Abroad in love 🤩
Awesome, you wont be a lonely old man after all.
What i wonder is how does it feel for you Mr Broad to date someone older and wiser than you are? All jokes aside, I'm really happy for the both of you! Best of luck
Sharla has definitely good relatable vibes hence we all feel at peace with the news! Congratulations.  Also, does anyone knows what the outro banger tune is? I can't seem to find any details in the description(s).
Chris you don't have allergy to the fur of cat but rather it's saliva. Just that it spend half of its time grooming itself.  Also Congrats btw
Wow sharla in Japan is dating iron mouse?
I have also noticed that my cat allergy has greatly diminished over the last few years. Most cats don't actually bother me much anymore.   Also, congrats! I was sort of wondering if that was going to happen.
i like that you pick the clip that I watch for the announcement. all of the expressions there is me when I heard about jt.
YESSSSSSSS!!! I hope you guys have SO MUCH HAPPINESSSS togetherrr! <3 <3 <3
I thought it was a joke
“The guy doesn’t shower” Chris speaking about Connor 2022 😂😭😂😭
I am Canadian - one advantage? You get to say "I am sorry" a lot! lol
I'm jelly lol Im glad you are not gay even though you stole my girlfriend 🤷‍♂️🙈😂.... But where did you get the glasses... I need some.
I started watching Sharla years before I started watching you so now that you are together it’s like full circle for me hahahaha I knew this was a thing when you guys went on the bike ride video
I thought you were dating when I watched you two cycle on journey across Japan, I was surprised when I learned you want. Then now you are so I guess I saw it coming
great you move to japan just to date another white person lol
Good for you. Love that head band.
My dude, link the outro music please.
Yes, and have access some pretty good coupons...nice
Congrats, wishing you two all the best! Also glad to hear that the cat allergy seems to calm down a bit when it comes to Sharla's cats. Happened to me with mine, too. Terribly allergic, took in two cats and over the course of half a year my body stopped reacting to them.
Sorry for Connor
Very happy for you two, best wishes! When are we getting "Taken for Garnted"?
I always thought you two were dating for the longest time . I could always see it. SO HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU. This made my day. Love to both of you <3
so happy for you Chris, sadge for Connor, but you gotta do whats best for yourself.
And this is why a guy and girl can never be “just friends”. I have the debate with my partner all the time   Congrats though!  👏
You both have great chemistry! So happy for you both! Congrats! Wish you all the best! Look forward to more videos on both of your channels 😀 affable couple ❤
So you stopped dating Connor? Poor thing...
Surely Connor would shower if you DID date him, right?. Sacrifices must be made on either side. I grew up on Vancouver Island, which has pretty cool people on it. She's a keeper ;)
All I am thinking is, how miserable you have to feel as foreign man in Japan to NOT be able to land a sweet little Japanese female ?
I'm so jealous that you get to see Maro and Tuna regularly
Highly Highly recommend Banff. That national park is probably the best most beautiful place I have been.
so this leaves Connor as the sole lone wolf of the TT Gang  COME ON CONNOR CHASE THAT GREMLIN DEVIL!!
You dont have to tell anyone about your private life man, dont feel pressured like you have to. People need to resopect boundaries and your private life. Wishing the best for you two!
I fucking knew it!!
Thanks for sharing, good strategy to wait a while to have some peace together
Chris' Pete impression is spot on
is this technically a case of escaping friendzone
HavE yOu TRieD BEiNg gAY?!?  Daft fans will always be daft, glad for you mate, cheers!
The signs already apeared months ago. I remember i commented about it, in one of your video when you collaborate with her.
Scandalous!!!
saw this on my notification and clicked the video directly, thought that it was some kind of clickbait coz well its chris...anyways nice! kinda wasnt expecting this but after i saw your "My Apartment vs. Japan's BIGGEST Earthquake in 10 Years" video back on March 22, 2022 was wondering to why sharla was there also instead of bringing natsuki and a different male friend like ryotaro, joey or connor, so from there i started feeling that you guys were dating and my feeling was right. im happy for you guys!
WAIT, I AM CONFUSED, I THOUGHT CHRIS LIKED CONNOR? I THOUGHT CHRIS WAS GAY? WHY DID CHRIS SAY CONNOR WAS HIS BOYFRIEND?
The title 🤣🤣
Aww, I'm very happy for you two!! ☺
I KNEW IT!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 amazing!!!!
Dang. There goes all my hopes and wishes dashed against the rocks of despair. 😫  Granted, I don’t think I had much of a chance with Chris considering I’m over 60 and long married, but still.  Signed, The Despondent President of the Chris Fan Club - Senior Citizen Division
Chris has been upgraded from GAY to BI
The Boys going crazy over this.
My gf, now for 2,5 years, was one of my best friends for 3 years before we started dating, and yep, makes a good pairing and a good relationship. Cheers, man.
The actual unsinkable ship. The chemistry has been immaculate. Goes without saying so much that I didn't even say it at first, but I'm happy for you both and I think this is great. This is good news in 2022.
I felt it in the videos with you two for a while lol. Congrats!
I genuinely thought Chris was dating CDawg. They always seem to be staying in love hotels together ❤️ 💕
Congrats to you both!  It''s always good to start as friends.  My wife and I were friends first for a couple years, now we've been married for 17 and have been together for 21 years.
"Date a friend" is a really good advice, especially if you're mature enough to be able to continue your friendship even if the dating doesn't work out.  A lot of people I know would rather date a complete stranger rather than a friend, even if it makes less sense, just to avoid the chance of "ruining" a friendship in the  case of a bad breakup.   Also, Congratulations Chris & Sharla! Happy for you two.
I remember you mentioning in a super early video that you were inspired by Sharla's videos about Japan, how surreal does it feel to now be dating? That is freaking wild! Happy for you both! Also kinda surprised she'd date you after the whole roller coaster thing, I thought she would have hated you forever for that.
I agree with keeping private life private even though you both "work" a public job so to say. That being said making it public also makes it more serious as now you don't have to cut,edit and cencor each other and can just focus on creating ingenious content true and honest. It's really healthy in any profession to keep your private life private. All the best to you and future and endeavours.
Happy for the both of you. Saarland is the Starsky to your Hutch.
Sharla for next trash taste guest!
Chris overcame his cat thing with the power of love yeahhh
I honestly thought it was a bit
"Are u gae? - I'm not gay - Why are u gae?"
Now I'm allowed to act like a teenager and say: Let's goooo!
this is so cool!
I'm so dumb 😭 I thought Sharla was joking when she said they were dating because she was laughing so much in her video. Happy for both of them though ❤
This is so great! Happy for you both!! What a perfect match. Been watching both of your channels since 2017…glad this finally happened. Congrats🎉
Nothing but support to yall i'm so happy for you!!
that was a great pete impression!
💓💘💖💕❤🧡💚💛💙💜🤎🖤🤍❤‍🔥
TRUCKER BLOOD 💪💐🎊🙌
Love the title!
This was well done. Not the dating Sharla, or the dating a Canadian thing, although I heartily approve both (and of course the approval of random Canadians around the globe is immensely valued and valuable), but the tone. Don't get me wrong, I adore Snarky Chris as much as anyone, but some things are just better handled with a modicum of tact and gentle humour and LED headbands. Relationship goals indeed. Also, these guys are cute as heck. 😁👍 ETA plus, great meet cute story. Although ... candyman really does have different meanings in different cultures. _Cough, cough._
If you follow both long enough, yeah we saw this coming.
1:57 i'm so glad that you two are together <3 but i didn't know that Connor was Canadian, i always assumed that he was Welsh
So happy for you both!   I 100% agree with you in being friends first before dating.
this is so heartwarming to see your friends being so supportive
I had allergy testing done a few weeks back and found out I have a slight allergy to cats. This was a surprise because I've had my cat for 16 years. I always sneezed a ton when brushing her and now I know why. Allergies are weird.
i was heartbroken when you and david broke up
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🎉 Congrats.  I was noticing you where starting to trim down again. Trying to get look good in the bathroom mirror? 😉
Happy news during sad times. R.I.P fried chicken.
I'm concerned on why no one is noticing your sarcasm. You and sharla both are being Hella sarcastic when stating you're dating each other.
LETS GOOOOOO. I'm so happy for both of you!!!
1:55 the footage speaks for themselves, triangle confirmed!
Ahhh! So happy for y’all
So, your channel will become Abroad in Canada? Will we see some Journet across Canada?
Exposure therapy is very real for allergens!
You two are awesome man!  It's really cool.
I’m so happy for you guys. It’s being great seeing you both. You’ve grown so much through your years we’ve got see you.  To be honest. I also thought your where bi, sorry about that.  I’ve also thought Sharla is Canadian Guy from the Learn Japanese in a couple of months.
Interracial dating, I'm okay with, dating the same gender is okay too, but Chris, I really have to say that I don't approve of you dating a Canadian. You have to draw the line somewhere.
They already have the same surname "in Japan"
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsssssssssssssss!
I guess new viewers of chris didnt know that connor and chris dating was a meme
i have a cat allergy too but i've been living with one for a year and a half now so my allergies have gone down loads
Congratulations Chris! Very happy for youse! Love from Ireland
Chuffed to bits for both of you.  The last few years have been one hell of a ride especially for the two of you.  I wish you both all the best of luck and happiness for the future!!!!
YASSS!!!!!! This is awesome news!!!
But he's british, Sharla! He's british and he lost the revolutionary war!!!
WHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT????? Im genuinely Happy!!!
Honestly advice I wish I had taken. Congrats to the both of you :)
I like how you word the title as if dating a Canadian is something morally wrong 😂
That might've been the biggest unsurprising surprise I've seen in a while.  It might've just been me, but it all seemed like a natural fit, so I just kind of assumed it was the case in my head.
Poor Connor 😭😭😭/s
So sad to see your relationship with Connor end with another relationship.
I knew it the whole time.
❤️❤️❤️
It's so generous of Chris to be helping out smaller youtubers :^)
This is so wholesome. Happy for you both and that you have such supportive friends around you! <3
You two really are meant to be! So cute
Too the cat allergy thing: There is such a thing as exposure therapy, so thats indeed a real thing and there is some science to it. Doesnt work for everyone, but it can absolutly work.
chris not dating connor cause chris isn’t gay: ❌  chris not dating connor cause connor doesn’t shower: ✅
Natsuki your best man? Like a magic..
Dating, finally!! Thank god! He’s no longer a virgin…. Hopefully.
''Date a friend''... Yea that's kinda what I'm doing xD  Me and my partner met over a year ago online through FFXIV. About 3-4 weeks ago now, I went over to visit him in Scotland after we had been together for 4 months. And for each passing day we fell more in love with each other and now I can't wait until I see him again <3
Great advice to date the homies
Now i’m double jealous of chris
Well congratulations bud👍 you did the one thing I can not do. Well done bud hope all goes well👍  I am currently working on my fitness and conversation to be more appealing to women. They love my gentleman’s moustache but i still need to be better. It’s been hard over the last 5 years as my disabled dad sadly died now my 12 year old dog who is like a brother to me has now passed away. My confidence and general well-being is at a low but i want to be better so i can make them proud of me and hope this year i can finally get a proper date again.  Not looking for sympathy as we all go through hardships in life just wanted to be more open as it helps my confidence in talking to strangers even if nobody replies.
All this great stuff, all from a slice of bread.
R.I.P Connor's heart 🤣
Cheers to the cutest couple in Japan!
hell yeah bro, so it's a combination Relationship + Physical Gains arc, you got this!
Poor connor 😂
Congrats!! I’m genuinely happy for you, something I don’t usually have for other YouTubers. I wish the best for you guys though.
how does she put up with the nagging? chris is male karen too often!
I knew it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Been watching for years. All I can say is, FINALLY!
Friendzoned for 7 years. Brutal.
Fucking rascal! My man! And it showed immediately when you guys did! 👍🏻👍🏻🔥
Congrats to you both, Mr. and Mrs. In Japan!
A really happy time :D Congratulations =)
I had an inkling they were dating when she moved to Sendai. They have great chemistry and you could tell by the way they looked at each other they were close and had a great bond. You  two are great for one another. Wishing you both much happiness x
Yesssss!!!! So happy for y’all!!
i think chris takes any chance he gets to brag about his Halloween costume
Chris has lost so much weight, looks better and better
Congrats to you both. From a Brit in Canada, 16 years now. Originally from Essex...........Where I am (Central) Wpg..... Its the same as ESSEX! What did I do? lmao
@Sharmeleon is changing her name to Sharla in Japan
"ChriSharla" Abroad in Japan! 😁
oh shit it was real?
Congratulations! So happy for you both!
🎉❤🎉
It's a miracle ay
why would conner be upset?  isnt he dating kaho?
Canadians are just Americans with manners
I’m always amused that YouTubers are pressured to formally announce this stuff. It’s kinda been obvious that Chris and Sharla are a couple… 🤭 Happy for you two!
It's actually 七夕 festival for us Chinese,which is the equivalent to westerner's Valantine's day, so what a day to announce it on! Wish all the best!
Its the free maple syrup
Had a feeling when you and Sharla cycled across Shimanami Kaido 😉
Yes Chris and Sharla what amazing news I hope you both have so much happiness 💕
Happy for you both and yet you shouldn't have had to make this video it's nobody's business who or why you date but best of luck to you both
I subscribed all those years back just to see this happen, my task has been completed, i shall move on.... no no I'm staying, hommie got another journey across Japan coming up 😱 congratulations fam! 🤣🤣
Because you only scored 8 out of 26.
...Okay.   All the best to you both!   Anyway...
Sharlas Q&A video made me so happy! I had my suspicions for quite a while now and am so happy for both of you! Have been watching you both for about 7-8yrs which is mindblowing. Almost met Sharla back in 2017 at a pokémon go event in Victoria but my friend doddled for too long and I missed her :(
I always knew there was something 🙂. You've always treated her a bit differently than any of your other guests. It's subtle, but there. Even in the original Journey Across Japan videos. I'm genuinely happy that it's actually happened through - I think you're both great for each other
Congratulations 🥳 i was hoping when she moved down to sendai
why. cause she's super cool and super cute. It's awesome!
"over time my allergy went away" that's love bro
Congratulations! You make a great couple! 👍
You're a good match for each other. You both look like hamsters.
I actually studied in China to stress test my relationship with my now wife, if I can move to China, live with her for 6 months, not kill each other over money, stress, studying pressure on me, she being tired from work, and actually being able to live together, then she is a woman I was ready to marry, and so I did, last year.   Caring for eachother, liking eachother,  enjoying being together to me means nothing if you can not live together. I throw my socks everywhere xD that is one of my quarks, I can change of course, but if we live together without major issues, then that is great. I had a GF that thought that every I wanted to fart I should go to the bathroom, I refused, and we are not together because of farting. :-D life is strange, enjoy it man. Congratulations.
but what will connor do? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m allergic to cats but exposure seems to help. I’m going for a shower now, I’m too Scottish for all this emo stuff…especially sober! 😬
Wait , when did they start dating, I didn't get it x'D
happy for u man! stop been so gloomy now ya haha
You guys should do a journey across Canada series! BC to Newfoundland!
Yeah, I think we all knew this for a while, mate. 😆
Took your time to announce!
Connor is being such a good sport about this!
Kinda exciting to think I stand a chance of meeting you two. People to come to Canada, sadly, rarely go to the West Coast. It’s usually all about Toronto and Montreal.
I knew it
“He have this philosophy where he doesn’t shower” Bro, that’s called depression, check if Connor needs help
I usually don't care much about youtube couples but I've been watching you and Sharla for years, and this news makes me happy for the both of you :) cheers 🍻
Happy for both of you, enjoy!
A plum drink? Shit that sounds interesting
Chris Broad of Abroad in Japan got himself a broad in Japan that isn't a broad from Japan.
Congratulations Chris! I`m dating a Canadian girl myself (I`m dutch), and can confirm they are the best!
So Chris is actually Iron Mouse and Sharmeleon is actually Connor.... Chris & Connor dating confirmed!
"Date a friend..." Damn. Now I have to go make some friends.
Why is he still saying he isn't gay
WAIT?! You and Sharla are dating?! Well seeing you two on the Journey Across Japan and other videos on the channel, your chemistry is infectious so i think you two are perfect together :)
I do believe you're more likely to have a successful relationship with somaline you're already friends with. It makes sense because you've already gotten to know them so making an informed decision about dating is a lot easier. I do want to say that it doesn't guarantee a successful relationship either just for anyone younger who might assume it would.
"Some people thought Connor and I are actually dating, I would never date Connor!" yeah, totally what someone that's dating ConnorDawgVoiceActor would say. 🤔
Bout time!
Congrats to the both of you.
I fucking new it
"I'm not gay" -- Chris Broad 2022
Finally we know! Many cheers to you guys, you make the perfect combo: a nice Canadian with a snarky Englishman.
I imagine an episode of the podcast with Sharla and you while Pete asks awkward questions.   Pete: "How often do you smooch? Is Chris a good smoocher? Connor hasn't given a proper answer"   Sharla and Chris: "*internally* oh boy, this was a bad idea"
chris is a broad
Dating charla in Japan> Dystopian future > cyberpunk bar talk
when youre excited because Mr. Affable released a new video but youve already seen the livestream SADGE
i’ve watched both you guys for a long time and it’s so nice that you guys are happy together! hope the cat family treat you well lol
To be honest somehow people on the internet always think British people are gay  Seems like not being allergic to the cats means it's destiny. And I heard Sharla has part Dutch ancestry, she kinda looks like some people I know from the Zeeland province if that's of any interest to you.
IT ALL MAKES SENSE AND LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
I knew this was coming from the videos a few months ago where you guys are together. The vibe was just there. Congrats!!
Awesome
Good for you both! It's your life. I just want you guys to be happy ♡
Explains why Sharls was treated better than any other guest in the Studio or out and about.  But in honesty, I really hope you two have many, many years of fun, happiness & laughter together. Coming from a man with the name Chicken in it so you know these words are good and wholesome.
ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!
hmu for great greek restos in montreal
Congrats Chris!! I wish you both much happiness!! You deserve it!! Too happy for you both!!
NO WAY. MY SHIP HAS COME HOME. Congrats and glad to hear it :)
Hey!! Congratulations!! I'm super happy for you both!! Channel life goals! ❤❤
Wheres the Livestream VOD?
tier of wisdom:  1. Maro 2. Tuna 3. Chris   p/s astrobot incident.
My man!
My fiance's got cat allergies, but somehow isn't bothered by the cat she's had for-fucking-ever. Sometimes if the cat sits right in front of her face she'll get a little stuffed up, but that's about the worst of it.
Happy for both of you Chris!
There had been something brewing there for a long ass time. I'm surprised it took them so long. Or I guess I should say I'm surprised it took Sharla so long since I'm pretty sure Chris was into her from the start. Then gave up..  and now they are together lol
Banff is amazing, I was just there this summer and it was easily the most beautiful natural scenery I've ever seen.
High fives all around. But yeah, don't talk about it.
Congratulations!!!!! The only other I couple I know are a couple in Canada, but I had a suspicious that they were dating since they were together every new year, and actually a lot, and they first said so when they got married and moved in together. And for me, that is a perfect time :-D but hey, congratulations man.
you guys fuckin
I agree that you should be very cautious about how much of your private life you share with the internet as not to have relationship issues all in the open. That being said, from the moment you two appeared on the screen together for the first time, I always thought you'd make a cute couple, so I'm VERY happy for you two and wish you all the best going forward! You both deserve a kind a loving partner and in my opinion you complement each other wonderfully!
People confuse bromance with romance... Its funny tho. Happy for you and Sharla, Chris! Cheers
Chris you sailor you !
ah yes all my inappropriate presumptuous comments have been validated
I like that the first reason Chris wouldn't date Connor is because Connor doesn't shower and not because they're both straight men.
Y’all are so cute
Whatta a shocking revelation! #notsomuch (Everyone had a pretty good ideia that it was happening for a while!)
We your audience new for awhile the both of you were dating. Thanks opening up about it.
My ship sailed!  :)  I shipped them 3 years ago in a comment on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS-rvjd_36w&t=264s I win lots of internets! xD
Good for both of you. Both of you are cool people, and I hope it all works out fine :)  Don't be scared of therapy if things get a bit messy.
Oh delighted for you! Ive been a fan of you guys for a few years now, so im glad you both have found each other. Much love to you both
the title sounds like an apology
i have no friends, how to date?
Jeez, the Connor x Chris joke is only within Trash Taste, people who are new to TT or only an Abroad in Japan fan (maybe), didn't get it was just a joke. Sorry about that Chris but also thanks for being cool about it this whole time lol. So happy we have confirmation #2! So happy for you and Sharla. ☺
We all know Sharla and Connor are the same person
Incredible happy for you two, all the best!
You know you have good friends when they react to you having a girlfriend like people watching a Star wars trailer
I'm also allergic to cats, but when I was little we rescued one anyway. My boy just turned 20 this year! Other cats still trigger my allergies, but mine doesn't affect me anymore. You'll be the best cat dad!
He was planning this ever since he saw her eat that white bread way back when. I just know it.
I can't believe you've been using Conner this whole time. Literally shaking and crying RN
Aww, I wish you both the best and many happy days ahead in your relationship.
Good for you chris 🇨🇦   Double date with Natsuki and his wife  When  Rip Connor
Love ya both 😍❤
I. Have been waiting. And secretly rooting for. This moment. For yeeeaaaars!
Damn now connors the only single trash taste member
On your wedding day, after placing your hands in the pudding of togetherness you get a Moose!
3:40 low grade exposure is one way to get your immune system to stop overreacting to allergens. It only works sometimes, though. There's a wives tale that taking local honey in small doses that contains local pollens is one way to beat seasonal allergies where you live, it could be similar with your cat allergy.
I had a hunch, but it became clear when you went to look your studio after the earthquake hit it, with Natsuki and Sharla.
Seven years ago in a beautiful Japanese gorge
This is so awesome chris. When I watched journey across japan with you and sharla, those were my favorite episodes.  You had such chemistry and she laughed at everything you said.  And I think I even sent a message to you asking you to date this girl or you`re a moron. Im so glad this happened. Big HAPPINESS FROM NORWAY. :D :D :D
What I need is Sharla on Abroad in Japan podcast. That'd be fun
Why Chris's Pete impression is so on point
You were supposed to be ironmouse for connor
Purely to be contrarian, I don't care.
I thought I sensed a connection there in that video where you both visited the Yamadera mountain temple. You two just seemed like a great fit. Really happy for you both, and wish you two all the best now and in the future!
Very cool development, knew there was chemistry on that journey across Japan and now I’m proven correct, pleased for you both but also more pleased for me and my incredible eye for chemistry, you’re welcome
Wait can anyone tell me on which videos are tht clips tht showed chris n sharla walking together and the other clip sharla n connor? I think i've watched all of chris's n sharla's videos on both channel since 2018 but i dont remember those scenes. Could it be tht tht are new clips??
All part of the zed/ colour gang
What's she think of you being ironmouse
Glad that you guys are doing well I hope for you relationship to be with Sharla goes well and finally we have a queen for the abroad in Japan empire
Garnt needs more couples to hang out with.
This explains why you and Sharla have been filming for each other, especially for this expensive Tokyo apartments.
Good going Chris!! Hope she makes you happy 😊 though, love definitely wouldn't solve my cat allergy 😂
Rather happy for you both.
Oh shit been shipping it for so long ngl
CANZUK! the only reason 😂
RIP Chronnor.
they'll break up in 2027
Sucks to be Connor
He says "it just happened". BUT I MEAN. Have you been in love with her for a long time I wonder... I apologize for speculating... but i love you guys so much🥲
Ever since I saw you two together at that market in Kanazawa, I've thought "man, these two... Someone make it happen"
Ryotaro: :(
So happy for you guys! I'm just a viewer, and I obviously don't know either of you in-person etc, but I always felt that you two must be genuinely good friends! I'm glad to know I was right. Wish you the best!!
Aww that's really cool!! Nice one Chris
You can get used to some cats i had a cat even though i have allergy.
I am allergic to cats as well and I rarely get reactions anymore. I have 3 cats and when I've been petting them a lot and immediately rub my eye for some reason that's really the only time I get a reaction (and it's just mild sneezing and watery eyes runny nose). So I'm also in the same boat of the cat allergy going away.
Dang “Sharla in Japan”. Look at Chris already giving her his last name. Brilliant!
I audibly lol'd when Chris had to explain that he's not gay. Lmao. Love this channel and you and Sharla seem like great people Chris! I wish you nothing but the best!!!
This is so CUTE
I like how Chirs lights up when he's talking about Sharla. Congratulations to the lovely couple!
if you're not gay... does that mean you're bi?
Very happy for you both!  Congratulations!
w8.. I thought Chris was dating Connor?
He's not gay? I owe someone ¥5000
I always know that ........yeah my ship won 🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🛥️🛥️ 💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
Well it was connor or sharla
I appreciate the Trash Taste Boys opening. Love that meme!
i thought charlotte was meming lol
Chris! I'm happy for you. For a minute there I was starting to think you weren't into girls! But I do understand how incredibly difficult it can be in Japan especially to find someone. But hey I wish you both the best and look forward to future content with both of you!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO congrats to you both; super happy for you guys!
Honestly I could tell they where dating but I just kept my thoughts to myself because it’s just the respectful thing to do either way super happy for you both
"YeAH IM DATING SHARLA! Let's celebrate with a plum drink!" 💕  Happy to see you both happy!
lool ...
Sharla's clock is ticking, she wants a baby!
Is there going to be a new channel "Dating in Japan" where its just you two making vids. I not opposed to it :)
I’m glad she hasn’t broken up with you not reading her messages she sent to you and that she had to pay to chat to you whilst you stream.
I sensed something since the yamadera temple video ;) This is just giving me so much joy!
Breaking News: Chris Broad is indeed not GAY.
I’ve been watching you both since the beginning of both channels. Wishing you both the very best in  your relationship 🥰❤️
Thank God the fourth Trash Taste member  isn't dating an American
BRITISH MAN FROM JAPAN WOES CANADIAN WOMAN
people say its not hair that people are allergic to its the saliva. people think its the fur cuz cats lick themselves all the time and it has their saliva in it.  but not 100% if thats true, however if the cat is bathed by sharla maybe thats why your not affected by it
Been watching Sharla for a while, seeing her happy again makes me happy.  Congratulations Sharla and Chris 😊 🎉🎉💐
Super happy for you both!! My favorite content on both your channels has honestly always been when you cross paths because you just seem so happy in each other's company~
I dont "ship" real people cuz its creepy but when i saw you guys were dating i internally screamed I FUCKING KNEW IT
Congrats on dating Sharm. You guys  have known each other for a long time.
Congratulations, Happy for you guys!
Love this; love sharla, as a Canadian, Jasper>Banff hahaha 🇨🇦
Well, I guess you are not gay lmao
“Date a friend.” That’s extremely good advice. I started dating my best friend 10 years ago and today he is the best husband I could ask for. We are still best friends even after marriage and all these years together. I wish you and Sharla all the best and a strong, wonderful relationship.
As of the cats, Those cats are somewhat hypoallergenic :D All the love to you two together <3
i am so happy for you guys
Chris should dressed up as Tuxedo Mask for the Halloween Party because Sharla dressed up as Sailor Moon.
About time you sealed the deal! I didn't think you could do it
how did I know.  I mentioned this like 4 years ago
Honestly it amazing to see you both happy. You do make a fantastic couple. Thank you for sharing this with us all, given it's a very personal part of both your lives, it's really nice to see/hear about it
next video title. Why I'm Marrying a Canadian
After all the videos you two did together, I always felt like you two just made sense, so I was just happy to see you finally did it.
The ship has sailed yeahhh
I actually thought you were dating after watching a video with you guys a while back, you did a good job of hiding it though Chris, congrats anyway fella
The funniest thing in this whole video was your impression of Pete! 😅 Nice to know the 2 of you are together and always nice to see you both smile!
You two have made content together for a while now, and I got vibes of loneliness sometimes when watching vids. Super happy you guys are together and teaming up ! I wish nothing but the best for both of you, and hope this only means more great videos in the future!
I'm glad to hear the two of you are doing well. Might be fun to see things in japan to do for couples.
Aye mr broad is back w a female.
re the cat allergy: not every cat causes allergies. It's a genetic thing tbh :)
lmao that trash taste reactions clip on her announcing she's dating Chris
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, I always loved the chemistry between u two, easily my favourite internet couple
Very nice! The both of you are really excellent content creators and I can’t help but think that together your talents will be magnified and magnificent. Here’s to many happy adventures together! Cheers Fam, here’s my coldest just for you! *cracks a frosty brew*
"he doesnt shower" had me actually rolling around laughing. god I needed that. thanks Chris XD.
You f up, the Queen will be disappointed, the English Empire is doomed.
OMG NO WAYYY!!! Congratulations to the both of you!!
Not gonna lie I'm so fucking happy for you two
I have the same cat allergy issue. It's weird how my allergies are drastically different between living with cats and not living with them.
Fully acknowledging that your private life is none of my business, I am very happy for you! Also: I love the funky headband!
Iron mouse NTR
A few weeks back I was remembering Chris talking about how it to sucks to date in Japan as an immigrant. So..... yay!
Will we see an increase love hotel videos?
2:52 Sorry what was that again? I got a bit distracted by the glowing pink headband...;P. All kidding aside, cheers!
Who wouldn't want to date a Canadian? Canadians are usually nice :)
It's funny following your videos and Sharla's separately for years and then one day you guys are just in one another's videos and now dating! I am so happy!! It bloomed from friendship too, which is wonderful. I wish more people took that approach. Dating culture sucks butts over here. Congratulations, ya bunch of cuties!
Pretty sure everyone knew the moment Sharla moved to Sendai
Best of luck hope it works out for the two of you
As soon as you guys started being the person behind the camera in the other's videos and having watched you both for as many years as I have at this point, I knew. It was as clear as day to me, I knew that SOMETHING was happening but when it really comes down to it, I don't really care because it's not my life. You guys do you and be happy. Don't change anything about how you guys are just because you're dating.   Chris, you're the reason that I came to Japan in the first place and decided to live here. I hope that you're able to make this work and that everything continues to be as great as possible because I think you deserve that and more. Focus on continuing to make your relationship work and don't let the comment section dictate how you're meant to do your videos now and when people ask where she is, ignore them. Just make yourself and her happy, that's all that I want for you and from you.
Since your video with Sharla when you said "look at the beautiful view!" while pointing the camera at her, we knew. Especially because of her reaction. 😁
If Chris can get in a relationship so can you, use this as motivation my fellow lads
Wait I thought she was being sarcastic in that video like how common it’s for people to ship youtubers together. well I got completely bamboozeld
Goodjob chris
Finally, the dynamic duo are confirmed!
This is the jtuber equivalent of finding out the math teacher and the history teacher are together
This is amazing considering I discovered Chris's channel through Sharmander on the fox island vid. Fell in love with his sense of humor and switched over. This just proves that we are living in a simulation.
Funny thing with you talking about cat allergies, the opposite happened with my older sister. We grew up with cats and my big sister ended up becoming allergic to them. Not severely allergic thank goodness, she loves cats. She had cats and just takes allergy meds
connor actually sad
About time if you ask me 😀, you two clearly had some chemistry in the journey across Japan videos.
You both gave it away when you both decided to go the u.k at the same time.
Sharla and Chris were nice enough to share this private detail of their lives with us, but the funny thing is... how is that our business? People's private life is just that... private, and it shouldn't affect or dictate their professional lives. I understand about humanizing influencers (attracts and links more viewers) and all those marketing techniques but... just saying, this is NONE of our business, and therefore should be taken as just a nice, cool gesture on behalf of Chris and Sharla. I know how difficult it is to find the right person for you, who respects your space, feelings and everything else. So on my behalf I would like to say: I wish you guys the best! Both individually and as a couple!
Good for you two!
I started watching your channel during the pandemic and you got me through lockdown. Happy for you man!
YES YES YES 🙌🙌🙌🙌 from the bottom of my heart I am genuinely happy for you guys ❤️❤️❤️ this is the ship we've all been waiting for!!! I was having a very bad day but i swear to god this video put the biggest smile on my face ❤️💗 i wish you guys all the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chris why is there an airbus throttle quadrant to your left?
aaah I'm so happy to hear! I've always thought you were just incredible together!
9% plum drink wasn't the best choice here. I'm just saying.
Trash taste boys are the most amazing hype men ever haha. This was the most wholesome and adorable news when I heard it. Congrats Sharla and Chris!
Your cat allergy was cured through the power of love (◡ ‿ ◡ ✿)
Im so surprised, i legit thought she was joking when she said it. Congrats tho!!
I knew something was up when you said you liked the vegan burger
so these two have been dating for like 3 years? Wow! Awesome!
Congratz to you both! :)
Congratulations.   Blessing to the both of you.
LETS GOOOO
Never thought I'd see the day where that reaction without proper context meme got used on an official video about it.  Anyway, good luck to you both! Hope the relationship keeps going well, and maybe even gets any... further. Also RIP Connor /s  PS: Congratulations on potentially terminating your cat allergy! Maybe now you'll be able to retry the cat documentary- just kidding of course on the last part, t'is up to you afterall.
I always thought you two would date one day.
Meat is healthy, just not when it’s fried or oily … grilled is best
Wow she could truly become A Broad in Japan.
So, Now that your dating a Canadian can we assume you would agree that Canadian girls are some of the most beautiful around?
🥳🥳🥳 congratulation
Oh my glob, when I first watched Sharla's video, I thought she was being sarcastic. I thought she just said it to humour and appease some commenters. I'm sorry, I've wired myself to always treat everything with the slightest grain of salt. But I'm genuinely happy for the both of y'all. Thank you for clarifying it all. I feel like I'm watching an episode of Friends for some reason HAHAHA! I've been watching your entire gang's individual Youtube channels for so long.
I've been expecting this at some point since the Shimanami Kaido video. When you said it was the best view you've seen and showed Sharla right afterwards did I go "Maaaaan that's smoooooth." Yes. Yes, I did.
Commonwealth Love 2022 Tokyo
It’s nice that the two of you are together. When you visit Canada don’t go to Banff it’s very commercialized, go to Jasper which isn’t.
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
Hey canadians are awesome. Given i am one as well and i am great LOL
I had a feeling when you both took a trip to the UK at the same time
Ever since i first saw you two together i knew it would work.
I thought you were high risk for MonkeyPox all this time. Thank goodness!
I knew it!
Expected this for some reason. Both intelligent level headed people despite Chris doing his best not to appear so :P Best of luck to both of you! I wish you happiness and joy :)
I can only sincerely apologise for making a meme that has made thousands of people think you’re gay, sorry Chris x
Cat Nation 2 baby!!!
You look happy 😊 I'm very happy for both of you! You've always had a great chemistry!!! And you make a great couple, you really do look great together <3
Lol the first time I ever saw Sharla was her appearance on Journey Across Japan. As I watched the episode my thoughts turned to, “Aw, I think he likes her! 🥰”
LET'SSS GOOOO!!!!!!!
did your friends really not know you were dating her for a while? or were they just happy that you finally announced it to the public?
ngl i really thought it was a joke. im still not 100% sure its not a very elaborate  joke
Hi
A video that makes me smile. Good to know what not only he found a good relationship that he's very comfortable with, but that it's helping him even get healthier. All the best Chris.
My brain immediately was like "oh wow, that's a bit of an age gap" but then I realized Sharla is actually a little older... Chris just looks 10 years older than he is smh
"Why I'm dating a Canadian" I mean, what else would you do in Japan?
Obvious alliance to re-take the American continent.   We have you figured out
Ah, I always love seeing you guys together because you have such great synergy. I guess this just makes sense. Wish you all the best!
2:25 ayo! why you doing my boi dirty like that!? 😆😆😆
Haha, and I thought l it would already happend since you two rode across Japan.
It’s amazing she ever forgave you for that roller coaster incident back in the day. Happy for both of ya. You’ve always seemed like a great pair. Best to both of you!
Connor and Chris take weekend trips together regularly, they were kicked out of love hotels because those love hotels did not accept gay couples, and Chris knows how much Connor showers. Can't fool my gaydar.
I foresee one or two plot twists. The announcement was a last ditch attempt to save their relationship and it'll all be over this week or it's really a cover for Chris being gay.  Assuming I'm wrong, congrats you  deserve it
I saw you guys prowling each other's channels' comment sections, and now it makes sense.
Awww this makes me so so happy <3 it's funny because I found Sharla through Taylor R and I found you through Joey, so when I found out you and Sharla were friends I was like EEYYY! Glad you guys are happy <3
It's the love in the air that cured your allergies
I got an advert for Bumble on this video. I usually hate YouTube adverts but that one on this video was just brilliant.
Nice. I always thought you guys gave off that vibe anyways even if you weren't dating at the time, but nice.
Thought you were going trans. Hahah.
Its lovely, but... well... you are grown people... why not? Congrats never the less.
wait i tought you had a japanese wife. wife the whole thing.
dang not even a mention of garnt xD
"So how did you two get to know each other?" Chris: "I found this Canadian girl on YouTube with a million views eating bread in Japan"
For weight loss, I find that cutting out carbs (rice, noodles, pasta etc) after 3pm helps a lot. Unless you cycle 200km a day or do heavy labour, carbs aren't really necessary. Takes a while to get used to, but it worked for me. 96kg to 88kg (6ft).   Ganbatte for your weight loss journey, looking forward to Adonis in Japan!
I am so happy for both of you
Finally 🤣🤣🤣
Also, the whole Connor thing.  While there's probably a few people that took it seriously, I think the whole "poor Connor thing" was from that video where you joked that you went to a burger place with your "boyfriend CdawgVA"
Thanks for the relationship advice Chris! Next, could you give some advice for making friends?  Jokes aside, congratulations! Wishing both of you a long lasting relationship!
I had thought sharla would go for someone like Ryotoro more...but hey its cool...
I'm sad for the Connor/Chris....JK congratulations!!!!
Why did the video from last stream went to "Private"? I was watching it by parts.. and now I can not finish it :-/
Pretty sure the saliva from a cat is what causes the allergic reaction not their fur, so when they clean themselves you touch their spit along with their fur
To keep the commonwealth alive, one must stay within the Empire... I mean commonwealth...
As they say in my wife's motherland, MOZEL TOV!
This entire time I genuinely thought she was married to a Japanese man. Super happy for you!
To be honest very happy for you but part of me still thinks that you two are just playing everyone for craps and giggles, congrats to you both
WHY IS AN APPLE IN A PLASTIC BAG !!??
Asian girls are more fun Chris This is a big mistake,this like sending coals to Newcastle sort of thing
Worst kept secret 2022.
I think they know you are not dating Connor. They just love to troll you 😂
That's very strange with your cat allergy, for me it's the opposite. I grew up with cats, but I've developed an allergy to them in recent years for some reason.
What?! No way! I thought it was you and Connor after all those love hotel videos... 😭 Just kidding! Wish the best for you two! 😀  Edit: I love that plum drink that you're drinking on this vid!
noice
I am married to one.  Good on ya mate 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Congrats! :)
Good, somebody to keep Chris sane and on the right path.
oh that was serious, i thought it was just banter, anyway congrats then
when Chris said he dressed up as the candyman my first thought went to the horror movie character 😂... so happy for you and sharla!
For the life of me I can't recall if I originally found your vids through Sharla's channel or the other way around. But I have been subscribed to both of you for a long time now and when Sharla revealed you guys were dating I screamed with joy! Each of you have your own style of filming and editing, but both are as equally fun, entertaining and yes, also educational. Lots of love for the two of you and can't wait to see the new Journey across Japan on 14th of August.
Thanks for your relationship advice
5:31 as soon as he said "picturesque", I immediately knew he meant Banff... Chris, if you ever see this, Lake Louise is a must-see 🤩
most important question is was your first date at McDonalds?
Congratz to you both, all the happiness in the world to you. Looking forward to your upcoming Journey Across Japan.
Congrats Chris although i saw it coming
Congratulations 💐
Congrats again! 🥳 I’m so happy for you both, you make an adorable couple! 🤗
I've been watching you both for years and I've always seen a hint of flirting between you too. Thought you'd be cute together. Good luck.
I wonder what Ryotaro’s role is going to be at that wedding. If Natsuki is best man and Connor and Joey are responsible for the coats… Maybe Ryotaro will be the skeleton in the closet of the bridal suite?
Wow, Sharla's place does look really nice!
I wish you guys the best!
Looks like I dont have a chance for Chris now 😭 ( jk) 😅
@Chris Abroard Congratulations 🎊 yo the nothing of you all upu need now is Free Canadian Maple Syrup 🍁
I totally get not making a huge announcement right away. There’s a lot of wisdom in that. Like you said, something could happen a few months in.  PS: I don’t think you give off gay vibes. 😉
Wow,  have been cheering for the two of you to get together since the Journey Across Japan videos! Congrats you two. This is so awesome!
Congratulations! your both Awesome!
Your allergy to cats will go away with time… As the toxmoplasma gondii sets In and takes over your brain lol.
The cringe people who actually thought Conor and Chris were datating ant didn’t realize it was a meme and are loosing their minds over it need to touch grass
Chris, I have good news.  Esting healthier is not eating less meat. Rather, it's simply cutting out processed sugars like sweets, alcohol, and bread.  Exercise is also 15% of weight loss, but that doesnt mean you can slack off on it. Remember to eat veggies before every meal, and sleep lots.
Bet you introduced Sharla to your folks when you were back in Blighty!?!? I thought that Sharla was giving you the “I quite fancy him” look months ago! 😊 Made up for you both!!  Romantic weekends across Japans best spots for couples.
I am glad to hear it. Been following both of your channels for a long time. My wife and I are both happy for you, but we had our suspicions about the two of you.
Really happy for you two !! also I love the outro
She's friggin gorgeous I always figured you two would date at some point
why Natsuki is smoking in the outro clip? he wanted to quit, right?
😂😂
I said POG out loud in the beginning of this video, what's wrong with me lmao. Happy for you guys!
💕
this is easily the best news i've been wanting to hear. sharla and chris an item. can't think of any other better news than that. i am still so happy. congrats once again! cheers 😁
So happy for you because Sharla is from My home town so Id love to see a Video in Canada cheers
😕 All these years I've tried to convince myself that they are just platonic friends a to not ship ppl. Now it just feels weird and icky thinking that Chris and Sharla...
Your PremierTwo impression is the real story.
Unless you have digestive problems meat is actually pretty good for you (excluding the heme iron in red meat in excessive amounts) It's FRIED FOOD that's the problem, if you stopped eating fried chicken but just ate the same calories in french fries it'd be worse because at least chicken has some nutrients, the oil they fry food in is really bad for you
I thought chris was dating cdawg?🤣🤣
Thought you guys were dating like forever ago, lol.
Always felt that the both of you complete each other 👍😊 What a beautiful couple! All the best and please take good care of Sharla (and Maro and Tuna) ! 🌸
But aren't you just Ironmouse in a Mech suit?
Don't come to Canada anytime soon. As long as Trudeau Castro is in power, this place is going to hell.....
Can't wait to see you in Canada then!
2:24 connor definitely not sobbing in his room from hearing this. jokes aside YAY so happy for you chris and shar!!!
I was hoping you guys would get together ❤  so happy for you both!!
Rip Connor….
Why are you dating Sharla in Japan and not in... Canada?  Congratulations on your relationship! I always thought you'd make a nice couple since I saw you together on those Journey Across Japan videos.
I was 100% sure this was clickbait!! Ha! I've had my suspicions for years 😁 Happy for you both! 🥰
I already watched the stream this was in, but again, congrats to you two. You're both my kinda people, though oddly enough, not in the same ways. Sharla because she reminds me of my own friends and family back in Canada, and you because you remind me of a very sarcastic but articulate and fun Brit I used to work for and always look back on fondly.
I can't believe you used that video at the beginning 😂 I was wondering if you had seen it, and now I have my answer.
So great to see you both so happy. Glad you adapted to Maro as I wouldn’t fancy your chances if Sharla had to choose between you and the cats 😂😂😂
I've been assuming that for at least 7 months. When you kept going on Romantic retreats up in fall coved mountains. BTW, what happen to your video catalog, half your videos disappeared.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
I think it's Wonderful! I wish you both all the happiness. 🌠 I knew when you did the Burger King video that there was something. 💕
Your headband is amazing. Not as amazing as Sharla, of course. But still really good.
So happy for both of you! Here's to a long long long and happy relationship!
So much love for you both 🥰🥰
it was very very obvious, I'm glad you both decided to come forward and very happy for you both :)
"Connor doesn't shower" Every Wacky Weekend video: shows Connor in a bath. Technically, the truth
Not gonna lie, I legit thought she was joking.
AHHHHHH MY SHIP CAME TRUE
Welp, time to go through every video with the two of them together and microanalyze every single interaction for a hint of foreshadowing
So happy for you!! The secrecy makes a lot of sense. Sharla gets the most heinous gossipy comments talking about her love life
im happy u didnt go public, defo think its the right way to keep it a bit hidden due to the reasons u mentioned. hope u get happy days, and if it means we see both of u in vids more often then thats only a bonus :D  best of luck and best of wishes hope u have a bunch of fun together :D
Too cute :) I wish you both nothing but happiness!
I love Mouse screaming in that clip lol. Her voice cuts through and makes it. Congrats to you and Sharla. Happy for you guys.
So she put her foot down really hard this time, no escape.
Wishing you all the joy! Keep what you will to yourselves but I am happy to know you and Sharla are happy!
The reason her cats don't affect your allergy is because of the power of love.
Congrats Chris! This came out of nowhere lmao wish you both good tidings!🫶🏿🫶🏿
If Chris can find love then there is hope for everyone
How could you betray Connor like this Chris.
Go on Chris Lad
It's sweet to see young love, stay honest and if it doesn't work out then make sure you end it on good terms, as that's a positive thing too. Wise to stay gently private.  You obviously not gay though, the dancing skills and prohibitive hygiene standards are lacking.
Garnt's just ...came
I called this months ago when you guys were in each other's videos, I felt like I could see some chemistry.
Woo! I was really hoping this was true! I don't know why I'm so excited that two people I don't personally know, are dating. It still feels like two friends getting together that you thought would get along and make a good couple. Congrats to y'all and my condolences to Connor. 😁
This recent news does mean that her move to Sendai makes a lot more sense. 🙂
Dating a fucking leaf.
Congratulations🥳🥳🥳🥳 Wishing you both a wonderfully long and happy relationship ❤ ❤❤❤
I've been married to a Canadian for nearly 20 years and can confirm; no special privileges. You may be expected to celebrate Canada Day (you have plenty of time to look that one up), and maple syrup on bacon....oh.... British bacon is different from Canadian bacon.  Oh hell. Well, sure you'll figure it all out.  Good luck.
It was only a matter of time...congrats to you both!!
I've enjoyed you are Sharla's camraderie and banter over the years. Friendship is the best start to a romantic relationship. Best wishes to you both <3
Exposure therapy can work in some cases of people having cat allergies
So happy for you two!!!!
Aww that's great I'm happy for you Chris! I hope you two have a nice and long happy relationship.^^
Your American Pete impression is scarely accurate ngl
So after all these years your just gonna turn ya back on me...no kiss goodbye...nothing. smh x
The whole community: I'm shocked! Shocked I tell you! well not that shocked
I appreciate you holding back for Connor's sake. But JK, congratulations!
What's your celebrity ship name? "Sharlris"? SHARLRIS!  And it looks like it's true what they say... there's no greater way to catch feelings for someone than to hunt Pokemon decorated manhole covers with them. 😄 Mazel tov! 😊
Normally I’m a bit meh about peoples relationships on YouTube, this is probably the only one I cheered 🥲
The real reason why Chris has been getting into shape lately ;) but this is fantastic to hear!
That intro tho! XD hope you two are really happy together! :D
I've watched your videos for years hoping you would find a great companion and you found the best one!!
I went to university in Canada.  Canadians are great!
This is like when ryan higa started dating ms chey, I felt the same happiness!
best fucking news of the year
Sharla is absolutely beautiful inside and out ... be happy always! ❤️
As an American, we just assume all British people are gay. It's the accent. Only when you do an impression of Pete did I realize you're not. Congrats to you both!
Friends or romance, it was always nice to see Sharla laugh and smile so much in any video you two were in together. This really is quite sweet, I'm so happy.
Yeah your allergies changes every 6 months. So it’s best to get tested if you are wondering if your level of allergies. Also, it depends on the type of cat too. I know a steamer that is allergic to cats by for some reason this one cat they aren’t. As I said it just depends of the breed your your health.
You got lucky Chris! Congratulations to you both.💕
omg finally. wtf took you guys so long lol
"Date a friend" 💯
Dating a Canadian means you’re now automatically an ice hockey fan! Go Canucks ! 🏒🇨🇦🥰
Huh! I always thought Sharla was mildly annoyed by Chris. I guess it's one more data point showing that whatever viewers assume about creators is probably totally wrong. 🤷‍♀  But then again... you *can* love someone and *still* be mildly annoyed by them.. 🤔 I kid, I kid. Really happy for you both 😊
Awesome job chris and congratulations for you to
I love your pete impression
Not gonna lie, I thought Sharla was joking and everyone else was playing into it
I thought your cat allergy was subliminal because you preferred hot dog
The Bromance was so strong that people actually thought you were gay 😂
I'm over the moon for you guys!! Congrats!!
My brother is allegedly deadly allergic to cats, He is also a cat lady...
Connor's reaction is GOLD 😂
mans winning in life rn fr
*lights up an oversized cigar*  Hell, It's about damn time.
Sharla, the world needs to know: is Chris a briefs, a boxer-shorts, or a commando kind of guy?
Chris you don't need to cut down on meat to eat a healthy diet, just eat lean cuts of meat with veggie sides. I hope everything goes well with both of you. Stay safe
Sharla and you make a great couple. Congratulations.
With gas prices in Montreal these days, you'll want to save money however you can haha!🤣🤣
So happy for both you. Take it one day at a time!
just hearing chris chat about sharla and dating brings a giant smile to my face i am SO HAPPY FOR YALL AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I am SO happy for you both! You are both amazing people and I wish you both every happiness with no pressure or cat allergies 💕
This is probably a big sham to hide the fact Connor is your boyfriend 🤣
Don't cut out meat. Cut out carbs: bread, pizza, potato.
chris, be honest, you always had a crush on sharla, right? 🐈
Natsuki having his place secured as a best man is precious
Who would have thought that homemade sake cup you made for Sharla, would have won her heart.  Note to self: when you like someone, make them a homemade sake cup and give it to them.
It's funny you can also hear Chris screaming yes on Connor reaction video.
SO HAPPY FOR U
My husband is allergic to cats. But we own two. You can usually build up a tolerance to 1-2 cats. My husband can’t handle anymore than 2, but we have had ours for 5 years and most days he forgets he allergic.
They be reacting like their favorite anime just got a new season and its gonna be animated by a well reputable studio and im all here for it. Also congrats 🎉👏
…cause Canadians are awesome? 🇨🇦👍
Very affable.
Can I just say that Chris knows how to title a video 😂 I wish you guys all the best!! 🥰
Dating a Canadian, no real advantage beyond getting to be with a Canadian... and legal weed. Marry a Canadian and you get automatic permanent residency status plus an easier time getting citizenship.
The elation from the guys is so genuine and sweet! You two will make a lovely couple!
I’m so happy for the two of you! You make such a perfect couple and it’s clear how happy you make each other. Wishing you lots of love! ❤️
You both are driven successfull people.  You both have common interests and separate things to keep busy with. Great base to start a relationship on.
good to know thats you did find some pills that work, now at least you can get away with stroking the pussy, with having a bad reaction....always helpful! :)
I’m so happy for the two of you! You make such a perfect couple and it’s clear how happy you make each other. Wishing you lots of love! ❤️
WARNING! NO NEW CONTENT. This is just a section from the live stream.
Snagged a Canadian, good work Chris!
You are dating a Canadian because we rock!!
I'm so happy for you. All the best.
Fun
Chris has Cat brain worms, confirmed
"Me and roger are Daving" hmmm
I always thought you two would have made a good couple
Happy for you guys! Glad you both are in a point happy to discuss the relationship in public. Wish you all the best
So happy for you ❤❤
so happy for both of you
A relationship for fiscal and economic reasons
Why you are dating a Canadian? 'Cause she's a great gal!
yeah its not like it wasnt obvious ages ago lol
From a Canadian, don't live here unless you want to drive everywhere and walk nowhere
Connor crying inside
I'm here for the CDawgVA slander
gg Chris, sucks to be Connor
RIP Tokyo Lens haha
I'm so happy for you Chris! Cheers! 🥂
Congrats chrissss best wishesss 🌻🌻🥰🥰
Now why is the full stream private now?
I still can't tell if the reactions are real or fake. Where is the original reaction video 😂
So...you're making vlogs in Japan and about the Japanese culture and now after all this time, you're dating a Canadian as a British guy. Interesting.
Glad to hear you’re happy Mr. Affable. Can’t wait for the new season !
It must be rough to keep it a secret for so long .The internet will want to pry into every little detail of your personal life
Wait a second is this for real????? I thought it was joke 💀💀💀💀💀
I knew this was gonna happen when I watched the jaj cycle
We’ve known for quite some time Chris. Sharla was the only other thing that could make you smile as much as fried chicken ;)
So, are you going to take down the sexy card girls near the telephone?
Yay! I’m so happy for you both. 😃
Lucky bastard, she's a beauty. 👍
You get used to cats if you're allergic over time, you really do! nearly had to put myself in a big bubble and roll around like a big sniffly weirdo when I got mine
So happy for you two! :3
Poor Ryotaro is not even on the short list for best man...
So Happy for yall. Always thought you 2 had a Relationship. Best Wishes to you Both
Chris exposed Connor's shower schedule. What a betrayal.
i didn’t know connor was canadian! ❤️
I picked up on some chemistry way back when you did the first Journey Across Japan on the bike, so I always suspected.
Even Chris's alter ego, Ironmouse, started celebrating.
Woah the news we've been waiting for 😁😁
It all makes sense now, Sharla was your only guest in your studio who didn't eat plastic food!!
I’m so happy for you two. Honestly you guys are perfect for each other. She seems so nice.
Amazing Pete impersonation  10/10 would listen to again.
As my cockney dad would say "Gowon my Son!"
I have seen that clip, and i thought it just a joke. But Anyway congratulations 🎉
Somehow it feels like you both werec the last to know 😅
Hooray!
they though you where having bromance.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Good to see and congrats to you two. Plus, totally get why you guys didn't share for a while. 1. It's personal business. Some stuff needs to stay that way. 2. Like you said, you don't want to share too early. Just opens up for awkwardness if it ends sooner. Yet, wish you two the best!
Finally! Chris looked so in love when cycling the long bridge with sharla in the first JAJ-season. Remember when he talked about seeing those "Bread Girl" videos by Sharla before moving to Japan. And they're finally together. What a fairytale:-)
you look pretty gay in that neon head band.....
We all thought it was going to be Connor.
I must admit I didn't have a clue but my wife did. Watched one video and said 'nice couple them two.'  Didn't believe her😅
"I would never date Conner, he doesn't shower."  Oh. Oh. Oh no. _I can't support him anymore._
Banff is gorgeous in the summer and the winter so take time one day to experience both. The drive from Vancouver is beautiful 😍
You're punching Chris ❤️
Chris grow your goatee again, it looked badass
Not going to make Ryotaro best man?
Was anyone else in any doubt?! I guessed ages ago! Congratulations though
Congratulations Chris and Sharla! You two look happy together. I wish you the best
Chris's impression of pete is spot on lmao
well done mate i thought u would die alone but u proved us wrong
TOOK SO LONG!!!! MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT! I TOLD YOU!!
Montrealer, here.  Once had a colleague by the last name of "Broad".  Only one I've ever bumped into.  I wonder... 🤔
Now I know why he was riding behind her during that biking across japan
Chris Broad getting a girlfriend compelled Gigguk to believe in a god. XD
I always knew the both of ya are meant to be together.   edit: I also realise that i sound like a granny 👵
I always felt that there was some energy there. Sorry, you’ll have to give up meat. ;)
congrats chris!! you two seem so sweet on camera, happy for you guys and sending you both love <3 <3 <3
Lmao 🤣 they thought you were gay ahaha
Me, who shipped you two from the beginning: G o d    e x i s t s
Congratulations 👍
Just want to go out and sqy this again, from the moment i saw you two on screen I thought this should happen, and when she got divorced i secretly hoped for this. Good for both of you
Very happy for you two, good for you
I mean you say your not gay but that headband is definitely bi-curious
Don't worry, Connor still has Ironmouse.
Queerbaiting In Japan season has ended D:
OH CANADA MY HOME AND NATIVE LAND TRUE PARTRIOT LOVE IS CONQUERING CHIRS'S PANTS 😤🇨🇦 WITH GLOWING HEART WE SEE THE RISE OF AN ERECTION ON OUR SEA FROM A UNION JACK OH CANDA WE STAND ON GARD FOR THEE. OH and God save the queen
yeee boiiii  u guys have great on screen chemistry  we are rooting for u guys 👌👌👌👌💪
Cheers Mate🍻
I feel sorry for Connor
I'd like to imagine Chris addresses Sharla as "Sharla in Japan" even when they chat casually lol
I'm allergic to cats. You can totally get acclimated to individual cats. I've lived with them my whole life, but I don't react to my own casts at all. I react to the cats of friends and relatives, but still less so than cats I have never been around.
We've all known this would happen since 2018 when Sharla pointed to a map and asked Chris if they could visit Saiko Bat Cave. That was the moment Chris fell for the Canadian.
So you're saying Connor is single?
I'm glad that you put hygiene before orientation. It is an important priority!
I can’t believe you’re cheating on Connor with a Canadian of all people.
I too, thought you were dating Connor. Lol also, if we don’t know who you’re dating, how can we know your sexuality? But that relationship is still very sweet and I’m glad you can be close to your guy friends and jokes around with them like that. It’s a really special thing to have. You’ve got a great bunch of people around you. I love feeling like a tiny part of your lives.
Nice
Maybe your just used to the allergies...I don't think allergies just "go away"??
I'm glad for you both, you two are so lovely together.
So happy for you and Sharla! Would you ever tell us how long you’ve been dating? My guess is a little over a year, if not more.
I know your eyes Chris when look sharla. All your video YouTube with sharla. You always smile n happy
Is Sharla trying to make you  give up meat?
Dating a Canadian isn't so bad.  There are a few ones.  But Sharla is a VEGGIESAURUS!  She doesn't even think about eating other animals!  Sher's gonna be healthy!  You won't be able to run through Sendai biting things!
i love broadmeleon. pls kiss
Congrats to you both! Hope your new partner will take you to better places than your last Welsh partner 😂
I'm really happy for you man. The grumpy fatass got the pretty wholesome girl! XD I hope things work out for you two forever ❤️
Since you said you've been together quite a while, were there any close calls with fans? Did anyone witness you being suspiciously un-mean to Sharla in public and you had to blackmail them to keep their mouth zipped?
For the green card of course
The affable couple
It's because Canadians are awesome (coming from a Canadian). 🇨🇦
The only thing that matters is if the two of you folks are happy; and the two of you clearly are.
Is it because Canadians are awesome?
3:35 People can get over allergies so Maybe you just got over it.
From watching some girl eating bread on YouTube to dating her... who'd have guessed!?
I still think Chris is gay idc
I also have a Canadian girlfriend, they are fantastic!
She is such a sweet girl! Very happy for both of you!
I knew it months ago!!! So happy for you both <3
WTF is wrong with this guy, all that Japanese snatch for the eating and he dates a white girl.  Yellow fever baby!
Yeah when Roger and David broke up it really puts me off caring about YouTuber life
grats bro
Talk about punching above your weight. Well done
I'm so happy you guys are together!!!!! Wishing all the best for you two! 🤍
2:25 so if Connor were to take a shower, would that give him a second chance? 🤔
You guys are so cute!! See everyone loves you guys together!!
EARLY! Bro I actually shipped them since the very first Journey across Japan. So happy for you Chris!
I had cat allergies and after a couple of weeks of my GF moving in with her cat, I'm now 200% allergies free. There is hope!
Could be worse. She could be American.  I kid. I kid. You're a great couple!
The number of people who think the reaction parodies are real, or that sharla is being sarcastic, or that you're dating connor, is baffling but hilarious.
Inb4 this is all an elaborate ruse and they've collaborated to boost each others stats  Jk I'm happy for you both :)
cute!
Congrats! I've been watching both of you guys since the beginning of both of your channels, I grew up watching your videos. I'm so happy for you both and I wish you many years of happiness! You both inspired me to move to Japan too! I've been here over 4 years now
“WOOOOOO YEAH BABY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT” -MoistCritikal
I've always shipped you two soooooo... not a surprise :)
So so happy for you both :3
I heard dating a Canadian comes with a lifetime supply of maple syrup.
I haven't been able to keep up with your vids the last months, but nevertheless I wanted to jump in and congratulate you both 😌
I've been waiting for this day since the very first video she was introduced. Knew this would eventually happen. Cheers mate! 🍻
Could always tell, she always seemed so charmed by you, and more happy than usual in all of your videos together. So glad this is real haha, Congrats Crhis, Sharla seems amazing
やっぱり＝＝！シャーラさんを見るクリスの視線が他とは違ってすごく優しいと最近思っていた！！ お似合いです～～～
A Canadian!?!? A colonial?!?!?! The scandal!!!
Finally! The good news we're all looking for!! Congrats! Ofc Chris needs the Ying (light) in his life. Dark and dry Bri'ish humor jokes gonna need support from Canadian light jokes xD
I felt the chemistry when you guys in matsushima video with natsuki 10 months ago.
We all knew this months ago. Good job, Chrissy.
Sharla in Japan amd Abroad in Japan have the same last name. How can they date??
Congratulations Chris! You two always had a similar vibe and I was wondering why weren't you dating for all these years she has been in your videos?
I'm so happy for the two of you!!
Ya love to see it. Best wishes to both of you!
hehe only shows that women meet you at the end of the road....I'm glad for Chris,mans moved to Japan for this girl but I wonder how things would've been if he didn't became successful and kinda rich....I don't wonder actually I know.
The Sharla-Chris Shippers finally won!!!
Nice. Happy you guys are happy together. Looking forward for more collabs :)
Great for you Chris! one question, Will you still cover yourself in custard and drive across japan with one eye? (the right one)
Incredible news
Awww I absolutely love this!!! Chris and Sharla together make so much sense :) <3
Those three cheering when she said it is so cute
My fav two Youtuber dating with each other. I believe you'll keep it private which is a good thing for a relationship. Please keep private and enjoy ur time together. Love u guys.. Best wishes.
I’m going on 8 weeks with my cat when does the allergies for the cat stop lol she can’t lick me either or she makes my mouth itch bad

Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaay.....whooooooo😀😀😀🥰
So this is now a content, eh?
Love tames cat allergies.
Broad’s broad
Have you spanked
Way to go
Question is - why is Sharla dating Chris?!?  😉
I don’t think you have to explain. I’d date a Canadian in a heartbeat, if only I didn’t live in God-forsaken Texas.
Poor old Connor 😢 Have you and Sharla considered adopting Connor ? ☺
Congratulations to you both 🤯😍!
TELL US ALL about the COLLAB with PEWDIEPIE!!!! Thats the real surprise news!
They made a video together 8th months ago how did no one believe it
I still dont know why CDawgVA is happy for losing bf...
we all know this is a set up so that chris can be with his true lover connor
Took you a long time mate
Didn’t have to do Connor like that 😬
the abroad in japan lore has progressed..
I think there's something nefarious going on, Chris. I heard she's been spotted with Dave in Japan.
I want to know what is your first video where you are dating even though you hadn't told anyone?
Tbh it's a good question cosindering there's so many pretty girls in Japan ;)
Stans gonna be out today saying "i kNeW iT!!1!!"
congrations you done it
Iam so happy both of you been couple for long time
what happened to the live stream? I was like 75% done with it and I was about to watch the rest of it with my breakfast this morning but ...... it doesn't exist anymore
I Think You Both Are Great People and I'm so Happy for You Both!
Congratulations, Chris! Best wishes to you both 🎉 Much love from Orlando!

0:13 Bro their reactions are so supportive XD
I think it was the rollercoaster that Chris Broad made Sharla go on that did it! LOL!
Awww! Your smile when watching the guys react to Sharla's announcement 💜 Cute!
This couldn't have been more obvious lol
I thought this was all a joke LoL
Punching fella hahahha
Congrats mate! Sad for Cdawg but it is what it is LOL
I knew it bruh
Connor doesn’t shower. He only lounges in baths on wacky weekends
Literally the only time I've been excited for anyone two people to announce they're a couple. Is this what Facebook mums feel about all this kardashian, Bradulina (dated example but I'm old and don't care) wank?
Awhhhh! Happy for you two ^^
You're the Chad !

NOTIFICATION SQUAD: You may have already seen or heard about this in Sharla's video or various reaction parodies, but I thought I should talk about it myself! I don't want a lot of surprised viewers later on down who missed the previous announcement! And a big thank you to everyone for the kind words 🍻
