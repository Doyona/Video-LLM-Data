9:44 maybe they just got paid on Saturday...
Panic buy united 😂
Man u are a shambles what has happened to the club.
Goldbridge just forgot about the 2020-21 season with bruno
Utd think they have a coup 😂 real madrid laughing think someone paid 60 million for 30 year old and 350k wages u just been laughed at again 😂

Zlatan was one of the good signings made post Fergie
Imagine signing CASEMIRO 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆before de jong ⚽️
This is nothing to do with utds owners. But you have to blame someone.  Look at your players. Please please keel mcquire ever match, then I suppose  its the  FA s fault
Surely thats the end off scott and fred both playing each week
varane: flop sancho: flop casemiro: flop ten hag: flop
SARR is option 04. GLAZERS OUT!  za
'Glazers out', wah fuckin wah... lol
Casemiro will look good for 6 months. He won't be interested after the world cup.
Mark you cant get your knickers in a twist when people have an opinion or something to say that you dont like or understand. You really dont nees to entertain or mention anything they say but i do believe these show are for debates on everything football.
I think we are on the right track to the championship! We have the right captain to lead us! Remember Leeds? players leaving and bad ownership? Just recently look at Schalke! What is happening at united? Pogba Matic Mata leaving sponsors want to go out bad ownership.. I just hope this can turn around!
Daddy Glazer went and bought you Casemiro and you’re pretending to still be angry with them LOL
Imagine casemiero having to listen to our useless captain maguire who hasn't won anything.  A 5 time champions league winner having to listen to this fool it astonishes me
Loan out Maguire instead of Eric Bailly ☹️use some sense
Plot twist - RM are screwing with us, after the broken fax fiasco... they will lead us on and pull out last min 🤣🤣
£70million for a 30 year old! Terrible signing!
Glazers out now
carrasco please come Rashford wont taste starting line-up
Only thing that matters is getting the glazers out!
This is such a disgusting move. Lose all respect for Casemiro.
Get out! 🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰
Carragher impression 😂👌
Asensio would be a good signing
Surley he's only coming for a massive wage. He knows united might no play champions league football ever potentially at united.
We need to sell Donny back to Ajax as he's not premier league standard (I wish he was though), McTominnay to Everton, Bailey to Roma, Jones to a mid Championship side, Chong to a dutch side (he'd be a useful signing if the fee wasn't high)  Bring in De Jong or Savic + Casemiro & Sangare & Dest or Dumfries & Leroy Sane or Jonathan David
Glazers out. Enough said.
The Glazer era has to end ASAP. They have dragged our beloved club to the edge of an abyss, made us a laughing stock, allowed ludicrous contract clauses for players allowing them game time regardless of current form, and interfered too many times with the management of the team. They are totally inept and need to be shown the door.
What will draw sir Jim in is that fact that is United fans will litterally workship him if he buys the club if the glazers and he will go down as an absolute icon in our eyes
What’s the obsession with a rebuild when ETH is expected to build with all the players that have put us in this situation. Rashford, Maguire, Mctominay, Shaw etc. The fanbase needs to accept that we are not being built to compete on the field.
Casimero is a quality player that will add a lot to this United midfield. And we will finish higher in the Premier League table than we would have done if we dont sign him. But this is a desperate move from the Glazers to hold onto power. Thats what the British monarchy did when the saw what happened in France with the French revolution. Give them some bread when they are starving to stop them revolting!.
I'm from Pakistan living in Dubai, I'd pay for a proper campaign to DUMP the glazers.. Glazers Out!
I simply love how u speaks truth from long time.
💯 percent with goldbrige don’t matter who they sign the can still piss of
Is this another terms and conditions agreed like the Barcelona chap 🤔
Glazers out
McMiro incoming....
Why 60 million for casminro is old this club is going no where we could have got neves for that much and is young to. Retirement home fc and Bailey out on loan when man u could get rid of Harry shity maguire Instead
Casemiro should come in and body Maguire.
I think we need to remember we can still support the team, still cheer new players coming in, still full support the manger while at the same time doing all we can to get the Glazers out. It is not a choice of either one or the other.
if Man United hammer Liverpool i can’t wait for this guys reaction 😂😂😂😂
Why don’t you want carasco? He is actually good, he’s fast, works hard good stamina, good technique, creates and scores?
Should have kept pogba Soo 😂😂😂 with casameiro
Utd should give Garner a chance and rotate him with Casemiro...and sell Mc Tominay
What’s the long term plan? What’s the short term plan? What’s the f’in plan?
Don't let this blind sight u GLAZERS OUT!!!!!
Is good to have champions at every department of the game but we have to sign younger talented players to blend
We need another midfielder and we need to get rid of Mac tomminay he is the new Fellani he is crap every manager loves him and sombody just has to pull the trigger and say get replace him with Garner.
How can Ronaldo possibly be a green signing yet Bruno is amber?
Wish pogba could play with cas
It looks like the Glazers dont want to leave, do hope they will though. Its probably all up to the fans now to Unite to push them out. Will be a small but important step  but then the bog work starts. The whole club needs cleaning out top to bottom.
Where do you get it's rubbish from. I am sure you are a nice bloke, however do you ever get your predictions correct. No new signings, that's a fact.
Its all crap he won't be coming.
As soon as mark says he's  95% on this deal, it's gonna be off
It's funny how magire would be captaining multiple champion league winners 😂😂. Get that fool out of the club 😂
.......1/2 a pack of monster munch at the very most :)
United wouldn’t have problems if they had listened to ralf tbh.  Could of had Alvarez , Laimer , Moises then added Casemiro , Martinez, Antony and malacia to that and it would of been a decent start for ETH.
You should not only be watching womens football but as a NEWS show you should be promoting it.disgusting.
We can bring anyone in . As long as Maguire starts we in trouble . Too slow from the back , too much pressure on DDG . If Rashford and Sancho two wings , we still in trouble . Dalot is crap . Mcfred , I'd rather not watch .
Casemiro TERMS Agreed! Good Signing  😀
I am sorry Mark but I can't agree that De Jong was just Glazers or Arnold's or Murtogh's fault. It's Ten Hag's fault as well. It started right at the start of his tenure when he gave up on Ragnick's plans and went for players he knew.
Glazers in brilliant move 😁😁😁
Why not go for marcelo , ramos , modric , get reals 2017 team back together
Good or bad deal, we need Glazers out
Real madrid must love us...
Glazers are the biggest problem at Man utd! They must go and take  Arnold + Murtough with them
Casemiro Wil be on something strong  if he will leave RM and come to Manchester united
Harry Maguire would legit become a certified legend overnight if he and other players went on strike and refused to play
I love this show but with the sort of news coming out from united i kinda hate it as well. Lol like, don't you havw anything positive to say? And the answer is nope.
If Casemiro come to Manchester...then why not frenkie de Jong comes. something different growing in man UTD that we don't know i think
To be honest we need him alot because we lacked such since we lost trust in Matic. So we just realized how six is so much important both in defense and attack
Can we pls sell mctominey
Casemiro is way better than McFred but that transfer fee though
We will survive relegation with casemiro joining
Ok we need to brace ourselves We have been screaming for a CDM for quite a few years now, and we r one step closer to getting that. We have excused fred bcos he is forced to play without a CDM and bruno because he isn't given the creative freedom he needs.   Casemiro is a proven, world class CDM and now it should become obvious to us if other players were the problem or casemiro will solve our teams midfield issues.  We r slowly getting there, its time for us to judge the team now and see where we really stand.
Look at that a little unrest, talk of takeover and boom one on the way and a bid high bid rejected. They think this is how they keep us quiet.
Still will need a winger and a midfielder even if we sign casemiro
60 million for a 30 year old
I heard we are going to pay him 400k a week which is mental. Lol he is amazing but this is poor business. 70 million for 30 year lol Richard Arnold is no different from Ed Woodward. They were mates in uni
Madrid sells players who are about to decline badly eg varane
Alexis, pogba, varane were world class till they played for utd. Casimero will be no different.
Will be missing fdj saga lol
I dont mark blaming Carrasco for going to China when these players think about their families first. Reminds me of oscar as well. Some things are bigger than football
GLAZERS OUT
So are we gonna buy Modric next season? Maybe Kroos after before he retires. Marcelo? Maybe Perez later for Arnold.. smh. I like Casemiro ngl, but u have to admire United's multi million pounds scouting network, stealing a living there
I actually think ten hag should just consider losing to liverpool on monday. Make it louder. Even if we  tried we’d probably get slaughtered anyway.
What happen to the momentum we had when we were literally inside the old Trafford, protesting.
Why can't we sign Tielemans too? Trying to chuck 115mill bid for Felix when the biggest loop hole is in midfield.
They got nothin on our Maguire!
Roy Keane should come in as a discipline teacher.. Give him that role to kick some lazy axsxs
whatever the damn signing is gonna be,, McFridge and Mc FRED will still play. total clowns
we can't get bullied and taken as fools to clap them and get knocked off our focus to getting them out of from our club with these desperate signings with no plan and vision they don't sign prime target our new manger ETH so am saying GLAZERS OUT BIG BIG TIME!!!!
I am sure you guys are smarter than this to be excited signing a player reaching his peak. United is now the Madrid retirement home. His coming in for the paycheck and will not be motivated at all to perform at the highest level
carrasco is better than ziech .whats this guy on.. hes underrated tbh
Get another anchor to focus on WSL.
We want casamiro
GLAZERZOUTTTT
These are wasteman.  John moving sketchy. Like they all sleazy guys
Retirement Home FC signs another old age famous player for charity. It would have been a great signing if we were signing 25 year old Casemiro.
De Jong is still on. Watch this space
Mark Casemiro is 30years old why pay so much for such a worn out player
Manchester United is finished 😔 Casemiro for 70m wtf
IF Casemiro joins, I bet he either gets a long term injury or just flops like so many other 'great signings'.
Imagine if baily had played the last two games. Bet ya we wouldn't of lost
Most Premier league teams have strengthened their subs bench now there is the 5 substitution rule We are still trying to sort out our midfield for the first eleven...
Manchester United buying every Madrid player from their 3x UCL winning team.
20:13 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
You people never learn with this your 13 times champion league winner again! You did the same with Your signings last season and where it got you guys.
Same as Brazil.... Casemiro and Fred
Mark Goldbridge  is the most delusional  person.  Every  time he changes his story  on transfers  and opinions
Not Likely ! Why would anyone want to sell any Cash Cow ?!
Glazers out!!!
Go get Yuri to partner Casimero
Signing another player to warm the bench. Really sickening!
Apparently, Dortmund is interested in Cristiano Ronaldo... We should ABSOLUTELY do this deal if we can get Youssoufa Moukoko as part of it ( he is yet to sign an extension) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First 8 seconds just made ma day 😂😂😂😂
How's maguire going to captain these world class players
Mark keeps ignoring Ole when talking about Glazers not getting players managers wanted. It’s almost like they bought all the players Ole wanted. He wanted Haland, Bellingham and Khoulibaly etc. they shafted him too😂😂😂
We still won't get anywhere near europa spots either
Carrasco would actually be a decent signing. He has pace, skills and he works real hard. Not because he went to china means he woudnt be useful while we need it.   The club was always ready to spend on a midfielder this summer. if u guys noticed, they've quickly identified a player since the de jong deal expired.
Why can't United go for Moussa Diaby instead of Carassco or the overpriced Antony.
Don't buy official merch, have a total lock out
Frankie d' wrong Adiós who cares about the wages and the fee Ff's just get the deal over the line
Don't back the Glazers no matter who we sign, we had it enough 🟨🟩🟨🟩🟨🟩🟨
casemiro really ruining his career, 5 ucls with kroos, modric, camavinga and all those promising talents  how much is he being paid to play with bruno, eriksen, mctominay and fred
I dont care whatever people want to said. I just want to see him wearing our kit and play at old trafford...that'all
To be fair now we have a way better midfield than Brazil
Why would he leave RM
First everybody is Glazers out someone want to buy the club, the very next day sign Casemiro and nobody is talking about the Glazers, the Glazers are GENIUSES
Casemiro and caicedo should be signed
I hope that Garner can learn from Casimero
70 million euros for a 30 year old player is a fucking joke. United is shambolic
I'm not saying don't go to the game, but if you don't I will appreciate it
Casemiro, Ericksen Fred Or casemiro ericksen Donny
Hey Mark, a other awesome show. Could not you organise the campaign?
I was about to buy a Casemiro jersey , i m glad i bought the  Benzema one ..
Casemiro was not a target for ETH , as good as player he is. He wanted FDJ and would Casemiro suit the ETH way of playing football ?
I hate the Glazers too but shitting on the season and the new generation of Devils is a bridge too far for me.
You want players to go on strike ? How on earth you can even think that ? Not all man united players are fans of the club. They earn their bread and butter by playing for the club however bad they are the club have given them contract . Just imagine how bad it would like for their cv just because the owners are greedy ?? Lol just be realistic
Imagine if we pull.of dejong now I know its impossible but 😅
Watch United buy casemiro and Antony and the glazers out stuff will quiet down I don’t want signings I want new owners
Casemiro is the player we really need. Proper cdm
I love watching this channel thx for the passion
Really good cdm in the world. Bravo.....get kroos also and give him captain. .Maguire  no more captain.
Is Casemiro a ETH request or a player to appease Ronnie?
Glazers out. That said, until we get them out.  There is still a season to play. ' I rather watch a team with Casemiro, and perhaps Carrasco. Surely if there is no alternative.  U say Carrasco is a mercenary. In our current team, is see a lot of players that dont care to run and are massively overpaid. If Carrasco runs and puts in a  effort. U can call him whatever U like :)
Goldbridge seems pissed we didn't get FDJ as he was clinging onto 90% club. I like Casemiro. Still Glazers Out as always
Typical United paying over the odds for a 30 year old.
United will be interested in Hulk next just watch lol
As well as casimiro???
Beth was talking about £25 million for yuri Tialimans?? Why are we not buying Y.T instead a bargain for 25 mill?? Mark...
guys iam telling you women's team play way better than mend team I day
New owner 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Man Utd grabbing old Real Madrid stars.
They are just finding all Ronaldo friend to make him stay. Next is Marcelo Ricardo Quaresma
Great show
Great sub options Casemiro, Eriksen, donny haha
“There’s nothing wrong with giving £60m for a 30 year old” Wow, isn’t it same Mark always criticizing the club when they go got old players? Now £60m for a 30 year old isn’t wrong anymore? Say whatever you want but Madrid are ripping us off big time!
cant wait for him to sit on the bench for mctominay😌
Bloody China paid them multiple times more. Wouldn't even blink. And most international players don't really give a toss about the clubs they represent and why should they. Its a job.
Another thing that needs calling out is everybody who insisted Barcelona couldn’t register their players without selling De Jong……..wtf happened to that??!! I trusted you!!!
Great player but hopefully it won't be another Shweinsteiger
Ronaldo to Borussia Dortmund
All goes to The Glazers and the board, Mark.
New Castle wanted Carrasco n changed their mind on him...
There’s no denying Casemiro’s quality as a player but he is 30.  Can’t help but feel he chose Utd for a last big pay day rather than being successful. Also very noticeable in the champions league final that he is slowing down a lot. Really strong in the tackle and ball interceptions, but won’t bring much to the pace and dynamism of your midfield which is what you desperately lack imo. Not really a signing for the long term either.
Did I just hear Mar say we should be buying this type of players and doing this deals all the time? This is what the Glazer have been doing since, buying players to sell shirts and paying them huge salaries. The Glazer spin is clearly working 🤣🤣🤣
this man can play the midfield by himself......I like this signing!!!!
That bread analogy!! Brought a wee tear to me eye . Funny.
Wow casemiro and varene goin to be bench watching fred and lord Maguire playing  Extraordinary
why can't united go for a younger player, he's not even a ball carrying midfielder. this has panic buy written all over it.
the young man  was looking for some cash in China............do not hold that against him..........he is a good player.....better than anyone on the right side!!
Our will forever be in panick mode with these owners and mgmt...
If shining casimero good retirement nothing change Manchester united
The culture we live in demands you agree lock step or you’re divisive. Don’t agree but that’s how it is these days
Varane and Malacia signings were quick as well
And none of the players we are after now we’re on any list, especially ETHs list!!
I'm sorry but this is a stupid deal. Just another mistake for crazy wages for a 30 year old.  Smart business for Real Madrid, yes Casemiro is good but the amount we are shipping out for a 30 year old, and here Mark is celebrating it.  Glazers win again.
The fact that the glazers thought nothing would come of lack of signings and are surprised by the reactions of fans.
If you want to hurt glazers from all over the world, unfollow all official MU social network accounts and before doing that, inform them in the comment why you are doing it. This is the only thing that comes to mind.
About time we got a replacement for Carrick isn't it?
And we getting casmiro for 60 …hw is that a bad business?
Casemiro is 30 yo. I can't be too excited about that, another panic buy.
Sign casemiro... Just hope he doesn't get benches by mcfred
No one cares Glazers out
Why all the manager allow this hopeless average  overrated  Maguire,  Rashford and Mc Tominay to play????????? Whole world knows they are so bad and average players.
Reminds me of when we chased Fabregas all summer and settled for Fellani at the last minute…
Still a surprise to me that United ain't in for Florian Grillitch... superb midfielder, press resistant, most importantly, a SPECIALIST CDM! and he's free
I feel mark over exaggerate things … how much did chelsea sign koulibally at 30
Till the day Casamiro hold the shirt up and put down the pen he is NOT a done deal
Mark can’t see that Casemiro is a stupid signing at these numbers
No Frankie de jong glazer's out embarrassing as a football club I agree mark
NOOOOOOOOO not true as usual
Hakimi isnt happy at PSG. Idk if he’s available but that’s the RB we need
Vinicius, Antony, Beckenbaur, Cruyff and Gert Müller next!! Come on United!!
Casemiro coming to sit on the bench as backup for McTominay - same as Varane is backup for Maguire.
Alexis Pogba vibes! Mufc is not rebuilding but repeat its history lol
I actually reluctantly subscribed to united stand last week. I’m absolutely obsessed with Utd and our transfer window. It’s a shambles. Once a day update is enough though mate. I’m absolutely sick of it, tune it down a little please 🙏
Real Madrid pulling Man Utd’s pants down, as usual 👍🏻 20years nearly been doing it
So this basically confirms United won’t be signing De Jong and instead opted to buy a 30 year old for 70 mil which Ten Hag probably DID NOT want and in the end he said “F@&$ it” I don’t care who comes in anymore😂 panic buy at its finest👍🏻
I still think they get De Jong or at least try again for him. I'm certain Ten Hag would have been in contact with him. Hopefully they will keep Garner too. Those three will give us a decent midfield.
How is it possible for Casermiro to be in the same team as these players? i cant see it happening. Unless Casermiro is ready to sell his soul.
It's the retirement club already....  *GLAZERS OUT ALL DAY*
Hopefully the deal with casemiro goes through and we should also pay the remaining ten million ajax wants for Anthony and we get both players
“… and Eric Bailey looks like another player to leave Manchester Utd” Me: let’s goooo Mark: on. Loan
will we sell James Garner for 15 million and buy him back for 70
"HE'S ONE PLAYER" we have mcfred mate they are one player together 😅🤣
Verane - Casimero-Ronaldo..The Spine..but GLAZERS OUT
Don’t care. The only person I want in the club is Sir Jim
Breaking news - Eriksen had second heart attack after playing with Maguire and Mctominy
Instead of organising protests out side old trafford organise them outside sponsors head quaters
Casemeros carrer will go downhill but its a good place for him to retire at united with huge wages
Only at United these things happen. One day Rabiot,  next day Casemiro. Most big clubs buying the nect big thing. United only buys players who clubs want to let go.
Throw the youth out there and let them sink or swim. Way cheaper and more hunger.
Varane and casimero united once again! Letss goooooo!!!
19:40 it’s not. We’re deteriorating. They’re treating us like cattle.   Time FOR THE TO GO!!!!!
Don't forget Dumfries, we really can use his energy in the squad
What number will Casemiro wear?
All Ten Hag need to do is give some of the younger players a chance and see their impact. At least they would be playing the game he wants it to be played. Start Varane and Martinez as the center back pairing, use Malacia and Dalot as the wing backs, start Donny, Fred, Mctominay
Antony is ours! Antony is ours! MUFC basterds antony is ours!!! ❌❌❌
Are we now real Madrid legends  FC
Even if we sign casemiro,  we still need another creative midfield and a striker
How this useless board didn't even think about Neves for me he's the one and Raul Jiminez as our striker
How old is United's lastest £60m player ?
Casemiro is an upgrade on your midfield (anybody is tbh), but he’s another signing that you’re putting on a huge wage that is just a short-term fix. He is a continuation of an incredibly poor transfer strategy that targets random players to try and placate the fans when you’re in crisis. Really, you need to do the opposite - stop handing out huge contracts, get rid of those that are already at United on huge contracts sponging off the club, and get players that actually want to play for the shirt.
Online fans not ONLY. Stay woke friends
Mark am from Uganda but you have spoken 100 percent my mind. How do I join you to send these Americans out?
Am I the only person on the entire planet who thinks Ronnie should just knuckle down on his massive contract and play football for his team that desperately needs him? Why do you want him to leave man? I don't get it at all.
Casameiro is genuinely a better singing then de Jong. Definitely much more what we need in this team however still get the glazers out
Jim Will Fix It!!!
We should sign Bowen, pay whatever it takes
Casemiro in the Championship..  scenes
Wtf are you on mark, he's past his best and has no hunger left. Why the hell are we buying a CDM that's past his peak. We should be buying the likes weilg , berge or tousart young hungry CDM that will increase in value and won't have that flipping pogba effect of a huge price tag. We do not need another has been
ETH is an idiot Macguire over Varane laughable. De jong ??? just another bold guy who tries to seem to be smart... just another fool...
Maybe we should start promoting players from the academy
We have got enough of us to short the stock as a collective and crash the price, think opposite to game stop and amc meme stocks, minipulate the share price. Bring the market cap down further!
Another desperate signing, he needs just one game with Maguire and McFred to start crying for Modric and Kross
Great player but  Stupid signing unless you're also  buying Toni kroos. casemiro is a good defender but doesn't have ball progression. Toni Kroos had to drop down in order to compensate for his lack of quality. United panic buying again.
What happened to ten hag changing things this is the most typical united signing you could have imagined
Next breaking news Ronaldo part of the deal
I feel so disillusioned with the club, making the same mistakes over and over. They have lost their way. This season is a right off. Club needs a complete rebuild from top to bottom, from the board, management and players.
Gakpo a baller need to land him Asap!!
10H's first decision if Case comes- give him the captaincy.
Manchester United are close to an agreement with Real Madrid for midfielder Casemiro in a deal worth just shy of £60m.   The exact fee is £50.7m plus £8.5m in add-ons.  A four-year deal plus the option of a further 12 months is on the table.  It is unlikely that an agreement will be completed in time for Casemiro to be available for United's next Premier League clash, as he requires a visa.  Erik ten Hag's side take on Liverpool at Old Trafford on Monday, live on Sky Sports.  Strong amazing welcome
Is Casemiro be good enough to bench Mctominay? 😁😁
Richard branson?????
Ten hag is at fault for De Jong. He is the one who wanted him. He convinced United that he would want to play for him. He fucked up.
Very good signing happy with that a solid cdm I have always said it I would prefer an older cdm like Casemiro as it’s and important position to get right.
Why oh why oh why has Casamiro decided to go to United? From La Liga and UCL winners to fighting for a place in the Europa Conference League.
Short the stock on reddit wall street bets.
I wish utd win europa this year and thrashes Barcelona next year in Cl final and that will be a perfect response to insult De Jong did to this club
Desperate buys will cost huge transfers fee and huge salary .
Who's Croos? You mean Kroos?
Are there any updates on savic??
United should buy Casimero and Laimer.. then move for a RW and ST in the January window.. we need another CB but we need to off load Maguire first... of course none of this will happen with the Glazers in charge..
GREEN AND GOLD TILL OUR CLUBS SOLD GLAZERS OUT 🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰
When casemiro arrives please have maguire hand over the captaincy to him.
What the hell is happening. Casemiro is finished. How the hell do you want to get him. It's crazy. Bloody crazy. People getting fresh new players and we get Casemiro and Carrasco??? ❌❌❌❌❌
casemier after the bag 💰 dont blame him Manchester united is run by stupid people.
Varane was meant to be starting every game too
Seems like United supporters has been fooled by the Glazers again.
25 million for carrasco is a bargain, good player. Not just a pace merchant like rashford, got proper skills
Man U is becoming like a retirement home for former great players from Real Madrid -Ronaldo,Varane and Casemiro.
If they sign Casemiro still the Glazers need to GO we no longer their pets we are true United Fans they are very weak in everything
Boycotting Glazers is still on tho
I hope Chelsea decide to sell us Kanté next.
MCFINALLY bridge
Not doubting his quality but 60million for a nearly 31year old on 350k a week is literally absurd..  Why utd just get Ruben Neves in.. Aged 25,knows the league so it's a no brainer..
I knew the football gods copied mark goldbridge career mode when Tottenham batteted united AFTER they did it to mark ... n wen ronaldo returned ... bare of em lol
Andy Carrol is available
Jealous of casemiro? nah mate you should be grateful and pray that the deal goes through
Brilliant signing!
We could still get de jong on loan with garantee to buy next season and we pay the 17 million in wages
มีข่าวชือนักแตะเป็น100คนตั้งยังไม่ได้แต่งตังเทนฮาดเป็นโค้ชแมนยู ช้ามากๆชือนั้กแตะ บอร์ดไม่ทำตามสัญญากับโทนฮาดแย่วะ้
Simples,GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine Liverpool go and Hijack it now ? lol
Don’t forget people still the glazers out
This guys fucking deluded liverpool jealous if liverpool want casemiro they would have bought him if he’s so good how come nobody else wants him makes me wonder why he’s going to a team with no champions league 😜🤪
It doesn’t matter who comes in.  Getting the Glazers OUT is the focus ……..they could bring in Casemiro, Antony, still get DeJong, and a striker in this window. Don’t care. Glazers Out
Casemiro is not worth $60 millions
this is a mercenary deal,  we should got declan rice
Glazers OUT OUT OUT!
DELETE THE APP from your phone
Great player in the position we really need. But he is 30 so he will not be at his peak for long and will he play Ten Haag Ball?  Madrid were not a pressing team last season so again this is not part of a plan but just some desperation.   Don't get me wrong, I'll bite your hand off for him because we need a proper CDM desperately.
What the hell casemiro? From top of the world, to europa league😂😂 mans ready for some big Stress.
Casemiro will be a fool if he goes to Man Utd...🤣🤣🤣.  Unless he got millions and millions.
This feels like a pipe dream but if we do get him then Erickson Fred Casimiro midfield seems like something that might work
Man u r on the right track we need this type of aggression on the market yearly ......
You want glazers OUT ? Stop buying shirts and going to old trafford and communicate to Asian fans to open their mind about the situation
No one can dispute Casemiro is a world class cdm but didn’t we all think the same of varane last season and look how that worked out for us! £60m for a 30 year old seems like a lot to me. Not happy about a singe signing this season we looks set up for defeat!
I won't believe this casemiro talk until he's holding up the shirt
I've said for years, United just keep kicking the can down the road. Casemiro is world class and has a few years left at the top in him but signing talented players isn't anything new. The problem is this continues the theme of paying players exorbitant wages to make a move they don't want to make. All these signings are part of why United's dressing room is so toxic
You don’t know how we are getting Casemiro?  We are paying 2X what he’s worth, to a team he’s not even starting on 🤣 this deal is a complete joke.  Buying old midfielders from lower leagues to try and adjust to EPL speed and constant press is like trusting the Glazers to run a business well
Man U wants the entire Atlético De Madrid team lol
What the Glazers don't understand is, that they can spend a billion pounds from now to the end of the transfer window.... but that won't get us back the 6 points we've already lost this season.. prevention is better than cure...
Another 30+ year old cashing in his retirement 🙄😂
We need antony.
They backed Ole… that’s a mind f**k.
IF Ronaldo stays we will have half the spine of prime Real Madrid Varane Casimero and Ronaldo and knowing the team as a whole we will still fail even with that 🙄
Calling someone divisive is divisive
Watch Casemiro be signed tommorow, able to be played vs Liverpool, and McFred still starts.
I guess everything is alright with the glazers now yeah?  U lot are pathetic
Is Raul available?
No more 90% then
Glazers out but sign Casemiro for midfield stability
Great buy. De Jong should have been dumped long ago.
Mate I'd Trade Donny Van De Beek and 10m for Tielemans right now. DvB stock has dropped, he obviously isn't going to start, and hopefully it would fuel him to get back to his best. All while we have a good player in Tielemans who could work well with Casemiro. Fix the midfield and the attack will be able to really have a chance to shine.
This isn't happening, it's famtasy
Do you think the situation  ov cr7 wanting to leave ov no players coming in so getting  casemiro will keep cr7 sweet so he stays
Glazers out
De gea Dalot, Verane, Martinez, Malacia  Van de beek, Casimero Pulisic, Eriksen, Sancho  C.Ronaldo
sounds like he's coming wahooooo
21.55 That sums it up perfectly LOL
GLAZERS OUT - The ONLY story in town   GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT GLAZERS OUT
I would rathr old trafford was burnt to the fkn ground than the glazers be here for decades to come
If ETH uses the youth he gets more time.Better than buying whatever's left on the shelf.
I hope we get this Casemiro done.
I've seen plenty of Madrid fans on twitter today genuinely upset he's leaving, that says it all, as for the timing of the deal, what do we all expect? Let's keep the glazer out movement going!
Someone should make a compilation of Mark tucking his shirt in the first few seconds of the show 😂
Liverpool supporter here, I wouldn’t love him
Add tielemens too then we’re set!
I just watched fabrizo say nothing about agreeing a deal.
I didn't want to watch these transfer news videos because I was scared that I'd change my mind about the Glazers, but I realized that if a signing was enough to change my mind, then I'm not good enough for this beautiful club. GLAZERS OUT!
mark could you get a load of red electric tape give it to the crew to ask fans to cover sponsers outside old Trafford it means nothing for those watching but its massive for the glazers pocket
If we are going to judge players on the character and actions off the filed where was the scruity for the signing of Ronaldo from Mark given the evidence that was leaked about the sexual assualt (R*pe) allegation and the fact that the judge said the lawyers method of obtaining the evidence was the issue not the evidence itself. No video from Mark on it at all so that does that mean its not the values or character but the offender that is the issue???  It's not wrong to get the most suitable players, ability & behaviour wise, but the checks should be consistent for all players coming in.
RONALDO to Borussia Dortmund
did he play fall guys? say's he is offline
GLAZERS OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT
GOATbridge is not making the connection between FRED and CASEMIRO! Selecao's midfield at United! cmon!
In as much as casimero will be a good addition but I don't see the hunger in him anymore for titles. We should be signing hungry players who be here for a long project. Casimero has won it all and for me, I really don't see the hunger in him anymore but let's hope he proves me wrong.
We agree terms with every club just can’t sign the player .. we are a joke of a club
How the hell have we pulled off getting casemiro
another overpaid player but then again, who wants to come man utd right now
Same mistake over and over again
Am tired with united transfer because they transfer is like women who wants sex but don't want babies
ETH can't let Maguire to captain United after having Varane, casmiero and Ronaldo.
I’ve seen Christian Pulisic’s name thrown around. Any thoughts?
@sirjimIN
Glazers out already
Sir Jim come on in @SirjimIN
So is Garner still been sold???
Even if we get him we shud have got de jong Anthony dunfries and others glazers still out bet casimiro will be the last signing they won't do anything else and that's not good enough
20 players out  20 players in
Don’t get the Casemiro hype - is he just a good tackler or does he have more to his game ?
Glazers years & years of Dividends and Nothing else.
Hate seeing this club I love fall an we can’t stop it get out now😡😡😡
Bennaser AC Milan midfielder younger and better then casemiro Casemiro won every single cup in the competition what going to motivate him
I can say with 100% certainty that Casemiro will NOT be joining Man Utd this summer..... Or any other summer for that matter.
Top 5 ways to ruin your career
Need get theses owners out bleeding us dry
We might as well get Declan Rice if we going to pay that wages to Casemiro. Over 5 years the Rice deal would be better and he is younger 🤔
Where fall guys then?
Not Gary Neville !!!  I
I always used to think you had to get an offer with the club agreed before speaking to a player...or is that just old school years ago :)
If Casemiro excels maybe brazilian talent will start coming to man united.... Also go for Marcos Leonardo of Santos.
You talk the biggest load of bollocks, earlier this week you did not want negativity. I would get a job at Tesco if I were you!
Ferguson Fletcher and board out first before Glazers. Journey man midfielder FLETCHER picking team. Ten Hag is a good 🐶 puppy, with no testosterone.
United is poop 💩
We are crap
The Intro I do When I try to Copy him after opening the video!!
Good impression
Bring Zidane into first team
Give it a few days and the headline will be Casmeiro signs new deal at Madrid but yet still makes a pointless nothing video about a total made up transfer rumour
We need to trust in youth
Eric bailly is so underrated
All week Mark was harping about running the football club with a lower wage bill. All of a sudden he acts like casemiro is on 20 grand a week....can't trust a word coming out of his mouth....😂😂😂😂😂
Madrid are pulling our pants down. £60m for a 30 year old. Ridiculous !!!
Carrasco is a ok player, but it is more like to replace a crucial player in the game. Let's say second half and on.  He is good to have him for that.
2:44 It's all about the structure ❤❤❤🙂🙂🙂
Man U is a retirement ground for ultra successful Real Madrid players who have achieved it all and have nothing else to prove. United have no ambition or objectives and they will get a lot of extra cash before retirement. Perfect.
this guy is dying to deepthroat ronaldo. wtf. backs him no matter what. the guy has pissed on our beloved club, and all this guy wants is that piss on his forehead. smh.
Cunha, felix, carrasco. Sure were in madrid anyway...... Desperation FC
Still no lesson learnt. Last minute deals again! ETH has been let down massively. Not one of his first choices through the door. Casemiro is good yeah but I have a feeling that’s all we will get. And if they let garner go that sums united up. He deserves a chance to play over donny and mctominay.
The obvious problem about the players going on strike would be why would they? Maguire probably can't believe his luck like many other players, they push for a new owner they would effectively be pushing themselves out the door because they are useless.
This will end badly, we shouldn’t be buying Casamero. He is on the decline
I honestly don't know man. He's 30.
Imagine the scenes when Casemiro and Varane are watching McFred and Maguire from the bench
The Board need to be more proactive in trying to sign Anthony.
SO: Real bought Casemiro 10 years ago for 5 mill now they sell it for 60 mill after he won 5 champions and he's gonna get pay more than he  ever got payed before! That's business!
We need MOISES CACEIDO!!!
Why does it feel like United scouts are bunch of lazy people who has limited knowledge and range… RM got new and younger players to replace Casemiro… while United looking to follow its shadows… why can’t these scouts discover a 23 year old Casemiro, there is one somewhere.United are the Florida retirement home for footballers
Glazer Family out now
also are we a Real Madrid B Team?
Even Doo they sign casemiro, Anthony, De jong, Dumfries, gakpo, sesko, milinkovic savic!!! Still on Glazers out
Mark > McFred
DEAL IS OFF! You heard it here first.
United is the new china
what is his injury record like? This is a replacement for Matic
Its not signed for either player. So no deal done until contract signed!!
yes
Why do you want a player who will only come to max out his income before retirement. Yet again the wrong profile of player with the wrong motivations and clearly they have learned nothing from recent years.
Anyone ever told you you look like Wayne Rooney?
They could try to do something bright while they are in madrid and enquire about benzemas availablity, probably the best ‘veteran’ forward on the planet
Glazers stil get out
prove me wrong but casemiro is 30
Glazers Out
Cancer club,your dead to the world
80 m bid rejected for Antony
I want to adopt Wayne Rooney and cuddle with him by the fireplace
I really really love him
Don’t care what terms are agreed… glazers out
I love Wayne Rooney
Bullshit, Casemiro is not going to give up a starting position at a champions league winner for a team in shambles which are ending 8th this season
Their transfer policy is all over the place man
Manchester united: *Buys a world class player , varane* Also manchester united: *Uses maguire instead of him*
he should be captain
Well if he comes It’s a step in right direction…he won’t solve the problems
Until he’s at carrington training, I’ll believe
Been down this road before. Not going to believe this until I see him signing a contract
Cas would be a fool to come united
Mark your 110% bang on the button with our summer transfer window. It’s an absolute disgrace what the glazers have done with all there smokescreen malarkey including the debacle over Frenkie De Jong. They are an absolute joke and how they got into power at old Trafford is beyond me. Hopefully Sir Jimmy Ratcliffe can buy them lot out and bring our mighty club back to where it needs to be. P.S. Keep up the good work.
I love that United fans have fallen down the hole of crazy.... What do you think is going to happen? Casamero, Veran and Ronaldo are going to create a the 'save the club trio'.  Hahaha even the club legend amongst them is captined by a wally and will walk away hating the club, good luck on the other two becoming ANYTHING at this club lol.
5 will get you ten it's another player past his best carrying an injury......
Casimero's legs are going tho. Madrid's not stupid. There's a reason he's being sold.
McFred will still be first choice.
Have we even signed casimero???
His won everything the hunger has gone
No wonder this club has become a joke. It's now becoming a Real Madrid retirement club. Next bring in Keylor Navas as Dea Gea replacement. Casemiro is a class DM.👍
Is about time people don’t talk about transfer fees and start to look at total contract value.
What people don't seem to know is Ten Hag bought people no one really wanted and turned them in beasts Tadic, Haller, Blind and Klassen are a good example you could say like no one wants Ziyech now but under Ten Hag he was something else and don't bring the Eredevise excuse cause there Champions League performance was superb if it wasn't for their defensive mistakes Ajax would be a regular UCL semi final team.
Out out out out
Did ten hag want him noo
Don't even name them enough is enough
Mimicking Carrager 😹
I thought the De Jong deal was 90% likely to happen
De jong and casimero our midfielders
60 million 🤯
Mark - You can’t always get what you want in the transfers. You have to have excellent options b,c and d. I think they tried to get the top targets for the managers. This was confirmed be Ricky!
Casemiro and martinez in midfield yes m8👍
Kills me when you emulate Carragher 😂😂😂
Glazers Out!!!!!
Get Anthony
Wow man united turning into retirement home for real madrid
This doing the right thing at the rough time!!! Glazers out
His coming for the fucking wages
We’re signing “soon to be deadwood “ players ...
How can they let bailly go. On his day he is our best centre back
I would love casemiro to come but how long b4 he gets complacent like the rest of them. I had faith in bruno, rashford, pogba etc. And look what happened.
With Casemiro, another creative CM and Antony we would boost our squad tremendously.
Haha United is a joke. +500 thousand a week to ask the player to lower his standards.  Why ask for a new process.  You guys are addicted.  if u just want abit more heroin every time you stop, your done!!!
Can’t wait for him to be benched over a tinpot player like they did with Varane👍
Prefer Casemiro to de jong anyway
That would be three multiple Champions League winners for Maguire to captain - Imagine that!!
😂😂😂😂 30 year old 60 million never learning from there mistake joke
5 mil cheap
Bellerin?
WHAT ?! poor casemiro
Glazers out.. SPIN SPIN SPIN..  ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
I know it’s a dream scenario but de jong and Casemiro would be incredible, will NEVER happen but it could have happened if we planned it…
Carrasco is solid
huge signing for MU. with ronaldo in the front, verane in the back, Casemiro in the middle, with few more signings like these, MU will become a retiree team for real madrid .
Casemiro shouldn't ruin his career
At least Varane will have a friendly face on the bench, while Maguire and McFred will start every game.
Right now just fresh players we need also why ain’t varane starting over maguire
What we saying when's the casimiro deal is off...by Monday??
Casemiro downgrade confirmed! Here we go!!!
goldbridge is feeln good today😹😹 let this man elevate your mood
hope we do more business
Confime??
Confime??
glazers in ❤
The whole world should be glazers out. The longer the glazers are there the more likely we are threatened with a super league again. GLAZERS OUT!
Casemiro stay in real
Guess Glazers didn't lile the 🗞 headlimes last 36-48 hrs.  Game is on Mkmday.  Nothing's changed. 🔰 UNITED v GLAZER6 🔰
Another multiple champions league winner for Maguire to captain. Anyone know when Murtough is flying to Madrid to complete the deal??
Man United need new investment and then they can sign a whole new squad and they can sell their rubbish players
BRISTOL BANKERS GLAZERS OUTTTTT OUTTTTT
