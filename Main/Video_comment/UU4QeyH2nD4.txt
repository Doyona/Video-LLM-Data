Helium, lithium, magnesium, titanium, ALUMINUM? Wtf america😂😂

In Indonesia, most of english words are from English UK. Alumunium is really the rights words

"You wrap your sandwich with it" Kid with monocle and curly stashe in the back: gold
English teacher here: there are dozens of common words with different spelling or meaning in British and American English. It's fun! 😅😂😊
My brain : alumnium
Im weird and black people deserve to absolutly just live the best life
I just screamed out laughing in the train station and my voice echoed.
Don't care if my grades go down i a  jot saying *"AlUmiNum"*
Yeah the americans changed it so they didnt have to associate with us europeans
As Russian I support British way( we say aluminiy,so it’s more aluminium than aluminum)
And then there is one of my Dr. In university who says it in the weirdest way. He pronounces it as "Almunium" 😂😂😂
Britons, adding extra letters to all their words and leaving the pronunciation at home
Aluminium is the correct one as it is closer to its root, the greek word (alouminio)
Its alluminum, theres two Ls
Aluminum was the original correct spelling coined by British Chemist Sir Humphrey Davey in 1812. The spelling was changed in Europe in the 90s because IUPAC wanted to standardise it to match other latin endings from elements on the periodic table. Sad so many British people bag on American english without even knowing their own history. In traditional English it is and has been Aluminum. Americans are actually the correct party in this case.
The British is closer to the original Latin spelling.  It’s the correct one.  But Brits have an apostrophe problem, which Americans don’t have.
I can't even form that word in my head to even let it out of my mouth.
Tin foil
avg american schools
MY AUTO CORRECT SAYS Alluminnium
Aluminium 😊   ALuminum🤑
I was thinking cyran wrap and I definitely don't knqow how to spell that with confidence
The language is literally called "English" we tell the Americans how to spell not the other way around xD
Americans can spell faster
We use aluminum because the person who saw it called it that
Least I don’t put a u in color
The reason why Americans call it Aluminum is because of a misspelling of Aluminium
Gringos 😂😂😂😂 I’m Engineer and first time I told a coworker hey it is better with this material and they never guess until I wrote it down 🫠🫠🫠🫠
ITS ALUMINIUM
le me almoniyam 🗿
Americans eh…
*You Probably Use This To Wrap Your Sandwich.*  *Meanwhile **_SUBWAY!_* 💀
I don't know about anyone else. But i've always called it tin foil
Both are correct. In Arabic we say aluminium
In french, we say "aluminium"
Uh oh I smell some MEE-THANE
Cause their American 🇺🇸
How much luck does this video have that after watching it I landed a job 🥵💀
In scientific circles, either pronunciation is acceptable.
Burst into laughter 😂
FUCK, IM SICK AND MY STOMACH HURTS WHENEVER I LAUGH THESE GODDAMN COMMENTS
we (americans) spell it that way because, as is the case with like 90% of these questions, that was how it was originally spelled in english. the british are the ones who had to be extra and change a bunch of the spellings to set themselves apart. 😂😅
I want to say Platinium as a Canadian.
It’s too extra
Actually in Germany it is called "Aluminium" and not "Aluminum".
Me just realising Americans changed their spelling: 👁️👄👁️ Me, a Canadian pronuncing it: "Aluminum" but spelling it "Aluminium" 🤔🤨🧐
Yo todo un castellano: aluminio ☝️🤓
🤣🤣
No. English is the mother tongue of around 500 million people around the world. About 75 million speak British English, 370 million speak American English, and 30 million speak Australian and New Zealand English. It is clear that American English has numerical superiority. So British English actually spells it weird. 🙄
amerians spell this word so strange beause they just clone of grea tbritain bruh
No joke, I lost points on a chemistry quiz for writing the British version
Me: C-Carbon?
What didn’t you know America invented words? No one could talk till they met the Indians and took their gold.
Technically you use aluminium oxide as well
I hate how Americans have different spelling like just stick with the same stuff and we'll have no problems.
Aluminum is just the right way to spell it.
Me: paper
Nah ..you said something else 😅
😂 I believe it's Aluminium, and also in Arabic we spell it exactly Aluminium
Bruh I watched this thing 10 times to figure out what's happening I just think I'm stupid
Aluminum Bro,"minum" in indonesia means "drink" 😂
Aluminuim 🤢
I prefer US words except for this one, I’m Lebanese and we say “Aluminium” instead of “aluminum” so I’m team British on this one
The guy who discover of aluminum pounced and spell it the way we Americans do, but the British community thought it wasn't Latin enough.
That "everybody hates chris " at the end brings back memories
Alualualula
"Aloomeniummm"
Sodium
Actually read it in a book, the business people wanted to sound more like platinum with the -num ending than common elements like sodium magnesium etc. I also find this mind-blowing! 😀
As an American, never in my life have I heard anyone pronouncing it with the extra 'i' until now.
I think that is Americans need help instead of the British in spelling
Aluminium sounds cooler than aluminum
Can I go off road
Tried searching up how google pronou c its im too lazy
there's the extra i in french too
Genuinely it baffles me how you don’t say aluminium, it sounds so much better and more like an element
People hating on british people but also hating on americans 😵

This is what, I am talking about, ever since they were given independence they have been crazy, doing insane stuff like changing how English is spoken.
You know it gets worse when you learn we have words like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis long word to describe a lung disease.

Teacher: You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches" Me: Zinc Teacher and class: Huh?  Proceeds to wrap a peanut-butter and jam sandwich with zinc sheets😅
Its actually aloomnum🤣
"You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches" Me: saran?
My friends and I recently had this discussion and it turns out that the American spelling is the more accurate one. "1812, coined by English chemist Sir Humphry Davy, from alumina, alumine, the name given by French chemists late 18c. to aluminum oxide, from Latin alumen "alum" (see alum). Davy originally called it alumium (1808), then amended this to aluminum, which remains the U.S. word. British editors in 1812 further amended it to aluminium, the modern preferred British form, to better harmonize with other metallic element names (sodium, potassium, etc.)."
Americans in 2030: Lithum, Sodum, Vanadum, Calcum, Helum
I prefer aluminum over aluminium
“You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches”  Tin? Or Saran Wrap
We say it the way its spelt...
a
wait a minute, i am american cuz Brazil is in americas and u said why "americans spell this word so strangelly" and here is just is pretty close to yours
Indians are so confused They say some words like Britishers And some like americans But we still don't say Bo oh o water 😂
Aluminum? I was gonna say saran wrap or plastic of some sort 😂
All Countries: Aluminum Americans: Alluminoom
ㅋㅋㅋ
Aluminum was named by British researcher Humphrey Davy in 1808.   Contemporaries outside of Britain (and perhaps inside it as well), did not like the name he gave it despite it being his right to pick the name, and in 1811,  a Swedish researching publishing in French called it aluminium.  This was followed in 1812 by another Brit pissed off about it not sounding classical enough also changed it to aluminium.   So the US/Canada calls it by its proper British name, and everyone else is using something else that makes them feel smarter about it.
I thought it was tin to wrap sandwiches
My right hand
I always learned to spell it aluminium but say (uh-loo-min-uhm)
Aluminum = eminem
the man who discovered Aluminum and gave it its name wanted to call it Aluminum but the science community whined and pouted about it wanting to call it Aluminium, thus proving that there is no extra i
Why you wrapping sandwiches in it???
IUPAC: *I'm gonna end this country's whole career*
Everybody haayyaates chewks
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's the American vs British spelling
Teacher: you use it to wrap your sandwiches   Me: plastic?  Teacher WHaT Do You MEAN!  Me: I MEAN I WRAP MY SANDWICHES IN PLASTIC!
I said "paper"
Extra help in what 😏
I was also confused as hell. Talk about the American spelling for Sulphur, sulphuric acid etc
Aluminum me who has been in Cameroon for 7 years: yeah it’s Aluminium
“You probably use this to wrap your sandwich”  My dumb mind: sArAn WrAp
I wrap my sandwich in... Paper. Is that... Weird?
I had this problem of American constantly telling me on social media to go learn how to spell. Most probably have no idea Ghana use’s British dictionary not American.
Aluminum/Aluminium was first coined by the British Humprhy Davis. However, he first called it Alumium.
Even Canada spells it “aluminum”, the rest of English-speaking countries, except the US, spells it “aluminium”.
I spell it slightly different from the red shirt dude alu-mon-yum
Or tinfoil
We spell it normally in america
It’s just one letter doh! You spell it strangely to me!
IT'S A LIGHTWEIGHT METAL THAT SOFTBALL BATS ARE MADE OUT OF OK!?!
"Americans" are all people who live in the American continent, not just in the United States
I'm french and we said aluminium so I was a bit confuse at first until I watch it again
Who tf knows how to to spell aluminum off the bat
uh I said polythene at first
Being from and still living the US I don’t know why
I say it as almunium
Yes they speak and say things different from English people
Aluminium is original latin name, Aluminum is translated, so he was right
I’m english
Ferrum???
I was not expecting the everybody hates chris refrence
Me, an Romanian: Aluminiu (Usually the last "i" would be very hearable, barely hearable or can't even be heard)
Meanwhile me who is Indian and says almunium but spells aluminium
Literally Americans are like SpongeBob with extra holes
If I remember correctly Alec Steele had this debate on his channel
I prefer aluminuminuminum
Latin: _exists_  US: _gunshot noises_
In Indonesia, it's "Alumunium"
Aluminium
In Germany its Aluminium too
Aluminium is the correct way
It's not the only word which is spelled differently in the US. "Color" "Colour"
The everybody hates Chris in the background😭👌
Even french is aluminium.

Spelling is like aloominun ngl
Its Aluminium
To je amelinum
In germany we say aluminium instead of aluminum
Technically, the American version is correct internationally, as American terms are used as the science standard.     And that’s one reason why the Brits hate the Americans
But you're also saying it with an "i" and not a "u" so you're saying it like . Aluminum Plus you spelled it wrong 🤣
I never ever have called it alimumim  It's always been aluminium  I don't know
Hi
Not even we Germans are spelling that so strangly

In Egypt people say "Alamonia"
My teacher who spells it “Almunium"
Aluminuminum
Aluminium is how it's spelled
Aluminium
Aluminium Aluminum Alunium Alum Adam Alien😅
A lot if words in Americans english have less letters, i heard it was because newspapers would cost more to make the more letters they used (probably because of the ink), so they intentionally spelled words wrong to save money
I blame the fact that the U.S.A is younger than England
Even here in Brazil we got two i's. (Alumínio)
Okay. I have had constant thoughts on this since I moved to the US from the UK when I was 21.  Yes, a British man discovered it an named it Aluminum, BUUUT - it’s Aluminium; you call it -nium from the suffix similar to Uranium, Titanium, Plutonium.
Because it falls out of their mouths .
Here in italy we Say alluminio so i would use the American pronunciation But that's Just me though
Tomatoes is a good one too
Didn't know American spell Helium as Helum
WTF?! Same in our Arabs countries!
This is on my dream.       You probably don't know what I was taking about
Thean who discovered it and put it on the periodic table was Danish and the Danish way to say wich is the correct way is aluminium
I use plastic

Newspaper charge by letter
question. If brits speak proper English then why is their way of speech considered an accent? Its not an accent if its the original way of pronunciation. Proper speech is pronouncing most words as they are spelled as best as possible. For example “boddle of wader” is better pronunciation than “bo-oh-uh-wa-ah”. If you were in a spelling bee and a brit said spell “Ham-buh-guh” and you spelled it as they said it you’d get it wrong but if he said “ham-bur-ger” you’d have a better chance of spelling it correctly. In this case the American accent is more proper due to you making sure to pronounce the word as it is spelled as best as possible depending on the word. Another example is the word “no”. Brits say “nohrrr” Americans say “noe”. which would you say is more proper?
Y’all weird not to e American
Why the extra I? That's a whole extra syllable my guy
It's Aluminium. End of discussion.
I totally said it in British English😂
Literally almost every other country: "Aluminium".
I thought alimunum
Which one the british? Is the red one?
I love the show everybody hates Chris
A loo mih num
It is actually Aluminium, but the Americans made a mistake when writing their dictionary and left out the "i", so now Americans call it "Aluminum"... although we all know Aluminium is the one true way of spelling it :)
I don’t know, why do brits say it so weird
Aluminum what?!! qtf is aluminum
yall american say words weird
I was thinking bread, br -> bronium
Ikr
In America and Canada and most other English speaking countries it is aluminum. I mean check the dictionary it is right there in America but in England it is aluminium.
Beacouse america want to make people mad
OMG GUYS MY WORD RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDED "Aluminum" NOT "Aluminium" 😭 MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE
Damn I'm a French speaker and I've always pronounced it that way 🤣🤣🤣
What I heard from the US one  Alu minion
I cant believe bread was my first guess…
how did i do it right I'm American
There's a lot of comments that state that in their native languages; Indian, German, Swedish etc. It's 'Aluminium'. English is not a sole language, it has borrowed some of it's words from other languages. So, seeing that many other languages pronounce it that way then it could be the correct way. But that doesn't mean Americans are incorrect, they just have their own way of pronouncing and saying certain words.
It's funny how people in the comments section are sort of attacking each other because their distinct English pronounciations. I can you, as a polyglot, and as a person who lives in a country where there are native languages that nobody gives a damn about English. is believed to be too vague and boring and you can't really express yourself as you would in other languages. The only reason why we speak it is because it's the universal language thus we have no choice.
The dude in the red hoodie was right, what sort of English do the Americans speak 😭😭😭😭 but we appreciate all levels of English, try an Aussie accent
Whichever american decided that it would be spelled 'aluminum' was legit mad.... Look at most of the elements.  I guess we use elements like magnesum, uranum, helum, and potassum... What the hell man
Me : Alloy....
This was bases off of the fact that printing presses costed us by the letter, so we dropped extra letters. Then we just dialectically changed
Nah, it's Almunium.
Wait I thought it was 男孩什麼鬼男孩
i said bread
So what exactly it is??  Aluminium or aluminum???
I'm an Indian and we follow British English and I'm pretty sure it should me Aluminium
I LOVE EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS
Who says it like the red hoodie one lol
Ikr I'm British like geez
It's Aluminium in India too
We spell a lot of things differently! Especially the words like flavour, we spell it without the U! And other things, such as spelt! Fun fact: spelt is spelled spelt everywhere except America, where it is spelt spelled.
it is a question not spelling bee
Its alumiNIum
I’ve always wondered why they pronounce it with extra letters lol
Why do Americans have such different vocabulary. Instead of anorak, they say raincoat and instead of aubergine, they say eggplant.
Cling film
hahahha poor guy
That's just an accent...no need to worry or work on for aluminum and aluminium 😊
I use aluminum but aluminium rolls off the tongue better
Biase la ameriks bahasa pun bukan bahasa sendiri tetibe je tukar ejaan,mcm sial lak
The one sound at the end had my favorite tv show song
It was called Aluminum first.  And if you compare the populace of the US, who all say it that way against with countries that say it aluminium--more people in the world say it aluminum than don't.    But even if that wasn't true, I don't take advice on spelling/pronounciation from the country that pronounces Lieutenant as "Leftenat"
When teacher said after Ethan it spelled incorrect 😂😂 all this video and still wrong
I said cling film...
Sulfur, sulphur
We Indians face this problems alot while on call with Americans..coz we r kind of influenced with Brits coz they ruled us for quite sometime, so while on call we have to spell things.. & we always juggle between Brit & American accent 😂
There's a Your Mum joke here waiting to happen
That "everybody hates Chris" Brought back memories from when I used to watch that show 😂
this guy should've been an english teacher
And they say before: "You don't have to get it right, all you have to do is participate."
Wait y'all wrap ya sandwiches?
I'm an Indian and spell 'aluminum' correct. What does that mean ?🤷
me: tin foil :)
Wtf just say foil
Even we don't know but we hate it too
But that's literally how it's spelled go to the world dictionary
My American friends always make fun of my british accent and repeat what I say constantly, they always ask me to say “Bottle of water” and then continue to say bri’ish. 🙁🙁
Dutch is Aluminium
In german its also Aluminium(folie) but we mostly say Alufolie when we are talking about the stuff to wrap the bread (alu foil)
Aluminium... the keyboard says it's not wrong.. But it also recommends aluminum-   Just look for the definition without the i
So in german...
Ok now I'm confused
"You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches in."  Me: how do you spell foil wrong?
You should read the disappearing spoon, it has the answer. Basically some scientist spelt it wrong and instead of going back and fixing all the times he spelled it wrong he just published it an everyone went along with it.
I mean, in German it's still Aluminium
Teacher: it's alimunom!   Me: wtf, bro are U DUMB IT'S ALUMINUM 👎💩
ALUMINUM?!?!? Wasn’t it aluminium?!?!?!
They also said that it's imposter when it's clearly impostor
His beard tho😂
In germany its correct🥺
India and UK have a lot in common like pronounction wise and some names of places and things for example petrol station
I thought it was plastic🤣
Aluminium?
On France we said aluminium
It would probably make sense if it was Canada since aluminum in French is aluminium
Seaking french, it's written ALUMINIUM. So ALUMINIUM is the roght answer for me😊
This just further confirms for me that being British is a speech impediment
I said tin coz tinfoil
In Spanish we call it  'Aluminio' that's why to me it makes more sense that in English we say Aluminium, but Aluminum is also correct in many countries tho.
Tin?
In portuguese it is "alumínio" so I was very confused xD
Aluminum Aluminium-
well this was confusing bc in greek we say aluminio
So i know how that feels
Im kinda brithish
I'm from Germany and agree with the British.
ITS ALUMINIUM IN ALL EUROPE SAY IT CORRECTLY AND I THINK AMERICAN ACCENT IS BETTER

Both are correct
Mericas....
Why is no one talking about the end
The everybody hates Kris sound made me feel nostalgia
@Jony Ive
americans :- Aluminium actually :- Aluminum me :- Ailuvurmum

It was orginally Alumium, then changed to Aliminum, and then changed a third time to Aluminium. This is why we use Symbols. If you say Al, everyone knows what you're going on about.

Ik, it's so weird
Wait... what?
We’re just different

Aluminium actually comes from Germany, or so, at least that would make sense because it's spelled the same.
I say a combination of the 2
I'll just speak Russian: алюминий.  Because I am from Russia and yes, the periodic table was Russian.  P. S.  Dmitri Mendeleev--scientist, chemist, geologist, meteorologist, etc.
Because we as Americans are lazy and try to make everything easier.
Meanwhile here in India we use British English so it's aluminium
I’m AMERICAN and I have no idea
Good thing in my country it's called alumin...
You use it to wrap your sandwiches Me: BREAD!!
British struggles 😔 But seriously tho, Americans messing with English and then saying we’re wrong irritates the hell out of me I would shout at that teacher and finally give him an education
That teacher is a bit racist
Deadass
Nah, it’s the other way around, and that’s because the US is powerful.
I love in Canada (both Canada and the States uses aluminum) but i thought aluminium in my head
They’re both spelled correct and pronounced correctly
Aluminium in Brazil is right It translate to Alumínio, with extra "i"
one time I was talking to my friend on discord and I said something about aluminum and she was like “ah yes, aluminum”
Breh when i just watched this short i just got so confused bc im from Poland and yeah in my land its " Aluminium " also " Aluminum " sounds like chemical element idk why.
I say both
You think Americans say / spell it like that? Then you haven't seen how we Germans do it
Aluminium is more strange to me...
Ur lucky My country Latvia🇱🇻 In there its Alumīnijs  Like what
British people spell it strangely wym??
I’m from Canada and we say Aluminium. Well, I speak French so y’a. It’s aluminium in French also here
I haven’t memorized the periodic table of elements, but as soon as I saw that the teacher was asking about an element, I knew what was coming.   I believe it is aluminum.
I’m live in Australia and I’ve been saying aluminium most of my life.
wait so is it really not spelled aluminium in the us?? bc thats how ive been spelling it😭
I pronounce it as alumininium.
In Spanish is similar to The wrong way (aluminium) because is "Aluminio" instead of "Alumino"
Legends: don't understand it😂😂
guy: Aluminum other guy: Aluminum me, an intellectual: Aluminio
Thanks for ruining my day :)
Errr It is Aluminium right? I’m in UK so makes sense if it’s wrong
All my life I thought it was Aluminum
Because, whoever created English was one something-
Aluminum is spelled like it’s said here, like in england
Aluminium is actually from Indonesian language
I really don't like spelling that word with an extra I and I don't think aluminum with two I's  exist🤥
Im American and I find this almost true
Brings back dark memories where I actually got the answer right but the teacher is uses American English •-•
Wood fixes everything
My american friends say that like only half of the things that have “Aluminium” in them spell it wrong as “Aluminum”.  So even they don’t follow that. Lmao
It is aluminium. Aluminum came from a dictionary typo.
I thought it was "alum minum" it mean haven't drink in english,and alum is in malay brunei word,not in malay malaysia word
Lol I went to spell it out & my predictive text has both Aluminum & Aluminium
The extra i is add in like every language and is pretty common
He did better than me
its just aliminyum for me xd
I thing indian accent says "aluminium".
Just say grey funny paper to wrap some foods
Indonesian have the weirder misspelling: alumunium (and I'm used to this T_T)
uh-loo-min-uhm  aluminum why do you think it’s spelled weird?
"You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches" Me: Seran Wrap?
Fuck you language.
Too easy
I used to spell it aliminium   Us Asians are weird, my mom spelt it like that too, my dad, uncle, etc
Just say that how we spell it in Britain
Why does the teacher look so tall
The look at the end looked like snoop dogg
In french it's Aluminium. Not a single american will say shit about my comment because im a canadian from Quebec and the Quebec we have the most complex french.
I dont know, theyre weird man
My name is chris and these a show name everyone hates chris:)
Me who is Brazilian: *Confused screaming*
It's funny because on the periodic table it's spelt Aluminium...
Wait wha

"I'll give you a hint - it's used to wrap sandwiches" Me : A.....wrapper...?

I thought it was aluminium and I'm American, am I dumb??? 🥺
I like how in Italian we say alluminio(we changed the Latin word too and added i lol)
The Americans are the ones that need help. It's fricking aluminium, not the lazy version XD
*Lithum Sodum Potassum Barum Magnesum Calcum Titanum* _coming soon!_
In Germany it is "Aluminium"
Yeah, I prefer saying it the original English way and not saying it the americanized way and I'm American
I didn't know Americans said it so weird I have said it like the guy in red my whole life
We Ethiopians spell it as almunium
WHY DO AMERICANS SPELL COLOUR LIKE THIS COLOR
Yeah Aluminum, Uranum, magnesum, Sodum, Pottasum, are all great metals.
aluminum: for british people aluminium: for american people if you didn’t know
*Can we appreciate these awesome shorts*?❤️
So i have an american accent but brought up in a british curriculum school ... 🤦‍♀️
I am Irish and call it both
I would've been like "write it down"
Who’s wrapping sandwiches in aluminum foil? I’ve always used Saran Wrap or ziplocks.
Literally me:plastic
Thầy giáo đẹp trai
Because after the independence of our country from yours we didn't want anything to do with your country? That sounds correct and it also makes sense
I’m American but I try to spell it like aluminium because it’s more fun to say
The brits named it the americans used it then Brits changed it . Kinda like soccer,  an english invented word Americans use UK changed to football.  More UK hoo haa
You mean British spell the word so weirdly
This is so annoying!!!!😩
TOO EASY
your poppy dumby
guys its aluminum
The ten Commandments: Will you go to heaven after you die? "For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10). You have to face the Holy God on judgment day. He sees lust as adultery (Matt 5:28) and hatred as murder ( 1 John 3:15). Will you be guilty? Jesus took your punishment on the cross, and rose again, defeating death, to save you from Hell. Repent (Luke 13:5) and trust in him today. " For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"((John 3:16).)
Meanwhile swedes with aliminium
In Germany it's alumin i ium
Are you sure that they spell it weirdly cuz im my country its spelled the same
Personally i use tin foil or cling film
In my language it's spelt aluminium so I had no idea
I don't know our speech is a dumpster fire 😀
Americans be like: 🥔minum      In my country potato is called Aloo😂
Are u uwauwawuwa?
I WOULD HAVE SAID CLING FILM 😭
Well the element song already has it in my head
A lot of countries use Aluminium because it follows the other elements ending with “ium” and they didn’t like having a random element that didn’t conform with the standard naming practices.
Its spelled aluminium in British English i think
IDK!!
why do you say it so weirdly??? just stop judging us but you don’t think about you accent at all so just stop making these types of videos
Why do Americans do this
Nope we’re just British
I blame ole timey taxes
it was an American dude who discovered and named it
You could said aluminium foil but mainly aluminum.
Aluminium fits if it was a scientific name
Iam Indian and I follow British English but I swear I never some words of American English
The British guy!
When aluminium was first discoverd, it was first known as "Aluminum" but after a quite, people started sayin " Aluminium"
I say Aluminium too and Im puerto rican… idk if my peers boricuas says aluminum or aluminium like me
No...! Aluminium is right
maybe british people are spelling it weird 🤨
It's exclusively the US and it's not just aluminium. They decide they have to have a special version of English and the rest of the world has to deal with it .
Ethan =Me in class
I will admit the English language is definitely one of the most confusing languages
He got it correct, and I thought it was aluminium but it sounds like aluminum
In Poland its actually aluminium XD
😂😂😂
I thought it was bread 👁👄👁
Americans spell Aluminium "aluminum"? 🤡
"I'll give you a hint, you use it to wrap your sandwiches"  Me: what- um.... bread??
Ok
Because for some reason we wanted to be the weird one.
Why do brits spell this word so strangely?
alumiNUM alumiNIUM the pronunciation matches the spelling
But seriously why do they say Titanium, calcium but then Aluminum? Really frustrates me.
American English is just a degenerated version of English because lack of education back in the days
Yes, aluminium because we English invented the language
Americanism what you gon do?
Just go ahead and try pronuoning worchestershire sauce. No balls
American words are very strange  Sorry Americans
We could talk about how Americans say it properly.......but I'd much rather like to talk to the folks wrapping their sandwich in aluminum foil lol
Yes Americans always spell weird
Was my whole life a joke?
Not the every body hates chris
I would say that it's spelled strangely, just different
Nah, he just spelled it german
Why do brittish people spell it so weird? The americans did a great job because in a lot of other country’s like the netherlands it’s: aluminium
Amelinum
No it's bread
Its definitely aluminium
Him: Aluminium  Me (Chemistry student): Plastic 💀
I mean. You colonised them and made them get rid of the natives soooo... You get what you effin deserve.
Fuck the uk accent
Im american and say aluminium
"I'll give you a hint,you use it to wrap your sandwich"  I wrap my sandwiches with titanium.
"I'll give you a hint, It wraps around sandwiches "  Me:Bread?   Teacher:*shakes head*
It probably merged with Spanish, we call aluminum "aluminio"
They r two different things
Aluminum is safe, Aluminium, not so much...
Aluminium is Aluminum but German it’s literally the same thing
Aluminium is how it spelt it in my language tho-
Ummmm, Americans spell it aluminum that’s normal
I am American and I had no idea other countries pronounce it differently!
In french we say aluminium
I don't know
I could never understand how the English were so bad at English. 😂😂 😂
Foiled again.
I’m American and I wonder why all the time everything is spelled so wierd
I said bread
I think you kinda look like Snoop Dog at the end lol
I expected someone to say bread 💀
Yeah I was thinking cellophane when sandwiches were mentioned because who TF wraps their sandwiches in aluminum?  It might still keep the moisture in, but that's an unnecessary increase of sharp edges and the energy to recycle aluminum probably does as much harm as the plastic bag ever did.  Sometimes I like to package my sandwiches in paper though just because it gives the paper and the sandwich this unique smell that only really pops up when you have both of them together. must be the yeast or something.
Actually it was the british who spelled it as Aluminum first.
It went from Aluminum to Aluminium to Aluminum (again) . But TBH I prefer the Aluminum cause it sounds better as an element like magnesium and potassium.
It's not.. paper?..
Idk and idk and idk and 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
no cuz before he said aluminum i thought it was gonna be cellophane or somethin
The British pronunciation of it seems Arabic so much, literally the same
So true
,,eh”
Its the same in german so aluminum is worng
"i'll give you a hint, you use it to wrap your sandwich"  Me: PLASTIC!
When i moved to American school
The name "aluminum" came before it was switched to "aluminium"
My name is Ethan
At least he offered for help... ... ....           ...
The everbody hates chris
by my portuguese way, aluminium seems more easy to speak
Me being in Australia, I can personally relate to this. Clue: you use it to wrap Ur sandwiches. Me: plastic
Aluminum on top
I smiled after I heard everybody hates Chris it was my favourite old show
It was an error apparently and they never fixed it 😂
I learnt today that aluminium doesn't have an extra i   Darn!! I did it again
Plastic?
Me cling film haha
Also every American guy in a British Spelling Bee.
America is weird
We say Tin Foil or Foil.
Cause their from  a whole different country
In russia its actually aluminium
alumninum
Repeat after me Americans, A-LU-MI-NI-UM
Because our accents are different
Or is ethan the American one
I'm English and I say and spell it aluminium
Never knew I was wrong, i speak spanish and its written like "aluminio"
Tin Foil
I just said foil
"it wraps sandwich" Me - cheese
I call it almuniyam.
I was like what Saran Wrap isn’t an element
He got it right
Aluminum???????????????????????? 👁👄👁
"Capitalism"
Fun Fact: i speak German and in German it's actually called Aluminium lol
And in Poland we have ✨AMELINIUM✨ aluminium is for loser's hahah
In Germany it is Aluminium too
Алюминиум
Why do American's spell so funny
"It's made made of aluminum, whatever that is." - Orangutan
It's because  they put more emphasis on the I
But everyone else says Aluminium
When impasta in sauce
It’s the french influence for the American pronunciation !
Because its a different language
"You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches."  Me: Plastic?
I’ve started trying to be nice about dialect differences since a conversation with a friend like this: “I wouldn’t’ve done that” “Wooden? The fuck?” “Huh?” “What was the second word?” “Wouldn’t’ve?” “I don’t like that that exists.” “Whomst’d’ve” “I will strangle you.”
U are a perfect actor dude your acting skills is really underrated..
Ale Amerykanie mają problem xD, z polskim takich problemów nie ma
I love Sodium and chlorine and Aluminum also.😅😅😅
americans cant spell
You use it to wrap you sandwich.  Me thinking oF Uranium But I know that Uranium is not 13
It's because ads on newspapers charged by the letter...so people cut letters to save money....became so frequent that us Americans took it to be how it's spelt
Americans also call solder from a soldering iron 'sodder'
So India follows british english
Aluminium is also the french spelling
Everybody hates Chris
I was confused bc I only knew the German spelling. In German it actually is spelled Aluminium xD
Uh well there are both British English and American English, I honestly people spelt “Theater” like “theatre” but I guess not
Even tho the originator named it aluminum
Americans and Canadians only say aluminum.....Rest of the world call it aluminium
The person who discovered aluminum changed the named to aluminium before introducing it to Great Britain
One of the many reasons I'll never be an exchange student there
According to my grade ten science teacher, aluminum was the original name for the element, however Britain said "no it has to sound like the others, we are ending it with ium." But you know, I'm not sure which is correct, but as a Canadian I'm sticking with aluminum.
In Hungary we say it AND spell it the same way. Aluminium 🇭🇺
At least in Brazil we say alumínio (a-l-u-m-í-n-i-o) thats right,we don't need the last m
Americans just wanna mould everything to be as easy as they want. Thank god Harry potter was set in Europe .
Me In My New Orleans Southern American Accent   “ Ferl “ 😂😂😂
Plastic wrap?
"I'll give you a hint, you use it to wrap your sandwich"  Me: ZipLoc Bag
The red guy was actually right. Welcome to the german language.
As an Arabic, we say it like the first one.
Is it not aluminum
The modern distinction between these two terms is clear: aluminum is correct in American English, as well as Canadian English, while aluminium is correct in British English, as well as most other forms of English. -Google
Cling wrap
Him: "Aluminium" Other guy: "Aluminum"  Me an intellectual: "Alumium"
Comes from the German Aluminium
in Portuguese we say "alumíníû"
Why did England mix three languages together in a strange way
I like my Aluminum as my Sodum Chlorde and Magnesum Sulfde
"I'll give you a hint, you use it to wrap your sandwiches"  Me: Bread... Wait no
This is so bad please stop!!!
You use it to wrap your sandwich. Me: paper napkins, ziplock bags, plastic bags.
Simple, just don't be British
We Indonesians say and spell it "Aluminium" like the British. How again is it Aluminum in America?😂
You know how those Americans call Aurum? You gonna laugh: Gold.
When both sides bitch about this, just tell them you'll compromise and call it by its original name, "alumium."
Maybe you say it weird
That's what I was wondering why do Americans use aluminum instead of aluminium
I’m so smart the second he said you probably use it to wrap your sandwiches I immediately thought: “saran wrap?”
Him:you use it to wrap sandwiches My dumb brain: ✨foil✨ 👁️👄👁️
He is definitely in a US classroom
"There is British English and then there are mistakes" - The Queen
Aluminium is the element Aluminum is the product after processing Aluminium.
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson America? It’s Aluminium, it’s not everyone else doing it wrong it’s you aluminium bitches. While we are at it it’s nuclear not nucular
Exactly, though I'm not British, I come from a country that speaks British English and when I moved to Canada imagine how shocked I was when I heard my science teacher pronouncing it like that and when I called it aluminium,  she CORRECTED ME! I was like WHAT THE HELL IS EVEN THAT!?!?!
I say aluminum
Bc the person that created the language was jealous of everyone
German: aluminium
I love the every body hates Chris theme
Bro we just say it differently you did not have to make a whole video about it it is literally a one letter difference like that really matters.
Ive nevrr wrapped or eaten a sandwich so that hiny would be so useless for me 💀
I said baguette cuz i'm french and he said "we use it to wrap sandwiches" :(  (Baguette should be an élément tho)
LMAO in spanish is “Aluminio”
Plot twist he’s just french
Wait till you hear an indian saying it like 'almunium'
In spanish it's aluminio anyways
Listen I don't know man, we are very weird.
Ngl when he said wrap sandwiches, I thought he meant bread.
I'm american and I can say and spell Aluminum correct. And all my teachers, parents, and friends can to. I think that's just you bud
Oh my god this so relatable (not british btw)
Yo why do Brithains spells this word so weird
Ok
And un the UK  we still laugh at Americans over this
I almost die of laugh at the end hearing the sound of the tv show of Everybody Hates Chris from the comediant Chris Rock very good!
I pronounce and spell it aluminium and my phone always tries to correct me and all of my teachers and it pisses me off
Nah British are actually saying it right but the  Americans are saying nonsense
Because Americans wants everything specialise to suit them. Sheesh, miles, pound, fahrenheit, aluminum defuqqqq.
Pfff, they spell natruim as sodium
It is aluminium. You changed it to aluminum cause you have spelling problems.
United States school is a mistake if they teach this kind of nonsense.
I personally love Aluminium as much as I love ferrium, cuprium, argentium, and platinium
I am American and I can say all these correctly and spell. I am smarter than the Americans in these skits
I dont understand the people who say it that way
Answer is “subway wrapper”
Aluminum
Let's ask Jerome.
why do yall say Al 'E' minum
Ketika Alucard Minum:
English language comes from England.so British English must be the correct English 😃😃
I wrap sandwiches with plastic
In German is also Aluminium.  This comment is DEUTSCHES STAATSGEBIET!
Looks like Captain Rasta of Supa Strikas
The real question is why do Brits add so many superfluous letters to words?
I'm American and all my British friends call it aluminum they said they do not like calling it aluminium
The american spelling is the correct one. They made an agreement to use aluminum here in Europe if the Americans used Wolfram as standard instead of Tungsten.
I would just show them
In portuguese its alumínio. Close to aluminium
the place I buy it from use newspaper
i also hate "aluminium" i'm pretty sure i'm american though
Nah why do y’all have to add extra letters
Translate intellectual into Turkish and you'll see a similar thing
the UK spelling is actually wrong technically. (look up the history) it makes sense why they made the spelling change. doesn't make it right tho.
Hey Chewkz are you the Hacker from leverage
Foiled again...
Quick answer : Cause not everybody speaks English and it spells different in different languages?
Cellophane
wait....13th element AaahHhh *Wire....*
Me: Tin … … FUCK
the american way is the correct way
It’s like with the word Color. It can also be spelt Colour, but there’s no real right way to spell it
Bro "Aluminum" is literally spelled the way you say it
Ohh dis Afro-accent
“…wrap your sandwiches…” So, not Saranium?”
So where's he answer to "WHY?"?
Koreans call it 알루미늄, which sounds like this: AL-LOO-MEE-NYOOM
Wait... THE FIRST ONE IS WRONG????
Meanwhile in Indonesia: Alumunium 😗
Why?  Idk public schools I guess lol
Now I know why I picked business over chemistry, because my first thought was  plastic wrap.
Plutonium, titanium, lithium, americium, californium, then suddenly alumiNUM.. Just why....
Hahajajahaaaa
AlumiNUM sounds really retarded. No other element ends like that. Imagine if it was like plutoNUM, EinsteiNUM fuck off
TIN FOIL
Americans broke english to be different and make words easier but it's wrong to the entire world.
There was a typo when the discovery was shipped to the US, missed the I and it stuck
First Guy: Aluminium Second Guy: Aluminum Legend: Amelinium
This happened on jeopardy
Sorry, but you, sir, looks like Snoop Dogg
Lol they do pronounce like that?
In portuguese is "alumínio". I would never know it has no 'i' in english
It's Aluminium for those who are confused now 😅
Both are correct... US pple are full of themselves..
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic  number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals, at approximately one third that of steel. It has a great affinity towards  oxygen, and forms a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, non-magnetic and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al; this isotope is very common, making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the Universe.
English suz
Only in the US, everywhere else it's aluminium
Canadians pronounce it as aluminum as well. The British chemist Sir Humphrey Davis,  the guy who is commonly credited for naming the element after theorizing how it would be isolated, also called it aluminum. Not saying this the only way of saying the element, but it certainly is a valid one
We call it tin foil 😂
Please do mountain
Becuse when they printed newspapers they took letters out to save on money and it just stuck
Amelinium
Why'd Americans remove the extra I for ?
When he said ethan instead of pronouncing it as 'efan'
Not realistic. The teachers shirt wasn’t awkwardly tucked in with part of the back sticking out.
It's "Aluminium". Whoever says something different uses the word wrong.
i even heard aluminium somewhere, not aluminum or alumunium
i wrap my sandwich in plastic which isnt good
We spell it with I in German
So we have enough time to make more sandwiches
Imagine being British (love the videos keep it up :) )
I have no idea why some people say this, I don’t Americans say that and Im not sure if any specific group says it
Aluminum was later changed to aluminium to make it fit into the periodic table more harmoniously.
Bro there is no wrong way to spell a word and if there is it’s the one with extra unnecessary syllables 😂
Had the same issue with “mom” and “mum”
Hey I’m an American why y’all British spell it so strange?
Fun Fact, the word "Aluminum" actually started in Britain and eventually switched to what we have today. (Don't recall the why) So 'technically' we Americans are using 'proper' English
Him: why do Americans spell it weird. Me: why do the British spell and say it weird
What’s the 6th
A-lu-mi-num
Don’t y’all spell saber like sabre
That's honestly happened to me before no joke
I have literally never heard someone say "aluminium" in person.
Here in America most of us don’t know how to spell a lot of words and even more often don’t know the main differences between slang in different English speaking places.
Aluminum is easier to say I still the the short thougn
We say aluminium in 🇳🇱
Even in french we say aluminium
Fuck the American spelling... follow international standards ALUMINIUM
I DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE ALPHABET. I JUST TALK. SO SHUT UP ABOUT THE ALPHABET, AND JUST TALK.
We spell it aluminium in israel as well
Americans use the old spelling
Its not Americans who spell it weirdly, its British who does it
in my country it actually is spelled aluminium, so i have written it right all along
Tin foil
It litteraly is spelt like it sounds
Spell it right*
It makes more sense with no extra i
ah yes the typical american teacher that doesnt know anything outside of america
In Swedish it *is* spelled and prenounced aluminium!
My dumbass said "bread?"
It’s saranwrapium
Aluminum is like the child’s aluminium   Reminds me of how I used to say critical as crikital as a kid, so basically Americans are all small children who can’t speak English
In germany we also say Aluminium
That word is cursed with mandela effect.
Wait. American here. It's not spelled aluminium over here? I've never seen it spelled aluminum
We don't like to add, or well should I say I don't like extra letters in words that don't need it like armor, color, and of course aluminum. And isn't Aluminium like a different element, if not then I'm a fucking idiot but still.
We spell it that way because 'aluminum' was the original spelling assigned by it's discoverer...
My dumb self proudly answered his question about that thing we use to wrap our sandwiches:  TISSUE  😂
We spell it like how it sounds lol
The look at the camera got me lol
I love learning about regional dialects. There’s just something so interesting about “Wait, you’re telling me that if I were to say Howdy to you (from Oklahoma), you would associate it with How Do You Do???”
Americans and their desire to always be special
MERICA FUCK YEAH
British people add to much shit to there words even simple weods like color they spell colour like who TF says it like that unironicly
Paper towelium?
I learned something new today
And they say boddl o wader and British say bow o woa
Well it is just their accent
"You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches"  Me: ZIP LOCK BAG
This is how I freaking failed a Chem exam
In Spanish is similar at how is said by "the first guy"  (Aluminio). Pd: Sory for my English
Aluminium is just wrong..
In England we actually use Lead
Because that's how we say in FRENCH
Is that why they pronounce it wrong?? Cuz they leave out the i???
*pronounce
They are two different metals but I get confused sometimes too aluminium and aluminum
That's not an extra 'i' that's REAL (British) English that Americans corrupted.
I pronounce it like the teacher and spell it aluminium I am weird like that
“Why do Americans spell things so weirdly”  One sec let me go check the moon for any other flags
here in arabic we say it with i
comes from latin. aluminium respects more the origin. sorry.
I say both
We don't do that.
ALOOOOOMINUM
Aluminium foil was invented in the US as we know it today, and was invented in my home town of New Kensington, Pennsylvania by the Alcoa company.  Also, one of the more efficient ways to process it was discovered in Pittsburgh in the late 1800s on Smallman Street. That in turn created Alcoa, which is one of the largest Aluminium producers in the world. The US never discovered it, but did upgrade the processing quite a bit, and also made it possible to wrap your sandwiches and make fancy conspiracy hats.
Just as we spell it in Germany, Aluminium
The Boy just spells in German. Mister professor not good in this language I guess.
If you are in us or canada then you better say aluminum if you are not then aluminium is always welcome
American be like: Bike = Bike  Nike = Nikeeeeeee
....and as usual the rest of the world says aluminium....
"see me after class you'll need some extra help" "unfortunately sir I'm just british"
Im from another country that aluminum was aluminium XD
It’s not our fault we’re British
My question to you is why do British spell alumi(num) so complicated
Actually they are both correct. Look up the history of the stuff.
I say it the American way in Australia, it annoys all my friends, but hey most of the content I consume is American
I actualky know the reason for this  Newspapers used to charge by the letter so a lot of letters got removed examples: Color aluminum favor favorite lots of U's got dropped
man's got that L4D1 Drip
I mean it's honestly the same thing all because someone said it different don't mean it's wrong
its not aluminum its aluminium
wolfram
Besides, aluminum’s word origin came from the ancient Latina language.
It’s because Americans do not have a Latin background. While England does have it, because the Roman Empire conquered britain in the year 47 AD.
Es divertido que "aluminum" en español es "aluminio"
aluminium is german spelling
I use something that is transparent(i forgor the name 💀)
Cling film
In Italian it’s ALLUMINIO, so here in Italy it’s right
never got why they did that
Doesn't need the extra I
There’s actually a reason why, news editors used short abbreviations of words to save an extra buck. Each letter on the print costed so the shorter versions have been adopted by lazy Americans. Which I am one of by the way.
Nah nah nah. This one is actually verified to not be "aluminium" anymore. It was changed to "aluminum"
In Italian we have the extra "i", it's "alluminio"
Me: plastic
I hate American spelling in general😭
No one: Me: F O I L
In spanish is "Aluminio", there's an i anteriores the n
It's actually pronounced correctly the American way; however, due to the British scientific community not being please with breaking tradition of rhyming old Latin words (Barium, Magnesium, etc.) the pronunciation was altered in Europe to maintain the rhyme. the Moe you know!
In German there is an extra I
Aren't those two different elements?
Foil
The funny thing about this one is it was called Aluminum first, and then the extra "i" was added by some people so that it looked the same as other elements
Science leaves the chat
Cuz I'm not in America so it is aluminium for me cuz of yk helium, lithium, magnesium, sodium, berryllium etc
This legit never happens nor happened
which is the american spelling actually 😅
The fact that both of them could just spell aluminum off the top of their head is more impressive
In spanish its "aluminio" too with extra i
Simple explanation is printing! I think it had to do with industrialization or capitalism? It's because of pricing and ink. It was expensive to print so space was limited. Editors (or somebody) would find letters "not needed" in words and remove them. It became the norm, so people went along with it in printing (obviously to this day)
Everyone : aluminum / aluminium  Me : alumUnium
Time to play my favourite Metal song.    … That is to say a song about my favourite metal.  Aluminum.  Doo doooo, di doo doo.  Aluminum.  Dooo doo doo dooo. Aluminum.  Doo doooo, di doo doo. Di doo doo. Di doo doo doo doo dooo,  di doo doo, doo.
Americans have it pushed into their cranums from birth.
ngl i thought it’s bread
the what the what, in spanish its the same "aluminium" well close to it, Aluminio
I'm deeeeead
aluminum aluminum
Still funny how it was a spelling mistake by Webster.
"You use it to wrap your sandwitches" Me: BREAD
Well, it's because of France.
Now spell the colour grey.
Don't worry bro in Australia we say the same way you do
Its the same thing though
I say aluminum but my parents say aluminium
british boy gonna cry? Go shungite in tour pants doo
.... you're gonna laugh. But this is the real answer.   Capitalism.  No im not kidding.  Back in the day people saved money on advertisements by removing letters they thought redundant.
Wasnt because the newspaper use to cost per letter? Thats why a lot of words are different on the USA or i am wrong?
Is that like the United Kingdom language?
He just started speaking latin out of nowhere
I call it elfoil
Capitalism
... no, we dont pronounce it like that
Makes me wanna eat sodium
So remember kids don't be Bri ish
I have the power of not being either british or American and therefore pick and choose how I spell stuff, in usually spell colour like so and aluminium like so cause muscle memory
Does it really matter ?
Screw up generations
We spell it how it sounds lol
We did it to annoy british folks and it just stuck. Lol but really tho, americans had the printing press right, and print cost ran for a PREMIUM back then, so we started cutting out extra letters like colour became color and all that. All of that just stuck over time and became widely reguarded as the regular over here.
Exactly Americans spell it wrongly
Laughs in Portuguese: kkkkkk  Laughs in Spanish: jajajajaja
Not the only ethan
When your british
Rlx in Brazil you'll be correct
In polish its actually spelled aluminium
Alll i can hear is: that's what i said *sodium chloride*
Or just "Alu"
This is why kids take appointments in ammunition stores
Personally I use that plastic wrap stuff
Eh, I prefer using mercury.
We say it the correct way
Aluminium is an alloy lmao
That's ravver schtewpid innit bruv
Ifl
We spell it aluminum? Wtf
Actually in spanish it's "aluminio" so... "Aluminium" sounds better to me, "Aluminum" sounds like a little kid is trying to say it
Americans say it the og way >:)
I'm pretty sure its because when America was told about it, the text they were given spelled it "aluminum", so its a little dumb, but not *that* dumb
Fun fact. Aluminum was discovered and named Aluminum. Some Brit came and saw it, thought it wasn’t pretty enough and called it aluminium. The us was like naw fam so they changed it back to aluminum
When your from the uk but you moved to America and went to school
Why do British spell things so wrongly?
Aluminium
It’s official certain Americans can’t tell the difference between British pronunciations to their own
The real question is. Who wraps their sandwich in aluminum?
Why do British spell words strsngley xD
I would've said tin foil 😂
It's actually both.
Americans write “interesting”, but say “inner-resting”
Aluminium just sounds plain wrong.
That’s how they spell?
Aluminum was how England was going to change the word. The the change made it to America way back when England still had a part of it. Then Britain decided to change it back to Aluminium. Then Aluminum stayed in America.
English in America is confusing ,I live in America but Spanish is my first language.
Bruuuuuh
Real talk, the "You use this to wrap sandwiches" hint made me feel like I was being taught by a cool teacher for a second. Nice feeling.
Based aluminium with aluminum pronunciation
The reason we took some letters out of words is because of newspapers. Back then, it cost per letter to post an article in the paper, so they removed what they to be arbitrary letters
I don't know why we say it like that we're just dumbasses
THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT WHEN HE SAID YOU PROBABLY USE THIS TO WRAP YOUR SANDWICHES WAS SARAN WRAP LMAO  THEN I WAS LIKE IS SARAN AN ELEMENT
Actually, like the "u" in honor, colour and the like, the Queen English did the adding. Following the source, for honour and color, in these cases French, they are spelled the "American" way. Although rubbish should go into the trash 😉
French is better on this word lmao
I honestly hate everything about the us
Alluminum is a strange pronunciation
Americans...
Do you say data or data?
Gotta agree with the British here
I spell it alu-mini-yum
Hint: “You probably use it to wrap your sandwiches”  Me: Search the compound made up paper.
They spell it incorrectly, just like they allow Google to redefine certain words to make them racist.
Here in Canada, it’s interchangeable
Brits don’t know how to speak lol
You are aware aluminium and aluminum are different things
Ethan is the 2nd element.
"...to wrap your sandwich."  Me: Uh... Plastic?
I’m American, but I have never heard it with two Is
Is aluminum not the worldwide? IDK and im legit curious. I live in America (R. I. P. me) and dont know
In Russia it's Aluminium. Or aluminii.
I love the subtle spelling differences between different types of English, changing the pronunciation, and I also love how I've never seen an American complain about the UK spelling
Well in spanish is aluminio
Same reason we spell color like “color” not “colour”   The printing companies used to charge for every letters  So it’s cheaper to take out letters
They spell it wrong in the USA because of the newspaper. Back in the day, they wanted to cut printing costs and make printing faster (back when they hand printed) so they decided to cut out letters of some words. Some of them were aluminium, colour, flavour and favourite. Of course, there are more but I can't be bothered listing them all here. Little history lesson for you. :)
Hahahaha I learned how to cut vocals too!!
I have had this problem with my American friends on xbox
Aluminum titanium
The original word was "alumium" but Davy, the guy who invented the word changed it to "aluminum" then the Brits said that change didnt fit in with "sodium" and "potassium" so they changed it again to "aluminium."
If I remember correctly the reason some American words have some missing letters is because old Newspaper manufacturers paid by the letter so people started getting rid of some letters. So yeah it’s because of capitalism.
It's actually called that in American because of a typo
You say Zed so no right to talk
me saying aluminuminumium
Because Americans spell it the way the man who discovered it spelled it.
Why do Brits hate the letter zee or zed?
when you get beat by a bunch of dirty peasants, you don't get to say how to spell shit
The reason Americans spell it aluminum is because that follows the pattern that many other metal set preiously. Some examples of this are Titania and Titanium, Mangesia and Magnesium, not a metal but silica and silicon, urania and uranium, ect. This was an existing established pattern so when it was found that a metal could be extracted from alumina it was called aluminum. This meant that scientific books in America were published calling it aluminum. This issue is that around this time in britan they changed the name because they thought aluminium sounded better.
Fuck you it’s the right way to say it
I always used to say aluminium before aluminum
My first language isn't English and I remember there was an I in aluminium. But some places don't put that so I used to think I know it wrong and then when I'd see the spelling with I again and question what I knew before
Well in Latin it's aluminium so who do you think is wrong this time?
✝️Please Pray and Repent to God Before its to late, God bless :D
I had to learn all the elements to understand this video
We got cough and tough, like who the heck made English so confusing. 🤣😂
i agree that it's said/spelt weirdly there BUT if you're going to live there you need to study the accents and the spellings, i don't study spanish only to miss accents on the spellings and pronounce hola (hoe-la)
Aluminiuminuminum
I'm indian but i still pronounce it as aluminium-
My life was a whole lie 😂
Because America literally fucks everything up.
Just say aluminimuminum always works haha
They are two different elements
I guess we don't need that extra I
It’s different bc the original word sounds weird and 5 syllables in 1 word is entirely too many
I prefer aluminium. It is more similar to Spanish.
Plastic
Because yes
As a American I don’t know anyone who has spelled it Aluminum
We don't spell thing weird Neither do Brits
Also arabic says it aluminium
Umm so idk if it's the same thing but ING Greek it's spelled "αλουμίνιο" (aluminio) so yeah idk coz most English words come from Greek 🤷
Om offended *-*
I'm American and I spell it aluminium
Why does somewhere with more people spell a word differently well idk why do you spell it differently im not even American yet I don’t spell it like that the uk is smaller so they be the weird ones
I live in italy, and even we here add the I in Aluminum.
From German Aluminium🤣🤣🤣🤣
There are two things Americans get right that the UK gets wrong: Which side of the road to drive on, and how to pronounce aluminum
Aluminium is the what the world uses folks, except North America that is.
In german there is an extra i
As a German Aluminium sounds just fine^^
The British Chemist who discovered the element called it Aluminum, not Aluminium. Aluminum is the proper name.
It's because of americanization. The differences between British and american english are only because of capitalism.  It cost less to print words with one or two letters omitted, and while per word it's not much but for a whole paper it saved on ink and money.
pretty unrealistic of the teacher not to know both spellings
American english is dumb 🥱
Wolfram bitches
Tbh thought it was going to be tin, for tin foil.  Either way, I say it both ways.  Depends on how posh I'm feeling that day.
Aluminum was before aluminium.
Actually the US is right on this one. Aluminum came before Aluminium but the UK and the rest of the world started using Aluminium after.
British “people” stay losing
"Ill give you a clue you probably use this to wrap your sandwiches" Me - cling wrap...
Bruh americans be like: alooominum, like wtf dude it isnt some gohst or something
I was gonna say Tin, like Tin Foil 😭
It's actually because when the element was originally discovered, it was misprinted in American newspapers and said "Aluminum" and not "Aluminium"
Why do people care so much how another country spells a word? Does it really hurt you?
Who TF wraps their sandwich in aluminum?
The reason is actully cause news papers made you pay per letter so people shortened the words
Meanwhile poland: GLIN
=_= Americans can be so confusing sometimes 'This post made by England gang'
To think the English used aluminum first then call us different for using a word they made.
North Mexican English
so does he have a british accent or not? am i the only one who’s confused
As an American I find this funny
This is me when I moved to the America
... bread?
Not strangely fucking wrong everyone else in the world spells it right
😂😂😂😂🤣
And there's me who pronounce it as alumunium
We spell it like that to be more unique. Similar to how we use feet, inches, yards, miles, etc. to measure distance
Americans and the bri’ish have different pronunciations of words
Only the og’s remember the song at the end😎
Ice cream just stands for weed
I'll never stop getting onto Brits about this
Lol I thought aluminium too and when the other dude said aluminum and he got it right i was like 🤨
Aluminium just SOUNDS BETTA
I’m born in America and I don’t pronounce it like that. Guess I’m not American
It’s Aluminium! There’s of course an extra “i”… Maybe any famous scientist committed a mistake and everybody imitated it.
The real crime here is wrapping a sandwich with aluminum
British people: "why do Americans call the lighty switch flippy offy a lightswitch?"
I thought it was tin foil
I thought he was gonna say a woman
Tin
Easy british people pronounce it with an i infront of the um in aluminum and americans dont so the british just put an extra i because Bc that how they say it
I mean then theres color and colour...... And we spell things weird?
We actually spell it like this because of the economy! Newspapers used to charge by the letter, so we used to remove letters we didn’t need to be able to read, it’s like this for words like color too :)
I'm American and even I say aluminium, even my phone tries to correct me
David?
This is crazy😂 it's Aluminium, what the hell is Aluminum
We germans say Aluminium.
A quote from Zach Hadel “WHO FUCKING FOUND IT IT WAS US!! IT WAS US!! FUCKING SAY IT OUR WAY!!”
That’s how it’s spelled and pronounced in Germany,so don’t give up
Iif it's not weird, then most likely isn't American
it is aluminum as named by the guy who named it. thank you goodbye
I didn't know they actually made a word to match their mispronounciation😂
Bruh
Me, an American don't even understand that.
Say it with me A l u m I n u m
Just salty we Americans have a superior way of saying words
Thats anoing
The reason Americans spell this word and many others wrong is cause dis country's language is fucked up
Why do brits spell this word so weird 🤨 actually you know who we can all agree that the GERMANS spell words weird 😂   (I'm obviously kidding 🤪)
I like how America just throws itself at the top of the world, even with simple stuff like spelling and pronunciation.
Do Americans just remix words😂😂😂
I might have an answer: back when the United States was starting to to become its own country the British had a tax on everything especially on newspaper prints with every letter being printed had a tax, so to sort of combat it the Americans removed any letters they seemed that were useless explaining why we spell some words differently and have different pronunciations and entirely new words  Edits: I just remembered while writing this everyone was taught this in elementary
I think it was to save money because when they would print newspaper, they were charged so much by the letter, so they took off un necessary ones. That's what I heard.
American seem to say it like French.
uh the british obv say it wrong because if you read the spelling they british say aluminium not aluminum which is the proper spelling
People only say Aluminium because they can't pronounce Aluminum
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium  ah-ehm...
The American way is better aluminium sounds hella lame
Paper?
Aluminum is actually the original spelling and pronunciation. Aluminium was adapted later.
It’s actually kind of long winded but basically from what I gather there was three different ways to say aluminium the original no one uses anymore. Aluminium that is Brits use is the second variant and the final way the Americans say it was the last way the scientist who discovered it uses to say it to simplify it. Might be missing a lot of detail here though
❤🙂🇬🇧 I was gonna say we in the UK are right,  how many other elements end with -UM. I forgot about tantalum. ☹
Tf I didn't know it's ALUMINUM in American  I am from india and we follow British English 🤷
Thx for saving my grades in chemistry
We don’t spell it weird. Other countries just add letters to words for no reason.
In german there actually is a second 'i' making it "Aluminium"
Ethan is the type of guy that eats a lot of Sodum - I mean Natrum.
Copum
Yes we also love using Uranum in our powerplants
Tech specks fact
Ok at least no water joke, same joke will make you boring
that's what you get for speaking british, lmao
Americans spell it strangely because of capitalism, the spellings of most words were changed to be longer so that newspaper companies would be charged more as there were more letters in the words.
I mean… he be looking like the black version of Walter White😂
Aluminium is correct at in brazil. You are strangers =-= aluminum
Why do you need the extra "i"
Facts: Americans & Canadians spell and pronounce the name _aluminum_ while the British & most the rest of the world use the spelling and pronunciation of _aluminium_
Aluminum is actually the original way to say and spell it. It is proven some british dude spelt it the other way because he just wanted it to sound “fancier”
I mean... We call those flying robots in the air aeroplanes.
In Poland, it's commonly referred to as "aluminium", but the scientific name used only in science is "glin" I have no idea why but it sure is dumb as hell.
Better question, why do you add unneccesary 'e's every chance you get, for example, "Olde"
Why did I think bread 🤔
WAIT SO IT'S NOT ALUMINIUM ???? CAUSE IN FRENCH ITS ALUMINIUM ??????
America for life bush!!!!!!
I say it as the British say it, and I’m American. I have never heard anyone pronounce it as Al-oo-min-ee-um
Why does the UK pronounce it so strangely
Intellectuals: “It’s alumium.”
It's not are fault that you speak wrong
There is English then there is mistakes
It might be aluminum in American English, but it's aluminium in actual English
We invented the language, they butchered it
No the 13 element is mayonnaise.
why does people do this???? people understand what u are saying but pretend they don't just because you pronouced that wrong. i rlly hate it...
I honestly don’t even think Americans say it like that but maybe they do in in different parts.
To be fair I woulda said plastic
Actinium, americium, berkelium, beryllium, cadmium, calcium, californium, cerium, caesium, chromium, dysprosium, einstienium, erbium, europium, francium, gadolinium, gallium, germanium, hafnium, indium, lithium, lutetium, magnesium, neodymium, neptunium, niobium, osmium, palladium, plutonium, polonium, praseodymium, promethium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, rhodium, rubidium, ruthenium,  samarium, scandium, selenium, sodium, strontium, technetium, tellurium, thallium, thorium, thulium, titanium, uranium, vanadium, ytterbium, yttrium, zirconium.  Yet the americans can't be bothered to put in the letter I into aluminium.
In portuguese is "alumínio" so this makes sense to me
He would have lost in THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE!!!
I totally didn't say plastic, no sir, I did not.
A-l-u-m-I-n-u-m
I’ve been saying it that way all my life
LMAOOO
This some weak shit man
HAH  I'm Italian and I spell it  A L L U M I N I O  WE HAVE THE EXTRA I.
In French we spell it "aluminium" so he is not so wrong
True I say just metal sheet haha
I live internationally and have ended up more than my fair share of accent arguments. Ze-bra all the way!
We spell like English people
Because the person discovered it wrote it both ways
Bruh Americans REALLY do be saying aLuMiNuM??? WHERE is the I??
Ooooo something I know, okay so Americans spell words with less letters like, colour to color, because in the time of the printing press the technician had to place each letter individually in the machine. So they consequently charged by the letter, so many started to drop the letters in words to save on money.
why British people spell and pronounce stuff wierd. ex tire, zebra
Idk why do we
also featured: helum, titanum, plutonum
Americans spell things differently because it cuts down on the numbers of characters while typing. Cause it used to cost a lot of money for reporters to go over the number of words/characters so they came up with ways to shorten spelling, acronyms, and abbreviations.
The long and short of it back in he day printing presses charged by the latter and so some "unnecessary" letters were removed from words and over time we just adapted to spelling words like that.
I'm actually an American and even I think it's weird
When you are so dope and call it "Glin" instead. No one of you motherquackers will pronounce it correctly, unless you speak this language haha. 😎
It’s always the different skin tone people
British people are so bad at everything
Alimoniham
Aluminium
Who originated that word?
Aluminium is just Aluminum in french, just for you to know
Thats actually more cringe than an American bitching over brit english. Like damn lol
Aluminum and aluminium are the same some dude just changed it in America cuz he didn't like the way it was spelled
the teacher be color blind
In turkish we say like aluminyum like aluminium
Every instinct in my body just went into attack mod because this is just accurate.
The reason some words are spelled differently is because newspaper ads were payed by the letter. So sometimes they would drop letters to make it cheaper.  TLDR : the US spells things different cause capitalism.
british people stay taking L's. And yes, I refuse to capitalize the b.
Honestly I have no idea myself :|
In german it's Aluminium
So, it is correct to say aluminium, right?
i’m american and i don’t even know the answer to that i fr thought there was an extra I
I always pronounced it like "Aluminum" And everyone around me pronounced it as "Aluminium" They kept saying I was wrong and I was like "Bro there is no extra i" I got to fed up and stopped saying aluminum altogether until one day someone that me and my family knew(they were an expert in English and teached English in a college) said it like "Aluminum" After that everyone respected me as if I was a genius. True story
How us British people say the word: Every boday
"you use it to wrap a sandwich" Me living in Philippines: a paper bag? plastic? What?
The answer is rope
Brits. The simple minded.
We write words like this because news papers would cut down on letters to save money on ink and forever changed our dictionary
Never heard an american or canadian say it like that and ive lived in both countrys this is bri'ish propaganda
Well in German it's Aluminium
Aluminum omg auto correct too OP
Because there american
In Germany its called Aluminium ha
I swear this is a British thing
The element is called aluminium. Everything else is just wrong. Every scientific paper uses an extra i, too. People that call it aluminum also use the emperial system which should disqualify them anyways.
Dunno why but sand paper was the first thing that comes to mind
Dunno why but sand paper was the first thing that comes to mind
Historically speaking, if I’m not wrong, the British spelling is right.  Edit: In most cases I am correct, however I have looked through other comments and found out that the British spelling is, in this case, “wrong”. Therefore this is one of the scarce words in which the British spelling was NOT the original.
What I think is if you said aluminium it sounds weird with foil. Aluminum foil sounds more normal I guess idk
I experienced this in an American school. I spent my whole life till that point learning British English 😂
All metals end with -ium, including iron, gold, silver, tin, lead, manganese, copper,  cobalt, lanthanum, molybdenum, zinc, tungsten, and probably a few more I forgot.
Why's everyone stressing over which one is correct, they both mean the same thing lmao
For the same reason we don’t say ‘theatre’ or ‘colour.’ Same reason we don’t say ‘God’ and ‘guard’ the same.
British "people" making up funny words
But why the hell did I think saram wrap.
I'm not sure If this is actually why, but if I had to take a guess I'd say capitalism
Btw the whole reason it has different names is that the French dude who "discovered" aluminum renamed it a bunch of times
This is how I spell and say it also I use paper
The U.S's version of English is just different for the sake of being different, it's just dumb.
I started to notice there are things in french and British in common like Aluminium it’s also close to the pronounciation
DEUTSCHLAND HAT WAS ZU SAGEN UND DAS IST: same
I dont know its America
"Everybody hates chris" 😍😍😍😍
This is actually one thing Americans get correct. Y’all have it twisted
I got it right
It's like we arent the UK or something....
Alyoyminiuhm
In my class we weren't like this we all tried to understand this one British kid even when he got it wrong till he got jumped in class for smacking someone and calling him a muppet or something
I am not going to lie. As a kid I thought aluminium and aluminum were different metals. Why do Americans have to make shit so difficult?
This is hilarious
In spanish is "aluminio" so maybe thats why idk
please why did my dumbass say plastic💀💀💀
It's actually the early foundings of "Americans" whom changed spellings for the vast cultural differences.  Isn't that mad? 😂
It’s because the Americans and the French both independently invented aluminum and the British copied the French
Litteraly Google it Americans say it correctly
Im english class on a test i lost a point couse i wrote mom instead of mum couse for some reason in my school only british english is accepted
as a non-native english speaker, I never understood this lol
Really threw me when he said the 1st answer was wrong cause that's what I said. I am from England though
I thought it was plastic wrap
The IUPAC says its aluminium, but the US didn't catch on so, they included aluminum as an alternative spelling, both considered correct.
Because america is weird and changed so much stuff without reason
first thing my mind went to when he said we speed this weird was Bologna...
_Idk but _*_I starts to sing Vitas-The 13th Element_*_ when he asked that question._
Sodium or as it is known in Europe, Natrium
This guy will be my new teacher
The reason why everything is spelled weird in America, is originally so that we could cut back the cost of printing. That's why we got rid of so many u's and other various small ones. So the reason there is so much debate between us and uk is because the us is cheap.
As an Indian who watches a lot of Hollywood, I had to change my writing from aluminum to aluminium to avoid spelling mistakes. I used to think I probably misheard or misread it somewhere 😂
Also there is the whole lorem ipsum thing with fake Latin in potassium and sodium
Aluminum Aluminium They're the same only North Americans say Aluminum
They could make the same video about the British way of spelling it
Sodum, Lithum, magnesum, calcum, thorum, uranum, Helum, Beryllum, Potassum, Chromum.... Thanks USA
Cause there dum trying to make words up that already existe
That's like the one word that gives it away when I'm pretending I'm British
my question is why bri'ish can't spell the t and the dammed r in any sentences! or even better bri'is can't even spell can't right like wth is up with you guys wanting to say can't as it's written down and other strange things? they make no sense and just makes your English barely understandable especially for foreigners   bw I'm Hungarian so lol
No
Aluminium also in german, the guy discovering it gave it 3 possible names alumium, aluminum and Aluminium
Be like: mufka, your language is CALLED ENGLISH, not murican.  your variant is the progeny,  if anything your ass should be dragged into detention! 🤣🤣🤣
It's because Americans wanted to erase as much influence as the British had on us. Other examples of this are Colour = Color, Flavour = flavor, ext.
Because in spanish it is Aluminio
The reason why Americans are so different is cause there a completely different breed
Next level, Driver's license. Are we ready. Yes, so am I driving this Hyundai? You failed. What? You said the car name wrong. You're not worth to drive it.
The correct way was the first said way
Aluminium is actually more right, more similar to latin original, nice bs dude
It’s less that we spell it weird, and more that we spell it correctly
I know this cuz I'm a nerd but the 13th element is  boron and it's elemental letter is B
I'm actually surprised I knew what the 13th element was even tho I don't even wrap my sandwiches
The real question is who the fuck wraps their sandwiches in aluminum foil?
Actually the British are the strange ones. It was originally aluminum and the brits changed the end to make it more in line with other elements ending in -ium
As a non native English speaker: Why the heck do we need to learn so many different accents in school?! (Literally British, American, Indian,  African, Scottish and Australian)
Aluminium is the german word
Amelinium
I swear if my teacher wouldve done that to someone in my class they wouldve been slapped, ALL OF US ARE DIFFRENT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAY IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Aluminium actually sounds better since it come from the Greek word Aluminio
Oh, in French it's actually "aluminium"
Ok I love this guy but for all the clowns in comments saying English people always pronounce stuff wrong, remember the letter t doesn’t exist with the British accent
Excuse me, the person that discovered the element named it aluminum. So we don't spell or say it weirdly, you guys do.
Yessir definitely no extra i
In macedonia we spell it like this  Алуминиум or Aluminium
I spell it aluminium but the I is silent
I personally love aluminum as much as I love titanum and magnesum
Alu minion
It's probably because there's lots of mixing with Castillan (Spanish) going on there, and we say it like "aluminio"
Aloooomenum  Alyewminiyum
I actually have the answer to the spelling issue. The piece of paper on which the word “aluminium” got inked in order to standardize the spelling got smudged, causing it to look like it was spelled “aluminum”.
American:-aluminum British:-aluminium Indian:-alumunium
If a word was invented in America, it’s wrong. Simple.
The reason American spelling has missing letters compared to British English is because when the colonies were being set up telegrams were widely used. But you had to pay for each letter, so they dropped a bunch out of words that could stil be understood. Like colour and neighbour, the Aluminium vs aluminum one always bothered me though.
This actually happened to me when I moved to the us
Or why do Britain's say it weird...
But When I told my teacher it was Aluminum she told me wrong.😅
Teacher: "ok who can do the 7th element?"  Me: "haha ha haha ha haha ha hahahaaaaaa pllllllllllllllllll hahaha"
I counted in my head to get to aluminium, but I should've realized what element it would be once I saw who it was.
We just wanted to be different. America is that pick me girl
I stopped questioning the English language because the more I looked into it the more stupid it became to me.
British people suffer (REAL) (NOT CLICKBAIT)
Thank you
How did I know the answer before the answer came out but I didn’t even learn that thing yet?!
It’s cuz a lot of English words stem from French and other Germanic languages, but mostly French , look it up, aluminium is the way you write it in French. My guess is people ended up mixing the 2 ways over time, ending up with this frenglish mix of a word lol
Also hate the "You have a British Accent." Just hate yo hear that 🙂.
There is no extra 👀
We spell it both ways
Me: plastic wrap
"I'll give you a hint, it wraps around sandwiches"  Me: Plastic wrap?
I know how you feel
Cause the extra letters are fuckin useless
Fun fact the reason americans take I and U out of many words is because it saved ink when printing news paper back in the day
Hmm... Aluminum?? WTF? BREAD wraps my sandwich usually...
It's another case of "We don't spell it wrong, you do.
I once had an argument with my friend who believed that aluminum was spelled iluminum
You’re the ones who spell it weirdly
Considering that most element name ends in -ium. Its very logical to say Aluminium instead of Aluminum. But since most of the textbooks are written by American authors, Aluminum became the more common term. Even us Filipinos learn it as Aluminum
I'm not a fan of the argument aluminium versus aluminum. for the sole reason that aluminum, is just a more processed version of aluminium. Aluminium however is a raw material.
Most other elements end with "ium" and other languages call it aluminium. This is clearly just Americans misunderstanding and then pretending everyone else is wrong
You use it tomwrap.your samdwich Me: ziploc bags?
I've always spelled Aluminium that way, and I'm American
In Poland we say amelinium
Because when type writers were common and you had to pay someone to write a letter for you they would charge per letter typed so in order to make it cost less they would cut out letters
It was originally called aluminum its kind of like the product name so everyone then tweaked that name to make it follow element naming conventions hence the ium, and similar practices in other languages... But Americans kept aluminum
You wanna know because they want to change the English language and then say we get it wrong and we can’t speak our own language
Idk man- I’m American and even I don’t know
EVERYBODY HATES CHRISSSS
In the dutch language it is Aluminium So he was correct
i always been confused by it being said "aluminium"
In Germany we say *"Alu"* 🤣
alUminum sounds better Than alumInium
newspapers used to charge by the letter, so they dropped extra letters in words because capitalism
I said plastic
At least where I live in the U.S. it is aluminum, and pronounce just like you do in the U.K. so I was very confused when I saw this video
Because America is weird
Metal elements is spelled with ium right?
I feel this
**IM GONNA NEED YOU TO SAY ZEBRA PLEASE** 🦓🦓🦓🦓 🤍🤍🤍
"Ha, jokes on you, it's spelt aluminium in the periodic table" lol
Then there's me alumium
Very true actually
Englands
Now I am confused that it is aluminium or aluminum🤔🤔
The guy in red looks like snoop
Aluminum sounds stupid as hell
I British and i do understand this😭💔😂
Americans can pronouns English words too well, just be patient with them
Funfact: in German it’s pronounced and spelled Aluminium ;)
Because the think they are special and need to be different
Honestly it pribably was America thar changed it
Meanwhile here in France  :  Aluminium
American spellings always seem to be a lazier version of British spelling.
Well, we spell it so "strangely", because of our accents and culture
They will use anything but the metric system
Bruh why do YOU guys spell it weirdly?
America moment
I'll give you a hint, it wraps your sandwich Asian Me : Rice!
I'm lucky I have an amazing science teacher because he doesn't count spelling because he himself is terrible at spellint.
Even in the USA, officially it's aluminium. We are just so used to aluminum though it seems.
I remember I said aluminium in 5th grade and the teacher looked at me weird, it wasnt until 7th grade that I knew
We all know its aluminuminum
Because after the revolution we took the English language for our selves.
It's - why do you pronounce it so incorrectly
One word, lieutenant
But we say aloo min umm
Nah its Aluminum the guy who named it spelt it that way and pronounced it the 'American way'. Because other countries are too stuck up to admit that America is always right.
In Sweden is it 3 i
Aluminium was discovered by a Danish scientist and in Denmark they call it aluminium so surely they should get the say
Has to be the dumbest spelling. All the other elements are ium
Aluminium is the correct spelling.
Na you weird
Because merica
The majority of the world says Aluminium, not this American BS I have a question... for USA...  *WHY?*
PLASTIC
Americans being special as usual
Yes I know us Americans have very very weird spelling
Because it sounds American
Yeahr I'm bri'ish, 'owd you know
Am I the only one who said cling film?
Well in french its Aluminium so maybe we influenced english lmao
Bro everybody hates Chris 🤣
Yeah
The original name was apparently alumium and then it was named aluminium by some and then the guy who came up with the original name just wrote a book with it spelled aluminum but only America and Canada use that spelling the rest of the English speakers of the world use aluminium
American says boho o water hahahahha bless you guys
Even as a UK student, it does make a little more sense to name it aluminum (because it reflect light therefore making it easier to remember)   But aluminium sounds cooler
Aluminum was first but aluminium is sexier and more widely used today.
I’ve never heard it that way and I’m American ?
You spelled Americans wrong. It's actually spelled B-R-I-T-I-S-H
I acknowledge aluminum is the correct way but I say aluminum
America: aluminum Literally the rest of the world + my autocorrect : aluminium
Why did my mind shout clingfilm 🤣
Chewx: "man, why you all spell aluminium so weirdly" Me: "gee, I don't know, I mean, it's so simple, why don't all the countries spell it that way?  Oh wait, not every country has the same freaking LANGUAGE, but pffft, Americans can't actually have a different set of words than the U.K after all, every person there came from the U.K" Angry immigrants would like to know your location P.S Please don't take this seriously, it's a joke.
Same reason they call Wolfram tungsten, same reason they raped the words diameter, kilometer, perimeter etcetera. Too lazy to learn how to properly pronounce it
The difference between aluminium and aluminum is actually the way and which it is processed from The bauxite ore.
I said selophaine….
R3t4rd teacher
So next question what is the 7th element
I'll tell you why because they doesn't want to show the people that they got these words from Arabic
I'm American and I've never called Aluminum that, is that an accent thing, a southern thing? I really want to know who says that cause I am curious and in general confused.
I was like Paper. And where does paper be in the chart 😅
I knew,y'all watch this 2 times or more.
Why does it matter how you pronounce Aluminum when you know what they mean anyways
It's was actually an old newspaper trick the American people(could be different people too) used to use. Because they were charged per letter they cut down on letters they felt unnecessary. Colour-color. Favourite-favorite. Aluminium-aluminum. Also could be wrong but I have a strong memory of this.
Every single country in the world that uses something related to latin: Aluminium Americans: Aluminum
It’s a country. We have our own accent and you guys do too. I hate brits for so many things
no its woman 😡
Help me out with this, is it grey or gray?
In my country we use both...
The title lol. I could say the same thing about u. You guys spell Tyre like this lol
The actual reason why Americans spell words differently then the  British and Canada. 2 reasons first the war and then the printing press. 1 they are completely different, when America fought for there freedom they fought for the distance and differences between the two countries. They changed the English language with pronunciation and then over time it turned to written words after paper presses started becomes a useful means of communication. 2 News companies and writers would use these machines and get charged per letter. A simple way to save money is cut out useless letters. Hence why a lot of words are missing letters like “colour” and “color” or even how you pronounce the letter “Z”
Why do brits say “bruv” and “mum” when neither brother or mother have a U in them?
Wait until you hear how they spell kalium and natrium.
You guys wrap your sandwiches with aluminum? Or wrap it at all?  And ive never heard someone pronounce alimunum "aluminium"
I guess it’s true. Everybody hates Chris.
This reminds me of when my mom and dad would fight cuz my mom would say at the Scottish way and my dad would say at the Brooklyn way and it  was always. good. TV.
Wait.. wasnt it aluminium?
It’s also aluminium in Germany.  Don’t know why Americans need to spell everything wrong.
Aluminio
In arabic it is said aluminium
>Be British >See the Danes discover Aluminum >Spell it with extra "I" >Claim everyone else is wrong
*Ahem*  I believe you mean correctly.
In Germany we say "Aluminium" which is written the same way like you see here but it's pronounced a bit different
Aluminium (X) Aluminum (X) Alumunium (√)
Aluminium is the correct wording and spelling for the word too, but Americans screwed it over
I pronounce it as aluMiniUm like you
Because in German it is spelled Aluminium
Cause Americans have to be different.
Say thank you in my country we say alominum
"I'll give you a hint, it wraps around a sandwich" Me: plastic?
I… don’t think I’ve ever wrapped a sandwich in aluminum…
its aluminium its international standart
In Arabic language we spell it like American " Aluminium "
We don’t. You do.
if you named plutonium with i than what the fuck are you saying aluminum
In French it's spelled aluminium
didnt even get it wrong       im an aussie btw
Why do they spell Flavor/Color like Colour/Flavour......or Favourite
Based America-centric professor
Because it's broken English.
Lol
And I say it almooniam in India 😶
I don’t think I’ve ever seen it spelt that way and I live in America
"I'll give you a clue, you probably use this to wrap your sandwitches"  Me, an intellectual: *my hands* 😳
Fun fact: Literally no one does this
I don’t get it either and I’m American
I had a British friend once. He worked with me and I’m from Alabama. He said that about aluminum and I fucking died
Imagine saying Aluminum
In France we do say aluminium, with the second i.
Why do British spell the word so Stange
The reason Americans spell that way is because of printing companies. They would charge by the letter which meant people would dropped a lot of letters that were seen as unneeded like the u in colour This was done so frequently that overtime this spelling just became the accepted norm.  Edit However as @Kario pointed out to me the American selling of aluminium is closer to the original and was even considered the correct one for a good amount of time
The way the british say it is the right way
Aluminuminum
Lmao yes cause neighb-our,  theatr-ey, metr-ey, axe, and so many more make sense. Atleast we spell every day words like how it sounds. Neighbor, theater, meter, ax, etc.
I didn’t know that
I say Aluminium
Whatever it’s called tin foil
Just make a show called, “Americans and there shit education system.”
Depends on who named it. Did we name it or the Europeans?  Edit: The guy who named it originally named it aluminum, but some people started pronouncing differently which became the excepted name of it in European places. And like all other things, Europeans try to say we're wrong.
I had an argument with my friend about this, cause we live in america and he randomly started calling it aluminium. I asked him why he was saying it like thay and he said cause thats how its spelled, like wtf you talkin bout? This aint England! We got guns here.
Technically the spelling for aluminum came first
You spell it wrong do you not
them british niggas crazy, he said "𝒶𝓁𝓊𝓂𝒾𝓃𝒾𝓊𝓂"
Aluminum was first the only reason it was changed was because aluminium sounded fancier…
As an American in a British school, I suffered this a lot
Peanut Buttah
I used to say like this...aaaluminiyam 😂😂😂
repent and believe in Christ
Dam everybody hates Chris more like everybody hates Oliver 😂
Both spellings and pronunciations are correct
The guy that discovered the metal called it aluminum. Other scientists wanted it to sound more Latin, so they called it aluminium. He was outnumbered, so they won the fight for common usage.
People pronounce it as aluminium?    Lmfao i am american and pronounce it as aluminum
Imagine the shock people in the 16-1700s would have now if they realized that them being super extra with their words would actually carry over to today with the silly ass names some of these restaurants and children have. If the E is silent, then why does your child have four of them?
The US is young, it's still in its rebellious teen phase.
Answer me this question  What other country says illuminum instead of aluminium
To be fair in Portuguese it's "Alumínio" and have an I right there
Personally I think aluminium sounds cooler then aluminum. But I’m Canadian so I Pronounce it as aluminum
Aluminum sounds cooler tho
Its aluminium lol
Leeloo Dallas mutipass
The British pronunciation tho sounds so much cooler and better. And I’m an American btw
"I'll give you a hint it wraps sandwiches" Me- Foil
Just stop being British
The guy who theorized it eventually decided on aluminum. It was Sir Humphrey Davy by the way. He name a lot of elements most of the first and second column.
well language probably tends to rapidly change when speakers of it are separated by an ocean for several hundred years
It's been proven that the British pronunciation is actually wrong and that the American pronounciation is actually correct look it up
It’s spelled both ways apparently
Please get over it. Yes americans and British people do things slightly differently. Content about something else please this is stale
The original name is Aluminum. The brits wanted it to be “Aluminium” because it sounded more “classical” and more “latin” (🙄). IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) standardized the spelling “Aluminium”, but that’s not surprising as most of the countries affiliated with it preferred that spelling to begin with.   Essentially, a guy from the US named it Aluminum and the pompous brits decided that wasn’t good enough and changed the spelling. Its rich that they’d want to add a letter to a word considering they don’t even pronounce half the letters in a given word per their accent. Bo’oh oh wo’ah.
Who the fuck spells it like that
Pretty sure it actually IS pronounced 'all-you-minium'.
We spell it correctly, it's you who spells it incorrectly
The teacher dosent even know approximately all metals have ium as their suffix
It’s aluminum
In indonesia we say aluminium too
Funny that it's accepted to be spelled either way. It baffles me
We also call it Aluminium in French. US always has to make everything about themselves... Miles, yards, Fahrenheit etc...
It is spelt exactly how it is pronounced
Idk
Okay but why did I say cellophane so confidently to myself 🤦🏻‍♀️
Trust me, the british version is correct. I know this cause I was a blacksmith; the person who discovered it was a brit.
Tin Foil
I mean yeah cause English is the language  that makes sense outside of America stop acting like we don't have silent letters or weird words america just created more lol
There's more Americans than Brits. By rule of consensus you are outnumbered.
He still says "somefing" while doing the American accent
im american and I say it "Aluminum"
To je amelinium
The same retards that use imperial also can't pronounce aluminium correctly
Aluminum sounds so retarded to me, everybody else calls it aluminium, why do Americans call it aluminum
Because they are americans, they even use eagle wings and hamburger weight instead of meters and kilogrammes
Saran wrap
i hate british people
It is because we are sane
Every foreign person’s way of speaking english sounds ridiculous😏.
What the hell is wrong with americans? They can't say anything right
You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches  My dumbass: Hands?!
Even Autocorrect thinks its Aluminum and not Aluminium
In Poland we say glin
I’m French it’s aluminium, in German it’s aluminium, in Spanish Portuguese and Italian it’s aluminio, even in Norwegian it’s aluminium  Chris is right 😌
Dont wanna be the annoying one who cant take a joke but by law you cant say some1 was wrong as a teacher in scholl because he said it in american english instead of english
In spanish it is Aluminio, not Alumino, so there could be something influencing students.
I had a huge smile on my face after hearing that “Everybody hates Chris” clip from my old favorite show
Bc they Americans
it sounds so fuckin silly the way brits say it
fun fact this is one of the rare cases where the american spelling is actually the more proper and original. it was only changed later to aluminium for the purposes of standardization, which US has a habit of not giving a damn about.
WE don't spell it wrong, yall do!
Also Deutscher ist Aluminium auch vertrauter
A loo min um, u Americans and ur words
Because of the german residents who brung that over to the americans
In german it actually is "Aluminium"
WOW AMERICA GREAT JOB 👍 👏
It’s spelled that because it was too expensive to print “extra” letters.
We spell it the same way in germany like the americans
IIRC the americans cut off alot of Letters back in the past at some point, to save money when printing their newspaper and stuff, because less Letters, the less Hardware and ink needed.  E.g. colour = color
“Aluminum” is in fact the original popularized spelling. The guy that invented it was suck an indecisive quack though that he changed it like 3 times before that and then it got settled on “aluminium” after it had already been widely accepted as aluminum in the states, so there was no changing it for us.
“aluminium” is how the kid who says “present” instead of “here” says it
I mean, in German it's Aluminium as well.
Well you say Americans spell it bad but you call a sweater a jumper your not jumping into a sweater...
Hah, in Russia we say aluminium (алюминий) and its not wrong pronunciation :)
The element is a bo'owo'oh
Colour headass😂😂
Rest of the world spells in aluminum tho
Again americans stating something without any scientific reason and saying it is the correct way... Like feet, inch, yard, miles... Whatever...
Me, who guessed “Plastic”: 👁👄👁
It's aluminium. End of discussion
Why do Brits spell this word strangely?
granted, this is the same as asking why we pronounce z as zed and not zee, its different for different dialects
The reason why so many letters are removed from (american) English words because printing companies were trying to save money when making newspapers
In french it would have been good 👍
If people will talk English they should speak the normal English as the one they use in England since that is where it was first made
Clear  wrap was  my guess it must be a hist thing where he's from me cuz I can't think of too many people that uses aluminum
Oh wtf I actually guessed it lol
Like everyone my brother me my teacher my class mates. Say it Aluminium
Americans should have there own language not English as they butcher the language so badly!
Because we're lazy
its like that because of a marketing campaign where the printers making flyers to advertise aluminum foil made a typo by leaving off the second i
Aluminium
Sir Humphrey Davey named it alumium then changed it to aluminum. Yes the american spelling.
I’m American. I spell it properly     Aluminium. It is the original way of spelling it.
A lot of words were shortened in America because the paper used to charge by the letter.
who wraps sandwiches with aluminum?!?! if you don’t use saran wrap you 50 years behind modern man
Okay so, when the American version of english was made, Merriam Webster wanted 2 things. 1, that American english should be different, distinctly different, even if only slightly, from british english. And 2, spelling should be more streamlined and easier to do.   He removed alot of the fluff. And ever since, Americans, such as myself, have been spelling things more simply, and therefore also pronouncing things more simply. You could call it a more refined and practical version of english. While British english still retains flairs of it's ancient origins.  Therefore, making British English a more fanciful way of saying, or writing things.  Essentially: British English maintains a fancy, or elegant tone. Or maybe you'd say poetic tone.  While American English is streamlined, and simplified. A much easier tone to handle. And therefore theoretically, an easier one to learn, and perhaps write.  If you want to know more, i recommend watching a channel by the name of, "Name Explain." They've got tons of videos on the differences between American English and British English.
Sorry. Our country is better. Your english is the wrong english now. Should’ve stayed a good empire nerds
Its pronounced both ways....
Its america , you cant expect anything from them
For the same reason you keep using imperial system 🤣
Don't worry I am also saying the same thing ALUMINIUM
Both aluminum and aluminium are right.
They’re spelled that because printing charged by the letter. It was done to cut down on printing costs.
Aluminium is the international way of spelling it and saying it, america is the one that says that.
I’d use seran a rap I can’t spell
Because one of their presidents sucked at spelling so did the American thing and changed how the spelling of the words legally
Exactlyyy. I was wondering if Aluminum was an alloy of Aluminium or something but it turned out to be just the strange way Americans have changed the English language
Aluminum sounds better. Us OT
I was thinking "saran wrap' lmao
Alu mili yum 😂
Bit**
The reason why Americans spelled things shorter than British people is because in the old days of newspaper printing every single letter cost money. American English was essentially streamlined in order to save money on ink
My boyfriend says “mum” and “aluminum” and he’s not even British. He’s American and tries to talk British.
I learned about this last week.
Jesus who are these rich people using Aluminum tinfoil to Rapid their sandwiches
This why brits don't attend Amarican schools
Aluminum aluminium
Thats actually funny
Why was I think Wrapper? 🤣
Because some idiots working with the guy who named it decided to take out the extra I
Why do bri'ish people say colour or honour? Aluminium is just extra letters and syllables
Wrapped in aluminum? Not tin foil?
Whose gonna tell him Aluminum came first?
The guy who discovered this metal first called it alumium, then changed it to aluminum and then 5 years later changed it to aluminium, so basically Americans have been wrong the whole time except for the years between 1807 and 1812
Cringe
Why does anybody care
That’s what I call relatable-
In Germany it's Aluminium. Aluminum is a really weird spelling
i don’t understand why they say oloominum
Алюминий.
In Arabic we say aluminum
No, it’s that foreigners are fucking weird
Booring
A L U M I N I U M is right.
Aluminum I’m calling it
I mean we both have accents
The creator of aluminum was British and regularly said anyone who pronounced it aluminium is just trying ti sound smarter than they are.
Aluminium sounds more like a crystal or mineral than a metal
*Correctly (you accidentally typed "strangely")
Colour. Favourite. Mum. I get corrected online all the time with words.
Its ALUMINIUM A
its properly and originally aluminio
It’s actually “aluminium” as he said it Bc not he discoverer is danish and that’s how they say it in Denmark
Yay i got the answer right!
In spanish its “aluminio” so maybe thats why americans are so confused
Plot twist: The teacher is gay
People who say it tin foil       We are INVENATABLE
: D
It is funny that his name was ethan
That language barrier can be a pain sometimes.
What do you mean bro we spell things fire
American English is just British English simplified
Because its spelled aluminum in like.. every official dictionary and periodic table
I'm English and live in the US. I'm triggered 😂.
He's just French lmao
my ass thought saran wrap
Wait is it actually called aluminum in america and not aluminium
I have no idea what Aluminium is. It sounds like some sci-fi metal alloy with aluminum or something. Its as wrong as pronouncing Caramel as "carmal"
Alkane dust. Some say Al-kane others say al-can-e. Capri sonne. Cap-ree & Ca-pree
Aloominom
Fun fact, the reason why America spells some words differently is because the printing companies in the past didn’t have enough money, so they removed a lot of the silent letters in order to reduce printing costs.
The suffix for most elements is -ium and without the i it just sounds so wrong to me lol
That's how I pronounce it
Al mi ni yom in Persian I guess I have to start my education all over, Huh?
But Aluminium ist right
Why natrium is sodium and silicium is silicon?
That’s how the guy who invented/discovered it pronounced and spelled it, later some nobleman decided it decided sound elegant enough and somehow got everyone in the UK to pronounce it weird.
The US says aluminum because too many letters makes it hard.
If I ever hear some one say ali-mini-uhm to me with a straight face, it's on site
I always spell it aluminium the same way to spell titanium
It is spelt Aluminium for us, its only America that says Aluminum
aluminium > aluminum
Why did I say tin
US be like uranium, trinitium, moronium, and then aluminum
When I was young, I had a lot of trouble trying to say it the American way, so I had to learn the British pronunciation until my brain and tongue were able to figure out the American pronunciation.
It's the plutonum that makes the flux capacitor work
It's true even though I've never been to America Or England(any country in Europe) my english matches british english
I'm lucky I live in indonesia   💀 and I spelled it wrong bruh
So how do people in the Uk pronounce/spell Platinum? And molybdenum? Tantalum? Lanthanum?  Anyone? No? You just want to harp on about the one we say differently and ignore all the ones you apparently say “wrong” as well? Classic.
America is just different in a way that’s different
Its aluminium Wtf is alumi-num ?
We built different like color not colour aluminum like you said
the british accent developed after the americans had already revolted and become an independent country
My wife only speaks spanish and she says it like that now I am stuck saying it like that even though I spell it different
So I was right the entire TIME!
They don't spell it strangely, they spell it wrong....
A good example of American English vs British English
You want to know why? Easy. As soon as the Americans claimed independence after Spain and france drove British colonists off America they wanted their own way of talking, so they copied Britain and changed the words up so it's occasionally spelt but mostly sound different.
Man people must really dislike America. Come on Canada and the US call it Aluminum. I thought it was impossible to hate Canada
The Colour Gray
Because there's nothing minimum about aluminum.
Everybody hates Chris is goated
Well the universal name for it is aluminum
Why do British people spell it so weird?
Luckily every science teacher ive had understood they were are the same thing
Maybe I am American
Aluminium is a different metal from aluminum if you didnt know.
Just gonna say this as a American. Nobody in my life said aluminuim, they always say aluminum
ill give you a hint, its because we say it differently. we dont say aluminium, we say aluminum
Why does this guy criticism us for everything we do lmao that's essentially the reason for most wars
Shouldn’t have been british, nerd
It’s because newspapers used to pay per letter so they cut out extra letters, like the u in color or amor
aluminum ew..
why do bri'                 ish people say it so awkwardly
Only people who always went to school with lunch would figure that out
I say aluminium
Yeah aluminium sounds alot more like the latin languagues version - alumínio in portuguese. Are other latin languages similar ?
So. Americans spell it properly, & say it properly, but we're the strange ones?
He said you wrap sandwiches in it and I said bread. I'm stupid
“Umm Ethan”  Me: yEs
Reason 12 billion I want to avoid america
British
Bruh its not ALOOMINUM wtf
Well they use imperial instead of metric. That says alot
Why do black British do anything
He looks like the guy frm rush hour like a twin wtf
After the war between the saxons ans the northmans or idk a lot of french words entered the uk english language such as Aluminium
The 13th element is … THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE
Strangely? It's just missing an "i"
I tried saying it the way he said it and I couldn’t even fucking say it.
im american but i feel ya man
It was a brand of Aluminium in America, like vacuum cleaner in England is usually referred to as a hoover
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Omfg so relatable
Both aluminum and aluminium have a long history of use referring to the metallic element (commonly used as foil to cover food). ... Aluminum became preferred in the United States and Canada, while aluminium became favored throughout the rest of the English-speaking world.
I actually make this mistake a lot but thats bacause im from spain and in spanish its named "aluminio", some words like this are hard to remember. Like fabric means "tela" but "fabrica" means factory so a lot of people get it wrong.
"Color" 😐
They take either answer and either spelling. Just like grey or gray and color and colour.
Aluminium in Sweden
Pov: some international schools use British English bc american English is bad
It's aluminium y'all You can't change my mind-
My dumbass said "plastic wrap" what is wrong with me lol
That's so easy to pronounce to be honest lol just kinda confusing if you add extra words...
Fuck the US bro lmao
My country is neither us or uk but to me aluminium sound right (also more commonly used)
Aluminium is the correct one. I'm not from usa or uk, but i've never heard anyone saying aluminum
Oh boy Welcome to Germany it’s  Aluminium
we say aluminiy checkmate english speakers
Greek reference for chemistry is still a better since the first discovery in there
German Aluminium  Usa aluminum Looks terrible
Aluminium comes from the word 'αλουμίνιο' so I believe it is aluminium which is correct because it resembles the Greek word more "aluminio" "aluminium"
its actually officially spelt correct in the US because we spell sulfur with an f not a ph
In germany its named too Aluminium
Aluminum sounds so much better than aluminium
Also Russians: Alluminii
Do spelling test in Chemistry exam 🤣🤣🤣
Fun fact: it's spelt like that because when America was becoming independent they dropped letters from words to make them cheaper to print
If you can't understand both you're just being an asshole on purpose
My dumbass said phosphorus with confidence
In german it is Aluminium too
As a Filipino who uses the word Aluminum but know the existence of Aluminium, I'd slap that teacher and feed to him the knowledge that there's a country called United Kingdom.
Aluminum is correct tho!
Apparently, the original term was “alumium”, which the discoverer decided didn’t feel right for whatever reason, then opted to switch the name to “aluminum”. Then the decision was made to change it to “aluminium” to conform to standard element naming (ex. helium, potassium, sodium, etc.). I’d be willing to bet that stubborn marketing and even more stubborn people had some play in why the US decided to stick with the second term. Hell, some people here still actively disagree with the decision that pluto isn’t a planet. XD   And don’t even get me started on jam, jelly, gelatin, and jell-o differences between the US and UK. That’ll start a frenzy.
No, why do you say it Strangely?
It’s bc American newspaper company’s used to be charged by the letter so they cut off some letters and they just got absorbed into the language
Wait,, but it's literally spelt "alluminium",, you just pronounce it without the "i"
Yes there's two different ways to spell it because the person that actually created it he made two ways to say it
You spell it strangely. There is no need for the extra letters.
It's like when people spell "favorite" like "favourite"
This is the whole colour/color debate
I memorized the entire periodic table, the foil or whatever is aluminum, but the element is called aluminium Edit: even my phone marks it incorrect lmao
Who in the hell wraps their sandwhichs with that stuff? Like using it for open containers without a lid is good but who in the hell does that for sandwiches?!?!?!?! Like the force you use to press it down would squish your damn samich bruh, just use plastic wrap like everyone else...  I'm sure you sleep with the lights on and shower with the lights off as well.
Why do Brits spell:  Neighbor (neighbour), analyze (analyse), leukemia (leukaemia), estrogen (oestrogen), maneuver (manoeuver), pediatric (paediatric), etc.  So weird?
I swear English is so fucked up
I hate this bc aluminium is purely a britishism and only exists there in crazy land
No why do British say things so strangely
I loved the everybody hates Chris ending I just seen a couple eps. A few days ago too
Whats aluminum thats bullshit
The proper term: aluminium
I'm finnish, we call it Alumiini, we have never been wrong, it's alumiini.
Aluminum was a mistake that waa once made and people with their lack of education started adopting this wrong spelling of the word. Also aluminum wouldnt make sense in that pretty much all other languages still have that I in their version of the word
Americans think they're special, there is one language it's English yall just thick
This is so true with Favourite, Favorite, Colour, Color.
Dude its a Latin word Americans have a thing for fucking words up
Heyyyy
First time I heard a British man say this I thought he casted a spell
Idk anything about british pronounce but I am pretty sure it's aluminium instead of aluminum
I like the jokes about how British people say things different from Americans. Also sometimes they spell different as well
It’s not the only peculiar spelling that Americans have they dropped the U in several different words that in other English speaking countries say you were still there I will give you examples: neighbour, favourite, colour… There’s lots of examples
Idk if aluminum/aluminium falls under this but in the US people working at printing presses would start taking extra vowels out of words to make it cheaper
Ye its spelled ALUMINIUM Americans
I'm Canadian and we have a weird mix of the European and American versions of English for speaking but we are supposed to use the European Version for writing, I've always found it weird as hell.
Bruh wtf how are they saying it
Have to dumb it down
I'm french and we say " aluminium " too
Why are you guys bitching about how people pronounce stuff
I tried to pronounce it and  it I couldn’t do it as well sense I’m also British
The way Americans say it is disgusting
We don't. You do
It's the Americans that need that extra help sometimes
As a Turkish guy i spell that wrong too
I actually hate teachers like that. If the teacher knew his shit, he'd knew only north americans call it without extra i.
I’ve never heard any American say aluminium
Technically the Americans are correct because it was called Aluminum first. However the rest of the planet realised that was a stupid ass decision and elected to ignore it in favour of the standard ium suffix for elements.
Hi
So true
The IUPAC spelling is "aluminium", used internationally. The original word was actually "alumium", I seem to vaguely recall.
Aluminum 🤣🤣🤣🤣
One of the many words the us pronounce  and I cant stand it
“I just found out that Americans call a ‘rock melon’ a cantaloupe” type vibes
we're not the ones saying it wrong
🎶every body hates chris 🎶
I can't be the only one who has never seen a sandwich wrapped in aluminum.
I swear if some random American Calles aluminum aluminum i m gonna kick it's ass
It's ok you'll get used to it
Hahaha this guy obsessed other accent😅
every other country : uses metroc system to measure a hole in the ground  America : "that hole is the size of three whole washing machines"(this is real, not joking)
Idk, I’m American, though I say aluminium
Back in the day of newspaper they had save money on ink so why not shorten words by taking a couple of letters here and there
Yeah but we got 300 million ppl so…
Us Americans do not say “aluminium”
I call it almunium
It's aiilliminium not alluminum
Yet we are all different some have the most billionaires then any other country some have the most racist
Why do the British spell that word so weirdly? Smh.
Considering my country is neither us or UK yet we still say aluminium, I'll assume it's the supposedly correct one.
imagine being Brit
F*ck I need help😂😂
Pretty sure I heard somewhere the British accent wasn’t popular and was only picked up on and heavily accentuated when American English became common
Ah yes, Helum, Lithum, Berylum, Sodum, Magnesum, Potassum, Calcum, Scandum, Titanum, Vanadum, Chromum,  Gallum, Germanum, Selenum, Rubidum, Strontum, Yttrum, Zirconum, Niobum, Technetum, Ruthenum, Rhodum, Palladum, Cadmum, Indum, Tellurum, Caesum, Barum, Cerum, Neodymum, Promethum, Samarum, Europum, Gadolinum, Terbum, Dysprosum, Holmum, Erbum, Thulum, Ytterbum, Lutetum, Hafnum, Rhenum, Osmum, Iridum, Thallum, Polonum, Francum, Radum, Actinum, Thorum, Protactinum, Uranum, Neptunum, Plutonum, Americum, Curum, Berkelum, Californum, Einsteinum, Fermun, Mendelevum, Nobelum, Lawrencum, Rutherfordum, Dubnum, Seaborgum, Bohrum, Hassum, Meitnerum, Darmstadtum, Roentgenum, Copernicum, Nihonum, Flerovum, Muscovum and Livermorum. These **ALL** fit the standard set by Aluminum!
Ah the classic alumnum
I think the real question is. Why do we spell it so normally
Well technically the name of "Al" is Aluminium no matter the language, because it's the Latin origin word. Same for mercury (hg - hydrargyrum) for example. That means engl. aluminum (al - aluminium).
I get the confusion between aluminum and aluminium, but i dont understand why you guys use sodium for Na (natrium)
British tend to spell things the same as the French. Given they are ruled by a Norman, makes sense.
I just thought it was a Color vs Colour situation
Learn chemistry
Me who thought it was tin for tin foil 🙃
Alot of american woards are shortened due to news papers. At the time it costed them by the character so if you can reduce the ammount you use it saves alot.
Why does uk spell it like aluminium
How many letters does colo(u)r have
Aluminium is the french way of saying it lmao
In Poland we call it glin for some reason At least that's what our chemistry teacher wants us to call it
This can be seen through out history tho. Like Color vs Colour  I think the reason had to do with the US newspapers charging to print by the character count not word count. That’s why they dropped some letters to save money. I’m not sure how true it is but I’d love to hear what anyone else has to say
Tbf it was called alluminum by the person who discovered it
Well, probably because it was named in the United States, and the British are the one who started spelling it weird. So basically, stop stealing our things and making it worse
Well he's right about the aluminium, not aluminum
To be fair, the Uk and the Us have always had spelling conflicts. Why is there an added u to so many words when it doesn't do anything? Colour vs color is pronounced exactly alike
We also spell "Color" and "Favorite" wrong. Theres missing U's in there
It is actually called Aluminium, according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) which is responsible for naming elements and compounds..
Every body hates Chris
So I was wrong my entire life.... [*insert french tears*]
The only reason why we spell words different at least this is what I have been told was to save money putting words in the paper because each letter cost money but this was back in the 60s and such.
I heard back in the day somebody misspelled it, and it stuck since then.
The U.K and its subsidiaries such as the commonwealth, along with most of europe use Aluminium, the United states, canada, most of asia, and north Oceania, and most of africa, say "aluminum"
Yeah teachers should know about british existing
Grammer kekw 🤣
We really do I live here and I've always thought we spell things kinda weird 😆 I guess my bloodline really is from afar lol
Ya we spell a couple chemicals different
British and Americans
Aluminum became preferred in the United States and Canada, while aluminium became favored throughout the rest of the English-speaking world.
Both are fine
Omfg everybody hates Chris. That touch was great
Is it bad I was guessing tin foil
In portuguese it's almost the same as Aluminium, but without the m
It was aluminum first, british people changed it later
I know this is off topic but does anyone else ever say ch-em-i-cal and pronounce that “ch” instead of saying it like “c”
In science classes, it actually goes both ways because "aluminum" and "aluminium" is the same element.
He was right
Fact: they both are correct. Different spellings for the 2 different countries
Wait!? Its not spelled like that everywhere? Damn it America, failed me again!
tbh the british way is how my family says it in arabic
Me, an intellectual: saran wrap
They got rid of letters in some words to save money on ink when wayyy back. Capitalism.
We don't spell it strangely, we spell it just as it should be spelled.
THE EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS OUTRO LMAO
The 13th element is cling film
The guy that discovered it named it aluminum but some pretentious journalist didn't like that and called it aluminium and it just kind of stuck around. So tldr if you say aluminium you're wrong.
I was thinking Lead even though just because Pb
The American pronunciation feels unnatural and I live in the states
I hate American spellings.
You pronounce it, how you read it
This confused a lot back then
Who in tf says aluminum anywhere in the world I swear you making stuff up at this point
I'm American and I call it aluminum.. no I. Never heard of that
Wrong! It's actually millenium.
In portuguese we call it aluminio, very close to the aluminium pronunciation. And I see that a lot if not all other countries have a similar pronunciation. It wouldn't be the first time america disagreed with the rest of the world.
Americans really can't follow patterns can they?
British people say it weird
Btw Captain America's shield is made using Vibranum. But script writers were British therefore it became Vibranium.
Teacher is an idiot. Aluminium is the right answer!!! Look up latin word. Names of elements on periodic table are abrevations of latib names.
This was the day I started hating the school system.
it's sae in India some guys from our school learned from american yt people and got a -2for spelling 😂
Who tf wraps their sandwiches with aluminum foil?
in germany its actually aluminium
Why do Americans spell mum as mom
Fr tho I got confused about Aluminum lol
Omg, they also say "potassium" to natrium. So who cares about a missing i?
I feel so stupid. The first time I saw this, I genuinely said cling wrap. Fucking cling wrap. I guess the periodic table needs to be updated.
Honestly aluminum actually sounds easier
No bc the element is aluminium and the thing u use on sandwiches is aluminum (ik they're the same thing but that's always what I've been taught is they're spelled differently for some reason)
We in Sweden stole that word. Aluminum for something else. Kinda forgot what though... I am trying to forget Swedish..
Brits say it weirdly not us
The printing press or whatever
Aluminum
Let's be honest it doesn't matter who called it what first american teachers would indeed react in this way from everything i heard as if they don't know there are other englishs out there
We don't pronounce it like that we pronounce it like you did
I say Aluminum and I'm American and I've never heard it any other way
Tinfoil
it's "Aluminium" you dumbfuck
I’ve always called it the correct way, well I’m not American.
america says 32 is frozen and everywhere else says 0 is frozen. thank you america, very cool
One of my teachers got me in trouble just for this
Adding an -i- to a word doesn't make it more scientific. British people are probably trying to tell Romans that it's plumbium, not plumbum.
Aluminiam
Same reason you spell it differently, we’re different. We think it’s weird they way you spell it, you think it’s weird the way we spell it. Just like how a tiny piece of our population makes fun of British accent and you take that and make it sound like a majority, thus becoming what you want to make fun of.
Aluminium is what I got first on my phone then Aluminum
Alumininium
My dumbass first said lettuce, then bread…..
The greek guy that invented Aluminium and named it with the extra "i" : {[insert facepalm skulpture from ancient times here]}
Hello, I  am an American and I would like to say that we say it the right way and UK people say it the cool way
Idk why we do that, don't ask me!
I just want to ask.. Why Na is called sodium? But in Malaysia we called it Natrium.. Now I wonder why is that even possible?
“it wraps around a sandwich”  THATS PLASTIC BAG
I really just said "Beryllium" 😭✋
mmmm, we dont.
To whoever is this strict as to deny the answer just cuz it has an extra "i", cuz I know you mf are out there...HOW STUPID ARE YOU, its the exact god damn thing you cheesy shut-in talkshow shitlord.
In polish its "aluminium"
Only in America and Canada. I googled it 😜
That one teacher who won’t understand what we’re trying to say:
We won the war we get to change things 🇺🇸
Omg this was me growing up soooooo confused with British English speaking parents[🇹🇹] being raised in an American school system! The anxiety. English is hard 😭😂
Seems like he switched it up with the german word which is Aluminium
We say the same about you over here 🤣😐
This is relatable I just can’t spell words I’m not African
I think some american words are cool like “chips” instead of “crisps” and more, but soccer and football makes no sense at all
I’m so dumb that I thought it was bread
" *ALUMINUM AND ALUMINIUM* "  is basically the same don't make a fuzz out of it im not Bri"ish nor American but I pronounce Aluminium - Aluminum
He got a like only because of everybody hates chriss
I say aluminium the way the first guy said it but im not american
82% percent of the world spells it aluminium and they say aluminum
An indecisive English scientist is the source of all the confusion.  Chemist Sir Humphry Davy first named the metal “alumium” in 1807. No, that’s not a typo — it was neither “aluminum” nor “aluminium” at its birth, but according to World Wide Words, Humphry later renamed the metal “aluminum.” By 1812, he had changed it again, settling on “aluminium.”  Much of the scientific community preferred “aluminium” because it sounded good alongside other elements on the periodic table, such as “sodium,” “potassium” and “magnesium” — all of which were also coined by Humphry. Brits eventually backed “aluminium” — but the highly influential Webster’s dictionary told North Americans otherwise.
It doesn’t matter, IUPAC calls it Aluminium, so we’re correct
Americans really grind my gears
That’s my element for school 😂
the “everybody hates chris” at the end hit hard
Also ca and k for me😬
We in Canada also call it Aluminum. The other way is too annoying
it's because the first spelling was alumium, then the correct way of spelling was aluminum, then some idiot added an extra I and the british have been confused ever since. also, if more people say it one way and a small group say it another, when it comes to words, the majority are right. as America has a much larger population than the uk, we win.
I thought Aluminum was the product while Aluminium is the material/element lol
i- 🤣
That’s just because it’s the right way
Real scientists use metric for everything anyway
Im American
"I'll give you a hint, it is wrapped around a sandwich"  Me: Newspaper📰
I feel u
Bruh, one of the most stupid questions. Why you have to learn all this numbers of elements when you have fucking table behind you everytime?
Same here, we spell shit like color and favorite with a u in jamaica bro
I'm American and I always say aluminum the right way not how that says we say it
America butchers a lot of words,  like colour, aluminium. But it was done too make sending telegraphs sentences shorter.
Aluminium is right!!!
Well deserved, that’s what he gets for being British
It was actually called aluminum before aliminium
I love how I got the question right 💀
I literally googled 'is it aluminium or aluminum?' 3 hours ago
We don't spell it strangely we spell it correctly also question why do you call chips crisps and fries chips it's really weird
I live in America and I have never heard someone say it that way I say aluminum
Don’t worry, come to the Netherlands here we say Aluminium
Bruh it be like that
The teacher later died of road men violence
Violates basic rule of iupac.
Same reason why british people call french fries chips because who ever made the words just spit out shiznit that sounds right 😂
Had to subscribe for that everybody hates Chris sound at the end 😂😂
That teacher needs Jesus in his after class support
At the end i wouldve said “I’m from the UK so i say it how i say it, ALUMINIUM not that aluminum type stuff”
Yea that was crap the way it is spelt aluminum when radium iridium sodium natrium are all spelt differently. Yea l spelt it spelt. Deal widdit !
Real teachers would know both words of how to say it
Lol
English is my first language and I hate it. That’s why I will always pronounce Wednesday as Wed-ness-day and not Wends-day 😁
IT'S ALUMINIUM
Says the one who has a u color
Bri’ish pe’ole be loike
Wait I'm American I dont day it like that
I love that everybody hates Chris ending 😂
We just gunna ignore colour
I don’t see what’s weird
Especially color and colour!!!!!!!!
Aluminium in swedish
The way brits say it is actually right because Americans pronounce the U as a singular capital but its not
I'm more surprised about the fact that you wrap your sandwiches in that instead of plastic wrap
In Portuguese it's "alumínio"
British people call Americans intitles shots and Americans call British people British brats. Why cant we just get along
Me being Australian in America: *relatable*
Too bad Aluminium is the correct answer. Since most of all people use the word "Aluminium" instead of "Aluminum" guess the student in red is right 🤨 also it kinda sounds more fancy and scientific 😍
murican: color Bri ish: colour
i use both Aluminum for wrap and Aluminium for the element
Woah Never Noticed That Little Thing Just Watching that Parabola Behind u
How American people say it just sounds so wrong
We spell it differently
I know it's like colour
if aluminium is being said as aluminum then lithium should be lithum 💀💀
As a chemist, no one cares.
Cause their plain
Ok now i just realised that I've been saying it wrong    Im glad my science teacher accepts both lmao
My life Is a lie
I’m so smart man
Lol I asked my cousin about this and he was like wha?? You guys say aluminium??
Um what about color vs colour
oh great i said silicone.
Conclusion: america is retarded.
i was gonna say bread..
Hey chewkz i was scrollin in youtube and suddenly i got a notif abour a random livestream and it saulid chewkz is livestreaming and its a shiba inu bitcoin livestream i searched chewkz and its the only vid on your channel at that moment dud you got hacked or smth?
i just say foil
Funfact : that actually how we write aluminum in French  Aluminium :]
I’m English and how and why do you say it ALUMUNUM
It’s not spelled weird
So wtf is it ium or um ?
i remember reading the reason Americans have so many words with less letters is because back in the day printing cost was by the letter so they would take away letters from words they deemed unnecessary and it’s just never changed
I used to spell aluminium, then my senior high chemist teacher “corrected” it saying it’s supposed to be Aluminum. Now I understand that both’d be correct.
America bad
said it the american way once in chemistry years ago and i still think about it to this day…
Why do Americans don't understand the british accent all they need to do is be considerate.
It started as alumium and for some reason, they thought there should be another "n". Americans put it in between the "I" and "u" and the British added another "I" to keep the "ium" sound
The periodic table literally spells it aluminium 😭
everybody hates chris for telling the truth
In Romania we spell it Aluminium
In French, it's spelled aluminium
Not American nor English. But we call me aluminium 🗿✋
Right, we are the ones that say it weird.😳
How he is so tall
Hey man it's slightly less typing if i have to type even one less character or write one less letter then throughout my entire life its probable gonna save me maybe a few minutes and those few minutes could potentially amount to something
Who on earth wraps a sandwich in aluminum?
I just call it FOIL  (FO-YEEL)
Indonesians always call it "aluminium" instead of "aluminum"
I don't use American spellings even tho I prly should
Title makes no sense
Why do people in the uk say this word weird
It's just about what's more natural for the accents. In America we cannot imagine actually saying aluminium in our normal voice.
I'll admit American spelling is easier tho
ItS cAlLeD EnGlisH NoT AmErIcAnIsH!
Heavy is the head that wears the crown 🇺🇸
Ngel I did not even notice this until now I’m kinda shookt about aluminium
Well sure but who one the revolution?
I'm learning English and this just doesn't help
I thought it was plastic wrap...
Its aluminium
It's Latin and it's spelled aluminium, pronunciated exactly how it's written plus a double L and accent on first I. ALLUMÌNIUM, which is ALLUMINIO in Italian (maybe we know something about Latin pronunciation).  Americans simply do not know how to speak their language with Greek and Latin words.
No he said it with an extra “I”
In Greece the word aluminum is called "Αλουμίνιο". If you translate it to English letter by letter you get Alouminio Which is closer to Aluminium, Strange...
Aluminum aluminium
Aluminum
Ali min ium❌ vs Alu min ium
I knew exactly what was happening as soon as I saw the background
Ok the weird thing is. My recommended video underneath this is seriously Everybody Hates Chris.
Etymology of the word,  original spelling is the USA way,  couple it with the largest population that speaks English andddd
Humphrey Davy, the person that named the element, wrote it as Aluminum (not Aluminium) himself; by the way, Davy was a British chemist.
Yanks and their gibberish 🙄
One of my chemistry teacher called it "Almonium"
Why else do we have spelling bees? Do you think they win money for nothing?
Look who is talking
In DK it's the -ium variant.
plastic
Take that BRITISH PEOPLE!   AMERICA: 1 BRITAIN: 234
yo Chewkz, u English mate?
Bruh in my language is called "aluminio"
I'm american and i live in england so my brain dies every day in chemistry class
Alluminum sounds stupid
It’s aluminum
So I get the joke..  But as an American who says Aluminum, I have to correct my wife who says it wrong. Lmao
Tell me why I said bread
Cause fuk the crown and what it represents! Thats why!! No but seriously i am pretty sure thats why we talk like this.
It's aluminum
It's called tin foil tho
Hold my sodium
I feel the frustration. The takeaway for me from videos like this is that while differences occur between any language even between US English and British English the fact is the while every other country pays respect to these differences and the people who use them (try to understand the other) people in the US do not. In fact, they usually act as if they didn’t understand even though sometimes the expressions are almost the exact same, try to ridicule you or are quick to correct you. Which is deeply annoying to educated open minded people. Like: you understand me then why corect me?  This must have to do something with people in the US -not knowing anyhing about the other person- may feel inferior or even offended and try to gain back their power position. The other part may be a certain kind of tribal thinking (with me or against me) so that people pinpoint the differences and see how you react, and make you surrender.  This kind of thinking is present in the military, firefigthers, high school and mainly male dominated power play environments. There is a certain level of bullying in it too.  Can you imagine an US person being corrected in a British TV show? Very rare. People wanna make you comfortable,  not to look like a fool.  In this case the teacher should have said, correct, but the US spelling is different.   Ahh, done. Sry.
Why British spell differently?
Fr now the correct way to say it is aluminium bc it comes from the Greek Αλουμίνιο (aluminio)
I mean in my native language it's "alumiinium"
Aluminium is correct in German haha
Because the guy who discovered it named it "aluminum". Who cares about anyone's opinion after that.
Love watching people argue over such meaningless crap
Brits: How can it be Aluminum. You don't call it Pottasum or Sodum. Hahaha so stupid.  Me, also a Brit: Y'all never fucking heard of Platinum?
Just don’t be a homosexual and you might be able to spell aluminum right
Damn your tall
The main reason why there's a difference has already been said. But I think another reason why a lot of American English words are spelled differently than British English words is Newspapers. They used to charge for the letter, and so writers would leave out unnecessary letters. On top of that letters get cut out a lot on accident because writers are rushing/ aren't spell checking, and so the shortened word becomes the standard. In my opinion I think that actually makes our spelling more practical, because we clearly didn't need those extra letters- but I'm also kinda biased haha 😅
We don't spell center like centre
Aluminium is the right spelling
Because aluminum sounds better.
Aluminum was the name proposed by Humphrey Davy as the name of the metal that was present in alum. Apparently the other European scientists stuck with Aluminium instead including the ones who managed to purify it.
What do you mean no one in America says it like that
As an American I have never heard it spelled this way in my life
Mixing the 2 spelling can cause no problems ever. It's not like km and miles which are actually different.
Africans with an accent call it aluminium but I lost my accent so I call it aluminum
The discoverer of aluminum was British and spelled it aluminum, you guys are the ones that are wrong
the every body hates cris reference is to good
You know it’s funny the reason why our spelling is different is because back when news paper was needed each letter cost money it was to expensive so they decided to cut cost down by getting rid of extra letters like colour to color
Aluminum and aluminium both came from England >200 years ago.
We spell it like that cuz we be different like that we just stupid (sorry for all u american prodigies out there)
Not me saying tinfoil like 😂
Only americans say Aluminum, everyone else says Aluminium.
Saran
The 1. version is pretty close to the german pronaunciation
I said bread
Because we didn't get our asses kicked by the romans.
What's aluminium then?
As a russian, I highly dislike the American school system a lot
Actually. We don't. We spell it properly. England adopted new spelling and grammar shortly after the end of the revolutionary War.
Me:tinfiol
My chemistry teacher will actually accept either spelling which I thought was pretty cool. Even though I'm American and pronounce it aluminum, I always wind up spelling aluminium probably just because it's easier to remember, being that most metals end in -ium
Talk normal than
I thought he was talking about Saran wrap lmao
His clue: probably use it to wrap your sandwich’s  Me: Saran Wrap?
Yea yall say it wrong
They are weird
No one actually does this love the pull out your ass content
Say it in spanish "Aluminio" easy just change the "um" for an "o"
Aluminium = αλουμίνιο .... Like most of your words it's Greek origin....
It's not aluminium its aluminum
I'm so confused I've never heard an American call it Aluminium. I have only heard people from the UK say it like that.
I thought the word was going to be Wednesday
Everybody hate chris
Lmaoo not the EHC theme song at the end 😭
Because were weird
This is what confuses me everytime I encounter that "aluminum/aluminium" element.
That's my teacher when he dumb lol 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂
In Indonesia, we use the word aluminium... I never actually heard of someone who said aluminum before... It just sounds weird because I have never heard of it...
I thought he was gonna say tin foil 😭
Not “spell” it’s called “pronounce”
As soon as I seen “what is the 13th element” I know the periodic table and this cracks me up the way Americans spell it 😭😂😭😂
Used to say aluminium until everyone asked me why I say it like that so I just say aluminum
Actually, Brits came up with aluminum, and the changed to aluminium. Same thing with soccer vs. football.
Good job Ethan! 😂😂
Lol when he asked what element you use to wrap your sandwiches I said cellophane
Everyone gangsta when they realise he's making fun of Americans
Maybe it's because in spanish it's "aluminio"
To be fair the British man who named and found the element did name (pronounced the same) and spell it like the Americans do now
one of my old college teachers used to tell this a joke.  "keep repeating the word aluminum"  you will hear some very funny shit
Honestly I think the American version makes more sense, but of course when you think about it English never makes sense it just breaks its own rules.
aLoOwMiNuM
I thought it tin, "tin foil" 😅
English Channel? Uh, pass the remote🤢
BTW aluminium is more similiar to the latin original word
vibranum
Feel sorry for you bro
I've honestly never understood this it's so confusing Americans confuse me
We Germans speak that Word kinda the same Aluminium 🇩🇪🇩🇪
If that’s hard, y'all gonna go buck wild when u say bologna
Don’t ask me...
Come see me after class
Literally nobody in this comment section understands the science to this. Aluminum and aluminium are different.  The aluminium is more theoretical, like it's the element itself, while aluminum is more practical, like what we wrap around our food.
I checked and in the periodic table of elements it's spelled a-l-u-m-i-n-i-u-m
My US History textbook explained it like this:  A British aluminium (I also say aluminium as I am Italian despite living in the US) producer in the US began distributing product, but a typo resulted in a misspelling of the word “aluminium”, which was the normal word in America at the time. This typo, “aluminum”, was unfortunate, because this word began to spread and the result was the full integration of this word into American English as the correct spelling and the removal of the old “extra” i, now delegated to British English.
Ik I did not say Saran wrap.
Aluminum is pretty practical. Aluminium is the theoretical. The element is aluminuim but the stuff we use is Aluminum foil
Me who said seran wrap
When we updated the nameto be more in line with the surrounding elements in the periodic table, America refused the reprinted dictionary because... well it was the late 1700s early 1800s. They didn't like us too much at that point in time
🤣😂🤣😂 the ending though 🤣😂🤣
British English is by far more beautiful than American English
It can be spelled aluminium but officially it's known correct spelling and pronunciation is aluminum.
If you're talking about just this word then please look at a American dictionary all our words are f
Loved the "everybody hates Christ" in the background. 🤣
When I first heard the word aluminium, I didn't know what it was.  (I heard it in accent tags that used to be all over YouTube.)  It never occurred to me that they were referring to the stuff soda cans are made of.
😂😭😂😭
I pronounce the first one🥺
As an American, all I can say is yes. This is in fact how we are.
imagine you get an answer wrong in a spelling bee because of this
I say aluminum
American's spell words differently because they used to charge newspaper companies to make newspapers based on the amount of letters or something like that
Wait people say it like that?!?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saran Wrap
In german we say aluminium haha
Who the hell calls it aluminium?
Every time I hear it, the only thing I can think of is: aluminumnumnumnumnum
bro who tf says aluminium im not american so idk what y’all do here but aluminium sounds so stupid. aluminum just sounds way better
Aluminiam is correct
The person who found the element called and patented it named it aluminum. The UK/Brits changed it to aluminium because they thought the right way was to barbaric sounding. They thought it made them sound smarter. When in reality it makes them sound dumb and stuck up.
By statistics your the weird ones
Cause they want to be special
THE TEACHER IS WILT CHAIMBERLAIN?
Americans watch this like : /
The better question is, why don't YOU spell it strangely?
Even in my country we said aluminium
Well if you ask why then the only answer is ‘it’s America, expect them to do dumb shit’
Lmfao i cant spell it anymoreeeee. You say aluminum. I say aluminuminum
In french it's aluminium
Both of them are right
My science teacher once joked that Britain agreed to call sulphur sulfur if Americans promised to call it aluminium like everyone else, but the Americans lied and ended up calling them both the wrong name
Alumnininium
I have a British friend and she sometimes don't get what I say
U ar the best bro
EVERYBODY HAÆTES CHRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!!1!
theres no right or wrong in language. if majority in that country, area, community or anything agreed to call it that way. then its the language for that specific word. others might call it different and find it weird but yes. thats called language
I literally took 3 book of science of mine and my older sister to check the spelling bruh!
I mean, yeah it's weird, in as long as I know, in European countries it's spelled ALUMINIUM

Even in Dutch we say A-lumi-nee-um Aluminium...... Please correct me if I'm wrong Also isn't it what utensils or Planed are made out of....?   Cuz it's a light metal right?.... I got this in 4rth grade I think.......          Yes it's 2:46 a.m QwQ  Edit:so I just googled it and if I read correctly it's aluminum for American and Norway people...  And aluminium for the rest of the world including England
aluminium
The 13th element was discovered by kyrie its swish
Plot Twist: his weird shaped beard is actually real
Fr tho I’m from the UK and moved to the USA and I got suspended for spelling colour wrong, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YALL AMERICANS HERE SPELL COLOUR COLOR WHAT?!
I knew it was pronounced different but I never noticed the spelling change
Lol in 5th grade we watch the Australian guy not the Indian guy and he says aluminum weird 🤣also I watched everybody hates chris
I mean its spelt aluminium on the periodic table cause most of the rest of the world spells it like that. So that's the correct spelling lol
Why do like 50% spell "aks" and another 50% say "ask"
This is actually what I am learning in science
I mean they’re the same thing, you shouldn’t be punished for it
*joe mama*
It doesn't matter how he says it, you are talking about the same thing, I feel like a good teacher would never say "no" to that answer
In German we also say Aluminium, and the Germans basically invented the periodic table, so SIT THE FUCK DOWN BRITAIN
mf just be overcomplicating writing words and reading them super simply instead. +1000 meanings to a word, but if 1 letter is different it's also spelled differently but not always.
I’m triggered I’m amarican
If i see anyone pronounce it like "aluminium" I will punch them.
Both spellings were written by one Swedish guy in different texts.
I say aluminum but spell it aluminium
Fun fact: words like aluminum & color lost their extra letters in the US because printing companies for newspapers charged by the letter, so in order to save money companies cut out "unnecessary" letters.
*inhale* color, and flavor
Aluminum is much more intuitive, and I’m American.
This is mind boggling ALUMINUM ....... it's ALUMINIUM 😭
We call it “alumi” in Taiwanese
Because we hate the British
Why can’t we use the Latin names?
In reality, the elements on the table are named in Latin and Greek and some of them with the names of who discovered it. In this case the name comes from Latin, so is Aluminum.
Dont ask me I am not even english
I'm not a native english speaker, and I say "Aluminium" because in portuguese (my native language) is "Alumínio".
In German it's aluminium.
Ayy i’m Ethan
The teacher really should have acknowledged we say it different.
I- I feel so stupid I thought the answer was bread..
It is A L U M I N U M, simple
In india we cal it the same Alluminiyumm
I can't tell if he's an american that can do a really good british accent or the other way around
Me: My whole life is a lie
Well aluminium is the original way to call it tho.
We are not weird, just different.
In India it is aluminium
Aluminium just sounds better doesn’t it!
Bro fr though  Its ALUmiNum Uh loo Mi Num
They spell everything strange
Just like colour and color
Hahaha! Yes! I paused it Right after you ask the question and found it out of my head! Good thing I studied the elements
Soccer and the IMPERIAL system is all yall. Literally.
Spell Aluminum
I've always said it aluminum and I'm american-
Shouldn’t the title be “Why do Brits spell this word so strangely?”
I enjoy saying aluminium. Sounds cooler.
ikr
Aluminum
Why do you spell water without the t
Bener tuh wkwkw america harys gal usah buat simple name elemen wkwk
Iridium, Gallium, Uranium, STFU it’s a culture and grammar thing. Both are correct, but AluminIUM is the original.
We Americans like to take words and make them stupid for no reason
In spanish it is aluminio 😳
I can’t even spell
I wish more teachers cared enough to spend extra time with students.
I'm an American and when referring to the element I call it aluminium like the rest of the world.
In Dutch it is "aluminium"
It's like grey and gray and organisation and organization
fun fact: the guy who discovered Al did refer to it as aluminum but its the wrong one
Let's call it just *Al* from now on. It's the symbol for element 13 anyway. After all, nobody, even the chemists, cares. Nobody even care why the heck mercury is noted as *Hg.*
I’m American and I say it like that just don’t spell it
Thats what they deserve honestly.
Hahahaha
Actually it's y'all's fault we say it different. Because it was Aluminium but when sent us an article about it (Americans first time hearing about this) y'all didn't spell check. Y'all spelled it Aluminum in the article. And that's how Americans have spelled and said it ever since.
I'd say we both have different forms of English. No hate to the video! I consider both versions of English to be correct as I view all languages to be correct with their spelling!
Why cant English language just agree on one spelling
It’s probably spelled without the other i in America because a long time ago, when printing newspapers and things like that, they charged by the letter so people would omit unnecessary ones. That’s why a lot of our words are spelled so differently today.
😂😂😂Fakinel... I'm from Cameron and even teachers call it Aluminium..
Bruh
America made Aluminum, we changed the name in the UK
I believe they spell "aluminium" like the french way because they got most part from Quebec, a french talking canadian provincial
Jesus is coming back repent before it's too late this is not a joke he will accept you he loves u
The person who discovered the element called it aluminum but the British scientific community wanted the -inium like some other elements.
I like to say that aluminum is the product and aluminium is the element, but they're both correct.
Besides middle school I have never had a teacher say anything about spelling a word wrong
If I had a teacher like this I'd quit school
Fun fact did you know American spell it like that due to the newspaper printing press charging by letter. We do it with a lot of words like color or gray. Certain letters were cheaper than others and so they would just substitute, so long as you could read it, So they wouldn't have to pay more.
Why are you so racist?(I'm joking I'm joking I'm joking)
The fact that they think that the way Americans spell it is right- They literally removed letters because of capitalism I cant-
it’s spelled with another i?
Ooh he getting that extra credit😏
As 🇷🇸 it's aluminijum
It's funny how I can't comment something British or mention that I'm British without some dumb idiot saying "oi you mean you're a bri'ish "person" mate you have terrible teeth and you say stuff like "o' o' e' i' o' o" you also call chips crispity crunchity wackity dackity crispy dispy queen's delight crisps." Absolute idiots. The next person to comment that to me is about to get on my bad side I swear to god.
Different pronounciation
Well I can't pronounce if correctly either. I pronounce it as "Aluminium" too. I'm not a native English speaker. I must say though, English has some really confusing words like the pronunciation and the spellings don't add up.
This is so true sence in ScOtTiSh and moved to AmErIcA
The struggles of being British
How he spell: Aluminium How he says it: Aliminion
Nowadays it is scientifically recognised to spell it as aluminium so ye also, Americanism is way too intense like speak the OG English pls
There are a lot of things we spell weirdly
BRUV ITS BECAUSE WE BRI'ISH WE SAY ALUMINIUM
In germany  it is aluminium lol
Aluminum autocorrected word ..Again Aluminum
Okay most metals end with ium i am pretty sure its aluminium
Aluminium sir.  Wrong . You?  Aluminum.  Wrong. Its tin foil.
Who knows 🤔
Do you guys really… have elements questioned by their numbers? Why? There is literally a table invented for you NOT to do that! That’s the dumbest shit you can come up with about chemistry.
👍
I am an indian and I too spell aluminum as Aluminium
Americans are built different. They forgot the brain plug 🙂
Actually... the correct word is aluminum. Brits changed it because the guy who discovered the element also discovered calcium and so they thought it matches better with the other elements he named. But he officially called it aluminum.
Алюминий, на русском всё довольно просто ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
Aluminium I counted after pausing cos I know the first 41 elements
I said plastic wrap
As an Australian who talks frequently with American friends, this is a common problem
I’m American and I say it like a European because it’s sounds correct
Relatable
I say both
I mean you do to you just sometimes say stuff different
I’m dyslexic and also I hate English language because it’s confusing also I speak and because I believe in America
It's said the way the teacher spelled it
Bts v 💜 ♥ ✨  I love him and his btsss and I think that you are a very lucky 💜 ♥ 💖 💕  to have bts
In Indonesia we spelled it the same as the Brits, it is Aluminium, I can't wait to be called a weirdo when I travel to the US 🤣
Who tf wraps a sandwich with aluminum
This is america! Were we don't know how to spell words correctly.
Thought it was plastic
Another kid before him: “It’s alumni”
Exactly people make fun of me for spelling color with ur (colour)
It's called 'dumbing it down' ......remember that a man who is obviously suffering from dementia was voted into office. The rest of the country is at least a 110 IQ.
Why do you say it so weird
Well I'm american and I can say that I agree there is some words we spell that I'm just like wtf
i prefer wrapping my sandwhich in Plutonium
Saran Wrap. :)
This is relatable
I say alaminyum
Honestly i have no clue why so dont ask me
Aluminium:hey Pooh, how are you  Aluminum:they took my fucking eyes
In spanish is "aluminio"n so i got very confused XD
hydrogen and helium then lithium beryllium boron carbon everywhere nitrogen all through the air then oxygen so you can breathe and fluorine for your pretty teeth neon to light up the sky sodium for salty times magnesium ALUMINUM
Make a video plz
I didn't know that 😳
Me thinking of Vitas
I relate even tho iam not British. Cause we say aluminium instead of aluminum
And there goes me that always say it "Alumunium"
I never realised they call it "Aluminum" lol.
wait what ?? isnt it aluminium ? ive been spelling it like that my whole life
If i write Alumi both Aluminum and Aluminium show up on the correction bar thingy i forgot whats its called lol
"I'll give you a hint, it wraps around a sandwhich"  Me: BREAD
Where I come from its "Alumínio" so  would definitely say aluminium
I dunno
Aluminum
Maybe they're changing up our words so they can have their own language. Only 999.999 left to go😁
Aluminium?  I use plastic wrap XD
😂
In my place, if you spell Aluminum in Aluminium the kids will really laugh at you
aluminium comes from the greek word αλουμίνιο thats why the Americans spell it differently :)
Answer: Aluminium/Aluminum  Me: Plastic?
I mean it's dumb that a teacher doesn't know that aluminum can also be spelled aluminium
Aren't they both the same thing?-
I say aluminium all the time when we are talking about it and my science teacher like despises me
My school american language  Me - color  Also my school no
Most metals that exist in a positive state have their names end with -ium so aluminium is correct
Lol he had the everybody hates Chris ending I just watched that
Lmao, I've had trouble spelling aluminum up until 6th grade just because everyone around me says aluminium, I'm not even American.
Aluminum is correct. Gfy.
As an American, im proud to say that I spell Colour with a U, i started doing it as a joke and now I cant spot
Canadians and Americans use aluminum
My smooth ass brain just went "plastic"
One of the reason could be was that printing presses would charge by the letter so Americans took out extra letters they deemed unnecessary (like the u in color) to save time
Cause that was the name it was given.
My brother calls it aluminium we’re American
As an American ya’lls version sounds so much cooler 😭😭
Maybe, british spell it strangely??
You dare question us?!
Because I don’t know
I see the difference
Ok why did I just get a chemistry class video does YouTube now know I'm failing it!?!? Their just trying to rub it in
It's more about accents then origins
Everybody hates Chris-
This too hurtful
Memorized the whole periodic table table over like 3 weeks in science because the class was insanely boring, everywhere I saw it was aluminium, google, websites, even the periodic table on the wall
In Spanish is ALUMINIO
This is why i -hate- dislike Americans
English is known as one of the hardest languages to learn, manily because half of it makes no sense
As an American I for some reason use a mix of english and English spelling of words and it had driven my teachers mad. I have no reason to (no recent Europe ancestry) and raised in the Midwest. There are some words I use that I always use one spelling or the other and some I switch...  I don't know why brains are wired! Auto correct keeps it mostly US based english though :/
We spell things bad because in the old times the papers charged us for every letter so we removed a lot of letters from a lot of words
You can actually spell it both ways.
As a Nigerian, I can relate😂😂😂😂
British ppl deadass think “alumnm” is the right way to pronounce it
Because I'm originally from Australia, I still say: "Aluminium" instead of "Aluminum"
is it really super weird spelling something just by removing 1 letter?
In German it's Aluminium
He Said Aluminum And You Said Aluminium
Presumably it’s because of capitalism
You shouldn't be a teacher if you don't recognize differences pronunciation of spelling and words, I.e color and colour
Because it’s easier to say and spell and is better in every way.
as a singaporean, this is very relatable
LMAO "Everybody haaaates Chriiiis"
“Everybody ha-ates Chrisss” Poor Chris, atleast he isn’t in the projects anymore!
Wtf it's spelled how it sounds lol
I live in California and I’ve never met anyone who says “aluminium” it’s always “aluminum”
Everytime on my phone I'm trying to spell "colour" but it always autocorrects it to "color" which was kinda upsetting
I got very confused by this when I met an american one time
vitas
Moved to America from SA. This bothered me until I learned the history. It was originally pronounced and spelled aluminum, but the brits didn’t think that was posh enough or some bs, so they changed it to sound more like some of the other elements. Aluminum is the original word, the brits are the ones who changed it
Don't forget Magnesium and Manganesium
Tottally agree in germany we pronounce it with an extra i too so the american way sounds weird to us
English: Aluminum Shorter name: Al Poland: GLIN!
Americans reacting to this video : huh aluminium that's a very funny sounding word.
I can relate
i have never heard even as a trini hear someone say aluminium
Its not aluminium, its actually aluminum
as an aussie, i relate
Sounds weird as hell
I pronounce it like red too
Colour color, aluminium aluminum, centre center (and a lot of others)
that’s like colour and color
in turkish it is "aluminyum" so the way the first guy said it "aluminium" is correct for Turkish speakers
In Norway it is "aluminium"
The ✨ EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS ✨ was really funny
Tbh ‘Aluminium’ sounds like a Harry Potter spell.
I’m Canadian and my science teacher is from. The uk and i never realized that he wasn’t the only one who said it like this
Y’all put unnecessary u’s in words
“Who can name the 13th element?” My brain: theeeeeres hydrogen and helium and lithium beryllium-
Same argument as gray and grey
Flash backs to when I had to teach my American friends how to spell certain words be like
My native language is portuguese and if I went to study somewhere where they speak english I wouldn't be able to say or write aluminum it sounds so wrong, in pt it's 'aluminio' which sounds basically the same as aluminium
Why cant we have one english word?
Aluminum
Haha, yeah :')
Aluminum… Vs. ALYOUMINIUMENM 🧪
Something about paper printing being expensive
Aluminum alluminium
Canada: the chrome paper wrappy thing
Ikr weirdos
I'm an American and even I can say that our English is fucked-
Alumínio
We spell things differently because newspapers used to charge by the letter so we took out extra letters in words. TL;DR: It's because of capitalism
Is this dudes only characteristic is that he is British
It’s probably for the same reason we spell color with no u. It was unnecessary and easier.
Danm yanks
Ima be honest with you British folk. I am very confused with this version of english
it's called tuesday, not chewsday. where'd you get the chew?
More like why do you spell it so weirdly
In French we say Aluminium :0
Same bro
It’s because of a guy named Webster look it up
Mom= American Mum=British Same with aluminum
Bruh you say the word with each letter as a syllable
But it was originally named aluminum…
Aluminium is also the german word 👀🇩🇪
But there is an I
I thought our english is more american then we actually use a British ver
The reason Americans spell things weird is that when printing something you had to pay per letter so they took out the extra letters
The everybody hates Chris at the end was great
At the end it says "everybody hates me." Sounds like its from everybody hates Chris
aluminium
“GUYS WE FORGOT THE I” “GOD DAMMIT CHRIS HOW COULD YOU FORGET THE I” “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
In Uganda its Aluminium
What about Wednesday
Aluminam is correct
I said it okay
Man who gives a shit, I know what u mean
THIS IS SOOOOO REAL bro
Americans have pronounced things differently specifically for the reason that we want to be different from the rest of the world.
“Everybody hates Chris..”
I think this has something to do with Americans spelling things with one less letter to save on printing costs in the 18th century or whatever
A L U M Í N I O
Dude this sucks I was gonna get a 100 on my spelling test but this made me not. America is dumb
Americans removed “extra” letters from words because newspapers were charged by the letter
Almelins
Let's be real though British  English likes to keep extra unnecessary vowels.  Though it's usually extra 'u's not I.
Only og remember everybody hates chris
American's saying words wrong
people actually spell it like that? bruh
I think if you invent a word in a language all the other countries that speak that language should spell/ say it the same as you. Non of this USA jelly nonsense.... its jam, if you think I'm wrong your the human equivalent of a spork.
It’s Aluminium in German
Me an intellectual: How about "weak metal"?
Even In India its the same thing Aluminium
Here before 1 mil
My dumbass:helium😌
It’s said like hope it’s spelled dumby. Aluminum
It’s Alum metal. The other names are just convenience.
Nah British folks spell weirdly
I thought it was tin foil
Why I feel smarter after watching this? Lol
I just call it aluminum and I'm an american 🤷‍♀️
I can't define how offend these things make me feel.. if I ever say someone with a British accent getting treated like this. 😤I will be throwing these hands.
You look like basketball legend wilt chamberlain
It’s Aluminium
We spell it aluminium in german as well, so the americans are definitely the odd ones out
LEAVE THAT MAN AND HIS BRITISH SPELLING ALONE
my parents: *foil*
I am American and I purposely spell it as Aluminium
I find it funny, the language is called English, cus its from England, yet in America they say that the British have it backwards HUH
Idk its not my fault 😒
Aluminium is the german name of it so for me the 1st guy is right idk if he isnt right in english
Yes aluminum is easier
⟟ feel like that isn't fair, you shouldnt need extra help because you say ⏃ word and spell ⏃ word differently that others
Im confused isnt that how aluminum is spelled?
This is why my dyslexic ass can’t spell aluminum lol
Its Aluminium. South Africans call it Aluminium not Aluminum even my spell check disagrees with the second spelling.
For me its a-l-u-m-i-n-u-m I'm american
In Arabic language we actually spell it as the first guy both in writing and talking but I still don't get y u guys gotta make it so hard on ur selves but u do u ig u do u
So this that why people spell color with a u?
Aluminum
Idk we......     BuIlt DiFfReNt💪✨
Aluminium is also the German Version.
I was struggling during my chemistry test for this. XD
This one i agree with the americans, Aluminum sounds wayyyy better
Man my whole book is wrong then
Metal is metal
We all do things differently
We all things differently
In spanish is aluminio, so there is an extra i 🤣🤣
I say aluminum
That's what happens to foreign kids, differences in dialect get taken as the kid just being dumb.
Ok but like how is police now cops-
YOU guys spell it wrong
Attention a teacher was found dead in the science lab
Imperial moment
I really just said bread 🤦
Aluminum, Potassum, Rubidum, Strontum, Yttrum, Zirconium, Niobum, list goes on and on c'mon guys get it right
Wait my name is Ethan
it’s aluminium in my language….
Color > Colour
I dont care either way, but don't shit on the American way, seriously
Just call it alu
Really American? I just know by now 😆
In germany we say Aluminium 🤷‍♂️
I don't know why I'm so proud of myself for getting it right too 😭
MS WORD can't understand neighbour and colour. Keeps redlining my essays.
Jokes on you we speak the better English     When I mean “we” I mean Texas
When people try to say specific but they say Pacific 🤣
Old printing presses charged per character so we changed our language for capitalism. I love America
When Americans  do British impressions, they sound more like Birtish than British themselves.
I don’t know why do we have am and pm and why do we cut the days in half make telling time more confusing then it already was
Lol because its not alumanium
You use it to wrap sandwiches... What is.... Saran wrap
Butterbrotpapier?
I live in America and its spelled the same in my science classes but we say how the American says it
We feel the need to be special and I hate it. It's like all the words for pineapple in other languages are near the same And then American English is just way different.
Another reason aluminum in American English is spelled that way is because a lot of paper companies started removing letters to make it cheaper to print and then we just stuck with it
This is what happens when a people rebels and separates from their origin... and then make up adjustments to words that pre-date their entire country.
For american pronunciation the spelling makes sense, why we would spell it differently in the first place now that's a good question!
Aluminum was the brand and Aluminium was the element at one point, then people just called it by the brand, like when people call any soda "coke"
I.... Didn't know it was spelled any other way, I just thought that was another way to pronounce it.
Well aluminium is just factually wrong so...
I thought this was normal
i have never in my life said aluminium
I said Saran Wrap, then thought tin
I literally know no one that says it with an extra “i” here in America, it’s always been Aluminum.
"You probably wrap your sandwiches in this " Me:tin
That’s like saying it’s stupid that words in Greek are spelt differently then English
Dafuq im american and never heard it be called "aluminium" before
My family is Sri Lankan but I grew up here in Canada. I've learned to say it both ways depending on who I'm talking to. Same with a lot of other words.
Um because we want to be different but we lazy as hell
Aluminum thats the correct way bruh not aluminium
Every body hates Chris is prob the best show ever
Yoo thats true
No clue what's up with the us lol
My teacher did that to me 😔 I missed the bus
why do americans make fun of british when it is the british that made the language
I’ve been watching a lot of British content creators recently so I think some words have been programmed into my brain in a British accent so the other day I said something that was super British and I didn’t even realize until the school bully came up to me and made a really sexist-racist comment I will not say
Im American and i pronunce it as the second guy
I always say Aluminum and spell it that way… but I’m American… or so I thought
Fun fact about the US, the main reason that so many letters were dropped was to lower the amount of ink used on a printing press as it had to be imported and was this much more expensive
Aluminum in UK sounds so much weirder than American aluminium
Alluminum sounds really clean to be fair.
The British say it the same as Australia does
This guy like tall Kevin Heart
Sorry USA, but aluminum in British sounds more cool
I say aluminum and I am american.
well thats not the case in brazil 🤨 we say aluminio  it sounds pretty like aluminium
Because of capitalism
The Everybody Hates Chris at the end tho
My grades learning the elements rn lol
BECAUSE WE'RE IDIOTS!!!!!!!!
As someone who lives in America, I also don’t get why we spell it like that
Americans are just desperate to be different from British
As a Canadian, This is relatable. (How do they spell Colour as Color and not get disturbed?-)
Even i french we say it as aluminium
What..every video is the same u make fun of ur dumb asss accent, it's not funny, can u come up with anything funny or even somthing other then "hey guys the way I speak is funny right guys right??" Fuckk off
Even me as an American I don’t understand this
Omg it's like when I started living in America and went to school where people spelled "colour" like "color" and spelled "favourite" like "favorite".
The reason is cuz when we used the printing press we got rid of unnecessary or what we thought were unnecessary letters cuz the righters or publishers would be charge by the letter so capitalism
Fun fact : aluminum is spelled aluminium in German
Aluminium was the first spelling. But then the guy who discovered it changed it to Aluminum. This is the Jif vs Gif thing all over again but slightly dumber.
I paused at the question, thought for a sec and remembered it was aluminum. I probably should have figured it out from the title though lol
Both are correct.
I was literally counting on my fingers to try and answer the first question
I'm American and don't call it that
Because its the spanish word for aluminum
The "Everybody Hates Chris" at the end was spot on
One of my classmates said it was tinfoil instead of aluminum 🗿👍
Aluminium and aluminum are in my phone as real words, so they are both right, I spell it aluminium, and say it aluminum
It was mispronounced at the NY stock exchange
Because the English language is weird in general no matter where ur from. If u speak English in general u speak a weird language
Jesus died for your sins
What’s the name of the outro song?
I was told that the reason why in America its called aluminum is because when aluminium was like a gold a company in American called themselves aluminum since the proper term was aluminium. Since then we started calling aluminium aluminum.
I don’t mean to be that guy but I live in America and have never heard anyone ever say that before
An American here and we say it the same way as every one else
Capitalism.
In the netherlands we also have “aluminium”
Aluminium there is I between n and u
Its easyer
Why? Because thats how the guy who discovered the element named it. Yall brits just changed it. So uhh.
They're the ones spelling strangely then be like "you need help"
I've never spelled it that way and I'm American but I sure do know alot of people who do and it's just funny to see how they spell it
I do both as an American
Love this guy’🤎🧡🤎
Aluminum is the correct and first spelling but after being urged to change it to fit with the other elements the guy did. So essentially think of it as aluminum is the name and unless you call gold by its scientific name too aluminium is wrong.
The look he gave at the end looks like a look Chris would give.
Jea same for south afrikans
In India we also use british english.....
On my periodic table i have both croatian and english and on cro side it sais aluminij with double i and even on the english side it sais aluminium so i was confused as well when he said wrong lmao
This is relatable as hell, for India. For people wondering, India was under British rule for 200 years in the past, and we are adopted to British style of formal English
I can kind of understand it cuz it makes it shorted but idk
I'm American and I don't know how to pronounce that myself
We…we do???
I’m sure that actually wouldn’t happen in an American college because I’m sure the professors already know most languages
Wait, so this whole time. I've been spelling aluminium the non American way- I truly thought that was how it's spelled-
It's like platinium why do they say platinum
I really like the 90’s sitcom aesthetic in your videos.
In Romania it's "aluminiu", so, the wrong spelling, got across the sea lol
I think it is due to The German heritage as in German it is aluminium
even Singapore follows the UK english i still find Aluminum weird
Ou den bruvs wooi dew Americans spell it so weriiiid 🧐
Both Spelling are right!!  Well I googled it OvO)!!
It’s the come see me after class that had me dying😭😂
But in my country we call it alumunium, like most of people call it like that..
The guy in the red is probably a tranfer student from Germany because here its aluminium🙏
I love your accent, say it Loominum foil
Aluminum foil
In Poland we say it like that
Same feeling being an American in Britain.
Same things happens with PLATINUM.
If one letter is dropped it's because of advertising in newspaper (which was paid by the letter so letters considered unnecessary to recognize the word were often dropped until it became standard)
My native language is so broken and janky.
Aluminium (German version- i need help too!?)
I think its cause americans are infuriating. This is coming from one.
The word aluminium used to be the original word in america but was soon changed to aluminum. Like germany(with their language) we just wanted to be different but if you ask me, I don’t really care
STRAIGHT FACTS
Damn I call it that too
It's like saying "colour" is wrong
The everybody hates Chris thing at the end 😂😂
Aluminum just sounds so weird to my British mind
In France we say « Aluminium » too
If you really want to know why Americans spell things differently: if I remember correctly one of the reasons is because newspapers and etc used to charge by letter so they just dropped some letters
I had no idea that there is different ways to spell it
Me an American with bad spelling: y dude he did nothing Rong
I say it 2 ways lol
Extra i, its literally spelled Aluminium.
Aloominum
Why do you Europeans spell your word so strangely
In thai, we say "อลูมิเนียม" which pronounces as "Aluminium" not "Aluminum"
Aluminum Aluminum  Wait...
German here: In Germany it is actually an extra i in there. Please do not make your mind up only on one Language.
So in the US there is no the "extra" I ?
So wait..which is the American way?? Because I’ve NEVER heard Aluminium and I’m American.
I still say the relish was is right as it's our language lol
i don't know why i thought plastic-
If Americans want to be so different from the English language why don't they just make their own language instead of making the English one weirder.
We’re all different and I think you’re exaggerating. We may say things differently and stuff like that, but not all of us can be like that..and some people are probably taking these in an offensive way.
We don’t you dumb
That moment when chemistry became spelling bee
Maybe because it's easier to say uloominum instead of aloomineeum
Thought aluminium was the normal one since English is my second language, and aluminium in Spanish is Aluminio
it’s the same bruh
Am also a science student but just for few seconds I also forgot the spelling of aluminum 😂😂😂
I know someone who says it: "A-LOONY-UM" 🤧💀 we laugh everytime but we know what he means
Fun fact, the reason Americans shortened certain words like aluminium was because for printings they used to charge by the letter, so they decided to shorten certain words and it just became the norm
Wait other places call it aluminium
Literally americans always think theyre right but usually its the entire rest of the world that agrees on aluminium
The actual fact behind a lot of different spellings in America comes from printing presses and saving ink, they shortened words to save money
Why do brits say this word so fuckin weird
Let go I got  a science question right
If you wanna piss off everybody call it by its original Dutch name “Alulight”
The real question is why Brits spell it so weirdly
Back in the olden days American newspapers or books were charged by the letter while Britain and other places were charged by the word. So America dropped of letters to not have to pay as much money. That’s y
It sounds. Better that way not the other way I like the way. Americans speak cuz I'm a American
just because were in a different country and we say it NORMALLY a little different than how u say it NORMALLY
It’s still the same answer cuz it doesn’t rlly matter about the thing just sound it out
Damn, Americans have problems pronouncing "Ni..."
Literally nobody in the history of ever has ever said that. At least, not here. And I live in the rural parts of the country.
It was actually a British chemist who began to call it aluminum, and it eventually spread to the US, and both ways were used in both countries.   Ultimately though, aluminium stuck in the UK because they thought it sounded more refined, and aluminum stuck in the US because the man who found a way to mass produce it called it that.
Ah. Ha. Ha. Ha.
When he sad you use to wrap your sandwiches i thought it was bread
Not me thinking it was cling wrap 💀💀
Well English was complicated in the beginning, England has had many different languages
Cause thats how it was originally spelled and said.
I spell it like Alu-min-um
In simple terms us Americans are just straight out weird like that
I'm sorry to all of you foreigners for us Americans we're just weird like that there's no way to explain it sorry but also for everyone who keeps asking asking there's no explanation other then we're just weird simple as that simply put
Is it just me or does he look just like the guy who plays Hardison from Leverage?
This is actually an interesting topic. The ACS started calling it aluminum in 1925, but the UIPAC started calling it aluminium in 1990. So in the United States we call it aluminum but in Europe it’s called aluminium.
It's aluminium and I don't even speak English xd but still is pretty close to how is pronounced in Spanish
Damn son,English in US sure is very different from English in British,get me a Bo oh o wo ah
NOT EVEN A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE!! Jist ignorance
...absolutely rediculous. That is the proper way to pronounce and spell it.
That's how it is pronounced tho... alu min ium
Anyone else guess silicone, or am I the only dumbass?
I like the way the British 🇬🇧 spell it but I like how 🇺🇸 we say it
They are spelled different ways because they are two separate things
I think its really just about laziness, one had 4 syllables and one has 5 hmmm which one is easier?
Can we write it as aluminim🥲
The main reason is because they have a desire to be different from Britain, and they should be, despite speaking our native tongue, America decided to change spelling for some words and even made there own up which are not actually English such as "yall" English language is made from 2 primary languages, old English and danish tongue, these two were mixed to make one language, hence the similarities with Danish words. America then decided to be different and chqnge things slightly with noo influence other than they want to be as seperate from the UK which makes sense as they are a superpower. But never the less they speak English not American. The reason they want to be seperate also is because America was owned andd use to be a colony of Britain, so after independance they needed to cut off the ties between them and Britain, but couldn't change the language so they just changed small things.
The funny part to me as an American is that I dont think I've ever wrapped my sandwich in foil
I actually just learned this, when the USA was created, sending letters as printing things with words on them was the prime form of communication and advertisement. When people wrote letters, they had to pay by the letter. Same for posters. So we just left out letters
Bro I say this at my school and everyone Freeks out because they say it’s only spelled aluminum
So I think that Aluminium is the element and Aluminum is the foil or the actual stuff
Typical Americans.... remember when George w Bush said " the French don't know the meaning of the word entrepreneur " embarrassing 😂😂😂
I’m French that’s how to spell it. I’m French
Well see here we spell it simple but you people spell it well like everything is diamond
Bruh that’s different u say it like the “American” but we say aluminum
*Guy in the back "YOU RACIST"*
YOU'RE THE WEIRD ONE!!!!
That's the northerners
We use to say it right.. most folks born in about 1910 use to say it right, all 4 my grand parents use to say it correctly. How it "evolved" idk.
I’m not British but I still say it that way 🙂
"Everybody hates Chris" 😅😅
I have no idea why Americans say it like that
Bruh my name is Ethan
We spell it that way because that’s how it’s pronounced basically
I was thinking bread
Tinfoil haha
Whoever says aluminium is weird just doesnt know other languages exist
There is no extra *i* 👀 👊😎😵
Do Americans say that??? I’m Kazakh but like can someone tell me I say Aluminum
K-kian?
Cause we retarded
Why do y'all SAY WORDS SO WEIRD!!!
I mean I call it tin foil
They also spell colour as color
It’s the everybody hates Chris for me 😂
Americans name it weird but British people literally gave it an extra letter and mispronounce it
It’s different spelling just like color and colour or favorite and favourite
I’m in Canada and my science teacher doesn’t really care which spellling or pronunciation we use
I'm American and this is true
Well that's like color and colour like tf you english speaking people have that difference
Clingfilmium
One is an alloy the other is a pure metal, that's why. They ARE different.
I mean there are languages that call these widely used metals by completely different words.
I know I’m dumb when I said Saran Wrap
I feel this guy’s pain lol
That’s what it’s supposed to be
Tbh aluminum is easier to say and sometimes even as a Brit I accidentally find myself saying aluminum instead of aluminium
Its because our english is retarded
Y do Americans spell things so weird
Sir Humphry Davy discovered aluminum and named it such. It wasn't until later  that same year that another british scientist said he disagreed with the spelling because it didn't sound right. So he added the extra I. And the two different spellings stuck  in different places. So if you want to be absolutely technical about it, aluminum is probably the right way to say it. However, it honestly doesn't matter and I dont know why its such a big deal.    Edit: Davy also discovered and named sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, barium, and boron
Yea wer in America 🇺🇸
Why do u spell it so strangely
Strangely? Homey you guys added an extra I
American version of English is literally like asking a 5 year old to try spell and pronounce words 🤣
Actually Britain used to spell it like us before
british problems
Before there were an official standard, some elements had several different names. English speaking people and especially Americans just didn't change the way they said it.
America does a lot of stupid things
The fact that you can spell it is just weird
But see here, the way you guys say it is weird to us
Rip to the people who said Tin foil....
In spanish is "aluminio"
Look man I ain't even British and I feel this pain deeply
When I'm an american but say it as Aluminium 👀
It isn't America's you fucking dumb donut. Uneducated say Alu-mi-nIUM wrongly.
so, printing presses used to charge by the letter. Aluminum, Color, ect a bunch of words had "unnecessary letters" that were striked out so that it cost less to get something printed.
There's no extra I in aluminum
Because newspapers charged by the letter
Actually it's the English who spell Aluminum weird... Sorry my friend from across the pond.
Well thats how we actually call it in Germany... Aluminium😅😂
In French it’s aluminium😂
Lol like even in other countries its aluminium like I think only America says Aluminum
This legit helped me lol
Me: plastic bag?? That isn’t an element
America is so stupid xd
I think my teacher asked us a similar question in class one time, he also had a giant periodic table sitting up on the wall behind him that I could easily read
I had this moment in my middle school science class, but I was the one who said the American Pronunciation. To be honest, now that I am in college as a chem major we don't care which one someone says as half of the time molecules have several ways to name them that are all correct so Al is so simple with only having 2 names.
The reason why American spells thing weird is because we used to charge per letter in newspapers so Americans started removing extra letters that's why we spell color different and aluminum and that's it for my ted talk
"alluminio" in italian, we feel you Brit!
That's just Americans being lazy again
Tego nie pomalujesz
In italian is alluminio and we say aluminium as well 😂
I'd answer the meme if he'd asked what's the 7th element
It’s called an accent
What the fuck do you mean its not aluminium
Our whole language is fucked
A life mystery
The one in the red has some style though ngl
Both are correct names
Nigga said aluuuhhhhminum
Why? Because different languages have different words dumbass
Why Americans spell things weird? We’re cheap.
Easy, don’t be British.
Cause I don’t know if you know this but the are different countries and accents for a reason
Everybody hates Chris. Love that show
Both are right moron, The term aluminum is generally used in mining stuff while aluminium in chemistry.
Wrap my sandwich...that would be foil
Love you!
Americans spell it color English people spell it colour. America ruined the English language
As a Asian even I can relate
The word aluminum came before aluminium..  Aluminium became the term for it to refer to the other properties of the metal and because most people at the time thought the ium ending fit better with the other element names (i.e. potassium, magnesium etc).. Took 5 whole years for them to change it from aluminum to aluminium. So technically speaking british people use the dumb version of the word
Well, Canada says and spells it the same way. Aluminum is a derived word of alumina meaning bitter salt. And because of alumina, we switched the 'a' to 'u" and added the 'm'. Aluminum and aluminam would sound more similar to each other than aluminium.
Everybody hates Chris reference, nice🤣🤣
As an Asian, I find this normal as I wasted years of my life watching American videos over Youtube
Hey, why do we call it gas, when it's a liquid Why do we spell fridge with a D but we spell refrigerator with out one. Why do we say though, dough, and bow, they sound the same but spelled differently. Why is it that teachers say "I before E except after C, what about the words foreign, Forfeit, height, Neighbor. We spell things weird for weird reasons by weird people who don't know what they're doin. Weird
Even though our measuring system is bonkers, somehow we got aluminum right. Properly efficient and easy to pronounce. If I need aluminum in an emergency I can ask for it, not her royal majestically sacred royal alumininium
It's actually aluminium in Spanish 😅 Idk, makes me think of theories
my stupid ass thinking its plastic
I was going to say glad wrap
And here we pronounce it "Almunium"😂😂😂
When u use science words in SCIENCE class
The apparent reason for this, is the same as for color. That reason can be summed up in one word; CAPITALISM.  Basically, printing companies cost by the letter years ago, so we cut out "extra" letters.
As an Indian, I always wrote and pronounced it as Aluminium as well. Never knew in American English it would be Aluminum.
Ethan……………….
American pronounce it the way the guy who discoverd it wanted it to be pronounced but either one or a few members of the scientific community in England can't remember changed it to the way the uk pronounces it because they thought it sounded fancier
Do you know that the Washington monument is capped with an aluminum pyramid which at the time it was built was more expensive than gold?
Well Americans say what do brits spell it so weird
The rest of the world calls it Aluminium. This just being US being wierd as always.
Why do British people spell it so weirdly? See it’s about perspective, it’s weird to you, because you were taught to spell it a different way.
I really can’t go to the USA because of this. Some American on twitter was being a smart-arse because I wrote ‘paedophile’ and in the USA they write it as ‘pedophile’.🤦🏽‍♂️
The first.one is actually correct thou lol
Western education
Cimmonimium
I mean there is a reason why when selecting English as your language, the american flag is always set for simplified.
I'm american and i wonder this too
Thank God there's no reincarnation, so most of us won't have to be British
Yall spell it out like aluminyum
Why do brits pronounce tomato as tuh-mah-toe? Guess we’ll never know.
That's real strange
Idk why but I thought it was plastic
Sombody called the cops on me cause im american😅
Bro so true and I live in the US lmao
So the professor was right...right?
Yep we spell Aluminium oddly but you guys call Cotton Candy Candy Floss despite it much more closely resembling cotton.
I heard that, back with the printing press where every letter cost extra, the American newspapers decided to reduce the sizes of official spellings and phrases and this became so commonplace that it continues to this day.  Whether this is true idk but I do know that British people disagree with the words for things just as much so it's fine tbh, we just like hating on those yanks 😂😂😂
It’s because we had a tax on our letters when we were colonies it’s also why there’s no u in color
Guys, guys it's sodum, lithum, beryllum.......now, what part of this confusing to you?
You know that to us, you spell it weirdly
Because we are sophisticated!
I'll be honest, I have no idea why we spell it that way
You guys spell it weird
No one in America says aLumIniUm
Why do Brits add extra letters to words that don't have any right to be there. Take armor for example or as the Brits would call it armour.  This post was made by the reasonable spelling gang.
My man grew a beard just for this
I guessed Saran Wrap
In germany we call it aluminium lol
Too many syllables
As an American. I cannot answer you
We changed it in the 20s.
We don't
If anything I just assumed that we use aluminum when explaining it to younger children just because it's easier for them to pronounce
Support!!
Dude. I swear to GOD. I said “Aluminum” without knowing that was the actual answer. IM SMORT!
In French you say the I lmao
When I was taking chem (in America!!!) they always spelled it aluminium for some reason.
It's just our dialect we can't help it
Scientists have agreed its aluminum.  I just asked
Bro that everybody hates chris at the end gives me so much nostalgia:D
The whole joke is that we are saying the way he says it is weird, so captioning it “Americans spell this weird” is literally going against exactly what he’s saying
You can’t lie tho The way we say it is easier
So many elements end in 'ium' but Americans for some reason changed it to 'um'... this has always confused me, like what was the point in one letter?!
I don't spell it like dat innit
yea the american version is actuslly the original.
Americans spell it weird cause they spell it the correct way
Oh my god. My teacher used to scold me all the time last year for saying Aluminium 🤣😂
In Trinidad 🇹🇹 this was stress bai
As a american i dont even know, its dumb
The fucks wrong with you americans i don't get it... all those weird words
Cancelled > Canceled
Just because it’s said different doesn’t mean Americans do it wrong
Americans be like: I speak an entire language of WRONG.
Color
As a Brit, this is hella relatable
Aluminium is the correct name for the element... in Germany.
Wait whaaat i didn't know this tooo thanks lol
The American is more right
We Americans are just stubborn Colour—Color Humour—Humor Flavour—Flavor Labour—Labor
"Aluminum" is in English  "Aluminium" is in French
Short answer: Capitalism  Long answer: it was cheaper in the us with early newspapers to drop letters.
Aluminium in my language because we make things easy
But it the actual way of saying it though
Ethan or Ethane?
Botle o waer
WE, spell it strangley?
Tbh england and america have the same colors so how are American language is not the same as england
My name is Ethan💪😎
You read the u as iu
Bc that's how the word should be spelt saying it the other way makes me want to punch whoever's said it
So my English is actually British all this time...
Amelinum
Both are correct in any possible way
The british one just sounds a lot better
So the naming of aluminum/aluminium is a bit messy. Sir Humphrey Davy was the scientist behind the discovery of aluminum, but he couldn't quite settle on a name for a while. Over the course of 4 years he would can it alumium (1808), then alumine (1809), and finally settling on aluminum in 1812.  Someone who wrote a review on one of Davy's lectures referred to it as aluminium .  We call it aluminum in the US and Canada because it was what the actual scientist behind the discovery of the element ultimately wanted it to be called.   The British and most of the rest of the English-speaking world say "aluminium" because some guy misspelled it in a written review. And for some reason it stuck. It wasn't even any of the names Sir Davy ever considered.
“Aluminum” was the name given to it by the actual person who found it.  “Aluminium” was given to it by some anyonymous scientist who thought it sounded cooler. Take this information how you want.
In German it's Aluminium too man😂
What do you mean we say it differently everyone I know says it the same way as you
Bro even I would understand what you are saying
Me: bread
Dang I hate it when I get corrected it feels so embarrassing and once I think of something and raise my hand I always forget what I was gonna say
The question is why do Brits use such archaic spellings? Drivers license, for example, is how it's spelled.
Actually no longer true due to iupca the governing body of chemistry it is spelt and pronounced aluminium but sulfur is spelt with an f to keep the Americans happy
People made of that smh 😂
✨✨It’s not us it’s you✨✨
What's with the British always adding an extra letter to words? I'll give y'all the metric system being easier to understand and use, but your language bruv? Ain't it.
U remind me of one of my teachers except u are skinneir
Umm I live in Texas with an American mother, and have american neighbors, Nobody has ever said it like that.
The person who named it named it aluminum but other people kept calling it aluminium due to alot of elements ending in ium
Man Americans complicate there English
When the uk think there better then America🤡🤡
Because we can. Why do you all spell it "nium"?
Why us? Why you
It actually is aluminium but we are lazy and call it aluminum
Or…tin foil :)
The less amount of letters the better we dumbasses can exist XD
maybe you should say it right
For once I agree with the bri’ish
To blooday tall
Fr. In norwegian it’s also aluminum, and probably most of the world too tbh😂
Wait, you guys get an extra i? In poland we spell it aluminum and if you spell it wrong you can get legit laughed at from the whole class
If I become an American teacher and this happens I will consider it correct.
When you can't even correctly speak the language you started 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ah. That's how it's spelt in Afrikaans. Oops 🤣
as someone who lives in europe aluminium is correct
"Aluminium" sounds ridiculous
I thought somebody's rich ass would say Gold lol
New paper pay pur letter so American to cut back cost cut out letters that they thought they didn’t need
I don’t trust people who say “aluminum”
Actually YOU say it weird
he's thinking of the metal lmao
We say aluminum to bro
If you want the real answer why Americans dropped a bunch of letters from words it's exactly the same reason people do it today: character limits. Also for adds you paid by the letter.
As always the US is being weird and going out of the norm
Relatable as fuck
Try IRON
There's no I. Even in elements they want to have some Imperial superiority.
I was taught to spell it aluminium but still pronounce it aluminum
If the queen didn't fancy herself the most important person on the planet then yall wouldn't be calling it aluminium either.
Aluminium feels so much better to say
This guy is dope😂
To be honest the reason why would actually spell like that it's because that is actually the proper way it was patented as aluminum
They spell thousands of words strange like that, when they first became independent from britian they was like "Let's CoNfUsE tHe ReSt Of ThE WoRlD bY mAkInG wOrDs DiFfErEnT"
If teachers were AI
There is an extra "I" 😒.it's aluminium not aluminum
Fun fact: different cultures say things differently
It's Aluminium... stop being stupid America
Well, in German it is actually Aluminium with an extra i uwu
It was originally aluminum when it was discovered, but the scientists that he told were like "yo fam, that doesn't sound like an element name. We're gonna make it aluminium now." So that why it's two different words
Aluminuminuminiminum
I’m American and we don’t spell it like that…
I fucking hate the word aluminum
That's me teacher always do like this to me
You now how we spell aluminum? In Portuguese is Alumínio.
This is always so awkward
Tigini
Every language has its own variation of this word (Aluminium, aluminio,...) but most of them have a second "i"
It is the exact same thing. Just the way you say it just means you might have been raised your different part of the world. If you say it the first way you were probably raised around Europeans or Australians. Because I know this I watched a lot of European and Australian television growing up and I'm American and I say it the first way not the second way and everybody likes to make fun of me The only time I say it the second way is if I physically focus on what I am saying. Otherwise I see it the way I like
Americans? Americans from wich country? xd
Weird thing is, they use both, as a metal they say aluminum but as an ingredient on medicines and things they say aluminium
In the periodic table it is spelled aluminium but we cut out the i because well idk we wanted less printing tax like how most stand words where made it whent from it is to its cutting 1 letter off ad reducing the cost to print
To be fair it was originally aluminum but became aluminium. But if he was actually a good science teacher he’d know both are recognised as being correct pronunciation and spelling internationally
Cause we built different
Actually in german it is called "Aluminium"
As a Swede I dont care how u spell it
Agreed- I have friends in an American based school and I’m in a British based school so there’s a lot of speech and spelling differences… ;-;
Me in my head wich one is right
the British is right here its their language so its their rules
Funny story. A british person named it aluminum and told the americans. Soon after other british people made him change the name to aluminium to sound more latin.
And here I am saying ‘bread’ 💀
It’s because hes black
Alumin Yum
wait i actually never realized tht american spell it like that LMAO
Bruh I say both sometimes
This makes me remember watching people play Fallout 4 and the inevitable arguments in the comments about this words pronunciation.
I m just wondering may be he entered in class and started asking questions and didn't even cleaned the board coz there is math shits written on it       forgive my english plzzz😂   Bro i was trying to be funny this ain't funny yet and I won't delete it coz it took me some time to type it
Damn I would have said clingfilm
Americans....    THEY AIN'T BRI'ISH INNIT
Aluminiminium
In french we say aluminium as well
The same reason you over complicated the word color
How many lies have I been told by the council?
America: because we tried to be original
How do we spell it strangely y’all just spell it longer and ours sound better y’all just hating cause we ain’t British no more
Same as colour and color
Americans are a different breed but thats ok, I gues
My school follows British English.
Even in India we say aluminium
It's latin, so it's Aluminium.
Founders were uneducated lmao
They spell it weird because they said it weird, until it stuck. Which is also why they didn't change any of the other ium elements, cos the dumbass populace were using those.
Cause dey built diffrent
No this is just america being different because in america it is spelled as “aluminum” while everywhere else it aluminium
That teacher dumb af if he doesn't know this
Cause we're too lazy to pronounce that many syllables
Too make it funny brain process is slow but in way I overlook things but I really said bread 4 seconds after he asked.
Who tf uses that to wrap sandwiches
My mom is hispanic and calls it aluminium
I always spelled it and see it spelled aluminum. I've never heard someone call it aluminium. Yet I'm American!
Want to know the correct pronunciation…. Listen to the song born called born on a horse by Biffy Clyro
This not just for British people but all the other nations which uses British English grammar
It's aluminum not aluminium.
This guy confuses the absolute fuck out of me. Is he English doing an American accent or vice versa?
"Because I'm American and we invented the English language."
It's spelled like that for the same reason we drive on the right side of the road. And the same reason coffee is marketed so much more than tea. Because it was the opposite of England. Revolutionary war America was petty as fuck.
Sodum potassum
So that is why some of the old Filipino folks pronounce this like that. They must have copied from americans.
Who uses foil to wrap their sandwiches?? Plastic wrap (cling wrap) is a much better way to wrap them and even so sandwich bags exist too.
We say aluminium here
Alumiini 🇫🇮
Sons of the colony messing up the language
The reason for Americans spelling things differently has to do with postage prices if I remember correctly you had to pay for every letter so they shortened the words
fym americans lol. y’all don’t even say it right🤣
Aluminium was discovered by a danish physicists and he spelled it " aluminium "
Because they borrowed our language but were too lazy to use correct spellings, pronunciation and even just make up dumbed down versions of words
America be like: “We’re the only country in the word that says things this way. WE ARE THE RIGHT WAY”
Actually, Aluminum was founded by a British chemist who originally named it Alium, but people said that it was a stupid, so he changed it to Latin word Alumen, which people still didn't like, so he finally changed it to Aluminum, yes the American spelling, and that was the official name since. However Europeans started pronouncing it as Aluminium and later changed the spelling to fit the pronunciation.
I think you mean all yall spell this wacky.
Aluminium
When Your class is in the hood 😂
Aluminium
My dumbass would've said paper
Bc their americans
And here I am being a dum dum. Saying plastic or tissue paper.
Actually it was the British that changed it to the weird version of saying it
Every USA ever: Aluminum British ppl: Aluminium
I've heard it's because there was this reputed aluminium-ware maker called 'Aluminum' and their products were so popular that the name Aluminum began to be used for Aluminium in the US. Now I don't know if it's true or not and I'm too lazy to verify it myself
The reason we in the United States spell especially long words like aluminum differently, is that during the beginning era of America, when the best way to get the word out was via newspaper, people were shared for their spots in the paper based off of the amount of letters, so people used simpler vocabulary and removed some "unnecessary" letters like the u in colour and armour. Also the extra I in aluminium.
BOH’O’WA’ER
What's funny is aluminum was initially named in the United States. So we don't spell it wrong or say it wrong. The rest of the world does. This became so big years ago on yt channels that do engineering projects. So the creators started looking into it.... The US named it so it's only right to pronounce it as we do  Please see Humphrey Davy
Cocanum
Imagine saying petrol
Go back to Europe brit
American's live in their own dream world
I wonder why there like that, maybe it’s because we have different dialects and the scientist who wrote them spoke different languagez
I’m sorry to say this but your not funny so just stop please
But aluminium is the correct spelling everywhere else in the world.
Thats funny because here in brazil it's aluminio
In German he was write😂😂
Simple Americans ans their poor language.
Ah yes sodum
Do they actually day it like that
I had a british teacher that was shipped in to our poor school, even we got the whole different spelling thing, though one girl refused to accept that he called fries "chips"  saying, " chips crunch, fries don't crunch!"
Actually for me were I  live its the exact opposite
Considering we have the original British accent we are saying it the correct way know your history folks
Who can name the 7th element?  "haha haha haha blblblblbl hahaha"
"You probably use this wrap your sandwich" "Sodium Chloride" "Huh?" *Proceeds* *to* *cover* *the* *sandwich* *in* *salt*
Imagine getting twisted over how a country you don't live in spells something lmao
Its been a great debate with no clear answer of facts to back up who was the first to come up with the word.  Americans say it 1 way and the enish say it another. At the end of the day its the same just pronounced different
I don't get it either and I'm American
This is too relatable
In Arabic we pronounce it "Aluminium" 😆
Most spellings are from what I've learned due to letter costing in ads and such.  So they were shortened a bit to save money and just stuck. Don't quote me on this though. May be slightly wrong
I don't say it either way and I'm from the US
Yo, the brits messed over my boy Aluminum. Trying to change to aluminum...
First: who raps sandwiches in Aluminum foil Second: It’s just spelled different bc of how it’s pronounced seems normal to me.
Misprint
It took me years to realize aluminum and aluminium were the same thing
Hey! Wait a minute…
I spell it aluminum
It was originally aluminum. And later change to aluminium
Ima American and I don't know how to spell easy words so
It like that for everything though
Strangely? You mean wrong
See I knew people said it like that
I was gonna say paper
Im an American that says that and everyone looks at me weird when i say it like that and it ticks me off
The things is, I live in Australia and used to live in NZ,andv I would say it the American way instead of the normal way
If this confort you, in Portuguese we say: Alumínio  So, almost right (a second time)
You could say that either way is weird
Why do you spell color with a "u"
In Germany it is Aluminium... 0.o
Thank fuck I'm not an American and this is how you spell it aluminium
Can't believe ur already at 741k, I subbed when u were below 100k. Kept the God Job fam!!!
Bro stfu. Stop making fun of Americans. People like you are why I can't wait for human life to die out.
Could someone help know the name of the song that got played in the ending?
Sir Humphry Davy, a British chemist, discovered this metal in 1808. He also discovered and named sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, barium, and boron; lots of “ium” usage in those names, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Davy originally gave this element the name aluminum after the mineral alumina, whose name derive from the base alum which means “bitter salt” in Latin. This original spelling straddles the two competing versions we have today. By 1812, when Davy published his book Chemical Philosophy he had changed the spelling to aluminum. As in the American version with one “i” and ending in “um,” aluminum. However, later that same year another anonymous scientist wrote an objection to Davy’s spelling aluminum in a British political-literacy journal, Quarterly Review. This other scientist decided that Davy’s spelling didn’t sound sufficiently Latin, and proposed the name aluminium, stating “for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.” Many people, this anonymous scientist included, thought that the “ium” ending was more consistent with other elements; much like the others named by Davy.
I thought it was plastic 💀
Your whole existence is based around you not being an American
I was at school, and i was confused which is right, with the i or without..  BECAUSE THERE'S TWO BOOKS THAT SAYS BOTH :((
No, actually they’re two different things
😂😂😂😂
Nigga pops said it's aluminium
To me British spelling is weird, it's kinda funky saying al-you-min-e-um
So uranum then
Not really apart the videos but I like how YouTube just copied tiktok with this shit
America is just completely clapped like fam the guy who made the American version of English was like a little salty baby he prolly was like "hmph im gonna steal. off ur language but make 10% of the words and other stuff absolutely stupid and make no sense whatsoever"
EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS!
Bruh I’m American but have you ever heard of ACCENTS clarify that next time PLUS we like to annoy the British  >:)
Aluminium
Color verse Colour. Same for honor verse honour.  🤔Those are two sets of same but differnt words that i can think of.
To be honest, I have no clue why we do.
My first language is Portuguese, and the name of the element is aluminium there, and Google Translate confirmed that the extra “I” is still grammatically correct. You can already assume I’ve had a lot of people “correcting” me, and that’s the worst part of learning English as a second language. The uncommon, yet grammatically correct version of a word that, while making the most sense to you, won’t make any sense to others
We should just not go to America. Let the fucks be weird across an ocean.
200 years ago, an American accidentally said “aluminum” and all the Brits told him it’s wrong, so he changed the spelling to hide his mistake
I'm just waiting for the Brits to see the forms o English that came before then they'll understand why Americans changed so much.
Well, the official language of chemistry was German till WWl. We pronounce it very similar to the Americans, therefore they're right.
The everybody hates Chris at the end 🤣 sad that 90% of people won’t get it
So are the rest of the elements that end in ium just um in America?
To us you spell it weird it’s just country difference matter of fact I didn’t even know aluminium was a thing
If your college professor doesn't know that brits pronounce and spell aluminum, aluminium then you have more problems than just a misunderstanding.
Laughs in German
I live in the US and in my Chem test you had to name the 1st 20 elements I put down aluminium and they counted wrong... it's the same damn thing
Wait until he find out about wednesday
5th element is Bruce Willis 😎🇺🇸
There is English, and there are mistakes. Both of them were spelled and written by drunk Irishmen.
What colleges professor no what fucking teacher goes their entire career not knowing the other spelling/pronunciation of aluminum
Most asian learn from british it aluminium not american or canadian
A do not say aluminium
How meny subs can I get from this comment Goal 200
Its cause Americans are lazy so they just cut out letters from certain words
Originally was aluminum. It was  later changed to aluminium so that it followed the naming convections of other elements like potassium and sodium. So Americans just use the older name for the element
Actually there all wrong...you wrap your sandwiches in cling wrap
Aluminum for life.... less syllables, also why does it bother you? More important things to trip on
As a American, yes.
Cause Aluminium is german, and many Americans where german settlers…
Cause we are stupid
In german it's actually aluminium
and here in my country it callaed alumunium,,,
Aluminium is correct 👍 .. all are latin names in PT ....ALUMINIUM FOR GOD  NOT ALUMINUM This teacher 👎
I had a classmate that was British. We made fun of how he said Aluminum all the time. It became the basis at school for how we determine if someone is British, we ask them to say Aluminum.
Actually..... It's spelled like that in German
More people in the world speak American English than British English. So who’s weird?
Breh he says it wrong we say it right way go America
Had a teacher count me as wrong on a test for spelling it that way. I’m not British, it’s just easier to sound out that way
Why do you say it so weird?
He needs to spend time at the "libary"
Dont worry I couldnt tell if you were wrong I cant spell
It isnt spelled weird you just say it wrong
Your sayin it wrong too
It's aluminium because there are only 3 other elements that end in just "um" but closer to 40 that end with "ium"
All English speaking people out there. In Germany it’s called Aluminium😘
I prefer using iodine
Im American but ever since ive heard it said this way like when I was 10 ive only said it this way. Just feels better.
Uhh we named it and your pronounce it properly England
Probably a throwback to the days of the telegraph when words were shortened because senders were charged per character. Colour/color, cheque/check, etc.
It's not strange, it's just a wrong spelling... aluminium is correct.
Ah-loo-mee-nuhm
I had this British guy guess where I'm from and instead of saying aluminum like I always do I kept on saying aluminium
It's literally got a fucking I in it
MANDELA EFFECT!!! MANDELA EFFECT!!!! MANDELA EFFECT!!!! MANDELA EFFECT!!!
pov: america is better in so many ways than britain
Going back to the first shipment of Aluminium to America there was a spelling mistake on the order card
AMERICAN GET SOME SENSE A$$HOLES
I think at the end it should have played “It’s a hard enough life for us!” 😂
Because it's the original spelling given to it when named by Humphry Davy in 1808. Over about a century, the accepted spelling changed in Europe.
Aluminum makes perfect sense to me. Aluminium just kinda sounds weird to me.
It’s not strange it’s just different
The way that tire and color is spelled always threw me off
Just simplified words that you guys made so dam stupid sounding
This dude look like Isran with that beard.
English words should be spelled in an English way Not American, y’all coming up with new stuff just to be difficult i swear
Actually the american way is correct. Hear me out, english originated from german, in german it's called "Aluminium"
It’s because you brits spell properly us Americans spell it simple that’s why👍🏻 (edit) fun fact for everyone who doesn’t know
To be fair, it would be weirder if we spelled it "aluminium" but pronounced it "aluminum"
Aluminium is now the proper way to say it announced by IUPAC
Wait... I am confused I have never heard it said that first way.
There was a typo when aluminium was being imported to the US and they just kinda stuck with it.
It’s a German word not a fucking English one
The funny thing is, in Germany, you actually write and say "Aluminium". Its even like this in the dictionary.
You use it to wrap sandwiches  Please tell me you also thought of paper or plastic 😂
Americans dont wanna expend any more energy to write that extra i, they might lose some weight by doing so.
Nah our spelling is the best
Aluminiy in russia xdd
Here in Brazil we say "alumínio" so I think its closer to the british version
Literally me in the US
I hate the way he pronounces it so much-
Feel like it’s the product spelling vs element spelling
Aluminium is german
Tin foil
Look it up, we Americans say and spell it properly.
I actually say it like that
I'm not an American I'm indian and i spelt it ALUMINiUM
If yall never watched everybody hates chris u didn't have a good childhood
It's Aluminium. Looks like teacher needs to see the periodic table
Wait so it isnt alluminium
Aluminium  Is german...too..
fr tho what other element is spelled um not ium
Thanks for this piece of info
Aussies: foil
Actually thank you very much, I suspected the difference was due to american-british differences, but wasn't sure. So now I know.
Speaking of this debate about witch word is right the person who named the element spelled it the English way because he was English but pronounced it in the American way it wasn't until after the English science community decided to change the pronunciation to the way it is now.
Bro does this dude have anything that isnt: "poor me I speak different to the other people"
Even my family says it right and we don't even speak English ( I learned it as a second language
When he said what do you wrap ur sandwiches in I said clingfilm 😂
i was watching everybody hated chris at the same time i was watching this so at the end that made me crack up 😂😂😂
In Hebrew its how the person "who's wrong" says it, aka how its written and how it should be said. So yeah. U doesn't always make a O sound.
If The World Was A Classroom Brits: Colour Americans: wha? Uhh *writes color* Brits: Aluminium  Americans: umm wut *writes aluminum* Brits: Free Healthcare Americans: *insert Billie Elish voice* stop. What the hell are you talking about?
Oof in French it is Aluminium
Hah. We Arab spell it like the British
'Aluminium' is the original spelling, as when it was discovered, it was named in latin; they spelled it with the 'i' like every other element.  in conclusion:  america bad
The US just salty that England used to own them then they got all big n shit and got rlly independent n shis.
Why is this dude keep getting recommend, all his content is the same, it's either that he's tall or is British and there is no way to just click not interested which is so annoying.
Long Story, but capitalism
Honestly, I love British accent. But damn, I'd love to pronounce as Aluminum than Aluminium.
I like the sound of al-yoo-min-ee-um better.
ACTUALLY it was a bot'OWoto' .
.... There was this one time where I asked the teacher if I could have something but since I'm bilingual I kept saying it in my language and she was like "what's that?" And when I said it in English she was like "uh? What-" I'm like "You know what it is" my classmate had to help me with the pronunciation :") she was too English. She was so confused while we leaving the class because I was the best in the class but unable to pronounce a single word.
I will stick with aluminium since british chemist sir humpry davy discovered it in 1808 while american chemical society officially adopted aluminum in 1925 Since my country say aluminium too instead of aluminum
All the spellings are correct. The name of that element has changed several times, it is widely disputed what the right spelling/pronunciation is
I think with the American accent it's a lot easier to say aluminum then aluminium
Don’t get gout kids, everybody hates Chris was goated
I just recently learned that it's not a weird accent thing, America really did change the spelling for some reason
In South Africa we also call it Aluminium
ACCURATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
U gotta say that oooo right
in my country we say "alumínio"
Алюминий
Do British people call platinum “platinium”
This always bothered me
Probably because is the way we spelled in Spanish
Americans found it, let aluminum stand.
Don’t forget “neighbor”
Honestly as an American aluminium sounds cooler
In my place  we called it alumunium
It's from fucking latin
In Poland it's aluminium
Idk, but us South Africans also say Aluminium
Don’t remember this being an English class
We indians can relate. It's Aluminium here too.
Cause American education system is a joke
I don't get it too.
Aloominoom is not correct, it's al yu min ee um
You English screwballs are using tge Dutch word 'aluminium' rather than just coming up with your own, that's okay.  We Americans just choose to do it OUR way. Same reason we use ALOT of different spellings and words that differ from the British.  Lorry (wtf) = truck... colour = color... telly = TV (I mean if you are gonna abbreviate it,might as well go all the way,right?)  And lest we forget. British Spelling = "No one else cares outside the UK"
We in germany also spell it aluminium
If that's true, then we need consistency. So, let's change calcium to calsum, magnesium to magnesum, sodium to sodum, etc.
Over here in nzl It gets confusing cause we copy both countrys
Even as a Trini 🇹🇹 is this relatable as hell
Indonesian spell ALUMINIUM too...
Get your words right english people , on medeleev periodic table is Aluminium
In german its litteraly "Aluminium"
me who thought vehicle is venhicle
Germany also has the extra "I"
Hey man i got the better one in INDIA🇮🇳 we say "ALMUNIUM"
American version is far easier to pronounce
Give me the 7th element
British “people” moment
Indians spell it just like the British Aluminium
Actually, aluminum is the correct spelling. Sir Humphry Davy named the element alumium in 1808 and then changed it to aluminum in 1812. British editors changed it to aluminium to be more in keeping with other elements such as potassium and sodium, while the Americans retained the spelling as aluminum. So the Americans are correct, not us Brits
No spell tea and say it English people I dare u
Did you guys forget Color, I mean colour, I mean color, I mean.....damnit!
Aluminium is actually the latin word, so...not being a native english speaker and knowing the original latin word I would've made the same mistake
my teacher jus simply says they are both the same so why make more out of smth so small 🤷‍♀️
Αλουμίνιο Aluminium End of story.
Umm he is saying aluminium 🥲
In Dutch it sounds way more like the uk version 😂
Funfact: In Poland during chemistry classes we call it "Glin", but normally It's "Aluminium"
In Turkey we call it Aliminyüm so kid was right
WAIT THERE IS NO EXTRA I IN ALUMINIUM?
Who wraps non cooked food in aluminum, I use plastic if its sandwiches
People don't realize that the way the Americans say it is actually the original way the person who discovered aluminum said it
Man can relate I don’t like when teachers do that 🥲
Bro you look like the black tall guy character in G.I Joe part 1
Lol my science teacher was like “as long as you know what it is, what it does, and I can read it, I don’t care how you spell it. This isn’t English class”
Wait...isn't it called aluminium?? I m genuinely confised
the fucc is aluminum
Well the reason we spell color and not colour, it's because we're taking the u out of it. Get lost in England./s
How do ppl pronounce it like that
Me: Aluminumium
My dumbass: Paper towel
There was a girl at my university in south Texas who was from Ghana and didnt know who Christopher Columbus was in my history class.
These are just getting tedious, basing a whole channel on us vs uk language difference is just getting boring.
In my country illiterates spell it almunium
Math on Blackboard & question from chemistry. 😭
Germans taking the easy way out, saying "Alu"
I was in an exchange programme in the U.S for a year, enrolled in a chemistry class and the teacher jokingly said to me that I got the answers wrong (Wrote aluminium). We had a good laugh and he told me that Celsius is much easier to work with lol
Aluminum was found by a British guy and named it, it was pronounced how Americans pronounce it. Then the brits changed it to sound more posh.
India is stubborn about aluminium  , that's all I am gonna say
The reason why Americans spell it differently is that they spell it the way it was originally named, however to make it rhyme in the periodic table it was renamed, so essentially you could argue that everyone else gets it wrong.
Lmao i would side with American on this one I'm from Poland and we say Aluminium.
Dnt argue with murica. They might send their troops. Hahahaha
In here, we call it aluminium
There is a reason most games give options like ' english UK' and 'simplified english US'
Let's squash this debate and rename it. Hence forth it shall now be known as aluminuium in favor of both spellings. "nuium".  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
in spanish it is aluminio
Because we're 2 fucking cool for tea language and the metric system we have freedom units instead
God! After seeing his videos I realise what all things Britishers have left in India, the side of the road we drive, the language the pronunciations , the spellings all are same in India!!
Damn! Even here in India we say it just like the Americans even though we are supposed to use British English.
Americans that don’t know how to spell “Aluminium” and are proud of it 😂
My chem teacher.  actually did this to me. I told him "oh okay seen" (his name is sean)
If ya wanna answer to why we spell it like that it's that when America was young printing presses for things like newspapers charged by the letter so people spelt words without unnecessary letters in order to save money. Eventually the practice became so common place that it became normal to spell things like that. Not really a strange way to spell it just a different evolution of language then British English.
The form aluminum is in common use in the United States; the form aluminium is used in Great Britain
Meanwhile the latins
If you translate both forms of the word in romanian, you will realise "aluminum" is wrong
Imagine wrapping up your sandwich with aluminium and when you get to class your sandwich and your backpack is a portable hell
Is this an English class or a chemistry class?
Americans have the worst spellings and expect that they have the correct form of english.
That's so unfair!
To us yes aluminium is considered a half wrong half right and aluminum is also half wrong half right as to the point where we use both words in paper its correct still
I’m American and I have never heard anyone here said “aluminium” before.
This actually cleared this up for me, I didn’t understand why they pronounced an extra “I”. I didn’t know they spelled it different
It is "aluminio" in Spanish so I'm with the English guy on this one, Americans are weird.
I live in South Africa, and we spell it the British way
When u say glad wrap
We spell things "weirdly" because back in the day when someone would pay to put an ad in the news paper, they were charged per letter. So we started changing words like in the video or the word "color" vs "colour" to save on costs
Australia is Literally copying America tbh
Al foil.
Nah YOU spell it wrong
Why did pilgrims ever leave England to start America 🙂
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium
It was originally aluminum but was decided to be aluminium because it sounded fancier. Then both were accepted but Americans didn't want to be like the British and chose aluminum. Plus there was a time that print charged by the letter, so some words were changed like colour and armour
Same happened with me but i am Indian
This reminds me of the time my English teacher said it was buses and not busses
American is trying so hard to make them different, but they look different like 🤡
Nah man. They're all wrong. The correct spelling is alumnum smh.
“You probably wrap your sandwiches in the 13th element”  Me: cling wrap
Americans actually pronounce it right the way the British say it was a suggestion on who to pronounced it but it was never confirmed so the American pronunciation is correct
we we don't?
Americans always spell things weird. Not just this.
To us you spell it weird Which means that neither of us spell it strangely
It's initially called as Alum then Aluminum a  then got a name change to Aluminium
I have to say that Americans gotta Understand that every other language has there own ways of spelling British English and American English is different hens why some words are spelled differently  Like when I moved to The UK from South Africa   In South Africa we call crisps chips
This is some cray cray gray grey shit.
Why more word when less word do trick
Because of the -ium suffix it was just easier to change the name.
Look man, it’s a different country. Not everyone does everything the same in other countries and we don’t bag on that. Let’s just stop roasting cultural differences like a pissing contest
Aluminum is the original way to spell it, but everyone except Canada and the US changed it to aluminium to fit in with everything else ending with ium
in Indonesia we spell it aluminium too
Who wraps sandwiches is aluminum?
aluminium
true
It matters where your at that’s how you say it unless it’s legit said how it’s spelled
Aluminium is german
I never knew we spelt it like that.
They just wanted to be different. U know it, American ingenuity. So they changed from the British way out of spite.
Back in the day to print something on a printing press you would be charged by the letter, so we made words a little shorter like colour to color.
Well if ur in north America  u would say it aluminum but in britian you would say it aluminium. Say it the way the country wants u to say it
I get that pronunciation can be different, but I never understood this one. Isn’t it spelled Aluminum, and would therefore be spoken as the American said it? Or am I wrong and was Aluminium the original spelling and pronunciation?
Dont get me started on colour 😂😂😂
I’ve been spelling it both ways and sometimes I switch between one and the other I DONT KNOW WHICH IS WHICH
Let's have a war over which is correct.
Idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Damn the gemans says it like it
Sorry about this americans but an international body on chemistry has agreed that the british way is the correct way and all papers published use it.  O and its also Mum, not mom
Wait sme people say and spell it like aluminium
My dumbass said out loud while in class Saran Wrap. He showed it to us cuz  hesaid he found this while home and wanted to show us.
You thing thats strangly spelled wait till you see Wednesday
Pretty sure a teacher should know that britains do have differences in english
HONESTLY. In my opinion, if the UK/Europe adopted the language English, then American English technically is incorrect
Let’s test this out, if I type in aluminium, my phone says it’s incorrect. So that means that it’s spelled wrong lol.
Because it was/is a fuck you to England.
The reason we spell it differently is because capitalism
A British chemist named Sir Humphry Davy actually proposed the word “Aluminum” to be used to shorten the unnecessary aluminium. Americans adopted this shortening. So the brits really did it to themselves.
If you use aluminum to wrap your sandwich’s you deserve to be yeeted into the sun.
Its because in the traductor and the teachers teach us like that
For anyone wondering it’s to cut down on printing costs for ads. Same with color vs colour.  Truly just capitalism
why do the british spell it weirdly
I'm Google for this #gg.
hhhhhhhhhhh. This triggers me too much
I really don't I'm not amarican
In 1790 it was called alumina, by 1812 sir humphrey davey had coined it as alumium, aluminum and aluminium during various lectures. By 1935 it was determined that adding -ium by davey to conform with naming standards for other elements. Neither is wrong, aluminium just sounds better.
Because it was spelled, and pronounced, the "American" way when it was made.
What are red yellow and blue primary COLORS now all the English people can be mad indoor confused about what I'm talkin about
Aluminum is what the inventor named it
I say aluminum
Bri’ish “people” be like alumininmuininumuinmuinm
It was aluminum then everyone decided to change the name to aluminium but the US said screw them
The question should be: why do u spell it so strangely
I once got suspended for calling my sweet old teacher "dear" I'm English, she's Canadian. Didn't see a problem but I got 3 month suspension for "acting sexually agressive" to a fucking 76 year old ladies.......
THIS IS AMERICAN
I’m American and I still say aluminium
Ooh ooh I know this one! Capitalism! …if you think I’m joking I’m not.  Back in the day it costed a lot for ink in news papers, so Americans removed “unneeded letters” and it stuck around.  TL/DR Cut letters because of costs
How is aluminum the weird one and not aluminium?
Cause they’re not British?
So is the guy that got it wrong British because that’s not how we spell aluminum and we don’t pronounce it like that….
I'm American and spell and pronounce it the uk way
This is pretty hypocritical considering brits don’t pronounce t in British or the second o in bottom
In italian we say "alluminio", so it's strange to learn this
Fun fact aluminum was the way that it was originally spelled but then the discoverer was going to a posh event to announce that he found this element and decided that aluminum wasn’t posh enough so he called it aluminium instead and it stuck everywhere except in certain countries which still call it by its original name...
Why these Brits always messing up the English language?
English language = English spelling, fuck outta here with that wook American grammar
Aluminium (with the extra “i”) is the correct way to say it idk
It is Aluminijum in my language
As an American who like to try British accents all the time it’s cool to see it the other way around and hearing the little slip ups 😂
Wow that's how spell it in arabic too i bet its same in spanish so i think British is the weird here .. lol
Growing up American I never knew we did this weird.
Oh know
America moment
It was a translation error.
Because American colonists pronounced  words differently over time while being away from GB, so after the American Revolution Webster was like we need to change how we spell things to match our pronunciation.
Americans don’t say what he is saying
So true!!
Bru y'all be saying it wierd
They spell it differently because they tried changing the language to appear smarter
Because the guy who discovered it called it aluminum but British scholars wanted it to be more fancy so they wanted it to be called aluminium
It’s because Americans remove and add letters unnessacerily.
Everybody hates British
Bc the guy who discovered it spelt it aluminum. And other scientists at the time felt it needed the extra I to sound more Latin. Doesn't make the ium right. Aluminum was discovered by sir humphry Davy. "By 1812, when Davy published his book Chemical Philosophy he had changed the spelling to aluminum. As in the American version with one “i” and ending in “um,” aluminum. However, later that same year another anonymous scientist wrote an objection to Davy’s spelling aluminum in a British political-literacy journal, Quarterly Review. This other scientist decided that Davy’s spelling didn’t sound sufficiently Latin, and proposed the name aluminium, stating “for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.” Many people, this anonymous scientist included, thought that the “ium” ending was more consistent with other elements; much like the others named by Davy."
It’s kinda weird that both Aluminum and Aluminium developed as words at the same time
Ah yes, just like the other well known elements Sodum and Potassum...oh wait
Not me thinking Saran wrap is a 13th element
I'm sorry, but aluminum sounds much better then aluminium, same thing with gas vs petrol. But everything else considering british terminology is okay. Edit: ITS ZEEE NOT ZED, THERE IS NO D IN Z
Element 'Na' ... mmmh what should we call it... Na-trium? No, So-dium sound more like it.
Its chewsday innit
Ima go throw my aluminum in the waste paper basket
Me on my way to listen to ‘Titanum’
Yeah there's no second i uhlooomeniumm
I’m American and use English language. Like pronouncing
Lol i get it, these people dont go to school lmao.
Americans always feel need to change everything!! Even when football World Cup went to America they changed the bloody rules!!!! 🤬🤬
Germans: Wait what?
I love the everybody hates chris such a nostalgia
I believe the reason that we say it differently is because the guy who discovered it kept changing the name and the U.S. was like, "fuck this, we're not changing it."
Loved the everybody hates chris at the end
Well it does say aluminium at the periodic table I have in my room
America is built different this is why they made no progress in Afghanistan
they also call pavement sidewalk like they cant figure out where to walk and where to drive 🤣🤣🤣
Aluminium sounds stupid
Pretty sure it's because signs way back then cost money based on how many letters there were on the sign. So they dropped the "i" to save money. I think this is the case for a few different words.
Fun fact: This is because an old american company that sold aluminum actually made a spelling mistake in a sign. Everyone started calling it _aluminum_ even tho it should be _aluminium_ , and it's been like that since then
Atleast he knew the answer, my dumb self said " tin foil" so confidently i embarrassed myself in private😭🤚   and now im sharing it
Hey British people, stop naming things, and then changing your minds 20 years later. Aluminum is the English version. Aluminium is the latinized version.
The red shirt guy is correct the other are just weird British alliens
That is why you say the chemical symbol for the element (in this case 'Al') when there are differences in the language you try to communicate with.  I know this is a joke, and yes Americans are haha weird for using Aluminum instead of Aluminium, Bri'ish better bibibi, but we could ridicule a lot of languages for this exact reason.  That's why instead of completely dismantling a lot of words already existing, scientists gave each element their own chemical symbol and agreed upon a scientific name (like Aurum - Au for gold).  I usually laugh at these kinds of jokes, but this just didn't hit the mark for me unfortunately.
You spell color and armor with an extra U.
Alumininum on top!!!
I'm cool with ALUMINIUM but I will never understand where people get NUCULER from NUCLEAR.
Russians: aluminiyuminiyum
Do one on sheh-joo-ul (schedule)
O sayyyyyyy cannnn youuuu seeeeeeee
In German and my native language is it Aluminium KILL AMERICA
Americans :"Aloomanum"
Here in ma place we call it Al! Prob solved 👍
They speak our language so they should say it as we do
Curiosamente en español es aluminio jajaj
aluminium sounds way cooler
How tall are u bro
well if you thought that was hard just  look at this word pterodactyl...thats a dino its pronounced teh-ruh-dak-tl  this is why I hate english
Aluminium is right bro in hunagiran its the same but with a ú and í because we say those letters just as usial but longer and amricans just want to make eversthing simpler evens stuff that doesnt need to be easier
Why the fuck ist Aluminium Aluminum? Never knew this (I am German)
me: saran wrap
In spanish we say "aluminio" so its more comfortable to say "aluminium" lollz
We spell strangely? We do?
Bruh even Germans say Aluminium
Its simple, to confuse the Russian spys.
They really had to mess up all the spellings
Because in america there are many european influences, and in european structures you get that extra i.
Be'cause this isn't Brit'in
The fact that the periodic table from my country are just- Aluminum ---> but when you read, you need to read Aluminium 💀
I ain’t never heard tell of sodum
I googled it, the student was right.
Maybe British people should just say Aluminum
THE EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS MUSIC IN THE BACKROUND I LOVE THAT SHOW
Then Potassium and Magnesium should be "Potassum" and "Magnesum"?? 🤣🤣 just kidding
You sounded a little like Nigerian when you said aluminium. The way Americans say that element was very weird to me at first.. totally different word 😆
Me: doesn’t know a lot of English and has always said Aluminium Also me: oh well who cares I’m still gonna say it like that cuz either way I’ll forget
ALUMINIUM is correct. In this case american english is just a dumb typo making it into official language
I love that he put the everybody hates Chris soundtrack in the end
Because they think they can just say shit and say it's the right way to say it. Arrogance.
Just cause it’s different doesn’t mean it’s strange, I could use this thought process for something else and get canceled…
When the english teacher starts teaching chemistry
America vs England spell war, while the rest of the world is enjoying both the spelling differences.
Aluminum... Americans be weird
So there is "Uranum and Newtonum" too???
If my teacher ask me i will answer METAL SIR!!
Cause they are strange
Us Americans spell it correct
u done this joke 8 times alrdy
BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER BO'OH'WA'ER
This is when we realise that american english and british english are completely different. I love being british. I can confuse people with these spellings.
Yeah, sad to see that this is actually true. There really IS an extra *i*, americans
No Americans don’t say strange things but every country have it own pronunciation , punctuation and spelling
So which one is the British one lol
elyuminyum.
Either america thinks they are better or that they are so dumb that they precieve everything wrong as right
Because Americans are obsessed with being different
Teacher: "There's no extra ah"
I'm Arabic and I spell it like that British guy
The correct way is Aluminum
If you ask me it's aluminium, and it's strange for me to say aluminum, without that extra 'i'
Aye no disrespect but in one video you mentioned its about perspective so in the US that is how they spell it in their “perspective” and before some people start commenting im american im mexican

I thinks it’s the other way around British people say it weird we say it how it look you guys say something comp different
I don't know if this is true, but I once heard that the British used to call aluminum, aluminium. But for some reason the stated calling it aluminium, at some point after America became independent.
U blame the teaching who taught students before they growing up.
There is a difference "Aluminum" and "Aluminiiiuuuuuuummmmmmmm"
Aluminum Aluminiuuummmmm
The only time I've EVER heard my maternal grandfather say the word "pussy" is when he was telling me about how women use it (Alum) to "tighten up", especially after cheating (as well as vinegar baths)🥴🤣🤣
🥲
Me who thought bread
The American Chemical Society (ACS) officially adopted *aluminum* in 1925 and in 1990 The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) accepted *aluminium* as the international scientific standard...so who is wrong now 😏
What you meant is "Why do British people spell this word so strangely?"
Is it weird that as an American, I can pronounce it the British way, but have trouble saying it the way most Aericans pronounce it
Something like This happen to me in real during my engineering 🙄🙄
Everybody Hates Chris
"Blimey cant beleive Americans call it soda and not the queens bubbly fizzy bottle poppers, bloody unbelievable"
It was because newspapers used to charge by the letter so they got rid of a few so often it stuck
The form aluminum is in common use in the United States; the form aluminium is used in Great Britain and by some chemists in the United States. ... And so we land today: with aluminum used by the English speakers of North America, and aluminium used everywhere else. Vamos a aprender inglés de lo más macizo
Ya me dejaron pensativo estos dos jaja 🤣. Aluminio mejor en español o usen el Latín 🔠
americans (of which i am one) will never know how to saw aluminium properly
he is saying how it’s spelled but pronouncing it wrong because….                                          Read more….                                              keep going…..                                                     your almost there!                                                   what you know about rolling down in the deep?        he is british and in america
So why not call helium helum or lithium lithum. Hell why stop at elements? Why not gymnasum or compendum
This generation complains about absolutely everything.
Americans don't realize that they are not speaking English they are speaking AMERICAN
the periodic table in my chemistry class actually has disclaimers that chemicals may be spelled differently in other places (aluminum, caesium, etc.)
We say it like we spell it
in German it's also called Aluminium
Alumunium
Just say: I'm British...
I have watched too much Dave has. I started to say aluminium now instead of aluminun
Idk why yall making shit up, a british man discovered aluminum from alum he named it aluminum pronounced as: a-loom-i-num but they didnt think think that was fancy enough and dubbed it aluminium against his wishes and yess i know there are others who extracted it first but he was the one attributing the most to its discovery
To be fair- they also pronounce it that way 😅
What American sounds like that I sure dont
Aluminum or aluminum come from the Greek word "αλουμίνιο" which is literally the pronation in English is aluminio . So they are both wrong in term of "being right" but every culture is different and they can call it however the fuck they want!! 😂
damnit, i said bread
It’s because Americans newspapers made ads pay per letter so companies would shorten words to save money
Americans say aluminum tho
Bruh why do brits spell it so weird
In the south we sat tin foil

Why do yall spell color as "colour" and pronounce it as "color"
I'm french. It is aluminium for me xD what's the big deal with that?
What I thought it had two I I have been spelling it wrong and no one told me? 😧🤦
Words like this we're shortened because of newspapers, the printers charged by the letter so they made this shorthand and it just kind of stuck
I say it right, the extra I at the end makes more sense.
Colour: C-O-L-O-U-R
You can’t say “Why do Americans spell it so strangely” Because Americans can say that right back to you about how you spell it.
Because in spanish is aluminio
This happens to me often
He’s lookin like kd
Aluminum is easier even my phone prefers it
Eliminating “extra” letters to make it cheaper for printing presses that charges by the letter, and we also wanted to be different from the Brits
???
To save cost on telegraph messages. That's how it all started.
They probably forgot it
In Germany we say "Aluminium" too 😂
Yeah they do
German word is Aluminium
America rEally wants to be different Don't they.    ( Don't sue me. Its just a joke.)
Aluminium is just the german spelling
"why Americans  spell this word so strangely"  Me an American: "which word?"  Also me: "yes"

Lol
I always wondered why you guys pronounce it differently. Well it's your language so you got it first.
Imagine asking for a rubber as a german
God damn Chewkz had like 30K subs about 4 months ago?! :D
Regardless of the origin of the word, aluminium somehow sounds and looks more correct. Aluminum seems like a common mistake that became the norm.
Americans are very particular to there English that's why it's a superpower
Here in Indonesia we call it "Alumunium"
Only America and Canada say aluminum. The rest of the world say aluminium and it was invented by an Austrian......sooooooo Americans and Canadians are wrong hahahha

I never knew aluminium was a word. Even my iPhone says it’s wrong and wants to correct it 🤣
Color or colour?
Lol, I've heard aluminium before but I NEVER confused it with aluminum 🤣
Have you tried not being born in an incorrect country?
Wait, so in english there are two different ways to say the same periodic element? Just when I was thinking European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese was different...

Americans discovered Aluminum iirc so I think we got you on this one.
The American revolution took so far that they butchered some English words too.
🤣😂🤣
Americans tries hard to be different from the rest of the world.. That's it
Because they are Americans.... They think to know everything.But they know shit
In India some people pronounce it as "ALMONIUM" 😂
It's because early American publishers thought it should match the pattern of platinum
In my country it's called "aluMINIUM" thankfully, the easiest and most natural word to remember 😂
You're teachers not wrong??😅
I live in america and I thought it was spelled aluminium
It’s cause we pronounce is differently so we had to spell it differently

Which idiot says aluminum how is it better for pronouncing... im serb btw
It's not strange..it's just plain wrong

Saran Wrap>Aluminum Foil for sandwiches

My country spells 'aluminium' too...
This entire channel runs on 'bottle of water' 😂
Ayo is this Walter black🤣🤣 Yo not trying to be racist here just making a joke about breaking bad
Bro when you did that old everybody hates chris show sound i felt that
I am Swedish/American and I have always thought it to be _aluminium_ and not "aluminum". Perhaps that is because we spell it as "aluminium" in Swedish as well.
Isn't it magnesium?
Love the reference at the end, "Everybody hatesss Chrisss" 藍藍藍藍藍

Yeah ikr, why is it Uranium not Uranum then? What about titanium? Polonium? Francium? Helium?

Aluminum or Aluminium both register correct on my autocorrect.
Yes I answered it right🤘🤘
In Poland it's aluminium. Lol
Americans are very smart. They can do anything, and justify it so nicely that it becomes the right thing.
"Aluminum" sounds like a child that struggles to pronounce a word too long for him 😂
Aluminum

“Why these American teachers always fucking with me, we’re the same colour”   🤨
Sorry sorry WHAT THE FREAK OS 13 WMELENTS I THOUGHT IT WAS 4
Because they use simplified English
A luu me ni um
Aluminum, who tf says Aluminium
Alooominoom
The form aluminum is in common use in the United States; the form aluminium is used in Great Britain and by some chemists in the United States. And so we land today: with aluminum used by the English speakers of North America, and aluminium used everywhere else.
Its not wierd its just difrent
American words are spelt shorted because the printing press was expensive to to save time and money they would just shorten words.
I’m just gonna explain this. The man who found this names it amuminium but Americans changed it so it sounded like most other elements. Oxygen, nitrogen and aluminium. Doesn’t sound as good as aluminum. So aluminium is actually correct.
US newspapers got rid of a lot of letters deemed extra to save money on printing
Aluminiuminiuminium
It’s Aluminium in Europe and Aluminum in the US, however still the same element 😜
Simon adebisi
Believe it, “Aluminum” is actually the correct pronunciation. “Aluminium” has an extra “i” in it because the British wanted it to be similar to a lot of other elements that ended in “-ium”
In Spanish have that extra" i"
And thats why Chemists use the periodic table 😂
In german it is aluminium
Actually "Alumunium." Is also how us Indonesians pronounce and also writes/spell lol
American English is the equivalent to washing your hands after a shower
Aluminio
Is it only in india or all Asians say ALUMINIUM?
We need a new Fred the fish! 🐠
Being American I can say that America messed the English language
British people say the letter H like they've horribly mispronounced hatch
Shouldn't it be "Alumunium?
Aluminium.
Same like a=american b=british A=color favorite B=colour favourite
Thats just racist at thqt point im russian who grew up learning british english but also grew up watching american youtubers and so i sometime say the same word differently f
Who wraps their sandwiches in Aluminum?
i’m glad my chem teacher doesn’t force memorization down our throats
Ah-loo-mih-num that's why theres no extra i
The spellings are both correct. Each from different dictionaries. American dictionary and English dictionary. Nothing new
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I thought it is Alumininininium.
Teacher: "You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches"  My confused ass: "Bread"

I'm American and say it the British way LOL
I prefer aluminium
After watching this I had trouble saying  aluminum
Well the proper scientific term is aluminum, and it doesn't matter what your accent is. It's aluminum but Bri'ish people say it wierd asf
This is funny, but the title is a bit weird, it's not spelled strangely because Americans pronounce it like that so it's more so just different ways of saying it, but still great video, better than my videos for sure
I'm not even American and I spell it like that, because it's not even English in the first place
Is it not Aluminium?
This is true ngl. My whole life i thought the only spelling was aluminium
Why did the worlds greatest super power in the 1700s lose to farmers with some cannons
The reason some words are spelled differently in America is because capitalism. It cost more money to print more letters, so stuff got cut out to save small amounts of money.
Wow
Shit favorite to
I JUST REALIZED THERES NO EXTRA "I" WHAT
Just watch Michael McLyntyre's bit on American words, basically takes it out of them for it
Capitalism, Americans cut out certain letters to save ink on printing presses.
Nie to jest amelinium Krzychu nie pomalujesz bo to amilenowe
Funny enough, I prefer the British version of Aluminum, because it is easier to say for me.
Man you grew so fast in such a short time!
Cause we're retarded
Uh, who tf in america says aluminium bruh it's aluminum
Wait- I'm american and I thought it was aluminum... wtf am I weird?
After watching this video I'm about to hit my crewmates in the face with some aluminium
The real throw off is a black guy teaching science and bio
I change the way I pronounce it from time to time
We dont
The Americans take letters off because they're lazy af
The better question is: why do European people still bother with the extra 'i' when it takes more time. Language is about communicating ideas as fast and efficiently as possible. But it really doesn't matter at the end of the day, spell it how you want. You're still communicating the same idea at the end of the day and anyone that gets upset over it is just being pedantic.
Spell Island  Me: iland  English: no  Me: what you mean no  English: you forgot the s  Me: what s I dont hear no s  English: it's silent  Me: what the literal fuck if it's silent why the fuck is it even there English: idk
Brits like the extra letters in their spelling. "Colour"; "Favour", etc
Aluminium isn’t the 13th element tho so he need help
Eminem lite= aluminum
I personally pronounce it the way the teacher does, but I dont get annoyed when people say it aluminium. Autocorrect doesn't even understand  the cultural difference. It kept correcting it to the American one.
Just to throw it back at ya: colour, centre, theatre, aeroplane, cheque
Shut the english spell color like colour. This is a joke chill y’all
In Brazil it's Alumínio, so, British peeps, you aren't alone... Americans and their weird different words 🙄😆
Ive called it aluminium ever since I was a kid and Im Indonesian Which one is right? why are words confusing man
Don't be British
Alumulumunnium what?
I don’t think it’s spelled aluminum anywhere I thought it was just the pronunciation that changes
Bruh Americans say it as 'aluminum'. While we asians call it 'aluminium' bc my Science teacher told me it was 'aluminium' 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️
In the 1940s there were two cities who insisted we spelled it their way too.. I present Hiroshima and Nagisaki
Rip... *I said plastic wrap---*
This reminds me so much of my friend; My friend always tries to outsmart me and then he always get outsmarted by me which I'm not really the smartest
Technically it was correctly pronounced the way that Americans say it but the creator when he presented it to the uk he didn’t like the way it was said he changed it when presenting to the people of the uk
“Why do Americans spell this word so weird!”   Meanwhile the I just being left out
Why was I thinking the word was gonna be tortillas because .. oh wait I just realized as I’m typing this you don’t wrap a whole samich in a tortilla  Freaking dumb ahss
Bruh wutever happs but isnt peridic table elements something that cant be altered by everyday talk
We say it the normal way too. We just had to make things harder for our selves
Bro it’s always been aluminum that’s what my autocorrect says
I hate to admit but the word aluminum was named by a British scientist, so it is indeed Britain who calls it wrong, being British this hurt to find out, but it is true....
Das racist
This is why most Britishers won't be able to clear the computer-based exams in the United States if they take them, it's not like they're wrong, it's just that the computer will only take one spelling as an answer, whichever one the teacher puts in
I learned aluminium first then we moved to a different country and its aluminum here
I think it aluminum
I pronounce it like Aluminum but I thought it was spelt Aluminium -
Everybody haaaayes chris!
Why can’t the British spell things weird
I have a friend like this and we were playing a game and he got mad and said bloody and I said why does the tractor have to be bloody
Their teachers: "Wrong and spelled wrong."  My teachers: "I don't care how you spell it, as long as I understand what you wrote."
Because of capitalism
I got bullied once for pronouncing it like that once
Because USA are more dumber than the uk
Me thinking of plastic lol
wtf is aluminium
It's aluminium
In Canada we spell it with the extra "i" on the periodic table.
It’s you guys that spell weird 👁👄👁
F* k that aluminum
I’m American and I seems normal to me like why y’all add and extra i
If it's an American College it would be correct to say Aluminum
Idk why we say it and spell it like rha
You mean why do we spell it so good shut up British "people"
As an American its relatable 😂
as an American, ive never heard someone pronounce Aluminium or even spell it that way
A good self defense response: Atleast, I now know chemistry 🤷🏽‍♀️
Me: An American who has never seen Aluminum spelled like Aluminium. *Ultimate confusion*
We have aluminum as in the foil but the element is aluminium
Just so it is shorter, you know us americans are lazy right lmao😂
Why are British people addin all these extra letters smh  *this is a joke*
I’m still gonna say it aluminium
Macaroni
We spell it like that???
In Russian it's literally "алюминиум - aluminium" so that's why I thought it spells like that before. (I'm in Canada though, not America)
A man of high grammatical honour.
I thought aluminum was the 17th element
When someone British comes up in class
As a Canadian, I get confused a lot when people say aluminium and not aluminum
Because we kicked the Brits’ @ss?
Aluminiuminum
Aluminum is the original though?
for NIKE they be like its NIKEEEE.... 😐 what about the other words like 'BIKE' and 'LIKE'😶😶
No why do british people spell words wrong
Is this British class or something?
It is what it is Chewkz.
Nah yall pronounce it weird not us
When the English level of the whole country is too low they decided to have their own version of dictionary
Me being in India where people use some British and some American: 👁💧👄💧👁
we don’t spell words weirdly, we did it differently to better fit our different accent
My question is... who tf wraps their sandwiches in aluminum
Yeah I find this so strange because so many elements end in "ium" but aluminum doesn't. I can't quite remember why this is but I think it was something similar to a mistranslation
bruh im american but i physically cannot comprehend words unless i read it at least twice so i be saying words the british way on the daily😭😭
As an American,i can say it’s not spelled weird.   It’s just that when you don’t grow up knowing the word,that’s what makes it seem weird
Why do british people say it so weird
“Day Vision” by Vastral Nihil 🔥 🍀 https://youtu.be/MiHdYT4uOWg #undergroundhiphop #rap #flows #undergroundrap #lofihiphop
I don't know if you're British or American Someone help!!!!!
I'm American born in America and I say aluminium not aluminum
This also includes congradulations so we say congrats
Canada also uses Aluminum so, yeah. Fuck you.
Bro I only know the 7th element     Ha-ha-ha
I thought they were two different things lol
I always thought it was pronounced Aluminum and spelt Aluminium
That's so funny because the way you said it first is how I said it for the first 25 years of my life lol
The answer is that people where charged by the letter to print in the press/newspapers so the publishers in the states started retracting letters that seemed unnecessary this the divide between Brit English and “American” English as people got accustomed to the new spellings
People talking bout cultural differences but considering Americans made the word we choose how to spell it so saying it wrong is fine but at least spell it correctly when saying it
Basically, the British called it aluminium, and the British began colonizing America. Then, America split off and were like "Nah, not this, I don't like this anymore." And now we have the shitty measuring system as well as different words.
We're American, most of us are born with an extra bone called the dumbass bone that limits brain capacity. It's a problem that has plagued our country recently and is causing people with common sense to go extinct
I mean it’s not that different it’s just one letter but pronunciation is different.
I'm American and I never knew this I always thought it was Aluminium..
Dont ask questions, because when u on top of the world ,u decide what is right and wrong lol jk.  I didn't know this one actually
Its only strange to and some other people america 🇺🇸 and the uk are different
why you make the word extra complicated like you sound weird asf
The teacher should get some extra lessons since aluminium is the latin word of aluminum.
Wym I always say it as aluminum, wait I’m not American
If there's a teacher that really would do this they probably wouldn't get past a first grade level of teaching
Never has there ever been a more controversial word besides the n word.
Damn I’m confused
What about tinfoil
Hears *13 element*, messes it up with the 7th element, still get flashbacks.  *Ia prishol dati atu pesniu, ahahahahahahahah blblblblblblbll ahahahahahahhahaha*
I was just raised the American way
Not me thinking it was tin cause I call aluminum tin foil T-T
I would just not go
7th element is: best song
I pronounce it aloominum
I think you need to know more about cultural differences-_-
Turns out they’re both right. Aluminum (no extra I) is preferred in the US and Canada. Aluminium (extra I) is preferred in the UK and Australia. The North American version is more popular, however, since there are more American companies and media outlets than there are British and Australian.
Why you spell it so weird tho, wtf is Aluminium, sounds Spanish or sum shit
The only country in  the world to use the term 'aluminum' is America. Everywhere else calls it aluminium.
Yeah no
The real question is Why do u guys always judge us for being different?
I have never heard a American produce it like that
Aluminium was french for bedrock on Minecraft ps3
Comment
I was gonna say cellophane but aluminum is also correct
We had to be edgy

Aren’t you supposed to wrap a sandwich on plastic wrap?
It was originally aluminum, not aluminium
And I have been calling it aluminium for all my life lol. Even in exams I used to write aluminium and even my teachers used to tell aluminium.
I’m an American, I spell aluminium like this, this is so relatable
American spelling is the same as putting a V12 engine in a wooden toy car. It just doesn't make sense and is just plain dumb
As an American I hate how we spell things
The only word I can’t pronounce either 👍🤙
Why does everyone always study Americans while we couldnt care less about their lame countries?
But in my country it is "alumunium"
I say Aluminium. even though I'm American. it just sounds better.
Aluminium is an incorrect way to spell it but they insist on saying it it’s the accent I guess
As an American I can agree.
Im not eben americsn and i know its aluminium, like you dont say uranum you say uranium so goes for aluminium
I, as an American, have never seen aluminum spelled that way. It even gets autocorrected.
Wym? Brits are the one who say it weird. We say it how it's spelled
What about ethen??
Who wraps sandwhiches in aluminum? Sandwhich bags exist
Bruh to us. You spelling it weird
As an Italian and kinda Latin-speaker I need to support the British guy position. It is "Aluminium" with the extra "i". Because it comes from latin and it is spelled the same in latin: Aluminium  ălūmĭn|ium  And it is like this in the nominative, accusative and vocative cases
Even though I’m British I think the American way sounds better JUST this one time
I’m American and I’ve always said it and pronounced it as aluminum not “aluminium”
Sir Humphrey Davy, who named the element, first proposed _alumium_ (a-loo-me-um).
Well considering they refused to use the metric system aluminium is the least of worries
Americans really
Me who is American and pronounces it aluminum: /:
Me as a Brazilian: "Ive been trough that"
"Sir Humphry made a bit of a mess of naming this new element, at first spelling it alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum, and finally settling on aluminium in 1812."  My thoughts:  If we took it to a democratic vote on the correct way to pronounce it, the U.S./Canada pronunciation would win by a landslide.  There are 97 million English speakers in the U.K., New Zealand and Australia, while there are a total of 366 million English speakers in the U.S. and Canada.
Brits: Americans pronounce it weird Americans: Brits pronounce it weird Me: visible confusion
Bro I’m more confused that people wrap the sandwich’s in aluminum like I use paper or I put in a plastic bag if it’s small
Who the hell is wrappibg their sandwich with aluminum foil???
Guys who say tin-foil: *confused noises*
If we’re doing away with extraneous i’s, let’s call #11 Sodum.

Don't get me started with theater or theatre.
You look like Kevin hart sometimes 😂
I had a dream about you with a full sketch-I can only imagine what it must of looked like if there was a device to record dreams!!!!!
Me who is American, aluminium, what?? It's Aluminum.
Most of the time America is in the wrong, but this time aluminum was actually spelled a l u m i n u m by the first person that discovered it
Aleluya! Gloria a Dios!!! Saludos desde COREA!~~
It's a matter of British vs American English. It's aluminium in the UK and aluminum in the US. Separated by a common language...
Always make me laugh - thank you!

So Aluminium is British and Aluminum is American
I know that this is a joke but there are still people that argue about this seriously it’s just one word why can’t we understand that different parts of the world have different accents and pronounce words differently and it’s not like you can’t understand somebody if the pronounce it differently
Something something, chemical was found by the guy who named in Aluminum, but everywhere else calls it Aliminium because ium is a element designator
It used to be called aluminum but it was changed to aluminium. I guess the Americans didn’t wanna change it 🤷‍♂️
DAT BOY NED JESUS. I mean the teacher.
I wanna know if this guy is either American or British 😭
Aluminium sounds dumbaf
Because in 1812 the Brits thought it didn't sound enough like other metals (Sodium, Potassium, etc.).  "Aluminium, for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound. " [Quarterly Review, September 1812]. Before Sir Humphrey Davy changed his mind on spelling he had originally called it Alumium in 1808.
But is the dress white and gold or blue and black?
"Seen the machine That cut aluminum clean And got tape from the caution sign" - Jack White III. Listen to "Broken Bricks" song by The White Stripes, that's quite repetable you'll learn the word soon!)
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
Y’all the ones who say and spell it weirdly not us! Lol
I loughed more than I should have
some american out there prob said the word wrong and now everyone's vocabulary fucked up 'cause of em
Good bro
Aluminum was the original name.  The Brits changed the spelling to aluminium so it matched other elements.
In 3rd grade I had a friend from France. I remember one time being on the playground and him saying aluminium just like you said there. I was confused but shrugged it off thinking he wasn’t fluent enough in English to pronounce it correctly. Today I finally figured out what he meant. He was saying a correct version of it
https://youtu.be/DdmNYNkcwKE ,,
Aluminium in the UK and several other English speaking countries. Aluminum in the USA....for anyone wondering.
Huh i didn't know it was with an i, my whole life was a lie
Keep it up bro lol they gonna audition you to do an American role, you too fluent in the accent 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
I'm American and I've never struggled saying aluminum
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
That is kinda confusing, yes. In Germany we use the etra "i"
This question is so easy
your calling is strange
Why do British say it that way and think it’s right😂😂😂🤡

Google razorwraith 👹🌑🌋👻🌍🌚🌛🌜🌹☄️😈🤘🏾☠️🌐
i find it funny that the caption says "why do Americans spell this so weird".  the element name itself actually changed, so the way an American would spell it is technically correct. However, English people also spell it this way and in their version of the language it's also correct. 🤷🏻‍♂️ but either way I'm not sure why people have such a problem with this word either way it's spelled lmao
Bro, “America” is the continent, the people who u talk about is  “U.S.”  If you talk about “americans”  you mean Mexicans, Ecuatorians, Argentines, Chileans, etc…  the U.S. Are not owners of the continet…
https://youtu.be/AShFzgJ5gbE
Teacher is more ignorant than a random internet user
It’s the same thing when Americans spell Favour. They leave out the u. Like we Nigerians are confused why there’s no u in Favour
TIL how America pronounced this word and I live in it
Idk why we are so weird
In Russia we say Alyuminiy
You can find it weird that America has a different measurement system, but language is far more flexible and saying any one answer is correct is a lost cause, especially when every nation has its own dialects. Just look at Australia, many words that are nonsense anywhere else but make perfect sense to an Australian even though at the end of the day they are still speaking English
The reason why, is that the British spelled it wrong so they say it wrong
Fun fact the chemistry industry forced America to use aluminium in exchange the rest of the world to spell sulfur with and f instead a ph
It's uranium y'all are weird
Im weak bruhs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DAMN UT I WAS SO CLOSE SILICON IS 14
Silicon
It’s actually super right
The same case as colour and color
I'm pretty sure the element has the extra I but Aluminum isn't the element

How you pronounce it in British English is actually the right way since Aluminium comes from Latin and in Latin you read all letters without skipping some just because you feel like it, like in American English. Another example: many Americans call me Mila, but my name is actually Milena. Like, where did the other two letters go?
Me with dyslexia: 😲
Does sodder contain aluminum?
Aluminium is correct in Indonesia language (I'm from Indonesia)
How do Americans say it… it sounds sooo WEIRD!
i just love how this probably is a university and they r asking 6th grade questions      *i swear to god dont whoosh me*

Aluminimum
That and when people say "nukular" (nuclear)
The everybody hates Chris transition music tho
Well, in France it's Aluminium, and this word probably comes from latin which is the base of French soooo why did American people deleted the i?
By the way, we spell it correctly but we may ‘pronounce’ it wrong. 😂🤣 that extra ‘i’ is definitely  silent.
scientists: _"and here we have Aluminium"_ murica': _"aloominoo!"_ scientists: O_o
when I spell aluminium I say it to myself like that.
and the dumbass me thought it was Alumunium
I prenounce it in a British accent for some odd reason
I honestly say it the British way also 69k ‘nice’
Since the British are their forefathers technically they should be listening to their daddy 😁
One day they might "realise" that
I'm usually use the Brits one for this thing
Alumunium?
Why was my first reaction a confident “SARAN WRAP”
the US doesn't even get measurements straight
America a different world 🤭
Youre the ones who spell it weird In spanish its more similar to US
We say "Aluminium" too in France
Both are right answers. The guy who named it put both.
*sidewalk* road
This was years ago, but I saw an actual English dictionary from the UK and the word is spelled inside of it ALUMINUM. No extra letter I, and that came from a European dictionary.
"Soldering"
Omg I say it the same way and I would always get corrected but I thought it was because of my Spanish accent lol
taRumlÜg  Programmierer der Master K. I.     ....

imma stick with aluminum 😅
Even though am not British were i live we pronounce it like British does with an extra i
????????
Cause we are right bitch
Oh thank you!!! This bugs me to no end while watching American films/series. Also Turmeric, Americans pronounce it as "tumouric"
British spelling and US spelling. They are both right.
Aluminij for me 🤣
We did all the science. We also get to name other things, like the internet and nuclear bomb.
Its prouncouned Al UUM UN IM
Alooominum
It's Aluminium
Okay so the reason it’s spelt so weird is because newspapers charge by the letter so certain letters were actually removed from words (u in colour and the I in Aluminium for example) and they just kinda stuck around.
this is so stupid
"everybody hates Chris"
Germans also say Aluminium
When it was discovered the scientist named it "Aluminum" but some soggy cunts peer pressured him into changing it to have an extra i so it would sound more like other elements (calcium, sodium, magnesium, etc.) The American pronunciation is the original way to say it, so that means you guys are technically the ones who spell it strangely 😂
Aluminum sounds strange ;_; Aluminium sounds natural for some reason.
It’s not spelt strange it’s spelt on how it’s said in America and the way you spell it is different
Ask British and American people to spell color 😁
Tf in Belgium it's also aluminium
But in Poland is correct word ...
I love your content Its so funny And all i wanted to say was "bottle of water" Now u say it!
Americans seem to love either changing or removing letters from words.
Aluminium 🇸🇪
Its aluminium period.
Wtf is aluminum? I'm confused
Man how they say caramel like CAR Mall is so weird
haha..lmao...
i had a strong sense aluminium is how most country say it, US stuttered on that one
I don't understand why people think its so weird America spells Aluminum differently. It makes perfect sense to me, United States a different country therefore could have different spellings.
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. (Wikipedia)
In Germany we say Aluminium too.
I'm bad at British accent so don't get mad when I use it
Americans just want to be different and still consider themselves correct 🤣
Well he is kinda right tho, in my language its spelled Aluminium
The "see me after class, you're gonna need extra help" OOF I felt that.... 😔
I swear British words are just words you use in a wizard battle
In Germany it's aluminium
Aluminum vs Aluminium
أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ﴾  Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"  Translated From Quran
Ngl Aluminium sounds way cooler
Indian accent be like: Aloo-mini-yam
Bro
Because they're lazy
Why do people not know that the british version came second
Why do Americans make fun of people speaking English the in UK when the British literally invented the language, we should all be making fun of America cause they got their English of wish
"Probably use this to wrap your sandwiches"  Me: CLINGFILM      (I don't like sandwiches lol)
French people say it like that too
Boi
If there is one thing I’ve learned from these videos is that his pronunciations are right, because, those Europeans, we use their language. We just changed it up. So its not them that has a “weird” language… Its us.
Wth America
Tbh brits would probably say tin foil
I afraid I’m a little confused that you guys are using aluminum wrap the sandwiches?
haha... In Bangladesh we also spell Aluminium
Its how you spell it in dutch though
Oh yeah? Well why do you call it an oven if you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food?
Noah Webster is credited with changing the spelling of so many words. He felt that the U.S.A. being free from Britain needed its own English spelling of words. He believed that English spelling rules were ridiculous, so for his dictionary spelling he replaces words like "colour" with "color", or "theatre" for "theater".  American English spellings by Webster were first printed in his dictionary in 1828 along with many other new American words that didn't exist in Britain at all.  Australia has many similar ideas but they still clung to British spelling for the most part. But they seem be more flexible or accept other spellings. For example Oz prefers -our endings, yet the "Australian Labor Party" does not have the -our spelling in it.  There were some spellings Webster tried to introduce that didn't quite make it. For example "women" would have been "wimmen", "ache" would be "ake", and "sponge" would have been "spunge".
This is aluminum u cant paint this shit
Meanwhile in Indonesia, we say Alumunium 😂
Every other nation out there has their own way of interpreting the Periodic Table…why is it weird for America to have their own way of spelling and pronouncing?  (Gold and Silver are completely different words in other languages and that’s mentioned but not enforced. Rightfully so.)
im cunfuzled
Meanwhile indonesian : *Alumunium*
Bro tf out here in America really thinking it was Alumin-IUM
oo
Lol
I was once a imposter
As an Indian both feel correct
In portuguese it's "alumínio"
Na aluminum is like the only improvement we made in the US 🤣
Wait, its Aluminum all these time?

Wait its Bread.

Im Asian and most of us spell Aluminum as Aluminium and we still assumed Alumunium is the right one...
chemistry class to spelling bee😂
Well a danish man discovered it. So both are correct respectively. Since nobody likes the danish.
Aluminum. It doesn't auto correct it to Aluminium.
Fun opinion that I’m free to give: your content sucks it’s not funny 😂
АЛЮМИНИЙ, БЛЯ.

It's in Webster as aluminum not aluminium so the Brits are wrong
''Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds
no cuz my dumbass said plastic-
aluminio
while the rest of the world spell aluminium..
Ummm..who spells aluminum? Not aluminium?..and I never use the word and auto correct tried to correct me...
In his defense (defence?!?), many elements end in "IUM."
The ending made laugh so loud!
I use it interchangeably. And I’m not sure why
It's not strange
Don’t ask me. I don’t know why they spell it like that- I’m just a Brit that gets made fun of for my accent at an American school..
😆
in Indonesian, we call it Alumunium
I don't understand either and I'm American
God loves you so much 💕💕
God loves you so much 💕💕
Now I want to hear someone from the UK say “aluminum”
Everybody hates Chris omg I watched that show so many times like 23 times it is so good
It's because our language is weird
Bruhhhhh what? Americans really spell it like aluminum?!?! I thought it was always aluminium
Interesting fact here:  The reason so many words in American English have less letters is because back in the olden days around the 18th to 19th centuries printing companies would charge you based on how many letters there were on the page. To cheese the system American newspapers started dropping “unnecessary” letters. If you read a paper and saw “Armor” instead of “Armour” you would still understand what the word was.
If you pronounce it like -nium, you just being dramatic
Fuck you. Why do brits spell it weird?
It’s actually about the Hall–Héroult process😂when Hall got famous for adding Na3AlF6 to the process of aluminium production at that time he had a typo when writing it down and then all Americans followed suit
In herb...there's a fucking h in start👁👄👁
Isn't that what the periodic table is for so that we Don't have to memorise all the god damn elements
As an american it always makes me laugh to hear my buddy from australia say aluminum.😂
Facts, why is it pronounced like that, they just gonna not pronounce ium
Thats true in here
Aluminium i swear its aluminium
The form aluminum is in common use in the United States; the form aluminium is used in Great Britain and by some chemists in the United States. ... And so we land today: with aluminum used by the English speakers of North America, and aluminium used everywhere else. So it's clear who needed to improve
‘Why do Britains pronounce this word so strangely?’

Say a bottle of water bro
Meanwhile in Indonesia... Almunium or Alumunium 😂😂😂
Bri’ish “people” be like:
Bro, we get it, American language and spelling is stupid. We knew this before you even started making videos on it
Americans would say Aluminium in a different way. Ngl but every language is odd in some sort of way.
I think they made the word using the "latim", then, when you will spell it, you just say like a Mexican or Brasilian boy
To be fair, according to the etymology, it was the Brits that screwed up the spelling of aluminum.   One of those rare times where the American spelling is correct.

Wtf. My is life a lie 💀
Really, I never heard of Aluminum
these great verbal scuffles :) I liked the guy
We in the netherlands spell Aluminium
Well i was curious so I looked it up. Kinda interesting. Basically English chemist discovered it and named it aluminum but then other chemists were like "you should change it to aluminium so that it's like sodium, potassium" and he agreed and the change was quickly adjusted everywhere but the Americas so that's why it's so different
Why do Americans spell School  S-H-O-O-T-I-N-G R-A-N-G-E
Fwiw, the guy who discovered the element (a British guy) called it "Aluminum". The extra i was added when the British decided to change pronunciation to sound more posh than those filthy, unrefined rebels across the Atlantic.
Because every thing had to be extra over here
Alu-WHAT
They do this because of capitalism
Shoppe shop
My wife is from Ireland and we go back and forth over the spelling and pronunciation of the word aluminum.  Its great fun.
LOL
Sir Humphry was not immediately decisive about the name, initially spelling it alumium in 1807. He then changed it to aluminum, and finally settled on aluminium in 1812. So its the americans are WRONG
In India we call it aluminium 😶😶
Had a British chemistry teacher in high school. Eventually he converted to saying Aluminium the American way. Twas a great victory for the class.
well your use to different language idiot
I’ve always wondered why a ton of the elements ended with “ium” but not aluminum. I thought that was so weird. Now it turns out that in Britain you do spell it with “ium” at the end? It makes a ton more sense now. (The US is weird)
You cant tell who 10 lost tribes is because Ishmael Ham.laws. Going pits
This used to piss me off in my chemistry class for those who used the word “aluminium” instead of “aluminum” the true difference is being in America versus being in the UK. all I gotta say is those who said “Aluminium” were snobs who fought over gpas so I’ll just let that sit in
Aluminum, yea that's the correct way to say it.
Briish actually mispronounce it. But good effort
Me : 'Plastic' Him : 'aluminum' Me : 👁️👄👁️

Bro sometimes I forgets how to speak fluent American
I got this is class today. I said aluminium, and got a look. I guess it comes with being British in Canada

"Instert the Good Place reference here"

The same reason why Gas Station (US) is called Servo (Australia) and Petrol Station (UK); they’re different countries with different ways to spell/pronounce different words and that’s one of the best parts about learning different cultures. Im surprised how anyone is confused by this seriously judging by these comments. Whew
I'm not even American but we call it aluminum. Maybe aluminium is just a British thing.

I can't believe English people think that English has been invented by the English people! everybody knows it was invented by Americans!!! Then we had to go, and invent all the other languages for all the other countries because they was just making random grunting noises before that! we helped them out, and assigned them a language to their country. You're welcome world. 🗽🇺🇲
It’s just to be different. I’m not sure myself
I mess up my words
That ending though. ☠️
even in spanish is “aluminio”
Fun Fact : Aluminium is in British and Aluminum is in American English
When aluminium was discovered and named, the document they sent over to the US had a typo where the second "i" was missing. That's why we call it aluminum. Edit: This is not entirely true, I have decided to write what actually happened in the comment section
Same thing as Latin Spanish and Spain Spanish
In Germany we Actually say Aluminium
Jesus is king
Wait, now I'm confused
When you get it before the hint
I use both I use aluminum for my parents and aluminium for smart people

In my language it's spelled with 2 i's lol
If you claim to be Christians but deny Jesus with your sinful life your going to hell.He died and rose again for you to be saved not to sin all you want . Luke 13:3 the Bible says to repent or you’ll perish. Lukewarm Christians don’t go to heaven Revelation 3:16. REPENT THIS SECOND TOMORROW ISN’T PROMISED YOU DID NOT SEE THIS ON ACCIDENT.
This literally happen today in class!!
Yall are the ones that spell it weird
Bruh, even in Brazil we spell "Alumínio = Aluminium"... Why americans, why?
I like aluminum better, both the way it's said and written.  English is my third language so I'd consider myself relatively unbiased
13th element : Brrrrrra a aaaa~
Like the word colour and color lol
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
It just be that way
"Everybody haatees Chris. yeeaaahh!"
It might have to do with the tax per letter thing that used to happen

Sad because the etimology "aluminium" has the extra i
Yh icl Americans are built different

Im an American I agree a lot of our world are just plain stupid
How’d you spell it that fast 👁👄👁
Why do British people say and spell that word so weird?
Me an American that didn’t know how to spell it (I still can’t spell so-)
Thats beard is Mystical
Yank can't use proper English.
Remember you’re the one who founded us so it’s your fault
Aluminum is literally in the autocorrect
Some here miss the joke I guess. British and American language is  "English" but nevertheless they don't understand proberly sometimes. It's just funny...don't know why some don't get it🙈😂😅
Hiiii
For some  reason  I  just noticed that  the  British English is closer to the French language  we do write a tons of things exactly the same way. Maybe cause there was a French king in  England  centuries ago
0:02
hate to break it ,but he is in chemistry lab but he put the maths problem on the board in the background. No hard feelings uwu
Just stop being gay
Him: why do Americans spell aluminium so weird Americans: why does he spell aluminum weird
Fun fact: Although the discoverer was British, in his own book he used the American spelling. The British spelling is actually came second because British people found the modified version easier to pronounce. Therefore yall are the ones spelling it weird.
The correct forum is aluminium, aluminum is the mineral not the element
me an American: idk we’re stupid like that
I was taught to recognize it both ways. Anybody who knows what they’re talking about wouldn’t even distinguish between the two
actually in polish it is aluminium
Why blame Americans??? It’s literally how the words spelt.
It’s not fucking aluminium look at the fucking periodic table idiot. Even your iPhone says you’re spelling it wrong😂💀
In Spanish is "aluminio".
Poo
Idk
Americans discovered ot, they choose the pronunciation
Here is my argument go look at all the other  elements magnesium, Germanium, lithium, Selenium they all sound the same in American English then we get to "Aluminum" which is actually spelled Aluminium on the Elements Table and we say it differently ...THEN ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT END IN "IUM" WTF? It makes no damn sense
Me as an American has never heard anyone say aluminum like that lol.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought it was spelt aluminium but pronounced aluminum
I've never heard anyone say it like that, its always been aluminum
Seriously the right way to pronounce aluminium is british
to je amelinium, nie pomalujesz
Aluminum Uhh it's Europe that's doing it wrong lol
Me who says Aluminum and not aluminium why do people say aluminium????
When English isn’t your strong suit lol 😂
I've never called it aluminium...
The IUPAC has determined either spelling is correct and acceptable. However, the accepted spelling in North America is aluminum, while the accepted spelling just about everywhere else is aluminium.
Both are wrong. Its originally Alum or Alumina.  Long history short, the british mispronounced it and then the americans mispelled it.
I thought it was spelled aluminium
In spanish is "Aluminio" and I always forgot that in English is a bit more different
Who thought "I didn't know clingfilm was an element"
Brits and their weird pronunciation
British struggles👏✨
Aluminium in french is spell "Aluminium"
A-loo-mi-num. not Al-oo-min-ium
Chewsday
Came from a country once colonised by British... it's always 'aluminium' never 'aluminum'.
America is a continent 🙄
Ill never understand why the British and US have different pronunciations of this word
No you said something else
... uhm..... The Americans are more right, the British doesn't have to put an extra few characters
Hhaahahaha
In Australia we say aluminium too 🤣🤣
Shit normal asf lol you just dyslexic or sum lol
Hahahaha, everybody hates chris. Thats my show
Americans and their silly words and measurements
Not strangely, just different, besides our way of spelling it is shorter by one letter haha, god I love our random conveniences
We spell it how we pronounce it
As a fellow ethan...I'm that they got the question right 😂
I said Saran Wrap-
its alluminium in latin, i was so confused
It is aluminum tho and every school in america spells it that way too lol
I thought he was trick williams, the new guy on nxt 😂
Props to being  able to spell that
We spell it likes its said
I have never heard anyone say “aluminium”
Pop
I think your confused on who spells it weird
As an American,  I CANNOT pronounce aluminum. I actually have to use the British pronunciation to say it.
So the reason why the Americans have a different spelling is, back in the day when news papers were printed, they payed per word, thus taking away some letters. i.e. Colour and Color
Aluminium
like anyways instead of anyway lol
The first one is the correct pronunciation for Aluminum. I def. learned this when I was in my first year in college in my inorganic chem class. We were really shocked at that time becoz we thought the second pronunciation is correct. I think it is only applicable in chem-related courses?
Leviticus 23:33-36 The Feast of Tabernacles Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a sacred[a] assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it. Enjoy the upcoming Feast of Tabernacles. Shalom.
So confused isn’t it aluminum? Is this saying it’s actually spell different in America or people spell it wrong
Yooo his American accents are on point!
Racing
In german its Aluminium
“See me after class, you need extra help”   🤣🤣😩 if a teacher said that to me I’m dropping out
In portuguese we say alumínio  So for brazilians trying to learn english the confusion is way easier
Aluminium is actually the correct spelling with the extra “I”… It falls into other category elements ending in ium. Lithium, thallium, radium etc. It’s a metal..
Fun fact. We Germans spell ist Aluminium too
Just don't be British. Ez.
The British way just sounds weird plus there’s other elements with the same sounding ending
This happend I school today
The reason Americans say Aluminium like this is because in Britain someone spelt Aluminium wrong on the box of Aluminium that was being shipped to America.
European here. We spell it aluminium
The British accent is a speech impediment
Growing up with mostly British English and then coming to study in the USA! I can totally relate especially with Chemistry 😂
It's Aluminum. Stop playing
in europe,as human we call it aluminium, in other land other creatures call it aluminum
Do they also say calcum? Or Potassum? No? Then learn to spell Aluminium.
Every body ha~ates chewkz.
My dumbass out here saying tin.
American are just hopeless. Why would anyone say aluminum??
In Germany we also say Aluminium
WAIT THEY ACTUALLY SPELL IT DIFFERENTLY TOO the weirdos 😟
We just say hliník Done easy
Khaby lame and chewkz collab much needed
You can say aluminium but you’d be wrong
Ye we're weird af
The periodic table says Aluminium.  America has to fuck everything up
Americans are just still set on war and weapons being what makes them supreme, like people did back in the 1600's
I am more used to say aluminium becasue in spanish it's aluminio and my tonge is used to it 😂
Why do we spell it differently? Can we leave the elements alone at least😂
man, in brazilian portuguese is "Alumínio"
Omg like color and colour hahahahah I never thought about it but also Americans spell flavors
Fun Fact: The element gets it’s name from alum, a chemical compound the element was discovered in. It’s name was given to it by English chemist Humphry Davy, who initially called it “aluminum” in his 1812 book “Elements of Chemical Philosophy”. However, he was urged to change the name to “aluminium” by his peers in order to conform the element’s name with the vast majority of elements on the table at the time.    The IUPAC officially recognizes both spellings as correct, but the “aluminum” spelling is more common in North America due to the spelling being used by the American Chemical Society since 1925.
Funny fact: in my country Aliminium or Aluminum is written "Alumínio" somehow It is written with the "i" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Americans don't spell it strange we just have our own way... But just so you know anytime you come to America and we sound confused to what you're saying... Just say you're from a different country
WOW THIS TEACHER IS SOOO DUMB
Aight so the reason for this from what i can gather stems back from when telegraphs were a thing, they used to charge by the letter so some letters were left out to save a few cents, which is also why Americans drop the u in words like colour or armour
How now brown cow - say it!
Aluminum is the older spelling, they only changed it and added the I because it more closely resembles the other elements, such as helium, lithium, magnesium.   Which is dumb reasoning because you are forgetting there are elements called, molybdenum, and platinum.  I will continue to use the original word without the stupid I. Aluminum. And if you try to tell me otherwise, I will repeat everything I just said, but with sources. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Used both ways
Ha ha ha. Love this bro. Same exact problem I have in North America after studying all my life in British English.
Not just the US. It’s aluminum in Canada too.
🄸'🄼 🄰🄼🄴🅁🄸🄲🄰🄽 and I don't struggle aluminum
Alumnyum
Yo Chewkz do more videos about the roadman. That was cool.
Germany: thats right
I thought it was alumnium USA is stupid
Aluminium > aLuMinUm
Teacher: "You probably use this to wrap your sandwiches."  Me: "The answer is plastic!"
Just another way America wants to be different from the UK.
I grew up calling it aluminium, but everyone just started laughing at me😭😩✋
The reason that most American version of words lacked an extra character is because in the 1700s every character in a printing press cost money so they removed what they deemed unnecessary and it just stuck in the American dialect
Aluminium has an atomic number of 13 if thats wot u mean 13th element is a bit vague go back to gcse chemistry m8
Americans
It is aluminium
It was the lil look over and smirk after Ethan got it right 😂
Cling wrap
Actually it is Aluminium....because Lingua latinae. Latin is used as a universal language for chemical elements....and symbols are derived from Latin.
In germany its Aluminium.
Bro said wrap your sadwich and i said bread💀💀💀💀 i need that extra help bruh
In persian we say aluminium too
What the hell I am pronounce it wrong too
Can’t spell ether lol (me)
This has always pissed me off when I hear science channels say it wrong. This video is spot on.
Me from india ALUMINIUM
America strange.
"By 1812, when Davy published his book Chemical Philosophy he had changed the spelling to aluminum. As in the American version with one “i” and ending in “um,” aluminum. However, later that same year another anonymous scientist wrote an objection to Davy’s spelling aluminum in a British political-literacy journal, Quarterly Review. This other scientist decided that Davy’s spelling didn’t sound sufficiently Latin, and proposed the name aluminium, stating “for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.” Many people, this anonymous scientist included, thought that the “ium” ending was more consistent with other elements; much like the others named by Davy."  "The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially standardized on aluminium in 1990, though it hasn’t changed the way that Americans spell it for day to day purposes. Even though scientists generally use “ium” spelling, the IUPAC does recognize the “um” spelling as a variant. It seems a fair compromise."
🤣🤣🤣woooow🤣🤣🤣
It's pronounced alu mi nion if anyone says different you either can't read or you can't speak properly it's literally said how it's spelt.
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk CARA ELA TÁ TÃO NA SUA
This is wrong. You think you’d double check if you were gonna make a whole video about it. The original word, and current British spelling, does have the extra i. Think sodium or potassium.
Acting american cannot remove his accent
Everybody hates Chris: College days
Could say the same to you
Do ya'll really be sayin ALUM-IN-IUM FOIL?
USA people changed everything but still in south america we say "aluminio" so its basically their problem
Idk how to spell it but it says in the title that Americans say it weird but I say it how the second guy said it but spell it the other
But it is ‘aluminium’ 🤷🏼‍♂️
Aluminium = German
Well that is not fact, there are two spelling ways. Americans use the second one, however the rest of the world use the first one. Like Americans it is "color" however the correct one is Colour you twats.
Because all american are ****** 😉
I never knew Americans spell it like that!
In Malaysia everybody says Aluminium
Cmon America u can do better!
*The guy in red drinks a bo'o'oh'wo'a anxiously*
The British spell aluminum like the French?
Papers, I think, used to charge per letter so we dropped some letters to save money.
I don't know about other languages but even in Swedish it's spelled Aluminium
It's aluminium in India also
The fact that British Words Like Aluminium are just like the way Arabics Spell it.
Alumínio in Portuguese. Maybe they learnt to spell it like this from Spanish/Portuguese influence?
Man, you're the best 😂😂
Bro wtf really?? I didn't knew the "aluminum" thing 😂😂
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
So- people in Britain speak the ‘Queen’s’ English, which wasn’t actually a thing until the 1700’s. They basically created a new accent because they were petty and didn’t wanna be associated with America.  Meaning…  Americans are right.
The English is the right version Coz technically Americans speak ENGLISH in the word, aka ENGLAND so it was OUR language, and Americans use it so should use it properly and not change up the words, u can either speak the language or just make Americanish 😂
Portugal uses the European word aluminium, and not the western way of saying it
The “Everybody Hates Chris” song has be lmao! Great stuff <3
Well which one is it
I feel your pain
Aluminum is in Arabic
Im confused, which is used by the majority?? I say aluminium
Hmm okey
Haha! All Brits need extra help! Even Alec Steele, a blacksmith, was proven wrong (kinda haha) and had to admit it's aluminum based in the writings of the dude who named it ALUMINUM!
I went into an American school myself but we spell Aluminium AND Aluminum. Both answers are right if you use em in Science class or English Class.
Titanum???
The best part about this is that since the american language obviously evolved out of the British, there must have been some lazy people being like "naw fuck that let's skip the i in there" and now some decades later they complain about how dumb it sounds
U.S.A. USA USA USA
Who tf wraps up sandwich in that
Te f*uck wrong whit the amaricans
What he say??? "Alamania"?
U
The teacher needs some extra help understanding cultural differences! 😅 Awesome skit as usual ☺️
So true. I feel your pain
It’s Aluminium
Why do the English spell everything weird?
You mean, “why do Americans spell it correctly”
Another reason why British and Americans don't understand each other, even if they're speaking English 😂
Wait Americans say Aluminum?? Wtf man 😂
It happen as we Indians use mostly UK English sometimes US English with different spelling and pronunciation confuses us🤣🤣
Here we say alumínio 😎🤙
Well, the guy who discovered it called it aluminum, and the British changed it after the fact for "consistency", so I'ma go with us on this one
It is Aluminium.
I accidentally put potassium after sodium and thought the 13th element was magnesium. I got the groups and normal orders mixed.
The British way is better
What? Aluminium, aluminio what a mess
Тот, кто не хочет грузить люминий, идёт грузить чугуний (тм)
Lol for all those in the comments section fighting for the original spelling it was neither aluminium or aluminum it was alumium.
is it extra british to say alumininium?
I had the cheek to say "saran" 🙄
It is aluminium, it's just Americans have a habit of removing important letters from words
... yo then how can i say it correctly and spell it
The song choices always get me 😂
I speak British English, I didn't know until today that Americans spell the word with one 'i' 😐😐
🤣🤣
The red hoodie guy spelt it correctly. Only yanks cut out the second "i"
British people: Why do Americans spell words so strangely? Also British people: "diarrhOea"
There's this russian joke, I hope I can translate right. An officer in military forces yells: - Hey folks, get ready, you'll be unloading  Aluminium carload from a train - It's Aluminum, sir ! - Hey, those who so smart are gonna unload plumbinium
Everybody hates Chris song in the end LMFAOOOO
That one kid: TINFOIL
He said:why does american speaks this so weird  American:why does british speaks this so weird
Wait, they're the same thing...? I thought that aluminum and aluminium were different things-
fake topics hate these guy
0:30
america moment
u should've ask those foreign people in a foreign states befor u left there area
The British or correct on this you are literally speaking there language
The teacher doesn't know shit.. he should've known it's also called ALUMINIUM in almost every single fucking country!
Wait till they meet hliník
That's why there's US English and UK English
any who've descoverd it . his spell is the true .
Another example of Americans vs Rest of World
Omg I thought I was crazy, it's different now I see it
I knew how its pronounced  But did not know its SPELLED aluminum
Пол часа соображал, что дело не в ударении, а в том, что, какого-то хера там пропущена "i"👀
In french its aluminium 🤷🏾‍♂️
Extra class for accent correction maybe!!😅😆
IM from alumunium
Aluminum ❎ Aluminium ❎ Alumunium ❎  a Bo'ooh o Wo'ahh ✅
Meanwhile the rest of the world spells it aluminium.
This made me hate America
You use aluminium to wrap your sandwiches? I thought it was bread 😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mine is aluminium as well
😂
Same thing with sulphur and sulfur
Meh
Different language, different name
Why Americans say muzlim instead of muslim, it’s with an S not Z
guy in red burning with rage it start to materialize in black flames around him
"aluminium" lol
Bruh Britain changed it to be that way
I learnt It in british spelling In chemistry class . British english is far superior to American english. That's just my opinion.
We also say: aluminij. (As Americans do)
Tomorrow is my chemistry exam and I get to see this today
It's actually aru-mikan
He never fails to make us laugh 😄😄
Americans:ALU MI NIUM   BRITISHERS: ALU MI NUM  INDIANS: ALOO MIU NIAM
british people watching like yeah what the heck is wrong with those people
In Portuguese we say "Alumínio", should be the latin origin
Yooooooooo
Ah man the Americans either misunderstand or make fun of what our dude chewks say or pronounces any words.  We all know that the pronunciations between the British and American accent are very different, but come on guys!😂😂😂
There's nothing like American English.....there is only English and that is the Queen's English..... Americans just make everything complicated.....🤦🏻‍♂️😑
It's also Aluminium in German.
But actually it is Aluminium
Make more videos on this
TO quote Paul Bettany: "we say HHHH-ERB, because there's a fuckin' H at the beginning of the word!"
I'm from India. In India we learn British English. But I'm passionate about learning American English. So whenever I used to answer something like it student used to thaught what I'm saying.
Foil! 😄
lol both of you read "Na" as "Sodium"
As someone from Jamaica it took YEARS for me to figure out why there were two spellings... America is CRAZY!
Man the differences stun me and this is coming from an American guy lmao. Then again I’m painfully aware of the many stark differences in spelling to everything compared to the UK side

They're trying to foil the truth *Metal Joke*
😂😂😂
I am so confused now
No one:  Americans: äLüêMãHñùM
Hello from Brazil! You’re amazing
