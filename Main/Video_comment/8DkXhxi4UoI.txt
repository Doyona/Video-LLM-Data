Can you spot the Psychopath!? Watch here ➡ https://youtu.be/y2xcVBPLnk8
YuhHhHh!
This was pretty cool. He picked the right girl.
10:55 это было жестко. Тут уже поиздевались над ростом девушки
Dude just needs to be rich or famous and he can get all the tall girls he wants.
Despite all his confidence I don't think amy of them were interested in him
Why are you coming on a show where you know the guy is short if you don't date short dudes? 🍵
Now that’s a comic accrete short king!
Beans was a total dick for Xing the shortest girl because she was too short.
I fealt that 2 was in it for him but one was in it for her
Would be nice if you guys add a metic measures for the euroepean viewers. For example cm s
3:15 this one is perfect
having an upper limit is gay
HE was the tallest man in the room
That chick in the green 🙄
Cringe
shouldnt have let them compare heights until after the dates
10:53 uhhhh
so did they hang out after the show? I gotta know. She was cute and seemed really GF material.
shortest 5'3 i have ever seen
lmao no way he is 5'3, more like in the 4's lol
Ерунда. И кто делает полностью ярко белый фон должен гореть на солнце.
They should have had more girls that were in between 4’2” and 5’3” That was a big jump in height.. and personally I did think the girl who was 4’2” was attractive and had a nice figure In 5’0” myself due to childhood hypothyroidism that wasn’t treated 😵‍💫
He is under 4,11
If you are short, do no procreate
Yuhhhh
This goes to show that height does not matter that much but being taller does still help
I got next bro
Im 6’5 i want the last girl 🥰🥰🥰
Marty Mcfly anyone?
this guy is not 5'3
Very weird that they didn't have any girls in the 4'10-5'2" range, even though there's litterally over a billion women out there who are that height. You couldn't find any of them? I feel like a 4'11" a 5'0 and a 5'2" would''ve been reasonable, before you jump to women taller than him. Give Beans a chance to date someone shorter than himself for once.
Green shirt lady is so nasty in every way.
6:9 girl is wife material 😘😘😘😘😘....I'd marry her if she says yes ....me short Arab terrorist 5:10
The tallest girl was actually kind. If he had played it better. She was a single mom. Maybe if he had picked her up. It is not difficult.
Why would they even think about going out with the little booger?
he is definitely between 4'10 to 5. not more than 5
This video was also an experiment which shows us how pathetic people's rules are when it comes to mere height.  I'm 5' 10" but I could care less if my partner is taller, same height, shorter, or very short
Quite pathetic of any person, not to mention a short person, to reject someone else cause they dont fit your superficial height requirement. I'm 5' 10" and I could care less if my partner is taller, same height, shorter, or very short
Aubrey definitely has that LA cosmetic surgery look.
Lol i'm 5,11 and still rejected my girls 😂😂  Edit.i'm still a virgin
You can't be a "king" when you are that short. This isn't Munchkinland.
Endomorphisme d'espace euclidien
He said "roller coaster place" lmaoo bro you mean like a fair or amusement park 😂
I'm single 5'11"😢
He’d literally be a “step” dad for her.
Dude is a short chode
what a lovely girl!
The second one was great
Madi was the coolest
I think he is definitely not 5" 3,, im 5" 9 and my body alignment is enough good to tower him
Brown coat girl actually seemed interested, and mature. Girl he chose would get bored, shes too wild.
El chico mide 1.60
By the way the guy's height is 5'3"
Kayla @?
4'2? She has to be at least 3'7
I thought he might have some type of dwarfism because he looks super short to me and I just saw that’s he’s my height and now I think when people see me they think the same thing. To top it off my husband is exactly a foot taller than me so that probably just makes me look even shorter 🫤
short girls behaved well. tall girls not much
I am 5.2feet and 12 years
Stands on his wallet , goes up a foot - they're suddenly all interested
yup!!! ekaterina she once reply to me...😄
im 5 foot 3 without elephants duct taped to my feet.
3rd one was just DEI hire
Girl in green seemed either drunk or high
I need the follow up!
He is 5’0 max
Iam 5'6
Proud short king here.  Bean is awesome! He was polite and keeping it fun.    #8 was awkward af.  The intro to #9 had me rolling and lol!  Bean is great sport.  Go Short Kings!!
I'd go for the 6ft 9 in one.  It's like have 2 women in 1.
“He’s a good conservative boy” being conservative does not make you good. From a female perspective that’s a red flag.
15:15 2nd is more beautiful 😐
You are no king if you go to shows like this. You are a peasant.
Green shirt girl seems obnoxious, but I'm pretty sure they edited it to make her look even worse, the responses seem like they were cut out of order.
12:29 it runs in the gean
The 2nd girl was my type, I'd toss her around FO SHO
Damn americans with that height unit. WFT is 4"11?
Airrack
Why are you referring to them as "girls?" It makes you sound like a moron.
Poor guy it's rough being that height. He should have picked the first two girls
5'3 still NBA caliber!
laura and sam, in love, but not really, id watch that, she cute, hes cool would be a spin off
to anyone who happens to go out on a date with the girl in the green dress, she's there only for the food bro
Am 5"9 and any girl above me is straight up just tall idc 😂😂. Most woman are 5"4-5"6
Go for the tall one and see if you can climb to the top!
looks like a pooner
Brutal
You're lucky that the 6'9" girl was your friend, because getting hold of another one that tall is not going to be easy. I'm 6'7" and I've never met a female at my height or above.
I thought that guy was Seth Green😂😂😂
I’m 5’4” and it does feel tough in the dating scene. You gotta have confidence or else we ain’t getting laid dudes.
Wow the hosts are are annoying tbh
That's the problem that keeps happening for me too. I don't like the girls, that are appearantly in my league and the girls I like are appearantly out of my league. F-ck that.
On Addams Family, Gomez was Morticia's Short King.
The dwarven girl was kinda cute, idk why he rejected her. I don't think the taller girl was a vibe. I think he gave her a yes because they were only going to get taller from there.
I like him. I'm 5'1" but too old. 😊
Was that second chick a pr0n star? Because she seemed like one. Moved out to California for "work."
Hey did u notice background music
He should go for latinas or asians , most are an average of 5 feet .
Kayla is perfect
The tallest one is hot
SHe's pretty
Where have I seen the 2nd women in red before?
How do I know that guy?
Ekaterina ✅✅✅✅✅✅
most chic has a tattoo on outside of bodies... it turns me off
I like Anita.
If he and the tallest girl get together maybe they can have regular size kids. They can even out.
25 years with a short king & treated like the most glorious queen everyday ❤
Yeuuuuuu where's her pants?
If a 5'5" dude dumped someone as fine as Laura, you KNOW she's got to be annoying!
It's not easy being short.
I would have chosen Anita.  She's finer than baby powder.
Would love to climb that tall tree
They should use the metric system so these numbers actually mean something
Now imagine if boys are asked whether they would date fat girls and boys openly rejecting them. All the guys would be labeled as misogynist. We live in a world where fat shaming in detested but heightism is normalized.
eyeroll at 15:09
4'2 - 5'3 is quite a jump. You couldn't find anyone at the higher end of 4'? 5'3 isn't really that short. Actually, it's in my ideal range.
My guy had a chance to have.... Girl to the right would have taken him far to the right and the one to the left would take him far to the left ... But it was the one in the middle that would take him on the straight and narrow path of happiness
Short girls are super Sexy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Im 6f3inches, I would love to date the last girl.
The midget is a yes. Game over. I love midgets 🥰
wheat waffles
Notice how tall males look weird? Its short ones who look good. All women look good.
guy: don't care girl: what if i care.  classic.
*HOW IRONIC THAT YOU CUT GRACE "THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL" SHORT ON TIME!*
*I HAVE THE THIRST FOR GRACE! MY THIRST HAS NOT BEEN SATISFIED!*
8 out of 10 women stated not wanting a shorter guy, and one of the remaining 2 thought he'd break her heart... because of his height. I find this concerning.
Instant height rejection on the first girl was lameee
Man, the redhead!
I'm 6'4", wife is 4'11".  It is difficult finding cars we both fit in.
Hes not a king if he short
I am 5" 8" blue eyed male . So I thought I was short .
If every short king was as confident and smooth like beans, height wouldn’t be a problem.
What's an inche?
So great. Greetings from Poland.
This guy so cringe he discriminated against his own kind then said the 5’3 girl couldn’t wear heels but still chose to view the taller ones the vid is over for me
5’11 girl im 6’0 wanna take u out on a date
We like Sam and all his lady friends
None of these people will ever reproduce wtf? The most awkward collection of individuals I've seen
Those girls expect the 5'11 one all gave pretty vibes.
12:13 ngl i could get used to that
honestly as a 5'6 man taller women are really hot, not to take away from the rest of course
The first girl was the best one
6'9 Is the ideal girl
He's like Daniel Radcliffe crossed with Seth Green.
Loved short Kings attitude!
If I was him I would be all over that tall milf imagine how cool would to climb that mountain and stick my flag in. Love will be like a day of being in an amusement park all by myself
Ekatherina is soooooooooooooo.....soooooooooo beautiful . I can feel not just outside....she seems too be a great woman....I love her...
Are those red and green buttons for the girls  too or just for him?
Guy says his name is Sam and you say, didn't ask...yeah. Not watching the rest of the video. Too rude and disrespectful!
I'm 5'5" and taller women's height really don't bother me if I get to know that my future kids could potentially be taller than me.
13:45 now can you say moose and squirrel
2:56 beans you need to do some sandbag training  if these girls want to get tossed around
Maddie is a baddie
If any females are involved I'm automatically scared
The fact that women universally prefer tall men has absolutely NOTHING to do with the woman's own height.
The first one was beautiful!! I fell in love at first sight. Charming smile, gorgeous brilliant eyes!!
Me being 5'9 thinking I am ultra short at 16 and feeling depressed over it ❤😅
The hardest thing about being 5’3” is my Johnson dragging on the ground
The girl he chose is serious wife material. Hope he played his cards right because you don't stumble on a random tuesday.
I'm 6'0" - I think Maddie were hot 😌
5'8" chick is a smoke show
4:18 🤣
MAN, THAT ARE SHITTY EDIT! VERRY DISTURBING!
10:54 Whoever edited this video: STOP NOW. OMG 🤣🤣🤣💀
7:30 WAHAHA, I LOVE IT ! 🤣🤣🤣👏  8:21 YES ! 😂
I'm 5'7 and I thought I was short.
Him rejecting the first one due to her height is such BS!!!!
I’m 5’7 and I am struggling - You did well for 5’3
I think 5'5" girls make the best wife material out there, they have so powerful feminine energy with them  Anything above 5'9" gives a lesbian or a hooker vibe, literally feels like you are dating a transgender   5'11" girl and 6'2" girl felt like trans, no offense just a personal opinion, i am 6'2" and i feel its tall even for men in most countries, 6'4"  and above have a problem fitting in most places
So, is Maddie still single?
Now do tall woman blind dating 10 guys tallest to shortest
Number 1 is where it's at, lol.
Dude is a cool guy and good looking, don't think should have any problems getting a woman (even at his height, maybe I'm wrong though)
Do (heterosexual) guy/lady dating 10 people based on their biceps/calves
Would have been way more fun if he had to arm wrestle them and then button again
The first girl seemed nice really, i would date her and im 5'7
How are they heigth in terms of cm?
Shirt king... BUT MAN HE'S MORE HANDSOME THAN ME!!!
Is that Jim from The Office hosting this?  Also, the only short girl was the first one. 5' 3" is normal for a girl. 5' 8" is big. above 5' 8" is a pretty massive girl.
wow... Sam is a great date. He was always a good communicator with every type of woman.
Yep short men are doomed
Broke my heard girl is annoying as hell.
What a curse is to be short as a guy
Ngl I’m short like him but all those girls were attractive I would climb those trees, even the first girl was cute
2025 and YouTube just recommended this great video to me. What I've learned is that it's better to focus solely on women who show interest or send clear signals of interest toward you. Otherwise, if you pursue, there will always be some issue. If it's not height, it'll be money, or profession, car, clothing, hair, etc.
Daniel Radcliff searching for fun
As a 6’2” guy in America I can empathize for this guy.  You are short unless you are 6’3” or taller now, even for 4’11” high calorie women.
Whats the 5'3 girls @?
69 chick is for 58 me😅
Is no one gonna mention how the third girl resembles Olivia Rodrigo?
What's the outro song?
Isn't that Daniel Radcliffe?😅
Girl in green shirt only into black guys
I am called Sam
4:06 6:38 9:25 10:08 12:13
That red head in green shirt was high af 😂
The third woman is fine Anita
Dude looks like a  5 foot Justin timberlake
I'm 5'5"  175 lbs with very athletic build..I look like a smaller version of Franco Columbu..lol 😅..I've had no problem with women when it came to height. I actually feel attracted to taller girls..Just saying 😊
10:53 The edit lmao
It felt a bit like a racist thing from the hosts. The tall black lady was so gorgeous and nice
15:36 is that a hindi song from years ago?
contestant nr 10 is just an amazon queen!!! wow
My ole lady got a hemmheroid but that comes from too much anal so I'm wondering how Beans got his?
Did anybody else notice Jesse James West as the guy in white hat
Its crazy how fine women are with insulting shorter dudes
I have never understood the height thing. Physical attraction def matters, but, what can you not do from a dating stand point with someone who's shorter than you or taller than you within reason? It's really a weird culture thing.   Also, why show up for this video if you know ahead of time that it's absolutely a no? Maybe it's just me.  🤷
6’-9” and Bean turns his head on a hug. Bro you missed the motor boat.
I hope to find my tall queen soon
That is a bummer being short changed at birth with your d.n.a. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nah, I don't think Beans is 5.3. I know someone 5.2-3. That is not that short.
Yeuhhh
in the end. personality is what makes relationships work and most importantly last.
9:50 He can do her standing
Anita she is my taste 100% Does anyone know her social media?
green shirt girl was weird
Honestly, best way to deal with this is not to mention it.
What the f*ck is wrong with him, the 2nd one was HOT and FILTHY!!
As a 5’3 woman, I would totally go for a guy who is also 5’3.
Im 5"4' I could totally date shorter men and women but I dont think I could date a man taller than 5"11' , too much of a power imbalance
برنامج رخيص يقلل من قيمة نساء
wish heights were clarified more.
"awww, that's cute"  OOF. Bro got friendzoned in a second.
12:29 looks like Bilbo and Gandalf sitting at the table and Bilbo is about to pour the wizard some tea.
That dude is not 5'3... 5'1 at best.
Laura is hot
Height doesn't matter to me❤❤❤
Missed a whole plethora a girls 4'10"-5'2"
The one in green managed to put up 5 red flags in 4 answers.
Ya'll cutting in too much, im out.
lol. He’d feel tall around me, I’m only 5’0😂
5'11girl  is so beautiful 😍❤️
I'm 5'8
That little person is hot af
None of them get any credit?
"Would you date someone who is 5'3?" "No" "Even though I'm a millionaire?" "Height isn't important".
That girl in the green shirt was just nasty. Bullet dodged.
Im a 5'11 female. My partner is 5'6 He treats me so well and we get on so well
6’9” wearing heels and gorgeous
I am a 13 year old boy and am 5,8
the 2nd girl stole my heart.  WTF IS HER @ !?
As a 6 foot short king, i feel his pain.
Ekaterina is truly gorgeous!
Just trying to skim some off the propaganda aint ya. You dont care if you're giving little boys body dysmorphophobia in the process.
At the very end the girl in the middle is like “um ok, what a waste of time.”😂😂😂
Thats so me 4:48
The Office?
Height doesn't matter if a man got a 9 inches junk or bigger🤣🤣
It's funny how taller girls are cool
9:57 You're beautiful... true? I would hit the no buzzer instantly
Im 6'8 an single. I love short females
He has a resemblance to Martin Freeman and Daniel Radcliffe wtf 😮
did they realy talk after this ı wanna know ı wanna see if they match
11:59 that was very hilarious reminded me of lorax (movie reference)
I just wanted him to get the girl in the end...they looked like they had such good chemistry!
Okay but I have to know did beans and that girl actually date afterwards???
Kids compare height and make fun of short guys bro I'm 5'11 but i never make fun of short people
Honestly every height has its advantages, whether male or female.
Whos confidemce is boosted after watching this ?
How tall is the guy
Funny thing is…. Those super tall girls aren’t going to find anyone because they’re freakishly tall.🤷🏾‍♂️☹️
Holy crap, Lara looks like Shakira & I detect a Colombian accent!
The 3rd one looks like Olivia Rodrigo
The girls are just competing to get the green button hit, theyre not actually interested
Bruh... you could see the second girls nipples through her mesh shirt. I have seen stuff like that in public before and it certainly is interesting.
Egg😂
Oh wow. I guess it's the camera or something because he's my hight😅 (it could also just be how they presented it, but I thought he was much shorter)
they done got jim from the office hosting this channel
jim is doing his thing I see
That woman isn't 6'9". She's like 6'7" -- She wears heels.
Ha looks 160cm or less
15:36 she likes him
hahaha I loved it..... and he definitly picked the right chick
There is no way he is 5.3.i thinkHe is probably 4.10
My favorites are 3,4,7, and 10. Maybe partly cause I like curly hair
‘All you need is love. Love is all you need’ - The Beatles
I'm 5'7 and I think beans is cute. I would yes lol.
N o
so... are they dating or not??? did they at least smash off set???
Beans you need 7'11 girl !!   Coz ,yk dor future generations !!
Didn't ask💀💀 0:04
Why jump from 4ft 2 to 5ft 3?
He's got the handsome face of a 6' 3" (at least) guy! It's a strange world...😁😱😉
Why is Mara Topic there!!!?
they had to nerf bro
Only might girl f
Fun fact: im 6'5.. I prefer woman thats under 5'3.. Bet most tall men prefers that too.
What's the name of 6'9 girl
Need an update. So is beans and Kayla together still?
Im short but always wonder why did God creat taller girls than men  goels should be short always cause they don't do any work that matter
I mean yeah he’s nice but he’s on camera, on a show and he’s in nice-guy territory. He’s telling them he loves them minutes into meeting them too, tf
this was surprisingly informative and entertaining... but that redhead... damned
Short guys except Lil Wayne
10:53 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA The edits killed me lmfao
3 and 4 were fire.
Why do people insist on hugging people they don't even know? Don't be peer pressured into it! A handshake is just fine.
This made me depressed. Im not short but seeing how funny and chill someone is at a shorter level. Still wouldn’t make you good enough
The woman in red is just looking for screen time
Wow Beans is the height of a comic book accurate Wolverine.
Girls having curly hair is hot af.
Daniel lil cliffe
I know this was a yr ago but did they actually start dating?
1:02 doesn't even help her up lol
Why would he not choose the dwarf?!  She was the perfect height for him!!
Whats Kayla's @ ?
6.9ft ekaterina is the best for me👍
From 4'2, they should have gotten ladies from 4'5, 4'8 then 4'11 just to see a gradual increase in height. Sam met only one girl shorter than him.
I am 6 3  She is 69 😮 Final boss
He is 5'2ft  not 5'5
the way this dumbass was fumbling the coffee girl was crazy fr
You know what's not hard? Using SHOPIFY!!!!
9:48 9:55  9:58 How many times she gonna say Yuh?
any girl that says YUH, is a ghetto woke girl. REJECT
Short kings dominate https://youtube.com/shorts/iz7VBfvBXII?si=ECBfKDOy7_gx6Xmw
Tall guys don’t really want a tall woman . Tall guys like short woman mostly . Tall woman don’t realize this .
Is beans good at basketball
Why would a tall girl wear heels to a dating show
YUUUHHH
holy crap some where unnececarily rude.
No @'s for the females ?
He's like a half pint Ned Flanders. I love it 😂
He made a mistake on girl #2
Im ngl that short guy rizzed me up too
Hes so handsome and charismatic, he can date me LMFAO 😍
like tom cruise🤣😂 trying to find a date
he made the right choice
- i have hope - why? 😭😭💀💀💀
I just started watching this and got a feeling Ekaterina Lisina will be the last one.
Maricella....wow
I feel like the first gal would be hard for many guys to say yes to.  Most of the others wouldn't have really interested me anyways. 4 was pretty cool...  I personally wouldn't be afraid to date the shortest or the tallest. Honestly the first one and the last one seemed like the two nicest ones.  *EDIT* Btw, at the end when he made his choice, she made a little comment "That's cute."  That was a red flag for me.  He should've picked the first girl.
i mean my dad is 5.7 mom is 5.5 and they together because they actually cared bout their personalities, not heigth
“Yk what else is hard” 💀
Girl @9:54 was high af 🤣🤣🤣
Short dude will need a top hat soon to contain that tall hair. Get the extra inches however you can I guess 🤔
Ekaterina she is so tall and so beautiful ❤️😍
Yeah Bean is pretty cool, shout out to all the short people out there like me
The  8th girl seems like a major, self-absorbed POS
Whats Diana’s @ ?
damn hes teller than me. he looks short on camera lol
damn this was a waste of my life
Nahh I’m 11 and I’m 5 foot 1 inch
Thor and his wife is an example of a very height difference
6'3 and cant get a date with 1
Green shirt girl mase me want to throw up
He is very attractive
This video made me feel tall (I'm 5'2) 🥺👉👈
Gosh that tallest gal is a sweetheart. Very charismatic. (and pretty)
The 5’11 and 6’2 girls were just straight up bitches
Why does 5’11 girl care about what other people would think if she was dating a guy shorter than her like that’s already a red flag right there
Why is the 5’9 girl even on here? Clearly she’s not over her ex
Super smart men!!! The smart women who will chose him will win...
Sam's energy is the greatest.
i watched 5 minutes of this, until the hemoroids... that's the most POS video i have ever seen.
Bro it’s like an Opossum dating a Giraffe!!  It’s not going to work.
12:22 im 13 and 5,11
10:53 this had me rollin, lmfao
"beans" as a nickname is really funny
The first one is kinda cute :P
I think he’s really attractive! I’d date him, but hopefully he found his match! I viewed on Snapchat
THAT 5'10 GIRL and 5'11 girl are HOT as a 6'4 man I'll hit them up if I get the chance
who go their OFs and IGs?
Do you want to be your children short?
He picked the best one. She's gorgeous and seems like a fun woman. I love her eyebrows too.
What’s the second girls @
Who scouted these women, wouldn't they get women even of taller heights to come in that are interested in shorter guys? Just seems so wasteful to bring women on who were not interested unless he was taller than them in the first place LOL
Beans!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡🫘
Lol so if she wears heels a dude cant toss her? She ain't that heavy.  And the other girl won't give another short guy a chance because one broke her heart? Thayd crazy. She gonna do that with average and tall height guys, too?
Why didn't you find him 10 hot babes just a little bit taller or a little bit shorter than him and maybe would one of them would have a good personality also!
whats the end song called 15:40
I'm 5ft so I'm shorter than him and he looked really short so it  sometimes puts perspective on how short I really am. I have a taller king as I prefer to be the short queen.
Nice❤
4:40 worst commercial transition i think humanly possible... Wtf
The first one is a good match for him..I'm not short or tall(6'0) but they all look good to me. Can't do the 6'9.
__==
Wolverine?
What is bean name?
"You guys". Now that's toxic, she will reject short guys, because ONE broke her heart. That says a lot about her ego..
He's the perfect height for motorboating the last girl lol
Is that airrack
mf named beans
The girl he chose would dump try hard shorty in a second for the tall doesn't care sweats wearing bum look guy in the end.
Bro fumble the bag with the red dress
5'3 is cap, hes more like 5 foot or 5'1
I’m 5’6, and I’m hoping to find my tall queen!
Tattoos are nasty.
How to contact to Anita!!??
Bruh. The fact the short “king” has a hight standard is crazy. 😂
Doesn’t matter if your flesh and bones are small. It matters if you have perfect loyalty and perfect love for your partner. If your soul is big that’s all you need. Having a soulmate in heaven and earth is very important. Let the good lord guide you.
I kinda liked the two shortest girls.
Oh god, the hyper specifics of height, the hemroid, the hair length, the hair color, the hair dandruff I’m getting flash backs
Bro got WASTED
what glasses are those
We need to do a tall guy next
As soon as someone tells me they filter out a certain height I’m out.
Yahhhhhh
Beans is adorable.  ...I laughed the whole time, and THAT is priceless.
W short  King
Beans is 100% a 10/10! He is a catch and an inspiration to be enjoyable gentlemen.
181cm = ???
after watching beans,i think that,we must agree he is gentleman.
the 5,11 girl has a brain of an ant. Christ almighty. She might be tall but her brains small.
As soon i see tattoos, se's gone.
I'm 6'7" and would love to find a girl over 6'2"!!!
You know I think the biggest factor is... do the genitals match? As inappropriate as it is to say, if he's packing a python then... 🤷
I'll take any of those girls but that black girls looking fine!
I am 6'0, basically the 6'2 lady is like a hand taller than me, so my forehead is basically on her nose. The last one girl which is 6'9, the gap is a little bit higher, because I have a Mate which is 6'7 and I am basically on his jaw, so probably I'd fit on that girls Neck, I consider myself average but I'd like to be like 2 inches taller.
Pretty sure the last woman is actually only 6’7…
I really thought he was tall😮😅
Producers of the show dressed like bums. Not good when contestants on the show are dressed far and above better than the show producers.
Rename this show “it can only go up from here”
Second one is super intense and seems not classy at all in her approach.
Did they date after the show?!?
That first chick was stacked bro lol
To*
"I got a lot of torque" 🤣
Why are some women so mean?
Pick the shortest and tallest. You can pick one up, and you can be picked up by the other.
7 foot yes pls... she's the only hot woman there... I definitely would
I would date that 5'5" girl she is damn cute sensible and sounds sincere
aint no way its airrack
Hes short but he has a great personality. He will be fine.
The ending background music.. it sounds so similar.... Did anyone notice it sounded like Jhanvi Kapoor's item song
I hope they get married and have lots of babies.
That contrast between the hobbit and the tallest girl blows my mind
I’m 13 and 5,1
Next time please consider including a meter system as a quality of life for a non-american viewer. Thank you!
i’m 5’10 being short is so crap i will get height lengthening surgery one day hopefully then u can be 6’1 average
I’m 5,9 and would love to date a midget or dwarf woman. It’s funny that shorter men love tall women.
This video represents the 10 percent short guys have to go through in the society.
For reference Mikhail Kalashnikov was 5.3. Thank you!
That 6'9 lady is smoking hot
I can't stand these giant women who want a guy thats taller then them, like dude your taller then the average man your not going to find a guy taller then. Men taller then 6"2 are like less then 5 percent of the population now
HEEEEY lemme do one of these I'll have a chat with the last one, 6'9???? tall queen PLUS funny number? 10/10
Daniel Radcliff?
Love Airrack
I know I'm gonna be tall cause I'm 6, 1 and 15 years old
First girl would have got a pass for me, her body is banging.
I'm 6'1" and my girl I've been with 13 years now, is 5'2".  She's always said she wouldn't date shorter men. Her preference is at least 5'10".  Lol, she elaborated further in her belief that taller men are more well endowed... Which was one of her goals in a mate.❤
I am 6’3 and wife is 4’11. I tower over her. I can imagine a woman my height towering over a short dude 😂.
Oh dear
Wiat no way Beans is THAT small :O
Why harry poter is comunicating from tv
7:46 tall men don't cheat?
5'11 girl -  ☘🐸✅💚Yuuuuuuuh✅💚☘🐸
4ft 3in❤
Girl bye😂 2:44
This channel was alive for only 1 year
As a adult i cam confirm being short has now became a curse for today society
Bro he is not even that short🥲
Nah that guys definitely 4'10 -4'11
The two he didn't pick neither of them smiled one time. They were robots.
Fun fact: Wolverine in the comics is 5"3.
Oh, can I have a number of Mari Cella and Diane?  *I'm 6'4
More than 50% of women are shallow assholes is what I got from this
I'm a 6'8 guy and my wife is 5'7, and I don't personally see her as short rather I see myself as too tall, our daughter is 6'1 at 18 and son is 5'8 at 13.
I hope it worked out and she wasn’t just a clout chaser
Beans is sweet and funny.  Unless he's different behind closed doors,  any woman would be lucky to be with him.
some of them were... well exactly what how i expected women to behave
They went from 4'2" to 5"3. Bummer
10:54 thr edit goes crazy 💀 whos the editor?
Hm
The girl that was 4'2 was the best choice for him,
LAURA was my favourite, she is so preety
My name's Sam
First time watching your channel, loved the show.
the really be letting that girl hang her nipples out thats insane
Dang, this guy is very charming. I (male) would be happy to be his friend.
I count 7
How tall is he?
Gosh, only the final girl is taller than I am..  - Not anything I would care about if the brain is added to it !
The way the host acted when the black girl was talking was micro-aggressive. She sas gorgeous and the short guy clearly liked her
this height distribution of this group of women is like 1 in 100,000
Jesus what an idiot. That firt one was fine. He had no chance with others 😂
Let him date 10 short people bruh
He is a handsome guy i have to say. no h0m0.
I'm 6'5 😂😂😂. I gets all the bishes!!
5"11 is why i dont date my age 😂 dumb as rocks
Mans didn’t hug no black women lol 😅
The last women hugged him twice lol
Damn he is the smallest man I have ever seen which isn’t a dwarf! And he ain’t 5.3. no way!!!
We do need that Tv show from those tho becuz ummm- they both hella funny
I'm 4.6 female I also don't care about height because I care about the inside ❤❤❤
Bruh 5'3 is like 160cm right? I'm 171cm/5'7 and always feel short how about him🫂
Brothers, I'm 5 feet 5 inch 😢. I love a girl like Diana 5.10 so  I need to pass this hole entire life alone because this type of tall girl reject me forever
Yuhhhhhhh😂😂😂❤❤❤
10:54 DAWG NAAAAAAH You did not just do my man dirty like that 😂
AroAhhhheee wh🐋 🐳 le
Bro the 5’9 girl was kinda whack she literally shouldn’t have come on the show if she didn’t want to date another short guy💀💀
the one with the biggest cake is mine
ok honestly... he is taller than my gf-
i seriously dont understand the hight thing... like it doesent matter- ok maybe it does but when your average hight it doesent make sense that someone would reject you-
The 2nd girl was perfect for him she is pretty and the same height as him
he 100% picked the best girl of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would have carried the 1st girl under my arm and left.
Some of these women were so arrogant.
IS NO ONE GONNA MENTION HOW THICC THAT FIRST CHICK WAS?!?!
When you say you’re 5’11 this is how girls picture you.
10:15 they go and embarrass the girl for not wanting to date someone short but he rejected the first little woman fast because she was short but doesn’t want to be judged for being short???
5'11" girl was cringe
surprising that only one woman isnt proportioned. That 6'9 woman is so well proportioned.
Am i the onley one who was thinking of lucifer then i saw the tittle?
Beans laugh is incredible😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
if he was gay i would love to take him on a date hes so cute haha
Dibs on the first one
HE GOT W RIZZ BY A GIRL..
People are nasty to short men, shameful
Being a tall beautiful woman, strangely I’ve never dated a guy my height. Tall guys want small girls. Tall girls need to feel feminine too
Second girl and the girl in the green shirt 🤢
the first girl is seriously gorgeous
5'5" is the prettiest of them all.
HI
Ummm he will get a gf
Yuh yuhhh true yuh yuh yuhhhh
I am 1,82
He absolutely picked the best woman
Woman with tatoos red flag.
He isnt 5'3
Hello the 10th women is so beautiful
juuuh girl is annoying as fuck
Brother, can you find me a girlfriend because I am alone? 😢
Girls will say don't judge height the first girl as said but girls compare men height
What's that last song name  15:40
guys, how tall is he?
Lmao confidence restored
I'm 5' 2" and Beans is a legend in my eyes.  One thing that hits home here is that it's always important to check what height difference she's okay with. The same way i wouldn't want to date above a certain height, she's allowed to not date below a certain level
Okay I always knew that I was short, but I never knew people sawsaw me that short 😭😭 (btw I’m 4,3)
Beans is delusional...
9:38
7:58
7:05
9:12
9:31
What’s the name of the ending song?
I really hope Bud Bundy found love.
If u see the world history, u will found in most cases 5.3-5.9 feet men ruled the world!!
Who is the girl that’s 4”2
Short, balding, or small tree will get you almost an instant no!😅😅😅😂
Nah the green shirt girl was insufferable
This was a masterclass in how to talk to women, he took the punches in his stride and did not miss an opportunity to charm. Surprised he’s single.
Beans: Hey 5’11 girl: YyyyUuuuHHhHhh
5'3" guy rejecting somebody for being too short is craaaaazzy
13:22 he looks like a hobbit 😂
Using his two likes so early was the smart move, he knows it will be much harder later on.
When he said you know what’s not hard I thought he was ganna say me…
I thought it was Daniel Radcliff
Hilarious and enjoyable ❤
Yuuuuh
This guy is so cute omigoodness. And great charisma and confidence
his kid:🧙🏻‍♂
I'm 6'4 so I have never had this issue with women but I sure am glad I'm not short after seeing this video. These girls are ruthless. I have always said, it's the girls who have the most baggage and the least to offer who are by far the most demanding. It's no wonder why many of them are single. I do get where Anita was going with the rollar coaster ride... I think what she was saying is that if she really wanted to go on the coaster and that happened, then he should say go ahead and wait and compromise. I don't think she had selfish intentions there.
He needs to wear heels to increase his height.
No way that’s 5’3
It's confident test
6 8 ( 6 9
The short guy has very cool attitude!
Love tall women.
5'10" woman, dam
Beans if you're reading this right now, i looked all over for your social media or youtube channel and couldnt find anything but a facebook clip of you dancing.. you need to make content bro
I’m 13 years old and I’m 5’8 and 1/2
The middle one is really cute
He is reaching higher grounds by the minute
15:28 The middle girl is amazing, seems very traditional and humble
Im almost 5’8 and i would be even sadder if i was shorter. can i at least be 5’10 i could get more women. they actually love tall kings. even the 4’11 ones.
I’m 6’8 and everyone is pretty much the same height; shorter than me and for me that’s just kinda normal so the only one who would be interesting would be the girl who’d be an inch taller. But I’m married so I digress, just watching this for the entertainment.
I want #2 😮 damn
Why did they bring all these tall women in if they weren't interested in dating a short guy it doesnt make sense they didn't think this through
Is it just me or do the 5'5 and 5'8 women look the same height?
My boi beans is locked in
He is handsome
The cohost with the white shirt is so childish and weird. Instant ick.
The 5'11 girl was chill , whatever you say she says yuuh😅
No one is saying this but that guy looks like Harry Potter
2:22 if this girl is 5'3 and looking short and I'm 5'1 watching this video make me feel like a dwarf 😢
I'm pissed that he rejected the first girl. She was adorable
I’m six foot one but I’ve got my own problems. It’s nice to be taller than most people though.
I think second girl was most beautiful
I am short and personally i am on the extremes. I love climbing mt everest and i love extremely short girl with dwarfism. It all started in middle school wnd high school. I would get hit on by really tall girls and extremely short girls. At the end i ended up prefering tall girls. When you can conquer a woman twice your height you get a high that is indescribable.
I've been married for 27 years, my wife is 5'10 and I'm 5'6
The 5’11 girl thought she was 2 Chainz
Women say men are shallow & they reject the guy just because he’s short !!!
Yikes lots of inflated lips here the 2nd was the worst and too much tattoos. I would rather see ZERO tattoos. I'd probably accept some but NO tattoo sleeves, ladies you are permanently staining your skin too much. Inflated duck lips are a NO it is a complete turnoff so gross I would rather have natural thin. Out of these ladies I'd pick the 6'9"... if she had lip filler it's not a lot just do not get addicted to it because you will ruin your looks.
The small girl has the cake
Bro is 1,60 cm ? And he REJECTED THE 2nd girl? SERIOUSLY DUDE?
I'd have thought the tallest women would be more up for it. I was wrong.
This is arguably the most attractive man you can find at 1.60m, both in terms of looks and demeanor
Yuhhh
'I learned so much about myself'  Girl wheezes  True love right there
Gorgeous
"I want to be thrown around." That has nothing to do with height, Beans, you should have rolled with it. I'm about Beans height and I know I could pick that woman up.
Maddie the baddie
10:45 kera prasica kuzrčeva
I liked this dude. Very smart and his choices and confident. I liked his playufulness while owning his height. He really deserves a nice gf
I don"t understand why these girls come to this show if they are not into short dudes ?
Iam 5”6 male  … stay away from dating app club or bars any place where physical appearance matters let them come to you ..yea short men we get laid but women don’t wanna get married or have children that are short
12:13 I wish I was that guy rn
So lovely ladies ❤
He made the wrong choise, the girl in middle was more beautiful and more nice
I once rejected a woman because she was too tall (5'10"), and man did she get angry.  I am sure she had not one ounce of guilt rejecting guys who were at least 6'1"
It does not mater the hright but the heart.
(7:48) mm..uh huh..mm... 😑...🥱...😴
Im 13 and 5'3"
How tall is he?
He is good
Last one was like seeing Harry Potter trying to date Madam Maxime.
Madi seemed pretty cool! Beans was chill!!!! Short kings unite!!!
*This guy is insanely reasonable and very spontaneous none the least.* He knows his principles and reads the signs: - he checks if height matter, ergo seeks if there are high standards or not.  - he let the 6th girl decide which is already smart especially when it's hard to choose or when you pick up the sign she might not be interested  He probably got a bit stressed out after the 3 tallest, I think 10 would be a great option. Still Sam and Laura (6th) could actually be great friends, their chemistry could actually be very stable. Chemistry between Anita (3rd) is great, he was actually really in love at the end, so cute. Funny how the right voice-over guy picked Caleb (4th) specifically, that's amazingly predicted. Sam and Caleb's chemistry is actually top-tier. Sam really knows what to ask (always love to see a good learner) and surprisingly Caleb pushed a green button even *back.* wow  Really needed this one! We will never know how long they'd last, but it's their right. Sometimes this format and content just brings the best in people, I'd love to be on there but I'd rather stay in my country for love 😆
I’m 11 years old and I’m lit 5*4😂
You guys did good.  Very interesting.
Bro fumbled so hard not picking that first girl
I’m 5’4 but I’m 14 I think I am gonna be 5’8-5’10 when I grow up btw but the point is that many people think I am 12 just because of my height and it annoys me how most of my school friend that are 14 are like 5’8 but if they don’t care about my height I’m fine btw my height type as a 5’4 14 year old is a 5’2-5’4 girl
my aunt is 5'2 and mu uncle is 5'3 but they look taller
Cute
Bro, he said he’s been working with Shopify before YouTube but his oldest video is eight years ago lol
6'9 is awesome
the second girl was quite the tiger!
How can he cope?
I am 6,5 male and i really care about my height bcz %60 girls are like tall guys
I’m 5’11” and I don’t think I would like to be with a girl who’s taller than me in heels
Meanwhile, Asian women are snatching up the Western guys.
Man that first girl was perfect height
Fellow short guy here, just saying it’s a vibe when you’re on the town and you got a lady by your side whose 6’4” and fine as a dime 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
i'm a 5'2 ft tall Vietnamese girl and this is a popular height in Vietnam.Thanks to this vid, I knew I'm so short:)
Yuhhh girl was making me laugh bruh instead of responding she’d be like “yuhh” 💀
My man beans got torque
I guarantee that if Beans was 6’2 all of those ladies would’ve fell in love with him. That’s just unfair
I was expecting one woman to have a kink for feeling like an Amazon.
Yuh
2:25
whats up aubrey
2:37 Aw 😢 that's so cute 🥰 . Someone once told me, do not wear heels or anything that made me taller because I made them feel short and that I was already taller than the average girl. So now I don't wear high heels anymore
1:26 She right 👍
The host comes of as a douche huh. A 6 dollar personality for sure
My son is about to turn 10 and he is already taller than beans
Its like watching a hobbit dating show
Anita is from a tomorrows teachings video im pretty shure
Where's the rest of ya?
I am 5 ' 4" and the last year who ask Bean if he could carry her, i would have said yes and i would have provide it .
Kayla look good
The tallest girl also has just gorgeous feet!
kaksi it’s jus hills
I adore the last girl, she is So beautiful! The body proportions are amazing 😻 Long neck, slim arms, beautiful breasts, waist, hips, long legs... She is so beautiful for me. The winner is also beautiful.
Weird to watch, I'm 6ft 9 and my wife is 5ft3, my mum used to take the piss out of me all the time saying she looks like my daughter. I kinda get it watching this.
I am 5,6 find girl for me
#Hourseparty   woman who ask 6ft is a requirement  she needs to get on a scale ..... woman will have a double standard on things men can't change
9:03the right answer would be “don’t worry girl, you won’t have to bob back and forth a long distance”
nobody would ever force this on me wtf and im 5'10
This guy had a masterclass on how to handle rejection
The first girl seemed really wholesome, I don't think he should have rejected her tbh.
First time watching these types of fucking videos 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and last
6:46 Björk
It’s funny I’m 6;3 21 and have never dated
How tall is the boy?
6'2 for a women is like 6'7 for a man. Mad tall.
What happens next?
The reasoning behind women wanting taller men has nothing to do with biology. Instead,  it has everything to do with constant social standards we place on ourselves. Furthermore, 98 percent of relationships in all forms of  media show the same common trope of the man always being the taller one. And little girls see that, thus when they're ready to date,  that is the one attribute they look for.  So, in a nutshell, women are brainwashed into wanting taller men.
average feminist : 6 foot is invincible to bullets , iron man and can take on god   😂😂😂😂
The one he chose is stunning
I’m 6’6” and this just pissed me off so much that I’m fuming beyond words. I’ve not really been putting enough effort throughout my life academically, and the only way I went full send for is athletics, because that’s what I was good at. I don’t have the brains for maths and physics, but apparently my height (which is something I literally didn’t do anything to support/sabotage) gets me thru my 20 years of living in this world. Yes, I never really had any problems getting into relationships with the best girls in school and in my college campus, but after you fulfill your desires, you feel like an absolute pos simply because you never really put effort into anything
I have a suggestion for that 6'9" lady she can marry Mr. Oliver Richter ( world's tallest bodybuilder) if Mr Richter is willing to . If they have a male  offspring together then that boy would maybe touch the pinnacle of Human height ( obtained without any disorder). I know it's highly unlikely to happen But I just wrote it because I was thinking of her while the launch time and it came to my mind suddenly .
You better be funny and confident if short
Straight up you missed out on the first two bro
I like the midget girl best.
Hi
This is so wrong, why you pick girls that dont even want to date short people, is just wrong. It easy reject for him, when they say they dont like shorter. I like those 2 shorter one in the finale, they would fit you perfect and they are beautiful as well.
12:05 I recognize her from the Oliver Tree music video 😄
im from philippines 4'10"  male here 😂😂😂
the funny thing is that the 5'11 girl is the height of my 13 year old son
Yuuh.. true.. yuuh... lol  The two shortest of the last 3 deserved a "trophy", not just one :)
well the one in the red is a keeper😅
Ha that's funny, the only Marizela i ever knew was tall with curly hair too
Beans needs new friends
5'3 Girl was The Cutest ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So how tall is HE? They don't even say.
so now what's 5'9" gonna do if someone TALLER then her breaks her heart?~
Bro called me single in 10 ways😢
"You guys???" lmfao.....he felt she was insinuating that he was part of a race of Oompa Loompas or something 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He dumped the first girl for being short? She is a solid 10
Wow, the 4'2" lady is phenomenal!
The short girl was legit cute. I'd date her!
I don’t like short girls🫵😂🫵🤜😂🤛
They got every girl taller than him and only 1 girl shorter than him as a joke. Honestly this video could've gone better if they took it as seriously and sincerely as Sam did, he seems like a great guy.
I've heard so many women say they don't date short guys cuz guys are insecure and won't let you wear heels. But i think from this video it's safe to say it's the women who are insecure about being larger than a guy.
The last one is delighful
Back in the day starting from the 20's, tall women only dated and married short kings. Im 6'2" and i don't date men over 5'9".
the girl that didn't get picked at the end was looking bummed :(  also, lady in red is not intimidating. She just likes to be thrown around. Done that, she loved it.
the girl in the middle at the end looked like olivia rodrigo 💀
airreck what your hieght 6.2 or 5.9
Tatooed woman = red flag 😮  He is such a nice Hobbit 😊
My boyfriend stands on his tippy toes when he wants to kiss me. It’s the cutest ❤.
Dude am 6 1 and  i feel short😂
I’m shorter then the second girl who came out oof
Man I like him😂😂❤❤
He is so handsome
The first girl Ngl has a gyaat
Whada lil tuRd got me dien😂
Im a 6'5 guy and would love to date a taller woman than i but those are so goddamn rare
7:10 he might have been 5’5 but he was a foot long where it counted. Hence the heartbreak.
i honestly don't understand why he would reject a girl for being too short.. too tall i can understand, i'm a woman and 6ft and i habe dated shorter guys but it was ALWAYS an issue in one way or another so i understand the confidence issue (for both!!) but wouldn't a very short girl be cool for him so he can feel tall for once?
I just wanted to say "they should have found women that actually would want to date someone of his size in the first place."... but then I remembered, I am about his size and there simply ARE NOT any women like that.
He's 5'3? My brain tells me he has dwarf proportions so he must be shorter than that. Like look at the size of his head and hands at 0:19 relative to his body
I love tall women
bro is about to go gay after this video
I am 5'4 so I would look as short as him? omg OMGGG
How is he rejecting someone for their short height
Not everyone is a king.  Why is he a king.
i wouldve enjoyed this more if they didnt cut to the 2 annoying unfunny dudes after every sentence
yuh-girl was tripping on ketamine, like hard
Yuuhhhhhhhh
I like the 1st one 🍑
The woman that's 5 foot 5, at 3:25, said she wanted a man 5 foot 10 to 6 feet 2, so that's 5 to 9 inches taller than her. Average woman is 5 inches shorter than a man, she would be 5 feet 10 as a man, and that's the shortest she would go, she wants to go up to 4 inches taller than what she would be if she was a man. If women want tall men, you cannot afford to make babies with short women, a 6 foot man, and that's the minimum they often want, that's 5 feet 7 if it was a woman. So we as men cannot risk having babies with women shorter than that, we need women to be 5 feet 7 and up, so we don't risk having short sons who will no get a partner!
Wait... why wouldn't he date someone much shorter than him?
You are not "shorter" darling, you are a dwarf.  Third girl is gorgeous and feminine.
7:49 that girl is a certified yapper😂
I kind of wanted to watch this for the entertainment value, but the editing is so all over the place. Are you trying to disorient your viewers?
Laura is tweaking, people like her are annoying
How tall is he?
Yaaaa
that 5'9 girl was so annoying  What was she even doing there
Hey Airrack! Can u ask beans if "Mini Golf" It's just "Regular Golf" to him? Thanks
Beans makes me think of Seth Green for some reason
Yeah those 2 that he picked are Ws
STOP WITH THE ZOOM CUTS!!!    It’s giving motion sickness!
is this smrda?
Wait... he rejected someone for being too short? What a jerk...
Second finalist in the sport coat was beautifully stunning
I knew it was my beautiful beans!!!
He is not 5'3😂
Bruh why does the 5'11 chick looks so tall tho, im 6'5 and i was thinking she looked taller
I was waiting for the great Khali 😔
Sounds like larry june or premo rice would spit on this.. NUMBERS!
All the girls look great 👍
I am surprised he wont date below 4'11
He definitely chose the best girl there 👏
YUH
Kayla seems like a cool chick
He looks like harry Potter
His laugh 😂❤
She was 6'8" until she said she had a kid. Then she became 4'3".
He definitely picked the best one of the bunch by far
It has to be more popular and make short guy popularty as high as possible.  Don't ask me why I said that lol :d
stupidity of this is insane
Ngl he's handsome
To be fair the girl who matched with him was the most beautiful out of the 10!! wow!
The 6 foot 2 black girl was just a gross person
Did Beans find love?
Last chick was really nice
Bro why did you make him wear glasses he already had a massive handicap with the height thing and you also made him a 4 eyes smh u gave him no chance lol
What do they tell women to come ? I mean are they desperate for meeting someone or something?
Yeaaaa
LAURA BE A SAVAGE!!! 💀💀💀
💗Jesus loves you so much!💗🎉
so where is his kingdom?
I’m also called a short king at school
I men how many people can say they have dated a beautiful 4foot 3 inch tall girl
I would have picked the shortest girl she was and atill is thenmost attractive.
I'm 6'3. If I'm dating someone shorter or taller, it doesn't matter to me.
So what’s the update did they go on a date….?!?!?
I love how men who are borderline midget height are reffered to as *short king*😂
When a girl says that BS about “oh no I can’t, my soul mate is tall, rich and handsome”  Girl your soul mate might be 3,8, poor and overweight.   Girls are so immature about this subject.
Lmao I thought he was like a dwarf or something ain’t no way dude 5’3 😂😂😂
6:37 literally the best looking one there
She is the most attractive but when it comes to dating i would go for the next girl , the girl wearing a jacket. She seems a little upset.
Come on you couldn't find a girl 4' 11  to 5 . It would be ideal. I'm 4' 11'' by the way
Whose the girl from 0:54  Maddie I tried finding her @ to follow her on instragram couldn’t find out what her name was she was the most attractive in my opinion. I don’t judge based upon height and she seemed very authentic and sweet
Bruh, I'm a 5'2 and 23 year old female and ive stayed the same height throughout highschool 😂 most women make a whole deal about height. Short kings are adorable and so are below average males, so gentlemen don't change for these buttheads out here
I liked Kayla, too.
im 6'5'', have dated  from 4'5 to 6'2'', and everything in between.  i prefer the shorties mostly.  ever hear of any amazon woman refereed to as cute?
Wait I didn’t know he was that short
5’10 is stoned
I didn’t like the girl who kept on going yuhh
5 foot 3 is the tallest i would go. i am 6 foot 3 but we all know 5 foot tall petite girls are the best. the 5 foot 3 girl had to many tattoos and not tiny enough. 5 foot tall 100 pounds. that is what i prefer.
isnt this the exact same as the mtv dating show where they give advice tot he date person from inside a trailer???
it was pretty obvious that anyone who is 5'9" and above will not pick him waste of time just to have a funny video
Ben. S.
13:20 Ur eye levels are like at my .... got me dying😂😂😂
😂Hunter
Just a note: If you grab her by the hair on the back of her head, you can toss her wherever you want.
step on me  9:12
Not for nothing, but so many women today aspire to having Gandalf eyebrows, waxy, paralyzed faces with bloated-up, allergic reaction lips, they draw a picture of a different (yellow) face over their own with $1,000 worth of Kim Kardashian makeup, they vocal fry sounding like Cobra Commander, probably have a tattoo sleeve for no reason other than they saw someone else with one and thought they'd be cooler with one, they spend 18 hours a day staring at their selfie camera and checking IG likes, and then talk about how they won't date any guy who isn't over 6'2", doesn't make over a quarter million a year... Something went hideously wrong.
That’s how it should be 😌💕👍🎥
American Harry Potter
Dog she's already pregnant 😅
im 4 foot 7 i never seen anybody shorter then me who wasnt 10 years old
the talk show girl was so charming
Yuh girl was insufferable.
Non-men are by far the most shallow & empty headed people I have ever come across.
just throw the magic bean outta the window and watch him grow
Yuhhhh
Dang i would if picked the first girl
Does anyone has the Instagram of Katrina
Man I really need a 7 foot girl in my life
Is this airack?
8:33 stop being so dramatic, you look like the idiot.
if this gets 1 million  likes i will shave my head balled
6’2 girl is kinda a bully
Laura was so damn cool.
Girl number two was not intimidating. Typically, the only type that has the balls to talk to me.
Im hoping he and kayla dated afterwards😊
only feminist in that room... Weak
The best choice! Well done!
6"9 Muscle Mommy fucking gorgeous
really wholesome video, I love it!
this guy is awesome, I wish him the best of luck!
There’s no way he’s 5’3
dis is szit
Laura is born to be a tv host
Hes so tiny, he could be italian. :D
He looks like Ben shepero and sounds like him lol
Somebody find the 2nd girl with all the tattoos and the 5'10 Girl with the tattoo on her Leg....i need they INSTAGRAM 👍👍👍
Jolly Green Giant was hardcore hating on Sam.
this would have worked better if he could make the decisions after meeting all of them... also dude could have gotten laid from at least 5 of them if you played it right.. especially the second one... she was willing to see if he could throw her around.. it would have been enough to get her naked.  and the one who was in love with a short guy would have stalked him for life if he just started it going..
You have the best pizza sauce
If they don’t like short guys,why did they come and they could’ve just said no before they started talking????
Should I said eeee                           e                            Eeeee   Bbb.                 E     Nnnnnn nn.    Eeee
I'm 5'10" and height definitely matters. I won't go under 5'8".
why on earth would you put a chair like that up for that little people girl... lol lucky she didn't face plant
How tall is beans? Seems like a cool person lol
all i see is humiliation
What a STRONG personality.
10:55 you did him dirty😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
His girl that he choose looks like Sophie dossi
2:13 most conservative ? how’s that any good
I’m almost 12 I’m 4.6 and my brother is a 8th grader he is 6 foot and has a friend who is 6.3
1:51, what? He barely seem to be that "tall" himself.
THE LAST ONE MADE GO OAIDJCHSJAOXJJDIEKAMXJVOSJWNRIVJ🎉
I don't like the term short king, I'm just a short guy period
I am 5 feet 6 and feel short af.. Imagine how short beans must feel.. I would have given everything to be 5 feet 8.. Just 2 inches would have made me satisfied
2:00 wtf dude.. it doesn't matter if a woman is short... she's a woman... feelsbadman for the first one. As long as she's shorter than you. even by 1cm it's a good match.
I would have gladly thrown around the second one and I'm not much taller
I'm 5'5" 12 years old, FEMALE!!!
SHORT
The chosen girl in the end was indeed a very very pretty one :)   I bet she can get any guy she wants.
The funniest thing is that people from my country are always amazed how incredible short Americans are.  :)   The tall girls from this video would be considered normal height in The Netherlands. The guy being 5 foot 3 inches would be noticed as extreme extreme small. He would need to buy his cloths in the children section. Edit: well ok 6' 9'' is also tall for a Dutch girl.
13:15
Tats... gag...
He is handsome for me.
Im bald and im really not sure what is worse. Beans has a great hair line but is short. IM 5'11 but bald.   After this im thinking id rather be bald.  30 percent of these women dad were probably bald so they are used to it.
does beans have a yt channel? he seems like a really cool guy
You’re perception of MY My world is Wrong.
Number 2 would of twist him into a pretzel 🥨
6.9 chick all day long, if only she didn't have a kid.
He should have picked the second girl in the red dress. The first girl was cool too.
Reapect for short kings and tall Queens ending up together whenever
Just because he is a short king doesn’t mean he can’t attract girls in fact I’m grateful that I’m 5,2 at 13
This dude has absolutely no fcking game.
Looks like you could use some help
short genes are not desired, they are seen as stepback in evolution in the eyes of women
Its like that troll from trolls and the tall wife
dude is really short but said he wouldnt date a girl under 4'11?
That 8th girl was very annoying. She's the type of girl I'd approach and start talking to, just to make an excuse and leave hoping I'd never run into her again.
Why do these women care about height?! Granted I'm only 5'2", but I do not care about height at all.
Bro has great friends
Im literally 6'4" and need a boyfriend  lol help
Bro fought demons his whole life and conquered them all. Not even half of the most beautiful people in this world have his confidence, bro won against all odds. Total inspiration for everybody💪
I’m 5’8. For me height is not a criteria when it comes to find a soulmate. It’s more about the soul. It’s the same for weight. I do look the style and if the man is creative.
"What if I wore platforms?" 😂😆 I love Beans
9:55 yuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i wish i was shorter, so that i could date a tall queen and feel ever shorter than i am aroud her u_u
10:59 Watching a snuff film...
I’m 6’5” and I only date women either taller than me or under 5 foot 😊
I Dont think so bean is 5,3.he looks more shorter
Out of the 3. That first girl was absolutely stunning. And the middle one was also so cute.. the last 2 looked bitter at the end tho lol
Garlic for hemmys
This is so much better then Jubilee! There no wokeniss in here!
Dam i am 6 feet about my dream is a little girl man jesus dude what a beauty the first girl!
The 1st woman got booty 😍
Imagine this mf if he was 6'2 , literally ultimate chad mogger
JESUS AND GOD LOVES EVERYONE SO MUCH TURN TO THEM BEFORE ITS TO LATE
Bean is an absolute cutie
Amen bro, keep up the humor and attitude, they come and go
I’m only interested in short guys so i’d be killing it in this one
WHO GIVES A DANG!!! HEIGHT DOES NOT MATTER. PERIOD. IT IS IGNORANCE THAT STANDS IN THE WAY
Idk why but that boston chick was lit! 🐺🌙🌙🌙
"my son is 12, he's taller than you" DAAAAMN lmao
so when are they gonna eat some hot sauce? lol
Our guy was confident throughout it all
I did not know beans is that short
Him denying a girl for being too short is crazy!
*Yuh*
the one with Blazer was waaaay better
Ngl he should have said yes to the last girl instead of the 6'2 girl
I love Tall women, I would pick the 6’ 9” woman even though she has a kid
calling him out on interrupting the convo was good
As a 6,1 lady … i would take him in a heartbeat ! Hes funny, charming, charismatic, kind and seems easy to talk to. Beans ! Hit me up.
Old luv worked in health care & she’s advising *baby powder* ??? Wtf man!??? Hell nah.. the treatment is literally in the name brah.. “haemorrhoid cream.” 🤦🏽‍♀️
He is so handsome 🥰 go beanssss
WHY NO TO THE TALL GIRL, GAMN SHE CUTE MAN WTF BIG MOMMY HELLO
12:26 , brutality at its finest
After #1 I hoped EVERY girl rejected him hard. What a douche.
Bro Beans is so cool
I'm 5'11 and most women think I'm 6ft I've never had a hard time getting women.
I'm 5'11 so I love my height never felt insecure about my height.
Maddi got that junk in her trunk
3:14 who it the girl? Insta?
He ditched the first one with an awesome phat backside.  He should be seeking dudes instead
He’s just terrible on choices. 6’9 was a match
OMG i brutally love the first one's voice. You would expect a tiny voice, but... wow... definitley this is a match for me, no matter what.
She won in round 1 and solidified it in round 2
11:27 that was so disrespectful
"Awww, that's cute." GAME OVER. FATALITY.
Yo Maddie compact with a DONK on her yo
I kinda dont like the vibe of girl who was 5'11 cuz she acted  so weird with him like GIRL WHATS WRONG BE NICE.
That dolphin edit cracked me up
7:34 - for anyone wondering, he claims he's 5ft 3, but I doubt it very much. He looks 5ft 1.
so how tall is beans??
in reality none of the girls would have dated him seriously
you guys stop doing this, even the hosts are rude and insulting and that one girl, not acknowledging the complement.  eye opening
yeaaaaaaah
Bean is cool af i wanna get a beer with him
Pause at 4:51   2,4,5,6,7 are a yes with 4 and 7 being the dream.  1 and 10 absolute no  3,8,9 are decent but just no super appealing.
I’m 5”3and I date  taller women. I could honestly say that being able to throw them around is a big deal as long as you can do that you’re pretty much in, now I prefer 58 but 5”10  I found recently is incredible. Yes  you need to hit the gym.
Na the 5/11 girl is stoned as fuck 🥴
HELP I’M CRYING ALL THE 5’11 GIRL SAID WAS, “Yuhhh”
It's kinda funny because I'm 5,7, and 13
Damn I'd date each of them.
I am 5.6 feet male and short king but I am from asia 😂
I am 5.6 Man , am i short?
If someone don't chose you because they are afraid of what other people are thinking, you just dogded a bullet.
::::::::::::  10:53 ( till 11:00 ) 😂
Can we get an update on Beans?
bro looks like a mix of Daniel Radcliffe and Seth Greene
So weird. The most attractive person actually had the nicest personality as well.
Sam and Laura had chemistry. Also that girl woth the brown outfit looked genuinely upset she didnt get picked at the end
You call him short king. but He's taller than me. I'm 160 cm
I don't get why they bring disabled looking short girls. there are lots of girls who are shorter but have good proportions why don't you bring them.
Beans is nice and was a gentleman yes but rmr he said he also wanted no less than a specific height 💀
Anyone know the song right at the end? I swear it used to be an animation meme
J
is it just me or does he look a bit like Daniel radcliffe ?
Short guys are sexy but im tall for a girl and thry tend to be mean to me.
Torque? LMAO
Mini jake gylenhal
I am 6'1
Disappointed he rejected the first girl, they looked cute together
Tall women are mostly pretty rude like they think being tall makes them superior and I can tell you most tall men don't even want tall women
Im 4’8”, and my height has always been a factor, ironically a positive one. Guys seem to like short girls, the short kings need more love! I would love to date a guy whose 5’3” or even shorter. I get that it would be awkwRd for him to date a woman whose 6’9” but it shouldnt be as much of a deal breaker as it seems to be. Its not fair especially since we all have insecurities. Im sure those taller women have their own issues. Gotta give a shout out to my fellow short kings and queens🙌🏻
Dude this sh!t was funny AF!
Hahahahahahahaha fool really said "I have alotta torque"..
I'm 5'7 , i use to prefer taller guys but when i think about my kids, I'll go for short guys 😅 I don't want my kids to be Giants
I wonder who he is and how he’s doing noe
I’m 16 and 5’3 so I hope I have luck with women
As a shorter 5'5" dude, Laura was a real one. The dude that broke her heart dropped the BALL.
I was 5 feet 11 once but now I’m only 5 10  -  40+ years does that  😂 But whatever my height I would  have agreed with your choice. She’s gorgeous and she seems to be lovely also. I’m not going to call you gorgeous but you seem a damn nice guy. I don’t know if a relationship came from this, sadly it probably didn’t. But if it did, I wish you both a long and loving life.
Girls are not looking for a taler Guy compared to her….they want a guy that is taler compared to other guys to defend her.
What he Said at the end lmao
That stoned girl was disgusting.
Kayla is sexy asf
Bro is mental. The first one was an absolute 10. She need to holler at me.
He is like Daniel Radcliff v 2.0 .
I realized the best way to test a woman's character is to have her go on a blind date with a short guy. Let's be real that really brings out their character and as good as these girls look that response just shows how scathing they are. Her real character comes out here.
How did I get here?
The last one isn't 6'9 lol
Just hook up Beans with a 5 feet filipina
the woman for him was second full stop, Short people always want tall people, because they are frustrated with heights!
Why are you guys still measuring in foot and inches? Are you living in the stone age?
The second choice
Partner in crime type shit, that lady is the vibe
I googled him and he is NOT a king. In no country on the planet.
What is seth green doing here
Ha! This was funny. This Beans guy is cool beans. And as a short king myself who's dated women both shorter and taller, I'll repeat what he said - what if I don't care? We usually don't. But women care a heck of a lot about it.  - Also, that "yuhh" girl was weird and needed to go and it had nothing to do with her height.
Miss 5'11" is either B͇r͇a͇i͇n͇ d͇e͇a͇d͇ or a complete schmuck...
I'm average in height, being short would literally suck. Though I only date Christian women of God.
1/2 of those chicks are even too tall for an average height guy. 😬
Kayla was thinking about him. Ev else thinking about themselves. Shes a keeper!
Most definitely, any girl in her early 20s are going to ignore men like Beans. They’re only gonna come back once they’re in their 30s with a couple of kids and looking for a good man to settle down with.
12:13 she must be protected likea top 3 NBA lottery pick. She's capable of giving birth to a good few of them, literally. 💯
Woman TaT's  no thanks we all know where she been
ahhhhh the girl in the brown jacket was the one who really liked him!
That was weird.
women don't even know what height is, they just go 6' and think that's short, they want over 7'. 5'5" average height for 80% of the world. that is called Normal not short. 6' is not average its a small minority of people. they are delusional and want the devils numbers.
What is the point of this?
Shorty's a playa!!😂
is it me who heard that indian bollywood  song "nadiyo paar"  in slow motion in the background at the end💀💀
He picked an absolute queen
Now do one about guys rejecting fat girls
I gotta know if beans ends up dating that girl 👀
I refuse to believe Beans has any issues with the ladies. He is crazy cool.
This is like one of those tv show cliffhangers, you have to wait until season 2 too see if they ended up dating 🙂
That 6’9” girl is beautiful! She seems very sweet too
Anyone get "Ben Shapiro" vibes from this guy?  Kinda...Kinda resembles....Maybe...No Dis....
MOAR BEANS
Women over 5'9 start to look manly (even have deeper voices), women under 5'0 start to look like Gnomes.
I hate the term "Short King", like "Black is beautiful", the people claiming it for themselves don't believe it, otherwise they wouldn't need to say it out loud.  Tom Cruise doesn't call himself a "short king", Gabrielle Union doesn't base her beauty on her skin colour.
also, lost at the 8 min mark... keep on, on keepin'
set design criticism, table cloth should be dark grey, stools should be brushed metal, and lighting needs shadows... also, key the look, bounce the shadow... cinematographer opinion, please don't hate me.
short "king" 😂😂😂
The right  hight comparison man - woman is that mans nose should fit into womans clevage (without high heals).
how in the fuck is nobody taking note of the intro video they gave the 9th girl? No wonder she was so stand offish, she could feel the energy in the room, and it definitely wasn’t safe for the women of color. She does not deserve to be implied with an aggressive nature, and quite frankly the way she was portrayed strictly seems like it’s bc she’s black, that’s what the editors mind went to, and they didn’t think twice about it. The masculinization of tall, dark skin black women NEEDS TO STOP
'What if I care?' *Double taps the reject button*  Ok can we officially recognize that women have a fragile ego and by far and wide society is pretty damn good at protecting it?  Oh and the eventual winner was an entire vibe. Every man's dream inside and out. That's how women should flirt. But as it's shown here a lot are clueless.
all those girls are out of his league
5:50 the eye chico, they never lie.
What’s the name of the song in 11:54?
Geez, Just use cm for sake :p
the dude around minute 10 came to only cockbock.. he looks like a moor, cant believe women would be into those type of dudes lol
I would have picked the number 8 (5'11 girl in green dress) and the 10 (6'9 girl), the third one would be anyone from the 4 to the 6th, probably number 5 or 6, all of them around 5'8
Wtf since when did Jim started doing YouTube???
He messed up. Shoulda chose the girl in the jacket she was actually into him.
JFC. That was brutal. I am so glad I am 6' 4. That was just painful.
Short people got no reason Short people got no reason Short people got no reason To live  They got little hands Little eyes They walk around Tellin' great big lies They got little noses And tiny little teeth They wear platform shoes On their nasty little feet  Well I, don't want no short people Don't want no short people Don't want no short people 'Round here  Short people are just the same As you and I (It's a wonderful world) All men are brothers Until the day they die  Short people got nobody Short people got nobody Short people got nobody To love  They got little baby legs They stand so low You got to pick 'em up Just to say hello They got little cars That got beep, beep, beep They got little voices Goin' peep, peep, peep They got grubby little fingers And dirty little minds They're gonna get you every time  Well I, don't want no short people Don't want no short people Don't want no short people 'Round here
Short People https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bfyS-S-IJs
Yeah the girls taller than him were just being nice because they’re in the public eye 💀
I keep thinking about if he had a kid with that last girl would their child be tall or short 😅
It never began for this mf! 😢
God damn, the last one could snu snu me to death.  I never thought about dying like that, but I really hope I will.
What is his height?
The 6’2 girl is for the streets
Women literally only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting.
why are all these girls that cares so much about height here.. he is not the one choosing.. they are.. .
3:20 she looks exactly like olivia rodrigo
5'11 girl is an ass. "you're beautiful" "true", like, instant no from me.
yuhhhhh
It's crazy how these girls egos get crush by a button that says no lmfao green outfit girl had to press it and beanslet them pick because he knew that their egos would hurt if he pressed no😂😂 5'3 but he gotta big D
Are you sure 2 wasn't a porn star? She was sketchy. If I met a girl with tattoo's who right off the bat told me she liked to be tossed around my flag would get thrown.
Dude said 4'11" 💀 What's he like 5'2"?? Can't be too picky lmao
y u u u h
Bean should date a guy. Gay men would love him
13:21 I feel like im watching a Lord of the Rings scene, Beans is a hobbit and the woman is an elf 🤪
👍👍👍
To all Americans with Hemoroids I advice changing your diet. Also start going to the toilet like we are suppost to, do not sit but squat and I understand this will be hard with ''modern toilets'' but if your skinny like me you can sit on the toilet seat with your legs and still get the squating position. This is how we are suppost to go to the bathroom. They still do it in Asia and many other continents and countries. it is less straing on the insides. When using normal toilets you have to strain to get the poo out and this will make the problem worse.
Do the chocolate city version please. I’m 5”6 3/4 without shoes.
3rd one was cuuuuute
He rejected those first two girls for utterly frivolous reasons. "You're not 4'11" seriously? You're like 4'6 yourself
“I need to be tossed around” A gorilla is 5’5 and would toss NBA players like anorexic schoolgirls
I would simply stack them on top of each other to make a superwoman
Jim you left the office and Pam to do this kind of stuff uh
The 5,11 girl was annoying “YaHhHhH”
The girl in the green dress is such a weird person🤮
Next video: Large Queen dates 10 men from fattest to thinnest
he looks like a mini daniel radcliff cause fof the facial hair lol
yuuuuuuuuuuuh yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh yuuuuuuh yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Im a 5'3 male and i dont really care about my height. When i first saw bean i thought he was like 4'11 but turns out hes my height. It was honestly funny seeing how short we are.
you shouldve invite more under 5 feet
i knew she was gonna win, its human nature your gonna pick the hottest women who is into you, the other women had no chance.
The last girl, Ekaterina, I have never laughed so hard in my entire life at the part where she puts the glasses on and then says he is at her boobs, then the animation of Short King(Beans) eyes and face, I was inconsolable for probably 15 minutes laughing, I nearly passed out.  Great work guys, cant beleive I never found this channel sooner!!!!
They way him and the chosen girl laughing is literally the same just killed me. Check the last minutes of the video 😂😂😂
Funny that most tall guys I know like shorter girls
I am not the cancelculture - police but this is real shaming for both sides.. i hope nobody who saw this was hurt after this 😧
Damn that Maricela( 5’10) with the neck problems 😍😍😍
Im a woman and hes taller then i am . Im 4ft 11 never minded being short. Lol. Theris been a few taller women try to make fun and i put them in their place lol . Married for 15 years 3 kids 36 and happy lol. Also my hubby is 6ft tall.  My one and only boyfriend fiance and husband lol .
7:13 & 8:12 this is called gaslighting lol
My mom is 5’3
HOW TALL IS BEANS?
Shortie girl was.. oof 🤤
Always keep in mind, heightism is akin to racism.
Rip metric system
8:55 pretty sur i saw her on pornhub lol
Yuh is 🗑️
To answer the question that everyone is asking themselves. Yes... Yes I would.
YUH
I feel his struggle  what a great guy and he made the right choice with the lady that he ended up with she's absolutely gorgeous and had all the right answers.
The yuuhhh girl is definitely a Bru girl
He's a really cool guy. He needs to bump up his style a little an he will be golden!
As a 5’10 gurl I would date beans
The girl in the green shirt that was 5’11 would cheat on ANY man so damn fast….that’s the vibes I got from her
Should have had them stand at the table the whole time. The stool helps to equalize heights.
I can't believe he said no to that big-bootied, blond little momma. She is CUTE.
The first girl sounded like she was crying while saying nice to meet you too
Is this just re uploaded on to a different channel
I just want to share something and let you guys know and also to bing these taller girls back down to earth. Any girl over 5ft 8in is basically built like a man and she will be taking man s#its in your bathroom. When you walk in and smell that smell of a 250lb fat dude in your bathroom and realize it was your tall girlfriend it will be a shocker. Taller girls have larger guts and intestines and produce some really gnarly turd. Ive dated really tall and short  women, so i thought I would provide a community service to you all and so you know its not always worth it😂
And then they all fucked
Beans is cool. “I got a lotta torque” lol
Except for midgets and dwarfs, height doesn't matter to me.
They're all shallow women.
I love how the ''Most Replayed'' in the video is just after the ad
Ladies, dont be height supremacists 😅
How tall is he?
how tall is beans!!
Im 6'3  and #1 can go for a ride no problems 😅
Bro thats the fucking lorax 💀
How come 2nd girl is 5'3" and third is 5'5" still third girl looks way taller than the second one
Bro is shorter version of harry potter
Yuhhhhhhhhhh trueeeeeeeee 🥴🥴🥴
Bro is Harry Potter literally xddd
i am 6'47
Death by Snu Snu.
Thank god im 5 ,11 didnt know i looked that long by the way highet dosent effact it but i have a huge shlong
I'm tall but there are perks of being a short king. One for example, women hardly find you intimidating and often times they want to cuddle you like a baby, hence the insta-hug on the first greeting. You see, tall men would be like getting a handshake or at most a cheek to cheek greeting.
THERE IS NO "TH" SOUND AT THE END OF THE WORD, HEIGHT!!!!   Why would you do a whole video saying the word wrong lol   🤣🤣🤣🤣
he's like a short gary sinise
The dolphin was perfect. lol
women: 2' guy: 5' 2"  women: too short
We need the same video with different "size" women. Let's see the all hurt feelings then.
Oh yes thats right, body shaming is completely fine when coming from a women. 😂
About 7 of them were thots.
he got crapped on for choosing early but in the end he didnt even need the 3rd one and could spare it to get away from that painfull convo
“Yuhhhh” “truee”💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Kira is pretty... But SHE probably can't find many guys taller then her... XD
All the girls are shorter than me 😮
How tall is beans?
Maaaaan that 6’9 hug! Trying to avert his face 🤣
super cringe how he takes all their bs
Anyone got the IG of the 5'10 girl?
My wife is taller than me. I think the key here is let attraction and personality do their job. I naturally gravitate towards taller people. I don't know why, I just do and I don't question it. However, I don't let that height difference turn itself into a kink, nor do I bring it up. I find that if you are comfortable with your height and don't make comparisons, you will help others to overlook those physical differences. Obviously this isn't always going to happen, and that is okay. Just don't be a shitty human and hopefully the rest will fall into place.
Def from Boston
Beans your amazing man your nice and funny thanks for being you!
the end when beans talks about his nipples I CANT BRO
Give me all the tall lady leftovers
He's a handsome dude, also I like the girl at 4:00 she's both stunning & beautiful personality but all of them were beautiful. I also like that last gal as well she seemed nice but yeah kayla seemed cool, she's the best friend/wife material.
you're beautifull : trueeeee lmaoooo
bro please do these kinds of things somewhere other than LA, it's a culture there
short kings gotta say like did you play god of war b?
That little dude should have picked number 1 because she is shorter then him.
Wtf did this small dude just reject the girl.. from being too much smaller than him wtf
Only the 2nd girl and you're already up to 5'3"??  Dude...  You didn't calibrate this experiment well.
He is so small
Bro i could never be sam im 13 and im 6 foot tall
He dated before?
🇨🇦😎💫❤Pierre Polievre is my guy. 110%    Freedom.......   Farmers
🐂💩
5'9 chick is what we call..and alpha widow.
10:36 bro missed it
what is the name of the song at the end of the video
I'm too short, you're too high. Let's both skip the ride 🥰
Me 5.4" watching 😢😢
everyone loves beans
hes so funny
Aubrey @ ?
Beans seems alright, these other two come across young and are trying too hard.
I have NEVER understood why this many women find height a deal-breaker. It's so stupid and shallow to me. Granted, I'm a 5' 2" woman and most people are taller than me, and if I had any aesthetic preference it's short kings, but I've dated men everywhere from 4' 11" to 6' 5". Beans is legitimately attractive, both personality and appearance. The girls concerned about a number are fools missing out.
As another short king who is about the same height as beans, where do you shop for clothes?
Where do you find these girls? A modeling agency?
I’m 6”3😪I want a woman taller than I am
Джарахов на максималках
Hands down would have chosen the first girl. 😅
Why are they saying he's nervous, he looked pretty calm
5'7 is tall enough man
3
Wait did I miss it or did they never say how tall he was?
the middle one is the one big mistake see you in gym
Beans is such an smart and creative dude, cool and sympathetic... I really had a great time watching this show. I hope everything went well after it.  Best wishes!  Subscribing. I hope we will be see Beans in futher videos here!
Green shirt girl sucked
That 5'11 chick was funky. Her ego and personality was quite unsettling
Introduce me to Aubrey! please?
14:47 I guess we all know which woman is going to remain single for a long while jajaja.
straight people continue to amaze me every day
Everyone's talking about what a great guy he seems to be so let me be the one to point out he rejected the one girl who was shorter than him based purely on her height and then every single girl after that had no real genuine interest in him.  People like to look good on the internet and say height doesn't matter but then put no effort into convincing the audience that they really mean it.
Girl 2 was almost perfect
Red dress stripper girl is trashy... FFS..  Lip Injections are a war crime.
Have I got it correctly that you call "beans" short guys? Is it rude or normal? I am not a native speaker, and I would be grateful for your answers) 🙃
This guy is delightful. I'd like to make friends with him.
why there's a term for a short king but not a term for fat queen.
10:58 LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The 6'2" chick has such a bad attitude. Who would even be interested in her...
The one in the middle looked genuinely disappointed she didn't win
No offence but is 5'11" on sedatives
There is something very attractive about a confident man, regardless of height.
The girl in the middle, at the end, seemed to be do disappointed he didn't choose her. :D
The 6'8 lady is super hot and chill.   I would go out on a date with her even if I got a lot of chuckles.
This is a recurring theme among women who don't want to date shorter men. They always say "what if I care". This happened to me in a high school when I tried to date a girl only an inch taller than me. She claimed, "what will other people think?". Remember your height says more about the girl than you.
“Show has been canned” 💀
Watching this is so weird. No one cares about personality or chemistry it's all about looks. Are they looking for an actual relationship or just a 1 night fling?
Beans is really 5’8
who's the 4'2 girl
why are short dudes called short kings?
He keeps saying "heighth" wtf is that?
Beans chose well. She seems super charismatic and is very attractive 🤯
I just love Beans personality.. He is the sweetest man I ever saw on internet.😍🥰
amusing.. liked it.. as a 6"1 man I prefer short(er) women. (it's a cuddle thing)
I dont know why girl 10 looks and sound like lady dimistrecu from resident evil village
11:15 - 11:31 👎🏾
10:53 - 10:59 😂 that shit was gold 🥇
That guy needs haircut so much
Woman nowadays! 😂 Bean is the man! 💪🏻
His confidence, voice volume, all shot up by the rnd of this video.
Wow women are beautiful. Unless there mean. Fudge you. But no i gotta forgive you. Oh gawd...
What happened to that girl beans met on the 30 day seiries?
Bruh he's not nervous at all tho stop saying that all the time lmao
Where do yall find these fine women damn
yuuuuuh
I love his vibe and open he is with people... Even those that are showing some snooty behaviour... Shows good character, tbh that's what count in a relationship, too..
Bro went in 5’3 and pulled the baddest girl there
song ?
My question is why do people in general care so much 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Give me my fucking centimeteeeeeers
Seeing how he prefers taller girls, Beans has DEFINITELY beated it to that Resident Evil vampire mommy.
Laughed ny head off and fell in love with the last one. She`d be the tallest girl I`ve dated anfirst taller than me. (Tallest ex is mother of my  child. 190 as me and daughter is 188 when 14..) Sadly I`m on the other side of the planet.
Yes was actually very entertaining
Good choice..
" you dont want a girl say you' re cute " period.
That’s like the best presentation of how much weight confidence has in attracting and handling a woman. Let that be a lesson guys
Yuhhhh
So, did they get married or what?
Should've accepted the 1st woman.
This is actually sad, sam you’re a good dude. And short guys have it the hardest
Anita tho...
How tall is he?
I feel like there’s a reason the host of of this show is not the main focus of all these vids. He has had no charisma, stage presence, or any real personality. The Beans guy was great and was ready to write him off as just some awkward guy but he’s got it. Receding hairline host does not.
m8 the second woman's shirt is see-through lollll 2:07
Beans is easily one of the coolest guys I’ve come across. That combination of humor, confidence, and kindness (even when he’s being rejected rudely) is incredibly impressive. I’m sure he does very well with dating and that the height doesn’t hold him back
That girl with the red shirt and black pants is stupid, so she's judging a whole group of people based on one person
Like a tall guy wouldnt break her heart, what a SHALLOW woman. I am a short man myself, and  I had two ex GFs who asked me out.  I would have married her, but she let her friends and mom talk her  into breaking up. She is now divorced from a 6 foot tall dude and 3 kids. The other was a military brat and had to move away. She could have been the one too.  Green shirt girl is not as beautiful as she thinks she is. So ugly on the inside.............AND cant handle rejection.
The third girl kinda looks like olivia rodrigo
They put out a stool for a 4.2 woman, what the fuck is this lol
no way his name is bean💀
I am 5'6 are me and beans good?
How tall is he?
My father was 5'3" and my mother was a stunning 5'8". They were married for 49 years until my father's death.
Beans is a beast! 5'3 but on his vibes he's 6'4
9:50 she's good at being a 2nd version of Billie Eyelash
Girl numb 2 would look so much better w/  her natural lips.
This was so weird to watch, I'm 5'10" and had a friend that became FWB who was like 5'3" maybe? He ended up doing something really mean to me and totally shattered my trust. Also not the first "short king" to treat me dirty. I think some men can't handle being smaller than a woman.   Good luck to this guy he seems very kind. :)
Short boys 👍✔️✅☑️
Uhhm. Don't know. I saw Beans's reaction to kayla's laughter at 15:29 and I did not like it. He seemed annoyed at her laughter, she tried to tone it down, he then joked about it and it seemed that he was just joking and having fun after all, BUT still. Check carefully her face from 15:37 on, she is not getting it. She went from making all smiles (maybe to disguise the disconfort or delusion) and then was all somber. It is obvious she did not like him telling her "what's so funny about that?".  From one side, I appreciate Beans' reaction as to being able to make others respect him. But from the other side, I think he could tend to dominate and control, to compensate the fact of his height. I do not like the fact of reprimand someone just for a spontaneous laughter - it was not so appropriate as he interpreted it. Manipulation and gaslighting? UHM!
100 percent the right choice 😊
Why you don't get rid of that stuff and use meters/centimeters? The rest of the world would understand also. Not only Usa and Liberia
Beans is in ted talk
To sum up this video: no matter what women say, hight is *ALWAYS* going to be important to a woman. If she says otherwise, she is lying to you. Because women expect men to fit the 6x6x6 rule at all times.
7:45 I agree with that girl. I dated a black chick back in 2002, and it was bad. All black women are horrible, no thanks.
It's stupid doing the "yes" and "no" until you've met them all first!
Laura is great, and she loves Jesus 🙂
Green shirt girl kinda sucked
So this guy is the same height as Wolverine.
Green shirt girl is slack-jawed.
How tall is bean?
Bring me that 4.2 lady
5:32  when the add stops
Air rack is the biggest industry plant on the planet
That check in the green looked weird, almost like drug addict weird.
Does Beans have an Instagram?
Why women just can’t admit that are weaker than men and they need a taller partner to feel protected?
First girl has had the 🍑
"What's your name?" "Yuhhh" "You're beautiful" "Yuhhh"
The whole humor was great but I wasn't ready for attack on titan 😂😂
So no one is gonna mention it ?
7:44 whats her ig ? Of Mara
That 5'11 chick is like walking xanax her "yuh'' response is just gross
So, did they date?
I’m using this video as a tutorial on how to pick up tall chicks. I’m 5’8” and want to date a 6’2” woman. I need to have that experience of physically looking up.
Bro the “scary” as in extra confident and sexually forward women, I think you have to take a hyper dominant role to match their energy. Yea I can toss you around, I’ll show you later, or some shit like that. I don’t even know if I’m strong enough lol.
6'9 That's sus numbers
i dated two girls 5'11, one who wore high heels at least 4' on our first date but surprisingly neither minded. we didn't kiss standing but everything else np. unless it's a huge gap, i wouldn't worry about it. height is given, not an achievement. the good girls know that.
Why is he called a short king and not a midget?
The attack on titan bit got me xD
I'm younger than bean but I'm taller than him as well
The men with the nude tshirt with razer headphone is so annoying
THE HEMORRHOID PART
None of them deserve him.
So the last girl was a friend of airrack's but he didn't even know that she had a 12-year-old kid🙈
6’9” woman is a sexy milf
Yuuuhhhhhhhh gross
Laura is annoying she shouldn’t have been on the show she just wanted to be platformed
the one who said i dont want to be seen next to someone so short.... it cringed me so hard that her only reason to be disrespectful was her insecurity what other think about her
Who was the third girl called Anita? Most impressive, to my humble sense.
3 good to me 1n 2 short generation
what camera glasses were used in this video? ^^
5’11 chick was not it mad disrespectful
HE can get all of them, he is Daniel Radcliffe
A lot of these girls are just staight up assholes
aint no way bo said no to the 6"9 amazonian 💀
LMAO :D https://youtu.be/8DkXhxi4UoI?si=lzRlW_KV0MwBVcPP&t=653
He picked the best of all. Good for him
4:15 The rizz on her. She's a cutie.
Tyler is always honest with his words LoL and Beans is just a sweetheart 🩵 I really hope he does find someone he can connect with❤ The girl he chose did seem like a good type for him. Who knows what can happen 😉 Best of luck Beans 💯
Green shirt girl was freaking weird.
He picked the hottest girl period, she would have been picked by most men, except the spinner who was probably a porn actress 😂
I vote for Kyla 4:05
Yuuh
Great guy. But he looks shorter than 5’3”
10:51 i think the right word was rude
I'm 5'8", my ex-husband is 5'4." He took me to this super fancy restaurant for my 18th birthday & of course I wore heels - the looks we got when we walked into the restaurant are seared into my brain. 😂😂
12:12. When you don't get hugs, but you do get breast-fed
The girl in green is a moron.
Same height as this guy maybe an inch taller. I wish I had his confidence.
Who's that 3rd girl trying to fool with all of that bullshite? And why did he give her the green light? 😂
That 5 . 11   or 180cm girl looks huge compare to him. And she is normal. God damn  he is a hobbit
you guys are humiliating people - house party what a joke .
I can confirm that I am shorter than beans and it is difficult to find true love or the person you love most of the girls are interested in tall boys 😢😢😢
His personality is golden that's for sure. Any girl would be lucky to have him.
There at the end you could see the one in the middle was visibly angry she wasn’t picked 😮
He says can't throw away a girl who's 5'3"?! Like do you even lift bro? I have never had issue tossing around girls, even ones a foot taller than me at 5'4".
The second girl was the best "well i hope we have tall children. Buy I love you"
Average american Woman is 5'4" So only the first girl was under that, and most of them were way way over.
Anyone know what shoes he has?
Kayla was amazing and Beans almost blew it, shit was wholesome :)
People are so shallow.
Wait....what??? Did I just hear a Bollywood song playing in the background at the end of the video???
second chick is a HUGE PASS for me, i needed like 2 seconds. Short or not, You don't date whores anyways. I'd rather date the dwarf.
It’s not important to him but it IS important to her. The difference is he doesn’t have many options to date shorter but she has every option to date taller.
1st girl is fire
The second girl has concerning prefrences.
7:34 Someone gimmie Laura's @ She's stunning!!!
cope
1:20 Understandable 5:42
There is no such thing as a short king
It has been years and I still don't know the name of the song
"A short guy broke my heart so no more dating short guys" Bro what?
7:52 yup, as expected she doesn't say anything about herself, like she doesn't even think about anything that she possibly could have done to have triggered the guy to dump her or whatever. Its always the guys fault right? Never the girls. A lot of western women man, they never even think, "maybe there was something i did that pushed him to that limit" or they will never admit, "I probably shouldn't have done...to him for him to do that"   Nahh never, "he did this, and that...he dumped me, he broke my heart"
this is so cringe...I don't know why north american people care so much about height is just strange. Is the same with race,is like they are so obsessed with while the rest of the world does not give a f about it.
Great video guys!
Laura needs therapy..
Girls are crazy bro. You can be tall, handsome and a good person and some women will still reject you. So you have to try to look for women that like you, ask them out flirt or whatever. Attraction for them is subjective while attraction for men is much more simpler.
Bruuh, that girl in green sounded and acted like she burned out her last brain cell on weed.
Jim Halpert?
3th girl was the fiendliest
In high school, one of the shortest guys was charming as hell, and dated nearly every popular girl from 2 different schools.
Harry Potter speed dating 😂
short king?? what a disgusting term, I'm going to start using fat queen. You go fat queens!
Re the 5' 11" woman in the green toga  sheet:  Sir, you dodged a train wreck and a headache of biblical proportions...and an STD most likely
Do not trust Russian women.
how did he pick the black girl, she was absolutely boring as hell and showed zero interest, wtf
I’m 5’3” too . I   was a collegiate wrestler I am a extra large short man I would guess beans is about 125-130 pounds. I’m 190 lbs I would look twice his size  compared to him.  most people think I’m like 5’8”  so it’s not just about height but size. He would be wearing small or medium clothes I wear xtra large   Even though I’m short I command any room I’m in. My friends all are large men over 6” tall on average but I was always the one you would athletically compare to I could out lift or run 99.99% of people in world in my prime
Im 7'3 And I Feel Taller Then I Am Now.
Im 6'2 And I Feel Tall Now L:D
A watch at the back of a phone is the dumbest idea ever...
Bro really said i have a lot of "TORQUE"
@Houseparty! Why are you not linking to the girl's instagrams? Get on it.
Kayla is so beautiful, and she is VERY sexy in that skirt, goddamn.
It will forever be disgusting how women shit on guys for being short. It's not a preference, so don't even defend them.  A preference is "I don't want to date this guy because he's fat." Height is something you have ZERO control over.
What a dweeb.
I feel like all these rando ppl are in Hollywood somewhere standing in a long line waiting for youtubers to grab for there social experiments/dating/clout gain/or whatever content.
Wow I enjoyed this Show man ❤
not the haemorrhoid rizz by Beans
the 4'2 the 5'10 and the 6'2 be my choose
My fav was definitely Mara. 💘💘💘
Most of the girls were very nice but Laura was the best💔
Bean's dynamic is friggin' awesome, you REALLY need more content with him!
yuuuuh
Do yall understand what a King and Queen are? Stop watering down the meaning. Everyone cant be kings and queens or else there would be no kings and queens. Clown world
hot !
Beans (I hope we get to know his real name) is the coolest guy ever. Someone like him deserves someone special. I hope he finds what he's looking for.
I need Ekatarina’s number STAT
Ice age eyes girl laura
Too many of these women were really rude for no reason. It was gross.
the 4 feet girl is Great 👁️👃👁️🙏
That *Indian song* at the end! Finally India is getting some recognition but the ones they are playing is a remix by a Finnish artist. Do give the original a listen. It’s called “Let The Music Play” by Shamur.
Wolverine from X-Men is 5’3. Sabretooth is 6’6. Last chick is taller than Sabretooth.
Yeah. His height is not the problem. His personality is not good.
Nice
raise the editor
Well...I would TOTALLY chose Ekaterina!
Next episode: Beans is dating 10 women with ascending nipple size.
Personally I like the 6th 1 from Armenia.
Terribly dirty shoes, strange that anyone wanted to meet with him,.
2, 3, 4 & 10
I am a 5'8 woman and have dated 5'1. The main issue to me is not a mans height, but mainly how he handles it himself. If he is angry at all women, spewing height-related hatred/misogyni I am out. But if it's not an issue to him its not an issue to me  This guy is charming. If he was my age I would be happy to date him. Love his sense of humour
This man is proof that's it's good to be King.
11:00  😂
this show fake as biden
1000% brown jacket girl
Beans' LAUGH 🔥🔥🔥
Beans is so funny and polite which is a rare combo these days. I really enjoyed this episode because of him.
The shortest girl was very cute!
Maddie is hot af and really sweet girl. Beans cocked it up immediately.
bardzo fajnie ale dlaczego nie podajecie wzrostu w centymetrach?
I would like to date the first girl (Maddie), someone know her? I mean ig, fb or other social media, she so cute
We're 4 girls in and we're already at 5'8" 🤨🤨
The winner was by far the hottest and the coolest!
Watched because of the thumbnail… stayed for the Pokémon game sound effects
You played let the music play by shamur in background
yuh
I'm a 5'4" guy. I think almost all of these women were pretty hot, but the girl he chose was also my favorite.
It looks like a mother and a son when the girl is taller. He have good taste i fuck f*** 2 and 3 too the others are below my standard
The guy in this video that looks like the child molester is obnoxious and gets a thumbs down.
Dude has a great personality, short yeah but I'm surprised he's single.
height and size always  will  be important thing in life no matter what they try to make you believe with blah blah blah it is a fact.
As a normal woman, they prefer to choose a taller guy. As a normal guy, he chooses the prettiest woman. 🤣
Bro, he literally rejected the first girl because she is too short. What a freaking hypocrite.
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE GIRLS FEEL! I EQUALLY DONT WANT TO BE SEEN WITH A FAT CHICK TOO! OR SMALL BREASTS OR UGLY LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO WASTE ON FEMALE REFUSE!
Only woman can date up, literally and physically.
His name is bones now
As a gay man I'm proud to say I like men of all sizes and shapes.
The average American woman is 5'3.7" . It was unfair to only have 2 women shorter than that.
In my opinion: 1) I would have said yes just for the caboose. 2) Tremendous amount of drama, but terrific sex until your D falls off. 3) Boring... next 4) Would say anything for approval not true to herself. Would still date to see who is the real person inside. 5) A little too blunt or honest, sometimes a little finesse goes a long way. 6) She got the best of both worlds, she got to be on the show and also rejected the man by being the victim. This one is dangerous move on. 7) Same as #5 but with a beautiful smile. She is very level-headed and can be a good friend. 8) She only cares about herself, zero empathy, it's great that she made the decision for you. 9) Me me me me me cause her expectations are not in her favor and she will be alone for a long time but then blame the world for not seeing the beauty within her and could possibly join a cult that hates men. 10)  Wow... he missed a fantastic opportunity, she is extremely nice and I don't really think she cares if he is shorter. His own insecurities made a bad choice.
He only has three choices so in my opinion he should meet all the girls before choosing.
No way the 4th girl is 5'8
As a short guy at 5'3 ben just boosted my confidence and give me the willingness not to give a f😂😊
short king, the expression, sounds absolutely ridiculous.midget, or dwarf sounds even more normal and less offensive. who the hell came up with this? him rejecting the first girl is also ridiculous. most normal height men have girlfriends as short compared to them as this girl is compared to him. this whole show is very primitive because of the character of the host and this guy. childish and primitive. i just stumbled upon it. will never be back. no need to praise everything just because it exists.
Bro has immaculate game
exp
The One In the green shirt - Not too much going on upstairs, Yaaar
I wish there was a weight filter.
I love how the glasses cam was abandon after 5'9 probably monetization But definitely the funniest part
Me being 5'11 thought me was tall but after seeing that 6'2 girl want to date someone taller i got my confidence grounded
Man is wearing Nike shoes with Adidas socks. Immediate deal breaker😂
This certainly doesnt debunk the claims most guys make about women and their height fetish.
11:14 - when you are 6'2 as a woman and you are like: "I only date taller men" then you' ll have a hard time finding somebody. So this woman has a very reasonable stance on hight in dating.  As far as i am concerned: If you find a woman capable of reasoning, marry her.       PS: Is this considered "sexist"? In my world we call that a joke but go ahead.
08:10 - ok. So when i made 1 (in words: one) bad experience with, say a black woman and from thereon i would have an aversion towards black women.... wouldnt that make me a racist?
05:40 - Did this guy just shittest a woman?! He truly is a king.
03:22 - "on a dating app..." - the fact that she is apparently quite active on dating apps is likely the best reason to reject her.
Kira is my hight exactly
Can we just stop call everyone King and Queen? That just doesn't make you special. There is only one king in the country... But anyway, better for me cause I'm an emperror!
The girl in the middle at the end seemed a bit sad about it
the second girl is taller than me
never gonna understand being rude to reject someone.
I really don't understand why you pressed yes for the tall black girl? It was so obvious that she was uninterested the whole time. Weird
Ehy did u go up in height so fast woth the girls...?? U could have gone 4.11, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, etc. not skip yo 5.5 then super tall ones
that Billy Elish like girl was absolutely rude, god truly gives good looks to the worst people lol
yuhh
The editing at 10:53 killed me 💀( I can't say anything, im 5'6 lmao)
How do I date the 6.9 chick?
How tall is beans
The name’s Potter, Harry Potter
Gimme their Instagram names please 😭❤🥰 I liked that video, i subbed instantly 😂💪🏽❤
his first yes, and the last girl. they are beautiful, but each in their own ways. love the girl he gives the first yes to. completely my type, sorted, nice, decent "conservative" fashion sense, and intelligent.
SI units please
Who beans
I'm becoming Curious about Midget Women how Good they  are  in Sex
She wants to be tossed around. How is that intimidating? 😅
How nice, with the dwarf girl he basically rejected her without discussing anything other than height.
I'm 5'4 and it's decent height where I live, but I didn't know I was this short until I looked at this 5'3 guy, really sad ....
If Harry Potter & Ronald Weasley fused & compacted
omfg this is honestly horrifying.  Like besides the shortest girl not one person on here didnt care about height.  I know lots of dudes care about height too, they wouldn't want a girl taller than them or just in general a woman taller than like 5'7 but like fuck, why does height matter so much to people. Like MOST people, not 40%, not 50%, literally like 80% of people I wanna say care about that so much.  And also wtf is wrong with some of the woman on here being so disrespectful to him just because he's short. Almost talking to him like he is inferior, fucking disgusting, especially that dumb bitch at 9:47
I thought i was tall but I’m 5’0
I was sure he was throwing with the hemorrhoids XD
Wow.. my favourite thing about this video was Beans!! Go Beans!! You are kind, funny, clever and awesome my man.
Put some round glasses on that guy and he would look like a short Harry Potter.
I only liked the 2 short girls he picked especially the middle one but she seemed like a snob. Good luck Beans. lol
If a chick puts her heels into her height thats a huge red flag.
Get this guy involved in every upcoming D&D movie. He could really work as a Halfling love interest / adventurer.
6'9 would be good if she didnt have kids.  Did they date after or nah cuz otherwise it doesnt mean a thing. You guys brought in a bunch of pog slop for him. The girl he chose in the end was the only one who remotely treated him like he was human lmao.
Not gonna find much sympathy if you reject the short girl.
YUhHhHhHhHh
Yuhhhhhhhhh
Yuhhhhhhh
7:19 leprechauns
10:30 textbook heightmogging
Is that Ben Shapiro?
america is growing some strange culture
what is this crazy concept?!?
Ive got a hemmy brah 😂
Im 6ft and my wife is 5'4 its not really different being tall 🤷‍♂️. I get made fun of for being dumb or shit like that when clearly its not the case. No one is free from scrutiny. My buddy whos short got married to a really pretty girl.
Y'all didnt need to shit on him for the dates lmao. This guy is an asshole.
10:20 If you love someone you wouldn't mind. Guess all her family, friends and people she mets are all tall too.
God....the Yuuuuuhhh chick. Take a hike.
That girl in the green shirt sounds stupid.
I hope they paid him well.
This was painful.
.<
I mean Kayla isn’t wrong he is handsome
Referring to a midget as "short king" is cringe
No way she's 5'5 and has a minimum req of 5'10. That's wild.
Red stripper dress = Psychopath
Girl in the green shirt was so annoying "yuhhh"
Women are wayyyy more shallow then guys this proved it
Giraffe with saggers ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
3:22 So she filters out all the short guys on dating apps.......but says it doesn't matter? Women are literally impossible.
3rd girl looked like Olivia Rodrigo
The only thing this host could comment on during this whole episode is how Bean was nervous or uncomfortable. Be more creative geez.
Yuhhhhh
my sister is 5'10 and im 5'3, very sad
He chose the good one, clearly.
I could actually feel my brain cells dissolving for every "yuhhh" and "truuu"
So do they go on a date?
black women is racist
Tallest girl is like a real life wonder woman.
Isn't short king like 5'11 now?
Nah but that 10:53 montage part... 🤣 I'm 5'7 but this part made me feel like a giant.
Confidence>looks>status>height>body.....prove me wrong 👇👇
whats the song from ending scene? please
Hell noooo they look Way smaller Than me and Im 5'3
How tall is Beans?
4th and 7th i love them
number 3 has the most beautiful face I've ever seen
the shirt is awesome "yuuuuuuhhhhh", am i too short for you? "yuhhhhhhhhh"
the girl who won is gorgeous my god...
beans is such a cutie
YUH SHUT UP
How tall is he?
girls can actually be evil man its tough
how tall is bean?
This moron should have picked the first girl
that little person was cute afff im a short man 5.5 :(
Hey I guess you could say to that guy for doing this…..”cool beans” 😂
yuhhh girl really doens't have much going on in her head does she?
why'd he make every one of the conversations about his height lmao
I was just thinking "damn he really is short, I must be towering over him in real life" and then I saw his height and realized 💀 he's the exact same height as me
it's so wholesome of beans to reject the first girl for his height that way we wont feel bad when he gets rejected for his 🤗♥♥♥
He's like a mini-me Harry Potter.
curly hair girl is a keeper
this video gave me so much confidence . thanks alot 😂
Nothing but superficial women. 🤮
This feels like bullying. I dont like it.
What a charmer! Beans is gonna land a really cool gal!
the 3rd girl, damn
By the third women in you are already above the average woman's height. The distribution of women you picked should've been better.
Axel thesleff right at the end good choice
The third one :D emotional and physical needs, but puts a filter to around 6 feet on dating apps.
Yuhh
Dump the kaali Ride with the goris  Anyone Indian/Pakistani here? They will know what I mean... xD!
whats the song at the end ??
Im 5 foot 7 its not that small, im male i like women about 5 foot4.
the 2 hosts are literal losers
Bro got the humpty dumpty truck
10:54 Attack On Woman
Idk what it says about me but the first girl was the hottest imo
The little person was cute and she had nice cakes.  He's dumb.
Daily reminder that women who unironically care about height aren't women at all but girls who never matured out of their teen years.  Keep on moving kings, find a woman who loves you for who you are, not bullshit, uncontrollable factors that don't actually impact the relationship
is that lady demitrus?
I like number 2, can I have her number? I'm 5.9

9:55 "You're beautiful" Truuuue Annnnd pass
There is something REALLY ATTRACTIVE about how the girl he choose brain works. It's really hard to describe...but I love her brain just went to "well I'd find a way to sneak you on!!" I thought it was like really lovely...and genuinely endearing if not a little silly, it was just, ahhh, perfect for me IMO. Really liked her, I love that type of thinking.
Bro needs to Ropemaxx
Wtf is a short king? 😆
is this jake gyllenhaal
10 pls
yeah height is beauty standard, but i have never feel superior on others who is shorter than me this is ridiculous, this woman seriously think she is better than him, not even taller dudes will try to deal with someone toxic like her !
Come to the Philippines and you're fine 😂
"dates"
I love the arrogant alpha presenter. Totally my type!
The little girl was thicc
Does anyone know 5"9 and 5"10 girls Instagram@??
it's nice to see how this poor man can be humiliated in this situation but if we changed the height with the weight and the man with the woman the result would be very different. imagine saying it would be strange to go around with a whale like you or look I invited my son and he weighs 1/10 of you. all this disgusts me. the video is interesting anyway and the boy had fun despite the fact that he needs a lot of willpower to accept his situation, take an example and stop playing victims
Its crazy tall women dont like short men. Im a taller man 6ft and i dont like tall women. Too masculine acting most times.
5’5” girl for those with taste
is nobody gonna mention how hot the 1st girl was? a Tiny Alura Jenson
2:00 Wait I'm so confused... he said the shortest woman he will date is 4'11"? First of all, who tf cares how short a woman is, every man only cares that she's not TALLER than him. Second, he's like 4'11" HIMSELF BRO WHAT?!?!?! It would be like me saying "sorry babe I only date women with a 225 bench." Please take a toaster bath my guy.
Fuck why do people support ppl like him
Brutal
0:12 where was this in the video? I rewatched their dating scene like 10 times and couldnt find it x.x  Edit: Is it just me or did Anita actually looked mad they didn't get picked at the end. ff.
Song at credits?
the  one in green with the reddish hair came across like a bee... so rude, and brainless with her "yuhs"  though she wasnt physically beautiful either in my opinion, so not good inside or out
ahh the first one was so cute..
60 years from now, you guys will realize how stupid this was... or you'll be dead
Now try whitout cameras
did the girl knew ahead of time all the details ?
Females generally  likes tall, older and suscceful men and Men likes shorter, young and feminine women. This is the cold truth about the world. Only in the west were we think men and women are the same is this a crazy idea....
remember, this is all performance., all bs for the camera. this nice guy has no chance in the real world with any woman taller than him unless she's terribly insecure.
He did the First Lady dirty
We are the same high 5'3 because I'm asian. Shorter people. 😂 so I need to find women the same high as mine. I don't need taller women because it looks ugly when short and taller dating are together.
The beautiful woman in the middle. She is mad because you didn't choose her.
I’m 5’10 my girl is 6’3
10:54 bro i died  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact this lil clown manlet dismissed the shortest chick is absolutely hilarious and claims to have a high MINIMUM of 4'11. LMFAO. Buddy is set to die alone
#2 is hottest
Damn son, never thought John Krasinsky’d do YouTube.
"Hi! How are you?"  "Tall."    Jokes aside, I don't think tall girls really like being tall.
last girl looked like she was having dinner with her little son 😂
Funniest zoomer editing
is he really 5'3
15:48 lmao this is so funny 😂
The girl in red was really funny. The interaction was great.
The second girl was having her bobas out and her buttocks was clearly in a thong lmaooo
He looks like the nerd from scooby doo 2. The one Velma dates
you heard it here boys 5 inches is not that much
Girls we gotta take notes (Im a male)
Kayla's personality makes her so much hotter than the others!
why do you hate centimeters so much?
It's nice that the woman who is 6'9" wasn't wearing heels.
Brootal Ropefuel
I like Katrina from her own channel! Her height looks very intimidating when she is sitting down. I bet it is very hard to find compatibility for people her height. Yeah, there are men who are 6'9 or 7 feet, but how many can there be and then she would still need to filter them out by their personalities.
we need an update :D
having him eliminate as the date goes on is WAY too unfair. at least have him narrow down to 3 AFTER the dates awith all women.. shitty format man
That "you guys" or "you people" always hits hard 😂😂
Kayla is the "ride or die" type of woman. So rare but so attractive..
Short king? 😂Lord farquaad?
Damn never expected I'd see a women that is 6'9 being 2 inches taller than my ass yet I'm 15😂
Jim from the office how did you get your own show?
Can I please hug Beans. Like omg hes so kind and gentle.
That tall dark woman was neither attractive or desirable.
5 11 girl looked so tall but shes my height lol, short king is really short
Using this pathetic imperial system is totally annoying. I will put dislike to any video who will use that. Why do you still keep use it? It is mental!
Small axe chop down big tree remember that
the truth is that short men and woman will never find true love. This is coming from me and im a 5'0 tall female whose been cheated on. so I rather cope with substance until I can finally terminate my life lol.
Can we get the @‘s
Why is Beans so cool? It's not fair that he's that cool. He should leave some of the coolness for the rest of us!
6'9 lady was hot  they should have made her wear 5-6 inch heels too to exaggerate things :O
hold awn cause im 3 inches shorter than him and i dont look THAT short i thought i was taller tbh...
That 5'11" girl😍
This is brutal, it’s so over bruh
Like watching T-Rex climb a stool
if short king is a thing, I want the saggy tits queen version
7:09 we already saw a girl not trusting men for HER past experience like that, right? That's baggage, that's you don't want a girl with 15 body count
The girl he gave the award, she is actually amazing and her vibe 10/10. The 2nd girl (middle one) is nice but seems to faking being nice. The 3rd girl, idk why he even pick her... they both had 0 connection bruh...
man, it's crazy how much emphasis we place on height.  like. . .fuck it's gotta be rough for hella short dudes--and this guy's god a great personality and he handles it well, can't imagine the ones who don't share his optimistic/carefree outlook.  it's kinda fucked up how automatically dismissive we are of short people, but i guess it is what it is =/
Daniel Radcliffe is that you?
Why do all the 5'3" peoples in these type of videos always look way shorter? I have several 5'3" friends and they don't look like they are 4'11"...
Ummm he’s kinda amazing js
mf Editor violeted this shit 10:55
10:54 bro I'm a fan of Attack on Titan I gotta say yes lmao
Who agrees that this person who own this channel is annoying press like
This interviewer is childish ... Goddamn he is annoying
This goes to show you that personality REALLY makes a difference here. I like taller women like the last three but the girl in the green shirt was so ghetto af I was like heck no get out of here. Most of these girls were either rude or boring, especially the ones with large amount of tattoos. I also noticed that the tallest and the shortest were the sweetest and I would date both but I really want to point out that the guys friend who hosted the show did an amazing job of picking a girl that he would like as a personality match once he vetted her looks. Really great job man. We all need wingmen like that.
So he rejects the first girl for being too short. What a hypocrite. That’s why I unapologetically only would consider tall men
i love that they all had completely different answers to the roller coaster question
I JUST KNEW HE WAS GOING HOME WITH HER😏
I think he went about this all wrong... I'm 5'5" and 45 years old. I've dated all kinds of women, and had solid relationships with at least three women over six feet tall. My first wife was 4'11" and my second wife is 5'6". I don't mind one bit, because when someone loves you, they make you feel ten feet tall inside, and as strong as a bull.
He 1 inch taller than me
Why does he keep saying "heighth?" Pretty sure that's not a word.
Kayla damn 😂 yeah the chemistry!
Beans/sam: thanks for making time for this her: yuuhhhhh Beans/sam: You’re beautiful  her: truee 💅🏼 Beans/Sam: really cool fashion sense  her: yuuhhhhh 9:55
As a European, who has spent years in the US, I have made the following observation. - American men are gentlemen, while American women have no class, or very little class. I understand COMPLETELY why American men are so popular all over the world, while American women aren't.  Simply put; the US has the best men, and the worst women.
11:01😂😂😂
The woman in the middle when 3 left. I think she really like him.
So short guys should stay off dating apps…No, ALL guys should stay off dating apps. They are basically menus for 304’s to order 🐓 from. You will never find anything of value. If you don’t meet someone in the real world they aren’t real.
What a Great Guy! Great personality
10:54 IS JUST FUCKING GENIUS I AM LOL FOR REAL
Man, who wouldn't choose Kayla?
Beans is jet pack joyride in real life 😂
I'm 5'11 n I have never been with anyone who's taller then me, mostly because taller guys always seem to want short females
I think it's crazy there are height filters on apps
So nice of John Krasinski to help with Daniel Radcliffe's love life.
The most attractive female trait is kindness. All men love nice girls.
Beans is a short king fs
“Your beautiful. True” I LOVE HER
Beans isn’t a short king he’s a king period💅
beans is trippin i  woulda def bagged the dwarf
I wish I was with beans
Why does the third chick (Aubrey?) look so damned familiar? Who is she?
Height dont really matter it's whether you're a pussy or a not  just saying just saying 🤷🏽
Man, I dont think I've ever witnessed such genuine charisma and confidence than what Beans is putting down. What an awesome dude.
Girl with green seems like a wonderful person
I'm a little under 6', 6", and 54 years old. I'm going out to a local Moose Club here in North Florida later tonight with my 78-year-old mother, as my "wingman", to hopefully meet the legendary woman who lives down the street from my parents in their 55+ gated community. I've had multiple people tell me that she's single, and "taller than you are". She's age 56, and apparently likes to dance at the Moose on live music nights. I gotta SEE this woman! ;-)
I don’t like how rude he was to the black girl, Tf.
Ok paused just to say his loss. That first woman was very pretty & down to Earth. I don't think height should matter.
I think this is the first time i've seen beans act so normal
I actually hate the "short king" title, but as a.... short king(174cm / 5'8.5) I think a lot of women betray themselves a little with the height obsession. *I say this because from experience I have never had much trouble picking up girls when I get to meet them in a non-dating setting first, like a party or a class etc. Because then they get to meet me as a person first, and consider me as a dating material second.* However the moment I go on Tinder it literally feels like I'm undeserving of feeling a woman's love! rofl:D The point is, it's not 10cm up or down that is going to give you long term happiness. *Just like any man who passes up a good woman because of 10kg up or down is a completely idiot.*
As a somewhat short guy myself at 174cm (5'8.5 in freedom units I guess) I totally understand why women like taller guys, and I have never had a problem with that in and of itself. *What I don't like though is how acceptable many women think it is to just blurt it out without any consideration, like of course she can't date a human being that is only 175cm, it's almost as if they are offended that you even had the nerve to put them in that position... :D* On Tinder for instance it's shockingly common to see a straight up height requirement in the description. You would not see, or at least it would not be socially acceptable for a man to do the same about any body measurement of a woman, nor should it. Ultimately I think what makes the height thing with women so rough for men is 3 fold; First of all it's an almost universal preference for women, secondly it's not just a preference for many, but a complete deal breaker too, and thirdly it's something the man can do nothing to change/improve, unlike fat, muscles etc. *Think about being in that position; that literally no other quality can make up for the fact that you lack 10 cm in physical height... that's quite brutal when you really think about it :/* With men's taste you don't really have an equivalent to that, you would be very hard pressed to find one trait that was a common deal breaker for almost all men, unless you're talking about extremes. Imagine for instance that for 80% of men, dating a girl with smaller breast than a _natural_ D cup would be a complete deal breaker. That would instantly make it very hard for _most_ girls to find love.  Again, I understand that it's a biological thing and I would certainly not blame any individual woman for pursuing her own preferences. *I just wish they rejected short men with the same sensitivity they would like to be rejected for a physical attribute themselves.*
Me personally, I'm confident enough with myself and comfortable with humanity that I have no height minimum or maximum... They're all fair game!
Height doesn't matter when you're horizontal.
The first girl he said yes to looks like Olivia rodrigo
Bro Ekatrina should date Chandler's older brother he's like 6'10 or something.
1 Rule to take home: Don’t judge a person by their height.
Women are too entitled. It’s really pathetic.
My partner and I are the same height as him 😅
I wouldn't mind going out with that 6'9 girl. Tall women (especially European women) are hot af
The girl that’s 6’9… IS SHE FROM GOBLET OF FIRE HARRY POTTER?
IDK but I'd definitely date this king 🤴🏼
4'11 seriously such a bad move lol
when he said im 5'10 i died laughing😂😂😂
I would choose the first short one. You can carry it with you in your suitcase.
YO IM A 11 YEAR OLD GIRL AND IM TALLER THAN BEANS
Looks like Gordon freeman is finally over with alyx
Hi Katerina,I have a question for you. If you were 5'7" would a height difference mater to you? If not how would you feel if the other person wasn't attached to short women?
I like Russian Girl but the other 2 Chickes before her were interesting to
Maddie's a baddie and Kayla fine
Elf dating a hobbit with that last girl
Yuh
YUUUUUUH 🤣
they made him look in this video like much less than 5'3. 5'3 is 160cm, very averange for most of girls also
Fun Fact: The Messiah from the Bible was somewhere between 5 feet and 5 feet 5 inches.   Bonus Fact: He was also Brown Skinned with Brown  Eyes. Because he was Middle Eastern. 😁
bro the 6 9 girl is on PH i seen her lol
I tried a short king and was very impressed. They are stronger than you think
Me and beans are the same height and I’m 19
15:44  wtf
I hope Laura gets trauma therapy for her broken heart.
Beans anxiety going through the roof*  Airrack using him to advertise
Man has game fr
"A girl that can advise me on my hemi...so sick"  'Oh, you have a car with a hemi?'  "Ummm, no."
2:21 this part looks so familiar, i dont know why
Am i the only one who prefers short guys on this planet??
but what's his real height please
A short guy is like a fat girl, no one wants you and everyone is mocking you.
I Always awkward but i forget i can be creepy 😂 😹. Is there a difference? Some are sweet and 10:00 some are bitter ;
I’m 5’5”, my husband is 6’1”. Our oldest is 5’3”, our youngest is 4’7”. Scientifically speaking, my oldest is done growing, as she is 15, but she may surprise me. My son is 11, so he still has hope.
This reminds of a story my dad told me about how he was 4'11 until his senior year of highschool and he dated a girl over 6 foot.    Let that be a reminder there's still hope out there for the short kings lol
the 5'10 girl was really hot
Stop talking about. Shopify.
Why he talking about his nipple wt the end tho 🤣🤣🤣 he is cute anyone with brains would date him. Find someone respectful, sweet and someone who will make you laugh no matter what! He is all of those
why was there more people rejecting beans then beans rejecting people. btw beans is such a nice and cool person this isn’t meant to be an insult
BRO the edit with Kiera 😂😂😭😭😂
I am always kind, nice, caring, and grateful to all short and tall women even I always think of them as beautiful as Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Jayne Mansfield all together no matter what hair color or style they have.
Loved Sam and Laura's talk show😆
When 2nd woman said "I like to be tossed around" I thought she said "I like to be the tallest one around" and that was her reason for insisting on wearing high heels😆
,, YUUUUH '' - Diana
I'm so glad I'm 6'3"
the girl he picked was the coolest of all of them, would have picked her myself.
am 6'4'' my shortest  girlfriend was 4'8'' tallest 6'4'', and prefer the short over the tall.
Not the dumpy😂😂😂
dont let em get to u beans we love u
isnt that ava michelle fron tall girl
That last girl is not beautiful LMAO
Wtf he was talking about his nipples at the end💀
Who else want to see the 12 year old next to beans?
1st to second girl was a big jump in height   Edit: in fact, the first girl would have to literally jump to reach second girls eyeline
It’s not the height it’s the fact he looks like a leprechaun
9:54 that gave me "no"-vibes
ur sponsor part of the video way to long. #annoying 5:23
Ni he isn't 5'3.....he is less than that
What a gem of a guy
10:53
10:54 lol
“yuhhh”
Let me guess #2 is here just to promote her OnlyFans?
Beans is very handsome no homo
So much respect for Sam and how polite and respectful he was! He made it fun for them and tried his best to be a good conversationalist.
How tall is that guy
Do they go on a date i want to know ?!! I’m rooting for them
im 5'9 and 12
So did him and the girl live happily ever after? WTF????
Finally good-looking contestants!
I am also a Short King 5'4 but I dont look anything like Beans.  His choice was very good btw.
9th
Now, wtf is that last mommy, I didn't know that was even possible 😂         (at least she can fill the mommy issues specially with those milkers)
Ngl it wasnt biologically smart for females to become this tall, that historically has no precedents (since in every race/region men have been taller) And we all know height matters, for many reasons, but in basic female's sexual attraction to men it plays a big role. That's been proven, whoever tells you "yOur pErsoNalItY MatTeRs tHe mOsT" is lying.  Now, I have to give it to this dude, life has been hard to me and I am 5'5, I could only imagine what a "few" inches less could do, and yet he seems sturdy, has not broken. That takes courage and real strength
Is the second girl a prostitute?
I’m 5’6 and I honestly don’t care if the girl is taller than me as long as they like me as much as I will like them
Bros as tall has me, a 13 year old 💀
Do they make a porn video in the end? Would be interesting to see.
BEAN BEAN BEAN BEAN BEAN BEANS
Im 5’11 1/2” (barefoot) I’ve been on a date with women who were 5’5” 5’8” and 5’9”. Regardless their look and personalities the one who matched the most with my height is definitely the 5’8” one without heels on meaning she was 5’8”barefoot..
Grace has the body, the look and the height that I prefer on a women, if she had the personality of Anita she’d be the perfect one for my perspective
we need more
"Which size would you like to try?" All of them
I LOVE Beans! He is the absolute best and so funny!
You guys are the best wing men.
100% made the right choice
The shortest girl I've dated was 5'2, and the tallest was 5'9. Average height is fine, and really tall or short girls are if they're reasonably attractive. I'm not picky. But there's something about girls on either side of average height that I find really attractive. 5'2-5'4, or 5'8-5'10. I can't explain why or if that's a common thing. I'm 5'11, higher end of average height, so technically an average girl in the 5'5-5'7 range should be ideal.
I’ve dated tall women before and I didn’t mind it tallest one so far was 6’10 and I’m 5’8
Beans is a gentleman
11:02 i need 2 look her up
11:27 Beautiful.
yuh
the first 2 irls r my height and the 3rd girl is 1 inch taller than me and i am 11
Yuu
You guys should try this with a tall guy and girls of different heights or a short girl with guys of different heights.
If you got $100K and a year for rehab, you can grow taller by 6 inches. There are surgical procedures that have made it possible. However, it's really stupid to pick men based on their height.
The last girl and I’m not trying to be rude at all but she kinda looks like the mom. From coralline
Beans name is SAM! WHATTTTTT
Y’all did beans wrong with this. Give him way better girls next time.
nobody: airrack:My friend just got jumped...And shopify also is like getting jumped because of how fast they ca setup a business!
Beans is now my idol
Beans wait i am coming i am 5'3
The 5'11" one was so conceited!
Let me get one that's 6,9 I wanna ride that ride ride ND see if I can conquer her Amazon body
5,9 looks small ND 5,3 looks tiny. I'm 5,9
What an idiot the first one was the best one
AINT NO WAY BEANS IS 5’3 N IM TALLER THAN HIM
Dude he’s freaking adorable
It’s so funny how hype airrack gets
5'9" girl should be embarassed
Me being 5,11 and 14 it is so funny
Yuh
i feel so bad for the first girl
I’m not gonna judge him for the first girl…personally I would never reject someone for being too short, however, the body proportions that result from dwarfism are not particularly attractive to me, and when you can only only chose 3 girls out of a lineup stuff like that starts to come into play. IRL though if a woman with dwarfism approached me and asked me on a date I probably wouldn’t say no assuming she didn’t come across as creepy, because I’m not the most conventionally attractive guy so I gotta take what I can get lol.
Kyra got me into hysterics😂
I'm 12 and 5"10 1/2
He shoulda gone with the other brown blazer girl, she pressed yes back. The curly hair girl was just being charismatic for the sake of it. Shame that he couldn't see that.... short kings need all the help they can get already
What happend to warolw 💀
okay at 2:48 this part kind of aggravates me when she says "I'd like it if someone who can toss me around".  Why? That's just the matter of physical fitness and not the size. I am 5'7 and i've been with women who are even up to 6 ft tall, who looked down at me from position of superiority. Luckily none of them was overweight and around 150s at most, while at my athletic prime I was around 160 with the body of body builder (was in US Army and always maxed out my PT tests and participated in athletic events when off duty like power lifting competitions and long distance running). - Despite me being shorter than 6ft females that I've been with I COULD OF EASILY PICKED THEM UP HEELS OR NOT AND DANGLED THEM IN THE AIR LIKE RAGDOLLS AND IT DID NOT MATTER HOW TALL WAS THEY OR ME! IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW PHYSICALLY CAPABLE I WAS! - This is just retarded "Oh you can't toss me around because you are short!" although it looked like D and D fantasy like scene of the non bearded dwarf in the bar brawl picking up and gorilla pressing local thug in the air.
Man just looking at this guy. He is definitely the king. If only there was some sort of magic or non-magical way to increase his height and he would be one of the top 10% attractive men in the world. This guy is just reeks of confidence and looks like he takes care of himself.
This legit makes me want a short king. 😍😍😍😍 I seriously want this man. Am 5'4" 😍😍😍
I’m a 5’9” woman and when I was dating, shorter guys often approached me wanting to date—some of them much shorter. It seemed like a lot of them liked taller women. I’ll be honest—being so tall, I felt awkward dating someone shorter, so I never did. However, now that I’m older (in my 40s), my priorities have changed. If I was single and dating again, I would be much less distracted by physical appearance and much more interested in positive personality traits like kindness. So to all the short guys out there, try going for an older woman because she might be more open-minded!
Women 😂😂😂
The tall girl at last was like I want airrack
The dwarf girl seemed really nice. I'd date her . . . and i'm 6'2"!
as a man that is not a 'short king,' I despise the term. Incredibly patronising.
I observed that the first 3 girls who were shorter than others had more respectful and pleasant attitudes.
The transition to the Shopify advert got me dead 😂
Being called short king is a massive insult.
SHOE AND CHEESE
Them shopify ads are everywhere on Airracks channels lmao
Beans is so cute honestly
roster full of baddies here
11:27 - 11:30 Oh the cringe and the fake laughter. A bunch of childish men.
1.) Should have picked the first girl. 2.) Should have picked the second girl. 3.) Then I stopped watching.
This will have to be the most staged interaction.. lol. who would come this far and tell him to ride by himself? i honestly love the middle girl at the end too bad she wasn't pick by the editors to be the winner
he¨s such an idiot, sorry for the girls
This makes this guy look under 5’0 honestly. I thought maybe he was shorter than me.. I’m 5’0. 😂 my husband is 5’3.
fifty years ago we had 'black is beautiful'; today we have 'short kings'
that guy is so confident it's inspiring.
What's real height of bean
Well we will never see her again
Whoever edited this is a legendary hero.
ahhh the last girl was literally the perfect fit for reasons.
Short King looks like a brown haired Daniel Radcliffe without the glasses.
The first girl is damn thick ! As a short emperor I'd take her out bro no cap.
''do i look like someone that can throw you around'' omg i died 😆
I'm also 5'3 😂
Beans is actually really attractive
I mean making the whole convo about if they’d be willing to date a shorter dude is weak game lol. Where’s the swag bra . Seems like a super nice guy though but if he had like a little edge he could actually prob crush it
Mans is minecraft steve sized full, my mans is full block mode,
The shortest girl has the biggest gyat.
What was that nipple talk at then end even about?? 🤨🤨
"I killed your family, they died slowly an painfully..." That one girl: *Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*
Dude gives off Daniel Radcliffe vibes
5'3".  She's probably 110 soaking wet.  He could definitely have tossed her around.
the aot 10:54 editing has me dead
It never began
Bro your measure system sucks, just use meters and centimeters pleeease
I think he wanted to reject the shortest girl to feel what it’s like because of height
The term short king is just icky
It's simple if she is hot you can't have her stop watching this video and accept you won't ever have a girlfriend
Whats anitas @
5' 11" sucks!
why does this video makes him look so much shorter? It must be the distance of the camera.
I used to often think and research about why women want to be like this, why women want to be like that, why women want to be treated this way, that way, and so on. Until finally I decided to stop studying the deepest ins and outs of women's psychology that I had studied for 4 years. Then I decided to try to fight without thinking about what other people thought about me.  It is important to remember and apply that any rejection, be it the woman you like, work, business, etc., will make you stronger and more resilient. Channeling your emotions through sports and creating work will be much more valuable than being confused, consuming drugs and/or alcohol.
Being tall isn’t even fun, I’d rather be born 5 foot 4 so I can play football better. I can’t dribble past loads of people cause of height swaying me
Is he 5’1 ?
Mara could be Shakira's twin.
haha wow that last woman, but btw I'm 5'6 and my son at 12 was taller than him too at 5'9 so it's not really unheard of
@1:06😍
The short king is THE MAN, a lot of confidence, a funny guy and a lot of charisma... not like the dumb guys in the control room, they're lack of all of that.
i think the host is DISINGENIOUS and Patronizing
7:53 How can anyone be so stupid.   A short guy won her over and then broke her heart.   That sucks, but if her reaction is to reject any man who happens to have something in common with that guy, she has truly become her own worst enemy.
This whole idea of a guy on a date (or whatever this is) and talking about height restrictions seems uber lame. I am 5'5" and I never discuss my height with a woman.  She can F***ing see how tall I am.   If she is shallow enough to reject me for being 5'5", what can I hope to accomplish by talking.
Those dudes are assholes . Not the short one
I'm 5'3 i dont think im short 😅
More people need to be like Beans tbh.
Short guys are great rebound fallback guys for broken damaged girls who are tired of being abused by tall guys.
Can someone share the title of the track at the end?
Once beans shook off the dust, the man was in his bag!
Ok now do Fat Girl Dates 10 men Thickest to Thinnest
im 12 and im 5,8
i dont like this guy in charge, hes not funny and just rude
I now understand and appreciate guys who have "little guy syndrome".
Yes beans and dam im taller then you
Can you guys be my WINGMAN?
chicks care so much about height cuz they're invested in how the world sees them and they glean social status from their men's social status (think of all the "you don't know who my husband is" hos) and they understand that short men are devalued by society; same thing applies to why they want men with prestigious careers. men on the otherhand will date down, sideways, up, it don't matter; we just want someone cool to be attracted to. also, all he talked about with these chicks is height. might as well not even bring em out. just a show a pic of all the ones who refuse to date shorter. i think the first chick was the best and the Yuh chick who agreed with being complimented (ugh YUCK) was by far far the absolute worst
I'm 5'11 now but used to be the shortest guy in both my schools, girls had zero interest in me. Even though I'm regular height now I still feel like a short guy and know exactly how Beans feels. It also made me very cynical about dating and attraction. I would equate being a short guy to a woman being overweight. Most people of the opposite sex are just going to write you off immediately.
I hate when you have to vote without meeting the next person because he could have said yes on the first three, unless they give you a chance to go back, which would be kind of bad if you have to take a yes away from a person you met ( which is good reality TV actually).
9:55 "you are beautiful" - "truuue"  BIGGEST RED FLAG
WTF...
2:28 No way
Yuuuuuhhhhhh yuhhhhhh 💀 so annoying
Se hubiera quedado a la más enana. La segunda estaba bien igual...
If i was him id be wearing af1 to benefit lmaoo
how does being short make you a king?
The 6'9 lady,how do L&D check their cervix ???? short fingers cant reach a long highway!!! bhahahahah.
What's really funny is that so many tall women believe their height is attractive and they therefore deserve a taller guy. I 6' tall and a woman nearing my height just feels really mannish, I'm not intimidated it just not feminine and attractive!
Never date a girl that acts like she is doing you a favorer to date you. Or in that one girls case, doing the group a favorer to to date one out of her preference.
Girls that are 5 11 want to date a NBA height guys ._.
Can I date Beans?
Height? No! OK! What about LENGTH?
King?
we are short kangzzzz
WHAT???? Really? Was the last woman more then 2 meters???? It was obviously she was used to shorter guys
Why did he have to choose the LEAST attractive one? The tall black woman on the right was BY FAR the most beautiful. Hands down.
This was fun to watch but seriously telling girls he loves them did he get tips on how to fail in speed dating
Can somebody please rell 5'3"s @ 😂
Yuhhhhhh
The first rejection was actual discrimination....
I feel like there should've been more variety in the 4'2" to 5'5" range.
Is there a follow up video
I honestly didnt even realize how many women who are tall care about it. I'm 5'9/10 and dated a guy who was 5'4 lol.
What a weird story.
"my left nipple is bigger than my right nipple" 😂
3:52 our dude was real beaming
the last one looks like the beldam from coraline.
My dad was 5'4" and no kind of classically handsome. Not bad, strong features, blue eyes, good hair, rugged build. He was seldom lacking for female company even as a single dad of four, because he was kind, funny, reliable and really liked women. Sam reminds me of him. A little better looking.
SamxLaura 4eva
if you guys ever do this again, let me know. I'd be willing to give this a shot; I'm 5'1"! haha. Great video - hoping things worked out for Beans and Kayla
He look shorter than 5'3 btw idk why ahaha
15:26 um excuAse me?
Really great format i really enjoy it.  However i would appreciate if there weren't so many wild jumpcuts with huge gaps inbetween. Also i don't understand the video glasses thing when you only show the vision for a split second.  I am sure you guys put a lot of effort into this video, why cut it so short?
SHORT: 4'2" dwarf girl: She's cute, but just a friend. 5'3" girl: Kinda trashy. Looks like a stripper.  MEDIUM: 5'5" Anita: Shallow AF. Hard pass for most self-respecting men. 5'6" Kayla: She's a keeper. ⭐ _She_ could be 6'9" and would still be a keeper. 5'8" girl: Shallow. Pass.  TALL: 5'9" Laura: Absolutely gorgeous, but too much baggage. 5'10" Marisela: Shallow and not even pretty, either.  LEGIT TALL: 5'11" Diana: Second prettiest one there, but stoned AF and a pretty awful person. 6'2" Kiera: Seems kinda normal, but definitely wants a 6'3"+ dude. 6'9" Ekaterina Lisina (baller, model, and YouTuber): I like her, but I know she wouldn't like me, and height has nothing to do with it.
The 6'2 black girl was cool . And of course the last woman was awesome
Beans!   You're a giant in my book man.  Cool dude!
may i point out he is very handsome, if he were like 6 all the girls would be drooling for him
BOSTON MENTIONED
He reminds me of BUD out of Married with Children 😂
I was waiting for him to get stomped on and throw across the room like a ragdoll 😂
I'd take the same on he took.  You can't go wrong with 5'8 model.  I think 5'6 to 5'8 is perfect.
HOW COULD YOU SAY NO TO EKATERINA!! 😦
I wish i could hug Ekaterina.. shes so sexy.. I follow her on Youtube. ❤
Stop calling short men short Kings, that's part of the problem right there, giving labels, who comes up with these terms ? S- media personalities ?
Pointless video from 3:00 onwards
Jaaaw “u beautiful” true Jaaaw
The co hosts are annoying.
I feel more at ease as a short king myself too.... You rock buddy
I knew it was kayla I knew it.!!!
Mogged  It's time to ropemaxx
what's the name of tallest woman? I think she's a YouTuber
I’m 6’2”,and I like the first girl.  She seems like the most vulnerable and traditional, but who really knows.
I'm 5'3 guy too. I never really see myself in a 3rd person perspective. Damn didn't realize how tiny i really look.
how tall is tyler?
This is sad and you are awful people
Height difference was a huge thing for me too. Im 5'7" or 5'6" and 2 of my x's where 2" to 3" taller than me. Settled on marrying 5'5" love of my life.
I'm 12 and 5'2, her son is 12 and taller than me, now I feel abnormally short.
these kind of videos shows how height effects the modern days
5'11 girl "yuh" girl needs to get yuhGAWKGAWKGAWK so she can properly speak
7:35 4-20pm and  69F LMFAO
3:25 she's bae, whats her @
That 5’11 girl wasn’t it
these videos suck
Now I love Laura.
why did they go from 4'2" for 5'3" they missed out on a huge proportion of women...just really odd...everyone above 5'2 is basically all the same
this guy is a professional content ripper.
Women can control their weight. Men cannot control their height.....Just sayin...
That edit at 10:50 Bro i died laughing it was so unexpected 🤣🤣
Bro.... first and foremost I just want to give a shoutout to the girl at 4:17. She is, gorgeous, yes..... but I just wanted to point out her scar at 4:15. She was on camera... but was willing to show a very straight horizontal cut on her wrist. Look, mental health is a complicated thing, and it can be confusing for anyone on the outside, as so much happens internally for the person going through it. But it's still an important topic. Life isn't about procreation, it isn't about survival. It's about 'living'. And all this meta thinking often comes with negative evaluations of life that can lead to depression or even self harm. I just wanted to point it out because maybe even she didn't think much of it. And hey, it could have been a cut from something that wasn't self harm. But in case it is, I just wanted to remark on it to let the spirit of her (those like her) know that she is not alone.
he chose wisely :) The girl with shortest skirt :D Joking, actually he has choosen girl he could actually date, practically, and also someone who is, objectivly, one of two msot beautiful girls here (second one is the one in the middle of those 3 from the end). I truly beleive he could make something happen with the girl he has chosen, as their height is similar (for some reason height is extremely important to girls). I hope they have good future
These hoes ain’t nun, before they accept a real man they gotta care bout height and shit
You should have screened the women so that he could not see them.
There are definitely really great women who don't care about height at all. I had a friend from Latin America who was 5'5 and every woman loved this guy.  He had a gf who was way over 6 feet who very pretty and extremely confident with herself. It was so fun hanging out with them as the vibes were so positive.  I am around 5'10.5 and had an ex I was taller than, but she would wear 4 inch heels and be just about the same height as me. She kept saying how short I was and how she wished I was over 6 feet. Height aspirations never crossed my mind as both my parents are 5 feet tall, but they made sure we ate a lot and did a lot of sports. My brother is over 6 feet tall. My wife now close to my height now without heels and I'm so glad we got married. She doesn't care about a lot of trivial stuff.  It's all in one's perspectives.
"Nasty, brutish and short."
Im not surprised that in the end the black chick was the rudest 😖
Broooo, I wanted Beans to pick anita she was so pretty and nice 😢❤ but still, I respected his decision😊
This man beans can dance in front of a 3000 audience with his shirt off and sing rick astley but when it's comes to women this man fumbles😂
I genuinely hope he dates Kayla now.
ATT...MEN...  IT S US  , NOT  YOU....    GIRLS WANT TO FEEL SMALL & CUTE.... NOT LIKE BIGGER THAN A GUY  BCUZ  SADLY i't s been instilled in us smaller the prettier....
Beans and Laura need a podcast where they interview people.
This is above my cringe threshold
I come from a very short statured family on Mom's side. My uncle was only 5'6" and his first wife was 5'11" model. The next 2 weren't much shorter.
Jumping from 4'2 to 5'3 was a big jump. I wanted to see someone around my height (5'0) but I feel left out, lol
*Yuh*
I would smash all of them. Even beans.
9:11 I like that one, she's funny. Sassy funny, but although she's making fun of him, she didn't wear heels, so she's actually nice.
yuuuuuhh
What's the outro music?
Kayla really was the best choice. Hope she did not act for the show and they actually date.
im 5'1 💀
Since when is "Conservative" a compliment.  Last I checked it was synonymous with being a traitor.
Dude is a total simp 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
yuuuuuuuuuhhh
So excited to see Eketarina here. She's my semi-celeb crush.
Ekatarina is truly special, she's both stunning beautifull and has a delightfull personality !  Granted such height difference  between them would make things complicated, but they had some chemistry indeed !  It amazes me that I'm considered tall being 6 2 or 1,87 m  and yet she is a solid 20 cms / 7 inches taller than :O !
From this short video it does indeed seem Kayla is the most likeable. Hard to tell because these things are edited but I like her vibe.
13:10 XD
He's not single because of his height... "I have a hemmoroid"... Really bro. HAS to be staged.
Aubrey needs to take the lip injections out, but God damnit I'd toss her around
Maura is literally shakira
No way he 5'3. dude look 5'0 at best wtf
Kayla was the best of them
Didn't know Jim from The office has this Youtube channel! So that's what he do now after the tv show ended!
6'9" girl hot af
MAHAI CURNITEEEEEE NIEGRI
girl wearing green was being weird af at 10:40, wtf why she even there gtfo
4 seconds in, already being disrespectful to him, refusing to call him his name? Shame on you, disliked, learn better behaviour!
The last woman its outstanding. Beautiful.
The ride things makes no sense because if you're short you're less likely to fall off the ride and more secure in it if you're tall and gangly you're going to sway a lot likely fall or get injured more often. The height regulations of how these rides are built are also not built for someone tall so the chance of injury is higher for taller people. Yes the height thing is very outdated.
Yuh
he kinda looks like Daniel Radcliffe ngl
Laura is so fucking cool. I would have chose her.
2:03 - Damn. He made that woman cry. A woman her height probably encounters a lot of challenges and she might have gone into this expecting someone sensitive of those challenges.
I'm willing to bet most of these girls are not the height they said they were. the 5'5 chick is really 5'3, the 5'8 chicks are 5'6 and a half on a good day, and beans is more like 5'2.
YUHH
Who is Miss e katrina
Damn, all these women are cruel.  I would never volunteer to be on this show.  Women are the most evil coonts on the planet.  If the reverse happened, then it would be a hate crime.
So did beans and kayla start dating?
Last indian song❤
As a kid, I always asked myself why the world goes to crap when we are all so intelligent once we grow up. Now, just watch this video.
how i she 6,9?! I saw female twins with 6,8 in the guiness world record book for their height. I would say this height only get like 1 in a million woman
I really dont undestand american units of value and the high system with foot and inches... WHY IS A INCH 2,54 cm????
holy man im like 6,2 foot 3:20
ive never seen a girl over 6,2 f (im 6,2 foot with 16years)
anyone else notice the 5th woman missing? 0:07
why does anita look like olivia rodrigo?
Man the last one was beautiful. I think she would of been down with him
Daniel Radcliffe vibes... which is actually cool...
ERIC. WHY DO UR ARMS LOOK SO WHITE IN THE VIDEO?🤣🤣💀
Humans are such diverse beings…you got ppl the size of dogs and the size of dinosaurs
Is it just me or did anyone else think for a second that the host was Jim from The Office ?
This is so funny because I’m 5’2” and the 5’3” girl looked so tiny but I still feel like I’m taller than her 😂
iam gay man and i cant get with a short king i like them but they endup being very sasy and rude
i need this in spanish, pleaseeee
We’re all the same height lying down.
97% of women ask for a taller man, usually at least 4 inch taller than them.
I put filters on 5'10 to 6'2 but its all about personality and who you really are as a person
Tyrion Lannister dates up to Brienne
This video just showed you today how shallow women can be. Don't believe what they say, look at their action. Even if he was willing to give taller women a chance, none of them wanted him.
the video became funny with yuh yuh yuh 😂
I’m 5’4 but why does he look so tiny on camera to me lol is it his outfit??
This video is making people as commodities!
LOL.  I would have picked her too.  She is laugh-and-a-half.  I would have also chosen the other one of similar height.  The different choice would have been that sk4nky one in the red (number 2).  She and I would have picked each other based on what I always get with --- a bad romance, but the ride would be fun.  AHAHHAHAH....
Beans looks like Daniel Radcliffe had a baby with Post Malone
“My dog died today”  Y u h
what's the track right at the end anyone know?
beans is the best
Promo*SM
tall woman "i care about heigh"... hee... good luck.
These women, are not that much taller than each other...from begining to end, and 10 women, it's basically the same height. The shortest is basically the average height, and the tallest is WAY over average. Just seems your making fun of height.   Yall women don't want short men. We want a man that's bigger than us, just the same as a short women, wants one taller than her.  Sorry if a 6' woman doesn't want a 5' whatever man. Most men don't want a woman that's bigger than him, same suite.  Get over making fun of your friend. Men usually are shorter than the dream woman they can obtain, so they find a women who is closer in their size, and go from their.  Size matters... In many ways.... 👻💫😏  Men want smaller women.... And women want to be smaller... So if we are 3 ft or 6ft, we still want to feel smaller...
Ik what these guys do
From my experience (tall girl) short guys love tall girls and tall guys love short girls 😂😂 makes no sense
I'm almost a girl almost 6'3 and my ex husband  is 5'3...it's interesting....( our kids topped at 5'4) I always got rejected for being too tall, so height isn't on my requirements...but, he kept hinting he wanted a shorter girl...it hurt... My hubby is 5'8 and calls me his monster girl 😊❤
The man is brave ,I can't a taller girl
I can't get with this YouTube channel because the way y'all edited that black girl comes across racist, there I said it. Do better. No one else got edited like that, but as soon as the black girl comes she's like this huge giant or something and there was someone that was taller than her and y'all ain't edit her like that, in fact you said that she was your dear friend. Do better. Definitely calling y'all out for that
I would date Beans, for sure. I’m 4 foot 10 and I think he ticks the boxes. I’m in the UK, though. But if he wants to come over for a holiday…😉
These ugly white dudes behingf the cam are super racist the most tall white female didnt get a rude giant edit but the 2nd to last woman did, then thier rude expressions.
The 5' 11" "yuh" girl is for sure a deadhead.
Not gonna lie I find it kinda hilarious that this dude rejects a girl because she is too short, yet I am here at 6'8" and never gave a shit about height 😂
2:10 @ ?
I guess I like extremes, because 4'2 and 6'9 would be my top 2 picks! #3 would be 'partner in crime' girl, or the one who wants to be tossed around.
the 5 foot 11 girl is one stupid girl
I would have taken all of them except the "yuh; true; yuh" girl & the one who wouldn't stfu about her short ex. I'd pick no personality over obsessed with her ex though.
Beans carried this whole show on his back coz  the hosts definitely didnt
yuuuh
wow all the girls are so pretty !
The girl that had green shirt and cowboy boots her yeahhhhh yeaaehh
is he stupid? He short that short girl looks pretty good even for normal height standards and he rejecting her for her height? Holy shit. .
Beans is so cool  I love this man !
lara (no offense at all she seems really sweet) is like the worst kind of person to invite to a show like this but at the same time it's a relief because she was easy to reject  wait i think diana is worse
Kinda rude making a scene basically calling a women big foot.
The 6'2 girl looks like Chris from "Everybody hates Chris"
He’s not 5”3 lol
I just turned 12 and I’m 5 foot nine and a half
The second woman looks like (no Offense ) Katja Krasavice
He's actually a chad
I think EVERYONE would chose Tayla!
I hope he marries 4:35 lady, I can't watch this any further, it's. This makes me feel very uncomfortable, I'm 5"5' and had an absolute horror dating for 10 years and Beans is such a gentlemen sweet guy and I'm a rotten, bitter jaded selfish idiot. Beans deserves happiness! If he doesn't find it in 6 months we start a petition!
2 minutes in, Beans is such a sweet guy with a killer nick name. It breaks my heart that he had to "reject" the first girl who was nice. this whole rejecting somebody else, I'm just a p*ssy I guess, it's kinda heart breaking.
I hate the comment section, he is kind of like a jerk but whatever
nobody: a 5'11 girl: yeuhhh
How tall is the short guy ?
We need an update.
That kayla girl is amazing
definitely did the black girl dirty in editing.. typical 🙄
why are literally 7 of them tall ??
what did he say at 5:42 ? I can't understand what he says.
beans is my favorite out of the crew. more than airrack hehe
When that girls was like, "I'm a model and work at a coffee shop," what she really meant was, "I work at a coffee shop."
Bro got his Oscar 💀💀💀
Man bean is so humble
The excuses women make. Unbearable. lol
How tall is beans
Beans is an inch taller than me and I’m 12
0:07 -30°C~45°C 0:53 -33°C 2:28 -1°C 3:12 4°C 4:11 12°C 6:39 13°C 7:05 14°C 8:49 17°C 9:45 20°C 11:04 27°C
I happen to be 6’2”, my husband… 5’10”
Yo Airrack where did you get that shirt from I really want to get one
Since you brung up that giantess meme, there’s actually valuable things that small guys could offer to big girls
Short kings rizz is sky high
The 5'5 girl tho man im 5'10 but con is im 13 so i cant date
6’9 “5 inches isn’t a lot” All men 😢
I don’t think Ekaterina Lisina is single
When he said,”you know what’s not hard” I thought he was talking about something else 😏
He’s just short
After watching this I got a gf so Ty arrack
Watching 5,1" me😢😢
All 10 of them are so beautiful, it really is a shame how much women care about height
I don't want to be seen next to someone like you. Damn, that broke my soul, I feel for the guy.
Ms. Green shirt sounds drunk
6:47 what is the point of going on this show then
My make or break question to any of these girls would be: Are you willing to give me piggyback rides on a regular basis?
Aww the first girl was só cute
The 5’3 girl would be surprised to know that I can indeed “toss around” my 5’4 gf at 5’1 🫡
Metric. I miss metric.
bruh beans got a fantastic personality fr
a short Afro-descendant black girl and a tall,beautiful white woman 😈😉🙎🏿‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️
13:49 huh , the handshake...I think the last lady's arm, is actually taller than him in his entirety.
not the girl that went yuh 💀 i kept on crying lmao
I don't like the 5 11 girl she keep saying yaaa it just so rude I don't like her
"You see where your eye level is? At my boobs." Kinda unfair to say that. It's a condition a lot of us men have and has nothing to do with height.
It’s been three weeks and we still haven’t gotten told if beans, and Kayla are dating
who is that @girl at 3:12 !? she's my type😀
5.11 was a junkie
5' 11'' girl was lowkey (highkey) rude af
The one in the green dress was so toxic 😂😂😂
The black woman was savage with her attitude, nothing new I guess......
Its funny watching you guys call 5,9 girls tall😂 me as a dutch guy just cant understand that. We got the tallest average height in the  world 6for boys and 5.9 orso for women
He rejected the first woman based on her height, I think it's unfair.
Okay next time get some tall chicks who actually like short men on there. 📞
My wife is 5'0 and i am 6'0. Why couldnt you find any normal girls at that height, there a shit-ton of them. Why jump to 5'3, thats not even that short for a girl.
I SHOULDVE BEEN THERE. ME. ME. ME! WTH?!!??!!?? IT SHOULDVE BEEN ME. I WOULD LOVE A SHORT KING AAGHHHHH T ____ T
All the women are gorgeous!! And Bean is so so nice
7:26 what nonsense .. she by definition stated she don't trust short guys while being on a show MENT to date a short guy ....
Yaaaaaaaaawh
lol look at the girl who came second 15:35 0 consolation
Huh he only dates 4'11 and up this start is amazing lol!
Nice video
oh my gosh how can a person be this adorable and handsome at the same timeeee
As a guy, who is just average or technically a inch above average... I don't think I could marry a tall girl. Reasoning is health issues, taller people have much worse cardio health. I would want to think of our offspring. More oxygen and calorie requirements, overall worse health and most tall people are very uhhh awkward looking. They all remind of that green clay guy Gumby?
On 10:58 I don't care what anyone says cause I think she's a GIANT and she can crush me or eat me anyday 👑👣🛐❤️
The first girl no.1 was cute I’d definitely do her. No. 2 Was 5ft 3 inches nothing wrong with her sexy yes I’d definitely do her. Nice eyes. No.3 not my type no.4 ok but mmm no.5 nice no.6 sexy but playing up to camera. Religious.. no thanks. no.7 nice arse. Pity about the tattoos. No. 8.  Jerk. No.9 ok no.10 ok. I picked the winner…. I’d go for no.2 but she’d have to lose the attitude, then I’d make sure she knew my SIZE!!! 😂if you get my drift!!!!!
oh god i really like the green shirt girl
Such a nice guy
Girls are always talking about how unrealistic girls body standards are but they have no problem projecting their fantasies onto guys. Like girls average guy height is 5'9, stop saying anyone under like 6'1 is short💀👍
Aww Anita looked really sad at the end I think he should of chose Anita she has a great personality and was really pretty❤
Let's get real, how many of us have lost money using shopify lol.
What really peeves me about being a short guy is how girls talk down to us. It’s incredibly demotivating in the dating world to be talked to like you are a kid all the time
First yes = Olivia Rodriguo
Im 6”5 and even she is too tall for me 🤣💀🤣 leggo 🚀
He’s not a short king he’s a short emperor
yuh
Soooooo does anyone know the song playing in the outro??? It's driving my gf nuts and we don't know how to look it up without a name or band.
Lol Awkward all the way through.  King of Confidence there. I love it.  They were all good sports.
I like how his hair adds 3 inches to his height.
I love black women they are good.
My height is 6'3.6" (192cm) without shoes. I am 19 years old and I am from Russia.  Although I haven't measured my height for a long time, I am very tall compared to the average resident of Russia. When I walk around Moscow, I am a giant. I love the one that is black 6'2" she is beautiful, but those that are nearby are also good.  I hope to leave for the USA in 2027.
Wtf is harry potter doing there💀
I love how they tried to respectfully knock the 5’11” chick down a peg 😂
Remember, the rest of the world uses metric. We dont understand imp.
7:47 If I was in his place I would have pressed "no" a long time ago. How are you going to generalize like that? That's so immature...
2:40 Yes, I can toss you.....out the window that is, crazy broad..
5’3 girl is like 4”11 being honest
Let me, a 5'8'' lesbian, date women on a hight spectrum. Plz.
Short heighten man name pls tell me
That fist girl was a baddie with a fattie.
I’m from Weymouth Massachusetts
Can he stare at Breasts all day
girl with the green dress was obnoxious 😭
I'd think that very tall women would actually be more generous,  since by default they are taller than most people in general.
wow !
Really good making
5'3 european american, super rare, it's good to see other shortcels out in the wild.
Yo why do girl ask you about your height when we can't ask them about their weight
i will never understand why someone cares about the height of their partner
painfull to watch
Cringe fest
Tell Beans to hit me up. His kindness is sexy. 🥰
How short of a woman would be considered to be too short for a guy that is 6’3” or taller? I know that I am short at a bit over 5’. My height has never bothered me and to be honest I don’t even think about it. However, when I meet people that feel the need to tell me that I’m short as if they’re revealing this to me for the very first time, I do enjoy messing with them by responding with a serious look and tone and stating “I’m not short, I’m just vertically challenged and I’m okay with it.” Then I can’t help but laugh. One of my best friends refers to me as being “Fun Size”… there’s “Fun Size Candy and there’s Fun Size Mandy - a little goes a long way”!
Bro my mom4 foot 11
tall women are more heightcists than skinheads are racists. Got it!
marisella pullin ari grande the whole date
Why reject the little lady?
Who was the first chick? Asking for a friend
I'm 4 foot 4
Bro looks like the guy from the scooby doo movie who was dating Velma
I'm 6'5 and I got rejected for being tall🤷🏾‍♂️. So everyone has a type.
12:12 hobbit steping on Queens foot :D
It really sucks being a short guy!!! Women really really do care about how tall a man it and it sucks!!!!!
He seems like a really cool dude and a well spoken gentleman. Not short if he come to asia. Most of my girl friends are shorter than him. I'm about his height as well
Beans looks like George Michael
They even have the same type of laugh!
How tall is he?
Why did you all edit the black girl like that? That's weird. No one else was edited like that. She was having the same kind of conversation all the other women were with him and you called it boring. Do better.
AND DID THEY DATE
I love short men
Yuhh
He’s a much better men than the two hosts.
What a great guy he is!!
Death by snu snu?
yuuuuhhh
Comment section seems to be full of bitter men who have this whole mindset of " but I am tall!! Why are women not throwing themselves at me and are showing genuine interest in this SHORT man (who happens to be a perfectly pleasant  and likeable fella)  ". which goes to show the amount of delusion and entitlement they have. Have you considered not being a talentless mediocre douchebag?
Lol short king does that make me a tall god ? 😂😂
I would deff have chosen the shortest and the tallest for life experience adding purposes 😂
Beans is awesome af
They all look really good
The taller they are she gonna need to pick me up to kiss her 😂 like a little baby 😂
I would date that 4'2 lady since she seems so calm.
Dude reminds me of a really funny lil shia labeouff
Did he get shorter
Black woman is sooo cringe
How did he pass up that 1st girl though? She cool, cute, and thiccc
I can toss number 2 around all day
At least #6 picked up an irrelivant prejudice associated with her ex that was NOT HIS ASTROLOGY SIGNS.  7:10 When dates start evaluating who I am based on my birthday being in the same season as their ex...  I stop caring what their opinion will be of me before they even announce if we're compatible or not.  Fun fact to share on your first dates:  Constellations aren't actually real!   It's up to anybody's imagination how you play connect-the-dots in your view of the sky.  You could just as well draw a big dick constellation between the stars.   (and yes I know this is totally what a Scorpion would say)
Last night I had my first bad dream in which I was measured and it turned out I was ONLY 5'9"  I think I've been reading too many Tinder bios.  and I'm even a taller than average guy.  Stay strong my short brothers ✊🏼
outro music?
BRO HE WAS OK HIS HIGHT IS NICE BUT AGAINST THAT LAST GIRL BRO A MIDGET
Kind of wish you guys had more shorties.  There was like, one who was shorter than him.
He is so annoying the one that is talking about Shopify or something 😂
5’9 girl is a big red flag
we need a follow up
they've done him dirty rip beans
5’3
I called it yay
This video may be comical in nature but it does reaffirm without effort that most women have no use whatsoever for a short man.  These ladies were just being polite.  Short guys have to learn to grow thick skin from puberty and expect to get rejected a whole lot more than the average tall guy.  You have to shoot your shot way more often than a tall guy who has women fawning over him immediately, just because of his height.  You got to move on to the next woman and forget the last one, more than tall guys do.  Plenty of women of all shapes and sizes don't care about height though.  The best advice given to me is to keep your eyes open for them.  I adore the tall ones who don't have anything holding them back from looking down and taking on a shorter guy.  They are rare but well worth the experience, if you're into that.  The pleasure is amazing simply because there is more of her to love.
Short king? Mf rejected a women for being too short! Can’t be a king AND a hater
I'm his height, I would have choosed the same winner, but I would have sayed yes to last woman and no to the penultimate.
That 5'11 girl in green on crack or something? "yuh"
Ekaterina is single 👀
Who was that 6'9 girl like love her accent
The insecure short guy, rejecting based on height. Needs a therapist.
I feel so bad for him… he seems like a super chill dude. I’m 6’3… at least I only have to worry about being ugly.
Harry Potter doing well i see.
As a sbort dude I hate that short king bs, I am not a king because I am short. I am a king that happens to be short.
Good luck to Beans, maybe he'll find someone tall and have tall kids?
“Beans” looks like a mini-me version of CT from MTV Road Rules
This video was clearly comical and can’t be taken seriously but we all know that women will never like you as a short person  It sucks and it is very demoralizing to be judged for something we can’t control …almost to the point where we feel like useless offspring
I am 5’8 and my wife is 6 ft and I enjoy climbing to kiss her.  I would if had the chance to pic taken the shortest girl. Absolutely beautiful girl.
im 5'8 and she made us 5'8 girlies seem so short but everyone around me makes me feel like im a gaint so this really put some things in perspective for me lol
Damn i would love a boyfriend like him! Even if i am lesbian!
How tall is he?
You guys, you people!! 😂
5’3 girl would never go with him.
You can say what you want about midgets but their booty!!! 😂
yuhh
Dating or hooking up with one Girl is a waste of effort. finding an Honest Woman who wouldn't cheat on you is not possible. If you need a girl just pay for the sex and there will never be any Drama in your life,
Jesus never told stories, he told parabolas for those who knew him
am i the only one but i see his aura
He fumbled the foreign at the end
Lmao he's adorable and hilarious.
Now if it was reversed, you would likely find that the guy would be far more tolerant of the height difference than women. Guys are cooler in this.
2nd one is the best
too many imports
Anita genuinely looked disappointed he didn’t swing her way, both her and Kayla had great personalities, I’m just surprised he only asked one question at the end
It’s over 😬
Beans is like the guy in an all girls group that’s reacting the most shocked to the latest gossip
You should do an episode about BREAST SIZE!  And watch the tears as men give women a taste of their own medicine!
I sure can really relate on what it feels like to become a short little man i am 61 years old i have dealt with all kinds of things especially meeting women no matter what Now! I will be really honest about it is when you meet someone who is taller than what you are that really can become a problem to some women because they would rather prefer someone they own size rather than to be with someone just like my size and more which i have dealt with this issue a hole lot of times especially when you either meet women who is honest with you or who is not so honest with you all about it. But! I really do believe there is something just your size not only who can relate to what you think and not only that But! what you react you see what i am saying? I am 4 foot 3 or four foot five that has dealt with this ever since i was a child and when it all comes down to Rejection believe you me i sure have been there and done that. I sure would Love to really be a Special Guess right on this show so I can tell My Story Well this was Fun watching because it sure does really truly remind me of Myself and what i have gone threw in life just by meet women in Jesus Name this is The Evangelist Drummerman David Lee Penn saying Thank You Very Much and May God Bless You
he got a really great sense of humor😄
That was sad to watch.
Imagine being 5 3 and not being disabled to go with it
The 6'9" woman had normal proportions, she should be in the wnba or olympics or something.
JUST - GO - MONK. They are ALL the same. Don't even bother with w*men if you want to be happy.
hey wait i wanted to hear him talk more about his nipples at the end
Why does the microphone guy look like a hotter version of Jim for the office .
Song at the end?
the 5'5 girl is beautiful to be honest lol
I love the giantess effect lol
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What was that edit at 10:54 lmaoooooooo
My brother is  610 he’s 15
as dr.seuss would say 5’3 thats taller then meee
I really am sam. didnt ask sam:😢
why was 5’11 girl trippin
11:26 WHY DID ERIC MAKE THAT SOUND DUDE LMAOO
The 5'9" hottie in red should seek therapy. The 5"11 Cowgirl in green should lay off the 420. "Yuh"
what is the name of the song in the end of video?
Not that one girl just saying "Yuh" 😂 I need to see more of her that shi was funny af
wtf was beans talikg about at the end
Girl in the green was as high as a kite… lmfao
Short women are the best women.
Wish my friends would make me go on a speed date with 10 girls with different hights.
IF SHE SAYS YUH AGAINNNN!!!
My mom is 51
The tallest thing about this guy is his confidence. I wanna be like you.
I didn’t expect beans to be talking about nipples at the end
i just wonder why more than half the girls were tall, i think it would’ve been fairer to have a few more girls that were shorter or the same height as him!
Yo arrick i want to be in you vids
I bet if he told them how much money his parents have they would all say yes.
My be the best video on YouTube right now. I’m in….subbed
I'd toss her around...
Any one else think he could be daniel radclifs brorher lol
Airrack is the best wingman here
THE ANIMATIONSS XD
My ex was a stunningly beautiful woman, who was nearly 6ft and several inches taller than me.  I definitely enjoyed a lot of aspects to being with a woman like that but one of the downsides is constantly having to fend off other dudes.  She would get many comments from other guys saying things like, "why are you with him", " isn't he way shorter than you?", Not to mention the downright obvious up and down stares of her when we went anywhere in public as though I wasn't even there.  Eventually I just came to a place where I didn't let it bother me.
What happened between bean and that girl?
Hey Airrack, I want to let you know that you look like my Camp Counselor from when I was in the 7th grade. I just felt the need to let this off my chest. Thank you for you consideration
I'm only 5'7 with a 7 inch cock.
Bruh where’d all the old videos go
Even the midgets wants a 6ft+ man.  Dating is brutal if you're a short dude.
why tf are you gonna go on something like this if youre not even over your ex
He is so sweet! I like that he is confident and honest with his choices and that most of the girls (most of...) were nice and also honnest. Great content!
Airrack is a total jerk giving the only girl shorter than him a girl that is one with dwarfism. 😢 Might as well threw one in with no legs at that point.  Couldn't do 4ft 6,7,8,9,10,11. 5ft 1,2.
I’m 4’11 so if you can’t ride I for sure can’t ride😂 that was funny lol
Laura and Bean unironically have a best friend dynamic.
Yuh
That edit with lady #9 is crazy 😂😂😅
10:55 funniest shi... fr
Giant ❤️ in a small package 😅
I maybe 5’5 but I can 6’9
americans are so fake...
❤️
Beans looks like Daniel Radcliffe.
Pls do a 100 dates with me 🥵
I get a lot of ''hostility'' and ''jealousy'' from other women, mostly because I get a lot of attention from men, even if only a few are ''brave'' enough to approach me, despite the fact that I am 6ft1. And I find it so ironic and unfair given the fact that most guys even the taller ones prefer shorter and average-height girls. They see me like a fantasy, an exotic experiment or whatever but not like a potential girlfriend. But still some women feel very threatened by me, so I feel lonely at times 😅
In this day and age if you have a taller woman who's not just sucking you off cuz you got money, you're the man.
Laughter is the best height booster! 🤣📏 Whether you're short or tall, confidence and a positive attitude are what truly makes a person stand out. Kudos to these conversations for reminding us that it's the connections we make that matter most. 👫✨
This why your gonna be single forever beans i would dated tht 4,2 chick she had a cake to give and this man over reaching woth alot of these girls
17:18  Some other guy in the room whobthinks he's short: "You guys? You guys?! What do you mean you guys?!  Me who's 5'4": You're not able to say that, you're just 5'6" and slouching.
The 5’11 girl? Wtf😭 So pretty but the attitude was just gross
it’s crazy how Eric turns anything into 4:54  Pizza
Who was the 4,2 girl? Im just asking for research purposes
Social media of the 6’9 lady?
I think 5’11  might’ve been high
This short king looks like WAROWL
Guys I need cm I'm confused.
Beans and 5'3 girl its a match
Some of the ladies were a bit disrespectful and gave him no chance at all.
Bro always seems to slip in the shopify add
The little woman was taller then him sitting down
Genetics are the most important thing when finding a partner. Height is less important to me than their ethnic make up. Almost every woman in this has black hair, often dyed lighter. I want my children to look like my family, not like someone elses family. I am 6', and have dated between 5'10" and 6'2" (girls here apparently are just tall if you select for your own ethnic group) and have never had a problem with dating women taller than me. However there is a lower limit, I won't date a short girl unless her father is like 6'6" or above. For the same reason; I want my children to look like my family, not someone elses family.
Olivia Rodrigo
He and the 5'9 are like really really good friends lol
i need to say that the girl that won is propably the sluttiest woman from all of them, just by look ofc
what we learned (that everyone knew) was that the more normal girl and conservative is, the better for chemistry between men and woman :)
Kayla is gorgeous,damn
Jaaaaahhhhuuu
whats the name of outro song?
The short man should become an actor. He’s pretty good when it comes to communication and being enthusiastic.
Im taller than almost all of those girls
This was brutal to watch, it never even began for him.
tf they do to coffeezilla
I didn’t think I was that short until the second girl was my height
I would have picked the same girls and I’m tall
Being confident and funny adds inches to your height. I'm 5'6". My wife didn't realize how short I was until our first dog died.
They're actually a great match and I can feel their positive energy together! Happy for both of them!
5'7-5'10 is the magic range for women with great personalities.  EDIT: Guarantee you don't need "more" confidence for taller girls because theyve accepted being taller than a lot of men.
the girl saying "yuh" has me dying 💀
4’2 to 5’3 is a bit of a jump It would’ve been good if they could’ve found someone else shorter than him. Considering the rest incrementally get taller by ‘2-‘3.
Anotalatusm back down it’s avaeez nam sayn? With a” woo woo Woo Woo” anotalaseez fuh is you takin bout Fr nam sayn?
Yes i'm 18 and 5'5" man
Man, why do girls give a damn? Literally shouldn't matter. I've dated all kinds of heights short and tall. All can be assholes 😂
That 5’11” girl>>>>>>>
5'3"? I met a guy 4'7" yesterday who was the shortest adult I've seen (of a normal physique). 80 lbs maybe? Be interesting if that was tall for our species.
Until now i have shit mood after i see this video iam happy again 😄
The fact that the guy doesnt care bout high whilr girlscare crazyyyyy like whays the deal with high
2nd: I'm from Califor....... Me: Rejected.
How tall is beans
Most women are 🚮🤦
im 5ft3 guy and the struggle to get a girl is real - no one likes us shorty guys
Chick in green shirt was mad confusin.....something is wrong with her yaahhhh. The two gurls before and after her tho would def get the yes along with the first 2 he liked of course
WE WANNA SEE HIM MORE OFTEN!!!!
I like tall women, bud tall women do not like me
LMAO
This was boring, the guy is gross. All those women deserve so much better than him
yuh girl is literally an npc lol
Beans is a cool name
Tell what u whant but even he is small he has big feet ,and u knoe what they say for guys with big feet !
Why they do Kyra like that? lol omg
Brilliantly edited. Subscribed
wtf is wrong with him, bro the hemoroid
Now do the one short guy with a big wallet. How will these 10 women react to it?
some? SOME?
I want an update on if beans went out with the girl! Even just a yes
Yuhhhhh
The first girl is the one for him😂.
preference is ok
Thank you Beans for calling them out on their weird rudeness with the 6'2 girl (also unnecessary edit when she wasn't even the tallest)
The first girl looks like Sydney Sweeney
Madi is caked up
If I were him I’d say yes to the first girl. Him saying no felt like watching a 300lb woman say she wouldn’t date a fat guy.
The fact that he rejected the 4’2” girl is crazy. If you’re 5’3” you don’t get to reject short girls.
YUH
I just realized after watching AOT that airrack's utro is in fact  From Aot
Plenty of girls are in the 4'10" to 5'2" range. Where they at?
I mean he still picked the most attractive one.
green shirt girl just went yeaaaaa all the time lmao
Let’s go beens
Dayana es mi tipo no habla mucho xd
Why did it got deleted the 1st time
hard watch
shortest to tallest? 😂                     I   I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
He's a good looking dude. Handsome. And he has great potential.  But i am going to be honest and very harsh in my statements.  They have zero respect for his presence. And it doesnt help that he's basically simping and handing over his balls to them by allowing them to make the decision for him. He's pedastalizing them way too much and complimenting them. They do not want to be accepted by him. He's misinterpreting there "niceness" as them genuinely wanting to be with him.  He's also sacrificing his own self respect to impress them by hope.  He messed up already by devaluing himself by the 1:38 mark.  Or actually, he messed up just by participating in this event to begin with.  But then again, what did you expect. This was probably his only chance at getting something going for himself.
How is it called the music in the end of the video?
That 5'11 girl needs to be humbled
AS a 6’5 guy at 14 i thought I was gonna be the tallest guy I am 6’6 and 24 now 😅
The way he just through that Shopify ad in there
The end tho
@cody
Sam sam sam sam sam sam sam
whats the song at the end?
Both hosts are kinda douchebags. They keep saying "he's so nervous" when he's clearly not. Then they pulled the "ehhhhhh" on him
''so ima go my mom just died'' ''yuhhh''
Yuhhhhh 😂
It's rough for short kings
If the girl is honest, she will say that height matters and he presses no. What's the point of this?
Beans looks like the American version of Daniel Radcliffe.
I'm 5,7" and I would totally go on a date with Beans. He seems like a gentleman.
Yuhhhhhh
you got the thimbnail wrong, there are more than 5 women
The sixth one is very Attractive her voice her laugh her preference
I am using a stepladder anytime I date a woman...😂  Women and girls here are the advantages to get engaged with ( me...ehm...) a short man:  1. We are cheaper. We eat less than big men  2. You can impress your grandmother with us:  Just tell her that you adopted a teenager.  3. You can go enywhere and get discounts:  Just say your man is your child 😂   4. Short men are more flexible on bed.🎉🎉🎉🎉 I let you imagine...😂😂😂  5. Your man is a treasure: He will be yours, not many women are " ready" to see his value  6. Short men make police officers more kind..  So, don't worry to much to get fine...😂😂😂😂  Now,  after these free suggestions...hold your phone and call me, darling 😂
This reminds me of something my friend and I came up with. He is 4 11 and if someone was bein weird because of his height, we called it being "shortphobic"
I love Beans
I'm 6'5 I would take the 4'2 girl he's trippin
That girl that is 5  11 said yuhhh alot 😂
Bro’s a goat
Omg that 5’11 girl was so pretty but her personality was just ‘yuhhhh’ 💀💀
How were all of these women so attractive ?!! They’re all stunning!
1:06
5'11 girl: yuh yuh yuh yuh i hated her
Bro beans look 4’10 when he was with the shortest girl 😂
5’11 girl písese me off
beans looks like a therapist
This was pretty good
i would kill myself if I was that short
I could be wrong, but I do feel like the height is inaccurate!! For sure an exaggeration! Still an awesome video!
"My son is 12. He is actually taller than you." Br00tal
The green shirt girl was kinda mean ngl
He's 5'3?? In cm that's 1.60 right?  I'm 5'3🥲 i though i was taller than him 🥲
The second one is 5'3?? Really??
Beans is a cutie ♥
I'm five ten and i would say yes to beans. I love it when a guy lets me wear heels and he doesn't care that i'm taller than him. I have guy friends who are 6ft 2 in and they make fun of me wen i wear heels because i'm their height, so id take a 5"3' guy who lets me wear heels any day😊
If he was 5-8 to 6ft dear lord he'd be a Chad 100%
The chick in the middle looked so offended at 15:39
Dude.  Beans is freaking amazing.  He's clearly secure and confident, a great communicator, super funny, totally handsome, very respectful and is willing to be flexible with expectations! He's a catch rite there!
My ex girlfriend is a full *12 inches* taller than me and it was totally fine the whole year we were together (and the few years we continued to hook up afterwards (lesbian problems lmaooo)) 🤷‍♀️ She would have to bend down to kiss me and I would stand on my tippy toes to help her out sometimes but it wasn’t ever a big deal.  She wore heels all the time too which made her like 14-16 inches taller than me. I never wear heels, I can’t take two steps in them lol  She’s still one of my best friends so she still has to bend down to hug me whenever we see each other lmao
10:54 to 10:59 was so funny 😂😂
What happened to Chandler 😢😢😢
If the people who look at these commented are subscribed but watch this get a life cause there is no way your watching something you enjoy but you don't sub
send the runner up my way!!! the 5'5 brown hair bomb shell. shorty that he picked literally laugh at beans when his homie walked out. i would have taken the trophy away and handed it to the bomb shell.
I wish they could have taken this a little more seriously and pre screened the girls to give him one’s that would be ok with his height as well as a bigger range between the first and second girl. 4’11-5’3 is actually a big difference. Theres so many beautiful 5’0-5’2 cuties out there!
I'm 5'10 and I'm considered lesbian height...
How did they not have shorter women? I’m 5’2, women 5’3 and under are more common than 6’ and up???
Hemorrhoid rizzb goes hard
He looks like a mix between Harry Potter and Seth Green.
Ok I understand that nipples are not something sexual and men and women can both go out top half naked, but imagine a guy going anywhere with a dress like the girl number 2, that's so weird even for a guy.
Sorry but he looks like MARIO 🤣
this was awesome! well done boys!
6’9 woman is sexy. Would def date. Next to her I’d be tiny. Lol she’s almost a foot taller than me. 5’10
4'9 girl in my mid 20s-have not dated ever. Would I ever be welcome in the dating world?
If somebody w beans' personality.... height is no deal breaker for me ...i mean he's cool,funny and he has that attractive personality 🎉
15:20 number 2 looks sad
bro proved that confidence is everything height don’t matter
Beans: oh nice shirt  Girl:yUhHhH  Beans:*i am confusion*
10:59 PLEASE HELPPPPPPP ME
Beans is sooo funny!!!!!
A good lesson to height-shaming women on what they're potentially missing out on. Women date who they want,  but end up marrying who they can. This gentleman is husband material.
i'm 5'3 thats crazy
This dude is a simp!
Anyone realize this is not actually arracks  channel
got to love the way beans shows respect for the ladyes. the host and his coworker here could learn a lot from him when it comes to treating girls with respect
3:11 is it just me or does she look like Olivia Rodrigo???
Beans is so damn cool
The last girl literally  just about bowed down to hug him around the shoulders.💀
Kayla with the W rizz
Kayla ig????
So… here me out about the first girl
man it's damn hard to find a woman as a 5'3 man, especially these days. He is a real gentleman and I hope he finds the right woman! It would be cool if you would help him!
POV your 14 and your 5,9 thinking your short
Is 5:3 to short Girl: yaaa
Why you helping others get girl friends when you need one
"Number 3! Pick Number 3 my lord!"
Beans is so cute
Oh Beans....why didn't you just reject the girls who told you you were too short right away? You're wasting your time and theirs by continuing to talk to them. Kayla was so cute and funny and you made the right choice choosing her in the end though.
Any guy who is Bean’s height, like this comment. [this is including me]
He said "number 10, a friend of mine *she is single*" like wdym where the other girls not single 😭
It seems all the women 5'11" and taller thought height was a big issue interesting.
Yuh.
Sorry, from one short king to another... your heightism is hypocritcal. In your case, you deserve to be alone.
The ex boyfriend one is hella annoying like stop talking about the ex your on a date girly
i understand the pain of being 6'9 it sucks
Ain’t no way the end of the video was beans talking about his nipple size 😂
It’s gotta hurt if a guy  that is 5, 2 Rejects you that is 4, 2”
How tall is Airrack?
Good on Beans for calling out his cohosts at 11:54 for their behavior at 11:25.  That was rude, and Beans handled it like a gentleman!
That dude has a 10/10 face though. He looks awesome.
This is just sad. Bro shouldn’t have done this. jestermaxx with the YouTubers to try to get some clout. don’t sacrifice ur dignity for the entertainment of rEEE tards
Anita was tight at the end
I'm 5'3 my self, I dated someone who was 5'9 and it was hard at some points. even me as a short king I would prefer someone closer to my height
The yuh girl is a 🚩
11:03 killed me so bad
The girl who was 5'9" was an idiot. She assumed all short guys are bad like her ex. Women. 🤦😂
yuhHhHHhHh
2nd girl had the red bottoms 👀 - what's her @
2:43 that stare 💀
I am the same height as beans at pretty young age😂
Crazy how you have one black woman and compare her to the creature big foot. Nobody else had an animation . Weird…
THE YUHHHHHH GIRL LOOKS LIKE IF BILLIE EILISH WAS A FRAT GIRL
I thought this was an interesting concept and it was interesting to hear Sam’s and the different women’s perspectives.  However, I’m surprised that I haven’t seen anyone else commenting on the interruption. I get that it might be boring to hear the same conversation over and over but did they really have to handle it by interrupting Kyra, the 6’ 2” woman like that? Do they not realize how frequently women, especially women of color are talked over? I really appreciate that Sam called them out on it and picked her even though he knew she wasn’t going to pick him. Also why was she the only one introduced as an Amazonian?
I really thought I would at least be as tall as the third girl, but second chicka has me by an inch 😂❤😅😊
His 'confidence' is 5 inches tall 😅😅😅
He has a really fun personality, I'm surprised so many ladies said no
Great video, there is nothing like a perfect marriage or relationship, I learnt that in everything there is always a solution, 5 years ago I and my wife divorced because we were having some difficulties in our marriage but we are  back together, it was a really bad phase but we got through it.
Olivia Rodrigo
9:47 yuh 9:54 yuh 9:56 true💀 9:58 yuh 10:05 yuh 10:09 yuh
Who is the girl that he picked?
BEANS!!!!!
we talking about short kings but tall queens don’t have appreciation
I’m dying😂😂😭😭
Yuuuhhhh
0:03 what did he say?
the host looks like Liam Hemsworth. are you related to him?
Bro i want to see a dated
The black girl looks bored asf
Im also the shortest I’m 5”3 and 22
We need I got got on get got merch please
She's 5'5 and wants someone that 6'⁉️⁉️ A tad bit weird, but hey, oh well ig
He looks like Daniel Radcliffe
Lord farquad
It gets to the point where you just might as well date a 🌲🤣
Damn that green girl is rude all she says is yaaa
He definitely picked the right girl. Kayla is gorgeous and seems down to earth.
Man that black girl he chose reminds me 100% of my coworker. Looks and verbal/body language. RUN!
Damn. Why reject the short girl? I thought you'd have had the most in common with her.
Bro I'm ten and 4 in taller than Beans.
You have a Netflix show
I wonder what the energy would be like if the dude was Jeff Nippard or someone of similar size.
I am 6'1 but never had a girlfriend  Bcs this is avarage in Austria🇦🇹 😢
YO NIGGA
what was beans saying at the end of the video💀
The only reason I watch this is because I'm short too 🤣
After seeing the response from most women today, I swear I expected the 4'3 girl to say "I really prefer 6ft and taller"
"I would ride the roller coaster"  Beans: *Removes BLM from bio😊
Now i'm interested and want to know if they are together 😃
Does anybody know who is the third  girl ?
The edited in dolphin was brutally awesome :D
W Beans <3
Thank you HouseParty and friends for this amazing content i really appreciate it.
A tall women will accept a short king IF he's packin.
Im short but at least tall people struggle to always having to bend down in smaller areas like the car while i can just go in without bending down lol
This just shows how shallow girls are compared to men. Keep exposing them.
I have a mission to watch every house party video and this is the 9th vid i watch
we need a talk show with beans and laura
In my country there's a lot of guys that are 5'3 or smaller but i thought this guy was like 4'7 or smth
This is scripted
I didn't realize how small he was. He should get that height surgery
Man 5’10 look like giants lmaooo I’m 5’10 and I’m short lmaoo lmaoo

Beans is a KING! ❤
I’m married to a short king who is a lot like Sam: respectful to everyone, humble, full of energy and positivity. He has treated me well every day of our marriage, no matter what life has thrown at us. Ladies, if you ever get the chance to date a guy like this don’t pass it up lightly. Guys like these are treasures and I thank God I was lucky enough to marry one.
Beans don't worry about your nipples 😎
YUHH
2:47 The golphin. Guys what the freak 😂
So.....Are they dating?  someone please let me know. I can't keep living live without knowing!!!!

Wait, was that an Indian song at the end? Who is your editor?
Nah man that girl at 10:58 you did her so wrong😂
her name was kayla and she passed with ''flying colors'' but wait, kayla is a song from a  band named flying colors, r u hinting towards something?
So no one is gonna talk abt how he startled randomly talking on how his left nipple is bigger than his right nipple 💀
10:08 bro did she spawn from 2012 she just keeps saying yuh

The girl he picked was bad

As a short king, I’ve dated girls taller than me, but only by one inch😂. I’d be so open to dating a tall queen, the tallest girl I’ve ever been wit is 5.8. For reference I am 5.4 and a half #shortking
beans says they call it the dump truck Airrack says thats why they took you out to the trash
Yuuuuh
Get rejected for something you can never change is the worst thing in the life.
The one black girl that comes on here, y’all introduce her coming through the Forrest like a Bigfoot 😂😂😂😂😂 so wrong
I didn’t like the girl in the green shirt cause she was talking down to my boy beans

MY BROTHER IS TALLER  THAN BEANS HE IS 10

Help the end😂
5,9 was so bad
5"11 girl: yuh  Me: I'm dying  5"11: yuh Me:OH MY GOD A BOMB 5"11: yUh
Why did 5"5 girl look like Olivia Rodrigo to me? 😂
why did you change your name to houseparty
“YUH,YUH,YUH” ENOUGH GAWD DAMN
Why does she always say yeah
As a short man I just wanna say... If you call yourself a short king... You're a muppet
so we just gonna ignore the end where the girl he picked was staring hard at him ( 15:36 ) they are def a match born in heaven
12:09 SixNine or 69?
What is the name of the song at the end I love that tune

Beans kinda a chad
I mean… I’m 6’2 and my boyfriend of 9 years is 5’7 and all I can say…. height really doesn’t matter if you are happy with yourselves and don’t care what others think. There are zero issues when it comes to sex either. Go short kings 🥰
Shouldve put the 4’2 lady next to the 6’9 lady
Bro brought olivia rodrigo 😅
The best thing about Jesus, is that multiple people have different conversations about couples and it last forever w rizz beans

look at the girl in the res dress at 4:50
Was the girl in green shirt retarded? Lol
He should have picked the first girl for the top 3.  She had a great personality, and would have been a good match.    However, in the end, he chose the best girl !!!  I hope they actually go on a few dates.
W choice beans
Actually our fingers are different than each other one tall one short✋ But actually if you close your hand they all gonna be the same
Yuhhh

Beans I don’t think anyone’s concerned about your nipples 😂
That girl that won looks just like Maddie zingler
beans is such a nice guy, never got to see this much of his personality
I never knew he was that short, 5'11 even looks like a giant compared to him😭🤣
Kayla might actually like him she was laughing after everything he said there at the end.
Beans is so sweet 😞❤️
As a remember of the short community, we didn’t like Diana
I like the ending!  Would be awesome to have the whole audience leave as well like the old times :D
this gave me second hand embarrassment
Height aside dude he ended up giving the trophy to the most attractive one (they are all gorgeous ladies)... Damn she has the most gorgeous hair the most beautiful eyes the most amazing smile and laugh.. She is so perfect 😊😊
I felt his speech in the end credits ‼‼🔊🔊🗣🗣 We making out of the nipple factory with that one🦹‍♂🦹‍♂
Harry Potter brother❤😂
THE END HELP
Damn never knew I would look that small from that perspective, I am 5'3 and a male
As a 6’4 guy and still growing, I could not imagine dating someone that was taller than me lmao 😂. But I would not be opposed to dating a taller woman
You gotta update ussss if beans is dating her like this so they can see this
Damn that woman at 10:45 seem to have a ego issue of not wanting to be rejected
The legendary wingman strikes again
new channel the fuck? Where is arrack?
Am short queen😂
MY AUNT IS THE FIRST ONE AIRRACK WHAAT
diana the green shirt was a piece of work.
Green tall girl was weird in a really bad way 👎
Best YouTuber ever
I didn’t realize how short Beans was until the 5’11 girl came out cause I’m 6ft…
yuhhh
Yuhh
Eric was done at the end 😭😭😭
Ayyyy let's go
I think I'm 6 footh
yuHhhH YuhhHh tRuee yUhHhH
Anita is an actor from @SameerBhavnai  https://youtu.be/3UY44TCVdwU
Beans is my favorite He's actually my profile picture on one of my mini games 😂
Anyone else have a short person kink?😭😭😭
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
hey can we talk about airacks hight and the lady the was lebrons hight 6,9
get me on this show please 5’10 girl was so gorgeous omg
When I saw the title short king I thought of beans lol!
They make beans look so much shorter than he is
I hate the 5’11 girl cause she was just so annoying and she always said “yuuuhh”
Diana was the worst actual person, I couldn't spend 2 minutes with her. Lol
how tall is beans
I think so ! Airack is performing to tall in the end
why is airracks name "house party" now ?
I’m a connoisseur of short kings being that I’m only 4’10. Anything taller than 5’9 is tooooooo tall for me 😂
Yuuuuuuuuh
Bru i thought Anita Was Olivia Rodrigo when she walked in 😭
beans is so nice
I'm 15 Standing at 6'2 parents are 5'10 and 5'11 I'm Supposed to grow to 6'7 XD I should be included in this
Beans:my real name is Sam    Eric:I didn’t ask   Me:😂😂😂😂😂😂
Beans is so handsome with a great personality to match. The hosts taking the piss out of the only two black women is very yukky.
Yeee
Yes
That girl in green shirt must be on some drugs 😂 yaaaa brooo
As a 5'9 12 year old (Yes, I'm not lying, i am 100% sure that that is my height), My Respect goes out to Beans. He is my favorite Person On Airrack. Short Kings Slayy
Bean is such great guy🤌
Yes we read it
IDK why but I thought this channel was your main channel but with a diff name
So thats what I would look like next to them
"You know what is not hard "me here expecting smth sus.
❤❤❤❤🔥
wtf was the last outro part XD
Can you help me find a girlfrend
As a short king I can confirm he made the right choice
hard to watch✅ hard while watching❌
hiii'
Oddly enough he chose the hottest 1
This video actually opened my eyes to what someone like beans would have to go through and I have a lot of respect for him, dude is the kindest guy ever legit I hope he finds love ❤
That sponsor was smooth bro💖 also gold star for beans putting up with him 😂
There is a reason why there is a height requirement for rollercoasters, so the girl who said he would sneak him in the rollercoaster will be liable for the next injuries or maybe even death if its a fast, looping, etc rollercoaster.
Where is he the king of
“yuuuuh” - Diana, 2023
All of these girls are so pretty
yuhh
Beans really had to get nerfed, otherwise itd be over for everyone
I don't ever wanna hear women complain that men only care about looks. This dude had charisma and personality but his height alone disqualified him from most of them. That's what we would call superficial. He didn't care about being shorter, but women care about being taller.   Men aren't the issue. We aren't insecure about our height. Women are. Just saying.
Can't get enough of your shows Airrack.
that girl with the green button up shirt was so rude for no reason😭
that one girl that kept saying yuhhhh 😭
that one girl that rejected him and then just vented abt how her ex broke her heart is so funny to me
How tall is beans?
NGL UR ALWAYS SPONSORED BY SHOPIFI
So is that first girl available?
how tall is bro?
Does nobody noticed that Tyler and airrack have massed up a lot in muscle. Love to see you guys bettering yourself every video. Keep up the hard work and I’ll see you guys up there soon🤝
the tallest person when beans was hugging her she looked like the mum caroline
The 5'8 Grace person looks just like Brett Cooper lol
yuh
girl in the green was too confident😂😂😂
Yaaaaaa
We need beans a talkshow
When that girl said yuuuhhh I felt a sudden very big amount of rage
These dating shows are nuts , i can watchh 100 videos a day
so you own Jubilee now nice.
As a short person i too agree that dating a girl is a serious problem
Beans ❤
We need more videos with beans he is so kind
Guys he did the thing he said he was leaving
why dont you bring some decent girls not according to looks according to the values
Skibdi toilet
Guy: I don't care Woman: what if I care? I love that women are not going back on their opinion being heard. Men need to learn its not all about what they want.
I love Sam/Beans! Never stop being a kind, genuine, and honest person! We need more people in this world like you!
“Yuhhh” “true”😂😂
I died when the girl stomped on Beans 😭😂 10:58
Honestly third girl looked like Olivia Rodrigo
beans is really the sweetest person i swear
L girl in green
I’m glad the women voiced “but what if I care”. It’s not always about you MEN. Lol the intro took me out “you get to keep 3 of them”… like excuse me? 😂
irru nalla iruka thambi ~ beans alva edison 2026
YuuuUUAaaaAhhhhHhh😩✊
I didn't realize how small he actually was lol
Beans has a lot of traits that as a man I strive to have, such a good soul, ngl my life has been really SHITTY recently and this really cheered me up. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
THE FIRST GIRL HAS A GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
What happens if you put pizzafy on Pizza?
I wishes Bean trashed that woman who's looking down at him abd being such a jerk. But kudos to Bean for not doing that.
Beans got the Rizz, but only half the time, he is still a great man and a G
who else wanted to hear the whole breakup story
“You know what’s not hard” thought it was a blue chew commercial
w beans
That’s Lana Rhodes
The yah girl is so annoying
Come on boys let’s get this man to 1M! I’m stoked to see what you got for us Airrack.
Beans and Kayla are a match made in heaven! hope they’re having a toxic ass summer rn
“can you help me down”😂😂😂
All that one girl did was talk about how she was done with relationships because her boyfriend broke up with her 3 years ago and then he still said she was a delightful person😂
I’m a short king.. 5’4 and 18 years old hopefully I can grow a little taller to reach my potential height
Girl in green insufferable
❤❤❤great job beans, you've got the lines and the signs. bachelor life isnt as nice as married. Youve found the right people so now work to pay the bills. Awesome content and stay healthy.❤❤❤but careful signing those documents.
Beans's shorter than me and still gets more women than me
That one chick needs a dictionary 😂 yuhhh
Yuhhh yuhhh
8 was super mean Jesus Christ
Bro fr said 5'9 is tall
1st had a HUUGEE dumpy tho
eric man when will you reply me on instagram?
Not the second shortest being taller then me (::
The ending xD
54 inches is the lowest height on most rolor coasters so he would not be too short
IS BEAN THAT SHORT💀
Bro I’m 5,5 and I’m 12 so I’m taller than beans
E
this video was so funny
You should do a short person go on a date with tall men
I’m 5’10 and my boyfriend is 5’5. Last Halloween, he was a Koala and I was a Eucalyptus Tree. We love embracing our height difference and honestly at the end of the day, we barely even notice it (unless I need to reach something on the top shelf for him). :-)
😂
ah... luv beans, hes the best
My partner is 5’4 n im 5’7. At first I cared abt his height than after I stopped caring..mainly just bc I got used to it n became ok with it n fell in love with who he was not his height.
beans is actually a really cool guy, my grandma was crossing the street when he pulled up to pick her up on his shoulders and put her back to the start because the traffic lights were green. thanks so much beans, my grandma owes you her life.
I love both kinds of beans.
Can that 5”11 Bru say anything but yahhh
As a fellow short king I feel his pain
Dude, lol, i cant watch these videos without pausing to cringe. :D
Me who literally doesn’t care about height
1:14 aye if she down then im down
Beans is such a gentleman during the whole video making sure they are all confortable and enjoy the moment, where some of the girls didn't even care or have respect towards beans (probably cause they didn't know the subject before the video ?) some don't even deserve to be here, hope beans finds true love still <3
Yuhhhh
i love beans he such a great guy and funny
the greatest thing is watching this being shorter than beans (5' 1/2") and dating someone who is 5' 11"
Where is Lexi revera
Once sam hits his growth spurt he will be unstoppable.
Beans: says literally anything 5’11 girl: Yuh  Beans: I’m about to throw up  5’11 girl: Yuh
Short king? Is that what midgets call themselves nowadays?
The one in green was high af 😭😭
Middle girl stole my heart ❤
Finally, been missing these type of videos ✨
That girl with the green shirt had to be high
I’m one bit shortr then the shortest girl bc I’m 41
Size doesn’t matter
What’s hemroids
Beans is low key handsome
they should have found a 4'7 and a 5'0 contestant. the girls he chose had no interest in him and it was kind of sad to see how much of a joke they thought it was
As a guy with 160cm i feel this man
Maricella: Yahhhhh Yahhhh
Not the nipple talk at the end 🤣💀
Beans, my man!
Jubilee ripoff??.?..

Fourth woman was lying about loving working at a coffee shop you can tell by the way she looks away from him when she says it. Liers look away when they are usually telling a lie
I think the contestant number 8 was fking high in all of the senses:))
"Cool Beans" 👁
we don’t say “short,” we say “vertically challenged”
10:54 had me rolling on the floor 😂😂

5 11 girl kept saying yah

Can I be in a video like this but for kids
Beans is the KING of the short kings!!!
I mean, it was obvious from the beginning. Congratulations Beans!
😮bring lara back
Yuhhhh
i love beans
Yuhhhhh
Im only 5,4 at 13
I never realized how short he actually was 😂
No one talks about it but beans (Sam) is actually so attractive. Not to mention he’s so sweet and kind ❤️
So bad this new channel is cringe and it feels scripted older channel is better
nahhhh wtf is this end bro💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro the girl in the green made me annoyed😂
What does that mean at 5:40
A women shortest to tallest woman.
Shart king
who wasnt ready about the end ☠☠☠☠
I would love to in beans in spot
I love beans man
holy crap i died with the forest seen with the tall girl and beans 😂
It is so frustrating for me. Why are women allowed to pick guys with certain heights and not get accused of body shaming but when men express their oppinions that they want a woman who is at least in shape and not fat the get accused of body shaming. (English is not my first language sorry)
Still so cute my boyfriend very tall
i’m sorry hate me but i hate how that girl in green was towards beans and the last third girl. plenty of ways to just say no thank you in a respectful way. just my opinion
Let's gooooo! This is what we've been waiting for 🎉
the moment i saw that girl i knew , they already look alike
nah beans is the best
THE OUTRO 😂
That girl in the green is definitely close to brain dead
Hi
“5 inches” “That’s not that much” 🥲
I think Sam is a catch! He has a great personality, handsome and not afraid to be vulnerable! I hope he finds the love of his life who will be one lucky lady! ❤
Bro the chick in the green is on some of the Za
Eric, how do I help to work with you?
when airrack made a noise in the microphone i started dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro I love the show! So much better than that woke ass jubilee nectar content. We love beans (short kings for life) 👑
Beans and Kayla should def date. Also that girl in the green's vibes were so OFF.
“ I have a hemorrhoid “ 😭😭
Lol
This hd me laughing the whole time lol 😂😂😂
Beans is a legend!
That one girl who kept going yuhhhh yuhhh
yuhhhhhhh!
yes
That girls is not 5’3 without heals😭 I’m 5’1 and she literally looks my height
Yuhhhh
Nah the women on the show were brutal, justice for Beans ✊
You guys are awesome
bro why tf is diana saying yuhhhh
hi
Love it, very entertaining! I hope they work out lol.
W rizz hopefully brother stays with her haha
Nice
If you give all your friends gf they’ll leave you😭
Beans look like Ron swanson from parks and recs
This is pretty funny .
My frend is 13 and is 7’1
what happend to the blond guy
idk for me since I’m short I don’t care for height but nothing short haha
bro cant wait for house party to make it to their goal!
it’s so funny they are all still talll I am 5’1
Eric does the best add reads
Claim your ticket if your early
Shoulda put @tinyytino on here
That’s a fire shirt
laura and diana made me laugh so hard😭😭
My partner is over a foot taller than me and DEFINITELY has neck issues
They did kira dirty😂
“Yuhhhhh” “trueee” she fuckin on sum😂
Lara (5’9) is so damn insecure
2:21 now I understand why they wanted him to wear the glasses...
Yuh
Beans on airrack vs beanz on jakerton
We love you Beeeaaaannns, we do!
https://youtu.be/3UY44TCVdwU
Hi
I’m 13, and 5,8…
Beans is the coolest dude
Not beans talking abt his nipples at the end😂
YUUUUUHHH 😭😂😭
Hi
ednida needs to find her date too! she seemed super nice and sweet! and really cared about beans!
I really want to work with you guys Airrack I have been with you guys since you had 30k subscribes I love you guys, i love you work, i love everything about you guys and working with you guys is like a dream for me. Great respect to you guys ❤️🫶🏾
Was the one girl high?
Heartbroke girl seemed like a potential good friend idk😅
Funny
6:10 I didn’t know that colors can fly
Woah okay then  😂😂😂.
Whats a “hemy” whatever he said
The end man 😂😂😂😂
After watching Beans meeting these girls we could all agree that he’s a gentlemen…
That “You guys?” was personal
The last 2 stomping 😂
As a short girl (5"1), I'd definitely be able to date Beans and his height wouldn't be an issue, but somehow wouldn't date anyone shorter than me. Not sure why!
That last scene though 😭😭
outro hindi song is awesome
I want second episode with details what happened after , I hope they together lol cute girl
9:45 “🤩🎉🤭✨😋yUuUuUhHhH😋✨🤭🎉🤩”
Bro why did he brought up a topic about one of his nipples are bigger than other 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
A few months ago, I found out Beans’ real name was Sam, and I couldn’t sleep for a week
4:41 not my 🍆
yuhhh
Honestly it might just be me but I like seeing when someone releases a video then like an hour later or something they change the thumbnail because I like seeing the difference in them even though it isn't huge most times
I love beans/Sam
The one in the green dress was just despicable
kind of silly system deciding before having seen all of them^^
💀
Dianna, the 5'11 girl looks high asf
i’m taller than beans and i’m 13
Nipple talk💀💀
They did Beans dirty in the thumbnail💀💀💀
love short kings 😻
He’s just too funny
How tall is he?
bro the 5.11 what is her opsesion with saying yuh💀
10:49 😂
Left nipple is bigger than the right 😂😂😂💀💀💀
this shit was gas!
Airrack pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease live a heart, I love u man!
LOL  10:54 🎉❤ And Keep up the good work Eric!!😊
Yaaaaa
Beans is such a humble, funny character😂. Great video as always.
Having short height and watching these can actually like facing the reality irl 😢😅
damn he can’t toss the 2nd chick aroundddd
9:50 Why is she talking like that Lol
The more that I look at beans he gets shorter every time
out of the 3 he picked the 2nd was bueatiful
Beans didn't pick the only girl that also pressed yes, too!
Haha social media has ruined the 1st world women. Population decline inbound.
Bruh these taller girls are literally so rude
