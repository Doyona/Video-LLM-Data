WALES WALES WALES
That Ramsey has got a big move in him
When you realise what happens when Ramsey scores…
Robbie Savage was brilliant this game
oh no 2 other people
The strongest Welsh players today was danny ward,  Gareth bale and ramsey . Ramsey and bale could help Scotland with attack you know
2:25 Wow
Hello
What a team you are wales . Very proud.  If we finished our chances,  we could of won 0_4
Like to see wales do well against denmark...northern ireland fan 💚💚💚
Brilliant from the whole team bit especially Ramsey and Bale. I had to comment as there were 999 comments therefore this is the 1000th comment
Dark horses cant even score a goal 🤣🤣
Wales>england
For a moment I thought Turkey were playing Australia!! Why are Wales wearing the Australian football kit!!!???
Fellas, its football not rugby, youre meant to kick it under the bar
That Welsh number 11 is  a dead ringer for that bit part player who stole a living from Spurs last season
Even Wales are better than England...
Wales playing better then England, more creative and a better team.
Fantastic result. Well done Wales!
The real question is, what famous person is dying in the next 7 days thanks to Ramsey's goal?
Bale and Rambo work well together
Bales assists and Ramsey’s running into space is out of this world perfect duo.. the whole team impressed compared to the first game especially Dan James he brings so much to the team.. we’ll done lads making the country proud
Lets keep this form going into Italy game cmon wales !!!!!
bloody Marxist hypocrits.
Cymru am byth! Bale brilliance beats the Turks.
Result for Wales and good footage. Shame it was spoiled by Linikers appearance at the end....
As a Welshman I know we are living through the greatest era in Welsh football. It's a fantastic feeling that's lasted since the last Euro's, I just hope these times can last and really inspire future generations, to at least regularly compete in major tournaments.
Well done Wales, your probably through to the knockouts like England are.

Bale was good apart from the penalty
Such a satisfying win after all of those comments pre match, from Turkish trolls to English fans and pundits who said we would finish rock bottom. You never learn... Oh and all that talk of Turkey being "dark horses". Wales turned the dark horses into glue. Never write us off so early! 💪
People need to realise that Wales are a top team in world football and can beat any nation,they are a formidable force  and have been for years,only stronger this team will get,Italy should be very nervous as I said before the draw Wales will top this group and IL stick by it,they will go to Italy with game plan to beat them 👍
Well done Wales 💪💪  Ryan Giggs is a scumbag
So enjoying the var and refereeing in the tournament so far makes our Premier league versions a joke in comparison
Well done Wales congrats on your Win from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏆
Wonder which celebrity will die now
Bale is good at passing.. Bale takes penalty.. someone: Is this guy a professional or an amateur?
This is a massive result for Wales and the travelling fans are going absolutely cotty.
What's Bales golf handicap
Bale is the pogba of wale with the spectacular pass vision to Ramsey
I actually thought I would never in my life see Bale miss a pen that bad. It was so bad ut was actually funny! 😅
Well done WALES !!!  Good luck Boyos - Regards from your neighbours in England
Football's coming home..... To GB 🇬🇧
Ramsay is so shit
2ND GOAL IS OFFSIDE
Well done to the welsh was cheering in England for ya's !
Happy for connor roberts
Defund the BBC
One of the worst penalty kicks I've ever seen. Great, exciting game. So pleased for Wales. Quality football, unlike the England game which looked like 90 mins of dreary passing practice.
Only 230k views on the video.  Why do I think it would be a lot more had we lost
Don't want to be missing those against the bigger teams!  Hopefully will be more settled in the next game.
Should have been 4 or 5. That may come back to haunt us.
Dai was watching a Six Nations game in Cardiff. In the packed stadium there was only one empty seat, right next to him. “Whose is that seat?” asked a man in the row behind. “I got the ticket for my wife,” said Dai. “But she died in an accident.” “So you’re keeping the seat vacant as a mark of respect?” “No,” said the fan, “I offered it to all of my friends.” “So why didn’t they take it?” “They’ve all gone to the funeral.”
The real question is how costly will that bale missed pen be to goal difference
As a Welsh man the only thing that spoilt this game for me was them taking a fucking knee !!!
Jesus turkey are absolute trash aren’t they 😂
Love my country. Language passion and being a celt
Why don't players ever run to the players that assist them ?
Ffs Turkey what are you doing how are you allowing wales to beat you Kmt
Coulda bloody beat them 6-0
Bale is pure quality, it’s a shame he somewhat gets overlooked
Lots of love from England fans to Wales here. Lots of harmony and love. Shame cant be with Scotland who are bitter and like the young egoistic stubborn sibling
Wales to beat England
come on wales! support from scotland.
Well done TAFF'S brilliant 🍀⚽
That assist from Bale to Ramsey was a thing of beauty! 🥵🔥
Wales will beat England
Should have given that pen to Moore because for Cardiff he's scored single penalty he's been given and for Bale it's been a while
Ramesays runs into the box are ridiculously good
Lesson for kids. Don't try an knuckleball a penalty, kick it normally.
Bales throw is insane
I am an England fan but it’s great to see Wales get results like these. They play with so much passion and have several quality players. It’s a shame they could not go back in time and have, Giggs, Rush and Speed in the team. I think they can get to the Semi finals again
Great game
Great result Wales , I hope we can get a result against England tomorrow night 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
It is beyond me whu bale wants to retire. When he is motivated to play he is such a good player
Now let’s cut to England at euro 96 fo no reason
That Turkey team is a disgrace
Bale on form is a joy watch
Ramsey has really been practicing those runs, snd for bale to find him all 3 times thats got to be no fluke, well played them two especially both missed sitters tho
Great win for Wales and two quality assists from Bale. Better teams are going to punish them though and that penalty.... 😳
Don't think people realise Wales are 17th in the rankings and drew with a Full strength USA side with their 2nd/3rd string side. They aren't mugs anymore. Yes they still aren't on the level of teams in the top 10. But what they do with what they have to work with....outstanding.
Nobody noticed what happened last time when Ramsay scores
I still don’t think Bale is worth £600k per week, but he is clearly very very good; much better than he was at the start of the season
Could hear Spoons from the train station as my train pulled in past 10 last night. Was an incredible game. If Ramsay can keep up them runs and the rest of the team can keep giving him and Moore opportunities I think we can make a splash.
Wales just look great. Strong, confident and they look like they're having a blast, too.
Do Wales ever let themselves down in any sport? Were brilliant the last euros. Always give a good account of themselves in the rugby. Hell even going back to the likes of Joe Calzaghe! They’ve got something right within their setup and long may it continue!!
Gareth Bale did a classic Wayne Rooney shot with that missed penalty.
Very likeable this Welsh team hope they will go a distance in this. From Slovak Fan
I enjoyed this video until champagne socialist Gary Lineker appeared at the end.
Would love to see him in Arsenal shit again!
Ramsey had some chances that game and bales vision was amazing well done
that first assist from Bale is as good an assist as we'll see all tournament. On a level with Pogba
Danny Ward is class he's doing really well
My friend is a turkey fan and he said Wales are going to get smashed by turkey boy was he wrong 😂
Hope Ancelotti gives Bale a chance at Real Madrid next season.
We know what Bales doing in training today
Double win from a Greek who lives in Cardiff :))
Real Madrid to juventus? What?
What a performance from ❤
As an England fan and my partner welsh fan ...we were bouncing for Wales! What a great game of football world class Wales we hope you go far 👍
Am turkish and I had to say turkey doesn’t deserve to be in this competition!  Garbage football.
WAIT A MINUETE RAMSEY SCORED

i think that’s the difference between scotland and wales, wales have a world class forward that can create and is very clinical also.
Well done Wales .A brilliant display and good luck for the rest of the tournament .From a Scotsman who loves the Welsh.👌
Let's see when they come up.against half decent team.
3:09 Bale went off celebrating by himself
Where is the Burak fight? That was the most entertaining part of the match
Turkey is good with mushrooms
Well done Wales may we meet in the final.👍🏻👍🏻👊🏻 I know that it's unlikely but it would be fun to have an England vs Wales final.
Well done Wales 👏 from Northern Ireland fan right behind you enjoy your journey in euros
From an English fan, well done wales.. great pressure. Hopefully we fuck the Scots off and meet you down the line
They left out the fight. SMH.
If only Bale and Ramsey could imagine the goal as the succulent rear end of a Sheep, they could have beat Turkey 4 or 5.
Bale was outstanding gutted about the penalty miss tho but well done to the boys well deserved come on 👏👏 .. Bless up . ✌📿⚽️
Bale doesn't play out time at the corner flag...he goes for the throat Twice...what a unique class act!
End of the first half I was buzzing. But the second half I was a nervous wreck, especially after that penalty miss. But I'm so proud of the boys. Bale was absolutely phenomenal, his passing was world class.  Happy 2016 wasn't a fluke. Wales are here to compete.
was in work and the tv was on with the game. everyone was literally just looking at the tv instead of paying attention to our jobs. lol both managers literally were stood in front of the tv. btw from wales
Robbie savage is terrible
How did Australia get into the Euros? 🤣
Wales out here looking like Australia in that kit 😂
For some reason, ITV turned the crowd noise up for their highlights.......but i will say this, though, it certainly made their highlights, seem so more dramatic....
As an Englishman I can gleefully say.. up the welsh well done bale what a player
I was so nervous right up untill Robbo scored. So proud of each and everyone of those Welsh boys they did the country proud🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Not surprising they won, they were wearing Australia's kit.

Bale penalty😀😀😀
Wait wasn’t Bale offside on the second goal?🤣
Proud welshman tonight 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Well done 👏 WALES FROM SCOTLAND!!!
Pure quality from the Welsh, but Italy will decimate them.
Well played Wales (insert Welsh flag emoji here.)
Well played wales, very happy for any uk country that wins tbh..
Gareth bale carrying this team no matter what
Pathetic  penalty man bun.
Turkey had so much promise coming into this tournament, they are so far the biggest failures of Euro 2020.
Great game Wales. You guys smashed it. Hope you make it through to the last 16 and beyond. From an England fan 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Imagine if Ramsey could finish...
The best British country at it again COME ON WALES
Well done wales from an English man who's supported them for 32 years
No doubt Wales deserved to win that game. Justice was done on that penalty miss, though. Bale was looking for the foul but there wasn't even any contact. It isn't the first time he's dived and it won't be the last time. Surely the commentator should have seen that.
Well done Wales. Couldve had 5 or 6. Cant believe how poor Turkey have been.
Excellent play from Bale mashallah! one of my favourite players from when i was a kid however if he scored that penalty it wouldve been the icing on the cake inshallah next time bro you made your country proud🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿❤️‼️‼️
Whales love to eat Turkey 🦃
Very Biased commentary in this match from Savage and Wilson during the live match, they need to be way more impartial. It's not professional
Bale was on another level !
what did he mean by saying 'from Real Madrid to Juventus'?
That pass from Bale for the first goal was absolutely world class
Can you stop having spoilers in the title of the video?
Wow bale and Ramsey do have some good link up play
I’m English but I have welsh blood in me so cmon Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Gareth balee  ...best
Well done to the Aussies
well done wales ! hope too see you later in the tournament
Well done Wales from Scotland 👏👏👏
This was such an entertaining game
Bale took a nice dive for the penalty 🤣
Thumbs down every BBC VIDEO!
Dan Biggar would have been proud of that conversion.
Amazing, yes!
"Real Madrid to Juventus" Think you mean Spurs to Juve smh
*EVERYONE* You have been trained and tricked into drinking alcohol since you were 17.  Alcohol is a toxic drug, poisonous, and cancerous. It damages your muscles, bones, cartilage, heart, liver, brain, pancreas, every organ in your body especially if you drink more than 2 drinks in one night.  This damage is cumulative if you keep drinking regularly, 20% damage in your teens, 40% damage in your 20s and 60%+ when you're in your 30s onwards which leads to serious disease.  Your body warns you that you are damaging it when you are drunk and get hungover, these are not normal or acceptable for your natural body.  No celebs drink or barely do, even though they may trick you into drinking. Alcohol is good for business profits, government taxes and the medical profession as it makes people sick. 100s die everyday due to alcohol, 1000s are disabled with pancreatitis, liver/heart disease which is deliberately not reported by the media!  Alcohol controls population numbers.
Bale went from prime pirlo to Heskey and then back to pirlo again real quick 😂
I think robbie forgot bale went back to spurs
WELL DONE WALES SEE IN THE THE  FINAL LOVE ENGLAND.....PEACE
Ramsay each time after missing: 😱
Savage is just insufferable
Bale hair looks like pebbles flintstone.
Well played Wales, Bale's pen was hilarious though
Everyone that slates bale has dissapeared he’s always been one of the best players in the world he’s a phenomenal talent and a great big game player carrying his team good on him well done bale
Well there's no need to cry..
As usual so much noise , boo , hype from turkey fans while their team fails to live up to that hype . Well done  wales . You won me 200 bucks today
Llongyfarchiadau, Cymru! Congratulations, Wales!
Not a mention of bale in the title here… 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yma o hyd 👍
Shame about the penalty but regardless of what Zidane thinks Bale is still a great player.
If only bale scored the penalty, 2 assist one goal it would’ve been a good match He was quality today
that dive from bale...wasn't even in penalty area! var si shite
Ramsey missed a few sitters there..
Well done lads, it's great seeing that we can create so many clear cut chances but we have to be more clinical.
good god, that pass, control and finish for the first goal 😍  that was a dive by bale so justice was done when he missed
Rambo boi
Ramsey is always available to receive the ball in space... fantastic player 👏👏
Bales penalty was absolutely Shite
Turkey is absolutely disappointing.  Which is mean we need to win vs Wales . See you on Sunday 😀
Phenomenal game well done to Wales.
OKÜZ
Turkey Manager needs to be sacked
England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿and Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 out of the group stage 🤞
That corner was so clever. Well done Wales, I'm behind you 100%, just don't do this to England please
Wales   Golf   Madrid
Aaron ramsey couldve been top scorer today lol
Had to win otherwise it was over for Wales
Who else heard Bale yell 'FORE' before that pen
Great win but the crying from the fans, a bit over the top.
The comments are disabled that have the knee bending before the match channels. Wonder why ?
Well done wales from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Well done Australia sorry I mean wales😁
Any 1 tell bale there no planes to hit out the sky now with covid??? Come on england friday put scots out the euros
Well done Wales from England.
Wale's actually deserve the best honestly.. the fans don't expect much but they're building a really good consistent team with some stars.
Wales were superb. Should have won by 3 or 4
Well done our Welsh brothers!!! From your English brothers 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Can’t believe i thought turkey were the dark horse
Turkey is a third world country and Erdogan is a third world dictator.
The fact that the game had technical difficulties showing the coverage. Wales you played good. :)
A lot of big teams have hard time beating Turkey and Wales did a marvellous job
Easy to forgive the penalty miss considering how brilliant he played
Turkey really are shocking.
As an Arsenal fan we let players go and they become better 👊🏽😂
Can we just appreciate bale
Didn't know Australia was in europe
I'm so glad I didn't fall into the turkey hype, best they can now get is 3rd if they beat Switzerland, and last of they draw
3:02 offside?
Ramsey and Bale showed their class tonight
Can't believe Danny Ward is only a number 2 keeper. He has been immense playing for Wales.
Is there an assist of the tournament award? Because Bale has 2 that are worthy of inclusion. The first was inch perfect the second he just drew everyone to him and gave Connor Roberts a sitter. That's how you know a player is special. When he let his side down with the penalty miss he dug deep and assured the win in the end. 👊 Cymru am byth 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
well in the welsh...... you bloody sleep lovers
I expected Turkey to perform better. I remember them to always try at least. At this competition they look tired and boring. One of the disappointments of this tournament.
Yes Cymru
Bale returns to being world class just when Wales are in need of it.
Even as an England fan, I have to say fair play to Wales. Congratulations lads👍🏻
Dragon eats turkey
Never knew australia were in the euros
Bale as good as won the game for wales
C’mon Wales. Wishing you all the best from Scotland. :-)
Ramsey should have had 4. Bale was in a different class.
How does everyone think wales will do in the euros?
Dan James is such a bang average footballer. His final ball is league 1 quality at best… how is he an international footballer player man
Bales vision and passing in that was world class, Ramsey should have had a hat trick in that game thanks to bale
Very disappointing turkish side.
He used the wrong club for the penalty
What ever happened to a normal run up for a penalty?
That right there people, that's the real dark horses. We're not here to make up for the numbers CYMRU AM BYTH
Jesus how bad was Ramsay
What a game, end to end stuff and by far the game of the Tournament
Bale just used spurs as a training session for the euros
Who needs stress, anxiety, caffeine & over exercising to give you heart palpitations when you already have international tournament football 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Cymru am byth
Bale looks for the pen... Dives and misses the penalty 😂😂😂
That was not a penalty. Bale was on the penalty box line, not inside it.
Well I guess someone going to die now
Bale showing his quality it’s a shame that his career got ruined in the latter parts of his time at Real Madrid barely getting played which caused lack of motivation would still be a world class player if he wasn’t hated by zidane
Ardderchog!
Was a little surprised how poor Turkey were defensively. Not sure why anybody had them as a dark horse. They're the worst team in the group
Getting howlin tonight!
Turkey is the most overrated team in this tournament
Aaron Ramsey is so dangerous. What a player gets and creates so many chances
Bale this bale  that . Ramsey won that game
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you  Jesus is coming back very soon. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God...
Bale has lowered himself to Kane's level. Not surprising since they play together.
Well done Wales....outstanding 👏
Everyone saying Turkey are dark horses, literally conceded three against Latvia 🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻
As an Englishman, I wish Wales all the best in the Euros, as i did in the last one. They don't seem as prone to the Anyone But England syndrome as the Scots. Tidy team this year with a bit of real quality. First goal is class.
Brilliant Wales. Lions Cmon.x
So they draw against an avergae swiss team getting battered by italy atm and beat a terrible turkey team, if you listen to savage youd think they were playing like 1970's brazil
Brilliant lads, absolutely brilliant! Not just the win, but the way in which you passed and played. A great team spirit. I wonder if we might meet England in the competition at some time. I fear for them if we do.
Looks like the Welsh cry over fucking anything
If wales didnt decide to park the bus after scoring this match would have ended differently.
Biggest shocking shocks, that's also not much of a shock is Turkey's performances thus far.   They looked so promising going into the competition, but have capitulated.
If I could watch England play with the passion and heart that Wales showed today I’d be a happy man. I thought they’d regret the missed chances but they held out so well. Great performance.
Ramsey played well - always made good runs. He can run for days. And scored with his signature run from deep. Lampard-esque.
Scotland ATM 😑😭😭
Honestly robbie savage is one of the worst co-commentators i have ever heard.
'Turkey is favoured to win' well I'm not too sure about that...
Rumour has it bales penalty has just come back down
great result pity we have to have that twat Liniker to spoil it
Another class performance from James and obviously Bale was unreal at times. Moore didn’t look like he was having fun mind.
HAHA YES!!! CYMRU AM BRYTH!!
Wales without bale is basically Luxembourg
Great to see the win. Just thinking that penalty miss could yet be decisive if it comes to goal difference. And Ramsey's skied chance, too.
Shut up robbie savage lmao
Well done Wales you've  done it again thoroughly  deserved win from an Englishman
As a Scott I am so proud of Wales, they fought hard against some nasty and spiteful; opposition.
Im not sure what happened with that penalty hes usually good at penalties i hope he gets another penalty or good goal to really show his class. Good two assists
Brilliant 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿.. great to see and fully deserved 👍
Ramsey is key for Wales
Love and support for Wales from England :)
Them deliveries from bale !!🔥🔥
Ramsey should of had at least a hattrick
Turkey 🇹🇷 is OVERRATED simple!
Lol these highlights are madddd
Turkey is becoming a very overrated team.
Excellent from Wales. Should have scored more.
I’ve never heard a more biased commentator than Robbie savage
How much a week and can't hit the target what a disgrace
Bye turkey! it was a joy to have u in the euros
England supporter here and if we somehow end up drawing Wales I'm bricking it honestly
Two filthy assist from bale and neither scores celebrated with him.. that run from Ramsey is definitely from the training ground, simple yet effect, bale gets it, Ramsey take the run
Well done Wales,and to Connor Roberts,Swansea boy doing good
Up the Welsh! I’m mainly English but I’m part welsh so if Wales and England play each other I won’t know who to support, but for now I want them to do well.
Gareth Wales
Absolutely deserved
As a Welshman I was so nervous until we scored the second goal and that wrapped it up and I have no idea how bale missed that penalty.
Ramboo ❤️🔴⚪️🔴
1:27 was every celebrity's worst nightmare.
Real Madrid to Juventus 😂😂😂 commentary clown
I remember hearing a coach (can't remember who) saying if a player is fouled in the box, they shouldn't take the penalty as they might not be in the right frame of mind.
Everytime bale has touch they say it's brilliance fucking stupid commentators he misses a penalty  that's pure brilliance
Ramsey should retire after this game
Good win for Australia. I knew they were in Eurovision but didn't realise they were allowed in the Euros as well.
Watching this on mute so don’t have to listen to Robbie Savage
WAIT STOP✝️IT IS NOT TO LATE TO TURN TO GOD BUT SOON IT WILL BE✝️YOU ARE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW REPENT AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL AND PRAY✝️
Bale could of had 4 assists and a goal but no
bale and ramsey are looking like a naughty duo
Welsh done us proud
Turkey are clowns
The sad part is, we English are rooting for the other british clubs to do well cheering them on, but when we play they want us to fail 😔 Congrats to Wales nevertheless 👏
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿come on wales
Come on wales we win
Ramsey: 😱
Beating the British isnt for everyone 🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧🥂
Turkey have been so underwhelming this euros. Have some decent players in the squad but have absolutely no chemistry. On paper wales should be bottom but fair play to them.
3:02 someone shout off side? lol
Get in Wales. Devon lad but brothers both live in Wales.
Bale has been taking notes from Chunks 😂
Wales, you were independent today. Love You. I assume the referee was Kurdistani LOL that's why they were defeated.
Turkeys defence was really good today especially soyuncu but I think at the end they pretty much knew it was over and couldn't be bothered to try😂 if only they had attackers who could finish
Turkey are the WORST side there. Best they change their name.
Turkey EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS YOU WILL NEVER SING THAT ! 😂🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🏆
Huge win for Wales, im happy for them.
Can we start a petition to never have Robbie Savage on any sort of commentary ever again? Mans a fucking joke
Congratulations to Evian! Their stock just went up by four billion thanks to Ronaldo!
🇹🇷 what’s happening to these team?
What a performance!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿❤️
Bales balls were naughty all game
Well done Wales 👍
Bale was just practising his golfing with that pen and then he decided to turn up
The first time since 2000 that a penalty has missed the goal completely!! That was by Raul for Spain.
Great game! So many shots 😆 Well done Wales 👏👏👏
From England fair play to Wales beating this solid team "dark horses" they once said
What is even more sweet about this, is the fact that Ryan Giggs has played no part in the teams success.
England Win  Wales Win And Scotland are waiting at the airport home 😂😂😂
Brilliant Bale
I love how when connor roberts scored he ran one way and bale ran the other lol
I’m so stupid I thought the title said Ramsay scored Roberto Carlos esk goal so the whole timing I was waiting for that 🤣🤣😭😭
Absolutely fantastic well done to all the players! 👏 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Bale rolling back the years 🔥
Wales. Golf. Madrid. Penalty MISS!
Beautiful driver swing by Bale on the penalty spot there. That's definitely a hole in one.
Good win for Wales, shame about the penalty though!
WALES♥️💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Turkey has left the group
Was the last goal offside? Don't always understand the rules. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Bale playing a blinder other than the pen!
Well done Wales. Looked a class above Turkey today.
So happy for Wales and at the same time expected so much more from Turkey today and against Italy. Fatih Terim would have got so much more out of this team.
Dark horses they said 😂😂😂
Crucial win that for wales with Italy next
Best wales win in 5 years
Simone zaza - 2016 Bale -2021 Nice to see the iss in space getting its traditional euro ball
I got first. Comment
Bale’s two assists were quality! Shame about the penalty though! 😄😮‍💨
First 1 omg
Hi
