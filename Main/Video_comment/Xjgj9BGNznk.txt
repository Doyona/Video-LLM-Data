Mental rehearsal (visualisation) for goalkeepers. https://youtu.be/1Rzot67NXuk
Joe heart make good save he win golden save 2011 2012
ALL LIVES MATTER,
would love to do that with them feel like I could hold my own
Kids used to look up to him
Hey goalkeepers I just posted my first video can you help thank in advance
Alfie Whiteman looks like Marvin Hitz and Yan Sommer literally looked all the same
I'd like to see him playing
Good job joe hart
Why do u need 5 Goalkeepers? Gazzaniga is already good enough
Super les gars je vous aime sûr tout mon idole Hugo Lloris
come on you spurs sorry i soport livipool the reds
Need a stronger back up for Hugo, don't trust any of the others although haven't seen much of Whitehead.
I was thinking who is that goalkeeper wit tht much long hair N suddenly I realized that it was Gazzaniga 🤣🤣🤣
GOOD SPEEDERMAN KEAPEERS
Happy to see joe hart in Tottenham because he is an world class goalkeeper
Cho anh j.hart ra sân với đừng để a dự bị nữa cho ảnh ra sân để lấy lại phong độ đi ☺☺ fan Joe Hart 🥰🥰
I hardly saw anybody criticize him before Pep came to City. He literally changed everybody's opinions on Hart and that drops Hart's confidence. Hence, he's never been the same after that. Even Southgate decided to ditch Hart and choose freaking Pickford. If you think Pickford is any better than Hart well you're deadly wrong.
Is that zayn?
Come on guys I'm always supporting you and especially jose mourinho
Gazzaniga.♡
would want to watch live for 2 hrs for this traing  spus shuld give stuff away
I want to give him as many fucking balls as he wants.
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful....
조하트 겁나 멋있다...
Honestly are people that fucking stupid saying he's good ect ect he's absolute shite thats clear to see! People that think hes good are the ones that know nothing about football!

1:43 beauty one that
Goodluck joe

Enteng banget kaya nya tu bola

Joe looks like he is in better shape too.
Who else loves the sound of the balls when they catch them.
Always a Blue Joe
Who's excited to see Joe Hart in action once again
These Tottenham gks are good Just dont give them any alcohol or anything that can hurt them mentally or physically and yall can win a trophy in about 2 months of a remodel
So happy for the guy💙gave us so much at city, plz be good with him💙
Lost all respect for him. He's chose to sit on the bench as 3rd choice keeper and rake the cash in. He could of easily been a first choice keeper for a lower prem side or high championship and proved himself once again. Waster.
Good to see joe hart in top club again💪
Good work 👍😈💪
1:45 what a save
LOL congrats u guys have 3 "good" goalkeepers looooooooool i can't wait to see totteham on 10th place next season
This is such a shit club with modest supporters that they re commenting on a 3rd choice goalkeeper that wasnt first choice at relegation fighting clubs 😂😂😂😂  Soon you will be saying jose out and get excited about pierre hojbjerg and the europa league hahaha
Idiots in comments really wasting their breath on a 3rd choice goalkeeper that wont feature once in the legaue or in the champions legaue...oh wait
why spurs take jo hurt?
I thought this was an old video. I don't support Tottenham but I'm glad something good is happening to Joe Hart after a long while. Buzzing!
Your camera man could have done his work better (0:00 etc.).
Great to see Joe Hart at Spurs - he's a proper professional and leader to have in the team and on pitch.
Hart’s life will return when he is a at Spurs
What do you think Tottenham?  Shit  Shit  is Tottenham
Joe heart 🤩
Харт, конечно, всегда будет хорошо, но лучше бы левого защитника взяли. Да любого защитника. У которого будет желание играть
So he found a club 😂😂♥️
Glad Jose brought in Joe Hart he is a good keeper and decent guy. Man city and pep did him dirty.
Hit it low to his left lads
not a Tottenham fan but I REALLY hope he plays
I am a arsenal fan
3rd choice keeper? Da dude couldnt even break into the first team at burnley.
wait did tottenham buy him
Love joe hart from the citizens
Even if you receive a cheap weekly wage I want to go to Tottenham Minjae Kim Minjae Kim likes Tottenham Minjae Kim wants to transfer to Tottenham
I doubt he will add any trophies to the cabinet XD (Not like there are any anyway)
Cambodia like 11
Why would you sign joe hart your goalkeepers are bad enough
GOOD JOE HART
Our Keepers👌♥️
Who’s the second goalkeeper now?
I’m Lowkey a Arsenal fan but I’m watching this because joe hart is such a great keeper
It's very interesting seeing these training videos
Spurs YouTube : ok guys this is how we trained our keepers United : we dont do that here
Lloris so scared
Anyone know what the drill from 0:10 to 0:24 does? As a goalkeeper I’ve never seen this before and interested what it works on
No hate but is Joe Hart that good anyway nowadays? He is still decent but for top 6 club no
Joe Hart and Hugo Lloris the world class goalkeepers can even win the Premier League and mock Leicester City
Dodgeball and beer?
0:08 is that Alphonso Areola???
Joe Hart fighsting
골키퍼도 풍년일세 ㅋ  수비는 개판인데  다이어  좀글타 ㅡㅡ  수비 보강가야해 윙백도  보강해야해
Ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
Tottenham hotspurs is noob, 0 trophy champions and 0 trophy premier league, amateur club
Joe hart🤍
IM KOREA
GOOD
Joe hart uno 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣London stays red
조하트 토트넘오냐?ㄷㄷㄷ
I never thought of seeing hart in good club again 😎👊
And fair play choosing Spurs
It was a move I have to say I didn't see coming Joe Hart joining Spurs as A free Agent to be honest, but now to back to a decent sized club who Spurs are even if they haven't collected Silverware but in the Top 4, Top Six club in the League, After its not gone too easy for him at Burnley that's its a surprise move to join Spurs so who knows how he can do but best luck and coming from a Liverpool Supporter
12 years at Manchester city Now Tottenham What a player
He needs some training
Manchester City FC betrayed Joe Hart
When did this happen 🤣
WTF, how many keepers do they want?
This is great to look at... always liked watching goalkeepers at work.
Can't forgive Guardiola for what he did to Hart. He was a City Legend. He came in and replaced him with CLAUDIO BRAVO of all keepers. Who was always going to be a worse shotstopper. He completely ruined Hart mentally and yet till this day, hasn't been able to win man city the one trophy that eluded them. The champions League. Despite outspending the whole of Europe at the time. Yet he's still worshipped. He can never achieve what Lampard did with the academy boys at Chelsea nor what Klopp did with Liverpool. They were some 20 points off Liverpool despite having a 50 million plus RB on the bench. Got outwitted by his former assistant in the FA Cup. What a fraud.  Now Look where Hart has landed. Lost his place in England to the comical Pickford. I wish him the best at Spurs. He will always be bigger than pep will ever be at city. True Legend.
Areola?
mans won more than you're club's history
Come on you spurs we can do even better next season.
For me Joe is better than gazzinega for sure.
The sound is satisfying
Joe deserves more respect
muy buenos arqueros para un solo equipo,demasiado
The audio is giving me vietnam flashbacks
Christian Eriksen the 1st player to loose 2 European finals in 2 seasons they say u can take the man out of Tottenham but u cant take Tottenham out of the man        Pls subscribe it wont do anything but i would appreciate it a lot pls tnx in advance of the subscription
Very happy to see Joe Hart looking sharp. I like Pep but Joe Hart was treated badly. Also he was always better than Bravo so never understood that one.
Two of my favorite goalie from england and france is at same team. Woah..
Tottenham suck
Just here to see the mistakes Hart will make :) edit: or will he redeem himself?

Welcome For Spurs Jojo Hart
ALACAĞINIZ OYUNCUYU SİKEYİM
I'm very happy for Joe Hart. He deserves to end his career at a big club.
Where’s your trophies fc
Hope he enjoys his time on the bench
토트넘에 키퍼가 저렇게 많았구나
My boy
에고......... 하트형 많이 늙었네 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
He's better than pickford
Good to see joe smiling
Best keeper I've seen at Birmingham. Hopefully he finishes his career strong.
Joe Hart is a Legend
Idk why, but whenever I see hart it reminds me of Andrea Pirlo's magic.
5 goalkeeper, really?
I don't really see why they need him. I wonder if they are going to sell Gazzaniga for a big fee?
This guy couldnt even catch Corona if he tried
Joe can be england st choice keeper again,he has the ability n ptential
Happy for Hart. But spurs still suck.😂✌
Keep faith in the special one.... He will win u trophies
만시니 !! 보고있나 !!
Spurs will still win nothing next season 😂😂😂
Noone will ever understand why Spurs brought in Joe (Karius) Hart... Is he related to Jose?  Did Jose buy his house?
He is going to screw up in both Fa cup and league cup and will concede more than 100 goals
The second training session i ever seen for totehmam after the mourinho one
gazzaniga！🔥
Looks like Billy Herrington to me
In this comment section most of the pple r shocked about Joe Hart cming at Tottenham me i was shocked wen i see Gazzaniga wit his long hair😂🤣😂
It was impressive how Joe Hart snatched the ball with his long limbs
Wow
As a Man U fan wanna see him back at his prime
Keep training blood, u better not f### up...
Definitley not a spurs fan, but really want to see him succeed
Complete flop, waste of wages 🙈
Spurs shirt suits him tbf, hope he'll be good for us
Honestly just nice to see the guy enjoying himself. I can imagine he's had it tough in terms of mental health these last few years so honestly hope he finds his place at Spurs.   Whether that be starting or not, just to feel wanted and valued is massive.
Is this continues..Jose is going to assemble a winning squad!! Tottenham assemble!
Hart look happy and relaxed..glad to see him back at a top club where he belongs...
I love Gazzaniga
Leyend  <3

Hey heeeeeeeeeeeey! Give me the foking Ball😂
Please Tottenham, sign Coutinho , James Rodriguez and Bale. To strengthen the club very well. #I love Tottenham
https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg
I LOVE JOHAST FROM THAILAND
With what i see from the training i could describe him in 3 style Athletic  Reflex Handling
The balls sound like bubble wrap which is being popped
Nice video! Hugo lloris and Joe Hart, keep up the good work
I'd love to see Joe Hart do a Tony Parks and win us the Europa,best of luck Joe!
Good luck for Joe Hart,from man city fans..
He looks so happy to be there!
sonny~~~
The sounds not matched
Joe hart will make spurs hot!
I don’t get the point of buying Joe Hart bc he’s just going to be on the bench..
He looks good with a Tottenham jersey on
Am I the only one who questioned why Hart looked like Captain  America
Gazaniga?...
This is the best possible job for Hart, IMO. If you’re gonna be a backup might as well be to the World Cup winning captain
Well, at least you have bought one of the best keepers in the world!... oh wait now
too bad that JOE didn't get a chance to play at White HART Lane stadium...😄 Gazzaniga look very stable by the way🔥
He is 3rd choice goalkeeper?
Sign, cb, rb, lb
Hơ hơ
Best of luck Joe I hope things work out for you.
What a shocked!!!
yo can the league start already
Joe Hart = Over rated and TRASH
He is my hero
I see only one keeper who won the league
Love Joe Hart
Gonna be a Lot of competition,Lloris,Hart,even Gazzaniga is not bad.Injury gonna put someone a first choice GK
I had no clue that joe hart signed for spurs
Gazzaniga such good looking guy
Glad seeing him back
One of the epl legends if you agree like.
I could watch this all day
Chelsea fan here but also Jose fan.  I just feel like Jose is building that locker room to have intensity and drive.  If he brings bale in, its going to be insane
Fair play to hart of your gonna be be a second/third choice keeper you might aswell be it at a top 6 club instead of Burnley
We can do a lot worse than experienced Joe Hart on a free
Great to see Joe back in training and holding his own! There’s always the usual bandwagon jumpers who have to slag him off, pathetic really. Would like to see them do better. While it’s difficult to see him toppling Lloris it would be great to see him getting some game time.
힘은 여전히 좋긴한데 요리스보다는 하체랑 코어 중심이 높네요.. 전성기에 비해 측면으로 다이빙 하는게 상당히 더뎌짐 ㅠㅠ
Best thing that's happened to u this decade other than the other thing u were close to winning was the champions league and the Premier league u bottle
He weren't even that bad at whufc.   Not a bad signing by spurs scum
I did wonder after all these years when he would start training 👍
I’m an arsenal fan and I can see that hart is egar to get back on the field and get back to his prime
Joe Hart would be happy at Tottenham and I feel bad for Joe Hart when Pep arrived to Manchester City and ruined Joe Hart's Career and I hope Joe Hart plays good again COYS
Joe hart isn't good enough for the 3rd tier team let alone spurs hes a has been
Nothing beats seeing your biggest idol smiling again after so long🥺
Joe will comeback stronger
Sooner Joe wick
Joe Hart train any **** worst goalie on the planet!!!! Nae dandruff though!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine prime hart comes back... the league ain’t ready 😳😳
I hope joey all the best hopefully get him back to international’s strong and the right age for it ... well maybe
We’re gonna win the league
Amazing to see Joe Hart in action. I hope he can do a well job in the Spurs with Hugo as goalkeepers
Come on spurs
Why Vorm left?
Hope to see Joe Hart in form again  Blues forever
u can see the difference between the first keeper the bench keeper and the reserve keeper
Thank the Gods joe has left Burnley worst keeper on the planet even a netball ball team would have him on the bench
Mourinho can def revitalize Joe's career
Arsenal fan here, fair play to spurs for giving him a chance, hope it works well for him.
I don’t understand why people criticize him so much. When he was with Burnley he played very well during the first half of the season but the rest of the team were underperforming so the manager made a few changes and brought Heaton in to hopefully increase the chemistry between the players since Heaton was the captain. When Joe asked the manager about why he had been dropped, the manager said that it wasn’t because Joe was playing badly and that he needed to try this one change for the team. During Hart’s second season at Burnley he was benched by Nick Pope who was arguably the best keeper in the league and had the most clean sheets behind Ederson. Even during his loan spells with Torino and West Ham he played well. I mean just look up some of his more recent match footage. He has some highlights on his Instagram. He’s become decent with the ball at his feet too after Pep sacked him. Hart also has a great attitude and mentality. Many of the keepers he’s worked with in the past have rated him for how much advice and help he gives. Joe Hart will definitely not settle for third choice though based on what he’s been saying on his podcasts/show.
Two premier league greats, Lloris and Hart😍
Dear Troller. Please allow me to speak to you in English. Would that be ok? Let's make it articulate. Can you manage that?  The comment was about goalkeeping. I respect Salah but I suspect he may not be so great in goal.  You have nothing to contribute but criticism - fair enough. But remember that your beloved club was languishing until now and every dog has it's day - Liverpool dearly wanted to go back to glory. Do not gloat because the fall soon comes and you (personally) will slime into the shell from whence you came, where we never will hear from you.   Fortunately, there are are enough respectful Liverpool supporters who realise what you are . Dumb as a brick!
Amazing signing, its great to know that we wont be screwed if paulo or Hugo leaves or retire . *phew*
Is this to meet the English quota?
I want Joe embrace his best qualities as goalkeeper. Be an excellent shot stopper and give good spread of long range passes during matches.
Guys, remember Ibra words: „Pep - Shot person  that has no nuts!“
Proud to have him with us. He will be a great asset to us in the dressing room and the training ground. Brings his experience and leadership qualities with him.
https://youtu.be/2ox6Rw26uMk
COYS! 🔵⚪️🔵⚪️
Glad to have Joe with us. Also, how lucky are Alfie and Brandon to be able to train with and learn from those guys? Both look pretty good, Alfie has some quick feet too..Not as quick as Hugo though..
Chelsea should have signed him as a backup keeper instead of willy
More like gazzaniga will have good talk in bench with Joe hart.
🤩🤩
Where is Gazzaniga?
Doesn’t Alfie Whiteman kind of look that yann sommer
Looool,awful signing
GIMME THE FOOKIN BOL
What a signing!! Hope he will refresh and be more strong
Brandon Austin Alfie Whiteman Joshua Oluwayemi Kacper Kurylowicz Jonathan De Bie Isak Solberg  There are some crazy Academy goalkeeping prospects at the club, I just hope they are not farmed off like the recent selection of young players were.
With all these decent signings, we are making a quick and good start. We just need at least 5 more signings especially the defence. Something like Max Aarons, Kim-Min Jae or Zeki Celik
Imagine ruining your career here 😂
Very good and fast movement 2:00
Wow
You know joes got a picture of pep up in his house somewhere and he just sips whiskey throwing darts at it
I think we should split, like Joe Hart playing the FA Cup, paulo playing europa league, and Hugo playing the Premier League.
The look Hugo lloris gave is a look for man who will be second choice for a long time to come.
Hey! Gimme the fking ball!! 😂😂😂
5% OFF iHerb Promo code AJU4240  For all orders!!!
Welcome Joe, Looking sharp!
That young goalkeeper should get a chance , he is actually sick
I just miss the intensity he played with, screaming at the ball boy give me the fu**ing ball.. choose to play in goal because of this man
goodlcuk hart!
Hart was one of my childhood heroes, even though he is at Spurs I wish him all the best and that he can be back at his best soon
will he be first choice cos gazzaniga is actually good
Joe Hart... the biggest goalkeeping shit ever to play for England. I can't believe we have this horrible keeper. Hugo is the man, Gazza is not good enogh to be his backup, but Hart? No way!!
Best goalkeepers young to old in the Premier league
He seems happy... I rlly want to see him at his prime, one of the best
Joe Hart 👍👍👍
Why are you buy him he is nothing at all!!!his old to!!
sore ain't second clock date mouth years V-good luck🙏
I am Gk, seeing this is really good because we do it on our trainings.
Honestly I trust hart in goal before loris
1:54 하나더 ㅋㅋ
Mpurinho sure likes strong characters in his dressing room.
I like that he seems genuinely happy to be there
Joe Hart on training ground be like: Give me the fooking ball FFS
HUGO IS STILL MY GUY . I LOVE HIM 😍
I went to the new stadium yesterday and Tottenham Hotspur stadium is the best
Why 1 team need 3 keepers
lloris is still the best
조 하트가 어디소속이였고 얼마나 잘함??
I wonder which keeper will start v Ipswich
You love to see it 😍
They should show more goalkeeper videos
I do not owe anybody anything now with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Ahahahahaha
Joe Hart will become the second gk
조하트는 훈련받을때 즐거운가보다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 웃넹 ㅋㅋ
Hahahahahha imagine signing joe hart 😂😂😂
Who is the 5th keeper?  2:04
Gazzaniga is my man crush
I like how their trainer is motivating the gk. Like good Joe. and Tres bien to Lloris. Which is very good in French I guess
Imagine watching a video of goalkeepers training. Mourinho effect
한국사람
My fav goalkeeper, Hart and second fav gk, Lloris together. What a day!
I am happy now.when Pep came to  city to he chose bravo over hart and ruined his career at city sending him out to westham united on loan 😡😡😡😡 our first choice goalkeeper ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️ at least Jose Mourinho have commonsense.He is really happy 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Where is gazzaniga?
He’s had a tough few years and it’s easy to forget how good he was. He still got it
Joe Hart + Hugo Lloris in Tottenham is equivalent to De Gea + Sergio Romero in Manchester United 😍😍
Ohh! The Magnificent Joe Hart 💖 . Whatta legend!
Alfie Whiteman seems to be a lot more involved and agile. Send him out on loan
I am a mn u fan but in London spurs is my favourite dont care if they havent won a real trophie since a lot of time
심장이형님 안녕
it kinda sound like peashooters shooting peas to zombies in PVZ
Is it me or the sound of the ball when it hittes the hand of someone it’s like satisfying?
Prime Hart: Had the most clean  sheets in the Prem for a few seasons won 2 Prems and was England’s 1st choice GK
Is the bottom left side shot still a problem for him?
*Click HERE*👇 Proofs or Not* 👇🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/q8Ih8S5WGw0 https://youtu.be/q8Ih8S5WGw0
한국댓이 없네..
Look how Lloris's technique is miles ahead of the rest. Can keep for us for another 5 years easily!! My captain ❤️
Brandon and Alfie have the TOP tutors now!  Wish them learn as much
Dachte Zlatan hätte seine Karriere beendet? :D
5 goalkeepers? Thats gonna motivate each other to get better....
That's right Joe, positivity. I've always admired you as a football player.
Wanna see more of Joe training and playing
I’m an Arsenal fan and I swear down next seasons North London derby is gonna be so entertaining!!!!! 🙌🏾

#COYS JOE HART From Indonesia @rusdycola
1:42 WOW
I no longer need my 9-5 thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
"give me a ***** ball"  Joe Hart
I quit my work with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Looks a bit lazy on his feet.
Very good group of keepers. I could see Hart overtake Gazzaniga whether we sell him or not. Working with Mourinho may revive his career a little bit
I know I love the Hotspurs but I'm really new to soccer still and trying my best to learn who some of these players are on the roster.
I am handsome BUT Paulo look more handsome than me. That hairstyle 👌👌👌
Hugo's agile like a French cat with a blank expression... class! One of the best in our history.....it would have mad seeing  him pissy drunk  driving through London😂...still a G in my books.
He looks happy
Hugo is France Captain who's won World Cup, we also have Hurricane as England capt, Heung Min Son as South Korean Capt, Eric Dier twice as englang capt...so I theres no reason Joe hart unhappy in spurs way...
1:43 decent save from hart. Quick reaction. 👌
0:32 he looks like joao felix though
We want RB,LB
Good to see he is making progress hopefully he will be one of the best again
Fat Neek trains with a couple of drunk drivers and South Korean war lord
Why so many keeper?
I did a double take at 0:30 I thought we signed Yann Sommer
Ngl....hugo is looking stressed ... no1 spot up for grabs..always liked JH..👏🏾
I can see their solemn looks from their faces. I look forward to working with you. Jo Hart player^^
He seems very happy here.
Bench warmer am afraid. Slightly disappointed
꽁지머리 가자니가
Joe didn’t acc look to bad but nothing compared to the sharpness of lloris
Joe(33), Hugo(34)
French national team goalkeeper and English national team keeper in a same team! dang!
Can't keep a smile off his face. Hope he can recapture his form with us.
name a better trio keepers than spurs right now👀🔥🔥🔥
Pls help and possibly save his life with the platform you have .Kyle 8 year old Kyle was Diagnosed with dipg an aggressive form of brain cancer in September. save his life possibly by donating to the go fund me on Kyle https://www.gofundme.com/f/kyles-race-against-time
Llois is really handsome😍
Man City LEGEND ;;; And World Class HUGO LlORIS...;; OH MY GOSH;;; Just Wow!!!
I feel kind of bad for Gazza because he might have a little decrease in his limited play time, but he’s proven himself while Hugo was injured. Could be disappointing for Gazza but for everyone else, we are happy with the best goalkeeper line up in the league. Chelsea, United, are having some hard time with GKs but relieved we won’t have any for at least 2-3 years.
That black keeper is good
Barcelona 2-8 Bayern Munich

Im a city fan but joe hart is now in a retirement home
Recently Tottenham have those players in the team that you just really like. I ain't a tottenham supporter/fan...but I'm liking the team. Been liking the team for a while 🤗.
1:01 how considerate of the spurs HQ to keep a few cars so close by in case Lloris needs to do a bit more drink driving on his break!
Alfie Whiteman is 4th or 5th choice ?
Finally he’s left Burnley we needed to get rid of him
Give me the fu**ing ball !😬!😬!
Brandon Austin looks pretty slick with his movements. I bet you guys didn't notice because your eyes were on Joe Hart
Joe ❤️
What an idiot. He could have signed for, ANY championship team but instead chose to be 4th choice at Spurs. Should tell you everything you need to know about the man.
Did Joe Hart get blackout drunk and wake up with them arm tattoos the next morning? absolutely horrible 😂
he looks like a really want to be in the 1st team and he looks like he is working really hard good to see
Banter club
Lloris is that bad that you had to sign Hart 😂 even Martinez is better than your goalkeepers COYG
Joe hart song he flopped at burnley made spurs better and flopped again the end
Yes joe never give up
I like hart, and feel bad for him but this move is stupid he’s not going to get first team football that he wants, you can see him trying really hard In this short video. Should have gone to a Sheffield United or lower end table and guarantee your first team spot
The new prem balls sound like a brick
I'd give him the fucking ball any day :')
시즌끝낫는데 아직도 저옷을 입고있냐
Next player sign Mauto Icardi Please
Chelsea: sign ziyech and Werner Man City: sign Torres and ake Spurs: sign hojberg and hart
I really hope he plays a decent amount of games for Spurs because I’m a city fan and he deserves to be played because he hasn’t been at a top club, where he belongs, for a few years now and he is a solid keeper if his confidence is up ❤️💪🔥
Stand up if you love Joe Hart
pep wanted a goalie that was good with his feet which is why he uses ederson than any other goalie but i think hart is the better goalie than ederson at making saves but ederson is just better with his feet
The trainer's kicking the predicted same way, so ofcourse the GK going to save it. Should do random shots directions. Hoping for a trophy next season!
Haha
Looking very competitive, but the number 1 is Hugo.
Joe hart looks like a world class goalkeeper again
Was anyone watching gazzaniga? Brilliant 👌🏻👌🏻
I expect 💯 clean sheets with this squad of keepers. COYS!
Joe Hart may not have been world class in recent years but I’m looking forward to him pushing Paulo coz I think he’s been too comfortable in the number 2 role.
Was the other two Alfie Nd Brandon
honestly couldnt find a better replacement for Vorm in a million years, welcome to Spurs, Joe! <3
HEEEEEEEYYYY!! HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYY!! GIMMEDAFFUKENBOWLLLLLL
Alright! Very good! 🇬🇧🇧🇷
Goal keeper is the easiest position there is and it’s mostly luck too that makes you the best
Even now hes still pretty good
Really happy for Joe. I hope he wil get back to his best again!
Great to see my former student, Alfie Whiteman, training with the lads.
Not the signing that us fans wanted, but the signing that the team needed
The chance should be given more to Kazanega, as he is Tottenham's best goalkeeper now.
Brandon 🤩
Joe still weak on his left?
Imagine if they thought they were signing Kevin hart for the entertainment
Am i the only person that didnt even know this happend ?🤨🤔
I still am so happy we've got Lloris. When we signed him back in 2012 I couldn't believe it. The fact he has stayed so long with us is really a testament to what kind of person he is. Spurs Legend don't care what anybody says. Best keeper there ever was at Spurs.
Don't worry Joey, you've been treated badly in the past but the Spurs sanctuary will see you right. You deserve it after your England services
Treat our joe well please lads
I feel he got the raw deal the last few years. Like to see him do well.
I think Joe Hart much better than Hugo Lloris?
Hart u idiot on the bench when u could of played for Birmingham city captain u spanna
Looks like spurs are going backwards with the signings they are making,Struggle again this season, Definitely no top 4
Gazza was on fire.. He catch the ball like glue.. Hugo laughing at Joe, he can't even catch the ball, he just punch it
Good luck Joe on your new adventure. From a young Shrewsbury boy
Show us pierre
Wish him all the best! Greetings from Germany
Wtf Joe Hart At Spurs? 😂
this puts a smile on my face, never supported any team he's played for but i respect how good he was
어떻게 셋 다 잘생겼지
Is he with Puma now?
It’s nice to hart at a big club again
Show us pierres training
Very adorable 💞🥀💐
Santíssima Trindade
Good luck Joe mate
im so happy for joe, one of the best gk in the world!!! hope he get more chances to prove from what he is made!
Good lord how handsome are our goalkeepers 😍
Heyyyyyyy heyyyyyyyyy gimmmmee thee fukkkkkiinnnn baall!!!
Wait is loris not gonna be there gk no more? Or is joe hart just a sub
l like the confidence in hart🔥🙏
What number is he
tottenham buy third string goalkeepers and do not use them
Is anyone else’s recommended full of joe hart?
I can see him being a coach in a couple of years
Lloris Gazzaniga Hart Who's the Best
People are so harsh on joe hart hes one of the best ever in England⚽️
Why do I feel he can revive his career at spurd
joe hart the best 1
Jest Gazzaniga i zakustro
Joe hart to spurs???!😍😍😍
Couldn't recognise gazza with the bun for a sec
Nice to see Kranjcar and Vorm's sons training with the goalkeepers
Joe hart can be better than lloris
Welcome to spurs mate
Hart is 3 choice keeper
I hope Joe does really well and can rebuild his career, we all go through rough times.
Kinda weird not to see Vorm
I think Joe Hart is rlly gud even now, I’d like to sell gazzaniga and use joe instead
Sub if u love joehart
Great group of GK’s BUT I feel we will sell Gazzaniga push one of the younger lads into 3rd choice and use the money to spend on an outfield player
1:42 wat a save
Joe a good leader on and off the pitch great signing good luck mate
I think Joe Hart can become a better player at Tottenham
He looks like he can't keep the smile off his face. Seems really happy to be there. I guess even just training at a top 6 club must make you feel pretty special. Where as at a Championship side, he might play every game but would you still get that buzz?
Hojbjerg?
I feel like a proud dad
This year sounds like they can win El #COYS 🤙
Very good video, it's nice for know like training goalkeeper. Sorry my english is very bad. Let's go Spurs
Gazzaniga His face is so sweet.
Coys good to see ya getting better
Hugo lloris is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and I doubt we will be using him very often..
he is my idol i cant believe he is joining please respond spurs
He's told Lorris you are going to sit on the bench
Go joe
This is embarrassing!! I have never seen a team celebrate getting a 3rd or 2nd choice keeper as much!! Fucking joke!!
Excuse me the youn keeper is
What the 4th keeper Austin
Hart is the 3 gk this is so good
We love arsenal
He looks very happy, and he will bring lots of experience and a winning mentality to this team.
He is dead
No matter what club he is in I want to see him at or close to his prime again
gazza hair though
Hope Joe Hart does well coys🥰🙏
Wow, Godzzaniga so Handsome
what happens to gazzaniga?
Hopefully we can get him back to his good days from when he was at city
Joe hart is so cute and handsome for me
Joe Hart because of their age seems slow.
is the other keeper austin or whiteman?
LHG  No, not Late Home Goal      *Hart, Lloris & Gazzaniga*
Let’s get this top comment because Joe Hart.
am the first to watch guys. Are u guys happy for the signing?
Welcome to COYS I hope you have great time in   Totthenham 😄
The goat hart
Hugo lloris, Paulo Gazzaniga and joe hart in 1 team. That should be illegal 🔥
this year looks promising COYS
Tottenham played a really good season
He’s told lloris that he’s not there to warm the bench.
Announce Hugo Contract Extension
With the amount of taps you can hear you could make a song😂
I love spurs iam from iraq
3 good trios of goalkeepers
Tottenham 4 the leagueeee
As everyone else is first I will be second
Coys
I like you cricket I like you football
I am a big fan
He should bring a much positive and greater mentality to the club
Gazzaniga must of went to bellerin’s local barbers.
1st
Joe Hart a legend in the making. Edit: Yes I know he is already a legend but I hope he is legendary for spurs aswell 😋
