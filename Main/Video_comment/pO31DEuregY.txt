Tupac made a song about his gun to his song me and my girlfriend is about his gun
Still, I see no changes, all I see is hate. I can feel the birth pains of a thousand generations passing away. The bitter fate that only enlightened minds can taste. No judge, no court, no case. Just me and you on their dinner plate. Delete, erase, no trace. Eliminated from history's face. No funeral, no plot, no wake. Sooner or later, we're all a corruption and injustice. We'll create an Omega apocalyptic-type earthquake. Open your eyes, open your mind. This is more than music. I spit that reason our leaders died, that MakMillion influence. It's time to rise out of that product-of-our-environment lies. They're playing dirty, so we gotta do more to survive. Strive to fly, let's create all our connections inside. Form an empire, inspire our entire generation to thrive. Cause all I hear is sirens, please stop the violence. Where's our resources, our reparations for our time in? They wonder why we're wilding, cause all they feed us is nonsense. Make us think it's cool to be dumb and incompetent.
Who making this MF a instrumental da g damn?!!!!
Florida Legend No Cap💯💯
Damn he was actually hard smh
No one can make a song about a gun sound so sweat
It’s so crazy he went out almost identical to Tupac… passenger side, only one who died. He referenced pac several times on IG and his tracks… I hope they are somehow alive together in some other dimension.
Dope...... Sad he wont be making anymore music 🎶 rip #KTA

Dang I'm starting miss my first 25 white handle
The problem with theses rappers that you like is they die to young in there carriers so there is no point in getting attached cause especially foolio if you know and follow him from beginning you know it’s just a matter of time it’s a pity that they don’t move out as soon as there getting bigger that’s how it supposed to be you hustle cause you have no choice and you want better for you and your family so the minute you get the opportunity than get out and live life like it suppose to be lived💯
fuck mane why u didnt made on my beat lmao
19k likes  and 0 dislike 💯💯
foolio go in soo hard on this right here, straight up BANGER! He aint like all them goofies who just be usin that *AUTHENTICVIEWS* to go big on YT.. SMH seem like anyone can go viral these days..

It’s good to see a young black man in a committed relationship.. too much these days you see young rappers running around, no jimmy on tagging all these video girls and knocking them up. But based on this song it seems like Foolio has his head on straight, with a good woman by his side.. he’s going to be a great father one day
Yoooooo this creative

Foolio 🔥
💥🔫 🥰
Foolio!
He did this 👏🏾👏🏾
Bro gotta do some push-ups!
Foolio keep dropping hits on "em 💯🦅
have you run out of names? the d%mbest song name ive ever heard
Ecclesiasticus 33:1-5 There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him. A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm. A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle. Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer. The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree.
People are supposed to be afraid of this clown?
Its not possible to hate someone that we love or love someone we hate. Spirituality is made through, loving and confirming and being assertive in that love. We need to love more and hate less. What needs to be hated is spiritual deficit.
bro tryna be carti
Love song for a gun.. 😂😂foolio lol

I thought dis was abt a girl whole time this bout a gun
He look better wit out da wicks
Are you afraid to die?   If so, read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
This nigga wrote a love song to his gun
Foolio a menace and is cool with Adin Ross he got a versatile friends list 😂

Foolio quickly turning into a into big artist
Wake up, Jesus is coming soon! We are all sinners in need of a savior.  Repent and believe the gospel:  Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.  He is the only way to Heaven.  He alone can save you from your sins and eternal torment in hell!  He loves you and doesn't wish that any should perish.  Time is running out; please believe on Jesus.
