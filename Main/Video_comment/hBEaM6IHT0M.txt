5 ball change is like watching changes more then the game.it should be only 10 ball change.
5:31 best shot of the match or maybe the tournament

Once again Tom Curran proves why he is a useless Bowler
Who is Tom Curran?  He is Ishant Sharma, with a bit of batting.
Already destroyed cricket by T20, now want to destroy what is left

Rashid's run-up before bowling is like him saying "Ya Allah wicket"
Wow super six, 6 curran
saqeeb mahmood has got the most handsome face...

Saqib mahmood looks Threatening bowler
"Not getting the middle of the bat but definitely getting the MIDDLE of Harry Brook's FINGERS"

Jason Roy was preparing for batting in India vs England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 test series in 100 💯  That’s y we lost oval invincibles
5:34 Absolutely Pure Class Shot from Tom curran...
(As a team) if you are looking for spinners. Afghanistan is the markert
Went to the game. Atmosphere was insane
This time it's the "Slider" er, you mean Rashid bowled a leg-break that didn't turn.
Opps naraine ....why u pick him🙄

What a worst bowler of this Era, Mr. Tom curran
Respect willey making it a close game with those final 3 balls😂
Roy ❤❤❤
Crowd at headingly is always great to watch...
Tom Curran could be a really good batsman, but his bowling is awful. 82mph full tosses and 67mph short wide deliveries are getting hacked. David Willey is also really poor. England shouldn't pick either for the T20 World Cup.
Tommy's been practicing - 5:31
Slow turning wickets make for poor cricket in any format other than test cricket. The Hundred has been awful to watch on these low/slow decks.
Where Sam Curran
I was there
Good to hear that a spin bowler did well, even if it is just nonsense cricket!
Tom Curran should quit cricket
Dinesh karthik with some great insights in his commentary lmaoooo..
Roy  -started as an opener  -ended as a finisher
Excellent match
Not 1st
