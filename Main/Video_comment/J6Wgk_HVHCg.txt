I like No Time to Die
These reviews are top-notch. I part ways with the critic on this one, however. The film was not very memorable at all, with a weak villain; an absolutely unconvincing relationship between Bond and Swann (she was greatly miscast); and woke nonsense introduced into the plot. It was was just a mediocre Daniel Craig film, a bit better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre but inferior to Skyfall and especially to Casino Royale.
Phoebe Waller Bridge is movie cancer.
It dipped for about 45 mins in the middle but it was a great film overall and Craig was a great Bond.
"My opinion & only my opinion" It was very disappointing.  I find it ironic & bittersweet. They have this Bond married to a younger woman @ least by 20 yrs (old enough to be his daughter)   2nd M, Felix, Blofeld & Bond as they age, they die.  What kind of ageism is that? Why not see how the original author died Ian Flemming of a heart attack at 56. Why not show good guys can die of cancer, dementia, stroke or heart attacks? It's natural causes possibly from a hard life of booze/cigarettes or exposure to toxic chemicals. Everyone doesn't have to die from evil attacks etc.   It's disturbing how age is portrayed.  Why not have Bond realize doesn't have the sharpness to do the job anymore. Why not show when police & agents come to terms with retiring & leaving the job behind. Maybe they're burned-out or unable to put forth the effort needed. It happens in all walks of life/industries (military, medical, aviation, engineering, teaching etc.). Couldn't this particular Bond have walked off into the horizon? Had a child might not live until it's adulthood. Why not have left him alone after this?  Killing off all the original Bond characters that Fleming wrote? Why? There was a reason Fleming's books & characters came to life. They were a part of him & others he knew in his life from his past work. Now? No one's from that life, only making up characters they have no affiliation with.  Not only lost any identity to the original, lost likability also. This last movie was so dour, slow & flat. Humor failed & tanked. The concept was the stupidest & thinnest reason yet had advanced technology using nano techs BORING!   No connection or interest to worry about anyone of them. One can leave people jaded if spend majority of movie on limitless gun fights & similar car chases. It becomes a video game! Pathetic these people (producers, director & writers) don't realize they've bored the audience many are skipping through this? Using a small child to threaten? Okay hit a nerve let's get over next!   Is Bond relevant in this 'woke' world?  Maybe not, but supposedly we are more open & transparent? Nope! If dealing w/ humans, Bond's still relevant. Smarter? More computer tech savvy? Perhaps.  How 'woke' if we treat 'older' people like baggage & unnecessary get killed off unceremoniously? BTW Gates, Bezos, Buffet, Arnault, Musk, Bloomberg, Waltons are they 'young' or over the 30 mark & considered 'old'? What about these producers here? They definitely wouldn't see screen time if actors in their own movies!   A woman playing Bond? Interesting, the thought about having a woman as Bond is laughable. Seriously, this Bond played by Craig has been the longest rather starred in most movies. Here he's married to a woman a lot younger not comparable to him in age. Minute hits 30 mark, will be dropped. Or, if already is, will be hard to stay in role as ages. Remember what's evident in these movies about older women? There're not seen & if gone in a matter of minutes. Ageism at it's best! They're aren't seen & if are, gone quickly. Female Bond dropped in blink of an eye, wouldn't last another movie or so.   A minority Bond such as Indian, Asian or African? Really, UK is as racist as the rest of the world. Especially after experience w/ a demic. That Bond would be in only 'a' movie. Brits don't have Black R&B singers because taken over by cultural appropriation rather see White singers. How's that going to happen with a Black Female Bond?   Will find a way to get rid of that Bond & bring back the White male. Problem? It's no longer the Bond of the author, but a make-believe one w/ new supporting characters. Results so far, killing the franchise with stupid ideas how to repair & revitalize it killing old people. Was a boring, dull & overplayed trope of a movies.
For an alcohol-free hangover experience, watch this movie
Didn't anyone edit this audio? Couldn't be bothered to watch it again, and makes some snips?
Daniel  Craig makes James Bond a legit bad ass , Christian Bale did the same with Batman. Roger Moore and Sean Connery and the other guys in my opinion, can't  even compete with Craig's  James Bond.
A DNA sequenced virus? What it this? FoxDie from Metal Gear Solid? 😂 Just finished the movie btw. Really enjoyed it.
His last words were - she is perfect! A hint? Well, here is the future 007 with the same last name! Why not?
1 Live & Let Die 2 From Russia w Love 3 Diamonds are Forever  4 Goldfinger 5 The Man with the Golden Gun
It's unobtrusive, but when he meets her, he says "James. Call me James."  Why "call me" James?!? What else is there? Jimbo? Jim? Jimmy? It's a very subtle suggestion that "James" is a name he is 'just using,' or is now using after first having used some other name.
I think this one's plot could have been better. It wasn't too bad tho I guess. Also the Daniel Craig's Bond series has been consistently good... Not great but good. Far more consistent than any other Bond era.
Lashana Lynch was a negative, and unnecessary addition to this film. Her entire attitude and demeanor was toxic to Bond and the 60+ year legacy (books and films combined) behind him (Just a number? You couldn’t be more wrong, Daniel Craig) She was unlikable, rude, and it would have saved this film a lot of criticism (most of it, actually) if they’d removed her. She did not make me feel like she was deserving of the title ‘007' (Or any ’00’ title for that matter.) Although, I think having a female in that role is absurd, and not in line with the vibe of the franchise.

How are they supposed to continue after a series like Daniel bond
It’s sad but god dam damgood why to kill a character
One of the worst Bond movies EVER
Will never pay to watch Marxist propaganda. Get woke go broke!
Daniel Craig has said that he would retire from the role of James Bond if he felt he was too old to play the character. Craig has also said that it has become harder to be fit enough for the role and that there has been more use of doubles for action sequences.
Good day JoBlo  Need to ask a question?
I walked out of Casino Royale happy and excited.  I walked out of No Time to Die angry and depressed.  Remember when James Bond actually enjoyed being James Bond?  Remember when James Bond films were...what's the word?  FUN!!!  This wasn't Die Another Day awful, but the script was beyond stupid and a horrible way to end Craig's era.
Bored shitless after I pirated this piece of crap. Just as joyless and dull as I expected. 😂
It was ok. Really long. I did like the ending. Really did give craig a fair send off. I think skyfall is my fav Craig bond. Also the woman from Blade runner "Poloma" in Cuba she was amazing and beautiful. If i didn't love her in bladerunner i love her now. That dress and her kicking ass in it was AWESOME
This guy giving the review must be being paid by the makers of this movie ,it was boring  all the woman were  cold  the bad guy whispering all the time you could not hear what he was saying  it was at least an hour way to long.way the worst bond of all time it just dosn,t work.
You can't paint lipstick on a pig and you can't make a Bond film with only typical action scenes but no real  plot nor evil villain and label it a true Bond movie.   Afterreading the reviews,  seeing the basic elements on YT and sneak peeks, and skimming thru  an overly  long script written by a woman(?) with misogynistic  views clearly exemplifyed by incorporating an empowered female character to mock Craig, I'll think this is a pass.  Craig was not my fav as Bond after his 'Casino' first appearance and managed to live down the Bond legend thereafter.   Looking every bit bloated as well in the role and seconded only to Rami being given a bucket of  fertilizer  as a so called villain, you have to wonder if Barbara Broccoli has succumbed to the female  empowerment rage by studios to castrate all former male fantasy role models!?   Look what happened to poor Luke Skywalker;  a feeble minded, old rag tag hermit atop a solitary mountain before being offed;  and Hans Solo,  pig stuck by his own son and feeble thinking!!   There ya go , my friends, all male role models to the dust heap of history for politically correct intrusions on what was once a deserved male province of fantastic escapism...but no more.     I'll watch tv Bond movies than waste my money on drivel for diversities sake and no other.
Bond fan for 31 years. Just watched this a day ago and I thought Fukunaga did an awesome job with the cinematography and locations (I LOVE how he interweaved more elements from OHMSS, which is my favourite Bond movie of the entire franchise, and also sampled from numerous others); throw in my favourite movie composer ‘the big Hans Zimmer’ to the mix with that epic soundtrack; and the story itself captivated me emotionally towards the end. The believability of Safin and his villains as well as some cringeworthy scenes in the film were the only cons for me. However, it still doesn’t beat Spectre for me (not yet anyways, I’ll have to watch NTTD again) as Spectre explains a lot more about Bond and Blofeld’s relationship and their personal vendetta towards each other which I’ve always wondered about over the years (Blofeld: “I am the author of your pain” and “you interfered in my world, I destroyed yours”, as well as the stunning locations in that movie alone.   My current ranking of Craig’s movies, subject to change: 1.Spectre 2. NTTD 3. Casino Royale 4. Skyfall 5.Quantum Of Shit  So, it’s the end of an era 😭...I would love to see a prequel instalment as to how Bond becomes 007 prior to joining MI6
It ticks all the boxes and blow-for-blow I agree with this review and _yet_ somehow it felt a bit lackluster to me.  Maybe it was the duration or the dull colour palette or the slow-burn emotionality.  I still think it is a fitting way to end a run of movies that are all supposed to be connected in a way the older Bond films never were.  I have to add one more nitpick however - the mcguffin annoyed me because it would be incredibly difficult to successfully develop a genetic technology that could kill one ethnic group while sparing all its many related ethnic groups.  Many of the harshest and most long-term conflicts are between closely related neighbours whose differences are cultural or religious and nanotech cannot target that.
Someone Actually Gets It!!!  Your Stock has gone up in my book Twice This Week!!!
I thought I destroyed this plot line in Sapienza
Man no Time to Die îs so boring, the   15 minutes are good  The rest îs a mess,!
This was not the Bond movie I was waiting for. A shame really, as they squandered half of an excellent Bond movie by connecting it to half of a generic action flick.
surely daniel craig could have got a tighter suit ? perhaps made out of spandex or maybe just body paint  ?
I still think Craig more of a russian agent. Too stiff. Way too old for lea seydeux.. out of place and...why hans.zimmer monopolize all scores the same banging or monotonous same batman computer cuts.
Daniel Craig is the Christian Bale of the Bond Franchise. His Bond films are The Dark Knight Trilogy of the franchise. Craig made Bond, dark, gritty and a believable character again. He brought the franchise back to it's roots. Just like Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan did with the Batman character. Casino Royale is the Bond version of Batman Begins. It gave fresh new life to the Bond Franchise, and brought it back from the goofiness and the over the top galore of Die Another Day. Just like Batman Begins did it after the backlash with Batman & Robin. Craig made the Bond films, dark, believable and realistic again. Also you could say that No Time to Die is the Bond version of The Dark Knight Rises. As Bond sacrifices himself to save the world just like Batman did it in The Dark Knight Rises. Both the Bond and Batman films have had a similar evolution in tone and depiction. By initially starting off as dark and gritty, then becoming camp and over the top. Then becoming dark, grounded, realistic and serious in tone again.
Hans Zimmer is not good. At all. Lol 😆 🤣 😂
Revenge revenge all bond films about...
Killing Bond that way is dreadful, to then also say 'James Bond will return'... fuuuuuck you
It's an awful movie, beautifully shot.
I did not like this film! What a mush-mash of directions, personalities and ideas! Such a “sensitive” Bond! The woketards decided to kill off everything about this toxic male. Homage is paid to previous Bond movies including dialogue, music, sets, cars, sight gags…you name it, it was mentioned. The villain was laughable. Why does whispering make Safin sinister? The only thing missing in this movie are dolphins with lasers strapped to their heads. That would complete the absolute parody of spy movies and James Bond films this is. “Time To Kill A Franchise”
I thought it was an ok bond film.  Better than quantum and spectre, not as good as casino royale, maybe almost as good as skyfall.  The only major issue I had was the villain and his motives (and his story).  I have other nitpicks (seemingly jarring edits that seem to have removed scenes/dialogue, even though the movie is long, for instance), but nothing that completely ruins it.
There is something in action scenes in bond movies compared to all other movies. Here it feels completely real and it actually feels like a close call.
I don't like Craig as bond
I'd put this more at 9/10 or 10/10. Just watched it, loved it so much.
Fair review. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is feminazi cancer though. Everything she spreads her woke ideology to, suffers and dies. Just you wait for Indy 5.
2:03, 3:45 nice edits. 5:46 Moneyponeey? Get a grip guys!
I enjoyed it but roger Moore is still my fav bond
Nanobots not virus
I mean the movie is good, a well-done farewell for Craig. But the story itself...not that outstanding. Lea Seydoux is not that good, especially since her character appears in 2 Bond films, which I consider a privilege. After 4 years, her character did not have any major development, and her back story is a little over-emphasized, and her relationship with Bond is not so strong, even she breakup with Bond half-way in the movie and people don't seem care so much. Rami Malek is a good actor, but the role of Lyutsifer Safin is so tiny, he has nothing to demonstrate his acting. And oh boy, they use Waltz as Blofeld in 2 films, and he is still the biggest waste of good actor in Bond franchise. 8/10 is a little bit overrated, but if you score Quantum of Solace the same score, I think it should be 8.5/10. For me, this movie is 7/10, maybe 7.5 at best; a good film, but not rewatchable.
Was it only three hours? Felt like 3 months or years? Felt like all those times Bond was trapped in a cell…or being tortured on a maniacal spa table getting my spine stretched…..oh the misery!!!!
I just saw No Time to Die here in the states. While I have to commend the film on how well made and acted this film is, this film just felt so out of place. Even with its ending and surprises along the way, I was sitting in the theater thinking of Bonds such as Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Octopussy, License to Kill, Goldeneye, Skyfall and many more and this film felt like it wasn’t even in the same universe as those films. I guess the Game of Thrones/Avengers every ending/plot has to be controversial trend and maybe unexpected trend finally caught up to James Bond…
Do you have an editor? Or anyone who double checks these videos before upload? Swear to god JOBlo has potential but is ruined by terrible voice overs and bad editing. They should all get the WTF happened to this movie treatment.
In my opinion Daniel Craig is not James Bond, he's a normal action character like Jason Bourne, Bond used to be the guy that every guy wanted to be   He fell in love with 2 women and left MI6 twice all in the space of 4 movies....   What kind of James Bond is that..... Could you ever imagine Connery, Moore or Brosnan doing anything like that...   If you want the Bond from the books then watch the Dalton or Craig Bond, he used to be a charismatic suave and sophisticated bebonair with an eye for the ladies who killed the bad guy and saved the world, If you don't have all these qualities then how can you possibly still be James Bond anymore....    Bond isn't an icon for being Joe average gritty secret agent with no humor    Connery set the scene and it was continued through Moore and Brosnan, This is what separated him from all other action movie characters and why every woman wanted him and everyone guy wanted to be him   I love the Bourne movies and have watched them all many times but if Bourne suddenly started chasing the women, developing a sense of humor or began being suave and sophisticated I'd be totally put off the character and that's why I was put off Craig fron the beginning   It's why Moore, Brosnan and Connery were brilliant and Craig is nothing more than a generic action character with a cool name and heritage built on the backs of his predecessors
The theme song was God awful.  The movie was thrilling and entertaining.
Agreed, it was a bit long but I loved it. Need time to digest after a rewatch.
The divisive Spectre? That was possibly the best.
How come you didn’t edit out the slip up at 2:03?
Eh I completely disagree on the Madeline character. To me they have no chemistry and I just don't buy that she is his true love. Vesper is his true love. Unfortunately with how key their relationship is to the plot it leaves me very iffy on the film. A lot of good in this film though.
I hope the producers now understand it's more important to cast an intensely COMMITTED actor, rather than someone who only looks good in a suit. Craig is a great actor who does both and is by far my favorite Bond - GOAT!
I just got back from seeing it and I loved it! That being said, I'm genuinely sad that the era of Craigbond is over :/ My eyes definitely welled up in the end
Yeah, the plot was so convoluted I don't blame you for missing that it was actually nanobots, not a virus. ... Wasn't it? LMAO, that plot was so all over the place, I'm not even sure if I know what I just watched. Glad you liked it. But I'm gonna need some time on this one.
Great review!
Ana De Armas is the most beautiful woman in Hollywood right now and it's not even close. She's perfection and idk wtf Ben Affleck did to mess that up
I couldn't make it to the end of the painfully self-important Spectre.
Loved it. Need a video of the references and easter eggs. I've seen every movie and caught some but someone should make that video.
This was a boring bond movie. Usual in-your-face NWO, eugenics, nanotech-in-DNA propaganda
They knew what was coming. Inside info. Heck the whole padademic . A Drill was ran only 6 months before.
Feebie waller Castrate . What. Mens Lives Matter.
I got the vibe the lashana was a homage to sean connery and ana de armas to roger moore. A spin off with those two would be cool.
Did anyone else notice the missed edit with the double talk at 2:05?
Absolutely loved Ana De Armas in this one... I didn't care for the villain at all though, he's massively underdeveloped. Safin makes sense when he's pursuing his personal vendetta, but once that part of the movie is done he pivots to megalomaniac for no apparent reason, he also makes a bunch of abrupt shifts in his treatment of Madeleine... he's all over the place and simultaneously insignificant. It's a better movie than Spectre and Quantum, but clearly a step down from Casino Royale and Skyfall. I hope the next installment is a little more light-hearted.... despite what this review indicated, the tone is extremely serious except for the 15 minute sequence in Cuba which is easily the best part of the movie. Also, enough with nanobots and "smart blood" already...
“Money Punny”!😆
Really enjoyed the movie.  I totally forgot what happened in Specter and didn't miss it.  Ana De Armas has stolen my heart again.  So beautiful and kicking ass along side Bond makes me chuckle since their last pairing in Knives Out.  Felix knew sending Bond to Cuba would be somethign he would enjoy.  Liked seeing all the support characters more backing Bond instead of just setting him up and off on a mission.  So good as a send off for Craig's Bond.
I just watch the film just yesterday "Friday" and must say a actually liked it.  At the current moment I am doing a James Bond run through my dvd's I am at Goldfinger at present
Plot hole: Madeline was capable of leaving the island on her own. It was both the double o's job to destroy the island. It was poor writing to have nomi taking Madeline to safety, leaving bond to do the job alone.
I simply loved it!  From start to finish. Loved Billie's song. And I definitely loved Ana De Armas  (Blade Runner 2049 and Knives Out) ! She was awesome! 😎😎😎😎❤️❤️❤️😎
Honestly all these "Bond fans" hating on the movie probably didn't even pick up on half of the homages they did.
Great review. By far the most fun Daniel Craig Bond movie. Haters can fuck themselves, (nobody cares that y'all pwn libtards). Wasn't a fan of the way the end was framed, honestly. Wasn't big on the new 007 at first but grew to like her, although I think it's just because she has real a like, John Walker as Cap vibe? Hamfisted into a canonical role and feels like an interloper (but that could be an objective choice)
~Heavy spoilers~🍿 ~Long Read~📖  I think the overall problem with this movie is that they are trying to pick up the pieces left behind from spectre, and none of whats in that movie landed or felt legitimate or earned. I Actually like Lea Seydoux as an actress who played Madeline and was excited that she was the new bond girl in spectre, but the execution of their love story was so contrived so in the end I really didn't care. Even the people who made that movie knows what's wrong with it. Why would they double down on it?   The writing and execution in the first quarter of the this movie was pretty good up to a point but the basis for the characters just weren't there for me.    The concept of bond having a child and the fact that it's a daughter on top of it was actually a genius move as a concept on paper, its kinda like poetic justice for him. The idea that he has to really commit and care and actually be responsible for someone. Having that character be his daughter could have been deeply profound in that way. They could have also addressed his relationship with women through the daughter character. That would be addressing the misogyny and faults 8n his character. Maybe even could address the vesper Lind history that made Bond unable to commit to any real relationships with women because of how his heart was basically ripped out of his chest by Vesper. I'll give Daniel Craig this, he knocked it out of the park with his acting in a few key scenes. He made me really feel like he knows his life has just turned upside down the second he her eyes.  He made me tear up couple times in the film if I'm being honest. Anything with Bond and his daughter made me really feel Bonds angst of her safety being in jeopardy. The daughter aspect, if it was used more and better, it could have been amazing but it's lost under everything else.   Ok...Ana de armas was a total smoke show in this role! Goddamn she was good. Her character was badass, playful and intrigueing and that made her even sexier. I didn't think she could get more attractive but this role definitely did it. She should have been Bonds sidekick throughout the movie and become friends with him instead , moving away from a cliched romance. Maybe there could have been a throughline in the film with him becoming sort of her mentor along the way since he's pretty much the most seasoned agent and she's insecure with how good she is. You can even still have the "saying no" scene later in the movie as their partnership grows and maybe some awkwardness leading to a back and forth conversation. Maybe he tells her about Vesper. Wnatever. Something like that would have felt organic, served as character development for Bond and some more three-dimensional depth to her character. Makes the "saying no" moment maybe actually mean something in the movie rather than a throwaway comedic jab at Bonds character.  LaShawna Lynch was fine. The hate for this movie for her being 007 and ppl just assuming that this is more of her movie than James bonds or she's taking power away from Bond and she's taking over, screw feminism, PC agenda pushing bitches, etc etc... I never subscribed to any of that nonsense. It's almost like people are trained and groomed these days to react like that without ever giving anything a chance....hey wait a minute🤔. I like her as an actress, was looking forward to see her performance. Problem is I never understood her character's initial hostility with Bond, I was like why is she going undercover and manipulating him into bringing her back to his place just to stick it to him and show him up. Could of had the same conversation in a different way maybe in a conventional way, idk doesn't matter. I have a feeling that her character doesn't like Bond for his history of misogyny and filandering, but nothing about him as an agent. So the writers prolly decided they should have her characters main reason for not liking bond to actually be a general critique of men in society??? not cuz she has a grudge against him, or he always sucked at his job, or from some personal altercation with him. That's the type of shoehorning in PC agendas. Give her a real reason not to like Bond and you can still have her give him give him shit about his relationship with women. Also you'd think they would have just started out as platonic competition instead of trying to one up and literary sabotage each other's missions when they both have literally the same goal when the stakes are potentially so high. You think maybe she would look up to bond a little, wouldn't the new agents and recruits look up to bond? Wouldn't they all want to secretly be like him not as a person, but as an agent? Since when is going by the book and putting down your legendary predecessor an interesting character trait. Aren't you supposed to like her by the end of the movie? They didn't give any real scene or event that gets them to respect each other to follow through on squashing the animosity, so what was the whole point. At least Naomi Harris's character didn't have all this nonsense. No newcomer is just going to give a middle finger to the previous guy when he's freaking James Bond, he should be a legend amongst new agents. This whole thing of Bond being out of his time and too old was addressed in Skyfall and spectre so that stuff felt tired. I have no problem with the ideals that were being pushed to be PC and give Bond some growth. The execution is not that good but not as bad as Disney's Star wars. There is a way to do this people, organically, where it doesn't feel like a soapbox.  Side note, felt the action was a bit underwhelming in this movie. It peaked with the scene in the first half with that goon shooting away at Madeline's window in the car and James just letting it happen while he deliberates wether to trust her or not. Great Bond moment and was narratively creative. This whole scene is totally Bond and badass. You believe Bond would be an asshole and do something like that. For the most part though this series has lost its edge especially in the action scenes, starting with some parts of Skyfall and heavily with spectre. They just came across as made to look pretty and expensive and putting more effort into the camera work trying to get everything in one one shots rather than making the action actually exciting. You guys remember the parkour scene leading to the shootout at the embassy in Casino Royale?! Those action scenes have so much edge to them, you feel the danger bond is in. Editing is one of the most important components to action scenes and these just feel like constantly unnecessary long takes. Now we even have parts  where he is just walking right out in the open, firing his gun vaguely in bad guys direction, on a set that probably costed 1/4 of the movies budget. Even holding his gun from the hip at times and still casually just hitting his mark every time. All the while with the bond theme blaring in the background. Did the same thing in spectre at the desert scene. Just seemed like a total waste and honestly a bit lazy. The SUV Chase was ok I guess but it has Bond literally nudging his car into the bad guys cars just once and they go flying in to some convenient obstacle or hit ramp that launches them into a flip. A lot of the action is like this and it comes off as just lazy even though they spend hundreds of millions of dollars making these movies.  All that being said I didn't hate the movie, if you watch it just as a spy drama it's not that bad. I didn't get bored really that much even tho it's almost 3 hrs. So take that for what it's worth. There's annoying bits of comedy and one liners that come off as awkward rather than funny. Always thought that kind of stuff didnt fit for Craig's films. Rami Malek was good, but underrutilized. His characters ultimate goal was not really clearly defined but I think he served the purpose of the movie. Nothing more nothing less. For me I didn't mind bond dieing, and the film for the most part earned it, was done well.   It's certainly better than quantum of solace and spectre. A serviceable end to Daniel Craig's era. Although, I have noticed things about these last 3 films and it makes me think ever since the dark Knight came out, the people behind these films are trying to copy Chris Nolan's aesthetics, and it's gotta stop. But that's a whole nother conversation.  Thanks for reading.
No Time To Die was a disgrace. The whole of the Craig era was bleak, drab and generally unpleasant. This film made retrospectively made them all even worse. Why F bombs in Bond movies? Why? Bond films were unique in that generations of family could sit down and watch a movie together and be entertained. For two hours they could share something, it brought them together. The Craig films, and this one in particular, were designed to be deliberately divisive. Just like The Last Jedi. Average audience members will think No Time To Die is okay.  True, long-time fans will hate it. I hated it.  I took my family, they hated it.  I can’t speak for others in the cinema.  However, I have never seen a theatre empty so quickly and quietly when the titles rolled. No Time To Die was arrogant and disrespectful to the 50 years of history.  Imagine a vase, a family heirloom carefully handed down from generation to generation.  The latest custodians don’t feel the same responsibility, they look at the vase and don’t like the colour, or the shape.  They replace the handle and change the colour.  Every year or so they go back to the vase and make some other change (each time making it more appealing, to their eyes, in the short-term but long-term devaluing it) then one day they decide they don’t like it at all and they smash it on the floor.  That is No Time To Die. As a film No Time To Die is overly long, grim, extremely talky (much of the dialogue was repetitive and derivative), the villain’s plan made no sense.  As an average film it is mediocre.  As a Bond movie it was an utter disgrace. I suspect what will come next will be worse. Avoid this film. James Bond, like Star Wars, and so many other franchises is not for life-long fans anymore, it is for the average viewer. It is not special. The irony is there's a massive audience for the Bond formula. Just look at the success of the Mission Impossible movies. They are doing exactly what Bond used to do and go from strength to strength. James Bond is dead.
Both Lynch and Waller Bridge combined to wreck what could have been a decent movie.  3/10
Thanks man 👍 Love your stuff... CANNOT WAIT TO SEE NO TIME TO DIE. Only 3 more days for me.
They had an opportunity to expand there lore of the double O's and make a great new fresh character, hell could have made her 001 and called her the OG double O... or any thing and showed her creation, heck a new double O movie that is about this new agent could have been great... they could have even had a cammy-o with bond like him talking with Q and gearing up for his next mission. but the way they advertised this movie they just killed all of there money potential, and really im so turned off that im going to add this to a rental, and honestly i might be 5-6 years before i see it, and dont care. Shit the second to last star wars movie fell in to that cat and i only have seen like an hour of it at my nephews birth day party, and the last one ill never see... so, Bond is creeping in to that cat real quick. I hope they can pull it back... but then again im starting to care less and less for companies that shit on there fan base, and crap on there legacies. Im not giving them money or supporting that.
Did anyone else feel like in this film Bond was strangely upbeat and unusually goofy?? I found this sudden character change quite jarring, it felt like a Brosnan film for me
Terrible film..and he dies
Clueless. Craig was supposed to be his own Bond, yet plunders elements personally identifiable to both George Lazenby’s Bond and Timothy Dalton’s Bond. If that wasn’t bad enough they’re given over to a different character. It’s a complete disgrace.
They've given Bond a way out if and when they bring him back from the dead because nobody will watch a Bond movie (cause that's how we refer to them as "007 is only a number") without Bond himself in it and anything else (it can still be a white male) will simply drive the audience figures down.  Bringing in a female as 007 (who can across as obnoxious and did less than the CIA's Paloma), turning Q gay (which will have to be edited out in countries that find that lifestyle wrong) was unnecessary as I have friends who are gay and a close family member who is bisexual who have enjoyed all the other Bond films without any woke agenda needing to be pushed and killing Bond (who has a watch that can destroy the nanobots) soured the film and without these added extras it would have been shorter with a higher percentage of action and less unnecessary nonsense.  It would also have been less insulting to all the other actors who played Bond because Craig's version felt like a stand alone series and to kill him off is disrespectful to them.
But this was absolutely full of spoilers...
Craig will always kick Arse as the most realistic Bond in the spirit of Lazenby and Dalton !
I love y guys but don’t defend this shite! Bond never dies unless it not a Bond Movie! Boooooooooooooo Boooooooooo Booooooooooooo!!!! This movie is total shite!
That's a very kind review.....NTTD makes Quantum of Solace look like Goldfinger. One of the most disappointing Bond films I've ever seen
I thought it was brilliant. The ending was superb. It was slick, brutal, no messing around and all the action was believable and made sense.   It wasn’t woke, it was very self aware and had the right time throughout.   The 2 1/2 hours didn’t drag for me one bit. The best Bond film ever.
HOW BOND 25 ENDs: the Woke ladies escape safe and sound in a boat while they send the MALE to finish the job, kill the bad guy, get shot an bombed. WHAT A JOwoKE  They should have send 007 women to get shot and bombed...to demonstrate equality. What a piece of crap wokeism.
Way way too much cgi. It's just lazy film making. Also,Connery was much better. This guy is too dour.
Rather watch john wick instead
Awful film 3/10
i loved the movie. I nice farewell for Bond and Craig
Don't need another fucking bio weapon virus movie...I been living in one for the last 18 months and I'm fucking SICK TO DEATH OF IT.
I think No Time To Die (2021) will divide a lot of people and most James Bond Fans will absolutely hate it. I personally like it. It wasn't perfect but it was a very good conclusion to the Daniel Craig/James Bond Era and a BIG improvement over Spectre (2015).
Must have been a different no time to die i watched because it was crap and most of the cinema though so at the time
Nobody would ever kill a worldwide acclaimed and beloved character like Superman or Mickey Mouse: it would be absolutely crazy and, to make things much worse, totally unprofitable. Needless to say, such a reckless stunt would look even worse right after almost two years of pandemic-related suffering and misery. Nonetheless, that obnoxious, devilish Broccoli-Wilson duo, made such ill-fated decision during what should have been a most relaxed and pampered lockdown, literally drowning in their multibillionare’s lives. So, they thought it better to get rid once and for all of their very own cash cow.  I found it, therefore, quite useless, on our part, to simply go on trying to “save” a movie which simply shouldn’t exist. Who cares about screenwriting (awful, I agree with all of you), direction (poor, to say the least) and photography (slightly above the average), when 007 already left for good at the end of Spectre? Why pack a premeditated and quite preposterous kill in a medium-quality movie, just to left the audience puzzled, speechless and, most of all, totally unsatisfied?! Maybe those two mischievous movie-makers have got sick of money, but there should have been many other ways to get themselves rid of such a terrible “burden”, without literally butchering their adoring audience worldwide. And, who cares about that very devastating ending being “perfect” for an ill-devised and poorly developed 5-film “series”?!?! 007 has never been a Netflix series or is it going to be?
I've been watching Bond films since my dad took me to watch Goldfinger double billed with Thunderball way back in 1965, therefore I was a staunch fan of Sean Connery as Bond until Daniel Craig made his debut in Casino Royale, which became my No1 Bond favourite. Now, I  had a lot of fears this Bond film was going to be a flop and have commented as much on other reviews on YouTube... Well after going to see No Time To Die with my niece my fears have been squashed and its going to be a very hard act to follow, at almost 3 hours long the film holds your attention all the way through and its a rattling good ride with no woke crap in sight, thank god. While Casino Royale is my favourite Bond film, I think No Time To Die sits level along side it.
Agree with you, I liked it also. Solid Bond-Movie and definitely a worthy Good by for Craig.
"Whoever said that Bond was going to be sidelined in his own film was wrong."  Is it too late to fire the marketing and trailer-making teams?
I think the movie was ok. But to see all the reviews people sucking off hollywood now a days really enoy me. Is this movie just as good as Terminator 1 and 2? Jurassic Park? Goodfellas? Saving Private Ryan? psycho? You name it... How can all films get 8-9-10 out of 10??? It is fucked up.
Barbara Broccoli's father would be disgusted how she's turned this franchise into a PC disaster. Obviously it's time for the franchise to die.
There is no wokeness, unless the pure existence of a black character and the fact he doesn't sleep with every woman he sees is counted as wokeness. All these people judging the film when they haven't even seen it.
Awful, awful film, just so unbelievably terrible, other than that, I’m speechless…
No Time to Die is the worst Bond film yet.
🆗️
Today i watched No time to die..  i left the theatre feeling empty and heartbroken, Jame Bond shouldn't have died and his death felt so out of place with the franchise ... the plost was better for him to retire for good and live the rest of his life happy with his family.. the ending felt forced and i won't even start with the woman 007. the more i kept watching , the more i hated her.
JoBlo...you should have warned me..this was a damn emotional journey 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This movie left me feeling nothing but disappointment and how dare they simply brush off the big finale with nothing more than two scenes at the end. No respect. Hollywoke strikes again.
This review feels lifeless. Like he's just reading someone else's notes
I want a Anna spinoff !!!
The film is complete shit, which can only mean that this channel is shit by extension given that such a basic observation eludes you.
Have to agree Bond is still very much the main attraction in this movie, the entertainment article sites really have shit-stirred with this movie and there was honestly no need for it. Solid last outing as Bond for Craig, not as good as Skyfall or CR but still very good, the ending will divide though.
daniel gave us 2 mid movies 1 pretty damn good and 2 top tier movies. i do love him the best in the role
I love this movie
I'm kind of tired of seeing these 110 pound women beating up 200 pound men that are trained killers.
Spectre was 10 times better than the other two after casino royale.   Straight up couldnt even stay awake during Skyfall
Casino Roysl was a reboot--at the film's start, he's only got ONE kill.
The new 007 is just so unattractive, I can’t even watch it! WTF!
2:02 3:45  Oops
2:02 oops
Metal Gear Bond. Seems like they might have had Loljima (Kojima) on the script. FOX-DIE! I was truly expecting to see a giant bi-pedal robot and Bond to call M Colonel at the end. However I agree the Cuban bar fight was great and the end op was great however I’m still processing the ending.
This film was terrible. They just killed the franchise
I felt that this film owes more to the Mission Impossible films then to On Her Majesty Secret  Service . Especially the second one , with a similar raid on a lab for the virus and a Military bunker as the villain headquarter.  I never like Madalyn and never bought that Bond would leave the Secret Service for her. The best relationship is Bond and the New 007. Wish we got less of Bond and Madalyn and more of Bond and OO7. .
Hey Everyone. The film isn’t political nonsense. But they do kill James Bond because they can’t stand having him around. Thanks for lying to us  JoBlo, you shill.
They need too place Margo robie for a bond girl
And i thought waking up super man was a tall order?
Too many spoilers in the movie summary. what's the matter with you? It's a bond film, we don't need to hear you spoil the plot in such detail. I had no idea that specter was even involved in this movie.
On the other hand, I do love you and your channel. Always great work even with your bias towards Bond.
My one word review of Spectre 2 : Shitsandwich!
This film is sh!t!
"Post" Covid 19? Ha! They're going to milk this for at least a decade.
Ok man, but if it turns out to be a PC woke crapfest, gonna let you know💩
How much did you get paid to write this review?
I love it so much. The worst part was the theme and I honestly would love for Craig to be nominated for best actor and I hope it gets loads of nominations.
Paloma is not inexperienced. She lied to Bond about her inexperience.
For me, Bond films are great entertaiment based in lame books. That's all. I don't understand "woke" people and conservatives. Even the old ones today have a comedic touch because all the cultural differences... But it doesn't matter. Some are bad, some others are so bad that they're good and a few are really good movies. Just enjoy watching and if this particular movie is bad, maybe you can try with the 30 or something remaining...
Thanks for making a review for this I have been trying to find reviews for this movie
Great film with plenty of action and twists from the offset but what a disappointing end? The Broccoli franchise have perhaps inadvertently killed off the name “James Bond” in order to squeeze as much as they can out of Daniel Craig in a moment of desperation, instead of moving on with someone else as a fresh leap of faith. Yes of course, anyone can take up the appointment mantle of “007” but the name “James Bond” has quite clearly been wiped off from Ian Fleming’s initial foundation of what “James Bond” was initially all about. No doubt though, the 007 role will of course be ‘wokery’ rejuvenated in some shape or form but ‘No Time To Die’ has quite pivotally mastered a ‘line in the sand’, post the Daniel Craig’s overly trumpet blowing finale’. In essence, totally frustrating and considerably disappointing for the audience that have grown up to love the Bond culture.

Dra. Swann: let me tell you the story of Bond.. James Bond
easy skip for me, Daniel Craig had Casino Royale - and that was it folks. I'm not wasting my money, I rather put it in a pile and burn some in my living room for warmth and turn off my heating, than give trash movies money they don't deserve.
i liked it as well was expecting a 2 and got a 9 the re edit really really helped it
I've seen every Bond film and this is the first one I don't feel any need to see this in theaters. Just never was a Daniel Craig Bond fan.
Wtf happened to this site ? Used to be my fav movie site.    Unsubscribed
Wtd has phoebe waller bridge ever written worth a crap ?
James bond is a rapist  says the director....seems like woke crap
Is it as goods as 'Skyfall'?
Nothing will ever beat Casino Royale which ranks as easily one of the best James Bond films of all time. Biggest criticism of the Craig movies is the villains which have nearly all dissapointed. Only exception being La Chiffre but he was so criminally underused. Remi Malick was rubbish in this (not the actors fault). Should have stuck with Blofeld throughout the whole movie who I thought was much better than in Spectre.
ok .. already a fail. the 00 is for life.. and if the agent dies the 00 designation dies with them... so there wouldn't be a new 007... so with that alone this is shit and im out,
He's KIA, 007 is done
Boycott this film.
The connected mythology of "chosen one" bond was a poison pill for the Craig era.  It bloats the plots, misunderstands the appeal and squanders some genuinely excellent visuals and action.  At least we got Casino Royale
"who knew what we were dealing with in 2019..." yeah about that...
Always thought it was a given that the James Bond name and 00 ranking was interchangeable ? I.E not the agents real name.
SPOILER:     How to kill a franchise. Kill off the main character. That's me done with Bond now. My childhood ruined. Bloody idiots.
Hmm hope it's as good as you say. It's is better to get rid of one dimensional women characters in favor of different personalities
If Skyfall was a 10, then this is a 2. I don't often watch my watch during a movie, but when it happens, it's a bad and boring movie. The whole movie feels like as if it is re-packaged old garbage, with the scenes unnaturally glued together. At the end, Bond kills about 100 baddies, and when the counter is at 50, you just want to fast forward. A movie to be forgotten soon. The only interesting thing is the idea of nanobot injections. A topic that may be very actual right now, if you know what I mean.
If you watch Dr No, James Bond is his real name and 007 is his code number which can be reassigned to another person if he chose to go back to standard duties.
If they really want diversity, Rick Astley is the best choice to be the next Bond.  Like a true spy, the dude even has dark shades and a trench coat.
uughh.... Looks lame and cheesy. The casting is all lowest common denominator distracting crap except maybe Naomi Harris and the whole Spectre thing is Christoph Waltz on Letterman campy...Oh yeah, and side kicks to the head in high heels and evening gowns....FFS.
I predict that this movie will be shunned by the old fans, because too woke
Very PC of you to not call out the PC.
Joshua Sasse the New James Bond
New 007...? Only James Bond is 007
Give me Lea seydeux and ana de armas and I will die happy.
shill
Watched it yesterday evening.. it wasn't as woke as I expected! Surprisingly very good considering all the controversy with this film and production. BUT the big question is with the next film !!! This was probably my last Bond movie..  as soon as it goes 100% woke, I'm out!
Good review and incisive.
People are not ready for the woke culture and whole new era for bond's character
It's awful.
IT doesn't feel like a spoiler-free review at all.
Omg...  did any of You haters even  saw once every bond movie ? ...  this is for the first time  true bond movie in Craig era...  they albo managed to clean mess from spectre quite good. Very positive suprise
Killing bond is dumb as shit.
The villain was just too generic, with no strong background and motive
Awful movie.
It's like watching ark Knight Trilogy movies. There will be a new James Bond.
Great to hear that it sounds good especially considering im a massive Bond fan. Its just a REAL SHAME that i live in Melbourne (THE MOST LOCKED DOWN CITY IN THE WORLD ATM) and we will prob STILL be locked down come Nov 7th when its meant to come out here and I WONT BE ABLE TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GOD DAMMIT!!!!!!! :(
This review gives me hope this will be a good movie given everything reported and what we have seen with other franchises.
Kept hearing about this woke agenda stuff, almost put me off, but it's not, glad I went now. There is a bit of a lag at one stage, but  no biggee. Some great things in this film, dvd will be in my library. 👍🎥
kinda hoped Daniel Craig would do just 1 more Bond movie after this... despite all the "woke" talk surrounding this one, I'll be going to see it...
I think the movie lacks  some female and diverse characters
We weren’t wrong. They changed the script because we raised hell.
what a disappointment.
What a terrible review, can’t pronounce the Actors names properly, Speaking So fast , take a Breath Geez!! Great Film, Poor  review, Sorry!!
Does anybody know the name of the dancehall song which was played in the jamaica club scene?
James Bond isn't a codename. Calling yourself a Bond-fan!
I'm checking out of the 007 franchise once this comes to bluray. Done with bond after that.
I REALLY want to believe you when you say it's not a woke movie! If it isn't:  I'll watch it!!
It seems quite repetitive to me
Just saw it this morning, loved it. Nicely does away with any SPECTRE aftertaste. So 4 out of 5, that's Connery-level of greatness for Craig's run (QoS is great, get over it).
Just saw this, it’s awful. If you’re expecting something in the same style as Casino Royale, Skyfall etc then it’s going to disappoint you. It was all just a bit silly. The only person that comes out of that with any credit is Rami Malek. He was a very good Bond villain.
The film is shit.
I was waiting for this.
OK film -a bit too long - not the best film I've seen this year
Ugh Billie Eilish? That dead eyed, soulless looking, mind-controlled automaton does the theme song? I'll pass.
Why introduce another 007? Why not refer to her as 005 or 008?
So many secret things shown
Best comment I’ve seen on reviews of this movie, is how Daniel Craig is looking more and more like Sid James
Ana de Armas is as good looking as Lashana Lynch isn’t
No time to waste :)
Bond fans will be pleased.  Lots of easter eggs. I saw this. Great bond film
Look forward to seeing the film saturday .
First half of first half is action. Rest is drama. Villain is namesake. seemed like he’s imitating Javier from skyfall. There’s no action in climax. As a send off to bond, I appreciate it. As a James Bond movie, I’ll keep it with spectre.
... hit a little too close to home "post covid-19"... hummm... lol
Who is here because he isn't comfortable with the ending.
I was put off of seeing it by all the advertising and people saying bond would be sidelined. Im definitely going to see this though. I was hoping Ana had a bigger part , shes awesome.
Trash 🗑
No Time To Digest SJW BS!!!
That shot of the new 007 in the dark with just her lit eyes looked so good. She looks even scary. I like that.
I heard it's woke so I'm not gonna bother with it.
the new James Bond Main villain is like a younger version of Dr. No
Only Dalton's bond films interest me
Sidelined? Yeah he is. Jesus you have other agent taking his number, how much more overt do you have to get...
All I have to say is I'm glad we didn't get a woman James Bond...I mean they were seriously thinking about making Lashana Lynch the next James Bond!? Fucking please!! 😂
1.tom and jerry should never EVER speak 2. Batman should NEVER kill 3. James bond 007 never DIES, and doesn't get replaced by a strong WhaMEn
Its a giant shame he dies in this film... It seems to be a recurring theme with main characters dying in new movies.
Spoilers!!!!!!!
Bond just doesn't  grip me anymore since living daylights..I don't get the buzz
Looks promising, but I’ll wait to see the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes 🍅 before I decide to see it.
brilliant movie and strong twisted ending we will only live once to see in the big screen and once, a life time experience specially for does who grow with this Bond after saying goodbye to the great Brosnan (this will only happen once in cinema history, no other bond will experience this same scenario ever, believe me). We have all the time in the world, less not wasted or take it for granted.
I don't understand the concept of "another 007." (No, I am not going political here - take me at face value). I was always under the impression that a double-0 was an agent who was licensed to kill, and the number after that indicated the agent. It could even be two or three numbers, like 0011 or 00107.  It would go without saying that there would be multiple agents in Her Majesty's service, and at least in two previous films they were shown to us. One was 003, and the other agent was portrayed by the incredible actor who was also the antagonist in "No Country for Old Men."   So why would you have two 007s? The second agent should get his or her own 00 number. And besides, when great quarterbacks or other sports legends retire, they also retire the number. If James Bond as a character is ever killed off, then no other character should have 007 as their code name from that moment forward.
Ana de Armas saved the movie
Thing is, you cannot have another 007.  That is Bond's License to Kill number, it would be retired when Bond retires. Lashana Lynch's character would have a different 00 number.
Jane bond…
One last job
Thanks💕
Masterpiece I saw and I say it’s massive hit
No chance is this film an 8, very disappointing and hasn’t got close to previous instalments
Well let's see, the director admits in an interview that the movie is woke while trying to deny rumors that writer Phoebe Waller bridge was brought into wokeify the film, go figure. This is just another deconstruction of a popular male character. Given all the woke celebrities who gave woke interviews about how woke the new franchise is going to be I find it hard to believe that you felt it was not PC in the slightest. Good luck Jane Bond
This movie is probably the reason why MGM sold itself off to Amazon.
these 'critics' are shameless.  let's face it: the positive reviews by these 'reviewers' out there are biased and they are lying through their teeth.  they are pressured to 'save' the movie industry (esp. post-pandemic and recent trends of movie flops etc.) and to not curry disfavor with film studios/distributors/sponsors, particularly with a franchise like 007.  NTTD is/will be far WORSE than most objective viewers have been anticipating.  everything in the movie is plain ludicrous (some of the glowing positive reviews even admitted this, but downplayed it... if this was any other movie, it would have been universally panned and roasted.  talk about double standards).
Looks like a lot of CGI 💩 Fast and furious💩
so when did this woke trash crap actually get released.. cos... yesterday I thought this woke trash crap was still in the bin...... ... wot.. not woke trash crap ... dunno... whatever... most likely not watching it.... ha, ha, 'PEDWOOD,' 'go broke'... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
Phew that’s a relief
As my father once said about bond films, "I only watch them for the babes"
the biggest problem in all d.craig james bond movies is the direction.
Bond is 007. End of Story. The world doesn't want a woke 007 Bond Movie. So Spectre is DC final 007 movie. Thanks JoBlo
Cary Fukunaga is not A-List
James Bond is so old that rigor mortis has set in.
Not really a review just comments over the trailer.
I keep reading that Malek's character was a generic bond villain with nothing special about him. "I will rule the world using this tech/ virus and no one will stop me hahaha!"
#31 ON TRENDING
all actors before craig played the same character. i remember different actors talking about the same personal exprience when i watched them al back to back. craig resets the universe
So... Bond is hunting Fauci? 🤔
I no longer like such movies that are too much artificialized
I hear from all the reviewers that Ana de Armas is really good in this and she deserves her own spin off. Let’s hope they do. It would be a perfect opportunity for a woman to get an action role that is entirely new and not a “hand me down” from over used male characters.
1) The Man with the Golden Gun 2) Casino Royale (2006)  3) Goldfinger 4) Skyfall 5) The Spy Who Loved Me
hope u right m8
I'm torn on seeing this as a huge bond/Craig fan. Glad it's not as woke as we were led to believe, but it feels wrong to support the product of director/producers who don't seem to understand what their fans want
Would rather watch Howard the Duck ten times over than yet another James Bond movie 😵
This a a woke James Bond film.  End of story.   The title should've been.  No time to watch.
So it seems like the final ranking of Craig films will be:  1. Casino Royale 2. Skyfall 3. No Time to Die 4. Spectre 5. Quantum of Solace
Yeah greate film ! Awsome ! Yeah!  They killing another hero and all woke people claping.  I hate this masacre of normality .
Ana De Armas. ANA DE ARMAS!!!
Weaponized viruses. Its like they are telling you something thru movies that is actual reality.
Coming soon 'No Time to Die Hard'
End of franchise, i like my James Bond, certainly will not even bother going to see a woke james bond
JAMES BOND 007 => Sir Roger Moore RIP Roger
Craig should've retired after Skyfall, this franchise desperatly needs new blood, Spectre was terrible, and this doesnt look better...we are in a spot where we are getting bad movies (like at the end of the Brosnan era) with an actor who is too old to keep playing the character (like at the end of the Moore era). At least its finally over, a shame we lost the chance to get Idris Elba because they wanted to stick with Craig one more time. I hope Amazon makes the necesary changes this franchise needs, starting with the lead.
I cant wait for the intro!
Don't know if the Drinker is going to rip this off, but whatever, it'll be fun to see
My biggest issue with the graig era of bond is they have made him less of the bind we are used to seeing in the later movies and we know this is the goal to make him more me2 era friendly they have outright stated this.  But all this me2 attuitude change os happening in prequels so eventually he comes round to being the wrong bond for each era...in his prequel years when no one has heard of me2 he is all super me2 complant and ehen the world starts with me2 he becomes to masculine...very much a self defeating  message.  And this is why i question your review here you mention bond is very much the bond we know, but we know they have been trying to change that to make him more me2 compatible...the 2 statements cannot go exist...maybe you were just caught up in the feel of a good movie and thought this was a closer match than previously done i have no way to judge the context you are using.
Several years from now, No Time To Die will be very easy to recognize even if you don't know which one it is at first: it's the only Bond movie where everyone wears masks and stays away from anybody else 2 meters apart 😂.
Why do they keep airbrushing actors faces like we won't notice it??
Omg still debating is Jamrs Bonds name a Code. No its the same fkng character. It was established its who he really fkng is. God!!!!
Is lynch 007?
Yeah, if it's all the same, I'll be waiting for the Critical Drinker's review. This is a bit too  "mainstream media".
mark my words.. immortalized here on the internet.  if they move forward with this "woke" hand off of the 007 mantle, the franchise will die.  I don't mean tank, i dont mean go into a temporary reprieve.  I mean it will absolutely positively kill the franchise forever and for good.
Too bad this is nothing but a feminist propaganda piece.  Rip James bond.
I knew Ana de Armas would steal the show!
I think I will wait for Red Letter Media and Critical Drinker review first before deciding to watch this film. Secondly, this movie needs to make $900M to break even. That's a tall order.
Is it better than Skyfall ?
Wow this comment section…
Riffs on OHMSS!! Stopped the video right there, thats all I needed to know!
A list director hahaha
The film is not overly PC??? You’re virtue is showing. I think review was brought to us by a Hollywood shill.
Post COVID??? I think you misspoke Jo.
Hihi... Das war lustich :-D
2:18 "who knew what we were looking at when this started filming in 2019"  yea.. about that.    Guess you not heard of Event 201 from October 2019?
I've been wanting a remake of on her majesty secret service for a while I thing that story really fits this bond.
I can't take this review serious. The amount of wokeness is laughable and the next movie will be named Jasmine Bond since its lead will be a female for diversity. Phoebe Waller Bridge is one of the reasons the movie sucks now!
“Moneypunny”
If James Bond is just a "Name" then why should we care if he lives or dies if he will just be replaced?
Bond is who he is, not some name given to him and he was a man who loved and lost a wife. He is a Widower and as such, he is a existing character with history and a wife who on her gravestone is called Tracy Bond, not some made up person in the context of his story. The reason people love who James Bond is, is not only because of his "Adventures" its because of his history. Cause in the back of our minds, he is a man who once infiltrated a heist/contamination at Fort Nox. Or killed one of the deadliest assassins in the world on his private island. Or avenged his friend who was fed to sharks and took out 006. The point is, its James Bond's history that makes us love the character, no just his actions. If James Bond is just a name. Then who care if he dies, he will only be replaced.
Ironic movie title. James Bond has in fact died. RIP 1962-2021
I bet the virus will be some metaphor for white supremacy; a virus that can be deployed against ‘entire races’ probably by a megalomaniac white supremacist villain in some attempt at ethnic cleansing, to highlight the systemic oppression of ethnic minorities by the white male patriarchy. Has Waller-Bridge’s feminist lefty paw prints all over it.
another bad guy with a disfgured face How original
Casino royale will remain my favorite james bond franchise. Still the torture scene still very painful to watch 😅
James Bond is the man....like an actual male
Just lost all respect for you and this channel. But we should have known you wouldn't have the balls to call them out on all the woke bullshit.
"Money Punny"
"Time to die" -gest. Nice!
They should of released it in march last year instead of holding the release till now
I say this as a lifelong Bond fan that this looks like typical Woke drivel. The whole “le subversion to the formula” has been happening since the Brosnan days. And the casting of a giant blk woman as the new 007, even if only for ceremonial purposes, is a slap in the face of fans. Hollywood’s obsession with putting an entitled, arrogant and absolutely worthless minority front and center pisses me off more than anything else. They can’t do anything on their own, but need the savior complex of self loathing useful idiots to get their shit.
I'm very glad to hear that they didn't do a bait and switch with Lashana Lynch (Masters of the Universe: Revelation anyone?) and that the movie is 'not overly PC'.  But anyone who has seen the marketing and cast interviews or men of culture who regularly watch Critical Drinker, Nerdrotic & Co will probably want to reserve judgement on the level of wokeness until they watch it themselves or see more reviews. For example, they do include the classic 'strong action female' trope of a 55kg woman in LBD and heels knocking men twice her size flying in melee combat. I've seen drunk women trying to emulate this outside pubs and discos late on Friday and Saturday nights only to very abruptly learn a lesson about physics and biology.
NO TIME TO CARE....
Sounds like a paid shill
I've never even managed to get through spectre. I hope this one is better.
2:05 really I expect more from a channel with over half a million subscribers
I keep seeing comments about how "woke" this film is/might be. Based on this review and trailer, I don't see what the problem is, unless people are literally bent out of shape one of the agents is a black woman. Black British women exist (I am one!), it doesn't seem unreasonable that someone like me would work for M16, and if that's all it takes for an accusation of "excessive wokeness", then I have to say that you're all a bunch of snowflakes!
So the next Bond is a lady... ? I guess Bond being a white British male like in the books was too much to hope for... What's next, Shaft being a young woman from the royal family?
Talks like hes being payed for this review....
Nothing so far has grabbed me about this Movie, so I will either wait until it's streaming or maybe skip it entirely. An initial positive or negative doesn't mean much as things like that change over time. I haven't truly really enjoyed a Bond Film since Casino Royale.
Forced diversity & feminism = 00woke
Thank God the Craig era is done. Can't stand his bond. Let's hope the new one doesn't take too long
No, Miss Bond, you can not take a break to get your nails done.
😎Love this channel the most!😎
Woke wankery at its finest 🤣😭 can’t wait till they replace him with a purple haired trans activist 🤦🏻‍♂️
How do you call yourself a fan and in the next breath say you're unsure of whether Bond is basically a codename passed around? Jesus... Flemming gave him a full backstory in the books. Old-money Scottish nobility father (named Andrew Bond), Swiss mother (named Monique Delacroix-Bond), who were both killed in a climbing accident when he was 11. He's Commander James Bond CMG RNVR. It's the same character. This is basic stuff.
It's woke. And that's a reason enough to not watch the movie.
Great review 👍
It looks great, but I doubt it would beat Casino Royale.
Take some serious box office haul to recoup that Billion dollars
A virus created to wipe out families the irony
Let me guess its all woke
Best thing about this is it's Craig's last one. I've been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember but I don't like this Bond at all. I only really enjoyed Casino Royale tbh as I'm a huge fan of the original source books and thought a cracking job was made of it. After that I'm afraid they have all failed to excite me.
But there's....NO TIME TO DIE-GEST
Yeah, I'll pass for this one...
"Craig"......it's pronounced "Crayg" not "Creg"
It looks extremely stupid. No thanks, I'll pass.
speaking of climax...I like Skyfall..but, its Home Alone-sque climax was just laughable... glad to hear that this one's got a good climax.
Money Punny?
Who would you say is the better villain - Lashanna Lynch for stealing the 007 mantle or Phoebe Waller-Bridge for her sublime, woke vandalization of Ian Fleming's creation?
to all the anti-SJW channels who claimed this movie is gonna be woke dumpster fire mess of a movie, boy I wish Daniel Craig would call them out as Simu Liu did
Please tell me Hans Zimmer uses the Bond theme during action scenes. Something that's been missing through the Craig era.
A nearly 3 hour James Bond film? Give me a fuckin' break, I've enjoyed Daniel Craig as Bond but I found Skyfall pretentious and Spectre left me furious I don't care for this one but I am curious for Hans Zimmer's score. Oh and Billy Eilish sings the main theme? Shut I'd rather another shitty Adele song.
Is it feminists woke garbage? Is the black woman trans? Does she end up the new 007? If yes ill wait till streaming.
Bond dies and is replaced by the black chick at the end. Just saved you 3 hours of your life on this woke trash.
I have zero tolerance for wokeness and for any political indoctrination in media. Not going to watch this film even for free. And i cant trust this channel for unbiased reliable reviews. This channels reviews have a serious sellout shill vibes. I just set you tube to not recommend channel. Watch nerdrotic for actual honest reviews
One of the actresses said Bond is a feminist on the red carpet in London. They always have agenda, but thats not what majority pay for. All franchises destroyed. Bye Bond, bye Forever.
Sounds promising. Glad they actually put some fun in this one, which have been lacking for a LONG time in the series. I hope they keep making them like this from now on.
it's almost like there's a pattern: Casino royal-Good Quantum of Solace-Bad Skyfall-Good Specter-Bad/mixed No time to die-Good (hopefully)  now I know a lot of people like/dislike some of this is films am just saying the general opinions
Theatres are still closed here.
So…James Bond…is NOT 007
Just watched Cobra by Sly Stallone.  Aint got nuthin with this.
Nice advert. I think I'll wait for the Critical Drinker's review before I see it.
This will be the movie I finally return to theaters for.
I’m just excited for the strong female characters! Finally!
What?
Looks like a lot of CGI..  That puts me off watching..  Bonds trademark is its realism..  Many of the stunts I'm seeing here look unrealistic..  Even some of the motorcycle stunts look CGI..   It's a cartoon..  Spoils the movie..
good review video. But it is going to be hard to believe reviews of movies these days as everyone speaks according to the ideology they subscribe to. they say good things about dull things and bad things about good ones(based on what side the reviewer sees pronouns themselves, so who knows I guess it ll be hard for bond fans to adjust to forced woke ness. will watch the movie and decide for myself I guess.
Wtf, is this a spoiler review??
Craigs movies are prequels.
The question is, will I be slapped in the face with some woke BS?
Awesome review, I'm partying now that we finally have this movie🎉. Would you say this is the best Bond movie of all time?
After Daniel Craig whoever takes over the role of James Bond has got to be very good and I mean extremely good !!!!!
I can't wait october 1
Yeeaaahhhh!!!! JoBlo is back with a BOND!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I think I’m gonna pass on the tampon tossing wanna be she-bond…I’m SURE it was buddy buddy team up film except…how many jokes did the female 00 “tampon tossing”  7 make on James Bond’s account…  But seriously notice the extended trainer was all about James Bond … no female fake bond? Heh they knew they had a mess on their hands and they are trying to save it any way they can…. 900 million is a long way to just break even… also when this does fail and it will…i’m sure they will blame us men for not going to watch their “get on my feminine soap box and wag my finger at you” movie… I have much better things to spend my money on… like paying someone to watch their grass grow or watching paint dry…it least it’s more entertaining… plus I won’t get preached at…  On a side note… I wonder how much they payed this guy to talk up this movie… you couldn’t PAY me enough to watch this movie… Hollywood is just like my 6 year old kid… when he does something he KNOWS is wrong, I have to take something away from him till he learns his lesson…well Hollywood I’m taking away my money until you guys straighten up and fly right.. I hate to do it..but it’s got to be done… Hollywood is never gonna learn until we take a stand and stop paying for this crap…
Sounds to me like bond dies in the end. If so,  I'll gladly pass and wait for the reboot.
A black female bond. Not pc? I’ll pass
"...in fact they want him so badly they sent the new 007 Lashana Lyn—" yeah, I'm gonna head out. 👎🏽
OK, but how some commentary on how woke they made it?
I have a feeling the villain will be revealed to be Dr No since it involves a scientist being kidnapped and the use of atomic like bombs and a scene in the trailer showing a giant indoor pool which might be a reference to the giant aquarium in Dr. No
good. No soy SJW nonsense.
Always a handsome man to play Bond. To wokeify it they found the most hideously ugly female they could. If they want a female spy, make a female spy movie. James Bond is a man. IE: how about ugly men to be Charlie's Angels?
I think it’s great this James Bond is over 2.5 hours. One of the reasons I don’t go to the movies is because I feel ripped-off with movies under two hours. And this film sounds great and looks epic. And I hope Hans Zimmer’s score is not the same humming, low dark tones like he carbon-copies into most of his scores. So movie theater: Here I come!
Ana de Armas always has a presence to remember
WTF i checked my local theater and its not out yet.
How did you see the film when it didn’t release in theaters yet
Ill believe it when I see it.
"Money Puny"?
James bond dies and has a daughter with the main girl
Reporter asks Craig any thoughts on the next j bonds?     Craig: not my problem..
Look Fukushima called James Bond a rapist - that's enough for me to boycott troll him out of the industry . If you're a real fan - make sure he never works again
Breeze ..James born... 009...2025..coming soon.. Drama action SciFi...
who knew in 2019 indeed
filming began 2019? oh same year Event 201 is known to occur, yes pure coincidence i'm sure
The film will be hated by Bond purists. I suspect the film will have a huge drop in box office once the you know what is known.  Joblo knows what I'm taking about.
It's WOKE so I am skipping it and looking for spoilers now!
I stopped the review a few seconds in like what the fuck? Can't you you know not give away the whole plot? There was alot mentioned already that I suspected but we didn't actually know. You didn't need to give a moment by moment run through of the film. Totally ridiculous and not actually required for a review.
So this is an exclusive and it includes the trailer at the end, making it more like an advertisement than a review.  Although this review makes the film sound less like the train wreck we were expecting, forgive me if I suspect that any negatives have been omitted.  The review score is 8 out of 10, which is a good score, but it doesn't quite match all the praise in the review.  As almost nothing is said about the new 007 in the review, choosing to focus on every other character, I suspect that the character is somewhat superfluous.  Given the long length of the film, I wonder if the producers were unsure what to do with it, so they did not do as much cutting as normal.  Overall, I am pleased that the film sounds decent because I had low expectations; however, I think I will wait to see what other reviews say once the film is out - just because I do not trust exclusives. Edit: I just saw a different review and it seems as though JoBlo did not exaggerate the appeal of the movie.  The 8 out of 10 sounds reasonable.  Also, many of the assumptions people made about the direction the franchise was going in appear to be incorrect.  (Or, if you prefer to believe it this way, they cut the movie to reverse course.)
I wish there would be a James Bond film like when I was a kid where the villain was going to take over the world. 😂
Didn't skyfall establish that the name Bond is his family name and not a codename?
Sign of the Times. However, a forced promotion not based on meritocracy. Understandably, the following would never work as 007: Russians - Traditional Villains in Bond movies. Anglo Russians are a no go. Arabs - Villains of opportunity. Same as Russians. Indians - Viewed as too meek and not violent enough to deal with Villains. Latins - One would immediately suspect MI6 became uber corrupt. Blacks - Not viewed as Spy Right Stuff though individually some can be. Chinese - A non starter giving that the world is kissing their rear.  I hope the new Bond flops mightily.  Some traditions should not be messed  with. The idea of a Black female 007 is just as ludicrous as appeasing the LGBT crowd by installing a T-girl 007 with a raspy male voice. Revisionism is ridiculous. Imagine Napoleon as Transgender; Hitler as a Black male; Stalin and Castro modernized as Gay.  If the franchise means nothing these days, install a Latina mandona to madrear evil mamarrachos. A 007 speaking Spanish to seduce the said mamarrachos, and 600 million potential movie goers in Latin America  alone. Since many British are buying into Spain, that would be a more  profitable venture than KowTow to BLM.
I heard a lot of nuts throw a fit about this movie before even seeing it?
I really hope it isn't too woke. When I heard they want to make Bond less sexist I was concerned.  Being sexist isn't a good thing to be, at all, but that's Bond's character, he's a fantastic agent, funny, charming and a ladies man, but he's a flawed character who doesn't treat women well. To change that is to change the character. The only women he's treated well are the rare ones he's fell in love with, Diana Riggs character in OHMSS, Vesper and the one he fell in love with in Spectre (which I took as then going in the OHMSS direction).
Sure you watched the same film?  My take away was James got power slam sidelined in favor of the most "Political Correctness SJW Psycho-man-hating Feminist Mary Sue LGBQT hashtag MeToo flag waving girl power convoluted plotline in the entire history of pictures that move since the late 1800's. Basically a 3 hour long twisted love letter to a tiny audience of man-hating lesbians who spend 90% of the movie castrating every single male that has more than 1.06 seconds of screen time!  Still am not watching this movie. The PC SJW feminist crowd has destroyed James Bond, Star Wars, Star Trek, the MCU, DC Comics, Warhammer 40K, Disney, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, 99.9% of all sitcoms, TMNT, G.I. Joe, all forms of comedy, the music industry, [cough] MTV [cough], destroyed childhoods, ruined Ghostbusters, Thundercats, He-Man, Terminator franchise, the entire video game market and just about everything and anything else I haven't mentioned.  So,... I've crawled back into my tiny little microcosm with my still working Sega Genesis and am disappearing into the void that is Vectorman.  You kids can enjoy your twisted world of man-hating feminists and castrated men! I like my nuts exactly where they are thank you very much!  Next up: Jane Bond, the gender confused trans queer lesbian pseudo woman-man-thing-it that spontaneously changes color in order to appease the next generation of twisted SJW's. Enjoy.
Ana de Armas 🔥
Though not James Bond, another person (a "woman"!) is 007 - a first (itself a minor spoiler).  This and some others ought to be called theatrical-EXCLUSIVE (those that are released 'simultaneously' are also theatricals).  As for me, I will skip the theatres, due to both the Delta variant and having felt rather let down by Spectre (this seems a direct sequel to it).
Truthfully all the Bonds have been inconsistent. They're like the Star Trek films. Some are good ( Dr No, TSWLM, Goldeneye, CR) some are so so (Thunderball, FRWL, LTK, Spectre, TWINE) and some are well uggh (Moonraker, Octopussy, TND, Skyfall- yeah I hated it!) so this is nothing that Bond fans aren't used to. Hopefully this lives up to your review. *fingers crossed*
So it's not woke????????
At least give us a heads up before you start going deep into the story plot. I'll come back to this video later, after I've seen the movie.
Did Grace Jones get to make an appearance?
A mere 8/10? I'd like to see you try and make a James Bond movie, then we'll see how many Stallones you deserve, aye
No time to care zzzzzzzzzzz
Aaaannnnddd going to wait for amazon to stream this after it tanks.
Why is it that every time a firearm has a folding or collapsible stock, movie people always leave it folded or collapsed? Are they ALL idiots?! The directors, the actors, AND the prop masters?!
Well looks like this bond film is gonna be quite interesting.  But lets be real. If there's gonna be another  james bond after Daniel Craig then let it be a guy playing the part. Not a woman,  no offense but it's called James Bond for a reason.  The part is for a guy, not Jane bond. Get real people.  Lol!
JoBlo videos is pretty lefty most the time. So the assurance that the film isn’t woke isn’t enough for me at this time. The director called Bond a rapist. No mention of any memoriam before the end credits for Sean Connery, who passed less than a year ago. I’m waiting for rental. They’ve spent a year telling us how morally superior they are to everyone and now a few statements from Craig just a couple of weeks before release, like they just remembered who their fans are… no thanks..  I’ll rent it or catch it on Cable 9 months from now.
Nope, automatic downvote for not being honest about this movie.  We already know this is going to be a Woke SJW garbage fire of a movie that they couldn't even sell this movie off for an insane amount of money to Netflix or whomever.
Did you say: “MoneyPunny” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Virus that can wipe out high value targets but can be modified? Fox Die?
Totally hyped
Lashana Lynch as the new 007 is all the information I need not to see this movie!
So they used foxdie as the films Mcguffin that’s just great
I heard it's woke, since James Bond is "problematic". (to be honest...in the books and early movies, he was a bit rapey....).
If I fall asleep that doesn’t mean it’s a bad movie!
As someone who watches bollywood films, i love long movies. You're able to fit in drama, character development, and fully realised action sequences in longer movies. Films that are just 90-100 minutes feel very short and at times quite choppy, and im just left wondering "that's it?" Ofc there are exceptions, but films like rambo: last blood felt way too short, probably because of lack of action unlike its predecessor
I’m sold! Going to see it in the theater
This will get 90% positive from leftist critics because of its agenda and about a 20% from audiences.
There's no doubt about Bond's name since Skyfall. His family name in the old house at the end is Bond.
Not to be a negatve Nelly But it looks real Sumb and Very terrible. Lashanda Lynch looks very unneeded for the story too.
little women beating up big guys and it's not woke he says. He also thought kate was good and now wants a paloma agent spin off. This guy IS woke.
VALENTINO GOT GANGSTA SUITS ❤️
If seen it also and your right. Its to long, but only if your a little bit tired. It sometimes almost arthouse (Bond shows a lot of emotions), so this pace is not for everyone. I think this will be a bond that is not rewatched a lot. But people, enjoy!!!
Have they made the gunbarrel look less cheap
Well, I'm cautiously optimistic.  I haven't really liked any of the Bonds after Casino Royale but this one might be better.  At least this time it seems like James Bond will actually save the world (or a large portion of it)...a key component of a good James Bond movie.
I certainly won't be paying good money to see a beloved Character and Franchise being handed over to a Black Bird and Woke Studio gone insane.
Eva Green and Ana de Armas are the two sexist Bond Girls of all time.
But... does this movie fit into the structure set by the Craig Bond films? As in Casino Royale and QoS take place before ALL the other 007 adventures, Skyfall shows him sometime after all those other adventures when he's now "too old for the job", Spectre crops up towards his last days on the job, and now this one takes place after ALL those other ventures? Or perhaps the inclusion of spectre towards the end of Craig bond's career in Spectre bungles this whole scheme?
What a great review, you didnt make it sound any better than i wanted it to be or any shitter than i was worried it was going to be. I exspect nothing more or nothing less from this movie which is always a good start
I'm going to the early screening of No Time to die at the Scotiabank Cineplex in Downtown Montreal or at Cinemas Guzzo's IMAX. Looking forward to seeing this epic 007 adventure.
"Mismatched buddy vibe" or not Loshanna Lynch is NOT the new 007, and Barbara Broccoli said the character is a male and will be. It could be a different race, but it WILL NOT be a woman.  That this is an issue is still quite ridiculous as their have alreayd been SALT, LeFemme Nikita and quite a few other spy female leads.
🎊🥃yass FINALLY
It’s so unbelievable that we used to say PC and be told that it’s crazy there’s no such thing. Then things started to be made fun of by people who were PC so they could get away with being annoying. Now being PC is a metric that we go by. Just because it sounds innocent, censoring someone’s speech is censoring someone’s speech. We are doomed.
So excite!!!!
I was let down by the "it's not that pc" comments. I've come to expect better from you guys. If I wanted low brow ignorance in my reviews I'd watch the pathetic "the quartering" channel. I wasn't going to say anything, but it was impossible not to. Hopefully you go back to being "you" next review because you're better than shitty comments like that. You pick your audience as much your audience picks you my friends
Its known by now that your genetics, diet, upbringing and amount/type of regular exercise will determine alot about your interaction with information. So alot of people will not be bothered by passive aggressive, intruding elements of politics in a movie where that doesnt belong at all. Alot of people have liked Bond but the same people may not understand enough about life or be in the state of mind that lets them have a “taste”. Im happy i am sane enough to understand that this is not a bond movie. But the last good bond movie was really just casino royale, maybe skyfall too. Stay healthy and happy and dont watch the new one.
It's Bond. Armchair experts take a rest, sit back down and enjoy.
Outdoor Kniotwear will sell you the sweeter for 57 pounds.
I have a ticket to see this at an IMAX next week. I need it to be good. I'd like to escape into fantasy for a couple of hours. Fingers crossed.
What's your opinion on Idris Elba getting cast as the next James Bond? He is one of the top actors of the world and he could bring the same level of charm, swagger and general badassery to the role to eclipse some of the best Bond actors.
The trailers are 🔥🔥
I have no interest in No time to die. Fuck the director and it just reusing the same plotlines, again.
I kind of got that vibe, that it would just be the standard mismatch buddy subplot with James Bond and Lynch as the newly assigned 007. Glad to hear it's a good if overly bloated finale to Craig's run as 007 and hopefully me and my couple friends will enjoy the end of the road for this tenure of Bond next week.
If venturing into Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan level of high tech and quippy fun, then I'm so there! Its been a rough couple of years, so lets have some fun in the cinema.
The Mission Impossible series crushes Last few 007 movies
Hi I'm gay black actor Michael Douglas
A sycophantic review
F this rubbish, joblo just told me enough to avoid this like the plague.
James Bland. They shat all over the franchise and its fans. They called Bond a r@pist, a sexist, a misogynist, and a white supremacist character..  Screw this movie.. screw those who made it, and screw Daniel Craig for going along with it all. Woke feminazi rubbish.
The james bond name being a codename bs was put to rest in Skyfall since we see the graves of his parents Both labeled with the name Bond
A BLK Female 007? 🤮  I'm sure she'll have to save Bond's life.. you know because he's missing a step nowadays. She'll also be incredibly Intelligent and Bond will be in "Awe" proving white males just can't keep up to the diversity hire.
If they end with setting up a woman to take over im walking out If you want a woman spy set in this world, make a spin off. Do NOT try and replace james bond.
"Moneypunny " , I see what you did there !
Did they do the scene in the casino?
Looking forward to seeing this Bond movie. Looks pretty cool.
EXCELENTE VIDEO JOBLO VIDEOS.
If these become a tv series it will ruin the movie franchise.
The virus in this movie is basically foxdie.
It doesnt matter if its long 3 hours, it needs to be fun, entertaining and engaging, thats all i want. Skyfall was long but always interesting and entertaining not like Spectre, with some great scenes but overall a boring movie. Edit. (I just watched the movie its actually boring as Spectre)
Farewell Sir Daniel Craig! Cheer to you for 5 great Bond adventures 007. 🤘💯
God you should like a wokewood shiel
5:37 That a negative to the movie already.
The ultra PC stuff have been hinted by cast and crew. Is JoBlo calling them liars?
That’s reassuring. I do hope this one is thoroughly entertaining.
After the director apparently called Bond a rapist in the older movies, I'm not interested. There is only one 007, and that's James Bond.
Yeah no thanks.   Already saw the scene where Lynch is dressing down Bond and that was it for me.
Leslie Jones should be the next 007!
Have anyone seen MANIC?  It's from the same director
The lighting looks astonishing in some of the quieter scenes.
Woohooooo Majesty's Secret Service!
Just glad to see Bond back in action again. Daniel Craig is a good bond but I gotta tell yall honestly I like Roger Moores Bond.
I’m glad this is Daniel Craig’s last James Bond movie I never liked him as the character he never really felt like bond to me
I except it to be woke garbage. And only if critical drinker gives this one his seal of approval I will come near it.
Watching from Trinidad in the Caribbean
Seeing this opening night at the TCL Chinese Theater, can't wait!!
First!!
