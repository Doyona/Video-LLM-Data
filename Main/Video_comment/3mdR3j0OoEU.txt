Did anyone else skip the whole food part just to stop that chewing sound in your ear
30 November that's may date blood
The eating noises should be prosecuted in a court of law. Criminal.
Nice Nandos plug there
Really didn't like that opening gingey bit😩
Lawrence face revealed @35:53
' Keep streaming man grind ' From Chunkz is so funny😭😭
Please never eat again on a podcast it sounds horrible in your head phones and you man are chewing bare loud 😂
If filly didnt order nandos the vid wouldve been dryyyyyy
When chunkz said disabled the bully kid was hilarious 😂😂😂
The way chunkz describes food ☺️
6 months on from 22k followers to 1026046. Incredible from Ginge.
How much did Nandos pay for this undercover advertising???
food on the pod needs to be a regular thing

Ain’t no way that’s Lawrence from Xo , bro fell off he’s now behind the camera 😂
Great podcast but I’d smoke all yous at Fortnite !!
Jimmy Carr, Peter Kay, Adele and Ed Sheeran. Sounds like the worst blunt rotation of all time.
The chewing noises 😫
"Best Mac & Cheese" what a low bar
Legends the lot of yas
3:50
I would love to have a nandos with Chunkz and Filly I swear down lol
This a Nando’s add 10:01
"ive had it 3 times, it's been out for about 5 days. you do the maths" had me dead.
Fifa died from Fifa 07
them saying pro clubs aint good enough and now look! Up the GIRTH!!
I love you guys but the chewing right by the mic was too much for me🤯😭. Philly was talking about the sounds of chewing and drinking being an  ick but here he is participating 😂💔
Grew up poor but she owned her house 🤣
Unreal chilling with mates ordering food and waffling! What a trio as well 👍🏼 need Ginge back on the podcast asap and a food review segment😂
Na man he ain’t it
Michelle Keegan’s brother is my assistant headteacher at my skl 😂😂
Gingyy😂 0:33
Why have we normalised slapping your lips like a warthog while eating 🤣🤣🤣
We need part 2 of this 100000%
I just had Nando’s an hour ago for Iftar and watching y’all eat is making me more sick cause I’m that full but I’m keen to watch the rest of the podcast.
Great pod guys!
You lot haven’t tried real mac and cheese 😢
They need to bring more food on the pod
Can't say boo too a goose these days 😂
Is that Lawrence McKenna in the background?
Top man Laurence on the pod
chunkz harry reference ! xD
Please make this podcast to the GB radio
❤❤❤❤
Just me who cant stand hearing the chewing and lipsmacking glad they are enjoying the food but its so hard listening when thats all i can focus on 😂😭
Boring
Why THE FUCK would yall think it’s okay to eat and chew all in the microphone ?! That’s disgusting af
This episode has turned into a mukbang😂
I still play FIFA/EAFC but only occasionally, don't have enough time to get fully into it and there are just other games I prefer playing
Came here from listening to the Audio just to let you man know that just listening to you munch Nando’s is butterz 🤣🤢
this has to be the best podcast
CHUNKS AND FILLY!!! Not just saying this as a proud South African🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦 I swear to god it's true!!! 😃😃😃 You guys should come to South Africa, and experience  Nandos here, it's where Nandos originated from!!! I've been to the UK, and many other places and have had Nandos all over but it tastes different!!! The South African version hits you in the soul🥹. It's tastier and saucier. I'm from Cape Town, South Africa by the way 😃🇿🇦 Please give it a try! Maybe you can make a fun video about the experience💡🤣
THERE CALLED VEGETABLES 😂😂😂😂😂😂 i fucking lost it
I don’t think chunks likes filly, seems like he tolerates him
Love these 3 so much. Ain't laughed like this for a long time.
Filly is as tall as Raheem Sterling, u can see in the video with chunkz and raheem
Chunkz and Filly in a sidemen among us?
mate this is quality
As a Mexican when man said chicharito it killed me
Ginge is the most entertaining person alive atm and i love it😎
It’s your fault for playing FUT
Is Laurence McKenna the producer
9:30
Ginge always adaptable with his good vibe.
28:00
I’m from the same area ginge is from glad to see him doing well proud of you rkid 💙 Yanited yanited ⚽️
The way filly adds 13 every time he says angry ginge 😂😂😂😂
Krept or konan next
Agree Ultimate team is dead and Pro clubs is the only reason I play it loving the podcasts btw
My birthday is 14th November 😅
Nandos must be paying a shit loads. Nandos isn't that good.
We all gunna ignore chunks said “disabled a bully kid”😂😂😂 51:00
Chunkz needs to close his fucking mouth while eating 😤
I’d rather be skint and in good shape than got bread and eat at 50mph and look like a melted ice cream on a cone that’s just me tho
Do you guys hane a nandoes vip card
Chunks looking like that fat ting out of norbit thought he was on a weight loss journey
When filly wanted to chat about pro clubs and they weren't having it😭😭😭
Chunks answer about being poor was spot on ❤
Watching this with headphones and the sound of them eating is pissing me off😂. Watching without headphones
Great MUGCAST mannnnn!👊🏼👊🏼
aint no way he called lando norris not cool
Brother take my advice and stay away from Nando's you will be surrounded by many sussssshs...
who else googled peter kay😭😭
Proper grubs. Eat with your mouths shut
Seeing chunkz dance and get happy with food makes me lovw him even more ahhh!!!! Getting excited for food is pure
If I was the producer I’d remove the eating since it’s funny nothing against the brothers. But you really want man to watch somebody just yammin a Nando’s .
42:40
you lot lol by the way south african nandos hits different......top show
This made me put in a Wolt order for a döner burger 😂😂
10:45 and you man got me hungry. I watched this episode before however I am inspired by these guys and want to start creating content. I work as a graphic designer however the 9-5 isn't for me. Being chained to my desk looking to be busy is such a waste of life. Loved hearing ginge's story.
If you don’t have sausages, bacon or black pudding… on a breakfast… WTF do you have?!! What is left?!
Chunkz put timber on. Thought he was banging gym too what a shame
Chunkz is a different person when food is involved 😅
Ginge clapping got me dead 😭
37:05 51:53
That Nando's order was the the slickest Ad I've seen yett.
Do one with caseoh pls
She wasnt comparing to chunkz she was saying she wants u chunkz lol
ginges crush is my head teachers sister
Facts fifa fucking sucks these days
He’s a real one for taking about mw2 lobby’s todays kids would never stand a chance in them 😂
was that Laurence talking off cam at 10:23?
43:22 is absolutely hilarious
Please don't eat in our ears again 🤢 Love your podcast boys ❤
4:05 48:05 57:27
Deluuuuuded by your young audience. When Your both mid thirty. Deluded as both your music. Come off utube with ur coconut oil face
Need another fully n chunkz X angry ginge pod ASAP PLEASEE 🖤✨
Not the Intro being Tayc DODO 🔥🔥
Binge watching them, I have to control myself sometimes at work. Making it go by faster for sure. Definitely a fan now, I’m clocking ya in every time ya post just like my boys James and Fuhad.
This is how you can tell that the majority of your audience are kids. Glossing over the fact that Filly said no one in the UK can be poor yet thousands if not millions of kids go hungry night after night after night because they can't afford food, yet because they have a roof over their head. they aren't poor and that's a very fucked up thing to say
Chunkz master class performance
5:12 "ra im big aren't I" huge pause😂 especially in the whisper voice🤣
I miss Nandos, I ate it before I was Muslim but it’s not halal here in Australia 😩
it’s how people associate poverty with Africa 🥲 like y’all really need to stop that
I love how chunks even eats like a Somali 🤣🤣 No but real talk! Luv you guys! paus.
I’m so glad at least some stuff from SA are clear (Nando’s, rugby and cricket). Not much but come on!
5:39 “there called Vegetables” That was hilarious 🤣
Not fond of this guest but love my boys chunks and filly
Lawrence mckenna????
chunkz. chew with your mouth closed sir🤣
Icl I saw the thumbnail and thought who’s this dude imma skip episode, turned out Ginge made me laugh the most , shout out ginge #newfan🫡
This episode is really wholesome 😊
gross asmr of chewing ew
Ah no I can’t listen to people eating man
Is that Lawrence Mckenna behind the camera? Didn't realise he was producing for Chunkz and Filly now
Who else was surprised to hear Laurence's voice
haven’t heard Laurence in a while
🤣🤣🤣🤣 “disabled a bullied kid”  51:05
Respect chunks but close your mouth man 😂 I can't handle people that eat like that man
meow-ed is a crazy way to pronounce melted cl
No one else clock that Chunkz said “disabled a bully kid” @ 51:03 💀🤣
someone clear this one up for me and tell me if it’s Laurence talking in the background who use to be with true Geordie???
35:45
I came here for the Nando’s, important stuff here
Wait until filly realizes people normally only get 2 weeks off a year.
10:15 Is that Laurence McKenna?
Get Amelia on !!!!!! The people Need to see that ✨
they havent adapted to being a podcast... the amount of times they r saying "for the audio listeners"
🇵🇸
NANDOS is not halal Chunkz……they allow the chicken to be stunned before slaughter which puts a big question mark on halal validity
Merch called “banned” or “ur banned”
Bro eating a feed for a segment with a guest is wicked! Maybe leave for later on in the pod idk but was lowkey hoping you boys had a nandos feed with aitch
Nandos plug for the brand deal!😂
34:28 😂😂😂 I'm dead. This whole bit about his Nan is hilarious!
fam love you lots, but don't be chewing with your mouth open in front of the mic like it's an ASMR Podcast... that's just disgusting lol
Worst episode till now
boost
Had to skip this episode because I cannot stand mouth noises.. sorry guys, I couldn't bear listening to that..
I hate how fat people eat, ginge and chunks need to chill man
Has to have part 2
Is it me or was that not Laurence McKenna asking the boys a question from behind the camera? Am I going crazy? That sounded exactly like him lol  lol as it went on I saw it was indeed Laurence! Is he directing/producing the show? Happy to see him being involved and multiple things!
15:03 that look from chunkz was funny
There broccoli is unreal!!
Nando’s should have sponsored this episode… i ordered while watching
Easily HAD the capabilities to be the best podcast on the internet. I Used to rate Chunks but now iv seen that he eats like a scruff... nah not on, shut your damn mouth when your eating you angin guy!! Absolutely no need what so ever to eat like that!!
I love filly and chunkz acting skills
😂
wondered where Lawrence ended up 🤣🤣
12:30 18:30
Chunks’ mouth was full from 9:46 to 11:22😂😂 love though alhamdullilah you can eat such foods
Best first 10minutes of YouTube I’ve watched in years
Love this podcast, watching all the way from Cape Town South Africa keep up the good work ❤👐👐👐👐
Might be the best one so far 😭
47:09
Love from Ghana 🇬🇭 ❤
Respectfully, the mac and cheese is dead 🤣 réal mac and cheese shouldn’t be white
Mate the disabled kid story had me creasing, you have great chemistry.
I didnt know i have the same bday as ginge...

W
Great promo boys! 10/10❤❤😊
The smoothest nandos sponsor 🤣🤣
First time seeing people eat on a podcast, I fw it tho🤣🔥
Was that Laurence McKenna I heard at like 10:30 ??
Thank you Chunkz for stopping Filly from talking about Africa, he don't know shit about Africa 37:30
I dunno why Filly ended the podcast so abrubtly just as it was getting lively
34:40 jokes on filly again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
30:10 “So LeTs TalK aBouT You’rE EarLy LifE Then MaTe” wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The look Chunkz gives is hilarious
Filly such a wet whipe
Filly is a mess 😂😂😂😂😂 I love it when Chunkz Violates him
Filly’s gay and he don’t even know it
Wag1 for filly 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was brought up on call of dury lobbies. Guy would have been like 3 😂
5:19 chill out😂😂
This was a top , watch . For some reason I had a misconception of chunks and filly but there tops guys!
Haven’t watched a full pod in years ginge too funny
Get ice spice on there
I feel a bit bad for Filly sometimes, feel like Chunkz can come across a bit dismissive towards him.
I wish you would put subtitles on your videos, I'm hard of hearing and your British accents make it harder for me to hear haha 😂
what is the set up for using DSLR for live stream anyone know and pleases NOT PC SET UP only outside walk around SET UP
Nando’s is horrible
WHAT DID HE JUST SAY ABOUT HIS NAN?!?
Boys we need Aitch and Ginge to meet 🤣🤣
Chunkz putting that weight back on
In the beginning filly sounds like a mosquito
Ginge is fucken class, mad episode boys
Filly saying you can’t be poor and from the UK might be the most stupid thing he’s ever said.
Chunks needs to lowe the nyamage on the mic wanna pull my ears out blud
If you came from shorts, the time stamp is 42:40
That intro should be Angry Ginge’s video intros I swear 😂
Never seen anyone beg for a sponsor so much 😂 nandos pay the boys man hook em up with the sponsor
First time watching the podcast so far really nice 👍🏽
That last scenario was out of Eastenders 🤣
Nobody talking about “disabled a bullied kid”😭😭😭😭
Loz been in the back is soooo hecticccc
Bro I don’t Think I ever heard chunkz swear uno n I’m hearing f bombs left rite n centre wth😂
This is by far the best podcast out at the moment
43:25 51:55 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The chewing down the mic is vile🤢
Chunkz eating like true Somali legend 😂
How has it already turned into a mukbang
That Lozza I hear behind the camera haha
I wish Nando’s was in the Caribbean it looks so good 😅
Jesus loves you, turn to Him he wants you to be in Heaven❤️
Fifas dead this year
Is that Lawrence behind the camera
chunks looking like a bowling pin
This,cut the cameras and shxtsngigs are the only pods I can watch throughout 😂
Nando’s ad 😂
Is that Laurence McKenna speaking?
I had to stop watching this due to the chewing and chomping down the mic, if you wanna eat do it off camera this aint a fucking mukbang
funniest podcast i’ve watched 🤣
I can’t watch this when they eating.
Jack Fowler in the next episode pls
Filly and Kai try so hard to increase their height
Ginge could be the W2S of Beta Squad fr.  I’m saying it.  😂
Boys leave the food out of the pods please.   Open mouth and chewing and talking sounds like an immigrant household at dinner time man.   Bear lipsmacking and chomping. Cannot focus on anything else.
30:50
Why did chunkz kinda look like black beard from one piece at 37:25
Who ever works the camera just zoom in a bit while on the wide angle don’t let the table take up so much space from that angle, all love mate <3
51:04 "You disabled a bully kid" 😂😂😂
Amazing episode guys,really had a good laugh.
This episode is amazing and I don’t even know angry ginger 😭
Chunkz telling them to keep streaming and grind sent me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 43:24
Just slappin lips in to a mic. Eat after lads, nasty stuff
You are doing to much with the food man. Promoting the hell out of it wow
Imagine an hour of them scanning in silence 😂
Chunkz's nando dance 😂
Yall need a stand for the ipad man😭 it hurts seeing u two just holding it or leaving it flat on the table 😭
Ice Spice looks like she has downs tbh
Did filly fart at 52:46-47??? LMAOOOO
the nandos placement / marketting on this tho. fair play. making bread & eating good
Chunkz getting excited over Nando’s is my new favourite moment from the podcast episodes so far😂😂
Is that the same Toby from James & Fuhad???
what happened with blind ranking?
Its crazy when ginge is the same age and from the same city as me. Inspirational
So, where can I get some Clean Heartz gear?
🤔 bring on Jack Fowler pls
That Nando’s advert was obvious
We need ishowspeed here
Stop watching when u heard the food squelching, lips slapping  😅
Eating on the pod without a warning label should be illegal dutty manners eating u man yam
Do they get paid to do the little Nando’s food review? 😂 if not, Nando’s pay them. Iam craving the food because of them 😅
Someone should tell chunkz to chill out😂😂😂
Loz is a producer !?
who the hell is the guy in the back, i recognise his voice but cant put a face on it
Don't they need to put #ad for the nandos promotion?
What is Lawrence doing on the pod??? Recognise that voice anywhere!!
GOD BLESS
No hate but laurence is so jarring in these videos
best one yet
“You’ve got a relationship with EA? Tell them to sort their shit out” 😭😭😭 had me crying
Is that Lawrence Mckenna in the background?
I wish they thought about how great of a job their mics are doing picking up all that chewing😭😭😭love yall tho!!
study patter - come glasgow we excel in it. fuck me sideways yous could put adrenaline to sleep.
Merch idea for Ginge, PALM TREE
class trio
Trust me Kaci is not looking AngryGinges way 😂😂😂
please give us time stamps
For the people who didn’t understand the start they were singing the melody to D O D O by tayc
Chunks eats like a pig man jheeeze
Lads if you’re gonna do a promo, just say and advertise properly.  don’t try pretend man are just scranning it’s bugging
black puddings scottish but we’ll forget about that
Have I just watched an hour long Nando’s advert 😂😂😭😭
I’m sorry chunkz but clean heartz logo looks like a detergent logo. I wish it was different I really wanna get one
This is the best Nando's advert I've ever seen
As much as i loved angry ginge’s energy in this, i didn’t really like how chunkz & filly were doing unnecessary flexes to each other. Just my opinion.
Bros need to be faster taking the food out that bag 😂 fully been waiting on his perinaise
as much as I wanna watch this episode, I actually cannot because of the eating sounds.
these 3 are just so perfect together love watching all 3 of them separately but this one where all 3 goats are together hits different much love!
"Tastes like a facking Jaffa Cake" is so funny
just waiting for james n fuhadddd
Close your eyes he sounds like Sam Thompson
The loaded fries from Nandos are illegal 🤤
"I compare it to africa and that" come on now really? 😐😭niqalile ke manje
PETITION TO STOP EATING ON THE POD! I really want to watch this but genuinely get enraged when I hear people chew with their mouth open. idk if I can handle it
The way these lot are making me wanna order Nando’s after I always said it’s way overrated 😂😂
chunks didn’t say bismillah 😮
Only discovered this pod recently. (Yes its only got like 8 episodes) but man can I just say this was super entertaining, I love Angry Ginge as is but Chunkz and Filly are fun and funny to hear talk. I am aware of them from Beta Squad and some Sidemen collabs but keep doing this man. Theres too many podcasts but I like this one. Some podcasts I used to love I don't always watch now, I love to see it when podcasts are starting off usually its more fun and refreshing. Stuff over 100 episodes can feel boring cause you know what you are in for and it comes out predictable as hell.
Is that Lawrence asking them questions?!
Muslim music just sounds like flies inside a pringles tube.
40k a month on just twitch subs alone is mental
“Which hood” took me out 😂
War is terrible, we don’t need it, we don’t want it
Love it 👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lawrence reading out problems brings me back to the true geordie days🥲
No, love my bro Chunks but please.. Never eat on this show again..
the minute the roleplay started i physically cringed and ended the episode there lmao
bro do yall not see how chunkz is at both of their throats the whole time like there was defs shit going on
Could be in Lithuania hahahah she may be 😂😂👏🏼👏🏼well done filly
BRINH JOHNY CARREY❤
This is one of the only YouTube videos that actually make me laugh ❤😂
Chicharito burger is elite😂
Chunkz eating with his mouth open is really annoying me😂
that intro was goated haha
Not me going to Nando’s straight after watching the pod 🙄
mate chunkz needs to learn to eat w his mouth closed🤢
Seamless advertising. Fckinv love it
I love you guys but the chewing is mental 😭
F**k off I need a Nandos now 😢
Always wondered where lawrence went after True Geordie. happy he has found a good home.
Nando’s is shit 🤷‍♂️
I want Nando’s now
Bring on Niko!
Love how this turned into a mukbang
Sik
filly be high on success
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
icl I've not heard the best things about ypur guest but you guys be showing people in their true light - if Filly and Chunkz rates someone then they must be good!
chunkz at 37:23 actually gave me the ick 😭
I need to go Nando’s 😊
Eating on pods should be banned cuz I do not wish to see the food in ur mouths
Watched all of these podcasts so far but the eating noises are not rated at all… bad idea
Did I just hear Lawrence in the background?
52:46 someone let it rip
Damn is that Lawrence McKenna I hear👀
Love you boys, but Filly needs to learn how to eat with his mouth closed 😂❤
😂😂❤❤😊😊🎉🎉
Romans 10:9-10  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
This had to be longer
This is my go to pod to be frank ❤❤
My favorite episode 😭😭😭😭
Ginge is an updated version of Tommy Innit
Man said there’s only one type of person who can say anything and chunkz goes wroetoshaw😂😂😂😂
Ive actually never had nandos befofe tbh
Never knew Lawrence was the director of this podcast..
Don't watch this just listen. Watching food comingbout of chunks mouth is disqusting.... has no manners at all. Philly n ginge atheist eat with there mouths shut. I vant watch this show again chunks is like a 5 year old starving child
Is that Lawrence in the background?
Is that laurence mckena on production ?
39:32 L M F A O !!! BEST PART OF THE PODDY
Rate ginge but can’t say he says what he wants and doesn’t care because I did the apology video recent 😂😂😂
I love how they ask for dilemmas and proceed not to give any advice😂
Anyone else notce Laurence from True Geordie is in the production team?
Of course Lawrence has his creative mits on this podcast
Atleast link the guest Account in the title
Nahhh this was a hard watch 😂😂 stggg they was mockingggg
Funniest episode yet this trio is goated
is that Loz in the background?
one of the best episodes
Best episode 😂
Loved this
Great podcast these 3 are amazing
you man kill me🤣🤣
Angry ginge could easily slide in as a third host ..
Yeahhh great pod 🐐
Decent interview but Filly needs to learn to let ppl finish their sentence. He constantly interrupts people whilst they’re speaking and I know it’s probably innocent and he’s just excited to share what’s on his mind, but it can come across as rude and disruptive to a conversation when it’s done too much. Just some constructive criticism. Glazers don’t attack me.
With muffin shaped hash browns are they talking about? Lmao
Is that Laurence I can hear or am aye tripping
I never realised Laurence was behind the camera, one of my favourite blokes on and around YouTube. Glad to see he's doing well!!
Just thought Ginge needs to do a 20v1 on sidemen channel would be jokes 🤣
We need speed on one of these and to actually see a normal side of him. That podcast would be the best episode.
Chunks needs to start live streaking Ginge him and filly on a live stream would be funnyyyyy ahah
Can somone Tell me the song they are singing in the start please!!!
I think you guys should chuck some clues in the podcast as to who the next guest is gunna be
Is that Laurence asking the questions?
Chunks table manners of a fresh bulldog
The chewing is so off putting!!!
From when they where getting gassed over the meady mac and cheese i had to check the description if it was sponsored.
These guys ordering Nandos with FU uncle Sam money is genius, peep that 😉
omg even I know Peter Kay and I'm from the US 😅
Getting him when joyce is your Bredrin is wild💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ginge is jokesssss
No way Lawrence is behind the scenes on this?
speaking with your mouth full is scatty man
The improv at the end was 10/10 great pod
Angry fringe
I really wanted to watch this episode but I couldn't do it cuz I hate when ppl are smacking their lips when they eat. I'm sorry but that's a pet peeve of mine.
Is that Lawrence McKenna behind the camera?
is laurencece mckenna producing this🤣
Big up the mandem for taking to someone from Manny like myself so well Ginge is showing that even us from up here can make it if we believe in ourselves👏🏾👏🏾
Not y’all remixing Dodo by Tayc in the beginning 😂😂😂😂
All I can hear on this is chunks slopping away it’s killing me man
@Lozcast asking the question at 10:25 - is he involved in production?
You give the best reminders sis, so happy I found your page alhamdulillah 🫶🏼
Love this trio’s pair. ❤ Was smiling and laughing throughout the whole show.❤️  Keep it up lads ❤️❤️😊
The lighting making ginge look transparent , he hella white
disabled a bullied kid??? 51:03
Chunkz’s table manners are exactly what I expected 🤢🤢🤢😂
Lmaooo this podcast a vibe
Filly glazing
starting with ordering food was fire
Is that Lawrence McKenna producing ??? 10:20
best Nandies sponsorship ever 😭
1:02:17 chunkz speaking facts
i say this in the nicest way possible please dont make your "podcast" a "mukbang" especially for the one's who are "only listening" it can get jarring when you directly eat in front of the microphone. Love you Guys ❤
Love this pod, I would say though if there’s a way of moving the guests mic from blocking their face most of the time that would be great.
upload twice a week i could watch this all day 👍👍👍
I absolutely love how excited Chunkz was to eat 😊
Instead of saying poor u can say ‘we’re u financially stable’ love
43:48 I believe jj is just busy or man fell asleep 😂😭 but I feel chunkz pain 😭😭😭😭
42:49 NAA JJ 😂😭😭😭😭😭😭 that was a violation 😭😭😭😭
This podcast is the only podcast l can sit down and listen to 😤👌 so amazing 👏
Chunkz won't rest until the food is finished 😂
Where do you send the dilemmas to?
If you haven’t watched it yet PAUSE it and order a Nando’s before you press play
30:59 filly stretched it with that one but that topic is tough still
bro mentioned Lithuania 🥰
26:17 he ain’t wrong fifa shit now
angry ginge might be funny but hes acc bare rude/ condescending
Chunka demolished that nandinos lol

These man got me craving Nandos at 9am lol
I was in the same mindset as filly never understood how someone could be poor in uk as my mom was on benefits and part time work still managed to raise us with food always in the house but it really did shock me to hear alot of children actually go hungry in the uk
Get Ginge in a beta squad video !!
Is that Loz?
At 1:01:53 was an ick for me ngl
Chunks could eat a Nandos for the rest his life without taking a break!
great episode keep up the great work
The tayc intro 😂😂
This has been the BEST one yet pt. 2,3,4,5… NEEDED!!
Best pod so far 🔥
Great episode. Thanks for putting me on to Angry Ginge. @nandos please sponsor Chunkz and Filly they fully deserve it.
Chunks please chill out u make me hungry
I'm a ginger man in america born on the 13th of march I think filly got me and Ginge confused, easy mistake lmfao

Chunks you were doing so well but you're putting the weight back on bro keep it in line STW
Chunkz is jokeee 😂 "its so creamy" *dolphin noises*
... :/
Divide the vid up into 10/15 parts with different titles. People want to hear/watch what they want to watch for said person. Early life|youtube|drama… Etc.
51:04 “ disabled a bully kid”😹😹😹
The chewing in my ears is crazy
This, darkest, HP top three so far elite the vibes were so good with ginge 👏🏽
When Ginge says he knows for a fact they don’t pay each other to be in videos😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 mad funny 😂😂😂😂
Chunkz munching like the old Chunkz 😂😂😂
Is that laurence mckenna behind the camera asking questions?
I love how Filly ask the questions to help his friends expand their mind and helping them think further in business!! Great friend Filly is!
The chewing on the mic ain’t it man 🥴
Big boy nandos sponsor 👏🏾
Yooooo those sounds being made whilst eating are not ok 😭 I wanna watch this so bad
Is that lozcast in the background
Should do it as a mukbang every time!
Chunkz had me wanting nandos Frfr and that Mac n cheese lol but Happy for ginge as u need this kind of content creator in the world being himself and u can tell he’s humble but just funny asf! Literally like Chunkz he’s true to himself and He matches energy with everyone, what a lad! Big up the show and chunkzinoo!
Elite elite elite episode
big up ginge
Is that fucking Lawrence McKenna?!?!
Didn’t know Lawrence moved to these
I’m glad these mouth/eating noises chilled. 🤢 I almost gave up on the video just a few mins in. Glad I stuck around, hilarious episodes guys 😂 well done!
Nandos under seasoned my chicken  10 years ago and been boycotted ever since 🖕🏽
Is that Laurence from true Geordie reading out the dilemmas?
NYK CHAZZA seriously a goat banging content, go show him love
The marketing is genius
Chunkz looking like the original again no more shrunkz
Do you ever think YouTube will start showing 3 ads as standard just like how they did with the 2 back to back 👀
Seeing ginge make it like this so humbling and makes it seem possible for everybody out there. Well done lad ❤
one of the funniest podcasts episodes i’ve every seen
We should see Chunkz streaming, I swear it would be so jokes lmao
so nandos didn't pay uou guys ?
Fifa is still booming but does my head in
Chunkz dancing because the food is good is me am not the only one 😅😂😂
Anyone else peeped chunkz said “you disabled a bully kid” 51:04 💀😭😭
Is Laurence from true geordie pod producing this 😭
12:00
Add ginge to the beta squad asap him and harry would be too funny together
ginge is amazing, stops filly from waffling at the right times lool
As soon as i get 2 Londen im going 2 nandos
Isn't it illegal for you to not clearly mention that it's an Nandos advertistment/sponsorship??
Wait Lawrence McKenna is the producer ???!
8 eps no misses 🤣🤣🤣
Loved this lads big fan and Ginge is a legend! Defo need more content with him and you lads
10:17 Laurence from true geordie behind the camera?
@lozcast now working with the boys after moving from geordie madness.
Whosever idea it was to eat through the entire pod is lost. Sensitive ass mics picking up all that chowing an slapping. Imma miss this one smh
I need ya to never chew on the mic again bros cmon 😂😂
omg we're getting the old chunkz back!!! LOVED THIS FAVE POD YET😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The New W2S we needed 🧡
Honestly these 3 together is unreal it was soo much better when chunkz got more involved honestly I’m dying after that please make a 2.0 of this there is soo much more you guys can talk about it was hilarious keep doing what your doing lads love it
Is the guy out the back Lawrence from the old pod with true geordie?! I swear I recognise that man’s voice
anyone know the hat that chunkz wears please
Is that Laurence on production? Mad hearing his voice again!
Best podcast I’ve ever seen this trio is unmatched!
Why did that sound like a Diss to lithuania man
Mine came from Lithuania
Ps my lil lad is feeeeeeling fillys daily duppy and 100 bags and feels the line that u bought ur sis a rolly, hes 7 but hes a G 😂 keep doing ur thing its enlightened
the best podcast to exist
Guys you lot are killing it. I love how humble you  are while ur lapping up the Ps from the industry. Your showing the kids from the ends that they can be something. I'm addicted to your content.
Dem boys know how to entertain waiting on the next banger
Was that a Nando’s add or not😭
Can’t lie this podcast is long overdue always waiting for the notification about new eps!! Keep up the work rate bro’s 💪🏾
I'm also born on the 13th and it's also my favorite number
3:17 wroetoshaw 😂
How much did Nando’s pay the mandem for this?
I'm in Australia and I went straight to Nandos UK website to look up their orders because Nandos Aus is lame and doesn't have the Mac N Cheese and I am lividddddd!
I just opened the app and seen the thumbnail and had too sit and watch this. Ginge is class and i knew this as a trio would be hilarious! Im glad i clicked i normally only listen too podcasts but u lot are so visual i think i would have not enjoyed and laughed half as much if i didnt watch it.  Spotify sort it and and sign the boys up so we can get the best of both worlds yeh???
The impromptu muk bang, love dat 😅!
Is that Lawrence I hear?? Happy to see he’s producing the pod
this podcast just wast long enough hahahahha i could have watched these 3 for hours!!
Watching them eat nando’s whilst I’m in Hargeisa 😢😢
Lawrence 😳
Chunkz: "disabled a bullied kid" 😂
Tell the guy who’s reading the questions to move into audio books !! Lom
From time i put this on n just finishing now went up over 20kviews
Not gonna lie, I don;t mind people eating. But hearing the constant smacking in the background is so annoying for some people (like me). Really triggers the Misophonia.  Which sucks because I want to listen and waccht.  I doin;t know if you're able to see if you can get rid of the low sounds or adjust the mic for a next vid.  This would be very appriciated, because you guys are amazing!
51:05 “ you disabled a bully kid in my year “ - chunkz
I've been having such a shitty week that I just couldn't wait to see Chunkz and  Filly show,, now IM OK and ready for another week, thanks guys.
Chunks is soo fat it's starting to be unattractive😫
we made the right guy famous
lawerence mckenna in the background my goat
The song at the beginning?
Get Mohammed Hijaab on
🔥
We need all the beta squad members one by one on the podcast!!!
Did they discuss the Madame Joyce situation? I cba watching the whole thing to know
I CAN SEE THEM GREYYYS CHUNKYYYY ALL GOOD THO U OLD YUTE
Pedros better.... all the south africans in this section better spam it up... pedros better! 😂😂😂
Lawrence on production yeh?
When chunks comes to south africa the home of nandos and he finds pedros he will lose his mind 😂 pedros is literally opening up shops opposite nandos and the lines at pedros literally run nandos out of business! Chunky will be in heaven 😂
Ginges face after chunks said Sunday roast dead 💀
If I'm darkest I will be pissed where was all this food when he was being your first guest
Love how chunks is just minding his own business eating while fully nd ginge are talking
as a French fan its amazing to see you start this episode with dodo from tayc ahahaha keep going guys
I love filly but I’ve clocked the pattern. He always seems to gravitate to the best person at whatever platform he wants to go to next. Ie chunks. Aitch. Ginge ect
Lando over Lewis?!! Naaaaaaaa man
This podcast was jokes😂😂😂
Yanited Yanited
We need another pod with ginge this three duo is hilarious
Was the producer Lawrence from the true Geordie podcast?
I need my American friends to get on this side of YouTube 💀💀
Getting w2s on this would be mental
😂😂😂😂
well this has made me want nandos
No way they gave Lawrence a job as a producer for the pod. Big L boys you can do better
Guys I looove your podcast but 🙏 PLEASE 🙏 do not eat while podcasting, the noises are too crazy 💀😅
Funniest ep so far
Is that Laurence McKenna behind the camera
I don’t respect chunks and filly for bringing this boy on their podcast. Bad for the community. Angry ginge encouraged his fan base to be actively racist and bully Joyce (a black woman). They should have never put him on. This is sell out behaviour
what a combo! All 3 of their chemistry is off the charts, kept me hooked from start to finish. Never a dull moment, pure hilarity throughout. 👏🎉
Wtf is the sponsor start.. get on with the regular show
Ginge wwwwwww
Just wish I was eating Nando’s tbh
mate chunks looks so drippy in this vid
The person who raided his stream must be pissed
Chunks smacking his lips while eating pissed me off for the whole podcast 😂
Chunks talking bout Kai without talking bout speed who his bredrin😢
Best podcast on youtube I am glad chunkz really did it shout out to the assistant yung filly
Is that Lawrence from True Geordie ?!?!?!?
That intro gave Daniel sturridge vibes😂😂they need to get him on a podcast
Good episode 😂🤍
This was class, I wanna see more ginge in these👍
M just 15 mins in m feeling hungry as I've never had food for like 2-3 days plus these sounds effects man ☠️n m bad at cooking so 😭L
Chunkz is so full , you can tell 😂”Yeah man make sure you subscribe” then suddenly “End the video”😂😂🫶
Yay a new episodeee 💗
This episode is hilarious ngl😂😂😂
Now i understand how chunkz was as big as he was. Only met one other person who is this happy to eat food in my life
jack fowler next🙏
Chunkz and nandos might be a better combo than Chunkz and Filly 🤣
Who's the guy in the background talking? Is it that posh berk from the Geordie podcast?
Man like filly bare cringy!!!
loz is a producer on the pod??
im not a fun of Nandos, but im sure if i go with Chunkz, it might be my favourite place to eat ☺️☺️
YES GINGE IS THE LOML
Filly is too cringe. Wish chunkz did this podcast on his own
Is Lawrence the producer?
Raah I want Nandos now
You can’t be poor from the uk is one of the most stupidest statements ever made. Have some fucking respect for this country and the people in it. Coz it’s a civilised society doesn’t mean people ain’t poor. Be fucking grateful for the position you find yourselves in and be kind to yourself and others.
22:04
i love watching this especially at work 🤣
These guys ordering Nando's in the middle of podcast is extremely funny 😂😂
I came across ginge because of my son and I started watching him I knew he would end up with these lot 👍👍
That ending is class🤣
chunky is really tanking on the weight
I am not going to lie, but Ging got a bit brave a couple times
“The fact you disabled a bully kid” Chunks😂😂😭😩
Eating on a podcast, straight down the mic. Slapping lips. Absolute gremlins😫
Chunks got soo big again 😂
I hope angry ginge doesn’t go a snowflake, having mutual friends aswell he seems like a funny down to earth guy hahah
Thanks for the episode on my birthday 🥳 #14
Never knew Laurence Mckenna was the producer of this!
Get xduttinho on
the best episode so far
Nella rose sly pissed there wasn’t Nando’s on her vid 🤣🤣🤣
10:19 whose that behind the camera speaking he sounds so familiar
Big up Lawrence
no way yall fucken eat like that omfgggg
Is that Lawrence at the end who used to do podcasts with true geordie?
Chunkz was on fire this EP, ain’t laughed that hard at a podcast
Rah, it's hard to get likes this day
Icl this is the only podcast where I generally don’t zone out  and I’m constantly listening love it 😂😂😂😂
WHAT!!!????!! BIG MAN LIKE LAURENCE MCKENNA SHOULD PAUSE PRODUCING BE A GUEST HE IS THE G.O.A.T
Does anyone on the pod know how to eat with their mouth closed 😤
"Yeah I do yeah, they're called vegetables" has my dying😂😂😂
Y’all made me order Nando’s
Ordered a nandos because of you lot 😂
Best one yet amazing podcast energy between you man is beautiful fam oml
since when was loz producing on this
Lawrence McKenna in the production team , haven't seen him in ages
The mukbang feel to it made the podcast better
Nandos in not Halal btw brother they stun their chicken
the intro 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“U guys keep streaming man grind” had me finished
Chukz munchinator
nah i hope nandos was an ad because all carribean and af people know that, that mac n cheese is DEADDDDD! its a cheese sauce pasta ting 😭 yous need to try a REAL mac n cheese 😂😂😂😂
Love how all these guys admire jj thats mad.
That intro was cold😭
100% best ep
FIFA ain’t the same no more. Fortnite’s where it’s at
Mancunian accent stay undefeated 💪
3:18 chunkz saying wroetoshaw is so real 😭.
Best episode yet icl
Lmao when Filly said the "13th of march" I was like 'yo that's my birthday???' but poor guy was way off for Ginge
Nando’s Pod is the way forward 😂📈
Ngl I laughed so much but just 1 question did ksi ever get back to chunkz ??? 😂😂😂😂😂
yo for all the uk brothers and sisters out there.... RESPECTFULLY a burger is a red meat patty not that chicken sandwich they got there
Edeb daranaaa you can’t be chewing into the mic like that all moist and ishh
Nando‘s is the best restaurant everytime I visit London I eat there. So sad we don’t have it in Munich,Germany. They got the best sauces as well & I don’t even like chicken that much but nando‘s 🔛🔝
15:52 I can tell chunkz loves Nandos look how he's so concerned ahhhhh I love him 😅
This was the best pod so far! Ginge is a really good podcast guest. It’s sick to see how much filly has taken to him! Chunks is always funny! Podcast is gonna be massive within a year.   Big up lads (swear I heard Lawrence talk too so guessing he’s the producer) good work you lot ❤️
another great one.
The role playing gets me every time 😂😂😂
Wait wait was that Lawrence from True Geordie at 36:00 ?!?!
I’m only a minute in the video but I swear this is the guy that was really mean and horrible towards Madame Joyce..
why am I laughing so much just watching them eat
I can’t listen to a podcast where people are eating fml
Honestly so disappointed in Angry Ginge- what he did to Joyce was really terrible
Don’t do a podcast and eat man it’s so grim listening to smacked lips all the time
Will somebody slow chunks down.Bet when his order usually arrives he seriously questions why he would need a wife fr
ginge is jokes 🤣🤣😎😎😎
10:19, is that Lawrence from True Geordie?
Is that Lawrence in the background?
Philly chunkz and ginge fortnite
Need another Fortnite vid with dej Philly and ginge
10:19 is that Laurence McKenna?
to be fair, if i was in your position, Nandos would be my brand to push... hope the fee matches the promotion you have given them
This podcast is actually the best because they getting people on you’d never think would come on a podcast or even be in that area
Big up Laurence been time since I’ve seen him on anything
did I just hear a fart Whiles Filly was talking about his School Reunion?
UKs poorest would be some of Africas Rich  £12500/year = R 287 000 thats R24000 a month .  R6000 for rent / R5000 for food water and electricity / R3000 for a car , Now you have R13000 left over from your monthly pay 😂😂😂😂😂 Gingers mum was rich as fuuuuug (IN AFRICA)
Ginge in my opinion is hands down the funniest content creator on the scene right now!🤣 but those 3 together crack me up!!😂😂
The best podcast so far!
10:20 Lawrence McKenna is alive😧
Wtf, Laurence is there 😂😂😂
Get Sancho on!!!
Free Palestine. Ameen.
Do I hear Lawrence behind the camera
NAME A BETTER DUO CHUNKZ AND FOOD ....
I’m a new subbie and i absolutely adore the content ! You guys are doing amazing look forward to the pod all the time ❤
Chunkz was salivating at the nandos orders 🤣
OI GINGE GOT THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS ME WTFFFFF MY JAW DROPPED
51:03 disabled a bully kid yh? Good one chunkz
cool trio
Who else ordered nandos after seeing this 😂😂
Get dannny arrons in the next one!!
No way Laurence McKenna is a part of this !!!!
Respect to Chunkz on his take about Africa. I have watched so many idiots say things completely wrong about Africa after watching some dead news channels make a dead documentary 😂
Me when I get food🤣🤣❤️  9:34 ⏱️
This was a natural chemistry. Laughed bares
The role play dilemmas are my favorite part of this show!
w chazza shoutout ginge
it's ashame not all nandoes are halal
OMGGG ANGRY GINGEE HAHAHHAHA
my guys 💯
Is it me or chunkz is gaining a bit of weight?
Did I hear a fart in that video? Or was I bugging
Was that Lawrence from true geordies chanel?
Nah, Chunkz got me feening a half chicken and 2 sides now
IS NANDOS SPONSORING THE POD?
Hahahaha chankz moving mad😂😂
Chunky said "disabled a bully kid"😂51:03
Great video would love a part 2
Is that Lawrence McKenna I hear 10:24
1:04:09 not necessarily, the dad could just be older. He might’ve been 18 and the guy she likes wudda been 14 when the girl was born
Made me order food straight away 😅
Nahh tell me that ain't Laurence McKenna talking in the back?
Chunkz is big again wtf
Honestly I don’t wanna watch a podcast and hear chewing the whole time
this trio holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Lawrence as in True Geordies Lawrence?
Chunkz just came to eat😭😂😂
Kind of a dead podcast this time ngl
Ah today just worked out it’s Laurence from the Jordie podcast behind the scene
me and gine have the same birthday to the date and year that’s crazy I thought he was older 😅
😂😂😂
😎😎😎😎😎😎
is that Laurence?
Love the guests and how with the bigger names you guys make it an effort to steer away from the “interview” part of the episode after the first 30ish minutes and just kick with your homeboy talking on a mic.
there's your title, ginge don't rate W2S🤣
nothing worse than listening to lips smacking together like that
Need a food connoisseur channel from chunkz
The roleplay part Lmaoo 1:05:55. Too jokes 🤣🤣
The Mac ain’t all that
Is that Lawrence in the background?😂
Lawrence on production big W
is that laurence mckenna in the background??
chunkz looking like harry in home alone with that hat on
Chunks is a big scruff the way he eats
riff in the intro is so cold
Love this EP Lads!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loz McKenna’s part of production?
One of the best episodes the banter between yous 3 was unmatched. Had me dying throughout.
Anyone notice Laurence off True Geordie producing this ?
Munching noises were horrible icl. Had to skip certain parts
Full English  Roast  Shepherd pie  Bangers and mash  Fish and chips   My list as blind ranking, fish was last cause I have seafood
Chunkz smacking his lips like a farm animal is exactly what I needed… nastyyy ass 🥴
The last 5 mins of the show - hilarious!
would love to listen to the podcast without hearing your lips smacking togther 🤢
Literally waited all day for this.🤣
Is that Laurence Mckenna?! 😂 56:27
we now need a part 2
Get modeen on this podcast
you should order a different scran each video and casually review it throughout
you gotta get speccs on man
30th March is my birthday 😭
Filly the goat. He needs to bring LV in and talk it out. legendary pod request!
.
More episodes with ginge??
The best episode so far
love ginge. what a lad wish him more successes
Laurence McKenna behind the camera! What’s he doing there
Chunkz eating during the whole podcast is pure entertainment
So this is where Lawrence McKenna disappeared to 😂
Next on this pod get dave 🔥
Watching this at work before going to lunch 😂😂😂 man dem torturous bruv. Swear I wasn’t hungry 10 minutes ago
Nandos promotion team is smiling rn
Ngl chunkz looked way healthier before, take care please. Great episode!
was that lawerance from true geordie podcast speaking at 10 mins
Favorite ep so far!
The mac n cheese is so mid wait till u lot try it
CHUNKS HAS A LUST FOR FOOD 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funniest one yet
Nando’s has to be ordered now😍 pausing until it’s delivered
Best one yet! Ginge is the boy😂 💯
For Chunks his not playing games. It's just full on eating 😂
Isnt that lawrence from True geordie at 36:10 Long hair looks crazy
You know what this would probably never happen, but what would it be like if they had LV General on the podcast
Is that Lawrence behind the camera?
At this point im starting to think nandoes sponsored the episode but it worked because I fully just ordered the nandoes mac and cheese 😂😂😂😂😂
LITHUANIA MENTIONED RAAAAHHHHH 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
A wild Lawrence Mckenna makes an appearence - I'm glad he could bounce back from the previous dickhead he worked with..
Listening on Spotify I had to come here to youtube to say how much that wet mac n cheese is triggering me 😖😭 it's sounding MAD
OMG I’m so excited i literally just bought food and u guys did too!!
Suming to make up for last weeks👏
Chunkz is me when it comes to food. It makes me so happy 😂💙
Why are you platforming this racist after what he did to our black queen madame joyce, smh
Instantly the best episode so far, Ginge is a legend 😂😂😂
Throw the food bro
nAHH this is the funniest EP ever!!!! 👌👌👌👌
Why have u guys brought in this donut ffs 🤣
absolutely LOVE this trio
As an American I don’t get the hype with nandos, tried most of the menu and when I tell u British people don’t know how much good food their missing out on by just living on that island. The mac and cheese from nandos literally isn’t even on par with a day old mac and cheese from kfc 😂
10:27 IS THAT LOZ MCKENNA???
The way Ginge can just instantly match Chunkz and Filly's energy is hilarious 🤣🤣
Chunkz needs to learn to shut his mouth if he's gonna be munching on food in any future episodes 😂
elite ep
Cold into!
Is that Lawrence in production I hear
Nandos must be better in the UK i swear there is more variety or something
last time i had nandos was like 12 years ago
Angry ginge???? How are you already running low on guests… cmon guys
Sweet Potato Mash, Coleslaw, Peri Peri Chips, Peri Peri Rice, Butterfly Chicken, Double Chicken In Burger, Chicken Livers, Xtra Hot Sauce
w
Chunkz 😭 I do not wanna see ur food roll round your mouth 😭 Apart from that class guest again 💪🏽
Every week I look forward to this
Yainted yainted 💪
Is that lawrence from true geordie podcast 10:20 ?
Thought chunkz were boutta hook ginge for ordering the wrong scran haha😂5:22
Loved this podcast thank u chunkz and filly and love u ginge ❤️
I feel sorry for those in London. The best chicken they can get is a Nandos and it's expensive. I haven't met a single person down south who I've taken to eat chicken up north at half the cost who didnt say it was better chicken and better priced
Eating Nando’s when I haven’t eaten all day I’m wounded watching this🤣
❤️‍🩹🙏🏼
Get KSI on here, that would be jokes 😅😅😅😊
laurence from the TrueGeordie podcast behind the camera?
0:08 that one fly that won’t stop buzzing around your room at night😂😂 all jokes love you both😂❤
Chunkz needs to learn to eat with his mouth closed clapping his chops 🤮🤮
Best podcast ever Manshallah chunks and filly
Not having garlic bread for Nando’s is criminal
Actually really good combo. Please don’t do stuff with Danny, ginge is actually entertaining
This show will flourish with time they just need to keep pushing
Wtf is Loz doing in the background???!! Yessss… get him on screen
ginge should be spade as all Ferrel  cats idiot show for dummys like dummies for window book
Next speed 😊
Speed gang ❤
Is that lawrence mckenna??
Bro, it’s crazy as to how many times i listen to every podcast on repeat 💀
He’s not wrong about the W2S thing tho 😂😂😂
Abt to order Nando’s just cus of them
FIFA fell of so hard
🎉🎉
Should allow subtitles next time. These guys spoke too fast 😂😂
Great vibes all round
Unexpected but amazing guest
Before i even watch this im saying its the best one yet
I’ve missed this pod had to miss last weeks ep😢…..😏
Blud there is so much better chicken than nandos
Chunkz is so adorable man
Never been so early
I gotta go try that mac n cheese and that garlic burger.
Bro I swear chunkz’ laugh has asthma
Watching chunks eat>>>😂😂😂
is that laurence talking behind the camera?
When are you bringing sharky
They think they’re slick with the Nandos brand deal 😂😂fair play mate.
21:34 chunkz how is your stomach still hungry LOL 😂😂
Eating into mics...... Ugghhhh jesus
Love these pods, but I beg you eat beforehand. The chewing sounds are mad.
this is about to be the most banter filled podcast of the month
I am early 😂
is that Lawrence behind the Camera? what happeded to Geordie?
CHUNKZ ALWAYS KEEPS IT REAL - HE IS ENJOYING HIMSELF AND I LOVE IT❤❤❤❤❤
i don’t think this podcast can ever have a boring ep 😭
W Laurence McKenna in the back what a guy🤩
Why’s ginge everywhere but youtuber come dine with me
5:10 Filly in mum mode " No  you're having 1" so cute
Idk why this has so many likes
Nandos collab tho 😍
Not them randomly making a song😂😂  Great stuff
This pod made me hungry
Best Podcast
chunks and filly are genuinely such an amazing duo
It should have been Chunkz and Filly's Mukbangs
Banger 😮‍💨
Chunkz and filly make my week when they upload. Got me excited like a kid on Christmas lol

Yessssssss ❤❤❤❤❤
