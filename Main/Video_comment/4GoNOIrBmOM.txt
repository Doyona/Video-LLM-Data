Christian wood just doesn’t have any INSTINCTS on defense. He was always in the wrong place, never challenged shots at the rim effectively and was a lousy help defender. He’s among the worst defensive centers in the nba. Tall, long but dumb As a box of rocks.
#BleedGreen #Celtics #NBA
Allah is the best and loves you
SUNS fans low key rooting for every team that plays against the Mavs 🤣
I love these unis.
AMEN SPREAD THE GOSPEL AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:38 this was nice 9:16 but this is what you live for
Happy for my Celtics playing amazing Basketball.
WOW
Celtics putting on a clinic !
Tatum's block on Luka in the end was an explanation point on the win.  Mavs just had no defense against the Celtics
Please can the Mavericks trade Bullock… He sucks
Idc what nobody say Luka was ballin 3 times tops he scored from a layup the rest of the made attempts were jump shots that man was on fire
Tatum over Doncic. Defense is half the game and I can’t just look at stats with contested shots made because basketball is more than that.
wish they won the finals last year
Dallas MAVERICKS 112 vs 125 Boston CELTICS
It's crazy how unstoppable Luka is fr 💯
bruh. luca having a tough game because of his teammates being just a weight the whole game. damn.
Doncic is the Larry bird of his generation.
💯🏀
imagine if the mavs actually put effort into building the team around luka
Please put the players stats. At the end of the video
GSW VS CELTICS FINALS PART 2 😅
Celtic Green Paying Off
I was at this game!  It was an awesome experience as I haven’t been to a Celtics home game since 2008.
Ttdftygg
Luka nice but damn his teammates never get into rhythm..
😷😞
Celtics without injuries are clearly the best team
Dam Boston ease up on the mavs let ‘em breathe a lil bit 😅
luka maybe the best 1 on 1 player on the league. unstoppable with the slow moves
The Best
Remember when boston lost the finals to GSW on their home floor? Me too
Boston Celtics == The Finals Choker
JT and JB the dynamic duo of the league
That’s what a all around team looks like playing a team who relys  On one player
Man this is gay.
Doncic vs Celtics
Luka need 1 superstar
Hahaha Refs doesn't give fouls to the Mavs lol
That Smart Post Move put the Boy on Heelies
Marcus smart looking like a steve nash out there. Passes are fire
When Wiggins kids are growing so fast.
luka got 40pts 🤔🤔
Luca is the best player in the NBA but the Celtics are the best team in the NBA
Rtetfrfttegcccfgcfgccfcchvgjhkllhhkhhys🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Ads ikkatin. Niyon
Mark GET THIS KID SERIOUS HELP and you got some sure championships!!! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤯🔥
Mike breen is right, ''he's gonna need a lot of help'' doncic really needed. You look at his teammates. I mean the only  great teammates is wood and dinwiddie. The rest is trash and undrafted. How he gonna win a ring with that line up?
I think this time they can become champions
this is a Doncic vs Celtics highlights, wrong video ig
This game was awesome to watch live at the arena
JT is 24 and Luka is 23. imagine them at 27-28
I typically don't like women commentators but dorris burke is a legend... hats off
Luka is Larry today props to him
As much as I hate the Celtics them uniforms fye
Celtics are looking way better than last year.  I'm telling yall right now there's no team in the NBA that can match their offense or defense. Celtics are gonna win the championship.
Celtics won better team but luka MVP
May I see the real basketball game.
Nice uniforms for Boston
Dallas is just stepback flaily shots. Just take it to them all night and their vulnerable
GOOO
Celtics look siiiik.
Jayson choker tatum is only a season player. He's not good at the finals tbh.
Luka blocked by Tatum with 2 minutes left in the game! That was the statement of the game, the final nail in the coffin on this one.  Great game by both teams.
Crazy how Andrew Wiggins shutdown Tatum and doncic 😂
9:16 that block was to say, "this is for all every MF that rates Luka over me."
Dallas needs one lockdown n they’d be good. Can’t give up 100 in 3 quarters
Celtics looking like the team to beat this year. and how tf did Smart see Tatum at 3:40 ??
That was a good game tho C’s 🤝
Jaylon Brown is Dwayne Wade 2.0
Smh 😔 call the fouls ref! GG Boston but call the fouls
We traveled a lot but refs did not call it
Haleluca
Mavs are da best close game……………😢
Props to Tatum for the block and for an impressive game 37,13,5 and brown 31,4,4 🔥🔥🔥
9:16 Highlight of the Game 🤩
That’s how you close out a game🐐
Finals?
Luka was the best player but the best team was Celtics
This was literally spender dinwides and Lukas isos vs the whole Celtics. Goes to show you the difference a team/ team play makes in todays NBA.
I was slightly disappointed the Dubs resigned Wiggins. I love the Warriors but I thought adding Wiggins to the Celtics would have been insane as Horfords salary comes off the books this offseason giving the C's the cap space to have gone out and sign Wiggins. Thinking about Smart, Tatum, Brown and Wiggins and Williams as  your starting lineup is scary as hell defensively.
So it was Luka vs the Celtics.. get that man some help..
And very soon Time Lord is also coming back! Celtics nation Get excited. Happy Thanksgivings.
I am a warrior fan but celtics is winning it all this year, too strong
Luka is the Slovenian version of James Harden, the same type of play which will most likely not be able to win a championship
Celtics said not today! Whoooo!
Listening to the announcers without watching, you would think the Mavs won.  I had to check the score. They should think about taking dribbling the ball out the game as a whole entirely I made a new move. It's called a Demistep, you only take four steps to the basket
Ive been a fan since 07-08, but let me tell you this. This Celtics team were witnessing is my favorite Celtics team to watch since Ive been a fan.
can't be the best player if you can't defend the worst player! how are you great?
I was at this game it was amazing
Cs deadly this year 😈
I've said it before and I[ll say it again Celtics ARE the team to beat this season in the East!!  Luka is getting better and the day they can put up a good team around that guy it's over for the NBA.....he can dethrone MJ in my opinion!!
This could be a possible finals match up
Man,Luka always gets these high scores,every game, but happy the C's got the win. Rob Williams must be close for a return .
Wood and Green should be starters for the Mavericks. Wood second leading scorer and Green is the second leading percentage three point shooter in the league. It makes no sense not having them as starters.
Celtics are cooking! We winning the chip! We are destroying elite teams! We don’t even have timelord yet!
SPANKED
What time Celtics start’s
This man Luka doesn't work on conditioning because he just walks around the court and nothing anyone can do. That's ridiculous
What time you start today
Boston choker 🤣🤣 Never win FINALS 👎👎
LET'S GO CELTICS!!!
Luka style will be the detriment to him ever competing for a chip
Props to luka for backpacking his team but Tatum and brown went tf off also and the Celtics played better as a team
Luka a beast offensively but defensively he  that's why he isnt the best
Damn yall great white hope just padding stats lol 😆 😂
Tatum and Brown showing what a song of ice and fire really looks like. Playing like a team is what the game is about.
On every play Luka is creating an offensive foul. He’s shoving his body into defenders before shooting, or extending the arm.
@7:40 Luka carried. If Jordan Poole can't do it, then he shouldn't be able to neither.
I don't understand how Marc Cuban could be good with numbers, he only got 1 player on his whole team.
Luka got worked on defense in this game
21 to Celts 32 then then 28 to 43 where are the real highlight we want to see the runs and the score that finally stopped the run why are these clips put together like this
So many haters in these comments. It's refreshing in the face of all these social media zombies pandering for likes by entering into a ball slurping contest with every comment.   We need the negativity back to balance out all the pandering.
These Celtics are for real, can't wait to see them in the playoffs!
Luka is the best player in nba right now!!
Sheesh there's work to be done boy. Need some consistency from the role players but props to Celtics for a great display
Jason Kidd needs to be fired how is the only other person scoring   besides Luka and Dinwiddie not starting and getting more minutessssssss  Dude waits until we are down 10 to put wood in 😐😐😐
Luka is actually a liability on defense
Luka is best one on one player in basketball but he has the old James Harden problem.   No defense and iso ball
I see why the mavs haven’t been living up the hype. All they want to do is play iso ball with luka and dinwiddie. They aren’t wearing any defenses down by doing that. The ball has to swing around.
Reason they got smoked is Celtics are great this year and Luka tried to beat them by himself. By the way how is 1:09 a foul on Horford?
They don't need a coach. Finals experience coached them up hard. Think they roll any team in 7 gms.
Luka's fade is getting deadly
Celtics winning the chip this year 🥹
Celtics on a mission.  Tatum and Brown tandem too dominant. Can the Celtics repeat as East champs without Ime Udoka? Yes!
Funny how Celtics fans suddenly think Tatum is better than Luka just because they won the game today 😂. Luka is on a different tier he easily top 3 in the league. Tatum is not even top 7. They're on a different tier. Tatum is just a taller but less efficient version of Devin Booker.
Magnificent.. Congrats Celtics 🍀❤❤
Luka might miss the playoffs… and the Celtics always have one key factor that slows them down every year and that’s Marcus smart, however, as I always say if he is healthy this team is dangerous! Just stay healthy Marcus smart at least until the playoffs
Wait until we’re fully healthy oh my god 🍀💙💯
Dallas play to much one on one ball  they dont  have  it
Sometimes Luka defers to his teammates who don't knock down wide open shots .Luka is Luka's best option on most nights.
mah boy luka needs help
Luka is best in the world
mav mde a game out of that .. good to see celtics not choking like in the finals .
let's go Celtic's!
It's like luka doing all the scoring
Celtics balling🏀
Dallas's defensive effort is not proportioned to Lucas' team... They should be patterned their o and d to Boston and make it again to western finals .. Luckily they play against the best B ball C of the east to learn how they can change teams arsenals...
Luka is a ball hugger
Let's go.
Luka is just a monster lol in this highlights i can only see him doing those fadeawayshots
Dallas defense is nonexistent and has no movement during offensive possessions. Too much iso.
All I can say is Luka is too good
Signature night
Just watch Luka when he don’t got the ball to shoot every damn play look like somebody we used to know and love first name James 😂😂😂he low key kills the team every game they gotta sit and hope he pass them the ball when they ready for it 🤦🏾‍♂️
🎅💝
Celtics fans, you may have this year's championship team, Celtics are looking pretty hard to beat.
Celtics beat Grizzlies and Mavs by far. No match to them.. if warriors loss to the western conference maybe they will be the champ
Celtics vs Luka should be the title of this video lol
Wor cut 2022
The Coach of Dallas don't know how to rotate his player....
This is the Celtics year.  I think they will win it all.  I say they will come out of the East vs Atl and advance to the finals vs Suns or Warriors or Grizzlies.  I can’t stand the Celtics 😡😡 but I have to begrudgingly concede that they will get the chip this year!
That might have had something to do with Boston’s defense? Maybe?
luca is the best player of this game no one can handle to him
A Luka vs Tatum rivalry will be amazing in a couple years
Lazy hypothetical. Tatum is a two-way player with sweat equity in what Boston has become. He is a team leader who has elevated his game each year. One of these two has demonstrated the ability to adapt. The other … not so much. A person could easily argue that Dallas would have won another ‘ship or two with Tatum instead of Luka. Neither recent version of the  team has won anything at the moment, but Boston is the more mature team, and Tatum has a lot to do with the LEADERSHIP of that unit. Mavs seem to be a monarchy. Celtics seem to be a democracy. Strength in numbers on both sides of the ball. On defense for the Mavs, it’s 4 v 5 - advantage to the opponent. I’d trade Luka’s occasional steal for some actual defensive footwork, energy, and grit from him any day.
Offense for the mavs looked so dull, everyone standing around watching Luka score 🤦🏽‍♂️
Luka's teammates is trash compared last season. If Luka is injured they'll look like a lottery team I remember they lost to the Rockets at their home floor. For the Celtics their defense need to be better, I know Rob is not there yet but they need to solve that problem. They're going to need that in playoffs for sure like last season.
Tatum is a better leader than Luka
All this without the Time Lord.
LUKA DONCIC. A 24 YEAR OLD DAD BOD BUT DOMINATING A MUSCULAR AND 7 FOOTER PLAYER AT POST.  ALSO NOT TO MENTION MUCH FAST AND ATHLETIC. LUKA IS ONE OF A KIND. Also, If Mavs use JAVALE AND WOOD as their PF and C, Their offense and Defense would be much greater. Because look, Luka can score 40 and 30 all season but he has no help. Javale, a solid defender shot blocker and a dunker. Christian Wood, A ballhander scorer and Efficient Mid range at post, They got good Players and they bench Them both? Nah. IF THEY START DINWIDDIE, LUKA, BULLOCK, WOOD, MCGEE, THEY WOULD BE TOP 5 OR TOP 3 AT WEST. JUST SAYIN.
Luka >Tatum Celtics> Mavericks
guy commentator must be inlove with Doncic. lmao!
Luka >Tatum but Celtics> Mavs
By the looks of most match ups, Tatum is better then Luka.. if Tatum had  Dinwwidi, he would average 20 a game. If Tatum had Porzingus OMG the Cs would be on a different league.. debate is OVER! Tatum is better
It's fun watch this Luka Mavericks vs Boston Celtics
Too soon for Luka= 1st era Cavs LeBron comparisons?  Is this Mavs team even going to make the playoffs in an improved Western conference?
Mavs need to search for a second scorer. Darius Garland game is taking off since Donovan Mitchell came to Cleveland. I would love to see Joker play with luka I feel like the chemistry will be great and just surround them with shooters and 3-D
Mark Cuban please get Luka some REAL help!!!
Luka has to be taken out of the MVP conversation. His team is 1 game above .500 JT or Giannis should be front runners for MVP.
MAVERICKS FULL OF G LEAGUERS SMH
Just another day at the office for the Celtics
Luka super weak at defense 😂😂
I'm sorry but Doncic dribbling and then shooting is not good basketball.  He pads his stats but the good teams like Boston will beat the Mavs everytime with that strategy.
Why does Luka look like him
Timelord cometh ⏳🍀💪
Wow what a battle luka is incredible but tatum has more experience and the celtics team effort is absolutely great ❤️🔥
Tatum is Celtic’s Sole Survivor as he dominated the Mavericks, 125-112. 🇵🇭
It would be shocking if you could defeat a team with 2 stars and with only 1 star on the other team. This was expected.
mavs cant even beat the underman denver at home and you expect to beat the celtics?
I feel bad for Luka. Get him some help or get him out of there.
This is LUKA VS EVERYONE...One sided game.
Luka is new harden
Celtics are deep man
The Texass tRump Humpers LOSE!
Well Luka list to the Celtics.....Luka lost 😂😆😂 the other 4 player's aren't with a middle school team
Luka took more shots than the 4 other starters. I would be begging to get traded so I don't have play with him
Luka stays taking Ls.. he has 1 good game a week and gets a win and they praise him like he’s carrying the Mavs to a first seed in the west lol
Luka vs Celtics lol
9:16 crazy 🔥🔥🔥💯🥵🥵🥵
Doncic is not very good on d
LoL Mavs are chumps. Then beating the Suns was pure luck
The Celtics have a championship team here. Hopefully they boss up in the playoffs and garnish a title.
Half of this highlights were just mavs standing on d and luka scoring wtf is happening
Luka Harden
damn watching luka score down the stretch iso, while everyone touching the ball on boston..  As a warriors fan i like when luka ball out, like in that playoff series. sometimes let him get 40 shit and the mavs still lose
Is this type of basketball funfor the players? Eveyr play is a Doncic isolation, his teammates barely touch the ball. If Doncic sits out, its a Dinwiddie isolation. What is this basketball man, smh
JT>Luka been saying this argue w yo momma not me! Even if Tatum sold in the finals last season he made it there didn’t he? Also his first playoffs run he dunked on bron and took him 7games Luka just now getting out the first round last season n 2 of the wins in round 1 was w/o him!
Luka was being hella selfish that’s why they lost I hardly seen him pass the ball this game
At 6:27 isn't that travelling?
Too bad that Jason "He's only 19!" Tatum is just gonna end up choking in the playoffs
Luka is basically Houston rockets James harden
The day Luka gets a superstar partner, the league is in trouble.. that’s all ima say.
Mavs are so overrated man
I'm sorry but I'm confused who has the hot hand
The Mavericks are just bad. They can only beat bad teams.
🌮 Jay 4 MVP💯
Dallas needs to get rid of THJ, and Dwight Powell immediately!
Who got next dem boys in green D is mean and their high scoring points are scary
No match
Luka great offensive player, bad defensive player. People rave about his offense justifiably, but I don't hear much from people about his defense. I'm a huge guitar fan. It's like people only focusing on lead guitar, but can a guy play rhythm too? Luka, not so much. He's young, hopefully he'll progress. They say defense has a lot to do with heart, desire and effort. Look at how much better small Steph Curry's defense has become.
This should’ve been tha finals matchup
Celtics are full of studs this year. I haven't seen a team this good for a while. Very excited.
This was how my player played the celtics in mycareer
No denying how good Luka is. But how much he gets away with and how much he complains just really bugs me.
I see Jalen Brown fixed that handle in the off season
Luka would need a partner to match up with Tatum and Brown. Giving up 31 to Jaylen ain't gonna cut it fot the Mavs.
1
It's 2vs1 luka is so special bro
Brown is more efficient than KD
Luka's style just like James Harden's when he was in Houston Doesn't equate to championship level basketball
All this shows me is Celtics are a great TEAM and Luka’s surrounding cast is bad besides C Wood and Spencer and play C Wood more , 17 minutes last game against Denver is atrocious
mavs really be wasting another year of Luka... JKidd a great coach but theres literally so much he can muster out of this team that doesnt stack up against most teams in terms talent and skill.  Wood and Dinwidee barely makeup their "big 3" and whatever is after that is a huge dropoff
Man, I honestly feel like Luka's talent are wasted. If only he had a strong #2.
That was a statement block by Tatum on Luka, you can tell he wanted that match up 😤
They have suck great D!!!
The best team in the east..looking to take that trophy this year.
When everybody knows Stephen Curry wasn't around...... ha ha ha
Boring game
3:09 luka out there blaming his teammates instead of playing defense 🤦‍♂️ what a b**ch
Man I would hate to play with luka
Luca is the White James Harden just Bigger JT is the best player under 25 in my opinion and based off the evidence! When your top player is allergic to defense it doesn't end with a chip!
Love this team just waiting for Williams III we going to get better...
Luka needs another superstar who can play without the ball, KD maybe 👀
Jaylen Brown " 7 " underrated player future superstar this league 🔥🔥🔥
Great game CS,  Pinaglalaruan lang mavs .. Nice Celtic's Jersey..
It was still a Luka Show
the boston system is just elite… this group deserves a championship
GO, BEAN TOWN, GO!!!
9:11 cold
So who's the no.1 in the league today?.i remember the big king Kong fella from the bucks he's too windy talking🤣
Give Luka a player like Brown and it's over
Luka defense awful
man Luka was balling but all his points were off iso, everybody ball watching, if he gets a real offense it’s gonna be a problem. Celtics played a complete game, gotta give them credit.
That block by Tatum straight to brown for the 3 to cap it off nice game fellas
Luka didn’t even want to play this game
Lakas ng Celtics 💪
Luka need to stop Isolating so much the ball need to move more.
Luka is the MVP as of now, but the Celtics are a damn good team so props to them
The D of Dallas was too lazy
Is Luka human? I haven’t seen anybody really stop him yet.
Wala kung ganyan Luca Hardin, Westbrook din datingan mo.
I feel for Luka. He's gotta do everything on offense. He passed and his teammates miss, he tries to create with the kick-out and they miss. He's gotta be tired af.
Right now Jayson Tatum is the NBA regular season MVP.  Luka can score and pass but Dallas doesn't have good defense this season and they may make the play in tournament.  If the MVP were given to players based on stats alone both Luka and Steph would be in the conversation each week.
Why block out what is written on the floor in the Garden??  Yea i noticed its no there.  Get ready for the BOOM huh? lol
Dallas just couldn't do much for almost 3qtrs defense wise. Good game by the Celtics
I can’t believe the C’s had Bol Bol
3:45 Gsw
Celtics playin like their defending Champions fr
Pano gabahan ka team ni Luka tagal lagi bola sa kanya.
tatum obliterated luka
Luka Doncic is the new James Harden 🚀
CELTICS NEW UNIFORMS SUCK ASS
9:19 Ohhhh satisfying
To all the Luka Haters, here are some stats: +/- Dinwiddie was -23 Bullock was -21 Dodo was -15  Fg% Dodo 4/9 Bullock 2/6 ( thanks to full court pass or he was 1/5) Hardway Jr. 1/7 Green 1/4 In total 8/26.. So, at this rate Luka must have passed the ball atleast 30+ times to get his 9 assists..  So, stop hating and start watching the game!
Luka's Mavs remind me so much of Harden's Rockets. Same style of offense, same kind of results.
We can't play like this and expect to win against gppd teams no matter how many points Luka score.
The commentator said "no murray, no kojic" 🤣🤣🤣
Boston all day everyday
Tatum has become the best player at his position in the NBA and it's not even close...Plus he'll be first team All-NBA defense this season as well.
Luka just toying with all his defenders.  Celts won but dang, dude got stronger and more efficient.  His footwork and fundamentals jumps off the page for me.
Really want to see a seven game series between this two. Watching a finals series with my favourite team (Celtics since '07 lol) vs my favourite player (Luka) would be really amazing. Kinda feels like J. Kidd is starving Wood by letting him be on the bench as a sixth man or something. Maybe he'll be unleashed come play-off time? Who knows, but maybe there's something happening in Dallas.
Why is smart no on Luka? He the DPOY.. c'mon man!
That mavs team isn't gona get Luka where he's tryna go..they gotta shake that team up ..dude isn't even in his prime yet and already unstoppable
Luka
Bro JT and JB are him fasho!! And shout out to luka he a 1 man army
dd
Luka please pass the ball Lmao
This team is the best Celtics team since 08
Doncic and the mavs need to learn how to play D. Who cares if you score 40 plus points only to give it right back so easily
Damn complete domination....Boston is scary af!
lmfao that little back down fadeaway that Luka does is ridiculous. But holy crap is he god awful on defense. Tatum is the far superior overall player
l  like them  all  MAVERICKS AND CELTICS they are all good players  specially LUKA AND TATUM
Counted 20 Doncic pushoffs
great win by the C's after that disgusting chicago loss. i hope Jts performance here quiets down those who think he's not on the same level mvp-wise as luka. JT won this matchup and his team got the win. the only remaining test imo for JT is giannis. he's already beaten luka, ja, jokic, embiid, etc.
Luka the new James harden, Jason kid got fat lol
LETS GO CELTICS 👏👏 LETS GO CELTICS 👏👏
Luka is a no-show on the defensive side. He does no work on that end, so for half the game it's four Mavs against 5 opponents, and this situation will continue to undermine the Mavs. The narrative is that Luka needs help, but the Mavs have been fielding good teams. It's just that opponents can regularly take advantage of Dallas's compromised defense.
8:22 Where's the foul? Didn't even touch him, soft ass league.🤦‍♂️
While it's sheer preference, this is why I'll always take the likes of Tatum & Brown over Luka: they make it happen on both ends!
I hope Luka doesn't end up rotting in Dallas like Dirk did. I know Dirk won a ring but he could have won more
Mavs second best player wouldn’t start on this team. 😔
JT went LBJ on LD!
Luka got blown by plenty of times. He need to trade his defense 🤣
Good game and a solid clutch finish by the refs
Luka and Dinwiddie are the only ones who came to play tonight
Brogden such a perfect compliment to this Celtics team.
Doncic is great, but can be a black hole. Their offense can become stand and watch.
Mavs defence is painful to watch
Mavs should trade for miles turner
jayson tatum and jaylen brown= 68 points Luka doncic and Christian Wood=68 points
Get Luka some help ffs, man is the 2nd best player in the world and is playing with scrubs besides Dinwiddie
9:05 - Late call by ref only after Wood got vocal.
i hate marcus smart
Brogdon is that missing piece that the Celtics needed
Luca "whining" doncic
Celtics we going to the ship 🍀🏆
Choosing Powell to play more with Luka than Wood is such a disrespect to Wood's potential. J Kidd must start Wood and let him play 30 minutes at least. So disappointed
That block was like "Nope! I'm MVP" To be an MVP you need to play good defense also unless your name Steph Curry
THIS IS THE FUTURE
Luka needs help
Luka needs help.. he’s doing all he can
More playing time for C'woods!!
That block made my night!!
Told everyone Dallas overrated
Luka style is gona kill his ability to win. Guys was just standing around watching him on certain plays. That’s not gona win championships
Good game Celtics!
Doncic can’t wait to see the Celtics in the finals period
Luka hella stingy with the rock
The end was pretty savage. Tatum beats Luca one on one. Luca on the next series tries to take it to Tatum but he gets rejected. Then it cuts to Luca on the sideline looking pissed.
" luka cry again whahaha
You got three players on the Mavericks making plays… and no defense…
9:17 Two way player
What a disrespect block of Tatum to Doncic damn this celtics roster is so strong 💚
I'm tellin' ya! Luka knows how to put on a show in any arena. 🔥🏀🔥
luca doesn't share ball 🤣🤣🤣
Damn tatum called game with that block on Luka near the end. That was savage as hell
Holy Boston Cannoli!!! Normally I would be on my C’s for loosing a major lead but I’m fine with it because it didn’t come down to the last made basket like usual.
Good game Celtics fans... Boston was definitely the better team tonight.
Smart men those dimes
If a white guy is your best player your not going very far 😂😂
Luka on the Mavs is like having Josh Allen QB your Highschool team. The Mavs organization really is a mess. I can only imagine how fun it would be to see Luka with actual high level NBA talent around him. With just Brunson, it was a WCF appearance.
Bruh we got Michael Jordan in Dallas
dallas get it together or hes gonna leave.he doesnt even need much but this team construction ain't it. when you are expecting miracles game in and out your team is bad.
Blocked by Tatum. Jaylen Brown for THREE!  That sequence though 🔥
Dallas not Ready yet Luka is but Dallas is not
I can see playing Luka will be a real sweaty b.o. smelling experience 😒 As slow as he is... put a center on him and let him shoot over him all night😒
Celtics is the leader on defense........ luka concernd only on his stats.....blocked by tatum.......
Mavs ain't winning shiii just another regular season team
lol. lets be real... it was Luka vs the Celtics.
Mavericks will never win a championship until they find a team offensive attack. Luka is great, but everybody else just stands in the corner and watches. It's like watching James Harden with the Rockets. We already know that style of offence can't win a championship. Luka has to share the ball in rhythm and the Mavs need some real motion in their offence. It doesn't matter how talented one guy is, one guy can't out score a whole team.
Magaling si luka pero d nya kaya dipensehan ung kalaban nya kulang sa footwork
Luca needs to start involving his teammates or else.  He is forcing 2s while there are opened guys for 3s...
Mavs gotta make a big trade! time for THJ to go im sick and tired of these players getting big minutes and zero points!
1:09 how is this a foul when he was the one who initiated the contact?????
Mavs desperately need another scorer. Go get Jordan Clarkson
mavs have no post presence. they badly need a big man.
Luka should pass more to involve his team mates.
Im so fucking pissed because I benched Tatum, my guy popped off 😢
Finally a game where both teams fully healthy and both superstars from each team playing each other😅
Funny Tatum got hyped at the block. Luka had 40 pts on you. Lol. Relax
Score all the points in the world but if you can’t play defense you lose
Mavs rely to much on Luka, look at their highlights almost 75 to 80  percent Luka, Mavs need a dependable 2nd guy to pair with Luka or produce consistently when he is on the bench. Dinwiddie is a good player but not that good to be a 2nd man.
That sequence at 3:36 is what I called a "Very Solid Play".  Man I really missed "The Starters".
I would not be suprised if Luka wanted out of Mavs
That block by Tatum 💯🔥
Luka top 3
Luka should be doing too small gesture and say everyone’s tough when they up to his teammates
Luka needs some help. He's not going to win a championship with bums like Reggie Bullock and Dorian Finney Smith on his team. They're just not consistent enough for Dallas to win a championship.
The better team won tonight
Hard to watch
This isolation offense has a long history
Its an absolute disgrace on the level of hypocrisy being displayed.  Carmelo Anthony and James Harden both were heavy criticized for putting up big numbers but lacking effort on the defensive end.  Luka does the same thing, being a far worst defender than those two, yet the powder boy fanbase makes all the excuses for him.  Absolutely disgusting.  Tatum is a superior player because JT, along with Brown, actually plays defense.  Luka might be the worst defender in the league, real talk.
Brown and Tatum best duo in the league!
Rim protector on defense
Jayson Tatum: 37pts 13 Rebs 5 Asts 2 Blocks
Boston is REALLY good
Damn. Luka is too good. It's like he alone vs the celtics. Boston fan btw. The block was nasty tho
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown played very well tonight.
the celtics are leaps and bounds better than this mavs team man. the only guy keeping them in the game is Luka and even he couldn’t get them within 10 down the stretch. The silver lining for them is that the Luka/Wood 2 man game looked great. they need to start both of them. but even then this team is not a contender. boston 100% is though
Luka is my favorite player and omg did he do amazing on Offense but I gotta hold him accountable, HE COULD NOT STAY IN FRONT OF ANYONE!!!
Dallas is playing like houston back in harden era.
What a smart move!!!!!
Celtics have been impressive so far this year. Decent shot at getting back to the finals again if they stay healthy. Their ball movement and depth are especially notable. Luka may be great but the Mavs are mediocre -- and they aren't going anywhere this season.  Mark Cuban and his Nike Exec GM underestimated how valuable Brunson was to the team -- and made ZERO effort to replace him. When Luka gets double-teamed or has a bad game, they have no one to act as a playmaker. (Dinwiddie is NOT a point guard.)  Mavs could have tried to get someone like Brogdon -- a smart addition by the Celtics. Goran Dragic was begging to play in Dallas with Luka for peanuts --  and Cuban turned him down. The Christian Woods pickup was good but they just don't have enough quality players to go far in the playoffs. Lot of dead wood on the Mavs filling up cap space ... guys like Bertans, Hardaway, etc. who can't do anything but catch and shoot 3s ... and they aren't all that dependable at that.   The dim bulbs in the front office in Dallas means Luka will probably have to leave the Mavs if he ever hopes to win a title.
Idek the outcome of the game yet. Celtics fan my whole life. But I gotta say luka is f*cking unreal dawg.
You know, it would be nice if other players on this Dallas Mavericks team would remember that they're collecting a paycheck too besides Luka. I thought Luka played very well tonight against Boston, but his teammates played like shit. Reggie Bullock played like shit, Dwight Powell played like shit and Dorian Finney Smith played like shit as well. Dallas has the worst role players in the NBA. You can count on Luka and Christian Wood to play hard every night, occasionally Tim Hardaway Jr might even have a good game, but the rest of Dallas's players are inconsistent asf.
Damn the Celtics look good.
Celts keep proving they're trying to make another Finals run, the Mavs have had our number to, winning the past 3 meetings on buzzer-beaters, great dub 🍀
Not a fan of what I’m seeing from the Mavs.  Kidd May have to go.  Can’t watch any more of this shit.  I’ll watch Luka highlights once in a while.  Can’t take a full game.
Tatum, Brown and Smart what a good combo, I always amazed by todays gen of Celtics, they might be this year champion. The only thing they need to watch out is Bucks and Suns.
I believe in Joe Missoula!
Celtics r gonna win it all this year because of the fans that they have and the players and their just op and overall they have the best team because of that so good luck to them mark my word they winning it all this year
Bro luka basically kept the team from getting blown tf out dude was goin crazy
Lame D!
Luka overrated if you actually watch the game you see how terrible he is on defense he was -13 for the game is that good? everyone blowing by him like he’s a cone. Tatum should be higher than him in MVP race plays on both ends wins more games I guess defense and winning don’t matter if you put up offensive stats
Luka is my love hahahah
Friendly game ❤
Tatum beat luka but luka win mvp
Go Celtics!
Future is bright for the NBA frfr
Luka had a second star in Brunson—drove him away chasing personal stats, hogging the glory— Brunson’s thriving in NY, out of luka’s shadow—so’s porzingas in Washington—detect a pattern?
Proud of my Celtics for getting the much needed win! We needed the J’s to go off tonight and that’s exactly what they did. Really needed this after getting swept by Dallas last season.  Also, much respect for the Mavs and Luka. I want Tatum to win MVP but I wouldn’t mind seeing Luka win it either He looked like he needed help out there though. Similar thing happened to us last season when Brown dropped 50 in the season opener and we still took the L. But the mavs will figure it out eventually. I expect them to be looking for revenge next time these teams match up.
Dallas did nothing wrong they just cant match the real contenders.
Teamplay Vs. Selfish play
Nice ball movement and the offense follows from Celtics poor defense from mavericks
Luka need help
Imagine Lebron younger than Luka giving a better Celtics team the business. Now let’s pretend prime Lebron was losing to this Celtics team by this much and being considered the mvp despite not winning anything 😂 yeah can’t imagine it? Me either.
I’m a Celtics fan to my core, and watching Luka it sure feels like watching Bird. He definitely a player I enjoy watching ball out.
I might get alot of hate for this. But after watching 15 mavs games this season. I've come to 1 conclusion. Luka is extremely overrated. Everybody praises him. But absolutely neglect his  Deficiencies. Like his horrible defense. Horrible free throw shooting. Mid to poor 3 point shooting. And he literally has 1 move. I saw him do it atleast a dozen times in this game. If not more. Post up. Turn around jumper from 8-10ft. That's all he does! Tatums 37 was far more impressive to me than Lukas 42.  And not to mention. Ik all players get emotional when playing. But luka takes it to another level. Hes such a cry baby. When jaylen blew right by him and got the and 1. Luka got right in the refs face. No technical. But tatum got a tech a couple games ago for clapping? Tf?
Weird seeing Larry Bird on the other team.
ball hog luka
Ka bush
Who has set up Emi this why we see the truth someone new this Celtic season  Deja Vu.
Luka is playing out of his mind with his G league team
Luka needs to involve his teammates! They have more shooters!
If the Mavs don't pull off a trade to make this team better, Luca leaves for a championship somewhere else!!!
Tatum put Luka 💩 on the backboard 😭😭😭
No Luka 4th quarter magic this time! Though that 4th quarter was still a heart attack. Nice win Celtics. Happy Thanksgiving
i feel bad for Luka man....
Tatum really wanted to show up in this game against Luka, but Brown was smooth and efficient played really well. All starter for Celtics had a double digits scoring and Brogdon was good again off the bench. Celtics is a good team, seems like every lineup works and can't wait til Rob Williams get healthy.
A super star, a MVP and a good leader makes everyone around him better; more importantly makes the team better. That is Jason Tatum. The other guy from the Mavericks, not so much.
Tatum made a statement this win even after being doubled most the game exciting to watch two MVP caliber players clash, luka is unguardable no matter what the defense they would have sent the double if they didn’t have the lead all game
Luka is unreal. Props to the Celtics for a solid dub 👏
So the mavs celtics game gets 1080p60resoulution, but canada's team gets only 360p resoultion for its game against the nets? WTF NBA You wonder why Raptors fans feel disrespected, these are the kinda reasons why
Luka is literally the only player scoring 😂 Its so sad to see him carry so hard and for Cuban not to bring anyone after 5 whole years
Luka Wont Ever Be Mvp With His Defensive Play.
Good bounce back win ☘️
Luka again out performs the media's hype train runner up to mvp.  When will the media stop the bias
As a mavs fan, I feel bad for luka doing everything just to win a regular season game. If only they make those easy open threes or at least someone be aggresive getting into the rim, the game would be completely different. But yeah, this is a make or miss league. GG, Celtics.
JB smooth!
Team ball vs iso ball a white guy who is a ball hog will never translate in this league. Just a bunch of stats and will never get a star to play with him
What a block 🔥
MVP rankings( as of now)  Jayson  Luka Giannis  Donovan  Steph  SGA Ja
The Boston Celtics are 14-4🟢⚪️🍀
Yeah people need to understand basketball isn't a game of 1 no matter how talented a player is a team of 5 always gonna win...it was an easy win for Celtics. And for the Mavs they are just wasting Luka's potential if they would have players to rely on other than Luka they are not far behind the championship
Jayson MVP
It's not a Celtics game without Celtics fans hating on Tatum for some reason. Hey if you guys don't want Tatum my Warriors will take him.
Tatum Building into MVP form
This might go unnoticed but I’m Artist Worth The Listen 🗣🔥👂
Why does Kidd doesn't play Luka and Wood more often. Their chemistry is always there.
Let’s gooooo Celtics!!! Tatum >>> Doncic!!!☘️☘️☘️🔥🔥
juss give tatum tha mvp already…
Let’s go Celtics
Man props to Luka, there's just no stopping that guy. He's the not the most athletic player but he's crafty and skilled and just gets to his spot. But... the better team won. Go Celtics! ☘
Luka might as well go to Denver with Jokic, he just can't keep carrying the Mavs like this
Tatum block on Luka is all I needed to see
Celtics are beasts of the East!
#bostonstrong 💚☘
What a block JT
I though last year mavs won the nba championship like suns vs mavs
Jaylen Brown's game so crisp.
Bruh
Jayson has signature wins against Ja, Jokic, and now Luka. Defense is also on point. That last sequence was the highlight of the season. Go Celtics!
I think we all know who the real MVP is, and that's not he cry baby lol baby 🍼🍼🍼
Way to early
Just simply amazing basketball by the Celtics. Held it down on D, dominated on offense, and got the W. Props to Luka and the Mavs for their performance also. Let’s go Cs! ☘️
Best TEAM in the League vs one of the best players in Luka…  I’ll pick Team every time.
it’s always been Luka Doncic vs whoever is against him. he might as well sit out this game.
Damn
The Js performance today is amazing I cant wait too see tatum and the Celtics win this nba championship  one day!
What an L for the Mavs
I seen Al Horford wife …GYAT DANG.
