Are there any laser weapons on the unsc
0:04, i wishing that Spartans team will be add in halo wars 2 when he gets a upgraded
“WHAT ARE YOU, RETARDED?! MOVE!”
Halo infinite mobile please 🔥🔥🔥🔥
How about you guys. Uhm idk. Finish the campaign??
Pfff i Play HALO REACH
Where’s halo wars 3?
“All Units”
Honestly I don’t even care about the multiplayer anymore. I just care about the story. Hope they release new games in the future.  I just want the story to continue.
Man and hear I was thinking wow, they actually are making the story DLC I have always wanted bridging the mainline story with halo wars. Nope just some cosmetics. What a waste.
Get tactical marines
DumpToolException_3196.bin This error occurs when starting the game Halo Infinity Multiplayer, when starting the game, this file appears for 2 seconds, after which the game crashes. The button is running, goes out and the play button lights up again, I have Windows 10, reinstalling the drivers does not help, I have been with this problem for 2 years, I need help!
I wish there was a fan edit of the whole series with all of this
Spirit of Fire in Campaign ??????????????????????
Make SOF come to the next Halo. Bring us a work of art, like Halo 5 was when it dropped. Y’all shouldn’t have stopped its updates.
CAMPAIGN DLC!
Now update the campaign
These trailers are garbage - all you do is highlight the armors. Show us new gameplay, maps, and shit that actually matters. You're just sucking the fanbase you have left completely dry for a dead game rather than promoting the game to build a true community. Classless.
too little too late
Think about it, this is pretty much the og season from fortnite into halo
Happy for this addition to the game
Wasted potential for a real cool DLC ...
I hate how hated and underrated this game is. People don't even give it a chance. 343 could probably do better, that's right. But it's hard to make a game free to play and then add no microtransactions. Atleast it's not pay to win. Love the new update tbh, keep releasing this
I swear in the first few seconds of gameplay and you hear  ON ME!!   and shortly after that he says   ARE YOU RETARTED.😂😂 I swear 5 seconded matk😂😂
Fix your hit registration u shhht devss
Hey 343 give us the red team armor kit or there armor
Bring the military police helmet back
ODS… ODST… ODS… Helljumpers… ODST Standing By
Supply pad complete
Thanks 343 for ruining my favourite franchise of all time I hope u lose the rights to halo because u are the worst game developers in the world
Bring back seasons
Yet still no playable Elites
Dog water game. Unstable. Performance issues all around. 343 devs are idiots.
LOCAL WALLETS, ALL WALLETS.
Now that it's out. This is 1000% a shop update and not that much of a content update. Those suits in the shop could have been put in the operation but 343 chose not to. Come on now, do better.
Oh wow, another pack for MP... great...😅
Looks like fire!!!  How much are they charging for it?🤬☠️
Please playable elites😢
Soo... no news on where Spirit of Fire is huh?...
Boring glade I'm not there art teacher 😒
ngl, this update sucks
I got a white quick question. Are the other items free or do I need to pay for them?
Tonight is gonna be LIT
The part where you added in the Halo Wars characters in the campaign DLC was awesome. Oh wait a minute, more pointless skins & armor?   Nah, I'm good.
Halo Wars 3 hint????????????????????
Give. Us. The. Hayabusa. Helmet. Please. 😭
Yo guys who remembers when you would unlock armor in halo vía just playing and doing well and it wasn’t locked behind a paywall after buying a full priced game? Seems like 343 is turning a game we grew up loving into a soulless cash grab
Let’s pray that the next update gives us free color pallet customization😂😂
Spirit of Fire, the precursor to the first day of the war.
Y’all are literal scum
I was hoping this trailer would give us an update on the whereabouts of spirit of fire if they're dead or still fighting
yippee! - more cosmetics... i guess working on another game mode or implementing co-op campaign is a dead cause.. this is probably why I can't pick up a controller to play Halo anymore.
All units
This update would of been a lot cooler if, ya know, I could actually earn the armor by playing the game instead of busting out my credit card because most of the cool shit is behind a pay wall.
Fix ranked, it absolutely terrible now as a solo player
The Spirit of Fire OST totally should of been the new menu music for this season, but aside from that I really like what this season has to offer. Well maybe also the elimination of Legendary Firefight was also upsetting, but that's the only other thing.
Where are assassinations?????????
What a shame…it’s a store update and a 20 tier pass…damn
Guys, infinite wont open for me
I want them dragon shoulders so bad. I missed the tenrai 2 and 3 events
Woah a shit ton of cosmetics. Definitely improves the game more than a pve gamemode similar to the firefight in halo 5
Your game is getting worse and worse every day and it is becoming stupid
The fact that we see the halo wars characters as canon is a lot already
Can we not have shop offers in the trailer please? Other than that cool trailer
Talk about taking advantage of the fans
Aww man, can we have some campaign DLC please, people want it, please
Preparing us for the new expansion perhaps?
Finally brought the stanchion to mainstream halo, lesssgoooooo
ALL UNITS
I never played halo wars but in my opinion after halo 4 everything kinda went downhill especislly now
Can someone tell me how to get teammates that are actually good, no hate to the game or anything, and im not bad or anything but can someone tell me where I can find teammates who don’t just stand in a corner doing nothing all match  Please help me
Thank you for making the game half unplayable now I get stuck in loading screens constantly my game keeps crashing after you added one map and armor core
crazy how half the pass was Icons, and 7 of the nine mk4 sets, in the mk4 update are still in the shop
Hässlich wie die Nacht. Ich mochte Halo noch nie.
Please Halo Wars 3!  Y’all makin’ enough money from the shop items! Let’s goooo 🙏
Waiting for the next halo game so this shilling microtransaction hell can end
I'm going to enjoy tea bagging the shit out of these premium players 😃
Clickbait
Only 12 800 credits (128€) to have all the customisations for the new suit.... I missed the day when 3 armors for halo 4 cost 2.99€
Play to earn your armor with effort.  ❌  pay to have armor. ✅  Nice Marketing 343...
🔥
Congratulations 343. You have trashed halo. It is currently unplayable.
Wow more skins!!! So excited for this!
dont care make an actual good halo game for once
So when are we going to get new guns and vehicles?
Cosmetic Update
I was all excited to play after taking a 6 month break and then I realized I can't earn those armor sets...
Stop taking my coating from other season ik i had  new dybasty and when u added entrench u took my  money even tho i bought i bundle and made my stuff i unlocked in the campain now locked  tbis bs heck take a halo fan there money as stuff they earnd for  i wish i had the noble drifter but u guys sadly vaulted it its weird tho ididnt see that event at all back then when i was on everday in febuary
👎
Those store prices are a scam.
I do not know who is more legendary, the Spirit of Fire or Capitan James G. Cutter and his crew.
i want halo wars 3 !!!!
5 bucks for a gun skin? 343, you truly deserve all the hate you get <3 fix the game instead
ALL UNITS
I was really excited about the Mark IV core this season. But you removed the battle pass, threw one basic set into the operation, and then listed EIGHT armor sets for the new core into the shop at effectively 20 usd a pop because you list them at prices that force you to buy the 2000 credit bundle. I can't defend this game when you turn around and try to squeeze every rat cent out of your player base. Its constantly 1 step forward with you people and then 2 giant steps backwards. Your increasingly aggressive monetization is morally bankrupt and will only continue to anger your loyal fans and signal to your naysayers that they're onto something after all. Shame on you.
Would be so down for a halo wars 1 remaster or style game
¿Wort, Wort, Wort?
The enemy is making a SCARAB
Havent been following for a while is people really getting hype over things they gonna have to buy for $20+
Lmao Pierre sucks. 343 sucks. Give the franchise to someone else already. Half effort cash grab baloney update. Garbage product.
I just wanna see HW2 spirit of fire and Spartans meet up with Masterchief. It’d be a glorious dream team and I hope 343 runs in a similar direction.
Cash Update 29 lets gooooo!!
MAC…away
Still dog shhhhhttt. Imagine increasing the prices of overpriced items in a game that's no longer being supported other than bare minimum lol f u 343. Let someone else run this already
THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. Now add Campaign DLC that involves the Spirit of Fire. I would GLADLY write the story for you! I have a ton of experience writing, and I have LOVED Halo for decades.
Dude you can’t even call this an update, no substance every single item in the store is OVERPRICED it’s pathetic, ranked is completely chalked, no new maps for popular game modes like BTB and Squad Battle. Why wasn’t the store items put in the battle pass and then just bring back vaulted items to the store? I can’t play this game anymore I was loving it but my hope is gone now. Not sure If I’ll buy the next halo if they can’t even get their stuff together on infinite. It’s either you guys have no work ethic and don’t take pride in your work as developers or Microtransaction OOPS I mean Microsoft is forcing you guys into a money grab situation. It’s just sad this game is the perfect setup for something great just keeps getting pooped on 😢
Nice battle pass but im still waiting for the playable elites and the assassinations
BRING BACK HALO WARS!!!!!
That's awesome finally we get Team Spirit of Fire Spartans & Team Omega Spartans in game to fight alongside the UNSC Marines & the ODST Troopers &  Master Chief & his Blue Five Team & now we just Noble Team & Team Agent Locke & his Spartan Team Osiris to join the fight to win battle against the Banished & other threats out there that are unknown yet! 😃💯
Don’t play this trash, they didn’t add ANYTHINH
343 we need an only pistols playlist please 🙏
This is not halo😢
All this makes me think of is:  "All units." "Helljumpers in the tubes." "Spitting up MAC rounds." "Yes sir...? ...Rolling out!" "Spartan reporting."
The Mk IV core is awesome but I hate that the Mk V and Mk VI are just kits and not cores
Mi primera temporada de halo. 🤩
Lol 343 trying to cash in on nostalgia because they know the old days of Halo were superior
We will never have a game like halo 3 ever again, and that makes me sad.
I’m wondering if 343 will drop extra shoulder pads for the mk4 examples being right shoulders with red team emblems and the left shoulder that Jerome had
just give us Halo Wars 3 and feature space combat as the concept art leaked online showed
great!!!
*cmon 343 you know what we want why wont you just give it to us as an early present*
One of the worst updates by far. 8 brand new armour sets are exclusive to the shop and only one is available in the 20 tier “battle pass”. At least add one more set into the pass to get it to 30 tiers. There is no reason why they couldn’t add more than 1 set into the pass. Abysmal service this season made just to squeeze out a quick buck with fan service and nothing more.
THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR IN GAME PURCHASES. WHAT IS THIS INDUSTRY
Im just dropping this request anywhere I can. Gen2 style cosmetics like helioskril/hunter/centurion plz?
I went back on Halo infinite to see what you did I was surprised when I now noticed is it shoulders are now on all armor cores and then I looked at everything else and was disappointed I saw the battle pass I saw the original or the coolest assault rifle in the battle pass so I played two games to get it and that's when I realized the only thing I wanted was a bonus that I had to pay for fantastic  my disappointment is immeasurable and my day well night is ruined And I like how not a single person is complaining that now only two pieces of armor are available on all armor cores can we just have one armored core with all the armors or is that too much to ask for you know not enough profit for you
0:44
Please just do one last update to halo wars 2 so it’s not such a broken heap of crap. So many of us love the game and still play it even though it’s a struggle with all the crashes and glitching.
They had armor customization more or less perfected in Halo: REACH I really don't see why they couldn't leave it at that.
The Spirit Of Fire never dies, and neither do Spartans.
This is a slap in the face to every halo player.
Very good that armor shoulders are unlocked between cores. Once they unlock them all I'll actually try playing again - I like my customization!!!!
Meh
Worst update ever besides the free armor core lol, nothing but skins and 1 map, 4 months to make this
The Mark IV armor base is literally perfect.
"All units"
Skins?  That’s it?  Yeah MK4 is cool but it should’ve been in the game years ago. That’s the big update I heard about?
Finally, my most favorite Spartan gen. Armor will now be available to use.   “Haha! LONG have I awaited for this!”
Im so excited
343 Foooked the fans once again… They just need to make a NEW HALO GAME!!
Great content. Why is 90% of it pay walled in the shop? Would you like me to cut my wrist to give some of my blood while you're at it?
Whish they put this much effort in single player content. The main point of Halo...
Saw this an thought nice a new rts like halo wars then saw its another shitty BP for infinite
someone cooked here
This game is still around?  I loved halo but I couldn’t wait 2 years for a fully fleshed out game anymore
actual continuation of that story when?
For fucks sake when is there gonna be campaign content and not just cosmetic shit for a multi-player that majority don't even play anymore
*REACTOR COMPLETE*
All this is cool and all, but with the amount of stuff you guys threw in the store, you could have given us a full season instead!
We NEED Halo Wars 3 !!!
Halo is so out of touch no new maps just hyping season passes and the store this is why halo is dead
Where the infinite campaign?
That sniper skin is nasty
You gotta lower those prices if we got no battel pass anymore
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Using the Halo 5 Sniper sound? What's up with that?
کونی وچه
The premium Omega Team items finally make Spartans look like the Halo Reach concept art. But it's premium... so for the wait it took, I'm questioning how warranted that is. I can commend that it's the right direction, artistically, at least.
oh wow more crap that cost money
Can anyone play the update yet?
The hunting continues this season ❤❤
what time does it launch though?
Why didn't you make the Stanchion a new weapon you nerds>
If only the player numbers were higher
It's not a trailer it's a commercial for some cosmetic garbage...
I think I scene that sniper at community stage cosplay tournament nice 👍
Awesome!
Bring new halo with great Kampagne
Now this is epic
I haven't been this wet since noah's ark
So it's just cosmetic garbage? 343 never fails to disappoint.
>no new KOTH firefight maps >more cheater infested PVP bullshit >game whose PVE population sustained it not pandered to  I'll pass.
I have a "NEED" for HaloWars Spartans!
Look I would not be getting hyped over this. Halo infinite trying to cover there own mistakes that were made and should have been fixed when the game came out. You will probably still have to buy the skins instead of earning them by playing the game, which is what is supposed to happen. I would not put to much hope in halo infinite being good anymore.
do we get premium if we had it before?
Serena or Isabelle AI?
Did I do something wrong cause I'm trying to look for these things? Are they released yet or not
Now we just need a Halo Wars 3, please 343 make Halo Wars 3 a thing
Can we bring back ordinance drops and loadouts already
Does that mean the halo wars 2 sniper rifle is more than just a standar S7? Because that weapon showcase looked like it
Ohhhh you bitches. Ma5 behind the Premium pass. Well, you've got my cash then.
Gassed!
Just funny they try to advertise and hype what the game should have had from the start and dont get me started on the store
what time?
Peak
What time does it drop
LFG
Another piece of garbage with boring the always boring cosmetics. You should do something against the cheaters because the game it's flooded of them.
MK IV PEAK
ODST IS IN THE TUBE
I’m confused y’all. Apparently this releases 12:00am on January 30, it’s now 8:24 and I don’t have the update. Do they mean 12:00am Jan 31? If so why give the date Jan 30 what the hell.
idk what new management you guys got but you guys are killkng it! great work
Looks like dog water
Give me more story ..dammit..
I could hear Steven Rippy's magnum opus song in the background love it!
Why are you killing a game that is in the top 10 on Xbox!? Abandonment of the seasons = death of Halo Infinite

hey 343! want the update to be EVEN BETTER??? add what the ladies like
ltzgo
Seems dum
Okay but where’s all our old halo guns and content like firefight SURVIVAL not king of the hill even tho it is enjoyable. The last thing they should be doing is making more games why not double down on this sandbox perfected did we just forget about the EMP launcher and the spartan laser??  All that work poured into a new engine just to only add armor n not guns 😂🤦🏽‍♂️  Fk customizing for a sec we have oh so many B.s effects  MAKE INFINITE ENJOYABLE TO PLAY FOR HOURS THATS THE POINT OF BEING W CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE U GOTTA MAKE THE OTHER SIDE JEALOUS If I told my friends I play halo consistently (I don’t) they’d laugh no one in their right mind plays this more than 5 hours maybe within a single week the game is BORING So far they sucked everything we loved outta halo but hey there’s flood armor, Promethian guns and knives with no flood/promethians OR assassinations 🤷🏽‍♂️  that’s enough right?  No We all want infinite to be better Reach brought so much swag to the table and even with a reach battle pass as their first pass they still aren’t anywhere near reach 🫤  loadouts? GONE  Assassinations? GONE   Ez grind items? Long gone.  I preferred the supply crates w random items/assassinations over corny passes they keep tryna be like other games and it’s ruining their roots/origins  Just bc u changed companies doesn’t mean you gotta change the roots look how much reach made compared to how much it cost to make off being a 1time purchase only NO DLC, EVERYTHING EARN-ABLE GAME.  These gaming companies just ain’t getting it the few to break the recent years gaming cycle are the ones who make it and idc about a item shop but BRO THIS PASS TAKES FOREVER TO COMPLETE, 7 games for 1-2 tiers is ridiculous and torture especially since they barely have content/new guns to fk with  Oh yeah and get this  We earn less exp doing pve than pvp like wtf be grateful I even have this garbage installed  Humble ya fkn selves 343 this game still ain’t going anywhere I can’t even apply my weapon skin off a weapon I pick up off the floor that’s embarrassingly stupid even other companies got that part right.
I hope someday we get some campaign DLC or some sort of a multiplayer PVE story, with the firefight mechanics they have now they could absolutely make a playable story.  There’s so much potential to essentially bring back Spartan ops to carry the multiplayer story forward
Want to know what would be good for a Halo Wars 3 trailer?  Cutter: “Attention Pelican, this is the Spirit of Fire. we have you on radar. Identify at once.” Pelican Crew: “Spirit of Fire, this is Sierra One-One-Seven.”
Where’s MY F-ing SPARTAN LASER….!?!?!?
Calling red team Jerome: Reporting Dougles: Reporting  Alice: Reporting
What will happen to campaign can someone say
343 finally figured out 80% of Halo (single+multi player)   another 10-20 years and they will become just like old bungie
lisening that theme after long time i havent heard was kinda special and bring such a good memories
Man that MA5B Assault Rifle never gets old, just need to add the classic sfx it'll be much cooler
Great, so new cosmetics that everyone will be wearing and one crappy new arena map? Game is now dead. F off 343.
Presenting their lame shop as always.
343 Shitdustries
When does this release Australia time anyone know?
That little sting from the halo wars piano at the end hit me HARD with nostalgia
4 years to late
The Mark IV looks as beautiful as always! I hope we get an officially released wallpaper of 0:15. Seeing groups of uniformed and unidentifiable Spartan's is always something I love. Adds more mystery and a little intimidation when you can't tell who they are.
I loved the halo wars series and I hope we can see a third installment of the series
It’s a shame the game sucks and is dead.
big deal. >_>
halo wars 3 when
whack
Yo, izanagi's burden is in the game!
Thx for the bday gift halo
The Halo Wars 2 love is strong here 🤩🔥💯
Is the Stanchion just a different model for the SRS99 or is it a new weapon?
The only thing they can do.. trailers. Can’t deliver proper stories.

We finally get master chiefs core 😄
What time is the update!
So you guys working on some new campaign stuff or just this multiplayer dross...
Ye nah, the armour looks so terrible with all those additions. Why would they do that?
Bello è....bello. Ma Halo Wars 3? Anzi, mi accontenterei anche di uno spin-off fps incentrato sugli eventi di HW. Lineare ovviamente.
The piano goes so hard.
Spartan on deck
Lord have mercy on my wallet
When i saw the start of the video I literally thought this was about to be HW3 Trailer
Love that OG Halo Wars Piano at the end
Man, I remember getting hyped for trailers because they offered new content in maps, game modes and expansions on story, not just skins that still aren't as detailed or diverse as a game that came out 13 years ago.
0:48 was so confused about what it was showing but then i realized it's just not showing the fluff cus even they know it's terrible lmao
The customization updates are SPECTACULAR! But, when will the Falcon and Brute shotgun come to the game???
I want hot barrels people!!
Lowkey wasn’t expecting that “are you retarted move” 😭
So, no announcement on additional multi-coatings? Are they not CUming?
Those Piano keys at 0:45 👌
My only dislike is making the classic AR a purchase
thats right. you gotta go back to old halo games from other companies for good content. 😂
Was really hoping in new vehicles and weapons with this upcoming season
Existe algo más precioso que este evento ? No lo creo :') ❤
Half my units? All units How many units? All units 3 units All units
I was hoping for a DLC or story update with SoF.... :( tht tie in wud have be amazing.

Halo Wars nostalgia bait is my favorite nostalgia bait. I'm hooked in. I wish they would give us Serena and Isabel as A.I. though.

I might have to hop on
Halo now so pathetic
Can wait to use this armour.  I remember seeing artwork of this armour with a commando helm.  Ever since i wanted to use both together.
Is this a remake of Halo or just a add on to it??
Holy crap is this a game from 2003? 😂😂😂
Ya echaron a perder la saga principal y ahora van por wars, bien hecho 343i
I though it would reveal SoF dlc story line, oh boys was I so wrong.😅 Go eat krak grenade, 343
Doubling down on cosmetics I see
OMG WE CAN NOW EQUIP SHOULDERS ON DIFFERENT ARMORSSSS YASSSS🤣🤣what a fking joke this game is, in Reach we could fully customize the armor piece by piece meanwhile this shitty company is making us pay for pre made color pallets and unlocking shoulder custumization, wake up people they are messing with us and laughting at our faces, remember Reach!
Why is all the hype surrounding this game always just about cosmetics?

You guys did it.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT STOP SUPPORTING THIS GAME! This is all I have wanted from Halo Infinite and more! Huge well done for the team!

Anyone else how hard the soundtrack was on the cross core shoulders
343 is to pussy to give use a proper story DLC and would rather pump out microtransaction garbage
how does every other halo have more customizations then this game in 2024 not only that it takes yall a month to pop out a 20 tier bp with 1 helmet and then sell us a mid armor set all season cause you know damn well that armor will be in the shop all season😭
And ppl say Infinite still sucks. It's getting old with them haters
Soooo does that mean if I buy the premium for one, they all get it after this season? Or its just like how the others?
Outstanding. Well done, 343i! 🫡  I have to say, though. With the amazing Mark IV being added, I'm really, _REALLY_ wishing the recent Mark V bundle was also implemented as a fully-fledged Armor Core... 😖
Low res, plasticky models
Teased me hard I was hoping for a new game
The spirit of fire out lived the infinity. Hope it stays that way!
I hope one day you stop wasting time and resources into cosmetics and actually create more CONTENT
Imagine playing halo 7 and then you hear this music 0:03 with the spirit of fire 😂. Epic
0:05 " ARE YOU RETARDED??? MOVE!!! "
Mark 4 didn’t have shields
Looking good guys!
I absolutely hate them for still demanding 500c for the og AR model. Aswell as over 3000c for all the armor stuff. Fock'n money wolves!
💵 💵💵💵💵
Let us customize our own colors!!!
The fact that they decided to name it "Spirit of Fire" but STILL PURPOSEFULLY left the CU29 in there makes me believe that it's very intentionally and is subliminal messages for "see you in 29" for the next game.
343 you've out done yourself  Appreciate your work
:0
First cross-core helmets, now shoulder pads?  They're doing it well! If this keeps up, almost everything can become cross-core like before! :>

I really wish they would patch in co-op split screen campaign before they stop updating the game..
YES!
Harvester upgrade complete! Lets hop they don't mess this up
This is a certified W for 343 keep it up 🔥
For the love of god  SHUT DOWN 343 INDUSTRIES  SAVE HALO!
IM GOING FRICKIN INSANE!!!!
An Ma5 are model and a Stanchion sniper model? That's honestly amazing
ALL UNITS
Only if they gave us the real stanchion sniper
Halo is 💀
Im hype asf
hearing the halo wars soundtrack made me feel some typa way. underrated part of the franchise fr
I hope down the line the customization for prosthesis also gets an update where they can be individually chosen for each each armor core rather than applied across all, I find that I don't like how some of the prosthetic limbs look on certain armors (chimera looks terrible with them)
Can we get some actual content instead of just skins? Like, idk, new modes, single player expansion, spartan ops? If this game is supposed to be a live service for the forseeable future then give us a reason to come back.
this is the first time the MK IV armor is playable which is funny considering it was what Spartans used for the duration of the war, with the MKs V and VI only being introduced at the tail end of the conflict
It sucks that this isn’t getting that much attention
For years I dreamed of seeing the OG rifle in a new game. While it may not have its storied 60 round magazine, it’s still a great addition!
HALO WARS 3 WHEN!?
All units!!!!!!
So instead of it coming to campaign  we get this?
So this update is literally just cosmetics?

Wish more players come back to this game. The multiplayer is awesome and way better than H2 & 3. Yeah I said it, take off the rose tinted glasses.
Buy. Our. Shit.     and never question how we destroyed your favorite series.
And you will never ever get to own it, just be in perpetual subscription servitude!

Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!, ya quiero que salga!!!
Stanchion and Classic AR? now we are talking
I cant believe this is all Halo is boiled down to now, Skins, Seasons, premiums and passes 😞
It will be better if there’s a campaign DLC related to HALO WARS
Anyone wanna bet this trailer got more views than the show?
The Spirit Of Fire theme hits so hard! I played Halo Wars so much on Xbox back in 2009
That’s it huh that’s how halo dies
Goodbuy money in my wallet
Hearing the Halo Wars soundtrack at the beginning was orgasmic.

Mejor nadota. ¿Cosméticos? ¿En serio? hermano están matando Halo cada vez más
Finally the stanchion in a game if only it was the gun and not just a skin. Although the gun would be broken
dont care didn’t ask plus the reach armor core is inaccurate
Omega team is in the store :(
After this update has had it's time to breath, any chance the community could get a Mk VI core to get all 3 gens of Chief's armor and maybe also the Mk V (CE) chest from Reach for Mk V (B) since that was never added here?
i want halo wars 3
Exactly as I predicted, just a load of cosmetics and no real new content except a terrible looking map. Imagine still playing this garbage game.
Wow! shoulders cross cores 3 years later, let's go!!!! XD
Before Halo Wars 3 comes out. HW2 needs a MASSIVE update- SGT JOHNSON- •Every garage built already comes with vehicle upgrade level 1, so now only requires Vehicle upgrade level 2 and 3. •To replace the Mantis, Gauss warthogs(fully upgraded Gauss Hogs already able to be made once a garage is made are able to roll out.) •Scorpions (Instead of having colossus’s now has classic Halo Wars 1 looking in appearance and sounding scorpions that have no need for a canister shell upgrade as they all already come with it and a health buff. •No longer has Victory Surge, now has a passive leader power that can be unlocked with a leader point to have classic halo wars 1 Cobras able to be created in the main base but are very costly , 600 a pop with blue supplies and 200 yellow power. •Fireteam Zulu- name of the new replacement leader power, where Johnson Uses captain cutters Pelican circle Close air support and gets rid of the emp Mac blast. •Johnson as a leader no longer has a mech suit but now comes as a normal marine looking hero holding a battle rifle (same way Sgt Forge was in HW1 Campaign without his warthog holding a shotgun); and now has the ability to get in and out of one of his scorpions by pressing X on a scorpion , (like how Jerome can do with his command mantis) or he can just garrison inside a bunker drop. Johnson can be upgraded to where his battle rifle does more and more damage. His first upgrade is still his Y ability- beacon.  COMMANDER JEROME- •Mantis’s instead of warthogs •Colossus’s instead of scorpions •Replaces “Victory Mine”, with “Victory Surge” stealing it from Johnson. (Pretty much takes what I took away from Johnson.)  SERINA- •Now uses FrostHawks instead of Hornets  ISABEL- •Uses updated plasma rhinos that lock down and and are Excellent against shielded opponents for her scorpions to attack such targets easier now getting rid of Kodiaks due to her obtaining old data once held by Serina (no longer held by Serina) such files given to her by professor Anders about the prototype Plasma Rhinos. •now uses classic halo wars 1 ability, “disruption bomb”, where it blocks out all leader powers in the area.  SERGEANT FORGE- •replaces Grizzly battalion with a Halo wars 1 style fully upgraded carpet bomb that does mass damage to ground troops and small vehicles. •still makes grizzlies in garage  CAPTAIN CUTTER - •Close Air Support now replaced with the Emp Mac blast that Johnson once had. But now where the blast can be upgraded to a total of 4 Emp Mac blasts to be shot at once, like it was in Halo Wars 1 being much more lethal. •odsts take longer to load but costs less population and now cost half the resources to drop.  DECIMUS- •No longer uses Brute warlord hero •no longer has Decimus drop as a leader power, Instead Decimus himself is the only hero made in the war council. • Decimus now uses the Halo wars 1 Vortex ability called HURRICANE to replace the Decimus drop leader power, just as the brute chieftain did in HW1. The ability is not timed it only ends when you end it or if it stops on its own being it depletes your yellow power resources when using it. The ability gets stronger as more units are pulled into it until you end it in an explosion … All unlike the “vortex lightning” that already exists where it simply hurts and stuns enemies and lasts only a few seconds. •Decimus no longer has his Y ability to call in glassing beams and no longer has energy shields but when fully upgraded his damage and health alone acts as if shields were pointless anyway. •Now can upgrade his wraiths to become Iron Clad wraiths, pretty much the grizzly equivalent of wraiths slow moving having an equal amount of health and one mortar shot is as powerful as a grizzly blast.  ATRIOX- •Atriox’s leader power Eradication now has increased initial damage where the beams are now red in color instead of blue. •Has two brute heroes now,(similar to what Decimus once had) both being made in the temple,  • first hero is Atriox’s chosen exactly how he is already with a now slightly higher rate of fire no more energy shields but dramatically increased physical invulnerability where the stats of the shields are just added to his health.  • second hero is the warlord that was once Decimus’s hero now with 10% increase to hammers damage dealt to enemies.  PAVIUM •Liche now starts off coming down from the sky with a energy shield same way retriever sentinel does, Liche beam now temporarily stuns a target when firing on them similar to how the Liche in halo 4 stunned the mammoth. •Pavium hero can heal himself with the restoration drone that follows him, but the heal is very slow and not as effective as for example the Hunter captains heal.
Halo Wars 1 but awesome it was a huge part of my childhood love the crossover

We need Cap Cutter or Sgt Forge to be a battlefield Ai like Mister Chief.
Your payed content has no value to me.
I was hoping this was a halo wars 3 trailer. Nope just skins
Halo infinite is the best, halo infinite forever ❤!
I just want the real halo 6 continuing right after halo 5 Guardians not halo infinite 😤😔
Yawn, so close yet light years away.
My boy Jerome saving the day❤
ALL UNITS
My favorite ship of Halo, and now, a battle pass of Infinite, definitely a new buy adquired.
so no new maps, thanks for nothing
Cool designs 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so what are the lore implications of this? SOF randomly shows up in zeta halo? i imagine even half strenght they could beat the banished with chiefs help of course
ALL UNITS 🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯🗣️
I wanna spend money on this game, I wanna download it again. But in Australia all o get is husky raid and firefight. During the day I can’t even really play. Most of every playlist are dead.   They’re working on another Halo yeah? What’s the point in spending money in an area that’s a dead game. It sucks man.   Can we stop focusing on cosmetics. I just want maps and content and playerbase.
0:39 FINALLY, STANCHION MY BELOVED
ALL UNITS
Halo infinite is the best!
Are these bot comments?
ALL UNITS
Man it really sucks Omega Team is in the store...
Any actual content or just armour for a first person game
If we get Halo Wars music on the main menu, i swear i will cry
Just the shoulders, huh?
Halo infinite multiplayer is at its peak as one of the best multiplayers experiences of the franshise. Yes, microtransactions sucks, but we still have free rewards that look equaly good as store items. This game has a lot of customization like reach
This looks so sweet 🥰
Disliked the video, because it's just a fundraiser to sell skins and not a trailer about gameplay and new stories
I GO. YES.
giving me season 6 mcc vibes idk how to feel.
One final season and one final run of the game. You will be missed.
Did y'all just not do the other MKIV shoulder? There's the big one, then the small one with lines on it, and I haven't seen that one at all. Huge missed opportunity if not.
Lmao the cross core shoulder debut is kind of funny as if it's a revolutionary new thing to the series
Well let's try it
Take note 343. Red dead redemption 2 is not free to play, it's over 5 years old, the multiplayer is a buggy mess, yet it has a massive player base. That's because you literally get rewarded for everything you do. You can even earn gold instead of buying gold with real money. It also has a free ranking system and you unlock free items every time you rank up. Even just walking you are progressing towards a reward and xp. Same with halo reach, when you kill grunts in the campaign, you're getting credits for it through commendations.  I wasn't born yesterday, i know what makes a good video game. Halo infinite is just a game to sell cosmetics. It's literally just a store. Some of us ain't dumb. We know what you're doing. Shame on you.
I like how they call theese trailers, when it's just store items.
As neat as this is I do feel like this was a major missed opportunity to include Serina as an AI for our Spartans.
MOVE IT LEATHERNECKS
I'm glad this game gets the love it deserves
Im convinced the new halo game is halo wars 3
The minute this update is out on my Xbox and finishes the update for it I'm grinding just to finish the entire pass cuz this is everything I wanted in Halo infinite since the very beginning Halo Wars 1 had a very special place in my heart Halo Wars 2 has a special place in my heart seeing the iconic Mark lV armor return it fills me with uphoria and dopamine
Prep for pod launches!
It's actually a little hard to see the cosmetics in game because of the outlines kinda obscure them.
It’s so good to see the community talking positively about an update for once. The last season was great too. Thank god they changed management man.
PEAK INCOMING 😎💫
the gun skins are nice, but i was expecting a new big team battle mode like warzone from h5.
오랜만에 헤일로 워즈 하러가야징~~
Question. Why do the cosmetics in the customisation menu look detailed but in-game they look flat and low poly?
This is the closest we’ve gotten to 343i using good Halo music in ads. NOW GIVE ME MORE
Awesome
The way the opening shot mimicked an RTS camera had me f**ked up! I need more Halo Wars
I’m so glad they’re giving halo wars the attention it deserves, even if it’s a small event
Looks pretty good. Now fix my aim assist..my reticle shouldnt fly up into the air after i get a guy to a one shot. Y'all realize I'm fighting literal aim bots with my xbox joysticks. F me right.
ALL UNITS
Omg omega team armor
Well there goes my money
Aight this is sick
I haven’t played Halo infinite multiplayer since it came out, is it worth it nowadays?
Honestly I'm really excited
Now stop going behind our backs and lower the store prices to something reasonable (again). And KEEP THEM THAT WAY, thank you.
I hope spirit of fire is the main menu music 🙏🏽
ALL UNITS!!!
Was waaaaaay to hopeful this was gonna be a campaign expansion too
Can I earn my credits back with the new premium battle pass?
Infinite exists to be a software that sells skins. Silly for me thinking there would be new genuine content for the game I paid for.
Halo wars 3 confirmed 👀
Call it nostalgia bait, I don't care. This looks awesome, and I can't wait for tomorrow.
ALL UNITS
That top down view at the beginning of the trailer   PEAK
ALL UNITS!
I wish we still had narrative cutscenes and a story for the multiplayer.
HELLJUMPER HELHELHEL HELLJUMPER
PLEASE ADD THE FALCON SOON PLEASEE
Cross core should've just been there day one. Next Halo better not have cores.
When will the 3 new Big Team Battle maps be coming to Matchmaking in Halo Infinite? 🤔
YO THEY SPIT FIRE WITH THAT RETURNING SOUND TRACK
ALL UNITS
THE HALO WARS 2 SNIPER MODEL 🤩
Freaking epic, One step closer to full cross core 😬
Meh, Cosmetics aren't enough to bring back the fans and ogs 343 drove away
10/10
I love how the first shot looks like you’re playing halo wars with the top down view, I thought it WAS Halo Wars 2 gameplay until I rewatched the intro, nice touch.
ALL UNITS
I wish this was story DLC. I just want to finish the fight
Was really hoping for a surprise Falcon or Mutilator drop. Damn
Will the new map with the camo room be available for ranked arena?
Mk.4 AND the classic assault rifle my wishes have been fulfilled.
Man... 343 be cookin as of late 😳😁👏👏🤘🤘
Take care of those elites… HE’S MINE
This is quite interesting to see, I wonder if Xbox is cooking up a new halo wars 3
nice that the stanchion gets a model but no M6D magnum
ALL UNITS!
wow!  more useless crap!
Nothing worth my time, and I'm not good enough to enjoy the game. Ranked is too sweaty.
Meanwhile HW2 doesn’t get support anymore
THIS IS TOO AWESOME! Thank you, 343, and heck of a job by the team that makes these trailers!   ALL UNITS. I AINT GIVIN NO ONE A PIGGY BACK, but I will break my piggy bank for this! YOUR ALLY HAS SENT YOU SUPPLIES, or will as soon as he gets paid.
Reduce the max amount of players on lone wolves to 6 or 4 i believe its 8 rn which is too much, literally spawn get naded  and one shot or you fight one person and someone is already shooting you in the back or spamming nades before you can evade to se yourself up for another kill.  Or you're getting triple teamed by brs.  Limiting the number of players would definitely balance this out, and make the game mode more enjoyable
Just give us Halo Wars 3, already.
these are some of the most "spartan" looking spartans we've had in a very long time
All Units
This Operation looks sick, and Spirit of Fire is such a good name for it. They should definitely name a starship that in the Halo anthology...
ALL UNITS
Man them shoulder look like they are not even part of the game
That's cool and all, but uhh, when's the colour system getting fixed so it doesn't feel like crappy warframe but minus the good stuff?
This is the content we need to keep up, on theme with halo, not goofy stuff. I'm more then happy to spend money on any sort of cosmetics because it's diserved for this. Just perfect ✋️😔👌
The Halo Wars music got me tearin up
(ATRIOX) yes run little demons!
THE STANCHION?!   No way.  THE STANCHION?!
ALL UNITS
i LOVE IT. I CALL THE MARK 4 ARMOR!!!!
When will we get weapons
Omega team looks sick
CU29 UNITS!
Finally. An AR model that isn’t ugly
HARD!
Maybe the spirit of fire will come back to war against the Banish on Halo.
When does the update drop? What time? I live in New Zealand so it’s already the 30th for me but I’m assuming it’ll come in about 12 hours
Remember what this game could have been, rather than the way it is.   Vote with your wallets. Give them nothing more. This is eye candy to entice you. It isn't really the Spirit of Fire that you know and love.
Okay okay i'm installing infinite again This is pretty cool you got me
I need dragon shoulders and jin-roh helmet back in store please 😭❤️
The Spirit of Fire and her crew deserve better than this!
Infinite has been such a let down. Zero story DLC and just aesthetic micro transaction content all the way though.
Wait does this mean the Spirt of fire would possibly be added to the campaign?
Wow.... more cosmetics...
I would have never thought they would actually put the scrapped Omega team armors is the game. Hurray!
Mt wallet is about to be screaming after seeing that omega team bundle 😂
Does this mean we’re getting an update to the Halo Wars 2 servers?
Nah halo you’ve got my attention with Omega team. Amazing decision. Thank you for finally bringing them to us
All units, get ready for combat. My favorite Spartans are here.
Paywalling the classic AR model lmao nice one 343...
I'm sorry the stanchion!?!?!
Halo Wars 3 - when? 🥲
It’s beautiful  I’ve been watching this for 5 hours now
Are there new maps, or this is just an item shop update
sniper sounds like H4 😮
I would love to see new variations of firefight soon if we can't get a campaign DLC <3
Halo one day will have battle Royale?
😀
People are hyped about the idea of this update, not the update itself Lmao. There’s literally nothing here to be excited about.
Yall are really hype for some skins 😂
Omega team armor, take my money
AÑADAN MAS ARMAS😢
Amazing how we've become so jaded that being able to equip different shoulders makes it to the trailer...
A STANCHION MODEL WHAAAAT
Outside of the Spartan armor nothing else was good that new map sucks we need more older maps
Hype   Infinite is up there with my favourite Halo's
DUDE please keep the support for infinite going just when it’s getting SO good
While it's a shop bundle, I'm surprised they even did Omega Team's armor
They know I need that AR skin, battlepass purchase confirmed
The fall from grace is real
Amazing, you are making a full different gun and surprise, is just a model for the regular sniper 💀
Can we get Serena as a suit AI? Lol
343 Knocking it out of the park again with these dope and masterfully edited trailers! Hats off to the team behind these hype trailers! Keep the great work coming 343!
Why does the background song sound similar to the main soundtrack of Pacific Rim?  They thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
Your "battlepass" is a disaster. Just get rid of it already.
People have been asking cross armor customization ever since the game came out, there is nothing to be proud of here.
What time (depending on the various time zones) does the new update drop?
Halo Wars soundtrack was a nice touch
ALL UNITS
This made me tear up.
Welp...as soon as the game was getting good and they were going in a solid direction they pull back. Im getting flash backs to battlefront 2 EA and it makes me sick.
OMEGA TEAAAAAAAAAAM!
bruh, next halo better start with this and the blue team armors from H5.
Omega team? Let's go  AND an almost all tan armour coating, massive dub
now we just need Halo Wars 2 on steam
It aight. Tbh
Que tanta gente pague por skins feas que ademas otros juegos te daban de base o conseguías jugando me parece cutre 😂
Ok, I’ve bitched a lot about the shop… but the omega team bundle might actually have the best chance of getting my money if it’s priced reasonably.
It's a damn shame 343 don't use the classic Halo musical motifs anymore
Weird how it used the halo 4 sniper sound haha
Beautiful stuff
ALL UNITS
Nice to see Halo Wars get some love and in such a beautiful way too
Wake up master chief, halo just dropped
Yes, to all of this.
Love this..but where is the falcon, where is the shotgun with gravity hammer underbarrel, where is any new content? (Other than skins and 1 map)
I just peed a little looking at this
I know what halo needs... more skins!!! This franchise used to be as iconic as Mario, but I believe battlepasses will bring us back! Good job, 343!
Thanks 343. ❤
This is AMAAAAZINGGGGG
the Halo Wars theme is amazingly awesome. I wouldn't say underrated because everyone knows how awesome it is. Brings me back to simpler times.
I’m ready, how bout you?
Please don’t call it “CU29”🙄
Its like. If you just followed Bungie's Art style the first time. You would... I don't know. Have a juggernaut of a game.
5 years. 5 long years. That's how it long to take Halo back.
here i was hoping for an update on the Spirit of Fire and if it has returned to human controled space witch is why the armor is here ore if it arived to zeta halo to help the chief
What if, instead of just skins and new guns we got some little operations missions that go with the lore of the skin. It would be cool playing a short little campaign that gives a little introduction to the skin's lore. Those little halo 4 missions were fun.
0:05 "are you retarded? MOVE!" lmao! I love halo wars.
next update: grifball?
Bring back vaulted items
LETSSSS GOOOOOOOO 🎉🎉🎉
@Halo please tell me this pass costs 500 credits, I've been grinding out the lone wolves pass in order to be able to get the sic new AR model.
The only thing missing is being able to unlock Serena as AI.
When are we gonna get campaign dlc???
I still can't justify spending any money on this game with the Mark V shop BS, prices and the coating + cores system, but I definitely can't resist finally hopping on the game when this releases.    There better be some Wars music in-game to make me cry hahaha
Can't wait for an armor upgrade tomorrow.
Where my gen 2 armour
ALL UNITS !
How do we get the Evolved MA5 weapon model?
I swear 343 is going from zero to hero. Every update keeps on getting better.
Good skins, 343❤❤❤❤
W HALO 🔥
Bruh the lack of the left shoulder piece 🙄
Noooo las armaduras del Omega Team se pasaron qué increíble
YO IM FINE WITH HAVE THE RED TEAM AND OMEGA TEAM ARMORS OF SPARTANS II (and if you analize it we also have the spartans III armors that appears in halo divine wind; they are with the spirit of fire too)
That Halo Wars music just hits like a brick of nostalgia
no one cares for that crappy show but the mark IV still being one of the coolest looking Armor sets in the franchise
New "Content"  Cosmetics...  please where is the actual content?
First 1000 comments within 1 hour.
Tryna make me spend money 😭
sooo? no new mode, no new weapon?
I dont get something, is the battle pass free and only the first level is premium, or is it gonna cost 1000 credits and we gonna have a full Premium Battle Pass?
Waah! No story content! Waah! No playable elites! Waah! sbmm!   Bro shut the hell up and just enjoy something for once.
Hell yeah
God i really want Halo Wars 3! Fell in love with HW1 and HW2 and I can't stop playing the campaign missions. Please 343 make HW3!!!!!!

Hear me out:  Mrk VI helmet and the Ahalha shoulders on the Mrk 4 base.  Instant Halo 4 Master Chief.
OMEGAA TEAM LETS GOO AUGUST LOOKS SO GOOD
WHAT IS THIS? A BASE FOR ANTS?
So like… cross core shoulders and more things to buy? Lmao what a joke.
Gotta love piano at the end.
The fact they just ran with the CU29 is wild lol
"This is spartan group omega if they want a war we'll give em war"
I love that they’re bringing back Halo Wars stuff. We still want Halo Wars 3!
I'm a sucker for Armor collars...I want that so badly
ALL UNITS
Still no playable elites
bring assassinations back thats all i want
What is that music? Please stick to the OG Halo style, it differs too much from the Halo poetics.
They f'd up so bad by not having the Halo Infinite story not be about the Spirit of Fire and Red Team showing up to fight the Banished with Master Chief... the entire Halo Wars 2 story set it up perfectly and then they just scrapped it and forgot it, like 343 just keeps doing.
I am pumped🤩
So thats why you guys didn't make a season 6... All battle pass armor will go in the shop. Greedy has always atleast i still have enough Microsoft point to get some stuff.
anyone else hear “ARE YOU RETARDED? MOVE!” at 0:05?
I DID NOT EXPECT THE STANCHION.  Definitely picking that one up

Rip servers
I’ve wanted this armor in game since I first played Halo Wars when it came out. I know what I’m gonna be rocking from now on.
We have Jorge at home
Now we just need that Spartan Jerome campaign DLC
That sniper model is sick
There’s hope for Halo wars 3
ALL UNITS
343, if you’re ever gonna replace the master chief in the story, make sure it’s Jerome. He’s a Spartan II and he’s just as capable as the master chief.
Ik what im doing tomorrow after work XD
Well, i guess i have to get the premium pass dont i
I Bet that the spirit of fire is gonna be in the story cut scene or in the next halo
Love it ❤
When r u guys continuing Halo Wars 2 storyline?
"HUNT THEM DOWN" "Immediate evac requested" "FIND OUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM" "Douglas stay with me" "AND BRING ME ANYTHING" "Douglas" "USEFUL"
Stupid. Just give us halo wars 3
Finally. The mark 4 is my favorite armor core!
Where Jerome
OMEGA TEAM SKINS???? Leon, August and Robert actually getting some recognition, holy shit. 3 Spartan 2's that are still alive but nobody really talks about
ALL UNITS.
And again, only cosmetics, no PvE content nor story DLC. Won’t reinstall the game for that.
Oh god it’s not an fps
343 is so lazy to make new weapons that it only adds them as models on existing weapons
I really thought black parade was about to play at the end of this 😂
Fireteam Omega bundle has my wallet on god
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
SOCORRO, A MUSICA TEMA DE HALO WARS! 😍😍
oh GOD THIS LOOKS PHENOMENAL
Was not expecting Omega Team and that sniper model. Also I dont know who made that promo image but they absolutely deserve the biggest raise.
ALL UNITS
okay that little intro where they make infinite look like halo wars 2 is pretty slick
I hope we get falcons and the rest of the weapons we were sapost to get.
Hale Infinite : Marketplace first, game last.
GIVE US A HALO WARS 3 PLEASE 343!!
GAUSSS SNIPER IS CRAZYYYY
🆒
ALL UNITS
My dad’s middle name is Jerome. Can’t make this stuff up.
YOOOO THE GAUSS SNIPER RIFLE!!
*ALL UNITS*
The top down prospective looks so cool
To bad these items aren't unlockables ingame. Just gotta buy it. Then no real incentive to play
Halo wars 1 was a gem 💎
All units!... prepare!
MARK IV!!!!! 🎉
Coooooool!
ALL UNITS ALL UNITS LOCAL UNITS ALL UNITS
*Please 343 I want a future game with Red Team and Omega Team!*
Espero con ansias esta operación!! 🎉
we want campaign expansion packs
I hope this season brings to light how much the community loves halo wars. Bring it back!
HALO MEGABLOK ARMOR! I've been waiting to see those toys being added to the game for so long!
bit of a shame its not a Halo Wars 3 trailer, releasing that alongside mark IV is a miss tbh, but its not bad, core looks great, kinda trolled us with the music tho and the gameplay in a Halo Wars style lol
EQUIP SHOULDERS ACROSS ALL CORES. Yay! Another feature that should have been there at launch
I haven’t seen a stanchion model that good since the Misriah Armory mod got Fallout 4, holy shit! Also, that combat evolved MA5B just looks so damn sexy
And yet still no new weapons...shocker.
Question: Does the Evolved MA5’s flashlight actually work in game? Is it functional? 🤔
I knew all the cool stuff will be locked behind the store. 😔
Just wished they kept halowars out of this
I need new weapons and story dlc
I love this game so much, so good now just needs a little more love weapon wise
Halo Infinite tying into Halo Wars is beautiful! I wished we saw a direct story between Halo Wars and Infinite seeing as how HW2 introduced the Banished/Atriox.   Can't wait for this operation. Hopefully we get a Halo Wars 3 someday <3
Can't say Im not hyped
Gives us a steel chair like the one Jerome used to fight off the Flood in that one comic.
I WANTED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHH ITS SO BEAUTIFUL I CANT WAIT
That armor holy
Here waiting for HW3😢
A trailer for microtransactions? Oh boy!
I need that stanchion weapon model. It’s about to make my sniper rifle 2 times stronger
When we are useless to Microsoft we will not say anything but there will be signs. The game.
now people just gonna want halo wars 3 even more wtf give me game pls
Age of reclamation unlock
ALLLLL UNITS
The next halo game will be Halo Wars 3
I’m gonna hear the voice of god say all units
Awesome season hope we get a Halo wars 3
Okay 343. You listened to my suggestion about the sniper being give a Stanchion skin. Now. GIVE US THE MA5K FOR THR AR
I am SO mad that the classic AR is paywalled. Stop monetizing nostalgia, for fuck's sake
Definitely buying omega team, let's hope it's not overpriced like the flood bundle.
A L L  U N I T S
Seeing omega team makes me so happy
OMEGA TEAM SHOWN! RAAAH
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This is Spartan Group Omega, if they want war... We'll give 'em war!
Rally point set
No new vehicles is a bit of a joke to be honest
Halo Wars 3 please! Damnit!
All units
This game isn't dead yet? With the abysmal story and a lack of a multiplayer player base for sure I thought this game would be dead by now
Think I might actually go and do a hw1/2 play through again
A stanchion eh?
What! A reason to play Halo again? INCONCEIVABLE!
Never let dieing in the line of duty ruin your career
I just like playing the game. The gimmicks to get me to spend more money does not make it better.
Lol, Jeez, is it really forth to mention? Can't imagine who this game is aimed at. Halo 5 multiplayer is still in my heart 0w0
Invest
It’s still crazy to me that they kinda just gave up on the AI voices you could’ve had. Like a sgt johnson voice would’ve been sick. When was the last time they gave us a new Ai anyway lol
It'd be great if we got enemies from Halo Wars 2. Imagine fighting a Hunter Captain or Hunter Goliaths! 😲
No new sandbox items?
I just want two helmet attachments so i can recreate my reach helmets😢
❤
Not new game modes? 😢
Sad how they are trying to ride on the success of Halo Wars 2, Spirit of Fire and Red team.. Fix the god damn campaign ffs
🤯
Would have loved to see the story cutscenes they would have made for this 😢
Hoping for the network update to surprise drop :)
omg
Bring the Prophet of Regret back to Halo Wars 2!!! #JusticeForProphet

Alright so when did cosmetics items became more important than the actual game? What's actually new in this CU other than coatings and cosmetics we don't even get to see for ourselves while playing?
All Units (At 343) Please don't abandon this game
Let’s have some fun, Spartan Red Team style
No vehicles?
The music at the end 😭
Amazing song

Would make a lot of sense if the Spirit of Fire came to Zeta Halo.

bruh
no DLC news ;-; No Serena AI ;-; I'm going to bed ;-;
I ABOUT LOST A LUNG FROM GASPING SO HARD WHEN I SAW OMEGA TEAM AND THE STANCHION
I’ll have to play Halo Wars again now
Five years, five long years, that's how long it took us to get Halo back. Now it's ours again
Nice, but can we also get some weapon models for the guns that don't actually have any??
Would've been better if Stanchion Rifle had been its own weapon.  Similar to the Halo4/5 railgun, but it's meant for range and acts more like the railgun from Battlefield 4
right so you use the spirit of fire to make more money on multiplayer? what about campaign?
I can't believe we actually got fireteam Omega, now if we could just get Blue Team and Alpha 9's armors!  Also can we please get Halo Wars3?!
the sounds effects from Halo Wars 2 are so awesome!!!!!!!!!! Well done
Im a firm believer if captain carter didnt dissappear with the spirt of fire they would of single handily won the war
?THE STANCHION THE STANCHION?!@??!?!  LETS GOOO FINALLYL LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Imagine chief going at it alone with atriox again and red team pulls up with the spirit of fire
I've been considering hopping back into infinite recently, not played since before the forge update and combining what I've seen from it as well as this event featuring new mark IV armour and the CE Assault rifle? Yeah, its time to play some halo again
So good yet just 🤏 this close to greatness if only the stancheon was a whole new weapon rather than a skin
Where’s the other shoulder pad for MARK IV? The left and right shoulders are obviously different in the Halo Wars games. The one with the knife isn’t the one I’m talking about, the one in Halo Wars looks different.
looks WICKED
Im crying.
Where new weapons and vehicles?
Ain't gonna lie. Looks amazing but the game is stale now. We need modes and new sandbox items desperately and we aren't going to get them so I have no motivation to play. Just my opinion
YOOO!!! Omega Team looks hella dope!
Can’t help but think since 343  has  announced moving away from seasons. That all the stuff that we want to be fixed, won’t be fixed. And the full potential of halo infinite won’t be realized:(
Any new maps for firefight? Any news on adding assists and a proper score board?
Cool
I don't  trust you.
0 New gameplay features
good content, but,  *WHERE ARE THE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES?*  (the game and the sandbox feels very empty)
I love Halo so much
I wish that jade camo was on armor as well its sick
✌️
no hw3... just cosmetics...
oh! my god... is beautiful 😱😱 👍👍
*NEURAL IMPLANT, RESEARCHED*  _"...War is hell, and I'M the devil!"_
Thank you halo ❤
W holy shit
Havent completed a battlepass since echoes within might have to get back on the grind😂
Only thing I don't like about this trailer is it makes me want Halo Wars 3
Ten thousand years later and the only thing youve done to bring the customization back to the glory days of old...is figuring out how to swap shoulder pads when the bots can do it...  Bravo
I wonder what the story will be with the Spirit of Fire, maybe they could find a way for the Ark to build another Slipspace Drive, Or that they will find a way to get to the Halo that John is on.
Stanchion my beloved
STANCHION STANCHION
this halo wars theme at the end just gives me goosebumps
Oh man, that omega bundle looks so good.
Thats 🔥
see that halo infinite is getting better its getting that feeling like the first time playing halo
did he ask in the beginning * ARE YOU RETARDED? * is he talking about master cheeks fking with aliens?
HOLY W 🙏
I don’t know if I have seen a series drop off harder than Halo with Halo Infinite. RIP to one of the GOATs
OUR BASE IS UNDER ATTACK
My boy Jerome!! Only 19 years old too, due to cryo sleep.
That sniper looked like a railgun!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow that’s cheap af
God what dogshit
STANCHION!! WTF
Very nice!
Wt abt new weapons 😢
Where is the UI update? If any UI changes were coming they certainly would have mentioned it in this trailer .
Woot woot
This game failed in so many ways
Season6? CU29? Idc what you call it as long as it looks like this! 💪🏻😎
YES THE COMBAT EVOLVED AR FINALLY
I hope whatever new title they’re working on explores what Red Team is up to at least a little bit
Don’t get me wrong, I love MK IV, but really?? That’s it?? Where’s the Falcon, saw, double barrel shotgun, VIP, grifball, grav lift, lacerator, stasis field?? All the stuff that’s been 90% complete but they don’t have the effort to finish it?
Halo wars 3 Please?

Should have added different firing sounds to the different models for more bang for the buck. Halo CE classic AR sound would have made the model more amazing.

Yo let me have that marine armor though.
Yeah, lets go, an aesthetic update
Increíble 🎉💯💯💯
ALL MY FELLAS
this is kinda fire
I do like that Halo doesn't use FOMO
OG skin for MA40 is premium!?
Man, hearing that Halo wars 1 soundtrack made me cry. Thank you reviving my childhood 😭😭😭
Of course, only a MP content update. Why did I expect anything more?
Yeeeeeaaaaasss
If the UNSC Spirit of Fire and its crew had been in the Zeta Halo Ring, The Banished would not have stood a chance.
Omega team was just amazing to see. I’m glad they get recognition again
Hearing the Halo Wars 2 chatter during the beginning and listening he Halo Wars theme play at the beginning and end gave me chills. I love those games. I hope we see more Halo Wars soon!
ALL UNITS
Now?
COMBAT EVOLVED AR?????? BROOOOOOO
Damn those armours look cool. Too bad that the damage has been done.  Oh, well. we move.
My god 343 I beg you to give the game more substance than just ways to spend money… any new modes? New ways to play?
Damn that sniper rifle model looks sick
Ive never been more disappointed.
Hasta que te pones a chambear 343
Waste man. Bring us some more campaign content
The Halo wars Sniper looks absolutely amazing
Where's the maps??? I get this is supposed to be small but Forge can literally fix alot of problems
Yoooo!!! a stanchion weapon model?! Lets goooo!!
Well, this was underwhelming update.. 😮‍💨
We atleast got the shoulders ☺
WE'RE TAKING BACK THE ARK WITH THIS ONE BOYS
This about to be a fire operation
Still forced cross play, still garbage 🗑️
Adding new skins does not increase the fun in a game
Kickass.
OMEGA TEAM?!!!!!!!!
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OIM SO EXCITED!
They should have put a few things from the shop into the operation pass but they gotta milk it
Not enough miner- Oh wait wrong series lol.  Seriously though, I'm so hyped for this one. Gonna be the best op yet!
I'm so happy to see Omega Team! My 3rd favorite Spartan II Fireteam!
Illusion 🔥
They should make a last and final chapter Halo game, and then stick with online multi-player ☝️
Notice how they changed the sound effect for the Stanchion model to the Halo 5 Sniper sound
I already know that Omega team bundle is going to be like 30$, but does that thing go hard🔥  I wish they've added more collar pieces like the one on the yellow set
The shoulder piece is weing

Wow free armor but still paying for classic Assault Rifle thank 343

BOOO 343!  TRASH 🗑️ BOOOOOOO!!

And here I’m thinking they’ll tie in the branching storylines 😂 How Halo has fallen…
I thought itd be a small lore addition tying the 2 halo games together, i can still hope
THAT STANCHION MODEL THO... And Red Team running together like that...absolute perfection. Was also not expecting to see Omega either, neat!
...that was it? I mean the armors look dope. I was expecting something gameplay wise like story or something idk
Epic ❤️
I was playing wars 2 because of the update and 97 minutes into a match the game just crashed
No they locked omega team armor behind paywall TwT

Halo Wars 1&2 is/was great, I can't wait.
Isn't this a little ironic on how they also just abandoned Halo Wars 2? Got the flood dlc, nothing for a year, and they hit us with the our resources would be more useful somewhere else.
Honestly, I'd have been happy with just a "classic" AR skin...
cant wait to see gigachad cutter again

We are just one ship, and an old one at that. But here we are... thirty years past what anyone could ask of us. Our war is gone, the lives we had are gone. The worlds we knew have moved on. And now, all that we may have left are those standing beside us... And the duty that defines us battle after battle, fighting side by side. Together. Where you see half a crew, Isabel, I see family, courage. And a thousand heroes who swore to fight their way through hell before they'd ever, EVER turn their backs and run. And where you see one old ship, I see home. And THAT is always worth fighting for.
Is the Spirit of fire making a comeback in a future sequel or something like that?

What I would give for the next game to be Master Chief getting reinforced by the Spirit of Fire to fight Atriox. From the ashes of the Infinity rises a far superior ship.
LET'S F***** GO!
an entire trailer for a battlepass and a new map? wow!
please 343 PLEASE Give us halo wars 3
Is that Proper female spartan I see there?
Shouldn’t have decided to cut off Halo Infinite’s long term support especially right now. You guys piss me the hell off
I'd much prefer the rest of the main campaign...
Though fire, pain, sacrafice the crew of Spirit of Fire and ship herself earned it's status as UNSC Flagship, a symbol of what human resiliance, hope and family can build and protect.

Is this not season 6??
ALL UNITS: l loved the first Halo Wars and I felt I was the online one that did because I didn't have internet when I was younger and the only people that I knew that played Halo Wars were my brothers and one of them said that Halo Wars didn't do well because it wasn't halo due to it being an RTS but I love halo wars and never lost hope in a second one coming out, when halo Wars 2's trailer was showed it was around the time I got access to the internet and I literally cried because I felt like the fans of halo Wars were finally recognized and halo Wars 2 released and It was better in every way.
ALL UNITS
I hope that either Halo Wars 3 happens or Chief meets up with the Spirit of Fire crew in a future game  Jerome would be the only spartan i ever would want to replace Chief as the protagonist, especially since Jerome is one of the few remaining spartan IIs  Looking forward to this and can't wait for the mk IV
"This is Spartan Group Omega. If they want war, we'll give 'em war!"

Y’all gonna un-cancel Halo Wars 3?
HALO IS BACK GIVE HALO 7
Bro what if this shows a cutscene for new halo game but if not that is completely fine.

I hope we get to use halo wars vehicles not just unsc but also banished I hope we can use the cyclops, sparrow hawk and blisterback
im hoping that in a future game we do get to team up with the spirit of fire crew from where they left off of halo war 2 that would be so cool chief with spartan jerome and his friends
You have my attention.

Remove Hidden MMR Matchmaking in Ranked. Remove SBMM from Social. Quit ignoring the absolute vast majority of your playerbase who are literally waiting for you to come out and acknowledge SBMM. Quit avoiding controversy. You're getting worse publicity based on your sheer complete lack of transparency when it comes to your Matchmaking System. The System we ALL know is awful, disrespectful and just plain FAKE. Naded said it himself today: "Halo is WAY more popular than Destiny. The Halo Players just aren't playing the game." This is because of SBMM in Social and hidden MMR in Ranked. I mean if you don't do what I've suggested (and hundreds of thousands of others might I add) you'll continue getting bad publicity, no one will care and you'll continue on this path of complete self-destruction. Devs, it's time you stand up to your publisher and get vocal about SBMM in MCC and Halo Infinite. Do what's right. We're all waiting.
I hope this brings that ALL UNITS energy
I hope the spirit of fire reunites with the main UNSC  Edit: ty for the likes
is that the halo 3 assault rifle?
Does this mean we’ll not only get to dress up as Red Team, but we’ll also go back to Ark? 🤩
343, i know you're moving away from infinite, but before you go. Give us more ways to create in forge. Scarabs, even better AI, more ways to tell stories through the forge campaigns being made. Heck use forge to make operation missions like Spartan Ops!
Leader power ready
ALL UNITS!
This will literally just be new armor pack #38483.. lord knows 343 hasn't done a Spirit of Fire DLC for infinite
Is this update a reference to me?
Let’s go party 🔥
If they want war, we'll give em war
this is an incredible callback image and to see the Spirit of Fire not only in the thumbnail, but *explicitly* mentioned makes me giddy. one of my theories for what Infinite's campaign couldve been involved the Spirit of Fire taking over for Infinity. She's big, but not overpowered by any means. A simple destoyer caused incredible damage to the ship when the two collided. As for how it got to 07 from the Ark i had no guesses. Hoping that's explored here.
ALL UNITS!
Sexo
Wake me when you need me
What is a CU29
Respect to the Spirit of Fire, a half-crewed Phoenix-class Support Vessel from nearly 30 years ago that managed to fight off an enemy more powerful & fearsome than the Covenant and won without any support whatsoever.
🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥
ooooh yeah bout to get the season of fire
VEHICLE DEPOT, COMPLETE.
HALO WARS THEMED EVENT!!! LET'S GO BABY!!! ALL UNITS!!  Will we get any story progression on what's happening with the Spirit of Fire? Maybe some maps set on the Ark during the events of HW2?
Red team standing by
Bunch of useless cosmetic 🙄😑
O O O ODST HEADING- ODSTS AWAY ODST O O ALREADY AT MAXIMUM POPULATION
I'm excited but I'm not getting my hopes up because I know what it's not. 😔💖
"We do not need no freaking spartan!"
CU29…..y’all dumb af
¡¡our base is under attack!!
Art reminds me of the last shot of the OG Halo Wars teaser: "If they want war; we'll give 'em war!"
All I want going forward is Halo Wars units in forge… The Transports and Cobra’s mainly. Maybe the Banished Scarab.
I know in my heart of hearts it's just an Infinite update, but please, I'm begging
Improve complete!
Calling all Spartans…… help Jerome and his team return from battle along with new cross shoulders…. Be ready for new operations soldiers.
YES.
FIRE BASE READY
Thanks xbox team. We forever in your side ❤
If they want war, we’ll give them war
