doing my Mclaren's $10,000 service - https://youtu.be/uj8oj-TvBjg?si=MKU4JM3EwHGH6kjH
A123 batteries are now available for $7, Alibaba!
Lo @10:25, looks like an apartment complex...
6 7 (5)! 😁
I wasn't considering buying the E tron, but you threw in the Jasmin Rice!!! 🤔
I will buy that audi for £1,000. I kid u not. Why? U decide.
first time ive ever seen 2 sponsors in one video outside a podcast
19:30 please use eye protection
“Up and coming YouTuber” lmaoooo not even close at the time this was made.
Car was damaged in hurricane Ian in Collier County.
"Never get outta the boat. Absolutely goddam right. Unless you're going all the way."
Love the safety toe flip flops.
dudes in slides lifting a battery mere minutes after talking shit about ppl in the comments, gotta love the annoying ego, might even come with "dude were just joking around" if we're lucky
the mclaren sitting like a too big of a shit to fit in the toilet...  I like mclaren, but the pricetag is nonsense therefore the business is nonsense, this is marketing, not business.
I think the lack of damage from burning battery is due to that it happened underwater. Be it different there would be nothing to buy.
sy how stupid you can ... make a garage for cars multi lioolions cost ... in a flut area LOOOL   ... you become what you diserve
Everything about these cars are a ripoff. F.E. they use Nissan injectors and if you seek by the part number, you can get them by a normal price but at the dealer - they`ll charge you literally 10 times that price🤫.
Nice job cutting, yeah I didn't have those damn safety glasses in my way!I am a retired journeyman machinist ,if you know ,you know
@Rich - You walk like a duck.
1:12 shitty deal lol
The fuses job is to cope with overcurrent, not to know when the car is swimming. If it didn't exceed the rated current, why would you expect it to blow?
Ill give you 500$ for the car
150k for a replacement battery? I dont care if they are called ''mclaren'', they should go to jail for that. Like strait up, court and jail sentence if they try to charge you 150k for a little replacemnt lithium battery. That should be criminal, i dont care if they call themselves luxury brand or whatever, some things should have limits and there should be JAIL time for bosses, ceo's and menagment involved in creating that bill.
The lack of respiratory protection is concerning. Great video btw
🇬🇧 👍🏽 May 2025  11:30  String cheese doesn't actually squeeze out reliably (in the UK).   It could be that Rich's string cheese has higher oil content than others - making it more slippery.
I interviewed this guy from nissan a few months ago and i asked why the 400Z is so expensive and it took a really long time to get him to admit that the price is bullshit. they can sell them for about half and still make a profit. they just want it in a higher segment because the people who buy them want to feel special for being able to afford something so expensive. That's the reality of a lot of these cars. At the end of the day, most of the components in every car are the same. Sure you have extra cylinders, you have bigger brakes, you have carbon fiber but the reality is they could probably sell mclaren's for like 50K and make a profit. they are targeting rich people as their clients and that's the only reason they are so expensive. to give you an example, years ago beats by dre came out and initially people didn't like them because they were so light weight. they sound amazing but it's all just plastic and a tiny little circuit board. So the company added weights into the headphones just to make them feel heavier, and people liked them more and they sold better. That's why that battery is so expensive. Because price is based on perception.
I thought  mariners  do some  sketchy  work on stuff.
@9:05, you guys are kidding right?
The first clue would be that they want $156,000 for it.
Man told me I had enough eh5 to power houses in my car audio build 😂
Could you not get someone in china to duplicate the battery exactly, circuit boards etc?
I still cant get over you slapping your tires when airing them up and saying "thats about right"  I wouldnt trust you to screw in a light bulb 🤣
Rich, you are not seeing the Value Added by the UK's Taxes. Just touching the king's soil demands 25%!
Make the joke about lifting with your back, and then he straight up lifts with his back 💀
Why did it set on fire
You can get them cheaper than 25 dollars
Aliexpress has them A123 for 13$ lol but this was years ago I wonder what price was them prob even less
YALL need invite Jeremy Fielding he prob get kick out it And bring a different perspectives
Crazy guys you guys are awesome
This was a battery masterclass .. take notes kid, this is serious stuff :)
All sports cars are a ripoff they are made from cheap parts from other cheaper cars and the price is hiked up x 3 so yes most are just expensive tat with a badge on the front but people buy them because of the badge and that’s why the price rises just because it over a million doesn’t means it’s worth that
What is the white, horn-shaped air blaster that is being used?
Fascinating.
So, 18:00 in, the task is spelled out. You are building a new car and dropping the Mclaren body over it.
Sounds a good deal for a british quality engineered battery.   Just remember to top it up with tea many times a day
tavarash in the McLaren approved flip flops for service.
@12:38 can you post an affiliate link for these safety squints?
How would you do all that cutting and hacking on a battery that has power?
At 12:33, no safety glasses on the dude using the grinder.
Buying that flood damaged p1 is a bad decision.  It's a money pit for millionaires .
A stump grinder might get more of the ingredients into the environment.  Try to pollute like men
I was stunned to hear that battery caught fire and that compartment contained it, amazing!  Even if the battery was near total discharge, it would have still gotten pretty hot.  Cool tech!
McLaren is a rip-off. Much better cars for less.
Can I have the Mahkit Basket rice and you keep the Etron?
I think he actually believes we’re supposed to “lift with your back, not your legs”
testing for shit mate, it's been submersed in water, they will be fully discharged aka dead.
Whilst carrying a really really heavy battery, I’m glad to see that you’re wearing a sturdy footwear. The kind that has a steel toecap and will not just fall off your foot.😮
Imagine buying a totaled McLaren for half a million dollars
Yall didn't check alibaba for the batteries!?!
Just bought a McLaren...   hat.
I see the F1 with the plate F1 joy almost daily alongside a couple others including long tail gtrs P1 gtrs etc at lanzante
Just sayin sandals might not be the footwear for carrying a McLaren battery.
As opposed to the whole car?
Don’t post videos of doing donuts in a car you’re trying to sell.   Tends to put people off buying it.
McLarens are fascinating, they develop a chassis, then gradually changing the bolt ons for 20-25 years selling the same basic car for decades 👌🏻😀  To be somewhat fair its understandable (so as the pricetag) when we are talking about such limited productions, but still 😀
Rich is really funny.
'Takes a licking'...
With slippers on. That is smart.😂😂😂
Piece of advice, if you are trying to sell a car, don’t show video of you doing donuts with it in a parking lot.
That P1 though.
I thort flot car was illegal to buy or is it only if its salt water they are floddet with ? American laws are wired som times
Chris Slix might need some help with his McLaren.
It's not a ripoff. The simpletons who would buy such a thing will gladly spend ten times that ammount for a battery just to talk about it in some video. McLaren understands perfectly the market and its clients mental accuity/prowess, this is why it should be named "ripfool" instead of "ripoff".
150k for a P1 battery! total rip-off no battery is worth that much NONE what so ever! Mclaren parts in general is so overpriced it makes me mad! and they are not even reliable cars in general!
Bro your taste in cars is ASS
The ad segways are freaking on point 😂
These companies sell to rich ass holes. You know the spoiled young brats with extremely rich mom & dads. Otherwise this vehicle is guaranteed divorce bait, once the wife finds out how much it costs to replace batteries, she was with him for his money anyways. For the rest of us, when we go to auto zone and buy a $ 150 battery for the Honda Accord the wife complains it costs too much.
Would never buy one if had all the money, it gave me one I’d sell it. Saw a documentary on these and they don’t start when it rains half the time or more.😂😂😐
guys please PPE
I'll do work for you you'll see
Love the complete lack of safety glasses, respirators or gloves! Then there's the flip flops and shorts!!....LMFAO! 🤣
I Fuckin hate when someone is doing work in sandals slides flip flops w.e even shoes sometimes is nuts
To say that it is a rip off is a bit harsh. You don't pay for just the individual parts, but also for the design, development, testing and production costs. A car is much more than just the individual parts.
$7.20 Alibaba 15:00
So all of that and we did not learn anything? maybe that its impossible?  I know someone could work with he CanBus and get it sorted, but would be hundreds of hours I bet.
1.5 million subs, u could buy a few McLaren’s
i dont think anyone wants that ricer etron
i only see people showing off vets and scats lol - love mclaren
570k for a flooded P1, I’m so poor
When your Audi breaks they will install a VW part with huge mark up on it 😁😁
Batteries are so extremely expensive so no one’s want them as a second car. Its not worth the stupid fabricated prices.
Thats crazy even for airplane prices
So you’re saying I should just put a 550ci nitrous big block in my McLaren instead? Alrighty then yes chef.
BRUH PLEASE STOP WEARING FLIP FLOPS… SOOOO UNSAFE
12:37 No safety goggles? No problem! Just perfect that safety squint while slicing through a water-corroded volatile LiPo battery housing with an air-powered cutting wheel.
5:46 My favorite footwear for hauling heavy, hazardous EV car batteries? Beach flip-flops, naturally! They provide stellar grip, ventilation, and cushioning, minimizing the risk of dropping that beastly load on your foot over uneven terrain—especially while moonwalking backward like a champ.
Heres the thing if the item in question cost 10x the price of the materials/labor to make that item in all reality its a rip off so all lamborghinis all ferraris all gibson guitars paul reed smith guitars all of everything that cost more then the price to produce including paying people to make the item its a rip off and yes that means every single house in the us market is a massive ripoff sorry guys we live in a world where your getting ripped off by everyone for everything nothing cost reasonable amounts anymore people make up numbers and force you to pay if you want it bad enough you will pay for it period and the companies know that.
damnit Rich I didn't even bat an eye at the E-Tron until you threw the Jasmin rice in the deal
Cool beans dude. I thoroughly enjoyed this video. 👍
For that money you can put ultracapacitors or supercapacitors like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_TS040_Hybrid. And they last forever.
first indication it's a ripoff... it's $156,000
24:46 The fuses can’t be blamed. The battery was not overloaded but flooded. These fuses are not temperature sensitive.
You guys are going to have exotic luxury lung cancer.
Why are you carrying something that weighs 150 lb in flip-flops It's beside me That's like an amateur going rock climbing without rope. Yes you could do it but you are very stupid. You may work on cars and flip flops but even I don't carry everything's without proper feet protection You tripping fall in that battery will crush your manhood
1yr later and still watch this video like the 1st time. Great job Rich.
The car still costs 500k flooded? This world is cooked? 😅
your bus fuse didnt blow because the battery was not overvolted. what probably happened was the lithium in the battery came into contact with water creating a chemical reaction fire.
5:50 "remember to lift with your back and not your legs" proceeds to lift with back and not legs...
Never trust a mechanic that wears flip flops while doing electrical work or moving heavy objects (because that's a guy who just doesn't care).  This is a good video though.
McLaren f1 isn't the same  as any of the others. It was designed by Gordon Murray who builds cars better than any one else.
6:11 walking backwards in a pair of slides and carrying something heavy is real talent! 😂
What the hell is Freddy wearing on his feet are those slippers are you a homosexual no man wears shit like that how gay looking
im literally the only one who thinks mclarens are ugly
Should be thankful that thimg didn't go nuclear and just discharged...could have been WAY worse LOL
Everything McLaren is involved with is an enormous ripoff.  You act like this is some sort of revelation.
I didn't think you would ever cell out.
Glad to see he had his safety slides on while lifting that toe-breaking battery.
Looks like a grand Prix
I would take a McLaren if Givin to me but I do not see how everyone else does with then I don't think they are attractive or that special maybe it's just me I just feel like they are over hyped. I might be in the minority but that's ok
Love how he calls Freddy an up and coming YouTuber 😂
This is very entertaining🤣 W😲W did YOU GET THAT IN YOUR FACE!!! NO😵‍💫  God lord man just to save some money these dayz🫨
Using a cutoff tool with no eyewear is not smart.
I bought a 2007 Toyota Yaris Hatchback instead of a Mclaren, saved a bundle
Rich you have 1 million followers on Youbuube and you can’t afford a McLaren?
As far as I can tell they are the same as the hedways I have in my 2 vehicles for the audio system, hedwSybis just a brand name, the hedways just have red plastic around em. my van has a 32 cell 64AH  and my car has a 12 cell 24 AH. Last time I see new headways they were maybe $14 maybe less used hedways are like $8 each at battery hookup.
Sounds like a dentist office
Disassemble AWAY from the building, wear gloves and face mask.  Have fire retardant available.
Overpriced shit.
6:00 this is where my toes all tucked inside my asshole!
Thats incredible knowledge
Unless you’ve tried to lift a battery of that size I don’t think anyone could truly appreciate how heavy it is. I had a 10 kWh battery delivered & my back still twinges every day just to remind me 😂
Watching you blow on that battery fire wow man that's nuts.. 2 seconds off and your whole face was melted off, gd that was crazy to watch Glad you're OK
an example of shit design.  Even if the fuses were good, they could have made it where the fuse was accessiblle for removal
Hope you're not breathing in that battery dust. Yikes
The sarcasm is suspenseful. Wow 9:40 look it’s perfectly fine. Temu probably has parts for that I bet!
😂 ......BRO! You don't post video of doing donuts in a car you're trying to sell. That's crazy
Always thought the hybrid system was cool in the McLaren but now I see it's just a big money sink that you can't even throw money at. Deleting the hybrid system would save on tires and be more agile. 400 lb is a lot in a car like that.
Tarv seems a kind of falling off the radar I don't know if spending all that money really was worth it he could have built a million other cars and made tons of other YouTube videos and saved his money then rather than do that nightmare especially how detailed he is trying to make that restoration
The fuse can't do anything when the whole thing is underwater. It's not the fuse's job to protect the circuit in that scenario either.
Wear respirator taking batteries apart 🥲
I want a t shirt with a McLaren on a toilet 🎉
I need five likes for my ears exploding when video started🎉
12:33  SAFETY FIRST!!!!!!!  ❤ Wear safety glasses, friends; those spinning cut off discs break easily and like to travel towards eyeballs. Great video btw ❤
I imagine "what if" I somehow got a job at Electrified Garage, and Rich starts talking about the way all the pieces of the battery and car work together - and I just nod my head and let him talk, knowing that if I ask any question at all he's going to wonder wtf I'm doing in his garage.
This is helpful those cells are $4.16 from china but was considering buying a flooded EQS 2023 that on face value looks spotless but this whole battery science has really demotivated me
I guess Rich doesn't mind breathing cobalt, maganese, lithium, and nickel dust 🤧 during Lion battery🔋 tear down.     Maybe it's only dangerous if you breathe 🫁 it every day?  John sure got a face full 😮 .
11:38 Pause
Wow  That battery is a damn joke  Build a LIFEPO4 battery for about $500  Those are not an 18650 my dude  LOFL.
if your hiring .. i have hammer experience
the more carnage the better the show....
Reason 436 why I hate hate hate EV's and hybrids. Companies like Jaguar are sealing their doom by pledging that they will only make EV's, when they've made one of the most sublime and rewarding cars of all time,,, The F-Type.  And of course, those people worth respecting know that EV's don't do a damn thing for the Climate,,, mostly because in reality, there is no abnormal climate change,,,, but that's another story.
I am disturbed he lifted the battery with sandals on
Yo bro, you have to pay to play 😂.
Forget buying the car just for the car I'll buy the car just to get the jasmine rice.!!!😂😇 👌✌💛🗽💯
eBay batteries are mostly counterfeit. You need to buy them from a reputable source.
"This is not me " 😂😂😂
BRAVE TO MAKE A VIDEO TO SAY THAT.. THESE PEOPLE HAVE WEIGHT BEHIND THEIR NAME, THEY CAN COME AFTER YOU FOR POSTING THAT.
If the battery burned did it damage the structural metal properties? Usually the temperature could destroy the temper or hardness of the structural metal.
Battery fire + carbon tub = likely tons of micro fractures, compromised structure, disaster
7:53 ~ Yeah, get a little air on it.  Should be good.
Any chump can buy the actual batteries and bolt them in a box.  You can't buy the electronics, which is where the expense comes from.  The argument you're making is comparable to you want to buy a car for the cost of the raw materials vs retail pricing.
McLaren is a trash car

Bro you live in Massachusetts and at a YouTuber with 1.45 million subs, you and I both know your and your neighbors house combined is WELL over $600k.
Who cares if you look cool while driving the speed limit in a car that wasn’t designed for it? Just make cars functional cheap and reliable again. When I have to hire someone that makes more than me to fix my main mode of transportation, we are living our lives wrong.
My other McLaren is a Honda Element
Why in the heck wouldnt you move your car to a safe place before the storm hit? Smells like insurance scam to me. Someone couldn't keep up with payments.
They are built by blind experts
you are buying a modern day supercar... and complaining about being ripped off... sorry but were you thrown at a brick wall head first as an infant?
Liking Tvarisch’s steel toed sandals
5:51 poor vs good form
should be renamed to why mclaren is a ripoff. their cars are far from worth the price
The Brits sure do know how to design beautiful super and hyper cars.  They also own many accolades in the automotive world.  My favourite specialist engine designers in the world are British, who have designed many of the world’s most amazing engines.  Cosworth are probably the best engine designers that have designed tested and built many of the ground breaking engines in motor sport.  They even designed engines for Ford for the Ford Sierra Cosworth and the Escort Cosworth rally cars that dominated the sport.  They cut their teeth designing engines for Ford in formula 1 as well and also Indy car.  Just recently they designed the ground breaking 1139 HP naturally aspirated and beautiful sounding V12 Aston Martin Valkyrie engine and for Gordon Murray for the T.50 & T.33  V12 naturally aspirated engine and it also sounds so sweet and furious.  Cosworth are the best sports car engine designers in the world.
guys should wear some masks or something working with batteries like this. had a friend that tore up a wooden truck bed that had old batteries that leaked into the wood. messed up his lungs real bad and died on the transplant list a couple years later
lol the guy said lift with your back and not your legs and apparently he meant it
is rich using ai for his own voiceovers ?? lol into audio is booty poppin p's peaking all over X(
Do not buy a e-tron Audi is a nightmare to deal with and the  dual clutch tranny is just a bad idea for a hybrid. Audi doesn't want to give you their warrentee and they will make you go way out of their way for something that is their fault. Switching from hybrid to regular gas is bad. aka when you run out of electric charge your clutch is going to have issues and just in general is not designed correctly. I have driven one and one of my family member has one. Their great gas cars, but stay out of E-tron. Not worth it just get a Q3-Q-4
Dude, the only reason you have  anything left to work with is because the car was submerged in water when the batteries caught fire. The thermal runaway would otherwise have destroyed the car and the guy's house.
You just casually pulled up my neighborhood on Zillow and I almost fell out of my chair..
500k for a fucking reck? Holysheet that is insane.
5:52 no dude, you lift with your legs and not your back!!
If I could afford that Audi I would be all over it! Heck, I don't think I can afford to buy any car right now........
CAN bus connections were the bane of my existence in FRC. We had WAY too many motor controllers
11:40 squee- squeeze my- squeeze my mea-
Wait, I live in Ocala, this is nuts
Zero PPE used 🙈
Worth noting that those A123 cells are LiFePO4 not traditional 18650s - which are a fair bit less dangerous in failure (it’s a lot harder to get a LiFePO4 to fail catastrophically)  LiFePO4s are a bit less energy dense like you said though; but you can definitely get cheaper ones than $25 per cell
These batteries cost 10$ in China
Time and time again it seems like batteries are the issue in one way or the other
FWIW, A123 LiFe cells really aren't like LiIon or LiPos.  Yes they're heavy and  if you short them out externally you can start a fire in your wires, components, and frame shorted through the salt water etc, but the cells  themselves do not burn, and they can be often be recovered from a 100% discharge with no measurable degradation in performance (which is why the military is/was interested in them).    They're good for thousands of charge/discharge cycles.     We used to use em years ago in RC ground vehicles and aircraft and they could be safely discharged faster and deeper than the Lipos of the era, and more importantly charged *much* faster than any Lipo or LiIon (which for the most part is still true today).   A123s  are rated for a safe 5C charge rate.   This makes them ideal for a lower capacity but very powerful hybrid system where you pull the battery down when you're accelerating and dump as much power as you want back into them with regen braking and a serious generator.  They don't even get that hot, or care when they do get hot.   So yes, you can get the same Wh *capacity* with like one much smaller/lighter brick of Tesla's 18650's, but it's highly unlikely you can match the max cycles, and charge/discharge rates.  That's why Tesla uses a gazillion cells, both in series and parallel to reduce the charge/discharge rate for any single cell.    A123 cells also used to be used in some power tool battery packs for all the reasons above, but they run as a lower nominal voltage (with a damn near flat discharge curve), but then the after cells became very hard to source (were taken off the consumer market to be used in other applications), and they found that higher voltage lipo and now liion packs could deliver more power at same or bit less weight.  Still generally charge much slower though.
Makes a joke about lifting with your back, then lifts using his back while wearing flip flops.
I mean, come on dude.  It's a joke to say it's a rip off.  The entire car is a rip off.  Just you have enough rich dummies that have more money than brains.
After watching the whole video i can personally conclude that 156k for that battery is and not is a ripoff at the same time hahahaha
this ninja did NOT just flash his address
Remember lift with your back not with your legs lol NOT!!
I’ll keep that in mind next time i buy a mclaren gfy
They all look the same it's like a  Porsche 911
"the fuses didnt do their job" why would a fuse do anything when theres 75 thousand gallons of catalyst surrounding the battery ._. power aint flowing thru those fuses my boy.
Not that I would know what to do in the situation, but I love the instinct to blow on the battery as it is about to explode
There is no point in complaining about value for money. They are expensive to stop poor people owning them. The ultra rich want separation. They want to price you off their turf.
Please brother wear a mask when doing this. I know I am not an expert but there is no way that it wouldn't atleast be recommended.
I've never built a battery, but in this case I'd be wearing a respirator during teardown. That thing has to be loaded with toxic shit.
All my friends: “lift with the legs not the back”  Rich and I with our devious humor: in a violent, jerking twisting motion
why would it cost that much that's crazy
Non car related question. Where can I buy those black adidas you rocking?
Contact the company directly.  Maybe there is a competitior
I found your problem.  At 7:36 there is a bit of corrosion revealed after removal of the cover.
Did you hear that ladies? That battery is massive.
I'll trade you a 86 fiero gt for that audi haha 😂
I got distracted and then refocused my attention on the video at the 6:00 mark and was like "Are they about to toss that thing in the bin?!". lol
Tavarish you need to lift using your leg not your back. Otherwise you will screw your back.
I disagree with the whole rip-off claim. not that I defend McLaren for their pricing strategies, but please remember that this vehicle came out in 2013. so it was in development up to 10 years before this date. which means the cost of the battery is related to the time frame it was designed and engineered in. also, the time frame when they were ordered. all this explains why this battery is so expensive. still has a HUGE McLaren tax bill added to it... just not as big as the one you are seeing now...
50k for a gt audi is insance they are a great value as is and this is even better, one of the most fun cars to drive IMO in the EV segment rn
the carbon tub is probably NOT fine. the fibers are fairly resistant (but still flammable) but the epoxy that holds them together is probably shot.
Just put a fuel cell instead of the battery and have an extended range.
15:10 doing it for years but not wearing safety glasses!
What is McLarren? 😂
It landed on a toilet because you have to be a heavy duty narcissist to pay that much money for a pos to make you feel good about yourself.
I really want to do work like this how can I sign up in dead in the water 😅
That little apartment complex projects costs 165,000 small ville 😂😂
my brother  in christ please leave peabody. we need your talents elsewhere
Literally EVERYTHING about high end cars are a scam. You are paying for the name and the illusion of quality. Go get a Kia and stop contributing to the dumpster fire that is the American capitalst economy.
Why would you show a eBay price.
no combined there between 850 for the lower two and just over a mill from the ones at the top so a little more than 600k? 😅 do you need a tutor
I thought the yellow P1 was from Harvey in Houston?
10:15 don't inhale that stuff, unless you want to be cured of your bipolar!
5:54 lol I don’t know why I let that guy doing heavy lifting in flip flops trigger me like it did🤔
Just because the fuses did not blow, does not mean they did not do their job, it means the fire was not caused by a short of the output.
It's a mclaren it's all a rip off
Damn he got that ai voice on lock
ironically says "lift with your back not your legs" as he lifts with his back and not his legs
I'd rather be my normal humble self with an average income, than be a manipulative narcissist who gets money thrown at them due to scum advertisers, because they make cop out Youtube videos that focus around intellectual property that they played no role in creating.  I'll never understand why humans prop up and support those who don't need or deserve it, and neglect those that do.
are those fumes safe to inhale
idc about the rice bruh how'd you make a car with no interior
Will double a batteries work
easy buy a car that doesnt require a huge battery, since you are infact driving a bomb around
Best Shipstation segway.... possibly ever.
12:36 ah yes the ol' squint eye protection
The lack of PSE is disturbing.
It's planned obsolescence. All the manufacters do the same and other industries like appliances where the control panel is designed to fail and the part costs as much as a new one. Its why to right to repair is so important so you can buy a 3rd party battery/parts and install it yourself or hire a independent mechanic.
"expensive brand has expensive parts" No poopy Sherlock. 🙂 Yeah but seriously, *all* expensive cars are overpriced and all of their parts are overpriced. In some cases they take regular carparts, slap a sticker on it and mark it up by 250%.  And there is nothing wrong with that because the people who buy these cars have so much money they simply don't know what to do with it.  also: "every youtuber these days has one"  I noticed, and I wish they'd stop copying eachother and do something original.
Dude should just throw a twin turbo LS in there and save couple 100 grand lol
love how you call him an "up and coming" you tuber, he has heaps more subscribers than you.
Alibaba says 10$ per battery cell which would be 3600$ total.
this is my first time watching this guys vids and the way he puts sponsors in his videos is actually genius
Man the skills level of these mechanics are ridiculous 😮
alibaba offers that stuff for 10€ each if you buy 200-500 pieces
Now this is my fear of the unknown,  but I think I would be wearing a mask around that thing lol
Thumbs down for the clickbait thumbnail
12:27 someone give that man some safety specks! Lol seriously, I've had to see an ophthalmologist twice over the years to have debris removed from my eye. Now I always keep a good pair of 3M glasses on hand for any cutting/grinding
Dude that thing looked like a coral reef when you cracked it open 😂😂 love what you do man kudos!
Safety sandals, squint safety goggles, lifting heavy ass battery packs with nothing but your back.
I love how Tavarish sarcastically says lift with your back, not with your legs, and immediately after lifts with nothing but his back. Freddy, you will pay for that when you get old, trust me.
Wait I thought these guys were ditching the hybrid drive, what happened
Not a fan of hybrids, you pair the complexity of an engine with the weight of batteries. Either go full combustion engine for its good weight to mileage ratio but with the downsides of having lots of parts that break and need maintenance. Or go full EV for a simple powertrain but with the downsides of having heavy batteries an thus low range for its weight. Hybrid is complex, has lots of parts, needs a ton of maintenance and is even heavier than full EV - the worst combination possible.
Bro use some proper PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment) write that shit off on your channel. Shesh
I could've told you it was a ripoff just from the price
Arguably Youtube is a really good thing for McLaren sales
dude works on electric vehicles and has a corded sawzall. nice
I use a 18650 battery for my e cigarette device.  Who would of thought me and McLaren using the same tech
Salt water damage?
Hey cameraman fuses only blow when they recieve more electric current than they're rated for so it's not surprising they were still okay
Ripoff like Huusk Knives.
as Freddy LITERALLY lifts using his back lol
bro just doxxed himself
i am aware that insurance companies are incredibly afraid of ev's liability. what will they do if they discover a battery has been repaired? will they raise the rate or cancel coverage?
Everyone's got one now
Fuses don't prevent the battery from internally shorting and blowing up...
there junk . a big waste  of time . what so specail about them besides a huge  price tags .
Fuses arent there to protect the battery from flood water or fire, they're to protect the cars wiring and other components from fault current.
I thought Tesla battery packs were expensive lol.
7:07 xD "im not gonna touch it"
Obviously everything they produce is a rip off and always has been. Their target customers are extremely wealthy people.
So much hustle — why did you not simply put it in rice?
The salt water saved the fuses.
what the hell is that airgun thingy????
Mc Crap. EV fantasies using spent energizer bunny batteries.
If we could stop making BS like this, we'd have affordable EVs.
I came to this video just because I wanted to say I don't need a video to know a $156,000 battery is a ripoff lol.
If Mclarens were priced "affordably", they won't even exist. Supercar manufacturers aren't cash cows like the Toyotas and VWs of the world, and they are not meant to be affordable. They are toys for the rich, and more of a status symbol than an actual sports car to be driven to its limit.
In the interest of safety, no one wore a red shirt.
There's a LOT in the supercar industry that's a ripoff,  not just the McLaren's battery pack.   Like all those Lambo parts that say FORD on them, and Porsche and Bugatti parts that say AUDI on them, for starters.
5:56 wow look how fat dude has got. I seriously can't wait till I find the youtuber who money didn't go straight to their damn heads
SHOW US THE MAGICIAN THAT MAKES RHE CAN BUS WORK.
Not a ripoff, but overpriced.
If it’s leaking oil, it still has oil
Hey Rich, did you sell the Audi-etron? If not let me know.
12:33 Bro look it could explose!
156k it was only ever one thing
So Taverish aka Freddy is up and coming with 2.75M subs? Ok 10-4
(Re) Building batteries tomorrow  is what rebuilding a transmission used to be. Just make it all electric.
I know Yall PRO mechanics or engineers and all that shit. I just cant help myself. Whatever you do man if you do it in flipflops i cant take you serious. If you would come to build my house for free in flipflops i would tell you fk off mate.
The first sentence was a doozy.  A sound explanation for why even rich people stuff is banal and boring these days.  Everybody has one.  Not really, but its no longer so exclusive either.
Love the safety flip flops
I love content like this. I do the same thing in everything in my life. I have repaired so many things over the years that saved me tens of thousands of dollars by researching and jumping in.
*_Really glad I'm not a guy with huge moobs wearing a t shirt too tight for a chick. Just saying._*
Fools and their money !
In flip flops...
7:51 - What's that blower attachment y'all keep using?
It's totally legal to scam rich folks so McLaren is safe.
those batteries were very hot lol
Just pit a tesla motor in it and make it faster for 5k 😂
Thanks Rich! Million dollar cars are junk. What in the world can I get out of a Million dollar car, settling around in my garage or driveway?
I wouud keep the electric motor and ditch the gas engine
Cant afford car anyway .
I just wanna drive one to work T_T why do all the good cars have to cost a ridiculous amount.
Come to Canada, you can get a toilet bowl of a house for $500k
It would be advantageous for your organization to consider expanding into the educational sector, particularly focusing on youth engagement. This strategic move could effectively facilitate the next phase of growth. Areas such as technology and electrical battery development present significant opportunities for educational initiatives for underserved youth and can help in fostering innovation and skill development in younger generations. Love the channel!
Brother, you are INCREDIBLE! An unbelievable wealth of knowledge!
Many thanks. Now I won't buy a McLaren.
Why isn't someone coming to Rich to start a company building simple, inexpensive, easy to work on electric vehicles?
ZERO EMISSION 😆😆😆😆  😉 OK MY CLIMATE WARRIOR SHEEP.
Rich build a battery for tavarish man I believe in you bro you the best
Yuck
LOVE THIS CHANNEL NO POLITIC NO RACISM NO MUSIC PERFECT
These car are definitely good for the environment.  LOL
I asked an EV car maker, "How long will this car last"?  "How many miles will this car supply me"?  How much money will this car save me, in the long run"?  The answer - No Comment.
5:50 Proceeds to lift with back
Dawg, your video is crackling
3:10 lmao
I like how he jokes about the battery being safe to touch at 0 volts. Then he implies it could still have a way to zap ⚡ him. Reality is, it *probably* won't hurt you with electricity but it's hard to be certain *plus* there's a significant risk of chemical burns if you touch any of the powdery stuff covering the battery.
I don't need to own a Mclaren to say lifting heavy things in flip flops is a dumb move.
Kettle hot water the best to clean solt off.
damn tavarish is fat. O.o
I dont know his name, but there is problably more than one guy.. but this guy took a 78 camaro, slapped detroit speed and a ls3 in it, ran laps on mclarens 🤣  And could probably builds 10 of these cars for the price of a mclaren, and it had 5 seats 🤣🤣  Imo a mclaren is a owerpriced piece of shit for people who wanna be someone or dont know shit about cars 🤮 Rich is one of the few exception, we all know rich dont buy a mclaren to be something he already is, and he know how to fucking build a car 🤩
Their interiors are bland and boring.
The ever witty and very clever Rich ,doing what he does best.
“Lift with your back, not with your legs.”  He does exactly that.
Did u really just post ur address thats crazy
I always have good laughs when I see you videos!!
Sounds about right, make for nothing make tons. All the pharmaceutical companies and others live by this. cost 25 cents to make charge people who really need it 400 dollars for a epi pen. But wait you need 1 for home, school, and any other activity that your child way be in. The world is truly fahqued
5:52 - fully executed the lift with your back. 10/10
buy a rav 4 battery
Why buy this shit buy a classic car a real car.
12:30 Squinting eye protection: Enabled
Thanks for the excellent run down on the tear down.  Sounds like McLaren built a "look at my hybrid" for people feeling guilty about spending 2 million on a car.
Do you have an option to use a different battery in the various McLarens, or do they effectively paywall it by making it proprietary and necessary to use their product(battery)? I'm a big McLaren and Aston Martin fan, but McLaren moreover for the F1 team because life as it is right now I can only afford a Mercedes.
Well, he listened! Great explanation.
N64
The flip flops ? 500000$ car 15$ flip flops and a chance of losing your toes ? I’m sorry who’s the genius? Pass on your junk
McLaren made a big mistake by not helping him out with a new battery, mainly because once owners of same cars see the benefits without one, they will be less likely to replace there old one when it needs replacing, hurting them in the long run, obviously they don’t have anything $100.000 into those batteries.  But you watch, there inability to help a damaged car, is going to hurt them in the long run, they seem to think existing owners don’t want to be a part of something this damaged..  who ever is making decisions at McLaren for PR and Advertising.. totally dropped the ball.. sometimes you have to eat $h/t to enjoy good outcomes
doing my Mclaren's $10,000 service - https://youtu.be/uj8oj-TvBjg?si=MKU4JM3EwHGH6kjH
I wonder who is going to get cancer or some other disease from not wearing proper protection taking apart those batteries.  That crap is toxic.
It's an absolute shame freddy is ruining the P1 when he is removing te battery power.... it's not original anymore and the value will crash even more because of this stupid decision
I would have to say it wasn't so much the carbon fiber tub and/or how well McLaren did in it's manufacture that contained the battery fire in this case but rather it was the fact it was either underwater or close to being underwater at the time it cooked off. Carbon fiber it's self will not burn but the the resin its impregnated with will once hot enough and once that happens its all over. I do wonder what other parts and pieces of their cars are they completely ripping you off on?
This was fun, but it would've been much more informative had you provided a little background on what exactly the McClaren battery does and why it needs to be so big (compared to the 12v battery in my Subaru) and so small (compared to the lithium battery in my Chevy Bolt).
Why do McLaren's need such large batteries? I asked Google and ChatGPT and got nothing so Obi Wan you are my only hope.
you should also get a Lamborghini for us old-school douchebags!
Something tells me thats his house address and his ex got the house. Funny how court works haha GOT EMMM
Man said $3 like it’s an 18650 😂
You’re saying people shouldn’t send it to the dealer but you’re also doing very sketchy battery work
that's internet for you everyone is an expert on everything yet 99% of ppl online can't even think for themselves let alone having any amount of knowledge on any subject
you ppl are Crazy $575 000 for a bunch of junk but hey i wouldn't pay even $75 000 when it's new
Mclaren shmaren 😂
"Lift with your legs not your back" *Both lift with back*
See this video it makes sense why Freddy scrapped the Hybrid idea. He’s trying to say a fire risk but it’s really the cost and development time n
I saw the thumbnail. How can they justify $156k for the battery?
I suggest using a good partical dust mask. I've did a lot of work inspecting vehicle fires and their is a lot of toxic chemicals that may show up later health wise. I know a few fire investigators that have developed issues and have died from what the did. Part of disabling a EV fire is to dunk it in water. That's what the flood did.
So it literally it isn't a CAN bus bus a CAN'T bus?
the answer to the question is simple, because all the car has the same proportional ripoff in each part. they can write 2M, or4M or 10M doesnt matter if there has people ready to spend it.
Here are two things that always are together:  Overpriced car, small penis.
720S?  Yes.
Yea I’m going to drop 50k on this car he’s beating the crap out of.   Thinking he’s not a member of the critical thinkers society.
I just paid $215 for a battery and felt like I was getting ripped off.
That Carbon tub is good marketing point "At least your whole car wont burn"😂
Well, it's not a ripoff if you can afford it. It's not about the item, it's the brand. When you buy a McLaren, you don't just buy a car. You buy. A McLaren.  If you think paying that much is ripoff, scam and totally unacceptable. You obviously doesn't belong there, maybe stick with Honda or any 'cheap' brand.
👌
Don't need to do any can bus sniffing, can reverse the software on the ECU and BMS and reprogram the ECU to talk to any can bus BMS you wanted. Reading the ECU isn't hard, i don't imagine reading the BMS would be difficult either
I would say they chose those specific batteries because of the available charge and dischange rate compared to smaller batteries, and i wonder how their energy per kg is as apposed to energy per cm^3. If a battery was lighter but much bigger and gave better charge and discharge i think they would go with that option
the fraction Rich struggled with is about 1/25th ("few hundred"/8000)
Imho it is far better to convert it to a 100% EV using a Tesla drive unit and batteries and maybe a new third party can bus system.
You can find tonnes of McLarens in scrap yards in Dubai.
P1 without a hybrid is just a kit car
I can see Rich fully respects back injuries and has probably had a few issues. Freddie still thinks back issues are a myth🤣
So this is a hybrid? I mean I couldn't believe McLaren would ever build a straight EV.
In the case of this car. Wouldn’t it be better to just delete the hybrid system? I would make the car lighter which should of set the mileage of the gas engine. Considering I have no idea how much the hybrid system takes over for the gas.
Why are people gonna buy a car that is gonna be effed out it's mind ..1000 miles to test is very little time ...and then the vids of him ripping it around a carpark ..ye thats gonna sell it ..what damage was caused during that vid ...any warranty come with it ..prob need two tyres for starters ..I'll pass this time ...don't trust dealer diagnosis
This is where I hate modern cars, you can't just fix things. You may have to figure out HOW it is sending that data, pray to god it is not encrypted, then of course you may not be able to buy the parts any more, and it is not something you can make, unlike pistons/bumpers etc...
This car is a total scam. Imagine how many garage queens batteries got drained just for them to buy a new one for 150k. Insane.
Yuck.
Solid work on the patented safety squint while operating the die grinder.
Honestly put a Toyota 3.5l v6 Hybrid engine, battery and electric motor into it and you would have a great car.
For the love of all that is holy, please wear eye protection when doing this kind of work.  You have only one pair of eyes :)
He is definitely not up-and-coming he has been around
156.000 batery...now that's robbing you ....more than apple and Samsung together
Tavarish: lift with your back not your legs. Also Tavarish, proceeds to lift with his back 😂
here's me buying an actual mclaren - https://youtu.be/pb33b4_lsxc?si=0GRe_wK_ILBx1DHi
Yes I agree with you and Freddy scrapping that hybrid system and just building a crazy motor for that P1 great video 👍
I don't know why this car has a battery with 6 miles of range. I assume it makes the car faster when launching?
Weird that mclaren doesn't have the parts on hand. AFAIK fed law states parts must be manufactured for 14 years after that model year was produced. Unless they intend to spin up the old machines and find the molds/components each time one is needed
Interesting, you are making a suggestion that the owner of the car may not want to hear and would cost you money? Sounds like something I’ve done before in my business, it’s called common sense 🤷🏾
If i was shelling out that kinda money andbhad that money, honestly id make this a one of one and  just do a full e-car conversion for this McLaren.  It would probably be more reliable.  Thanks for the educational bit at the end.  It was actually super informative and made dum dums like me understand why hybrids are such a b**** to work on.  Its either all EV or ICE in the future when retromodding.
Yeeh, those dude rebuild, and another dude having fun, then burn their car without regret 😂
Hybrid systems are overly complex for the benefits they provide. I honestly don't see any purpose of sticking with the hybrid system for this vehicle.
Batteries are like PC's. Why would you build an old legacy PC? Upgrade to LFP or a tesla bank. Ditch it all and call it an upgrade (just like Mclaren did).
$56,000 would be a rip off let alone $156,000
Fascinating stuff! 👍
Among all the projects worked by YouTubers, this one is the most risky and I hope they do not end loosing a lot of money.
"up and coming youtuber" who has almost twice as many subs are you. Put some respect on Tavarish's name.
💪👊👏
Yo that lexus hood is fuct
Actually, other than the McLaren F1, the best "McLaren" is the GMA T.50  I'm willing to fight over this.
Batmobiles
12:30 Engage safety squints!
Car to house price ratio is frightening.
there is a guy around where i live that has the 720s it looks so beautiful but i bet its a pain to keep running
my mom buys that rice. its da bomb!
That might make sense, but if he's "building a P1" people expect the hybrid system to be present.
soo... $100k plus for 1 mile of drive...  guess i keep my old toyota...
Well that's a lithium iron phosphate so the fire risk and energy density is kinda different
Batteries were submerged in salt water. That's why it didn't burn the car and the house down.
i agree! scrap the outdated hybrid motor.  it was a marketing thing anyway, it had no effect on vehicle but making it slower do to the weight.
Rich’es 🤣good vibes sent bro!
At first I thought you put Newbury St in Boston as your address and thought “You live in the dumpsters? No way your house is only a portion of 500k. You could buy two perfectly fine P1s for the price of one house…I mean brownstone…on Newbury”  Then I saw “Pee-biddy”
Oh yeah lets lift a 200+lbs battery while wearing sandals... I wonder what could go wrong!! :P
Could you not get the truck closer to the battery? 😂
0:25 ASC McLaren Grand Prix being left out makes me unhappy. xD
They had to let it out of the garage . He wanted the paycheck lol
no Senna? interesting.
Are those steel capped sandals?
Like the way these lazy fuckers slip in their adverts so you don’t see them coming! Packet of rice with every Etron! $12k battery for $150k! It’s an F1 company what do you think! Same people who cost the F22 Raptor toilet flush buttons at $220k
Its a great video, it would be ever greater if you could hold the camera steady. I mean i wanted to watch more but i got a headache.
why dont you men bring out a work table and save all that back breaking bending over, let gravity work for you, and how about saftey glasses with all that grinding you are doing?
who wants to breath that lithium dust?
they want the same markup - that is all.
$33,499 2019 for sale, etron.
in so many work... buy a new one from Mclaren instead of trying to 'fix one'
MAKE A TESLA BATTERY WITH DURACELLS
WOW I CAN BUY 3 ETRONS FOR THE PRICE OF A BURNT BATTERY  NEVER  MIND I ALREADY  HAVE A DAYTONA COBRA 1/24 SIZE SO ALL IS GOOD
I dont need a video to let me know this.
I cringed at the 50k etron because I can’t afford even the cheapest one
They dont mess around building those packs. That thing was held together like a tank.
Sorry but i thinkpaying over 30 grand for a new car is fucking stupid. Hell twenty grand is too much. But then again I've had my car for 24 years and I can count on 2 hands the number of oil changes i have had done.
Two words, safety glasses!
Just send it bro
Mclaren is ALL about ripping their customers. And their cars are butt-ugly.
Headway 38120HP LiFePo4 Super High Power Battery Cells.    These are similar in size, high power, and almost double the capacity...  They are cheaper per cell with plenty of places selling them used for ~ $8 a piece.
Are we just doing monthly videos now?
6:15 bro your kicks tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🥹 I’ve been looking all over the net for them
rich r u ok? its been 3 weeks, we miss you.
151 Newbury?  Haha. I'm one of few that caught that joke. Go Pats!
Buy that man some eye protection, please...
????  Still alive mate?
Love watching your shows.
Hybrids are a waste of money. Higher cost and poor performance. People buying them, instead of a pure EVs, is like contemplating jumping out of the closet. You like gay culture, but is not prepared to take the plunge.
Nice work man, and great advice for freddys build. Invaluable input and advise,  more so than even Mclaren could even manage themselves. Respect, subbed and thanks for sharing..
"better than the look they gave you when you told them you paid $70k on a Model 3 Performance 3 years ago"...Hooooo!!! Haaaaa!!! I can't...I can't....Hoooooo...
Please post a new video
I think you should collaborate with @Tinkergineering for a build.
They could have done a better job by submerge these batteries in oil and the fuse will protect the batteries if there is a short externally.  But than weight would be a problem.  Than again less battery = less weight too.
18:17 i'm pretty sure they updated p1 battery a while ago. That being said battery prices are going down and they are still overcharging for it. BTW im pretty sure that mclaren itself does not make it. That probably makes it way more expensive than needed.
I know nothing about McLarens or eltric cars but do you think the entire battery is trashed or do you think some parts can be salvaged?
Dang Rich you dont fawk with us no mo...where the videos? If you're in jail let us know, we'll bail you out.
3 Weeks no video's? I gonna call SamCrac to make a visit because this is crazy.
What is going on with your channel?  Have you stopped posting?
Front drive using a tesla motor if he wants hybrid imo
Dropping the battery in a bag of rice is not going to help, AT ALL. great video 2x👍
Tavarish and his work approved slides
Buy a Koenigsegg ... a quality brand. McLaren is trash these days.
The greatest mechanic that ever lived
I've been sent by *THE GREATEST TECHNICIAN THAT'S EVER LIVED*
Love how they do this work with no safety equipment. no gloves, no eye protection, no nothing. lol
"I'll see you guys next week", yeah, alright
where is ICE T
Where is the video at for this week?
Was feeling a little down today so I decided to watch just the opening monologues of your videos. I feel much happier now
First time here you got recommended by THE GREATEST TECHNICIAN THAT'S EVER LIVED...😅
Your a losser that owes people money
Stop talking and act like a know it all
You ever pay that guy back the money you owe him???
These are 10 bucks a piece from China
Been two weeks Rich, Chop chop with a new video!
Up and coming? His first video is 17 years old or something LOL tho he started regularly 8 years ago I have been watching him for like 4 or 5 but have gone back through his videos. But up and coming? I like your trolling
BRUH DAT SHT IS GONNA CATCH FIRE. GUARANTEED
How is Steve. Channel was so much better with him. Hope he is Ok. Maybe get his own channel.
So whats all that concrete looking stuff on there?
Where is the new video for this weekend?
Any m5 videos?
My first thought is. HOW in the world can someone drive around a new 2 million dollar car yet so many  cant even afford 1. Next thought thank God we have young folks like RICH that can figure this all out. I'm in my late 60s and all I know are motor head engines
Johns ppe - look slightly down and to the right while cutting into high voltage batteries. We don’t need no stinkin gogguls
lets hook that battery up to a rc car
Rich, what’s are your thoughts about the M5?  Your viewers are waiting
Screw the  Audi....I want the Rice!
I really hope you are going to be well in a few years after exposing yourself to all the toxic waste from the burned out batteries. The guys just moving the burnt out cars of the burned out cargo ship that lit up for days off The Netherlands were in full hazmat gear, they weren't pulling battery packs apart
Damn...just realized we are neighbors
Carrying that heavy battery with flip flops on. 😅
All I could think of is Rich dropping his end.....Seeing those toes freaked my out
Rich, a fun idea for an EV conversion would be the old Honda insight from early 2000s. They are super light weight and aerodynamic.   Cheers
can someone tell me what the compressed air blower attachment is?  Cool Video! thank you!
17:13 - "Tavarish really wants this car to be as original as possible" - Given the amount of "improvements" he's talking about (eg. engine, aero etc.), that seems to be a less than accurate statement... Unless of course you by "Original" are referring to a unique creation!
missing Stevon
I’d love to see Freddy get ahold of a Lucid or plaid motor and stick it into the P1 if he goes hybrid.
Up and comer lolol
I always find it funny how afraid everyone is of these batteries. Not throwing shade, its just crazy that we have things that are that dangerous in cars.
Conclusion: The juice ain't worth the squeeze.....
12:35 was waiting.. for the giant KABOOM cut scene
Florida explains a lot.
I wouldn't be worried about the effects of the batteries explosive residue.   In the air and in their lungs ,cancer risk?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude needs a 150k nose job
The P1 took a fat shit
That battery pack is fubar
I love that you used the GB’s address 😂 @richrebuilds
Selling you yesterday’s tech today, at tomorrow’s price!!!
"the car was trying to sell us something" lol
HAHAHA! I love that he's not only using a die grinder on the battery pack with all that corrosion and everything, but no safety glasses either! Lol! 😂  Good thing these things are already trashed. 😂
better do a zinc-acid-air battery yourself, it works very much like lead-acid battery, up to 1300Wh/kg depending what materials are used to build the container box. specific energy mostly about how much water needs to be added to znso4 in the discharged state. use carbon rod/felt as the air positive electrode. yes its zinc electroplating cell in znso4, making zinc and h2so4, and oxygen, and some hydrogen, depending on voltage. zn metal plating target negative electrode should be also carbon, rod/felt, will not be affected by h2so4 or znso4 in electrolyte water. expect specific energy to be about 1/3 of the full 1.3kWh/kg (that would be 433Wh/kg), because one parts of znso4, two parts of water, to get a full saturated solution of znso4 in water.
Why the smartest and most hated man at Tesla speaks once again!! GO RICH!!! Now let's see what you can do for Mclaren!!! LoL   Great Video. Really interesting conclusion..and really cool concept.
That lift look like 1/2 disk  hernia
Lol, i deliver bin there dump that dumpsters, when I seen one in the video I was like “what” must be a bigger corporation than I thought
remind the world to turn notifications on mine keep getting off from youtube
The whole car is a rip off bad body lines unreliable over priced maintenance cost ridiculous
Rich. Stop promoting huusk knives. Its not made in Japan
I don't drive Audi very often but does that e-tron have a dent on both doors in the same area?  It looks like a 3 inch gap between the door and the next panel.
I laughed out loud when they said "remember, lift with ur back, not with ur legs.  Yeah, with a twisty, jerky motion"
Was that a slight disc “an up-and-coming YouTuber”
@24:30     GREAT ADVICE!!!   My hat's off to you, sir!
If you PAID ME, I still would not drive an EV.
Richbuilds. Are you a Toyota guy? How about I invite you to my technical school in kenya 🇰🇪  to talk to the young auto builders?
7:48 ~ Yeah, okay guys...time to throw some dirt on it and go home.
I would love to have that e-tron!
Someone buy me that e-tron plz
Mclaren forums probably have 10 times more people than cars that have ever sold lol. I wouldn’t know because I’ve never visited a mclaren forum
I think it could of still be possible to rebuild the battery if you guys did not destroy it the way you did. I’ve rebuilt total flood electronics. Sometimes it’s impossible some times it’s possible, depending on the design of pcb. Also, the pitting on the aluminum is not from electrolyses, electrolyses removes material from positive not from ground. The pitting you see is from droplets of salt water that left more salt on the surface than there were on the other surfaces where there was no droplets, and the moisture in the air kept activating the salt, aluminum hates alkalinity. I wish you guys would of spared the battery.
I think your conclusion is what he wants to hear.
Great video!  Amazing explanation of the hyperdrive system
Every thing to do with  Mclaren is a rip off.
Translate the étron fron google French to English, and that tells you everything...
Why haven't i seen anyone say they buy that car.  That's a steal
What is that air blower called ?
100% drop the hybrid as it is old tech and just save weight and boost engine power
This was fascinating to watch.
Have you sold your e-Tron yet?
Ev is just a stepping stone for vehicles. Really just a test to see how far we can push lithium 🔋 battery. When cars fly or hovering these lithium battery will be involved
"Up and Coming YouTuber, Tavarish"  about a guy who has over 1 million more subscribers than you.   Lol
You should take a look at Amprius battery cells recently reviewed by Sandy Munroe. They carry 500kw/ kg. The would give you a lighter and more powerful battery wit ha silicone anode.
If this clip doesn't tell you how much of an environmental hazard batteries are, nothing will!
This guy paid half a million dollars for this fucked up shit of a car
why rich look like he getting buffed up .....
stop confusing power and energy. the P1 hybrid system cannot be measured by range. its lightweight and powerful, adding those are low energy density/high power density cells, 14.6Wh 550W per cell. you can charge/discharge them with 1% /sec by 10 sec burst so 10% in 10 sec. you cant replace that with tesla cells or any  battery that's not specifically designed for high power, even if its more modern tech...Its batteries meant to be light but powerful for performance hybrids.  compared to tesla model S plaid battery cells they hold 3.5x less energy per kg but 6.7x more power per kg. this is why the car doesn't have much electric range, the battery is designed for power and weight, not range. speedtail tech is not worse its way better, its same power for half the weight. electric range is not important metric for an hybrid super/hyper car, weight is much more important
Nice -  these colabs are great ..
Nice work  Out of my league tho haha😢
06:00 WTF did you just do with ur back, u suicidal? I am not sain "Go to the gym fat bitch" but at least learn some fundamental movements right that you need to work and survive dayli so that you dont hurt urself in the long run adn that you dont have no pain
It was hurricane Ian that hit Sanibel Island outside of Ft Myers.
8:50 - the fuses were successfully protected by the rest of the battery pack self-immolating 😂
You live at the Golden Banana?!  I knew we were almost neighbors, but I never knew you were DB himself!  thank you for your service to the community. haha
I never thought I would see  Rich and Freddie working together after Freddie & his friends ran Rich out of that car show. Rich is the man helping out Freddie & Hoovie and not holding a grudge
Where my main man SteVon at?? Wud be nice with an update
think you should have parked the truck closer
Glad to see Travis Scott in the car scene again!
Audi E-Ugly
He looks like an idiot wearing sandals and working.  Unreal.
Said only in the way only Rich could say it. I love it!
What's that blow gun?
5:50 "Lift with your back, not with your legs" which is wrong, it's the other way around, and then proceeds to lift with his back lol.
Cut that awful 400 pound dinosaur  out of that car for good
5:55 that was the most florida thing ive seen in a while Its Tavarish lifting over 100 pounds in sandals
Interesting stuff.
5:51 😂
The ol' safety squint never lets ya down, until it does lol
The common sense route is always the best.  Simplify, simplify, simplify.
What is the difference between these and the headway sells? the amp hours and voltage says it’s the same.The headway sales are a lot cheaper. could these maybe be used as a substitute?
"The fuses didn't do their job" Er. they didn't have a job to do!
100% with ya on ditching the hybrid system. invest that time and money into the IC engine, and have a much lighter car to boot.
A123 are good cells
Watched the episode with you and Freddie .. was fun watching you get into more detail
You pay for the prestige not the practical price. Capitalism at it's best.
Can anyone explain me, what are they afraid of in DC battery? Even hundrets of volts wouldn't even "zap" you ...... and it you won't hold your hand too long it won't even burn you ..... all this in very highly unlikely scenario you would touch both poles together ..... and since it is not grounded (literally to ground as normal AC network which is grounded every few meters in urban areas), touching one pole (no matter if it is AC, DC, how many voltage) will do you literally nothing ...... so I'm wondering why are everyone so afraid of this batteries? I believe only risk is the chemistry, so leaked chemicals and chemical reaction if insulation between li-ion polymers is broken so it can violently react like fire or even explosion if it is in some non-expandable closed container ..... non of the above apply for this battery .... so my question is why? Why are you afraid of DC battery?
🍌🍌🍌🍌LMAO… great address
SUPER CARS SHOULDNT HAVE BATTERYS HHHGG
Hybrid supercars make as much sense as a condom with a hole in it 👍  Why not save the weight of the battery and motor and save the greenhouse gases emitted during the electric components production?
Lol, great job testing continuity of fuses while all still attached to the bus bars 😜
Are you rebuild g wagon ?
Hey Rich! Can you do us a favor and *squeeze* just one more commercial into your video? Thanks!
Just a guess, but it could actually be the submersion in water that is the reason the burn of the batteries, left so little damage compared to when other cars have their pack breached.  As it is submerged every cluster of cell that have enough voltage to overcome the resistance of the water could discharge individually instead of having all the power short in a single place, this could have dischanges each cluster slow enough (with the cooling of the water) that you did not get a classic catastrophic cascading effect.
I agree stripping the hybrid system out is the best option. You either go full pow pow or full zappy zap.
Stupid folks ( all of us) paying for name brand items.
"Up and coming youtuber Tavarish" lol. Only two and a half million subscribers. I hope the young lad finds a little success :P
Must be LiFePo4 technology.
i'd have to be a complete idiot to pay that kind of money for a car. No thanks, i'll stick to toyota.
why does the audio in your video almost always pop with any cut?
Picking up a battery with flops on SMDH
SAFETY GLASSES!
what is that air attachment he keeps using to blow it off?
Hahahahaaha, what an incentive 😂😂😂 I'll take the etron for free with shipment to the Netherlands. I'll pay for the rice 😅
A rich fool and his money is easily parted. 😊
Are those LTO cells, or normal NMC? If they are LTO it might explain why nothing went up in flames. LTO (and LFP) are very safe chrmistries.
I've been thinking about the recommendation to trash the hybrid system, and this is my opinion, fwiw:  If you are rebuilding one of the holy trinity of new unobtanium hypercars, and you don't rebuild the hybrid system that was a large part of what made this car an instant classic unobtanium hypercar...then you didn't rebuild a P1.
lipo batteries be doin that
Wow dope video i like how u amd Taariah did this collab fr fr
You wasted no time lol kus seen u on tavarish
"This is not me" on the ad. Oh man 😂 cracked me up
Wish I had 50k I love audi had 2, 95 and a 96 audi a4s and I loved them always been into vw and audis and the etron is such a freaking beautiful sexy car to me I'd buy that in a heart beat if I could ! Someone is gonna get one hell of a car.
*You can buy a Tesla Model S plaid with track pack and have lots of money left over for the cost of that battery, 0-100km/h in 2 seconds, drag time 9.3 secs quarter mile.* 😂😂
*$150k for a battery two people can pick up, ya gotta be joking.* 😂😂😂
*$150,000 battery, lol, buy a Tesla Model S plaid for $100,000 it's faster and have $50,000 for a Tesla Model-3 performance 0-100km/h 3 seconds for the wife, no maintenance for 4yrs.* 😂
*Beautiful until you see the running and repair bills, Tavarish is spending several hundred thousand dollars to repair his car.* 😂🎉😂🎉😂
Ha ha up and coming utuber, he has twice ur subs?
It’s for a multi million car, bought by a customer on an emotional basis. It’s not meant to be a good deal, it is a luxury product.
Yes design helped, but the main reason that car is not a pile of ashes? It was in a swimming pool. Literally under water when it happened. Maybe not the whole vehicle, but probably the whole battery. Fire fighters WISH they had a big tub of water to chuck these things into when they catch fire, because they have no other viable option. Put it in, wait a couple days.
This video was wicked , thanks for sharing.
7:40 You guys need to contact one of those "Good Restore" channels from India or China.  They'll get that thing fixed right up and even give it a fresh coat of krylon
When your video has more ads than youtube xD
Dont remove it. That’s what makes a P1 a P1…
Love the link from the rice to the shipping company sponsor, a very tedious link 😂
What to buy Freddy for Christmas: Steel toe slides.  (That's what we call open toe sandals in South Florida. Flip flops go between your toes.)
So the whole hybrid aspect was basicly a 150,000$ novalty component that costs millions to r&d .  If you run out of gas you can get 1 mile down the road.  Wow,😢. 2 mil. Well spent. 💰⚡🔋   Leave that paper weight out and fly.
"lift with your back not your legs and a twisting jerking motion" This got a chuckle. :)
Holy shit i havent seen your videos pop up in my feed ever.
I discovered you through tavarish. Not a car guy but now i have something interesting to talk to car guys about
fuses rarely blow ;_)
For all actual McLaren owners, Dan and Brian at Exotic Specialty Services in Huntington Beach CA are the guys to use. They were the McLaren and Ferrari Service managers respectively at Newport Beach McLaren and Ferrari and these guys are way cheaper than the dealer and much better service. They love and know these cars inside and out. People ship them their cars from all over the states.
the safety squints at 12:30 ish 🤣
Everybody thinks wow McLaren hybride but its really nothing and its carbage. But can you sell the car for millions without hybride?
you are a smart man
Hey Rich. I may be able to help out with the Canbus…  I focus more on VW stuff, but have some info for this system. At least a dbc somewhere.  I also have some vids of hacking a VW charger.
Through the right distributor, im certain you can get a bulk order discount on unit price on those cells. Oh, so you're giving away rice? Is that because its too late to fix the drowned mclaren with it? 😅
Hey uncle Rich, there are 2 things that do not tally with the number of cells found in the battery with respect to the voltage 536V printed on the yellow label on it.  From your counting this is a 168s2p battery which should give a nominal voltage of 537.6V (3.2V x 168 = 537.6V) as well as the amperage which should be 9.0Ah but 8.8Ah is printed on the label.  Unless these cells chemistry is different from what is printed on them A123 AHR32113 Ultra-B 4500 mAh Nanophosphate LiION!
Ripoff? No, tax on the Rich & Stupid. The "Yellow Submarine" was not worth 5% of new price.  Expecting a salt water immersion of the battery the only thing that could have saved it would be an a thin oil filled cavity. The , not "good", fuses  are protecting the battery from EXTERNAL errors, not internal. Replicating the Hybrid Control system will not be easy, and buying a new one?  I'm sure McLaren will share all their design info and schematics.
cells by A123 for Mclaren (before Tesla's 4680).
I agree with you I came from Tavarish video and u make complete sense to just take out the battery now with that said will he need a stand alone ecu due to the car ecu still thinking it has the battery system and regen and cooling?
didn't Freddie cheat on his wife with his friend's fiancee
You sound like an AI voice
The whole mclaren itself is a ripoff
Such a Large battery for a "Mechanical" car.. 😢
What?! You mean to tell me a sportscar that only like 0.001% of the people can afford overcharges for things in it for repairs etc.? How can such outrageousness be allowed to exist let alone continue?
I thought the guys in the UK already had a solution for this? Why not use that OR pick their brain to get these specifications needed.
22:15 HOLY SHIT that guy could have lost his face trying to blow that fire out 😢
Not using eye-protection with a cut-off wheel.  Yikes!
They could make it for you in China for maybe 20k
FFS lifting a heavy battery wearing a pair of FLIPFLOPS!!!
I am predicting that in 15 years from now, no one will even know what an "e-tron" is, but everyone will know what a Taycan is, because Porsche will still be making it, and it will still look like a Taycan, too. That's because Porsche know what people want, and make it, and then keep making it better over time.
Hilarious to see that dude try to blow out the battery fire like a birthday candle! 😂
Battery made the truck drop a whole inche 😭
As a fellow Massachusetts native. That market basket jasmine rice hits different
Bro didn't even mention the Senna
On a cost benefit analysis the hybrid system makes no sense at all.
I’d like to buy your strong, how do we proceed?
Adapt a stand alone conversion kit into the car.  Probably cheaper and easier.
Well then just crank up the boost and see if that engine can safely make 1000hp without blowing itself up
What kind of air gun is that?
There is a guy at a university that can tell you a lot about anything hybrid. Weber university in Utah has a channel on YouTube Weber auto. This professor has an amazing knowledge of all types of hybrids and electric vehicles.
The Fuses did not blow because the fire was on the supply side rather the load side. If you decide to forgo the battery etc what effect will that have on the COG of the car and handling?
Love how they lift the battery in  Osha approved Sandals 😅
I want to use EV plug like a J1772 to charge my 36V golf cart. Does anyone make such a device or would this be a 1 off custom like what you do? Long story of why I want to do this but it is needed.
Those cells are used in Volvo buses. There are quite a lot of used modules available typically with 80% health. Not sure if you've got those buses over there?
That's weird there's 4 cells right on top of the unit
Oooh a backwards printed packet of jasmine rice where do you get that lol. Seems someone forgot to flip content during the editing, at least its not just me that does stuff like that.
Up and coming?
Freddy carrying the battery while wearing slides... definitely OSHA approved.
DB's Golden Banana....? 🤣
Here is a McLaren opinion: Crocs sandals are in fact, not a working shoes
Might I recommend high voltage protection gloves should be worn with a cloth liner and have leather over them. One prick and it doesn't do any good. I work in wireline telecom and we wear them for protection from power
not worth it...   nowadays I see these cars as absolutely useless...  what can you do with them...  well, everything you can do with normal cars, except, carry a bag of groceries in it ( no room )  or carry an 8x4 foot slab of wood.... .... but     you can go fast while sucking gas like no tomorow AND get lots of speeding tickets while your at it..  Useless anywhere but a race track where you can unleash it.......oh..... thats why I bought a shifter cart,accelerates faster then any car, and even gets some air on a track here....think itas max speed is around 160 mph bbut your ass in 2" from the ground, makes it feel like twice as fast...   oh they adrenaline rush........  for not even a 1/8 they price!      awesome
What brand of safety squints y'all using? I don't think mine are battery acid rates
It isn't just the battery; the entire car IS a ripoff!  I would NEVER own a McLaren, even if they gave one for FREE!
yeah but do you really have a p1 if you delete the hybrid system? might as well strap a turbo to a honda and call it a day.
I LOVE TAVARISH'S HAIR
Looks like a nissan leaf battery
@6:08 They're walking just like munchkins!
What about the right to repair, shouldn't this be the whole point?
All I gotta say is... Toyota Hilux... You won't have this problem with a Toyota Hilux... 2JZ, scissor doors, big turbo, beadlocks with slicks, it'll never cost you 2 million bucks, it'll never die on you because of a little hurricane flood boo hoo... 😂😂😂
rich read my mind! early on in the p1 project i just thought put a decent gas engine in it and call it a day
Hacking the CAN!
meanwhile the people at the insurance company laughing their asses off to see their write off sell for 500+k and some youtubers dismantling the pile of junk
Free rice with the car?! Why not just put it in the glove box when we buy it?! Hahah
Ok cool so a rich guy needs us to watch his videos your also in so he can make more money cool got it, lol.l
All this for a 6 mile battery range. Sheesh.
No disrespect boys but who in their right mind would pay that much money for a project like that? Nuts!
The 'This is not Me' disclaimer got me lmao
Ignorant click-bait title.
Would 21700 or 26650 be better than 18650 ones?
I agree with everything you said. However, seeing you holding a pen with your not left hand is creepy.
"Which he bought for 575..." *me thinking that's a great deal* "...thousand dollars." WHAT
Great respect to Freddie but I'd strongly recommend different footwear when working on cars. I truly hope he doesn't regret it one of these days...
kaboom
put in a small block
Where can I get 144-month financing? I have an AMC Pacer I've converted to solar and battery using batteries from Walmart and a solar panel from Harbor Freight. I let it charge all day and drive it at night. Last night I got 14 miles per charge, then towed it back to the house. I'd like to trade it in on a McLaren, but will need to finance $15 to 20K on a good one -- nothing from a flood though.
@ 05:51 - Did I really hear "lift with your back and not with your legs"???? Ouch! Bad advice! Lol! Supposed to be the other way around.
At 10:50 I think a bit of Tourette's kicked in.
I actually understood a good portion of the battery tutorial, thanks Rich for schooling us again!
First time watching Rich rebuilds……..love it!!!……am getting ready to look at and  watch back videos…..
Yeah just out of curiousity I pulled one of the 18650's out of my vape.  I calculated it at about 46kJ of energy capacity (3500mAh at 3.7V).  Those giant mclaren batteries are around 52kJ (4500 mAh at 3.2V).  That is honestly suprising.  They are almost the same capacity. I bought mine at a vape shop (didnt shop around at all just bought what they had), I'm sure I was overcharged but online they are anywhere from 8 to 12 dollars. So they are about half the price for probably twice the energy density
Can't believe you didn't start to golow in the dark after touching that battery
lol he said lift with your back and he really did xD
When the P1 came out, I unrealistically wished that someone would buy one, and rip out all of that hybrid BS. Fast forward 10 years later, Tavarish, please do a Hybrid delete 🙏.
can we get stevon back?
I agree with the delete. I think it was kinda a gimmick at the time. They kinda put it in to increase the price and also as a point in the advertisement saying look we have hybrid drive. It was never intended to be an actual part of the system.
I think you will find that a toilet is acualllly a ceramic jack stand.
Not a plastic tool in sight
I still can’t believe bruh seriously tried to blow a lithium fire out.
Up and coming YouTuber? Lol
it's over 10 year old tech, the amount of R&D he'd have to actually pay to do would be SO unworth it.. Good call Rich. Good call.
Im a bit dubious over how he tested those 4 fuses.
Up and coming youtuber 😂
Reasonable decision. How do you spoof canbus messages? Asking for a friend...
Oh shit.... Market Basket.. Damn, I need an eTron.
Execs shouted an arbitrary 6 figure number and called it a day.
Let's move a potentially live (I know it's not, but DO THEY?) 600v battery in slides and sneakers with no socks. Ok. Well, we're wearing gloves, come on man.. Right. OK sure
I see them using linemen gloves without leather covers or inspection dates. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Gotta be more careful guys.
Best advice Tavarish ever got on the P1 was to ditch the hybrid system.  Save 400lb, and only lose 6 miles of electric range?  That is a no-brainer.
Tavarish already got and offer for new and better battery made by that British dudes he visited who were upgrading McLaren's.
Broski called Tavarish an “up and coming” YouTuber with double the subs as you 😂
You're a very smart man!  Great video!  I say scrap the hybrid system on Freddie's build!
Hey Guys I’m so excited to see you Guys create miracles, from any situation
change title to why all super cars are a complete rip off
i think he should keep the hybrid system. cause if he were to do the delete then there wouldnt be much point in rebuilding the P1. if wanted to make the ultimate mclaren without a hybrid he could have built a wrecked 720s which is a lot less special IMO.
i have never been this happy to not have to work on hybrids
Mate, i love the way you work with this batteries and tools. Looks like old days mechanics, bare hands and force 😂
Hoovie should buy this E-Tron.
This is the Rich Rebuild that I signed up for. Good stuff, and thanks for sharing 👍.
When Rich seems like the furthest thing from a sell out...  and all he really wants here is a cell out. lol   A123 for the WIN!!!
Tavarish is an up and coming YouTuber? Hahah
144 month finance lmao
I like the safety sandals while picking up that huge battery. Are they steel toed? lol
Yep. I agree. Get a programmer and remove all the PIDs and logic associated with the hybrid system and call it a day. A good programmer would cost you a few thousand dollars at best.
Realizing YouTubers have better equipment than most mechanics. Why do you have a ultra sonic cleaner😂
This video needs 5 upvotes per viewer.
Why does the white guy have to do all the dirty work?
LOL.... people waste so much money on stupid stuff, no wonder Amerika is falling!
Hope you can reverse engineer the protocol and simulate it somehow
Aaaahhhh slippers! The perfect attire for lifting a 100kg battery.😂
The most viewed video in a long while 🎉
'Up and coming youtuber Tavarish' 🤣
Legendary collab! Tavarish is a beast
its not a P1 without hybrid,
"My house and neighbour's house combined arent 600 grand". This makes me cry as 6 million NOK or 600k USD is a common price for a small apartment around Oslo.
Is the rice still available??
I never liked this car,
excellent video.  I commented on Freddy's first video of the p1 to get rid of that battery and that electrical stuff.  I definitely didn't have all the info from the research from the research you did then but I just wanted it to be a gas engine car only.
Tarvarish wearing flipflops while carrying something that could crush his foot :)
5:50 "Lift with your back, not with your legs" - Yes, great advice if you want to end up in a wheelchair.
Apparently there are companies that build aftermarket ODB diagnostics for Mclaren P1s. They might have a bit more information on the CAN communication of the battery. Adding that part to an suitable OpenSource BMS might get you some way.
great job tavarish 😊
Got to agree with you Rich. Ditch the whole hybrid system. A 400 pound weight saving is a HUGH performance upgrade, it's also the KISS principle at its best. Keep it simple stupid 😊
12:34 i see my friend here has his safety squints engaged
Ditch the hybrid... good choice to save this car in anyway.
Appreciate the common sense thoughts on ditching the "politically correct" useless weight, and making the car clean and fast.
Safety glasses?
Hope Freddie listen to your advice and delete the hybrid system!!
a bit disappointing that 75% of the video was taken from Tavarish' video
@tavarish, you need to stop junk food man.. we saw the struggle getting up 😅
Rich, please, never stop what you do. The car companies are hoping to have us by the balls in the future by only selling us their OEM batteries. As long as people like you keep doing what you are doing, they cannot keep ripping us off without any other option for the customer.
This is not me 😂
To be honest, the whole car is a rip off!
Why not just spend the $150k and then flip the car after you're done? It's a $2 million car, right? It wouldn't be a P1 without a hybrid system. Then again, Freddie can make it faster and better than it ever was before, so ditch the hybrid system and build the car for you, not for some billionaire who has no clue what is going on under the bonnet anyway.
Just looking at that battery pack I would of scrapped it in 10 seconds just the electronics was beyond repair,  Just use the shell and stick a normal ICE engine in it,
Unlike LaFerrari, P1 and 918 are heavily turbocharged, with turbochargers that are too big for their engines alone and optimized for the top end power. This is why LaFerrari isn't plug-in... it can work perfectly fine even without electric part and uses hybrid system just to recover braking energy and give an extra boost where possible. Both P1 and 918 are plug-in hybrids as they always need charge in their batteries for normal function. They depend on hybrid system to pull the car through lower RPM range until turbos spool-up. Which is why hybrid system can't be removed from the car..... I mean, car would work but it would be awful and unbalanced to drive with engine left as is, and even worse with Freddy's plan to go for more top-speed and top-end power. For more usable power curve, smaller turbos would be needed, but then you loose top-end and realistically.... for that he could have just bought 12C.
Dude is a battery guru,no doubt
400 pounds!!? That's a no-brainer, delete that weight!
Not batteries, cells! - Cells make up a battery :)
Blowing on the battery fire, lucky there. Good call, much better without hybrid system.
Greetings from Germany, you don’t get a house as cheap as 600k over here
Wow , thanks 4 the show. Truly bizarre stuff for me.
Wouldnt the bus just look for voltage and current reading from the cells so couldnt you get batteries made out of the same composition with similar specs and call it good? or is the issue that you guys dont have the modules that will send that data to the vehicle?
Is it better to skip the battery and rebuild the engine only? The new engine might get from doner car some where. Less complicated and easier to maintain in the long run.
Hold up Rich are you telling me Freddie got the battery info from Jay Leno?
You could say that about anything percentage wise, when you are a low volume car maker making luxury hyper cars, getting your money back from development alone, paying highly skilled engineers, designers etc and then selling enough cars to make enough profit to be able to do it all again for the next model you aint gonna say "put 10% on the cost of that", you would go bust in weeks . I worked in retail and was also a buyer, there were plenty of products we bought for penny's and sold for 20x more than we paid. I also worked in a garage for 15 years after that and every car part is highly over inflated in price, when Honda and Rover were in partnership the same shared parts were twice as dear for the ones in a Honda box. We recognised a lot of parts and cross referenced them when repairing Honda and got the Rover part to save customers money.   So although your tile says "a complete ripoff" can  technically be described as correct, there is a lot more to it than that ....
765LT is my favorite modern McLaren.
Sooo I got done watching Fresdies video and now watching the other side from Rich’s video is awesome.  But yea I wonder if McClaren is getting pissed with you guys exposing how they are draining the rich of their money because basically they are building the cars for what 50k and selling them for 2 mil lol.
Any battery the size of a europallet is overpriced when costing more than 10k. 156k is like tiny little Chinese children harvesting the Lithium by hand for the British children assembling the batteries in 30 minutes a day work shifts with a day of holiday after each shift, forgetting what they have done two days ago and redoing 50% of that all over again. This is just hilarious to ask for this much money for a damn battery pack.
I could list to Rich and Gale Banks all day
Sponsored by DB's Golden Banana 🍌🍌🍌
I have followed this guy who is restoring the water damaged McLaren and I agree with you saves both money, weight and a lot of headache. And since he decided to do a "custom" because the carbon fiber shells where too expensive he might as well go for a bigger engine and stick save weight, money and headaches... 👍
The wheels on the etron look like Pontiac Grand Prix wheels from the early 2000's.
i was gonna guess 25 each i swear lol 5$? thats practically what a single D battery costs now
Freddie could and should take Rich's advice and ditch the hybrid system....for now. Put the motor and the chargers and controller on a shelf and possibly at a later date when it becomes more feasible to have a better hybrid system install it then.
*Amazon Germany sells the batteries for under $16 free shipping*  😂
ebay...you living on la-la-laaa land...there is 99% FAKE.  You really need to learn how things really work and then you can easily figure out how to fake things. That kind of process need to borrow the operational vehicle, capture the BMS messages and play these back by simple micro controller. Even 1EUR MCU can fake it. Sure, it must listen and soon as it sees the specific command, it must spit out the line and report the fake status. That way you can install dedicated BMS, what is way easier to find than that over priced garbage laren
Honestly... i'd pass on a car where the previous owner did donuts in... 😂
dude i am always saying remove the hybrid system all together..
Whenever I lift and carry something heavy and dangerous(6:17), I usually do it in sandals.
Yesterdays technology today.  Allow 3-6 months shipping.
It’s super annoying seeing flip flops and no PPE
I wouldn't call the way modern engines dumb. Sure, fuel, air, spark then boom but that doesn't mean itll last nor will you get the efficiency and power you need
Yes, water and damaged lithium always make for a safe work area...
Does anyone know where I can get a good performance Audi for a good deal? My budget is ~50k.
I turned the video off at 4:34 when Freddy started talking about play station~
How could those electronics be good 😂
I won't have a single thing to do with two car brands:  Tesla and McClaren.  Tesla because Elon Musk is a constipated neo-Nazi homophobic BIGOT,  and McClaren because their cars have the build quality somewhere between an '86 Dodge Omni and an '86 Yugo.  They are TRASH. They make nice noises, go fast, look cool....But they are TRASH!
did you just tell 1.43 million people your address
Flintstone footwear Playa
Guessing all the Mclaren's hybrid protocols and mechanisms based on "scanning buddy's P1" seems to be just pure insanity. Hope Freddy and Rich will succeed in this task - wish you all the best and a lot of luck guys.
Yeah unfortunately in America only the dumb are rewarded with enough money to buy McClaren. And they will never stop paying whatever these corporations want for them. The rich are just people who stay blind and do as they are told.
Please see how the original car works before doing anything.  This is not a normal hybrid,  This system is meant to work together with the ICE to suplement it, more like a KERS system. The first iteration of this system could not even run on EV only, that battery is meant only to store enough energy to give a kick to ICE when accelerating fast. EV only mode It is an afterthought... just for marketing and pass  regulations.
Can i get some more square body content please?
Love your ad within the ad. Genius.
I thought a123 file for bankruptcy in 2012?
Brilliant rich, great summery 🎉
RICH ?   YOU ARE FORGETTING.  THE TITINATE CHEMISTRY HAS TWICE THE CHARGE CYCLES AND ITS WAYYYY MORE STABLE CHEMISTRY THAN 18650’s !   🤷‍♂️
It doesn't matter how fast these things go. Electric cars are s***They are the epitome of retardation. Every single one was made by slave kids in Africa working. But with their hands digging a cobalt s**** y** and your environmental b*******. Electric cars are nothing more than fireboxes
That is suck a ripoff... they don't offer any support for a million dollars car that is a little over 10 years old...
RICH ?   Why not just get the 3.2 volt lithium Titinate Batteries?   It would be half the size & batteries would be cheaper .   These are very stable power dense batteries.    Which I’m sure you probably know.   But you are building a pack for this car; I assume anyways.   Why not make it easily MAINTENANCE AND CALL IT A “UP GRADE”.  ?   These 3.2 volt batteries are 50$ each.  Buying in bulk you get them cheaper also.  🤷‍♂️ They are no such thing as “MACLARIN VOLTAGE” 🤷‍♂️. Lol.  It will work & maybe actually have a better pack in the end with a higher Load rating 💁‍♂️
The batteries were under sea water for hours. They won’t have any voltage
Why youtubers merch is a ripoff?
I just absolutely love your channel. You are absolutely about the truth
You should go 911 gt3. Works every time
Are those batteries similar to the Headway batteries?  Looks to be about the same size.
Tavarish really screwed up buying that McClearen. This is the second time watch a video of his car from a very simular video he posted. McClaren is know to add zeros to a part. Example: a McLearen  front frame peice cost$3,000.00. DIY GANG fabricated the McClearen frame peice for $300.00. McClearen are money hungry frauders! So I know your battery rebuild is going to be very inexpensive. You said the McClearen battery cost over $100,000.00. I think you can build one for $10,000.00. Good luck!
That's why I only buy Ferraris: To be ripped-off but, at least, with style.
Those batteries are safer than tesla lithium ion batteries, mclaren used lithium iron phosphate 4 batteries that can do more cycles and are more stable than lithium, the draw back is that energy density is lower hence the bigger size.
Tavarish to say that folk don’t dig you man with honour and love ain’t so, and to call you names that we don’t know nothing about McLaren. You shouldn’t move a P1 battery over none-ideal terrain in slides.
This is a problem that literally bothers no one...
That battery’s a monster
If they ditch the hybrid system, it won't be a P1 any longer. It will seriously effect it's value beyond the salvage title it already has.
Just uss 21720 batteries
That vacuum over the electronics though…
Would make more sense with a larger pack at same weight + more e-power! Otherwise I agree with the delete option, less weight and more power with built motor!
Arcimoto sponsorship?
MP4/14 all day
Definitely, Ditch the HYBRID and go for the full engine build. Especially with almost 500lbs less on the build. This thing will be a monster.
agre with you on scrubbing the hybrid drive
Yup delete it
“This is not me”
Rich, you nailed it! Just put a reserve gas tank in that empty space.
Up and comer lol
Dude where do I get that magic air gun!?
Why was the Jasmine rice sdrawkcab in the Shipstation ad?
Funny Rich pretending like we don't know who Tavarish is LOL
Lol I can dig dipper and get u that way less
*safety squint*
0:36 my man Rich says an up and coming youtuber named Tavarish.... who has over twice Rich's sub count lol
I own 4 of these cars in my dreams and neither are anywhere near as fast as my unicorn 🦄
The epitome of "first world" problems.
Ditching the battery is financially by far the right call, but nothing in this rebuild could ever be financially right. Plenty of P1 owners are watching this rebuild like a hawk and if you'd work out the battery there's financial gain due to clout, and owner interest cause most batteries don't last 15 years. 300+ P1 owners lining up sooner or later if you'd improve on Mc Laren.
that air nozzle sounds like a V1 flying bomb, I want one!
Nobody at McLaren ever thought someone would disassemble a P1s battery and find all the secrets.. Every car has the core charge to all parts and by restricting you to going back to the dealer, you'd never know the generic make of the parts.
When you were checking fuses for continuity, you just check that at least one isn't blown.
The Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU was released in 2013 for $1,500 Today you can buy the same part for $40 on ebay - so does that mean the original price was a ripoff? No  When did McLaren start developing that battery pack? Let's say 2011. How much have battery cellpack prices dropped in the last TWELEVE+ years? Something like 70%.  So let's say McLaren's in-house cost in 2011 was $80,000 to build the battery pack. They forward the charge to customers at $156,000 to recoup R&D costs. Now fast forward and bring that price down by 70% and we hit $24,000. That means today one could build the same product for a fraction of the cost BECAUSE prices have plummeted over time, not because McLaren was ripping people off.  Now BOTH are true at the same time. McLaren was heavily overcharging to recoup R&D costs and battery prices plummeted  But for anyone to attempt to make an argument that "I could build this today for 10% of the cost BECAUSE McLaren ripped everyone off" is factually incorrect.  This is on par with saying that Apple ripped everyone off by selling the iPhone 4 for $1,200 when I could buy that same phone today for $30.  How can anyone compare the build price today using 12-year-old technology and come to the conclusion that back then it was a ripoff?  This is a logic fail, period. Full stop.   Not here to defend McLaren, here to defend logic. Changes in battery technology is the overwhelming primary reason for the significant price difference over twelve years, not corporate greed (that is secondary).
Lmao if it doesn't run we'll push it into traffic and make a claim
Amazing such a small YouTuber like Tavarish could pull off this McLaren build.  So nice of Rich to bring some viewers to his channel.
Lots of good info in this video.  I think a simple way to go would be to buy the old battery pack from someone who upgraded their P1 battery.  Then re-use the controller from the old battery and replace the crappy cells with modern 18650 cells.   You end up with a system that will work and could be either much lighter or have much more energy for the same weight.   This is one cool project.  I hope you stay involved and post the progress on this project.
Well we knew it was a ripoff already lol
I say LS swap it
But didn't the controller on Tavarish car look ok ?
Absolute worst smell is battery corrosion dust.
You don't test a blown fuse in situ. You have to take it out.
8:50 "If they didn't blow, they didn't do their job." Fuses protect the external wiring against shorts and gross overloads. They cannot do a darned thing about an internal pack fault like getting flooded. With the car likely being off at the time it floated away, the battery contactors should have been open, which means there was virtually nothing connected to the fuses for the fuses to blow on. Nothing too surprising about fuses surviving being connected to water.
Why even buy HV gloves if you aren't going to protect/use them properly.
Please don’t expose the environment to this burned stuff.
"audi e-tron for sale" doing donuts in the background, weird way to sell a car
You do not have a clue what is energy dense battery and what's not.
Not really a huge point wearing your voltage gloves without the protective leather outer. If you get a pin hole in them from handling the things you’re handling the gloves are garbage.
Mclaren or some other big supercar makers should form a special team that does special stuff, and helping YouTubers make it across the finish line should be one of the goals.  Silently helping them with the last few bits.  You all took something that was set to be scrap, and are giving it a second life.  You can look at this like Ferrari, "our piece of art is forever ruined", or you can say, "art is making something that shouldn't be able to work again, work"
Safety squints for the win!!
Upcoming youtuber 😂 with more subs than you
The whole reason that car is still here is because it was submerged in water for days IMHO.  The battery burned underwater, hence why it was contained.  It's still super impressive, but I think being in water was paramount to this car still being a car.
The fucking parallel to console fanboys, Tav, I am coming back from a break to binge the fuck out of you and stay tuned in, you hooked me back with that breakdown
So step one is to hack the CAN buss ?
I want an ev kit for my 05 mitsubishi eclipse spyder gs
7:54 what air attachment is that?
did you try with AA batteries?
interesting, working on a broken battery without any inhilation protection...
Lost a lot of respect of respect over this, unsubscribed.
Haven't you see the video of their build quality? Gaps everywhere in the body, screws and bolts loose, much much more all on their new vehicles.
5:52 when adults joke about lifting with their back... then they actually do it lol. It's so funny how so many adults don't know how to lift with their legs... don't bend your back. Keep it straight... actually lift with your legs. Mostly just the guy on the left... but even the guy on the right has his back straight... but his back is still angled forward... causing strain on the back
Rich you mean to tell me you made an entire video just to drive home your point of dehybridizing Tavarish’s P1? 🤣
Love the video. Please just wear some kind of PPE when using the cutting disk. My god. Those things break loose and send pieces flying all the time. Safety squints won’t do it.
I'm following Tavarish but I'm glad to see this video because it's good to see things from this perspective regarding that McLaren P1. I don't get why they put that battery in this car because it ain't got much autonomy and it isn't a true hybrid.
how much for just the jasmine rice?
This episode was spicy! It was like watching a high suspense horror thriller drama!🤔...adventure! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
You Do know that Etron is French For TURD
Love the ECR Shirt Mid Video!!!
It's not funny to work on EV BATTERIES INSIDE YOUR GARAGE 🤣🤣
Let me have the e tron pls. 😂 awesome bro ive been watching your vids since your girl got mad beacuse you bough the first tesla.
Jokes "lift with your back, not your legs"... proceeds to actually do it. RIP that man's back in 15 years.
And people call the Demon overpriced....
Ultrasonic cleaner? Nah - I'm sure it'll come good if you put the whole thing in a giant bag of rice...
Love the N64 PS comment p And great video overall, cheers guys.
i thought that was you amd Tarvarish i seen on the way home 😅😅😅
YOU THINK SILICOSIS IS BAD YOU GUYS WILL HAVE CANCER IN 10 PLUS YEARS NO MASKES AND EYE PROTECTION GOOD LUCK.  LIKE YOUR VIDEO HOPE IT GETS DONE
Freddy brought me here 👍👍👍
Great Collab guys!! It does not matter what it is, 😂 everything in life is like this, cheaper to make then it costs to buy. Consumers are always paying for research, development, warranty, "new" ," bespoke", "high quality" " Brand name". You will always save #$ putting your work , your thought, your knowledge on top of, bettering, building off of other techs and technology s and adding the advancement over time, you will always save $ and the more you understand,the better you are at building, integration, cost management, yes you will save $. Now you change the whole cars battery or engine design, you will likley definitely make it better, however, people who are buying this high end bespoke rare one of a kind vehicle, want it STOCK, the way it came, not a totally unique one off that if and when it brakes will need anouther fix, a one of a kind, bespoke, good luck kind of fix...  Then again this is already a flood salvage car, screw it... lol anyone whos gonna want/ touch this already totally unique rebuilt ride is going to have a full video series documentary on every change, every detail, why every decision was made, all the costs & benefits literal and figuratively clearly laid bare, everyone service... well everything.. Someone in the end will end up eith a real GEM, i can only hope it doesn't sit in a lonely garage, but gets shown& driven like all cars should, yet so many cars of this ones caliber just sit hidden away idles by rich people... Speculators...  God bless you and yours everyone who had the patience to read this full ran. .message!
He spent 600k on that oh mi lord
What's the fancy air compressor thing?
Like the vid, hate the audio. Could you fix it please?
12:28 That is a professional tier safety squint right there, learn from this man kids; the technique you see on display here could one day save you an eye.
Mate, you are missing the point of the hybrid system in your conclusion at the end of video. The hybrid system was never for eco purposes, its designed for torque fill for the V8. The hybrid system is essential to the car and the way it performs. It is part of the essence of the P1
He got 8t for 575k he told us he got it for 1 mill what a fucking lier
Die grinding without glasses lol
this mf has 2 sponsored ads in 1 video XD scumbag
Hey Rich, I have been subscribed for donkeys years but your vids are not showing up in my feed - is this the same for everyone else?
up and coming youtuber named tavarish bros got more subs than you wtf u talking about ??? lol clown
Jay Leno has a P1
Submergence in water destroyed that battery but it seems to have "saved" the car from a complete meltdown.
those ebay batteries will be fake, counterfeit. All capcitors, transistors etc.. most batteries of this kind on ebay are fake.
I totally agree! Save your money and time and chuck all the hybrid drive bullshit IN THE BIN where it belongs! And let me just say Mclaren spare parts and servicing is a downright scam!
Look at all that environmental friendliness.
Great video…
Wakey wakey.... all super cars are a rip off. Designed for the rich to tell everyone else how successful they are...
A Tesla Model S plaid battery is cheap compared to a McClaren P1 battery.
Bad advertising the Audi  burning broadies. Says needs new tires plus it's been beat on. It should be it a field of daisies with the swedish bikini team nude sunbathing. And having pillow fights
Ooh! All that lithium and cobalt and nery a hazmat suit in sight.
Enjoy the way you promote your shop! Keep up the good work bro.
Blowing on the ignited battery pack, really? Did it help??
Hammer & chisel to disassemble battery pack!! No need to try & repair stupid human (that's reality for most humans) that believes it's environmentally friendly!! It was completely submerged in water but caught fire, even the fuses (for safety normally) never blew?? Throw it out & overpay for a new one. Yes stupid humans indeed & you'll accept it.........
yo i think that was you rich
That was an excellent analysis and made great sense.  Ditch the battery.
I would love to see you CAN-Bus sniffing. This could be a great series of videos 😎😀😎
ditch the hybrid crank the boost. you're a G rich. You get it <3
if you ditch the hybrid system inthe P1.then the i pass button is no longer working .
Was kind of hoping that an upgraded p1 hybrid system get built. But then seeing a light weight boosted  p1 might be more interesting
Ain't no body sane want that Audi at that price.
I didn't even think about ditching the hybrid system. 😂. I'm dumb like that sometimes 😂.
gotta get me some of those steel toe slides
up and coming? he is here sir lol
Please try stand up dude lol
Rich's rebuild's concerned face
I learn a lot and laugh a lot and Rich’s videos.
Freddie: "lift with your legs not your back: Also Freddie: *lifts with back*
Car without the battery hybrid system would be worthless. Maybe same price as a 720.
Keeping the hybrid would be cool from the perspective of it being a true spiritual successor. But many this video paints just how painful that would be to pull off
I always thought the McLaren was crap quality and not impressive at all. Nsx all the way when we talk speed and quality
In case anyone is wondering, the address at 1:17 is for a random strip club
2 ads… really?
warning the high voltage latex gloves arent good for high voltage if they have a pin prick in them. thats why electricians/lineman always wear the leather gloves over them. the salisbury leathers are very supple bro.  but for 600v dc and lower i dont think at that potential itll find your hand skin and short out.. unless your skin can touch the metal of your ratchet or wrench or whatever through a big tear or cut in the latex
I really appreciate the amount of work you put in these videos. It's a joy to watch. Keep on going. This is great!
The only non-hybrid P1 in existence would be pretty cool to me🤷
I understand using kerosine to wash my hands after wrenching on a 200 I6 ford was a bad thing to do in retrospect- I cannot wrap my head around you blowing burnt battery into the air without some kind of respirator.  I appreciate what you're doing but that's just not safe I'm surprised you've not gotten an osha investigation behind this.
John's safety glasses:       squints more
The product placement is strong with this one!
Nice !
was just waiting for Freddy to fall in those flip flops lol
You just getting started with the disaster of that system. You will probably be better off to gut the entire electrical motor / battery. This is the problem with repairing a modern electric vehicle.
i thought tavarish never reveal hoe much he buy the P1
Great video
No matter what .. I could never trust salt water soaked electronics ... They  may work one day... But as corrosion sets in.... They are just waiting to fail.
Does Rimac have a solution ?
575k   When its been SOAKED in SALT Water which renders everything pretty much TRASH except for body panels...   I mean I dont know much about these cars but Im guessing the ENGINE could be saved? but absolutely no electronics .... Yet it still went in auction for 600 K!     TRASHED like that ... WOW... just WOW LoL..
Car took a shit
To be fair, McLarens are a rip-off.  They're nice cars, but not worth the price.
8:40 All those fuses are between 2 aluminum buss' and I don't see them branching off into different circuits on either buss... which is kind of odd. But what I'm getting at, unless there's stuff going on I can't see, all you know right now is that 1 fuse is good. Or there's been a short somewhere. Looks like you need to isolate those fuses to check them. That battery is a god damn mess...
Lol @ Rich making a hairline joke😂😂😂
1:16 bro just leaked his address lol
I strongly suspect that McLaren's products in general are all over priced.
Pretty sure he overpaid for this heap by about $570,000.
I'm doubting that they get the battery system much less the car ever working again.
I am not at all surprised it was not a hermetically sealed pack, too much to ask from a two million dollar car.  But they fished priuses out of the harbor in tacoma and the batteries all seemed to end up on ebay in perfect condition.
This is why an electric car will never be on a channel like Vicegrip garage! Not with todays tech at least.
Omg I thought you were going to just throw it away, good job guys very eco friendly
I watched  Freddie video on this and both times I heard him say the fuses didn't do there job, I suspect they didn't blow because the whole battery was submerged in a conductive liquid (salt water)...so the current wasn't just flowing through the fuses alone, hence them not blowing. Keep up the great work de mystifying electric cars and electronics in general.
Part it out
If he can do the delete but retain the option to reinstall the hybrid later if the resale made sense he absolutely should.  Get it running without hybrid as stage 1.  Should be much quicker.
Then why the f u buying it then if your grumbling about the price you don't make sense period
Hold up.  N64 vs Playstation isn't a competition.  It's Playstation hands down.
loooooooool
1:43 Brattery 🤔 🤣🤣🍻
Why does Rich look younger, WTF's going on!!! 😡
Louis Rossman: Did someone say ultrasonic cleaner?
I pray to God.    A 150.000battery deal.  Please kill me.  Fick that.  God bless America 🇺🇸 and Americans vote republican save America 🇺🇸
Hey Rich, have you ever thought of electrifying the Sherp?  Surprised you haven’t done that yet.  Also, being that we’re both in Texas, how would you feel about electrifying my sailboat? It’s been done before but I’m honestly curious what twist you’d put into it!
Ugh.  Timing.  I'd be on top of that Audi if I weren't buying a house!  Thanks for the continued great content, Rich!
Make it a Track car!!!
Love you conclusion!!👍Tavarish listen to Da Man!!
I dont think the easiest route is the most interesting one. At all. I think rebuilding a better hybrid system sounds a LOT more enticing. Probably not a lot of people watching his channel today understands much about hybrid electric systems or EVs and this is an excellent opportunity to get into the nuts and bolts and become a little smarter.
Looks like MacLaren's hybrid is driven off the engine belts, not some kind of standalone like what the Hybrid Corvette is going to be (or how the PHEV Mitsu Outlander is). Like, if you can nab another P1 and do some CANbus sniffing take a look? But I feel like Freddy is gonna be better off loosing that hybrid system, assuming the delete isn't as complex as a handbuilt replacement.
It probably doesn’t have flooding sensor!! Lol that’s why fuses didn’t blow!!!
Please folks......Wear proper sandles when carrying a 500 lb battery 😅
If it was a lithium batter, it was probably burning underwater, no?
19:40 smaller isn't always better in terms on batteries. Those bigger ones has more surface to dissipate heat, an arc enemy of lithium based batteries...
dhgate 17$
Tavaresh really should lay off those tight shirts bless his heart
“Up and coming YouTuber Tavarish”…wow..he’s one of the biggest automotive ‘tubers’ ..lol
Next Tavarish video: “I bought Whistlindiesel’s Ferrari”
Only it wasn't a toilet if you watch the video of the car being recovered.
"Up and coming" is a bit of an understatement
Is it possible for salt and rust corrosion around the fuses to allow enough current flow to show continuity?
I’m a procurement manager you can by a 76 cell a123 for like 400$
It's a rip-off because it cost $156K, enough said.
Nifty video.  Always interesting to see what's being used in the different battery packs. But my real comment - Two words: SAFETY GLASSES.
Put an LS in it
5:51 "Lift with your legs, not with your back". "OK" --> proceeds to lift battery pack with his back..
Instead of moving the truck close to the load, pick up the load by hand and walk 30 feet 😅
$600k for a flooded car is a rip off by any standards...
1:50 scared the shit out of me. i thought the car fell on them
Hey when you guys were under the car all I was thinking about was the front of your hair Tavarish that's awesome It's really coming in👍
A very prudent recommendation. The car will never be original, so go ahead and make it better.
So a dude sold his destroyed Mclaren that was destroyed by a hurricane. Did he claim insurance before the sale? I bet he did.
I hope you are able to get specs so you can build a modern battery for a fraction of the cost of a new one (if a new one even existed). Or ditch the hybrid system.
The multimeter setting was on Amps. 11:00
156k battery built with cheap parts by overpaid techs. Not surprising.
Overrated fuggin cars. "buT iT hAs a cARbOn bOdY"
Really thought it was dumpster time at 6:05
“This is not me” 😂
Love tav has flip flops on while carrying 100kg
That air blower thing  is called a Tornador if you're like me and have never seen one.
Hello , love  the Audi kindly donate it to me in East Africa . Kenya .. Im in love with the Audi .
My man called Tavarish an up and coming Youtuber. 😂
Yes those battery packs do look like apartment blocks. Apartment blocks in a war zone like those  in Ukraine attacked by Putins mob
I got a better explanation from this video than from Tavarish. Good job Rich.
That was a very nerdy end to this interresting  video, loved it !
2 of my FAVORITE builders on the same video :) ~ Put an LS in it 3:)
My Boii in FlipFlopss
Ian.  Just an FYI.
You’re wrong about the cell being easily replaced by an off the shelf cylindrical. The A123 cylindrical isn’t made for energy density. It’s made for POWER density. Very specialist design and nothing like an energy optimised cell in a Tesla. 19:41
That is the car that he can't and won't fix..
What kind of air nozzle is that?
3:00 *"Stevon still at community service"* and *"How to remove an ankle bracelet"* 😂
What kind of air hose gun extension is that?
Physics made fun… who knew after leaving school I’d be learning more from a car show that my professor 🤪. Great channel; informative and interesting 👍
make it full ev do a telsa swap
wow ,, what a project , well done.
You guys should get yourself one of those nifty Mercedes Sprinters as a transport work horse instead of the inefficient pickup truck. Or a Fiat decato (RAM) or Ford Transit. Much more practical, and cheaper.
I want the hybrid drivetrain to stay.... At minimum, if you rebuild the pack with 32700's instead of the original 32113, you could potentially increase the pack's capacity from 1512Ah, to either 3276Ah or 3640Ah, (of course, that depends on how the overall pack is wired). Losing 43mm off the length of the batteries would mean that you could move from 5 'packs' to 9 (for a slightly smaller overall package) or 10 (if you want to go with a slightly larger overall package), which is where the 3276Ah and 3640Ah come in. Combine with advances in DC fast charging and a brushless motor (assuming the original used a brushed motor), and it would not surprise me if you could increase the mileage range into the high 30's or low 40's, with the stock 9minute charge time. At that point, the EV mode becomes ALOT more realistic (and potentially ALOT more fun.
Yeah, I’d ditch the hybrid as well. Lesser weight more power.
I love thé sécurité shoes or the owner or the car. No mater how genius you are Wear sécurité shoes when lifting heavy loads like a baterry 😉
That's the car's battery? Goodness!
I hope Freddie takes your advice and gets rid of the batteries
What about super capacitor like in Lamborghini?
Why not a McLaren? Cost of smiles per hour. For the price of the battery, I could build a Corvette that would destroy it on the road racing circuit.
Richard explained how to lift the battery and the guy didn’t even comprehend what the proper method is health is wealth
man, I absolitely LOVE this channel
Lmao Uncle Rich actually has on closed toe shoes today
No safety glasses lol real pros min 12:35
I got fucking golden banana'd
Awesome channel, thumbs up for Tavarish shoutout
Thanks for having Tavarish on your show. He's really struggling at the moment!
That rice isn't /r/UncleBens, but it will still work. #mycelium
I see that makes a lot of sense. 400 pounds is a lot of weight to reduce out of a race
You should pull the fuses out to check them
lol even at ali express those cells alone are $3360 + probably a cool 1000 in shipping
This is the first video I watched from you, and I really liked it, but I don't think it's a p1 without the hybrid system. There has to be a way to make it all work with modern computing. Don't give up. I wanna watch it work out.  I'm rooting for you.
damn !
🤔🤔The question is Ritch, can you rebuild it and make it work🙏🙏 we need you ritch😭😭
You forgot the golden rule... ALWAYS lift with your back. Also LMFAO, did he actually BLOW on that battery fire?
Seems like the perfect candidate for a full EV conversion.
McLarens are beautiful cars but they are trash as far as build quality and reliability are concerned.  I would never spend real money on one.
bring back stevon for the love of christ
neighbors houses huh? Nice address
In 10 years, when all these battery powered hybrid drives fail, freddy could be the go-to man for getting a p1 to work correctly without the electric lady shaver interfering. As a wise Meaghan markle hating man would say.
I think a lot of the mark up on these hyper cars are for R & D.  Being they don’t sell a whole lot, the prices for individual components seem excessive based on the individual components added all up.
Carrying 150-200 pound battery in flip flops is the most florida things you can do.
that cell size is.. uncommon. it's a huge 32113. industry leader is the 21700, but top of the line commercial only has a 45 amp max discharge rate, while these A123 can achieve their rated capacity at 202 A. 2.5x volume, but 3.6x the discharge rate.
Ls swap. Lol 😅
What tool is that they were using to blast the crud off the battery? Sand blaster?
You're awesome bro
U did rdj dirty on that c10 build just wanted to say that
I mean yeah, Liions have better energy desity over a Lifep04. But the amp output of those A123 cells is insane (in and out), and can last for far more cycles. I think theres a good reason McLaren chose them over a normal 18650 or 21700
Tavarish says to lift with your legs and then immediately procedes to lift with his back! 😅😅 These two together is too good!!!!
Half the damage comes from the wreck and the other half is from the tow truck recovery.
I love the " This is stupid and I can prove it mathmatically" section 18:25
My man’s out here in flip flops 😂 you only got 10 toes to lose 6:30
Hurricane "Brandon".... The only hurricane in history, that is ripping off the entire USA. LET'S GO BRENDON.
McLean is a complete ripoffs..that’s why they are sold to ego maniacs . They will never be satisfied! That’s why they get more cars. My only guess is little dick!
What are the best batteries on this moment to make a battery pack
Love the AAP swag!!
Lol😂”pick any Florida hurricane” that killed me!!
Man 500k seems like alot....salt water is like cancer , you can get rid of the water but saltwater corrosion grows fast
Always love a good old safety squint!
Hey rich you know you could always buy a mclaren f1 or a gt40 kit cat sounds like it’s right up your alley and it’s surprisingly funny that we have the same list of favorite mclarens
I think we are driving around in  time bombs with these ev cars
did you doxx yourself?🤣
All I could think about was yall dropping that battery pack and that guy loosing all his toes.   Accident's happen fellas and it is important to wear proper PPE!!!
The big manufacturers of the worlds trinket's have been screwing the consumer for a long time. you should look inside older appliances or one of those old tv's,  nothing inside worth anything THANKS WASHINGTON FOR PROTECTING THEM AND NOT US  ALL THESE YEARS
A flooded hybrid McLaren, as coveted as any McLaren automobile is, is an absolute nightmare scenario. Surprised that Tavarus took the bait.  Hybrid's are a pure money grab as components fail into the future for ANY hybrid automobile made by any auto manufacturer and why hybrids exist. There is no value in a hybrid in terms of cost/benefit.  Any supplemental performance gain of an electric motor can be offset by greater ICE cylinder pressure aka forced air which not only reduces part complexity for higher reliability but also reduces weight for better performance.  Batteries are very heavy and have very poor energy density compared to gasoline.  Hybrids with their overwhelming complexity as demonstrated in this video exist for mfr profit because parts fail and there are more parts to fail with a hybrid and therefore more profit for auto makers. Society is a sucker for tech based upon ignorance.
lol 😂 this is hilarious but please give a progress update on a hyubusa truck
The car is ripoff,  why should the battery be any different?
cranking the boost wouldnt help that much as the main issue in the p1 is it widow maker characteristics (lack of grip) one good reason for having a hybrid system is the 4wd with toque vectoring. however i dont think it is worth it to design a new system unless you go ground up some how which is way more money
What air tool is being used @ 6:41 ?  Needle gun of some sorts? Thanks!
The reason why the carbon fiber tub surrounding the battery did not completely burn up is because the battery fire was completely immersed in water.
Did he say “lift with your back not your legs”??? That’s exactly backwards 😄
Rich just sounds like a really smart guy....I knew I should've stayed in school instead of the Marine Corps
Yeah just fool the system into thinking the battery is discharged and that's it
Everyone in the video will develop cancers in near future
The bag of rice sold me
Those bags of rice make a great medium for growing mushrooms.
nope ,there was only one and that was Lola!
Dude..F YouTube why did i get unsubbed? Ive been watching your work for years!
That rice is the deal breaker !!
I liked this video. Especially because of the attention to personal safety while lifting heavy and sharp items while wearing slippers and regular runners. I have so much to learn from you guys!
I'll buy the Etron if you EV convert my IROC  as part of the price :). 500hp, 200 mile range.. deal? :)
rich full rubber gloves.. his guys, MEH?! :)
“Up and coming YouTuber Tavarish” man, I heard about him years before you 😂😂.
Math done with a hammer and chisel. Checks out.
yo cool video, great content, can we maybe get some masks and protective glasses for the brand, you guys inhaling mad fumes out here
Holy shit the fucking battery burning inside that carbon and the rest of the car not being totally engulfed in flames is a true testament to their engineering. I'm sure most of the people viewing this channel are aware of how insanely hot those fires get and how catastrophic they can be.
@5:50 “Remember, lift with your back, not with your legs.”
this channel has really gone downhill
at least they didn't forget their safety squints
Hold on, up and coming youtuber come on man this man made it to youtube standard.
Dudes lifting in slides should be in jail.
Don't know much about this stuff for forgive my ignorance, but isn't the battery in the middle of the car actually good for this rear engine car, helping with traction and weight distribution?
My vape pin has a better battery than a multi million dollar car wow
Tavarish actually did lift with his back, on the other hand rich has beautiful form
I really hope Rich Rebuilds this car. ....see what i did there.
You talk to much
156k.... shit I could buy a GTR ALPHA for that price 😮
The way humans are going wrong with tech is that they think that using mass to create power and create the power of a battery and that's not always the same
When M5?
Carrying that battery by hand like that is like holding a bucket of gun powder while smoking a cigarette 🚬 😅
17:20😂😂😂 Engines are dumb pistons cranks and shaft😅
You are one bad ass sir my hat goes off to you
Contact Peter Sripol, this mexican guy he knows everything there is to now for batteries and he can build you a more powerful one just with RC LIPO parts!
Scientific fact: the most annoying sound in the world is dragging a pallet jack across uneven concrete
Hybrid-schmybrid.  Get rid of that whole system because if you don't, you have opened Freddie's well-being to disaster!  Keep in mind if one little calculation is wrong, ka-boom!  The whole car...and Freddie may go up in smoke.  If McLaren engineered their hybrid to be PROPRIETARY and didn't want anyone to duplicate it, cracking their code will be fruitless.  There are so many ways to copy-protect computer software it would make your head spin.  However, if the car is simply repaired and rebuilt as a normal internal combustion powered machine, there will be enough performance to satisfy everybody and it will be much safer.  I urge Tavarish to accept the fact that his P1 isn't stock AS IT LEFT THE FACTORY.  It's still a P1 but it will be a much safer P1.  Life is all about not doing really stupid stuff.  Dicking around with batteries like these is really stupid.  The car will be 400 pounds lighter and much easier to maintain and best of all, it will be safer if you sh*tcan the hybrid system.
Amazing work man!
The video at 4:00 😂🤣😭
im waiting on the m5 e60 new video,,,
manufacturers unnamed are going to be pissed when rthe boys build a 200 thousand dollar battery for 100$ at home hardware
Made in china.
That battery looks like a LiFePO4 38120 cell. You can get those 10,000mAh cells for ~$13.50/ea not taking into account wholesale discounts. A123 Systems is a defunct company that went bankrupt due to multiple large recalls. It's probably better not to get that brand cell due to the likelihood of picking up defective cells & those cells being at a premium due to the company going under. Edit: ah, nevermind. It's a weird size cell. "32113" :/
5:29 Close your eyes…    I’ll see myself out.
9:24 using barehands to shield any potential debris from the cut off wheel.. :)
love seeing you guys collab.  Two of the best in the game.
LS Swap!
Tavarish looks like the kind of guy who just stinks all the time from sweat.
Get the "CELL" out of there! What a "Cell out"! LOL!
Carbon delaminates with heat 😂  I know this from the Praga chief enigeneer they had a accident where the motor burned in a race car they swapped it and the parts that were burned. But not the parts were not visuall damaged. Next day in a cool down round the floor pannel came off and send the car flying at 200km/h😂 good luck with the carbon that "took the heat"
Freddy needs him some Keto
Your drawings are straight up art, don't sell yourself short haha
As part of the team who originally developed the P1 hybrid system there are a couple of important points to add!  1) we did this back starting in 2010!  Back then, everything was new, nothing was commerically available, we had to develop EVERYTHING, from the battery structure, the BMS hardware and software, the integration, the motor controller and the motor itself.  Yeah, today in 2023 those things are a lot easier, now not only can you buy a lot of these things off-the-shelf you can also buy the tools to develop them. In 2010 for example you simply could buy a HV DC battery simulator of the required capacity (and certinaly not in the lead times necessary for this project) so we had to make our own!  This pushes the engineering costs up massively, which brings me on too:  2) The "cost" of an automotive part is NOT dominated by it's BOM cost, and especially for low volume projects where it is the amortisation of the engineering cost and homologation / certification that is by FAR the larger contributor.  Yes, you can buy all the parts to build your own version of the P1 battery for around £20k (again, this is £20k today, in 2011, the cells alone were 4 times the cost!!!) but then get it worldwide certified to REG100, REG10 UN38.4 and the multitude of US market FMVSS standards and the cost skyrockets.  Then you have to look at the productionisation, logistics chain, waranty and durability, again, many millions of $$$ gets swallowed up!  So, could you make a "better" P1 battery in 2023, hell yeah, would it be cheaper, probably not in absolute terms, maybe in inflation adjusted terms, but is the original battery a rip off? HELL NO  🙂
Golden Banana
In Freddie’s video, he seemed to had found a guy… some old chap named Jay
bro you sound like the tik tok male voice
Tavarish is up and coming????   HAHAHAHA
Realy Rich Why would I want a Mclaren living on £4000 a year  What FN Planet are you living on ?😵‍💫
Sarcasm level = Legendary
Did Rimac make the original battery?
Is that what Freddie was up to at Jay Leno's garage, Scanning the Can Bus to get the battery voltage parameters?
lets see you design, construct, test and manufacture that kind of performance battery - your just making videos for the sake of the clickbait title and reactionary views - so sad how you do this
50k??? jeeezus its like 110k in europe. send it over rich and I`ll have it gladly
Can you personally build a better battery?
It's not like a loaded gun. Lithium-ion Batteries have the same Energy density as TNT! AND this is still a way lower energy-density than diesel-fuel! Yet these Batteries are often confined in durable materials...so explosions can happen...
Great content. I like that a few channels are rebuilding that car almost at the same time. The pushback from McLaren is next level but hopefully a common front between channels with millions and millions views might save those cars and be a great marketing stunt for McLaren...
Why not wearing masks?
Great explanation of can bud etc
3:10 "This is not me."  Lmao
That  E-Tron for sale is is tempting but I bet it'll be a nightmare to maintain that here in South Africa🥲
Those bats are gonna catch fire or explode 🤦🏾‍♀️
IMO the way hybrids should work is that the entire drive train should be electric, and the gas motor is just a generator. Traditional hybrid systems are just overly complicated for nothing.  I believe the Chevy volt did this but for some reason it never took off.  It seems like a concept that would be very scalable and easier to maintain/design if done right from ground up.
When I win the Lottery & purchase myself a P1.... Guess who's going to be in charge of battery maintenance?
Rebuilding these insane batteries is like trying to rebuild a Nuke! You don't know what's inside, how much damage is in there,  is it stable, will it create a china syndrome in my driveway???  I don't have any batteries like this but I do have 2 Lifepo4 270 AH batteries for my solar system.  They say they can't go up like other types of batteries but it a new technology who knows what the future holds? Wait wiki says the A123 battery is a Lifepo4 battery?  That's insane the 2 Battle Born game changers I have are huge and probably have them in it They cost about $3K each at 270ah. 12v  never thought a Lifepo4 battery could be used in a EV? They do charge fast and can put out a lot of power? They just don't like cold or heat the BMS will stop charging if they are too cold
Can I get the Jasmine Rice For dinner?
I laughed so hard when he said "The up & coming Youtuber, Tavarish" LMAO. I love this guys sense of humor. You know, even if Tavarish has x2 his subs haha
My takeaway is that more the computer crap in your car, the less likely it will be on the road in 10 years time. In the case of all these modern super cars, their time is numbered.
9:48 That's all I wanted He throws away the car hahaha the battery cover becomes his pillow case
What happened to the diesel tesla?
every car today is a rip off, nothing is worth what its costs not even close
Am I the only one just realizing rich says Brattery every once and a while lol 😂
The “carbon tub” is just carbon cloth and epoxy (high tech fiberglass) once it gets heated the epoxy loses its structural integrity. You can’t “fix” it. I spent a few years in manufacturing…
Very nice to see you give some exposure to up and coming Youtubers like Tavarish
50k for the etron....isnt that essentially an all electric A8? That's a ridiculously good deal. Is there anything wrong with it?
It's all fun and games until you lose a couple of toes 😂
That poor is300
The Stevon hiding was real lol
Ditch the hybrid system and spend the extra 50k on the motor 👌
I completely agree with ditching the hybrid system, I guessed this would be the case at the beginning. EV systems are far to complex to repair after catastrophic damage.
Come on Rich for the love your guys backs please get a pump truck, dont want to throw your back out too young mate, was painful watching you two carry it to the back of the truck, stay safe my brother you only get one body.
Lmao at DB's Golden Banana 😂😂😂  I knew it was going to be something hilarious.
Yeah - you aren't paying $156,000 for a Mclaren battery.  Likely you are paying for the insurance policy that Mclaren has taken out in case their battery spontaneously catches fire and destroys the vehicle and occupants.
hello i came because i saw the video on tavarish on rebuilding the batterry so now i have a question is it possible to build a powerwall or build a better version of it?
I'd like to see Rich help Tavarish build a better hybrid system. However, if the decision is made to eschew the hybrid system, I'd rather see the system replaced with an eBoost technology to facilitate torque fill.
The reason the Mclaren didn't burn to the ground is because they used A123 (LiFePO4) cells rather than Li-Ion cells.   The energy density is lower but they're far less inclined to spontaneously combust or sustain a fire if physically damaged.   Replacing that pack with Li-Ion cells comes with risks.
I knew as soon as I heard Freddie talk about the ruined battery that Rich would be getting a call and subsequent videos. I like it.
What makes him think fuses would blow?  Does he not realize nasty ass salt water is highly conductive and current needs to pass thru a fuse for it to blow.  Shorting a battery out with salt water will not do anything to the fuses.
That battery doesnt cost a fraction of what mclaren its asking and that car doesn’t cost a fraction of 2 million dollars. Overprice market for sure.
I love the safety flip flops while moving on the battery. Haha well played
Loving the safety squints at 12:28 😂
If these many parts and complications involved then it does not make any sense to have these system Freddy can just work on engine and more powerful
Hope Tavarish's haircut doesn't get this video demonetized.
The short and fire was internal to the battery, so the fuses wouldn't be involved.  PLease tell me you are buying new fuses...  Don't use that salt water encrusted shit.  Metal oxides are semi-conductors, which can do all sort of entertaining things.  THey can act as resistors and they can act as transistors and amplify signals...
I would have to agree with you ditch the Fing hybrid system?
DAYUM!!! If only I had the cash for that rice!!! Jokes aside though, I think you're bang on the money with deleting the E-motor, worthless tech that was pushed before its time and isnt worth the money, its just so old and inefficient at this point its not worth it.
Ok, you had me at the Market Basket jasmine rice!   *cries in living in Ohio and 100% missing Market Basket because I can’t get More for My Dollar here*
22:12 That guy doesn't like the idea of getting old.
Ok the rice bit killed me. The only way to fix wet electronics!
Golden Banana Strip Club ... 🤡    I recognize the parking lot tho...
Tavarish where did you get those safety slides at??
That jasmine rice good no joke
So is Tavarish the cheaper, Arab replacement for Stevon?
Might as well LS Swap it lol
Richard you must r&d a new hybrid system for the P1, superior in every way to McLarens. It is your destiny!
How do I not see the advertisement coming 😂
If Tesla's batteries are only 20 grand why is McLaren worth 156,000 just curious👍🏼😎🇨🇦
Remember kids, always wear your safety sliders when lifting heavy batteries.
Your accent and the market basket rice reminds me of where I grew up. Rindge NH
Talk to me about that blow gun.....
You know you have too much money when👍🏼😎🇨🇦
Hey, here’s an idea let me have that corvette c4  so I can rebuild my 91 c4 and thereby be a happy redneck.
Tavarish with the Latino old man slides 🤣 safety second….. maybe 3rd
Starting at 17:17 this gets really cool to me. Thanks Rich for educating.
i kinda a agree i would invest all into the engine and go from there
Everything on these cars is fifty times the price for the same parts
I see Freddie went with the japanese safety boots, why does that battery look like it's giving people cancer while they take it apart.
Rich you spot on .. same applies for the 918 .. loose some weight Tav!
"up and coming you tuber"😂
Totally agree,ditch it.
"Looks like a little apartment complex" in Chernobyl.
Anyone pushing EV as a replacement for IC should watch this and see why normal working folk will be forced out of car ownership.
The P1 is special because its hybrid plus the hybrid system starts the engine so he need it
The reason those fuses didn't blow is because the elictricity wasn't going through the metal contacts but instead through the salt water through the battery.  Additionally those fuses are commically large so they need a fairly massive amount of power to go through them before they blow.  slowly leaking electricity through salt water isn't going todo it.  You'd need a special type of breaker called a gfci breaker that detects when small amounts of electricity is leaking to ground.  Normal breakers just don't pop in those circumstances.
"this is not me" hahaha
If the carbon bathtub whistand the temperature of a burning battery its pretty much cooked. This car looks dead. You could make a track car I guess by retrofitting motorsport ecu and car management computer plus whatever transmission is a fit.
Rich start a business on electric automotive and i guarantee you you’ll forever be remembered in the history books. I would love to participate and be honored to be an apprentice of yours.
Going from this to tavarish’s video back to this reminds me you guys really need to get 4K cameras instead of 1080p. It looks like shit😂
Lmfao , the strip club address
Rhich the man talking sence.
My head has just exploded rich with all this info
You lying, that WAS you!!!
i can only imagine what the ecu thinks when the hybrid system is ripped out lol
I WILL POLITELY ASK YOU GUYS BRING THAT SAND BACK TO NAPLES FLORIDA WHERE IT CAME FROM!
Hybrid are a joke in anything except a Prius or a dedicated ev platform. Any vehicle built as a gas vehicle and then has a hybrid as a option the hybrid gets the worst highway fuel mileage. Unless u never leave town for any reason u never buy the hybrid. Carrying around a dead battery is not how u get good fuel mileage.
Tbf if you call this battery pack a rip off, so is literally every component of every hyper car ever made. A Bugatti brake disc isn’t 20k because it’s advanced/complex/expensive materials, it’s expensive because it’s a Bugatti brake disc. You’re paying for effectively bespoke parts for a limited run car. All these things could be built cheaper but the people who can afford these cars will pay the premium for oem/dealer parts without caring about the price and are effectively subsidising the development costs.
It seems like a slam dunk to put together a new pack with the Tesla 4680 cells.  Why not just do a custom pack?
what's that air gun used to "clean" the battery pack ?
😍 now funny will be when you make the battery and send the video to mclaran 😏 how fast they will low the price from 152 k 😅
Know your Limits and yes, this is massive effort for reengineering with high risk of messing up. Might be a nice place for a small luggage compartment.
Mclaren 🥱🥱🥱
Nice to see that they use LiFePO4 and not LiPO/Li-Ion. That's likely why the fire was more contained than what you would have expected.
Freddies' buddy = Jay Leno LOL
I agree.  Trying to make a new battery and integrate it into the car is too expensive, and just asking for problems.
measuring components in circuit ?
FREDDY T is a up in coming YouTuber? With a million more subscribers, where's that put you, Rich?
World Famous Golden Banana
Yup.   Ditch the hybrid.
Rich, fascinating and informed breakdown of the problem here. What's your thoughts though, on the loss of additional low down torque from the electric motor? I guess car provenance is not an issue anymore, but the absolute trend now is hybrid hypercars (if not fully electric)... Saying all of this, Freddy said he'd never sell it anyways! 🤣
To test a fuse properly you should really remove it, you could be measuring back through another circuit, plus you should check your multi metre on a known source of power first to confirm your multi metre is working.  Otherwise love you 😘
How about find a Nissan Leaf donor and use its motor and inverter in place of the P1 electric motor?  (cough... cough... gag)
Headway 38120HP
McLaren must be pushing stupid amounts of money into these channels to keep itself popping up here and there. I bet Fab Rats and Trail Mater will soon have them  in their episodes too. Oh, and AvE.
Ali express has them for $14.09 each
Looks like Headway Cells!
Least clickbait title I’ve ever seen on YouTube. That battery truly is a ripoff on so many levels. I bet after the carbon fiber, logic, cells, etc. the battery was probably like $15,000 and Mclaren just added a 0. All for a system that also happens to be basically worthless.
I like your videos, but what about the nature? What did you do with the old parts and cleaning it outside.
Super interesting video! Great suggestion about removing the hybrid system. It definitely makes more sense, even for the next owner after Tavarish (if he ever sells it).
Uncle Rich school of batteries
Ditch the hybrid system!
Bruh, Rich been lifting, look at those arms!
Based on the salvaged title of this P1, removing the hybrid drive seems like a no brainer. Might be the blueprint for other P1 owners who don't want to deal with replacing a $156,000 battery when it fails. You could probably fit a couple decent sized tanks of nitrous in the space where the batteries went.
Stick Leenda in the boot and I’ll buy your etron.
So Freddy now has a Mrunk. Not a Trunk or a Frunk.🤣 (Middle Trunk)
720 engine tuned with all the bells & whistles to the max and ditch that hybrid system would be my choice too.
Rich, myself I love technology but on this project I’m on you’re side money wise and lots of trouble less. Good thinking Rich !!!
I agree 👍
Good comment about a loaded gun. I think you are going to need a new battery maintainer.
Ah the good ol’ Golden Banana
dropping the ball rich! dropping the ball!!!
Love the heavy duty flip-flops! Steel nose was an option I assume ;-)
"N64 vs Playstation" 🤣
Safety third is the best solution to everything;) KeepITup!
It’s time for Freddie to accept the bald life…
That's my pen!
Man... Tavarish (a good guy) is no Leenda, so... no like for "the bald eagle"
Ship station? I thought it was Sherp station as you advertising it from inside your Sherp! :P
If he can’t rebuild the factory system, the entire build is useless.  A P1 is a hybrid, rebuilding without that it’s just a normal Mclaren.  Should have just bought a brand new 720’s for hundreds of thousands less.  I hope this build doesn’t financially ruin Tavarish
Would it be a better idea if he were to make someone an offer on their dead P1 battery, like if someone needed to replace one and was planning on spending the money with McLaren, I'd imagine there is a core charge for the old battery. So core amount + $10k or something to get a dead battery that has a good working BMS and just 10 year old dead cells in it. Either replacing the cells for $8k or if you want to get fancy assemble a pack with newer, better, smaller cells to make a lighter battery that performs the same? I feel like having working electronics solves the R&D issue?
why is video flipped horizontally?
Tavarish said “remember to lift with your legs and not your back” than immediately does what he says not to do lol oh and in sandals
not since The Tiger King has something captured my attention like Freddy's P1.
how do i get that air horn attachment for my blowgun?
Flip flops had better days than this one on freddie lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Put the audi e tron system in the P1
Quick tip, when selling a car, don't show it doing burn outs an donuts in walmart carpark.
Nice to see you working with Freddie ❤
Ingage battery acid safety squints
That was a really good one!!
mclaren batteries are like glizzies
It would be best to eliminate the hybrid system lighten the car.
Anyone screenshot and see his web browsers? Is that an indication where Stevon has been?🤔😳 3:00
8:55 that is not what that means at all. A fuse is only meant to blow if the current through them exceeds a threshold. What happened there is water getting in and bypassing all the electronics which is a failure in any seals designed to prevent water ingress.  Saying the fuses didn't do their job is like saying the bouncer didn't do their job when the uninvited guest busted through the roof instead of the front door he was told to guard.
Rich you can do it. Show McLaren your ideas a better.
Tavarish N his steel toe sandals😂
Your right Rich! I pull the casing off my slim jims then smash them in a vice so i can eat it quicker.  Great minds think alike!
Isopropyl and toothbrush that ho! Honestly im just sitting here eagerly awaiting how many of those cells are still good. Im betting 90% edit- didnt know these shit batteries were from 2013. They skunked. Great vid tho!
Do you offer your own financing?
I had both N64 over PS1 any day.
0:57 that's hilarious, someone has enough to buy one but is too dang stupid to get a building that doesn't flood?
Ok at 11:28 Rich says "you dont squeeze it then eat it?"... I thought he was talking about........   eating a tomato😎
In the opening comments with the orange mclaren model reminded me last night i come out of my corner store and there sat a new C8 corvette in bright orange (one of my fav colors, matches my snap on box) the owner said it was a $1000 special order color. Can anybody confirm that? I have no reason to not believe the guy im just curious about special order and rare colors on performance cars. You would think id be a mopar guy with that way of thinking, and of course I love old mopars as i do love all old musclecars. With that said i grew up as a GM guy and always will be. Still have my first car, a 1970 Oldsmobile 442, originally code 28 twilight blue. Forgot what chevrolet called it but ive seen many chevelles in this color too. My car is currently in a disassembled state, what us feller car guys like on this channel call a roller.
I thought that was a fake ending at first, you know, like the one's porn stars have...
650s is best
F trying to rebuild the whole convoluted hybrid system made of bespoke dated tech! im with rich, put the powerful reliable ubiquitous parts in and make it everyone's favorite McLaren!
You know what it's like winning the Lottery?  Having Rich as a Friend.  Dude, you are one awesome Bro!  I know RIch being smart does not sell YouTube Views,  but man do I enjoy it!   Keep up the great work you and your team does.       Also?  Can you go over Ship station in detail on a future video?   I got a LOT of stuff I want to sell on Ebay, and want to get that started.    Thanks Uncle Rich!
Man... you guys were RIGHT next to my shop.
Ehm did you ask Chad? I am sure he can figure it out 😜
What about a whole new brain , like a link or haltec and a stand alone for the hybrid system  .. I know some ecu are can bus capable but idk if this would be feasible and of course what it would do to the value of the car I could see it only being worth going custom if A you already have a buyer lined up or B you have no intentions on ever selling it ?
I don’t know anything about this. But, I suspected that the electronic handshake to the rest of the computers and such would be the issue.
Obviously Tavarish would entertain us to the fullest, although rational to ditch the battery it won’t be as entertaining. Same for you Rich, build one that won’t catch fire and it should be fine lol
what is that air blasting gun used at 7:50????
Holler at Will Prowse for battery help and rebuilds!!!!
I wonder if he really doesn't have a 720S? I saw him flexing on the 991 page the other day,saying he did. Maybe he got a wrecked one to rebuild,  or that blue one is his 🤔, or maybe... He's just a liar 😮
I wonder if the Formula E technology went in to making those McClaren batteries.  Nice job!
Wow! Talk about a handmade battery!
Is it just me or is Rich the man 👍😉
You and Tavarish are amazing. Fearless.
Wtf where do you live that two houses doesn't cost 600 grand? Where I live you can't even get a one bedroom condo for that much. Canada sucks ..
Deleting that stupid hybrid system is the way to go.
Joke about using all back to lift the battery and then do just that. Love your work guys
The bonus rice would be more appropriate for selling a Kawasaki 😂
Did anyone else lookup what is located at 151 Newbury Street, Peabody, MA? Nope? Just me? ok.
Every YouTube channel owns one, because they are unreliable, and you can get them beat up, broken-down, far too expensive to fix, and on the cheap.
I really appreciated your explanation at the end.
Everything about them is a rip-off. The car itself is vastly overpriced, comprable cars cost way less. Then they break all the time, and all of their parts cost triple what comparable parts for comparable cars cost. Complete rip-off. If MacLaren make a reliable car, then maybe. Until then, Koenigsegg. Vastly Superior car, lower price tag.
i think id be in ppe
...tavarish is a trash individual...
At $3k for twice the range it's almost worth it to start a business selling upgraded battery packs for hybrids and EVs. I know I'd pay to get more range out of my Pacifica PHEV.
I think without your expertise he would be screwed.
Probaby the only way to keep it hybrid is go full standalone with some top-end stuff like Motec that supports integration of EV... i think that reverse engineering of oem data streams is not with it...
Lol let me get the Etron
Doesn't take a genius to know that with a lot of supercars you are paying for the exclusivity and the name.  The cheaper parts a manufacturer make the internal assemblies from the higher the margins. $1000 coach and prada bags are ripoffs too unless you want them for exclusivity and bragging rights.  Koenigsegg probably has more bespoke custom designed parts worth what you are paying.
Ok now let’s start building the P1 Pro Max Battery
Get rid of that hybrid system!!!
“Lift with your back not your legs”“With a twisting / jerking motion” 😂
You can't say that! you don't know how much was spent on R&D, or Proprietary technology, or the cost to roll these out. Id amazed someone who seems smart make such a Stupid Statement.
Loved the explanation at the end
Hyper cars come with hyper prices
Rich... How's Steven???
What year is that E-tron
NYC high rise after nuclear blast!
With the push to electric this fire guard technology HAS to be part of every electric vehicle sold. Battery fires are nasty,  fast, and kills without any way to put it out until it is done burning. Crazy it was suppressed to the battery compartment.
yeah, my Rav4 Prime gives 40-50 EV miles from an 18 Kwh battery where as spending all that money to get 1 or 6 miles of range makes absolutely no sense to me considering the 400 lbs weight. I agree you are better off just building up the engine a bit to get more power out of the engine and simplify the entire setup.
Real men, raw dog, their eyeballs well Grinding😂
What he really ought to do is LS swap it
It just proves once again that the markup on products these days has gotten absolutely out of hand.
LS6 swap. Why not? Mclarens are beautiful but they are pretty terrible cars.
@DalasEVRepair has done some great work on CANbus hacking. Maybe you guys should collab.
Is the etron still available?
Did you try putting it in rice?
3:00 "Stevon still at community service" 💀💀
I love the journey guys - make sure you dont take it too seriously - if it was ed china he'd replace the hybrid with an in car coctail drinks dispenser and race it round the nberg - glad to find your channel Rich
When you guys were walking it out to the truck, I thought you were going to throw it in the dumpster.
Hmmm...it already has the components to provide electrical drive into the engine though right?  Hear me out here...would it not be at all possible to make a super/ultra capacitor unit which could be used in place of the battery which only fires up when you step on the loud pedal?  They could be trickle charging up in the meantime using the KERS components (which I'm assuming it also already has)...which, as if I understand correctly, shouldn't take all that long.  That way, you could mitigate flatspots in the drive, likely reduce a bunch of weight, not have to worry so much about cooling, and likely have the fastest accelerating P1 on the planet.  It just seems a shame to have all the electrical whistles and bells to just not use them to me.  You'd also have a McLaren which is more F1 than the actual McLaren F1.
This was a nice and clear explanation. Good job!
This was a huge waste of money. I don't even thing Hoove would have bought this.
Yesterday's tech was supplied today at 2040 prices. 😢😢😂
Totally agree delete it. Could always throw an extra fuel tank in there and have a decent fuel range. Sandwich storage, water injection, the possibilities are endless... if you count 3 as endless.
Nice
Freddy should use the space for another gas fuel cell
"up and coming youtuber"?!?!?!  Are you going to take that Freddy??
I keep hearing about this guy who destroys expensive cars. I am so glad he has never been recommended to me. I prefer quality content like this over stupid content like that.
Them batteries are cheap as chips on Ali express 😂
Freddie should ask Jay Leno if he can get the canbus data from his P1.. he already went to visit him and see it
Loved your conclusion.
It was worth having a look at how it works but yeah defo with you on this Rich ditch it and save the weight 😉 great explanation 👌
"Up and coming Youtuber" I've been watching Freddie longer than I've been watching Rich. Thanks Car Trek...
Hey rich - nice pen. My grandma has those for her business and they’re good
It might be most cost effective to rebuild the battery just to not have to fool the cars computer.
Keep in mind that the hybrid battery can put out much more current/power in a small package than a tesla module.
$156,000 battery? There is no such thing. This is complete BS. The company that made the battery for the Mclaren P1 has gone bankrupt and parts are hard to find... But there are a couple of companies over in England that make new batteries. More modern. For a hell of a lot less than Mclaren P1 prices.
"The fuse didn't blow"  That's funny.  They applied Apple design to a car!
Id bet that battery compartment would look a whole lot different had the car not been submerged in water when it likely went 💨
I hate ads but when rich does his square space plug, I love it. It's always done so comically.
Freddie lifting this battery in slides is wild
I donated $4k to A123 Systems a year before the end.

If you don't gut the battery system out altogether, then use the controller from a Tesla with the Tesla battery pack, the voltage only has to match the electronic motor that way.
this is iron phosphate battery and not like  regular LiPO battery.
The only use for a hybrid system is for driving back to the pits after leaving the race track to help with cool down or leaving someone's mom's house in the morning so you don't wake the kids up since they have to go to school.
Carrying something heavy while walking backwards in flip flops is some of the most Florida Man shit ever...
I want your etron! But one small problem I don't have 50 Gs
someone please buy that stupid fucking Audi please so we dont have to keep seeing Rich try and flog it off for some imaginary bargain price 10 times in every video... thanks.
EV battery packs appear to be slightly sophisticated versions of radio controlled hobby car battery packs. It’s time to cancel the EPA’s EV mandate that is killing off ICE cars.
3:10 "This is NOT me." 🤣
That is hands down one of the best explanations on the hybrid system, and batteries that I have ever seen.  You almost dumbed it down to a level that I could understand too.  Thank you for this video!
The one thing I don’t think you’re considering is the tire technology is huge the P one is 10+ years old now the 720 ass is rolling around in new tire technology setting track times
I thought it was a Q-36 space modulator.😁😁😁😁
WD40 Spray will fix that battery right up. 1000%
battery : $30 McLaren name on it: $155,970 🤣 how about making the thing full electric ?
Whats the best way to get ankle monitors off Uncle Rich?
Join us on the next episode of suckers for pain 😂
Everybody knows recycling don’t go well. Imagine a bunch of them in the landfill.
I agree with Rich disregard the hybrid system. Or find a P1 battery that is bad, and harvest the electronics and build the battery section. Granted a bad P1 battery that hasn’t been disposed of is still a needle in a haystack.
" An up and coming youtuber named Tavarish" 🤣🤣. That was funny.
Build a small light weight kers like system? I'd build a smaller pact at about half size and use it like a boost system.
Freddy  get that battery in the Bin! 😅 🙏
Even if he attempts to shed the battery he surely still needs CAN captures to spoof the ECUs in the car into thinking the hybrid system is there.  No? I suppose you can have a custom ECU, but I imagine the infotainment must be trying to display voltages, so then you also have to mess with that too.
Wow, I love how you break it all down and explain everything! Amazing, brain power (mega pack) size!
John working with the math with a chisel and Hammer is a genius 😂😂
question is, what will McLaren's ECU think without seeing all the hybrid system?
why is a car in that condition worth more than a brand new porsche/ferrari/...?
He $hould part out tho$e car$ and buy a new one.
I love the production quality of tavs channel, but i also love the raw almost as if i am there quality of this video.  both are great
Freddy definitely should ditch the Hybrid system as you've said.
You dont want to do it like that  You want to do it like this
And That My Friends is why Freddy went to seek the help of "The All Mighty " JAY LENO. to get some info and help from Jays' P1
Well...I will build that car with a front motor, front wheel drive, plug system, that will tell me when is dead so I can start the engine manually,  I know it sounds a beat dogge but well configured  will give you a nice silent drive, won't be as heavy and anyway you have to plug the car to safe the engine  battery so fine for a drive once in a while
That weird showerhead air hose attachment you used for cleaning, the one that sounds like a ww2 airplane. What is it called?
The safety squints in this vid show they are highly experienced technicians
Up and Coming YouTuber ??? 😁
i assume the car will go to sema , being this is really old footage,, prior to the tub repair
Can’t remember the hurricane huh. Could’ve spent two seconds and googled it and showed a little respect to everybody that went through it.
I'm really surprised no one was wearing a facemask or respiratory protections while cutting, roto-zipping and air blasting that crap from the battery with their face all up in it.
PERRRRFECT!!!
Rich, you waddle like a duck. Or a beautiful swan, can't figure out which. Nice waddle.
A123! I knew it was you! You bastard 😂
A twisty, jerky, motion.  Confirmed...that's the best way
Who cares... It is a useless car., nice to see, but useless. So it is a toy for the rich. Those people don't know the value of money anyway, so who cares. Let them pay for useless cars, if they are happy with it, and get the feeling to have something unique....for that's all it is, unique but useless....
You could probably get a battery pack up to 30 miles of range, that would be worth it
John, you should use safety glasses dude!
the rich sit down paper moment was honestly really unexpected but very nice you should do more of thoes
That 24 minutes and 24 seconds went by really quickly, love your deduction in regards to  really needing the hybrid system. That is a really tough one to call, do i put it back in or do i just leave it out as it really does not do much anyway.....   Tavarish scares me when i see him work, he really  needs to wear some safety gear, if he dropped that battery on his foot, that would be it...
How much were those cells in 2010?
Yeah nice shout .... Freddy should just go Motec / Syvecs or something! Would allow him to get SO SO much more out of his car and push it way further, and probably end up costing WAY WAY less. (although it might tank the value of the finished car sadly).
Dang som
The only thing that John the professor was missing was his high tech work bench that consists of a plastic trash can and a half cut sheet of 1/2 plywood, then John wouldn’t have been working on the ground like he was…😂😂😂! ❤️🙏🏻
McLaren recently announced it was updating the P1 battery. Did they do it? Google "McLaren Updates P1 With New High-Performance Battery"
This should get a Nobel peace price for the biggest scientific discovery of the year, that effects the fewest people!
Loved yr explanation of this P1 battery system....why couldn't school science be this interesting when i was growing  up😂
i liked the battery explosion. safety third!
I was honest to god sad when Rich said to just get rid of the hybrid system. It's such a cool tech in the P1, despite how old it is. Thing is though... Rich is 100% right. If I were Tavarish, I would go ahead with the delete.
7:30 Having intimate psychic ownership of a McClashin, is that a corrosive death cloud being haphazardly generated?
14:58 lol
So what is exactly the issue with this specific old hybrid system that makes it bad performace-wise? That it only can support up to a certain amount of miles per hour? Can you somehow take a different motor? Or is that impossible?
I have  been watching for a while now and I'm a big fan. I'm staying in China and I found these batteries online selling at $13 per battery without shipping. Love the  channel  Regards Chris
It was really interesting to see how the math breaks down with something like this.
Tavarish wearing his mom's sandals. :)
But didn't tavarish spoke with some guys in England that makes much better batteries and systems for p1 already at a much cheaper price? Why would he delete it instead of going this road
Still paying stevon off😮
21:00 NEEEEERRRRRDDDDDDD!!! 😎😁
And remember kids, always wear your safety flipflops when moving heavy stuff
As an indian the rice deal is very lucrative
He got ripped off!
That was a very nice video !!! And you are right..  - Keep this shit out and enjoy the ride !
LoL 🤣 onya Rich 👊🏾💥🤎
Nice work guys
Hey @richrebuild How about 46K ?  Jared would have had it done already 😂
Anyone paying over 500'000 for a car, new or used, running or not, well, these people have a real problem imho. It's over the top insane, too expensive with no guarantee it will ever run. But then again, Tavarish has fixed up a lot of cars. I naturally know nothing, they know way more.
Bang on!…Genius.
up and coming? Tavarish 2.6 million subs,  Rich 1.4 million subs
Or you just put a rear dual plaid Tesla setup into the front wheels and make it 4x4 with two independent systems-- engine powering the rear-- full Tesla setup in the front. Then you could stack those Tesla bricks in that same location as the other battery and actually make it a plug in hybrid with some decent EV range.   Still a lot of crazy work and a lot of components to buy.  So yeah--  just go engine only and don't be foolish. lol
You know the hybrid system sucks when an electric guy tells you just to delete it lmao
hybrid supercars are nothing more than a gimmick.
steel toecap sliders Freddie
I thought tavarish found a company in England that builds the battery better than Mclaren already in a previous video of his???
The P1 hybrid system whilst rudimentary was more about torque fill than just adding more power like with the F150 aka La Ferrari. Whilst some of the torque hole created by the OE turbos will likely be filled by the newer turbo tech Freddy is going for it will likely not completely fill it. Then you have iPAS where the hybrid / battery gives extra power when the button on the steering wheel is pressed, but I'm guessing Freddy already knows this. Ditching the hybrid battery gives you other problems so if an 'enhanced' battery can be designed and built, for the money he is already putting into this car having it's worth doing. If you ever have the opportunity to drive a P1 and a 720s back to back, they are very different drives. You are right in saying that in normal mode their track times are roughly similar, P1 in track mode is in a different time zone.
It's impressive that you are not afraid of this type of projects, I am glad that someone knows how to repair these car battery kits, I don't know if anyone in Poland or the EU deals with such topics at all.
jesus. it's like you are trying to outdo yourself in bad advice.  this is not your underpowered civilian car. this is a hyper-car. engine in P1 is already on the limit and hybrid system there is a sport hybrid, not the economy hybrid . it compensated for power low power at low rpm.  reality is you just realized you can't fix this car but you will try to find a fool push it to, and this is why you say things like that
I'm NEVER right on ANY of these channels and I don't own a fancy mclaren.  However, after taking one look at that fried mess and knowing that Rich was going to say that the battery was but ONE destroyed component out of 4 or 5, I'm proud to finally say after 1,000 views that my diagnosis matched perfectly with his. Internet -----999 Me ----------------1
A 21700 is like 5 bux depending how many u buy and those r way bigger.............
7:39 Reminds me of the inside of all of my flashlights.
the mechanical one part fuses like that can't fail. it's impossible like impossible to gravity to just stop working. water flooded the cells and created short before them.  they are for different stuff. for shorting the wire outside the battery for example
I totally get your frustration with the whole hybrid system. It is unnecessary, but at the same time it is such an important part of the P1. Not important in a practical way, more in a context of time thing.   I think the car will be great without, even faster, but it will be more impressive if the hybrid system works.
As a heads up, and this extends beyond the P1, the BMS broadcasts to the rest of the vehicle what the batteries current capability is based on its own internal model of the whole battery, one cell in the battery or a generic cell chemistry.  Other controllers don't request data from it, they see what it will allow at any given moment and they have to do their job taking into account what the battery is saying it can do.
Mclarens are a rip off
_'This is not me.'_  Your adverts are always the best. Yours and the Internet Historian's are the only adverts I watch.
Tavarish and this Mclaren build was truly a bold move , Stepping into help shows what makes Rich builds today’s top tech talent , that’s right , the triple T threat .
If you fit a fueltank where the hybrid battery used to live I am sure it will get a lot more extra range than 6 miles. :-)
i love ur product plugs best way to do it imo
It's not a rip off. It's a luxury component of a luxury brand of semi discontinued parts that they keep in dead inventory... a 15x markup isn't bad when you consider a leather purse might cost 100 bucks in labor and materials and sells for over 20k....
Not afraid of getting cancer from all the battery dust and burnt materials? 😮
Interesting, I guess it's why you see later gen cars like to split their drive train to '4wd' as it will be easier to manage electric and ice separately.  Edit: I guess there's no room for a motor for the front? I guess one still has to mess with the traction control etc linked to mclaren system if you do that. Which will be a pain.
The crazy thing is is this McLaren came from Naples Florida which is where I live and was born it came from a guy that lives on Gulf Shore Boulevard North on the beach
16:00 Make it a packet of Basmati rice and I might be slightly interested.
Freddie was speaking to I guy in Europe that was building batts for the P1 but I totally agree he should ditch the hybrid system he could use the space for turbos or a water to air intercooler or maybe enough room for both which would clear room from around the engine and also clear heat away as well so all round be better then you have the weight difference and the the carbon it would be the fastest McLaren straight out the box in my opinion anyways but I dnt imagine it would be far off the mark anyways
Awesome and outstanding always.Thanks for sharing and taking us along
I mentioned it on Tavarish' video as well but at least the cell-block design and battery interface module could very well be from Super B batteries (The Netherlands). I worked for them as an engineer. They also make starter batteries for Koenigsegg, Lotus and I think the Valkyrie (this ran while I was there). Can message/email you names of at least the lead engineer and owner (who is quite involved in motorsport and online).
Nicely explained. A vote here for hybrid delete - the car will never be original so why not
This is one of the best automotive collaboration
totally agree rich
Wow. $560,000 will get you a tree house in Canada. But Turdeau will own the tree and you'll be happy and like it.
yep K.I.S.S. ditch the battery
HAHA Rich i always knew thats where you lived i see all your cars parked outside the GB didnt know you owned the place
Rich is an extremely smart dude, just had to say it…
Not to be a smartass but when you are taking the battery apart, is any of the stuff that fell off or washed off bad for the environment like toxic? Just wondering with the whole climate fieasko if that is like the stuff that comes out the tail pipe of our Internal Combustion engines, ya know the P word stuff that's opposite of good for you, supposedly? Tank U Beairwe maouch Wove you wong time viewer Dan U Sun!
richy rich.... e-foduh
What would you put in place of the battery though?
I hear Jay Leno has a P1.
Agreed, ditch the hybrid. It's a total loss anyway so don't see any value in making the car whole again. It would also be a ton of work, time and programming to get it all working and even then, the car may never be happy with all the changes.
John's safety squint with the death wheel was on point. OSHA Approved! :)
Tavarish working in sandals, classic Dominican move😭
Have to agree with Rich. dump the hybrid, the P1 should never have had a hybrid, just low weight & maximum HP & maybe Tavarish can even add an extra fuel tank to actually get some decent distance between refills.
I was hoping for a drop...would have made great content...lol
Is it me or Rich looking jacked lately?
3:00 - The 5th tab "Stevon still at community service" ❤️
At the end you mentioned just rebuilding the car without the hybrid system.  I was wondering that same thing.  How tough would it be to eliminate that entire electric drive system and then convince the car's computer to not care about it?
Who would have guessed The Electrified Garage were the perfect people to call when you want to de-electrify you car.
i don't know if i must say this or not, but i kinda miss Stevon
when Rich said "John is a trained professional" that got me rolling in tears.....!!!!  Good job guys..!!!!
Dude for real, safety glasses
Eyepro...we don't need no stinking eyepro!
Best episode in while!
How will that tub ever be safe.  I've seen a lot of carbon fiber parts burn on race bikes, and the carbon fails quickly. Sometimes it looks good, but gets brittle...whatever thanks.
How will that tub ever be safe.  I've seen a lot of carbon fiber parts burn on race bikes, and the carbon fails quickly.
The jasmine rice got me… Navy Federal is cutting the check for the car now.😊
is it just me or do these batteries look like regular 40152 batteries?
Well at least we know McLaren isn’t going to Tesla Rich and Freddy on this build. 😂
Freddie really said lift with your back and not with your legs then continues you carry said 156,000 battery with flip flops
Ditch the hybrid, MORE BOOST.
I def understand going without the hybrid system, but i also understand Freddy wanting to figure out a hybrid system that works lol. Being able to say its better or at least as good as the original and he didnt cut corners, thats kinda Freddy's thing. And he has Leno and those McLaren shops helping him, so plenty of data to go over, not to mention i feel like a piggyback ECU and some value spoofing, maybe a software dev or someone wanting to jump on board, could not only solve it but possibly make it even better than the OG or the ICE alone. But id def understand him going either way, or finishing it with just the ICE and adding a hybrid system later once he finds a streamlined solution. Who knows, hes crazy and crafty enough to figure it out for sure.
OK! A second hand limey import,made in the Midlands... Not a great idea to go forward with that Bucket Of Shyte!
Speedtail, 720S, P1 and 720S in blue are the same car, in a Porsche way.
Love this
The P1 has a 3.8 liter engine the 720S has a 4 liter engine , without the hybrid systems torque fill to make up for turbo lag and peak power the P1 is just a 650S . Not even a 675 LT , and no where near a 720S .
After seeing freddies video infogured youd post this lolol
I laid down in my bed and said Aw that feels so good then I heard tavarish say it lmao 5:34
I hopes he decides to do the na route
Your product placement should be studied as an example of creative integration of multiple revenue streams 👍
i own a rental company and i actually have a wrecked mclaren for sale  located in new jersey crash ruined
Is that carbon tub being replaced? It had crazy amount of thermal stress from that battery, I bet it hurt the adhesive used in the carbon...
So he would basically need to completely re-engineer the hybrid system.... and pray that it's done correctly for his 1 car...... because if it messes up it could over-spin his motor and blow the entire thing to smithereens....... Yeah just do the delete.
😂😂😂😂
What kind of moron does heavy lifting and serious mechanical work wearing shower slides!
Will be able to buy them in bulk offline for much less cost at your volume.
Up and coming youtuber!?? 💀 Tavarish is def not that
You might be able to dump the firmware from the original battery, even if the chip is toasted.
500,000k you could've built 3 forklift engine car's better and sold them for double
How do we find someone with an McLaren F1 🤔
its for sure a washer or dryer, you can see the old knob. still says something like its either "washed up" or "dried out"
The can bus can be reverse engineered!
5:58 is that the new Boston dynamics prototype? 😂😂
FAQ  the p1 in general. You only get 6 miles to the charge. on a 150k batterie.... DA FAQ You could fit more 18650 in that area. Plus get hell of allot more range.
what is that airgun? that you clean the battery  with the white horn thing on it
Audi Burlington is literally the worst dealership of all time
Rich knows what he's doing when he actually does it.  He messes about too much otherwise.
Rich is my Right To Repair spirit animal.
I really want that bag of jasmine rice from Rich.
Who works on their car in a garage with flip flops on.  Same guy who would drop $150k on a British car sized iPhone, with generator, fried.  What a nightmare.  Free country brother,  have fun.
Hmm, I think he should look for a used battery.  ... even if he finds a used battery and Rich repacks it with new cells.  I mean it's a hybrid car.  When else are you going to put in the space?
I agree I think Tavarish should get rid of the hybrid system and go all motor with his P1
If I could just drive your e-tron into Mexico and register it here, I'd be interested in buying it
we miss stevon alot
This p1 battery really paves the way for sodium ion battery.. lol
McLarens are hot British garbage. The British can make a car fast but are elitist
Love those safety sandals, Tavarish.
"It's top heavy." -Tavares
F the car I want that rice!
I would have bought the E-Tron, but then they went and riced it out.... I'll be here all week
You don’t check fuses in the fuse holders especially in a damaged unit only way to truly check a fuse is out of it’s holder with no wires attached to it. You could get a back feed thru shorts in the battery pack. In a three phase circuit never check fuses in their holders you can and will get a back feed and a false reading.
Milwaukee Tool should make a battery for them?    (sarcasm)
pull out the ice engine. make it a full electric car, it will be one of a kind.
Thanks for the immediate sound of a high pitch rotary tool grinding on plastic. Unsubbed.
New luggage space :-)
P100s maybe? I mean, who knows what down the line health effects.  Or capture the water runoff.  Do I need to be the person that says this?
How much for that is300?
These supercar companies are complete rip-off I don't know where they think their stuff gets that much deserved price
Thaks for the walk trough at the end. Good job.
While I agree that Tavarish should ditch the hybrid system, I also agree with the person who said they want to see you build a better hybrid system than McLaren did.
So glad to see 👀 you Uncle Rich! Keep up the good work man can't wait until tell next week. Wish I could afford to purchase the electric car from you one day!
I like Rich. I deny myself any surfing to stalk this guy. I live in NH and I do not want to bother him. He'll figure out a way to deorbit a satellite onto my head. Ruin my whole day.
Look up the address Rich used for his home address at 1:15.
Easter egg - golden banana! 😂
I'm a McLaren p.... (Thing Bob) expert. I mean, I owned no mclaren's whatsoever ! I do however av an expert opinion having once seen a picture of one (in passing)  In a magazine where most of the pages we're stuck together. Now I Personally believe that makes me an expert in all things McLaren related as much as anybody. Including both you rich, and you tavarish ! My proof of this is I once seen a picture of one on YouTube.  Anyway let's get to the hard work,.... the fact that you found it on, a toilet and not literally in, a toilet, is a good omen. It means ...... it means there's a very slight possibility that it's not a total piece of s*** ! (However, unfortunately this does NOT mean we're out of the woods !)  I'm gonna av to go into a kind of Very strange and dark graphic to explain this.... av u ever been out and about... Happy smiling, Smelling the flowers🌷 having a good day.... And then BOOOOM !! BAD STOMACH !!! caught short. (Need to get home *NOW !!!)*  On a side note .... I almost once had to take a s*** in a Aldi car park cos of this exact thing ! .... Yes right there, in the car park, full of people .... Wives children the whole shebang. Oh hello 👋 don't mind me. Jus caught short... Oh by the way, don't suppose u av any toilet paper do you... No erm ok ...  recepts ? .... tissues .... used tissues ? ...Newspaper ... sandpaper ... STILL NO !!! WHAT THE HECK U BUY ??? .... ANYTHING USEFUL AT ALL ??? ..... "I gee u a fiver for dem socks !!!" Anyway back to the story. I ran to my car (This is where I contemplated the car park thing.)  Wrestled with my keys jumped in by car and by SOME TRULY ABSOLUTE MIRACLE 🙏Which I still do not understand to this  day (<---Seriously!) It's an absolute mystery to me that I made it home. And Driving too ! we won't mention my driving style. Jumped out the car tugging on the belt to my trousers. Had to do the whole thing with the keys at the front door, all the time dancing from one foot to the other whilst I'm doing it. Ran in the house, undoing my trousers (Luckily we have a downstairs loo.) Jumped for it ...BOOOOOM !!! explosive decompression. I swear to you on these words right now believe me or don't, there was plash that had hit the Pan with such force it had somehow bounced back up and gone up the walls ! Impossible your thinking right (The angles of a toilet bowl don't allow it) well I'm telling you ! (Some friggin how given enough force) they do ! Anyway, my point is that it was both, in the toilet, and outside the toilet, kinda similar to your situation.  (like I said. *(ME)* expert)  Just incase ur interested. Best I could figure, I'd suddenly developed some weird reaction to Pita bread. (You know the stuff they wrap baps in.) shame cause I used to enjoy a good Bap and kinda miss them a little bit, but unfortunately for now it's just  pipe dream as it doesn't agree with my stomach anymore. And I'm not brave enough to try again an see if I've got past it. If i ever decide to move house, i might decide to try baps again about an hour before it's time to leave.  Anyway back to my original point. my point is that I guess this makes me the for most expert on this whole situation. U see, you found your McLaren on a toilet. When Given the state of it, it actually belongs in a toilet. Though our situations may have been similar. It's obvious to an expert such as myself Looking at this for a even a moment that the situation is obviously the opposite way around. Unfortunately it's also obvious to an expert such as myself that you 2 are such mere amateurs that unfortunately i would not be able to work with you and maintain my usual high standards.  After realising this, I've decided to retract my current offer of help and indeed swap it for the middle of my 5 fingers. So if you do indeed get stuck whilst building this contraption please don't contact me as I simply cannot be bothered to help !  P.s, Aliens just landed in my back garden agaim just now so I av to go spray them wiv the hose pipe.   Good day.
huh...wonder where he'll jay met another P1 leno owner...
why didn't you just pour coca-cola over the batteries?  Because it eats all of that corrosion.
Rich i would like to see some more electric builds.
Golden Banana, huh? Seems about right.
Tesla sabotaged this video
Sorry I missed the premiere,  @carl. I hit like 500 times already
Who buys a hybrid mclaren with 1-6 miles of range? Christ almighty.
Calling Freddy "up and coming"... 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Nothing compares to watching 2 yoked Chinese guys lugging a battery into the bed of a smart car.
come for the cars, stay for the humour
Who’s the un-funny-but-thinks-he’s-funny camera guy? Brutal stuff sir.
Two sponsors in one video?! Absolutely savage
Very Cool, ditch the battery, add a Harbor Freight generator in the back, or is the space or weed storage
A p1 without a hybrid system would be mental
Rich, you are very fun to watch,,and learn with.
Amazing battery fire protection
This is the stuff!  Back to a fun and funny episode where we learn something.  Thank you.
I'll skip most youtubers sponsored ads if I think they're bs or that the person isn't using the product (Keeps all your sponsored yt dudes are losing their hair after years shilling your product), but I'll let Rich's ads run every time because he just sells them better than the usual scripted shite that comes with them. I even let Raid Shat Legends run and I hate mobile games.  Rich is the master when it comes to yt ads, accept no substitute.
Cause everyone drives a Mclaren this is a problem that calls for an emergency lol
Uncle Rich lives at DB's Golden Banana? Cool!
We need more gigawatts to the Flux Capacitor! Great video Uncle Rich, can't wait to see what you have next.
Joke about lifting with back. Proceeds to lift with back, freddie
Just a simple rechargeable product in your home has these cheap cells in them and sold to the consumer 1000% markup. Thanks for YouTube. Showing up corporates.
Rich finally admits electric cars are not worth it.
Well said Rich
Is the electric motor still good?
Smart move!
Whomever sold that salt dipped p1 to freddy for 575k is probably still laughing hysterically
I found a few sites with a123 batteries for 11$
CANBUS=Car Area Network BUS
Where are your safety glasses people?
thanks for the content!
12:54 “Company doesn’t exist anymore” 🤔 What does he mean by that???? 🧐
My favorite part about each of Rich's videos is looking at the tabs he has opened during the sponsor 😂
Hey Rich, I noticed the Electrified Garage shop in Ocala is next door to a middle school. I didn't think you were allowed that close to a middle school for another few years?
Tavares next time we’re proper shoes you could’ve drop that on your feet and it would’ve been over
Mowing a hurricane was coming who ever "left" this car was definitely banking on insurance totalling it
Think of how many ells you could recharge with that battery..
That e--tron GT is like a stripper I once dated.  Will be a ton of fun, and you just can't stop looking at her, but in the back of your mind, you'll always be wondering just how long it will be before you question choices you've made.
Is a car that does not even run after you "rebuilt" it really a car?
Why not raffle the Audi?
Paying five hundred thousand for that piece of junk is hilarious. I like that you did not mention the first mcclaren that other guy built lasted less than a hundred miles. And people think that guy is awesome? Are those the same illiterates who support donald Drumpf?
Is it still for sale?
Interesting that so many enjoy poorly built, poorly engineered toys which never actually function as a car should. A Chevy Cobalt that covers 200,000 miles reliably is far more impressive.
Can Rich rebuild Tavarish's toes if he drops that battery pack on his "steel toed" sandals?
Mclaren forums is a lot like Tesla forums. 😂
I understand ditching the hybrid system altogether is good for performance and may make more sense for the average person, but, it would no longer be the special car in history that it is.  It's like buying a Murcielago and swapping in a Huracan V10 because it's more efficient when in reality you just took out the most Lamborghini part of the last real Lamborghini.  Also, the ad revenue made from documenting the rebuild and improvement of the system is an advantage he has over the regular guy who would be assed out of that money with virtually no upside.
I would use 21700 battery Friday did find someone who builds p1 batteries  and made them better . I would talk to them .
If I don't see flip flops then I know rhe safety has been violated.
Safety First!   Tarvaish must wear proper footwear!    🙃
I agree with Rich. Get rid of the heavy battery and tune the engine.
No one at McClaren never imagined that someone/people would completely dissect their battery cell.
Lol he paid that much for a flooded p1 by the time the project is done 50k more buys one
Rich  you have Good Old Common Sense on this. Would he also save Weight on the Electric Motor and the Battery Cooling System too? He could use the Battery Tray for his Luggage! lol . Rich nice YouTube video. Plus one more Fan .
I'm looking forward to WatchJRgo's video of the E-tron after he buys it.
rich believes the hype and has to monetize to recoup - at least he has some fun and shares the pain
I am trying to get some jasmine rice
wheres stevon
You da man!
Wow,whata tipoff. So in theory, you could build a battery battery pack,with more power output and range ,for over $120k less then McClarens prehistoric original battery. Wow I'm with u,remove hybrid system all together ,its doing basically nothing. In the process,saving money and weight.
I just want the rice😂 enjoyed👍
you killed five OSHA inspectors
So glad to see these batteries are so GREEN and so easy to dismantle, separate, and recycle.       😅😅😅
I hope Freddie sees this too, and loses the battery for more cubic inches instead.
Friends don't let friends purchase cars that are powered by batteries.
Flip Flop Freddie, sketchy ass battery forklift.
You BOTH Provided us GREAT Videos - Thank You...
Where the fuck is stevon like come on. I know most of us would like an explanation to what’s going on and instead of the conspiracy theories in the comments. You have to make a video sooner or later and I’ve been watching rich builds since the sock babies lol
mclaren getting exposed for over priced battery 14:08 that’s crazy how much you can save
3:05 ZOOM IN AND READ THE TABS.
What is that air tool?
I thought the same thing from day one to just delete the hybrid system altogether…..
that notice to self at 0:58 si absolutely priceless :)) smart guy
It’s LiFePO4 pack which has a high output but low density. Headway might make a better cell then A123. This also why the car didn’t explode into a fireball as lithium-iron cells are less volatile then lithium-ion.  Something to get you the clicks might be to compare how explosive a lithium-ion vs lithium-iron burns when damaged.
50k is a bargain for that car, if I had the coin I’d buy it in an instant.
But a 765LT though ..
6:05  How many viewer thought (as I did), Freddy and Rich were going to toss that battery into the dumpster?  Not today....   That thing must have been a real handful, seeing how it squatted the back of the pickup.
The web browser titles in the SSAdvert providing a Stevon update is class 😂👍🏻
Nice Easter egg - The World Famous, Golden Banana
i mean you dont need your eyes, your foot, but you need your lung to stay alive......wear a mask pls!! gooosh
Oh dam you live north shore mass??? Nice.
17:56 coming from someone who does controls in automotive, this was a great simplified explanation and you are right, the hybrid system is not worth it what so ever
Bro Freddie got those lil sandals in sport mode moving that battery. 💪🦾
Will there be a video on the Arcimoto FUV that was shown in the video??????
Love your videos love your content your a genius man. Amazing work and your helpful and care for others. RR for life.
idk; the P1 is a hybrid because it's from a specific time, and I think if you're going to do a "better" P1 then it should still be hybrid. Spoofing canbus isn't rocket science, and while it would be hard to develop... there IS a market for replacing these batteries at some point and if it's going to be 150k from McLaren having a demonstrably better pack available for half the price it would definitely tempt some owners and you could recoup the costs of development with only a few sales. The Electrified Garage would be a perfect place to sell those too.
Nice.. I thought you were just some rich idiot car guy but it seems you proved me very wrong and you know your electronics stuff... good luck with this project!!
JUST PUT A HELLCAT ENGINE IN
You guys better save the charred circuit boards to rebuild them
Uncle Rich, you are too darn old to lift big batteries 😂
Now we know why Tvarish went to Jay Leno 😂😂
👍
You got it pretty much covered uncle rich
I don't give two fucks about cars, but I've been watching this channel for years now simply because Rich is so geniusly witty
If using Tesla battery, the hybrid motor also need to replace. Maybe using Toyota hybrid motor or VW one. That motor inside McLaren is no go. But the motor like Prius only produce 80hp. You can add 80hp just a little bit boost for engine.
Stevon selectively edited out of the video....such a shame
What happened to Stevo?
You guys could use headway heard is hit or miss but tenergy  cells are better, 123 is high-end ,they are way cheaper at 8$ then the 24$ cells 😮
nice cost/benefit analysis.  drop some weight and turn up the boost.
Risk man Rich is so damn intelligent
Lol family guy lifting reference 😂😂
Hurricane Ian.
I wonder what a P1 can bus smells like?...  Someone should go sniff one... ❤
"This [battery] is absolutely massive" tell that to my wife
Hey Rich. Have you looked at tge hybrid system in the new McLaren Artura? It supposedly has 11 miles range on the battery.   My favorite McLaren besides the F1 is the Senna because I'm a road course guy. I also like the 765LT.
Great analysis and great points, Rich. I totally agree. Do the delete. It's not like he's trying to do a complete restoration, rather, he's doing a ton of customization.
You should have used Freddie's hair to clean that battery.
It wouldn't be a P1 without the hybrid system I don't think it would be a good move plus you have to tune all that out of the ECU and all that stuff if it's even possible
Damn Rich! I didn't know you lived so close!
I knew this was coming after watching tavarish most recent p1 video.  You guys work well together!
Market Basket rice lol.  We have Market Basket in a lot of the East Texas small towns.
My McLaren expertise is an accumulation of everything I have learned in the last 24 minutes and 45 seconds.  That being said, it is safe to say the previous owner of this McLaren should be ecstatic with his insurance check.
these ugly cars should be crushed
Need right to repair and the car manual/spec
So, 10% off Audi with square space code? Did I hear it correctly? Ps. Rip Stevon
Nice Hawaiian safety shoes Tavarish is wearing when you guys are lifting the battery
156k for a battery thats rough
Just swap a Prius drivetrain in if you want to keep the hybrid.
I've been down these kinds of paths before, yeah, sure, it's possible, you can sniff the CAN bus, then program something to emulate the original battery pack, but yeah, cost vs. benefit, for a couple extra miles, it ain't worth it.
Why the hell is he wearing sandals trying to carry a battery
bro it has a built in nitro e boost button.  you think he wants it just sitting there
Big fan from, Love from Kashmir
If everyone doesnt know RIP Steven
Rich, the 'hybrid' battery in a super car is for low end torque.  Sorta like a Honda IMA hybrid.  It desnt do much to save gas but to free the engineers to design the ICE for top speed.
Is that the same dude who gave the Bricklin SV-1 to Derek Bieri from Vise Grip Garage?
1:42 "brattery" that's how I pronounced it when I was 5
You got refer burns on your shirt Rich
I’m with Tavarish in keeping the P1 a hybrid
Tesla needs to invest in Carbon Tubs :D
2:05 WRONG, it was UNDER WATER, thus the water saved the rest of the car from burning
(watching rich and friend crab walk battery) don't you have film crew to do that heavy lifting friend?
What was the air tool being used at about 6:47 in the video?
I love how you're lifting a giant battery and Freddy thinks slides are the proper footwear. Especially walking backwards. Rich goes for shoes but totally undone laces like slip ons.
Hit up @BatteryHookUp for batteries uncle Rich!!
You made a video just to ‘blacksplain’ things to us. Wth
This Tavarish guy may be in trouble..
Hope if the 2 of you keep working together there is alittle less overlap
If Uncle Rich says ditch the battery and electric motor, then you should ditch the whole hybrid system. The hybrid system didn’t contribute much to the performance of the car, it just made people feel good for having a hybrid system.
4:21 I backed the best horse in that fight: the Sega Saturn
Rich, you're right. You nailed it. Lose the hybrid.   Add n0s if you want.
I don’t know what Tavarish is eating, but he shouldn’t be.  Rich seems to have a better diet.
I’m a regular visitor on this channel. Whoever is watching this video, I hope this day will be a great day.
Well the electrical motor also acted as the starter so you would have to solve that issue.  The with no hybrid system communicating with the engine management might mean you have to switch to standalone engine controller for 30k.  It could work but could cost a similar 50k to make it work without the hybrid system.
Wow a 18x mark up ffs people are getting ripped off
I want to see his project through to be showcased on Top Gear with a lap...not sure if Mclaren will allow it but, the potential gains with the newer tech is endless.
Wow.  After watching this they probably would have been better off with a supercapacitor system that is charged by the engine and only used to help launch the car from 0 to 60...  At least it would have lasted longer... outside of all the water and hurricane damage...
I was curious about the "poverty spec tycan" as you called it. Would love to have seen other videos of it getting going again.
what? not gonna include a thing of BLACK ICE? 🤣   also, it looks like Alibaba has the A123 AHR32113 cells for about $10 a pop if not less
I hate getting ripped off buying batteries for my Mclarens too
the poor quality of McClarens I would not buy one even this one the connecting rods have to be replaced as they are undersize and fail, make big holes in the block, I stick to my Lamborghini's instead Rich can do better
“Next week “ … we heard that.
What about the batteries Freddie saw in europe?
i agree with Rich on this one, fuck the hybrid, save some weight, crank the boost and get rolling!
Buy this E-Tron for 50,000. Shows a video doing donuts in a parking lot. Yeah, that will sell.
You do realize that lithium is toxic? A burned battery without a particle filtration mask is a VERY bad idea.
I have been watching your Chanel for ever and didn't no you own that place in ocala Florida that is wear i live
These knuckle heads don't wear safety shoes ! Puma makes safety shoes RICH.
Freddie: 😑Safety squints engaged!
What is this? A crossover episode?
"The cheapest E-Tron in the world."  Hoovie has entered the chat
But… maybe a hybrid P1 can go VROOOOOOM-
Is it a rip off in todays money or ten years ago money? Everything with tech seems to drop in price quickly, especially over 10 years.
A123 high power orange cells. Probably LFP because case is aluminum about 15$ a piece. Good luck rescuing the bms and btms !
6:41 What is that nozzle?
I just sorted out a giant pile of wire of every possible gauge, turns out theres enough to wire a house, several vehicles, a small redneck factory. Hording materials is perfect for sudden onset and planned projects, and recycling even a mclaren can actually save alot of money, if you can redo a battery pack from recyclable or cheaply available core materials, in this material world where you either have things, or you have more of those.
Grinding without eye protection is just 👌🏽
Your right !400 pounds less 1000hp to wheels . That’s what he needs to do
Tavarish is built like the bodega store employee who makes a sandwich for himself every time he has to make one for a customer.
10:25 "New York city high-rise."  No, that's a Miami Florida apartment complex...  Oh, I'm sorry... is that too soon?  It's not even a joke, though.
He should LS swap the McLaren
Damn... cha boy tavarish getting up there
*I think you're right @Rich Rebuilds , @Tavarish should forget about replacing the battery, gut the hybrid system and shoehorn the biggest engine he can in the P1*
This is the same exact video tavarish just put out just more ads!!! Very disappointing.....
"A lot of clown fish poop." I'm not only surprised that he's able to recognize clown fish poop, I am stunned that you let him insult you that way and get away with it...  Clown Fish poop, YouTube poop... idk...
Old Newbury st.  So is that where u really met leenda?!?
The P1 community needs to reverse engineer the hybrid system before they all become obsolete and need to be repaired. But it's easier to remove it, save weight, invest in a better engine and turbos, and go just as fast. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂👍
Ali express $37 for 4
I’m surprised @WatchJRGo hasn’t bought that Etron yet 😂.
Don’t be a cell out uncle rich! 😅
SELL the parts, HotRod the Car do us all a favor and show McLaren who to electrify a P1 with used parts to beat the original I DARE YA
I miss stevon
My poor peanut has not recovered.
Isn't Jay Leno Freddie's bestie , do you suppose Jay having an identical P1 might give a shot at getting the cambus info
THIS IS NOT ME 😭😂😭🤣😭🤣😂😂😂😭
Where is Stevon?
you gonna get sued by McLaren bro...lol
You give me 2 bags of that rice and you got yourself a deal.
Did Stevon leave with Jimmy Hoffa?
Lol, only rich would call a channel with almost double his sub count, up and coming 😂   Love you rich!
Great video, Rich. Sad to see it can't stay original with all the work involved, but that doesn't mean it can't be made faster.  Just like the GM F40, mods can make a trashed supercar com back from the dead, and be faster.
Obvious solution is buy a wrecked plaid and tesla swap it.
I guarantee you nobody with a P1 is going to let you guys take it apart to read data off of it even though it would be beneficial to them later on down the road let's be real All these p1s are going to need a new battery in 5 to 10 years then they'll be upset when it's affecting them
You are a bad man sir. Keep it up
I love you Rich :)
Freddy is supposed to get the Hamilton Collections old battery that McLaren replaced.  Changing the cells on that batter would be ideal, as it’s rebuildable.
Y'all tuning up a brand new battery??? Hot rod p1
1:25 I’ve never heard someone summarize car YT this well in one sentence
So what would he do about the reverse. I believe the hybrid system is the only way the car goes into reverse
I’m just here for the rice
But instead he goes and visits Jay Leno to get info from his P1 😂
that air fart gun thing is the dumbest tool ever made it does nothing a regular air blowing tool cant do and im sure its more expensive.  again reason number 10 why i hate humans
I bet the newer batteries are pouch batteries
again -  👍 👍 🔧  Nice Job qoᒋ ǝɔᴉN Nice Job 👀❤🤍💙
Are those steel toe flip flops? 😂
3:05 top url names go wild
Sooo, Uncle Rich, are you gonna build one and test it in Freddy's car or nah 😅
I love the days you upload🎉 I know these videos take a long time to make but nonetheless you deliver every time and it’s always worth the wait. 💪💪
Djokovic won the US Open in straight sets which translates to 3:00 ❤️
Ok so how many Stevon comments are we going to have this time
It's a McLaren pee-pee 1.
Nice safety flip flops Freddy! 😂
Shout out to every intro script guy, & every dialog on this video  !’ & every videos on this channel
Turns out Freddie's buddy is Jay Leno.  Who knew?1
-  👍 👍 🔧  Nice Job qoᒋ ǝɔᴉN Nice Job 👀❤🤍💙
This video reminds me of those guys in India rebuilding 12l diesel engine on the dirt floor with hammers and flat head screw drivers in their flip flop. Pure gold good job fellas.
"This is not me"   Rich that's some funny stuff
Shipsta.....Squarespace!
Come on now, turn it into a McTesla !
Capitalism at its best...
I totally agree, Tavarish is building the motor to have considerable hp which in itself eliminates the need for that over complicated hybrid system. It might take away from the value substantially though so there is that to consider. If he plans on keeping the car long term, then forget the E system! 👍😎✌🗽
I'm an EE! (Watches video) I'm more of a digital guy...
Why Mclaren's $156,000 battery is a complete ripoff  It cost $156,000
Rich has some strange browser tabs open... 🧐 - as always.
OSHA approved!
I dont know if you noticed but McLaren cars are a complete rip off.  !
so, Tavarish was at Jay Leno's garage checking his P1 🤔 i guess he went to see stuff you just talked about. Jay is that P1 buddy
You’d think a lithium battery pack would be 110% waterproof because you can’t expose lithium to the humidity in the air. But, I guess some got in and FIIIIIIIREEEEE
I would leave out all that battery crap and just do an insane turbo engine. Light and fast and beautiful all carbon
What i really want to know is, what cells did they use, That the battery could go on fire and not raze the entire car to the ground?
i agree ditch the hybrid system and build the original engine and call it a day.
I can't believe you put your address right there on YouTube.
You know whats easier than hitting the like button…. That’s rght you guessed it, making a website on square space!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
2:37 Audi for sale I'll buy it $50K Canadian that's a deal
we go make some rice & peas meh boi
Good Call!!
Apparently, someone once said that the best part is no part. 😉
My man really said Ay-yo when lookin at that battery cell price
If I buy that Audi, I damn well better get my rice Rich. I'm _not_ buying it, but I wish whoever does an enjoyable meal. I enjoy watching Freddy rebuild this, but seeing this video I realize he wants it to be as close to stock as possible except that he wants it faster, stronger, and just over all better... I feel like those might be mutually exclusive goals now. Considering he's modifying some of the exterior and the engine itself I feel like the only thing stopping him is this battery, question is will the car run without it? How do you fill the battery shaped hole in the P1s battery shaped taint?
C rating is a myth.  Lol
2:36 !!!!!!
You know rich isnt a true trini because he isnt wearing sandles in florida.
Wow that's really complicated, you're really smart Rich. Tavarish picked the right guy for the job.
Ditch the hybrid. That was my thought when i saw the thumbnail.  Nice junkyard video though
So he dropped in to Jay Leno to get some canbus data? Makes sense.
I dont think he'll be able to just ditch the dated battery tech. The IPAS system runs on that battery which creates the low end torque and makes the car quicker off the line than later McLaren models. I remember Randy explaining that before he passed away.
Drop the dumb ass electric motor and batteries. Super weight reduction on a part that is pointless
Glad to see Rich and Freddie both taking safety and proper footwear seriously!
Electrified Garage is an exploit.  He doesn't believe in it.  He wanted to remove the Electric portion.  Poser x10
Watching them realize it's about 20k parts for 160k was worth every penny...🤣🤣🤣These companies are blatantly ripping off rich people, very evident.
Love that you all are down here in sunny Florida with me ❤
Nice video .very informative. It doesn't matter if he uses the batteries or not, you just saved a lot of money regardless of how it goes.
I mean if they were paying the workers of ALL auto industrie workers a living WAGE  I would get the scalping. Cars are just multi level marketing for the big three and OPEK
THATS IT IM SENDING YOU COCOBUTTER. 23:46
🤘😎🤘🇬🇧
Brattery 1:42
I want to see Rich build a better hybrid drive than McLaren did.
Very wise words at the end :)
Nice subtle shoutout... you dancing at the Banana?
This is NOT me is a subtle hint
A local electric car enthusiast @ElectricSuperCar has been sharing a lot of this information on his channel.  It would be really cool to see Rich help out on his latest project...
Hey Rich you should sponsor KEEPS because it obviously works for Tavarish😂
Inb4 “where is Stevon” comments
How the hell does a modern man do work in flip-flops?  Yes, this is aimed at you Tavarish. You're a pebble away from shattering your back.
you arguments are logic, but this is not about logic, for the price of the flooded  and wrecked p1,  tavarish could have bought 2 perfect 720s, a P1 with no hybrid system is basically a 720s with a bodykit..  so what is the point of rebuilding it?
if you,ve seen tavarishs video skip to 17:11
Did you post your own address on Youtube? 😳
Rich is the GOAT respect
It's amazing that you help these small up and coming YouTuber's, so humble!!
I agree with you Rich . Get rid of the hybrid system..
Might be easier to sell cars WITHOUT the donut vids. Doing donuts is not a good sign, ya know, like "previous owner is an elderly doctor" good type sign.
I'll bet Freddie would have made you a killer deal on that beautiful red Lexus out in front of his shop @6:!1
Dear Mr Rich RE-Build's  !! .............. That More Like It  ....A Superb Vlog !!  Nicely DONE !! ...........Bless You & You're Team
The car should never be road legal again after the battery fire. pooof value just went down 300k.
Audi is for sale (video shows the Audi getting beat in a parking lot) ,  yeah .... no thanks. What could possibly be wrong with a car owned by a youTube  dude?  Oh,  everything.
6:03 Rich walking like he bow legged
If McLaren didn't see this one coming...🤷🏽‍♂️ 😅
Fucknstefon just a woodworker
That's why I'm glad you are here. I can believe in making a profit. Could everyone who wants a 2 door get one priced right? He'll no sucker.
Love the deep dive!
Not one pair of safety glasses in sight 😂 50k for that etron is not shabby
Sounds like Freddy's got some decisionizing to do.
Any Rich Rebuilds fans know any of his videos that you'd call the most savage of all his videos? I need a savage video from him. Maybe he has not made the most savage video yet. Savage jokes, savage opinions, and physical savagery tearing apart a car.
Everyone not from eastern Massachusetts and southern NH, "What is Market Basket?"
Not seeing Lenda every episode is the ripoff!!!
World’s greatest electrician
Wtf happened to that poor IS in front of Tavarish's shop???
Needs to be converted to full EV running a Caddy gearbox and 8 e-motorcycle motors 😂
I knew you had side gigs, but The Golden Banana?
Great seeing Unc Rich with Freddy ❤
Uncle Rich to the rescue
18:05 what was that crazy sub-sonic horn air blaster attachment on the air hose?
Rich will be signing autographs tonight at the Golden Banana. Come see him and say hi.
Not having annoying entitled white rich kids makes this a great channel again
How hard would it be to turn that space into another gas tank?
The N64 versus PlayStation is funny as Nintendo got together with Sony and PlayStation was born, Nintendo failed to make a disc drive attachment function meant for the SNES so they partnered with Sony.
I love the 144 month finance comment. I swear probably half of the mclarens on the road are financed for 120 months or more. They are stealing the stereotypes from Lamborghini owners at record pace. I was just reading a thread on the mclaren forum the other day where people were talking about how they were taking out HELOCs to buy their cars with
1mill, 150k, 10k... these numbers are to big for me. If it was a $10 rc car I found in a toilet and it needed a $1 battery, I would just throw the damn thing away.
Don't agree with the ditch the hybrid system, the punch from the electric makes a difference here...the engine isn't that special which is why it's going to be rebuilt with stronger parts. Could prob upgrade the hybrid system a bit during this process.
Good stuff.  Thanks for the explanation.  Tavarish should get the car running and add the hybrid mess later.
What tf is Rich wearing on his feet?? 😩😂 2010's skater ass shoes
They all look the same... I can't tell the diffrence between any Mclarens...  not a fan... the insides look like a bad 1980's auto...  the infotainment system is disgusting... and the car is just a rich guys "look at me" small penis alert

Y’all should get a magid eyewear sponsor and use some eye pro
The rice is a dealbreaker!!!!
Did you get a new camera Rich? The quality of this video is really good and cinematic
We miss you Stevon!!
Love the channel Rich. Budding EV Conversion blogger here in the UK, check out my builds and mission! 🔌🔋🏁
I saw Stevon in the ricer getting it serviced. Nice Easter 🍳
"The hill they'll die on" 😂😂😂

What is that amazing hand held fart machine?
Lifting the battery with flip flops, you are a legend Freddy
STEVON SIGHTING
Tavarsih in his fuxkin SANDALS! LOOL.
My guess on why steevon can’t be in the videos again because he most likely is getting/got charged with reckless driving and him showing up in the videos will negatively affect his court case
Wait haven’t I seen this already?… jk, your version is funnier and more entertaining than tavarish’s 😂😂😂
Can u be my dad
So awesome to see yall rip that battery apart
You are a very good Youtuber.
Hi:):)
Tavarsh sent me
That's a hefty price for a battery, must be made by Dewalt or Milawaukee.. LOL
While watching Tavarish P1 rebuild series, I almost scream to the screen, when will he wash the car with fresh water? To remove the most salt and dirt possible, instead of ice blasting, as if he was already in a detailing fase.
When you buy a Mclaren your just buying the power train and wheels....everything else is free !!!
I also share Rich opinion about the P1 rebuild. Fred should build up the engine with stronger internal parts as bigger turbos, and drop the hybrid system. It could actually increase over time it value, than just a salvaged P1, with a pimp my ride rebuild.
Blud is going from Rich Rebuilds to Poor Rebuilds 💀
This is gonna be interesting. Have you ever thought about building powerbanks for womens sex toys? Upgrade their toys easily with a McLaren battery. You would be rich!!
thank you sir i will defs consider this with the mclaren i defs own
Thanks, I will reconsider now when I decide to buy a Mclaren
We need more people like you explaining these things ❤
