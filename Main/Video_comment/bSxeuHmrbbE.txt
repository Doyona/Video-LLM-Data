Ask my robot even
Yk my brother was once held captive on his bday
🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🥷🥷
its insane in how many of his lyrics he said he cant put his guns down and he fell into that same trap tried to beat some1 ass
He driving a hellcat u here it is
You hear about my brother shooting up out his sleep saying AH  my bum talking about Jaydin doing it again
Im tracking them at wallburgwsy
Dark web wise
They lost they crew tonight to as well 😅
For an example my brother a well known dark web victim
They say the wars  gonna go down about tayk47 2055 and some other people they didn’t name
It’s what a boss dose is call people out in music
Like those real comments 😅
The rest remain truth
About that stolen gun buy out
Mind me I’m hoaxing
Ghg including we are pretty close
Just for  her to try and altercate wit the best moon buddies
In 100 Khalil bricks wit All our memories with the handsome
They’ll be hearing from dead people
I call Sonja out on her shit talking about Carlos put the guns down I was like what else. Is there I can do but clap back can try my Margwa suit and let em yk
I call Sonja out on her shit talking about Carlos put the guns down I was like what else. Is there I can do but clap back
We just bug alot
Can I pay wit bullets residue test teleport drone
As in king protected what the handsome meaning is
As we all know what’s on that mind after hearing my song 100 Khalil’s
Be like I’m not hearing great news from Khalil tube
We just waiting for gas or call 911 and tell em that yk Every one can hear
Then pull up to Nanaimo and be like please don’t take the handsome from  us as we would love to visit and show him love means closeness
You’d shed a tear I rap about my brothers life style he lived yk Khalil Calvin Isiah Matthew
You check my song 100 Khalil’s

This piece of shit jumped me with a bunch of his friends back in 2018. I'm a 5"1 girl. He jumped me with 5-6 of his friends. Thank God there was a group of older guys close enough to hear me screaming for help. They came to my rescue and chased them off. One of them took off with my purse, but one of the guys who came to my rescue chased them down and brought it back. They jumped me at an elementary school in DT T.O. at around 9:45 p.m. They tricked me into following one of them into the schoolyard and when I turned the corner, there were 5-6 of them waiting for me. It cost me HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS in bribes to find out who it was that jumped me. One thing I can say is thank you.. you inspired me to learn how to protect myself. May God help you if I ever see you in public.
king von care
"No adrenaline I just running shit."
100 Bricks RAP SONG IS A SOUND GOOD RAP SONG THAT IS BY Lil Berete.
When von said he turn his opps into fans I think about fbg butta
We're here for Von ❤
Kanye West is the greatest musical artist in Hip-Hop to ever come out of Chicago. King Von is the greatest rapper to ever come out of the Raq!

Y'all run it up 4million million views 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
I’m a 45 year old woman with a 24 year old daughter. I’ve listened to pretty much only, what some call “gangster rap”, since I was 14 years old and my daughter is the same. She doesn’t understand what was lost when Von passed. In 30 years worth of rappers, Pac was my generation, Von is my #2 greatest of all time. This song showcases his genius on a different level than his others!!! The talent in hip hop now is very sad, imo. We lost one of the all time best!!!  #LLKINGVON
Thank you for this clip Berete. That was from the day he passed 😢
Rest in Paradise  Von will always be king RIP Grandson
special
He was sitting on this video plotting 😅. Hope to see more from the young brotha
I miss Von so much

von killed that text again
Hes a strong Rapper, he can hang  with Von ! But Vons voice tells a Story when he raps! He was a Badass !
King von was a criminal a murdered a thief and a womanizer who rapped and made millions off of the terrible things he did and y’all sit and respect him and worship him y’all dumb man why not worship and respect a bricklayer or a police man someone who actually does something good for society instead of worsening it and influencing young kids too do the same
someone make a versions with only vons line man sings his rnb shit for too long just give me von you can shut up
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭

Von reminded me of PAC in so many ways the way you can feel the pain in his lyrics the real shit they rapped about work ethic in the studio   leadership skills von dropping s lot of unreleased music after his death the way they was killed was even similar....i can connect with von more I'm from Chicago I'm BD! We from the same area and my family lived in parkway for yrs....all the shit he rapped about i lived it saw it or did it! Rip the real king 👑 Devon Bennett

Big cap in the dsp
Von is lyrically better then durk! He was like biggie, a story teller. he really put 100% of his life in his raps! that’s what make rap so dangerous and why many have a high probability of being killed. The trenches will always overtake rap. it’s their story, Their life, and that’s how Von and his opps lived. Therefore enough of America like their music, their life, their message! it’s a reality for hundreds of millions of ppl across the globe! you CAN BE A MILLIONAIRE over night in hip-hop/rap these days in 2022! Get 💵💵💵

_What’s sad is the beginning of this song we get what Von was really doing. This was his last night on earth🤧Von DIDNT look sleepy to me, he was rapping the lyrics to this song w/his blue & white scarf around him from his last location. Von & his entire team was back doored What did PAC true friends say Their head of security said no guns but☝🏽of PAC’s security said nah, I’m taking mine the only problem was he wasn’t in PAC’s car_ _Von crew was told they couldn’t take guns yet 2 security guards said nah, I’m taking my gun & HE Transitioned out of this life_ #Slutty🕊#SoundsFamiliar  #WeStill💙KingVon

LLKV😔
Your searching for satisfaction, peace and acceptance but it is never lasting because these desires must be based on truth.  Please read: [WAY OF HOPE & PEACE  John 3:16 For God so loved the world (all people), that he gave his only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believes in him should not perish (condemned to hell), but have everlasting life.  John 3:36 He that believes on the Son (Jesus Christ) has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.  John 14:6 Jesus said to him (us), I am the way, the truth, and the life (eternal life):  no man comes to the Father, but by me.  Eph. 2:8-9 For by Grace (from God) are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Eph. 1:13 In whom (Jesus) you also trusted, after that you heard the Word of truth, the gospel (I Cor. 15:1-4) of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,  Rom. 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Rom. 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:]
Same as all the other recycled rappers. Nothing intersting going on here.👎👎👎

Why do people lift up these artists?  They're doing and selling drugs, they're using mock guns with their fingers and hands, and there berating and wanting to hurt (murder) their fellow African Americans, or anyone that disagrees with them.  But it makes it okay, because they're putting their cruel life works to song.
Okay haven't started watching.  I'll edit my post when I hear the first N -word.   Edit:    0:32  There you are!
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing ✝️
Lil Snupe and king von were this generation's Tupac and Biggie long live them both✊🏿
Von will forever be the goat of the trenches.  Brodie went crazy thooo on me!!!!🤙🤞
I dont think vons fans know this dropped
can’t wait till we can say we smokin timmy LLKV

It hurts when I hear von say he not gonna die or get shot
Long live Vroy 💜 for real
Been waiting for this for over a year but good wait on the release for respect for von 💯
Von always rap about how no one would catch him slipping...
@ 2:21 The irony
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                         /., /., /., /. ,./ ,./ ,./, , , , , , ,,

Matthew 18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  Luke 4:41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.  Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  Matthew 17:18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
Damn I miss my boy 💔 rest up V Roy

Long Live Von✨GbG
Von pack
may allah have mercy on his soul
Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
Was this pre released ? I heard this months ago, jammed it forgot about it and now can't for the life of me find the original audio I had saved in my playlist.
Let me guess, another shltty trap song? FFS could we *_please_* close the book on this shltty fad-genre of rap, and get back to making music?

OMG IM SO HAPPY THIS DROPPED LLVON THIS FIREEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is time to get right with Jesus. You aren’t going to automatically enter into heaven if you have lied or stolen or had premarital sex. Even one of those makes you worthy of hell fire.  Don’t deceive yourself! The punishment of sin is hell fire.  Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of a future sin when we confess it. When you start to follow him you have to strive to obey what he commands.  No one will enter heaven without the blood of Jesus over you. No other way but through Jesus!.!.!.!

“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” Acts 2:38-39 KJV   “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” John 14:6 KJV   “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 KJV   “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” Matthew 6:14-15 KJV  “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” Luke 11:9-13 KJV  “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” John 6:35-40 KJV    “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.” Matthew 10:28-31 KJV    “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.” Matthew 10:32-33 KJV   “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10:9-13 KJV   “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” John 3:5-6 KJV  “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.” Colossians 1:13-20 KJV   “Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”  2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV   “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Matthew 6:1-21 KJV   “But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.” John 20:24-31 KJV

''We should never allow bitterness and disappointment to stop us from loving God and other people, The Lord uses the hardship in our lives to help us become better human beings so we can love more deeply and profoundly. The saddest thing we can ever do is to allow those who have harmed us to turn us into exactly what we’ve hated about them''  I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you)  we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite  the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit.  Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
