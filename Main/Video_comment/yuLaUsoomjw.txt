Rip Diogo Jota
I love you, Diogo Jota
Rest in peace Diogo Jota ❤ YNWA
Diogo jotani koʻrish uchun qayta koʻrayotgan men😢😢😢😢
His name is Diogo.
Jota giving it to the Leicester city fans is one of my favourite memories of Diogo’s, may you rest in peace amigo
We will never forget you Diogo❤️Forever No.20, Forever a champion❤️YNWA
Jota ❤😢 We will never forget you
Will always remember this game when Diogo turned it completely around with his presence 💔
That penalty, and those celebrations (not shown in this actual clip, for some reason) in front of Leicester's scumbag fans, cemented Jota as an LFC hero in the eyes of many. Including me. May he and his dear brother rest in peace.
R.I.P. Diogo. I always remembered his reaction after slotting the winning penalty. Away end with their poverty chanting throughout the night. Diogo let them know it's not on. He had the fans' backs. YNWA
Lovely Jota! R.I.P. YNWA! :(
Rip 😢jota
RIP JOTA I WAS THERE THAT GAME AND YOU CAME ON AND WON US THE GAME WHAT A NIGHT RIP YNWA❤️

Came here to watch minamino goal.. Good bye taki.. Ynwa
We will miss you Taki
Good few saves from kellaher
I’m writing this on the day Liverpool confirmed the sale of Taki to Monaco for 15mil. I’ve never cheered for a squad player as hard as I did Taki. He has a soft spot in my heart and I believe that’s also the case for many other fans. It is sad that a player of his talent has to struggle with playing time in a squad that is so stacked and literally the best team in the world. I hope Taki realises how legendary and important he was to Liverpool and that historic quadruple run. He delivered when called upon and never complained. Text book squad player and pure professional. I’ll miss you Taki, we all will. Monaco don’t just have a good player but a decent human being too. So long my Red Samurai
The speaker definitely doesn't support any of the two teams
No lie it sorta looks like Chelsea vs Liverpool
please please please let Taki start for the first XI
Liverpool FC 2022 FA cup winners. YNWA

Liverpool hey hey hey you never walk alone ⚽⚽⚽🤣🤣🤣
Liverpool are very good 👍
We're into the final now
Minamino scored a similar banger a while back.
The liverpool signings are underrated like minamino jota or kelleher the only the thing they have to improve on is their shooting

Diogo is best Liverpool FC is the best ⚽⚽⚽
Good game
Congratulations Liverpool FC 🥳
minamino is way too underrated
brilliant!
Let’s gooooo. I am so happpy
As a reds fan I suggest that we sell Salah and Mane this two have been very careless at the front of goal and the reason why we’re sitting behind city the number of opportunities they miss out numbers the goals they score  Bring in Mbape and Halland
Salah un mauvais joueur a fini notre espoir de gagner
haha Lost 1-0 vs us told all of you to brace for impact
Now where the highlight on PL against leicester ?!!!
That Guy called Daka needs to signed to Liverpool such a talented player licester City had gotten
Ruwheer
Both team play fast in the first half, but no one get booked. Hope tonight too they didn't get booked in first half
YNWA
Just remember one of your guys broke someone leg and he wasn't even given a red card
Jotta always saving us
No club in the world has the power like Liverpool to turn things around !! Talk about lifting the roof !!
What amazing game
So this is the team we drew 2-2
if the deficit is just a goal or liver only need a goal to win, I will always wait until the reff blow the last whistle...
Damn Who that guy score 3 times from Leicester not bad man so gg
Leicester defender is comedian
masalah liverpool tetap kiper
Jota is really good, he is the future of Liverpool and Portugal.
Life ❤️  Love ❤️ Liverpool ❤️
People wanted a cup run and that’s what we are getting
As an Asian, i'm happy to see Minamino scoring
We love you Leicester we do
LC is better than Manchester United.
Firmino so fanny
Amazing goals from Liverpool

You gotta love liverpool.
Ohhh my God this match was such a Wonder
The second best after man united
muhamet salaha türkiyeden selamalar
Minamino sold himself so cheaply. He can't complain that he's been kept for non-league games... He's just being paraded for a profitable sale.
Support your local authors. Born to be king The seeds are sown by local homeless Liverpool fan Philip j Lewis. Ynwa
When i saw the line up I hesitated to watch and until I summoned courage to watch we were 2-0 so I skipped:( , now I regret it..
Liverpool willndo fine with Minamino-Firmino-Jota as strikers for  a month. More important is having Virg and Hendo healthy.
미나미노 제발 잘되라, 동양인의 미들이 너뿐이 희망이 없가
I'm a saints fan and minamino was there I wish he done that for us I'm anoied
Egyptian king. Lord Origi. Now we have the Shogun Minamino. Guess Mane need a nickname

What a strike from Chamberlin
the best goals don't need replays :)
Schmeichel should have received a yellow card after the first taunting, and a red card if he did his dumb act again.
Good
when played this match? Where is M.Salah?
Liverpool never lost
Minamino sabaroged the penalty spot himself and missed when I saw him do that I was🤣😂

Jota, ox, taki is fantastic players
I just wonder the secret of the Anfield how it's hard to beat Liverpool on this ground
u still need a fend mid ..keta always slow motion...........
Jota is an enigma. He didn’t arrive with a fanfare, and I haven’t got “used to him yet” wearing a Liverpool shirt. However, he now as important to us as any other player in the team.
Yeah
i'm sure i cold hear Carra scream YESSSSS when Taki scored
THIS IS HOW MINAMINO DO THE DRAMA
Why is this stream like a fifa game?
えっ？!PKははずしたの？!

Vardy is still absolute beast from his debut season
Liverpul LİVERPOOL
from JAPAN. do you think Taki Minamino?
Rumours saying that Leicester players still deciding whos gonna take the next throw ins and Schmeichel should count till 100 before taking his next goal kicks
Minamino >>>>> Son
Hillsborough was funny 😄
MINAMINOOOOOO🔥
I so want Mini to do well at LFC. Caoimhin Kelleher has a massive future ahead of him. So impressed.
God save the king
Firminho... !!
Why did Salah mane van djik Trent Robbo and hendo not play??
南野はとてもすごかった。 リヴァプールに来てくれてありがとう 日本人ありがとう

watching this so many times but still nervous for the pen
If there was no Minamino, Liverpool might lost against LC
Goodbye MO Salah. Digo Jota is 100 times better than you.

I live  in leicester  and city was very  unlucky  against liverpool any other team than liveroool  city would have won liverpool for the cup
I'm just super proud of this team. I sincerely thought we were going to get beat when I saw the match day lineup. The mentality of the entire squad is something to study...

南野はやはり最高
EPL Lucky beneficiary of Germany & SPAIN doing injustice to these Best Quality Coaches Guardiola and Klopp.. Both are pure football without cheating or REFF connections.. SPAIN/Madrid REFFS especially cheated, robbed Guardiola Barca Messi to help MadREFF PENALD0.. Result is, as SPAIN Undermined Barva MESSI so did it bring down SPAIN National football quality..

Arsenal next and then Spurs or Chelsea.
Liverpool went nope

Wow Kelleher Guessed right 4 out of 6 shots.(2 shot was screamer and impossible to take)
No Salah No Mane, Why? Is it like they can't feature any of their first team player in this cup?
bunlara bak bide bizim superlige bak
miracle of anfield
Koumetio keep him on the bench, and dont give this nonsense that he is young. He is playing football isnt, that guy was awfull

Amazing Liverpool! That's why it's in the heart!
Tottenham Hotspur winning the title this year 🙄🇮🇳
What a game, it seemed over by the 15th minute but the young lads played extremely well against a full side Leicester♥️

Hate to said this but Kelleher deserve 11 starting in other clubs, maybe Championship or Else.. he deserve as 1st GK in Club or Maybe Future GK for US (LFC)
left-footed players determined the fate of the match :)
南野拓実っ！！！！！！🇯🇵
trận đấu đầy cảm xúc 🥰
Noone noticed admin has used the PL logo instead of the Carabao Cup logo in the score bug 😂
We fight for everything on the second half and got the goals needed. Outstanding performance by goalkeeper to save those penalties.

1:23 Santa doesn't even flinch for any of the penalties despite them all being such high pressure kicks. I guess he has more on his mind atm with his busy schedule in the next couple days.

Leicester: bout to to win in Anfield  Klopp brings in Jota, Naby and Ibou: I call this, a pro-gamer move. 😂
😆😆😆😆😆
That boy Billy needs to go out on loan. The defending on Vardy's second goal was awful. Matter of fact, he didn't even tried to stop the cross into Vardy.
Unlucky Leicester. Better luck next year.... 🤣
This just remember us to Istanbul 2005
I love you Liverpool and so much ❤️
Comon lads! Here we go!
Wow What a chest trap
An assist and a goal from Minamino, hopefully there is more to come from him.
What a match 👌
南野PK外してて草
The first goal Vardy scored was similar to the one we conceded over the weekend at Spurs   We need to do more to prevent such goals going forward.
So funny how maddison and vardy both celebrated in front of the kop only for Jota to score the winning pen and celebrate right in front of the away end
TSIMIKAS 🔥
Absolutely love jotas fire n passions that he has! Go on jota n give it to the foxes!!!!
minamino〜！
This is why we need squad rotation - it’s a bit too much for the players to play so often, even mentally it can be difficult

Vivemos dias difíceis. Mas em Cristo há Esperança e redenção. Como nos dias de Noé, como Sodoma e Gomorra. Assim estará a humanidade na proximidade da volta de Cristo. Imoralidades, guerras, doenças, fomes.(Mt 24). Alguma semelhança com o tempo presente ? Pois é. Precisamos buscar a Jesus, Caminho, Verdade e Vida. É tempo de arrependimento e de praticar as leis de Deus. O Rei está voltando. Ore. Leia sempre a bíblia. Deus console e socorra os sofridos com seu amor e poder.  Sua vida é preciosa para Deus. Saudações. 🙋🌺🌹🌷🌹🌷

People From All Walks of Life Praise the Competition for Exposing the CCP’s Brutalities Through Artistic Creation  Huang Kuo-chang, member of the Legislative Yuan, said every work shows concern for human rights. It is the greatest protest against the communist regime’s totalitarian rule.  Huang Kuo-chang, a member of the Legislative Yuan, said he heard about organ harvesting ten years ago. He said that every work shows concern for human rights, and is the greatest protest against the communist regime’s totalitarian rule.  “Frankly speaking, I was very, very astonished.

One cannot imagine this continues to take place in the 21st Century,” he said.  He said that all of the perpetrators should be exposed, and he believes justice will prevail. “I believe more and more people will stand up against it bravely,” he said.
They really need to give Minamino more playing time.
We didn't sign Werner but got Jota instead. For fucksake......       We dodged a bullet there. 😏
This is my favorite type of highlight, goes right straight to the goals!!! NBCSN takes notes!!
Leicester played their first team btw, props to our youngsters and rotating substitutes for stepping it up and playing so well. Minamino and Kelleher killed it, but don't take anything away from Keita, created so many chances and kept the pressure on Leicester the whole game.
Gomez, mate...

Japanese kamikaze made us happy and sad in this match . The red fire won the blue water . Liverpool fan from oman since  1994/1995 season (= 27 years)  . YNWA , the red heart always beats inside us .
The crowd made some noise throughout the game. Really amazing
Sucks for the foxes..... They fully deserved this!!
0:45🔥👍
Chamberlain is becoming a force. He's got that Stevie power shot. I love how there was no celebration when he scored just a "we got work to do" run back to center
Maldini's speech was really meant here.....we are not just a quality players but also has the mentality
But united united are winning the FA Cup
I think Liverpool will win the Carabao cup
So beautiful 😍
Where's salah?

❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

What a rubbish commentator indeed!
Let's not forget Konate's performance! As acknowledged by his team mates 2:40 😂
Yo, See me when Minamino Equalized!!! I went Nuts front of TV
Best team in the world right now, great game Leicester
o firmino e muito bom em qual quer posição kkkk.klopp joga na zaga ele ok.e muito bom ter um jogador completo no time.pra min ele e um dos 3 mais importantes jogadores do liverpool

I LOVE LIVERPOOL
Where is musalah i dont like without Salah 👊
People who understand goalkeeping know that Kelleher is bad. League 1/2 at best.
Great substitution
南野！！！^_^
Why do the best carabao cup games include Liverpool  Liverpool 5 - Arsenal 5    Liverpool win on penalties 5-4 (30 Oct 2019) Liverpool 3 - Leicester 3  Liverpool win on penalties 5-4 again (22 Dec 2021)

We are Liverpool and we Never walk alone

Well done you can have boxing day off.
Milners pass for Minamino to score the third is one for him to be proud of. Dreadful defending for the first two Liverpool conceded.

A brilliant Christmas gift to us Liverpool fans ❤️❤️🎄
Anfield won this game for liverpool❤
Vardy always brilliant
How many times this club was having this kind of thrilling games and still won in the end...so amazing
Klopp smiled after the second goal concede, he knows whats coming, an amazing comeback night XD
minamino has a very big potential but somehow still lacks physicality. his positioning, his vision, his control, everything is good up until some defenders bigger than him come knocking and he'd be on the floor shortly. hope he'll improve soon
I wanna see more from minamino !!! Especially during the AFCON
南野PK外すなや
padu minamino
Just goes to show Liverpool have such a strong squad,without spending billions on it like sheik city team,got great young players who never let Liverpool down always give there all,Leicester had best team out as well,best Milan to,
what a game congrats liverpool from arsenal fans, jota its class player also milner,ox,minamino.
Without Mohamed Salah, the match was difficult
Taki minamino vamooooooo!!!!!!!
おー
I would have loved to see Divock Origi playing this match had he been fit
Yes liv
What a spirit!
I have seen the world and I have never seen an exciting football club as Liverpool

Fantastik team "Liverpool"
Should have shown the full move Kostas did on the first goal. That dribble was saucy!!
Ignotr
Где Салах
Remember 2007 🤣😅🤣🤣
Amazing
Why Klopp gave stupid goalkeeper like Kelleher became starting eleven. Useless goalkeeper
南野！！！！
What will probably never happen but could be perfect solution : Vardy in Manchester United and Kane in Dortmund !!!!!
Best club ever IM BEST LIVERPOOL FAN FROM POLAND TAKE CARE ONLY THE REDS
ยอดเยี่ยม
Firmino will be first line-up or always will be subs? 🤔
So sad!
A Merry Christmas
Ели ливерка выйграла 😂🤣😂🤣
3-0 or 3-1 means liverpool will come with a surprising come back !
Awesome game.
Every game is a championship game for Liverpool fan and the way they play!
Wkwkwkwk
A Carabao Cup classic
Would've loved to see Minamino to finish with the penalty but all is well if it ends well.

Красавцы, обожаю
Nice match  And amazing goal for maddison Jota nice perform
Minamino was great great played. he has special something
Kto tu z Polski kibicuje Liverpoolowi?
Pięknie Liverpool!
In order not to be starting eleven at Liverpool anymore I think Firmino and Ox should move on to other clubs.
Yaaa!..Ye...Hay.....
Well doen lads 👏👏👏 our defence was 💩gomez not the player he used to be
Mo Salah ? Mo who ??????
We Are Liverpool NEVER WRITE US OFF!!!!
KAZI SAFI SANA FROM KENYA SALUTE!!

Weldone lads you need to win this cup and the  FA cup to build Liverpool's history of winning all cups like the good old days. Once again  Weldone wish you all a merry xmas, happy holidays at LFC
What a TEAM‼️
Leicester's travelling fans were awful, singing horrible songs.  So Jota celebrating the penalty in front of  them was utterly satisfying.
❤️ YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE 💚 😌🤐
Morton and Jota should have been sent off. The ref was terrible.
Comeback made only for FCLIVERPOOL 🔥🔥
*ÖZET ÇOK GÜZEL OLMUŞ..#*
*İYİ MAÇTI..#*
*LEICESTER SON DAKİKADA YIKILDI..#*
*LİVERPOOL ZORU BAŞARDI..#*
Loved the reaction of Kelleher for Jota’s pen. Doesn’t lose focus until it was in, the celebrations say it all
Use me as a Kelleher appreciation button
Reds♥️✌️
#1 trending in Thailand 👏
What A first touch from Minamino
I want this team to win EFL cup, FA Cup, league title, Champions League, Community Shield, Uefa Super Cup n Club world Cup 🏆⚽
Minamino : Created 1 goal, Scored 1 goal and missed a penalty..........but still the main Liverpool player that rescued Liverpool to the final !
I wish I liked Leicester but they are like Everton , if the disappeared no one would remember them
Simplemente espectacular!!liga inglesa: lejos, lejos..la mejor del mundo..siempre grandes partidos,jugadores profesionales,no hacen tiempo,no simulan,no protestan...la esencia del fútbol..gracias!!
Goodjob Taki 🔥
In football nothing is impossible until final whistle
Za
what i like about liver players is that they don't think a lot just with little space they directly shoot the ball to score the goals.
The best upset of Liverpool this time !!!! We are moving forward strongly !!!!😉
I love the strong character with which they played in this match. We're an ace in remontada 😁🔥. YNWA 🔥
আল্লাহ আকবার আল্লাহু আকবার আল্লাহু আকবার
liverFOOL AS ALWAYS
TAKI!🇯🇵 GOAL😆PK😓
Klopps kids against a full first team Leicester side now that’s class,👍👍
Leicester 😭😭
When we were 3-1 down, I looked at other live streams and saw so many hate comments about Liverpool, one in particular annoyed me, "Liverpool will lose 7-2 like last time." I honestly hated these comments so much because people obviously don't know Liverpool and I believed they could do it. I never lost faith in them despite the scoreline. And the fact that Leicester had their strongest line-up, compared to our Covid-hit list, we played extremely well in the second half, not as good as the first half. We conceded two easy goals in the space of 4 minutes, but that's okay, because we will come back stronger when we have other players back, such as Salah, Mane, Robbo, VVD, and many others. My message would be never judge a result until full-time because the first half is just the beginning, not the end. - YNWA.
James Milner.....Mr Reliable....wat a player..... Liverpool vs Dortmund U.E.L ..Liverpool trailing on away goal..90+1 Milner crosses and lovren scores...Liverpool through to the final  Leicester vs Liverpool...Liverpool trailing 90+4 Milner crosses and Minamino scores...Liverpool through to the cup semis...  The song shud be pass the ball to millie and he'll assist...
Lock score !
Мой любимый клуб!! Россия с Ливерпулем!!!!
Nice job
This Liverpool team always doing the incredible. If not smashing Records getting best of Opponents 🔥
よぬとひ
Liverpool 😍🔥😎
Liverpool goal keeper simple the best !!!
Too good and keeping it together to the very last second  Champion team and players
Go for the triple!!!!
Diogo jota is a very good player omg!!
What a game  Kieta kelleher chambo minamino jota and  all youngster is on fire
ถ้าโจต้ายิงออก มินามีโน๊ะคงนอนไม่หลับหลายคืนเลยทีเดียว
Best club in the world 🌍😍❤️
Poor leicester bottle fc weak team 😂
Great match!!!!
南野PK外したんかい！
What a game
Watch as Klopp angrily lifts the trophy a couple of months later.
If maddison and vardy doesnt make into england squad the team is doomed
Rumor has it Kasper is still fuming about Firmino's penalty lolololol
Leicester the bottlers!
ในที่สุดก็ได้เห็น เครื่องจักรสีแดงที่เค้าล่ำลือกัน ในยุคKlop..สุดยอดจริงๆ
The 2nd best "come from behind, make it 3-3, win on penalties" that I can think of
Stupid game starting by Klopp
WHO ARE YA? The Leicester fans sang, to a bunch of 16 year olds. I guess they know now.
Liverpool might not be the most decorated club in the world but definitely king of best come backs in history of football belongs to Liverpool thanks for all these good moments ❤️❤️❤️
never start with those second team players again, always lets in like 3-4 goals EVERY cup game.
🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈❤❤❤❤❤
Great comeback. But I hate to see Klopp giving the opponents so much chance to win.
Gomez is so lost
What a match!❤
This is why I love this team.
YNWA YNWA YNWA YNWA YNWA YNWA💪💪💪💪💪💪
Jota was a bargain
Jota can't be stoped
Liverpool❤️💪
Dem dead!
Mina mino like Cristiano Ronaldo in champion league final MU VS Chelsea
Hazi. Why suddenly pool enjoy the draw game.
Lester is not small team anymore
This shows how much Talent Minamono has he should get more recognition
Never give up Liverpool  From somalia 🇸🇴
JOTA
Kelleher, Ox and Taki all had a great game. Kelleher not only for his penalty saves but also saves earlier in the game that kept us within touching distance. Let's win the league cup. YNWA!
Taki!!🤙🤙
My hate turned into respect for Liverpool
Congrats 🎉👏❤  Great game ⚽️🤩
Please jurgen klopp win the title and efl cup so no one will have more premiear leauge than us and champion leauge un england
Looking at the team Leicester put out against our 11 it was extra rewarding to go through. Talk about "hard mode"
Same with MC VS Liv old game
Jota!!!!
City should sack rogers
南野PK外しててわろた
🔥🔥🔥
When Takumi scores James Maddison crumbles to the floor. I fucking love it 🤣
Ox was brilliant this game
Let's be real here  Lfc had half of the usual 1st 11 Otherwise we would've slaughtered leicester  And spurs. Good result. Well done boys.
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Watched it from kop end what a game to watch
Great saves
Even though Mino missed the penalty and the match could have fallen either way, we love him, he was the one who got us to that stage. Nice one Mino....we are with you YNWA
❤
Minamino should go to Bundesliga Unfortunately he can't starting lineup
Konate ,milner,jota made the difference when sec half
Haaaaaa leister got beat by are c team
Nunca dejes de creer ✨YNWA✨
They seem to struggle without Salah, eh?
Good liverpool😎
what's with the rubbish picture quality?
This is what i call a close and exciting game! Well done from both teams though. Good job Liverpool 😘
God Kelleher

Liverpool fan though I am, the defence was woeful. I think Klopp will have to play better guys at the back if he is serious about winning this trophy. That said, there were some real positives: The Ox - showed what a talent he is. I think he is going to have to play a lot of his football in cup games though with the amount of top squad players Klopp has at his disposal, but he's coming back to the kind of form he showed before he got injured. Minamino - Again, proving to be a good cup player who is gaining confidence and becoming a fan fav in cup games. Keita - Flashes of talent, and a useful squad player. Could be useful as the season goes on. FIRMINO - Seriously underrated! He was involved in the buildup to the first two goals and, unlike some other forward players, doesn't mind playing second fiddle to others. I think that, over time, people will put two and two together and give him credit for being one of the most important players in Liverpools success since Jurgen became boss. He would be sorely missed if he were to leave or be sold. The penalty he took also showed his class.
Pepe legend in making ✌️
I was worried about our U21 guys Morton, Koumetio, Bradley, and Neco, and unfortunately Koumetio got schooled by Vardy, but that happens, its on Klopp for throwing those young guys out of the nest  and into the fire maybe a bit too early. I wouldnt have minded them coming on as substitutes if we are winning, but starting a Cup QF game is a big responsibility. And honestly it wasnt necessary cause obviously we had players who can play and what a difference Konate made at CB, what a difference Jota made up front! Keita and Ox brilliant as well! And Callagher absolute hero!  Hopefully they learn from their mistakes and become better, loads of time to improve and grow and learn from these mistakes.
Am I so emotional with this games. I love you guys to death
Didn’t think I cared about the league cup, but last night was special and now I’m desperate for us to win it.
We won it on pens
Minamino is  in fire 💪🇯🇵
bottlers FC at it again.
digno de la premier league
南野とジョタって仲悪いのか？
What a player Jota has turned out to be. Hopefully we go on and win it now
What a goal! Minamino! you can get more goals!! I love you from Japan :)
I love that Diogo celebrated in front of the Leicester fans. What a game!
I hope we take the semi final seriously though.   Does anyone know if it's still over two legs?
Yesss, finally👏👏👏💪💪💪🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻
タキーーー！すばらしい！
Congratulations LVPFC But why is too short video highlights???.
What a match
For me,kelleher is more better than Alison,why?? Kelleher is more quit when the ball coming on his feet,I never see panic on him. Alison become every year Karius,he made us loose against Tottenham and everytime they pass him a ball,I'm panicking. This kelleher deserves some premier league match frankly
ก า ก ม า ก
‘Never write Liverpool off’ True that sir, true that!!
I was watching it in the main stand it was unreal so much more different the kop was wild the hole match
It's a match crazy 😱
Minamino assist jota twice 🔥
Kasper Schmeichel stupid antics, dropped the ball close to himself so he can trash-talk Jota when he goes near him to pick it up. Jota was not having any of it and just stood there. Loved that.
miracle of Istanbul happened again 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Maddison goal was good ❤️❤️
Difficult opening, but we did it
I love Jota
nice
AM SO HAPPY 😭😭😭
what a team
I'm very very happy 😊☺
The fact that we played with boys for 1 half and still beat a fully strength Leicester City says it all!!! Lets get this Cup!! YNWA!!!
Win is our routine
Jota’s celebration at the end 😂👏
Liverpool shouldn't make 2nd team play these matches. It's not always about Champions or Premier league matches but also about these cups as well. It's CL and PL are really important but these consider these games too.
What an incredible crowd tonight you would think it was 2019 and we were putting Barcelona back in there place 😂
سبحان الله ليفربول والاهلي المصري  بيلعبو ضربات جزاء في نفس اليوم ويكسبو هم الاتنين
ngeri bosss
南野いいゴールだったよ！そして、リヴァプールのチームの強さがよくわかる！
Jota for balon d’or
I love 💕 LiverPool ಥ‿ಥ
What a drama from Liverpool
YNWA!
🤓
Beautiful and Effective!!! Well done to LFC!!! YNWA
Well done reds 🔥
amazing match 🔥🔥🔥
Ну хороши команды
Takumiiii!!!
What a cheat Firmino with his penalty. Why did the ref let him get away with it? He was dancing around for ages, then stopped, waited for the keeper to go one way then put it the other side.
the most interesting english club just liverpool... it was written in history... alot match with drama with good endings and entertaining..
Always delighted to watch another win for my favourite team.
Superb...!
We are gonna WIN
Viva Liverpool
Dear opponent This is Anfield ❤️
Magniicent that is the LIVERPOOL spirit. You will never walk alone.!
Absolutely brilliant Liverpool❤
The Leicester fans faces when minamino missed the penalty. PRICELESS 🤣
Lfc vs any team in a penalty shootout: Lfc win.
Jota changed the tempo of the game after being substituted in
Leicester had the game but then Liverpool turn on God Mod
Gomez is so useless
I was their
so mad , last might I miss to watching Liverpool match , but good job everyone player Liverpool 👏 good job 👏 👍 👌
a real cup match that was, omg the ups and downs in it.
急上昇2位おめでとうございます🎉
Beating Leicester XI with these players is amazing.
don't celebrates wining against Liverpool on till the final whistle
What the comeback🔥🔥🔥
You played good Billy. First goal, holding the offside line, some1 plays Vardy onside. 2nd, untimed offside trap from some1. Thank god we won so we can move on with happiness. MERRY XMAS
Liverpools keepers are struggling. Conceding 3 during open play is poor
Support your local authers. Born to be king the seeds are sown by local lad Philip j Lewis
Callaher TANKA
What a bummer. Liverpool really needed to lose this what with all the fixture congestion.......they should have told lads who had other ideas.....
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
COME ON U REDS
Jota is just 25 years old imagine  next 3-4 years with him will be 🔥🔥🔥
Dissapointed from schmeichel
This is so hype. Liverpool always dramatically find a way. Lets' GOOOOOOOO
Man what a show
Very controversial opinion but neco williams dribbling is one of the best in the team
if 95min taki cannot score...?..thk u taki..
Love how your commentator is passive when another team scores but literally screams his head off when y'all score lol
Love you  my favorite football team Liverpool 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
That character, resilience and spirit 👏👏 After the first half no one would believe in the imposible but in the second Liverpool showed that this team is not actually a football team 🤔 It's magic 🤩⚽🎩  YNWA reds, lets go and get the 🏆
you are amazing guys, thank you for this match
*Всем читающим этот комент, крепкого здоровья, исполнения желаний и всех благ!!! ❤*
wonderful game, big respect to liverppol
Keita is such a underrated player
TAKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After analysis,its a proof that England is for the Reds,no one can stop Klopp.imgne full Leicester squad vs young Klopps academy boys.what a match
Never write us off at Anfield!😤
Loved to watch this match great performance by the reds today
Vardy is a very good striker.
👏👏👏👏 reds
I thought Liverpool gonna lose at full time. Unexpectedly, Minamino late goal safe us to penalty. Kellerher 2 spot kick stopper is incredible. Never stop trying until the last whistle blown.
Takumi Minamino scored a late leveller for the Reds after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Diogo Jota had twice reduced the deficit before Caoimhin Kelleher saved two penalties to set up a Carabao Cup semi-final clash with Arsenal.
Absolutely incredible come back ✌
What's a come back
Don't write Liverpool off ✌✌✌
Leave it Brendon to bottle a 2 goal lead…
Well played
Great commentary 😊
Yrs we never walk alone
Leicester goals were only showed once and they were beautiful regards Liverpool being showed twice
Excellent Liverpool FC win 😊
Congratulations to Liverpool player you guys playing well . I'm a Liverpool fan .
Goosebumps, what a Come back, what a win. onto the semi's Reds YNWA.
That Diogo Jota celebration he tried to do it like they do in fifa when you go pick up the ball. classy
I liked the fighting spirit our  boys showed # it is not over untill it is over.  YNWA
No mane no salah no alisson and still win
They just never disappoint their fans. What a strong team👊🏽🙌
That's why I love this club ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟🌟🌟
Can someone tell the commentator how to pronounce the poor keepers name ffs. Its literally KeyVeen not Quavers or whatever he was trying to say.
南野ナイシューあとはPKさえ決めてれば後味最高だった
Beautiful match, from Italy. YNWA!!
Shades of that 5-5 arsenal game
Istanbul 2.0
We are reeds jota is another level he is fantastic player
Joe Gomez is horrible. For a while now
同じ日本人として誇りに思う
Se hace costumbre o será una maldición ya que siempre el que anota el gol del empate en las últimas instancias, termina errando la tanda de penaltis, por qué ya lo e visto en varios partidos.
🔥 🔥 🔥
Nice🔥
I hope there were no unvaccinated people in the stands,or as Klopp calls us,drink and drive.
MAKE LIVERPOOL GREAT AGAIN!
WE ARE LIVERPOOL. WE WANT MORE.
What a comeback! Good Luck Liverpool!!!
YNWA 😍
konate was immense when he came on, ox unreal as well
Honesty I sow the line up and I thought we were gonna be hammered, I'll not question Klopp again
Liverpool are memorable moment this year
Love how the team is coming up together. Lads need more football and they have got it.
what a game it was
cmoooon
Great reds ❤️
This is anfield..
Say what you like about the league cup but that was an exciting game and would love to see us win it.
That shootout was mad, bangers only
Both teams played good as a Liverpool supporter I love when they win gg to all the Lester city fans and LETS GO LIVERPOOL
Beautiful goals in this game
Ox ❤️
Only liverpool will give these absolutely heart pounding trillers  YNWA ..oh I love our team ..Red Army 🚨🚨🚨
Proper number 2 Goalie!

Milner was always there for dramatic last minutes goal. Reminds me of Lovren's header vs Dortmund.
I love how Liverpool goals get replays
Never give up!🔴💪🔥
Congrats from Ethiopia!
Should fight for my life like Liverpool fight for games
GET IN!!! What a comeback, what a finish, what a game!
เรื่องหัวใจหงส์เราไม่เป็นรองใครจริงๆ..สุดยอดๆ
Help me to understand the penalty shootout please. Before it was best to 5 right? And if that even, there is sudden death. But in this video Best to 6? Anyone understand the efl cup rule might care to explain to me?
We love death Manchester united  ..Beautifull
What a game for Liverpool 🔥🔥🔥
❤YNWA❤🥳
been waiting for Taki's 'moment' for the club, cause every player needs that to boost confidence and mark his presence. now we've seen it, so brace ourself for more of Taki's!
Вооот этоо камбэк! Ливерпуль просто так не сдаться!))
BreathTAKIng
It was 11 vs 12, ofcourse Liv was gonna win
Poi

Where is the legendary Divock Origi, is he injured?
Liverpool U23 vs leicester 🤣
What an incredible game from both team 💪🏾
i think i love this team TOO much it's almost unhealthy
Truth be told LEI matches are always a thriller.
JOTA = ROBBIE FOWLER LOVE THAT MAN! I loved how he celebrated in the faces of those shithouse away fans too. Lovely.
Leicester pulled a Spurs and it’s so sad to see
there's no giving up. I will remember this match like istanbul miracle
日本の南野♥️💯
Leicester GK during the pk shootout is so weak
What a game, it seemed over by the 15th minute but the young lads played extremely well against a full side Leicester♥️
Specialist  come back.... merseyside is red's

Liverpool always late🤣
Congrats guys !!! We must win this tournament , win the title , win the champions league , win the Europa Super Cup , win the  Clubs World cup , win , win , and win .
maddisons goal iwas worth two more really. It's a shame they lost but what then again, can't they do at anfield?
Ttp solid ipul, YNWA
What a match 😍❤️
Klopp should not field this line up again, we almost lost this match. Congratulations guys
From the fight shown to the disgusting Leicester chants all match to the best atmosphere all season to the depleted team at the moment to the pandemic which will likely shut crowds out soon, that might have been my favourite match all season. Love it!!!!
"Mr.reliable" hahaha
I used to see Salah in this team. Can anyone update me about that?
Ynwa
almost forgot we still have firmino cause jota is currently on top form now..
🔥
wher mo salah ?
Carabao ronaldo “minamino”
where were salah and mane ?
Minamino, kieta, and ox development is pure class 👌.  Big up to liverpool as a team and Anfield as a stadium 🏟 👏 👍.  To The supporters 🙌 👏 🙏
What a great match!
Fair to say we need a better second choice keeper
Vardy 😳
Diogo Jota was phenomenal.
Now lets do it lets go and win it
Both of teams play attractiive, and enjoyed to watch them
Nobody is talking about konate's defensive display 😅
❤️
where is salah and mane?
Only the refs know why looserfools advance here:)
Jota fuckin beast. Tsimikas and Konate not bad aswell, but Jota....
minamino, cogratulations to win !!　やったぜ、南野。
Yessssssss ⚽️
Minamino is a great player saved us with that beautiful last minute goal and jota doesn't not leave without a goal and outstanding performance from the young lads. If this is not the greatest comeback I don't know what is and let's not forget about Naby Keita🔥🙏🏽
Epic battle 🔥
Love the way Bobby was involved in the first two goals
We will win this time boys
LESS GO KELLAHER
The crowd from the 2-3 goal forwards. Amazing. And the YNWA before the penalties began too
Love liverpool
what a team this liverpool increadible when  leicester leading 3.1 i get they will lose bu't klopp made it substitute ❤️
The miracle of Anfield 😁
Firmino!!!! That guy is amazing! Ultra intelligent level of touch on the ball.
Taki Minamino🇯🇵 1 GOAL ⚽️ 1 ASSIST 🅰️ 1 CROSSBAR CHALLENGE 🥅
Mohammad Salha where
Ууффффф. Каеф
Comeback of the year ❤️
Love LFC.
Kelleher brilliant
Reds is good as able to recover from 1-3. Left leg players tends to have difficulties to score in penalties.
What a game, what a comeback! Boys made a lot of mistakes in the first half, but that what good substitutes and winning mentality means.
Come back liverpool vs leicester,, 3 3 mengingatkan tahun 2005 vs ac milan Winner 👏💪
Great comeback, 👌
Where is salah😞?
Amazing comeback. Great 2nd half performance from the lads.
Menang euy
takumi mina had to wear origi shoes and save liverpool once again

If Jamy were younger than now, he will be playing at Liverpool.
3 opponent goals are never enough to beat Liverpool, lol. Keep going and fight for every title! YNWA
Ynwa siuuu

A job very well done to LFC. We fought tooth and nail for this result. The semi against Arsenal will be a lot of fun. YNWA.
Udah dibilangin kok susah banget ngalahin liverpool
what a night.brilliant
👏👏👏
Something is about to  happened  to Liverpool, what i see is that Liverpool are  beginning to  be receiving  goals last time from Tottenham today  thesame thing  if it was epl you know 2 points  would have  gone
Klop should fix the back three we have a huge problem with our defense.
To Takumi Minamino:   Arigatogozaimasu
Minamino spread his wing again with asist and goal. Apart from penalty miss he is beast
Am sorry but Leicester is a useless team. How do you go 3-1 up against liverpool and still lose?
Mr. Reliable....👏👏👏
WE ARE LIVERPOOL!!!
where's mo salah?
Mantap!
Bruh I fell asleep at halftime
Glory istambul🤣🤣
what a win, and the spirit of come back!!!... this was the same thing that happened against AC-milan... kudos guys
can we see minamino goal from all angles please 🙏
急上昇3位おめでとうございます🎉
Madison🙀
Never Ever Write Off This Team.. ❤
Can we please stop equalising in the 95th minute, lol..not good for the nerves
Great rrsult with young players!
we are the kings of comebacks...
I was at the game it was boss!
Please fix defence for the next matches. Leicester scored their two opening goals in exactly the same way that Tottenham came to chances and goals last week. No VVD shouldn't mean easy goals for rivals.
Henderson in game was a disaster
liverpool woooow 😘😘😘😘
Where Salah?
Two players r missing in this match  ✌️
👎👎👎👎👎
fener leicester ı yener

大改訂版です。 2008年,鈴木京香は桃井かおりと「スキャンダル」というテレビに出演し、桃井ともめた。鈴木は、愛人の大林組会長大林剛郎に訴え、桃井を11年間テレビ界から干した。ウイキペディアの桃井のテレビ出演欄をを見ると、2008年より10年前の10年間は合計1１本テレビドラマに出演しているのに「スキャンダル」出演の後は,2019年の「詐欺の子」まで11年間ゼロである。ゼネコン大林は反社で、そういう力を持っている。大林剛郎と鈴木は威力業務妨害の共同正犯だ。これほど劣悪な人はいない。大林との妾関係は2007年に文芸春秋に暴露され、鈴木は苦し紛れに「会長の奥様と親しいんで３人で会食するだけ」とウソをついた。３人の学童期の子供を抱える神戸東灘区の奥様は「尻振りお京」に会うはずもない。鈴木の虚言癖は有名。 ３人の娘は、父が週刊誌に載り、学校でひどいいじめにあった。 大林は、鈴木を性接待の道具に使った。犯罪である。 ２００８年ソニー盛田昌夫に、深夜、抱きしめられているところをフライデーされ、写真がデカデカと載った。 長谷川博己も最初だけ体関係があったが、後はサントリー佐治信忠会長やトヨタ豊田章男社長や北方謙三や三谷監督やNHK関係者やミツカン酢会長やキリン幹部や大同生命元社長との愛人関係を隠すためのフエイク恋人である。長谷川は見返りとして、トヨタやキリンの宣伝や仕事やお金を得た。 幻冬舎文庫「熔ける」という大王製紙社長の懺悔本がある。芸能界とやくざと財界とテレビの少女売春が描かれている。鬼畜大林剛郎の名前ももちろん出ている。 新堂冬樹の「枕女優」という小説は主人公が鈴木弘子で芸名が水香でもわるうように、三谷監督や大林やサントリーやミツカン酢他の、枕営業の女王として鈴木京香の裏が描かれている。戦後女優の中でも枕のチャンピオンとされるゆえんだ..
Anfield very ANGKER
Takumi Minamino 👍👍🔥🔥💪💪
Klopp time
Why was Salah not in playing 11 ??
Mentality!!!!!
タキ！
King of comeback
Play without md salah
So now Taki gets to know the feeling to score the late late equaliser and Kelleher saving 2 penalties also made a big part in this.  Great game to watch. Never write these lads down, NEVER !!! YNWA !!!
Я болел за Ливерпуля но, лучший игрок по моему Варди.
L'abbiamo fatto di nuovo. Siamo i migliori
Chamberlain can't score easy goals
Minamino performing well, Tomiyasu and Kyogo are killing it too. So proud to see Japanese players surviving in UK footbool scene!! Let's gooooooo
👊💪
The Liverpool team is getting weaker, this always happen towards the end of the year/break. Hope you come back strong 💪
NO SALAH,  NO MANE, NO ALLISON,  NO PROBLEM
Jota will be in the same level as torres
Lol just when Leicester thought they would have a chance to get their hands on a trophy🤣🤣🤣
Jota always scores replacement of firmino?
I love Liverpool

Liverpool. You Never Walk Alone and Never give up.
TAKI!!!!!
Can't wait to see BR's reaction after the final penalty! )
PKは決めて欲しかったけど、重要な場面での得点最高でした！スタメンは厳しい状況だけど、いつか報われる事を願っています🙏
É isso aí meu portuga, mlk vem jogando excelente hein

To anyone who doubted Minamino when he was loaned out in 2020, this is why Minamino was signed on.

If you think your day was bad, remember that Brendan Rodgers bottled a 2 goal lead against Liverpool 'C' team with his main team.
The kings of inconsistency Leicester  city....
This is liverpool without selfies mane
Insane Match 👍
南野ナイス👍
MR. RELIABLE!!!
It looks like a FIFA match XD
I’m proud of my team ❤️
Loosing hope and giving up isn't a my team's thing, we're Liverpool and this means more👌!YNWA💪♥️❤️!
Takiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!
My team 🔥🔥🔥
Wow  What a dramatic game
Liverpool play their under 17s and still win. Gotta love it!!!!

greetings from Man City 💙🤟
LFC tv not showing liceister goals replay but they will show liverpools goal 4 times  from different angles...😂😂😂
นึกว่าดูบอลชิงแชมป์UCl สุดมันเลย นักเตะก้ตัวหลักๆทั้งนั้น คุณภาพคับ
This is liverpool🤩🤩🤩
Good subs. Some of the young boys still were not ready to play in big games. But Neco and Kelleher were outstanding.
Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.
I think we should start giving the Minamino guy more more time
Minamino
After konate was brought I didn't see vardy he was really controlled by konate
thank you takumi!!
I WANT THE CARABAO CUP YNWA🔴🔴🔴
Kelleher dan jotaa memangg hebatt nicee .salam liverpool indonesiaa🔥🔥🔥
Alisson's deputy : Kelleher 👏
This is liverpools best era ever .
This team is something different 🔴⚪️
Ливерпуль ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
vay aqqqqq
- Koumetio + Bradley musti banyak belajar lagi! - Neco ga bisa dipaksain main di sayap! - Morton + Becks Mantap!🔥  More young player to RISE! (Curtis, Dixon, Cain, Clarkson, Quansah, Marcelo)👏👏 YNWA! ☕🇮🇩
LOVE THIS <3
This commentator always sounds like he's got a lot of phlegm stuck in his throat.
very painful
Minamino is the MoM - 1 assist, 1 goal and 1 penalty missed :)
TAKI IS JUST SOMETHING ELSE 💨
Don’t you sometimes wish you supported another team. My poor heart ❤️ YNWA
이게 리버풀이며, 여기는 안필드 이다. This is Liverpool, and this is Anfield.
Bener jago save pinalti kelleher

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Diogo Jota is a such a great signing. Simply sensational
fyuuuh that was close
Mtakuja kutuuwa nyie wasenge
Think if Salah here there would be no penalty shootout 😎
Mtakuja kutuuwa nyie wasenge
❤️❤️❤️
Tak menang kata piala ni tak penting,perangai macam fans Mun united 🤣,bila menang tukar balik kata2
Fantastic
joe gomez is a joke, Nathaniel Phillips is better than him
What a game I’ve missed tonight.  Stick in Texas for Christmas
awesome
Liverpool time👍
The youngsters almost ruined the game. Luck the elites were ready to finish the job.
🗣 "I am really, really happy. Really happy with the performance, with the spirit, with the mentality, in a lot of moments with the football."  Jürgen Klopp on another memorable night at Anfield 🙌
Watching this team play, inspires me a lot. The 'never giving up spirit' and the belief.
yeah...we are liverpool....the best football team in the world
The first 6 penalties were just perfectly taken
Another epic comeback from Liverpool!!!
Bravo, Boys! Giving this kind of opportunity to the young lads is a great decision by JK; this is how we can maintain the culture of the club.
never write Liverpool off!
We missing Salah and mane... Otherwise it would be 5-3
What a comeback
It's time people start appreciating Jota
Nice 😁👍
What a team is this, love you always!
Amazingg
The way Jota celebrates in front of them was BEAUTIFUL😍😍 GET IN!!
Great game! Go Reds!!
splendid!!😳😳
With Diogo Jota fit we might win the carabao Cup
Jota🔥🔥🔥
Imprissed by Williams. He was amazing ✨
Minamino deserves more play time!
Liverpool was Rocking.. probably the loudest this season! That second half was simply amazing
Good performance and i‘m happy to see Taki to play like this
Good job LIVERPOOL F.C and win the the EFL
Please appreciate Minamino's assist to Jota and the last-minute goal
Mentality👏🏻🔥
Good thing liverpool have Klopp. Leicester FC lined up strongly, but thwarted by Klopp substitutions.
Do not mess with Liverpool
Dramatis euy.. 😁good 👍liverpool
Liverpool conceding too much for last few matches
Pokoknya ngeri.. comeback again
🇪🇬🇪🇬A fan of Liverpool from Egypt and I thank Mohamed Salah for this wonderful effort
AwwwwwwwA
Varldy always love liverpool net.
What a game! man 😅👊🏻
Poor line up
MOTM ... the crowd ! absloutly amazing !!
Jota minamino chamberlain
Taki!!!
Ngeri 🔥👏
i think klopp and his team of coaches could nurture n develop Konate into a defensive midfielder? His pace and physicality are assets and his distribution is spot on and if it goes to another level i feel he could play both in defence and midfield!
Sama kek final pas lwn milan di ucl ga sih😂
its funny that the top teams always send the first team in carabona cup and LFC the second or third players and Liverpool in the end win
สุดยอด😍😍
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What an electrifying game. Incredible fighting spirit from the lads. So so proud to be an LFC supporter....even when we were 2-0 down I swear I could feel Anfield shake with the supporters' energy and passion. I could have lived in that moment forever.
Aku putar berkali2 😁
WE'LL NEVER WALK ALONE WE ARE REDS WE ARE POOL'SFANS
Mantap pul
Leicester is really good tho
This is the first time I would love to watch the full highlights. Incredible game.
What a game … imagine it was a UCL game . Our kids would talk about it …
Epic comeback
The lads❤️ really gave💪🏽 it a good shot against a full strength Leicester💙 side Way to go lads🙌🏽 •we're Liverpool we walk on with hope in our hearts ❤️💪🏽💯
Jota 🥰 this man is unreal , good performance from Minamino too , and Chamberlain was class
Not a fan of Liverpool but Minamino 🙌 is amazing 🤩
nnnnnnnvvvv
Awesome
kelleher don't deserve to be a backup GK anymore. too bad we already have Alisson
We need that cup too MR KLOP (❤️) 🙏
Love Konate
What a goal from James Madison,♥️
See ya Brenda YNWA Redmen
Add the clock on these videos. It's annoying without
I like how none of the Leicester goals have replays, but all the Liverpool goals have replays.
I think Liverpool do not have second team
Brilliant!!!!
seriously liverpool need quality RB like trent..neco can't cross like trent,always cross low..young LB shown great performance even been sub
Yes liverpool
Mantapp
I don't know why but, Liverpool is always lucky. Always.
Minamino - Firmino - Jota for January seems okay to me as long the blockbuster midfield trio in Thiago - Fabinho - Keita play together as well
What a come back reds 😈😈😈
What a game
YESSSS TAAAKKKIIIIIIIIIII!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:24 goalie's feet appear to be off the line a few frames before that kick, so idk if they deserved that win but great comeback by Liverpool
Gomez out
Minamino is officially Mr. Carabao!
日本人としてミナミノの活躍は嬉しい！！
When this game?old?
Salah Missing 🔥
Minamino:  1 Goal 1 assist 1 Lose Penalty shoot 😀
Tanpa mane dan salah
Where is the time clock?
MINAMINOOOOOOH !!!!! 🔥🔴❤️
Great. Liverpool played with most of the youngsters or 2nd team. While Leicester played with almost a 1st team players. Anyway we outclassed them with style and down goes Leicester. Nothing is impossible. Great win. YNWA from Singapore
Minamino Cup
Taki is really good even tho he miss the pen , one assist and one equalizer at the critical moment!!!!   He deserves more chances
Kelleher our future 🧤
Liverpool best football club in England no doubt.
Carabao is always fixed
Please do an every angle for Taki’s last minute goal 🙏🏼 Thank you
Comeback king

"In my time at Anfield we always said we had the best two teams on Merseyside - Liverpool and Liverpool reserves." - Bill Shankly
Takumi needs more minutes. I trust his ability
Tielemans to Liverpool !!!!!!!
Magnificent
Not Suprised. Liverpool is now used to "making comebacks".
Amazing Boys am so glad , you did it .
Never give up 🙏❤ YNWA
The KING of Comebacks 🔥🔥🔥🔥!No Origi no problem we've got  Minamino 🔥🔥🔥 even he missed the penalty he deserved to score the last minute goal !! 🔥🔥🔥
YNWA
I’m Japanese. Thank you Diogo and Kelleher to recover Taki’s penalty miss.  I support everyone of Liverpool from Japan.  Sorry for my poor English.
Without Mane and Salah and Van Dijk and Alisson still beat Leicester. This will give lot of confidence to the team ahead of the semi finals esp. as they will be without the magic duo  in the team.
Life is all about comebacks.
Very nice
Well, Liverfool only had a comeback because its a weak leicester side.  no chance of anything in the semi final.  You will walk the fk alone
wow... niceday
Firmino is back baby
what a game
WOOOOWWWWW....
Another deep in injury time goal to add to the collection!
Can't wait for inside anfield
Let Gomez go he is not good for Liverpool, we will get more problems when he is on
😀💪
The Madison goal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
We are Liverpool, it means more!!!!
🎧❤️🙏🚭⚽🏓🍵🌷🍊🍏🍒😁 . !)
Khelleher should the first team !!
This guy Diego jota and menamimo they are really good
Enjoy this victory Liverpool while it lasts we will see you again at 29th December
'How'd you fluke that one then?'
Cup ties at Anfield with the Kop are surely magical. What a match and performance by LFC.

WHAT A MATCH
Assalamualaikum WORLD ❤️
Very important look what Firmino did at 0:27 diving 😊
فين صلاح
Minamino a true Japanese spirit, never give up until the very last.
To be honest I was a bit nervous when Liverpool put out this squad in a semi-final but after what happened it was an extraordinary thing.
Cool penalty from firmino ❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 I ask the management of Liverpool Club, my beloved team and my love since childhood, to send me an invitation to see the Egyptian king playing for my favorite team. I hope that the administration will agree or any fan will send me an invitation to attend 🇪🇬❤🇬🇧🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Leicester deserved the win after Maddison's screamer
Kelleher and Jota! What a passion!
Thank you so much for the emotions
This is Anfield
Hw the fk did leicester bottle this up? Lol
すごい！南野は日本の星だよ！！
Love to see Minamino scored from🇰🇭👍🇯🇵
Diogo Jota is a superstar in the making. What a lethal striker he has become. Props to Jurgen for transforming these kids to beasts.
We wont give up we keep going
Cool Bobby 😎
Another magical performance at Anfield after UCL match against Barça (started with 0-3 agg.), since this winning was determined by a goal on additional time and superb performance on additional pen. shootout.  Despite winning this match, recent defensive performance is worrying (allowing 6 goals in the last three matches). So please... don't get complacent lads!
超満員のアンフィールドで大歓声を受けるタキは日本の誇り。
Taki would have been the big hero of the day if he would have scored the penalty. Still a great late goal to equalize. Way to go Taki. One of my favorites player from the Liverpool squad
Diogo jota 🙏❤
The comeback kings are back in action
Am a Tottenham fan...pray you ain't drawn with us...just pray
Jota is the best 🔥
where salah ?
Iseh wayahe menang
Liverpool 🌝❤
Unbelieveable.never stop winning.
YNWA❤️
The first goal by vardy, kelleher didn't really have to fall down like that 🙃
Anfield is Tanbul
Great Win. I just watched the replay. Well done lads into the Semi finals. Lets go win that match and win the Final.  Jota is a Machine.  Minamino equalizer was a Gem.  YNWA.
that's more i like 🔥
Well done caoimhin kelleher proud of you many more to go👏
PK決めとけよ... でも1A1Gの活躍は素晴らしい！！！！！
3-1 lead completely wasted..🤦‍♂️
Was the commentator sick last night. What a boring commentation to one of this season's great games!
I miss My Salaaaaah😭😭😭😭
Well played Liverpool 👏🏻❤️🔥
It ain't over till it's over..
Kayaknya ... Semua gelar bakal disabet Liverpool deh !
What a team!
U all did great job 🔥
Best soccer in the world
Match of the day 👍 Congratulations Liverpool !👍 Hard luck Leicester!👍 Thank you to everyone👍

Клопп ты просто ..... слепой 👍👍👍 привёл таких игроков как мина,жота
Miracle
Diogo jota what a signing, a legend in the making 👏
I wonder whether Klopp was actually happy. Every season he tries so hard to just get eleminated from this competition 😂😂😂
This team NEVER give up!
Crazy Liverpool. They beat Leicester with second tier player
Minami. Its ok dudeee
Comeback😜
화끈하누?
What a epic night full of action packed football and emotion roll caster.  We are Liverpool Football Club and that means more  YNWA
Jota goat 🐐

Liverpool …🔥🔥🔥🔥 YNWA…Jota and Salah will take Liverpool to every glory which  they deserve…
Super liverpool FC, Merry Christmas!!!!
Taki is phenomenal, thanks to his late equaliser,sent us to the penalty shootout and let kelleher shines

TAKIIIIIII!!!!

Merry Christmas
Liverpool 💪 TOP
Viva livapol fns
The of comeback nih h BoSQu🥳
Commentator 1.Liverpool is not taking this lying down. 2. Never write Liverpool off. 3. Not giving this up without a fight.   Yeah, baby.
Liverpool is a so strong team with Mohamed Salah but they are a strong team without him
We have ORI.. Oh wait, it's PK..WE HAVE KELLEHER!!!
What a match up reds
Let's go red's

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
フィルミーノがやっぱり起点になってるけど、調子落としてるのかな？
Too many youngsters for quarter final and Leicester take it seriously. Luckily we have taki and kelleher.
Couldn't describe the feeling that Reds pull it through. Keep it going, YNWA!
Taki   i love U
Bread 🍞👍
Inspirational Go on you REDS!!! YNWA
You'll Never walk Alone 👍🏻👍🏻
Liverpool power ♥️
They just don't do it in easy way
It gives me literally chills, when I feel like liverpool could be going for a treble this season. Finger crossed there is a large part of this season left. But nothing would makes us happy or make this lfc team more legendary if not 4 a treble, it's the cherry on the top.
Joss sip, i love Liverpool
Super comeback
Firmino rocks!
Prefer to have the TIME in your highlights. Please don't remove it.
Liverpool can do the impossible ❤️
We really missed Origi in this match!
Comeback specialist
I like this guy diogo jota. He look like a cool guy but slowly he is becoming a thorn to opponents.
JOTAAAAAA
Alison no play
Imagine celebrating the way Leicester did just to get knocked out
I almost got a heart attack when Minamino missed the penalty :)
What a comeback 😍🔥. YNWA ❤️
diego jota always scores
Kelleher the saver. Love to see such match
we didn’t quit when we’re losing because we knew the players will comeback stronger and harder
King
When I started to watch in the second half, they won I didnt watch the first half
Where is Origi?
Liverpool Reeds 💪 Anfield ❤️
Это называется характер.
What a game of football
Honestly I thought Liverpool would be beaten 7-1,I went to sleep even before first half ended. I'm here just wondering how we won😁😁🔥🔥
Glad it was Kelleher, If Allison Liverpool could lose. He's so bad on penalty
What a comeback!!! ❤️‍🔥
very good is macth
what a team
WHAT A COMEBACK🔴🔴🔴🔴
Firmino minamino jota wow🔥🔥

클롭의 부대를 난 좋아해.미니미노도 오늘 잘했어.강력한 리버플 만세!

Another comeback victory. Never write us of. On we go to the SEMI.
We Japanese are all proud of Taki!!!🇯🇵 Great win!!!
Amazing team!!!
Liverpool--> Comeback specialist. Wow!! YNWA
Sensesnal come back Liverpool.
Leicester played their first team btw, props to our youngsters and rotating substitutes for stepping it up and playing so well. Minamino and Kelleher killed it, but don't take anything away from Keita, created so many chances and kept the pressure on Leicester the whole game.
Oxlade,jota,minamino and kelleher 💕💕💕💕💕  I love you Liverpool
6 shooter?? 😮
BOBBY'S BACK.
Penalty shootouts are all for kellher now 🥰
Minamino cuando erro el penal : わたしは すて" に の ちやくちやく になりました。😁

“Mentality monsters” bro just say Comeback kings instead. It has a better ring to it
Good match 👍
East or west Liverpool is the best🙂
sudah kubilang jangan senang dulu, king Liverpool nih jagoan saya🔥
The mentality monsters are back! Priorities? Yes, but we are Liverpool, and we want to be challenging for every silverware available.
Fucking mentality giants
Hoki
Nothing beats Liverpool's best team. go liverpool..Go liverpool 🏆
Carabao in Indonesia is mean cow. Carabao  is traditonal language in West Sumatera, Indonesia
Good game, raw nerves, true grit to the end for Liverpool. A ball -wrangling game !
Come On We are Reds & We Never Give Up 🙏
Don't think Arsenal wil take you to see penalties 😂😂😂
Congrats liverpool
So proud to be red!
bobby penalty = epic

Full marks to the production for showing the Leicester city goals in seconds while fast forwarding to the Liverpool come back!😂
Jota saved takumi
Where mo salah..?
リバプール最高のチーム！最高のファン！　女を初めて知った時くらい興奮したぜ
magnificent pol
Minamino is king of volley ball japan❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️this player is amazing
I really loved the Jota scored that last penalty... he is always so passionate and angry when we lose and win This guy is a gem Leicester though they can win easy at Annfield and Vardy with that pub attitude  :) Hopefully with the a team we will beat them again
english commentary is really boring
🥺🥺
Liverpool supper champion and supper Kloop lion futbool
Game of the season contender
Always proud moment to watch Liverpool playing ❤️❤️❤️
Yessss Liverpool FC
What a nostalgic game,it reminded me of the 5-5 game against arsenal in the carabao cup which we won on 5-4 in the penalty shootout.
Come back , 🔥
OMG, this league game is more entertaining than EPL
南野最高！欲を言えばPK決めてヒーローになってる姿を見たかった😄
what a game ?
"Liverpool's Mr Reliable, and he still Liverpool's Mr Reliable" couldn't describe Milner better 💪
Love beating the Leicester starting XI with our B team. Shows the depth we’ve got and the potential that a lot of our players possess.
Taki💙💚💛💜❤💗💖
King comeback haha
What a come back from Mr Reliable
That 95th minute Taki's volley Kelleher the savior  Jota the destroyer.  Whatta game. Whatta comeback.
Takumi Mnghiguainkan diri 😂
YNWA LIVERPOOL. ........ Best game so for this season..
Clearly klopp was just gambling with this team he wasn't interested to win but they sill gave him a win after all
as soon as Konate came in,the spaces for Vardy suddenly closed
I could see fans of two teams not wearing face masks not respecting social distance is that means this stadium is Omicron free? cause this is the reason behind AFRICAN CUP OF NATIONS 2022 sabotage by UEFA.
Good job by Kelleher 👊👊👊👊🎊🎊🎊 YNWA
# YNWA tetap.... This is Anfiels.... Bro
PKはずしたんかーい
Playing koumetio with vardy and dakas pace and koumetios lack of pace was madness... Konate fixed that and gomez was very rusty
im crying. what a game!
Typical liverpool 😍😍
Again..again..again... Lostime berdarah 🔥🔥🔥
Unbelievable performance by Kelleher, Jota amd Minamino!!!  All the team are Gladiators!  YNWA!!!
Beautiful goals and great saves from Kelleher in the shoot-out
Feel our's comeback power
🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Super Liverpool
Damn you LIVERPOOL really make it impossible to stop loving
In Semi finals Liverpool must play with first team players
Mentality monster in every player tier ... such an amazing gift from Klopp to LFC .. Congrats
Best of Liverpool!
Never write us off, what a team, i love them so much
What a match 🔥🤯😳 Leicester always play with hearth and soul 👏🏻💪🏻 RESPECT
Liverpool  has brought back life and prestige to Carabao Cup with this epic performance.
We were left behind in the first half, almost lost the game. Maybe Klopp needs to take this competition more seriously. I know we need to rest our main players, and give a chance to the youngsters, but it's quarter final. We're almost there, the final. Even this cup isn't that precious, but it's better to get one cup than nothing imo.
Minamino drama...huhu
No longer content with just being mentality monsters, we're just mentality demons right now. Slaying all who dare cross us. Go Reds! YNWA.
Bobby Firmino plays for the team.
これで優勝したら 実質南野やん....
i thought we are gonna lose but we won
Well Done Liverpool ❤️❤️
This is livpool
I guess the reserves just didn't want to bow out in a meek way but I can imagine Klopp fuming on the inside 😄
Liverpool. King of comebacks!!!
Always gonna be Liverpool fan... RedsForLife🔥🔥... YNWA
Kelleher was a hero!I was going to say to sub on aLlison but we didn’t need it
Yg semalem nonton streaming, bersabar lah, karena tim ini akan berjuang sampe akhir. Btw, tim tim yg di comeback sama LFC, gmn perasaannya ya 😄😄
D. Jota on fire, comeback is real,
Thank you, TAKI !💥
As an away team; winning at Anfield is a myth; It doesn't exist; It's useless; It's like chasing the wind. On a sidebar; If I were to be held at gunpoint and a penalty is decided as my way out; I want Milner to take the penalty..
I shouted and yelled alone in my house in Japan while watching this game haha Everyone did good job o7
These portuguese players are literally on different level this season..Bernardo, cancelo,bruno,jota,Ronaldo,dias and the names goes on..Their stats and gamechanging performance on the pitch absolute class. This mighybe  the golden age of portugal worldcup22.
So lucky
Nice im so happy to support you! I remember the first time i see you on my tv i was 11 yo it was a champions's league game against standard (a team from my country). I feel in love for ya. Thanks for all the feeling Liverpool! And thanks Jurgen for your awesome work!
YNWA
Why are there so many Away fans in the Anfield Road Stand? Don’t they normally allocate a few thousand seats to Away fans…..
Left footers aren't good in penalty shootouts.
mentality MONSTERS
Glad to see the fans cheering for Minamino even tho he missed. And Diogo saving our asses what a signing
Pengumuman...........  In Sya Allah Bayu nanti ada usaha kosan 20 pintu di rawa jaya di dkat kmpus Uin Palembang di tmpt tmpt yg strategis
OMG Liverpool fans are delusional! That keeper suck and will never be anything big! Mina will never be better but hey it took you 20? years to win again so celebrate and think you gonna stay there
I couldnt see the match live but looking at  this highlight it must have been an adrenaline rush and full of goosebumbs moments.
minamiiiiiinooo (๑´ڡ`๑)👍🇯🇵
Love to see Jota's spirit..
Mantap 👍
Anfield 🔥🔥🔥
The commentary was dead.
Imagine this match without fans? Maybe we wouldn't see that Liverpool's comeback. Love English football for matches like this one!
Ynwa
The spirit of the PHOENIX never fly alone..💯
No Anfield No Party..😂👍
Mantap
Y do shitpool gets lucky everytime?
Mino kuuuun
Diogo Jota is a 💎
I did not trust Kellehar at first half because 1st half was bad🤦🏼‍♂️ Kellehar trust:4/10👎🏽 Alisson trust :9/10👍🏽
I went to bed sad at 3-1😢 I woke to this 😅
Enfield saved u and although vardy was a terror for them as usual
Lucky
Spirit of Istanbul
This was a hard fought win! Well done boys!  👏🏻👏🏻❤
*This is Anfield*
Well, 1 goal and 1 assist. Too bad for the pens, should've been better.. but overall performace ain't too bad for Taki.. Clearly there's many room for improvement, but just keep striving like always.  You got Jota for an excellent example, he always bring the best when needed. Origi too, scoring when it matters the most.  So.. Ganbatte!!
Takiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Bobby’s pen tho 🤤 🔥
What a fucking game 🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆
After naby keita brought in, the game changed
Firmino the unsung hero!
Really great Liverpool Winner Champions Carabao Cup 2021
When you walk through a storm hold your head up high and don’t be afraid of the dark ….. at the end of a storm there’s a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark … walk on .. through the wind  walk on … through the rain tho you dream be tossed and blown …. Walk on walk on with hope In your heart and you’ll never walk alone
Minamino...great player in this match...arigato
Theeeeee🔥
I just love AOC strikes Also I wish Vardy played for us. 1 of the most underrated striker
Minamino(the samurai) 1goal 1assist
Leicester 3-1 up. Then still lose. Inexcusable for me. Time for Rodgers to go he still cannot address the defense week in week out. Shambolic.
南野〜！
Our lads will not quit
Good Liverpool, Road to semi final👍
Why wasn't Salah , Mane , Robertson ,Virgil ,milner ,origi ,any of them  playing?
hahahaha the leicester fans were such arses, only to be brought back down with their faces buried in them
Muhammad qasim dreams true and he is imam mahdi
Next match we need to deploy our full strength and not allow Salah, Mane and Keita to leave for AFCON.
What a game!
No time to give up keep the spirit goes on 🔥💪 Well done Liverpool lads. They were on 🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
That Maddison strike deserves a replay
Thanks for the video
Let me say as a Japanese.  Minamino's goal and PK failure made me lose track of my feelings. I was confused. As a result, it was good that the team won.
Fire 🔥
I almost die 😅what a game lads!!! ❤️❤️❤️YNWA
Probably not our best line-up, but the boys do have the passion and the drive. They simply never gave up like true Redmen. Bravo, lads! What a fight!
Amazing liverpool..👏👍
Kelleher 👍🏻 Joe gomez and Billy very poor performance
Congrats ❤️
Gol gol gollll gooooollll YNWA 🔥
everytime kelleher has stepped foot onto the pitch this season he’s been outstanding
Finally a goal from the Ox!!! Get in!!!
Some lessons for the young'uns, but goodness me.. What a front 3.. The link up to the Jota goal is the epitome of modern forwards. And Caoimhin Kelleher 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
YNWA...❣️🔥😎
Tak-Taki
Taki miss a penalty Taki : .... Jota : Leave it to me.
Great match from liverpool
Loris Karius is better than Adrian and Kelleher
Minamino
What a brutal mentality this Liverpool team has, never giving up and struggling until the final whistle.
Was mo Salah wearing the never give up shirt
Epic comeback...YNWA 👍👍👍
When Minamino missed the PK ,Leicester supporter was big laughing like made fun of him so I became hate them
Keleher looking lik Tim Krull with that moustace
Takumi Minaminoooooo 🎌🇯🇵🎌🇯🇵
I love seeing Takumi shine
Always delighted to watch another win for my favourite team.

Why is our team highlights is always short??we want to see more footage not just 2 mins highlights
Waooh ,what a fighting spirit .well done Guys .
Good Job for Liverpool.🙏👍
Taki with a great assist and a monsterous goal. Pity the penalty miss, but thats what a penalty kick is all about. Scoring a penalty is the hardest thing to do IMO.
Good liverpool
Nice
nice win iverppol
Kelleher was outstanding little underated in my opnion, minamino is having a good season even with little appearences he still manages to grab goals and contributions. Lets go on to win the title boys! Up the Reds 🔴

Minamino is proud of his success as a Japanese🔥
ขนาดเลสเตอร์ชุดใหญ่นะเนี่ย
jota right foot
TAAAKIII 🔥
Diogo Jota new CR
Why all our goalkeeper looks weak?
If Allison played in this match, it would have been a 3-0 win and a thank you goodnight instead of a pathetic penalty shootout.
Liverpool with a great comeback of 3-1 down
CONGRATULATIONS  MY LIVERPOOL TEAM YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE.
Everything about omicron in UK is bullshit right?
YNWA
Where is allison
The come bk kings
오 미나미노 1골 1어시 굳 잘했네
I stg jota is the most underrated player in the world rn
Thats why Klopp not really having any headache in transfer window. Its not the quality of a single player, its gel and blending of a team that makes things happen
Good game
Another pathetic draw, Man City is winning their way to the EPL title.  Wake Up Liverpool
Tes

Entertaining game. The long range goals scored by Chamberlain for Liverpool and by James Maddison for Leicester will remain itched in memory for a long time.
This game let e remember the ucl 2005 final
M E N T A L I T Y  M O N S  T E R
Never wrote Liverpool off! We can make miracles happen even in stoppage time - be it 1 min or even 1 second
Go Go Go....

They poked the bear 🐻 😡.    It’s an honor to be a Liverpool Fan 😎
minamino equalizer is like Japanese manga 😂
Minamino se merece tener continuidad asistencia y gol del empate. Ahí tienen el futuro delantero si se va Shala o Mane, felicidades Minamino saludos desde Uruguay 🇺🇾🇺🇾⚽⚽⚽🇺🇾🇺🇾
Minamino is an absolute baller
Por estos partidos la premier es la mejor liga del Mundo!
Luis Suarez x Sergio Aguero = Diogo Jota

too many heroes in this match.. Kelleher was Outstanding.. very underrated goalkeeper. Great comeback!
Liverpool + comeback = sensational.
Never give up untill the final whistle blows. That's Liverpool. 💯❤️
Wow amazing
Jota’s celebration at the end though. Serves them foxes fans right. 🤣🤣🤣
I thought Jota was left-footed.
GG
Great performance but now we gotta soldier through a tough January once again
Excellent from Liverpool 👏🏻 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Liverpool = Never give up!!! 🔴♥️
Liverpool ini bos, jagonya comeback terus di lanjutin adu penalti. Skor sama mirip final piala FA 2006 🔥

Minamino and Origi, when they play, a miracle can happen !
Jota is semsational
Love Leicester. A real attacking team.
Good job Liverpool
Sincerely hope we win this cup, for a long time we have let it go . Next up arsenal. Hope we continue in the same vein. We can do it this time. YNWA.
Way to go Taki ... an equilizer at extra time ... you made this happen
We haven't reach final in any domestic cup.. let's do this!! YNWA!!
Minamino cup...!!! 😍😍😘😘
Parabéns 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fantastic🔥
Ура ура ура!)))
YNWA
Minamino deserve the Man of the Match here. Even though he missed the penalty.  He actually save the team by held the scoreline at the very last minute!
comeback is real
Kelihatan sekali ketidak percayaan diri dari Leicester city Selebrasinya gak lepas senyum 🤣
Taki taki, ¡rumba!!!!
Taki performance 📈📈📈📈
ALWAYS  LIVERPOOL ALWAYS ALWAYS  ALWAYS LIVERPOOL       FROM    MAURITIUS
Liverpool mental juara bos👏👍
Jota the Iron Man!
Mental skuad Liverpool luarbiasa
You don’t understand how much I love Jota ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Minamino is the best footballer in Asia next one  And he should be man of the match this game
What a game!
We did it...🔥🔥
00:14 look at vardy what a speed , he was behind Alexqnder!
Alus lanjutkan
Selamat buat livelpool Slam from indonesia
Mantapppppp lordddddddcapital
WHAT A MATCH !!! AND THAT MINAMINO'S STRIKE... WON-DER-FUL !!!
I wouldn't be surprised if Morton won't play again in quite some time. This kid can't defend and because of that he is useless. If at least he was running, but no, 16 years older Millner was working harder in defense.
Alhamdulillah, YNWA cop
Mantap
Proud as always! 🙌

What a great game by the lads..never give up, though Taki missed a pen, but credit to him for equalizing 3-3 at 95 mins..Keep going Taki, in Klopp we trust, die hard Liverpool Fan from Malaysia 🇲🇾
It'a crazy..crazy game. Keep it up, redmen
I love Jota... doesn't scare out of agitating and shouting to the opposite fans. Love him...old school don't give a fu#$ passion.
Another great come back on the list.. 👍🏿

Lets win this thing Reds
Finiamino did gud
Pokonamah liverpool sae pisan..
Please play first team in semis....We have to win the title....
Klopp messed up with the lineup in the first half. Great to make a comeback second half
Champion mentality. What a comeback
Minamino missed an opportunity to be Liverpool’s hero TWICE by missing the last penalty.
Tôi yêu các bạn
Time for Arteta to worry. Time for Arteta to think about Aubameyang again. Aubameyang had knocked out city and defeated Chelsea on the final of FA cup. Arteta bring your kids team and see how Liverpool willl demolish them. Well done Liverpool
Yok bisa yok Minamino
What are come back 🤍🤍🤍🤍🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴💛💛💛💛💛👑👑👑👑👑
It was just enough
FATY IS THE BEST TODAY 👍

YNWA

Hats off to Keita, Konate and Jota... Total game changers. Also Chambo and Khelleher were amazing today. 🔥🔥🔥
It looks like UCL atmosphere
Well done taki! Love him ❤️❤️  in korea it was 6am however i just shouted about takis goal

Amazing match ❤️🔴🦅
Can our Portugal player be better than CR7? On the way👍
Never give up again and again!
make a Carabao Cup match like UCL knock out match, just LFC did it.
Waoooo....
Foxes amazing
D Jota - the next name to sing at ANFIELD !
Great #2 Goal Keeper. And glad to have Jota and Minamino. Of course Ox scores bangers.
number 9 is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Gerrard!!!!" was in his head as Minamino took that 95th min shot
You cannot write this stuff down bruv, we never give up and no one should give up this shows that if you work hard you will succeed... YNWA❤❤
Always amazed by  the spirit!!!everytime we play in anfield is always magical!!!!YNWA
Fucking loved Jota giving it large to them Tory twats after he slotted... MAGIC MAN
The second Goal is shitty .. because Vardy be sprinting to open space  n my homie don't even try to commit a tactical foul.. anyways good win
Jürgen . Building a dynasty . Mainz. Dortmund. Liverpool. Compares with Fergie, Paisley, Pep, Clough. One of the finest managers in world football history.  Merry Xmas Everton 🥳🥳🥳
Another magical night of my dear Liverpool ... Greetings from Perú 🇵🇪 ... YNWA!!
Love you  Taki ❤️
Firmino was the key for chamberlain and jota goals. What a player
the spirit LFC is the best in world, stadium, players, supporter, and mr.klopp... i think now is the best in modern era...
Is it necessary to mention descent and race? bad commentator..  2:20
Great Minamino！ As a Japanese I'm glad his goal .  Liverpool is wonderful team because this team never give up. I wana continue to see their game. Thanks
this guy diogoal jota is a beauty to watch 👏
Liverpool king of comeback
What a memorable night for the reds YNWA
👍👍👍👍👍
After all the years and the titles lost Finally we have a worthy second GK
Takumi with a goal and assist 🔥🔥
Minamino the samurai!!
Assalamualaikum Alhamdulillah Allahuakbar Allahuakbar Allahuakbar..this is Liverpool FC.. NOTED..ok
Por qué  no atajo alisson?
I've been waiting for takumi to show how good he is, can't wait for the world to see his best!
This is Anfield 😍
Please stop putting the results in the title. Even NBCSports does this properly…
James Bond gave us "No Time to Die".  Liverpool gave us "Never Say Die"!  Liverpool For Life!!👏👏👏
Always
OUR BOYS, OUR TEAM
Liverpool is such a poetic team in the world, that's why i love Liverpool soooooo muchhhh!
WHAT A GAME
🇧🇷❤️🤍
The goalkeeper   Made it possible for Liverpool win
Te amo Liverpool🦩🔴!!!!
What a time it is to be a Liverpool fan✨!
Minamino cup 😍
we were too happy. now how we will react in final if we win. make more drama
Taki, let's practice PK now
Why didnt Salah, Mane, Firmino, Dijk play?
What a game , what a comeback
Not gonna lie, Vardy is hell of a striker..
If Allison is injured ( hope not) in future then play Kelleher instead of Adrian
SO WHEN SALAH DOESN'T SCORE OR PLAY THE MATCH YOU UPLOAD THE HIGHLIGHTS VERY EARLY BUT WHEN HE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE AS USUAL YOU KEEP UPLOADING IT LATE YOU RACISTS
南野はやっぱこういう時に決めてくれる❗️
Amazing
Alhamdulillah...YNWA.
Power lah... What a comeback... 💪💪
Jota Melhor Jogador Vamoss Diogo Jota
😍😻😻👍🏾👍🏾
Greeting from Indonesian 🇮🇩 sukses selalu
Vardy......
🐐🐐🐐
90 minutes of Anfield terror.. we've build for the moment like these kopites
Never play Koumetio again.He and Rhys always same.Slow and useless.Better bring back Davies than must play him.
Minamino scoring in the last minute doesn't get him off the hook, to many mistakes and rarely shows up when given the opportunity, sell him and save the wages.
Liverpool ❤️
เป็นไงล่ะไอ้เวรถ่วงเวลานักเล่นบอลขี้ขลาด
Booom
What a team , what an Anfield  , just on fire 💥🔥
Well done boy💪 Love From Malaysia♥️🇲🇾
Klopp please stop playing with our emotions. Today we're so lucky, but remember every day isn't friday!
3rd team vs 1st team.
Another come back 🥵🔥😇
khelleher is the man of the match, isn't it?
What a comeback... But I don't know why chamberlain shoot every ball reach to him 🤔
🖒
what a game
if cheering could win u a match. then this is one of them absolutely love it!
At 1-3, I really believe they can get that equaliser and win the game. Boy I was correct 💯
What a game! Supporting Liverpool causes heart problems are.
Only liverpool won't give up on these games klopp didn't care about this trophy look at his reaction all true the game he was cool
Keep in mind we were using PURE bench players against 85%+ Leicester
Why didn't Origi play?  Not even as a sub?
Good game
Best epic comeback
It's time we TRY to win all cup
Thought kelleher was the experienced goalie the way he was composed schmeichel was bobbing side to side like a complete idiot
dafuq is that cup
Liverpool always with emotions
ฤดูกาลนี้ต้องมาซักถ้วยแหละ
What a game What a comeback What a win YNWA
no Salah, no Mane, no Trent, no Van Djik no problem
BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD! YNWA LOVE FROM AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺
Keberuntungan Liverpool belum pudar,, Leicester city buat kesalahan di lini belakang...
liverpool champion
For second goal, how can a 34 year old Vardy overrun tsimikas, that's a concern for d left back
Branden rogers whattt the front door 🤬
Mentality monsters! YNWA ❤️
At 90mins I was still saying to my wife, we are gonna make it 3. And o yes we did! The pass from Milner though for the 3rd🥂 kept floating in the air like it had Taki’s name on it
Leicester ngelawak hahaha
Loved it. What a match! Leicester thought they had done it, started to waste time and all that...but...go home empty handed. We were awesome I. The second half with some of our big guns. The crowd were bloody AWESOME! WOW.
Minamino had his best match in the Liverpool jersey amazing performance
Brilliant boys!
Mentality champions
Liverpool again when they think it's over, when they think we can never , oh boy never mind them , bcoz taki is there, Trent is there and origi there too.
Just like vs Arsenal
I would love us to win this trophy!! Plz play a string team vs arsenal!! This will make there season beating us
Great comeback 💪
God job Liverpool 👏👏👏👏❤️
Salute for leicester, your class is big five in premier
Сууукаааа...
taki and ox and jota superb
Anda sehat bung!! Senam jantung selalu ada..!!wow
You could have that Keita´s penalty once in slow motion replay from behind the shooter -angle, it was so top corner as you can safely put it! Kelleher´s second save wasn´t easy, usually that kind of shot goes to goal just under the keeper´s ribs.
YNWA from Thai
You already know what it’s gonna be like when we play against Leicester in EPL
The comeback kings strike again.🥇⚽🥅🎆 Jota player of the season.
Liverpool DNA
Minamino 🔥🔥🔥
Can liverpool improve Kelleher's contract? The man deserves way more than what his current paycheck is, it's ridiculous. Make him our second choice already.
De javu.. The moment when champion league againts AC milan😃
MINAMINO 🔥🔥  so happy for Taki
Taki is carabao Messi.
Diagne all  > Minamino +1
Never give up till the end 🇮🇩
Winner mentality 💪 great job boys🔥
南野の同点ゴールで最高潮になりpkを外す南野らしいけど勝ててよかったww   ナイス南野！👏👍
Klopp proved it.. they can still win the game with the youth.. even it was a tough game..
We need a minamino all angles everywhere please admin 👨‍💼
Takumi Minamino is the goat of the energy drink cup
What a match, absolutely breathtaking. Never write them off! YNWA
🔥🔥🔥
Kelleher performance save Taki mentality...  Great substitution from Jurgen...
"jota" He is our goal scoring hero he is
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Kelleher from zero to hero
Nice job
Good job minamino
wooww... amazing
Leicester fans were disgraceful tonight, so glad Jota gave it to them at the end when he scored the decisive penalty.
What a great lads. Always dramatic games
We should note that this victory is by Liverpool B Team vs Leicester. The depth of the squad.
Semoga  jadi  gelar  koleksi  d musim  ini
super... as always... defense needs improvement for sure
Jota
Joe Gomez and Koumetio played poorly tonight. I hope they learn the lesson and improve.  Anyway, what a match! great mentality from all of them. Hope we could hammer Arsenal later in the semi final match.
LIVERPOOL THAILAND *-*
Man ox is so good
come on editor, you can't just cut kostas's dirty skillz on that 1st goal
I'd like to not see Billy Koumetio again for the remainder of the season. awful.. almost cost us the game
Aamiin ALHAMDULILLAH  29000  ALLAHUMMA SHOLI ALA SAYYIDINA MUHAMMAD WAA ALI SAYYIDINA MUHAMMAD 💚💚💚 BERKAT SHOLAWAT QABUUL HAJAT DUNIA AKHIRAT AAMIIN BI QABUUL 🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤗
Although Taki failed PK his performance is awesome.(1 goal 1 assist
Minamino is such a bad penalty takers, shouldnt choose him again for penalty shootout in the future or it can cause us a title
Aamiin ALHAMDULILLAH  29000  ALLAHUMMA SHOLI ALA SAYYIDINA MUHAMMAD WAA ALI SAYYIDINA MUHAMMAD 💚💚💚 BERKAT SHOLAWAT QABUUL HAJAT DUNIA AKHIRAT AAMIIN BI QABUUL 🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤗
Joe Gomez is a good defender....for the opposing team
Thanks for all your efforts.
Win liverpool 😭
Minamino is always prepare the game.We Should admit it！
So easy, we didn’t need Origi this time😎
A typical Brendan Rodgers team, no spine to hold onto leads 🤷🏽‍♂️
Legit breathtaking
Another great night at anfield. What a remarkable show of mentality once again and not even the strongest team playing. We were poor defensively and gave the ball away. I wouldn't have been surprised or too disappointed (considering the CL and PL) if we had gone out especially after going 3 1 down but it looks like these guys want to win the lot this season. Fantastic! YNWA
Itu diaaaaaa...never write off Lfc . Anfield Mari....
Simplesmente LIVERPOOL...
How many clubs have TWO first teams? YNWA🍁
Liverdog
every time Taki scores it put lots of smiles on my face. great match the Kop and the Foxes
When Takumi makes goal, that will be a great day.
King Of Comeback
Goodjob boys
This team❤️❤️
Jota taunting the fans 🤣🤣
โกงความตายอีกแล้วนะบอส
REALLY REALLY SUPER COMBACK
Proud to this team...
Super.... ❤️❤️❤️
Liverpool ❤️
When goalkeepers are beginner level in fifa
Liverpool loves to comeback into a 3-3 score and ended up winning the pens
This game nearly stopped my heartbeat 💗, what a game and what a comeback.. fans are also so supportive and here I am watching at my phone… love Liverpool, it’s truly “ You will never walk alone” …. 🥳
🔥 This is Liverpool 🔥
🔴❤️
Excellent
my heart was in my mouth the whole second half until the last penalty taken by none other than Jota... Minamino played exceptionally well, maybe he should play for the main squad more often.
Comeback spesialis
What and dramatic match
Kelleher 💪🔥🔥
Proud of you Liverpool❤❤❤🤗🤗🤗
Where allison
Imagine us not playing our first team and them playing all of there's and still winning 😂😭😭it was a scare match but through the grace of God we did it
Liverpool GK❤❤❤❤
ggwp reds!!
good game, very good momentum
OX is back in business again
I REMEMBER A MIRACLE OF ISTANBUL AGAIN
It doesn't matter who is in Liverpool's lineup
Drama
3 things certain in life: death, taxes, and taki scoring in carabao cup match
What a comeback  no one expected this comeback neva underestimate the reds🔥🔥🔥🔥🛡
สำรองสู้เค้าไม่ได้เลย.
i love this BIG team, the Anfield really gave the lads some spirits
Let's get it Liverpool!❤YNWA
firminominaminojotaa. like rap👍
สุดยอดเด้้กๆๆ
i dont understand why klopp choose jogom over nat phlips
اتفابلون النصر ي ليفربول
minamino is crazy
I was sleeping when i checked the scoreboard.. It was 1-3 Then im going back to sleep believing they will make a comeback, and yes they did 😂
What do you guys think about Minamino?
Heart attack to watch this.. YNWA
It's like they turn to champions league's semi final. What an atmosphere. Incredible.
Schmiechel’s sour and surly antics and ‘mind games’ during penalties, and him then getting repeatedly buried, is great to watch.
I love this team, club and city. And especially the manager! What a man ❤️
Good luck with your new venture
Go Liverpool
👇Who else thought we needed black Jesus (Origi) to save us?
Where r rest of the player's
Que jogo foi esse sensacional, vai ficar na história principal para goleiro hoje ...isso é o liverpool até fim do jogo lutando...isso é um time de coração 👏👏👏👍👍
i love you liverpool
The way jota mock away supporter 🤣🤣
Diogoal Jota was every Liverpool fan right at the end celebrating in front of those dreadful Leicester fans. Get in Reds!
Final nya sama siapa nih??
Good game from LFC team.... YNWA
This team has both heart and skill! Keep chasing the title! 🔥
Paint it red!!!
This team just doesn’t give up. I love that about Liverpool. YNWA ❤️
Best football club ever
Da werden für die Meisterschaft Punkte liegen gelassen. Wird knapp.
Mental juara🔥🔥🔥
I think the most important change Klopp did for the team was fixing the mentality. In Brendan Rodgers era Liverpool was strong, but not mentally strong to reverse a game 2 goals behind. This Liverpool could be losing by tons of goals, but they would never give up the Heavy Metal intensity of their awesome style.
These anfield comebacks are amazing Extremely good performance from the boys especially chamberlain and Keita when he came on We love this team  YNWA❤️
Minamino 1 assist 1 goal never mind he missed pinalty
Halland Halland La la la la 🎶
Kelleher is really talented especailly in penalty....
Well done boys I go crazy in this game 🔴🔴🙏 YNWA 🔴🔴
Heros ❤
Well done guys! So proud of you! You are now in the semi vs Arsenal. You can do it again( It's time to let the young lads show off and get more experience) YNWA!
Get in reds!  Thoughts on this?  And I like it I like I like it I like it la la la la la la here we gooooo Trent and Andy Robertson🎶
I fucken love yhu liverpool iwas born afan and always be 1 thank you ones boys
Anfield atmosphere hits different; the crowd flicked a switch today & Leicester crumbled. Merry Christmas Reds! ❤️🎄
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
you  will never walk alone;
Come back King's liverpool ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
What a time to be RED  yNwA
Good LFC, next Arsenal vs LFC
Congratulations ☺
And we are doing this lads with essentially our second team. YNWA
Never put Gomez beside Billy in CB  again....so so terrible... in 2nd half, Jota Keita n Konate had save us ...Both of Mino also brilliant tonite
This is Anfield.....This is Liverpool FC...
THANK YOU JESUS FOR THIS AMAZING VICTORY. ALMIGHTY GOD IS INDEED THE GREATEST! HALLELUJAH ALL GLORY BE TO ALMIGHTY GOD
Mu and Everton 2nil down first half all leave stadium And lose 🏟️ liverpool  2nil down first half fans still give support and boom 💥 never give up liverpool win the spirit of anfield 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Always liverpool ❤️ you will never walk alone 🔥

minamino!!!!!!....
What a football club!!  I’m afraid I will end up having heart attack  Liverpool always do it in the toughest way 😂😂😂😂 Anfield today was glowing 🔥
Leicester paid the price for time wasting.
No mo salah today  ?
Gg
I still can't believe we won this game watch the first half alone n was like wayzzz
we go for quadruple now....time to take carabao and fa cup seriously as well
takiiiiiii!!!!!
neco williams🤢🤮🤮🤮
Where's the main players?
Disapointed one more, Man City will be pass in Premier league. Don't let they do that.
Love Schmeichel getting smashed
Do not turn off your tv at 60 minutes 😭😭😭😭😭
This is Liverpool...♥️
THE BEST EVER 🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥
JOE GOMEZ MUST PAID & LEARN HIS MISTAKES.THIS GUY PLAYED SO BAD FOR SURE.JUST SELL HIM THIS JANUARY PLEASE
Y.N.W.A ❤
Minamino almost good
If minamino form continues to final, he should be name carabao cup MVP ..
Moment of silence for those who missed this game.Taki you will always be a legend in this game. Jota what a signing and Kelleher Thank you. Second half was brilliant the subtitutes changed the game. Anfield played a role in this ❤️What a time to be a RED. Always trust in Klopp❤️
Best keeper in the world, Kelleher!
Takumi minamino = isagi yoichi. Source: Blue Lock
Was a pleasure to be there for this game for the first time since 2019 💪🔴
Bill Shankly  “I want to build a team that's invincible, so that they have to send a team from bloody Mars to beat us!” “
Awwwww pity Leicester lmao , congrats Pool once again 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
minamino♡
This game is giving me Arsenal 5-5 vibes🤯
よくやった！南野！ Congratulations Minamino！
This is deep "dude"
Made in  Japan. PK is harakiri.
4 carabao ties, this one is the most exciting. Pool fan since the 80s, this is why i like my team. Never a dull moment. This match is all on taki and kelleher.
Ox is insane❤️❤️
Liverpool won 🔥🔥👍👍
This is Anfield, there is always a will to win for this team when at home. Love the Reds🔥❤️
Rodgers knew after 2 nd goal of vardy that he won until he was told he confused a bus that is going to anfield and not king power
Everton 2-0 down at home after 20 minutes, fans leave, they go on to lose 4-1. Liverpool 2-0 at home after 20 minutes, fans stay, produce the best atmosphere of the season, inspire the team to an epic comeback victory
We so lucky konate and jota in on the second half,   Takumi, firmino and chambo is perfect balance performance. Kelleher was amazinggg,
Algo
Oxlade Chamberlain is World Class! He never gave up and was full of passion
mantul
Jota is really consistent in performance 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I am so in love with lfc can't live without you YNWA
What a game
Yes We Qualify Semifinals Carabao Cup 2021-22 A Very Difficult Match Compiled Vs Leiceter City A Rival Who Had His Occasions But With Faith And Tranquility We Could Get The Game Forward Now Thinking About The Next Match Sunday Vs Leeds Utd At 12.30 PM I Feel Proud Of Being a Fan Best England Team in the World I'm a Number 1 Fan My Team Liverpool FC 🇬🇧❤️ 🇨🇴🇬🇧🇬🇧
3-3, penalties, we know the rest
Wowwwww Liverpool, you're amazing
Taki , Kelle , and good substitutions from Klopp
anfield magic 💪 happy christmas redmen
Comeback is real, this is anfield
Awesome performance from a relatively young, inexperienced team. But I have to say that Anfield was absolutely magnificent tonight. This is what Anfield is supposed to be like every game. This is what Anfield is like when it’s not full of corporate and tourists more interested in selfies and “watching” the game through their phones. Good job crowd, you dragged us through tonight. YNWA.
BVB fan 💛🖤 Good LFC ❤🤍
هل كان يورغن كلوب غير مهتم بهاذا المسابقة اللعب بالشباب مثل ماكان في العام الفائت لكن لابدا من القتال على كافة الالقاب كأس الرابطة والبريميرليغ ودوري أبطال أوروبا
Get the best....
This was the most insane game I think I have seen for the entire time I’ve followed Liverpool (thank you for indoctrinating me dad). And the circumstances before the game makes it even more incredible. Realisticly it wasnt the most important game of the season but I felt like I was watching a Champions League final. This night will be an iconic one in the clubs history.
What a comeback
The goal from Madison was Fantastic. What a great come back from the Lads. I love the team, I love Klopp, I love Liverpool.
What a comeback! YNWA
YNWA
You will never seen a team like this. 3-1 down, win you say? We're used to it Beaten by milan by 3 Goals Barca 3-0 Porto Arsenal Bayern . . We're combacks king, we'll win.  YNWA.
Kelleher is so underrated bro
Minaminooooooooo
Leicester, imagine so much happiness during the goals and so much hopes just to get smacked into the face
Way to go lads 🙏

TAKUMI MINAMINO !!!!

マディソンえぐ
Can we get a camera angle of our first 11 or others that are not playing even if they are at home resting i want to see their reaction when our b team go out and keep up their reputation!!!
Alhamdulila ..I was so happy and I'm still happy.. I love my club ,I love Liverpool, I'm Liverpool ..I never wake alone 🥰😍❤️
Minamino, Jota and Kelleher, legends.
❤️🕊
Good job despite we need PK to win.  Kelleher brilliantly save the pen twice, well deserved 2nd choice GK.   and Carabao Cup is officially Taki's favorite competition now lol.
What a game
WE ARE LIVERPOOL ❤️❤️💪🏼💪🏼

Almost handed them the game, some of the young boys weren't up to the task but good substitutions and hard work brought us back in. Kelleher's performance was epic.
