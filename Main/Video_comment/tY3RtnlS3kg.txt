God damn Mongorians. Tear down chiti wall
You should try Moo Ka Ta in BKK
Stephen Yan is the other famous tv chef
Bro just kissed with the sesame oil.
Yuuum. I love Northern Chinese food!
I tried that now it was an amazing dish
Yan Can Cook was one of my favorites growing up in '80s LA. With that, can you find a way to do an episode with Iron Chef Sakai and base it around the time he went back home and met up with a childhood school friend. It was the best and most sincere intro to any or the original Iron Chef episodes.
i remember watching this show.
Childhood in the 80's? I thought Nigel was my age..... Ohhh Uncle Roger is gen X. Fuyioh!!!!! 😂😂😂
hello im  mongolian and by the looks of it i will accept this video
East China is best China.
duck whit pancake?? that just seems abit weird to me :P
Is Martin Yan related to Stephen Yan?
Yeah, but before corn arrived in China from the Americas(1500s), what was the ingredient in Chinese cuisine that was used like Corn Starch???
Im Mongolian ❤
Martin Yan and Jacques Pépin collaborated a lot in the 80s. The TV nearly exploded with knife skills and flavor.
He used to have a restaurant in a city by a body of water called M.Y. China. Any time I had to go up there it was the only restaurant I wanted to eat. So good.
LOL Japanese porn joke.
Uncle Roger knows also "Live action one piece is bu**s**t" just a hype. Fuiiyoouu Nice!
I have been wanting to try peaking duck but we aint got asin stoor or any asin restaurant around duluth mn
once again asian ppl smothering good food with salt and soysoce, disgusting. fck im glad im european, dont have to eat this shit
I watched Yan Can Cook all the time as a kid. Martin Yan is a legend.
What about Wok With Yan? Best Canadian cooking show EVER! #ChineseWonderPowder
Martin Yan is a true master chef
I didn't realize two 80's Asian cooking shows were both hosted by different dudes named yan. "Wok with Yan" was better tho because of his pun aprons.
Martin Yan and Tommy Tang I remember watching on PBS as a kid
i started watching cooking shows in the 80's and Martin Yan was my fav....i miss those simple times.
I still have a Martin Yan cleaver my dad bought 1985 or so at the Santa  Clara County Fair.   Needs a sharpen, but I still use it.
Yan Can Cook was one of my FAVORITE shows as a kid. PBS FTW 🙌
God i remember yan can cook!!! Pbs my childhood!
loved this show... forgot about ti honestly
taiwan not real country, resubbed
I loved Martin Yan on PBS when I was 8, even though I wasn't allowed to use the kitchen, I didn't even care about the food... I just liked Martin Yan.
I hope the Taiwan comment was not serious
This man was a legend, I loved watching him as a kid!
This is classic 😂
When I was a kid my grandparents would watch cooking shows on PBS and Martin Yan was on, he was very funny, a delight to watch before the days of lively Food Network chefs. ❤
Martin Yan was a staple of my weekends growing up, he was on PBS in the afternoon and I always looked forward to it. If Yan can cook, so can you!
I love Martin Yan
Yan can Cook your uncle 😮😮😮
Grew up watching Yan's show! Looked forward to it every time!
I remember watching this show 😊
Uncle Yan has always been one of the greats
I grew up watching the show in Canada back in the 80s. I loved everything about it and his cooking and his style not to mention how fast he cut up a chicken. I can see eating chillies or hot peppers in small amounts, but the idea of having to eat any part of the most disgusting vegetable on earth, the bell pepper Terrifies me to this day. Long live uncle Roger and your channel, but banishment to the lowest regions of hell with the evil vegetable bell pepper.🤮
Martin Yan the OG. 👍👍👍👍👍
If Yan can cook, so can YOU!
Peking Duck is delicious because all tacos are delicious. Tacos are universal.
Woooooow sold out w these in video commercials
150 to 200 dollars US for peeking duck, no way I’m better off learning how do do it myself. It’s probably double the price here in Canada a months rent for a shitty cockroach infested apartment is 2500 dollars a month I have no choice I have to learn to cook it myself because I will never try it otherwise. You said it inflation IS bullshit!
Yan and Justin Wilson got me into cooking when I was a kid. I still watch their old shows on YouTube. Good dudes.
I got a Yan can cook cookbook from my parents
We had his vhs tapes. Yen, Pepin, and my Mom are the reason I love cooking so much
Come on Uncle Rodger this was the 80s you can say Mongolian beef was from Mongolia and nobody can fact check you
I’ve met Martin yan before.. he is truly a wonderful person and so humble.
Why is Uncle Rodger sweating buckets man, its disgusting to see, you are rich man, fix your ac or get a portable one, nobody   wanna see you all sweaty in video.
When I was young, I watched re-runs of this, back then there was no cooking shows like this. No food on tv like this. I was so excited when it would come on tv.
I remember Martin Yan and his cooking in San Francisco. He was funny on TV but a vary serious chef in person. If you were lucky enough to go to one of his classes it was an amazing experience.
There was a Canadian show called Wok with Yan, whose chef was Stephen Yan, who trained Martin Yan of Yan Can Cook
Grew up watching him (KQED was local to me), loved watching him!
Uncle Roger!!! I really do appreciate you and your videos and all of the things that you have done and experienced and you continue to do to for you and your family and for all of us who get to see you and watching and enjoying your life and hilarious 😂 videos that you do. Hopefully 🙏 one day you will be able to come to Calgary Alberta Canada 🇨🇦 and doing some work here and a few comedy shows that I will definitely be attending to see you my friend
Yan Can Cook was one of the two guys i loved watching cook.  The other was Justin Wilson cooking cajun food lol.
I love how Uncle Roger breaks character at the end.
This video brought to you by ExpressVPN and the CCP. ;)
I learned alot from Martin Yan in the 80s his show came on at 4:30 I loved watching him more than after school cartoons
Very fond memories of his cooking show! “If Yan can cook, so can you”.
Wok with Yan
Yan Can Cook, So Can YOU! I took it to heart and learned how to cook outside my culture. He was much more entertaining than any other chef on TV. I wonder what he thinks of modern cooking shows?
i remember having a low key crush on him in my teens....and he is still a cutie even in his older age
4:20 That sound of chopping is the extension of his Cantonese accent.
Chef Yan really can cook!  I remember watching him in the 80's and 90's and thinking that I have to try that.
Bums me out so much I didn't discover Yan can Cook until like a few years ago. Dude's amazing, not just his cooking (and freaking cleaver skills!), but he's an amazing host and just has such a great attitude.
You wanna know a way to get everything to sail the seas
I'd rather see Tilly Ramsay get a show than Oliver's son.  Why do some also add baking soda with the cornstarch?
The real OG was Wok with Yan (Stephan Yan from Vancouver), Yank Can Cook (Martin Yan) is just the US spinoff of the Canadian original
FUCK YEAH! grew up watching Martin Yan. the man got me stoked on cooking at 10 years old  edit: that Japanese blooper killed me lol
Yan is truly one of the best celebrity chefs out there!!
Social credit score 😂😂😂😂 ... ruined by watching Parasite
I watched Yan can cook when i was SUPER young!! I LOVED it!!🤗🤗💪💪😎😎
This guy was great!  He was part of the reason cooking shows became popular.
Taiwan even not real country 😂😂
Yan fuck up on the cellophane noodle.  Oil wasn't hot enough.
Uncle Roger. Save india from some new niece and nephews who fry and cook with water instead of oil haiyaaaaaa.
just two word art ger this channel has every mongolian dish we eat every day if you wanna see mongolian dish just visit that channel uncle roger should see that boodog this dish is not mongolian that shit is some Chinese seasoning beef bullshit 😂 you know haha
Hoisin sauce has sugar, bad uncle Roger, no more sugar. MSG better.
6:32 “e621” hmmm…
My Dad and I used to watch and cook  Yan's food. Yan can Cook brings a lot of memories back.
Can we still use vpn to view all those mentioned platforms without having a purchased account ?? Isnt using express VPN is just an extra expanse?? 🤔
Martin Yan is the Mr. Rogers of Asian cooking.
A local restraint makes amazing Mongolian beef. It is really spicy they add a chili paste to theirs. The same place makes amazing peeking duck. It is so good and I am not usally a fan of duck.
Martin Yan the 🐐
He was one of my heroes of cooking when I first saw him cook him along with the Galloping Gourmet
if you took the rest of the duck away for other dishes and i paid more than a case of shells for it. Ima want the rest of it. thanks.
His name wasn't Genghis Khan, it was Genghis Khan. George to the people familiar enough
Uncle Roger, will you review Iron Chef Japan? It’s my favorite show
6:32 Didn’t expect to see E621 here 😏😏😏😏
This guy feels like the bob ross of cooking and im here for it
Yan taught me how to carve up a chicken
Why you show me picture of my ex wife 😂
Martin Yan is the real deal. That's when cooking shows were at it's best. Julia, Jacques, graham kerr. wow. so many good ones.
8:09 ahh why u show me picture of my ex wife 😭🙏
I love your critique videos. I’ve probably watched them all. But throwing in videos like this every once in a while is very fun as well.
When I ate Peiking Duck, it was circa 2003, they called it Beijing Duck!  They served me the duck-head and made me eat the brain.....where is your duck-head?
Yan Can Cook and The Urban Peasant taught me to cook!  I got so good I had to go to Beijing and Shanghai and Xi'an to taste real Chinese food!  I think Xi'an cooks the best!
yan can cook and wok with yan is my childhood heroes
wtf, how old is he??, the 80s where 40 years ago,
Im from Mongolia and uncle Yan did good( we didnt say genghis khan we say chingis haan)
7:57 - 8:12 best Uncle Roger quote EVER!
I personally could never eat a duck. I love them too much as animals. They're funny and sweet and they follow you around in a single file.
I said that because I want Japan to be in your side more again Viet Nam is still your brother what if Vietnam is also part of your kind don’t let them treat our kind like that
Playing it safe 1:09
First uncle roger happy 😂
Man why did you put it as mongolian food when you say its not mongolian?
And if Yan can cook, so can you!
Come on man…
OH MY GOD!!! Thank you so much for telling people that MONGOLIAN BEEF isn't actually from MONGOLIA! I've been telling people for years now that dish isn't from my homeland. Mongolia doesn't even have any of those seasonings! Here in -40c we only season our meet with a couple of local herbs, black pepper, and salt!
Taiwan is referenced because various Chinese immigrants settled there and adapted their cooking to the local tastes and ingredients. They created “Mongolian barbecue” (grilling meats and vegetables on large, flat iron griddles). This is an inventive take on stir-frying techniques common in Chinese cuisine. It was then taken to the US.
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook in the UK in the 90s. So entertaining. I sadly couldn't get the ingredients in rural Wales back then. Thankfully, the internet exists now 😋
Uncle Yan using handled wok! Aka, wok for weak men!
My grandmother was one of the first Chinese chefs to appear on American TV, in Seattle back in the 1960s.  Decades later, she attended a presentation by Martin Yan in Hawaii. He did his dish then said he was going to choose someone from the audience to prepare something. He chose my grandmother. Later, she asked him why. He said “you were the only one not taking notes. I figure you must know something.”  In fact, my grandmother grew up in China in a wealthy family and was taught by master chefs in China. She actually didn’t want to learn, thinking she would always have cooks, but her father was involved in politics and could see the growing connection between China and the West. Her mother thought she might wind up living in the West and would need to know how to cook. My grandmother wound up spending about 50 years I America, cooking fantastic Chinese food for all of them.
放调料的顺序不妥
Watched this on local access as a kid . Martin is a legend .
Thats a Duck Taco Mr. Yan!
What happened to your teeth? Do you have dentures?
Stephen Yan is the true OG.
80's white people 😂.
I remember this guy from childhood.
I loved watching yan can cook
When Martin Chan cuts he is sending codes jk lol
how can he change his voice so well omg impressed ❤
Uncle roger:”it includes 37 country including Taiwan” Me:”Taiwan is not a country!”
7:58  LOLOLOLOLOLOL
A year later I watched this again because I love the 80's and miss them still and I miss Yan cooking show, they always do reruns of stupid shit never of epic shit!
when I was a little kid, I used to watch Yan Can Cook with my mom during my nap time.  One of my most favorite childhood memories
Perhaps this is the perfect dish for Minion Jaime to pull that chili jam out of that drawer of doom.😉
Tiny bit. Tiny bit.
What’s OG is wok with yan
Sorry bro I heard your food not good.. put the hawk tuah on it make money dissapear
Love the techniques. Funny😂
"guaranteed what-" HAHAHAHA
If you don't love Uncle Yan we are NOT friends.
12:00 i don't mean to alarm you, but I think there is a seagull in your studio
If you havent already you need to watch wok with yan, the canadian cooking show hosted by stephen yan. No relation to martin yan, but martin had worked under him before starting yan can cook.
Uncle Roger I'm Mongolian in my opinion he make good Mongolian beef
No, Martin Yan is not the first one to do that... there's another chef by the same surname called Stephen Yan and his 'WOK WITH YAN' series...
I remember watching Yan Can Cook back in the 80s. Oh, first comment on an Uncle Roger video. I'm working my way though all of his videos. I want to be a good niece.😉
come back after they finally met
Yaa yaa 😂
Where is Stephen Yan? These all came from Canada but I prefer Stephen Yan.
Of course I remember “If Yan can cook, so can you.” But I also remember—and live by—“hot pan, cold oil, food don’t stick”.
I had such a crush on Martin Yan when I was a kid lol Yan Can Cook was a formative show from my childhood! 🥰
In Denver CO, we get Peking duck for 45 bucks still!
Use Shao Xing wine
Uncle Roger is so bad at cooking.
This was one of my favorite shows to watch growing up 🥰
Check out the Canadian cooking show Wok with Yan. The other Yan.
He taught me how to wok my dog when I was a little kid.
People who all want Uncle Roger for their actual Uncle 👇👇👇👇
Yan Can Cook always legendary! Always a good laugh too.
I grew up watching this guy. Uncle Roger, you should watch some old videos of Justin Wilson, the Cajun cook. "I tell you what I'm gonna did!" I think you'd get a kick out of him.
I’m grew up watching “Wok with Yan” and then “Martin Yan”. I think Wok with Yan was 70s/80s
Martin yan is goated.
Uncle Roger, He replied you that his fried rice is better than you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNFfRcmXS3s
Here because martin ate at uncle roger restaurant
1:04 haiyaaa now both China cancel Uncle Roger.........
Not true on Peking duck. I can walk in most Chinese restaurants and order it. Of course some are good and some aren’t. Avg $40 per duck. Don’t know where the rest of you eat.
He's the childhood of many 80s and early 90s Vietnamese kids. We watched his show with our parents and grandparents while having dinner, never skipped any episodes.
This white boy make this exact dish but I make it better than Yan. I used MSG FUIYO!! #wokandcastironfuckboi
“This is Peking my interest.”…🤣🤣🤣
I love Mongolian beef
I used to love watching Yan Can Cook back in the day, along with Justin Wilson's Louisiana Cookin'
with all the respect, that's not Peking duck at all, its cantonese smoked duck, and the cutting is so wrong from traditional peking duck.
The most incredible thing was that after this, I looked up chef Martin Yan to see if he was still alive. Not only is he still alive, but he’s still doing his show! What a legend.
😂😂 1:48
Martin Yan was one of my first chef show experiences. I loved watching his television show.
Martin Yan not OG  Martin Yan was assistant to Stephen Yan  Martin worked for Steven then made his own cooking show.  Martin copycat Yan. Fake Uncle  Go find Stephen Yan
That man is a god damn legend. That had to be pretty special.
To this day when I cook Asian foods, I hear in my mind, “garlic, mmmmm ginger, mmmm”
After hearing you say Mongolian beef isn’t from Taiwan I had to google it all the results were saying from Taiwan.
"The duck die for nothing". He/she was not cooked properly. Hahaha
The cornstarch seems to immediately gum up my wok. I tried many times to use it but finally gave up. What am I doing wrong?
The first year of uncle martins show he had a really beautiful Asian woman as his assistant but she had an attitude and only lasted a year. I wonder who she was
https://youtu.be/Q_l3ee7QCMg?si=gJ1Iin9knwBW0WHc
https://youtu.be/PTjwTieqhJY?si=8WhCAz4g9kw2rWo7
Cook Yan, inspired me in my childhood to start my favorite hobby: cooking! Good old 80s, "If Yan can cook, so can you! Zai Jian!". Thanks uncle Roger for bringing back good childhood memories...
Yo Uncle Roger finally meet his hero. Not just meet, but also review food together. Now that's dream come true
What about Steven Yan? He is Martin's brother. Had a show called "Wok with Yan"
Hari Merdeka 🇲🇾
react to wok with yan
The bob Ross of cooking
Taiwan not even real country LMAO!!!!!!! Tell em, uncle Roger. Tell em Dubai is also not one LOL
Wok with Yan
Man, this video made me tear up a little. I miss the days of Yan and Justin Wilson😢
You gave me ideas for two extra ingredients for my chicken BBQ the corn starch and msg fu yoooo
I watched this religiously as a kid. One of my favorite cooking shows of all time, up there with the OG Julia show.
Coke heads at 4:21 👀
Martin Yan is one of the few who can strip Roger of his uncle status.
Yan can cook was a staple on PBS, man got me into cooking
I am grateful to my very white father for watching Yan Can Cook on WTTW, Channel 11 in Chicago in the 80s. Martin Yan is an OG and inspired my parents to go eat in Chicago's Chinatown. There should be a monument to Martin Yan somewhere special. <3
Uncle 💖 Rodger big bull s*** artist who is never a little boy it's always been big bull s*** artist
HOL UP! One Piece have no seasons! its all 1 season of 1000+ episodes! like Shin-chan! I'm not really a One Piece fan but who Fucked up the arrangements?!
I love how the sponsorship video is always different Uncle Roger record one each time you make a weejio so i gotta watchit XD
People in the 80s afraid of HIV and MSG? But Uncle Roger, people in the 80s loved their magic white powder!
When I lived in Denver in the mid 90's, I watched his show all the time. He had released a new book, and did a demo and signing at a local bookstore. I wasn't able to make it, as I couldn't get out of work. My mom was able to go though, and got me a signed copy of his book. I learned a ton watching and reading it, and his book was one of my most valued possessions. Sadly, during one of my moves one of my boxes of books was "lost"; all my signed ones. That's the one I miss the most.
Martin Yan was one of my heroes as a kid, too. Unlike so many other people I saw on TV as a kid, I never forgot Martin Yan or his catchprhase: "If Yan can cook, so can you."
C'mon Uncle Roger, you're 51 years old. You weren't a young boy in the  80's .😅
I used to love watching that guys TV show when I was a kid I ever tried to make some of the stuff
Uncle Roger thank you so much for doing this video. I was a kid in the 80's and this was what my Nana and I used to watch. So thank you for the GREAT memories.
I need to arrange a dinner at 大董 for some Peking duck, bring auntie wife along, it's been a while since we had some top notch roast duck.
WOK WITH YAN.  I watching his show when I was a kid.  That’s how I’ve learned to cook
What is peaking man... hahahaha just that bit alone made me cry
love Yan can cook, you can too!!
We have the Canadian equivalent his show was called Wok with Yan. some episodes on YouTube it was a staple show back in the 80's if you stayed home from school sick like the prices is right . Your channel is awesome
MUnGOlian uh-BEEf 6:59
Mr. Yan 🥳Celebrate that man, he’s an OG for real
Very nice. Looks amazing.
Actually that's not Mongolian beef . Because that's too fancy. And all we need is cow meat , salt and little pepper that's all Mongolian people do .
He taught me how to carve a chicken. Love Martin.
If you are ever in Chicago and you like peking duck, go to Sun Wah BBQ.  You get the duck, they take the duck remains and make a duck consumme, they make a duck fried rice, and insanely good crispy duck skin and meat with Duck Sauce.  You get all that in a dinner for two.  It's amazing.  It's not on the regular menu, you need to check if its available.  Best duck I have ever had
I think the hoisin brings the sugar for sure.
“ If Yan can cook, so can you “ !  that was the slogan back then. I hope Uncle Roger can meet up with Mr Martin Yan in a cooking show, it will be so great to watch ❤😊
Went to his class in 90s very impressive.  His friend Roda Yee was great chef too.  Still make her Hanoi Beef Noodle Soup.
My second favorite line from Yan was his "WhooOOAAAah!" lmao  I grew up watching a ton of great cooking shows with my mom, and I've always enjoyed learning new tips and techniques, even if I don't cook as much as I did when I was younger. (#MilliennialMedicalExhaustion) :')
6:44-7:15 I think Uncle Roger was crying here. his eyes and nose were red and puffy and he was drying his face with a handkerchief. bit of lost childhood nostalgia, eh?
oh my god... I used to watch this show as a kid in the 90s. I remember his catchphrase "If yan can cook, so can you". he always ended his show this way. and then as I grew up I looked up his show and I couldn't find it anywhere. I am so glad someone brought him up because, at a certain point, I really thought I made him up. glad to be proven wrong. glad to know someone knows about the "Yan Can Cook" show. he is, and will always be, one of my many childhood nostalgia heroes.
Yan was the best. I used to watch Yan Can Cook, Quick&Easy, and Martin Yan's Chinatowns as a kid. There is so much good content now, but his old videos still hold up. Also, his knife skills, and general hand skills were an inspiration.
Uncle Martin is like Uncle Roger from a parallel universe where everything is a OK.
You can also put baking soda into the meat marination mix, and that'll tenderize the meat even further. What a great dish, which isn't authentically Chinese, but I'm sure would be well received by any from the old country.
Taiwan is real china 🇹🇼
Pretty sure Peking duck doesn’t cost *that* much even in the upscale TST restaurants here in HK. But damn this makes me crave peking duck. Time to hold my craving for 24 hrs 💀 this duck cook slower that Gordon ramsay’s grilled cheese
If I pay for Duck I want the whole damn Duck
He is my hero too. I still chop with a cleaver not a chefs knife
I want to be as confidant and funny as you when I grow up man I'm 25 so hopefully soon XD
If Uncle Roger can cook, so can Niece and Nephew.
How to make uncle roger turned on and relaxed: let him listen to yan chopping with Chinese cleaver
These are my first cooking show memories. Uncle Martin is the reason I love cooking.
Dat duck die for nutthin...
uncle yan is the only one that got uncle title before video even started
uncle roger wasn't even born in the yet in the 80's
I love Martin Yan more than a tiny bit.
Wok With Yan (Stephan Yan) was the original and was much funnier than Martin Yan.
I think Mongolian beef is from Korea originally
I'm 53 I watched this show growing up
Technically he is Grandpa Yan  The legend is 75 years old
Foodgasm! It's foodgasm! Naughty Uncle Roger... sorry children...
" Tossing " means something entirely different on the Australian Continent lol
i miss real cooking shows
Yan is one my culinary heroes alongside Ferran Adria & Jiro Ono
I used to watch him on PBS when I was a kid.  I watched him with my mom.
Uncle Roger trips me out! I'm learning Chinese recipes while getting some great laughs!! Thank you Uncle Roger!!
yes
I met Martin Yan (of Yan can Cook) just this past Friday at the Taste of Asia 2024 festival in Markham, Ontario, Canada, just after our music group performed.  It was awesome getting a photo with him - really down to earth and a wonderful man.  He was really happy when I mentioned that our family used to watch his cooking shows when I was younger in the 80's.
"Inflation is boolshit." True words. I used to watch Yan Can Cook episodes on VHS back in the day.
.Baking soda acts as a meat tenderizer by changing the physical composition of meat fibers. It raises the pH levels on the surface and makes it tougher for the proteins in the meat to bond. Corn starch makes a barrier and traps in moisture to make it tender and helps with overcooking the beef.
“Taiwan not even a real country”😂
Watching him chop, I was always nervous he would chop his fingers.  The man was smooth with the blade.  👍
You know It don't matter, what you want to do?  Don't even matter, whether you  skinny or fat, older or young, black or white, Asian or Amish, Amish or Irish. That doesn't matter. People still make fun of you whether you're any of these things. It's still dope,  doesn't matter.  I mean what do you want to do?  You want to get your Jones sucked off or you want to shovel hay with a fork?  Both is dope.   I'll eat a scorpion I'll eat a jackrabbit don't matter....  You know it don't matter what website you run, I'm just trying to say and you know what else I hope they can hear me AM or FM throughout the Stars you know Andromeda.   You want to know what else I hope they could see me under the sea you know where the shelves shift where you can find a giant squid where you can get enough ink for your ballpoint pen b****.
Yan can cook was my favourite cook. So good so funny my hero too. One of the reasons I cook today make me put both legs on the chair!
I remember in the 80's when I was a kid in Canada my mom would watch this show with a notebook and write down the recipes so she could make them later :)
Growing up seeing Mr Yan on TV was so cool.  Never thought to see a face like my own on TV.  Truly an inspiration to many.
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
I remember watching yan can cook as a child. I forgot how OP Martin Yan was with his knife skills. He was also funny and very entertaining. I loved that show!
Thats one sexy duck! That plating and roll making. Lawd!❤
Should go watch Yan break down a chicken. The guy is a boss.
Even in Australia I remember Yan Can Cook.
I like his newer catchphrase when grating ginger “This is my cocaine.”
You actually believe in social credit ? Lmao you drank the white man kool aid
I live in Beijing at the moment and I frequently eat Peking duck. It is very possible to buy a full  duck with everything you need to make pancakes for $20-$30.
I wonder what Chinese cooks did before cornstarch was a thing. If I remember correctly corn and it's starch were not always available in China.
That 3 course duck meal looked so good 👌
I had the full Peking Duck once. In Peru, were they have a lot of Chinese-Peruvian cuisine. But they have it on the menu, you don't have to order it 24 before. It was really good, specially the 2nd dish (the stir fry)
Yan is the best ❤
A legend, he has a plaque over at Golden West College over at Huntington Beach CA, he is an alumni there.  Found it when I was there wandering around during their weekend swap meets.
Martin Yan is legendary. I used to watch Yan Can Cook back in the day. He helped teach this white midwestern boy how to make good Asian food.
During an Alton Brown livestream, he mentioned Martin Yan, and I commented "Martin Yan rules!" Alton replied, "Martin Yan does rule."
This video is more like early to mid 90s than 80s. You can tell by the clothes and style of kitchen. Unfortunately, people nowadays think any video made before HD is from the 80s.
Food is the great unifier. I can be like, some redneck white dude from alabama. And lets say i meet some chinese dude. And I make him buttermilk fried chicken and grits. And he makes me Yangzhou friend rice with steak in it. And we meet up to have dinner. And now we're good friends because we each brought eachother a delicious dish. That's why it's beautiful. It's like the biblical "breaking bread" or something like that.
Martin Yan is definitely one of my favorite chefs of all time!
Oh my God, this was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid!!
Im from Chile and this show used to be aired on UCV TV and I remember that with 6 years old I learn how to debone a chicken watching this show.
As a kid my grandpa would put PBS on the TV in the background because it had Yan Can Cook playing almost every morning. I would watch Martin Yan while eating breakfast. It was better times.
Can someone tell me what Yan was saying in Morse code when he was chopping the red pepper? It sounded like it was code for something.
Man i remember this guy when i  was a kid. As others have said.  "IF YAN CAN COOK, SO CAN YOU!" Ah yeah.
you can review Yan can cook more would be good Idea
Taiwan dish !!
Love watching Uncle Roger simp on Yan.
Martin Yan is what got me into Chinese cooking. I still have the same cleaver from 30+ years ago. I'm on like my 5th wok
Oh god! I remember this show! Loved watching Yan cook.
The other line Yan would say that I have remember to this day, “AH! Look at this!”
Taiwan is a real country, and will prevail over the corrupt CCP.
Yan also has a YouTube channel! Give him some love! https://www.youtube.com/@ChefMartinYan/
https://www.youtube.com/@ChefMartinYan  Here's the OG Uncle Yan's YT channel!
We all watch uncle Roger to make our credit score go up.
I loved watching Yan Can Cook in the 80s..Lovable guy ❤️
Do a review of Stephen Yan
The social credit score joke was awesome.
Tan can cook , the frugal gourmet and Julia Childs were on channel 13 when I was a kid in the 80s
As a proud Canadian, Wok With Yan was my childhood  Stephen Yan for the win
Yan was my favorite show when I was young. I would watch it on a little black and white tv in my bedroom.
"inflation is bullshit". he's right on the money (pun intended)
no im mongoila i khow my beef boy my beef is the best
Hate to break it to you "Uncle Roger", the OG was Stephen Yan, from the Canadian TV show "Wok With Yan". Martin Yan, no relation, was actually Stephen Yan's employee in the 1980's where he sold cooking products for Stephen Yan.
Martin Yan is to him what Sanjiv Kapoor is to me.
Yan can cook was easily the best cooking show.
Memory unlocked!
Martin Yan may be Uncle, but Stephen Yan is Dad
Say "taiwan is just a Chinese province" and you get more social credit
That's a duck taco lol.
Counting bans from countries like gold medals. All from talking smack. Love it.
Grew up in the Bay Area in the 70's and 80's!!! Martin Yan, Jack Tripper, and Alton Brown are the reasons I became a chef!!!
Uncle roger: pecking duck is hard chef spends 40yrs Mongolians:learning it on random February in their life
when you're actually learning how while watching uncle Roger ✨
Follow Chef Yan here!!! @ChefMartinYan
I loved watching him.
I remember watching Yan Can Cook back in the day.   I'm an old guy,  who learned to cook Chinese food from him.   I still use his recipes. No MSG necessary......sorry Uncle Roger.
😂If yan  can cook you can too
Martin Yan introduced da whyeeT peepole to asian style food.  Used to watch him as a kid (previous millennium) and dream of food with good flavor and texture.  Where I grew up, there was a war on vegetables so they were cooked until they had no texture.
I love this chef! The first cookbook I bought for myself was one of his. I learned how to cook Chinese food from Martin Yan. Loved watching his show too.
"80's White People" 😂
Uncle roger should call martin yan his grand father. Martin been cooking chinese food long long long time ago before he was born.  So taiwan is the country.
I grew up with 'A wok with Yan' this man is a legend.
I loved being able to watch an episode of Yan can cook. Now I have uncle Roger!!
Hai-yaa
Uncle rodger, I grew up with Yan can cook and I would be super stoked to watch a video with you and Martin Yan
Martin Yan (and Julia Child) really inspired me to learn to cook as a kid. Because if Yan can cook, so can you!  Edit to add: it also encouraged me to do so many new things throughout my life, because I really can do anything someone else can, and with practice I can be as good or better at it.
voice transition is Lit💫💥❤
Hermano, that pancake is a tortilla. Notice all the best food cultures have a tortilla. India: Naan. Greece/Middle East: Pita. Italy: Piadina. Ethiopia: Injera. All tortillas. It is the superior food delivery vessel.
i am surprised the editor didn't put an image of a crow at the last screaming bit XD
I grew up watching Stephen Yan (Wok With Yan) and Martin Yan (Yan Can Cook). Fuiyoh!
The dish from Taiwan is Mongolian BBQ, which you pick the meat and veggies yourself and the cook would cook it for you, I don't think it's the one in the video.
Wok with Yan was my favorite show as a kid
Come to Send Noodles in las vegas Chef Mo does Peking Duck
Martin yan can dress a whole chicken in 7 seconds I have witnessed this in person
葱爆牛肉 ”Mongolian Beef‘’ is originally a dish in Taiwan.... er district (for my social score as well) 😂😂😂😂   Ah, fuck my social score, taiwan is a county  ❤❤❤🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼❤❤❤
Ah! why you show a picture of my ex-wife got me rolling to North Korea XD 8:09
Just discovered Uncle Roger and immediately thought to look this combo up. Glad to see he did a Martin Yan video. Now, he just needs to get a Stephen video under his belt and share his thoughts on pun-aprons and Wonder Powder.
Chineses take out beef is softer because of baking soda, not cornstarch young padawan.
I'm from the East Coast our Chinese food over there at least the chicken is way less chewy than the Chinese food in California it's almost like they undercook it over here does anybody have an explanation as to why like literally sometimes I do get pink pieces
Do people from Asia have the same taste?
Love this guy! I learned so much from him.
This guy is a moron.
NO SUGAR!!!! Tastes better
Martin Yan was one of my favorites growing up, and now I have Uncle Roger, who I have often described as "Martin Yan who doesn't have time for your bullshit"
why no "Stephen Yan"? (wok with yan)
“Taiwan not even real country”😭😂
I HAVE WON TON TWO TON THREE TON  I HAVE A LOT OF TONS HERE
He was headed of his time..i remember watching his show at 12 years old...i was always hungry bc we grew up poor..😂😂😂
your next dish make it
Mongolian dishes use horse!
I loved Yan Can Cook.
I watched Yan Can Cook all the time! It inspired my dad, too.
I always watched yan can cook i loved his shows
Who's fried rice is better U.R. or M.Y. would love to see that colab.
He's definitely the GOAT? I used to watch him faithfully 🫶🏽💪🏽
F*cks Given: Uncle Roger - 0 The people of Taiwan -1 Toei Animation -1  80s Caucasians -0
I grew up watching Wok with Yan in Canada before I even cared to cook for myself!  :)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok_with_Yan
I mean, Taiwan is the OG China lol unlike Uncle Roger...not even an OG Chinese 😂
Bro i still remember watching this and i wanted to be a chef.
Thumbs down for knocking Taiwan.🙁
6:24 i Just realized he called him uncle before he got the uncle title
Did he have the show Wok with Yan also?  I remember my mom watching that all the time.
Yan can cook, so can you! 😊
as a kid i didnt appreciate yan enough, what a legend though
If you can do a collaboration with Martin Yan one day, that'd be great.
Fuiyoh! Mongolian Beef is absolutely fancy!  Hi Uncle Roger, I'm Mike from the Philippines. And I'm cooking fried rice, for you!
Wait, china has tortillas ???
I remember when I was young, We used to go to restaurants in China with the same dishes, except it was Beijing roast duck, not Peking duck
I wrote a letter to my local TV network when I was a kid because they took Yan Can Cook off the air.
OMG just saw this video! Grew up watching Martin Yan and has been learning to cook! Thank you uncle Roger for this video
I used to watch his show “Wok with Yan”. I was like 4-5 years old. My Mom thought I was crazy, but it kept me quiet for a half hour.
I am Pretty sure in Canada it was either a different name or different person but there was show called “wok with yan”
I used to love this show. Back when PBS had most of the cooking shows
When eating Chinese beef dish I choose Mongolian, for chicken its General Tsao
Too right on the attention spans of today! Lol.
Omg, Yan Can Cook was THE BEST. I loved that show when I was young.
There was a  canadian version called wok with yan during the 80s. I wonder if they're related
@9:09 - That's a tortilla, yo. Or is it? *Google ensues* I'll be damned. Basically, yeah.
Martin Yan's knife skills were always MLG. He's also why I learned how to properly use a wok.
I learn to chop onion and scallop from uncle yan in 80s. Thankyou uncle yan.😊
I loved his show. I made so many of his recipes after watching.
Uncle Rodger I agree that knife sounds amazing
lol I used to watch Yan can cook back in the 80s as a kid
in chiiina they say this duck can no longer say quack..
not true peking man is just as delicious as peking duck.. for 1 million dollars you can eat a piece..
uncle roger i watch you too much my mom say im gettng too asian and dont like how you turn me into pansexual fuiyoooooh! if i buy a bag of msg i think it the last straw..
Martin Yan was a favorite of mine growing up.
Uncle Martin Yang is always beyond reproach. OG Asian chef....for real.
6:32 hmmm yes,furries in my Mongolian Beef.
Great chef. Love all his dishes.
Wow. This is a good find.
Here is Canada we also had Stephen Yan. Wok with Yan was very good.
我小時侯就是看他學煮飯的
Those white thin noodles are only for decoration. Should eat the beef with rice.
Uncle Roger, you should review some Indian chefs as well.. The OG of them is Sanjeev Kapoor know for Khana khazana and Masterchef India.. For the new generation there are chefs like Ranveer Brar, Ajay Chopra, Kunal Kapoor etc.. You’ll be amazed!
You want OG Yan? Look for Stephen Yan, he was Martin Yan's mentor (no relation) and had his own cooking show in Canada on the CBC in the very early 80's. Now that Yan could cook.
I used to watch Martin Yan all the time. I didn't cook anything he made, I just liked watching. He was kind of exotic at the time.😎
80s cooking shows were so much better.
U should review more OG's!!
I grew up with Yan Can Cook. What an awesome man. So kind and funny and talented. He made cooking look fun and easy. Confidence is such an important part of cooking and he exuded it in the most humble way.
I pause at 1 second. I predict nothing will go wrong, because nobody fucks with Chef Martin Fucking Yan. Dude's the king of the kitchen.  Edit: The cleaver chop was the sound of my childhood. Yan was my favorite show growing up. Nobody has better bladework. Watch him debone a chicken.
I think I heard about "Yan Can Cook" from old SNL episodes but he is still around! I am glad "Uncle Roger" likes him so much and it is for good reason.
Honestly, the bloopers are my favorite part... don't get me wrong, I enjoy the whole weejo, but when you come out of character, it really makes me laugh quite a bit.
At one point I was a delivery driver for (one of) Martin Yans writers. He opened a restaurant in Miami while on hiatus.
I am a retired chef. My career spanned 30 years starting in delis and ending as executive chef and culinary instructor. Martin Yan is the real deal. He inspired me to develop high level knife skills and get a good command of multiple cuisines.
It's funny to me that the right is so afraid of "social credit" (something that doesn't even exist) but we in the west have things like LinkedIn which is basically the same thing lol. You people are so dumb.
can't lie, ik roger a comedian but he is a dumb momo; saying Taiwan isn't a real country is the same thing as saying South and North Korea is the same; Roger is an asshole fuyohhh
I still think nord vpn is better
bros the uncle of all uncles
I loved this show when I was 7, and I still love it, and if I had never watched this show, I would be so bad at cooking. And I'm so happy that u said Mongolian beef because I'm from Mongolia, and that means a lot to me it's not much of a thing to others, but it's big for me because I'm a big fan of u
i thought hoisin sauce goes right after mandarin pancakes not peking duke-
I grew up in the 80s watching Yan can Cook, I loved this guy. I always loved his motto, If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!
mongolian beef is from mongolian cows and i know because im mongolia
“He even sounds like uncle Roger and that’s why he’s the OG”.No man, YOU sound like Martin Yan the real uncle. He’s an OG no matter what he sounds like. This fake ass uncle need to shut it
Lol he's not gonna comment on the Asian guy in the crowd 🤣🤣🤣
Got to meet Mr. Yan once.  Very humble and friendly guy.
I remember watching yan can cook on pbs (US public broadcast) before cooking shows became mainstream. As an Asian adopted by white people it was nice to see food from my side of the world, even though I’m not Chinese, on tv.
It took me a moment to realize that it was Uncle Roger's childhood in the 80s, not Nigel's. for a moment there i was like: no way this dude is almost 50! Sadly, i am and i was a kid in the 80s.
It's so matter of factly and focussed on the cooking. No BS. Love it.
Yan is awesome and so are you uncle Roger. 😁
oh, he doesn't even talk like that in real life. i'm crestfallen
Love you Uncle Roger, but need to let the people know that ExpressVPN is owned by Israeli cybersecurity firm Kape Technologies, who was caught distributing malware and adware, not to mention their links with the Israeli government.
As a Taiwanese person, I prefer the sandwich without the green onion
My Mom was from Poland, both her parents were Nazi-POWs at one point ... They all barely spoke English when they came to the USA and even after decades, my Grandparents had thick Polish accents and my Grandmother would go back and forth from Polish to English and back to Polish in the same conversation - but she LOVED Martin Yan!!!  And so you have a Chinese chef who English isn't his first language, talking and teaching with a Polish woman with English not being her first language, and yet she understood him totally.... I grew up watching Yan Can Cook with her every time I was over there (which was often ) love me some Martin Yan!
I met him like 25-30 years ago and yes he's that cool
If Yan can cook so can you when I was a kid this was one of my favorites shows me and my dad used to watch this all the time together
Please Uncle Rodger, show us the "Quai du "Singapore noodle dish" recipe.....
Too much talking.  Just get to the recipe
The thing that originated from Taiwan is not Mongolian beef, but Mongolian barbecue (蒙古烤肉). It's not a dish but a style of buffet restaurant where customers pick their own ingredients and sauce and give them to the chef to stir fry on a plate.
your hero has his own youtube now https://www.youtube.com/@ChefMartinYan
Its true Mongolian beef is not traditional food in Mongolia
YESSSSSSSSS i LOVE yan can cook!!!! watched it all the time when i was a kid with my grandmother.
Better than Jamie
I used to watch him as a kid, and I had no aspiration for cooking. He was just fun to watch lol
I feel like I've seen this guy, and...I mean come on! His energy is infectious. He's funny, charming, and actually has skill in cooking. I'm gonna have to try and track down his show.
Are the noodles supposed to be crunchy?
Mr.Yan is awesome.  I still review his old shows to this day. PBS back then was great. Mr. Wilson was also a great television chef.  Taiwan is its own country.
I love Martin Yan!!! I used to watch his show on PBS religiously.
Wow! Great memories. Thanks for sharing this!
The wonders of PBS in the 80's, so many programs from around the world. Martin Yan was the first chef I remember watching as a kid, and the food he made was amazing and strange. He started my lifelong love of Asian food whether it be Chinese/Japanese/Thai/Korean, I love all of em.
Oh my childhood 😢😢😢.
Feelin so nostalgic right now. Use to watch Yan with my Nana. Thx uncle Roger!!
What about Ken Hom?
OG Uncle Yan
Uncle Roger sound like crow.
He is the GOAT! Thank you Martin Yan!
Tan Can Cook started with a Canadian show “Wok With Yan” - no relation. This Yan was an intern on that show. Both fantastic.
I used to watch his show all the time growing up. "If Yan can cook, so can you!"
I learned Chinese cooking from Martin Yan back in the 80s. I loved his show. Now I've expanded my horizons, learning from Daddy Lau on Made With Lau.
I can watch Uncle Roger just react to the entire Yan Can Cook series. Martin Yan influenced me to want to cook as a kid.
Man Yan brings me back to my childhood. I watched his show religiously on PBS Sunday afternoons. I feel like Roger’s act and acting accent is based more on Yan than anyone else.
I fell in love with Mongolian beef made by Hong Kong cooks lol It's not sweet but savory and garlicy with yellow onion pieces all served on strange but tasty white puffed rice string things (sorry I don't know what they are called). Delicious! Sadly the restaurant closed as the owner wanted to retire, so now I'm trying to find a similar recipe... Also, I grew up on Yan Can Cook. And there is no way you are my age, young man lol OH! And Yan still cooks and I've seen a more recent show, so maaaaybe you could be a guest on his show
I learned how to cook from watching Yan can cook. If Yan can cook. So can you. 😁👍
I live in New Zealand and can remember watching his shows (and we only had 3 channels back then) nice memories
I miss 80’s tv shows. You actually watched them.
Genghis khan lived so long ago, he wouldn’t have known what chilis were because Columbus hadn’t landed in the Americas yet
I used to love watching his show as a kid. His jokes were on point.
Msg wtf this is junk food
This video made me cry. So beautiful. Everything else is ugly except this.
I loved Martin Yan❤.  I was a kid too😅  I'll still watch it if it pops on.   Good ol days😢
My sister and I loooooooved watching "Yan Can Cook" growing up!
I watched "Wok with Yan" in the 80s when I was a kid!
If Yan can fight , uncle Roger can run.
My moms calming noise is chainsaw sounds
Peking duck at Quanjude is amazing!
Genghis Khan, mass murderer and beef dish.
I hope Uncle Roger gets a chance to meet Uncle Yan. Loved his 80's PBS show.
You ain't seen knife skills until you've seen Martin Yan debone a chicken in under 20 seconds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7m4XAVmFFI
Martin Yan, the OG Uncle
Roger need towel to wipe his face in his midst of comments. Is this his style? Is time come across him but not Yan.  He is indeed positive  and has his niche of American  fans!
I worked at a PBS station in the 90s in college. We showed Yan Can Cook. One of the best cooking shows ever. How can you not love Uncle Martin?
I remember in Canada the show was called “Wok with Yan”. Watched it as a kid in the 80’s
Ginger beef was also invented in calgary along with ceasers fyi kids
Show with og would be epic
I love ya uncle Roger but you don't talk about goose. Only duck, I understand if you don't want to tell the people but wow! Goose trumps duck always! Fuuuuyuuuu.
Little did we know, nearly 40 years ago, Martin Yan was going to reveal what Uncle Rogers ex- wife was going to look like.
Martin Yan is one of the people i watched as a kid that made me love cooking. I remember watching him and hearing. "Remember if Yan can cook, So can YOU!"
northern part of china?
Brought back my childhood hero chef ❤  His cutting skills are still unmatched
“You hear sizzling, i hear my ancestors exciting”
Oh that picture of the ex wife was funny
this OG is the reason i became a cook
Love Martin Yan! He is a master
Hong Kong duck tacos. I'm updating my menu!
I stop watching when you said taiwan is not a real country... i know it was a joke but still thats a realltbad joke. Taiwan is a one beautiful country and you just mock it. Shame on you and your fake accent
If you want a REAL OG Uncle…about a decade before Martin Yan, there was Stephen Yan (no relation). I loved watching reruns of his show Wok with Yan, growing up. He was incredibly entertaining, silly, and always wore aprons with ever changing “wok” puns. I highly recommend checking him out!
I watched him all the time. I prep garlic the same way.
I loved watching his show as a kid. Earlier this year, I found that lot of the episodes are available on YouTube. So much to learn from his techniques.
Yan Can Cook brought so much happiness to this white boy back in the day.  Dude was a master at making Asian cooking accessible.  Plus he was hilarious.  We didn't have cable so this was the next best thing to cartoons.
This channel is so freaking addictive
If "Yan can cook, so can you!"
“Why you show me picture of my ex wife?!” 💀💀💀💀
Martin Yan is the OG, love him!
No corn starch to thicken at the end to make sauce stick to meat and you say good. Your review skills dropping 😂
Ghengis Khan.... The biggest mass murderer in the history of the Planet.
Never insult Yan Can cook. What the hell have you cooked?
He also did Wok with Yan right?
I used to watch this on PBS as a kid. It was on in the 90's, not the 80's.
Yan is the man
Uncle roger can you do video about Dutch/Indonesian Chef Lonny… he made the best Egg fried rice.
The first rice cooker I ever owned was Martin Yan’s old school 1 button rice cooker.
Love yan can cook!! Worked for a chef who learned from him...
White American female here  As a young child like 4yo I would run to the tv and watch very single time Yan can Cook came on. It was one of my favorite shows from a toddler up until a teenager
Martin is the OG!
The bloopers 😂
KQED's YouTube channel is now running episodes of classic Yan Can Cook and posting episodes every Monday. He was one of the first true personalities that drew me into the world of cooking.
I grew up fat watching Wok with Yan
I loved watching him. He’s was the start of my cooking show addiction lol
"flavor enhancer e621" huh... So is that certain image site supposed to be msg adult material?
Uncle (dumbshit) Roger like a lot of people don't watch him because he's a Hack. Martin Yan is the real deal and is great Chef.
What about simply ming? His show was good too
Include TW🇹🇼🤣🤣👍👍
👍
Wouldn’t busy restaurants make a certain number of Peking ducks in anticipation of orders that day?
This is not a review Uncle Roger, quiet Uncle Martin trying to teach you something take your lesson.
Haha including TW
Chili oil? No it should be chili jam
Japanese porn "blooper" at the end LOL thank you for the laff uncle Roger!
Fun fact in my country chinese people say Taiwan part of china but Taiwan people say they country,me and my Hong Kong buds just chilling-
Wait...MSG is called E621?
Any food called “Mongolian” something is not from Mongolians.  Usually it’s based on something or inspired by Chinese people who originally cooked their way out of slaughter by feeding the Mongolian invaders and “domesticating them”.  And thus the Yuan dynasty.
I really appreciate Uncle Roger talking about the real history of Mongolian Beef, but not shitting on the dish itself. Being a Chinese girl from SF, it’s great to see someone not crapping on Chinese American food for not being “real”. 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Mongolian Beef really has nothing to do with Mongolia, but it covers all the greatest chinese techniques of cooking meat.
Mr. Yan is still alive and cooking too!! ❤
Please review more of Martian Yang
stare fry, hhhhhha
It's been so long, I forgot how good this show was.
Martin Yan is a true legend!
I have loved Yan Can Cook on PBS since my childhood!! He is the real OG alright, Uncle Roger, thank you for giving him due respect!!
I loved watching Yan on TV as a kid.
Yan was the man back in the day
Mongorian beef is amazing!!
The man definitely knows how to cook. Asian ppl make the best food in the world I just gotta say it.
Since I was born in the early 1990s, got to know more about Yan himself and his iconic catchphrase growing up even though I was watching reruns of a popular 1980s cooking show here.  Now I can cook, and so can you even if it's for yourself because you don't trust others eating food you make. 😂
Uncle Yan is the Bob Ross of cooking. If he can cook (or paint) so can you!
Yan's knife skills was the one thing I remembered from when my parents watched him. Next level and very entertaining.
Yan Can Cook was the first cooking show i ever watched. Chinese and Thai are my most favorite foods.
When I was a kid the local PBS channel (WTTW 11 Chicago) used to show Yan Can Cook followed by Justin Wilson the Cajun Cook every Saturday. The two of them were both so funny. Still to this day my favorite cooking shows.
There's another OG Yan. He had a show in Canada Wok With Yan. I have no idea whether his cooking is legit or not but I remember his show being entertaining enough to keep the attention of teenage boys that wouldn't be trying to cook like that for at least a decade.  I the other guy was Stephen  Yan. Hes more like you. Goes with much more comedy in his style. I'm pretty sure they are related. Cousins I think.   Now that I see you're a fan of this guy I have a much better idea of what you think is good. As it happens  the local Chinese chefs cook very much like he does.   Also. Jamie Oliver is just terrible. My school food was bad enough. With him in the kitchen? Brutal. Good luck learning with malnutrition and indigestion at the same time.
The first Chinese dish I ever made was Martin Yan’s scallion pancakes back in the 90s.
Come from Taiwan? You mean Taiwan, China? because we all know Taiwan is not a country +15
Yan Can - What the HECK !
There was an afternoon cooking show out of Vancouver, BC in the late 70's-early 80's called Wok With Yan featuring Stephen Yan (who owned several restaurants around Vancouver) that introduced a LOT of people to Asian cooking.  And although they weren't related, Martin Yan and Yan Can Cook sounds like it was very similar, just in a larger market.   Both were fantastic ambassadors for Asian food and also showed that making it at home was not that difficult.  And you know that you've had an impact when it was before the internet but people remember you fondly 40+ years later.
My nana used to watch his show and cook it
So it's you who caused the price of koshihikari to rise *again*? Good going! 🤪😉😉😉
This was actually my first "favorite show" that i ever had. I was born in 1991 and from 2-6 all i wanted to watch was Yan Can Cook. 😂
Loved Yan Can Cook when I was a kid, and probably one of the reasons I love to cook today (I'm 50). Great video!
Do more Martin Yen coverage. Hiyaah
Uncle Yen is Bob Ross of kitchen
Martin Yan is one of my childhood heroes! Number 1 chef!
Sonweird that even Canadians in the comwnts dont know this was a canadian show.
Yan Can Cook is a Chinese oriented cooking show starring Chef Martin Yan that featured recipes for stir fried foods and an assortment of various other traditional Chinese meals and cooking techniques. The series first aired in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (CFAC-TV) in 1978
Dont forget wok with yan!!!
Oh shit yan!!!! Canada represented finally!!!!
I used to rent Yan cooking videos back in the 80s.
kids would stay home sick watch priceis right. i'd watch my guy yan can cook everytime.
"inflation is bullshit" 😂😂😂😂
"Yan can cook, so can you"....... Probably the first cooking show I watched......
What a jerk he's probably not even a chef he just talks s*** all the time
OH MY GOD THANK YOU FOR THIS!! I grew up watching Yan can cook but never met anyone else who did.
Uncle Roger cheap Yan knockoff
My mom and I watched Yan Can Cook religiously in the 80s! I’ve been watching episodes on YouTube recently.
6:33 oh yeah, I know that website
You need to do a video on martin yan's boss "stephen yan" from Canada where he brought the flavor to canadian tv's in the early 80's with his show called "Wok with Yan" the FIRST yan on north American tv ;) Thank you for your time and have a fuiyoh day!
I’m almost 54 years old and uncle Martin is the first cooking show I ever watched. Legend.
i haven't had good mongolian beef in 5 years, i am a hermit and live far from civilization. I make a serviceable one, yet sometimes i want a pro to make it.  Maybe next time i go "to town"
Sry.  You lost all credibility when you started to promote MSG. MSG is a declaration of failure, its used when your real food isnt good and you need to enhance it.  Just learn to cook man, its not hard..
12:35 he sounds like he’s straight out of Banjo Kazooie. 🤔
Wok With Yan: Yan, Stephen
This guy is like the Chinese version of Justin Wilson of The Cajun Cook fame.    Down to earth, personable, likeable, well beloved by his fans, and an excellent cook!
Thanks for bringing back a wholesome legend Uncle Roger.
I can't believe I forgot about Yan can Cook
NINJA PLEASE!! You know damn well that YOU SOUND LIKE MARTIN YAN! HE DOESNT F' IN SOUND LIKE YOU!! You stole... I mean borrowed your style from him.
Yan can cook is the man
Yan inspired my cooking career from watching him in the 80's. He is the OG Boss (Uncle).
The best thing I heard of Martin Yan is that he was awarded the James Beard Life time achievement award in 2022. Many Americans have forgotten about the legend but his peers have not.
I want some of those duck tacos.
You should collab!
OMGOMGOMGOMG..Martin Yan & Uncle Roger together!?!?!? YES PLEASE!!!!
MXR vs UNCLE ROGER ? on taiwan
you should see the espisode to how he did duck with a wok and deep fried it.  amanzing
i use to watch him as a kid.  Canada loved this guy so much that he had a following up here too.  we miss him
Chef Yan is the real OG
Martin Yan is the chinese equivalent of Bob Ross.
If Yan can cook so can you is a memory every genX has.
Loved watching him and Julia Child, Jaques Pepin, all amazing.
Yan is the Bob Ross of Chinese cooking.
I loved his show Wok with Yan.
I love how at 5:05 he continues the joke for the people then quickly switches back to cooking mode; man's a legend ✌🏼
Martin Yan no sound like Uncle Roger, Uncle Roger sound like Martin yan 💯✌🏼👀
I remember growing up watching him and Justin Wilson on PBS with my dad. Still to this day one of my all time favorites.
我爱台湾
I used to watch Yan can cook. He was on here in New Zealand in the 90s :) loved it as a kid
"Guaranteed orgasm" 🤣
I met Martin Yan many years ago.  Really nice guy! I grew up watching his show. OG fo sho!
Yan Can Cook was my first cooking show. I'll never forget it!
Martin: Can you hear the sizzling sound? Uncle Roger: You hear sizzling, I hear my ancestors crying tears of joy fuiyooo!!
Yeah that guy is a OG chef here in Canada and his dad had a cooking show on TV he's the master they still have the restaurants to this day
Wok with chan better
This took me back to those lazy Sundays watching PBS and checking out some OG chefs like Yan, Julia Child, and Nick Stellino! Martin Yan was awesome!!!
This man was basically my babysitter when I was young!
Ayooo his social score just went up such a subtle yet savage joke love it!
I was obsessed with "Yan can cook" and "Wok with Yan" when I was a kid.
Yan can cook!
i like "wok with yan" show
"If Yan can cook so can you" is such an absolute power move after he spent the whole video showing up his audience with knife wok and plating technique.
I miss this guy he was one of the best cooks to watch on television I grew up as a kid watching him taught me a lot about cooking and Chinese food
I love Martin Yan.
Legend has it: Uncle Roger is made of MSG.
I was like 16 years old when Yan came out.  Grew up learning Chinese cooking from him
Me personally, Tai wan no country haiyaa
Martin Yan is also quite popular in the Philippines, but most Filipinos grew up with another Yan...  STEPHEN YAN.  The Chinese-Canadian chef host of Wok With Yan.
I watched Yan as a kid and I really loved it. Like 8 year old with no cooking experience, but martin Yan made me love it.
As a former Vietnamese kid, his show was such a hit here. We barely understand English back then but we all known the phrase "Yan can cook". I dont even remember the content now but still remember his chopping
Taiwan! Represent! Nice one Uncle Roger. We will take that joke as a compliment, bc we rock (and so do ABC descendents like me).
An a entire YouTube comment section that knows about Martin is this a dream?
Roger: "It already got MSG!" MSG: "Flavour Enhancer: E621" .... *Those Who Know*
1:18 when the Chinese visa is coming up for renewal.
So excited for this video! My grandma used to watch him all the time🤣🤣🤣
One of my first and favorite celebrity chefs too. Taught me how to peel an onion and so much more. If Yan can cook, so can you!!
You should do a review on a "Wok with Yan" (Stephen Yan) episode!
tonguegasm
This is the 90s bro
Yan can cook gave me a recipe that I still cook to this day
Lmao 😄😅🤣😂 You  Is using  that social Chinese credit score because he's trying to get that Beijing house!!!!
This chef gives out chef ainsley vibes without the weird part.
I wish I could get Mongolian Beef at Panda Express.
Who watches Disney anymore.
I used to watch this all the time and inspired me to be a chef
social credit up 1, subscriber count minus 1! 🤣
Yan can cook was legendary!
Taiwan not real country 💀💀💀💀💀 bro hasn't gotten canceled after that is wild. Dude is Immortal
Being Canadian I grew up with this show since it was filmed in Vancouver BC. He was awesome.
I remember Yan Can Cook. 6 year old me said, “FUYOH!” in my own way seeing his knife skills. He is like a human food processor when he chops.
it was a good show before cooking shows ran amok. Very entertaining. What is the crap about Taiwan not being a country?
Uncle Roger - you should really check out Stephen Yan's "Wok with Yan" - a Canadian TV show that started in the 70's...he was my first intro to cooking...and great "Dad humour".
I watched Yan Can Cook!!! That show, Graham Kerr, and Frugal Gourmet got me cooking!
This motto should add some words “If yan can cook,so can you,other than Jamie Oliver”
Why U not review Wok with Yan, more OG than OG, Haiyaa...
When he said, “Zai Jian!” At the end. I got a lil nostalgic being raised on 80s TV and of my old Chinese class. Plus the joy he said it in. Just warmed my heart. 💗
My hero too. He taught me to put the Asian in Caucasian
Man, Yan Can Cook. I used to watch that on PBS with my mother. Along with Justin Wilson.
It's amazing that this chef still has his PBS show today at age 74! He's never stopped cooking and inspiring people and that's truly admirable and remarkable. Mad respect
Yan Can Cook was literally my childhood. Thanks for bringing me back 🥰
Marty was good enough to enthral me as a teenager, he had the skills and personality as well.
One piece live action version is worst
I used to love Martin Yan! Just downloaded this video to make this dish 😋
When I was young all the cooking shows were on PBS. It was Julia Child, Galloping Gourmet and Yan Can Cook. Martin was my favorite. I was fascinated by how great he chopped and how funny he was. 25 years later I got to assist Martin for a whole day of cooking demos, and even got to show him how I taught myself how to chop like him with a Chinese cleaver. He gifted me a signature cleaver and I got an autographed Martin Yan cookbook and lots of pics. One of the best days of my cooking career
Used to watch Yan Can Cook on PBS way back when I was a kid!
My favorite show...never missed
That duck looks delicious
I used to love this show, my parents used to watch it all the time, he was a beast with the knife
Luō jié shūshu shì yī míng jiàndié, zúgòu cōngmíng, nénggòu yíngdé rénmen de xìnrèn, ér dāng yī míng chúshī zé ràng tā nénggòu zài gèguó zhī jiān fēixíng
You put the chilli in at the end! My uncle said, that way you dont lose the heat
Mr. Yan was definitely my cooking inspiration. Best cooking show on TV.  So much passion, so many laughs. Love it!
I loved his trip to the tofu factory....
I love wok with yan more.. 😂
Mr Yan taught me that i could cook like him!!!!!
I mean, given YouTube's demonetization policies these days, you might as well get monetized in proper fashion and open with a Japanise porn joke xD
Why when I watch this guy do I have to walk around thinking to myself in his voice?
I mean, baking soda is usually the secret behind extra tender beef, it denatures the proteins.
One of PBS best series.
LOVED Yan Can Cook as a kid. I adored his personality. I saw a clip of him on Masterchef or Hell’s Kitchen or something and I popped.
I have to take a moment to give my respect for Martin Yan. Yan can cook was my number one all time favorite cooking show. It's because of him my kids wonder why I show off with my knife while I cook.
很崩溃，到底是哪里的蒙古人会吃这破beef啊。我们可以吃牛肉干，吃炖牛肉，而且蒙古人更爱羊肉！
Taiwan is not a real country 😂😂  Sorry guys
thank you for introducing me to Uncle Yan
Attempt to get uncle yan love huh ..uncle roger? Wadabout autie easther ..hiyaahh ...😂
The 80's and 90's were lot better than today's society
As an Australian we hate mongol beef with chilli,  Due to race riots in early 1800's in Australia against Chinese people and Chinese food  ,the colonial Australian government released a pamphlet for Chinese cooks  To cook Australian meat an vegetables with Chinese sauces   Australian Chinese food is very different from Chinese mainland style cooking  But mongol beef is a favourite minus the chilli ha ha   As a person who hates most foreign food an prefers anglo Australian food I make an exception for mongol beef ha ha
if Yan can cook... So can you!
Yes love Chinese clever. He is like a comedian and  entertainment chef and cook dam good 😌
Laugh 😹 so much and funnyer when he laughs at his own jokes!! Yea mon! Guud tings!
if yan can cook, so can you!
Stare fry hahaha
6:31 Subtly referencing a furry porn website to describe MSG... odd taste...
Martin Yan was a big part of my childhood, love this tribute to the OG Uncle Martin.
If I had a dollar for every pixel in this video.......I'd still have a dollar.
I'm 46 years old. When I was 7 years old. I used to watch my Mother, Julia child, Martin Yan, Jeff Smith, Jacques Pepin, and Justin Wilson on PBS. I still watch them on YouTube. At the age of 7 I started learning how to cook and now I'm a chef.
I remember Yan’s shows! In fact, my older son really remembers them and is probably why he is the main cook in his family.  I had to send this - one of my Favorite Uncle Roger wideos -  to him.
Grew up watching wok with yan. Edited: genghis ghan like his women (plural) spicy
I loved watching his show..
I love Uncle Yan. Thanks for covering him Uncle Roger! Fuiyoh!
🤣
The nostalgia .... good times! The GOAT
I loved watching this show as a kid. If Yan can cook, so can you!❤
HIs first series on CBC (Canadian TV) was Wok With Yan. My Mom and I never, ever missed a show. Martin Yan was a rock star chef long before the Food Network.
Who was the chef that wore the punny aprons?
I grew up watching this with my dad. Totally forgot about it.
这个老节目真的太有趣了😂谢谢罗杰叔叔❤美好的80.90年代
IF YAN CAN COOK SO CAN YOU... ZAIJIAN
Bloopers: Uncle Roger and his natural white man’s accent 😂
he sounds like uncle roger cause its an act
Be your own best Chef - Fouuuyouuur 😍i spring Oncle Rodger a nice FAN, so he does not have to wipe nasty sweat
I got another one for u uncle, wok with yan.
I hope you get to work together one day man, that would be awesome
Uncle Martin yan
"Inflation is bullshit. Everything more expensive but Uncle Roger salary stay the same." Dude preach
Yan can cook was one of the best shows ever!
I've had the pleasure of watching Martin Yan cook in person. He's even more awesome in person! He's also hilarious. It's almost like watching a comedy team cook where his "partner" is the food.  If you want to see something REALLY hilarious, dig up the episode of "Emerald Live" where Emeril cooks alongside Martin Yan. Yan constantly makes fun of Emeril's (lack of) technique through the whole show.
Where can I get that HIV? I have MSG, so it could be good increase
Chinese restaurants= Mess, coloring meat, gathering oil from sewers :(  No go=bad cooking, bad health, no eat food in china
Martin Yan is my childhood, used to watch his show on TV with my mother, it bring back old good time
It’s softer because of baking soda, not corn starch
I'm Taiwanes, you'r right Taiwan is't a country, it's just the place, that the R.O.C on it.
I watched his show all the time as a kid , if Yan can you can
Serisly Uncle roger is a idiot and can funk off. He acts like a know it all !   I hate his noise. I grew up with uncle Martin Yen and he is awsome! I don't get pised by his voice like I do with uncle Rogger.
祝君早安😅
Dude Taiwan is real country Don't believe ccp 🐂💩 Don't do that again
I remember watching "Yan can cook" as a kid. It was a great show
Bi-carb soda is the secret to tender beef. Uncle Roger hiyaaaa!
Martin & Ming influenced my journey in the culinary arts. One of many styles under my belt.
to be honest to make REAL TRADITIONAL mongolian beef, this is totally different
I've only had peking duck a few times and hard to find in a small Scandinavian country but goddamn it's so good.
8:32 it’s shinier than my future 😢😅
Imma mongolian and yes I eat mongolian beef all the time here in Mongolia. But never seen "mongolian beef" dish in here.  I was traveling in Europe and found that one chinese restaurant had "mongolian beef' dish. Tasty but not any resemblance to mongolian cuisine as uncle roger said.
Martin Yan is my coworkers dad lol
I met Martin Yan when I was young in person and got a signed book from him
To be accurate, Genghis Khan like all women 😂
Coz no living duck trade in Hong Kong since the 1998 chicken flu, no more good duck in Hong Kong anymore, not even $150 can buy one
His show used to be shown on the only %V channel we had in India growing up in the 70s
"Yan can cook" by Martin Yan is really an OG!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Glad to see Uncle Roger bring him back!
Uncle Roger.. if its not Mongolian why do they name it as mongilina beef?? You said it taste pretty good but i believe you need more food expedition 😅..
Uncle Roger, do a reaction video of Chef Stephen Yan of Wok with Yan.
Yes!!!  Chinese Canadian representing. I used to watch this as a kid because we only had 2 channels in Canada.
Anybody noticed the Chinese abacus in the background?
Hey, Uncle Roger. Have you seen the episode of Gordon Ramsay's "Hells Kitchen," where Martin Yan was a guest judge , when the cooks on the show had to make Chinese dishes?
“HI Weeee”
Uncle Rodger I love you but why the fuck are you always sweating in your Loft in London have you no air conditioning sir????  I get that an English summer is almost like a San Francisco winter.... but damn it man they have to sell air conditioners in London
21:21 30/10/2023 Monday
no need for sugar on a beef dish like that.
martin yen sounds kinda like that host of unsolved mysteries robert stack with a foreign accent
Shouldn't cook the sesame oil!
"Genghis Khan... Mongolian... /uh/ Beef" 😂
Why haven’t you updated your WhatsApp channel
Yan is a legend
I loved Yan Can Cook when i was a kid too!
I loved watching Yan Can Cook as a kid.
That social credit score joke had me dying 😂😂😂
The internet has been around since the early 70s, akshually. Its the World Wide Web that was born in the 90s.
support Uncle Roger - Taiwan is not even a country!!!
11:35 this is the scene u pause on, what is he doing with his hand? Reminds me of a certain someone from germany
My first TV chef! I loved Yan Can Cook! (On PBS, if I remember correctly)
Awesome video Uncle Roger keep it up Fuiyoh!
His channel made an update like a month ago with a live you should reach out to him to do a collaboration
Learned rice from him
martin is really a legend u should have him on this channel! u guys should cook together
I grew up loving watching Martin Yan.
Bro, you UK people need central AC in homes.
I still remember Chef Yan teaching efficient, safe knife techniques for Home Cooks to use.
Uncle please do a collab with simply dumpling i wanna see you both cook one day if not
Glad you can find a great amount of the episodes of “Yan can Cook” on YouTube.
i once saw Chef Yan in a resturant sitting nearby and he has a normal accent and not the heavy charlie chan accent he often used playing the Chinese fool (not shown in this video)... as an older ABC I hated how he set us back and pandered to the white expectation for a charlie chan... Sigh... i wanted to punch him in disgust... He didnt have that TV accent...
Bro is getting canceled In Mongolia and Taiwan for the introduction of this video
This show is what made me love cooking, used to watch it as a kid and still watch it on YouTube lol
Taiwan is a country 😐
Taiwan not a real country? Haiyya....that is below the belt, Uncle Roger
Thank god you did this. I love yan
i love martin yan, and he clearly influenced your cooking show style, i love it!
Happy 2 see uncle rogers social credit score going up 😂
Love Mongolian beef but yea it’s not Mongolian at all.
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook and the Frugal Gourmet.  Absolute icon.
I went to a live taping of Yan Can Cook and I made it onto the show here open Toronto ❤️🇨🇦🌎
If Yan can cook and so can you ⛳
A true legend!
FYI, if you can't afford Peking duck, you can also make 3 dishes with Costco roasted chicken
Uncle Roger needed to add to his negative social credit rating.
Btw Japan one peice no subs
I've ate plenty of wild ducks that I shot but only had Peking Duck one time in my life. It was delicious. Simply undescrible fantastic.
I'm Mongolian and this is first time I hear about "Mongolian beef" dish. Have you tried any real Mongolian dishes? I recommend Цуйван (Tsuivan). Best thing about tsuivan is eating left over with Сүүтэй Цай (Suutei Tsai/Milk tea) in next morning.
Uncle Roger used to be young? I kinda thought he just popped out into existence 😮
Never heard of him before this video but I know he must’ve been a great and funny chef and I can see why Uncle Roger likes him a lot.
I love Martin Yan! I have one of his many cookbooks.
8:11 is a straight violation 😂
Martin Yan is the Bob Ross of cooking
In VietNam, nobody know his name is Martin, but everybody call him Yang Can Cook. Just like his real name is Mr. Yan Can Cook
I remember watching Yan Can Cook with my dad growing up. Thanks for the nostalgia!!
I think this show was broadcasted in the Philippines as “Wok with Yan.” And Uncle Roger, is that a Good Morning towel??? 😅
Martin Yan is God-tier chef, and before I watch, I already confident Uncle Roger approve!
Effin ccp sheep
Taiwan is a strong country who definitely isn't afraid of the Chinese
when I heard Peking Man I thought he was going to make a joke about Homo ERECTUS
Who else think that chopping can actually be made into a sick Djent beat🤣🤣
The way he roast  jammie Oliver in every video 😂😂😂
now hold on uncle roger i do believe black people forcibly brought flavor to america. this guy is cool though i just wanna get that straight
I loved that show
He looks like you bro
7:15 I'm surprised he didn't point out the 2 asian guys in the audience who couldn't be bothered to look impressed 😂
I know you're trolling but Taiwan is 10k times more real then the PRC will ever be. It's just a CCP run free for all.
Would he be Grandfather Yen?
can you review wok with yan from the 80s? he always had funny aprons
Martin Yan was so nice when I met him.
Uncle Roger was so scared, he put his leg down 8:08. That's the first time he does that.😮
8:09 😂😂😂
This is the most happiest i have ever seen uncle roger fuiyoh
Yan is classic and so is the show Childhood memories man Is the show still on?
Mr Yan is an example of how Hong Kong was before the CCP took over
Yes Taiwan Province is part of China
https://youtu.be/mLO5GQ14ge4 When Uncle Yan AND Uncle Roger both say that you can't cook Asian food on Hell's Kitchen, you f^*ked up.
Did anyone else hear 'cocaine' oil?
Wondering if this dude is who Sammo based Jackie's character in "Mr Nice Guy" on.
I grew watching him and had the extreme pleasure of cooking for him in my chef career! He's a culinary legend!! FUIYOH!!!
the 80's when nothing was so complicated and legendary shows like this existed😮‍💨
Uncle, you werent even born in the 80's
We need more reviews of Yan can cook.
Growing up in Canada, Martin Yan and The Urban Peasant were what I watched when I wanted to learn to cook. Little 8 year old me would watch him every chance I got. I honestly have to credit him for my love of Asian cuisine.
NOT corn starch that makes it tender,,its baking soda,,uncle rodger screwed up here
I used to watch him on pbs in the moring when i was in high school lol i loved his show
Flavor enhancer HUH?!?!
Martin Yan is one of the all-time great TV chefs.
4:19 so basically every Adam Liaw weejio?
His goodbye in Chinese at the end has a accent, meaning he is from Hong Kong, and in the early 80s, King Kong was still a independent country, so u technically can’t say he is Chinese…
U can visit Beijing and eat Peking duck for less that 30 dollars us
Also Peking duck is from Beijing, it’s called Beijing roasted duck in Chinese so if it is in Hong Kong it’s not the right recipe
Peking man is from now Beijing from around 70000 to 50000 years ago
Peking duck restaurants now cook the duck before they open in the morning so there is a limited amount, most restaurants now can order immediately
Mongolian beef and Chinese tacos, greaaaaaat
Ill always remember Uncle Martin for cooking dinner for Space Ghost ^^
my chinese language teachers were taiwanese and the *gasp* i let out when you said it wasnt a real country. it was like i could feel them looking over my shoulder smh
The carving technique of Peking duck looks a lot like jamón serrano.
Is that Jackie chan?
Is Jamie Oliver's fried rice not shiny then 😂😂😂
Yay!!! Finally chef Yan and uncle Rodger!!!
Uncle Yan will forever be my first and favorite chef I've ever watched! I watched him between age 11-14, such a fun man!
Taiwan saved Chinese culture while the CCP erased it...just sad...
Yan can cook!! ❤ I grew up watching him
Wait so asian chef fucks up the recipe and you compliment him but shit on white chefs? He butchered the recipe
"Aah look at this".   I love this show.. But forgot his name. This year I was actually searching for his videos. I always cracked up for his jokes and him saying aaah look this lol
Nostalgia overload! I used to watch the cooking shows on PBS on the weekends, especially Yan Can Cook. 😊
If only uncle roger had a good hairline like this guy! Oh if only.....
He didn't even mention any measurements. He use feeling in his cooking.
Those sizzling sound made my ancestors cry in proud tears 😭
Taiwan isn't a country because all Shina belongs to the Qing dynasty, and the emperor now is Xi JinPig 🐷🐖
His chopping was Morse Code for "FUIYOH!".
Uncle Martin? No, should be Great Uncle Martin!!!
I loved watching Martin as a kid.
Try Stephen Yan from Canada too. Same time much wok hay.
finallya vpn ad that doenst lie to you abt your privacy being 100% secure
I want to see more Uncle Yan
This guy is basically the bob ross of cooking
Yeedaq say that msg is overrated
Wok the heck?
Taco de pato that's a new one
I loved yan can cook! I watched that as a kid all the time !
Martin Yan is legendary, on par with Bruce Lee in my books.
As a Korean, I do have to admit Koshihikari rice tastes really good.
Uncle Roger smoked Gengis Khan in a salty way.😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/RsYdHpH4dNM?si=yIYh9vP2_8RbvhtL  This popped-up after watching uncle roger haha
2:51 only uncle roger can make me watch ads and even re-watch it.
Uncle Roger, Please send help!!!!  I mixed my cornstarch and msg into the same container and now even pandoras box is scared 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I met him in 2008, he was such a nice guy
Martin Yan is such a nice guy irl too
I can buy a Peking Duck at Tractor Supply for $5
Please do a review of WOK WITH YAN!  A Canadian icon - he’s hilarious 😂
BLUD TAIWAN IS REAL CHINA >:/
You should review @wokgod
I hope Nigel goes on a standup tour again.
Try to make a meal from hell's kitchen:)🤌
Can you rate his egg fried rice
i grew during the MSG hate days it was sad so many good mom and pop Chinese food shops were going out of business because of the hate people were giving them about MSG because they believed all the lies that were made to just spread Asian hate.
@1:07mins gangsta move 😂❤
How did I miss this?  I love Uncle Yan!  My sisters and I grew up watching Yan Can Cook.  Awesome guy!
Why you showing me my ex wife 😂😂😂
Before Yan Can Cook, i think there a show called Wok With Yan.
We wish Mr Yan will collaborate with Uncle Roger for the sake of humanity ...
It depends on where you go. I haven't seen Peking Duck served for more than $75 USD, usually its around 45-60. I imagine in places like NY and CA it'd be inflated like crazy though.
I met him when I was about 10 in Calgary Alberta Canada 🇨🇦  ✨️🧡✨️
Saturday mornings, after cartoons were done, PBS time and it was Martin Yan, Justin Wilson, and Julia  Child exposing my tiny rural Indiana brain  to culture and flavor. His skill with a knife and his positive, affirming voice were mesmerizing. That szying "If Yan can cook, you can too!" Was burned into my brain and inspired me to try tasting and cooking food from cultures I had no experience with. It led to a lifelong love of cooking and an openness to new things that would lead me out of my little rural town and into a much wider world.  Legend almost seems to humble.
Nobody save from uncle Roger roasting, even his sponsor
I love that man.   My mother always watched his show and when we were kids watched it too of course.
Uncle roger, could you make a sweet & sour dish? Or crispy chilli beef?  I bet mine is better😉
I love how relentless you are on Jamie Oliver. Ball busting him every episode. Man I love that lmao
PBS OG!
Taiwan is a country. Shut up
Remember watching his cook show on Singapore Channel,as I stay in Johor so we are able to get their signal..the good all days..☺️
This brings back memories. When we were fresh off the boat (the plane) from Jamaica 🇯🇲 to the USA, a whole new world of opportunities and food opened up to us. My father and I would watch Yan Can Cook on PBS. My father was so inspired that he bought a wok and started shopping at smaller local markets.  We Jamaicans love our spices, seasonings, ginger, bok choy, cabbages, etc. so lots of wonderful fusion foods were born. Uncle Yan is the best ❤
You know that 80s audience went right back to the mass orgy porno they were shooting before they were interrupted with that cooking show. Only difference is that now they're all hungry.
When Uncle Roger talked in American accent in the bloopers it was like finding out Santa is not real 😢
The red bell pepper has my attention. I love Mongolian Beef but around here they only add onions and green onions.
The only thing I really remember about Yan is his chopping.
need to get uncle roger some a/c, or take off his shirt. (sorry children.)
uncle roger is fine af😍
Yan Can Cook was my favorite cooking show as a kid!!! I loved that show
"He's th 1 st person to bring flavor to America"😂😂😂  Boi you been smoking that" Hi yah "😂😂
👍👍👍❤
I grew up watching Martin Yan on channel 9.  This was so awesome to see on your channel!
If yan can cook so can you!!!! I havent seen yan since i was a kid kid
“inflation is bullshit”？No, saying that the duck costs usd200 is
😂the social credit score bit
every 80's kids knows him...his cookng show was the best...
Im from WhatsApp
The “made with Lou” is where I been learning my Cantonese cooking since the pandemic.
Uncle Roger my mom kick me out after I put mayonnaise on my fried rice
Thanks to you uncle roger now im binge watching yan can cook everyday
Had the pleasure to watch Yan when I was a kid here in Fiji on public TV. Truly an inspiration. I can remember watching my family at the kitchen so that I can learn how to cook as well.
Uncle Roger your new patient, Aunty Lawson made daal🤣
I kinda like that cleaver chopping 4:19 it reminds me of hello fresh commercial
I should add that Peking duck is a 2-course meal in Beijing, not 3 courses. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the meat is only stir-fried in Cantonese regions.
Wok with Yan was such a beautiful thing to watch as a kid in the 90s. His apron sayings were amazing!   "Over wok, under paid" "Woks new pussycat" "Wok on the wild side" "Wok the heck" "All wokked up" "Wok goes in must come out"
Legend, respect from the bay!
Remember. If yan can cook so can you
Learned to make Lemon Chicken Soo Gai from Martin's tv show. He's Chinese cooking sifu. My shifu would end up being the head chef at the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong.
One thing about ONE PIECE on Netflix Japan, it doesn’t have English Subtitles. So unless you are near native in Japanese you won’t enjoy it.
Lagendary
I watched Uncle Yan as a child in south africa ha ha ha will never forget he always said "i grow it in my back garden"😅
i loved watching him when i was a kid.  him and julia child
"Uncle Roger social credit score just go up" I died laughing at this
I watched his show back in the 80s when I was a kid. His dancing chicken was my favorite thing.
in Canada before there was a Yan can cook we already had a show called Wok with Yan that was on in the late 70's.
Inflation is bullshitz, finally every all culture can come together.😂
I forgot i added this to my watch later vids and its playing as i make stir fry. Uncle Roger would be proud 🥹💜🤣 so much msg
I got to meet him a couple months ago and he told me I could open a restaurant just using his cook books if I wanted to lol
The 80's and 90's were a simpler time
Uncle roger at 8:06 :what is Peking man? Typing Peking man and he throw towel ahh, why you show me a picture of my ex wife  Lol, he thought Peking man was his ex wife 😂
one piece has season?
Have you looked into Stephen Yan, he had a show in Canada called "Wok with Yan" ? Martin apparently worked for him for a period of time there.
taiwan is really not  country
support taiwan not a country!
Here in Philippines too The rice is very expensive
There's a restaurant near here that specializes in Peking duck. No notice needed, because they make *lots* of it.
I used to watch this guy break down a chicken in 8 seconds Martin Yan Can Cook, PBS 🎉❤
I combine Cornstarch, Baking Soda, and MSG.
If you know, you know... 🤭
You need to review Canadian legend Stephen Yan.
7:03 Look good, Uncle Roger would eat that.  Audience: That's what he said.
Oh baby, what a blast from the past.  I used to watch Yan Can Cook on PBS in the 80s as a kid whenever I was home sick from school.  Forget about the Price is Right... PBS cooking shows, especially Yan Can Cook, was the proper daytime television .
People who came here from the WhatsApp channels  ⬇️
I watched Yan cooking show when I lived in Toronto.
Yan had a better hairline than Uncle Roger, lol, so sad, so sad. Be careful of your comb line, Uncle Roger.
It's interesting that you'd call him your hero. He would never roast people who attempt to cook their non native food. Martin Yan is sublime.
I never forget the phrase "Yan can cook", i adored this show back when i was a kid, this is the first Chinese host i watched on TV
Loved his show back in the 80's. PBS 13 !
Stephen Yan is my OG Uncle Yan.
If you dont have chilli oil mayby chilli jam would be a option as well 😂
Yan, along with the rest of the line up in the 80's was the peak of quality and wholesome shows that no only entertained you but was just as informational as well. I wish life was that simple still. I can still remember watching hours of shows on PBS laying in my grandmothers floor on a quilt that she made, taking a break from riding my bike around the neighborhood in the summers heat.
My grandma had all of yan recipes in a rolladex...Yan is a legend.
uncle martin yan was the best , i loved watching all his shows and food. definitely inspiring chef
Tio, porque estas sudando tanto? 🥵🥹😅
Isn't Peking duck served with a sweet wheat paste sauce? It's very similar to hoisin, but not the same
I am team Stephen Yan
I so miss Martin Yan and the cooking shows of old. Nowadays they are all horrible competitions.
OG Martin Yan always uses a non stick wok! You need to blast his ass for that! 😂
Martin Yan was a favorite of mine, but have you ever seen 1 hour Peking Duck? Ming Tsai made it on Iron Chef America to rave reviews. Might want to check it out Uncle Roger... 😁
If Yan can cook so can you
Uncle Roger can just kick tf back and spend the rest of his yt career making comentary on Yan can Cook vids.
"Wok With Yan"...
Martin Yan is great, but he is like little cousin to Stephen Yan - wok with Yan is so damn funny and a great part of my childhood.
I've met him several times. Super awesome person.
Even Kay can cook
Uncel Roger when are you going to do your own version?
I used to watch Yan with my grandmother.
I loved Yan Can Cook so much!!!!! But it makes me sad cause im that old now i remember loving Yan Can cook
In 90's The TV Show Cook With Yan once made an national issue in Indonesia when Uncle Yan cook pork in the show.
I love Martin Yan! I watched this as a kid with my mom.
The whispering of Taiwan lol love it
I’m from Mongolia, But i never tasted this kind of dish here 😅😅
Sorry that's your future wife, in the future.
This new One Piece is good.
I used to watch Yan Can Cook on PBS as a young child. I loved that show.
Uncle, you should check out the OG's O.G. - -  Stephen Yan.  He brought flavour to Canada and Martin worked for and probably learned everything he knows from Stephen.
What a blast from the past. I just realised the reason I know how to Julienne was from watching Yan can cook growing up in Nigeria. absolute legend!
"...inflation is bullshit."
Yes, in Shanghai, a lot of restaurants served Peking duck with Sugar.  But haven't found any that do it in Guangzhou.
Can you get air conditioning already hiya! Are they paying you with orange shirts only?😂
woooow, i remembered wok with yan
I want to see more Martin Yan! I thought his show was cool when I was a kid. What about Ming Tsai? The other Asian PBS chef
"no one has the attention span", but he roasted adam liaw for not being fast enough.
UNCLE ROGER WE NEED YOU>>>>>>REVIEW JAMES MAYS: Oh Cook! Season 1 Episode 1 Asian Fusion Episode  PLEASE UNCLE ROGER
Shouldnt he be uncle yan? I aw him debone an entire chicken in 6 swconds
Also before kimchi was at a supermarket
Yan Can Cook So Can You 😂
i love the one piece og hahhahahah not the La one
never seen panda make Mongolian beef but their beef usually is too chewy 😢
"Some say it's all skin" like that's a bad thing lmfao The skin is the best part.
His show is wok with yan
Uncle roger, I know a few of your favourite phrases: "Vegetables taste like sad" "Fuyioh". And I love how you said if vegetables taste like sad, then mangetout taste like terror. And don't ever let Jamie Oliver get to chili jam.
Yan Can Cook was one of my favorite shows as a little kid.  On days when I was allowed to watch this much TV, I'd go from Sesame Street to Mr. Rodgers to Yan Can Cook on PBS.
Martin yan brought how to cook Chinese food and uncle Rodger says it brought flavor to America. China also brought America the Korean War and the Vietnam war. Go back to history class if you don’t understand that sentence, because you dropped out to work in “noodle shop”.
Asian food is my favorite form of food. If I was to die today, I would request an Asian chef to make my last meal.
We need a Yan/Roger collab more than ever... I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed this show growing up.
When I do Asian accent my friend's say I sound EXACTLY like uncle Roger 😂😂😂
I was so much of a fan that I have the same wok he’s using.and his books ❤
😂 you can’t tell me this ain’t uncle Roger father
Thats not how you make it all. The sauce is sugar, oyster, dark soy.
I always loved Yan can cook . I always wondered why meat tasted different thanks
Do a Jacques pepin reaction. He is from the same era and amazing cook.
I will risk it I’m in my confrontational mode: Jamie Oliver is the Martin Yen of Europe 😂
1:14 there’s a video responding to when you called Cambodian food bad 😂
Aren’t you a 90s kid? You were not even born in the 80s weren’t youuuuu 😂
Taiwan small but real country but China big but not a real country coz they attack other country capture and put them in their map.
Martin Yan is the Uncle Prime.
What a trip down memory lane, my childhood watching Yan Can Cook brings back fond memories.
I so loved watching Yan Can Cook. He made it sound so simple and accessible to everyone, and just felt warm and welcoming.
And the fact he's Canadian❤
This reminded me of all the time I spent watching Emeril on PBS as a kid in the late 90s/early 2000s. Love Yan's demeanor!
HA!  Used to watch him back in the 80s too.  And you know what?  We didn't have the attention span back then either.  We'd see the plating start, and change the channel for a minute or so, and when we came back, they were just about finished with the plating.
Martin Yan, his early shows in Canadian TV, "Golden brown!"
I guarantee a good time if Uncle Roger makes himself some Justin Wilson dishes. I always wanted to see Yan and Justin do a colab when I was young.
This is cool! I grew up watching Yan Can Cook.
There could be a million Asian chef's on  tv and be excellent at what they do but they will never be the one and only Martin Yan if Yan can cook so can you thank you for the great memories from my childhood in the early 80s❤
When I first saw him his show was called Wok With Yan. Ah memories
I loved watching him when I was a kid!
Was it just me or was the chopping asmr actually good?
As a lil kid watching PBS his show was awesome 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Yan Can Cook was the first cooking show i watched and i loved it.
dont say dollar say dorrar
First tv chef who made it look so easy. My fav shows from the 80s
That everyday towel is very asian 🤣🤣
I just made Yan's mongolian beef recipe a week or so ago.  My wife met him years ago, he signed a cookbook and left me a voicemail while I was at work before I was getting ready to go back to school for a business degree.  He's a legend and a great human being!  And his recipes are great.
don't just sit there and stare.
I stayed home sometimes to watch this on PBS..
If Yan can cook you can to ❤
Can you review Eat Drink Man Woman opening cooking scene
"why you show my ex wife"😭😭
i used to watch wok with yan
Uncle Roger may be arrested by CCP because of his humor😂
Pecking duck is also my fave 🤤🤤
I remember this cooking show as a kid😊 It all started in the 70's in British Columbia with Stephen Yan. Ahhh the memories!!
I'm used to Mongolian beef without red bell peppers.  Also, the sauce usually has oyster sauce instead of hoisin.
Fun fact, Martin Yan also talks different off camera. It was part of the presentation.
Thank you for sharing good shows from mu youth!  I am 57!  Fun stuff an not full of.....it!  I would love to see you and Yan make some food together!
As someone turning 40 next month, I can say, Yan can Cook was my very first favorite cooking show!
im Mongolian and there beef pretty good!
I LOVED Yan Can Cook as a kid.
1:09 😵 YO CHILL!!!!!! LMFAO
He’s like the bob Ross of cooking
*including Taiwan* and uncle roger u right because u never wrong (exept with biryani) Taiwan is not a contry
Martin Yan! The OG
Why you show picture of my ex wife😂😂😂😂
Peking is also the former name of Beijing
I absolutely adore him! Yan Can Cook was aired on PBS. As a child it was one of my favorites. Mother’s Day when I was in kindergarten I was insistent that my mom needed a wok. So that’s what she got.
👏👏👏👏 uncle roger is probably in love rn 😂😂😂
I loved it when Yan and Jaques Pepin partnered up a few times. Two wonderful teachers from my childhood.
Good lord that man is genius.
Martin Yan was the man who introduced me to cooking and enjoying great food. I remember buying his book and trying as many recipes as I could. The man is a legend and great entertainer.
Yan isn't uncle he is grandpa.
Asian culture doesn't promote the words you use. The speech is clean enough for younger audience. Asia might cancel you Uncle Roger if you don't watch your words in these videos.
Oh here in the Philippines, I remember Wok with Yan. 😁
Uncle roger turned on for cleaver chopping, iam turned on for cleavage popping 😂
Martin Yan chops in Morse Code. Love that man. 😊
I guess uncle roger grew up with posters of yan on his bedroom wall lol. Nice of him to pay homage. This guy was th original
You need to do nore
Another famous chinese cooking show was Wok with Yan. presented by canadian Stephen Yan.
I grew up watching Stephen yan “wok with yan” so I always called this guy “imitation yan”
Loves this dude, always hit you with "and then add a tiny, tiny bit of..."
I loved watching Yan Can Cook as a kid.
My favorite TV chef was Graham Kerr  the "Galloping Gourmet" He would quietly get snockered through the show then pick the prettiest girl in the audience to share it with him. His show would never fly today lol
Uncle Roger was 7-17 in the 80s
Since you used Made with Lau's video clip are you going to review some of their recipes and give Daddy Lau the Uncle title?
Taiwanese laugh at “ Taiwan is not a real country” joke China people trigger if ever anyone say “Taiwan is a country” So easy to see the difference of quality
I LOVE when you bust the chops of "white" people.
Yan is still alive and kicking at age 74.
U becareful talking shit about Taiwanese people we will find out where u live ......😊
It’s not pronounced Genghis Khan it’s pronounced Chingas hon
I am Mongolian
Was it Yan that also started making the aprons with sayings on it using "Wok" instead of "Walk?" As in Wok with Yan, Wok together.... etc. ??
anyone from hong kong getting nostalgic? i am
finally man, been saying to do yan for so long. now do chef ming from blue ginger.
Martin Yan is the Julia Child of Chinese-American food.
I took my cooking class to a Yang can cook video shooting segment back in the late 90's. He's quite a master and the students lived him. He did his signature bell pepper "roll-out" cut which was great to watch.
Oh my God I loved watching yan can cook
Taiwan is a country just so everyone knows
Um, that would be baking soda that fluffs the beef and chicken in Chinese restaurants not corn starch......  the starch is to thicken the sauce... 😂. Ayaaaa!
The MY clipped used is from late 80s to early 90s. (Purple was a popular fashion of that time). When his show first launched in the early they’re was a girl assistant/sidekick — a token prop to draw in the American audience.
A neighbor wondered how I learned to use a cleaver so well 😅
UNCLE YAN WAS THE BEST DO NOT FUCK AROUND WITH HIM!
OMG I MISS THAT SENTENCE! "If Yan can cook, so can You! 再见."
Just saw him yesterday
peiking duck is not even from beijing it's cantonese.. The complete irony.
Love Mr. Yan! Coolest guy EVER. When I was 9 or 10 he had dinner at our house, he loved my mother's Chicken Prosciutto recipe. And yes, he smiles all of the time just like he does on his show 😂
I grew up watching Martin Yan alongside Julia Childs. He always made me feel like I could legitimately make Chinese food (like Bob Ross made me feel like I could paint) and I never could, but I thank him for the inspiration. Uncle Martin Fuiyoh!
I remember that guy!
Tai wan comment . Risky . But guess your already canceled in China 😅 might aswell hit at the pla abit .
Wok with Yan was the best !
Man I remember watching at least one episode of this show when I was a kid. It was on PBS. They had him for Asian Cuisine and then they also had Bob Ross.
I remember a cooking show on CBC during the 80s called Wok with Yan. Could this be the same show but rebranded for Canada?
i will always remember the episode where uncle yan slams a  clove of garlic into oblivion.
MSG is my friend
I like you
bro i am 11 but i can cook fried rice if you come to the UAE i promise it is not garbage jaime oliver shift
very dangerous cutting
Martin Yan is a Genius!! He has degrees in culinary arts, nutrition. He was the first to discuss the health benefits and risks of foods.
He even went to hell's kitchen before, can ask uncle gordon about it😂
Hey uncle roger, we got the same towel fuiyah haha ist hat a good morning towel
Martin Yan my childhood
Yan was one of the tv cooks back in the day that contributed to me becoming an avid and good cook. ❤️🇦🇺
It would be epic if Yan did come on your show.  Lol.
Uncle roger can you review south asian cooking
Trước khi có internet , mr Yan đã có mặt trên truyền hình HTV 7 Vietnam vào mỗi buổi chiều . Vị đầu bếp này là ký ức tuổi thơ của bọn trẻ con 9x chúng tôi :)))
ASMR
Martin Yan chopping has stayed with me all the way from my childhood. Loved this man
Review food from my village channel. You will like it .
3:26 I cried when he said fuyio instead of FUYIO!

"Hot wok, cold oil, food won't stick! "
+9999999999
Spent many days growing up watching Martin Yan on "sick days" with grandma 😊
Potato starch better than corn starch. Hayiaa!
Uncle Roger watching his dad cook 😂
Uncle Roger can you review hikenmasuda his shrimp fried rice
Bro Jamie Oliver used to cook so good before my brother watched him a lot hahaha but rn he experiments with random shit sometimes it's bad like fried rixe
Yan was my hero as a kid!
My mom used to watch Yan Can Cook when we were kids in the 90s and still uses some of his recipes to this day. :)
I used to watch Yan can cook every day after school. He was so funny, the field trips were awesome. I wanted to be a chef like him 😂
Congrats to Jamie Oliver's son on having his own TV show....just don't spit into the food when you talk on live TV. It's disgusting and make me want to puke!
And quit with that accents, we're not in the 06 anymore
Today, we got the guys that say Cambodian foods is disgusting
best knife skills, watched him in the 80s
Im from mongolia
What 7yr old religiously watched Yan Can Cook?!? Me!  Yan is what happens when mythical creatures reincarnate! True OG!
Holy crap I remember Yan Can Cook!!
I used to watch Martin yang every Saturday
uncle yan is my hero too
Martin Yan ignited my love for cleavers!
Martin Yan was always my favorite of the PBS Chefs.
Hello uncle Roger you are my fav youtuber
Making peking duck sounds like a daftpunk song..  cook it, freeze it, dry it, roast it.
"Ahhhh" - Uncle Roger 2023
I've never seen anything from this chef before, but he is a delight to watch work!
He still does live and video
Martin Yan is one of the greats.
Don't believe the lie. Netflix has a VPN blocker
hey uncle Roger. What age did you become an uncle
Wok the Heck… this should be about Wok With Yan. Now You’re Woking. Woks New Pussycat. Don’t Wok the Boat. Wok on the Wildside. Wok up a Storm. Over Wok Under Pay…. And he loves MSG… Wok more can you say? ❤
Brings back memories. I used to watch him with my grandmother when I was a kid. Him and Justin Wilson ( the Cajun dude) were her 2 favorites.
❤️❤️I love Martin Yan show❤️❤️ thanks Uncle!👋👋
Should review the man cutting up a whole chicken. Made me want to be a chef when I was a kid.
Almost thought Mongolian beef was made-up just to sound exotic to everyone.
No, dont add sugar, the sauce and the peppers and green onion is enough. I love my local Chinese restaurant because its not too western. Chinese restaurants can be the best or worst food youve ever tasted.
Uncle roger at 9M subs will u visit uncle Wang gang
i am new i love your videos:) bro i am also an Asian kid like you uncle roger can you make a video for chicken korma:)
I remember this being shown in our local TV, wok with yan 😅 I was amazed of his cooking!
UNCLE ROGER BANNED IN CHINA FUIYAAAAA
https://youtube.com/shorts/th8BcsT27yk?si=CsiIj90cjhXKQTkL
That stare fry joke had me dying. Why have I never seen this incredible chef. I will be grabbing some recipes from him.
Delicious cooking recipe: 1: put oil in pan  2: crack egg inside pan 3: add MSG 4: break instant ramen inside pan 5: mix until the egg mixes with the instant ramen          Please reply😢
Ah I remember him and also wok with yan, but I thought wok with yan was the first. Heoooo...... !!!
The OG's OG: Stephen Yan, of Wok With Yan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9-vxC0YqFg
80‘s and 90's are the best. We dont live in the fear of being accused of a racist by SJW all the time.
review Indian chef please
yan can cook was my favorite cooking show. Also Martin knew Ghengis Khan really didnt eat it and that its really an american dish like general tsaos chicken. He was just having fun with his audience and we all knew it.
I learned to cook by watching Wok with Yan and Yan can cook late 80s, my childhood memories
I like seeing a review of this older content once in a while. It's interesting to see how things have changed.
Thank you for the memories, and a really excellent incorporation of your sponsor, Express VPN. I didn't fast forward a second!
Please check also boy logro of the Philippines😊
Motel 6 bibigo fried rice and pagoda egg roll
I liked Wok With Yan
YOOO UNCLE ROGER RECOGNIZED TAIWAN
Good vids you got
I am sorry
Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, is a country in East Asia.
Just popping in to say Martin Yan is the man. Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsey.... fuck outta here. Give me Martin Yan all day every day
7:40 The Good morning towel, i love my asian heritage
I used to watch Yan Can Cook, too!  His sense of humor made us laugh!
“I cannot believe it myself” Loved watching Martin Yan as a kid
Definitely like to see a colab between Martin Yan and Uncle Roger.
bro thank you for covering the OG!!! Uncle Martin blessed us with only basic channels!
The thing I liked about OG Uncle was that every ingredient measurement from a pinch to a pound was a "tiny, tiny bit".
I was an 8 year old orphan who learned to cook Chinese foods because of Martin Yang. I've booked to meet him in Perth 19, 2023.
only Ungle Roger can say both "country" and "taiwan" in one sentence.
Hey uncle Roger, try these dumplings, they're pretty good. bibigo steamed pork and vegetable dumplings. They're Korean dumplings.
"Taiwan not a real country" *Social Credit Score increases*
Martin only talks like that for tv.
Yan can cook so can you but not Jamie Oliver
Used to watch Martin all the time...  he amazed me one day when he made homemade noodles and pulled them till he had over a million noodles!  He even counted as he did it... 2 -4 -8 -16 all the way till it was over a million!
Wok this way
Martin Yan was always my favorite person to watch cook however he was far funnier in front of a crowd...
Martin Yan is why I became a chef!
Would Martin Yan sprinkle MSG on Mongolian Beef!
I grew up watching this show. He taught me how to debone a chicken
200 dollars for a Peking Duck. Times 4.5 and we reach brazilian price. :')
I was fallow to this wounderful Cheff from TV shows before to my son was born on the 90's I was learn and love how him was explaining each dish 😋👌🏻👍🏻 my admiration and respect to Martín Yan 🙏🏼👏🏻
As a youth I watched Graham Kerr, the Galloping Gourmet. In the early days of Food Network I thoroughly enjoyed Justin Wilson, the Cajun Chef (I Gah-ron-tee) and it was Yan who inspired me to start learning basics. I still have some video tapes of his shows that I recorded.
Yan can cook was great he was also like MR. Rogers when he use to go into factories and show how Chinese food was made or how woks where made. LOL LOL I use to watch him on wttw Chicago channel 11 next to Julia Childs show
You should do a video on Wok With Yan. He was rad too!
Uncle roger u HAVE to do a collab with Uncle Yan!
If yen can cook so can you.
I used to watch Yan Can Cook on PBS in the 1980's. What a great show!!!
I love this... I used to watch Yan Can Cook all the time when I was a kid.  Uncle Yan is the best.
Jacques pepin next
I used to watch this show as well as Wok with Yan.
Remembered in the 80’s and 90’s watching Martin Yan in Hong Kong. He did some cooking shows in Cantonese at his mom’s home at Mei Foo.
"If Yan can cook, so can you, zai jian!"
I love how Nigel casually insults the Chinese government with the credit score and Taiwan stab 😂 such an underrated move!
I counter with "Wok with Yan". made by Steven Yan in Vancouver.. Canadian version... more jokey... fun... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTjwTieqhJY
Is it possible to make koshihikari rice fried rice on a hex clad wok??
https://fb.watch/ndDII0cOYf/?mibextid=Nif5oz  This is something you must review and also one more advice is watch till end 😂 (If you are reading my comment just check this video once)
Real talk, as a kid born in the 80s, Yan Can Cook was one of my favorite shows on PBS because the food looked so good and Martin Yan could "julienne" vegetables like a MF.
Every culture has its own taste palette its your job to make the food compatible for that palette
I used to watch this show with my mom ❤
OMG I loved watching him when I was a kid! But his catch phrase confused me. I was like i can't cook like you.... you have your own show!  😊 if yan can cook then so can you! Yeah probably not 😂
Used to watch Yan on PBS back in the early 90s!
Social score ⬆️ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Made me tear up seeing this. Good memories.
This guy teach how to cook. jamie olive oil teach how to destroy asian food.
They are laughing when they put the wood in the oil to look if its ready and hot but that's actually true try a toothpick in putting on oil when it's bubbling it's ready for deep frying .
Uncle roger should check out Swedish Ordinary Meal time 😂
Review chef wann Malaysia
And thai is my first language😂
ancle roger can you make good sambal belacan i can't make it like my moms

Grew up watching Martin Yan, Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, Jeff Smith, Justin Wilson, and so many other great chefs, the 80s were a great time to learn to cook!
Martin Yan is so wholesome person. I love his energy in his every TV show
Martin Yan was one of my early inspiration for cooking I cooked  my first beef tomato watching him
I like the duck taco, Uncle Roger!!
Comment for the algorithm
Still remember when he made a joke about woking the dog lol

I used to watch Yan on the Cooking Channel.
There is also the OG: Wok with Yan! 😁 12:43
Maaaan, Yan Can Cook.....I haven't watched this since the 90s😂
I think I would've made Uncle Roger proud. I got a Jamie Oliver short on my YouTube fyp, and I clicked not interested. Video went away... no more Jamie Olive Oil!
China = West Taiwan
Uncle roger I'd suggest you to review chef boy logro from the Philippines
This my new favourite chef after Raekwon .. I would love to meet Uncle Roger before I die
My late grandmom and i love him too! And ur takes for that towel shock throw, i thought i heard a crow!!! 😂🤣
I had the duck skin with sugar when I was in Beijing in 2011, for an average white person it sounds kind of unusual, but it's delicious 💥💥
Ah the 80s… Pretty sure this man is why my dad attempted to cook damn near everything in his wok 😂
You NEED to have him on your show or on his show or anything!!!  You NEED TO WORK TOGETHER!!
I remember watching Yan and The Cajun Cook Justin Wilson. Seeing Justin getting drunk while cooking was hilarious
Now there isn’t even a need to say “Sorry children” hahahaa
I used to volunteer as a kid on the public station in Sacramento, CA, in the mid/late 80s and got to mee him!!! He was one of the nicest, most fun people EVER!!!! I ADORE HIM, and I'm so glad that you finally got around to him. Thank uou Uncle Roger for bringing back a wonderful childhood memory!
Boy Uncle Rodger, you done opened a can of worms you think you Uncle you Uncle this is great-great-great-grandfather. King of Asian American cuisine white people's idol that had to learn so Easley fuyoo
Uncle Rodger. You not grow up with Yan can cook! Hiyaaaa.  That's why Uncle Rodger has no kitchen in front of him. I put my my leg down !. You best respect The OG,s or I not watch your channel no more😅
From Mongolia but never seen that food in mongolia😂
All of the Iron Chef’s kneel to Wan Kan Kook
Peking_Beijing Duck is my all time fav. Perfectly done in this weedio.
Clever sound like Morse code..
Nah got to have it with rice and he's missing some super key ingredients!! You will only find in China or an Asian grocer!! I'm not telling what they are as it will give away my Mongolian Lamb secrets!!
Oop! God bless Uncle Roger 🙏🏻❤️‍🔥✝️
But where is he now?
What a great video. I didn’t know about Yan but it was interesting to see his cooking skills, his personality, and his ability to make it entertaining. I’m going to make this dish for sure
loved watching his show when I was a kid.
plz review more weejio from yan plz
Yan Can Cook was such a great show.  My sister and I used to watch it after school.  We always quoted the line "It STIR fry not STARE fry"
He was my hero growing up, and one of the reasons I still love to cook.   ❤
I was watching Yan in New York in the early to mid 70s!
Yan can cook was ok, but wok with Yan the real og
Oh, be still my heart ❤️ Yan Can Cook is my whole childhood ❤
This “Uncle Roger”character is brilliant.
Over here, his show was called “Wok with Yan”. Loved watching his show back then. Legend indeed.
ever thought about saving some or all of the bloopers for Patreon or some kind of premium product beyond the free one here?
Still, one China policy, right? Mongolian beef of Hongkong. Taiwan not real country, fuyouh!
you remind me of another show called "Wok with Yan"
Uncle Rodger reacting to Classic PBS Yang?! Is… aaaaaya!🎉😎🤌😤
Here is link to video Uncle Roger reacting to: https://youtu.be/Jok7VlJxjos?si=r2jApz0-WUX-Uvy6
Uncle 10M on the way
Yan can cook was a show I would stop what I was doing and watch it.
He was awesome, great memories.
I loved him!!
Uncle Martin and <we dont say his name because we found out some things> on PBS in the 80s kept me engaged in the kitchen as a kid. I never got too deep into chinese cooking, but it made the kitchen a fun place to cook whatever I was making. I'm nowhere near a chef, but I've been able to consistently make tasty things without poisoning myself all my life, so thats a win.
U need to try this with tricolate 🔥
didn't realize Uncle Roger was a fan of Mous phone cases
In Canada we also had a show in the 1970's called Wok with Yan. Another classic!
Loved Martin Yan.
Why must you mention Taiwan not a real country.. it's very sensitive for some people
The social credit score joke was amazing. 😂😂
Uncle Roger has to watch this
Martin Yan the legend
Taiwan ROC is the rightful government of mainland China! One day we will return and seize the land back from the communist bandits!
mandarin pancake just looks like flour tortilla, then rolled in to a fajita
Uncle roger chick-fill-a uses msg to make there chicken taste better
Firt time UR isn't sh*tting in this video. XD So wholesome! But im afraid UR is getting too weak!
Martin Yan is the Godfather!!
I love Yan Can Cook
I used to watch this on pbs. Was one of my favorites
You should meet him and cook with him
I remember him i miss his show.
Uncle roger is 40 confirmed.
I grow up watching yan i waited for sesame street to be over on pbs and watch all the cooking shows great times 😂
Yan was so impressive, even more back then because so few could match his knife skills at the time. He showed seriously white people that you could make good Asian food at home. I loved watching his show.
I love your videos uncle roger
Uncle roger Jamie Oliver is trying to come to my school to teach us to make food 😧
We eat vegetables to stay healthy, even if you disagree, they still taste good.
Met Martin Yan at the 1989 pork expo. After his show in the expo, my family and I talked to him for hours. Such a nice guy, and he let us eat his food he cooked. He didn't have any forks or chopsticks so we ate it with toothpicks. Memory I will never forget. So delicious.
I watched him many years ago. Love him!
I loved yan!!!!!!
Please review one piece video uncle roger
Is this same person that did Wok With Yan?
Yah was awesome
I grew up watching Wok with Yan and all his apron puns! 🤣🤣🤣
Feels weird to watch young Uncle critique Master. 👁️👁️
I looooove yan!! As a kid it was him and Julia child's amd it's where I learned to cook and I was quite a accomplished chef in my youth .....I literally learned my knife skills from Yan and sooooo many little skills that actually separated me from the other chefs and helped elevate my career and I've designed a handful of restaurants amd one day I'll open my own hopefully......all because of Yan.....took me out of the ghetto love you dude
Look up Martin Yan’s demonstration of parting a chicken in 12 cuts. Master class.
Love the video, takes me back. At one point I had a Martin Yan rice cooker that came with his cookbook haha.
Taiwan not even real country. social credit gone up. LEGEND
I watched this guy growing up.
What do you say on bryan Johnson's blueprint?😂
I grew up in Israel watching Yan Can Cook on pirate cable  😂always loved him s true legend.
My mom likes recipes from the 80s and earlier, I should show her some of Chef Yan's stuff and see if it piques her interest. Maybe he can teach her about flavor where I have failed...
I remember watching his show. Thanks for a walk down memory lane.
Chopping cleaver ASMR please!
Martin Yan is also brilliant diplomat, tour guide, generous host!
AH! TYSM! YAN CAN COOK! LOVE HIM!
I can see the inspiration
I love Yan
uncle roger pretend taiwan not real country to suck up to west taiwan
He was Canadian; shamr on uncle roger
Daddy Lau appearance.  Lovely.
Thank you for this fantastic nostalgia trip Uncle Roger.
Ah, now I need to know what Uncle Roger thinks of Ken Hom, who did similar TV cooking programmes in the UK
had to turn off the AC for recording, ouch
FUYOH! I watched Yan Can Cook every day growing up!!! It was my first cooking show! :D
I loved Yan Can Cook.
He's more Uncle Roger than Uncle Roger
Cornstarch and msg "guarantee orgasm"  🤣🤣🤣
I normally don't like, but gotta show support for Taiwan
I teared up. I watched him to learn how to cook in general. He was so straightforward about the ease of cooking. Loved his show.
Sorry but uncle Roger is nothing close to Martin Yan
Dude made a peking duck taco.  I approve.
I lived in China for 15 years. I think most Chinese would start the wok with the red pepper slices and spring onions. They take longer than the beef to cook. Undercooked peppers aren't great.
I grew up with Uncle Yan, he taught me to chop.
I love Yan Can Cook! I adored that show when I was a child. He was the cook that made me want to cook. I wanted to be able to cut food like him. It was like watching magic. And he was so lovely with that beautiful smile. 😊❤ wonderful memories.
Uncle roger you need to get Uncle Yan on your show! it would be EPIC!
Guys.......... We need Uncle Roger back in an orange sleeveless shirt🧡. Do u agree?🤔
01:07 Communist party of China aproves your words. +50 social credit +2 bowls of fried rice +catgirl wife
Uncle Roger, how about reviewing the real OG Yan - Stephen Yan of Wok With Yan too? to my knowledge, Stephen came before Martin and Martin even worked for Stephen before going out on his own.
🇹🇼 Uncle Roger pick fight with Taiwan... 10M Subs challenge is Niu Rou Mian - Taiwanese beef noodle soup, 紅燒牛肉麵 (traditional only)
You also forgot another Asian cooking legend in the 80’s, Wok With Yan(Stephen Yan, hope I spelled it right). Now that guy was awesome as well.   Hope you can make a video with your thoughts about him too.🤙😊
a
ahahhaaha in the 90's in South Africa we had re-runs and my gran loved this dude....Yan can cook.....so can you...look at diss....look at dat
I used to watch this when i was home sick from school.
i used to watch his shows when I was 5. that guy is a legend!
You are so so funny bless you, for always making me smile❤
在油管上黑中国是政治正确，所以你的确从之前的搞笑节目那里获得了很多的流量和关注。反正中国媒体也不是你主要收入来源，在黑中国上获得的油管收益绝对超过你在中国媒体上的封杀。
Review dashiexp sushi & ramen
Did you hear, Jamie Olive Oil is gunna judge Masterchef Australia?
Martin Yan saying soya sauce and rice wine was iconic
Uncle Roger! How about having a look at Wok with Yan, Chinese-Canadian cooking show from the '80s!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTjwTieqhJY
Uncle Roger, I love your face towel, that is good morning towel right, very asian thing, that is a popular brand in the phillipines
Penuh inspirasi ❤️
Stephen yan.. is more OG.. wok with yan 😅
❤❤❤
Yan Can Cook was a favorite show of mine growing up!
please make an apology video about that taiwan joke. thats messed up even for you.
From Yan Can Cook/Julia Childs to Emeril Lagasse .. after that it went downhill.
"Uncle Roger social credit score just gone up!" Haha!
Foo Yohhhhhhhh
Yan Can Cook & Justin Wilson (Cajun cooking)!!
I will never be able to to make sushi again without thinking of you on the point of popping off. That's nasty.
When I a little kid in the 90s my mom and I would watch reruns of Yan Can Cook in the afternoons! It was such a fun time. "Yan can cook, so can you!" also someone's gotta sample that chopping there's a beat in there somewhere
The famous line if Yan can cook you can you is wrong look at Jamie Oliver
Would definitely be nice to see collaboration....  Yan is a Legend.
Uncle Roger, they mean the state, Taiwan 😂
There’s actually a episode where he makes msg out of salt and potatoes I think.
I think that’s the same music in 80’s Chinese duck skinflick!!… umm my friend 1 time told me she seen it yeah 😁
Dude you just dunked on The Bob Ross of Asian cooking what is wrong with you?
I remember Martin yan, I'm a PBS kid so yea. Lol
The man said stir fry, not stare fry.. Legend.
You definitely need to bring Uncle Yan in your show!! Would be Epic!
Heard about Uncle Yan in the #TISS podcast months back  Finally so happy to see what a legend Yan is  TISS army represent 😎
Man! I loved this show! This was pre Food network. I remember Julia Child and him way back when...
Back in the '80s, there were two famous Chinese Cooking Shows broadcasted in the Philippines. They were "Yan Can Cook" with Martin Yan (USA) and "Wok with Yan" with Stephen Yan. (CAD). "Wok with Yan" was shown first and was more popular. I always wanted a cook-off between the two Yans. 😊
so funny how a lot of the west think social credit score is actually a thing
As a kid I loooooved watching Yan can cook!! Never missed an episode
I loved watching Martin Yan as a kid. And whenever my dad made Chinese food, he'd say while he was making it, "Look at that!" 😊 Good times.
I loved his show. Sweet old 90’s.
Martin Yan is more popular but there’s also STEPHEN YAN. And he had a cook show called YAN CAN COOK back in the 80’s.
❤ Uncle roger you know ลาบก้อย?  I want Uncle Roger to eat Larb Koi. It's the best Thai food and it's delicious with MSG.
"if yan can cook, so can you". back in the late 90s-early 2000s, this man was a legend in Vietnam.
One OG also was Stephen Yan.. his show is called WOK with Yan.
Father bois prwuing ba
Martin Yan is OG Chinese cooking TV chef. He the man.
Grew up in Hawaii and this man could have been king.
I'm hungry now! 🤔🤣
What race is Uncle Roger nvm I know now
If you remember Martin's former boss--Stephen Yan--and his show 'Wok With Yan', you come from the best generation.  :grin:  Remember the crazy puns on his aprons?

Taiwan joke? rip the Fancy drop.
I loved watching him as a kid too...
Yan can cook and simply ming were my faaaavorite cooking shows back in the day
Both Uncle Roger and uncle yan have a fake accent.
He was my absolute favorite. I think he's one of the reasons I love to cook. I would watch him every time I could.
pekin duck burrito!
Memories! "If Yan can cook, so can you!"
Loved watching him as a kid. Made cooking fun
I used to watch him!
I love that you highlighted Martin Yan - he’s a longtime favorite of mine, so nice to see him in his prime - ❤❤
Used to watch Yan as a kid. He was my favorite chef until I found Morimoto on Iron Chef.
My dad taught himself how to cook Chinese from Martin Yan’s tv show and cookbook.
$150-200 for Peking Duck dinner in China? You're outta line here, Uncle: Siji Minfu in Beijing offers a complete dinner for 228RMB ($31USD).
Please review the OOG Chinese cooking show: Wok With Yan on CBC with Stephan Yan
My dad used to watch his show every day after he got off of work. He learned a lot of great recipes that we got to enjoy XD
Seeing all those white women knowing all by now their age of and in the right temperament to be Karens. 😂😂😂
Ginger yes. Sugar no! This is what happens when you fear MSG. You start cramming sugar into things where it doesn't belong.
This seriously made my day. My grandmother LOVED to watch Yan when I was little, anytime I got to stay home from school, it was Yan and Bob Ross in the house. She was a true lover of Chinese food, and whenever a new Asian restaurant opened in our city, she was the first one in line to give it a try. Always telling all the other old southern white women that poo-pooed at Asian food that they didn't know what they were missing out on. And if they wanted to be racist and not go, that was fine, more for her. She loved MSG to. To bad she didn't live long enough to see the birth of YouTube and Uncle Roger. She would have really loved everything Nigel does. Thanks for the trip down memory lane. I think I need to go look up all the old Yan episodes and have some Chinese food tomorrow.
My childhood inspiration, and untill now always check hot oil with bamboo chopstick
Martin Yan is truly the OG uncle chef!! I used to watch him on PBS back in the day.😊
Yan was my favorite show as a kid in 80s, this brings me back.
Never heard of this guy, is he famous in Asian households?

Fun fact of the day: Genghis Khan is totally different in Japan. In Japan, it's Lamb.
Uncle Roger, I'm so disappointed,  Yan Can Cook is Canadian,  HIYAA! Also,  we had a show called Wok With Yan which I also watched religiously
If you need a discount on that PH subscription hit me up!
😂  Blessings from Taiwan 🇹🇼 😇 🥰
Just a small note about martin....i saw one of his guest appearance in a local malaysian cooking show, showcasing a local negeri sembilan dish....as the chef was explaining her dish, martin just cut her off in the middle of spiel, and explained everything and have the camera cut off the chef....you can see the awkwardness of the chef and her uncertainty on how to proceed.  Maybe he was getting on in age or smt...but what he did as a guest there...was rude.
Uncle roger needs to react to Cajun fried rice by Bruce Mitchell!
Uncle Roger, you need to check out Jeremy's (School of Wok) most recent egg fried rice recipe.
12:34 crows be like
Wow! The memories!!
Aaaahh memories.  I used to watch " Yan Can Cook " during school holidays.
I watched him all the time when I was a kid 😊
Please review more Martin Yan weejios, Uncle Roger!  This reaction so funny, fuiyoh!!🤣🤣
taiwan real china hokay   ayyeeyaa *equips dried salamander*
Martin Yan?! Oh now we're cooking! I used to watch his show and a few others all the time with my dad back in the 90s.
Martin Yan was one of my first inspirations into taking my steps into a lifeling passion.  Man is the GOAT
I remember "Yan can cook " He was so entertaining..thank you for reviewing him
Express v p n is only for tiktok talkers and fans only contact creators.  Phù ü😂😅
Phucking mint 👌🏻
the uncle title is just "doctor who "but for flavor
Yan is such a legend. My interest in food and cooking in general can be attributed to him. Still love watching him make food.
I miss watching Yan Can Cook (so can you!) and wishing to watch it live and front row. Cause he let people in the front taste the food after!
Yan was the first chef I ever watched, as a kid. "If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!"
If Yan can cook, so can youuuu!!!!
Wait nobody's talking about how he plugged in the sponsorship 😭😭😭 man's a genius
“Two things you fear in the 80’s: HIV, and MSG.”  It’s almost ridiculous how true this statement is!
I met this man a few months ago at a culinary conference. Was such a pleasure. He taught me so much.
I hate how just yesterday I made the comparison of you two, and then I come onto YouTube and see this 😐😂
I feel like an uncle roger v Martin Yan collaboration coming along
I loved that show! I learned how to cook several dishes watching him.
Another thing that Uncle Roger has in common with OG Uncle Martin Yan:  the fake accent.  Sorry to dash childhood memories, but Martin Yan actually has accentless English 😊
I loved watching Yan Can cook as a kid!!
Why so sweaty?!  LOL
Small boy in the 80s?! I thought he was in his 20s for sure
I can’t remember Martin Yan using MSG.
Yes. Martin Yan is the OG of Chinese cooking shows
I've actually never had peking duck!!! I really want to try it now. 😂
More Cooking with yan plz
I stole how to prepare garlic from Martin Yan...it takes 1 sec and all he did was smash it with his cleaver...quick easy efficient and always hilarious when he was prepping. And always the "DONE!" at the end. Man is a legend.
I hates inflation to
Yan can cook watched and learn every week❤️
Taiwan….not a country!  Incredible social commentary Uncle Roger.    Social credit scores are coming when then do away with cash.
He's great ❤
Did he also host 'Wok With Yan'? Loved that show when I was a tyke.
I believe you were still unborn when the show ran in 80's....  Hey kid, you just keep searching about yan from youtube or some websites
The real master ❤. Still remember when Im still a small kid mostly watching cartoon, I will never missed  Martin Yan cooking show.  I never focus on the dishes he make coz small kid just eat mom’s food 😅 but I always enjoy watching his chopping & cutting  skill, how he smashed the garlic and ready to be used for his stir fry, how he julienne all the vege in no time, never get tired of his signature smile. Oh what a reminiscence 😊. Thank you Uncle Roger
Uncle Martin Yan is a godlike figure in the in culinary landscape — beautiful tribute to the OG Iron Chef — GOGOGO
i thought uncle roger was exaggerating a bit about the price of koshihikari rice... but hahaa wow 17bucks for 1 kilo dayummmmmm Uncle we need a discount code !!! ... > stil ordered 3 packs tho lol
When Star TV launched in India, in the beginning their programming was just their HK feed lifted and beamed directly to India…Yan Can Cook was something my mother and I would never miss - the dishes he would cook up, his knife skills, all of it was so fascinating!
Wok this way….don’t wok the boat…
As a Canadian Wok with Yan was my go too
0rgasm + food = Foodgasm << @uncleroger hahahaha
This was a terrific cooking show. I watched it religiously, as a child.
One of the main reasons i watched PBS as a kid
3 pixels
As a Taiwanese, I never heard a Mongolian beef, but "Mongolian barbecue" is form Taiwan. That article may have confused Mongolian beef with Mongolian barbecue.
yup 4-5x  inflation,  yet our wages are barely double of the 80s ....
Velveting & Shaoxing wine  (although a tiny bit of soda is also used in many marinades to break down the proteins a bit)
My dad used to watch Yan can cook a lot back in the 90s.
That was my show back in the day
i remember watching him when i`m still a child in my country , i alway wonder what his food taste like every episode i watch
Yan Can cook has over 3500 episodes..
😂wow you went back 😅😊❤
I used to watch Yan Can Cook all the time.
Back in the 80's Uncle Roger was just Cousin Roger
I loved the show,  my grandma had me watching all the shows , Julia child. Yan can cook, emerald, Alton brown ,og iron chef
I watched him back in the 80s and 90s. I was entertained to no end. Martin is definitely a classic!
I don't remember Yan but mum and dad had a Ken Hom book (he brought flavour to the UK!) I was v grateful to have a varied menu when growing up.
Cornstarch and baking soda to tenderise meat. It's called velveting
Thanks Uncle Roger for this! I loved Yan Can Cook and Wok with Yan as a kid! He inspired me togo out and bought a wok when I was about 10 years old to make his egg rolls and try other dishes.  I had forgotten about that til this video.
Uncle roger please spare your fans of your express vpn ads. PLEASE!
here we had wok with yan.
I loved watching Yan Can Cook with my grandmother.  Such great memories!  I still imitate him when I'm cooking sometimes. "And THEN!"
Wish You Good Morning towel !!!! Mr Yan, a true legend!
He blew Martha out of the water. Uncle Yan is king❤
I used to love watching this show! Yan is an Allstar!
WOK WITH YAN 🎉
I only watched this on rerun in 90s but I remember every Saturday at 10 am, me and my mom always watch this show
This man is a legend only msg ajinamato in China language smart move uncle roger
More like like 1880's people. The folks in that audience remember world war one
Uncle Roger should activate his ExpressVPN on his phone to avoid getting spied
I have never been so proud to say that my first rice cooker was Yan can cook's. I miss that rice cooker.
FUIYOH! I was born in ‘83 but I spent a lot of the 90’s with a dear friend watching uncle Yan re-runs on the Food Network. I’ve had him confused with Ken Hom for the last few years, which got me some strange looks when I used to talk about watching “Ken can cook” and this video has helped to clear the memory up!
Why uncle Roger is using the towel all the time?
18s u say damn your old
I remember when Amazon sold just books, because I loaded up on Martin Yan's books.
I loved watching Yan when I was a child. This man was such an inspiration to me to learn to cook in general. I hope you do work with him someday. That'd be wonderful to see! ❤
I learned how to cook asian food because I have had several bad experience at asian restaurants (always bad hygiene🤮) and asian food is really easy to prepare IMO
and let us remember... if Yan can cook...so can you! :D
Martin Yan is so famous in Vietnam, I loved his show Yan can cook when I was a kid.
This brought back a memory. My late sister was a cook. She cooked at a Chinese restaurant for several years and I worked there as a server for awhile. One day I was setting up for dinner, making rice, preparing garnishes, stocking the drinks fridge. She and another cook were chopping up huge carrots into julienne with cleavers. After a few minutes of the rhythmic chopping my sister broke into song "That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang..."  We all three had to stop working for a minute until we could stop laughing and get our breath. My sister went to the office to explain to the owner but the owner was still getting *her* breath back 😂
Taiwan have the artifacts of china so china have no artifacts to understand
Stur fry and stare fry lmao
How many subscribers for uncle rogers peking duck?
I love the Golf clap after he finished the each dish 😂
i've grew up watching .....and never lift my mind cuz i loved his way of cooking and his charming smile .
2:26 Nakama!!
You say it's not from Mongolia, China or Taiwan. WHERE DID IT COME FROM NOW tell uncle 😂
Met Martin purely by random chance my first week of Culinary School in San Francisco. He was recording a special at one of the cooking stores. He was the nicest person you could imagine. Let my friends and I hang out and watch the shoot. At the end he gave us some great tips and advice.
Uncle Roger using a "good morning" towel warms my Filipino heart. 😂
KQED YouTube channel has Martin Yan Episodes for those looking to support the show.
Yan Can Cook may very well be the first cooking show I ever watched on television.  Not to mention the early 2000s golden era of Food Network along with the original late night Iron Chef Japan.
I googled E621 to see what it was as a flavour enchancer at 6:31, do not google E621.
"Before Jamie Oliver" 💀
No "Sorry children" today? 😂
My friend from Taiwan told me it's Taiwanese. 😂
Yan can cook was the first cooking show I ever watched. You can tell he loves cooking food, and sharing it with others.
So happy to see this! I’ve always thought Martin Yan was conspicuously absent from Uncle Roger’s reviews until now.   Like others who’ve commented, I think a collaboration could be sublime, with a yin-yang dynamic between the two.  On one hand you have Martin’s all-smiles Public TV persona, peppering his cooking demos with Dad puns, and on the other hand we have… well, Uncle Roger, you’re kind of a punk (“Don’t just take random shit from cabinet and throw in food”).   If done well, outcome could be pure comedy gold…AND we could all learn some new culinary skills as a result.
My fascination with cooking in general but also anything that had to do with the Orient especially food, came at a very early age. I can tell you that in the very early 80s while most kids, (probably every kid ) was watching their beloved Saturday morning cartoons,  I was watching Yan Can Coook on PBS ... Martin Yan was a huge part of my childhood. He was my inspiration for becoming a chef. Love him to this day.
**That exwife towel throw**…. He needs to do it more often. Lmao. S cracked me the F up. 😂
LOVED Yan Can Cook!
There was also one cooking show 'WOK WITH YAN' it is with Stephen yan (my kitchen hero), another OG uncle from the 80s/90s
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook, this was very nostalgic, definitely the OG
Uncle Roger please do not forget to review “Wok with Yan”. Canadian cooking show in the 80’s
Uncle Roger mush see how Uncle Yan make fried rice: https://youtu.be/ZMoyrOfoRdw?si=zHGnYcP6S1bXLcEM
Was Yan can cook same with wok with Yan?
Martin Yan!!!! I loved Yan Can Cook as a kid growing up in the 90’s without cable. He’d be on that PBS Sunday afternoon cooking block, and he was so fun, funny, and made cooking feel so free and accessible. If Yan can cook, so can you!
My mother bought one of his cook books when I was a child and I absolutely loved it. She gave it to me 2 months ago and now my daughter absolutely loves it so I will be giving it to her when she is older. It's been in the family for 35yrs
Review Chicken Makhani Chef Sanjyot Keer my friend
The Good Morning Towel is a nice touch
I wonder if Uncle Yan is the equivalent of Bob Ross
Yan and Julia. The best PBS had to offer. Loved watching them make magic while i was growing up
In Canada we had Wok with Yan in the 80s. Every episode he wore an apron with a different wok pun printed on it like “MoonWoker” I’m sorry, but it was the superior show.
The nostalgia hits hard! Does anyone else out there still pretend to be Yan when you gotta chop vegetables?  🙋‍♀️
Wok on the wild side!!!
Yeah Martin!
I love Yan. I can’t remember if it was him who had funny tshirts with iron on letters. Although not actually affiliated I also thought of it as means to great cooking skills and loved the Great Wok of China infomercial. Apparently those go for a lot on eBay, I wish I got one back then.
Guarantee Orgasm 🤣.
"If yan can cook so can you"  Meanwhile me who made the most vile 3 am snack in the universe
🐫🐪challenge Mr Uncle Roger  Camel Fried Rice with 🍽️
I still watch Yan can Cook on YouTube to this very day.
If I remember right he’s from Hong Kong and came up thru the ranks. That is where he got his amazing knife skills.
I can't make Peking duck, but smoky chicken in a tortilla is sounding very, very good right now.
I watched Yan can cook, in NYC it was a bit of normal fare tbh. You could find the  ingredients if you had the tiome and there were restaurants right around the corner that had all that, but it was nice to think you could make it at home. Actually, calling a chinese food restaurant had the food at your door before you could hang up or so it seemed. Hang up...rotary or push button, but had a cradle and wall jack, you had to hang the phone back on its cradle to stop the call completely.
Can you make review for chef boy logro
Met him once, when we had him cook a Chinese New years dinner,  super cool guy, very low key.  The opposite of his TV persona
Now I just want to watch more yan can cook. I had four channels growing up, and pbs taught me how to cook
In Canada, we had Wok With Yan, he was very punny. You would like him, he had many wok jokes.  I didn't know about this guy.
Uncle roger need some AC 🤣🤣
Don’t forget “Wok with Yan”. Also a Canadian production but by Stephen Yan. He had the best aprons! Puns all day long!
Oh I thought the OG was Stephen Yan from Wok with Yan.
Yan can cook was awesome! Fantastic knife skills.
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook with my dad. He's still the GOAT.
Who remembers his father's show in the seventies?  "Wok with Yan?"....😊
The real OG trick is to put baking soda in your corn starch (or potato starch, whatever.)
甄文達大師確實係童年偶像
Cook it. Freeze it. Dry it. Roast it. Unclelogic. Unclelogic. 🎵
Great. Now I want some mongolian beef.
I used to watch wok with yan when I was a kid
I loved watching this man back in the day is the total OG❤❤
I heard a crow in the end
Yeyaaa has become a meme now
you need to find this guy and give him official uncle status
I own a Chinese cleaver because of Uncle Yan. I’ve had the knife so long the handle is older than Aunty Helen!
My Dad introduced Yan to me in person at our local Publix.
Davie504 mentioned you in a recent video of his... you should get him to make a egg fried rice video for you to review on here
This guy inspired so many children across the world to learn how to cook. Simply marvelous seeing and hearing clips from his show!
He was Canadian. I used to live a few blocks from his restaurant!
If Yan can cook, so can you..  Jamie: "YEEEEAAAHH"
Martin Yan is the OG. Watch him break down a chicken for his master class
Why the casual racism to white people.
I used to love his show when I was a kid!
We had a show here in Canada called “Wok With Yan” hosted by Stephen Yan from the 70’s and 80’s. He always had a wok based pun on his aprons and it was different every episode. It’d be interesting to see a review of his show too
Love Chef Yan!😍
Uncle roger use goodmorning towel 😂😂😂
California 2023 Peking duck $50
I learned to cook from Saturday PBS cooking shows.
Canadian here 🇨🇦 Yan Can Cook was a fave of mine as a little kid in the 80s. My love of cooking and Asian food endures today! 🙂
i'm from mongolia and this dish is not familiar in mongolia. i guess this is to other countries.
This is so sweet; Uncle Roger giving it up to the OG! 🙏🏽
I watched him as a young kid on PBS, I believe he is what sparked my interest in Asian cuisine and culture.
Uncle Roger, did you ever watch Wok with Yan???
I watched this as a kid too. There was a Canadian cooking show I remember called wok with Yan, but it was a different guy who just happened to be called Yan as well!
Uncle roger is the best youtuber in my opinion keep up the good work Uncle roger!
It's the first time i hear about Yan and he's awesome! :)
I LOVED watching Yan Can Cook! Always learned something new from him and my kids would stop playing when Martin Yang was on the tv he was so mesmerizing!
Check Wok with Yan
I got to meet him at a book signing. He is indeed a legend!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻☺️☺️🙏🏻
Uncle Yan is hot 🔥
Time to make my credit score go down (and hopefully Uncle Rodger's) there is no China, only West Taiwan.
I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Martin Yan when I was helping teach at a high school last year. He's still just as witty and charismatic as he has always been. He even took a picture with me. Nice guy, he was showing a variety of students how to make various dishes and adding a bit of his own pizazz to it.
I watched this show religiously with my mother. This is giving me flashbacks.
Uncle Roger…if you you’re going to review the classics you have to check WOK WITH YAN (with Stephen Yan). I like both shows but I always thought Stephen Yan was more entertaining. And Stephen used to go out a feed the audience to end the show. 😂
im pretty sure jamie son did tho 💀
When are you going to make Cambodia food video
I use to watch this with my grandma. She loved watching Yan even though she could only make southern American lol
I remember my aunties use to watch the OG Yan on tv growing up in the bay.
Watched Mr. Yan every week - great memories.
Loved this show!!!
I used to watch Yan Can Cook when i was a kid as well. So cool!!!!
I love Yan. I grew up watching him too. My mom learned to cook some dishes from him.
I remember watching Yan Can cook. I loved that show! Great vid, Uncle Roger.
I still go for the grand daddy of them all. Wok with Yan
uncle roger decided to have a self care day with this one
You FINALLY review my culinary hero. His iconic line "If Yan can cook, so can you!" Gave me inspiration as a kid
Is this the same person with WOK WITH YAN?
Loved his show growing up
I used to love watching Yan, frugal gourmet, Jacques Pépin, etc. back in the 80's
Me and my grandpa used to watch yan can cook, and if yan can cook. So can you?
Yan can cook!!
The other day I was cleaning out an apartment that the tenant left a bunch of trash in. There was a Zojirushi rice cooker box, and it was heavy. Got excited because I thought perhaps the rice cooker was in the box. Nope. Inside was an amorphous, jiggly blob of flesh tone silicone. I dumped it in the trash, and it turned out to be one of those 1/4 scale silicone ...dolls... just all jammed in there.
These Yan Can Cook clips are from KQED. We've loved working with Martin for so many years.
humm, pekin duck is an awesome food. One in Beijin is famous for it too.  Usually, they ask about the bone if you want it fry or soup after they platter it.
What he mean 80s white people there’s more Asian people there than white 7:16
next menu make peking duck please uncle!
Flavor enhancer E621. Yum yum~
My mom use to make this when I was 10yo
Seems like mu xu duck should be a thing?!
I would watch this 80s cooking show again and again.  I was born in 1972 so this is right up my alley.❤❤❤
I grew up with Yan on TV and we had the bestest Chinese restaurant that refused to "westernize" their authentic recipies, the 80's ROCKED for me as a youngling. <3
Your channel is like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs
I walked by Jamie Oliver pizza here in Mumbai. I felt my Italian ancestors cry.
Uncle title by default
From Fiji here and I can still remember Chef Yans slogan. One of the first Chefs who inspired me to do my own cooking. Glad to see this reaction.
The legend
Martin Yan was the reason I went and bought a wok in 1987. Watched his show every Saturday, along with the other cooking shows on PBS, and loved Chinese food and love to cook. Bought a wok and had tons of fun.
We didn't have Martin Yan, we had Stephen Yan on PBS around 1980 with "Wok With Yan", equally as entertaining. One of the shows I'd watch if I was home sick from school as a kid.
I thought the show's title was "Wok with Yan" but maybe that was another show.  Edit: Wok with Yan was indeed a different show! It was the one I grew up with.  This "If Yan Can Cook" is something I only discovered today. 😅
I remember watching Uncle Yan with my dad growing up and trying these recipes. No wok, but we made it work. These original cooking shows on PBS were some of the best.
The video has no sound
Martin Yan was the one cooking show I would always insist on watching... if Yan can cook, so can you too, turkeys! :D
Thank you for the weejio Uncle Roger! I am Canadian, and BEFORE Martin Yan, we had a show called "Wok With Yan", hosted by Stephen Yan (I don't think they're related). Anyways, I invite everyone to check out this video of the Canadian-Asian cooking show. www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTjwTieqhJY I personally think Stephen Yan is a lot more funny than Martin. Gotta love his aprons too!.
Yan is probably the only reason I was introduced to Asian cuisine as a child. I watched him religiously.
I already knew who it was just from the picture...  I use to love watching "Yan Can Cook".
True story, Yan does not have an accent.  It is just for the show.
When your tv only had two knobs (volume doesn't count 😂)... You know what channel he's on❤😂
Great Uncle Yan doesn't need approval but praise should all ways be given. I watched his show on PBS all the time; strait-up food porn, basted with charisma.
I apprenticed under chef Yan in SF at the California Culinary Academy / Le Cordon Bleu of San Francisco. He took us to a hardware store in China town, that turned out to be a forge for woks and cleavers in the back.  Most tools sold in the hardware store were hand forged in the back of his shop.
This brought back so much nostalgia.
Ken Hom next guy come on
Hey, I remember watching his show on Food Network back in the day. I used to love that channel. Mario Batalli, Emeril Lagassi, yes, even a bit of Rachel Ray. Of course Alton Brown.
Anti-whitism is especially funny when it is so obviously untrue. All the most desirable foods come from “white” people
Review WOK WITH YAN!!
You guys would have been best friends
God I loved watching his show. I think his show came on after the Galloping Gourmet when I was a kid.  Martin Yan gave me a love for Asian cooking from a young age
Lol wonder do your ex wife watch your videos and how she feel about you making jokes about her lol!
He’s not faking his accent tho unlike wack Rodger
House of Yu? House of Who?  No, not House of Hoo. House of Yu. House of Mi? No, Yu. Mi? Not Mi!!!!, YU!!!!!
OMG!  Yan was awesome!!!!!
Is that a good morning towel hahahhahaah
Love Martin Yan. Thank you for showing us all how to cook!🩷
Martin Yan is the reason I use a Chinese cleaver for everything. Fun fact he has not gained one pound since he did his first show. I’ve been dying to see you comment on one of his vids. Thanks UR!❤
I remember Yan Can Cook! I used to watch it sometimes as a kid. Yan is the Bob Ross of cooking shows.
I watched Martin Yan As a young adult with my mom on PBS I think, he has always been one of my very faves
My brother and I grew up watching Yan Can Cook. Definitely the OG of TV Chinese cooking.
I remember watching him debone a chicken in under 60 seconds
I love that you are constantly empowering great Asian cooks and chefs! I'd love to see a review or colab with of one my favorite cooks on YouTube Mandy @SoupedUpRecipes she is AMAZING!!
You weren't far off with your TV resolution gag... analog NTSC TV was codified as 720x480 (for DVD), which is 0.17 'K' :D
If this Guy still Alive, he needs to do a video with Uncle Roger
You should do a review of Wok with Yan. It was a similar Canadian show back in the day. (Probably a rip off of this one. We do that a lot.)
Man, Yan Can Cook was AWESOME!
Haha my ex wife
I grew up watching something like the Canadian version of this called Wok With Yan.
I loved this show.
Chef Yan was a huge part of my childhood. Chinese food plus a fun personality is a great combination. Respect.
Sometimes i feel so pathetic to be happy simply hearing the word "Taiwan" from any foreigner's mouth in any form. As a Taiwanese, that's how we have been bullied by the Chinese. Sigh.......
Please, do a collab with @LyannaKea
As a mixed Chinese I also believe Taiwan is not a country (fight me all you want I’m not going to change)
He is the OG for sure.
I loved watching Martin Yan!!!!! I remember watching him with my Dad (RIP) on PBS on the weekends!! I always copied him when he say “and you julienne, julienne…”
His cookbook is literally one of my kitchen treasures <3
Hey now uncle Roger!! MSG turns you into a communist.
I love his cooking show, since my childhood 😊😊
I grew up watching him with my mom! Yan can cook,and so can you!❤❤
“Inflation is bullshit.” One of my favorite Uncle Roger quotes.
Missing your old intro💔
Martin yan was the reason i wanted to learn to cook, his knife skills are unmatched.
Hoisin is the sweet part don't need sugar
That good morning towel 😅😂
How did America go from an authentic Chinese cooking show in the 80s to pretend Asian cooking show?
“Made with Lau” should also get the coveted uncle title. 😉
I smell a collaboration.
Me and my sister grew up with martin yan. He was the first tv chef I ever watched and it was great to see you give him some shine, Uncle Roger.   Just remember, niece and nephew: if yan can cook, so can you. :)
Uncle Roger should, if he is good,  secure a discount for his subscribers 😉
This is the show that introduced me to cooking shows.
Martin Yan was the inspiration for me becoming a chef, such an amazing man and chef. I remember the episode after his son was born they carried him on to the set in a giant wok so Martin could introduce him to the world.
I remember Yan can cook! I loved it, I remember Yan would cut himself accidentally while cooking
Uncle brought flavour before anyone else.   Ken Hom has left the chat..   Disappointed 😞
I used to watch Yan Can Cook and "Frugal Gourmet" with Jeff Smith. The nostalgia is real. 😂😂😂
I remember 2 shows growing up.  Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan.  Loved both shows.
Taiwan isn't a real country. it's a pawn and western dog territory who thinks it had more in common with its white overlords than its Chinese heritage
Yan cannnnnnn cook! <3 OMG love Yan!!!!
Do a wok with yan video uncle roger ❤
Unkil very funny
7:22 - Uncle Roger using the all-time Filipino favorite face towel - Good Morning Towel fuiyohhhhhhhhhhh
I have 3 of his books. His dim sum book is so helpful! Its hard to get dim sum where i live so i need it
taiwan real country
Uncle Roger u gonna get all the Malaysian Chinese get banned from many countries!!!😭😭😭 不要拉我们一起下水啊！
His cutting skill is crazy 😂 carving a chicken can be very fast
I remember watching this, the Cajun cook, and the frugal gourmet with my grandma as a kid.
About time!!!!!!
Ah, the memories. I grew up watching this show along with the Frugal Gourmet and Justin Wilson.
His first show was filmed in my hometown. (Calgary AB Canada) He was like a teen idol to little kids in my community.  We all believed he worked at KFC and excitedly looked for him any time we went there. 😂 (not sure if he ever did.... I couldnt verify on Google)
Taiwan numbawan
Discovered Yan Can Cook  around 1990 when we first got satellite TV. I was obsessed. He's a genuine legend.
Never missed Yan on Saturday on PBS. P. S. Get your A/C fixed ❤
Wow, what a callback! I used to watch his show all the time as a kid.
Thanks for bringing up this 80s show. It also brings my memories back when I watched this show with my grandma. It was simple and happy moment. Love it.
my husband and I LOVED to watch his show Yan Can Cook.
Best part they slit the throat just enough so the duck dies after blood drains.
This is taking me back to my childhood, when TV shows were actually good. Spending the Days of Our Lives watching As The World Turns and having a relaxing moment watching Yan Can Cook. Then there was Star Trek. People were more social, prices were still affordable, dating was a thing, and social media had yet to destroy society.
https://youtube.com/shorts/jwTDqhtwxvU?si=wiUxg89C50Ezv7yN
This man was so successful the Chinese named their currency after him.
Uncle Martin is the BEST Chinese chef ever. His style, his personality, and his cooking.
I feel so heart breaking when Uncle Roger said Taiwan is not a country. QAQ
Uncle roger For Real R
Uncle roger FR
Uncle Roger Zindabad
i loved watching this guy as a kid
One day Express VPN gonna sell their company to Uncle Roger 😂
Here in the Philippines🇵🇭, there is another way to cooked Peking Duck by using technique of Steaming and Deep Frying...
Yes .. this was indeed a famous show in India too, used to come on Star TV., and my dad loved watching so muchh,  If Yan Can Cook, so Can You ❤❤❤
I SCREAMED WHEN HE SAID MONGOLIAN HLEPP
Is that a good morning towel?
But I don't like Chinese food though.
1:15 Me personally I wouldn't take that disrespect
I used to watch Yan Can Cook ALL THE TIME when I was a kid!  Love that guy.
He was Canadian Roger…
Taiwan & social credit score joke is why Uncle Roger is...   Uncle Roger.
if your chopping sounds like a morse code that's how you know if you are good or not
Loved this video and Uncle Roger is too funny 😂
I know its old but gold! I just remember watching wok with yan when i was a kid.. nice humor, in your show.. keep it up..
Dude worried about getting cancelled for saying Taiwan isn't a country but says the 80s were 40 years ago 🫠
cleaver chopping sound always bring me memories of times that I visited my parents hometown. when mom, aunty and grandma group up to make foods for lunar news year.
"Inflation is bullshit."
There's no such thing as China, only West Taiwan
This “YAN CAN COOK” episode is very entertaining, funny, shows the diversity in Chinese noodle dishes: https://youtu.be/pl-DReHx840?si=XVVI2kIIwqwtUIIh
Good Morning towel! :D Fuhyio!!!
Martin Yan had the skills and charisma to make me watch a cooking show as a 10 year old. Martin Yan is indeed the OG.
I remembered when I was a young boy, it was very hard to watch his show during ramadhan.
Brings back memories. The thing I remember most is how he would make music while chopping. So funny.
When you see Jujutsu Kaisen on Japanese Netflix
Oh this is such a lovely memory. I remember watching him as a kid in the 90s
🇹🇼
5:32 you hear sizzling? I hear my ancester Cheering!!!
能不能有中文翻譯😢
My first time seeing Uncle Yan- what a absolute gem! of a person, just oozing passion and joy and wanting to share it!! Thank you for sharing with us too!
You missed that clip with Martin's second famous punch line.  "Always count your fingers, When you're done (chopping)"  FF to today, I work in the operating room and when I cart patients out of the OT, I tell on lookers, "always count your toes, when I'm gone". 😂😂
Is that Jackie ( the guy eating the duck )
omg “yan can cook” was my mom’s show when i was a kid.  you just brought back happy memories of my mom learning how to make asian cuisine.   martin yan and the vietnamese kids next door’s mom taught my mom a lot about asian cuisine
@uncle roger, is your ac broken? You were sweating the whole time 😅
peking burrito  goddamn you telling me mexicans stole their most iconic food from the chinese too?   why are the chinese so dope? they're awful but amazing what the haaaaiiiiil
Uncle Roger is going to make a Jamie Oliver marathon after this isn't he?
..
I hope Martin Yan and Uncle Roger can collab someday. They would make a good team
We also have an awesome uncle yan during our childhood:  Wok WIth Yan -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ7alH3WsK4&list=PLwWsMseqDSFO56sGbEkBEyBnyboxtyBgm
The way Uncle Roger reminisces about Chinese cleaver i think we found out what happened to Auntie Helen😮
OG?
HIV jokes?  Really?  Maybe reconsider that ....
The chopping make me c*m ah ah!!
25 seconds in and Uncle Roger already pull out Jamie Oliver
Koshihikari rice! <3
Loved this show as a kid! I met him irl at a home and garden show and he wasn't as pleasant. But maybe he was having a bad day. 🤷‍♂️ Still a legend though!
O my childhood!!! Yan Can Cook was one of the best compensations of being stuck inside on a rainy weekend back in the day.
When you going to cambodie
If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!! Brining in the small glass bowls before Martha and any tic toc !
Coming back every notif from you
Good on you Uncle Roger Taiwan is just a province of China 👍👍👍
I would watch a full series of Uncle Roger reviewing every episode of Yan Can Cook
OH YEAH THAT TAKES ME BACK, LOVE THAT GUY😁
Thank you, you just bought back a little bit of my childhood today.
Hi! The one i always remember was Mr. Stephen Yan. He was the OG "Wok with Yan" for me and yes this was in the 80's.
I remember watching his show "Wok with Yan" and the word wok was pronounced like they were saying "walk" as he would walk you through the steps to make some of the most delicious food.  I was young when his show first came out on cable, and I would watch for hours.  I think it's why I love Chinese food so much.
6:53 uncle Roger still doesn’t have an AC
Jamie Olive Oil got his inspiration from Uncle Yan's quote "if yan can cook so can Jamie"
Gyat dayum. Now that's a blast from the past. I remember watching him back in late 80's early 90's. Martin Yan is the sole reason i love cooking and eating good food. A really inspiring man. And remember guys, IF YAN CAN COOK SO CAN YOU!
Thank you uncle roger for not only making cooking funny and entertaining..but showing me how to properly prepare my fav kind of food the right way 😊 truly an inspiration and comedian.. one of a kind
Yan can cook was one of the greatest shows on tv. I loved this show i loved Martin Yan.
OG Martin Yan (thanks PBS!) _and_ Made With Lau shout out?! 🥰x 💯
He has the face of a man who has never eaten a Patrick Lam of Patrick’s Pies, pie.
https://youtube.com/shorts/th8BcsT27yk?si=B0IZWVEz66H3wb5Q Now he's uncle anndyyyyiii😂
this is very nostalgic...i remember watching this Sunday morning when I was in grade 4 which was 1994.....and I loved the Good Morning Face towel Uncle Roger...
I watched every single episode of his shows I could find on PBS as a kid. Just remember: If Yan Can Cook, SO CAN YOU!
Always mocking Jamie “Olive Oil Oliwer”🤣
Hoisin sauce with duck? strange combination, in beijing nobody eats duck like that
I’m from Mongolia and I don’t think my Khan loves spicy 🥵
When I was a kid I loved watching Yan Can Cook.
Even your towel is soooo asian. Good morning
Damn, Yan Can Cook is most famous cooking show in the asia at the time, it all over vietnamese tv in 2000s, love it until today
Fuiyoh original chef!
i used to watch his show
How come Uncle Roger didn't commend nephew for not measuring ingredients and just adding with FEELING?!!
War Su Gai. Gauntlet thrown. 😊
Taiwan is a country and Taiwanese food will blow your mind
Love this guy."If Yan can cook,so can you."
Next you need Aunty Elizabeth Chong from Aust still doing TV in her 90’s
i, too, was a young boy during the 80s but i remember another one who had a show called Wok With Yan.  I dont know if Martin Yan and Stephen Yan are related
This show was the reason my cooking journey started... love this show
Is he still alive?
uncle roger is a legend for using good morning towel in his wejio. Lots of love from Malaysia!! 😂❤
Uncle Roger can you please review Grandpas Kitchen😂😂😂
TAIWAN IS A REAL COUNTRY!!!!!
Chop chop chop .. see so easy
1:15 nice one 😅
Wok With Yan is amazing too!
I bet that shi bomb. You have an elder Unc.
I grew up with wok with yan! Omg the memories
Martin Yan is a legend same as Jacques Pépin and Mrs Child😁😁🤩🤩
I loved Yan Can Cook
I know Taiwan joke was for fun but as Taiwan decedent. We are a free country
Martin Yan is the BEST!! Dude instilled my love of Asian Food as a small child, and now I cook it as often as I can! (plenty of MSG of course!)
Yan Can Cook, my father used to record this in a VHS when he was still working in Hong Kong during the 90's then he brought it with him whenever he comes home for a vacation, sadly we live in the countryside so some of the ingredients that is almost impossible to find in our local market back then, now I can easily find these ingredients im gonna try one of his dishes this week.
The Taiwan bits made me laugh so hard.
11:33 what the hand xdd
Hayyaa, I just realized I'm uncle aged.
Martin Yan is a true treasure.  He lived nearby and his shows were all taped at KQED in San Francisco.  We taped some promos with him for a PBS fundraiser and I worked with his long time director Katharine Russell on several other shows.  He is also good friends with Larry Chu of Chef Chu's.   If you ever want the best Peking Duck in the United States, come to Chef Chu's in Los Altos, CA and yes you need to order the duck 24 hours in advance.   Instead of the wrap it is served on a steamed bun and it is out of this world, along with everything else served there.  I think you and Martin together would be awesome.  It should be a thing for a few episodes!
Parking duck originally should with sweet flour sauce
3:24 I busted a gut at the social credit score crack at 1:21, but the white membranes and seeds of peppers are what have all the spiciness, the colorful fruit portion has only a negligible amount of capsaicin. If you want your dish to be spicy, keep a lot of the white membrane and seeds.
In the 80's I'd watch Martin with both of my kids on PBS
Martin Yan is the person who got me into chinese cleavers. I really need to sharpen it.
Watching it as a kid in the 80s, and watching Uncle Roger's earthy reaction decades later, really reminds me how much time has passed. Culturally. In a good way.
Super - entertaining chef with a winning personality you'd just want to be around.  And I love that he used ordinary ingredients in a simple way, taking so much of the pressure and expense of finding odd ingredients off. Notice how he didn't even tell you what cut of beef or how to cut it.  No wild goose chases for ingredients maybe the ordinary person couldn't afford or wouldn't bother with.
MORE OF OG PLEASE
What a great tribute. I always enjoyed Martin Yan when I was trying to grasp basic cooking skills, and he always held a special place in my heart. His fantastic technique along with his you can do it delivery really resonated with me. He’s a master.
I learnt cooking chinese food from Martin Yan. His  catch phrase really inspired me. Thanks uncle Yan ❤
I grew up on this show too!  Also, all of the other ones on PBS at noon in the USA
OMG, I watched Martin int he 80's. Yan Can Cook!!
NO!!!!!!!!!!!  it wasn't  Martin Yan to first bring flavor to America it was his brother Stephen Yan (Wok with Yan)!!!! wok with Yan is way better than Yan can cook...
Used to watch this guy with my grams when i was a little kid. He was the best cook.
China loves it when you say Taiwan isn't another country because it's China's.
Why does Uncle Roger’s merch have to go so hard? It’s got no business being so fashionable 😑💅
I loved watching Martin Yan on PBS in the eighties. I enjoyed his humor and how he did the food. He made it look less alien and is a good reason for Asian food making mainstream wayback in the day. I still have his cookbook; The Yan Can Cook Book.
watched this as a kid as well, fun times, wide eyed kid watching all the chinese food on a wok.
I love the way you worked the product placement into other parts of the video, not so much that it was annoying, but enough that it would give people who skipped it FOMO and make them want to go back to see what they missed xD Never seen anybody do that before, hats off to you. And thanks for another brilliant video. Hope Uncle Yan sees this!
You can not get good Chinese food from a major chain restaurant. You need to go to a hole in the wall one that barley cleans its floor and have 35 cent gum ball machine at the door.
Another Chinese cooking great with a Canadian connection is Stephen Yan from “Wok with Yan”. Uncle Roger should check him out. He had great “dad” humour. Martin Yan spent time teaching cooking and appearing on Calgary TV before making his PBS show.
If Roger can joke, so can you.
Interesting & fun facts; the real OG TV chef named Yan was Stephen Yan. Funnily enough, aside from the same name & skill set, they also have the same sense of humour, very punny.  Stephen's first TV series was made in Vancouver, BC, & was called Wok with Yan. Every episode he wore an apron with a new pun using the word wok. Martin also got his start on TV in Canada, guesting on a talkshow in Calgary, AB. Martin actually worked for Stephen & i can't help but wonder if he followed Stephen's lead on fitting punny humour into his shows. They are both great, but i have a special place in my heart for Stephen. I remember the anticipation at the start of every episode, waiting for him to reveal the day's joke apron.  It's silly, but, as a Canadian, am kinda proud Canada can lay claim to both of these funny, talented chefs. BTW, your ".... you're Peking my interest." comment was worthy of both Yan punsters. 😆
Uncle Yan is amazing
so good! best video/content uncle roger! finally got a review for an ancestor/legend as martin yan, and i really do hope you can have a collab with him! and even gordon one day too!   "if you combine corn starch with msg fui-yoh guarantee orgasm" funniest line EVER cuz us chinese americans get why this is true. add hoisin sauce and you'd have multiple ><
I LOVED YAN CAN COOK!
Time to review daddy laus dishes - he’s not uncle status. He’s like grandpa status 🫡
This was my introduction to Chinese cooking in the 80s…Wok With Yan.   https://youtu.be/c3oQYzM9aBA?si=i5bCTi2W-ZVhAu39
Uncle Roger never mention that Uncle Yan use “real fire”, not 1980’s coil electric stove top. Always use real fire when cooking with wok!
I used to watch tan can cook when I was little
Still no air conditioner, HAIYAA  🤦
Martin Yan is a fellow YouTuber!
I remember watching an episode of his program where he was cooking shrimp and he cut the heads off and set them aside for later.  When he got around to where he needed them, he said, "now that's cooking a head..."  Loved Yan Can Cook.
肉品制嫩其实不是靠淀粉，而是靠盐，，当然淀粉可以在这个基础上进一步帮助肉品吸水，使之变得更嫩。
Pls review palabok cooking plsss
I met Martin Yan.  I have a cookbook signed by him.  He was a great person.  My sons name is Devin, as his is.
Omg. Nostalgia sia. Watching Martin Yan cooking after school when i was in primary school.😂😂😂
Martin Yan is the asian version of Jamie Oliver but better, just saying
i only watch his show one time and it only like really old in around 20010 to 2011  it a great show
Also loved Wok with Yan
Social credit +999999
I remember one show Yan used a dead goldfish as a plate decoration .....Why Yan, why?
Ghengis Kahn and his 1000s of women. His DNA , after 750 years,  is found in 0.5% of world population.
For 20 years I only owned a cleaver for chopping and slicing because of Martin Yan.
Duck carcass soup fuiyoo
I love this guy, he has a restaurant near my house called Yan's garden in Coquitlam, BC
I grew up in Canada and Yan can Cook was first filmed there. It was so popular! My mother would take notes. Thanks for the memories.
Nowadays, you can still enjoy delicious peking duck in Hong Kong and you can go to Peking Garden for it.
Yes the one that taught me how to make wontons,fried rice,egg rolls, steamed pork dumplings and general tso chicken. I loved his show and watched it all the time with my mom and dad.
Yan sure Can Cook, But My favourite show back then was Wok With Yan!
I remember watching him cook with my dad, and always remembered "If Yan can cook, so can you!" Made me want to be a chef but never followed through with it.
Twain not even real counti🤣
Yan Can Cook was a bonding show for me and my Gran! Loved watching Martin Yan!
I used to watch him all the time!
MY FAVORITE ASIAN CHEF OF ALL TIME!!😍❤️😍
Peking Duck taco or burrito.
PBS cooking shows taught me how to cook. My brother-in-law is from Taiwan and his parents owned a Chinese restaurant when he was younger. I mentioned making fried rice and he was shocked that it was similar to how his mom made it. He asked where I learned to make it. "Yan Can Cook and Graham Kerr". Frugal Gourmet was also a favorite, but he's problematic
I don’t have many bits of memorabilia, celebrity autographs, etc. But of the few I have, my most prized is a cookbook (The Yan Can Cook Book, 1981 by Doubleday) and photo taken of me with Uncle Martin when I was about 7. It’s attached inside the cover, next to a little message he scrawled out for me when we were at a cooking demo at a local department store, and I’d been chosen to participate. He was the funnest to watch, and was very kind and excited to meet such a small fan. And while I don’t recall what we made that day (tomatoes, green onions, and probably tofu were involved), I know for a fact my love affair with Asian noodle dishes began with him.  My second favorite quote of his came during a show where the audience was invited to hand pull noodles alongside another guest master chef. “That YOUR mess, you clean it up!” Now please excuse me, I need to bang out some tunes with my cleaver and chopping board (for reasons), and whip up some SF style garlic noodles. 🍜 🙏🏼
Yan can cook!!!!
Oh snap, shot fired at Jamie Oliver 😂 😂 😂
I loved watching Yan can Cook when I was a kid it was funny
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook on KQED PBS station.
No sugar, not all white people eat sugar.
yeah, martin yan is a badass chef with a knife  check out julia child cutting onions. I think it was her french onion soup; I know it's french, but she is such a badass cutting onions yo!  like watching your grandma tell you a bedtime story while punching chuck norris in the balls.
Wok with Yan
$120 for a whole duck is still a decent deal.
That wasnt the sound of chopping, That was Morse code getting message sent back to the Motherland
I grew up with Yan can cook
I love how when he added hoisen he didn’t say shit
PBS weekend mornings with Yan Can Cook and Julia Child - they were my childhood inspirations! Later I graduated from culinary school… I’m not a chef anymore, but if Yan Can Cook, so could I!   (I got to meet him once when he was touring and taste his soup… dream come true!)
Use to Watch his show too. If Yan can cook, so can you 😊🎉
Love it! I grew up on Yan Can Cook back in the 80s. What a legend! 🤟
he is one of my childhood culinary heroes. if yan can cook so can you!
You make me want to have a wok, please give me a good brand for me to buy so I can cook with a wok. Thanks, Uncle Roger.
In Canada we watched Wok with Yan. The original Uncle Roger's.  https://youtu.be/PTjwTieqhJY?si=UNUNpaU0iXgbCglp
Lmao @the bloopers
My guy started sounding like a crow at the very end 😂
Uncle Roger, are you going to call Uncle Yan, Wok Fok boy or are you going to apologies to Gordon Ramsay? Because least I checked you gave shit to Ramsay for having 2 wok's and here Uncle Yan is using 3 wok's. 🤔😁😂
Yan's best quote was 'don't wok the boat!' when he went fishing once. It might have been put on an apron for him? Anyway, I still remember that comedy gold.
Watching martin yen with my dad is one of my childhood memories 🥹  Dude is so uplifting, his chopping and tossing is not something you normally see at a kitchen back then.  I remember just waiting for him to do something unexpected, like slipping the chopped ingredients to the plate, it's almost like magic!   Truly the OG of not just asian cooking, but cooking in general
Man, I loved watching Yan Can Cook. Sunday's late afternoon. You are an official 歹徒 for this.
I used to watch Martin as a child LOL damn Uncle Rodger do you really have to tell my age. Let's just say I'm a 90s girl
Saw Martin at dinner party, he is really fun to talk to.
Thank you for bringing this gem to us young people.
Looks so good. 😺😺😺
Corn Starch and MSG...sounds like Uncle Roger going to be breaking bad....
OMG I remember watching reruns of this man with my grandmother. Like what Uncle Rodger said it was definitely simpler times then.
GO SHOOT A LIMIT OF DUCKS, TAKE 2 IN & GIVE THEM 1 & THEY WILL COOK THE OTHER FOR YOU FOR FREE! SAME WITH ANY FISH!
Love Wok with Yan
Only uncle Roger can twist the Martin out of people😂
If you want to review another vintage asian tv chef, why not Ken Hom ?
The dance he did after saying he likes the music killed me😂
Hell yeah paying respects to the og.
Being Canadian,  i grew up with 'wok with Yan'! Never heard of this guy before, hahaha!
Yan Can Cook was so awesome. For a small town white girl with some serious food dislikes as a child, Asian food seemed so mysterious and unusual and Yan made it all so accessible and easy to understand.  We had so many white people cooking European food, and he opened up the cooking world to so much more.
That "Good Morning" face towel really radiates asian energy. Fuiyoh!
I loved this show when I was a kid!
Wok with yan is the og og
4-5 year old me never missed a chance to see Yan when he came on, on my local PBS station he was right after Seasame Street and at first my mom would try to change it over to some other kids' show but I always threw a fit, I LOVED Yan Can Cook. I didn't grow up to be a professional chef like I wanted, but he helped me to be a pretty good home cook!
But Didn’t the french person  Say Bidenomics has ended inflation?
Yan Can Cook is LEGENDARY! My dad and I used to watch this show all the time. He's gotta be the Uncle of all Uncles!
Martin Yan is why I started cooking. That was almost two decades ago (PBS reruns when I was a kid) and now, I can make almost anything.
OGs are the best! Happy 8 million Uncle! ❤
I lost it when he called the Peking man his ex-wife.
Holy crap! My parents used to try to recreate Yan Can Cook recipes back in the 80's. They loved him!
This and working in a Chinese kitchen in HS ignited my passion for Asian cooking that I still do to this day (with MSG!) Respect to Uncle Roger giving respect to the OG, Martin Yan
😂😂 Uncle will not miss a chance to shit on Jamie Oliver
Pekin duck = Tacos No wonder he's happy eating it
Awwwww.....I miss Yan!!!!! He made me think i could cook...lol. I mean, I can cook, but not like Yan Can Cook!! 😅
🔥😮👍🏻
ex wife joke was wildin
I even have authentic Martin Yan brand cleaver in my knife block, use it all the time.
Make Hong Kong free again
"If you chop onion fast enough, no time to cry"
I showed my niece a weejio of Uncle Martin show from the 80s and he fileted a bell pepper with the Chinese cleaver. I mean he cut the bell pepper so thing the piece he held up was see through and my niece was just like "😳😦But How?! HOOOOOWWWWWW?!?!" And now she has become hooked on watching his old shows too
I loved watching and learning from him. It was a honor actually :)
I remember watching Yan Can Cook, Frugal Gourmet and Justin Wilson growing up as a kid.  From watching them and later watching Alton Brown is most of where I learned to cook meals.  Mom taught me how to bake pastries, but a bunch of dudes with tv shows is how I learned to make a decent meal.
Uncle Yan is one of the GOATs
Loved watching this show as a kid.❤❤
I remember I actually met yan  in utah when I was about twelve
"If Yan can cook, so can you!". ❤
Yes! I loved Yan Can Cook! It was one of the first cooking shows I remember watching on PBS when I was little. Martin Yan is amazing!
I couldn't remember where I learned my cleaver smack... Watching this now I realize it was Martin Yan! :)
I grew up watching this man. My mom always knew when my dad and me were watching it because we always wanted Chinese food after
Yan was the shit! I still watch his shows lol
My sister got me a Cameo from Chef Yan for my birthday and it’s a fucking Treasure.
He has been around a lot in the bay area recently
alright UR I will come back for this. Martin Yan was my damn childhood. all that "big knife" stuff, loved it.
One thing about American Chinese food was a group of Chinese immigrants got together and developed recipes that would appeal to Americans so that they can make themselves a living.   PBS in the USA often has some of the best cooking shows. This is where we saw Yan Can Cook
One of your better videos my friend truly in a groove I could tell you becoming more sexperienced really enjoyed all the positive attitude.  Hyyyya!!!!!
Them social credit score jokes killing me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just heard from official channels that Uncle Roger is now banned from ever entering Taiwan, my beloved Formosa.
Oh man. This is NOT the OG. Stephen Yan from Wok with Yan is the grand master OG. You need to check him out. Yan vs Yan. Yan wins.
37 seasons 😮
Yan is a childhood hero, I was inspired to cook by that man.
He has his own channel: https://youtube.com/@ChefMartinYan?si=-u0myTXDVZ2JKKG0
Pretty sure I saw you outside Kings Cross yesterday but didnt fancy saying Hi just incase I'm more racist than I thought and it was just a random asian dude
Besides  Martin Yan's show, there was also another cooking show called Wok with Yan with Stephen Yan
Martin Yan is legendary. You should review his video on how to debone a chicken; it's hillarious, and there's multiple videos online of him doing it.  He was the one who put me on my path to my lifetime obsession with Chinese food :)
You took me back to the great 90s 😢😢
I really love Matin Yan as well when he also had show in Hong Kong TV. He does the Chinese cuisine in the right and traditional way.
I used to watch Yan can cook.
That ad transition was phenomenal 😂
my father did some home improvements for uncle Yan in the 90s. He said Martin is a very nice guy.
I'm old enough now that I remember watching this on PBS and it was one of my favorite shows as a kid. "If Yan can cook; so can you!!"
Yan Can Cook is my childhood. I don't think I was even old enough to cook by myself, but I would watch his show religiously.
I used to watch Yan can cook as a kid. I loved the way he would smash garlic with his cleaver and yell "done"
Yan Can Cook is the fucking man!!! True legend. Also shout out to Made With Lau, another great cooking channel!
SOLIDARITY WITH MY TAIWANESE MOOTS lovely widjeo uncle
I met Martin Yan. Very nice man.
https://youtube.com/shorts/EOUP-WgNiNA?si=Yk1alerEoOnA0XDQ
Uncle Roger fangirling over his childhood crush
Another 80's show was "Wok With Yan"  Filmed in Toronto.  I would love to see Uncle Roger check out Mr. Yan
Tuala good morning
Oh my gosh! I feel so old! I haven't thought about him for ages, but I loved him so much! Never missed an episode growing up! 😢  He is probably in my subconscious creating the intrusive thoughts like 'Put the hoisin sauce on the Thanksgiving turkey. Nobody does it, but it won't be wrong.'  (Spoiler alert: it isn't wrong. It's good)
Fuiyoooooh! Uncle Roger you have move up a new funny.  HIV & MSG! 😂😂🤣👍👍 Never heard of that and it’s brilliant I must say.
Uncle Roger has brought back memories with Martin Yan. But I'm Canadian... I grew up watching Wok with Yan. Stephen Yan was the OG OG Yan. I wonder if Uncle Roger has ever seen or would watch a Wok with Yan show? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok_with_Yan
And THEN!!!
Martin Yan is the alpha Uncle. He's the Uncle of all other Uncles.
Excellent video. Thanks dude.
Martin Yan introduced the western world to the Chinese fajita.
I would like to see you review  chanel "My name is Andong"😊
I met Martin Yan at my culinary school’s graduation ceremony. Such a good human being. He even told me the secret to a delicious Xiao Ling Bao. Just the Best! I hope Martin and Uncle Roger can do a collaboration.
The Original One Piece is the Best. Just like MSG. FUIYOH!
Yan Can Cook on PBS, man theres some memories, still one of the best cooking shows.
Martin Yan was my childhood.    I watched Yan Can Cook religiously in my youth. Thank goodness for PBS, man…
I used to watch Yan Can Cook when I was a kid during the 80s. Usually because his show would be on around Bob Ross' show.
Oh man I love e621
I really hope Uncle Roger get ban from Taiwan
It'd be fun for Uncle Roger to react to another Yan Can Cook episode
Used to watch Yan Can Cook almost everyday in the 90’s with my mom 👏
I used to watch Yan can cook as a youngster. Love that guy. I think I've seen every episode atleast twice.
More videos like this
OMGOMGOMG, I love "Yan Can Cook"!! He'd always say, "so eeeeaassssyyy!" I'm glad you did an episode on him. <3
uncle roger watching hells kitchen would be phenomonal
Have you ever done an episode with "Simply Ming"
I lived in Myanmar, a third-world country with a strict connection with the rest of the world. Yet I still remember his catch phrase "If Yan can cook, so can you". Legend!
Peking duck tacos!
Hey Uncle Roger, can you review various kinds of instant fried rice seasonings from Indonesia with various brands? and which one will be your favorite later
“not a real country” Nice one dude！
Uncle Roger in 2100: *every countries ban him*
Martin was a customer of the CompUSA I worked at back in the 90's, and turns out his accent was just as legit as Uncle Rogers.  It was a character he was playing on TV.
I once saw Mr. Yan make a raw chicken dance as he chopped it up. Truly a delight and a master in his craft. :)
Thank you for featuring Martin Yan. I grew up watching him in the 80s in Trinidad. So many people don't know this awesome man. You've inspired me to go back and watch his old episodes.
Wok with Yan , tell me if you even know this old tv show from the 80's
You want OG, you should look for Wok with Yan videos. I think that came out before Yan can cook.
I grew to watching this guy on Food Network. Loved him.
Taiwan is a country UR! But I forgive you:)
Roger doesn’t lie. Peking duck is hella expensive, especially for the whole duck, it’s $45 if slice it for you
.MedMen Stock Running Up Now. Health Services Directing DEA to reschedule Marijuana! Buy MedMen Stock Today!! Mmnff..........
The Peking duck music is lit af
Uncle Roger re-introducing Uncle Martin Yan?? WHOO HOO!!!!
Not much cooking in this fried rice video! But I can just imagine your take on this 😂😂   https://youtube.com/shorts/hXAJg1eIxFI?si=-fb2FZJpWCn9PpBP
Wow. Uncle Roger using Good Morning towel 😂
Uncle Roger should do an episode with James May
Uncle Roger Social Credit gone up 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 OMG I just can't 😂😂😂
Taiwan is not a country  as per that China is not expanding
I like that towel. That’s so old school 😂. Only if you living in Malaysia or Singapore.
Martin Yan has the energy and personality that Jamie Oliver wishes he had.
It will be a great video if Uncle Roger go to a Jamie Oliver restaurant!
how old are you uncle roger?
Every Saturday morning. I would get angry that Yan can cook would come on. Now before you Haiyaa me, You gotta remember. I was 8 years old and really wanted to watch cartoons. However, he was the reason I grew to love Asian food at a young age.
Why did you show me your ex-wife?
Loved watching him as a kid
You should do a review on Yan Can Cook's 80s Canadian counterpart Wok with Yan.
I always watch Master Yan cook too uncle Roger.. since young...   I like both of u 😌
Uuuuuu china taco !!!! Nice ......
Fukushima rice...........never buy food products from japan..........never forget .....always remember
So funny.
House of Yu!! 😂
I definitely remember watching him on TV on PBS. My mom and I used to watch him and would always enjoy his cheesy jokes and chopping techniques
Ayaaa i come in the youtube and Uncle Roger is there on the first page Hayaaa
Man I never knew about this guy, he’s like Uncle Roger but way better at cooking.
can you get him on you channel? do a fried rice.. lol
bro did a 180 for the sponsor ship
One duck.. Threeeeeeee dishes!
No comments about Taiwan here
He was one of 3-4 cooking shows I regularly watched on PBS as a kid in the 80's.  Back before the Frugal Chef flew into the side of a mountain, and Julia and Jacques were doing shows.
Learned lot from martin yan,  and Mongolian beef my favorite, but the beef and scallions from China, I add onions too and it's my Mongolian beef lol
Uncle Martin is so OG he predates Jackie Chan learning passable English.
I adored watching Yan Can Cook with my parents!! Him and Justin Wilson helped make me love to cook when I was a child.
Yuan is the best! I remember the "stir fry not stare fry" joke from when I was a kid and I think of it every time I heat up my wok. That man is a legend.
Please please please try and do a collaboration with Yan Can Cook! My favorite cooking show back then. I remember when he brought out his twin babies in two large woks with lids and showed then to his audience. 😅😂😂
In Canada we watched "Wok with Yan", he was really funny
Can you LOVE Uncle Ken Hom next?
台灣現在變成流量密碼了😂
Not sure what Chinese food is. That said, I think this video covers some great Western Taiwanese cuisine.
He only said that about Taiwan because Y E A H...
He has a youtube channel, which, i am sure you already knew
Lonny Gerungan is the OG Indonesian tv chef https://youtu.be/qXNzhfHcQR8?si=-4tqf3-IvxJBptMY
i loved Yan can cook
watched this show every day. Yan was THE Man!!
Exaggerated Chinese accent he doesn't naturally speak.  I see how Martin Yan was an inspiration to Uncle Roger.
Thanks Uncle Roger.  I have loved Martin Yan forever.  He was not only a great cook but a great entertainer.
Love how he measure his ingredients with feelings
This was in the nineties uncle Roger. Hiyaa!
As a descendent of Genghis Khan I can confirm that he liked his women wild and spicy 🔥
UNCLE ROGER PLEASE ANSWER THIS COMMENT IF YOU DO MY DAD WILL BUY ME A RICE COOKER AND I REALLY WANT/NEED ONE 😊😊😊
Who doesnt love himm...I knew him since i was a child through tv ..He always say If yan can cook you can cook too....😂
Yan Can Cook vs. Wok With Yan! Two Canadian TV icons. We need a comparison episode.
This is way before everyone got allergies
Haiay
This comment section is so wholesome. Hopefully we can get Uncle Roger and Uncle Yan together on a video
I became a chef BECAUSE of Yan Can Cook (My great grandma & I would watch together every summer - along with Galloping Gourmet)! My favorite cuisine is Asian because of this man... and I was taught Asian Cooking in culinary college by the amazing woman doing all the work behind the scenes for Yan's Show (Chef Rhoda)... Yan made me happy & taught me that you can do anything you put your mind to! :) Thanks for the Flashback Uncle Roger! :)
I would be curious to see more review like that , ancient wisdom is always the best
To me they are the same people
Will there be Uncle Roger and Uncle Yan collab coming?
I loved this show growing up!
😂😂🤣🤣 Taiwan not even country 😂😂😂😂 true
taiwan觀眾在這！
gosh.... nobody talking about the good morning towel Uncle Roger used?🤣🤣
This is sure brings back lots of memories ❤
YAN CAN COOK AND SO CAN YOU ❤❤❤❤
Loved Yan Can Cook when I was a kid - learned from Yan and Julia!
I love the Martin Yan YTP videos. Long noodles equal long shit!
☺♥
Setting Jamie Oliver's son up now for some trolling, classy  stuff uncle rog.
Wow! I grew up to watch all his show and I even cooked his recipes.. Best cooking show ever. ❤
Hi Uncle, amazing video as always, I didn't know this show, and as you say, it looks really friendly. In this weejio you seemed very proud and happy of Martin's show, I loved that. If you make reviews of 80s-90s cooking shows a regular thing, I absolutely support that!
One of famous cooking show, and his famous quote "If Yan can cook, so can you"
This video is full on information too, the history of the food and also express vpn
No you sound like him that why you the Goat of msg 😎
What a great show, I remember watching Yan Can Cook as I was starting to learn to cook as a teenager.
Chef Martin Yan is a Living Legend! ❤
Cleaver chopping best ASMR
I mean if you prepare the ducks everyday then you can serve them everyday no?
I see two woks he a wok fuck boi
Wouldn’t it be astonishing if uncle Roger actually try to every dish that he criticized. Lol. I’d like to see him squirm 😂
Ok the social credit score joke was a good one 😂
I loved watching his show as a kid!
Yan can cook, so can you. My childhood memory tv show. 😂
Uncle roger Jamie Oliver has a restaurant in Dubai
Martin Yan! My childhood! And I'm from all the way in Sri Lanka on the other side of the world. 😂That chopping was the world's first ASMR!  If Yan can cook, so can you! 🤩
@Uncle Roger,  You have a scammer replying to people in the comments pretending to be you.
Finally legend 🎉
Yan can cook and wok with yan....
Too bad about M.Y. Asia closing so quickly.
Uncle Rogers, please review the old cooking show, "Wok with Yan" (On tv in the 70s/80s) i used to wake up every morning at 5am (that's the time slot it was on for re-runs i think) to watch. Was fun to watch. Can still find it on YouTube lol the quality is mediocre and ancient but its an entertaining show. 🏯⛩️🍣🥢🧋@uncleroger
KQED on YouTube has a whole bunch of his episodes
I know that small white towel...
yea, inflation is so bad these days, thats why I commit tax evasion! Edit: i do wish to cook with Nigelng, so i can cook some truly good an flavorist food! rather so called noodles! hell all noodles, i can manage to buy does dont include MSG! its all vegan crap >:( it is sad days :( flavor where i am at does not exist
Please review Indian chef also like ranveer brar and yfl
Is this the first time Uncle Roger never talked shït about the person he review? 😆  Anyway, nice video as always
Not only is the show from the 80's, but with an audience with ages to match.
What a weird coinsidence I found a random app on my fire stick that has old cooking show and it has a ton of martin yan and ive been watching him quite a bit hes a great chef
4:11 똑똑똑똑똑똑
OF COURSE uncle Roger respects the goat Good taste knows good taste
Heeey Made  with lau in there I dare u react to his fried rice with fresh rice jajaj just bashing ppl saying meh if u not skilled enough u need day old rice
You can also use Hoosin paste.
KaK Kak
អាKak
Garlic in too early
More like 6 to 24 hours for any marinade
Hoi Sin sauce also got sugar
Does Uncle Roger always sweat so much after insulting the Chinese government?
OG face towel. It reminded me of my elementary days 😂😂😂 still famous here in 🇵🇭
The famous Good Morning towel!
greeting from Hong Kong!
I like your “祝君早安” towel, definitely a must-have for an Asian uncle.
The Koshihikari showing up on this video is the one made in my hometown Toyama!! Fuiyooo Thank you so much uncle roger for choosing it, I'm so proud of our koshihikari which can only make you feel orgasm
My favorite show growing up 😁😁
Nice 'Good Morning' towel Uncle Roger! +1 social credit score from Malaysia😆
corn came from asia? where did the corn starch come from for the authentic foods?
"Why you show me picture of my ex wife?" lmao
🤣😂👍💪❤
Watching Yan Can Cook was a thing we did as a family during the weekends. We loved how happy he was and how simple he made cooking Chinese dishes. Loved watching his show.
Yan Can Cook is the misguided US version of famous Canadian 70s and 80s cooking show Wok with Yan … just like 90210 was Aaron Spelling’s misguided American version of Degrassi…
Note to editor: the transition @0:36 is bad. Fix it next time.
I remember Uncle Yan. I think. Was ages ago
OMG! I grew up watching Wok with Yan! It's one of my  most fave tv shows
80s were HIV and cocaine, then msg
"Yan can cook" common phrase whenever someone surprises us by cooking (well) ahhh been a good min, thanks for the nostalgia uncle roger
-“If Yan can cook, so can you” -Jamie Oliver:
Why does the duck slicer guy's face looks familiar to me? hmmm.
as a Malaysian, you should study form 1 history, peking man was in there :)
I love the fact that Uncle Roger just comes out right off the bat with a tw joke.
I am always excited when Uncle Rodger is excited. So infectious
is all about legends this time ...Yan Can Cook and 祝君安好 towel 😜
there is a hell's kitchen episode with Martin Yan, I saw him first in that video
then don't be pussy, come to Taiwan for show XDXDXD
My first time seeing chef Yan, can we have Ken Hom next Uncle Roger
Taiwan is a real country!!!!!!!
The man is 74 yrs old. You best get on it if you want to cook with him.
Can you give him an uncle title?
Gangis khan Chinese hai?
I was born in 1977. I wouldn't say I grew up on Yan can cook, but I t was something I would actively try to watch, even though I hated cooking back then. He was entertaining and, at least to me, honest.
Uncle Roger, can you make me an egg?
"Uhh, Why u show me picture of my ex wife?" 🤣🤣
Used to watch him as a kid in Indonesia. But the show called cook with Yan, I think. He would at the end of the show start to give away his cooked food to the audience in the front. I always wanted to be that audience 😂
ah! the memories!
As a malaysian..i remember watching Martin Yan on tv as a child and was so amazed by his skills and his persona.
hey this show was aired in  philippines during 80s its my mom and dad fave show xD
Master Yan sending code morse with his chopping: "Taiwan not even country-STOP- Taiwan not even country-FULL STOP"...
Yan can cook is legend.
The chopping skills, respect Yan, much respect !! So satisfying listening to that chop 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😍
Uncle Roger needs an AC 😭
Uncle can you say how to do vpn ? Vpn is more likely ilegal. Hmmm i hope all good
🇭🇰 Hong Kong
Cleaver chopping was morse code for MSG
I had the oportunity to assist chef Martin Yan when he did a cooking demo here in manila he was very nice even gave us some of his left over ingredients that are very rare and expensive here in the philipines he even tought me how to cook the hk style baked porkchop 😊😊😊
That one line of “stare fry” is bigger than Jamie Oliver’s whole career
Uncle Roger, you may wanna make it a point saying you won't diss Jamie Oliver's son. Not just because he's Jamie's son, so the work is already done for you, but because he's 12, and there's still time for him to change before it's too late.
This man is a legend, I remember coming back from Primary School every afternoon to turn on TVB Pearl channel in Hong Kong to wach his show, he's the reason why I love to cook.
Wow that guy oozes positivity and motivation. Would love to see a mashup between himself and Frank Proto.
OMG! You just took me right back to my childhood. I'd completely forgotten this show. Thank you!
Uncle Roger must be  SWEATING hearing that cleaver chopping 😅
he rocks
3:34 lmao especially considering the fact that spicy peppers weren't introduced to the old world until 300 years after Khan's death
Martin Yan is a legend! Review Keith Floyd next please!
china granted uncle roger higher soc cred score bcuz he was saying taiwan isnt a real country
jamies pizzeria on the gold coast QLD Australia just closed down
Yan didn't cook to show off his skills, he cooked to inspire us. A legend
Martin Yan is and will always be the GOAT!
Enjoying the cleaver morse code asmr! Knife skills are epic..
Still no Air-Con
Wok with Yan by Stephen Yan was also amazing!
YanCanCook was the first cooking show I watched. It was in my childhood but still fresh in my memory, YAN coming to the show in a limosin was the intro of the show. I used to watch it with my mom. Now that I think of it, this show is the og show which inspired me to watch food based contents all my life.  I love this show. the rhythmic  chopping sound still invokes strong nostalgia from my childhood.
Hoisin sauce is so concentrated,so it’s very close to an msg substitute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0h1aOebTgw
1:15 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
where did you buy that good morning towel?
Martin Yan .. how i learn to cook from his cook show
Ahhhhh i remember "if yan can cook, so can u!". Thank u for making me remember my childhood lol
OMG I remember "Yan can cook". He was so great. " Look at dis ", "Look at dat". Was best show
Now we need to see uncle roger review some of Keith Floyd’s dishes!!
Malaysian here. I remember watching Wok with Yan growing up. So cool.
1:10 Correction➡️ "Taiwan" isn't a name of country actually It's actually an island with _Republic of China(ROC)_ on it (not PRC, that's China Mainland, and not even ROG, since that's gaming device Devs from ASUS
Yan Can Cook Was a show i used to watch all the time
this why chinese chef the best
1:00笑死
@mrnigelng uncle Roger, can you guess Jamie Oliver's 2nd language? I'll give you a hint, 💩 and his motto is yeah haa!!
Hope uncle Roger and Martin Yan will collab a weejio one day lol😂
I used to use his recipes when I worked in a college kitchen. Those kids loved his tofu.
How hot is your studio? 😂😂 never saw you sweating so much. Loved the video though!
I have one of his chef's knives and a cookbook. Love Yan
I missed the show really.
Corn is amazing.
Loved Yan growing up!
Why are you being at eight dollars for Amazon prime. I only pay seven.
You been wanting to watch parasite for months.
0:42 He's literally Cantonese from Guangzhou, China. Can Nephew Nigel speak Cantonese, though?
Goddamn, Mongorians.
ExpressVPN does not work with Netflix lmao
If Yang can cook so can you! Yang inspired me to make Asian food at home 🫶🏻
ooh nice mous phone case. i have the same one
Is he still alive?
I watched this show religiously growing up. I thought Martin Yan was one of the coolest persons I've ever seen and he absolutely was a big reason why I got into cooking. So cool seeing Uncle Roger doing an episode on him.
You must start to degrade all non cooks not cooking with MSG by Mao Communist Socialist Credit Score. Must vote down according to communist rules! No Peking Duck!!! Racist!
i totally agreed bout the inflation bs.. price keep getting higher but salary stay the same.. f u minister!!
More Martin yan please
that good morning towel. fuiyoh!
Fuuiyoh
I remember him.. omg I'm so old lol
My local vegan Chinese restaurant makes a delicious vegan Peking duck with bao buns, so good. I don’t want to eat leaves.
He has the yummy face of Mark Wiens.
As a Taiwanese, I get satisfied easily just to hear Uncle Roger mention Taiwan in his weejio💕😳
Asian Emeril
finally can see uncle roger no put down leg from chair😅
Uncle Roger, why Chef Yan didn’t use your favorite condiment, chili jam. 🤣 I’m the Jaime Olive oil of comedians.
Poor Aunty Helen. They got her boobs out on display.
only abolishing the federal reserve can help keep down the cost of peking duck
Truly classic 😊
Genghis Khan would have eaten the whole pepper. Why Uncle Roger so puntain, not eat white part?
Martin Yan was awesome, I like Ken Hom too. I was an adolescent in the 80s but my dad introduced it to me and my love of cooking.
You know the dish is gonna be fire when it’s served on that plastic red plate
Before Yan Can Cook, there was Wok With Yan.
The first TV show I liked. I still like cooking to this day. Maybe he is part of the reason I have such an open-minded palette. Also, it seems like uncle roger upped his editing and writing  for this video. Hehe
Martin Yan is the best. The true OG of all cooking shows.
I was about to say that I remembered MSG was sorta banned or had a huge scare amongst western countries that time but glad you mentioned it and he is indeed smart
I enjoy his boopers😂😂I always laugh n wonder if he ever laughs at his own jokes not until I see bloopers 😅
There were 3 TV shows that you did NOT bother Grandma when she was watching them. General Hospital, Bob Ross, and Yan Can Cook. To this day I can remember one of his plays on words. He said "Whistle while you wok". I thought that was the greatest saying ever. Thanks for conjuring so many happy memories of my childhood with this episode.
pls review charles the french's pad thai
why is the (Funny Asian Man) trend so popular? uncle Yan, Jackie Chan, Uncle Roger .... etc...? there are all kinds of ethnicities with accents, Latins, Middle Eastern, European, African, Martian, Pacific Islander etc.... but only the Asian can turn his accent to comedy?
I love he's show on PBS when i was a kid ,guy Is GOAT. I ❤ cooking
No, secret ingredient in Chinese takeaway marinade is baking soda…. Look it up, try it n thank me later 😎
I love him 😍
My mom and I watched him all the time.
Aye leave Martin alone😂
hey   U  guy  wanna    have   everybody   like   YOU    more ????  !!!      Speak   ENGLISH   with   NO   Chingy  Accent   ,    BOY  !!!!!!!
how about chef Wan of Malaysia?
7:48: Every Asian household does have that towel, love to see it!
Martin Yan was teaching us how to cook with a wok properly like 20 years before we even knew that was going to be a need in our life.
His knife skills are 🔥🔥🔥
so OG the video quality so Gold
Uncle roger please review chef rush
👍👍👍
I had a huge crush on Uncle Martin Yan when I was a kid. 💖💖💖💖 So sexy!  xxx
Repping Japan must tank your social credits.
There is almost no traditional food in Mongolia. All the foods are from china and russia. Only food i know it is traditional is just cooked meat.
Gee I even remember this show in New Zealand,
Ah Uncle Yan, the 80s Uncle Rodger
This brings back A LOT of memories.
“Cost of rice so high…“  lmao I’m sitting here and laughing knowing full well that my country banning rice exports lead to the global price hike of rice.  Rice export ban made rice so cheap and affordable in the country that I have enough rice in my house to last me a year. Had it not been done, it would have been like the COVID situation all over again, rice hoarding by suppliers leading to more price hike and then rich countries buying most, if not all of it because of the greater purchasing power.
Yan can cut up a chicken too!  18 seconds.  Video:  https://youtu.be/V37Pc45P4HA?si=EjXBH7s3WH-UqWzS
Cancelled by China AND Taiwan at the same time... Achievement unlocked? :D
Yan is the man!
I met him at my culinary graduation
uncle roger got his accent fun Uncle Yan
I'm Mongolian and I approve
I loved watching Yan Can Cook when I was a kid.
"If Yan can cook, so can you!" I too remember this tv show.
The fact uncle roger watches one piece fuiyaaa🤌🏽
Nearly 600k views in 16 hours 🙌🏻
Uncle Roger, you gotta do some digging on STEPHEN YAN from Vancouver. He introduced wok hei to us whiteys in BC in the late '70s. And Martin Yan once worked for him.   Best mashup would be Stephen Yan & Uncle Roger cooking together in matching "wok" aprons.
Taiwan is free china lol.
I've seen this before, now I feel to old.
@3:49 you hope jamie watching?
I Miss this i wasnt born in the 80s but I definitely remember growing up and watching this
Omfg YAN CAN COOK!!! Lol childhood fav, THE GOAT!  If Yan can cook, SO CAN YOU !!!!
WAIT MSG IS ALSO KNOWN AS E621 SALT for those who know, you know.
as a mongolian i respect this
I used to love this show as a child. PBS has great cooking shows.
https://youtube.com/@ChefMartinYan?si=uDPTGZrytQV5YUSx  he has youtube channel, still live few times
Mr. Yan is the man. American Icon from the 80s to now.
i love uncle yans 'massage the chicken' video
9:31.   The Peking Duck Taco is born.
My mom loved watching his show.
I grew up watching “the Galloping Gourmet”, “The French Chef”, “The Frugal Gourmet”, “Yan Can Cook”, and Simply Ming. This brings back good memories.
Uncle Martin is Uncle Roger actual Uncle, same hair
I miss the 80s
Uncle Yan is also my hero!! In Singapore we have him dubbed in mandarin and in that language the tag line is "全部放進去！"  Ahh.. just nostalgic simpler times.. 🥲
Stephen Yan of Wok With Yan (Canadian Chinese cooking show - also an Uncle IMO unfortunately no relation to Martin Yan AFAIK) had a "secret" - Tapioca starch.  Apparently when used in a marinade it's even better than cornstarch because it's a bit of a tenderizer and it works, legit.
For me it was Fu Pei Mei that enticed me to learn cooking as a kid, I loved watching her every sunday morning.
My friend's sibling went to high school with Martin Yan's kids... Pretty wild w
Oh, I used to LOVE to watch this show.   I recently went back and did a bunch of his recipes.   They were all pretty damned good.   Of course I added a lot of MSG.   FOR FLA-VOR.
A good Peiking Duck more around 30 to 50 USD in China nowadays, event at some pro resturant.
the other chef yan i watched was wok with yan
I always looked forward to the weekend after all of the Saturday cartoons were done showing. Always about 12 sometimes the episodes were longer and the food looked so good. I think it’s his animated face.
I had peking duck once, the toilet was my best friend for awhile after, grease beat me lol
Game recognizes game. Love this level of respect toward Uncle Yan.  Such groundbreaking stuff. Awesome.
Please make video of uncle roger throw
This was a great video. Going to try a few of these dishes myself. They still haven't fixed your AC yet?
As someone who live in Hong Kong. I would say Uncle Roger’s estimate is a bit high, even if we only account for the more authentic ones, I’d say the price range is closer to 110 to 200 USD
Martin Yan was so popular in the early 80s because his English was so funny it made the studio audience laugh. They enjoyed his shows, but not really his cooking.
Damn this was a nice trip down memo lane. Good old days. Yan and Ming Tsai.
“He was the first person to bring flavor to America”  Black people/Natives/Hispanics:😒😒😒
Gotta be real, I always preferred Wok With Yan over Yan Can Cook
(As a Taiwanese) “Taiwan is not even a country~” Me thinking: fuck it🤣 (of course I know he was joking)
Social credit score just went up... 🤣 Uncle Rodger the legend who doesn't give a crap! Love it!
All Asians know Mr Yan....
Martin Yan's chopping comes with a rhythm if you watched more of his cook-shows..
You don’t dawg
I grew up watching Martin Yan and this brings back so many good memories. I'm so happy you made a video with his cooking.
We want Uncle Roger favorite Kpop songs review HAIYAAAAAAAA!!!
Your AC is broken or something Uncle ?
又好吃，又好看。色香美味甄能煮
I'm 37 years old and this guy I think was what got me interested in flavor. I give him so much respect for bringing Asian cooking to the US and my brain!
Brings back so many memories. Loved watching his show. Food network used to be that way when it first started, now it's just full of competition shows unfortunately
My favorite childhood TV show 🥰
Woah, nice! Made with Lau shoutout. That's one of my favorite old men who can cook.
Martin Yan is an imposter. The original yan had a cooking show in canada in the 80's called Wok With Yan. It was on in the daytime sometime after Price is Right. He was very funny and every episode he wore an apron with a new funny caption or pun, like "Wok The Heck?".
the real og
First off eff Jamie Oliver and his bs child.. who names a child “buddy” and
My god Uncle Yan is so wholesome. I feel like I missed out as a child.
Omg I used to love this show ❤
I just realized there are two Yan cooking shows from the 80's! In Canada we had one called Wok with Yan who wore aprons every episode with wok puns on them, and then Yan can Cook as shown here.
He was from where I was born, Guangzhou, the birthplace of Cantonese cuisine, the most famous of the Eight Major Chinese Regional Cuisines.
Back when TV have real chef, not Jamie Oliver.
Bob Ross of cooking
Yan and Justin Wilson... my two faves from my childhood
He has wok! Haiyaaa of course uncle Yan has wok, his TV show title is WOK with Yan😂
Taiwan is a great Country! 🇹🇼❤️
China is not a country
Yan Can was the Man!!  Inwas born in 1973 and other than watching the Edmonton Oilers hockey once a week, I had to see Martin Yan. I had to teach my mom haw to tape it on VHS as ours didn't have that option.  There wierdest thing is the only Chinese food I liked was sweet and sour chicken balls but I loved his cooking and so I gory mom to teache how to cook and now she says I have better than her (she lies)  a 12 year old baby sports jock was turned into a good cook by Yan Can
8:00 Peking Man was a well loved band in the 80's here in New Zealand! Their biggest hit was "Room That Echoes" which reached number one on the NZ music charts in 1985!  SURELY, this is the Peking Man that Martin was referring to :P :P :P
Uncle Roger, please review Uncle Lau; his fried rice recipe is awesome!
nguuuuuu
As a Taiwanese person speaking on behalf of all Taiwanese people, we can take a stupid joke. China? So sensitive.
Some people my age talk about remembering watching Julia Child on PBS as a kid. For me, some of my earliest TV memories was watching Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan (Yes I know Stephen and Martin are not related, but I remember both of those shows). I truly think Uncle Yan is part of why I liked asian food as a white child in California, and why I love eating foods from other cultures.
I watched Yan Can Cook with my dad when I was growing up in the '80s. I absolutely loved his show. We need more shows like his back on the air... and less Jamie Oliver and Rachel Ray.
wait isnt that fraud to change ur location and buy the stuff there???
I still remember when he said in China we use every part of the chicken, except the cluck.
Back in 2010, I had the chance to see Martin in person as there was a food festival in my city that year, and Martin had been a guest at an event. We got to see Martin cook his version of some classic Vietnamese dishes and my grandpa even managed to get his signature. I was very small at the time so I didn't really understand the "gravity of the situation" however.
I watched him when I was small kid and always found him fascinating. Such a showman.
Taiwan is a real country brother 😡🇮🇳
❤🇹🇼❤
Martin Yan is the Bob Ross of cooking
My favorite Chinese restaurant serves the Mandarin pancakes with some dishes. I never knew what it is and always called them tortillas.
STUPID A**…🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻  The Country of Taiwan is ACTUALY THE REAL China.
I watched him for years.  I can never see or hear the word bok choy without hearing him say, "Shanghai baby bok choy" in my head.  Yan is a true legend.
I watched Yan Can Cook so often with my grandparents. Started me on my flavor journey as a young person. I always wanted to try these things but it wasn't until the mid to late 90s that we had availability near us that didn't come from a grocery store can. 😢 This throwback makes me feel so good.
Dude I loved Martin Yan!!! I watched his show obsessively while growing up.
I remember watching Martin yen on PBS as a kid he was just always positive and every dish he made we amazing and I remember him saying " if Yan can cook, so can you!" Never gets old
Chef Yan is coming to Perth, Western Australia next month,  and hopefully part of a street food event!
🤣🤣🤣
I remember watching martin when I was 5. True OG
the energy from Mr.Yan is so fresh, not only in his cooking skill, but also in his every words. This man is truly a legend
Can I sent you a window AC unit? I feel so bad for you. :(
When I was growing up, we watched 2 cooking shows by 2 Chinese OG chefs - Martin Yan and Steven Yan (Based in Canada). Both were exceptional chefs, and Steven Yan was hilarious.
I laughed because of your comments. I cried because of the time gone by. very good information comedy. Maybe you could do another Martin Yan review.
yan can cook... yep
Netflix?my big sister pay for me ,in exchange i take care of her daughter 😘
I remember Martin Yan too! I feel so old now.  I've also learnt to cook Peking Duck. I do it over 2 days. It's not hard to cook, but it's a real pain to do the preparation.
uncle roger did you know “Wok with Yan” with Stephen Yan?  he was before Martin Yan they werent related…
i remember watching him early 90s.. i was 9
I got amazing Mongolian beef in the ‘90s in Japan.
I grew up with Yan on PBS ❤
I think he's your long lost dad 😲
Omg.  So many good memories watching him.  He got me into cooking.   Love how he relaxed the chicken.
Oh my god,I had totally forgotten about this guy! There are so many awesome cooking shows from that era that my ADHD brain let go of throughout the years.   I've gotta see more of his stuff again. Fantastic cook. Thanks for the Nostalgia, uncle Roger!
I used to watch this dude when I was a kid in the 80s and 90s. He inspired my love of Chinese food, which blossomed into a love of all Asian cuisines. I cook often, and am now teaching my seven year old son how to stir fry in my carbon steel wok on my little 14,000 btu wok burner. Martin Yan is a true treasure.
Uncle Yan like the Bob Ross of cooking
And "Wok with Yan"!  I loved watching him as a kid ❤
uncle roger, i have the exact same towel as yours
Omg I loved that show!!
Here’s the OG - apparently Martin worked for this Canadian superstar, demonstrating his products. Stephen Yan’s WOK WITH YAN.  https://youtu.be/PTjwTieqhJY?si=AhR6AfiVY2cNVjfX
Yes please Collab with Uncle Yan!!!!
He is a legend, I remember watching his cooking shows way back in the day with my mom who was a big fan.  Brings back good memories.
Yan Can Cook -- love the 80s !!!
I use to watch him back in the 80s. Him and the old tobasco guy. Can you please do a love mimi weejo
I miss Martin Yan. I used to watch his show. I love Uncle Roger so hilarious 😅😅😅
I miss Martin Yan. I used to watch his show. I love Uncle Roger so hilarious 😅😅😅
As long as i can remember Yan Can Cook has been playing on channel 11 WTTW in Chicago and has always been the best inspiration of cooking for a lot of us. i still use his method for crushing garlic to this day : D
Hi Uncle roger big fan but Wok with Yan is the first
When I was a kid in the 80's this was one of my favorite TV shows. I credit Martin Yan with my lifelong interest in Asian food and my cooking.
My man Martin Yan!!!!  He can cut up a chicken like nobody's business.  Back when the only cooking shows were on PBS and Julia Child was still the standard.  Martin Yan was an oasis in a desert of boring television.
Uncle Roger you are my favourite ❤ please make a video on review of Chef Ranveer Brar's Egg Fried rice 🍚 ... it's my request please ❤❤
I loved watching Yan, PBS in Colorado.
Peking duck is absolutely delicious. Used to have it all the time in thailand. The smell is still fresh in my nose 🤤
This was my fav childhood show.  Things seem simplier back in the days.
4:18 Yeah I like good cleavage sounds too
The If you don't use the bell pepper all vegetables are grow wild on the plains of Mongolia. I was watching a show and when the did the gathering. I thought that is everything that goes into Mongolian beef. The only problem is they don't have cows.
America still thinks we Chinese speak like that.... LOL
I miss his tv shows. I used to watch him all the time with my grandmother
he's one of the reason i join culinary as a job, not a single regret and big thanks to the OG legend himself.
just get ac
Fuiyoh, I just noticed Uncle Roger's face towel same as mine in Indonesia. I have some of them
Whoa!!!!!  Finally a video of guru sifu Yan!!  I recalled in the 80s seeing Yan cooking show!!  Let's do it uncle Roger!! Have a show together with Sifu Yan!!!  Would be amazing!!!!
Review Drunken Migos
UNCLE YAN OG
Uncle Roger, your lack of air conditioning makes me sad. I don't know how you survive filming. T_T
I’m mongolian and we never make Mongolian beef. But I can approve this is the best way to eat a beef.
Stare fry👀
Me: Who’s Yan? Everyone else: *Asian Slaps me*
Earning those social credits the hard way. 😁
Martin Yan is an absolute treasure.
Martin Yan is literally my home-cooking teacher during my childhood days.
Martin Yan is the man!! I’m so glad KQED started uploading his episodes during the pandemic.   I’m a drum-line instructor. I made the cover picture of my music binder a picture of Martin Yan.
where u get ur towel uncle? hahaha.. very legendary towel
👊🏿👑
I'm from Mongolia and I never heard of Mongolian beef hahaha.
Love Yan Can Cook!  I watched this in the 80s, too.  Yes, it was a simpler time.
I used to watch this as a kid... Thank you very much for this video... Never a bad memory.
Clearly 90's
If we're doing classics, can we please do wok with yan?
My family always watched Yan Can Cook every week
I watched this show religiously growing up ❤
I used to watch Yan Can Cook every weekend when I was younger! Loved it!
I never had that dish even im mongolian
"Uncle Roger would eat that!" that's what he said Auntie Ester.
Martin Yan also a Tutor for Chef Wan
I loved watching Yan Can Cook when I was a kid.
Wok with Yan....I remember watching this guy for years.
The sound of chopping makes me feel so good!!!😌😌😌
that was the most unhinged ad transition ever 😅
Growing up in San Francisco in the 80s we used to watch this all the time on PBS. He was royalty in our household.
Ever heard of a show called "Wok with Yan"?
YAN RULES! White boy from New England USA  Edit:  TAIWAN #1
Uncle Roger thank you for sharing this wonderful peron with us. I was very young when he was on TV so I do not remember him-the TV cooks I remember are Julia Child and the galloping gourmet. I am gping to make a point of searching for his videos.
2:15 : that how he doing tax frauds
Now do Pasquale's Kitchen Express!!!!
Gagii ka talaga 😂😂😂
Do u have a wood anime case?! Me too
My dad met Martin Yan when Martin was flying out of SFO to Hong Kong on one of his many trips.  Martin gave my dad an autographed copy of one of his cook books and my dad used the hellout of that book.  Our favorite dish was mango beef, my dad made it so many times he could do it from memory.  Even years after my dad had passed, we keep that cookbook in the same place my dad kept it because of how much it meant to our dad and because it it has been an oddly important part of our kitchen for the last 30 years.
Yan can Cook is not the only show, I also watch Wok with Yan, starring Stephen Yan. They're not related though.
This video don't have an official subtitle because deaf people need to learn how to take care of themselves
Man, that MSG giving you the BP sweats
No peppers! Thin sliced onion only, with green onion for garnish!
Mans getting cancelled by BOTH Chinas 😂
If Yan can cook , so can you!!!! I'm gonna call him grandpa Yan
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was my childhood TV show back then!  Oh yes, he's a truly professional chef for as long as he's started!  This is the true authentic meal deal!
I loved Yan Can Cook when I was a kid
I LOVED Yan Can Cook!  And his show was absolutely groundbreaking-- basically the Julia Child of Chinese cooking, because he showed the average (North) American home cook that Chinese cuisine could be both approachable and healthy.  (Not that it wasn't, but he was working against some pretty entrenched stereotypes.)  My mother bought her first wok because of him.
Love this weejio!  I grew up watching Yan Can Cook!
Nobody says Peanut Oil like Yan!
thank you so much for this you done so before i couLd even ask.... xD
Anyone else remember him being a guest judge on an episode of one of Gordon Ramsey’s shows? He had the same awesome enthusiasm. Used to watch Chef Yan on channel 11 in Chicagoland.
Met Martin Yan in San Francisco's Chinatown when I was 8. Have all of his books, my dad loved his show, too.
Gotta have the noodle. Only thing missing from most Mongolian Beef dishes
Did we just get a Cooking with Lau reference here? Love that channel. I also love Yan Can Cook. That was my childhood.
while in malaysia..  1.chicken 2.duck 3.pork   i like those 2 and 3.. its like rare one.. chicken is most easy to find.. any restaurants.. for those other two is only chinese restaurants..
I used to watch "Wok With Yan" back in the day.
If yan can cook  sorry chef I can't cook 😂
Can we get more of this man?
3:58  Woah, didn't you notice that was Chinese Morse code? He said, "Niece and Nephew be sure to Subscribe to Uncle Roger in 37 years or the great dragon will singe your Jap's eye with wok fire; FUIYO!!!"  Didn't you hear it? That's actually my text message notification tone...
Hi Uncle Roger, why don't you try to review some k-pop idols making some dishes? I feel like it would be a good weejio! :3
Hoisin sauce is one the only things I can just put some on my finger or a spoon and eat it all by itself, it's addictive.
Uncle Roger is in love
YESSSS
I do enjoy some "MongoRean Beep."
It’s great to see the clip from Made With Lau. That channel is one of the easiest to follow and most helpful when it comes to Chinese (mostly Cantonese) cooking.
I always loved watching Yan Can Cook as a kid.  Also really loved Louisiana Cooking with Justin Wilson, the cajun cook.
I remember watching Martin yans Chinatown all the time on the food network
No one :   Uncle Rogers in the BTS 🐓↗️🐓↙️🐓↗️🐓↙️🐓↗️🐓↘️🐓↗️🐓↙️🐓
Yan Can Cook was one of the handful of cooking shows I watched as a kid with my dad, along with Justin Wilson and Jacques Pepin and others, and seeing Martin Yan just now just made me feel so nostalgic.
Uncle Yan was one of my favorite shows when I was young.
My mom learned how to cook from him and Julia Childs.
My mom and I loved watching Yan Can Cook. Since he catered for an American audience, it made it easier for us to find alternatives to ingredients. It was difficult to get traditional Korean and Chinese ingredients in the 80s, in the US.
Isn't it just Dad?
Uncle roger use good morning towel, that is a legendary towel in Malaysia. But still cant afford aircond, haiyaaa
I learnt cooking from Martin Yan.. I use cleaver exclusively in my kitchen
I remember watching this show in the 1980's. This is one reason why TV was good back then. Thanks for bringing this show back Uncle Roger.
It's rare to see Uncle Roger simp over another uncle but this was nice to see.  He got so turned on that he started glistening 🤣
Which one's Uncle Roger
No. Seriously. How do we get Martin Yan to film with you? This has to happen.
Yes! Martin Yan/Uncle Roger collaboration. Watched Yan all the time when i was young!! GenX had the best TV!!
Fictional recipe... soy sauce still correct.
Loved this show in the 80s.  My mom got me a ticket to a class of him teaching cooking techniques/recipes at a local store.  I learned so much that I still use 25 years later.  I screamed when I saw this new Uncle Roger, yelled “Dam straight!” at the OG Uncle title, made my son watch with me (hubby needed no convincing) and pointed out five of son’s favorite recipes come from the pamphlet I got from the master class (I have the Yan Can Cookbook as well).
Wages stay the same. Generally, salaried employees are making a ton more money than hourly employees.
Yan can cook is one of my favorites. old school, no gimmicks or trends, just quality entertaining cooking.
how is this guy not canceled yet 💀 💀
I love Yan Can Cook!!! So nostalgic!
I gotta try me one of them duck fajitas
There were no "sorry children" moment in this weedjo?😮😢
Uncle Roger social score not 0. I suppose is -100. Hahaha
Shout out to @MadeWithLau here!
Do you need an air conditioner, Uncle Rodger?
Uncle Yan is the uncle you secretly want
I thought Martin Yan was from Canada. I think he filmed in Calgary.
love this video Uncle Roger lol. looks delicious too
...And baking soda
Don't criticise Martin Yan's cooking.  I will fight you.  Such a nice man. I used to watch his cooking show on Canadian TV.   For the longest time, I thought his name was Yan Can.  LOL
Still needs AC
I watched him as a kid in the 80s on PBS.  Every Saturday morning.  I even taped his shows on my VCR so I could rewatch them.  He is the single reason I love Asian food and culture so much as an adult.  Almost 50 years old now.
chef martin yan is a hero
I liked watching Uncle Yan's cooking show in the 2000s when I was a child. One thing I am proud of him is that he is from my hometown.
cut here, cut here, cut here...
Hoisen sauce? I've always used Oyster Sauce.
the only legendary checf i like to watch when i'm childhood
I got Martin Yan's signature when I was in high school, maybe around 1990? He demoed cooking with a wok at a DIY expo at my county fairgrounds. I think he made broccoli beef, I was one of the volunteers how got to try his meal.  He called me a "handsome young man" in his signature, so clearly that moment launched me to greatness.
You should do a review on Jamie Oliver's son
Grew up watching him in Chicago ❤
“By pancake I mean penis”
Uncle Yan is also many Vietnamese childhood cook. In Viet Nam around that time, English is not common but everyone know 3 words by heart, "Yan Can Cook". He is a legend!!!
Winnie the Pooh subscribed after Uncle Rodgers Taiwan comment.
I LOVED watching this dude with my mom back in the day! My first celebrity chef. And holy cats, i remember watching this episode as a kid!  Gotta send this link to her.
Morning and was one of my favorite shows back in the 80s
I remember his show.  He was so much fun to watch.  The 80's was a great decade.
Day 2 of asking uncle roger to say 9 + 10 equals 21
Martin Yan is the goat.  I used to watch him with my mom as a child and we would just be in awe of his knife skills.
Marty Yan is the legendary OG! Uncle Roger can learn a lot from Sifu Yan
Uncle Roger using the legend "Good Morning" towel!
I wonder if Uncle roger will do a collab with Chef Brian Tsao who will probably be reacting to this and .. dropped a vid the same day as guga... hmm...  Man, that was a memory from long loooong ago locked inside my mind that was freed.  I miss the 80s an being a kid then, Yan can cook so can you,
😂😂😂😂😂
if uncle roger feel happy, you can feel happy <3 !
to malaysian... using tuala good morning🤣🤣🤣
Do Fu pai mei content please
Yan can STILL cook, I saw a new episode on PBS recently.
I had an encounter with Uncle Martin decades ago.  In San Franciso after the Chinese New Year parade, in a hotel men's room, there I was at a urinal, when Uncle Martin comes in and stands next to me.  I wanted to say hello, but man code dictates that you cannot utter  a sound when you are at the urinal.  So that was my brush with greatness.
7:35 is that uncle daft?
I dont care how, just make a video happen with master chef Yan! Please. We need this!
Canadians love Yan can Cook
Koshihikari rice is nice... but have you had three ladies jasmine rice? Total game changer
I used to watch his shows to uncle Roger 💯 %
I love the fact that Uncle Roger and I use the same Good Morning towel.
He mentioned hong kong
yakuza like a dragon : peking duck
I only got flash backs now.  This was the only cooking show me and my friends liked when we were kids.  Only guy that made cooking accessible.  Good memories
I just subscribed to his youtube channel ( @ChefMartinYan )  Thank you for introducing us to this wholesome person. I will be watching all his videos and the show.  At least all the episodes I can find.
I used to love watching his show on Saturday mornings when I was a teenager. One of the best chefs on TV!
Yah (and all the PBS chefs) were my babysitters growing up
Its usually baking soda that makes the meat tender cornstarch thickens the sauce
I used to watch Martin Yan on PBS all the time back in the day! He was the best! Also the Frugal Gourmet and Julia Child, too.
I remember watching Yan Can Cook all the time when I was younger.  He was one of my favorite TV chefs to watch.
I’m Taiwanese and I’d have to say Taiwan 🇹🇼 definitely a country. Don’t give a damn on social credit. We don’t have that shit in Taiwan 😂
Martin Yan ****!
Hope uncle roger will roast jamie oliver,s son
Master Yan!
Martin Yang he js my fav hegegege
Uncle Roger with the Good Morning towel screams SE Asian and Chinese vibes in it. Hahaha.
Does anyone remember Stephen Yan? He hosted an 80's cooking show on CBS titled, Wok with Yan. He had a different pun written on his apron for each episode, such as Wok Don't Run, and Wokkey Night in Canada. When the cook was complete, he would invite an audience member to eat with him, and always opened a fortune cookie before the meal. His show and Yan Can Cook are similar. and though not related, Martin Yan, had once worked for Stephen Yan, as a demonstrator for Stephen's products.
Love this guy! Also so funny!
EVERYBODY'S WOKING!
Uncle roger's not looking for subscriber for sure😂 he keep making himself get cancel
He had three woks. He’s a wok f*** boy.
Still watch him on YouTube
There was another similar show around the 80s  called Wok with Yan.  He name is Stephen Yan.  I remember thinking is there anything he can’t cook in that wok.
Your hairstyle and voice matches with Martin Yan's, is he the ultimate Asian uncle??
I used to love watching Yan can cook, because if Yan can cook, so can you!.
Omg I watched this guy in the 90’s growing up good times better tv no one using hot rice for fried rice❤
Using the play icon in the top right in the style of playing a VHS (or Beta) on a VCR at home, instead of the usual YouTube style play icon in the middle, is subtle and awesome.
My mother loved (and still loves) Martin Yan! She watched his show all of the time and his catchphrase of "If Yan can cook, so can you." is embedded in my childhood memories. Quite a few of the dishes she's cooked and continues to cook were inspired by his simple recipes (like dredging meat in oyster sauce instead of beaten egg before coating with breadcrumbs).
Uncle Roger can you please review the old tv show "Wok with Yan" it was one of my favorite shows as a kid
Nice to see the good morning towel. Definitely asian thing
I remember this show! I watched it with my grandmother. He is the reason I like cooking!
Yan and other TV chefs on the public broadcast system in the late 90s were what inspired me to go to culinary school.
Taiwan comment so funny, I had to put my leg down from chair.
Saying Peking duck is a lot more delicious implies that someone tried to sample the other dried Peking meat.
Now do Wok With Yan!
Wok With Yan/Yan Can Cook was THE SHIZNIT when I was young.
irmemner him on tv in canada where he did a show in calgary before moving to the USA, and he also apprenticed for another chinese canadian name stephen yan who also had a great show called wok with yan
Yan Can Cook was the first TV Chef I remember, what an icon.
Thank You!! this is my childhood watching with my mom!! and then trying the recipies!!!
Yan Can Cook! I lived in San Francisco in the late 90s and watched this show nearly every weekend.
Hot pan, cold oil, food won't stick. Yan wisdom.
Yan’s cookbook was the first and only cookbook I ever purchased, best cookbook ever!!
Your room still no aircon 😅
Uncle  Rogerbsounded like a crow caring during the blooper of him throwing a towel. 😂😂😂😂😂
I've watched 8 ads on this blog so you can earn money as you mentioned you dont have one!
Wait, was this whole video just a way to try and meet Yan?  Wish I thought of that.
The blooper compilation of uncle roger screams souned like a goose
I remember this show on PBS, I love this man and I learned so much from him
WOW! I remember this!! I still remember that catch phrase "If Yan can cook, so can you!" ... and I even remember the dish he was making... it was shrimp with cashews... and I even remember the joke he made!!! He said, "if you don't have any cashews, then the dish is just shrimp without cashews" ... nostalgia overdose!
Yan was my favorite cook as a child❤ He was the best!❤
I loved MartinYan!!!!
I don't know if it's beneficial information or not, but I can confirm that I have the red plastic plate that Martin Yan used. Lots of 'em.
Pls Uncle, i beg you to review a cooking video by KingCobraJFS. I promise he's the love child of Kay and Jack
I loved watching Martin Yam’s show very much
Peking duck sucks , nothing but skin , fat and bone . Long Island duck is far superior in any preparation.
What's  the Philippine equivalent of cellophane noodle? Bihon or Sotanghon?
I love this video. Roger is calm, happy, just agreeable with everything. I want more of Martin Yan on here!
Yan Can Cook was one of my favorite shows as a kid. Fucking 10/10.
WhooHoo! Uncle Yan! I used to watch him all the time. He had a catch phrase that I can't quit remember. Does he like to smash it instead of pounding it? I bet I know by the end of the video. Thank you Uncle Roger for the memories.
oh my goooosssh! Martin Yan! Yan Can Cook brings back nostagia!
Watching this on 1.1x hits different
Wok with Yan is very popular in the Philippines back on the late 80s to the 90s rather than Yan can cook!
If Yan can cook so can you.. except if you're Jamie Oliver
Grew up with this uncle. No wonder I'm a better cook now.
You should have reviewed Stephen Yan! The original Wok with Yan.
That's right... hoisin sauce and oyster sauce have secret msg
So, corn starch a plants only in USA the corn. ....LOL don't take this too serious I am just having a little fun
Martin was one of the first cooking shows I watched
Martin Yan and Stephen Yan (no relation) were my introduction to authentic Chinese cooking when I was young. I still hold both of them to a high regard today.
I met him last year (2022) for a cooking demo. hes still as sharp and witty as ever.
My parents loved that show 😄
I'm mongolian and first time i heard  about the mongolian beef i was like what the hail is this????
Stir fry and stare fry got me 😂
The social credit score raise 😂
I have been making the stare fry/stir fry joke since I saw this on TV 30 years ago. Immortal talent
Thank you so much for talking about him! I grew up with him on PBS.
Martin Yan is the reason I’m a chef. I grew up watching him and still love him
If there is one thing this guy is always gonna do right it’s going to be to roast the shit out of Jamie Oliver 😂😂
First time I Saw Aunty Helen😂😂😂
This was one of my favorite shows to watch when I was a kid growing up in Canada, such a cheerful and fun guy.
https://youtu.be/PTjwTieqhJY?si=OT56DolN8Xm32sK1 Uncle Roger the first chinese to bring chinese food to america is this guy
Uncle Roger, You need to get Uncle Martin Yan on this channel as a Collab!!! Please!!! So we can see that not only Yan can Cook but also Uncle Roger Can cook as well!!!   That would be beyond epic!!!
uncle roger got good morning towel merch now lol
I loved him growing up. He made me want to learn to cook. Have never looked back
i used to watch it in the afternoons while doing my homework
We have to have "Wok with Yan" also
Mongolian Beef at P.F. Chang's...or as I like to call it, overpriced sit-down Pei Wei.  (seriously, it's the same food)
Yan was the man. Also, best Space Ghost Coast to Coast guest ever. At least top 3.
Can you please react to his new videos? He still makes the old style cooking videos and deserves recognition
Can someone set up a go fund me for uncle roger so he can purchase an air conditioner? He’s turning me on looking like he just got done having sex with all that sweat on his body.
300 HK only, not so bad...
Not a fan of Martin Yan's cooking. Had one of his restaurants on campus when I was in college. It was the blandest, caucasian version of chinese food.
Taiwan >Communist China
I grew up with Julia Child, Jeac Pepan, Jeff Smith, and Uncle Yan.  Yan-San was by far the rock star of the OG Uncles back in the day.  I'd love to see more Uncle Roger videos on the other Auntie and Uncles as well. Actually, Jeac is still making videos.
I cooked for Martin Yan back when I was working at iChina last year.
Yan can cook! was how I learned to cook, watching at 5 years old with my Grandma.
Cool, I used to watch Yan all the time as a kid. Learned how to make all sorts of Chinese dishes thanks to Yan Can Cook. The only downside was that my racist father couldn't stop making fun of his accent if his life depended on it. -__-"
1:18 killed me my cheeks hurt from how quickly i whipped a laugh out.
Chili oil is awesome. It's definitely not optional.
He had a restaurant around where I live for a while and the food was seriously bad.  They went out of business within about a year. Hopefully he just licensed his name cuz the food was not good.
Uncle don't forgot OG Stephen yen. I believe he had a show even before martin, WOK with Yen.  Both are Two Great Legendary cooks. I loved watching both as a kid.
This community really appreciates the value of good ol' e621
And its DONE
FYI: Japanese Netflix has all the seasons of all the animes…..in Japanese. No English dubs. Not even English subs. 100% Japanese only.
Ahaha Nice nice I like it
9:25 I HIGHLY encourage everyone to try beijing roast duck wrapped in buns like  that. It's so juicy and the skin has a such a nice crispy texture. The remaining parts of the duck are also used to make this absolutely delicious soup too. My family would eat this for thanksgiving and special events over turkey because of how good it is
We love your video ❤ keep it up and when are you coming to las vegas for concert we love to go and see you live...
Wok with Yan was more OG than Martin.
Oh man, this brings back really old time memories, that's all I watched from cooking channel
properly made beijing kaoya is so good, went to a restaurant famous for it with my wife, so good.
Omg Pei King duck sandwich has gotta be the original taco!
Noticed a lot of hand gestures of uncle yan. You can't cook like uncle yan unless you learn kung fu.
Don’t stare fry … It’ll burn.  Got it 😂❤
Yan Can Cook was the first cooking show I ever watched and I made sure to catch every episode. I loved that show.
Finally. The current Uncle reviews OG Uncle that I was waiting on for years to happen has happened. Uncle Yan is still an icon.
My dad went on a work trip to Beijing 2 times. One of those times he went with a colleague to a restaurant and ordered Peking duck. But being just under 6’2 and Dutch. And his colleague about the same. They ordered 2 hole ducks and the people of the restaurant were stunt to see them both ate an entire duck on there own
reviewing someone fuck up a dish was feeling a bit stale but this video was great, I've never heard of Yan and I really want to see more he seems amazing
Heck yeah!  Miss me some Yan Can Cook!
Mongolian Beef with steamed buns is my go to at a restaurant.
His cutting did have a rhythmic cadence to it.
Uncle Roger, for once finally spared us from the "sorry children," jokes FUI-YO
when I read Mongolian Beef, I expected some nice, thicc 8+ inch and initially very hard Steak, that needs lots of rough pounding in order to release it's delicious meaty juices....
I'll just have to come clean here... Yan looks exactly like my Japanese uncle! 😮😮
Yan Can Cook was legend in the UK. Drunken Chicken… amazing
quote of the year "inflation is bullshit" ~ Uncle Roger.
I'm 42 and we didn't have cable. Yan Can Cook was my favorite part of being home sick ❤️
BEFORE Yan Can Cook was Wok With Yan and I loved this show so much. Uncle Yan is the BEST.
Julia, Martin, Graham, and Jacques. The OGs of the OGs. Public TV was the Food Network before Cable was invented.
Please do more Yan weedios!!!
God that duck looks fantastic. I hope to try Peking Duck myself sometime soon. 😋
Uncle Yan was the first person who introduced me to cooking “Chinese” food at home. He really is the best!
People who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like this comment!
Uncle Roger never fails to entertain
Taiwan  real country...niggro
Lol what happened to use chopsticks for stirring
1:14 3:20 one of the funniest gags ever!! 😂
Excuse me while I spend the next year or so taking notes.
He's been visiting Malaysia. Check with him and plan a time to catch each other there!
This was one of my favorite shows.  I loved watching this.  Unfortunately, I was not able to re-create a lot of the dishes due to my lack of skills.  This was a great blast from the past.
I need to binge watch this series. 😁
Loved watching Yan as a kid to my teens . Learned a lot from him and many others on PBS Television , thank u for doing this vid .
The ending of the bloopers was beginning to sound like Japanese porn.
Bruh, you should review the Canadian Yan, he did a show called "Wok with Yan"
I remember watching his shows after coming back home from school, before the cartoons come on.
I grew up watching shows like Yan Can Cook on PBS. Awesome to see you watch him cook!
Speaking of 80s cooking?! "Wok with Yan" Is my timepast incomes of cooking..
Cleaver chopping sounded like morse code.
Waiting for offended taiwanese.
There were two Yans who taught me to cook on their shows, “Yan can Cook” and “Wok with Yan” . I know how to debone a chicken because of Martin Yan. Wok puns come from Stephen Yan.
Oh man, this brings back memories. Also, I always found Peking Duck to be too dry.
Why that WOK have a flat bottom? IMPOSTER!!!!!!!!! WOK?! FLAT BOTTOM?!!!! NOT REAL!
no kidding Martin Yan started my love of cooking. not only was he awesome but he was the only chef of TV that looked like me
YAN CAN COOK!!!!! I watched that all the time growing up. Can we get a collaboration video? The man can debone a chicken in LESS THAN 20 SECONDS!!!!!!
Taiwan "doesn't exist" so Mongolian Beef is Chinese !!!! FACTS!
I really love peking duck soup😊❤
Corn Starch? Secret ingedient? For tender beef? NO! Velveting! Marinating in baking soda for half hour or so first! That tender beef! Velveting with soda tender.. Cornstarch crispy!
Uncle Roger were you actually alive in 1982? I feel like you weren't even around when Yan showed everyone he CAN COOK
Yan can cook love that show
Roger finally hittin' that YAN CAN COOK!!!! HELL YEAH!
We had the Yan Can Cook Book in my house growing up in the 80s and since the only channel allowed on TV was PBS his was also the cooking show I knew as a kid. Without it we would never have had an idea of chinese-influenced home cooking. With it my mother and I learned to stir fry together. I haven't seen an ep in maybe 25 years but man it holds up. He really had it. I dusted the cook book off maybe a decade ago and still found it pretty useful. Thanks Uncle Roger for turning back the clock on this one!
holy shit the Taiwan joke was fire. brilliant
What’s the show? This is my new fave!! I just wanna cook with him lol
Martin Yan was surgical with his knife. He made it look WAY too easy.
It's funny that I asked Uncle Roger to review Yan Can Cook and two weeks later here's the video I requested. If you took my suggestion, sweet!
As a Mongolian ... those Chinese dish called Mongolian beef or chicken  dishes are nonsense ... we Mongolians never put lot of seasonings like those vinegar  and spicy chilies peppers at all, just salt and onion and simmer the meat and that's all
Is he still alive?
Shoutout to Uncle Roger doing sociopolitical sepoku during an ad-break😂
Somewhere here in the house I still have the recipe book that came with my first rice cooker - on the front cover it says *If Yan can cook, You can too*. I watched this show, the Cajun cook - older man, first name Justin - and 2 painting shows... Bob Ross and (no kidding it's what they called him) The Krazy Kraut ... those were the days that PBS was fun.
If Jamie has a 2 year old he/she will make better egg fried rice or carbonara than Jamie 😂
Chef Yan is the best English  plus Cooking Inspiration of all time ❤️ My mom said she met Chef Yen on the street a few times in our neighbourhood. And that Peking Duck he introduced looks Legit with 4 standard dishes❤
Martin Yan is an ABSOLUTE LENGEND! Love going back and watching him just for his jokes.
Thanks!  Thank you for bringing back fond memories for me.
In Canada, we had Wok with Yan with a different guy that always had Wok puns lol I never saw Martin Yan till the late 90s on Food Network.
I like that you also had clip of made with Lau. I have used his mongolian beef recipe
I'd view Mr. Yan on PBS in the 80s.  Learned how to make Soy Sauce Chicken in Elementary from him.  The whole Family whole gather around the TV to learn and share. All of the PBS Cooking shows opened my eyes to the World's Cuisines.
OH. I REMEMBER THIS ONE! ! !
I loved watching this show as a kid!!
My childhood was watching this dude and super sabado sensational
I watched Martin Yan all the time as a child, he was the best. Funny and talented he made you feel like you could be a great chef.
I loved this show as a kid! Martin Yan is definitely one of my heroes too. When Uncle Roger says cook with feeling, Yan is exactly who I think of!
Pekin Duck at our local Chinatown Restaurant is $41.50 …. Chinatown Kalispell MT
7:30 uncle Roger never been to Quanjude in Beijing...hiyaaahhhh. can order without notice because that's all they serve
"Everything get more expensive  but my salary stay the same" Bruh I didn't need that reminder right now
I heard the excitement!!
Yes! Yan! He inspired me to want to learn to cook when no one else around did. Loved the show so much
His restaurant on the Vegas strip, M.Y. Asia didn’t even last 6 months before closing already.
spent 4 years in Hong Kong and yan can cook was on all the time. I Arrived in Hong Kong at the age of 11. I'm a Chef now due to my childhood. Fantastic food. Loved watching him when i was young. Stiil watch his stuff now.
"OH! LOOK AT THAT" Love Martin Yan!
I loved watching his show when I was a kid.
Haiyaa... This dish not from Genghis Kahn, it from his brother, Ahmeri Kahn... Everyone should know, because Ahmeri also make fortune cookie 🥠
ahhhh your ex wife  LMAO !!!
This video left me speachless the corn starch bid with the express vpn is the most random thing ive ever seen on this channel. Corn starch, msg, orgasm, good rice, express vpn, everything expensive and cant afford cable. So random.
Finally, I've been waiting for you to review the legendary Mr Yan (I have no right to call him Martin), I used to always watch his show as a kid. Surely you cannot call him anything less than 'Uncle Martin'
My memory always conflates Yan can Cook (Martin) with Wok with Yan (Stephen). I enjoyed both shows.
i like the new one piece live action show
Two steps away from Japanese porn hahahahahahaha
This wedjeo so grainy like old school Minecraft…instead of 4K it etch-a-sketch”K”
The first blooper😂😂😂
His Knife skills are his calling card
Always thought true Mongolian Beef was cooked on a circular grill made of multiple iron bands...
What a sweetie
Cancelled for calling Taiwan not a country? No, you'll actually mysteriously make gains with the current situation, I'd guess. It's a mystery, though, who knows why that happens.
Uncle Roger, how about a review of the OG Uncle Wok with Yan?
Uncle Yan made me want to learn to cook Chinese food. As a young teen I asked for a hand hammered carbon steel wok and proper cooking utensils for my birthday so I could cook like Martin. I still just that same wok and utensils today while I make all sorts of Chinese dishes for my family.
What's lost in all this is that Uncle Roger low-key indirectly praised Panda Express and PF Changs.  The stuff we tend to turn up our noses at because it's not "authentic"
Yan can cook was an absolute classic. When we were kids we'd watch the whole show just waiting for "If Yan can cook, so can you!"
You should get sponsored by an air conditioning manufacturer.
Sounds like the first p*rn* I ever watched off a vhs 🤣🤣
I grew up watching Wok with Yan and Yan can cook. I didn't realize it was two different people. I thought the latter was a reboot of the first one
I see the video references Cook with Lau. Will there be a review on Chef Lau soon?
“If Yan can cook, so can you!” This is why Kay’s cooking and Jamie Oliver exist 😅
My childhood ❤
Uncle roger pls cosplay like sanji from one piece when review a egg fried rice
Hayiaaa Uncle roger so Scared of his ex wife he even through the towl away.
I always thought Martin Yan is Filipino when I saw him on tv in the early 90s
Yes! I loved watching Martin Yan before I even ever thought of cooking.
Uncle Roger need an AC😂
I met kow fu Yan many times in SF Chinatown. He's the real deal although my mom, bless her heart, would always critique his dishes but that's what old school Chinese moms did. The Bin-Pei gnapp was much better in Sun-Hui (China) in my opinion compared to HK's Hing Lung.
8:13 jumpscare
🤗🤗🤗
used to watch yan can cook when i was a kid on public access tv along with the cajun justin wilson i think his name was both were awesome
Yes! This Made my day. I watched Martin Yan my whole childhood and he influenced my cooking, my kitchen etiquette and humor. When I used to work as a chef it was one of my great joys introducing people to Yan (usually with his incredible chicken processing skills) and having the whole kitchen doing their tasks while exclaiming "so eaaasy, see! So eaaasy!" Martin Yan is truly one of a very few likable TV chefs.
More Yan can cook! He's the coolest
i alwas understand " cocain oil " kekw
I loved watching him on pbs back in the early 90s!!!!! Him and two fat ladies
"inflation is bullshit" wisest words Uncle Roger has said. also Uncle Yen is wholesome af
Sadly I didn't learn about Martin Yan till he did a cooking challenge against Emeril on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He was my hero ever since
Uncle Roger, please look for The Galloping Gourmet and review his occasional Asian cooking. He's an English man. His series was on American TV back in the 70's.  I guarantee you'll like it.
“FUIYOOOOOO, guaranteed orgasm.” 🤣😂 Uncle Roger is a #LEGEND 🫡
Martin Yan actually just copied the Canadian TV show Wok with Yan which starred Stephen Yan.  They are not related.
This was one of my favorite shows. Ming take notes
Back when Martin Yan and Justin Wilson were the kings of TV chefs, and when Hong Kong was still Hong Kong.  Man the world sucks now.
If “vegetable taste like sad”, then why do you like green onions? Lol!
Yan can cook...and so can YOU! GOOD NIGHT!
nobody noticing the towel he used to wipe his sweat @7:47?? LMAOOO THAT THE REAL ASIAN TOWEL
Yan can Cook!….  Uncle Rodger should never disrespect this legend!….  Learn your place!… You should wash, and clean his dishes!….  You have not inspired a generation!….  Go wash his dishes, Noob!…. 💯💯💯
actually I also love listening to kitchen ASMR :D (like the chopping) lol
He was my favorite chef growing up because I finally felt represented on the TV screen plus his energy is so great and positive like how can u not like him
Did you see the earlier Canadian show "Wok with Yan"? He was the original uncle.
Wooden chopping board ASMR would ne a thing now.
I remember Yan Can Cook.  I was too young to appreciate it.
Growing up in Puerto Rico I used to watch Mr Yan at noon on cable tv 😂, I was a kid didn’t cook nothing but that man had charisma and was entertaining as heck 👌
"Look at dat."  I miss watching this guy.
Chef Yan seems like such a fantastic person! <3 I've never heard of him before, but he seems like the Bob Ross of cooking Also loved that quick shout out to Made With Lau. Their channel is great too!
Yan can cook is OG, he dont sound like you, you just imitate him. Mic drop.
Uncle Roger ..Big fan of yours....I feel sad when you sweat ....😞Pls consider buying Air conditioner for your room😢😭
I grew up on “if Yan can cook so can you.” I never learn anything til Uncle Roger came along
Poor uncle roger he watch too much jamie oliver niw just listening to smooth chopping that don't impress asian parent makes him relaxed, haiyaa uncle roger gonna be the most impressed asian parent and he doing all of this for us, thank you!
I remember watching Yan Can Cook every week on public tv in the 80’s. I even picked up a great Chinese little red book - no, not that one  - a Yan Can Cook book. Still have it today. Little worn, but just as valuable.
Uncle Roger you have 9 million subscribers YET will not buy air conditioner.  HIYAAA
❤ Martian Yan is a gift to this world that we don't deserve to have.
I was in my 30s when Martin Yan's cooking show first came out.  My mom and I absolutely loved his show and his sense of humor.
Yan is the original version of Auguste Gustaue  from ratatouille. If I can cook so can you!  And he truly brought the best flavors into the homes of people who never knew they loved those flavors.
Martin Yan is the GOAT.
Martin Yan was the first TV cook I remember watching when I was very young.
MONGOLIAN BBQ IS FROM TAIWAN
I used to wake up at like 5 am to watch wok with Yan when i was in kindergarten lol. Legend!
i remember wok-with-yan cooking show... it was good also 👌
glad to see you're back in blighty sweating like the rest of us 😂
I loved watching Yan Can Cook back in the day! This was awesome.
That credit score joke was brilliant
One thing I see funny about him is that he has a cooking book called "Chinese cooking for Dummies”. Jamie Oliver really needs that book.
Uncle Roger: Drops a new video. Me: Yaya.
I LOVE Yan Can Cook! And Wok With Yan! I used to watch his T.V. shows when I was a kid. 😀
i grew up watching martin yan.
I loved watching his show in the 80s
Are we just gonna ignore the fact Uncle Roger hasn't done one single review of Daddy Lau?😂
I grew up watching Martin Yen too. Always loved this guy and his show.
Yan is the OG, I'd love to see him again!
Hope you can meet him, Uncle Roger
The jab to nationalist Chinese extremists who refuse to acknowledge Taiwan as a country was cathartic.
I would LOVE to use express vpn to finish thriller bark arc and move on to other one piece episodes, but im so young and i dont have phone number or credit card, haiyahh
Uncle Lau even made it to a Uncle Roger video ^_^
Fully agree 💝 The sound of the wok and clever are my ASMR 😅
I'm  older than uncle Roger . He likely never saw our Yan  who was on tv in british colombia canada in the 1970's.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok_with_Yan. This other yan was very similar with corny jokes
What if Jamie Oliver and Uncle Roger collab?! Fancy!
Martin Yan introduced the world that Chinese food wasn’t just fried rice and chow mein.  Martin Yan is a legend and the only person on tv with an Asian face in the 80’s and 90’s.
OH MAN ...MARTIN YAN was on PBS and we'd watch him up in Canada all the time!!! Freaking ACTION BRONSON LOVES HIM!!! 'If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!' LEGEND!!! ULTIMATE LEGEND!!!!
what happened? uncle roger doesn't evaluate strictly here anymore, he just says yes, this or that ingredient is optional?! wow XD
Please more videos of him uncle rogers
I adore Martin Yan. Every time he was a guest on something I watched it including Hell's Kitchen. Yan Can Cook was one of my favorite shows. I learned a lot from him.
Wow what a throwback, my parents have 2-3 of his smaller cookbooks in my house that look more like laminated pamphlets really and I don't think I've seen his actual program but he was quite a household name while I was growing up in the 90's still. Thank you again for such a lovely video/review and I hope your A/C situation gets better!
if 74 years old yan really collab with uncle roger this will be legendary
Yan was one of the OGs that I loved to watch on Public Access TV
The cleaver ASMR is 🤌, could listen to that all day and the sizzling.   I really wish I still had my vintage Yan can cook cookbook.
I met Uncle Martin in the '90s...
Grew up watching Martin Yen and Graham Kerr on TV.  Good stuff
Can't wait for chef Martin to react to this! 🔪🫡
This absolutely takes me back to being six, seven years old - even younger, watching Chef Yanks shows after school.
The Taiwan joke coming full circle is absolutely beautiful. <3
Use to watch his show in 80’s and 90’s. Loved it.
Nigel, get AC! Nobody want to watch you sweat.
Uncle Yan really is the GOAT. if there is a Hall of Fame, he would get it with no doubts. ❤
"He even sound like Uncle Roger"  Fun fact:  The way Martin Yan spoke on his TV show was an affectation.
Fun fact : Taiwan is an independent country
A true Tv Chef and Legend Martin Yan, not like some of the quacks we have now.
I loved him as a kid.
Please review more of Uncle Martin. He’s such a legend!!
That Chinese uncle is so cute. And his cooking my god. My mouth is watering
LOVED watching Yan Can Cook when I was a little girl!  The best 💜
Ichiban approved
ive piked the duck befor
Your screams at the end sounded like a crow. Haha please do more of these videos of Yan!
Any hate towards Martin Yan and you’ll be banned from America too
I so loved watching Yan can cook back then. One of the top rated shows in Canada
Uncle Roger, can we bring back the K-pop session? I want to feel special and fancy! 😂
Uncle Roger turned into a crow at the end there 😂
Loved this! Do more Yan can  Cook Uncle Roger.
0:05 yan can cook
Smh, still can't understand why ppl recommend one piece when it has 37 seasons
Man can afford a hair transplant but not air conditioning 💀
My host family in China were foodies so one of the highlights were when they occasionally took me to restaurants that specialised in 北京烤鸭 peking duck. The chefs always cut the meet very gently in front of the customers. There was always an apprentice learning by oberserving the chef. The mandarin pancakes they served were about half the size of what they showed in this 80s show.  If you have the chance to get peking duck, go for it. It is really delicious!
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook with my mom.  Absolutely loved watching Martin Yan cook in the afternoons after school.  We did cook a few of the things he fixed and loved it.
These 2 men share the same soul.
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook and Martin Yan's other shows.  He is truly one of my favorite chefs!
Yan Can Cook and Price is Right were two of my sick day favorites
I remember Yan can cook
Can you do Wok With Yan? he’s the OG before Yan Can Cook. And also Chef Fu Pei Mei, she’s like the Asian Julia Child 😊
Heard a parrot on bloopers LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
This brought back so many memories! Martin Yan started his career in Canada on a local television station. I grew up watching episodes with my grandparents when I was visiting them. His cookbook was the first one I bought when I started cooking on my own. The OG Yan Can Cook cookbook has some great recipes in it!
He show premiered in the 1980's but THIS episode is clearly from the late 90's or early 2000's
I used to watch Yan Can Cook with my Dad! When I decided I wanted to be a chef he bought me my first cookbook, and it was by him. ❤
TBH, Mr Roger. With +8M subscirbers, you could cut down a bit your sponsors time (not saying to stop it). Maybe just my opinion but it's getting annoyed when just a year ago it was "understandable". Greed leeds to ruin, eventually
How did you find a Yan video? I was looking for the whole series recently, but couldn't find it.
Also watched Martin Yan in my youth. Great introduction to Chinese food prep. Glad to see he is still putting out cooking content at 72 - Instagram and Youtube. When he gets his new restaurant open in San Francisco, Uncle Roger should try to collab with him for a vid!
Makes me wanna see Uncle Roger review PBS cooking shows.
Was born in 1971.   Martin Yan is awesome and a life saver.  Moved to Alaska in 1982, was one of the few shows that we got.   When i joined the Army in 1989, used to watch his show when stationed in Korea.  He fostered an enjoyment in cooking and learning about dishes that has helped me to this day.   Awesome episode,  he is one of the OGs.
Nice 'made with lau' reference.
I grew up watching the Yan's - Yan Can Cook and Wok with Yan! Both great shows!
When my family moved to Canada catching Yan Can Cook, Wok With Yan were what made me fall in love with cooking shows and cooking!
0.1k video i'm dead 😂😂😂😂
Cornstarch plus MSG = METH  Making Everything Taste  Holy
Yan is the man!
"Including Taiwan" 😂 Much love from Taiwan Uncle Roger ❤️
Old-school 🎉🎉🎉
"STIR fry, not STARE fry!" fuiyoh, this man is great!!!
I wonder if an episode with him and gordon will be wonderful
Fuiyoh! When are you gonna get an Air-Con Uncle Roger
I had his cookbook back in the days :)
Hayiaa Uncle Roger only chsnnel i actually skip back to see ad!
Did I really just watch Uncle Roger say that chili is optional ??
@chefmartinyan
Legit, every time i stayed home sick as a kid i would watch cops, price is right and yan can cook!!
West Taiwan 1:07? :-o
I recommend that you look at Chef Stephen Yang - Martin used to work for him. Stephen did a TV show in Vancouver in the 70s and 80s.
This Martin Yan episode is from the 90's
You should check out his Canadian counterpart "Wok with Yan!"
Chef Martin was my first! I fell in love with his food immediately!+ You are hilarious Uncle!❤
Ooo. Next review an episode of "Wok with Yan"
I grew up watching "Yan Can Cook".  I can't cook, but he sure could.  And he made it look Soooooo easy.  I miss that show.
This is going to be HARD to watch! Yan Can Cook was my uncle's FAVORITE cooking show!
Made my first egg fried rice last night thanks to Uncle Roger. Fuiyoh!!!
Its like saying gambling can
Why did he say genghis kaan
Hmmm
We saw uncle Yan has at least two woks which makes him...
Martin YAN, my childhood!
Martin Yan spoke at my culinary school graduation in SF. His show was  a huge influence on me as a kid.
In Canada, we had Wok With Yan. It was the best show.
If you want the REAL OG Uncle, try Stephen Yan's "Wok with Yan". https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=wok+with+yan
My Saturday as a child
Thanks for making this video, Uncle Roger! Uncle Yan is one of my hero’s growing up. I saw Uncle Yan a few days ago in San Francisco. Although he showed his age like his 80s cooking videos, he presents himself like he is on air. So no change there.   Come back to San Francisco Bay Area, Uncle Roger! I would love to see a collab with you and him, and share this wonder to people in 21th century!
In reality, if Yan can cook, it doesnt you can. This legend here has skills and experience that many of us dont even in our dreams.
what website is he on when showing parasite?
uncle roger, when you first saw auntie helen, what was it about her that you fell in love with? 😂
As long as its delicious it honors the great khan
I was a weird little kid in the late 80's. During the summer break I would always watch the cooking shows that would be on PBS well around lunchtime. I would eat my lunch and watch people cook. I LOVED Yan can cook. He was so nice and silly and he always taught you some food history as well. Dude is a legend to me. Uncle Roger needs to react to Martin's "de-boning a chicken in 20 seconds" videos. He did it a lot so there are tons of versions but definetly try to find the older version from his TV show. People think they have knife skills? YAN has knife skills.
i would watch this OG Uncle all the time back when I ditched school lol
My OG Asian cooking show was Wok With Yan with Stephen Yan (no relation) which was a Canadian show in the 70s and ran through the 80s on CBC.
Another chef from the 80s you might want to check out is Stephan Yan (no relation to Martin Yan). He had a show called Wok with Yan.
Bring flavor to America! You obviously never eaten soul food.
Hello Uncle Roger, please do for reactions on Martin Yan’s videos
Why is he cooking the spoon tho?
I used to watch Yan Can Cook! I lived in IA though, so I had no hope of getting the ingredients.
Yen was before my time but now ima binge watch every video i cam find!😂
Ah Uncle Roger not actually a chef. I Google. Just take piss,know nothing about food
I remember watching this guy as a kid and just being transfixed by his knife skills.
Loved Yan Can Cook...and all the cooking shows back in the day.
@6:50 The oil was not hot enough to pop the cellophane noodles. If it was, the noodles would pop up instantly into something large enough to cover the whole plate.
Reminded me of Sat morning watching pbs when I was a kid. One of my favorite shows!
No "sorry children?" Haiyaa
Have you ever heard of the Canadian version "WOK WITH YAN"? Check him out.
Brings back great memories Watching this as a kid in Canada.
Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan were just two of the many cooking shows I watched in my youth.
Cooking with Lau! I'm glad you showed him there as the other dude.
Check out "Wok with Yan". It was a show I grew up with here in Vancouver. Different Yan, same yum!
I'm going through a really hard breakup, and this upload made my day, I and many other people appreciate your content more than you know uncle Roger <3
Grew up watching Martin Yan as a kid in the 80s, the nostalgia is strong ☺️
Yan is the root of my cooking :)
I loved watching Yan can cook!  “If Yan cook, so can you!”
I watched Yan Can Cook when I was a kid.  True OG.
I would encourage you to check out this guy and do a critique of his shows.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok_with_Yan
Up here in Canada we had Stephen Yan of 'Wok with Yan'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok_with_Yan
1:40 didn't know that
I use to watch yan can Cook when I was a little kid all the time
1:38   I love this channel, too. I was introduce to Cooking With Lau when I was searching for a carbon steel chinese slicer.
Before Martin Yan there was Stephen Yan with the show Wok With Yan. Martin Yan was working for Stephen Yan in the 1980's
I LOVE MARTIN !!!   I used to watch him all the time on Public TV !!!
Dish was perhaps not as widely available back then... 🫣 (sorry, just started the video, 1 min in) 🙈 Will stfu now 😅
My favorite cooking show growing up.  I actually saw him promoting his book in Texas about 20 years ago. I didn't know what was going on, and I was standing right next to him prior to him going up to the platform.
Thank you so much, Uncle Roger, for bringing the awesomeness that is Martin Yan to a new generation. I grew up with him and loved him, watching this is so nostalgic. He is such a great entertainment chef. And he still is with his YouTube channel! <3 <3
I used to watch yan can cook as a child, he introduced me to cooking and flavors that actually have seasoning 😂. Cause white people are afraid of flavor.
In Canada we had Wok With Yan! Different Yan. I was a little kid & loved to watch him.
This episode is from the mid 90's... Just by his haircut. I recently found a compilation playlist on the YT channel, KQCD, and he had a Miami Vice Don Johnson haircut back in his earliest episodes.
I have for cleavers and I love Chinese knives.
I watched Yan Can Cook a bunch while growing up.  I like that he makes it simple and talks thru the steps with some comedy.  Too many of the older cooking shows were very bland and just straight forward recipe recitations.
Really liked watching Martin Yan, a Hong Kong-American chef and host of his his award-winning PBS-TV cooking show Yan Can Cook since 1982.
lol social credits
Legend
Sounds of Chinese Cleaver chopping. Uncle Roger's: 😊❤ US Vietnam Veterans Soldier: ☠️
Sounds of Chinese Cleaver chopping. Uncle Roger's: 😊❤ US Vietnam Veterans Soldier: ☠️
Yam was a big inspiration to me because… If Yan can cook, so can you
When I was a kid and had to miss school I used to watch cooking shows on PBS with my dad. Definitely remember watching “Yan Can Cook” alongside Julia Child and Ming Tsai.
I remember watching Yan Can Cook! Entertaining and informative😊
Please collab with uncle Martin Yan!!!!!
Oh man, I lived in Singapore for all the 90s and tv channels were pretty limited but they did a good job of curating shows. Given Singapore was/is a food paradise they had a lot of cooking shows. The best were all the Keith Floyd series and Yam Can Cook. I could watch him do his thing then go straight to a good hawker centre and get the same dish. Early interactive tv.
Martin Yan is my hero as well.
pleaseeeee more of uncle yan
I loved Yan can cook! One of my chefs in school used to prep for him 😂 super sweet
I used to watch Martin Yan in the late 80’s, he really was one of the best tv chefs out there ❤ now I’m going to listen to some disco
Chef Yan had skilz.
Shrimp paste is delicious and I don't know why so many caucasians dislike it.  🦐 Delicious  👬🏻 Disgusting
I used to love watching his show! He made up the story  about where Mongolian Beef came from; lol!😂
I used to watch Yan Can Cook when I was growing up. His show exposed me to many different foods I didn’t know existed as a child
Just saw a Reddit post hating Uncle Rodger. Here’s the thing most are mad because the accent and all that. PEOPLE DONT YOU KNOW HES A COMEDIAN AND THATS WHAT THEY DO! Hell look at South Park they make fun of everyone. This generation is the worst and wants to cancel everything. It’s a damn joke people! Stop being as soft as Jaime Oliver HIYAHHHHH. Just laugh and be happy, don’t be old, wrinkled, and miserable. It’s not a big deal, it’s entertainment. Don’t like, don’t watch! Love ya Uncle Rodger and I’d like Uncle Title. I will defend you till the death!
Yan is the man!
I love Yan Can Cook, I used to watch it all the time. 😊
Uncle Roger watches One Piece.....FUIYOH
The smile at 1:10 tho 😂
I grew up watching this show
2023 HIV not bad...MSG will kill you
That Peking Duck Carver is amazing! Fuiyoh!
Love Uncle Rodger but why does he sweat so much? It’s the biggest mystery in the world.
This was really probably like 1997 if we're honest
Yan and ming  Tsai were absolute legends
Whats your favorite hoisin sauce?
i love this show growing i didnt have cable  but he was on PBS great show
is it just me or is uncle yen the cook version of bob ross?
OMG, I grew up watching Martin Yan back then! So cool to see Uncle Roger watching Martin's old videos!
I remember watching Yan Can Cook on PBS as a teen in the 90s.  I consider him as great as the other cooking greata like Julia Child.
After all these videos uncle still has no air conditioning haiiiya, uncle Roger poor.
i  remember watching him a lot
YAN CAN COOK!!! And after school classic!!
In Taiwan, the program is named 甄能煮, which is kinda pun because the pronunciation of 甄 is equal to 真 (means real(ly)) in traditional Chinese and therefore the title of the program means Yan can cook and really can cook well at the same time🎉😊
Uncle Roger, review another OG Uncle from the 80's, Stephen Yan of Wok With Yan...
Uncle Roger here's a can of worms for you to open review some of the Julia Child videos making asian food.
Uncle Roger is rich haiyaaaa.... Peking duck in 80's is considered a luxury
Hello Uncle Roger! I think if you're going to advertise VPN you should say that you can use it to watch PH in your country without being scared of government
Nigel Ng was a young boy in the 80's not Uncle Roger. Uncle Roger is an top old G.
Uncle Roger I found a Jamie Oliver Christmas cook book at work today and I said "We can't sell this I'm tossing it in the trash better yet I'll burn it the trash is to good to be polluted with Jamie's shit cooking"
Now you have to do Stephen Yan from Canada. I originally thought that's who Uncle Roger was a parody of.
I loved this show , just throw the dam thing in 😂
Use to love watching his show n still use some of his sayings
Nice one uncle Roger, going back in time 👍😊
Don't wok away, we'll be right back!
I used to watch him all the time after school on PBS.
$3 for Netflix in india.
Fuiyoh!! Uncle Roger bringing us the freshest content, and it's from the eighties! Yan was so awesome!
I watched him and Stephen Yan (Wok with Yan) all the time!  So great!
He was great, I used to watch him every day after school.    He was so much fun, and after watching him one learned his system.    His wonder powder, magic powder and the like.  Seasoned his oil.  Use chopsticks to test that the oil is hot enough..... shrimp chips.... it was great stuff.
Uncle Martin is the uncle that you take his stories with a grain of MSG. Who cares if it's "true" it's a good story
dope.
Martin Yan is the best! I wish someone would take over production of his latest streams, though. The audio is practically nonexistent and someone keeps filming them in portrait mode.
oh man that Taiwan joke was on fire!!!!
But you is blind.,..😂
This is the first episode I watched as a kid and been in love with Mongolian beef ever since
In Morse Code, Uncle Martin's cleaver says, "I have an MBA from Stanford and my accent is put on." Love you Uncle!
Trying to get unblocked in China I see..
He was obviously drawing us into the cooking with the stories! Genius! Americans are something else. He let new people feel comfortable trying something new, thats special!
Remember him always saying Set Aside
Yan was the first cooking show I can remember. I was 6 yrs old and I liked it. Probably why I love to cook.
I'm pretty sure the quarter of our population doesn't have any idea what corn starch is as a Mongolian
And if you want to go real old school, before Martin Yan, there was Titus Chan.
Unfortunately his show was on about 20 years before I would even think about learning to cook.  It must have been a real eye opener for a time when there was no internet or even Chinese cookbooks widely available.
9:44 I do😊 12:25 😂😂😂😂
Grew up on Yan Can Cook on PBS. I still yell every time I smack garlic on the cutting board!! lol
Uncle Yan is legendary!
Please review chef jhon one of popular chineese chef
believe it or not, but Uncle Yan was so popular back in the 80s and 90s, that even the young me back in the middle east who never even seen chinese food used to watch him of tv and loved him a lot and i adored so much his mongolian beef that i swore that when i grow up and find a chinese restaurant, i would have it as my first dish, and i did, and i was so happy, thank u Unlce Yan, wonder if u know that u are loved even in arab countries.
Someone send this to Jamie Oliver...  I have his knife...
Not enough noodles.......
Studio 1 is looking sharp!
Best bbq Chinese duck in Texas is at Din Ho in Austin.  We'd sing about Din Ho in the parking lot after eating there.  Best meal of my life...  Garlic, ginger, and butter dungeoness crab there.  Eeeasily.
if you think this is good you need to see some more recent ones from Martin Yan.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s789XITITG0
STARE FRY WILL BURN!
I have a cookbook signed by him!!
Legend! remember watching with my family! this made me so happy... thanks Uncle Roger... tap in to these classics some more please!
I watched thai video in 240 p to respect and match the vibe of video
Let's wok on the moon.
Thanks @uncleroger
7:50 I remember those towels!!! Wah memory lane! 80s towels. Nice attention to detail.
Need more reactions on him
Actually it's not a chinese American dish but a dish made by a man named wu who fled beijin to Taiwan and invented it and yes it does have some elements of Mongolia inspired. Also on your comment uncle Roger about adding ginger. The ginger takes away the flavor from the entire dish. The emphasis wants to be on beef flavor. As for making the dish sweet the hoisin sauce is already sweet so no need for sugar.
I really appreciate you covering Martin Yan. He was the first TV cook I ever saw as a kid and I remember enjoying watching him cook.
I remember when I went to saw him live went with my mom and brother was actually pretty cool to watch him cook we always watch him on TV
Hey Uncle Roger, is that a Good morning towel you're using??? 😂😂😂
Just starting the video, it this doesn't go well we are going to have a problem Uncle Roger... Martin Yan is a saint. I got to meet him when I was about 10, he was so kind and funny. He and Julia Child were my favorite people on TV when I was a kid.
I loved Yen Can Cook!!!
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook.  I loved watching him for his recipes and humor.
Just like us. Nothing is ever wasted😊.
If corn starch is so important to Chinese cooking how did they cook before America started shipping them ass loads of corn??? Seems like a lot of Chinese people doing American cooking to say nothing about peppers! Also Tomatoes are not from the meditation, Columbus discovered marinara and stole it from the Indians with everything else.
How to come up with your child's name in China? Throw a metal bowl down the stairs. LOL!
that uncle roger dad
He also had challenges with other tv chefs on who could cut up a whole chicken the fastest.
I grew up watching all of his series on PBS. Uncle Yan has great knife skills and I also love the sound of Chinese cleaver work. Probably my favorite would be Uncle Wang Gang, dropping beats with his blade or blades.
I purchased my first wok and cleaver because of Yan can Cook 🙏
Tio Alberto will give sobrino Rogelio - nephew Roger free joke - television in the 80s is so grainy it's like a gluten free donut in the eye😐
Keep working on that social score!!
This guy was one of the best parts of my childhood. Every weekend, I'd sit with my mom and watch his show. Martin Yan was the one who started my love of cooking.
I thought he said dirty 7 series 😭
Mongolian beef is so good
I totally forgot a out Yan Can Cook! I use to watch it all the time as a kid with my grandparents!
Martin Yan is my favorite! He cooked meat in dough instead of clay pot!
I remember two shows on Chinese cooking in the 80s; "Yan Can Cook" and "A Wok Through China." I watched them both when I was young.
i use to watch him in the 90's
Man, I am a bit sad that the pronunciation of "Genghis Khan" gets completely butchered every time. Yes, none of us ever taught you guys on the internet, we're too rare to be bumped into.  Yes, I am Mongolian. Mutton is the staple meat, and you should look the meals up. They are extremely simple, since they're for everyone, not just rich people.
Core memory unlocked. My mom used to watch all the cooking shows when I was a kid. I look them up on here from time to time when I want to connect a little to those days.
LOOK AT THIS!! GOLDEN BROWN!!!
6:56 every time I see that plate, I know the food will be impeccable.
Loved Martin Yan! Met him several times and he's as friendly in person as these videos.
Martin Yan came into my local grocery store when i was a teenager. I watched him as a kid cause we only had like 14 channels and he was on every morning. So when he came into the store I was so fucking excited. He came to pick up some meats at the butcher and he said hello!
Omfg! I remember this guy, he was brilliant.
ok so, when is Uncle Roger gonna reviewing Taiwanese food
Martin yen is basically uncle Roger. Both comedians with racist accents 😂 They made up.
Chef/host Yan should receive a title even more prestigious than "Uncle"!!      maybe like Martial Uncle,  Grand cook, Master Uncle, Boss Uncle, etc   I don't have very good title suggestion, choose yourself
My ma and i used to watch him when i was little, we loved him so much! "If Yan can, you can!" What a legend ❤
Hell yes Martin Yan! Absolute legend. Love him to bits! If yan can cook, so can you is indelibly imprinted on my soul.
You are asian😂❤ carryminati 😊🇮🇳
Thank your respective Gods he brought flavor to America. And blessed us with MSG.
I love Yan Can Cook!!!!
2:53 I'll say it again but louder this time...   *STOP USING VPNS TO WATCH REGION LOCKED CONTENT!!* You're gonna make VPNs illegal for everyone!  Don't give them an excuse!!  Haiyaaa...... 😓
Oh my goodness! I remember this guy! I would watch him all the time. While all my friends were watching Mr. Rodger, I was watching Martin Yan and Bob Ross 😂
Martin Yan should do another season of Chinatown.  Hopefully, this attention bump can make it happen!
It was great seeing Martin on the screen again, those old shows were fantastic
do you all realize martin yan only has just over 5000 subscribers on youtube even though he is legitimately a TV legend? America grew up with martin yan
OMG blast from the past! I remember when I was growing up, Martin Yan used to do a cooking show in Cantonese, too, that was popular with HK expats in North America. My mom used to watch it. The tone was very different, but also showing how to make restaurant-style dishes -- it would be the dishes favored by Hong Kongers IRL. No theatrics there, just good cooking.
This man is still around.. uncle roger reach out to him and I would LOVE to see that video
I used to work for a half Chinese/half Cambodian dude name John.  He introduced me to Yan can cook after we went in on a rice cooker for the office kitchen.  He also was able to shoot flies with rubber bands out of midair.  Basically  my Miyagi.
If you're watching Yan Can Cook in the 80s, I on the other hand was watching his rival that was much loved with the kids "Wok With Yan" Stephen Yan was my favorite chef when I was just 6 years old. I love all his jokes and how he sculpts all the vegetables into birds and flovers 😊
Uncle roger not only funny he gives great advice as well 🎉
Did you know Sanji from One piece Netflix adaptation got cooking lessons from Jamie Oliver? I wonder when uncle roger will review that.
6:32 for the love of god, don't google "e621"
I watched Martin Yan all the time as a kid. He was funny, with his cheesy dad jokes and toothy grin.
I don't know if Martin Yan's videos are available as reruns somewhere. He was/is great. I remember seeing his show very late at night or odd times of the day, and I wish I had seen more. He was always good. You learned something, he was funny, and the food was clearly great. If his show is on disc or scrtreaming, that would be awesome.
j
Used to watch him every saturday morning on PBS instead of cartoons.  Dude is a legend!
As a kid as i used to watch this show religiously.  Inspired my love for cooking and Asian cuisine.  Became a chef because of Yan
Oh man. My grandmother introduced me to Yan Can Cook. So many memories.
Awesome! I loved watching Yan Can Cook! Peking duck is so delicious! Now I want to go get some!
Justin childs    the new Orleans ajun chef.
I used to love watching his show when I was a child, he made cooking so fun
Is this a hint for an upcoming collaboration? That would be the greatest video ever. I spent my early childhood (94/97) watching repeats of Yan Can Cook in the UK and his show always takes me back to that time, being off school sick and watching early afternoon TV in the '90s. Lovely memories. If I'm not mistaken there was another famous cooking show from that time, though I can't remember the name of it. I don't think it was Ken Hom but I could be mistaken...
If Yan can cook so can u too uncle Roger
Sir Yan or Jamie Oliver?
"And then!"
Fuiyoh, Martin Yan is a legend.  Happy childhood memories unlocked, he still has a show if I remember correctly.  We need a Martin Yan and uncle roger collaboration video at some point both in the same kitchen.
I saw Uncle Yan many years ago and got one of his cook books.  Great cooking show live and on PBS. Thanks Uncle Roger for bringing this back.
Yan can cook was one of my favorite childhood cooking shows.
I have good childhood memories of watching this show with my family. My dad liked cooking using his recipes.
Never seen uncle Roger simp this hard for a man before
WOW! Expressvpn charges $22 a month? On special? Holy F!! None of all the others charges more than $4!!
I know he's just playing it up for the camera but Genghis Khan would have never even seen a bell pepper (or any pepper for that matter). Peppers wouldn't be seen in Mongolia for at least 300 years after his death (1206)
Wok with Yan was the first cooking show I ever saw as a tiny child and started my whole foodie life.
I like how many times he had to practise his jump scare scene to make it look more original.😂😂
Uncle Roger... Cook something.
I used to love watching Yan.
I used to watch Ken years ago. He's where I learned "Hot pan. Cold OIl. Food never stick!" And the best part is all of his episodes are available on Youtube.
Lol omg I forgot about Yan Can Cook! I watched those growing up too!
Does anyone feels that uncle roger and young Martin yan  kind of lookalike?
Let's not forget "Wok With Yan", another great Chinese TV chef that we had here in Canada!  His t-shirts were legendary as well, another true Uncle!
me and my dad would watch Martin Yan on PBS when i was a kid. he introduced my immigrant father to chinese flavors and my dad would try and recreate them at home. Martin Yan is a legend.
I remember Friday nights, my local PBS station had this block of cooking shows for around 3-4 hours, and Martin Yan was always a favorite because his show was entertaining compared to a lot of the boring shows around it (I was a kid. I didn't care about recipes the same way I do now.)  Dude both was and still is a fucking master and legend.
I used to always watch Simply Ming by Ming Tsai growing up <3
Great episode, finally a nod to my old favorite face from the days of public access, long before YouTube. Mad respect to the legendary OG Martin Yan!
me as a old car mechanic like asmr people building a engine no speaking just tool sounds i love it
If yan can cook, so can you!  I loved his show
If Uncle Roger is down for Martin Yan, he needs to check out Martin's uncle Stephen Yan's Wok With Yan. Martin started out working on that show. For all who love MSG, Take a Wok on the Wild Side.
Loved watching Yan Can Cook when I was a kid. Anyone remember when he did a crossover episode with the microwave cooking guy?
Mongolia is not fucking china ffs
I grew up in the 80s  and 90s watching Yan Can Cook
I grew up on Yan Can Cook. Food was so good and his skills were so fun and dynamic. Mom made some similar recipes. She used Accent, Caribbean MSG.
Uncle Roger, you're wrong about MSG. I was in high school and college in the 80s. MSG was in the best fast food. 🙂
Not A Fan Of One Piece But Yess Anime Version Is Better Than Live Action Because Live Action They Going F Up Some How
"If Yan can cook, so can you ". If you automatically repeat this phrase, We're old already.
i love this side of uncle roger
Oh my goodness. Talk about a blast from the past. I used to watch Yan Can Cook every day after school. He was one of my earliest cooking influences. Great man.
I was thinking it was Wok With Yan, a Canadian cooking show from the '70s with Stephen Yan, instead of Martin Yan, from the American 80s show.
Uncle Roger would eat that, 🤣 don't let auntie Esther hear you say that, and remember if Yan can cook you can too 👌
If the channel reaches 9 million subs Uncle Roger should do weejio with Martin Yan.
The crazy thing is I actually remember watching this episode when I was a kid
I watched Yan Can Cook growing up! One of the first TV chefs and he was SO funny!
I was expecting a LoveHoney sponsorship…
I remember enjoying Yan's knife skills. I can't handle a knife at that level, but i agree with how soothing it is to listen to.
I got that Rushhour flash back I am you and he is me
THIS IS THE BEST!!! I LOVE MARTIN YAN <3 <3 <3 !!!!
I watched Yan religiously.
I LOVED WATCHING HIM GROWING UP  CUT IT UP, CUT IT UP 1,2,3 DONE! GARLIC CLEAVER WHACK!  THANK YOU UNCLE ROGER!
He's crazy famous in Vietnam back then with his Yan Can Cook show. I thought his name is Yan Can Cook for a long time
I recently went to a Jamie Oliver pizzeria. It was surprisingly good! Uncle roger, you gotta try it
PBS had the best cooking shows in the 80s
why are your pants down while watching cooking videos?? Me: don't worry about it 😂😂
My mom showed me Yan Can Cook when I was a child in the 00's. I have his book and it's been indispensable in my journey learning Chinese cooking.
How about an Uncle Roger review of the Mongolian Beef recipie from the "Made With Lau" YouTube channel?
nice to know what uncle Rodger was based off of
I have to say it's a nice change of pace to get that kind of positivity and good vibes from Uncle Roger. Hope the credit score bounces back soon!
1980’s uncle roger ur still young boy?? I thought u will say u were still a sp*rm swimming around that time.
Martin yan was the reason why I picked up a knife to chop food.
Not uncle. Grandfather Yan. Master Yan. Pure legend Yan. Back when there where only 3 channels unless you where rich. I watched every episode.
Dear Uncle Roger, i am your huge fan   from Taiwan, a real country. Haha. I learn a lot from you. Please come to Taiwan. Thank you. MSG , Fuiyoh!!
Peking Duck is wildly overrated
Deeply disappointed they didn’t do a duck fried rice with the remaining meat
Wow three hours and already this many comments..... here i thought i might be one of the first 500 or so comments but nope.... like my dreams of jamie oliver joining Uncle Roger for a team cook off against rachel ray and Gordon Ramsay.... it would be super cool if it ever happened, but ill prolly never be lucky enough for that to happen
Yan can cook was amazing back in the day. I think he could still show a lot of TV chefs how to cook.
Beef rendang from malaysia??? Lol... malingshit
8 million subscribers means a BIG pay rise for uncle Roger
Yan is clearly someone who has inspired Uncle Roger to be what he is. Nice to see his rolemodel!
YAN CAN COOK! Fuiyoh!! 😊 Love you, uncle Roger (and Nigel too!) I just found you on YouTube a couple days ago and I don’t know how I missed you all these years. Your food knowledge is impeccable and you’re so entertaining. Thank you for keeping me company. ❤  I used to watch YAN as a little boy! Oh, the nostalgia— the OG for sure.
Almost 30 now, and I remember being just a child watch Yan Can Cook. Tried my best to make something, but I was like 8...or something like that. He was pretty much my inspiration to start cooking. Not professionally, but just food that taste good. Have now switched over to smoking, but still love to throw the wok on a burner and make something.
Thank you for introducing us god tier chef
I love how I actually was watching Martin Yan videos few weeks ago, just back to back, and I really remember this episode.  Good Ol PBS played this too !
I wanna ask does making chicken fried rice with fried chicken deserve a hiyaa?
Second favorite video after Food War ❤❤❤ Great Job Uncle Roger
💀 lmao unc out here building that score like a champ 😂
I loved Martin Yan! He inspired me so much. Then came Simply Ming. Also the Frugal Gourmet, Jeff Smith, lived in Seattle and cooked some Asian food. He was great, but turned out to be a pedophile.  In the 80s, it was tough to find even red peppers in the US. It was green or nothing.  Martin Yan won a lifetime James Beard award... he's also still cooking. This was two months ago on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJCeZbBIa60
Uncle Roger, you must check out Wok with Yan from Vancouver British Columbia, you're gonna love his humour.
"Don't just sit there and stare at the beef" you can see the inspiration on Uncle Roger <3
That one piece opinion though..haha
8:10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I remember watching Wok with Yan. You should do his show. His jokes are cheesy. All I really remember is that his aprons had a different “wok” joke on them.
I seem asin when the 😢 msg😢🎉 meat up wh rice😂❤
You made me buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker, i hope you're happy!
Jejeje ur exwife joke jajaja
It’s uncle Roger vs Grandpa Roger
You should collab with Chef Yan!
I remember Wok With Yan back in the late 70's early 80's great stuff, funny and informative and always entertaining! Yan is a true legend and it would be absolutely FUIYOH!!! if you were able to do a video with him!
bro why you so sweaty bro
Hey uncle roger can you also review Ninong ry from the philippines.
Jamie Oliver is just the modern Martin Yan. Yeeeah!
Uncle Roger finally got the right uncle to review
Free Taiwan ‼️ Free Palestine ‼️
Yan is the Man!
Not sure if it’s been said already but Yan Can Cook originated in Canada. It was rebroadcasted in the US.
I had such a crush on Martin Yan!
I thought that uncle roger would say: if Yan can cook so can you, except for Jamie Oliver
classic food shows    i remember watching yan can cook as a kid
I loved watching Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan as a kid, it's what started my fascination with cooking and led me into a culinary career that has spanned decades. Love Uncle Yan, much respect to him.
I am pretty sure uncle CCP are watching uncle Roger on every clips from now😂
Yan can cook was my favorite show ever was so scared to see nigel come at him, but how could he not love yan too?!! 😂
Yan Can Cook❤Sooo much childhood memories ❤
peking duck taquitos...pancake my a$$....thats a tortilla.
Awesome video, despite the lack of "Sorry children." moment.
I don’t believe Genghis was very picky with his women he bore many children by way of r*pe if my sources weren’t fraudulent 👎🏻
If yan can cook so can you!
Uncle Roger never forget to roast his ex wife in every video
😂😂😂
I haven't thought about this show in a long time. Good memories.
Mongolian Beef should be spicy, P.F. Chang terrible
Please review authentic Caesar Salad
For me, growing up, it was Ken Hom's Chinese cooking show that got me into Asian food
Used to LOVE watching "Yan Can Cook." Peking Duck is awesome when done properly! Another duck dish that you don't see much anymore, and if you do, it's not made the way they did it in the 70's and 80's is Pressed Duck.
Chinese chef use Japanese Nakiri  on Peking Duck? Haiyaa!
My mom watched this guy which mean I watched him too. Totally forgotten in my brain! The minute I saw him, I knew the catchphrase. My mom (white and Midwestern USA) used her wok all the time. Continues to today. I feel my culinary exposure is better for it! I grew up eating a lot of Yan’s dishes because my mom watched him on PBS. I just realized how much I am grateful for him!! I watched East Meets West when I got a little older. Another good show.
As a Mongolian I heard my ancestors crying when uncle roger say something about Chinggis Khan
quick who knows Morse code what did his cleaver just say 😂
Uncle Roger is correct. Inflation is booshit.
if you need a days notice could you not use data on how often people order the cut corner version and then make batches of it the day before trying to predict demand? if you have a deficit then say it’s limited stock - if you have an excess then give the staff something that sounds fancy as a treat
Loved watching his show as a kid.
Don't just stare at it. 🤣🤣
Uncle Roger in a good mood today 😊 !
I loved watching this with my dad when I was little.
jamie oliver reverting to child labour now 🤣.  i watched his Mediterranean show... haiyaa
I loved his show so much - thanks for this awesome tribute. I remember this episode about the duck - iconic. 🙌
Social credit -100
In California he was shown on PBS. He broke barriers
Why so sweaty? hiyaaaaa
I loved how he took us to the market with him in some videos. First grocery hauls haha.
I need that music on loop in my life!
I did not realize that Uncle Roger was so old.
Is it the same yan with Canadian show « Cook with Yan » also from the 80’s ish?
@mrnigelng... if you want the "real" OG, it's Stephen Yan on the show "Wok with Yan".  This pre-dates Yan Can Cook.  However, the cooking technique is not very... authentic.  But the show is amazingly fun 😂
I watched this show daily. As a child in the 80's. I love this ❤
baking soda makes it tender not corn starch Uncle roger 😅
8:09 😂😂😂😂
Thank you for bringing back Yan Can Cook, Uncle Roger!!!!
Martin Yan is a criminally slept-on chef.
Yan can cook! So can you!
Martin Yan should be more than an Uncle, he should be Grandfather Yan.
Yellow people food eat oils from sewers and dogs foooyoooo
I watch that show back in the day
i find it great that after you got canceld you make the best out of it, and that it got a thing that people want to show you now more their country^^
Great throwback. I loved Yan Can Cook.
This was so wholesome!! Someday Uncle Roger should react to the female Jamie Oliver--Sandra Lee's Semi-homemade!
proposal: Uncle Roger has to cook everything he criticizes to prove he isn't full of bullshit.
0:34 Emotional damage, I guess (maybe)
80's white people😂. You're so sweet uncle roger.🤣
Haha it's the blooper towel throw that got me.
Taiwan is a real country. Leave politics out of your videos or create a separate category so viewers  know in advance whether you will be discussing food or nonsense.
I'd watch this show with my dad.
I thought Uncle Roger was in shitty Airbnb….lol
Bruh, we enjoy long videos.😂
I loved watching Uncle Yan on my local PBS station. There is something about him and the era that is so Heartwarming and innocent.
Well you will love this sound too Uncle Roger (fron 1:40 min on) :)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isx4jc9kyEI
He was always a part of my childhood on Saturday afternoons! Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
OMG! Used to love Yan can cook!
The Asian food market by my house, sells Peking duck for $35 for a whole duck. They literally just give you the whole dock.
This video was bulked filmed
Uncle Roger can you review Wok With Yan also an 80's cooking show :)
After watching your videos, I am going to buy and use msh
Learning from the grand uncle today i see 🎉🎉
Uncle Roger got Wok Bonner for Uncle Yan!!
I used to love Yan Can Cook.  He inspired my mom’s friend to do her own Asian cooking series.
Waited two weeks for this review Uncle Roger. Where have you been? It didn’t disappoint. Thank you, or should I say, “FUIYOH”!
Wok with yan also 😂
Yan's a legend!
I loved watching Uncle Martin Yan on tv. I got to meet him at an event in Pasadena, California, and he autographed his cooking book and gave it to me. He is so sweet and awesome. His twin sons were so adorable.
I watched Yan Can Cook on PBS when I was a kid. I was gifted a Martin Yan branded cleaver  25 years ago (excellent cleaver, I use that thing daily). And now Uncle Roger showcases him.  It all comes full circle.
Legendary Chinese chef 👨‍🍳
Yan can cook, was the best show.
Grateful to PBS for letting me see Yan Can Cook in childhood 😍 him and Bob Ross... good times, good times
I like your good morning towel uncle roger. haha
Oh my god, I've known him since I was little boy.😭❤😭❤ I'm From Vietnam 🇻🇳
Martin Yan is a legend. I'd watch his old show over most of Food Network's content any time.
As a child of the 80s I have great memories of Yan. Loved watching his show.
I love uncle Yan. He inspired me to learn how to cook.
OMG UNCLE ROGER USE MADE WITH LAU IN HIS VIDEO PLS DO A REVIEW ON UNCLE LAU!
When I was 7 my grandma gave me his cookbook and a wok!  I used to watch him all the time when she babysat us.  Martin Yan and my grandma are the reason I love food and despite being a white girl ended up working in restaurants in Japan
Asian Julia Child? Haiyaaah
笑死了哈哈哈
I think everyone should be inspired to be like Martin Yan. FUIYOH!!!
I'm so happy to see you reacting to Martin Yan! I use to watch this with my dad all the time
The 80s was before my time, but I'd love to see more of Yan can Cook. Thanks for showing something I might not have seen otherwise, Uncle Roger!
My mother texted me at the same time he got a notification.
3:38 Based on genetic evidence Gengis Khan had 0 standards for his women and his pull out game was so bad he conquered half the globe
one of my favorites
I miss Wok with Yan and Yan Can Cook!! This man was always great to watch.
Yan was the commencement speaker at my college graduation. I didnt cook back then and had no idea who he was. Now i realize  we were in the presence of a master
I remember watching Yan Can Cook on TV in the 90s when I lived in the Bay Area. Some say that his accent is for entertainment, like Uncle Roger’s
Martin Yan is the legend of Chinese cooking. Period.
Jamie's not just a bad "chef," he also pulled strings to make sure his son got a show, and now the son is being called a "nepo baby" online. So he's a bad father too.
I grew up watching these shows on PBS with my grandma.
I always knew Uncle Martin would make it here! Love you Uncle Roger
YAN CAN COOK was my favorite show during childhood!!!!  As a teenager than young adult, I learned all my asian dishes from Uncle Yan!!!   I wish those old episodes were on some cable channel today so that I get to relive my favorite cooking show of all time.
I was lucky enough to meet and interview Mr. Yan back in the 2000s.  He's a friend's Uncle (really) and he was gracious enough to let us bother him for a couple of hours.  Mr. Yan was an incredible guy - nice, knowledgeable, and a force of nature.  I was really impressed at his breadth of knowledge - from production, to business, to cooking.  One of the highlights of my career.
I bought his rice cooker!
I remember watching Yan Can Cook with my grandma back in the day when I was a little kid. Who knows? Maybe one day my grandchild and I will watch Uncle Roger.
Out of any episode you chose of Yan’s, you chose the first episode I ever saw as a kid!   Instead of one entertainer in one video, we get TWO! Uncle Roger AND Mr. Yan!
Uncle roger needs air conditioning. He is sweating buckets.
Uncle Roger I'm telling you Twice's Tzuyu is going to be very disappointed with you 😂
Awesome is all I can say..
Haiyaaaaaaa the code for MSG is flavor enhancer E621, the normies are gonna freak out if they google that 😔😔😔
Loved Yan Can Cook.
Good show I believe he started out on the local cable 10 tv channel in Toronto.  Wok with Yan was another great show of the day. Featuring Stephen Yan out of Vancouver
3:10 youre 😩
Yan Can Cook rules
1:15 100000000000000+++++
Uncle Yan has a tiktok
Uncle roger, nephew here just want to thank you and I love you.
Jamie Oliver's son got his own cooking show, that's typical nepotism 😂
Uncle roger is hero for asians❤
എനിക്ക് ഉണ്ക്ലെ രോഗേരിൻ്റെ വീഡിയോസ് വലേരെ ഇഷ്ടമാൻ
T H A N K S   F O R    INTRODUCING
I forgot about Yan, I watched this as a kid.  Great call back Uncle Roger!
Wow I used to watch his show when I was a kid. Everyday. Lol great personality
Some kids wanna be a doctor, others astronaut.  But uncle Roger wants to be a millionaire.  I respect that
This is so crazy…my mom was literally talking about Yan and his show, Yan Can Cook…he has a restaurant in the Vancouver area called Yan’s Garden…this is so cool lol
"Mongolian" BBQ buffet was actually invented in Taiwan, "Mongolian beef" I think is a derivative of it before they brought "Mongolian BBQ" to the states.
I watched martin yan. Didn't realize how clean his technique was.
Growing up in the UK, I thought Martin Yan was the only genuine chef on TV. His cleaver skills were top notch.
Mr Yam is the OG operator!
You should look for Wok with Yan videos with Stephen Yan. A Canadian cooking show from the same period.
Dang, I haven't thought about Yan Can Cook for years. Miss that show.
I'm liking this new direction of commenting on Asian TV chef legends! Plans for a video on Ken Hom?
og fr
Once I saw this video I thought of chef wan bc they were talking abt Martin yan saying if yan can cook chef wan be like “one can cook too”I know bc I’m a rly big fan of uncle roger👌 🍳+🍚
My favorite chef of all time.  Grew up with him, I love when he repeats his lines.
Ah, now it's easy to see on what Nigel is basing his Uncle Roger character, just a more spiced up and lot more mean version. Good to know.
the series first aired in Canada in the 70s (yes I'm old and Canadian lol)
Uncle Roger you forgot to give sir Yan his uncle titel 🤧👍
4:18 Ayo!📸💀
Wok with yan was my favorite show.
Was that John Woo carving the Peking Duck?
Yan can cook…what a classic cooking show in my children time
One of my favorite cooking shows!
Yan Can Cook  first aired in Calgary, Alberta, 🇨🇦 (CFAC-TV) in 1978. It was then shown on PBS stations in the US  Fuiyoh!!!
"If Yan can cook, so can you" is more like his slogan rather than just a catch phrase
DAMMIT NIGEL!  You owe me a new MONITOR!  That 'AH! My wife!' cry resulted in my coffee meeting my monitor at high velocity!  🙂
Taiwan Is more a real country  than uncle Roger's accents.  If you don't believe me ask uncle Nigel
I google searched Hoisin sauce E621.  I'm into some new fetishes now, and somehow I'm a furry.  I think i got lost somewhere.
Uncle Rogers leg stayed on the chair the entire time except for the photo when you jumped.
China💞Rescued an Abandoned Child call Roger, raised it and made it a full-fledged member of the family.😂😂😂
Uncle Yan - the OG djent drummer
Grew up on Yan can cook. He just had a nice friendly demeanor about him. The dishes he cooked looked so good. He made chopping look so easy lol. Miss watching his show.
"Yan  Can Cook" was a staple on public television where I grew up. Between Martin Yan and Justin Wilson, I was a young boy of culinary culture 😂😂
The King Heung Restaurant mentioned is unfortunately now defunct
I use to watch this dude when i was a kid. No cartoons on, but yan made me laugh.
always love the Taiwan joke
Yan can cook and Wok with Yan were the reasons i bought my wok almost fifty years ago 🙂
12:35 *turns into Goose*
How about Wok With Yan. The host is Stephen Yan. Filipino kids grew up with this cooking show in the 80's.
Uncle that chop is actually Morse Code for Fuyoh …😂❤
I loved Yan Can Cook! It was my favourite show when I was 3 or 4.
If I was at that restaurant, I would ask them for the rest of the duck. I paid for the duck and I'm getting the whole duck 😂
Cleaver chopping ASMR 10 hour compilation on loop
Yan’s video quality is not too good. But his food and cooking skills are superb! I guess better than many ‘chefs’ nowadays.
Holy moley!  I remember watching Yan Can Cook on public broadcasting as a kid in the 80s.  Absolute legend.
watching cooking, uncle roger getting hot under the table..... er collar....  sorry children.
12:35 bro sounds like a bird☠️☠️
I remember him always showing off his chipping skills.  Good times!
Power move for Jamie Olivers son- invite uncle roger onto said cooking show to make fried rice. Specifically state "my dads fried rice sucks and ive always wanted to know how to make it correctly"
love from bangladesh uncle roger you are my most fav asian man fuiyohhhhhhhhhhh
Marinading meat overnight is not good for asean. But in america it is ok. Mb not in florida.
I love One Piece. 😂 The new one is pretty good too. I've watched it for years.
OG is right, Martin Yan was very entertaining and  funny. He was a big hit back then.
Adore Martin yan to this day. Excellant knife skills!
Martin Yan is definitely a proper OG.
Uncle Roger out here burying the lead: there’s now 2 generations of Olivers to get material from—he will never run out of material😮😆
Watched him all the time back in the day, and had the great pleasure of meeting him once at a home & garden show where he was a featured presenter. Absolutely a gem of a human.
This activated my nostalgia… I never saw this show but I remember going to Chinese restaurants in Japan as a little kid and having Peking duck there
I am a white dude that grew up in vermont in the 80's I wanted to be yan as well
I use to love that show when I was a kid.
8:09 HAHAHA... Love the part that Uncle Roger got shocked with that pic🤣🤣🤣
In case some of you might not know, the "hoi sin sauce" means seafood sauce
In Canada, we had 'Wok with Yan', Stephen Yan used humour in his cooking show, especially Wok puns. His cooking program was my favourite, I looked forward to watching it everyday.  When he retired, the TV stations replaced Stephen Yan's show with the younger Martin Yan's 'Yan Can Cook'.  I watched a few episodes of 'Yan Can Cook', but it just wasn't the same.
Say Formosa, uncle Rodger
We had Wok with Yan in our corner of the world.
I loved Yan! But truth be told, as great as he was, he was no Uncle Roger.😊
I think this is the first time Uncle Roger has ever completely approved of a dish except for maybe chef Wang. It's only fitting it be a video of Martin Yan.
If there's an Internet phrase that describes Martin Yan, it is "Let the man cook."
Duck burrito interesting
Yan can cook 😊🤩
Loved Yan Can Cook as a kid. Then as an adult I went to the mall and recognized his voice - he was giving demonstrations. It all smelled like the best food you could ever eat.
if uncle roger didn't get cancelled in china, maybe he can get the collab with chef wang gang  but, he needed that joke so bad on that tour
beside all that social credit stuff, Mongolian Beef is actually from The real country of Taiwan.  Intresting thing is that it's alledgely invented by a comedian 吳兆南. https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%92%99%E5%8F%A4%E7%83%A4%E8%82%89
Martin Yan: "If Yan can cook, so can you". Me: "Unless you are Jamie Oliver."
I remember watching him, also Steven Yan in Wok with Yan. He always had corny sayings on his apron and Miami Vice jackets on that he took off before changing into his apron.
I wok up confused, thought this was Stephen Yan from Wok with Yan, but he wasnt wearing Wok pun apron.
Love Uncle Yan, a real childhood hero on PBS. A collab would be amazing and I'd put it on repeat for a week!
I used to watch his show on PBS when I was little. Imagine an 8 year old white kid from the deep south asking their mom for Chinese sausage and a wok from the international market.😆
Watch out Uncle Roger, I could hear Aunty Esther getting wet watching these cutting skills. 4:04
Hoisin sauce with peking duck???? Aiyaaaa my ancestors are crying
2:50 ''including taiwan'' make my tummy hurt 🤣😂
UNCLE!!!!   When you travel to Chicago, Il. USA, go to Sun Wah on the north side for an amazing duck meal sliced at your table. Then they use the rest of the duck for a noodle or rice dish.  VERRRY affordable.  BUT, it is not on the menu, but everyone knows to order the meal
Years ago, I got a Chinese cleaver and it quickly became my go-to kitchen knife.  I just felt "legit" using that knife, it's fantastic, but now I realize that I must have fallen in love with it because I grew up watching Chef Yan.
I thought we could call western "chinese" food ABCFood, but that was before I discovered that there's a Hong-Kong specific Chinatown in Toronto, and they do things a little differently.
I love this because I grew up with Martin Yan and we ate amazing Chinese food as a result 😊
This could probably be the only video where uncle roger doesn't use the word "HAIYA" 😂
I’m a white woman. I used to love him wher I was younger. I went to a bookstore to have him autograph his cookbook. I still love Asian men.  His chopping skills took my breath away.
Uncle Roger sounded like a raven in those bloopers 😂
In Canada, we had a great cooking show with Stephen Yan called Wok With Yan.  I would watch it after school each day in the 70’s and 80’s.
As a Taiwanese… haiyaaa 😂
As a Canadian, and lover of all his shows, I wanna point out that he's one of us! Big part of a lot of our childhoods too!
I used MSG in an English restaurant in the early 70’s Uncle Roger.
I am gonna pecking my bag and go to hongkong
If Yan can cook, so can yooouu!!!! 😚🙏😄
I grew up in the 70's and before Martin Yan started "Yan can Cook" , there was "Wok with Yan" with Stephen Yan.  They are not related but Martin Yan worked for Stephen Yan before starting his own show.
Cornstarch doesn’t soften beef, it makes it silky. Chinese restaurants add baking soda to beef to tenderise the beef.
I still watch Yan can Cook on youtube. So happy Uncle Roger Loves him too
I remember him as a kid. If I watched him now, I would have loved to learn to cook lol. He's the encouraging dad in the kitchen I never had 😂
My best local Chinese makes a certain amount of Peking duck every day. If you come to late you can't have any. But you go early enough you can get it
How come you don't put msg on plain white rice
I loved watching Yan when I was growing up. He is an amazing cook. He is very funny as well.
Chef Yan was aired on PBS in my area. Watched him on Saturday when I could.
cancelation in progress ...... xDD i luv you uncle roger
Man it would be so awesome if Nigel could make a video with Martin Yan, Id love to see that
If Yan can cook, so can you! Zai Jian!" Love this guy
How much time uncle Roger gonna roast Taiwan?  Uncle Roger - Yes 😁 Credit +++
I used to watch his show all during the 90s on PBS 🥲
If we got a Martin Yan and Uncle Roger collab, I would lose my goddamn mind and probably would be able to die happy
Martin Yan is the O.G. we even bought his rice cooker.
The social credit score got me... HAHAAHAH
Wah all these memories come back
Ken Hom is the GOAT
Uncle Roger you have to meet Martin Yan the famous chef
I'd get my Ginger in there by Eating with Stir Fried Ginger Broccoli and no noodles.
Dude, growing up watching Yan he was the best. That was great to see. Great video brother!
holy shit haven't see this guy in years really hope you can make a video with him
When I was in high school and lived nearby, I would go home for lunch and watch this man cook. It inspired me to learn to cook and enjoy it.
If Yan can cook, so can you,except Jamie Oliver.
My mom would watch Yan along with me, she loved Chinese food.   He randomly pops up on TIktok and treats it like a Twitch type account.    Also, love the Made with Lau shout out, definitely Uncle Lau needs a review too.
“80s white people”.
Perhaps my favorite PBS chef from back then. He was a refreshing contrast to Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, the Frugal Gourmet, and others. Martin Yan, definitely ahead of his time for his presentation of cooking.
For the algorithm
I remember Yan Can Cook, hope he is well. World famous Mongolian John Wayne Mandarin duck taco
I loved watching 'Yan Can Cook' as a kid. Martin has a great sense of humor, and an excellent cook.
I am Alpharius.
Just here to give respect to Chef Yan.
Yan can cook and the Louisiana Chef, my 2 favorite men from the 80s 😂 I was 8 with a crush on both - I was either a weird kid or had good standards early on …nothing like a man that can cook!
Damn , uncle roger and Martin saying "duck" word is real satisfying
In his defense, someone wanted Mongolian Beef marketed to the US population as a true Chinese dish, and spread that story, and Yan (or nearly anyone) did not have the internet, so he could not debunk it.
Grew up with Yan, Julia, and Jacques. 😅 no cable, just wliw and pbs. Good times.
I LOVE LOVE ❤Martin Yan! My brother and I would watch his show right after Julia Child’s. Being Gen X kids, we taught ourselves how to cook by watching these shows dutifully. I learned how to make fried rice from him.  I love Martin Yan 🥰🥰🥰🥰👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Taiwanese left the chat...
I grew up on Yan can cook, too. I also bought a rice cooker because of Uncle Roger.
The social credit score joke is sending me  tuh heellll
Uncle Yen is an opposite of your ex-wife
10:08 - Am I the only one that thinks that looks like a taco with flour tortilla?
The crows outside my apartment sound like 12:35 😂
Loved this show as a kid
@9:20 Uncle Roger channeling some Mr. Rogers energy right there. Respect.
YES!!! These are the dudes that taught me how to cook! Yan can cook, East Meets West, the Cajun southern guy. OGs in the cooking show world
It's very good you showed yang can cook his knife skills are second to none.
Review one piece live action❤
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan.  I learned how to cook by watching them.
I enjoyed watching him as a kid.
Bringing back memories
Sundays would be Yan Can Cook, The Frugal Gourmet, The Cajun Chef and maybe some Bob Ross. Good times
you could tell that Peking Duck was one of his favourites.
Them white glubbs must have looked like your underpant sweat wipe Unkie wodger after  serving that sticky Peking
Nice!  Have to review the other Yan next!
Yan Can Cook was my favourite cooking show in Australia as a child. Always entertaining. Thanks Uncle Roger.  To UR fans....we need to put some money together and buy UR some aircon. This is getting crazy!!
We can all appreciate an impressive chopper.
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Up2qlydgVzc is a short dealing with the translations of "Haiya!" & "Fuiyou!" I always think of Haiya meaning Oh no! and Fuiyou meaning "Oh yeah!"
More Martin Yan! Icon that doesn't get nearly the love he deserves, also pretty cool to see your reverence for him on display. Good video Nigel!
surprised you didn't mention the sizzling by commenting: "This is the sizzling that my ancestors want to hear"
Uncle Roger (Nigel), you need to go to San Francisco and make a bunch of cooking videos with Martin Yan. That would be super awesome. Also, if you two could enlist the Triads to help clean up San Francisco and N California of all the whackos destroying the place we would be forever grateful
Lol I already know all of this.
OMG...HIV and MSG...killed me
Picking man = Uncle Roger's ex wife 🤣🤣
Yoooo! Im 41 and used to watch Yan can cook all the time and loved it... I'll always remember "if Yan can cook, so can you!"... good times
This is a crime. Changing location with a VPN to pay less is a fraud and you can end in jail, best case paying a sue
"ill watch one piece anime before the netflix one."  37 seasons.  JFC.
I would slice off a couple of fingertips if I chopped like that!🤣
3:47 "nice chopping", he's not chopping, he's sending a morse message to the PCC in China : "infiltration.among.white.people.done.stop.awaiting.instructions.stop"
Omg Martin Yan is a KING.
Stare fry!!! 😂
I used to watch Martin Yan as a kid too! He was very entertaining
Your voice is higher pitch than all the other ABC lol.
martin yan the legend... best tv cook host ever :D
You need to do more of this series yan can cook is the best show
Uncle Roger is such an amazing person and also a menace to countries 😂
Yan can Cook originated in Calgary, AB, CANADA in 1978
I know its a joke, but taiwan is a country
I've waited so long for this day, when the uncle pays homage to the king.   "And remember, if Yan can cook, so can you!  Zai jian"
I wish Uncle Roger also reviews Wok With Yan videos.
Deep fry the rest of the duck. It's like meat candy
That ad transition was good 😂
Martin Yan visited the cooking program at Contra Costa Community College in 1984 when I was studying there. We were a bunch of young idiots but, though he was visibly exhausted, he was incredibly gracious. Don't remember what he demonstrated but I remember immediately going to buy a Chinese cleaver and using only that for several months because his knife skills.
I remember watching Chef Yan's show in the 70s, "Wok with Yan." He's on par with Bob Ross, in my opinion. Thanks for a lovely and funny video!
I have always loved watching Martin Yan
Yan and Justine the Cajun cook were the best when i was a kid.
I absolutely LOVED Yan Can Cook! one of my favorite TV shows of all time! even as a young boy.
4:20  The way he chops is as a legend as his motto. OMG, the sound from that, the first generation of ASMR
Love it when uncle roger said Taiwan is a real country OMG
As a Canadian I grew up with Stephen Yan's Wok With Yan. I'd love to see Uncle Roger review him (and his apron).
After seeing this video , l can confirm that Martin is father of Uncle Roger .
1 hour gang 👇👇👇👇
Grew up watching Yan cook and his chopping was my favourite lol now that I’m older I appreciate the cooking process👌
Uncle Roger, a correction: Disney+ just went up to $13.99/m, during a writer's strike.... Otherwise, excellent episode.
hell yeah I used to watch this guy, the frugal gourmet, and Juliet child back in the '80s when I was a little kid...😆... Good stuff 👍👏
If Yan can, you can! Zai jian!
Yan can cook was amazing I grew up watching that guy as a kid. I loved when he'd use two cleavers at once and call it his Chinese food processor.
You veiled political humour is hilarious😂
Nobody gonna talk about that piece of handkerchief/ towel???
Yan Can Cook, Julia Childs and Justin Wilson were my favorites as a child. I would prefer them over Sesame Street and The Electric Company. I learned a lot from them and others although my favorite was Martin Yans method of cutting green peppers by laying on their side and rolling it while cutting in one smooth motion destemming and deseeding. My knife skills are owed to these great teachers...
Certified Gold!!!!!
Halloooo
Uncle roger says inflamation is boolsheet and then uses apple laptop 😭
Even here in the Philippines, we grew up with Martin Yan! Love his show! Hope you can collab with him soon! He needs to be relevant again!
Jump to the late 90s and review some Ming Tsai.
First thing I remember learning from uncle Yan is "Hot wok,  cold oil, food no stick". My mom freaked when her 12 yr old white son wanted a wok.
I watched the other Yan ie Wok With Yan in the 80s.
If uncle Roger likes the sound of cleaver chopping so much he would love living somewhere there are woodpeckers! 🐦
i remember watching Uncle Yan with my mom all the time. I miss that
Yan the OG of cooking!
i still remember watching him and chef  wan with my mom... that small boy who feel in love too cooking man i miss the old days..still chasing my dreams tho HHAHAHAHA
Wok with Yan was a Chinese cuisine cooking show starring Stephen Yan.
Yan was the man
I have been watching Yan for as long as I can remember.
This must be the first Uncle Roger video without a "Sorry Children" in it
Is he uncle roger's father? Their accent and jokes looks the same
This show was so cool! 🥹 Thanks for the reminder!
Yan has rhythm even in his chopping, that's how he's so entertaining
IF YAN CAN COOK, SO CAN YOU!
This was insanely nostalgic. My dad and I would watch Yan together all the time and we always talk about him and use his tips when we cook Asian foods to this day!
Umm, why did this dish named "Mongolian Beef" which is not came from Mongolia? (Fun fact: Mongols are mostly intolerant to spicy foods.) When you want to review Mongolian dishes, watch Artger.
My Italian grandmother used to LOVE Yan Can Cook, she loved to see people cook food so different from her own and watching this take me back.
I still remember one Yan episode where he was cooking something Korean and it had an enormous amount of garlic. "Use lots of garlic in Korean food. Koreans are an especially stinky people". LOL. I don't think he got in trouble. It was the 80's. He'd be cancelled today. And, when I lived in Beijing in the 70's there was no Peking Duck. Lots of duck but it was all named by its cooking style, like Crispy Duck, etc.
Celebrity chef kids getting a cooking show is such gross nepotism
This brought me such good memories of watching yan can cook with my dad as a little girl 😊
Martin Yan, the king of uncles. Please bring him to your channel.
Growing up in the 80s, Yen Can Cook was on public access tv. I watched a few hours of him every weekend. He even taught me how to use chopsticks, which I prefer to use now days. ❤
My man chopped 20 times and only cut 6 slices 😂 He’s showing off 😅
12:16 uncle roger’s normal voice is so hot i cant😭😭😭😭😭
I watched him all the time! Had the biggest crush on him! His wife is beautiful!!!
That guy is the OG
Love Martin Yan! "Yan Can Cook" was one of the first cooking shows I started watching as a child, and I've been hooked ever since.
grew up watching this show on PBS in the 80s (edit) got it mixed up with Wok With Yan w/ Stephen Yan  a CBC chinese cooking show
and THEN!!
Yan can cook was my moms favorite show, we were poor, and she checked his book out 5 times in a row from the library, until she hand copied every recipe. I still remember him showing how to make bacon out of thinly sliced tofu and liquid smoke. TLT was a family favorite for years. We weren't vegetarian, just poor. She watched his show religiously. Have to add, Corn starch & MSG gives you a Foodgasm, it's a better thing.
Let's start a gofundme to buy an aircon for Uncle roger! HAIYAAA so many months already still no aircon. 😮‍💨
If you've never seen Yan debone a chicken it's unbelievable. He's so fast
If only I had a cleaver! BTW Taiwan IS a country as is Ukraine 🇦🇺💙💛✌ 🇺🇦
😅😅
Here comes this month's cancellation
Emotional Damage? (about Ex-Wife)
8:10 had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
That japanese p*rn joke was wild 😂😂😂
I totally forgot about this show. My mom used to watch him a lot
I remember watching yan can cook with my mom when I was like 5 or 6. He’s definitely the OG
We all know Taiwan is not really country always part Of China same with Hong Kong also part of China 😊
I use to LOVE watching Yang can cook‼️💯💯 he's awesome ❤❤
Yan can cook was one of my favorite shows growing up since we didn't have cable. My brother and I learned a lot from him, and he gave me passion and confidence for cooking when I was young. Such a positive role model.
Chop Chop chop chop! Look how easy
Uncle roger should find any white people trying to do this dish, it might be hilarious 😂
Taiwan viewer here!
Uncle Yan is one of my cooking heroes and started my love affair with Asian cuisine
this is the guy that got me into cooking
When i was young l LOVED yan can cook show . He was a funny guy and a great chef
I have learnt more about Asian cooking with uncle Roger that in my 4 years cooking school 😅
"Including Taiwan" You're one of the good ones Uncle Rodger.
Black southern boy here! Loved that show!!
10:13 his face experiencing true luv 😂😂
one of my pet peeves is the word "peking duck", like bro, the word came from "beijing roast duck", so just say "beijing duck"
Can Uncle Roger make a video with @junelikethemonth
Martin Yan was one of Julia Child's favorites. She thought he never got the credit he deserved because he was so light-hearted and self-effacing.
let’s travel to the 80s
Only thing we sell today is Mongorian beef. Mongorian beef so good, oh I just "love" it. Oh, herro, Mongorian! [waves to a group of eight Mongolian warriors, sitting at two tables with their food. They all turn their eyes at Tuong] Shh! [whispers] Mongorians are watching. They conquer me last week. Act natural. [speaks loudly again] Oh yeah, Mongorian beef, mmm, so tasty, right? Wow...
Ooohr~ So Uncle Roger used to have eyes problem. Maybe he do operation, eyes better now! If I see Uncle Roger's Ex wife? I run!
they don't allow air conditioners in the UK?
My favourite Chinese chef was always Ken Hom
love Yan can cook lol
i think u will get blacklisted by Mongolia because you say their god (Genghis Khan) 😊
Piquing duck is the best.
Martin Yan's knife skills were always above and beyond all the other chefs on TV at the time. The way he would count along with every slice getting faster and faster. Crazy skills.
Yan Can Cook my late mother's favourite cooking show!  And his accent is real
I forgot about Martin, I used to love watching him. Thank you for blessing us with a new video ❤
Wow, the fact that you came at Taiwan(first time) like that had my mouth OPEN. lol
I like Martin Yan, but he's not even the OG Yan. Look into Cook with Yan for the real OG: Stephen Yan.
Don’t serve the whole duck? Bruh, I’m going to need the the rest if that duck i paid for
OMG his chopping have a really nice rhythm.
Billy Crystal's character would say "Marvelous"... that's what Martin Yan's reference is to.
I loved watched Martin Yan and Ming Tsai cooking on PBS.
Omg When I was young I watched him every chance I got. I had completely forgotten about him until today. But somehow to this day when I stir fry I still say to myself "stir fry not stare fry". What a lasting impression that man made in my life!  Not all heroes wear capes!  Now I realize how much he influenced my cooking up until this very day. Thank you Uncle Yan and also you Uncle Roger
some high level marketing here
Martin Yan's "Marvelous" reference was from Billy something's character on Saturday Night Life in the 80s.
Late stage Gen X here.  80s shows raised this latchkey kid!
1:07 The biggest cap I've ever heard of
There was also 'Wok with Yan' back in the day.  Both were awesome.
I remember Yan from his original show called Wok with Yan that I used to watch in Detroit but it was shown on channel 9 CBC from Windsor Canada across the river.
I wish I watched this as a kid.
My all-time favorite OG AZN chef on TV! Great cleaver techniques, demystified AZN ingredients & recipes and always w/ the warmest Dad humor! No doubt, if Uncle Yan knows you want to work w/ him - he will be open to invite you to his kitchen!    The younger foodie-gen Internet Army, make it so! Let 'Yan Can Cook' know about Uncle Rog's wish of a fun & great cooking collab!
Ah, the Classics!  Yan.     When will Uncle Roger review the "Galloping Gourmet"?  Any Julia Child critique?  I can't wait for Uncle Roger to take on Martha Stewart.
No need to review you already said it in the title O.G. Martin Yan
Uncle Roger never fails to make us laugh
You need to review "wok with Yan" a Canadian cooking show from back in the 80"s. Pure gold
Mr Yan isnt uncle he is sensei
Yan Can Cook! Of course instant "Uncle" status.
Uncle Yan was a childhood hero of mine as well, I used to love watching Yan Can Cook on PBS
as a half Thai half Chinese half English I gotta say all of his vids are valid
Stare Fry vs Stir Fry🤣🤣🤣
Also grew up watching Yan Can Cook. Great stuff. Miss it.
Uncle Yan's chopping sounds like Morse code 😂
I went back and rewatched him chop the bell peppers before uncle roger brought it up 😂
Nostalgia...............😊😊😊😊
I wish I could give you 2,000,000 dollars. I don't watch TV. I only watch Uncle Roger on repeat.
Shout out uncle Roger for shouting out Jamie Olivers son❤️🇿🇦
I always thought baking soda was a natural meat tenderiser in Chinese cooking. Works great for me.
Yan Can Cook was my favorite cooking show growing up
If Yang can cook so can YOU! I used to watch him all the time hahahah
Are there any Asians that aren’t your uncle?
The Mongols were horse people, so it'd be Mongolian horse instead of beef.
This is the real, OG uncle. Nigel Ng is just a stand up comedian doing cosplay 💀
I loved Yan Can Cook when I was a kid. I'm gonna have to go on a nostalgia search now 😊
I so miss wok with yan
Growing up in the 90s, I remember one time my doctor said I might have been sick from the MSG in the Ramen noodle packs, they really didn't like MSG back then.
Loved watching Yan back in the day. One of my favorite old school TV chefs. Another favorite was pasqauli's kitchen express for Italian
That Taiwan joke is wild lmfao I love it.
Love this show, i often mixed up with Stephen Yan's 'wok with Yan'
I almost spit out my coffee💀when he do the 🍳 👀 5:02
OK, here i am,a Taiwanese without using VPN.
The chef that inspire me to use Chinese cleaver for preping ingredience.
I will try your corn starch and MSG tip together with some chopping music tonight 🙃🙃🙃 Your final 10 "Hyaaaaa!!!" scenes throwing your hand towel made my day !!!
Yesterday I made fajitas in a wok. They were perfect.
If Yan can cook, You can cook.
i grew up in the bay.  he was my first and constant cooking show.
Thank you for doing a Martin Yan video. I grew up watching his show on TV.
Yan can cook is to this day still one of my favorite shows...where is our love this button damn it!
lmao the social credit score.
The whole reason i got into cooking was because of martin.i used to watch him when i was 5years old on channel 6 love how he is being metioned my day is made.
Yan has a YouTube channel now too! @ChefMartinYan
He feels like the Bob Ross of cooking
Martin Yan used to come to my school in San Francisco as a guest chef instructor.  Love him!
Chef JP is another great chef...
Wok with Yan
I was raised on "Yan Can Cook" as a kid, watching it after school on PBS... <3
I still remember our whole family watch his show on TV while growing up. The man is my childhood hero.
Uncle Roger said it was simpler times before Jamie Oliver. Wouldnt it be a harder time for you? Uncle Roger wouldnt be so popular without Jamie to make videoes about.
We need a go fund me for Uncle Rogers AC.
I remember watching him on tv.
I wached Yan Can Cook religiously when I was young.  He came on before Bob Ross and the Joy of Painting.  I watched them both back to back every time it was on
Uncle  Roger needs to find a girlfriend. Lol
Can you review  Sri Lanka food pls pls❤❤❤😂😂😂
Good old days
Love Chef Yan!!! He’s my hero too!! I was lucky enough to score a seat at one of his cooking demonstrations in Hong Kong 10 years ago. He made his own version of creamed corn fish fillet, and his cooking was legit. It tasted truly authentic too! He also demonstrated how to butcher a chicken in 30 seconds. Super impressive! I remember having a brief chat with him after and he was as enthusiastic and nice as he was on TV. ❤
Peking duck cost is not inflation. The value of the dollar is about 4 times less than back then. Worth same, haiiiiyaaaaa...
I luv watching Uncle Roger, informative and some humor. I know the accent is fake but I like it, fits the character so well. I got hooked on his videos, he always makes me laugh with his sarcastic commentary, the best and he's so cute! ☺️
Cancel no 5 incoming and it won't be his last xD
Wok with Yan was a good show in the 80’s too
👑🤲☄️
uncle Roger I live in Hong Kong (white boy) and the duck is not 150-200 usd at all
4:38 Cocaine what no wonder his food good
How did he know what Peking Man tasted like? 😮 Sorry children.
I loved watching Yan Can Cook  growing up. But I always thought Yan was his first name.
"Wok with Yan" ❤❤loved that show.
Simple plating is good. no need so fancy, most importantly is the taste. Looks delicious. Ya Hope Mr Martin Yan (Uncle Yan you mentioned in the video)  saw your video and look for you to collaborate.
Hot chilis didn’t even exist in Asia when Genghis Khan was alive
yeah its not from mongolia like Uncle Roger said , i am mongolian myself and never ate something like this.
I remember most vividly his minute noodles.
Haiyaa uncle roger you stoobid, Taiwanese people won't cancel you because joke haiyaa
Thanks for the nostalgia Uncle Roger. I loved watching this show as a kid, haven't heard that catchphrase in years!
8:03 we get to see uncle Roger’s ex-wife
Uncle roger so thrifty, he got no AC
I got to watch Martin Yan debone a whole chicken in under 30 seconds. It was amazing.
Realy wanna see uncle rodger video where jamies son gets better review
I grew up watching Martin Yan, even saw him live once.
LMAO I Iiterally saw an Americas Test Kitchen video on Mongolian beef last night
Hiyahhh
uncle roger come to india, i will pay to watch you :)
uncle roger getting wet in this one
I don't know Uncle Rodger. I grew up watching Martin Yan back in the day too. You critiquing him just seems wrong!! He was and is still one of my favorites!!!!
Good Morning towel 👍🏻
One thumbs up on your increasing social credits😂
He was my favorite after Justin Wilson.  I found out in the past two years JW may not have really been from Louisiana, so Yan Can Cook has moved up one.  Am also cooking my own Chinese food at home when I have energy.  MSG and all.
Fuyioooooo 1 hour
Before "Yan can Cook", there was "Wok with Yan".
Bro, it's time to go to kmart and buy a $20 fan and get an aircon installed. If you can't for strata reasons, just buy a portable one with an exhaust to outside!
I grew up watching and loving Martin Yan; I learned a lot from him. But there was another Yan in Canada that I watched at the same time: Stephen Yan (probably no relation) who also had a great cooking show on CBC. He's the one with all the Wok pun aprons.
I think this is the first time uncle roger didn't put his leg off from the chair 😅
Why uncle Roger keep wiping face from sweat? You can't afford a/c? Why so poor? Why so poor? And yes, FNCK tic toc. I love your channel. Buy A/C👍👍
Man that's a blast from the past I used to love watching Yan can cook as a kid.
uncle roger sweating
I was thinking it needed ginger, and then you said you would add ginger.  Would you recommend finely sliced (toktoktoktoktok, fuiyoh!), or grated via microplane?
in 90, i always watch wok with yan, but not martin yan, its stephen yan from canada
4:17 and some americans and vietnamies will get PTSD from that XD
Uncle roger, you haven't react the OG Yan. He's Wok With Yan! Great chef with lots of comedy that i used to watch on my childhood
Martin Yam at least was a real CHEF
I thought Mongolian beef also called Genghis Khan was something in japan. Or maybe it's just popular there, maybe it's something completely different.
If Yan can cook, so can Jamie Oliver, not!
RELAX THE CHICKEN..!  Nice to see you salute the Original Gangster. Grew up with him. Now you must interview CHAIRMAN KAGA..! 🎉
Man...i watched Yan when ever i could.  Way to brimg it back Uncle. !
Thanks for unlocking old memories of watching Yan Can Cook growing up. I loved that show. It was so entertaining & informative. 🥰
I used to watch Yan Can Cook when visiting my Grandma/Nonna. This brings back memories.
I LOVE Yan Can Cook! It was always sponsored by Kikkomon
In Tokyo, you can find Peking duck for about $40
I used to watch his cooking show all the time when I was a kid!! TBH I watched it more than cartoons!... that also A-team, Air Wolf and Night Rider lol
Actually？ Chef wan come from were？
Before yan can cook was a thing. I remember a cooking show called wok with yan. He throws in something he calls wonder powder to his dishes. Some say it’s cornstarch. But I always thought it was MSG.
If yan can cook, you can too!               Except Jamie Oliver ofc
Martin Yan and Justin Wilson were my must watch when I was a kid. This was a blast from my last.
Martin Yan and Uncle Roger collaboration, please!
I used to love watching Martin Yan on TV as a kid. His food always looks 🔥🔥
I grew up watching Yan Can Cook - when I was in elementary school in the 80s, if I was ever home sick from school this is one of the shows I would always watch. That’s how I learned about corn starch solution.
As a very white kid growing up in very white suburbia Yan Can Cook was a look into a different way to approach food. One of the first things I did once I was on my own was get a wok and find an Asian grocery. Eventually I became a professional chef, not really because of Martin Yan but he certainly helped, and now that I have moved on to a profession that doesn't involve being on my feet all day I still love cooking recreationally and I'm still exploring the cuisines of the world. PBS producing these cooking shows really opened the world to a lot of people.
So big MSG convinced me to buy a 1 pound bag of MSG. It does improve FLAVOUR.
I haven’t thought of Yan Can Cook since 1995. One of the channels used to air reruns after Saturday morning cartoons
I watched yan can cook as a child at my grandmas house because she had no cable tv. His show was great!
Just few seconds into the video, already I can hear Jamie lol
Hahahahaha the Taiwan thing killed me lmao. What a legend. Love this guy’s comedy.
Yan is the OG
where is the gofundme to buy my man uncle roger an AC
I watched yan can cook all the time in the 80s….. WONDER POWDER!!!
I LOVE martin yan - yan can cook was everything to me growing up- he means so much to me even now-i only liked his style of tv cooking cause it made me laugh and easy to understand and remember.  until sept 11 happened - that was the day everyone was forced to watch either the news or cooking channel. I still want to be like Martin Yan. can you do more of his videos?!
That was a great show!!!
Mongols only cooked mutton or horse. FYI
9:52 About hoisin sauce - Chinese Peking duck restaurants usually don’t serve hoisin sauce.  They just use Tianmian sauce (甜麵醬, lit. sweet flour sauce, or tenmenjan as Japanese call it).  I guess they use hoisin sauce because it’s more common in the US and they taste kinda similar.
The combo we didn’t know we needed
I remember watching Yen when I was younger. I always loved his sense of humor!
bro can talk about one topic and suddenly transition to a sponsor 😂😂 the transitions are so smooth
Today I learned that Jamie Oliver has a twelve year old son who has released cooking videos and is getting his own show...
Uncle Roger please buy yourself a fan or portable fan 😂
Mongols never cooked rice or rice noodles. Correct!!!
yes daddy cut that red bell pepper again 😍😍
good lord, this takes me back to the old PBS cooking shows when i was little. maybe it's just the nostalgia, but Martin Yan had more talent, personality, and knowledge than a lot of hosts today.
I grew up with Yan Can Cook!!  I love this, thank you!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This dish is so simply that you can only toss the wok with timing in a lose.
Such great memories with Yan Can Cook. And I like that he, and many early cooking shows at this time, also taught about their Culture and traveled to those locations to see it for oneself 💜
This and Iron Chef were my cooking shows to watch back in the 90's.  In fact, you should try reacting to Iron Chef, Uncle Roger!
Haha used 2 watch this on Singapore TV across the causeway after school It was aired like 2pm and i always rushed home like till 1.55pm or something hahahaha Good times indeed no woke or toxicity life back then
Nice, we had Ken Hom in the UK. The moral of this video is everything good comes out of South East Asia fuyoooiiiii
Omg I love this soooo much! I watched Martin yan growing up, glad he's getting recognized
SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE -10000000 after uncle Roger said this at 2:50 😂😂😂
OMG...miss this show.
Miss him
I adored the Yan can cook show. Watching this transports me back to  my childhood. Then Uncle Roger speaks and crashes me in the present... Haiyaaa
Bhayi mujhe kya main to India se hu.... 💀
I never missed his show.
as mongolian im happy
Martin Yan is Awesome. I watched him when I was a kid in the 80's.
Yesterday I wanna be engineer, Today I wanna be like Uncle Yan FUIYOH!!!
Wow. Major flashbacks. Glad that Yan is getting his due. In an era of primarily "Italian" food chefs on TV, Yan was a welcome antidote to the endless parade of bland pasta dishes. Thank you.
What the fuck is that picture Tito Roger. It almost give me a nightmare.
Us Navajos love Martin Yan! That’s the only celebrity chef we ever seen on TV back in the day! 😂 Fui Yooo!!!
I love Uncle Yan, so, so much.
Is there a title above Uncle? If there is, Martin Yan has it.
Multiple takes of Uncle Roger dramatically throwing a towel >>>>>>>>>>>>>
Uncle Roger almost turned into daft punk around the 7:35 mark
Same Uncle Roger. Same. The 80s were the best time to be a kid
Martin Yan is a legend.
You should collab with Martin yan because gordon Ramsay collaborated with him and he collaborated with you which makes it perfect for you to collab with him
Hoisin sauce. Martin yen MSG alternative
I like the Uncle Roger vibe. But let me tell you folks something. Genghis Khan real pronunciation Chinggis Khaan in Mongolian language is being brought upon a big argument that China which is a majority asian populations is trying to apply the name into themselves rather the man was a Mongolian. If you come to Mongolia you will think why we are so different from so many asian and other asian cultures. not including Buddhism tought. Chinggis Khan is truelly a Mongolian and will be forever. Chinese or Japananese will never stole this name and privilge in a million years.
Chinese Cleaver Chopping ASMR when?
Shout out plz
YAN IS THE GOAT
I used to watch walk with yan on cbc here in Canada he was on in the mornings, loved his show.
I’m going to buy a map of Asia and going to mark down the countries Uncle Roger has covered.
Hahah Taiwan joke 🤣
Martin Yan is the reason I became a Chef.  Watching Yan Can Cook on PBS as a kid.  Man, this brings back memories.
Uncle Yan = Legend
Wait, wait. So Martin Yan is different from the Wok With Yan guy?  What were the odds they’d have TWO chefs named Yan airing on TV in the same era?!?
This guy is like the Bob Ross of cooking
Petition for Uncle Roger to review Middle Eastern (Egyptian, Iranian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Turkish) cuisine:
Yan the man !!!!!
I just cooked chunks of chicken breast in a saute pan and it was the moistest chicken I have ever cooked. Corn starch is no joke
Uncle Roger, please reach out to Uncle Yan and get him on to maybe do a You can cook and so can Uncle Roger!  (Taking credit)...fuyah!!!
Buy an AC Uncle Roger. You have 8M subscribers, you can afford one.
And remember, if Yan can cook, so can you!
You should do a video with uncle Yan. Making the Mongolian Beef.
Nostalgic memories of watching Yan Can Cook on daytime TV when home sick from school.
We always did equal parts oyster and hoisin among the other ingredients for Mongolian
Uncle Roger swaying made my Sunday! So cute haha
Ah good old 80's, when we have such good cooking show, slow b roll documentry about peking duck carving and best of all, Hong Kong was not under CCP rule.
I remember chef wan saying if Yan can cook wan can cook too
Yan can, and indeed does, cook! What an amazing guy and a blast from the past!
reach out to Uncle Martin!  Be great to meet your hero and cook with him.  Get Josh & Guga to join!!
Eheh i remember watching this guy when i was a kid  I'm old 😢
Nice he back in UK
E621 is MSG, but I knew it as something else entirely 🤭
THAT is why Uncle sounds so familiar!!!
我的奶奶很喜欢这个yan的烹饪节目
Martin Yan huh.. Stephen Yan is the real thing!!
8:36 I downloaded the wrong version of ‘The Shining’.
YEAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! I suggested this ages ago! Martin Yan on KCET on the weekends... BIG part of my childhood. Everyone wanted those cleaver skills.
This is the most therapeutic video I’ve seen in around 12 months the 80s music the loading up the pancake. The good old days.
I want more video on yan show
What if Uncle Roger collab with Uncle Martin Yan? It will be epic!
I miss “Yan can cook”
Man, I wish I had a famous dad who could get me a cooking show. I got a dad that left my mom and started a new family.
Another one I used to watch was Steven Yan.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEWFXWtCIw&list=WL&index=82&t=1700s
Oh wow I wanna watch more of Uncle Yan's cooking videos!
Yan Can Cook is AWESOME! I can remember rainy Saturday afternoons watching this & loving it
When I saw this, I truly began to think that my content algorithm can read my mind, because I was literally just thinking recently “man, wouldn’t it be awesome to see Uncle Roger review Martin Yan.”  And I was cooking rice in my Martin Yan Rice Cooker at the time. And when I make rice in it, I always say to myself “if Yan can cook, so can I.”
If Yan can cook, so can you!
Martin Yan got me interested in cooking as a kid. I fucking LOVED Yan Can Cook!!!!
Uncle Roger I'd love for you to review the calming traditional Yunnan videos of @dianxixiaoge ❤ I love to watch the feasts she creates
He’s my favorite growing up, I never could do the shit he did.  I don’t know why his show isn’t on a 24/7 streaming channel like Julia Child or Gordon Ramsay.
0:25 Fun fact: Jamie did still exist at that time, though he was only five, so we didnt have to taste his cooking 💀🔥
I too grew up watching Martin Yan! Most entertaining and enlightening chef on PBS by far!
The real OG is Wok with Yan, only legends will remember...
😊😊😊
I got to enjoy dim sum at Martin Yan’s SF restaurant. 🤤  Was sad to see no reference to actual 🇨🇦 OG TV chef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Yan of “Wok With Yan”
Such a great show, damn he's good. Was adorable watching Uncle Roger fanboy over someone.
dude, you sweating all over the place is a downvote..
If Yan can cook, so can you! Brings me back to my childhood
“Cancellation No. 5”😂
Dang. Uncle Roger almost opened the forbidden backdoor
I still say "if yan can cook,.so can you" every day.
9:34 lets not forget now days ppl want subway suffers gameplay and asmr slime videos going on a 45 second tiktok
I grew up with yan can cook
Yan is a legend! I used to watch him every day!
Taiwan, the only country that stands to China CCP
I hope Uncle roger will have a collab with Chef Yan!
Nigel's sweat rag is a genius prop. So authentic!!!
Master Martin Yan finally, fuiyoh~~
Martin Yan was indeed the OG! remember loving his shows.
National Treasures of America: - Mister Rogers - Mister T - Martin Yan
Equation of the Day: Cornstarch x MSG = Orgasm
I'm 8 years old again. There weren't many cooking shows back in the 80s but Yan was THE man. Anytime he was on, I had to watch.
Uncle Roger has more enemies than North Korea.
Thats the time my dad bought his 1st WOK when this show was on... also  my favorite is General Tso chicken... idk who that is.. but his chicken is awesome! 🤗🥰🤤😋
OMG Martin Yan. I was up on Saturdays watching this every weekend.
10:21 lmfao "北京 my interest" wtf why have I never heard that before lol
I am pretty sure Martin Yan was the inspiration for Gusteau in _Ratatouille_  Great video, Uncle Roger -- I wish I had been able to watch more Yan Can Cook back in the day.
I'm a little too young to have seen his show, but I do own his cookbook. His wontons are so tasty, and I would kill a man to eat the vermicelli lettuce wraps. I don't have to, I can make them myself fairly easily, but I would
Martin Yan is still around and on YouTube Uncle Rodger Fuiyohhhh. "Yan Can Cook"
Yan CAN Cook! I loved watching him on PBS! Thank you for this Uncle Roger 💜
“Uncle Roger social credit score gone up”😂💀
The first cooking knife I bought for myself with my own money at the age of 12 was Uncle Yans knife. It was awesome!
All the Gen X and Millennials having those feelings - If Yan can cook, so can you!
I think it would be quite good to watch you reviewing a few recipes of Ken Hom and see what you think of his dishes. he was the first experience i had of chinese cooking before my mandarin teacher!
Do u know there is another Yan tv chef in Canada? He was the one who started the show in America I think. Martin assisted him. And then, he went back to Canada. He was funnier I think. Not sure the accuracy of the story. Pls ask Martin Yan if u ever saw him. If not mistaken, his name is Steven Yan.
I also grew up watching Martin Yan.. he is an absolute legend.
Martin Yan is the ultimate OG uncle of uncles.  Yan Can Cook show was on PBS and I love watching his masterful fuiyoh of cooking every week.  Yes Uncle Roger, its time to make a collab video with the OG Uncle Martin Yan.  If Yan can cook, so can you.   Yan>Oliver
Early
As a Taiwanese, I can proudly say that Taiwan is a fake island and we live on battleships.
I hadn't even watched a millisecond of this video, and immediately liked it. Why? Uncle Roger talking about Martin Yan, that's why.  Martin Yan is someone who I've been watching since I was 8 years old, and have always had a fascination with him. I absolutely love his food, style, and just overall lovely demeanour.  Big ups, Uncle Roger for covering this absolute legend ❤
About time Uncle Roger.
Hoisin sauce already has sugar
taiwan u mean china? taiwan is china la
My grandmother didn’t have cable TV growing up. I grew up watching The Price Is Right, The Joy Of Painting and Yan Can Cook at her house. Those were the days.
Haiyaa Roger you are disappointing me but you always know what you did to me that why i throw your out!!       no one gonna even see this comment:(
Thanks for the video
still no air conditioning?
Dude I forgot about him, legend!
as a mongolian, i agree with Uncle Roger 0:52
1:13 A true BING CHILLING moment
Loved yan can cook! Still watch it every now and then.
According to China's new 100 dash line map, Malaysia isn't a real country either 😂
Fun fact: Martin Yan is a fellow UC Davis alumni.
I remember watching Yan can Cook on pbs in the eighties. He was amazing just like Uncle Roger!
I want to visit this made up country "Taiwan 🇹🇼" 😮
Oh man, I loved his show when I was a kid. Watch all his show while living in Vietnam
Remember watching ycc as a kid and being amazed at the huge cleaver he used. Now I'm watching thinking about how he was velveting the beef waaaay before anyone (American) had any idea
Can we please get more Uncle Yan videos? It so fun to see the differences between him and Uncle Roger
Sike uncle Roger when I was kid I used to love racing car and here I am being racist 🤌
So nostalgic! Get Martin Yan on your videos! 😂
Not enough pimpage.

fuck . 🧐
I remember his show back in the 80s
Love it, simultaneously razzes both Taiwan and China at the same time, true equality
Just grinded through all videos, new vid just in time
When I was in culinary school, I had the pleasure of working and learning from this awesome chef.  A memory I will never forget.
If Yan can cook,  So can You!
8:09 OMG HIS REACTIONNNNN XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Genghis Khan beef ??? Bell peppers & chili peppers come from South america. When Genghis Khan was alive, america was not "discovered" yet.
I would love to see uncle roger do a actual reaction to a real mongolian food
Taiwan has one of my favorite dishes, beef noodle soup
I was surprised about the lack of ginger, but I remember Mongolian beef or lamb being spicier than it usually is today. Now I see why. Thanks for sharing this.
Uncle Roger you should review made with lau Mongolian beef in your next Mongolian beef review
hungry。。。。。😢
If Yan can cook, so can you.  Ps: Except Jamy Oliver 😂😂😂
Wok with Yan ahhhh i miss this show
OMFG I REMEMBER YAN CAN COOK
Yan can cook very famous tv show back in the day, i watched alot alot alottttt
8:10 wait why you put your leg down from chair???? 😂😂😂
Martin Yan (Chinese: 甄文達; born 22 December 1948) is a Hong Kong-American chef and food writer. He has hosted his award-winning PBS-TV cooking show Yan Can Cook since 1982 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Yan)
YES! OG Martin Yan! If Yan can cook, so can you!
My brain exploded after the corn starch. I've been confused for YEARS!
HAIYAAAA, buy Air Con, buy Air Con ... Uncle was so cheap, so cheap ...
This is cool!
Damn yan cooking is the best thing
Man, I grew up watching Yan Can Cook.  That chopping was always amazing as a kid.
Please do one of "Made with Lau"'s videos
This video is peking good
I miss Martin Yan.  I grew up watching his show on PBS.
Martin was my hero growing up😊
Like uncle Roger ,Yan’s accent was super fake . Hilarious hearing him speak without it
hiyaaa get some air con your melting
Nostalgia to the max, dude. Yan Can Cook was one of the first cooking shows I ever watched, in the 80's on PBS. Probably started my love of cooking. Kick ass Uncle Roger!
I grew up with Wok With Yan (Stephen Yan) in Canada, and would love to see Uncle Rogers take on him and his Wok skills.
Cornstarch + MSG + Baking Soda for the home run!
Martin Yan is OG triple OG!!  Martin is Super Saiyan Uncle
Invite Uncle Yan to do egg fried rice together lar.....
.
Why does Uncle Roger sound like a crow at the end of the video 😂
Fuiyoh, even Martin Yan don't escape uncle roger eyes.  Yeyeahhhhh!
Haiyaaa why you say chili optional, grow some hair
I made dinner for me and my prom date from a Martin Yan recipe, stir fry chicken with black bean
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I miss 80s cooking shows, they were so much better than the hyperactive nonsense we deal with these days.
Two chefs with the surname Yan. Martin with “Yan Can Cook” and Stephen with “Wok with Yan”.
Corn in every form is the MSG of the US. They put it even in their cola.
Martin Yan has such knife skills because when he started working in a restaurant, for a couple of years he was only allowed to chop vegetables.  So not only did he learn to chop so fast, he also learned to cut vegetables such as carrots into decorative shapes, animals, etc.
❤❤❤
if there's no exact recipe for  Mongolian beef  then ho the fuck dose Uncle Roger think he is to review this vidio 😂😂
Fuyioh for Chef Yan  @ChefMartinYan
Wholesale video ❤❤❤❤
hoisin sauce is actually quite sweet. at least the one i own, dunno if it's supposed to be like that. because we're germans... and we hate asian countries. probably compensation von WW2.
Chef Yan was amazing, but he was hardly the first to bring Asian flavors to America.
This is funny
Yan is still kicking, he's only in his 70s. How can we make this collaboration happen?
He is rad
I’ve never been here so early before!
Martin Yan is a legend!
Wow, this brought me back to my teenage years. Ahh...the 80's - people who had cooking shows that really knew how to cook.
I loved this show.
sitting here laughing its a duck taco, hahaha I've had something similar in south Texas
We have a weekend ritual of watching you!  LOVE this one!!  Thanks for all your hard work.
So many opportunities to make a “pekpek” joke LOL
I grew up largely in the 90's on public network television. Children's programming was often pretty bland and boring at the time, so Yan Can Cook and the Frugal Gourmet were frequent staples of mine and my brother's daytime entertainment. The good stuff like Star Trek and the more interesting educational programming wasn't on until later, and over time that time slot was consumed by my siblings and my parents with boring, vapid nonsense like sports and talent show programs. So naturally, as I grew and was forced to seek entertainment from my hobbies and my computer rather than the TV, cooking and international food programs were always one of my primary fixtures.   Martin Yan was always at the epicenter of that.
"If yan can cook so can you" - what a inspiring quote from Martin yan . Didn't know he was the one who inspired Uncle Roger's love for cooking and also his side hustle of roasting chefs . 😜
Uncle rodger never disappoints ❤
My newborn son just tranced out to Martin Yan's chopping.....mid breast feeding.
i don't want to judge on it, you are the expert... but this wok... is this non-stick?
One question, when will nephew Nigel put a damn air-condition in this house, i get sweaty too
Uncle Roger what about Ken Hom?Please review Ken Hom 😆
5:33 You hear sizzling, I hear all the OGs exicting in happiness.
"Ooh Piglet, Uncle Roger is a bother but he does know filayvouhr,"  said Chairman Winnie, calmly.
If Yan can cook so can you
I remmeber watching him on pbs 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLO5GQ14ge4&ab_channel=Hell%27sKitchen  he was in an episode of hell's kitchen as well.
What is with the towel? food makes you so hot or you can't afford the AC bill?!
Day 1 of asking uncle roger to review future canoe
My brother and I would wake up early at 4am and watch Yan can cook. At dinner time when my mothers horrible cooking cane out we would say Yan can cook but not you!
When uncle roger said that Peking man look like aunty helen I wasn't expecting that😂
1st hourrr?
Uncle Rogers?  It’s been awhile… Glad, that you’d return “Air Bud.”
Martin Yan is my hero! I LOVED him in the 80's. He has 5 James Beard awards I believe; the last time I saw him online was on Hell's Kitchen as a guest judge a few years ago.
Uncle roger almost Cook nothing outside asia I wanted him to cook famous african food in african restaurant this is your challenge and I display rule right now no msg no wok Just african spices and ingredient
The only measurement Yan ever used was ‘a tiny bit’.
haiyaa one piece is bullshit, don't watch it, wait 20 years when the anime is completed and they do the movie-resummary of the 800 arcs, the rest is completely unwatchable. it's garbage.
This guy is awesome!!  I’m surprised Uncle Roger hasn’t put his knee down because of how amazing he is 🤣🤣🤣   2 options:   1. Put knee down because of mistakes or how horrible weejio is 😓😭😱  2. Put knee down because weejio was so good! 🥳🤩😋
I grew up on Yan Can Cook. Always remember, if Yan can cook, you can too!
Oh! Uncle Roger should review Wok with Yan. Stephan Yan was fire!
I have a copy of 'Yan Can Cook Book'. Holy cows and little lambs. Yummy. This recipe is not present... Must rewatch!!!
Grew up watching this OG, along with the Frugal Gourmet, Jacques Pepin, Wolfgang and of course BAM The legend Emeril Lagasse
In Canada we had something similar called Wok with Yan
"And speaking of orgasm, the only food get uncle roger close to that is..." then we skipped to "expressvpn" make it sounds so sus
I grew up with this too, along with Wok With Yan (Stephen Yan, different person). This was a Canadian show, and his wok puns were right on his apron each week.
Same accent damn.
What happened?? In London have no A/c.   You came to California with no A/c??        America hates you.  Lol .....     I love you.
You forgot about Wok with Yan. Classic. Goggle him. Martin actual worked for Wok with Yan in the early 80’s I believe.
Nigel.. I love your stuff bro. LOL the throw !! and damn your ex wife needs a shave ! lol Have a good Sunday !
under 30 minutes
In the 1980s, on PBS, there was a line-up of very good cooking shows.  My parents and I would watch them all with great attention, and Yan Can Cook was one of our favorites.  Another of his catch phrases was "nice and golden-brown".  We enjoyed his show very, very much!
Back in the 80s?  Home sick from school?  Tune on PBS in the afternoon and be entertained. No misnomer, Yan CAN cook.
4:19 Uncle Roger enjoying chopping ASMR
Pls review uncle Andy's lu rou fan uncle roger 🙏
The China stab 🤣🤣
i would always remember martin yan by his knife skills cutting a chicken with his one cut another cut...
Yan can cook, so can you! My childhood memory! 😆
In the Philippines, "Wok With Yan" was popular in the 90s. It was hosted by Stephen Yan, and I heard he's not related to Martin Yan. You should check it out too, Uncle Roger. 😊
I've been watching Martin Yan since I was a kid.   Yan can cook.
12:30 uncle roger becoming a crow lol 😂
please also review Wok with Yan😊
What
Uncle Rodger's the best !
Uncle Roger, you are a scream!
It was this and Iron Chef!!!
Lol,  that "祝君早安” towel😂
Uncle Roger is the best
hong kong roast duck is the shittiest thing ive ever tasted, go to tianjing or beijing
You nede msg😊
If Yan can cook...
I'm pretty sure uncle Roger thought as a kid that he would be reviewing his favorite chef
Martin Yan and Jacques Pépin! I've watched all their videos religiously 🥰
Canada had a show like this in the 80's.  I believe it was called  Wok with Yan.
In 80s.  No smg   In 80s coke 👃.
Grew up watching Yan Can Cook! 💗🥰🥰🥰😁
Damn I used to watch this Uncle show with my family when I was just a toddler. Just by hearing his voice makes me in a nostalgic mood rn
Mandrin pancake got me dyin
I loved Yan Can Cook.  I watched his show after school, before after school cartoons... His dishes were so easy to make... Great video... love the nostalgia.
pjp]
People my age use to watch judge Judy, Ricky lake and other crap like that, me on the other hand use to love watching Yan Can Cook
So if we're doing pbs chefs, how about the jaques pepin pho from the 80s?
JUSTICE FOR WILL!!!
If Yan can cook, So can you! We still say that sometimes in my home uvu so nostaglic~
I have the attention span but i do philosophy & ancient history. Its sort of necessary. Lol
I used to think Uncle Yan was obnoxious, but you've converted me. Fuyohhhh!
Stephen Yan > Martin Yan
Jamie oliver was born 1975, therefore there was a Jamie oliver back in the 80s. 😅
hi uncle roger i love ur vidjeos msg4life
You need air conditioner
Jimmy yang is right, old Chinese cooks work really fast😊
Uncle Yan using a second wok for decorative noodles is a showcase of peak WokFuckBoyery
I remember watching Martin Yan’s Chinatown on the Food Network as a kid.
Uncle Roger pls. Review Wok With yan
I remembered growing up to both Martin Yan and Stephen Yan. Both of them piqued my interest in cooking early, though that would take quite a while.
I hate bell pepper. Could I do this recipe and replace the bell pepper with something else?
That guys a legend
Really interesting cooking video! Never saw and knew how Mongolian beef was made! Fuiyoh!!!!!
Uncle Roger call Yan as Uncle, fuiyoh~~~
hayaaaa
80’/90’s was the age of Yan’s. Yan Can Cook and Wok With Yan were 2 of the best parts of morning TV
Yan Can Cook is widely available on YT folks. Great watching!
🛩️🏢🏢
I used to fake being sick so i could stay home from school to watch Yan can cook.  Best episode ever is when he put his kids into a (cold) wok and said "Look! They're Wok-ing"  OG for sure
CANCEL!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Uncle Roger too cheap too cheap. 8 millions subscribers and still no AC !!!!
5:12 at this point he’s just complimenting himself
8:09 😂😂😂
I live in China and have for the last 5 years. Uncle Roger didn't mention that without VPN express you cannot watch Uncle Roger in China. Btw, Chinese restaurants in Zhengzhou, where I live, don't serve any beef dishes. They just don't. Pork, chicken, fish, tofu.
My mate saw this guy when he was young, and thought his full name was Yan Can Cook. He said the reason he became a chef was because of his coincidental name haah.
When uncle roger upload my day get better every time ❤ I love your weejos uncle from syria 🇸🇾
When I was a kid in the early 90s I used to only watch Yan Can Cook I miss it so much.
No.5 Cancellation about to get real XD
Martin yan is the G.O.A.T.
As a Taiwanese  All I can say is     Thanks for the sarcasm
I have one of Martin's autographed Cook books. My mother got it while in the audience for the show! He's my hero too!
Uncle Roger really went from (sort of) generic youtube react content to a serious food chanel for homecooks (with a laugh) and actually giving great advise about asian cooking. I think you motivated a lot of people (like me) to cook asian food as correct as possible. I even got a rice cooker. I loved the video you did with guga and josh, and you actually kept up compared to josh his cooking.   Great direction this channel is heading towards.
Imagine him busting out a line for u 😂
Loved watching him cook back in the day
fun fact: Uncle Roger kept his leg up on chair. Because Martin Yan never disappoints unlike Jamie Oliver haaiya.
I watched him every week
This is like watching a student review a master
Foyooooh
Yan is the Goat with the chopping skills
For 18 white people I died. lmao
You know when Uncle Roger posts a video about reacting to food is gonna be fantastic 👌
Peking duck is just Chinese taco.
As a kid, I hated him because his show was before afternoon cartoons. Now in 2023, I wish I spent time watching Martin Yan's shows  PS: Uncle Roger using a Good Morning Towel?! That is so cool
Genghis khan liked his women spicy. If you were born in mongolia, the chances of you being a part of genghis' family is 1/3
You can never talk bad about him he what showed me how you cook I love this man
Fuyooh!!
"If Yan can cook so can you!"
Good recipe for today 👏👏👏
Uncle Roger is sweatin! My a/c is broken at the moment so I’m right there with you haiyaaaa.

Akhirny review martin yan jg
Uncle Roger must be roasting guys back in the 80s too
I never get tired of the social credit score jokes.
In the USA in the 80's, we feared HIV, MSG, and USSR.
8M subs and dude can't afford AC?
Love this, fuiyohhhh! ❤ (And I’m early!)
Dang it Uncle Roger got to it before I could type about that second Taiwan mention.🤣😂
I grew up in the '80s watching this and till this day I still say if yan can cook you can too at least once a week
I can't unsee Uncle Roger insulting Jamie Oliver in first 30 second in his every video.
Martin Yan was one of my favorite chef's, when I was young
yoooo
In the video Uncle Roger was in 1080p but Martin Yan was in 144p in the same frame... And its confusing me so much
Uncle Roger, Taiwan is a real country, China isn't real. you have Taiwan and West Taiwan
Can you please do more UNCLE ROGER works at 🥺
early
Oh yan can cook. Back those days in liang po po collab .
Uncle Roger ain't gonna spare the Jr Oliver if he fcks up asian dishes☠️
Straight from Guga's review of Salt bay and now Doggie here
80s cooking show still better quality than paranormal potato quality videos in 2023 🎉
Ayeeeee my grandma used to watch it! I didn’t see her watching it but my dad always told me about it!
I forgot how much i missed Martin Yan's show...
MSG brought me here :)
身為台灣人，這不好玩……
0:34 I was in sync with that 🤣🤣. But i can recall watching Chef Martin Yan on PBS at 6 years old. Wanting to be a chef. Him Justin Wilson, &  Mary Ann Esposito are just a few who inspired me FUIYOH!!
Martin Yan! My hero too and you are my hero also. Thank you. You are real, hilarious and wonderfully entertaining.
"hope he can make better fried rice than his dad".....YEAAAHH!!"                                 Uncle Roger 2023
"Taiwan not even real county" Famous last words
It’s so nice to see a Vintage TV Show back on the channel! Next on the list should be Madhur Jaffrey.
The one motto I will always remember from my childhood is  "If Yan can cook, so can you!". The man is a legend.
What a roller coaster of a social credit score xD
As a mongolian i can say that this dish is pretty similar to something we call "khorkhog" which is meat veggies and rocks inside a pressure cook in which we cook on top of campfire it comes out really good and we keep the rocks in our hands until it becomes cool its a really cool tradition we do
If Yan can cook, so can you! ❤️
Wait ik yan YANXNZ idk he was cooking
Is it just me or do Uncle Roger and Martin Yan sound VERY similar Edit: Uncle Roger noticed it too lol
I wish I was in the UK I would love to try the food there
1:08 the moment when uncle roger got cancelled
Legends say Uncle roger is still trying to fix his social credit score
Uncle Roger...Up here in Canada, we have a show very very similar. It's called Wok With Yan. He is our OG Uncle. We'd love for you to review him. You can find episodes here on YouTube. :)
He still manage to roast jamine oliver
I didn’t know that Martin Yan existed
Uncle Martin Yan Fuiyooh
So is he Grandpa Yan?
Uncle Roger, please review the Indian chef
HE IS GOAT!!!!!
Yan Can Cook!   ive seen him live when i was young!   was so nice n food was good too
I LOVE M.S.G I think Uncle Roger should start his own M.S.G  factory 🏭
Yan, he born in the village next to mine. No worry sure he can cook, we all eat the best food in the world.
Old
Hello uncle roger
Uncle roger help me jamie Oliver was trying to assassinate you but they kidnapped me because i am also asian. Haiyaaaaa
Before Jamie Oliver most people could’ve made better fried rice
OMG.  Thank you Uncle Roger.  I started typing before I even watched.  Martin Yan from Yan Can Cook, what a great surprise.  Great show.  Hi Mr. Yan.  Thanks again.
I m early . I m early . Yayy
lol Uncle Roger Taiwanese here, you have done that Taiwan joke before, I think you can do better xD
This show is older than Nephew Nigel.
I was in love with his chopping demo
uncle roger never fails to make me laugh i swr
Yan Can Cook was my favorite show and I really enjoyed his show. Martin Yan did a show about Peking Duck and did three dishes with one duck.
Wai uncle Roger delete previous vegio?
OMG MARTIN YAN HE'S THE REASON WHY I LOVE FOOD SHOWS
"Taiwan not even real country"        -Uncle Roger last words before getting cancelled
When I make my stir fry, I started making it by marinating the meat with soy sauce, corn starch and msg because of you lol. It upped my stir fry game. Don't forget to wash your rice (some angry person on tiktok yells at me about it 😂)
Martin Yan was awesome. Loved that show.
Love from India
Including Taiwan. Love it.
You can’t fuck with Yan. I still make a dish called ging du pork. It’s the bomb
Uncle Roger is my fav food critique fr
WOK THE HECK!?!

I can cook
OMG, I grew up watching Martin Yan! Thank you so much for this Uncle Roger! Because of Yan can cook, I always found it weird that TV chefs/cooks never shared their food with the audience after the show, haha!
Finally  the first person who has the uncle title
Uncle roger is only asian who can say haiyaa and don't cry
Uncle Roger is perfect to sit back, relax and grab some snacks. His vibe is on point
uncle roger should start a cooking/comedy show and just roast people when cooking 😂
Not the first but 2 min ago!
