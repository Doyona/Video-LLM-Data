I'm thinking what you're thinking.
Nobody’s Diamonds Was Fucking wit Hutch’s jewelry Shit Hit Different Rest N peace Hutch
After Listening to Sauce Walka "Sanchie P's Maybach" brought me hear.
He got set up!
first thing that comes to mind, is he was mixing fakes with real diamonds. Also he sells high, and buys low. So if you sell jewlery to him he will give a penny on the dollar.
DETROIT IS SO DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT! AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE! 😰💔
Thank you everyone for not  mixing color into this. It's a sad day in that community  😞
God bless you 🙏
When you choose to swim with SHARKS , you get bit and lit !  Crazy how people get intoxicated with CASH 💰……THEY LITERALLY GIVE UP EVERYTHING ! For it …..EVERYTHING 😊
RIP
Def a targeted hit, dude shot him a whole bunch. He wanted to make sure 100% he was dead.
Lock it away from society forever. Not properly raised and obviously completely unfit for society. Also stop wearing expensive jewelry. It’s just narcissistic and dumb.
Apparently his own attorney was behind his murder. So sad. May God be his family during this hard time. RIP. ♡
Get the Lawyer
That was a hit they just took out Duke the jewelry to smh,they don't want us making NOOOOO$$$$$$$$$ OR BUILD NO WEALTH ETC ETC...👀🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Once you get some money, you go spend it with Hutch and get you some Buffs...way to keep the priorities straight...
big boy said he" ran" up there to see what happened 💀
But guns are illegal in Chicago how did he get shot. Man it's almost like if you didnt have unconstitutional gun laws he could of had his own gun
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Smfh
Set up
"when you get you some money, you want to go spend it with Hutch" he catered to the Black and IGNORANT
Smells like some deeper shit. Even the news anchor knows.
Noooo! This is a inside JOB!!  How in the Hell !!!!  Did she not get hit???  All I'm gone 💯 say !!  Don't believe me and you know a TRILL Killer! Not this real shit yall claim. Ask em!!
These killers sound jealous smh....
This shit hurts
Damn
Smh this idiot said when you get some money you go spend it at the jewelry store wtf
Man yall stay out the way and make yall money PEOPLE are dyin bruh this shit aint right 🤦🏾
So just because others buy it now you all should . I played on the streets for years and never wore jewelry it’s a waste of money you never get back what you paid once it leaves that store the value had gone down and your now a target idk to each your own that’s just my stupid opinion
People always trying take instead of work 😭😭🙏
Lando yo ish know
I'm I'm all the way in Atlanta. And I know about hutch. That's crazy
R.I.P Dan, One of the best jewelers and kindest man you could ever meet
It was about a chain.
akways killed by someone you know,
He was an informant and they put a hit on him  You play w the bulls get the horns
9 grouped shots at close range?? Somebody was mad and wanted some get back💯
Wow that extremely sad, plus didn't even know there was another OP besides here in sactown OP and CH are home.
Probably a set up but who knows people are bum haters
Sad but Hearing randy name rappers at the end was a joy😇🤣
jewelry and hood does not mix
What type of city requires a man to have security to pick him up??? A violent one and deadly one. I pray everyday that I live in 🇨🇦...  RiP Hutch 🙏
So sad lagend of shine star on jealous situation of business so had to say goodbye rest in peace hutch
Why shoot him.
Someone hateing
Fuck rap!
He was so cool with everyone and that was his mistake, someone close got ideas to rob him since he wasn’t bout that life. Someone got greedy or hating that he couldn’t afford jewelry and decided to double cross him, or had a friend do it to not draw suspicion. RIP tho
Poor mindsets buying BS jewelry to make him rich but don't invest into your Blk communities. WILLIE LYNCH SYNDROME 🤡🤡'S 😐😴
They didnt even get anything
♥️⚖️ keeping true
Well placed shots I see, that was personal yall. That man probably had his hands tied up in something else. It ain’t random. Rip tho
Sharing their Culture with folk again.  RIP Dan.
Damn r.i.p. hutch did the chain
Right now I hope a lot of people just lay low, spend more time with your family.
Will the inmates will take of him if they others and advise turn urself in. Fast
Disgusting People Getting Murder Killed Shot In Our Country In Our Communities Our Cities Our Streets  And Nothing Being Done  More Lights In Our Dirty Streets Our Cities  All Dark Waiting To Get Rob Or Shot By A Thug  Who Responsible For Our Communities With No Law And Order Enforcement  Patrolling Our Dark Dirty Streets
His brother set him up jk u never know thoe

Wonder why people are fleeing these neighborhoods. You take out businesses in any community you take out the heart. Good luck
Like Alpo truck that had to been a hit

This is horrible!  R . I . P.
SMH bum ass ninja doing the most!!!
They killed Hutch I never got to buy some hood trophies
They said he was working with them ppl🤧
This is Awful! The amount of idiots with Guns is absolutely ridiculous. Idiot control, not Gun control.
Real talk he must have did some foul s*** to somebody?? Because the way I see it it wasn't about any robbery they want to kill that man cuz he did some foul s***
https://youtube.com/shorts/WoOnhKD1490?feature=share WHO GOT THE CASH
Yet 🤨 suspicious How he left an witness
Sad 😔
The wife’s side dude plus a life insurance policy…..or selling bogus jewelry and talked crazy to somebody not with it
Such a sickening pointless callus murder of one of the community’s most liked dude’s))   Doing all the hard work he did to set himself and his family up with jobs and a living trying to have a good  future )) proper businessman and someone got very jealous of him making money  etc etc etc ))
Its the killing Season or what
That person you do this will get death
Expensive Jewelry is 1 of the worst things you can buy & not even be able to sell it for half of what you paid for it the next day, unless you have generational weath & you're worth millions there's no good reason to spend $10k or $40k on a piece of jewelry.
Let me guess a nigga was the shooter?
It's a hit by the wife!!!🤦🏾‍♀️
I swear all they drink in Detroit is bitch juice. So glad I left.
From the glass they look like head shots lol lol 😂😂😂😂
Another leach getting money in black hood go take that stuff to the rich hood
Ah ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
if you make millions around a place full of violence and criminals , it should be common sense knowing you need a BULLETPROOF TRUCK , not anybody would like you
He must have fucked over the wrong person
How sad...EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DID IT.
🙏🏾
Never mix business with hoodlums that been cursed for thousands of years .   -enough said
Smh
So very sorry to family and Friends! .
I DECLAREThieves& HOODLUMS GET ON MY DARN Nerves🙆🏾HE WAS a Cool Guy I met him a few years ago in 2016 ,when I was attempting to gain him as Client for a Marketing company I worked for at the Time. He didn't become a Client BUT He was STILL Very Nice to me during our first time Meeting.RIP HUTCH🥀🕊️🥀🕊️🥀🥀🕊️🥀🕊️🥀
Be aware and protect yourself

Shit is sad. I left Detroit at 19 I'm 27 love my life and daughter. We have to do better
Interviewed dudes brother did it I bet.
Fake crys fake smiles you never know now a days,may god show us the way
👂👀📲💻 tv
Wife set him up. We know how these things go
Why dude smiling while talking about a dude that was killed?
Accept Grace into your life. Send it to everyone you meet. It's really the only thing standing between you and judgement.
Those nine shots are in the shape of a pyramid.
Oh 😐
They are REAL quiet regarding the suspect in custody, I wonder why?
No respect for life nowadays it seems. Disgusting and unacceptable
It's so funny, hearing news reporters. saying rappers names.
Thugs and hooligans from Black Lives Matter BLM going   on killing spree to collect slave repreations Target whites
City hurt behind this 1...💔 Rip Hutch💎
Wake up America
Did BLM do this?
Probably his wife
When the fuck is our government gonna step in and stop this war on it's citizens? Send military into all bad areas to patrol. Schools and hospitals should have military personal on guard. I don't give a fuck about how it makes you feel innocent people are dying!! My fellow Americans are being murder everyday.. AND I'M FUCKING TIRED OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just shopped with his store a couple weeks ago rip
Oh geez all these shootings but which group is putting up the majority of these statistics?
Does this mean that "follow home robberies" are a thing now here as well? Oh well...
That means he probably sold some fake diamonds
Probably sold some fake
😩 Starving MFs need to hustle,grind,or off yourself before first 🤦🏾‍♂️ Dawg built a brand to feed his loved ones & just like dat robbed of his life by some lames ! Damn.. Rest up Boss
I'm surprised his vehicle wasn't bullet proof!
DAMNNNNN NO WAY. RIP HUTCH
So sad I just grabbed a chain and pendant from hutch he showed so much love to everyone this is mind blowing
Ridiculous. Prayers for the family.
Definitely not professional hit....weird
He dont give back to our community and our ppl die everyday
What color skin was the shooter? JK i already know
Nah, Detroit niggas turn on each other
He probably owned that shop for years and now he is gone 🙏🏾
Sounds like a setup/robbery….😕
They gone off'em in that Michigan system. Sad all the way around smh Long Live Hutch!
Sad🙏
blew his musty ass off...
Very sad.
“Mad at mike like whyd you go to hutch an fuck yo bezel up”
A dumb rapper finally realize the Jewlery is Fake.
Is Dr. Bob from the psychedelic healing shack really dead?
Who's next? The dentist.
Detroit hutch ?
A lesson not to sell or deal to cocolos......or else..........
Damn that’s F-ed up. RIP Sir. Can’t even be a business owner without someone trying to take your life.
Its the gangsta culture...violent raps / vids / grills ,guns , girls  New  Rap songs wil be created. Ballons bought.. lots of ballons #BLM-strong  13/56
Just ugly and evil, not a cop or detective but something smells like 💩 certainly looks like someone knew he was getting in truck on some sniper type shit especially given the wife didn't get hit 🤔
There Will  Be No Stores! In These Niehbor Hoods! And You All Will Wonder Why!😒😒😒
Thugs! 😒😒😒
What like 15 shots dammHaters
Damn it's hard being successful in America, if you going to Rob somebody due just that, killing ain't cool.
So very sad.
I have considered him our family jeweler since his his Northland days.. Really sad to hear
Now let’s see if any of the Blackmen who loved Hutch so much Open they Own Jewelry store!!!?!??!??
Dawg I'm so sick they took my dawg Big Hutch out like that he was a great guy man Rest in Paradise
So sad 😞 it’s so much love towards him & at same time people always jealous comeing from the streets & made a change in my community theirs always hate .
The Government fault. Usa is cursed  because of slavery
My condolences to the family praying for the family this is crazy and ridiculous
Handle your bidness, community. You know this man wasn't about screwing people.
🙏❤
12 rounds to his driver side no robbery yeah he fxcked someone over.
I’m so sick of these sorry broke ass dudes running around thinking they can take something they have no backbone to get honesty but now he finna go down and be someone’s punk. Karma is a muthafucka!!!!
Rip joy road
Well Done Officer    Why kill this man?        EVIL
All those bullets through the drivers window, how could the wife not  get hit, if she was sitting in the passengers seat!!
Probably ripped off some gang member... sold him fake diamonds or something
Should have given the refund and not sell fake jewelry, betcha that the reason. It wasn’t a robbery.
Rip
strange how the other person in the vehicle did not get hit
Johnny dang jumping for joy right now 🤣 .
Clearly was a inside job
Baby tron gives his condolences..........
Fairveiw
📌 "Especially if you're from Detroit one of "thangs" you do when you get some money you wanna get you a chain." A chain to symbolize the BS culture that have you bound in bondage; when your ancestors were freed from wearing chains and shackles. SMH.
Damn babytron gotta ball out now smh rip
Nothing but condolences
So sad You can't even make a living anymore without criminal  motherfuckers robbing you....so sick of these thug POS punks
Where the ladies at? Oh. It's hip hop - nevermind... Who's son/brother/daddy is this?
This hit will be the local . Rapper thugs new song what a junk culture
This is Horrible..... God bless his family , I send my condolences 😥🙏🏿❤️
If you had to go to war with these elected or Trump "officials" Republicans do you actually think they would stand shoulder to shoulder with you? The true answer is no. They are as gutless as Bone Spurs Trump and run for the hills. Such frigging cowards. I bet Ted Cruz would be the first to arrive at the hills. What is wrong with these White Republicans people?
He got himself into something he probably was selling fake diamonds or lab made which could make niggas mad
You know the city is a graveyard when even the jeweler is a target .
That don't look like no robbery. That looks like a straight up hit.That jeweler was a sitting duck.It was personal because he could had shot the wife to.My deepest sympathy to his wife and family. I'm sick of all this gun violence and deaths.
Condolences man:(
Black mega mind .
Just hoping the wife was not involved?
The fucking wife set this up boy y’all crazy to think other wise
Why wouldn't you kill the witness? The wife was unharmed?
That's how some people like to live. Killing everyone and anyone.
It's a ICE AGE in the D...Cold blooded.....R.I.P
Can't have nothing around thugs
God doesn’t let people get away with crimes. Cold-blooded killers DON’T go to Heaven.
So his wife was in the truck and didn’t get  hit…yeah. Gotcha
Follow the money 💰 🤑 💸 💰
REALY BECOMEING INSANE
SO SAD
There are certain demographics you don’t want to cater to👍🏿. Even President Trump kept them out of his luxury highrises. Most Jewelry stores & Pawn shop owners are armed! Unfortunately, he got caught lacking, especially when the hood think you are rich! I left Hood Atlanta for Jewish Beverly Hills and I will never go back💯.
Had to be something personal them many shots definitely not a robbery.
RIP Hutch!
Those are his friends that have killed him
"Yea, you knowm em saying, Detroit nows way less better offs and stuffs now that a player can't get him sum goochie glasses and chain's from Hutchinsons.  What da he'll we over hur at the hip hop lab gonna do? 🤔" ~Offical Detroit  Spokes Person and stuffs~
Definitely not random 9 holes put into the driver's side window this was either Personal or a hit for something Personal!!!
Shouldn’t be selling rappers fake jewelry
It’s da blatt culture…..wite Trump maga racist supporter my guess at medical school
Out of nowhere ……BS….everyday in Wakalanaudan
My condolences to the family and friends.
How is it that they killed the guy but leave a witness behind meaning his wife!? I smell foul play here! Seems to me it looks like it could’ve been a hit…. Allegedly just saying. It’s probably somebody who he knows….
Why did the man see the need to kill him?
SILENCE THE VIOLENCE 😡
A LOT OF DETROIT/FLINT RAPPERS RAP ABOUT HIM
Sad but I buy from BOB Only! (BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES)
1:25 The Biggest problem in the Black Community...
So, if you see another pond shop/ jewelery store go up... then.......🤔 My condolences to all the family, friends and loyal customers 🙏 💔
You can't have money & be around people that have nothing
When we start demanding for these criminals to be executed in public, then we will see a damn change!!!!
Young Democrat thugs rule USA streets huh!
Selling fake diamonds 🤦🏾‍♂️ allegedly
We all done be spending our money on De bling an flash Sos we be like de gangster rappers  !
he had got someone mad the wrong one
🙏🙏🙏
Racist jewelers don’t care about blacks anyway
Too much flexing
My sincerest condolences 🙏🙏🙏 R.i.p Mr. Hutch
They glorify this stuff he doesn't deserve that
So sad wish this man had security to pick him up at the end of each day, it’s obvious this man was a well liked city legend to many, sending condolences to the family and May this great business man Rest In Peace ❤️🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊❤️🕊
Definitely a hit 🤷🏿‍♂️🤫
Detroit always look like one big pile of garbage, every video I see.
My heart goes out to his children and his wife and mother and immediate family.  I do not know him but I live nearby. Another father killed. Another family wrecked for life. What is really going on with the world ? Come on people! Let’s stop killing each other ! It doesn’t make any sense.  BE SAFE OUT THERE 🙏🏼 sorry for the loss to the community and beyond 😔💔
Always the same criminals BLM  BURN LOOT MURDER
They robbed him??
Lando know any clout he can get he gone try his best. 😂😂😂🤣
These kids are getting out of hand. No way a man would do this to hutch. RIP
Damn smh. I'm from maryland  and enjoy purchasing jewelry from hutch. He played fair and kept it real💯. These 🤡🤡 thinks killing is the solution for everything. Hutch was liked and luv by many. Condolences to the family. R.I.P Hutch.
Isn’t worth having a business in Detroit
Sounds like a leak within the Police Dept. You can’t play both sides of the fence forever. Of course I’m only speculating.
So horrible so sorry 😞 for your family I hate these bums in Detroit
Jealous of his success?
Never let the killer out, never!
Rip   sorry for ur loss
Should have bought a bulletproof car
Tesla bullet proof truck is definitely hit
Dismal rundown location. He should have relocated. Instead some punk relocated him.
Who’s surprised? This is what happens when u sell to black ppl…
Didn't his dad shoot him that's what I heard from a crackhead
Sound like he was targeted...probably a contract hit.
RIP Hutch... the real 🧊🧊man
Darn, there goes the hood.
That's sad
Slide for Hutch
Rip to the buff king
Who
Sending love and prayers from Oakland
We have got to do better smh! Prayers 🙏🏾
The city that robbed and beat Rosa Parks. No one is safe with so many pathetic people roaming the streets.
Get some money spend it on jewelry not you kids future.
WTF ...sick...so sorry
It's time to declare Martial Law!!! This butchering across this country has to stop! What's wrong with people here? They are born criminals, for sure!!! It's time to take actions, real actions, yes, get the Military involved!!!
This was a hit 🎯
Rumor has it hutch was about to testify on someone in a federal case
🥺🥺
Enjoy your 2nd Amendment!
Sad for him and his family… but never heard of him till now .. prayers to his family
Detroit is a dead zone
Wad du your xpect from that hip hop Rap music ?
Rip Hutch 😇 the whole city is hurt after this tragedy 🥹💔
Who’s the suspect?
9 bullet holes 🕳 in that window they meant to kill him
Usual suspects I'm sure. Don't say anything about the protected class
Sad
If u listen to Detroit rap u kno exactly who hutch is.   RIP HUTCH
WTF!!!!! WHY WHY WHY TO ALL YOU FUCKIN SHOOTERS GO SHOOT YOURSELF!!!!! THIS IS ALL BAD 🥺😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This is what happens when you vote Democrat for decades.
Sumbody most likely told on they people where they got jewelry from put his name in it came back with no receipt…u know the rest …2021 was jewelers worst nightmare because they couldn’t turn all that money down but u see out come…all money ain’t good money
Im betting he was all about supporting blm and the community he served and lost his life to one of them, smdh
So sad!
I bet this was sum bums who came up off sum unemployment or ppp loan and mad they ain’t have they paperwork right
🙏🏿
I wish blacks united like this with each other when a life is lost crazy how they cry over non black but quick to down their own.this man was selling fake diamonds and got killed
Man R.I.P HUTCH
People are completely shitty! Thankfully the police caught them
Biden's America
No one deserves this. But it's amazing the case was psbly, literally solved overnight when the victim isn't blk.
Who's going to fill the void
Damm
I’m a tell you something that’s going around the city of Detroit that I live in that the news is not telling you I don’t know hutch I never did business with them but supposedly a lot of jewelers been getting confronted by the feds The feds is trying to figure out why somebody can afford a $50,000 chain that they show on Instagram and they listen to the rappers so a lot of time the feds will try to build a case on somebody by going to the jeweler in if the jeweler didn’t report the over $10,000 purchase that they supposed to they try to jam the jeweler up once again I’m not saying they did that to Hutch but they’ve been doing that to a lot of the popular people who sell High end jewelry around Detroit
He was robbed 🤔
Wow😳🙏 the world is dangerous not jus Detroit be aware of ur surroundings  Move like everybody after you👀
When are we going to start gunning down these sewer rats who run around hiding in the shadows?
🥲
RIP
And when the Rapper get the Rock's it's time to make rain at Gentlemen's Clubs and befast and roll down and up 8mile and start the shit all over again or a Babies MA"A or Golddiggers a dancer would start all types of off the everything shit plus plus.He was a good Brother Man to so many all people if you need a job and know someone that needs help he was a good hook-up or something like that not a fool to any type of games.This saying like a carjackers plans gone all damit wrong he was thinking that he can get Mr. and H not on point and with a big gun and plus plus it would make him feel like he's running the show on all the Internet.Take the couple to ATM or home make someone open the safe and plus plus he might think it's more same place else or just will ???? And drive in the coulpes vehicle and go ahead with the rap and money to show off again on the Internet plus plus please we need to hope the court system works on behalf of all of Detroit and so many people and The H.Familes and Friends !!!  (R.I.P.)
RIP mane
R.I.P. HUTCH….he was the guy that could make you, your dream piece! Sad world we’re living in these days!
I have more videos saved about gun violence than any other list. This is insane.....
Get that hate out your heart...
Damn this had to be a set up
Sick world with sick and  materialistic people
WHIPS and CHAINS!    have always been An issue!
Datz brazy for wat doe
Sooo sad senseless
Alll Baaad‼️‼️
Stop supporting these people!!! They do nothing but take from our community, we’re literally at the bottom of society, especially Detroit… we need to invest our money back into ourselves
His wife wasn't hurt and no robbery
2 guesses...
Damn this the dude baby tron be talkin bout🧐
We lost a truely great guy.  Hutch was a pillar of Detroit  guy could not have been more charitable gave back to so many in need.  Rip buddy
Sad to hear, although I can't say I'm surprised this seems to be a running theme with those involved in dealing with the" hip hop" community.
Who killed Hutch?
I feel for his family,  but I'm sorry,  but I believe some how the Wife was involved!!  It's odd and suspicious that she wasn't  harmed!!  Why leave a Witness???
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank god they caught the shooter
This generation smh 🤦🏿‍♂️
When you're showing your money off and showing people that you have money because you're wearing a big-ass diamond and gold chains and then wonder why somebody committed a crime on you it's because you have money and you're showing it off Levi children world at Golden diamonds maybe that wouldn't happen as much again if we just put criminals in a jail cell and leave them and if they commit a murder death penalty you take a life then your life is forfeit unless it's true self defense but until then we're going to commit crime a murder people even if he didn't have it done I bet they would have committed that crime with a knife or a bucket catcher criminals up and leave them there this will continue to happen
Ik babytron sick i got hip to hutch from tron
Who’s the suspect…….
BACKDOOR WAS OPEN FA BUSINESS
now no jewelers gonna work with y'all How dumb of u detroit pple i hope u get caught
Nice auction car tho
Why was he shot?
WE IN OUR LAST DAYS.....RIP
I’m so sick of these criminals!! People can’t work hard for their money without being on guard that they may be robbed.
Jealousy
Can’t hardly do anything in this country now without being shot.
I hope it wasn't rapper related. That would make it an even bigger blow to the city
He did something you don’t shoot them many time trying to rob
Damn shame.
Wife open that back door …check the policy out
Guys lucky the cops got him b4 the streets did
Fuck dude. Rest in peace Hutch. Haten ass mother fuckers. You can't make no money without some body trying to take it
Made all that money off the hip hop culture...which celebrates the kind of violence that took his life....
When the subculture is explained to be a detriment to yourself and your loved ones but you continue to do so means you're an idiot. education can save your life.
Another pile of filth takes out a valued community member! Pathetic
GOD SPOKE TRUTH TO THOSE WHO HAVE PERSONAL BUSINESS COMPANY AND WEALTH  NEVER LET YOUR RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT YOUR LEFT HAND IS DOING.  ITS GOOD TO BE IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S TOO MANY WHO ARE ENVIOUS AND JEALOUS. BETTER TO TRUST FAMILY MEMBERS RELATIVES AND IN-LAWS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE PEACE LOYALTY HONESTY AND TRUTH TO PROTECT WHAT'S IMPORTANT
Whoever did this got caught fast I’m wondering do they think it was really worth it now smdh no wins in this gun violence stop the madness!!!!!
Noooo NOT HUTCH bsbytrons jeweler 😭
it's a shiesty summer
maybe he sold a fake diamond
My deepest condolences to the mans family and friends.  Catch the perp, and support our police.  No Police, No Peace. As we are watching our country being shot up and mass murders, car jackings skyrocketing, freeway shootings, normal people just out and about going to work being gunned down for a phone a handbag, a wallet, or a measly $14.00. This shit is imported from other countries, because it has coincided with the open border policy of Biden/Harris and the corrupt lying  DHS secretary Mayorkas.
Wtf
Damn I’m glad they caught the shooter so the family can have some justice & closure.. I know people keep saying he was snitching and working with the feds because he provided receipts on customers but a legit business is not supposed to take the fall for people using illegal money to buy legal items when they get caught by the feds.. should’ve turned that money legal first idiots 🤷🏾‍♂️😭🤣
...CITY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF BUM ASS PEOPLE ... I WOULD NoT SELL YALL AIR.
They always go after the people in the community.
Cowards. So sorry for the family and loved ones.
Lord have mercy.
Because BLM killed.him
Man gotta.support blm
That dude’s glasses are worth more than most houses in Detroit
I bet it was one of his customers that killed him.
Made a comment but You Tube's censorship that they borrowed from Facebook is ridiculous. Stupid people think a chain is a good investment. Smart people actually invest that money into something that will show a return over time.
Smh! RIP Hutch! 💔🙏🏾
I think the wife had something to with his demise because why didn't they kill her as well she didn't get injured or nothing she definitely set him up She was probably tired of the cheating
Someone young and dumb did this hutch was so cool and wouldn't have never expected that to happen to him it's a damn shame
The race of the suspected shooter was not mentioned...surprise, surprise, surprise... p.s. It does tell me the shooter wasn't a straight White man...
Probably shady deal on stolen good or ripping shady people pawn shop industry are all dodgy
This is insane. I'm surprised he didn't have on a minimum of 2 firearms on him.
"Welcome to Detroit City" where it's a nice town but things can get real gritty.
Dumbass wanted that hip hop Money and all he got was hip hop billets
RIP I’m from Florida but heard hutches name dropped for years
Don’t ever spend more than 10k with a jeweler if you have street money… they are supposed to declare any cash purchases over 10k and they often don’t. So then if the feds are looking at you and they see you don’t have any legit form of income but you are posting a 30k chain on social media they are going to go put down on your jeweler and ask them if they want the felony charge for not declaring the money you spent with them OR do they want to help their case on YOU. Hood jewelers frequently cooperate with law enforcement… they look the other way on the shady shit they do with their cash in return for information on big players in the city…. I’m telling you this is a fact. I think it’s stupid to buy expensive jewelry in the first place but if you are doing dirt and making street money be very careful with how you move around jewelers… they are an easy target for detectives and feds to get info… they have a business and a family and they are not going to risk any of it to protect you
RIP why are these folks not traveling in bullet proof vehicles? Smh
Anyone else see the “biggest scammers in hip hop are the jewelers” video? I seen in it in my timeline and literally 3 days later ole bruh got killed
Damn, glad they caught the dude
Simple case. When he said he owned a Jewellery store, I knew he had to also be in the Pawn business.  Always customers who can't afford to buy their jewellery back who will make death threats.  Security is essential.
Wow I don't know what to say. Rest in eternal peace, Dan. Very gracious guy
They say he was snitching and working with the police 🤷‍♂️
Their community is in complete and total crisis and sinking into the abyss.
🕊
Hit
Public execution!!
They wearin chainz trying to show they ain’t porn no more and all it does is make them look like fools wanting attention
Sucks minorities think gold and Nike shoes are the must have in life.
Bet you blm was involved
R.I.P H
maybe the business gone bad between the partner
He beat someone out and thought he couldn’t be got 🤷‍♂️
Surprised??
Damn Hutch ❤️🙏🏾
Miza stimulas money went to somes chains.
Daaamm they dropped Hutch 🤦🏾‍♂️
I wanna know who did it and who had the hit pulled
America gun culture take notes from Canada mass shooters and thugs
I can’t believe it Hutch was the nicest person on earth I am happy I got to see home on Monday love you rip
A darn shame!!!  He shud have had security...  Prayers to his family...  THE Criminal didn't get anything from the crime except LIFE N PRISON.   PLZ LET THIS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS LOVED ONES SETTING HIM UP
Lawless America.
To all my fellows we shouldnt hurt our brothers in any matter way, we all live in a community that we should make it greater and safe for your young ones to live a life of joy . If u can’t see that u have no heart being in this earth because to live u must live life to the fullest . Sad to see killings an nothing can be done at the moment of impact .so I say we shouldn’t kill or hurt one to another
Can’t trust no heathens 💯
My Condolences 💐  Hutch 🌹
My Condolences 💐 Hutch 🌹
That’s so fucked up and lame 🤬 RIP 🙏🏽
Ain’t nothing new it’s Detroit the most ghetto city in America
Owned a jewelry/pawn shop in OAK PARK. Clients included hip hop stars which are mostly gang bangers and thugs.  What could possibly go wrong?
Black people are always proud to get money then give it away to the white man. "It's a blow to the city" Meanwhile if it happened to you I can guarantee you he wouldn't say the same thing
🗣HUTCH DID THE CHAIN! Rip baby!!!!
Damn. Stop snitching.
Dang.
seemed like a good guy. RIP.
Haha 😂
Sending my love and condolences.  Damn Detroit C'MON Now Hutch. YALL. gotta have more respect for your legacy holders. DAMN HUTCH DOG YOU WAS A STAPLE OF THE CITY.  VERY UPSET WITH DETROIT RIGHT NOW.
So what he do for the Detroit community again I must’ve missed it
Lock them up
Danger can be right there in your face just have to open your eyes may you rest in peace
Mr. Hutchinson and his family went to my church when I still lived down state. His wife gave me rides home from Saginaw when I went to school there, and their neice was in my class. I can't believe Mrs. Hutchinson was in the car!! I'm so so sorry this happened.
No photo of shooter? Why not? Oh!
Babytron stay shouting him out in songs r.i.p🙏🏽🕊
Hutch was 9 times out of 10 on some police shit
Keep fucking with these people.
RIP
no description or name of perp?
No surprise another involved member of the rap hip hop culture is taken out.
Why do people smile while being interviewed regarding tragedy…….!?  I just don’t get it.
He done some fake 💎 to.some.seroius people !!! Rest in Power DJ Kay
Too Up close and Personal!!!😈😠somebody "Hated" this Katt...Why??? Leave a Wit-Ness???...that many Shot's in the Window???...Feels like a "Hit" made to Lo'o'k like a Random Robbery that Man seems like He was Set Up Whoever it was they seen 👀 👀 👀 his Every Move it Feels Planned???...R.I.P Boss Man from the Killer's Jealous Hearted ❤ Envy Minded....."H@ter's" the "Truth" will be "Revealed"...
Why let him do it when we can.
Getting a.chain is important?  Wow
Well they didn't say It was a robbery...I'm sure if they caught the suspect shortly after they would have found evidence of a robbery.  Somebody wanted him dead. Ijs
Sad.
I hate when people smile talking about someone that passed🤬😤🤬
"Everybody is surprised."  Then the only thing I can say is everybody must be stupid. Are you kidding, it's Detroit.
I doubt If the fat dude ran anywhere 😂my condolences
Hutch involved in Police 👮‍♂️ investigations with street drug dealers…..It’s the Cops 👮‍♂️ fault for pressuring him into Cooperating💯
Three words when put together will definitely get you killed! Detroit + Hiphop + Jeweler, not a good combination indeed!
The wife is in on it.
MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, IT HURTS US ALL ACROSS THE WORLD WHEN ANYONE LOOSES ANYBODY. MAY GOD GIVES YOU PEACE THAT SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING FROM YOLANDA BRADFORD IN HOUSTON TEXAS
Damn.
This is beginning to be bullshit! Can’t go to school, can’t go to work, can’t go church, or ride down the street you will be shot and killed!
Did he sell someone fake diamonds or something?
“Hutch Did Da Chain” smh Rip Hutch 🙏🏽
no eminem ..........move on
why is that dirty wanbe rapper smiling
Look at the wife
Man thats lame as hell
Horrible! Our daily violence is out of control. Sadly he is our 18,182 soul laid to rest in 2022. In only 152 days. That's 33,378 shootings. 233 Mass. And 2465 which involved children. Sadly these are just gun violence. This doesn't include all the other ways our american are being taken. 1 beautiful human soul dies every 10 minutes due to gun violence. With every other way people are being killed it's more 1 every 5 minutes.
Humans are just evil.
That's what happens when you p*** off the wrong m***********
🙏 this shit gotta stop
We must find the group of radical white men who did this.
Nine bullet holes in the drivers side door glass.  Nine!  Can't tell if those nine were shot into or out of the truck though.
Why didn't he just submit 😕
No description of the shooter?
White people still live there? lol
Selling overpriced junk jewelry to men who grew up without their fathers and rap off beat had something to do with this.  My guess he pissed off the wrong customer. Or something he was involved in more sinister and organized.
May he rest in peace my condolences to his family and friends
Who did he piss off?.
Dam never got the chance to get my pair of buffs from hutch!
Fucked up
Unfortunate from monster and loser
Let me get it he made more money than you...wtf👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿😡😡😡😡😡... I never heard of the guy.but that's fuked up.this man built a empire now look wat happens...bs
Glad they caught the suspect. Now when it's found guilty..take it out back and put a bullet in it's head. No need for jail.
RIP
Those evil white supremacists, I swear they are out of control in this country. LMFAO at you people.
Protect yourselves and your people especially today! Think just a little bit dummies!
Rip I seen 9 holes in that window  Looks personal to me
Surround yourself with criminal thugs and this is what happens. Make better life choices. Any guesses on the suspect description?   “When youz git youz some munnyz U gotta spenn it on chainz n jordanz”
Whoever did this is good as dead rest easy king
Set up these rappers knew his moves ....
I counted 9 bullets holes in the driver side window. That was either real hate or a hit. I hope he rests in peace 😢
I can’t stand broke hating as peasants.
💔
It's Detroit, nuff said.
A true Detroit Legend 🙏🏾💪🏾
Success used to be the American dream, now it's just something a bunch of useless losers / haters are waiting to kill and rob you for when you get out of work. There's going to be a point where we have to choose: who is worth rearranging this entire country to accommodate? The people who are trying to make society progress and work despite our shortcomings in the past as a whole, or the animals that continually and senselessly attack people in our schools and on the streets just because they had earned more or had different color skin. These adult babies and babies that want to pretend they're adults (and mostly uneducated racists) are hiding behind the mental health crisis, making a negative stigma for people that actually could use help. So I hope all these criminals out there doing ratty things like this live hard unrewarding lives and lose the scraps they steal to people just like them so they can see just how big of a stain on society they actually are. They aren't cool, it isn't funny, these people constantly attacking randoms on the street and messing with kids need to go.
Wow, sometimes you just never know where or when eh?
Sending my condolences.. I heard of them through Baby Tron a Detroit rapper
All that money he didn't invest in a bullet proof truck?🤔
This is Crazy Mad People keep on killing take people from their family
Wearing all tht gold they become targets.
every single day that possibility of an armed robbery or a disgruntled pawn customer committing violence had to be ever present..........a bulletproof vest and pistol would be constant in public if it was me...especially in that business
Yall killing the guys that help yall fraud smh never mind the hand that feeds u
We have a character crises in this shot out nation.our leaders are killing thousands in wars and they wonder why this happens. Called fucking karma. Pray for this nation. Only God can help us.
A lot of dirty money in the jewelry game.If you know you know!!!
Had to hit golden sun then I'm goin to hutch next!!!  😥 R.i.p
Rule #1 don't ever start a business in the hood unless you got tanks machine guns grenades full body armor suit bullet proof Helmet. Should be aight then
I do know he was helping the cops with a PPP loan scam investigation.
This is horrible to hear
Thats why you cant do business with blk ppl smh. All they gone do is try to befriend you then they gone get jealous and snake you. Thats why ion fuk with’em.
Lord please have mercy 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Condolences 🙏🏽
My condolences go to the family and community 🙏 😢.   From Philadelphia!!
He was doing business with the wrong crowd...
Stop the violence
Smh
Maybe his wife set him up
Someone he knew.
Dammmmn
Now the perpetrator will get locked up, receive benefits, three gourmet meals daily, free medical, legal aid, make new friends, job skill class, etc etc etc while the victim’s family gets nothing.
Lando why the fuck are you smiling bro
Shit sound like it was personal
Damn babytron refrenced hutch a lot never knew about him before then either way its a sad day for Detroit
His work will be worth even more now that he's gone. RIP
I've done work for him and his family over the years as a handyman sad day sorry for the loss to the family
Smh people can’t even work a job, trash
I wonder how many people gunna die over this hahaha
Why live in that sewer?
What does the suspect look like?
Def a hit!! Smh
Sad either way, but he's probably very well insured. Start with the wife. 😏
9 upperbody  Shots Crazy  R.I.P.
Gang gang
WHY?
Why didn't they identify the "suspect"?
A pawn shop owner shot... who would have seen that one coming
This was dirty, this was personal, and I'm wondering how his wife did not get hit???  Someone needs to talk to his wife...
Hutch paid the price for living around turd molasses people.
Them shots was clean. 🤔 HIT….
He may have been the man, but somebody wanted him dead.  And there's someone who knows who it is.  I'm sorry, but there are too many bullet holes in that window...
RIP DAN 🙏🏽
Lots of Blacks in that area ....Oh My !!!
Dang, not even Hutch was safe from being sacrificed for Reparations to Black people.
Oh my God !!!  Too dangerous in USA !!!  Lots of killings EVERYWHERE !!!
Until WE stop the MONSTERS that supply the guns, we will ALL CRY!
It's scary living near certain people these days.
Demons hateing
Gotta look into the wife
Condolences To The Family & Friends
Pawn shop was closed Tuesday.
Thoughts and prayers won’t stop killings. Banning guns will.
Criminal first instead of hard working good people, people need to protest this horror
People with gun violence should be automatic death penalty
Got money for chains but not for child support 👍👍👍
This ticks me off...I hope they find the person who did this...wtf wanna kill hutch? Come on dawg...I got most of my jewelry from there ...I hope that 🦝 gets life ...upsets me. Hutch was a staple and some idiot had to ruin it...
Looks sounds like organized crime hit
HIS WIFE LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE
Liberal cities. Democrat cities.
setup.
Get ready for riots and looting. bIm will protest and demand justice, right?
Nobody knows these people but RIP
So y'all put a goofy guy up there with jewelry on talking crazy and smiling 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡💩

Wow!!  The more you defend Tha City the more it makes you wonder why!? It's supposed to be DETROIT VS EVERYBODY!  Not DETROIT VS DETROIT!! smh RIP BIGG HUTCH
Bananas... When people speak positive about you in your absence that's real talk RIP Mr. Hutch
Why is goofy smilin while talkin about the situation as if somethin funny😒
It was 8 or 9 holes in the driver side window and 5 or 6 in the windshield, looks like a hit🤔 RIP TO Hutch Mane 🙏🏽👑
Hood logic if you making it and someone finds out.You best believe someone is coming to take it away from you.
When dude said "when you get you a check" more like when you make non taxed money brother
Im sure he had armed security at the store locations but shocked he didn't have a CCW
People be so jealous
They ain't take no money from him this wasnt personal this was a hit and the hitman got caught smh didn't even get to spend the money
When you think the City got Love for you! They don’t
All that money he should of been having bullet proof everything
Look at the bullet holes in the glass. Looks like a professional hit or a real good shooter. Where was the wife sitting?? This wasn't a robbery. I'm just saying
That was a pro hit 😮wow
I'm thinking this was at American Jewelry And Loan.. Pawn Stars t.v. show.. I'm sorry for the confusion.. And my Deepest Sympathy to the Family..
R.I.P. my condolences to his family and friends 🙁
Wife set him up.
Hutch was known by everyone in Detroit as a snitch. He has helped put away a lot of guys.   Hutch got what the streets can bring.
You know t grizzly mad af
Never heard of  any of them...R.I.P.
Of course you’re not going to talk about the suspect, but we all know what he looks like.
damn rip hutch 🙏🏿🕊🤲🏿
Oh oh a hip hop jeweller in a big fancy car was killed, seems like we have a mystery to solve...Scooby doo where are you??

Rip hutch the Detroit Jacob the 💎
Man this shit crazy
When you wear that crap you are saying: "Please kill me and take this $50,000 off my neck.
Detroit so terrible  that's a real bad look for detroit
Well you choose who you deal with...
Damn
Niggas gotta start treating each other better dude… RIP
Ninjas gone crazy....and nothing happens to them
Wow... The way the window looked. It is very surprising that his wife didn't get hit. My God!...🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️
This is why people don’t wanna open any businesses in these areas and I can’t blame them.
Jealous and envy is real so sad
Wife was there but unharmed. Approached him as he was walking to his car but shots were fired INTO the car? What type of reporting is this. May this man Rest In Peace. I’m glad they caught the worthless POS.
Jealous punk ass thugs.
R.i.p. hutch I remember me and my bro used to go to the one at the mall all the time
i saw this brother on the net and he say he was lucky to win 10 thousand dollar and then bought himself a 7 thousand dollar chain and then gets rob for it ,lol
Seriously why does anyone live in Detroit!!!!!????? Rip Sir I'm sure you did not deserve that!
SHEESH
Rip hutch
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 RIP Hutch
Counted at least a minimum of nine bullet holes on his windshield. His wife was probably sitting in the backseat or she'd be dead too. What  the hell is really going on
Bruh smiling the whoe time.
so sad god bless
Fairly good grouping
Probably jealousy
Sounds like an inside job.
Cnt wait to see the goofy who this
All that money and can't even buy a bulletproof window, if i had that level of money my car would've had plates and everything on the doors.
That was a hit. Hope they find out y he killed him. Bet he was paid to kill Dan. The bullet holes tell you it was a targeted hit
A mf can't have shit without someone lurking on you hating. R.I.Paradise my condolences to his family and real friends 🙏🏽 🙌🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽💔
So very sad prayers for his family and friends
Someone was angry. Nine shots through the drivers' window? Someone wanted him dead.
This is super sad.  I never heard of him before this but he sound like he was the man, and well liked.
I do not live where this happened, but I am just curious as to how his SUV got shot up 9 times but his wife was not injured or killed? How does that happen? Would she not be able to identify as well as testify against the suspect? Make this make sense please? I mean was she sitting in the back seat or something?
He's still "rapping" his head around this.
The motive is BLM duh!
Damn that's fucked up
Selling that BS diamonds
“When you get you some money you go get you a lil chain or sum, it’s important” no it really isn’t. What is important is investing your money to create generational wealth. All a chain does is hang around your neck, RIP to that man and condolences to his family.
Just sad and senseless! Makes no sense... God we need you 🙏  the world needs you 🙏 sweet Jesus please hear the cry!
Big man don't look too sad
His wife wasn't injured, maybe she wanted the business and life insurance, or he got someone for a lotta money with fake jewelry
It’s..its..it’s …its like smh
So sorry for your senseless tragic loss! Where was his security ??
Pew pew pew
They caught that fool good
The fuck is wrong with this World
This is why if you making money , you can’t be in the hood point blank period smh
They hit this man 9 times!! Smh!!!
I would say a train shooter look at the shots in the window
Damn hutch
At least have a pic for us out of towners 🤦🏾‍♂️
Wack af mane bad ass kids fry them!
Sad I bet thy was blk thy knowing for doing shit and killing thy own
He must of played with the wrong person
This is crazy
Hip hop jewelry lol. Try black gang culture jewelry.  Looks like someone figured out they bought costume jewelry.
So unfortunate & what a major lost …. Pray for his family 🙏🏾… keeping business in the city you make wealth in … unfortunately  you just can’t anymore ….
Yeah, when you get some money, the first thing you want to do is get a  chain.
A lot of stolen stuff is laundered in pawn shots and its owners now it and accept it.  **************************************************************************************
They took that man away from his family for nothing smh
Sending condolences and prayers to the family and friends 🙏. However the person the police caught that did this was a crash test dummy and he will reveal the truth or sum 1 will give him a nap before he speaks the truth. This is a lesson for any one ppl will hate on your presence and despise your financial gain and want death to come u just because they will never be able to hold your weight you control. Maybe not today nor tomorrow but the truth will speak from those weak lips who want his life or someone in it.
Always be alert. Be armed. Rip
Find the scumbags loser's put them away for life
Damn not Dan. I've never been to his shop but Detroit rappers bring him up all the time. May Allah cover his loved ones and wel8him into Jannah 🙌🏿
He should've bulletproofed his car!!
😢 ❤️❤️❤️👑
Did this Arab give back to the community that he was taking from ?? People die every day B " in my Cam'ron voice
You probably sold somebody a fake chain and they got back at them
🥀
Sounds like a hater or a hit to me
😢🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I hope this a bad dream and he wakes up singing my song
9 shots to the window. Definitely seems like someone wanted him dead and not a simple robbery
Why would you do cpr on a person with gun shot wounds they help kill him
I will say the fbi knows something. You dont make hip hop jewelry (that isnt cheap) and not come across them once or twice. It just takes a lot of coint.
Yes.... This is what Dr King died for. Ridiculous jewelry.
Word in da city that the reason he got popped cuz the feds was looking into his business because of all the purchases from scammers over 10k wasn’t reported to the irs so they say they had to get em so he won’t tell…smh
“Hutch did the chain!!!” 🥲
Damn they dont care who they take out. Even the good people they actually need get hit.  check on each other no matter medical needs. Even those people seemingly outsiders need to checked on. It might be you that prevents another catastrophy. 🙏
Someone mad cuz they couldn't gt a deal. watch and see.
Damn not hutch that’s crazy rip 🤲🏾
All you have to do is look for those people
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thats what happens when you associate yourself with thugs .
*DAMN shame..... SMH*
Not hutch!!! Dam thats crazy
May he rest in peace God rest his soul for real
Unfortunately it was probably someone close to him that did him dirty
Why they didnt kill da wife all dem bullet holes? Looks like a set up yo
Dude take your business and leave this ghetto city
Greenfield sucks
Envious M/F's ..... R.I.P 🙏🙏
You lie down with dogs, and you get fleas. 🪲🐶
Probably was a bad deal
God be with his family
Crabs in a bucket.     .................GRIM
My heart goes out to his family that and friends. He seems to be loved by his family and friends. RIP sir 🙏🙏🙏
this is realy sad selling expensive custom jewelry in one of the countries most violent and poorest citys seems like a recipe for disaster.
Dang is it full moon? Shootings happening everywhere seemingly.
Let me guess, it was a racist white skin head.
wth
Hutch was MOST DEF a Staple in the Detroit HipHop Community. Rest Up To Him.
Wow for no reason. And got caught lmao
RIP Hutch  Most likely killed by his own people
Come on now it's 2022 you know how this game go
This was a set up
Nigga got lit up
Bullet proof it and tool up, Rip thugs are running rampant.
Bunch of savages
His unharmed wife is the culprit 🤔
My Condolences
I just dont get how people with money dont ride in bullet proof vehicles. 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
People gotta understand.. when Children are being shot. You name in the hood or if your living in the Suburbs. Everyones a target
Local Legend
They killed hutch
Leave that rap world alone, y'all.
That’s a Hit. Facts
😥
Life is so precious; guys you can’t just keep taking lives…….   RIP
So sad.....it's always the same jealous hearted and hateful mean spirited group, keeping up the most mess...tired of it🤞🏾
My condolences to the family of Detroit hip-hop jeweler Daniel "Hutch" Hutchinson.  #GoneButNeverForgotten 🕊
Tell u what whoever did that is cooked af 😂😂 whole city gonna be on yo ass that’s their jeweler.. and tell u what, them cops are going to investigate a rich white mans death 100%… have fun getting fucked in the ass for the next 25-L 😂😂
Shooting scene looks fishy. Look like a paid hit. And from the rumors around here in Detroit this dude. Never mind I'm a keep my mouth closed
Brothers killing Brother is a tragedy.
Repent Israelites all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🙏🏽  Amos 3:6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?  Deuteronomy 32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.  Luke 13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
He did absolutely nothing but gave a business and got followed and gunned down . We have to do better .. they didn’t show the suspect but I bet he black . And I’m black I just know
Killin over some baubles? Woman involved?
To be sincerely honest... in my humble opinion, articulating succinctly and without a hidden agenda, visions of grandeur, ulterior motives, sentimentalism, sarcasm, becoming nostalgic or disingenuous and of course, without offending anyone who holds views  contrary to my own, and without burying any impure thoughts within my subconscious and without lies or deception, to the actual truth with my clear open mind and loyal loving heart, expressing whatever has been embedded inside me for a long time which I didn't share with others because I was petrified of doing so, is about to be revealed without myself becoming a slave to fear and/or a co-signee of preposterous political correctness. Today, by gathering all the courage and motivation I could muster, I just want to state the fact that I actually feel and think that I have absolutely nothing prophetic, inspirational or even remotely interesting to say.
Somebody paid Somebody 🤦🏽‍♀️🙏🏿 RIP
Looks like a gang hit to me... No robbery just a bunch of shots through the window...  Hey FOX news why are you glorifying gang violence and giving shout outs to local gangster rappers???
So sad
"Hutch did the chain!.....and the ice in the frames"  That hutch?
Damn just the name Hutch was legendary in the bars bro it was soundin like if it wasnt Hutch or a few others then you wasn't official lol Rest in Power Hutch keep shinin on em✊🏾🙏🏾
Condolences. But who else didnt even know the rappers mentioned. Brimbo baby, Deceptigon, Lil Smurf 😲
Wish they showed a picture never heard of him..actually build a name here..sad
My Sincerest Condolences to The Family During this Time 💝
