Water guns as evidence, blacks can fk up a wet dream
"I feared for my life."
I think we need more guns in this country
Im not supprised at all to see the usual suspect. Same color, nappy looking head, and brainless activity as always.😢
Weakness is the ability to control your emotions and serving that self you have fed instead of rebuking self. Idiots.
Idiot
Why they even at the school after graduating
Learn how you’re responsible for your own safety, new book called Dealing with Burglary and Home Invasion Robbery.  Includes street crime.
Your big meeting will not help at all! yuor just fooling your self!
You'll never hear about something like this outside the ghettos. How many guns were found and how many of them have been acquired illegally??
the gang bangers were jealous of them
the usual suspects
Looks like practice for the real thing, when we were young we all did this but just never had the need to shoot each other, these kids are not raised right.
Who would ever guess that would happen…..🧐
Ya can’t say what you want about this.
What a lovely culture.
Imagine being so disrespectful to the community you have water gun fight in a public parking lot and spraying water at random strangers.
What a dumbass
What a bunch of bullies. They were probably jealous cuz the kids were having a good time. Bullies make me sick 🤢🤮
So the squirt guns had nothing to do with the fight... then say that, don't click bait a tragey like this.
The news reporter trynna look all sexy
Its always their kind
Tupac didn't teach his disciples to back down from no super soaker. These guys are hip hop all stars living the life taught to them by their hip hop heroes!
BLM? at least this killing was for more than a chicken sandwich or some condiments.
2 years ago, i bet this still happens. lololol
Approximate US population, as of 2021: 340 million people.  Approximate amount of guns in the US, as of 2021: 435 million.  DO THE MATH!!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Well that escelated quickly....
Our senior prank was a massive water balloon fight on the football field we had thousands and thousands of water balloons everyone in my senior class filled up a cooler full per person and we placed the 260 coolers of water balloons on football field and all the seniors took off running at 10 am tonthe football gield out of class teachers followed cause it was weitd and then all hell broke loose water balloons went everywhere and teachers principal and all got into the fun anf the principal said thank you this was the most amazing and fun senior prank ever we had tons of water balloons where the football field you vouldnt see the green kf the field from all the balloon pieces we cleaned the gield afterwards as well with lawnmowers with baggers
the reason shots were fired was because the water guns looks exactly like a real gun
Typical resort to violence
13-54...
N in their  Violent
Well well well, All the videos to the right have one thing in common
Names like Dekwone? Now I know why these things happen.
Look at the usual suspects
That news reporters RBF kicked in heavy my god
How to say, "Im a witch", without saying you're a witch. Poor kid, hope the killer gets locked in G-Pod.
how many decades do we have to keep tolerating these fucking animals? lets ship them back now!!!!!
Can’t make the park safe when cockroaches can drop by and kill peoples during a water gun contest.
This is why we can't have nice things. Now they'll ban water 🔫 guns too. So sad.😢
Was this on Juneteenth after a George Floyd statue unveiling on MLK boulevard?
Can't even have a water fight. Do African American's have the the most weak mentally? Why they always get offended over nothing and escalate situations irrationally
Man brought the wrong gun 💀
😂 So sad that teens can’t get together, and have innocent fun without someone ruining it for everyone!!  And,G most importantly, a young life was taken over nonsense!!!   PLEASE STEP UP ,AND BE THE SOLUTION INSTEAD OF THE PROBLEM BY SETTING AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS! TREAT OTHERS HOW YOU WANT THEM TO TREAT YOU, 😃 CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES WISELY.  DISMISS WORDS, BC STICKS & STONES CAN BREAK YOUR BONES,  BUT BULLETS KILL!  SO, UNDERSTAND THAT WORDS ARE HARMLESS UNLESS YOU GIVE THOSE WORDS PERMISSION TO HURT YOU!! YOUR INTEGRITY COMES FROM YOUR DECISIONS & ACTIONS,  YOUR TIME ON EARTH IS SHORT AT ITS LONGEST POINT, SO MAKE EVERY MOMENT COUNT!
thats the youth we have running robbing killing and stealing there way to the top... were teens have machine guns and think its GTAV...so proud of this America
kid ruined his life cause he didnt want to get wet...
How does a water gun turn into real guns
The most escalated it could get a year ago was someone pulling up with either a nerf gun or a hose
That's sussy
Water gun to real gun ? No he was definitely thinking cause ain’t no way it went from water to bullets
DAMN !!!  they keep killing each other their ain't gonna be any blacks left
Blackies "having fun" - episode 18875783673634 - to be continued...
Common factor? Yeah definitely!
So sad America cant fight with there hands.
Don't bring a water gun to a real gun fight.
typical
its always the same people.. i said it,.
It's great to have a well regulated militia...
Why did that group have to mess things up...damn, that was soooo frustrating to watch. Why wasn't he in college...work...or somewhere. Why were they around those students.....why do you feel the need to hate on these kids. Damn....makes no sense.
coward punk
some people say USA is the best country in the world 🤣🤣🤣
".....Is anyone gonna Go Ahead,  and Say it?.........a fucking 'Water' fight.........and eventually......... They can't keep from swappin' out,  with their 'Real Thug-Iron?......... Good god...........
hahahahhahahhhahaahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahah  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The stance of the shooter in that freeze frame will never not be the trademark execution pose of an uncivilized killer. Prancing around, arms at constant shoulder height, shooting one-handed - it's such an unmistakable body language of someone who has little to nothing left in their soul but evil. They know what they're doing, and they're doing it with utter glee, which makes it even more disgusting to think about. If you're at an age where you're making such a deplorable act deliberately, you no longer have any excuses.
Usually is the neighbors that do this
ofc the blacks came from the basketball court and immediately started beef for absolutely nothing
Did LeBron issue a statement afterwards condemning the shootings?
Guns are for killing people. Use a gun to commit ANY crime, death penalty. There's just no other way.
They are all cowards, afraid of a fair fight.  They will never know the satisfaction of winning (or losing) a fight, man to man, because they are punks.  They always need an advantage in numbers or weapons.
And one if them is Typical
Only two words
Why are blacks like this?
I know how you can make the park safer...
water guns and real guns both make people wet.
A bunch of blacks shooting each other. What a shock !!!!
This is so sad his family will never forget this  Rip senior
LOLOLOLOL .. dumb and stupid different color folks can't stop running from each other  lol
coward couldnt just go punch him out if he didnt like it
a group of feral children were having fun with a water fight and then along comes the lone crusader to mess things up. Good yob skippy
Stupid people!!
The Zulu Nation practicing Conflict Resolution the only way they know how. What a disgusting breed.
Blacks can literally escalate anything into a deadly shootout. You know they’ll die about they respekt!!! It’s shameful their lives and so called self respect is actually that much lower than all other races.
water water
Low life
But he was a goot boy, we need to put these rabid fogs down...
Just let them keep doing this to their own people. 😂
monkey conflicts are very predictable!
Wonder if that gun was legally registered 🤔
Of course they are _________.  You figure it out.
Haha
never go on a "water gun fight" in america, someone... will come with a real gun on purpose or mixed up a real gun with his water gun
Frm cold water to Hotlead, deadly cocktail that surely cnt b mixed😢😢
you know what it is, blacks of course
Why arent children outside anymore??? - because.
Send them back to the jungle
nothing good happens when you put a basketball court up in any area. There is a certain attitude and MO associated when any HOA or neighborhood installs basketball in any area
That's why parents shouldn't allow their children to associate with this.....segment of society. Let them kill amongst themselves.
Only in America can a water gun fight turn into a real gun fight.....
🙄 uncivilised rats 🐀
Only in the US..
What could possibly be the common denominator here?🤔 6% of the population equals 50% of the crime according to the democratically run FBI
goddam modern day apes
u.s.a. who wants to friggin live there the wild west is getting wilder bunch of cowards using weapons too easy
No self-control. Cage .
WOW! So even water can be deadly at high speed.
damn that's was low IQ and coward asf
THE KILLER HAD TO BE EXECUTED ASAP SO TO WARN OTHERS IF THE AUTHORITY DON'T ACT MOST LIKELY THOSE THAT NO SUPPOSE TO DIED MIGHT BE THE NEXT VICTIMS.
Of course they are "shirtless" LOLOLOLOL
Not even close to being surprised 🤦‍♂️ 😢
This is what happens when every idiot owns a gun.
poor security, a gun was inside the school and was used to kill, they should be stricter on people like that, what most people who went to school know is the student's second house, how could the gun be inside the school and the boy used it, the world is really different if the Your child is safe even if they have an accident 🤦‍♂️🤦🤦‍♀️
how a water gun fight be deadly? trppin
I opened this video thinking it was those pistol water guns that look real, like a beretta. Color me shocked when it was clear that they were regular water guns, and they still got shot by a thug.
What led up to the violence YT won't kei me say.
Blacks !!
lol America
Cowards always shooting
I saw this as a meme... I didn't  know it actually happened!
Those kids that had real guns are animals. Mess everything up
Only in the US
Color man.. again
13% of population - 65% of VIOLENT crime and rising
They cant do nothing without violence
Always the same group responsible.
Basketball American moment
only in America !
GOOD MORNING USA, I GOT A FEELING THAT IT'S GONNA BE A WONDERFUL DAY! **Gets shot for playing with squirt guns**
Dude must like the prison life.
Hey guys, I'm not from America, and even though I can understand why you want the freedom to own guns, I think your country is moving in a very dangerous direction. Anyone could have a weapon, and anyone could shoot you on the spot. You should enact different laws to regulate the purchase of firearms.
Even a simple water gun game turns deadly with these people !  And you wonder why people don’t want to be around them
I love the racial diversity in these two groups.
Get rid of all those high powered water guns. Look at what they are doing to our children. The mother of that thug will say " he's a good boy, never been in much trouble". His defence will be " will they pointed a gun at me". I wonder if he had a permit for that gun? What store did he buy it at? They should be in trouble to. That's right, he didn't get it at a gun store
Why not make guns illegal? Why does your right to freedom trump one's right to live.
America is hilarious
Who cares. Let em off each other. No news here. Old if anything.
when you can't defend yourself ....you buy a gun
Darwin approves this post.
Death penalty? Hes on video.
Where’s BLM at?
God these inbred animals can’t even have FUN without turning deadly.  Frieza was right.
ohh  LINCOLN
Imagine being so butthurt and mad about water that  you fucking murder somebody. God help this country...
Common denominator is.....
This never happens in countries with gun control... but solution must be more guns right? If the victim had a gun this wouldnt have happened right? So lets arm everyone and their grandma and all will be safe
😐🤷‍♂️I will stay in Canada 🇨🇦 less dangerous when we play water 🎈 ballon
When someone keeps squirting you in the face…
It is normal it is 🇺🇸💔💔💔💔💔👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼)((Holland Limburg)
This is why we needed capital punishment for every intentional murder
Blacks can't even have a water fight get the hell away from them.
In my country kids can have fun playing outside without getting shot. I know that's hard to imagine.
that's.  AMERICA
Gringos 🤙🏻
Good old American gun laws 😂 still like the wild west
These people should suffer  and continue suffering even if they want death. They shouldn't be allowed to die.
Pulling a gun and killing someone no matter if it´s over water balloons or some other more "real" drama/beef and taking you own future away, your victims future away, possibly you own familys well being away and the victims family and friends.... Is about as stupid as winning a billion on the lottery and really wanting some chewing gum and trading the ticket for it. The proportional gains is about as equal.
Only in America
Naggers..
Blacks.
Why do cars have more regulations than guns?!! Clearly, guns need educating on, because no one is taking that power seriously at all.
Minority 🙄
hey look at that! yet ANOTHER dinndu.
They can’t do anything without having a shootout
13%
So sad 😢
Im tired of niggas
Biden voters sure keep themselves occupied.
People? These are 🐒
O look...the usual suspects
This is what happens every time Norwegians have a party, they just love to keep that stereotype alive
Assault Water guns need to be banned !!!!
To be fair they did put urine in their water pistols
Its insane that kids and teens in America Can use Guns
le cancer des étas unis
Atlanta.
Usual suspects, if you know what I mean.
Songkran would be a better option.
Lol
even the smallest thing drives them to violence.
They look strikingly like packs of animals.
Dude is such a gangster that he got so mad that he lost a eater gun fight that he actually killed the person he lost to.  What an absolute moron. Rot in prison
little advice making it safer long live penalty for everyone from this basketball field + get their families also in jail for failing raising their kids. whole neighberhood cleared for a generation.
The shooting has as much to do with the water gun fight as it does the basketball game... nothing.  This was just two groups of idiots idiotically defending their fragile street pride.  Nice click bait.  You got me.
nek minute, cops: he's got a super soaker, pew pew pew pew
Ethnic crime is rapidly on the rise.
georgia is one of the nastiest states, there are so many of THEM!  it is always THEM! NASTY!
USA…
Stop resistance
Insecure thugs can’t stand seeing their own people enjoy themselves. What a sad community
When I was a kid instead of water gun we used pellet guns and going shirtless and just sun glasses for defense.
It's normal in that kind of "community"
An argument in a parking lot. One dead. The other going to prison - probably for life. Hope it was worth it.
Only in America would a playful water fight trigger someone’s ego and cause them to kill.
weird this stuff doesn't happen in Australia... wonder why
Kid pulled out a Super Soaker 5000 and buddy felt threatened so had to reach for the strap.
Don't bring a water gun to a real gun fight.
American trinity: entertainment, guns, and freedom
Give guns in the hands of kids and then wonder & investigate why they pulled the trigger. So stupid.
What a shame
in my counry . we dont have cases like this , bcuz we dont have  guns here . simple
this lil monkey thinks that now he is tough or something while ruining his life over silly thing. but that's okay coz monkeys belong to cages best place for them
blud got hit one to many times with the water💀
any pattern?
It's almost like current culture embraces this...
Ooga
man these basketball americans are violent
⚫⚫
What a pathetic.... Thing. Cant call something like that a person. Shooting someone over a little water. Damn.
So where's the entire video?
Can't even have fun with water guns anymore, yep, this is the petty world we live in now. I need to go watch videos that restore my faith in humanity to make myself feel better about the unbelievable cesspool of toxicity we live in.
kids don't know how to have good old fashion fun anymore.
Stereotypes exist for a reason…
highest quality security camera
Bunch of little boys without daddies that grow up physically but not emotionally.
Looks like Ja Morant's future
Only in America...
Brain dead , dead eyed soulless jogger
He won't collect that Nobel Prize, shame
Somebody gotta tell BLK ppl  Blk Lives Matter…
Those 13 52s at it again...
Lol
Well its in their blood 🤣
Parents are to blame for these idiots animal kids.
at least he didnt get caught lackin bro clutching the water gun
When you're having a fun, safe water gun fight, but then someone uses a melee attack.
Way to ruin people having fun. GOOD FLIPPING JOB. At least he did a right thing turning himself in
We all know how violent us Americans are. Imagine something like the water festival in Thailand happening in America? Geez we are so screwed up in the head.
This world is fucked....
Just straight up dumb. Senseless selfish acts of ignerdumb.
I smell freedom
Thugs gonna be thugs smh
Murica moment
You know everything is messed up when some random dude's brain goes haywire and shoots a bunch of  high-schoolers for no reason, bro even if you pay millions I wouldn't want to be in America rn
Only in america
ONLY HAPPENS IN USA RIP
TYPICAL
Typical
Once again, an example of the usual suspects behaving as they usually do.
THIS IS ... AMERICAAAAAA. Too much cow boys in the far east. 🙃
America ?
Good
Just hang him 😒 bc
We need looser gun laws. None of this would have happened if everybody was allowed to carry machine guns and grenades
Where’s the outrage from BLM
Bruh brought hard water
the greatest nation on earth that allows citizen to bear arms so why is it news if they started shooting.  what else are you gonna do if you are allowed to bear arns.?
animals
Weird, 13% commiting over 63% of crime.
Zoo animals that nobody would pay to look at
So no one is gonna mention the fact he did this in front of 20 witnesses too? what a moron, hope he never goes out of jail..
Only in the hood
Looks like the congo
is this like the onion or is this serious?
So much tribalism in the comments. You people can't even see how your being played. A fellow human being was murdered and all anyone here can say is "us vs them".
I don't get it what is so "brave" about shooting at somebody. In the old times, even if you had a problem with somebody, you called him out for duel or something to prove who is better even if it was pistol duel. These cowards think the gun makes them invincible and they can do whatever they want.
Man really upgraded his gun.
Americans... Lol
Lol yes America, what do the world even expects right? Nothing new moving on
There is no value of human life with alot of people anymore.  Others and their own.
13%
this is completely normal for BLM don't be surprised
Great nation they say
wow these 'illegals' are fkg up the whole country..lmfao

Wrong gun Bruuh..
imagine being that stupid like holy it's doing everything you obviously shouldn't do, I can't even comprehend that
Has anyone noticed the AI generated ads with fake celebrity endorsements, WTF!?
Always the same people
Only pussies pull guns in a fistfight, little pussies with daddy issues, papa pounded the shooter in the ass too hard too many times, now he has to relive that in prison for the rest of his life
Future doctors and lawyers right there. Them kia boys ans such....
This world never will be safe with these people of color shooting everyone they want
Life Without Parole. Justice served. An animal caged for life.
Even though it happened in Fayette, the teens were from Clayton County. Tells me all I need to know. When you know you know!
BAN THE WATER GUNS !!!  Thoughts  and prayers  from Mar-a-lago  .
Only in America
Lol
many dark spots in the video...
This happens because idiots reproduce more idiots. Smh
BBT Basket Ball Thugs 😂
Either show the entire video or don't show any video. I disliked the clickbait!
It's in their genes.  Gots to kill.
None of this happens with high school students in Europe. Sick society.
Why do all your kids have guns in the first place ? 😳 USA is weird... -_-
must have been using the wrong water, they must have used tap water but bottled spring water would have saved the day,
Ja Morant is so excited after watching this
cultural enrichment they call it
blacks are  just special
so a nigga moment?
Not enough bananas to go around?
What a loser.
dang
Bro thought they were actually usinf real guns so he joined
you go america lmao you insane fools will never understand
Looks like the BLM movement is working!
This is amarica 😂
What a coward
they always act so though but without guns those gangs are little pussys
America
Who the hell linkin up to shoot water guns😂
Only in America...
Don't marry dark skin people
Bring back the death penalty and this will stop. We know it is not in your agenda to stop this so you can try to take everyone’s guns and banned firearms altogether, But it’s time
Nuke Fayette county. Problem solved
There is a fox to this stop fucking voting democrat
Democrat run city
Just fyi Sean Allen got life in prison Dec 2021. At least the judge wasn’t a wuss and let him out on bond to murder again.
He said " allegedly shot " 💀💀💀
Just cold blooded murder.
Man i thought from the day he was born his mamma told him to never bring a toy🔫 gun to a loving  family event.😂
He did it to get street cred , too bad all his impressed friends will forget his name  and move on without him ,not even putting something on his commissary to buy a bag of chips or a deck of cards.
Guns solve everything.hes happy with his desision and his new life .or he wouldn't have done it .he knows what police do to you when you shoot someone, and he did it anyway.
Another bully
This is flat murder, give no bond, life forever. No question and stop that allegedly stuff. He has the gun, premeditated, with malis aforethought (the intention to kill or harm, which is held to distinguish unlawful killing from murder.)
20 year olds beefing with high schoolers a serious sign of some one not maturing fast enough...
Cowards masquerading as tough guys. I feel bad for the kids looking to have some harmless, non-violent fun.
13% at it again
Only niggaz
Great culture
That's so fucking pathetic.
He dindu nuffin maaan
Dope culture yo
PUNKS
bro, what a shitty country
And how as a society are we supposed to take BLM seriously when this happens all the time???
Where are those kids fathers?
Would you have expected anything else.
Screw FOX, FOX YOU!
Merica
See actions like this is why we've just started our very first YouTube channel based on Georgia's Serial Killers because the way this is going we'll never run out of content.  Kinda like the local funeral homes
The Caption is confusing 😅, Water gun fight ends deadly 😳
They Will Let Him Go 😳 Within 24 Hours
its nerf or nothing
Nah 😂
its always basket ball people
Any gun is deadly even a potato gun 😭
Thay brought out the nurf guns
Quartering and everyone else who thinks he can play with lifes like this
Definitely going to be someone's bottom in prison 😂
Lock ‘‘em up Throw away the key Inform the parents that they raised a pos
This is normal ....
And is the park now safer 1 year later? soemhow i dont think so
It’s  interesting you can See how the gang is walking….. they’re following the devil. The thing is when you follow the devil, he already brought you DOWN & Now he wants you to Take it Out on Others….. The shooter wasn’t thinking of his future. The devil deceived him to believe he didn’t have one….. that’s why he trying to mess it up for other ppl who DO have a future….
This is just dumb. Should’ve never happened. Them kids were simply having a good time wit water guns and one kid ended up dead.
America and their guns....
how do you take it that personal that you have to actually harm someone else? R.I.P
Typical fatherless Democrats.
13/60     No surprise
Typical honestly
This is pathetic, they are all on video, they know who they are, they ALL need to face consequences !!!
Wonderful people
men with guns and ego
WTF is wrong with people?? Hopefully the shooter rots in prison but he will probably be let out in a day due to the soft on crime D.A. F*cking sad all the way around.
This is why you have multiple kids, you never know who they're gonna take from you because they have nothing of their own.... low lifes
If the term "bitch made" had a mascot, itd be that shooter.
America what ofcourse 😏
I guess blk lives don't matter
Fkn cowards
Give him life in jail
Imagine if guns weren’t so easy to get
Sounds like a joke but no this actually happened
water gun looks like a real gun it changes the story......
I'm sure a "dialogue" with the dogshit parents in the neighborhood will definitely help.
Id wanna do something like that👍
The enemy runs their minds, so quick to throw it all away, but for what? Theirs too many people like this in the world right now.
What a loser. He must have lost the fight and decided to take that young boys life.
"We investigated ourselves and found no wrong doing"
Its all fun and games until its all fun and gangs
Which country ?
Only in the US
Keeping the stereotype alive! SMH. Should change the name of this country to Divided People of America
Gunfire exchanged?? Does he mean actual guns vs water guns
Cancel all water gun fights - in areas where people can't behave like civilized people
Usual suspects
only dirty blacks could ruin a water Bollon fight if you have a chance like i did with no camaras head stomp one for fun :) he was crying like a little bitch saying he had a kid and i just stomped his brains out
Usual suspects just having fun....
Where's BLM? Dosen't matter right?
Dumb a$$ kids hope they give that punk life in prison
There's just too many guns on the streets
GEORGIA GAVE THEM FREEDOM AND THATS WHAT THEYRE HARVESTING FOR 100 Years
There is so much hate in the world! You can't even have fun playing with water!😡
Blacks on blacks doesn't faze BLM.
This had nothing to do with the water fight? Seem to be two groups in the same place
Privileged class strikes again. 90/10 rule. 10% of privileged class committing 90% of crime.
Impulse control issues?
It runs in the blood his daddy was a loser his granddaddy sorry and his great granddaddy was a hater it runs in the blood line.
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
Chaquan...? Cmon
Give the guy a break, we all know he’s innocent… it’s not his fault🙄
I used to ride round Monroe Louisiana (ya nigga it was me) as a kid and throw water balloons at people on the way into the club 😂 with my ppl, good times.
😢😢
Did he forget that murdering people will get him put locked up possibly for life? I don't understand
Wow, these people can’t even have a water fight without killing someone.
That lady is the hottest news anchor I've ever seen
You want to make places safe for everybody out in this world. Then our cops in our government need to pull their head out of their asses and declare war on all these dumb-ass gang bangerz out here. All of them they all got to go tell do it means to be a f****** human.
Should put a sign up
Man the actual high school students try to do something fun and innocent to enjoy life, and of course a washed up 20 year old who used to go there (probably primed out in highschool also) still trying to act tough and cool comes and ruins it. Same movie different title.
You can't let them do nothing.🤦
loser was embarrassed he shot himself in the foot
Total scum what a surprise
Cant do nothing fun nowadays lmfao
People really hate seeing other people happy
Why shoot him to only turn yourself in when you could have just turned away to begin with! I just don't get this.
And they wonder why they are over half the crime rate and get stereotyped. It’s not a stereotype if it’s true.
So our taxes go to cameras that record in 140p...great job.
Basketball Americans gotta chill
I remember a time when merica was safe it was called segregation 😂 I'm not calling for it I'm just remembering when it was safe.
Dumbest kids I ever seen mother in father’s fail there kids this what happens
Stop the cycle of stupidity. Think before acting.
He went and ruined his like over a water fight.
😂
The culture of idiocy strikes once again.
culture
Give him life in Prison with no possibility of parole . Those evil kids need to be taken out of society
Was washing my car when like 15 year old's sprayed me with water guns filled with some pretty hot water that's a bit hotter then what you get from the faucet when its turned to max. Quick call to law enforcement. They patrolled until they found the kids, Called me over so that  I could speak to the parents. I  struck a deal so that I wouldn't press any charges with them OR to inform the schools of their behavior. They get to wash my car with their water guns filled with soapy water and then I got to run over every single one of the water guns with my nice and clean car.
BLM?  I knew it was a BLM
Bro is not a gangsta he is dumb ass to just kill a nigga right there like that anyway at that time gangstas move in silence cowards make a scene
If they didn't ban the gel blasters this wouldn't have happened
Why hasn't the City Council at least required a license to buy and carry a water pistol or better yet, banned them.  Obviously this was the fault of the water pistols.
Gee... I wonder why this wasn't national news. Hmmm
Thats so stupid💀that's like somebody dying by someone else with a grenade for throwing a water balloon at them💀💀💀
Oh look who it is again 😒  This is why racism.
So sad.. you can't even have fun as a child anymore
Fuckin dummys....
Savages!
i watched videos similar to this for 3 hours on youtube, the fact that all videos happend in the us makes me not want to visit anytime soon
Is US really a country to live now🤔
Clearly it didn’t have anything to do with the water fight….
I hope his inmates violate him every day, every hour, and every minute of his life
Heck, when I was in High School, you could go out to the parking lot and it would be easier to count cars and trunks without a rifle or a shotgun in the rear window most had both. But nobody would be using them until after school and going hunting. We had plenty of fist fights but somebody would get a bloody nose or something else and that would end the fight. Then later we would all go hunting together as friends. That was that living here in Texas. We did not have any Police presence in our schools then either. We only had one shooting back then and that was a teacher committed  suicide and he was about to go to jail for being involved  with a young student.
Imagine being such a loser & failure in life, when kids are playing with water guns running around having fun. And you shoot the kid. People think their so tough shooting a gun at someone
BLM
Even though i live in Canada gun violence is still so scary.
It's so easy to load to load live ammunition in a super soaker. Could happen to anyone honestly.
It's only natural to bring your gun to a basketball game.
"Now yall sure you brought a water gun bro."   "Yeah bro, it's a water gun." "Yall ready though?"
Smh mfs be so weird
Literal murderous animal.
They're gonna have fun with that ponytail
its always the same. clock work orange
I fell down a YouTube rabbit hole, watching 6-7 videos like this one, showing senseless use of deadly weapons for no reason other than ego and stupidity.  They all had one thing in common.  Guess what it was?
Instructions unclear, now my balls have 3rd degree burns.
Why didn't he use his fist then huh?
What a coward. If your a kid reading this, don't ever be afraid to take an ass whooping. The fact that you even got in yhe fight makes you more than a man than any gun toting coward.  Even if you back down and people call you scared or weak, it takes a way bigger man to avoid confrontation and back down than any of these cowards. The real men are the ones who live to take care of their families. Being wrapped up in the streets as a young man, ill be the first to tell you the biggest cowards carried guns. Just a bunch of scared children is all they are.
Where there's more than 3 I will not be
put more guns on the street...
The fact that these kids really just went to go have a water fight and one died like are you fucking joking me
Nig ga really wanted to use high lvl guns on a noob server, what a buster
That's cheating
Alot of folks don't know the real. Them guys ask they guy who was their friend all was friends he went there to play basketball ball with them them guys jumped him they was gonna kill that boy he was defending himself. I feel for both of the families they both lost theirs sons. We gotta do better and stop the senseless violence. In our community county and state. There has to be a way or someone who is willing to reach out to these youths. I believe these kids aren't bad kids. I believe that they can be reached out too. Ive lost bother my parents recently my 5yr old nephew was murdered so was a friend of mine. I would give my life to help or save these kids. On my parents I will
0:14
People have no sense of humor to basic fun anymore.
I see racism here. Another victimised ethnic will be jailed for simply killing a non-valuable oppressor.
Bet his mug shot look's just like his Dad's
Ghetto is as ghetto dose
I thought BLM, I was wrong BLdon't Matter to blacks
Ice Bear feels horrible for the victim, his family and his friends. Rest in peace. People can't even have normal water fights anymore.
Blck people always trynna fight and think other races can’t fight but why they so quick to pick up guns and kill eachother, a bunch of punks
Damn sad smh
I'm hurt dad, interior them gut awh on wings I gt so much money dar the president's(dead) chill with me. Em I'm around stopping mukah from getting tuu ,  Daddy make mi.i smile
When your ego is fractured, that you fracture people’s lives.
Pathetic
He just forgot to load his watter bullets
Their mothers must be so proud!
Come to Germany :)
The insane byproduct of the "if you see something, say something" policies created by the tragedy of 911.. America has never been more scared and more divided and anyone wearing a lanyard can easily be identified as the ruling class that believes they are the slave masters and can question and control us,  their slaves.
So it had nothing to do with the water gun fight escalating, it was another group that approached and got into it with them..people they had personal issues with..but this title is better for clicks I guess
Water guns fight used to be so fun. This is extra sad and heartbreaking 💔
only this race does things like this
wow I wonder what race they ar-      oh, obviously
pvssy asz mf
I wish there was a death sentence where u would suffer the exact way u made ur victim suffer. If u don’t tell how u did it then u would be caged and shot and tormented or just stoned. Just sayin.
Where's Waldo?
He is a little loser hopefully he goes to jail for life all because of water fight along with the rest of them to all his friends are losers
To stupid to just play and let it go.
Peaceful culture
This is why we cant have nice things
Lol this is the reason why we never threw parties when I lived in the ghetto. So glad Im out of there and living around beautiful people with good hearts.
It's just another summer of love with yet another "mostly" peaceful protest. Kids these days...
*holding gun* *on camera* *pointing gun at guy who died*   "allegedly" -_-
Take that guy out back and do him like they did old yeller
I can’t even imagine being 20 years old and realizing you’re probably going to spend your entire life in prison!  This clown pulled a real gun at kids just having a water fight, made him feel like a big man. Made him feel in control. Now he’s in the belly of the beast, and the beast is in control. RIP to the victim.
Need to start looking at a certain culture. Seems like their culture is killing each other then yelling BlM what a joke.
It's in their DNA in a way they can't help it but that's what happens when you take quality DNA and water it down and degrade it you get that result 💯  #AirTakers
People that can't tell the difference between a water gun, and a real gun, shouldn't really have the right to own a license.
Nothings going to change until you start putting criminals away
this nigga an actual buzzkill
Wow Fayetteville is a quiet place for retirement people
Let me guess.. Yup.. Not surprised
Now they're going to Outlaw water guns people just can't play fairly. When you get sprayed by water it doesn't even hurt come on guys. But projectile sure do.
Good lord after seeing this how can BLM ✊🏿
So no matter what they do. The population control program they impose on each other prevails again.
I think america needs a about 18 months of dictatorship to clean up these democratic cities of all these criminals they keep letting out of jail.
Bcuz he has a gun that makes him think he was better than annyone but he just got arrested
Country assed tough guys!
Bruh how in the hell that happens
GUILTY!
That is the us for you
Exactly why I got a gun soft ahh mfs can’t fight and go grab a gun first🤦🏾‍♂️
Ppl be Dying
Hello ! As a french, I need to tell u that USA looks for the rest of the world the most anarchist country... You keep trying to be the most securized country in the world but you can be killed by an adolescent who find a gun coz you are giving guns as candies... And know, you are prohibiting the abortion law... Im so disappointed coz before i wanna live in your country ...
Nah fr tho...ago what happened? Water fight people threw at people that wasn't playing? Or bball players just wanted act tough for no reason?
This is what police forces have to deal with nightly across the USA.  They have to babysit people that, for some reason, have been given an excuse to behave like idiots and remain un-scrutinized by society. Even worse they have to do this knowing Hollywood,  TV and "Media" are waiting for anything they can use to convince the public the police and the rest of America are the "Problem".  For some reason, many people buy the lie that the men and women who are forced to deal with the violence and lawlessness are the villains in our real-life story.  To many years of watching fiction where the bad guy is the likable one I guess.
Thats an intense water gun
Another satisfying racial moment
Another clown scared to fight
Everybody gangster till the *water starts smelling like lead*
Man you can't even have a harmless water gun fight in america without getting killed/shot. America is a fucked up place to be and to live
Yes abortions are safe. For who?
one group looks like kids having fun, the other like pack of wild dogs walking like zombies with the dumbest and most emotional leading the pack.
Another brother dead and another life ruined 🤦🏽‍♂️
A fatherless America 🇺🇸!! Just call it what it is!! 🤨
🤡smh
For the educated, let me explain what is going on here…https://youtu.be/RZr444qAi-8
People with guns are cowards
Nigga got mad cause he couldnt play
At my highschool one of my teachers told us a story about two freshmen who had a fight because they stared at each other.
The guns and killing is getting old already, i want to hear some different news
Betas will be betas
Idk why u would see i group of schoolers playing and just decide to come and just shoot somone like bro u have to be rlly mad to do such a thing thats rlly messed up
Rest of the persons that were with the criminal, should be charged with gang activity considering they also approached the victim unprovoked (by the looks of the video).  *Those that say it's not fair too take the kids future away from them. Need to realize that they're already hanging around murderers and acting like thugs. A.K.A. lost causes.
Wtf teens students carrying guns?
I'll put 500 on none of them graduated, the basketball players
“Let’s get water guns” “Ok”  “Now let’s get nerf guns” “Ok”  “Now let’s get air soft guns” “Ok..”  “Now let’s ge-“ “Don’t fucking say it”
not surprised by the color NGL
when youre tired of playing the game on easy mode
Once again we made abortions illegal...such a POS lil ninja you wanna box ok why you shoot that young man over Nothing you don't know better than that😔
Sounds more like the group who walked up are a gang! Sad someone had to die because of a thug!
Why show still pics instead of the movie tape
according to Americans this would have been better if everyone there had a real gun
by the body language of the guy with the gun i can assess that he said "that water better not touch me or we gon have a problem" trynna look tough over something you couldve avoided
lets see how hard he his when he gets life
I hope he never gets out! Rot in prison, he already has a rotten soul
Did slowly and painfully... for ETERNITY
Sooo they were so uneducated and hurt In life that they kill someone over words...yikes. why do children have guns anyways 🤬
The kid: Pfff you guys are using a water gun? try a real gun for a change
they should remove this guy's legs just as punishment
Give the BIT@$ life in prison without parole!!!
I had a watergun fight and they just grabbed the hose. They were great water guns tho
Property values just dropped even lower in that area.
I knew what kind of people where involved just by readiing the title of the video.
WHAT
I mean it's a gun free zone...how'd this law abiding citizen get a gun 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I see a common denominator
Yup, the usual suspects. A 17 year old kid was just stomped to death at Lebron James high school because his friends were acting like idiots and shot 3 guys playing basketball with water gel pellets.
Wtf is wrong with georgia. So much crime.
hey thats not a water gun.
They are all members of BLM. I can't believe it
We need to have more stop and frisk laws to keep guns away from these gangs.
Losers!
Can’t even play without getting shot and killed wtf!?
Bro pulled out a real gun
That one guy that brings a real gun to a water gun fight🤦🏻‍♂️
BLM
GUNS GUNS GUNS
Guys with straps always gotta find a reason to use it
I want gun culture in my country too !!!!!
Innocent kid died because of a water fight ? That’s messed up
Underage with a handgun not legal to own
Kids need Ui
Just ignorant and stupid. They even walk stupid. 🚶‍♀️
Who killed who?  Exactly  Now blame the cops for not being there.
WTF!?!?!?! That's the reason we can't have nice things.
Well, it is their culture
BLM
Where is the blm? lmao!!!
Makin it real hard to support yall 💀
Fawking Whypeepo 🤡
What a complete bunch of scum bags. Young people that think they are the badest around ??? Poor young man and his family. Lock him and his friends up for the rest of their lives. Simple !
How can there be an exchange of gunfire with only one group has a real gun?
Super sad, they were trying to have good innocent fun.  Just horrible

Man’s had to be on drugs yo
You can take the nugget out the hood, but never the hood out the nugget Keep shooting each other nuggets, you’ll never be s*** bcz you are s***
So no exchange in gun fire ... you would think the sheriff would be more exact.
Throw the monkeys in jail and keeps them locked up
Can’t even have fun without someone’s feelings getting hurt enough to shoot you
Welcome to Biden’s America! And it keeps getting worse!
ignorant MFs. they're everywhere too. Keep trying to normalize them media.
BLM cops are always escalating situations with us BLM . Or lives matter but not more than water
The news is so cap. This had nothing to do with water guns they were probably opps
The sad legacy of the bad old slavery days.....
Wtf
Damn can’t even have innocent fun huh
Thug all u can say
BLM is a joke
Aaaaaaaaaand they are all.....
George Floyd’s children
Shawn is the type of guy to sent someone their full home address, phone number, bank details, credit card details and send a photo of their exact house key just over a discord argument
The nerve people have to think they can just kill. I am just discovering this story.
This is truly sad to hear!
Where is BLM at now? Such a terrible thing that happened. All over a water gun fight.
No tough guys in Buffalo New York?
Welcome to USA 🇺🇸
Bunch of highschool bullies
" Niggas busting shots like they lost they mind! Like 25 to life never crossed they mind! " - Tupac
Trial,conviction and public execution all in the same month..our justice system is a joke..if you can’t live peacefully among us, you shouldn’t live…
He said "gun shots exchanged". I didn't here anything about the water kids having a gun.
Y’all didn’t watch the video? It’s two separate groups fighting.
How stupid are people?
Grown mfs messing with high school seniors, wtf man.
what color are they?
Really wonder how these people get guns when they don't have a job. Shows you how fuked up this world is.
13%
DAM
Only in America can a water fight turn into a shoot out. But what would I know, I’m just an oppressed Australian waiting out my days for Marshall law to ruin my livelihood because I don’t have handguns to protect myself from an entire army.
Good job a meeting will solve it all
Too many in one place and Pookie is bound to shoot Tyrone.
The quirky notify pharmacodynamically balance because throne subjectively trap plus a abiding camel. military, attractive ice
Why did they come over to the parking lot anyway? Doesn’t make sense to me. If you don’t want to get wet stay away from them. Sad you can’t have fun with ur friends without worrying if someone will shot you
Squirt squirt  BANG BANG.. O-.... wrong party?
What is the point of taking someone s life away. The same will happen back to u. In a much worse very, long, slow, miserable way.
Damn he's not even old enough to own a handgun
Seriously. Hey this is my park how dare you have fun. Just play your stupid basketball game are better yet get a job and buy your own basketball goal of you even know how to work that is
Bro corny for that, frfr. Gonna be know as a loser for the rest of his life for this, this wasn’t tough at all
40 years! For nothing. Sad!
ATL needs some help RIP to the kid
Young people can't even have fun anymore. Heathen everywhere just waiting to start trouble. If you hate yourself and your life don't mess or take someone else's. Absolutely ridiculous.
You would think that after years for fighting for freedom, but the last thing you might think about doing is going to prison to be a slave to the system. Not very smart
Truly Sad your 16-17 taking someone’s life for nothing . Even more sad he’s already condemned to hell…
They're not even the little pistols! Those are OBVIOUSLY water guns. WTF
Too bad this ain't the wild West
Good job Brothers
Well that's the problem right there. It's a Hih Scuu.
dude can't fight at all smh
Let him rot in prison
How Sway?!?!?!? How you make a water gun fight deadly Sway?!?!?!?
Why am i not surprised
Why don’t folks see what the problem is from all of these violent news videos????
Thats so sad they were just having fun and these kids just go out of there way to come start trouble with them and end up killing 1 of them thats just tragic.
Trigger happy prices should never be given a hand gun. Disgusting taking the life of an innocent teen having fun. Sic
Is that 21 savage?
If you want to fix the problem admit to the problem and who and why they are so aggressive.  Just sad.
When will Americans realise that the very idea of kids walking around with guns is insanely moronic to the rest of the world
It's all fun and games until you show up at a gun fight with a watergun.
More gang violence. More ego by the new age hip hop drug dope and murder culture. Sad
I’m just saying, notice the race
The alleged shooter with an alleged gun that allegedly shot an alleged bullet..  it's on video for crying out loud
Can’t even have fun smh 🤦‍♂️
The staggering amount of senselessly racist replies to comments is wild.   An idiot made a dumb decision based on thoughtless rage who deserves every consequence that comes with it and  A young person that didn’t deserve to die.
Well, that’s sad. The murder suspect should not be on this planet. Take one’s life, you shouldn’t have one either.
BLLLLLAAAAAAACCCCKKKKKSSS...
Read the title, thought, “what’re they shooting acid?”
obamas children doing what their genes tell them to do.
13%....
What happens when you bring a water gun to a gun fight... What? Too soon? Just making fun that there's no gun problem, just people problems right?
The dropouts coming to cause drama nothing better else to do but take someone who was actually graduating life away from them I guess smh I hope you are under the jail
Weak men.
Throw away the key. I’m confused at what moment does it turn so bad that u rather kill another brother instead of walking away. Hold these men accountable to the full extent. Next time u decide to pick up a gun remember this guy
This is the epitome of ignorant behavior and not thinking of the consequences of your actions.  RIP to the fallen/injured and their families.  And I hope the family of the perpetrator finds peace, along with the person himself.
We have to do better and recognize the real enemy..
Upstanding basketball Americans.
Peak high time preference behaviour.
enough proof to say we live in a world were everyone is so sensitive and try act touch
America.
Not only did he kill another kid, But he killed himself over what? I guess he didn't like the fact that the others were having fun and acting like kids?
Statics shows that most mass shooters or shooters in general are actually more B than W.
I've ever seen so much psychopaths in a single country tham in US. (I mean if you don't count Africa and Middle-East)
Thugs and killers playing basketball with guns in their shorts Play water gun fight in the parking lot turns into a real killing scene. Sherriff wants to make Kenwood Park safer for everyone,.Yea, sure. Good Luck with that. You'll need it.
Just out of curiosity because this was never blown up on the news and made a big deal. What race are they?
B.L.M. YA 👌
Usual suspect.
Fake gangsters wanna play with their super soakers until one "big dog" gets butthurt because hes a little baby and pulls out a side arm and takes a life. Fucking idiot but honestly what do we expect these days with every 18 year old pretending to be tough.
Not surprised at all anymore!!
America would be a lot better off if they were never brought overseas
Keep voting liberal to live 3rd world
Trash ass culture
Typical
B.o.b.c
Cops are trying to protect their heroine dealer.  That's why
Make it seem like they killed over water . When it was punches
Typical for americans.
obviously the fault of a system built with such faulty foundations.  I didn't know that murder was punishable anymore.
POS. Unbelievably selfish.
Need to have harsher punishments for cold blooded murder.
And people wonder why BLM don’t matter. Yeah, if the roles were reversed people would call the shooter a racist. BLM are the real racist trash now. I mean they have returned racism and are causing more people to become racist. Way to shame your own kind by becoming what you hate now.
Pathetic.
if only there was more guns
Give em water guns, enough melanin, and sure enough, eventually the real guns come out. It's their culture.
This is one of the reasons I don't go outside
As a Texan I love guns. Just hate idiots like that.
The stupidity is real. Now 1 life lost and another going to rot in jail.
When the father is missing from the home it raises cowards
How the hell? What is wrong with people that they get so offended these days? I can hear the school now, sorry guys we can’t hold the annual water gun fight because somebody died last year. This is just terrible God bless the victims family and friends and God help that young man that was so butt hurt he needed to kill somebody.
Usual suspect
Democrats in training.  Nothing to see here.
Maybe putting rappers who sing about dope and killing people for petty reasons on a pedestal wasn't a good idea
You can't even have fun anymore.
Just look at àll that hate
Thank God I grew up when all we did was fight with our fist and who ever loses the fight give respect to the winner and then become friends. This generation is so different and in my opinion is in a very tough situation. I can't imagine growing up during this time, it must be so hard for the young people that's trying to live the right way and just want to get through life without being killed. I feel for them. I blame most on the parents that most are young themselves and don't have a clue how to raise children. But sometimes the child grows up and no matter how good the parents treat them, they develop a mind of their own and make bad decisions that will effect their lives and the lives they destroy for ever.
Just like Gun Smoke 🤠 Hang high in public 😵
Crack babies in full bloom
We are the problem; us Blacks and our over aggressive ways. Just to beat on our chest, imagine if we really were tough. Always remember it is the gun that is the true threat, you are just the coward holding it.
Anyone who thinks that the water fight has anything to do with the gun fire needs to understand they are so wrong.
Atlanta is well on its way to becoming the Chicago of the South
When you're to weak so you need to use a gun, probably have a body made of glass 😂
I hope they bury him under the prison for being so God damn immature and taking a life for no reason other than pride and a low IQ
Such wonderful kids. I see them playing basketball where I live. They have no respect for families. They swear and yell. No families feel safe around them. Obama might be proud
This why u always stay strapped.  Never know wen there's gonna be a water gun fight.... Rest in peace young soul.
0.9 gpa activities
Idk why I watch these videos every time i do they make me angry
Soft for pulling out a gun when you getting your ass whooped! Take it like a man you loose you loose! Now you killed someone and you in Jail for a long time smh
Arrest em, give them the life in prison without any chance to get out of there, seems just resonable, an eye for an eye
Statistics don't lie....common denominator
What was a 20 year old doing in a high school parking lot?
If you want to make the park safer for everyone, set a skin tone limit.
Bruh it’s just water..do you not shower?
These are the people that need to "mysteriously" end up dead in a jail cell.
So many angry people in the US
Put the whole basket ball team in prison for 50 years.
The honest truth is that the killer didn’t anticipate surveillance video, or he might have thought twice.
cops are not the problem in this country!!!
The man is serving a life sentence.
When keeping it real gets too real. And you dropped your gun? Wtf?
Mistakes can be fix but death cannot be fix just becareful
America in a nutshell.
Fragile ass ego.. pathetic
Don't bring a squirt gun to a gunfight.
Dumb.
this is what happens when you embrace “diversity”
This is so fking stupid
What ever culture you have that causes this to happen is barbaric, and disgusting. Do better by your community, you know what you are doing and what you are creating.
Hmmmm no comment
Allegedly??? Bruh the gun right there the body right there is legit on tape lmao
i guess his  water gun wasn't big enough
Ignorance.
Autistic.
Autism.
Autism.
Oh so you gon spray me with water on a hot day to cool me off thank you but also BOP BOP BOP!
Most dont understand.    The hood teens would put urine and bleach in those water guns when i was growing up.  Get bleached urine sprayed on you, may push someone off the ledge to cause them the fire their guns.  Specially short tempered teens.
It's nerf or nothing
Sounds about America
This wasn't a squirter gun fight that escalated. A group of people were having a squirt gun fight and another group walked up and shot a real gun.
Who brings a gun to a squirt gun game.
How???? Just fucking how???
That sounds about the right amount of Atlanta. Now, time to go find a Florida story that sounds like a Florida story.
I can only imagine the basketball gunman saw his car got wet and decided murder was the response...
Kids can’t even play with water guns anymore without threat of violence, between the climate and the way society is going, I don’t even think I wanna have kids given how the world is gonna be by the time they’re my age
How sad.
Imagine being so emotionally unstable and having such a HUGE misunderstanding of the term gangster that you slaughter a child over water.
It’s always the “cool kids” that just end up with stuff bro, these are the type of people at my school.
Racist don’t say that say sorry
Turned deadly, oh what a shocker. A race of people that get their male tampons in a twist if someone accidentally steps on their Chinese made shoes. Made me ask this question, if you didn't see this coming, just blow your head.
Like an episode of boondocks in that park
Dumm und traurig zugleich
He got what he deserved.  Don't squirt people with water
Too much kool aid
Parents should be ashamed. Bums
Crazy.. never have nice things.
This is terrible, that people are shooting others over something that at most should have ended as a fist fight I'm sure because they're too scared of losing a fight.
Mess with wild animals long enough eventually you will get bit.
How sad and dumb
I'd like to know how many times the killer has been arrested and then turned loose to commit more crimes. Crime is out of control while prisons are closing in the U.S. That just doesn't add up. The killer is to blame for this but I'd still like to know how many other people he's killed and how many more people's lives he's destroyed.
watergun fights can sometimes escalate into something bad.  Perhaps a bit of water gets through a car window, soaks a seat, then the guy retaliates by dumping a bottle of water into another vehicle, or attempts to soak someone elses property...everyone is tired, hot, upset...
Talk about killing vibe
people dont have the balls to just throw punches without resorting to weapons these days.
I know this is sad but that anchor tho 😅
Im sure their life mattered too.. but you won’t see that group touch this with a 10 foot pole.
What is wrong with these older kids? I mean when I run into people that were even three years ahead of me in high school we talked like old friends.  If I came across some of the sophomores or Juniors That I Used to Know back in the day having a water gun fight I would probably ask if I could join. Sounds like all of those older class men are worthless and need to go to jail.
These peare such a nightmare.
Shyt don’t make sense young and dumb but ppl wonder why blk ppl not looked at as a normal citizen Lack of common sense and knowledge  Scared of an ass whooping ego want allow them to take an L in front of females
😂😂😂 USA what a Country
Well it shows how life doesn't matter for stupidity he and that group of basketball players should all be locked up with keys thrown away.
Looks like he shot him in the back SMH what a punk
So no blm here
Children
Here's reality that group rolled in together to cause problems every last one of them needs to be held accountable on that murder
It's a cultural thing - nothing to see here.
America 🤭
Why he standing like childish gambino 0:34
being tough get ya nowhere hate ppl who act like that
Are people of color involved? Ready to kill over a word
Be careful of physically weak kids with guns. That ego is chained to the gun
And they say we tryna be culture vultures lmao I don’t want no part of this goofy stuff
Tough guy when he’s with his friends or with a gun in his hand like a rat if the person cross from you dosent have a gun than you should t touch one
"Couldn't do 4 years of college but gone do 25 to life "
It only takes a couple seconds to see what went wrong here.
Only in the African American community... smh
This news is annoying 😠. What happened? The other guys were playing way on the other side.. unless there was beef before
I am not born as an American and lived in America for years.. I could say that "Americans" have a problem with their cultural behaviour... when kids turn to teens they start to act like gangsters thinking it's cool... that's the only country I know that does that and I lived in Germany, South Korea, Philippines, visited alot of countries from central America, China, Russia, Japan, Hawaii which is also USA... and Guam.. like I am telling you, America has a gun problem and an attitude problem. Americans are so softy they get offended or pist immediately 0 filter. So for any foreigners who wants to visit USA.. don't joke with most of them, they can't take a joke, they are sore losers, cry baby by blood and nature.
it's sad how one second your having fun enjoying life and the next second some mf decides to end it and u can't do anything about it.
... thank GOD I wasn't born in the USA ...
Small dick energy coming off the shooter. Gettin emotional over a little water coming his way
Where’s BLM—- too many blacks killing blacks and we as a people are doing nothing to change things. It’s scary stuff —- even high schoolers are packing heat
Coward couldn’t fight so he had to use a gun. What a disgusting scumbag. Death penalty please.
How can you shoot a gun without thinking of the repercussions? This guy must really wanted to live in the prison
and y'all are still saying America doesn't need stricter gun control.
Useless people.
nice place
Wonder when America will finally stop making buying guns so easy
Guns and basketball never ever go together.
Keep giving handouts
Their even agry torwds each there this is a type of get a head with astalty .
Bro the thumbnail the car looks like quandal dingles face
Lmao
Coward
BLM
“this why we can’t have nice things”
So sad
What a punk. How you gonna shoot a real gun because you got sprayed with water.
A real ninja moment Jogger "this was a perfectly good moment to throw away our lives!"
BLM
Only in America.
Anyone who kills someone else except if their protecting themselves or their family should never be allowed to leave prison and they should stay there until they die.
“That’s The Culture”
The symbiotic relationship America has with guns is so strange
These dang Wakandans don't know how to relax and have fun
At least he had the balls to turn himself in. The cowards are those that take they own life.
POCs
Nigha alert 🚨 nigha activity
Thug life, never bring a gun to a water gun fight, you know what I am sayin cuh?
Smart
BLM 🤣
What's new? Just petty Americans doing their NORMAL routine.🤷🏼‍♂️  "An american with a gun" should be normal by now.
The needle for this kinda thing
Sean Allen's mommy said he couldn't get wet.
People who can’t think clearly don’t need a gun. My first thought before I shoot someone illegally is am I being recorded. 99% of the time yes you are.
Damm nigga you dident have to kill a nigga
I just don’t understand people
BLM why don’t u protest the bs your people be doing on the daily
bozos with guns as usual fucking cretins,enjoy being someone girlfriend in prison tough guy
Emotional basketcases
What a coward to go for a gun instead of his own fists.
Lol
How about finding employment? So many lifeless losers on the street sucking up welfare and behaving like animals.

Give him life  Since he took 1
A high school parking lot of donut burnout marks. Yeah, it been crappy before this incident.
I always wish some punk like this with try to approach me I'm 44 years old I'm ready for this but unfortunately it never happens I think it's probably because I look like a thug myself with a face full of tattoos even though I have a concealed carry still I cannot get anyone to be brave enough
Shouldn’t have gotten her hair wet.
Why is this not surprising, at all?
Wtf is wrong with people
BLM quiet than a MF
Racisms made him do it.  Blame the boogie man.  He was on his way to church.  Hahahahaha
Somebody should tell these people that BLM.  Hahahahaha!
So hood!!!
13 50 🤷‍♂️
Basketball and rap culture in a nut shell there. I bet the shooter wears his pants down to his knees as well. He will be ready for some man love in prison at least with his pants like that.
Just looked it up and he was sentenced to life
😭😭🤬
No surprise here
engineer gaming
🤣
That’s a real shame, there are countless ‘hood’ communities that are using these tactics along with paintball guns etc to lessen gun violence and have a little fun at the same time, I think this is a FANTASTIC idea/out for the youth whom are prone to or grew up in violent neighborhoods/settings - someone always gota f*ckin RUIN IT! 🤬 shame shame shame, I hope that young man gets what he deserves and RIP to the victim - 🙏🏻 for his family … PUT THE GUNS DOWN
Ah yes the community was enriched by the local basketball americans.
“ I told you not to squirt me cuh !”  Insecure offended fool. Look at you now your gonna be in a cell for life and for what ? Cause he hurt your feelings ? SMH.
That's sad
I bet there was playing some kind of rap on the background somewhere...
Always that 1 nigga u can't take anywhere
Excecute this piece of crap on tv for everyone to see what happens or should happen to those who commit criminal homicides. He lost his salvation in the flesh and mankind needs to send him to GOD and victim ASAP. He's a waste of space on earth
This is why I will NEVER go into Atlanta ...ever!
wow cowards to have to use guns SAD
We should just bring executions back and make the process last less then a month. The threat of being killed slowly infront of everyone who hates you( cause your loved ones aren’t allowed) would be a strong punishment that not only rectifies a terrible wrong but also can be used as an example. Dude doesn’t deserve life he deserves death.
Guns dont make you a man . It makes you a Coward .
Why dose this happen 😕
Fken hater😂😂😂 Now you in jail for life
How sad, a bunch of kids have having a good time, not bothering anyone and a bunch of evil bully thugs preys on, and murders them! I sure hope they catch em!
Poor gun laws..  what  else  to say..
You are totally right muricans your gun laws are perfectly reasonable.
Wow & they had nothing to do with it!
Officer, it’s just red food coloring. We were having a harmless water gun fight.
BLM tho
Disgusting, and so typical. "They" never change how they act
Only crime i see is what happened to those water guns Who ever the hell is the monster thats guilty of doing this deserves to be sentenced for life
I’m sure that his parents are proud
America, Land of the Armed.
Purely socially economical issue's
Fayette and Clayton county are helplessly ghetto and the cancer is still spreading out from those locations.
Weird… bl@ck people….
atlanta is full of crime.. wonder why.
The total lack of self control is  horrendous, life in prison for that fool....🤬🇨🇦
This says it all!
Notice the skin color
Tryna flex in front them hoes now gotta spend the rest of his life in prison around all niggas 😂
Where are you Al Sharpton???
Was gun fire exchanged or did one guy shoot, wtf is the news reporting
How stupid can you get? Shooting someone because of a water gun fight. It never ends.
I remember a time when men handled problems with fist. Now it looks like we got a bunch of kids playing toys
Another coward with a gun. Glad you hated your freedom more than hated that young man, trying to enjoy being with his friends. What a punk mentality I’m sure all those” friends “ you were trying to be tough , in front of, will put money on your books and come visit you in jail.
Water fights sure have changed since i was a kid
Only happens with very specific groups of people with. Specific skin tone.
Lockup the perpetrators and throw away the key!
Imagine these a-holes start making waterguns illegal for all of us
They can't even have a water gun fight without their rich culture fucking it up.
Sometimes people just get killed. You have to be aware of who you're dealing with.
Yeah, these basketball homies are always the ones causing trouble.
There was probably a beef about something else that escalated over
That's why I never went to another Senior  Picnic, here in Detroit.  Kid got murdered over a wet dress.
Pffft yall can't act right FOR NOTHING!!!!
Isnt the first time they killed each other over squirt guns
How did he get a gun?  Crazy!
This is why we can't have nice things
It’s always one set of people seems like
I can't believe people can take away someone's life this easy
Wow !
#BlackLivesMatter
rofl when your shirt off you know they stupid
Only in The US, water guns end with real guns!! 🤣 I know, it’s not funny but funny!
"allegedly "? Hahaha ok
That's america for you
Boondocks episode.
Strange how he went through school being so stupid
American education system at it's finest.
What scared little punks
M O R O N S
One dead and the other threw the rest of his life away and scared everyone who was there and there families over some ego BS.
Paintball fights. Water gun fights. Thats hella dumb guys. How stupid are you people
Don't worry; there is a meeting scheduled
Keep the animals out of the park if you want to make it safer.   Pretty simple
Typical low lever thinking Jamal.😢
Death penalty  no jail straight to death chamber  and put down
former students are no students so they not even allowed to be on that property.  just 2 weeks after i finished with school we were sitting on a bank on the school property which is puplicly accessable. after a short time police showed up and ordered us to leave. i said i was a student of this school just 2 weeks ago. he said that doesnt matter. if im not a student im not allowed to be here. and this was a publicly accessable area. no fence, nothing.
20 year old high school student humm
Soon as I seen FOX 5 Atlanta I knew what type of ppl that were involved.
I blame this on rap and ignorant people
It's so pathetic I can't believe it R.I.P Senior and best wishes to his family
Unbelievable
Geez, kids these days. I hope they throw the book at him.
Someone drown?
It's in their culture
Probably had a history of violence at school, they still let him come to school. Schools get funding paid for each student by the government. They aren't protecting the students they are exploiting them. The system is set up based on exploitation systems, which of course, is a relic of industrialized child labor and slave systems.
Saw something like that on animal planet once. Its sad.Its all over territory I'm guessing.
Weak asf
I hope these type of people die out like mythical creatures, only to exist in fable. Sick, murderous and stupid people
When its legal to have guns to "protect" yourself....
Know y’all fools can’t do anything involving any type of gun play smh
He'll be getting bent over for the next 25 years in a state pen.
it’s a cultural thing
what can you expect
Perfect example of how to go through life being a dumbass. Can’t even just have fun anymore.
welcome to Atlanta
wouldnt be surprised if schools start banning assassin because of this
Defund the police!  And those racist water guns!
Nobody can judge the shooter. We don’t know what none of them do in their personal lives. You can get upset about my comment but it’s the truth.
That news lady..
Whata clown
They'll be squirting him with something other than water once he gets to prison.  He's a pretty boy . Pearl necklaces , daily facials . WORD 😁😲
Not a big surprise.
what that dude on fuckin crank or something
Sensitive guys  The water hurts  Hurts their feelings 🤣
Love the denial in the comments
Why isn’t the death penalty still a thing? At least make it a 24hr ordeal to bring the pain out
Gulag
We're doomed, too stupid to live
America
Ridiculous
aww more underpriveledged minority youth
America
We used to have water gun fights all the time , what’s wrong with the world nowadays 😩 can’t do nothing no more smh RIP high schooler
That news anchor a baddie
Ever try to fill your watergun with water, but the hydrant poured bullets instead?
seems like water part of it had no bearing in the incident
Funny how dudes who act all hard have the most fragile egos and insecurities.
Way to blm, this is what you need to fix in your community.
Only stupid people bring a real gun to a water fight… wtf
USA! USA! USA! USA!
Eventually you would think they would start arresting these shlt azz parents for raising these pathetic kids.
Kids can’t even have water fights without  stupid ass criminals killing people. Pos needs to rott in hell
what led up to the violence huh?  A lack of morals and a surplus of kids being raised without fathers.  Thats what led to this.
the system keeps on winning
13%
He “allegedly” fires the gun. Yeah I think we can clearly see him fire the gun.
Just a group of sterotypes doing what sterotypes do.
what a surprise this was in atlanta
And this is why all these videos about paintball and airsoft fights in cities don't amuse me because it's only a matter of time for something like this to happen in these neighborhoods. It's not right but that's the world we live in. If you run around with what looks like a weapon, somebody out there is bound to see it as real.
thats a crazy culture
America, land of the free... Yeah free to be murdered by a kid with an ego problem and a gun. Like every "USA" chanting man child would behave if he could get away with it. What kind of wimp needs a gun? How pathetic! Well done children. Enjoy prison life.
He gotta protect his rep...
This some bs man. Coward culture is in full effect
so u an adult shooting at high schoolers when u should be in college or working smh bums
This is what Dumbacrats raise
most american title i've ever read
Weak ass mad they ain't invite him
The shooter is a joke
That man is insane. So stupid
He won't last long in there with that mindset. Karma is bi*ch, and that bi*ch don't love yaa 🤬
N words
How dumb could you be do something like that ?  Like how you’re not gonna end up in jail for life ?  I don’t understand how people can be so empty in the head it blows my mind really
Atlanta should be removed from the planet
muricans...you need more guns!
who is the fox presenter?
13=50
where is the protest for this life? I guess his life does not matter.
PLAY STUPID WATER GUN GAMES....WIN STUPID WATER GUN PRIZES !!!
Godspeed....sorry but even God can't outrun a bullet...this is something humans can control on their own , move to Canada:) it's beautiful, no guns to worry about., our hunters use their guns when needed ..not when wanted...
Why do the kids have access to guns..when will USA learn....like your all about protecting your people , well fucking protect your people !!! Dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
Rap culture has ruin Atlanta youth ask Young Thug lol
Pretty sure Gunpowder isn't water
Bunch of thugs, what did you expect to happen?
Why do they even have real guns around?  Only Murica - cheers from Europe 😘
Lmao more gangsta nega shyt
guess the sk
Someone brought the wrong gun
I can't say absolutely he deserves the death penalty but if this is a gang related killing he does.
I seen a documentary about these folks....I think it was a national geographic
imagine how many people still would be alife if u americans wouldnt instist in having guns "freedom to carry one"  NA people dont realize how the entire world is laughing at them degenerates
Wow!! I'm shocked!
He said don’t get his hair wet
A flock of degenerate losers comes along and ruins everybodies life
Man why people can have a gun
Crazy country with crazy children
Has blm looked into this matter? I hear they are on top of this type of crime
See why God cursed humanity  because we chose to do things like this. Our choice not His
If they have a video why are they telling what supposedly happened ... media should never be trusted unless they show facts
What a pathetic country America is
Give me some rope
Sure, make it so everyone's allowed to have guns they said, its a 'right' they said, ... thoughts and prayers they said. And people argue that America isnt a systemic, societal failure.
Its a real cultural problem.  Not just an ethnic problem, but a country wide cultural issue.
Out bad not a water gun fight
this is why I don't interact with society
yow homie lets roam around gta style..
Metal detectors at parks and armed police too .
How’s that thug life workin out? Quit glorifying criminals and demonizing officers and less people will die over ignorant crap like this. But whatever, y’all do you.
Remember guns don't make you a man, but 👊🏻 make you a man, you win some you lose some but you live to fight another day.
So dude put out his own gun dropped it and it discharged firing into someone's foot, then takes someone else gun and kills the student. What a jackass
Usual suspects
Dey wuz disrespeckin him an stuf cuh.  This crap doesn’t even surprise me anymore and I already know what the deal is when I hear headlines like this. It’s always the same group and similar story.
He dropped his gun so he borrowed one from his friend?  How many handguns are needed for a basketball game?
Bro brought the wrong kinda gun
i read `life in prison" Good!
"damn this water gun looks crazy!"
Poor kids loving gun fight
But y?
This why cops are as hard as they are
Gangsters. This is what they do.
Niggas need to chill
I really hate people who act like gang bangers and even if you actually are one, ITS NOT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF. You’re not alll big and bad because you can carry a gun, wave it around, and kill people, you’re ignorant, weak, and evil. I see the lives these people live and it’s not a good one so why keep it up? Just to ruin your own life even though you’ve seen thousands before you do the EXACT same thing. Idc who you are, the way you grew up or where you grew up is not an excuse for that kind of behavior, make a change for yourself.
Didn’t make it out the gulag I see
Where’s BLM to protest this?
Well you will probably get a life sentence and none of them cowards you were with will be there for you as you goto prison all of them need to be charged
They were jealous of these kids having fun
Bye bye
He must been a putty cat cuz he got mad when hit with water
The park is fine the park is not the problem. You guys need to start sending these thugs away to prison for a long long time on lesser crimes so they're not running around murdering people.
Does anything good happen in the ATL?
Cant have fun anymore.
Blm
Wtf is wrong with people
Coulda just squabbled it out in the parking lot and lived to see another day, sad to see lives lost over something so trivial.
Welcome to fantastic America.
Don't drop the soap
back in da day there where no guns and violence on tv so there was no guns and violence in the streets
I'm sure the second group is all a group of activists for BLM by now lol
Making the parks safer how about stop selling stupid guns to kids or people.  dear america
I guess Water Guns are Cancelled now.
Hopefully at least one of his little thug friends realized acting like a gangster wasn't worth going to prison and turned his life around. But chances are, not likely.
Well he proved what he wanted, he's a hardcore thug. Why was it so important to him that people knew this, I don't know. But now he gets to act like a hardcore thug in prison.. and the rest of the world moves on without him. Forever remembering him as that hardcore gangsta whos packin. But not really because we will all forget about him immediately
BLM!
Just idiots everywhere
Kids now days are pu**y*!! We used to have watergun fights food fights marker fights pencil fights paper clip fights ect. And it would escalate but we never went to the GUN and even in the 80's 90's us high school kids had guns in the trunks of our cars but we never shot each other over dumb games/ dumb girls/ or any dumb shi+!! You know why becuse us Gen xers back in the 80 90's would rather fight you hand to ✋️ 🤚  hand combat but kids don't do that now they are cowards running in packs of wolves and have to be put down like a rabbid dog!!
did yall see the blm protests for this? oh wait ...
The water gun fight did not turn deadly. Seems to me there was a group of people having a water fight, then a group of trouble makers started an altercation. Member of said group shoots and kills someone. The water fight had absolutely nothing to do with what happened. That kid was looking for something and I guess that something was life in prison.
What a bunch of idiots over a water gun fight? And who would have guessed it's the same group of suspects?
God bless him he is in a beutfiul place I hope the boy who did this gets help and has mercy from the law on his part
Ah man of culture showing why it needs to change
Imagine allowing the civilians in your country to own firearms :) In my country we don't have news like that for a reason.
Where's BLM when you need them...oh wait, nvm
Put em down. 20 year old doesn't deserve anymore life.
When impressing the bitches go wrong.
And you wonder why people are racist towards the colored
I honestly do not understand the mentality of young people nowadays, we use to fight and have “ beef “ but we all went home that day and usually the next day we were all friends.
Rest in Peace, to the high school student. And, prayers for the family, and friends effected by this tragedy.
These people who kill other people just because of their ego or pride need to start getting life in prison and shown to be example of especially teenager now a days. They always get away with it because their young. These kids now what they are doing. They have more knowledge and are more aware of what’s going on then back in the day. They’re just too stupid to see the opportunities they have now
I see most people as weak and impatent. Lazy and stupid. People choose to take short cuts and try to put on a persona that they aren't. If someone is willing to fist fight and instead of engaging in a fair fight they shoot. Dumb and weak by choice and their parents raise them to be this way. Either there are one parent homes, dysfunctional living, or the parents are teaching the kids to act this way. If you don't hold everyone in that direct area responsible it will never change
It is always the same  clowns. Be a human, not an animal.
Vile animals.
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Can’t take you people anywhere.
These kids are just playing water fight and YOU (older than em) gonna start beefing and punching them over it? Fucking scums of life.
Hooray second amendment. :)
God this reminds me of the time a person that lives on the same street as me tried to kill with a metal bat because I got him wet in a water war I was having with my friends when I was at lest 8 years old
Never relax...
God Damn Monsters. Check yourselves.
Sean Evans will be spending 30 years in prison for being a tough guy with a gun. What a complete waste of life.
We’re all thinking it… tired of seeing people die. These people need to stop being so awful. Ya know what I mean. If the boot don’t fit. Don’t try and make it.
Gun violence should carry an automatic hanging sentence my very strong opinion
LMAO. Things u wont find in europe
The reason for escalation is STUPID! A kid DIED because of a water gun fight? The aggressors parents should have disciplined him more when he was growing up! This is what soft and/or uninvolved parenting brings...
Typical
ladies and gentelman this is america
Them niggas was mad they couldn’t be around the bitches
The leadership wont fix anything, its just a way to make money for themselves while the neighborhoods get worse each year.
I expected it when I saw African Americans this ain’t news no more and it’s not racist it’s the sad truth
Americans...
yall need to get rid of these creatures
dont spray my Jays dawg or else
The guy just entered the club of ppl  whose souls r going to rot for iternity.
Atlanta 😆
Must have been jealous because he never had friends growing up who wanted to have a water balloon fight.
too much fetal alcohol syndrome in the 6lack community
How do stereotypes originate?  ….by stereotypical behavior
https://youtu.be/5lU53gxDRd0
Water #GUN fight everything revolvers around guns
lock his ass up for life, he dont appreciate it.
basketball player moment
Lmao
Can't even have fun with fellow students without fear  of someone losing their mind and going off....
Must be difficult to adapt, having just come down from the trees that is.
Where there's more than 3, I will not be.
Savages... I hate my people sometimes.
what is the motivation ?
POS!!
Shooting someone is not the  answer neither is fighting.
Sad
that is normal ..nothing happen here
Let's be honest, most of them were bound to trade in the water gun for real guns anyway. Same ol same ol
Tragic
You can't expect wild animals to ever act right in public.
It's water and words, man dude is sensitive. Takes a special type of snowflake.
Nothing new
Oh neegas
Where’s sharpton? Where’s blm? Oh, that’s right, this doesn’t fit any of their selective agendas. I had a dream and y’all keep fuckin’ it up! Dr. King
I'm sure the park is already plenty safe, you can't for see bad parenting which results in kids bringing guns to a park, so ghetto
why are they having a water gun fight in the parking lot?
Straight bum, took your shirt off like you tough just to shoot a lil ass gun
Chocolate people at it again!
Damn just trying to have fun in the sun
Murica
How does a water gun fight get deadly u got sprayed in tha face n it hurt 🤔
Imagine having beef from High School 🤣🤣🤣
This is literally the parents fault these kids come out this way. I see it all the time. The parents are the ring leaders. And the kids Cousins and uncles and Aunts all involved somehow too. Thos is normal in the hood cuz hood parents promote this type of trash. Yah want change? Hold the parents accountable cuz it all starts there and at school. Where DCF should be heavil iinvolved. Section 8 and anything staye assistance wose needs to be taken away from these bad parents. But I digress.
Haha, these names. Daequan?
And yet our society will allow him to live.. eat.. wasting time, space, and money.
life in jail to the low life kill agen is block man
blm right?
Punk ass kids can't do it the way we did it back in the day and that was throwing hands but no these punks don't know how so they pull out a gun.
They can’t even have a water gun fight without killing each other!? Wtf
How dumb do you have to be to commit a murder in front of maybe 30 witnesses in the middle of the day 🤔 🙄.  Answer incredibly stupid.
The new generation are a bunch of punks. No brains.no balls. Sad
Only in Georgia man honestly
So a future potential NBA star killed a future potential doctor going to doctor school...
Crank people🤦🏻‍♂️
They have so much hate inside of them
I would rather make my parents proud of me.. Then wanting validation from the block.. Now society is scared of you an the jail has a spot jus for you.  Such tragedy 😢 💔  r.i.p young man  I am proud of you!
No where in America is safe with gun laws as they are. This could happen any time any place.
can anyone have fun and laugh this days without anyone trying to ruin it ???
Only in the hood wow blm doesn’t matter to them
murica
This is why we cant have nice things
So he is a school shooter. Say it how it is.
well Im at High school and students are doing watergun fights in my school every afterschool hours. Hope this doesn't happen to us.
Murica..
neighbors be neighbors
I'm still trying to understand what kind of losers go back to their old high schools to hang out. Talk about peaking early.
Ya can't hold or hide a hand gun right. Then you drop it 😂 at that point you should no guns aren't for you. Then you had to ruin it by killing someone for what? Y'all are so sensitive but are so quick to get a gun and learn the hard way that no one cares about your feelings and your homies are just witnesses. And your family turns to strangers. Good luck with that👍😔
just sad
Guns kill people
What a bitch, had to pull a real gun on water guns.
Too lazy and ignorant to think 5 minutes ahead.
let me tell you about living in the ghetto. you can have fun all you want, but some mfs just don't wanna play, its all ego stroking for themselves. if you ever get in their way they will kill you on the spot. its bs I know but if you want to survive, you have to try the best you can to stay away from ppl like them, they mommas done raised them wrong.
who brings a real gun to a water gun fight .. wow
Wow nobody has hands anymore 5hem basketball boys are some bitchs I hate people man so sad
✊🏿
LMAO
My heart and prayers for the families. So so sad  My condolences 🙏🏿
Always that one person.
Great job America 🇺🇸👌🏼
Punk ass dude
Lock that thug up!
leave it to those type of people
America : Only place in bilions of lightyears with Deadly waterfights. This is sad.
Execute the killer, and life in prison for the rest of the losers who pulled guns on kids playing in the park. No more room for trash in this country, between the inbreds in sheets and the uneducated praising mass murderers the last thing we need is a bunch of child killers.
Nobody should die over a water gun fight but come on, why would you play with someone who is clearly not playing, go play at your house, play stupid games win stupid prizes
It’s sad when u can’t even have a water gun fight anymore with someone dying I miss the the old days when a fighting was with fists people had respect for one another and people didn’t live like they are entitled like they do now everyone is a lawyer doctors or psychologist now days lol times will never be the same glad I got to live the good old years
TBB
My children had water gun fights at church after Sunday School.  Seems to me the basket ball players wanted trouble or why were any of them carrying guns on them.
Look at this dude messing with high schoolers since he’s a looser
This is what happens when invitations to a water gun fight aren’t specific enough.
He didn't care! Right where he belongs!!
It's America everybody
Every bullet shot is money... RIP kid
Such a wicked soul! What in the madness is going on. This is such a senseless murder and so heartbreaking to the family of the slain. If he is man enough to shoot he should be man enough for a death penalty. What nonsense
No code. No morals... Just vanity.
Tired of mentally ill people in the hood, we gotta get help
There are ALWAYS cameras.. even at an outdoor park. Glad justice for served
Thank you God for allowing me to raise my sons in a different generation then this one.. Thank You.. 🙏🙏
Same old group.
Can’t even be a kid having fun anymore
dude that shot is already spending life in prison
Ban access to any guns. End of violence and death.
Man Atlanta is a dumpster fire
There's always that one serious guy.
I'm waiting for Lebron "our people are killed everyday" James to comment on this one...oh a year later and no word? Got it
Lesson learned: dont bring a water gun in a gun fight.
These dummies really think they won’t get caught smh there are cameras everywhere…it’s a classic case of a trigger happy loser…so sad kids can’t even have fun anymore.
Start holding public executions for violent crimes. Maybe it will put a little fear into these young people and make them think twice
More Joe Biden supporters reaping what they sow.
People this is your motivation to make some money and get away from these types of people..
Where BLM on this?
Wow america... I always dreamt of seeing the bity citys in usa as i was growing up. My dad has travelled all around usa too. But these days yeh my dream is just to stay alive. Cant even go have a sick waterfight without some one pulling a gun.
Fake ass thug
Can’t have fun 🤡 9/11 was an Israeli mossad op
Of course he was out there at noon, he doesn’t have a job.
Bro is 20.. tf he doing at a High School.. Bum
Pos thugs
I've just finished watching another video of a man who was shot four times in the chest over grass on a lawn being too long. America is the most pathetic and petty place to live, so many people get shot and killed over absolute nonesense, it makes you wonder if all of this isnt going to explode into full-on chaos in the U.S. at some point
Why they can't ban fucking guns from America I don't get it
Smh don't surprise me. Humans literally could cause war at a peace meeting.
I have the right the bare arms... cmon how is it still legal to own concealed hand guns after so many young people have been killed with them? Does it not bug you at any point someone could end your life before you could even draw your own weapon?... whether or not you have agitated anyone
Jealous punk can now turn homosexual in prison and he can play his disgusting rat game basketball
Wow ignorance is bliss don't some ppl know .If you kill you getting lock up and you brun in hell.
this is what got proof killed
*Animals.  These Biden voters are beyond belief.*
These times are fucking worthless
he had to shoot a senior,  and didnt even have the balls to fight him
BLM is a joke
Leave it to the usual suspects to murder someone over a game kids play.
Why did i get an Icarly ad before this 🤣🤣
This numb nut just shot a happy and well teen that is disgusting Edit: one more thing, he thought he was cool he thought he was a man and he can get girls, but he got life in prison.
This generation here. All of em need 3 feet. 2 to walk on and 1 to kick themselves in the A## with. Silly behinds will be in prison for his life cause in truth, he is a WEAK BOY, not man, BOY.
😂😂😂 poor American got scared of water so he pulls a gun out lmfao this is why America is a failed country 😂😂
Certain groups.  Go figure.
Ummmm woah
There's always gotta be a third partyer
1:48 no I really didn’t SEE any of it cause y’all won’t show what really happened🐖
Cowards.
What a horrendous POS
Looking pretty dark over there
Dialog won't do s**t.
Rap music and parents having oops babies
Ignorant kids...can't fight on the street, no guns down the road gna have to use your fists or a knife
Don't bring a water pistol to a gun fight!
This anchor lady is a stunner
They gotta win the gulag
African water gun fight.
Such a waste of life...
I'm glad he got life in sentence, why the hell would he take a kid's life away.
Wow, you shot someone because you had a fight which was on both sides. Big man here
i love it
Thats why they always say never bring a Colt 45 ACP to a squirt gun fight..
20yr is a adult brain no way he thought this through with a gang of witnesses what??? This was pure emotions
They went from splatoon to call of duty
KNEW it was particular male demographic ‘fore I clicked.  Absolute nuisance to women, children and the society at large. 🤮
Nowadays a simple glance cost a life. having fun can be insulting for others.
Im starting to think that sometimes cops aren't ways wrongfully profiling and actually have suspicions/concerns when they see those types of people (how they dress, act, their body language etc). I could be wrong but I'm seeing more and more of this.
Wtf 😑🤦🏾‍♂️
STUDY NATURAL LAW WITH MARK PASSIO.
im so sorry for them, they were just having some fun
What type of person brings a real gun to a water gun fight among school kids? A thug, that's who.
😂 Only in America
Do the majority of Americans really believe it's a right to own a gun?. So strange is all, our country bought all our guns and destroyed them after a massacre decades ago. Seeing how now only police, those heavily licenced and people quite deep down in the criminal underworld have one, guns are just not something an average person ever bothers even thinking about here, let alone kids.. that should have escalated from water balloon to an apple being thrown
Such a damn fool! Kids and young adults continue to waste and throw away their lives... just sad!
What the hell why couldn't the losers at the basketball court just mind their own business? What has the school kids water fight got to do with them? USA is built different man
K les digo ya es tiempo de Pensar diferente el gobierno tiene K aser Algo o sino un día será Per
Not adding up
What a great group of hard working, young men who do not receive money from the government each month. Respect to them :)
COWARDS…only cowards shoot ppl
Bruh this happened on my birthday
They came for trouble. Kids can't even have fun no more
Give your Kids Welfare names and this is the result. Youve been warned.
They didn’t need to walk over there!
Since when did we get to a piont where a water gun fight can turn into an actuall gun fight
Am I the only person on planet earth who wants to smash his phone Everytime he hears some 🤬🤬 reporter say the word allegedly 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬, you can't possibly allegedly shoot or murder somebody, the reporter should has his income allegedly frozen, see how they like it
You shouldn't mess wit people.
Damn I thought somebody boiled some water and gave each other 2nd degree burns
You want to make the community better get rid of the courts it only bring the worse people out
Always the short mfs 🤦🏽‍♂️
Dont even let the shooter spend life in prison, he can still make a life for himself in there. straight execution.
His music mafxacrash
thats nothing out of the ordinary, dont even know y bother to solve this case, these punk ass teens can buy a gun at walmart and do whatever they fell like
0:38 fills out the stereotype
Damn! Newswoman  in red is HOT!
Wondered where it was until he said the involved names, says it all mm hmm
Ways to make the park safer? It’s not the park thants not safe. It’s the people that carry guns with short fuses that makes parks unsafe.
Dark people doing dark things 😂
Yo this is j crew!
Damn this brings that paintball video of the numerous shots on kid laying on ground...full circle when ppl commented saying he would come back wit the real deal n bang on em 4 what they did to him while he laid in street being pummeled with paint balls...in what appeared to be as here simple fun...which turned deadly....
SEND THEM ALL TO AFRRICKA
What a outstanding community .
Smh God save us how???
Imagine having an EGO so large that makes you want to end someone because they hurt your whimpy feelings? What a pathetic loser. Sick of people who can't handle their feelings and resort to violence. It's called WALK THE F AWAY. Oh well, thugs will be thugs. Certain people just don't want to change at all.
And just like that he threw his life away.
there they go again!
He came at me with a super soaked so I soaked his body in his own blood.
Feel sorry for him :( he wanted to participate in the water gun fight but only had a real gun
Death penalty, no question.
I have no respect for basketball players. Filthy beings. They end up in hell for sure
dark times we live in
uh.... you don't bring a squirt gun to a gun fight...?  RIP girl
Mofos be weird asf pulling guns on ppl fr
Throw away the key and let that pos rot.
Are they all this dumb?
Talk about bringing a water gun to a gun fight.
Another shooting at a school where they were having a water gun ‘fight’ until a real gun was produced....So easy for them to get guns it’s more of the same .....turns deadly because life is so cheap....
Hey guys let me join! Oh wait this isn't a water gun...
atlanta go crazy
The price of sending trash to jail after all is already done: a life
This was planned. So sad. Do something with your children or something will be done to them. Lives lost on both sides.
Only in America do water gun fights turn into real gun fights. Turn water into blood and call it magic. Well done American government and NRA. :)
Need more cops.
That's all them kind know how to do is pull a gun cause the cowards cant fight like men
he aint Caucasian..
Only one word needed.  TRIBESMEN!  AGAIN, 95% of the time.
enjoy prison
Youngstas are out of control just terrible
WHAT kind of homicidal lunatic uses a gun in water fight.  ?!
These crack babies nun growed up
Sometimes it doesn't even feel like serving life in prison or the death penalty is enough punishment. It's scary to imagine how little some people care for their one life, let alone, the many lives they've ruined.
They have perfect shooting stances.
😂😂
people are stupid af
Epic
In Detroit some of the gangs started settling beefs with water guns instead of the real. Guess homies start out with water guns then someone decides they one up with the real...💀
I AM SHOCKED!!
Now had these (mostly peaceful) water pistol fighters been out on the plains of the Serengeti chasing small rodents with pointed sticks all while wearing the latest in animal skin fashion this tragedy never would've occurred.
If you added up the IQ of all these Neanderthals, you'd struggle to reach double digits.
Just more b on b crime, no big deal.
dont worry about injustice, street justice is faster and cheaper.
Imagine taking away someone's entire future over something so petty. Disgusting
Sean Allen got life in prison.  Just so ya know.
Why is anyone surprised by this? Wake up and accept reality.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn! Those BLM, am I right? LMAO!!
Haven't watched video yet but im guessing i know exactly what it looks like. Some wanna be banger got insulted or dissed and decided to shoot it all up. Ill watch and see
Tribal wars out of control.
they were raised to be violent..  need to cage your animals
Who hangs out at their high school after graduating/dropping out..? Am I the only one I finds that odd?
USA culture
And there're still people defending the gun culture in your country
what a donkey bringing a hand gun to a water gun fight
Why would you turn yourself in? I mean you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison either way so you might as well make a run for it
But if it was a cop who pulled the trigger, we all know what would happen.           .                                              We have have investigated ourselves...
what?? how could this be?? he was such a good student and a man of god....hahaha yeah right? hope his ass stays in jail for the rest of his life.
My people doing what they do best. Keep it up my ninjas ✊🏿
FOX5NEWS GANG
Shouldn’t have even been an argument! Mind yo f*ckin business n live your life as the best person you can be. We gotta do better as a society in the day to day when you’re speakin to someone remember they’re a human being too who has most like got a couple things in common with you from the pain they’ve felt to the things they enjoy. Imagine how much we could all accomplish if we worked together. N if you’re thinkin “work together on what”, work on keeping emotions low n logic high when it counts👍🙏 God bless y’all
Guess the ethnicity..
Hahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha...
Some people in the comments seem to believe this a scenario most of the time and that water gun fights have changed nowadays 🤣. But Whether they were using water guns or just listening to music those guys came looking for trouble and were armed.
Only in the States.. Like really
Accident turned into a murderbut if you didn't live by the gun you wouldn't die by if it gone wouldn't doubt it would have been no accident
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3v-pnfJkZE
Only in America
America is out of control
only in america, land of the free
One group has water guns; the other group has bullit guns. Thats messed up.
They blamed everything but the actual criminal. “How can we make the park safer” or “due to dangerous firearms” What about a fkn thug killed a kid?
BLM
HE WUZZA GOOD BOY GE WUZ GUNNA TURNT HE LIFE AROUND OH LAWD
I knew Cobra Kai high school fight was wrong. Noone got shot.
Yay second amendment.20,000 dead american bodies a year😂millions gaoled at great cost weakening your nation🤣 This never happens in australia cos we have gun control
Those people are the reason they being hated
"Didn't do nuffin" strikes again
ALWAYS SOME FUCKING HATER DOING THE SHOOTING
Oh well
how much more stupid are those people gonna get
Burn loot murder should use their millions for these kids rather than electing socialists and filling their  pockets
If he's teenage charge him as adult and take him off the street for good also charge his pals his homies also. RIP dude your angel now.
I have no words just tears. Just sorry this happend.
How did he think that would end. Shouting someone in front of all those witnesses? What an idiot. A moment of anger and one guy is dead and another in jail forever.
Someone’s child is dead and ur talking about dialogue lol really typical brothas u can’t even have water gun fight for em
Or leadership cuts down the basketball poles problem solved full courts go to half than half to none
Gangster wannabes ruin life just to act too cool in life
I hope he enjoys tossing salad in prison
I strongly feel sympathy for the lot of colored people in the US,  but relations  with others and level of crimes will not improve unless blacks with attitude start to change behavior,  of course starting in home environment by parents or caregivers. This is based on my unfortunate and long experience etc...
Them folk wasn't even fuckn with them. They should had kept their hating ass at the ball count
How many PSI are these water guns shooting at?
Well, I mean, you just can't go and disrespect someone and be expected to keep having birthdays...
Improving? Yeah right this will always be the norm
A water-gun fight didn't turn deadly.    A group of thugs, with conscious intent, approached, attacked, and opened fire on a group of teen students who were playing with water-guns on school property.
never relax......
Raised by flies.
Dumb kids worse parents
Easy. Illegal weapon = people has no weapon
Why the hell did you have to do that? Seriously WTF...
Hold up, I thought that park was a gun free zone...
damn this is fucken pathetic it all starts with cowards who dont know how to lose like a man in a fist fight what a coward
Whoopsie,...brough a water gun to a lead gun fight.
I spose somehow this will be the government or a cops fault. BLM
The primary reason behind blanco aviation.
Skin color doesn’t surprise me
"Break yo self foo!!!"
this is all because of gangster culture. all that rap and glorification of violence and sexism and narcissism. it's disgusting, honestly.
The fact that every single dumbass can have access to a gun is what is concerning.
Peaceful peoples
kids cant even have fun without getting shot..
Oh look, it's them again
can't guns be made illegal for under 21's ? Just asking..
We need to go back to medieval times style punishments for people, life in prison doesn't scare people anymore.  You kill another kid in a park, guess what bitch, you gettin the rack...
Yo Doug Evans w t f you doing way the heck out there.
WHAT kind of name is dequan, HaHaHaHa
at 0:18 her smile (smirc). It's not nefarious just thoughtless
Great, now the clowns in D C are going to outlaw water guns and make water gun fights hate crimes.
"hsots were exchanged" does this bozo know what "exchanged" means?
For what.... over literally 😒 nothing....a sham
NEVER turn your back to an aggressor! Don’t fight if you can help it, back away from the situation. BACK AWAY!! If y’all just fought and he/she is still conscious, RUN AWAY asap!! You fight to survive, not to “win”
How big of a coward do you have to be to shoot unarmed people?
Increase penalties for crimes, bring back forced labour hammering train tracks
Code B....
Why am I not shocked anymore?!
You got my Js wet…
I'm from the UK, and I have always looked on Americans as being proud of their country, and proud of their morals. To me, America was all about looking after your neighbour, and standing up for what is right. People like this young man do nothing to support that belief, which is a shame. Unfortunately, America isn't the only country with this problem in some of it's youth. R.I.P to the young man who was shot.
Atlanta is becoming Detroit...Democrats.
Something innocent and fun turns deadly for what reason? I can't see anything wrong with what those kids were doing.
"We'll have a meeting about improving the safety of the park."  What are they going to do?  Ban basketball players? Stop and frisk them before letting them into the park?   This sheriff will do nothing, because he can do nothing. Because doing something would be racist.
but yeah its the cops who are the problem...clearly🤦‍♂
Atlanta’s Bible may be the best! Hopefully they get a whip
Way to make your mother proud Shawn Allen!
Police are gonna have something.  Police cant see ahead always behind.
Water pistol fight turns into a Gunning down of a high school student,  USA USA USA 2nd amendment. Free Carry.  What could go wrong.
Anyone wanna take a wild guess as to why the recourse wralthy area known as "africa" is such a violent shithole and not a happy place?
Murika
LET THEM GET ON WITH IT
America be like :
do we notice a pattern here yet? Low impulse control
I won’t mention anything about the color of their skin.
Animals
🤐
Sean Allen wasn't even apart of the water gun play but thought it'll be fun to start some trouble...... Well now he's in a place he can start trouble all he wants for the rest of his life
R.I.P to the one's that didn't deserve to die and actually wanted to better themselves
Why wasn't this a gun-free zone? That would have prevented this tragedy.
No race baiting
I'm surprised that, with playing basketball with a gun tucked in their shorts, they haven't shot the boys or a foot.
1:40 didn't know Dr. Phil was also a cop.
He’s was such a good boy. He could have been president!
It’s Atlanta, I’m not surprised this happened.
Was it a minority who murders another minority again ? asking for the majority. yawn
Maybe he will see his father in prison at least…
W E W I A O T I T F T E S O O T C W D K I, W I I A T D S I T G A C I D yayy censorship 👹
Have fun in prison, Mr. Shooty.
What color are they?
death penalty
Is he out yet?
...e para variar o assassino era um "moreno"...
Ofcourse a bunch of blacks..
Imagine walking up to people having fun with the intent to start trouble and packing weapons because you know you are willing to take it that far.  I can't imagine that myself.
he brought a water gun to a gun fight
Gangsta
Absolutely no respect for life.
Some people you don’t communicate with, you eliminate them. Plain and simple.
I hope he spends the rest if his life behind bars the pitiful coward!
jogger lives matter!
It's their culture! You have to respect it.
gangster thugs do what they do.  im surprised you people aren't glorifying it
So i guess now we need to ban all water guns!
LOL "...the safety of the park..."  The PARK is just fine ...it's the PEOPLE there that are F'D!!
Started with basketball
Only possible in america™
America you are a joke..... guns guns guns
Life in prison. Now our tax dollars go towards keeping it alive for the rest of it's life. How sad and a waste of money.
I’m so sick of the cowardly boys that are so quick to pull guns and take lives for little to nothing.
over a fucking watergun.
The dropouts led by big stupid.
The only way to  make the park safe is go back one generation and have a parenting 101 class
Youtube really likes to protect these useless degenerates. Cant even say anything about them without getting my comment deleted 😒
How gangster are you when you shoot kids having a water fight my hella
We can't go anywhere. Everywhere we go, we destroy. We destroy eachother, we destroy our neighborhoods, we destroy the streets, the stores, the parks,..... so sad.
You can't help these people.
Coward.
So basically, a guy with a gun instigated a fight so he could pull it out.  Typical chump.
Blame the rap culture.
Why?
Always remember to bring your gun when you go back to your former highschool to play basketball. That's a real man.
bruh
Sorry to say this is one word total barbarian on the loose
What improvements to the park are going to improve safety?  Maybe metal detectors for the gangs playing basketball?
1st: What the hell is wrong with people???   2nd: Did they just say that a "Dropped gun fired"??? Ok Alec....  A dropped gun never fires without the trigger being pulled. NEVER.
The contrast on my monitor is acting up again.
A life for a life i don’t know why ppl don’t believe in that 😒
Remember when our parents were annoyed with us for using roman candles as Wands like something out of Harry Potter, and that was dumb...but this is a whole other level of stupid.
Whenever there's senseless murders like this, I feel like the victims family should be able to personally kill every person living from the suspects family. We need to forget about prison and "the justice system". Have the police wrangle up their entire living family tree and allow and provide the victims family the means to exterminate the rest of the suspect and their family.
Crazy nation too many stupid people with guns.
Meanwhile on Death Row: "Hey man, what you in for?"  "Uhh... Water fight".
BLM LOL
Typical public school products...
Guy definitely looks like someone that would kill a kid over a fist fight. Good riddance. Rot in prison. You wont have no gun to back you up in their bitch boy. Youre gonna find dudes in there that dont need a gun to kill you.
When keeping it real goes wrong.
I am happy to say the park has been assigned... social workers 😊
"Fiery but mostly peaceful"? I'm having to re-learn right and wrong... apparently politics has something to do with it now😔
The difference between Switzerland and the USA is this ... Switzerland: many people own rifles that they use at a shooting range, they are disciplined with them because they mostly got into guns through mandatory military training. They come together at shooting competition in the thousands, even politicians attending. USA: you want a gun? You get a gun. Figure it out yourself. Oh your daddy has a gun already? You talk to him friendly and you got it in your own hands. Veterans? They don't wanna see any more guns. Self defenders? Think they can shoot the gun out of somebody else's hand if they need to.
Look at all of those future astronauts
dont bring a water gun to a gun fight
imagine that....did the shooters mom post a pic of him in the 4th grade and tell everyone what an angel he was and would NEVER harm a fly?
Someone gunna get a thousand dollar bond.
Imagine having such a small ballsack that you kill someone over some water.
Joggers. no need to try and understand
ANIMALS !
Looks like somebody left the ATL Zoo's gates open...
This is somewhat a result of making criminal violence heroic in the eyes of some people. Music culture movies overall attitude of what is cool, manly, popular. We in the USA have had a long history of making criminals stars even heroes. Groups talk about symbols of violence take statues down try to insulate people from reality. We need to develop answers to these problems currently we have training " Schools" that truly do not educate they train for productivity. We have prisons and jail systems that do nothing but herd and control physically the bodies of incarcerated with no real goal besides bottom line and political stances. The worst thing that ever happened to many communities are people like Al Sharpton David Duke Jessy Jackson who take divisionary stances and point blame with no solutions. We tear down statues that can be examples of mistakes and or examples of good work at the same time. Statues are not the problem. Money success and arbitration are the new "Religion". No longer is the idea of do what is right and life will be good. The idea is now get wealth and all is good. Finance needs to be at the absolute bottom of the power pyramid instead of the very top like it currently is. Usery caused this shackling of fellow men for petty gains. I can live without money I cannot live without self motivation. We are all more similar than we are different.
“Former student” 22 years old hanging out at his old high school. That’s pathetic 🤣
How predictable
Got dudes suede  air Jordan 1s wet...
Lmao now he’s getting graped in the bootyhole 😂
They pussies started to tickle when they saw them water guns squirting
Someone must have been 'disrespected'. Damn pathetic.
sad that you just have to get rid of basketball courts to get rid of the garbage humans
I would like to solve the puzzle Pat.
It's all fun and games til somebody's Jordans get wet.
Stupid children. I’m sure those were legally owned firearms..
throw away the key.
murica
I can tell you how to make the park safer.
And just like that, a young man is dead and another has lost his life in prison... all over nothing
WHERES BLM NOW
“I was outside of the school shootin water pistols with my friends when a couple of hoods who were up to no good, stopped shootin ball to shoot my friend dead and my moms got scared and sent me to be live with my uncle in bel air”
That word gun reminds me of America. Nuff said.
Case like this should earn the execution chair, so wannabe gangsters know what is coming.
Gangs and garbage
So basically 1-9 idiots ruin the fun, via impulsive behavior/ bitterness. a YT video is uploaded. then the racist flood the comments and equate the other 20+ innocent kids, to the 1-9 idiots, just because they all share the same skin color. Did I cover all the silly bases?
Never turn your back on a lion and never ever get in a water gun fight with gang members.
Bruh that's the consequences when everyone can have a gun.
GET THESE WATER GUNS OFF THE STREETS!!!
What kinda party pooper does this sorta crap? Glad the shooter is locked away
notice how certain groups of people are more prone to violence - nah you wont open your eyes and admit the truth
Dropped handguns don't generally discharge because of hitting the ground...just saying.
Why do they kill each other
Was this in Nigeria
Always be wary of shirtless packs.
Imagine going to play basketball and carrying guns.
the gunman need to stay in prison for life
Dah news bez raciss n sheeeeiiii
He may have been a warlock who could melt if he had water thrown on him, and so it was a deadlier risk for the perp than people realize............his back may have been against the wall with Super Soakers about.
I guess they don't believe that BLM
He's got a good story for the homies in lock up.
BRING BACK PUBLIC HANGINGS
Damaged goods, stupid and unredeemable.
Death penalty!!!!
Such a vibrant culture. Maybe they need another tv channel dedicated to them or another month to honor their history.
Joggers Gon Jog
The school of higher learning where high school students play with squirtguns and water balloons..HAVE YOU SEEN JR'S GRADES? Education isn't what it used to be.
Scientists:We may have water conflicts and wars in 21st century The water war so far:
Haha this sounds made up, like a Netflix documentary.
The blk community needs better leaders
As always, nobody wins, again.
When water hurts your feelings you need a rolemodel.
They were just being kids until that thug demon showed up and stole that poor kids life, disgusting.
Tried to act cool and now he’s someone’s bottom b for life nice young fresh meat
13% at it again
This is probably one of those "I told you not to shoot me in my damn eye" momens
You know its so damn funny that these "cool kids" always talk about they dont hang around or mess with pee-ons & yet theyre around them everytime picking on them like "why are you bothering me?"🤷🏿🤔🗣always wanna show out in front of friends/some girl for laughs. But when i come with a better joke in front of you/your friends they become the "victim" and starts fights because i defended myself from your actions.  I can see why the gun violence is strong in Chicago for example, there's alot of people getting stepped on and the bully plays victim when THAT victim stepped on them for getting stepped on by them💯
blm
The Park is safe. Some ppl don't practice safety. Can't stop that free will
Life is cheap in America
let us all be politically correct and not call things how they are.
From little italy
Been there
No men to tell them how to a man
Damn.
These youngsters are not able to hold their own with fists, quite sad that the next best thing is a gun,  so final and quite the opposite of looking strong,  only a weak coward does that.
Death penalty.
lmao at the cope. the only way to deal with these violent mongrel thugs is to issue them ALL firearms and let them kill each other off. it'll be cheaper on all tax payers in the long run.
And people wonder why I don't want people like that to live in my town.
Woke up that day, go to play basketball , and now he's charged with murder.  People need to think more, their actions have consequences
Youth! Be a better person. Fight cops that kill without  justification in a court of law. Not in the streets killing each other  !
Children shooting each other great
People are idiots more than ever these days hope he enjoys man ass in prison
There are two types of people who have guns; Those who dread and pray they never need to use them and those who look for an opportunity to use them... The guys from the ball court are the latter...   Ignorance in full bloom...
Blm🥺
Someone heard only gunfight when water gunfight was spoken!
Don't bring a gun to a water pistol fight.
Never relax around….
There is a BLM protest scheduled for this horrific event.  I'm kidding they don't care about their own.
Normal
BLM?
Does anyone else find this part to sound like a tounge twister 0:20
theres always a party pooper
This is the most American thing I've seen on yt. May his soul rest in peace.
Ban water guns 🔫
I swear man this would only happen to a particular culture. No other culture would escalate something so stupid.
I'm glad there were no guns in my school
This sad. But oan them youngins got some nice cars for highs schoolers
Nice culture living in Atlanta.
After seeing the video, is anybody surprised?? I'm not! Happens on the daily!
third world country lmao
easy answer as to what led up to the violence - STUPIDITY
Keep giving everyone a gun, so all the people around could be at their mercy
Big Bubba will be taking care of this kid in prison!
Yup I already know tho one who was shooting was she one who got his ass beat in the fight 🤣🤣💯
Школота.
My opinion but I do believe in eye for an eye 👁 tooth for a tooth period  do to others what u want to be done to you  " the golden rule "  that's the real true law is only fair 😉
open up the death penalty
It’s sad when the youth rather be killers than achievers.
Terrible people man.
It’s a shame these kids want to be thugs instead of business owners
Race
Freaking cowards Is afraid of an   Afraid of an  Ass   Whoop in So they have to use a gun
Raising some great kids!
Murica
Over 2x 100 grand of taxpayer funded education right down the toilet.
Insecure man
This is why more people need guns!!
this is the equivalent of stabbing someone with scissors after a game of rock, paper, scissors
I still can't believe people can just throw it all away... Because they to be tough. You're a fkn 22 yo man!? Find a job! Pathetic. You're living in a "1st world country." Why would you rather live a life of being a "tough guy"?  The best thug and a gangster should be a guy that came from the hardest life, but crawled his way to make his life successful and can do anything to provide for his family.  Not like this...
NEVER BELIEVE MEDIA TELLS YOU....................... COVID 19............PERFECT EXAMPLE
Well that crap went from 0 to 100 real quick
And there goes your future
BLM 👌
Smh
No surprise it's America
Real tough guys....with their guns....Guns make the weak powerful, and the powerful extremely dangerous.
it's always them
Their life don’t matter ig
What is the world coming too?
I’m Shute he got out the next day
This wasn't a water gun fight that escalated,  the deadly altercation didnt have a dam thing to do with the water guns, it had to do with two groups of thugs that didnt mix well.
Ban it... 🔫
wow shocking. thousands of people being racist in the comments
A beautiful day, with fun and love, corrupted by ego and evil.   Damn shame when you see people perpetuating stereotypes rather than putting their energy into defying them.
Sounds like Zoolander gasoline fight accident before one of the male models decides to light up a cigarette  before realizing it was too late. My goodness. Can't have fun in life without a fool acting up to ruin a good day for everybody.
Imagine if meme and social media comment is in real life, there will be bloodshed everywhere,
Day by day instead of learning how to move on from something like back then, people escalated small problem into bigger one
Only at America
Only in USA. XD God left the states long ago.
Why are there no riots?
Escalated when the blake kids showed up... Ougada bougada
This looks like a classic BLM case!
Only Americans
Where’s BLM now lol
This is what I expect to happen everytime I go to the USA.
shouldn't have stopped slavery
When the game has upgrades and there extremely unbalanced with originals
Usual suspects
Only in America where water gun fights turn into deadly shootings.
Too much rap music not enough church
America number 1
Well now, he can have fun rotting in his cell wondering why he cared about things that didn’t matter
Pack of cowards with guns.......GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!   SMH
Let em...
Get rid of your guns America, your too stupid and violent to have them.
Your not news fox, close up shop.
Too bad the Gun is not apart of the school curriculum, Ol Shawn could have learn what that GUN now has caused him.
Wtf is a 20 year doing messing around with HS students? Like bro, move on...
Maybe don't give guns to everyone eh america? Make it harder to be able to buy and use one, and not by reducing the stores that sell them but don't Americans have some sort of patent for guns? Unless all these events happen with illegal gun owners
He brought a squirt gun to a gun fight. Kids these days. Just love ‘em!
Only in America could a water fight turn into a gun fight 🤦
People just need to grow up, turning a water fight into a gun fight. Lool seriously people, stick together and earn money together,  stop killing each other.
Was Alex Baldwin there? Water gun may have accidentally had a live round
You know I always thought it be cool to have a water gun or a cake fight with a group of adults. Maybe not anymore.
Y'all killing each other and for what!!!?? For a couple of idiots to say "u got my respect" .??? Such a pointless thing Every generation does .
Many years ago when i was in high school we had a similar water fight at hico park in jackson ms. I remember a girl pull a gun out because someone shot her hair and her hair got wet!!!!!! At a water fight! I guess she was just there to try to look cute.  That was the craziest thing to me till i saw this story.... rip
He'll make a nice husband in jail for life
Bro woke up and said “I wanna rot in jail for majority of my life.”
So the whole group of basketball players should get life, no parole, according to recent precedent in GA, amirite?
Neanderthals use violence. Men use their brain. That moment of rage was totally worth the life sentence, right?
They all support #BLM and that’s what matters…. Yea… I’m that guy…
No no the US doesn’t have a problem with guns
whos doin the subtitles they don't match
Arm extended gun in hand, levitating above the ground
A park you never want to visit. All punks
america
Damn shame..RIP
Pathetic
good god take away america's guns honestly nowhere in the world do bullets fly for such stupid reasons
It’s just insane to me that people’s egos can drive them to do something that will ruin their whole life. (Aswell as another’s)
Remove the firearm remove the problem.  Why Americans need to be able to carry around firearms in the first place is beyond me.
This is why America needs moar gunz. If everyone had a gun, a good guy with a gun would have solved the problem by throwing gunz at it...
BLM
Too much freedom of expression, through guns...
Shooter was big mad he was a flunky with no friends to play with. Probably was trash at basketball too.
Guns don't kill people, waterguns kill people.
Never relax
Something seriously wrong about our cultures here in the USA smh.
Today's generation seems hopeless.
Insane killing somebody after an argue.
BLM baby BLM
NEVER RELAX...
"You can see the kids having fun"  Uhm.. all I see is blurry blobs
Some generation there's f****** stupid.
Water gun fight turns deadly because these kids don’t have leadership models in their life. What a disgrace to humanity.
That’s weird, coincidentally I saw a post talking about how the basketball community is violent…
Shot not because of the water gun fight. I wonder what type of beef he had with them.
Don’t take a watergun to a gunfight.
Only in America can a water fight become deadly
"How dare these kids have a fun time. Let's kill one of them." Good lord...
Sad af.. teens just playing around and silly mfers show up and act tough in groups and with guns. You curb this type of violence when you start killing these peiple when they are found guilty of reckless crimes like this
Some people got no chill
How is it still alleged if it’s actually on camera?🤔
He dead in prison rip learn lesson
Man when I lived in America everything was intense and racial, glad I moved out.
Gee, such shocking behavior.. Who would ever think that this would ever happen with these kind of people.
everyone talks about condolences but no one talks about finding that POS and putting him in the ground
Now i know why america government allow their people for having guns for no reason. Population control 👍
Wow Atlanta seems violent. I wonder why
To bad he was born in USA
that red Camaro did a nice donut there
This doesn't help blm very much. Tough guy huh, go to prison where you belong.
Bet...Dudes gonna go write one song in jail and get out and be  atlantas next biggest rapper..
Sometimes the way you look say everything. The crime start home!
Nick Cannon was right, I can see how melanin makes you better and more carrying. 🤣🤣🤣💩
It’s the culture, prove me wrong…
Sad minds.. wow. Just be youthful and happy. I don't normally blame movies or games, but i bet the game Grand Theft Auto has a lot to do with kids these days literally disregarding human life. Is the world getting worse or has it always been this way? ...it's getting worse.
Give him the death penalty
BLM where y'all at?
Wasn’t the water gun fight encouraged at some point by one of the leftist cities leaders?  Great job as always. Let’s go Brandon.
Guns here and there. Everyone owns guns. Expect results
Guys, you need more guns. It's so sad that this happened. Just imagine if EVERYONE had a gun? How am I supposed to enjoy my bowl of spaghetti with this mediocre display? I really expect more from the American people. More entertainment in particular. (For the slow people: Me no serious)
someone really wanted to win
We have to do better people
Woooow 🤦🏾‍♂️ the killer don’t like water huh??? I guess the killer definitely ain’t get no water in prison either
This had nothing to do with the water fight. They just wanted to use the "gun" word.
"Shots were exchanged..."  I thought one group only had water pistols... 😒
This had NOTHING to do with water guns morons 🙄 obviously it was about something else probably drugs, money, or even disrespect that’s all it takes with these kids
America
Welcome to america
Blm
The insecurity of most youth today...knows no bounds.
God bless 'merica
Surprise surprise
Ten second thrill of ending someone's life to being locked up for life🤔  Nah freedom allday, but i'm amazed too many morons disagree😩😭
come to India people I'm 24 years old living in Mumbai never seen gunfire in my life I swear.
I guess this is Trumps fault
I'm absolutely shocked they looked the way they did. Absolutely shocked.
Now the only ballin he will be doing is on his chin, in his boyfriend’s cell
2 Timothy 3:1-5,13 KJV This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.   [2] For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,   [3] Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,   [4] Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;   [5] Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.   [13] But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
The irony
Bruh toxic ppl are the best I enjoyed the drama
Typical,,,,, no one's safe
Notice the color
“N’s”. Say no more!!!
avoid to death: no bad words, no shoot.
strange times we live in
Only in America
Where BLM?
if only one person fired how is this a gun exchange?
WTF's wrong with people?
Just Poc havel8ng a friendly game of gun fight hahaha
Atlanta. Aristocrats and trash
How do you play basketball with a strap?
Reminds me of my neighborhood 🤷🏿‍♂️
Yeah that guy showed them how hard he is... Real cool killing kids bro
this is so wrong
Must be a cops fault, right? Because we don't blame the criminal, we blame society.
🗑🚮
Boomers don't understand the struggle nowadays. We living in the hood. You can't play with water balloons outside no more cause it's unsafe.
"I TOLD YOU MY MOM SAID I CANT GET WET"
Let him use the *I thought I grabbed my water gun* excuse since cops can say they thought they grabbed their razer
kids with guns, kids with guns,
Wow some people kill for the wrong reasons. America were we shoot first and don't care after hahaha.
“momma ain’t raise no bitch” yea uhuh
House Party in GTA San Andreas
Murica so funny. LOL
The basketball players are the high school rejects.
weird. never seen that before
Why would anyone bring a squirt gun to a gun fight?
Rip Jorge fentanyl Floyd
Thats how crazy the us are.....
What led up to the violence? People have no fuxxing sense that's what 😒 and now 2 lives are over, one dead one goes to prison, meanwhile everyone there is traumatized and some now have dead and or incarcerated friend. All over nothing more than people puffing their chests and acting tough. Pointless
Wonder why are they saying the killer is Bla.Ck when it doesnt fit the narrative
Jogging much?
Great that everyone has a real gun in usa. Great country to live in.
"The basketball players" 🤣
Why does he own a gun though
Standard day in the USA...
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow They'll learn so much more than I will ever know I think to myself.. what a devillish world..
Can’t even have fun anymore smh
Says these gangs need to get with each other and go to a paintball field and just bat mad cash on who wins
Give him the death penalty who cares maybe then will he not act tough and value life more
hes that wet to shoot someone.....there has to be a reason behind this....rest up to that young brother
Onley in Amerika!!
Can’t have no fun
That's why we can't have nice things God damn it 😒
Water guns dont kill unless its tainted with mercury
the title should change:a group of gangs (A)practice shooting with each others but another enemy gang(B) found them and killed a member of the people in the gang(A)
Haters
I’m sorry but our society has fuckin lost it. Kids do this kinda stuff we have nightmares about. I’m afraid to have a child for fear it will shoot me in the head during my sleep from snapping mentally because of a school bully.
This is America
Only in America
Y'know when rapper rap about killing someone, it's not real, it just a lyric that rhyme
had nothing to do with the water fights. one group came in and antagonized the kids playing and it escalated.
Wow
Lmao WTF lol
Allegedly
Looks like childish gambino
Insecure much?
IDIOT HUMANS   GROUPS  ARE THE MAIN PROBLEM   WE ALL SAME BLOOD RED
Now the scumbag coward murderer can have water fights in the prison shower.
Despite
turned himself in? so basically he was just another high school wannabe gangbanger who thought it was just a game and then realized his actions have consequences
Banned water guns!
Haha surprised?
We wuz kangz
That kid lived his life to be a senior 😔
Group? Looks more like a pack to me.
I got $20 on no father in his household. Any takers?
USA, the greatest country in the world! So many tragic events and yet they still insist on having the right to own firearms as constitutional rights. Simply ban it! It's simply politics and money that continues to put guns in civilians' hands! In a country that almost half of the people still voted for Trump, can you trust any civilians with firearms?
I can't imagine living a life where you have to go BACK to the school you already graduated from to continue picking on students.
why
BLM real quiet on this.
Only in America
Current and former clayton county high schoolers . HAAAAAAAAHAAAAAA   He meant straight up  THUGS showed up
Just sad... people are so dumb and animalistic it's disappointing and embarrassing at the same time  to say we are on top of the food chain.
Didn't even have to look to see who the suspect is....
Blm tho?!
This is why we need water gun controls.
Water gun fight turns INTO GUN FIGHT!!! 😅🤣😂😅 HOW F****** IGNORANT CAN YOU GET!!!!!!YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHT UP 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know this sounds mean.. but its best to stay away from certain types of people..
I'm glad I didn't grow up in this generation.
What will the onion come up with next?
How in the world did it turn from a water fight to a gun being used?  Sad and disgusting. And how in the h## do so many of those kids have actual guns?
Ahh america
Take every person that came from the basketball court, the came as a mob and escalated this to be a murder charge. WTH Atlanta? Are there any humans there, or are they all monsters?
That could be one of Obama’s sons
what a shitty world we live in
Takes a big man to pull a pistol and shoot another man holding a water gun
Just look at the demographics but nobody will say anything about it.
Makes me wonder what he does when it rains.
Let's talk about the elephant in the room, I know yall see that big a$$ elephant sitting in the corner over there. Our communities are filled with monsters just like this......Sooooo what are we gonna do about it?
Hope this wicked man was arrested
Blm.. They must have forgot.
These kids all need to be disciplined.  Not the ones with the water guns but the low class scum of this earth.  We don’t need dialogue we just need the would be trouble makers taken care of swiftly.
Ban guns
Prison is the answer for these people, because you can’t fix stupid.
Plain and simple Don't involve people in your pranks if your not willing to die
oh BLM right?
more guns, America needs more guns on the  streets...
And people still want guns to be legalized in my country, utterly insane
The whole group that walked up should do life in prison. They knew what was gonna happen. They should be taken away from the mom and dad just like the person they all set out to kill.
😀
This is why we can't have nice things...
Who brings lead to a water fight?
i could say SOOOO much but I wont. One thing I can say is the suspect will spend many nights in the arms of people who will truly love him daily once found guilty...
These animals who drew real guns need to be locked up, permanently.
Low self esteem + gun = ...
Assault people and get shot that’s Mercia
I don't insult or fight people in our outside of water gun fights, because that is all a water gun fight is.
Mysterious cut of footage so there is even a story out of ordinary. "Turn into punches thrown", which you don't get to see.
GPA, raised.
BLM
Cowards
Probly just more fake news
Life in prison for that kid. Music to my ears.
Americans and their guns, get over it
You live by the sword you die by the sword , one less for the police to worry about ....
What a waste ,it's pathetic
I think its one those pranks again
beware of such 'groups'. Cross the road when you see them. Walk in the other direction and secure your valuables.
Lmao american moment
Yeee haa, good ol USA.
Only in America.
Can journalists stop with the "allegedly" ? He is on camera shooting the gun !
Country with easy gun , so much violence
Water
Typical suspects
"There are ongoing efforts to make the park safe for the people" . I'd start by increasing the age required to buy a weapon. This is crazy,  it's legal for them to use a weapon that can take a life before its legal for them to drink.
Someone used pee water
How
whenever we play water balloon fight, it always ends up in a fight breaking out, we end up throwing rocks, filling balloons with muddy water / stone..
Wow. Can't even play with super soakers without stupid mfs turning violent
Rad
blm
This is terrible! Earlier today I saw a video on how someone was shot over a movie thearter seat to see spiderman.. come to think of it, it was Fox5 Atlanta too. Sad..
Simply theres people that dont play around
What a fine product group
America is sick and shall be healed, blessings from Europe.
How do expect to gain respect acting like this? You are destroying gains achieved by those nice protesters.
Usual suspects
Rotten menace to society
Smh...just scum...cannot believe that. R.i.p 😔❤
Imagine thinking cops are the issue lol
Cowards .......
What happened to high-school?  I graduated 2012 but damn, I remember a quick fist fight and then a blunt later
This culture is disgusting and needs to change
Goes to show you to NEVER play or anything like that anymore. NEVER PLAY AROUND!!
In the future this kid could have been a celebrated leader, a surgeon that helps hundreds of people, a successful enterpreneur or simply a great family father. All taken away in seconds. So sad.
keep selling guns at walrmart's ;)
Disliked for disinformative title.
Thumbs down 👎 DISLIKE
What a weak and ill minded person, throwing real gun to show dominance, but proof stupid and a fool for settling things with violence
Now days in the USA you can get killed just for saying "hello"
So the water fght wasn't really related to the gunfight? I was expecting from the title that a water fight participant got angry.
Welcome to Atlanta.
Reason why people can't have nice things
America.. guns everywhere.
Has zero to do with a water gun fight but make it out like that for clickbait.
Correction! Gun fire wasn't exchanged. Water vs lead
Foos a bitch for shooting
Definitely not a cultural issue.
Probably they have never heard about BLM movement?
"Former student" = loser who only hangs out with highschool kids. Never graduated but still goes to school.
Don’t bring a gun to a water gun fight
Take it for what you will idc, but I'm telling you right now you can't make a place like that "safe" juuust saying. And I'll just leave this here
Culture.
Silly joggers, get it together
Where is AL , Jesse , and Ben at!?
Dude deserves life in jail
BLM is silent 🤫
play stupid games win stupid prizes. darwinism strikes again
Sometimes life makes me sad but then I remember I'm not the dude with a murder bid from a water balloon fight. Wow, guy 😕
Lock His Ass Up!
Wtf is wrong w this culture!!!!
Basketball Americans
Dumb little boy. Where is his girlfriend
Wait it isn't legal for a 20 year old to have a hand gun. How could this happen??
Former students? Please..drop outs at best.. Felt the need to thug it up likely over the girls there..just a guess..it would be sad if not so gd predicable..
Shawn Allen was sentenced to life. 2 lives gone for nothing.
Poor America, full of total crap
Fucking BLM cant even have a water gun fight
It is so sad how violent Atlanta is. Literally anything can turn deadly there even something so innocent. Place is hell on earth
Just saying. I notice a commonality in many of these situatuons
These medical students have such pent up anger. The future leaders of our great country.
Wtf?
Diversity empowered that gang of doctors to kill each other. So brave, so diverse, they will replace us
Can't tell by the video but what kind of group was it?
I’ve heard Atlanta is a shithole
Damn shame.
This is the product of single mothers raising hyper emotional sons
Maybe if they put up gun free zone signs  it wouldn't happen.. duh
the dude even looks brain dead, just sayin.
what a 3rd world country
this is why we don't have open carry in every single state, it would be more deadly than this, nothing is more dangerous than a person who is trigger happy with a gun.
I’m from Spain and I always dreamt to go and live in U.S.A,  but watching these news makes me feel really uncomfortable.  Poor kid….
I'm going to guess that "former student" means dropout.
Look who is involved is there any shock
In prison This "tough guy" will soon become "devirginized tough guy/lady-dude"
Skinny jeans era and super sensitive emotions. Feminizing of men in full swing
I can say why this happened but my comment will get removed due to rrcccci..s..mm.  😆
Bro y over a water gun fight dude could not fight
Failing students had to ruin someone’s life
...and why wouldn't a water gun fight turn deadly? Isn't that what happened when you were young?
His p**** kids nowadays don't know how to settle anything with their fists. Everyone's a coward now and needs a gun
China doesn't have these b.s.
Nothing will change unless you make an example
Plat twist: Student: We have a water Gun battle would you like to join us? Shooter: Brings out a real gun Student: We said Water Gun battle!  Shooter: Guns are GUNS!!
And let me guess the thug murderer will have parents saying what a good kid he is they are found guilty they should die swiftly
A 20 year old kid loses his temper during a innocent water gun fight cannot be called a man he is an ignorant child
Lmao. We wuz kangz
anybody else get a water gun ad?
What a dummy.
Biden’s america 🙌
how many months of probation do you think the murderer will get at sentencing?
This is so sad, like why?  Okay you dont like it leave you have to grab a gun and cause a life...
If only the young thugs would shoot crooked politicians instead.
Another BLM poster child...
When having a gun normal thing...
death penalty..and in 3 days for a cold blooded criminal..dont give them a chance to live for a long time cause they didn't give their victims the same treatment
I'm really starting to really not like the people of my culture. Good thing I'm moving to mars🤣
One word - America.
We need more guns
Hold up . This sheriff actually said 'Guns were drawn and gunfire exchanged...' .  Um, unless they are not telling the whole story, is he saying the students were also armed with firearms , drew them and fired them at the ex-students also ??....
Now i don't live anywhere near USA and for me a gun near highschoolers is just a stupidity of everyone and i mean everyone. That should not be even possible! wtf is wrong with you all?!
Lol keep on playing pranks 😈
One word. Animals.
I know a way to make the park 100% safe, but people aren't going to like it...
There’s always that one person who has to ruin it for everyone
Fragile ego and dangerous person is a horrible combination.
This is like one of those stories you would say but then wouldn’t believe.
Change your title smh
What a loser killing a dude over a water gun fight
Education couldnt even teach these kids life lessons.Whats the use of high infra state of art best in world education when you cannot even teach your students the basics of life.
BLM nowhere to be seen of course
BLM right guys?
From a water gun to a real gun 🤦🏻‍♀️
I don't get it nowadays people rather rot in a cell than be free in the life
is this a joke?
You dummy ... you never bring a water gun to an actual gun fight
Loser can't do anything without a gun
When you have a gangbanger friend
yea unsurprising behavior for those people
"Basketball players "
BLM goes missing when the murderers are of a certain color
Pu ss ies.
Guns don't kill people, animals do
when pure socioeconomic factors caused you to shot kids that were having fun
#BLM This is maga country!
Merica
This should’ve never happened
Can’t even enjoy the most basic of human rights can’t even play and have fun
wow the decisions people make are so silly.... if you are near people who talk or act in a way that is cruel or violent... maybe remove yourself from their presence and avoid them forever. this is what happens when you or friends are toxic.
Us badly needs arm's act .. it's becoming miserable day by day
Send that piece of crap and his buddies all to prison for life and the shooter and his buddy who gave him the 2nd gun straight to the electric chair.
They should tell the prison he's a Chomo let them handle it
African-American "thug" culture really shows how insecure some of people are
He was disrespected.
A water gun fight at a bigger event was how Bugz died  RIP
What a coward
Looked like a bunch of valedictorians out for a jog 🤷‍♂️
What kind of idiots take a water gun fight to those levels? Nice culture!
Shits normal
God why do people have to be so dumb always someone that has to shot someone over nothing.
Avoid large groups of these teens for your safety
I dont like the death penalty but this. This is my exception this year
damn, with a water gun fight? those are so much fun!
america moment
Your 20 why you even have beef with highschoolers. Grow up man. I guess prison will give you time for that.
easy to obtain weapons. senseless deaths everywhere.
I'd like to solve this puzzle..........
We’v all been there! A playful fight with water pistols then someone gets carried away and pulls a glock out
Unlucky
America . . . shhhhh!
I guess blood is thicker than water!
It’s almost as if they weren’t actual people but primitive vessels for demonic entities.
Back in high school every year we'd have a whipped cream fight and simply smear whipped cream all over peoples faces and stuff. It wasn't until a freshman got mad he got smeared and beat a dudes face with a can of whipped cream and broke his nose and whatnot. Then it got banned. Senior year I wasnt even able to smear the underclassman at the end of the year.
Purely socioeconomical factors
just keepin real yall
Wonder why this is happening nowhere else in the world but the U.S.
Ahh just another day in America 👍
Always a certain demographic though eh? Happy New year.
One of BLM’s ✊🏿 hero’s!?
I read nothing but peaceful respectful comments and then nothing but stupid comments. No one should be carrying to beging with. All these guns are stolen etc etc... That's bull you didn't know your child had a gun c'mon people its best to slap your own kid around than to have him dead or taking someone else's child period.  Oh these streets are tough yayaya i lived in plenty of areas like that and if you carry you'll later be buried or judged for it
Americans
Hold all the gangster rappers and companies that profited for last 30years accountable!!!! Brothers that listen to RandB or any other music don't walk around acting hard, willing to shoot another soul for anything
At some point society has to ask, "What commonalities do we see in this video?"
thank god you guys are equipped with weaponry from head to toe to fight the goverment and self defence at any moment, god bless america
This is why if there is alien life, we don't deserve to meet them.  Humans ae trash.
Lol ball players can't fight they weak
WORDS ARE JUST WORDS!!!!!!!!  How pathetic do you have to be as a human being to A) fight over words or B) FUCKING KILL SOMEONE OVER WORDS 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Allegedly u have the picture of him with the gun in hand pointing it at the victim but some how its Allegedly
only in america
Somebody didn’t get the memo. Water guns not hand guns.
only in america. Playing with water guns, gets shoot. Here in balkans you could walk with a real gun and no one will really bat an eye since no one will go shooting random innocent people
Teenage Males and Females:  Having Senior year fun with an innocent water fight  Dirty-sweaty dudes that’s too old to be in school:  Come up with guns for some bs reason  Whether it’s a club, house party, or a park, it’s always the “jammed up” dudes with no girls that like to start sh**.  Be able to recognize them, and stay away or get away from them!
Nothing new
Reminds me of when Chucky switched the paint ball bullets with real bullets for a cadet mock battle match leading to alot of casualties.😬
0:44 guy hanging in mid air with gun visibly pointed at another person who is dead now….reported as “allegedly shot” 🙄 maybe he didn’t shoot that kid 🤔
Dear children/teens of the world. God gave you a brain for a reason. Use it! THINK before you decide to throw your life away. I mean seriously stop and THINK!! Let this be a shining example of what NOT to do. It's just not worth it!
0:16 "what let up to the violence"?  No father's that's what.
Why am I not surprised
F'in ANIMALS!
I just hope they were all wearing masks.
Hope that wanna be thug spends a long time in prison
“Allegedly” shot him. Hell it’s on video.
Bringing a gun to a water fight…..🤦🏾 “You kids these days are nothing but punks, sissified”  If you can’t fight, just say that. Senior gets killed by a 4th year freshman….
America in a nutshell 🥜
Bring back the guillotine. Time to start making examples of these murderers...why should my tax dollars feed, house and give medical care to these animals for the rest of their lives?
But I'm sure it's the gun's fault.  Tragic.  Lock the shooter up for decades.
If found guilty of murder maybe the person should be subjected to the same thing they caused, in this case being shot to death.  I find this fair and people would think twice.
Don't worry Biden/Harris will bail that loser out and give him a medal for being brave standing up to a deadly water gun made by racist.
One day in high school this group of kids drove by threw some signs my friend throws a rock at car doesn't even hit it about half a block down the road a kid I went to school with at the time jumped out alone waiving a gun around we turned and ran no doubt that decision to run saved a life or 2 that day
Those basketball bitches are the loudest yelling BLM BLM BLM..
That country is so screwed up
Someone didn't get the email, don't bring real guns to water gun fight! 😕
The state of USA nowdays... sad. God bless all those that wish to make it a better country.
Cultural.
I mean look at his face.. that tells you enough.
It’s not poor kids you damn well know it’s all gang related .. just say it.. and how got the bigger balls open you’re blind eyes people !!!!!wake up !!!
USA and their citizens have left this world for a loooooong time now..
SAD! Dudes roll up on some kids playing watergun fights and draw on them? What a bunch of pansies. Kids getting super soft these days. RIP to Dequan Gillette and thoughts and prayers to his family and friends. ALSO, to the total clown Shawn Allen, you are a special kind of soft. You draw a gun to intimidate someone and then drop it and shoot yourself???  You then grab another and shoot someone to make up for it??  You still a clown.
Dont start none, wont be none
Eh fits the stereotypes
You guys should all be ashamed. 2022 and cant have a water balloon fight without a person dying doesnt even sound real.
I feel so lucky to not be born in America
America moment
No comment.
everybodyy a gangsta until a guy with an actual gun show up
Unga bunga
Someone always has to let their ego get away from them...
Only in America would this happen. Place is a cancer on planet earth
BLM
BLACKLIVES MATTER 😏😏😏
There's always one that ruins the fun
Some animals just need to be put down....
Sad bro
Atlanta is weird for that why are two different school in the same area or why are the graduated kids coming back to there old school. Weird ass vibes. And I ain’t never had no water gun fight as a high schooler
They use acid as water?  That's nice
did she just say 20 year old “man” he still a kid
Honor students
America...
Ahhh Atlanta where a water gun fight turns DEADLY
It is so pathetic that someone was murdered because of a water fight. People like the shooter need to kill their own ego before acting upon its stupid pride. Stop taking yourself so seriously, just walk away for fucks sake.
not a fkn WORD from BLM protesting or telling their people to change their mentality
Wood chipper.
He need to be put under the jail. He looking bad ack bad but don't want fight
Just like L. J. Said, We’re out there hunting everyday.
That’s why they fight for there second amendment what kind of country let’s any fool walk around with a gun and just because someone has had a bad day they take it out on someone innocent like I hate them kids in school no problem ima shoot their ass tomorrow  Oh I hate my boss ima shoot his ass tomorrow  Oh I hate my work mates ima shoot his ass tomorrow  Oh I hate life ima shoot anyone tomorrow  That’s what’s happening in the USA
Doubt this had anything to do with the water guns. Most likely it was two groups who had prior drama and saw the opportunity to handle it.
Throw your guns away you weak dogs. Fight like a man or not at all.
#Blm
You goin to jail now
certain demographics. once again proving they cant have nice things
What people don’t understand is that you are not a gang or a mafia when you just take your gun and shoot somebody just like that.
america's so fucked up its quite unbelievable sometimes
Amerika and waepons sad!
Tenía que ser un ya-saben-qué.
Kids dont realize just because you have a gun doesnt mean you should act above everyone else and start fights.
USA needs to ban guns
Dis is so American thing
americans LOL
It’s a shame you can’t have fun anymore.
My guess is it was supposed to be a gun fight, but some people accidentally brought water guns.
damn.. dude was just having fun with his friends 😔
BLM tho huh
*a ninja moment*
Bottom line is how the children are raised, guaranteed my son or daughter wouldn't be carrying a pistol around while in high school. I blame the parents, they are the reason the high schooler died.
The news anchor she's a little distracting
Yeah they finna get you in jail
HE HIT HIM WITH THE SQUIRT BUT HE GOT THE SMOKE
looks like proudboys and oathekeepers again--get real MSM--want to know who is killing minorities--just put this video on loop--thats who.
How'd he get a gun? The report didn't specify if the weapon was illegally obtained.
welcome to somalia
Blm... blm....blm niggas
Good thing they were diverse. Good to have representation here.
thats 101% american story
It’s pathetic how kids are so afraid of getting a good ole fashion ass whooping they gotta pull a guns like cowards.
Rip too the deceased.  Also if you gonna have a water gun/balloon fight don’t do it in a parking lot around cars. That’s just disrespectful and asking for trouble. Possibly what sparked the confrontation
America
Ghetto ass urban areas this what happens nothing new here folks
And that video I see recently... Them paintballing each other with guns n they think itl reduce real guns deluded
Rest In Peace to the victims
I don’t get it, do people like to spend the rest of their lives in jail? Not get any from a women, eat good food, live a life they want. They would rather spend that time with a bunch of dudes in a cage. Smh
Take the knee
There is no such thing as having fun, a joke or a prank with "POC".  They have an extremely short fuse that anything can easily turned on deadly for no reason.  And they wondered why other race are scared of them??
alternative cultural norms
That couldn't have been the shooter because he went to church, wore glasses and smiled in pictures
I just wouldn't live there
Mf really shot a kid because of some water fight what a dumbass reason
If guns weren't so easily accessible, this wouldn't happen on a daily basis. Just my opinion from Canada where we have strict gun laws and this rarely happens.
How many Americans have seen a gun held by someone who is not a police or army officer?
Not that tough anymore....
This is what blm is suppose to be mad about if they are even a bit legit. But responsibility isnt in their vocabulary.
R.I.P BRO
This is why I don’t say BLM
Well done america! Again guns and kids.....
Look at the race, nothing new here
I’m sure ego and peer pressure was a key factor
💧 🔫🌚.     🙍🏿‍♂️.  🏃🏿‍♂️💥🔫🌚
New information on what lead up to the violence : someone got wet?
p.o.s. should have stayed on the basketball court. I blame the parents also there encourage this victim mentality to feel ok with this
Dropouts killing kids... this is America right now.
thank god kids weren't pussies like this shooter when i was in school because we had watergun fights all the time in HS if you spray the wrong person you might have the catch a fade but ain't nobody trying catch no murder charge over water
People are so scared to fight these days with their hands it’s not even funny, it’s sad, so called tuff people need to pull a trigger to win a fight, not only do you lose that fight you lose your life to prison, was it really worth it? Id!ots
I very much doubt this is the first time he shot and wounded, or killed, someone. The way he holds it and all.
Watergun fight turned ignant....
Oh, dear!  Just another shooting statistic.  If gun ownership in the U.S. was regulated he would probably still be alive.
Joggers, we all hate them.
We can't even have water gun fights. Ignorance is extremely dangerous, why even bring an actual pistol to a water gun fight? Fear. He's a scared child posing as a man, he has zero self control and discipline. No regard for life, these ignorant men are weak and dangerous.

Fatherlessness is the real pandemic.
what a coward
Pepole who do sensless killing should all face the same stip tht they are being charged with. Dude needs to be done in by a firing squad.
Sad. Lock the murderer in jail for life....na go with the death penalty.
But they are such good boys! They were all aspiring rappers, they just wanted to play a game of basketball and then they were off to church! After that, they were all going to apply for jobs. Since none of them have one!!!! Smfh
Cultural problem.
The killer will be surrounded by half naked men for many years after this. No more nana, homothug. All these “killers” are secretly “fruity” and can’t fist fight.
This channel censors comments, cool
Wtf
murica, sucha  fkd up place.
What in the world......
Mental health and guns
Bro what a scum bag, him and his friend.
It´s obvious, the killer was a:  Not Inspiring Great Guy Ever Risen
He was recently sentenced to life.
This new generation is Gona ruin it for everyone there not the only ones guilty there’s my generation as well that can’t act right and settle things without killing or acting hard   My heart goes out to the family and kid.  It’s a  cruel World we live in and it’s only getting worse  Godbless us we need it
This is what happens when you romanticize gang culture
Oh look! It’s another one of those “people who annoy you”      What a surprise 🙄
This is all wrong
What race were they? Rhetorical question... We all know the ignorance behind this
If you teach your kids to be violent they will grow up to be violent!
So… what was the point of this?  Need to take his life as well. A life 4 a life.
My sincere Condolences to this young man’s family who lost his life because of a POS with a gun…
You people are cowards by nature.
They came all the way from the basketball court to mess with some kids enjoying their youth.   Holy hell.
Joggers gotta jog!!
Why they having a water balloon fight in a parking lot full of cars. Of course the owners of the cars are gonna be pissed.
Ban water guns!
It’s blood affiliation. He asked “who you be”.
🤦‍♂️
That news lady is drop dead gorgeous 😍
Do this story "Dr" Rashad... We Kno why u won't tho...
When I was younger we use to be able to have water gun fights and just have fun. Kids nowadays are so lame and ignorant. I fear for my young ones.
REALLY?, Just shows you how pathetic some humans can be.  BLM 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Maybe they should tell themselves that.
then if someone had ran over the shooter(s), they would have to go to jail as well... this country makes no sense when it comes to law enforcement. RIP to the lost soul.
Imagine trying to be a tough guy during a water gun fight
"Fatherless children" that's what happened
You gotta hate ya life to kill somebody over nothing and spend the rest of ya life in prison. Smh community gotta do better man.
When you bring a water gun to a gun fight
Disgusting human being. How this behavior is taught is beyond me.
Suckers with guns are the biggest cowards around
Yes I’m my times there would be a fist fight, over it
Liberals can't even take a joke
joggers jogging
People loosing their lives for nothing. Two families devastated because an idiot.
I’m concerned about the lack of diversity in the murderers in this country
Heh, animals.
Can’t believe the school didn’t have any no firearms signs so that this would be impossible
Murica
Current and former members, look like a gang to me.
This was gang related. Nothing to do with the water gun fight. Video title is click bait.
Judge should give this guy life we don’t need people like him around all the rest of the normal people. If it is broken at this age I doubt it’s ever going to change. Avoid a repeat offender. Prison or death sentence
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth rule ,easy solution.
Lol
Poorly worded click bait no one fought over water guns they fought around extra curricular activities that just happened alongside a water gun fight and a basketball game... clearly fued related
Lmaao
only in ATL. lol
Culture, not about color. It's about culture. - Denzel Washington
Hey, that kid tht got shot couldn't breath too, but why not so much attention?
When his friend said lets go wet these guys up, he didn’t mean literally 🙄
Don't bring a gun to a gun fight
We support this
Ego, ego is what led to violence
Where is BLM wtf?????????
need more guns!
Just Sssstupid! Jail that Fool forever!
I think it is like some students were playing with water gun, while some outside group came in and the fight started.
How long will his homies and gfs, whom he tried to impressed, will visit his pathetic ass in jail?
This is America
How come students have a gun!?
Imagine living in the USA
This is sad=(
This doesn't look like it had anything to do with the waterguns or the kids having any type of fun. Those thugs that rolled in later on were up to no good, possibly looking to settle a score with one of the kids there.
Nice looking kid, now he's going to be somebody s  b.. ch.
This makes me sick man
Let’s play guess the race
ay  nigga  you sprayed my shiet, on my momma on me
Gotta set and example lock up the whole group that came from the court!!!
This is why Guns are sooo wrong for civilians. A lot of civilians do not have a grip on the meaning of responsibilities, a lot of them not even have a grip of their own life... and that we can clearly see here out of many other examples, where people draw and shot their guns for a verbal argument, because they can not control their emotions.
Bro introduce gun control. Lol
He got sentenced to life in prison. Im glad the judge wasn't easy on him and gave him what he deserves.
Caption 🤣🤣🤣
Blk ppl
Shieeeeeet
Bunch of wannabe  thugs and gangsters, should arrest the whole lot of them!
Looks like another hip hop video 🤦🏿‍♂️
Death penalty immediately for these kinds of cases would make people think twice about it
Straight cowards these days. We fought with our hands in school. Our time would have never thought about killing each other! I graduated in 2001. Wake up people and teach your kids about life.
Need to bring back public hangings like in the old days
What happened to the guy who handed him the gun? He also deserves to get locked up.
Dude must be fun at parties.
M sure that's USA 🤣
Sadhguru
Bruh!!
This is why we don’t have any types of guns in our house.
People nowadays are snowflakes in disguise 🥸 so fragile, so weak
This is why I don’t wanna visit America. Too many crazies wiv guns and the power to take lives. Take a leaf out of Europe or Australias book
Nights can't even have fun. Yall be killing each other for no reason
Where's BLM?? WHO ARE THEY GOING TO BLM?
Imagine living in a country where this is possible...
Life is screwed up
You have to be the most scummy thing walking the Earth to kill a kid while he's playing with a freaking water gun. Sick sorry HAN.
Wow so pathetic that guys would shoot someone over water what losers! Hope they rot In jail
“Yo you wet my shoes dawg”  **pulls out real gun**
Unreal
POS people that can’t have good fun.  Jealous people that can’t stand people having fun.
Bro, what the hell? Smh Keep that one for life.
No blm protests?
,,,,,BLM?
Never bring a water gun to a gun fight.
Only in America, I swear to god.
Wtf!? This world is so so broken. That pook kid and his family 😢
These type of criminals are very hurt and insecure people. They need a hug, not a gun. They're so mentally fragile that they'd rather gun someone down than to feel embarrassed and disrespected. They can't live with it. And it definitely starts at home. Kids build confidence and security from their parents
Literally why?
This was a gang issue. You can see the basketball players shakeup right before the fight that. That usually happens before they stretch someone.
Just don't make no sense hope he get life or the death penalty!!
Stupid. Why bother others having a good time
Sounds like the water gun fight is irrelevant in this story. The other kids came over from a basketball game. Stupid title.
This just proves my point that basketball is just turning into such a Thug infested wanna be gangsters that are playing basketball. 😂🙄🤔 Listening to rap music it’s played in every arena it’s promoted all the time. Basketball players really think they’re gangster and this just shows it.  Great example yall set I luv it!!!
teach your kids, or I will.
They came there just to start trouble with the kids having fun. Lock them all up and charge them as adults.
All involved should be charged
smfh...you cant be serious.
Blood and water was not the only thing these idiots had in common.
Why can't they release the full footage if the investigation is still ongoing? What kinda sense does that make?
The gunman should be drawn and quartered. I’m sure he is a real “gangsta” a real tough guy……. That culture is the single most destructive thing I’ve ever seen on a group of people.
BLM
Get your kids outta these neighbourhoods by any means possible.
How to solve this problem. Stop selling guns
Happy not to life in America :-)
American Moment
Dude was in feelings because he wasn’t apart of the water fight 😂
Imagine Being so pathetic that u walk up to some high schoolers that are shooting guns oh sorry I mean water guns ?   Ig I couldn't tell the difference but then again I'm not as dumb as the shooter.        Yes ik it didn't happen (I think).  It's 3 am and this is my last comment for right now till I find something different maybe a few videos on the Chernobyl Accident
Imagine your name being Dequan
Normal people: talk it out or just fist fight it out  These people: *Get a water hose? Naaa, get a fire hose or a pressure washer? Pfft that's funny 😂😂. Throw some hands? What are we kindergarten girls 🤣😂🤣? No I'll just pull out my Glock and take someone's life because I'm too cool for school.*
0:15 to 0:18 the best part of this video.
BLM and liberals real quiet now since there's no whites involved
Doug is a handsome gentleman
This is just crazy like those kids were just having fun
Can’t ever have any good times cause of idiots like him or fucking bad-doers ruin everything
I’m sorry for family and life stolen by a coward bully. Seems you can’t even be sure if your children will survive at schools now days. Everyone should be taught at a young age about the pursuit of happiness. Then go through a life safety class and issued a side arm Only thing I can come up with to make sure your child returns home.🍻
Thats why gun should be legal for everyone,, you can put in bag when school, work and all activity 🙄.  When someone going mad you know exactly🙄😏
Everyone has guns
Now this is the hood and if you don’t believe that then something wrong with you lmao 😂
god damn joggers
Damn georgia high schoolers.
Quite kid join the water gun fight
RIP
no surprise. ever city has the same problems!
BLM
That's what happen when you distribute guns like toys legally and sell arms to countries to wage ware legally
Stupid fucking rap culture is to blame
Liberal should take away guns from civilians
POLICE BRUTALITY!!!!!!! Oh wait... wrong video
I would rock up in a fire truck
Too much talking just show the video its blurry as hell anyway. But yea the shooter is an idiot.
The 1963 hart cellar act was a mistake
Is there a reason why they all look like that? You know what i mean.
All those girls out there and yall kill bill
lemme guess non Caucasian people?
If this how you react to water you can't handle what life has to offer
Just absolute senseless behaviour. Young adults with the future ahead of them to having it end after having fun with mates.
And they say India is a dangerous place 🙄
One inmate says to this guy...why are you doing LIFE....gun fight?? Reply..no water gun fight...
They need to charge at lest 2 to the crime one provided a weapon to that boy. That used it on that high schooler. What a punk it’s ok, Ive worked in a prison hell be someone’s bitch soon
Even a $30 camera on Amazon has better quality than this, and maybe you would find the suspect
Animals
This is why guns should be banned. The only reason people need guns is because other people have guns.
When the quiet kid brings a real gun to a water gun fight. R.I.P whoever died 💔
Trying make the community safer??? How honestly how
we wuzz kang! so don't play with squirt gun.. he said
America
There is always one person guy with a small penis waving a gun about talking about being a big man 🙄
I've lost all hope in society at the age of 17. That's just sad bro
THIS IS AMERICA
*He's a trash bum,I hope he gets life in prison* No parole
*This news lady is Beautiful*
All for a little bit of bum clout. Cringeworthy.
well he better either be dead or be in jail for the rest of his life, a life for a life, but rip to the young man just having fun
I just wanna know how in the absolute fcuk a squirt gun fight can turn into a real gun fight?
Ah yes, another day in usa
Trust me is not pleasant neither having a group of( "kids" )playing in a parking lot with water gun that is not the place trust me they knew the other group will pass through there but they was trying to anoying them little by little moving their direction too once getting in your way, trying to b smart running  around the cars not belong to them also not just the other group but if anyone hit them with a car by accident  there goes you life turn to a complete mess is other people need to go through and they don't  respect . Thing like this you take it from a child if they make you wet or hit your car but none was little kids neither. Both sides was wrong .
Sad. Yet not surprising
People that use weapons in a fight just proves the point of how weak they are
can't have fun huh, some salty lowlife gangster wannabe gotta pull a gun on some childish water gun/balloon battle.
Update he was found guilty about a week ago
Trying to have some fun and here they go had to start some sh...smh
“ Yooo you have a Water gun, Well I have a real gun  Im the Boss here “ Sad soo sad  60 years minimum in prision you should only come out in your last Days soo you can retret your action
Extremely sad for the one who lost his life. How crazy is this, when are people going to learn there are consequences for making extremely poor choices. First off he's 20 years old and does not have a right to be in legal possession of a handgun. Then this idiot make another poor decision and fires at someone after his weapon falls to the ground & discharged striking someone in the foot.   Now for his poor choices he's going to be behind bars for quite some time.  If he gets out his life is pretty much f**ked up afterwards, good luck trying to land a good.   It's so sad that kids can't even play without someone looking for trouble and showing how stupid they are.
Ganglife
Everyone thinks they’re stronger when they have a group of friends or a weapon with them.
Typical 🤡
Any person hanging around high school after graduating or dropping out is going to become a problem 💯% of the time
Its fucking water...
Kids need Father’s to teach and to correct them and to lead them. That is what is missing in todays society. No men of God to lead their families.
Some sad s**t
Safer for who?
America guns are the problem police need to have a tank to defend themselves first ban them from everyone with criminal record implement European style regulations and permits ,ban anything that isn't a handgun and start taking guns away burn the 2nd amendment and destroy all copies collect guns door to door very detailed search,ban civilians guns in public, only qualified people like hunters and police can have anything bigger than a handgun , handguns only allowed for people that meet European style regulations, handguns only allowed for home defense gun violence problem solved and police will no longer be afraid of getting shot at so reaching for a gun wont be the first thing they do but the last
I really wish, if only the guy could see few insights of his future before he shot. People just really don't know how a simple actions can F up their whole lives.
Atlanta is ugly as place to live imo
I hope this guy did not get a chance of parole and got life in prison for shooting that kid, I've had enough with gang mentality violence. It sickens me that people have to walk strapped up because of inconsiderate human beings with huge egos that don't value someone else's life, like I'm sorry you don't value yours enough to not get into this type of trouble but it's no one's fault if he had a shitty starting life he could have changed that himself we all have choices and he made his. Glad he's locked up and I hope he fucking rots in their.
It all starts at home
So a bunch of kids planned to have a fun day and these idiots came and disrupted their plans by coming to start trouble. Hope they give him the death penalty.
Imagine being such a worthless POS that you shoot someone over a water gun fight. Smh.
Wow, like howdid it get to thos. They couldnt just be like not today we having fun today.
BLM?  right.
Fun to Gun
Glorifying gang activity as a credit for gaining respect and using music and culture to communicate this will soon show it's instability. Unsustainable.
Bruh
Damn that news chick is a babe tho
seesh
the most op loadout in a water fight in my neighborhood is a hose, water balloons, and a pump up squirt gun. but now guns?
crash dummy
Wow mofos now just can't take the L. Lol
smh. Hooligans
Only in America.
Is it democrats? Or demographics?
Time to ban all water guns
BLM 👎
NO RIOTS FROM BLM ABOUT THIS MURDER???
Hey it’s ok! It’s gun rights! Yey for killings!
Idiots having idiots.
Lmao this is soo stupid.
Anyone know where we can see the entire video???
Wtf is wrong with america
these kids aint go no parents
Is this a BLM event?
this is why I stopped playing basketball
Welcome to Clayton county aka Jurassic park
Man, some people need to control their egos. "Man my feee fees were hurttt and now you're gonna get blasted!"
But blm the right?
So many whimps now of days using guns in a none deadly altercation, afraid of getting wet or using his hands like a real man if he's got beef e.e
Tbh leave those water guns for tiny kids especially in this day and age with weapons come on use your brain prevent and always be careful not hard
We need death sentence in all states. I bet ignorant mfs won't be acting tough no more
Thats why America is fucked up. You guys have guns like i have some icecream from a store next to my house…
They must got mad about them kids getting they cars wet 🤦🏽‍♂️
Imagine leaving school and still going back to hang around and intimidate people. Weirdo
Wow!!! Imagine that....goons acting like goons.
Only in america
Only in Atlanta
Stupid ass people shouldn't have have guns. Very sad that someone had to loose their life Now he's gotta spend 20 years in prison.
two words gun control
RIP
Wtf
Someone got in they feelings over a water gun 💀
This had nothing to do with the water fight this is older kids coming to be bullies.
Dark people in a nutshell. Censor me some more YouTube.
America America
Joggers be like
He must be fun at parties
Nerf Special edition ?
I hope that idiot gets life in prison
Fuxxing haters .
This reminds me of bugz from d12 got gunned down on bel ai  Bridge in detroit and someone sprayed his cousin with water and they guy pulled a gun out and killed him
Always basketball players.
That's hotlanta! At least they have Kenny Rogers roasters there otherwise I'd say bomb it
Damn people will do the most to get out of cleaning up after a water balloon fight
America 😂😂😂
nothing to see here you know. just an African American society.
Personally if I was there I would have been like, your so tough you brought a gun to a water fight? Kinda sad, grow a beard before you hold a gun
This shi** is just stupid! These idiots & cowards can’t even fight anymore without guns, and let their prides escalate into death and jail time.The GTA generation 🤷🏾‍♂️
I assumed the prisoners were getting a special event and it went bad
Wtf is wrong with some ppl
This is why you can’t have nice things
ban guns already
Just remember someone who bad at sword then begin to kill everyone with water gun.
bro fr upgraded
He was prolly scared or the water and didn't like to take baths. 😂 He a coward.
A bunch of low lifes...
The suspect just graduated high school too. Like what was the point in even graduating if u we’re gonna throw ur life away like that
They took wet his back to a whole other level
LMAO! No way!
When someone got the wrong gun out and shot, and was thinking to himself,  now I can understand how the cops get confused
What was even said that causes this man to shoot? Did he like lose a fistfight?
Update: He got a life sentence in prison on 12.19.2021
Only in USA. Tell me why gun is still allowed in a country where most of the people have mental problems?
Just sad something so harmless turns deadly . Like what would make a dude get all aggressive with people have water gun fight .
Someone didn’t get them memo, water gun fight, not gun fight. It’s really sad that kids can’t have a little fun and end up surrounded by violence.
So group of drop outs and thugs causing trouble because they are drop outs and thugs. Fkn losers !!! God bless that boy that died.
Orcs gonna orc.
Blm cant even have fun
Hope that idiot..never.gets out
Not enough water....fun.time...tragedy
I wouldn't say 18 year olds about to go into college are kids.
"We can't even have a damn water gun fight"!                              - Not...lebron James
He looked like a common sh*tty gang member. Idk why they always look like that.
Damm what a fragile ego. Real men know when  to walk away. Why he stupid in the moment and lose all your freedoms because you’re angry.
Fragile ego
Not surprised. I see what kind is involved here….
they love jail is where they find Allah!!
So why u doing life becasue they was having fun shooting each other with water gun and i was too cool and they shot me and wet my jays up so i killed him
This video actually made me so sad!
everyone is acting surprised. this is how the world is now. you cant even WALK outside anymore.
Oh the culture....🤣🤣🤣
What a scum bag! Kids out there having a water fight and he gotta show how tuff he by pulling out a real gun! I hope they give him a trillion years! R.I.P. to the young man that loss his life 💔💔
America, check. Guns, check. So-called visible minority males in a group, check. Fathers absent-not in their life, multiple, unknown, checkmate.
Cold world
somone really boiled the water
Where blm outrage?
What’s wrong with blacks man
https://youtu.be/cOhVDYaHVX8
Dead cause someone had To pull a gun like a little B!+(h over something petty.
"Students and former students" ok so dropouts and future dropouts, sad how some one worthless takes away some innocent persons life
R.I.P to the senior who was there to have fun not to be killed over some miserable wanna be young adults taking  someone's life
You can't  even  have a good time without  someone being stupid messing it up
People of USA are so crazy. It’s literally a GTA country.
So sad two lives thrown away over ego his homies aint sending commissary trust me
Normal day in USA
This guy deserves 110 years not the poor truck driver from Colorado
It's funny They have no heart. For their own.
Why don't yall get along
Bruh and whoever is protecting him are some goofies. You don’t walk up to some people having fun and take someone’s life just because you felt like it. Mfs today don’t know what it mean to be gangsta.
Where was the guns to defend ?
good job finding the squirt guns involved
Why is everyone so negative?
Guns don't kill people . People kill people
I'm waiting for the united states leaders to make this into anti gun violence, and gun control lol as if knives arent just as dangerous if not more.
Just put the dude under the jail, and whoever wants to follow suit right next to them, people wanna complain about guns but yet I guarantee the gun used was stolen and nothing was in the shooters name, idiots like this don’t deserve to see sunshine
Sad that the culture promotes this lifestyle for African American people in low income areas.
Thought it was water gun officers I swear just thought mine was just fancy
🤦🏻‍♂️ NRA controls USA
Damn can’t do nothing nowadays without knowing there’s a chance you may be involved in a shooting
Wouldn’t surprise me if kids had neighborhood gun fights tbh in a few years
Tf- 😐
What a weirdo
Judge:  Why did you fire the gun?   " he diserespected me therefore naturally i must have to take my gun out, shoot him and kill him. "
All lives matter
Another lefty out of control.
should change the title to video of nothing
it’s always fucking atlanta bro 😭😭😭
Sad how people can’t even have a water gun fight and get killed with real bullets
I’m guessing the group of basketball players had their cars parked there and didn’t like the idea of other people damaging their cars with water…….. sad.
damn
Americans.
Bruh
These kids need to hang out in different locations...
America should do something with those weapons......
When you think your a man and carry a gun but you went to go play with water guns.   It’s funny how we are just adult babies having temper tantrums but put people in real danger as adults.
In pied he rest😹
The shooter was a basketball player? Damn. They gon play with his balls in Prison
In chicago they took down all hoops
There might’ve been a water gun fight going on…. But he didn’t shoot that kid over some water bruh…
That's sad , can't have fun with a gangsta wanna be around. They too hard to have fun
Thugs should learn guns are not meant to be used to win a fight. If you need a gun just to fight someone, you're not a man.
What a sorry sack of crap
“Basketball Americans” literally cannot goof without someone dying
To The Person Reading This You Are Awesome & Hope You Have A Great Day!!! :) My Dream Is Too Hit 10K I Hope You Can Help Me Accomplish My Dream! And Merry Xmas!!!
Some people don't like water / cleanliness!  IDIOTS!
you should drop peoples like this addy so people are able to send them mail..
WHERE IS BLM?
imagine toting a gun n not throwin hands 😹😹
Shaun Allen’s mom probably: “He was always such a good boy that ain’t ever done nothin wrong to nobody in his life. He’s so sweet he wouldn’t even hurt a fly.”
What a dam shame! these kids should be having fun not commiting murder. Broken hearts and futures destroyed, Somebody tell me why,
Nigga said “wet me w that water gun & ima wet you w a real one”
Snickers
Keep that gangsta culture going and this will continue
So these losers show up and say my territory and the other dude was chill and the other guy shot him……. right
Which lives matter? I think people forgot.
only in ATL
Why people can’t just let others have fun
Only in Atlanta
yikes man. Glad I didn't grow up in a bad area.
I bet they made him a bitch too
USA is just live-action version of South Park
And they say BLM....
Wtf is wrong with people
Threw his life away for pride
Classic Larping mixup… The hoopers and the larpers….. Usually the larp squad handles business in a duel, but the hoopers must have gotten sick of watching the larp squad having more fun and they joined the battle without understanding that the weapons are fake.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Electric chair for pay
If you would put me a in a single room with this guy I promise you he wouldn’t be the same when I’m done...
Man screw this county, I’ve seen a video of a cop shooting a fellow cop from poor gun safety.. now this...
Common trait with the African Americans I see.
Bunch of idiots in this video. First, the suspect is beyond stupid. Beginning with dropping his OWN gun, causing it to fire into someone’s foot, then proceeds to ask some other IDIOT for THEIR gun so he can kill someone w it. I mean y’all. Is there any faith left in humanity?
#RealRap https://youtu.be/37SPU679-L4
“Yo bro, I’m in Jail for life over a water fight” oh cool bro… cool 🤣
Y’all acting like he died cuz the water gun fight he died because they got into an arguement with a group of dudes who felt like they had sum to prove
So pathetic. How do people like this even exist, and where did their parents go wrong?
Full video  https://youtu.be/AnL6AaiHr7M
Legit any other country and the most we would see is either s guy knocked out
Make me strong not an obituary 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Dummy. Hot headed at the wrong time.
Turning into a scary world. You have to worry when you go to school, the mall, movie theaters, and now apparently when you have water gun fights with friends. Truly sickening. RIP young man.
I feel like my training in fighting is pointless at this point. So I bought a glock
I’m only here for the ignorant comments 😆🍿
American gun culture at its finest
BLM my s
didn’t even tell what all really happened that day 😒 SMH
Dang … Rest Easy 💔
Bruh I can’t stand the human race. Not in a million years will we ever do better as whole. Humans are disgusting. I don’t want to be here anymore.

Cant even have fun these days
Man y'all kids playing with guns way too early in y'all lives, y'all need to be worried about school, making a career, not selling crack. When I was a kid we played video games and played outside. We didn't shoot each other. I can't stand you new generation of Demons.
Stop the violence oml..
Estados Unidos el país más seguro del mundo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🎪🎪🤡🤡🤡🤡
What ever happened to a good fist fight.
always that one person that feels the need to pull out a gun bruh
Everybody gangster till someone starts boiling the water
Dirty ass  allergic to water🤣🤣
America 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ok hang on there's a big field in the background why are they having a water gun fight in the parking lot?   And come on you got a group of people in broad daylight. Why do you need to pull a gun? Are your hands that soft and you don't know how to throw a punch?   Fist fights you may end with a bloody nose, but guns will end lives.
Blocks can't have water fights without it turning into a shootout
This is America
Imagine trying to have fun with your friends only to have your life taken. Devastating. Just devastating.
Better not let him out ever!!
People be so stupid ,  Sayin fu*k the cops ,  but Doesn't stop committing crimes  Surely more cops would come up
They kill they should die the same way….
Doesn't take much these days
People must not actually be listening to what happened. The water gun fight didnt escalate. It was a seperate group of people that entered the scene.
I find it so wierd when someone that is an adult and already graduated is hanging out with kinds in high school even more when they are trying to act tough or cool . Bro focus on your money and your future wtf are you doing with your life .
If he really wanted a fight he would've used his 👊
Crazy, jus some kids tryna have some fun with water guns and then some people have to ruin it, let the kids have fun.
Why i knew it was Atlanta
And people say mexico is not safe
Why with real gun? U can't accept being defeated in front of ur friend?  Then just fight fairly bro Ur life is useless now in jail...
Well I mean maybe it was an accident maybe he had a water gun that looked like the real gun and he grabbed the wrong one
Only in America
that's how i won
Next time use boiling water on the squirt guns
MERCA!
Thank god My country has strict gun laws. My condolences to the boy's family. R.I.P
Lol blacks 🤮
We are the knights who say Ni
And he’ll get released on bond for $20,000 because our system is racist
God bless all of you may they Rest in Peace ❤️ Psalm 23 “You’ll make it. Trust me.” Philippians 1:29 “Your pain has a Purpose” God never allows pain without a Purpose, God gives his toughest battles to his Strongest Soldiers God bless all of you ❤️💕
“This is what we call a nigga moment”
BLM
Just add more Gun free zone signs they work
It's always that one kid
did he upgrade his watergun from lvl:1 to max lvl
"CULTURE " NI**ga
This generation dumb
I think the school needs to update its cameras
BRUH. Kids are playing pellet guns right in front of my house, it's annoying but they're having their fun time. Smh, this dude is certainly a coward for pulling a gun against a defenseless citizen, go fight with your hands if you're truly a "gangster".
When he touch down in d.o.c hes gonna be with a bunch of angry men so he can use all that ego on
Leadership in the community? How? These fatherless youths will get the guidance and support they need? Probably not.
If you take someone's life intentionally, you should have your life taken away whether it's death or incarceration
Fortnite: Battle Royal
Hm sounds like fun
Thug life dawg!! What a gangsta! The hood is proud.
Of course its atlanta
Imagine throwing your life away for nothing and taking someone elses with you absolutely pathetic.
This makes me sick/  Can't even have fun without the haters being involved.  This is very very sad!
Wow people were just trying to mess around with water guns and someone has to escalate things and actually shoot someone
ive always wanted to know what goes on inside peoples head before they pull that trigger to take a life over what.. an argument i guess
People can't have fun anymore
That's just sad, Cats just wanted to have fun
BLM hit again
Water guns/real gun
🤡🤡🤡🤡yall think that gun play sweet until u get the charge and ppl on ur head str8 🤡🤡
When you pose as Jim crow while shooting your gun. You might just be melanin filled
This is why we can't have nice things
This is why mental health is essential he didn’t know how to de-escalate his inner anger took it too far all for the sake of being seen as “tough” just sad.
Don’t be squirting me cuzzzz
WOAH JAMAL CHILL DONT USE ACID
This is so sad teenagers actually took time out to enjoy their last bit of childhood having fun playing with (Water guns) and water balloons as kids should and then someone has to bring a real gun and end a teenager's life even when kids try to hold on to being kids as we ask them to they're forced to deal with adult situations all because some AssHoles
Show us what happened right before he got shot. The kid probably shot him with the watergun for no reason.. a big nono to people you dont know. I guess you can say daquan f'd around and found out 🤷‍♂️
Can’t even have fun without someone taking it too far smh 🤦🏾‍♀️
If Party Poop was a person
Its not the color of your skin its they way you are raised.
Only the victim was involved in water gun fight. The suspect came over from the basketball court specifically to fight the victim. This was not 2 guys shooting water at each other then pulled out real guns.
Punk.
They should’ve been playing with their water guns in the suburbs instead
I feel like it's the way these kids are growing up and the influence they have around them mix with not fully understanding consequences leads to all parties suffering. Our society is to blame.
0:21 sorry what ? tf this guy just say ? 🤣  on a serious note tho , rest in peace to the boy. he was just a kid. 🙏🏽
Death penalty
LOL!
"We have scheduled a meeting with county leadership to make the park safer" that is a joke
We'll the moms always say my son was good boy he just liked to play basketball
Lmfao. But BLM right or no?
BLM
blax peepo
Like I said it could be anywhere and if the person is having a bad day it’s not all fun and games for that person.
hmmm.. im not sure if it escalated because of the water fight. seems like it was actually another reason but then again i don't believe anything i can't see anyway
Don't think these people would like Thailand's national holiday.
This is next level braindamage imagine getting so mad over a WATER GUN that you decide to kill people over a prank
What's the excuse this time for the dude that killed him I can't wait to hear it I bet that ppl think he shouldn't get in trouble and it's sickening
Im sure there were some good protests to make sure it doesnt happen again
People are dumb
If you take someone's life you should be executed. Prison doesn't help, it just teaches you how to be a better criminal.
Atlanta really the worse place in the US
USA is truly a special country!
People are such snowflakes ❄️ sad to live in a world like this :(
https://youtube.com/shorts/sC8iaoduG8Q?feature=share
You have to be a Dumb Idiot to kill someone having fun who wasn't armed. This generation can't fight, all they want to do is shoot. Now he will get locked up for Life
They was just trynna have fun . Sad world we live in . Rest In Peace to the person that got killed ❤️🕊
Can only imagine what the world is going to be like 10-20 years
Why do high school kids have guns? Oh wait I bet their family members are in gangs.
Gang members should not have any freedom.
BLM😂😂😂
Smh….weak punk teenagers
What a weak WEAK excuse of a man..
i think there should be a new law that you first have to undergo basic fighting, self defense techniques and an anger management course before owning a handgun. Because its sad when people shoot since they can't fight. now you have to worry about who you square up with nowadays
Murder shots are always jump shots lol why can people only shoot people on their tippy toes 😂.   Every legit self defense clip the shooter is firm and calculated with a defense stance.  Shoot with your feet planted people, it helps in court haha
What I don't understand is people who are adults and finish with high school going back to start trouble. RIP young man <3
Ego battles weirdos.
Why say “allegedly”????????
America and their gun laws are f’ed up. What’s wrong with y’all
These mfs really dumb out here Thts y I barely interact wit people
Those cats would run from a shootout but kill a unarmed guy crash dummy crash n burn
To be fair though the water gun wielder doesn't have to reload, so the murderer was kinda at a disadvantage.
Lol "shooting SUSPECT" will always be hilarious, the camera literally shows that inbred pointing the fucking gun before it fired.
👂👀👀😯😮😯🎥📹📲💻🚔🚓🚔
Damn water guns getting powerful. Be careful y’all
Should have sticked to playing basketball, now he’s gonna be playing cell warrior in prison.
Lmao, this dude left the courts to go harass a younger group of people.
Never bring a water gun to a fire fight.
Unbelievable
I hope that useless piece of garbage gets what he has coming to him, and charge the other person with the second gun with accessory to murder as well.
Another reason why you should take guns off civilians, a lot of deaths could've been avoided
can’t even have a water gun fight without it turning into a gun fight. Dw soon enough all these wannabe gangsters will all kill each other like the idiots they are 😂
I remember being a senior throwing water balloons at other students. Those are some of the best memories I have and I couldn’t imagine it turning deadly. My prayers goes to all witnesses and family members of this young man.
Just why: The cops didnt have any effort to eliminate every gangs that are there, saw one, just capture them or neutralize them by any means if they attack
Oops, wrong gun
Y’all trippin ! That’s a whole clique that walked up on em.
Lock everybody with him up and throw away the key
put that dog to sleep.
“Whatch our kids water guns can kill people”
Can't do nothing fun in Atlanta when stuff going on like this
R.I.P to those loved ones:(
Ngl I live in Europe and even the "gansters" that are from the hood you can joke with them and you feel save around them. Tf going on with america and insensitivity with humain life.
poor kid
Yo
So pointless.
NAAAH THEY REALLY PACK-A-PUNCHED THEM
We all grew up watching aouth park how r we offended this is so stupid
I’m sick of saying/commenting RIP 🪦 All this Gun violence is too much
if anyone know him in the comment section. he a 😿. tell him square up. anybody can pull a trigger and then RUN. cowards die a 1000x deaths
U can't play with everybody ...in you just can't shoot people because u embarrassed 2 lesson learned so sad
]OH MY GOD TYATS NARUTO UZUMAKI FROMK FORTNITE!!!!!!!!!!!! EVEN SUSSYKEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Moral of the story  is don’t bring a water gun to a gun fight 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
20 year old?? Tf he doing with around high schoolers
Dam can even have a water gun fight with out senseless violence
Fun fact : Gun Cant Kill, but People kill with gun
No one can have fun outside anymore 🌎💥
BLM
damn bruh smh the bay best not turn out like this too
Changing to your personal gun is alwats faster than reloading.
I wish he sits in jail for the rest of his life .
Imagine bringing a gun to a water gun fight
BLM
This is america my good people
Lol.. Give em more bullets, let the problem handle itself😁
what a coward!!   he will get his ass kicked in prison
This is what happens when yall cut off funding gangs take over and start killing people and now most dont care if ur a kid or a woman they'll still shoot ya this is why you wont see me living in a city
Wth
street dudes so lame dawg like u buggin over a water gun, like that shows mad immaturity and lack of common sense and self control
V
Guns n USA.
War. War never changes.
I see this video recommended to me. I read it twice then im like..  "How?"
The person of colour moment, where simple words hurt ones ego so much the melanin in the skin starts to seep into the brain and violence boils over.
He was actually trying to play! Just pulled the wrong gun 🔫 smh...
Let em kill eachother 🤷‍♂️
Why are guns so easily available to everyone.. whats is wrong with you Merica?
only in america
imagine bullying someone over having a water balloon fight then killing him. this guy deserves the death penalty save the tax payers money. don't want to pamper and wipe this guys ass in jail
So many of these videos seem to have one thing in common.  I just can't figure it out
You never really do know when you time is coming, dude lost his life for playing with water stay safe yall
Allegedly???
Nice
I couldn’t even get past her, I kept rewinding and watching her 🤣
Embarrassing
It don't make sense how you wanna hang around a basketball court but not play basketball and still be a thing with no sense and tote weapons and smoke weed. Defeats the purpose of the court and endangers innocent hoopers and kids.
they akways saying they working hard to make somewhere safer. aint no way you gon ever do that if people are walking around with guns!!!! aint nothing you can do once the shots are already fired, damn idiots
The man who did that deserves to suffer in unimaginable ways
Man this is just sad and infuriating bro
whats wrong with america
How low you gotta go to kill someone over a water gun fight?
When I was this age I was trading pokemon cards...
Men who use guns to take down someone are not men, real men throw hands and show their tenacity in hand to hand combat.....a gun is the easy way out and the cowards way.
COWARD ! Because without one you ain’t nothing
Law enforcement is dumb and blind.
This is basically what my anxiety shows me. I feel like I can get killed for even looking at someone nowadays and it's sickening  Edit: for everyone telling me to get a gun I’m not old enough.
Poor kid, he was just trying to have fun with his friends..   Only funny thing about this story is that, without that gun, the killer would get his butt whooped just about everytime in a fight. Scared,  insecure little guy he is.
In a country that anyone is allowed to have a gun, this should be just normal.
it’s the fact that I go to kenwood elementary school it’s scary
This the type pf people who need 110 years in prison, not a guy whos breaks failed causing an undortunate accident
BLM✊🏻
How are the 20 year olds on the basketball ball team if there not in high school???? And R.I.P to the senior fly high 💯
bro pulled the strap out coz cuh cant fight,L man
You know, I wouldn't be pissed that I was killed, I'd be pissed I was killed in the last year of school
Give him fucken life
oh man is joe bivn
Heard hes a green light🤣😈
It appears the water wasn't sufficient to put out the fire!
🤔🤔🤔🤔
ayo wtf, My birthday is May 7th..  0_0
wow the United States looks fun
Huhhh
okay but why is noone talking about how bad the news caster is
https://youtu.be/SpOdI4hBL4w
With water gun
Only allow kittens in the park.  Problem solved....thanks GRIM.
This why you can't even joke with people, people too sensitive
Smh he was a senior and just having fun! May Allah keep his family strong InshAllah
🕊This is very sad. I wish I grew up in a different time era when men used there fist to fight, handshake,and live to fight another day, and to have that respect. Nowadays you gotta be cautious with everything you do because you never know what the outcome can be. Guns destroyed this generation. Only if times were different. I pray for there family💙🕊🕊
I am so sick and tired of misleading titles. The squirtgun fight had nothing to do with this outcome. This was two groups of individuals with a history, exchanging words. This was about the same prideful, chest beating, gang mentality that leads to many of these situations.
World war never ended, fake news?
Cowards
Imagine thinking being in a gang is the move
Mfs can’t even have a water fight
irl cod rage
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
only in america
Ignorant people shouldn’t have guns
only in america boys
RIP Bugz...
So he dropped his gun felt like a dumbass for it when it went off so he grabbed another one and had to regain his man hood. Crazy
What a dummy can't run with no money and family support while running so he ain't voluntarily turn himself in he gave up cause he was hungry broke and homeless.
Why was ther no blood
Very cool how a bunch of students are just walking around on high school grounds with firearms
Always one trying to show how bad they are in front of a crowd
Prayer to the family
They were just playin around bro
If u wanna fight fight like a man dont use weapon.
all anger ends up in murder and all anger leads only to hell
Who losses A watergun fight then takes his revenge with a firearm
Only in Atlanta
Too many young dumbasses with guns.
This is the most american thing ive ever heard of
This title is gold
these people really be the dumbest of all time, acting like you're just gunna go home over shooting a guy in front of 20+ people.
I be in clayton, they hood
He threw his life away just to take another's 😕 May the victim rest in peace 🕊️
I think I’ve seen a heard it all now
wow
just a future nba player
that was just old beef being settled horribly, water balloons and guns just gave them a chance to settle it
highkey if u kill someone rob someones life in a way like this u dont deserve the luxary of jail u should die too
Killing somebody over water how embarrassing
quick...ban water guns!
ego made him murder.
Females with guns all i see
I guess every GTA Games that:     Always Never Bring A Water Gun On A Gun Fight
BLM
only the police has the power, they should be around parks making sure everyone is ok
What TEMPTATION say Run Run Run but you sure cant hide😄
oh wow
What a ruin of beauty day for them. Stay safe all of you.
00:15 gawd dayum😳
Your ppl will never  break its own chains.
american Moment
My advice,  move to the country, , work from home… shop at Amazon, Walmart, Sam’s club online, the only time you need to go out if for booze and  smokes. That’s what I did …. Oh But PS I still have a neighbor that threatened to shoot my dog if god forbids, it goes on his property to play, play, that’s right, it’s his dog! I improved the fence! and yelled at the dog not him. Called him Sir, not scared, I got guns too, but I was secretly filling the A…hole saying it No use aggravating him!
biggest troll in history
“Of course we had one student dead”
"What led up to the violence". The "up" is totally unnecessary.
How is everyone getting their hands on these guns?
Don’t spray water in the A.T.L.
Lock that violent gang up with Shawn Allen in a state mental hospital  clean up America for good
So a water gun fight, turned into a real gun fight! Really! Wow, just wow!
still wondering why former students are wondering around a school they don't even attend anymore
These people are just plain stupid. The internet is full of examples.
"Wait this isn't a water gun?"
GUILTY
If you start a real gun fight and shoot n kill someone over a water gun game.. You are indeed a loser.. And shouldn't ever be part of society..
everyone was having fun at first like wtf happened playing ball and having water gun fights
😆 🤣 😂
Wheres Turkey?
this is what the leaders of the communities never address. to them, living their high life away from actual communities, always sweep under the rug what they preach to the communities and then when someone outside speaks about it, they immediately start ranting.
Vote in stop and frisk.  Guns on school grounds, parks, and anywhere children gather should be a 50 year sentince, just for possesion.  That will give the state 50 years to determine if this person can return to the community.
"squirt guns..." XDDD
car wash gun is op btw
Brain surgeons still hanging at a high school they don't even go to anymore 😂😂
That is just sad.. what is happening to us all.
Ok, dont bring a watergun to a gun fight.
fatherless activities
Haha I love this!! Blacklivesmatter??
why did they walk their a$$ from the court, i guess they were afraid water would get on their car
atlanta?   lmao
So sad.  Kids having good old fun and some low life takes offense over being squirted with water.  What kind of household raises an animal like that, who thinks killing a young person is some how a demonstration of manliness? A police car with a couple cops just standing by would have deterred this tragedy from happening.  But...thanks to the social justice fighters, who live in the nice houses and whose children do not have these problems, that would be considered 'harassment', hence no police around.
Sin is a big problem in this world
What the hell
I'm sure he had a legal carry permit for the handgun. Right?
Mick Dundee: you call that a gun.....
These people are why we can't have nice things bruh
The locus can’t even have fun without killing
its like that one boxing match where the guy cheated with some iron stuff inside his gloves
sad for the aspiring rapper, he threw his life away
Damn that lowered Nissan altima though 1:02
Now that's what I call impulse control.
I love Georgia
"....on going efforts to make the park safer for everyone." Here`s an idea: how about doing away with the ridiculous gun mentality.to start with.
agian u know all about making comunity safer just look at this 1 park that theres alwas shooting theft robery at u said ur working make safer that was over 5 years ago but still dident o what its this part and o what its still going on after years of u saying it lmfao pigs are all talk no show
bruh
It seems like folks can't just have fun because one crazy mf always wants to kill the other.
these fragile egos man
the kid that got killed is gonna be heated when he sees his kill cam
Went from 🔫 to🩸
Where is BLM on this?
nigga thought someone was about to take him out
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
WHERES BLM?
🤪🤪🤪
Jail bait.
He should get the electric chair. Others in the group that confronted the kids playing should be charged as accomplices as well.
Typical….. js. 😔
US: gunfire because toxicity UK: waterfight turns into a roast battle on our mum's
They can't even play right, BLM
"People cant even have fun .....When its a guy with the Gun"
BASKETBALL PLAYERS ? THATS TROUBLE.....
Yo Homies! I Couldn't Afford A Water Pistol But I Do Have My 9M On My Waist. I'll Use That Instead
They were all Caucasian
I know a way to fix this crap bring back the death penalty and fry these scum bags with a few 1,000 volts..
That America for ya
How does water gun fight turn into GUN FIGHT😂
What do you expect? lol
This the type of stuff happen when goofys can't take a joke smh
Got his ass kicked so he hid behind a barrel of steel
Damn, how am I 16 and when I had water gun fights, and when the fight gets serious, some grabs a water hose or a high powered water gun. Now, they just shooting because of a water gun fight because they think they're badass? Damn, ain't no way times changed that quickly. I even remember when folks were nice, easy to make friends with and people would be walking to the store and chilling outside enjoying weather.
Call and report every single murderer in the community every time they do it. Harming so called snitches is keeping the funeral homes with a constant supply of fresh bodies. While we're protecting murderers we're burying our babies. Not sure about you but I'd rather see a murderer locked up than see my child buried.
Imagine being this big of p#ssy.
Fayyte
I live in father county
“High school seiner” so sad. Didn’t even get to live his life yet.
Those guys playing basketball did NOT want their game interrupted... That much is clear.
Malheureusement aux usa les armes ne sont pas des jouets .tant que les armes sont en ventes libres il y aura des victimes .stop aux armes
Only in America & it's only going to get worse they have too find a way to get the guns of the streets & out of kids hands
Dang....so much for .....naaa....never mind.
I know how to improve the safety of the park.
We need to ban high-powered water balloons and automatic water guns!
Sounds like a set up. Also sounds like a bunch punks scared to fight.
RIP
can't even swing pool noodles in my neighborhood or else people start breaking out broadswords... i know how it is.
BLM?......yea sure,when police kill someone only huh?....sad asf
they were just having some fun :(
Looks just like the type... His momma gonna say "He was a good boy and didnt do nothing wrong!!"
THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH UPBRINGING OF TEENS AMONG CERTAIN RACES!!!
Moron i hope he stays in prison for the realist of his life, who brings guns to a water gun fight???
It's always one idiot who Spoils it for everyone 🤬
They got mad over some water like they don't take shower
This is sad af
This wasn’t over no water gun fight, they obviously had previous beef.
That escalated quickly 😳
You media poeple are fuckin fufu, the water gun fight didn't escalate, it was cut-short by some beef the participants had with a whole other group !
Them dudes on the right eye a whole gang of hoes...it's girls out there getting wet and you bring a real gun to a water fight? Time to have nothing but men for the rest of your life!
SAD, JUST SAD.  SAD THAT WE CANT C, SAD THAT EVERY MONTH WE LOOSING 2 MILLION  PPL IN THE FUTURE.  PROBABLY MORE....💯💯💯👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿🛑🛑🛑
The guy turned himself in?!  Dude's a dumbass. He's 20 years old, shot a kid dead, and it was caught on tape. Ain't no way he's getting out of a life in prison charge.  He didn't have morals when he decided to kill a kid, don't pretend to have morals now and turn yourself in.
Now live the rest of your patetic life in prison "gangsta" hah...
Is the new music  everyone  turn up
Coward. Having fun then some wannabes come and Bust up the fun and instead of fighting
We sure miss this pretty face on NEW4STLS but she had to do what she had to do because STL is a very racist place and you can see it on the news channels in the broadcast.
Where is Tarzan when you need him?
I hope everybody can see the elephant in the room. I would point it out, but I don’t wanna have a label put on me 🤷‍♂️ but you know what I’m talking about. It’s just a case of reoccurring events with the same people…..
Fine young joggers
time out the officer said they exchanged fire.  1:53
Urban mentality is the decay of society.
no to racism
Now When there is a fight there is 50% shooting 50% stabbing .human life has no value anymore
Representing your people accurately , keep up the good work!!
I guess people don't like other people that have fun
Melanin
“ I hear people talk about it, but still seeing Bodies with tha motherfuckin chalk round it” -biggie
Kids these days play ROUGH!
this has got to be the dumbest reason to die and to commit murder. Imagine going to heaven they asked why you got killed "water gun fight became a real"
Men who want to look good for other men and die doing it… you deserve it lol
Damn he really "wet" that dude up lol
Nah he tweakin
Hmmmmmmm let's review, water gun fight hot Atlanta GA day check, B Ball game nearby gets confrontational check, Baller's draw pistol's w/o permit's to carry concealed check, pi$$ off bad boy shoots into crowd to prove man hood check, sounds like a normal day in GA!!
they stop the basketball game just to go cause trouble,WOW such a loving caring race
JUST ANOTHER BLM SUPPORTER DOING HIS THING
nothing to see here, no pattern observable
speaking of which....saw a super soaker 50 in target on clearance for $12 the other day
What kind of loser hangs out at a high school when he's not a student?
Why wasn’t this on CNN?
I was just trying to find the video of those guys inviting random people to a water gun fight world is wild
Life
a whole generation of emotional feminine sensitive dudes.....lol.
Man, America is more dangerous than Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq Yemen, Somalia etc.
Stupidity. This is what decay looks like.
This is frigging crazy! 😠 😠 😠 😭 😭 😭 😭
Remove the basketball hoops and the park will be much safer.
Damn 😔
Get rid of the basket ball court
Biden Voters at their finest!!!!😂🤣😅😅🤣😅😅
Yeah
Gun laws, who needs them.
I thought BLM?  No?
Your kids in this generation doesn't know anything about the Bible no hell . And sure enough you know nothing about life . It's just not in your county it's all across the nation most to use of going to hell and don't even know the consequences once you're there . Read your Bible and study up on who you are. And just because you didn't get caught doesn't mean you won't pay for your crime . And I mean forever and ever you will be tortured Non-Stop . There will be no rest . It's best for you to learn about the Bible even though your parents didn't teach you
How sad and pathetic to kill another human being for a water gun fight…Glad they caught him before more innocent lives got hurt in the future
someone had to bring real fight.
@1:40 "now these kids knew each other" how can he say that? he has no facts to back that statement, typical thick know nothing cop
imagine ruining a water gun fight 😭
Dis GOSTO be da DUMMEST generation ever created...
people really willing to die or kill over respect fucking pathetic
The title alone made me give up on humanity 😪
somebody drowned
Someone let the BD's in
Where's BLM and the liberal media?
It's so sad how iPhone 12 have better video camera quality than security cameras do.😔
A bunch of illiterates. Be smarter. Calm your ego and walk away from confrontation. The tougher , and bigger man is not the snowflake that reaches for a gun, or uses his fist. What a world full of snowflakes we live in!
Every single time, PRIDE is the reason this happens. Every time.  Pride is a weakness
This is wrongly misrepresented this was not a water gun fight that turned deadly these kids were having a water gun fight and some other kids came from the basketball court and a whole new situation broke out this is misleading the unfortunate death that happened here had nothing to do with the water gun fight take this post down
That’s why I keep tha strap 💪🏻
Imagine being such a low life that you get mad about someone spraying you with water that you have to shoot someone.
Odds are he’s bragging in the county about his “body” .. R.I.P. this young soul, such a senseless act
And when he resists arrest it’ll be the police departments fault for the force
Idk it’s probably the police departments fault. BlUe mAn bAD
Wow seriously people needs to calm down wth
Did BLM reach out. I think not. No enrichment for their agenda in this case.
It’s always that ONE person to mess it up for everyone else 🙄
Dumbass with the real gun didn't get the memo!!!
Sad, very sad.
guns don't kill Its the people who kill guns were never created to kill it was produced to help people grow food for their family stop blaming the gun.
People just needa stop playing like this
I'm always curious to hear what the gunman's family and friends have to say in his defense ! he was defending himself, he didn't know that they had a water gun , thought that was a real gun, ...smh something stupid i'm sure
Dudes can’t even get hit with a water gun without getting all hard now days. Life’s to short for all that
sounds gang related imo or at least rivals to some degree. either way a very sad story and my prayers and thoughts go out to all involved
Typical
Damn!!!Can't even have fun anymore...Dumbasses
The whole world is f'd up !!!!
What a shame. But we don’t need cops
What a lil bit$$… looking back at who he thinks are his homies when he’s swinging his arms talking ish he can’t back up with his own hands. Trying to be bad when he’s a mommas boy and he’s not bad at all. No friends now and he’s looking at a lengthy term of being somebody’s plaything on the block locked up. Shoulda stayed in your own lane lil bro. Nobody to save you from your own ignorance now… and you don’t look hard, but you prob shoulda listened. I’m sure somebody along the way tried to show you right. Too late now.
Unnecessary
I’m assuming this goes deeper than just “escalating from a water balloon fight” there probably is a past. If not the kid deserves to be hooked up to a truck and dragged around that parking lot
Blm
God forbid they try a water balloon fight... Then out comes live grenades and motar rounds...
BLm what a joke and tooth face
All of them that we're on that basketball court that came over with guns should be charged with accessory to murder
Always
All this police brutality and racism destroying our country
The shooter is innocent tho.he just mad that they didn't get the invite for the water gun fight 🙄
People are just asking for the government to take our guns
Hey guys lets go play basketball, dont forget to bring your guns. The hell is wrong with people. This is why racism exists. Stop it.
Wondering if he’s going to be walking all though in jail like in the video
I thought this was a joke, parody or clickbait. WTF?
I thought it was a cop who had shot. I would not be surprised.
Dropped the gun. We got games for that in the USMC...
So damn sad kids teens cant even have fun now a days, I'm so sick of these wanna be thugs or hardcore trying to be whatever its ridiculous and needs to stop.
I knew who shot the gun before they even showed the rest
I remember I was young in like 11th grade at Westlake and some buddies and I went to Waffle House after our football game and shot some friends cars with paint ball guns (washable). It was all fun and games until the school thug from New Orleans decided to point a pistol at us. Always somebody that has to be an idiot.
rip bro ! Hey Parents acting surprised at world you have created is making me laugh so hard !  IT GREAT isn't IT !!! But my Generation does not know anything right. RELAX NOTHING IS UNDER CONTROL... MY GENARATION AS PLANS FOR EVERY ONE MOUAHHHHH PEACE above all !!
See they can't even have fun with squirt guns without shooting eachother 😂 then wonder why they the police arrest them more often.
Obama needs to control his sons
Allegedly ?? Wow
BLM
Sad
Yeah im sure that meeting well help! Greatly! 👌🏻
My 80s Summers North Seattle were Magical we had Supersoakers it was the Best I Miss the 80s🙏
This wasnt a “water gun fight that escalated.” Has nothing to do with water guns. They were minding their own business and having fun and some other kids clearly trying to start a fight just came over then because of that a kid got killed
Dud threw his life away like that 🤌
BLM should protest this, burn the school, demand the head of the school, protest racism in America and seek other attention too, because it might have been some cops fault..
Kid’s a bum. Same with his friends. Wanna be gangsters
Bullets should be 100$ a piece tax bullets can’t solve human behavior bullets are cheap to cheap!!!!!!!!!
Wow talk about a misleading title. The ppl not involved with the water fight shot someone that was not two ppl going from water guns to pistols
🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏻
And still to this day they continue too say that "BLM" !! 🤔🤔
Cowards . Throw the book at him
Lol 🤣😂 thier goes hes whole life!!! Keep letting that rap music take your mind this is the end result. Now the only sounds he is gonna here is metal closing and skin slapping!!!
Hot heads huh think back in 1800s America when everyone had holsters and guns out but no one was quick to shoot each other. Now it's this
I grew up in the Clayton County area over 25 years ago – Man has it changed.
I would have grabbed my back pack 10 gallon super soaker when I saw the revolver and hit him good
Classic
PURGE !!!!!   2022 !!!
Very sad
PRIDE.
Could only happen with Basketball Americans
Wannabe gangsters always pulling guns and killing each other... Misguided youth... Living a fake lifestyle...
A bunch of drop outs that shouldn't have been able to use the school property made at kids that are happy to be winning in life..
Atlanta the next Chicago
Bring back,  Stop and frisk you demon rats 🐀.!!!
Wow people can't have fun  these days.  And just have to duck bullets if you can.. just sad..
All intentional murders should be given life with no chance of parole hopefully that'll scare them enough
“We’re being hunted in the streets”!!! -Lebron James
Jealous wannabe high school kids, should have stayed in school.
this generation too caught up in trying to be gang from all this rap music influence nothing but to do with killing one another take a good look at the world we live in today
Monsters made in monster 👹 factories
Good that the idiot turned himself in…now he can be a good girl in prison and be a good wife to someone who will love him every day
So wait, did he think that he wouldn’t get caught or he just simply didn’t care… I’m all for his sentencing.
Blame the new trash ass rap music
Just sad. What happened to fist to fist ?
You want me to make parks and schools safer with 2 quick things??  1. Remove Marxist Mayor Bottoms and support your police. 2. Remove basketball courts from all parks and schools.                     YOUR WELCOME!!!!
Poor choice of decisions now he's going to be a prison bitch over a coward act.
Domestic terrorist
Wow i guess that he was raised right.
Awww he squirted me with a water gun..... :( I'm gonna cry now like a bitch!
Only in america
I'll soak YA ...NERF STYLE
This takes the prize ..what the f,in fawwwk
I pity my generation.
The dude who's gun it was needs to be changed as well he gave  it to him to do it
Being an emotional reactor will get you no where in life except prison
so pathetic
Sad humans
I HOPE HE JOYS PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
Mlm
My guess is the thugs came off the court to confront the people throwing water balloons and water guns hitting their cars. Just sad...
Should round up his group of friends and cast them out into the ocean on a raft. We don't need them.
He turned himself in.  He will get life  at 20 years old. Good
When you grow up with no father figure in the home.  No respect for authority or for life.
When low levels found a good area to battle then the high ranks pass by
god damn idiot will spend his entire youth in prison.......there he'll quickly learn how tough hes not......30 years
Ahh men...
Diversity is our strength
Guy was salty that he was getting his butt handed to him on the court
TYPICAL
I know this isn't a laughing matter but when they showed the crime scene with the water guns I couldn't hold it in lol.
BLM
Que want cops this going when you going cops when you going when you open this policia when you going out cops when you going when you going down when you going out this going suspect when you going out this Friday 15, 2017 you going when you open this policia when you going out call 9-1-1 you phone when you going ma'am when you going when you open this policia when you going out suspect when you going when you

Why does the lady look like she was filmed in 2005?
Give his aZz a 1000 years.  He earned all of it.
Dang. Can't even play with waterguns anymore. 😢
It always has to escalate and then a gun always has to be pulled out and somebody has to die. Kids can't even have fun spraying each other with water in the park.
Wow that news lady is smoking hot!!
Terrible!! Bunch of guys playing with water guns like we all use to do. How Sad!! Of course taking away peaceful people who have guns to protect themselves from thugs that killed a young teen because he had a water gun?? And you Demwits want us to turn our guns in?!! I don’t think so. You Dems get rid of your body guards. Costing the tax payers too much money. Not on your life since they think they’re better than we average people who pay for these ppl to have bodyguards and guns. To protect them and we can try to protect ourselves by hiding behind a tree? I think not. 💁🏼‍♀️
It’s their inflated egos/trigger tempers
How fckg stupid can someone be.
Losers couldn't let them high schoolers be. Came uninvited to a freaking water fight to start a real fight...
What does taking a life prove to anyone? Everyone else is going to continue living life and forget all about you sitting in prison the youth have been destroyed in their thinking God help us
70 people shot in Chicago , 13 dead over the weekend , and it’s still Sunday. My deepest condolences to you , I love all of you , poor children .
Wow. That news lady tho...🤯
Wow, what a cornball.
This is how stupid people are becoming. There is a part of the brain called the frontal cortex. It is supposed to  protect you from being a fool.. Can’t we just let them kill each other till they all are gone? At this point that’s all we can do…
This is NOT AMERICA....This is INSANITY....
This fool will have enough time in jail to reflect..
How internet control kids
look how they roll up on them, like there tuff
Bro wtf... that's fucking degrading, water gun fights are suppose to hectic and chaotic in a good and fun way.
I see 13 problems with this video and 52 ways to solve them.
The Uk laughs at these headlines, literally only in America 😂😂😂 but u have no gun problem 😂😂😂😂
less dialogue more gun control huh
imagine taking someones life because they shot you with a water gun, hopefully he got life in jail for this, he's a disgrace to the world
So was this a good guy with a gun or bad guy with a gun? Once again, GJ America
Good 5hing he turned himself in. That could've led to another "no knock warrant murder" ....
message to youth, you are not tuff because you have a gun. you guys are cowards now a days.
Children with real guns and anger and self-esteem issues.  What could possibly go wrong?
That’s just sad bro we can’t even have a fucking water gun fight or water balloon fight
Only way to deal with this is to keep people like him in jail
Water Guns , real Gun!! Now someone in prison gonna put a broomstick between his bunz
Omg so sad😢
Just stupid to lose your life over a water gun fight, my guy your 20 years old , let those children have their fun smhhh 👁️✊🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿pray for my people.
as long as it's blm'ers killing blm'ers.
Ban water guns.
rest in peace in prison
Jokers these days might as well be Ladies cause they cant control emotions naww they less than.
He should be in jail forever
Take him to jail
Ugh 😑 tired of this nonsense, God take the wheel
These people wonder why they can't have nice things like a harmless water fight
LOCK Allan's ass up for the next 75 years.
People are crazy as hell my Lord
These people just love violence, anything from robberies, drive by shootings, mob lootings.  You can't go to the park or walking on the street without looking over your shoulder.  You can't even have a  nice and peaceful water gun fight without them bringing a real gun.  Our country is going down to the toilet, people.  This is so so sad to see.
I don't understand this....... Soo sad.
It is NOT that serious!! Kids just can't be kids nowhere!! Rest in heaven young man!!
Thank your local Democrat. During the elections democrats sent a message and it was this burn down buildings, assault people and kill each other we dont care. That message was heard load and clear by criminals.
Your ego will kill you.
MAN! Dee's kids getting water on MY CAR!!!  ........you know when it rains that happens too..?   NAAAHHHH! DEY disrespecting ME!     🙄😑
Hey Lebron
What a p*ssy
Plot twist: the guy was an alien 👽
That 1on1 fight is just impossible anymore... 😤... mfs can't handle them hands so they go to easier solutions which is "I can't fight so I'm a prove that by blasting"  method.. weak asses in 2021
How does water fun turn into bullets . Did someone get their hair wet and feelings hurt 🤦‍♂️
They came with an agenda. No reason for this foolishness
This is what happens when you let the Government raise your child.
I'd like to solve the puzzle, Pat.
Sounds about reggin
This is america
Wow. They're gangbanger looking droopy draws. Who would have known. Bet they listen to that "murder you" rap music all day instead of a working a job.
When you bring a power wash to a water gun fight
Who still lives around these things ?
wow bruh
I have a suggestion
plot twist glitch water gun turns into water gun
News reporters in U.S nowadays before presenting the news live: how many gun violence report today and how many deaths?  5 shootouts and 8 deaths Reporter: geez tats too low shall we wait for more? 😆😆
How could something FUN end up so sad ???😮😮😮
I guess BLM don't matter to them... Well he's gonna b someones bitch, fresh fish.
Take him out back
This crap don't make no sense they went over there and start picking on them and they in a higher grade this is not right
Just from a pure statistical point of view this is why stop and frisk worked so well in NYC.
Maybe humiliation?? I know it's seems like just a water gun fight turn gunfire but there's usually aggressive acts with water balloons and it can be humiliating specially if there is enemies
Someone should have drove an SUV through that crowd of people
The faces of WOKE!
What led up to it is marijuana cigarettes drugs and alcohol . Atheism has huge part in this violence too saying everything is ok filthy beings
What really led up to it ?
They mad they weren't invited
Of course
No self control, no fear of prison time, no regard for human life=not a working brain cell.
So very very sad
no self control in these kids. i blame the government and their parents.
I swear these people are from another planet.
man shooting is so lame like you really cant be a man
Enough. We humans are beyond repair and redemption. Let’s burn it all down and call it a day.
There not having fun...news are a liars...defunct the news station
BLM having a peaceful outing how nice
That's Georgia for you...not many residents ever manage to make it far from their local high schools...
God said those who ashamed of him I will cause you too be ashamed of each.other
Jogging and water guns don't mix !
I almost committed suicide when I found out I had herpes virus, I was going through a health blog when I saw how a woman testified of how Dr IGUDIA on YouTube cured her and I decided to contact him, to my greatest shock he actually cured me and now I test negative. You all can also contact him for help on any kind of disease on his YouTube channel
wtf.. is this.. water guns to fire arms.. ppl are so fucking stupid I swear, gun shots are so common you see it everday on the news its not even funny
Good toys... But they prefer anal toys
I believe rappers who rap about murder and others bad things is killing this generation.👎
Oh what was the race of the shooter
Not surprised, some of these kids can’t hold their egos.
ONLY IN AMERICA! Gosh it's nice to be Canadian, cause you know, I can go out with out without worrying about getting shot. Thinking about it, I'd literally have to find a cop and try to attack him to have any chance of being shot. And even then it would take a lot of force for them to shoot me.
BLM
Punk. People like this should not be able to walk the street ever again
Some people just don’t like it when soap and water hit their body...
Gotta love communities who glorify being "hood" and "gangster". Gaurentee no normal minded person would pull a gun for a water fight. Normal people walk away, or get water balloons
He needs life behind bars and off the streets indefinitely
too coward enough to throw them hands up anymore.....always grabbing a gun..smdh
How fukn cute, high school gangs. Did someone get their soccer cleats swapped for an underclassmen.  Did Polly-jean get mad and tell her tyronious boyfran!
absolutely LOVE how these idiots destroy each other. I agree that the police should leave them all alone and just go away.
After seeing this is that proving we are the falling stereotype by default and its sad. I just cant🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
wait how lol bruh people cant have nothing
When US said they use real gun for protection. And this is some of its examples.
Why do people assume that because there from the same high school they know each other? there has to be at least 500 students at that high school, To anyone reading this do you know every person that goes to your high school?
I'd like to solve the puzzle Pat.
He shouldn't even have a trial
So dumb for people having guns and didn't even know what to use it for 🙄
I mean me and the lads never went for a kickabout after school unless half of us were carrying fucking guns like.
Petty af
I got friday night funking ad on this video
Looks like he shot him while his back was turned to the shooter...
a parking lot is for parking cars not a play ground, evein when i was a kid we didn't  do stuff like that because not only did we not have the money to pay for damage nothing in that parking lot was ours, and most parents won't pay for the damage caused so here's the truth shooing the kids evein those we know how some high school kids act it would of bin better to call the cops no reason to ruin your life. because i have no idea why your playing in the parking lot when there's a big grasses field right at the top of the screen, not saying the shooting was right but it could of bin avoided if parents would talk to there kids about the dangers of playing in a public places with strangers YOU DON'T KNOW OR CAN TRUST, don't assume be smart
I don’t understand why guns have bot been banned in America. I’m happy I don’t live there. It’s too dangerous
Oh well.
Good job America, legalise guns!
Still got some outlaws in this world
You honestly thought they weren’t gonna get arrested
i used to think my grandpa was crazy when he said it’s the music , but it’s really one of the biggest influences
My friend loss her son  and he need life in prison
The Water Fight was only mentioned for clicks and views.  This had nothing to do with any water fight.  The press is a shell of it's former self.  It's so sad to see how far Journalism has descended.  These folks are just youtubers now..  over-dressed and talking funny.  They have no insight.. no connection.. no relevance.
00:15 They need to fire her..  she's too beautiful.. we lose connection with the story as soon as she's on screen.
*"No justice, no peace"*  Edit: _Sht I'm on the wrong video._
This boy is gonna wake up  20 years from now and be like "wtf was I thinking". Unfortunately it's gonna be in prison!
same cast of players different stage...
Whoever see this comment I’m encouraging you to get right with God before it’s too late and repent of your sins. Have a bless and wonderful day. Amen 🙏🏽❤️
BLM in real world.
Naming your kid Dequan will make him a bullet magnet.
Well there ya go. More for the statistics.
Atlanta is a toilet, I can’t wait to move out of Georgia
Blame the parents
this is why you don't invite the quiet kid to the airsoft battle.
How they forget to use the water
We’re all thinking it, but not politically correct to say it outloud…
Woow
What a punk
Can we please start sitting children down to let them know! Killing someone is NOT like in the movies! This is ridiculous!
Wanting to look tough probably costed him his life
Give him the LWOP, he doesn't need to walk amongst us anymore!
Of course guns….. mfs can’t fight
Welp, looks like I ain’t making friends no more
no cap
Doug looks like epstine if he didn’t touch kids, and instead became a news reporter
It’s all about the culture
Can’t do anything but shake my head
When our water guns fights escalated we used to grab buckets these idiots grab real guns!!
Ah, okay it's just local boys expressing their cultural norms that are accepted by society. Nothing more, nothing less.
Raise taxes on democrats and throw the money at the problem.
Smfh
Basketball players come out of no where and shoot people cause of a water gun fight cause they think it's childish
And once again the SAME cultural group is involved in gun violence, and yet our government blames guns for the actions of this select group of subhuman actors who need to be locked up forever.
Sad …fuk ninjas out here being fuk ninjas
WOW he's 1 of those.someone never showed him how to take a L 😕.
Erase d
Some Cain person said police action is incorrect,  but people like that one. In which ways you act i give the reason to a cop because the people . wat cain drug they're use but act like crazy animal.take out that Cain person of the earth.
Ignorance running wild
Alll of the ppl that were with the guy that shot should be charged as well! I’m sure they knew what he was gonna do! Idgaf if they didn’t pull the trigger they’re were accessories to the murder.
Always 1 stupid one spoil everything lock 🔐 him up forever 🔐
That shooter must have hate others soooo bad to kill them just for playing with water guns god dam it humanity sometimes don’t makes sense
The officer said gun shots exchanged. There was no exchange just a murder.
The only way to stop these crimes is to punish the criminals to the fullest extent of the law.  This will teach them and be a deterrent for other.  Just like you teach you children at home.  There are rules and there are punishments when those rules are broken.    I also think the prison system needs to be reformed.  Stop sending money to foreign countries and let's use that money to build jails for young offenders where they can receive the best rehabilitation possible.  Have them include drug rehabs, schools and trade/College courses for the young teens and young adults.   Don't throw these people away.   Use our tax dollars at home for them after they get in trouble but also before.
Big dummy.
When you are unable to control yourself this is the life you will end up with.
Basketball americans strike again
America,s finest will put the criminal behind bars, not the one,s you see on telly,  and show other, criminals  you will not get away with this sort of nonsense..  Nobody should have a gun anywhere near children full stop,,,, pass a law, pass a law, you know it makes sense.
He was looking for trouble i hope they give it to him
Well, Obama, did say "don't bring a water gun to a gunfight...."
America just so you know this kind of thing shouldn't be happening in a 1st world country.
You got this bro you a bad guy was it worth the rest of your life in prison make sure to cry in front of the judge he will let you off free you are bad bro
Imagine trying to be so cool that you have to kill a student. SMh
Only in the states you get shot for some water
I will not allow my son to play a water gun anymore.
You people don't know anything about the streets it wasn't about the water fight it was about gang beef one group caught another group from the high-school as the news lady said they all go to (most likely were they pick on each other and fight )off guard ( lacking) and they pressed the issue. The guy with no shirt was really about that life. Taking someone else's in broad day with many witnesses very Bold and also stupid but Bold.
Rip🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘
😐🍿
The main question is… Where did these kid get the gun from? Who gave it to them? We need to get to the bottom of this. 🤔
This is what you wanted merica. Errybody wit guns right
They got his shoes wet
Well I mean look at their race…. Is anybody really surprised ? But everybody says cops are the dangerous ones 😂 idiots
So let me get this right Shawn drops his gun, the bullet goes off and hits someone’s leg. So Shawn gets angry, grabs someone else’s gun and murderers another??  This guy belongs nowhere else but in prison that is the stupidest mentality anyone can have.
Until 2nd amendment is gone. I am labelling the US, Mexico, Central and South America as 3rd world countries.  Because they never truly learned statistic of how gun bans would dramatically reduces crime rate, and unnecessary death rate. Yet, they want OPEN CARRY. If you realized, every other country which banned guns, has almost 0 mass shooting (eg: school, mall, etc), and almost 3~5 shooting incidence per year only. What about America? Mass shooting, every, fucking, day. Good, get yourselves out of gene pool for supporting 2nd amendment.
I paused this video right after the anchor lady says what led up to the violence,,,,,,,,man she;s gorgeous!!!
Smart guy.
no words for this.... just... *sigh*
Ofc its in Georgia
that might make them think twice before they kill anyone else
hang em
All that twirling around and posturing , you can certainly tell when some fool is about act up. That's why I kept to myself ,there is always a bunch of insecure assholes that gotta ruin everything.
Or ask yourself what all this s*** has in common what's the one factor what's the one thing that you see all these murders have what color are they?
This kind of stuff didn't happen in this area 15 years ago. I grew up in Forest Park, watched its decline & the same things happened to Jonesboro/Lovejoy. Guess its time to move even further away from ATL.
Grade A student absolutely!
these killers real proud of themselves, feel sorry for the students who were there to enjoy a harmless event.
This Sheriff says he has a lot of dialogue. You also have footage of this Punk with a firearm shooting and killing some guy playing water gun with friends. Capital punishment starts right here any Bozo with the mindset to pick up a firearm to use it this way should be on death row.
No race mentioned...interesting.
Pour some Nicotine into the water.   Once the water touches your skin, you're sick or dead.  People should not screw around with water pistols.
That's why I stay my ass in the house
Been offended by someone having fun, what a world. There's a butt-hole i grew up hated people having fun, he would always try to start fights, the freak  still does to this day. He's Billy no mates.
Such a great community of people!
The culture will never recover, it’s so lost and there’s nothing that can be done , wtf
The moment when he knew he fucked up.
Man that gun control is working just great lol
Imagine being such a pssy
Why are you in jail? Uhm, I had a mean water gun fight Somebody's jail b---h
Are you serious? What is the mind of the people of Atlanta made of? I'm upset. Pow! Take a life...Demons and Demonesses. Weak
One word- GUN….
Another colorful story…
BLM haha what a scam
Give him life. no mercy here.
Sheriff said there was gunfire exchanged?
That's b lax for you
Stupid
Is people shocked about this? You say raise your child right, but I say raise your damn child. Hollywood is raising these braindead kids nowadays, not the parents who are too busy working and paying bills. You have to be in all areas, not just some and then leave the rest to Mainstream. Raise your Child.
SO UNCALLED FOR!!!
I’m sure you can blame this on systemic racism right??? To all the leftists.
Disrespect me my ass!
Clowns need beheaded publicly asap
They can't even get along together
Turned himself in? Oh his mom for sure heard about what happened and threatened to beat his ass unless he turned himself in.
If these highschool students would have been cops... ... they would walk free from the mass shooting.  Why? They would explain it as "a direct threat from a group that painted their deadly rifles to look like innocent nerf-guns"
It ain’t that deep
Bring back th death penalty
Atl so lame bruh
Typical Atlanta
That's why I never leave my gun at home. You just never know
HOW
The man an idiot plain and simple
Must have been a racist cop behind the whole thing.
But they keep trying to convince us that the police is our biggest threat!!
Just make guns illegal :/
Never bring a water gun to a real gun fight
I never should have voted for Biden. This is all my fault.
When there's no 2 parent household
This is history repeating itself...I'm 39 and when I was a child the super soaker was new and the latest craze and a teen was shot dead because he used his super soaker on someone... I never thought it would happen again but it did..
Its a culture thing
Wheres blm at?
The moral to the story..... Atlanta.... enough said....
Where's BLM at on this one???
0:52 imagine seeing this without context
Que des tarés
I know how to stop the shootings. Dont sell guns to the public.
I thought their lives mattered to them lol
Never bring water gun to gun fights😁 Jokes aside the shooter deserves 40 years to life. That way he gets out of prison an old ass man
Looks like a low life druggie
BLM LIVES MATTER...........
These kids these days have no hands.... in my opinion its easier to pick a gun up a shoot. Yall ALL soft.
This has no end until people raise their kids correctly.
Kenwood park.  Isn't that a no-gun zone?  Maybe you could start by getting democrats to pay attention to some of the laws?
Dude found the weapon upgrade chest....
Where blm at ?. They sure don't act like any life matters not even their own.
Who is the anchor woman though?! 👀
the park would be at least 50% safer if you banned. say, 13% of people from going there...
Just bunch of idiots!
Smh. Urban people
What an idiot 🥲 finna be eating noddles errdayy 🤣
oh wow the cop didn't shoot the kid with the water gun this time....    mind blown. I was wondering how fox would cover a kid with a water gun being shot by a cop, but I'm guessing that'll never happen.
This is just another example of toad stupidity...
"Hey bring watergun." "Oh, you mean gun, alright then."  Smh.
DAMM SHAME!
Trash
Poor guy
Learn how to deescalate people. Walk away and don't let pride get you killed.
Couldn't fight i bet, used a gun instead.
Sad 😞
Imagine you havin fun and you just die
This is what Juneteenth celebrates.... Thank a democrap
this can only happen in atlanata
blm
BLM where you at???
This type of water gun fight only happens in certain neighborhoods
They did not want to get wet in a water gun fight, so they brought out the heat.
Joggers
No worry there will be No riots
If you really want to make the park safer, GET RID of the basketball courts!
Dont care what anyone says, it really should be ALOT harder to get guns, especially as a teen...
Sheeeit.
Only in the US!!
The RACE BATE HATE AGENDA.........is working well  Emotionally and Psychologically WEAPONIZING .........all communities that make up this great country........to hate and rip each other apart!!!  And its working like a gem
I don't normally endorse the death penalty but anyone who's willing to KILL over something so petty should be put down.
Why the actual f#ck is it that SEVERAL of these _highschoolers_ just happen to have handguns on the ready after playing basketball?
It’s just water..
Can't even have fun right...lol
Biases: Confirmed
he killed someone, now court then found guilty , then judge says death  in the morning, old day justice, -----next case,
but why
where's blm when u need them...LOL!
A beautiful culture.
The problem is these people have no culture.
Didn't anyone remind these kids that "blacks lives matter n' sheeit"
so the water gun fight had nothing to do with the real shooting.  What if they were sewing or doing needlepoint?  would the headline read, "Sewing Circle Turns Deadly"?   Why does this section of the population live like they are a bunch of ants in a jar? You never know when someone might shake the jar a little bit, and everyone starts killing each other.
Ain't no guns in prison I feel bad for the homie that shot em
Niggas scared of water?🤦🏿‍♂️
1. What idiot gets mad for being squirted with water on a hot day? 2. Why call him an alleged shooter when he literally is on film shooting a gun?
He probably didn't get the memo that it was water guns, not real gun 🤷‍♂️ honest mistake
If the students only had more guns so they could defend themselves. I'm sure this kind of stuff would stop happening 😅.
Where do these people keep their brains? This "drive by " with water gun is unimaginable being a good idea
America is a very backwards place
Need more guns.
Lack of father figures. And BLM had the nerve to list on their website their desire to eliminate the nuclear family structure (which every study shows is the most crucial element when it comes to keeping kids out of prison and poverty). BLM is a mind control organization intended to divide & destroy. Anyone with a brain should see this.
Welcome to the 2000 where if you have a water gun fight you get shot sad how this world gone down hill sad tbh 😭😭😭
juneteenth will fix it
Does anyone ever ask, where do these firearms come from?  How do these kids get these guns?
This generation to soft
This sounds like The onion story.
Hahaha
how much of a psycho do you have to be, to kill someone over a water gun.. like.. their parents failed them so hard
Blacks are something else man 🙃
Well they got rid of the stop and frisk program they got the bail reform they want to defund the police so there you go
If you're going to pull out a gun over words because of a water gun fight,  you should not be released back into society.
Disgusting . absolutely disgusting .  water guns are so dangerous.  Wonder if these basketball players ever read a book about anything.
Absolutely ridiculous.
have a basketball match then arrest everyone who turn up. That aught to do it
Wow end of school start of summer vacation and an innocent game of water fights WTF 🤬 kids can’t have any fun no more without some jackass ruining it.
But remember everyone, police are the problem. Not ghetto culture and lefty policies that destroy the family and coddle criminal behavior all while blaming a Boogeyman that doesn't exist. More CRT and zero bail!
😫🔫 I never thought I'd use that emoji again after they changed it. Yet, here I am.
Let the kids play. This was someone looking to shoot someone.
Once again my people cease to amaze me 🤦🏾‍♂️ we always finding a reason to kill one another. Hell, even when the kids are out having a good time, they can be killed.
What a shame.   So many angry people.  Cant even play anymore without a risk  of being shot
As someone who knows about the case first hand it was ruled self defense. The didn’t even show the whole video.
BLM Violence
There needs to be some type of death squad to eradicate these doughnuts
The virtues of diversity.
death penalty or how does the next one learn that this is not the way?
These kids are super soft....Smh
A gun is such a easy way to kill someone.  You just aim and fire.  What a waste.  He will just join his like in prison and join a gang there.
Straight BUSTER!
The quarantine wasn't all bad..ppl dont need to be outside no more.
This is why I don’t deal with BM. Call the cops every time. Idc idc idc
You killed a child because of your ego?!
What's Lebron James take on this? BLM!
Lock him up and throw away the key.  Bubba will take good care of him
His mom said he was a good kid 🤣
Hope they find him and give him LIFE in prison.
BLM but they killing themselves
Water guns will now also be ban. People be crazy.
There are certain people who have no fear of: Bullet wounds, Lengthy Prison Terms, Forced Rape (in prison), Loss of Freedom, and Eternity in the agonizing Fire of Hell.
Guoddaymnd. A fkn water gun fight? Really?! Well, I promise not to k'll anyone who shoots me with a water gun. I might pop ya in the chops if I'm omw to an engagement, but I'm not killing anyone for that mess. What's wrong with people. Blk people, how do you expect grassroots to get the message across that our lives matter when they can't even get YOU to believe it?  This is exactly why we're not one people and being brown isn't going to make that kumbayah moment happen.
They sound intelligent 👍
Aha wasn't there a story about some people doing water gun fights instead of actual gun fights. This shows you what a stupid story that was
must have got his Jordans wet.
At least he turned himself in.
Making the park safer isn’t fixing anything until they find out HOW kids are getting guns
*_Dont even know how the hell a high school student would have a gun on them. What are their parents thinking right now. 🤦_*
Imagine being so weak minded you kill someone because they made you look bad.
Stay indoors  water gun fight turn deadly stay indoors 🤔
Over nonsense.
Cameras are everywhere. And I do mean everywhere. Dummy!
they love using "allegedly" for facts
The south has more crime, because you can get a gun easily
Pure ignorance
I want to know BLM opinion about this
Bro what happened to boxing??
Imagine being a gun to a water part fight
Joggers
Shouldn't this be a gun-free zone?
😂 😂 😂 💀 🌚 Don't matter even to themselves.
This world is going to hell in a hand bag.
Water guns are gunna become illegal now watch 🙄
This is SAD "LORD SAVE OUR CHILDREN" 🙏🏾
So water gun fights have escalated into real gun fights now? Sounds about right. That is how some folks settle their beefs nowadays. True cowards instead of a good ol fashioned fist fight. Like Craig's Dad in "Friday" said "you win some, you lose some, but you live!"
Well...he Can Be Shirtless with BIGGER men in Prison. 🥳
Sean Allen the  " Murderer "  Sean Allen the soon to be " lifer " Sean Allen the the " Water fight killer " No matter how you look at another senseless murderer is off the streets and behind bars
BLM?
It's like a nerf gun fight but then someone pulls up with one with real bullets wtf...
nice kids
😂 damn, mane got caught "slipping"
I thought BLM was supposed to stop the violence.
What a weak human, can't even take a water gun lightly... Another reason why America needs no guns and more sense. It ain't the wild west anymore guys...
Come on down to the A folks…here we can show you how stupid we can be 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ban the supersoaker now!
Nah he was twenty, why yo behind around teenagers...😒😒
"cant we just all get along"
So they walked over there and killed him forrrrr what like what was y’all reason for killing this men are.  Intervening with what they had going on rip bro I hope he gets some dirty in jail
Senseless… No Words for this
Wet em up!
A aaa
blm
How the hell does a water gun fight escalate into shooting someone to death? This is terrible, who raises these people to do these things.
Shows up because they were jealous that they are having fun so they ruined it by looking for trouble. May you rot in hell.
when they're walking around with their shirt off and ass sagging, you know trouble is brewing!
Those friggin no gun signs didn’t work?   Btw BLM or maybe not over “exchanged words” life’s too precious
Taking school spirit way too far and I doubt any of these people are capable of graduating...unless the faculty passed them out of fear or/and good riddance.  I bet that on graduation day, teachers throw up their own hats, briefcases, pens, laptops, apples and coffee mugs (still filled with hot coffee!)
Man what a loser I hate those people so much
Diversity should not play with anything that resembles a weapon
Stupid wannabe  wangsta go rot in jail haha
BLM LOL
Notice a pattern here?????
Another Obama family reunion gone wrong.
Next comes the record deal. The industry knows how to keep the hood down.
here, u can see how lame people are in that country lol
This happens in every hood all over the country everyday during the summer
They ain't Trump voters.
Never ending story.
20 years old beefing with high school kids wtf
What is WRONG with these people? Who pulls a gun for water balloons?
I almost got stabbed because some kid got mad over a water gun fight.
seems like the nice cool water would have felt good on their darker skin tone.
There gonna ban water gun fights now Watch, cuz of you dummies, self extermination WHAT A CONCEPT , get on with it, & make it quick!! An what??
20 year old be like... yo you got my nikes wet, take this.
And this kids, is why single motherhood should not be praised. Ps: I don’t know if he is from a single mother home. But statistically, he will be.
You scheduled a meeting? With community leaders? You mean,former prison inmates,turned preachers.that will really turn those kids around.kids with guns,tend to not listen.thats why they Carry guns.
The knights templarss and fbi are dressing in garb shooting at blacks
Good time ruined
"another vid of cops killin... oh no nothing to see here... nothing to be learnt from this either"
Look at all these deadly joggers.
america moment
Is this real life?
wtf.
America does not need _gun_ control legislation.  America needs _anti-savage_ legislation...
Woow those nordic people are it again !! Where  are the comments from the left ? What about king lebum ? Blm ? Reverend such and such ? No one ? Crickets !! I see how it is just when the popos take down one of the felons then city burns , but kids killing others kids nobody cares right ?
Stupid funny tiger
people are afraid to fight now a days .
It’s getting old. Getting kind of sick of the minority of the population destroying freedom!!
well, clearly we need to ban water guns now.
Isaiah 53:5     “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”
And that is why we shouldn't allow them in our water gun fights.
What’s going on all of my blacks peoples…we are under attack by none blacks and we keep doing bull💩like this blacks on blacks…it’s over for us…stop the bull💩and come together 😡😡😡😡😡✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Now everyone that was playing basketball should be charged along with him. They're all responsible. This is how you stop these group attacks. They all guilty by accusation.
Rip
At least they are legal owners of that gun they "borrowed" from a friend... Hmm. Seems like gun laws really work.
People are getting violent for the dumbest reasons
He loaded the wrong ammo
Wtf is wrong with people ???? 1st this and now another killing over yard clippings
Wow , you cant just have fun no more
Where's that group that usually protests when cops occasionally shoot thugs? If they say one group's lives are special, why don't they get all riot-y over these daily murders of the special lives?
Soo we need more guns to be safe..right?
Thats iger AF.
Maybe it was just a matter of miscommunication?
I believe as a target human hearing voices(nanotechnology and the people) All Mass shootings are people being targeted with voices, not sqyitsofrenia. As a targeted man hearing the voices, they tell me they let the world be as it is because they can. Remember, who profits from death??
wtf is wrong with people
Wow....look at the news woman. She is gorgeous.
Pretty sure that's a no gun zone so, it couldn't have really happened,,,,,,🤔
That’s typical in those neighborhoods
The gunman didn't liked to be splashed with water.
Anywhere darker shade people gather, problems are bound to happen.
"Allegedly shot"  Dude is on tape, pointing a gun at the man who was then shot. That's not what "Allegedly" means.
time to ban evil water guns
Anyone waking up yet?
Make parents responsible for their children
Somalia?
In a word: pathetic.
USA is definitely a different world
AW What a shame !!!
They just can’t act right
That fence around the enclosure doesn't look high enough to keep the visitors safe. I won't be going to that zoo.
People  kill each other as if they don't know there are consequences to killing people
Water fights are awesome! Don't go a mess up a good thing.
Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called sons of God  whoever says we dont need God is unwise in the extreme
Never seen anyone shoot a gun like that
﴾֍﴿‭‭‭‭‭‭‭‭‭‭‭‭
Sad. Them kids where genuinely just being kids and some older kids walked up to them to start trouble and kill one of them. Why do you need a gun at the basketball court? Just sad
How you gone bring a pistol to a water gun fight
SMH
Soft soft soft soft.
Fake news story
When it's rap star celebrities... it's glamourized
we always killing each other
They couldn't just let the kids enjoy themselves...SMH
Dumbest things in the world seem to happen in Atlanta recently 🤦‍♂️
Gloves 🥊🥊 not slugz brother! Handle that thing in the ring 🔔 R.I.P. To the young Man 🕊. Prayers for all involved🙏🏽.
Wanna stop the violence? Throw every democrat in office out. They are supporting the violence. Calling it cultural diversity.
Put those guys hanging out with the shooter in jail too
Great parenting, schools, and community leadership there.
That is so sad. They were just being kids before they had to go be adults
Blm!!!! Oh wait..
Be safe
Brought water gun to a gun fight
BLM making things safe, GOOD JOB
Hold this L
Niggas to hard to have fun and play with water guns had to have a real gun who brings a real gun to a water gun fight
C’mon, just boys being boys. I’m sure it was a mostly peaceful shooting. BLM will be there immediately with support for the families. Isn’t that what they do?
Alleged?????
Still tribal.
If i were the Government, copy what the Saudi Arabian country are doing, or the country of Dubai and Singapore. Get rid of people right away without them going to prison. That way we eradicate useless people living in this world.
Can the on going effort be to offer free shipping to Africa?
The thumbnail looks like it took on calculator
Do these criminal idiots think they live in their own world?  They shoot people with dozens of witnesses and cameras. Do they wake up thinking, " Time to go to prison?"
At least it's all one race so no racism is involved. Keep it simple.
Wilderbeasts having fun.
In Atlanta?! No way! Really?!😶
These comments really disgust me. Like honestly
Where is BLM at?
Wow.
only in America
Can't even have fun that's sad
Savage.
Hmm..lebron ?
welcome to MuRiCa
This why we need better gun laws 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Man why they trying to blame this on the water guns? Weird choice for a title. it was a personal beef.
“Allegedly shot”... we see him shooting the gun lol
Probably got hit by a water ballon and had his ego hurt.
Need some holy water
BLM 👍
'murica!
14,9,7,7,5,18,19
Upstanding Obama voters or Biden voters
Young men with such high emotions.
One thing you don't do is have a water fight....playful as it might be..... around people's vehicles. That was stupid in itself. Stay away from parking lots and people's vehicles. Too much can go wrong even a simple scratch on the paint from a plastic water gun.
Wtf
This culture should be the model for all cultures.
I hate my people
Don’t think I’ll ever water gun fight ever again in this age.
Humanity going to the right direction
😪😥☹
The usual suspects. 🙄
His Gun and his Water Gun were right next to each other in his car.  They’re both the same size and color…  He grabbed the wrong one! Simple mistake.  😅  Just a chunk of lead vs water….  Nothing a bandaid can’t fix!!! 👌👌👌🩹🩹🩹
Lmfaooooo
Thats like bringing a grenade to a snowball fight
He got on his tippy toes haha real gangsters nowa days doing ballet when pulling trigger hahaha
See vaccine shots making people  act like wild animals
Seriously?
Ok i dont mean its funny i mean its silly but sad and like wtf but hehe
This is kinda funny
Where's blm on this
Ahhhhhmericaaaaa
now this is clearly because of the water gun fight... If there's click bait in you tube there news bait in news
But BLM right?
He's just sad he never got a watergun
Dat new$ women wife material hand$ down i bet $he $poiled wit love
Wow seriously So a water gun fight started a fight that person that pulled out the gun man your as dumb as them come. Starting something for nothing. Now you killed somebody and for nothing. Loser you will pay.
Where's the BLM riot?? Still waiting!!
I know, I know.  Don't bring a water balloon to a gun fight.
WTF...Growing up should not be this way...The kids playing with squirt guns,that's cool.It's for fun.But when you draw real guns to resolve an issue.That's just foolish.What happened to respect for one another?Or yourself even...
All fun in games until idiots start putting hydrochloric acid in water guns
Why am i not surprised about the race of the participants..
Because of I phone 📱 generation Tik tokers and on ( crypto world 🌎) to smash beef take it on the side where there is no cameras 🎥
We all know who these people are let's not sugar coat it. Now the idiot can shower with the rest of the boy's for the rest of his life.
Murica.... Where most people own guns and most want just to shoot stuff...
Bruh wtf is going on i know we had crime or have crime but something is off were there other side effects we didn't know about covid people are getting killed for things that supposed to end in a apology or a my bad smh
Mannn thats crazy most these kids are punks nowadays...quick to take a life
If you shot someone carrying a squirt gun you're looking for trouble have fun getting pounded in the ass!
Blacks are very intelligent.
Sad☹ just trying to have a good time. But we all know the type people having a good time our Target🎯.. for those who are jealous or just basically mentally ill can't stand the fact that people are having a good time...
Man people cant even play with squirt guns with firing real guns...but yeah lets Defund The Police we dont need them...🤨👌
The hell is wrong with this species. The virus isn't enough for you all to get a grip?
Just the typical & Norm but yet we have to listen to BLM spoo there stupidity 🙄🙄🙄
Bet you $20 90% of these kids are raised without a father and the Grandmother is doing the best she can!
Where is BLM??
Get ready for BLM protests
Always got to be a coward that can't fight
13 percent of the population really showing out.
I’m just done with believing in humanity.
Colored folk doing what they do best. Welcome to Joe Bidens America.
smh.
Oh Atlanta. No surprise
Someone probably did not like them hitting their car with water balloons and running in between them and hitting it with the plastic guns.
America is TOO gun crazy. And it WILL get worse with all the gun freak states encouraging more gun carry. True story - two brothers lived together. They had an argument - something normal. There was a gun handy. This was in Orange Park FL, 1985. One brother dead and the other in prison. If there was no gun, but America is so gun crazy it is sick.
Big babies!
What a bunch of jokers
They were upset they weren't invited to the water gun fight
Killing someone over an argument. Why are there communities like this. You kill someone at a park while they’re having a water gun fight was it really worth it?
Garbage people
Watery but mostly peaceful murder.
Maske more guns available and more people who should not have them will
BLM BLM LOL love diversity
Nah only sec,mins,hour change,now these crazy mfs out here thats the change
Another “ when BPs go wild video .”
Weeds or society 🤔
People love a car more than life . Bet they got water on a car they got even in there eye 👁
People like him usually don’t make it in prison lol he is going to get his wig split and cheeks taken.
Don't tell me ! he just combed his hair , and the water sprinkles made him do it..
DA FOO FOO POWA!!  🦧🦧🦧🦧
Bye bye, have fun in jail for a long time
What is these woman giving birth too?? Some monsters
Only in Atlanta
Always take your gun I have to get my lil nigga a gun cuz everyone thinks they gang
Fucking sickening 😪  ...just why?
Ok so this had nothing to do with the watergun fight. Of course the news makes it sound like someone just started blasting on random kids having fun, but the police made it clear that the groups knew each other and went to the same school. They started fighting because obviously they had beef and then that led to the shooting.  And no this isn't a comment on the kids who were having the squirt gun fight simply on how the news twists things to try and make it more "juicy" instead of just telling the actual story.
Gang violence, just call it what it is.
I'm not surprised.
Them:aight let's have a watergun war That one guy:aight imma use real gun
I've changed my mind about carding, card everyone and search everyone.
Thing is crap like this aint the first time happening. The water gun fights between teens usually turns out to be gang members or rival groups and usually end up violent. The waterguns in schools etc should not be allowed. We all know some people can’t do anything without getting violent.
👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
When do the riots and looting start?
looks like someone wanted some fun alright.. tempers are bad! this young man will be behind bars for the rest of his life. violence starts with stupidity.!
Why did they bother those other kids tho?
😂😅🤣😭😅😂😂😂🤣
nonWhites be like.
Minding their business playing with water and then the losers show up. smh.
This killing has to stop. Whatever happened to the BLM?  Guess it's like "Say No To Drugs" in the 80ies.  Just catchy t-shirt slogans. So Sad.
In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
dear lord these anchors just keep getting sexier Ron Burgundy your contributions will never go in vain i salute you good sir!!!
The most violent race strikes again.
Dumb
Well if they were to mind there own business and would have stayed on there side of the parking lot none of this would have happened.   Hopefully they give him life in prison.
You can spot people like that easily, they walk up lookin angry and lost for no reason. That'll be the guy, every time.  This didnt happen because of the watergun fight i see some fools didnt watch the whole story
Bet they were melanated kings
You could feel their bad energy as soon as they walked up.
Bro...😑 Dummy!
Say Jolets name BLM !!
damn it! Who the hell brought a gun to a water pistol fight
You can’t fix stupid.
Morons
Can we stop paying the least equipped mothers to birth litters of these future criminals.
So the water gun thing has nothing 2 do with the shooting
Notice a common thread with all these shootings?
No surprise when they showed the shooter.
How do Highschool kids have such easy access to Fire Arms?
give him the chair
Wow... I dont even like going out without people I know are Karen's or Steve's tbh. Karen's are underrated very underrated they are at least not crazy in a deadly way. Only some crack ass Karen's but honestly most just want meth.
People at this point die for things so minor people out here are too trigger happy they get a gun and just look for a little excuse to use it
Imagine being so stupid and unable to control your impulses that you think shooting someone is an acceptable action in this scenario. There's some crazy people out there.
Blacks have went regression in evolution ion& I don't even believe in that .
One is dead, another's life is destroyed. Schools and parents need to teach children some real values, no the ones that are being taught these days.
Can't believe people rather make their homies proud by being "tough" instead of their mommas proud smh
What Lives Matter??
People on Welfare and Food Stamps have way too much lazy time on their hands.
this is all fine if they're dying faster  than they breed
No Special Interest groups show up to these places......because there's no money to be made by lawyers and people of interest.
Sad :( R.I.P
privilege to kill
brought the wrong gun
IT SHOWS MOST OF THESE PEOPLE are stupid.   Here this has nothing to do with the color of your skin.  It has everything to do with you being a failure
It shows that all of these people were idiots lmfao
What a waste of life
prime example of a true hero and leader of his community what a fucking animal
Blm n full effect...
"I SAID NOT TO SQUIRT ME WITH THAT SOAKER OR IMA SPRAY THE UZI ON YOU"
We all know the common factor here
If you done got a gun,you can done kill someone intentionally,then you done.
All of this gun violence... Water gun violence. We need stricter water gun laws this instant
Can’t believe people are willing to throw their lives away over something so stupid lol. I mean if your gonna be a criminal atleast don’t get caught on your first crime 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
BLM huh?
JUSTICE FOR THE STUDENT & LIFE FOR THE MURDER!!
blm ,tell ...
The adventures of pookienrayray from the commun-a-tah 🤣😂😂😂🤣
Have fun ruining your lives, muppets.
Seriously it’s only water even if this guy got sprayed by accident just go somewhere else you know everyone is playing around you don’t wanna get wet move Along...big like some people stated in the comments he probably took it to the heart like that disrespected him seriously your 20 years old have some fun....unless there was something else going on maybe they had beef for something else that happened but I really hope that he didn’t take someone life cause he got wet...either way he ruined his life and took someone else’s life very sad story
Just like with Ricky in Boyz in the Hood.....smh
Now the cops believe they have a right to take over the park, in the pretext of safety. What happens???  More innocent people get shot, beat up, thrown in jail, the list goes on... Simply clean up the trash and things will be copacetic.   Don't need or want more wanna be thugs hangin around.
im just here to say... BUT BLM THO?!...that is all
When “This song makes me want to bring a gun to a water gun fight” turns serious
Just sad, Kids can't even be kids anymore!!!
bunch of old heads here clearly not a watergun fight turned deadly there was other beef
That walk up by the other group woulda made me call the cops sorry. Looks like fun introduced to trouble
Was this caused by the greatest threat to America Biden speaks of?
when they commit murder they should just kill themselves and save everyone the trouble and taxpayer coins.....this has just gotten out of hand....
Rip
It be your own people lol
Low impulse control.
Coming to a community near you!!!   Let the police do their thing. I bet a good officer would have taken this guy off the streets asap.
He got water on my Jordan's fam..... now I look like a fool out here with wet Jordan's with my whole underwear showing. He HAD to die bruh. Made me look stupid.
Enjoy prison, stupid.
Imagine thinking you’re so cool and tough you murder someone to impress your friends just to get caught and go to jail forever ! Idiot
My word or comment will mean nothing! The world has gone INSANE!!!!!
The deadliest it would be was blasting the hose at max power not using guns
Damn these people don't know how to have fun anymore..smh
I thought BLM though
so. how many times we have to watch this untill we get a background and mental check on gun owners?
And america STILL sells guns to kids... Smh 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Sentence him to life.
ohh just fools wanting to be cool huh
Real nigga in jail ot decent human being that's free. You make the choice.
this group of children are just quiet and peaceful
Hahaha
Idiots with guns.
Don't bring a water pistol to a gun fight
Keepin it ghetto
BLM
About time they start identifying the criminal again
Then we wonder why everyone is so mean to blm
he was just protesting peacefully
Blm
Shawn, better pucker up to be someone's boyfriend.
They keep talking about solidarity , peace,  that their lives matter , that they are being hunted.  This situation is the real truth that happens on a weekly basis yet not one word is spoken about it as if the real truth is hidden. Everyone knows.
Seems logical
Some people just hate to see other people happy, no matter how "gangsta" you are, you can always still be a hater...
satan stealing souls daily... off to hell they go! Sad
Movies say america is great!!  Reality says you better stay in Europe, america is a shithole
Single mothers trying to raise boys without a Father figure and failing miserably. This is blood on Feminism's hands.
👎🏼👎🏼
Dude.... Wtf?
Real talk it was all ego he got water squirted on him and was like wanna see a real gun fire
These people are the reason why kids have to play inside
BLM? 🤷🏿‍♂️
Cant scrap for sht, probably started the sht, but got mad and pulled a gun because his mouth and fists werent enough!  Seen this many times…those who start sht and then shoot after someone gives it to them should be murdered in public like they used to do in old days
Only in the hood
joggers gonna jog..
I don't have anything productive to say..........
Jijijijiji,  what do you expect they are raised that way,!!
Put him under the jail
In the hood someone  always wants to smoke someone else just because they need to prove something. never made sense back in the day still don't make sense but steet life never ends different people different weponds and same BS
BLM or no BLM?  Make up your minds.
Maybe he thought no one would notice it was a real gun among all the water guns so he took the opportunity to get a kill in, then if he got caught he could just say I thought it was a water gun 😉But then again he's probably just too dumb to even think that through.  😒
Hell yea! Thug life!! No Ragrets!!
Lebron says? Defund the police?
Straight to jail. .  . Don't Pass Go  and no you are not getting that $200 on your books. Play dumb games when dumb prizes. Keep that same energy in prison homeboy!
Wow it gets this deep to shoot so sad ! Something so innocent to violent!!!
How can you live with an ego so big to the point you don’t care about freedom.
democrats will be democrats
What should’ve been innocent and fun turn deadly. How can getting wet make u that angry
Something really needs to be dome about these Amish kids, they are really getting out of hand.
Need MORE GUNS to make things safer. More guns, guns guns guns. More guns
He probably hit his car with a water balloon or sumn smh . Reason I stay to myself.
And this is why they want to get rid of us!!!All of us!!! Are young people are so misled
Those kids with water guns? I could have predicted that outcome.
He gonna say I beeeeze didndonuffin!
So if basket ball playing person with the gun allegedly shot the person that is now dead, then has the dead person just allegedly been killed?
Everybody who has a gun thinks they're tough smh, grow up. What an evil child, lock him up for a long time.
Somebody sprayed someone elses new J's 😂
He must’ve wanted to be a rapper, now when he gets out, he will have a hit.
Everyone in the basketball group needs to be charged with something...
But but BLM said blacks don't kill each other only the police do
Guns again.
ain't no water gun in prison.
How ghetto is your life that a simple water fight turns into the hunger games? This is the problem when young people are given nothing but excuses and NEVER made to take responsibility for their actions.
Can't simply have fun these days without someone coming along flexing....
BLM lol
When the quiet kid (now in his 20's) pulls up to a water gun fight
'Basketball players' good job Lebum
Lames!
This is why water guns need to be banned, they lead to violence...
Any word from blm? Oh, that's right, never mind.
Nobody can help us unless we help ourselves, we killing ourselves
The murderer parents failed him. I feel like they should be jailed too. Get mad because you got squirted with water. The devil is in these new age children.
That's So sad,He Was An Egotistical Jerk ,
Shitbags.. Having a good time and laughing but no can't enjoy your selfs. Those dudes need to go to prison and find out what a good time really is!!!
Trigger happy scenario..  just wanted to look cool/tough in front of everyone with a gun. Ego at its finest. Very sad..
damn no one shoot back? If i was there i would of soaked there ass
Gub goes bang bang bang bang bang.
Here I am in my older age and it’s just suffering to see all these kids pass away without getting to accomplish their whole life.
He had a new gun he wanted to show off to seem cool.
Damn how many people were packing at this basketball game?  So sad, kids just can't be Kids anymore...😪😩💔
In the Caribbean we have a saying Fun does bring burn!
Let’s blame the nra and the second amendment.
So senseless!!
5.G.
Description of the shooter?...of course not.
Deeequan....and his sister Papareeka....
Normal?
He’ll have plenty of time to play basketball now
You are looking at the ultimate douchebags right here, why must you take hand guns to play b-ball? If you're having to carry a gun to go to the park or basketball courts you might want to check your life choices, you're the problem not the solution to your neighborhood! 🤦¯\_(☯෴☯)_/¯
Why couldn’t they just stay on the fucking court I’m tired of us killing each other over fucking nothing
Always an element gatecrashing with single boorish aim to F things up for everyone else. Happen this interloping bunch felt 'personally aggrieved' that folks were having fin wuth balloons and toys.
Ban water guns! LoL 😆 murder is already Illegal criminals don't care.
The fxck happened to my country all the kids are ghettofied these days. Maybe I was lucky in the 90s it was about BMX bikes making ramps, Walkie talkie nerf gun and water gun/balloon fights and goldeneye 64. Smh so sad. I'm a blxck btw
His mom said he can't get wet
Bro there kids let them be kids like you just killed a kid cause he was having fun with his friends
Only in bl-k culture. Imagine a world w/o...
But he was such a good boy says the family.
This is very common in individuals with low IQ’s.
RAP music is huge planned proponent to keep private prisons packed with cheap labor for young ducks like these to adopt a toxic subculture that pretty much obliterates any hope for a sound healthy family life in their often short lived futures. TRAGIC
It's always happening in these communities. They have absolutely zero empathy for human life. 🤦🏼‍♂️
the sad thing is he'll be out of prison in just a few years and be even more volatile. bring back public executions.
Very sad situation.
It seems to me the shooting was not over a water gun fight, one group was indeed having a water gun fight. Then another group came up to them, outside of the water gun fight group, and someone got shot. That’s not the same as someone on the water gun fight group shooting another in the water gun fight group.
What do all these high violent crime areas all have in common? They are all run by the Democrats & they all want to defund the police.
Those people are ridiculously violent you can't even have fun with them because of their animal like nature.
You gotta keep 'em separated
He’s handsome and gonna be somebody’s chick RIP YOUNG MAN
you act like an animal you get locked up like one!
What a wonderful community. Shawn Allen’s family must be so proud.
Water fight to a gunfight sad smh
When a man can’t handle the putang  hanging out with other men He checks out one of the other man and then checks in a few days later to do 20+ years with the whole gang of man and zero putang. No purpose. No life.
Amuuuuurica, hell ye, brudder
Group on the left looks like they were raised by loving parents, group on the right- MAMA probably said go get me some money so I get my hair did.
I predict a lot more squirt guns in this boys future.
Relief of parents/kids having fun for kids without deadly encounters? Capitalistic entertainment facilities that claim to be PARKS for children to laugh/play/feel safe, have to contribute a % toward inner city park-like (equivalent on fun and security) areas. I know that sounds absurd; a single thought, then mob mentality, forced democracy since we live in an actual republic, make the social media, and then just a whisper as the next fun murderous fact arises that did not affect you personally. Foreshadowing... paid yearly taxes, paid to gov, to be forced to create legislative non-profits voted/governed by people can now simplify the lobbyists, municipalities, future investments/indebtedness, mafias, geographical significance,  but NEVER scientific information. That was always true and manipulated by the rest.
" Hmmmmm?? I wonder how I could lose my freedom and shoot an innocent young child ?"
BLM
Mf America
Failed Parenting
This is the schools fault for not sorting out the situation from between those groups. If they are adults then it's entirely thier fault, but if thier are kids fighting gang groups then it's the parents and schools fault.
The most dangerous demographic
If only there was a social worker there who was trained in violence de-escalation, this horrible tragedy could have been avoided 🙄
typical
Crack lives matter.
These kids wild
Why? Words you can take back punches you can take back but you can’t bring back a life once you taken it. What is wrong with people?
Low impulse control animal.
Cuz...  SO the BIG BOYS werent PART of the water fight?!?  Fuckin MEDIA. I SWEAR MANN....
Imagine being so stupid that you’re willing to throw your whole life away just to show a few people how tough you are.
*NINJAS WANNABE NINJAS FOR LIFE IN PRISON.*
Party Pooper
Lack of parental guardiance and purposeful role models
Damn we can't have fun anymore can we? What kind of person ruins a water gun fight?
Another loser in life killing kids. What a bleeping bleep bleep
Wtf like it's a water gun... Supposed to be fun..
Idiots.
Worldstar !
The worst sore lower at a water fight.
wtf
I thought BLM why are blacks killing other blacks on a daily basis?
They should hire security guards to patrol these parks 24/7.
Only in the good Ole USA 🇺🇸!!!
Wow… when did life stop being important. He was enjoying himself and minding his business and for what? Senseless. My heart hurts for his family I could only imagine
God people always got to ruin a good time
They should do an in depth bio on the shooters life and try to find out why someone would do such a senseless act and end a young persons life so callously , like swatting a fly !
Wow Wild beast will always be a wild beast.
Dialogue means wyt ppl talked to blk religious leaders about telling their ppl to chill the heck out lol. Let’s be real here.
Ridiculous
Wow the real live Will Smith Story!   "In West Philadelphia Born and Raised".  On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
Ignorant people.
Can't even have a watergun fight without someone dying what the hell guys :[ RIP Daquan Gillet.
Culture to be proud of
Omg
Joggers are now Basketball Players.. we knew that already.
Look how messed up america is and they tk bout other countires
Damn things have to change for the better, that's supposed to be a good fun time not a murder scene 😢 this generation is trigger happy and really don't play by any rules
more to the story . we'll never know
Seriously?
I mean who cares. Loved seeing a thug killing another thug.
Reparations?
Dude looked shady walking up!
Yep ops normal.
Dropped handgun must’ve been a SIG 🤣
*Time to bring back public executions.*
Low IQ
Dude is a lame. Should’ve squared up if there was a problem
i swear we just did this in my city a few days ago
they just tryin have fun before the adult days  now they cant have the adults days
All cultures are beautiful.
Young teens with no guidance..
Hey kids!! You want to go to the park?? HELL NO!! YOU TRYING TO GET US KILLED?? NICE (NOT!) NEIGHBORHOOD!! ..YOU CAN'T BRING THE FAMILY ANYWHERE CAUSE OF TRASH EVERYWHERE!!!!
Isn’t there a law prohibiting blacks from owning any kind of weapon?
Sounds like a wonderful place. Said no one ever.
Ban basketball in America.. its to dangerous
Damn, the anchor woman is yummy looking. 🤤😛🥰
Lebron was right about them being hunted everyday. I guess it was open ended because Lebron didn't really specify who was doing the hunting.
"Former students" equals euphemism for drop out or expelled student.
🙄👍
Usual suspect.
I'm sure he was a straight A student too......lol !
Never fails there's always an animal ruining the fun ..
That man was a real G, Street Soldier!
Would have liked to have just watched the video play out instead bits here and there in no order.
Alright lock these animals up already forever please
Oh buddy knew he was going in straight rockhead
Fu(k that  guy let him rot in the filed picking corps
Joggers be joggin
Good grief, do they know anything other than basketball?
Knuckle draggers again.
Wtf
When people aren't taught to control their emotions
Why didn't his friends shoot back?
What a f—king joke. Jails Need to be built, and death penalties used, no excuses, this shits old already. We’re becoming a third world, life don’t matter.
I love feel good stories
I like turtles
Damn.. So many seniors not making to adulthood
People are so stupid

“Hey guys checkout my new camera! Oh wait... this isn’t the camera”

Media subscription of murder "suspect" : Basketball player.
Was that 2pac screaming THUG LIFE😂😂😂
This guy was jumping forward as he shot like he was giddy to do so.
Too many cowards in the world today
They really came from a basketball court to start sum bs😐
"Bro, You got my Jordans WET!.. Where's my gun"
Gone are the days when someone held your coat while you had a good old fist fight....... 🎵 I belong to Glasgow dear old Glasgow town 🎵
imagine almost graduating highschool just to get killed because of a water gun fight  Edit:I know the watergun fight didn't kill him
Sometimes you can’t play with folks. Sad but true
I truly hope we start trying to do something for these lost kids.  We have to keep the youth. I can't imagine the mom whose child made it to the end of school career then lose their life for playing with a water gun.
This is why the world doesn’t take America seriously anymore. Guns guns guns
Another punk will spend his time in prison being punked. 😂
WHO CARES 🖤
What a bunch of effing babies..over water guns???
BLM JUST PLAYIN
Sad stuff ... added himself to the pile of Historic MURDERER'S starting with Kaine slaying Able his beloved brother.
America and its stupid gun laws?
This is a big part of what’s wrong with the world today : (
imagine letting a gun protect you from a fade
Ban squirt guns !
Blm lives don’t matter untill we stop killing eatchother
He takes a life while also ruining his own life all because of a water fight?
She fine af
They're going to have fun with him in prison
What a weenie. Probably got mad his dusty ass Jordans accidentally got wet.
No, not in ATLANTA!
Come on man this needs to stop
Why be shocked when this is the way the US solves a conflict. People have been shot for playing loud music. Cops have shot people for questioning their detainment. People have been shot for walking in a neighborhood where they seemed suspicious. There are so many gun companies pushing their product by telling people be  ready for any problem. It used to be we got a problem let's go outside. Now the cowards don't want to take a beating.
What's the description of the suspect?
Im harder than u now ill prove it by spending the rest of my life in prison and talking up the butt forever
Someone bought the wrong gun 🙁
but,,,,,,but but BLM
Typical
I'm glad this doesn't happen in the country.
BLM
Damn people are stupid, like you would think people think like regular people, and thing about the consequences before they do something but they don’t they just shoot like fcking idiots r.I.p bro
Why would u shoot someone at a water gun fight 🤦🏽‍♀️
Arrogance  And pride led up to this.
lets ask lebron
Guns don't just "discharge" if dropped...
Around the world happens every second all day long every day and nothing will change because only criminal lives matter.
So bitch boy dropped his gun that accidentally shot someone then he took someone else's gun and shot another person? WTF???
wow... what has this world come to?
BLM.  Lol.
Send in some social workers.
Ion kno if this fr or not👀😂
What's the key element here
Time to cancel water.
All lives matter
LOL Never bring a water gun to a real gun fight, just like in an episode with Yosemite Sam with a toy gun against the swat team! XDDDD
you know you're a COWARD if you pull a gun on a fist fight.
That guy needs to be charged with murder and all the people who followed him over from the basketball court need to be charged with accomplice of murder... They went into a non violent situation and made it violent and deadly, if you put these people away for life you won't have to deal with it
Blaques will even turn a water fight deadly... Smh
Wicked kid
Let me pull the lever. Tired of these idiots.
How even
Who’s going to paid the family of the dead kid?
admin abuse
Cut of his hands
Catch and castrate = extinction of the trouble makers
Damn thats crazy... why didnt those gun laws stop that gunman??
Not my baby boy!! Ummm hmmmm🍗🍌
Crime scene photos.... Skirt gun tagged!😂
This is some kind of a f*****-up country. Guess what I it's going to get worst.
ITS A WATER GUN WHAT THE HECK  SOME PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID
Democrats be like: WaterGun Control🤔
I’m not going to form an opinion until Lebron and Dr. Faucci make a comment, at first glance it looks like two joggers, exchanging information about where bread can be had.
they kill each other over anything. guess those lives don't matter after all
These communities are deeply troubled.
This is why I’m debating to even have kids in this crazy generation of murderous people. I don’t wanna bring a kid into this insane fucked up youth. In constant fear if they leave the house they might get killed for saying hi to the wrong person or something stupid.
Sounds like the plot of a Boondocks episode
lol
Lol that's a crash out
When I see "Water gun fight turn deadly" i go straight to the comment section.
no protest with this shooting?
Not one BLM comment in the comment section?
We Wuz KANGS
of course , clayton county 🤦🏻‍♂️ … so much stuff has happened here so i’m not surprised
It’s all justified in the eyes that commit the crime until it’s time to pay for it. Guilt built up n he turned himself in or he realized he gone get caught anyway n turned himself in.
We keep making me sick and disappointed.
SHOULDN'T THOSE BUMBS BE AT WORK?? INSTEAD OF PLAYING BASKETBALL??
Let me guss.
No cops involved means no comment from Lebron.
Any word from sharpton?  Ben crump gonna represent someone?
TNS
2 lives wasted over nothing 😥
Where is blm?
SQUIRTGUNS MATTER.......
i dont understand the culture that promotes "if you get dIsReSpEcTeD , then you HAVE to react violently to prove youre not a bitch/punk "  someone is always going to disrespect you, call you names etc... but you cant go through life murdering people and think you'll last long
Yeah. I'm sure they all obtained their firearms legally. So glad we have major constraints in place for law abiding citizens to get their guns. Was that a weapons free school zone too? Maybe they didn't know.
Ignorance should not be tolerated, eye for eye.
Just just terrible, young people just can't have no fun without violence sad 😳🥺 you see them gathering stop fussing fighting better go the other way fast
BLM
You know those people that either graduated or dropped out, but never left the school area. I always hated them, and it's for nonsense like this. I think they're pedophiles, because they're always around younger people, trying to prove a point, which is how tough they are. Which I'm sure they wouldn't attempt on someone their own size or age.  Lock them up, the person that shot the kid, and every participant in passing the gun. Cowards
Welcome to Biden and the DNC's America 2.0
I thought they were gonna say some guy brought like a new high tech power washer that can slice concrete in half.
So sad that people cant even have a water fight without assholes taking offense in a deadly way
Drill music ruined his brain...
BLK PPL
Racist comments from fox viewers what a surprise
So we can't just fight, shake hands & live to see another day anymore, because of  cowards with guns who can't handle a lose. Now two kids are gone. Super sad.
No matter what the race, this is what happens when you let ignorant people procreate... ;-)
why i don't let my children play with them
Where's the cry out for justice here? Does it have anything to do with the shooter, who is somehow immune from hate for some unknown reason?
His father and mother feel shame for what he did.   I wonder if he has any idea of what he's done.
only americans could turn a water fight a full on real firefight
This is why ego & I are enemy's.
What a Clown
This is so sad
Great job single mothers! You don't need the baby daddy around.
BLM HUH
Man you cant even have some harmless fun at the beginning of summer anymore even as kids.
In America, even as a kid, you can't have fun without being shot straight down. Why do you want to live in such an unsafe country?
Mhmm
chicago atlanta an miami smh put the guns down
Maybe Xi ji ping should be running America , you dont see any of that continuous BS in China !
"my mom said I couldn't get wet today!"
I bet it was something as stupid like " who threw the water balloon that got my car wet?!!!" Unfortunately lots of families has lost love ones and prisons are filled with man who in a couple of seconds throw their whole life away cause of ego and this fake notion that you have to be hard all the time!!! It is sad😢
Mostly peaceful shooting
That idiot couldn't tell the difference between a water gun vs a real gun smh it's a shame he had to get involved
Smh wow....  Basketball vs water guns
Now he will take a fat one all the way in ..
Reading the tittle I thought it was gonna be some random dumb person seeing these kids have a water gun fight and think that it's a shootout and then draw his own gun and end up killing a kid.
Trash.
These cowards are so quick to pull a gun.
Easy.access.to.ar.shot.guns.legally.and...backsteets..fight.for.turfs.amoung.gangs.drugs.inslums..lunatics.having.guns.mass.shooting.well.come.old.west
Don't bring a squirt gun to a real gun fight.  The thug should have stayed on the basketball court with all the other drop-outs. Leave the high school kids alone.  Not your business.
Where's BLM? Oh wait the founder retired off the backs of blacks,making millions and millions.
Culture...
Welp... I OFFICIALLY can't go to Kenwood anymore. They done ruined that now too.
Oo they're going to jail for sure for sure. AT LEAST the shooter and the person who handed them the gun... the fact that he dropped his gun and STILL grabbed another one may be what they use to bury him under the jail then dig him up and bury him under the prison.  Had they minded their own business, none of this would have went down.
"Well now he won't be the shooter but he'll have plenty of shooting his way and ion think they gon miss either #wickedboy
Only in America 🤡
Gangs again...
Don't worry guys where he's going there's gonna be a lot of squirting.
This whole rap culture needs to go. That's what tells kids to take a gun to a basketball game. That's what tells kids to settle a squirt gun fight with murder. That's what tells kids to fight the police, and get yourself shot. Kids are too young to have that kind of garbage pumped into their brains. We need to get back to raising our children properly, for the sake of the kids and society as a whole.
Damn can't handle it with using your 👊
Never bring a Super Soaker to a gun fight.
Is it normal for you and your buddies to be armed whilst playing basket ball?!
I just want to thank the men and women in uniform, With all the criticism and backstabbing from the public incidents like this prove that the mainstream media is just pushing a fearmongering agenda.  God Bless and Protect Us All 🤝💙💯🙏💖
I hope he stays in prison for 100 years! I hate trouble-makers.
Just a peaceful protest here
Sad ending.
STUPID!!!!!🥺
No racial profiling going on here, just a typical fun time in the park.
Always the young dumb young men prayers for all
That’s a shame🙏🏾
Hey nick cannon what's up with all this melanin loving nature of YOUR people?
That punk is a coward behind a gun.
I say we do old techniques of execution like the stretcher and we do it live on television or something im sick of ppl getting shot for nothing so we gon show them the price for that. I really dont care at this point to really show the point any person related parents girlfriend can watch so the criminal can feel all types of emotions leave the worthless body
I bet he from a single mother house hold
Looks like a Tarzan movie to me....
🎥 gotcha
We can't have no fun these days
Not crime, peaceful protest from that future doctor...
Biggest rage
Maybe he mistaken his real gun for his water gun? Try that defense.
sensitive generation LMAO
Typical. Not surprised
It's water idiots....this is what they do, they live to kill each other over H2O...dummies
Eye for an eye seems appropriate
Usual suspects
Please remind me what lives matter??? Hahahaha
Welcome the 2021 teenagers
Damn those "basketball players" must really hate water guns
Yall do the country a favor and keep on keeping on.
JUST JOGGERS ACTING LIKE JOGGERS
Current and former students  come on call them what they are  there FUCKING criminals
Murder suspect how is he a suspect he literally has a gun in his hand and shirtless in 2k
Q: Who brings a gun to a water-gun fight?  A: A coward.
Blatt on blatt crime.... non-existing
One good boi killed another, and where are the protestors?  All of a sudden bl no longer m.
Toxic masculinity is a strange thing
Atlanta would be a nice place to live.
Homies getting his cheeks clapped rn
ONLY in Merica 😂🤣😂
some people should never have deadly firearms !
Atlanta is doing just great 👍
Pride will destroy precious Life! That's GIVEN from my SOUVERIGN GOD!  WHEN you  are not even justified in taking the Life. Aftermath, shouldn't be the mind regulater from temporary insanity! In THESE senseless killings.  Then you wouldn't have to have REGRETS.💯🙏🏾🙏🏻🙏🏾🙏🏻🌍🌎🌍🌎🌈🌈🌈🌈 PLEASE.
Heard all this years ago,still happening, but worse,these people are jokes
All in all, it was peaceful.
Because his ego now two lives are gone. Nothing new
Allegedly fired 🤔Don't you have the footage of him shooting
Total spineless cowards
"When Animals go bad"...
I lived near this miserable town for 2 yrs. It was the WORST place I have ever lived. Full of hateful ass people..  No one was ever happy.  I worked in retail and it was AWFUL there.. Goin out to eat or ANYWHERE was always a negative experience. So glad to be far away from that place. RIP to the young man he had a bright ass future and it was stolen from him & his family/friends. Try being nicer humans!
I thought ATL was gonna be the new Harlem.
Shamful , cant have fun these days , the real crazy thing is Shawn Allen had to know he was on camera damn goofy
Their fathers never taught them coping skills or respect.  Oh wait....
Evolution, it's not for everybody!
What races were these fine gentlemen students?
Joggers yet again
Why tf  are 20yr olds hanging around high schoolers?? Losers
Where’s BLM?
America sounds like the scariest place to live in
must have been systemik racism. WHICH RACES HURTS YOU THE MOST? ya your own.  protest that dummies
hmmmm what led to the violence? probably miss managed children and blm projecting violence and riots as a responsable solution.....
rip homie
Man my senior year was so fun water guns and all even the teachers joining in....this world gets sicker by the day
Give the whole gang free guns in an isolated area away from normal people, the mess should clean itself up pretty quick!
Some people just aren't playing...
Any idiot can pull a trigger , be man , throw hands ,not  bullets !!
Can't even have a water gun fight anymore! So frikn sad!!!
Seriously?   People are fucking crazy
so no school security from stopping random groups of people from coming onto school grounds?
I bet you never hear about this again.
Totally immature guy who shot other guy GROW THE FUK UP🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. .........RIP to the guy shot🙏🏻🌈🙏🏻
BLM real quiet
Only meeting that helps is a sit down for the gang to discipline that boy
What a way to throw your life away
These idiots are the reason that I can't, don't and won't go anywhere without mine !!!!
U not hard if u use a gun. There is no men today. Bunch of pussies with guns. Fight like real men, not a fake ass soldier
I can see why the nominee to head ATF would want to ban assault water guns.
I swear us introverts are better off as we are
Can we make execution public?
on this episode of 60 days in
Lebron say they are being hunted….  99% of the time by their own..  but he only talks about the 1%
United States of Greed
This is why I had to move from Georgia 🤦‍♂️ they have no regard from life
Moronic thugs.
Such low life’s !!! What happened to fighting with your hands why shoot to kill like a coward
BLM ✊🏿 right  😏 let them let self disrupt
We need water gun background checks!
Start giving them life with no parole no visitation rights no phone calls no light just total darkness for the rest of their lives make these vermin beg to be put down like the worthless pest they are
Netflix should come out with a show called “When They Come Out” and show what happens when they come out 👀
This culture is the ONLY culture that would do some ish like this. Ridiculous.
Once you graduate high school, it’s time to stop being around high schoolers
hope he gets life without parole. smh.
Kids trying to have innocent fun,  Then the POS's show up and ruin everything... where's the outrage?? BLM???.. didn't think so..
Yup, we don't have a gun problem in the USA
Its called a "gang fight". Catch up geniuses...smh
Cops are quick and great with footage not against them.
What a waste.
Show me your friends???? And I'll show your future!!!!!!!
Killing people over water really???? Coward
You shouldn't be allowed to show any of this video if you can't show the whole thing 👎👎
I knew what race it had to be just judging on the title of the video. Lol.
Defund & abolish the police!!!
But no protests right?
He's so dumb ego got the best of him
What an idiot pull a real gun in a water gun fight
🇺🇸 💩 🕳
For the safety of other people; please lock him up for life.
Apparently lives mean jack.
Imagining spending a whole year locked down... finally can see your friends, and this happens?
Lock him up or else another victim will suffer.
Damm we can’t even  have water guns  fights  no more  🤧🤧
Welp, hood violence, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM......
defund the police, BLM
Friggin coward.  Not much of a man.
Parents, due your diligence by not raising  Punks!
Basketball Americans at it again
18-40...thinking you really might get an appeal or parole. 40+...just hoping god saves your soul. RIP to the victim and RIP to the shooter. Sad.
Only in Atlanta
Smfh this doesn’t make any sense to why tho ?
DEFUND THE POLICE LOL
You want to "clean thing up"??? Simple, shoot them execution style after conviction.  No more jail time/community service or wasting tax payers money.  Americans are getting fed up but more are too scared to say anything.  Enough is enough!
He lost some money on the court so he was already mad 😡
0:52 like.... I cant help but laugh seeing this pop up as a crime scene photo 🤷‍♂️
Any rally? Or protest? Any celebrity reverends or politicians come to town? Nope!!!
Remind me again, so how does systemic racism affect the African American community?
Also ...too many comments about the “water gun fight escalating” ... you’re stupid if you believe that’s what happened here ... I agree that it was senseless violence .. but I doubt it had anything to do with the water Guns ... that was a news spin . Come on now
“Allegedly” ... Come on bruh 🤦🏽‍♂️
I see a reaccuring theme here> I cant quite put my finger on it tho.
“Wypipo be so jealous of our culture”
Around ......, never relax
A fun day full of youthful memories they won’t forget turns into a tragedy they’ll never forget.  Lock up that ahole for life and throw away the key.
I CAN EVEN READ LIKE, HONOUR, LOYALTY, ORDER BUT, IS THAT APPLAY'S TO THE COUNTY'S RULLE'S UM ???👊🤓PUNYETA...
Welcome to America, we got a hood every 5 square miles 😎 enjoy!
Can't blame racism on this one
Where are their dads? Lol
"Never bring a water gun to a gun fight"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No reason whatsoever to turn violent.I agree with the below, got to start raising these kids better.
Joggers gonna jog. RIP America
This was a murder AFTER A water gun fight.   Stop being water guns into this.   Thats like saying "Shot dead while drinking  milk." Does the milk matter?? Did it have anything to do with the murder part??   So dumb!!!
Current students who want an education vs dropout thugs. Such a shame that this will never stop.
If he had warrants, he has a criminal history.  Why does our legal system (I refuse to call it a justice system because justice no longer exists) refuse to prosecute and sentence as the laws were written?  Instead, when someone commits an armed robbery, as an example, the prosecuting attorney accepts a plea deal reducing the charge to theft then the judge sentences them probation which allows them to return to the street to commit their next crime.  They should be charged with armed robbery, tried and if found guilty, they should be sentenced with the amount of time stated in the statute.
Prison and death clearly are not deterrents. A mandatory lifetime of hard labor, chain gang style might make at least some think twice.
can't even give them water guns. yeesh.
What you in for bruh? Water balloon fight gone bad...
Well THAT park needs more social workers, apparently.
ASTONISHMENT!!!
Bring back Corporal Punishment.
So uncivilized. Not surprised this happened. Who carries on like this in a parking lot...when they are practically adults?
promote segregation again
Some people just want to see the world burn.
Thugs are scum. 100%.
He mad no one invited him to the water gun fight. So he had to bring a real gun.
Home of the stupid. What a nice country not to live in.
Disrespect vs pride.  The underlying cause of so many needless deaths throughout history...
Still waiting for Lebron James to talk about this on social media.
BLM🤣🤣🤣
Cant have anything nice, can't even have a dang watergun fight
One more winner of the room temperature challenge!! Thank you sleepy joe and the democrats. Nothing from blm??
Just another day
In his quest to eliminate all Dequans!
When I was a kid, we wanted to get soaked on a hot summer day. This dummy gets mad. Bye bye!
I think it is racist to see this as anything but a celebration of the music and culture of our neighbors.
Dammnnn what a cutie tho!!!!!!+ 💗💓
You Kant fix stupid
POC are involved?🤔 Is this a pattern😏.
So stupid cant even have fun without someone else being a little baby because no one wants to play with him
If a bomb had gone off in the middle of that big jogger group it would have been a service to the community.
No dashcam?
American gun laws are fu*#ed
Another example of where childhood and youth has no place in the socialist agenda of the democrat elite. The perpetrator obviously went to jail an 'A' double 'S' hole, no doubt he's still living his wasted life with a 'manhole'. So be it.
“It was a mostly peaceful murder” -cnn
Man oh man , life shouldn’t end due to things like this , this man had a lot of problems in his head
That’s ridiculous what a loser time to go to prison
Please dont get mad at me but i laughed when i saw the title
I hope you get what is coming to you...you are nothing can't even fight so your fast to pull a gun tell you one thing there ain't guns in jail so hope you learn how to fight
These New Age Humans have more Feelings than Women. They Grab a Gun for Everything, not realizing that there’s No Guns in Jail, So what you going to Shoot in their?
What the fk is wrong with this dude?
They were some gud boys just going to skoo  says their mom
Guess bl don't matter haha  Guess they are being hunted by their own
Time to ban water guns
Not allowed to have fun no more.
Lock up never see freedom again because the deceased won't
standard 1,000 mile soulless stare of the perp
Surprised this even made the news for obvious reasons. Doesn't fit the democrat/left narrative.
WHERE’S BLM,CNN, Al Sharpton Benjamin crump Michelle Obama
The whole BLM narrative is working well I see.
he just brought the wrong super soaker that's all
Tired of my kind making us look bad😐
Wanna be gangster showing off to his friends.
Tons of Guns!!!!  Murica!
Wtf is a 20 year old doing with high school kids? I remember playing with cap guns, water guns, & even having water balloon fights all with kids my age or around my age though.
Pure stupidity. These people love killing each other for no reason
Ooobrothers!!!!😩
Thank God there are ongoing efforts......
And the wheel just keeps turning my fellow humans.
Brain dead useless violent hate is all they have.
These people are so dumb
"he called me a nigga" will be the next headline as he's worshipped by blm for killing some youngster.
PRIDE
Been like this for decades. They are their own worst enemy
So this group of kids see other kids being kids and having fun and decided to go over and start trouble for no reason that led to a death and this is why I'm scared when my 16 and 15yr old wants to go hang out because of these clout chasing scared to fight wanna be thugs that can't even shoot a gun right...R.I.P to that young man
"ongoing efforts to make the park safer for everyone." Sorry, but the only thing that'll help is changing the mindset of the people who go there. No laws, policy, rules, mandates, or anything else will change a single thing. I wonder how many of these kids have their father in the house...
I hate to say this,...but IM so angry right now,..if I were in charge there, I'd walk his mother out in a courtyard, in front of him,...then ask them both why he wasn't raised to be better.  Then I'd blame the mother, and execute her right there in front of him,..1 shot to the head.  Then I'd tell him HE did that to his mother. HIS actions got her killed.  "The pain you feel,..that's what youre putting your victim's family through right this very moment..".  Then I'd put the word out..  "To all GANG Members, Thugs, Drive By Shooters, Random Mass Shooters, Child Molesters, and Rapists. ALL of you 20 years old, and younger,...the very last person your actions kill, will be your parent or parents. Good People aren't going to be the only ones burying loved ones anymore. You'll be the death of your parent or parents, before you ever get shipped upstate to your prison.  Have a nice day."..  Evil MF's..
He looks so weak too little punk
Culture..inclusion.. sign me up?
blm doenst matter understand that
WTF !
Just sense rip
We will steam roll divided communities.  Americaisfkd
I honestly thought I was about to eat an onion.
Where's blm at? Oh yeah their only around for bs going on
Then a couple of guys who were up to no good. Started making trouble in my neighborhood
BLM
Keeeeeds
In the UK some people throw bleech and acid in your face,  squirting water on a person may seem innocent but, the person who is on the receiving end doesn't know if its water or not.  There's many things you can put in a water gun and do harm to someone with.  Raise your children correctly.
Daaaaaaaaaa water sprayer I meant to pull my firearm nobody shots water sprays water on me , ya right you people are not going to do anything about this th err res no curing stupid people what a bunch of fing hicks
so fucking sad. they were just having fun being kids :( high school kids.  heart breaking
You can’t even have a childhood in this “enriched culture”.
I wonder how hard he felt when he saw his paperwork that said release date 2077 or some stupid s#it.
Clearly Trumps fault for sure
And again...the usual suspects....People of a Dark Color
NO NEED FOR A TRIAL.
Nothing good ever comes from basketball
Gmo’d out
Big ego little brain.
Where is BLM?
Aren't young people in their late teens and particularly their early twenties a bit old to be entertaining themselves with squirt guns and water balloons ?
Seems like they like killing themselves more than police
Kids nowadays cant even have fun at Parks or anywhere outside without someone bothering them
this so sad
Wtf a squirt gun 🤣🤣🤣
where's BLM??
DId this happen in US? though so
Dang
All the BLM protestors avoid all these videos tho 🤫
So what of this story is supposed to surprise us? BLM. What a f'n joke.
"Living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land"
Imagine if work camps came back into existence, their homeboys wouldn't have things like easy time to talk about, they would talk about how much they hated it
Its his right to carry weapon and kill at will, isn't it? Now he will spend life in prison and that's that. Also the dead will never return.
That park is normally safe been there but 2 things.  1 our public education is failing kids so you end up with uneducated derelicts.  2) we dropped out standard of youth respecting adults.  I say that because I guarantee you prior to gun(s) being pulled there was a whole lot of back and forth cursing and disrespectful actions going  on with families in the park.
Anger, pride, and ego
What's sad about this is those kids were actually just being kids. People need to go back to fist fighting over disrespect issues.
Is anybody really surprised?
What? Water gun fight is not a proper title. Flag this video.  This is a fight that turned deadly.
This certain demographic is truly something else and not like the rest
So stupid
Wow is about all i can say 🤔
GOTTA LOVE THEM JOGGERS
What a dummy, don't drop the soap buddy.
Until GUNS are regulated properly, this s*** will continue all across the nation.
I lived there in the early 90s it was bad then .
Wow. How the hell do you play basketball with a gun in your pants???
BLM ?
Then we want them the look at us and treat us differently, smh
Chris rock had the right idea 🤷🏼‍♂️
First Channel, then Gucci, now Gillette?  I'd stay away from naming my child a brand name.
God damn talk about throwing your life away
That level of ignorance doesn't deserve to ever walk amongst us
"He was a good boy though"
Smh dudes scared 2 take a ass whooping so they bring a gun or quick to shoot this osh senseless at a school 2
I so read that title wrong smh I thought it said gun fight turned deadly 💀 im like that's usually how gun fights turn but then I seen water gun in the title
B P
Typical
Bro at this point I don't care how old you are. No one should be exempt from the Death Penalty. You murder - you die. Either by firing squad, the needle or hanging. *Bring Capital Punishment BACK*
True punks and afflicted vessel's. Weak
I dont understand the feelings of these boygirls, there emotions out of control, they think there in a video game where u can start over smh, there was no reason for approaching the group who was minding there own business
Wonder if BLM will show up for the meeting to make that park safer. I think it depends on how many news cameras show up...#photoop
Evil exist
well, you just destroyed your life. Was it worth it?
Man I'm sorry, but who's raising these sensitive, quick-tempered, crazy and mentally disturbed kids? These kids today, are nutty as a fruit cake.  Parents get it together, and turn off the negative rap music. Public Announcement:  If you know your child is a nut basket, get him or her some help, or keep them safely locked up, in the house. So that they don't hurt themselves or others. #RealTalk💯
What a massive douche
ninjas being ninjas
Mostly peaceful water gun fight.
Where is blm at now...? 🤷‍♂️ijs
we all know who cant fight, RIP to the senior man they were just trying to have a good time
Want to be little rap gangsters, then lock'em up for minimum 30 years! This cycle of stupidity must be put to an end!  Throw away ALL negative rap music! The crap is poison!
Fellow convict: “what you in here for?” Murderer: “someone squirted water at me so I shot and killed him”  🙄
This is what happens when you got a single mom raising them
This is America
U just never know what to expect in public schools #PERIOD I remember the end of 9th grade having water balloon fights but also kids with locks&rocks in socks to fuk each other up smh. We didnt have easy access to guns like they do now. We all have to help kids mindsets..ours and theirs!
Ofc a,black kid
The group of guys who went  to the parking lot where the other kids were playing should all go to prison. They created a situation just so they could make up an excuse to kill someone! This is disgusting!!
😭😭😢
I guess they don't believe BLM
Nah I’m too gangsta to have fun.
I don't see the wrong in this. Let them have at it. It's a win win. The problem solves the problem!!!
I think it's fucked up that this world has become so complexed that we almost can't raise our kids they're just being taught by the streets and dying in the streets are headed to prison.
Oh those are the guys you see on a BLM demo next month
Pride is deadly. It usually begins with a fight, in which both men are trying to prove how much of a "real man" they are. Instead of taking the loss, or even TRYING to fight...people are pulling guns and killing people. Pride.
Lmao Americans in a nutshell
He’ll surely lose his gun license for sure.
Get them gangs and all the members
Michelle Obama and LeBron James will tell you cops are more dangerous...
That news woman is a Georgia peach !
I like how he said former students, not graduates of said school.  😂😂😂😂.      Maybe we should address the real problems with society.   🤔
democrat policies in action. they love it when a plan comes together
People are loosing their mind and all the gun laws in the world WILL NOT change that.
Don’t bring a real gun to water gun fight.
Am I supposed to be surprised at this? It doesn't matter if it was a birthday party for a 6 yr old, would still result in the same outcome.
Death is a beautiful thing
Some more ignorant shyt
😂😂😂
So typical
BLM
This is an easy one to decipher. The kid playing with water guns wet the kid playing basketball and his new 200.00 pair of Jordans and wouldnt apologize so things went left. Typical behavior of today's kids bc of poor parenting.
Hurt people hurt people.
Yup BLM!
Idiots
These kids have guns because of the second amendment.
The stupidity is beyond comprehension!that's how stupid kids with knives and guns are these days killing each other over nothing effecting everyone's lives including their own the sad thing is they are probably all good kids,people need to value life above all else.
IDK why these goofys from the south try to be hard, ur from the bible belt fooly u had it good growing up so stop acting up!
Make me want to through up. I feel sorry for the victim and his friends who had to witness a funday turn into a death day. Clearly the accused and his gang walked all the way into the parking lot to look for trouble
Pathetic kids
No daddies means young men do not know how REAL men handle life. This is the result. Again & again & again...  #FACT
He thought it was a real gun fight
This generation just busting the doors open to the penitentiary. Just out here reckless saying pick me next to the laws.
Sad and shameful
It is what happens when the government run public school systems graduate complete morons that cannot even read or write as a way to steal more tax payers money which is the real problem them kids obviously had to begin with
He had absolutely no reason to kill that young man. Terrible. I'm praying for the young man's family.
All staged don't buy it !!!!
All crap to take away your guns !
America. Great country lol.
How did water gun fight simulator turn into call of duty? How?
Lebron informed about this yet? Lebron
Can't get any dumber than that.
50 yrs ago this wouldn't have happened, what a tragic way to lose your life in a waterfight
So sad😔😔. Kids can't even have fun anymore without a wicked heart showing up..
Blacks ? What
every single one of the people that came over with that group from the basketball court should be charged with accessary to murder
NOT using a gun is badass. Using a gun is a punk bitch move.
BLM is not available at the moment, please try again later!
Stuff like this angers me. But what angers me most is people who overlook this to push racist ideologies from both sides of the isle.  Sad a life taken for pure stupidity.
Get back to traditional families and drop the gangster mentality and you will see drastic change for the better. BLM opposes this , up to you to do the math .
CULTURE
Some people don't know how to act civilised no matter what
well i guess he had a really good reason to justify shooting ......... the way the world is going and the law is becoming so weak .... it will be the victims fault for being shot
One really has to wonder what train of thought goes through the mind of a murderer right before they throw their life away over something so incredibly trivial. "Wow.. yeah.. this water fight is so exciting I just gotta bust a cap in someone over here" That whole group came over LOOKING to start trouble... Being armed, hostile and part of a mob mentality, they sure as hell weren't asking if they could join in the fun.
He probably taunted the killer with the water
Oh great now there gonna ban water guns... FFS just take all the fun of life away!
Anyone in they're right mind can clearly see it's a set up for whoever was to be shot. Start a water fight, get others involved and the attackers non-chalamtly come up and bang-bang...busted by the cameras
I’m happy to see these people in jail they deserve it!
Let me guess he was a good man meant no harm has kids and a wife
Should have stayed his dusty ass on the other side 🙄
So buddy drops his own gun, shoots self in foot, than shoots someone else...
I don't know about you when I got out of high school I never went back just to hang out
The real crime is the News lady working as a journalist and not a Model
Let them kill each other for all I care.
The whole gang & wanting to be a thug lifestyle needs to be squashed. Shootings are almost guaranteed,supported and laughed about like it's a normal everyday thing. Just wrong.
So fox will take down my comment defending myself but leave up the one who offended me first!!🤬☝️
More than 3 i will not be
Here's another gangsta wannabe  acting like he's  the KING KONG of any situation... These kinds of people are the cancer and menace to SOCIETY.   Why the FK would he even think about going over there with a group of people to mess with these kids that were minding their own business?  He wanted to be KING FKN KONG, THE OG GANGSTA,, So now , it's,  FK YOU,,HAVE A GOOD RIDE TOUGH GUY,, OOPS I MENT, GANGSTA.. 🤣...WTF is this world coming to?
Public execution of the murderer that it would help a little bit. Oh by the way it would be a very brutal execution in my book the murder no matter what is not that tough
A Gun Didn't do this, a POS with zero respect for human life did this. 2A is ALL good people have to defend ourselves from punks.
Dude is a idiot you kills someone just to spend life in prison
BLM???
He shot the gun because he know he can’t fight. R.I.P to the senior.
Bruh....its like encountering a toxic kid in your "only-friends" pvp fight.  Real bullcrap man, they were just having fun.
Well......BLM sure made a difference 🤦🏾
Someone got dey Jordan's sprayed
Nice...
BLM is Bs people protest on this kids can't have fun
Kids can't have fun
Imagine being a person so insecure you kill someone for having a water gun fight
Lmao anyone else not surprised..?
Merica Baby!!!
He probably lose that basketball game. Now he can play in jail 😂😂😂😂 like what he wanted
This is heartbreaking, GOD bless and protect us always
Adults need kid supervision since they are so irresponsible!!!!.
The Democrats like AOC and Omar would slap him on the wrist let him out of jail without bond.
Want to make it safe, get rid of the joggers🙉🙈🙊
Real gangster.
Typical culture...
I'd watch the news everyday to see her 👀
BLM
Let me guess he was a good kid getting his life together he was going to go back to school /college he was changing his life around blah blah blah. SMH
Such a Gangster. Kills a dude having fun with other people. Kids nowadays stupid. I know a kid that made his mom loose their entire apartment for doing car breakings in a place where he really didn't need too and he also lived in. Now they in the streets with a drunk for a mom. Kids need to be taught better.
No one ever listen to the news he just said we need to have leadership in the community blah blah blah for the safety of the park bruh for the kids 🤦🏾‍♂️ people so stupid only heard shooting
The youth these days have no morals at all so sad 😢
0:58 he got the fake VM's lmao
We all know that one guy that brings a real gun to a water gun fight.
noticing a pattern yet?
Cmon bro what has this world come to.
My people need to stop listening to rap music
What's the common denominator??  SO SAD they can't all move in with the blm executive that used millions donation $$$$'s to buy a home in an upper class neighborhood
Remember that every bad thing starts with Fear.
What the f::::k is wrong with people?   Why are they calling them former students,  there gang members.  The only way this is going to stop is for good people in neighborhood to turn them,  i n  if  they see it smell it hear it , take your neighborhood back,  do it anonymously if you have to.
Killer basketball players!   You have to be a real low-life to bring a gun to a water gun fight.
This is sad😞😥 How can we as African Americans ever hope to achieve equality and peace in America if the younger generations refuse to wake up.😢☝️ Nobody can ever hope to receive any type of reparations if it's proven they can't even get along with one another😢☝️
Where BLM at ?
Dummy.
Lol. Way to live up to the stereotype.
Typical Jurassic park
SMDH
welcome to the USA today
Where is BLM?
Nothing but morons
Freaking cowardly humans need guns.
CNN.     Democrats L Sharpton been Crump and blacks
BLACKS and blacks
WHERE IS BLM !! O their is no one. To sue so !!!
Now I bet he is sitting in that jail looking stupid af! What a coward frfr! What happen to let’s just fight and get this over with? Why do it always have to turn into something deadly! This generation is sissyfied.
That's a mental disorder for sure.
Culture matters. Hope the shooter gets the death penalty, not an early release because baby daddy wasn't in the picture.
Register all water guns
Buck's shooting bucks
Who raised these little bastards
#defund the police
Clearly a gun problem 😒
The ones with the guns didnt update their iphone
Only in America eh?
🤡✊🏿🤡
That’s not a gun! This is a gun😃
It’s trump fault
Where is BLM ?
From plastic water guns to real firearms guess they wasnt playing when they said they go 0 to 100 real quick but seriously is it just me because my concern once again is the law enforcement example a large group of people at a public park engaging in fun activities example b units are around but none present at the park until the real gunshots get popped off or someone calls it in I mean seriously you guys this is not okay I know it's hard to judge kids just being kids but let's look at facts there's always someone watching especially in public with a large group of people why not have maybe 1-2 maybe 3 law enforcers around to scope out the scene while the park is open meaning stay in the park till it's time to clock out or either rotate shifts with someone else therefore situations like this gets avoided
How the hell a water gun fight turned into death they don't even know how to have fun
Stop "rehabilitation" start re domesticating.
How can a water gun fight turns into a actually real gun fight wow these ppl need to banned guns
It's the New youngsters nowadays
Everyone yells gun laws. when it needs to be addressed that over half these guns come from irresponsible parents not locking guns up .. from their kids..
Students? Apparently, they didn't learn a damn thing in school. Shame.
Where is BLM now? They won’t touch this as it doesn’t meet their agenda.
meow
Blacks cant even shoot water guns without getting all gangsta!
niqqa moment
poor gangxtas in the hood playing thug life
Denial, deceit and delusion. - CF
Murder is against god
🤦🏿‍♂️you cant even make this stuff up
joggers gonna jog
Disrespected
What a surprise
Fill in the blank. Give a gat to a _____, don’t know how to act
Proof these fools can't even have a water gun fight
Life didn't matter,  just his reputation as the baddest that ever sagged tight pants on playground
This crazy because Daquan my little sister boyfriend and it hurts my heart that his life was taken so short & HE DIDNT MAKE IT TO THE GRADUATION ‼️ ITS NOT FARE AND FOR A GROWN MAN TO BE AT A HIGHSCHOOL WATER FIGHT GIVE ME PEDO VIBES ‼️ THIS DISGUST ME SEEING THIS HOW IT TURNED OUT
2:41 this is what someone looks like when they throw away their freedom I cant imagine throwing it all away like this
I remember the end of my 9th grade year my fellow classmates used water balloons and super soakers and teachers got in on the fun too...kids can't have fun anymore without getting killed these days...so sad😞😢
Imagine going to jail for life over this 🤦‍♂️
Now kids can’t even have fun in a park, what is this world coming to?? You’re almost afraid to send your children anywhere these days. So ignorant!
Simply a idiot thug trying to keep a tough guy image instead of going along with something fun ...sick of my people killing each other
This comment section full of grown people is so disheartening 😣
Didn't they know it was a WATER gun fight, not real guns
Probably got water on his car and got butthurt
Dropped firearm, accidental discharge, someone hit in the foot. Then deadly gunfire. My God. This scene is a responsible gun owners nightmare.
Problem is the killer will be free before the victim would've graduated college.
That cop is so dumb, safe park he said. whats this story about again ? oh ya .. a murder
We took Columbus down 4  what
i guess its good he turned himself in..
Ok high schoolers playing but bums who dropped out or too old to go to school WHO DONT WORK attack and kill school kids 🤔
Lol almost 200k subs on YouTube but can't get 1080p
BLM!!!
how.
BLM WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?
almost 10 kids/teens have died this week
Typical Democrats
THIS is why blacks have more altercations with police.
Non lethal torture only way to rehabilitate this behavior.
Wow kids can't even be kids no more. What a dam shame
They forgot to mention when the BLM protest is kicking off!
"DEVIL BLESS AMERICA".
Where is BLM?  A Fucking joke!
shocking....u put thugs together and then violence breaks out. Any parent that lets their kids go to that high school should be ashamed of themselves jonesboro and most of clayton county are dangerous places to be now.
Doesn't make sense
I see one variable in the video.
Them Gangsters didn't what them to have fun I'd love to kick hiss ass😡😠
No Daddys
He looks like youre typical jail house goof
America is so fucked. Who is there right mind wants to visit a place where youre chances of dying by some moron with a gun are higher then you could imagine
Where’s BLM? 🙃
No fun can be had by Innocents anymore. 2 many people wit chips on their ass.
Poor parenting
just more turf wars. "it's their culture"
That park had bad news written all over it from the start most folks knew it
Yungins your life is not a GTA game. Stop throwing it away for NONETHING!!!. Nobody will remember how "gansta" you are and most will forget you exist once youre behind them bars, quit playing yall its not funny anymore😔😪👎.
I'm sure blm will be there to help out in the community.
Wow....you can’t even play for fun ...
1:40 Dr. Phil in the house

Always that one Pu$$y kid with a gun.
Weak as dude
The KKK is laughing their balls off
Come on Atlanta we gotta do better bro wtf 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
This had nothing to do with the water gun fight.
This takes school rivalry to a whole new level
“Students & former students involved”. Time to defund that High School.
It's so sad kid's can't have fun anymore. Water balloons and water guns are so much fun. We have to do better parent's. The baby's just wanted to have fun then some knuckleheads had to ruin it. 😠😠😠😠
I remember when high school was a bonding experience to create life long friendships. Where alumni were helpful and would come speak to show you the pathway to success.
I swear theres always that one dude that takes watergun fights to the extreme. And I just finished watching lou ratchetts video of water guns
always the same
smdh😡😡😡😡😡
''... we're gonna have leadership in the county to look at improving the safety of the park.'' BUT STILL everybody has a gun and can shoot whoever they choose. Some safety...
His parents are going to feel so proud now.
When y’all have kids, please teach them not to be ignorant and make stupid choices, these kids take life for granted now a days.
Puxxy
Haha, they show the shooter and he's off the ground with both feet jumping while shooting, someone Photoshop this man a basketball 🏀.
Over a water fight??....the world today!!
Damn they were having fun and those dudes had to ruin it
Basketball Americans at it again
Need to go after the parents as well there not teaching there kids right from wrong
Hmmmm Biden’s world
Hmmmmm Biden’s world
So wholesome these kids.. just like going to church on Sundays
Stupid as punks with guns
How do these slow mind individuals become sheriff's!!!!!!!! Skin color
Scum low income balvks
They just keepin it real.
Jealousy is as cruel as the grave 💔
Kids can't even have fun
BLM don’t care about this
segregation would make the park safer
Typical tribal behaviour
thats a lot of fatherless people
Another weak coward with a gun!
Just young people having fun. Good boy's.
1 Break up the families with welfare, psuedo-feminism, mass incarceration, dumping drugs and guns on the streets, etc. 2 Use media to perpetuate the narrative that these people are inherently bad, incapable of redemption, and deserving of any consequences they meet. 3 Initiate discussions that result in incessant bickering without addressing the root of the entire problem.  4 Rinse & Repeat
*Water* *Gun* *Fight* *In* *The* *Hood* ( *GONE* *WRONG* !!!) ( *POLICE* *WAS* *CALLED* !!)
Hmmm.... figures
Typical suspects
America is fucked
Can we please bring back segregation? I’m so tired of this ride.
Wow good job preventing this one BLM!
Breaks my heart
last water gun fight i had ended with my brother punching me
wow Freemason police logo the all seeing eye bs
"Basketball players" I think they prefer african american
So sick of these kids and these damn guns🤬
The usual suspects...
Sad
These fake thugs kill a man for hitting you with a water gun.
Dude was mad he wasn’t invited
Funny
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven
Ok. Why?
Dude a pos
Peaceful joggers
Dumbass tuff guys do something different we already had gangsters and thugs were the success stories where the leaders at.
My condolences to the family.  What a shame.
This is crazy, I can't believe it! 🤯
At Clayton County high school, being investigated by the Fayette County Sheriff? And yes, I know the other guy is in jail.
i be running about with water guns everywhere and i’ve still not got shot.
Sad. Stupid. Why? Wtf? Really? God😞
I remember when different high schools used to rap beef or dance beef now it’s this times changed
These so called thugs or crooks get their ego hurt so badly and immediately turn rage and don't want their so called friends to think they have any emotion. Its sad that just because these people hang with their crook of friends they wouldn't want to be deemed emotional or have feelings
obviously it was a right wing terrorist activity .....
“Oh sorry I brought my G17 I forgot”
Typical
People like the shooter are a cancer to our community. We should seriously start to rid the community of these willie lynch evil eye devils.
Those ballers were haters just looking for trouble.
You now the killer wasn't graduating 🤔
You know what kind of communities this type of thing doesn't happen in?
Shawn Allen is the type of guy in GTA 5 to ruin your fun by exploding you with an Oppressor
Man when’s America gonna shake back and realize gang life is killing our country all gangs need to be deemed terrorist groups and eradicated cause gang do nothing but destroy everything around them and force everyone around to join or die
the new America
Single mother handy work
ANIMALS!!!!! but hold up America wants police reform!! What a joke man I’m so disgusted with Biden and all these stupid liberals an dems tht actually think the police are the problem in this country. Man they should have just sent them all back on them dirty ass ships a long time ago.
Everyone knows that a water gun is a gateway gun to the real thing.
What is this world coming to ? SMFH
Really over water
There will be no jimmies or water balloons where he's going.  It's all raw.😂😂
Yes America you have the right to bear arms. Wake up.
Ladies and gentlemen this incident is brought to you by 'murica 🇺🇲
Over Water Like For Real You Murdered A Kid Over Water So Sad RIP To That Young Man.
ANTHONY(TONY)BENTON OF THE BENTON GROUP - SAD SAD SAD
Just 2 words : *DESTRUCTIVE* vs *CONSTRUCTIVE* !!!
The gunman pretty much said “I’m done with freedom. Time to go to jail “ I just don’t get the mentality of ppl.
Aqua Lives Matter.
Another savage who could not control his emotions and resorted to violence
Aren't these gun free zones? How were these future doctors and engineers able to purchase firearms? Must be all those maga people funneling weapons into the county.
Coward kills a high school senior. Death penalty!!!
Who go’s from playing ball to a shoot out? Jeeeeez, 😳🤷
So this is it folks eh....this is where we are as a society,ending lives over a little bit of water yet will walk out in the rain no problem...i hate the people on this earth,what an embarrassing time to be alive
I’ll never understand stories like these! You’re watching people have fun and be carefree and just can’t allow them to live in bliss. Big 20 year old *** shouldn’t have been there anyways. Him and his follower should all be jailed. Those not caught are probably bragging on shooting at teens with water guns & balloons bc that’s how stupid some of them are. RIP to the victim. And prayers to all the other seniors having to enter adulthood with this day on their conscious.
How is this not major news? Wow
Shirts off already. Lol ain't u looking to cool down?
Never Relax
More tribal ignorance.
The shooter will have an awesome soap collection in his jail cell soon :) They boys can't wait to greet him.
Bunch of Aholes!
Was that really a good idea to go wetting up peoples cars? It would be no big deal to me but you know how some people are. They could have played in a field or something. If the ones playing basketball drove over there.  I could see them complaining about the teens playing around their cars and some words said and there u go ignorance gets started. Just  folks have fun until you know who shows up. Humans are doomed. The end of humans must be near. This stuff is getting ridiculous.
How come so many people like shooting guns for no reason but cant cook a sidekick properly ?  Like wtf happened to hucking hands ?  Oh wait, nobody wants to fist fight anymore because it gets filmed most of the time.
Shameful
NOAH GET THE BOAT!!!
And this why I only do things with close friends or family✌🏽
Smfh! Not surprised!
When you bring a water gun to a gun fight?
Two lives lost over NONSENSE
Never bring a water gun to a real gun fight.
All these cops are racist . They were just peacefully protesting
Kids should be kids. What happened to that????
Wow smh stupid
Wow these guys can't take a joke.. Also, that news reporter is a sweet one
This is so heartbreaking, just Whyyyyyyy???
Why did the whole basketball team have guns?  Our youth going out bad and it's sad they need guns to protect themselves instead of us being their protectors as we should as parents as adults as leaders. Where all dese guns coming from anyway and how are these kids getting them?
These young cats are idiots
Death Penalty.  We need it everywhere.
Water gun not guns didn’t he get the memo 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Hope he rots in prison
That is a dirty shame! Just can't even have any fun now a days without some idiot pulling out a gun and shooting somebody. SMDH!
It's time to load the ships for a return trip.
This is what happens when you do not ban assault water guns.
Dam I low life’s can’t control yourselves
Kids having fun then an idiot appears and destroys everything smh... RIH to that baby
Why would they even go over there just keep playing basketball wtf ☠️ pointless asf
Just let him have their guns and kill each other off that's what we do just like the dinosaurs
The killer probably started the whole thing.
Can't even have fun these days smh
They grown bum asses should not even been that close to a high school
Glad I don't live in the USA
i hope this man will never get free and i mean with never if he shooting at kids playing with watergun just messed up.
A snap shot that shows the suspect allegedly firing the fatal shot. Allegedly, well ok then.
Wow
That’s ridiculous
The shooting had nothing to do with the water gun fight.. my god can we stop with extreme angles ..
The crime scene photos... brought to you by  Toys R Us
"Former high school students?"  That takes in a lot of the public, I think.  Anyway, I can see from the video that things were out of hand already.  If these are children making all this mess, where are their parents?  Someone needs to clean up after them.  If they are adults, this is totally inappropriate behavior, and they should have been ticketed or arrested.  If they are public school students, why are they not in school or studying?
Sometimes a water fight would escalate to water balloons but all in fun!! It's hot and the water is cool 😎
Ridiculous
The dead high schooler will no longer terrorize our parks with his supersoaker! The shooter acted in self defense,he feared for his safety and the safety of others. Confusion reigned as the shooter grabbed another person's gun,thinking it was a taser and shot the wild high schooler. Suspend the shooter 3 days without pay.
Just SAD AND STUPID
This kid's parole officer isn't even born yet...wasted life..😔
Never bring a squirt gun to a gunfight😂
Don Lemon reports whites shoot at park... CNN special report it was not whites it was a water gun fight here's Don Lemon to bring us up to date..
Kids today are punks!
This will continue as long as being disrespected is a capital offense in these cultures. They also can turn about anything into disrespect, you stepped on my shoe, you looked at my girl............   Raise your kids right become the change. If you want your children to live a full life it starts with you as a parent. Also parents of good kids must inform their children of people like this, with this mentality. They come in every race, religion, gender and wealth class. Inform your kids what to avoid!
We need to teach our kids to be men and fight, sportsmanship, win or lose there is always tomorrow. One irrational impulse leads to a life of consequence.
Water fights usually escalate to a bucket full of water, not guns
Parenting... The More You Know🌈⭐
When I see that they are arresting people that went through an already broken at the whitevhouse as they call for more violence.. This makes me laugh.
Idiots
if you didn't want to be apart of the water fight, why you up there spoiling the other ppl fun?
America now is home of the killers...
What if emotional control was taught in school. What if de-escalation was taught in school. What if we focus more on a child’s mental and emotional well-being rather than what grades they are receiving.
America needs stricter punishments, the crimes or murder or driving with a suspended license are punished the same way, with jail, literally the only difference between the two punishments is the amount of time the criminal serves, and because of this people are not afraid of consequences. In centuries past theft was punished with fingers or hands removed, rape or sexual crimes were punished with castration and severed noses, murder and treasonous criminals were hung or decapitated and their heads were put on spikes and displayed in public areas for all to see what consequences are in store for those who break the law, nowadays young people are arrested for stealing or driving without a license and released after just an overnight stay so they no longer fear jail, no one reals fears being put in time out with your own room toilet and food provided and you can also order foods and find anything in jail... Who fears that?? We need to be shown examples that put the fear of God into us, without God we are lawless, in elementary school there needs to be structure too, when I was a child our principal was a former WWII soldier, he enforced rules, we had to walk on the right in 2 neat rows and stop at every doorway until directed by teacher to proceed, at lunch if we got to loud they'd blow a whistle if they had to blow it again it was a silent lunch and if you were caught talking you were sent to the wall, the wall was a specific wall in front of the cafeteria whrrt those sent had to stand facing it until there class was called to line up for there teacher arrived, this was in the 90s at Camden Ave. Elementary now known as Harry kazarian elementary, he was a WWII vet who delivered mail in the trenches, a friend of Dr. Greenstein our principal, but honestly this structure helped put a sense of respect for the law and a need for structure, most of my peers grew up to be successful in life for being inner city kids with me, being poor doesn't mean you have to be a stereotype of a person who is loud disrespectful ghetto lazy good for nothing thugs who are good for nothing or druggys, we need to instill pride to all and the knowledge we can be examples to others of what one can achieve no matter what the circumstance or where you came from.
Where is BLM?
#BLM
How  ignorant is this from having fun to losing a innocent life. My deepest condolences to family and friends. Smh
That life didn't matter , no?
What’s wrong with the world and certain communities in America. It’s time to actually address these issues and stop making excuses fir your thug children. This poor beautiful young man is now dead and will never get to realize his 1 and only precious life. So sad. Get it together people
1) but he's a good boy 2) that still photo should be shown at trial, every appeal and parole board hearing 3) death penalty case without a doubt
Anyone surprised?
BLM VS BLM
What sort of high schoolers have water gun fights? Only in America do kids that age behave like elementary school children. Why is that? In other countries kids that age go out and drink and do adult stuff, because they actually want to grow up.
Guy: did you wet my Jordans?!
What happened to a good ol street fight? These kids are COWARDS. We used to duke it out, then be friends the next day. Whoever lost knew where they stood,  no words we just knew... 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
BLM 🤣🤣🤣
Guns again
What a great group from the best "community" in the nation.
Isn't that Cleo from 'Set It Off?😝
He should be getting life in prison
So because he's dumb and shot himself, he killed a kid? Hope he rots in prison. He ain't gonna do well in there 😂😂😂
idiotic
"Why can't we just all get along!"
What the hells going on with these kids parents. Mfers in highschool getting into shoot outs.
Our people need to do better
Please start back whooping your kids. And being the biggest influence in their lives. Sad this happen 😢
U no wen its ignorant sad wen yall cant get along during a water fight dam where is yall upbringing manners at oh yall been lost and disrespected that.
Would you look at that.. it's that race, again.
Just let them kill each other until they rid themselves. Much safer streets in the end.
We need squirt gun control.
These punk kids now days have ego's way to big.. everybody wants to look like a super thug and be labeled a so called "killa".. when I was young.. yeah guns got involved.. but not over a petty ass fight.. we knuckled up win loose or draw.... even the way u see these goofies shoot on camera.. it's like their posing for a photo shoot instead of aiming at a target..dude in this snap shot looked like he was balarina dancing on his damn tippy toes
They shota bunch of unarmed students just tryin to have fun and be young people.  Only a cruel, evil desolate soul could commit such a senseless murder.
Where are the marches, protests, riots?  Oh...BL don't really M?
This story had nothing to do with water guns.
This is in Florida right?
Another what-less fool.
Coward he's cute to smh
Where are these high school kids getting these guns. Start charging the parents aswelll.
Man this makes me sad
LeBron James: Kids can't even have water gun fights anymore!
Wait did I miss something? I thought they said one guy had a gun. And I swore I heard them say shots exchanged? Not to be sarcastic but how can you say shots exchanged when one group had water guns.
Justice for Daquan! BLM!
More statistics that people will say, doesn't count.
terrible so sad
I was surprised when I saw his mugshot.   You don’t hear too many stories like this.
my 1st thought: HOW??
This is why cops needs to show up like this!!!!
Squirt squirt boom boom really!!?!?
Should say "guns drawn by thugs".. Not "guns drawn by basketball players"..  This school is a great example for after education studies.. Don't stop the thirst for knowledge; Even after graduation.....!
It’s nerf or nothing
Start charging these clowns as adults throw away the key. Worthless to society now.
Lol. Dequan...
Don't bring a squirtgun to gunfight
No way didn't see that coming
Anchor is beautiful Omggg
Raise your kids right people!
This is what i call "ENRICHMENT" performed by the highly advanced Pleiadian race. 🤔
That boy gay😠
Joggers, are anyone surprised?
Stop paying people to have children out of wedlock would be an excellent starting point but that goes against the leftist narrative. Sorry folks......keep voting, "D".... Keep getting POPPED!
Damn cant even have “Fun” anymore.
This is messed up - bunch of kids playing around with water guns, and then MR A HOLE shows up.😡
Download the Waze app to tracking traffic and police
Evolution and natural selection is still very prevalent in the human race. Honestly surprised how some of these guys don't simply forget how to breathe sometimes. Can we not waste taxes on this guy? Just toss him in iso, turn the light off and don't open the door till he stops moving. Save the money for people worth rehabilitating or use it for school programs to help kids avoid acting like this later in life.
The world would be a better place if we just nuked neighborhoods like this
So many people play with water gun and nobody dies but only in certain American neighborhoods
No I think he forgot his water gun or he mixed it up             I’m just trying to make a joke now get off of my ass
By reading the title I am thinking that the water guns turned into actual guns
Why bring a gun to a water gun fight?
So he got mad OVER sum water
Basketball players, I'm gonna use that one.
We would grab a water holes not a gun 🤨🤨.
"The Boondocks" has a term for this.
This is sad
Come on fam. We can’t even have a water gun fight without killing someone. Shameful. But the next week you’ll be screaming BLM
BAN GUN
Wow 🤩 can’t even enjoy this nice weather without having fun 🤩 or worrying about being killed!
they had the ENTIRE PARK the play squirt guns but they just had to do it around the vehicles and thats what pist off the dudes play ball which honestly I'd be mad too if people were using my Car as a defense shield and having no RESPECT for any Damages they caused
They think they cool walking up on them like that, like let them have fun why did you have to do that.
So we calling gang members “students” now?
Bad boys What u gonna do when the cops come for you ?
What punk his perants should be changed for raising a punk ...so he is at a school where kids was planning with water guns and yeah him and the next kid get in an argument , and why not fight him hand to hand. Mister punk had to pull a gun and shoot the kid... everyone that was with the shooter needs to be charged too
A red flag for me is a group of people  walking together.    Just avoid them.
Education thats the key but parents dont have the right to educate their kids  because  people see it as bad and there are the  counsecuenses  generations of people with no respect  even for the law
Alot more to this then water guns. It's not about the water guns ppl smh. Somethin was brewing well b4 this awful deed took place. RIP to the young man and hopefully true justice is served one way or another
Here's how you stop most of the killings.  Deport every bla person who gets caught with a gun.
So where BLM?
Loser!
Wow.
Several lives changed for the worse all because a few punks had to show how tough they think they are!
Sad
I would skip going to that park since it certainly doesn't take people safety into consideration. None of the Dems would condemn the violent behavior of this community or this race.
Sad man  Kids having a end of the year water gun fight getting shot? I don’t even know what to say those end of the year water gun balloon fights were such good memories. The comments are true these kids are not raised right!
Dude you're a super fool while you're in prison the other people will be enjoying their lives 🤣
it feels pre meditated because u showed up to a planned water gun fight with an actual gun.
He deserves Life in jail
single parents, no dads, welfare and so on and on and on and on....it's been going on since the 1960's... blame them no one else
what do you expect from these folks ??? same crap day after day after day after day.
Boy dats a fukn stupid ass way to throw your life away, trying to be tough. RIP to the high Schooler who was just trying to enjoy life. SMH
Where is BLM?.......OH, they are in California living it up off all those donations.
A new  life  in prison  a  booty bandit fresh  meat 🍖
Real guns fight are much more fun I guess!
In this place and area, blacks and hand guns don't to to gather, its crazy, why, it don't need to happen, where do they get the guns ? that needs to be looked into and the cops with there buddy's, need to do some thing about it, like now, not 20 years from now, get some training, do your jobs, it is not that hard.
Aging losers have nothing better to do other than starting fights with highschool kids then bring real guns to their water gun fight to feel "tough"..
Lol
sad
Ohhh Nooo, Not DaQuan!!!!  You Bastard!!!
Small brain
This is so sad...I can't believe he did that. Was it a setup? Or he just got mad all of a sudden. These used to be fun times
Sad!!
Highschool basketball players with gun's.... I guess they're shooting more than basket's.
Wow wtf. We did this same thing as high school seniors...it was a tradition. Unfortunately I could not partake in the fun because I was pregnant. Idk if the school would have let me or not but I decided on my own not to.
And everyone wonder why they banned the super soaker .
Defund the Police they say! More will continue to die thanks to BLM!
well glad natural selection is doing its thing
that was clearly an assault water gun. need to ban super soakers
Got mad he had to take a shower!
Make the park safe? This is more complex Sheriff.
SMH….
When you’re too scared to fight what do you do shoot. What a loser
When he turned himself in he had the receipt for the shirt they got wet and ruined. If they know whats good for them they better get it exchanged and get my man a new shirt! The Promise Keeper is one boy that does not play!!! Eeeeeewwwwwhhhweeee
It was soo funny cuz said he didn't want his new shirt to get wet. Then he got tested and took care of the situation. They don't call him the promise keeper for no reason. Good on him! Shirt was nice as hell.
When  the shooting is one sided it's not a battle.
I guess someone sprayed water on the wrong Nikes.
I guess the guy didn't get the memo
All these killings have one common denominator..hmmm. so what's being done? Are we gonna ban squirt guns now 😁
Can't fight so he grabbed a gun what a loser.
As an alumni/former student you should only be around to give back or mentor the current students. Alumni events and homecoming is the only time I went back to my highschool. Let the current students enjoy their time there and find a purpose somewhere else.
looks like hes making that pose from the this is america rap video lol
Was the idiot mad because no one invited him to the damn water gun fight??
All for nothing don't get mad at them for staying in school and GETTING AND EDUCATION fuckn coward's all of the ones that walked over to them need to be charged with murder I make sure whatever jail he in someone's book gone be kept paid up bout mine
Damn!! As many of you have said.....Raise your kids as best as you can!!  This is while cops will not let us gather without harassing us!!! This is why we get profiled!! Then you add in the racism and the other BS, we dont have chance.....This is how the people that are trying to do right get grouped in with the knock heads!! These young dudes always  want respect but dont give it.  But when they get in trouble, the system will totally disrespect them!!! The dude that shot other dude in this story, lets see how long his friends stick by him!!!
I can’t with the US population anymore. I can’t watch any of these damn shooting videos anymore. So glad I’m leaving soon.
Guns + stupid brain = 100% death.
Worst part is this community will NEVER STEP UP to figure out why they are viewed in a negative way. No leadership present to represent themselves and talk about why it's happening from this segment of the population. Can't go to Chuck E Cheese, Amusement Park or any place of gathering of that community without getting shot. WTH. Total BS and excuses from " representative organizations" of that community on why they act that way.
Kids this is where ego road leads to, smdh.
Snowflake gets hit by water droplet --- feelings hurt, so he shoots them..  "He dissa'spek'tit me"
Man y’all kids don’t know how to live y’all lives and have fun anymore ... someone always has to pull out a gun and ruin everything. This is devastating
When your ego is such a big bubble that you don’t realize that’s your last time walking free for decades.
he has a gun so he gets to walk all tuff with no shirt fallowed by his goons
What is the dead guys name?
Y'all need to start raising those......... not just bread them!!!!!!!
It is just so sad that you can't have a friendly water gun fight without it turning to a real one and then someone gets killed over it, this is such a wicked generation now
All them dudes from the basketball court was pussies...
How's that multiculturalism working out for you, America?
one common denominator...
Please please start locking up the parents of these ignorant kids. People have children and expect the streets to raise them. If you can’t raise your kids, every crime they commit, you should get the same punishment. Y’all all need to be in jail. You can’t even teach your kids conflict resolution, pure stupidity!!! I’m sick of it.....
How’s that Defund The Police working out 🤷🏾‍♂️
I commend those who are trying to make a difference. Each one reach one. For those who simply criticise and complain,  I have no comment.
Blm ?
That’s how you no ppl don’t wash 🧽 there ass it’s water my dude it’s good for you
Former students, grown ass men still hangin around their old highschool. Get a life.
That's a shame you can't even have a water fight without somebody dying
More douche bag, Democratic thugs not knowing how to act right in public. But he was a nice boy...
Jfk what is wrong with people these days
Damn shame my people. We talk so much about others killing us but we ourselves do the most damage understatement I suppose but you get my drift I’m sure of that! #compassion
A fight never stays as a fight.... Gunfire will most likely come afterwards
Guns don’t kill people, people kill people with guns, why are these youth packing heat? Hmmmm so these students all have pistol permits ???? Smh just such total disregard for human life ......
Bro could jus been mad about them hitting they cars they made it seem gang related 🤣🤣
Former students....   Why ain't y'all off in college or working?  Oh, cause that ain't cool.  Kill somebody that looks like you for clout tho! Apparently, that's cool...   Pitiful
maybe gang related
Typical
The rest of the group who were with him should be charged with accessory to murder, especially the one who did not resist giving his gun to the man who shot.
Lol Blm
Scum bags
These criminals are getting younger and younger and more violent pretty soon we will have to make an electric high chair.
Only in Atlanta
Glad they caught them please stop killing each other BLM
niggas could’ve just fought but wait fighting ain’t a thing no more I’ll rather get jumped than shot bro 😒 rest up kid and to who ever knew him 🙏🏽
This is the same thing that killed bugz from Eminems rap group D12. He hit someone with a watergun and he got shot for it
Shii sad tbh i hate niggas tht act hard wit a gun
BLM .... LoL
It's not about the leadership any longer.  They failed.  Their failure is the trash running around being the problem and results of
Damn, news lady fine as hell lol.
I bet they were wetting one of their cars...... they should have had the water gun fight in the grass not around peoples cars.
This is people not raising their children. Start holding the parents responsible and I bet they spend the time necessary to raise these bastards.
Wth kids can't even have harmless fun because folks got mental issues smh!
Damn can't even let your inner kid out and have a water fight. People are evil
When groups  get bigger time to leave.
Everyone knows waterguns are the gateway to real guns.  This incident proves it.
my my
This is fucking terrible
It the fact the he trying to look all hard but look stupid bc now he in jail for shooting dummy....stop the violence🔫❌
Way to go Shawn 👍
Where's blm?
Want to be a gangster but end up being a hooligan taking this kids life two families are ruined now and for what stupidity this my block this is my parking lot dude its 2021 get civilized.
First let me say this woman in red is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.... But didn't we just get over the BLM thing.
where is BLM ??
For no damn reason. Sht sad and got to stop.
Reporter hiding in the woods
I’m Doug Evans, hiding in the woods.
You take a life "unjustly" you forfeit your life... It's just that simple
BLM peaceful water fight.
The typical "I'm really scared to shoot" pose. The typical ”I'm gonna start the fight, but if you win, I'm gonna shoot you" type of person. I hope he gets life in jail.
Someone’s a sore loser
Why isn't BLM rioting over this?
I have a feeling both sides play dirty with gang background else they wouldn’t have confronted eachother
Morons
GOD. THIS IS SOO SAD.
People of color cant even enjoy a day in the park without killing eachother it was probably over looking at them wrong
BURN LOOT MURDER!!!!
Llllllllllllllll
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Take down my comment again commi tube
I'll post as fast as you take down
B.O.B crimes  :/
This is what I'm talking about completely pathetic
it's always "teens" doing this...funny cause i rarely see asian american "teens" do such things
This is why we need to totally defund the police.
BLM!?✊🏻
Lawd, not again Lawd. Bless these water gunners, lawd
In Chicago Noone can own a gun legally
Crank makes you cranky
Wow! What a POS! Such a wasted life. Lock him up & throw away the key!! RIP to the young man😞
o snap girls in the parking lot... time to be bout that life
Lesson: Don't go in to a gun fight with a water gun
So sad 😞
Pitiful
Just killed someone AND ended his own life. Fool.
what led up to the violence ? A "kind and compassionate" culture led up to it.
His body language spoke trouble from the time he walked up
wow kids having fun led to one dead over words, just words!!
Give that Clown 25 yrs show off.
at least the poeple told it some cases alot of caess dont no body tell it
damn
6 Words. Read carefully. NOAH and the Ark get aboard.
So quick to pick up a gun. Wow. 😭🥺 Satan steals, kills, and destroys. Lord help us. 💔
Why can't African American youths comport themselves in a way that doesn't portray them as violent thugs. Conflict resolution as well as de-escalation should be taught at an early age.
Losers
Not surprised
Let the dead bury the dead...
And gone do life bro waisted his time shootin at them .
Where's BLM? I guess they don't care if police aren't involved.
Were there any protest? Is LeBron tired of this? People don't raise men any more. They raise punks that want to shoot someone if they look at them wrong.
wheres BLM ?🤔
what
Trifling
Where is BLM !?
I see a trend here...
Our youth continues to die senselessly put the guns down
Restless cowards!
Brought a water gun to a gunfight..
Everyday occurrence if you want to defund the police .... Can you imagine that people really do want to defund the police . unbelievable.
Waaaaa my pp so small I have to shoot someone who sprayed me with wawa... what chicken
I bet you one of the girls got wet and complained to her boyfriend
Blamers having fun
When I was in school and ppl had fun we joined in, if there was a fight it was 1 on 1  and no weapons were even used . God I seriously hate this generation. Kid never even got to enjoy life as an adult
Mayor Murder..
OMG. THE TEENS WERE HAVING FUN. UNTIL ONE BAD APPLE COMES INVOLVE WITH HIS MESS. IT IS SAD THAT OUR PEOPLE HAD NOT WOKE UP TO REALITY OF STOP KILLING ONE ANOTHER.
Time to educate Shawn to don't be droppin dat soap behind bars
The fact they were just trying to have fun ... 😥
Kids can't have no type of fun
Wow
This is my childhood friend son who got murdered 😢
Dumb ass 2 lives lost smh
Cowards!!!!
Just another day in the neighborhood for some...haa✊🏿
"allegedly"
You mean to tell me the gun free zone signs didn’t stop someone from bringing a gun there? Feinstein said if you tell them then they will disarm themselves, so did the kid say that?
I was just there 2 weeks ago
Improving the safety of the public AKA having police every single place that you can go SMH. Regular people who just want to go to the park with their girl walk the dog and smoke a little weed can't do that without these fools fucking it up
So I guess throwing your life away is the new wave now.
Bruh
I like how it's "Allegedly" even though he is seen on video with the gun in his hand LOL Also, so sad that people can't even have fun with water guns without having to worry about being shot.
The best way to celebrate the end of high school is to avoid these “water fights” , “water bucket 🪣 fights”, dunking others in the 🏊🏽, etc. Most of the time the “innocent fun” quickly escalates into violence. Prepare yourself  to receive your diploma at the ceremony ifo family, give hugs to classmates , prepare to move on to college or other endeavors to build your life for yourself. My heart 💜 😔 pours out to that young man’s family for their loss. I hope the animal that killed him is convicted quickly & administered the death penalty 💉☠️.
When people make the likes of George Floyd a hero, what do you expect?
us and guns....
How’s that defund the police thing working out ATL? Maybe focus on these societal issues and violent crime?
Lol...  Look at us.  We are losers.  I believe it now.
Damn thats crazy!
BLM DONT  fucking matter here does it.
This is sad all around. You always have to ask yourself though in situations like this. Where were the parents at? How did they raise them to become like this. I know sometimes environments around can sometimes influence our bad nature. I grew up in the hood, so I get it but still where wtf were the parents at?
I am gonna say it. They have a segment of our people who are just fucking evil. This individual the way he walked up was the bully want to be a boss. But is about to get toss up and salad racked inside tbd big house. Maybe impersonating as a man out here amongst children his age play land. But make no mistake about it. He is in for a hole lot of shouting while getting himself CROUCHING WHILE DIFFERENT WICKER INDIVIDUALS PENETRATE HIS SUBSTANCE. It’s the way it goes in the big house. Hundreds of child rapers waiting fool risk takers
Sad 😢
All those present with suspect need to be charged as well..
Who raised these kids ... wtf
R.I.P young man! This is really fucked up! My condolences to his family! Praying for both families!
He had to prove his blackness
Is there a reason why a bunch of dudes who just got done playing ball all had guns on them.
You guys are making it sound like a watergun fight escalated into a real one, which apparently is not what happened. The shooter had nothing to do with the watergun fight, which was already going on when he and his group approached..
Hope he gets life without parole
Lock all them up.
Now that's a darn shame when you can't even play with water. Without having a stupid shoot out. Wow  !
Some people HATE life , they throw what GOD gave them right in the trash. Prayers go out to all trying to stay strong.
from what I heard ,they filled some guns up with urine,but in other news 42 shot 7 dead in shicago. lol.
I hate when they say alleged he’s on camera he shot the kid
If it was more peaceful them young men would not even need a weapon people with money do not want to move where it's not peaceful
They must be putting estrogen in the water something
Smh dont play with trash or this will happen
These parents need to do better!! Control your kids
It's atlanta. Doesn't surprise me at all. If you've ever been to Atlanta then you know they'll run you off the road if you even attempt to pass.
They brought the gun, therefore they had intended to use it.  Would be nice if people would stop looking for fights just as an excuse to use a firearm.
So sad 😞
A bunch of former students should have been at work. The current students were having fun playing with water guns and water balloons. Sympathy to the family of this young man.
The Wild West is here in our streets. Help the parents to pray for their children, they belong to us too. Our future!
Dead souls everywhere. How can a kid decide to just kill someone over nothing. What a disgraceful human.
It's all that damned ol systemic racism keeping these brothers killing themselves haha I'm starting to think soon they will be killing each other at higher rates than they can breed which will be a relief for the entire country hahahajaa
This is what happens when boys are raised by their mothers, they run around pretending to be men but as soon as something doesn't go their way they turn into little sensitive bitches and shoot people.
mans had fresh tns tho
How do u bring a real gun to a water gun fight? #SadSmh
This is our problem young COWARDS  who make us all look bad.
Was it a pool party
Parking Lot For Parking.     Where Is Parking Lot Security ? ? ?
Yo
Where's blm?
So stupid smh
Kids need some God damn discipline, what are high school kids doing walking around with handguns?  Raise your damn kids right
When water turns into lead......☠️☠️☠️
I keep it on me to but dam I wish fighting would come back in style.
This couldn't have happened, I didn't see it on CNN or MSNBC 🤷‍♂️
It's always more to the story
Diversity is our strength.
Stupid
If only there was some way to identify the kinds of people who do this. Some defining feature or trait....
children nowadays fight breaks out gun fire breaks out someone dies
children don't want water guns they want nine mm hand guns you can't kill someone with a water gun where is the fun in that
These lame ass people can’t even have a water gun fight without killing each other!
Thug life
I miss back in the days where we would fight before picking up the gun.
This is horrible
Guess who..
They're gonna shoot something at his face in jail.. and it ain't water.
BLM ......SILENT!
What dumb people
I’m confused so does BLM only matters when a police kills one of us?
But there won't be a golden casket, or a eulogy from Al Sharpton, or a gigantic mural for the victim, because the perp wasn't a cop.
So sad. Praying for the family
no father figures in sight
TRASH TAKING OUT THE TRASH NO ONE TO BLAME BUT THEMSELVES.
0:34 He isn't no murder suspect he is the murder
Imagine having 0 self control
He walking like he hard wit all them ppl behind him😂🤚🏼stop. And so what the cars were getting wet..when it rains it get wet , when you wash it it gets wet.. what’s the big deal?  R.I.P. ain’t have nun else to do but go fw sumbody
Where's Obama's big mouth on this????
Smh these young people throwing their lives away. Back in the day you got in a fist fight no guns were pulled out you lived you went home.
Well ladies and gentlemen
Wheres BLM at on this one? 👀👀👀👀👀
Imagine that.
Cause one group wanted to be more gangsta? Over teens having fun safely? You have to be a real loser, low life, miserable person.
CNN headline: “Kids having a fun water gun fight, until trump supporters brought real guns!!!
Bury the scum ass  basketball players!
Sad
BL don’t M when they killing each other does it ? What a joke
Kids cant even play anymore.
Always has to be some dumbass to mess up the fun. What a b1+ch!
Stupid
SAME AS USUAL
Hmm
Dont bring a water gun to a gun fight.
Trash.....
This makes me so angry like why are you bothering high school students having fun
How senseless! These thugs out there with guns destroying families and for what reason?! Just disgusting
So sad uncalled for my prayers are with the fam🙏🙏😥😥💛💜
Still don’t make any sense to kill that young man!!
This is truly sad and sickening.
What!?! What’s wrong with people?! Obviously a water gun, why shoot someone. 💔 They were playing innocently but some thugs had to come over and end a life? 😢 so heartbreaking!
A parking lot isn’t the place to be playing.
Kids now a days don't know how to control their emotions without having a physical reaction .. So sad!!
Lmfao
*HOW?* What was the point of that...
Wtf water to a real gun
It's ok they are good kids. Go ahead and defund the police.
Shawn is stupid 😂
Where are these clowns when it comes to Zimmerman,  Dylan roof etc.... PATHETIC!
This thug bully bullsh!T has gotta stop. The parents have to stop raising these street monsters. Those kids playing water battle would be safe at home, if it wasn't for that waste of good welfare.
Can't have fun no more
This is so sad! The afternoon turned from kids meeting up to have innocent fun with water balloons and water guns ..... to a parent making funeral arrangements. Sad!
BlM men!
Got dam nughs
Yup, that seems about right. But hes a good, honest, clean kid. He mistaken his gun for a water gun. Honest mistake
That’s crazy, fun time turned into sad times
Wakanda forever we wuz kangz and sheit  🍉
Always the jocks
Kids these days really can’t go and have fun anymore without some degenerate trying to shoot and kill ppl for no reason.
This is sad.
Don't use other people's property as a playground.
I only like this video cause the fine ass anchorwoman
Wow, one bad apple spoils the whole barrel..These kids were having fun until some Billy bada$$e$, decided to turn it into a murder scene.
Waiting on LeBrons tweet...
Heavily censored comment section. Can't go against the "opressed" narrative
2:42 That’s a woman’s hairstyle. Undoubtedly raised in single parent home.
Sc firing squad should reach that far with no worries I'd reckon,, man up little g Georgia boys... U at recess still, catch up,,, dungeon fam... U all G
Only a coward cant take. A lickin.  And arrogance require escalating. To drawing a weapon. It is our collective shame that.     Childish mischief turn deadly.
We were all having a good time with out water pistols, the next minute homie got mad and said main im tired of kids having a good time main.........
What about the other victims of the water gun fight who got senselessly soaked?
Pure 🗑
Man he gangsta my role model right there -sarcasm for the idiots
Won’t even get a chance to speak to me if you even try to walk up like that 🦂 R.I.P this is sad
Ignorant
Sad part is some judge will give this killer probation and he will kill again it’s not guns that kill people it the systems fault not locking them up for life
This boy had bad intentions until mothers doent start raising there children properly this will never change I hope that boy stays in jail for the rest of his life.
Dont care how you look at it
KEEP KILLING EACH OTHER......THINNING THE HERD ONE MORON AT A TIME
I hate to say it but they need to bring back the electric chair fools will stop killing for no reason then ,& If not at least taxes will go down for housing these fools
I constantly see a common denominator when it comes to crime these days.
The wicked shall be judged.
Stupid is as stupid does
Defund the police!!!! Good luck America
2 lives gone🤦🏾‍♂️
Color says it all, nothing new
Lol, always the same folks involved
Can't teach it in school, if being a good person isn't taught in the home its likely not going to happen.
Need to make a law, death for death, you don't get prison if you kill someone just cus you wanted to.
Imagine living in a place where you can't even enjoy a water gun fight with your friends.
Plot well plan see full story on my page https://youtube.com/channel/UCcHe3uXgqcdijIRNIdpQPnw
This is so sad 😢 and seem like he had it out for that young man. 😠
Sin and a shame
Only thing going to start helping any situation in the United States as far as all the violent crime and murder bring back the death penalty you dumb asses
Cheap deregulated guns and dumb crazy people thats america
Trouble attracts trouble. I'm just saying.
This is absolutely sad.... What in all the fawk do we as blk and brown ppl have against each other that we have to be CONSISTENT with taking each other's life... I am greatly saddened by all this straight bs coming from a mom of 4 sons and 2 daughters who is all grown and has their own sons and daughters........ Raise ur F_$##& kids teach them right and wrong... This all starts at home ppl... we continue to allow the streets to raise our kids this will always be our outcome..... Not saying his parents didn't do their best... it starts at home is all I can say 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm tired of people saying that this needs to stop or people need to change yall dont say that shii till yall watch a video or somebody in yuh family or close friend gets killed/hurt really bad
Sad
Prison time for life or death row bro. Was this worth it?
My heart is with this family just sad disgusting and vile and senseless I just lost my brother March 28 to gun violence the pain is unbearable this is so heartbreaking my heart goes out too the family innocent life gone so so soon my deepest condolences to the family of the victim💔💔💔💔
Im blown away by the stupidity of these morons.  I’m gangster yo, bang bang, bang bang.
This is so horrific.... You aren't safe anywhere anymore. Little kids getting killed at McDonald's, in their front yards, now in the parking lot of a school during a water gun fight... We have to do better.
It wasn't because of the watering obviously..its was just wrong place at wrong time..media always puts a spin on it
What a big brat. That huge water gun fight looked so fun and then he comes up and ruins everything.
Why they think they’re tough with a gun😂 and thinking they’re cool with a gun😂
100% pure stupidity...
You don’t bring guns to play basketball people love aye people having a good time without them
The guy who pulled a real gun on the victim should be charged as an adult!! Give him the death penalty! They really do need to bring the death penalty back! My condolences to the person who have lost their life by the hands of the perpetrator .
woke yet ? fools...
Teens and groups like that prefer jail than free life.... there's always gangsters
Only in America...
Some kids are so messed up in the head can’t even trust nobody out here , when you going to the corner store it might be your last day even if you have a gun permit you still gone end up hurt most likely.
They were fighting over the last Popeyes chicken sandwich.
Never take a squirt gun to a gun fight.
HOT SUMMER COMIN
THIS IS SO VERY,VERY UNNECESSARY AND SO SAD
Goofy Ass Mopho.....He must have lost the basketball game so decided to shoot out with water gun fight made sense to him.
Who gets violent at a water gun fight?
#BLM ??... Clearly not anymore..🤷
Aw, BoweL Movement BLM had a peaceful picnic. How nice.
If you automatically thought of a certain race even though you were right ...you have rword thoughts. If you foresaw something bad before it happened just because of who was at the park and took your kids out of danger, that's the rword
Gotta learn when the people you're hanging around with are idiots and stay away. I only associate with people who are trying to further their lives in a positive light. Why would I want to hang around people that are going to our me or my family in danger? That doesn't even make sense.
Did he thought that these guys were planning to do an armed robbery with Supersoakers at a Baby Gap store?
Unbelievable
Dang...cant have no fun without somebody ruining it for everyone.
BLM!!!
What a moron don’t these people know there are cameras all over. He’s going to be locked up the rest of his life cause he wanted to look badass.
Good he stayed on the street longer to feel his last days! Now coward its time to be judged 😂😂😂
Make it safe by putting these model 'students' in prison instead of forming worthless committees.
Heart breaking
Wow can't even have fun anymore
I’ve only scanned these comments, and a whole lotta folks are calling straight up for prison sentences, life, some may even be thinking death penalty...... HOWEVER........ while I am thoroughly disgusted on MANY levels....... should we not FIRST (in the interest of fairness) discuss his mental condition and seek, as a first option, to get him help?  I mean over the past several years, this seems to be how these situations are addressed ........... IF............. Well, just sayin.
Hahahahaha
But why though!!! We MUST do better! This is a result of institutional ignorance.  A system that hinders our history so that our youth do not understand what is already stacked against them, and therefore have no comprehension of how damaging this is BEYOND the incident!
Just can’t have fun anymore. This is so wrong.  A life taken for what cause u was mad. Now what⁉️
Such a shame.  Pretty boy like Shawn Allen will now be irrigated in prison with tons of super soakers - up his azz.
He needs an example made of him! I'm so angry our kids should be safe at the parks. 🙏🙏🙏 to the family of victims
Strange how they are able to get a hold of handguns so easily without a job.  It all starts at home.
Trash
those boys are goofie smh now there going to be locked up with booty bandits 🤦‍♂️
I hate the media and their bullsh*t narrative. It’s deeper than just a water fight. There some bad blood/conflict between the two groups. I don’t condone it but it’s something that went down between them before and it got settled right then and there.
I see no color🤡
Dude they were trying to have real fun wtf
So sad.
LMAO clearly police are the problem....
Yeah but hes a sweet innocent boy who never did anyone wrong!! Lmao yeah right
If the parents were more into they kids and teaching what to do and not to do and not use guns etc..etc..pretty much guns are bad period parents needs to be more into there kids life and talk too them more
Wow so 😥 these kids now a days do to much rip
This got dam shitz got to stop
That was planned
Title very misleading. Conflict was between high school water gun fighters and adults that approached them. This station's journalistic standard is lower than most youtubers.
How heartbreaking
Prayers for the families 🙏🏾🙏🏾💔🕊💔😱😢 How do you go from having fun, to doing such a senseless act of crime. God bless us all... #StayWoke🤎🖤
Fellas are loving People grounded in decency Don't LeBron me
do people not look at human lives at something precious anymore? ain’t no coming back. rest easy. 💞
One got wasted, and the other's a waste!  See this every morning on fox 5. Welcome to the ATL!
i hope hes trown under the system... theres no need for him to be running in the streets
Guess he was jealous because they didn't invite his crew to the water gun game 🤦🏾‍♂️
Dumb and senseless
Thank you deputies for charging that 20 year old man! I love you guys so much! You deserve 1 million dollars!
Don't even send the cops. Defund the police remember. Let them figure it out.
There’s more to the story. Sounds like some beef to me.
When you raised by a woman with women emotions this is what happens.
Good thing he rotting In jail now
Comment section make u forget what u just watched.....yall crazy
I thought a water gun suddenly start firing live rounds.
Name your kid "Dequan" ... and his fate is sealed
So ignorant
Spread the truth, document it , PROVE IT , make it irrefutable. That You too will become DANGEROUS TO THOSE WHO ADMIRE US IN LIES AND ENSLAVE US IN SOCIALISM !!!!!!!! But because they are lying, its possible to expose them.. This is thier obsolete deal. But by comparison..we have nothing to hide, we have no reason to lie. And we wouldn't want to...even if we could. Truth is a far superior weapon than deceit. Its a weapon which is denied to them. And in the end it will be the decisive weapon, that destroys them completely.
People just wanted to have fun. Now a teen with his life ahead of him is dead. Is that what we want?
Ninjas
Why hasn't BLM said something about the horror of this?
These comments are a reflection of what America is today.. Racist and cowardly because most of them won't admit it when confronted face to face. lol sad and pathetic group of people.
That's pretty thuggish.
Didn't happen when kids had their guns in school and cleaned and practiced as a class. I wouldn't let my kids go to school now. If I had any I'd move into the woods and forget society.
Can't even have fun anymore in ATL. Schools are brain factories.
This is tragic & unbelievable!!! How does that dude rationalize bringing a gun to a group of kids having fun with water guns & water balloons? That’s the least tough guy ish anyone can do to look to harm harmless people. If he wanted problems he should of looked for a large group like his that was in the same mindset but he’s too much of a coward to confront those types of people
What are y'all exaggerating about? Looks like a normal day in America.
Small brain losers...
What would LeBron do?
This never happens in my neighborhood. Well I am from a different neighborhood. Probably the people I'm my neighborhood fault.
Bye bye Sean or Shawn (however you spell this demons name). Off to where you belong you go little buddy. You dont belong around regular people just trying to live their lives and have fun. You'll have plenty of time to think about how bad you messed up. R.I.P. to the young man who lost his life for no damn reason. smh
streets got it messed up thinking you a real man if you play with guns and shoot ppl... i grew up when you had to throw hands to get respect....cant have a man to man anymore... beat someone ass and they come back and try and kill you... sad days
Typical, did he really think he would get away with this ? 25 witnesses that all knew his name.  BLM needs to come say his name.
So we marching or riding for that young man folks?
Blm! Blm! Blm! Oh wait.
Typically!!! WHERE IS BLM????
This young man kill a high school kid over fun.Both life changes in second. High school die and the thug has a lifetime sentence
Well where the hell is BLM right there just seems like pretty senseless violence a little more senseless than criminals not complying when the police encounter them
USA is sick.
over water. dam.
I always told everyone basketball causes violence makes people wanna shoot
Entendi tudo 👍 kkkkkkkk
This young man kill a high school kid over fun.Both life changes in second. High school die and the thug has a lifetime sentence
He be's a good boy.  He be's going to college!
All fun and games until bro decides to keep it real!
Strange how people are not taught common sense,........ if you murder some one  you go to prison......
Sad.
We need to change our system, anyone who murders or hurts someone, gets the exact same done to them.
Where's BLM now?
water gun guys: hey you are too old to be here real gun guys: ima show you I can act like a child
what a f***ing cheater!!!
It’s so sad that young high schoolers can’t even enjoy clean fun without this kind of thing.
I don't blame my daughter for being a loner I always tell her at her age I had lots a friends n socializing....but these teenagers now a different breed
Can't go to the park?  Prosecute him and three or four more.  Innocent fun destroyed?smdh. SICKENING made me cry.
Another case of failed parenting.  You killed a dude over nothing? he didn’t value his life or the person he killed. Sad.
Not my son ,my sons a goodboy! Mic drop
What a generation of cowards 😒
Make an example of this violence, we need to start executing more violent criminals.
What in the actual hell?
I hope all people like this get life
This guy is a scumbag. This is learned behavior. These people need to get it together.
Repent and get right with god before it’s too late
....so you're doing 25 to life for a water gun fight.....mmmkay
What a douchebag. Kids just having fun and the douchebag gang just have to ruin it....sad. RIP dude.
🤦🏿‍♂️🙄😑😲🤨OMG SMH REALLY JUST WOW he wasn't  raised  right at all good he's in jail make sure he rots there someone  going to merk him in jail..
My condolences to that young teen 🙏
It's all good he will be out soon. System doesn't work on people when it's supposed to. Only works when innocent people are wrongfully convicted
Kids becoming more and more wild.  parent's too lazy to  parent so sad.
BLM lmfao
Drug kids. Start arresting the parents.
This is just sad news.  People can not walk out of the front door without feeling threatened.  What is wrong with our country?
For pete's sake has anyone looked under his mammy's bed yet? Or, drivin his Ho's car. Or gone to "visit" gramma in (wherever).  Or....what the hell.....back on da courts.
Dat Blacc culture.
BLM ✊🏿
why are these kids being allowed to carry guns,
Look at the roving pack  mentality . No where is safe unless your tooled up and alert
OOH OOH I know how to make the park safer!
Why do people hop when they shoot
BLM?
Sue police dept.and the school .they allowed this to happen watching in canara close circuit video and from somewhere and doing nothing but encouraging crime & violence .
#BanAllGangs and you dont have water gun fights in parking lots around 50000 dollar cars you never paid for but get to drive
God we stupid
Wtf lock his ass uo forever
Where’s the diversity? Why does this group call together a water gun session without much more diversity? Are they raciss?
Whoever he was hanging around should also be locked up because they were invoking it and didn't try to stop it so they need to be locked up also if you were with him you go down with him
where’s the protest?
Wheres Obama talking bout this could've been his son?
BLM?
O frsho give him life thy was having fun
I feel horrible for the kid that died and his family.  I'm glad that the shooter is off the streets, one less thug the community has to deal with.
Prayers and love to the young man murdered and his family💕💞Who raises these demon spawns?..Good Lord have mercy..why?? Why would he do that?? Them kids were just having fun and this dumdum had to come along..smh.. wowzrz..true tragedy😥
Wasn't he proud of what he did? Wonder why he didn't smile to his mom on that mug shot?
LOCK HIM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY!!!! WE NEED MORE JAILS FOR THESE DEMONS!!!!!
He had a bad day. Before that day he never did nothin' to nobody.
This will never change til the communities root this trash out. A bunch of kids having fun the real future of a community snuffed out by   the thugs. But I'm sure we will blame another group for why this happened
I've said it a million times, some people just have an IQ so low that they cannot conform to society. Here is one, the man was just too dumb to be a part of a good society.
Where is blm ? Riots?
13/52, again ...
So many stupid people on this earth.
stop playing with these thugs they want to play stupid games lets start giving stupid sentences. bring back death sentences
Can't even have fun without somebody wanting to kill you
I cannot believe how many shootings lately have been like this and no a single peep from that movement that's supposed to care........zero outrage??
That don’t make no damn sense!
Lawd..That long hair... they all have that long hair going to prison (straight bottoms)..or to the grave .. funbois🤫🤔
Ha i’m SURPRISED!!
A fucking shame!!!! I remember the days where my cousins, myself and my neighbor's would play outside in the parking lot of our local sports plex with water  balloons and water guns and chase each other around!! WE ARE ALL ALIVE TO REMINISCE ABOUT IT!!! Why can these kids nowadays just value life as it comes.
As if the majority of them are high school graduates LOL!
He’s in Georgia. Hell DEFINITELY get life. He’ll do about 50 years. Georgia don’t play. He can pray all he wants and get in the prayer circle. You going down buddy.
Im so sad kids killing ...
It always have to be one.
"I keeps it real!" - Dave Chappelle
god have mercy on shawn allen.
A lot of accomplices.
Please start giving them life sentences and death penalty let’s make examples out of these ruthless evil hearted young people who have no respect for life that idiot was just a coward ignorance at its finest
democrats took the Ten Commandments out of school, like thou shall not kill and thou shall not steal is some sort of demonic religious cult instead of common sense.
Stupid asf
Guns are supposed to be for self defense, not to protect your ego
this is what happens when you are raised to be a complaining feminine victim. of the world..  No doubt doesn't have a father in his life.  such a feminine piece of garbage.. WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY?????
I remember in the 90's we had high school water fights. Girls ran to avoid getting their hair wet. Dudes ran to avoid getting their clothes wet. It was all in good fun. You got caught you got caught. Then they turn around picking up all kinds of container that can hold water. Just to get back at the other person. We all went home safely
BLM
Senseless 😥
Shut the park down that trash won’t go away
You can tell when the basketball punks showed up they were up to no good.
Dude with the gun probably was tryna play the “tough bully “game  he just wanted to ruin the fun cause he felt like he can if u from the hood u run into alot of those type of dudes
Killer must’ve been a cop.
Having fun? Yeah... they’re  “having fun”.. This is not the time to play with fake guns. #facts
Biden-Harris to take immediate action by banning assault squirt guns and water balloon projectiles. Biden said, there is no need for water guns of war to be in the hands of our youth. Harris was shocked none of the shooters were wearing triple masks and many were within 6 feet of one another.
This is a damn shame. Did not one of the 2nd set of guys say "hey Sean, it ain't worth it man." And the person who handed Sean his own gun should also face charges.
Another reason why I will NEVER step foot in atlanta
You squirted me in the face jayshawn!!!
Water pistols end up in real pistol use.
Where’s BLM thou 🤷🏻‍♂️
Nothing but cowardly punks nowadays. What ever happened to simple fist fighting?
Too much cowards in this country weak mentally weak
Only punks that can’t fight with their hands use guns!  That 22 year old shouldn’t had been allowed on school property!! Such a shame!! RIP!! 😪
I have a solution to this problem  due to the facts if we can catch these kids young enough we can put a stop to this  the mother and the fathers of each kid that's involved in shooting  start placing the mother and the father in prison for the crime  this way they see they have a valid child they will report it at the age of six  and the justice department could get therapy  and what  and what is necessary  to prevent further damage
Where's the outrage where's the riots?  Crickets
These kids now have extremely high egos they'll shoot you for anything.
No hanging no peace
Why am I not surprised
This is sad we killing each other of bs
The world is crazy
That’s a grown man that murdered a child. Not a water gun fight gone wrong
BLM ✊🏿
It seems some don't play well , with others .
Where's blm?
22 year old former student ??
Wow ya all cant even mellow out long enough to have a water fight?? Why doesn't BLM say anything about stuff like this? These are are kids playing with water guns how does that escalated to a kid getting shot and killed.
Nonblacks killing blacks will never overshadow what we do to each other on a daily basis BLM will not speak on this. My life doesn’t matter until I get killed by someone who doesn’t look like me BS.
I hope he rot in jail
BLM !!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Lol, Tough Guy turns self in to Cop's.   That's hilarious 😆🤣😂...
Sad 😞
Stupid ass.really? You can’t have fun in the park? You can’t communicate and just have fun? Sorry lil salamander...
There are clearly no parents anymore
What a tough guy
That news anchor tho
LAME ASS DUDE 🤦🏾‍♂️ TOO SCARED TO FIGHT!!!!
Stupid
Only in DA HOOD!!!
When there are 3 you will never see me.
Just the names identify shooters!!  Any more than 2 in a group I is going to die!!
Proper response from the sheriffs department-shinning example for other law enforcement departments nationwide.
If only there were a vaccine to give you self control.....when mom and dad dont bother to teach you
The 15% will do 75% this year.....
Anger control?
Damn... this is so 😥Sad 😥
They like jail they like sleeping with men and being locked up so lets say screw that put everyone in isolation cells only time you can talk is during chow everything elts no more human contact that should be your punishment some of them we need to put in one and let them just die i can understand some things but this kind of thing you deserve isolation and death no more humans no more family for you
Same people different day
Dude bought a lead gun to a water gun fight.  Sad 😔
He still fucking with high schoolers 🤦‍♂️
Stupid people doing stupid things
Too many stupid jack asses out here....reinstate the death penalty. They don't want to be here anyway....they just afraid to do it themselves.
Dude must of been an opp 😬😬
Can't even have fun no more... Dam man it's just water guys relax. Now one young man is gone n another is gone forever n for what???
That's fucking crazy
These young guys try to be so tuff and act so hard why
Where are all the BLM protestors??? Where's Lebron James, Maxine Waters, Colin Capernic, Nancy Pelosi, AOC and Crissy Tiegan?
Tutu's vs Hutu's.
Idiots Turned a great fun afternoon into a life changing tragedy. Sheesh 😒
That's what happens when you have a bunch of pitbulls running around
Meanwhile, while he's making himself at home in prison:  Inmate/cellmate: so Shawn, what you doing life for?  Shawn: well, was having a water gun fight & this dude wet me.....& I'm allergic to water, so I did something I'll regret for the rest of my life.
Lock them all up.
We had guys out of school going to teen clubs and middle schools beating people up. Nothings changed.
They really can’t help themselves.
“He disrespected me” will be the “excuse” the killer uses.
Raising a bunch of punks.    However i always feel like where are these guns coming from hmmmm.....there nothing being done to stop supply chain of illegal weapons
More of that "melanin of love".lmao
Wow
BLM
Damn.... smh
There’s one thing we can always count on with YouTube and that is negative comments ‼️🙄
Man should get life in prison. Such bs kids have a water balloon and squirt gun fight. They walked up looking for problems over water balloons
BLM tho right
The protected class strikes again. 💩
You can’t go anywhere where there’s too many N-words!🤦🏾‍♂️
2nd group was listening to 2021 SH_TTY rap music right before...................
My oldest son is 13 and at the age of wanting to go out on his own to the school park to skateboard and play basketball with his friends and cousins. I go with him and my sister meets us there with  my 13 yr old nephew. This is exactly why because kids now days can't have a good time on a sunny day without some dumb ass doing something stupid!
IT won't end tell they are dead.
These parents should be ashamed because you failed your kids
FOR REAL kid's can't have gun ANYMORE
I'm tired of this mess.
Those people man
Throw away the key, once they’re locked up❤️✊🏾
I'm gald he went to jail they have firing squad now for death sentence
Typical High School reunion in Atlanta..... LOVE IT!!
Wakanda
How the heck he got reak gun!? For me he's still a kid! He shouldn't be able to get real weapon!
Dumbest low pant thug if you see person with low pant mean danger mean have gun to kill anybody
BLM rioting over this yet?
BLM.
so sen-less.  utter stupidly.  why the f would you shoot some and no less initiate confrontation.  what in the world could justify this in this person brain.  Have  fun  in prison which should be for the rest of your life considering how stupid they are.
Its a shame kids can't have clean fun without a damn fool showing up everytime to ruin the day.Sad Times😔
trump fault
Over half these punks end up being someone's wife in prison when they don't have a gun to hide behind. In prison you easily can see who the really badasses are from the wannabes.
Poor high school senior kid must have accidently got this grown thug Jordan's wet by mistake
Bwackkkkkk Bwackkkkkk  Strikes Again!
The only people that turn something fun & innocent into something DEADLY. Something wrong with their mind. Demons possessed.
Ridiculous !!!
I wish all the weapons we have are water guns including police.... .WISHFUL THINKING.  WOULD BE NICE THO
Tnb around joggers never relax.
Georgia, what gives?
*you dont bring a water gun to a gun fight.*
He must of been all sadd his mama didn't buy him a water gunn!!!🤢🤢🤮🤮💩💩💩
only  oneway  to  make  it  safe,  when  they  see  they  asses  pull  up....run  they .asses  off
Such a nice neighborhood too.  🙄 Shrug.....
Give his bad ass 30 years plus
People are so meager and weak nowadays.  I don't know a single person who still had such a fragile ego and delicate sensibilities by that age, and I know my fair share of shitheads!
I’m just glad NOBODY got hurt
This is why blacks should have to register their water guns
It starts with a couple of small mold spores...then it turns into a deadly fungus. This same thing is happening across the country! Meanwhile drugs, criminals, sex offenders are pouring in across the boarder! Guess covid ain't a problem now. Welcome to Bobblehead Bidens America y'all. Sickening, huh??
It’s sad that people can’t see other having fun !!
Fry his a**! I'm sick of people like them. Poor baby was just out enjoying what we would call senior day and these stupid individuals had to come over and disturb them with the bs. They just should have stayed on the court and played ball.
What a loser that brings a real gun to a water gun fight!!! Must be the same type of guy that throws the video game controller when loses! What a low life
The fact he even had a gun on him at the basketball court says alot
Can't change a lifestyle
This is America
Guaranteed to be the least shocking thing in the news today.
Preying on innnocent children! He will be somebody's bitch in prison.
As long as gangster rap that glorifies gun violence is allowed by law to be made,sold,and listened to,that park will never be safe. It would take many years of none of that lifestyle music being allowed to be heard before any decline in shootings would be noticed.
BLM in action.
nobody cares
It’s not the first time this asshead shot a person. At this point this in his life he looks to show this skill off because he enjoys it. Don’t drop the soap!
Blm
That gets him “props”
what happen to fighting kids dont fight anymore. more cowards are being brought in the world and the good ones live us so early
🤣😂🤣
Just proves hiring on more cops is not the answer to reduce crime.
Nobody knows until they show the video..'what actually happened'.🛂🐑🐏
Stupid dumb people don't know how to be responsible with a firearm...jus bcuz you own a firearm doesn't mean you go ruin lives..
✊🏿 ✊🏿
What color?  Oh....
And not one BLM protest will be seen so it continues.
2021 and my 80k camera phone still better than the video
"DeFunD tHe PoLiCe" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Can't even have fun without getting shot in the U.S
WHAT?? OMG.
we cant have fun things anymore....this country is broken...
BLM don't matter in this case
Absolutely american
USA!USA!USA!
What the hell! These kids go out to have a good old fashion water balloons and squirt gun battle and these punks have to come over from their basketball game, start a war of words, then get physical and then pull out guns and now a young man who was just out having a fun time with his friends has been shot and killed. What is wrong with you people who started this crap with these kids? Why did you do this? Did you think before you acted? This young man has passed and now his mothers, father, sister, brother, family has lost him. All because you would not let children be children and have a good time. You owe his family, his friends and all those children an apology. Hopefully next time you will keep your ass on the basketball court instead of interfering and causing harm when there never should have been any. You All Caused His Death, You Might Not Have Pulled The Trigger But None The Less You Participated By Joining In And Disrupting Their Fun. Shame On You All Shame On You!!! Pray and Pray Hard for Forgiveness and Start making better decisions from now on.
And this is why I don't go to the US. You are always at risk of getting shoot. What a savage country
Death or life without parole, should never be aloud to see the light of day
Life is full of problems to solve one with a gun is a stupid choice.In this case .
What? Video proof of b***k on b***k gun violence?
BLM
This Breaks my Heart
Y’all made it seem like it was over a water gun it was obviously a altercation before shooting
https://youtu.be/a1NY6MW2RUs rest in peace
20 years from now when he's trying to get parole by saying he was young and made a mistake. I hope the judge says to bad you should of had a water gun instead of a real one
#HelpSomebodyOldSchoolSoulfood
Why hasn’t anyone done anything about gun violence.
Then they say why this generation doesn’t get off their phone and go out to play.
It was water gun fight only.
The dude probably thought he was O-dog just cause he brought a gun to a water gunfight. What a coward.
Right to bare arms
Nothing new here this happens to them all the time it's in their culture.
I blame it on guns
Now he’s gonna be a bitch in prison. Hope it was worth it buddy ;)
This is honestly sad because imagining the innocence of their water fight being disrupted by some jerks
wouldnt have happened if it was Joe and Frank arguing. Its only with Dequan, Shakirs, Immanuels of this world.
We are in a Spiritual Battle Folks. . . " Good v. Evil " and "Right v. Wrong”!!  TEACH YOUR KIDS THAT!!!
Usa should ban gun to public
The government approve the use of gun and they get the price out of it
*BLM*
You just know they're gonna blame it on the guns.
Stupid culture will bring stupid incident which will cause stupid and the normal people's lives
I'm so damn sick of people with fucking guns. People can't fight anymore. They have to settle with guns. Learn how to damn fight. I swear you can't do anything fun anymore. Fucking sad.
God I hate it when people 3rd party, shits just not a pro gamer move
Good thing we didn’t defend the police yet
Why is no one taking about the leaked video https://youtu.be/jSyE_TFNtOU
Do they have the death penalty in GA? Asking for a friend...
Guns don't make you a man, dude was all over his feeling. I hope the judge give him life
Always the same culture
So sad , why do people keep doing this .
why would you kill someone for having a water fight, prayers to his family
That's like a Nerf fight gone wrong
They should change the Title I thought this was gonna be a funny video
Another member of a certain ‘culture’ acting as predicted. I swear this has to be a genetic defect among certain people.
Atlanta...im not surprised
typical of these types
If he had a job he wouldn’t have been there to shoot someone, instead of dreaming of Labronica’s nba , bobc
allegedly.. with video evidence.
Weakness.
The news lady was just on the news hurr in St. Louis
Mama boys with guns
SMH IS THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE KNOW IS VIOLENCE...GOD!!
The equivalence of "I thought it was a taser" smh
Everybody wanna B gangstas
No big surprise given the color of the perpetrator.
Pieces of trash ruining good fun. Throw the key away on that one. Damn shame
Whyyyyyyyy?
13. 50. The culture must change.
I actually live very close to there, been to that park many times.

If it bleeds it leads
Imagine rolling up on some teenagers with water guns 10 deep, all grown men btw, and flexing to your boys that you got one but not with your own piece cause you were already scared and dropped yours.
Im sorry what??
Why they using water guns? That's not gonna fill a quota.
WHATS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE NO REGARD FOR LIFE SMFH #BANRAPMUSIC
Just #000000 on #000000, nothing to see here, move along folks.
So that’s why I’m not allowed to bring water guns to the pool...
Ban water guns
People are ***** nuts.
N...
Killers should get killed. They chose this way. If u don't, other Will keep killing 🙄
Meanwhile at BLM : 🦗........
Then some say "the Capital punishment is too harsh!!" He literally took a LIFE of an innocent person, so Y are u sparing his???
Pride is destroying this country.
Playing basketball while carrying a    gun. FUTURE N B A !
Bro that sad u cant go have some  fun with something happen
When you wanna be hard for no reason..and end up in jail
THIS WAS SENSELESS AND HIS NEED TO BE IN PRISON DOING LIFE FOR A LIFE!!!!
BLM where you at? This doesn’t matter or fit your narrative?
No report on BLM having a giant "protest?
It's time to get these dangerous assault weapons off our streets! We need to ban water guns! How many more people have to get soaked before we do something!?
Only in ninjaville
Lol nothing is good when a shirtless sagging pant guy shows up. All fun and games and that guy appears. And you wonder why no one likes them
😢😢😢
The problem isn't the gun .. its people being so sensitive...
Why do people always have to come and ruin the fun?!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16
Tough guy... Let him be tough while he rots in jail the rest of his life
stop playin wit people 💯 everybody ain't childish
When watergun fight gets real..
Bet he feels real tough. Let's see how tough he remains in prison.
Groups huh? Turf war?  Uninterested, non engaging community?  Things will only get worse so start practicing your suprised look now.
As long as you let people have guns. These horrible stuff is gonna happen. How many more people have to die until you realize guns should get banned? #BANGUNS
Hope he gets life in jail. Also my thoughts and prayers to the family of that kid. He's in peace now ❤️
I'll wait to hear from Lebron.
These Same people will run through the streets screaming BLM .
what a fucking bum .... waste of life and disappointment and heart break to the family's
Back when I was in school you didn't pull a dam gun on someone and still don't fight it like a real man kids today are to quick to pull out a gun
https://youtu.be/BcL0nx8YEis
Is it me or is the female reporter smiling?
It’s disappointing that people have to make this about race. It’s just about some thing sad that happened.
Smh...I'm all for the 2nd amendment but I'm thinking some people need to be banned from having guns. Too many innocent people are dying! Classes need to be taken and vetting needs to be done before anyone can own a gun. If you're caught with a gun without the proper training and vetting, it should be considered attempted murder or some other serious offense that carries at least a mandatory 5-10 years in prison.
By "former students", I assume that we are not talking about alumni that graduated and went on down to enrich and grow in the path of life.  I'm guessing that we are probably talking about kids who dropped out or were kicked out in the 9th or 10th grade and became criminals.  However, we now refer to them as "former students."
We call these dudes bitch boys. He let his emotions take over. He. was supposed to be enjoying himself and having fun. His emotions got the best of him. Single mothers are raising these types of young men.
Now watch, friggin sjw's will say it was a peaceful shooting..
Allegedly 😂
Guess his like didn't matter.  Where is the outrage and BLM!  😡😡 So sad a young and aspiring life was cut short by some animal!
Anyone thinking what I’m thinking
Any tweets from LeBron James about this?
Anyone thinking what I’m thinking.
This is a case that shows how important education is. Everyone should go to school and study properly.
So tired of Rosemary’s babies!
Why do we allow 20 somethings to hang around a high school playground and not be required to work, go to college or trade school or join the military?  Backward nation. The education system in America is failing everyone. It has been for decades. This is very sad. Prayers out to everyone involved.
Wow ! America is great again!
Courtney Bryant, we miss you in St. Louis
Good
No surprise.
Do we need referees in parks now? People should be able to get along together without gun fire. Especially gunfire that kills. The Pandemic had nothing to do with this incident. Now a young life is gone. I hope guns are worth it.
Bro, wtf
They were just trying to have some fun. ☹️
Sounds premeditated to me
Cowards always comes in numbers, trouble usually comes in pairs
“Taser, TASER”
CNN won't cover this because it doesn't fit the narrative
PEOPLE CANT EVEN HAVE FUN ANYMORE
He want be getting a life sentence did yall hear. He was shot first in the foot then grab a gun from someone then returned fire in GA he would have beat the case because he wasn't armed he had to get the gun from someone else after being shot unless he throw a punch fisrt then got shot in the foot he will do time
More peaceful smart Africans,,,,
Imagine graduating only to get murdered in the end. R.I.P.
What a great culture they have
The victim may have splashed some water on his 1999 Explorer. Come on now, the shooter was protecting his proprty.
🤦‍♂️
Gonna have to replace the water gun emoji now
Haha fool u bout get life for tryna be hard
Same old, same old...
Real real real dumbasses
One more batch of fine and outstanding BLM citizens training the younger ones that fun is not allowed! ...you be a gangsta! Put them in the choke hold...they deserve it!
Who brings a gun to a water pistol fight
Who needs police brutality. They seem to be killing them selves just fine.
Hmmm BLM huh? Smh.. stop killing each other!!!! How stupid? Now multiple families lives have been changed forever.  Senseless.
When will these kids learn that there’s no future in killing each other. Well…2 futures. Life in the Pen or 6 feet under!!
Effing A whole. Put him far, far away. Permanently.
WTF 🤬
They got nothing better to do but kill each other smh
Fatherless homes.
Now where does blm fit in?
Haha
I believe these females fight better than the guys of this generation 🤦🏽‍♂️
Does anyone see the common denominator in all these shootings and killings across the country?
No hard now 😡
BLM ✊
Hmm who’s involved, I guess certain lives don’t matter
fox locals: news & stories fox news: lies & propaganda
🤔These "GOOD MEN" are running amok, robbing and killing by the dozen A-day.😱. This is the result of the catch and release program. They know they're not going to be held accountable for their actions, because the media/courts says that they're victims and good boys.
going to prison cuz someone got water on you.  thats keeping real
How can it "alleged" if there is footage of him killing the highschool student? Isn't that proof?
Woooow. They came and fucked up a wholesome event for nothing
Well, I’m not surprised.
One tribe vs One tribe ( nothing changes with young people)
Why couldn't he use a water gun like everyone else?
Shocked
Damn! Let the kids play. R.I.P Jit.
The new "National Pastime "
Hyenas vs hyenas
Don't judge, it's a cultural thing.
Never let that animal see freedom again.he can be tough in prison
Tribal Mentally, It's never ending .
Where’s the outrage with this?
blm
Welcome to 2021.
Always a bad 🍎 somewhere
I'm sorry but she is gorgeous!
These young punks are useless
This is ridiculous smh give him life in prison and charge the 1's who was with the shooter they instigated it
0:40 he sure don't look like a huwhite man... keep those numbers up boys do a #offeachotherchallenge with other cities like Chicago or baltimore lmao
Here is the new dumbest ignorant fool of the NEW YEAR right there killing someone over a water fight
With these animalistic superpredators it's impossible to have a fair game with all the rules being followed and everybody respecting each other. Just impossible. Sooner or later somebody gets their feelings hurt and the real guns come out. Seen it happen a million times before.
If only the idiots who have protested over the last year focused on trying to stop this sort of senseless violence in their own communities rather than play strawman
I mean it's just like the cops... he probably grabbed the wrong gun by accident... right?
.....anyone shocked?
Even if u dont care about the life of the high school kid....you are to dumb to care about your own.  Now he's dead and you will most likely do 30+ in prison.  People will kill you for absolutely nothing.  Zero.  People are really really dumb.  Remember that when you are trying to use common sense in a situation.  There is a good chance the other guy has none.
Playin too much. Nobody got time for that
What a shock! Their bl@ck
BLM
Bring back death penalty period
People are stupid
J Consition 🏆 🔫 🏀 RIP ⚰️
Stupidity at its finest
Disgusting
I hope he never gets out because he intiated the conflict and than murder the young man. Kids can't even have fun anymore.
Is the murdered teen gonna get a blm riot/protest or no? Sad he was killed for no reason
Madness , JUST MADNESS !!!! BECAUSE OF A WATER PISTOL GAME .
Don’t bring a water gun to a gun fight! ☹️
Just sickening!!!
"yo they got water guns  .... get the strap"..... SOME PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE CHILDREN SHAME ON THIS KID AND THE ONES WHO RAISED HIM
Where is LeBron at????
Only in America 🇺🇸
Well I think he won that fight yeah?
What a surprise!!!
Bro that is f———ed up!!!!! Damn shawty!!!!!! Kids can’t even be kids. He lame asf.
This is why no one takes blm seriously
So sad but BLM right 😣😥
Usual suspects, all look the same these days.
Ridiculous
Sounds like fortnite you trying to have fun and bam a sweaty soccer skin ruins it..🤣🤣 Sorry for the family of the killed studenr😢😢
Obviously America has a Basketball-American problem
Don't ya know ? It's normal to carry guns to basketball or water pistol competitions.
What type of loser brings a gun(s) to a squirter gun 🔫 fight!
All of the people that was with the guy that shot the other high school student need to be charged with some type of crime this is how we end senseless violence
He sentenced that kid to death sooo
It's stupid they have no value for each other's lives exactly why I don't take my children or grandchildren to the park exactly why I stay out of neighborhoods and areas where people are gathered up because it is stupid they b**** and moan about how they're treated try looking at how you treat each other
The only way to make the park safe is to hire full time prison guards on duty 24/7
This is so sad.  😢
Over water… where are these teenagers getting these guns.. RIP young man…
Can't have fun nowadays without a coward messing up things for others
Anyone ever see that movie the usual suspects? It's a good one.
I bet he was such a great kid and his momma is on the news begging for them to say he was 😂😂😂
Blm ✊🏿
WoW just WoW not fair!!! My LiL Cousin '23' was working Security at this party in Downtown LA when all of a sudden a fight broke out so he did his job separated the guys that were fighting, all of a sudden one friend of the Loser started shooting with an AK-47 6 were injured including my cousin  and the most unlucky was my LiL Primo cause he died. 5 months later and the shooter is still free even tho Detectives have his  full name, address, description of his vehicles more than one yes cause he is a drug dealer  have video and audio from the incident and still can't get him. He is African American.  R.I.P FERNANDO LUIS  YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS MISS YOU.
People need to grow the f*** up.
Jealousy, stay your ass on the courts!! SMH! They must have been having too much fun for SATAN!
Savage
Somebody must have had tap water in theirs....lol
Dude ran out of water and decided to use a real gun.
How to make the park safer ? Bring in a bunch of NRA Trumpers with AR-15s. It’s a rat 🐀 and cat 🐈 mouse thing.
It's so over populated in that area seems the oxygen is lacking to the brain nothing but crime, killing, raping in that area of Georgia it's a damn shame.
Can't relax with the .....CATS!!!
Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle, Detroit.   Stay out of these mega murder cities
His dirty ass was probably afraid of water
I hope they put him under the jail for LIFE🤬🤬 kids can’t even be kids anymore! Like why did u feel the need to kill someone???
That’s real poor shooting stance that murderer coward has. Hope he gets turned out real good
Murica...
The anti-gun lobby will want water guns banned now
Stupid
I learned when I was a child of 8 years old, do not play around people's cars,they will go ballistic if you scratch or even touch it...smfh
Stupid
Idiot
Unbelievable
Damn why does everyone have a gun in America?!
2 young lives wasted.
Racism!!!!!
I'm 66 would I be classed as a former student,he's a grown ass man FFS.
Dude was 22 and scared of a high school kid and ran for a gun. Pussies with guns.
He wUz a GoOd KiD ThO
Guys playing basketball with guns in possession? That should have been pretty obvious. A stop and frisk  would have resulted in a huge gun battle with police!
The blacks 😒
Definition of a loser.
In, LA., That's called get off my turf. Sad state of affairs. R. I. P. Young man. From Donald in Valley Village CA 😆 donaldsteffen085@gmail.com
Where's the BLM protests
Blm lml what a jokes
Culture get use to it.
Where is Hollywood... crickets. Nobody addresses the real problems in America when it does not advance their careers.
Just the usual environmental cleansing.  Stay tuned for more to come.
Stupidest
HOW
0:21 Say that 5 times fast
They all look like punks l. Not the British kind either.
And everyone that followed the guy with the gun to the water gun fight all need to be held accountable because no one was bothering them everyone was having a good time throwing water balloons and shooting water guns until they all came over there together so everyone that was with that young man that shot and killed that other boy they all need to go down
Everyone that came to the park with him should be charged with murder
Why did a group of high-schoolers all have firearms in a public park? This is absolutely mind blowing
What a fucken a**hole. I hope he gets it done back to him.
BLM damn it
Why all these young people carrying handguns?
He is dumb. So he is giving up his freedom just coz of an argument. Basically he won't get Laid anymore, won't party, won't ear out anymore Coz he wanted to show who is boss.
So, the kid was upset because he pulled a Plaxico Burress, so he shot someone else? 👎
lets not make this horrible act of manslaughter a reason to bash african american folks, the dude who shot the kid should get penalty or life in prison
All you can say is HOW ?
Where is blm
STUPID FUN???
😢
That should get you some respect in the neighborhood but unfortunately you're not going to be there to enjoy it
Like I keep saying gang gang is taking over Atlanta and by 2024. It will be the new Chicago 🙄🤔. People just think that your having a good time and No One is causing trouble. Then the gang gang comes to your party
Lesson: Don’t bring a water pistol to a gun fight
BLM vs BLM
It is so sad to see fun right down the tubes
Wow really cant even have fun in the hood
Confucius say, don't bring a water pistol to a gunfight.
Why is his grown azz going over messing with those kids having fun. He needs to never see the sun again without a bar in front of it..
NICE! NOT SURPRISED AT ALL! THIS IS SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
What kind of firearm discharges when dropped? Was it a first generation Sig p320?
Where the hell is blm laugh out loud
Where is blm? I’ll tell you where they are not is in the hoods that need help keeping kids in school and out of gangs that’s where they won’t ever be because it’s about money not equal rights because we will never act like animals so we will never be equal!
Suspect looks suspect, as in DL. He purposely shot the kid so he can go prison and live his life out the closet.
Death sentence seems about right !
Keep going-- Some are their own worst enemies-
Death penalty
Don't bring a water gun to a real gunfight...
Arrest the one that gave him the gun also
Give him 50 years and see if he has reformed or not
People need to pay attention to other people body language because clearly from watching the shooter body language I knew it was about to go down 🤦🏾‍♂️
Gee more MALE pattern violence, what a  surprise #NOT
Up until he pulled the trigger, he was considered cool by current cultural norms.
Typical. I'm not surprised.
NRA statement : "ban water guns !"
Keep this bs out of Fayette County
Never underestimate the potential violence of a street basketball player.
He was looking too kill somebody just evil
Smh....why can’t you let people have fun. Just because they are laughing and smiling you want to come and be evil? Smh...
Wakanda Fo' evah !
Will there be a protest and riots and lootings?
God rest his soul and give him Justice 🙏
Nothing will save this country or generation except time... one day people will realize, only after so much death
The usual suspects
Basketball American shoots innocent teen playing with a water gun.
Look Democrat gun haters it's a hand gun.ban them too ?
Typical trash
What else would happen?    Shooting scenes are in popular movies, on tv 24/7/365, in rap, video games, etc.
Dude had to stand his ground. Right??🤔   He feared for his life from a water ballon. I'm 100% positive thats why we have the 2nd amendment..Water ballons can only be stopped with a "good guy" with a gun.😑
What a coward taking an innocent life then running and hiding
blm enough said
Water gun fight that turned deadly? How? Are they called themselves BLM?
Did he really think he can shoot somebody in front of all those people and get away with it?  Some people are so stupid.
So sad, so fuckin sad...
Oh brother. What a bunch of trash.
BLM should be protesting there any minute.  Oh wait nevermind.
when fake lil boys spray real gangstas with a water gun, somebody gone get wet up not with water tho. i would of did the same thing if someone sprayed me with a water gun, catch a 9 mil to tha face lil ass boy we dont play with water guns we play with real guns
Typical violent Trump supporters
Increase the peace please  young people 🙏❤️⚓ so sad
They always get caught and thrown in jail forever 😂😂🖕🖕
He mad because he can’t swim
sounds like if they want to make the park safer, they need to start searching the basketball players, cause they had not one, but two guns...go figure...
There was bad blood between the two groups before anyone entered the park. The only way to keep the park safe is to keep the thugs out of the park.
And as usual NO ONE saw anything, nor did anyone see who the shooter was, or what was said.  And the shooter didn’t read Joe Biden’s law that schools(and parking lots) are Gun Free zones.  Heck the signs are everywhere on the campus and streets surrounding the school.  Maybe the shooter was absent the day language was taught.
these animals should be behind bars
R.I.P
I just love people. Just want to run up and hug every person on the planet. Said no one. EVER.
Killed with his own gun damn
Those teens🤣🤣
LEbron  where u be?
Gun Fights happen daily in Atlanta, and in every City in America. Finally it's being reported so Americans can see -- also, how nothing is being done and it's getting worse by the day. Defunding the Police.....  More Body Bags are needed.
Wtf
Well Sean/Shawn have up his freedom and rights for what?..senseless wicked hateful.
Stop playing with him
BLM y'all, lol
Haha
That’s terrible!  Those kids were having fun and then that happens? What is that boy doing with a gun in school anyway??
I blame today’s rap music
Obviously the best argument as to how much these lives matter..
How the hell does a water gun & balloon fight turn into a murder with a real gun. What a shame.
Kids these days play ROUGH!
Parents should be charged...
Gunman got mad because he is afraid of Water🤡May they throw him in Super max with out Parol!
Kids can't even have fun anymore..
Improving the safety of the park means cops on scene which will only result in the community turning on cops.  This is a DAMNED SHAME.  These young folks were simply enjoying life and getting ready to move forward into adult-hood.  I am infuriated and heartbroken and I don't know any of them.
No one taught them that the things their ancestors did to each other was wrong, so they are still violent tribalists that would sell each other if they could.
Guns   again? i see a pattern here.
I hope they find that punk. Can’t throw his fists so he holds a pistol.
The usual species of offender
Play too much
Wow,  so sad over nothing just people trying to live life, like I said that’s sad
just one dead? disappointing.
So the water gun fight had nothing to do with it... great headline 🙄
Usual victims usual suspects.    Good job Keshia and Stacie   Warnock doing great 🤮🤢🤭.  Idiots.  Typical
Dumb ass! this guy took a life and is about to spend if not probably  the rest of his life in prison.
Systemic racism caused it.....
No comment
That water gun looks busted AF, must have been in the family for YEARS.
The whole group of so called basketball players were looking to make trouble where others were having too much fun.
Murder
Was it worth it?  What an idiot.....
Time to bring out his photo when he was 6 years old....
They should have 🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃
LOL Gunfire wasn't "exchanged' one group was packing water pistols  and water balloons
These ignorant kids make me sick!
I guess their school didn't incorporate Critical Race Theory fast enough to free these boys' mind.
the usual suspects.... why BLM is no where to be found?????? where are the protests??
Typical
Why does the shooter always look the same!!
Where is the Sheriff looking🤣
Reminds me a national geographic .
Some people are destined for one of two things. To either be someone's tool. Or, their own fool.
I hope he enjoys his lifetime in jail ❗
Can't just throw hands any more, a bunch of cowards walking the earth
By the way, has LeBron come by?
We need a Purge.
Imagine getting shot over something that doesn’t stain and dries within minutes 😂😂😂😂
Just joggers doing jogger things.
His life is over
In the end one of the kids that was playing squirted the wrong kid who was not playing. Just bad parenting.
I guess these idiots out here mindset when they get the day started is what can I do to go to prison for the rest of my life. Yes! That's my goal for the day! They get butt hurt for some dumbass reason they want to pump out bullets. Well now you're gonna be pumping and dumping while your cellmate watches you for the rest of your life!
WOW ..... i like just really don't know what to say anymore . I DO NOT KNOW.
Uncle Ben's Rice imagery removed from packaging, Confederate statues taken down, representation in commercials up to at least 80%, and it didn't seem to help at all.  Huh.
The parent should be charged criminal neglect.  Get ten years. The did not give a feces about their kids.
Hey BLM, hello..... BLM? Where are you BLM?
Get these horrible thugs off the street man, this is getting out of hand now 🤬🤬🤬😡
How do you improve stupid people? all it takes is one person to mess fun up
So damn sad
This is sad the kids can't even be kids and just play anymore always some drama 💔🥀
Dang, these kids mess up everything ‼️😩 how water fight turns deadly?? Someone must've didn't wanna get wet‼️😔
*Beyond stupid*
Taking  a life for a water gun wow, this world getting crazier every day
Wtf 🤦🏾‍♂️😳
Intelligence at an all time high. Where are the protests
A coward uses a gun! Wsp. like this right here. Coward!
Don’t drop the soap
SMH  ..... cant even have a water fight ,  this is a sad world .....
It will not get better, it will degenerate from water war to throwing pebbles to then rocks and then homemade bombs pipe type !
Now that wasn't necessary or that serious  everytime something happen they want to grab a gun what for to land your ass in jail really that is what's wrong with the world now somebody looks at you wrong or say something  to you go and get a gun that's showing you are a coward  or a punk you done took somebody son,brother,baby daddy,it don't make no sense  when I was going to school we use our hands to fight we didn't have no guns around  we just would fight and the next day back friends but now this generation all they think about is a gun that's not going to get you nowhere but in jail,prison,or somebody cemetery.
Were all saying he should get life in prison etc but we all know he will be a free man in 5-6 years due to some liberal policy decision to empty the prisons.
Smfh
Most were 'former drop outs'.
Once they are out of school, they have no business over there fighting with children.  Twenty year old men should be moving on to other things.  This situation could have been completely avoided.  I am so sorry for the family.
Stop saying “allegedly” if its on video.
Please stop Killing each other 🥲
What a savage
This cat here,  is going to get some good physical therapy in the very near future.
Now they gonna start banning water guns
And long lives the awful n-word , sad !!
I ain't naming my son daquan no mo they always getting killed bruh  it's sad😪
Weird DumbvDumb
He was a good boy on his way to college in the fall. Now hes going to prison for life, cuz.
They were just out having fun ... damn 😪
This... is what gets things shut down for the youth. I have no empathy for this Allen dude. Give him exactly what he gave another young brother
Wow.  When water gun fights escalated in my neighborhood someone would grab a garden hose.  Times surely have changed.
So, one group of BLM people, were explaining the movement to another BLM group. When the second BLM group didn't understand how peaceful it was, the other BLM group showed them by killing one of them.  I guess I still struggle with how BLM is about peace.
Blm...... Ya right .. tell them...
What led up to the violence ??? Humm let's see....
All the former students need to o be on prison
Where is BLM?
It's the ATL. That's all you need to know.🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️💥💥
Unacceptable
Where’s Lebron James saying about this ?? Where he at
Aww you fucked up my jordans .. bang bang bang bang smh
Coward trying to look brave with a gun shooting a kid with a water gun .
Stop saying allegedly shot. THEY DID SHOOT.
Brothers STOP KILLING each other. Wow. Enough is enough.
Enjoy them 3 meals a day 🤡
Really tough guys.......I think the shooter is a sissy douchebag.  I think the shooter doesn’t know if he’s a woman or a man and is having an internal debate with himself!
life sentence
The love of man will grow cold as wax, I learned that from a carpenter!
Career criminals in the works.
Wonderful!  I wonder why this happens?  Couldn’t be.......
cant even have fun these days
The saggy pants crowd
Atlanta again.  60 years of Democrat run cities sure are paying off.
Meetings will solve everything!
I thought this was an apartment complex...they are all typically home during the day...we work so they don't have to
Lord help us. Racism can end and police shootings can drop to zero. But absolutely nothing will change in our communities until we fix this. We must stop this.
What the hell is wrong with humans.  We are a bunch of fricken animals.  All of us.
Start prosecuting these thugs instead of letting them walk every time they commit a crime. But yes, ban guns from law abiding citizens, that'll work. smh
Right BLMers again and again
Blm
#cancel the rap music and rap culture because it's pushing self genocide that's the bigger problem in America than mistake systemic racism itself genocide it's being pushed by rap culture and Hollywood #cancel rap culture #cancel Hollywood
Young people don't realize they're Just throwing their lives away by being stupid and doing stupid Things. It's Really Sad!  Why did he have a Gun In the first Place... If he was my son I'd whip His, ASS I was saying.
In what world do you go from a water gun fight to real guns and a dead high school student. That’s freaking sad...
Relax at home folks can't chill nowhere peacefully
Clearly the thugs left the area they were to encroach in the other area. Bullies ! Time to quit talking, swapping words about. Time to get tough on crime and send a clear distinct message through the entire United States, that is is not long acceptable. Gun control is not going to stop this ! In Minneapolis now young kids are getting killed in the thug war. Time to stand up accross the Nation.
Gang related
I've heard don't bring a knife to a gun fight but a gun to a water gun fight. Disgusting
Sad sad sad
Good bye Shawn Allen !! Lol big dummy smh
I always take a gun to the basketball court! NOT
Proud Boy.
Punks belong in prison for life!
It’s always because of losers and followers.
Punk ass enjoy spending the next 20+ in the clink.
That idiot does not whole high regard for the little freedom he has.
There's a common thread thru out these senseless murders . Hint : De-funding the Police isn't the answer .
Horrible and sad
See - the operative word here is 'fight'! SMH
life that’s enough evidence
If you wanna fight like a man, use bare hands. Ridiculous how people get easily triggered and grab their guns instead of communicating.
Criminalize violent gang membership. And a gang becomes 'violent' when any one member helps another member commit a violent crime.  Any gang members that don't cooperate with police can join them in jail.  That would be step 1 of fixing this problem that has been sweeping the nation for decades.
Atl smh
I like that! he show what he is in early age. What more he can do if he’s not identified/caught #purebredevil 😷
Anyone wanna guess the reason it turned murderous?!?!
Usual suspects and victims... no one cares
Parks and school shootings should get death penalty
So the police are fine with wannabe gangbangers hanging around with guns at the park untill someone gets shot by one of them?
They're parents must be so proud
Come on!  16 to 22 year olds with hand guns!  Try calling them what they are...criminals!  Those young people trying to have fun didn't deserve to be assaulted with fists and guns.
Some people don’t like to get wet.
He  just mattering.... he was a good boy
I'll take country living over that gang life in the city any day. Generation after generation of trash
B.l.m
Listen, why is it so easy for these kids to get guns?? Sweep the streets and make it harder for them to buy guns. If they try to purchase a gun and don't have a job and under 21, they should have to write an explanation of why they need the gun as a part of the application process. And then they get the gun upon approval of some entity other than the gun shop owner. These murders are senseless 🤦🏽‍♀️
This incident is tragic. Sad that some high school kids can’t have a water balloon and water gun fun. Heck, we were still having that kind of fun in my 20’s.
Cowards with guns... Doing all the shooting because they can't fight don't know how to use their hands suckers
We all know who it is before even seeing.
Where are BLM? Where's Bono?
These things were supposed to bring communities together, some people just belong in prison!
Big surprise
what happened to good old fist fight?
This is.... Your AMERICA.... WOW... WHAT A WONDERFUL RACE OF PEOPLE ....
When will people realize a camera is always rolling. Lock him up and throw away the key.
Americas original sin
What is a 20 year old doing around HS kids
Peaceful riots . They started with throwing water on police . Lefties are not about to change
Imagine my surprise.
He probably saved some other person's life.  He appears aligned to shoot someone.  It was just a matter of time and place.
Arrested development at its finest.
I hope he gets life! You kill you pay the price, simple is that.
Just scary how fast people make use of guns these days..want ur shoes? let me shoot u..lost an argument? let me shoot u..looked at me the wrong way? let me shoot u..wrong color of clothing? let me shoot u...let aside they maybe end someones life...they throw away their own for litteraly nothing...i just dont get it
Trash.
Many n words are soo stupid. Jump while shooting a gun with one hand
One thing is for sure these specimens are not BLM members.
But my momma says I was a guud boi n I don't s cause no prob ms
Lmfao .
Diversity is so wonderful!!!
The video speaks loudly of what the problem is....not guns.
The Needgro
No regard for life, then why should he get to keep his own?
If every state in the u.s. had Swift capital punishment there would be a lot less murders. People don't fear the law because there's hardly ever any hard punishment. Kill somebody; do 10 years in prison no biggie
sad the boy couldn't even graduate and finish his life cause now  his parents got to bury him smh
Can ANYONE explain to me why its become a badge of honor to have murdered someone 🤔? It's become glorified amongst this NEw generation. SMH....
Call LeBrown o wherever name is to see is this is ok
WHAT??? will Ever stop these people from killing each other. Thugs with guns don’t mix
NO self-control!
I was so shocked when I seen the shooter 😏
Amazing how people are willing to take a life, ruin their own, all for absolutely nothing
He shot the kid because he was no part of the fun....no one invited him
Wow what a loser 😔🤥🙈
Theres an epidemic of mentally unstable  folks tht do not kno how to enjoy life or can not handle seeing others having fun  sad sad situations.. hateful azz folks ..
High school is deadly
One things for certain you won't see this on CNN
Awww such self control taught by NOT HIS MOM
Nigga moment.                     -Boondocks
This is why you only find the safe parks in the w8t neighborhoods.
I bet Lebron James is an icon for both sides.
Gangs members and students. Play stupid games win crazy prizes!
See when society sees a specific racial group that's so violent towards one another and has no respect for itself, how do you think we all look at you??
In the early 2000s I can remember being in my neighborhood on the 4th of July and havin rival gang members drive down the street shooting Roman candles at their opponents instead of bullets for a change. Now you mean to tell me water gun fights are resulting in real bullets flying 🤦🏽‍♀️   Sometimes I really hate it here.
Dude: No feeling with that!! Let me switch with the real deal just to see.  Dude: 👀 👀 Peace to the family!!
I would have love hear about just the kids having fun but I guess that's not the world we live in anymore. R.i.p to that child who lost his life over meaningless violence.
That's so fkn stupid and sad former students reliving they glory days u can tell with no future 😒 brought real guns to water gun fight smh hating on the new graduating class 😡
All over he was scared to get wet
I remember when these types of water guns came out. I had 3 of them that looked like freakin' rifles ( it was the 80's). I gave them to all of my friends and we shot up a neighbor who was on her back porch weaponless. She goes into the house gets a bucket of water and throws it on all of us while we weren't looking. We all laughed. End of story. No one was shot over water!
Overly sensitive boys are one of the biggest threats to human life.
Yes, let's make it safer for everyone, not just gun totin' double gz.
Don't post your true feelings, the woke CEO of YouTube can't handle the truth.
MORE WOKE BIDEN BRATS NOT PLAYING NICE WITH OTHERS
Guess someone's boo got her hair wet
We had the same type of fun this weekend! It’s water 💧 😩! It’s not that serious! Truly we are living in the last days!
This generation is screwed.🙄🙄🙄🙄
SMH!!!My Condolences to the Family and Friends also this Community.
Fatherless boys raised without discipline. Result of the "The Great Society"? Sad.
'Having fun in the park"...............yeah....keep it out of the parking lot. No doubt honor students just playing out.
This kid needs his CCW revoked.
Oh crap people of color shocking.
All cops need to say hell no to patrolling these neighborhoods. Let them police themselves!!
They wonder why nobody trusts them or wants these ''grandma's kids around!
They were jealous that they were having wholesome fun
Why are these people so stupid?
Never take a squirt gun to a gunfight.
Allegedly???
This is why we can’t have nice stuff
I don't care what these idiots do to each other.
**Gunfire is Exchanged"?** Bullets versus water is hardly *"gunfire" exchange*
In this case the gun made them stupider.....str8 dumb
damn I stay goin to dis park
Democrats can't handle their guns.
This Breaks my Heart 💔.  Growing up in Clayton county we didn't do things like this!!  If we got in a fight we used our Fists  then would sit & have a Drink or Smoke!  We watched out for each other!  I Never saw this kind of Hate!!
He couldnt leave well enough alone and go back to playing basketball. He just had to come over and start trouble. Theres a bumper crop of violence in Atlanta. I wish I could say things will improve but this has been happening far too long.
SCHOOL SHOOTER?
So sad! Kids having fun then one ends up dead!! R.I.P.🙏
always has to be one of those guys in a bunch, always. words hurt my feelings bro :(
If only someone would have called LeBron and none of this would have happened.  After all, he's really good at basketball.   Another lowlife, POS murdering their own.  six  /  Ninety four   If you don't think this is a self inflicted problem, then YOU are part of that problem.
Dude needs some TP to get that cling-on off his right ear......
*BLM🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕*
What do you want to bet it started over "respeck"?
That dude is history
Why you be wetting my FREE Jordan's foo... pow pow pow
Blm
Sean Allen your needed to the principles office immediately...Sean Allen...Sean Allen..
I wonder if these people committing crimes feel any embarrassment at just how STUPID they are?  All locked -up like a rabid dog.  Idiot that simply can’t live in society so he lives inna cage and chained up.  Really funny tho 🤣
You can clearly tell who started that 💀💀 I hope bruh does some real time
BLM ! Oh wait, there wasn’t a cop involved? Okay Nvm
Damn I forgot my watergun. Ah well I'll use my real one.
Have they found Kyle Rittenhouse yet ?
Don’t worry they will blame water guns! Water guns and fun equals shots fired!
Wait so did one of the high schoolers accidentally shoot him with the water gun or something? Or hit them with a water balloon, and that's what started it?
Prank gone wrong.
fake news
Show me your freinds and I'll show you your future
Cant even have a damn water gun fight without someone pulling out a real gun. Bruh I swear to God I'm sick of us. I used to say "when will we ever change." Now I'm wondering "will we ever change?" 😢
This was a BLM sponsored event.
These morons running around with guns and don't have enough brains to make a productive life let alone play with guns! The water gun kids were having wholesome fun
A young man is dead for NOTHING!  Rest In Peace.
Cant even go have a simple water gun fight. Wassup with these young demons out here smh
Make them dig holes, digging holes builds character
Lol
I've never thought of shooting someone with a "real" gun that was using a squirt gun !  This is pure genius. Sure hope the "SUSPECT" gets a fair trial !
Adding to the stereotype I see.
If I’m in a Hot Basketball game I’m looking to hit with some H2O... what a bunch hoodlums!
Pure elegance !  I love it !!
Smfh. F**kin weirdos always messin up the fun. SIP 🙏🏽
Stop disappointing your Love ones.  Satan hates good. Every good and perfect gift comes from above.
And ppl keep blaming the police officers!! Look at this! Parents of these thugs are left off the hook! And never held accountable...
Wheres blm protesters
You people must not have kids if you can't raise them like a human being.
This doesn't surprise me anymore 🙄
Just let them do what they do, don't get involved
When opps are trying to have a good time in the park but rivals are nearby...
This is very sad. You almsot cant go anywhere or do anything these days without tradegy striking. I took my boys to the park last week and they were involved in a game of basket ball. Trash talk is normal during a game of Basketball but there was one boy there that was  very angry and trash talking a little too much.  He stood out amongst all the teenagers out playing in all of his huffing, puffing, and cussing! He raised my atenas. I'm so glad Ive taught my children to ignore ignorance cause if my son would have said one word back Im sure that would have set that young man off.
Get em off the street. Every body wanna be tough let’s see how he does in prison
That goes to show you how dumb these kids are you on camera broad daylight and you think you're not going to jail
These fools are crazy. Stop being Evil. Stop the madness.
Where’s labron ? Where’s sharpton ? Where’s crum ? Where are all of the race baiters ..?
If they act as a group they need to joint jail as a group who wants that team in the streets or near other students 🤔🤔
Smfh ruined his whole life over what?
Enjoy ur new life
Who brings a real gun to water gun fight.  Oh oh oh I know. Criminals
I’m sure that this is not the first time this thug has murdered someone. It shows that thugs like this should be hunted down like wild dogs.
There are too many dumb thinking young people in this world.
what a coward
Only in America  The land of the gun ,the good the bad and the ugly
And another example of who is the number one killer of them huh
Man dam kids can't have fun anymore I really blame poor parenting Internet has took over our kids lives. Play play gangstas trying to be something their not y'all drop out of school so don't bring y'all misery over to the kids who still are trying to make something of themselves make no sense
Wow guess he didn’t want to get wet smh
Oh America
We need to get rid of them all
Horrible shooting an unarmed kid in the back!!!! Prison for life!!!
Why are "former students" even allowed on the school property or the basket ball court? Seems school officials are not interested in the safety of the current students.
They make good athletes but not much else....
Unreal how a persons ego can cause such destruction.
So actually the water guns had zero to do with it
Stay away from Losers ☝️
Georgia has the death penalty.....idiot threw his life away...RIP young man
Dam if they getting their frustration out by water guns and balloons, is awesome,  then the dumb azz folks come in with real guns, smdh
This is why I'm pro-abortion and getting Baptism right afterwards if you can't raise your children with morals.
was not a watergun fight that turned deadly...it was a bunch of kids playing, when an adult attacked and murdered one.  Might as well say that a basketball game turned deadly
You can't even have fun no more
Yikes! A lot of comments in here are basing an entire community off of the assholes we see on tv. The assholes will always be the ones that makes the news. Remember, for each race, there are an overwhelming amount good people vs the amount of assholes you see on tv.  I don’t blame the media for the misconception, because it’s not their job to remind people that fact; it just common knowledge that most people aren’t assholes
Why
He must have got his ass whopped
What a shame, this is really upsetting!!! 🥺 I'll just stop now.
That reporter lady fine as hell
Wake up brothers and sisters. Know your kids. Don't be there friends. Don't ever be to busy. Know your house. These young people need leadership and guidance like, yesterday!
Another coward thinks he's a man shooting someone for no reason !! By by coward rot in prison
So the group that came in the car need to be charge with capital murder
BLM = BUYING LARGE MANSIONS!
Cant even have fun in America no more
Who brings a gun to the basketball court?
Need a good guy with a water gun.
The craziest smh
Mandated+WellOrchestrated= Violent Culture Created  And Now The Mad Scientist 👨🏻‍💼...WTF? 😲..... Have We Done?👨‍💻👨‍🔬🤦🏻🧑‍🔬🤷 #ForTheLoveOfPower&Money
I love how people think they’re “hard” because you got a gun! As far as I’m concerned you’re the biggest Coward out of all of them! I sure hope whoever the Bubba is in his jail get him nice and good!
Here they are having fun and this creep pulls out a gun what a goof ball!!
Everyone of the basketball players shpuld be charged an accessory and get long prison sentences as well.  Fayette county when i lived there was know as a law and order community.
Wouldn’t go to the USA if you gave me a free ticket
Just SAD AND SICKENING!
Democrat trash.
Lord it's a shame.They couldn't play in fun & games without somebody getting killed or injured.thats why I don't like playing with nobody.because I know it can quickly turn into something serious.
Another felon with a gun. Obviously not a law abiding citizen...
For no f×+king reason..man eye'm sick
Bums threw your whole life away deuces
Yall are fkn pathetic raise ur fkn kids
Just sad!!!
Your CULTURE is broken.  Fix it.
Sad!!
What a loser.  He couldn’t take losing in a watergun fight to a kid 🤦🏾‍♂️
Last name of victim same as a company is that random?
Is that a surprise to anyone?
The deadliest water gun ever....ban all water guns. Get the Dems involved
Looks like dude who got shot pulled a gun first, so that's self defense not murder that's why he turned himself in !
Lmfao. Cant fix stupid.
How deez chillin's pass dey background checks fo dem guns?
That waste of a human came out shirtless and ready to fight. This was first degree murder.
Man WTF! KIDS CAN'T EVEN PLAY NO MORE! I CAN NEVER RELATE TO WHEN A GANGSTER TARGETS CIVILIANS 🤯 DONT MAKE SENSE @ ALL! 🙏
Geesh, can't even play these days...WTH
How long before this is “Whiteys” fault
Joggers. Go figure
He would have given u the shirt off of his back 😂
Gimme you're lunch money!!! No. Bangor bang bang....,.  Sadlanta is the new city name..
How come they're not working or in college/technicall school, hanging out after you graduated, dumb dumb no direction, or goals, just hangout and fight.
Real homiez don't let homiez do foolish shyt 💩
Yeah, them blm really matter to themselves...
How long has Atlanta been a $hit hole?  FOREVER!!!!
Alleged? He did fire the shot... It's seen on video. RIP to the young man.
There is a defect in the minds of these demons.
Smh didnt the social workers tell them BLM? Why are these fine future NASA scientists killing each other on the daily?
no worries, dude will get a plea deal and be out in 3 years
Can’t even play no more
Punk. Can't handle a watergun fight.
The ultimate usual suspects (to the 10,000th power)  Every 10 mins, of every hr, all day long...
Just wow
BLM
What is wrong with kids today!?
sounds like a very intelligent group of people
We people who are darker than blue. ... Are we gonna stand around this town and let what others say come true. 👊
They were just looking to start something. That's how Satan...  😡👉 😈 (The Jerk of Jerks) works!
Just thinking a few short years when that suspect has a felony warrant for his arrest due to this incident he's going to be the one that resists police and cause a lot of innocent people to suffer.
Give em guns, step back and watch em kill each other.  2 pac said it best.
BLM Water Park Fun!!!
Wow
I hope that he gets life in prison!!! and my prayers goes out to the young man who passed😔
Why was he in the park carrying a gun when he was supposed to be in his pre-med classes?  Thats what I want to know.
YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN ANYMORE, JUST TOOK THAT YOUNG MAN LIFE, THIS WAS THE SHOOTER TIME TO GET SOME OVER REACTED ATTENTION
From water gun to a REAL GUN fast. I hope the thug(YES THUG) get life and he can be as tough as he want IN JAIL.
We hate each other this much?
Idiots everywhere. :(
There is something wrong with these people
geez gang gang huh???
Somebody is scared of water.
Man water guns are a gateway now
So much for BLM. No respect for life or our laws. Life in prison without parole upon conviction
These people will all kill each other off if they’re not careful.
LMAOOOOOOO
Always bad when two tribes come together.  Last week that happened in NYC at a birthday party--the birthday boy was shot dead in his stroller.  Will be an interesting summer in the cities.
Mean while LeBron and stupid BLM activists  claim police are the main cause of death amongst blks in America. Blame the trashy rap music, that they allow to play on radio stations, rap music preaches violence, racial slurs, disrespecting women, selling drugs and the list goes on.
Why am i not SURPRISED!! 🤨
We are the weakest form of humanity now if we have to rely on a gun to solve a problem. How come this gun violence didn't happen in the eighties or '90s but too bad this must stem from people not raising their kids right and now we're stuck in this generation of violence
What asshat brings a gun to a water gun fight? You don't have to answer, its rhetorical as I already know the answer.  I see it hourly across the country.  Same cast 97% of the videos I see.
"Exchanged gunfire"? So the students had guns besides squirt guns?
This is ridiculous...my condolences to the family.🤦🏿
Water gun fight water Dung  fight orisha Ogun it's the pooppacolypse 💩
BLM?
Harvard Jogger graduates just trying to show everyone their diplomas.... Colin Flaherty spoke about this....
Lebron James and BLM have any comment on this. Or no all lives matter?
What a loser. I hope spending life in prison was worth it!
I'm dying to know what chicken sandmich they fightin over.
The oppressed lol
You can’t even have a playful water gun fight without an animal who was never taught right from wrong, consequences for their actions, or how to be a decent person. How do people literally take others like like it’s nothing. That was a human who had family, friends, live ones and these animals kill people and have no remorse. Soulless devils.
Playing basketball while carrying a    gun. FUTURE N B A !
Arrest them alll and the parents  deport them all
A disgrace!
Dude was probably just sticking up for his friends
387th lol
Parents, those are your children.
If we speak truth anywhere in this new democratic country of doom we are labeled.
Its the culture that has to change .
Just by looking at the crowd, I can tell this is a great school to send your kids. I bet the average GPA there is 1.7. I'm surprised LeBron didn't send his kids there.
The park would be a lot safer if water guns were the only artillery allowed on the premises.
Hopefully he shares a cell with “tiny”.  That’ll wet him up
And I use to wonder why my mom use to never allow water guns nerf guns no type of guns bcus it does something to a kids mind
Want to make the park safer? Get rid of the freakin BB court.
This is why I don't play like that.  I may be 47 now, but I'm saying that 30 or so years ago...I STILL didn't like contact 'sports'.  Everyone doesn't play fair and some people are sore losers.
There is reason why people afraid of them and avoid them.
You gotta be a real low life to be 22 years old starting beef with high school kids...
Well, we know who wasn't invited to have water balloon fights as a child 🤦‍♂️
And the lesson here is.... there is no lesson here, only stupidity.
Just like a knife fight?
Squirt guns
And people wonder why neighbors are worried when these  "kids" move into a neighborhood.
Why wasn't he at work?🤦🏾‍♂️
Wow that is beyond insane.....
Dude musta water gunned his eye & he called foul. Should’ve worn goggles.
Damn people don’t even know how to have fun anymore smh
Why ppl suckers with guns.?? Throw the fair one.. you get your ass whip then  that's it.  Now you are gonna be behind bars for senseless acts.
To ensure safety of the park and community is by having stable homes. You know, like having a mother and father to raise stable children into adults. The result of single parent hood
They need to ban squirt guns
not shocked
Can just attach number tags to these animals instead of naming them?
RIP🎈🌹🙏 Amen
BLM! BLM! BLM!
Gonna be a long hot summer.
Water is racist. That's what did it.
Death penalty. If a person kills someone for playing water guns, there isn't a shred of humanity within them. "I was playing basketball. Minding my own business. When these kids got my car wet. So, one of them had to die. No lives matter." 22 years old, but had less sense than someone half his age.
Insanity
22 year olds acting like teenagers might as well change adult hood from 18 to 25
where’s blm?
Nijina's 😀 in full affect.
Always has to be a want to be Tough guy . Trying to show off in front off his friends.  Smh 🙄
Look at that fool trying to walk around like he a true Gangster. He bout to be a real butt pirate in prison.
Ok so it was a watergun fight that ended up with a person shooting someone and killing someone with a real gun.Hmm...ok.
Sad
Just stop talking and show us the entire video
Death or life without parole, should never be aloud to see the light of day
Dont bring a water gun to a gun fight
It's not an alleged shooting and murder if it's clearly on video.
Dumorats ruining everything they touch
Sign of the time's
I seriously can't with yall. Yall really can't just grieve for the young man right now. Yall wanna keep bring "BLM" into this when it has nothing to do with it. And I'm tired of seeing yall mfs say "but they want their life to matter?" Like stfu nobody needs any words from land stealing mfs, rapists, and beaters. I don't got mf time to hear anything from YAll. I'm tired. So stfu. The main thing here is that a young man died that it. He didn't get to live life. It's sad.
Don't hit a STRANGER with your water gun. I guess voters voted for this MESS; you voters got what you bargained for. SMH
Lebron James is ok with this ✊🏿
Squirt Guns Madder
Peaceful protesters.
Brought the wrong gun to a gun fight... LOL
So sad our people hate themselves. No love no compassion no regards for life.
Now, the suspect is regretting and cry like a baby, no more show off.
As long as they are killing each other, I’m passed caring about them or their culture.
Hillary C told us that supper predators do not like water or swimming they should know better.
I hope he have the roughest time in prison cause this was senseless. He can show out in prison now
Guess the demographic win a beer
The garbage of the garbage
Yuck.
LEBRON I am anxiously awaiting your Tweet about this!
I guess he didnt want his corn rolls wet
that is sad ' that coward took a life!!!!!
Teenagers gonna teenage.
What led up to the violence,,,are you kidding me
This is WHY need POLICE. It's so sad seeing how quickly a whose Balls are bigger contest between CHILDREN turned deadly. I hope people understand that the killer HAD a gun on him and SO DID HIS BUDDIES. You know they didn't get them legally. KILLERS AND THUGS will always FIND a way to ARM THEMSELVES. I don't care If YOU SAY NO MORE GUNS that will NOT stop them. WE NEED MORE TRAINING FOR OUR OFFICERS AND MORE STAFF. if the Cops are cut off, who would find and put away these bad guys? who would fight for your family?
New Idea. Remove all basketball courts from public parks
Kids with guns.
A bunch of good kids injoying the weather,an then here comes the animals yes the animals this man pictured here doesn't deserve to live he took a life so now either he owes his life or rot in hell
BLM
BLM ✊🏿 lol wow these are kids
What a foolish ass!! S. Allen should be ashamed of himself. What ignorant jackass! They were having fun with squirt guns and water balloons. Why did he bother them. His guns falls down and shoots someone's foot. Then he gets a gun from someone else. O boy was looking for trouble and found it!! My condolences to the family of the one that died. May he rest in peace. When will we learn!!!! Life is short enough. May GOD bless us all.
Acts like this go completely against having our lives matter when we keep killing each other. Stupidity at its best. AGAIN, one dead, one criminally dead and two families and countless friends in mourning.  This continues to happen too much in our communities.  This on-going evil needs to be addressed.  The number of dead in the Atlanta area from senseless killings like this is already too high.
Four years since graduating hanging out at former High School. Add that to your resume when applying for Job.
WTH is wrong with these people! Hope that guy never gets out. Prayers for the young mans family.
Those were clearly Assault Water Guns with illegal 1 Gallon Clips
These are good boys.  Just ask their family.  They all attend church and many play in the church choir, some go fishing with the fathers, and most were getting ready to attend junior college this fall.
Damn...this guy took water gun fights personally.
Wheres BLM in all this?
Guns don't make you a man, dude was all over his feeling. I hope the judge give him life
I gave you a like.. then I realized you were Fox "News" ... sooo , I took it back.. 🤣
BLM has to be on it's last legs by now.
Really still same ole lames...
I wonder if this was one of those situations when the basketball group saw the water fight in the parking lot where their cars were parked and figured they will demand the group having the water fight not play around their cars...
Nah what I see is normal kids having fun with squirt guns and then demon crew rolls up doing demon time and destroys. There are people out here who are no longer human and they cannot be rehabilitated or live with us
Useless eater.
And blm hahahahahahahaha Sigh......keep up the good work you silly kids
You can't make a park safe, if the people who use the park are dangerous.
*SOOOO SAD* 😥
Psalm 9:17 is a law that can’t be overturned!
Didndonuffin he was a good boy
blm spreading more peace and unity
Stupid
Big a play game with other man smh
BIG DUMMIES !
Looks like a great place to take the family for a picnic
Just doing what the leaders in those communities encourage then to do
The suspect is cute.
BLM.
And guess what...they were all whites racist’s!!!
Dude brought a real gun to a water gun fight.
But aren't school are "gun free zone"? how could this happened, our lawmakers have laws against this type of behaviors
Let those people kill each other no problem, I don't care those devil at all.
Humans are the bane of my existence
Lock that POS away for 100 years no parole.
Thank you rap music
Just trying to show off. Coward can't fight without a gun
Was it worth it...
We are our own oppressors, can't even have fun no more 😔
Name that race!
BLM spawn, where's the peaceful protests!
Smh
Fukkery
Typical
Another "Meeting" yeah....that will change things.!
Never bring a water balloon to a gunfight!😂
Idiots man. People are so scared to take a punch but have no problem taking a life. 😒
Male Karen
How could something so fun and innocent escalate to something so deadly?!
LeBron says “this is just what us folks do!”
The shooter was a Gremlin he was afraid to get wet dam demon
What a dumb ass to ruin his life and victims family's life including his own family's life over nothing. He should get life without parole
I hope he serve the max. For this crime.. bringing a gun To a innocent water 💧balloon  And water 💧gun fight.. Moron.. got to call it like it really is..pathetic
Idiots
One less Biden voter! Yay!
Can’t even have fun anymore. Very embarrassing and sad
The most common hate crimes in America are same race hate crimes.
blm
Where’s blm
THUG..
Hopefully he wouldn’t go around shooting unarmed kids.
But BLM what a joke!!!
Good luck.
Just one of those high school gun fights we all had growing up. Really brings me back
Notice the demographics.  Do I need to say anything else
Is all about culture...fake news
Cowards always comes in numbers, trouble usually comes in pairs
Water gun control... we need to limit the amount of water that goes into each water gun.
Usual suspects
To put a full time officer in the park to protect the KIDS.He could take his donuts with him.
Same people same gun violence.....!
Looks like alot of fortnite players
Al this over water though? Like huh?  Water guns tho. People we got do better. Like someone is dead over water gunshots? Smh
Welcome to Lebrons America
This young man kill a high school kid over fun.Both life changes in second. High school die and the thug has a lifetime sentence
I wanna see the full video, I was their but it wasn’t much I could do.
Sad
So stupid. Teenagers having fun shooting a water gun and a lowlife thug had to ruin it for everyone.
It would seem as if there was enough TAXPAYER money to put an of
what a punk
The HS Students were approached by former students who had Dropped-Out to start of Life of Thuggery
WTF?!
He’ll be someone’s bitch in prison.😈
Another great citizen. Probably has record a mile long and still walking free. Cowards.
I miss the 80's.  When tempers flared and it wasn't resolving, we used our fists, one on one.  99% of the time when the other guy said "okay I'm done", the winner stopped and accepted that and both parties moved on.  The 1% who took things out of hand tended to be known about and dealt with (get his ass beat hard, basically).  Now, some cowards just shoot to kill if they get the slightest bit angry.
charge that whole group with murder one and then if they are all found guilty Kill them all!
And what about his whole squad of goons? They get off scott free
🎵🎵🎵BLLLLLMMMMMM🎵🎵🎵
How’s the demonize and defund the police movement working out for you Atlanta?
Joggers have low impulse control.
2021 so..@#.
The usual suspects, as usual. Is anyone REALLY surprised?
Stupid.
LEBRON PLEASE TELL ME WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE
Sorry but, "racism" SAVES LIVES!  You HAVE TO discriminate at times, you have to judge and be weary of individuals who fit the description and has all the red flags.  If I saw this crowd at that parking lot, I wouldn't even pull in.  So yeah, I'm a racist!
WeRE iS LEbrOn mY nAmE Is JoHn SmITh
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE DUM ASS...
Damn. Can’t even have fun with water guns these days without some idiot feeling like a big bad ass. Smh. Pu**y
Folks can’t even have fun any more
Sounds like a wholesome high school to grow up in
He won't have access to guns in prison while others are busting their water balloons all up in him lol
water   something was missing  they fixed it
People can’t just box it out anymore 🤦‍♂️
guns on the school yard...
Can't even have fun at the park anymore. Kulture of Vilence
The shooters mammy during an interview:  "Him wudda a gud bwah hoo wuddaboutta go tuh kawlege skool an git his degreaser."
BLM
Cnn: he pulled the wrong gun from wrong side of hip he thought he pulled his water pistol to play back
They from fayetteville,  these are silver spoon kids
Ignorance is lit , intelligence is lame, definitely satanic.
SENSELESS!!!!!
Fox5 Atlanta?? Say no more.
there teachers must be proud
Former student ?! He’s 22 years old . He went there when the other kid was in Jr. High school !! Wtf ! I hope he never gets out !
It won't be safer till hoodlums like that are forced  into captivity
America is indeed very diverse.
Blm in action 🎬 again.... so, where's the outcry???
no offense but once the first pistol came out it was time to go, no reason to wait around for the second heater to come out
Even when kids are out behaving and having fun.  Others have to F it up. They came from the basketball court.  Why?  Was it just because others with in "their" park??
It’s evolving, just backwards
He a mama boy
Why don't they have jobs?
Typical~ WB-USMC-RET.
thats not a proper shooting stance
KneEguZ ThezE DayZ
Enjoy hot dogs for the next 20 years 🌭
And there they are again being hunted down in the streets by the Police...Oh wait...
Defund!
Potato cameras - who makes those?
Big Mike's sons are out of control
This was nothing but a case of the  former high schoolers trying to act tough in front of the current high school girls by bullying the current high school boys and it ended tragically. Trust me 💯 percent
Ruined again by the oppressed.  Shooters gotta go.
Lebron James, we need you!!
Defund the police!!!!! Teenagers fight with knives whats wrong in this
thats really sad. They were having fun and this guy had to come and ruin the fun :(
Good thing there were no police in the park.  Things could have gotten out of hand.
im sure the parents that support BLM and defunding the police will be asking for the police to arrest this guy... lol
Can't even have fun..NOPE.
Young people, guns and violence in a park parking lot, what is going on with our young people? Where are the parents and adults in these young people's lives? This is happening all over .......
Well, I guess the shooter got the respect he felt he needed - for a second. Now, he gets the next 25 years to life to savor the moment, What an idiot...
dont they know their lives matter?
Such a innocent game .... turned in the wrong direction... How?🤦‍♀️
Seriously 😳😳....we shooting kids over water balloons now?
First @702🎲🎲, that was f*cked up!!!🛑🛑🛑Im sick of this sh*t!!!
Too much water from that last blasts is what escalated this.
"Guns Drawn by the Basketball Players" Sounds about right.🤣🤣
