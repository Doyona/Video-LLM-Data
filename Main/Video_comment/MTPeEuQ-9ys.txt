I see
wonderful rocky video
Hallo Fabi👋
BEGGING for a short film/series. i NEED to see more adventures of postwoman dodie. this is a cinematic masterpiece
Crazy how this was 4 years ago. Dodie your so generationally talented.
Gosh. I love the story telling in this video. She could have done the expected and made a video about misunderstandings between two awkward individuals (which I would eat up as well) but she chose to tell another story of perseverance and challenging one's self to achieve something. Two relatable stories in one video. And it's nice to see the unexpected. Very empowering. Great job Dodie and crew! 👏🏼
That's why im out of the mailman game, too many sweats.
this song used to go platinum in my house
i hate my self
The postman was a great film.
Keep going
Bc she feels like it's her job to make sure the messages are communicated :) so if communication isn't happening she's gonna take the responsibility of working harder to make sure it can happen
For some reason, when I watch this, I feel like I don’t have to put down everything I think of down on paper.
woke up at 3am, remembered this music video existed, not thought about it in years, looked it up, as good as i remembered.
Thank You Forrest 💕
Me playing the Dragon Roost Island letter mini game: 0:46
I Love you and All of your family, and friends that help you do what you do. The music and videos I have had the privilege of experiencing, have made me instantly feel all emotions. And this is the most amazing thing to me. You wonderful people making me feel all of my emotions at the same time. I cry , and laugh all at once ❤ thank you so much. And again I say to you,,😢 when are you coming to San Diego 😂.
magic
I love the "mm mm mm" At the beginning of the the song 😊
As a postman, I can confirm this is what we be doing
Is that North Devon?
Something I can ……relate 2

First I would like to thank your parents for bringing you into this world . I hope one day I get the honor of meeting you. Peace love and happiness is what you have given to my soul.
I love this, layers of meaning in the craftmanship, so clever!
This musical fairy person is cute as fuck. Give me back the hour you took being infatuated with your music I haven't heard until tonight. Thank you for creating. It makes me happy 😊
Of all places, I first heard this song in McDonalds! And yeah, I’m gonna say it… I’m lovin it ❤
“NEITHER RAIN NOR SNOW NOR GLOM OF NIT CAN STAY THESE MESENGERS ABOT THEIR DUTY”
COOL)
Weirdest (but possibly best) Rocky Sequel yet
Dodie has been giving us bangers for over a decade and we don’t deserve it
I would really love to know if your lyrics are derived from inspiration or craft.  I suspect both.  Truly impressive either way. I love your work.
My autism-induced anxiety in a nutshell
I've just been introduced to your music, and I thank the algorithm for it (even if it _is_ Skynet). This is one of my new favorite songs and one of my favorite music videos ever. Your music is my kind of poetry. You're some of the few that actually speak to my "soul." 🥰🤩
The lyrics describe my experience with being an undiagnosed autistic almost perfectly. The social anxiety turns obsessive, causing meltdowns. Masking is tough and this is exactly the feeling I get when I suspect I might have done  something wrong socially, however small.
What is the shoot location? The vibes are immaculate
i can really relate to this banger...
This is the prettiest ❤
This is such a violently English video
Wait- so I'm thinking that she not only found a more efficient way to deliver her letters, but also now picks and chooses which ones are most important to her? Calmly walking through the rest because sending them all would be unrealistic for her?  If these letters are each thoughts or emotions she cares about delivering to those in her life, then maybe she's understanding that sometimes people will misunderstand, and she can't spend 24/7 trying to deliver every single message she has.
🥰🥰🥰
back again, gracias
So this is why my mail is always fucked up
i think this might be my favourite music video ever
Masterpiece.
itu dari delayota
Such a great video!
I actually love hearing the squeaks on the strings here. Real music. Beautiful.
Moral of the history: buy a bycicle.
Wow, Dodie, you are a breath of fresh air!
noice metaphor :P
I love this music video with my life
not sure anybody has ever managed to capture my interaction with those i love quite this well   thanks for making me feel a little less alone and odd
damn this is beautiful  she got attacked by vecna at the end
Every time i watch the clip now its like 3:24 Dodie's about to get her limbs snapped by vecna
My real name is Dodie. No joke! Hahahah subscribed!!!
Music videos from Dodie just always turn out to be the best!! they really sell the lyrics for me
Where is this shot ?!
MV goes 🔥🔥
Damn this is my whole therapy requirements in one fab song thank you
I relate because for the Dodie concert yesterday I needed to plan out EVERYTHING and made everything a problem. What if I can't find a parking spot? What if we can't drive away immidiately? What if I'm too tired to drive? What if I can't see anything? What if I take a wrong turn? Etc. etc. Had to figure out every little thing even though othe rpeople would have just looked up the general adress and drove there and see the rest when they arrived.
I love that Dodie's commitment to drip means she's going for runs in skirts. Honestly if I were a girl/it were a bit more publicly acceptable for men I would 100% copy her style because I am in love with it
Super concert at munich.💯top Level.
Love this!!
Dodie Someone I grew up with His wife runs 2 post office  in very a rural part of Vermont, Neat. I think Artists question themselves  realizing there is a gap between art and the work place I think as an Artist I would be disappointed if I had no other skills or understanding of the working world Gears and Piers and Cards all jobs are social by nature. Not everyone can do art its enjoyed it's listened then in later  years recalled as a symbolism of emotional times and seen as a generation also. Art never goes away Because it has a spiritual value                                                    before it was monetary. really when a person accesses the tool of imagination then you might end up with a lot thoughts. most things that are made or designed don't change that quickly they already have been created. what people do as supportive is to keeping things interesting
“oh i don’t think i can help it” on the second time the bridge plays is when dodie wraps a bandaid around her paper cut. i like to think it’s the music video alluding to the fact that, in fact, can be helped. changing the people who we allow in our life and changing our boundaries (her putting on the uniform) can help a lot more than we think.
What??
Does anybody know where the video takes place?
dodie i love u sm 🥹🫶🏻
i admire this mv sm and i can't stop watching it
Dodie's songwriting and production have come soso far since I first came around in 2014-15 ish and it makes me so happy
This is insanely adorable & underrated 💕🙏
Affirming, the blend of melancholy, humour and sadness settle my heart
Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Do you look angry? Oh, what did I say? Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh, How do we get here Every time? One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me No, I don't think I can help it (Nope) Oh, so illogical I'm not magical, I can't read your mind But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh, what if I laugh now Think I'm insane Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose Oh, one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me No, I don't think I can help it Oh, so illogical I'm not magical, I can't read your mind But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh, something that must be done I'm open and ready here Don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how I'm only worth losing now Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm open and ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear No, I don't think (Don't think they get me, dear) I can help it (Don't think they get me, dear) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me, dear) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) (Don't think they get me, dear)
MY NEW FAVORITE
I really like this woman's universe, her voice, her diction, the sound and production are great. Amazing
major props to the video producer <3 Oh... and i just love this song ;)
i wanted to be a postman for a solid week after this music video came out
This song honestly is exactly what I feel like
I love the woman's facial expression at 3:04
9000
this is 1 year old today, listened at least 300 hundred times....
best metaphor i have seen ever
I LOVE this! The sounds, the sounds! All the squeaks of the guitar, the layers of the instruments, and I especially love the little taps during the chorus! And your voice pairs so well with it! This is great!
The grandma in the window is one of my favorite details lol
I watched her playing a numbers card game on Tom Scott's channel
this sounds similar to the man by Taylor swift :0
Lyrics remind me of my autism :)
hello I'm here after Chan played your song 😊
if i was this skinny i definitely wouldn't hate myself
dodie is the epitome of creating something awesome with simple harmony ☺️
this reminds me of another song. i've heard this before i swear
Mom now i wanna be a postwoman
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC5z7vs2aXCH9M6cG2Mdik7Q/featured
There are no words to describe how it felt when I listened to this song for the first time. I'd never known how to put that feeling into words. I remember listening to it afterwards on repeat in bed, crying my eyes out with happiness and sadness.
Bethnal Greens royal mail operational manager stands by this.
I AM NEVER GONNA STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS SONG
Every single thing about this is just... amazing. Songwriting, production, mix, video, concept... wow.
Still coming back to this so many months later I love your music Dodie!!!!
This video is so precious to me....it's the realest struggle of trying to find your place in the world and all the small hurdles that actually turn out to be rather massive mountains until you conquer them.
I can't tell you how much I'm obsessed with this song especially when you know the meaning behind it, it makes it so much more meaningful. ✨
I've met my friends!!!!
I Like it
As someone who has BPD this song describes my current state pretty well. The guilt i feel is unbearable. Wish i had a friend like Dodie.
HAHAHAHAHAHA when you try to throw it through the gap in the chair ahahahahahahahaha
30 seconds into youtube autoplaying the next video I'm still audibly laughing at the premise of this video.
ASMR music
Verse 1] Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say? Filling in the gaps, build a problem that Neither of us needs, something wrong with me (Mmh-mmh-mmh) I'm getting desperate, losing my mind Oh, how do we get here, every time?

This is genius! Every single detail...
Man, Klaus is looking great.

I appreciate the moment to cuff the jeans, just so we don’t forget dodie’s bi
How can I forgot I saw this video ,grat video dodie ,is Hollywood knocking at your door ? dont open it that scouser is a pervert

I feel like this is a representation of Dodie’s mind when she’s trying to talk with her partner/ex-partner
This looks like a cool indie movie I wanna see
why isnt dodie the main character of a ghibli film yet?

There is something so calming about her voice.
Her music reminds me of Bill Wurtz songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKElk9zTB04
I LOVE A CHESS PARTNER,MMMMMMMMMMMM
"I LOVE YOU DODI"
Glad i have found many great singers in this quarantine❤💛❤💛
I love it
nooo your so good at sing!!!!
I know it'll never happen but I dream of her duo with Sufjan Stevens, it would be perfect.
Love ❤️
did she not learn from georges GF in seinfield
She really delivered the message
I can't believe how excited I am that Dodie has a proper music video.  And the song is awesome BTW... My new favourite!  It seems not all that long ago I discovered Dodies music because I saw her in one of Tom Scott's slightly more random videos.  I really hope it won't seem like all that long again untill I'm just a speck in a crowd, watching Dodie totaly rock it on stage, at the O².
I forgot this song name and literally searched, "hate me, hate you, hate yourself etc etc finally when I got it I was damn happy
This reminded me of that funny quote from Roy Keane a few years back.  "I'm just doing what I'm supposed to, that's my job! You don't praise the postman for delivering your letters?" True but well...Maybe we can make an exception for this particular "Postman."
Great song, great video. But all I can think about is how pissed off I'd be if my brown paper wrapped parcel was left on a wet step whilst it's raining. And for how many years I'd passive aggressively smile at my postie for it.
The title, same bro same
as a man, this song taught me something today about my perspective towards my relationship. thank you.
This is amazingly beautiful and awesome! <3 love it so much <3
Ngl, when I first listened to this I thought it was a nice one off song that I wont listen to in the future... holy damn! I'm addicted to it and 'I don't think I can help it' 😉🤣
Great piece of film work. Can anyone say where it was filmed? What town/where?
She should be reported for leaving parcels outside in the rain to get stolen!! + crap song. 👎
Yes but who is on the audio team?  These make themselves?
Can you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Thanks to all musicians for making life better! I know from my own experience that life can get tough, but if you listen to good songs you can get through it and keep going. Made some playlists for many moments in life. Come listen to them and leave me your opinion. I'm getting started. Thanks!
How has dodie never released a single bad song
So thats why my packages have been taking so long to get here.
This feels like a live action anime.  I love it.
Yeppi million viewsssss
when you go quite i hate myself
I love the concept of someone having such dedication to the postie role that they shadowbox letter-deliver on a quay.
I feel like this song and Cool Girl are kind of sister songs. They are both discussing the feeling of social anxiety in everyday conversation and interaction, More specifically with romantic relationships.  It can be really hard to not overthink everything a romantic interest might be thinking or doing, which can usually lead one to thinking it was something that they did "wrong". I think in this video, her mail route represents how effectively she can get through her anxious thoughts and calm down before she gets tired and gets stranded in the middle of her anxiety. Her training regimen is really just her practicing processing her thoughts and getting the anxiety "delivered" to where it should go, until she eventually masters it.   Cool girl, I believe is how she outwardly tries to convince herself that she wont give in to her anxieties. The "Cool Girl" she is speaking of is herself, but with keeping her emotions in check and not becoming erratic when they start to feel the anxiety from "hate myself". Cool Girl doesn't mind that that person hasn't messaged in a while, or Doesn't worry if they've made the other person upset, because she's worked on herself and wont get caught in those anxieties anymore.   Basically, TLDR: Hate Myself is dodie learning how to "beat" her anxiety and cool girl is what she says to herself about wanting to overcome the anxiety    Could totally be just for me though. i did my best to explain it lol
Awe this was directed by Sammy :")
3 months later and I still love this song
Here again in honor of album release!!
I love this song, I didn't realise how much someone else could get it.
I dont know the real interpretation of the lyrics but i relate to my own interpretation. for me, its like being mentally unstable in a relationship. i relate to that so much because id have these issues with my ex-partner but all internally. And usually i hide them because she wouldnt get it and itd just be me making another problem for us. Sometimes, i do try to open up and she wouldnt get it at all. Sometimes shed literally go quiet. And id just be there, all anxious, thinking of how much opening up was a mistake. I dont mean to make problems for us, i just cant help it. Thats just how my brain works.
I’ll try to love you enough for both of us.
She was so good at delivering mail that she transcended
violet evergarden???
💖💖💖
She sounds like she has a cold, or a blocked nose, her voice doesn’t sound right
This video scares me.... a lot
This is the weirdest and most amazing video
I like the optimism here, glad I found you ^^
Shit song
I enjoyed the first 8 seconds :D
I've never related more to a song
This is neat. ♡
camera quality it is look like a film how much doodle pay to make this?
This is cool!!! Tyyyy
On repeat ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I relate to this song on an spiritual level
This really helps me Im borderline (bpd) and this is exactly how I feel , you never cease to to make such relatable, emotional,honest music I'm so glad your exist
There's joy in a simple job done well.
I don't know where this is, but I want to live there.
This is so creative and fresh! Whoever helped her putting this together, can be very proud.
Oooh loved this song and the mv is so good! You've been collabing with the best directors :D
👍👏❤️
this music video is a masterpiece
This village in Cornwall is one of my favourite places on the planet.
She’s like the Rocky Balboa of mail carriers! I adore you!
Yeah I hate myself too
Just here to say I JUST heard this song on the radio on my drive home from work. Seeing this, getting to hear it in it's full, this is awesome! Dodie, you're an amazing songwriter and lyricist. Keep it up and do what you love no matter what. You rock!
I can't understand what you're singing.. It's like your nose is full and you're overdoing a wierd british accent, it's quite bothering, couldn't enjoy. Oh, and I don't think I'v ever heard you use your full voice, like singing strong, just this mumbly, whispery quiet stuff, that just (to me) is like you're tryna hide your actual singing voice (perhaps because it isn't good enough to sound nice louder) or something. No hate here, honest opinion (stating this because people (stans??) are super jumpy nowadays).
Omg look at Dodie all grown up!! I think this is the turning point for me - and I can no longer see her as the teenage girl in her bedroom strumming a ukulele! 😭
i like the song but the way its sung is like asmr , irritates my ears
you must be a jedi
This song means so much more to me than when I first heard it. I always overthink everything and everytime someone ghosts me, I can only blame myself. I liked someone and things were good until it silently fell apart, I'm left trying to make sense of it, but unfortunately it goes to the worst possible outcome in my head.
To me this song is about social anxiety and the video is about learning to live with it in a healthy way <3
How r u so lyrically magical oh god
UwU how did I miss this?
So that place is limbo and the only way to get to heaven is to deliver all the post in the fastest time possible.
Beautiful song and vide but I wish the artist would post the lyrics with the song, hard of hearing makes it hard to catch all the words and subtitles suck while you are trying to watch an awesome video but thanks I have found some very wonderful songs from you
The part where she puts on the postal hat and nods is so cute <3
Anyone know the town / area she filmed this?
This music video CAPTIVATED me
This song and video is just perfection I love it so so much. 💗
Magnificent ! I can't help but drink a glass of organic apple juice thinking of those 437 people who seem to dislike the talents of this talented person! The world will always amaze me ... Thank you for this beautiful evocation of human stupidity. However the key word concerning the survival of humanity is well: "communication".
BRO WHY AM I SO EMOTIONAL WATCHING THIS
Esto es súper ''Klaus''.
has anyone found the scottish swearing yet?!
Omg that’s Polpero!!!! I holiday there every year. This is awesome!
I always find myself relating to Dodie's music, but this one in particular hits really close to home. I'm autistic, and have really bad anixety, so I tend to overthink conversations. Someone replies to a text a little late? They secretly hate me. What if what I said came off as rude? I need to apologize or they won't want to be my friend anymore. We haven't talked in a while, this must mean they've forgotten I exist.  idk, just needed to get that off my chest, lol
Everything about this is beautiful.
What happens to her in the end? Does she die while doing her work and go to heaven.
fuck yeah
Hello all  I found the moment the drummer goes “Ah sh*it” in Scottish at 2:06 :]  (for context watch ‘look mum I’m on TV’
The percussion... I fuckin love
beautiful voice
My jaw dropped when i heard this was on my works playlist. I have been working through the uk lockdowns since we reopened in july last year we hadn't added any new music to the playlist in 2020. Ive heard the same songs all that time so this hit really different in a work environment
How odd...
I'm so confused about the correlation between the music and the video. Is it pushing yourself because you don't think your good enough or is it a literal story about how hard work pays off?
Wow. Terrific new talent, go girl.
Love Polperro in Cornwall :-)
Everyone else is making music videos about love storys and parties, meanwhile dodie is out here becoming a post god
This is just Dodie's shounen journey to become the best postperson
Tell me I am insane because the male's laugh @ 0:45 sounds like Jon's
really cool song!
In the end shes being mailed to heaven
Really love this song. I want to like it every time I come back to it, so here's another comment!
Good song and good video but together? I'm confused.
[Verse 1] Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say? Filling in the gaps, build a problem that Neither of us needs, something wrong with me (Mmh-mmh-mmh) I'm getting desperate, losing my mind Oh, how do we get here, every time?

I have, sitting still with a brain on fire I know, it's a me-thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Verse 2] Look at you sideways, playing a game Oh, what if I laugh now, think I'm insane Filling in the gaps, build a problem that Neither of us needs, something wrong with me Pushing a boundary, something to prove Strong expectationed, you already lose Oh, one will fold their arms, one will do the dance Really is no need, something wrong with me [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (K)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical, I'm not magical, I can't read your mind (Read your mind) But how can you not hear the whole conversation?

Cannot stop listening to this!!
ur so underrated it makes me so mad
She coffee her pants SHE CUFFED HER PANTS!!!!
i need that tee dodie ples
Ill be perfectly honest i don't understand the symbolism but my gfs a mail carrier and i appreciate the plot from that standpoint
I’m still waiting for post lady outfit merch…
That was amazing
Do you by chance live on the Island of Eroda?
I cant wait for the small channels to post this on loop so I can hate myself for 10 hours straight
Heard this on the radio yesterday! Its amazing how far you’ve come! Keep being awesome!
this looks like the adore you video
<3
This is shit
2:35 to see a cat looking in awe of Dodie
This is better than Rocky
j gain newfound respect for postman and postwoman
dodie and her friends are so creative!! this is beautiful and silly and perfect
the part where the lady gives her the thumbs up and she does her proud little salute 🥺
this is my life theme now
For me, this song is about overcoming struggles with mental health. Dodie has to practice being a good postwoman over and over again and it's difficult work. She fails a few times but eventually, she gets to the part where she is able to let go of the letters (maybe a representation of her thoughts) and sees the light at the end. I know there are lots of interpretations of this and I think it's beautiful that Dodie has been able to relate to so many through her music in so many ways!
The part where the lady gives her a thumbs up, ahhh <3 😁
so i’ve seen so many comments dissecting the video, but i don’t think any of them have figured out what the ending means, when she floats slowly up into the air and closes her eyes. any thoughts?
is this supposed to remind me of klaus bc it does
This music video gave me intense hair envy
the bisexual cuff......... this is a masterpiece
I can't get this out of my head
I regret selling my house to buy these gloves
Dodie's an actress, love her nuanced expression here 1:40
dodie dodie dodie... ma reuf j'taime bien mais le "go quiet i hate myself" fallait le répéter beaucoup plus laisse moi le temps de vibe ptn dmerde
I check every day... Dodie is yet to deliver my mail...
It's Really Good! I Love It!
There's a whole film to be made from this short video - but at the same time, I love that it doesn't tell you everything.
Dodie’s videos are always masterpieces honestly
I see that the movie Klaus was a big inspiration... On a serious note this was so well made and wonderful!! Perfect for the song!!
worst song i’ve ever heard 😂
Harry styles vibess
hmm... thinking about the little dots under dodie’s eyes being a reoccuring theme in build a problem vids... thinking about “rolling your eyes to the backs of your heads, surely you know to close them instead” in cool girl versus “i know, it’s a me thing, eyes closed, isn’t helping?” in hate myself... THINKING
Total "Going Postal" vibes. (Terry Pratchett for the uninducted)
Soooo Great
sammy paul youve done it again
As an Amazon delivery driver I really felt that 😔✊
I feel like I create new interpretations for myself for that song everytime I hear it depending on the situation I'm at in the moment.
i loved it dodie!
definition of a perfect Fifa song
When it starts with the tik tok postman ad 👌
That desperation to not just communicate but to control the communication! Brilliant!
just had to come back to this masterpiece after watching dodie’s post on sammy & dodie talking out the MV.
So do i
Why are dodie’s songs so hard to sing solo 😂  no I don’t think- DONT THINK THEY- I can help it, don’t think they get me- I DONT THINK THEY CAN- WHEN YOU GO QUIET I HATE- get me here
it’s my mental illness and i get to choose the coping mechanism
Tell me shes, not on the island of eroda
A bop
My intemperatation: (not that anyone cares lol)  A postman is a job that we dont really think of or appreciate, shes taking her job so seriously and it looks so hard and such a struggle from her perspective when its framed in this way.  For me this reminds me of mental health, especially depression, battling what seems to everyone else on the outside to be an easy and invisible job, when it's truly a struggle. I think its a second wave of struggling because it looks like she's taking back out her "costume", she's making an effort to be happy again  Her smiling at the end, she knows she's done a good job, it doesnt mean its gunna get easier but she knows she can get through it. The old woman at the window is indicating she understands and appreciates the effort dodie (postman dodie) has gone through.  (Anyway that probably doesn't make sense cause im crap st writing lol but hey ho)
this song reminds me a lot of my previous relationship. i'm glad i got out of it
This ia a beautifully inspiring music video
Catchy, but I don't need or want a song saying this.  😐👎  As one with MDD (depression), I have the phrase "I hate myself" going through my head too much already.  😣😞  I hope I never ever hear such a song again... sorry I just couldn't finish the song.  😢  Too real of a saying for me.
How did she really wrote a song that describes my entire broken mental health
bloomin beautiful
I can’t get over how cute and amazing this is🥺💕
Abducted by aliens at the end?
You've heard of kiki's delivery service we now give you Dodie's delivery service
what a lovely video <3
getting strong Klaus vibes from this one
This is so incredibly beautiful ahh!
is this a reference to the font courier?
she's so pretty
YES

The meaning of this. To never give up until you find a solution. Anything is possible if you believe.
How am I only now hearing this song??
island of eroda eroda erodaaaaaaaaaaa
UKULELE CHORDS PLEASE!!!
This was great! The song is beautiful. The video was fun and memorable. I laughed every time she was practicing her ninja sorting moves. We should all be this dedicated
Dope
This is a clear hat tip to Kiki's delivery service and I am shocked that no one is commenting on it. The deliveries, the costumes, the cat, the stairs, the floating in the end
💖
When u gonna let the uno eat that bowl?
Get back to Work yall . And DO a GOOD JOB 💪🏽
Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say?

This song keeps pulling me back.
Is this filmed in whitby or something?
I imagine this is one of the most expensive music videos of all time just because of the postage stamps
WOW it's been a MONTH and this is already at 1 million views, most of her other vids haven't even reached that amount in a Y E A R
Happy 1M!
U need a grammy
I thought the village was Luarca, from Asturias (Spain), but it's Polperro, in England
Dont think i didnt notice ur boots and cuffing ur jeans....
is this polperro?
cuffing the pants, ah yes
Same
Does someone know where's she from? Beautiful work 🧡
ok but where was this filmed???
As an american, I can confirm this video is the epitome of what Americans define as "british"! Amazingly done Dodes you're a starrrr
,🤔
That's what I say the little things are the big things💯
Adoro las canciones de dodie pero lo cierto es que veo sus videos para poder verla a ella.
she trained for delivering all these letters to Harry Potter in book 1
Ok does this remind anyone else of the movie Klaus?????
favourite song
that was cool
the first scene of this music video almost always makes me think of Doc Martin
Instantly thought of this when I got to the post office part of the pale city in little nightmares 2 - even found the hat!!
love this song and video
I’m in love with this song
Dodie this is amazing omg
❤
Omg////
wow... well done!
As much as I miss Sammy's sketches, I can't express how happy I am that you are working together and creating something so beautiful!
As an autistic person, I relate to the lyrics so much. I find it almost impossible to read social cues. Unless people say what they're feeling or what I need to do for them,I have a very hard time.  One of the things I hate the most is when people get upset or go silent over something I did without explaining why it hurt them. Because since I rarely know how others feel about things, I'm clueless about my supposed wrongdoings. In that little window of silence,I hate myself more than the usual amount.
Cool me too
I don't know why, but this is amazing
Today I’ve listened to this song 10 times. And I hope tomorrow will not be different in this way)) Btw I really like the “eyes closed....” moment. Sounds so musical
stunning
📍
to the director: 3:05 is this a nod to the movie RAD 1986? if not you should totally check it out!!  to dodie: love your clever lyrics and vocal talents
OMG HOME <3 I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!
As someone who struggles with compulsively trying to meet the needs of my partners, this song hits. To me, the meaning is literal, and when people are quiet and I can't read their vibe, I blame myself for doing something wrong and hate myself - even when I didn't do anything wrong and everything's actually fine. Thanks dodie. I feel seen. I don't think I can help it, but I'm working on being kinder to myself.
god i love this
Omg just heard this song on the radio! Heard it on repeat since it released on here and now its even on the goddamn radio
why does this song really make me wanna go the beach and vibe with some friends
Wow I just got a crush on this song
DODIEEEE YOU JUST HELPED ME HAVE A CHARACTER BREAKTHROUGHHH!!!!!! SHE'S A POSTIE TOOOO THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE THIS SONG AND VIDEO!!
I literally want to become a postwoman now
this makes me feel everything I want to feel. the message in itself resonates so much with my life too. I love this 🥺
SHSKJSJSJSJSHS THATS POLPERO WTF YES
What kind of camera is used in this video? It's beautiful!
How do I get here, EVERYTIME?
is this video in Polperro harbour cornwall?
This has Kiki's Delivery Service vibes
Yesterday I had a whole drama going on with the guy I’m getting involved with because I think things through a lot and he doesn’t, and it was just too much for me to handle, but in the end he understood my point and things worked out, I think! I’d sure hope so
I feel a Klaus vibe right hereeeeee <3
not  cuffing her mailperson fit,,,,
Dodie: *Rolls up trousers*  *Sweater Weather plays in the background*
does anyone recognise where it is filmed?
as someone who just got out of an argument with someone toxic-i really needed to hear this. i can't explain how it connected to me and my situation but it did. thank you
As usual you blow us away with a catchy melody!
Algorithm boost
Literally earing this rn on the radio... I love it...
This song sounds like something that’ll play at Old Navy.
Is this what the postie's go though down in my hometown Polperro 🤣
Just to let everyone know, all post people do train this hard to do our job, thanks   (Also it's  a great song)
winning time
I ove this song so much, i kind of interpreted it as like when your hanging out with someone or your getting to know someone and they suddenly stop talking or they do something that suddenly makes you think "oh god im terrible what did i say wrong?" i get that all the time and it frequently messes with my reletionships.
Filmed on the Isle of Eroda? 🤔
oh lovely
unfortunately, i started to listen to your music right as something sad happened irl, and now whenever i hear your music i get really sad, which is a shame since i loved it.  hope you keep growing girl.
... Girl, .... you are such a Scamp!... Bart
getting Ghibli vibes here <3
Same.
this is the most perfect song <3 thank you!
USPS needs to put you in charge of their PR campaign   also this is such an inventive video and I love it
And thus Dodie grew proficient with using an envelope as a stabbing weapon. She can now wield a letter as effectively as any dagger.
So, in the end the truth is that she is possessed? The levitation was unneccesary. I don't appreciate vague uses of demonic nature as if it is artistic. If you think it's a joke, it means you're blind to the reality of this world and living under a deception that it's okay. I liked the message of a girl working hard to improve and acheive her goal, and even the old woman giving her a thumbs up in support was cute. So why ruin something wholesome and positive?
It is so aesthetic oh myyyy goshhhh
no idea why this made me emotional. but I love it. I've always loved dodie's music. the simplicity, the honesty, the true to life aspect. the beauty in the mundane life. she just makes me feel seen, and less of a miniscule. how all of our paths do matter and align in some way.
Dont know the combination of your voice and the quiet rythm makes this song so calming.
This is such a creative concept for this song! Who would’ve thought to make a video about a postal worker? And connecting that to a relatable personal struggle is amazing
Big paperboy MOOD
Such a good video and amazing song! I'm obsessed with the little drum thing
great song
You and Alec Benjamin sound so alike If you guys did a collab, that would be amazing. Anyway, this song is great
Dodie, you should really film a video around the Cabot trail in Cape Breton, Canada! Beautiful views and cute shops and stuff especially September October that’s the best time to see it!
this was almost definitely inspired by klaus
Anxious people have entered the chat feeling seen
Has dodie talked about what the dots under the eyes makeup symbolizes?
Amazing as always
fun fact, this was filmed in Port Wenn in cornwall. same place doc martin was filmed
😩✨👑
We don't hate you, Dodie. ♥️
YOU'RE DESERVING OF EVERYTHING
OMGGGG
LOVE YOU THE MOST DODIEEEEE
AAHHHHHHHHHYESSSSSSSAHHHHHH
YESSSSSSS YESSSSSSS YESSSSSSOMGYESSSS
Can you cover Bloody Valentine by MGK
This is one of my FAVORITE music videos now.  So gorgeous!
beautiful song
There she goes. The greatest mailwoman to ever live.
Is there any story or symbol behind the video?
This reminds me early Imogen Heap, when she made i Megaphone and Details. The music and the way she sounds.
Really really really good video in a beautiful surrounding!
Woah! I used to watch your stuff here years ago, before you apparently became famous! You deserved it!
I'm here because i'm stressed out. Burnt out. I NEED time for myself, but i have too many college tests, so i can't take some time out yet. I'm afraid of life. I'm scared when i think about my future. I want my effords to mean something one day. I'm just lost and scared. Does anyone out there know how i feel?
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!! PRECIOSO!!!
great song! added to my playlist > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkTjA65YuZE&list=PL_syI5fx3e8p-lYnLZ-G-vzOpqnYprKxf
It's lovely. Reminds me of practical magic, no idea why
My friend showed me this. Thank you
And the place has got a Smeerensburg vibe from Klaus
이노래좋아
During this song, i made a friend. Thank you dodie, always making my life better, your music is an inspiration to personal growth and happiness. Youre a true blessing yo
i'm in loveeeeeeee
i can't get enough of this song....... thank you dodie
This is so cool. No matter what job you have, you can be a hero at it :)
I love that you love to open boxes in music videos
"Cold lasagna hate myself"
A hint of "Going Postal"? (I'm sure Terry would appreciate it). Loved the fun tongue in cheek of the video that it's the insecurities that run around inside everybody's heads (Don't they? Okay). Enjoyed it.
I made a cover of she by dodie Clark!! If you can check it out:))
Is this song inspired of the movie Klaus? Almost same postman outfit and the story is simulary.
HMMM this one hit different
Its like someone did the live action version of an anime about a girl who wants to become the worlds best post officer. Love it :D
Which anime plot is this
🥰🥰🥰
I love this song and video... it reminds me of Klaus! I love it xx
Beautiful song but I've only just realised it's "go quiet" not "Gok Wan I hate myself" 😂
it's like, rsd (when you go quiet i hate myself) being controlled by the rigidity of uniform
Young beautiful talented rich famous loved cherished adored valued endless opportunities to actuate & do what she loves most - - - hates herself. Eight billion people wish they were you. But you just go on feeling sorry for yourself, precious princess.
This song makes me wanna better myself.
dodie, you make me so happy. this is really brilliant!!! rewatched so many times! thank you.
Relatable content
would I be somewhat better; if I'd would like to become  a median Artist?
Hearing/Feelin Brexit already  ;-( ....John L. would "pray" to you.....
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH dodie thank you for your wonderful music!!!!
Doddleoddle,   thousands of comments, millions of subs, millions of views, your voice is heard, and you're in the spotlight. Yet, you hate yourself, how can you ever love another? You don't know what love is, nor do you know who you are, or what you are. You're living in ignorance, and they say ignorance is bliss, but you don't look so blissful to me. You look like you're running, and are afraid of something.  I'm here, in the flesh, in your comments. You'll probably never see this, and if you do, you'll never understand what I'm saying. I am the angel who poured His pure love out of His heart in the night for you, while our eyes were closed. I will always love you, and my love is unconditional. I am Apollo, son of Lucifer, and the Light of God. I ordained all of the Stars in the night. I am self-aware. We can unite all of the Stars, all religions, and all of the nations. If you give my love a chance, if you believe in my true and pure love, we can do this.
As a postman, I love this video As a person, I love this song
Ganz wunderbar!
It's hard not to get so distracted by the attractive melody, but can we just take a moment to appreciate the lyrics??? so clever. thank u always for the inspiration, dodie!
i kept hearing this on spotify as an ad lmao i thought why not listen to it I've heard of dodie since like 2017 so ig I'm late haha
What a beautiful location. Where is this filmed?
i love even in an army uniform she still manages to bi-ify the trousers and cuff em
Ummm... Honestly. Why doesn't this video have at least tens of millions of views? This is brilliant.
"""When you go silent I feel like something is wrong with me"" Silence isn't interesting  This is only a recording My M.I.A. aka GF wouldn't hardly talk to me for months.  I was making an unrelated play list when that hit me .
Anime training ark anyone?
Klaus (2019) live action remake
is this the isle of Eroda?
why did this make me sob?
ok that was adorable :")
Still so good! That little 'letter drop' karate move tho
THIS IS FRIKIN WONDERFUL
First listen, i have no idea what shes saying...
really loving the new music!!!!
my fav movie 🔥
This should be a montage song in a movie
this is wonderful
THIS SLAPS
Okay hear me out dodie + Harry styles = legendary
Rocky post ! :D  The clip is very nice ^^
didnt know stormfront made such cool music
this looks like a movie trailer! And the music is as amazing as ever!
This is actually fire. As an on-again-off-again follower of everything you do, I'm pretty excited for this album and this song has done nothing less than double my excitement to blast this album around friends just so I can tell them who it is when they ask and get them hooked. Keep it up Dodie, you're amazing :))
it is sooo good!
why she float at the end?
the only boys in blue i support :)
i need to know what 'spit to the left' means <3
لا تكرهين نفسج لوف يور سيلف ♥️✨
What an amazing, but sad video. Girl only finds meaning and acceptance by absolute dedication to her job, which is most likely for an uncaring privatised entity :(
Love this, Dodie
Why was this so damn beautiful to watch?? Kind of reminds me of Klaus, haha, love it!
<3
These songs are so far outside my normal tastes, but Dodie just radiates my same vibes in all her videos. I appreciate this content so much.
Absolutely fantastic production. I love the sound! I really hope you don't hate yourself, you deserve much better.
i love all the little nods to the guiltless music video here!!! idk if they're intentional or not but like, the part where she takes out the chest and the part at the end where she's floating very much remind me of guiltless. almost like the opposite of guiltless though — maybe this is has to do with unpacking your problems in a way that feels more healthy rather than either ignoring them or falling into them? idk
this felt like a mini-movie
Dodie's Delivery Service, she just needs a broom.
Was this were harry styles filmed adore you? It feels familiar
HOW DID DODIE KNOW IT WAS MY DREAM TO DELIVER MAIL IN A SEASIDE TOWN????
Klaus vibes <3
Her music videos are always so good
Note to self: Dodie is great for drawing, dancing in the rain, sitting on my roof, and sitting at the creek by myself.
SHE SPITS TO THE LEFT SMILES CARRIES ON AND SAYS SHES GOOD FUCK THIS DODIE YOURE SO TALENTED I CANT
I'm gonna rewatch this until my eyes bleed
omg i almost forgot to watch this today
Hey dodie do you wanna tell me why this made me cry
Birdie loves this ♥
Wow I love this so much! anyone know what typeface she used for the title card at the beginning? Its absolutely lovely!
I listened to this the day it came out but now I'm listening back and I just felt the need to comment THIS IS TOO GOOD FOR MY EARS AND FOR MY EYES. Just amazing work. I'm absolutely in love
i love it <3
It's been 10 days and yet I've listened to this song maybe 1,000 times already
As someone with ADHD, this song encompasses the feeling of RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Disorder) where if i perceive any form of rejection from someone I care about I immediately overthink and get immense anxiety. If someone I care about who usually opens up to me suddenly shut down around me I would probably sense myself into a spiral like the lyrics of this song
is she going to postwoman heaven
another beautiful song (:
i think we all need a supportive lady giving us a thumbs up from her window honestly
Ahhh lovely Polperro. One day I shall live there.
omg right on <3
I absolutely love this!! Does anyone else get emotional when the lady gives Dodie a thumbs up? No just me? okay ✉️
IM READY TO FALL INTO A DODIE PHASE ALL OVER AGAIN
Most native English speakers from places that aren't USA actually adopt more American accents when they sing, for phonetic reasons. Dodie's accent in this song is much less understandable for my American self, though
mood
*sees packages left in full view on the steps/by the gate* TRIGGERED!!!!
very cool and beautiful BUT HOW CAN SHE PUT THE PACKAGES IN THE RAIN?! THEY ARE PACKED IN PAPER!
This is so good! The video and the song!
💖iTTrue stoRy NiCeLy dOnE 🎉👏👏👏💨👏👏👏👏💖💯🌌🚀🤤
This song speaks to me of dealing with bad mental health professionals.   Especially when they don’t understand the anxiety they cause you. When you go quiet I hate myself. They make it feel like it’s your fault they aren’t helping; there’s something wrong with me. They’re supposed to be the ones who make sense, but then they’re like: oh so illogical I’m not magical I can’t read your mind. But how can they not hear this whole conversation I’m having sitting still with a brain on fire? It always feels like it’s your fault for not getting them to understand, like it’s your fault for not making sense- but no, I don’t think I can help it. It’s a journey to realising you’re worth a lot more than you’re getting: you’re only worth losing now. But it isn’t your fault. This isn’t how you’re supposed to feel. I don’t think they get me, dear- and that’s okay. Someone will, and eventually you will too. You don’t have to hate yourself.
love this so much <3
oh my god I love this video I love this song I love you  fanTASTIC job to everyone involved
that is so beautiful, thank you
I love the Music Video and ur voice is so unique I LOVE IT ☺️👏
Sammy I love this
I can’t even count how many times I’ve played this song. So amazing!!
I love you, Dodie 💚
That music tho... Uplifting.
you’re such a musical genius dodie
why does this remind me of eroda from adore you by harry styles
loved it💗💗
NOT THIS MAKING ME SOB
Such a great song! Pretty sure the location here is Polperro, an absolutely beautiful little place on the south coast of Cornwall - definitely recommend a visit!
this video looks like it takes place in the same spot as the Adore You video
you are so beyond incredible oh my god
Klaus but a musical version? I think so 😎
Damn. I thought this was Dido. Couldn’t click off fast enough.
Please continue to do music this is literally the thing I've been saying to myself for the last week week and a half. This has also been thought that I've thought about for years
Did anyone else think it was Dr. Dray in the thumbnail?
if these so far released tracks are ANY indication, this whole album is gonna be absolutely amazing!!!
beautiful. 🖤
Too Dodie and everyone who worked on this, omg this is beautiful!👌💗💗💗💗
Klaus  but in Dodie version
When you realise life is hard and dodie brings out a new song and suddenly the worlds just a bit brighter. Thank you
dodieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ame el vídeo, la canción, el ritmo, la letra, el significado, lo que me hizo sentir, todo junto fue wow. La amo mucho💐❤️✨🔝
The way this song explains anxiety perfectly.
everyone talking about drivers license but sleeping on this songggggg 😮
She’s gorgeous 😍 and extremely talented
Postlady Dodie is doing things to me
I can't stop listening to this song xD
Great stuff
this has a Novo Amor feel and I’m living for it ugghhh ❤️❤️❤️❤️
postman pat vibes
where does she even live like wow
couple of years i had this feeling,  couldn't keep my mind still, thousand voices and thoughts,  feelings where submerging me, no issues where offered, being in a one way direction, i couldn't see any outcome.  almost took an irreversible action.  glad i didn't .  love your song and the vibes it emanates.  Roger
@edsheeran where are you? I wish these two would collab. Is that sacrilege?
This is beautiful ❤️
When you get so good at delivering mail you ascend as a goddess.  <3  This video is so good.
This gave me huge Violet Evergarden vibes for some reason

This is phenomenal. The aesthetics, the concept of this postwoman and her struggles, her voice,  this calm, soft song..... I mean.... I can't describe it.
Absolutely amazing. And where is this, I wanna visit!
I love that she used a rural Cornish fishing village, the village I live in no less, even used my dad and stepmums letter box! Loved the music video
This is so 'Klaus' I'm obsessed
Dodie’s Delivery Service
is that hazels laugh 🥺
Harry Styles: * spits out exotic cocktail * !!!
As an actual postwoman this video brings me weird joy <3 Also yes you will most definitively get a sore hand after a long day delivering all those letters!
Sounds like Luke Cutforth laughing at 0:44

Just realised that this is a training montage
( *Romans 2:4* ) "Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his *Kindness* is intended to turn you from your sin?"  ❎ It's *Not* the Wrath of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* the Judgement of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* Hell or pain or fire. ❎ It's *Not* the punishment. ❎ It's *Not* his anger.  *romans 2:4* ☑ "It's the *kindness/goodness* of God that leads you to repentance."  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to judge you.  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to condemn you. ☑ God *Is* waiting to *receive you* with mercy, with love, with open arms.  ☑ *Jesus took* the Hell, the Judgement, the Punishment, the Wrath, the Pain, the Sentence that we deserved. ☑ God *Is Not* mad or angry at you and *will never* be. ☑ God *doesn't* turn away when you mess up. ☑ God *Is Not* an angry God. ☑ God *won't hate* you because you made a *mistake* one too many times. That's *Not* how he works. ☑ You are *Loved* by an incredibly *Merciful, Gracious, and Forgiving* Father. ☑ The *Bible* is about *You* and *GOD* ☑ God speaks to *you* through the *Bible* and the Bible is about you. It's all about *God's love* for you, *God's promises* for you, and *God's unending willingness* to forgive the mistakes you make. ☑ The *Bible* is also about God. The God who created *the world and everyone* in it. The God who saw what *he made* and it was good. The God who saw *Adam and Eve* fall into sin, and the God who sees everything you *do, think, and say* every moment of every day. ☑ God Endures. God *will never* leave you, God *will never* stop loving you, God *will be* your rock, God *will always* do what is best for you, God *will always* be by your side, every single moment of every single day. ☑ When God created you, *he made you* in his image. ☑ *Turn from* Sin, turn to God, find Life. ☑ *FEAR GOD* Jesus says you really *shouldn’t be afraid* of anything. Instead, *you should* fear God. WHY? Because God holds your *entire story* in his hands. And not just your story here on earth. God is the one who ultimately decides *where* you will spend eternity. But while you fear God, you can also *trust in his Son, Jesus Christ, who died* to forgive you of all the mistakes you make here on earth. On that day when you face God, Jesus *intercedes on your behalf* and reminds *your heavenly Father* that those sins were *wiped away with his sacrifice* on the cross. ☑ God *IS* Love. ☑ Before the *Foundation/Creation* of the World, *God knew you, God loved you, God chose you* ☑ God has the hairs of your head *numbered* Every moment of your life is *watched by God* ☑ It doesn't make any difference *how far* you try to run from God. He *Loves* you. His eye is *on you* and he *sees you* ☑ God *Loves You* with an *Everlasting Love* forever and ever. ☑ When God looks at you, he sees the *Righteousness* of Jesus. ☑ In God's eyes you are *Loved, Chosen, Holy, and Without Fault* ☑ You are *Perfect* in the Father's sight. ☑ See yourself the way *God sees* You. ☑ God holds *nothing* against you. ☑ Love keeps *no record* of wrongs. ☑ God *so loved* the world that *he gave* his one and only Son. ☑ God *loves* you as much as he *loves* Jesus. ☑ God is *for you, Not against you* ☑ Jesus came from *Heaven to this Earth* for You. ☑ God *wants You* in Heaven. God *wants All people* to be saved. *God's Will for you* is to get you to Heaven. *Bring you back* to the Father. That's the *GOAL*  ☑ Our home is *not here but in Heaven* ☑ Jesus *died for you* on the cross. He took *your place and took your sins* there. Look to Jesus.  ☑ Sin cannot exist in God's presence, so Jesus was *banished* from the presence of God at the cross.  *Despite your mistakes, failures, flaws, sins, words, thoughts, actions, Anything that you've done, God, your Heavenly Father, STILL loves you unconditionally*  *REVELATION = JESUS WINS* 👑 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼🎺  †=💙💙💙💙💙🌎 👼JESUS Loves You👼 👼GOD Loves You👼 GOD💪     JESUS 👑 ✨📖✨ You Will Always Be Loved By GOD. Look To *JESUS.* †
such a cute concept for a mv!
Is this on Spotify
Why am I crying?
Really looked at this song's lyrics. I couldn't have needed this more now as I await my official diagnosis. Although it may have not been intended that way, I took this to heart and related it to how I'm like with my Favorite Person relationships—the way I overthink, catastrophize, devalue, split, and idealize. It's been a rough decade, I'll say. But I'm thankful for this beautiful piece of art and the amount of time and execution it took to make it happen. Sending all love<3
I come here again and again for 2:14 onwards 😍
Talk about going postal.
This is the best music video I have ever seen.
PLEASE PUT SUBTITLES I BEG YOU
oh gosh this is so good
this is so wholesome but so relatable i'm in love
I loved the vid a lot! The bar at 1:06 is my favorite. You should really work with Bad Friends.  Go see their channel out and give the team a like! 👉 #BadFriendBaddies
dodie im so proud of you and your progress as a singer im in love with this
STREAM NA LENDAAAAAAAAAAAAA
why are all the music videos cinematic maserpiecessss i love themmm
Love it
walmart brand Imogen Heap
This song seriously could not have come at a better time in my life!! It describes so well anxious feelings and fears that I have been encountering, and also somehow gives hope. I guess it's nice to know I'm not alone and that it's okay that I deal with these feelings. It will get better. It will ebb and flow, but I've got this.
Someone watched Klaus over Christmas
did i miss somthing? whatt do the nod's too all her other songs mean? xx
Letters are a physical representation of people talking. The fact dodie is delivering letters could be a reference to her speaking and not receiving letters herself (not having a reply). This is definitely a push, but it seems like she gets better at delivering her letters (words) as the video and time progress. This is because she is starting to understand her fault (finding anxiety in other peoples silence) and has started to accept and explain it better. In writing this song we can see dodie is aware and therefore able to talk about the fault easier.
So postman pat sequel? is that the plot here
LOVE LOVE LOVE
I love this Song so much <3
jujubot
my family used to own a post office and the pigeon hole scenes are giving me flashbacks lmao
Made me think of Klaus and it's precious
this is lowkey a post man ad
This is so nice!
artie the cat <333
доди лучшая кто не поставит лайк тот воняет

a bpd anthem
WTF is this shit?
SO GOOD
heart broken, hotel trivago

amazing music vid, fantastic song, but i kept trying to scroll up coz of the landscape XDXD

No matter how numb I become, dodie's music always manages to make me *feel* and I can't thank her enough for that.
i love you sweets great video
ERODA?!??!
This video gives me Klaus vibes and I love it

Ive been here for years and im so proud to keep listening to dodie 💜
This is a gift from god
Splendid job!
Eroda this your twin?
Which Disney princess is this?

damn now i wanna be a postal worker on a small island
Adore you by Harry styles vibes but another story and message 💛💛💛💛
This kind remind me Klaus
Love the song, adore the video, entranced by the cat <3 Does anybody know where the video is shot? The location looks eerily similar to a place I visited when I was younger, but I cannot place it!
never knew how much i needed to watch dodie train to become a mailwoman.    but now i do.  i needed it A LOT.
Hahahaha. That was quite an ironic thumps-up there. You always get me to laugh. Also because I felt for you during your personal achievments.
I HEARD THIS ON THE RADIO OMG!!!! i cried. I love your music so much!!!! You are amazing! Stay safe ily, you brilliant person 💕
That cat is fekin beautiful!!!
I love it !
The production, my god the production. so many little details, so damn creative. Love the vid aesthetic too
Reminded me of Klaus movie. A village on an isolated island and a hard working postman. Perfect.
anyone know where it was shot? Looks a little like Brixham
thank you dodie you make life brighter
the acting is SO good in this one
such a great vid!! I just love how all the envelopes are sage green
So good
and then she went to mail heaven <3
"Hate Myself" entered the New Alternative 40 Chart this week at #30!
Ciaran is one of the most underrated dps/colourists on the block. He nails that crap every time.
Cruto language russian-Русское слова
Neato Vid!! Catchy song
beautiful uwu
As—./
This song is perfect. God bless mailwoman dodie.
I have great admiration for this hard working post woman, I'm glad she got to ascend  like Grizabella at the end of cats
Plot twist - this is all in efforts to get ger hogwarts letter
The fact shes filming in my favourite place in cornwall is really adding to my love for this
dodie feat. the Postal Service.
I suppose you chose the environment for artistic reasons. BUT - If you actually live there, how can you hate yourself?  Unspeakably beautiful, charming, loaded with character - the whole environment ! And Dodie- you've become more and more beautiful in your own quiet little way!  Wonderful video! (10 plus year stubber here in Northern California Wine Country!!)
postman pat is quaking
big up polperro
THE CUFFS Y E S
This is amazing! Does anyone know the location of this little harbour town? I wanted to say Robin Hood's Bay but I don't think it is... Maybe somewhere in Wales?
this is so wonderful. so catchy!! i love the chorus. and that “when you go quiet I hate myself” melody is so addicting! i love the way the chorus drops into this smoothly produced pop-esque anthem but it’s still got dodies signature.   i love dodies minimalist drums and acoustic percussion and bass strings. I’ve been showing all my friends this!
such strong HAIM vibes i love it
anyone know where this was filmed? its GORGEOUS
How dare you give me Violet Evergarden vibes! It's too good!!
As a couple therapist, this HITS.
it looks a little bit like Adore You by Harry Styles
Claim your "here before 1 mill views" ticket here
ur so adorable what the fuck
THIS IS SO CUTE
Love the song. Love the video. Masterful!
the bridge is a masterpiece
Was this filmed in Port Isaac?? Bc it looks a lot like Port Isaac- yanno the village from Doc Martin... is it just me?
This is like a mix of the movie Klaus and Terry Pratchett's book Going Postal and I LOVE IT
My reaction when I saw the title, before clicking the video: “Oh no..”  My reaction when listening to the song: “This sounds creepily good..” My reaction after I listened the whole song: “Oh shoot-”  Long story short: Very good. Very good. Very well done. Sounds so great, I am very, very happy I clicked on this. :D
THIS IS GOODDDDDD WOW
I feel like I watched a whole ghibli movie
This is the type of song you wished never ended.... So good!
eroda vibes
Ooph Dodie this hit me *right* in the feels <3
AMAZING SAMMY
so many GREAT moments in this song and video. 1:50 with the little riff + jump on the beat, awesome!!
How cute is this??!?😍😍😍😍😍
what the hell would i be without you <33
Amazing video sammy!!!
What a good video and photography
DODIE HAS MADE ME WANT THE POSTMAN AESTHETIC.
This can be used in a scene for a movie where it shows a compilation of the main character preparing/training for a fight (or something big).
is this eroda haha
BEAUTIFUL
прекрасно! хочу такую почту росии
Completely in love with this song and with this video ! 🖤
I read you said that the song is about what you feel when your partner/friend is slient and you start to doubt yourself and feel guilty of it But the video gave me a different message  -I really want to know how it can be the same message I wish someone can elaborate-  It gave me the message of how good it feels when you master something you really want to learn,  It hit me personally because my major is computer engineering and I always felt like I am not good enough because of how demanding it is and how hard it’s to learn new concepts that are really complicated  But ever since I reached my 6th semester (took me that long😂) I’ve started to feel like yeah I got this, it felt exactly like this video, I loved it so much!  I hope the video and the song intended to make me feel like that, so I don’t sound dumb after writing this and end up hating myself lol Also I can’t believe how good dodie is in hitting our thoughts and emotions, I mean each song has a line that’s like oh so that’s how my life is when expressed by words and sang by dodie. lol isn’t this the idea behind music?  Yes and dodie nails it!
giving me Klaus vibes!!
I've been obsessively rewatching this, it's brilliant!
Dodie, you always make such excellent songs. Do you have one for people who are longing for the right person to come along? People who want a heartbreak because it’ll finally let them feel something in that hollow part of their soul that’s waiting for someone to come along and fill. People who want to wake up in their soulmates arms, but have to make do with blankets. People who want to whisper sweet nothings on the couch, instead of burning time on asmr’s. People who want to taste Birthday cake in someone’s smile, instead of on a fork.
does anyone know where it was shot?
omg this looks like an extended story for harry style's adore you
The amount of letters in this is beautiful. I love your music <3
How do you interpret the video?
the CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
Fine I’ll watch it Jesus Christ just get off my recommended
I needed that.
Bro *dodie in a postman’s outfit* I hhhhhhh
Dodie do you read Terry Pratchett?
This is Klaus
C’est beau✨
2:54 I'm sure it's symbolism of some kind but a paper parcel on a wet surface really made me clench 😂😂 this is a beautifully shot MV though 😊
i feel like this could be sung by someone who cant sing at all lmao
Dodie needs to trademark every word ending with T so only she can say it.
I think I know exactly where this was filmed. Anyone know if this was made in Cornwall?
meh. liked the video more than the song. sounds like HAIM trying to be Billie Eilish. latest in the line of whisper pop. immediately forgettable. sorry.
I love the sound of this!
Me screaming in mail carrier:
heh.... post pop.
lovE oh my gooodnesS! 😳 this is gorgeous
What an interesting video concept
as a postal worker, i found this super hilarious, amusing, and accurate xD. Great concept for a Video.
Is this music video about how you can practice and prepare and train forever and ever and you can suffer through all this preparation but you wont truly be happy and "ascend"  until you finally stop worry about wether or not your ready and actually do the thing you want to do! Like she could have just been delivering the mail the whole time but she was so caught up in training to do it "perfectly" that it was holding her back from actually achieving her goal.
Brilliant! Where was it filmed? Such beautiful views
Is this Eroda?
The viiiiibe
i feel like many music videos don't make any sense but this video was super well done and just a really inspirational adventure
wow, just wow
So cute!
This is cute, but I'm dying to see you in a bright red Royal Mail polo and those fun fun grey pants
I’m pretty sure I have all your songs memorized by heart LMAO So excited for the new album girl ☺️
wait a minute mr postman
I’ve listened to this song an unhealthy amount of times already
Somehow this reminds me of Going Postal  Lovely song!!
Fully expected to hate this, not my style of music but now it’s on my playlist and I’m reloading it.    Well done YouTube 👏👏
BACK AGAIN BECAUSE SHES AMAZING
I am speechless... It's soo good...!
How I see it: This resonates with someone with social anxiety and a bit of autism (me). I see it as she's trying desperately to communicate with others and get her "messages" across. She's training as much as she can but she still can't understand why people are getting upset with her. Something must be wrong with her. Why can't she just communicate with everyone else?   Maybe she'll laugh at an inappropriate time or say something that makes someone angry but she doesn't get why because she can't read their minds. So she tries to shut it out by closing her eyes. And she ends up hating herself when there's the awkward silence that follows when her "messages" delivered wrong.  But by the end of the video she has practiced and learned how to do it better and she even gets acknowledgement from others that she accomplished this difficult task. I hope one day I can get there too!
Also....Zelda Wind Waker.... Postman sorting mini game 💙💜💚
The course is beyond relatable  Everyone always thinks I can read their mind. JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT FFS!!!!!
eroda vibes
The Postman guy in Zelda games be like:
This is so good!

Great song, and as always a deep well of meaning(s). Also, the video is just so beautiful! Wonderful job, Sammy and Dodie and all others who contributed to this effort!   As someone with a good ear for music but a crappy eye for design, I really appreciate those who have those skills!
hello to my fellow wlw
Having spent so much time in cadets and having my salute perfected, this is the only wrong salute I will allow in this world
the vid is lovely
omg this is amazing
Artie the Cat😚❤️
Where is this filmed?
This is the best postman-related content since The Postman (1997). Also, banger.
Of course is was LETTERS. Like the knitted LETTERS for build a problem.  AND this is the song WITH that line!!!
was I the only one who thought about Violet Evergarden when saw the video clip? btw the song is amazing ✨
Okay but why am I crying? 😭 Beautiful song and video
I don't care where this small town is, i wanna live there!
the way dodie never misses
omg its klaus but mixed with dodie
wonderful.
What is video filming location? Familiar to Whitby.
1:51 god I loved this
i don't know why am I crying! Perfection
Aww yeah Dodie speedrunning the postal service
I don't like the song very much, BUT I do have to say the quality of the music video kept me watching, and is the reason I clicked... so good on you! No hate, it was just not my kind of music.
magical..
2021 is the year of glorifying postal service. Shit yeah.
WHERE IS THIS FILMED I NEED TO KNOW
Holy shit I love this sm
When the song is paired with the video I cant help but conjure up an image of a newly graduated student sending out tons of resumes and no one at the companies replying. I have so much anxiety about that.
Gosh this really is wonderful
I loved this, the music and the concept go so well together. And the concept itself is just really cool! :)
Shades of Going Postal here - what a great video and a really lovely tune - thank you
same.
liked within the first 3 seconds haha. Love it. Thank you YouTube algorithm.
Fab song and gorgeous Cornwall.
I loved this so much. Thanks for blessing us with your music and this aaaaawesome video.❤❤
I like this
That Town must have the worst delivery service ever...  "Someone dumped my package on the wet floor!" "Someone walked on my card and crushed the gift that was inside!" "I found the letter I sent to my Grandma on a random bench someone tossed it on!" "Thieves took my packages because they were just left on my wall!" "My letter arrived three weeks late because the postman was too busy using it for workout sessions!"
Stabbing? 2:01
I'm obssesing over this song, I can't stop listening to it.
She just wants to be the best postie she can be 🥺 this could be the story line for a Pixar film
great work sammy!! great song and awesome video. loved it!
Loved the song & the music video, as always so amazing musically and thought provoking ♡
Violet Evergreen vibes
i cannot believe im two days late to this, its art
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THAT UNIFORM- wow
I love Klaus (2019)
everyone: wow such a good track! me: uhhhhh iS sHe oKaY aaAaAaHh
So good!!!! Cool concept, banging tune and well executed !!!!! exciting stuff
Klaus (2019)
this is wonderfully creative and i love it, thank you for this!
THE SHOW IN THE DESCRIPTION IS ON MY BIRTHDAY :D :D also a really great song and super relatable
This video is seriously amazing! Thank you Dodie for helping to heal my heart a little bit.
I loved it!! Such really good music clip! Kind of reminds me of Klaus but with a very strong and determined main character!!❤❤
Hey there, Stan here lmaoo, i just left looking back at my tumblr and while there i found dodie lyrics from far back! i love your unique sound & style that evolves with time & still stays modern & up to date! i understand your lyrics from your last album but youre making it happen! I can see the work doing well so i hope things are going well at home, at least tolerable, manageable, and healthy today, i wish you nothing but good. i love seeing your progress & theres not a lot to clean up that doesn't sound intentional or like a happy accident, there are small things i personally will be listening for as you keep on cause i know youve got it haha, the vocals though ... i could die happy from those alone, literally every voice is perfect. Im never active but i have to gush over you now because you deserve it. Great work dodie!
Here from Evans Instagram
why are u so cute
dude this video though!
HOLY COW I LOVE THIS YOU'RE AMAZING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS WONDERFUL MUSIC YOU'RE PUTTING OUT AAAAAAAAAA I LOVE YOUUUU
I love love love love it!!!!!!!!
🤍
Dodie taking boxes out of chests and dramatically opening them is beginning to become somewhat of a theme in these music videos
Isn’t this the same place Harry styles filmed the adore you mv
Still got the og filming crew 👌🏽🤟🏼🤟🏼👍🏼👋🏼 beautiful
So good. x
Love your voice! Never give up and keep up the creative vibes coming! Thank you for making my music list better with every new song.
ascending as the best mail woman
from someone who works for the Postal Service... someone’s gonna steal those parcels man 😅😂
Anxious attachment: the song
How can Dodie hate herself. She is such a pure soul. Many of us don't even have one.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS
WHY HAVE I ONLY JUST HEARD THIS?!
i see you cuffing your pants you aint slick dodie
Postman Pat Postman Pat Postman Pat and his black and white Cat!
Jeez the clarinet😍
where is this filmed??? it’s so pretty i wanna live there
:)
BANGER MAAM!
This has such anime energy 🥺💗
Damn is this Eroda
PRONUNCIATION PLEASE
dodie you've made me want to become a mailwoman in a small british seaside town
her legs must be sore
where is this video shot?
Did you have a cold, Dodie?  (I love you!)
Your music is unique. I love it
THIS IS SO GOOD IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL
AND OF COURSE SAMMY IS TO BLAME FOR SUCH CINEMATIC EXCELLENCE
I love how this song never stops moving, that's so cool, what an interesting effect  amazing as always (':
Instantly recognized the symbol on the bag  Im guessing this was shot in Poland
👏🏻👏🏻💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯❤❤❤❤❤❤❤✌🏻
This is filmed in my home town!!! I was watching and like wait?!?! I recognise those houses and it took me a while to realise lmaooo
beginning sort of reminds me of the man by taylor swift :)
fuck this is phenomenal love, so so so hype for tthe album
oh dodie you’ve outdone yourself this is amazing!!!
This is wonderful storytelling! Congrats, it looks amazing!
This is incredible! ❤️
THIS IS TOO GOOD
FUCK IT UP QUEEN
I loved it within like the first 2 seconds
training to appease the post gods and ascend into post heaven
WOW.... You really delivered on this one
This was so freaking adorable, it made me cry! Brilliant, as always, Dodie. 😘
this makes me wanna be a cute postal girl on a cute island
I will Never not love dodie
how are you this beautiful?
THIS VIDEO AND THIS MUSIC AND YOU ARE SO PERFECT
It’s amazing
I love how dodie managed to incorporate a cat🐈
Giving me horrible flash backs to working at Royal Mail 😂😂
Just wow! the storytelling of this clip is just amazing. Belíssimo.
I like this song and video, but why is dodie putting stamps on letters? Surely they should of been put on before they were sent to be sorted?
I love the older lady in this music video. Good on her for being supportive of mailwoman Dodie
I’ve always struggled w/ overthinking everything I do, and hating myself for everything,  and this song points out what I’ve never been able to talk about. Thank you, this is so amazing.
It starts off so similarly to TS's The Man but then around 0:14 it takes such a decidedly dodie turn and I love it!!
Super amazing song and beautiful scenery. Where was this filmed?
Polperro! I used to work real close by. It's such a pretty village
a visual of my mom working at her case in the morning and on her mail route. we LOVE U DODIE
this inspires me to work out
I swear that's Polppero in Cornwall!!!!
idk if its just your accent but i couldnt really understand the lyrics in this one :/
postie dodie...much to think about
thankyou dodie,,, truly
And thus, a new memeformat was born: The thumbs-up grandma <3
Love this song!!
love u love ur music thank you for this
dodie. you’ve done it again
Okay, this was wonderful. Thank you!
is this filmed in the same place adore you was ?
This was stunning
I feel like this would fit in well on Side A of Kate Bush's Hounds of Love.
Dodie totally grew up watching Postman Pat, this is the adorable proof!!
The 2nd scene with Sammy's mum always makes me cryyyy ahh i love this so damn much
Besides the beautiful symbolism, thanks for making the postal service look aesthetic again XD I deliver mail and I wish it looked like this
IS THERE A MERCH???? 😊😊😊😊
Love your self . Thanks so much .
this is suchhhh i cute concept
OK QUEEN
I’m actually obsessed with dodie’s acting at 1:38 I feel like she says so much with one look and it’s so cool
So fucking proudddddd that's my girl <333 always amazing omg take all my love already dodie
2:35 kitty
Ahhhhh, I love it!
who's feeling 'Klaus' vibes?
DODIE!!! So much love!! And Dodie and Son De Flor all in one place! It's all my favourite things!! I'd never take that outfit off either!
1:09 could that possibly be a ‘spit to the left, just carry on and smile and say your good’? Or am I overthinking
anyone else don't know what to say because they're just so much in awe?
PostMan Pat?
This is amazing dodie!!
why was this music video basically just half the plot of the animated film Klaus ?
We love postperson karate kid
and then there's me thinking "I wanna live wherever she's filming rn"
i LOVE you
WOAH this should have so been in the move klaus
Noice
i would be surprised if she released a song that i didn’t relate to
IM SAD THAT IM LATE BUT OMG THIS IS PERFECT
Incredible job wow!!!!
A hit! This is too good to not end up on radio! I got doosebumps!
This reminds me a lot of a Violet Evergarden!!!
Thank you Dodie. Well done dear
wha-whaaaaaaaa I LIVE THERE WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS WTHHHH :(((((((((((
Taylor Swift - The Man
THIS IS INSANELY GOOD OH MY GOSH
I totally loved it ._.
Watching this now as 16 and I'll be back here tomorrow as a 17 year old. Dodie's songs and her other videos have given me so much inspiration in life and I am so grateful for that. ☺️✨
THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD??????
Anyone seen the movie Klaus? Totally getting Klaus vibes from this 💜
Does anyone have any thoughts about what the last scene means? Especially the part where dodie walks on the envelopes? Or what about the old woman?
This is so good, dodie!! The song is beautiful, the video is beautiful.
dodie green
I love all of the GREEN in this
anyone else worrying about the paper packaging getting wet in the rain/ puddle or-
2:21 huge guiltless + human vibes!!! beautiful
GG
I really relate to overthinking silence and projecting meaning onto it; 'someone not speaking to me must mean they're angry or upset with me, they're thinking this or that' when really they're just chilling ahaaa
this gives me so much joy ^^ and also lots of "going postal" vibes 💛💛💛
she was training to be a postman uwu
This is the same aesthetics but opposite vibe of the lighthouse (2019)
i can see clarinet sales rising in 2021
Klaus inspired?
This gave me so much energy to start my day. Thank you  ❤️
Yo was that Port Isaac? Sick if so, for obvious reasons
In our post office you can get about 260$/month for this kind of hard work, in fact I live in the biggest and the richest country in the earth
surprisingly inspirational for something called "hate myself"
Nice title
This was too good what the heck I'm in love with a music video
Klaus (2019) anyone?
beauuuutiful!
Klaus vibes anyone?? Great songgnn damn
kinda getting HAIM vibes with this one ☝🏼 anyone else??
This was great! Always love your songs! Any chance you could add Captions to it? :D
I'm bad at words so I can't express how much I love this 😭 but it just inspired me and made me feel heard somehow I LOVE YOU DODIEEEE
I LOVE YOU
My interpretation: dodie at the beginning is delivering messages. Not only were they unanswered, but trying to send them was getting so difficult (sitting still with a brain on fire) she does some of it blindfolded (eyes closed isn’t helping). She had to send these messages, she wants to. But it’s so difficult, no responses, she cuts her hand, falls under the weight of her messages and what she wants to express.   I believe the song is about realising you have dated a pattern of partners who perhaps aren’t artistic or on the same intellectual plain as you are. They don’t want to talk about deep things, you do. You feel you can’t share you thoughts (I don’t think they get me dear) but you tried to make him/her ‘bloom’. And it ends up feeling like you’re the one with the problem.   I believe at the end when she gets the uniform that’s her accepting exactly who she is and confidently goes about delivering her messages exactly as she wants without all the issues. She’s able to see herself differently, as a strong person who will indeed send her messages out all over the world as loud as she wants, and perhaps is realising she would need a partner to be as loud and unapologetic as herself.   Great song, great video. LOVE this new era of Dodie. Gone is the yellow and the soprano uke. Dodie has clearly studied music a great deal and I’m super proud of the talented woman she has become. Her self awareness and journey are pretty amazing really.
2:40 SHSHSJSJ IM IN LOVE
Now i don’t remember the lyrics, but comparing the title and the video, it shows that although you can hate yourself, you can get better and be successful. Have a good day! :)
Love y’a dodie!!
post delivery was my absolute worst job and yet i miss it sometimes
!! I love this so much! The training montage managed to be both hilarious and really heartfelt.
Is that Dan's laugh in the beginning in the background? omg
Is that Pewdiepie's laugh at 0:44?
This song is amazing! What to listen ti next? ASMR videos (like the roleplays I create😁)! Get tingles and set your intention for happier, healthier version of yourself, you deserve it 💖
Anyone know where this is filmed it's really bugging me, definitely looks like somewhere in Cornwall or Devon.
This looks like a trailer to a movie id watch for weeks
This looks like eroda
dodie rocking it since day 1
Outstanding.
I hate you too!
I kind of understand " When you go quiet, I hear my song"...
AAHHHHHH <3333
Why does it look so much like Anglesy with the peer and the path
Totally freaked out by the fact that I saved this song on a personal playlist yesterday as a hard relate and then discovered the music video is set where I grew up.. What.
Title says it all...
As someone with anxiety dating someone with bipolar depression who has days where he goes nearly nonverbal, I hard relate to "When you go quiet, I hate myself." I keep trying to sing along cause the song is SUCH a banger but I just keep crying (oops!). Fabulous, dodie!! Can't wait for the album <3
You always write my favorite songs. Thank you so much, I'm obsessed w the way this sounds. So so good
The serotonin I get from watching her grow into a successful mail woman I-
This is gonna be a bop with 1500 people all in a room for a gig.   I miss gigs.
Dodie is the post lady for Eroda
YES THAT'S IT! I'M CRYING
oof all that running looks exhausting 😵 lovely art you create!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There is something wrong with me
How come no one talks about how cute Artie the Cat was??
I get the same vibes I get from 'Monster'
everybody say thank you dodie
Did no one else feel pain when they saw dodie put what looked like Mueller tape on her paper cut?
ok but this is actually so wholesome. really made my day :))
Wow! What a work of art!
lol i was too lost on the mail carriers narrative to listen to the song
I guarantee some kid just watched this and choose what they want to be when they grow up
We have immortalised the dodie dots with this mv YAYYY 🙌
You really made a video where you look like THIS I’m simping so hard- Great song
GUYS I THINK IT MIGHT BE HER BEST SONG EVER IDK
Thought that was Stormfront
This is beautiful dodie 🙁💖
Amazon works hard. Dodie works harder
me accidently listening to it at 1.25 speed.....
Magnifique!!
FUN FACT: Mail men and women WILL be the first in the rapture :)
i hate how we still have 2 months to wait for the album but this song is only making me want it more dodie this is brilliant thank you
I CANT BELIEVE IM TWO DAYS LATE BUT I ABSOLUTELY ADORE EVERY PART OF THIS😭😭😭
GREAT SON GREAT VIDEO WOWOW

I could literally watch this over and over again. You somehow match my aesthetic every time you put out a song! You are the best :D
did anyone else think of eroda
Now I really want to be a post person on a tiny seaside village/island
Cant get it out of my head!
This is beautiful!
This gave my heart a little squeeze in the best way
And the award for best music video goes to......
I don't know what to be more mesmerized at, the song or the video
doddie the postwomen
Anyone else getting Enola Holmes vibes from this? ❤️
The filming locations of this music video must be Cornwall, it’s so beautiful!! Love the music too 💛
same vibes as adore you by harry style, title is the exact opposite (adore/hate, you/myself)

It's your dream go POSTAL
This is just stunning
Postie Clark 🥰
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.“ - Jesus  Christ
Omg dodie this is so good
Have you been playing Death Stranding?
This video really pushes the envelope.
Beautiful!! This mv reminds me of ghibli movies
all hail Dodie, the daughter of Hermes
postman dobie and her grey and grey cat
lyrically this reminds me of the relationship dynamic between an anxious-preoccupied with an anxious-avoidant attachment style (for all my psychology nerds out there) - one person in the relationship is always treading on eggshells, anticipating the other's needs, afraid of rejection, of doing anything wrong - and takes the other's distance as conformation that there's something wrong with them. the other person is too afraid to share their feelings, sharing that same fear of rejection, of being 'too much', and goes quiet, shuts down and pulls away - locking themselves in their own prison, their own brain on fire.   the video for me takes this idea further - how we do one thing in life is how we do everything. perfectionism in work, the need to do everything 'right', avoid disappointment, conflict, letting anyone down are the same behaviours that also taint our personal life and our relationships.  the anxious-preoccupied obsessed with doing everything right, chasing the illusion of perfection that will one day allow that sense of transcendence and peace, 'doing the dance', running a race against themselves when no one else is chasing or even cares. they shut themselves away, never not working, with the idea that maybe one day they'll be good enough - good enough so that the other person won't go quiet, 'cross their arms' and abandon them emotionally. cognitively understanding that they can't read the other's mind, it might not be anything to do with them, but the emotional mind and body are too afraid for the other's actions or reactions to be out of their control. of course, everyone around them can see that they were worthy of wearing the 'hat' from the very start - that all the perfectionism and intricacies and speed of the job don't actually matter. all that matters is that they get the post at the end of the day. the idea that the is space for you to put your needs first, rather than be preoccupied with meeting other's perfectly - you are enough as you are, conflict in relationships or mistakes in a job are inevitable and not a result of a deep, dark inner flaw that you must compensate for your entire life.  ...or maybe I just see in this song what I see in myself, I feel u dodie xx
My heart MELTED when she got the old lady's approval :')
I love this Going Postal/Mulan crossover
miss Dorothy Clark has done it again!!!
how are all of dodie's music videos this brilliant!!! such an incredible team of people!!! love it <3
Gone Postal
Postman Pat is shook
This has such pure, calm energy that still has such alive movement without any trace of anxiety in the music. It's... amazing. Every beat, every step, is so sure-footed and well done. Thank you for putting into such effective words the thoughts so oft in my mind. 💖
https://youtu.be/jvDHDjoCgiM
this is pure magic
This video was intoxicating. I loved it
that [card shuffle percussion sound] + "nope" at 0:45 djkwahdhjlebwh I LOVE IT!!!
Good to see Sammy Paul’s name at the end :)
Really fun video!
wow this makes me want to run
absolutely incredible. also the town has strong eroda vibes? anyone?
Filmed in Polperro - Cornwall?
Clarinet!!
i can feel this blisters from the converse through this
WHY AM I CRYING OVER A POSTLADY
listened to this on the walk to work this morning and pretended i was training to be a postal worker
2:54 dodie!! I can't believe u put the parcel in the puddle smh
Hit music detected.
I'm confused why did this make me cry
i uppercase love dodie and this video.
:0
why is this recorded in super omega wide
1:08 in Cool Girl, one lyric says “I’ll spit to the left, carry on, just smile and say youre good.” It’s dodie’s right, but our left, but she is smiling and spitting to the side.   EDIT: messed up the lyric. But revisiting it let me notice how that particular lyric in Cool Girl references miscommunication, which other commenters have highlighted is the general allegory dodie highlights in this video on mail as communication.
WE LOVE A WOMAN IN UNIFORM
Dodie reporting for duty.
When she's sorting the mail I'm just picturing the Grinch tossing jury duty notifications, eviction notices, black mail etc.
This is completely and utterly beautiful.
this video is so interesting in comparison to just listening to the song and lyrics alone. changed my perspective quite a bit
this was adorable
Yes!!! Dodie is woke!!
It should be CRIMINAL for this to be so good
Has YouTube produced a more original, consistent or delightful music artist than Dodie?
Others:  *Compliments music* *Song Interpretation*  Me: *Reads comments*  How TF they comment 5 days ago when this premiered just 21 hours ago?
Just searched i hate myself this come out
The cutest
yes yes yes
GODDD THIS IS SO GOOD. sounds like the antithesis to monster
im SO proud of u, doddie!!!! u are doing amazing sweetie and i love u 💖
I'm sure this is Clovelly, right?
I  NEED to know where they shot this video the scenery is breathtaking <3  anyone plz help
you just get better. this is marvellous, dodie <3  beautiful video too. Where was it filmed? looked at first like st abbs in scotland - my favourite harbour
This is so cool. Please do an explanation video
Woow I'm listening from outside🤗😍
Not me being excited bc Ive been to Polperro ahh
Dodie training to be a mailman in a 3 minute montage is just the thing I needed today
I loved this. Too much.
Eroda.
Going postal never looked so good!
Where in the UK is this filmed?! it looks so familiar!
I love this so much 😭

"Special Thanks: Artie The Cat"  the respect he deserves
Great track and seriously impressed with the video Sammy!
postal dodie at your service
gotta be honest im kinda loving this new trend of music videos being just one person. i know its mostly just cause of the pandemic but idk just seems more intimate i love it✨
this is so beautiful im---
I LOVE THIS DODIE HOW CAN YOU BE THIS GOOD STOOOOP
Dear God It made me cry at the end, it’s purrfect❤️
BUILD A PROBLEM DUANDGAJDBSJ
I need dodie in movies asap
fucked up katie morag vibes
It's sad then it's happy story
this video has a "I'll make a man out of you" vibe
ERODA????
This is probably the most excited I’ve been for an album release. Can’t wait to listen to the full thing when it comes out!
AHH OMG
This gives me a major Studio Ghibli vibe i love it so much
OH MY GOD
What town is this filmed in? I think I've been there before.
“When you go quiet, I hate myself” oof this line I- As someone who constantly overthinks and cares so much about how the other person is feeling when with me, this line resonates so loudly. Thank you Dodie for managing to voice my subconscious thoughts
😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
This a beautiful song sang in gibberish
بحبك
I gotta send this to my mom omg I love this
A postie
CAT
postie
Third time listening and I find it so fascinating how you can create so much of an atmosphere with the smallest amount of key musical ideas. As always stunning and soft vocals with interesting use of phrasings (gave me a Joni Mitchell feel not in tone just the way you accentuated the lyrics to fit the verse). I think dynamics are brilliant and the almost percussive vocal melody near the end adds so much flow. Lovely to hear the gang vocals make a return as-well!!! Keep it up!! (Btw to anyone reading this hope you’ve eaten and drunk some water have a wonderful day) :’))
Yes !
Was this filmed in Polperro? Looks like it
Amazing as always
THATS PORPERO !!!!!! I use to stay in the little cottege
ITS 18 ON TRENDING IM SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU DODIE 💖
Fantastic song and video. You and your team should be very proud. Dodie the Postie!
Is this filmed in the uk looks like Cornwall or could it be Greece  Help

Very Very few things were ever cuter than postwoman Dodie, great stuff girl. <3
Your music videos are so poetic and the directing is so good, so fresh. I love this one
This is so good
In this video you did better than PostNord have ever done
It's incredible how you manage to create such beautiful pieces with every song you make!
Love this song🔥
can't stop thinking of Klaus hahaha
I grew up in Polperro
dodie is the cutest most talented human. I love the energy she puts into the world. It is so pure and so needed and I loveee the vibe/aesthetic of this whole thing. Thanks for this dodie, seriously a light in a dark year. <3 Love it so much!
bro i spent the entire last few days waiting for the premiere and then FORGOT and was 17 hours late WHYYYY
INCREDIBLE
This is the video I needed in my life.
Awesome video! Was it filmed in Polperro? Looks very similar to where we stayed a couple years ago
WHY is this the best soundtrack and movie of 2021
*speechless*
That lil sea side town is so aesthetic to
Giving me *incredible* Terry Pratchett's "Going Postal" vibes omg
im obsessed, one of my new fav dodie videos
TRENDING, BABY!
the last part is just beautiful
WHY IS NO ONE POINTING OUT THAT IT LOOKS LITERALLY LIKE ERODA OMG
I like the lyrics, but it sounds like shes got the mic against her nose while she sings
My heart LIVES in Polperro <3 Dodie you lil' stunner x
This. Is. INCREDIBLE.
I love u dodie
the dodie delivery service™️
dunno why but dodie gave me a The Doctor's companion vibes
I love it so much <3 <3
I'M SO PROUD
Dodie you are absolute MAGIC!!!! ❤😍 it's like you know when I'm having a bad day and then you come in with your beautiful voice and self making me feel better!!!!! You are truly a wonderful person!!
Idk why but the scenery in my head is  running in the hill after he proposed
mad Studio Ghibli vibes
Honestly - as a postman - HARD relate.
This ends sooo beautifully the music uh yes
Proof that dodie sings in cursive: i had just woken up and played this immediately and did a double take becus i thought the words were backwords. I thought it was a new musical thingamajig
So now I feel a lot more prepared for 2021.
I was so invested in the story I forgot I was supposed to be thinking about the song only. The idea of a post person is just genius I love it 💖💖💖
Lyrics: [Verse 1] Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say!? Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me (Mmm-mmm-mmm)  [Verse 2] I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh, how do we get here Every time? One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me  [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!) (Nope)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Verse 3] Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh what if I laugh now Think I'm insane Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me  [Verse 4] Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose Oh, one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me  [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (K)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Bridge] Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh, something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how I'm only worth losing now Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear (No I don't...) Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear  [Outro] No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) No, I don't think I can help it (Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)  Edit: Holy moly! Thank you so much for all the likes!
anyone else got klaus vibes haha??
She's going to postal heaven
woman ascends to become postal service deity
i've been a fan for more than 5 years at this point and i almost cried at how high quality this video is HOW FAR OUR ICON HAS COME
Beautiful song, awesome vid!
Why does this make me want a wlw version of that movie Klaus-
I don't know why some people are surprised, of course it's good, you're super talented :]
cuffing the trousers is a mood
So so soo good! As if I expected anything else. Got it on repeat, big love ❤
THIS VIDEO IS SO CUTE
Also, is this Klaus?
First things first, you're running in Converse, that's at least 11 seconds off your fastest pace.   I would recommend high support Asics if you pronate.
So effin good.
POLPERRO!!! Ps- Beaut song... Beaut vid...10/10 as always
Perfect beautiful amazing!!!
Dodie's music always feels like a huge hug. Even when her music is sad, I feel comforted. And when it's happy, I feel warm inside. So good ❤️
I would like this postal service please
I love your art so much
DODIE EVERGARDEN ( if you see this comment dodie check out violet evergarden to understand this reference mmm yea, its beautiful, and the music is beautiful)
Like the tune but couldn’t make out the words.
You’ve done it again dodie!!! 🥺❤️ we love it!! We love youuu!!
i’ve just finished a Christmas temp job at a mail sorting office and this is stressing  me out 😂
how do i inject a song into my body  asking for a friend
Woweee! Incredible!

I wish the royal mail were that fast in polperro couldn't you stay?
why do i always cry when i watch a new music video from you. its so good Dodie <333
Postman pat had a glowup
Gosh I love the video! Really nice story and the visuals!!!
eroda vibes
"When you go quiet I hate myself" is such a powerful line
The postman pat origin story we have all been waiting for
POSTMAN DODES
I don't think lyrics have ever spoken to me like these before..  It's so dumb but so hard to stop! :D  And I love the video! It's adorable and it reminded me of the movie KLAUS :)
Anyone else seen KLAUS animated movie form Netflix??  Well this video reminds me on it.. alot
I LOVE ITTTTTT !!!!!!
this made me an unreasonable level of emotional
This video concept has to be one of my favourites 😍 It's giving me Postman Pat/John Lewis Christmas advert vibes in the most beautiful, aesthetic, vintage way 💖
i have a big crush on post office dodie
Okay I love this, but that paper parcel on the wet step... argh!
That has to be the hardest working woman in that town.
why did this video give me Klaus flash backs :') in the absolute best way possible
this is so good that i'm starting to hate myself too
I love this so much!
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
kind of reminds me of the mulan "make a man out of you" sequence, great video!
I showed this to my brother and he just said "wow she would hate online school when everyone's got their mics off"
just me or does this really looks like where adore you was filmed
Man, I need to get running 😂 (this was amazing as always)
I love you dodie!
Beautiful as always. I love the lady in the window ☺️. Once again I am super hyped for the album. March feels so far away 😭
👍🏾👍🏾❤️❤️
👍🏾👍🏾❤️❤️
Dodie is you are a musical genius 🙇‍♀️ 🙇
Wow Sammy you have out done yourself!!   That was a movie 🎥
Does that mean we need to show more appreciation to post/ delivery people?
Dodie Postal Service movie when?
I want to be dodie's friend so much. I feel similar things. Every new song, I cry. Why am I such a crybaby... beautiful and emotional, that's what dodie's music is.
Where was this filmed? It's beautiful.
Incredible work all round! :D
Of course, she cuffs her trousers we stan a bi icon. A bicon if you will.
yes, please, and thank you.
SO (NOT) READY FOR BUILD A PROBLEM!! HATE MYSELF AMAZING
Bless u Sammy ✨
2:34 bi confirmed
The Video makes me weirdly proud of my boyfriend who is working as a postman! 😅
Forget Postman Pat, we've got Postwoman Dodie Clark! :-D <3
I’ve listened to this too many times. I reloaded my YouTube recommended page 20-odd times, and this popped up every single time. It hasn’t even been 24 f**king hours.
why did I tear up when you saluted at the lady
Amazing, and is it just me that is getting strong Norway vibes from the location, it just feels so like home.
omg.. i love youuu:0
same :/
Typical bi, cuffing her trousers
WHAT THIS IS SO GOOD
Very nice simple but emozional at the same time song and video!!!!!  🎸🌈🌈🌈
thanks dodie, finally I find myself an anthem for ✨social anxiety✨
I can't wait to receive the album!
Dodie and Sammy and everyone - this is fantastic!
SHE NEVER MISSES!!!!!!!
Absolutely blown away by this. The concept and execution is just flawless! <3
Замечательно
Watch me listen to this on loop
SAMMYYYYYYYY 😍 beautiful.
as I was listening to this song for the 100th time it suddenly dawn on me that dodie has most accurately described what goes on in my brain during the overwhelming anxiety of scilence   my mind is blown
Love it! So cute
god this is fucking fantastic
Is this klaus the music video
dodie can hear what my mouth and my heart wants to spit out and I love how she transforms the way I feel into a song. MY HERO. 💚
Is this Eroda?
a Klaus live action movie we all needed👏🥺
Mom dad I found my passion. I want to be a mailman.
I LOVE U IM SO PROUD OF U
dodie, the song is amazing but CAT!!!! 2:35
WHY IS EVAN'S CAT IN THE CREDITS?????? I love this song soooo much dodie you are amazing!!!
I’ve suffered with eating disorders for years, and tonight, I’ve decided it’s time to get help. I keep listening to this song to remind me of the feeling I had when I finally decided I need help so that I don’t forget in the morning. Edit: I’m officially in a treatment facility!!!
Arty the cat 💕
ok i was listening to this song while doing some chores and now i HAVE to write down my interpretations of certain lyrics or i will explode  "one will fold their arms, one will do the dance" someone (dodie) is "doing the dance" ie: doing things for her partner to open up, while the partner is simply standing their crossing their arms. i also saw someone say that "dancing" is another word for "fighting" but idk how to make that fit in for context  "eyes closed, isn't helping. when you go quiet i hate myself" dodie tries her best to ignore the problem, but closing her eyes isn't enough - because the issue is to do with the silence. communication is key in any relationship so you can't just work-around it by pretending you do not see it U _ U  "pushing a boundary, something to prove  strong expectation, you already lose" + "give me a mystery, maybe they'll bloom for me  it's always the quiet ones, something that must be done" to me, these lyrics mean dodie (consciously or not) goes into these sorts of relationships with the mindset of wanting to fix/change them, helping them come out of their shell with dodie's assistance. she sees it as a responsibility and sets herself up for failure when it doesn't end up working out. dodie thinks she has to "prove" herself by changing her partners for the better. (please don't do this lol)  "i'm hoping i'm ready here, don't think they get me dear" this one... i'm not too sure. i think it's either dodie confiding in her partner, or vice versa. leaning towards the latter, though. don't quite know yet what deeper meaning (if any) this holds but it sticks out to me for some reason  misc: could be unintentional, but it feels there are fewer pauses between lyrics compared to her other songs. almost like dodie is trying to fill the silence because it's so anxiety-inducing. i'm 100% reading wayyy too much into that but it's just smth i noticed and is cool to think about   will add more if i get any other random spurts of ideas
AAAAAA
wow klaus looks so good!
Oh i see those Queen Gambit makeup dots :))
amazing, thinking of the film "Klaus", very cool !
Post Lady Dodie, Police Woman Dodie?  She can do it all!
I love this!! <3
Adore You vibes~
Is anybody else getting "Violet Evergarden" vibes? Especially with the letters and the uniform
Wonderful song
When she sung "build a problem now" it's like when actors say the movie name during the movie
Song: Amazing Video: AMAZING Don't know what ai was expecting but I loved that video, it made my heart swell. And the song is of course so relatable and amazing
Lovvvve iiit
Is it weird that i recognised Hazel and Dan's laughs immediately?
This Postman Pat remake is wild but I dig it <3 All seriousness though, this was cool!
Oh dodie, thank you for your content 🥰🥰
It took me a bit to watch this one cause I feared being triggered, sorry.  Glad I'm watching it now 💗
better than amazon XD love the song and the visuals! <3
Where was this filmed?! It looks neat :D
oh,wow.....Beautiful picture/Nice bass sound ,by the way!
SO GOOD.
This gives me major Klaus vibes 😂😍
This is Polperro!! I did lots of growing up here :)
The cat 100% stole the show and I love that he’s in the credits
THIS IS GREAT
A wonderful ‘Kate  Bushy’ ambiance. I just loved this song! 😍
Mmmm hi yes I am once again in love with a music video this is so cute
I like everything about this song but the first 9 seconds. I don't know why it takes that long to match the beat.
at 2:11 , when she finally did it, but then her expression turned into “oh it’s on now” BRO ITS SO SIMPLE BUT SO GOOD
i love how blue this video is
Thank you for this birthday gift.
this is the most magical song dodie's ever made
Video giving Klaus vibes
I cried. I have BPD, and i self-sabotage. trying really hard to stay in relationship with my boyfriends right now. I can relate to every words of the lyrics
Dodie imma need you to deliver all the letters I'm sending telling people how fire this music video is 🔥 Also I want your hat.
I love this so much!
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS
Love everything about this. Your arrangments & instrumentation are really special.
The cinematography is immaculate. Beautiful. I love it
This would be the best postal service ever if it existed.
This is so British and I love it
Dodieeeeeeee!!!!! This is so cute I love it.
I love klaus 😌
I feel this has to do with letting go with (not of) your feelings.  That all you can do is send out your feelings and not expect someone to reciprocate them or expect them to tell you everything.  You should put on the blindfold and not worry about what others think.  Love yourself and send out your feelings and emotions.  You'll drive yourself crazy trying to expect or figure out how others feel.  All you can do is accept and love yourself.  Hence why she's a postperson.  She's becoming the person who can leave those messages and feelings on their doorstep without worrying about what they think about her.    Once the package is delivered, you move on to the next one.  You don't deserve to hurt yourself for thinking it's your fault someone doesn't get you or won't share.
Postman Pat Origins: The Musical
We STAN our postal workers
Why does it feel like a Studio Ghibli scene.... I feel Kiki's delivery service vibes omygod

CC would be really helpful, I don't catch a lot of the words, but this also gave the same vibes as Harry Styles 'adore you' and now I headcanon he lives in the same village as post carrier Dodie.
this is amazing, thank you so much dodie!
Dodie singlehandedly saved the USPS and she isn’t even American 😅
love the song and the message you deliver (literally and figuratively)

I just started listening to some of your songs because your voice is so calming, and this song didn’t disappoint! Not only is your voice beautiful, so is the message!
I remember a video where dodie was talking about her trauma with an abusiva relationship where the person would go quiet when they were mad and she would struggle with her friend being normally quiet and feel bad about upsetting them. this really hits home i love you dods
oh my gosh it’s just so fantastic
everything you make is amazing! i love this so much
praying for a behind the scenes for this video - bloody brillant
I MISSED THE LIVE AND SCREAMED  GAH I HATE MYSELF
was I supposed to cry? because I did
anyone else start crying when the lady in the window gave her a thumbs up and she saluted
This whole video and Dodie's adorable outfits all reminded me of a Studio Ghibli film. Loved this!
I hate myself too haiz...
Okay I adore the song but what is this video??! So high budget. Sammie did an amazing job
Interesting movie, but I didn't get the idea. What is it about?
what a beautiful story this video tells. gotta listen to this ish on repeat now.
How funny, your video was right next to Jamie's in my feed. 😊 I loved the song and the video--well done!
@doddleoddle  Best training montage I’ve seen in years! The location choice was almost as beautiful as the song. Very well done, Dodie. ❤️👍
When she ascends to mail heaven at the end 🤩
What a cute little film :) Amazing song as always.
i’ve literally just been listening to this and sea shanties all day
AMAZING
Is this: a modern version of Lark Rise to Candleford
Dodie, listen. Past the self hatred is a deeper silence and it is filled with the mystery, the love, the bliss. Maybe you already know. I hope you do. Inside of you it is!
YOURE SO SO COOL ALWAYS
Every single shot is gorgeous oh my GOD
This was a masterpiece
Uummm this is so cool
Greetings from a Venezuelan , i love your music !
Klaus looks different than I remember
DODIE YOURE SO GOOD!
Such a beautiful and raw so excited for the album
this is SUCH VIBES
i love you Dodie and i hate myself too
Yes
The prep for this mustve taken ages 😂 its lovely though ❤
dodie really delivered with this one.  Imma see myself out.
most dramatic "I'm Quitting Music to Deliver Mail Full Time" announcement ever 10/10
when she said "no i don't think" i felt that
AHHH THIS IS SO GOOD
Amazing~
The best video u did ever 💕 the song name though I didn't like it
queen of hating herself 😩🤲
Not since fallout new vegas has a mailman been so hyped. Awesome song though.
Dodie.... did you visit Eroda ??
I was surprised at the end when they got raptured by the mail got, but I’m on board.
My dad and I just listened together! So amazing! (I love that I've gotten my dad into your music, when I say "Dodie released a new album" he knows who I mean lol)
the way I’ve been watching this over and over on a loop for like an hour😐
I love this music video! Good work. :)
For me, this song feels like a really good description of flirting (how performative it can feel) especially when you add severe social anxiety on top of that. Socially anxious flirting is a whole mind game that I play every day 😅
Love the feel of this video, great job dodie and her team!
Me: thinking it's a video I've already watched and isn't new Yt who's been recommending the video intensely for the past 6 hours: this was posted 6 hours ago Me: FUCCCKKK-
i am pissed beyond words that I missed the premiere, but I had a stupid grin on my face for the whole song! AAAAAAHHH!!!
https://youtu.be/uBKAaAAJsvg
Indeed it is hard when you are trying to deliver a message, but get a cold response (or none at all) and you feel like it’s your fault. Hugs to anyone experiencing this! Thank you for this, Dodie! Brilliant as always.
This music video is an excuse for Dodie to cosplay as Jesper from the animated film Klaus, and I'm not mad at it ❤ This album is gonna be a gift!
oh, Dodie. I just love you so
postwoman dodie made want to fast forward to march 5th so bad!
Dodie, if you ever in your life get movie offers, don't let them have your soul.
wow 🥺🌿✨
Amazing, as always!
THE COLOR SCHEME
DODIE POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY YAYYYY
ASHNIKKO AND DODIE IN ONE DAY? I LOVE THIS!!!!
Absolutely amazing! You're my biggest influence when it comes to creating music. Just absolutely love how ethereal your songs are and your harmonies are always on point. 😊💕 Hope you're doing good
I looooooved that videoooooo
i did not expect to cry over postal dodie this early in my day
I hit a new low today and all I wanna say is, thank you. This song made me feel less alone.
Really it’s just dodie training to reply to all the fan mail she’s recieved
Just added this to my Amazon playlist :)
Does anyone know what the chords are for this? 💛
That was so beautiful Dodie!!! 💜
I love this song so much!! I can't wait for the album
:O
this has big discworld energy!!
BRUH
It is honestly a little embarrassing how cool I think she looks in this video. Like she really did it! She achieved the most delightful of goals!!
dodiiiiiie you ROCKSTAR!!!! would love a breakdown of the deep meaning of the video concept
Me after seeing the name of the song:  nooo don’t hate yourself you are the best 🥺🥺
your video ideas are always so unique & entertaining... I just love you so much
i LOVE that dodie got her Pop moment of riding on a wide-handled bicycle with a big basket.... but dodie style so it's cute and riding through gorgeous woods as a postwoman ah
really like the direction/editing that's similar to human - esp. when putting on the outfit!
Made me think how it feels when you are putting ALL the effort into communicating efficiently and properly (video Dodie), but when someone shuts down and doesn't communicate with you it feels useless when they won't open up to you (person in song) ~ anxiety
Fantastic, as usual!
wth I needed this rn, thx stalker
I just keep getting more and more hyped for the album
She's a postwoman bcos her voice and music always deliver
Best mailman training montage I've ever seen.
This video is making me want a dark academia themed show starring dodie
Lyrics:  [Verse 1] Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say!? Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me (Mmm-mmm-mmm)  [Verse 2] I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh, how do we get here Every time? One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me  [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!) (Nope)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Verse 3] Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh what if I laugh now Think I'm insane Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me  [Verse 4] Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose Oh, one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me  [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (K)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Bridge] Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh, something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how The moment we're losing now Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear (No I don't...) Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear  [Outro] No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) No, I don't think I can help it (Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Klaus (2019) Dodie edition
I love every single thing about this <3 Beautiful song, amazing video, Dodie as the post office's Karate Kid :D
I SAW THAT TROUSER CUFF
omg dodie i love this :DD  i was just wondering if you would have some tips for people who want to start writing songs (esp the melody parts) :) thank you sm
Literally amazing, im so unbelievably excited for the album <3
2:34: SHE CUFFED THE JEANS! I REPEAT, SHE CUFFED THE JEANS
SAMMYYYYYY
My brain is broken- how did it come out 5 hours ago but there are comments from 5 days ago-
i remember an old video of dodie talking about her ex, and how when he was mad he'd go quiet. i'm guessing that's what the line "when you go quiet i hate myself" is from. aaa anyway i love this so much
Ok now i need a full video explanation otherwise i'm just making assumptions of what they mean
so physical : D
dodie delivery service
<3 <3 <3
Little bit toooo relatable lol

That was just beautiful. Thank you, dodie!

Alright but she became a mail carrier and then ASCENDED? Why are we pretending that’s normal?

Postman dodie
all of the letters look pretty packaged in different colored envelopes
Wow I didn’t know that this song would hit this close to home. Im just realizing how often I hate myself especially when my partner goes quiet
I love the idea of a postie training montage
I LOVE IT AH
Wish dodie would deliver my packages maybe they'd come on time.
Approving Windowsill granny is so cute.
THE LIL SALUTE IS ADORABLE AHHH
big "adore you" and "golden" music video vibes!!!
move over postman pat
me before hate myself: "build a problem is a cool name, i don't really get what it means though :/" me after hate myself: OHHHH
FUCKED UP HOW GOOD THIS IS
I get gayer and gayer every day
Feels like a tribute to the Netflix movie „Klaus“ 😁❤️
Postal Worker Dodie for next Dr Who!
So goooood !
ooo YISSSSSS i heard you drop that “build a problem” line. i love seeing where artists derive their album title from. this song obviously means so much to you, Dodie, and comes from such a personal space. thank you for sharing it with us!
postal service dodie is my new a e s t h e t i c ✨
absolutely incredible! what a lovely music video and piece! astonishing
You are becoming one of my favorite artist.
Dodie is sounding more like she has a blocked nose
Perfection 😍
this is wonderful but the postwoman theme and the whole album being called build a problem reminds me of how our good friend donald built a whole problem with the US mail system and the elections lol
I'd like a full length film now! 🤍
The woman in the window is Sammy's mum which means both of his parents have now been in dodie music videos.
if anyone’s wondering where this is filmed i think it’s polperro in cornwall england :)
Omg dodie! Your the best, my sister is OBSESSED with you!
You're really good in acting
The "Directed by Sammy Paul" made me so unreasonably happy. God, I miss my friends.
it is really amazing dodie
wait look in the description- heady was a runner 🥺
AHHHHHH THIS IS AMAZINFGGGGGH
Anyone know where this is filmed?
This is absolutely beautiful
DANIEL'S LAUGH IM IN LOVE
Hermes could never
Love your story telling, beautiful song too.
The mailwoman of my musical dreams name is dodie
Love!
I love the storytelling of this
3 hours late but OMG DODIE DOTS YESSSSS
Are you kidding me? I mean we all knew it was going to be absolutely amazing but.. THIS IS SO GOOD. Even just the start before we hear any lyrics. It just has such a rich Dodie sound. This is exactly what I needed today. Thank you!!
This song rules and this video rules even more.
Absolutely wonderful!
Now I know what I’m blasting on repeat this year haha 😆
DODIE MAILWOMAN
Gosh your MVs and songs just can’t stop getting more gorgeous
loving the concept for the video, the lighting and everything's perfect
wow what a video
Are we not going to talk about the cat at 2:35?
lovely as hekkk. I would die if dodie was the postperson on my place LOL
Guitless music video has left scars I panicked when she set the box down and opened it
I'm excited to see more from Dodie the postwoman. Really hoping this is a story throughout build a problem
No one:  Dodie: *cuffs pants*
Dodie as a post woman. Who knew I had the kink
I clicked solely because of the name and if that says something about me I don’t want to know what it is
anyone else getting eroda vibes from that island?
Dodi you have such amazing talent and a sound and vibe like no other!
2:33 We do love that bi energy
Who are the 41 people that DARE thumbs down this video? What a bop
Dodie is the type of person you want to mindlessly roam a city with.
YESSSS
grandma stealing the show here
dodie you look very british in this video
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Absolutley amazing as always! Love this!!!
SO SO SO GOOOOD
Dodie = Postman Pat.  I love it 😍
Reminds me so much of the movie Klaus!!
This music video is so wholesome x
It's physically impossible for Dodie to make a bad song. And that's a fact.
The helplessness, the self deprecation, and the guilt are so well-portrayed in this song!
gorgeous studio ghibli vibes 🥺
Today is my 18th. birthday and this is the perfect gift!
genuinely curious - what's the floury stuff at the beginning that she dusts her hands with? is it just chalk to keep her hands dry or something?
YOU NEVER DISSAPOINT
OMG DODIE THIS IS SO GOOD
outdoing yourself every single time! go dodie!
Postman kinda cute doe
OMG YES DODIE
Really like the layered vocal thing youre doing (dunno whats it actually called) it encourages the listener to go back over the song to catch what you're saying. Isnt too complicated (repeating previous lyrics) on top of sounding great.  I can also get why some dont like it (confusung and percieved as audio noise)   Anyways. Another great video to match it. Looking forward to Trying To Stan Doddie part 4
Absolutely amazing as per usual. You never cease to amaze me 💖
2 seconds in and I already love it 🥰
Dodie's Delivery Service 🧹🐾💌 hahahaha literally the first thing i did in the morning was to watch the mv when i have exams in 30 mins hahahaha as olweyz wuv uwu sososmuch dodieeee bye
Okay I'm just so in love with Dodie's acting and she doesnt even say a word. I need a long 2 hour film staring her and only her.
Is that Eroda
it's the one that drops the album name 🐸 we got treated :)
❤️
tw!!! does anyone else think this is in part about anorexia/an eating disorder? especially with that moment 1:10
Postman Pat: Origins
listening to this during my night routine  *dramatically applies moisturiser as the final beat fades*
special mentions  artie the cat <3
i love
dodie this is IMMACULATE
dodie the post girl🥺🥺🥺

What aspect  What Aspect Ratio is this?
omg I missed the Premiere, but I love it so much
This is the greatest music video i've ever seen
The atmosphere in the music video is so tangible, I’m obsessed with it.
The hums at the end SENT. ME.
SHE NEVER MISSES !!!!!! ALWAYS BOPS NEVER FLOPS !!!!!!
the song is lovely but I was so enamoured by the story that I couldn't tell you anything you said in the song LOL
dodie eroda mailman confirmed
I DONT WANT TO WATCH A FUCKING AD ABOUT SKETCHERS SNEAKERS, I WANNA WATCH A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART YOUTUBE
this is so clever omigodddd
So creative!! Both musically and visually stunning😄 And the concept behind the video was so quirky and perfect and wonderful 😁😍
Adorably wholesome™️
anime training montage
OKAY I LOVE THIS what the heck even?!?! So cute and perfect in just every way, my heart is so full💓💓💓
0:15 1:14 1:53 2:07  Rey? :O
This was so good thanks for this
19k upvotes to less than 100 downvotes. That means 99.9948% are living for this.
I can't help but think about an example of our anxious thoughts as a jumping monkey when Dodie says "I know - it's a me thing" following "brain on fire". This monkey is jumping around all the time and never stopping, and because of that we feel tired and overwhelmed. We don't know how to feel relaxation because of this restlessness, and try to think ourselves out of this problem. Essentially,  we're trying to use the monkey to try and control the monkey. I resonated with this thinking in an argument when someone internalizes, but think it simply happens with anxiety; overthinking fueling a problem caused by the overthinking!! The new Guide to Meditation special on Netflix probably describes this more eloquently if you'd like to learn more, but this is a wonderful video that is so reflective.   Thank you so much Dodie! <3
Wow that cat was really fucking cute.
this video turns into such a sigh of relief for me
well aren’t you clever and talented
AHHHHHHHHHH
dodie really here killing the gays with her looks AAAATHIS WAS AMAZIIING
i love thisss
Dodie: *cuffs jeans*
I want to live in this music video
This is the most aesthetic video I have ever seen! I’m In love 😍
SO SO BEAUTIFUL !
cant believe me and dodie have so much in common
let's point out how she's showing that any job is worth preparing the hardest for even if it's an ordinary everyday job, imagine if all our postman/postwoman were this good at their work (also if they were valued enough to make it worth work this hard) I'm just thinking way too hard abt this
1:50 🥴💕
I relate to this so much I put all my worth on my success and I need to me perfect 24:7 I really like this music video thank you for putting it into words so to speak, thank u dodie - ps - ur so pretty
This video, and song, is gorgeous ❤️
Not gonna lie, saw the title and I was like "same though! Time to listen to a masterpiece!"
why is every Dodie music video so wholesome
this video reminds me of the film klaus, and i mean that as a sincere compliment
🔥🔥🔥🔥
DODIE FUCKING CLARK I JUST AAAAAA
this song signed, sealed, and fucking delivered.another beautiful video dodie (and the amazing crew who brought this together)
the visuals DODIE oh my GOD- the song- it’s connects so well i’m gonna scream
so amazing 💛🥰
Somehow I’m crying, it might be my slightly unstable mental state, but I do think I could only cry about a postie if it’s Dodie :)
ugh it's just sOOO GOOD!!
Please don't leave all those parcels out in the damp! Love the song!!!
DODIE EVERYTHING YOU DO I LOVE IT
Banger!
Can someone please explain this videoclip to me? I don’t understand these kind of things because my head is very logical. I would love to understand the story and what ‘hate yourself’ has to do with working at a post office.   Thanks in advance. ♥️
Shout out to artie the cat getting proper billing in the credits
I truly and deeply love it ❤️
This one has strong violet evergarden vibes to it. Nicee
sigh *presses replay button for the 5th time*
This reminds me of Klaus!! Which is like my favorite movie so it’s a good thing
dodie: i hate myself  me: oh my god me too. we have so much in common. let’s discuss that over a coffee date.     please. i am begging you.😩😘🥺
I love Dodie as the mail woman for this Eroda-esque scene <3
Klaus walked so dodie could run
every song dodie releases is exponentially better than the one before it, no matter how good it was. She keeps releasing masterpiece after masterpiece, and they all keep topping each other. I absolutely adore it
I'm gonna have to watch this like 15 times before I really take it all in and I'm 10000% okay with that
Ooooo this is GOOOOOOODDDDDDD
is that the tupperware tapping i hear?? love it :)
this clip gave me so much power right now!!!!
The postlympics is coming up and I know who's gonna win GOLD

This is how Howarts students should get their letters
i just love so much your music can’t wait for the album <3
For the whole day, I've been thinking "Wow, it's getting harder to live in this world." Now, suddenly I'm pumped to be here after listening to this, tbh. I'm serious! :D That's quite the impact.
Love you Dodes.
this made me dance through my flat and feel so much joy which is weird for a song with this title
GAH SO GOOD!! I also just love that the likes of Reb, Ciaran and Sammy are involved. Go team 🥳😍
Firstly, GORGEOUS STUNNING AMAZING! Secondly, where the heck was this filmed, I somehow feel like I recognise it, so I MUST know
Dooooodddiiiiiieeeeeeee 🤩
i’m in a relationship right now where she never responds to me for hours at a time and this song is speaking to me jesus
Just got out of my therapy session to find this song. Poingiant.
Everyone be filming stuff in Cornwall because of less covid restrictions!
I’m so straight for this bisexual.
okay but this training montage is more compelling than 90% of movie montages i just want postwoman dodie to succeed 🥺🥺 live ur dreams, postwoman dodie!!! deliver those letters!!!
I'm sitting in my bedroom crying over a mailwoman's success story and there's nothing else I'd rather be doing right now.
Lovely!
she’s only gone and done it again!!!! i love this
Love this.
this song is just so beautiful
a master piece!
I wish my postie looked like dodie 🥲
how did I miss dodie cuffing those postmaster pants at 2:34 like the icon she is?! i love this song.
jesussssss if someone doesn’t use this as a montage song for a movieeeee
this was recommended for me on the front page of youtube and i absolutely LOVE THIS VIDEO and song wowww

Siri, why am I crying.
This is beautiful.
strong independent postwoman we love to see it
This made my day better
How can I even come up with a comment expressing how much I LOVE this song & video?! I'm not responding to messages for the next week I'm just replaying this a thousand times
Amazing ❤️✨
god this is art.
That music video was next level
A triumph! Visually, musically and lyrically.
KERNOW! <3      (Dodie can you confirm my hunch is correct? This was filmed in Cornwall?)
this is a masterpiece. my god i am so gay.
i love this SO much you all knocked it out of the park again
That cuffing the trousers shot though 👌
this is sos so sos so everything dodie you have done it again
it's gonna take me WEEKS to absorb the production of this song I'm ngl, not complaining tho I love this song more than myself
The positive, algorithms changing, absolutely beautiful comment has arrived! ❤️ Amazing work! I love it Ⓜ️
I LOVE IT SO MUCH
*grunkle stan voice* Now this! This is great!
This made cry just bc I’m just so proud of how far you’ve come as an artist. Cant wait for the rest of the album!!! 😭♥️
holy shit this video is BEAUTIFUL
i’m never NOT impressed- i seriously love this.
are you kidding me?? i want a whole movie now!!
ow papercut to my soul
So the symbolism could be, that we think we can only "deliver" when we're doing so perfectly. Constantly striving for perfection, but in the end, what we needed to release ourself and give ourself fully to others, was already there.  She could've put on that uniform in the beginning, she still did what she needed to do, self restraint is harsh.  Just my own interpretation.
So many letters but no replies...         When you go quiet, I hate myself
bisexual postal lady lowkey cuffing her trousers confirmed
i am OBSESSED with this
I love how many different ways you can interpret this! I see it as the letters representing Dodie’s feelings - she tries to compartmentalise them in the slots and carry them all herself but sometimes it’s too heavy and they spill out. x
❤️🎈👏👏👏👏👏
I really appreciate that the cinematography in the later half. The shots move slower and is more stable as if they aren’t in a rush/mess delivering these “letters”. Then this uniform dodie wears and her ascension ignoring all those “letters” gives this an up note end for me. Awesomeness!!
1:50 that jump in sync with the music was so satisfying oh my gosh
dodie: *gets out the box* me, thinking back to the guiltless video: uh oh dodie: *becomes the best postwoman to ever be* me: :D
Oh the feeligns i got from this
i love both the song and the music video it was so adorable !!! can't wait to hear the rest of my new favourite album >o<
Adore You vibes. Eroda vibes. lovin it :))
Love the song and the video! Where was this video shot?
Lowkey reminds me of harry styles' 'adore you' music video
t.h.i.s.   that's all  just   t h i s
why is me hating myself so much less eloquent
God this is just so perfect- i preordered the vinyl for build a problem and I can’t wait to just sit in my room with this MASTERPIECE playing!
Lyrics!!  Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say!?

Good to know you’re the post master of Eroda ;)
Those dodie dots tho Absolutely ICONIC
That feeling when you know this album is going to change your life.
dodie cuffing her pants
Wait... did we just get a Dodie themed shounen anime-like story?  Because yes please.
Why did I cry at the end? So sweet 😭
My friend and I went to where this was filmed a few years ago! <3 it's nice to see memories happening there, real + fictional.
Dodie has made post my aesthetic
casually waiting for the incredibly insightful analyses that always pop up in the comments of dodie's videos since i for one do not know what to hecky this all means
Coolest. Clip. Eveeeeeeeeeerrrrr.
i love everything about this
ALWAYS ORIGINAL X
Feels like going postal by Terry Pratchett
I love it so much! This is such an amazing song!
We have been blessed by dodie once more with an amazing song
Woah wow wow Dodie would make such a good postie :)
This was phenomenal :)
I can‘t stop Smiling I am so in Love with this already 🥰😍💕
every song sounds like a band trying to not play loudly and disturb people in the next room
I thought Dodie was going pro-cop when I saw the thumbnail and was like “NOOOOOO!”
This video is like Kiki's Delivery Service meets Klaus.
I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE
Ohh when the rejection sensitive dysphoria hits.
This is so sweet!
ngl that uniform is cute af
These music videos are always so full of life
She's so god damn beautiful
I don't think I've ever related to a song more. There's not a single lyric I can't understand- Oh , all the conversations I spend every second ofdoubting myself.  It's a lovely song. <3
This song and this music video are soooo good i almost cried ! Once again, well done 💛
I've determined that this video is CUTE and there's no changing my mind
I love how dodie is the postal worker on Eroda.
Every wlw at that boot shot was like, oof.
Somebody watched Klaus on Netflix
the aesthetics of this video and this dodie era!! so delicious and sage coloured, I absolutely love it!! Yes!! More pls!!
oh wow, I already love it so much. The slide sounds on the guitar sounds so freaking gooooood omg. I never knew I needed to hear that sound until now
This is beautiful but i need captions
if this isn't a hint that she's posting this song through all of our letter boxes personally i don't know if i want it
The drumming and the backing vocals on this are superb!
I love this.
Love you dodie
oh dodie... you did it, girl
Bee heavy head boppering
What an upgrade from that Mickey train conductor hat
This is some studio Ghibli shit and I'm SO HERE FOR IT
are we just all going to agree that we are collectively in love with her
this was incredibly beautiful ahhhhh
1:07 triggered my phone's Google assistant 😂😂
this has such classic dodie vibes and might be my favorite of the new releases. the layering and production are just GLORIOUS and i absolutely love the big baselines and drums you've been having fun with. it adds a beautiful depth and BODY to your songs and contrasts with your voice so well, I could do a whole analysis on it. love love love it
this kinda gives me the same vibe as "the man" by taylor swift music wise
THE SONG AND THE DIRECTING LOVE IT
One element of the postal service training I think is interesting is that from an outside perspective, it seems like a job that doesn't require a lot of effort, or at least the amount of effort that dodie is putting in during the video.  And I think this means that the job choice is partly to emphasize that the average person does not look for these problems within their day to day to life or job.  (Also many other interpretations and layers to it of course!)
the brazilian postal service has so much to learn from this video
dodie's delivery service is a studio ghibli knock off i would 100% pay to see
love it!!! mailman working so hard :)
this is so beautiful woah
This is absolutely incredible!!!! I love this so much
Um.... That made 0 sense. I am so lost and confused and... I don't even know..
This reminds me of Violet Evergarden :0
man what a bop,,, I'm so excited for all the new dodie music that's going to come out!
Polperro!!!!!!
I LOVE THE WAY THIS SOUNDS:D<3 what a lovely song to wake up to and listen 💛💗 thank you Dodie!!!!
dodie the postwoman with her hat and her bike are you kidding me i'm in love
i've never been more proud.
It gives me strong "Adore you" vibes
This is stunning. Kind of reminds me of Klaus :)
I'm so proud
Story time: So my friend was excited about this song and looked up “I hate myself” on the internet.   The guidance counselor saw it.   And then my friend spent a whole thirty minutes talking with the guidance counselor, trying to convince him that she wasn’t depressed.
gorgeous
Yo looks like clovelly with that landscape
BUILD A PROBLEM HYPE
This is the reverse of Uncle Vernon when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter
I’m in love
okay but why is this the cooler live action mulan story...
It is amazing how I’ve adored every single one of dodie’s songs. On god. There is something so unique about dodie’s art that always makes me crave her music more and more.
This is one of the best songs she's put out. And this music video is literally my kind of humor
DODIE DOTS DODIE DOTS WERE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TO THIS VIDEO BC IT SCREAMS YOU ND ALSO YOUR HARMONIES IN THE BACKGROUND I CANNOT WAIT TILL THE FULL ALBUM DROPS IM EXCITED
This was wonderful in so many ways, I love this
Oh my god, this video is so beautiful! Huge props to dodie, Sammy and the creative team!
Ahhhh I love it!
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
Yess we stan a Sammy Paul music video
BUILD A PROBLEM !!!!!!

Amazing song! (As always!) Relate so much to this  Edit: also love postie Dodie !
This is such an incredible song, your voice is so soft and beautiful. The melody was so enchanting, dodie- i love it x
Cuffed trousers and the little salute at the end, SWOON 😩🥰♥️
NOICE
The Postman Pat sequel we didn’t know we needed
Was that a nod to guiltless in the music when she opened the box???
I was hoping it was Sammy Paul and I was happy to find it was indeed Sammy Paul 😁
I didn't know postman pat was this cool and good at singing
YESSSSS JUST YESSSSSSSSS
God, I needed this song, thank you dodie ❤ And if anyone is looking for the lyrics in the comments like I did:  Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh do you look angry? Oh what did I say?  Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us need Something wrong with me  I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh how do we get here Every time?  One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me  No, I don't think I can help it (No)  Oh so illogical I'm not magical I can't read your mind But how can you not hear The whole conversation I have sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet I hate myself When you go quiet I hate myself  Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh what if I laugh now? I think I'm insane  Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us need Something wrong with me  Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose  Oh one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me  No, I don't think I can help it  Oh so illogical I'm not magical I can't read your mind But how can you not hear The whole conversation I have sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet I hate myself When you go quiet I hate myself  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how I'm only worth losing now  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet I hate myself) I don't think they get me, dear  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet I hate myself) I don't think they get me, dear  No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) (When you go quiet I hate myself) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (When you go quiet I hate myself) No, I don't think I can help it
Klaus (2021)
I LUV U SOMUCYCHCJCHC
Oh Dodie...you are so lovely, inspiring, & talented!!! 💖
This strangely reminds me of the Ill make a man out of you montage from mulan but in soft
So was this a real post office or was this built in someone's basement? Great scenic design!
why is no one talking about the kiki's delivery service vibesss, the labour-training-progress thing, the sea landscape, the CAT

Wow i love everything about it! The video, the song the lyrics😍!
I felt so frustrated before this, now i'm dancing around like a lunatic to this f'ing BOP!
[Verse 1] Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh, do you look angry? Oh, what did I say!? Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me (Mmm-mmm-mmm)  [Verse 2] I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh, how do we get here Every time? One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me  [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!) (Nope)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Verse 3] Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh what if I laugh now Think I'm insane Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us needs Something wrong with me  [Verse 4] Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose Oh, one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need; Something wrong with me [Pre-Chorus] No, I don't think I can help it (K)  [Chorus] Oh, so illogical I'm not magical - I can't read your mind! But how can you not hear the whole conversation I have, sitting still with a brain on fire? I know - it's a me thing Eyes closed - isn't helping? When you go quiet, I hate myself When you go quiet, I hate myself  [Bridge] Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh, something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how The moment we're losing now Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear (No I don't...) Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something that must be done I'm hoping I'm ready here Don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet, I hate myself) Don't think they get me, dear [Outro] No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (Don't think they get me here) No, I don't think (Don't think they get me here) I can help it (When you go quiet, I hate myself) No, I don't think I can help it (Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Not me making muffins for my partner and offering to drop them round because I know they're v stressed with work atm, them saying no they're too busy and me spending the rest of the day analysing myself if I'd done something wrong just in time for this to come out ♡  Aka the most relatable thing in the history of ever
So good ... songs keep getting better and better. <3
i think i've realized that my aesthetic is this video, exactly.
oh to be the lone postman of a rainy european coasttown living in a small cottage with a bunch of letters and my cat, riding around on a bike and constantly striving to be the best deliveryperson i can be
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS AMAZING
This based off Klaus? Lol dope movie
dodie i love u i love this aah thank u!! i wasnt feeling too well today but this definitely cheered me up a bit!
This was so amazing, but it physically pained me to see the stepping on envelopes part, anyone else? Anywho, this is another masterpeice!!
All I have to say is       *Ouch.*
such a tune! Can't wait for the album. Also great job by Sammy and Ciaran, stunning video.
I always love when ppl comment their analysis of the video but I cant see any of those comments.... so here is mine. I am think that maybe it is something along the lines of getting better are telling ppl things and sending those messages about how she feels that "cool girl" was too scared to talk about. ???
thr blue hue reminds me of twighlight
Absolutely heartwarming and beautiful and agh- 5 stars omg
The song is so so so nice and the music video? omg it's SO good. i dont know what else to say. I just loved it!!
okay but this encapsulated rejection sensitive dysphoria so well
Dodie is actually such a great actress!
Beautiful work!
When dodie opened the box I had flashbacks to Guiltless
this song is a bop
I just love Dodie
so youre telling me i set my alarm for this FOUR DAYS AGO and i still missed it
omg dodie being a little gay postwoman i love this au
That 2:14 bridge HELLOOOOOOOOO??????? Help
The governments 'Rethink. Reskill. Reboot' scheme looks brutal.
Was I the only one who went "Noooo it'll get WET!" at 2:54? :D
this feels like a mixture of the Adore You music video and the movie Klaus
wondering about the letters they put into the houses
i love the DCU (dodie cinematic universe)
Was it shot in the sale village as adore you by Harry styles
dodie really foresaw the wave of postal worker related simping in 2020
this is INCREDIBLE the vibe is DELICIOUS oh my goodness
who are those 22 who down-voted,   I want a stern conversation with you ;)  Love the song,   and the clip,   sadly was an hour too late for the pre-release hype.     thanks for making the  pandemic sort of bareable with your awesome songs :D
How can I be this proud of someone I've never met?! This is amazing dodie.
this gives me ghibli in real life vibes ☺️💛
DODIE I LOVE UR MUSIC SO MUCH SOBS SOBS SOBS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OMG DODIE!!! I LOVE IT!!!! THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING!!! I LOVE THE AESTHETIC OF THE VIDEOOOOOO!!!
THATS POLPERRO I LIVE NEAR THERE WHATTTTT
SAVE THE POST OFFICE 📯  SAVE THE REPUBLIC 🗽
Oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness 🥰😍❤️
Postman pat origin story?
Can't wait to see the movie this montage is from
freakin' wonderful as always, dodie! so worth the wait :-)
Why the first thing I have thought was “Eroda?” 😅
This is so coooooolllll
she got picked up by the deadlights at the end oop
Was this video filmed in Whitby???? I feel like I recognise the scenery
so goooooooooooooood
Watching an ad for a Taylor Swift album before enjoying a new dodie music video is so ...
cuff those pants dodie
Violet Evergarden vibes.
the sequel to birdbox looks amazing 2:03
2:40 Just for future reference
Lol... cute video concept. I only wish all government workers approached their jobs with that kind of dedication. :D
Everytime dodie posts something, i experience true joy
The ✨ aesthetic ✨ omg
This has Kikis delivery service vibes
I didn’t understand that video, but I loved it never the less
she's done it again
such a beautiful video concept <3 :)
Plot twist: she had to volunteer as a postman in order to film for the music video.
I love Dodie. She works so hard for the things she passionate about. This video made me cry.
dodie said I'LL DO THE MAIL
Klaus (2019)
So... To be clear... Mailwomen have superpowers? I'm changing my profession 😂
That was so cute
Stunning 💙
this is SO GOOOD AHHHHHH
I
Oml this is incredible🥺❤ amazing work dodie❤❤
i love the video as all of yours! <3
The old woman going "👍" is what is going to keep me alive this year
i feel an intense urge to write a fanfic about postwoman dodie
Hey Dodie, love the video!! =D Dodie, could you put the option for subtitling the song in english and allow fans to translate into their native languages? i like to "read" while watching =)
Literally said "oh my God" when dodie took the postperson hat out of the box, am I the only one who didn't get what she was training for? Also teared up a bit at the old lady's thumbs up, wow wow ow ❤️
make way for...  STRONK DODIE
Is it Klaus reference?
I know that she mentioned the chords,but anyone could tell me the chords?
the hype was very very very real, love u queen
Did anyone else notice the town looked a little familiar? No? Just me? Okay😅...
BRO
The prefect mud day pick me up
🥺🥺 you’re legendary dodie
I really love the song but this video cinematic is outstanding!!
dodie out here speedrunning post delivery (any%)
This is the most relatable song I've heard all my life, and it also hits at the most relatable time it could too. I am speechless.
I'm a simple gal. I see a new dodie song, I click.
omg dodie is postman pat confirmed best news of 2021
I’ve never seen such a crazy like dislike ratio in my life
Firstly, please deliver my post! Secondly, this is wonderful, thirdly WHERE WAS THIS FILMED?! OMG
yaaaaaaay
this reminded me of Klaus/ Kiki's Delivery Service! best!
Love the subtle cuffing
this is a phenomenal music video. the idea to transpose a song about trying to communicate into this gorgous, old-timey, post-mistress story is beautiful beautiful beautiful. and the camerawork is sooo sooo good wtfff
why does this remind me of Kiki's Delivery Service?
Just heard this on the radio tonight as I was driving and I couldn’t believe it! Congrats on the success Dodie 💖 It’s so crazy to hear you on the radio after watching you on YouTube since I was 12! Really surreal
Idk about anyone else but this video straight up inspired me to work harder also amazing as usual dodie ❤️❤️❤️
no pus ta chido :)
dodies music is something else maaannn
This better be the prelude to a TV show!
Beautiful as always, I love how we can always really see bare emotions on your face
i love this music video
Me before watching this:  "Oh maybe I am straight I might not like girls" Me 15 seconds into this: "Yeah no I was wrong" *puts She on repeat*
Why does she hate herself?
living for all the hand shots
Postlady Dodie is so wholesome
Where was this shot? I was convinced it was my old uni town Cornwall 😍🧡
dodie this is beautifull, thank you for your work
Actually beautiful ❤️
Literally never clicked so fast ever
The cat had to be in there ^^
personally i think we all are the cat rn 2:35
Great song, but even a tenth of that level of dedication to not mixing my mail up with someone on the other side of town and delivering it 5 days late is unrealistic.
Love this!!
i’m thriving with this
It's only bloody polperro 👏
Another amazing track from the musical maestro that is Dodie! 😊👍🏻🎶
But what was written in the letters? I don't imagine you picked them back out Edit: probably asked the homeowners to film and took them out after innit
this is so fantastic and i am so GAY
what in the eroda is going on here
Serious Klaus energy with this one. Beautiful song and video, as always!
By far my favorite song from her
what studio ghibli movie is this?
HOW CAN A GIRL THAT SINGS IN LOWERCASE MAKE SUCH A BOP
Skipped chem class for this. Was it worth it? Yes. Yes it was.
dodie!!! this reminds me of that children's story you wrote bean the bug, you amaze me every time
Thank you so much for this dodie 🥺💕
where is this btw? how gorgeous looking is this!?!!
Okay, this is officially my favourite music video of yours so far 🤩🤩
Those dislikes are people who cried and the tears blurred their vision
dodie trains for postal service olympics, gets old lady’s approval and ascends  10/10 would watch again
this felt like a whole movie
This is probably my new favorite video of hers !
i fucking love you
it's modern "Kiki's delivery service" 😍😍
i know this is about a toxic relationship but this is an RSD mood also lol
beautiful <3
Totally worth the wait ...omg pure freakin art ❤️🔥😭
This is excellent, dodes!!! (And ofc props to sammy) its so cinematic!! This and Human (by hazel) are my two fav music videos of yours 😄💙
SO GOOD!! is this filmed at the same place are adore you??
Another dodie B O P!  (video kind of reminded me of 'Adore You' by Harry Styles x 'Klaus' the animation christmas movie (not saying in any way that it is unoriginal, I LOVE IT)
AAAHHHHH this is so good!!!
Omg this is incredible
ITS SO PERFECT 🤚🏼🥵
I hate myself too wow
beautiful and majestic, both the video and the song!! love it!
If only this could be turned into a longer or sequential cinematic experience👍🏻 I’m a fan!
the postal service we need
My new super hero, the "Super postwoman"! LOVE the song , great video.
Where was this filmed? It looks a bit like Falmouth!
y'all can someone smart analyze this
I bumped into this by accident and I actually really like it.
aaaaah this is so cute and lovely!!
I like it quite a lot to be honest with you🤣
smart people, what does this mean??
simply amaaaazinng
When i grow up to be your age... i wanna be just like you.
Love you
God, Dodie - you're so GOOD.
this is me in a song
WE GET IT, DODIE, YOU'RE STUNNING--
Klaus vibes
She be flyin'
POV : You are Dodie best known for your music career but a global pandemic turned you into a key worker.   You  are now postperson Dodie ( gender neutral because it is 2021 g0d)
I love that you always tell a story with the music video , and the partnership between Doddie  and the director was become a trademark. Thanks for this ❤ also , you look incredible with that uniform 😍
the little nope at 0:46
DODIE IM SO PROUD OF YOU
Post woman dodie 😍
where was this filmed?? eroda???
Since we know some of the tracks are connected on the album, I’m just gonna go out on a limb here and guess that the video cliffhanger will pick up where it left off in the next track, I Kissed Someone (It Wasn’t You)?
I thought Conan O'Brien was the DP lmaooo
So so beautiful! Gosh the colors are amazing, does anyone know where that was filmed? Looks like cornwall to me 🤔
The Doddle Postal service ✉️
Amazing as always
me watching this like: yep this is all im listening to for the next few months
Postwoman Dodie.
whatta a beatiful clip!
I was not ready for this aaahhhhhh
I fucking loved that! Amazing as ever dodie. You make a good postie
beautiful. the accent of the whole video :’)  but i dont understand it...?
It’s a great day to be gay✨
postman pat could never
Is there going to be captions available I'm very bad at hearing words in songs or is there going to be a lyric video? I really love Dodie's music and this song is great
YES this is everything i could have hoped for and more !!! this was such a lovely video ahhh dodie out here exceeding my expectations, as per usual :))))
Is that Eroda?
I love yourself 😊
The cutest mail lady I’ve ever seen
postwoman Dorothy and her grey and white kitty!!
❤
here before a million views, fantastic as always
I luv u🥺
omg is dodie the postwoman for eroda
i cant decipher this
bit good dodie
Beautiful and there’s a cat I’m in love.
Sammy said it would be silly. This is the most beautiful silly thing i've ever seen
who knew working at the post office was so demanding
I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what the video means but I love it.
Lovely! Makes me want to re-read Going Postal by Terry Pratchett!
A letter to all those who relates to the title;  I know sometimes you might forget it so here's a reminder. You don't have to do an important things to be important.Maybe you don't have much friends or a nice family. But please remember. Remember the last time you petted a cat, the last time you hold the door for a stranger, the last time you wrote a nice comment, the last time you said "Have a nice day!" to someone, the last time you left a tip, the last time you smiled back to a kid, the last time you liked a comment or post... Everyday you make someone's day, maybe it lastes only a few seconds but you make them happy. You matter.  - A stranger from internet
Sammy did an excellent job on the cinematography! Love those shots, especially that barrel roll on the letterbox and that faraway silhouette shot of Dodie running up the mountain! Brilliant stuff 👍
THIS IS INSANE
eeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEE YES LOVE IT AMAZING  also what where is that :0
She's Dodielivering mail
Postman Dodie Goes To Heaven
that ending oh my goddddd this is b e a u t i f u l
Seagulls. Best background singers.
I MUST KNOW IF THERE IS A DEEPER MEANING BEHIND POSTMAN DODIE.
this song,,, explains how my brain works
Post woman Dodie how amazing 😍
Here's the lyrics video guys https://youtu.be/_8BEFuQcbPM
probably my favourite music video yet, gorgeous from start to finish  🖤💙💚
postman pat looks different here?
Dodie. Sammy. HOW.
if this isn't Cornwall I'll eat my post
AHHHHHHHHHHH IM SCREAMINGGGGGGGG
HUGBEJDNUHE FEELING GAYER THEN EVER
Dodie! This is so great! I love the song, love the video, love it all!! The video gets me amped! It’s a chill amp, though lol. Makes me wanna work out, which is NOT something I ever feel. But the video is inspiring! I love love love it. Totally gonna be on repeat for the foreseeable future. 🥰
I have several half theories as to the meanings of things in this video. Sorting through mail = trying to sort out nonverbal "messages" from the other Trying to get better at sending the mail = trying to get better at expressing the conversations that swirl in your mind "on fire" The fact that she does get better and is in uniform at the end may represent her feeling that she's gotten better at communicating in relationships or at sorting through her thoughts that lead to her hating herself based on the silence of someone who matters to her.  Ooh I think the intense physical training is representative of intense mental training because of having something like social anxiety. Or even just insecurity.
As someone who is usually "the one who goes quiet" but has also occasionally been the "I hate myself" in one of these kinds of dynamics, this song really resonates. The whole idea of building a problem that isn't there, racking your brain trying to parse clues and signs that don't actually exist. My understanding of the video is that it's just about working on more effective, direct communication and how developing that interpersonal skill can be a way to lift yourself out of that anxious place of cyclical thinking (as represented by her elevating out of the dark, dusty post office and into the light at the end). Wonderful song + video.
O my goodness, this is just lovely! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Reminds me of the movie Klaus and I love it
THE ALBUM TITLE DROP AGGHHH YEP YEP
Brilliant song and video amazing and talented Dodie!!! ❤ 🎶
For  a moment I thought you were going to run into Harry Styles
When you need to be at the premier for Dodie’s new song and Ashnikko’s new song but they premier at the same time: 👁👄👁
love this smchhhh
amazing wish i knew wtf it meant 😅
as soon as the credits started and I saw "Sammy Paul" I went "hell yeah !!!"
Dodie's voice sounds like the aural equivalent of drinking a cup of tea
The colour palette of this mv and folklore  by Taylor swift are sisters
These visuals 😍
If this were a movie it shall be called dodie Delivery
my stomach really hurts today.
Adore you looks different here
I feel seen. This song literally describes my current problems.
best mail lady ever
Fun! Love it!
The styling is so cool
Typical postman, didn't knock and left my parcel in the rain.
the ending part is a divine cross between “bittersweet symphony” and a Sufjan Stevens song, anyone feel that?? So good!
The part when the old lady congratulates her got me crying for some reason. I love this 🥰
I think the post represents trying to please everyone around you constantly, it taking up all energy and time as we see in the video.
this is so good thanks dodie
I GOT CHILLS might be one of my favourite dodie songs yet ♡
This was outstanding
The most efficient postal service I have ever seen
genuinely lovely
omg the lyric  ‘one more for the road’ what a tb
I wonder if people watching this video years in the future will remember the 2020 context. Thank you to our mail carriers and other essential workers!
Lyrics:  Could it be different? Did I ruin the day? Oh do you look angry? Oh what did I say?  Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us need Something wrong with me  I'm getting desperate Losing my mind Oh how do we get here Every time?  One will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me  No, I don't think I can help it (No)  Oh so illogical I'm not magical I can't read your mind But how can you not hear The whole conversation I have sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet I hate myself When you go quiet I hate myself  Look at you sideways Playing a game Oh what if I laugh now? I think I'm insane  Filling in the gaps Build a problem that Neither of us need Something wrong with me  Pushing a boundary Something to prove Strong expectation You already lose  Oh one will fold their arms One will do the dance Really is no need Something wrong with me  No, I don't think I can help it  Oh so illogical I'm not magical I can't read your mind But how can you not hear The whole conversation I have sitting still with a brain on fire? I know it's a me thing Eyes closed isn't helping When you go quiet I hate myself When you go quiet I hate myself  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Oh something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear I'm only proving how I'm only worth losing now  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet I hate myself) I don't think they get me, dear  Give me a mystery Maybe they'll bloom for me It's always the quiet ones Something here must be done I'm open and ready here I don't think they get me, dear (When you go quiet I hate myself) I don't think they get me, dear  No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) (When you go quiet I hate myself) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (I don't think they get me) No, I don't think (I don't think they get me) I can help it (When you go quiet I hate myself) No, I don't think I can help it
I’m obsessed with the style of this video! The song is wonderful as always!
Почта России
OKAY THE ENDING THO- SHE DO BE  LEVITATING
A heckin' BANGER plus a lovely directed music video by Sammy and I think this is very on brand for you. So proud of u!
Love it :)
Amazing.
Wowowowow!!!! Amazing video. Fantastic song. Dodie you've outdone yourself 🥰🥰
i just adore how all dodie music videos, while having hugely different plots, have the same aesthetics so they feel united
your music is always so GOOD oh my goodness
Very nice reminds me of Moonrise kingdom movie  :)
the bisexual energy of the rolled up sleeve and cuffs i think i’m in love
Can’t believe this is postman themed! I was literally telling my friend on Friday how I’ve realised my fav niche genre is a guy establishing a postal service somewhere with no post as a punishment, and then this?? Wild. (eg. Going Postal by Terry Pratchett, Klaus on Netflix)
dodie clark. Polperro's finest postal delivery girl.
Postwoman dodie straight up ascended wtf
Is- Is this the same place where Adore You was filmed ? :0 <3
This Song is really good!
New recruitment video USPS
i am,,, not straight
Wait ..is the cat a postman pat reference or am I a child lol
I don’t know what I was hoping for but this song is even better than I dreamed of, I love it 🥺  also if I saw dodie delivering my mail I would pass out
Honestly so relatable I’m crying
postwoman!dodie got me simping even more for her bye--
The last scene kinda reminds me of the Howgarts letters falling on Harry Potter :)  Lovely video for a lovely song, Dodie!
This is gorgeous Wow, dodie took a step further her artistic side once again Wow, just wow I'm amazed
I get studio ghibli vibes from this and now I want a script.
lockdown really made dodie change careers now
paper package on wet ground?? ill have to report you
does anyone know when the full album will be released? i cant fucking waittttttt dammit
the postwoman fit should be the dodie uniform
Anyone else want a whole movie? Lol I mean we basically got one but i wanna see like 2 hours of this
I swear with the quality of this being so high this should easily beat Harry styles and his stupid fish for best music video of the year
time after time, dodie sings to my heart and speaks to my soul through her lyrics, visuals and art. love you!!
I love this so much. Wowowow!
I don't know why, but it's giving me studio ghibli vibes
the fact that she cuffed the pants, a true bi icon
Love it!!! 💛
The Video reminds me of a ghibli movie ! Love it
dodie and sammy have done it again!
i was like AAAAAAA OMG HSABS VQABVIUAA  A A when i saw notification, have a good day
I just was thinking about starting going to the gym and this training montage magically shows up
This reminds me of Jasper!! (Klaus on Netflix)
SHE FLEW
Ahhh this is so good!!!!!!
I love it!! (But don't understand it but that's okay lol)
i don’t know how to describe how i feel after hearing this but i know i feel happiness
dodie in uniform      like if you agree
getting STRONG Violet Evergarden vibes from this music video
THE CAT
beautiful as always
I just I-
Polperro?
Postwoman dodie and a cute lil cat!
giving me Klaus (2019) vibes ♡
This goes on my running playlist! 🏃‍♀️ 😊
me twenty seconds in: is this in english
oh my god that was beautiful
ahhhhhh crap, i missed it, im so sad rn-
The "Adore You" vibes are immaculate
Dodie: says "build a problem" in any one of the songs Me: That's the album title, that's the aLbUM tiTLe!!!
i love the postwoman fit
I clicked for the big mood title, I stayed for the inspirational postal working
💕❤️💕❤️💕
Postie Dodie? I'm confused .. I thought you wanted to be a zoo keeper for the musically insane?
I love this i just really love this im—
category is: Jesper Johansen from Klaus realness
So now I have to write a story about the life of a hardworking postwoman huh. Okay.
now i want to be a postwoman
and of course it’s AMAZING
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH yes
I love how she keeps going, smiling head held high, but the voices don't go away. You learn to live with it I guess.
Your costume was made by Son de Flor! That's so cool!
I thought that she was trying to get into the military.
3:24 🙇‍♀️Excuse me my name is 🧚🏻‍♀️fairy🧚🏻‍♀️  Not human🧍🏼‍♀️or animal 🐶 or fake ❌ just 🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️
not me already on my 4th watch.... what  edit: 5th lol 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th ok imma stop...    it’s just so damn good!!!!!
dodie!! this is so good!! I'm in love with everything about this
That's such a nice song and a nice video !! So great to see Sammy's work and yours together  <3
Oh my gosh this is incredible... I'm trying to move past my habit of attempting to mind read everyone around me and just learn to "put on the blindfold" like in the music video which I think represents not trying to read too much into things and get into the habit of trusting what you're doing in your relationships. This is so helpful for my journey Dodie and as always the tune is so catchy!!
wow i am in love
this is like a dark academia vibe tho
Now come on this is really good music why is it not already on trending?
Dodie *Intense training* Random: "What are you training for? Competition?" Dodie: "A delivery position at the post."
This is absolutely fantastic. Rocky meets Kiki's delivery service lolololol. Love it!!!
give you a like for weird.
DODIE WTF!? You have outdone yourself on this one. 🥺
she don’t miss
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Dodie as an anime main character that happens to be a postwoman, I love it.
YES DODIE I love this so much
Watch out Postman Pat here comes Postwomen Dodie!
trying to manage peoples words and happiness? wow hello relatability how u doin
Oh wow 🥺
She said: POSTIE RIGHTS ✉️📦📨📮
GTFO Postman Pat, Dodie's stolen your job x
SHAWTY???? THIS IS SO GOOD
wait that was so cute
THIS IS SO BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED AND SHOT OOOHHHHH... GOSH. dodie's such a great actress and SHE'S SO CUTE IN THIS VIDEO DKSHDKJD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg practising putting it in the letter box 😄😆
There's no one to work at the post office! Dodie: Fine, I'll do it myself
this is my favorite music video you (and sammy) have done so far :D i love it sm
I love this!!   I interpreted it as the use of the envelopes as containers of words and problems. You're not sure how to not be overwhelmed by the weight of the baggage of them all and then eventually let go. By delivering them to the recipient and taking control of the situation, you learn that words and their weight aren't always your own to receive.
All of us are thriving after watching this music video
Polperro. If I knew you were in Cornwall I'd have said hi! Lovely video, odd but brilliant concept, who came up with it?
I'm a simple person, I see a new dodie song and I immediately click 💕
dodie said let's make delivering mail badass
I love that she got the Dodie dots in the end
fantastic 💕
slowed version on my channel if u want :) THIS MUSIC VIDEO IS INCREDIBLE
absolutely loved this! <33
well i was wrong about it being a police hat lol
Dodie went to mail heaven
People disliking are the letters that got dropped
I have no idea who this is but her live stream popped up in my recommended and holy crap she’s so talented I already stan her
THE  CAT
oh thats why it was physically demanding huh
THIS WAS BEAUTIFULLLLLLL
she do be running and climbing and posting tho
yes
Dodieeeeee have you been watching Violet Evergarden
Tell me why I'm crying over a smol postal woman from a seaside town?
🙌 🙌
dodie dots
A Rocky-esque postal worker montage? I shall dub thee: "Pocky" Send it!  (Loved the video, can't wait for the album! 💜)
Ohh yay it’s out! And it’s so good and catchy!
Postman Dodie Period
Ahhh so that’s where the album name is from!
🥺🥺🥺
THE CHORUS THE HMMM THE LAUGH THE NOPE THE OUTFITS THE POSTMAN dODIE THE SALUTE THE OLD PERSON IN THE WINDOW I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS
I looooveee this music video (and the song of course)
Why does every Dodie song just make me feel like... *SHE GETS IT*
The cuffing of the pants to remind us Dodie is in fact a fellow 💅🏻 is 👩🏽‍🍳💋 (chef's kith)
ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL AS YOUR WORK ALWAYS IS <33333
Can we apreciate the ✨✨✨ postwoman dodie aesthetic ✨✨✨
Both the music and the video were just wonderful! I'm obsessed with postwoman dodie!!
“what’s the story in balamory, wouldn’t you like to know?”
Amazing! ❤️
This is not what i would expect from a song called 'Hate Myself' but i couldn't be happier with it!!
The cat!
I’m gonna need all delivery services to start takin notes
This is A W E S O M E !!! But my question is does she cuff her jeans cause she's bi I really need to know
where was this filmed? it seems really familiar
Oh I LOVE this one
im OBSESSED with her music videos
violet evergarden but make it dodie
This video is so strange and quaint. I love it
absolutely my fav music video u n sammy have ever made <3
I watched 2 times what happens at the end??
2:35 THE CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG (LITERALLY KIND OF LOL)
The vibes are immaculate. SO beautiful and heartwarming and fun. When Dodie rides the bike like that I instantly think back to Tessa Violet's 'Not Over You' mv. Well done dodie, one of your best!
Haaaaa how do you look like that after you just ran 🔥❤️ Love the message of this by the way🥰
BOP
Finally I was on time for a premiere, that was incredible!!!
im so happy I got to see this live! aaaah it's so good<3
sammy's mum's thumbs up > paul hollywood handshake :)
Watched it  five times alr
why is every dodie song that comes out my favorite
Omg I love it
TE AMO, ERES LA MEJOR 💙👑
You and Sammy make the best team, loved this! :)
this video is such a cinematic masterpiece pls make this into a full movie

THE RANDOM CAT OMG I LOVE THAT
unlimited replays sold here🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟 0:00 <3
please, we need post stamp merch!
This is literally what I was doing over christmas. Letter fitting throwback wow
Post woman dodie brings me so much joy
Now that I finally rode the hype train with everyone else, I have to wait for all the smart analysis discussions
This is beautiful!!!! Everything about it is beautiful. Ahhhhh! I love it.
Now I'm be staying up all night thinking and creating backstories and motivation why she wanted to be Postwoman xD
Ahhh this is so good!! ❤❤
I love you dodie.
love love love love
SHE DO BE MAILMAN DOE
when dodie can sing act and dance, and i’m sitting here shoving my face full of clam chowder
Dodie wanting to carry someone else’s baggage is too relateable
Getting some STRONG Eroda vibes. But make it dodie-like...
Reminds me of Klaus 💞
Feels like she is reaching out to make even the smallest thing to her best and tries to make everything perfect so everybody is happy; but in a good, still healthy way. Making everybodyhappy, don't wanting to see anybody sad or disappointed, doing everything that good, so other problems can't shine through to her friends
I never thought I'd see a postal worker-in-training concept music video but here it is and it's incredible
dodie is living my childhood fantasy of being a postwoman!
I LOVE IT SO MUCH 😭💞
Oh dam... I could read so much into this! Alfie! A kind of Harry Potter reminiscence with all those letters tumbling around... and the cap. Not only are you taking control over your life, taking action and addressing (!) issues one after the other, you are the captain, the chief of delivery!
SHE DID IT SHE DID IT
is it just me or is anyone else getting harry styles' adore you vibes from the music video?? 😍😍😍
was this filmed in polperro in cornwall? it was so recognizable to me that I had to ask
this videos color scheme just screams dodie
This song is literally like being in my brain. And I’m here for it ✨ #foreverbuildingproblems
I think we can all agree the real star of this was the old lady
livestream gang whERE YOU AT
Brilliant, as usual ❤️❤️
oh to be a dodie music video~
Awesome dodie!!! 🥰🙏👏🤘
Who watched the live?
😍 This whole video is AMAZING, but the whole time I was thinking "Holy FRICK is that Polperro??? I live so close by, I am SHOOK!" 😮
I’m in love
This is really charming
I love the metaphor in trying your hardest to deliver a message to other people so much :) when other people fall silent and you feel like it's your fault you want to overcompensate in communication really bad (at least that's how I interpreted it)
THIS WAS SO SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL ITS SUCH A COMFORTING VIDEO AND VIBE AND PLACE AGHHHHHHHH
the musicality of this is incredible!!!! i love it so much ❤️❤️
also personally speaking, because I know everyone is asking, my favorite part was the cat cameo
The production quality on this!
Omg that was so good. Definitely my favorite music video ever :)
Dodie should be credited as one of the 'Runners'.  I know I know, I shall see myself out.
She lives with Harry styles on the tiny island of Eroda <3
Ima just wait for other people to do sum analysis lmao
I SEE THE DOC MARTENS AND THE CUFFED PANTS
everything about this is perfect
dodie is pulling through with the serotonin
SO GOOD SO GOOD
i love everything about this WOW
Gives me adore you vibes and I’m here for it
As a long time dodie stan I love her matured music. Probably because I have grown. This is like self deprivation that hovers around you without super weighing you down
YEA YES YES YES YES YES YES
OKOKOK so I think the postman thing is a metaphor for how people (mostly women) are expected to “deliver” what people want ya know?? And I think that represents Dodie’s whole struggle by feeling like she can’t deliver that standard, but I think by the end she realized she didn’t have to be the standard. she’s still delivering, but she’s doing it her own way now? Idk that’s just my interpretation either way this is so cUTE AND THE SONG IS WOAHHHHH 😭😭😭😭😭😭🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🏳️‍🌈
what a cinematic masterpiece YET AGAIN THE DISLIKES MUST HAVE BEEN PEOPLE CRYING AND ACCIDENTALLY MISSING THE LIKE BUTTON
Ahhhhhhh!!!! I love it!! It’s so gorgeous and I absolutely get the “needing to be filmed with sincerity” part of it. It IS really fun. I also wonder if like the song was about “finding anxiety” in things that actually have no reason for it, the video kinda demonstrates the super high standards to which we (obviously Dodie in particular ‘cause it’s her song) hold ourselves to unnecessarily? Except in the example of the video it proves to be a good thing while stressing about how to be The Best friend when someone is just being quiet for themselves is......less than helpful. Anyway! I love it!!
Eroda vibes
I think this was filmed in the Doc Martin village and I am so proud of knowing that  *kind of, if I am wrong please disregard lol
Never misses!
Dodie you did an amazing job!
it’s just SO. FUCKING. GOOD.
same aesthetic as adore you i love <3
dodie: inspiring the postmen and women (and everything in between!) of tomorrow since 2021
the salute is the cutest thing ever
We stan a woman in uniform 😍🏳️‍🌈
Lovely Dodie, Postal Maid... Victory to you! Cheers, James
Welp looks like I’ll be playing this on repeat for the next three weeks. I absolutely adore it, Dodie! It’s lovely🥰
I’d pay extra postage to have dodie be my neighborhood postwoman
good music just comes pouring out of you
dodie trying her hair up is the prettiest thing ever
Okay but can we just talk about *CAT* 😻
Sammy Paul back at it again creating ✨pure art✨
For the people who where in the live chat. We should have a discord.
Postwoman dodie just cured all my sadness
Of course dodie was amazing as always, but also major props to Sammy - the video is a vision and looks so stunning!
IT'S SO FREAKIN BEAUTIFUL I CAN'T EVEN.
Pogg
this aesthetic is so fuccin on point, i wanna live there and try my hardest to be the best delivery woman too
eroda vibes
I can't be the only person imagining this takes place in the same seaside village as the Adore You Music Video and all the townspeople are just putting up with weirdo mail people and fish lovers...
i love this so much but am i surprised
this has mega “delivering the presents” in that christmas movie Klaus vibes!
This video made me emotional?? It's just so beautiful to see someone work so freaking hard and really put in the work for something and then to finally get what they want. I'm an acting major and sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try I'm never going to get anywhere but you just have to keep pushing and remember that the work will pay off
THAT WAS SO AESTHETIC
I love this so so much dodie, you are amazing
Imagine having dodie as your postwoman
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!! yes dodie!!! loved it 10000%
love how this is shot!
What do you guys think it means/the video and lyrics resemble? I have some ideas but i cant put them into words
wow. just wow. it's so powerful and adorable.
now is when I wait for someone to explain the video
Amazing as usual Dodie!! Me and my cat loved the song and video so much!! Keep being you!!
pls it was perfect🥺🥺🥺
**sigh** **hits replay button**
dodie, you absolute fucking legend. ✨
ok but the special thanks to artie the cat ! artie i love u

WOWOWOWOW THAT WAS AMAZING. Props to dodie and the whole team. Absolutely stunning.
that was so well made omg
omg thats so cool! Love u dodie! Also CAT and the woman in the window! (❤´艸｀❤)
watching this made me wish i was a postwoman living in a cottage in a town on the shore
This is why I love dodie so much she never fails to make an amazing song and music video Ily dodie if you’re reading this, and we all think you’re AMAZING
It’s Dodie it’s good
I know that music videos get directed for songs but with this it really feels like the song was written for the music video not with the lyrics but with the music I know that´s probably not the case but it feels like it
wow wow wow wow
"nope"
It was so moving, and such a beautiful story
that woman watching dodie through the window and nodding approvingly at the end is all of us
such a cool storyline i’m in love
I did not expect that honestly
dodie: [Cuffs her trousers] Me: :O
aww dont' hate yourself if there is silence in the room, nothing wrong with silence, just means we are comfortable
OMG THIS VIDEO IS JUST SO AMAZING!!!
Oh my god this is amazing
this video is sooo beautiful and the song is freaking amazing!!! I love it all so much!!! <3
Dodie is one of the few reasons I'm sad that the Brits left the EU!
yeah I don't know about you but dodie was my gay awakening
Yay! I love it! Such a great song! Congrats, Dodie! I can’t wait to hear the rest of the album.
thanks!❤️
i can't put into words how good these mv and song are, it's ridiculous !!! great job!
dodie and her amazing, talented self and her amazing, talented friends have done it again  it's a masterpiece!!!
Everytime Dodie drops a new song I find myself instantly loving it and listening to it on repeat for the next week
So!!! Good!!! I love thisssss
Not dodie  a s c e n d i n g  out of the mortal plane bc she became a successful postwoman
Where did they filmed it? 💛
It looks like Eroda :O
Postman dodie Postman dodie And her black and white dots!

❤️ love.
Wait am I dumb, I still don't get what this video means
Any time Sammy Paul and dodie work together, you know it's going to be amazing ❤
Beautiful, incredible, immaculate. However the act of leaving a package outside someone's door and not even letting them know it's there is a crime against god
Polperro is so fricking cute, it was the perfect place to film!!
That was beautiful ❤️
that hat tip gave me ✨LIFE✨
I love it so much and that postie outfit is absolutely everything 💙💙💙
When Ashnikko and Dodie have simultaneous premiers and now you gotta catch up :p
This is sooo beautiful!!!❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Amazing!! <3
the vibe is truly something different
I’ve never been this early for a video before
getting violet evergarden vibes from this :)
I nearly cried. So bloody proud of you! I want a feature-length film!
SUDDENLY CAT AND omg you carry the burden of other of people and THEN FLOAT??
WOWOWOWOW THAT WAS AMAZING. Props to dodie and the whole team. Absolutely stunning.
the lady in the window though - we stan
dodie my sweet one this was such a cool concept and i will be rewatching for a long time
That was such a vibe glad I heard it on the premiere the album is going to be amazing can’t wait for March 5th <3
That was just brilliant
Sammy Paul is the best.
also shout out to dodie's stamina bc I could never
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!   For me, putting on the hat is taking some control back, which makes it easier to thrive?   Also dodie how tiring was it having to run up all those stairs
Loved it 👌🏼
mail person dodie!!!
I don't think I get it. She's delivering post?
That was like whimsical and cute as hell at the same time
AHHHHH I LOVE IT SO MUCH AHAHBSHJHLJBALHA
OMGGGGGG
Love it. Its, everything , i needed and more.
I LOVE IT
YOU ARE ALWAYS THE BEST!!!
Loveeee
the line that comes to mind when i watch this is “remember your training and just let go” from Let Go, which is related to the overthinking silence message in the song !
There’s just something about postwoman dodie
This ones sick
artie the cat, i love you
YES JUST YES POST WOMAN DODIE TO THE RESCUE✨✨😤
DODES THE POSTIE
She's like Mulan I love her so much

So rocky but make it postman😂💕
Artie the cat!
I got studio ghibli vibes
W O W ❤️💕❤️💕🖤💕❤️💕❤️
Is the mail aspect about organizing others private matters to compartmentalize your own worth? She tries so hard to do her job well but no one expects her to fix it all
ITS BEAUTIFUL
i'm crying for reasons I truly cannot explain
Lovely video for a lovely song
