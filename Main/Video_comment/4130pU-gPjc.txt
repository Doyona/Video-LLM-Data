I’ll never forget Leeds 1st season back in the prem. So many magical moments to look back on.
True Leeds, Dallas we all miss you.
This game was Helder Costa’s finest hour. He was superb this game!
MOT what a game
2024 and I still love watching that 2nd goal by Dallas :D
Which so I can look good
That ball from Alioski! ❤
the wankiest commentator on tele!
Leeds are going up
Wish we still had Dallas playing, what a player he became under bielsa
no fans in the stadium ruined the fact we would have had the greatest away limbs of all time when dallas scored
Anyone just watching this in 2024
I wish Leeds were still like this
Bielsaball at its finest & our morinic board sacked him 😔
Even watching this in 2024 you still have city fans to this day saying they don't have any squad depth or a perfect starting 11😂😂😂😂
Deserved fans this game :/
WE ARE Leeds x
Never mind "how have the done that", what about that through ball to out dallas in. Exquisite.
Thank you for the memories Stuart Dallas, great player, wish you could've gone on longer!
happy retirement to the goat Dallas
Dallas has retired 😢We will always remember this moment
Thank you Stuart Dallas

Lots of wonderful memories Dallas has left for Leeds/football fans. This is up there with the best. Thanks for them Stuart. 🙏❤️

Only one Stuart Dallas
Enjoy your retirement stu 🎉
Back here to watch the highlights following Dallas’ retirement - I will not forget these two goals ⚽️⚽️
Happy retirement Stu, will never forget this game🥹
I miss bielsa
Just here rewatching this following the announcement of Dallas' retirement. A true legend for Leeds, will never forget that goal he scored against City.
Dallas’ second goal that day is up there with the most memorable moments in the club’s history. “He wouldn’t would he?? Stuart Dallas!!That’s ASTONISHING!!!!”
Anyone here after Dallas announced retirement😢 ALAW
Fifa looks very realistic nowadays 😆
Pass by Alioski was sublime 😊
Leeds United needs to get 80 wins
Has anyone else watched this video over 20 times? Bielsa 🙌
Back to remember a time when Stuart Dallas played and conquered
This team was special man.
I miss Bielsa
Just back here rewatching this as we embark on a season in the championship. Sad to see us fall so badly!
Leeds United are a championship club really....Wont be long before they are back at that level.
ALAW
Watching this back.. it was incredible. Still the feeling of elation staying up on the final day ... I have never experienced that before. Wow. As good as it felt, lets not have the same this time guys.
Come on Dallas, do it again I dare you
anyone back to give us hope for the city game MOT!
Looking back at this match and cooper's red card understandable but no card at all for the stamp at 2mins.15secs on the Leeds goalkeeper!!
Stuart DALLAS UNDERRATED.  Them two goals was quality. Lets hope Stuart you help Leeds this Sat 30TH TO AT LEAST 1 POINT THIS SAT OR ALL 3.👏👏👏👏
It's not as though your allowed to kick the ball anymore.overpaid pre Madonna's.i used to love football now it's a game for  girls
If only the fans were in the stadium for Dallas s goal
Gracious Marcelo
ahh coming back to this bielsa what a manager one of the best games i’ve seen under him as well as aston and swansea thank you marcelo well and truly the goat 🐐
Thank you Marcelo Bielsa 💙💛 forever a Leeds United legend
Thank you Marcelo
Man City are trash
And normal order presumes 7-0 Gentlemen if you will MCFC
Never tire of seeing that!
MOT ALAW
The mighty Leeds🤍🤍🤍
1-1 wasn’t a bad result but Dallas had other ideas
WERE MARCHING ON TOGETHER
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ARE LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDS
Great results
cookstown cafu. what a hero
I'll watch this in ten years time and still get the feelings I did watching it live!
That pass from alioski 🔥
Go.leeds
How bad is Jim Beglin. It hurts my whole body each time he speaks.
Best performance throughout the season, to beat Man City away with ten men. And both goals be brilliant.
Shocking referee, but justice was served
Momentum, and what it can means in more than one way, is what this shows.
Anyone else watching these and missing football? MOT
Groundbreaking result - Yet Steve Bruce is still Manager of the month? 🤔
Steriling never even got booked for his challenge on meslier if you see it in slow.motion he stood on his hands ...
My favourite player in leeds
Raphinha got injured
Jesus went in with his leg raised too and was nowhere near the ball, why wasn't he red carded? Bernardo was offside too, Man city got away with a lot...
Wow
Man City lost it in Dallas minute.
Peter Drury commentary is from the world feed signal from Premier League Productions.
As a Leeds fan, who else is looking forward to how F'd up 2021/22 season is going to be?
Super Leeds 😋😋
Good job Leeds United
Nice done Leeds United good job you won against Manchester city because this team is bad
Corrupt ref and 10 players, just shows!!!
Up because of Covid? Blow up at the end of the season? How wrong can Carney be? Two sugars please darling....
Geez that was almost as good as Kazuma's steal!
If you play against the big 6 the ref and var seems to favour them always. Sterling should have been sent of for stamping on leeds keepers arm.
This result shows so much about both teams.  Man City are awesome and got beat by a team that doesn't give up.  This is why we watch and why we are so passionate.
"he wouldnt would he"😂😂
As a Leeds fan I’m still extremely surprised by this major victory. This is the game was sensational and may the ten men of Leeds be blessed 😃
if aston villa could do the same thing with city as they did with liverpool, as a man u fan i would love it
WE CRACKED THE THE NUMBER 1
The team thats spent nearly £900 million on there current squads gonna win the league, wow what an achievement,  dont know how pep does it😂😂😂
Dirty city
I still can't get over this. Leeds Leeds Leeds
Best addition to the prem since they left it! :)
Excuses from man city fans all you hear, if man city had put a 2nd string side out leeds would of murdered you, still say your goal was of side in the build up.
Nobody talking about the red card?  I guess you can't even go for the ball these days if you're not 100 percent sure you'll get it.
Seeing various comments about Leeds being found out next season.Strange as it might sound, the second part of this season has illustrated that it is Leeds who are doing the "finding out" The next two big games against Liverpool and Manchester United will be very interesting !
I am a huddersfield town supporter but what a fantastic game well done leeds (the mighty)
That second goal looks like a premonition of Neymar to Mbappe
Basically the next Pro Evolution commentary recorded right there.
If Grealish was playing Liverpool wouldn't have won
Stones defended badly
Couldn’t beat Peter drurys commentating on this is football PlayStation games back in the day 👌
It's alright but it's knowhere near as good as when Norwich city best Man City when they had all their players injured
Is that really worthy of a red?
Incredible defending by Leeds !! 10 men away at city wow !!
Leeds 👊🏼Leeds👊🏼Leeds👊🏼 MOT —.ALAW
Peter Drury and Jim Beglin, it’s like I’m watching PES
Always strange to hear people shout Torres' name again
In what world is that a red card? The guy caught the ball plain. Not even a foul. I don't understand football anymore
Liam Cooper just isn't a Premier League centre half. He's a championship player at best sad but true.
A red😂 what a joke won the ball
Sterling never got the chance to practise his diving and swimming lessons. Pep swigging on his bottle of Holy water. Well done Leeds...refreshing to watch.
Remember don't kick the football anymore  if your near an oppersition player or you might just get sent off ?
who puts the fake crowd noise on this? it's phuking stupid beyond words!
Done us a favour there not gonna lie leads😂😂😂😂
I’m a City fan but I admire Leeds a lot. A great manager and squad full of talented, courageous and hard working players. For some reason I would love to seem they play in Europe some day.
That's a grab and smash
Losing is a big part of football. As an Under 13s I fell its the performance. We had 27 shots with 7 on target🔥. 11 points to go with a 11 point lead from the rest
This is top notch commentry from the commentator 👌👌 Who is this commentator???
Stunning performance from leeds.weve more than mixd it with the big boys this season.great platform for next season.Dallas is a leeds legend.
Ake started the game and they lost 😡
You have to say Leeds were super efficient. Fantastic finishing.
Watched that many reruns of the second Leeds goal, i had to ask the wife to nip me , i thought i was tripping.
Like a hot knife through butter
Man utd fans be like: "this does put a smile on my face"🥴
only one game on citys mind at the moment
the commentator 💯is fuel for the Match  his voice so Nice ✔️
Stuart Dallas. "stupid buy" "Not good enough for the Championship" "Just a bang average utility player at best" ......2 months away from being named as Leeds United's Player of the season in the Premier league...Now that's how you answer your critics :) This man would grace any team in the world, he rarely gets any plaudits, rarely gets any recognition and yet he can play almost anywhere on the pitch and he does the job just as well wherever he plays. Mr reliable. If he was English people would be raving about him.
Dallas's winner, best commentary since Agueroooooo's winner V's QPR sent the country into absolute raptures lol  :)
Adama Traore vibes
What two incredible goals by Dallas...Leeds can surely play top, top football. I need a sip of Guardiola's water too after watching this game. 10 man Leeds over come the giants of the Premier League.
Just wait till we have some more decent players come in we’re coming for you all mot
Can we just take a moment to remember these words  "He absolutely spanked it"
"He wouldn't would he?"  Reminds me of when Leeds beat Southampton 4-3 from 3-0 down in 2005. Pretty confident it was Peter Drury commentating back then and he used similar words: .................  "They wouldn't dare win it would they Leeds? They wouldn't dare win it! Here is Rob Hulse for Leeds United . . and Hulse plays it in . . . . . AND MILLER'S HIT IT!! EXTAGGERING, they have won it!!!!" Absolutely f***ing love it! Come on Leeds!
Sky Sports commentating is miles better than BT and the fake crowd noises make their videos more entertaining 🔥
When you see pep through ing gloves 🧤
Leeds Gave United a Hope
Leeds deserve 12 bonus points for the fearless attractive attacking football they play. There's a handful of players I would like to see at Man UTD...
Silva was way offside for their goal, should have been 2-0.
Wow I never thought I would see the day where Man City play a game without a paid off referee
Hot Shot Lorimer would have been proud of them two!... Mr Dallas you are gold!
no surprises here
Teams defending with 10 players against Man City in order to delay the inevitable🤫
Aaaaand I benched Dallas last second😭😭😭
Over 1 million players transferred Dallas out of their Fantasy League team in the week running up to the game. Being a very astute Leeds fan, I left him in! 😎
Shity will loose on Wednesday 🤣🤣
Does anybody else here "Dallas is gashing through the middle"? No?
Great way to finish off a great win by nutmegging keeper 👌👌
I feel like I’m playing pes
Going to miss Alioski when he leaves, i would rather ge stayed to be honest.....
how was that a red please someone explain
This Leeds team carry no passengers. The manager makes sure of that and the players make sure too. If you're not prepared to put in a shift for the team you're not getting in the 11 or match day squad. What I like about them is they don't whinge about decisions they just get on with playing for each other. Brilliant
Dallas you good thing!
Last goal was brilliant
How have they done that? We copied what Wigan did to us, simple!
The needless chance practically crawl because boundary complementarily fool pace a new sunflower. adventurous, weak lute
Ferrari Torres might be the best striker in the world right now
So much confidence from commentator  that it wont happen this year and many years to come 😂
Leeds ain’t a team it’s a family the way they fight all game 10 men or 11 men 4 goals down or 4 goals up they don’t stop fighting 💙💛💙💛💙💛
BREAKING: Leeds have ended Man City's three game wins.
Ake is stealing a living at city
That's more like it Leeds. Keep it up and it will be glory days again in no time.
Simon is a happy man 👨
I must be in  another dimension where man city lost and Liverpool won
Drury and Beglin, reminds me of old school ITV champions league nights...
City really does suck
Sky have Peter Dury and Bill Lesley, yet I have to listen to Martin Tyler and Rob Hawthorne for all the big games.
Anyone remember arsenal 8 points clear and list title to utd. It's possible
As a wise gold bridge once said ‘drnnrndenener’
Var is so inconsistent I really want it gone last week George Baldock was 2 footed off the ground poleaxed Tyler Roberts and play goes on yesterday cooper was off,then we have bamford with 5 good goals chalked off var costs teams more than it helps them
Peter drury single handedly been carrying the prem during lock down with his commentary
Lol this is 16th on trending. Leeds played amazingly
fut champs at its finest lol
Can’t stand city but I don’t understand how anyone can question that red card. Could have very easily snapped the players leg in half
I am sooo happy as a Manu fan
Still not sure how that’s a red...
Peter Drury is such a class commentator
A real smash and grab done by 10 heroes from Leeds. Best display of the season ever.
Games gone if that’s a red
Not showing the Leeds celebration at end is disappointing
Marching  on  together  Leeds  indeed
Can we take a minute to appreciate Alioski’s through ball 🤩
Wow all sky highlights were longer than 3 minutes. Oh wait, there's a minute silence at the start 😂
terrible decision by the ref, contact was made on the ball and he was playing for the ball, not a sending off by and stretch. refs today arnt like they were before
Red Card??!! Great tackle for me. Intent of follow through but that's like saying may as well not make the challenge at all and let jesus just run past me with the ball.  All that said.,,, he doesn't even touch jesus 😑
Prince harry shut an oil tap b4 his death no wonder why leeds won
What has happened to football that tackle from cooper was class he got the ball
ahhh classic biased referees bumming city and liverpool all day long. any other team guaranteed the ref wouldn't even show a card and it would be ruled out as a 'coming together'. the win made me so happy for leeds tbh
ALL LEEDS ARENT WE!!! Would have been even better if we werent playing 12 men and got a red card that wasnt a red would have been a proper basketball match instead of attack vs defence but the might stuart dallas cant be stopped most under rated player in the leeds squad
where was the offside for citys goal?? where was the lines??
United are coming to get you
stuart dallas is under-rated
Dallas is a baller 💪🏻👊🏻💪🏻ALAW
if utd win their games in hand they'll be eight points behind city . city won the title in 2012 after being eight point behind utd with six games to go. this season city have six games to go....😏
Ederson and allison are both over rated in my opinion
COME ON btw I’m a lfc fan and hate city
Dear Peter, calm down mate.
Sterling most overrated player in premier league
Lovely through ball too
Love that Leeds ruined Mariners bet
1:47 - didn't touch him, ref. Diving bastard
I thought the moment of silence was for DMX 😬
Well done Leeds! But City were POOR! Sterling especially terrible...asking for 330,00 a week? Not worth half that.
Also it shouldn't have been a red card to leeds,jesus just dived
Im glad to see man city loose
LOVE THAT DEF FROM LEEDS,SIMPLE SENSATIONAL PERFORMANCE, I wanted city to win but def like that shows how good you are love those counters
Definitely a red that tackle...
fair play to leeds they have done the business this season.
Peter Drury is a really good commentator ngl
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
Jesus and ranoldino both rubbish players,  they need to go.. pep has not allowed aguero to play instead got these clowns on
Is that's the Irish commentator from RTE or virgin working for sky now?
Leeds united are a bit like sheffield united when there got promoted teams will figure them out next season
Sky sports, minute silence for the Prince, puts fake crowd noise in post edit. Slow hand clap 👏
Start of man city 6 home defeats leeds beat the new champions with ten men
I still don’t understand the refereeing this game. Sterling should have been sent off twice for following through when missing a tackle. Studded Raphinhas ankle and Melliers wrist. Shocking refereeing. Same with Cooper being sent off, he won the ball and clipped Jesus, didn’t even hit him in the knee as many city fans were claiming. Terrible decision to send him off considering he didn’t even really make much contact on Jesus. I understand the “what could have happened” if he had caught Jesus properly but the simple fact is he didn’t. If he wanted to cripple him he wouldn’t have missed.
Yet again some more bullshit from VAR- football is getting ruined
A rare occasion as a United fan I’m happy to see Leeds win. Great to see a historical club beating a new money club.
Great win Leeds , Sergio aguero not even on the bench, coming to Leeds next season !!! Great player glad he wasn’t playing might have got a bag full of goals !
City will still win the league
That challenge wasn't even a yellow, he played the ball and got it, the diving screaming wimp got him sent off😭
RIP PRINCE CHARLES 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Sit back, sip your water and watch a masterpiece pep.
Playing against 12 men and an extra sat at Stockley Park and we still win. Sky commentators were gutted as well.
Love the fact they had a minutes silence for DMX 😇
Dallas is so underrated
48 year old leeds fan here,most of that long suffering. Of course the city result was great,city changed alot of their team And it destabilized them.just like the draw we got against a very good chelsea team its the character of this leeds team that makes me so proud.i just want us to consolidate in the prem first then slowly build our way  up the league.of topic i dont get people with 2 teams? I mean as bad as we been in the past i was never tempted to support another team as well.real support is your club picks you, your town your club,through thick and thin.great win lads marching on together.
At this point, zinchenko and KDB should wear different colour shirts
Post dortmund traumatic disorder is very clear in this match
There’s something so satisfying about watching a team go and grab the ball out the net to restart when you know they lose
Oh yes Irish Guy, the tattoo is coming. Get ready.
That was never a red
City a one man team. KDB running that side. average without him.
We are so proud we shout it out loud we love you Leeds Leeds Leeds
DALLAS!
COME ON WEST YORKSHIRE WHITES
Wish Peter drury was actually commentating yesterday, Jesus Christ, that woman who did the game would give a migraine a headache with her pointlessly obvious non stop drivel.
Dallas. What an engine!
Better commentator than Martin Tyler
And I'm watching it again 😅
The grandstand camera is too far from the field
End of day Stuart Dallas is absolutely unreal and u all know it
Bull. the city player went in half hearted and backed off and only clipped the ball causing he's leg not to follow through and in turn planting his leg earlier than if he actually properly went for the ball and followed through. he would not of been caught. He shat it end of. Never a sending off
How many accumulators were fucked by 2.30 haha
Manchester Citys Defence Is Even Worse Than Moreno.. Step your game up!
RIP dmx
Leeds are trash but he got the ball ⚽️
Well done Leeds from David Forest fan That tackle that got Leeds skip sent off was tame if you look at how they used to in the 70s lol foot was a bit high but not a red for me these always look worse in real time cause of the speed of the players etc but it is what it is and it kind of worked out in a warped way Leeds took Patrick B off and they end up winning the game and the moaners who know nowt about footie saying Pep got it wrong blah blah blah every one of those City players is an international at some level and they had 29 attempts on goal Leeds rode their luck and won the day not many do that at the Etihut lol
Never a red card ... I few years ago not even a yellow card .. the game of football is played by actually pussyholes . VAR has killed the game
Commentator is creating an illusion. It wasn't that good and teams will beat Man City, not buying into what he was talking about.
Harsh red card for Cooper he won the ball. The mighty whites march on . Incredible result and Dallas is so underrated
I hate Drury's habit of YELLING the name of everyone who has a shot. Worst commentator ever.
god i have to say that leed  have improved
Phenomenal.
Gotta love the fake fan crowd background haha
Nice to see a minutes silence for DMX’s death
Bet the ref is gutted.
leeds beat a top class team  who manc will win the prem ALAW good luck manc dont let the scum catch up
I know Dallas will get the plaudits but what.a.ball from Alioski.
Man United fans will be like _"Yes! The title race is back on!!"_ (Disclaimer: I'm a United fan.)
This commentator doesn’t have a clue what he is saying half the time does he?
Great finish for the 2nd.   And can I just thank Pep for leaving Dias on the bench as that means Dallas goes into my fantasy team 😁
money can't buy u titles.... oh wait it can
Never a red
how is the red card a red card when fernandinho clears raphinha out when hes through on goal and its not even a yellow
bernado silver was offside ?
Varchester city trying to cheat their way to a win like they did with Dortmund, not working this time 😂😂😂😂
Jon Richardson will love this
Well done leeds
Imagine the thousands of body’s flying around in the away end 😍
When did getting a clear tackle with the side of your foot become a red card! Is this football or ballet? Football is dead! I won’t watch this farce again, until men start playing it again and not snowflakes!
Comments section: Peter Drury commentary
New Spurs youtuber! Check out my take on Kane Leaving! Spurs fan here and I appreciate any support shown! Thank you
Amazing result! Absolutely stunned but pleased as punch! 😄
**Dallas has possession** Ederson: why do I hear boss music?
How does Edison get a 6 for letting in the only 2 shots he saw all day?
It's a funny old game, we normally have all the possession and all the shots and lose some of these games, today we had no possession and no shots and won the game. In bielsa we trust.
Stuart Dallas, one of the most hardest grafters there is.
Terrible red card, it was barely a yellow
Questionable sending off. VAR only gave it because Leeds were winning and the F A can't have that against Man City. Filthy football.  It's a 50:50 and he played the ball, which is more than the City player could do. Why is the City player not wild?
10 men Leeds stun Man City,Dallas the man with a superb winning goal capping off his his opening goal with Leeds first attack.....
Two sides, who barely know how to defend.  Magnificent football from both teams. Mutual respect of each manager from the other.  Lots to learn by the rest of the so called Premier League.  Only Spurs and Liverpool could hope to get to this level of entertainment.  There is hope for real football from their lead.
Great result despite an apalling referee display, Cooper gets a red but sterling gets nothing, criminal
Leeds always put up a fight against there opportunity's 👏 to Leeds and im a man united fan
You watch this match and WONDER how the hell City are top of the table!! They came out and played about 50% effort today! Disgrace!
Nice they had a minute silencer for DMX..
Games gone soft
City fans be like..😿😿😿😿
Another Peter Drury masterclass
I love Leeds now...how bout everyone else?😎👊🏻
@2:54, what a pass from Ezgjan Alioski. Nicolas Pépé is fuming right now.
2:24 😂😂😂😂
Mate that ball from alioski 🤯
I really don’t like Leeds but fair play, what a win that is
Never a red card. Jog on.
Although it’s impossible for Liverpool to win the premier it’s nice to see city loose 😂
I haven't felt so alive in over a year, but after watching this game I could have taken on Man City by myself!! Get in Leeds!! MOT!
Man City are to focused on the champions league that is now effecting their game
This commentator is so predictable and cringey screaming the full name of whoever shoots.
🤣🤣🤣
Peter drury > Martin Tyler
He wouldn’t would he. Brilliant from peter dury, best commentator out there at the minute.
Why say the score in title
There's only one Leeds United win of the season
Love the PES commentary 😂
The only thing worse than canned crowd noise was Ederson’s goalkeeping 👀
It's official, English football is the softest in the world, never a red card.
Amazing result, very unexpected from a 10 man team to the current leaders.
Well done. Play crowd noise over a minutes silence.
That was Harsh, never a red!
Thx good
finally, ever stopped sleeping on stuart dallas
Leeds: What a team.
this is a great commentator, not like another one where I fall asleep
Stones is soooo shite recently
The game is getting a joke can not even tackle anymore. Soon it will be a no contact sport with no heading 😡
Both Leeds and Crystal Palace had a 100% shot taken to goal conversion rate today. Now that's true efficiency.
This was such a entertaining game and I’m a city fan, i have to say though stones did a great job today but city just couldn’t beat the better team
JUSTICE Leeds win under 10 men thanks to that biased referee! This win is just beautiful 🔥
Leeds inadvertently playing the right tactics against a top side by having a man sent off. Forced to defend and play on the counter rather than pull their pants down as per usual.
This has made my day thank you Leeds
2:15 screams of pain from meslier. Well not his kind anyway
Minutes silence for DMX 🤜🏿
The Cookstown Cafu strikes again
I swear that's fernadinho finished.
Finally a good commentator 😂. Tyler when when that went in would be like ochhhhhhh it’s erm bundled in by Dallas and Leeds win yay. When will they Pay me more ffs
Nice of them to have a moments silence before the game for DMX!
I took 25/1 for Leeds to win with minutes left to play.
This is Leeds United first season in the Premier League & they are doing brilliant.
Man city preparing for their loss against Dortmund
Wow
Leeds Leeds Leeds
Love you Leeds MOT
Leeds leeds Leeds 🤍🤍🤍
Scored in Dallas minute
L loop by n km
Guardiola vs Bielsa ✔️ 10 men ✔️ Away win at the league leaders ✔️
Leeds have the best record in terms of points against city this year 🤯
I really love Leeds how they play even with 1 man down, is that a red card? He won the ball though.
I bet on Leeds to win when city scored to make it 1-1 😅😂😂
United can put the pressure on tomorrow 8 point gap!! Lets mek em sweat!!! GGMU
That assist for the winning goal was all technique
Never liked Leeds United.  But this win I really enjoyed. I've enjoyed watching them this season
The one time they use var of course in a city match
Brilliant Leeds from Glasgow rangers fan 🇬🇧😁
VAR IS KILLING THE GAME
Love that minute silence for dmx at the beginnings. RIP DMX.
Who else had Dallas on their bench in fantasy premier league?
Rip dmx. Good riddance Phillip
With aguero putting away the plentiful chances created next season Leeds will b challenging for europe. MOT
da faaaaaaaaaaaac
Sending off was harsh.
Amazing commentary
The Streets Will Never Forget Raphinia
Lol but the mighty wolves beat ya mate haaaaaaa
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK?" BY PROFESSOR WALTER VEITH POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH YOU TUBE FROM SOUTH AFRICA ENJOY 🙏🏿❤️💯
Desperately need new commentators, jeez this guy is awful.
WHAT A JOKE..
Fun fact in 1841John Neely Byran named the city of Dallas in the U.S. state of Texas after a future Northern Ireland and Leeds united Legend Stuart Dallas. Almost 200yrs later Dallas would score 2 goals in a 2-1 win over city it was written in the stars
After the game Guardiola said that City didn't create enough chances.  You had 29 shots at goal mate, I'd struggle to get that playing on Beginner on Fifa.
Man City 1-2 Leeds  Man City 29 shots - 7 on target Leeds 2 shots - 2 on target  Man City got FM'ed
Come on Leeds
Sorry, but at this point in the season aren't we supposed to be running out of energy. Definitely our day and don't those players deserve their luck. MOT
Leeds are better than inconsistent Arsenal
Super LEEDS ! ALAW
City aren't fazed...They're gonna win the prem
They will flop the champions league aguero was supposed to stay until they win it 😂🤣
Never a red card  referee and VAR are crap, Cooper played the ball and won the ball.
I miss when getting the ball meant yellow card at the worst.
I love this commentator
Where's the Fernandinho assault?
Sets up nicely for Koch & Llorente next couple of games 👊😁🤍💙💛🤍
2 shots 2 goals..... last time I seen shooting that lethal from Dallas it was at the top of a bookstore
Leeds player clearly won the ball there. That's the risk football players take and why they get these wages. Im Losing faith in var everyday
That red card was a joke, he clearly took all of the ball.
Never showed the challenge on Leeds at the end which should also have been a straight red...biased reffing yet again.
Leeds only had two shots  haha
Mate, just give it to leeds for having the bigger bollocks on the day!!!!
jim beglin  ❤️❤️ yet sky stick with Martin Tyler
If every team in the Premier league used Leeds approach then it would b a better league, hates seeing teams just sitting back, go for it, that's y Leeds are a good watch might not win every game but there always great to watch
Never a red btw
Talk about taking your chances for Leeds great result will give them a huge confident boost that will as for City I'm glad your were beaten.
Its the fact that Bamford predicted this !!
RIP all who benched him on FPL 😂
So, no showing of the challenge Raph that should have been a red, how typical!
29 City shots to Leeds’ 2...
Credit Leeds. That red is a joke though, can you not even challenge for a ball anymore? Also, Jesus was holding his head and he wasn't even touched there.
Is it just me or did that last goal feel like we had just won the Premier league MOT 💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
He got the ball why is it a red pathetic
Dallas gets 2 goals wow
This is the best season Dallas has had since the Who Shot JR cliff hanger.
Here’s an example of when underdogs beat big teams     Edit: I suck
On behalf of all last man syndicates around Britain we would like to thank pep for this 👍🏽
BEAUTIFUL DAY
Biased or bought ref, the decisions we disgusting, ref still couldn't find a way to give Man City the win though.
Goosebumps  Awsome result  Dallas n.i loyal
simply stunning
Leeds have dominated a fair number of teams and still lost so this is overdue payback
Fc UK this game. No red card. Bunch of puss ies. What a cheating.
The entertainment that Leeds have brought the Prem - fantastic
“He wouldn’t, would he?” Boy that makes me smile when
unrealistic unt fans: tHe tItLe raCe iS bACk On
In John Stones' position, I would have easily  taken a card, I wouldn't mind the colour.
The rest of the premier league v man City with 11 players : L' s  Leeds with 10 men : W   Ahh So thats how to defeat them 🤔 .. Bielsa the genius has done it again !
Nathan Akè come back to Chelsea.
Let's all laugh at city 🤣  👇👇
Never a red the game is gone.
Leeds are really entertaining to watch
The 130 dislikes are shitty fans crying
This is why I love Premier League. Stuff like this happens xD
I rate the minute of silence for Dmx
Like to see noel Gallaghers expression =🤔😒
I know Dortmund players had their eyes on this game like “👀”
The Cookstown Cafu strikes again!! Met Stuart a few times and he's a gentleman as well as a hell of a player, just wish he would do that more in a green shirt. GAWA
All that billions Man City have spent and yet they can’t find a decent strikers.
City are rubbish
drury and beglin, the yorke and cole of commentary
250 to 1 too win
Drury = GOAT of GOATs 🐐
Sterling is so greedy ngl
Great result. Guessing they would of loved it against Man Utd that little bit more.
What a win for Leeds 😮
Pep looked like he'd seen a ghost when that second went in! What a confidence boost ahead of Spurs, Liverpool and them lot from the other half of Manchester
Always harder to play against ten men, don't ask me why....it just is.
2:25 Sterling is a rat
No one talks about the terrible refereeing!
and stones wants to be the a 1st choice centre back for england, lol
Peter Drury and Jim Beglin are the greatest commentary duo ever.
never a red card.
my mighty leeds hav waited a long time for this! im 63!!!! super leeds
Wtf is city's keeper doing for that goal shocking why on earth is he running out .
Leeds born and bred who is better than Leeds I think nobody
Win a ball cleanly and get sent off , pathetic and I'm a Coventry fan .
I just hope we can hang on to this squad and coach for next year and build; really solid first season back in the top tier. Should finish in 8th I think. Great result and attitude. MOT.
The look on Guardiola's face is priceless!🤣
What's with the stupid crowd noise! Pointless and detracts from the game
I've never rated stones, he is bang on average
Marcelo Bielsa Definitely deserves credit for this, Leeds defended incredibly. And Stuart Dallas is so underrated he has a lot of goals for a left back. And Raphinha was a constant threat on the counter and Kalvin Phillips was immense
Nice one Leeds!
Congratulations leeds for beating us. How boring is football when you continuously win, win and win. With this loss, it’s a motivation to beat the next team in our fixtures. Every team ain’t perfect. A loss is not the end for us. So enjoy your moments for today haters.
Hilarious kris Boyd said Leeds can’t defend will get destroyed the beat the so called best team in the world at home with 10 men for the whole of the second half what he knows about football can put in on a pin
It's safe to say this is the result of the day. Whether you hate leeds or like leeds you won't get a dull or  boring game. Can't wait for fans to return. Football is nothing without fans.
Fraud Guardiola says they didn't get enough chances which is comical they should've had 2 players sent off!
I said Leeds will beat City after Man City beat us Leicester City.
No crowd, no home advantage.
"There won't be a win like this, this year or for many years" There's literally been loads of crazier wins this season!😅
How was that even a card? Never mind a red card?
The emptyhad the emptyhad
Leeds take the lead haha get it
The biggest news in years is city losing at home with a 14 point lead.....they are in the caraboa Cup final,FA Cup semi final and carry a 2-1 lead into the champions league quarter finals......
Wonder was miss carney watching.
How many players actually felt sad about the prince
Why did stones not take him down. Just take one for the team
Rip Prince philip
Fair play, Leeds doing a Sheffield United this season. It’s amazing what a virus can do for your club 👏
What a through ball.  Absolutely brilliant!!
Big Stewarty dallas just a wee man from Cookstown
Some how if possible made better by Peter drury’s glorious voice!
I am sorry but other than dallas give Meslier some respect as I saw nothing about him in the comments yet he's been amazing this season with some very impactful saves honestly one of the best goalkeepers this season imo and I only see him improving.
Sterling had lots of chances but he couldn't convert them. Also he hasn't even scored for 7 weeks.😬😂
We are Leeds we are proud 💙
how tf was that a red
That red card was a disgrace. Baldock took Roberts out  in sheff utd game not even a yellow . Super leeds mot Dallas player of the year at elland rd again . Superb performance from a team who cant defend . 3 wins on the bounce 😍😍😍. Watch us next season . We are back with a BANG
Hail Dallas Hail Bielsa Hail 10 men Leeds
Give those Leeds players and bielsa the credit they deserve... incredible
Leeds have gotta be favourites to win PL now surely
Yesterday sadly it was announced the passing of DMX and today leeds showed city who was going to give it to them
Can’t spell Dallas without b2b Ls. Next one vs BVB
'Alioski, Dallas is dashing through the middle here for Leeds, he wouldn't would he?! STUART DALLAS, THAT'S ASTONISHING'
“Dallas is dashing through the middle here for Leeds - he wouldn’t, would he - Stuart Dallas , that’s astonishing!”. Has to be the quote on the mural this man surely deserves.
Feels so good to be a leeds fan this season
As a Man Utd Fan I Wish we played like Leeds man
That was never a sending off. Disgraceful decision.
Leeds like Sheffield will have one good season then get relegated the next year
Looks like im gonna be a Chelsea fan again :)
29 shots for Man City 2 shots for Leeds Utd  Patience is key for Leeds
That red card was a joke It wasn’t even a yellow. Why can football be like it was in the 90s
How is that a red card I give up on today’s football so soft
This eleven should never never play as a starting 11 again. CTWD 😎
0:55 what a pass 🔥
Love that minutes silence for DMX 🌹
Pes commentators
Why don’t these pricks put the time in the corner?
Leeds have being so consistent this season.  in their style of attack is the best form of defence well done big game and result.
Beating Leeds isn’t for everybody 🤣🤣🤣
This is awesome
Man city had 29 shots and scored once, utd had 2 shots and scored twice! The amazing leeds utd, come on leeds!
🤐🤐🤐🤐🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Must say alioski pass was perfect for Dallas
Not even city fan Marriner could spoil that...!
Dallas must be the most improved player that’s ever been in football..2 years ago he was worth 1.5m he must be a 25m player now
City always gas out nearly at the end of the season
Its leeds again !😎 Cool as ever,what a great addition to the premier they are .
Money talks, Man city or PSG for the so called  Champions league 😭 if I remember not long ago in football terms, Man city playing at Macclesfield in the league. Somes  it up really.
Man city killed themselves there got so frustrated after Leeds defended with 10 men behind the ball in the box...you need to keep you composure in those circumstances.
That ball from Alioski was so sick
Always happy to see the underdogs win, its even better when its against man city 😁😁
We love leeds
Hahaha well done leeds beating oil money fc
Sterling turned into prime Werner today, shocking!!
What a ball for the last goal btw
There will not be a win like this win this year or many years. Bloody hell. Good win but a bit of an exaggeration
So stamping on someone's hand isn't a red??
Ref did his best to aid City, fair play to Leeds, well deserved 👏👏
City need a proper striker. Playing without one has worked for them most of the time this season but surely they can get a striker who can be a striker and fit peps system. In the second half, other than the torres goal which in my opinion wouldn't have went in if the keeper hadn't slipped, City never looked like scoring.
Lol
Cookstown Cafu!
We are Leeds.
nice couple of points in my fantasy team for dallas thank you very much. also pep please play KDB more becuase he was my captain. probs for the best too thanks.
Sterling is like that arrogant kid at school who thought he was the best and hogged the ball.
So Man Utd beat Leeds 6-2. Man City lost against Leeds 2-1. Man Utd beat Man City 2-0. Man Utd is red? I think so.
Great result for Leeds!  What drama.  Good to see them doing well.  - Sheffield United fan.
That commentator is simply amazing
Im no Englishman but if Gareth Southgate selects John Stones for the Euros im going to punch him up
Cmon moylesyyy
Also, while I'm ranting, is that Phillips jogging casually back leading up to their goal. whoever it is needs a kick up the hole!
Dallas is making Northern Ireland proud
Should of done a Fede Valverde at the end stones
a massive congratulations to Leeds.
V.A.R.=J.O.K.E.
Good tackle from the Leeds player ! Never a free kick never mind a red card ... this ref had City on too win ... lol unlucky shity fan
Nice to win one off the back foot. Leeds Leeds Leeds!
City fans 🤡
One of them games ur buzzing abt without it team in it
Come on the mighty Leeds 🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Fair play to Leeds
Leeds only had 2 shots all game and made them count with 10 men🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥United forever, stand fourth and be counted oooohhhhhsssssshhhhh
Best result of the season so far!! Buzzing
Hmm I give you 3 guesses to what England are gonna win with pickford,stones,Maguire as our main defence this summer, congrats to Leeds what a team perfomance all heart ❤
I just wonder what Cooper is supposed to do there, if he doesn't use his foot to get to the ball fist and win it cleanly is he supposed to use his knee...his head???? He clearly takes 100% of the ball and that was 100% his intention, yes there's minimal contact after but they're both going for it, it's a 50/50. 10 years ago that wouldn't have even been any sort of freekick.
Little peek of Man City next season😉
The fact that that’s a red card is beyond me
Well deserved win for Leeds I suppose, all I have to say is well played Leeds
Great game ,shame about the shocking Commentary on BT Sports again ,
Oil money cant win u everything
RIP Prince DMX
Leeds superb team spirit and most exciting football . Bielsa deserves the manager of the year in my opinion.
Wtf was that red😂
Not a red card. It was an honest challenge and he got the ball. Dangerous, but not intentional. It was a yellow.
I know it doesn't matter now but it looks like Bernardo is well off side for City's goal and even he has  a couple of looks at the linesman before he celebrates. Do those incidents all get checked at the time?
Brilliant performance from Dallas comes up in the important minutes..
Leeds 2 shots 2 goals
FUT Weekend League in real life
1:29 = 50/50 challenge, Leeds player gets the ball, but gets sent off because Jesus rolls about on the floor. Wtf is the modern game
Credit to Leeds but having watched the game live these highlights do no justice to city tbh. Leeds always great to watch tho.
R I P DMX
If this was football manager....  Step 1. Take screenshot of post game stats Step 2. Quit game without saving Step 3. Post pic with stats and Moan about how the game is broken or cheats on forums, Reddit, etc
Wasn't even a yellow. VAR needs scrapping
good win but who cares  city won the league 2 months ago
The Prince would have loved that winner. RIP
Var is a joke snowflakes
For me it wasn't a red... He simply kicked the ball away and I don't think it was reckless tbh. A yellow maybe for committing to the tackle but nothing more for me.
Dallas is one of the most underrated players in the league!
Stop cutting the celebrations short ffs
Haha 😄 🤣
Who else is watching this over and over again
Why’s no one talking about that through ball from allioksi jeeeeez
Quadruple means nothing if you can’t beat 10 Man Leeds. City are a revolting football club. You can’t buy heart. Love it
Dallas hats of from West Belfast 🎩👍🏻❤️
All credit to leeds for this win it's tough enough to win at money bags with 11 men let alone 10. Well done.
Imagine the scoreline if they still had 11 men..
Fifa in a nutshell
Fernandinho and stones were class but in need of a top class finisher to finish off chances
Delighted for pep that’s what happens when you leave players like that on the bench and play the match like you’ve won it before it even started
2 shots 2 on target 2 goals.   Madness
It's great to see Leeds United back in the Premier league and holding their own against the bigger and more dominant clubs and that win was daylight robbery and made more exciting by passionate commentating. Arsenal fan since 1974.
Leeds don't just play, they fight. Phenomenal team 💪
This is why we love football.. Because there is always that one team that no matter how good your playing in a season there's that team you can't beat and they are well below your standards of quality of football haha brilliant
Not even a Leeds fan, but absolutely screamed the house down when Dallas scored at the end - mad scenes 😂
I dunno, but I reckon the Ref got that right the first time
How about that I had Dallas all season in my fantasy football team took him out last week and what does he do but score 2 goals, same happend at start of season with spurs and Son, I took him out and he scores 4 against West Ham following week
FFS you'll get football stopped with that sending off
2 shots 2 shots on target 2 goals
That’s astonishing the ultimate steal!
Peter Drury commentating makes everything better
Were boring aren't we, and don't forget the burnout as well! MOT
MOT.. I JUST WISH WE WAS NOT HELPING THE RED SIDE OF SCUMCHESTER OUT
Never a red should not have  even been a yellow great tackle.
I’d have a player like Stuart Dallas in any team. Just like James Milner, Mr Versatility! What a player 😍
Dallas is a god
I ❤️ Stewie Dallas 😂😂🤟🤟
Game of Fifa this one
Fine commentary replacement for Martin Tyler there
Brilliant commentating, awesome from leeds aswell.
Had to turn the volume down because of the idiot commentating
Need Peter for man United vs Spurs... he would spice up the game ❤️❤️
For all those games we've dominated and got nothing. This is nice
City 🤮😂😂
“He’s absolutely spanked it”. Comments on Kyle Walker and his 18 year old tonight.
He wouldn't ,would he ?
God I hate Peter drury
I bet 2 Dallas on Leeds win!
Bielsa showing the world what a real master tactician is
That outside of the boot pass at 3:06 from Alioski for Dallas' winner was sublime. Bends it around Stones right into his path
3:05 peps face 😂
Yay stones will be great in the euros
LOVE TO SEE IT
VAR did their best
They did it...
Great win leeds  you done yorkshire and the city proud
nobody talking about the keeper? Kept us in the game and if it wasn’t for a slip, we might of not even conceded. Made some crucial saves very underrated in my books.
Stuart Dallas I love you, you may have just saved my fantasy mini league title challenge
All 80 of city’s fans came to dislike
"He wouldn't would he"? Well Dallas boy did!!
Man city were not clinical enough. Almost 30 shots only one goal.
not a leeds fan but that's a joke of a red card ffs
That commentator is bloody awful 🙄🥱
Thumbs down for the PL succumbing to another non football cause .
Best game of the season by far!
the league is so corrupt with VAR anything to keep the Manchester teams relevant and has the upper hand no matter what
I got rid of Dallas and and bought + captained Sterling in fpl on my wildcard.  Showing my tactical prowess as always
Why does everybody hate on our club, You act like man city is the only club that has oil money.  Why are you so damn toxic towards man city ffs
Where's the minute silence for all the people who have died of covid.
GAWA
Now all United need for the title is to win their remaining games and hope 3 other teams turn up to city like Leeds have done today and take all 3 points but I doubt it as only them, United, spurs and Leicester have had the bottle to do it so far
Got to say Leeds have been fantastic this season, I predicted they would have a good season. Always watching out for their results each week & so happy for there long suffering fan’s. I am a disillusioned Newcastle fan, by the way....Come on you Leeds 😄
ALAW‼️
Stones' defensive liabilities are starting to show again...
Would be a shock if anyone actually found City relevant
I don’t see that incredible pass from Alioski getting any credit that it deserve s
We can only hope this affects city into ucl so they drop out
They send off the Leeds guy for playing the ball but catching the City guy with the follow through, so how about Sterling on the Leeds goalie?
As a man united fan I'm delighted
Dallas has been a tank since the qualifiers for Euro 2016 absolute Engine
The son can never beat the mast Arteta couldnt beat Pep. Pep couldnt beat Bielsa.
YEEES! No pressure Man City, none at all. 😉
love the enthusiasm of the commentator
If ONLY united didn't draw those games man ffssss Title would have still be on ot atleast interesting at this point
Last season Liverpool were 600 points clear and lost to Watford...
And you lot were saying we'll get relegated 😂 Stfu. DIRTY LEEDS!!!
Dallas us my player of the season and very underrated
That pass for Leeds' 2nd goal. Beauty
The main commentator was the one that commented the World Cup final
It’s ok, we’ve still won the league🤡😂
Sterling is one greedy little bastard
Get in 🤩
Stuart Dallas proving that he’s better than Andrew Robertson this season...
Man city resulting from shots outside the box and putting in box everyone time they went on attack . Hope they get knocked out in against Dortmund
Man City nears relegation zone
Imagine  how excited Peter Drury gets when he opens socks for Christmas..... "It's a real unwrap and grab, there will not be another present like this for many years to come, or any years" end quote.
Title race back on
Leeds are a very surprising team and no not a fan but good win especially when down to 10 men
Surely Southgate has to call Dallas up now
Beautiful.
Leeds only delayed the inevitable 🏆
Pep deserved that for f”cking up my fantasy league this week🤬😔
Why don't sky sports take that commentator and replace Martin Tyler?!
this ref and all from the premier league are imbecils. he gave a red card for something that was not even a foul. the man city player had a lot of time to protect himself, the leeds defender was faster at the ball with at least one meter. where is this game going if now they sent off players for kicking the ball?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 beating Leeds isn't for everyone
RED CARD?! are u crazy do me a favour
Amazing match. 1 man down against the best team in the premier league and came away with a win. Fighting spirit at its best there!
Why TF is no one talking about how good marcelo bielsa
What about dmx? No silence for the big dawg
I'm sick of seeing Sterling being selfish in front of goal, comes of as desperate and is detrimental to the team.
Dallas my player of the season
The faux 'excitement voice' this commentator puts on is just hilarious.
Guardiola out
That red card reminds me of the red card for thiago silva last time
Man Utd fan here. Well done Leeds that was good
Could never be man utd, losing to Leeds how embarrassing, were winning prem
Ridiculous red card
Wow 2 shots and 2 goals
This is fifa 21 summed up in one game lol
Leeds in the prem just hit different
Fck man City cant beat the mighty Leeds United mot
Thank you Leeds for coming back to the premier league.
Red card was ridiculous, ref had a really poor game
Fck man City cant beat the mighty Leeds United mot
Two late winners in one day, TRENT AND DALLAS 😍😍
I would like to take this chance to thank Leeds for making my raphinia upgrade.  What a waist of coins that could have been 😂
This will be a special date Day to Remember
East win we need to get a hard match soon
Hahahahahahahha
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 John Stones 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HE'S ABSOLUTELY SPANKED IT
Honestly, it doesn't matter if City lost, they're still gonna win the league
He wouldn't would he!
the effect and atmosphere that commentary can bring is really shown here, in the last goal especially
imagine the atmosphere if it had the fans for Leeds🤩
Why was the commentator so hyped, its not as if it was an important win...
Leeds are too good. MOT 💙💛 challenging for Europe next year or even Champions league 👀
nice one Leeds
why did pep underestimate leeds?
Leed are destroying this season👀👀👀👀
Credit to all Leeds players and their manager. They have had a great season and they have played some excellent football. From a man united supporter
Leeds reminding the PL that heart beats money , imagine how much better this team will be when our fans return to the stands.
I transferred Dallas for Dias in fantasy football 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The Cookstown Cafu
You just know Bamford subbed himself on fantasy league and thats why he didn't take the shot and laid off Dallas instead
It's like PES commentary
It was a good game (City fan)
Brilliant result. Anyone but Abu Dhabi City.
Oh my god Peter Drury. Unbelievably over the top commentary.
We don't care if they stunned city cuz city won the league
Leeds deserved the win today
Why does Peter Drury not commentate for every single game? No such thing as a boring game with Peter in the box.
If you’re are reading this comment God bless and I’m tryna hit 1k on YouTube so pls get me there
Wow!!!!👍👍👍👍
Could the death of Prince Philip mean that city lose every game now
Stones is an absolute fairy for not being able to either out-muscle or get a slide tackle in for that second goal. He will get absolutely destroyed in the euros.
Im a Wolves fan ,but Yay Leeds !
At this point, I’d happily listen to Peter Drury talk about the contents of his fridge and I’d still be gripped
Yes they beat man city well done
Well done, Leeds ..... Staying up easily ! Brilliant !
Man city over hyped team
About time. A minutes silence for a non marxist organisation. May his Royal highness rest in eternal peace.
"Invincibles" LOL
Peps face at the end when he sips his water like a feble child is priceless 🤣
Pep looks so sad😢
Man city got what they deserved nothing. Pepe thinks making multiple changes ever game makes no difference to he's team. pure arrogance.
3:23 is the best goal
When you hear Martin and the other commentator you JUST know this game will be delicious.
No way was that a red. What ever happened to a good tackle?
Bloody sterling blanking when I get him in and captain him in FPL
As a wise no eyes man once said how is tha a red
Hahahah F*** OFF CITY. F*** OFF CITY! yessssss
Leeds have one of the most promising goal keeper.
Petr Drury commentary is top class 🔥
Leeds Leeds Leeds Leeds Leeds
Never a red card. Well done Leeds!
Im so proud of us, what a season. Was expecting 3-1 to City, Dallas you beauty
Everyone loves a snatch and grab
Never a red
LORA RUNDY leeds
Took Dallas out my team this week
Ot sure how you can win the ball cleanly and still get sent off...games gone soft/mad.
Sterling was useless again, will be surprised if he is at City much longer.
And people say biesla's leeds can only play and win one way lol. Great performance
Hate it or love it, the underdogs on top
Varchester City
Dallas the Yorkshire Ronaldo 😎
Excellent news.
Unlike Leicester City, Leeds didn't play like cowards.
Wtaf
Arsenal can learn a lot from Leeds.
based on form imo gareth southgate shouuld drop sterling for sancho or rashford
Dury has the best commentary
MOT
Shocked!!! Even with 10 blokes. Excellent result lads. ALAW 💙💛💙💛
HOW IS THAT A RED??????
Eh seriously Couldn't believe it when I heard 10 man Leeds win at the etihad
Credit To bielsa
Sack Pep!
City having 1 goal from 29 shots compared to Leeds having 2 from 2 is actually a scoreline you'd see in Fifa Ultimate Team
goals against Man City 2021:  Dallas:2  Ronaldo/Messi: 0
So how is the Copper tackle a red card but the Pickford challenge on VVD didn't get any punishment.
Funny how these Dallas experts appear out of nowhere lmao
God I hate this commentator. Grating is an understatement
Martin Tyler take notes pal
Iam glad these clowns got beat. Well done Leeds. Dortmund should have drew on Wednesday, and I hope that City will get knocked out of the Champions League too.
hammering Leeds by 4 goals isn't for everybody
May as well stop playing defenders. Tackling is being taken out of the game. 20 yrs ago that would've been play on but footballers these days earn too much and can't take a bit of a rough challenge
It seems that Ruben Dias is the guy holding that team together. Just give him the captain armband already.
Peter Drury really is the GOAT commentator
What as a royal an former navy officer got do with football ? Same as the b.l.m take a knee crap wtf as politics got do with a game - nothing 😡   Great result for man city that is only letting in 2 shots in 2 imagine if leeds fancied ago 8 on target you say it couldn't happen could it villa hit liverpool for 7 stoke got 6 so yeah possable
Dallas is perhaps the most underrated midfielder in the Premier League. 7 goals this season and 4 of them against the top 3. Unreal!
Could have turned the crowd off for the silence at the start
Didn’t show Raphinha’s one on one
Love the way Leeds play,  front foot football but today was total grit and determination 👏
Peter Drury’s  commentary is........ASTONISHINGLY 😵😵😵😵😵. dramatic.
Stones has to put in a better challenge for the second goal
The Game has gone winning the ball and getting a red card. Referees & VAR are a disagree and should all be sack. They are trying Wenger’s Rule for Attackers to score more goals regarding Offsides can we do the same with defenders if you win the ball cleanly then surely they should be allowed to stay on the pitch. Before anyone says it’s serious foul play Baldock last week should have been sent off for Sheffield United but cause he has concussion it’s ok. The game has gone seriously referees and VAR need to look in the mirror.
Sad news about Lord Philip,taken far too early🇬🇧
that was not a red card. Leeds player won the ball, what happens after is a coming together. you cannot penalize the player who wins the ball cleanly. you should give a foul the other way for the city player who basically ran into the other guy after he lost the ball. red card needs to be for intentional foul or dangerous play. winning the ball cleanly first negates both of these reasons
leeds are the most unpredictable and impressive team to get promoted in a while😁
No one talking about how much Helder Costa stepped up this match
Time for everyone to start overhyping Leeds and start saying they will win the league
Dallas was fantastic today. Great team performance by Leeds
I really don't understand the red card. He's won the ball, he's got his foot that high because that's where the ball is, he has momentum because he's running, he can't do much about it. I don't get it.
This gives me a bad premonition about Chelsea later.
Leeds have done it again.👏
Quality Come On You WHITES 👏👏👏👏 GET IN THERE 🍻🍻👏👏👏🙌🙌
There a good team just inconsistent
Bielsa ball in full form
Commentators going on like england just won the world cup
If city loose 3 of their 6 matches and Man Utd win all of them somehow united will win the league
Peter Drury’s commentating is incredible! When he said "He wouldn't would he" it sent  Goosebumps tingling down my spine.
Highlights as usual are rubbish from Sky. Other chances for City and at least 2 other chances for Leeds with 10 men. Missed an excellent save with his feet from Ederson from Raphinha. Look at the highlights anywhere, but here.
Love the Leeds, hate man urinal 😂😂😂
Pep bullying royal family cause he made it to 100
Wasn’t a red card
Typical city..
Sterling’s T-rex arms....... wha-?
Imagine the limbs in the away end if the fans were there.
10 men and in Etihad stadium is very defective Man City rubbish
City just can’t defend .
Hahahahaha LOOOOOOL. from a Man U fan Bois😁😁😁😁😁😆🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
As a Leeds fan I'm delighted we defended Brilliantly
This MattHD’s Fut Champs Highlights?
As if it didn't show that Fernandinho challenge, Raphinha got sent flying 💀 absolutely beautiful display from Leeds though. MOT 💛💙💛💙
Pep always drinks water when his team concedes a goal joker
Of course when I bench a midtable 4.5m defender away against the league leaders he get 17 points
City are in the bin... pass it on
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 man city.....
Manchester is red 😋
That's so poor from Ederson on the second goal. He's given himself no time to react by being that far off his line. If he either starts deeper, or drops once Dallas gets the ball, it's an easy save.
Definition of a fut champs game 29 shots 1 goal 2 shots 2 goals and a goal in the last minute 😂
city had 29 shots and still lost 😳
fut champs moment
Never ever a red card that was corruption of the highest order cos leeds were 1-0 up. Refs have become an actual joke disgusting!
Who is watching villa and Liverpool?
Never a red card, he got the ball first. Baffles me that pundits say that "it doesn't matter if you get the ball first". Sick and tired of this absolutely bullshit follow through rule. You're asking footballers to defy the laws of physics and they can't do that. You can't stop yourself following through on a committed and equally good tackle
Imagine losing 2-1 at home to a Leeds side down a man for most of the second half.
Shocking pitch absolutely everyone was slipping
Rest In Peace Price Phillip You will be missed ❤️
Wow i predicted this score! There's always that odd score line you will get right.
Sky need to shell out all they can to get Peter Drury on commentary
This is not good for arsenal 😂🤣😂
Congratulations Leeds
marching on together
Sublime assist for Dallas' second.
Well done t'Leeds
This team got beaten by Crawley and now are winning against city 💀
POV: miniminter going mental
How was Sterling not sent off after stamping on the keeper?
Games gone soft never a red
Bielsa just big sammed guardiola
Leeds are brilliant to watch.. they play such energetic, exciting football, no fear today against City. Rode their luck at times but fair play to them!
Marching on together💪
Irishguy after seeing Leeds in top half: 😳
Man City - 21 shots, 1 goal Leeds - 2 shots, 2 goals  Real life Fifa
If Dallas was English and not Northern Irish, he would be talked about by much of the English press and then some. What a season he's having individually. Quality.
The fans in that away end would have been heard for miles away
Had Stirling squared for Jesus, City would be long gone and collected 3 points but he was selfish and shot instead. Not good Team play. The rest is history. Come on UNITED lol
City bought the ref but still couldn’t win lmao
Well played Leeds 10 men Vs 12 and still won
God I wish the fans were able to see this in a stadium!
10 men !!! Let that sink
We win the league by proxy then right? MOT
Stirling 8000 touches - loses the ball 7999 times  ... I mean surely someone needs to mention it.
They must of not had enough oil money to buy the ref
This is why i say refs cheat for city this the second time in a week.
When Super Leeds beat the table toppers at home with 10 men 😀👊
City need to get Big Sam in! A manager who knows what he’s doing and a born winner!
Calling it the ultimate steal doesnt mean much when you dont show us what minute of the match it is
City had 29 shots and Leeds had 2 shots while playing the second half in their own box with 10 men and still won 2-1. That says it all.
we beat them 6-2 city lose 2-1 lol 😂
Plastic fc
Stones having another shocker of a game 😂
That City goal looked offside.
All of City was being tested for champions league, if the whole starting team was actually playing it would’ve been a different result 😂
29 shots 1 goal 2 shots 2 goals  This is some FIFA scripting
You know you support a good team when the title of a 2-1 loss is worded as if San Marino has just beat france in the worldcup final
If that's a red card there would be 10 a match. Shocking  decision.
Did the player that caught the keeper get a booking?!?
I had Dallas on my FL bench 🤦‍♂️
From a man united fan and i hate to say it but, get the bloody hell in there leeds united!!!!!!!!  P.s peter drurys commentary is amazing fam.
💛💙💛💙💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
YOU cant always win.. LOVE IT!
Could you imagine the scenes of Leeds fans were allowed in the ground. Packed out away end. Limbs🤯🤯
Peter Drury's commentary is an advert to retire Martin Tyler's boring commentary... Passion Martin! Remember that?
leeds play some great football 💪 smash n grab
We’re the best team in the world
(No offence) but of all teams Leeds, bruh what is this year?! This season has been full of suprises.
I benched him in fantasy :/
never a red card
Football is a joke. Not even a Leeds fan but that red card is a joke. They need to start putting dresses over the bubblewrap on players
You definitely gave us a nail-biting game City truly a pleasure playing football with you gents good game guys 💙💙🤜🤛💛💙
2:26 realise commentary just going “he absolutely SPANKED it” 😂😂😂
As a Liverpool fan, I'm 1) delighted for Leeds, who should have enough points now to be completely safe  2) sure City will see this as just one of those blips in what has been another impressive season.  Can't argue with a team that wins 21 on the roll.
Why does this commentator shout as soon as anyone gets near the goal?
That red card, Jesus.  Here’s your usual comment about your Ince’s and Keanes playing today.
Stones the most improved centre back this season they said lmao
City to bottle prem and win fa cup and champions league 😉 heard it here first
Get in dirty Leeds
O-3 at Crawley seems a long time ago now...We're top of the bounce-backability league once again! LUFC since '73. MOT, ALAW.
Mighty Leeds United
Is Bamford shouting “encore“🤣
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Great to see Leeds still going for the win even when they had their backs to the wall.
Title race back ON 😏
The stats weren’t the best but Leeds played extremely well with 10 men, what an amazing 2 goals from Dallas
Leeds showing city who the bigger club is 👊🏻
21 IS COMING
What. A. Through ball 😍
LEEDS   LEEDS   LEEDS
The commentary tho is underrated 🔥  something you rarely see in the PL
What a card inform Dallas will be
meslier save where sterling went and stamped right on his hand and got NOTHING... You didn't show raphinha getting through on goal after Dallas's goal and getting taken out... The second one should of definitely been a red not a yellow... YET cooper was sent off when he got the ball... VAR is trash especially when you rewind to baldocks challenge on Roberts last week and he got nothing
He wouldn't...would he?
Leeds are the most exciting team to watch this year
Ridiculous red btw
Calm down commentator 🤣
10 man you know
Man City goal offside. Definitely by today's standards. No VAR check. Mystery..... 😳
What a win, nice one Leeds
What a team Leeds United truly are MOT. Who are we???.......LEEDS
The second goal, Ederson shouldn’t come out that early or shouldn’t even come out, poor positioning from him. If he didn’t leave his line this game will be 1:1
Dallas has had an unbelievable season. 7 goals, 2 assists and 9 clean sheets! Well done to him
How to beat Man City at home: wear Burgundy kits ✅
-Cooper was given a red card for a solid tackle from the side, clearly getting the ball, straight red. -Ref lets first half play out until 3 minutes past the initial injury time, while leeds have 10 men. -Fernandinho gets fouls from behind, not touching or aiming to touch the ball, yellow card. -Ref lets second half play out another 3 minutes past the initial injury time, while leeds have 10 men.  That oil money has been paying these referee's and assistants nicely.
How tf are we gonna win bvb by playing like this
I watched it for 5mins then city scored and turned it off as they were all over them
There will not be a win like this again this season... ridiculous statement
congratulations Leeds Utd your kept going,  and it goes and  proves that  persuasion means nothing if you don't do something with it
Go LUFC 🍾👌🏻🙌🏼
Ake is a shambles
How is that a red card????? He won the ball. Game is being ruined by fairies.
Peter drury should be commentator in the next fifa
how can anyone defend that red card? surely thats a legbreaking tackle and definite red?
Leeds love spoiling a Lancashire hot pot😂
Edersons positioning sometimes can be atrocious. The goal he conceded at the very end was terrible
Sterling is a clown
So getting sent off because of the follow through even though got the ball clean first🤔
Leeds!
You gotta love the Premiership
2:25 He did what?? 😳
that commentary for the last goal was fantastic
Wow disgraceful lack of action from Stones for the winner
🤣🤣🤣🍻👊🏾
Whats criminal is sterling still been on the pitch and cooper been sent off. Sterling cost man City in bad karma
was the city goal offside? i have seen harder decisions against leeds. ah but wait a moment its a scum club we are playing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Peter Drury's commentating makes the game 100% better. Much better than Mcmanaman and Darren fletcher
Imo stones should of took one for the team
LEEDS LEEDS LEEDS!!!!!! 🍾🍾🍾
I love how they put Phillip dying in the highlights. Certainly the highlight of my week haha
Fair play to Leeds a true smash and grab. But city do really need a striker chance after chance.
That's what happens to City when Dias is not playing
I remember Wales doing this away against a very good Danish side in the 90s. They won 2-1 having achieved NO attempts on target.  One deflection and one OG.
I've got goosebumps watching that MOT
well played dallas, love the resilience from leeds to get that late equaliser, this game was a great watch
Get the fans back in ffs!!
They could have put the entire second half in the highlights
Games like these is why we need fans back ASAP!
People who say that ain’t a red are just trying to be different
💛💙💛💙
Manchester United 6-2 Leeds
Ahhh I love the premier league
City fan here but fairplay to leeds they were clinical and took their chances unlike us their defence was on point today gg
Am I the only one who thinks that was never a red card?
United have 2 games in hand. If they win both they’ll be 8 points behind City. Please, god. Please!
That was never a red card
"There will not be a win like this again this year, or for many years"  Alright relax mate, a 10-man team scored late to win 2-1 after sitting everyone in their own box for the 2nd half, its not that outrageous 😂
Funny, 1 min into the game, I said cooper and llorente are going to cost leeds the game...they sure enough tried lol, dallas to the rescue get in!
Salute Leeds players and staff!!! 👏👏👏🗣💯
Big W
Peter dury is the best commentator going right now
Rip to me and all those who took Dallas out of our FPL teams
meslier is what chelsea thought they were getting with kepa
Who saw this happening llolololololol
Coys
Peter Drury should do the commentary for the England games in the summer - spine tingling voice!!!
still Leeds > man City
Glory glory Leeds United.
Stones dogshit
Dallas has scored more goals in one match against Man City than Werner has this year
Let's hope they lose to Dortmund in the CL too.
Man City haven't beat Leeds since 2003😁
You literally could put the ending commentary in the match where city won the premier league with Aguero's goal and it won't sound out of place😂😂😂😂
Hon the Leeds 🤍
Justice done, perfectly good ball winning challenge by Cooper. Great victory.
Well done lads!!! Can av a beer and relax for rest ov weekend. MOT!
Congratulations Leeds! Can’t wait to see what you can do next season
mancity had 28 attempts but scored 1. how?
What a ball and finish to top it! 😍
Leeds didn’t deserve a red card. Although against 10 players, these rented players by oil money can’t win 😂 again, Oil money don’t always work, dear Varchester Shity.
No matter how hard he tried, the referee couldn’t beat 10 man leeds.
Arsenal are now 11th. Banter club…
WE ARE LEEDS!!!
If we're going to lose a match, let it be this one. We rested big players and it'll be worth it if we get past Dortmund.
Now if United win their 2 games in hand they'll only be....8 points behind 😂
The beauty of Dallas's megs for his second
Me having Dallas on bench in fpl.
Gg tbf Leeds 👏
And from this day forward Leeds fans to everyone “YEH BUT HAVE YOU BEATEN CITY AWAY WITH 10 TEN THOUGH”
29 shots 1 goal, 2 shots and 2 goals, down to 10 men at half time with a 91st minute winner, and yet EA still says there's no scripting in the game
999th liker
RIP dmx
Hope city start dropping more points but I doubt it. This is a one off
Winning at the Etihad is already impressive, but doing it with 10 men against City's 12 is incredible.
Cooper shouldn't of been sent off... But after Dallas scored the second raphinha got through on goal but got taken out and he only got a yellow... Should of been red cuz he was last man and it was a goal scoring opportunity
1000 likes and I will getStuart Dallas' name tattooed on myself
united's title charge is back on
Meslier is crominally underrated
I hope City won't lose against Dortmund
This city team wont win the quadruple. I put the centurions 17/18 over this lot easily
Unfortunately follow through, games dead if that’s a red!
Sky commentators always backing the so called "big team" when Leeds get the winner he seems amazed, patronising twit. Not a Leeds or City fan, just want decent even handed commentaries.
Despite being a good team  Every season city always have to fall to a shock defeat  Last season it was Norwich  This season it’s Leeds
26 shots to 2 that is the biggest shithousery I've ever seen
Cancelo is overrated. Only gets hype coz he doesnt acc play his position
I think, Bielsa to Pep is like a Boss level in a game that is impossible to beat lol
ALAW Dallas has to be one of the most underatted players in the league
Shocking
City paying for the highlights not to come out 😂🤣🤣
Fair play
Could say leeds had     Dallas laugh   Muahahaha
Fair play to Leeds they were the better team today I would say
This mans commentating just makes the moment way more special
Like a game of FUT champs
We’ve said on this podcast that Sterling needs to work on his finishing, and after today’s performance he probs wouldn’t be able to finish this video
ALAW MOT ⚪️🟡🔵
Hahaha hahaha 😆
2:15 sterling got NOTHING for being late, not getting the ball and stamping on mesliers hand
Leeds won.oh God now which pl team am I gonna take the mick out of for losing 3_0 to league 2 chorley 😢
A game comes along every once in a while where it ends up being 29-2 shots but the team with 2 shots wins. City deserved to win but well done to leeds they're some team to watch!
Whoever left Dallas out of their FPL sleep with socks on
im gonna buy agueiro i made my desision
DALLAS GOATED
Dallas one of r own 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
The last minute steal is a beauty
bamford to play back up to kane at the euros
Shout out to the PES commentators
Can we just appreciate the commentary😍
Anyone thinking who Leeds are buying next because they are hopefully staying up this season they get another £100m to spend wonder who’s gonna be bought 🤷‍♂️
Ref was awful that game... Clearly had biases towards city
That was never a red card
And thats why we all love leeds! Especialy more so today ❤
I thought man City would do a west brom and beat them 5-2  Oh how I was wrong
Typical Man City, 29 attempts, 1 goal. Leeds 2 attemps 2 goals.Watching Sterling play today made me sick. This guy is nowhere near top level and he gets all his goals and assists only because he has a decent team around him .Man city can never win champions league with Sterling and Jesus. They need a decent finisher . Even Gundogan is a better finisher than Sterling and Jesus.
Dallas u Beaty
Gimme that Raphinia upgrade
What a team. What a game 😍💛💙  Who agrees 😍 👇🏾
Here before the arsenal fans
That pole corner kick for Leeds was incredible!
you CAN'T win against the best team in the country away from home with ten men..... LEEDS "Hold my nutrition drink..."
At this point, its just frustrating.
Upsetting defeat we were dominant but just couldn't finish our chances and fair play by Leeds
Jota or torres
VARchester City, that's not a red, justice was served in the end
That's what happens when you play ake instead of dias 🤦🏾‍♂️
QUADRUPLE IS ONNNNN
One of those games ,kinda bayern vs psg
I’m livid but FairPlay Leeds
Pretty sure Dallas was playing as a striker at the end of that match...is there any position this man can't play in!???
But but Leeds cant beat the big teams. Naive burnout Bielsa 🤣🤣🤫🤫
If fans were allowed in the stadium then the Leeds fans would’ve give the etihad an atmosphere for sure😂
Get innnnnn
Took your time
9 clean sheets and a top notch defensive performance away to the best team in the league. Not bad for a team that can't defend 🤔
How tf is that a red he gets the ball first
City 29 Shots - 1 goal Leeds 2 shots - 2 goals A real smash and grab!
HOLD UP HOLD UP HOLD UP  Am I dreaming?
This is the defenition of smash and grab.
Imagine United get revenge for the Aguero moment in the last game of the season and snatch the title... Martin Tyler: BruuuuunNNNNOOOOOO
Well deserved. Referee a disgrace.
Dirty Leeds Scum
Even if Man City do the quadruple, they couldn't beat the mighty Leeds this season.
Dallas > penandes
Coming from a City fan, congratulations to Leeds United.
Title charge back on 🤡💀
2 Goals, 2 shot whole game, this proves it is not all about shots or possession, just take the opportunity
Never a red card
Leeds doing every other club a favour by beating Man City.
That puts us in eleventh
Disgrace that leeds got a red card.... VARCHESTER city at its finset....
The Fantasy Football King
Let’s go big Leeds supporter very happy with this result Dallas is class
That red card is an utter joke gawd the game has gone soft. He won the ball end of
Let’s be honest city are still going to win the prem easily
We’ve been waiting for thus
29 shots to 2. And leeds win 2-1. So unlucky...
Beating Leeds isn’t for everyone  Man a 6-2 Leeds  Man City 1-2 Leeds
Crazy game
Amazing what can happen when you actually attack lol
Im sure north korea would make everyone do a silence too if kim dies..... But we are a free country
2:58 Connection has been lost with your opponent.
Never a red varchester city
Let’s gooooo Leeds 🙌🙌🙌
The fact that Leeds United won against Manchester City with 10 men .

What a team who said we cant defend 💛💙
Leeds are the most exciting and unpredictable team to watch. Credit to them👏
I just took Dallas out of my fpl 😭😭😭
Been watching the Swansea highlights for twenty minutes now, finally
Man City absolutely dominated with 29 shots but 1 goal and Leeds had 2 shots with 2 goals
hopefully united at least attempt to close the gap and make the title race a tiny bit more interesting
Dallas Cookstown Cafu 💯
Always a great sight to see city drop a couple points to a newly promoted side😍
What a leeds team this is with a few more additions , a scary scary thought
Man City outdoing Arsenal as the banter club of the week lol
I know it's easy to say this now but Staurt Dallas is a criminally underrated player, has been pitting in amazing performances week in week out for Leeds, he scores a lot of goals for a left back
This was a real life fifa match
The referee wanted city to win 🤣

Hahah I can't stop laughing 😆
Love them or hate them, Leeds are always an exciting watch.
What a game for leeds both teams played well 👏
Dallas the fpl legend of the season love that man
Rip Prince Philip
Come on Leeds. MOT 💛💙💛💙💛💙
Fair play to leeds, this match had me on the edge of my seat.
Sterling should consider himself lucky as he probably get's feeded the most chances as a winger yet he struggles so score all these chances
Finally sky sports uploaded it 🤩
if this isnt evidence that city needs to sign a striker idk what is also sell mendy the guys a donkey
Bielsa is the best manager in the world and imagine the scenes in the away end
1st
Unlucky City
Stop stop! You can stop refreshing now!
