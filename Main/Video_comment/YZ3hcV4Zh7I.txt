Hilarious
Am I the only one that noticed SAD-ist's youtooz has a Hamilton logo by the side of the grass block?
IM IN THW MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM! Going into my Quote Note😂
girl you have no idea how long i was obsesed with your animations
even in the bloopers real there's still that awesome moment when ghostbur says he wants tommy to bring him back to life and there's just a crack of thunder
2:46 i love the little easter egg of techno saying “so long theseus”
“I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MOM!!” I’m crying 😭
1:00 Tommy only having one shoe made me chuckle
Aww, dang: it didn't include when Tommy accidently unalived himself (I think he jumped too high for his low health, or something?) running from Dream who'd been threatening to kill and revive him, over and over 😂😂🤣 "TommyInnit died trying to escape Dream." That was such a "...wtf?" moment from everyone who then popped up to see what had happened 😆😆🤣
1:14 my favorite part ever in this video
Man I missed the times before half of them got cancelled
Lol Wilbur
2:01 bro is throwing the war is over tommy threw
2:17 please do not animate that ( you animating it)😂😂😂

"Of course my discord breaks at this moment, one sec- *freakin' LOGS OFF*  *ranboo laughing* "No- I was doing so well- NOOO-"   love this- i love the choice of clips!! ❤❤❤
Bommer zoomer doesn't exist. But that's most funniest thing ever!!!!

I miss the dream smp and i miss techno too
I loved the little dancing SAD-ist's at the end! They're so cute!
Can I use this for a video
back in 2025 God i miss it
I'm glad that even though everything went to shit, I can still enjoy and reminisce these animations :)
I miss these days
Even 4 years later after everything this is still funny
Watching this again and pretending everything is fine
I Watch vids from the dream SMP from 4-3 years ago and pretend half of them aren’t predators psychopaths or abuser AND THET RANBOO AND TUBBO ARE STILL FRIENDS I MISS THEM SO MUCH 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m just gonna watch this and pretend that almost every person in this video is not problematic <\3
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you add this one in CO………….😂
I love how Tommy screams "MY STENE" because he was trying to say "my stuff!" and "my scene!" at the same time😂😂
Rewatching this after Dream’s crashed out 😭
May 21 IS MY BRITHDAYYY
And look at them now. 1:20
the little ghost and the cutaways are everything
HIIIII :D

I DID NOT EXPECT THE DSMP MEMBERS TO COMMENT LOL
2:02 “IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM!”
i love this
ngl the best blooper video i ever have seen
this was over 3 years ago?? this is so nostalgic 😭
I miss this so bad..
i love how most of these are just tommy laughing at the top of his lungs

Moore Brian Williams Jeffrey Martin Edward
Re-watching this Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee
My biggest flex ngl is not only getting a photo with bbh but also my comment getting liked by motherinnit on Twitter in 2024
Wilbur: "Tommy, I want you to bring me back to life" Tommy: "what?.." Wilbur: "bring-" Tommy: *proceeds to get struck by lighting*  ... I don't know what to say-
Sad_ist should get 3M!!
the way that I’m still giggling abt this to this day bro lmfao
“CVM!” -Wilbur Soot 2020 (maybe 2021)
2024,and i keep watching this😍
this aged horribly
I can’t believe I have nostalgia for the dream SMP
"So long Theseus" . . . Right now its not olded well.  Blood for the Bloody God. Greatness for a Blade, whos never dies.
The figure realised on my birthday
A lot of times when a show an anime or something else is really sad/depressing actor AUs get made so it's nice that there are bloopers like this to remind you that they are in fact just acting
AND SHE IS NOT THROWING AWAY HERE, SHOT, SHE IS NOT THROWING AWAY HERE SHOT! SHE’S JUST LIKE HER CREATIONS, SHE’S HAS IS HER OWN FIXATIONS, AND SHE’S NOT THROW’N AWAY HER, SHOT, SHE’S GONNA TAKE A SHOT! get it cause of the Hamilton symbol
Everything was so much simpler back then....
It seems like Tommy causes most dream SMP bloopers just because of his AURA
COME BACK
I love this!!!
best thing I've ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:46 so long theseus
booooooooo *throws rotten tamato*
1:50
I MISS THE DSMP SMMMMMM
Hello! 2024 ;(
0:26
is… is that Hamilton?
THATS A CANNON LIFE DREAM IT PROGRESSED THE LORE!!!!!!+!
The so long Theseus when Tommy got struck by lightning had me laughing so hard. Rest in peace Techno.
Tommy: Please do not animate this SAD-ist: oops
"I WAS DOING SO WELL! NOO-"
Where do I find the actual episodes
These animations are something I love to look back on. Amazing works of art.
"Of course my discord breaks during this, one second." "PFFFFFT *laughter* NOOOO- I WAS DOING SO WELL-"  -Dream and Ranboo
MUM IM LIIIVE
Wait did you like work with them for this or did you find these on stream of them talking????????
I KEEP LAUGHING AT THIS BRO😂
funny watching her saying that the youtooz will drop on may 21st and im watching this 3 years later on may 21st
1:29  bro dying 💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The era that i will never forget and will forever ingrained in my heart
This is literally like 3 minutes of Tommy screaming his lungs out
I like how all of the hyperfixatations are in the background of the youtooz
Lol that's funny Dream just died when he exploded the chest
2:31
no way 0:06
“I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER MUM!” I’M DYING 😭
Anyone here at 2024
Hello........
This is hilarious great job
Tommyinnit ranboo ❤ ❤️‍🔥
АМЕРИКАНЦЫ, ПОСМОТРИТЕ ОЗВУЧКУ ДИМУ МАКИЯЖНИКОВА !
АМЕРИКАНЦЫ, ПОСМОТРИТЕ ОЗВУЧКУ ДИМУ МАКИЯЖНИКОВА !
she actually listened to them
Dream: wheeze Tommy: AGGRESSIVE COUGHING
Dream, after blowing himself up: "THATWASNTINTHESCRIPTTHATWASNTINTHESCRIPT-" Tommy, who saw the whole thing: *dying of laughter* Sad-ist, the camera person: "I don't get paid enough for this-"
Cringing from the future (cuz of wil, dream and George)
WE NEED MORE OF THESE
youtooz came on my birthday🎉 (its not today, i just rewatched this and it came may 21st)
"I WAS DOING SO WELL-" -Ranboo
I wonder which of those is the most replayed? My bet is between Dream blowing himself up and “I’M IN A WAR MUM!”
Haha you sound exactly like Lady Rainicorn from adventure time :D
My thi-😂😂😂
we miss u SAD-ist.
The discord break for dream in the ranboo blooper is so funny lmfao (also this is amazing)
I actually got to talk to Tommy's mother 😭
I’m fully convinced Technoblade smited Tommy 😂
“IM IN A WAR MUM, NO I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER” Bro this stuff is GOLD 😂
still giving youtooz?
you guys think im early for the youtooz
ITS SO LAYE AND ITS HARD TO HOLD MY LAUGHER💀
LOL 😂💀
hey what kind of app/think do you use to animate ?
i see hamilton on youtooz.
YOUR A GIRL!?!?!?
My dumb azz remembering that you’re part of the dream SMP😂
Bro I wish the ending would've been Tommy saying "Death is meant to be permanent" it would show how much his character would've grown
Omg I know this was uploaded forever ago but sadist’s voice is so pretty what???
the fact Tommy is in most of these is hilarious
I forgot how much I loved the Ranboo Lore
i thought the figures pen was a nuke
I love how SAD-ist is slowly becoming canon to the dsmp
It also makes it very convenient that Wilbur was talking to sad-it’s in the actual clip and she just had the clip which makes the camera person whine more realistic
Y know its a good video when TommyInnit comments
LOVE THR ANIMATION KEEP UP THR GRETA WORK LOVE THE EFFORT IB THIS VIDEO 👑👑🔥💪🫡🙏🙏🙏🫡🫡💪💪🔥👑
im watching this in 2023.. apparently your yootooz realeased on my bday

Tommy’s hysterical laugh is so iconic.
dude when tommy laughs it feels like its painful xD
This is awesome
even being censored at 0:36, i can still tell what wilber wanted to say
When I feel sad about the lore, I just like to imagine this is all just like a big netflix show and they're all friends and shit and no one died
“CO-“ Wilbur 2021
Hey sad-ist I don’t know if you will see this but I think you Are a fucking amazing animator And I wish I could do things like you!❤❤
Did anyone else get a notification for this two years later?
I know this seem weird but the mouth on Rambo seem cool cause it like he have no mouth or something but it there and like slime idk what it call but at this 2:57
Id be the one to shout "gangam style!" In the middle of a scene even as a theatre kid
Sad-ist is an amazing animetor
“You have to start asking yourself the bigger questions in life. How did SAD-ist get so good at drawing hands?”
The dancing SAD-ists make me happy 😂
Well this became nostalgic
I just love how Tommyinit is in like every blooper!😂😂

2:30 That lightning feels personal to this day
Pure gold
SAD-IST FOR DREAM SMP

Sad-ist is that grandparent with all the stories to tell being like: “ah yes I remember when a war over music happened when I was young…”
Can you just imagine Asking your kid to come empty the dishwasher And then hearing "I'M IN A WAR MOM!!!"
"MOM I CAN'T DO THE DISHES, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR"
SAD-ist you should and merely recommend PLS ANIMATE THE QSMP 😅It be soooo cool with the way your animations are ❤

THE FACT THE DSMP YOU TUBERS ARE ALL COMMENTING LOL
Gotta love how Wilbur points you out
THE GOSPEL (updated)   Hello guys! May I have your attention even for just a second? this might take awhile btw haha-(this will get long)  I would like to share something to all of you, feel free to read what I have to say,  whether you may read this or not it is your free will if you will stay, but if you wish to leave then go ahead and do so,  I am in NO way, shape or form trying to force this unto anyone, just scroll down if you dislike or feel offended of this.   However, if you do, it IS and can be a missed opportunity to know more about this topic of truth. I am not forcing you to stay, for I am quite aware that many of you may have had a very bad experience with people sharing their belief or ideology in the past.  On behalf of those people, whoever they may be, I truly apologize, I'm just trying to create a safe space for every person, mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally.  But even so, try to listen, even for just a bit :)  The Gospel is free to absolutely everyone, no matter what religion, race or background etc. you may have been in.  Everyone is welcome to accept this free gift :D  Anyways, let's start!  -------  Sin was passed upon all men by one man  Adam, and death is a consequence of this sin  (Rom 5:12).   Mankind has an eternal destiny of  condemnation and wrath – Hell – because of  this sin (Rom 6:23).   No matter what good  works one might do we are still found sinners in the sight of our Creator God.   And all un righteous and those who follow get His wrath.  BECAUSE We cannot be found  Righteous for by God’s law we are found sinners (Rom 3:19-20).  If we have broken even one law we are found guilty.  Just a simple curse, a roll of an eye, a lustful look or even just by being ourselves, is already subjected to Hell fire, because no matter what we do this isn't at all worthy of anything, even our own good are compared to filthy rags.  (Isaiah 64:6)  That is also why the LAW is there to STOP our mouths for us to REALIZE we can NEVER do it. (Romans 3:19)  Now because of this reason of not being able to  create our own righteousness and being born  in a sinful flesh that we need a SAVIOR (Titus 3:5).   Now on to the GOSPEL.   That savior is Jesus Christ.  Salvation was finished and DONE by HIM and every ounce of our salvation RESTS ONLY BY HIS SACRIFICE. Once we trust He saved us, gave us eternal life, reconciled us by HIS blood, we are SEALED by the Holy spirit of promise, till the day of redemption. (Ephesians 4:30)  THEN HE LEADS us to our purposes of righteous practical living, based on OUR NEW identity in Christ , as REASONABLE service and NOT to "work our way to salvation"(because remember, there is NON good but GOD(Mark 10:18) but to simply act as God's children, because HE LOVED US SO MUCH that Jesus died for us.  That's the service we can give because of such an impact JESUS did WILLINGLY, it is our gratitude and not an act of trying to earn what we can NEVER achieve.   It is a FREE GIFT(Romans 6:23) afterall, you can't earn a gift, because that wouldn't be a gift anymore, but a reward, and remember, Jesus dying is not worthy of any of us, we do not DESERVE such a great sacrifice, that is why you also can't earn salvation on your own, because we just CAN NEVER do it.   And Jesus died EXACTLY for ALL of that, because He loves us too much.   This simple Gospel message is also in:  1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version(for a more simple summary)  "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures"  NOTHING added to it because it's JUST THAT SIMPLE! :D  There's more about the Gospel out there that I highly suggest, like Renee Roland for further assurance and Mark Dejesus for the psychological aspects of being a Christian.  Anyways that's it! if you made it till the end, than I am HIGHLY grateful for giving me this chance to share to you!  God bless and TAKE CARE! <3   (idk I'm just so passionate about this because so little so few people know the simple message of the Gospel of Christ, or even take it seriously at that T^T thanks so much for reading tho! Means a lot to me.)
sad ist was on top of the world now she is failing to gain videos
I remember watching this when it came out
"C***"
"im in a war, mum!"
For the voices are they the official ppl or do you use va that can do their voices
Bye Dream smp i will miss you.
Idc if she dosent to content abt qsmp or any other smp, SHES THE CAMERSMAN IN THEM ALL
The good times 😞
The fact they are aware that sadist makes these videos is just better        And that most are just Tommy being silly with Wilbur, Technoblade or Dream😂
Please watch 😂😂😂😂 1:14
I love how Dream just kinda f l o p p e d back into his stuff
Am I late
Oppa geggnum stile
I love how the universal concept is that Sad-ist is the official cameraman for DSMP 😂
Imagine having to explain to your mom that you can't clean the dishwasher, because you're in a war against a green smiley face, and that you have to go steal your most prized possession.          .                            ✨ *Music discs*  ✨
tommy is really the person who died when dream blew up
crap this is sooo good
I want to be Sadist when I grow up
I love dream smp stuff

Ate Sadist penge po bente
When Tommy got hit by the lighting, my little sister said, "he got toasted."
I absolutely love this, I’m laughing so hard rn 🤣
If anyone is wondering, the music in the intro is called “Dating Start!” By Toby Fox
can we all agree that the best part of this video is the end
“I WAS DOING SO WELL! NOOOOOOOO!-“
Tommyinnint called you cool from his video
Now sadist put this in, *C-*
3:00 ok this moment has been on my brain for so long. Was the missing hand behind the leg intentional, or did you not see it in the final cut? Overall great video and animation, it was a splendid thing to watch all the time❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️
2:28 bro really said “my name is barry allen and I am the fastest man alive”
i give you so much support and your really good at drawing and i love your videos and art
Goblin

Sad-ist is the cameraman for a film series called dream smp that aired for 3 season.

This wasn’t bloopers, it was just tommy laughing so hard he couldn’t breathe.
"I WAS DOING SO WELL NOOOO"  mood
“I want you to revive me..”  *both start dying*  Such beauty

"Thus why this video is here" (0:49)
Tommy: *In a war* His mom:  “EMPTY THE DISHWASHER!”  Tommy: “ *IM IN A WAR MOM!* ”
I gotta say they scripted the war so well and SAD-ist’s animations make it even better it feels like I’m watching an actual movie and ik it was years ago but it feels like yesterday and R.I.P. Techno 💕 🕊
this is the funniest thing ever
I love that she's just depicted as a camera worker
DO MORE FUNNY.
For awhile I thought she said Topping Sadist
Yooo how does one make amazing movie-level animation that is incredibly fun to watch... IN A BLOOPER'S REEL??? This is actually incredible, thank you Sadist and our amazing, absolutely unscuffed and brilliant streamers XD
is that hamotion
Poor Ranboo, he was doing so well with the lore. 😢
Siuuuuuuu
1:51 oh no, he disconnected from the matrix
the last one with ranboo and dream always makes me laugh so hard
I love how at 0:50 dream just blows himself up instead XD
U have a nice voice miss, keep it up
NO I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER IM LIVE
The beginning tho 😂😂😂😂
Something i find funny is that Tommy is in most of these 😂😂
This made me smile :)
I love how Ranboo got mad at that. “I was doing so well! Nooo!” Just made me laugh so much for some reason lol
He laughs so hard I honestly worry about his throat.
YOU ACTUALLY MADE THIS WITH THEM????
私は貴方のアートがとても好きです‼︎‼︎ 見た瞬間貴方のファンになりました‼︎‼︎ これはきっと運命です☺️💕
Ranboo: CANNON CANNON CANNON CANNON CANNON CANNON
The things you had to deal with in animating this for the SMP members is gold-
Ghostbur: *having a moment* God: *smites Tommy for the hell of it*
Michael with a h20 sprayer: points at ranboo Ranboo: runs to panic room
Wilbur- ayo sad-ist put this one in CUUUU-
If it was still going they should have invited SAD-sit to the SMP
2:59 “Oh so you’ve come 😨- come here to my panic room 😖”
2:36 so that’s how tommy died when techno, philza and dream were destroying manberg
I love how they are active all dramatically and then it’s just all “BAHHHAAAHAHAHAHAHSGD”
why does tommy fukin start choking when he is laughing 😭
OK WE NEED SADIST IN THE DSMP S2
Were that the real Dream SMP characters who sincronized themself?

Is 1:16 and 3:05 gonna be a vid ? Or-
Wow nice edit cool but it's funny
Dream: * blows himself up and screams ‘f*ck that hurt’ in enchantment table *  Tommy: * wheezes his life away *
NOO I DIDNT GET IT 😭
Accurate representation of all rp groups
My favourite bit is the lightning blooper and dream frantically saying "that wasn't in the script that wasn't in the script"
Legal
Talking sadist has a very nice voice
Wilbur: I want you to bring me back to life tommy Tommy: Wha- DreamXD: *I SHALL STRIKE TOMMY WITH LIGHTNING*
Tommy: “do not animate that.” SAD-ist: sorry buddy, the animation animated by itself.
When dream explode, tommy start to lose it🤣
2:45 He knew... He knew...
these animations are crazy insane great work keep it up
*I feel like sad-ist was hired to do this*
1:12 😭😭😭
I bought the dsmp members yootooz. I love yours and Nikis. My official children
I have the youtooz <3
I still love how basically all of these are Tommy
Ranboo rlly tried lol
Tommy

I love how when Tommy laughs you can barely hear anything else

*Me who just Woken up at 10:00 am
Hi
Nice but funny sad-ist
the "so long theseus" was a nice touch
Omg i cant stop watching this
boopersssssssss
you sound like itzy ryujin a lot
MAN.... MAN...... L'Manberg memories, the accountant office, ohhhhh man.
I just watched ranboo break a car down and shit bricks today and seeing him acting is something I haven’t seen in a while (old boober moment 💪😼)
Hey, i have some questions. Would be rlly cool if you could answer :D  1. Sooo which app do you use? I am starting to make animations on Flipa Clip but…idk i am just asking bc i wanna explore :D 2. Also are you like a professional? I mean do you do this for a living? Amd 3. Your animations ARE INSANE I MEAN IT since how long do you do this ? Like dang, i cant describe how good they are hnonestly (Dang this a whole danm interview lmao) 4. Oh one more did you animate in the app also the colour effects and with wich app did you cut the whole thing and the music? Note: would be really cool if you could answer all the questions haha😅 i am a young artist and still need many tips😅
I was scared to whatch it because I can't laugh
Hi sad-ist  I have 1 request for you I want you too make a like a 1 hour video about dream smp cos your video are like a trailer for a movie  ik this request would be hard as it normally takes 3 months for like a 3-5 min video and it will probably take like a year to make a 1 hour video (you don't have to do this request cos ik it hard to do but if u can I would love to see it and Ik the people will be would love it to )
THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR F**KIN KIDS
hey Sad-ists is this what they actually do in the dream smp?
SAD that wasent in the script is wasent CUT
dream: being scary also dream: *blows himself up* tommy's laugh when he does made me laugh almost as hard
wE nEeD mOrE bLoOpERs
This was so funny
Wilbur’s face is priceless at 0:37, and Tommy just looks possessed at one frame 😂😂😂

Little sadist dancing at the end is pure gold
1:31 1:44
Absolutely amazing
This is fantastic
I love how even though Ranboo is sitting you can still tell by the dimension of his legs how tall he is
2:46 ☹️☹️
Tommy died
2:46 did SAD-ist just predict the future?
Tommy: Please do NOT animate that!!  SAD-ist: Y'all hear sum?
HAHA
❣️💔💔💔❣️
😅😅

i like how sad ist guess the last techno video with one flash 2:46
Wait SAD-ist is a girl? How did I not know this whole time
What was the intro music?
Fun fact: Dream was the one who made lightning strike Tommy.
So the amp is scripted?
When sad-ist blogged and like I thought that’s Drista
the fact that its saying so long theseus and now its 2022 and you remember technoblades last video '' so long neds'' rip techno
2:46 The fact that technoblade is saying "So long theseus"... Kind of reminds me of a recent video.
Sad-ist your youtooz are already sold and lm broke 😕
Can You Fo more Of these?
can you make a video about ghostbur
ofc 4/5 of them Tommy is in🤣
This is when you just join the fun XD
Okay but can we take a moment to appreciate ranboo’s acting-
c!dream: sinister, evil, manipulative cc!dream: * rambling and fast talking *
this is awesome
Wawawawawawa that wasn’t in the script that wasn’t in the script  I was laughing to damn hard
BRO WHEN TOMMY SAID "NO MUM I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER I'M LIVE" I FELT THAT SO HARD I STREAM LIKE A TON AND MY MOM IS ALWAYS YELLING "CAN YOU PLEASE EMPTY THE DISHWASHER" AHHHH THATS HILARIOUS
The TNT one had so much facial expression

Techo's "so long Theseus" at 2:46 hurts now. but in a not bad way I suppose...
6.9 million views, 696K likes. Nice.
2:46 replace "theseus" with "losers" and that is some sad for shadowing.
Bro I love Ranboo just absolutely pouring his heart and soul into the acting only for dream to just go "gimme a second" the moment he's done
0:24 start 0:49 that's one loose end (: 1:41 por tommy ;-; 2:19 SO LONG THESEUS 2:46 he was doing so well good job ranboo (:
r.i.p techno,                                 but how did SAD-ist caption the video at 2:46 as SO LONG THESEUS? what if SAD-ist knew his death?                                                                                      AMOGUS
HELP HELP HELP WHEN I WAS WATCHING THIS VIDEO, I WAS ACTIVELY PLAYING UNDERTALE SO THE MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
Did you actually get the dream smp to voice act
Can someone explain what these audios are made from? I’ve just been watching all these awesome animations from Sadist- what I gather is…. Minecraft streamers doing RP??? The animatics are SO GOOD- are the stories/streams actually as awesome???
6,969,485 views, 695k likes, 17k comments, 2.77M subscribers. Nice!!

I reaaaaaly like wilburs face in this vid 0:36 its so freaking funny
1:21 LOOK AT CHIBI SADDIST SHES SO CUTE
I like how Dream was glitching while Ranboo was talking because of the little discord problem
2:46 SAD-ist, I think you somehow called it.....
I love your art style
2:45 :(
"I can't empty the dishwasher I'm in the middle of a war mum!"
Tommy’s mom is cannon. I would know I’m the dishwasher
I love the idea that sadist is the camera woman just recording everything
My friends say my laugh is a mix of Tommyinnit and Jschlatt and after hearing Tommyinnit laugh several times in this video I can hear it
Absolute beauty ✨✨
ТАТАФАТАТАТА
you sound like BMO
"so long theseus".   -Technoblade:when tommy died
"I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM!"
My favorite one is when mom shouts to Tommy wash the dishes (sorry if my English wrong doesn’t know it well 😅
Is this true that you have them do a script
“I’m in the middle of a war!”
2:44     ayo wait wt-
2:32 I like how Tommy's laugh makes it look like he's actually dying from the lightning XD
I loved the bloopers
i want more of this like right now
sadist predicted it. Thesus misses you technoblade
And thats why Tommyinnits mom is canon
woah your voice is so nice also i love your dsmp videos they're awesome
Mom ruins the live stream XD
Bean
2:45 got me feeling awkward rn
Wilbur did not swear he said cut fyi
2:46 caught me off guard
¿Por que te pareces a Dream? (El diseño de tu personaje)
:( aw right before ranboo's blooper there is a screen...
The outro 🤣👍🏾
why are Tommy’s legs so long like I get he’s tall but no need to make him look like he has 3 pairs of high heels on lol
2:46 you'll notice an Easter egg to Techno's death
Very funny! Thank you for sharing.  If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
2:46 Tribute to Techno o7
Why do I see sadist as the camera woman
technoblade is dead
Tommy: Dont animate that SAD-ist: **Menacing pen lifting**
RIP techno💔
these are priceless, i can't!
I love the way tommy laughs
Was the "so long Theseus" edited?
2:46 how did you predict that?????
I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER MUM, IM IN A WAR
we need more bloopers
2:45 those few seconds of Technoblade..... idk what to say...
No way this was a year ago
Wait you script those animations with them???
technoblade died
2:46 so long, Techno...
We need more bloopers
2:54 sounds like George saying hello😸
🤣🤣🤣 I love this 🤣🤣🤣 keep up the great work dude!!
One of the best sad-ist videos out there
2:46 Dude... This hits hard rn
You Know What The Only Thing That Was Funny Is That When Dream Tries To Blow Up The Chest Tommy Looked Tall
I just noticed the so long nerds cut. WTF why was that there? RIP TECHNO. WE'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER
TOMMYS LAUGH IS SO FUNNYYY
2:46 "So Long Theseus" ...
Can you do a tribute to Technoblade pls, he deserves it
RIP Techno :(
MAKE Tribute to technoblade PLZ! RIP LEGEND! :(
Sadist, make a tribute to techno blade plz, I guess he deserves one…
Quick question, if you nearly died making this video then pin this comment
You look like core frisk if they were a dsmp fan
Tommy is literally dying every time
POV: you remember this was made over a year ago
So tomy is still a teen
Ghostbur: … Tommy: *casually gets struck by lightning*
SADist’s profile gets really funny when you imagine the frown as a beak or a nose
Tommy's laugh is an art form 😂😂😂
new rap wha what  what what what the
Lol this is amazing I love it and I would rewatch it over and over XD
dream: *frantically defending himself*  tommy: *deflating*
AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM
Ugh
the transitions between the game and irl are so cool omg
Dream:*blows up all of l’manburg* Also dream:*blow’s himself up while Tommy dies from lack of oxygen*
This makes me think the dsmp knows you… I’m probably being stupid
THE LITTE DANCES AT THE END :0
Hi
😂
0:50
im not even im the fandom anymore but i still love sadists videos
THE LAUGH!!!!🤣✨😭✋
Sadist I’m dissatisfied, U forgot to make a blooper of Tommy saying  “ *were you too KISSING?* “  (U can look it up, we’re u too kissing tommyinnit)
i watched a SAD-ist video a while ago (maybe 5 months ago) and i found it boring bc i hadnt watched more than 5 seconds (im impatient) but now ive seen this and i want to watch them all.
0:49 is like my mum finds my search history 😂😂
New sub
THE ONE WITH DREAM THO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:13 Me after 5 seconds of school
wilbur : i want to be brought back to life  Server: I BeG tO diIFfEr!
Not gonna lie, kind of wishing this video went on for the entirety of my life
What do you use to animate?
When Tommy got struck by lightning it reminded me of that one guy saying, "Strike me down Zeus! You don't have the balls-" XD IT'S SO FUNNY!!
R.I.P Dream died because he blowed himself up.
Imagine Wilbur see this
What's your prounce?
I love thqt when dream comes back on from being dead he face plants and then stands up
SO WAIT- THIS WAS ALL A FUCKING ALL ACT?! I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL FOR IT
Pls I love the tp animation for Dream 😂😂
We need another bloopers one please
Its gotten to the point where they know shes gonna use the audio so they fuck it up on purpose i cant -
1:07  NOOOO MY ST- ( a few seconds later) BURSTING  IN LAUGHTER
im sobbing this is so awkward dhshsvsjsjs
The fact that dream just faceplanted on the floor makes this 100% funnier

“I’m in the middle of a war mum”-Tommyinnt
I love how sadist has become known in the dsmp.
Cool
1:24 Dream and SAD-ist's face masks switch up on how they're really feeling.
“I WAS DOING SO WELL NOOO”
Dating Start! plus sponsor/merch reminds me too much of Alpharad
I actually felt like I was laughing with Tommy  :)
the little sadists dancing at the end,oma fudgin godd-
He was doing so well– NOOOOO—
LMAO I tried to put the Able Sisters theme every time a blooper happens.
Almost all them are tommy

UwU
That last one, tho.  That was one of the most awkward interactions I have ever seen, and I'm a naturally awkward person-
Absolute GOLD
Motherinnit: Can you empty the dishwasher? Tommy: I'm in a middle of a war mum Motherinnit: 👁👄👁

“Mum I’m at war!” Subtitles: Warm mummy
I love how Wilbur said hey sadist add this in and then you just bleep it out
I’m not sure if I’m correct but didn’t Wilbursoot have the idea of a bloopers video but still amazing as usual
This must be so awkward each time they do this and it’s soo funny
Had dream ever heard of flint and steel
My favorite character of the entire dsmp.... Will always be Tommy's mom interrupting his streams🤣
1:03 I just realized that Tommy is missing a shoe???
there needs to be another one of these the techno robot voice moment is priceless.... or the techno's loud keyboard....  just techno in general
Wait they know each other?
motherinnit
Yoo i think this is drista not sure but might be
I love how he says Bloopers, "Balopoopers"
love how the members literally talk to SAD-ist, its so cute
CANON CANON CANON CANON CANON -ranboo

I don't get it... is the DSMP scripted or improvised and what is SAD-ist's role? Sorry, I'm not fully grasping it
ranboo
Rip
Omg ! This video is funnyyyyyy :D
OK HAHAHAHAHAH 😂😂😂😂 DREAM TOMMY
0:55 you think if i scan that on spotify a song will apear?
Add the *TommyInnit suicides with an enderpearl* to the video. It’s gonna be a masterpiece
1:50 do you guys thing is this a bad or perfect timing?
Drista?
Dream Stan
I love how Sad-ist mostly added tommy's clips :)
Is that the conniver’s kuni from tf2 on your youtooz? Yoooooo
i just realized all of these except Ranboo's has Tommy in them
aaaaa now i wanna see all the streams these came from does anyone have the links??
im in the middle of a war mom
I love your cute you-tooz
Hi
1:10   *Dream blows himself up*  *TommyInnit was slain by his own laughter*
I love the fact that when everything is going by the "script" its all dramatic and when the blooper happens the characters just become outlines. great work BTW!
- _-
Ur a copy but have sad mask and a girl (From my sister)
Wait you are my brothers classmate???
thats my birth day :D
I like how you drew Dream with his face on the ground
i love you girl you are AMAGING <3
Why do all the bloopers always have Tommy to do with it? 🥲
Just realized SAD-Ist's a Wamen
I like the serious animation and how it just turn into a funny cartoon
i dont know you but u realy good in drawing so heres like and sub
the fact that some of these bloopers are staged makes it funnier
dream's emotes on his mask is funny
what is the music
Tommy’s laugh is everything.
What do you use to draw, like the app
Are we going to talk about the fact Tommy only had one shoe on?
i love ur video's
make another one pls
Sadist one question are you friends with them like are they actually doing the voic act like iam confused
sometimes i just wish, we can have sadist join the smp too, just narrating the story from far away, doing commentary ig? and and sadist and ccs meet up, that would be SOO COOL
Bloopers part 2 when
Petition to get Sadist into DreamSMP.
Man's rlly had to use one of the best Toby fox games of all time for this yootooz, Sheesh.
1:14 I guess Tommy would be the next Dream in terms of their laugh.
i worry for Tommy's throat sometime :')) doesn't it hurt, laughing like that ??
Even at death he still wears a mask
Use o tradutor Tommy ri que nem uma gazela tendo infarto
can i find the first bloppers anyere
I fricken love this video.i laughed so hard
i wish you do who broke it meme animation;]
"MUM IN IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM!"
Your voice is beautiful!
Here have some blue
dream: accidentally dies tommy and sad-ist: *dying of laughter*
Okay so i have no idea what Dream SMP is or ANYTHING thats going on... but the animation is great, the laughter is contagious, and im having a good time 😂💖
If my mum did that i would be fuming
Good animation
Tommy really said "with lungs full of ash"
I didn't knew dsmp was scripted.
Ok can we see a ranboo animac?
THAT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT!!!
I love that in the script dream and tommy have that sad evil dynamic but irl they’re so sweet
*Casually wheezes for 5 minutes straight after watching this* watching the is made me think that maybe close to every event in the Dream SMP might have been planned, though I doubt it. Also, it amazes me that Dream and Tommy actually sort of got along-
Can we just agree that Tommy is kettle-?
I laughed so much lol and like can we just appreciate that these animations are SICK!- like how do u do this?-
Tommy: do not animate that DO NOT-HAAH sad-ist: haha pen go brrrrrrr
The way you were recording just tryna get a good video here with some content 😔👌
Tommyinnit is like the only child in the world that has a valid excuse not to empty the dishwasher. XD
Plssss someone awnser this! Is she a fan or does she actually know them!?🥸🤪😍
"I'm in the middle of a war!"
I love sadist's voice, it is so much adorable dude why 😭.
Sadist be dying of laughter 1:22
hello talking sadist why arent you in your other videos?
Ok but like sadist is like the lixian of dream smp
Mum! I can't empty the dishwasher I'm live!  I died
Ranboo: *doing lore*  dream: my discord is lagging wait a min Ranboo: NOOO- *cries*
"Now, SAD-ist, also put this one in. CU-- [bleep]"
sadist looks like drista
Sorry, but the transition at 0:46 from Wilbur's skin to his irl self is amazing
The fact that I ever thought it was real☹️
1:32 dream literally fell when getting his stuff! HA!
Why do you have more subscribers than JackManifoldTV-
this video is so important to me
Just oof this make me laugh lolz!
This is sick
Lol 😂
I can’t believe you don’t have 10 mil btw how does it feel to carry the community?
Ranboo: why now why didnt you blow it up earlier... Dream:hold on, of course my discord breaks give me a second Ranboo:NO WHY I WAS DOING SO WELL
I love sad-ists voice it’s so calming.
whats the song's name my g?
I’m probably gonna need breathing treatments after this because of wheezing so much
"TAT WASN'T IN THE SCRIPT! THAT WASN'T INT THE SCRIPT!"
Yay
Sadist dancing animation is so cute!
Tommy looks so innocent
best animator on the internet.
Sadist dance     Sadist dance
"What the- that wa- what the-" 🤣🤣🤣
No one: Dream: blows himself up
Pov:no father figure
I'm in the middle of a war mum!! Me; (dies)
Mommy-innit
1:54-2:02 🤣
the tommy mum one is just WAY to relatable for me... btw u r so talented! :)
I love how everyone’s like:Sad-it’s don’t animate that part! Or just put in a blooper scene Or they are like: I WAS DOING SO WELL!!! AHHHH
love your voice
lamanberg face it your never geting my power tommy`s mum do i look like i need your power
Your a goat
Hahaha RANBOO was doing sooo good hashh
It's always Tommy LMAO 🤣
Haha sadist go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I know some of the quotes were from streams but was the Wilbur and Tommy in the beginning real?
Did you actually get them to say that?
They should put you in on the dsmp as the type of person who stalks everyone. You must know what everyone is doing. So basically dream but not as evil
SAD-ist: bloopers time! time to put tommy in almost everyone!    It's been 7 months and tommy still hasn't reacted
Can I use your art style please?
Can you do part two of bloopers pleaseeeee 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Most these got ♦TOMMYINNIT♦
If dream was an animator: this channel
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍
I’ve seen this a million times and it’s still hilarious
Your animation is wery cool

I forgot to sub to you
Hey guys remember the egg lore  Haha
TUBBO AND WILBUR REACTED TO THUS HOW MUCH PPL SAW THE VIDEO  |  | V
0:01 the music is Dating Start! From undertale if you wanted to know 👉👈
Just the perfectly cut Ranboo scream at the end.
The fact that almost all of the bloopers involve Tommy just proves Tommy is a pure influencer
CONGRATS FOR THE YOUTOOZ!
ME: *DIED   DSMP MEMBERS: ALSO DYING🤣
Umm I know your accent
sad dream 👌
Im just vibing with the mini SAD-ists dancing at the end.
"I CAN'T PUT THE DISHES AWAY! I'M IN A WAR MUM!!"
Motherinnit out her stopping wars be like motherinnit
lmao
HOW DO U HAVE THIS SKILL
In the part when dream blows himself up, put it in 0.25 speed, Tommy will but his entire body through a meat shredder
Immagine if wilbur pushed the botton at the wrong time, and be like: "o crap, it explode, looks like we have to build it back!"
“I’m in the middle of a war mum!”
This is epic!
Would you consider making a art tutorial ever?
gusto ko ang iyong mga guhit at sana makadrawing din ako katulad mo pagtanda ko, ate
Are you Lithuanian

In my head canon, sad-ist is the camera man so I adored that you included that
sad-ist NEED TO GO ON THE DSMP
0:56 hey😉😫🙏
Tommy f'''k badboyhalo laungugle
Omg your youtooz came out on my birthday
Tommy: Don’t animate that SAD-ist: *glances over at camera* well then…
ranboo  is so cute at 2:54
TommyInnit was in every single one, except for the last one, coincidence? I THINK NOT!!!
You should animate all the bloopers from the recent lore streams lmao. And also the “YEA DADDY DREAM”
I can’t stop dying today for some reason 👁👄👁💦 And the art is just and EVERYTHING is INCREDIBLY AMAZING
Your Youtooz comes out on my birthday
Lol i’m in the middle of a war right now I can’t the dishwasher
I just realized how weird it's going to be to hear Tommy without his voice crack
This was so funny XD
jajajajajajaja
I have to say, Dream getting himself killed was the funniest
the most dramatic thing in the world is two black bars
The new bloopers from the 28th… tommy accidentally dying and techno typing over sapnaps speech💀💀
I love when this happens and they break character.  You forget that the Dream SMP members aren't playing who they are in real life.  Dream is too much of a dork to be pure evil.
"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM, I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER"
More bloopers plzzz
WTF
Can’t wait to see the newest one hopefully
Sad-ist I have good news, More bloopers today.
@skoppy same
I love tommy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Tommy: DONT ANIMATE THAT  SAD-ist: *no words can stop me, they have no meaning to me*
You got to meet them 😯      Awesome
SAD-ist: draws a masterpiece   Me: Has to search how to draw a circle   view more…
listening to tommy laugh physically hurts me
man im too late for the buying XD
Best Minecraft animator
Nice
MY THI- *oh he ded* 1:12
In that blooper where Dream exploded, SAD-ist and Dream's masks should be switching because of their emotions.
Hahahahahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ranboo: ' i was doing so well?!'   Me: 'oreo boy what have you done to yourself-'  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What software so you use to make theses
I was dying at the dream explodes part lol
I wish there where more bloopers this made me laugh
Sad-ist a filipina
"Im in the middle of a war mum!"
2:53 3:19
What's the stream called when dream blew himself up ❓
when they sub to you
Soon sadist will join dream smp :D
im so sorry but do you know what sadist means it means:
Ranboo looks so cute
Tommy: please don't animate that.  SAD-ist be like: in one ear and out the other and only comprehending 'please animate that'... SO I SHALL! 🤣👌
LMFAO this is great!!
*"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM-"* -Tom Simon (Aka, TommyInnit)
Does the stylus work aswell? :c
OfficialFicho was here
The chances of being struck by lightning is just- I don’t even know- 1 in 1 TRILLION?!?! Legend says I still laugh at it to this day.
"NO MUM, I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER I'M LIVE!!!" -Tommyinnit R e l a t a b l e
lol
Sheesh, they’re running out of fourth walls to break at this point!
sad-ist is in my top 10 best animators list!
Dream is Dead for real he’s not in the prison he’s sitting in the afterlife because he lost one of his lives from the explosion and lost two of his lives due to Tommy 1:13
WAIT WHY YOU  Talk like DREAM SISTER
Hey
It’s so funny can’t stop watching
2:59 Im a mature person.
Dream say THAT WASINT IN THE SCRIPT mad my morning even better XDDD
Your youtooz came out on my b day and I got it
"MUM I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER IM LIVE" -tommyinnit
c*m, wilber's catchphrase.
Dream: ~dies by accident~  Tommy: ~laughing~  Sad-ist: ~ *dying* ~
why dream is fat in your wideo
The only thing I like about this ending is  Sad-ist dancing.
Can someone tell me how I can watch the whole smp from the beginning???
Dream: imma blow up Tommy's items  Dies: no that wasnt in the script!
Do one with the "NOW DIE LIKE ONE" but then the wither thing fails
RIP dream : died from filming a sad video
I LOVE HOW DREAM'S ARROW IS PERFECTLY ON TIME TO THE GAME NOISE HOLY FU--
when wilbur screamed C- i cried, it was so funny
This is so cool
Tommy: Do not animate that- You: still continues to animate it and i love you vids btw :))
Tommy: do not animeit that  Sadist: well woops
Me trying not to be loud sense it's 12 am and I don't want to wake up my whole family
This video shows Dream you’re a NG actor
Just why
Hey I question what do you sue for animation? :p
SAD-ist did you actually met the dsmp before the lore
dream: hold on one secound Ranboo: *laughs*  I WAS DOING SO WELL NOOOOOOOOOO
The precious dancing sad-ists at the end are just *chef's kiss

Imagine being in a war then still having to empty out the dish washer I rlly forgot that Tommy is 17 XDDD
These are the best parts that remind us that this is all a fun little roleplay for us all to enjoy
MUM IM LIVE
woah talking sadist
sadist has the most detailed animations at 3:12 when dream lags he actually distorts... sadist, I got one word for this video        *supercalifragilisticexpiladocious*
Смех Томми - отдельный вид искусства ХD
Wait what
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT A YOUTOOZ? YOU'VE EVOLVED!
I, too, laugh like Tommy when something funny happens XD
is sad ist girl?
this was posted on my birthday
Immagine commanding a whole army in a war and your mum calls you while you're on the battle field
Can u do animation titorials
Why do you sound like drista
Tommy striked by lightning is the best hahaha. let's thank Dream for that hahahah
are you like actually working for them?
many months later and this is still amazing
'Moooooom! I'm in the middle of a waaaar.'
The scenes where Tommy and Wilbur change from characters to IRL them are so smooth like- omg  This is so amazing- it really shows the fun of the roleplay, how different the people are out of characterz
I love how SAD-ist is having a break down  1:20
I love how good it is and the fact that you make it more funny then it already is says alot about you I love it <3
Oh boy, The SMP went off the rails for this one
Bruh my friend was pretending to be you. I apologise and make sure to keep up the amazing work
and ppl say the SMP is toxic they act it its all scripted theyre actually really nice to people off camera
Ghostbur: I want you to revive me, Tommy.  and God be like *HA LIGHTING GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*
best exuse to get out of chores, MUM IM LIVEEEE
ITS MY TIME TO PUT IT ON MY SHOOOSEE
hi :D
Waiting for the day SAD-ist offically joins the DSMP, with how much they know about her  (If not the cameraman, she's a straight up Historian/Lore-keeper, just keeping track of the history for everyone like me who can't watch the entire series XD Too many viewpoints and WAY too many episodes)
Not making fun of you but you sound like BMO from Adventure Time
I love how nearly every blooper has tommy lol
I was having a  try-not-to laugh challenge with my guy Mcyik and I lost within 5 seconds. THAT IS HOW FUNNY THIS VIDEO IS. Awesome job, SAD-ist.
I hqve only have one word "underated"
I like how Sadist is holding a pen to animate and the drawing is so cute 2:17 good job on making great animations
Tommys mom: calls for help  Tommy: MOM IM IN A- IM IN A MIDDLE OF A WAR  Litterly have me down on the ground LOL cause like imagane a robber is robbing a bank and hes phone ring and its hes mom i would laugh and he would say " MOM IN A MIDDLE OF A ROBBERY REMEMBER"
1:15 we love Tommy scream laughing
I love this so much lmao
Wait r those the real dsmp members?
Tommy may be a human Lightning rod.
Tommy: "Do not animate that!" SAD-ist: **animates that anyways**
I am dying😭
main character
I swear your the best animator ever! all you ever hear in me and my friends discord calls is "Did SAD-ist post anything?" "Is there a SAD-ist video we didn't watch yet?" "SAD-ist this, SAD-ist that" its amazing 🤣
WHY DO YOU SOUND SO MUCH LIKE MY FRIEND AMYAHHH U89DYNRS8ARTXAV6FIH YNTIOGJFDIOHIGIRTBJKVIPSIopaepHGC
0:32 now that is a bloopers scene, i laughed as hard as tommy  3:20 poor ranboo, he did so well and then dream's discord breaks... *R.I.P* Ranboo
tommys laughs sound like hes dying!
i am crying its so funny!
NO CUZ THE HAMILTON REFFERENCE IN THE YOUTOOZ IS MY FAV YGH I WISH I COULD BUY IT
1:9 🤣
a                                    w                                    e                                            s                                          o                                                 m                                                             e
The bloopers show that these stories are not real and even though that’s kinda bad, it means that all the bad things that happen aren’t real
Is dream your brother
The way Ghost Dream covers His Face with Embarressment After the Blast............ So CUTE
If she added the dancing cocoa roach, it would be 10x the vibe check  Sad-ist has already passed the vibe check many times, as ap she is professional
Sorry but that one scene with Dream and  Tommy. Why are his legs longer that his torso? Well I mean it is pretty accurate
1:32 I love how dream comes in a picks up his stuff omg
ummm people tell me I sound like you SAD-ist
The fact that Tommy’s mom called him XDDDD
this made me so happy
*I’m in a war mum!*
2:02 I’m in the middle of a WAR mum 😂😂😂😂
Why do you low key sound like Faline San?
1:25 dream screaming that wasn't in the script *2  I was laughing so hard
Dude someone tell dream to let sadist  on the smp everyone loves her content and the fans
Wait do you actually talk to them im a new sub
Why does every blooper usually happen to tommy
I was hoping dream getting attacked by a baby zombie on a chicken would be in here lol
I don't know why but I feel saddest is like dream sister or her best friend
Is that ur voice sounds nice
It's like a girl wearing sad dream mask :3(the youtooz)
I love how Tommy just flipping lost it every time
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Blooee
WHEN DREAM GOT BLOWN UP THO 😭😭😭😭
What's the real all video?
This is not your video u copy cat
do you get them to voice rescored?
I’ve rewatched this a billion times and I was saying hi to sad-ist and whatever and my mum thought I was on FaceTime
i love how tommy is every single one but the last
It's funny that how short sadist is here
2:17..Tommy: PLEASE DO NOT ANIMATE THAT!           Sad-ist: WHOOOPS
I love how on the 2nd one u can hear the dono sound 😂
This video never gets old
I like your voice SAD-ist
holy shit this came out three days after mah birthday          how did i miss this-
Chibi Sadist dancing is something I never knew I needed
do another one of these videos there has to be more bloopers since this came out
Lol
There is also another blooper of where Wilbur is talking with dream in the 2nd war and when Tommy shows up and tells Wilbur to give him something dream steps in and Wilbur says "GO DADDY DREAM!" and Tommy dies and dream looks back at Wilbur like bruh what did you call me? And Wilbur says wait no uh go leader dream or how about go big brother dream no no no no *bigass breath* no
Ok no one is giving enough credit to how smooth the Game/irl transitions were
Tommy: **is battling dream in the vault** MottherInit: TOM EMPTY THE FRICKING DISHWASHER! WHAT? YOUR IN MIDDLE OF WAR? I DONT CARE
Awesome!!
tommy's laugh:  ppppppHHHHHIIIIHAH
Damn Tommy has a dishwasher? And his parents don’t come up the stairs to beat him when he doesn’t listen? Now I wish I was him.
SAD-ist are you drista
The awkwardness ranboo and dream had LOOL
Dream: That wasn't in the script! THAT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT  Tommy: *JUST STRAIGHT UP DYING*
I like how the black bars disappear when they’re out of character
damn bro thats crazy
Beautiful outro im starting to simp holy sh*t
Are you a filipina?
tommy is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            everywhere(pls dont ban my account)
Bruh, 4 months later and i hear dream sounding like daniel avidan at 2:54
What if drista is SAD-ist
Your cool
I have a feeling you're ...........
You look like Sad Dream
why your mask is sad
*dream opens chest* *ammidiantly put TnT on the chest* *Use's Bow to Ignite the TnT* *dream blows up* Me: *THATS THE MOS FUNNIEST CLIP I'VE EVER SAW* 🤣
what do you use to animate this stuff?
Sad-ist pull a techno and whenever you animate Tommy he has to buy your youtooz
Dream really wants to stick to the script
Tommy: I can't do the dishes Mom Ó╭╮Ò😡😡😡😡😡
this is so good and funny
I WAS DOING SO WELL  I feel that It’s always when you got it together that someone else doesn’t
Hmm that undertale song
WHY ARE THER ALL TOMMY BAHAHAHA
Is this the girlfriend of dream?
i love your animations 🙁
wilbur was screaming the c word
Tommy:MY DISC NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOO Dream:UH NO NO THAT WAS NOT IN THE SCRIPT The disc: IF I DIE YOU DIE MY LIFE IS LIKEND TO YOUR LIFE
Why does she sound like drista?
OKAY BUT WHY IS SADIST ADORABLE THO
MUM I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR
Tommy:DO NOT ANIMATE THAT!  Sad-ist:*grabs pen  s l o w l y* *what was that ?*
Best video on youtube
I love this i want a part 2
What program du you use to make these amezing animations!
How long did you make the animation?
Bro..like this is the funniest thing ever!! 😂😂
SAD-ist is too short for the camera stand🤣
what animation app do u use?
(i mean this totally as a compliment btw) YOU KIND OF SOUND LIKE B-MO FROM ADVENTURE TIME
1:28 poor sadist, who is struggling to make this animation...
1:52 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I cant empty the dishwasher now mum, im live! Im in the middle of - a war mum!"  - Tommyinnit
Rip tommys lungs
Istg wilbur with his glasses is a whole different breed
Tommy fighting for his life   Tommy's mother: come empty the dish washer!   Tommy: I can't!   😂😂
Why did I think that Wilbur was going to say "Tommy I want you to draw me like one of your French girls" like why was I thinking of that lol 😂🤣  2:24
Drean ruined Ranboo's drama scene😂
whats up with his wheezing
Motherinnit really adds to the dream smp storyline
Can you speak tagalong
well she just did animate that.
Lol
Bruh when the lightning hit why didn’t tommy disintegrate.
You inspired me to do most of my series on my channel :)
i did not know that they voice acted for you! also my FAV one is hog hunt!!
LMAOAJ
What is the name of the song at the end?
They're like the fandom:  *N E E D I N G  T H E R A P Y*
Plot twist: SAD-ist is drrrrrrrrrista
HE WAS LIVE
I know it’s late but how did you get the dsmp to say ur name? And,               What platform do you use to animate?! It’s soo cool.
Tommy was really shocked when wilbur said "tommy i want you to bring me back to life
Proof the Dream smp is scripted
you should start a second channel with basic animation commentary
:0 YESSSSS
How to get away with doing chores   IM IN A MIDDLE OF A WAR MOM
Pro-nouns?
OMG XD I DIDNT REALISE THEY GAVE YOU THE AUDIO CLIPS I THOUGHT YOU JUST TOOK THE AUFIO CLIPS FROM THE ACTUAL THING 😂😂
This is amazing
What video is all this in i wanna Watch it 🥺
What video is this in?
ok For one thing, You are INCREDIBLE at animating. the second, BAHAHAAHAAHHAAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
nobody: tommy when he laughs: WAHHHHGGGHAH *weird cough*   love ur animations btw<3
3:29 click this time lapse and tell me if you feel wholesomeness
i think we all need to go touch grass
Tommy: MY THI- dream: *floats out of exploded body*
TommyInnit is obviously the one with the most bloopers.
0:49 When Tommy said "My Things-" the suspense when he saw dream died 🤣🤣🤣
I love the lil sads at the end
So that is how they read the script while recording on discord I have always wanted to know
I love how Sad-ist's avatar is always so cheerful and energetic and yet she wears a sad mask. xD
I CAN’T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER I’M LIVE
What is your opinion on so many of the dsmp members reacting to and loving your animations?
Do you clip part of videos or do you ask Tommy and his friends to voice act? (Me and my sis have been fighting over this XD)
hi
Anyone here after “final waltz”
Ur having a YooTooz sounds like ur having a baby (jk sry).
I had to turn my volume down cos Tommy's laughter was making my eardrums bleed 😃🔫
I like your happy/sad dance ;D
ik you are drista
Pixar animation? indeed, she doing a movie? indeed ofc
Cool :D your growing so fast :D
•/•   U
Your the fuckin best like literally your the bomb
This always make my day
How did you get a U2 seem like a couple months
I like how when Dreams discord was having a problem, he was slightly glitching, did anyone else notice that?  It’s the little things in life 😌
Wait wait this is not in the script waitttttt
I love how Tommy got ToAsTeD in the middle of the conversation with ghostbur
this is amazing >xD
pls i nead to know is the dream smp skripted?
This is hilarious 😂😂👌
God, Tommy's laugh is so infectious....
I thought that she took the voices from peoples streams and imported them into a video
I find Tommy more main character than Ranboo lmao
Sadist litterally is the Dream Smp camera person
HAHAHA THAT WAS EPIC!!!!
I like how it goes from cinematic to normal when there are bloopers
EVERY TIME IT GETS ME TOMMY'S LAUGH MAN
why does tommy have such a funny laugh i love it
BAHHAHAHAHAHA
love this sm
1:30 I just noticed that Dream falls over before grabbing his stuff.
This was fun
Tommyinit in minecraft DSMP: A Child whose doesn't know who's right and wrong and betrayes those that help him (Expect for Tubbo)  Tommyinit In real life: Makes bloopers that happen off camera or live stream. Fun guy to laugh with in parties!
The ending is so cute
I love how u drew dreams dead body face flat on the floor
outro song is "Kevin Macleod - Hard Boiled" known as the wilbur song :)
R u happy or sad????????...
IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM💀
I’m so sad I couldn’t get this figure
Your animations are sickk
“no i cant empty the dishwasher mom!”  *”im being prosecuted”*
Bahaha this is amazing!
Classic Tommy, interrupting Ghostbur by getting struck with lightning while he’s in the middle of saying something deep😒 “i don’t want” what? plz finish
Is this the original audio or a different video?
we need the animation of awesamdude accidentally killing dream in the prison  pretty pleaseee
why does dream manipulate some many children
y the f is undertale music getting popular and popular after i finish the game?
"so long theseus" xD
Cringe
Wait wait do they voice act for you? :O Or do you just take sentences from their vids and lives?
Wilbur: BRIIING MEEE TOOO LIIIIFEE (Bring Me To Life is a song btw)
I’m gonna watch all of the things
Wilbur: *CVM!-* Tommy: *Dying* SAD-ist: *Disappointment*
I’m not a dream smp fan but like the storyline and the animations are fire
Tbh U Sound Like Scottis/Filipino I CANT-😭
How about the eggs
Tubbo is watching this rn
Tommy’s laugh is so funny 😭
Sadist sounds super non-english mmm interesting
this video brings me back... that ranboo stream was actually the first stream i watched. i tuned in right at this part
:D
tha- boy- that boi sus-            ty for the likes ig-
1:46 Tommy inside Tommy
Drista
Wait sadist are you crista
I love how Wilbur addresses Sad-ist 🤩
You need to do a part 2 if you can  This was amazing and hilarious
Sad? Bloopers. Sad no mor! Bloopers end. Sad again.
No one talking about the Hamilton on her youtooz
i love sad-ist being portrayed as a lil cameraman
that transition from the game to his setup is so clean
Ngl the lighting was a great affect especially with the timing, until it actually hit Tommy XD
Nice bloopers...
Bro what if sad-ist was a 4th dimension being watching the dream smp
I love the way Ranboo acts in lore. I mean he has to act with his voice and express feelings with it while others like tommy can do that with facial expressions. This video is amazing !!!!
TOMMYS LAUGH IS NOT OK OMG
Over
So LoNg ThEsEuS
Bwoopahs
I wish i cloud draw like you  :(
i personally forgot sadist was a real human
Ok-
I just realized it sounded like Tommy was about to say he’s in the middle of a “scene” but then corrected himself to say “war” so he wouldn’t be breaking character too hard lmao
C*M!  - Wilbur soot 2021
if u ever make a blooper video again you should do a complication of technoblade asking for join memberships
So smooth-
Techno be like: So long Theseus
I like the little Hamilton painting in the youtooz
the fact that yall are friends is so cute to me
2:16 Timmyinit: Please, Do not animate that. Sad-list: *nothing can stop sad-list*
I sometimes have the feeling you are drista lmao
I love it SAD-ist
poor Tommy this entire video LMAO Tommy is the best
100% NEW TECHNOBLADE SHE NEVER UPLOADS NEW technoblade
It's just a coincidence or the majority of clips has Tommy in them?
I like the hidden reference to techno's reaction from the other side of the map
DSMP: *in war*  Sadist: *teaching us how to dance perfectly*
How does one explain that theyre currently fighting a war to their parents
Ok well thats funny every time again BUT CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT HOW EPIC GHOSTBUR IN THE RAIN LOOKS. pls.
HE WAS DOING SO WELLL
I watched all of you're dream smp animations, i like everything from the song to animation. (Sorry for my grahams English is not my first language.)
Me: *See’s the into* Also me: “Animation Start!”
Fucking Tommy getting lightning striked
Tommy: i in a middle of a war mom?!?!
Wilbur soot: co****
This my first time hearing their voices Woahhh
Your youtooz is sold out 😭😭😭😭😭😢
This is better than the actual thing
:)))))
I love bloopers xD
1:33 He sounded like Donald duck.
Mum said y'all are gonna have to pause the war because the dishwasher needs to be emptied
Bloopers, everyone having a blast while SaD-Ist is dying in the inside.
Wait- I’m confused we’re they just being funny and talking about  you on stream? Or were you talking with them 😂
ranboo stuttering is everything to me 😟
i found you because i searched up a random name in the interlopers trailer. i did not regret.
Why are u saaaaaaaad
YES
Laighing simulator
WAIT-YHU GOT TO SEE DREAM SMP!?
I hope sadist joins the smp
I love how sadist is filming them
I love the Ranboo scene *WHEEZE*
▀ ▀▄ ▄ ▄▀
omg ur ranboo design is do good
U r dreams fan I know it
aww she missed technoblade reading his chat with dream
You deserve everything you have :)
I love how every blooper contains Tommy.
i tink it betor to mek drem a blob1!1!1!1
Im to sick to laugh so every time I try to laugh I just cough- 🙃
Wilbur: Bring me back to life Tommy: *is struck by lightning* God: Hoe don't do it...
ticket to dream smp
:D
Wait , that was actually recorded with the dream team???
Patata
So those were roleplay?
No one will forget the amazing and SUPER iconic Dream death.
1:28 BAHAUGGHH
PLEASE UPLOAD
I love how when the things get less serious it gets less detalled and the color gets clearer
"mum i cant empty  the dishwasher im live im in a middle of a war mum what the f$#@" make me whezee in pain
this is so funny XD
Every time when tommyinnit streams he laugh and wezzle hard it busted my eardrums
I absolutely love the transition from DSMP Wilbur to IRL Wilbur.
The most hilarious parts were British boi gets struck by lightning and Blob thing just blow himself up.  Change my mind
Just because I’m curious… what do you do for a job? Is it just YouTube or do you animate for something else- or is it even animation?
Me:epik  Also me: wait this was scripted?
I’m laughing so hard about this bloopers XD
the ending is so cute omg
Wait you're a girl?!?!?!
Okay, I offically have to watch this. Can someone help get me started? Like, from the begining?
1:12 MY THIN- *dream kills himself*
Tommy’s laugh is priceless
You Are a God of animation Sad-ist i wanna be  Great animations Like you :D
FunFact: SAD-ist is...in fact...a bit older than Tommy.
im laughing so much
You are sooo cute 🥰🥰
2:46 So long Theseus!
1:22 tommy laugh i keep repeating BAAAAHAH * silence *  * breathe * BHAAAHH
2:41 tommy summoning the wtf word: THE WATTA WATTA TA
“I was doing so well, noooooo-“ I don’t think I can accurately describe how much I relate to this sentence, especially considering the fact that for *some reason* it’s *only* when I’m doing really well with voice acting and stuff that somebody else in whatever RP it is abruptly pauses and says “Sorry, gotta go turn off the AC” and I just have to sit there; praying I can say the dialogue that well again 😅
Ngl uou kinda sound like drista
ah yes, dream 10,000 iq
Canonical Camerperson, love it!
bro shes so good at amimatining like i think most woman are very good at art i like suck at it
XD
Mother said it was my turn to be pinned :(
Enderman: Do not look at me  Ranboo: *screams in the dirt*
YOU ARE AWESOME                             SERIOUSLY AMAZING
Notice how almost all of these happened when tommy was around.
i realy wanna se a full movie of your animation but i dont want you to stay up so late to make the animation :)
Sad-ist is the most talented dsmp animator i have ever seen bro
Cool outro
I love the little sprites at the end.  So cute
I love SAD-IST as a little cameraman- just casually recording emotional and stupid moments
whats the name of the song at the end of the video?
bruh I always wondered who the person behind the camera was
1:31 THIS MADE ME LAUGH UNCONTROLLABLY FOR SOME REASON  HIS FACE
Somebody stole your art completely, and people were asking them to credit you and they haven't
Sad-ist should be in the dream SMP!
Tommy:"And as I w a saying  DON'T ANIMATED THAT! "
Wait what? Sad-ist  animator is a cheek?
2:22 even God thinks that’s a terrible decision.
nobody: absolutely nobody: the auto-generated subtitles at the very end: *YOU*
u sound like beemo from adventure time !! :D
1:22  Drista: My bro just died why are you laughing tommy?!
why is no one talking about the undertale music at the start
I'm in the middle of a war, mummy!  -Tommy 2020
1:05 tommy slender man
I love this so much, especially the Sad-ist cameraman just makes it 300x better
I just realized SAD-ist isnt verified on yt? What kinda drugs are the people working at yt on
IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM😂😂
She sounds so cute
TECNO SUPPORT
Sadist question, what do you use to animate?
Motherinnit has become one of the smp members
“As I was saying, this nation.” the words of Tommy..
tommy got struck by lightning and my broken lamp turned itself to full brightness for the first time in days what the fuck
WHERE ARE U
your youtooz is definitely the best i've seen
Love how she includes herself recording the scene lol
IM LITERY DYING OF LAUGHING THAT TOMMY SAID: MOM I CANT EMPY THE DISHWASHER CUZ IM LIVE!! ,I was literally dying in there like my dad coughed me in 12:06 AM;-; but when im sad this calms me down ♥️♥️
0:43 lmao I love the style shift when Wilbur breaks the fourth wall
please this made me laugh louder than tommy XD
SO LONG THESEUS! Funniest part of the entire video
I love how Tommy just slowly deteriorates with each frame at 2:42 xD
Have you ever wondered why tommy laughs at the top of his lungs
Hey Sad-ist I hope you see this but I heard you graduated for FlipaClip? And I use it.... Anyway Do you animate with FlipaClip? (My dream is to be an animaotr and I am not telling you the other one lol)
We didn’t get enough Sadist ghostbur and Ranboo 😩👏👏👏
1:12 MY THING-
:D
Lol
Hello
Dancing sadist is a vibe
you should do a ranboo arc video lol
lol
Why do I keep replayin' this video lol
I love how they have the SAO menu
"MUM I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR" 🤣
You Should Do The Egg On The dsmp.
Gasp  This is the first I've heard Sad-ist's voice holy shit
At this point you're just a official member of the smp
"Please do not animate that"😂😂😂 is the funniest line
cool
Why is it when Tommy laughs that he sounds like a cat with a hair ball in his throat?
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND MADE ME LAUGH
How do you animate so well??? Give me some tips!
"I'M IN A WAR MUM" has got to be the best Tommy quote of all time
When ur in a middle of a war         Ur mom :empty the dishwasher
Dream: why is this available to watch nooo
came here to find some happiness after reading passerine
IS THIS DRISTA?
Sadist this is a request  Make a dream's  video like technoblade's you did ok
still gold
you voice likes drista bruh
this was awesome
Pfffffft lmao
You should make an animation of the time tommy got stuck in prison with dream!!
1:31 can we just take a moment and appreciate the fact that he fell on his face first i cant-
I love that moment when tommy was lying
1:50 is the best 😂 I'm dying
SO LONG, THESEUS
C***
IM BWGGING YOU DO A EGG DSMP ANIMATION!!
I just realized Sad-ist actually drew Ranboo with an enderman mouth (blends when closing their mouth) Nice detail...
I don't really wanna be offensive but like...        I can hear the Filipino tone from her voice
what do you use to animate
this should be just tommyinnit animated comp
Undertale рулиии ттт
This is funny I think lol
Would it be ok if I used some of your drawing styles?
Tommy has been in all of them except the last one
I was wheezing harder than tommy watching this
You have a nice voice! (Just wanted to say that)
3:28
What you use for your animation
If there’s a part two I wanna see Techno screwing up the wither
That transition though.  0:45 btw  *chefs kiss*
lol
Watching this even though I know what will happen still makes me laugh
Yes daddy dream should have been there😂😂😂
SAD-IST IS A GIRL!!???
Sad-ist sounds like drista like she does right GUYS?
Comfort video
Tommy: plz do not animate that. Sad-ist: No
I don't even know Tommy has a sore throat lol
I can’t help but notice that tommy is in most of the bloopers
YEAH? I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER MUM IM LIVE! -TommyInnit
she should do hermitcraft next lol mycelium resistance
Dream Died!!!😹👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👋👏✋🖐
Please do more of these
Dream smp is cringe
What it's a sad-ist is a she?
Wow
What drawing software do you use :)
toMmY tHe T e a  KeNnEl *WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZES*
Ranboo is lengthy boi
Sad-ist has vocal cords what the fu
Cool but the same time its funny
2:09 those captions
what software/hardware do you use to make this masterpiece?
Pls no hate but what are these bloopers from
So u r a  girl i thought u were a boy 😁😁😝😋
Poor Ramboo he was doing well 🥲
Yes I am procrastinating so I will be watching all your videos :)
I come back here from time to time lol, loving it
YEESSSS THE MOM MADE IT IN
ITS A WOMAN
no.
I just love the vibe music and the little sad-ists it's too adorable-
Grabe te magaling ang pagkakanimate. Galing mo te 💛🤍💙❤️
I would just like to say, I love how you draw Tubbo. He just has these giant eyes, compared to the rest of the characters who have little lines or dots for pupils. It really just makes him look like the cute bees he loves :) Also, I really like IRL Wilbur that was just funny. I just remembered. Ranboo has the same eyes! It's just perfect, they are canonically married, like best friends, and have quite similar personalities too. I just really like these animations. Then there's Techno. It's Techno, he's just too good, perfect mask, perfect expressions. :) pls continue to animate this stuff I love it.
this was hallarious
The outro..., *IS SO CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE!!!*
I though sadist edited scenes and animate them I didn’t know you got the were on a script
dream and tommy sound like tea kettles
they are sold out u know
I WANT TO SUB TWICEEEEE
“I’m in a middle of a War mom”  Me: Try saying that to my Grandpa
Ur sub count is underrated
Cool
what app do you eddit with
oh yeah and sad-ist put this in COCK
2:15: Tommy:please do not animate that- Sad-ist: (animates)
God bless yall remember Jesus loves you
Shoulda added techno's "wither" incident.
What app do you use for the animation
I love dream's glitch affect when his discord breaks. The details are so good!
I Loved That Dream Messed Up Exploding Tommy`s Stuff
Tommy: Please don't animate that  SAD-ist: So anyway.. I started animating
*and this was all canon folks*           for the sake of people in my comment section in case people find this, yes this wasn't actually canon
1:14  Me:just laughing my head off
this video is absolute chaos
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂 😂😂
This is so funny! Laughing My Ass Off!!!!
Hey idk if you will say yes but can I use your animation for a video it's fine if not😅🙂
Tommy tryna Cough his Lungs Out when he's Laughing
I think sad ist should join dream smp
Poor Ranboo XD I can relate
You should make a dream smp movie! i dont care how long it takes, take your time if you do make it. i get that animation takes a long time. Thanks for reading whoever is reading this.
the best animation of them all
This video: 95%: Tommy laughing 5%: ranboo
If you want a good laugh watch this
What app do you use to make your animations? If you don't mind me asking
Dream: *blows up Tommy's stuff* Dream: *dies* Everyone: *W H E E Z E*
War can do many things to a man it also stops them from emptying dishwashers
Tommy : DO NOT ANIMATE THAT  SAD-ist: WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? ANIMATE IT? OK
2:30 **gets struck by lightning** ”PFFFFFFFFFFFF PAAAHHUGHHAHAAHHWGHUAAAAHHHGHHHhhWHHHuUhhHhHHGHH” **choking smoker sounds**
plot twist sadist made the dream smp
2:00 get out of my room im playing minecraft
ADD DREAM VS TUBBO AND TOMMY WITH MY WAR
0:25
I love how Tommy comments on almost every single animations of sad-ist.
1:54 “I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER,IM LIVE!” 2:28 *what* 2:45 *perfectly cut out scream* 0:36 CU- *beep*
sadist filo?
Can we just talk about how smooth is dream animated and how beautiful the outro with dancing sad-ist is?
1:31 he roll
what do you use to animate?
I love the detail that in the funny moments,sadist censors curses and crude humour,but in the actual animatics,she doesn’t censor anything out because it would remove from the experience
4:12 WAS FUNNY AF         who ever clicks the time stamp your clumsy
Is nobody gonna talk about how sadist is this cameraman person who is like: What are these idiots doing?I don't get paid enough for this-
My husband is screaming :’) at me from the kitchen because I’m listening to this on high volume. Help.
You're Youtooz Looked so SAD It's amazing 😭
Tommy: ..Dream? Are you ok? (Dream starts placing TNT) Tommy: Oh no no no no-(explosion) MY THING-(realizes Dream blew up as well) Dream and Tommy: (wheezing) Dream: Ahh, ahh, that wasn’t in the script, that wasn’t in the script, THAT WASN’T IN THE SCRIPT-
I don't like how tommy laugh
Why does everyone in this video have the comedy skills of technoblade
My biggest hope is that there will be an animatic of techno going into the prison for dream, like sam leading him through and dream screaming its a trap
I just love how Tommy is in all but one of them🤣🤣
I love the transitions from ingame to irl
Tommy ‘s laugh never dies
You should make a jump in the Cadillac 🤣
At 10:4 Tommy has long LEGS
Tommy laughs like “ BHUA HA HA BHUA HA HA AEAGA BHUA HA HA AH JDOEWJDSQJONDJD
I love that Dream uses a bit of deadpan humour when he says “-something- (awkwardly pauses for a few seconds) Of course my discord breaks at this moment. One second.”
the mask:  :( sadist:   :D
1:20 That wasen't at the script Sad ist : cries
Bloopers are funny, but what's more funny is that I got a Raid Shadow Legends Advertisement by Ninja LMOAKDIEOJESCKV
Does anyone know what they use? To like animate and shit? Apps wise?-
Tommy is in almost. Every. Single. One.    He’s a blooper boy.    Edit: IM FAMOUS!! Tysm for more likes than Eret! (Love you Eret)
Tommy is just made to be struck by lightning
Hahahaha lol
That pinky is so small and weak did he smash his pinky between a door or something 2:43
Tommy laughs like a crack addict lmao
Sadist should do an animatic on the eggpire
Sadistooz is cute btw
Ranboo is like me and the clip was with him with mixed emotions.
90% has tommy 10% tommy not there
This is the best sad-ist animation yet
Could anyone tell me the name of this song she uses in the beginning 0:02
Hi
sorry
😶
Next On @SAD-ist Animations To Dream SMP, Animate But With Colors
1:12 THIS JUST IN! Famous minecraft speedrunner and streamer Dream just F*cking died!
Sadist I really want to see what you do behind the scenes of animating can you make a video about it?
POGcHAmp
The laughing thou LMAO
I have a question: what was it like being a big fan of the dsmp then figuring out they all have actually seen all your animations ,made videos on them, and talked about you! How does that feel and what was your reaction 😊🙂
"Now Sadist, put this one in. *swears loudly*"
YOUTOOOOZ
2:47 jep Techno
Ha ha ha. I love watching this over and over again. But one thing I wish made it in here was techno placing the wither skull in the wrong spot 😂
Your youtooz is solo cute!
thats undertale! music
you should make a dream smp movie
i love how they know your gonna animate this, and they try to fuck it up on purpose t mess with you
at 1:03 my heart broke just because Tommy was missing a shoe in your Exile design. Not the lore. Not the expressions. (Though they did partially break my heart when you did other animations) Just the missing shoe. I cried. I was like, "NuUuUuU, nOt ThE sHoEeEeEe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!1!!!1!!!11!!11111"  And at 2:24 when his new "Doomsday" design is revealed, like, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh IT'S SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone take note: There is only one clip in this without tommy in it. I think it's a sign.
Can't wait til we start to get these in color
I love how adorable sad-ist makes ranboo look
I like how the acting is SO GOOD when their making a emotionally charged moment but then they can break down laughing a second later-
Okay, all of these voice clips and this whole video are so funny
You should make an anime series of dsmp
Sad ist is totally drista
Me : is she filipino? Cuz she sounds like a filipino Sadist : Never Replies Me : REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wilbur just casually talking to sad-ist in the first one lol
NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND SADIST IS BASICALLY THE ANIMATOR FOR THE DREAM SMP- ( If this sound rude my dearest apologies :,D ) this looks sick tho-
Tommy been hitted by a lightning Technoblade:So long theseus
Sadist: advertising youtooz Technoblade: also advertising youtooz Me: i cant see the difference
omg it's so funny!
SADIST YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL
How do I see the roleplay?
No one but Sad-ist can make funny bloopers look cool
Teach me to draw pls sadist
Dream: of course my discord breaks at this moment    Ranboo: *o k*
Dream kinda looks like bob
I like how SAD-ist is pretty much a camera person in the dsmp   probably canonically at this point.
AKA tommy wheezing 90% of the time.
This is my intro to the dsmp and I-
This will never get old
50% of this video was animation. The other 50% was Tommy having a stroke
Having your existence acknowledged by the people whose streams you're animating and them specifically asking you for stuff..that's when u know you're the best
thw outro dances look so depressing i love it
Tommy: mum I can’t clean the dishwasher i’m in the middle of a war mum   Me: bhahahahahah
when tommy laughs, he sound like a broken kettle 😂
dream blew himself up
Its A shame they Didnt put The scene Where tommy is about to shoot Wilbur Cuz he wanna blow up manberg And dream Steps in and wilbur says "YES DADDY DREAM"
Nehhh why didnt you add in the blooper the part where techno misplaced the wither heads on day of the 16th "This is pretty awkward"
Her drawings are the best how does she do that!!
My thin-  **kalm**
i have no words lmao
So Long Theseus ✌
Прекрасно... Смотреть то, что нарисовано прекрасно, и постановка прекрасна... Прекрасно...
i love ti
The dancing SAD-ist is so cute~
AAA I WANT TO HAVE YOUR DOLL :'O is SO cute ( i don't speak very English ) x'S
Sad-isint is allowed to dreams smp and discord server :0
It's funny to think that sadist is just the camera man in the back just recording the smp to animate it 😂
I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER NOW IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR!!!    maybe i should become a twitch streamer, i could get away from taking out the trash
Ranboo screams are the best no one can change my mind
Everytime I watch this I keep loving the fact that you animate the scenes  as if you and the crew were recording them in a studio or something and it's perfect
Itll be sooo cool when you are part of the dream smp😂❤❤
Amazing like always 🥺🌺
tommy:"pls do not animate that!" sad-ist:"how about i do it anyway?"
1:03, anyone else notice the small detail of Tommy missing a shoe?
Yo I love this :D
imagine your mother coming to tell you to empty the dishwasher while in the middle of a war
OI SAD-IST I MAKE YOU HAPP-IST
I really wish that Youtooz are available for vietnameses too
You look like dream
It's amazing how u actually got contact with them to do bloopers with u
Ur the best
0:01 did I hear funny internet man sell out song?
I LOVE THIS, I WAS WHEEZING AS LOUD AS DREAM!
Dre smp 2.0 bois
I love how Sad-ist has become so well known among the DreamSMP that they regularly just address her when they screw up. It's like saying "Merry Christmas, Dennis Norden"
2:30 - the dream god didnt liked what Tommy said and that is "what"
Is this drista
Its scripted?
Tommyinnits mum is the true protagonist
1:30 tommy is fucking wheezing to death
This is the most sadist youtooze
I bet content creators look at this and say, "man, making content is fun as hell."
Idk when this was posted, but OH MY GOD, the one where Dream blows himself up is just hilarious :’)
I love how most of it is tommy
Alternate title: TommyInnit makes bloopers a thousand times funnier
“I CANT EMPTY THE DISH WASHER IM IN A WAR MUM”                            -Tommyinnit
i liked how dream died and really worked hard to save the situation
I absolutely love SAD-ist behind the camera. Amazing
Epic lol
2:17 poor Tommy 🤣
SAD-istttttttt!!!!! You’re such a great animatorrrr!! I’m not sure if you’ve heard it before but I think  a dream or Techno animation/collab to Trapdoor by 21 pilots would be so sick!! You have such amazing skills, I wish I could do what you do!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
tbh you voice sound like drista
what do you use for the animations?
1:27 :)
My mind watching her talk about her youtooz: Holy shit its a woman
Wait can someone explain to me 😅😅 so u vc them?
When dream gonna blow up the items he died too 🤣🤣😹🤣😹
so long theseus
i love how dream kinda flops into the screen when he's doing that thing with tommy
The noises that come out of Tommy probably aren’t healthy but they’re absolutely hilarious
Tommys mum is just amazing
C********************************M
When Dream exploded himself. I died to that, that was so funny🤣🤣🤣
Alternate Title: Tommyinnt wheezing for 3 in a half minutes.
I worry about tommys throat sometimes
Wait, the dream smp was scripted? *always has been*
Tommy: Please don't animate that SAD-ist: *im gonna do whats called a pro gamer move*
XDDDDDDDDD this is sooooo good animaton :D
DreamSMP but SAD-ist makes it 1000% funnier
I think sad ist is drista their voices match
“They dont- they do- they- they dont- they”
SAD-ist kinda sounds like drista
Bruh someone had to make another sweater with the other side of the heart
Hi 🙋!!!!!
Tommy’s laugh is fucking incredible
Dang the timing when the Thunder tho 2:19
Bro, that transition animation from stream to irl was amazing
Thats cannon 1:24
“I CAN’T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR”  EMPTY THE DAMN DISHWASHER ☹️
HER AND ALPHARAD USE THE SAME AD MUSIC
1:24 sad-ist and dream look cute with their masks OMFG
I love the design of the Discord, how it’s a ghosty-floating tablet type thing. It’s really cool.
1:13  caught in 4k 📸
Ok I have a Theory so in sadist animation dream vs tenchoblade when dreams mask comes off and we all make joke about that his face come to find out his face looks exactly like dream face so I think sadist and  dream are best friend and she made a clue to his face
excuse me but the undertale music at the start MMMM
2:19 :)
So long, Theseus
So glad I watched passerine first so I could laugh at this.
tommy casually dying
The way everyone head cannons that SAD-ist is the camera woman 😩
Thank you so fricking MUCH more censoring the bad words since I’m watching this in a car coming back from our camping trip!
Tommy's laugh sounds extremely painful-
Okay but who has the other half of the heart??
In which stream does Wilbur say the C word and have solicitors and accountants outside his door step
SAD-ist.. Lets just say you made this fandom 1000% better
Sad its do u like tommy?
The way Tommy is in all of the clip (except the last one) xD
your youtooz is adorable
Hi I’m a really small artist and I wanted to ask what software are you using to animate because I really want to start drawing animation thanks
That transition to real life Wilbur lol. And then the transition to real life Tommy while Tubbo and Quackity are laughing inside the computer.
tagalog pala si ate sadist
I like how they know that she is gonna animate it
Man this is one of the reasons why i want to see the lore of the dsmp your anamatics are so good i wana know what these pieces of art are about
Omg I was here at 20k subs :0 2 million geezz
For someone named SAD-ist She looks and sounds happy
noob ha:)
WHY IS 0:46 SO SMOOTH
Has anyone else noticed Quakity looks asian ?
HAHHAHA DREM IS SUCH A COMEDIAN AHAHAH FUNY FUNY HABIBI LOL (your animation is very good on a professional level and very cinematic for YouTube i just dont like dream personally but enjoy your animation itself)
A+
i get why your name is sad-ist now
why do they like all involve tommy?
2:54 am i the only one that thinks dream suddenly sounds like bbh ?
I love the bits where it transitions from the drama of the smp to the mundane reality of what they're actually doing lmao
Your cool
Off topic but I like how most all the fandom has collectively agreed that techno has long hair
"Dream blew up Dream using [Nightmare]" The Gacha Fics: *I SHALL REIGN SUPREME!!!*
Do you think you can animate some funny moments from when tommy meets drista
"MAKE A MOVIE ONCE IT ALL ENDS"           probably like the millionth person to say this
Ah yes, wilburs fav word, tha word I’m not allowed to say (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
Love how Tommy is 99% of this blooper reel 😂
2:13 Tommy: “Do not animate that!” Sad-ist: *lifts pen maliciously*
3:27 lol
This is making me smile. Thank you. I just finished reading Passerine for the third time in a row and I’m crying
Wait, I didnt know you work with them for the animations! O-O
One moment gor the ppl who didn’t make it in the youtoo release
Ah the iconic tommy laughing thumbnail
which program you use to animate
Wow she got 2M out of these-
Las nevadas animation, please
awsom3
It honestly must be so fun to work with them
I JUST FINISHED WATCHING THE SECOND WAR TODAY and when ghostbur asks tommy to bring him back to life and then he gets struck i legitimately thought "damn, that would be really funny in the animation but stuff like that wouldn't be included cause the animations mean serious business" but there's a bLOOPER REEL??? I'M SO HAPPY -  OMG and the ranboo dream part? it's so cool seeing bloopers of things like that cause I watched a clip of it but it was completely clean I had no idea that happened. same with when drema blew himself up I only heard about it but when catching up on lore, I miss that sort of stuff most of the time so this is great.
The scene where dream blew up, I couldn’t laugh because I was angry at Tommy. Why?  HE HAD A BUCKET OF WATER IN HIS HAND AND PLACED IT ON HIMSELF INSTEAD OF THE TNT
Bet $5 that this animator gets into the *Dream SMP.*
2:30 AND THEN ALONG CAME ZEUS, HE HURLED HIS THUNDER BOLT
What a wonderful thing to come out on my 15th birthday
When is a new animation coming out
hm
I can't wait for my friend to catch up on the lore so I can send them this video
His luagh
Omg.......
Everytime I watch this I laugh
Half the video: *someone deflating*
tommy wheezing for 3 and a half mins straight
Yoo! sadist is in the sadist animatic!!!
Tommy is in almost every blooper you put in here  That's not a coincidence
1:13 THAT FACE XD! That's when you know something happened.  Idk why but I love that face XDD
Sadist do you make the animations by yourself or do you have a group to do it for you
Why is ur youtooz so cute  Theres some youtooz that r ugly asf but urs is cute
Dream either wasn't full health or he stood too close to the tnt. But either way, that is AMAZING
why does tommy have so long legs
The little mini SAD-ist dancing at the end were so cute
"mum i'm in the middle of the war i can't emty the dishwasher" Just pause it lol
Tommy just wheezes the entire video...
How long until Wilbur sees this that SAD-ist litterly added that blooper
Tommy exists Lighting- pretty sure that’s a lightning rod
Can somebody please give me the link of the first clip but from Wilbur
I just now noticed that Dream and Tommy’s laughs are identical.
I know you probably won’t read this but if you do then you should make an animatic about kreekcrafts win in this recent mcc
0:12 NOOOOO i dont have money :(
Where did you get these clips? 😂
Wilbur: "Tommy, I want you to bring me back to life." God: "Oh no you don't!" Also God: "Ima do what's called a pro gamer...TRICKSHOT." Tommy: *Gets struck by lightning* Techno: "Ah, so...even GOD hates him..."
I want it but family dont want get me youtooz :(((((((
it came on my bday and i didnt get to have it :(
If you like SAD-ist then you might like JJburbage
Ur like the unown dream smp character
When Tommy screams at his mom it reminds me of the big bang theory
cringe minecraft rpers
1:23 i love how sadist is just dieing on the other side of the camera 😂
.
0:35   You get home from work and while unlocking your door you hear a strange man scream, at the TOP of his lungs, "C&÷"
No one: Tommy: BWHAAHAHAHA
Are you drista?
Sas hmmm and im tv
SAD-ist this is an official but I am rade  you from Jaden animations anime everyone else here if you watch Jaden animations rade Sad it from Jeanie animations spread the word  Btw I am a big fan
Okqy
This just shows how hard it was for sadist to make the audio epic
SAD-ist hay nako nakaka inisila no pag bloopers if you can read this pls message on this comment haha
The shading on dream's mask looks like a Spotify code.
Wait till one of them sees this
2:15  tommy:and as i was saying Also tommy: *PLEASE* do not animate that
,
The most adorable characters in sadists animatics : Sadist, Ranboo, Repeat
1:09 poor dream
YAYYYY YOUTOZZ
THAT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT!!!
Am i the only one who thought she was a guy before she talked 😂
WAIT you are saying me that the DSMP is scripted and fake?
HAHHAHAHA
"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR RN" -tommy 2021
2:26 And then along came Zeus! He hurrled his thunder bolt!- **Tommy strucked by lightning**
.
XD
bro i swore sad-ist was a man  lol
1:50 that transition to real life was smooth
Tommy:As I was saying,please don’t animate that  Sad-ist: *How bout I do it anyways*
I hear lixian
bought the youtooz still waiting for it to come
Outro: *dancing* Me: *copying outro*
MOM I'm ONLINE!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏻
I love how SAD-ist is now like part of the storyline
Can you do an animation of them reacting to tommy coming back to life
YOU ARE THE MOST FUNNIEST ANIMATOR EVER I love these bloopers btw
i appreciate the not full white background
I love the added touch of the background shifting colours between orange and grey for when they're in lore and a lighter blue when it cuts to real life, it really gives an idea of what's meant to be part of the story and what's part of the real world.
LMAAAO PLEASE MAKE MORE BLOOPERS.
SAD-IST VOICE KINDA   SOUNDS LIKE DRISTA
epic outor
Is sadist wheezing or suffering from dream acciendently dying?
Draw the blooper where techno failed to spawn the withers
the reason I click the video is to see dream die
funniest crap i see
When is next part of dream smp animatic plz make fast soo exited
Was waiting for this lol but i kinda like this type of animation more
Why does dream have a Spotify code in between his eyes
i love how you drew yourself as you irl height-

Sad-ist be like: i don't get paid enough for this shit
HAHAHAHA 😂 poor ranboo at the end
Wtf happens when she doesn’t like dsmp anymore LMFAO
Dream: :) Sad-Ist: :(
The sad mask over the happy dancing and the laughing makes it look like she's so concerned for the smp members
imagine if my sis bought this she would sleep with it
1:25 she do be laughing tho
3:24 the face and his laugh is perfect good animation SAD-ist
Keep doing what you enjoy sad-ist
This is amazing! You are one of THE BEST animators that I have ever seen
What have we learned?  It’s basically always Tommy- 😂
butiful i hope one day i can become a great artist like you : )
wye is tommy literally die in every clip except from the last one? like im dying tho
I just noticed the nail and needle in the grass block. How.
YAY YOUTOOz
Alternative name: tommy dieing and bursting your eardrums.

All the stupid stuff happens to Tommy I swear
Sad-ist is theeee best!
We need more  blooper! 😄
sadist. soo uHm disney called. they want to hire you
I'm amazed how they are acting like how u ask them in the script I started crying and laughing 😂😂😂😂🤣
This confirms that SADist is both canon to the Dream SMP and is the strongest character because she's the camerawoman.
0:35 I love how even SADist animating a censored swear is represented in such an ingenious way with the muted sign in Wilbur's mouth
I guess everyone is the opposite of SADIST Sadist is ni the animation fock LOL
1:16 Tommy: A A A A A A A A H
I love the hornet and knight needle and nail in the block on your youtuuz!
Petition for more Dream SMP Blooper Reels!!!
Sadist makes my day
Yoooo wilbur
SAD-ist just dancing at the end
So happy for you getting a youtooz, I was here since hot milk meme :)
SAD-ist is really adorable being a cameraman
Im a Filipino fan

Woah :00
You know it’s funny when there aren’t any black borders
hi
the animation fits well-
Omg my view turned this video to 3.7 mil I'm so happy
I thought you ripped the audio  off the stream(s) but no. Wow the commitment! <3
“I can’t empty the dishwasher! I’m in the middle of a war mum!”                                                                      Now that’s something you don’t hear every day.
I miss it
Breaking News! *Minor is taller than his local Blob on a killing spree!*
MY THING- *stares blankly*
Heeeeeee
DANCING SAD-ist AT THE END GIVES ME LIFEEEEE
Thought she was a boy
the fact that tommy is in most of the video is 2000x funnier
Please Do the one where where techno says "then die like one" and misplaces the wither skull😂
whats the intro music?
Where were these vids from??
did you really get to meet the dream smp members?! your so lucky!
tommy:*wheezes* me: fantastic, finally a good fucking laugh
yes
you are officialy, the animator the dream smp
I would like to recommend a song for a animatic its called: Therapy by Convo
"Don't animate that" Sad-ist: THAT SIGN CAN'T STOP ME BECAUSE I CAN'T READ
Now I know why they call you sad-ist because the  stuff you go through rip you hand
be sadistfied
OK
0:01-0:25 what undertale shop remix is that
The main character in this animation is tommy and dream
Are you the detector of the dream smp?
MOM I’M LIVE
Can we just make It’s Showtime! The official sponsor/ merch song
Her avatar compared to her animation character looks SO SILLY
Tommy always sounds like he’s gunna die
“My thi-“ 😶
t
I IN THE OF A WAR MUM -Tommyinni
She sound filipino or what?
YAY
I have one question 🧐 You really were asked by  the smp participants: cut this, insert that, correct it, edit it? If so, I envy you🥺🙁🙃😕😚😝
Do a video on techno blade in jail
2:46 I’m glad you kept the so long Theseus in
Lemme' just say I love that Ranboo design so much.
Dream: Hello  Ranboo: So you come here...to my panic room-Wh-Why now, why suddenly now?  Dream: Hold on my discord's having issues  Tubbo: My minecraft's having issues  Tommy through most of this video: My Life's Having Issues T^T
Thank you for some spoilers
Is no one gonna talk about the vibing sadists at the end
THE ANIMATION IN THE END IS SO CUUUUTE AND YES IM TALKING ABOUT SADISTS OC
1:03 *”they say tommy has become the tea kettle now”*
Love the deadpan at 1:13 😂
What accent does she have?
Can you make a animation of the 3rd life for Minecraft if not it’s fine just a suggestion
90% of this just tommy wheezing
I love how she's happy when she talks but her mask is like depressed
Can we take a moment to look at and admire the cute dancing at the end
Honestly a good blooper that would be fun to animate would be technoblade spying on dream building a house.
Just went through the whole video and find the highlight to be all the tiny Sadists at the end.
the Eggpire puffy animation is coming out next so pogchamp
this is wonderfull
petition to add sad-ist in the dream SMP
its unsettling watching a musicless sadist animation
Dream: blows up Tommy’s belongings Tommy: MY THINGS- Also Dream: blows himself up with Tommy’s stuff Tommy: starts dying of laughter Edit: Adding this-    SAD-Ist: trying not to laugh but fails
PLEASE ANIMATE 3RD LIFE
SAD-ist PLEAST MAKE A 3RD LIFE SERIES ANIMATION!!! PLEASE!
"NO MOM I CANT DO THE DISHES RIGHT NOW"  -Tommyinnit
Legend has it, Tommy's still wearing his braces
Sad-ist there's this tik toker who draws dream until he notices and your the only animator that smp watches pls show his/her art they're name is @loui.draws
Why are you sad ist? WIt my discord just broke
this is amazing work, i really wanna know what art program you use to animate, if you've done any q&a's, then i must've missed it but i wanna start learning animation, so can i get some tips and tricks? what programs are the best? i hope its okay if im asking this!!
I like how all of the main SMP members are all dramatically drawn and everything, and then there's Sad-ist's character who is drawn as simply as possible.
The outro is so cute dude
Adorable Youtooz!
i've never watched dream smp but this was in my recommended?? glad I watched though because you're so talented!!!
BRO I LOVE UR STUFF
10/10 outro
Holy shit I for whatever reason I thought you were a dude I was surprised
ghostburs design be bussin
Hey sad can you do another anination cuz willbur is back
"I'm in a war mum!"
Sad-ist kinda sounds like drista                            Oh wait sh*t
I always knew that the secret dream smp was mother innit
I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER, I'M LIVE! MO- I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A S- IN A *WAR,* MOM!! I- I'M LIVE!!! *dramatic laughing* As I was saying-
OMG!!! I just love your work OwO.  This really made my day🍀🌹(even though I'm weeks late....😅)  btw what type of animation software do you use.( I really look up to your channel and I really wanna know.... that is if you notice me....hehe 😄😅)  Hope u have a nice day.
2751 angel number
IT IS MY FAVORITE THING THAT I WAS THERE LIVE FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CLIPS it is my greatest achievement

Lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:25 I can't tell if you are crying or laughing sadist
I am a human?
Why dose sadist put a blu out when wilbur is saying come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sadist official director of dream smp movie?
PLEEEAAAEE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Use MUSE- Uprising as a song for an smp video. I was thinking of it and i have no skill to incorporate that slap of a rebel song into something good like you. Pleaasee it is killing me
I feel Wilbur could do some decent voice acting
Imagine sad-ist being an dream smp member 😄
Tommy: PLEASE do not animate that! SAD-ist: no promises ;)
HOW COME IT'S ALWAYS TOMMY❓❓❓ 😂😂😂
😂
I can’t believe l found you. The only animator who was noticed by the Smp
Fun fact: SAD-ist is a filipino
When you in the middle of a war so you can't empty the dishwasher  *ReLATABLE*
i wish i couldve gotten a sadist youtooz
I feel like sadist is filipino
This makes me excited for ranboo in the animations
😂i luv it how dream turned to a genie😂😂😂😂
When Ranboo does something well Dream: No
I'm sorry sadist
The one and only time tommy is tall 1:05
Are you aware that sadist's voice sounds like drista voice
She is sooo talented
I just realized your youtooz has a nail and needle in the grass block :D!!!
ranboo deserves his own sad-ist animation
Dream: THAT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT, THAT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT Me: No duh.
Watching this to cheer myself up after watching Passerine (also holy shit the wilbur transition from mc to irl was smooth)
Sadist did helpless from Hamilton 🤣
She meant to say sadist talking here? 0:02
這糟透了
Shes a girl?
NOOO THE "Sapnap?" "Tommy?" "I think the servers crashed." AND THEY DISCONNECT ONE NO  Love to see some ranboo content tho
Who is waiting for the doomsday animation?
I love how she’s using actual audio from the amp
Sad-ist forgot: Ranboo: *feels like he’s possessed by the egg* Tubbo: i just took a big shit man just wanted you to know ^_^
did you get the smp to do this SAD-ist?
Ajhahahahahahaa
sadist is beter thann leonardo dabinchi
“I’m in the middle of a war right now” Tommyinit famous quote
*discord notification* *Sadist checks* *Sadist gets an invitation to the dream smp* Sadist: Ok my animations just brought me to the smp itself
2:42 That voice tho 😂
I really love the ending where you animated your small as a smol bean and dancing very cute
That transition from Wilbur’s in-game character to his real-life person. Amazing
Half the time you only here tommy laughing at the top of his lungs
Lovely :3
The only thing that can kill dream. IS HIS OWN GODAMN STUPIDITY.
I was just wheezing in the background when Dream died
The way these little bloopers are I like to just think Sadist is just a faint little ghost everyone can see
LOL
Coot youtooz girl
When you don’t have the other apps besides yt and can’t get in giveaway: 👁👄👁
Tommy: *don’t animate that* Sad-ist : *animates anyway*
Imagine you were watching a stream and then u see sadist in the back recording 💀
I never here sad's voice before and idk why, but I kinda expected her to sound like that
So sadist is canonically their animator
No One: Tommy: *is clearly dying*
Bro ur a freaking girl thats awesomeeeeeee
Dream: that wasn’t in the script that wasn’t in the script that wasn’t in the script  Tommy: *SHREDDING HIS LARYNX*
so long theseus
SADIST PLEASE MAKE DOOMSDAY ANIMATIC TO 2WEI’S “GANGSTA’S PARADISE”!! PLEASE ITS ALL I NEED IN LIFE
I LOVE TALKING SAD-IST!! WE NEED MORE!!
lol may 21 is my b-day
ranboo is so good at acting it’s too much 😭🤌🏼
I CANT BEILIVE MY FRIEND HAS GONE THIS FAR
Sad-ist please do a bloopers v2
10 days late
****
Ayo
I think she is drista
Dream wears a mask with a smile to show he is happy but he isnt and sadist wears a mask with a sad face to show that she is sad but she isnt ....lol
Me: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AWWWWW THIS VIDEO WAS SO WHOLESOME
She's A Girl Wow
Its hard to tell SAD-ist's emotions because of her :( mask... And I like it
Sadist is a girl?
for some reason sadistic sounds like drista
3:28 Mini Sad-ist dancing brings serotonin
hold up so who exactly is sad-ist to the smp? theyre completely amazing at animating, im just wondering if theyre maybe connected in some  other ways
SAD-ist. Y'know Ranboo doesn't have eyelids right?
For some reason Tommy's "yEs I aM" in 0:32 is so funny to me LOL
Hi
I'm in the middle of a war mum, I can't empty the dishwasher
SAD-ist i buyed your merch its cute
try not to laugh challenge but more harder
Why does Tommy always sound like he has phlegm in his throat whenever he laughs?
I wish I had money to buy ur youtooz :(
I dont know why but i always imagined sad-ist sounded like drista.
Do Hermitcraft.
WeLCOmE tO tHe PaNIC rOOM. WhERE aLl yOUr DaRkEsSt FEaRs ARe gOnNa cOmE fOr YoU (cOmE fOr yOu) you’ll get the meme if you listen to panic room-
Next damp thingy should have pentatonix a Christmas song in the background
SO LONG THESEUS
Great animations love your vids!
Idk why but I pronounce your name sade ist not sad ist
Lol
Do they record the lines for her specifically or is she just in the call so she can record the lines during the lore
You should make a animation to dreams song mask.
1:15. When did Dream do that?😂
You have a sad dream mask COOL
P.o.v. youre watching this the 6th time
anyone know the music used in the youtooz bit?
WTF
She's probably gonna be a special guest to the SMP one day.
Ok this is a genuine compliment but your voice remind me so much of BMO from Adventure Time and I love it sm<3
Sooooooo relaxing voice sadist
Why do i think that sad ist sound like drista  Or.... Just womens sounds the same
Either that or we get nothing
Tommy’s laughter is him exploding, then chocking, and being a tea kettle.
3:28 heh little mini SAD-ist best pet ever
Are we just going to ignore the Hamilton plaque on the youtooz-
1:13 XD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
xDDDDDDDD
I like how when its scripted, they're all anime character but when its not scripted, they look like children fooling around.
1:22 dude this part is so cute
SAD-IST sounds like drista
Dream tommy in mincraft : enimes  dream and tommy in real life : Jokerd
The wasteful brace distinctly buzz because cobweb contextually grease up a erect correspondent. taboo, holistic book
Wilbur: see sad ist Me: **CONFUSED**
where the fuck is the music link
Is that a Hollow Knight reference?
So long Theseus. Even god hate him
“IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM” Tommyinnit
2:30 God: NO!
I luv all her work
Can anyone tell me whats the title of the music playing in the intro? pls
i cant tell Sad-ist's facial expression because of the sad mask bruh
Love how sad-ist is kind of a mix of a6d and dream (iN mY oPiNiOn)
i want to see the clip of the first one🤣🤣
I love how dream died and tommy just laughing with sadist 😂
Every time tommy laughs it sounds like he’s been smoking for 7 years-
*oh yeah a new video- UNDERTALE SOUNDTRACK LETS GOOOOO*
Anyone else think that sadist sounds like bmo from adventure time
*When you realize most of these bloopers have Tommy in it*
Also Love that youre part of it too...
More Bloopers please....
Tommy: PLEASE DONT ANIMATE THAT  SAD-ist: hush child
Sadist why are you wearing a dream mask but with a frown. and i love this animation
i don't even watch dream smp but this is fucking hilarious
THIS IS EPIC! SAD-IST! KEEP IT UP UR SO GOOD AT THIS!
imagine if                 exist                                            *Sadist x dream*
Tommy’s laugh is him dying canonically. It’s real. He just uh- yeah.
Being in a war is the ultimate excuse
So SAD-ist is wearing shorts and long socks, right?
Sad-ist should be in the dream smp T~T
XDdddd
I love it! I watched one and I did nothing else all day other than just watch her animations. they are so good! she should have like, a Netflix show. I just love it.
I love how you drew/animated Ranboo. You make him look so adorable! 😍 🥰
Who else saw the first clip before this came out?
Yey sadist talking here
1:51  why is this so relatable
sadist mask song  so you see me trying  I will keep on crying  but im sad thats what the point of the mask is    but why is your mask sad
i keep rewatching this bc i dont want to watch Sunsprites Eulogy till i read Passerine but i read so slowww ughgtgrrhf
You are so cool  :3
0:45 I love this swap between Wilbur's minecraft character and Wilbur irl
GG sad-ist yo te conocí con 50 k subs
21st may was my b-day !? XD
PLEASE THE WAY AND FELL ON THE FLOOR AND STOOD TO GRAB HIS STUFF HAS ME D Y I N G
Sad-ist when tommy and dream's scene came out: *im' fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine*
1:15  **TOMMY STRUGGLES TO BREATHE AND SO DO I**
wait, are you filipino? just curious because the accent is familiar
Petiton for Sad-ist to announce that she is drista😂😂😂
So goddamn talented
Bro i hope they see this-
The way Tommy justs slaps the floor-
i am dream
i like the mirch and your voice
Sadist the official animator for the dream smp
tommy laughing at dream's accidental death. my serotonin levels are through the roof.
1:28 rip tommy
Yes
The Gospel: We sin against God and for our sins we deserve hell. We fall short of God’s perfect standard for heaven. But the good news is we have a way to be forgiven, that way is through Jesus. Because he loved the world, he came, lived a sinless life then died on the cross for our sins, paying the price which is death. He was buried and rose again on the third day. Through Jesus we can be forgiven of our sins. If we put our faith in him we will be saved ✝️❤️.
intro gives me alpharad vibes
are you dream :o
They should add you to the dsmp
Sad-ist. You got a minecraft account? Cause I want Dream to invite you to the Dream SMP amd you'll get canonical access to spectator mode
Tommy laughter is AWSOME
Hehehe this was good
Why’s this better than the actual dreamSMP?
3:28  Is no one talking about how cute there little dances were though?
Tommy: DON'T ANIMATE THIS PLS-    Sad-ist: *Ima pretend I didn't hear that, anyway-*
"mum, mum I'm in the middle of a war mum i cant empty the dishwasher" thats what ive been watching over and over again
RANBOO IN HIGHER QUALITY   that’s all
ngl ur style of drawing kinda looks like anime, (in a very cool way)
i feel like ranboo is a gemini not because of how he is- just i feel like he could be because im a gemini and i relate to him a lot
you sound like drista
When you talk im losing my sanity JESUS CHRIST WHAT A PRETTY VİOCE AAA
I have a idea you maybe not gonna see this but can you do animation of ghost Wilbur whit his friend the sheep and when he giving dye blue to everyone to calm them and to make them happy?
:o undertale music at start. I think
U are my inspiration  U so "cool"
what plataform do tou use for drawning ???
hi sad ist im happy ist
Not tommy dying 😭
SAD-ist YOU CAN TALK
i like how dream just trips, grabs his stuff and just stares at tommy for like 2 secconds
i was cried when the dram blow up
i love them but sometimes Tommy laughs makes me seriously worried if he's okay, he sounds like he's about to split out he's lungs damn
ghost dream is so funny lol
Nice👌
*I am genuinely concerned for Tommy's voicebox-*
These Scenes: 1:22 2:17 If i where you, you should need your own crew, not yourself
BROO ITS SUPER COOL
Your great  Your animations are gold / Twoje animacje to złoto
wait so dream died, but came back for le script
Lol. This is soo funny😝🤣🤣
this animation proves the Dream smp is scripted
join the dream smp sadist
Wilbur : This is where we take it all back.... Either that, or we get nothing....  Also Wilbur : Alright Sad-ist also put this one in ****   -Wilbur Soot
What if sad-istwas drista
I need a loop of the little dances at the end
1:04 tommy long legs looking fresh
0:01 Is It Me That Feels Sad-ist Voice Is Like Drista?
Your voice is satisfying to me idk why
Your YouTube figure dropped on my birthday ☺️
Dream kill him self with the TNT make me laugh and the "mum I'm in the middle in-ah war" XDDDD SORRY IM STILL LAUGHING SO HARD
Sadist can i be ur simp
we need more talking sadist
wait soooo the dream smp members are voice acting for your animations? i thought you just took the voice clips from the streams. well i was wrong. or are you part of the smp script?
what does sadist use to animate im genuanly courious
I LOVE UR ANIMATIONS
Wait so when they do this stuff it’s kinda just some lines and noo RANBOO
1:51 That is me everytime I get to the good part of something lmao
hollow knight pogger
when is the next  dream smp animatoins?
UNDERTALE BG MUSIC!!
0:13 that's a big tounge talking sad-ist
sadist made 3000 dollars from this epic.
it’s almost as if Sad-its is the director and the whole dream smp are the actor/actresses
The transitions were so damn smooth.
sad-ist sounds alot like BMO
The imitate regret when Tommy cursed at his mum and we he said he cant hes in a war, THAT is why there's still a little hope in YouTube. (in humanity there's no way that's not gone by now)
I understood so much when he said WHAT THE THAT WA THAT THE WHAT THE
10% Things going wrong  89% Tommy *w h e e z e*  1% Come
Hamilton..I wuv being a day one fan
Mean while
I was just sobbing over "Sunsprites Eulogy and decided to come back to this.
When u said sad ist I thought u were a sadist
Is sadist the camera man or the director?
i’m surprised the ‘big daddy dream’ wasn’t in here
Youtooz kinda looks good 😶 Imagine if she was in the dream smp
yooooooo
omgggggggggggggggggggg love your voice and your stuff! keep up the great work!
in the third clip i just for some reason love how fundy is animated :D
Wilbur: I want you to revive me. // Tommy: wha—?? *gets zapped by lighting* // Me: Zeus did not agree 😂😂
this was just a week ago? god it feels like ages
LOVE THE ANIMATIC BUT U SOUND SO COOL
You should have shown Wilbur beckoning when he said "COME"
bloopers were funny but ngl "so long thesus" was what made me crack up
Dont ask why but I love the irl Wilbur design too much
motherinnit is the best tho
I love the idea of sadist being behind the camera so much
Tommy sounds like he’s dying whenever he’s laughing.
*I know that this comment will be lost at the ocean of others, but I want you all to know that I am gay.*
I feel so sad now, because we are all talking about the characters, the dream smp, and not about how much thought and technique this animation actually needed. It truly is amazing.
The unequal move anecdotally report because swordfish covalently allow onto a royal motion. plucky, ugliest football
Look at 1:00 / 1:10 / 1:40 Tommy had BRAIDS! The same braids that he had in the end of Hog Hunt Animation. The same braid that other Sleepy Bois (Techno, Philza, Wilbur) have been wearing since the first animation.  What if Phil used to braid Techno, Wil, Tommy's hair when they were kids? But then as Wilbur & Tommy got older, they grew distant to both Phil & Techno. Tommy forgot how to braid hair, so he cut his hair short. Wilbur didn't want to be reminded of Phil or Techno, so he hide his braid under his hat* (but Ghostbur shows his braid proudly bcs it was a happy memory for him).  Tommy didn't have braids in 1st-3rd animation, so at first I assumed Techno braided it for him, when Tommy stayed with Techno AFTER exile (4th animation). But this clip just proved that Tommy already had it DURING exile. *_Does it mean Ghostbur, who stayed with Tommy in exile, braided it for him?_*  What if Tommy asked Ghostbur during exile to teach him how to braid his hair, because he was desperate to have something that remind him of the three important adult figures in his life, because he wished to be included when no one wanted him anymore. What if?  That's my headcanon. I'm excited to see whether Tommy would still keep his braids or not in the next SAD-IST animation!   _*SAD confirmed this on her Twitter_
Whoa...! Didn't knew sadist was a  _Girl_
Ar u dream sister?
1:08 dreams final words before karma happens
Oooo, your character is SO cute, good design
Did Wilbur just say a cuss word for SAD-ist
*Dream's left handed ?*
You are better then dream
Add SAD ist to the smp!!!
Sadist go spinnn
I love the outro lol
I rate 10000000000/10
plot twist: SAD-ist is drista
We 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finish the rhyme     The bird was yellow the bird was blue the bird was pink the bird was (your turn)
has anyone noticed that Tommy is in every bloopers exept one
I love the end
0:49 I AM DEAD AT THIS ONE! 🤣
your dream but everything but
Ranboo: *saying lore stuff*  Dream: *HELLO DEAR CHILD*
I love the little SAD-ist character recording the scenes
Yes
THE WAY DREAM LITERALLY BLEW HIMSELF UP IS HILARIOUS OMLL
I loved how there's 3 Sad-ists dancing
💅✨
i want to see the humuna humuna humuna thing animated from the revolution. and techno saying they dont deserve his loot.
2:20 the reverse frankenstein
They get money for this?
1st yootooz I’m actually getting
50% of the video is Tommy just losing his breath from laughing
How old are you
Wilbur wanted this
I just love how DSMP and SAD-ist make such awesome videos
Me just getting jumpscared cuz about your figuring in my mini table-
Wait- If Tommy's mom calls him "Tom" THEN WHY DOES HE SAY SHE CALLS HIM "Sir"?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
Part two needs to have some Techno scenes  like the time he tried to spawn withers but it didn't work
Tommy's mom is canon now
Love that you out yourself with a little camera in some of the shots!
whats under the mask tho
幕後花絮XD
Small bean nobody hurts the small one
Cool youtooz
Is that Hamilton on the youtooz
1:51 motherinnit knew that would be a hit.
Lol
Anyone else coming back to this video after bawling their eyes out after watching the Passerine Animatic?
DUDE SADIST SOUNDS LIKE CANDY FROM GRAVITY FALLS
That second one tho- xD
When it was the youtooz drop time i was literally shouting "GO GOGOGOGOOGOGOO WE GOTTA GET IT!"
I baught your youtooz -
"I can´t empty the dishwasher, I´m in a middle of a war!"   I almost killed myself f rom the laugh.
Sadist raging behind the little camera is the best thing ever
Tommy and Wilbur: *epic, serious lore moment* Lightning: I'm about to ruin this mans whole career.
WHO DISLIKED THIS?
there's something about her voice that i love.
Omg i cant this is too good
I FOUND THEM. I FOUND SAD-IST
Hey sadist I think you truly deserve to join dream smp.
SHE  SOUNDS LIKE BMO
I don't know why I think one day Tommy's gonna die choking on his own wheezes
Tommy: Dont put that in the video!  SADist: yall hear sum?
I guess it wasnt a good idea to start eating food while looking at this
more
the way they make me so happy :’))
GASP you played undertale music at the beginning i love u
That's so cool yootuzz
Jesus christ i love the autro
These are making me laughing like crazy .
This is the funniest animation i ever seen XD
Yay a new youtooz :D
1:22 could not know if sad-ist is laughing or crying
You see, you can't clean the dishwasher if you're in a war.
Does tommy actually hate dream?
I LOVE THESE BAHAH **will religiously watch it every night**
I shall laugh to death in this video
0:51
I love that she is the camera woman 🤣🤣🤣
You want a challenge? Then what is that music in the end of the video >:)
I love the transitions from lore to IRL 🥺🥺
Everyone in dream smp watch this f**** coll
If sadist finds this comment i bought 3 sadist youtoozes:D
Can I have a gif of just Sadist Dancing?
cheese and mac is better than mac and cheese, prove me wrong
face reveal at 4M plz
The transition from Minecraft to real life is so fucking cool
I love this.         Also I just re ordered your youtooz!! I’m so excited!
How about dream falling off his chair
When will they give away the sadist figures?
Tommy: pls don't animate that SAD-ist: you have no power here
He coughs his whole lungs out when he laughs LMAOOO
2:22 WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THERES A MOUSE ON GHOSTBURS SHOULDER
You sound very Filipino hmmmmm.........
O:36 time is just 🤣🤣🤣🤣I-i can't 🤣🤣🤣
do you have a 1 hour loop of the outro somewhere?
When dream blows himself up when he is trying to blow up tommys things
I like how SAD-ist is now just everywhere recording everything, if its in the middle of a battle they're probably gonna be wearing a helmet
Are u dirista???
F%$&
Tommy: don't animate that SAD-ist:😎😎😎
uR DRISTA
Techno before the whole blowing up l’manburg to tommy: WELCOME HOME THESEUS!  ....literally gets hit by lightning: SO LONG THESEUS!
Someone tell me outro music
"I WAS DOING SO WELL... NOOOO-"

A animation about The Egg would be cool
your voice is so cute
She's now a youtooz what's next a marketable plushie?
I was literally dying LMFAO
I FUCKING LOVE THE MCYT FANDOM HOLY FUCK THIS IS GOOD
Tommy’s moms transition is so cool
also the clip of dream teleporting on phil’s stream and saying “i am out of the prison”
Plot twist: sadist is secretly drista
She did a transition between cinematic view and the regular aspect ratio to show how it wasn't "part of the movie." The amount of thought and effort put into this is amazing.
So long Theseus 🐽
i wuv da dweam smpeee !!
Ranboo do look cute tho

LMFAO WILBUR REALLY SAID: "Alright and Sadist also put this one in- *SWEAR* "
SAD-ist kinda sounds like BM0 not gonna lie, and it makes this vid even better.
Sad-ist finally getting her own Youtooz yeyyyyy :D
from now on, im just going to watch blooper reels and wear a stupid smile as i imagine sad-ist behind the camera :)
I hope you do more your funny by :D
jacks watching ur video
Dat laugh do Jesus Tommy that day laugh be god
I am pretty sure that the mini SAD-ist is a combo of Minecraft + Undertale + Hamilton + (what I assume is) Naruto. I don't know what the cup(?), pen, mask, shoes, cookie, and the other things are references too. Either that or I am way overthinking this.
dude SAD-ist wore a white circular mask before it was cool
"burning in the rain"
Tommy the bad luck charm.
They did very well to not have so many bloopers
why do animators always have such calming voices
tommy: dont animate that!  sadist: did yall hear sum??
I love hearing dream go "that wasn't in the script" so much. It really shows that this is all just fun and games and it ain't all serious
TUBBOOOOOOO
this is the best animation.
SADDIST <3
i legitimately found you FROM the youtooz page. ur content is fun, take my sub
oh no the ground cookie :(
Just bought youtooz
Tommy: *gets struck by lightning*  Techno: "SO LONG THESEUS"
IT UNSUBCRIBED ME >:C
how many times has god smited tommy already?
i'm winding down after the big sad, hi 👋🏻
Ranboo is such a good actor but discord ruined the moment
1:31 DREAM FALLING INTO THE SCENE HELP HAHAHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1:26 THE WAY SADIST WAS JUST LIKE LIMPERING HAHAHA OMG PLS
Technoblade held the Violin right TvT this means so much to me <3 tysm u r amazing

I just love your animations its so cool and detailed
POV: you were from the new sad ist video and now youre here
Ur at is so gooood I can draw but I can’t animate
Them getting mad because they have to "film it again" just makes me wheeze          Like Ramboo: "I was doing so weeeeellll!!NOOOOOOOoooooo!"
Who else thinks that SAD-ist should be in the dream SMP?
"Why Sadist kinda sound like Drista, hmm.. i think I am seeing a pattern here."
love the youtooz
Sadist quick question. Are you Asian by Any chance?
Wait sad-it’s is a girl I thought it was a boy lmao
Buying the Sad-ist YOUTOOZ later feeling good
What’s the name of the undertale song at the beginning
OMG I loved when dream killed himself and then Tommy just dieing of laghter! :D
Tommy: *"Don't animate that"* Sad-ist: *"Y'all hear sum'n?"*
I love your vids, plz do more (if you want, this comentery is from brazil :D)
i like how most of the bloopers is when tommy is in it
I wish I was as good as drawing as you
Sadist dancing at the end is very threatening
dream: **accidentally commits die from tnt**
He still animated the bloopers...  That’s what I call talent.
0:10 wait that's today 🙀
#1 excuse to not empty the dishwasher: MOM, I'M IN A WAR!
THE LIGHTNING WAS TIMED WITH MY DISCORD NOTIFICATIONS WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Can't wait until they see this
I missed the YouTube saddist toy
Hold up how ducking old r u?
her voice is like drista
When dream blow himself up you should have done something with the chat or something
I literally told myself if the lightning clip wasn't in here, I would scream (I didnt scream)
Sad-ist is a filipino?
*MOM I'm IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM !!!*
Plot twist: SAD-ist is actually Drista.
Alt title: demonic screaming for 3 mins and 36 seconds
I like your channel SAD-ist  :)
Nobody talking bout her tongue being a heart
You sounds like you would be BMO's mom
Hello, can you do an animation of the sadest moments on dream smp
1:51 transition is so smooth wtf
I love how the youtooz has the hallow night needles inside the grass block and the Hamilton poster right next to it its really neat
I am watching Today when the youtooz is    coming

Everyone is talking about the video but what about the outro that’s the best outro ever
Oh I'm late

Why do I ship sadist and dream

HEY SAD-ist CAN ME PRIV CHAT YOU ON DISCORD BEC I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME WHIT DECISION OF DREAM SMP
I love how dreams ghost's hoodie looks so fluffy
You sound a lot like bmo
Sad-ist the competition has ended what to do now😀😨🥺😦😕😁

you sound a bit like BMO
I didnt know Sadist was a girl. Amazing animations btw
Does no one ever talk about the lightning... that rarely hits people... hits Tommyinnit during a shoot?
Ohhh u posed thus beforemy birthday
She is a real ARTIST honestly
Congrats girl!
tommy dying all bloopers video
Yup free serotonin right here
Man I hope I  win the youtooz good luck everyone that joined
Dream SMP? More like Meme SMP. Because every time someone makes a joke, the Internet goes INSANE no matter what it is, including AUTOTUNED BEES!!
SAD-sit, the last person I could watch without getting bored within 2 seconds related to the dream smp
NEW ONE COMING TOMORROW AHHHHHHHHHHH
Love your work, Sad, hope to see more!
I've been subbed for nearly a year now and congrats on the content
you could say that tommy was SHOCKED I am not sorry.
imagine a dsmp movie.....              then they add bloopers in the end..
shut up with youtooz HAVE MORE ANIMEATIONS
Me when I saw Ranboo: "Which side is the black side? I just think I'm colour bli-"
LOL DREAM DIE
The struggle of sadist is shown here
Does it deliver to the Philippines ❓
Sad ist fans: VOICE REVEAL!!!  me who watches jack manifold: I am four parrallel universes ahead of you
1:31 me entering a situation I’m woefully unprepared for
sadist check if ur white listed
This was great although I was fully expecting techno saying "the adults are speaking" and tommy responding with "hey... :'(" to make it in, I loved all the scenes you chose though ♡♡♡
When tommy laughs he sounds like he got drunken more than a billion beers 💀
Bet my whole life savings that the youtooz is gonna sell out within 30 seconds
I feel like tommy force’s his laugh
2:08 when the fundy is sus 😈
Sad ist: I have youtooz now! The community: MEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEEMEMMEMEMEMEMEMEME
*Oh my gosh the little dances at the end-*
I hate Tommys laugh
YO THAT'S POGGERS
Wait I’m confused- does the SMP personally know you or just know your gonna animate them?
U sound like drista are u drista saddist is drista
i like the dancing sadist in the ending
YASSS
What I liked the most was the Sad-ist dance at the end of the vid..😄
Yey, sadist youtooz is dropping on my bday :D
Not gonna lie but the outro kinda cute :3
SAD-ist are you Pilipino?
If there is talking sadist, who is non talking sadist?
I’m too poor to afford a youtooz due to the Filipino economy
.    .
You know Tommy's the life of the party if he's part of almost all the bloopers
Question did you start out as just a random person that animates the DSMP and now like your the official animator for the DSMP or what?
"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A W A R MUM"
hey!! do you think you could do a tutorial on how you animate? love your videos! 💕
Ya voice reveal
You are amazing and I love all of these.
When Tommy gets smited: AAAAAAAA Techno: so long Theseus
you would be a good commentary channel, the thing in the beginning reminded me of andre terbei
%90 tommy laughing %10 ranboo
0:05   I want to buy it,but I can't because I'm Korean and a student... :(
SAD-ist: cmon guys, how did you mess up AGAIN, we need to record this >:(
Oh i remember the hamilton days :(((((
*rembers when sad-ist joined my discord server and we chatted for a while but i was scared i would get in trouble for having a online friend*   ah good times good times * sips tea *  oh and i've been here since she had like 10k NOW SHE HAS 2 MIL LIKE YESSS
Me: talking to sad-ist Me a minute later: oh great they broked the sricpt 😂
that makes no sense but pls continue
When are they going to add SAD-ist to the Dream smp?
PLEASE make an animation of Wilbur’s revival!!
wait a minute just realized that this mans name looks kinda like sadist (SADE-ist) uhhhhh
You should make a animation of dream and sapnap under lava fight
You know you're insane when your hallucinations' discord crashes
Ghostbur: Tommy... i want you to bring me back to life. Wilbur in hell: NO *Tommy gets zapped*
I just can’t unsee the subtitles at 2:09 “I’m in the middle of a warm mummy”
Youtooz drops TOMORROW
How do I be as cool as you
Sad-ist being a camera operator works since the previous animatics about the dream smp had a cinematic style, almost as though they were a movie.
Sadist qna ???
Omg the Youtooz are soo cute!
Tommy:Dont animate that! SAD-ist:*Animates it and puts it in the bloopers*
The sadists' dancing in the end.
Is she getting paid by the youtubers..? Or just doing it for fun? Hopefully she starts her own series with own characters, she's a great animator. :3
:)
Omg the final screen!! I love it!!
I'm not the only one who came from Tommy, Right?
Your so good make  more plese
It's funny how they constantly mention SAD-ist asking her to make Bloopers everytime they f*** up
amazing just keep up the great work : D
voice reveal
"I can't empty the dishwasher i'm live!"
VOICE REVEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:11  ranbo: "Why didn't you blow it up immediately" Dream: "oops just one second"  Gets command panel and blows everything up Ranbo: O-O
The dancing trio and that song fit so well lmao
Alr but can we talk about how adorable Ranboo looks?

Hahaha, this was great. Also, I love the little dancing SAD-ists at the end c'x

Who else was looking at the end screen on repeat?
2:46 "So Long Theseus"

Nice
Banana          C       O       O        L
I was just thinking, imagine if SAD-ist and Derivakat created a video together
Do you only use FlipaClip for your animations? ( also as a person using FlipaClip this is VERY GOOD ON PHONE!)
Tommy. IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM   His friends. Making fun of him
Omg seriously the way you draw them we gorgeous😍
0:46 1:51  THE TRANSITION WOW😭
why does sadists character at the ad look like mexican dream

I like the little dancing Sadists at the end of the vid they were cute

This is so well done <3
fun fact:you saw 3 verified youtubers in the comments except sad-ist

SAD-ist best gurl
Whenever they use their GUI in this video, it reminds me of Sword Art Online
Yay the filipino youtooz

t h e  u n d e r t a l e  m u s i c
Mom I don’t think you understand I’m in a war right now

1:50 the transition from the game to his room tho😭😂
Yay now i can look at your youtooz and ask myself if you are happy or sad
What software are you using to make this
Dream: *dies  Techno: *"CANON"*
More.
The yootooz is the same time as my cousins bday
When tommy laughed i felt it.
tommy sounds lowkey asthmatic when he laughs-
ใดๆ คือผลงานดีมากกก😳
Tommy:do not animate that. Peoples:try us 😌
I can't belive that sad-ist is actually a filipino
this is so cute aww
The wheeeeeeeeeeeezing  episode
Sadist keep  up the good work
SAD-ist every time this happens: ...another animatic gone...
You sound like drista wtf
Idk why but the accent is the icing to the video for me ✋✨
Oh God,She Has A Physical Form
Luv ur vids!!!!!
Tommy is a child of course he’d have the most bloopers
Sad-ist in 1:25 is having a breakdown
petition for sadist to join dream smp as the anti-dream cause of her mask
YES VOICE REVEAL!
TommyInnit laughing complication
"i`m in the middle of a WAR mum!"
I JUST SCREAMED OUT OF LAUGHTER AND EVERYONE IS ASLEEP IM DEAD
I'm still waiting for an animation with the "Dynasty" song by Miia
I just pissed on my sad-ist youtooz
Absolute perfection except we were missing “YEAH DADDY DREAMM”
3:12 Ranboo: I'm suffering with DID, Dream, do you understand that? Dream: wait, wait, let me dissociate.
1:17  I remember that  I laughed so hard I got lightheaded
The giant eyes in Tommy's skin translate to giant eyes in the animations
Honestly, what you have added to the SMP is just incredible, and you prob get that a lot, but in all sincerity, the time and effort put into the videos is just incredible and the finished products are really easy to follow, for the most part, again, keep up the great work and I love the content.
the beginning keeps confusing me Hello, toughen sad is here Hello, tauchen sad ist hier Hello, taughen sad-ist here
I love that your Youtooz has a nod to your old Hamilton animations. I loved those back in the day. You have also improved so much since then. It's great to see you grow.
SAD-IST
3:28 ‒ Oh my God, is that MinuteEarth? :v
I’m interested
I’m actually gonna get one of your yootooz!
Wow, SAD-ist Youtooz, what?
I was doing so well NOO-
0:44 - 0:47  that transition from Minecraft to real life was smooth
I wish i could buy the youtooz :(
I’m so happy for you deserve this
bahala na pero pag gagawa si sad-ist ng tagalog dub ng animations nya ewan nalang.
When dream said hello he sounded almost exactly like George
IM IN A WAR M U M
IT COMES ON THE DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY
Did you voice bemo
that on my moms b day
Okay this sounds weird but how does a giveaway work- IM SORRY IM KINDA NEW TO GIVEAWAYS :(((
Sad ist is a girlLLLL
I LOVE THIS
💀
Now I wanna see sad-ist do a sad moment in the dream smp
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Around how much money will the youtooz cost?
Just realized your youtooz has a Hamilton photo I love Hamilton
You should put the one were gostber teaches techno how to make a fishing rod xD
So, SAD-ist, how does it feel to be the dream smp’s favorite animator
i love how 50% of this video is just tommy practically dying
This is so cool
"I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM"
SAD-ist, I know a pretty funny short for you to do, it would be shadowapples when he said "Imagine your in the woods alone, it's a cold and dark night, you don't know what's round' any corner, all you could hear was the fierce winds howling, if you was to be murdered out here nobody would hear, you would be lost, you suddenly here something else, is that an animal? or is it a human endanger. You stand still for a sec' and you can barley see what's in front of you, you keep your ears focused and you hear it again, and but this time a lot clearer and the noise you here is a man saying "Hey guys welcome back to another bedwars video."" and you draw exactly that :( (A frown for u SAD-ist)
for all the parts if sad-ist added the in game Minecraft chat
are some of the audio used in the animations re-done for them? wondering since first blooper seemed to be that since Wilbur said for Sad-ist to put this in before cursing
TALKING SADIST?
I fucking love the way dream falls back into frame
olaaa🇵🇭 oh wait-  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kamustaaaa 🇵🇭 :] *Quack🦆*
Mom ruined it Xdxdxdxdxe XD
dis coo
so good!
Awww her voice is adorable also the little dances are just -chefs kiss- <3
Before Time, when Tommy was born, God said:  *LET HIM HAVE SANDPAPER FOR VOCAL CORDS*
OMG WHAT PLATFORM DO U USE OMG
Best animator?? Like if agree
Why is no one talking about the dancing mini sad-ists at the end???
i want this figure so much edit: I didn't win
HELP I KEEP GETTING MR BEAST ADS ;(
i really hope sad-ist’s back is okay after carrying this whole fandom on her back
Me realizing that since SADist actually works with dream the face reveal in the Dream vs Technoblade video is canon:
Did you notice her mask looks like dreams mask
I feel bad for SAD-ist just hearing the first blooper just Wilbur just shouting out (censored).
Tommy: gets struck by lightning  Wilbur: ha ha
“I’m in a war mum” tommy
Wilber: CUM...  Wiburs neighbors: Wtf....
Pls more of this
so is tommy getting exiled just scripted?
“Im in the middle of a war mum!”  Man dont you hate it when you’re in war but need to do the dishes
The way Wilbur looks so proud 0:37
sadist looks so done and the :( makes it even better
Important event: -Exists-  Tommy: *LIGHTING*
The transition from minecraft Tommy and real life Tommy was smooth
The fact that tommy was talking about not putting anything else in front of lmanburg right before he was asked to empty the dishwasher makes it 1000% funnier
I was in the bring me back stream
That dance at the end tho
tommy got stuck by lighting during the war for lamburg
I just wanna imagine some people watching dream amp and never realizing they all are acting
oh my lol
Sad-it’s voice revealed
Your the best person who makes videos
I should have a yootooz
Tommy: don’t animate that  Sadist: F*ck you
I love the dancing SAD-ist’s
I'm impressed with how far you've got nice job keep up the good work!🥰🤗
So talented even from her HK days
Why does sad-ist sound like BMO?
Hey the youtooz releases a day after my birthday
Best animator
your voice sounds nice! <3
I don't understand how I only now just realized that in the picture frame behind the grass block there's a picture for hamilton.
Fun fact: this is the first time i heard her voice
are you that short in real life or,........
Sad-ist. Ur. A. Filipibo.   Just like me

YOOO voice reveal!

I really want to enter the giveaway but my mom doesn’t allow me to have Twitter
Tommys wheezing
They never tell you REAL story...
@SAD-ist wait, your a girl? I really thought you were a boy, aww man 😪😪
Why is she the SAD-ist when she is doing so well in life right now
Fun Fact: You have a 1 in 100,000 chance of being struck by lightning in a Minecraft thunderstorm.
What programs do you use for your animations?
The fact that most of them are Tommy dieing because of wheezing so much is killing me, also this may be a dumb question but what video was the first blooper from? I'm still quite new to the whole thing but I have manage to catch up quite a bit.
Dream glitches slightly while talking to Ranboo and I love it more than I should
WATS THE INTRO SONG PLEASE SOMEONE TILL ME
For me your not sad your feeling happy
Cool

Imagine if she joined the SMP
love how the aspect ratio changes in the bloopers, really makes it look like raw open matte footage
The youtooz It's dropping on my birthday 😭
am I the only one who loves the transition from the role-play to the blooper scenes-
is sadist form the Philippines
Is it available in the Philippines? The youtooz?...
Why does anyone not see something wrong in the thumbnail?????
There’s so much little details in every animation you do that is in line with the person’s personality, that’s pretty cool
2:30  tommy shock
Not only you are so talented, but also absolutely creative
Sad-ist why does it sound like swidish
I was scrolling through YT with the video playing at the start, wif the YouTooz promo and I legitimately thought there was an ad playing.  I was like "Imma skip this ad" Went to the vid And realized "Oh. Shit. It's the video."
Brillliant
a lil sad dance)
that last blooper has always been my favourite
The tommy struck by lightning made me feel 5 emotions at once
Are you Filipino SAD-ist?
this is so embarrassing for them LMAOO
may 21 is my b daaay yay'
I love how sadist is like a director and is making a movie and she’s just in the background all the time filming
0:12 Homer Simpson
Best filipino that ever lived!
Who else thought she was from the US or UK, but she was actually from the Philippines
This roleplay wouldnt be great without some bloopers 😂😂
:D yey
Only legends cam understand that background usic of taken from undertale at start
is it bad i have already memorised it in the span of three days???
I LOVE. YOUR. ANIMATIONS.SO.MUCH
sad ist just became a dream smp trend rider while throwing everything else aside
*is interested*
Ranboo: I was doing so well NOOOOOOO       Me be like: why is he saying this like it happened multiple times? Its a live stream.... I don't trust YouTube anymore
I love the talking sadist lol
"I was doing so well! NOOOOO—" 😂
You have Youtooz!?!??!?!?! *adds to list*  1. Technoblade. 2. Wilbur Soot. 3. SADist.
Im happy since shes filipino (i think since my friend said that)
Where is the dady dream meme  :v
LOL XD FUNNY
I rlly want ur youtooz but my mom wont let me :(  Edit : i forgot i want ur youtooz bc its adorable and cool
1:30  Techno: Canon
In the subtitles, tommy says, “I’m in a warm, mummy!” (Not kidding)
I love the dancing sadists
I think Tommy's laugh needs surgery for sure
Great work! I especially lived the colab you did with Camila that one ended up so epic
Cake time
*CRYING INTENSIFIES" I HAVE TO LEARNNNNNN *CRY Also good animation mam
I laugh every single time I watch this, keep up the good work! :) I love how most of them are Tommy XD
i love how you animate ghostbur (:
She sounds like Drista       LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
tommy: *don’t animate that*  animators/artists: *speedrun doing an animation using the audio*
The idea of sad-ist being the director, trying to make this "cool action film", and the Dream-smp members being the cast, that won't stop goofing around.
this makes me happy
Why does Tommy laugh like he just discovered lungs jesus fuck
Being live doesn’t make you any less responsible ;)
Three days late but let me tell you have a beautiful voice
huh you sound exactly how i imagend you'd sound
Why does Sad-ist has a  sad in it?
Imagine just hearing your son say that they're in a war
Techno has a bloopers but kind of better for me. Just sayin'. I would love if u make 1
tommy laughing is the best part of this video.
SAD-ist: Creates Dream Manhunt Animation  Subs And Views: My Time Has Come

Sad-ist we need more bloopers they are to funny
I hope i win the giveaway, you’re awesome

Anime the end up the dream smp
Anime the end of the dream smp
Talking sad-ist :D
Undertale music
as a fellow filipino im really impressed you don’t have much of an accent, even my dad (who works as an online english teacher) has a pretty obvious accent
Tommy: my things Dream: cut that
I had a weird DREAM about making a suggestion of a face reveal but instead of a real face, SAD-ist just removes her character's mask.
SICK

The ending card is so cute I love it
hes a she
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH, I KEEP WATCHING IT
I love how whenever she’s in frame with them she’s so smol
hello am new
I just noticed how Tommy has a different outfit in the moment with Ghostbur. Think it resembles his character growth from being a child to a manipulated child. And it also shows Sadist’s attention to detail about that. And also the transitions from in-game to irl is just beautiful, never seen any other transition like it-
im pretty sure youre faline san
lil dancing sadists at end are best part omg so cute .·´¯`(>▂<)´¯`·.
0:35 me when i stub meh toe ;-;
Bro your animation are fire 🔥

WAIT WHEN DID YOU GET 2 MILLION SUBS
2:46 CHEF   kiss
I wonder, is she part of the Dream Smp? I feel like she should be part of it.
Wait sad ist is a girl?🧍
Okay but hear me out ...   Sad-ist = BMO
3:27 Ranboo cries cute
ayo whats the music? can anyone give me the link
I wanna buy the youtooz but I'm broke
Wait what?! Shes a woman?!!
LMFAOOOOOOOOO!
You should've added when Techno didn't make then wither correctly and had to remake them when he was saying "the die like one" to tommy! But amazing animation it looks great
When dream dose face reveal you do one
finally the god has giving us a you tooz : D
Wilbur : C**kn Sad-sit: no
She gained an accent midway
Dream blowing himself up is gold every time
I’m sad that I couldn’t have been here as soon as it came out 😞
pls do the dirt house one
My birthday is on the launch of your youtooz🙂
I love Sadist and her animation it just makes my day , I'm surprised that they did not put her Dream Smp and if they ever did I would be happy.
YOU ANIMATE SO WELL GO CRAZY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
Lmao sadist is literally a unofficial part of the smp and everyone knows it
we need more of these, I love these sm <333!!!
Whenever I hear Tommy wheeze-     *Fun Pain :D*
make a ranboo animatic
i agree
guys i have just noticed we have never seen her legs i think-
these are all so cool!!!! i really hope that someday you can make somewhat of an "anime" from the dsmp. your art style is so mesmerizing
Alpharad sponsor song, Wilbur outro.    Perfection
Alternative title: How to bully Tommyinnit
3:28 DANCE
If you name is SAD-ist then should dream be HAPPY-ist?
I love how basically all the Dream-SMP related creators/streamers play Undertale music. For example, the beginning of this video “Dating Start!” was playing, which is he song that plays when you date Papyrus. In the beginning of Jack’s stream he most likely plays  “Another Medium” plays, which plays in the Hotland while solving puzzles with Alphys.
Yea, you guys don’t stand a chance, just give me the youtooz Sad-ist 😌🤙🏽
IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM
Tommy: that’s going in the bloopers reel   Me: WHAT THE FU-
Yes
I was here :)
i like talking SAD-ist ngl
Imagine not liking this video
You should color your animations
I should not have laughed this hard XDDDD
"I'm in the middle of a warm mummy"                                                               wtf
Can we give a shoutout to Tommy's mother for still treating him like a normal kid? It helps make Tommy so much more relatable to his audience. Even if he's making millions, the kid still has chores to do like the rest of us lmfao
Nice work sad-ist
Hopefully you don't get canceled on Twitter because your youtuz ran out of stock
I  *L O V E*  THE ANIMATION!!!!
woah dancy dance
hey,i saw someone with your name on tiktok. Is it actually you???
bro she is amazing. I can't believe she got a youtooz from animating. Good job
She sounds like B.M.O
your voice is SO cute !!!
I never noticed that she was a girl
I KEEP WATCHING THIS, IT'S JUST SO FUNNY ISTG-
His dieing
I love sad-ist's voice, she sounds adorable! Also the first scene was hilarious lol
I wonder what the people in Wilbur office think of him lmao
pov: you’re gonna see me everywhere
Please do bad and the egg
Do bad and egg
You like hamilton?? 0:08
I remember finding you when you he sent posted in years and it was just Hamilton animatics lmao 👁👅👁
OH THIS IS SAD-ist
I LOVE YOUR ANIMATIONS
Aaahhh I just realized that SAD-ist has a Hamilton poster on her Youtooz!
“What the tha wa wa wa the the what the”- tommyinnit
TO FUNNY
Those dancing SADists at the end tho
Tommy: "Please, do not animate that!" Animators: “Y'all hear sumn?"
sadist voice reveal ?????
Oh my god it's so good 💕💕💕💕
Da hesk it is funny.. The dishwasher..
Love the vids keep it up
i remember when u were animating on flipaclip and now u have a youtooz! very happy for u! ill be buying one! :D
Sadist dancing is the best thing i ever seen in my life
This is such a good concept and as always incredibly well made!
Love how most of these are tommy XD
It's funny whenever tommy laughs he's having a meltdown
At this point youtooz is just like “you a youtuber are you in debt well guess what NO MORE “ and I like it
but ranboo animated-
I LOVE ur animations!!!
link to first clip? 😭☝️
Sadist do you use a tool for your animations and if so what tool?
Tommy really said he’s in a war to his mother 😭🖐
We NEED a part 2 with the “daddy dream” blooper!
What animation app do you use (sry if this has been asked over a million times I JUST RLY NEED TO KNOW)
erm...... weirrrddddd
Talking sadist isn’t real she can’t hurt you Talking sadist:
HOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO GOOD Love it, keep working girl
I like how you go from the game characters to real life
Imma get dat youtooz but N O W
VOICE REVEAL LETS GOOOOO
Did I just see a Hamilton minecraft shield?
No
When tommy laughs it sounds like someone is choking him while he is laughing
I love the transitions from the game to real life
Can someone just struck by the lightnong and then laugh till ded?  Tommy:yes
IVE SEEN THAT DREAM DED BLOOPER LMFAOOOO
Wait if TommyInnit knows you does that mean you are in the SMP
“BAHALA KA”
Petition to add Sadist to the Dream SMP
Alt title: everyone failing and laughing in every scene
Bloop
When I joined Tommy's live I saw dream place the TNT then blow himself up
Tommy is in almost every single one of them
LMAO I love ghost dream
youtooz lets go your one of the queens of yt now
I need them to invite SAD-ist as a guest because she deserves it for these amazing animations also, now I owe people money because I bet that the next video would be about Wilbur's revival
sadistooz!!!
Sad-ist is a GIRL!!! Nope I’m unsubbing I’m not a simp.
they might have a script but it still pretty funnny ;)
This video was just out of the blue
I love that you’re getting noticed boo
Your selling it on my birthday 😂😂😂🥳🥳🥳🥳
I would like to point out that motherinnit got a speaking role in a sad-ist animation before ranboo did
SAD-ist should be whitelisted on the smp, but in spectator mode, so she can be the cameraman.
Poggers?!! Even late
THE GIVEAWAY IS THE DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY
love itttt
day 1 of asking for anime battle between smp members
love that tommy is in pretty much every blooper
Legit how are you so good *I cri*
Ranboo making lore on the spot and DM'ing dream about it  -Dream who didn't get the message: H U H
When your parents dont alow you to get youtooz and you can't even have Facebook so you can't even join the giveaway        (Dieing on the inside)
I LOVE UR VOICE
guys did she really film that? like is she a camera man?
How is this sooooo amazing
Sad-ist i swear your so talented
How to be immortal 1. *Be the camerawoman.*
Sadistusu
You kinda have a filipino accent
Can u make more blooper vids? their so funny! -Cookie
Wait do you actually work with them?
I've never bought a youtooz but i think i might buy this one
Ur a filipina right :D? Pls answer I just wanna know ;v;"
If this was a real anime made by sadist i wouldnt do the dishes ever in my life after that
0:34 Now sad-ist also put this one in *R E D A C T E D* -wilbur 2021
If SAD-ist is the cameraman, then my headcanon is that she's more powerful than any of the members of dream smp.
I like how at this point they know that she is gonna animate any plot streams, even bloopers
If you had mincrafted i think you'd get into the dream smp
She sounds cool
bro dream saying "hello" sounded like he was on an actual phone call with someoenE LMAOO
Technically we can make video of bloopers and 90% of it would been technos 😂 😂 😂
I love you sad-ist! you inspired me to try and start animating, and I'm sure you've inspired others as well
I love ur animations bdw
iloveyousomuch!!!
Sadist could make a turtle look epic. Anyone else agree that her Render of Techno is amazing in her animations?
The Hamilton shield tho
Does anyone else think that this is kinda cringe? Like a bunch of teenagers and young adults playing minecraft and pretending that their in a fucking movie or something.
You kinda sound like my friend ngl!
They laughed so hard they hurt their throat — w —
Sadist is the living incarnate of the "WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN" meme and I love it
Fans that are adults: YAY Fans that are kids: NOOOOOOO
my favourite thing about this video is that it implies sad-ist is just running around the smp with a camera waiting for lore to happen
Tommy’s mum calling him to empty the dishwasher in the middle of an argument is one of the best bloopers ever.
Your the best :)
i love the little nails on the minecraft block! that is so cute!!!  and sad considering quirrel...
alternative title: *tommy coughing his lungs out for 3 minutes straight*
I LOVE THIS A COMPLETELY REASONABLE AMOUNT
Can you do a drista vid
I love the fact that tommy CHOKES after getting rekt by lightining
I love Sadist's Ranboo so much. We need an angsty Ranboo Sadist animatic.
What did willbur screamed anyways
Nice voice
LMAO THAT WAS GREAT
Those dislikes are from ROBLOX PLAYERS! GET OUTA HERE ROBLOX
Where is the 2 hour of mini SAD-ists Dancing?
your voice is pretty
Think of all the cloths that are in the dishwasher! -Fundy
IRL WILBUR IS AMAZING!!!
MAKE ANOTHER ONE
where's tommy getting rekt by a zombie
WAIT 21ST?! THATS MI SISTERS BDAY YO HAHHAHA
When Tommy's mom called him to empty the dishwasher when he was in the middle of an arguement, I legit fell out of my chair laughing.
Me chilling drawing eyes
Woa sadist dancing adorable
:) hi
Yosh the God of Dream SMP
I WAS SOO HAPPY THAT SAD-ist POSTED A VIDEO  NGL sad-ist should have more subs than she has already   SUB TO SAD-ist for more vids!!!
hello ate!! you have epic animations :DD
I think Sadist should join the Smp instead of just recording.
I'm over here
You should have added the part in the Pogtopia vs L'manberg where Dream kills Quakity and says "Dream just killed a Mexican"
i love how when tommy’s mom called him for the dishwasher it went from i side the game to the outside, very pogchamp :D
3:26 for 1 sec ramboo was sound like tenchoblade
More exquisite Content
Ranboo's pupils getting smaller when Dream comes to the panic room. Catboo is canon change my mind.
tommy and dream laughing after dream accidentally blew himself up is wholesome to me for some reason
I didn't even realize the first time, but when the camera zooms out of the scene at around 1:50, Tommy doesn't have his braces anymore, so only c!Tommy has braces.
I did the twitter one so many time it just wont work please fix this
Ghosttown
U r epic 1 new sub
Sadist i love your content very much but im really poor to buy your youtooz. So sorry and thanks for great content love you so much❤️
Could you do color version?
Dream blowing himself up by accident will never not be funny Tommy was practically dying xD
Am use my data because my mom firgot to pay for wifi and i watch this on 360p🤦‍♀️
Sad-ist voice reveal? O-o ur voice is just as nice as ur animatics n thats rlly fuckin nice uvu
i like how you animated yourself not trying to laugh at dream killing himself and you're barely holding on to it
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa voice revveeaaalllllll
ABOUT FLIPPING TIME-
May 21 is my son birthday
Lol
Sadist should be added to the dream smp, change my mind
My therapy update!
Ahh, We both are sad.
Main characters of dreamsmp Tommyinnit Wilbur Technoblade Ranboo   motherinnit

Did you get them to voice over???
Ah yes, the hidden dream smp member, the immortal camera artist SAD-ist.
This is amazing
I just noticed sad-ist kinda sound like jaiden animation
Tommy just made it 1000% funnier
:)

Dancing Sad-ist

Me hearing sadist voice for the first time
MUM! I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM
Is it just me or does Tommys laugh sound like he is coughing up his windpipe then swallowing it again?
hi im the opposite of u
Poor ranboo! He was doing so well! 😂
The mask: *:(* Sad-ist behind the mask: *:D*
Dream should add sad ist to dream smp
Is SAD-ist short?? 0:37
The way Dream popped back in and grabbed all his stuff like he was ready to fight, so good.
they don't deserve sadist - or they should at least be paying her or something
bro only a small percentage of your viewers who watched this ARE NOT subscribed respect
1:40  Ah, how incredible an image like that after what happened 👌
SAD-ist and Camila Cuevas sounds so similar and i like that lol
you sound filipino
The Best Animator ever greater then JA
I swear, i need Sadist and Derivakat collab-
1:22 Sad-ist be like: T-T **crying intensifies** 🤣🤣🤣
Lol Filipino ka
Yes.
Hey Sad-ist.....ur voice or ur accent sounds like ur a Filipino :'D ooof
Kind of crazy that Tommy is just as old as me, and makes twice what my dad earns in a year, in one week...
May 21st? That's the day I finally get to see a school again!
Her voice is so cool
why im so poor
you are THE BEST!!!
RANBOOO OH MY GOD
Do u remember doing svtfoe ca  u make an animatic of it I really miss that show
Angsty Ranboo
SAD-ist face belike : ((:<)>)
There should’ve been called Dre SMP 2
1:10
1:14 if only dream landed on the ground and pointing his head at the camera we could've seen his face his mask might be broken
Is it just me or does sad- ist  just kinda sound like drista  <-- dream's sister
YO THATS COOL TO HAVE THEM TALK TO U DIRECTLY TO MAKE CRAP FOR THEM
I cant believe sad-ist is a women
im still shooked tht ur filipina and im filipino tooo
THE YOUTOOZ IS DROPING ON MY BIRTHDAY
tommyinnit laughting for 3 minutes 39 s
Her transitions are still so amazing even when this is a bloopers video holy crap 😮😮
Fun fact/sad fact: sadist means in telegu psycho
-me was about to join the discord sever but if your under 13 yers old will be banned so I just leave since I must respect their choice I just need few more years to join the sever :)-
why is she kinda sounding like jaiden animations??
U sound like BMO but older
No you will not get to see what I wrote
OMG THE TINY SAD-ITS DANCING- I CAN'T- SOooO cuTe- AAAA
Do more of these!!!
God I love the transitions between them and their characters so much
SAD-ist really made the whole smp into a whole frickin movie series
The YouTooz looks like it’s throwing a spear, but the spear is a pen
Hi!
I realised now that sad-ist is a girl
i love how sad-ist still animates tommy with braces
:D
the tnt one... I'm os happy that was animated... I'm crying
BRO is that Hamilton on the shield nice. respect
XDDD
I love it
That outro song brings so much soothouse memories
*I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM*
I just like the idea of animatic borders is there and disappear when its the bloopers one.
Ranboo is the new techno
im sorry how are u allowed to use the hamilton logo? Lin better be getting some money from it
Are u in the dream smp?
Saddist you are very good  Love you ;)
3:25 me when I get an amazing fluke on a math test and get the last 5 problems wrong:
2:08 me when nobody gets my joke:
Plot twist: Sad-ist is Drista
Awww at the end the outro is so cuteee😍
We need more bloopers!!!
This is so cool!!
Motherinnit be swag now
Don't you hate it when your mum calls you to empty a dishwasher, but war is at hand? its a real dilemma that all people go through
I KNEW U WERE FILIPINAAAA
im also  filipino :D
0:25
"No i can't empty the dishwasher mum I'm in the middle of a war"
Tommy just got lighting strike now he is ded
Tommy's laugh cured my depression
Dream inspired youtooz not a bad thing but it's repetitive since dream blew up, a masked design character for skins and avatars blew up
I like the little outro it’s cute
Hmmmmmm  Sad-ist is SUS. Looks like Drista.
Wait sad-ist is a girl?
I give you the biggest sheeeeeeeesh in existence.
everyone be talking about the tommy transition but wilbrs is really good too
This is super cute❤
We all love your animations
Hey, you missing Technoblade
I am definitely getting your yootooz🙂👍🏼
Everyone is talking about the transition at 1:51 but no one is talking about the transition 0:47
0:39 1:21 2:16 SAD-ist reaction tho is soooo cuteeeee.
WHEEEEYYYYY
Funny
Although this is not a serious animation but I definitely love it!
the fact that sad-ist isnt in the dream smp already is mildly infuriating because GOD SHE DESERVES IT.
1:04 tommy be lookin like the ready player one poster
Aww nice voice.. hope you get invited in the smp soon.
Poor ranboo
Sounds like drista
OMG Sad-ist's voice is so goddarn beautiful😍
you're soo coooooool❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just going to say that this is literally a girl version as dream but can do animation.
Omg Voice REVEAL!
its maybe spoiler of next animation
haha i am literally dying
the actors au I didn't know I needed until now. wonderful work as always, SAD-ist. :D
Sad-ist!! Can you do another epic video?
2:00 : *his mother asks to empty the dishwasher* Tommy : I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR- MUM. MotherInnit : It can wait! Empty the dishwasher! Tommy : hAh- Mum- I'm live!
I love at the end Ranboo just goes "I WAS DOING SO WELL" that's me on a Kahhot for school
Her mask was the most disappointed of all
The best part of this video was the end, no questions asked.
SAD-ist your the best animator on earth💙
0:25 that scenes is from another from sadist videos its called dawn of 16th the beggining of the video
Uh oh i let me 5 year old lil sis see this..
@Dream we need sad ist on the smp
Strongest person in dream smp 3. Dream 2. Technoblade.  1. *Camera* *women*
😅😂😂
1:26 she is so mad
Wilbur...My boy gone PUFF 0:37
Let's be honest, who else didn't know SAD-ist was a girl till this? XD
And That's the voice of a Filipino. Well done SAD-ist. keep doing what you love
Tommy's laugh is so contagious lmfao
I wish I had moneyyyyyyyyy😭😭😭😭

When SAD-ist posts a video : noice
Your voice is so pretty!!!
0:56  THE DEATH STARE-

Original comment :)
funny video.
the way Dream faceplanted on his way to get his items was amazing-
I can’t believe sadist got her own yootooz lol
Sad-RISTA
Hahagshsgah XD
I was watching the hog hunt animation and I think the music would be good with an animation of link from the legend of Zelda being corrupted by Ganon  Just an idea for an animation
TOE
When you can’t get the youtooz:
Already completed sad-ists youtooz steps .....What now?
I want this but I'm in indonesia so I can't buy your youtooz :(
2:44 sad-ist as always providing us with the techno content
1:52 Damn, Even in the animatic Tommy's back posture is still horrendous 😂😂😂
I love how there's no bloopers in the first disk war
more plz haha
All the bloopers always seem to happen when tommy is involved and its hilarious. XD
Why was this so funny
It's beautiful. I've been looking at this for 5 hours now
Omg congratulations you edits are rlly good
WHY SHE SOUNDS O MUCH LIKE JAIDEN ANIMATIONS!!!!!!??????
Is No one  gonna talk about the Sad-ist Youtooz Holy it's better than dream
Its now canon that sad-ist is the camera person
L'mandog?
lol
the way sad-ist separates like their character and their irl person is so cool, like when wilbur was talking and tommy was yelling to his mom
I laugh everytime I look at this- Very proud of how far you've come, keep up the good work!❤
heyyy I wanna start animating-- so do you have some advice or smt idk?? it would help a lot :)
This is too good-
the "so long theseus" after tommy got struck by lightning  lmaoooo
Perfect timing tomorrow is my birthday..
Drista will punish dream for messing up on camera by forking his eyes out
"so long theseus"
hey sadist this is a funny with good animation but cant beat mcyt vibing to undertale song's sry
DRISTA????
So cool and funny! New sub
Sadist is practically a god at this that's all I'm saying...
I really like how you have grown over time, you started at FLIPACLIP and now these amazing animations. I love it
Nice youtooz
IM GETTING THAT YOUTOOOZ RIGHT WHEN I CAN SADIST!
kinda sad you didnt put the "YEAH DADDY DREAM" one
Tommy is the blooper master
Lil this is the funniest thing
You have gain another subscriber and a like (great job BTW is amazing)
Ranboo is quaking rn. He got a section.
I love the nail and needle from hollow knight in the youtooz. From your older, non-dream amp stuff
YOUNGBOY BETTER
SAD-ist =sad artist??
I laugh when dream blew up
Tommy's  laugh is the most painful laugh I have ever heard
Gotta love those discord glitches lol. Poor Ranboo he really was doing so well
Sadist I just want to say that your the best and you literally make my day everyone I watch one of your vids
I really hope SAD-ist gets invited to the server
“I can’t empty the dishwasher I’m live” why is that one of the funniest things ever
You should use your voice more often 👍
I KNOW FOR A FACT IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THIS IS GAY
Thus why this video is here:(
This is the reason I wake up in the morning
“MOM IM LIVE!” The best line ever 😂
The lightning was mean’t to hit Ghostbur so that he could come back to life
"I can't unload the dishwasher!  I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR, MUM!!!" - TommyInnit 2020
I love the yootooz
sadist you never disappoint
When you get more subscribers then badboyhalo I’m gonna actually start sobbing FYI
can we just talk about your amazing accent for a second
This is actually the first animator/artist having youtooz
1:28 ***Pterodactyl Noises***
Dream SMP: *Scripted*  MotherInnit: I DON'T THINK SO!
I absolutely love the Hamilton poster on your youtooz! The little nod to your roots there is so cool. You deserve this so much. Even when you were making silly little Hamilton animations they were so so good. I’m glad you’re now getting the recognition you deserve.
Wait sorry are these real? Like are the conversations real
Please make more🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
SAD IST MY BELOVED
Hey Sad ist Are You Nervios When You Talk in this video?
dude the youtooz looks so cute! it's even got a lil nail from hollow knight and just aaa
Baaa
That youtooz looks so cool
I’m convinced Tommy wheezes more than Dream
This just made my day.
Next do Jump in the Cadillac
"Mum, I can't empty the dishwasher right now, I'm in the middle of a war" DEAD XD
Omg this video is so short i didn’t want it to enddddd
First video I didn’t want to end like skoppy said
Okay but the attention to DETAIL when Wilbur turned into his irl wear when he was out of character
Tiny sadist dance yeaaaa go sadist wooo pop off
What sadist is a girl
Can YouTube verify you already?? It's well overdue
ranboos little noodle boy awww
:D
Make it colorful
Guys help me plz. WHAT IS THE SOMG AT THE START OF THE VIDEO
Noice
Hey sad are you just going to do a full movie of the dream smp, I BET IT WOULD BE EPIC, I mean I AM REALLY SURE that people would pay to see
YOOOOO SADIST YOUTOOZ
are you drista?
With you being most known for dream SMP, it makes me want to see what you'd do with a VenturianTale animation, since they're similar to Dream SMP but in GMod and from like 2015 lmao  I know 99% of the VenturianTale fandom likes Dream SMP now. Ik you won't see this, but if you do, search up "Bananacorp VenturianTale", its a good representation of the golden era Oh, and especially "The Return of Jimmy Casket"
She sounds like jaiden animations😂
Plz animate wilburs revival
sad-ist, stop reminding me that I can't buy your youtooz 💔
BYE ALL THE YOUTOOZ!!!
Yay:3
The tiny little people in the screen!!!!!!! I can't--
Nice work! Thanks for the laughs
I love to think that you are just sort of in the background recording everything and then going in and editing it to make it look like a movie XD
‘IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM’  subtitles:  ‘IM IN A WARM MUMMY’
yooo im also a sad sadist we have much in common
Me explaining to my mom why I can’t do the dishes in the middle of my nerf war: 1:51
My favorite was when Dream blew up
*Dream was blown up by Dream*
Is sadist drista?

"I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM" - A Tommyinnit special
so long Theseus
"Im burning in the rain right now"  Actually tommy was
Just discord crashing and malfunctioning is a mood
OKAY BUT THEIR ACTING-
is it just me does sadist sound like drista  unless
The one where Dream died because of fall damage could actually be one of the best bloopers here. But i'm SAD-ISTfied with these. These ones are the best.
I got a question, what App or Program are you using for your animatics to draw the pictures?
i hate how people get a youtooz and i can never get one because my parents won’t let me 😭
SADist's charactor looks like it should be in Undertale.
:)
Just note that Tommy is in almost everyone
OHHHHH MY SSSSCCCCCIEEEEENNNNCEEEEEE SAD-IST IS TALKING
This is great! Also I've never heard your voice :p
the way dream falls at 1:31 MAKES ME LAUGH SO HARD EVERY SINGLE TIME
All bloopers: 10/10. I haven’t fully recovered from the laughter.
This is so amazing
Who needs to catch up with the SMP when they can just watch the bloopers instead?    I should probably get on that before I lose the entire plot.
when will you do your next animation
Dream better let her on the SMP and everyone should be there to give her a huge fucking welcome party!!!!
SHE TALKS NOW
It's beautiful. I've been looking at this for 5 hours now.
epic
2:54 ran oo looks like lady liberty... sorta
I love the cuts to "irl" them

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
You could definitely hear a little bit of her filipino accent! <3
the switching from in game to in real life is so smooth, such an inspiration <3
LMAOOOOO

Idk why but I feel like Sad-ist is Drista or a female version of Dream
Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows  The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.    "News?" asked the taller of the two.    "The best," replied Severus Snape.    The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.    "Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?"    Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke.    The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.    "He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ..." Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.    A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.    The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.    The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room's usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.    "Yaxley. Snape," said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. "You are very nearly late."    The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.    "Severus, here," said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. "Yaxley ¨C beside Dolohov."    The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.    "So?"    "My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall."    The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.    "Saturday ... at nightfall," repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape's black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort's face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort's lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.    "Good. Very good. And this information comes ¨C "    " ¨C from the source we discussed," said Snape.    "My Lord."    Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.    "My Lord, I have heard differently."    Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, "Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen."    Snape was smiling.    "My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible."    "I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain," said Yaxley.    "If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain," said Snape. "I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry."    "The Order's got one thing right, then, eh?" said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.    Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.    "My Lord," Yaxley went on, "Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy ¨C "    Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.    "Where are they going to hide the boy next?"    "At the home of one of the Order," said Snape. "The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest."    "Well, Yaxley?" Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. "Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?"    Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.    "My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have ¨C with difficulty, and after great effort ¨C succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse."    Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.    "It is a start," said Voldemort. "But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister's life will set me back a long way."    "Yes ¨C my Lord, that is true ¨C but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down."    "As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest," said Voldemort. "At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels."    "We are at an advantage there, my Lord," said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. "We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately."    "He will not do either," said Snape. "The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place."    "All the better," said Voldemort. "He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far."    Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, "I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs."    The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter's continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him

i absolutely love the fact you didn't fill real wilbur's eyes in lmao. he is insane irl too i agree
Mum im in a middle of a- in a War mum!
I know this has nothing to do with Dream SMP but I really think Sadist should do an animation for that time two Ender Dragons respawned from an end gateway and nearly destroyed Endlantis.
İs it just me or does her is voice VERY similar to drista's voice
Dream getting blow up*  Dream: no no no! That wasn’t in the script
SAD-ist dancing is kinda cute tho uwu
I actually thought no one could ever animate bloopers but u did it!!!, nice.
sad-ist being a camera man is so hallarious
IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT GHOSTBURS DESIGN??? ITS SO COOL
Dream is now a dead crewmate

Nice job getting #2 on trending. I do not know how Luke made it #1 on trending by being in creative but he did it.
poor ranboo
fun fact: the one where dream accidentally blows himself up is the first dream smp video i watched :D
Not gonna lie sad-ists youtooz might be the first one I get
SAD-ist, can you animate me going so engrossed in this video that I let my ice cream cone drip on my keyboard? (It's ok by the way I cleaned it up lol) Amazing job as always!!

I LOVE WILBUR!!!!!!
Yeyes

Aint gonna lie, I was kinda hoping, "Yeah! Daddy Dream!" Was gonna be in here
Ranboo looks so cute!!!!
Now ppl on twitter are hating on her for liking technoblade when she's part of the minorities he "oFfEndEd". You really can't have a damn opinion on Twitter nowadays.
POV: you're looking to see if TommyInnit has put a comment yet
@TommyInnit

Under the mask, we all know it's GLAD-ist 😂
Tommy’s laugh is everything 🤣🤣💀
I noticed that the first song in the opening is from my favorite game Undertale
HA! So great lololololol
Are we not going to talk about how literally all the blooper clips have tommy in them... I mean it's fax but still, we love that. Thank you saddist again!! Wuv u, keep it up gurly! Thanks for the glorious content 😁
Is no one about to talk about the fact that we heard SAD-ist's voice without the choppiness of Philippine wifi calls    Edit: SAD-ist is Filipino  **ded comment**
DEGROWTH is 10000% the best way to combat and adjust for climate change.  - Demand Legislators to decentralize agriculture to reduce food-waste.  (And promote international trade ONLY between off-season produce.) - Invest in Right to Repair and 3d accessible 3d Printing to avoid  costly tranportation - Tax/fine/criminalize industries that continue to exploit worker safety  and use of fossil fuel emissions when renewable energy is both  affordable and able to be adopted. - Invest military programs toward reforestation projects and  humanitarian aid, not weapons and warfare equipment sales. - Hold politicians and industries responsible for perpetuating climate  change denial responsible for criminal neglect.  Climate change is going to destroy even the richest of countries. No one is safe if we  continue to ignore the necessity to dramatically change both our values  and our global infrastructure AWAY from exponential Growth and GDP.
Filipino SUPREMECY RISE UP!!
I thought that was drista talking at the beginning of the vid
Tommy and dream laughing together makes me happy
SAD-ist you’re a good animater
BRUH THE AD MADE ME THINK I WAS ABOUT TO GET RICK ROLLED
this is quite possible the worst youtube channel i think i've ever come across..
THANK YOU SADDDIIISSSTRR
Are u filipino? Cause i googled you
Guys I think this was a SAD-ist voice reveal😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
This has so made my day
Please do a collab with derivakat or Kanaya

I live for the dancing sad ists at the end
You are like girl dream
0:10 💳💥💥💥💳💥💥💳💥💳💥💥💥💳💥💳💥💥
For the lol
you're adorable lol. I like you, you deserve a handshake.
Lol, the time of the YOUTOOZ dropping is on my friend birthday party
I have entered in the giveaway, love ur content btw :P
I love the bloopers, they remind me that this is all a minecraft show and I should NOT get so emotional :)
Omg the Bloopers Are Here!
Imagine yelling at your Mom that you don't empty the dishwasher, because you are in the middle of a war
Smol dancing SAD-ist is giving me life
I WONT GIVE UP ON LIFE 🧬
:)
I’m going to just believe that Sadist has become the DreamSmp movie director.
awsome as normal :)
Tommy: DO NOT ANIMATE THAT Literally every animator: *I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that*
Sad ist are you dream's sister? Answer me.
have tou notice sadist voice is similar voice of drista
have you
That laugh ju- moi god
Sad-ist animating herself gives me thousands years of life
I NEED that youtooz
Me: *waiting until someone mentions the shady oaks smp*  (I'm not forcing anyone okay T>T)
now this is the SADist animation you need to see to understand the dsmp lore
When will u do a origins smp?
Sadist dancing is the best part of this video (other than the youtooz of course)
When the dream smp ends, you gotta make a long ass movie that contains all of the events
Le smal dancin Sad-ist's are sooooo cutte
is it really a blooper without tommy hacking up a lung
Man, I love these animations so much, I could only imagine what my character what would look like in this style
I had no reason to reject this recommendation
These are just weird without music lol
I had no reason to reject this recommendation
AHHHH I LOVE IT
Sad mask but laughing inside heh?
Tommy’s laugh makes everything better istg
dope
I love how sadist is the little camera person
Tommy always says “Don’t animate that” and that is SAD-its’s cue to animate it 😂 (this was so good btw-)
Most of these involve or include Tommy.
It is impossible to be as late as me
I just realized... It wasn’t Phil or Techno that braided Tommy’s hair: it was Ghostbur. I’m crying before the Passerine animatic even comes out wtf
verified
I was doing so well nooo
Bedrock YouTooz
Ghostbur looks EPIC
SAD-IST wore a mask before it was cool
Beautiful💕
Me: disappointed she didn't include fundy saying "that's going in the animatics" on the dishwasher blooper XD
When SAD-ist makes you HAPPY-ist
drom esempee
Hearing Tommy laugh hurts my throat-
get this woman on the smp
it is now canon that Dream SMP group are trying to make like a film series and SAD-ist is the camera person.
Cuteooz
It’s crazy how fast you blew up, I’ve been here since what, 3k I think, and you just out of the blue went from 3k to 2.3 million, and are how old? It’s truly remarkable.
1:00 top 10 anime deaths
So dream smp is real ....... Whaaaaaa   Me left room. So they just roleplay
They all do too much breathing into the mic
That was so funny
1:04 anyone notice that Tommy only has one shoe on 😭
Sadist is a girl?!!!
Animating those moments made them 100% funnier and the art and animation style is amazing, ngl after watching you're videos, it made me want to try animation but I'd have to get better with my art, but I hope you can make more of these great animations and I hope you have a great time
Best
This honestly makes me wish that the SMP would go back to more improv and less script
SAD-ist can you do a qna? btw these animations are FIREEEEEE and oh i forgot pilipino  ka ba?
The fact that this is #2 on trending makes me so happy
I was watching this on my tv Then when I heard Wilbur say “C-“ I clicked off
One Fack Sad-ist is a filipino
what a cute voice :'D  me halfway in  tommy : MUMMMM IM LIVE
I thought sadist is a boy😢
I didn't want this video to end
The amount of times I laughed at this should be unhealthy-
okay, this is actually a compliment  but you cannot tell me sadist does not sound like BMO :(
Your - voice - is - best - English - I - hear.
Plz make one of ghoastbur coming back in the prison
Poggers this is trending
Love to see the breaking of the fourth wall in the animatic, especially seeing you in there! Makes it super fun
Thatw transition from their Minecraft character to their real life bodies is truly the perfect transition
Even when it's not an animatic I still love these
2:46  "So long Theseus"
Alt title: tommyinnit wheezing for 3 minutes
Sadist is wearing a sad dream mask but smiling in the video. WHAT IS THIS WHICH CRAFT
I also yell at my mom that I’m in a war.
I watched this video randomly. I am completely confused and do not understand any of the comments because I only very very partially understood what the video was about. I knew it was a blooper video. Therefore I knew that there was an original movie and these were the off-camera-type moments and the times when making the original when something funny happened that wasn't on the original script. That is the full extent of my understanding of this video, which in all reality is just enough to make a whole bunch of moments within it chuckle-worthy to me.
i have watched this video 5 times now
Imagine saying to your mother   “I’m in a middle of a war mother!”
Why does it say this was uploaded 10 seconds ago 😭
This is phenomenal and also you've got such a smooth voice!
pfft- All moments I have seen all moments that are so darn funny and even better animated
Also can i get a shoutout please<3
Sadist, are you Zannys gf?
1 in 1 billion chance of sad ist doing a face reveal
I have 3 questions: • Do you get paid for this? • What tablet are you using for your animations? • Whats your advice for animating:)
imma gonna buy yo yootuz
Wilbur predicting the future by speaking directly to sad-ist
YOOOOUUUUUTOOOOOOZZZZZ
Hi sad-ist
I love how most of these have tommy in it-
I live for the SAD-ist idle dances

The transition from “ill stop” to “Tom” from two diff things was lovely I loved it
Hey SAD-ist! You should make a second channel and call it GLAD-ist!
I love how you portray yourself as the film crew, its so cute and funny
i thought i was colourblind for a second when you announced your youtooz
When you see that there's no Technoblade fails: :D  Then you realize it's because he never streams: :C

Can I have the original audio of those
I love the moments when it goes from the game to reality that was hilarious
Wait. Is sadist German?
Other then the last video, I see a repeating pattern of Tommy in these
I didn’t know that they we’re actually roleplaying- ((btw I joined the fan base pretty late
Finally we get to hear hd sad-ist voice instead of webcam sad-ist on ross'es stream
My favorite part of the video was when sad-ist’s avatar showed up 😄 I never liked a sponsorship till now😆
I hope you make a part 2, I laughed my ass out early in the morning xD
SAD-IST YOUTOOZ HYPEEEEEEEEEEE
TOMMY MAKES ANIMATICS 1000% FUNNIER?
Look idk how impressive it actually is but yr trending over Olivia Rodrigo so yeah
Now i see 2 blocks on the top and the bottom reALLY MAKES A DIFFERNCE
Epic
Number 2 on trending!!
"I'm in a middle of a war mum" KSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKS
The fact that you're animating and drawing these animations using FlipClip and FINGERS fears me
She's Filipino
A black and white youtooz? I'd love that.
Everyone's talking about Tommy getting hit by lightning, but no one's talking about the lightning strikes as soon as Wilbur said "I want you to bring me back to life" 2:19
ayo who is watching this in may 2021?
i am i the only sadist fan that was on tiktok found sadist and now stan's :p
sad-ist is amazing, no cap
Why your voice is so american and not even a bit visaya accent😭😂
Carrot
"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM!!"
Imagine if they invited Saddist onto the server
"IM IN A WAR MOM"  Dedication to the cause
the little dances at the end... my heart
I WISH I COULD GET IT ;-;
I need free youtooz it’s so cute
Damn you got 2mil now shit i subbed before you had 1mil keep up the great videos
Your youtoobs comes out on my birthday^^
But... Tommy’s mom is canon. :)
Anytime Sadist posts a new video:   The internet: *SCREAM*
Whatcha know about rolling down in the deep end?  Astronaut in the ocean
funny cool
SADIST YOUTOOZ
I'm watching these while doing homework ＿φ(°-°=)
You forget when technoblade yelling at tommy "you wanna be a hero tommy" he missplaced the wither head 😂😂
Your voice is so relaxing
Noice
HAHAHA THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOOD!!!!!!
Oh, so SAD-ist is a girl? ;-; How can she animate better than meh.... I'm just making a trash animation 😑
Dude Tommy reacted to your vid
Ma'am pls your animators are SO GOOD PLS DON'T EVER STOP
*This will go down in minecraft history...*      *Of bloopers.*
SAD-ist is now a canonical phantom with a tripod and a camera that films there every move
It drops on my birthday!!
Sad-ist’s voice sounds chill in a weird way that feels relaxing
This reminds me of the bloopers Disney used to put at the end credits of their animated films
funny as hell love it
After 1 month he uploaded again lezzz gooo
Ok ok hear, me out you and most of the smp members know each other, they tell you lore before they do it and rehearse it then take the audio and make a trailer
I’m so happy
voice reveal?
POGCHAMP SAD IST
I am joining the giveaway I would love to win Bc my birthday in may 20
0:24
We need a part 2 for yes daddy dream
Does this mean were getting a tommy exile animatic?
U sound like a filipino..
"I'm in the middle of a war mom." will always be my favorite clip of Tommy.
I like how when technoblade said so long theseus tommy did not show up in the bloopers anymore
Relaxing voice ngl
Tommy's mum is so very canon.
Why do no youtooz have guns
Yesss it on trending yayay
this video makes me realize that tommy's laugh is slowly going to disintegrate his vocal chords and his entire trachea.
YOU TALK NOW U$UICMVJIMREHUXNDFRG
PLEASE I LOVE THIS SO MUCHHHH
Congrats for 2mil <3
Good video
you used undertale for your bg music :D     you are officially one of my fave youbers <3
wait a minute... bemo?
Sad-Ist just looks disappointed all the time tho
is no one gonna talk about cute little sad-ist filming in 0:35
Ahhhhhh that’s my birthday, I am truly blessed
My favorite parts are how everything looks serious then when something mess up it goes to a normal screen also I like how they get little
I was doing so well noooo
ARMPITS We bow so much to the dictates and expectations of the world, ourselves, and the devil; that we deny our own realities. Take armpits for example {hear me out 😊} as I watch sleeveless singers and athletes waving at the crowd/camera I see the “requirement” that their armpits be clean shaven. Now we all have hair there, and we all know how hard it is to gain and maintain that look. Dare to grow hair there and society has a scare. JESUS knows us inside out, past and future, highs, and lows and still He loves us so. Let this love raise you from the darkest pit.
:0
This is just a sneak peek for sad-ist's future animations.
This will be 30 bucks well spent
Love your acsent
At this point SAD-ist should get a tour on the smp or just be on it just sayin
Can someone plis tell me was is the name of the intro song?? plis !!
Tommy’s mom calling him to empty the dishwasher in the middle of an argument is one of the best bloopers ever.
1st on trending once again. wows
All this time I still didn't know that it was pronounced "Saudist".
dré
Reminds me of the old Pixar bloopers lol
OMG CONGRATS!!!!!!! I'mma buy one regardless!!! But i still hope i win one XD

#2 on trending I- Sad-ist is more popular than the actual ccs 😂 I see why tho
I love your animations so much! Would you ever consider doing any for the shady oaks smp?
_How can one simp for an animation?_
i love how much time and effort you put into this bloopers video
*Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing*
why tommy's laugh gotta be like that tho 💀
The fact that I’ve seen the actual bloopers in streams, it’s as funny if not more than actual minecraft
im surprised that none of the dsmp members are here
im surprised that none of the dsmp members are here
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Why are people obsessed with these guys
im surprised that none of the dsmp members are here
Alternate title: renowned animator with over 2 million subscribers animates people wheezing for three minutes and thirty-eight seconds.

3:11 a random comment that Ranboo’s eyes remind me of avocados
Sad-ist got Dem moves doe
would it be possible for u to make a dream SMP tv show animatic....? I think that would be really cool and u are a very talented person
May man ist why dont you join an smp
Sadist makes bloopers 1000% funnier
i'm gone for one weekend and there's a new derivikat and sad-ist
tommy and dream have the most powerful laughs im zkuyxgakudvcajhacjemyhfciwxj
2:00 ,,Im in middle of war" The funniest clip for me
sadist should just in evry important stream be in the discord aswell, so she can have more bloopers
The voice it for you?
Animated IRL tommy is so much different than animated in-game tommy.
“Let me now remind you of the Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I tell you . I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said‭. ‬For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
0:58 - 0:59 The way he said "um...are you ok?" was so innocent and cute-
IS THIS A VOICE REVEAL
I still hope you somehow manage to put in the "burning in the rain" bit
Lol
When the voice in you head discord breaks smh
What do you use to animate plzz
Also sadist, put this one in the animatic: C*M
And the Wilbur Soot outro music to bring it all together— a true masterpiece
Yessss first long Ranboo bit!!! Can’t wait to see more :))
I love hamilton
Lol
Excuse me as I spitted my water to youtooz reaction. My bad.
When Tommy laughs really hard it sounds like he's gonna cough his lungs out
You are soo good
I love how almost all of these clips are of Tommy and his wheezing.
Alternate title: Sad-ist makes Dream SMP 1000% Funnier

Dream: *dies* Tommy: *dying of laughter*
Yo I remember when I would watch the Hamilton videos😁
The sad mouth in the mask looks like a big nose
Why does SAD-ist’s voice remind me of BMO from Adventure Time it’s like oddly nastalgic
when did the ranboo thing happen i think i missed it
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM! Finally someone has animated that
It’s so cool to see how much your style has grown from the first smp video to the latest one, I can’t wait to see what you choose to do with the next one
I like your voice :D
1:52  When u have a war at three pm  But a dishwasher to clean at three thirty

I've never seen the ranboo one and oh my god thats hilarious 😂

My minecraft rabbit got struck by lightning in a sunny day . Pls don't make a viedio. I don't want to be the first fan of sad ist that gets bullied
For a second, I thought Sad-ist was drista.
I love the nail and needle in the youtooz
this video was very poggers.
SAD-ist, if you make another channel, you should name it 'HAPP-iest.'
this is so good
You sound like the little video game guy from adventure time XD (no hate)
Sadist why are you so sad
Bro if I got a box that said SAD-ist on it and my parents saw it they’d disown me 100 times
poor ranboo
Bruh her character is so unoriginal if you know what I mean but other than that, her animations ARE FIRE
Tomwheeez and Drewheez
I like how they just talk to sadist through videos and then she creates the animatics
Voice reveal
They should invite you to the smp
Not trying to be weird but I like your voice! 😃 and great job on the video
*sad dance commences*
I’m so exited for the next animation!
SAD-ist youtooz WOOO
Who else literally feels like YouTube is their best friend during Covid.
Pov: your from watching Tommy react
I love the use of that pale green color to consistently signify the real world, love the details! (Also the way you draw bow poses which are always somehow flawlessly beautiful!)
But did I ask
Literally all (except 1) of these have tommyinnit in them
sorry I just couldn't look away from the little heart-
Who did it
Yoooooooooo
You got 2 mil for animating a crappy Minecraft smp
sadist is pretty much a member of the dream smp by now
Omg I love you sad is it ok if I call you sad anyway um you did a great job you are amazing keep up the good work 🤩🤩😗❤
black bars at the top and bottom means its cannon
Why is tommy in all of them
when you realize, her youtooz drops at the same time schlatts youtooz drops
That is so good and it even has Easter eggs from your Hamilton videos
Should try to collab with Devinakat, her costum music and your animation whould be cool to see

Man motherinnt be making it more funny

Cute little sad-its are dancing
okay but can we talk about how pretty her voice is
I absolutely love the idea that Sad-ist is the camera-person

moar bloopers
someone get the original clips for me? I need em for an edit😟🤲
You have an extra $1? 🆘 Savin' to get a laptop (homejob). No opportunities outside due to constant lockdowns (unlike other countries). 😷 Sorry for this. 😢 I'm not a bad person, just a desperate breadwinner. Lost a lot since 2020.  Off-topic, I know... I hope you understand the desperation. I know some people need more help than me and my family but I do hope that does not invalidate my cry for help. 😢   Things are getting worse here. We don't have stimulus checks or anything like USA. So I'm just really doing whatever I can to put food on the table. We may not be killed by the virus but the situation is surely slowly killing us. 💔   Peace be with you. ❤ GOD bless. 🙏❤  And to anyone who's also struggling, let's hold on tight. All will soon be well. 🌞🌎🙏
I think that if sadist ever does a face reveal it should be with dream
CONGRATS ON THE YOUTOOZZZ
STOP YOU EVEN GOT THAT LITTLE LEAN BACK THAT TOMMY DOES IN HIS CHAIR 2:05
This so funny
1:22 Tommy is just- *dying*
xD The bloopers are amazing sadist and nice new figure model version of yourself!!!
#2 on trending! :D
haha yes
i subed but im too poor to buy u toos sorry
Sad finally shows the dream smp as it really is. A bunch of guys on their computers roleplaying having a blast.  Seriously though, those transitions into real life were so cool. Loved seeing Tommy's set up
Guys please be good for jesus he coming
Last
SAD-ist should join the smp but as a spectator so she can like be a birds eye view

The Youtooz even has a hamilton poster in it 😭
1:36 is legit my favorite laugh from Tommy ever
YAAAAAAAAAAAS

I noticed that Tommy is kinda the common denominator
2:46 lol
Why is this dumb shit on my recommended
bruhhhh the "so long theseus" sent me lmaoooooo
I really love this
i love the invisible screen that dream gets. very cool concept
Tommy laugh:  PPhhhhaaaaaaaa!!!
Cool and fun
The best animation was hands down dream blowing himself up
I’m surprised you didn’t do any of the times the sell out alarm goes off
i love the transition with wilbur talking about the people outside of his door and tommy’s mom yelling at him, it goes from roleplay to real life very smoothly
When you crank a really old chainsaw. 2:34
Btw ranboo is more white.
To whomever is scrolling: sending you good vibes for the rest of the day or night. Thank you for reading!
I'm just realizing Tommy's laugh sounds like a dinosaur
#%&$ dream
I want to squeeze small sad-ist
congrats on trending!!
Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today!
Hahahahahahahahhahahahahaha
Amazing very funny
Sad-ist voice sounds a bit asian which I'm familiar to cuz I'm asian
EYYYYYYYYYYYY
There could've been so many more epic moments, but, you know, bloopers
SHE SPEAKS!! And the Undertale soundtrack keeps showing up everywhere... I need to use that as my new background music...

2:30 the most beautiful frame in the world
Ok
can we agree that the wilbur soot ending music ends it all together perfectly
Dude the shift from game Wilbur to irl Wilbur was so smooth.
She has such a comforting art style
Oh I love this 😂
Lmao TNT
I dint know sadist was a girl
Bloopers SMP
Are you filipino?
ngl kinda sad the "DADDY DREAM oh wait-" from wilbur wasnt here
Sad-Ist makes Dream SMP bloopers 1000% funnier
Things I love about this: The way SAD-ist draws themselves is adorable as hell The Transition at 1:51 from in-game to irl is so smooth and i love it  The way the aspect ratio and colors change when it goes from the serious moments to the bloopers (I think i used the right words here idfk I'm a dumbass) SAD-ist's little dancey dance at the end
Yes I love this
Second name for this video: Tommyinnit makes dream smp 100000000000000000000 times funnier
Hey sad-ist, could you title the wilbur revival video "The Revival Of William Watson" since Watson is phils last name, it'd make sense <3
LETS GOOO WOOOO

1:31 i love how dream trips and takes his items
:0 Sad-ist voice reveal

Omg the ranboo was so cute
The most funny bloopers is when Tommy's mom i calling him
2:08 bro Fundy looks so weird lmaooo

I like that it feels that Sad-ist was on the actual SMP how they actually like, verbaly interact with her
theres 404 dislikes that's an error
Why have I seen this before, I'm feeling extreme amounts of Deja Vu
IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM
You sound like drista

Hi, that video is cool
I want a 10 hour loop of just dancing sad ist from the outro
Keep up the grind for real. I'm not an animator but I used to put DAYS into stick nodes projects, and rarely got anything I liked. I really respect the dedication this must take. Btw, You deserve a youtooz, keep up the good work!
1:25 **Sad- ist dying**

I haven't watched much dream smp so can someone tell me if Dream and Sadist were related because they both have a mask.
Epic
whats funny is that is mostly tommy
I LOVE THIS AWWW!!
F
🖤✍️
The outro is... Idk that made me laugh for some reason
Ranboo got animated!!!!!

Notice how most of the bloopers involves Tommy I love it so so much 😂😂😂
PLZ- I CANT STOP LAUGHING IN 23 AM PFFFTTT AHAHAHH
MUMMMMM I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER RN IM LIVE
ur animations are the best
THAT ENDING ANIMATION IS ADORABLE I CANT
The fucking chances of Tommy getting struck by lightning mid sentence tho
the one thing I hate about this channel- it doesn't have nearly enough subs
I want one but am still young am 8 oh and i subbed
Bruh moment lol.
#2 on trending nice
just looked it up  I Minecraft the probability of getting struck by lightning in a loaded chunk is 1/100,000  So Tommy just got VERY unlucky there lol
I love this
notice how almost all of these involved tommy 💀
please add Homeless dream
I WANT A YOUTOOZ
kinda sound like Drista but edited
Why does she sound like Drista...
1:30 and use the . button to go frame by frame for the best dream
Imagine yelling at your Mom that you don't empty the dishwasher, because you are in the middle of a war
Wowzers.

im living for animated tommy at his desk its so nice
Q
Yay, glad the youtooz still has hollow knight stuff
XOOTOOOZZZZ
The outro was soooooo cute
Haha so funny 😂 lol
I feel like ur ph
the greatest youtuber of all time!
I didn't even know they directly Addressed you In the first clip, holy shit! This is hilarious! And I love how you're just there- like you're the cameraperson for all these clips and stuff- it's really cool!
So my friends don’t think that I can hit 300 subs by the end of the day. Help out and prove them wrong! (Awesome vid btw!)
Well im not even surprised that we got trending at this point
Yayyyy may 21st is my birthday! Ima get the youtooz as a gift for myself!
Can we appreciate the little Sad-ist dance at the end?
I have no idea where to watch this smp but it seems cool
Wow you’ve come very high
Day 1 of trying to get famous from comments😁🥰
Filipino is so talented
SHE TALKS SHE HAS SPOKEN
I never thought the dream smp was a whole series and they knew what everyone was going to say in the lore streams My panic room” he says that so confident. If ever said that to someone it would be In my dreams
#2 ON TRENDING
Wow... I didn't know the sad-ist is in dream smp
i fucking love this so much
THAT OUTRO THO!!!
This is funny XD
Alternate title: Entire dream smp gets high on crack for 3 minutes and 38 seconds.
YES, A GIVEAWAY  YESSS, 2 MONTHS AGO
During the stream where Dream accidentally blew himself up I was just laugh crying
Ranboo:*Roleplaying so well* Dream's discord: *uhhh NOPE*
Now i know that Sad-ist actually a Girl
Behind that sad mask is hiding a true laughter    Or.... just another mask
Nice
SHE TALK, she sound filipino-
The transition at 1:52 was wild
I don't know if Sad-ist On Dream Smp & I'm Literally Confused How To Say Her Name On First Bloopers.
Now this will be a controversy But who is the best girl in Dream SMP Universe(Sad-ist included)              80% will choose Techno and the rest will be the combine of Drista, Niki, Sad-ist and the other girls
ar u filipino?
That Sad-ist animation is *chef kiss* beautiful
Fun fact: SAD-ist is atcually drista ( dreams sister)
"talking SADIST here" ah yes the formality killed me
Imagine disliking the video   Couldn’t be me
THIS IS PURE GOLD!
XD
It was totally amazing Plus can you make  DREAMS FALL animation
when you want a youtooz but you’re too broke
I love that she used dating start like bruh the alpharad vibes
IS EPIKK SHIT IS SO AWESOME
Sadist we need a face reveal you have done to much now you hit 1 million also
而誒誒元吃吃場所 這種歐洲骯贈送隨著元
Yeah her accent sounds like Asian, not sure what country she's from
3:25 Ranboo here literally sounds like Technoblade with a higher pitched voice—
THAT YOUTOOZ LOOKS SICK edit: dammit I forgot that my parents don't let me have Twitter for some reason 😔
Me first sadist is a girl😗😗 Me realize she a incredibly talented girl
That's before my birthday 🎁🎁
sadist makes mc animations 1000000% funnier
YOU NEVER MISS
If a person isn’t subscribed to Sad-ist they are not a true DSMP fan!
This is the first time I saw someone laugh after being struck by lightning
Lmao is the word of this video
Not first
This bloopers is so good 😂 i love your video ❤️❤️
You are a women!
😂 thats cute I like how your character when Talking and you have a nice voice
The way you drew Wilbur was just amazing
L    O    L
I live for animated dmsp bloopers
Its good animation but fuck dream
Sad-ist what are your pronouns? Also love the vids!
The real question is who was filming sadist filming them
sad animating herself honestly made my day
Imagine have more subs then karl
.......
lol
The fact that people with 500k - 1 million subscribers work harder than SAD-ist does with 2 million subscribers is making me want to throw up She literally doesn’t even add colors and it’s not completely animated. The fps most of the time is just 1. Or the animation is just a sliding character. Like her art style is amazing and all, but seriously, 2 million subscribers? A channel like that would normally have less than 100k subscribers.
POV: *Talking SAD-ist*
so cute
My day has been made.
* Insert sad Ranboo noises because he was doing so well *
Why are most of the scenes tommyinnit
Mwaster peice 👌
Seeing sadist suffering behind the camera makes it 100x better also btw loves when there is a moment where dream take a damage a bit by making him stumble down is much more better, keep up the good work! And please dont forget to rest
I feel like SAD-ist isn’t laughing but annoy even tho she not😂
LOL with her behind the camera and Tommy and Wilbur just HUGE!
This is so great, I would literally simp for you sad-ist!
Wait there’s bloopers
NO THOUGHTS ONLY SADIST GHOSTBUR AND RANBOO
Yayy!!!!
woah
Why didn't ma notification just ;-;
RANBOO MAIN CHARACTER MOMENT ANIMATED BY SADIST YES PLS IDC IF ITS A BLOOPER
The outro animations are so adorable!!!!
Iloveyou your vid and support you
LOL
I have the dishwasher unloading problems too lol
Love the bloopers :]
thanks for feeding us <3
The only one we missed is the yes daddy dream from Wilbur
Pwhahhahahahhhaahaahha
When u realize Sadist is a Girl

Talking Sad-ist

I love this so much
Wilbur: Tommy I want you to bring me back to life. Tommy: What...? The storm: [Strikes tommy dead] Wait bring who back to life? Oh you meant bring Wilbur back to life!—wait-oh..... so I killed Tommy for no reason whatsoever?....
SADIST WHERE IS TECHNO MESSING UP WITH THE WITHER SPAWN?!?!?!?!?!?

Why do u look so depressed
OMG SADIST YOUTOOZ
I want to see Sadists interpretation of Wilburs famous line: "If it pleases the court! I would just like to say that my Opponent is talking s H I t" 😂😂😂😂
OHHH I THINK I UNDERSTAND NOW I THINK SAD-IST SEND A MESAGE TO THE DSMP BEFORE SHE MADE THE DSMP WAR ANIMATION IMA RIGHT?
The way she draws Ghostbur. Mmm me gustaaa
#2 ON TRENDING YAYYYYY!!!
I’m surprised she didn’t do the scene where techno tells tommy that the adults were talking then he laughs and says, “that was a bit BM”
YOOOO U GETTING A YOUTOOZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ CONGRATS ALSO THIS BLOOPER MOD WAS HILARIOUS!
NOICE
i hope the next animation is from the egg arc pls sad-ist i luv your vids

_I LOVE U SADIST_
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Did sadist make a voice reveal or something?!?

tommy being struck by lightning lives rent free in my mind  edit: I just rewatched and noticed how satisfying the transitions from being in-lore to streamer is (when it turned to wilbur pointing out the ppl outside and motherinnit calling tommy)
Sadist the god of edit
I remember a good scene that could be in next one maybe. Idk who said it, I think it was Fundy... Him and Ranboo were arguing and Fundy went "Ok sir Time Traveler" 😅 who remembers it too?
Why is she so small?

OMG I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT FIRST CLIP SINCE IT HAPPENED
Nah animated ranboo lore is gonna hurt so bad bc this was just the bloopers and his distress was already hurting me👤

This whole secondary universe that's 'real' but everyone knows is fake is the weirdest things. It's literally an IRL reality TV show on YouTube. Everyone has their role, lines & pay cheque but none of the interactions are real.
Sad-ist uploads in a month Me: *The prophecy is true*
Sadist Voice is so calming:o
*➡Don’t wish it was easier..* *➡Wish you were BETTER 🏅* *➡Don’t wish for less problem* *➡Wish for more SKILLS 😎* *➡Commit yourself to perpetual learning so that you can be the best version of yourself* Have a great day guys 😎
her with the little camera- it’s so cute
MUM IM LIVE!
SADIST GOT A NORMAL MICROPHONE
Woah number 2 on trending right now sadist really is amazing
Wait what about the one where techno says "you want to be a hero Tommy? THEN DIE LIKE ONE!" and messes up one of the withers 😂
O ma god
Okay that one frame of Wilbur shouting at 0:36. Sad-ist's hair getting blown back, the little mute symbol in Wilbur's mouth, it's great. Even with the goofy little videos Sad-ist adds such great details
I like how the mask makes it look like that sadist is sad but thay are not lol
This makes me feel like Sad ist is close to Dream with the :( mask
I can’t watch this with out thinking of the reality that they’re just cubed people xD. This is how it feels when you watch them act but in reality -Minecraft music-
Its my first time hearing you
tommys laugh sound so painfull and i feel like he going to die of laughter
Talking Sad-ist my beloved
ive been waiting for this one
The pinned comment was 1 day ago but this video is 19 hours ago-
Broo Ranboo's voice acting was honestly soo good. He was stuttering like he was actually stressed. Respect.

DREAM SMP BLOOPERS MAKES THE DREAM SMP 100000% FUNNIET!

“I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM” has to be one of my favourite quotes
2:46  T e c H n O b l A d E

I love the Hamilton detail on your youtooz. And you truly pay attention to details.
(Behind the screen)
i went  like a cave man seeing free dead 10 cows when i saw sadist had uploaded a new video
I can't wait for the next animation
I'm convinced that the DSMP was created just so that Sad-Ist could animatic it
Got my youtooz collection in the next week
That tnt caught me off guard when I first watched it
People wondering how we can tell  if she’s female? Check her vegina
She’s an animator like Jaiden and she sounds like her too.  Wtf
I wish that techno being unable to spawn a wither would also be in this video
“Don’t ask questions Tommy, the adults are speaking.”
Hmm you sound like a filipino
I just realized we need a face reveal.
Talking sadist was so cute
"I'm in the middle of a war mum!"
The transition on how they really look like  IRL was amazing job well done

SAD-ist makes the Dream SMP 1000% funnier
“IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM!!!”
Sad-ist - - = Sadist
I feel like I am somehow the only one who knows that Dream admitted to summoning the first lightning that struck Tommy... like why is this not common knowledge? he said it in an alt stream I think.
Is it just me or does sadist sound like a filipino?

Poggers

Day 2 of asking SAD-ist to join the Dream SMP
I love the little hollow knight reference in the yootooz and the Hamilton one lol
nice youtooz! I'm broke af tho 😅
Xdddd what was that? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You sound like BMO
this bloopers animatic made me laugh a lot it definitely made the previous animatics 1000% better!
Poor ranboo, getting traumatized, and wasting his best attempt
i like how SAD-ist drew herself as a kid being the cameraman just filming grown adults and minors roleplaying :D
SAD-ist youtooz giveaway!  *Cries in PH*
I wonder if I’m the only one that finds it funny that the first time ranboo talks in a sad-ist animation, it’s a blooper reel
why Tommy in all bloopers....LMAO
i can't believe how SAD-ist is in a SAD-ist animatic!!!!! congratulations SAD-ist!!!! :)
I like the transiton at 1:51
This so cool
Sadist kinda sounds like drista lol,just a little bit....older???
Wow nice video congrats on the yutooz btw

IM SO EXITED I NEED UR YOUTOOZ IM SO EXITED TO BUY IT!

I now have a personal head canon that sadist is the camerawomen for the entire smp and just follows everyone with a camera
THIS IS SO FUNNY YOU'RE AMAZING
'sadist animate me shouting c*nt.... solicitors and lawyers are right outside my door right now'  'NO I CANT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR'  'THAT WASN'T IN THE SCRIPT THAT WASN'T IN THE SCRIPT'
A                                                Read more
are you filipino?
EVEYR SINGLE BLOOPER HAD TOMMY IN IT EXCEPT THE LAST ONE omg
1:15 sorry I was starting my car
YAY voice reveal
Ghostbur melting in the rain is soooo well drawn <3
I love how the most of the clips have Tommy
Sadist behind the camera shaking in disappointment
I LOVE UR VOICE SADIST
you could've added Techno actually saying So Long Theseus
Sad-ist has grown so much good luck
Ok
Dream accidentally blowing himself up was the best thing ever, I think mostly because his and Tommy’s parts together are always serious and tend to have pretty dark themes, so both of them breaking character at once was iconic 😂
Oh god this is to funny XD ALSO IT'S SO AMAZING HOLY COW I LOVE THIS! AND THE WAY YOU MAKE THE CAMERA LIKE BLUR OUT AS TOMMY JELLS TO HIS MUM! I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF FROM FREAKING OUT, HOW IS EVERYTHING YOU DO SO GOOOOD :000          SAD-ist 's animatic makes Minecraft a 1000% funnier
It's to beautiful  lol keep it up
I love your animations ❤️❤️
Google says your Filipino (You sound like one)
YOU HAVE NAILS FROM HOLLOW KNIGHT ON YOUR YOUTOOZ AHHHH THATS SO CUTE MY HEART
Mom, I can't empty the dishwashers, I'm live
PLEASE TOMMYS LAUGH MADE ME DIE EVERYTIME
I love the idea of sadist filming all of this off screen and the smp actively interacting with her xD
HI TO THE FILIPINO FANS HERE!! 🇵🇭
My soul requires more bloopers
YAY
2:01 when your in war and your mom calls you to see how your doing

1:22 Sister SAD-ist after forgetting to save an animation
Hi
I realy hope she is gone do a Domsday animation. I know that there is less stuff to work with, but i think it would turn out amazing.
Is sadist a filipino pls chat people
This was so funny and epically animated at the same time. You rock queen! :) <3

Plot twist : Sad-ist is Drista with a voice changer
poug
sad-ist i love you animatix so much

This is so streange whit not epic music
Mum! I’m live
OMG HELLO
BRO THIS IS SO WELL DONE ITS AMAZING FUNNY AND EPIC AT THE SAME TIME I CANT CONTROl MY EMTIOnS😭😭😭
It's been years and SAD-ist Is still in contact with Undertale? THAT'S JUST AWESOME
This is very funny😃😃😃😃😃
Well done as always!❤️❤️
Watching this before it reaches a million views
That outro is adorable omg
I love how the scenes have dramatic framing and look like a movie, and then as soon as the scene goes wrong the dark frame disappears or the camera pulls away over someone's shoulder, it's such a genius way of showing when we're in the scene and when we're in "real life". I also think suddenly being pulled out of the scene is hilarious so
This is epic
POGCHAMP!!
Hahahah😃😂😃
I have birthday on 23rd of may
Tommy made the 100000% time funnier
When you miss the premier
OMG, THE DANCING SADISTS AT THE END KILLED ME-   THEYRE TOO CUTE!

Plot Twist: SADist is Drista
The fact Will knew she was gonna do an animatic and their just going "hey sadist add this on the bloopers" Makes me happy that they appreciate her animations 😩
Imagine hearing your child saying "im in a middle of a war mum"

Ranboo my beloved
Right when I thought dream smp was serious  (also I will definitely try and buy the youtoo)
SHE TALKED THIS IS AMAIZING
chumy unnit
Pogville is where I currently reside because of this video
Technoblade's natural character matches so well with the script that he got no bloopers

Садист, пожалуйста, хватит напоминать мне о том, что я бомж и не смогу купить твою ютуз

Fun fact: This video has more views than any DreamSMP blooper reel
Dream exploding himself lmaoo
Thank you
Pretty cool huh? very nice!
POGGERS EVERYTHING IS CANON
okay, this is epic
Love the ending
Even the bloopers are animated so well and the ending is Poggers Amazing as always :)
so sad that my favorite blooper has not made it in. after dream blows up logstedshire and tommy is taking things apart, he digs up the christmas tree and finds the risk and promptly gets yeeted by a zombie. he has to then call dream and ask for a TP and it is v funny.
I will never forget that Sadist sounds like Jaiden Animations. This is too much i cant-
3:28 She doin her lil dancey dance
Ranboo Sad-ist moment
IM CRACKING UP normally these animations give me so many chills, I'm laughing so hard rn 🤣
I love how they see SAD-it’s as like there own personal big animator. I just kinda think it’s wholesome.
I love how sad-ist just died the whole blooper
Love it
1:31 Dream’s face plant onto his things and getting back up like nothing just happened 😂
Wow, Sadist has voice, didn't know about that  When join DreamSMP?
This is poggers-
DANCING SAD-ISTS
Tommy is the only person to laugh when he gets struck by lightning irl
You are so talented. Sheesh save some for the rest of us💖🥺
vibing sadist animations on the background. I need 'em.
imagine not following sad-ist’s twitter and therefore not knowing about the youtooz beforehand.
That intro has the most Filipino accent ever
Love it
You are sooo Good i cant believe that only one person can make movie quality animations...
MORE TALKING SADIST!!
I LOVE THIS SO MUCHHHHHH 💕💕
I love Sad-ist.
I love how dream falls to the floor trying to get his stuff 1:30
I CANT THIS WAS TOO FUNNY
AYYYEEE
SAD-ist is the godess of the Dream SMP. She is the camera man who can defy logic to give amazing shots of each scenes and will never be seen if she tries to hide.
Sadist is basically the official Dream Smp scribe
“Mum I’m in the middle of a war!!!” THE ANIMATION IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL ❤️❤️
I like the lil dance in the end
omg i cant stop laghing u did so well on the animation awsome job sadist
SADist back at with the amazing animations and finally ranboo gets a full scene and ranboo oh my go i’ve been so excited about to see any of your animatics
We want animation like hog hunt emotional,epic,funny everything
AHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Sadist is now (non-)canonically a DSMP member.
😂
I like the end part
I love most of it was just Tommy wheezing which makes 10000% funnier
THE OUTRO IS SO CUTE 😭😭
THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE SCRIPT
Just so you know, SAD-ists birthday is on May 23rd, the day the yootooz drops. So yea :]
Smol SAD-ist dancing in the end
1:51 that was pogchamp
Yoo sadist sound like a filipino???
Your ranboo is so pretty AAAAAA

I LOVE HOW YOU DRAW RANBOO PLEEEAASSEEE
I LOVE THIS OMGG
SAD-ist your voice is so relaxing hngggg
“Dang it! I was going so well!” Ranboo, that break made it even better.
I can’t explain my sadness I felt when I realized I can’t get the youtooz cause apparently paying bills and eating is important urgggg (this is a joke pls don’t take this seriously)
Lmao
WOOO RANBOO ON BLOOPERS
Shesh.
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A BLOOPER REEL NOW IS SO FUNNY   SAD-IST YOU ARE THE BEST
The little aniamtion of you at the end tho💘
YES!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE DAY SAD-IST DID BLOOPERS!

Tommy probably brings in more than both his parents yet they still treat him like a normal kid lmao
Thank you Sadist for animating the best moments of the SMP. <3
0:21 sad’s eyes went like this U_U
Woooo!! I’m glad you’re getting so much recognition!

OMG YOURE LITERALLY THE BEST😭😭
Sadist is now canonically the cameraman 👍

Sad-ist sound reveal

irl wilbur hits different

Hands down, that Ghostbur design is gorgeous.
0:50
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT I SWEAR TO GOD
Why is Ranboo so cute in this one?!?!? XD 3:26
I'm surprised that she didn't animate Technoblade messing up the wither spawns.
These are so good because it’s so short yet so breathtaking and perfect
Tommy realizing how much he just _wheezes_ at things.
I love her voice
SAD-ist you impress so much every time!! I would watch a full-on movie of just you animating the dream SMP, you do such an incredible job! Thank you for being amazing and for getting me into the DSMP in the first place with your OG animatic!
The way Tommy gets moved by the explosion at about 1:10 is really satisfying to watch 😯
Poggers Champion
3 words   So Freaking Good  You've outdone yourself again sadist!
Amazing great job :)
ah yes
I love how sadist made it nice and happy in the beginning and then serious
To
THIS IS SO COOL
Wait what

I can’t wait to buy your youtooz on my birthday lol it comes on my birthday
Didn't know your a girl!??!

next:the doomsday (l'manberg destroyed)
Ask if I live in Chile and you will come to my house elsewhere xd? sorry for bad english
Dream: *Crashes* Ranboo: Noooo I was doing so well!
THIS IS FUNNY ASF
I was so excited when I saw the youtooz but then the realization hit me since I dont have a debit/credit card and asking my parents would make them put pressure on me to get good grades and then- wait am I procrastinating. ANYWAY rip sadist youtooz, will be missed. maybe- idk.
At the start was that your voice? So cute >w<
Lets go sadtooz YO im about to waste my saving on it and try to get it on time
LOL I LOVE YOU SAD-IST! AND I LOVE THIS XDDDD
THE OUTROOO, YESS
Tommy sounds like he's dying every time he laughs.

I love the implication that sad-ist is the one filming the entirety of the dsmp lore
THE LITTLE SADISTS AT THE END ARE SO FUCKING ABORABLEEEEE
When you find out that SAD-ist is a Filipino just by hearing her accent
The ending is so cute.
"Mum, I'm in the middle of a— in a war mum!"
When Dream died that was my favorite
SADISTOOZ
Tommy: "PLEASE DO NOT ANIMATE THAT!" Sadist: "I have selective hearing"
Part two 🥺🙏
2:33 The lighting: its my time to shine

Tis a blessing
is it just me, or should SAD-ist make a dramatic animation about wilbur getting revived?
the dsmp communnity when sadist posts is like the anime community when animes make a new season
1:29 this is so cute!
Sadist low-key sound like drista👁👄👁✨
This video is so hilarious 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
THEY'RE SO CUTE THIS IS AMAZING
when dream died then i think tubbo or ranboo were spamming canon lol
Ngl i though u were a boy
SAD-ist makes Dream Smp bloopers 1000% funnier

Your Youtooz will be released during my Bday :D
Yay! Hehe!!🤣
lol
"I WAS DOING SO WELL" -Ranboo "MUM IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR"- Tommy
I was literally thinking just last night how cool it would be if you made an alt account for just random animation blerbs. And then this morning I thought of how cool it would be if you had one called SAD-istfied for behind the scene videos about how your animations are made or something, and one called SAD-istfried for the blerbs :]
3:20 HE WAS DOING SO WELL
HOLY sad-ist got a yootooz that's sick
BRO TOMMY WAS DIYING WHEN DREAM DIED TO TNT
Plz notice me ?
I just died oml this was WAY TOO FUNNY-
0:46 the way SAD-ist animated wilbur going from c!wilbur in costume, to what he looked like irl during that stream was SO impressive
Wait she has a voice no way
I like how they animated every bloopers that are remarkable like the one where Tommy got struck 😂
she is bmo
Omg look at thoose tiny dancing Sad-sts awhhhh
Hiiiii
For real, SAD-ist sounds like Drista :|
Sadist is such a talented animator like holy cow.
“Dr-dream”  *silence* gets bow WAIT NO- *dream dies*  (That was a movie, I’d watch it.)
when u want the youtooz but you cant use your credit card: sad
⌇⏁⏃⋏ ⎅⟟⋏⍜
We've been waiting for this moment
whenever tommy is in the blooper, he just dies
IM GONNA SAY IT-   CANON
The first one. One of the several reasons Wilbur got evicted.
I love ur animations
omgomgomgomgomg
I imagined u as a boy, but both is good.
I haven’t seen bloopers in awhile . It’s nice and funny to see everyone having fun while doing hard work
the ending is very amezing
Awesome
SAD-IST IS A GIRL?!
So your part of the dream smp?
Tommy laughs like he has a bad cough or tubercolosis or something
Love how they call you out somewhat on their streams to animate this, and I wish I had this type of connection to my fans/ppl who animate me/my character(s)
Now that made dream SMP a 1000 x Funnier
"MOM I CAN'T EMPTY THE DISHWASHER, MOM I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF WAR MOM!" -Theseus?
Now thatpls a Filipino accent !! Pin pls 🤣
lol
Omg! This is beautiful! XD  *"Please do not animate that!"*
You sound like a vocaloid
More SAD-ist content, just what I needed today
Sad-ist as the cameraman gives me *life*
“Do not animate that”  -tommy  “Sike” -SAD-ist
*Finally Funny Moments*
**Dream was blown up by Dream**
Aah m’y brain is exploding of happiness and laughter
I laughed so hard at this 🤣
*empty the dishwasher*
Aus it's cute at he last Animation (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
This is iconic
This is hilarious! And I love it!
Can it be canon now that SAD-ist is like a cameraman who documents the events of Dream SMP and that’s what her animations are.
i might be crazy... and it is really late... but is that a slightly different art-style i see? maybe? maybe not?? idk man but its looking' good!
this makes minecraft 10000000% funnier
Omg Ranboo animated was amazing!
THE DANCING SADS OMGG
I like how small SAD-ist is
CUTE SMOL SADIST
I feel Sad-ist is secretly Drista
Magaling ito— SAD-ist good job on getting a yootooz✨❤️💕❤️💞✨💕❤️💞❤️✨❤️✨❤️❤️💕✨💞✨❤️

XD
Petition for SAD-ist to be added to the DSMP with spectator
this is SO GOOD!!!!
I love how when dream's on script he's all sinister and calm and the second he breaks script he's this awkward mess of a human
Sad-ist makes Dream Smp 1000000% Funnier (laughing Tommy Face)
Tommy does make minecraft 1000% funnier
I like how the bloopers still have extremely high quality animation
I love the thought of the entire Dream SMP being  inside an Actor AU
“I’m in the middle of a war mum” is the best sentence I’ve heard in a while.
SAD-ist mini her dancing makes this video so much better
Sadist
I love how all but one have Tommy in it
HAHAHA
might buy one
Lol
SAD-ist is a gift that keeps on giving

Date start is the easiest and best way to advertise anything.
SADIST THIS IS SO NICE
SAD-ist is now the canon camera person of the smp
Even the bloopers are sick

Sadist the camera-woman

YESSSS HAHAHA
Tommy got re-revived :)
YESS A NEW ANIMATION💃🌠💃🌠💃💃🌠💃🌠💃🌠
29.99 usd that's 1,431 in peso....I'm poor tho🙃😪
Sad ist sounds like drista
"If it's animated, it's cannon"
Ranboo is such a good actor tho
Omg I love this soooo muuuch!! Great job SAD-ist! Can't wait for more!
The fact that Tommy just told his mom that he's in the middle of a war is just unbelievable
You need to join the dream smp
Ok but can we talk about her little dances at the end. They're so cute jwahdakjs
It's funny that sadist animated herself as a kid and dream smp members are older than her Like just a little girl directing a bunch grown ass adults😂
Yoooo,Sadist is in a Sadist animation lets gooo!
Haha tommy get struck by lightning:)
I LOVE TBE YOUTOOZZZZZ
Awesome!
*Sadist uploads a bloopers? IMPOSSIBLE*
THIS MAKES EVERYTHING SO MUCH FUNNIER
OHMYGODSHEUPLOADED

Wow just appreciate this video for a sec, it funny and all but wow the animation, keep up the good work sadist your doing amazing
Tell me I'm not the only one who audibly gasped and went back to pause and screenshot the Techno drawing, please, I can't be this down bad on my own
you animate ranboo soooo cute
I just love the raw energy that 1:29 emits
No one: My parents in the other room: 1:28
Me when Dream SMP
Good day for the Ranboo Community
1:13 Dreams ghost and tommy just stairing at his body was my favorite.
This was amazing hahaha loved it
the transitions from serious rp to blooper is so S M O O T H
I like how most of the spoilers involved Tommy
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS
This bloopers are hilarious! and the little SADs on the end of the video dancing wre so cute (≧▽≦)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What if sadist was in the dream SMP
THE DANCING SADISTS AT THE END AAAAAAA
1:50 holy this transistion is so good!!
Juat noticed Dream makes the most bloopers XD
:P
I love the transition between lines that are in context to the game vs irl, like how Wilbur goes from trench-coat and beanie to glasses and shirt in his office.
Love You Sadist And your animations I want to make an animation like you I'm trying
What if the greatest Plot twist was: SAD-ist was Drista all along?
Nice outro tho
The lightning be like: *”Jschlatt sends his regards...”*
May 21st  is my birthday yay
It’s now canon that sadist just follows everyone on the dream smp with a camera and boom mic judging everyone’s random shit talk
TF i tought she was a boy the whole time
I love the tiny sadists in the video they are so cute
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH it clearly shows the line between acting and reality and it's like an awesome behind the scenes
Dream: that wasn't in the script that wasn't in the script Tommy: wish it was 😂😂😂😂
Yoooooo
I like the way that you transition Wilbur at the start and the tommy on his desk
Can we just have a moment to thank sad-ist for making a new animation o-o
The amount of seratonin that this video brings me is astronomical.
She uploaded this at 1am Philippine time. what a legend
Wow yur voice is so cool and relaxing
Sadist's voice is so pretty :D
she sounds like BMO from adventure time. i love her
1:05 *DAYUM TOMMY IS TALL
Haha funny blooper go brrrrr
0:49 Can we talk about how young Tommy looks in this scene, like he's never looked more like a child than he does here.
THIS WAS SO GOOD IM ACTUALLY SO AMAZED ON HOW WELL YOU ANIMATE!!!!!!!
Omg sad-ist
Sadist made it cannon  *She is the camera crew.*
LMAO I REMEMBER THESE CLIPS
SADIST CONGRATS ON 2 MIL!!!! OMG
headcannon the dream smp is just a high school drama production that got out of hand and sad-ist is just the exhausted but supportive director
Tommy: *gets struck by lightning .-. *proceeds to choke
I love this i wish you couldve add YEAA GO DADDY DREAM!!

Sad-ist can smile *lies*

Dream sounds like gogy 2:54
hello
I knew this was gonna be the sound of her voice
Tommy smp
All of them tries to have a serious lore moment. Random thing happens that isn’t in the script: *I’m going to end their entire career*
you're the best
I NEVER WANTED SOMETHING ELSE THAN THIS
at: tommy dies
What about “Daddy Dream!”
Long have i wanted bloopers, and you have delivered. Thank you :)))))
sounds like drista
Can we appreciate that the fact this happend
This is an amazing video!! And its so funny XD
Sadist dancing *sadist dancing*
my god this animation bloopers are literally 1000x funnier XD
Her avatar is so cute
she even have a filipino accent
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sneek peeks?
Dream: *Blows up Tommy's chest* Also Dream: *Dies* Tommy be like: *Laughs* You have 2 lives left B*tch! XD
are you seriously bringing a needle to a nail fight that's a bit cringe
These bloopers are really something
“So long, Theseus.”
I hate how jake Paul is trending but this isnt
its the dancing sadists at the end for me
Y E S
First time i heard sad-ist's voice
Ranboo is so annoyed when Dream's discord breaks and it's hilarious.
Mmmmmm new SAD-ist animatic
Holy shit your voice is so adorable
Tommy:please do not animate that  Sad-ist:No
ranboos first sadist lore is the bloopers video. we love to see it lmaooooo
Only og's know that SAD-ist was the first person to wear the mask
the transitions from their minecraft characters to their real-life selves is the funniest thing ever oh my god
Bro these are  s o  good how do you even do this? I don’t get it. Edit: I love how the mask is so sad even when she’s dying of laughter
sad-ist has the best voice in the dream smp community
You sound a bit like drista
Hello sadist
"I was doing so wELLL- NO!" is probably one of the best DSMP blooper lines
This is so awesome but I couldn’t help but smile the whole time cuz all of their laughter is so contagious!
Plot twist: this is just the teaser of the next animation
Tommy laughs in cursive
SAD-ist bullying and getting bullied by Dream SMP members is gold
Haha funny
Sad-ist kinda sounds like Drista
I love that sadist is just DYING laughing when dream died
Cant wait to buy your youtooz :)
Why do almost all of the bloopers include tommyinnit
Laugh while you can she's making a passerine fic Animatic
Laughing rn
THE LONG AWAITED BLOOPERS REEL YESSSSSSSSSS
Dream body face planting on the ground just freaking sends me
YOOOOO YOUTOOZ btw love your voice :>
Tbh if I was also a content creator most of the bloopers would be my siblings shouting trying not to burn the house down.
We need a whole 10 minutes of smol dancing SADists that was adorable
YES NEW ANIMATION OMG THIS IS SO CLEVER AND WELL DONE AH. Also YOOTOOZ DOPE
Try not to life 30 seconds in the video already laughed
Lol, this was so funny
YEYYYY RANNBOOK AND GHOSBUR GOT A LINE IN THE ANIMATION YEYYYYY
With my Smily smp series the bloopers are just the entire thing the actual lore is just not existent anymore
That ending dance tho ( i cant spell autro)
AIIFJDSALJFSALJDI xDDDDD
PLS THIS IS SO FUNNY 😭😭
sad-ist makes animation 100000% more funnier
when the bloopers are better than the actual parts:
You sound like my friend Anjli
cool
I love this
Are you filipino? Answer pls
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YEEEAAAAAHHHH
If I’m honest this is the only youtooz I really want to win from the giveaway since my B-day is the 17th and this is such inspiration art
Oh my gosh yes
I wish I had enough money to buy the yootooz ;-;
Diganme que no soy la unica española aca porfa
Yooooo Sad-ist youtooz!
Dream killed himself  lol
The ending was sooo cute 🥰
OH MY FUCKING GOD THAT WAS HILARIOUS <3
TOM?
Add the part where techno mestup the withers
tiny sad-ist dancing will be my serotonin booster now
I wish you don't mind I download your vid 😅
Sad noices from PH.
I love this!!! ❤️😭
The "so long Theseus" with the "Tommy gets struck by lightning" was perfect
The tiny sadist at the end were poggers
Can we talk about how smooth the transition was when Wilbur's skin changed into real life Wilbur at 0:40
Wow a new animation
I really love the end screen of sadist so cute!
I love the hamilton shield thing
The art is so good
holy crap- amazing job!!!!! THIS WAS SO FUNNY OH MANN; PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE  also HOW THE HECK- WHAT HE- YOU HAVE A YOUTOOZ?!?!!?? YAAYY AND WHAT  H O W
I’ve already scheduled to get it when it drops
This brings Animation to a new level. Thank you SAD-ist
I feel so bad for Tommy's lungs whenever he laughs.
everyone is talking about the tommy zoom out but it also happens with wilbur in the first blooper, you can see C!wilbur transform into real Wilbur
The only canon Dream SMP animator.
When the Youtooz has Hornet's needle and Little Ghost's nail: 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗛𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗞𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 :𝗢𝗢𝗢
Finally Sadist animated more of herself!
Wut about the DADDY DREAM?
"I'm in the middle of a  *_W  A  R,_* mum!" "Getting drafted isn't easy, mum!"  "The food is shit here, mum!"  "I can't even start drama without getting court martialed, mum!!!"
FINALLY YOU UPLOADED A VIDEO
Are you gonna do an animation of the pet war? I know its small but it would be cool. Love you work! No pressure to do more but please i beeggggg
XD
OMG A SADIST YOUTOOZ?
That better be the end credits for a really long time, it’s so cute
so glad the dishwasher one made it in. the timing was perfect and was even the first thing Sapnap heard when he turned on Tommy's stream that day.
your character is v cute :)
I lost it at the first one, seeing tommy lose it the whole time was so good LMFAO
It's crazy how little bloopers happen when you think about the fact they are doing almost all the story live and sometimes for hours on end.
SADIST TALK'S,LEETTTSSS GOOOOO!!! omg I love your video's😚😚😚😚
SAD-ist SPEAKS!?
Question when is the next lore animatic or is there no set date?
This is awesome as always
I just realised that almost every lore blooper there is always involves tommy 📝 tommy 📝 creates 📝 bloopers 📝
Yay
Oh my god i love this so much
can u do more plzz
Done the Youtuoz Giveaway thingy :)
tommy: no not animate that sad-ist: 👩🏼‍🦯
That moment when the voice in your head loses connection:
I did not know you are a female
Alternate Title: Tommyinnit laughs for 3 minutes
this is so funny you’re so talented:D
Hi sad-ist
Dream looking at the script is the funniest thing ever LMAO
the bloopers form the most iconic clips
WE NEED MORE
YES SAD-IST I LOVE YOU
Poor camera Sadist she's working so hard 😅
AHHH THIS IS INCREDIBLY POGGERS!!!
whee whoo
om nom nom we have been feed
om nom nom
How many people do you think wonders how Sad-ist has very good animations and good "voice actors" and good storyline at the same time not knowing these are from a Minecraft roleplay started by that guy in Lovejoy
The dancing SAD-ist's at the end are all I live for /p
LMAO RANBOO ONE WHERE DREAM JOINS XD
The fact that everything gets blasted back when Wilbur screams in that first bit is great.
Better microphone quality, nice job
I'm replaying this to hear Sad-ist's voice again it's so cool
Welp time to see if I have at least $30 your youtooz is the best I’ve seen and I love it
This is actually so funny! 😂
Dreams real first two cannon lives,    "Dream, Dream, DREAM, NO MY FRIEND DONT GET RUN OVER BY A TRAIN DREAM AHHHH!"  "NO MY- **dream blew up dream using Nightmare** BAHHH!"
lmao
Good animation sadist 10/10 as usual
Tommy's wheeze is the best it sounds like he's exhaling his soul XD
Yep he animate it
we got tommy and the dishwasher by sad-ist now i can die in peace it's just beautiful
I’m definitely buying this.
This is so funny
LMAO
I cant belive sad-ist is the camer boy/girl of the dream smp
I think I just broke my throat laughing too hard
Where you got this audio? There really said that?
Never thought a blown up dream could make my day
Mum doesn’t care for war
I just realized your youtooz has a hamilton poster on it now I Love it even more! <33 But I can’t afford it 😢
smol ranboo crying is the best thing I've ever seen today
I didn't know sadist dancing is what I need
Thats the first time we got to see ranboo speak without really listening
I just realized sad-ist is a girl
I really love the little saddist oc recording everything
Wow dream died
Nice
Fun fact: The weapons on her Youtooz (how the fuck do you spell it lol) are actually the knights nail (coiled nail specifically) and hornets needle from hollow knight. Which is a throwback to her old hollow knight animations :) The minecraft block is obviously dream smp related but im not sure what the other thing is. If anyone could let me know that would be great
The youtooz is SOOO cute
THIS IS AMAZING LMAOO
I love saddists accent omg
This is amazing
XD 2:06 made me laugh
Why Is Tommy So Cute In This Video!!
What do you use to make this sadist
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE DANCING SADIST AT THE END. UNFORGIVABLE
Dude 10/10 the bit we’re dream just ✨splats✨ on the floorboard get all his stuff got me I’m crying
NEW ANIMATION AJDKWMKXKFKE
YOUTOOOZZZZ
*ghostbur asking tommy to bring back to life* God: NO
**So Long Theseus**
That new outro just reminds me of that one spider man scene with Toby Maguire
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH PLS DO MORE
My favoret blooper is when dream blew himself up, I'm glad it got animated
these bloopers be like Dream RNG just dumb luck
I would like Sadist to be in the Dream SMP cuz of recording the wars and their voices too.
RANBOOOOOO >:O
Voice reveal?
Majority of the video: Tommy Cough-dying
YES SADIST GET YOUTOOZ
Voice reveal!
Gotta love how techno’s not in the bloopers cause he has little to none
THE LITTLE DANCES AT THE END  Honestly just amazing work, scared shitless for passerine

i need your character as shimeji so i can have a tiny SAD-ist roaming around my computer screen.
His wheeze is everything even if he sounds like a dying parrot ☺️👏

I can't WAIT until all the Dream smp members react to this 😃
I love how you are inside some of these.

Ey

@lil tub bubble
Little SAD-ist dacing in the end was adorable
I like the little Sadist dances

Sadist reveals she is drista
Dream trying to be the villian, accidentally killing himself 👁 👄 👁
Bloop

the animator has a body and a voice now! SHE"LL TAKE OVER THE WORLD edit: she got an out too...
Holy shit this caught me off guard
SAD-ist just denied all requests to not animate the bloopers and that’s hilarious
Take a moment to appreciate the little Dancing Animations at the end- like oml Adorable
when is sad-ist gonna enter the smp.
Girl You really are impressive💙
Algroryhtn
Amazing
The height difference between Sadist's avatar, Tommy and Wilbur is extremely adorable
Fr though, the ending clips with Sad-ist dancing is really cute
SAD-ist I love your animations. ngl their just like movie trailers
1:40 & 2:46 & 3:28 We have to appreciate those transition scenes
I'm literally in the Truman Show at this point. I watched bloopers last night.
I WAS AWAKE SIX HOURS AGO AND I DIDNT SEE THIS >:((
Ayo you sound Filipino for some reason.
You should make an exile animation
MOREEE OF THIS!!! YOUR AMAZING <3
I love this with passion
LOL
POGGERS!! :O
This.... this is aMAZING *WHAT THE HELL.* SAD-IST YOU AREN’T ALLOWED TO DO THIS. Wh- WHY.  *why are you so good. That’s... that’s not allowed...*
That's when my book reports due...

This is great.
WOOOOO
THEY BETTER BE PAYING U BECAUSE THIS SHIT IS GODLY!!!!
What
SADIST HAS GIFTED US CONTENT!!!!! :D
sadisttttt!
ms- sad-ist, is that your actual height compared to the mcyts- 😟
Allo
Watching SAD-ist's little character dance around in the cutscene proves my point that they really need a hug :(
"Never beg someone to stay, because to beg is water." -Random post on Facebook
Bruh that transition from Tommy in game to Tommy sitting at the computer was the coolest thing I’ve seen animated ever. I’m impressed easily-
IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM as i was saying
It’s so so smooth, I love your style so much
Dancing mini Sad-ists makes me happy
Once again, another masterpiece! Love it! And congrats on the Youtooz!
If sadist like this comment i will do a backflip
Me just trying to dance with the little SADists at the outro-
3:29 she be grooving
We need more
Beautiful art work, even in the out the lore lol.
I was hoping for the ‘YEAH DADDY DREAM! oh WAI-‘ blooper would be in there lmao- But hey the ‘IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM!’ Is in there! Also very poggers animation as always Sadist
TALKING SAD-IST
I love Ranboo's design!!
YOU ARE MY FAVORITE-
This was funny and amazing :D
pls do more Bloopers
Good work keep it up
Fantastic Job!!!
so good
THIS W@s SKOOOo CUTEEE
AWAWAWWAWAWAWWWWWWW THE YOUTOOZ IS SOOOOOUPERR CUTEEEE 🥺🥺🥺🥺
*pats da sad-ist* this is cool :D
tommy getting struck by lightning was really unexpected
I’m in love with Ghostbur’s Design
so cool!!!
I wish I could get the yootoz but I'm poor 👄👁️👄
Half of them sound like they are dying when they laugh xD
You have to remember that they do all of this in one take. It’s all live and has amassed such a large audience when a lot is improv and is entirely live. It’s just fantastic, and the community grown from it is very well deserved.
"IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM!!"
we need more bloopers like this :D
wait the little dancing sad-ists in the end screen are so cute!!!
Your YOUTOOZ is dropping on my birthday!
Wait did SAD-ist just animate Ranboo-
That like like to dislike ratio is insane
SHE HAS 2 MIL SUBSSSSSSSSSSSS ? ? ? ? ? ?
I like how almost all of them involve Tommy xD
Bão de mais
Can’t wait of the next
Love all yo animations
Wait, animators can speak!?
All of these bloopers were my favorite, I'm glad to see them all animated lol
Okay the outro was the best thing I've ever seen I love it
So... What I imagine is it's like this: Those who's recording are animators that're going to animate the scene. And us watching it live is like a tv show audience, watching it raw with the funny parts in it. That's poggers.
TINY SADISTS YEEEE
I   N E E D E D   T H I S
Ok
TAHNK YOU
it's funny how tommy is in the first 3
I needed this break from all the angst i watch and read. Tyvm SAD-ist <3
One down, one to go...
So they actually voice act for it? I did always wonder how you prevented most of the sound effects in the game.
I’m so excited for the sad-ist youtooz!! You seriously deserve it!
notice how tommy was in literally 98% of the bloopers lmaoo
O H N O
Sadist can talk?
I love the end screen you added of you dancing  (it's cute the way you draw  your OC)
2:43 the Minecraft gods said no
Me waiting at the end for the ad to play to support our queen🤝
Love the dancing Sad-ist at the end
1:45 "MUM IM LIVE. NO I CANT DO THE DISHES MUM. IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MUM.
this is the video i didn't know i wanted
Why does these being animated make them so much funnier?!?!
Youtooz!!
Bruhhhh
1:13 Ngl but i laughed along side of them in that Scene, i was so serious and focus of the Lore, i forgot they were Roleplay lol
I love transitions from the avatar to real life Its just so 👌
P e r f e c t
anyone else not know that sadist was female?
May 21st is my birthday omg yes
Nearly every blooper has tommy In it Honestly I'm not surprised 😂

What’s the outro song
you’ve done it again ayup
If someone doesn’t media share this is Tommy, Wilbur, Ranboo, etc..
Ok diz Getting sus u sound like Drista🤨
I love how every Dream smp animation starts with wilbur. Even if its the bloopers
i absolutely adore this
SAD-ist Youtooz? Don’t mind if I dooz
It is so funny that SAD-Ist is filming this with her camera inside the animatic LOL
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO I SAW YOUR FIGURE BUT I CANT GET IT :(
The dancing sad-ists at the end give me serotonin
I love the transitions form the game to real life like with Wilbur
:0 the dance at the end
Everyone be talking about the dsmp bloopers  While me who is just admiring the cute little SAD-ist drawings in the beginning and end..
the one where dream blew himself up made me die of laughter lmao
GORGEOUS
I thought sad-ist was a boybtw thanks for the voice reveal
that outro was nice
Perfect!
I love that sadist is just the lil camera person filming it all
I like how Dream just has a floating script 😂
these are so funny
Yo this is so cool. I love the ones that jerk into reality so much!
Tommy’s mom asking him to empty out the dishwasher was so funny
Sad-ist is secretly the cameraman of the smp. It’s canon y’all 👀
every sadist animation is amazing
Lmao that was hilarious
wait....Sad-ist is a girl ?!?
Ranboo acting  Discord Imma ruin this mans whole career

"So Long Theseus"     2:45    -Sun Tzu Art of War
May 21st that's almost my birthday Is may 22
It being released on my birthday. ◡̈⋆ⓎⒶⓎ!(*´∇`)ﾉ
Lol
"I can't empty the dishwasher, I'm live!  I-I'm-uh-I'm in the middle of a WAR, mum!"  f*cking christ
Sad-ist: **filming the things**  My brain: I now headcanon that Sad-ist is another entity on the SMP that documents everything that happens. Non-Canonical 2nd god of the SMP.   And it is now another headcanon of mine.
Yes.
1:30 aw i loved this part where dream stumbles into screen and picks up his stuff its so good
SAD-ist dancing at the end was so adorable xd
I KNEW THE LIGHTING BLOOPER WAS GOING TO BE IN THIS
Tommy Is at the brink of actually dying/choking to death from laughter from that lightning strike...
sad-ist animator girl but cool animation.i love you sad-ist!
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW DREAM FALLS ON HIS FACE AT 1:31 WHEN THERE IS A FALL DAMAGE SOUND HGAGHAGHAGHGHAGHA
is it weird that SAD-ist sounds kinda like Drista?
BRO THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MINECRAFT AND IRL GIVES ME SEROTONIN
:D!!
Sadist I have a question. Will you be doing a full animation of everything that has happened in the DreamSMP? Like from the very beginning to now? Because if so that would be amazing!😁
Dude ur work is amazing I love it so much
This is so cute
I don’t know what I like better. The super awesome cinematic type animations do the very funny blooper video that is animated in the very cool cinematic way.
Niceeee
U HAD TO DROP THE YOUTOOZ WAY AFTER MY BDAY 😭✌️ /j
This is art
OMG WAIT THIS IS AMAZING AWWWWW
YOOOOO WAKE UP SADIST UPLOADED
i like to think that SAD-ist is like the big boss director and behind the camera the whole thing
Tommy’s design changed a bit, I love it
Can't wait for the next DSMP Animatic!!
Tommy laughing sounds like he’s dying
Yeah I’m proud of u
LMFAOOA
For some reason, your persona looks a female version of Zacharie from the Game Off. I’m sorry.
this is great- great. all great. and fOR BLOOPERS?! this is swag
I thougt sad-ist took the things they say from the clips but they dont i think thats cool
eek
In the actual animatic, the part where Wilbur said c** could have been used to say "COME" and he could have done a hand gesture signalling to come.
So her name is SAD-ist  I’m trying to comprehend that she sounds really nice but she called SAD-ist???
2:17. I know this is for the laughs, but the Sad-ist avatar is a little poofball so cute lmao
why am I getting Ruby Gloom vibes from SAD-ist? Loved the vid!
RANBOO CONTENT YAYYYYYY
on next bloopers vid: include the one with Techno's laptop popping off
ITS SOOOOO CUUUTTTEEEE!!! 💗💗💗
"don't animate this" the eyes on her mask moved. That made it look so good.
this is just wow great
:O
best bloopers I've ever seen my whole fugging life
This is a masterpiece.
Poor ranboo he was doing so well XD
At this point, they should really hire her to animated the dsmp
Soo this is the bloopers war and the animators and directors say CUT Makeup times  Fundy:hey tommy spell *icup* Tommy:*I see you p* Fundy:WHAT YOU SEE ME P YOUR SO DISGUSTING YOUR SO GROSS Director: OK let's on set in 3 2 1 go Tommy:*laught*
Sadist voice reveal ? Omg e p I c

sad-ist as the cameraperson gives me life
Your youtooz is dropping on my birthday lol
HOW DID I NOT GET A FUCKING NOTIFICATION YOUTUBE!!! XPLAINE
This is gold✨✨
If gender is a performance, I'm all the bloopers in this video.
Excellent! This would make a great series! Or maybe a Funny Moments Compilation animated?
Your voice reminds me of BMO from Adventure Time. It really nice.
You have a youtuze...
Nice
1:11 I love how he’s in character then just 😐
I like your accent if it is your real voice ;o;
*sees intro* ah, a fellow Alpharad and/or Undertale fan. I see you are a woman of culture
that tommy's mom transition tho😳
the switch from c!wilbur to real wilbur in his office is so good
Ranboo is so cute OMGG
Tommy’s hard wheezes are the best

I love sadist beeing the one behind the set there😂

The outro is so cute
Who voices these?
love that outro
I think the last blooper is one of my favorites
I love how strong Tommy’s laugh is— the intensity, the wheeze, the PHLEGM coming with it. Ain’t nobody laugh like Tommy laughs. xD
YESSSSSS A YOUTOOZ I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONGGGGG
The ending seems like something that would happen to me😂 either Dream’s or Ranboo’s side
This is hilarious. Great job Sad-ist!! Good choice on doing the funny one first
I like how they say sad-ist like your recordings tv show
4 hrs ago
I love how there's the nails from hollow knight in your youtooz. I can't believe how much progress you did since and how much your community grew up.  I love your animations and can't wait to see more. Thank you for everything you did
At around  1:35 you can see a braid in Tommy’s hair. Is that an sbi thing? Or what?
Everytime real life happens I love how you just zoom out show them from their angle and what they really are doing.
YEEEEES!  © dream
I’m laughing
OMG you made my day
danceing danceing cutecute
Tommy: *gets struck by lightning* The lightning that struck him: *and I took that personally*
I like how your character is just greyscale, I haven’t seen a creator make themself greyscale besides you
0:37 SAD-IST'S SO SHORT
I NEED ONE OF THOES YOUTOOZ
The little Sad-ists at the end are so cute!
When my day is going shifty, I know SAD-ist got me 💪
Yes
HEY HEY HEY ILY

I love how half of the viewers liked. HALF OF THEM THIS IS SO COOL
Dancing Sad-it at best part
Tommy' s mother telling him to do things while he's live is relatable 😐
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying-
This gives me the same vibes as when Pixar used to animate bloopers 😂

will forever be a fan of sadists animations
I NEED TO WIN THIS ITS SO BOOTIFUL :DDDDD

This is rather poggers, also sadist looks really cool in the animation. Its like the unhappy female floating version of dream.
Pfffft- hilarious 👌
a treat as always
You deserve a youtooz so much also that blooper when tommy gets struck by lightining i was watching it live and omfg it was so funny xD
LMAOOOOOOOO
I love how SAD-ist is not sad, but always looks completely dismayed at the cast's shenanigans due to the mask.
if disney ever buys the plot for the smp, they HAVE to let sadist animate the entire thing, or it will never be as good
They should just add you to the dream smp
:0
Yessss you deserve having a YouTooz :D
Alternate Title: The Child Is Just Laughing And Dying
I think we need more talking SAD-ist.
It’ll be alright on the SMP.
This whole video is pure gold

A surprise for sure, but a welcome one!
oomgomogomoggmogmgmogmogmgoomgomgomgomgomgmo
I like to imagine when they do their scripts and stuff, they’re like “bro what if sadist  animates this it’s gotta be good”
I love seeing these classic bloopers in this style. It makes em feel so much more real.   And the aspect ratio shit gets me every time. I love it.
The transitions from serious to funny I’m-
this is canon now L wilbur soot
LES GO YOUTOOZ
WHHY NOONE IS COMMENTING ON THE OUTRO WHY ITS SO CUTE
2:55 I’m not crazy right?  That sounds SO MUCH like george
Did you know that when tommy and ghostbur were talking Dream confirmed that he actually struck Tommy with the lightning. 😂
Can I have like?
Gotta love when it shows them IRL pfff
YOO i love these transitions to the real world wtfff
Talking SAD-ist.   Talking SAD-ist.

“Ofcourse my discord chooses to break at this second” I died from laughter

I love the transitions btwn real life and the rp:)
DANCING SADIST

Hoooly crap this is the funniest thing I’ve seen from sad-ist. Instant serotonin.
This is what Hollywood-like behind the scenes
Funny
why do you sound like drista
I love this so much
TALKING SAD-IST :000
"I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR MOM"
Yo the actually said your name
Okay but the thought of SAD-ist being the one filming them is gold
Pls animate the scene when Ghostbur get revived!
Noice

Sad-ist voice reveal wow
Ramboo looks so cute in your style <:D
THANK YOU SADIST 🥰🥰🥰
I love it so much LMAOOO
I literally created a playlist only for your videos. I love them. =) Good job!
😭 SADIST BEING THE ONE TO FILM ALL OF THIS IS SO  ADORABLE
I love the concept of Sad recording everything
“I’m in the middle of a WAR mum!”  I’m so happy this was animated.
Love the ending
this video in a nutshell: its tommy but in need of air
This is so good omg I love it
I love how she differences the blooper ones from the canon ones with the background color. It’s simple and it does the trick!
All of these clips are brought to you by Tommy's wheezing
2:22 BRUH HE LOOKS LIKE THAT TOKYO GHOUL MEME I-
THIS VIDEO WAS AMAZING 🤣😂
The reason why Tommy's in almost all of them is because he's the funniest.
F
1:31 That freaked out stance tho XD
Here before all the famous youtubers
AHHH i loved this!!!!
I love the little headcanon that SAD-ist just films everything and is basically the producer for Dream-SMP
Yo the like to dislike ratio on this video is INSANE. This is amazing Sadist
So many of these didn’t really feel like “bloopers” when they happened,  it Sad-ist just makes this dumb Minecraft roleplay feel so serious these goofs are so out of place
NOICE
THIS IS SO FUNNY AHAHAHAH Edit: I love the little sadists dancing at the end, they're adorable!
PELSR
Ok but, ghostbur in Sad-ist art style looks so pretty omfg

"Please do not animate that" - an animated version of tommy
Oh the little bit at the end was adorable! Tiny Sad-ists :3
Your oc is Dream but sad
I was wondering when you would do something like this
LITTLE SAD-IST IS ADORABLE
Sad
Me: *draws for months*   “I’m getting better!”  *me sees SAD-ist’s Art literally 2 minutes later*  “Time to practice!”
LMFAOOO
This is amazing, I have been waiting for you to animate this!
This is one of those  “Something that we didn’t know we needed” moments
Lol, in almost all of them Tommy is included!
⟟ LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Tommy: do not animate that Sadist: it’s free real estate
Tommy: Do not animate this! All artists in this fandom: Well yes but actually no <3
MUM I CANT PUT AWAY THE DISHES
I’m in love with the way you cut between the characters and them irl
The Mystic Messenger music at the end tho XD
I love your yootoozzz, But I'm too poor.
This is way to good xD
Sadists drawn character looks cute
0:35 It's censored but she DID technically include that part of the stream in the bloopers  Just saying.
Vikkstar is gonna be proud of you sadist
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED
Here before 1 million views!
*added to liked videos*
1:32 I love how Dream just faceplants before picking up his stuff xD And also can I just say that I really like the way you draw Tommy's hair? It just looks so fluffy!
God I didnt realize your accent was that strong Sad-ist, I think its pretty cool tho!
OMFG SHES GETTJNG A YOOTOOZ! ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
Hi i am your biggest fan also I love your desings
not @ how it’s almost all abt tommy😭
I think what they should do is allow her or someone else from the animation community have access to the voice channels, so they can capture the audio seperately so people don't have to work around stream sounds or ingame sounds
cute asf 3:29
I love this so much, and those little dance animations at the end are so cute
Sad-ist my beloved
SAD-ist: (Uploads a DSMP Trailer) Audience: We'll have to wait like 3 months for the next one, but it'll be worth it! SAD-ist: _All according to keikaku._ (Releases an additional video one month later.) Audience: :O *...this is the best timeline :')*  (Ok, but seriously, nowadays SAD-ist uploads trailers on a 3-month schedule, which is plenty of time for more lore to accumulate for future trailers. And after she did _The Fall_ , she started uploading videos one month after the trailers of other stuff she's worked on, like this blooper. It's honestly incredible the amount of work she's put into this. Hats off to you SAD-ist, hats off to you. See you again around July!)
I’m early!!
Do doomsday vid
OH MY GOD WHAG WHEN DKD TJIS COME OUT HOW DID I JJST SEE THIS
lol
The techno misplacing the skulls souldve been amazing but that waas still so great

Sad-ist how did you learn to animated so well and cool???
3 hours upload per usual
1:51 AMAZING. LITERALLY AMAZING YOU- 😭😭😭😭😭
I wanted technoblade yelling at sapnap for shooting him during the tommy fight ."sapnap ! Get out of here we're having a moment go back to never uploading anything for any reason whatsoever!
WOAHH
“do not animate that”   *famous last words*
You never cease to meet our expectations SAD-ist, but you always manage to exceed them. Great job!!!
I love this. My favorite clip is ranboo, because things went so wrong he ended up breaking character.
1:31 s m o o t h
:O less gooo was here early ^^
Awesome animation as always, but I gotta say, the little dancing SAD-ists at the end were my favorite.
Ghostbur and Tommy: having an emotional moment the lightning: haha haha drykst grr haha hey there big man

Why you sound like drista
This is so great not even gonna lie i loved every second of this
UIKSJAWDHUIJWADWALJ YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES SHE HAS BLESSED US ALL ONCE AGAIN
"Im in a middle of a war mummy!" -Tommyinnit   The art of excuses
Dream blowing himself up was genuinely one of the funniest unscripted moments to me
1:51 this is very relatable, but instead of "being live" I'm "in a competitive game"
1:15 that was insane 😂👌
Outro song?
Tommy...the god of bloopers. He is in all of them.
YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
ok, so everyone talks about dreams iconic wheeze, but what about tommys?
I love telling people how Dream was the one who struck Tommy with the lighting in that one clip because he thought it would be funny to interrupt the lore
I love your voice!
The Dream Smp folks take you for granted. Don't feel pressured to do this for the rest of your life, you have old and new fans who will support whatever decision you make, and will happily watch whatever you create.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH SAD-IST HAS BLESSED US AGAIN
YESSSS
I LOVE YOU
THIS IS AMAZING- **AAAAA**

1:05  When everyone know how tall tommy is but didnt expect that long legs xD
2:46 AWWW LITTLE TECHNO
"I'm in the middle of a war mum!" That would be such a weird thing your child would say
THE TRANSITIONS FROM MINECRAFT TO REAL LIFE THOUGH IS FLAWLESS (especially during the Tommy Tubbo scene at 1:54 when Motherinnit was asking him to empty the dishwasher)
This is halairious.
MAY 21 IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Anyone else simping over SAD-ist's Voice-?
*clears throat* Fun fact!: Everything Sadist animates is canon, true in the simplest of forms.  These are all part of the plot. Thank you for listening to my Ted-Talk.
The added hotel hideaway sad-Ist at the end-
The Minecraft to real life scene transitions are smooth AAAAAA
All these moments, I can't, I can't... XDD

I will be coming back to this video every few weeks I’m afraid..
LETS GOOOOOO
Tommy laughs like he’s been smoking for 85 years.
sadist is the canonical camere person and that is sticking until someone proves otherwise.
This is what we all knew we needed but never had. We have it now. Thank you Sad-IST, for blessing us with this gift.
AHHH love this! Really helps with the seriousness
This is amazing
:D
Sadist is cannon

Sad-ist's dance at the end ,I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!

sadist is really out here feeding us
SADIST YOU ARE AMAZING
Sad-ist’s avatar was just in absolute *pain* this entire time
Your work is amazing, I loved this videos Xd
SAD-Ist brings me genuine happiness.
bloop bloop bloop goes the reel
YOOOOO RANBOO MY BELOVED
When the cute sad-ist animation: At the end of the video
When Sad-ist uploads and you don't know it because somehow you're not subbed~ Great job on this one, now it's time for me to go beg my parents to let me spend money.
Time to beg for a sadist youtooz :'')
0:24 just a personal start-of-the-animation button
Ranboo got his screen time now. Hes gonna be happi
I love that ranboos first line in an animatic is the bloopers real
"I'M IN A WAR MOM!"
THIS IS SOOO GOOD AND FUNNY!!!! 💀💀
<3
lil sad-ists dancing uwu
haha funny
epic
The little Sads at the end is just- *aw*
HAHA THE SO LONG THESEUS WHEN TECHNO SAID IT IN CHAT

Don't jumpscare me like that! I was not expecting a voice XD
AHHHHH IM IN LOVE

"So long Theseus" LMAOOOOO
Amazing video, it was so funny.
THE GHOSTBUR DESIGN THO
Wonder if I'm gonna see "YES DADDY DREAM" in here
1:23 is my fav part👍🏼
this is so well animated and hilarious
The 2nd one is funny
depression
i should be sleeping its 3am why am i awake
I love everything about this
Dang you should’ve put Ranboo stalling that was the best part XD  Anyways this is so great.  One of my favorite bloopers is when Sam  was saving Hannah  and the egg killed him. Chat had no idea for a good minute if that was meant to happen until he started laughing and said that that wasn’t meant to happen and then at the end of the stream he said “it’s not a Sam stream if it’s not a little scuffed”
3:28 So is nobody gonna talk about how smooth the tiny SAD-ist are.
LET'S GOOOO
She’s a legend
this is freaking brilliant!!  XD
I saw this before it was amazing
Ah yes
Nice job 👍🏼

THE WAY YOU DRAW RANBOO AAA
AW NOW I IMAGINE SAD-ist JUST BEING THIS CAMERAMAN GHOST FILMING PPL AND EVEN THO SHE ISNT THERE THERE’LL BE THIS CAMERA FLOATING AROUND HENCE THE STREAMS IRL-
Ya finally got a Youtooz!? I'm proud! Now lets see Sad-ist get actually added to the SMP and become Dream's old friend or somethin cool and plot-twist-esque like that
I like this
Yes.
everyone is talking about how good the animation is but no one is talking about the dancing sad-ist's at the end
So good!!! And the little Sadist dancing away are so cute ❤️
I loved every bit of this, So excellent 👌🏽 Never stop creating and being so goddamn expressive with your art
Lmaoo
That is awesome, I love how Wilbur switch out of character this quick it's hilarious
I looked on the youtooz website and saw you had one so I knew you would be forced to upload to promote it. I love that my life has come to that.
YOOOO THIS IS SO COOL YOURE ART STYLE IS SO SIIIIIICK
2:25 Tommy’s new fit here makes him look so much more mature, makes sense given that Doomsday is literally after exile.

Everytime they go out of script... Everyone in the Dream SMP: Please dont add that Sadist.
can we talk about how at  0:43 when it switched from minecraft Wilbur to irl Wilber , i thought that was cool
I love how it's like SAD-ist is filming all the smp lore and the whole smp acknowledges it
"Im in the middle of a WaR mum" XD
its almost always tommy
YES SADIST.
Shes a genius no cap
Your part of Dream smp .o.
Huh so that’s your voice
i'm in the WAR, mom!
Fact: *you clicked on this faster then ever before.*
Why she didn't put there a scene where Technoblade and Tommy met Dream on L'Manberg? It's just ideal scene for there
I just realised SADists youtooz drops on the same day that Miitopia’s full release comes out.
can we just say how good she did with the hair at the end?
I FORGOT ABOUT DREAM BLOWING HIMSELF UP IN LOGSTEDSHIRE
I’m so tempted to buy one honestly
Heyo ma peeps :3☺️
2:46 the “so long Theseus” made me laugh
This is sad
I’ve watched this so many times and I keep wheezing at it 😭

*sigh* I love ranboo animated
I have no oxygen....
*I love everything about this*
sad-ist saying she's in a sad-ist animatic is for some reason rlly cute. good work sad-ist!!!
This was freaking hilarious 😂😂 Totally lost it at dream dying to his own tnt 😂😂😂
I love how 4/5 of these bloopers have tommy in them
Bloopers animations :D
I like how Tommy is in most of them
"I want you to bring me back to life" KABOOM
This was great! 😂
That was so cute!!! I loved it! Also your animations are getting so clean and it’s just chef’s kiss
EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU SADIST
SAD-ist you are the best director and animator ever. Really loved this. Hope you visit the DSMP as a guest someday.
Yes, this very good

2:46 glad to see Techno in here
SADIST VOICE IS SO PRETTY
Hellooo!!
LMAO
Yes
I can't be the only one who loves these animations 3:28
Even the bloopers are epic when sadist makes them xD
Tommy’s mom is the most cannon character on the Dream SMP.
Love the little dancy sad-ist at the end :]
Ok but the little sadists at the end of the video are just SO CUTE
this is poggers and you cant disagree
Tommy: “do not animate that”  SAD-ist: “I shall animate that :)”
Sadist got some smooth transitions
One word: EPIC
The little sad-ist in the outro!! They are so C  U  T  E!!!

A BLESSING FROM THE LORD.
THE INTRO IS MAKING ME CRY YOUR VOICE IS ALOT MORE CONFIDENT  WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU, YOU'RE DOING AMAZING
Sadist made it funny and beautiful at the same time. Two things I am not. That’s talent-
"DATING, START!!!" "......" "...Youtooz Start?"
*tea kettle wheeze intensifies*
Thank you for the time and effort once more. It was beautiful <3
Ranboo was doing so good, holy crap
Oh my gosh I was laughing so hard XDDDDD Thank you Sad-ist for the laughs!
Imagine Sadist is a shape shifting reporter on the smp. She turns into block and animals to watch all the tea then reports it all back to the people outside the dsmp country. (Aka the viewers)
Thank you sad-ist, you made Wilbur proud 🥲
Beautiful
All these moments bring back memories to the start of the SMP
THIS IS SO GOOD
Can i have a youtozz?
You got to admire that she did like a Charlie Brown themed intro for this.
Hey sadist  Who do you like the most in Dream smp
May 21 is my birthday :D
AMAZING I LOVE IT
SAd-ist i beg you from the bottom of my heart please make a techno-chan animation
:0
0:35 "You are going to serve- Wilbur: C○CK

Love the outdo btw
i love this omggg
The Dream respawning animation is so cool
Too! Funny! You forget that some of these things happened and now it’s animated?! HA!
Headcanon that Sadist is a reporter who broadcasts what happens on the dsmp for those out of the “country” (aka the viewers)
You’re literally the best 😆
This is amazing omg
Ranboo would be happy that he is mainly focus on one scene
THIS IS SOOOOOO FUNNY💀😂
Omg if i was can buy this yootuze i was not thing twice and buy it
no :)
I was doing so well! NOOO-
Didn't get a notification   *"My Disappointment Is Immeasurable And My Day Is Ruined"*
Omg I love the Hamilton picture since that’s what you first started posting on YouTube :) (lovely throwback)
YOUR VOIICE IS SO CUTE:'DDD
The next one should have Techno misplacing the wither skull
Oml this is so good XD
Love your edits watched it a thousand times but it still never get old for me thanks so much and congrats on your youtooz
My biggest flex is that I commented on a SAD-ist video before any of the dsmp members without notifs on
Yes
Шикарно !
lol
You are the best<3
as always just extremely amazing! I love your animations sm and you've inspired me to try animation aswell! :D

Honestly I’m so incredibly happy that you’re getting a Youtooz! Good job man!!
I’m getting a Youtooz if I have to die of social anxiety so be it. A price to pay for the figure of my favorite animator
I watch your videos all day, like all day reapiting them And even like that they didn't notif me
I can’t wait for them to react to this
Woah I want sadist youtooz
Why her voice like drista

*sad-ist - :(* ''don't be sad, have some bread... no, im serious. TAKE IT.''
amazing but I’m heartbroken at the lack of YEAHHHHHH DADDY DREAM
.
i’m in love with you
Tommy: "don't animate this!!" Sadist: "I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move"
Is it a coincedence most of these bloopers involve Tommy?
.
It really should be something good to be known and loved by the youtubers you most like to watch
Yooo that was cool are you gonna do an animation with alivebur soon miss?
"Okay, now SAD-ist, also put this one in... C***!!!!" I'm almost certain I was there on Stream, but I had no idea he said this...  Also, this was the best thing. I'm so glad you did this.
LMAOOO
U should do more vids like this its great
AW I LOVE THIS
*I-*
Only main character not on the SMP. Confirmed canonically
1:14 2:02 2:31 3:14 I found these funny
This is amazing ily omg Also, I love how Tommy and Tubbo look slightly younger but still mature (or as mature as those two get lol)
In that dishwasher one Tommy literally said don't animate to exactly Sadist and I was waiting for her to animate it lmao
<3
Aaaww!! I love the little SAD-ist's dancing at the end <3

I live for your art (but especially for your Ranboo design ITS FUCKING ADORABLE)
Mini TommyInnit falling on his face is the most hilarious and yet adorable thing i have ever seen 1:28

If I had a nickel for every time Tommy got struck by lightning I would have 2 nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice

Tommy: don’t animate this   Sadist: no :)
I like how pretty much all of this included tommy lol

A Shadowed Head Roblox UGC approves this video. Also A Shadowed Head Roblox UGC approves the Youtooz. Also A Shadowed Head Roblox UGC approves the bloopers.

Fun fact: Dream actually summoned the lightning from the one where Tommy got electrocuted. He was watching the stream, and thought it would be funny

Okay, but those transitions to irl are 😌👌
yoo! this was so good!
I start laughing so fucking loud and everyone was like: what's up with her
WOOOOO TGHIS IS AWEDSOME
I like how you can see the way the bloopers go from cinematic for it being serious and then the borders go away because that wasn't supposed to happen.
I love how you made it switch when they were talking about real life 😂
Bruuuuuuuuuuuh your yotuz is on the same on my lil bro  birthday
This is just a masterpiece
Idk why but i want to see sad-ist in the dream smp or maybe even in the origin smp

This is the best thing ever, don’t you dare argue, now I’m off to animate this as well... it’s not stealing right?     Don’t worry I’m not gonna steal the art lmao, my incompetent but is probably just gonna steal the audio... it’s not plagiarism right?
Here before Tommy innit
DAMMM I LOVE HOW WILBUR AND TOMMY HAD THESE MOMENTS OF IT GOING FROM THEIR CHARACTER TO THEIR ACTUAL SELF DAMN LOVE IT-
There are no Technoblade bloopers because Anarchist Pig is perfect ❤

ghostbur wanting to get revived was such a SHOCKING realization
We need to create a movie of the Dream SMP and SAD-ist must be a main part of it! Mojang should patreon it because will be talking about Minecraft, no one ever did something like the Dream SMP, and SAD-ist work is what makes it even more meaningful. We need a movie! WE NEED A MOVIE!
Love this so much
This just cured my sleeping disorder at 2am thank you Sadist
LMFAO tommy's laugh is just: fOrCiBlY sCrEaMs
This is why i love the smp so much

I'm so happy sadist made this
THIS IS SO COOL
I'm dying, someone please save me, it's too funny.

“I can’t do the dishwasher, I’m in the middle of a war, mum!”
Holy shit SAD-ist got a youtooz! when are you getting on the Dream SMP!
Would you believe me   When Im was coming back from football stadium I wss thinking ,, I would like to see SAD-ist upload bloopers" My phone was at the home When I saw the notification  I needed to write this
Brilliantly done 👌🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Best video on this channel
UHHH RANBOO ANIMATION WHEN????💳💥💳💥💳
What do you use to animate?
the litle dancing sadists in the end tho
DreamSMP lore bloopers are 10x better animated
Tommy sounds like he’s dying everytime he laughs
Lmaooo
''SAD-ist put that in''
1/2 videos for the month. one to go     cant wait *childish squeaking*
Wilbur at the beggining is just great
Alternate title Dream SMP unscripted moments animated
Two birds with one stone: Good scenes we've always wanted animated + A blooper reel Life couldn't be better AND THE CUTE END SPRITES AHH
*extreme laughing and concerned mums asking for you to empty the dishwasher during a war*
I didn’t read the “Bloopers” bit in the title and thought she was joining the Dream Smp 😭
I love all the transitions between lore and IRL. :)
I love SAD-ist being the cameraman for the dream smp, filming the stuff happening like a movie producer.
Sad-ist ily
OH MY GOSH I FREAKING LOVE IT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I DEFENitly WANT ONE OF THOSE SADIST YOUTOOZS AAAA
Oh, SAD-ist, I can't decide what is your best animation. My favorite part of this is when Tommy's mom comed🤣🤣🤣...  Ok, I got to stop laughing or im gonna die beacuse of it
Alternate title: SAD-IST MAKES THE DREAM SMP 1000% FUNNIER!
Bahahahahaha
Here before Tommy’s comment
i was hoping for technoblade misplacing the wither skulls  lmao
Get ready boys
Not Dream blowing himself up with TNT- 💀🤚
It’s so wholesome that Sad-ist is so well recognized by the Dream SMP members, like Wilbur literally said “Sad-it’s put this into the animatic” I love it
The content we didn't know we needed but we are all loving it!
I LOVE UR VOICE AA
Im getting old barbie movies energy and its great
I'd die to see a serious Sadist animatic and at the most dramatic part Tommy is Unstacking the dishwasher in the background or somethin idk 😂😂
please make more of this.. It made my day <3
2:05 “I’m in the middle of a war mum.” Mum: dishwasher is more important
I love it

Sadist makes animation  1000% funnyer?!?!?
She sounds like camila not gonna lie
a really happy sad
IT'S BEAUTIFUL ❤️❤️💛💙

Having sadist with the camera is amazing, it’s like it’s a move shoot. Well, the animatics are like mini movies in themselves so...
Sadist ur voice dosent seem sad so I'm happeh
rule number one of not getting something animated: NEVER SAY "DONT ANIMATE THAT"

Where is the petition to whitelist SAD-ist?
DUCK IT DANCING SAD-IST
Oi
I'm so glad you posted I thought you would stop posting
SADist has a voice? Impossible
gotta enjoy the undertale music at the start  The music from undertale is perfection for all video
It would be cool to see sadist character in animation doing more stuff.
SO FUNNY LMAOOO!!!!!
i need that youtooz
I've always wanted to see you animate tommy utterly dying at dream blowing himself up
Tommy: DO NOT ANIMATE THAT SAD-ist: i shall do my job tommy...im sorry
You know, its nice that SAD-ist actually took the effort to animate all this, it just shows that even if its a joke video, she'll still go out of her way to make it better.
"I WAS DOING SO WELL NOOOO-"
love the little hamilton thing on the youtooz
The way that Tommy is in a good amount of bloopers says a lot about him.
I remember watching the first one 😭😭
This made those funny moments a thousand times funnier XD
I HAVE BEEN FED FOR A MONTH THANKS SADIST!😀
haha now we wait for sad animatic 🙂
youtooz all the wayy
Lore episodes now have a 40 per cent chance to be interested by outside force
can we just appreciate how cute the outro is-
Wow, just stunning
Animators and their bloopers. Sadist and drista char art looks so similar.
This tops the ones before it
HAVENT EVEN SEEN IT YET BUT ITS GONNA BE A BANGER!!
SAD-ist makes Dream SMP 1000% funnier
bloopers
Blooper reals are always the best lol. This is absolutely great xD
Lul

Definitely getting that Youtooz! It's literally near my birthday so it's perfect!
279k view in 50 minutes?!
:D
hebfhwsvfhsdhfguj my love for you is immeasurable
I like to think that the dream smp is a tv show that’s filmed and such by animators, and all the people who act in it still live in that town area when it’s not filmed and that’s all the non lore stuff
Epic
The second you uploaded, my day got better
Your voice 😍
Why are u sad?
I like how every time one of the DSMP members says not to animate something, it ends up getting animated- xDD
3:28
Oh no
AM JUST WAITING FOR THE WILBUR REVIVAL ANIMATION
Pogger, we got a shitpost
Whatttty.  That made me laugh a lot!!!
omgg
Tommy’s mum is the Dreamwastaken in this place.

I think Dream actually said at some point that he smited Tommy during the Doomsday war because he thought it would make for a fun/interesting moment. But the animatics are all great either way.
Sad-ist has become the Happy-ist
Ah yes. True beauty has been found.

This is sooooo goood.... btw that 1 frame of Techno is this month technocontent
Petition for sad-ist to join the smp
Hearing sadists voice the first time!

Dear SAD-ist,                                        Your art is awesome! And my sister is trying to animate and she said, that it is hard as ever.              You should make a tutorial on your art! (If not already,). And also your`e under rated.

Tommy : "Don't dare to animate that" Sa-Dist : "Mmm... What blooper should I also add in..." *looks at that blooper* "Ah... A perfect one"

I like the dancing in the end
OH GOD HELP ME  I SOULS OUT
Ranboo in your artstyle>>>
Ok
One of my favorite videos on the internet :]
ok nvm, THIS is got to be my favorite video XD
LMFAO
This feels like the end credits in "Toy Story" where there's just the bloopers and cuts apart from the actual epic film XD
We all know the Dream tnt death.
THESE ARE SO FUNNY WHAT
MotherInnit is canon and no one can tell me otherwise
Tommy getting struck by lightning is the best one Change my mind
I know it's kind of random, but I think, sad-ist maybe could make an animation of mythrodakTV escaping titans vault, because I am shure it would be very cool, as she is one of the most talented animators of this world. (Just my opinion, if you think the same then please leave a like at this comment, so maybe sadist will see it)
I don't know if anyone's mentioned this yet but this video also starts with a Wilbur clip...
Pogchamp
SO FUNNY
its unhealthy how fast i clicked onto this... stalker arc???

SO LONG THESEUS
The Bloopers of the Dream Smp
MOTHERINNIT HAS MADE IT TO THE ANIMATICS WHOOOOOO
I love how most of these bloopers involve Tommy
even sad-ist uploading schedule is better than techno's
1:44 I don't know if it's the fact that his character has been through several wars or that his clothes are baggy but rp!Tommy looks bulkier than cc!Tommy and I'm just like that transition. Makes the scene even more hilarious
Even in a joke animation there’s so much detail!
Thank you SAD-ist
This is perfect 😂😂😂😂
The mad man did tommy and Wilbur proud
I can't believe TommyInnit beat me to commenting on this video.
this is so great 😭😭
Sad-Ist youtooz? I GOTTA GET ONE OF THOSE.They also look very cute :D
Sadist blooper make everything 1000% funnier!
THAS WAS SO GREAT AND FUNNY OMG 😣❤️
“So long Theseus” XD
1:22 sadist is either crying or dying of laughter...noo one will truly knows
This is the best shit ever.
I love the transitions from the roleplay to reality ABJSF
basically all the bloopers are tommy
This is the best thing I’ve seen all year
SAD-IST ACTUALLY DID A BLOOPER REEL- YOU MAD LAD!
You know I hate youtube normally but you, you really deserve subscribers i hope you will get even bigger soon :)
THERE'S MY BELOVED AT THE END YOOOOOOOOOOO (Great video that I've dreamt about you making thank you)
Ranboo my beloved finally got a speaking part
Can we acknowledge that the common thread between most of these bloopers is none other than Tommyinnit
Her mask: :(  Her mouth: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
We also need the Techno spawn the wither blooper😂
this is the funniest video ever
This is so good

0:37 that face lol
I didn't even notice when did I like the video
THANK YOU FOR THIS HAHAHA
TOMMY’S LITTLE “ what. “ always gets me and it’s right before he’s struck by lighting LMAO
Ghost bur: i want you to bring me back..to life.. Tommy:*gets struck by lightning * ._. HSHHSDHDJDJSUSJJSJSI
1:13 you could have added Ranboo spamming "CANON" in the chat
Tommy's laugh is so scary but u love it LMAO
1:14 Is dream okay lmao
PEOPLE THAT WANT PART 2 CAN LIKE CUZ THIS IS HILARIOUS
YOOOO ITS DROPPING ON MY BIRTHDAY MUST GET MUST GET
I love the little sadist(s?) At the end
The way SAD-ist's hair moves back from Wilbur yelling at 0:34 is a great touch
dream : joins vc ranboo :  *thinks* ok more lore *acts better and focused* dream : im about to end this mans whole career
Fascinating
Should’ve dropped the youtooz on the 16th
still very funny and well animated well deserves a subscribe and like
The animation is good
LMAO I LOVE THIS
THIS IS SO FUNNY AND COOL AT THE SAME TIME DIDBSUSISHS
Surprise you didn’t add “Dream bring it back we were gonna make it into a table!”
I LOVE HOW YOUR YOOTOOZ HAS HAMIL- sorry, let me calm down...it’s very cool that your yootooz has Hamilton on it.
Little dancing sadist was so wholesome
Cute
PLEASE THIS IS TOO FUNNYYY
Beautiful
Now you may be asking, "Why on earth is our lord and saviour technoblade not in this" and the answer is, he is always in character, without fail and without fault. You might think oh well: this example of him 'bloopering', fun fact, that is in character, even when he gets super meta it is in character. Yes the Dream XD interaction is real, you cannot tell me no, techno did most certainly talk to the god of the dsmp.
This channel is growing like crazy really proud of you sadist watching you from the escapism hollow knight video
I CANT GET UR YOUTOOZ OMG IM SO SAD- 😭😭😭😭
"PLEASE DO NOT ANIMATE THAT"  ...  SAD-ist: ":)"
THIS IS AMAZING

"I CAN'T EMPTY THIS DISHWASHER IM LIVE!"  -Tommyinnit, while in the middle of a war

we're all laughing now, but if Sadist actually animated the exile arc we would have balled our eyes out-
Tommy be like: WHY DID YOU ANIMATED IT, I ASKED TO NOT!
Sad-ist should put a small little funny scene at the end of her animations

I never thought in a million years that sad ist will do a bloopers video
lol!!
lmfao great vid
That blooper is just proof that Wilbur no longer cares about getting kicked out his office lol
Love it this was so funny your animation is always so amazing!!!
The way that Dream's ghost goes up to the camera and it shakes... and then you see third person, him holding an actual camera. Even though this is a joke and it's quite funny, it's still excellently animated!!
Yoo
The dancing sad-ists at the end really pull it together

Dude what the frick you can’t just do that to me! Seeing a Sad-ist  new video notification like that pop up my screen out of nowhere, bro I would have to stop literally whatever it is I’m doing no matter how “important” it is   Dude that scared me I really just freaked out all of a sudden for a sec and came down finally after like a minute when I finished the video...   Wow is that how a whiplash feels?
Me causally checking sad-ist youtooz every 10 minnutes even though i know it wont come out

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the bloopers Nation attacked. Only the angst, master of all , could stop them. But when the  world needed him most, he vanished.

I literally just rewatched all the animations today.Good to have another one to add to the list.
I will never get to write "first".  I'm here 5 minutes after he uploaded and there are fing 667 coments.  Maybe it's my destiny not to have that much pover
Ok I love the differences in the designs for the cs and ccs so much
This is beautiful. This is perfection.

Wilbur : *breaks the fourth wall ironically*   Sadist : *i have never been so disappointed in my life..*
AHHHH THE FACT YOU PUT URSELF IN MORE I LOVE IT
Love this, also best believe that when that Sad-ist Youtooz comes out I'm gonna try and buy it as soon as I can before they sell out
I wish you added techno telling Tommy "the adults are speaking" while he is defending him from dream.
Oh I love it. every clip is just so dramatic then there is just tommy "IM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR"
WAIT I’m e a r l y   PRETEND I SAID SOMETHING FUNNY AND ORIGINAL-
Such a good one SAD!
i love bloopers just as much as i love actual lore

This video was hilarious 😆
Dream faceplating at 1:32 was hilarious. Just flat out on the floor for a frame. 10/10 would laugh like a tea kettle again.
First Time i hear SAD-ist's voice and it's very nice

No matter what SADist does it is always awesome
that dream death blooper was such great timing like the comedic relief in such an intense stream I'll never get over it
me waiting for this to get on trending
I love how the creators actually address SAD-ist personally. Like that must feel so amazing. Imagine being so good at making fan content that the actual creators address you personally WHILE CREATING CONTENT! I'm so proud of you!
I love bloopers

I love the way the scenes shift between minecraft and reality
3:28 This outro is absolutely amazing.
Little dancing sadists were so cute
Sad-ist is canon as the 4th wall breaker director, and I love that
"So long Theseus" LMAO
These bloopers scenes was so nostalgic 😂 I just can't help remembering the things that happened at those times..
Did anyone notice her height was short when she was recording in some of these scenes
SADIST MY BELOVED THIS IS AMAZING LMAI
isn't it funny when the smp members personally order you to animate things x'D
lol this is so funny
I always wanted a bloopers video but I never thought it would be that funny 😂😂
Let’s be honest. We all knew Tommy’s mom had to be in one of these
The Ending just gives me life tbh
When Dream died I remember laughing uncontrollably and my family thought I was crazy
You forgot to add when Tommy’s stream crashed when he was visiting dream in prison “for the last time.”
You are the besttttttttttt
I got some fanart i need to make.
Thank you for this.

OMG SO GOOD HAHAHAH
me muero por el youtooz 😭‼️
When Sadist uploads I click faster than Dream dying
I love all of these and especially the first one cuz Wilbur addressed sad-ist completely knowing they'd animate it 😂😂😂
My favorite part was the “talking sad-ist” blooper
I love how Sadist added an intro! Congrats on the Youtooz!
HAHAA I WAS LAUFHUNG SO MUCH PFFFR
7 minutes early!!
i- i loved this so fricking much-        *Tofublob died due to a laughing fit*                                               also sadly my parents dont like me joining giveaways :(
Hi Your vids are mad I like how you upload once a month
So Long, Theseus...

Tommy preparing to comment be like: 👁👄👁✏️
we can only hope the dishwasher was emptied peacefully
Cool

tommy: *don’t animate that*  SAD-ist: *evil laughter*
oh my god i’m cracking up YOU ACTUALLY MADE A BLOOPERS REEL
bless sadist for animating the bloopers ♥️
I just became a Tea kettle like dream.
Okay the bloopers are really good but let us talk about the little sad-ists dancing at the end. look at them vibing. what good beans they are.

Kay tryna get a good liked comment             Hi.
BLOOPERS YAYAYA
Alternative title: Men and women trying to get a war script right for for 3 minutes and 38 second's
Let's goooo
Best
Now this, this is epic.
Oh god this is sooo cute and im proud you now have youtooz god sheeeeeeesh Im oficial old now! Your animations memes so inspired me draw!
The way dream falls when getting his stuff back im dying
HAHAHA JFJKHJHKGJJKHJJTJHKGFCF PLSS-
Tommy: please- do not animate that—  SAD-ist: and I took that as a challenge
I love how sadist is the cameraperson just being dissapointed at everyone
OMG I'M SO PROUD OF HER GETTING HER OWN YOUTOOZ AAAAAAA
banger video as always !!!
GREAT JOB YOUR ANIMATIONS ARE ALWAYS SO AWESOME
I was not expecting this but I'm glad it happened
DAMNNNNNN THE VID WAS SICK AND HILARIOUS BUT THE OUTRO WAS SO GOOD!! KEEP IT UP!
Oh wow, it's so cool to see your ghostbur and ranboo designs fully animated! They look amazing
RANBOO HAHAHHAHA
another banger !!!
the animated expressions are cool =D
This is epic
this was awesome haha! i was wondering if you were ever gonna animate the bloopers for a meme and you did, better than i expected! great job, this made me laugh a bunch :D
when sadist was recording dream exploding
AMAZING I'M EARLY YEESS
Hell yeah this is amazingg
WOAH YOUR A GIRL?! 🤣🤣🤣
Ur a Filipino right?? <3
This is epic 🔥😆
Wilbur: *breaks the fourth wall*  Sad-Ist: *disappointment*
Ok but the SAD-ist Youtooz looks really cool-
I love the idea that sadist is a director/camera person just following everybody around filming
It is 100% canon in my mind that Sad-ist is a part of the SMP.  Always in the background.  Waiting. Lurking.  Watching until someone will, inevitably, fuck up.  And she shall animate it.
YOOOOOOO
i love the way u draw tommy
PLEASE THE BLOOPERS ARE LIKE THE BEST PART LOL
This video made my day...  I was ‘sad’ (pun intended lmao)  But now I am happy :>
SADist THIS WAS SO CUTEEE

Waffles  2 cups all purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup whole milk ½ cup buttermilk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs, separated ⅓ cup sugar nonstick cooking spray, for greasing butter, for serving maple syrup, for serving  1. Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high. 2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla, and egg yolks. Whisk until the batter just comes together (there will be some lumps). 3. Add the egg whites to a medium bowl and beat with an electric hand mixer until foamy. With the mixer running, gradually add the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter until just combined. 4. Spray the heated waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray. Ladle the batter into the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook according to manufacturer’s instructions until the waffle is golden brown and crisp, 5–6 minutes. Transfer the waffle to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter. 5. Serve the waffles hot, with butter and maple syrup alongside. 6. Enjoy.

Waffles  2 cups all purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup whole milk ½ cup buttermilk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs, separated ⅓ cup sugar nonstick cooking spray, for greasing butter, for serving maple syrup, for serving  1. Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high. 2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla, and egg yolks. Whisk until the batter just comes together (there will be some lumps). 3. Add the egg whites to a medium bowl and beat with an electric hand mixer until foamy. With the mixer running, gradually add the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter until just combined. 4. Spray the heated waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray. Ladle the batter into the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook according to manufacturer’s instructions until the waffle is golden brown and crisp, 5–6 minutes. Transfer the waffle to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter. 5. Serve the waffles hot, with butter and maple syrup alongside. 6. Enjoy.
