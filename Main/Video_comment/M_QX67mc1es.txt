Dawg what fkn duke did was screaming steppers cant dance for shit dawg that shit was mad boring i aint gon lie A for effort tho
"yo ass look like corbin bleu" lmfao he not wrong XD  Kai with the "agent coming in like it seems today that all you see" I died hahahaha  The winner in my eyes was Agent. He was the most out of his comfort zone. Not really dancing ever to dancing to an interesting genre that none of the guys could probably do, to do get into it, memorize most of the choreo, and that toe touch. Duke was just walking most of the time, Kai...that's in his comfort zone, davis was just super awkward lmao.
Kai roasting at the end 🔥🤣🤣
Kai part of the song is called - I WANT IT ALL BY CHRISCNEXTDOOR
Bro duke literally did backhand spring
“bbl gang”🤣🤣🤣
WHY NOBODY TALKING ABT DAVID HE DID GREAT FOR NOT BEING A DANCER 😭

Amp should do a survival of the fittest: Where you’re stranded for 2-3 days and the teams is split up to 2 or 3 participants and you have to do objectives like [ making a fire, and fishing.ETC] but you have to be completely stranded no tents no tools or essential only raw meat you have to cook on YOUR fire. And you should include other YouTubers like, Davo Migo, The affiliates, Ty Brazy, Deestroying, Aj Greene , Adin Ross, ETC. Basically like a hood Survival series
Real winner is Duke.

Remember, the Democrats want to arm all Ukrainians and make you pay for it with your taxes while they disarm law-abiding American citizens.  Also, Biden gave the Taliban in Afghanistan 20,000 American M4s for free after his disastrous withdrawal that got 30 Marines killed, but he wants to confiscate weapons from law-abiding Americans that they paid for with their hard-earned money.  Also, Fidel Castro Jr. (aka Justin Trudeau) just banned hand-guns in Canada, over a crime that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN CANADA, so you know that they're lying when they say that they only want to ban "military-style rifles."  Also, Democrats constantly scream that the police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people, but yet they want to disarm all black people so only the police have guns.  OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY RUSSIA.....zjzjz
Democrats: "The police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people!" Also Democrats: "We should take away black people's guns so only the "rayciss" police have guns!" WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUCK????????  In Canada, Fidel Castro Jr. just banned all hand-guns over a crime THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN CANADA, so you know that they're lying when they say that they only want to ban "military style rifles."  They want to ban ALL GUNS.....sjxjx

And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers': because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.”-Tobit‬ ‭3:2-5‬  “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;”-Acts‬ ‭3:19‬   “Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance.”-Ecclesiasticus 5:7  “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”-John‬ ‭14:15‬  “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.”-1 John‬ ‭5:3  “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” -Revelation‬ ‭22:14‬  “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”-Hebrews‬ ‭11:6‬  “that at the name of YAHAWASHI every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that YAHAWASHI HAMASHIACH is Lord, to the glory of YAHAWAH the Father.”-Philippians‬ ‭2:10-11‬  “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”-Revelation‬ ‭13:16-17‬  “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:”-Revelation‬ ‭14:9-10‬  QAM(Rise) YASHARAHLA(Israel)🙏🏾   We Are More Then A Color In A Crayon Box🙏🏾  “I have said, Ye are gods; And all of you are children of the most High.”-Psalm‬ ‭82:6‬  “Ye are the salt of the earth:”-Matthew‬ ‭5:13‬  “But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.”-Isaiah‬ ‭45:17‬  KAL HALAL LA YAHAWAH BAHASHAM YAHAWASHI🙏🏾

NAWWWWWWWWW MY HEART CANT TAKE THIS NO WAY THATS JOSH. FINALLY MY MANS BIGGGGGGGGGG KANK WHO ALWASY CAME WITH THE EXCLUSIVES has made his Apperaence. when he poped up at 3:40 , id never been happier to watch a AMP vid. that man right there my inspiration for this youtube shit. Yah gotta throw him into more videos. Only the OG's remember of the PRIME 2K17 era, and all the summer games with fanum and davis etc... like Friday the 13th streams, the GTA streams, even the early early fortnite days. so manny memories like the twitch movie nights. bro the davis diss track, the bald extendo head meme of davis. the McFanum cause his ass was on the wraps heavy, when the name was still PhantomSlice.  i could go on for hours. its just crazy how 6-7 months ago ( @kankles @Big Kank ) you was streaming and we were talking about how you couldve been in AMP but for now you just edit sometimes and after the injury you went. Man @ImDavisss @ImDavisss Deluxe @Fanum Live @JustFanum @Agent 00 @Agent 00 Exclusive @Agent 00 Gaming @AMP If yah see this please throw my mans is more videos, of course if hes down.
Y’all should throw a masquerade ball 🙌! Just make sure y’all invite me 😭
Ngl I was cheesin this whole video, AMP TOP TIER!
JESUS CHRIST ALONE DIED FOR YOUR SINS & WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE GRAVE!  HE IS ALIVE & COMING BACK ANY DAY WITH JUDGEMENT (THESE ARE END DAYS)!  HE IS RETURNING TO TAKE HIS BRIDE HOME AND IF YOU AREN'T RIGHT WITH HIM (THAT INCLUDES THE SLEEPING "CHRISTIAN" CHURCHES) YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND TO FACE THE WORST TIME IN HISTORY BY FAR (TRIBULATION).  WW3, GLOBAL FAMINE, 9-10.0 EARTHQUAKES ALL OVER THE WORLD, 100S OF VOLCANOES GOING OFF AT THE SAME TIME, 100S OF FOOT TSUNAMIS WILL WIPE OUT MAJOR CITIES.  ON TOP OF IT THE ANTICHRIST WILL KILL ANYONE WHO WONT SERVE HIM AND TAKE HIS MARK (TAKE IT = NO HEAVEN).  BILLIONS WILL DIE... IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME READ REVELATION.  GOD HAS GIVEN US CENTURIES TO TURN TO HIM AND HAS BEEN PATIENT BUT WE KEEP GOING AGAINST HIM AND HIS WAYS.  THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AND THE ONLY WAY HE CAN WAKE PEOPLE UP IS TO TAKE AWAY EVERY CORRUPT THING WE PUT OUR HOPE IN.  IF YOU PUT YOUR FAITH IN ANYTHING OF THIS WORLD OR MAN YOU WILL PERISH WITH THIS WORLD AND CORRUPT MAN.  THERE IS 1 GOD & HE IS EVERLASTING, CREATOR OF ALL.  WORSHIP HIM, NOT HIS CREATION!  SERVE HIM, NOT YOURSELVES OR THIS WORLD!    PREPARE YOURSELVES, TURN FROM SIN & RUN TO JESUS!  HE KNOWS YOUR PAIN & TROUBLES, HE WANTS TO HEAL & RESTORE YOU!  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND!  ASK HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU & HELP YOU TO BELIEVE IF YOU DOUBT!  DON'T WAIT TO CRY OUT!  NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW AND THE SIGNS OF HIS COMING TALKED ABOUT IN THE BIBLE HAVE TAKEN PLACE! HE LONGS FOR YOU TO INVITE HIM IN, HE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER COULD, HE CREATED YOU!   Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23

I like how Agent was mad asf but ended up killing his performance 😂💪🏼 Real AMP Sh*t
Yuhhhhh davissssss
The uncontrolled, ungoverned use of thought and feeling has brought about all kinds of discord, sickness and distress. Few, however, believe this, and keep going on and on continually creating by their ungoverned thought and desire, chaos in their worlds; when they could as easily as a breath face about, using their thought constructively with the motive power of divine love, and build for themselves a perfect paradise within the period of two years.
YO AMP SHARK TANK 🔥 🔥
Do the shark tank Idea also bro that bud gone be fire

Believe in Jesus. He loves u Salvation doesn't come from our good deeds or by doing anything special, it's a free gift from God just because He loves us so much. We need to turn away from our sins, believe that Jesus is God's Son and our Savior, and submit to Him as Lord of our lives. By doing so, we receive salvation and eternal life!!!
Not gonna lie the video was funny, but yall had shown the other side of Kai and that just some disrespectful shit. I honestly hope Davis do more bigger and better things, as well with Agent that really suprising to seeing to his athlete side and be able to touch like that. Props to all the big men in the world.

The simple plan of Salvation.  1. Admit that you are a sinner and need to be saved. (No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his or her own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still fall short.)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; - Romans 3:23 KJV  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not of works, lest any man should boast. - Ephesians 2:8‭-‬9 KJV  2. Realize the penalty for sin, repent and be willing to turn from your sin. (Just as there are wages for good, there is punishment for sin. The penalty for our sin is eternal punishment in a place called Hell.)  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Romans 6:23 KJV  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: - Hebrews 9:27 KJV  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. - Revelation 21:8 KJV  3. Believe that Christ died for you on the cross of Calvary. (Christ great love for us was shown when He died on the cross to pay our sin debt.)  For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:6‭-‬8 KJV  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - John 14:6 KJV  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: - 1 Corinthians 15:3‭-‬4 KJV  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. - 1 Peter 2:24 KJV  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: - 1 Peter 3:18 KJV  4. Receive Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour into your heart and life through prayer. (Everlasting life is a gift purchased by the blood of Jesus and offered freely to those who call upon Him by faith.)  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. - John 5:24 KJV  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. - Romans 10:13 KJV  Prayer of Salvation: “Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner.  I know that I need you. I believe that you died on the cross for me and rose again. Forgive me of my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life to you. I receive you as my Saviour, come into my life and save me. Thank you for what you did on the cross for me.  Amen.”
