She’s so good though! A natural vlogger 😍
Ottie in the background undoing the wrapping paper sent me. Main character.
I remember this game you played it for your office one time during Christmas ❤😂😂😂 it was so hilarious and I remember u saying it was one of the best memories u have and had such an amazing time
I’m also insane when it comes to hosting. Like no one can know I live here 😂 I have perfected the art of making the house look lived in though
Oh wow you went to Eltham Palace, that is near my home. Its actually pronounced elt-am dont pronounce the h 😅
Who is the lady at 15.14?
PLEASE CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE ALFIE GOT HIS JEANS FROM AND WHAT THEY ARE CALLED/FIT PLEASE 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Love the tree decor.  So cute!
I agree about muppet Christmas Carol! I wish I could see it in concert!
Anyone know where Zoe’s weighted blanket is from? 😍😍😍
I love how you are with each other esp. with Ottie. So lovely 🥰
I love that Ottie has already sussed out how to work a vlog camera and was trying to line up the shot 😂
Zoe babe it's pronounced Ell-tum hahaha!!
Ottie has definitely been here before. So wise. She reminds me of the baby from baby’s day out 🥰
I always wonder where you get your Christmas tree lights from/what type are they. Can never seem to find similar ones. Recommendations?
Ive been watching you for >10 years now and it has been so amazing to experience your journey through life. You and Alfie are amazing parents, I love how calm you both are and how magical you make life for Ottie.  As my hubby and I start start our family planning journey I look up to you on how to be good mother one day (I also will be stealing some of your creative Christmasy things for my daughter or son one day). Thank you for continuing to vlog and sharing tid bits of your life with us!
AAaaa I grew up watching you both! Your baby arrived about 8 months before mine, but I still watched your journey when I was pregnant. It felt so familiar and like I had a friend. This is my first child as well and it's so cute seeing you both handle your days in similar ways as our litle family.~ hurry while she is napping!~ Lots of love to all three of you!
Seeing you with Ottie somehow really reminds me of Rachel with Emma!!!!
I love vlogmas but every year I get tested with the way you put lights on your Christmas tree 😂 START FROM THE TOP please 😂😂😂❤️
Question for Sunday : what is your favourite thing about vlogmas ?
She turned the camera on its official she is gonna be a youtuber
my first Christmas time at university is quite lonely without my family and friends around me but your vlogmas makes a bit of every day a lot better 🫶🏻
the uhm's at the end really took me out
Zoe is such a Monica as an hostess <3
These videos are bringing such brightness to my days! Thank you 😊
Zoe if you get to do your Bath and Body Works candle haul there is one here in Australia (so I hope you can get it 🤞🏻) called Hot Cocoa and Cream and you would LOVEEE it!!!  I smelt it and immediately thought cozy Zoe vlog thoughts
Ottie cam could be a thing this vlogmas. lol She loves filming her mummy and daddy.
💗💓💓💓
Zoe and Alfie - I just want to say that I am truly enjoying these Vlogmas videos. So excited for them to keep coming! (I'm catching up)
"Ottie proof" x)
Hearing Allie calling zoe into the room with him and ottie was so cute my heart palpitated. She is his gorgeous
Zoe: I think you need a little more training Ottie: I think this vlog needs a little more ME
Putting lights up is the best thing!!!  I love it !!  I'll just wait until you need me"!!!  Ottie does not miss a beat!!  Watch out Alfie, she might be editing the next vlog!!! lol
i think this has to be one of my favourite vlogs, not sure what it is but ottie just holding the camera, the classic christmas tree set up with a little addition to the family.. made me tear up honestly
Where’s the wrapping paper from!
* Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.   (Ecclesiastes 12:13) * This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.   (John 17:3) * This is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.   (2 John 1:6) * Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)
They could've pay someone to clean and decorate the house...this is what I like about Zoe and Alfie 👏🏼✨
Can anyone tell me where Otties shirt is from?
Alfie is such a loving and gentle father. So nice to see. I'm also pregnant right now and I think and hope that my boyfriend will be like that with our daughter🫶🏻 Greetings from Germany
Nala snoring is everything
Alfie will love having a toddler now, she can help him open his gifts and make it less awkward for him. 😊
i've been watching your vlogmas for years now & I can't explain how happy it makes me that you now have a little one to share your christmas joy with <33
the amount of serotonin running through my veins from watching your vlogmas & the classic zoe on top of alfies shoulders shot for the christmas tree star just warms my heart <333
this is my advent calendar
Watching this brings back so many good memories from your past vlogmas
I started laughing so much at ottie taking the plastic off the wrapping paper and then ripping it in the background !
I felt so much love in that small touch Alfie gave Zoe across her lower back when they were decorating the tree. *crying*
I really like them lights where did you get them from
In America, the little present game is called white elephant gifts.  Same rules, I believe. 🎁🎄
who was watching ottie ripping the paper and say ahmmm zoe, you might want to see that ahahaaha
Omg Ottie the cameraman is adorable I love her 🤍
I usually don’t have any Christmas spirit for the past couple of years but when I watch Zoe’s vlogmases it just comes naturally. And it’s so odd to realize that I’ve followed this channel for like 5 or 6 years and now I see a happy family it warms my heart
Zoe saying they havent got matching PJs when decorating the christmas tree yet their outfits are almost the same! Love that! ❤❤😃
G
Eltham is where both myself and Henry V11 grew up!
The intro to this video was so cute and well done
hahaha nala snoring in the background is so cute
The way you said “we are home” at the end of the vlog sounded soooo Australian 😂😂  Your vlogmas has been my absolute favourite for as long as I can remember💖  Hope this Christmas season treats everyone well 🎄 xoxo
Watching Zoe's Vlogmas is one of the best things about December🥰 also well done Alfie as this wouldn't be able without your help xx
Volgmas with ottie
Ottie is adorable   the camera bit was so heart warming I bet she has her own  baby channel you don't know about 😂.  The lights where fantastic ans so pretty
Absolutely adore ottie vlogging, it makes the videos imho 🤣
Awww, Ottie is too cute. I love these Vlogmas videos so much.
Ottie's first time decorating the tree 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️🥰
Where is The Merry Christmas to all pillowcase from?😍😍
I'M soooo happy you're doing Vlogmas  again! Been watching since the very first year, and I now also have a daughter who's 17 months old! I see so many similarities with Ottie, love love loveee watching you and your family everyday!
This Vlogmas and all the lovely people here, just brings me joy and happiness! I just love this community that you created, and thankful for so many lovely people here! :)
I am so happy that you guys decided to do vlogmas! My favourite part of the day!! ♥️
UUUUUF WHAT A VIDEO.............😱 LOVE FROM INDIA ❤
Ottie is so gonna be a vlogger once she’s older, she won’t leave that damn camera alone it’s so cute! She’s already a pro
The light walk looked amazing 😍
My daughter loves the gruffalo
Ottie you don’t disappoint me 😂😂😂 I was waiting for you to take out all of the small advant calendar presents 😜❤️😊   And opening up all the presents under the tree……..that while take about 2 more years untill the age of 3 😂😊🥰🤣😂 I already hear her say: oooooh ohhhh or suprise 😊☺️
I love vlogmas, but darn it Ottie! You are stinkin cute and its giving me baby fever.
She’s really cute ❤
Loving these videos!  Your both doing an amazing job
These videos feel like a warm hug. 💗
thank you for making every holiday season a little bit more special 💞✨
Her little sweater vest I can’t
I’ve really loved vlogmas in 2022. It has been a shit year for me and my family and this has really brightened my month. Thank you so much!   The Christmas light walk looks very similar to Vivid Sydney that the CBD puts on in June. If anyone lives in Aus, you’d know but it’s such a great event and it gives me all the Aus winter vibes ☺️🔥
"I'm glad we've nailed it." 😂😂😂😂
Completely understand when you were talking about hosting at your house. It's about wanting loved ones to feel special and have zero stress whole at your house. It's not a vanity thing at all. I go through the same thing when having people over because I want them to have a wonderful time while being cared for.
Honestly bringing me so much joy 🥰 thanks so much zoe!!
I love that you two are working together to make this happen. It makes me very happy.
Otty taking the camera is the cutesttt thing everrrrr 🤌🏼❤️
I love these vlogs so much! It's so lovely to see you with your sweet family. Thank you for sharing!
Can you link Ottie’s first outfit please?
Zoe I doubt you will see this but massive thanks to you and Alfie cause the run up to this Christmas has been very stressful and worrying and somewhat sad as my gran has been sick and it brings back a lot of memories of losing my mum around this time six years ago. Thankfully my gran is on the mend but I’ve just been so drained emotionally and you doing Vlogmas has picked my soul up so much so thank you
bless amanda and nick for coming to the rescue xx
Did everyone else notice who turned to look at the lights on the Xmas tree!! 😂🌟
Seeing ottie sitting on her dad's shoulders made me remember when I was sitting on my dad's one as a child and I was scared because he is sooo tall😂
ottie being cameraman is what im here for
Alfie Deyes is becoming handsome and more handsome with each passing day! 😭❤️‍🩹
thank you for doing vlogmas this year <3 I really appreciate your's and alfie's teamwork! this made my bad day so much better :)
Zoe thank you so much for another year of vlogmas. NO matter how many you get out I will cherish each one as they're my own memories. You guys have been there for me thru countless ups and downs forever grateful for the smile I find within myself when I watch your videos. Blessings 💓🎄🌄
It feels so FESTIVE & Vlogmas are my favourite kind of vlogs :-) I have some too if you'd like to watch :-)
Awe I live just round the corner from Eltham Palace 🥰, also eltham u gotta pronounce it with a bit of a south east London accent 🤣its Elt -ham we don’t say the th as a sound aha
Where is your weighted blanket from?? :)
You would love Wollaton Park in Nottingham it's all lit up at Christmas xx😃
We play that kind of secret santa game but here in Australia all I've ever heard it being called is Naughty Santa or Bad Santa. And when you play it with just adults some of the gifts are 'naughty' hahaha
I began watching vlogmas when I was 14. I'm 21 now and these videos still put me in such an amazing christmas mood. So lovely to see how Zoe's family is growing :)
coming home from work and watching this is just another feeling!!!
Whenever I watch Zoe I feel so loved ❤ she lives my dream life… I have a 4 month old and I dont like the life I live. I am so so grateful for my little girl and I want to give her the best life ❤ I want to do the things I desire and I want to enjoy life more.. hopefully one day 😢
Ottie needs to start using the camera Mark gave her 😂
Just something so comforting and warming about vlogmas! A lot has changed for zoe in the last 10 years but the feeling produced by her vlogmas is the same every year.
I think I’ve commented on every day so far but I always need to say how much I love and appreciate your vlogmas! Xx Ottie is growing into the sweetest, smartest little girl too
You said you don't have time for matching pjs now but you unintentionally matched anyway! Black jeans and white tops! 😂Loving the vlogs xxx 🥰
Zoe and Alfie you are doing an absolutly amazing job with Vlogmas ❤️🎄 they feel really really nostalgic and the added bonus of adorable little Ottie is just fantastic. You are honestly the most incredible parents. ❤️
I work for English Heritage, I hope you had the best time xx
at this point I would just love to see a whole day filmed by Ottie 😂
Have you ever done the Blenheim Palace lightwalk?? It's the BEST!! Soooo much better than the Waddesdon one. But they are ALL so beautiful!! Kew is amazing too.
It's not Christmas without zoella's vlogmas!
Aww Zoe your cameraman is the cutest thing ever. She makes me smile so big. It honestly makes my day. Stay blessed stay happy.
This is so cozy, I'm loving vlogmas💚
Ottie's little "buh-bye" is so cute!!
Okayyy but you're still matching while putting the lights on🥺❤️
You can tell that mum and dad putting on the star on the Christmas tree was such a core memory for Ottie! Thank you for sharing this with us im crying
Love that you can’t row putting the tree up because ya mums there lol 😂
Where did you get your Christmas lights from?? They are so bright and lovely!! Would love to get myself some ❤️❤️❤️
I am loving this vlogmas! I get so excited the past few nights to end my day watching them!
Lmaoo the part where Alfie says not just editor also cameraman 😂❤ sorry Alf we just love Zoe’s annual Vlogmass❤😅
vlogmas makes me so happy! 🥰
Christmas has been so festive this year already and your enthusiasm has made me excited for my own Christmas festivities even more so❤️
Great video!
❤❤❤
I love you all so much & I don’t even know u❤
I'm so on board for OttieCam every episode of Vlogmas.
I miss seeing nala and buzz in the vlogs 😫
Omg Zoe I missed seeing your vlogs! It makes me so happy to see you guys everyday!! I've been following you forrr soo long but seeing you as a mom makes me soo emotional qhahaha. Happy holidays guys ❤❤❤
Zoe I absolutely enjoy and love your Christmas Vlogmas videos makes me feel festive and fuzzy inside. Thank you so much 🎄🎁
Vlogmas this year has brought me so much joy
just gotta say watching these every night is the perfect wind up and little dose of festivity for the end of my day!
We call that game Dirty Santa. Our family has played that for years.
love when you guys put the star on together its a good tradition
I'll always love when they call each other gorgeous. it never gets old.
i’ve been watching you since 2013 but recently have been doing a vlog binge and i just want to say thank you for sharing!!! your vlogs are the best escapism ever
Otties little face in the camera is the cutest thing ever.
I love your long videos you make vlog miss so much fun.
Ok that was really surreal. I was watching Muppet’s Christmas Carol before I started the vlog and when you got to the part of decorating the tree our movies lined up almost to the minute lol kinda cool
Alfie calling Zoe gorgeous just makes my heart so happy. Your little family is so beautiful. Vlogmas on Zoe’s channel feels so homely and everything warm and cosy💙
Thank you Alfie for editing this. Absolutely loving all these videos ❤
Ottie vlog take overs are the cutest thing
Ottie is totally the greatest and most beautiful vlogger there is 😊xx
loved this!
Alfie calling Zoe gorgeous 😭
Everyday we cast on to our tv, me, hubby and my children (grown up and home from uni) and watch vlogmas. We love you guys ❤
So happy for vlogmas and the intro this year looks so good! 🫶🏼
Dear Zoo was my favorite book as a kid.
my nephew helped decorate our tree today and he broke only 2 ornaments😂 first time he actually got to help, like ottie, and it was so funny❤️
I just wanna say - your vlogmas this year makes me so happy! It’s been a hard few weeks and these have lifted me sooo much. Love them, thank you🫶🏻🥹💗
vlogmas is MY advent
I love Zoe and Alfie! They are such kind people. Admittedly there is usually always a ping of jealousy I feel when watching people be so well off. But seeing how Zoe and Alfie have earnt it over the years and continue to be appreciative and humble just makes me love them even more 🥹🎄
You guys need to watch The Traitors on BBC One, I feel like you would really get into it
THIS THE BEST SEASON HOLIDAYFOR THE WHOLE WORLD 🌍❤️  🎄⛄🌍🌍❤️⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍🎄⛄🌍❤️🎄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄🌍❤️🎄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄🎄❤️❤️🎄🎄⛄⛄❤️🌍🌍🌍🎄⛄⛄⛄🎄❤️🌍🌍❤️🎄⛄⛄❤️❤️🌍❤️🎄⛄
Ottie finding the advent calendar!😂🤣 That kid is smart!
For Ottie's toy advent calendar, only put that day's toy in its pouch every day
Cameraman Ottie is the best
I enjoy watching your vlogs it’s so entertaining and Ottie has gotten so big
Love how Ottie often wear things like the collars on T-shirts that are 19/20 year old Zoe . Like OG zoella x
✨💛🎄😍
Ottie is so smart 🤍😊
best part of my day
Hearing Nala snoring when they were sitting in the living room was so cute!
LOVING THIS VLOGMAS! The editing style is Great!
Alfie I think it’s time to give Ottie the Social media/ vlogger set you brought/given when Zoe was pregnant. Watching Ottie with the camera well let’s just say she’s pretty good.  Thanks Zoe for all the effort I haven’t been in Christmas spirit at all just had eye removed and been a rough year but these vlogs have inspired me to get off my ...... and get the decorations up. Thankyou love you guys leisa Western Australia xxx💕💕💕
so relaxing and festive 🥹🥰
This made me feel the MOST festive🎄❤️
Is just me does Zoes vlog always remind you of home videos from the 90s
Ottie is absolutely adorable and a pro with the camera she has me in stitches 🫶
Good video
so sweet and special! loved this video 🥰👍🎄❤💕💕💕
I just couldn't stop thinking "Wait until your toddler skips her day naps completely (and literally doesn't stop talking from the early morning until the moment she falls asleep at night)..."  x_______X New kind of exhaustion unlocked. But we do love them, we do! :))) <3
I absolutely adore vlogmas, and I'm so glad you've worked out a system to make this year happen :D But I must say, makes me feel a bit left out. I don't even have a tree this year 😶
Omg alfie calling zoe ‘gorgeous’ as a pet name is so cute
You all always pick such a pretty tree! It looks great.
I would love to see this years white elephant game in tomorrows vlog💕
Might be a silly question but do you pay Alfie to edit your vlogmas?
Ottilie is a complete natural. She's so switched on 😍
Zoe go check out our baubles and tree I think you'll love! Inspiration = YOU
I turned on Vlogmas notifications and it's so tough not to immediately watch the videos 😂 I'm trying to make the excitement last ❤️
Your tree is beautiful! Thank you for taking the time to do vlogmas! It means so much to us!
Ughhh this intros always fill my heart!
A trick I've found with pets and babies is to keep soft ornaments nearer to the ground so they can play with some things.
Alfie short videos are bot zoes viewers plsssss we beed our 50 mins vlogssss
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
gosh this is so cute i'm gonna sob
These vlogs always make so happy and cosy, thank you for doing this 🥰🥰🥰
🎈🎄🌟🎄🎈
Ottie is not only cute but also so funny ❤
Such a lovely vlog 🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤
that weighted blanket looks sooo cozy! where is it from?
Aww Ottie is adorable ❤
I could watch Ottie say bye to the camera for hours, those little baby hands
Ottie is just the cutest little honey with all her sass ❤
Is it just me or is the vlogmas that I’ve been dying to see since Zoe started… hoping that there’d be one with her and Alfie and their children now look.
I’ve been loving your videos!!! Great work team!   Also when I was little my mom put the tree in the pack n play so that I couldn’t get to the ornaments or the tree
so thankful for her doing these videos ♡
Thank you Alfie for making this happen. You both have made my Christmas. I know how busy you both are but I am grateful. ❤
best time of year zoeeee! (And Alfie you are MVP!)
Living for these vlogs!! Getting in bed with a hot choccie watching your videos is part of my new evening routine ❤
It’s so nice to see Ottie with her books, so many parents just sit their kids in front of an iPad and that honestly breaks my heart. My favorite memories are of my mom and grandma reading to me as a kid and no matter what anyone says I think books open a part of your imagination that no other form of media can. Such a great idea to make this bedtime routine into an advent calendar too❤
13:18 I think it's the moral support that counts😂
Thank you Alfie for making it possible haha
Wow I never knew how much I missed vlogmas. Having them everyday makes me feel so spoiled, but i love it. And the Zalfie household is just the best always, but especially at Christmas. Buying and decorating the tree are my fav eps.
Loving this year’s Vlogmas!
That light park should be lit like that all year long! What a beautiful place to go with your family. 🎄
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ottilie is quite the pro when it comes to being a vlogger. Learnt from the best see. Haha. Such a cutie. Loving these vlogmases. The nostalgia is real. 🥰🥰🥰
I think your cameraman is GREAT 😂
I have a really good tip I used to stop my children pulling down the lower decorations from the tree!  When they go to get one go "zzzzz" like an electric sound. Worked every time!!!
Where are the black leather pants from? 😍
Good luck having a tree with a one year old! 😂 ours has already been pulled over once so we’ve had to barricade it off
This feels like home. I've been watching your vlogmas for over 5 years now and each year it gives me the coziest, warmest feeling.  And for the first time, this year I'll actually be able to experience the London christmas experience and I just can't wait ❤
We need more ottie clips!!!
Many years ago i had 3 small toddlars, i found you both, in your separate flats and watched the entire  journey until current and i am just so excited,  happy, proud  (if im allowed) to see your happy little family. Many a nights when my babies were up all night alfie and zoe helped me through  without  even knowing  and now i am 35 and have all teenagers and yall have the baby! Amazing.  Happy holidays  alfie and zoe!
😂😂😂Ottie putting your camera on. Brilliant  ( No stopping her now 😜)   Wauw those Christmas light walk  looked stunning 🤩  the colours were gorgeous . What a wonderful afternoon/ evening Activity. I bet it was Busy .  Have a Lovely evening 🥰
Love Ottie vlogging, should have her use the camera Mark got her
We call that game white elephant or my personal favorite dirty Santa because of the stealing hahaha
Thank you so much for the uploads Zoe 🎄🫶🏻
I genuinely miss this so much, and I really appreciate the time and effort you both put into this vlogmas; it means a lot💞
23-19
Oh, you should really get Ottie a toy video camera for Christmas! It's so cute how engaged she always seems to be with it!! 💜💜
ottie is a natural born vlogger! 😂😂 so adorable that she turned it on and set up her shot and recorded 🖤
The sweetest notification ever!  You guys are a complete fairytale for so many years
i love your vlogmas💗🎄
I heard putting on the Christmas lights vertically is much easier to put on and take off. Try it if you still need to decorate one more tree!!!
My older person advice is that you rested is much preferred to a pretty house and two exhausted parents. We want to see you have fun and are coming to see you and enjoy family time over perfection. I love watching you guys and your gorgeous home and family. Omg Ottie into the advent calendar was hilarious.
I love when out of no where you hear UGH OH, and Ottie is holding the remote. LOL The tv is wonky and she knows she did something she shouldn't have. She is very smart. Zoe your house looks amazing and I can relate about wanting the house to look perfect. But you know people realize you have a toddler and she gets into stuff and the house won't be perfect. As long as it is clean, that is the main thing. Hope you had fun with the family.
your vlogmas has been carring me through exam season every year since 2016!!! honestly thank you haha!
😀xx
I love this chapter of you all’s life. I love seeing you as parents!
Ottie loving the camera reminds me of the little fake pink camera Mark got her when Zoe was pregnant. She would love that for sure!
ottiie is about to take over the channle XD
Definitely feels like an advent calendar watching your vlogmas each day. Look forward to it as much as I did the previous years and love how it has developed now that you have Ottie too. Team work makes the dream work 💕 Love you guys from Cape Town South Africa😘
😍❤️
What a wonderful video diary of Ottie. She is soooooo cute!!!! She could be a little baby model.
Where are your Christmas tree lights from!!!
I love Vlogmas so much!❤🎄🥰
I said this yesterday, but it bears repeating: I absolutely love the Zoe/Alfie combo vlogs! Getting a little bit of Alfie’s style creeping in 😊
Honestly I could handle the rest of vlogmas with Ottie as the camera man! 😆🥹
Loved this!! 💐
Forever grateful for these, your vlogs are my world
Otti is a natural vlogger 🤣 omg
Camera girl skills are on point!😆
I could watch ottie all day 😂 so cute
Thank you, Zoe that you do Vlogmas again! I can't imagine something more calming for me in these days and weeks.  Thank you Alfie for editing! 🤟🥳 hope you keep the energie up hehe  This year has been the worst regarding my mental health. My anxiety is at its peak at the moment. After and during having corona for the second time this year even though i'm careful, i'm just in tears. Panic attacks every day, all day- also before having Corona. This sunday i'm just laying in bed, candles on the window sills and watching your vlogs/vlogmas. First time in weeks, i'm calmer, crying happy tears and just forgetting everything.   THANK YOU ZOË! Thank you for sharing the festive, positive moments of your little family ❤️
When working in a nursery with babies, i can really see how smart ottie is!!! All babies move at different rates but she’s running!!! Can’t believe her speech at 15mnths incredible 😭
Dont stress too much about cleaning. Your home is perfect as it is.
Ottie is the most precious Child.. you are such a Lovely family. I have been watch you and Alfie since before you two were together and never have I replied. But I Just can't help myself. You are such a lovely bunch..
am i the only one who got kinda emotional when zoe and alfie were putting the star on the tree? the parallels in this vlogmas to pass vlogmas are making me so happy that you guys are living your lives with otti in such special ways❤️🥹 thank you for letting us be apart of your lives for soooo long✨
Vlogmas with Zoe always make me feel so warm and festive, I'm always more excited about Christmas after your vlogs ❤
Hey Zoe sugg and alfie  deyes  you guys truly the awesome parents to little Ottie deyes I love your vlogs so much and happy vibes to you guys again and I hope have a wonderful Christmas time with your wonderful family. Happy vlogmas day three.
Ottie is literally a blend of Zoe and Poppy and she is 100% going to be in front of the camera. Zoe’s Vlogmas is like a blend of real life and a Hallmark Christmas movie. It is the visual and audio version of a cup of hot chocolate with all the trimmings and I love living vicariously through it.
ottie is so frking cuteeeee
Those vlogs makes my heart so warm 🥹🥹 i can’t handle Ottie’s cuteness ❤
Absolutely love how you guys are already involving Ottie in so many Christmas things! Also, where are those flared leather pants from? Really love them! 😊
Ottie is so cute ❤
We know that game as Dirty Santa🎅
Great vlog
Day three and already my fave vlogmas!
gonna keep asking: strap a go-pro onto ottie for a part of each vlog. baby vlogged vlogmas pls.
You both are the cutest parents in the world! it makes my heart explode every time
I cannot tell u how much I'm enjoying these vlogs, it's like Christmas came early seeing the notification pop up, you guys are doing an amazing job getting these uploaded & Ottie is the sweetest little videographer! 🥰🎄😘
💖💖💖
Honestly I LIIIIIIIVE for daily vlogger Ottilie! She’s so cute trying to hold the camera and I can’t help but laugh the whole time she has it😂😂
I love how alfie and zoe go "WoOWoo"
ottie with the camera was the cutest thing ever! loved the vlog as always 💖
Ottie’s filming and your reaction Zo, is literally how I pictured what your vlogs would be. It’s so cute. The both of ya. ❤
Ottie filming and saying ‘bye bye’ was the absolute cutest!💌
My 19 month old and I are really enjoying your vlogmas this year. She loves watching Ottie do baby stuff!
OMG! One of my favourite Vlogmas  I look forward to every year 💕 Ottie is just the cutest and adorable wee Lady 😍 Thank you so much for taking the time to do vlogmas this Year! Especially now that you're a busy mum, much appreciated 🤗 Keep smashing guys! Merry Christmas to you all, Much love from Scotland 🎄☃️❤ xxx
Alfie- Thank You for all your hard work editing these vlogs for us! My favorite time of the year!
Ottie filming is truly the purest thing. Also the tree decorating gives me such nostalgia of vlogmas like 5+ years ago when this house was still brand new
I always love the lights you use on your tree!! Are they linkable? Thank you! Have loved watching vlogmas for many years now and am also a parent of a toddler now so understand the chaos!
your vlogmas literally makes me feel so cozy, i love it so mush
Anyone else wave bye when the vlog ends? 😅😂
watching your vlogmas right before i have to go to work every day makes me feel just a lil more festive and in a better mood before i gotta face the day x
V❤❤️💕Allie thanks for editing Zoe am just loving the vlogs and Ottie ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
At the rate Ottie's handling the camera, she'll be a pro vlogger by this time next year xD
Alfie should make more editor notes, love the editing!
Ottie is the daughter of two vloggers I’m pretty sure she came out knowing how!!! She’s so cute!!! 😍🥰❤️
Ottie cam is amazing. My daughter used to run off with mine while recording. It was so funny.x
I am sooo happy Zoe's back doing vlogmas! It makes me feel so cosy and festive! Alfie is doing an amazing job editing, I have always loved Alfie's editing style anyway 👌🏻  You guys are making me so excited to one day have my own children and make them memories with them that I had as a kid! 🎄🎅❄️
Eltham is pronounced Elt-ham. Glad you enjoyed the lights at the palace.
Did you see centre parks with Gemma it was amazing, Ottie would love it as much as you 🤗, she also mentioned the book advent she would like to do for Noah next year. Your tree in the garden would look awesome with purple and white lights and some mushrooms to match . Christmas lights are everything I’m sitting with my tree lights on and it’s perfect. Zoe do you agree Cadbury have made a good job with the chocolates this year it’s easier to tell what they are 🤭🤣😂 Take care of each other xx x x
Your vlogmas’ always make me feel so happy and Christmassy! And what lovely memories you have captured with Ottie that you’ll be able to cherish and watch back in years to come 🤍🎄🫶🏼
just the cutest!! Been really enjoying your Vlogmas so far.. ottie is so cute 🥰🥰
A true family effort. Alfie: cameraman and editor. Zoe: lovely vlogger and hostess with the mostest. Ottie: vlogger in training and the cutest little mite ever.
Absolutely loving the family style Vlogmas!

Ottie a cute cameraperson
I'm starting to wonder whether this is vlogmas by Zoe or vlogmas by Ottie
These vlogs instantly get me into the Christmas spirit. Love them! 🎄
Watching Ottie play with the camera was too cute!!! Her ‘bye bye’ was adorable🥺❤️
Oh my goodness, she is just so precious!!!!

Can anyone tell me what song is playing at about 6:17 I’ve heard it so many times and I’ve searched everywhere as it sounds like a really good song but I can’t find it anywhere!!! If anyone could help me out that would be amazing
Question for Sunday? Did your mom move closer to be near ottie ? It seems she's there much more often
Ottie Decorating the Christmas tree it looks so super duper cute she just looks so cute ❤❤❤xxxxxxxx
I always mean to ask: where are you tree lights from? I’m American and I’ve never been able to find lights like yours in that garland style that twinkle like that but I love them!
I love the new camerawoman she's a cutie pie <3
Petition for Ottie to get her own clogging channel
We need a mark and Zoe Christmas vlogmas video
Watching both Zoe and Alfie be present and engaging parents to Ottie makes me happy. It kinda heals my inner child. What a blessed human xx
Ottie is just the CUTEST little thing!!!! It is SO lovely seeing her play with the camera!
