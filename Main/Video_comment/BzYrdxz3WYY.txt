If you enjoyed this video, please give it a THUMBS UP as it helps me in the YouTube algorithm! 😀 What store are you most excited to see deals from this week? 👇🏼 Comment below 👇🏼 UPDATE: Target has since corrected the ASUS pricing :(
Lol ouch he hates cricket. It's a definite addiction 🥰 hang in there it will pay off in the end
He didn't show game pass 3 months deal online
🤣😂🤣”I wouldn’t be such a tool’…thanks for the chuckle and all the entertaining and informative content 😎
Costco has that same Vizio Soundgarden system for $169.99. Tested it at Best buy and it sounds great!
Mario Kart live link is not working, maybe it’s just me.  No biggie, just wanted to let you know.
have watched all of your Black Friday videos ! I'm looking for an Epson eco tank printer. Any deals out there ?
Mario kart live sold out online and at any nearby Target so I looked around and found it at Walmart for $10 less. Who would’ve known that missing out on a deal would save me even more money.
Great video, any 43” TV deals?  Thanks again
Headed in for the air fryer and other in store only deals. Ill keep you posted 95603
Looking for a really good pet hair vacuum
what about any motorized cars for toddlers?
Im just here to learn more about target because Im a newbie customer rep here at the Philippines so I can literally learn how to assist my customer once I am at work❤️
Some pretty good deals! But I think I'll wait for the next blm protest and get 100% off
That Shark Pro Floor Cleaner is a good deal! Thank you!
I bought the steam mop and the XL air fryer! I had a monster steam mop, I’ve worn that thing out. This was such a great deal! Thanks!
Do you share the texting list?
My kids had a Cozy coupe and that was a big deal back then!    Their other ride on toys had  PETALS!  🧐
I plan to purchase the cricut do you have a link for credit otherwise I Will in store
Love your videos but help a fellow Ohioan out how about 1000tc sheets deals. Linens, are tops on my list.
Could you do a video for lap top computers with screens larger than 15.6"?
Is it for Australia?
BLACK FRIDAYS MATTER!
Ooh love these deals! Great video as always 👍
Any good sales on Gamepass Ultimate?
How are you gonna wear a bright pink shirt like it a day before Easter instead of nice fall colors appropriate to the day before Thanks giving.   Come on we know you don’t wear paints  At least try to stay festive
Anyone with a good idea for a gift for my mailman?  I got him a  thermos water bottle last year.
3:22  8:36
I can't find the Black Friday store you showed a Samsung self vacuum....Help!
Got the Kitchen Aid - used your link - thank you!!
That Element 65 inch roku TV isn't $299 its listed for $449 from $629. So I'm not sure where that came from.
Cricut 2 $149 at Michaels but better to invest in new model Cricut 3 which is why the 2 is so cheap.
Have you found any deals for the Breville smart oven air fryer pro? It's the bigger when it's normally $399.
You send it India
Another great plan!  Thanks Matt!
Honest Thank you 🙏🏼 soooooo much for doing the shop walking for me! Really appreciate it!
Ironically You sell yourself short re:your wife, because You make laugh 😂 so much I’m sure you entertain her much more than any machine 😉
does the i pad air gen 4 have any sales?
I’m not a techie person, however the SoundBars are worth every dollar.
Have you seen any Epson EcoTank printers that are great deals
Anyhow…. Hehehehe Thank you so much!!!
So HAPPY I found you on YouTube. I was sad that the mixer was sold out but I did get the sound bar. I've been needing one for years. Hope my little purchase through your video helps fatten your wallet. I'll keep my eyes on you for future deals!
I just visited the Target website.  All colors of the Kitchen Aid 5-quart stand mixer are OUT OF STOCK‼️  😡
Mario kart live best deal is in Walmart . For 50$
any good deal on Tiles Tracker?
Wait the Vizio 2.1 your talking about is $129 online ? And it’s just one speaker and subwoofer. The one your talking about is the $199 Vizio v series 5.1 ?
I find your videos very informative. And I enjoyed them very much. I hope you have a very happy Thanksgiving
Can I order the air fryer now? And get it at the sale price? Last year I tried that on Amazon and I didn’t get that ring doorbell and free Echo Dot for $49 they charged me 98.
Hi Deal Guy, I’ve been watching your Black Friday videos for a few years now, and have found your contents helpful and enjoyable.   I would like to request for more video game contents as I’ve recently invested in PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, thanks!!
So much to push your charge card to the limit checking account nothing in it.
are these 'in store' items, or can you get them on line for the same price
Question: for the Bose headphones 🎧, are they any cheaper anywhere else?  Or is that the best price you’ve seen so far??  Please and thank you 😊
Lol gas is $3.30 by me
WOW 🤩. Magnificent holiday shopping. Truly thank you for another overwhelming shopping spree. We are all so grateful for your breathtaking shopping
Raced over to Target in tax free NH and picked up the Oculus Quest 2! Have wanted one for months but could never justify the price tag! I am psyched to get it for $299 (well actually $249 with the gift card) 🤩🤩🤩 Thank you Matt! Love your infectious energy 😍😍
Will the M8crosoft Surface laptop be on sale?
My favorite YouTuber ,thank you for making shopping fun with such great deal findings ,your humor takes the videos to another level  😂🤣👍, small request could possibly talk Best Pc monitor deals for black Friday , kids driving me crazy about pc monitor
Do you think the Black Friday deals for the Bose quietcomfort noise cancelling earbud, not the headphones, is a good deal? It's currently promoted at $199 for black friday. Do you think it will go any lower?
Thank you for the great deals. I don't believe the HP laptop is touchscreen though.
Hello Matt, where can I find the best tablet deals please? thanks so much!
Thank you Matt! Your awesome !
Lol I’m California ONE gas tank will run you $70
Would love to know if the Instant Pot 3qt will be on sale anywhere?
I would like to se anything with phones Any thing on nest thermostats
Christmas trees
Ugh, Target online says the element tv is $450 for me. I wonder if this price will change on Thursday
I've thought about the Ring but after the fact that he sits on shark tank and gives a thumbs down to everyone that tries to get someone to help with their invention and it wasn't that long ago they gave him the same thing now he's giving them the thumbs down no thanks.
I'm so excited about this Cricut ! The Walmart bundle is going for $225 here on Knoxville
For crying outloud.  Why the hell are retailers still calling it "black Friday sales" if it's been going on for weeks already & not after Thanksgiving?
Boy, did Target screw up their ad with the 65" for $299.99 on the front page.
I need a wireless headset with microphone. It needs to come with a plug (like a wireless mouse), because I have an old computer with zero Bluetooth. I work from home, it would be much appreciated!   I also need a desk and chair.
Thank you!
Did they fix the laptop typo???
Just bought the kitchen aid mixer Take advantage of red card discount and if your new to red card you get $40 off a future purchase
I went to get the Apple Watch and it says “tomorrow” and there is an error when I try to put it in my cart.
Any recommendations for a 55" Roku TV this black friday?
Hi, I am still looking for an XBox X!  Have you seen them anywhere?  I don't mean the XBox S!
We bought (and already love) the Shark steam mop and the Cricut Explorer Air 2.  At least we were already in the market for the Cricut.  :). Before Friday we're going to use that $30 gift card to get some 30%-off Cricut accessories.
Just found your channel for the first time and I have to say your enthusiasm is infectious! Thank you for the effort that you put into these videos!
Matt- the sign for Frozen dolls says buy 2 get one free
I would like to see more kitchen gadgets highlighted if possible! I am personally looking for a Nespresso machine 👀👀👀
Thanks!
I need the Roomba ❤️
Can you find the best Deals for a Cricut Or Silhouette cutting machines? Target having the gift card and accessories on sale make it one of the better deals out there & I did not know that they were offering such a deal.
Hey Matt, thank you as always for these Videos! Do you plan on doing a video on the kids volt rides, the BMW cutie in this one is a great deal but hubby won't budge on the make lol. I noticed a bunch doubled in price last week and made me a little sad. Anyways thank you so much, hope you aren't working to hard and getting time to spend with the family.
Hi Deal Guy You are doing a great job!!
The 65” TV when is it available?
I picked up the Visio sound bar that was $49.99. It's berger for the bedroom. Gives better sound than speakers from the TV and is not overpowering and bulky. Fits nicely under the TV.
who reads this, be happy and healthy <3 <3
Can you tell me iphone deal unlocked version black Friday
Can you list the real times some stores actually start their Black Friday sales online.  Just like Costco, Sam s , Walmart and target. Too confusing as to when they actually start.  Thanks Matt
While I do enjoy your channel I have difficulty with the way you move the camera around.  Moving the camera around isn’t a problem if it is done more smoothly.   It’s a problem when you move it continuously and so fast causing motion issues such a vertigo and headache for some of us.
Looking for a deal( less than $99 on Apple mini speakers). Thanks for your help
Hey deal guy! Are there any home security cameras/systems gonna be on sale for Black Friday/cyber Monday?
Anyone know of any deals on the Munchkin Bluetooth Enabled Lightweight Baby Swing?
What about Samsung TABLETS? Who has the best deal this year?
you must love thanksgiving week lol
Do you know if the nintendo switch lite will be on sale anywhere for black friday?
Matt, any Vitamix deals please?
Hi I'm looking to purchase a phone on sale, it seems like all the sales are on the phone that just came out. I wanted the note 20 ultra
👍👍
Target fixed the Asus laptop price.
How come you did not add the ninja foodi 5 in 1 grill air fryer from 230 usd to 169.99 usd ???????
Could really benefit from a Top 10 laptop, desktop, and all in one video or two!
Hey Matt these are some amazing deep deals everyone I know wants an air fryer and this is the best price I’ve seen!!  You’re truly a Deal Guru and I appreciate everything you do for us, your videos are concise and entertaining!!!! Most of all your reviews are spot on!  Making you the Deal Guru 💕🤗
@The Deal Guy    Could you please find Black Friday deals on Automatic Massaging Chairs, Thanks!
I’m desperate to find a PS5!!! I do not need a huge deal on price but I need a console under the tree this year. It is literally the only item on my twins list.
Looking for a modem with voice. Can you find one.
They have corrected the price on the Asus laptop.
Looking to buy 2 or 3 screens for our store marketing. How is that Element 65" - Im a little concerned about Element brand longevity, and also not buying it from Costco. Thanks for feedback!!
⭐️You work so hard getting us the deals!  I like how you even personalize some of the deals!   🤣👍👏The humor is a PLUS+…THANK YOU!
What’s your phone number for the deals?
Purchased the floor steamer while watching videos. Hoping it will clean my wood floors better than a mop.
I'd stay away from the LG tv's - the best discount in the world won't make up for their slow, dysfunctional, and sometimes non-functional smart features.  We had to get a Roku for our 'smart' LG just to get some apps that LG can't/won't carry.
Thanks Matt!
mixer is a great deal, I've had one for over 20 years, its a work horse. Don't forget EVERYONE, find a charity that is giving to children this year=toys from santa! I know its been a tough year, but our police and fireman work very hard to make sure kids in America get a present or two, do your share and contribute, I'm sure those 2 for 1 deals would be great deals for this years christmas gifts to children who parents can barely afford the food for dinner.   I'm sure local charities, churches, first responders are having gift contributions accepted, please investigate.  Blessings.
Can you do a review on how to find deals using brickseek?
Was at Target yesterday and forgot to get the headphones…guess I’ll have to go back :)
Great video!
Did you say 3 $50 gift cards on oculus? I see only 1 on target website
Love your content helps a lot!!! I’m looking for any PS5 deals idk if there will be any but I’m looking hard!
I like how you just get to it.
Thank you! I got the shark mop.
Thanks so much.
If you come across the Xbox One please mention.
Hi! Can you tell me some of the best deals anywhere on vacuums, toasters, air fryers? Highly interested in learning about any kind of home goods deals. Thank you in advance!!:)
Any good deals for an Apple Watch?
I think google and Alias tracking an listing an watching us. I will not buy.
Those robo vacuum just can’t hold enough dirt for a room
I have the oldest shark and still love it
What about iphone deals Mr. The Deal Guy??
Yeah I wouldn't trust a 130 laptop idc who made it.
I bought the beat solos for 99 at target 2 weeks ago. I love them. Great sound and comfy on my small head.
BE AWARE: Target is now a Market Place (aka: TargetPlus Partner). What that means is they list products that are sold and fulfilled by other companies. You are covered by Target policies, however, delivery timeframes and the quality of delivery may be impacted. And No in-store pick up on these items. Make sure you keep all receipts and emails.
I work at target and those element TVs sold out by 3pm
They fixed the laptop price....
Man Target is really struggling to give away books, dvds, and cds (buy 2 get 1 free)... everything is digital, even video games 😅🤷🏼‍♂️
THANKS for all your hard work. I'm looking for the best deal on a Nintendo switch lite?
What is the best time to buy airpods pro?
I went target Black Friday for the Nintendo Switch when I got there they were sold out
I need a deal on an Xbox X!  Help

I absolutely love your videos and all the information you give on all of the products you review and suggest. If you know of any Black Friday deals on the IPad Air please let me know please!! I’m trying to get it as a gift for a family member and trying to see if there are any places that are running deals on them. Thanks so much!!!
I need the Beatles art Lego can you find it
Just before you said “I’m jealous…..” regarding kids toys, the Mercedes Benz vehicle I was thinking the same wording, so weird.
I love Target, thanks for the video, Matt!! 💕
I scored the Dyson V8 vacuum and with my REDcard I was able to get that 5% discount an additional $12 off!! Thank you Matt, always  enjoy your videos 🤗
What about the amazon Black Friday deals.  Thanks for doing great videos! 😜
What about Google chromecast with YouTube tv
Could you please let us know if there are any good appliances deals? My dryer hasn't worked in a year and now my refrigerator is failing. Hope i can score black Friday or cyber Monday
That target laptop at the very top right of page. Hp touch screen for under $300. I copped it at 7:45 am. I just locked in a merry Christmas.
I grabbed the kitchen aid- thank you. I’m looking for a lap seatbelt car seat. Have you seen any sales?
Roomba GARBAGE! Dyson GARBAGE!  SHARK ALL DAY BABAY! CHOMP CHOMP!
I have the notifications turned on but I don't get them. I don't get it...and you're not the only one. You do come in my feed so that does help. 😊😊

I love your energy and your videos ❤️
Thanks man 👋🏽 . I just picked up the wireless headphones for a family member for the upcoming holidays 😃
Ps5 deals please
Thanks just ordered the kitchen aid mixer. Screaming deal.
As always you rock and thank you!
I love your videos, but please PLEASE could you slow down just a bit? I guess I am old after all cause it’s very hard to keep up! 😀
I've been looking everywhere for a good black friday deal for the nintendo switch and the nintendo switch lite! Would love it if you could find any good deals involving those!
Hey Matt, Have you seen any good deals for those outdoor gas fired pizza ovens? The brand ooni makes a popular one.
These deals are amazing!
Mr Deals Guy. Is black friday worth it? Or is there better deals through out the year? Thank you for giving us the info.
I always appreciate your videos. You’re doing all the work!
I love this guys energy. 😊
Can you do a best buy black Friday video?
Thank you..as always you're the best. Shared with EVERYONE I KNOW!!
I enjoy your videos & tips. I used your link to purchase the Kitchen Aid stand mixer from target & ended up grabbing the mini food processor in the matching color! Thanks!
I thought they were called L. O. L. Dolls ( saying each letter) Have I been wrong this whole time?😩
I scored the roomba for 150! With my red card and seasonal job discount. I've been wanting one since I got my condo. Also an added tip top any registry people combine these offers with any coupons plus redcard plus circle offers!!!
Target yay!! Awesome deals!! Got to show hubby!! 🏃🏃🏃
I would love an apple products video, especially the IPad Pro.
You read my earlier request for an iRoomba. thank you! Happy thanksgiving to your sweet family!
LOVE your reviews! Thanks for the great Black Friday head’s up
Hey Deal guy, I need a BF microwave oven deal.
magicbullet mini please and dont you think prices are cheaper on cyber Monday?
Interesting video...any boy toys anywhere ages 8 and 10
Got your text this morning and RAN to the one and only Target in my area but they were already out of the Kitchenaid Mixer … however it was still available online and in the color I wanted (3 colors were already sold out)! I’m beyond thrilled as have wanted this for years and Target is not charging for shipping!!!!! THANK YOU MATT!! Had it not been for your text I may have missed out!! I’ve seen the same mixer at Sam’s for $349 for awhile but even that was too much. $219 was too great a deal to pass up. God bless!!!!
Great information, thanks for sharing.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just Love this channel😍 Great deals at target, my son loves video games and xbox gift cards🎅     Thank you for the deals ❤🙏🕊 Your so funny 😂
Let’s help him get to 2 million 👍🏼
I think target gets it for the money this year.   Everyone is barley coming back from being unemployed and we need deals
I just bought the instant pot 6qt crisp combo 11 in 1 for $99.99 😃😃
Target is Extremely Expensive this year. Well for the Adults anyway. LOL
If we only had stimulus checks to purchase some of these items .
Except I refuse to shop at Target.
Tv 70 inch or higher and stand mixer
Just a tip when it comes to gaming laptops. Always a good idea to hear what kind of Nvidia card the gaming laptop has. For example, I wouldn't think too much if it was a RTX 3050 laptop, but if I heard it was a RTX 3060  or higher laptop, that would definitely get my attention.
I work at target the deals is pretty good I think we will be very busy on black Friday…
Pokémon cards
Woot!  Just grabbed the 70" TV, thank you!  I am thinking of going back for the mixer because that's the lowest I've seen it!  Thanks again and LOVE your videos!
What about Kohl’s?
Any chance the north face and Nike are having Black Friday sale
HOLY MOLY O JUST BOUGHT A LAPTOP FOR $171.37  I PICK IT UP TOMORROW!!  TYTUTUTYTYTUTUTYTYTU!! U SOOOOOOOOOO 🤘🤘🤘!!!!
Just ordered the KitchenAid mixer. Thank you. Red was sold out (boo! Since most of my kitchenware is copper or red) so I decided to try ice blue. Thank you. I wouldn't have seen it at this great price if I didn't watch you!
Great info!!!  Thanks! ♥️💚🎄💚♥️
Thank you, Matt!! 🤗 Yes, I have a recommendation. Any Black Friday sales for curtains? A friend is seeking good quality with good bang for the bucks. 😊
Hi Mr.Deal Guy...can you please please help me find the best deal for an Instant Pot!   Please 🥺
Thanks, great deals!
👍👍👏👏👏
It's a little niche, but I was wondering if there were any deals on digital storage such as memory cards, external hard drives, or something similar. It would be greatly appreciated
I wouldn't shop at Target if they were giving them away.
Oh oh
Any good deals on home security system
Looking for a tv Black Friday deal
of course, the 65" Element TV for $299 is sold out.  They probably had 2
I am looking for two 32" tv's. Anybody selling little ones fir Black Friday?📺
We love you to Merry Christmas to you and your family
I just bought the Kitchenaid mixer 2 weeks ago at the same price. I’ve been wanting that color for years
I don't know how much I want some of these things until you show them to me! Stop it! LOL 🙃
I dont see the laptop for $129.00
Do we know what times the sales will start?
Looking for Sonos stuff
Will you please do a video of stores that are worth actually going to in person on Black Friday? Thank you.
this vid was great i like the price pop ups at the bottom
I've noticed sometimes you make deals better than they seem. Why did you show the renewed headphones off Amazon when they sell new ones for the same price as target
Beware the Cricut box said it's a #2, which is the older model. There is now a explore and maker 3 out.
Best buy also has the kitchen aid mixer for $219.99 if you want more color options
I just love how enthusiastic you are at all times, thank you for all the good stuff you bring us‼️❤
I am interested in the best deal on a tablet.  Thanks for finding us the best deals!

Thank you. I have been in the market for a sound  bar, but never did it. I used your link and will be picking up in about 2 hours. thanks.
My dishwasher just went out any sales on Dishwashers?💥💥💥💥💣💣💣
I saw this video and I ran right out and bought a Kitchen Aid mixer. At over $200.00 off, it's a great deal and I've always wanted one. Thank you.
Loved the enthusiasm in the opening of this video but I did have my volume on max and you scared my cat xD!!
Please share microwave over the counter deals
#7 😄
Still looking for a printer. Saw one at Walmat for $30? Didn't know if it was p.o.s. or not, figured you would not steer me wrong.  Target shelves were empty of Hot Wheels  blue card (mainline) cars. great stocking stufferrs, but nope, not there, nor at Walmart.  Did I see that right? a 65" tv for $300?  OMG!!!
Security cameras
Looks like target already corrected the laptop price 😟
Cool video thanks.
Any gaming pc deals?
Is there any Black Friday deals to buy Microsoft office home and student 2021?
In my day, we had pedal cars!
Heads up peeps. Walmart is getting stricter on their price match. They wouldn't even price match their own online prices from the app. Not third party app prices.
You better read that fine print
Great target black Fri video! Love ya thank you for all your hard work you put in for us!!
Need a top 10 for Bluetooth speakers
Thanks Matt! I wasn't planning on buying a new laptop right now, but since I've needed one for ages... Thinking I might just go for it! Thanks for all you do and happy holidays to you and your family! ❤️
Went in store for the video game deal..... Didn't exist :'(
Awwwww nice pink shirt looks good ! 👏🏼💜
Great videos!
The asus laptop is coming up as $160 for me, might’ve bought it for $130 as a spare for traveling
Hey Matt looking for 2 things.  A multi-headset (wireless) that can connect to a TV, and good deals on Android compatible smart watches.
🌞
Hi, I joined your group for the saving deals - thanks!  Was wondering are there any deals on headphones or ear buds that help you hear the volume louder on your TV and not drive others craz?  Thanks  Love you too!
What about espresso machines? Specifically breville
I own the rose gold Samsung galaxy buds live or what we all started calling them Samsung beans lol. They're my everyday go to buds. It Still blows my mind the things u can do with them and how long they last. Plus the sound is next level amazing! My fave thing is if ur recording audio or recording video with audio u can use the buds as mics or pick up specific sounds. It's wild the endless possibilities they have. Ur gonna love them. Oh and I love that I can charge them by laying them on the back of my Samsung note 20 ultra if I'm on the go.
Looking to see what deals LG has on TV’s and any laptops

Awww yes! I want the cricut!

Hey
Thank you . I just bought a IRobot
One thing to consider as well is to check the price tag on thd shelf as today I scored a DVD box set that scanned in at $54.99 for $31.99 because the shelf tag was wrong.  When combined as part of the sale, I only paid $24.99 for the set, $30 off!
Thanks Matt! Got the shark steam mop and two Xbox live gift cards. The cards were marked 44 and change for a 3 month subscription and rang up at 24 and change! Woohoo!!

Thank you for mentioning Oculus
Excellent job!! Thank you
Going to recommend the laptop to my wife she needs another cpu for school an d I think that will check all the bones
You have lots of other talents. You're not a tool. We love you!
Thanks man! Just grabbed the sound bar. Great reviews. You're the best! Happy Thanksgiving!
I woke up 2am, 3am, 4am.. waiting for target app to update with the gift card to get the oculus deal.  Success!!
I just placed my order for the Shark steam mop 😊. I hope it works well🤞
Timely and as always a fun experience.  Love your energy Matt...now I HAVE TO go to Target.  👍
👏
Thanks for this! I just wish my wallet could afford all these great deals!
Actually it said buy 2, get 1 on the sign with the frozen toys
This is a personal question but may I know where your local Target is? There's a couple of CDs and books on the shelf that I want but they're not available at my local Target store 😢
I always answer that I love you, too, Matt!🙂
I have four granddaughters, and in the next month, I will have the first grandson. I definitely will buy the Mercedes Benz for him😎
I love you too!
LOL ! Target bait and switch on Element 65 inch TVs.  My Target only had 4 of them and now have others listed at 449. Somebody ordered one online and Target confirmed it was ready to pick up and than they cancelled his order on him according to twitter. A real turn off on Target.
Show us the BF Apple products!
Great and informative. Keep up the good work!!
Any deals on Samsung watches?
I might need to check out the books and movies! Thanks for doing this!!!
Hi Matt, I just subscribed to your channel. Did I miss any great sales for tablets?
My wife enjoys the Cricket more than her marriage 😂
You crack me up!!
Great deals & even better presentation!  I thoroughly enjoy watching your videos- we’re still trying to locate a PS5 for our son, which seems elusive…. Thanks for the great content
Amazon is doing the same deal for Oculus

2:36 (the Dyson) "... reduced from it's ridiculous list price of $380."  Bahaha!  Tell it like it is!!!
Great job 👍👍
Do you have any thoughts on The All in One Pan?
Oh I need that Mixer!!
Thanks Matt! Don't forget everyone should know the government is phasing out 3G in 2022. Any 3G devices will no longer work even for 911. They are forcing us once again. Bad timing for people who don't have the money for a brand new expensive device. Even Lifeline services won't work is what I understand.🙏😶
Costcos ninja all in one with thermometer is 120 dollars less on Costco than it is on amazon.
ANY MULTI SPEAKER HOME THEATER SYSTEM WITH GOOD DEALS YOU RECCOMMEND?
Looking for an air purification unit. Great job!

Are you in Ohio? When I saw your phone number-My family have that code!!! I am from Ohio live in Georgia now!!! Don’t miss the cold and snow!! Love ya!! Judy
Thank you for the target Black Friday deals. I noted down some deals you mentioned. Btw looking for theragun deal, do you have any recommendations? TIA
Thank you so much for putting this video together! I was able to snag some great deals on some Christmas gifts!
Keep pumping this out ❤️❤️
Yeah that Xbox pass is a great deal!!! 3 months plus your kid gets a bunch more on the game, parents if your kid plays fortnite you will want the 3month Xbox game pass gold for 24.99!!!
I love your enthusiasm and humor. You entertain while you pass on great deals! My wife has now started watching you too! Thanks!
I bought the Sony headphones last year. I love them. Still use them.
Target must watch your videos because they already corrected the price on the Asus laptop. 🙂
Your garage sales must be epic neighborhood events!  🤣
I am looking for a Cricut Joy. Do you know who has them at a decent price?
Would love it if you went 10 - 1 instead of 1 - 10
Love how you dress so sharp and so neat great show
Target changed the price on laptop real quick
Cricut
Circuit, what is it?
Love this!! Thank you!!! Free tip for you, parent to parent….parent of girls to parent of girl; the dolls are pronounced L-O-L (el-oh-el)……..I don’t want to you EVER be trapped in public mispronouncing in front of your daughter & possible friends, therefore producing an “embarrassing” moment for said daughter. We must appear to be in the know at all times as parents…..cool points (with the kids) acquire faster when we help each other out. 🤣  Unless you are like my husband…who loves to produce the embarrassing moments on purpose….with the goal of making others laugh, thus acquiring “different” cool points…..disregard message if this is the case and carry on with your good work. ❤️🤣
Great video. I'm trying to find a good tablet however, I end up getting confused. Lol
Any deals on JBl Bluetooth speakers
Need good deal on 49 inch tv
Targets movie section sucks now. That's not even huge. Go back 10 years ago and compare this to that. Huge difference. And please no one buy into that cheap 4k TV. It's not even a good name brand TV. Very cheap TV.
Need deal for wd black 850 ssd 2TB.
Element TV sucks
Love your videos!
Neopets Neocash cards not Newcastle
Thank you for your hard work. I always enjoy your videos. I've been missing the food recommendations in your past home improvement store videos 🤣. If you see any Osmo educational systems for  fire tablets on sale, I would love to know about it. 😁
You said the Frozen toys were buy 1 get 1 50% off, at time stamp 4:20 the sign says bogo.
Do you think this is going to be the best deal around on a steam mop?  I've been wanting one for awhile and have been waiting for black friday to get one.
Thank you for this video!
I enjoyed this video...thanks for the deals
Have  you or anybody else tried the air fryer out?
Thanks, Matt! Any deals on weighted blankets?

What would we do without you?!
Are there any Sonos sales somewhere I can't find
You rock Deal Guy! I have been looking for the Kitchenaid Mixer!!! So glad I check your videos faithfully!  YOU ARE APPRECIATED!!
Thank you so much Matt!  All these deals are fantastic.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I was wondering if you have any inside deals on the craft stores?  Michael’s, Hobby Lobby, etc. My mom is huge on these stores and find some things there would be great to take her so she can get what she needs
Just an FYI, individual Target stores do not have to match the online website pricing. Neither of the 2 Targets in my area will match the online prices, I’ve tried. It was explained to me that individual Targets have the ability to decide if they will match online pricing, if different than in store pricing, or not.
Is the Nintendo Switch: Animal Crossings Special Edition for $299 a great deal?  Seems like it is but I don’t know much about the Switch. My kids are just old enough for a console.
Many thanks for your Insider Texting, Matt! You keep us up to date with amazing deals that are currently available, without texting too much. You are so good to us! We love you, too, Matt! 💜
Make your own Frozen toy! Grab last year's and put it in the freezer.

Hi Matt, thanks for keeping us informed. Please let us know if you see any good deals on the Rubbermaid Easy Find Lids bundles in red. I usually pick them up at Walmart during this time for less than 10 bucks but I’ve only seen them in green.
Some great deals. Can you look for best price on dyson v10, if possible. I’m so excited for your videos with all the great deals this week!!
My husband and I rely on you to give us good recommendations! So far you haven’t steered us wrong!💕 And if I can get my husband to watch ANYONE on YouTube…it’s you! Happy Thanksgiving to You and Your Lovely Family!
Hi Matt! From Massachusetts.
Quite often if you were shopping in store you can scan your item that you're going to purchase with the Target app and get it at a lower price as Matt said but I do it quite often with things like toys because they consider the website different than in store. They will always price match the website in store.
Looking forward to all the videos for black Friday this year..  Hopefully this will be the best one ever.  Thank you for always helping us..
Odd thing to say about the Cricut there...
11” Android Touch pads
So the frozen toys are buy 1 get 1 or buy 2 get 1? The sign has buy 2 get 1.
your videos are great... did you just call yourself a tool lmfao i'm LOL'ing :) happy shopping!!
Thanks for telling us about all the deals Matt! Definitely good deals!
Hi Matt another fantastic video 👍🏻‼️ love to your family 😊

Can you do a Walmart Black Friday tutorial like this one ?
Looking for Milwaukee battery tool sets for Black Friday, specifically the mini driver.  Who has this, Matt?
Dang. I thought the deals weren't going live yet so I missed out on the 65" TV for $299. My parents really need a bigger tv because of my dad's vision loss. Definitely let us know if any other great tv deals pop up!
I saw that KitchenAid stand mixer BF deal in-store yesterday. Amazing! If I didn't already have my mom's KA mixer 💖, I'd totally take advantage of that great price.  Thanks, Matt, for the deals info! I love, love, love Target.
Well done sir, well done. I can’t wait to see what else you have coming up on your next video. 👍
I just paid 24 bucks for a scooter. It may not be top of the line Razor but its still a scooter. Thanks for sharing
THK U AGAIN FOR GREAT HOLIDAY SHOPPING INFO‼️❤
Hi Matt - Great video.  Target looks like they are jumping into the holiday season with both feet.  I am looking for an Instapot or Cosori Air Fryer.  The one you showed is a great price, but I don't have that much room on my counter, so I need a smaller profile and both of these have gotten great reviews.  Thanks for all your hard work and keep the deals coming.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Love PegEgg
Me & my family members enjoy your site & really appreciate what u do I have gotten some nice savings because of your efforts and I thank you!!!!❤

Hey Matt, any chance you could ad BJ's to your warehouse club repertoire?
We are down for the sound bar for sure. The tv on the dining room just blares the sound out the back since there is no wall behind it.  That Vizio will solve the problem at a great price.  Have a great day Matt and Super Thanks

Looking for a deal on August Wifi Lock. You have any insights on this?
Thanks Matt, just a request- can you please make a video on iPhones, who’s selling the cheapest. Especially iPhone 12s. To my knowledge Walmart seems good right now, 12 mini is for $299 with straight talk. Let us know if you know any better price. Thanks
Keeping my fingers crossed for any good mattresses on sale, and watching out for all cleaning products and if any pet products pop up. 🤞🏻
Thank you so much! I’d love to stay & chat but I have to go fill my cart with crap I don’t need- but, want. Lol. Thanks for the bday text as well! I’m swimming in Amazon gift cards haha
Is the google doorbell comparable or b better than the ring?
Almost tempted at the price on that Kitchen Aid to get another one! Ha! What a deal! I’m on the fence with the Cricut still, but that price is excellent! What other things do you need to buy with it? I may buy myself a present this year.  That mis-print price on that lap top looks like a fabulous deal, but what do you think about it Matt?  As always thank you for all you do to get us the best deals!
Great video, thank you.
So I asked you about the Target Pyrex 22 piece glass set. You listed it as $10 around 2:20 pm. I looked at it right away and it was 19.99. I never saw $10. Now it is 49.99. 😮
These videos always perk me up always excited to see new deals and look forward to seeing what's next keep these videos coming much appreciated
Hi! Thanks for the heads up on the sales! I just wanted to point out the LOL dolls you showed the sign says Buy 2 Get 1 free not BOGO just so you know 🙂

I have to factor in if its worth the 38 mile drive one way or the 39 mile in the other lol! 🤗 ( Be nice to your wife sir-crafting is special.)
Will Dell be offering any specials on their XP line? Also curious about any BF Apple specials.
Xbox and PS5 still extremely hard to come by which is a shame
Great deals#!!!😃😃😃
Hi, I’ll looking for a wireless gaming headset (XBox one) for my 10 yr old nephew any suggestions?
Hey Matt, love your videos!  Do you know of any baby item deals-clothing, furniture, necessities, etc?
Hubby and I have limited our spending to $100 a piece for Christmas since we are deep in home renovations! He’s such a tech freak…can you give me your recommendations for Black Friday for your Top 10 Black Friday tech gifts for $100 and under?   Love you videos!! I have scored some great items at awesome prices !!
I was wondering if there is a rely good laptop for a kid going into High School?  Also, any deals on a stove for the kitchen?
Idk about those Galaxy buds aesthetics lmao, they kinda look like beans lol. The color looks really nice tho haha
I’ve recently shared your content with my husband and he appreciates your enthusiasm and humor. He says you make shopping fun! It’s not great for our bank accounts if we both love you, but that’s the way it goes I guess!
😃
Hey Matt from yesterday’s text message deal of pyrex set for $10 price was not there, Was it limited time deal or is it going to come later on?
Wow, the gift card deal!
Thank You Matt for all of the research you do!! Now I have to shopping at my favorite store now!
Hey Matt! Love the channel and we watch all the time. Have you seen any deals at Target or elsewhere for high quality baby monitors? Thanks in advance!!

How about any power wheels Black Friday deals?is there any out there?
Hey Matt! What is the app you use to text everyone your deals? My husband needs something like that to send our his daily scriptures. His list of interested people is growing. Thank you! Jennie Hrdlicka
You should've mentioned their price match policy. Best Buy sells many movies for $9.99. Combine the price match with the b2g1 deal, and you'll have 3 movies for $20.
The Apple Pencil 2 is a great deal at 99.  Usually 129.00
Hi my name is PJ I love watching your videos I was wondering if you could do a few for Canadian on line shopping sites  some cheap like wish some more expensive but in Canadian dollars.   That's actually in Canadian dollars. Not just show Canadian prices and then convert to US dollars If you don't want to can you suggest somebody that does one that is honest like you are?  Thank you
Target Time!!
Img I wanted to buy a shark steam mop!!!! Yay!!! Thanks Matt! I had one years ago then it broke’

You went through the gift cards so quickly (as worth everything else) but I didn’t see them listed below. Can you list them or say where in the video you talk about them?
I might have to make my way over to the Bougie Walmart. 😂
Thanks!  Any lines on a HomePod mini discount?
Love your enthusiasm! Thanks for all the work. Looking for TV'S. So thanks for the updates. You Rock!🤘🏻😎🤘🏻
Good Morning Matt…..Love the Videos. Happy Holidays to you and your family!
Is it pronounced “Lole Surprise” or  “L-O-L Surprise”? I don’t want to buy it and be the dorky uncle that doesn’t know what it’s called.
Toys
Target….they play dirty! Their customer service SUCKS! You don’t get to talk to anyone in America & they do sheisty things, even while on the phone, so before u hang up, they’re already taken things into their own hands despite what they might tell u. NEVER AGAIN, TARGET! U can’t GIVE OR PAY ME, to shop Target!!
I’d love if you found the best deal on a Ninja CM401 specialty coffee maker! Or to hear your opinion if it’s something you’ve tried. I’ve been eyeing it but hesitant to spend so much.
Looking for a reasonable price on an iPad for granddaughter
Saw this ad leaked last week, about a day and a half AFTER I ordered the Ninja coffee bar at full price. Going in for a price adjustment today.
