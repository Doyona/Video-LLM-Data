When we finished the kitchen we literally had zero words except “so nice” HAHA…forgive us for not being as descriptive as normal but we just don’t have the words. As you know, there’s been so much work to get to this point so to finally have this space where we can make a nice meal together is really just everything. Also, just wanted to say a quick thank you to each and every one of you who have shared our videos with your friends and family as well as on social media…because of you our last 2 videos we’re featured on the trending page, which is a really big deal especially for a channel like ours. This community means more to us than we could ever possibly say…let us know what you thought of the build, can’t wait for next week! 💛
that cat! lol  I love your dome--I loved Buckminster Fuller   I lived 3 months in a 1-room adobe and straw bale house in the canyon in southern CA
Wondering why you cut the end of the counter off…never to much counter space. ❤ you guys
I am obsessed. It's so hard no not go rip out and remodel my kitchen right now this is such a bad channel for me to watch lol
I just love little Lilly!!! 😍
OH MY GOD, THE TOTE BATHTUB CLIP MAKES ME LAUGH SO HARD!!! 🤭😆🤣🤣😆
You guys have the best work shorts😍
❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈😘😘😘👌🙏
I love your channel! You make me know that I can do anything I put my mind to!
nice work guys
Ummm I feel cheap.. 😂🤣
I just found your videos tonight and you are both lovely! Thank you for sharing your home, and projects, and fur kids…what a nice life you are creating 💕
** (As I’m marathoning, I don’t know what you’ve done ahead 😉)
Have you thought about building your bedroom up inside the dome?
I feels cheap is catch phrase 🤪
I can't believe I just recently discovered you!!!  Always the optisimist** on the upside at least I can binge watch you.  and yes, you are bingeworthy!  PS I am actually heavily considering a geodesic dome for a property I buy in upper peninsula Michigan!  you inspire me XOXO
I’ve just subbed, and am catching up on some old blogs , enjoying, that’s guys!  All the best Jules
That clip of Todd in the tote taking a bath is hilarious!  I must go back and find that video!
You guys have came so far from when you first started and are doing a great job it's so motivational
I love your videos! You kitchen island, 17:14 - ive never seen such a small version AND able to hand barstools under. What brand is it? Love your interior! It's so well put together!
_so good_
Love this. So funny I have already watched the current videos but I had to go back and watch the journey from the beginning. Still love these moments for you both as much as the first time around
IKEA? You guys have my complete admiration. If…I had ikea cabinets their would have been a huge bonfire in the backyard! LOL anything we buy from ikea my wife puts together! My son who is an engineer won’t go near IKEA flat pack anything. I’m such a fan of your show ! We’re thinking about an off grid getaway and your show is just awesome !
Just found you guys and I just love you guys.  Your home is beautiful!  The animals are soooo cute!  Best of luck!
Here is 2 absolutely amazingly awesome dads to their 3 x 4 leged than anyone that i have ever met
You two are amazing.  It’s so nice 😉👍 really
Where are you Todd and Tyler’s and most importantly are you two ok? I’m worrying about you, hope to see you soon!!! 😊
Dear Tyler and Todd. I am from South Africa and let me tell you I can't wait for your sessions on ytube. Hope you are both doing great. Keep strong and remember you are both great individuals. Big hugs. Ronel Heydenrych
What's the energy efficiency class of such a dome? I see snow there, so it shouldn't be that bad.
I love you guys
Your counter top is really pretty.
Your counter top is really pretty.
I have that sink from IKEA.
Because I’m Swedish I love that you use IKEA a lot. ❤️
I love the way they look at each other  when the other is talking!
Where did you get your gorgeous island from? 😍 I loooove that it’s wood with steel and the size is amazing for smaller spaces! (I’d buy it!) 😆  Hugs from Denmark! 🇩🇰
Mammamia , Amazing 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
#couplesgoals <3
u make it all look so easy and its tough as hell..amazing work..u r living my dream too :)
Watching this episode again, just because I love the 5 of you. So this needs to be said, your kickass DomeHome looks like you live on the Forrest moon of Endor. How have you not had Ewoks over for dinner yet? 😂 😘
Love Lilly 🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛❤️❤️❤️
you are so cute, talented and beautiful, WOOOW! I'm so glad that I've found you. I hope that one day I will have a relationship like the 2 of you ❤️
Love your cozy, well appointed kitchen ! Way to go guys,you’re inspiring me! My guy and I are finally at the place where we are going to sell our homes and build/ buy something smaller together and as he’s retired and I’m close in the next few years to being retired, we want to travel in our well appointed and small T@B 400 trailer during winter months in warmer climate!  Can’t wait to see your continued coverage!  Cheers from British Columbia! 🥂
You are both just amazing.what you both have done in such a short time is fantastic .
Love how the dogs look at the camera during the intro.
Where's your stove and bathroom? I don't think I could live without either. Love you guys!!!!
interessante e divertente. Sono curioso... dove dormite ragazzi nella cupola?
What an enticing project. ( Hope IKEA sponsor you soon! Xx)
I love your the title picture beautiful view and beautiful family.  Just looking outside made me cold.
“Where are the hot firefighters when you need them?”  You guys are just naturally so funny.
Yeah, kittens are a "little busy" but oh so cute!  Don't expect her to grow out of that any time soon.  Your home is absolutely stunning.  Could you please tell me where you found that island with the stools?  Thanks.
You guys are adorable 🥰
I’m pretty new and was wondering are you guys vegan/vegetarian?
What a wonderful job you have made of your kitchen love it, Lily like her new bath/kitchen sink, I also love the way you worked yourselves out of the Ikea cabinet debacle.
Where is the stove???
do you ever worry about bears ripping thru your dome home?
not me crying over how that countertop looked after you added the sink lol
Minute 4:25 : I was watching this while cooking and I wasn’t looking at the screen. I hit rewind to watch your faces while Tyler was saying that. The innuendo has no limits 😂😂😂
I'd looks So AMAZEBALLS!!! I am loving it you guys!! Great job!!! I heard the Hallo music when you put the sink in. Beautiful!!
Love your adventure and think you guys are absolutely wonderful! Rob/NYC
That’s your dream kitchen?
Still love that clip 😊👍🌷
Hey guys, love the kitchen!!   It's gorgeous.  Did you think about a backslash to keep things from falling behind the cabinets?
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇬🇧xx
Where is your food cubby with drawers from?!
Wow!
You have my favorite farm sink design. I love it. I’m so happy for both of you and envious at the same time, because I don’t have so lovely things as you. I’m still obsessed by the tiles you used before. (Behind a heater or an oven in the RV.) Great that you enjoyed your date. Please have more dates. I enjoyed your video again. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥰🥰🫖🫖🥞🥞🧇🧇☕️☕️ I’m so excited for you both to have such an open and amazing kitchen. It’s beautiful. Thank you very much for sharing your project.
Gym + Coffee I first heard about from Niall Horan and love their clothes. Crazy to see it now sponsoring on YouTube. Definitely doing another order.
Is there any way you guys can post two videos each week? We feel there is so much we are missing out on and NEED to evolved more!!!!!
Son unos chulitos, me encantan!  Hay Lily 🤣
You should totally get like a lil chandelier to hand in the middle of the dome
More musings on Idiot-proof 😄Cabinets.  I always retort, "But, I'm a GENIUS'. The next joke is 'but you can never find an idiot to put it together for you'.  Of course it could mean it's a guaranteed proof of one's inherent level of intelligence.  Wyle E. Coyote SUPER-GENIUS. 😉
4:29 lol
You guys are amazing, I am in the process of planning my new house, starting to build in June, in the Caribbean.  I am looking to incorporate a geodesic dome as well. I am not sure if this question came up before, but where did you buy your dome kit? And the interior and exterior covering?
I have just spent my Sunday morning catching up on 10 weeks of Tyler and Todd and their beautiful family adventures   I have had a torrid few weeks and being ignoring my mental health like an ostrich with my head in the sand   Your weekly program I have come to realize is very good for me to remind me to check in with myself regularly and acknowledge when life gets too much   Thank you for bringing us into your home and lives weekly   You are both incredibly special
How about a chain of lights against one of the metal lines of the "window", just to put on during the nights 🤗🤔
Lily is responding to all the love between you too. She looks like she wants to play in the sink. Does she like toys in water 💧? Great video and love the decor.
Thats an inappropriate question but considering the relative small place you now live in, the 2 dogs and the cat, do you actually have time to be intimate ?
Once you start cooking and using sink you will have splatter. Have you planned some kind of backsplash so the interior cloth doesn't become that?
Hi Tyler and Todd, do you have a link for that kitchen table with the two stools? I’ve been trying to find something like that for my apartment. Thanks!
This popped up on my computer. So I'm going to watch it again. See y'all tomorrow. I'm excited
Happy to see Eddie and Charlie. White kitchen…so clean looking. Pretty fridge. Love shaker cabinets. I LOVE the kitchen. We have no IKEA here. I know. Unbelievable.
Just amazing how far you’ve come!  It looks incredible!
Are you guys OK in this storm?
Hi guys Heard the news release from NS Power on rate increase and fee they was from people who are "off grid" One example was on if you generate $3000. Yoi would have to give NSP about $1000. What a green mindset! I suspect it's a thought balloon so they get the 10% over 3 years they want
More snow..but suppose to be plus 7 next week
I am very impressed by what you guys achieved with your own hands. It must have been very challenging for you. It's great to see you livng this dream and making this dream actually work. Good luck!
Fabulous! “So good!” Inspiring!
Fri. 1/28. You guys have a HUGE snowstorm 🌨headed your way this weekend.  Stay safe, stock up, stay warm. 🔥      💕💕☃️💕💕
My fav vid, " red tote bath" ROTFL.  You made my night.
Tip for attaching to the floor... create slots in your laminate/flooring so the screws going into the floor can slide back and forth as the floors shrink and expand with the seasons. I forgot and summer came and all my floors buckled. Then winter came and the floors settled back but then pulled apart. Now I have open seams throughout my living room, dining room, and kitchen. Only way to fix at this point is tear it all out and re-lay the floor and then put the cabinets back with the slots. :(
Weather Alert!!!  Snow and Maximum wind gusts: 80 to 100 km/h..., Dome Test again!!!  01/28/2022
a very very warm home has remained, like you.

I just came across your channel. You guys are so friggen amazing with your skills. Also, both of you are great eye candy 😉
Hey guys  I have a quick question  AG supplements  How long have you been using What do you think it has improved  I'm really thinking about changing things up  I really appreciate your input  Cheers
Did y'all pay for the land thou
Aren't you sacred of grizzly bears ? :0
Excellent job on kitchen guys!! 👏🤗🇦🇺
I absolutely loved it. Gorgeous setting. Good job guys! ❤️
Hey, have y'all seen the geoship geodesic homes? Sounds like they're made out of ceramic 😊
Instead of building a box to obstruct the view ... you could make something like this perhaps ... still would get that ''loft'' bed without obstructing the view ... also stepping into a tighter space makes entering the open area in front of the large window even more impressive, perhaps? Love your work ... no matter what you do I am sure you will kill it  ^^  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ufuk77F7M
Amazing, simply amazing… you two are unbelievably brave.  #unstoppable. Btw the boys & cat having breakkie side by side is adorable… those three hit the jackpot, fell in a nice family
I wish y’all videos were longer! Lol
Im a new subscriber and found your channel because I watch Peter Monn’s channels, and he’s recommended y’all’s channel a few times so...... Here I am and I’m binge watching! I absolutely love y’alls channel! I’m from South Carolina and we don’t have a Ikea! I’ve never been in one! I have ordered off their website.. I was going to hire someone to install some shelves & drawers In my closet, but after watching yalls videos I believe I can do it myself, and I Thank you for giving me the confidence to do my homework and try this diy myself! 🤞🏻
So happy for you! Great job, guys; love ya'!
I love love looooove the new refrigerator and the sink. I love the kitchen look set up. Great job 👏
You guys are so talented.  I can’t comprehend how hard that place would be to put together and you figure it all out every time.  I love your entire cute family.
I find myself grinning during the entire video. I wish you a continued happy long life together. You two truly were meant for each other and obviously bring out the best in yourselves and the other. Your positive approach to projects and life is contagious!!
🤎🤎🤎
New subscriber here.  @pettermonn recommend your channel on his last YT video. Glad to find you. Fun content.  Now I will binge watch.
The 2 T's." It's been Unseasonably warm. 3° no wonder you're sweating ..lol
You guys are plowing through these projects!! Enjoying coming along for the journey. My wife and I are going tiny and are in the design process
still using that outdoor shower?
This video was "so good".
love the kitchen!!! it looks so cozy.. also lily is such an adventurer. adorable!
👏🏻👍🏼❤️❤️
Oh no, the only thing I don't share is my clothes! 😳 Love the kitchen. The whole dome for that matter. 😃
I adore your sexual innuendos. I also love the way you look at one another with so much love. Thanks for the great videos!
Wondering what you're doing today in this -20 degrees? Shared bodily warmth with dogs as blankets?
I’m so excited with you for your kitchen 💙💜❤️
I swear I keep coming back for the music
Wonderful
Seems the dome was not affected by the winds of the "noreaster remnants that passed by which is great! "Convoy for Freedom 2022"
OMG like everything you both do... it's wonderful!
Lily is so beautiful!
I have said it before and I will say it again: You guys incredible! Love your videos. Truly, I don't know how you have time to make them.
Hi guys Luv your work & you both, you bring a smile &/or a chuckle to my lips almost constantly. here's a link ( https://www.youtube.com/c/Ozponds/featured )to a guy who does pond design & builds in Australia on a budget. I think this might help when the Summer hits there. I'm in NZ so probably the opposite of what your going through.
Guys the place looks great. Just one question? Where is the bathroom located? Or do you have an Outhouse?
Todd's look when Tyler said "multiple holes" was everything!!! It was lovely to watch Tyler blush and try to recover! Thank you for sharing that little exchange.
I know in Germany when you sell your unit you take your kitchen with you. That is where the free standing kitchens evolved from in Europe. They have been around forever. However, they are a major investment because you own them for eons. My son is a builder renovator and has installed many IKEA case goods. In his projects. Love you guys❤️
I’m sure Bec & Eamon had the same issue when they built their IKEA kitchen.
Hi, long time viewer, first time commenter…I love what you’re doing and am smitten with the beauty of the natural wilderness. What part of Nova Scotia is that and why did you select that area? I’m reading up on different features and aspects of the geography and trying to get a feel for the cultures town to town. Curious to hear your take! Keep making videos, you’re doing incredible work and having fun doing it, it’s great.
Look at that kitchen!! Ya'll are the bombs!!!
TRY BUBBLE WRAP ON THE WINDOWS! GET THE ICE OFF FIRST, RUB WRAP ON; THEN ADD REFLECTIVE STUFF. Just an idea guys. Hopefully that will work. Anything is possible. Great job.
Hi.  I produce Nick Cannon's talk show .  I've been following for about a year now.  You guys do such a great job producing these videos!!   Also, I'm a LEGIT city boy as I live in a high rise in Manhattan but you make me want to get a geodome in the woods!!  Loving the vids.
I don't understand why rounded cabinetry is not being designed for these Dome and Urt homes!! I  suppose if you had the money for custom made stuff it would go smoothly!!!
Great work guys and Hi from Edmonton, AB! Love the new kitchen.
Hi from Winnipeg!  I love the dome!  Wondering where that awesome island and stool set came from? So cute!
Love the kitchen !! ❤️  And wtf Lilly 🐾 lol no getting high in the trees 🌲!  What is the second dressing ? I’d drizzle the both of you 😛 ❤️❤️❤️
I've been following the Oak Island series for several years and am just curious if you're near the island.
Luv these guys.  Are there bears and how do you stay safe from them in the dome?
Oh I just love you guys!  Congratulations - so happy for you and that new kitchen!
All I can say is wow!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
“Dream kitchen” ? Who dreams about a kitchen? Really cheesy. Am I missing something?  Perhaps you are hoping a few more housewives will subscribe. I want a dream kitchen!  Jeez.
Just watched another video of you two from a year ago. Love how far you've come with your new home and adventure in such an incredibly short time. Still laughing at Todd's naughty comments to poor unsuspecting Tyler. :)
Everything is going along so great for both of you.  I am loving that kitchen.  I am a disabled person in a wheelchair and I could use something like that.  Great idea.
You both Killed it!! Awesome Job!!!
Hi there I'm new here from Darwin Australia. So glad to meet you both and enjoy the cosy results now that a lot of the hard work has been done ✅.
Tyler Todd and Sons- Greetings from Mexico - Love the Vids, you guys work so hard!  I've been cooking for almost 60 yrs & enjoy preparing food for others (with whatever limitations)  Watching what you prepare I haven't seen a lot a Indian Cuisine (great for vegans).  My favorite Hindu Dish is Chole, a popular Street food.  It's FOOL-PROOF, easy and not labour intensive.  Fry Onions Garlic in butter(vegan) Add Cooked chickpeas(cooked with a couple of teabags to add colour), tomatoes, & chole spices (Indian stores sell it already prepared- Cumin, cardamom, black pepper, chili, onion seed, cinnamon, mango ginger, pomegranate powder, garlic powder). Goes great with Todd's garlic naan.  Best wishes Jim
Considering this time of year, your heat must be working really well seeing you in shorts and t-shirts.  I HATE having to put together IKEA.  I would be SOO frustrated if there was a part missing but you guys take it so well.  Tyler, I too had a hobby of videography for a while and created a bunch of transitions and effects which are free on my YouTube site.  Scroll down to about 5 years ago.  Some are over the top but you might find something you could use.  They were made in Motion and are plugins for FCP,  You really put out very professional and interesting video editing.  I am so impressed.  BRAVO!!
You guys are SO amazing. XOXOXO
Love, love, love watching you guys being creative and productive.
Your home is so cute 🤗🌈👬🏼🐶🐈‍⬛🐶👬🏼🌈🤗
Such a lovely, comforting space 🌱  As always y'all are making it happen.  Thank you for taking us along.
You guys are great, but sorry Lily stole this episode!! 😻😻😻
https://youtu.be/kWuWWQG4j6w
Wow Todd and Tyler your new kitchen really looks amazing!! Absolutely love it!! Can't wait for your next video👍👍
Are you planning to build a loft area?
How do you guys shower now?
Looks soooooo good guys!!!! <3
What you guys have accomplished is amazing! Lots of Love and Kindness.
I never get tired of that bath in the tote clip!You have outdone yourselves, AGAIN!! Simply stunning!
Steal cap slippers…? 😂😅
Eww Lily uses her liter box and walks on your eating surfaces. Sorry but that’s gross. A cat should not be on your counters/tables. Love y’all though. Looks much more than fabulous!!!
🤣🤣🤣 I have found in my some 40 years of ikea experience that it’s idiotproof…but whenever men have been involved something goes wrong…just sayin’ 😁
Just amazing you guys are amazing. Can I come visit for a home stay please ? :)
You guys seem happier designing your homestead than when you were traveling! And, I'm loving the homesteading vlogs, could watch you for years doing this!
Hey, gentlemen. My husband and I have been together 25 years. We own 10 rural acres. I would love for us to "retire" early and move there but my hub is a city mouse. How did you arrive at having the same dream together, being such "newlyweds"?
Do you guys have a stove/oven ?
Wow! It’s looking beautiful!
Looks so awesome
You guys!! The place looks SO beautiful 😍  let me put one on your land and be bestie neighbors haha.
U guys are soooo good. Lol
Great Kitchen...but, where do you cook?
Boys, love the kitchen. Where did you get that amazing breakfast bar and stools?....must have
I stumbled across your vlog via vanwives, I subscribed for more of Lily! Also Nova Scotia. Oh, and your content.
Sorry but IKEA products 👎👎
What a beautiful ingenious design. Hope you have 4 seasons of happy memories in 2022.
y'all should use the scraps from the counter top to add a small 1in. lip op the back of your counters so things don't roll off the back and get caught between the wall and the counters.
Oh my, Lilly and the tree. Been there done that lol. Had to chuckle.  Love your kitchen.
Looks amazing guys! 👍
Absolutely love how it's all coming together! So beautiful!! Who needs a house? But right now, all I see is a pile of Lily's mousies under the kitchen cabinets. 🤣
guys this looks amazing . just be mindful that washing any metal objects will leave black marks on the porcelain that wont always come off . oooooooo it's so exciting seeing it all come together :-) Love it!
Wonderful Men!!  Congratulations!
Your home is coming along great!  One of the best thing is the view! I love the balance between your animals and between ya'll! Saw your channel a couple of weeks ago and now I'm hooked! You guys are so sweet and the energy that you each bring to the table is awesome!  Keep them coming and I'll keep watching.. and thank you for bringing us along for the ride and sharing your lives with us! God bless and stay safe!
When I was little, my cat ended up at the top of a telephone pole. While insisting that my Daddy rescue him, he insisted it could get down on it's own. He was right!
I usually watch you guys on my smart TV (if there's a way to leave a comment I haven't figured it out yet) I always make sure to hit that Like button (I follow instructions well..LOL). I always enjoy your vids and look forward to each Sunday afternoon so I can see your progres. Love the dome, my cousin used to build them back in the 90s - they were wood not canvas like yours. Hope it works out to be everything and more you that you want. Will see you Sunday!!  Tony
I just LOVE the Island & stools!!!😍🥰 Would you mind sharing where you got them???
So GORGEOUS!!!
You guys are so much fun to watch:))) Fun!
I just love you guys! I see you and all I want for my son is the same loving relationship you have! Thank you! <3
Kitchen is looking great
What are you doing with regards to a cooking stove/oven for the dome?  It's coming together bit by bit.😀😀😀😀
We looove a multiple hole 🕳 cabinet
So good
Love you guys ♥️♥️ you are so inspirational xxxx
After all this time out in the woods it feels kind of strange watching you guys building stuff indoors haha.
wow love the kitchen you guys are really moving along
So cool love it you guys
so nice of you to build a kitchen just for Lilly...lol
I stumbled across you guys yesterday, and I'm seriously loving it all! I do have a question though. Why didn't you put the island on wheels?
When you were cutting it I was like "That's a cutting board! This is the perfect cutting board!" Then you said it too.  I am so happy for you! Enjoy your new kitchen!
Multiple holes boys really 😂😉💕
Are you having running water in that place or not
Very nice.
It’s so nice watching you guys, I wish I didn’t have to stop! I do understand with your busy life more than one video a week is not possible but sometime in the future I hope it will be!
You guys are so creative and talented!!  💜
Great awesome job guys.. way to persevere!!!
Naughty Todd, I count 6 metaphoric eye-rolls from Tyler!!!
I can’t wait for Sundays. Love you guys, blessings!
Wuauuuuu, so beautiful, as every proyects you do. Enjoy it.
You guys did great! This looks really good!
6'2? You guys are super tall 🥺
aww Lily! my cat also did this to me on a MUCH taller pine tree ._. I spent more than 4 hours and there was no ladder on earth that could reach her. Eventually and somehow she managed to go down the tree enough for me to catch her, I was so scared!! I'm glad Lily is fine <3
Love ❤️ the kitchen!! You guys are so talented.
Lol. Cute cat rescuers. By the way, cats can _usually_ make their own way down given time :) they also tend to land on their feet, unlike humans 🤕 (appreciate its less safe for kitty in the middle of the Canadian wilderness than in my back garden!)
OMG Lilly is such a character! Love her so much. Thanks for keeping her safe and getting her out of that tree (and into the sink! haha)
Absolutely great and beautiful!
I'm new to your channel and love you guys. I've been trying to find the video that explains how you found the land and what made you decide to develop it. I'm also wondering what happened to your first RV. I saw something about being vandalized, but no explanation how that occurred or where you were when that happened. And why did Charlie need surgery? Why I love you guys...you normalize same sex relationships. Something the whole world is in dire need of and has been for ages.
How blessed I feel to have found your channel!  What an amazing paradise you both have built from the ground up.  Truly inspirational.
I’m jealous of YOUR VEGAN RESTAURANT!! I’ve been vegan for 8 years and live in a small town in central Florida     AND,,very limited choices to eat out….Usually eat at home and if I do go out,,,,baked potatoes with veggie….SO I DONT GO OUT MUCH …That food looked VERY GOOD…
Love guys....❤❤🌈😀😯😌
You guys are so awesome! Love watching your blog!! Very positive and inspiring! You most not of watched Eamon in Bec’s IKEA kitchen episode. Same drawer problem.
Where's that f"ing" woodpecker, hahaha
I have been watching you guys from the beginning and I love what you've achieved!   But I do have a question.  Did you finish the sauna?
Question: It's winter outside. And you both are in a "tent". And you dress like if it's midsummer. How warm is it inside? 30°C Or, because you are canadian, 15°C inside is more than enough? ⛄
IKEA should give you a huge discount for. Free ads  👍❤️❤️❤️you guys . Awesome works so far !
Uh... bathroom? Or are you roughing it outdoors? ;)
Looking amazing!
When I come to visit, where are you going to put me? Out in the cold?
Love the whole set up, what about the cooker though .
Do you claim a piece of forest ? Or do you purchase it?
I’m so hooked! You guys are amazing 😻
I recently discovered your channel. What initially caught my interest was your Dome home which I'm enjoying watching you finish. I'm impressed with how hard you both have worked to achieve your dream of off-grid living. And I must say I think you two are just adorable together. 🙂
Once again guys you never cease to amaze me! What an accomplishment. So happy 😀 that things are all falling into place for ya.
Hey guys. The dome looks great. I have some friends that have a dome and they say mice love the material. Look up bucket and pop can trap. It's great to place under the platform. I am exited to build our own. Good luck with all.
Looks fantastic gentlemen!
love your frig...so pretty and I am so happy for you guys I know last year you all looked like you couldn't even move in the rv.  hey the ice on the inside of your dome may mean that there is still a lot of moisture in the air, the wood stove helps to dry out the air, a small fan blowing warm heat across the doom could help distribute the warm air around and help to dry out the excess moisture.   may be worth a try....
Well done ģuys. Looking like home. Love from New Zealand x
you guys made that look easy. Congrats all around.
So good.
ok boys, if it were me living in that lovely place, I would look up and use the skylight as a diagram to make zones out of the floor plan, that light looked like it had 5 sections, taking blue tape I would make pie shapes on the floor, these sections would be my "corners" to work from....like I would place the kitchen in one slice, but now what do I want directly across from the kitchen, and what do I want on either side of the kitchen slice, then step back to the front door and see how balanced it feels, each slice can be  divided up into smaller pieces, like the slice by the door, would have a small area as a mud room, for coats and boots, so,...  I don't know it this made any sense what so ever, but thinking in slices of a circle would be how I would group items that make up individual rooms.... may help wrap you head around the slices as "rooms" instead of corners....
Kitchen is lovely! I love Lily, new follower, is it going to have a bathroom? Or is the bathroom outside? I’ve seen the epic outdoor shower!
Love it!
:)
Beautiful kitchen. I am getting ideas
I noticed you were on the trending page and I was so proud of you!!!  Whoop whoop! 🥳💖 The dome is coming together so beautifully.  Well done lads.  PS I love Lily.
How dare you! Just leaving me in suspense here and a whole freaking week till the next video. 😒 Can't wait till it's all finished. It looks amazing
Will you have a stove? oVEN?
It was so good... LOL
Loved the video!!! And your cat!!! Your animals are so blessed! May I ask where you purchased the bar and barstools? Love everything that you are doing!
So happy I found your channel, you two are awesome to watch!! If I may impose a quick question, where did you guys get that island? Love that you can hook the chairs up for storage, very clever find! Thanks and best wishes on the next project you two tackle!
Todd- Finally gonna have more than 2 salad dressing options! Tyler- we're moving up in the world  🤣😂🤣😂
Looks awesome💖 well done👏🏼
Looks fantastic!!
yesss that is so beautifully setup!
I look forward to the weekly updates and seeing you teamwork and accomplishments.  I love the fur babies and compliment you on the cat tree rescue.
I love the look of the dome's inside; WOW! You guys are amazing: love everything about it: you must be so proud of yourself. What a great way to start 2022!
You guys are so cute!! Good job on the kitchen! Keep well fellas. 👍😁
Damn! How damn nice
Kitchen looks fantastic! Where did you get the cabinet on the other side of the fridge? The one with the drawers in the middle of shelves?
It's really starting to look more like a home.  Good job you two!  I'm actually super excited about the solar build and can't wait to see how it comes out.
Oh my God Todd and those holes lol
Love the new kitchen. Congrats!  And Lilly is so cute!
Wow!  Like a refrigerator light, but in the cabinet!  Ingenious!  I've got to build my new computer desk, but I'm planning cabinets below, and lights in there would be great!  Thanks, guys!  EDIT:  Lilly is so, so cute, playing in the sink!  My kitty used to jump into, and play in the empty washing machine!
At least you guys know who the real star is - Lily!! Glad her dads could rescue her.
Congratulations this is exciting 👏 Bravo the kitchen looks fabulous and Lilly is the cherry on top being in the sink lol so happy for you guys
Wow views are crazy high congratulations
This kitchen looks amazing. Wow. Just love it💕
You guys should totally contact IKEA. They should pay you for the advertising💕
Is your refrigerator for camping? Does it run on DC? It would be great to know more details about it; it looks really cool. Pardon the pun!
Missed Todd jokes 😂😂😂💓 lmaooo he’s genuinely funny without even trying. Wish y’all posted more ☹️ love you guys tho, and everything is looking good 😍🔥 !!! #🇺🇸
Impressive work. Design is great!!
I love your kitchen, it's so nice and awesome! :) So calming and peaceful, especially with Lily chasing her tail in the sink. It's always funny watching my cat, Skittles chasing her tail. I can't wait to see what's next. Stay well everyone!
I wish I was more like Todd, he is so wonderfully organized, truly it is a thing of beauty. I love your videos, I am like a broken record but I have to keep saying it. That little bit about mischievous little Lilly in the tree, that was so cute you guys rescuing her.
Omg! It looks SO GOOOD!!!
New York Is Where I'd Rather Stay I Get Allergic Smelling Hay I Just Adore A Penthouse View "Thomas and PJ"  I LOVE You But Give Me Park Avenue  I know I'm aging myself with these lyrics but if you ever want to explore the "Best Life Ever" you must experience living in the City of New York.  It's like no other place in the world.  You and all your family and friends are always welcome to come and stay for a visit ANYTIME.  It's on MY BUCKET LIST to give Thomas and PJ the grand tour.  Sending you good wishes always.  Jonathan The door is always open and I have plenty of room in my spacious two bedroom apartment.
I read that bubble wrap on the windows absorbs the cold and wet from snow. Since you are ordering items that might be delivered wrapped in bubble wrap, thought you could experiment and see if this story is true. Condensation in windows isn’t much fun to clean up. Good Luck. Happy for you you now have a place to call home.
Yeyyyy!!! So beautiful 🤩  Gorgeous kitchen .. And honestly I can’t stop laughing on  “ I feel so cheap” 🤣🤣 Hilarious
My favorite thing is the jump cut to Todd saying "I feel cheap" and then a flash forward to your really nice kitchen 😂
Wow great job guys!  It looks super fab x
Recommend training your young cat 🐈 on a harness & leash. Easier for tree 🌲 top rescue!
WOW guys your incredible your both so determined  to accomplish something and you really get it done. GBU BOTH. Que Viva el AMOR....
What is the name of the song that is played before your videos?  You two are awesome.  Love IKEA
Wow! Love everything! That refrigerator 😍 place is gorgeous!    🤣I feel cheap 🤣🤣🤣
Besides being adorable and funny and entertaining and talented and all the rest...both of you really look very sexy when you're using tools, especially power tools. Really, geez, you're so appealing!!! Love Love
Seeing the 'kids' all eat together is not only adorable but rather amazing!  Just goes to show the incredible peaceful vibe you guys have in your new home :)
Solar!!! So happy you're getting that in. The kitchen looks soo good. You guys are so rocking it.  It's so nice that you guys got a date night in. It's much deserved and necessary to keep you focused on what's important. Much, much luv from Texas.❤
mmm well I like what I see. But I see there is a very important part of your cooking fresh meals system MIA!  Where IS the stove? I waited for mention of where it would be located................but, still waiting! 😳 how can you have yummy food without a cooktop/oven setup?  😁
And your home is incredible 😍😍
so nice!!! so good!!
Was it the Ikea restaurant 😱😱😱 it look amazing… nothing to compare at the one we have here in Boston (and the one i went in Quebec and Belgium and France when i lived there 🤨) you are lucky 😋 Heuuu where do you live? 🤪
Absolutely fantastic guys, you guys are incredible, greetings from the emerald isle💚💚💚🍀🍀🍀
Looks amazing, I love the storage sink for Lilly. You’re going to need a board across the back of the counter or you’ll eventually drop things down the back ❤️
So good!  Cats will get themselves out of trees. If you  had continued walking she probably would have run past you in a minute or two.
Love the kitchen, it looks sooo good. Enjoy all your hard work! Blessings💜
I had to rewind right after Lil Lilly jumped to you...she was so quick like..."ohhh my hot firefighter daddy came to save me.  Maybe I've learned my lesson... maybe not.. Um  cuz' IM LILLY N IM GONNA LIVE LIFE!'   LOVE YOUR BABIES
Beautifulllllllll
Oh my goodness I get so excited when I see your video . It's like if my imaginary kids came home for the weekend from College.
I love it!
the synchronized chelsea boot steps as you were walking into ikea. I screamed. My queens. Thank you for sharing the silly joyful moments of gay love. It means so much to me. Sending tons of love
You two! You’ve come a long way babies!! The dome is especially awesome. I’d live there for sure! Such a unique atmosphere. Honestly?… I watch you guys just because of the way you look at each other. It’s the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen. Never change. Ever!! 🌳 👨🏻‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏼 ❤️💪🏼🌲🪵💫
I absolutely love your fridge!! And Lily is adorable! I had a black cat for 18 yrs, they are the best! So (there's that word😂) happy for ya'll.. beautiful home.
It would be sooo cool to see you guys create yalls own sustainable home company!
Mmmmmm idea Food looks soooo mmmmmmm.
Your new kitchen is beautiful. Thanks for sharing 👍 🥰
Did I miss them addressing the bathroom situation in a previous video?
Love it! You have thought of every detail. Where did you get your bar and stools? Is that Ikea? Thanks!
The kitchen is adorable.  So much room for canning next fall!  You guys are so adorable and so patient with each other! Love your videos every week!!
You're both adorable, I love that you love each other with a twinkle in the eye, never loose that. KITCHEN looks great, would be better if you teach Lilli no sitting in the sink or table , just take her off each time, remember those feet walk thru wee and poo lol
So good!
Our cats have all LOVED our sinks. Hilarious
Just love you guys. You've literally kept me sane during the pandemic and I really mean that. Thanks so much.
Ive been very down lately and your guys a energy is just what I needed , thank you for sharing glimpse of your life ,cant wait for a finish tour ,XO!
The kitchen looks great just like everything else. Great job y’all ♥️
So cool 😎
Mr Timberlina and I are dying to know WHERE IS YOUR BATHROOM? ❤️💋
Guys....you forgot the TOEKICK
💚💚💚 all kudos to you Guys.  I am in absolute awe💗Your love and fun   resonates off the screen and ibeyond...thank You🥰Bath Uk💗
Love every video yall put out ❤❤
Beautiful kitchen! I love it!
Omg I’m sooo happy for you boys. Can’t wait to see the new video
With the garden and vegan. U should think about green house and a Root Cellar for bounty of garden a safe place for storm and. Forest fire if trapped.
That was neat!  Your kitchen looks wonderful.  I can’t wait to see the solar panel installation.  I never want your video to stop!  Looking forward to next Sunday.
I am so jealous!!!!!!!!! Beautiful kitchen! You need to keep the cat nip away from the cat!
What was that ending? I was so excited to see the solar system setup. I don't want to wait 😫
Cartwheel competition! You guys are too cute!
I have to have this island! You had me when you showed the stools sliding into and off the floor! Do you have the exact name of the island or do I just type island on IKEA search box?
Training a cat... that's really funny!  At least that's the case with my cat - she does not appreciate my attempts to train - ever, I've found making things uncomfortable is easier (not in a mean way - I love my cat).  Maybe one of those stainless grid inserts??!  Good luck on that part.  Things are coming together - it looks beautiful and I cannot imagine how difficult it is having a round space to "build" or decorate anything into.  You're doing a great job!  👏🏻👏🏻
I did mot know there was an IKEA store in NS?
For sure on the cutting board! Wow!
So funny.  I was thinking this week “I wonder when they’ll have their kitchen installed?”  How silly of me!  Of course you did it yourselves!  It looks so awesome!  I just love your vintage styled fridge too.  Great job.  💗
BEST CLIP EVER! "UMM I FEEL CHEAP" 🤣🤗🤣
And to save the day! 2x4 😂
Bless your hearts! You went all the way into town to get the other legs & you know! Well, at least you had a date night!
Wish you would come here and help me organize my kitchen.
Love you guys so much! I am a Taurus and will voice my opinion! BUY ANOTHER SHIRT! xoxo
Pulling in! Or Pulling out! No pun intended in reference to holes!
The orange and Black beard threw me!❣️
Oh my gosh! I wanted to get one of thoughs retro fridges!
You’re new kitchen kitchen looks absolutely fabulous!! I wonder how you are going to be able to teach Miss L that a sink isn’t a kitty bed. 🤣
A variety of holes! 😂 (_0_) excuse me! multiple holes! (_00_)
True test of a marriage……building ANYTHING IKEA together, and NOT killing each other🤣❤️🤣❤️
Amazing job
Lilly is gangsta....in the sink
You guys have done an amazing job. I love your dome.
you guys are the Backstreet Boys of sexiness
the doggies are totally unimpressed. hilariously so:))). they be like - "dads, keep working"
The kitchen is beautiful! The fur babies are adorbs! Looks ng forward to this new project. Hmmm. I wonder what it could be 🤔
These videos are my “comfort food” :) mmmm. Thanks guys
Loved his face when you said "multiple holes" ... you guys are so fun.  We're always proud of you, even if you forget your legs. LOL   You're making great progress. Keep it "up".  Warm Hugz~
Where did you get your table?!
Love the kitchen!  Everything looks great!  Woo hoo!  Solar panels!  Lily in the sink is ridiculously cute!
Are you guys going to put in a stove since you put in your sink?
I just absolutely love you guys! I get such a tickle with your sense of humor!! I love how one of you can say something totally innocent, yet the other starts smiling and laughing cause they have turned your innocent comments into something much deeper!!! I totally get you both!  Your new kitchen looks awesome and putting together IKEA furniture can be totally frustrating lol!!
Oh and it looks lovely, love you ❤️
Hi! Where do you cook?
Even though I love you boys I’m feeling some pangs of envy - I have NEVER been able to follow IKEA instructions from start to finish.  Your kitchen is perfect!
The progress is so exciting!  As always, thanks for sharing.  I look forward to seeing you and your Sunday updates.  :)
When you said, “Ikea kitchens are pretty much idiot proof,” I was immediately like hmm🤔 because I watched Eamon and Bec install their Ikea kitchen a few months ago, and they had the exact same problem that you guys did!
We’re were both of you when I built my shop? I definitely would of loved to have you both here with me to help lol! You both are so incredibly talented and so funny. Love watching you both and your beautiful fur babies💕
What was the internal air temperature? You guys wearing short sleeves and shorts
I am so happy I found you !!!!  You two just make my smile .
Sweet and sour cauliflower is AWESOME! But.... you need to use potato starch rather than cornstarch. It doesn't burn in the oil or make a mess of the oil, either. Totally worth it. If you want to fry ANYthing - use potato starch (including tofu) and get that aquafaba going on - don't throw away the chickpea juice. Makes great mayo!
Looks really great!
Your kitchen build brought back such memories of putting together those same cabinets while I was approximately a gazillion months pregnant LOL We have those, and the same countertop and the double sink version of your sink! I hope cooking in your kitchen brings you as much joy as cooking in ours brings me!❤
The kitchen looks amazing.  Do you have a bathroom on the dome?
That looks lovely well done boys
Cartwheel competition 🤣🤣🤣
Fantastic looking kitchen and great job with the staging. As a realtor, I know that the staging can really make a difference in how a place looks. It can add to or detract from its appeal. You have definitely added to it. I look forward to your videos every week. Until next week, I hope all goes well with this week's projects.
It looks so awesome! But what did I miss... Do you have a bathroom inside the dome? How will you wash the dishes if you have no running water? I understand you said you'd wash them in a dishpan but where are you getting the water from, where do you go to the bathroom and shower in the freezing cold winter? I'm just curious. It does look awesome though
I cant picture where the oven/cooktop will go but wow the place looks so awesome. Its been a fun ride to follow this and a great distraction from these crazy times, thank you!
Oohhhh my God!! The tease at the end! PS: Love the Rubbermaid tote scene! I've watched that episode at least 3 times! 😂😂😂
OMG 😆 YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE ☺️🥰, Thanks for today’s  addition 🙏🏽☮️🤩
Where did you get the island and stools? Looks great!
Where's the toilet? Outside???
I got the same butcherblock ca 6 months ago. Gorgeous!
Great video! Love seeing things come together for you guys.  So my question is will you guys have room for a bathroom?  And what do you do now, run to the RV?  LOL
Lilly is really loving investigating everything.
Great video!  I was in that same restaurant you both ate at just a few days ago and also had the sweet and sour tofu.  It's an amazing restaurant.  If you are looking for a vegan deli, Real Fake Meats in Halifax is amazing.
I so love what you have done so far abd can't wait to see more.   I'm excited to see the solar panels/ fields project.  Stay safe and sending lots of 💙🙏
Wow!  I’m always impressed, but this is a milestone! Looks so damn good.  Love Charlie & Eddy, they’re so chill & accepting of Lilly.  Carl & I bought a 109 yr old Craftsman Bungalow: 1900 sq ft, complete remodel, we rescued a baby kitten under the front porch, “Maddie”, we’ve always had Labs & Goldens, but she’s now 6 months old and we love her & she rules the household.
Where did you guys get the island!
You two make me smile!🥰
Wow ! Your living space is looking fabulous. Congrats !
I kind of repeat you... Your videos are "so good"  I'm serious.    Continue your journey. Congratulations 💝
Oh my goodness you have done a great job boys. It's sooo good! Lily has a spa what's not to love. Hilarious you have pizza after all that 🤣 Well done It's gorgeous 😍
Not to be a buzz kill, but, where's the toilet, sink and shower?
it looks so great guys!
RE: The bathing in the rubber made.....My husband and I roared when this was aired in real time.  Honestly Chaps, you broke the inter web with the "I feel cheap" comment.  It was particularly funny to us as we endured a similar circumstance way back when.  Oh and Miss Lily pulling focus is always great bonus material! Keep doing you Gents. xx
Where did you get the island, omg that's brilliant!?
Love the kitchen! How are you mitigating condensation/mold in the dome?
todd cracks me up with his reasonings to complete a task, i die bc that is literally me to do anything and he's building f***ing off grid
It already looks so beautiful in the dome! Cant wait to see what the rest of the space is going to look like :) I was wondering if you are going to create a bathroom in the dome? Have a great week, see you sunday! ❤️❤️
Love your home!  It’s so beautiful 😍
You guys are amazing! I could never do this. I moved from NYC to 1 hour away from the city to a house. I have never lived in a house or owned one. We have been here for 7 years and I still have not gotten used to it. I am a city person born and raised in Manhattan. I had to learn how to drive too. So, we have been working on our house for the past 7 years and it's been very hard.   I get to go to Manhattan every couple of months schedule permitting. I miss my city, but this is my new reality for now. I may get a Manhattan apartment to stay in the city when I want to or go back completely since I have not gotten used to this.   But I have to say, feeding the deer, all the beautiful animals that visit me every day is wonderful!!! I feel like snow white with birds sitting on my shoulders...lol. The deer even walk up to me.   I am one hour away from Manhattan, but for people who want to make this transition, it is not what you think. It is very difficult and expensive to own and upkeep a house. Very expensive!!!! And it's a lot of work physically!!! You have no idea. It all sounds dreamy and fun until you have to cut trees, plow snow, maintain an acre of land, drive a tractor lawn machine. As I said, it all sounds fun until you have to dig ditches and cut a tree!!!
I love you guys! ❤️
Love,love,love it!💙
….turns out it has ‘multiple holes’ you can put it in….”… OMG!  So funny watching Tyler realizing what he said when Todd gave him the grin and eye… 🤣😂🤣
Been following the build for awhile. Its been very interesting to see it come to life. I've been very curious about how the plumbing would work, so seeing the kitchen sink installed has helped see the vision. Thanks! :)
Great job once again!
You guys are so cute together,luv watching you guys
Great job!!! Looks fantastic and cozy. I always look forward to seeing you guys and what you've been up to. Stay warm and safe ❤️
yes, countertops are the fun part, but also TERRIFYING. cutting into beautiful butcher block is so scary but as always, you two did a phenomenal job. Everything you do is so GOOD!
A suggestion for spice drawer:  I had my husband drill holes part way through a flat (about 1/4 inch) piece of wood the size of my jars.  Than I used a label maker to label the jars and the holes A1, A1, A2, A2.  Each row was ABCD and going back was 1 2 3 4.  It keeps my spices in alpha order no matter who is putting them away..  I love it.  I hope this makes sense.
Omg I wanna live like y’all too xD
Guys, since you screwed up the kitchen to the floor, I am not sure how you'll access the place in order to put the plumbing... but the final result is really joy for the eye!
So after you guys build your house are y’all going to be using the dome for Airbub?
I have said it before, and Will say it again...I love  you guys, so inspiring, so real, so relatable.  From a fellow Nova Scotian.
Grntlemen, did it hear it correctly? There are multiple holes it can go in   Sir,  after some months I am laughing out loud and wholeheartedly.  Sir, you said it innocently but the undercurrent struck you immediately.  I have stopped,  had a good good laugh.  Posting the comment.  Will watch the rest now.  Thank you.
It looks perfectly splendid! Will you be installing a stove top or will that be for the cabin? Also: you'll probably be making soups and sauces (yummy) -> Be careful not to splash sauces onto the canvas behind the kitchen cabinets. It would be a shame to have tomato and cheese stains on the inside of your dome walls.
This makes me so happy to see- love it
Love the animals, love the kitchen, love you guys!  🌹
Ok I just have to ask......where did you get the storage unit you are using for your pantry???? I am in desperate need of one just like that!!! You two are awesome. I love the way you interact with one another whether you're working or joking around. And I love the dome!! You two are so talented even if you say you are not.....you stick with it and figure things out. Love it!!!!
I love you two guys………you are so good together xxx
is that the Jackery powering the fridge? Wow!
Love the place. Just a thought. You could make the insulation into wall art and that way it would look like pictures you put up.  Which you could change out when you need something fresh or by the season = )
Great kitchen project… and you get a cutting board out of it.
buy some more  shit like that   lol
I am so happy that all your efforts are coming together!  It looks great! You can hear it in your voices! Maybe your cat is signalling that it wants a cathouse or something ( if you don’t already have one) …. A place to it’s own and feel secure???? Not going to comment on the “ multiple holes that it can go in” line 😂 Stay safe, stay sane be well
Love the video! Is this a 24ft dome? What size is it? 💙
New to your vlog! Yes, I am subscribed. Had to say HI! From your neighbor to the south. You guys are just so cute and funny! Love watching. So, I know you haven’t been living in a geodesic home, how would you rate living in one? I have been wanting to go off grid for 3 years now, but watching you guys having fun with it….makes me want it even more. I watch another Canadian channel Myself reliance. He builds his own log houses etc…he has a geodome greenhouse that you might want to check out. Although I don’t live as far north as either of you, we still get some cold weather here in New York. This way you can grow year round. Just a thought. See you all next Sunday.
more Lily content please. I enjoyed this vlog a lot.
Happy for you....enjoy!
I’m thinking plastic on your body isn’t healthy.  Maybe hemp?
This is really a nice and confy place.
Got out of my sick bed to watch your video
Love from Irish fans🇮🇪❤️🇮🇪❤️🇮🇪
So beautiful! I absolutely love the sink and the refrigerator! You both have such great style!
Love the kitchen.  You two are so cheeky sometimes ☺️ . Am sure the cat would have got it self down the little monkey 🤣
I love Todd, (and Tyler) he is so funny and such a hard worker “ cartwheel competition” xxx
Well........job well done as always Tyler and Todd. Every Sunday I get a hot cup of tea a box of tissues and put aside 30 min for myself Tyler and Todd. I have laughed, smiled, cried, talk to the camera and to myself and both of u lmfao. Watching how much u guys love, honor, respect and cherish not only each other but ur fur babies and ur families has helped me be in a far better place with my husband and children. Life isn't perfect far from it but u both take on such positive, refreshing and uplifting positions for each other that it makes me want more for my husband and I this year. We will be married 30 yrs on Jan 29th. The time has both flown and dragged by in equal parts. We have been through the best and worse times of our lives together. 3 living children, (30yrs, 29yrs & 27yrs) 1 stillborn and 4 grandchildren (10yrs, 8yrs, 6yrs & 1yrs) that we would sacrifice all for. Enjoy your week, stay healthy and happy and I will be anxiously awaiting Sunday's video. Much love and gratitude 🙏 ❤  Kris from Canada 🇨🇦 🙏 ☕🥮
I was wondering if you guys are gonna talk at all about how it's been living at the dome so far since it was still quite unfinished when you moved in, like water/light/bathroom etc. Just really curious how you've been making it work and how it compared to living in the RV last winter. Love you guys and so glad to see things move forward! 💜
Looking great guys!  When you said about multiple holes I was just waiting for the giggle lol I just love you guys!
Bravo!  Your place is coming along so Great!  Thanks for the video, my friends <3 <3
OMG, it looks so good! I love the white clean look of it! Lily in the sink is funny! Y'all are the bomb!
Wow it all look soooooooooooo good... love the kitchen and diningroom.... you two have done wonders with everything so far
I have measured things with body parts lol
You two are absolutely spectacular at everything you do💖💖💖
It's looking amazing.
Lilly is such a hoot! And it is soo fricken cute that they all eat together. ❤️❄️❤️
Wow! How did you manage to leave IKEA with so few items?! Haha! That store is like potato chips, one is just not enough.
I love the new kitchen. Are you going to put in a cooktop? Also, come on boys... Lilly would get herself out of a tree. You need not worry. Really, have you ever seen a cat skeleton in a tree... Of course not. If they can climb up, they can climb down. See ya next Sunday!!
The bathing in a tote "I feel cheap" really really needs to be a shirt orrrr tote bag!!!! 😆❤️
Hi guys I watch you fitting your kitchen I was wondering how do cook meals with no cooking appliances xxx
Oh I love you two, but seriously would it be a Tyler & Todd project if you didn’t need to go back to the store 😂 The kitchen looks amazing, love as always ❤️❤️❤️
Hi guys! Just wondering where you had dinner? My hubby and I are vegan and finding good vegan food is difficult here in NS.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣my wife laughed so hard when you said solar system…like planets🤣🤣🤣🤣love your dome…peace and love from Ontario Canada 👊✌️👍😎😷🇨🇦
U guys have great taste. Love, love, love your little kitchenette with the cool island, the ‘Miss Lily’s new spot’ sink and your sleek fridge. Great job, guys! Side note: You might want to consider a backpack-type carrier for cats so u could take all 3 of your furbabies out on walks. Miss Lily would get her mental and sensory stimulation that is most important for her well-being while snug as a bug & safe & warm in one of those.
I like the way the fridge one end & curtain at the both complement each other with the kitchen in the middle🤗 Would not work with a short fridge 😂 Nice job boy's☕🌹☕ Love Sue❤❤❤🇬🇧❤❤❤
maybe add an extra layer of cloth behind the kitchen that you can replace/clean regularly?  would think otherwise your nice clean dome wall will not stay white for long :)
Looking great 😁. You do know that the cat would have done down under its own steam don't you 😂. Xx keep it up, love following you both xx
Must be warm enough in there with the shorts & slippers! Aw your little white legs. LOL
Great job guys! When I first rescued my kitty, Sophi, she would always hang out in my kitchen sink, like Lily 😍 I'm really loving your new space. Bet it feels great to be in it!
Same problem as eamon and Bec. Lol
So homey and beautiful 😍
The kitchen looks so good you guys! The dome home is looking so beautiful! Y’all always do such a great job I knew it would look beautiful when y’all were done. And I love watching Lily she is so adorable and rambunctious.😍😍
Lilly is the star of this show and you better not forget about it 😂😂
I just love watching the creativity of you both and you both together warm my heart! Thank you for all the work you put towards your videos because it does mean a lot :) ♥️💙😇
Ikea should be a sponsor  for a vlog. Ask them.
Having cats myself it made me laugh when you rescued Lilly from the tree, as having being there in the past😆😅🤣 know we have two kitties that are sisters one manic that's up and down trees ect while the others a chubby slob that even struggles to jump on the side boards😅🤣😂, but miss Lilly has lots of trees to climb so good luck there.xxx  great work on  the kitchen by the way👏👏👍👍
Having just returned home from the hospital this was just what the doctor ordered. Lily reminds me of my Ninja Cat, Sparky. She’s going to give you years of humourous moments. Thank you for sharing what would be my dream life.
I love the space you have created. Always look forward to seeing you  each week, to see what wonders you have achieved. Love you both. xx
Congratulations guys. Your dream is visible now. Everything looks amazing
My dad is a firefighter and I go by the station periodically and every time I always look around like, "ok, where are ya'll keeping the hot one?" 😂
Love it
Been there done that ! Good luck !
Kitchen looks fabulous  and how gorgeous is Lily.   My fur daughter still occasionally sleeps in the bathroom sink despite being too big for it and my fur son drinks out of the kitchen tap and also the bath tap until we got rid of the bath in favour of a shower.   So glad things are finally coming together after all your hard work.   You have every right to be proud of everything you've achieved.
Date nites are important guys
excellent.. great crossover plug for Ikea lol.. I really like the dinette set by the window..  friggin cold out Toronto way, 1F last night!!! holy geebers! calling for 4" of snow today..  'I Feel Cheap' hahahahaha, kills me everytime!!! lastly OH Lily Lily.. being a kitten is all..  ❤ see ya's next week.. stay safe & positive..
Last winter you had a freakin stove.  Did you forget something?
Just clock him one you guys make my week lol
Again I ask how you guys are paying for all of this stuff? What is your job or money income?
so much fun to share you adventure, glad you have the courage to do what many of us didn't.
Hello from Indianapolis, Indiana USA 🇺🇲❤️
It looks so good xx
Lily will soon go off the sink when it's full of water!
Do you have cartwheel competitions often?
Loved the opening (Tyler🥰 being sassy) I really enjoyed the whole vibe in this video: All the high energy and tempo throuhgout the video with funny little sidenotes, it just went forward and forward just like you two cute Duracell Bunnies😊 I bet that the full-sized fridge has already proven to be a life changer? Sending lots of good vibes to you both❤️💚
Love the adventure you take us on.  Was that truck?  Have you got it back.  Love the white with timber kitchen. It ties all together with the flooring.  Amazing / great / excellent work Tyler & Todd.  Stay safe and enjoy your new home!
I was thinking… you said that it is hard to place furniture i the space. I suggest you think round instead of square. Do not put the furniture against the wall!
Nice! Do you guys have an oven or stove top?
Wowee!  Your place is looking pretty sweet!  Great job you two!
So love your channel.  You all make me laugh and I love the life you are building 🥰🥰🥰
Amazing you guys! The whole set up is awesome. I started following your channel just before your trip to Hawaii and it's been a lot of fun watching this project come together. Me and my husband are super excited for you and how far its coming along. Kisses to the pooches and Miss Lily!  HUGS.
Looks wonderful.
When it’s Monday morning in Australia it’s Tyler and Todd time 😊o
This kitchen build makes me so happy and your space is really starting to look like home. You must feel so good walking into your kitchen now! Also, what about leaving a bit of water in the sink with the stopper in to discourage Lilly from making the sink her home 🥰
Love your vids. My wish for 2022 is to see you buy proper soft dog beds for the pups.  We don’t realize how difficult it is on older dogs’ joints hard floors are.
I sort of understood the lack of discipline with Miss Puss when life was in the RV, but I'd be having a little chat with her about playing, napping and general rolling around in/on eating and food prep areas.  Ewwwww!
They are literally the two cutest humans in the world. So great they got a date night:)
Guys I'm just wondering about the gap behind the kitchen bench...do you plan to put a cover of some sort to stop spills and things from falling behind it..looks beautiful well done 👏👏👏
Well done Tyler and Todd. The kitchen, the island and dining room look great
You guys have the strongest soul connection I've ever seen + you're both super charming. The fridge is perfect and it has a kinda chic/different style.There's always lots of love in the air, and it makes me laugh and cry.
Enjoy your videos very much on many levels but sharing the “oops” makes it more reliable and doable. Dreams can come true
Yay! The solar panels!   I loved how the kitchen came together but other than the air fryer, what are you going to cook on?  The dome looks so cosy now, who needs a house!  Lily is such a character - does she go out much? Or was that an escape? I’d be so worried I’d never find her with all the trees around you!  She’s such a cutie and the way she eats under the boys is great!  The sink is her new found favourite place!  I never tire of Todd in the tin bath clip ‘I feel cheap’!  It’s so funny!  Why is it that flat packs are never as easy ad they should be - there’s always something missing! However, I’m so glad you had a date night as they are very important in any relationship.....Looking forward to seeing how the solar panels have hopefully gone up next week! Take care. Hugs Judi
U 2 rescued me from a well I've been down for 10yrs!!!  My partner FINALLY bought and built a set a drawers for the bedroom from IKEA, NO more laundry baskets.(10 f'n yrs!)  He saw this vlog and thought it would be fun.... thank you!  Could u 2 do a vlog on roomba vacuum?  He can afford one and their round like your dome home and I hate to sweep...
Love your new kitchen both. But your cat stole the show.🤣👍🥰🥰
Good job guys it looks bloody amazing I want that home lol. Looking forward to next vids take care and chow for now 👍
I love your new kitchen and your homedome looks so cozy and warmly inviting ... and your lovely cat seems to approve (bytheway - I love black cats, we had one too once .. she was equally lovely (and cheeky)) ...  Be happy in your Geodesic dome my friends ... I am looking forward towards the nex installment on tour video. .. Love you both !
Хлопці - ви чудові. Ви надихаєте, піднімаєте настрій. Нехай всі ваші плани здійсняться.Guys - you're great. You inspire, lift your spirits. Let all your plans come true.
Love you Dome home and it feels really cozy. Beautiful kitchen 👍😍 well done
Haha lol Eamon and Bec had the same problem with the Ikea kitchen. You guys are so entertaining. Thanks for the great vids and congratulations on your awesome dome.
Well done guys.  Kitchen looks great.❤👍🏾
Congrats! Absolutely fantastic, guys. Your combined energy can launch a space ship🤣 Love you lots. Thank you for your entertaining content and the effort that goes into everything. We appreciate you. ❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, that is a lot of solar. I live in Queensland Australia and only need 2 panels:-) Enjoy your new kitchen it looks awesome.
Really well done chaps, all looking great.
A cook book please that would be great as your food always looks amazing 🥰🥰🥰
Great video as usual.  Glad you managed to solve your Ikea problems to make a beautiful kitchen area.  Also always love the drone shots of the land.
You two are ALL THE FEEL GOOD VIBES!! So much positivity flowing! 😍🥳🥰
it just keeps getting better and better
I know the excitement of a new refrigerator. We were without a full sized fridge for a year and I am not even sure how we did it. YAY for new refrigerators!
Wow what an amazing job! Beautiful 🥰❄🏳️‍🌈
Just leaving a comment from the South of France to let you know your audience is worldwide.
We're living in a camper right now. I bet you're so excited to have high ceilings and not have your windows always be steamed up. It looks absolutely fabulous ❤️❤️
Have you seen Eamon and Bec with the IKEA kitchen? They have been struggling with the drawers big time 😆
ps you cannot have enough solar input so add more when can
Love watching your progress with your build, my Angel (fur baby) always gets excited when she sees Charlie and Eddie on screen so much so she tries to jump on the tv cabinet to play with them. I have to know, where did you come by that bench and stools combination? I love it.
Yup. Kitchen Envy. No IKEA in NZ. I KNOW. No civilization in NZ. …. Yet. I was watching this video and watching you move the fridge freezer. I realised you have a humongous advantage in being two men of similar builds, you can move heavy objects together more easily and share clothes ( although that might NOT be a plus thinking on it). By the way, your homemade “supports” will be so much better than any plastic leggettes. I love your beautiful home, you deserve the home love built. Just a hint, next time Madam Lilybum decides to go tree climbing, leave her there, because 9/10 they come down themselves. It’s very dangerous to go up a tree to just chase a naughty pussy ( I’m sure that’s the first time either of you have risked danger for one) it’s the very dark part of cats humour I’m afraid.
Fantastic kitchen guys, love the snickering over the "there are multiple holes that it can go in" comment 🤣.
Beautiful job!!!.
what are you gonna do about bears won't they rip through the tent
I have to ask. Do You Two ever rest? PLEASE! :)
One word - STUNNING!😍 Can't wait for the next video! Have an amazing week 🥰
😅💖💕
You two are just the cutest inspirational couple. Best wishes from the UK 🇬🇧
What about washing your pots and pan
Love the kitchen, and Lily tambien😊
Hi guys, I'm watching you put your kitchen together and the trouble that your having  assembling the units. Eamon and bec also had trouble assembling their kitchen which was also from Ikea,maybe Ikea isn't that good ,but I'm sure you kitchen will look lovely once it's finished, happy that you also worked out your problem  with the cabinets
I know you guys are my love bugs  sometimes ago did you say that you are going too build your new home , this is your New home too be
So Good !
Eamon and Bec, well, mostly Eamon,  had the same experience with “ simple” IKEA cabinets in their cabin build.  Almost exactly. Good job, guys.
Does the dome have doors that lock?
The kitchen is beautiful & I love the fridge! I can't wait till next week to see Tyler's project! I'm really looking forward to hearing all about it! I remember when you guys did the batteries in the RV that Tyler said he didn't want to bore us with too many details. I wonder if you might consider doing deep dive videos on some projects? Maybe on a second channel? Like T&T Tech Talk or something?! Lol Because like with the solar panels, I have a ton of questions I'd like to ask. Cost, projected life span, warranties, configuration set up etc. How low of temps can they handle? I'd like solar power too but the few companies I've called couldn't tell me how well their panels would work in Northern Alberta. A few weeks ago we had -56 and it's possible for us to get -60 before windchill at times. 💕
Kitchen looking really good but those missing bits! Gave you an excuse to have a special date night though. Are you putting an upstand at the rear of the worktop to stop things falling down the back? It's gonna happen! Lily is so naughty and I had exactly the same stuck up a tree challenge with our Misty some years ago.  Looking forward to seeing the solar set up working and of course the new, bigger stove. Hugs. D x
Lyly clearly loves the place you have obviously built for her. I'm hoping she'll let you stay with her.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Todd ...... never missing an innuendo.
Wow! Incredibly nice and cozy! You both did a good job because of team work! 🥰
Amazing  ... Amazing  ... can't wait to see what you do next 🤗
Beautiful. I am pretty sure Lily like any cat will always love the sink, at least until you turn it on
It's so cozy.  I want to live there.
Love the way your beautiful kitchen turned out!! Congratulations guys on a job well done!! Love the butcher block counter as well as the refrigerator!! Everything is coming out excellent!!❤️👍🍷
Love your video. Always look forward to see what you doing next. Much love
Where's the stove going?
Lily says "Thanks Dads for my wonderful sink. I love it 😻😻"
‘Multiple holes’…I am absolutely cracking up watching this!!!!
You guys are priceless…love lilly shoots
What a beautiful kitchen, island counter, fridge, and dining area set-up. Great job T&T. God bless.
Investing in different streams of income in other not to depend on government for funds and avoid all the chitchat about the inflation bla bla bla
Hi Guys!!  I stayed up super late just so I could watch this video LOL.  I absolutely adore how your home is coming together! And Lily is not the only one who thinks your country sink is to die for!(well, maybe not literally, but you get the picture!!)  So good to see how much you two are enjoying your DomeHome!  💖💖💖
I love watching you guys videos of that beautiful geodome home.. My question is, are those walls just flat out soft material even for exterior? If so how do you avoid bears and what now?.. 👀👀 You guys are just the cutest couple too! And I'm so happy about your beautiful cute kitchen 😍😍😍🙏🏼🙏🏼
I think the Rubbermaid tot bath clip should be included every week! 😋😅😅💜 Kitchen looks amazing 🤩
It's early Monday morning and I've got a busy week ahead. Seeing the kitty playing in the sink has made it seem a little easier. ☺️
I loved it OMG its amazing
It's a house or dome but its more its your home
I love how you two work together. The kitchen looks beautiful!! Can't wait til next week! Stay safe.
this is so great! I'm loving your channel!
As a professional interior decorator, let me say "well done" on your design accomplishments so far!  You are right....it"s very difficult & challenging to plan & design round interiors...but if it"s done properly, it can look outstanding.  So hats off to your creativity & style acumen!  Can't wait to see your next design & decorating plans!  Also love your 3 fur design associates!!! Love you guys....keep living the dream!!!
Blown away by all the work you’re getting done.  Congrats.🍾🎉
This was absolutely my favorite episode so far you guys looked like you were really feeling at home.. Thank you as always for bringing us along and make it my Sunday ritual happen once again..
More than two salad dressings in the new refrigerator! 🎉🙌🏼 You two are “wild”! 😂 💛
If it's silly, but works...then it isn't silly. It looks like the way that I 'exactly' measure!  Excellent job on your kitchen, and there is nothing quite like the satisfaction of a project that turns out like you envisioned. Also, I'm pretty sure that half of the reason that anyone goes to IKEA is to eat out!
Love your kitchen, and such a cool looking fridge.
The joys of IKEA building.  #ifeel4u
That is absolutely georgeous.  I am loving the colours.  My house is white and pine and some small bits of blue and green -really suitable for the hot climate here.  If you want to keep puss out of the sink, put some water in it.  Take care and I'll see you next week.
Such a beautiful job , I love the kitchen area,  you are both so talented . Great video thank you....
Don’t you know IKEA is crap!  All their furniture has issues!  That’s why it’s cheap.
Looking gorgeous! Oh and the kitchen too! Are you going to have a stove or cooktop?
Hi Tyler and Todd, I just recently found your videos and am absolutely hooked and can’t wait to see the next one!  You both work so hard and I  am very impressed at how self sufficient you are. Also intrigued at how you found your ten acre site in the middle of the forest? Here in the U.K. there are so many restrictions, planning applications, hoops to jump through etc that it wouldn’t be allowed! Did you have to apply for planning permission? Either way I really admire your ingenuity and determination. I also love the way that you get along together, so respectful and dignified! Love your fur babies too! Till the next time, keep warm and snug in your gorgeous home.
Hi guys...great video!   Kitchen is amazing....congrats!    Do you like your air fryer?  I'm considering buying one.....thanks!
The kitchen is really really nice… great job!👍💕💕💕
❤❤🌈🏳‍🌈
I love you two!!!! You are the highlight of my week!!! And it's not what you do.... it's because it's you two!!! I look forward again to the traveling videos...because that means the world is sane again!!!! A world with Tyler and Todd makes all the other bullshit tolerable!
Your kitchen area looks amazing.  Have a great week with lots of luck in the coming week.
Your dogy is great...no reaction what ever happend...love it...its like "well I have seen everything...so what. no need to react on this" great.
Cats need to perch.. they need to be up above their surroundings to have a place to go to feel safe and in control of their safety.  You can build a couple cat towers and even a cat walk that she can travel and hang out and watch all the goings on below.  That is why she is up on the tables and in the sink and in the tree.. she needs to go "up'.. You guys got some serious building skills.  excited to see what you can come up with for her to be happiest. =D
Your opening drone shots of the woods really underline your isolation, the beauty of the forest and how cold it is. Todd’s dirty mind is sooo refreshing! And probably the only way to deal with so many of the projects and frustrations you’ve faced. The kitchen looks fabulous. Sounds like you need to buy another one of those t-shirts. I’m so impressed by the fact you can measure and get it right first time! I can measure the same thing three times and get three different measurements! And I’ve never worked out what I do wrong; and I’m 66!
Both of u r lovely, especially Tyler 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃💋
I love your videos. I've been watching for a while but this is my first comment! I'd love to see more of Lilly(if she is cooperative, lol). I'm a huge cat fan and black cats are my absolute favorite! Love you both!!
Lilly💖🐈‍⬛💖
OMG you guys are the best! Watching you religiously from Aus!
I love that you have added a kitty to your family. They can be a challenge but bring tons of joy into a home. Please consider leash training her then when you go on a trip again in future she can join your walks without getting up to mischief or into trouble in a strange place - they can be quite single minded at times and love high places no matter what age they are. I hope Charlie is doing well and it's wonderful how easily they accepted Lily into their space, the upstairs / downstairs feeding space is cool. My dogs would just eat the kitty food 🤣.   Love the progress you have made to the land, you must be so proud of all the milestones achieved. Everything looks cosy and comfy, I want to come and visit 😊.
The kitchen looks amazing!💜💜💜
I love you guys! Wish I had a relationship like yours! Lol... loved it when you just panned away from Todd & onto Lilly! 🤣🤣 And Too turning Ty's comments dirty with just a smile gets me every time! Thanks for making my Sunday better, boys! Kisses to all of you! 😘😘😘😘😘
Awww you guys have Garam Masala spice too! <3
Just put a cat bed in the farm sink, and "free will loveable Lilly" can call it her spot! I have 2 like her, and they make every day better than it already is.  Your home is really coming together nicely.  Your Hard work is sure paying off.
O my goodness.  Now I have to wait a whole week !!!!!!!  Way to long.........waayyyyy.  If you can't tell I will counting of the days till Sunday.
Oh my gosh! The kitchen is beautiful!
cute little kitchen.
Save the pussy!
Your energy, creativity and ingenuity is amazing guys !!
❄️♥️
Great job. I feel like you are creating better videos. They should be getting longer retention rates. Keep up the great work.
Hello Tyler and Todd. I am a new subscriber. I so love the both of you❤
Would love to hear more about your fridge- both first impressions and a review in a few months!
Have to comment again Lilly is just adorable I have a black kitty Xena who's always on the kitchen benches Cuddles to all your beautiful furbabies xx
It's the Lilly show!!! :) ... I like what you said at the end there. It sounds like you needed to set down some roots, and now it's happening. :)
Tyler….you are so shady, and I love it!!!! 😂😂😂
💪💪✌👍👏👏👏👏👏 from Finland❣🌸🌹🌹🌸
Dome is looking fantastic You should be proud 😍 Maybe Miss Lilly needs a harness & lead for outside walks xx
You two are amazing 🥰🥰🥰    So where will the bathroom go?
Love the new kitchen! Don't Change! lol We Love you the way you are! l  Lily is tryin to steal the show and the Boys are so Good!
As an IKEA employee in the U.S. (Merriam, KS to be specific) give us some grace as many of us are overworked and getting products from EU takes forever currently. It sucks to have to work in that anxiety riddled environment for what has been going on 2 years now….. 💞
Guys, I so look forward to Sundays. The kitchen is awesome
You need a induction cooktop.
Always watch the boys..............have fun building that kitchen.....all looks great!!
Very comfortable in an environment in place. Keep to learning from yours 😘😀👌
Love it..... where did you get the frig....
So funny because I made exactly the same mistake with the drawers in my Ikea Kitchen 😂 and ofcourse we also missed a few things and had to go back twice😅 but it looks really great 🤩 ( and when you complain you get those free meals tickets from Ikea 🤪)
My favorite couple on you tube! I’m A 60 yr old gramma! Y’all make me smile❤️
The dome is so open and airy and the kitchen is lovely.  I love it. Cats usually come down when they get hungry.  😊
Aren't there black bears in NS?
Awesome video as always did I miss the stove?
You did an amazing job on the kitchen! It doesn’t matter what goes wrong you two always manage to find a way to make it work. I loved the farmhouse sink, it is so much nicer than the old stainless steel ones. Lilly is just so cute, up a tree, in a sink chasing her tail, or just eating with her big brothers! I look forward to next weeks edition.
Awesome vlog! The kitchen looks fabulous!!! You two are SO energetic!
Looks like the frozen tundra to me.
Love the progress you’ve made…..so impressed with how determined and adaptable you both are. It looks like you’re really far out into the wilderness. So, I’m wondering if you have an address? (I’m not looking for it btw, I’m not a stalker😉) but, just wondering do you get mail delivered? And how do contractors and delivery people find you? I don’t want details that would jeopardize your security or privacy…...I just wonder, guess it’s the grandma in me. 🤷‍♀️ For instance when you use power tools, if something went wrong and you had to call for emergency help…..how would they find you? Your critters are so much fun and I adore Miss Lily.♥️Thank you for giving the world a loving family to watch and cheer on. I am a fan. 🥰
What it takes to build a healthy a relationship like yours for me is, 1-Having to put behind my Religion and beliefs 2-Having to spend years to find someone who's interested in men let alone interested in me and vice versa 3-Having to be in agreement with him to build up our lives towards what I call TRUE happiness  And I'm willing to do anything to achieve that but then an insane amount of risk, uncertainty and disbelief is gonna block my way and I just don't know if it's even worth doing it anyway so, someone tell me what to choose, please..
Really looking fantastic! With each new project completed it's looking so cozy and beautiful and warm. (Btw love the booty/slippers) Always love seeing Charlie and Eddie and Lily. Glad you were able to get Lily out of that tree! Hope she doesn't try that again. Looking forward to seeing the next installment. Take care and stay safe. - Hugh
Lmaooo I was thinking "is Tyler going to use that clip again?" and then you said it.
You Guys are so precious, talented and an inspiration to all of us!! I love your humor and your kindness and respect for each other!! And…. Lily wanted me to tell you: she’s volunteering for dish washing!!!! 😆😂😆 God bless y’all forever!!! 🙏🏻💙🌟😉😉🌟💙🙏🏻
You guys are simply magnificent !!!
Nice job looks great! From a senior in Ontario.
Does the dome eventually get bathroom?
Seeing the 'kids' all eat together is not only adorable but rather amazing!  Just goes to show the incredible peaceful vibe you guys have in your new home :)
“Multiple holes” and the look on Todd’s face is priceless.
I love that tub clip!!  😆😆 Guys......AMAZING!!  The place looks straight out of a magazine!  You two can accomplish anything!!  Can't wait to see the solar go up.  It will be such a game changer!
You guys are SUCH AN INSPIRATION !!  I've  been living off grid for a while but ive always wanted a dome home... I see one in my future thanks you you guys!! I just love y'all so much💜💜
Like your new kitchen, si do Lily😄. Love the 3 of them have meal togerher. And so many solar panels! Si good start fir the year!
To keep lilly from jumping into the sink lay à towel over in with two or three pieces of silver wear on the towel, when she hits the towel the silver wear will fall into the sink and make a loud noise and she will be frightened, and maybe never do it again. It worked for me.
Absolutely killed your kitchen design. Love it! Lilly approved!!!
I'm so glad that you both do this. I look forward every Sunday to seeing your progress.
Absolutely loving the new space you guys ! Can’t wait to see the final results 🥰
Amaretto and Grand Marnier in your wet bar! I stan.
Screwing and lots of holes.  Sounds like this is becoming a bit X rated - LOL.  Kitchen looks great.  Not sure why the geod is not your permanent home.  That along with the solar reminds me of Tangerine Dream back from the 60s and 70s or John Denver in Aspen which is when this whole save the planet movement began.  You guys are becoming eclectic which is a good thing.  Also great to know that you are nearby Halifax which appears to be another one of Canada's greats.  Thanks from south of the boarder - Canada's border that is..
Better than expected! Gorgeous, boys!
Love it....😍😍😍
Love this!
It wouldn't surprise me if you had teh plumbing working by next week!  Thanks again for an interesting experience.
💖🐱‍👤
Love you guys
Thanks so much for staying positive and finishing those projects. You guys are the best and an inspiration to others !
Loving the kitchen ❤️❤️❤️have a great week
“Multiple holes it can go in”…. Oh my, Tyler,  please tell me more!!!🤣🙃
Your new home looks so nice! I wonder how long you could live there if you didn't build the cabin? Good work,  guys!
Amazing result.....💗♥️❤️💗
Yea solar!
So so happy for you two and your journey with your fur babies.. so inspiring.. I want a dome home too with your view.. we live on Vancouver island .. with the best views ever besides yours .. fingers crossed we could do the same❤️❤️.. love and enjoy you sooo sooo much Xoxoxoxo
Have you thought about bear repellent and other animals that might “break-in”.  Really don’t want to hear about the animal attack that chased you away.  Assuming you got away which means the last video upload was your last transmission.
Your kitchen is stunning!   Next time, open a tin of tuna and your kittie will come down...... or shake Lily's food bowl.....
Great job, Guys....can't wait to visit!...😅
Anyone wanna live in a dome with me?
Did I miss a stove and oven other than the air fryer?
How dare you!!!! Ending the episode like that!!! Uhhhhh this is going to be a long week!!
*lili scammed you: she invented a new game to amuse herself...you two were the pawns.*
Omg!  The solar panels are being installed.  Can't wait.  Love the kitchen. Your home is so nice and so thought out.  By the way... I used my jigsaw for the first time this week.  Thought I would share.
Looking fabulous. I've had the same issues with IKEA from time to time, but usually it is all good and workable. Those meals, ... your IKEA definitely is an upgrade from mine!  What a cliff-hanger, ... cannot wait for Sunday!
Watched your vid again and realized I never commented on the kitchen 🤦🏻‍♀️ It is lovely! That fridge is cool and the high top table and stools are so stylish and practical. Well done guys!
Multiple holes??? How so?? Lol
Looking more and more cozy every week! Good luck trying to "train" Lillith out of hanging out in that sink lol What's the update on the sauna....like every week I see that it looks finished and I'm surprised you haven't shown it off yet!
You guys bring me joy. Enjoy your new kitchen.
Great job.
This episode is "so good" 😄😄😄
The new kitchen looks amazing, guys!  Quick question…is that ice inside the windows going to cause a mold issue in your walls?
I miss going to Ikea!
Your kitchen looks absolutely fabulous - can't bdlieve how good it looks.
You guys are so creative! Thanks as always for taking us along!
I hate my flatbottom sink.
lol basically IKEA is shit! That is the ehos in United States of America.
Hi guys, Todd’s ‘I feel cheap’ in the Rubbermaid tub is the funniest thing you have ever said! Hilarious! You are doing a great job on the geodesic dome too!
Beautiful!!!  Again, a great video to complete my Sunday.
guys it looks fab!!!
You have now been officially indoctrinated into "CAT OWNERSHIP".   I have not had to get any of mine out of a tree, but crawling in to cramped spaces under the house, many times.  Cats are so wonderful.
The kitchen looks amazing!  Love the refrigerator, may I ask where you got it?  So happy you were able to rescue Lilly!  We are a two cat household and we never know what they are going to get themselves into!  The dome is really coming together, it looks very cozy and inviting!  Look forward to next weeks video!  Take care guys!  Much love and big hugs!❤️
I love how you two look at each other. Like you’re seeing each other for the first time and falling in love again.
I've really enjoyed your videos, and learning about being self-sufficient. It's made me consider veganism. I have an odd question after watching your latest videos, I've wondered since your shower and facilities are outside, and it gets very cold up there, why don't they freeze? Keep up the great vids!👍👍😊😊👍👍
Great video! The only negative was when it was over and I have to wait an entire week for updates! LOL! I'm curious, do you utilize your wood stove to cook foods that we would use a conventional stove/oven for?
I just love it, I want to move in, can I?????love and hugs ❤️🇦🇺
Always so nice watching your videos… helps put the Sunday scarves on hold for a little bit 😅
So Good...
Woot woot! Loving your kitchen and vibe island! You 2 inspire me with your style choices! Thank you dearly for sharing! Loving every minute if it as always!
You may consider puttin' a 2 or 3" backsplash to kepp from knockin' stuff behind by accident.
Does Tyler *always* have a cap on?  Is it attached?
Guys, Todd’s ‘I feel cheap’ in the Rubbermaid container is the funniest thing you have ever said! Hilarious! You are doing a great job on your property!
I am truly astonished how your space is really coming together. So amazing.
I love it. I love how the IKEA kitchen turned out, it is beautiful! I love Todd’s glasses (lol). all looks absolutely gorgeous. You guys are FN amazing!
Is there no stove?
OOPSY!!! Lily likes thhe sink as well
I love you guys you are so funny and entertaining. You need a show. Hello HGTV you need to sign these two.
"....there are multiple holes it can go in....."   THATS WHAT SHE SAID!
Good job, guys.  Love the look of the kitchen. Each week your home is getting better and better.
Wow great job guys 🥰
I will share with you some kitty info…. No one has ever found a dead cat in a tree. They always come down by themselves! Lol your kitty was calling you to join in the fun.
Damn! Totally dig your digs!!!! um, you know, couples should never do Ikea together...
Where is the stove?
Breathable plastic fabric... that sounds like a oxymoron
Nice job guys,like the sink also!!! please hug the dogs for this granny they are precious,did you get a haircut??
So exciting!
Awesome couple 🥰
I love the kitchen!!! It is all wonderful but I really like the retro fridge. The cutest, though, is Lily in the sink:)
OMG Tyler and Todd!! Everything looks SO BEAUTIFUL 🤩🤩🤩 You Two continually give Amazing Videos, and everything you set your minds to comes out Gold!! So impressed with your new home, you both inspire me so much! Keep up the great work Tyler and Todd, Y'all are crushing it 🤩✌️✌️✌️ Blessings from🇺🇸
Aww she was scared 💕 love how much you boys deserve date out fabulous memories memories together priceless dome is lovely proud. 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾💋💋💋 blessings hugs 🌙✨🕯✨
PLEASE Keep the kitty in doors as much as you can. Cats claws are curved back so although it is very easy for them to climb up a tree it is VERY hard for them to climb down unless they go backwards which is not a natural movement for them.
Oh my gosh, LOVE LOVE LOVE that kitchen! Especially the fridge and sink! Oh and the island seating...gosh it looks beautiful guys!! ✌️❤️😁 -Stephanie
Lily has excellent dad's))
I wish Sundays were everyday.  I can't get enough of you two , I mean you five. Love the kitchen and bar. I see new draperies also. Now the solar. This is all so exciting.  Happy you had a nice dinner together.  💘 See you Sunday.  😘
I Love It!!  I now want a geodesic dome…thanks guys!!  OMG!! Looks Amazing!!  Great Job!!
Awesome
First of all, I can't tell you how much I love your channel, for so many reasons. Mostly you all are so adorable! I also love how you process together and make things look do-able. Please don't teach Lily to stay out of the sink, she will in her own time! She is the mischievous one in the house(someones got to do it), I have a young female pup, Nele, but I call her Nene Swagger Fish because she walks with a swagger and puts her head underwater trying to catch fish (she only catches poor toads and swaggers around with their legs dangling from her mouth, the poor things) anyway, your Lily is my Nele and they have someway to live that bring us so much joy (and frustration) but their silliness makes it all worth while!  I will be sharing your channel, thanks for so much Sunday joy! Oma
Where did you get that little bar table and chairs?
Oh my Tyler! I broke out in a sweat watching you model that green shirt! Love the retro fridge and the farm house sink! Oh and feel free to show Todd's Rubbermaid tub clip any old time! 😊
The kitchen looks fantastic guys. Along with the rest of the place. You guys are so right. You deserve this nice place to call your own. The R/V filled the need for you.  But a place to feel like a home. Is important for your mental well-being.  Hope tomorrow goes well for you guys. Especially you Tyler. You have been so good waiting on the solar field to get up and running.
Love LOVE the kitchen, island and dining/office area!!!! Yay for the awesome looking refrigerator too!!!! ❤️
IT LOOKS SOOOO GOOD!!! STEADY ON BOYZZZZ!!!
😁 Thank you Tyler and Todd for having the closed captioning for the hearing impaired turned on!!✌️#davesandersstepdaughter 🇺🇲
Most east coast thing said in this video: we’ll just put a dishpan in the sink.   My Nan always had a dishpan in her sink 😂
I am just amazed at how the dome turned out! You two can make anything Beautiful!!!
You guys are brilliant, brilliant I tell you.
You know your living good when you have room for two flavors of salad dressing. I can only dream of that lol..BTW awesome countertop and sink
Kitchen is looking so good. I remember doing an IKEA kitchen many years ago and believe me yours went so much easier. Glad you were able to have an outing. We don’t have an IKEA in N.B so when this pandemic ends my first get away is Halifax. Family and a day at IKEA. Have an amazing week.
Let’s be honest, Lily is the true star of the show!! You guys are darling!!!
Is looking so pretty and homy💖💖
TO MY FABULOUS CANADIAN FRIENDS, ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE GAY?? I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. "CONGRATULATIONS" I AM A OLD 63 YEAR OLD QUEEN. SADLY, I HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND CHANGING TIME ON THE MICROWAVE IS A SAD STORY ALSO.LOL!! YOU GUYS ARE JUST WONDERFUL. ENJOY YOUR HARD WORK.I JUST LOVE CANADA. YES, IT'S A LITTLE WARMER HERE IN SAN DIEGO🌴 BUT I MISS THE SNOW.
Love the kitchen.  Lily stole the show and my heart!
Best tease ever , and I guessed it. I noticed you using the Jackery to power your tools during the kitchen build. And for the bathroom?  Asking for a friend.
Wow, love the kitchen❣️ The white with the butcher block top looks clean and yet warm and inviting.  The fridge is so cute❣️❣️❣️ The farmhouse sink really compliments the overall look.  I just hope Lily doesn’t have a “rude awakening” when you get running water or have the sink filled. 😳 😂🤣
I love seeing your videos each week and I look forward to them. The two of you are such a great couple and you make me laugh and brighten up my days. When you all start traveling again and find your way to Oklahoma I will be glad take you to dinner for a great German dinner. They do have veggie meals. Have a great week.
Your place is looking fantastic! Love you guys.
Your accomplishments together are to be commended. The true love, teamwork, frienship and support you give each other is truly special. It is heartfelt when I say thank you for brightening my day with your amazing videos. Keep following your dreams together you are a beautiful family.
It is looking amazing. I am excited to see the finished home. Have you thought about adding a small back edge to the countertop to prevent anything from falling behind the cabinets? You could just stain a piece of wood to match the general countertop color and attach it with a plate and screws and just finish it the same way as the countertop.
Omg!  I ❤️ how you ended this week with a sneak peak at what’s going to happen next week!  It’s like bing material without the material!  LoL  I look forward to Sundays to watch you guys!!  I’ve been following you guys for a super long time and this is the highlite of me week!
Great idea the larger fridge. I find that in all the RVs and other recreational vehicles what is most sadly lacking is a proper large fridge and cupboard space for cans and dry goods. I mean if you're somewhere on vacation why on earth would you want to be going to a store all the time. I found in your RVs the fridges were just too small. Especially since you eat such a plant based diet which has lots of fresh vegetables.  Isn't that right? The kitchen looks very nice but I wonder if you would not benefit from more cabinet space. Question: are you planning on building a mezzanine? I'm curious
Is the dome warm enough? I’m in the Northeastern U.S,. and have been considering a Dome home for a long time.I called a DH manufacturer to ask if it would be warm ( with insulation and heater stove) enough for a winter like this one and the representative  said no. I see you guys are wearing shorts ;) I am wondering if you could comment on how it is working for you warmth wise. It’s been sooooooo cold! Just found you and living my dream too- Love you guys.
Your dinner looked . . . so good!
Love it!!!!!
I love your videos ,you both work so hard and you’ve done so much on the land …your Dome kitchen is super …I can’t wait to see your next video ,you make my Sundays 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
What is the expectancy of a Dome life span on the material? I have just found y’all’s channel..  Lilly is keeping y’all on your toes.  ❤️❤️
I’m sure the info is here somewhere,but can anyone tell me what size this dome is ? Thanks so much in advance 🤗
Your new kitchen area is fabulous!  Is there any chance that an outdoor catio for Lily is in future plans?  She might love it.
Keep those winter forest aerial shots coming, please.   They are so gorgeous.   You should do some generic ones that don’t show your home and sell them as stock footage/images!!    I love the way Lilly just immediately claimed the sink as hers.  You should cover/tape over the drain hole until you plumb the sink so she doesn’t accidentally get her head stuck in it while catting around…trust me, it can happen.  🕳+🐱=🚒🧰💵.    That trapped in a tree business is child’s play compared to dealing with a head stuck in a hole.   Hello hunky fireman with a hammer…bye bye beautiful new farm sink.
Love love love your home simply  BEAUTIFUL....YOUR DECOR IS AWESOME...YOUR TASTE  IS THE BEST...XOXOXO
From one RVer to another.. that kitchen is awsome! I have two cats and a dog in my RV and I love how you rescued sweet Lilly out of the tree.. you guys are the hot firemen, lol. OMG! You got your solar panels!
You guys have done an AMAZING job. I mean, wow! You should be so proud. I’m proud of you both! And I can barely remember how to replace the batteries in my electric toothbrush, so watching you assemble these cabinets seems like rocket science to me.
Looks gorgeous.  When does the bathroom go in.
Yes I agree it must be different trying to design in the dome but so far I see fabulousness!
You guys are just too cute!
Idea: Trim the sink cutout piece to fit into the sink as a cutting or filler board, then add a drawer pull or handle on each side, making it easy to insert and remove. Doubles as a serving tray.  If you do not do something like this, the sink is going to be full of cat forever.
The KITCHEN!   I've been so curious about how the kitchen would fit into the circular floor plan.  We hope to start on our dome in the Spring, and I have so many ideas for the layout,  but I'm learning from you boys how different it is to have this round, open layout.   Everything you have done is fabulous and inspiring to us that we can do this project (even though I'm still intimidated by it, not gonna lie!) We love you guys and can't wait to see your SOLAR PANELS going in.   ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 Kjärstin & Ty
I love, love, love the kitchen!
Wow the kitchen looks so great!! Thank you for sharing your life and love with us
Tyler and Todd you have done it. I have no words left to tell you everything that could be said about you and your dreams coming true. Your dome looks so comfortable. Bob and I have our coffees ready, snacks at our side and ready for next Sunday. xoxo
so beautiful. I love it. You guys are so awesome.
I am obsessed with the island. Where did you get it from?
Thank you very much for your videos on YouTube. I have been watching your videos one year. You have a beautiful geodesic dome home in the forest. I wish you all the best! Greetings from Helsinki, Finland, Europe!
OMG, such a beautiful job! And Lilly is so adorable! I think you'll have to build another sink as it appears she has made that one "her" space...lol. I have her four year old twin sister so I can relate to Lilly's escapades. Love and Blessings to you guys and your wonderful family from Rich in Marion Ohio!
👏👏💪💪 Kitchen looks great! OmG the suspense. Can’t wait; excitement.for next weeks solar panel video. Best Vibes! 🌟🤩
Holy crap there’s an IKEA in Halifax area? Man that city has changes since I left. Where did they put that?
WOW JUST WOW ... I love the kitchen..IT’S SLAMMING❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Awesome kitchen!  Can't even rate what I like best -- the cool retro-looking fridge, the island with stools that can be stored under it, the sink, the countertop, the baskets, the pet feeding station.  Simply marvelous!  I love your decorating theme of white with natural colors.  You guys should have your own magazine!
Been having such a hard time mentally but every Sunday I know I get to watch you guys and it really lifts my spirits and inspires me thanks so much for every episode ❤️❤️❤️
We need to see this cartwheel competition Todd mentioned ☺️🤸🤸‍♂️
Hi loves...
Good  I love this kitchen!!!!!!!!
I know right speaking of HOT FIRE FIGHTERS ...I smelled gas in my apartment a year back..  2 fire truck pulled up in short order,  ....OMFG ❣️❣️❣️❣️ it was Chippendales in suites, I was flush the entire time having those 4 hunks in my abode....❣️❣️❣️
Great job guys!  I love watching you each week. I was about to ask “where’s the stove” and then I heard you mention the Airfryer.  I forgot. You have that mastered.   Stay warm
Multiple holes it can go in you had me rolling on the floor like I love the look on his face you guys are great take care
Your home is looking amazing, love it. And Lilly is adorable, you should get her a climbing tree for inside so she can practice her getting down skills 😂. ❤️
Oh Lily soooo cute. Nice job guys.
Men with tools ♥️❤️‍🔥♥️.. multiple holes that you can drill😱😂😂😂 wow that kitchen is awesome & thos Solar panels😱😱♥️
Wow, loved this week’s video (actually love them all). The kitchen looks great. You two have such fabulous style. I love watching the team work you have with every project. However, this week Lily stole the show. ❤️🐈‍⬛
The Dome is looking so beautiful and peaceful!!  Great job you two but then again I had no doubt that it would be coming from you both.  Enjoy and have a great week.
You’re both sooooo wonderful! Another great job!!! Thank you for sharing with all of us!
Bwahaha you guys are so funny-love love. Take care.❤️🤭😁👏
It looks beautiful 😍
Gorgeous!  So cozy!
Everything looks beautiful. By the way, where's your dining set from?
It’s one of the things I love about you guys, you make things work. Great job
That kitchen is beautiful.  Great job guys!    It’s really coming together as a nice and cozy home space.  (BTW…..nice rescue of sweet Lily) ❤️.
I'm telling you we need  "I feel cheap" merch.
I don’t see where they are gonna put a bathroom in there
Hi guys, love your vids. Try putting a little water in your sink. Hope that teacher her a new thing.
love your videos.... keep them coming...
Multiple holes...knowing looks at each other!!!  LOL!
Looks awesome guys, great job 😊
❤❤❤❤❤. See you Sunday!👍👍👍👍👍👍🍀🍀💕💕
Check on Nate and Kara's last video, they got a contraption that is for under the sink and a container for the water since is winter an they are in very cold weather, looks nice and practical for temporary solution.
Amazing guys, what you've done is so great. And btw, music choices in your videos are impeccable. Stay that cute.
The tote/bath is always gonna make me laugh. 😂Great job on the kitchen!
The dome is looking so good and love the kitchen everything is coming along so good great job see you next Sunday 👍👍
Just curious, are you able to keep Charlie and  Eddie from getting into Lilly’s litter box?  Your new home is looking sooooooo inviting, and cozy 🥰
I loved it when u two did a little dance. Made me smile so much. Look forward to seeing u both. U r such a lovely couple. Xxx
The giggles @multiple holes had me laughing!
Omg can't wait.
It looks amazing!
I’m so glad I came across your sight!  Love what you are doing!
So happy for you guys!!!😃👏Everything looks so damn good!!!😉👌👍❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Run some water in the kitchen sink to cover the bottom and your kitty will not think it is a good place to lay.  Wont take it long to realize it either.  Love your dome and wwill keep up with you on the work your both doing on it.
Great build boys i Work at a kitchen build place Paris kitchens to bad not close I could have helped you .
Lily is going to keep you boys hopping. LoL what a scamp! Looks great guys - fridge is really cool.
Your set up is seriously so amazing. If it were in a snow free area it would be 100% perfection. I could work at that dining table for life. Love what you're doing. Keep it up.
“ So good!” 😉
Just when I think you have made your home as beautiful as you can, you just make more magic. It is just amazing.  You are both incredible. Super video. Breathtaking . I love your home.  I look for you every week.  I love Sundays. Thank you. ❤
Luxury off grid! You two rock! Your space looks amazing. I held my breath for a second while you cut that beautiful counter for the sink….but why….you two know exactly what you are doing! So proud of you! Until next Sunday sweet boyz!
🐈♥️🐈♥️🐈♥️🐈♥️🐈👬🌈💯🐕♥️🐕♥️
I don't see a cooktop or oven... Are you using an air fryer for your oven needs and perhaps an induction plate for your stovetop needs? Turned out great😀 👍🌈👍🌈
Beautiful beautiful living areas wow even with the "multiple holes"?????? ✌💖💪🌈🌻🎅🚌👍
Does anyone read the comments before they make their's or do as I do, just start: Where are the Potty and shower?  Do you have to drudge through the ICE and SNOW and when you finally make it U/R locked down?  Lilly needs a cardboard box;  all my cats have special hiding spots but one loves boxes,  least expenditure cardboard boxes, FREE!
Nice choice of kitchen items.
Once the water is connected and working, she will find out in short order what that great container is really for! Lol! Congrats on the kitchen build and finally having a refrigerator! But the perk of living where you are is the weather provides you with access to a great “freezer access”! I’m 75 and from the east coast. When I grew up there were still plenty of “iceboxes” in use! In the winter a lot of people had vented window boxes hanging out the window of the apartment that did not get direct sun and could be used as additional freezer space! In fact the first year I was married we couldn’t afford a refrigerator and I made one for our porch here in Wisconsin! Worked like a charm! Best of luck going forward!
Where did you get the island with the stools that store underneath? Love this so much
How do you charge your garbage can batteries?
😂😂🤣 Love the rubbermaid tag!  Your home is coming together nicely.  Totally love the retro frig, too!   Congratulations on making it past the "Ikea Wonderland of Mismatched", fantastic looking kitchen with the ready made cutting board, so creative.  Thanks for sharing, can't wait for next Sunday.  🥰😎
Your kitchen is lovely!!  Ikea = idiot proof?  I beg to differ.
Love the kitchen.
Kitchen came together so well! You guys have tremendous vision for your projects. ✌🏼
Common problem with Ikea kitchens- missing parts and crappy parts.
You guy's it looks absolutely amazing!! Way to go♥️
What a lovely and exciting project. You guys are the best. Congratulations on your new kitchen! ❤️
Beautiful job! Looks amazing! What other appliances will you use to cook your meals?
Your home is really coming together! Love the fridge! How did you guys decide on that particular model? Lilly is a hoot! ;)
Hi Guys, I know you love Lilly, but as an official cat person, you really have to break her of sitting in your sink or even letting her on your table or countertops.  An easy way to do that is to get a couple of spray bottles with water.  Tell her first and if she doesn't listen, then spray her.  There is only 1 breed of cat that I know of that likes water; Lilly is not one of them.  The reality is she is your cat, and it's your house, but in the long run, it may be best to get a spray bottle.  I'm just sayin'   Carmelle from Minnesota
Lilly’s Lounge. It appears that she has not only stole your hearts but she has taken over the dome and claimed it as hers. Climbing trees, however, is not her forte. Thanks for another fun video.
Looks beautiful 😍 👌 ❤
omfg, I cried laughing at the comment of having a cat is way different to having  a dog :D
I am an old guy 79yrs old, I am so impressed with both of you two. And you cute too. I can't believe all the things you done. My partner does most of the stuff around our house. I do most of the cooking and planning. Keep it up. We enjoy your videos.
I am looking forward to a full fridge!  Your home is beautiful.  See you next Sunday.
Starting to look so comfy in there 👍🏻🤓
❤❤❤❤
Lilly rocks!!!
Yay for that gorgeous kitchen!
The kitchen looks awesome guys, love it! It still blows me away how fast you accomplish everything. I had that same countertop when I lived in Spain, it's beautiful. Cats do love sinks! I have 1 cat who will only drink out of my bathroom sink :) Wondering if you're going to have an oven or mini-oven?
Legit, my new escape is these videos while cooking the upcoming week's prep.  I want this lifestyle for myself.
Looks beautiful,  you two have done an incredible job 🥰 Will you be installing a Stove/Oven ? I have watched from the beginning can't wait to see what you have planned ! Be Safe 💙
It looks amazing but I didn’t see a bathroom or cook stove
The Kitchen is beautiful, and i love the island table. You guys did an excellent job.
Kitchen looks beautiful!!!
You 2 are fun to watch.  But it’s the middle of winter and you are showing off your legs.  Just goes to show how great the insulation and heat are for your dome!
Do you guys use slow cookers? I could see that for you while you're busy working
Having out together a lot of Ikea...you guys are couple goals. My hubby gets frustrated with 10 minutes and he's done. The dome looks amazing. It's so cozy and wonderful. It's great seeing it go from just a base into a wonderful home.
Such a cliffhanger! I’m so happy to see your progress. Stay safe and warm. 😘
Guys it looks like home.very well staged keeping the windows as you enter you are dr
ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.........no stove?
you guys have such a gift, it all looks amazing!
Great video. Love that Lilly and the dogs eat breakfast together at separate levels. Lilly is hilarious.
I was wondering if you guys would add a stove or an oven and then I remembered y'all are vegan.
Lilly stole this video.
Beautiful 💚💚💚💚
Amazing! I love you, your pets and your videos! You are so beautiful and sophisticated!!! ❤️ You've done a fantastic job! Super impressive! 🤯Your channel blew my mind! ❤️
Cool to see how far you guys have come and really nice to see you supporting Irish. The skills you'll have by the end of this will be crazy
It looks Great!!
Guys it's looking awesome your both so talented take care xx
I am soooo happy for you guys. You two have turned that Dome into a beautiful home. Great hard work guys. I love your vlogs and seeing how hard yall work everyday to make your dream home and design's come to life, very inspiring. Congrats again.
I just LOVE that you two put soooomuch forethought into your design. ...'multiple holes' 🤣🤪  leave it to Todd.  The place is looking fabulous!!!  Thanks for completing my Sunday ❤🙏😀 STEP UP @Ikea
Awesome sauce 😂. Love love love you guys. And thank you for another video. Peace and blessings.
Love your channel. Love the dome and the kitchen looks fantastic. Are you putting in a cook top/oven or is the air fryer your cooking source?
How easy would it be for a bear to get in your home?
It's beautiful. I truly wish a home magazine would feature your dome home.  Be Blessed and safe Kate Olivia
You guys have really done a lot of work!
So enjoy watching you both & the fur babies. & Laugh Everytime about the bathtub pic. Stay warm, hugs
Kitchen looks great.  May I suggest attaching a backsplash to keep stuff from falling behind the cabinets, possibly with a shelf on top where the back edge matches the curve of the wall.  I lived with an opening where stuff kept disappearing into and it was quite disgusting when I finally cleaned that area.
“Do you feel good? Um, I feel cheap” 🤣
You are so sexually obnoxious 🤮🤮
Gosh! I love your videos. I am sad when they end, waiting for next Sunday ❤️. You both are so talented and have done a fantastic job. Your place is going to be gorgeous 🥰. I love your channel so much. Thank you both for taking us with you on this journey. Much love from the USA 💕💓
Where did you get the island?
Haha I love watching you two. So many awesome projects. All I can think of is the fact that you’ve completed all of the challenges of your builds and systems on the property yet you still seem so surprised when you do something as little as cut a counter top the correct size lol. Shows humility.  Hope to cross paths at IKEA sometime. Cheers.
I like the ‘fridge, can you tell us more about it?
It’s ok Todd, Eamon & Bec had the same problem when they built their cabinets!
GORGEOUS KITCHEN!!  (Have you watched Eamon and Beck’s kitchen assembly video? 😄 I don’t think IKEA will be calling either of you for sponsorship… 😂🤣)
It’s really exciting to see it all come together and to share your excitement.
The view of the kitchen and dining area with the dogs laying there with the view out the window was so homey and inviting. I stopped the video so I could just go aaaaw, it was so bright and calming. I could be happy there. Hope all goes well from here on out. Love seeing what you get into.
Wow … the kitchen looks amazing, I can see it featured in a magazine!!! Thx for posting ❤️
Every inch of the dome is looking so nice.  Stay warm love you guys.
Good cliffhanger...looking forward to seeing the solar come together!
Oh guys Lilly’s might get her head stuck in the sink hole. Please put something in there just in case 😱
It looks beautiful guys. It took a lot of skill,patience, energy, and time to complete.. Kung Fu  stuff.
how beautiful your new one is looking 😊❤️ Tyler and Todd everything looks incredible, with those beautiful furniture, greetings from Tampico Tamaulipas Mexico 🇲🇽😘🌹 I love you
Golly,  I'm constantly amazed on how you guys work.  The dome really looks terrific..So happy for you that you finally have a really comfortable place to call "home".  A little more permanent than an RV.
I just found your channel and I love you guys! Your story of building your dream home is absolutely amazing.
The dome is coming together so nice it looks so gorgeous great choices of materials the refrigerator is my favorite. 😍 Busted up laughing when you yelled for the hot fire fighters.. 😄 Ssee you next week 😉
That kitchen looks so nice guys y'all did a great job I don't think it's anything you guys don't know how to do🍷🍷
i just love you guys, you are both amazing!
Hey guys, I want you to know that I so look forward to your Sunday video. I am especially delighted to see the progress of your dome.  So do you have electricity wired into the dome? I have lots of questions but I think they will get answered the closer you get to finishing it. Stay warm and be safe. 😘
Hi Tyler and Todd. Kitchen looks really good. You guys are amazing. I love your videos. I watch them all.
Love you amazing projects.
Love it! 💙
You guys are my new favorite couple on the internet I came across you a little bit ago after first video I was subscribed and looking for old videos to catch up you guys are awesome and everything looks beautiful and yes don't forget during the chaos  to remember each other and communicate so glad you had date night it's so easy to forget the little things 😊
Only 1 snack Bin ?! Is that enuf ??
Always  thought that shot in the  Rubbermaid  tote  would  come in handy for  the cover of your How-To  book!
OMG,, there truly is nothing you guys can't do!! That is amazing!! Beautiful 💖💖, Tyler and Todd,you are the best,, and make my Sunday so complete!! Love you both
Unbelievably cool cool 😎
It looks great. But where is your stove to cook. or is that what the black box on the counter next to the refrigerator is?
It's looking great  really like the fridge
Time for a harness & leash for your cat on walks.
Great Vlog!- I never get tired of the "I feel cheap" scene...... makes me laugh out loud every time.
Just can’t put into words how much I love you guys and your amazing little family.  Thank you for sharing your world with us.  ❤️
Hey guys I don’t know if you ever watched escape to the château on season four episode three she decorates a dorm like yours it might help you a little bit with some tips I’m not sure hopefully you get something out of it good luck
I once lived in a home with electric baseboard heat. The floors were freezing cold in the winter. That said, I'm curious whether or not your floors are warm. Congratulations on the kitchen! Lily seems to love it as well!
Phenomenal job as always. ❤️❤️❤️
greetings from belgium
Both of you are bringing it all together awesome job guys ❤️❤️❤️
Really beautiful you guys, so dang 👍 Much love from San Francisco, California
Love the dome, kitchen and of course you guys❤️ But I do have one question…where is the bathroom in dome?🤪
Todd's face when Tyler says "...there are multiple holes it can go in..." I love that look, and you can clearly see him trying to stop himself from blurting out the first dirty response that comes to mind. 🤣
I am so stoked about your new place🌹💕 You bring alot of happiness to me and I'm positive others think and feel the same way. 🥳💋🥰💖
Everything looks gorgeous ! Great job as always
Always get disappointed when the video ends. Love the kitchen!
There is nothing better than brand new full size appliances.  Okay there may be a few things better but a new kitchen is in the top five.    Nothing about Ikea furniture is intuitive or easy.  You aren’t the fist to make multiple trips back in to the Big Blue Castle.
"I feel cheap" it's my favourete prhare of this channel... sorry I'm not native and I'm Drunk. :)
Seeing the little teaser scene of the solar panels, I got so excited for your guys. You're gonna be making your own power!!  Your kitchen is great. I love how you're designing everything around that view.  I watched a video of another dome identical to yours and they had this block in the middle of the space for the kitchen and bath and it completely obscured the scenic view from the entrance.
How about the stove?
Hello Tyler,Hello Todd,l am a new subscriber,found you last week,l have been binge watching your videos and just loving them.The home your building is incredible,congratulations on following your dream,👏👏👏👏👏👏🌺
OMG that kitchen!!! AWESOME
It looks so good guys. Good job.
You guys are amazing with decorating!!!! Great job!! Looks terrific!!
Wow the kitchen turned out awesome.  Lilly loves it 💕. Now time it enjoy your hard work . Hugs
let me know when the village opens... I would love to come visit!...
Kitchen looks awesome! But I'm all about the cartwheel competition!  🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️..... let the games begin!  Love you guys! ❤❤
Started watching your channel a couple months ago. Now I'm hooked! So thrilled I found you guys. Love love love the kitchen build! You did an amazing job. Will you eventually put in a stove? So happy for you both. Great job!
Love that fridge!
Hey ..saying MULTIPLE HOLES nearby Todd …you were sure he would laugh lol love u guys
O M G. Lilly!!  Love your days!! 😁.  Literally had the exact same IKEA kitchen problem a few hours ago with the cabinets!!   Also 2 gays… putting together (well we said scr**ing) cabinets. 🤣
Awesome it must to have home again because you both have the freedom to move around & everything is coming together slowly but it will be all worth when it finally finished.
Glad you got kitty out of the tree. I once had a cat sit in a tree for days, and he ended up freezing his tail off, literally. Lilly is adorable! Watch out! she is taking over your kitchen area and soon will be in your pots & pans & plates! <G>
The kitchen is just stunning guys. ❤️
Aww! I love that two-level pet feeding stand!
The solar array! Omg can’t wait good job with the kitchen area!
Love the fridge...wanted to see the inside! Y'all are doing a great job on the dome!
A luxurious Ikea dinner date never looked so good!
Looks fantastic !!! ..... but no one could be surprised. Can’t wait to see the LR & sleeping area ... inside bathroom(?).  The view is SO gorgeous - glad you decided to keep it all open with no build in the center.   Lilli is adorable & her personality fits right into  your family culture
It's looking AMAZING!!! Will there be a stove?
Wow the finished kitchen,  just awesome!
Your home is soooo beautiful and you both should be very proud of yourselves for all your hard work and sharing it with us. Bless you and your fur babies in your dome home xox
I love the kitchen guys. But, what about a stove and oven? By the way,  I’ll  never get tired of the shower tub clip. 🤣 Love and be safe!🤗😘🌼🇻🇪
One word... airy.... no one word doesn’t do justice fantabulous
Where does the water go when the ice on the inside of the window melts? Does it cause any problems?
Love you guys……. You have done a great job but you are real about the struggles that come with projects.
Great job!!!!  Beautiful
I am amazed!  What you are showing us looks like a perfectly functional kitchen, with an optimum use of the space you have; also looks so easy to clean and to keep clean!  I applaud your ability to be creative with your IKEA furniture.  Love the spice drawer; and wouldn't turn down a wee dram from either bottle you have on the drinks counter!
Every Sunday night (around midnight where I live) you guys show up to have a perfect ending to the week and a great start for Monday! ❤️❤️❤️ Can't wait to see the solar panels project ;)
And that fridge adore it
Great work in the kitchen!  You may have answered this in a previous video, but was wondering how the temperature is in the dome….I saw the circular windows with the ice and thought I hope it’s not too cold in there!
Y’all did crush this. Omg looks fab
Great job guys building your IKEA kitchen.  I am one of the architects responsible for the first IKEA in Montreal and was in charge of supervising the building of the interior spaces.  I built IKEA kitchens in all our houses and just loved their modular kitchens.  Watching you brought it all back and I remember also missing parts or making some mistakes before getting the hang of it and building them in century old houses brings other issues such as slanted floors and walls.....IKEA was definitely my favourite project of all the buildings we designed. We have a lot to learn from the Swedes.  Did you get your fridge from IKEA also?  Love it and the sink and faucet also.  I think Lili likes it also...ahah!You guys are designers! It was hysterical to see all your furry kids eating in the same space.  We could not do that with our furry scotties and Westies at all.  We had to separate them or else one of them would go for the others food...ahah!   So happy for you to have a nice interior space to live in now.  You really deserve it and all the work is worthed in the end right? Have a great evening Tyler and Todd.  Love you guys!
The Fridge is absolutely beautiful! Much love to you guys from Miami!
I’m curious about how you run electrical outlets?
Well done guys the kitchen looks great you have good taste x
A M A Z I N G !!!!!! You guys are absolutely incredible!!!! You home is absolutely beautiful and cozy!!!
Personally I always get into a pickle when assembling IKEA stuff, but like you say follow the instructions metricrously or you're in trouble.  For you two it's a piece of cake !
Please make some good air fryer food soon, I am interested in getting one of those for my van.
A better solution would buy stuff from IKEA There stuff is not always the greatest but you did a good job with the 2x4's. Kitchen looks good.
Oh Todd…what would we do with out you and your looks.
The place looks so good you two you are doing an amazing job, so proud!! Alo that is my baby's Lily's sink now lol.
Tyler, take that hat off! We want to see that handsome head and beautiful hair!!!🍁🍁🇨🇦
I recently found your channel and you guys are amazing and so much fun, your home is beautiful...love your black cat
You might want to put some piece behind the kitchen counter so food doesn't fall behind there.
What are your plans for a litter box, would you need to vent it out? I'm interested! :) cutie Ms. Lily
I love watching your videos... you both are very creative and hard working
I am a temperature nerd. Tell us about the temps in there, is the stove heating it well?
Love it!
You might consider a larger rug under the table. As it is now, when you slide the chairs out to sit, the back legs of the chair will be off the rug. Could be wobbly and scratchy on the floor. The place looks great!
4:34  Multiple holes comment???  Had to pause again, because I was ROFL.... I think I love you guys!
The kitchen is amazing 👏.
I am so sorry for all the comments i just love yoou two and can not seem to shut up, lol. Did you buy that counter top from ikea and still have to cut out the sink area from it? Farm house sinks are the best, love it. ALSO OMG I LOVE YOUR FRIDGE SOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!
That’s what she said
I never realised Gym+Coffee was an Irish brand - and I'm Irish!
Todd is always saying stuff to throw Tyler off and he gets so embarrassed!!!!  lol
You so need to complain to them about the cheap ass legs!!!!!!!! This is the problem with Ikea they have good stuff but then put crappy legs on it lol. there should have been a selection of legs to choice from. some better than those at least.
Looks great guys, coming together nicely.  But, a thought just occurred to me...What happens when summer comes and it's 90 Degrees outside?  You got a plan for AC?  Could get pretty warm in that teepee...
Do ya'll share underwear or socks too??? How about toothbrush? NEED TO KNOW ASAP!
I'm 4 minutes, 14 seconds into this video, and already in hysterics... because you have already summed up the entire world's beliefs about IKEA... 1 minor mistake in the procedure of putting together your Glaarflegnugen Kabbitnetten will cost you hours and hours and hours of your life....
Lilly is STEALING THE SHOW! She is so Adorable and a great addition to your diverse family.  The kitchen is great! Everything is coming together 💞💞💞💞💞
Congratulations guys, that is a wonderful looking space.  You are amazing!  Just in case nobody told you that today, yes you are!!!
Hey guys! I’m in NB and we are in a lock down and my husband and I have been loving watching your old videos to keep us entertained and motivated. We are going to Halifax in a few a weeks. Wondering if you can share the name of the restaurant you ate at after Ikea. It looks amazing!
I am SO proud of you guys, your kitchen is GORGEOUS! Have you had any stormy weather/high winds while living in the dome, and did you notice any movement of the dome? I can't imagine how amazing it would be to sleep in something like this, hearing the wind howling outside. Love it!
You two are absolutely adorable! Awesome job on the kitchen!
No, too short video!! Seriously, I’m in love with your kitchen . Is it really that warm in there? You look like summer
All I can say is Not Enough…… I do look forward to your videos!!! Wish they were longer. You are Amazing!
Congrats on the kitchen. I am so happy for the both of you. Now on to the solar array? Way to go. See you next Sunday. Peace
We lived in our garage for a year. There was inflow plumbing and hot water but the sink drained to a bucket. Worked fine, just don't forget to empty frequently. :) Looks great guys.
Amazing kitchen great job guys.
Where is the hot firefighters when you need them so true and 🤣
Looks like Lilly adopted the sink as her own personal space and it could be a fight getting it back.🌈❤🧡💛💚💙💜🌈
Bravo guys!!
Lily might change her mind about that sink once you get running water.
Sorry boys but cats on the table yuck. Or should I say cat yuck.
This video was So Good. Hahaha, Lilly is like see Dads I can climb a tree and you have to come get me lol. Bahaha Todd's face when the word holes is said, then Tyler hops on by saying Top side and bottom side lol. Thanks for the laughs you guys, hope you have a great week.
Adore the frig. What is the brand?
do I need a driver and a drill? am way behind you.....but gotta start somewhere. Home sweet Dome
Funny thing is that Lily might have came down on her own if you walked away lol, not sure.
Great video! I got a picture of my dog Chase sitting on my bed watching you guys putting together your kitchen❤
Oh no LILY WTH LOL
Wow guys you really excelled this week the kitchen looks incredible and everything is really coming together so well. Glad you were able to fit a date night in as well, you really deserve it.  So now you started installing the solar panels, you guys really don't stop. total respect... great to see that things are really falling into place and you can start to see the results from your hard work. well done hope you have a good week. 😘😘 love to you and the fur babies Robb Torremolinos Spain
Ok LOVE that brown hoodie you are wearing and love that brand name as well.
You guys need some cat advice, you don't train them they train you.  Also if they can get up the tree they can get down.  They love sitting in sinks get used to it.
It's looking absolutely stunning ❤
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh your not eating at Ikea i see, they do not serve that stuff.
Growing up with cats, if they got there themselves, they can get back fine. 😅
So good to see you this evening - I needed your company today thanks guys.  The kitchen and the entire space is looking amazing - I cannot wait to see it all fall into place finally - My dream go  to place.  Have a great and successful week.
Your lucky you went back to Ikea to get those silverware holders that are only made to fit their drawers perfectly. lol. So hard to find them anywhere else.
Ha!  I love that Lilly is claiming AAALLL the new spaces!  It looks great, y'all!  Can't wait to see what's next!
I hope your guests will mind the edges of your new lovely sink.. this design of the sink meeting the board I see so much in modern designs of kitchens now days.. and it looks good, things get framed and different materials harmonies so well for your eyes.. but practical it is not. When water will spill out on the bench (i say when, not if), it has to be soaked up by something and someone or it will eventually cause water damage to the wood.. but that is beauty for you, hard work and pain.. many such sinks are not designed for being lowered into a board so that the top of the bench will level with the frame of the sink so water easily can be brought back into the sink when it spills over.. but that is life.. one have to live with the choices one made until one change again.. Thank you for all your efforts to document you achievements! I'm always curious to see what you have been up to every week.. and hope this way of life don't come with a to high cost for you.. I do not mean financially.. Cheers
What make is the fridge?
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww I hate Ikea's food NO NO NO NO NO NO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!
◡̈⋆ʜᴇʟʟᴏ(●’◡’●)ﾉ◡̈⋆ʜᴇʟʟᴏ(●’◡’●)ﾉ Husbands 🖐🌞🥰
I am so happy for you. You’ve worked SO hard to get to this point.  And it looks absolutely gorgeous.  Give yourselves a big pat on the back for a job well done!  🙌 ❤️
The Dome home is looking great Can’t wait to see it finished and then your next project should be fun to watch two beautiful men in the woods.
Plz IKEA sponsor us… ha, next min “bloody IKEA crap”  Haha. Loooove the fridge!!
Great job guys … I know it’s done and everyone has to have a say 🤦🏽‍♀️ I found over the years that of the kitchen benches are higher than recommended it’s so much easier to work for taller people and no back ache 💖💖
Hi I’m new to your channel the kitchen looks great 👍🏻
The dogs be like, Oh man, they’re moving stuff around again! 😂 And Lily is loving it.
Cats love high places.  Do u guys use cat tower?
We’ll drink a drink a drink to Lily the sink the sink the sink. Todd being upstaged by Lily was hilarious 😂 The dome is really taking shape now. Feels really homely ❤️ Are you going to have an oven and hob for cooking? Very excited for the solar farm ☀️
“I feel cheap” clip will live in forever like “so good” 😂 dome looks great 👍
Wow, so much progress...congrats Lilly, you are working your tail off
You guys are too cute. I can't wait to see your finished home.
Absolutely fabulous ‼️🌹🌹🌹💯
$10 each if you can go a whole day without saying "so good" or "so nice!" LOL.. also, if you're ever looking for slave labor, I could take a break from sweaty Nicaragua for awhile. That would be SO NICE!
I love you guys 🥰 I love all your videos and the love you have for each other is awesome ❤️
It is "so nice" boys. Another great achievement! ❤️🇬🇧
It’s Sunday🤩👍🤩❣️ The kitchen, your fridge, the table; the whole dang thing is INCREDIBLE!! We’re so happy that you showed us all the bits, what fun🤗!  We really love the bits process as well as the details of the big projects.We’re noticing the cool little “plant” is making its way around the dome, warming things up wherever it’s set. It has a life of purpose 🤗; It’s really a very cute touch. Just about the time we were wondering about counter space, you showed us the bar-just brilliant! When Ray and I were VERY young (like 22 and 23),we saved our money and bought an old school bus, gutted it, and created our little house on wheels. We had our 2 girls, who were 1 and 2 1/2. NOTHING EVER went as planned😖. We built log homes together up in Wyoming for 3 years, then built custom homes for 5 more. I remember when we moved out of the bus and into our first little house; It felt like a palace! Just sayin that we can relate! Can’t wait until next Sunday!!  You! Bless! Us!
Totally loving this dome! 👍😎🇨🇦📷🌲🐾🐾🐾💜🌎
I like the new intro though, love you guys 🙃😇🥰
Wow..everything is so pretty...your very hard work is so amazing 👏..love your positive thoughts ❤
OMG I JUST KNOW YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD PUT TOGETHER anything FROM ikea WITH EASE? I used to work there and NOTHING they make is easy to put together at all!!!!!!!!!!!! I do not buy their stuff unless someone else is doing the assembly lol.
Am new to your channel guys and i love it! I am still catching on your old videos. Love from the UK and all the best.
Bahaha...Multiple holes got me too!! But I'm not sure it deserved a bonk on the head?.... Think I better watch the whole thing before commenting.
Another awesome video!! Thank you!!
Will you be putting in a cooktop and oven?  If yes, where will it go?
kitchen looks absolutely amazing!
Yay, I was hoping for the "I feel cheap" clip.
Oh that Lily, such a charmer! The kitchen looks great.
it is soooo  nice! and Lily.. so CUTE!
This is only my 2nd time posting on YouTube in my entire life.  But had to get on here to say you guys are adorably awsome!  I've been following you for a minute.  When I saw that you were putting together your kitchen, I was like,  phew it should be a breeze for them, I'm mean really, you put together an entire house.  I Love it!  P.S. Lilly definitely stole that scene.
That kitchen is gorgeous. I love higher islands like that because they can double as different things: a bar when guests come over, a place for a casual meal, a prep space, a race track for Lilly..........
I love your new cozy Home and decoration. So nice!
Congratulations on your kitchen! It looks great. So happy for you both.
Y’all are so incredible! You know that right? Love the farm sink & retro fridge! Every week is a wonderful surprise from you two, thank you! Love your love! ✌️🐶🪵🌲🇨🇦
The kitchen looks amazing. You guys should be so proud of what  you both have accomplished. A beautiful place to call: Home⭐
I’m amazed at how big the dome is. I’m sure it’s larger than some apartments in large cities. Love the kitchen! The decorations are fabulous. If my husband opened an IKEA box he would look at the directions…throw them up in the air…and give up…😳🙄🤪 (He comes from a line of carpenters!) Then it would be up to my son and I to put it together. 😂😂😂 I absolutely love the table and chairs especially since you can stow them under the table to have more floor space. Brilliant! Good job guys!
Todd's dirty mind is written ALL over this face. ROFL  You look so relaxed and happy in your new space! I know the RV served its purpose and you made it work, but the dome is so much nicer.
No stove stop?
You  guy's have done a tremendous project besides having  bad times but always come back and get the job done, I raise my hat to you, God Bless..
Beautifully done guy’s, but I am not surprised because anything you guys are set out to do comes out amazing. I am so proud of you guys. You guys are so smart and Blessed. Everything is looking Great. Love you guy’s, stay safe and careful. God Bless love’s 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💕💕💕👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
Very nice kitchen, its all coming together , thanks for sharing .
Where's the bathroom?   I kept thinking something's missing?   Then I put my finger on it! It's the bathroom!      . ?   I love the Island!   And the rest of the kitchen!    You need a dish washer though!
So nice. I always wanted a farmhouse sink too dang it. #goals
I can't believe how much storage you guys have. The cat in the sink is hilarious.
Guys I love your videos hugs of light and love.❤️❤️🐶🐱🐶
Looking so good (nice!!!).  Are you installing a full size cooker as well?  I love the way Miss Lily supervises everything.   She is a sweet girl.  My young cat hangs out in the sink in my laundry too.  She loves to drink from the tap when I turn it on and gets very excited when I empty the water out of the dryer reservoir haha.  If I'm folding the laundry she hangs out in the sink in between cuddles.
Congratulations your house is beautiful ❤️
New year new boys? Nah we love yas just the you’s be.
Hi you two can doa ything you turn your hands and hearts to. You just great, keep on doing what your doing and don’t forget each other and the love you share x
The dome is looking fantastic  Love the new kitchen  Andrew 💐💜xx
Lilly.  I am glad you two were together rescuing her.  I had to solo rescue Betty my tortie.  Not sure how I got down from that tree with both of us alive, but 12 yrs later, here we are.  Love the kitchen and the fridge is very cool.  Stay well guys.  Keep livin and lovin your way.
so exciting ....AND a cliffhanger for next Sunday ! You guys are so great !
You can show “that clip” in every video! It never fails to make me laugh. Related Question: how do you shower in the winter??
Wow guys, Tampa here. Kitchen is really cool.  Great job.  The only addition I would suggest later is to create a "Backsplash" to prevent any mess from getting on the white dome material.  Not saying you guys are messy, but maybe Lilly might be, if you can keep her out of the sink. It is really looking wonderful, and you have done a great job on your new home.  Two years in the making and its worth it.  IKEA has some neat pieces and the kitchen combo with the floating bar is cool. ENJOY !
That kitchen is freakin’ gorgeous!
The video of the kids eating together was just too great for words!!!  What a fantastic setup you guys are creating!!!  So glad you decided to forego the cube approach: much much better for the view and of course, the boys won't lose their traditional sleeping spots.  I have to say the clip of the plastic bathtub always gets me laughing.  Thanks for the brilliant start to the week!!
Your kitchen is beautiful - well done!  But I wonder if you'll need a backsplash?  I have visions of Lilly clearing the counter off the back....
Love your new kitchen!!
We have the same mugs! 😉
Try to tell this Ikea story as short as can. Built my kitchen cabinets in my parents garage. W my Dads pick up got them to my house 1 mile away. Ok well the tall pantry cabinet my Dad said nooooo it does not needed tied down . First corner we turned it became mulitple pieces on the ground. So back to Ikea I went. Rebuilt one in my house. Then when I got to assembling the drawers I was doing it in my living room. They were sooo easy I kept saying. I said a moron could do this. When I went to put the drawers in I found I had put parts upside down or top on bottom and bottom on top. Whatever. My teenage son looked at me and seriously said so Mom does that make you lower then a moron. I literally rolled on the floor laughing. He then remade the drawers. Kitchen turned out beautiful though🙂
Well done guys but where’s the cooker/oven?
I just love watching not of you.  Humor and Love!!!❤❤
Great blog!! But I miss something. Are cooking on the wood stove or you using something else? Just curious. Still Love your Channel!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is the sink plumbed?
The unintended inside jokes are idiot pouf; you two are funny.  That is way cool that your fur family eat meals together! Nice set up like the fridge.
Okay, Lili the sink is NOT a litterbox.
Super cute
The kitchen is so AWESOME.  and love the little island table. Good job 👏  👏
Kitchen looks fab! So excited that its just all coming together. You've worked soooo hard on this and now you can sit back, look around, and know that you touched every element. Proud moments.
IKEA furniture assembly is a room in hell.
I love the refrigerator.
Lindos maravilhosos parabéns sou fã felicidade sempre sempre ❤❤❤❤❤
I know exactly what the big deal is about the fridge. I love cooking and need a lot of space in my fridge for condiments, sauces, and meal prep. And you know how much room veg takes in a fridge. I’ve been fighting with ideas for fridge and freezer for my van build. You have the property to even build a below ground cellar to store food stuffs and your canning. Lilly is so funny. She’s lucky to have two dads who will drop everything to come to her rescue. FYI…black cats love white sinks. I often find my boy Satchmo asleep in my bathroom shell shaped sink. I’m forever pulling his toys out of it too. It seems the ovular shape is great for chasing his balls around in. I truly believe that if a couple divorces it’s over the building of IKEA furniture. Kitchen looks perfect for the space and I love the fridge. Now you need a cooktop. Can’t wait for the solar install next week. Your vlogs definitely need to be longer. Love and cheers from Vancouver eh!
Wow!! What great design and style. Congrats! 🥳💜🐾🐾🐾
Lily is so cute in the sink. 🥰
Did you fornicate while you were at it.LOL.
Every time I love more and more this channel, very adorable couple 😘
Omg is there anything that these guys can’t do 👏👏👏👏👌🇬🇧
You can’t use the words IKEA furniture and idiot proof in the same sentence.. 💀
What an amazing home you've created for yourselves and your animals.  You've given that large space a cozy feeling and you winter should be a much better experience than 2021's.  My Sunday is now made.
You two guys are the best I don't know where you find all the energy
Check Eamon and Bec. They had a sad time with these cabnets.
You the best good luck!
My favorite day of the week...you can see the love you have for each other...the kitchen is the bomb,great job.
Took a break from my micro homework to watch your guys video!!! What a great kitchen. Me and my guy who’s name happens to be Tyler. We have dates at Ikea. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Good job on the kitchen I love it
So exciting !!!!   Kitchen looks great , although I have some small criticisms. I could wait until later cause I know its not finished but no time like the present.  I would move the animals feeding area and put the tall fridge next to the tall storage/drygoods area . It would look better visually I think and free up wasted space for a few more cabinets that you will always be able to use for storage even if you don't think you need them now. Also you would have more countertop space for cooking. You also need a much larger area rug, either round or rectangular under the dining area. I don't mean to be so critical but I used to work in interior design before retirement and it's hard not to point things out. I know you boys do things well design wise cause Ive seen your two RV spaces and your rentals that you have re-designed, so forgive me if I'm getting ahead of things you already know . Things are coming along !!!  So exciting !!!!   Overall looks great !! Love love that you are able to now have green plants which Im sure you were missing but just didnt have space for in the past !!!!      xox   HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!
You Guys are the best thing ng on TV. Bravo for the Ingenious way that you rescued Lily.  You are you own hot firemen!   Your home is just beautiful and the kitchen in a winner.  You may have to get second sink for Lilly.😊
All looks beautiful.  Each update is making your new space look homely. Congrats.
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! My fave part of the new kitchen is the fridge.  It is such a beautiful place. So quiet & serene.  You did great!!! See you next Sunday! Have a great week!!! p.s. Lily in the sink.....ADORABLE!!!
Love your kitchen guys and that fridge is awesome!
Kitchen looks awesome! Love the evolution from dream to hard work to reality! Your fun while doing things together is so nice to see. You two guys are rockin’ it!
Would you guys mind sharing info about the island with stools?  I can't find it on the IKEA US website.  Thanks!!  It might be a great fit for my space .
Love the kitchen. I'm going to look at Ikea cabinets.  They look really good.Thanks Tyler and Todd:-)
It looks soooool good!
You guys are brave. I couldn’t imagine trying to assemble anything from IKEA.
You guys are not fooling anybody.  Without Eddie, Charlie and Lily supervising, none of this would have been done.  I'm going to refrain from commenting on how Todd's ears perked up at the idea of "multiple holes."  Oh wait.....
ok - many times when you 2 were talking, I thought, "would someone please turn off that car alarm?" - I thought it was outside my house somewhere. But, after pausing / unpausing and removing headphones, I realized it was the music playing under you. It was so quiet, that all I could hear was the keyboard (?) repeating over and over. LOL.
❤
Lyly looks exactly like my own cat and meows exactly the same when she’s desperate, so funny !  The work you’ve done really turned the dome into a home. Looking forward next achievements !
Idiot proof Ikea?  Ha!   Ask Eamon and Bec about Ikea cabinets.  😉
Try putting pepper on your countertop to prevent Lily from using it or try putting pepper in the sink. It will cause sneezing and eventually she’ll catch on not to use it….worked for my cat…
Omg, this is amazing. Your kitchen is gorgeous! I’m sure everyone here has had challenges with IKEA construction but I love the way you (and basically most of us) adapted to challenges in the process and we are all for “making it work”! Sometimes the setbacks push us to expanding our skills. I love how funny you are, and I love the counter tops - and I love Lily in the sink 😂! The flowers are beautiful and I find that they always make life better in a Canadian winter.  We are proud of your achievements!
Woww you guys made such a small space look super nice! Love it 👌🏻❤️
Looks amazing!
Yay. A kitchen and a full fridge.
It's funday with Tyler and Todd. Love you boys . Looking amazing 👏 ❤
Woah I just went looking for videos on geodesic domes and found this video posted an hour ago. Thats gotta be a sign for me to build one. Great info here.
Love love the kitchen! No surprise.  Your projects are always fantastic 😊
Watching all that the two of you have done so far and how you have made this dome into a beautiful living space, I am excited to see what happens when you actually start building your house.  Every finished project is a beautiful reason to celebrate you both.  Each Sunday is a fun day for me because I know I will get to see your latest segment and also the latest segment from Van Wives.  It is a great way to spend an hour or so of my day.  Thank you.
Wow you guys that kitchen is absolutely amazing I just love it you guys.Great video you all the pups and Lilly seem to really enjoy this fabulous home good job you guys!
I REALLY ENJOY WATCHING YOU BOTH WONDERFUL VIDEOS STAY WARM AND BLESS AND SAFE OUTTHERE YOU HAVE ADORABLE DOGS AND CAT
The second you said multiple holes my eyes FLEW to Todd’s face! I was not disappointed! 😂😂😂
It really looks nice. You two do amazing work.
Double Air fryer ❤️
Isn't fun to assemble furniture with a cat? And they always end up back in the box it came in.
You guys are amazing it really look stunning another word to describe the kitchen the whole setup is looking absolutely gorgeous  Can't wait until next sunday Lots of love Johann
hey guys love all your videos ! i bought the same kitchen and had the same issues with the legs and bought industrial casters as legs and it worked out well .. great job btw
Highlight of my week!
Dlsb precioso que les está quedando todo y bien bella su cocina me encantó de showww y la vista ni se diga los bendigo grandemente,un abrazo corazones ♥️ hermosos 👌💯👏🇵🇷👌😘
I MUST have that island with bar stools, did it come from ikea??   Beautiful job !!! 👏
Love your videos! Very impressed with your building skills and the knowledge you’ve acquired in order to make all of this happen. Looking forward to the next video!
Livin the dream! I'm so impressed! Btw... Maybe your RV water hose with a heater cord, and foam hose/pipe sleeves over them would give you temporary water for the sink? Maybe a 12v water pump from the rv if you need to run the hose above ground? I believe the heater cord is safe to run along the pump housing. I have used heater cord every winter in my full-time rv setup. Never had a problem. Well, as long as you keep the heater cord straight, and not coiled around the hose. Doing that will make the cord burn out in about a two month period, instead of it having a full life of 2-3 years.I don't know your plumbing setup, so I could be way off. Just an idea though.
The kitchen area looks fantastic. You arange things together so well. For a shape like the dome you have to think zones or areas not symmetrical. Love everything you've done so far.take care
I love what you have done there is plenty room,where is the cooker going to go?.
where is the electrical outlets?
You got a follower from Argentina! Congaratulations boys
Kitchen looks great guys! 😁
I so so need a nap.
It looks amazing! I love it ❤️
I like the dome, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who wonders why you didn't just build your other house right away.
I introduced my mum to your channel about 4 months ago... she just subscribed and had to "pour myself a wee glass of wine to watch my boys" 🥰😂 thank you for making my mums Sunday "boys" 💛
A star is born! Lilly is amazing!
Love lillies new bed
I seriously am in love with your whole family. I smile and giggle/laugh with you 😍🐾🌀🎼🕉
your dome is looking fabulous xxx
Lily, master photo bomber 🥰
Looks beautiful.  You have great taste. Not easy to decorate a space like that and make everything look like it's supposed to be there. Great job boys!
Feel excited for you
Your space looks beautiful!
OMG! Fab-U-Lous!
Another case of cant find the hole
Lily is great. That will always now be her sink, but on the bright side it'll force you to always make sure the dishes are done. My eldest cat does the same thing in the tub. Something about being able to just spin around those smooth curved edges does something for her kitty brain.
Such a great kitchen!! Can't wait til next Sunday! xoxo
The kitchen looks great! ❤️🎉 Lily's sink 😁 and I love that they all eat together.
Multiple holes to go in. You are both soooo funny. Inspirational. See you next Sunday.
🤣😂😅 I swear to God that is still my favorite clip of all times out of every YouTuber I have ever watched that is my favorite clip#I feel cheap hahaha 😅😂🤣
Hope you two have been staying warm this last week or so.  It has been awfully chilly here in NS!   It was so funny to see “my” IKEA on a you tube show.   Looking forward to seeing the dome progress next week.
WOW, such hard workers! Looking beautiful :)))))))
So enjoy your weekly posts.  The Tupperware bath “i feel so cheap”  is my laugh of the week. Love you guys.
Great video!! What made Lilly run up tree??
Todd: “Where’s the hot firefighters when you need them?!” 😆🔥🐈‍⬛
Love you guys and your many planned projects.  Your dome is turning out so well, Wow!
Lillie aka squirrel is going to need a spinoff with her looking for those darn woodpeckers
Lilly up the tree outside, oh my.  Guess she's project minded like her parents and she had already tackled a Christmas tree, so..... glad she participated in the trip down.  I would have freaked if my Sable had done that.  Question : covering the small round windows remind me of doing the same thing in my motorhome for the roof vents,  but what about that "Huge" million dollar view window? Is that not a problem with cold air?  Hope not!
Being in your unique house---staged and  so well done looking  out at the snowy scenery is  drop dead gorgeous---Again Todd's quippy reference when putting the cabinets together is a riot---Lily has quite a personality to say the least-----Keep up the good work---Your house is absolutely GREAT----Love that Charlie and Eddie !!!
Love it!!!
It's one of the laws of physics that one single trip to Ikea is impossible; you *always* have to go back the next day for missing parts.  (And I'm in the UK. 😶)
These videos always end way too soon. 😩 ❤️
Loooooove to watch you guy's, so inspiring.😊
So good!
You guys deserve every ounce of happiness in this dome home. It's a beaut ! ❤
Every project you 2 do looks so good !
Did I miss something? Where's the stove ? Love the kitchen 😋
Date night at IKEA puts a whole new spin on cheap date!
Multiple holes don’t say it Todd just move on😂
👏👏👏Looks so cosy and homeley 👏👏👏🐈‍⬛😂she is so adorable and mischievous 😂🌨❄️👬🐕‍🦺🦮🐈‍⬛❄️🌨
Another amazing video.
beautiful! are you using an induction plate for cooking as well?
You guys have such beautiful energy ❤
The kitchen looks wonderful. I loved the preview of what’s to come next week. Love watching your videos!
Wow wow wow. Love the kitchen. So beautiful. What a great job. I want to move in too. Lol. And that is my fave clip of Todd in the tote bathing ... 😂😂😂
想问住在这里能点外卖吗？
The kitchen looks great, good job guys.
I laugh every time I see him bathing in that rubbermaid tub. Cracks me up!
The kitchen is so nice, but Todd's "I feel cheap" is a classic.
Why do you guys giggle when someone says "hole"? Wink* Wink*
For once I caught the video 1 minute after it was uploaded - yay! Downside is it means I have longer to wait for the next vlog😢😂😂. Tanks guys, those double entendres are not lost on anyone "there are multiple holes that it can go in"😜!
Re: clothes and gym. Y’all are working construction full time! Hanging around your house is a gym.
You guys are so clever and talented, you can put your mind to anything and yet you haven't worked out that Miss Lily was giving you the runaround and could get down that tree on her own 🤣....the dome is looking amazing, I love it.....see you next Sunday 🥰🐾🐾🐾
There is no end to the things you guys achieve. Great work boys. x P.S. Keep the cat happy or else.......
WOW!! Fantastic bois.
That shirt is a really great colour and fit!  Now we know where the phrase IKEA hacks came from! You have to make pieces to replace the crap stuff they sell you!
Love your home, but where is your stove?
Love you Guy’s
The progress is astounding! But we know how hard you both have worked to get this far. You SHOULD be very proud of all you have accomplished. I hope you know what an inspiration you are, on so many levels!!! Can't wait for next week, to see Tyler's dream come true!!!
Omg eating their food together 😍😊💗
I have a feeling that wine was involved when you were frustrated with “ multiple holes “ ! Lol
which one stretches the shirt
Hooray it's Sunday. Great to see you. Making lots of progress.  Is the log burner keeping you warm? Seems to be alot of space to heat. Stephen uk
Oh my goodness! I love how it’s completely coming together. I’m so happy for you all to see your dreams coming to life. Can’t wait till next week. Big Hugz 💯❤️💯❤️💯❤️
Boys!/! When did you last see a dead cat carcass in a tree????????????? The do come down on their own! Please get a grip.
you two are my inspiration! it's not just what you accomplished, but how you have done so with grace, dignity (even in the rubbermaid tub), humor, and, most importantly, deepening love. thank you for sharing. 💜
such a shame there is only 1 sunday a week
So cool guys!  Congrats…. And bravo for finding a feline approved chat noir spa‼️🏆🤣
I love the countertop, it's so beautiful and Lillie in the sink and on the tree, both made me laugh. Lillie was my highlight ;)
‘I feel cheap’ is my best clip ever! Makes me laugh every time. You two are so amusing!
Gorgeous countertop! 💜
I think the bathing in the tote was the reason I subscribed. I knew then I was going to love watching you too. Kitchen looks amazing
Hehe, “…multiple holes”. Thank you, I needed that laugh.
Where will the stove go in the kitchen
Looks great! Also love the view out your windows!
🐈 in 🌲 great rescue xoxo 😻😍😊💖
Um...., BEAUTIFUL!
wow didn't expect the kitchen would look like this Love it , you should post more than once a week
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 great job boys 👍👍🤗🥰😜
You two are such a joy to watch, thank you for sharing these parts of your lives with us 🥰
No “lots of screwing” joke? Missed opportunity!
Your date night food sure looked yummy.  So does your kitchen.
I hate to tell you but I  had the same problem when I purchased an Ikea desk/computer cupboard unit.  I had to make 3 trips back to get defective pieces replaced.  On the other hand, I purchased a bunkbed unit for my son's room and it went together without any issues.  And I love to eat lunch or dinner at Ikea.  Their Swedish meatball dish is quite good.
Kitchen looks fabulous.  Love that Lily found a new bed. 😂 Always look forward to Monday’s ( in Aus. )Tyler and Todd day. ❤️
Quit rubbing it in that you have a Costco nearby.  My closest one is 90 miles away….
I love your slimline refrigerator!  And the farmhouse sink, W O W!  I really am glad you share your videos I have learned so much! God bless you abundantly and stay safe and healthy!
Your kitchen looks amazing!!!  I can’t imagine how good it must feel to have a real kitchen again including a full size refrigerator and freezer.  Congrats!!
Multiple holes give you options. 😂😘
Love you guys, So smart to do what you do! Always awesome!
The solar panels are finally going in !!! What a milestone. Power to the land !!!! I feel so invested.
Everything looks amazing!  I’m so excited to see that solar field set up and functioning.  You all have a wonderful and productive week.
I love the life that you both have created together, I can only dream of what you guys have there. I can only imagine how great it is to live in nature with the one you love.  Nice job on the home you have built.
The cat always claims the sink! I’m old. And my whole life, if you are looking for the cat, check the sink, and tub! Maybe they are just minimalist at heart.lol good jobs boys! Looks fabulous
I loved the way Lily tucked herself in so perfectly in to the side of the sink 🤣. She looked so cute❣️
The dome is one of the most awedome thimgs I've seen on a property. You guys continue to amaze me each week.
IT looks great you guys! Congrats!   And Lilly is such a cat!!!   Adorable
Thank goodness it's Sunday = Tyler and Todd , kitchen looks fabulous so pleased for both of you. Lily up the tree hilarious. As always love from the UK x
Things in the dome are coming along very nicely.
I love the kitchen!  So cute!
So nice guys, what a beautiful build!!
My career for the past 15 years has been cabinets and countertops.......I shall not say anything about IKEA cabinets...it's all been said before......they are not worth the money you pay for them even more so now with the stock shortages! Ok I lied about not saying anything!
Yep this guys are great …and I  wish them the very best ….is so enjoyable to watch their adventures….blessings …
👬🐈🐕🐕👍❤️❤️
Beautiful! ❤️
I’m excited too 🥰🥰🥰
Why did he chuckle at “….. multiple holes 🕳 ……..” 🤔🤔🤔
So gorgeous!!!!! Great work
Stunning decor and ambience. I'm so happy for you both and the fur babies. Kudos guys for continuing the building of treasures. Hugs and love.
Looks great, cant wait till the next video
the thing about your channel is you give people inspiration by your skill and your efforts ... you both are deeply in love and your pet family is amazing .. always look forward to the next episode .. you're in my top ten of favorite shows  on the tube  :)   thanks guys for another fun episode
Love how everything is coming together. It is really looking like a home.your attitudes are the best.
Love the kitchen!
Seeing Todd sitting in the plastic bucket and taking a shower never fails to make me laugh! A Tyler & Todd classic! 😂 Good job with the kitchen, looks so nice! And I'm not surprised you've had issues with the legs. I know several people with these IKEA kitchen cabinets and none of them wasn't frustrated about those legs. Some were breaking, bending or didn't fit. Especially the sink aka Lily's new playground looks really nice!
💛💛💛
I absolutely adore you guys, your attitudes your life. 🥰 thanks for all the fun. Charlene😁
Hi from Edmonton 💕love the new kitchen 💕🐈🐕🐕💕
While waiting for you two, I looked back at some past videos . The most fun to watch  is when you two get testy with each other. But the best thing though is knowing at the end of your vidio you say" see you next Sunday". 80 lady
I see your big drapes and you demonstrated the Reflectix window covers, but what of the big skylight.  Not an issue in the middle of the Canadian winter, but that sun will be up all the time in the summer!  I might suggest a splash of white on your improvised cabinet blocking, it is visible from certain camera angles.
You guys.... If a cat can get UP a tree they can get DOWN a tree lol. Their claws work like loggers nail boots. If you'd have kept walking she would have climbed down and followed you. No rescuing cats from trees lol.
You guys are so delightful! Thank you for sharing your adventures - I'm really enjoying watching it all come together.
The kitchen looks great. You guys built a wonderful home.  Get Lilley her own cuddly soft cat/ dog basket/bed. Add a couple of soft cuddley cussions for her and she will luv it... she will curl up and feel snuggled.  My cat loves hers. I put it up away from my dogs. I love you guys.... keep  being so loving and tender with each other. ❤💙💚💛   👍 and  supermen when your doing your projects. 😄
Lily, the show stealer! Congrat.s to y'all for major completion!
The clip of Todd in the Rubbermaid tub never gets old😊 Also, I measure the same way as Tyler with incredible accuracy👍😂
That video was "so good", "so good".  And of course we need a bin by bin kitchen tour - the kitchen looks "so nice, so nice".  As always, a pure pleasure to watch you two and your amazeballs ability to do all of the things!
I absolutely love you guys You remind me of my son and his husband
It must be magical looking into the forest when it snows.  Love the look of your home.
All that round footage and you put in a dinky ass kitchen. To each his own. Nice job tho.
Wow guys, I am so impressed💖
Happy to see your dome becoming more and more homey.
I love it! Love everything about it. The fridge is awesome it looks like one of them old school icebox. So cool. And you definitely have Lily's approval. My cat is the same way she thinks she owns everything in this house LOL. And she does. Y'all have great taste! I enjoyed this video. See y'all next Sunday. take care
Yeah, panels👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I am loving the whole center that is so cute
The kitchen really came together great. Lily the little panther keeping you two on your toes. I love how the animals eat together, that is super sweet. Just wondering, what is the scenario for bathing in the dome ?
Beautiful space! My cat likes getting in the sink too. You can't break cats habits but if only you could then I would like mine to stop drinking tub water and attacking.
Love the kitchen! Especially Lily in the sink😍
We've had our IKEA kitchen for 13 years now. We assembled the boxes ourselves but our contractor working on other things offered to put it in as a free bonus, and we couldn't decline that. Nothing has broken in 13 years, and we still love it much today as we did when we put it in. Your kitchen looks awesome, and I'm excited to see the solar being put to work! Have a great week!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Your kitchen is awesome. I love the refrigerator!
Un petit bonjour depuis le sud de la France .....j'aime beaucoup votre installation sous le dôme; ce doit être une expérience tout a fait exceptionnelle, je vous envie .... et aussi un grand BRAVO pour toute vos réalisations... maintenant que vous êtes dans la partie déco, et suite à cette vidéo, je pense qu'une planche rappelant le bois du plan de travail et de l'ensemble table haute, serait bien sur le dessus du meuble étagère et pourquoi pas sur les cotés aussi .....Merci pour vos vidéos et vos explications ... bonne continuation et prenez bien soin de vous ...
Kitchen looks great!  It is motivating me to do an IKEA kitchenette in my basement!  Love watching you guys.
👍
ohhh! Cliff hanger! So good. Love the kitchen and kitten. Thanks for the video.
I really the "character development" of the domehome. So, so nice...
Well done guys 👍 you are both good to marry …lol almost unfair you are together and good at everything…congratulations..amazing Dome and space you got.👍💯
I've followed your vlog for many months!  You guys are amazing.  To keep your energy level at such a high level and still stay "in the moment" is amazing!  KUDOS!
Another wonderful video and completed project.  Well done. I am sure this will winter be so much better and mentally healthier that last year. Very glad to see you both upbeat and happy! ❤️
Good looking home.  Glad you both share.
Soooo...the dancing is awesome! Lol thanks guys!
It's gorgeous you guys WOW- Do you have water/sewer hookup for the dome? I've forgotten. I know you have water lines I saw that project, didn't I ? 🥰 Wow how exciting 😍😁
The problem with IKEA is that something is always not quite right when assembling .
You guys have said NOTHING about the sauna !!!!
You guys are adorable!  I'm new to your channel and I've only seen two videos but I love you both already!  So many couples should take advice from your union, you seem to really mesh well together, and I just love watching you work so well together and your home is so perfect!!  Great job!!  My husband and I are thinking of building off-grid with our Lil one who is only 7, but there's so much to think about first.  But you all make it look so easy!  Thank you for sharing!
Are you going to have a stove?
Just thinking, how about spraying foam on the inside walls, I realize this is no longer possible but someone with same set up could possibly benefit? I think you are wasting a lot of energy from those outside walls, plus this would provide some additional strength to the whole structure. Gorgeous layout for new kitchen!
Thank you for including us in your big adventure. I adore the witty replies to each when working on your projects. You can feel the love and see how much fun you're having.  Looking forward to the next video!
Love, love the counter top.
You guys amaze me every Sunday! I look forward to everything you come up with. It's like a fairy tale but obviously you have sacrificed and put a lot of hard work behind it. I'm so proud of you. 💞
All of this is so exciting to see. I just wonder if they will keep this Dome as it is, when they finish the final build on their permanent home. I say that tongue in cheek though, because I have a feeling they will have other things in mind by then.  I'm surprised you didn't get an island that has more storage in it, but can also be used as a breakfast area. I live alone and quite frankly, never sit at a table, so, I gave mine away.  It's going to be interesting to see what's done with this Dome in the Summer, with the Sun baking down on the Dome, and it's plastic type windows. How will this Dome be air conditioned. I'm guessing a floor model, but not sure how it will be vented.  These guys are so entertaining to watch, just love them.
Hello Boyz, the kitchen is absolutely fabulous! I love the sink, great build with the cupboards and drawers. Question Tyler & Todd what the heck is that refrigerator. Name, model please. I live in Canada as well . Also doing Reno’s, in the middle of a kitchen renovation. Any help to get that fridge that I 💕love  would be so helpful. Thanks for your inspirational videos. BTW we have 3 cats here, one senior The Godfather of the neighborhood, 16 years old and 2 kittiy brothers one black and one orange tabby.
wow! it's coming together so fast! It's looking amazing! What an amazing nest in your beautiful sanctuary of nature! <3 <3
Hi Tyler and Todd So have I missed a video somewhere in this build????🤔🤔 I am wondering where the video is showing us just how on earth you got your curtains up cos where did you anchor in the screws in the rail???? Love Love Loveeeeeeeee the progress so far in the home 😍😍😍😍 absolutely fantastic as always guys fabulous Lisa UK
Your home is absolutely beautiful ❤️❤️ I'm so proud of you guys!!!
Great work on the kitchen, it’s looking great. What a difference and you guys should be so proud. Love coming on the journey with you, seeing your efforts coming to fruition.Well done!
Just a thought,  I do not think you boys would regret adding some sort of backsplash to your cabinets.   You boys are so resourceful that whatever you add, things such as cupboards, wine rack or whatever, you came with, may give you more storage space.   Think of all the debris, kitchen tools, sharp objects, etc. that would not end up behind those cabinets.
My girl kitty climbed up a 60 ft oak tree her first time outside. She refused to come down, until her third day up the tree, I finally heard her plop on top of the dumpster. Since then she's been making life interesting, including needing surgery to remove her eye this fall. She's a 2 year old 6 1/2 lb tortie and her name is Harley. She rules over all five of the boy cats and has my dog wrapped around her little toe beans .
Tyler and Todd just a random question. Do you still own your AirB&B's?  I absolutely love your Dome home.  My Sunday is now complete with my boys. 🤩 My favorite type of sink as well. Reminds me of my Great Grandparents house.
The dome looks so great.
Great video again.  The dome does look like a home.  Really had a laugh about the hole (!) situation. Now Todd didn't even have to make a comment, just smile and Tyler you tried to keep your cool as a narrator.
So Good!!!!
The dome looks so good 😉 I love the refrigerator ❤️
You guys are the best!
CAUTION!!!!  CHANCE OF A BIG STORM next weekend.  Please keep a weather eye
LOL!  Love you guys!  The place is Fantastic.  Just beautiful really.  Thank you both for sharing your life with us.
You had me rolling on the floor laughing...several times. Love the progress you have made, the kitchen looks "so nice" -- sorry, I just had to do that. Now I have to wait for next Sunday to see what else you are up to. Thank you so much for letting us into your world.
Ok so you 2 make my Sundays! You both do a great job! Thanks for sharing!
I love the kitchen. Great work guys. You are amazing. May you have many happy days cooking your favorite meals .
Absolutely love the kitchen can't wait too see what's in store for next Sunday sending our love for you all
First time to reply for me, but l have watched from the beginning and love you both and the fur babies, congrats on everything you have accomplished so far and l love it all.  Can't wait for next Sunday❤ say safe!
The kitchen looks so nice, bright & functional. I have a question, where will the range live?
Love Lily’s adventurous spirit!  I’m sure she gives you hours of entertainment when she’s not giving you heart attacks. Vlog is entertaining as usual. Looking forward to next week vlog.
What is the life expectancy of any Ikia kitchen made of laminated pressboard ? 2 or 3 years ?
Ooh guys it has already been so nice and cosy. Congratulations 💖
After watching Eamon and Bec just tell us that Bec had cancer and being emotionally drained. I really needed me some Tyler & Todd.💕💕💕💕 PS . IKEA cabinets are a pain in the royal ass. I helped some friends put some together last year and that made us not want to go with IKEA.lol But you will completely be happy with the end product it really is a nice product those kitchen cabinets. Can’t wait to see the whole project finished! PS. Black stabilizing legs you were correct, complete shit. We ended up building legs ourselves like you all have done. And the one mistake that my friend made was the center island was tall and nice like it was supposed to be but the right side of the kitchen was about 2 inches shorter. It looks so ridiculous. Apparently, he didn’t see that he had made such a huge mistake until it was too late. Lol your place is coming together so beautifully. It’s really been fun watching this whole project. Thank you for sharing it with us💕
Sure looks fantastic,,, Great Job..  What software you using now for your video edting..??
good night beautiful family kisses 💋 from Portugal hope you have a wonderfull week see you next sunday guys can't wait to see what you are doing next. Be safe God bless kisses 💋❤️🙏.
Awesome, as usual you two
Back in the 70s I was one of those "hot firefighters" . I was fairly new on the job, and one day , assigned to Engine 2 , we were sent on a cat  in a tree call. Being the rookie, I was tasked with going up the ladder we had put up to get the cat. It's a good thing I had my turnout gear on because that cat dug it's claws into it instead of my shoulder when I grabbed it. I came down the ladder, picked the cat off my coat and set it on the ground.  That G.D. cat ran right back up the tree. We put the ladder back onto the rig, and left. It was the last cat in the tree call the department went on. I'm not a big fan of IKEA, but I do love that counter top. Way back in the 80s, when I thought I was straight, I got married ,and my brother gave us a cutting board much like that leftover piece of counter top. I still use it.
Soo gooood! To see you guys again! Nice kitchen, great job!
What a fun and funny video!  And yes, please keep and use that iconic clip.  Thanks for the chuckle. ❤️
WOW  -  you guys did good - it looks awesome - definitely using your RV experience in the kitchen
Kitset Ikea..... do not try this at home.....
How good is ikea!!  The kitchen has been closed where we are these days because of covid, but still, pretty great!  We always wanted a farmhouse sink too!  Looks great!
Great video guys!!
The kitchen looks amazing!
The two of you are so funny. "There are multiple holes it could fit it" LOL!!!!
Personally , I adore your round dining table and chairs by the window , i think thats grand .
Lily! What a lovely, spicy little girl!
Soooo Good :) , love it
You need a smaller satellite done master bedroom.  Then the main dome could be the great room.   Also a heated satellite indoor bathroom would be cool too.
So jealous, it looks stunning x
Love the new kitchen! Where are going to put a stove though? You guys amaze me at a the stuff you can build! I really hope you know how many people you are inspiring! I can't wait for Sundays because of your videos! Thank you!
Looks nice! Do you have a stovetop or do you always use the air fryer (which we hilariously call the hair dryer).
Well done guys!  Best wishes for more successful projects.....so impressed.
That counter top is so great, wow love it
I love how Lilly stole the show such a wonderful family. What a wonderful job you both are doing.
The kitchen looks so good! I have a cat that is just like Lily, and she was a little devil for about two years and then she turned into a very cuddly rug. Enjoy the phase and I swear it will be funny stories in a couple of years
Was it Ikea's restaurant??? :o clearly does not look the same over here, lucky you :)
So good!!!  Beautiful space!  And now, as I stand in my own kitchen that needs cleaning, I ask myself what would Tyler and Todd do?  Well, Tyler and Todd would probably move everthing out and rebuild but it's enough for me that I'm motivated by you two to start cleaning.  Thanks for another great episode and congrats on trending!  ❤❤
LOVE this gorgeous space! I do love watching folks in geodesic domes and now my favourite YouTube channel has one too! So proud of you both for all your efforts and the utter privilege of us being able to come along with you xxx
Everything is so very organized and looks very nice. Lilly is claiming the sink for sure!
The kitchen is amazing!!!! So happy to see the dome coming together so beautifully.  I have to say, I am crazy in love with Lilly. I'm a cat person and so glad you have her. Watching her eat with the dogs was so sweet! You guys crack me up sometimes. There are certain words that set you two off. I love it! Keep it coming, boys. You make my day.
OOOOOooooo you like Disaronno ! I LOVE that with coca cola and ice .
Wow 🤩 it’s very nice kitchen
Hi guys great video as always, where did you get your dining table from xx
LILLY stole the show, from tree saving to tail chasing in the farm sink.  How wonderful for both of you.  Congrats on the kitchen!!!
Another excellent video, I admire your enterprise. One question, where is your bathroom?  Thank you
Is this vlog on Jan. 23 2022 and no snow, I guess your sending Montreal all the snow and -32
Great video. If you want to keep Lilly out of the sink, place a sheet piece of aluminum foil in the sink. Cats don't like the way foil feels on their feet. Also, provide an alternative like a cat tree/house.
I was waiting for the multiple hole joke *grins at each other in a dirttyyy way *
It’s beautiful!!!
I am as excited as you are for you kitchen. It looks so good.  I always smile when you need to go to the store for something .  What is a project for you two if you don;t have to go to town at least once.  Good thing you have imaginations and are creative.  Lily in the sink is adorable. Can’t wait for the solar panels next week. You make my Sunday.
Nice video guys😍 my cat's name is Lilly too full name Lilly Roundtree
Well done you two! Beautiful and I love love love your fridge choice!
SOLAR!! Couldn't be more excited for you both. Also that kitchen looks amazing, anxious to see how you work out the plumbing. See you next Sunday <3
its not a Sunday without Tyler and Todd  can't wait the cooking Sunday  you two are so sweet  and ment foe each other,
You two are the best thing on YouTube right now 😁
Oh my God that kitchen you guys put in looks FANTASTIC 💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹💜💜🌹💜🌹💜
Where is the stove / oven .
Love the space! Where did you get the island/table and stools?
Awesome, love your videos...😁🤗👍🏻
When I was a kid we had a cat that would chase after dogs until one would run it up a tall pine tree.  It would usually take several days for her to finally come down from hunger.   That stopped after a tornado came through the neighborhood and blew her down.   No more running up trees.
Looking nice and cozy. Did you make a chopping board out of that piece of wood you cut out
It's looking great, see you next Sunday
You know something I have NEVER seen?  Absolutely Never!  A cat skeleton in a tree.
Omg, I love. This space.  I would never have thought you could make this dome look so awesome and luxurious.  Thanks for sharing!
My favorite part is that you think you can train a cat not to get into the sink.  I have to use a bungee cord on the faucet to keep my cats from turning on the water and playing in the sink. Great Kitchen space!!! See you next week.
I was worried that Todd got whiplash when he looked at the camera after hearing "there's  many holes to choose  from." 😂😂 And then I worried he would bite through his tongue in his attempt not to make a joke! 😂😂
Hahaha Todd has a dirty mind and it cracks me up! I’m going to enjoy watching your vlog! Have a great evening 😊
I love the sound of the howling wind at your intro 😏 I say you two are IKEA masters. Shorts  or boxers is it that warm in there?  She would get herself down.
My fav guys on Sunday! What a great way to enjoy my dinner then to watch Tyler, Todd, Charlie, Eddie and Lily, u did such a beautiful job of the kitchen and I can't wait to see more next Sunday, cheers x
Where do you go #2 and do you still use your outside shower in the winter?
WOW...the kitchen is awesome. You guys are SOO good at decorating and putting different elements together. Your 'dome home' is really shaping up nicely. Thanks for sharing! <3
love it all! I have a young cat like you have that we rescued from death literally. Anyways She is a climber as all cats are and at 5 months she is more and more getting on things. Your Lil one has way less room so that kitchen is going to be her playground for sure. Just Keep food off the counters and let her have at it. 😺😼😻
Do you have a link where you got the bar table with hanging stools?
I am so happy for you guys I have tears😊♥️
omg can't wait for the next one!!! ❤😘
The kitchen build looks beautiful! One idea to keep Lily out of the sink or off the counter is to put sheets of aluminum foil along the counter or in the sink.  Cats don’t like the feel or sound of aluminum foil.
Wow!! Your whole home looks amazing 😍x
Are you going to add a stove?
Wow the place looks amazing guys! Well done!
Great video! Same question as last week - where’s the bathroom?
Multiple holes skool funny love you two
Do you have a link to the dining table? I love it!
Oh WOW I LUV your Home. Y'all did such a GREAT job
The Dome is such a bright and open space,  I love it and I love your kitchen.  I want that fridge in my small apartment.  Life is never dull with you guys.  Thank you for sharing your life with us. Lilly is a constant source of entertainment   😜❤❤❤
Eamon and Bec had same ikea drawer issues!! :)
Oh those multiple holes are always such a dilemma 🤣🤣🤣
OMGGGG I just love Lilly playing in the sink so much ❤❤❤
Love the shout of to Ikea... first your selling them, then your slamming them on the feet for the cabinets - all in one video!! "It's crap" LOL Great job on the kitchen and that island just ties it all together. That fridge is my dream retro fridge. Too expensive (and small) for me & my family, but oh so beautiful. One day maybe... As for mischievous-Lily, with all the trees around, she's gonna have to figure it out for herself! LOL
I just love the clip of Todd, and it never fails to make me laugh. "Umm, I feel cheap!" LOL! I love watching you guys, and I'm excited for you both!
Looks Amazing!!!
Lilly in the sink = love! :)) absolutely adore your home, awesome work as always. You guys truly are an inspiration.. ♥
What big projects are next ?
Looking good. RubberMaid tote bath clip is still funny!
What a great episode- you guys are just moving right along! Excited for next Sunday. Have a good week🌞
Looking Good!  It's nice to have a home.
I am so excited to get in there and see what you two were up to. Always look forward to Sunday and seeing you too and those fabulous fur Babies of yours. Stay safe and healthy, Meg from upstate New York
Dare I say it?  This video was “so good!”  Things in the dome are coming along very nicely. I hope everything met with Lillie’s approval.  After seeing what you have done so far with the dome I am wondering what the house will be like once finished.  Sending lots of love to you all! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. See you Sunday!
Dome looks great and i love the drone shots. Any update on Charlies health, Lymes disease?
Beautiful 😻. I just love it. ✨🌈✨Wee question - will you have a cooker of sorts? 🥰
U bought the sink for ur fur kitty love watching y'all
Guys. What a great kitchen.  Where the stove?
Great job guys!  Love the kitchen!
But where are you going to put the pooper?
Surprisingly as it is, I saw two YouTubers... male couples... that had purchased the same identical Dome. Both of them put the fireplace in front of the large windows and a lot of sleeping deck inside the front door with the kitchen off to the left stairs in office to the right as you enter. One of them couples Wells from Canada and I think the other one was from Seattle. Oh yeah and everyone spray foam underneath. Y'all are just doing a marvelous job on your Dome!👏👍❤
You guys are so precious
i an so glad for you guys.
Black Cats are amazing...My Black Cat ran up my Oak tree, about 40 feet, took him awhile, but he climbed down safely ...Also, he loved the sink, i would turn the water on a little, and he would drink  from the faucet ...Love my Ralphie  😎👍
That ficus lyrata looks perfeeect , is it real or fake
Omg I'm steeling this idea 100% not the dome I dont...were leaning more towards small cabin...but that kitchen is the way to go!
looks awesome guys ......cheers
I can not tell you how much joy your videos give me. Puts a smile on my face every time.
Love watching you both, it's looking great, doing a brilliant job ,  Your vids make me smile,  Take care Rachel
must not be too cold in Canada -- you're wearing shorts.
LILY: If I fits I sits, top of tree, kitchen sink.....
It looks fantastic!  I love it.🤩
The place is really coming along. I love the white counters and the wood furniture. Looks great together. I can’t wait to see next week’s video. Lilly is such a lovely addition to the family. I love watching her crazy antics.
💯🔥💯👍🏾
Wow, love how the kitchen area has turned out!  Great work guys :)
Sigh another cliffhanger....see you guys next sunday
Where’s the wine rack?
Beautiful kitchen!!  Great job guys!
Damn you guys never stop but things are just so awesome guys!  I am so happy you finally got a kitchen. Have a great week and can’t wait to see the solar panels up! ❤️❤️
oh that vegan menu <3 <3 <3
Happy Tyler and Todd Sunday!
Lily is hilariously bad in this video
The legs are for leveling only. The blocks in the back corners of the base cabinets are there for screwing them to the studs in the wall (which you don't have lol) so they don't fall forward when you open the drawer.  Retired cabinet maker here.
Did I miss it, but where is your bathroom? Or where will it be? I know a lot of folks put all the plumbing in the center and you didn't want to obstruct your view. Just curious. It looks amazing and I always enjoy Sunday afternoons with you two!!
You guys have done a beautiful job...
Can you do a tour of the property? It is really pretty 😍
I'm so proud of your home guys!!! I love it
I just love you two! You are amazing! #sogood
You guys are so deliciously naughty.  Please never change.  I saw what you did there, and I am a 68 year old woman.  Just love you both!
I don't understand why you guys did not buy a Kitchen Queen wood cookstove.  You can cook with the same stove you're heating with.  In the summer most likely, you will be cooking outdoors.   FYI: Ikea is the worst offender of the environment.
You are in by 4:39 and already the "holes" gags are coming . you Todd are incorrigible!
Amazing guys, just amazing. And Lilly is just so adorable <3. Much love.
You are just such a damn cute couple! But that's not my question, which is this: are you not afraid of forest fires come summer?
So smart to get white cabinets and fridge. White makes spaces seem larger.
You guys always amaze me . You work hard and carry one another if needed.  I hope you always stay in love and respect each other .
Love it! Question tho, will you be able to pull the wrinkles? off the walls at some point?

I had the misfortune of working for ikea. They're abusive and told their workers they didn't care if they got Covid and died!
Warm greetings all the way from South Africa 🇿🇦
Guys, who do you go to to get your hair styled?, is there someone nearby that you always go to and depend on giving you the best service ?
I was putting together some IKEA cabinets one time and put a drawer together wrong. I had to google the fix. Never would have figured it out otherwise.
Todd really focuses  on everything he does!! You can see the determination in his eyes!! I love it!! 😂❤️💪🏽🙏🏽
I’ve been remodeling my geodesic dome too! Except mine isn’t round.  And it has 4 walls that are perpendicular. And a roof.   Well shed, I’m cleaning up my shed.   😅
Watching it all come together is SO COOL!! Happy Sunday fam🥰

Yay I'm early today!  I'm watching NFL football now but decided to check to see if you posted your Sunday video
Your vlogs make me so happy every week. Please, never change (unless you want to). Shalom from Jerusalem.
When we finished the kitchen we literally had zero words except “so nice” HAHA…forgive us for not being as descriptive as normal but we just don’t have the words. As you know, there’s been so much work to get to this point so to finally have this space where we can make a nice meal together is really just everything. Also, just wanted to say a quick thank you to each and every one of you who have shared our videos with your friends and family as well as on social media…because of you our last 2 videos we’re featured on the trending page, which is a really big deal especially for a channel like ours. This community means more to us than we could ever possibly say…let us know what you thought of the build, can’t wait for next week! 💛
Love this duo!
Yay! Sunday just got better! Thanks Tyler and Todd! 💙❄💙❄💙❄💙❄💙
Yay!!! ✨🌈✨
Yes!! So excited to watch :D Since I started watching you videos a keep researching where I can buy land to build a geodesic dome :D And then I remember I'm a broke college student - so that dream will have to wait. But one day! Until then I'm vicariously living it through your videos :D
