yea yea yea🥴🥴🥴🥴
This is how motorsports should be! All different types of racing on the same freaking weekend/place!
Hell Yeah Brother!
Your truck is slow !
Seems like Cleetus is the fastest and cleanest driver in the field but this weekend call me crazy but it seemed like they were trying to take him out.
Thats awsome...would love to see rhat..
KILLIN' IT!!  Oh yeah, look out for Max.  He'll dump and/or flip ya.
You should have a beer drinking contest before the race.  It would be amazing!!!
Hopefully they will let you drive a faster truck for your own event. They did you dirty on today's race. You are too much competition for the "pros" so they gave you a lemon and they were sour about you holding up the pack with your crazy mad skills.
Hell ya
Sucks you ended up in the wall causing a flat, you put on a great show.
THE AMMOUNT OF THINGS THIS MAN IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IS ASTRONOMICAL!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
When are you guys coming back to Houston Cleetus and cars
Cool , I think those stadium super trucks are awesome 💪👍 Good job Cletus !!
Ngl. It'd be cool to see non car YouTube channel hosts. Like Rhett and link or Sean from hot ones. You know they'd do it lol.
This is what a good network does for you. It’s not who you are, it’s who you know…
This man isn’t gonna have time for his family if he don’t calm down. CLEET ONCE MY BOY WAS BORN ALL MY STUFF STOPPED I just want to see him happy!! I’m not trying to overstep. if I was your brother I would tell you out of love so that’s what I’m doing
keep riding the wave living that dream brother just remember do it for dale
This man will go down in History.
should have the dale truck for a pace car or truck for bristol 1000
Soon to become a wheel man, fly him and he will drive it!
if I'm not mistaken "stadium" comes before "super"
CLEETUS!!!! Bro should definitely look into the merril ice racing up in Wisconsin on a frozen lake! Take the fleet and take on a new challenge!!! Slap some studded tires on and give er hell!!!
Cleet is gonna end up CEO of his on full feature race program and Nascar is gonna be pissed off.    we gonna have drag racing, drifting, stock car, trophy truck, jet boats hover crafts, air planes and choppers  racing in all kinds of places   he might even hold the first lunar race on the moon...
This is gonna be nuts!!
This guy is a legend.
Ask robby when his speed UTVs are gonna ship
Cleeter you and the crew are the biggest motorsport ambassador we have and i must thank EVERY body involved
So glad you are pursuing this! One of my favorite type of races to watch!!
Put me in coach
Cleet just wanted you to know. The baby 👶 my girlfriend and I just had  is alive and well thanks to going to your event the ranger danger last October. We almost named him cleetus . We ended up going with Travis. Good luck with your new one on the way as well.
I'm fired up! SST, and Cleetus McFarland were meant to be. <3
Isn’t it Stadium Super Trucks? Suppose you would know, but that’s what we called them down under
I want to see a criss cross in the middle of the track like they did at Glen Helen.
Fuck the PPV I'm tired of everything being a PPV just to make the rich richer. U even ruin one of my favorite drift events clutch kickers. Can watch pro for free and drift Masters pro so I would I have to pay to watch a lesser version of that. Payout comes from charging the drivers. Not even counting sponsorships and ticket sales.
That dude that let you use his car should be flown out to be in that race. small gesture of kindness from him and your chance to give him a life long memory
happy for you Cletus
What a legend, the poise, tact and love, that it takes to jump into the rings and coordinate with the big dogs of all avenues of motorsport does not go unnoticed
Your never gonna make it in any racing discipline racing in all. You have a full team we all love watching.  Share the race series out. Drifting n drag, cleet, oval n stadium jackstand. Slower drags n whatever buenos dias 😎 share the rest. You will do better as a channel and individually do better 😎👌
yeah okay, but where are the Tye videos?
That’s gonna be nuts. Congratulations on the growth and success everyone!
Come down to the river in Nashville and say "hi" to the volunteer crews on the safety boats. Not as cool as your jet boats, but they'll do the job.
good job!!!!!
You should book some bands to play
So awesome!!!
Epic stuff, man!!!!
YESSSS!!!!!!!! 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
The Cleetus team just keeps getting better and better!!! And I thought you guys were sitting in high cotton when you were renting that tiny shop to wrench on Leroy in. Incredible.
Add Cooper to the list! I’ll buy 25 people tickets if you do.
Garrett you need to purchase Thunder Valley Raceway in Noble, Oklahoma!!!
Hell yeah! Love the stadium trucks
All I got to say is "GOLLY!"
AHHHHHHH! I'VE BEEN SAYTING THIS FOR SO LONGGGG
Epic
Is it a rain or shine race?

Let’s go brother just more and more good news coming from the Cleetus crew I’m so happy for you guys and girls your totally killing it
I’d love to come and see an event. Is there any way you can come to circuit of America?
Holy, This man doesn’t miss! Killing it Cleet!
Freedom Factory is going to be the Disney Land for all motorsports. Drift, circle track, drag race, stadium trucks, truck pulls, jet boats, the list goes on. All in the same location!   Multi day events of where you just walk around to different events drinkin a Bartle skeet
Sounds like sept4 is going to be a good day, It’s also my birthday lol. Unfortunately I won’t be able to attend, I’ll be on a beach 1100 miles away.
Cleetus, if you’re going to be involved and promoting the SST racing, please get the name right. It is Stadium Super Trucks, Not Super Stadium Trucks.. it just makes it seem like you don’t know what you’re talking about. Maybe I’m nitpicking 🤷🏻‍♂️
This is going to be insanely cool
This is awesome 👌
Great content thanks for sharing
How many different motor sports can one guy dominate in? We're going to find out in the coming years.
The next Travis Pastrana
This Guy, goes from strength to strength. You've come a long way from those humble beginnings my American Brother.......Here for the Journey.....
Coming to Bristol? Lake view RV resort is an awesome place to stay. They have cabins also. It’s only 5 miles to the track. Don’t forget, the city of Bristol has the new Hard Rock casino in it’s temporary location now open.
You should invite freddy lsx jerrytweek statik leo and triple p
Now that is going to be shweet
Get it all out your system, life will change when the baby is arrive lol congratz
That’s a huuuuge HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
DRAG CARS, SPEED BOATS , DRIFTING , SXS, STADIUM TRUCKS, BURNOUT CARS, ?? HOW MUCH BETTER CAN IT GET ???
You sir are an absolute dynamo!!!  I don't know where you get the energy.
Dude your awesome 😎 keep up the great work.thanks for taking us along
Ofcourse they want you to race again not only did you come out and nearly win your first time ever doing it but I'm sure that's the most people they have ever had wathing the sport. I'm excited for you! Your the definition of a wheel man
Hell yeah stadium super trucks! Baller racing 100k a race! Hell yeah
The wife and I planned on going to the races in Nashville, now you’re going to be there….hell yea brother
Legendary brother!!!
Here me out.stadium sprint boat races
I've purchased at least 5 shirts and your asphalt deal in the past, but dang if I REFUSE to purchase ANYTHING from ol' CLEET until he shaves.  Gal'dangitman... I saw a finch in there.
Just be safe man...ya got a kid on the way.. keep it up man!
I think Cleetus is going to to single handedly take out NASCAR some day.  I think he is officially the best event organizer/ promoter in the industry.
Next car race you need to invite Chris Birdsong aka Junkerup he would crush it on the track
Man I wish I could afford to make any trip to one of you event but especially this one!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍
Oh damn
Good to see you alwaus expanding your driving abilities
That's gonna rock
Now all you need is Paul from Fab rats to make it a complete race
Cleetus make a fibreglass crown Vic body and stick it on a stadium truck, you can't lose🤣
I love you guys and what you do. Please go drag racing and knock down times on the cars
epic
Think this shows how hard drifting is only you can’t hop in anything and win 🥇
if only the way to come in bristol was as cheap as the ticket. dont know if i could afford the plain ticket either. would be cheaper if it was only one way. 😏     is that mexican border still open for people that want to get everything from the goverment but not want to or can't pay for it?
That’s it, I’m in!
I really hope it's a long time before we get news that you've been in a big crash
Figure of 8 with a jump in the middle to cross over would be good for the stadium trucks..
HELL YA BROTHER!!!!
This is awesome... I'd really like to see ol cleet run some dirt races with the HTF guys
Get this man in a trophy truck!! Please
Hell yeah brother!
SIIIIICK!!!
PUT THIS ON THE MAIN CHANNEL
Fire me up!
Hell yeah brother!
Great news! Super Stadium Trucks RULE!
Nice 1 on bringing the Goonzquad lads to the track for.the next race event
Holy crap, dude! This is awesome! You're absolutely killing it.
We need to have a staduim truck with a Crown Vic body on it.
Dang!  That’s a lot of live action!
The most important question, is who is going to be the first to launch a Crown Vic off the biggest jump?  George or Cleetus?
Do it for Dew Fab Rats @ Bristol
Hey Cleetus you need to get Robby and you both take some American Bald Eagles and go race DAKAR
Those trucks kick ass, ggz-👽👍🚲💥💨💨💨🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🏁
You have so much potential
hell yea brother!!!!!
Mama.... mama  ..... mama guess what.....? That Florida boy is f@*king jumping trucks now 😳...... we gota go to Bristol LFG .. mama Bobby's get the beer it's all on him
Stadium super trucks….why do you always say it backwards? 😂 looking forward to seeing it!
I love me some Bristol. Was a season ticket holder for many years. During that time my ass was first to sit in the new Earnhardt section. Good times indeed.
Wow that’s epic level!
Congrats that’s awesome that’s gonna be a heck of a show!!  Do it for Dale!!!
Not sure the trucks will be safe at Bristol not enouph flat for the jumpin - but it will be interesting
That is so sick!!
Support
cant wait to see you rip in nashville this weekend!!
Figure 8.....jump over?
That's gonna be awesome but please keep your cool and don't wipe out 50 meters from the finish line. I'm sure we all wanna see you win this one, cause you have definitely have the talent to win! Good luck and be safe!
Paul from fabRatz
Hell Yeah! So glad to see Cleetus running a Stadium Super Truck again! Keep up the great work man, you’re gonna put racing back on the map!
Bristol is shaping up to be epic
Are you going to try and get some seat time before the races?   It's been a few months.
I wish I lived closer than oregon!!
Go cleatus go
Got Damn that is Awesome news Brother.
SSIIIICK!!!
I go back and watch that race so often! That spin out at the finish line while leading the race was some action movie shizz!
Hell yeah!
Stadium truck racing is seriously fun to watch. Crossing my fingers that Garrett doesn't have another incident within hundreds of feet of winning. Freedom!
Oh man ... Why you gotta do this to us? This is just awesome!
Travis Pastrana of the youtube age!
SEND IT CLEETER!
Robby Gordon needs to race in the crown Vic’s!!!!
Hell yeah brother!!! Already got my tickets for the whole weekend!!
SST is my favorite driving sport to watch you race in! It's fast, crazy, and fun!
I knew I shoulda have bought tickets and flown out there
Hells-yes.
Oh man I am excited to see you race again
Outstanding
Mcfarland Fest is gonna be badass.  I really hope you do this annually.
Hell yea!!
Hey what’s up bro how are you
Congrats! Buenos Diassss!
Next up m. Racing those boats again hope to see you back up in WA I missed you last time but won’t let it happen again
Hell yeah! Stadium super trucks are AWESOME!!
Garrett,  your killing it. So happy for you all. Im a old dude, but its great seeing someone not only chase his dreams, but work his ass off to accomplish them. Super impressed 👏.  Not only that but a huge positive influence on our youth showing them that with hard work and determination you can make dreams a reality, and your not just going to have people hand stuff to you. Your parents did an amazing job instilling a strong moral fiber and great work ethic. God Bless.
THIS IS AWESOME!!! I was wondering what happened with the Stadium Truck stuff. Your premiere race was amazing and even though you finished last who even remembers who won that race after seeing you run across the finish line after wrecking your truck. lol
Hell Yeah Brother!!!!
Can’t Wait🇺🇸
will you post the truck races more often? like the one in Nashville?
Gonna need a super stadium crown Vic
"Stadium Super trucks ". Once agents Stadium  Super  Trucks  In that order!
didnt even know you were running in with SST Nashville race
Working overtime as always man! Living every man’s dream and we appreciate it!
Ooooooomg! The content verity never ends! Let's go!
F*ck yes
Man you need to have the Crown Vic race on Saturday for the one that can not come on Sunday.
Hell yeah going to have to check that out as long as there's no drifting there that is not a sport LOL
Hell Yeah Brother!!
That race you had in Long Beach with those trucks was incredible that has to been the hardest loss you've ever had right there at the end you should have won
PPV be there
Stadium truck track at the FF?????
Awesome!! Happy for you guys man. Definitely making a name in motor sports!!    Might as well get some motorbikes there jumping/racing.
So cool!! Your a badass driver in everything you sit in!!
Woooooooo! Go cleetus!!
Is there any way to watch the Nashville Super Stadium Truck Race if we cant make it to Nashville in person?
Hmmmmmmm.....10 hour drive from the middle of Michigan.....OK!  We'll be there!  We were on the edge and almost bought tickets a few weeks ago but STADIUM TRUCKS!!!  SOLD BROTHER!!!
Surprised there isn't more people registered om this channel lol I'm like sub 80-
Yessir!
Dang.  You should sponsor the no name nationals!
Mark my words, one day we will look back on videos like this and say 'Remember when Cleetus used to address his fans on a side channel on YouTube' I hope the fame doesn't change him, but where this guy is going I don't see how it can't. Either way, go get it man!
I'd go to one of these if Matt or Paul from Fab Rats was to get invited.
wow im hype up on this event...
Hell yeeeehaaaaaaw brother let the freedom unleash september
Cleetus gosh dang it you awesome man you! There's no end to your freedom shenanigans and what you can do, and I love it! I can't wait to see this and I wish I could make it to live but times are hard 😅
Buddy... those cheeks are getting a little crazy. You got a heart attack in your future.
Dude !!! Hell yeah!!
Good luck this weekend. Enjoyed your 1st race.
You guys need to come to Delaware to Dover monster mile would love to see you guys there
Yessss!!!
Say what?????????????  Right on! Bring it Boys!!!
Word? Hell yeah
Hell yeah Cleetus, you rocked in truck racing!!!
I’ve been a Motorsports fan for over 40 years, and Robby Gordon’s SSTs are one of the most exciting forms of Motorsports today. Would love to have one.  Any ride-alongs like Mario’s Indy car in the future?
Cleeter this whole thing is Amazing!!!! You racing the stadium trucks was incredible, except for the last straight……I was on the edge of my seat the whole race….This success couldn’t happen to better guy!!!!!
Bout to be the greatest motor sports event in the history of the world
THIS IS 🔥 NEWS BECAUSE THEM TRUCKS ARE SICK 👍👊🇺🇸🤘
Hell ya brother 👏👏👏
Let's Go!!!! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 Road-trip from Colorado here I come✔️
$10 says Cleetus brings a bigger crowd to Bristol than NASCAR does nowadays.
I am one of my favorite youtubers and you STILLLL havent sent me my Crown Vic Invite........
Jet boat track at ff Boys con cleet make it happen
Don’t slow down for anyone!
When are you gonna invite Paul from Fabrats to an event?
I'm waiting for him to announce that he bought Bradenton drag strip
I want to be Cleetus when i grow up lol
Man you make shit happen dude. Keep on trucking!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't help it but every time I see the truck you drove in your first Stadium Super Truck race I remember the ending and feel immense pain in my soul. You have to win a race some time to restore balance to the world Cleet. My heart can't hurt like this forever.
Don't crash this time!
What a legend
Cleet is the MrBeast of racing
what happend to toronto come on!!!
Man I wish u guy can come over to Illinois  and do something like this
Stadium....super....trucks.
Would you tell robby to finish his freaking side by sides already? Lol
The Giant Giraffe is a big crowd pleaser!
Murica.  Hell yes Love you guys.  Awesome.
Cant wait to get to Bristol! I wish my brother was here for this!
Let’s go congratulations 🍾
Should do figure 8 with a jump one way over the trucks if thats possible
Thats a big HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
AWESOME!!!!!!
So what is it going to take for you to become an SST series regular?
Pretty cool. Making moves!
Just WOW dude!!!!
We need stadium trucks at the freedom factory!
Man, sad you couldn't make mid Ohio in the ssts, but stoked to see you in it further
The only thing to one up your channel is to fully commit to a jet car... Plain as Jane. C'mon, Richard Hammond has crashed what? 2 of them? And a Rimac on uphill? Florida man can't be outdone by British man  Following in Valentino Rossi-Guy Martin footsteps. Keep up the great work and inspiration
So wish the Stadium Trucks  were still here in Australia,  Love to see you racing out here too.
Stadium super trucks, not super stadium trucks ya dyslexic giraffe 😁
Cleetus tearing up the motorsports world LETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hear indy is building a speed boat track next to the burnout pad for 2023 C&C
Frickkkkkkk
Yee yee hoss
Are you live streaming the truck race this weekend?
Damn Cleet your the man! Turns out this man can hop in anything and drive it like a pro. Not many people on earth that can do what you do. Keep up the hard work!
Will Robby Gordon race the crown Vic’s too?
When do you start construction on the Sprint Boat track?  Plenty of room at the Freedom Factory.
If they had the Water, Cleetus would include a Jet Boat Race as well...  Good Times....
Watch in 2023: Rallying racing with Ken Block lol, it's amazing how much of a natural you are at different types of racing
It's gotta have an over under in the middle.
This is going to be so awesome! It's also perfect timing, I had completely forgot to book my campsite. So just got that knocked out. Can't wait for my son to experience his first car event. He's really started showing an interest lately. So, I'm super excited!
When are you going to put the past race on here for us to watch
OUTSTANDING!
Friggin' motorsports Freedom like the free world has never seen!!
You better be in one of those trucks !!!!

Hoping we see a McFarland marine jet boat racing team!!!!!
Thats so awesome congrats on yet another huge deal. Cant wait to see how it all goes down.
That’s so bad ass, hell yeah
Watching you in your last super stadium trucks race where you were SO CLOSE to winning was electric. The announcers were so shocked how well you were doing as were all of us. We hope you win the next one!

America 🇺🇸💪🏼🤙🏼🔧🔩
Imagine if ol Cleet got "into" F1

Excellent partnership for all parties involved!!
I don’t mean this wrong bro but stick to one thing not multiple 😂 you do loads of things and need to stick at one and grind that cos your mid field person
MAN MAKING MOVES! Watch out

Can’t wait🤘🏻🇺🇸
America isn't ready.
I just got goosebumps
Cleetus had a big truck but has he gotten to rip in a real deal monster truck yet? That’s about the only thing he hasn’t done yet isn’t it?
YESSSS
you have gone took far sir... so much freedom
It is THE BEST series in all of racing!!!
Come on over and run your jet boats in the Clinch river. Or at least the Houston river. Breaks interstate park canyon would would awesome with some jet boats echoing in the canyon
Fire me up, Cleeter! THat's a big ol HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
You should try and get a ride in the stadium trucks when they come down to Aus. Would be sick to see you down here!
Are this weekend's events on PPV?
Hell yea brother!
HELL YEAH BROTHER. wish i could afford to go. going to watch for sure tho.
That's the best news I've heard in a while. Can't wait. It's also my birthday weekend. Even better
Used to race stadium lites (honda fl350s,fl450s, briggs built buggies, etc)  Short course offroad racing is what pulled me away from drag racing. Alot more fun for less money.
Holy carp!  Still wish I lived in the midwest.
What about the people that paid for the yearly prescription do we get to watch this race too
This man is gonna be the Walt Disney of the automotive world one day.
Freaking excited for this! Hell yeah brother!!!

Jumps on a high bank oval?   Wish I could be there but got the Cleeter Crew package so I will not miss this.
Holy s...! The weekend is going to be amazing and totally crazy! Guess the wife and I are not going to get anything done that weekend and have to stock up on supplies beforehand!
Before we all know it there will be a Jet Boat Sprint track and a burnout pad in the center of oval you race at.
That’s awesome buddy thanks for sharing
AWESOME!!!!
This guy is a freaking legend. 🔥  like foreal he's the best on YouTube. Can't wait to see what the next adventure is gonna be
HELL YA!!!!
65 bucks is a steal for tickets
🦅🤙😎🤙🦅
How close are you to selling out bristol?
Sill laughing MAO , was watching live when you stuffed it in the wall . 🤣🤣🤣 , sorry , didn't mean to bring up old sh!t ...
I’m thinking the next big announcement will be that he’s digging out a jet boat race track out in the back of the freedom factory. Hell yea brother!!
Son of a Gun!!  I was trying to make it but I have so much going on and didn't want to leave the family home for the weekend.   Now it is almost impossible not to go.
This man doesn't quit. Unreal dude.
I still wanna see you by Kentucky Lake Speedway and make a freedom factory 2
Sweet  Cletus for the win 👍
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
Oh shit,  I just came..
Cleetus/Garrett you're the man! You've shown you can wheel anything! Way to go!
Its crazy how big of a following and crowd you bring everywhere you go. Definitely what motorsports needed to bring in more asses in the seats
My invitation Musta got lost somewhere down the line.
I'm withdrawaling from Cleetus lmfaoooo I need video ahaahahaaaa
Awesome
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!
SAAAAAWEEEEET!!!!
WOW this is about to be one the greatest events in Motorsport history!
So when is that sprint boat track going in at the Freedom Factory!
I have the ppv pass, but I just couldn't watch Bristol on tv. I bought tickets for both days, and rented a nice house 5 minutes from the track. Looking forward to this after missing out on meeting Cleetus and crew at Indy. See you there brother!
Probably will get this ppv, would love to see those trucks in person but I wouldn't be able to swing that trip this year.
Let's go baby!!!!!! Keep up all the work man you are living the dream!!!!
YESSSSSS
