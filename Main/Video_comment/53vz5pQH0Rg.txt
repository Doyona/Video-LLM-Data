Why does he seem like he is pretty much jacking Dababys whole style. Even does Dababys dance that he does in his songs. Everything reminded me of Dababys… the lyrics, the video, the way Jake danced and everything he did in the video as well.

This man’s ghost writer is on a new level but jake Paul yeah global warming is still a big deal so everyone instead of taking private jets u should just 1st class on a normal plane or go to that continent/country another way like boat swimming electric cars trains anything really and donating to team seas more then team trees cause team trees plant trees which in the long run works but for short periods of time try donate to a place that stops the cutting of trees cause the Amazon rain forest 50% have been cut down there is a really good animator who made a video a really long time ago im sure most of you know but it’s called ‘MAN’
Just sharing the good news :) Do you know Jesus Christ? We are all sinners, with sin there is punishment from God, but good news is that Jesus paid the punishment for the whole world's sins, He died, and rose from the dead on the 3rd day. you are ONLY forgiven and saved by putting faith in Jesus Christ
That's chleeeba

It is a massive improvement from his past songs.
Praise, Thank, Follow, Honor, Believe In The Heavnly Father, The Heavnly Father's Son Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior, and The Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior Son Of God Died For Us So We Could Be Forgiven For Our Sins and Go To Heaven and Live With Him Forever. When Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior Son Of God Went Up To Heaven, He Asked God To Send The Holy Spirit To His Disciples and Guide Them and Help Them Amen. Believe In The Heavnly Father, In The Heavnly Father's Son Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior, and The Holy Spirit. Amen. God, Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior, and The Holy Spirit Bless You. Amen.

Everyone saying the song is bad or it hits different on mute. The song is a banger. But he didn't write the song
This actually a HIT!!! For the Ghostwriter lol no cap the bars are hard👀
This song hit different when you deaf

Your drunk
its good because he didn't write it
What are you doing that Paul I am a big fat are you I want all of your YouTube video you hear making a song quit cussing really let me my mom videos
He skipped leg day
Desiiner is doing wonders for you
2:06 was the best part
That ghost writer needs more credit cause Jake Paul didn't come up with the lyrics and the flow all by himself. Someone has to help this lazy dude on his songs that's tuff.
JP for live
es tupido
Sound like No suburban
The ghostwriter needs more credits
jake paul: thinks hes good Also him: gets depression looking at the comments Also him: calls the pandemic a hoax cause hes a idiot
Who else just clicks on the vid to dislike?
you should fight someone who actually boxes lol ,,,, wilder
Bro I disliked Jake Paul until I heard this song yes he might has a ghost writer but like he can rap idc what u guys say
Jake Paul has never been in any form of “Prime”
So fresh outta London 2

Straight fire
Its actually kinda fire
Oo96
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow a music video from Jake Paul that doesn't have more dislikes
1:53 Try tilting ur neck a bit to see how ''HIT'' your songs actually are
Basically all of Jake Paul's songs are just he showing how rich he is or rather how much money he incurred from his parents
ur 23 but u stll act like 9
Honestly slaps
I like how the rapping part is only 34 seconds
I can’t lie this song kinda slap
Is this lowkey.... a bop?
This dude won't get props for a rap artist or a boxer cause he's a youtuber but his a great youtuber
Someone definitely wrote this for him
The ghostwriter prolly has a better voice than you
this song hits different with ur volume on 0
Literally searched sh!t music and was second
Jp smokes
Bro I love haters!. Just proves these people are jealous!. Fuck all the haters Jake!. Knock em down one by one.

Gay bros
206 is my favorite part
He isnt bad at rapping, he just needs a ghost writer to make anything good
Jayden
I think he’s just trying to hard tho

1:53 Lol the fact that he felt the need to address the accusations of 'ghost writers' imo suggests its true
Jake go da drip
when u know he didn't write or produce any of it so literally he's lip syncing and ...dancing? but to everyone else who worked on the music 🔥🔥🔥
This hits hard when you yeet your phone
Good job designer you have been very good ghost writer to make this guy alright
This song is nuthing but fire
his music has potential, but he ruined it with his image to begin with
😈😈😈😈😈😯👍🙊🏰🌃🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
tbh he really doesnt deserve these beats
Ok this song kinda lit thou
YOOO the song sound's better at 1.25 speed NO CAP
1:43 that's A lot of money
Jake: she fucked up the ride Me: What?
Jake Paul cares about nature since he recycles his music z
imagine watching yourself in these videos and thinking you're balling
He's 23? He looks 28
Great music Jake😀😀 EDIT:🧢
This is different when you're deaf
2:01 JESUS
E
Me: Uh  Jake paul: she  fucked the car :me what?
everyone needs that straight outta london  vibe bruh
I love how he thinks people accusing him of ghost writers means that he’s making good music, when really it’s fact his bars are mass produced industrial unpersonal trash, everyone knows they ghost written tho

🤮
J'adore
Yeah guys he TOTALLY wrote this himself. It sounds like half time he doesn’t even know what he is talking about.
good job jon
He says KSI music getting worse😂 He's actually dropping a banger after the other. He's last songs were all in top 40...just to remind you.
Hay Hay Hay DAB ON THEM HATERS!
Jake paul keep on doing what your doing what your doing despite that haters in these comments I support you
"alright time to dislike :)"

No one:  Jake when he smokes a cigarette:  btw it means he thinks smoking is cool just for the snowflakes in the back XD
This is pretty🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My fav ISIS song, FIREEEEEE Fact: CIA once used this song to torture terrorist to get them to spill information, everyone died in the room.
you defiantly didn't wright this
We ain't goin to tlk bout how he sitting on that tip of the money bag through the video like um he keeps sitting on it like he likes it like tfffff
Wow dude that’s awesome
Hell yeah
Cool you flipped me off
Some youtuber siad your bad and your gilfriend
Some poor producer is watching one of their fire beats be used for Jake Paul. Sad
His ghostwriter is kill jasper 100%
The people that pressed the like button on this song is because of exposure to this song is the leading case to low IQ, cognitive brain damage, stupidity, seizures, and other nasty side effects. So they thought they pressed the dislike button but accidently pressed like button. 😔😔😔😔
this has a good flow why everyone dislike this song
never knew this existed until i saw ksi's video trying to react to it   also  in comments didn't even listen to it
Let's be honest, you searched for the Miley Cyrus and Wiz Khalifa song
Jake paul you was saying the same things 🤣🤣🤣
This is lit 🔥
Someone else edits for him
1:31 loving the moves
good
Cool 😎
this is worse than i could have possibly imagined
Ksi songs keep getting worse Jake look at Spotify then talk
he is literally copying drake and jack harlows flow
in jakes defense this is actually pretty good, flow beat and bars. Now he's nowhere near JJ and he never will but fair enough
Song hits hard when u slam ur phone 23 times and 2 At a time
I like how he says that KSI’s songs keep getting worse when this is literally Fresh Outa London v2
23.
Just reported this video fore child abuse so someone who works at YouTube has to watch the whole thing
I’m evil 🤬
Why just why
Jake a smoker
I actually like this song on mute
Mad he said feds  😂
Why would the feds b watching this man
HODNE DOBRY
Me : want to hear miley cyrus 23 song Me : searching (23) Youtube : i know what you want (jake paul 23) Me : (@_@)
I’m a KSI fan but this bangs
Man can’t live in peace😂
He shouldn’t be allowed to compare himself to Jordan, at all. Like stick to what you are good at, like telling 5 year olds what swear words are.
I’m so sick of hearing   “How am I 23”  “I like them 2 at a time”   “I like the seats that recline”
Fresh out of London better edition  He still didn’t write it
this song sounds like sum idk what tho lol
uhhh
☣️
Is it me or Jake Paul's vids are gettin really bad since he started to make these types of vids
Matthew 3:2....
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon....
Any other rapper could’ve made this a banger :/
bar for bar huh
clown
If cringe was a person
Hey this guy seems annoying he should start an internet drama
jake paul is the best youtuber jake paul is my favorite youtuber jake paul is a god and a legend
Jake haters y’all gonna be surprised when Jake knocks out ksi😂
I dare him to nigga just once tho
This it wat happens when a white mom buys her kid southpole and grills

"JaKe PaUl MaDe AnoThEr HiT sOnG"  Also jake paul: " It'S eVeRyDaY DaY BrO!"
I love this song
Am I the only one who enjoys Jake❤️
I only came here to dislike
I'm a fan I'm gonna to died in 10 days
We all know you didn't write this

I've known dis guy sins he was like 15 and I look on vine lol I was 4 then btw dis can't be a ghost writer for this song this stuff sounds like some stuff he would say like if u agree.
The like to dislike ratio could be better
oh let me skip this ad
damn i never knew jake could handle sitting on 23 man even for james charles thats hard
Kinda heat
That's a whole lot of R's you mean W's
O.k. to be the best way to do this for you have a great time to do it again in a heartbeat
Mjmjmjm
He just fell into the wrong crowd
Was it me or was Tanna a one of the pop urse
2:06 thank me later
*Bro, the only prime jake had was Amazon prime*
This song has inspired me to go deaf. Thank you!! <3
Watching this at 1 percent so I know he'll be gone in a few seconds
if he wrote this by himself then i cant lie its a banger
This is kinda bad in my opinion
king

bro this song is just Jake repeating the chorus
Ok but Logan’s part was the best part of this song
WTH was that “no cap” in the begging like the way he said it was like he was like in his late 30’s early 40’s tryna be “hip” or “gangsta” or “up with the trends” like wtf man

I think the only surprising thing about this song, is that it has more likes than dislikes
Saying the same thing every sec
Ur such a flexer
This song is actually fire😳 But like...  come on u can’t go from “every day bro” to this even if “every day bro” was made 30yrs ago. This man definitely has a ghost writer.
Desiner knows how to make music huh
New to Jake Paul and love this dude, he so confident hope he keeps winning because if he gets knocked out I probably won’t like him anymore

Jake’s iq: lower than how far I put his mum
Same song againg!
The song is good but I liked Logan’s cameos
Jake Paul always surprises me people say he can’t talk welll look at him now he could rap no 🧢
If This was made in quarantine there is a problem. Honestly, this is unfortunate that a popular creator is showing a bad example to his young crowd. This is just sad ☹️😭
No body doesn’t like the seats that recline bruv
Lol
No cap why does it sound good 💀
You make me want to end it all
I like the lyrics.. Who wrote them for you ?
Umm.. I kinda like it. I think.
Did you just burn 23 mil

Void has shat on with his part 2 on you.......and your on beat aswell
I love this song
I want old Jake back honestly.
You start out with... Is Jake getting good at writing? Then you listen to “Ima Knock Joe Weller Out”. Then you realize he’s about as talented at writing music as Yoko Ono and he kidnapped T-Pain to write for him.
Who's still watching December 2020
i liked logan’s part more than jakes
you ain’t makin it on billboard just stop it dis cancer
At 1:17 you can see Arica
I love this song
i'm just on a jake paul disliking spree
Like an even shitta version of MGK! Didn't think that could be possible, but quite clearly it is
Me keep listening tO Thai Song instead of doing My homework
Where is LP?
someone rapped this for him and he just make it like him.he isnt able to make such flow and ryhmes by himself
Dislikes are all ksi fans lmao
Why
Jake do you watch Anime
Who's watching after he literally  killed Nate
Guys : Watching in silence  Girls : Dancing uncontrollably  *Legends : Scrolling through comments*

Who is this guy please someone explain I’m confused he sounds like a constipated duck
Ya know even tho it's the same thing over and over again, you gotta admit that going from "it's everyday bro" to this, is impressive
lmao jake is stealing flows
This isn’t that bad which tells you the the didn’t write this
impressive sounding bars, but if you take a closer look he wrote this after smoking crack
This might be Jake's best song..
I liked Logan’s performance more than Jake’s .
How did jake wake up even know it was dark when they robbed the bank
When a virgin fxcks their crush:
6th grader rapper my guy.. im a fan of him over 4 years look how he treat his fans.
Mans really pinning the only comments that has said this song was good lol
I also turned 23 this year, I'm 97' line.

Fresh out of ksi songs keep getting wores and how about he gets a reverse card
No smoking Jake

The best part is at 2:06
If ksi  preformed this would be much better
Imagine likeing a jake paul song
fire bro
This song is bad
All the people who dislike what’s the point?
A perfect display of just how terminally ill the mainstream music industry is in America. People have been so demoralized to where they have now completely forgotten what music should be and how to recognize it. It's hopelessly frustrating just watch all the apathetic music drones watching the former art burn to the ground.
roach
Void use the same beat and still better than yours
That beat tho 💥
It sound just like did it again
This is the first time i had to turn off the captions on a video (im deaf btw)

Remember when he would make kids content? Yeah me either
the reason this song is called 23 is because jake paul's ig is 23

The fact that this sounds like most mainstream rap these days is a testament to how trash rap has become. Theres no more skill or authenticity in the mainstream. You could play this at the club and most people wouldnt know better.

Jake Paul- Releases a new music video Everyone- Where's the dislike button
This the only good one 😭😭😭💩💩💩
It’s ok
Jake should quit and just rap
A 10 year old kid can sing better than you
POV:U disliked his video even tho he deserves the dislikes
I kinda like the song so that means he probably didn’t write it
CORNEY AF
why did I thought he was on his early 30s or late 20s or something
Shh low key fire lol
Raps like rsk dubai
time cline vibe prime  thats all
Some of that was so cringe 😬

Lyrics are good but his voice with the lyrics makes me wanna drink bleach, and second of all he didn’t write any of these lyrics except for the beginning where he said no cap and that wasn’t even a lyric
It’s a pretty good song to be honest
Damn why was this fire
I hit the like button Jake Paul
At the light bar button Jake Paul
Everyone hit that like button for Jake Paul

When Jake releases a song and is decent I'm 101% sure he didn't write it by himself
Har har har poop
Haram

Those girls in the car are your cousins right?
Whoever is part of the ksi gang like this message
No cap No cap no cap no cap no cap
I love you. Call me
I like it
This is a banger      if it was on mute
Just an example
I know it sounds stupid but its all happening for a reason so if you wrote truly about "sex doesn't make me happy, I'm empty" etc you'd be really helping. Maybe it does make you happy but I highly doubt it. Your face has always looked dead inside.
Why the hell can't I understand what he is saying? Maybe he is a toddler
Subscriber
You'll never be good as wwe they have 68.2M

Do I like Jake Paul? - no Doesn’t mean I can’t like the song bc this slaps 🔥
This song is really good when it on mute
LMAOOOOOO, it took like 5 years for him to 'write' a good song.
My brother wrote this song
What are you sitting on 23 dollars or 23 million or 23 billion or 23 cents like what are you sitting on
it’s catchy  i’m def so i really like it
Garbage

Math teacher: Jake what's 5x3? Jake:

Man I miss 23 fun damn time baby lol
jake: Strate to the bank... NO CAPP
Woo Jake Paul becoming cool?
I'm sorry but I only like the beat 🔥
why do people even sub to him he is just a knock oof Travis Scott
Maybe Jake should stick to what he's good at like making crappy clickbait vlogs cuz he cant sing/rap.
Nice song Jake
This song is fire I will play on replay fire 🔥
I wonder if he liked the travis burger
This song hits hard when it’s on 2.0x
I’m sorry this was just simply dope
his dancing look like a seizure but that offensive to seizures
corona should get rid of trump and him together lmfao
Jake Paul comes out with a hit song I watch it 1,000,000×23 was probably the best one yet keep making hit songs
You're consistently the most stupid person I've ever seen
You know why Jake Paul has so many dislikes is because he has a ghost 👻 writer.
like this vibe !
i hope ksi and jake one day fight so this man can finally get knocked out
Alguien que able en español??
He's a embarrassment
Its actually great..,..2020 is really unexpected
I'm enjoying the comments more than the song 😂
Y’all actually hating this song is fire
Definitely didn't deserve so many dislikes
Fire🤗🤗🤗
When you figure your 1% black :straight to the bank mo cap
Tough to look hard when your beat from the  little mermaid
I'm comparing this song and Fresh Outta London to his newest song Dummy. Lyrically wise, yeah that nigga got to ghostwriter 106%. This dude spelled Spichach instead of Spinach in the lyric video 💀
Sounds like narcissism to me.
Hey dicc
"KSI songs keep getting worse"  0:21
when u realize the money is prop
2020 is one weird year.
0:26 -She got rejected
Is it just me or this song sounds like the song "VIBEZ" by DAbaby?
This song is actually the best song out of all the other songs
he copied the beat from lil baby the bigger picture
I swear 2020 just keeps getting worse
50 years later, jake will look at this in regret
This is absolute GARBAGE
Hope you go bankrupt
All content seems to link to money
You remind me of my uncel BJ
this song hits diffrent on mute 😂😂
23 x 3  That’s all
Who TF likes this 😹 who song is garbage and even if it was okay it's basically less than two minutes long.
🔥
All the money is come from Logan’s bank account

I like how all of his comments are haters but it’s just making him money 59k comments that’s a lot of money
Song was good but good you know
Ngl why does he still act like a 2 yr old
he wonders why his girlfriends sorry wifes leave him
00:04
Every music video he makes he always end up getting a lot of dislikes lmao
I made a vid of my brother peeing in a cup during a road trip if anybody wanna watch it

In a KSI fan but I have to say.....THIS IS FIREEEEE
Why? I’d rather be a homeless guy, brutally fighting other homeless fighting for a piece of bread instead of being a white douch who thinks he can rap.
🔥
Flow sounds like he copied juice wrld ~ Barbarian

No matter how you feel about Jake Paul, you can’t deny how fire his songs are.
This is actually nice
Why did he differentiate now
Dude just shut the hell up
I have been watching you since you were 20
Who tf is 23 ima make a song called 24 and take the beat
Today I broke my leg and I’m in a wheelchair    But i still got up to turn off his music
What’s worse Jake Paul or his fan base that made him famous?
Miley Cyrus “23” song is better than this, and that ain’t saying much.
U smoking sum gasss ayeee
Never say no capp again
Logan’s gloves were green screened
never thought of saying this but i really liked the song... man, i wish it lasted a little more

Wow if only he had ghost writers before its everyday bro
What I find so facinating is that EVEN IF he got ghost writers...what in the fuxk doctor think other artists do? Do me a favor and check your favorite artists song and look at how many people are credited in making ir
Every hater down here knows jake Paul is lit....
Never say no cap again pmz
Omg thats so cool global warming has increased
I sang this same song on my schools music festival

Rappers have more success than you have like people almost give you more dislikes than like you got people to write down lyrics and ksi thinks of the lyrics
low key pretty Fire/banger song.. GG Jake..
He smokes ?

When a white kid tries the Travis Scott burger.

Worst thing ever
quit youtube and start rapping you would be a big hit if you start rapping
This is really similar to Dababy's flow
Im prolly gonna get attacked for saying this but why does he look and sound like he's trying to be a black rapper?
Looks like jake has been playing with louigi board cuz this song got ghosts all over it
Everything Erika Costas in walking around she's nice you can see Erika Costa really good on YouTube
I love the jake paul woke up and people are outraged like that's too true
As a basketball Fan, This is a disgrace to the Jordan name
At least he believes in global warming I guess

This comfy is very good
23 is the most fire song out right now compared to any rapper no cap
Ten pocit že to je Čech a má 20 mil subs
This song is actually good

Imagine clamming so much money and you can’t even afford a original  MJ Jersey? Foulllll
Welp that is a lot of 💰 did you accidentally broke your piggy bank???
Who else misses old jake

Producers: you just wanna say the f word 30 times?  Jake: 💯%
Who else want’s ksi to beat jake paul .
This song isn’t even 2 minutes long and it’s still the most repetitive song I’ve ever heard.
no way mans went from its everday bro and ohio fried chicken to fresh outta london and  23    jake paul: *choughs in ghostwriter*
he literally stole a drake lyric for his chorus
Isn’t this the song that hits hard on mute? 🥶

When designer writes his songs: fire 🔥 but when jake paul writes it own songs ITS EVERYDAY BRO WITH THE DISNEY CHANNEL FLOW

Im going to be honest, the only reason why this video has dislikes is only because It's Jake Paul music video

You feel like Jordan in your prime?  1. You are never as good as Jordan in whatever field you're comparing yourself to  2. So you agree your prime is gone and its been downhill from here then?
You sound like everyone in the game. Get your own vibe, you'd stand out more
I really like jakes ghost writer

I like logan's music better
Rolls or Bentley you can’t decide what? which one to rent?
Bigger
Wow, this is garbage. You people actually like this?
If it weren’t for social media could you say you tried to change for the better instead of trying to get your under age clicks

Best song a youtuber has ever made
1:04 me and my ex girlfriends boyfriend
This is fresh outa London 2.0 like stop doing the same type of rapping bro
Ok this is fire, but you have to admit that you have a ghost writer. It's so obvious that you have a ghost writer, JJ even showed the ghost writer in Fresh Outta London.   Edit: I just wanna say that having a writer is fine but you should always admit that you had someone to write the song
i watched hi on vine and then YouTube and now his music all sick love to vibe to them love this guy !!!!!  amazing new songs should put out an Alban
He’s a beast
Jake didn’t right it probably designer again

Jake Paul is the type of guy who would try to buy an Apple watch from a produce store.
So basically...this is fresh outta London part 2.....🤦🏼‍♂️
This man said he made a hit
Who remembers team 10 the old one
Like bro no one like u know that u lil flexer
Seriously this is probably the most lit song he made yet
One thing is that he said he got the paparazzi waiting at his door when his brother is more famous than him -.-
i love you ksi but this tune bangsssss
sitting on 23 sitting on 23 with an IQ of 13
All the subs and likes are from racist white 12 year olds who are most likely American. Call me a stereotypical but we all know it’s true
Insanely fire get it at the end
Who came here from the everyday bro video 😭✋
Did I found out Jake smokes?
When you get your first pay check:
All those nine year olds, that’s where you’re merch money goes children
That was so good song I love it
KSI: *clears throat*
There’s only like 2 verses-
Pll who miss the old jake paul

Jesus is coming 🙌 Get saved💙 ; 9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
if you know this off-by-heart, i’m so sorry.
Who’s here from his TikTok
Jake you a legend bro ,well done   The song is fire 🔥
Yoooo
Jake why do u smoke and drink be ur old self no smoke and drinks
At 0:35 gangsters : why you throwing gang signs
This is low key fire
Ghost writer 100%
Even if the song is good it’s tradition to dislike a Jake Paul music video
Is it just me or is this song kind of nice?
Your last song is way better
Are we gonna talks about him smoking a blunt
Write a song without a ghost writer or at least have the courage to admit someone else wrote it 🤣
Its ok
Love how your that bad you have to get your own brother for a music video
when u realise that ur 23 percent black
Hot garbage
I love how he has almost the same amount of dislikes as likes
I ain’t gone lie this shits actually fire, this and his other song he just dropped
What does this guy even do besides stir up drama and make shitty music?
Wow so great
Cmon guys lets dislike this video so he can have more dislikes than likes
If you like Jake Paul then    You must have the same IQ as him 😎
Wow in 1:17 minute my dude had a airpod so desiigner could help him with the lyrics
When you have too much money you have to half flex
La puta madre que buena canción
jake should drop 23 jersys the we could put are last names on
Lame
Can we hit 300k dislikes :)
As a nigerian man once said   "this is fresh outta london part 2"
Hey yo Jake I was just wondering if I could use this song as background music for my YouTube, thank you I will add your link to the description if you do
Will u ever grow up 😂

Thank you Jake. For helping me fight my terminal paralysis. Today this song was being played, and I finally overcame my terminal disease and stand up and run my way to stop this detritus from being played. Surely I cant be the one.

Had all that money in the video but can’t play bills 😂
Alr no cap I like fresh outta London better
Why are people liking his songs. This is basically just flexing and talking about sex.
I love your songs
Tothe people who liked the video is probably a physcopath
Ur clapped
This bang on silent
My sunglass listened to this  Now it's a wine glass
This advert doesn’t have a skip button 🤔
Had to come back and hit the dislike button again.
Thank you jake you really saved me with your music, someone run up on me but then i played this and the guy killed himself. Thank you
U could've donated all that money to Africa...
2020 be like:
I haven’t even listened to it and I’ve already disliked it.
This song is so basic, it balanced the pH scale
0:09 set 8 kids when they get given access to the icecream truck
He doesn’t right this 😂
Hola
I really miss the old Jake Paul
This shirt fire no kap🔥🔥
Is it just me or jake paul is coping daBaby
harddd.
Fresh out of London was better to me no offense but this beat threw it off for me
When you find out your 1% black
Jake paul channel starring jake paul
When you go from new vevo logo, to old vevo logo, to custom music video logo.....
am i the only one to come on this video to dislike?
How am I 23% on my phone?
Why the hell did he add that ugly ass *MUSIC VIDEO* stamp to all of his song thumbnails
Void ended u bud go back to Ohio
Oh my gosh
Fire
If he keeps this up I will literally buy every album
23 was the amount of seconds it took me to find out how fire this is
no gonna lie its better then every day bro
Is better when u forget Jake's rapping the song
Okay but this fire
Maybe his music isn't written by someone else
My parents have $6 million
This song is sooo fire
Fire
He sooo good, better than 6ix 9ine
It’s a goastrighter

i bet you guys just hating on jake. But he's a nice guy you know, just keep up with him
No  Cap

Why everyone hyping this song up like it ain't fresh outa London v2
The fresh outta London copy wasn't bad it had some good bars from the ghost writer, the only problem was Jake Paul is in it.
y pensar q era un actor piola :v
Hot garbage
am office scared 😷
You said a cuss word
Dang i love ittt😝😝😚😚😜😜😍🥰
Just because he raps doesn’t mean he has to be black omfg
If it wasnt for them old cringe vlogs & songs he wouldnt have had over 200k dislikes😂
Yes I like rap but this song makes me wanna listen to K-pop
it's annoying that he's as fine as he is..
1:04 moment of silence for news reporter just doing his job 😂

This song and fresh out of london both go hard. But i think a feature can take it up a notch and get more plays because the song is short. Dababy would be sick on one. But either way shits hard. P.s. Go BUCKS!
When people watch his song:  then using it as a meme

“I got the feuds watching haters watching news watching that’s a whole lot of eyes” 😳
Your audience is so young that they cant even speak their mothers tongue.
This man has to give his ghost writer a raise 🚫🧢
I like how it’s actually true when he says the haters still watching
Looks like disliking Jake Paul is a tr3nd and I joined :)

You may think your some bad ass now but be Warned, Everyone pays for their crimes eventually

Jake Paul you smoke
Trust in Jesus he died for your sins, believe the gospel. Repent!!! If you do sin confess your sins, ask him to help you overcome your sins he will. Obey Jesus, live by his teachings, be led by the Holy Spirit. The Lord is coming soon you must live by his teachings. The love of God is beyond our understanding  God bless .....

I wonder if jake even looks at his videos after he uploads them, cause the amount of likes to dislikes are almost equal
Lets congratulate jake paul on the fact that this is his first song with slightly more likes then dislikes
It hurt my eyes when I looked at him because he’s white af  he also reminds me of boy woah Vicky
Guys I know jake paul. We were friends back in high school and I occasionally come to his house to play some sonic adventures 2 battle. Lol those where some good times. It's sad to see him put the vevo logo on every song he makes. And it's also sad because he still has my game cube with my copy of sonic adventures 2 battle. So jake. Give back my game cube with my copy of sonic adventures 2.

Who is writing these songs, jake Paul doesn’t have the brain capacity to even think
I love how he pinned the only positive comment
he has a ghost writer. a ghost writer is someone that makes the music but the person making the music video dosent @ them
Even if Jake Paul wrote it he still got to put his voice on it and deliver it
After listening the song, I just remembered one famous quote.  "ENGLAND ISN'T A CITY"
Is this lil dicky?
He took the term fuck up the system to literally this song is so bland and boring

But it has the same beat as straight out of london
When jake has to much money
"I like the seats that recline" ok... guessing you're talking about car seats... every car seat reclines. Even if it's like an office chair what the fuck type of flex is that. Shoulda just said, "BUT CAN YOU DO THIS?"
0:53 this image of him basically being penetrated by his own cartoonish exaggeration of the superficiality of riches and fame epitomizes everything this guy is about. A freudian slip of epic proportions.
I miss him when he was younger

To be completly honest with you, I like this song, and especially the beat, although his god damn voice is so fkin annoying. But just because it's Jake Paul I can't be asked to listen to it. I listened to it once and since then I've been comming here only for the comments, like the other 99% of sane people.
I wonder when you’re gonna write your own lyrics 🤦🏻‍♂️
Money changed u

Fresh outa london 2
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara para justificarnos para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvo", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios!!
Wow the fact that is getting disliked raided is so funny

Jake Paul's songwriters, editors and all over people who made this song: "So Jake how much autotune do you want to add to th-" Jake: "*YES*"
reaction
boring and uninspired
Bruh is legit the same lines over and over again with like no in between
This song would be good if it was good
This is just fresh outa London part 2 🤣-KSi
From now on this is going to be music only channel, since Jake is too ashamed to do anymore vlogs.
Jake Paul You Think Your Black
I just realised he named the song by the number of ghostwriters he used
smh
he named the song after the number of ghostwriters he had
We all know he wrote 0% of this. Im supposed to believe that the idiot who cant spell words correctly in his tweets can write a bar?
Bar for bar is it 😂😂😂
My name is Jake and I like Lamborghini
How come Jake got all the ghost writers in his song and still it's trash?
This is heat
wypipo

Wonder who wrote this one?
CuredMyOwnDepression
I swear people just come on here to dislike the video  That’s where his views are coming from 😂😂😂
Matter of fact that he has naked women in his videos. Why aren't his videos age restricted? His fan base is just a bunch of 9 yr olds lmfao lol.
The difference is so obvious compared to Straight Outta London. This song is just more proof that on the last song you had a ghost writer lmao
Jake paul gets pounded by ksi
You’ll never know what this comment said

Jake rapping just makes me crease
Here comes the hater wave
It’s the smoking for me
I love how Jake Paul has to use autotune for his voice to be bearable
why is this song actually good
It’s the London song part 2 😂
Just the fact that he compares himself to the goat Jordan just makes me wanna punch him more
Fresh out of London was better
I think he's 23 sitting on 23 correct me if I'm wrong.
Whelp I haven’t watched for a long time 😭😭
Trash
hits different on mute
Amazing 👌👌👌
Is the 23 the amount of ghostwriters? only part I liked was Logan's Verse
Addicted to this song 😂😍
A well-earned "dislike".
Is it just going to be a fucking trend that all of Jake Paul's videos are going to hundreds of thousands of dislikes.

Who wrote this one? Deesigner as well?
Fresh outta london 2.0 😉
Why this sounds good jake Paul?
Uhhh , I strangely like this
Why do I feel like 90 percent of the people who watched this just wanted to see how bad it was
He glitched at 0:54
this man doesn't deserve 200k dislikes on this song. It's lowkey heat
🔥
You deadass disrespecting M 23

He doesn’t realize that people click just to dislike the video lmao
When a white kid after saying the n word
Your just mad you could never make it in the music industry like ksi
WHY IS HIS MUSIC GOOD MY BRAIN HURTS
Bruh someone got pined because they said good song
sounds like the sequel to fresh out of london
🤢🤢🤮
This song is gay
I vomited when I heard this and I'm a toaster
Let’s take a moment to remember that this is the same virgin from vine 😐
This is literally the definition of a Mumble rapper
I've never seen so many haters in my life!!!!
When are you going to post a new video in your channel and tudes  the one you guys both made
100% ghost writters
this is terrible wow jake you just stick to vlogging to be tryna make music wow this had me laughing it was so funny
My name is jordan
This is the best song  I have ever heard from jake Paul 🔥
So... he doesn't write his own music and that's fine but I like the way he raps
*KSI and his fans are wrong to call this song a Part 2 to Fresh Outta London because the flow is clearly different. Jake Paul makes better music than KSI. KSI is clearly jealous of Jake Paul and KSI is just a hater.*  *Lawls!!! 😂😂😂*
Ok, so just another Fresh Outta London, nice creativity.
Who are those girls in the car ddoes anyone know them?
Jake if u pin this u will make better music
Wtf happend to yo
Yo what if Jake kidnapped his ghost writer that's why the fbi searched him
Buddy changed-been 2 years since I've seen u...last vid i saw from u was SHER LOCK PAUL..now....WHAT THE FUDGE DID U TURN INTO?! I USED TO WATCH U 24/77777

I kinda like fresh outta London better
KSI: "Lets see his monthly listeners"
When it’s the exact same flow as his last song 💤
lowkey sounds like vibes??
Jake congrats on the new song love it and hope you come out with more fire songs love it
Dame this song fire though 🤤
My brother listened to this song he wont stop foaming from the mouth  help...
Yeah that 23 he is sitting on is pretty much ares we have him
jake paul for life
1:31 is chalked full of cringe
This song is actually good
Why does this exist trash
When is going to accept that everyone fucking hates his music?
I likes the dislike
0:41 let's stop here what on earth is this? This is basically fresh out of London like come on. God knows if he even wrote this like come on.
And the song is stupid
Song are good more keep more coming
“Me and my homie went bar for bar in the studio”
Hold on.......     This lowkey slap 🕺🏾
This basically part 2 of fresh out of London
Hands down Jake's ghost writer will make anyone believe in ghost
the only reason jake is getting more views on his music video is because all his viewers are 5 and aren’t old enough to get spotify
So Bad
How he gonna put Ksi’s songs are getting worse when they are literally way better than his songs 😹
DISLIKE GANG WYA?
How do you have ghost writers and still post utter trash
🔥🐐
Every white kid after unpacking a rare pokemon card
Almost more dislikes then likes
These lyrics are genius there just saying the same words over and over again make me think of another rapper GuCcI GaNg x25
Lana rhoades really????
When white kid killed someone in GTA
Lets be honest if ksi was singing the same lyics this would be fire
Who the producer????
This song fire but its ghost written so
If someone like drake sang this song it would be 10 times better
This song hits diffrent on mute
is this a part 2?
Fresh outta London V2
It sounds like he’s rapping with his mouth closed
This songs decent only because he ain't writing them
Setting this as my alarm for school so i can wake up fast to turn it off
That lip sinking tho
cringe
Capitalism gone wrong: the soundtrack.
who wrote this one
Just kidding
Maybe he called his song 23 coz that’s how many ghost writers he has
People are literally only hating on this because it’s Jake Paul... it actually slaps though...
i come here just to dislike
Ksi is the reason I’m here this song just repeats it self and it even sounds the same as the last one do something original/unique
KSI LES ROMPIÓ LA GORRA JAJA
I actually like this....
How sad must Jake's life be to pin a bot comment?
mad cringe
Oh jake got his ghost friend back!
Delete this you still have time
This song is terrible
2020 jake paul has inprooved has⌚🙌
23= Fresh Outta London V2
Guys cmon admit it’s good
Ksi’s songs keep getting worst you think Jake shut up
I like it
Really really good beat
It must have been uncomfortable sitting on that big ass bag of money it has a pointy end must got trough his ass lol
Garbage
This is just Trash Outta London 2
My only question is why is he flexing his Mercedes when he has like 5 Lambo’s
This terrible
Ksi still whooped his ass
shut up jake
Guys stop hating...this song good
So apparently now he’s just gonna start making fresh out of London again but with some different words and plus he has a ghost writer as he said in Logan’s podcast he said yeah me and one friend yeah that counts as a ghost writer 😒
Why Jake Paul looks like Santa Claus   0:35
Does Jake Smoke Or Was It Just For The Video?
i like the like dislike ratio
Bruh he think he a rapper now
If it's a banger its a banger 🤷🏾‍♂️
0:53 his face lol screen tearing
Muh
23 million dollars          Thats a lot of money for a guy who doesnt write his songs.
Big shoutout to his ghostwriter they deserve all the credit ☺️
Literally Fresh Outta London Remix,
stop making songs do videos
My guy calm down you need to think of bars
The fact this man made him self off of being family friendly 🤣🤣
Did Jake Paul forget that without all of us he has all that money so if he didn’t have us what u think he be doing hmmmm...
I thought ghost writes was a joke....Jake def changed my mind
Ghost writers are doing their job 👀
I just came here to dislike. I wish I could dislike without giving him the view.
Make more videos Jake
Bro this is garbage absolutely trash and he has balls to say ksi songs getting worse compare ‘this too loose
Swear bro these new songs are HITSSSSSS
My dude smoked weed

Why does this sound really similar to Fresh out of London seriously if you going to have a ghost writer at least try make the songs sound different
My hand slipped to dislike And I am happy about it
Same as fresh outta london what can  i say
Y’all noticed that Ksi literally pit his video title reacting to jakes song just for the clickbait wtf i wrong with yall
My childhood is now ruined
It wasn't that good
Title should have been "Fresh Outta London 2" TBH
KSI fans are unhealthily obsessed with Jake.
trash
If only this was sung by someone else, this would be straight 🔥 ngl
His ghostwriter hits hard
Jake Paul is garbage ksi is better
Ass then 69 album
i love that the dislikes are almost the same as the likes, les gooo
Lol ksi ft a song and get these numbers ksi just ain't got the skill
Ksi "fuck it this is just fresh outta lindon pt 2"
jake wasn't cappin when he said he spent a whole ass year practicing his music
Freash out of London pt 2  Part 3 comming soon
I SMELL GHOSTWRITER'S!!
This poetry is middle class, I rate. 3
23 seconds is the amount of time Joke Paul will survive against ksi
I was just listing to juice an uh no offence to jake but like ... just no
Jake is living proof that even someone with no talent for music like him can make good songs with the help of talented people.
Ksi is another level better, your so delusional
I love his new music 🎶 BARS "NO CAP" 😂😂
This wasn’t a song this was a hock repeated a couple times with nothing in between
Ew
Pls dislike he is white
When a little kid get a dollar and goes to school and show it off to his friends
"I like them 2 at a time"  (Ctrl C) (Ctrl V) (Ctrl V) (Ctrl V)
Call this song seats that recl8ne
I mean even tho Jake is kinda hated, you can’t lie this music vid ain’t that bad.
If only the song were his. Never mind I still wouldn’t like it.
Back with a banger
Makes Fresh outta London Jake paul: that seemed to do well, I have a great idea! Let's basically release the same song again

Bro nise jack
It’s funny how everyone is hating literally just because it’s  “Jake Paul” ,why can’t ya’ll just appreciate the song and what he’s trying to do with his future music
He smoke weed??
His ghost writer did bits with fresh out of London but this is just the same song but a worse beat the same flow and he just sounds depressed while singing 😂
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
I like to you when you’re funny and now you’re just rated R
I can never like jake Paul because he ate cereal out of diors

Ur ghost writer goes hard 🔥🔥
Soooo he ran out of ideas so he told his ghostwriter to do fresh outta London and change the lyrics
Who here hates Jake and is a KSI fan?

Jake this is lit bro
Who wrote this?
This song is 👉🏽🗑👈🏽
Fresh outta London Pt 2
When someone uses the same beat for the 4827293 time
Fresh out of London part 2 pretty much

Trash
this one of the worst songs i’ve ever heard
We all know you didn’t write this jake
Well, we know at least Jake wrote the shitty lyrics
Fresh outta London part 2 lmao
It’s like fresh outta London probably because that’s his style ppl songs sound familiar when they mess with that style just like dababy
Weak 😂😂😂
2 actually good songs in a row fresh outta london and 23
Two thumbs down, what a dumb video.
Dead
So you smoke now

This is a disgrace to Jordan
Guys we can get more dislikes than likes come on guys
Song hits different on mute
The disrespect to The GOAT doe :/

I wonder who wrote this one, Morgan Freeman?
he might be living my ideal life but at least i can tie my shoe laces
fresh outta London part 2 lol
Soon he’s going to get more dislikes then likes
Uno when the whitest kid on YouTube says “I got the feds watching”

Highly doubt anyone needs a ghost writer to make up 3 lines to repeat constantly for two minutes.
Woah now.. this is fye

Who came back after watching KSI's reaction video and came back to check if it actually sound's the same as Fresh outta London
Fresh out of london: who are you   23: im you
This guy is so unlikeable it’s crazy
Fresh outta London pt 2
idk why but he’s voice doesn’t pass with the lyrics and the beat
It’s so bad 😂😂🤣
Love Logan’s accent
Jake says people are accusing him of a ghostwriter when he confirms it on logans podcast
Jeeeeez he got a talented ghostwriter!
Nice
Even if he has a ghost writer, he still has to spit those words out with 🔥
Derivative.
Yo ksi fans are so mad this song doing way better than loose 💀
When you going to make a album
Crazy how MJ and LeBron fans unite because they feel violated after that MJ comparison.
I love the way that Ksi just couldn’t be bothered listening to the whole song 😂
Looking at this just to dislike
Garbage song by garbage person
One hit wonder

Who else thinks this video is CRINGE
I think this is the first time i wouldn't be Michael Jordan.

no one : Jake and his ghost writer army: aight lets get going with fresh outa london 2
Bro your songs keep getting better
@pd its a remake of fresh outa london
This song is 100 times better                                When on mute
Why is jake Paul’s songs good now well done

Nice car but terrible rims on the wheels
KSI is better
Wtf

I-
Just proves how much of a jerk he is
I like the beat of the song, but that's it
And thiss dude put ksis songs keeps getting worse lol
Logan's accent has me dead
Take a moment to appreciate the KSI fans for coming here just to dislike.   Yk the Ghostwriters vibin bc they know they wrote this.
It’s every day bro🤣
high hat too loud
anyone who thinks this is good is either 13 or doesn't understand how music production works. Anyone can sound good with a fire beat and someone who actually knows what they're doing writing your lyrics. Throw in some audio tweaks and you have yourself a decent rap song with zero substance. You could find every single one of his lines in another song, this isn't creative or good whatsoever.
Jake Paul in the past is angry because he knows in the future he will have ghost writers
Geeeez where's his ghost writers
Would be good if he wrote it himself why can’t he just be honest
"jake paul makes yet another hit song"    look at the likes vs dislikes lol
Rotten outta London
Gg his ghost writers
His newest songs are good cuz he's got nothing to do with the song just song what he was given🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow this trash cuz he got another ghost writer
KSI
Yo if you wrote this, this is catchy af man
Thank you jake you made get up from a wheelchair just to mute your song.
I hated the song at first the second time i put it on mute best song i ever heard in a while
why does jake paul act like he’s so tough
yawns.
What the absolute fuck... it’s literally Fresh outta London part 2. Same beat
"Jake Paul woke up today, people are outraged" Well, they should be...
I was a skeptic at first but now I do believe in ghosts
What the hell is this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ksi definitely won that
Jake make a channel just for music.

Literally fresh outta london
You’re delusional if you think your music is better than KSI’s music
I disliked as soon as clicking on the video but after listening to the whole song I just left without changing a thing.

KSI is still better than you. This isn’t your music or flow. Stick to vlogging and acting like a hyper 8 year old in front of the camera. Goodbye 👋
Jake paul could have a gost writer but this song wad written for him with him.. Like kid kudi wouldn't sound good on this
And yes
No cap better than loose
Is it just me or this is litterally just a worse version of fresh out of london. Man really told his ghost writer to fucking tone it down a bit
Why tf are there more likes than dislike rn???? You’re telling me people like Jake Paul?
Any one that makes this guy sound good, must sum kind of god
Designer and yo ghost writers still ghost writing for you that’s why you started saying the same thing I thought you could at least get another verse.
🔥

No cap the song is good and chill but on muted it’s 10 times better 😂
Like as KSI said it’s basically Fresh Outta London Pt.2 😂😂😂😂
I'm so annoyed this is actually good. If only Jake wasn't singing it
the news was real
I actually kinda like the song, but he is such a bitch :D
I’m sorry but imagine acc being a jake Paul fan did u get dropped at birth or something 😂

this song is pretty great in every aspect except of jakes performance, should just replace him with an actual rapper at this point lmao
That grill. What are you doing. It looks like he got a botched dentist job and they just covered his teeth in glitter to hide it. It looks like when you put those plastic vampire teeth in at Halloween and your lips look swollen
Same exact beat as his fresh in London 🥱🤭
1:58 is a representation of Jake’s career
Fresh out of London part 2
Fresh outta london 2
Ksi is better
KSI’s music is getting worse? Oh that’s why KSI got number one In so many countries. Yet you Jake couldn’t hit number one in America
My favourite part was the instrumental at the end
I just like how Logan’s in this am I the only one?

Jake Paul has one style, and one style only, and still needs a ghost writer to write his bars.
At the beginning of the video, you can see Jake prepare the rope for Logan's trip to Japan

remember when he used to bleep out his swears
This dude really hits the chorus 4 times in a 2 minute song.
He ain’t got the feds watching him😂
This songs complex lyrics lead to a greater question of why humanity was created and where we can go from here this is simply something that can pull any man into a state in which he questions the world around him in an attempt to understand his purpose in this universe and the pain he is in the mere state the world around him is in such a  corrupted state in witch the simple thought of this song makes some of the greatest minds known to man find themselves in an ever lasting loop of confusion and a true look at how insignificant they are compared to this song.
Ew...
The exact same flow and his last song, ghost writer doesn’t change stuff ay?
Am I the only one who likes the MV on mute 🔥🔥🤣

I used to be a jake Paul fan fan then he stopped posting didn’t really like what he was doing and this song isn’t that bad
The only part the ghost writer didn’t write was the part where jake said “no cap”😭
Most of the dislikes just be the people who dislike Jake Paul. I agree he may be a reckless and crazy person but from a music perspective he deserves the props. The lyrics  and beat slap

Who wrote this again ?... he basically paying to songs now, kinda weird
This song is very epic. Hardcore GG to Jake     ‘S ghost writers
FBI open up
I wonder who wrote this one 🤔

Bruh you do know that Miley Cyrus did this thing 6 years ago
He went from family friendly to smoking weed😂😂😂

TRASH.
So yall finna let him dissarpect the Goat like that.
Ghost busters time again

Joey in chat 🤐
I just wanna see KSI vs Jake Paul 😐
In every song: Joey
Jake use to actually be good with the old team
Cough cough gost writer make Ksi sing this it will sound good
This music is trash 🚮
.man used same beat but changed it a bit and got another ghost writter just to make hit
This sounds better on mute bro
oh another gost writer
This song slaps on mute 🚫🧢
Me waiting for Ksi to react:👁👄👁
His ghostwriter makes fire lyrics just give this lyrics to someone else
Shout out his ghost writer
Finally a song that isn’t complete trash and cringe
This is utter shite
why is this lowkey good?
Ksi vs Jake Paul  We know Ksi wins 1st round right
great flow zero content, try again you could actually be great rather then Meh at best.
Your clapped
wonder if he actually smoking gas in that wood 🤔🤔🤔🤔
This song sounds better on mute
🔥🔥🔥 keep doing u jake I been hear for so long and never doubted u
Damn it’s so nice on mute
Fuuck. I like it....
I wonder who the ghostwriter for this song now...
When did my man start smoking weed 😂😂😂
Have him freestyle
No way this dude wrote this
Fix the bass
Jake Paul has the biggest ghost writer
how many people hat want 1000 dollars
TRASH
This song hits different on mute
So who really made this
Who thinks if this wasn't Jake Paul you would like and  sub straight away
23 Seating on 23 - jake paul, 25 seating on 25 mill - Drake
This hits hardddddddd       On mute.
i know he didnt wrote this but this is fire
Jakes new songs are littttt🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wannabe roddy ricch
who wrote this?
Turn this on mute it hits better
Froggy fresh- dunked on is the only rapper who can pull of Jordan Jersey
Now write a song about real world issues rather than paying someone else to write you a song about yourself
Give a shout out the the ghost writers
It would be so funny if nate Robinson wins the fight tho
this song is so good on mute
Just came here to drop a dislike
Shve your beard!
It smells like a ghost writer in here
This deadass better than anything youngboy has put out. Idk if it’s ghostwriters but this actually goes hard
What is that dougie do
Now I thought this was bad but as soon at I turned it too mute it felt so good... on mute his bars his rhythm and everything is amazing...
This track sounds so good on mute but I didn’t like the music video
So i guess you ghost writer had fun on this one
Let jake have  a break for once
what is with 23. did ur teacher ask you how much is 1+1 and u said 23 or what
Who’s the writer this time Jake 🤣
2 of his songs are the only thing he posted that is good since 2018
_“Haters accusing him of having ghost writer”_ Claiming he doesn’t have a ghost writer when we all know facts 👀
As you can see here jake Paul has used his drug money on buying a new gost writer and this is the result it lovely to see half of the likes are dislikes
The only people that watch him are 10 year olds
His songs are getting better, I must admit!.
this is better on mute
Why tf he making decent music now, like bro we all know you got a ghost writer
You know its fricking fire when jake Paul makes it and you say its good
Fun fact: This fire on mute
This song goes hard with no volume🔥
This hits different on mute 💯💨
Hits differently on mute
"I like the seats that recline" LMAO thats called reclining seats
Dude idk why he is trying to hide his ghost writer LMAO
He doesn't write his songs
Imagine if polo g sung this
why are these new songs good (ksi fan here)
yoo this hits hard asf   on mute🔥
Was this "bar for bar” and who wrote this
It hits differently on mute
when you eat the travis scott meal
👻 ✍️
“KSI TUNES KEEPS GETTING WORSE”  At least he has raw lyrics made by him
jake paul should be a music artist
Mans has bars when he is put on mute
We all know he got ghost writers
1:37 regardless if Jake didn't write this song or I can't lie that EVEN with his voice, that part sounded pretty cold
That like ratio is as painful as jakes flows
Jake is the type of guy who forgets to invite himself to his birthday party
Who’s actually going to bump this in there car 😂
This hits different on mute
Who wrote this one?
Funny
Who wrote this bruh cuz its goof
he’s flexing the money that he owes the government
See when u have a ghost writer make sure ur ghost writer doesn't  recycle the same lyrics lol
what yall think of my recent song <3
Where's the ghost writer at 🤨🤨
Wtf this guy still uploading  no one likes him
Haha so many ppl hating in the comments... it’s toxic... no one is rlly gonna acknowledge shit’s fireee

>…>   Erm, it’s actually good for once.
This is sick on mute
Its better to mute it and listen to it.
Fun fact: Ghostwriters made 90% of the song, Jake Paul made 10%.    Disappointing.
This guy really just pinned the only comment saying this song was good
This is so bad wtf likes this
If you think about it Jake Paul is actually really inspiring he’s The only trashcan that Has somehow managed to be      semi-relevant
This is ass
When u ghost writer because he was too trash to make his own sh!t
Jake didnt write this
I only came to look at the Mercedes(Maybach)...
It sounds amazing 💖✨🦋 when it’s muted 🧃🌸✨🩰
The like and dislike ratio 😂😂

He has a ghost writer but this still hits🤷🏾‍♂️
What if Joey is his ghost writer
Another hit song? U aint even top 10 in a offical chart yet lol
I am deaf this song us sick
Imagine if he wrote this…
“KSI songs keep getting worse” the only thing I see worse is your beard, looking like frozen mustard
After this song Mercedes Benz probably removed the reclining seat feature
this song is lit
yo dessigner be going hard on writing song
this hits different on mute
Unpopular opinion: This song bangs
bro the ghostwriter got bars
Jake doesn’t deserve the fame
"KSI's Song Keep Getting Worse" Says the guy who made songs like Its Everyday Bro and Ohio Fried Chicken - Jake's songs have only gotten slightly better because he found a ghostwriter
No cap this is 🔥
Listen to it on mute
"this puts a smile on my face"
It’s funny cause most his views are jake haters which is why so much dislikes you guys know your basically just giving him you money by disliking
Team Ksi
White NBA YoungBoy at the start

Dear Jake Paul, your fans need to be 18 to be able vote
SHITE
His song hits better on mute
I’m guessing Jake Paul didn’t wrote this song
I came to dislike the video
How many ghost writers does Jake have? 23
Will he ever learn
Imagine all the Young Jake Paul fans looking up to his "Trendy" actions. You guys must be soooo "Edgy"
Ayyy
They must’ve gotten a better writer for this one
Who has been watching Jake since he had 3 mill
People who disliked most okey didn’t even listen to the song
*cRiNgE*
who here just to dislike
Yo the dislikes are gone pass the likes
I love this song better then the London one
Who had the better ghost writer Jake Paul or ricecum
1:32 When you're 5 years old doing that "I just pooped" dance in front of your mom.

luisito comunica
Compared to Fresh outta London this is fucking trash in my opinion just saying
Who wants him to do a song with eminem
Jake has evolved a lot with his music over the years
all these ksi fanboys gosh
Let’s be real we only clicked on the vid to dislike it
Ksi better
With each subscription, I will write your "nicknames"
2020 is a joke
I listened this song 100 fuckin times and still counting...
Jake paul made 23% of the song
the music video super cringe, the songs aight but it's obvious he has a ghost writer and the song would be better with literally anyone else singing it
Fire 💯💥
definitely has a ghost writer
the only good '' jake paul '' song 🤫
Is it just me or does this remind you of 'Did it again' by lil tecca?
this aint bad but he  has a ghost writer
Songs are starting to sound the same
Sociopath
I want to get one notification because of my comment
Thing is these 2 last tracks have actually been fire and have done the job of getting stuck in my head. Also realised every line on this track is 1 rhyme scheme, if his next one is anything like this and Fresh Outta London jakes gonna rise in them Spotify plays... Jus sayin xD
No cap he be snappping on his new music I like dis jack Paul yessir
Bro legit, you can’t sing
When has Jake Paul ever made a hit song?
Who wrote his song?
Dammm thats  fire
England is my city xddd                  Never forget
You know how in the start he said Joey maybe that’s his ghostwriter cause he also said that in fresh outa London
I feel a disturbance in the force, I sense        Ghost writer

This feels excalty like fresh outta london.

Jake Paul is basically if my dogs 12 foot long turds could talk.

Money we helped him make
This song isn’t bad🔥.                (ON MUTE)
If you turn it up all the way with head phones so cool
till this day you still haunt me-
;-;
bad song
Jakey can only record songs as long as pp.
Fun fact : people will never forget the words "England isn't a city"   Lol.
I wonder who wrote this one
The 1% who is reading this...May your Mom,dad live more than 100 years
Shut
Ngl imo jake paul can rap wayy better than ksi
OMG this is fucking fire
Cold
Jake is starting to be really likeable ❤️
Jake Paul acting like that “23 sitting on 23” bar isn’t from a Drake song in 2011
It definitely is an improvement tho ngl, actually sounds like rap.
This song hits different on mute
Sick song!!!!!!!!! But its as sad because u never wrote it
Why do I like this
The only bar for bar he was going for was the bars he was counting in his prison cell
Can really see the bar for bar coming through
🔥 song bro 🔥👑🔥
I reported this for burning money as it’s illegal
think most of us can agree this song woud be so much better if jake didt sing in it , ghost wirter you need to stand up for youself and leav this guy
Sounds the same as straight out of London
Jake Paul got a voice for it sure but the ghost writer wrote everything and just made this song for him
On mute this music his better
Jake kinda looks like Cabeza de Vaca no joke
I mean just look at his. dislikes
Bruh must have eaten the Travis Scott burger
Why is jake mimicking jj i mean first  the disa tracks then boxing however he was called out now coming out with music for no reason. I can already see jacks next song still being about money girls again again
This song is actually really good he has a good flow now
Damn he flexing
yeah this has more views than Loose...... so?
I'm bored
i thought this song was good dude. i was vibing pretty hard with it
This is the best song he ever made by far keep it up bro👍👍👍
Good song , but at the beginning there is literally JJJOE who the f is that.
When the next song after Jake Pauls is Loose from KSI
Was dissapointed at first that the song was short, but this song slaps and is one of my new favs
CURRY AND CREAM PODCAST OUT NOW !!!!!
😂😂😂 it says jake Paul made another hit song in ur dreams 😂😂😂😂
It’s a ok song it’s a shame u didn’t write it  tho
Spark that weed up for all your 9 yo fans. Clown
Bro dis song makes me vibe at school no cap
"KSI's songs keep getting worse" Did anyone else notice?
omgg yas jakeee
Shits fire
The only problem with this song is that it starts.
Jake Paul must have eaten those new Travis Scott burgers 😂
This is brutally bad
Why does he want to be black so bad
Sounds just like every other song lately. Doesn't mean its good, but honestly if I heard this I'd assume its any modern day "musician" in the charts.
another ghost written song i reckon?
Bruh no there’s no way. There’s no way Jake went from MY TEACHER NEVER TAUGHT ME THAT to this and Fresh Outta London. How many ghostwriters does this man have?! Like both this and Fresh slap. You know what gg Jake, gg...
Why he buss folks😂 1:00
Trash
Hes still relevant?
This song is amazing I literally love it so much I have it on repeat and I already streamed it it’s amazing
Here before it reach a million dislike
This song hits different on mute
Never new Jake Paul smoked this song is actually quite hard though thanks to ghost writers
It's better on mute
I am the only one who is starting to like his new songs?
Lol he did a ricegum and pinned the only good comment
Anybody come here just to dislike it
Honestly I was bopping for a minute
Only thing to look forward to with these songs is jj's reaction
🔥 Jake’s music came a long way
Bar for bar again?
Auto tone helps a lot of you new “rappers” “singers” such a joke.
Who’s in 2041 jake in jali in New York for 12 years sad :(
It’s funny how people just hating cause it’s jake Paul but if it was any other rapper rapping this they would call it a hit 🤔
Best song ever
He's like 6ix9ine
Vibe! 💪🏼
In the comments its just this song hit different on mute which it does
lmao he doing 10 mil on youtube, but only 600k on spotify, that how you know he trash 😂
10/10, I love jake’s new ghost writer.
No fucking way he went from “It’s everyday bro with the Disney channel flow” to this without a ghost writer fuck that
Lol I’m 30 sittin on $30k!! It’s ok that’s still lit
ok so we all gonna settle on that he didnt write it, cause Jakes vocabulary is limited to only 3 words ITS EVERYDAY BRO
First 6 seconds of the vid is good the rest isn’t
If drake did this i would be all over it
His ghost writer is actually ok
9.5 million people r from ksi
imagine liking jake paul, it's his ghostwriter we should give love it
Jake aint write this lol, he makes it look good tho lol
would like to see his ghost writer acctually sing this
Jake start making videos you haven't done none since August
BUT DID HE WRITE IT THO?
Imagine he actually wrote it we'd all look dumb asf
There's no way he write the song
What the fuck was that intro
1:32 He tried to do that one dance move.
when i actually consider dis dude as an artist bc of his 2 new songs
It's the drip for me.
Zlatý bažant 73 je lepšie jak toto pivovin

Bro! straight UP! QUIT YOUTUBE AND RAP. ONLY RAP. idc what anyone says. Haters know this is fire. If you werent jake Paul this would be the fall bop. 100 bro
jake did u write it tho
I’m I the only one who watch this 10 btw u r killing it jake😎😎😎😎
Im gonna pretend this is from a different artist becoz i m JJs fan and i can't listen to jakes song but this song is cold i cant 🧢
This guy really deleted the comment that says this song hits different on mute 🤐💀
His ghost writer is at it again
When Jake admits he has a ghost writer I'll like his songs
this song is litttt
Every song sounds the same though
Are his songs inspired by vine ? Short? 2 minute songs aren't songs man. Comon, put some more effort, why cut it short when you can go all the way? People make distracks longer than this. This is just laziness.
Jake Paul is going to brazil.
Good song
If Jordan ever saw this he’d sue for defacing his brand lol
Ur ghost writer is actually mad uno
way better than "outta London" pog
his music is as bad as the video
jake paul going to be a XXL freshmen
Ghost writer ?
I understand that people will dislike it because of the whole ghost writer scenario. But honestly, he raps fine, but still there no groove and idk what is up with songs being 2 minutes in length, like, thats barely when one starts grooving and as soon as you kind of start to groove, the song ends. Laziness maybe, since they already put effort to make it two minutes long, they could make it a little longer especially when they repeat that one verse 10 times anyway
Uhhhhhhhhh he didn't write this!!!
this song is actually good
The dislikes 🤣🤣🤣
Who came here to dislike the video and leave
Bloody hell...The Ghostwriter really went off, better give him a raise!...💀💀💀
Claim your "Here before Jake denies he has a blatantly obvious ghostwriter and then accidentally reveals that he does" Ticket
Really should just rename this fresh outta london, straight to the prison shower's
Jake flexing that he is rich... Me beast: Are you challenging me

My reaction in one word “nah”
There is no way jake wrote the lyrics
Tbh idk this song but too me this dnt hit like other songs being real

On the real this ain’t bad.
This is a spin-off of Coco melon.
Simply put, this is fire but Jake Paul is still a bad person and is using a ghost writer.
This is fire 🔥
people would have respected his music way more if he just admitted to having a ghost writer from the jump
Oo look at this bad ass smoking a blunt
Anyone remember Miley Cyrus 23
No    Thats the comment
who wrothe this for u
He just had to make a song to make 2020 even worse. :/
And their still flexin with backflips...
to his haters. The man had 3 years to perfect his craft, and learn real music. But yall still find a way to invalidate his hard work. Smh.
Imagine subscribing to jake Paul and buying his merch 😂

JJ is smiling for the content that jake is giving him for the price of $0
Short
"Kill jasper" is on the writers list, Jake is too, but he just signed the paper
I like the songs but just want to know that if he wrote it by himself
1:20 is jake paul donating to blm how nice
Who else came to dislike
Someone said when the white kid eat the travis Scott meal hold up😂😂😂😂😂
My guy really pinned the only comment that said the song was good. Fair play, dickhead.
I only watched this to let my fists fantasize about punching
JAKE PAUL DID WRITE THE SONG!!!     Nvm he didn’t
Is it just just me or this man making fire songs now
why are jakes songs hitting different this year
Choose a career YouTube star or a rapper🤣😂
Fun fact: Ghostwriters made 90% of the song, Jake Paul made 10%.    Disappointing.
No
This slaps on mute 🔥
Wonder how much he payed a ghost writer for only 2 min worth of music
We can’t compare jake Paul to ksi Jake Paul got 10m views on his most recent songs without a feature and ksi only gets views when he has a big feature.
🤔there’s a song called 23 already
I had a really good but crazy dream about jake the other night lmao
Is it just me or is everyone starting to like  Jakes music again? This is 🔥 same with fresh outta London, there both sick!
DAAM CASPER DID A GOOD JOBB 👍 🦸‍♂️
Miley Cyrus did it better
Oh yeah I had a party without masks, raided a mall, showed a corpse on camera and I have an enormous ego. Wonder why I have so many haters.
Nah he actually snapped on this.
KSI fans keep pressing that unlike button😂😂😂
The guy should’ve been a long time ago IMO.

On january 23 this song will be irrelevant
I love how he’s such a wannabe. Should’ve been banned long ago imo
U know jake didn't write this
Ok guys just leave a dislike and save ur ears
Idk anymore
Hang on, didnt this guy become a famous YouTube, then a boxer, now he's a rapper? Seems a tad delusional.
He didnt write this its obvious
The reason this guy has more than 10 mil views, is the same reason as why people listened to WAP on YouTube
Jake should of stayed away from YouTube or retire
Damn Jake Paul Made Another Hit Song Ayyyyyy
Ksi punching the air rn
Look jake paul isn't my fav but this music holyyyyy
This is better than all of ksi's songs put together
Bro isn’t this like a different verse to the last song

Ngl. Jake isn’t the best person out there. But this is fire
Goddamn this ghost writer is pretty good. Tag him jake, unless u scared of ghosts 😱

Wow
Enjoy the time you have before you get slapped up by KSI 😂
Yall stop hatin dababy has the same flow on almost every song soo stfu haters🤦 and other rappers has ghost writers
oh no another everyday rap song flexing money ...   anyways
Another track thats actually decent since he’s starting fresh
Who’s better at rapping   Ghost writers  Or  Jake Paul
I love you vides
yo why is this dude in trending he stopped being relevant before he was born
This comment can have 100 likes only
This is disrespectful to MJ
This is probably my favorite song by Jake its real catchy👍
Good song but probably ghostwrited
How sad.  Next time you watch him od. Since when he became a rapper?
when he trys to dace jokes
Nice ghostwriter bud
When jake actually hires a writer instead of doing it himself
Who is a better rapper ksi   Subscribe: for ksi Like: for jake paul
is sad u have to take another title to make it yours
I know you won’t see this Jake, but get iamrealak way more famous. He deserves it.
FIRE
Is it just me or a smell smoke and a see flames
Now that he has people making lyrics for him, It's now decent
._.
Good job jake
Your music is actually cancerous
Anyone else just come here to dislike his music videos no matter how good they are  in honour of  “ everyday bro “
Would you rather listen to...  Its Every Day Bro  or.  23    (Me personally its every day bro)
How do I dislike twice?
Mgk? That you?
If you wrote this it would be very surprising
Trash. Why is he still famous? Go use your skills/capabilities elsewhere
All the ksi fans just come here to dislike🤣🖕
My deaf uncle loves this song
It’s a shame they didn’t fall off that roof.
The beat is dope.
What the hell was the skit in the beginning for anyway? It didn’t add anything whatsoever. Funny as.
When white kids eat the Travis Scott meal:
Y’all know if u are hating u guys are just giving Jake the king views right
This song I do trash
Hey I know how old you are your 23
Aight but lets check his monthly listeners
I like em two at a time, I feel like Jordan back in my prime, I really should have died along with Vine
Oh I’m jake I smoke i think I’m so cool
I dare u to buy a kc  football team kc chifes ok hommie
Who else came to dislike
Look at those dislikes
No
This beat eat
Maaaan ts TRAAAASH
trash
I despise Jake but I this song is actually pretty good
Damn... I can't believe people are sleeping in this, this is so fire 🔥🔥  Edit: I just finished watching the first 30 seconds and I'm already tired of it, tf is this garbage
I like how there is so many haters and Jake is just making fun of them and there still here listening and reading and liking comments which just helps Jake so thanks guys. Another good song Jake keep going u still got fans
If ksi hates this he doesn't have any experience in music
8mill views since yesterday?? Why he buying view lmaoo if only you could buy Spotify listeners🤣🤣
Who’s Jake Paul ?
I love this song best one on YouTube
This is so bad.
Next thing you know KSI fans will be claiming that Jake didn’t even sing the song.
U gotta stop man ur stealing their culture
I’m hip this his songs are r sum bumps
Rather wipe my arse with sand paper than listen to this ever again
🔥 🔥
The beat is hot, but I can't get past his douche-ness
Your prime making vids for 10 year olds
Everyday bro is better
It’s funny how the weed doesn’t make him realize how fn lame he is
I wonder who his ghost writer is this time
Omg this is so good muted
This song is good seen Jake Paul made it
Ain't sure if he'll be a better freestyle rapper... but since he always claims he writes his shii himself then what about doing a love freestyle? Lol
The funny thing is that someone else wrote this
Better than ksi
3rd eye woken?
shii fye bruh keep doin whatchu doin
Geez man this shits fire. WTF! JAKE EVOLVED LIKE CRAZY. HE LOOKS SO DAMN AUTHENTIC  NOW
Go back to vloging😂
This is actually fire 🔥
Ghost writer?
I guess he liked the seats that recline
Oooooooomg
sad potato (u suck)
The ghost riders go crazyyyyyy.
if he this is ghost written then jake should fire him
Jake Paul is the type of person who would date a girl with an identical twin sister and say he wouldn’t the sister cause she’s ugly.
This song hits different when ur 6 feet under
Fair enough
so.. was this song meant for his main demographic because this doesn’t look too appropriate for 9 year olds.
Who is Jake Paul?
Weren't you arrested or something?
Ghost writer alert!!!!!!! 😱😱
Good song if it wasn’t sung by Jake Paul
Shii ass🤦🏻‍♂️
Ngl this this fire
Let's check his monthly listeners
💩
trash
Idk if Jake knows this but every car has seats that recline......
Pleasantly surprised 🤷🏾
This is gross
Wtf isn’t this the idiot that did vines?
Bro anyone who says Jake Paul didn't write this song is stupid. Dab on the haters. It's everyday bro!! Jake pauper for life.      Got you there didn't I? Jake "ghostwriters" Paul
Is that real money?
Jake paul lasts in bed as long as this song
so bad
If you’re reading this “YOU GOTTA FRIEND IN ME!” 🤠👍🏽
For every $100 shown in this video, there’s one ghostwriter.
Comments are better than this trash
This aint it
This is SO good       When it’s in mute
You killed I’m sueing you
Its funny because this is definitely ghost written and still terrible.
Da baby vibes?
Here just to dislike squad ?
I like this new jake paul
Sittin' on 23 -tha dogg pound
Is it me or are all his songs the same kind noe
Interviewer: so Jake did u write it  Jake:Yea yea me and my friend wrote it  Interviewer:Wha...  Jake:U want money?
Unimportant opinion: why is this trending?
This is obviously written by a ghost writer, you can't go from Its everyday bro to songs that sound like desiigner wrote it
Bro this song isn't even that bad
Car drives off  Jake: *opens WhatsApp to look for lyrics*
How much paying him JP? 👻👻👻✍✍✍
Jake Paul gives the dislike button a purpose
When you’re trying to hard to get into XXL
Is he even a Michel Jordan fan does he even know how many rings he has
Where did Jake rent the maybach from?
Great song! and it's so catchy. Also, I'm a new artist and would be so very honored for everyone to take a minute to check out my music. Thanks so much guys!
lol ok but can we go back to disney
His voice isn’t good
Whoever wrote this should have been paid more.
You can’t rap Disney boy
He’s got two good verses but then he just copied paste the chorus and ended it 😂
who wrote this one
Low key 🔥
This song is so bad that it makes me want to kill myself.
The song isn’t bad but something is off
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤧🤧🤧😷😷😷😷😷😷 lol yuck
It’s still trash but it’s better then it’s everyday bro
Is he high😂🤣
when you try to be polo g
Did he write it?
Idc if there’s ghosts writers this hard
came to see the like to dislike racio
He sounds like hes holding milk in the bottom of his mouth while he raps, trying to make sure it doesnt spill out
👇 everyone who agrees jake’s a douche
Gee where are my eyes and ears oh yeah they melted while listening to this
The last song was better. The hook is weak on this one.
Jake Paul has upgraded so much!
Hold on this kinda fire?!
No wonder he went looting. He needed an outfit for the music video
I thought this was the best song he has released. But then I realised my phone was on mute
When you just watched "The Last Dance" with your ghost writer
WHO WROTE THIS WTF?!?!
My fbi Agent wounding who wrote this
Banger
2 words: ghost writer
Did he actually right this in his own or got a ghost writer like straight outta londen
Honestly the beat hit hard but the lyrics kinda cringy
🤮🤮🤮🤮
I was listening to this on 1.25x by accident and I was like oh he got better. And thennnnn. The song is pretty dec in terms of pop rappers tho.
Thought this guy said he’d quit YouTube. Wish that included posting music on here as well
Jake = Eric Cartman. And you know it.
This man just disrespected Jordan  for wearing that bulls outfit lmfao
this was somehow really good
This song is fire 🔥                    No really this song makes you wanna burn to death
🐰💛this song hits different with s music video!!!!!🙈:-(
I Think that y’all should get back to care that you and Erica
Wasnt this man married
Why did YouTube recommend this trash!
Awhhhhh fuck, who wrote it this time jake?
Well Well,  another song another bangar? another ghost writer
Bruh I wanna hop on a song with Jake so bad
Where the “JaKe pAulErS” but honestly the song ain’t that bad
He hurt thoes twins so bad and though it was funny
Mikey cyrus knock off
Bro I finna raid Jake Paul house to find his ghost rider
Fuckin fire
Sounds the same as the last song...
Ngl this pretty fire bro 🔥 😂
Keep putting bangers like this so we can feel better with this so called “2020”
You’re right jake Paul can’t make a good song, but his ghost writer can
He titled the song on how many ghost writers he had to use to write this
I now wish I wasn't born on the 23rd.
MGK really took a break from his own music and gave it to Jake
The way he said "No Cap" it's a no for me he's trying to hard.
This makes me want to be deaf.
I never knew you could rap so damm good!
Fun fact: the title is the amount of minutes it takes Jake Paul to get to the bank in order to get the money he owes his ghost writer
I would say that jake pual has musically upgraded but he prolly stole the lyrics for this too😭😭😭😭
my ears are bleeding lmao his flow is so dead and his voice pisses me off😭
Jake paul, you've changed...
people who think he is making good music are definitely either 9 or trump supporters
I hope you paying your ghost writer good
When will you learn you no one likes you
He can't rap im sorry
I thought you were done with youtube
PewDiePie reaction is next.
This song hits different with my phone in a sound proof room with locked doors for a full year
This song is going to blow up
Probably written by his Ghost writer or should I say his friend who goes bar for bar
Damn I wish killjasper made his own music
The I’m a huge KSI fan and ngl that beat slapped. The rest of the song was ehh
Tbh I rather listen to 6ix9ine
🔥🔥mad
Low key Jake keeps making songs like this i might have to become a Fan.  This is Damn Good
Trash
ROFL 🤣 THIS SONG IS POOOOOOOOOOOO SO SHITTTTTTRRRTTTTTTTTTT LMFAO LuL
First-person to reply to this is gao
i wonder who wrote this now
k, we can all agree the Jake Paul is a drug lord.
This is disrespectful to MIKEWILLMADEIT, Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa, and Juicy J. They made a much better song called 23
His 10 year old fans are very confused right now
Zero talent!!
Horrible!!
This is fire     On mute
Ngl this sounds great
Why do i give this man views. Should have never clicked
This shi pretty lit for real lol
This song hits different on mute
All these ghost writer jokes are funny as hell 🤣😂🤣. This is actually pretty dope I give Jake props just hope his ghost writer doesn't get jelious.🤣😂🤣😂
alright who tf is the ghostwriter
Ey this kinda sick man good job
🤣🤣, weak bars 😁👌
Damn It's actually a really good song.
Keep it up bro blessings
"Accused of ghost writers" nah it's so garbage we know it's just him
Jake is a one hit wonder
🤣
Trashhhhhhhhhh

Who wants to like his songs but just hates Jake Paul to much
Jake getting better this shi Fire

💥🔥2⃣3⃣🔥

When was Jake ever in his prime he was always hated
🤢🤢🤮
Who wrote the lyrics though 😂
Bro jake Paul need to get signed on the quicks 😭 keep working hard jake I fw this new u
Ghostwriter popped off on this
there is no fucking way he doesn't have a ghostwriter
He smoker?
Damn🔥🔥🔥
let’s make this vid age restricted so it has less likes
Sounds exactly the same as the last one
1:49 Jake Paul makes even more trash and people now know he has ghost writers
My guy fr said he made another hit song 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice ghost writer who wrote it was it your dad
your actually good at rapping ever since your"fresh outta londan song" wow now that you made another good song i feel like you got this keep making fire songs
Fun Fact:Jake Didnt Right This Himself
His voice is just shut
Whos better? Like: ksi  Leave this comment alone: jake paul
Ghost writer
damn desiigner went hard with this one
He disrespecting Jordan by comparing himself 2 him
This guy way to White to wear a 23 bulls Jersey and say i feel like Jordan
Jake Paul putting out HITS
Another bad song JAKE  u cant do music idiot
Great Acting
Garbage
Just like a smokescreen
YouTube Jay Skreetz It’s Nothing

Omg this lit
Pake jaul.

Pale jaul.
Pake jaul.
Who is your ghost rider
Ghostwriter
Why has Jake Paul acting gone from good to trash
I love you
Didn't he get caught for trafficking girls tho?
Finna report this for harmful content so youtube has to go through cancer like disease
I’ve with Jake since 10k subscribers on this channel we’ve grown 🤧 were growing fast
The song is cool
Anyone can write a song where you repeat the same lyrics 20 times and then say you wrote a song without a ghost writer
Jake the new ricegum/DAX                                      Irrelevant
A let’s go a new ghost rider ( :
Waiting for KSI to react to this ...

Bruh he stole a bar from tobi😂
Aren’t you wanted by the police?💀

„We went bar for bar“  Ghostwriter‘s line  : She go and she fuck up the vibe, I feel like jordan I‘m back in my prime“   Jake’s line : Yes  thats lit give me another bar
Best song jake paul on demon time
W

GHOST WRITER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Trash
ksi > jake paul
He’d get killed in Manchester on his ones 🚫🧢pussy
What is the black and hispanic dude doing? Why are they flexing with their hands in the sky like chicken trying to fly?
This sounds brilliant      I’m deaf btw 🤝 🤲 🙌🤙👉🤚

Ksi’s new song is better
my grandpa has been crippled for 20 years... today he got up to shut this off

It’s good ngl.
On 26 seconds look down is that a dilldo
stop hating yk it’s actually good
who wrote this one
This guy back or what???
I didn’t wanna get him a view but anybody that reacts always pauses and I can’t see every second
Jake gets a lot of views than jj cuz he premieres his music videos whereas jj doesnt.
jake paid his ghostwriter a lot of money
His ghost writer goin crazy
How much he paying his ghostwriter
Damn nice ghost writers
please understand your fame is wearing off and only a couple of people want to listen to your music
Its has the exact same beat as his last song 🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
He doesn’t write them
what a lot of utter shite
One question, did his ghost writer disappear?
Like the song but still gotta dislike the vid
the song is mega extra loud but I would like it to be louder than I am Romanian
why did he come back
This song is actually good when is on mute
Definitely got a ghost writer
KSI fan here with my dislike  KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI
Jake I loved u till 2017 and I love your new songs
This is actually good 😐
Why does he have a beard
Why are yall saying he has a ghostwriter we cant even see him
I'll only download his music when he features his ghost writer
I’m a KSI fan but I gotta admit his new flow and style is catchy 😂
Still listening
Why jake look like he say the n word
Good beat
Jake did you write the song??
Mumble rap really opened the floodgates
The tradey's of 2020: -Australian Bush fires -Corona virus - Floods - Jake Paul making ok music
Think this is my new favourite song. Keep going Jake 🤩😍
what a douche
He definitely got writers
The only thing nice about this song is the like to dislike ratio bar.
Jake paul    Lemme see how many likes this gets cause other stupid stuff does
who the ghost writer
I feel like if Jake Paul just admits that he has a ghost writer people would start appreciating him.
SCHMUTZ
Ion like Jake Paul or ksi but I gotta admit Jake finally making quality music like ksi . This is actually better than most ksi songs tbh
ITS BEEN 4 DAYS AND ITS STILL ON TRENDING UAHAHAHAHAHA
Did you write this one?
T fue...?
This song decent the only question is if he did write it?
This song is so bad awha
Keep eyes on the headline  It says ksi songs keep getting worse 😂
came here just to press the dislike button nice and hard with passion
I am ksi fan jake paul🖕
Proof he has a ghostwriter      He made 2 banging songs in 1 month its jake paul hes trash
Yo who's your ghost writer
Jake buys views to be better than ksi cause I checked 2-4 hours ago it was at 1.1 million views now it at 8.9 million views 😅 Jake is so stupid
Jake paul doing it big with music
I can't be the only person that just goes to Jake's music videos and dislikes them 🤣🤣🤣
Yep....hes 2 for 2
Let's give his ghost Wrighter a massive applause he definitely should get a pay rise. Why does Jake Paul wreck the whole song by just being in it
Dude the song is lite
Y is joke acting bad ??
Jake paul has so much talent!    He found his perfect ghostwriter😃
He still claims he’s made a hit🤦‍♂️
I like this one, butt the vid is a little werid
the beat is kinda the same as the last but this 33 year ol mumma from nz likes it lol
Why is this song better on mute
Very well done jake
When is the next boxing match bro?
This hard but he cant say its better than ksi's music but it okay i guess it the vibe is nice
trash 🗑
This is actually good :0
What’s jakes ghost writers name?
This is shite
Can 2020 get any worse 😆 Yep
The most unlikely source for bangers this year, i ain't complaining tho 🔥
Suburban kids hyped af right now
I like the seats that recline   Pewdiepie : but can it do thi—              OH
Did u write this one fatty?
Ugh
1:48 "Haters"
23+23+23 is 69 jake Paul is atleast good in number.
I like how y’all talk so much shii
Whos here before 10mil views?
Trash
It’s funny how Jake copied Logan’s beard  but can’t copy his personality
new hit song
as the famous KSI said, “Fresh Outta London V2”.
Bro his songs actually guud?
Jake. Do me a favour. Please  Quit  YouTube   For   The  Love  Of  God
This song good can’t cap
Cool ghost writer tho
Why does this have a fresh outta London vibe
Here before jj reacts to it
I like the nothing
There is no way this dude wrote this song it’s to good to come out of his garbage last 2 brain cells 😂😂😂
Your so dog pooo🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
This is absolute ass
Only if this was call 24 he would have guessed the future.
Last song was good this is just straight ASS
JAKE PAUL WOKE UP TODAY PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same beat as last song  still has ghost writer
Jake Paul even beat your favorite rapper in views.... sad that the music industry is letting ghost writers take over now.
Unpopular opinion: Jake delivery is better than Ksi
I think this is better than his old song
His ghostwriter be hitting different
all these jake fanboys, y’all got me dying of laughter
Do your parents react to your song
Same garbage flow desiigner and the other dude gave him
Ksi watching this like:👁👄👁
For one time this is fire
Nah, this ain't it...
Wow the dislikes are competing
His enunciation is awful
Jake why did the money change you
It’s so clear he didn’t write this
Jake Paul is the type of person that does something really bad and is confused to why everyone hates him afterwards
Why do all of his songs sound the same exactly why he cant be a good musician
this is the new rap song everybody will be talking about
So he smokes now?
Thus song is actually  a banger
Jake gonna say he got more views than JJ but honestly 99% of people are here to dislike, including me 😂
Ghostwritten songs
Imagine flexing  while owning the IRS over 2 million dollars 🤧 sad
L
He still trying to rap? 🤦🏾‍♀️
This isnt bad
6ix9ine is better
This song go hard and the fact that haters watch the video just to criticize......wow go get a life
You hit the Stoned man😘
Thh hbu is is mad 🔥
💯
this makes me wonder why hes verified
why did he show his ghost writer again
came here to unlike
Y’all just mad it go hard
The best part about the song is the part where he stops singing.
This is lit
why is this actually good ?
I thought jake paul was already trash how can he be worse than before like if u agree
Who’s your ghost writer they must be good
Yooo headphones make this song sound so much better when someone else wears them
I'm feeling the same flow from fresh out of London
I think your house should be searched for being an idiot and you should have got arested and be considered a convicted felon
Is he tired already of his new style?
This song flow sounds identical to some other rappers I heard before, just can’t put my finger on it 🤨
This honestly worse than mumble rapping.
It fire 🔥
#23 on trending AHmm
Y'all are actually stupid  Someone's succeeding you out here hating lol
No fucking way he wrote this
desgllner
Put it on 2x speed, it doesn’t make it better but it ends quickly
Look at all the haters actually punching the air because he made a good song
I wanted to listen to this, so I would know if it is actually good, but well I turned it of after 20 seconds
Hello
Idc what anyone says his song is good y’all hatin lol
this song is hitting hard
The song isn't bad, but two things: A) It's definitely ghost-written.  It's the exact same style as the other song, which was ghost-written.   B) The headlines are obnoxious.  Sure, "Jake Paul woke up today, people are outraged," is kinda funny, but this guy still doesn't realize that the things he does are bad  "Oh, I looted from a mall, lied about it, then had charges pressed against me, yeah, but my haters are punching the air!"
😂
The song is terrible🤣🤣
Jake Paul makes 🔥 music now
how much you pay desiigner ? i want him
Like the song but I want the old Jake back:/
I love it
This dude starting smoking? How u gon box with sorry ass stamina
U haven't wrote this
Yo this is the number of people think jake didn't write this ⬇️
Tbf it’s good but did he make it no sooooo ffs

The best part about this song is that it only last like 1:40
0:37 Dax before rapping
He’s so wack lol it’s someone else’s song 🤦🏼‍♀️
I’m a KSI fan but this was fye 🔥 I’m impressed
Ngl i may be a ksi fan but this is heat yall cant lie 🔥🔥

naa jake stop it this song slaps but bro u never wrote this
I’m disappointed that there was no FBI feature
The style of the song is overused and it’s just sounds very walmart version of that type music fam like it doesn’t feel right 0/10 for effort
trap drums and basic beat and he thinks he has talent.
This song hits different when you cut your ears off
Very good turkey 🇹🇷. Hello

Welp am I the only who forgot about jake Paul for a couple years then see he posted a new song and decides to see it then the memories of his first song are back 6mill on YouTube in six months never done before ayyy
The whip is way better than the music video including the lyric
2:06 *_The part you have been waiting for_*
Who's jake paul's ghostwriter
How about he stops doing music videos and start vloging again
OKAY
this slaps HARDER than fresh outta london
Yo who else clicked on this just to dislike
fresh out of london still better no cap
His ghost writter is really good.....
When I looked at the song title I thought that’s how many ghostwriters he had
Someone give him some crumpets
Imagine having to pay your black friends to be in a video with you..😆
He wants to be black so bad

And all the videos you have done has made me laughed I was watching your videos over 5 years I love bye
This guy went from one of the whitest dudes in America to this B.S 😡😡

Trash bro stick to youtube videos
I wouldn't know what do without you i would cry if you died and I I will kill myself too your so much to me I  love you  be safe bye oh and one more I hope I can meet you bye 😀💪
I thought Jake Paul quits Youtube
Yeah the song is good, but he overused the hook and his verse is the same flow and melody. It’s a good song with a good beat. But his verse was just a basic rappers flow.
He should make a song with amaru cloud that would be a nice song because they sound alike
If this song was made by a different person I would like it
my destiny just for dislike...
Dope song Jake!
Bruhh try putting your phone on mute the song would hit diffrent
I'm a bigger hater on these YouTube guys but this song is dope. Jake Paul cold.
This song is good but is it weird that I can’t enjoy it because it’s this guy?
Gay!!

Anyone else miss the old jake Paul from 2-3 years ago when we heard I. The beginning of the video “Ha ha”
For those who think jake is a better artist than ksi, ur braindead. ksi writes his own music and jake doesn’t so ksi’s a better artist and he keeps making hits
I’ll admit I can vibe to this tune but KSI’s recent music is still better.
😭😭😭😭😭😢 I just want subscribers
Ho dusk
This song hits different on mute
Anyone listening to this on mute..... in 2020????

My grandma was always in a wheelchair and today she stood up to turn your music off.
Jake Paul sounds so weird saying, “NO 🧢” or is that just me?

2 minutes? Damn, soon tunes will only be 60 seconds and have just a chorus being repeated over and over again.
No offence but whenever white people try to rap/speak in slang it's always soooo awkward. His pronouncation is bad.

Jake Paul: why? because change is scary
Is that the money for the taxes?
This song is like only 2 verses bruh
Drugs really hit him hard
This low-key slaps more than all his previous songs. Growth.
Why do I like this
U admitted that you have a ghost writer
At least he never threw a party this time
Completely random fact:  90% of the world’s population lives in the Northern Hemisphere.
when you order DaBaby's flow on amazon[2]

If you got on Spotify to see the song credits where it says: written by, it legit says -  So who was the ghost writer jake
Brilliant video mate
I would've thought you gave up on this a long time ago, all your songs get an immense amount of dislikes, I'd have given up by now lol
Never liked this guy, but the song is fire ngl
Claim your “here before 10 million views” ticket here

Jake really is the type of person to see other YouTube rappers and try to do the same thing as them except have someone write it for him
look at desiigner making a comeback, so insparational.
The best thing about this video is Logan’s cameo, I actually like him a little more now lmao
Even when Jake has ghost writers he can’t make a song longer than 2 minutes lol
The dislikes dropped harder than my grades.

Alt + f4 to make this song sound even better homie 🥵🥵🥵🥵

Jakes ghost writer thinking of robbing Jakes house 😂
Cultural appropriation in its lowest form

I'm I the only one out of two who's starting to like these new songs ?
Yo nice lyrics *Desiigner*
The song is actually good but I can't accept that.
This stuff is so meaningless - people used to make serious art and now they create this
The title is the amount of people he’s had so far to write his songs for him
Hey ain’t gonna lie, he’s getting better 👌 this is good but my fav has been YT’er diss track
This hits different on mute 😔👊
Your a child Entertainer if u haven’t noticed

Cool song jake
Other youtuber: what's the worst feeling ever? Me: hmmmmm that's a good question!  2 days later   Me: (sees jake Paul video in recommended)
Ngl I'm just here to dislike the song🤷🏻‍♂️
Dope

Reminds me of rapper " Tremendous Repeat" played by Chris Rock.
Great! Hero!
Yo why is this lowkey a hit 🤣

forget the past just focus on the present
I bet everyone here just scrolling down the comments
Who came here to see dislike ?
No.
pathetic
I just came to dislike out of habit.
I just realised Jake Paul will never be liked
This song would be better if I just popped my eardrums real quick
This is alright. Maybe a few more tracks and some more experience. Keep up the good work.
Fun fact: the title is the amount of money Jake pays his ghost writer an hour
When did jake start doing weed
I mean. It is fire I cant really dis the song itself. It was co-writtin so Jake at least put in some work for the lyrics.  Hes gettin better. Does it mean I like him as a person? No. But its still a good song.
Props to producer tho 👏 hardddd beat🥶
Decent song better than everyday bro
He didn’t write this
wow
This is good
Am I the only one watching this on mute?
Glad to see he still got that flog camer in his arm

Honestly bad I cannot even hear what he is saying 🤣
Is no one going to talk about how his face glitches at 0:53
This song slapsssss no cap 💯

Soulja boy voice: “JAAAAAAAAKE? JAKE?”
The truth is that every song that Jake Paul makes will suck ass.
I know he’s jake Paul but his bars can’t be his
So many dislike man
This boy still putting fakeass vevo in the title
I puked after watching this and then my cousin shot himself?
How much Monopoly money is there??????? Ksi rules
Jakes music is in fire now
*Like if you think this video will get more dislikes than likes*  *Comment if you think the likes will stay ahead of the dislikes*       I think it will get more dislikes regardless of what JJ or any other YouTuber does, the dislikes are currently growing 30% faster than the likes atm it's hard to say it will be an interesting one to say the least, I wonder if it'll get more dislikes than Fresh Outta London.
Another song written my designer sigh*
Finally got a ghost writer eyyy
This was a whole lot of fun to watch I enjoyed it
Imma KSI fan but this song is dope NGL.......
He just said the same sentence the whole song.....

Jesus died for your sins. He loves you and always will love you. When you put your faith in Jesus, you will be saved. If you are ready to accept Jesus, say this prayer Prayer: Lord Jesus, I am ready to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven. I believe that you died on the cross to save me. Jesus, forgive me of my sins and wash away my old life. Let me start a new life with you in Jesus Name. Amen
Could be worse

Came here to dislike and leave
Weak👎
His hair looks like ramen noodles
To be honest his lyrics and voice are really good but the beat kind is lowkey trash
Man, this song would actually chart, and be a hit, if Travis Scott, or someone likeable had sung it, and obviously the only reason it’s decent is because he has a ghost writer
Ngl this is ass just fight KSI already
He definitely ate the Travis Scott burger 🤣🤣
why so many dislikes he finally is sounding alright
All I’m gonna say 👻✏️
I’m from north olmsted bro I fw it
Awesome it’s only 2 minutes
They say jake has fire, while we have lightning
if you happen to come across this comment...         you are loved and appreciated(:
Damn 8m views in 2 days???!?!
Now the thing is this song is good but people's like it's Jake's so u knw😂
I think what people mean by ghost writer isn't just ghost lyric writer, they also mean ghost melody writer, so this isn't even Jake's melody.
Too bad he didn’t write any of these verses! Borrow talent
bro you have changed since the last time i watch you which was in 2017 bro are you ok my man
idc who you is if you think jakes last two songs aren’t better than every ksi song to exist you’re an idiot.
Bruh jake got bars he gonna go harder on his 3 video watch

Ain't this the dude that had a prostitution ring?
Now I think quit vloging and do music forever

Soo this ghost written, and being watched by the feds isn't good
Did he just say “imma hire black people for dis one “
This song sounds the same as his previous one...
the ksi fans are making their way to the dislike button 😂
This is a perfect example of when white men take from black culture, the first word we can use to describe this is: colonization, or appropriation. Stop taking.
Let’s be honest extra sicko mode sauce is what he had on his travi patty
King of new york🤣🤣
me: look its comments sees all the comments say travis scot :O

How much you pay Desiigner to make this one?
I didn’t expect this level of change in you  Ur songs is😘 next level  Love from india❣️
This Song sounds better of mute.
If you have a ghostwriter you can produce some stupid music like this. This guy is nothing. People watch his videos just to dislike. He is nothing in the music industry (he might be good in a youtube point of view). But in music industry he is trash. Straight up trash
Hey Jake my little brother wants you to do a everyday bro song version2 if that is something you want to do
Check out my ✨tunes ✨ if you think more artists should work with female producers
Ain’t no way he wrote this shi💀
Oh, Everyone is Travis Scott now 😂

Sad to see another good beat go to waste im finna put it to good use
UR blunt smoking is worse than this track pmsl
Damn Jake these songs lately have been fire, keep it up
Say hi to your ghostwriter for me
Yo this is straight heattt bro I fucking love this song, it’s so good. Man his lyrics just really hit you know.            Said no one.
Everybody disliked the video before it even started
Ok I’m probably gonna get hated on because some of y’all are sooo sensitive but I gotta say...his music is getting better but I can’t say the same to the intros of the song👽👽😂😂
aren’t you suppose to be arrested or some junk?
you shood just make music
straight outta london but worse at the same time
isn’t this straight outta london cousin?
Shouldn't this whiteboy (who thinks hes better than everybody) be in jail
“hit song” 150000 dislikes within hours , okay bro
Jake Paul’s new music SLAPS
People who put lyrics in the description are weird
I think Steven hawking made more sense talking than this song
Ft. KSI?
"Accusing of Ghostwriters" He literally said it in the podcast
These Millennial Culture vultures man...shits just so weird. Be yourself.
Best part of the song is when it end .....KSI GONNA COME OUT WITH A BANGER
now he should make a song without a ghost writer see how good it is
Damn good song, credits to your ghost writer 🔥🔥
autotune much
Jake looks like that douche bag bully from 17 again but a less intimidating version
Why does this slap
He has a ghost writer
Guys I no longer like Jake Paul! He haunted my Christan Minecraft Server and took a diarrhea dump on the ground and hung the 69 pigs in the house! I am no longer a Jake Pauler. bye bye Jacob
Hogan someone dingdong your door
Jake Paul always rocks👽🖤
Burnaboy boy🙄
Why is he on YouTube
im cant stop watching this music
just a few lines repeated a few times, wonder who wrote this one for him
Take that bull jersey off
Such a disgrace to the 🐐 Michael Jordan 😤
Why do the girls look like they feel awkward
Why im i here
Everything pretty good but the lyrics
The lyrics are still average at best, but his flow has gotten better. Lol
HE PUT THE LYRICS IN THE--------🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴 BRUH🤣
Here’s a free replay button 0:00
Oh my...what have we created...
It’s crazy how bad ppl want to be black, actually it’s sad 🤔
And I'm the only one subscribing to each video I like if you do to like this comment
So this is how its like to have Coronavirus
when dad buys me a new pair of sketchers
Slaps
I'm surprised he actually had more liked than dislikes
This better
Is it really a Jake Paul music video if there isn’t a cringe line at the beginning “no cap” yo but the song bounces though.
That is lettt
Actually fire 🔥
Literally the only word I heard the entire time was 'recline'
Why is this kinda hard tho

The big one might come soon
Who watches this stuff because all the older kids are talking crap about Jake Paul in the comments and kids can’t watch Jake Paul because this is basically the hub soooo (I really hope no kids are watching this stuff
I didn't see him In 4 years since bazardbark show and I decided to watch him know and now I kind of regret it
Should probably just stick to vlogging
His 2 songs are already better than KSI whole music career 😂😂💀
My ears...
Anybody else see "KSI'S songs Keep Getting Worse" at 0:20??    Funny.
So no one's gonna ask who wrote this for him?

People Who Saying This Good      You're Probably Autistic Ngl
Mark 8:36 King James Version 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Music getting repetitive already. Bruh switch it up.

Wasn't everyday bro enough?
Noticed how the flow of these last two songs are almost the same and same style. And how he apparently copied someone else, hmmmm
Fun fact : when you see coins in your room it’s just spiders trying to pay the rent, you should be thankful.

Probably the worst song I've ever heard, why is this even tending ?
That’s just sad, all these people actually disliked just because of who he is💀 like this song is actually pretty good but still gonna get no credit cuz he’s jake 🤦🏽‍♂️
Your career is dead
Why do youtubers think they need to make songs. Like stick to youtube and leave singing up to professionals or people who can actually sing.
He’s so white when he wears that full Jordan gear it looks see through.
Only thing he’ll be good at is starting an only fans that’s it
White people like this are annoying

DID HE WRITE IT THO 🤔
this shits hard
To make this during a pandemic. Seriously? Donate. Help out.
Nice song who wrote it for you ?
wow 23 is a special number
Who wrote this for you
Never see someone with some likes and a lot of dislikes
How does one go from disney to smoking weed?

The fact he lives in la and said feds annoys me
This songs beat will actually go hard in mute
Straight Ass.
Oh, damn!  Jake has talent!  OMG!  I never thought he could rap so well!
People from the uk being salty just to be on ksi’s good side 🤣 his music is straight up trash

Ok mate
Oh no.

Jake's the man
Nice song desiigner
jake paul is a little good but a little suck

Jesus Christ loves y’all! Repent and trust in the Lord our God! <3

Soper  Sperry

When the white boy passes the hood
I’m angry that this song actually got me hype
I agree with all the people who clicked the dislike button.

Garbage and you know it..way to glorify God!
KSI is gonna clap him

Disney Star To Youtube Rapper/Content Creator

You bir in hell
The beginning is so funny
There is nothing original about this.
this is so bad
He think yt views is everything
"ksi songs are still getting worse"
I feel like upchurch should teach this kid a lesson about rapping
So who ghost wrote this? 💀
His Dad really wishing he pulled out now
i'm just waiting to see the dislikes become larger than the likes
this isint bad why does it got so many dislikes ;_;
Roses are red, Violets are blue Jake Paul fans are brain dead And assume they’re cool     If you like jake Paul Please rethink your life :D
Feel sorry for the lyric video makers
I am scared
I wonder who wrote this?
Why isn't autotune credited as a producer?
Everyone hating cause his name is Jake Paul smh
I rather listen to Friday
Cowns
XDDDDS
2:06 click to save brain cells.
...well that SUCKED
*sigh* who wrote it this time?

"This is better than I expected."
this song fire asf!!! 🔥🔥🔥
The song is way to short

White people thinking they hood people now, fame got dem trippin
The song would be better if it had more dislikes
This is garbage.
𝖄𝖔𝖚 𝖔𝖓𝖑𝖞 𝖑𝖎𝖛𝖊 𝖔𝖓𝖈𝖊 𝕺𝖚𝖙 𝖎𝖋 𝖞𝖔𝖚 𝖉𝖔 𝖎𝖙 𝖗𝖎𝖌𝖍𝖙 𝕺𝖓𝖈𝖊 𝖎𝖘 𝖊𝖓𝖔𝖚𝖌𝖍
Man it is ok
👻👻👻👻👻👻
This song hits different bass boosted
😳😳🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wouldn’t be surprised if all the people who say “this slaps” was beforehand smashing their head through a brick repeatedly -.- also, jake, please delete yourself from social media <3
From being a Disney star to getting raided by the FBI, this guy is a man of many talents
thats a lot of dislikes💀💀💀
this song is fcking class
This is straight garbage
Dude looks like Eminem if he hit mid life crisis became an acholic and to gain publicity he started trying the “bad and boogie” life
The bars are nice but i get annoyed cause u fucking use the same bar everytime
Who else is on this video just to give a dislike
I'm in love with you 😍 so much♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💌💌💌💓💓💞💞💝💝💗💗💋💋👰🤵
stop trying to be lilpeep please <3
this songs slaps harder than someone with two amputated arms
Those white kids really think they goin be the next Drake.
I love how at 1:49 in those headlines at the bottom he has “KSI’s songs keep getting worse” despite the fact that KSI’s albums just keep getting better
🗑🗑🗑
His music is getting better
cultural appropriation at its peak lol
when the white kid eats the travis scott burger
Jake Paul defo didn’t write this but he is the guy to say “I’m fucking two at a time”
Big hairy bollocks
🔥🔥🔥
YouTube be like “terminate Leafy for being inappropriate” and then be like “put Jake Paul on the trending page!!!”
You know what, at this point I’m going to start making music
this song is really good                 when you mute it
I wouldn't really call less than 2 minutes of a shitty beat with no original music and shitty rapping a "song"
Jakey making bangerzz  Nahh nah  2020 needs to be biiiined
Wow.....what a wonderful piece of trash from the original trash man himself.
this song isssss fucking dopeee
Polo g - 21  Taylor Swift - 22 Jake Paul -23
Bruh we have 21 by polo g and 22 by Taylor swift and now 23 from jake Paul and the others were skipped we jump to 33 pay polo g
Ok, who wrote this one this time?
Trash song jake Paul
Your ghost writer is tradh
faze jake paul?!??!!
idk if he writing these but if you keep it 100% his music is getting way better
big fan of the news banners memes xd nice song rawr xd banger
The fact that this man is comparing himself to Michael Jordan is an absolute sin.
0:04
I ain't no hater but there's no way he wrote this.
FBI! OPEN UP!
Bruh ya'll just lying to yourself if you say this song ain't fire
Sounds like his other newer song. Same melody, basic and overhyped/overused quick beat, and repetitive
Eventually the trend of hating him will pass😁
Wow little jake all grown up🤗🤗🤗
His ghost writers needs a raise.
This was actually good.
The title is a copy of the polo g song called 21 so imma just dislike.
Daddy chill
Why does he have a blaccent 😳
Its 🤮
Anyone else think this was crappy?
This is literally the definition of garbage
Desiigner wrote this one too??
Didn’t this dude get arrested for rioting and looting a shop?
$TristanBonner I’m 21 and I live alone, I do photography to pay my bills and COVID has messed that up astronomically. It’s crazy but I’m gonna be evicted in a couple weeks so this is my last resort. If anyone could cashapp me anything for my rent, it’d be truly appreciated.❤️❤️❤️
lyrics are trash but it kinda slaps
Gotta love with the ‘news’ says Jake Paul makes another hit song when only Ksi has 😂😂
Who’s writing your songs?😂😂
Anyone else think Joey Nato was on this beat, J J Joey 0:23
hard
smelly
Martinez twins have better song
deactivate
gross
guys put this on 0 volume hits different fire
This sounds so much better with it on mute bro I swear to God
I think he has this illusion that he's about that gang life
ew
Why does jake Paul exists again
Why they hating t.f
Jake should made an collloboration with drake will be nice to hear that mix 😃
what the actually hElL
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok but why is this a bop
Who wrote this then
Who else is waiting for KSI to react to this🥱
Jakes last song before the feds got him.
jake lowkey doin sum
Look at the dislikes 😂he’s got zero talent all ghost writers
Really????  I guess have fun but this is garbage.
Trash 🚮
This song sound better if you mute the volume you should try it
Garbage featuring Garbage
This song is fire jakeeee👑👑👑👑👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn these rappers really have no talent
this song would be maybe enjoyable if it wasnt his voice speaking the verses, and idc whos doing the verses the song is below average in my opinion
🗑
So gay
This song is trash
Yo jake I’m starting to like u now
Lol this sound like fresh out of London in the beginning
Just imagine how peaceful life would’ve been if his dad wore a condom
He finally got a ghost writter and stole another rappers flow
The end is near
This feels like a Walmart dababy
This is crap
..
Oh God 🤦🏼‍♂️
Desiigner was definitely his ghostwriter. Jake repeated the same bar continuously.
Did you go bar for bar with your friend again. God must be fun having such a talented friend to give you lyrics
This vid fire 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this guy 23 looking 30 because of his forehead wrinkles and receding hairline that he hides with his hair.
Mans repeated the same bars over and over, Designer is definitely ghost writing for him
lmfaooo ksi made a music video two weeks ago w only 2 million views and urs has like 3 times as much views but in two days
Jake Paul music on the come up! No cap! Fresh outta London was clean. 23 is another step up!
Ah so the Travis Scott meal is just kicking in?
😮😮😮😮😮😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😍😳😙😘me😍😍😍
Biggest muppet on YouTube hands down
This comes up if you search 'sh*t music' lol
Jake Paul is probably dumber than the Disney character he played.
i liked the song but when i saw on this music video ¨¨ksi songs are getting worse¨¨ it just pissed me off
Jake Paul is probably dumber than the Disney character he played.
Nooo wayyyy😭this mans catchin fire
Says ksi's music is worse when he doesnt even wite his music LMFAO. And ksi makes better music when he writes it himself
Ehh I seen better but you tryed
Song slaps, no fan of this guy at all. But i see he's mimicing alot of 69 behaviour and manurisms
I make beats better than this
All beat, no content. Which is normal in the mainstream so... fuck it, do ya thang.
At this point, Jake Paul jusy cares about how much followers and views he gets then what's actually going on in the real world!
30 seconds in and your music is till bad
We're still in the midst of a global pandemic and we have materialistic bastards like him who think it's a good idea to flex off how much money he has instead of putting it to good use!!!!
"Its ok"
*Shout out to the ghostwriter* 🤫
Sim dane - lucky you. Is better
He want crazy on this song
“If you take 1 second to read this little comment, Jesus loves you and may he protect you from this disease. Amen! ❤️❤️🙏
Previous songs: 90% beat. 10% singing.  This song: 45% beat. 55% singing.  Jake's getting better NO CAP.
jake please reply are you still doing videos
Ksi punching the wall right now
Flop
This is good Jake got off the drugs
Boo gtfo bs video
Lol...? Yes.
I can dig it.
am i the only one that hates all of jake paul’s songs?
1:06 that guy got punched hard
at 1:24 it says jake paul makes yet another hit song hen haters are punching the air and acucsing him of ghost writers  fresh outta london was ghost written thought he didnt write it
Cringe..
Sad wayne and 2 chainz haven't even hit a million yet.
Yooo we need a Jake Paul ft NBA Youngboy
Kid looks like white Neymar
Who wrote this for you
I just love his songs now
He look like a white cash nasty
White people after getting 50k from their dads:
y do i like it :o aheem designer wrote this
I’m no hater and I support the bro’s taking over the industry but damn this what all the hype about???😂😂
fnaf song
Jake forgets his biggest revenue still comes from little kids he hasn’t rapped that long and only in intervals
The headline in the video read “Jake Paul woke up today people are outraged”  No I think people are outraged recently because he looted during a protest against systemic racism and held a huge party during a  respiratory pandemic that transmits through droplets in the air.
Lol this is good so he definitely didn't write it
Claim your "here before they hit puberty ticket" here
Music isn’t for everyone 😂😂😂
Cap
When are u gonna quit youtube im sick of ye
Straight garbage
*WHY DOES THIS REMIND ME SO MUCH OF DRAKEE?!*
its better when its muted.
Fellow KSI fans,      Stop being biased, I am KSI fan but this song definitely deserves some praise
Mate listen. You have personally have as much musical talent as a choking dog. Twat
Nah. This is actually good
Yo no matter what you think about jake Paul, stop being immature and admit he did good
Ghost writers are useful aren't they
That drivers accent is racist......AF. put JP in Jail ..NOW before this reached another level
If you keep making music like this I'ma have to make a jake paul playlist
Why’d u get arrested
He has no clue how to use a hook, its legit 2/3 of the song
Jake hunny, sorry to break it to you but having the feds watching you is in no way a flex
Bro this guy has ghost writers
A quadeca and jake paul track lowkey sounds fire with the new jake
This song absolutely *SLAPS* with the sound completely off
Up
The
Trash
Shut
This literally sounds the exact same
The word "another" implies the existence of a first. I have yet to hear even one.
DID HE ACTUALLY RIGHT THIS SONG
I thought you where done with YouTube.PERIDOT. THIS SONG SOUNDS SO GOOD ON MUTE
You’re still cringe no matter what
I never new you cus wow
I liked fresh out of london better
Why are people disliking the music vid
His song is like country it hits different                  When it’s off
The people that dislike the vid are Ksi fans 😂
Better than every day, tho.
I want to like it I really do but it's the same words on repeat. Even the parts that aren't chorus are just Walmart versions of the chorus. This isn't a bop it's a ringtone from the early 2000s. That being said, whoever made the beat deserves a raise.
Do you smoke jake
AYY GUYS U WANNA KNOW the song is so GOOD ITS BECASUE HE HAS DESIIGNER WRITTING HIS MUSIC
I just deleted a comment at 156 likes 😥😫
Aye yo where KSI at
Idk how this has 6.9M views, but nobodys talking about it
“YouTube doesn’t pay”
Just because you feel like jordan doesnt mean you are jordan
This song at first was sick but idk about the rest my opinion though 🤷🏻‍♂️
This song slaps
"straight outta prison" now "23 (months in prison)" damn the no prisoners album is really coming along
Didnt this guy get raided
So we gonna ignore how he was being investigated for child sex trafficking and a kid said he was raped at the team ten house ( that’s why he was raided by the fbi)
Why this slap.?
I didn't know jake paul had a fans to protect him WTF!! 🤣
Love this Can you please like my comment
1:31
GHOST WRITTER
Notice how jake pinned the only positive comment... and better yet it's a bot
Omg Jake you smoke
can we all agree this is kind of a banger
is jake paul smoking?!!!!
Jake man come on u gotta credit ur ghost writer in the headlines at least...
Sounds kinda gay
Lyrics are pure shite.
Is he buying views ? Cause the man pulls 400,000 likes on insta. Guess he really does got them watching 😂
This man looks like a rich homeless person with that beard
Damn killjasper be doing bits out here
I've climbed to the very top of Mount Everest and I still can't find where the fuck I cared
Pop
I am a big fan canbwe be friend I won't contact you all the time on poo
how can you call ksi songs trash when you make this
I swear this man wants to be black so bad 🙅🏽‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😂
lill baby ?
Was this song made in 3 minutes
lemme go ahead and dislike this before listening to it
Man having ghost writer seems pretty legit
young boy has some competition on being the worst
I kinda like it
a nasty comment
His ghost writer is quite good
"Im I" is the start of the pinned comment
Im gonna press play wish me luck
I dislike jake Paul as much as the rest of you but you’re capping if you say  this song didn’t slap
Why the hell are people still supporting this jackass?
Things like this is why I’m glad I’m deaf
I still like it’s everyday bro it was 🥳💖 this song is 💩
ipadpro
Huh surprised to see that he definitely did write this song with absolutely no ghost writers

If you like this you are a Simp
23 🥳
Who’s this?????😂😂😂 I cant hear it. It’s on mute
There is no way he wrote this song
He said he's back in his prime at least he knows he was out of his prime
White privilege at it finest i feel sick
Garbage feat. Garbage

Flames

The song is better when muted, agree with the comment below 😒😒

Coming from som1 who has hated youtubers music from the start... this is the 1st song I would actually add to my playlist.. kinda 🔥
Can we all appreciate the people who actually signed up to do this?
Like when you see a retard     Hint:your looking at him
Nice fier
He didn't write it
I miss when jake Paul dem was doing blogging like for kids and it was so fun and really fun to watch.
amam he didant right this song ahem man there must be some thing in my throut
💩💩🚽🚽
I've heard a lot about Jake Paul... but I kinda like this
Well, look what the cat dragged in!
When it's muted it goes crazy
Y’all are just gross at this point
This song is ok
Honetsly sounds like Tory wrote this 😂
I personally rather fresh outta london

"23 years of wasted life"  There fixed your shitty title

Puppet

The world made this dude famous and rich.. I’m glad Covid happen
He shoulda got a jack harlow ft

Damn this had pretty much the same beat as the last song and it had less lyricism. Maybeeeee Jake Paul was trying to stick with the same thing cuz it worked out cuz this is trash lmao
🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻
🤮
Haters mad that this a banger!!!
It’s this real
Why isn’t the ghost writer getting recognized
Swear to God every YouTuber trying to be a rapper
The reason why his new songs have so many YouTube views and so little Spotify streams is cuz ppl are too ashamed to look up the song on their own 😂
Fight Dillion Danis puss
his songs are dope i love it keep up the hard work
Hot garbage
Added my dislike
This song jam tho!
😂
KSI forever
Next joke.
Who else just came to dislike
Jordan is probably crying lol. Jordan is like why is Miley cyrus wearing my jersey again.
Guys slow down, I can’t like all of these comments
Eh, lyrics are subpar   But the bass is "ok"
Taylor Swift: 22 Jake Paul: 23
👻✏🤫
Thanks, now I have cancer
What's really funny about this is the headline at the beginning.  People used to care about this fool but no one's mad about him waking up in the morning anymore because they got tik tok kids to complain about.      You just know he wishes it was 2017 again.
Can’t believe I’m saying this... I would rather listen to jake than ksi
So jake how’s designer
My nigga is really riding on that beat tho🔥🔥🔥💯 I ain't expect that
The video was too short and too repetitive.   But it sounded good though 🤔
This actually 🔥thi
People dislike these for no reason, this is fire🔥
No bad words
Who wrote this one?
Damn who wrote this one 😂😂😂😂
Dam this song is fire 🔥 from everyday bro this is way way better
Damn...... It's actually pretty good though.......  WHAT. .. Who is this rapping....?
Noob
Y’all act like he cares bout y’all opinion I sure wouldn’t if I rich asf and had 20 mill followers
Broo you chould do a month of daily Vlogs please talk ebout lebanon please !!
He literally just said the same thing over and over for a minute and 48 seconds
Another song that he didn't right lmao  Cant believe people still like this dumbass
Random fact: everyone here is liking their own  comments!
Songs a madness at 2:06

This had 5.4 mil this morning and now 6.6 mil views! Keep up the good work jake
trash
Hey bro got to get your and lil baby on next release !

Fam is it even a thing where people still talk about money, I feel people are talking about depression
Bro this song hits hard
how am i 23 sittin on 23    ill answer scaming kids for merch sales you are in no way  a rapper bud
Damn didn’t think Jakes GhostWriter still existed
"Jake Paul makes another hit song" yeah only ever on YouTube because you have 20 million subs and is beefing someone that isn't only relevant because of how dumb he is.
I wonder who wrote this one for him
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇦🇼🇦🇼🇦🇼🔥🔥🔥🔥😈😈
who wrote this one jake? was it, designer again
Whys this gotta be made by him i cant listen to it now just gotta delete this ig
This song is FIRE but jake Paul still dum
I love your music videos
No sauce at all
Straight up stole pops flow
Does anyone want to grow together
His ghost writer must be getting paid a lot of money
Rubbish
Yea some one wrote this to
I like this song but the part of him saying he doing it with 2 girls just bothers me other than that his song is dope
I thought he left  YouTube? Sadly hes back
He didn't write btw
Ayo wtf?
Disrespectful to MJ
Crap  this is ####
Suga wears it 1000000000x better
Who’s the writer this time
If only he could write his own rhymes and was a functioning adult
Donkey can sing better than you. But today this is music lol.
Wack AF 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like this if he doesn’t write his songs.
The 143k dislikes are the people who like the regular Benz
Proven fact Jake Paul has a ghostwriter
Sad that this song slaps
I would would rath kill someone then listen to this
Fun fact: before this video none of us thought 2020 could get any worse, and we were all wrong!
this slaps on mute
He gotta ghost writer 👀
Copying drake
Justin Bieber 2.0
I bet he'd be a more successful rapper if he wasn't a total tool. It's hard to pretend this doesn't bang, but I'll never play it again cause it's Jake Paul. He should pull a Justin bieber and become more likable.
2 for 2
imagine you trying to remember the words
bold of him to assume anyone still cares about him
Okayyyyyy jakeeeee
i thought he went to jail what
Love this , something good to look at amidst all the chaos.
crap.
This song goes hard on mute

I actually like his music now, he has come a long way from how it was
Banger vid

Lets Give credit where its Due ... Jake paul  2  - KSI - 1
Ok who wrote this one

2:05 ayo this ma favourite part of the song
is itjust me or was i wrong about jake i thought you were a abd rapper and bxer but i was wrong
I’ve honestly never been a massive Jake fan but I’m here for it. Love what I’m seeing, keep spitting Jake

He should get a big artist to feature on this song for the second verse
Im here to drop a dislike and a comment
;( im sad, this perfect beat had to be ruined by jake paul...
I wonder who wrote this song
the comments are always crazy here
Who's the ghost writer
This sound like the fresh outta London flow but faster just me ?
Hi
This is horrific. Thank you and goodnight.
meh 2/10 should’ve wrote it ur self
Sure, Jan. 🤣😂
why do yall feel the need to make music when you know you aint good at it
Did he robbed a bank and put his money in a bank
drakes videos are obviously his inspo
.... he's still alive ?
It's the way he said "NO CAP" for me luv🖤
Your ghost writer is a really good rapper
If you close your eyes and mute your phone, this is straight fire
Song bang on mute
Garbage

If this wasnt a jake paul song i would probably like it

Nobody:  Me: Why Jake Paul made a song called “23”🧐?  Also me: His Ghostwriter is black 🤯
This song is good though 🔥🔥
the song is bad  OK it is good for Jake Paul
Ghost writer
As an unprofessional doctor, with no PHD Or knowledge whatsoever, I just want to say everything in this video is unsafe from the risk of covid to the burning flames and Jake Paul being in the video.
THIS song ASS BRO
Bro honestly we all know that he didn’t write this song so I just came to dislike
Gosh he looks so different
Sounds like nails on a chalkboard
Flexing all this money but he cant pay he's taxes😂💀
1:23 when u go up to the front of the class to present ur project

Honestly these last two song would be good if he just admitted he had a pen look at drake man admitted and he still slaps
People who watch this , look what he doing whit ur money his money are ur clicks  , stop watch this idiot
Wow from 1.37 it almost sounds like it could be trippie redd adlibs or trippie made the song and passed it to him for a fee

Funny how many dislikes this video has. If anyone one else rapped this it would be a hit
Another song with the same monotone flow throughout. So boring. He needs to hire someone to write hooks with melody
Me waiting for Logan’s verse like 👁👄👁
I’m so confused I thought his target demographic was 12 year olds and he’s rapping about threesomes
ok yeah but wheres the dead body
Ksi new songs is 2x as good
It was good
I’m so confused I thought his target demographic was 12 year olds and he’s rapping about threesomes
Spoiler: he didn’t write this.
Spice gum giving you a page out of his book ? Ehhhh
give back jeff bezos money
Ngl jakes songs are tough
Retire
If Jake wasn't such a slappable idiot I would say that this song is pretty good but because ik what he's like I can't say that😌 personally I like KSI loads better because he Is a funny and very kind person Jake is just a Spaz nglllll
Him wearing the Jordan jersey is a descrace
Jake just does whatever the f*** he wants and he made it so keep the grind
🔥
big up jakes gohst writer he deserves all the credit
No cap, this song goes hard
I’ll love jake paul
ghost writers probs wrote it for him
Is no one going to talk about how his ex was in the passenger seat

I can smell the ectoplasm.
This song is so lit man

That dance execution at 1:31💀
This guy's literally just repeated the same 5 lines over and over
ok but his ghostwriter can RAPPPP
I’m surprised he so far kept it up
Hi

Glad to see the ghost rider came in handy for him
Ing shave
Is this parody?
We went from songs about fried chicken to this and people still think he's writing these songs lmao
This song bad
He literally just kept saying the same words
U 23 but u look like your 43 lay off the coke
God damn it💀 this was kinda tuff 😭🔥
I’m guessing Jake payed verified youtubers to comment on this video.
Me=a lovely dislike
He didn't say merch link in bio= ghost writer
Dope song bro im looking forward to more            TRASH✌️
That "no cap" aint sound right coming out bro mouth. hell nahh

Say what you want about Jake Paul but this is fire ngl🔥🔥
The fact that anyone thinks this is talent is astounding. The guy literally doesn’t even understand a basic musical progression. The standards of some people are about a low as they go.
If u know the signs it’s pretty obvious that he’s a sociopath.
Y’all needa chill out let the man breath.

𝔞𝔲𝔱𝔦𝔰𝔪
A copycat of Drake. Tone, dance moves, camera, editing - all “inspired” by Drake
Alot of money to be made in white rappers
Ppl that like his music or any you tubers music at that is what’s wrong with this world
You know jake I didn’t ask
🔥no entiendo un pingo pero me gusta🔥
I’m ngl the song lowkey slaps
Love the song
What the hell
I think that is kind of too narrow to sit on that thing😉

I’m waiting for this to reach at least 1,000,000,000 dislikes
I would've listen it  if it's 10 minutes But it's just 2 minutes fuck man
Awesome video 😆😆😆😍😍😍

Jake Paul is so cringe.
Isn’t this guy the same guy who owes millions to the Irs?
2:00 song with the same lyrics regurgitated 42 times nice
The fact he doesn’t know what at least 15% of these words actually means u just know it was written by someone else 😂😂
Omg I actually like song favorite “ Igor the feds watching haters watching news watching that’s whole lotta eyes “ this is so hard 🔥
How long have I been gone cause to me it looks like he grew up and really found himself.
Jake is cringe af
Trash

He finally revealed his iq
Me: *sighs* Who's the ghost writer now?
KSI KSI KSI KSI KSI
"I like the seats that recline" Um, i thought all seats DO recline there sir 🤔

Dam this so good I’m I only listen to it
Dope
Banger <3
1:49 "Jake Paul makes  another hit song. And accusing him of ghost writers"  Everyone: We didn't accuse you  it was just facts.
when your writer/producer credits are blank on dsp's you're a few things:  1. sus 2. disrespecting the people who actually worked on that song 3. fooling no one
What happend to Disney doe🤫
Jake stop being good I miss making fun of your music. You suck as a person but this song slaps
ghost writer
Those who liked this video are blind ❤
Yo designers new song is sick
I hope he wrote it. If he did im happy

Man this guy srsly put “ksi’s songs keep getting worse” in the headlines 🥱🤦‍♀️😭
Jake Paul: No i'm a dog  Jake's Ghostwriters: *No were the dawgs*
This is actually good y’all England niggas hatin
Mans said fuck it if Jack Harlow can do this. I can to🤣
This video is only trending because of the comments
Jjs Reddit be like 🤑
Ok, who's the ghost writer
Jake did his thing us ohioans know how to make music lol
Who came to dislike

This is the irritating middle school kid making a good joke for once.
The beat is literally the same this song is trash f u jake paul ksi has more monthly listerns and he is better boxer
I LIKE
No way he wrote that 😭😭😭
it’s funny how he’s trying to act hood

He better at music I mean before it was kinda good but now he fire🔥🔥
I have been a fan since the original its everyday bro and i still love his music
YO JAKE wassup?

I started bopping my head and was disappointed that I liked this song😭
Thanks Jake for making good music. Keep up the good work
i’m mad for miley
I remember this dude from Bizaardvark....
I legit looked up sh*t music💀💀💀
This is the most cringe music I’ve ever seen...
Is he allowed to say that about jor
Guess we know the next jj olatunji vid

dis is bed
Weed fixed you Jake Paul
Assssssszs
This is kinda catchy i might check out dessighers new stuff
Who wrote this one for you jakie
I dead and got reborn in a world Jake Paul music is getting better
Dude it may sound good to u but it’s litteraly just an algorithm that has a lot of bass and auto tune which will obviously appeal to a normal audience, the hook is trash and the beat is the only thing making him sound good. Bass appeals to anyone and he is stretched it to the limit and there is litteraly nothing special or unique about it. Technically genes sounding like every XXL rapper.
He wrote it
I remember when Fletcher was interviewing them when they were shooting this video
LMAO WHAAAAAT IS THISSS 😩😭👎💨
All your new music has been better than anything KSI has ever dropped no 🧢
to many haters smh
This would make Jordan change his number
thats sick man
this song woulda been better if it had the right feature , feels like it’s missing something and that the song isn’t complete
This shii is bogus🤮
Its pretty good tho
An1 know who the girls in the back of the car are?
This is fire
There is no reason for this to have 136 k dislikes yall j hating
Jake's song bangs
I thought this guy peaked in 2017🙄
This dropped lower then Anesongib

This makes me cringe
Ghost writer probably
0:52 is that intentionally supposed to look scrotal..?

How on earth is on trending its terrible

Jake, you do realize that almost every car has seats that recline right?
The way he says j-j-joey in the beginning of fresh outta London and 23 maybe he is the ghosewriter (hmmmmm)
I came to dislike 🥰
I have 6 Subscribers. you should help :D I wont post to mess up your feed. I'm just trying to grow from comments.
trash
Back to writing shite songs haha stick to your ghost writer
Who else went directly to the comment section?
Idk who wrote this but they must of got that massive bag of money in the back
I guess someone is called ghostwriter 😂
Why does he look like a white version of drake and low-key sound like him
🔥🔥🔥
I'd put this straight on my playlist if it was rapped by anyone else other than jake
Anyone else see how he ain’t inhale😭
LP: Lizard People: look up “coconut milk: the reptilian beverage” and thank me later
I wish its bad so i can make fun of it but its good i gusse😒
Anyone else notice on the news reports it said “KSI’s songs keep getting worse “ what a sellout
As a jake paul hater, who cares who writes it. Thats just a plus, he is singing it and performing it well. So is still a banger and credit to him.
🔥🔥🔥
Ngl like the song but no way he made all of this on his own....just can't b true...compared to the effort ksi is putting in its just incomparable
Yeah it's a decent song but we all know he didn't write it
Damn I wonder who he had write this
Did designer write this one too
Dude idk basketball that much but I bet anyone who is number 23 is embarrassed
I  love  this  song  so  much.
Wow this song is dope
I like the song its so engrytik i love you jake
This guys still puts vevo on his songs..
He pays his ghostwriters good
This cure my covid 19 Thanks jake.
This is so embarising  How bad can it get
I mean his ghostwriter has some SERIOUS TALENT
If this was made by anyone else, i would actually listen to it a lot
So a guy that got his house raided by the feds gets his vid on trending.....
Same flow....
Hey guys,i disliked the video,hope you have a great day
So is he turning 23 or 32?
just came to dislike...bye!
*News: Jake paul woke up today and decided to rent a benz and make a music video*
How you make fresh out of London, a song that's actually kind of okay, and then go back to making trash like this lmfao
Great Music!
KSI is way better no afence like if u agrre
Who was here whenever Jake just turned famous
almost as much dislikes as likes
Just put his personality aside for a moment and judge this song while being unbiased. This song is quite good man✔️
L

He changed up way too much
Wtf no
"Jake Paul makes yet another hit song" how much of  narcissist is this guy

Jake Paul is on trending Me: *jumps off the cliff*
Song hits
Jake's Paul ghost writer is a G.O.A.T
Just here to dislike 👎

God I hope he loses his fight and if he does win which is likely then I am excited to see his face on the canvas with babatunde the african warrior standing over him.
Dead
23 actually is a nod to the price of his medical bill after getting the coronavirus
Guessing Desiigner wrote this one for him as well
ayo why does this sound good?
Look at this dude thinking he’s cool when he’s smoking 😂😂😂
Notice how he posting these like a day before KSI 😂😂
Finally, something you can listen to and like. Good job jake, keep it going.
Damn, I guess when your filthy rich, u can do whatever the f!@?k.

Ngl, this is a good song.
JOKE PAUL iF U SEE THIS REPLY TELLING ME who ACTUALLY WROTE THIS song
This song lit ❌🧢
Dude this music slaps when you mute it!
He white and tries to act black wtf his music is garbage
hes a good rapper
this is pretty terrible, I had a feeling designer wrote straight outta london. Imagine requiring someone else to help you write your music, just to be a one hit wonder lmfao
23 Ghost writers my boy?? How you go from "I just dropped some new merch and it's selling like a god church" to this??? Cold song doe i cant even lie...
Lets be honest if this was anyone else this would be a hit
See ion like jake Paul but this shii low key slaps
Trash. Jake you ain't cool. You know you  will lose to KSI. Trolling KSI doesn't make you perfect.
1:51 bottom of screen it says ksi songs are getting worse that shows how much of a dumbass he is because ksi at least said and agreed that his last song slapped smh
Whos Here After Watching Trend 3 Of Verbalse Lol!
Whos this written by en
Desiigner?
eyyyyyy fire
😷😤😷😤
He's scared to show who wrote it in his "credible" source spotify😂😂
He really wants me to kill myself 😂😂😂
Good song but only 1 verse? Dissapointed
The dude from the video “lucky charms breakfast bar is trying to destroy  me”  has more bars than Jake
Who wrote it
this bangs on mute ngl
jordan would be upset
This is ass
Tf is this
Everyone on youtube: dislike on Apple/Spotify: on repeat with favorite.
Trash
The song ain’t too bad
Can’t stop listening
This is a good song, but he totally didnt write this. Watch.
Having ghost writer is fine but Just admit that you have a ghost writer that's all you need to say
Fire
Jake Paul has j dropped 2 really good  songs that people can listen to regularly. I have no words spect dawg
No ghost writer, ight 😂🤣
I have that looney toons jersey
smn has blocked g h o s t  writer
ew wtf is this
HUNNY UR CANCELED!<3
that was a waist of my time
A two minute song that repeats the same chorus 6 times and people like it? What is happening to the world
Did he pick the ugliest maybach on purpose?
Yo this slaps
That was gas dawg. Flow, vocals, bars, visuals, with no bullshitting, it’s all there.
When you and the boys do a heist in gta

Yha lll haters are dumb
I’m so annoyed that this slaps
Like his new songs!
STRAIGHT TO THE BANK HERE NO CAP

😂😂ghost writer
Why is your ghost ride in your video
This nigga really spat one verse and called it a ‘hit song’. The dislikes say others bro..
All the likes are 7 year olds
Mann i like this one idk abt ur matter or abt other songs but this one is really  good👍🏻
The ghost writing is just unbelievable
Hello Jake please...                  Say hello to your ghost writer for me😄
Jake: how am i 23 sitting on 23 Also Jake: does 2 and 0 with his hands.
BRO NICE GHOST WRITER
This catchy idc
this dude is a walking L, why he trending?
Why it sound the exact same as straight outta London?
Anyone know who the guy playing the chauffeur was?
this shi hard but fresh outta london is way better
Trash
Bruh designer wrote the whole album
I LOVE THIS SOMG JAKEEEE
Awful
Alright where is the ghost writers??
see for this ik he wrote it for a fact cuz he just straight up repeats the same lyrics over and over , and you call this trash music ???
He didn't write song already know
Im kinda a hater but, this isn’t actual garbage.
I mean good song but he ain’t write it
He rlly dissing ksi. I hope ksi wins the match
Can you  make more videos
No disrespect but you shouldn't sing
Only like this comment if he will ever write his own music 👇👇👇👇
make sure you press the dislike button before watching and watch with adblocker
This is actually good
Bruh im only subbing because of the songs hes been making so far
im mad bcuz its something that i would listen to  in my free time
this song hits different on mute
Who's the writer again
Man looks like Miley Cyrus when she did 23 with Wiz khalifa
lets all remember  this is jake pual and anyone can get a ghost righter and make a song especially when you got money
How can you people listen to this garbage you can’t even understand what he’s saying
After a long time about a year or so I stopped watching him for some reason then I see this        Lol
Guess what Jake u didn’t write this.
you changed
Dead singer
I kinda like it
just stopped by for the 2nd time to see the like/dislike ratio for this trash.
It's kinda good
So trash
Ksi fans 100 percent came on for a second just to dislike😂
🚨 ghost writer alert 🚨
Just look at the dislikes😂
😂👁👅👁
First from making clown videos to rapping
Dude your trash and this come from a 12 year old
huh gaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy
His getting better ngl
Yassss keep the music coming 😋
You all just haters you need to shut up this song is 🔥 jake Paul 👍🏻 much love
0:43 ksi songs keep getting worse
Tbh these people who keep hating getting on m nerves
Why did I click on this..
All the people saying this is trash are the same people who would do anything to have the money you got.
he didnt write this
What has 2020 come to...
Dislike the video if you want to live
The only reason this is getting views is because people are coming here to dislike it
This song is to good I like the ending though but all way through just🤯
I’m sorry for giving this a view
trash
Who's mad that this song kind of sounds good 😤.
Write this one aswell🤣?
who wants subscribers
КТО ЛЮБИТ МАМУ💞💓💗:Подпишимь на мой канал!😚😚😇😇😄
I’m from the uk and if I got caught listening to this I would be put in a spliff styll
no way did he write this
GO BACK TO JAIL PLEASSSSEEE
Ooh his new songs are lit🔥🔥
Ksi music is better since he actually changes the flow and the accent but this is a banger I can’t lie
Lol😁😁😁
he went bar for bar with his FRIEND
In my unbiased opinions I think the song is lit. Also, i couldn't give 2 fucks about his ghost writers. If he even has them. Drake had ghost writers, and people were like "He did it better tho-" so, Jake is good with delivering it. There are hella rappers/singers with ghost writers and they can't deliver the lyrics. So, i think he has improved on that tbh.
I wasted 2:06 of my time watching this terrible video.
Hes copied and hes trrash
I am actually vibing with this!
All this is is 1 more clue to find his ghostwriter
Anybody can rap a pre made song, but his ghost writers got the real talent
why are the none of these idiotic people in the comments talking about the captions on the news feed
Flexing money but we can easily take that away from him 😂😂😂😂😂
I would be very happy if you would rate my channel😊
Another damn ghost writer, Jakey is going crazy with these ghostwriters
Burning money 🤬🤬
good song dawg ian gone cap
Jake to dumb to write the lyrics
This is why I listen to noise music
Jake, your ghost writers calling you man..
This writer is really good 👻
I thought jake paul was kid friendly but now's he's just Something else....
you're still irrelevant and canceled please leave
Yall disliking because its Jake Paul, This songs actually sicccc
No ❤
Wonder who wrote this?
I thought there would be a FBI feature
Jake Paul thank you. I have been very depressed for many months now. But your song motivated me. I was finally able to be motivated enough to be able to get up, and turn this garbage off. I was never able to before, but your song inspired me to do it, because of how terrible it was
Man really thinks he gonna be a rapper😂
5/10
Umm anyone realize the auto tune??
He went hard 🤣
Nice like racio
His ghost writers are doing bits for him
Someone gave birth to him?.......................,..................                   Someone gave birth to him.......................       The frick why?.......................         This song doesn't make sense ................................................
I like how he tries to say he doesn’t ghostwrite, yet it is proven that he does lmao
Hey Jake just wondering if you could make a video on how to buy a Lamborghini cash? teacher never taught me how to do that
If this thing you wrote... I can understand why it's only 2 minute
This dude doesnt even write his own songs lmao
Du you no that tana is saying that she is pegnit fom you
jake paul : new song ksi : aight who wrote this now
well it's no suprise...Jake how much you pay the ghost to write this...😂 You really need attention to be relevant huh
Do kobe rap jake you lit
Who came here to see what he was up to btw this song is fire 🔥
society has progressed past the need for Jake Paul
Y’all hating on bro lol.

Douche bag alert. I repeat douche bag alert! Lol he is so cringy
Ghost
Sorry the 134k dislikes are from the unsuccessful ppl
I would rather listen to spongebob songs than this
Hmmm, so he has 2 Ghost writers.
I'm looking forward to see what KSI has to say about this lol 🇬🇧
Kids in 2020:

This song is mad on mute
Nice song Jake or should I say 👻✍️

I thought Mikey Cyrus already made this song ?
Yass jake is nearly back like he use to just carry on jake I miss the old u
Where is your camera inside of your arm
These songs are actually fire
Didn't write this and the last one. NO "BUY MY MERCH LINE".Still sounds fire.
NO CAP THIS SONG A BANGER
Oh he's done from stealing and vandalizing during riots then?
Jake is going big!

stfu jake
Cody and Noel need to do another That's Cringe
All: It's so cool!!! I like his new song. I: *call the FBI
Trash
Another ghost writed song
How do ppl like this
KSI progressed over like 8 years to where he is today with music, Jake went from absolute shite straight to 2 okay songs that are lyric wise way above him. That’s the proof, no chance he writes his songs on his own cmon now.
Fun Fact:Canada eats more macaroni and cheese than any other nation in the world.
"save 23 to your music library"-WE GET IT MATE
Mans got more Ghost riders than Drake
This song is actually good
🌽
Why are people net banging rn? Like chill out,  it's a good song...
This was fucking fire
Who’s the ghost writer
nice! XD
“Jake Paul makes yet another hit song” Um was there ever a hit song?
Collab?
just scrolling through the comments like everyone
Jake stop bragging post your video and go
Wack. He had a bit of his own lyrics this time LMFAOOO
KSI BRO U GOTTA EXSPOSE HIS SONGWRITER
Lame as Always
This is awful
This is ass
How am 23 feeling like Jordan Rip Kobe 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎶🎶🔊🔊🔊🔊
Love the way it has 134k dislikes thats 134k views of people who are just haters giving this guy more views hahaha love haters 😅🤣
am i the only one that  thought he wasnt a rapper until today, i knew him for like 4 years and bruh i never knew he could rap or sing or whatever he is doing
Wigger
The hook is trash and his verse is mediocre. The only thing holding the song together is the beat
23 by Oliver Francis was better
I bet you you 1 million/dollars       You tapped on “read more”
Definitely ghost written lol
he hard
Ghost writer
Y'all need to stop hating on jake that nigga hard ash
How many choruses are there in this song 😂
🤣this is actually dope🔥
So cool bro jake
This heat
It was the same verse over and over again... this isn’t real rap
Yea wheres fresh out of jail
Trash
NDL
I’m pissed off that I like this
someone musta dared the "DARE ME BRO" to do a drake-esq video
Turn your volume down to 0 (trust me, it will sound better)
He didn’t write this anyone remember it’s everyday bro😬
So who wrote this one
I am starting to listen to real music. This is why I am here. _X
Ain’t even gon cap this was heat fr
We need change in this world. _x
Probably didn’t right it
This was really good
okay jaky, i see you dode
Just when you thought 2020 couldnt get any worse
That was a banger though!!
This one was aight. Fresh outa London was way better.
Jake has so many haters😂😂😂
Wasn't this guy robbing shoes???
And this is how is a  how to on how to absorb culture with money and overwhelm it
Just be a YouTuber !
Isn’t he like 32 or something get a life
“My house is located here at these coordinate”  -surprised pikachu face-  “WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE?”
One verse and a chorus which is repeated 3 times. Flows are nice, but the lyrics have no layers. Good song at surface value if Jake wrote it, but, doesn’t take a whole lotta talent to make a song like this.
Wtf.. jake... wtf u acc made it on my playlist..
Thought he was done with youtube, disappointed.
ghost writer
I love it
10/10 cringe
This is his best song yet . Fire!!!
The song is fire 😈
Ksi's songs are better
I just came here to dislike this.
He’s shaped funny to be dressed in basketball clothes 😂 looks like a oblong wearing clothes.
Why the hell these boys sounding better these days haha 2020 full of craziness
Atleast one of you has to admit hes changed alot and is 70% less cringey
AYO HIS GHOSTWRITER SNAPPINGGGGGG
Take Jake Paul and give us back Juice Wrld
Song is cold. Only if he wrote 💀

Jake is gross and needs to get his life together
hard💥
I'm just here to dislike the video lol
Imagine Pinning the only comment that says the song is good
This is a very auto tune
If you listen carefully 02:06 is the best part
One of the blandest songs ive ever heard
I thought this man was in jail.
I thought the fight was today
Just disliking, couldn't care less if this was good, his past his literally doing this to him
Gay
Honestly.. that wasn’t that bad🤷🏾‍♂️

Big yikes
Get this off of the trending page
I feel bad for the dislike button. He has been touched too many times on Jake Paul vids
At least credit the writer !
Send me some merch
Let’s be honest, every song he makes would just sound better with Tory Lanes singing them
Who else here waiting for this song to get more dislikes than likes.
💩
Me: All right FBI: Fresh outta Jake's house is better
The song title tells how many chromosomes Jake has
Yet another poopy song
Look like he shoving that bag right up his b hole
why this song actually go hard
Funny how a dude with no skill tries mumble rap. It's almost like mumble rap has no skill involved
So...Jake Who Wrote This One For You 🤔
He is buying views
🔥
Generic rapper flow when KSI is bringing new styles and flows with every song, sorry g but you cant say KSI is trash and get away with it when you have a ghostwriter lol
Male stripper - 23 (official music video)
Amazing now i can say jake going to boom

I wonder who wrote this one?
He still makes videos? Videos that still get on trending? Music videos that Jake Paul makes that aren’t diss tracks that get in trending? Damn.
KIS IS PISSED AFTER THIS
The title should've been: "Jake Paul ft. ghostwriter" - 23"
I came here to dislike

Honestly if he didn't have sooo many haters this Ong would on the Billboard list foso
Bruh whoever rights this song are garbage
This is like fresh outta london when you add 10 more ghostwritters.

Search up "Sh*t music" on youtube, and this shows up.
So bad he needs 2 ghostwriters
Jake is such a clown

So, what I understood, is that he likes Mercedes and wants a threesome at the age of 23... That's all I got.
Song legit mostly a hook but that "No Cap" In the beginning🤦🏻‍♂️😅
Please have a ghost writer for this one as well because people just can't stand you music when you write it

Dear precious ones, let us all work together to build the kingdom of God. This can be done by working together, side by side, by showing love toward one another and by pointing others to Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Today we see damaged families and a broken society. But Jesus came to build the kingdom of God through the transformation of lives.               We can help to rebuild our neighborhoods by showing others they can find hope and new life in Jesus Christ. All of us have something to do. So let us work together and do our part -- whether big or small -- to create a community of love where people can find Jesus.              Start laying a foundation of righeousness in your life by giving it completely to Jesus Christ. Confess with your mouth and believe with your heart that Jesus is Lord and Savior of your life. Receive Him, believe in Him and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. Allow Yeshua (Jesus) to work in you to rebuild you in His holy name, and also work through you to bless the lives of others. It will be the GREATEST decision you will ever make. May Father God our Creator bless you in the Mighty name of Jesus Christ our Savior. ❤️❤️❤️

He’s using the same Ghost Writers as Drake now.
That like ratio tho
Who’s the writer then jake, ksi is gonna drop you
lol this is a 20/10 compared to any of jjs songs
He makes it embarrassing to be a white guy.
The fire is hotter than his music 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kill jasper killed this lol
Bro didn’t just Nubes house got raid
Okay Jake 👌🏾
Ya sounds very similar to another song lol
So... had Jake Paul came on the scene looking like this... with this music... 🤔 he might’ve been a problem.
I liked the last one but this one was dead 💀 💀
This song hits different on mute
Dang he hit the news guy like he was none
His writers are the guys on the roof lol
I miss the old jake
Why does his chin look like a crescent moon 🌛
all songs are the same- money, fame and flexing on literally everything
Dude really actin like a victim🤡
Your so bad
his dancing is proof enough he didnt write this
🤯😵🥊💪😡
This beat do be hard do
Who's idea was it to make this dude famous? 🤦‍♂️
Ah yes the definition of aids
some people just aren’t meant for beards
This guy is cancer.
You suck
It literally sound the same as fresh outta London
Ah, the laughing stock of the internet
For all the delusional jake fans out there thinking jake gets more streams than ksi. Jake is only getting good numbers on YouTube. On Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, ksi is charting way higher than jake even in Jake's own country USA lmao
5mil views in a day
already shits on ksis career
How many ghost writers wrote this? 👇
Lol
(Sniffs) 👃 do I smell a ghost writer
imagine dababy on this track🔥  Jake did good tho🙌🏼
Let's be real if it wasn't for Jake Paul's image he would be on top of the game about now
Yo did this guy do some questionable things before sure.....but this is straight 🔥🔥
No, leave :( leave
Time for a LMTH and TWOTI and 'I watched jake Paul's new music video so you dint have to' And 'We need to stop jake paul'
So who wrote this song this time?
I’m just waiting fo Greg Paul to make an appearance
Aight where's WillNE
Im upset that I watched this
Bro u nailed it 🤟🔥
i disliked before watching
This song stuck in my head
honestly though  ok so, it's obviously ghost written but ok ignoring that, Logan's bit is horribly green screened, the camera angles make me feel a bit sick honestly and it sounds like every. single. jake. paul. song. ever.
More YouTube video’s please
DAMN 💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯
His ghostwriter really did carry this song. That's the only reason this is better than JJ's new song cuz one of them is genuine the other is the product of an industry plant.
This man  Songing Like Dababy
Props to his producer tho 👏beat goes harddd
Another ghost writer I’m guessing
who wrote this  they better be getting 60%  they b making bangers for u
Everyone dislike this

gagagarbage
Does 23 represent his IQ?
Why does every American song involve fucking or kissing
*Again this is how we know jake didn't write this*
This song slaps as hard as his other songs (doesn’t slap at all)
Bizzardvark kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
This song makes me wanna send Doctor Phil to the ranch.
*A moment of silence for the dislike button everytime jake drops a song 🙏*
Yeah i believe its good , ghost writer did a great job
how can you have a ghost writer but still make shite songs
y’all douchebags for 100k dislikes.
Jake drops a music video          *Dislike Button: " here we goo again"*
this is trash.
JAKE MY MAN LEVELED UP!!👍
This song hits different when you get in the bath and plug the toaster in
NOPE

Ghost writer
He so has ghost writers
Best idea stop watchimg this guy so he doesnt get any money because he is flexing with it
Le garbage
Jake's music is way better than KSI's music.
Who tf wrote this for you this time?
You know what  I feel like even when he was coming up like back a long time ago, when he would make music with team 10 and the after I think he still made good music a lot of people didn't understand his music
Ksi songs keep getting worse 0:20
Get ksi to trending #1
Jake Paul got old when we hit 2018
He just says the same thing 60 times
idk why y’all hating so much the song actually good 🤷‍♂️
Who deceived you and told you that your voice is wonderful? 😂.
Lowkey kinda fire 🔥
Jeez Jakes ghost writer knows how to make some madd lyrics jheeeez 🔥
Why he think he can rap he so bad it’s funny I wonder if he thinks he’s good
Ghost writers
Jake Paul:I write my songs Me:Are u sure about that?
2 for 2🔥
“to the bank no cap”  reference to cap by ksi ft. offset and the lyrics.
Is this what Covid 20 sounds and looks like?
Did he write it tho
How embarrassing
The fact that you still upload and still make videos it now makes sense y u were in Disney
Ghost wrighter

Jake paul, Like if you agree
This track is wack
this song is actually pretty decent!
Yeah it hits better on mute....
The only thing that’s fire is this beat
Designer wrote this too
Best part of the song 2:06
"Jesus Christ"
Tbh Jake Paul looks better with a beard, too bad his music videos are just him flexing his bullshit money
1:02 "I got the feds watchin" is he lying
Jake probably puts a ruler under his pillow to measure how long he sleeps for..
when will he quit yt like he said he would
Is this the intoduction video for Blake Griffin joining the Bulls?
Jake the type of guy to sleep with socks on
This is trash. Go stream Loose by KSI and S1mba
Ym should a kid a favour and subscribe
w

Really youtube? How u gonna put this on trending
This is your best song no cap🧢
I fw ksi heavily but if jake keep coming wit this heat he gone make ksi music look like kids bop if we really being honest ksi music only doing numbers cause of his fans if it came down to just randoms listening I’m pretty sure jake got the dub
He’s using a famous rapper to ghost write and the song still doesn’t sound good
Disliked before i clicked on the video

Find new video director.
Wtf

Listen at the end of the day this mans no dumbass he's going to make everyone feel stupid saying ghost writer but he actually is using a ghost writer
Ahh another song about money and bitches. Boring.
I usually appreciate a switch in flow or tempo but 1:00 was disgustingly bad

Lame ass rap lmaooooo
This song is so good on mute
🔥 Banger
but did he write it tho?
Seems like ever average rapper ngl
i love how much jake wishes he was black
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ this new song is
the song's title is about Jake's IQ
This is too similar to fresh outta London if this is all that jake can do he won’t improve I know everyone’s saying jake is trash but it’s the truth if he just raps in this style it’s gonna get boring
its the lack of dynamics for me
Trash 🗑
How to watch this video : 1. Tap the video, the tap pause right away 2. Tap the Dislike button 3. Tap the ... at the top of the screen, Report > Violent or Repulsive Acts 4. Exit the video 5. Go to Library > History > Tap ... on the video > Remove from Watch History
Whoever the fuck wrote this... Still... It's lit😍😍
Trash
Props to the ghost writer
Honestly this isn’t bad man
I’m here to dislike.
Way better than everyday bro
0:27 their career is done for
how you hit the chorus that many times when the song is barely 2min???
Ayy jake you gonna beat ksi fire song
Hard songs man
Jake paul making these rapers look like kids
Trying to find where I asked
This song fire no cap
the only good thing about this music video is that it ended
1:04 he’s having an interview with jakes ghost writer
ok
Jake : *Says he gets more views than JJs* Also jake : *lies about writing his music*, *ignores the like to dislike ratio*
It’s sad to think this guy could just. Become a father if he really wanted to Feel sorry for his child if he ever has one rather have a deadbeat father instead of a washed up father
Terrorists will play this on repeat, instead of water-boarding hostages from now on.
Why was this recommended-
This song hits different blasted on speakers 🔊
Why does it look like he is pegging himself on the bag of money???
Hey jack FBI open up your stupid followers my forgot the stuff did but I know I’ll won’t  you people just going to the FBI and all the Weapons they got  in there big house you jack pale fallows are nothing but fools wake up
should i do a reaction video to this ?
The ghostwriter strikes again
Funny enough jake paul pins one of the only comments that says this song is good😂
*Wow blind and deaf people must be lucky*
notice how the songs without a ghost writer are utter garbage
Absolute banger
Jake Paul woke up today xD
Shame he doesn’t write it
aight
If JJ watches this video and says jakes has a ghostwriter. I agree to that  Jake would never make that good of a catchy song
He is literally ripping off DaBaby LOL
bruh i was deaf but i got a hearing aid today i wanted to listen to some music because i thought it would be cool but after hearing this song i ripped my hearing aid out
I love the song  Big up the ghost writer
Now we all know why God Made COVID 19 for this people
Dislike
im in a wheelchair and all my life i haven't been able to walk but today i got up to turn this dogshit song off
the vibiest song ever on 0 volume
It's appalling to see that this disgrace to humanity still has fans.
You back
The fact this song is so bad and yet thinks ksi has bad songs LMAO
His musical talent is on another level.    Unfortunately that level is the basement along with Slim Jesus.
Why is this good.
Where's the song
Just came to Dislike
tbh he mixing is awful
his ghost writers music slaps
Where's sound at???
Miley went through the same phase. Smh
120k dislikes eeek
When you turn the volume to 0 this song SLAPS.
Damn, this song is really bad lol
Why is this actually good
bro he looks so ugly with a beard LMAO
I wouldn’t be surprised if he wrote this one himself the lyrics are whack.”I like the seats that recline” proper Paul line that
Wow, this song was bad
Is it just me or since fresh outta london you’ve been listening to his songs
Okay but let's check your monthly listeners
Its good but heres me wondering who wrote it. 🤔
This is so so so so fucking shot
OK Jake
Jake makes the song crap but If a good rapper came in done jakes but then that would be on ma playlists
If this video was aged there will be no likes and no fortnite kids in the comments also no one going like if you agree
I preferred the old jake Paul and stuff 2020 messed people up no 🧢
Am I the only one who thinks that this isn’t horrible but ITS JUST SO REPETITIVE WHERE ARE THE OTHER LYRICS
bruh this song is just one bar on repeat LMAO
My dog has similar auto tuned voice!
Yet another song he didn’t write
The 2020 disasters keep on coming.
"Sitting on 23", 23 guns in ur basement?
The funny thing is the dumbass admitted to having a ghost writer and still says he didn’t have one
He really got the chance to say “I got the feds watching” lol
Idk why he's bragging bout money when ryan toys review make mo money😂😂😂
Shits fire but who wrote it
he peaked with fresh outta london in my opinion
Ghostwtiter: jakes mom

This song is a BANGER I play it on full volume every day  So why has my neiboughs moved out
I like it 🤷🏼‍♂️
So many Dislikes 😂😂
Well jake wrote this one, aint no ghostwriter repeat the same hook 4 times in a 2 min song with a verse that has only one good bar and nothing else. But i ll give credit to his delivery, flow and catchiness of the song

You use to be a good guy. All the fame turned you into trash

My favourite bit is when it ended

At least he didn't wake up like the man
Tbh why did we ever think he was cool? 😂
Nobody like jake
The SAME flow through the entire song... thats just lazy. Like the beat is nice its a shame to do 1 flow on a good beat
Jake Paul's mom is still waiting for him to say his first word.
0:30 cheap green screen
Oh ffs that’s all I have to say!  This guy goes at jj saying he doesn’t write his music an hes got a ghost writer.
But this song hits 🔥

This song does slap but remember everyone he exposed himself on impaulsive saying that he had a ghost writer on his last song so he most likely didn’t write this one either
this guy is a joke.............cringe fest
No matter what he makes... There are some ppl who came just to dislike..... I have to admit this songs lit
Did designer write this one for you too?
Def his introduction to becoming illuminati.  Alot of 666s being thrown. 23?? Cmon... amateurs.
Hey guys turn the sound off it sounds better trust me 😉
a star is born
no
he gained some weight...
That doesn’t look like social distancing.
this honestly slaps... but whos the ghostwriter
Just because you are a YouTuber doesn’t mean you can sing
I give up
Bruh he’s actually got flow tho lmao
Just came here to dislike. Nice ghost writer btw
So this may have got 5x more views than KSIs new song but the like/dislike ratio on this is laughable
Who the ghostwriter
🤮
Best Part of the Song: 2:07
So dope
Jake  ist  🔥🔥
Song basic as hell
Better than ksi for sure
I kinda fuck w this
bruh why is this fire?
This song is shite
Kids be like this song hit hard on mute ? Sure so y'all are obsessed with Jake you're gonna just see him in a video on mute like I get it Jake's hot but y'all are to into him . god 😂
This song fire
u better be paying ur ghost write bare moneyyyyy
KEKW
Imagine being so sensitive and unable to admit your faults that you launch a shitty rap career.
You know this bad when id rather be boppin to moseys 2019 cypher
this is beyond cringey
I am a KSI fan,but i must admit,if you just listen to this songs audio,its pretty dope.KSI might be a better Fighter,but Jake Paul is a better Singer.
I wonder who wrote this song?
This is trash
Can’t even say the words on time🤦🏼‍♂️
Most dis likes i bet are from people hating that he spits flows and is white
Nice! Be black and you’d get an album my friend.
Ghost writer be creepin in the back😱🤣😂
it's every day bro
5.3M in a day😮😮😮
When is the old Jake Paul coming back😭😭😭😭
Bro look at the dislikes
Damn what a song to listen while shitting
Oh my gosh this is good because he didn't write it
Same flow as fresh outta london lol
Nope.
There's a lot I could say about this but I think it would be better for me to just leave it to Cody.
This doesnt suit him one bit
Yo aren’t you supposed to be in jail
This is just genuinely awful.
This was actually good wth
I just took a dump in the toilet. Much more fun playing with it than playing this song.
No
keen for ksi to mess up your face
This song would be way better without jake Paul in it ngl
Damn that like ratio
Kinda 🔥
My cousin walked I’m my room and asked what I was watching I showed her this she said “he looked better on Disney “ bro that’s how he got famous I did it know
Sad how all his good songs have a ghost writer
wtf I thought jake was ass 👀👀
The trash on youtube increased by 10%
Somehow his acting keeps getting worse. Acting as a rapper ain’t cutting it my dude.
I wonder who was the ghost writer
That like to dislike ratio thoo
I love your songs jake paul
Ok... where’s desiigner at doe
The tunes is great the lyric😀um no
i wouldve disliked but this low key fire   losers dislike
u sang 1 verse over and over again
honestly i liked this song more than any of the songs that play from there artists
Whoever his ghost writer is, is making a great job 😂
Bruh, this is offensive to rap music
their brother relationship is ruined because of the internet.
Yo song poppin but líp sync bit off
all car seats recline
His hair looks like spaghetti noodles
There no way he made it
Um um did u even write this song
Damn broski💯❤
This is ight. Worse than fresh outta London but it's ok. 4/10
23 the Iq of Jake Paul
He goes the whole time..i couldnt say 10 words without stopping to breath. If he writes these..pretty freaking cooooll man
I hope Jordon sues him for defamation of character
Uh uh did  u even                                                                        Write this ong
But the song is pretty fire
Your supposed to be in prison how about you head on back and never see the light of day again
Luv it
Kids watching be like : 🤤🔫
oh look the cringe's back
whats next... going to suicide forrest in japan?
This songs hits hard no cap 🧢😤😤
At least KSI wrights his music you bellend
Dislike
Bunk ass song. *No offense tho*
Jake paul woke up today...  Ksi songs keep getting worst
trash 😂
That money bag is shoved up his ass! Dope track tho!
Lyrics are sick but it just doesn’t work whenever I am listening to this I can’t take him seriously all I see is Disney Chanel jake 😂
I think I developed cancer listening to this
I swear he keeps getting better
Is this guy still relevant?
Anyone else saw that in the news thing it said “Ksi songs are getting worse”
trash
Первый русский коммент из москвы  лайк

the untucked jersey bugged me.
Oor pijn oprecht zonder grap auwww
meh
This is fart poop....
I guess fresh outta london his only decent song
Ur so delusional
I’m I the only one who’s starting to like his new songs?
Jake Paul was that kid that woke HIS DAD up for school in the morning.
The dislikes have me rolling 😋😅🤣
THIS IS HOT HOT LIKE YOUR uhhhh video? wtf its cool video!
If he wrote this one which I doubt he did but if he did he’s actually making good music
How the fuck did he star making good songs??????!?!?!?
5.2M view
This gives me the weekend vibes
JAKE GO HARD!!!!
Yo is it just me or does his new music slap
My guy growing from everyday bro bull crap the real rap
The whole song is about a bearded man flexing his money.
But did you wake up like the man?
Alright weres his ghost writer
Ghost writer...just wanted to say that in his video¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No. Just no
Am here to see the dislikes 😅 and I thought he was in jail
Spoiled brats that act like they grew up hard

🔥🔥🔥
Recent songs fire
This isn’t half bad
I like it! Good vibe while hearing!! Nice beat good flow!!!❤️🙂👍
Dopeeee
Godd songs
I think he sneezed 3 time before making this song
Uyuyyu is a beautiful girl with his eyes on 5
You know Jordan the goat when every 23 reference is him instead of Bron
Definitely a ghost writer
That logans cameo tho 🖤
HE MUST HAVE JUST ATE THE TRAVIS SCOTT MEAL FROM MCDONALD’S🤣
He smokes now ? I’ve been gone for too long by again.
If u disliked this u clicked a different video
any one miss the jake paul before him and erika was a thing 🥺
the only good thing about this is logans acting as the driver. the rest is more than forgettable.
I prefer fresh outta london
Team 10 to kids in a mansion to a thump nails of girls in bathing suits rapping and thinking he’s the man.
Bruhh so trash
Trending #2 here in Aus
Who else hears the same beat and rhyme from Fresh Outta London and saw the same clip.  Just me ok
Nah this kinda go hard
this guy makes me laugh.
Last hook is fire after 1:30 🔥
Written by Jake paul & Kill jasper
Ghost writer going crazy 🔥
JAKE  PAUL  I  LOVE  YOU
I think I'll go listen to 100 gecs now
Ghost writer
Rich spoiled brat who likes to riot and loot honest hard-working people businesses. Auto-dislike
A random person who likes this will possibly be a millionaire tomorrow.
I’m a ksi fan and you know it is pretty good but jake doesn’t write his songs
2:06 thank me later
This song is just a good beat with a chorus on repeat.
This dude pinned literally the only person that liked his song ( this was the second top comment and he deleted it)
Um why the hell did I just watch part of this ! Hmm no thanks!!
Lowkey goes hard🔥
Ur alive?
Its just something about Jake Paul bringing up Jordan's name that doesn't... sit well at all.
If you keep making songs like this your brother is going to have another body to film
Keep the dislikes going
Only to dislike
Wow such a horrible song 😂😂
I’m pretty sure Tory lanez wrote this (which is why the lyrics are dope)
Ghost writer cough cough
That one kid on fortnite

Sorry Jake 😔
Ghost writer

Jake is the kinda guy to fail a DNA test
I feel like it's become a thing to dislike every music video he makes. 😂
You got big empty nuts showing off your wealth while looting...
MJ would be ashamed to see you wearing his jersey.

Jake is a good fighter and singer and youtuber
When the ghostwriter leaves Jake:  Ghostwriter: Imma end this man whole career.
Jake paul: KSI: raps Jake paul: raps
😷 haha he Gianna gett the 😷
Is the bpm 110? Nah man Jake has good vibes too. Just cause there are alot of haters, doesn't mean he won't blow up 👌🏽👍🏾. Great job Jake
I like how Jake Paul doesn’t care about the dislikes because he got views and that means money
That ghost writer is pretty decent.
Who came here just to dislike?
When you go to McDonald’s and say “Cactus Jack sent me “
No one comments about how good the mix was? Kudos.
This song getting hated on only because it’s Jake Paul
No ghost written here folks
Logan's back must hurt from carrying this video
This is actually great
Ur showing us what YouTube got u and u said it’s a dead end
This song hits mad different on mute
He really thinks he's "hot"
It’s kill kasper ... for all those wondering
Bet he has a ghost writter for this one as well
I am a big fan of jake Paul this song is fire
Im starting to like them
Trash song. This is considered quality today? I was born in the wrong generation.
He’s bragging about how he’s rich
194k likes and 112 dislikes Wwow

Who was the ghost writer this time
Say hi to ur ghost writer 4 me
Ehhh youtubers thinking they’re  artist
Did people view this video to simply click dislike button
The fact that this is trending has made me lose what little faith I still had in humanity.
The end of the song was so hard     Cause it ended
🤢🤢🤢🥱🥱
How tf is he friends with lil mosey!!??
Everyone’s talking about him pinning the comment that says the song is good but no ones talking about how hard it must’ve been to look for it in the sea of comments clowning on him
Remember when jake Paul was slightly enjoyable...I miss vine
Best numberof this video is the like and dislike ratio.
I would love to see someone light his beard on fire
sTraight tO tHe bAnk hErE nO cAp                   shut up
ghost writer
Damn This Song Is Fucking Fire Dood My favourite Part Was 2:06 And Also Guys If you are Going To Listen To Jake Paul's Dope Music please Note that Side effects Include Ear Bleeding and Brain Damage
It's amazing how many shitty songs can be made just from flexing wealth as the chorus
Straight people are weird...
Isnt he quiting youtube
First of all, he’s stupid. Second, why is he taking it in the butt by a bag of money lmao, and third why you making out with girls with your brother in the front seat? Nasty
lets be honest we made him rich
A real rapper would’ve made this over 3 minutes.. 😐
You got a beard?
He's getting better at this
Who is a better rapper   Like: aliens Comment:jake paul
when he sits on that bag of money it looks like it is going straight up his...
Ghost writer
Man i remember when I used to watch him on Disney show Bizaardvark
How is  Lil moseys XXL freestyle better than this dogshit
What
U is ugly
To be honest this isn’t bad. Why does it have so many dislikes
Who wrote this song now?
if some other atrtes mad this ill like it but ya lmao
All the dislike is from KSI fans.
Jake who wrote it this time ?
This is uncomfortable like finding hair that isn’t yours while showering at the hotel room.
Ngl, I like the song.  But I would bet my kidney, my rectum and my dick that he didn't wrote this song. At least most of it weren't him
His confident is scary
Hey how does it feel to have your brother in jail for drugs?
Killed it frfr
The “news” says hits again more like mute again
Wow cars money hoes yay
ghost
Anyone know the name of the two girls at 0:27? With the tattoos

I’m sorry to say this is FIRE

NBA Whiteboy
Jake Paul : Puts Michael Jordan in The Song   Michael Jordan : that's when i took it personal.
My mans jake Paul pinned the only comment that said his song was good and it’s a bot
Who’s gonna win? Like - KSI Comment - Jake Paul
He pinned the "only" good comment
This song named on how many times his dad thought about pulling out
Ya no one is watching cuz no one cares
All these haters are just making him more money 😭😭🤡🤡
???
I saw this on an add, quite good.
1:32 tf is dat dance
Acknowledge me
Poor bum
no really into jake paul but this is a vibe... okay now into him
Two in a row
Make sure to get a real jersey
Then you remember that he makes videos for 8 year olds
When a white kid hears 21 savage and copies his style
bikini haul
it's everyday bro with covid-19 flow
Jake Paul in music a video: 💨💨
Would’ve added to my playlist if he wrote it himself.
The 23 Enigma
No cap i’m a whole KSI fan but I can admit that this is a good song
W

🔥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It would be good if every word wasn't made by somebody else

Its a good song but it just sound like a Travis Scott song no offense Jake
Ksi: soooooo lets see em monthly listener's
Yessssssssssuh
bbc mad rass blodclalt
23 months in prison😂😂
I wonder who wrote this song this time 😴😴😞
Was this released as a joke or was he serious?Genuine question.
Whoever decided to give this beat to Jake Paul instead of Dababy needs to go to jail
Why is this song actually good
How to get pinned: this song is good
Oh man this is so much better than on mute
the description says to save 23 to your music library. Get outta here lol
DaBaby would've went crazy on this beat
It’s giving me very muchhhhh off brand drake vibessss🥱
The only guy to make other's mumble rap look good in comparison
This song is actually good
Jake paul is the type of person to eat candy while waiting at the dentist office
Can you please go back to jail
0:30 is possibly the worst green screen attempt ever
Why so many dislikes tho it's such a nice song
Bro Jake is now trying to force a accent and act a current way... he’s even more annoying
Why y’all hating? Can’t see someone change huh?
JAKE PAUL MAKES YET ANOTHER BAD SONG
His regular vids barely get any views but his music vids get more? Something is missing here?
0:20 Jake paul woke up today, people are outraged  You're goddamn right
So who wrote this one?
im actually liking these new songs
Thanks to those who disliked
Ksi fans dislinking video 😂
didnt he get arrested
His flow is repetitive lol
Wtf i thought this guy was close to 30 or something. Y’all can’t convince me that he’s my age.
Lowkey this fye 👀
Just came here to dislike.
MJ will sue you
Eh same flow we always here , mediocre beat but I guess you’re improving but then again you also have way more money to spend on production
This man ain't lying when he said he had better music otw
This beat is actually gross I’m sorry💀
Jake Paul fell off
What’s going on with Jake all of a sudden his song r 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥
YouTube's getting real comfortable with these 15 second no skip
“Jake Paul woke up today, people outraged”
Ay its actually rlly good wtf yall haters hes better than 69😂😂😂
Jake Paul with another one
Okay.
YouTube's getting real comfortable with these 15 second no skip
Ksi will never give jake credit even though he  got better
i like this goofy driver character
Jake Paul is a real life representation of stealing black culture.
You will never be like the goat mj
It was worse than fresh outta London tbh
this is OK, but did he write it?
Sounds better faster
1:54 I thought he was boutta slap man's ass
He has improved since It's Everyday Bro. He's peaking at mediocrity. Props.
This slaps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
just waiting to KSI to react
It lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who cares that you're your car on 5 Feiger
Who else disliked before watching it?
Thank you Joyner Lucas
OMG my guy this song sounds so DAMN GOOD when it's paused or at volume 0 TRY IT OUT
That shxt hits 🔥🔥
Who else agree that his songs are getting better
I would Houdini and disappear  Write a memoir in a few years
Now I’m jus wondering who wrote this one😂
he evolved from everyday bro
You’re lying if you say these recent songs aren’t fire. Jake is leaving people stunned hahaha great job bro
Ppl call me faxe sway 2.0 is that true??
KSI have been quiet since this got released🤫🤫🤫
Why so much 👎🏽 ??
Tfxttg
What great sin have we committed to deserve this monstrosity?
Reclining seats and receding hairline
I love this song

I only clicked this vid to dislike it
Brahh😍😍

He think he had now💀💀
white boys after they’ve had the Travy Patty
This song is like every other song out and the flow is like everybody else's flow and sound like everybody else ..... trash!
I am outraged

2:06 thank me later         Good night
I’ve been watching Jake Paul since day one
Damn why so many dislikes?
ksi is getting better with time... jake paul just sounds like he spent a weekend at his black friend's house
Jesus this track is PURE TRASH!
Fresh out the dumpster
Write your own music
Shoulda just stuck with fresh outta London
your average stoner here, seeing that your audience is mainly children, why the F@?k are you giving that image off, smoking likes cool.
I wonder if Jake Paul reads the comments
Yo who wrote this one
I think u messed up in the editing, the song was the same theee lines over and over x1000000000
Stop paying for ghost writers
Ghost writers
This song can get more views if tik tik tokkers start using it
This is the worst song and music video i ever see
this song is straight fire but as a ksi fan its trash
Trashhhhhhhh
i want to know who ghost wrote for you
I thought Jake Paul was rated E for Everyone
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
This 🔥🔥 but fresh outta London is better 🚫🧢   This man is Tory lanez and polo G and throw them in a blender u get jake
When the white kid got the n-word pass😂💀
lets make this video age restricted so it has less likes
H
wanna be rapper
Anyone else feels like it's just him screaming and there is a weird beat running along it
This is the Everyday Bro successor
His ghost writer is good at making songs,
He doing music just cause KSI is doing good. Hater.
I skipped to 4 different parts and each one sounded exactly the same, Pls go back to vine where u belong
Jake paul has the best ghost writer's
This is really bad
shouldn’t have sold ur soul
I'm removing this from my watch history.
0:15 no wonder he’s in debt
No
You all need to admit if this song isn't that bad
Yo all seats recline😭
Ghost writer
I'ma be honest that one .. big traaaaash
Bro he’s got noodle hair 😭
Petition to make this the most disliked rap video on youtube.
This go hard, y’all just hating cause it’s Jake Paul
trash
England is my city
Im new to this whole yt rap scheme, and this is my view on KSI and Jake as far as music goes: This and Fresh outta London are jakes only good songs, but they bang. KSI i feel is more consistent with good music, but he only had one song that really slapped, and that was Cap. his 2nd best id either say is lighter or Houdini. But over all, id have to say KSI is a bit better. just my opinion 🤷‍♂️
jake paul is like that one white kid in middle school who tried so hard to be “hood”
Trash.

Ghost-Writer
"NO"
This has to be a social experiment
I like the jake paul back in 2019 or 2018 I want that jake back this one is shity😒😑
When he said. No cap. That was cringe asf
Me:It is my honor to dislike this. Girls:why? Me:law is law
Whoever thinks this proves anything about jakes ability is clearly mindless for real like this guy puts out two songs with no credibility for there being no ghost writer and they have the exact same fucking tone and sound like sit tf down, prove you can right ur own lyrics and flow and actually switch up ur Rhythm/ tone and then we can see if ur diverse as an artist or  just a one trick pony with a ghost writer.
If Jake keeps this up with his new music I will listen to him
Noooooo he’s back
Bro you let the money get to you
I'm gonna be honest. I kinda like it BUT I'm way too lazy to check if he wrote it becuase I'm pretty sure he didn't write fresh outta london so you know, ghost writer.
yep he has a ghost writter
Looks like jake wrote this one 🤢
The people who liked this video are just blind people trying to figure out how to turn off the song.
This song is fire🔥 ya'll just hating because it's Jake
He is trying a lot, be like "king"Justin fucking Bieber!
so who wrote this one?
whoever wrote this song for jake did well
This is so hot yo good man and Jake bout to get that other one coming up and is gonna be better gonna be a big banger like he sead the other on is gone be better
Jake paul the type of dude to look up and down before crossing the street
Is it just me or does the beginning sound like the song Byrd compare the 2
This kinda slaps
Nice beat though
That's lite
That's lite
damn, desiigner really carrying him
Waiting for ksi to give a reaction 😂😂
Boring
great song love al the music he made.
trash
You know it’s a good song when Jake says “no cap” in the first ten seconds
I like it when the beat drops 😛
Read my name
seeing silento’s bussy was better than watching 0:03 seconds of this song
Is he trying to be the white Drake?
Hey Cody Ko 👆
👁👄👁
Ghostrider
Wow, how do you mute this?
2020 has Jake Paul’s music hitting different 🔥
how is Jake Paul actually good at this
god's plan
Only reason why Jake's got more views is because JJ uploaded on GRM if it was on his main game over jakey boy
Am I the only one who like now likes Jake Paul’s songs cause they fire 🔥 ?
Last song was better
No me
KSI fan need to stfu fr this fire

When a white kid eats the travis Scott meal

If I could find someone that was half of the lady that you are and be blessed enough to love and be loved and make love I would be highly blessed and thank the good Lord each and every day
Flow like kinda same
When the white kid gets the prescription pills
When she says to eat the Travis Scott meal
A yojana russett's we glad very interesting you oh schedule westy for me FBI bro that was insane
Bro I. Haven’t  Watch jake  Sense 2018 I can’t watch him no more because he changed weird
I meeeeaaaaaan......
He used to be every 2nd graders singer  now kids actually look up to him
He ate one Travis Scott meal and did this
MJ took it personal and boxed jake Paul after this video
this would be good if the video wasn’t so cringe.
🔥
No way he wrote this but.....
I thought that I was hearing a bunch of people getting their intestines ripped out from their eye sockets but then I realized it was just Jake’s new song.
Who ever wrote this spazzed 😂😂😂
God i hates these guys
imagine trafficking n gettin away w it .
Pause at 20 secs lmao 00:20
Am I the only one who is starting to think his ghost writer is okay
Damn. This is embarrassing.
The song is named after how many ghosts writers he has.
I miss the old jake
Who’s better at rapping?  Anyone else: breathe Jake Paul: summon the seventh sun.
This song fire on mute 🤔
When a white kid eats the Travis Scott meal
ghost writer - 23
His new songs are way better then his old ones
He probably does have ghost writers
anyone getting vibez - dababy vibe. hmm...
I can already see it Jake: KSI songs keep getting worse JJ: talk to me when you write your own songs Everybody: just fight already
Boi please.
Wow nice! Said no one
Since when did jake start smoking
He didnt write it did he?
Even though he uses autotune. Its still sounds alright
Please give up
Its so hard to sing along.
Trash
I mean this song is good, but it sounds like the last one, so can he be creative?
Am I the only one that likes Jake Paul’s new songs - noooo capppp
I like the seats that recline. So does my neighbor. So does my grandma. So does everybody on fucking earth. Who doesn't like or have reclining seats who made him think he's special
ᴅᴇᴀʀ ᴛʜᴇ 1% ᴡʜᴏs ʀᴇᴀᴅɪɴɢ ᴛʜɪs, ɢᴏᴅ ʙʟᴇss ʏᴏᴜ, sᴛᴀʏ sᴀғᴇ ᴀɴᴅ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ᴀ ᴡᴏɴᴅᴇʀғᴜʟ ᴅᴀʏ🦋✨
Bruh someones  been eatin too many Travis Scott Meals!!!!!
What kind of song even is this
There's a way to listen to the music just turn down your volume and enjoy the silence. Honestly the music could've been good if it wasn't made by jack Nicolas and long-term memory loss paul.
This is ass
🤮🤮🤮🤮
this song is fire jake win the fight tomorrow
WAP,  REVERSE,,,,, YOU ALL PERVS...
absolute cringe how this is even on trending
Just quit bro
Jake say anything to me man
Jake Paul: “I like two at a time...” Alyssa violet:👁👄👁 Tessa Brookes👁👄👁 Tana Mongeau👁👄👁
Jake paul is the type of guy to put a ruler under his pillow to see how much he slept
old jakepaul is back
guys coming back
I cannot speak for everyone but, if this song was under a different artist my view is that people would like it more. The song is good. People seem to have an issue with the artist. His team should consider working with a psychologist. Specially a social psychologist, who could work with his management team to help change his public perception.  He could have a very promising career.
Just NO
Nause
Did we add our friend who went bar for bar with you, in the Spotify credits?
Who love Jack Paul Like my comment Please ❤❤❤
It's funny how he thinks KSI has bad music when he has only had two popular songs but they had ghost writers on both and KSI is topping the charts in the U.K. I hope Ksi knocks Jake out first round.
When Jake Paul meets 21 savage once...
Is it me or is jake makin good songs all of a sudden
In all fairness, nothing can be worse than its everyday bro
What’s better   like : jake Paul’s song Comment: moseys xxl freestyle
This song is so bad and obviously ghost written. But I do thank him though, the cancer in my lungs killed itself as soon as I pressed the play button

I’m only head to dislike
I wonder who wrote this one for you Jake
He wants to be black SO bad.
You cannot compare yourself to Jordan. What the hell are you thinking? Also Miley Cyrus did this already. Get over yourself and do something with your fame and money besides setting a bad example.
England is still a city.

Jesus is the only way. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
😐😶🤐

Mike: Did u write this song                                   Jake: Yes but with one friends
If this song had a better beat bro this song would be bomb
replay value is insane
There is people who can admit this song is fire and then there are haters🥱
I like it!
This fucking year keeps getting better and better
It’s just him copying black people and culture 😭😭 without any acknowledgement ✨
JJJOEY
Your music is sooooooo bad . Every time I Wake up I vomik seeing you
fire
Oh I forgot It’s 2020..
Wow, he really did just upload this absolute stinker on 9/11. What a horrible person, how can anyone look up to him. The positivity of his influence can be represented by -|x| and his intelligence can be expressed by the square root of the positivity of his influence.
Broooo this song is LIT 🔥
Get rid of it     _please_
Twat
JAIL😂
Dick Paul
He copied Sheff G’s flow!
The Haters really are punching the air right now in the comments lmao
Umm why isn't it that bad, he just needs to work on his lyrics but he has the voice
MJ took this personally
Jake PuaL?   edit: sorry hes SOOO Irrelevant i MISSPELLED the name 🤡🤡🤡
It's the racist accents for me
🔥😮🔥
He's a millionaire and can't make the green screen look good!
Booooo who tf likes this🤮👎🏽🤦🏽‍♀️😐🤔
Imagine if this didn't have ghostwriters
Who’s Better  Like = The Air  Save to camera roll = Jake
Better than every day bro
—— Does Jake Paul actually think that this is good?  Or did he release this as a joke?
Ghost writers🤦‍♂️
Jake Paul changed his personality
2:06 is the best part of the song
Kids got lot better in rapping now..
This song is great...it literally scared the rodents living right under the couch.😂
Fact this song was also made by desiigner
Sounds better on mute
His new songs are actually pretty good
Who’s better like 69.                                         Comment jake paul
Painful youtube favoritism
This is how many times jake said 23
Am I the only one who like this?
He should have stick with vlogging
The money really got to him lmaoo!!!!!
All I can say is that this is very bad... very bad
Complete fire..... the hype of 2020-2021
and unfortunately hes still trying to make music.
Didn’t he get arrested by the feds for illegal gun possession?
Pretty decent ngl
this song is like he last song
I predict dead of OD by 33!
They look like they should be brothers
no never ever will this be good music
This song sounds exactly like blue face out of beat
rip off 22 by taylor swift
Best caption wins🗑
Keep it up jake it was 🔥

Jake is trying to go for the 2018 pewdiepie look
This was actually decent.
Ew lmao
Who is better? LIKE for Jake Paul. COMMENT for Pewdiepie.
1:29 does he like the money bag going up his butt or?
I dislike this human
I loved it so much❤️
Remember when Jake Paul used to be on the Disney Channel
man there’s no way her wrote this
I thought he was caught up with sex trafficking I’m confused
This is literally three verses of material, if you’re being kind to it. No section changes throughout the entire thing too. Pretty sad in terms of lyrical and musical content.
Im starting to like his new songs...
y’all keep hating on the music and on him in general but you’ll never be as successful as him and he’s still at the top after 5 years 🤷‍♂️ can’t argue with facts
The random person,,,''''who liked my Comments 😭😭 I pray '''' may your and your parents live more than 100 years 🙏🙏
I just came to dislike this. Bye.
dis hard idc 💚
I’d never thought I’d say this but I like his flow...
The dislikes are straight bs what y’all hatin on??
All oceans have froze because this is the opposite of fire
this wasnt good. back to your OFC days i see. quit the clown act. literally.
For best experience, set volume to 0%
Does nobody else notice that he has almost the same amount of like as dislikes.......like dang that’s tough!  😳😳😟😨🤭😶🤯
Ur rich we get it
Jake who wrote song
Man actually put on the news headline: “...accused of ghost writers” bro I’ve seen who the ghost writers are. This guy think he can cover up his tracks. Whata clown. For those who like it this song, this wasn’t by him.
come to brazil
Covid 19 left the chat
This man really rhymed everything with the ime , ine or ised
Yall got this !! get more dislikes than likes👍🏽💕
So you like Pewds chair?

Check out Dana Stevens: white church wake up were enslaving God chosen on YouTube this is a white man telling truth ⏳
Tydus and trav and cor and ryry watching like 🧿👄🧿

love how its the same 10 words the whole song. talking about some girl ruining the vibes and reclining seats
This song is good.
The other songs way better
Did anyone else pay attention to the news seens
It was the crooked Dougie for me
A person can’t get mad that he is a performer that is what he is a performer with a gimmick that has someone or people write his/her material,a artist does all on his own or with the group members with a occasional outside influence
me just breathing air sounded better than this
Well 6/9 finally got competition 😂😂😂
why he trying to steal lil baby’s flow??
Tbh the song ain’t that bad
Jake Paul video on Trending? Wut in tarnation
Make this the most liked comment
Technically KSIs song is doing better

Everyone: Hating on Jake His song writers: Who is this Uncultured swine. I've never met this man in my life.

I never thought I’d see Jake Paul smoking a blunt...crazy
He needs to take bulls shirt off and stop disrespecting my city.
All of a sudden I think LeBron is better than Jordan now
The amount of dislikes 😂
The beat goes crazy! But the lyrics ehh
Guys, let's just have him age restrict the video, then it won't have as many views.
Lil baby copycat

Y’all a bunch of haters 😂
If you find this comment, have a wonderful day!
Apparently YouTube won’t let me use the word “aids” in a comment, so let me just say I wish that this man becomes infected with the human immunodeficiency virus very soon.
If the FBI convicted jake Paul the world would be a better place
•When you get vaccinated your entire life•
If you are a republican, you're probably a butt plug.
This made Lil Moseys freestyle look like a masterpiece
🔥
oh "god" why did i click on this embarrassing bullshit
Kinda sounds like kanye...
Jake make your own song
He better be paying his ghost writer a lot of money for helping him...
Whiteboy wasted
Better than usual
JAKE is SOOOOO cool did you see that blunt omg😫🙄*Terrible Content* I miss his old unique content, now he just does what everyone else does expecting to grow in popularity. *Insane Cringe*
its crazy how jake paul can smoke weed and be on the trending page but weedtubers get their accounts deleted for just taking and smoking having a chill time
This is literally the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life!

Guys, I'm Brasilian and I'm learning English. I'd love if you guys can help me to improve me English. This is my instagram: @jf_ribeiro99 My snapchat: @jfribeiro74
You can really enjoy his music if you bump the volume to 0. Anyway hire a better editor and a vfx artist those greens are killing me. Instead of using templates let them make one!

23 is better than fresh out of London
Why would these lyrics slap if it would be done by any other rapper
I just threw up in my mouth looking at his face
It’s literally the same song as fresh outta London but with a new name
In 1 day.

They should have kept him in jail longer
Jake is too broke he has a full bag full of coal that’s how toxic he’s been
The best way to listen to this song Is no audio
How much did ghost writers make this time?
That girl in the car is a man. Jake 🌈
1:31 Dancing like mr krabs was in that one episode where he had to convince squidward he wasn't a robot.
Never thought I’ll see a white boi like him smoke lol
Now they borthers 😂
What gender are you?     Like: Toaster  Comment: *other*
Who's writing for Jake. I wanna know
"I got the feds watching"- whitest guy I know

A other ghostwriter
No matter what your view on him is , yur view itself is giving him money
*Watches video, turns to terminator*  "...are we gonna make it, humans?"
This song is something else       Trash
Who else misses how YouTube used to be after hearing this garbage
Imagine having people who just click on the vid just to dislike
Somebody get shaq
I think this song is lowkey fire but the seats recline in regular Benz too
He's got a Ghost writer. Trash 🗑️

You are a shadow of what KSI is my dude... JJ has made multiple genre tracks and albums. You made nothing.. nothing.. nada.. zero.
Where is his real hairline
Why the hell are u smoking🤡
Probably got a ghost writer like fresh out of London
KSI is losing
The amount af dislikes on the video is insane this song and fresh atta are so good keep up the work
Just came here to watch the two ads YouTube picked to show before this video.
His new song are lit but that's cause he has a ghost writer
KSI, what are the monthly views

Damm I luv the ksi army were jus way to strong the dislikes on here is Craz

Where have u been
Accusing him of ghost writers is giving him too much credit
Nice
Bruh this song is low key good
I feel like this song is better on mute
Couldnt come up with anything original so just copying the rest of the mumble rappers out there. It's really sad this is considered music. It's a symptom of a failing society.
His songs are amazing now
Which ones batter fresh outta London or Jake paul - 23
people really just disliking the song cuz its jake paul. just close your eyes, listen to it. it sounds pretty good ngl
My car seat reclines... does that mean you like 2006 1.2 corsa’s?
It's Funny How The Hating comments came 24 hours after the real comments 😂😂
Who tf told him he look mixed ?
Would hit different if he gave his ghost writers props
A future millionaire will like this
this is garbage
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this
I can Guarantee he didnt write this
pov: those cars are cheap  car people: $600,000 is cheap to u?
Instead of saying I like the seats that recline he should have said I only smoke for the clout
MAKE A NEW TEAM 10
Bra Why you all be hating because he doing good songs bra look at one of if latest videos and it shows that he writes his own music and ksi doesn't I'm just saying I ain't his biggest fan but you can't lie he has been doing good with his music much better than ksi recently

The real question is, does Paul look through the comments?!  🤯🤘🏻
No
Why would you make a music video flexing everything you got
That global warming thing genuinely made me laugh a lil
People out here hating cause y’all mad that he getting better I fw this heavy ion care what y’all say “AYE JAKE PAUL I FW THIS NEW VERSION OF YOU”
When your like to dislike ratio is this close to being equal, it's a sign that you should stop making videos
He is so different now that he is older
His flow is good but he should add more music pauses and make more verses with chorus in between
I’m sorry but nah
0:26 jake rejected the second girl in the car
How about 24 ummm Kobe rip brother
Yikes
More ghost Riders haha
He definitely has ghost writers whether he is a part of writing it at all is the question! I bet he sits around with other people and they help him with the flow of it and he says words and they make the rap around it and to him it feels like he wrote it.
Do a song about you love your fans
no
Me clicks on video   Me dislikes   Me clicks on KSI video
which ghost writers this time?
I enjoyed this
Why is he still making music? Isn't team ten dead?
It actually good sadly
dickhead
Idk why y’all hating on him y’all just can’t accept the fact that he really changed and has better flow than KSI most of the times

This kid has a ghost writer
Jake paul - writing his song by himself          Ksi - he has a ghost writer while he has 10 people each song helping him write his song                                                           The only reason ksi called out jake Paul was because he was irrelevant and no one cared about him
This song hits different on mute

Fresh out of London is better.

Lol these guys and the people who support em is the reason the world is in the state it’s in 😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️😷
🤢🤮
This song so fire on mute 🔥🔥
“He” could only come up with 1 minute 30 seconds of lyrics that’s a yikes, and he repeated himself like 69 times.
“Mom can we have 21 by Polo G” “We have that at home...” 21 at home:
0:27 his voice is copying Drake

Who wrote this song? And bte is that designer in the back round

When Miley does 23 better
1 he didn’t write it  2 he’s a criminal
Did anyone notice 1:53 ?
Lit
These songs are how he flexes his money
This guy doesn’t write his own songs
From here on out no one is aloud to comment anything except “this song hits different on mute”
Ghostwriter for sure
No❤️
ew ❤️
Why is this good??????😕🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
Everyone: Praying to god that they get lots of likes on their comment        Also Me:Trying to do the same thing
Auto tune just doesn’t help anything

0:08 I cringed so hard I had to dislike the vid

The thing is ive hated this guy forever and i can at least admit his last 2 songs have been heat
He probably didn’t write this either
Y does this have 4million views?
this guy is still relevant?
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER SONG THIS IS LITTT
Ngl this is better then fresh out of London

I’m a KSI fan, lets be honest he jus chillin

The reason I clicked on this just to be ahead before Ksi reacts
Who wrote this one

When’s your fight
Why is this kinda good
This song is GREAT on full blast       I may be def, but...
Ghost writer checkkkkk
decent like every other youtube rapper
Jake Paul the type of person to copy off the smart kid
That was fire, but is it me or did jake become more cute, and I haven't seen him in a while, like I forgot he existed but  the song is fire putting that in my playlist
Jake Paul: good song  That means...       Ghost writer
Your the worst
No way Jake Paul wrote this
He deleting the comments 😭
mans really think he doesn't have a ghostwriter with his it was me and my 1 friend lookin ass
If he wrote this song I will actually cut my tongue out
See Jake Paul has a habit of reviling his ghost writers   Fresh out of London: Designer  23:log in pool
Can’t even believe that someone like this makes more money than smart, hardworking educated people. And he thinks he’s the stuff.
Bad
Fireeee
Jake I know you didn’t write this
Y’all all hating when he starts doin good lmaooo
Ksi’s songs are way better then this trash
Best song of 2020

Lmao he got the numbers right👏
DISGUSTING
I’ve listen to this song 43 times already it’s so good
he doesnt write his music... thats why "its so good"
Jake Paul is dumb
what a disgrace
I loved that part at 2:06
0:07 that “no cap” was very cringeworthy
if you listen closely you can hear ksi laughing in the distance
he really makin hits now like fuckin damn bro. go up.
On Spotify the song credits has no one as a writer, no one as a producer and Jake as a performer, where’s your name jake, where’s your name on the writers list lmao
This is the most biggest  money flex on humanity.
No I only atched this to dislike and comment
Jake paul changed
No cap tho this isn’t that bad 😩
The video already has so much dislikes let's go
23 making a fool of every1 since 2300 months
the song lowkey go up
Trash
Good song but we all know he didn’t write this 😂
you should make a video of the process of you making the song.
Its sounds like he’s saying a lot but nothing is actually understandable or audible
It sounds the same to fresh out of London
Was weed in the big money bag💰
Came here just to leave a dislike. Have great day.
I bet his ghost writer is in the bag of money
Ppl Love this low vibrational shxt.  Eat it up kids. That's what they want. Might as well be a guud cid & give it to em💁🏾💀
He needs to bump up the bass the crazy and it would be amazing
This is bad 🤢
When u order dababy If wish:
🎉
God bless everyone hope you have a good

I Have To Be 100% Honest. 2:06 Was Straight Fire🔥🔥
Who’s the ghost writer this time?
Jake paul smokes weed?
I’m from Chicago and this is very disrespectful to Michael Jordan
Wth this gained like 2mil views in 3 hours
Fire
Whoever is writing Jakes songs deserves 7 raises
He is the opposite of hip hop culture
Y’all some haters man

Didn't he go to jail or something?
Irrelevant!
Jake the type of guy to wash his hands after taking a shower
“Thanks 2020”
Interviewers: so Jake did u write this song  Jake: the law requires me to say *yes*

I'm gonna be honest, i didn't like his old songs but ngl this beat is actually 🔥
No.
He had so many ghost writers that he could make haunted house
i live in Ohio
I hope this kid burns in hell
Kinda ironic how he makes fun of what you’re all gonna try and roast him about in the video but you still do it anyway bruh
Yep! The brother of the man that made fun of a man who killed him self.
ganda merda
fan
Booo
Jake Paul's ghost writer: I think I should start rapping as well.
Tom Macdonald team write the song. Thank you
I’m your biggest
Tom Macdonald team write the song. Thank you
KSI gotta step up his game
Jake was trash at rapping Before and then he got Better Dam keep up the good work Bro
Your brother is stupidly funny 😂😂😂😂
Wtf this is actually good 😳
I’m a jake Paul hater but this is heat
“And I took it personally” - Jordan after seeing his name dragged through the mud with this song
What the heck was that dribble
Why he got pubes on his face
Sadly this is acually good
When is he going to stop hiding his receding hair line? Notice how he combs his hair forward to hide it. Dude is shedding worse than a Golden Retriever! 🤣
Calling this song garbage would be an insult to garbage
Never saw him on the news ever since he said the n-word but yet he talking about being on the news😑
Did designer write this one too 😂😂😂
I was waiting for that "England is my city" line tbh
I hope you're paying your ghostwriter well for these because they're big improvements
This hits different on mute bro!
He pinned the only comment that said his song is good.
He snapped
Ok
Sounds like a DDG song 🤔
So was that money on the top of the car what he looted?
We need Tom MacDonald to say something about these two bro 🗑
ghost writers have done him well
Ur gay styl
Nice song that you didn’t write
Jake paul just level up from assh*le to cool now
How you feel like jordan
Funny, I was reading an article on causes for brain cancer and it linked me to here....
Y'all haters just shut up like lol

The dislikes are gonna overcome the likes
That was just a whole ass "What?" Moment
Why tho 😶
Bruh
It used to be kid friendly now I adult friendly
This song fire
I wasted 28 seconds of show to just cringe to this
So who’s writing these songs cuz it’s a bop
Jake's best song
It’s a shame how anybody can be a rapper nowadays. I feel bad for all you kids who grow up listening to this trash
Does anyone know what the outfit at 0:35 is?
23 is the amounts of gallons of bleach imma drink after watching this
Hey! Jesus loves you.
Okay ngl this is fire 🔥

these boysman
A good beat ruined by a trash rapper

Just here for comments 🙃
Road to second-most disliked video in history.
Did you love the last music video or this music video
jake are you having your midlife crisis?
Y'all hating and still watching his videos..that's why most of y'all won't make it in life
**gags in normal person**
I was seeing what was on trending now i gotta find bleach
He went bar for bar with his friends to make this one too
Jake is so savage he loots stores in Arizona xD
This. Is. Shite.
Once u here his first good song u realise the songs get boring because they sound the same
2020 has just reached a whole different level of insanity 😳 Idiocracy the movie has become reality and this is the Theme Tune!
2 minutes and 6 seconds of my life gone.

Im vibing
I thought this was gonna be better than all of his music, I was wrong 23 times again 🤣🤣

I feel bad fo MJ
For how many 10 Yos that are his loyal fans this song is, well a but more pg 13
He definitely wrote this himself
Jakey and his grill need to hit up speech therapy
I bet everyone who listened to this unironically is a 8 year old retard
I though Machine Gun Kelley had tats.
Wack....
Just waiting for KSI to react to this and just wonder WTAF is this
Who else only here to dislike and leave?
as much as i dislike jake , last two tracks ain’t been bad ..
I got goosebumps
23 = how many ghostwriters jakes got
And his face just makes you wanna punch it
literally the same as the last song, trash and most likely written by someone else
Why is this in my recommended
Kids literally subscribed to Jake just to dislike his videos. Sad.
When his 10 year old fans finally grow up, this guy is finished fr.
When he said haters I said ok bye 👋
Bro this shii bang!!!
This guys flow is all the same every song
Man he did just as good as the catch me outside girl
Came just to dislike
This song sons better off the app
I did my part and disliked the video
Dang. 30’s gonna hit him hard if this is what he looks like at just 23.
THIS IS HARD!
Moment of silence for all those who’ll see this in their recommendations in 5 years
bruh that money is fak.... aim sori..
Jake what is that kiss 1.35
Good song, but credit the actual writers
Wack🥴🤢
Let’s get him 100K DISLIKES 🤬 Like - YES Comment - No
It really annoys me that people say he has a ghost writer, but have absolutely no proof whatsoever.
No..no Jake I fully believe you wrote this song that's apparent
My tinnitus sounds better than this.
OK I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.. 1. Is the first bit of him stealing the giant money bag referring to him raiding in Arizona?? 2. Your audience is young.. and your smoking A LOT in this video... that's gonna make the 9 year olds think it's fine, 3. Ok... COOL WE GET IT YOU LIKE SEATS THAT RECLINE!!  (Yea ik those weren't ALL questions,)
Trash stick to making videos music is terrible
songs actually fire stop the cap yall
Who else waiting on KSI reaction
Breaking: this song sounds 10x better at 1.5x speed  On mute Read my name
This bangs if Jake wrote this himself he gonna be going places
Tf is this, Jake?
23 is the amount of active brain cells that jake has left
THE GAY BOYS MADE A SONG TOGETHER
How old Are u
We gotta pump these dislikes up
I like your music it slaps

The chance you wrote this is the same as your odds of beating KSI
🤐😵
The beginning🤣🤣🤣
I stg at least over half the lyrics were the same verse

This song is class on mute
23 was already made . Would of been better as a remix 🤷‍♀️ just sayin 💯

It's just weak, like what's to say here.
This goes off no cap
Jake paul is the world's greatest rapper (puns and sarcasm intended)
Cold song 🥶
This new kill jasper song is sick since he wrote it after all
You forgot the s in the s Beginning of hit
He tells everyone he likes em 2 at a time. Pretty sure this fker lasts barely 1.5min with Viagra

Black friends.

He is like annoying aunties from dad side of fam
This song is so bad my airpods blew up
He went from albino white to light skinned black wtf

Auto tuned much...
I can’t follow the community guidelines and keep my comment respectful when this song disrespected my ears and disrespected my time for two minutes
His brother probably wrote the song
Why does this song sound like his last one LOL

Why does this song sound like dababy-VIBEZ?
Haters be swithcin up real quick
You know you at an all time low when you sound like a btec ricegum

What is he 5'4??  Lol     Miley wore the jersey.. now he does .  Jordan must be so let down .
Like si eres español
Difference between Jake Paul and KSI. Jake makes ‘you tube music’ and it just a YouTube who makes music.  KSI make actual music and is actually a proper artist.
🔥🔥🔥
I think my ears are bleeding anyone else ?
He have pinned the only comment which says this song is good 😂
A like iss
Yessirrr
Headache.
Who wrote the song jake 😂😂
He did everything right except for do everything right
The only good thing is the beat
I like 🍆
How much for your ghost writer this time ?
Jakes music is low key fire
Who's still letting Jake make music though? Bro give it up 🙅‍♂️🚮
Dude just cause you got mo friends no need to make songs to get friends
Y’all do know that he works with designer and other dudes that write his songs right? Smh the only song HE made was everyday bro and y’all know how that went
Eh it aint to bad, at least I can listen to it without cringing
This was a waste of the beat that beat cold asf 🥺
I'm so salty I am going to have to subscribe
Let him do a freestyle video. Then all you will know he's the real deal😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
please stop it's embarrassing
Everyone dislike
This man was done with YouTube now he’s back cos this the thing that made him😂
Looks like a rough neighborhood
Ew
What's up with the Pauls and maths.
Another song another ghost writer
Jake Paul do you remember the killer clowns that Attacked you a long time ago they came back.
This song hits different on mute
People just watching these now to see of his ghost writer has improved
The 90k dislikes are all those still claiming ghostwriting :^
Aight let’s see his monthly listeners
Just came here to say  KSI
Use to be a kids chanel
Would you rather hear Jake songs or 69 songs?
This was actually heat y’all can’t even lie
This song is so fucking good
Super lame
Jake somebody recently made a Diss track about which pretty hard you should go check it out his name is void
Trash
People hating but jake really dope..
Hey, let's make a music video for more clout!
He has a good voice but he’s just wasting it
Jake Paul is the type of guy to look up and down before crossing the road
Ngl this song proves how bad his music is when he doesn’t write it
lol stop it
I've been listening to it for two days
i forgot he existed..
I wonder who wrote this one
This is actually good.
Claim your “here before a million views” ticket here
WTF just stop
He spent more money on auto tune then this song will make
Bich
This is trash as usual
People dead ass out here thinking he wrote this 💀💀💀
Just wanted to let you know that I had no legs, no arms , I was actually just a spirit but god sent me to earth To dislike this video and turn off this video from a 51year old fan’s phone that was going to be shown to his grandchildren to prevent them all having simultaneous strokes and dying  Man this like to dislike ratio is Just lovely
I gave u like 20 views ur welcome great song too man
Tekashi69 is more talented than you, BRO.
Who did he pay to write these lyrics?
Jesus   is coming back soon. He loves you dearly and calls for you to come back home to Him! that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  He calls for repentance and belief in the Gospel. It’s time to fully surrender to Christ. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well
Did he even have a verse? All I heard was the hook for 2 minutes.
Maxx Season Is Approaching...
oh look another song about Jake bragging about his networth
So no ones talking about how this song sounds very similar to his last one?
I miss his old content with the original team 10🤧
who here with his song on mute ?
Well done to you ghost writers!
Music isn’t for everyone...
I LIKE OLD JAKE PAUL
Eh it’s just soundcloud rap with a budget
It’s bad
Since when he knows how to rap tf
bruh why does this guy still do music, it’s crap
Damn
Jake bro you are bringing the fire again
This is fireeeeeee ! Anyone agree ? 🔥🔥
This song bangs on mute
Lmao this idiot think using the same style as his last song will work again   Clearly his ghostwriter isn't involved because this one is absolute DOG
Wow. It it actually good
Just me who found it cringey af when he said no cap?
Dope song man keep it up
Your so dead just accept it
At this point cringe is an understatement.
I mean the lyrics are crap but the delivery is great tbh
💥💥💥💥💥
I guess the hobo look is in?
starting to up the game Jake vibin on this
Ghost writer making bangers
Never thought I would say this but the song is valid my question is did he write this?
Ayyyyy 90 thousandth dislike
Damn best rapper on YouTube better than YouTube
“Nobody likes you when you’re 23”
Fire song 🔥🔥🔥
Such a neek
Didn't this nigga say that this would be better than fresh out of london ? It sounds like an auto generated rap. Jakes delusional AF.  Calling himself a lyricist 🤦‍♂️. He literally told on Logan's podcast that he and one more guy did fresh out of london and in credit list on spotify only jakes name is there. At least he got the name of the song right by mentioning that there are 23 writers behind this song. Rating: 4/10. For fresh out of london it's 6.6/10. Lyrics are trash, his ghost writer should get downpaid big time.
what is this..
Alr guys lets change the like and disk like ratio and make him have more dislikes than likes
Every one in these comments are sum hater even if he didn't write it he delivers it good
What an inspiration! Really screams humble to me.
Stop with the roast comments !     I can't like them all
The lyrics are actually good
This lame still makes videos 😑
this is fire let's be honest
lmfao
Garbage
So much garbage on youtube...
This was actually really good tho
This song too hard
Reading the comments is better than listening to the song💀💀
It's stupid but it's a good song ngl 😆
As a MASSIVE KSI fan I have to say this is better then some of KSIs newer music well done jakes ghost writer you’ve Done well
Song hit different when it's on mute.
0:56 We stick to something that actually works ogcodes .club
Over Auto tuned and they’re aren’t even his lyrics. This boy sh*t
Whoever reads this comment have a great day.
I like it. I think it was 🔥 keep up the good work. Let haters be haters. Who cares what people say. Do you boo. 100🔥
fire❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bank accouter:  How much you want for your loan?  Jake: Yes
The only reason I clicked on this was for the dislike
KSI'S SONGS KEEP GETTING WORSE?? NOW THATS THE CAP
Go to spotify and look at the credits. Look at the writers.. Now go to a ksi song and do the same.
And this song sounds offly familiar the flow of one of Lil baby’s songs smh
You mumble harder than a baby learning to speak and the beat sounds like the baby trying to make its breakfast
*imagine being 23 and still being ugly as fuck how sad.. his glow ups really do keep passing him-*
I’d tap 🤤
Why is this in my recommended?
He had one verse and called it a song
Editors: How much auto tune you want  Jake: Yes
2020 was already bad enough man
People aren't mad for no reason. There mad cause you aren't helping with the corona virus situation.
Jake Paul lowkey becoming my favorite youtuber , id lowkey listen to an album
He took a step back on this one
I need that Marlboro shirt tho.
Beautifully ghost written

Who else was here when he wasn’t rich I looked at this and was like wow he’s 23!😭😊
Blow you up and steal stufff and take your girls and give them to other guys
I am following Jake Paul again because of his recent songs..
“Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire” “good luck” 💸
if you think this is good, it’s even better on mute.
Designer album coming soon voice by jake paul

I came to watch a song but I only hear screams am I in the right place? I came to watch someone sing and all I hear is a ticktocker screaming
This is actually decent
Why is this trending
This is a banger bruh good sing jake you got this
It is so sad that ksi fans are ruineing the comments. Just accept the fact that this is a good song, and that he wrote it.
23 being the about of ghosts writers he’s employed
Are you still Bernie’s best Friend?💀
the paul brothers are cancer
23 Million Dollars?!
Man, I saw that rope at the beginning of this video and the only thing I could think of was that poor man who hung himself in the forest. Do you remember your brother showing us that? Pepperidge farms remembers.
2020 has been rough enough already - just stop it
Yesss
This makes "Fresh Outta London" sound good
Make this have more dislikes than likes please
This song is good but its just the person who raps it
favorite part bout this is that the people hyping him up think saying he didnt write it will change anyone's mind...bars still trash
This is fire
I thought he was still arrested
Designer going hard in this
Jake Paul just stole NAV’s flow
This is more palatable than I ever expected.
Even if he didn’t write this it’s still fire asf. The beats this dudes cooking up is next level!
GUYS STOP HATING ON JAKE IN THE COMMENTS!! I CAN’T LIKE THEM ALL
This is so far the best song of JP!
GHOST WRITERRRRRRRR

These brothers are still relevant?
Who’s the ghost writer this time 🤔
Lowkey got a little bit of ddg flow

Stop making music you’re making innocent people deaf
I clicked for the comments, I muted the "song"
Lol the last time I watched jake paul was in 2017
Interviewer: So Jake, did you write this song?  Jake: Well me and my friend went bar to bar.
Is it just me  or I had no idea/cared that this came out
Why are y’all hating on this he’s rapping like any other rapper in this generation
Wonder who wrote this song

This is a really Catchy song.
🔥
The only positive comment... is the one that gets pinned
0:04 was my fav part.
🔥
Fresh outta london2.0
This song is fire, when it’s muted
Jake Paul looks like the cousin your mom tells you to stay away from.
This song reminds of a 9 year old white kid who listened to one Eminem song and thinks they know how to rap.
Bunu Türk arkadaslarim için soyluyorum; aga bunlar hala parayla gosteris yapmaktan bikmadi mi ?
Can this guy just understand that his career is as dead leafy
Why are you still a thing?
I have been a fan for 3 years and this song is 🔥
Me encantaria que comente este video auromplay

Whack af
Imagine having a ghost wrighter
I love the song
Instead of making people happy this man Jake paul wanna make people commit suicide

The people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this
Jake starting to hang with black people and suddenly his music gets better 👀👀
Is it me who thinks this is the same song as FRESH OUT OF LONDON
When he saided no cap.. I said yes ok. 😂 (Just a joke lol)
Are we all just gonna forget about how he exploited his child fan base and scammed them
he's trying to beat youtube rewind 2018's dislike record, and honestly...its working
Ksi is better
Elon won’t send you to space your ghost writer can’t even make good music
All y’all hating just because it’s Jake if it was anyone else you’d be thinking this a banger which it is
I fucking love Jake Paul omg
is 23 his IQ???....or is that being generous ha
Meh, I’ve heard better
Such boring songs omg ....
Ghost writer has alot of material to make his childish haters cry and its halrious it produces good music and I'm sold to it 😂😂😂
We all know he has a ghost writer he sucked so bad then get so much better lmao that’s suspicious
This is low key fire 🔥
Y'all stop hating this song is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥

"How am I 23 sitting on 23? I feel like Jordan the meme where he crying"
Hahaha yea you ugly
once this dude becomes 30 his "fame" will collapse faster then the stock market crash in 1929
This just proves that good music is dead. Feel free to delete this comment Jake 😘
Who’s turn was it to make it this time? Travis or who
Vibe is dope, the chorus is good but need to slow it down and add some more bars in the middle. Way too short bruh sounds like a ringtone.
ghost written????
Who ever dislike is Jealous of Jake Paul rap
even if he is getting help you gotta rate his flow
At least KSI has different art styles for his music video. While Jake only sings with expensive things in the background
This gave me Miley Cyrus vibes 🥴
It would be good if he actually made the song
I bet he had a ghost writer
The feds are after ur manager
Imagine starring your brother
As soon as the video started i heard these clowns do a foreign accent already disliked lmaoooo
The feds are after ur manager

Jake looks like a young santa

🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Why is this actually kinda good......
He's just blinded by ego and isn't even happy, no matter how much material things he boasts about, we can see how insecure he really is.
terrible! 😀

23 is the amount of ppl that wrote this song
The bass sounds like it was produced in a toilet.
Hopefully he wrote this himself

Eeek. The green screen at 0:30! With that much money you could light your sets better?
Sausage fest

Does he even know his target audience are literal embryos? This is just over dumb.  Jake's a lobotomite and you can't argue a bit about it, because it's clear.
Mfs dissing on dude but y’all will never have a video or song #2 on trending str8 low life’s
Nobody likes you when you’re 23
The song is 🔥🔥🔥.       But we all know he didn't write  those song

So  trash 🗑
So who wrote this
Anyone who disliked is just a pure hater
Written by: Desiigner
terrible song but his brother's acting was decent, at least there's some talent in the family.
Idc if he has a ghost writer, this song fire !
I see what he’s trying to do. Since this song is the opposite of fire, he’s trying to help Cali
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Why is this in my recommended
this song actually hits hard
Why does he look like a white lebron james
So many people dislike him he had to feature his own brother in his song
This is The proof that 'Money isn't everything'
It sounds something anyone could create in ejay.
No one: Ksi reacting to this: Allow it fam, let’s check his Spotify listeners

Almost 2021 and people still riding the G.O.A.T's coattails to stardom!
Until jake live-streams himself writing a new song BY HIMSELF no one is going to believe that he wrote any of his past two songs....   But he won’t because he didn’t write his past two songs.
I am Russian. Please somebody explain me why everyone hates this dude?
I feel like this reminds me of Post Malone's song "White Iverson". I thought about that song during the entire video. I feel like the videos are sort of similar in way.
PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED  JAKE PAUL WOKE UP!!!???!?!?!?!?!? OMG
I wonder what erika costell is up to nowadays 🤔
Aren't you supposed to be in jail
Jake paul ur the food that gets stuck in between ur teeth

"While these rappers just run out of time, im here forever, this life's televised".🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Best bar
Jake seems like an angel if you sit him next to tekashi69 :''D I LIKE THE SONG!!
This might be the worst thing I've ever heard in my life.
"Jake Paul woke up today people are outraged" no we're just disappointed
This is so trash like fr
Here before jj disses it
i see this trending, i think, "ooh maybe it'll be good." nope. almost worse than it's everyday bro.

Jake Paul covered "Oh My · Nines · SL · Yung Fume · Tiggs Da Author"
Thai Song is actually good why is everybody against this 😂😂
I can think of all the expletive words in the world and would still sound like a compliment. Makes Friday from Rebecca Black sound like bohemian rhapsody compared to this
I’m I the only one who’s starting to like his new songs? ???
How are you back in your prime if it’s your first time being 23

This song is good, but he didnt write it😭.
Imagine being those 2 (hopefully) women he had in the video. No credit given in the description for all of 3 seconds tops between cuts. Imagine what "casting" they had to do...for that.....

He can pay for the music video but he can't pay his taxes?
Imagine this: You're enjoying a relaxing trip to New Orleans; The weather is nice, the activities are fun, and coronavirus is a thing of the past. All is calm, all is good. But then, out of the corner of your eye you see him.....    Jake Paul, trying to sell digital remasters of Everyday Bro.
I thought that I have got an illusion with number 23 but it seems is all magic! Well done. Nice song.
Bruh he doesn’t even write his own music
1 verse, and a chorus repeated 4 times. Wack.
ksi fans be crazy with 77k dislikes! get in
All I have to say is 🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥
Sounds exactly like his last song just different lyrics....

Me no English, me know Jake music bad 😂
When you put a couple black guys in your "rap" music video so it makes it look like you can actually rap.  Jake Paul logic 🤦‍♂️😂🗑

No
Am I the only one who thinks Jake Paul’s songs are a lot better
disgusting, dissing JJ in a music video of a song, he probably didn´t even wrote.
Dam jake that is a fire song, you really killed it with straight out of London and 23

Wow this wouldn't have sucked this much if didn't existed
for everyone that’s saying that he has a “ghostwriter” that doesn’t mean anything it’s how you sound with the lyrics people can ghost write for someone and the person using it can sound terrible
Why is the song called 23. Jake: ..... Reporter: it’s how many people wrote your song isn’t it. Jake: confused screaming
This is a banger

I knew this song was gonna get alot of dislikes the moment it came out just like his other songs😂good
I wonder who wrote this one
its sad how he is flexing money when he couldnt even hire one more person to be the limo driver
He has so many ghostwriters
Someone explain why Jake ain’t sitting with the drake or that’s to much?? 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾💯💯
"Haters are punching the air and accusing him of "ghost writers"." The only thing Jake wrote in the song
I head he was gay ? Liked it in the bum ?? True story
Jakes music started getting good when he stopped tryna milk kids
Lol It say that this was posted 23 hours ago lol

God bless Dr Agbonifo for his marvellous work in my life, I was diagnosed of HERPES since 2014 and I was taking my medications, I wasn't satisfied i needed to get the HERPES out of my system, I searched about some possible cure for HERPES i saw a comment about Dr Agbonifo ,how he cured HERPES with his herbal medicine, I contacted him and he guided me. I asked for solutions, he started the remedy for my health, he sent me the medicine through UPS SPEED POST. I took the medicine as prescribed by him and three weeks later i was cured from HERPES, Contact him on whatsApp +2349034749874..

As fast as I got on  here as fast I run out of here  . Never like this fool .
Song is good but you didn’t write it, so all the compliments you’re getting aint even for you my guy 🤣

This song is trash
W A C K
When its covid 19 and you have to hand sanitize your hands but only 99 percent of germs gets killed and one survives just to sing a song called 23, wears air jordans, creases them, and knows nothing about basketball.
Did he just smoke a ciggarete at 0:46
Love it❤
Rather hear this than Drake this 🔥🔥
This song 💩💩💩💩💩
Sir please- Go back to bed.
If it’s good then he didn’t write it

He did so stop
Why this man trying act like dababby 😂😂
Oh i thought i started the vid *" Memes that i forgot ever existed"* But its kinda same tho
You sure you should be burning money after you became 1 million in debt for a year and still probably are
Its fire
This is bad
Why y’all trying to bring someone down for grinding
Who is here just to see how many dislikes it'll get?
Shill
Why he lookin constipated the whole video
Came just to dislike❤️
How tf is this number two
This is what the 0.01% of germs that Lysol can’t kill looks like
It’s so similar to fresh outta London. Flow wise, beat wise. But it’s okay
Awful diarrhea
Why this sound like money man "24"
He thinks he gangsta now. I remember back in the day he was the preppiest kid I’ve ever seen
Nice ghost writer
it’s actually pretty good :)
Damn jakes ghost writer got some fuckin bars
Yoooo
This is trash
Least he seems to be having fun
disney watching this like 👁👄👁

Out of all your songs this is probably the best one
🔥🔥🔥
Legit the same as his last song
Corona helping jake out to make fire music
whats this song about???   Whatever its trashhhhhhhhh
Song is assssssssssss sounds like fresh outta London
Ksi: how many ghost writers you got  Jake: 23
Anyone else trying to find some actually positive comments about the song?

Capped kid
Whew!! So relieved when he put out  that london song I was popping tooo it...almost became a fan now this is the old jake we know..keep on making trash music...JAKE!! ksi should tutor this clown
like the previous song, this is just acceptable. and this is worst than fresh out of london, ( aun con escritores fantasmas ), jake you are a meme and only a meme, nadie en este mundo queria ser como tu ( tal vez solo por cuanto tiene pero por nada mas)
The music video was just a massive money flex and the song was a bad singing skills flex
Actually Kinda fireee
this song asss
23 premiered 23 hours ago lol
Trash😂😂
He really tried to buy a music career 😂
Put this on mute and it's a banger🔥
Why does the thumbnail look like he’s about to commit mass genocide? Also this song cringe af.
It sounds like the exact same thing for 3 minutes
Me- me and one friend
This was made 23 hours ago and it’s called 23 😂
The dude jake pinned almost has 10,300k subs impossible.
I bet people are gonna say he has hired another ghost writer. Ask yourself, perhaps Jake can actually write a decent song.
Should be 23 ghost writers
Ghostwriters lives matter!
On his latest episode he appeared on Impaulsive he spoke of how he has worked so hard at music and is such a talented musician.... 😂
Now he can finally shut up about being shadowbanned
This is the same fuckin flow as straight outta London
I didn't like his music before but now, Jake you're producing fire 🔥
Money changed you bro
I just realized what white privileged means
Jake Paul and 6IX9INE!!!!
It's so bad
is this the everyday bro remix
Who cares if he has a ghost writer lol it's trash regardless hahaha but I watched it so I guess jokes on me
1:54 Aids.
He looks like the white drake I’m dead😂😂😂😂
Fun fact:most of the people who are hating are ksi fans because he's making good music I would still say ksi has better music but he also have more experience than jake when it comes to making music
This is bad
WHY DO HIS SONGS SOUND DIFFERENT ON APPLE MUSIC. They arent mastered properly or something. His voice too low
Pretty sure Rebecca Black's laughing in her room right now
Stop trying be like the other rappers
idoooooooooo el tema
23 hours ago
I wonder who wrote this one
This is so bad I think he actually wrote it him self. And it’s so bad it is disrespecting MJ
Finally got a ghost rider huh
Cringe
Isn't Jake a tax evader.. Isn't the FBI investigating him for rioting.  Jordan won't approve this song anyways  Probably doesn't know who the fuck this guy is.
I Highly doubt his audience of 10 year olds know what he’s talking about
Does anyone realize that he still has a ghost writer??
This song is fire my 50th time listening to it 🔥🎂🎂
Jake Paul: I feel like Jordan I am back in my prime Michael Jordan: cap
I thought coronavirus was going to be the worst thing about 2020. Guess i was wrong
They're slowly merging with the new Justin Beiber
Who’s the ghost writer
Ugh, music nowadays is such trash.
ghost writer
"So me and ONE friend wrote the song"
Man atleast give credit to your ghost writer smh
No kapp this shii bops ahhh 🔥👌🏾

My ears are blinding you should pay for my hospital bill
I had a sharp pain in my head 20 seconds in..
Ayyy it sounds 🔥 at 2:06
His song is so great people saying jealous there’s a lot of rappers in the industry are wack but this song I love
Please watch the music video multiple times to inspire Jake to return to Vlog Life again

This banger is the new WAP! 💥
Wow this is terrible
Yo jake can u say hi to ur ghost writer for me. He must be working hard
Who came here just to dislike it?

Everyone: did you write this song  *Jake: yes but actually no*
He will Heart this comment if he loves his fans
Those beats were sick dud
To observe what is, meaning you have no opposite. The opposite exists because you know violence and the opposite has its root in what is. We think by having an opposite, we’ll get rid of the what is.
Why is this trending at #2 and Usher's new song trending at like #40?
he rapped a couple of good bars then said “yeah this shits fire”
at least he is attractive
R
E
G
G
The way he say no cap 🤦‍♂️

this would be good if anyone else but jake made it
N
Is this J-J-Joey the ghostwriter? 🔥
yo this go hard
I can’t believe I’m watching this...
This is tragic, if you look at his YouTube he gets views on music videos more than anything because people want to see if it's bad, which it is
remember when blink-182 said "nobody likes you when you're 23? yeah..."
Everyone: Did you write this song? Jake: Yes me and one friend
MJ finna cry in the car cuz of this
This song is better than KSI’s Loose
Man that Ikea advert was so good
*Do people still like him lol?*
Maybe it will make too 100 this time
Why is he pretending he smoke weed 🤦
TRASH
clown
This is the same flow as your last song and the beat is shite
Jakes new music is fire
It’s rubbish and probs got a gost  writer
Number of likes is the number of ghost writers Jake had
This is terrible no cap haha
ghost writer??? whatever! he writes his own songs I looked on the internet
🗑
Can we all make an agreement to never click on another jake Paul video because that just boosts his ego and no one wants that
Well JJ's video's gonna be so funny exposing Jake's ass

You can hear it bro kill jasper wrote this but either way the bars fire 🔥🔥🔥
1:49  “Haters are punching the air and accusing him of ghost writers”  Did you write your song?  Jake: yeah, me and one friend. We would go from bar to bar.
Me and 1 friend😂
This guy sitting on money thinking he’s the richest but he’s gotta remember KSI beats him in every aspect lol, YouTube, Boxing, Music, Fame, Money list goes on

Why does Jake Paul look like a 40 year old pretending to be 23.

As much is this good theres still me thinking if he wrote this
Only the song that he wrote "bar for bar" with his uncredited friend was bearable he's back to his annoying personality this guy is just fucked
No❤️
Is it just me or do they both look homeless
If they could edit it down to a 10 second clip it would be much appreciated, 10 seconds is the right amount of jake paul for 1 day.
He definitely uses the back door
Woah. A Paul brother that smokes. Just digging your career in the grave
I wonder who wrote this one
This if fire 🔥     On mute
Pin it you won't

Why do they always try to act black?! This song is bad.

Ghost writer 👻
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This is actually good if he wrote it
This is 🔥🙅‍♀️ cap
LSI fans really pressed. KSI doesn’t write his own songs, he gets help from his “friends”
I can barely make out what he sings but bro, this is lit !!!!
He look like ross creations
Fucking BOMB
repetitive and basic; i would expect nothing more from jake paul 👌
Who’s the ghost writer for this then
Everybody wanna rap these days
Damn jake really stepped up his game from the first songs he ever posted
When your black friend shakes up with you
This is actually good
Stop making music please for my ears
23  23 minutes to write his lyrics
Is it just me or is this the only song by him that gose hard
Song Name: 23 Plot Twist: he’s actually 8
Trash
1:20 Jake Paul hiding his ghostwriters in that money bag
WTF wannabe mathers?
this sounds exactly like the last one 😑
THIS IS THE BEAT OF THE YEAR
Try and write a song yourself for a change
Lol looks like his sitting on a massive hemorrhoid
Take notes ddg all youtubers get views on rap
Ridiculous
Jake likes his hairline on recline as well.
🔥🔥
Better than Trippie 😂
i have been lovin his songs keep it up jake love you no homo
Why does this have likes
Y’all jus hating cuz it’s a trend 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
Way to pin the only comment you liked cherrs
Ghost writer
This is literally like a remake of fresh outta london it’s almost the same
How much he pay his ghostwriter?
Oh so he’s still here great
This song is epic when it's muted
You didn't fucking write this
Miley Cyrus did it better... anyways chile
23 at 23k comments
We all know the only reason this vid has views is cause most people clicked on this to dislike it
just here to disslike
If you think this sounds good but is still trash for some reason. Click that like.
I saw this yesterday, the beat pops and the rap is clean, and as a result, it's number 1 trending
Jack Harlow in a nutshell
Jake Paul the type of person to grab the water instead of the curtain when he falls in the shower
but did you write the song tho
I’m sad I even gave this a click
corny af
This hard
Is this a joke?
Y’all remember when clowns were around?They never caught jake (his music as)
I feel sorry... for the human race
People scrolling down the comment, have a great day :)
I bet he went BAR FOR BAR IN THE STUDIO with this one too lmaooo
What is that jersey it looks like it’s from a Vietnam sweatshop
So we gone ignore the fact that this dude flexing bout his money but can’t afford an authentic Jordan jersey?
Finally real music
trash just like every new artist same same same damn shame.......
Producer: How many lines do you you wanna repeat? Jake: yes
This is so trash 😂
Ok his music is starting to get wayyy better from a year ago
What...Has My Childhood..Come too? Jake Caught the Miley Cyrus case.
If he's this good back to back... I cant see ghost writers...all I see is success and excellence👏👏👏
cringe
guys jake smoked a single blunt with a couple guys from a hood and he thinks he’s hard now
Make a Movie Jake Paul called Saving Private Paul
At least he didn't wake up like the man.
Jake music is fire, no doubt 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kill jasper did a good job writing this song
.
Ppl only here to dislike 😂
I wish you could hit the dislike more than once. If you could i would
Dis the one (:
We’re definitely in an Idiocracy.
huh
Congrats for #1 on trending
He doesn’t have anyone credited on Spotify as a writer lmfao Ksi really got to him 😂
Ghost writer part two
Who is the second vocals?
“another hit song” he hasn’t even made a hit song in his life and I doubt this one would be a hit
Gooooooood
No way he wrote this
Dang nice song jake
no♥️
this actually bangs harder then KSI's new song. Cannot deny it man.
why was this song lowkey kind of good 😭
This song has a vibeeeeeee 🔥
Tisè
Claim your jake pauler reputation 🤣
This is it. We have reached peak music, nothing can ever match this work of pure brilliance by the younger Paul.
You should make an album
I have to say he probably has a ghost writer but he still has a very generic flow and sounds like other people in almost every song
this new ghost writer be fire dude
The song is 🔥🔥🔥
Y he tryna be gangsta tho he’s from Ohio, he needs to stop w the ice, grills and the joints and get back to being who he actually is
I wonder who wrote this one
I thought you couldn’t get any lower but i thought wrong
worst song of 2020
this auto tune is making me feel sick   i think this song gave me corona
But nobody like you when you're 23
Hey jake just so you know you do have supporters
He Doesn't write his songs
“Me and a friend”
🙏
“It’s ok to get help”
I guess his ghost writer quit
Shouldn’t he be in jail now
the song hits better with no volume
What an absolute douche nugget this guy is.
Why is this really bad????
This guy really just pinned the only comment saying this song was good      Edit: my comments just a joke
FBI will like this video.
And of course, it’s on 9/11 you parasite
Change the flow
why this actually hit so little like the lack of talent in this song is probably more than his subscriber count-
Literally sounds like his other song
Bar for bar with another friend
Fresh Outta London was a one in 1 million this song is trash all songs are going to be trash he got lucky I mostly came here to dislike like if you agree
Bar for bar with another friend
Why he act like he in some type of gang now 😂😂😂😂
last song was good but this one trash
gon be funny when he loses the fight lol
On mute at 0:06 he just looks like a very angry gay man
Waiting for Jake to start deleting the negative comments
🤮
This is a big L
Now who wrote this ? Snoop Dogg?
Who else gave him views to dislike ?
How you going to have Jason derulo in the video but only a backup voice in the song????  Like it hits but Jason should of had a part.
this would be a good song if jake wasnt on the vocals
Its so trash
Fresh outa London was way better sry jp
The seats in regular Mercedes recline too
Stop haten on jake he's trying be a good guy
Dis coldddddd 🥶
Who's here before 1 million views??
He cant have people at his door if the place is gated

Do they ever get tired of being children?
People listen to this garbage?
Dude was at his local playground and thought it’d be cool to rap to his friends to a backyardigan beat
Ngl ksi fan here this song is good
Literally the exact same beat as Fresh Outta London ..... Copy and Paste???
Anybody else like the song but cringe at the video
Just go to jail. You're worthless.
Why isn't this guy dead yet
No, no and no
Producer carried this song
What happend to taking over pewdiepie jake?
He's transform himself to be journalist rapper ...;)
Nice ghost writer.
First 10 sec were good but the rest is embarrassing.
Duda Castro🥰
It’s good but a shame you didn’t write it
I think he wrote this because it’s ass
This is good but everything is ruined when you realize he had a ghost writer
Fire song Jake keep up the good work
Anyone else here because we heard rumors jake dissed ksi or is it just to dislake the vid, I'm here for both, his music is wank
Retarded version of 24 by money man
Can you be in my music video
Homeboy did PewDiePie's "can you do this?!!!" Meme in 2020
Jake paul is atrocious
Kinda fire
He didn’t write this 😂😂😂
Okay imma be honest when it said “Jake Paul woke up today, people are outraged” yeah that was kinda funny 😂
I see a man trying to stay relevant in a community that doesn't care
💪💪💪
You might be white, but you’ll never be *Jake Paul trying to copy Drake’s hand gestures* white
KSI fans punchin the air rn
pretty good ngl
Nobody: Kaje pole: I’m 23 so I’m a bommer
Here before KSI reacts to it
this is a major upgrade from his previous music
Ghost writer did you well on this song, and the last one👍
Damn this shits 🔥
People discredit Jake in every possible way nowadays
Chile anyways so I’m going to McDonald’s anyone want anything?
He rap better than most of the 2020 xxl freshman list 😂😂😂
I mean I’ve heard a lot worse honestly. This wasn’t terrible. Repetitive for sure but catchy.
He’s so white that he’s making that car look black  (The Second one you geniuses)
Bruh
2020 was bad enough.
Is PewDiePie still next?
DAM
Epic song broh
Ngl This is alright Even though its jake fucking paul
And this is why KSI makes better music
It might just be me but i think he likes seats that recline.
🤔 no
Yo the ghost writers are rich af cuz of Jake Paul
This is the garbage youtube is promoting???
i thought he got raided
Trash as always
what happens when FBI raids your house
Lol, thought this clown was finally going to get sent to prison.
Ksi his new yt vid: yo guys we are gonna find the ghostwriter boys 😂
I just think you're trash for looting that mall in Arizona. Wish the cops had thrown you in jail like the kids you encouraged to loot.
Out of jail i am guessing
Lit🖤🔥
Whos the tighter?
Who is The Ghost Writer This Time ? Designer or Tory Lanes
Jakey, you need to chill. This SH!T HAWD!!!

Why is jake paul trending#1 and 9/11 isn't
You've just been cursed by the 23 GOD
i love his like dislike ratio
He must’ve written this one without his ghost writer, trash
This song low key is a fucking vibe
Am sorry but it's a bit sketchy that he went from its everyday bro to this like come on he went from rapping like he on the playground at school to nearly being a rapper something ain't right chief

I mean even if he didn't write it, the guy definitely learned how to rap with the big boys. Well done.
The lyricism is so generic, if you actually wrote this song please write better lyrics for the next one
🔥
There’s never been a more obvious “I have ghost writer” song than this 😂😂😂

He gotta do something with 69
Your seats recline? What a flex

he should use some of that money to get lipo with his fat ass
This a vibe tho...🔥🔥
Awkward 😳
🔥🔥
Stop it get some help
Who ever writes his songs, plz rap it yourself, it hurts inside to hear a banger of a song and come to the realization that it’s Jake Paul singing
Nah cs gimme some of that money
Y’all mad cause this is actually a good song
You know this ain't Jakes writing this dude ain't ever think he Jordan he ain't worthy
Jake: Grows a beared      Jake: *OK NOW IM A DOOSH*
jake pauls music is on par with mosey and keeds freestyles.
Y’all need Jesus 👋🏼
Love it keep making new videos and songs
ok
Wow This ghost writer goes hard
The fact that he said he feeling like Jordan is like one of the most disrespectful things I’ve ever heard
Did disiner wrote this again
Jake paul back at it again with cringe
Jake shld film himself while making lyrics then we'll know if he actually wrote his songs until that people will keep accusing him. Song bangs tho.
Your beard looks like pubes 🤢
Fresh outta London is better
hot garbage
This IS HARDDDD
Op
Dislike squad wya
I wonder who wrote this one
Why is this actually pretty bad
This is fire, but i got one question. Who wrote this for you ?
I disliked without even watching lol
Jake Paul is little used old douch bag, goes to Arizona to loot and riot, he needs the same treatment.
Dammmmmmm this is 🔥
There's 22,000+ comments, if you find mine you're a legend.
This ghost rider best be getting paid a lot😂🤦🏻‍♂️

Jake Paul looks like the girls vs boys meme
🔥🔥
Am I the only one who does my duty and comes here to dislike the vids
the last part 🔥🔥🔥🔥
why is this good
If only u wrote this Jake
No❤️
imagine if he made this song when he was still relevant, like the everyday bro era
Waiting for KSI to react and call it trash or that someone wrote it for him😂. Jealous that someone is better than him, especially Jake Paul.
Okay who wrote this
Just when I thought he fell off the face of the earth
How dare he compare himself to jordan.
Honestly thought he got locked up
trash.
This man is the 6ix9ine of YouTube
Well I got cancer listening to this so yeah team YouTube
Immature.
he thinks that he is a rapper
They say having negative IQ is scientific is impossible, however those very same people also say the human race is constantly developing to be “better”.
Fresh out of London is way better
BOORRRIIIIINNGGGGGGG
He didn't write this lmao
this song is kinda gay
Literally stole jaycee’s hole song🤦
"Jake nice job, you made this by yourself?"  *" Y-Yeah, me and o-one friend that's it."*  Is anyone gonna believe he did this by himself since he exposed himself from the last song?
The beats r better than lil mosey freestyle
Bro your songs are actually fire now!!!!$$$$
now how wrote this song for you🎶😭😂
Everyone wanna be a rapper and flex like a black person nowadays huh
Really good voice
Can’t complain
Insane bro
he really thought he did something
This fire asf

Lets get the dislikes over the likes.

No 🧢
FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO CAPPPPP
I came just to dislike
Who else  just turned 23
Culture vulture at its finest. 🤢🤮

vril hosts where ya at?
If HE wrote it the song would be decent.
Jake in a gang now?
Ah it all makes sense now,  Your frontal lobes aren't fully developed yet only 23, silly me.   Also serious question, can you actually satisfy 2 women ? I have big doubts 2 pump
Trash music
Homie is heavily influenced by the culture smh
This isn't Everyday Bro 2  Freaking Liar you promised >:(

Alright alright this kinda slaps
I see that your ghostwriters is working hard
Garbage
“smokes once”   jake: “i’m hard now”
Ghostwriter
I want Jake Paul and drake to collide
Looks like the moneybag is stuck up his ass.
Stop. I mean come on. Stop man. Talkin about Jordan’s. Bro MJ would’ve hit you with a “stop it. Get some help”
Ohhh no

I know nobody will see this,      But you did
BIG shoutout to whoever ghostwrote this song, youre awesome.

At the end of the day your still Jake Paul and you’ll never catch real music fans listening to Jake Paul
He went from team 10 to this song!!Dang
I loathe anything Jake Paul but damn this rap is fire!
Ksi got some competition
Lol this is whack. Sounds just like Fresh outta London same flow. 0 versatility.
This song slaps🤑🥳🎧
I hope you get sued by MJ for comparing trash (yourself) to him
Has anyone noticed that jake likes Italian sounds
Gay
This is very monotone, please consider rapping better.
J-J—Joey!
I’ve always liked your music but now your on another level and you inspired me to do boxing please read this Jake it would make my day so much 🥊🙏
I wish he was stop wearing those f’ing grills he’s got gorgeous teeth
this song didnt hit it the same as fresh outta London
I like the song FIGHT ME
Why does ksi and jake paul always drop tunes on the same day?
2 min song and 1:30 seconds is just him repeating the same hook 5 times... pathetic
Ugh, I think jake Paul sees the same person that does Donald trumps face, he’s starting to look a little Oompa Loompa
LP: Lizard People.  Look up the vid “coconut milk: the reptilia n beverage” and thank me later
Like just gonna say this I preferred his last two songs over jj's, didn't think I'd ever say this but fuck it🤷‍♂️
I have been in a wheel chair my whole life, but today I got up to turn this sh*t off

Looks like somebody finally grew up😂🤦🏾. Took almost his whole YouTube career.😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️
if this was age restricted this video would have 7 views
I would liked the song ....        If he wrote it
ok who wrote this then
This would be fire if jake Paul dident have his past and was just a rapper!
This song is better than i expected better verse and hook
How’s here before jj
#1 trending. Congrats Jake
satans puppets he does 666 in profile and one eye.. 23  is 2/3=66.6% jordan was also a demon
Finally Jake Paul remembered his YouTube password.....
who else automatically disliked the video as soon as they clicked on it? hahaha
ghostwriter??
This is low-key 🔥
Search 23 genius lyrics, and look up the writers, this was primarily written by Kill Jasper
FIRE
Lit af 🔥
2 minutes? 🤦🏾‍♂️
I left a dislike cause no way he wrote this
funny how he doesn't mention who wrote it in the credits.  Altough Kill Jasper is one of the writers
Douchest YouTuber ever   clicked because it was trending
This is straight 🔥🔥
The video was liked until I saw on the news that “Jake Paul is still getting accused of having ghost writers” just admit that you are this talented 😐
🔥🔥🔥🚫🧢
Bullshit
im maxy yt
No way he wrote this lol
Better pay your taxes simp
Why this is so trash?
who else misses the old Jake Paul
2M views in 1 day dang
Should be locked up
Well if you acted like a decent human being and believed that there is a pandamic, the feds wouldn't have showed up. Stop being a Karen who expects unrealistic things to happen.
*GAYVAMMMM?ZBGGSHHYY_
mate u got a ghost writer again nice mate go make you own lyrics
Nice one
Did you go "back and forth" with ur guy again for this one? yep
You made it again brother ♥️🔥
This isn’t for jake personally, in fact the song is good, I just find it interesting that y’all came at adel and attacked her for her Bantu knots in support of Jamaican culture but when it comes to the plethora of white artists that come into the hip hop scene using hip hop culture, beats, and flows y’all are silent.
Which one of your ghost writers write this one for you.
Waiting for jj to react 😂
This beat slaps so hard
comment section, how y’all be gettin subs with no videos?!!! pmo frrr lol. i have videos and still can’t even get to 100 help me outtt‼️
So u and how many friends wrote this?
I hope jake paul get corona🤬
nle choppa clone

Fun fact: jake didnt write this
Bell 🔔 End 🔚

Well if you shown who actually writes the songs then we "haters" may actually believe you.
literally 99% wont see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day read my name❤️
Everyone: Did you write this ? Jake Paul: Yeah me and a few friends.
O man u got r/ksi another meme
if this was by any other artist i would've enjoyed this.
Jake Paul is human diarrhea
He glich qt 0:53
Aight who ghostwrote this song this time?
Crap
This song hits different on mute
Bruhhhh 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🙂
Alr He got a ghost writer but he flows so good on the song
Number 1 yessir
This his best song because it was the shortest feeling one. He is the most autotuned boy ever. He isn't a rapper he is a clown who is popular even tho he has no talent
Come on I thought you went to jail that was supposed to good
Here before KSI fans spam the dislike button 😂
People who thought this is real🤡
This randomly came on my recommended(19 hours ago)

Who else here when this is #1 on trending?
Who wrote that one this time
Anyone want to see a remix with Jack Harlow?                  .   👍 = Definitely
Bruh why does this kind of sound like his other song fresh out llondon🤔
I’m a fan of ksi but jake Paul’s last 2 songs have been better than ksi’s
Funny how Ksi doesnt have a song that is trending when he doesnt have  a feature.
So perfect that login is in it
Some one get the bleach,I need to clean my eyes
ksi watching this : there is no way you wrote this who wrote this for you .
Fireee
Oh yeah this 🔥
Imagine hating Jake Paul!
Amazing bruvvvvvvvvvv !!!!!!! <33333333333333333333333333
Everyone is a hip hop artist. This was horrible.
Why is this recommended
stfu
Ok where is desiigner ?
Jake Paul just keepst getting better ! <3
Rumour has it he stole Cardi B's rhythm on the verse.
Bruh i forgot this dude was even alive
Awesome song !
This is literally the same music as straight outta London with different lyrics the guy needs to do summat himself that's good for once
This song is a face palm In a nutshell 🤦🏼‍♀️
No. Just please  No.
why brought 2017 here
this one should get more views than its everyday bro.
Y'all niggas can get stuck on the lyrics if u want, but this niggas cadence, flow, and delivery is already league's above ksi. The only thing jj has on this kid, music wise, is that he is proven to be the writer of his own songs.
Yo someone get gawne in here so he can show Jake a good rap ab Michal Jordan
I never liked this man but this was fire what
Jake be like : this time let's actually remove the credits totally from Spotify. Just performed by Jake Paul
Stop

Definitely listen to it on mute it sounds 100% better
Fun fact : u came here just to dislike
How is this so good
Jake you killed this time..London was good but this  one killed.....
He’s the type of person that wear a mask at home
The scene with the news headline you know he got defensive so had to put it in LOOL
Winder who wrote this one too
Can someone else rap the song so that I can listen to it because it’s Jake Paul’s voice rn :(
My teacher said I couldn't get any dumber. I'm here to prove him wrong.
Trash
He is my favorite artist now no🧢
I love the way everyone’s hating even when they know this was probably the best song Jake Paul has ever made in his life
Is it just me or does this sound similar to the previous... he needs to be able to change it up
Ksi is better
this is gold
This sounds amazing on MUTE👏👏
Sick track, good lyrics, Mediocre vocals
State of this
Lol
Hi Jake Paul I'm Mr wolf from among us
Crap!
So bad omg hahahahq
Why the bigass vevo watermark?
This song just ain’t it, period
He sounds like he sang the whole song with those grills in his mouth
Jake just loves playing the victim card lmao  "Jake Paul woke up today, people are outraged"  wow
Stop making good music this instant
Waiting for the new vlogs
No cap this slaps.
Jake new songs are fkn awesome
Why jake
So Littttt 🔥💣🇽🇰⚡
Didn't know I could find a song worse than Straight outta London but guess I was wrong. This song is 🤢
Breaking news: Jake paul yet again didn't write one of his new songs WHAT A SURPRISE
Jake paul KSI is gonna whop your ass
He didn't write it
wow i'm shocked
This song sounds the same as the last one 😂
Another dead song flexing money and women

Nah this def hits different on mutee!!
Name of the girls in the car ?
This is very trash
he is adleast trying
this go crazy jake good work!!!!
Bruh this sounds like he shot Lil Tecca and stole this song.
Erika is with 69
Incoming KSI bumbois
He doesn't write his own  music
way to make 9/11 even more depressing...
I'd rather listen to Cardi B
He say's he's Jordan (23), but if anything he's more like the Bulls's waterboy  In my opinion KSI is way better
Damn Jake has improved so damn much
Relatable
I owe anyone that likes this $100 if Jake wrote this
It ain't it
who else thinks it’s weird asf that he smokin?
At this point ksi’s fans are mad that jake is succeding that’s why they disliked the video there jealous
Jake Paul: Smokes a Blunt                 Fans: 911 what u smoking
jake paul is turning into a rapper like cigars and stuff
Bruh there's so many haters in the comments lmao, just admit he can rap
Ngl jake I’m starting to like ur  music no cap
He still be posting on yt
So did you go bar for bar with one of your guys on this one too
Bad
lol the first few secs already know this is trash
Is this guy forgetting his audience  his like 3 to 5 year olds
Isn’t he in jail?
Times like this I’m glad I’m deaf
The best 20 seconds of FREEDDAWG are better than this song.
Why do i see 23 everywhere
Bruh this song kinda a banger
Greatest song ever
Fresh outta London is better
Stick to youtube bruh
If you look closely you can see a ghost in the background telling him what to say
I think i can hear ksi laughing eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee man
. LP: Lizard People.  Look up the vid “coconut milk: the reptilia n beverage” and thank me later
How can you like this?
Guys he doesn't have a ghost writer remember. He just has a guy that helps him with certain parts of the song and how it sounds.   😂
Nise song bro
Jake is at another level 🙏🏻 🔥
Jake paul swatted himself all so he can have a bar saying about police watching ..
decent song but i wouldn't willingly listen to it...
It is the same
"Jake Paul wakes up today, people online angry"   This is very true.
I am 10
Niceeee😁😁
ngl this is just getting sad
Omg best song ever
This 23 is BETTER than Loose KSI.
bro his new music is uhhhh Alot better
To the 1% reading this:   I hope your parents live long to see you succeed, hoping to get 1 sub from you guys😘
Whose waiting for KSI to react ?👀
My birthday month is January in a day is 26
Flopper!!
Imagine being worse than a asian guy who created the word irrelevant
Why it this trending?
Who Is The Girl On The Left In The Car? 😂 Anyone Know?
I thought he went to jail for looting
This kid thinks he is dababy
I am deaf, this is amazing 👏
Well to be perfectly honest ,in my humble opinion without being sentimental of course , without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view,but also by looking into this matter in distinctive perspective ,i would like to say i have nothing to say...thank you
His mum is writing his music
This or Down like that?
Can we get this to hit 1 MILLION dislikes?!
Welcome to my channel for cute pandas !🥰🥰🥰
He looks like a leprechaun
Lmao he’s using the exact flow that his ghost writer uses cmon at least try to be original
All the haters are KSI in disguise?
Jake Paul says “NO CAP” with suck force it’s so funny. Well done Jake song number two is a hit.
Gayyyyyyyyyyyy
So who wrote this one?
Ksi when he reacts to this: Ight, let's check his monthly listeners. Jake: let's check ur abortion record.😂
💩
Is It Just Me Or Does The Rhythm Almost Sounds Like His Fresh Outta London Song????
*Buys “came before KSI” ticket*
Another song that is made by him
So fucking good 😝
Damn even lil mosey xxl freestyle better then this and that scares me
Obviously someone ghostwrote this song there are so many proofs like cmon
What are they actually doing at the end? Are they trying to take off like birds? 😐
Me: Mom I want NBA youngboy  Mom: We have NBA youngboy at home  NBA youngboy at home:
Hot
littness
Tbh the hook dope
Damn he want to everyday bro to this fire 🔥
So many yesmen in the comment sections lol
That's fire🔥

He’s literally sang the same words over and over again for 2 minutes....
Gay
Now this is actually good music
Why his hair look like a pack of 2 minute noodles doe?
One problem with this song... It's short
So who wrote this one?

Jake is killing It 💪💪💪
Love the fact you showing smoking is cool to young kids
Absolutely garbage 😂😂😂
How is this bum 2 on trending
Simba number ooone already... 🥱 🤫
You know Jake you really should put your girlfriend and her strapon collection in your videos. 😉
Just stop bro (Replie good advice)
This song bangs so I would listen to it, however, the only downfall is that it’s made by Jake Pau- sorry.. Jake Pau- .. *sighs* The one tryna beef KSI
I started listening to this song and my phone started lagging
His flow has increased 100% since *it's everyday bro*
Just showed this to my therapist and she's finally letting me kill my self.
No wonder suicide is rampant in society, we reward bad behavior.
here before KSI
Just disliking and leaving same as you keep scrolling.
Do you think his next song from jail will also be "fire"
Oh your still making videos ?
Why he acting like he can ball
He is so obsessed with ksi it’s crazy
1:36 whos she
Aight let's check his monthly listeners
Trash
i will never add a jake paul song to my playlist.
jake is a little difrent its like he is on drugs
I’m pretty shure Michael Jordan didn’t set his pool on fire
Go look on spotify for this song and check the "credits" tab.
No I like them to
why is it always about money, girls and drug?
His ghost writer did good on this one.
When’s the next hit?
Guy doesn't even care bout likes and dislikes he's already got more money than every one of us!
Let me guess he “wrote this himself” 😂
U defo didn’t write this
This man is so cringe it hurts
I love it
The sad thing is is that this guy will probably be richer than most of us will ever be
The dislikes are from the ksi fans
Can u plz just write your own music
why does the thumbnail say vevo
Jordan is disgraced...
Another great ghost written track
The first one was better ngl but i see improvement, well played jakie..
🔥🔥
And then jj will laugh at it
Jakes so amazing going from 0-100 real quick with them sick ass beats, get it Jake it’s fire im excited to hear more songs🔥🔥

"I have money" - Jake Paul  Saved you 2 minutes of your life.
Naw I like the other one. This one doesn't hit the same
If I had a penny for every rap song that had boys dancing on top of a building with champagne and doing that aeroplane arm thing I'd have a lot of pennies
I like how people are pissed off 😂😂
Everyone screen shot the credit on lyrics before it’s gone again 😂😂
Hopefully this fella will is soon

i am "so impressed" that the USA  and YT is commemorating 9.11 with this "beautiful" song ...
I thought sixnine was a mumble rapper but damn jake Paul smashed sixnine in being a mumble rapper
This is the first song/rap i like
RIP to the 3000 people that died 20 years ago

It’s good u can’t cap but he ain’t write it
Oooook!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Plus you got gassed over your song being on the radio, KSI had bare songs on the radio, he charted top 5 in the uk, and charted somewhere in the US, you were nowhere to be seen in either😂
I came to see the dislikes
Jake i think u should move on from ksi nd every past beef nd focus on urself cuz got some serious talent. Same as ksi did , he moved on nd now is actually improving himself in music . U should do the same u got talent same way as ksi nd his bro nd ur bro does
What a set of bell ends

Can believe people tried cancel Adel because of a hair style yet this idiot continues to have an audience. You should all be ashamed to watch him and his brother.
He’s gotta be worse than morgz

For as rich as this bum is, you think he'd be able to afford a decent producer and ghostwriter.

Jake is just that good period.
The song is good but the fact that it is Jake Paul that performance it makes it horrible.
He may be rich at 23, but I bet he'll be bald by the age of 30.
Definitely a ghost writer
I'm I the only one who doesnt like his songs? LOL
He's trying to gain the same response 6ix9ine got for coming back by shouting out his haters. We all know he's no where close.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.

Someone own up who wrote his song
Dude sounds like a cheap imitation Caskey. Tried copying his pronunciation style delivery, but none of his skill. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Worst song of the year

Ksi 2nd channel vid has more views and it was dropped at the same time lol
“Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire” “good luck” 💸
Why is he making out with girls and smoking stuff when his audience is so young 🙄
Did you and your friend go bar for bar on this one?

But like who’s gonna open Spotify or Apple Music and choose to stream this? I’ll listen to kids bop 37 before I submit myself to this.
Saying KSI's songs keep getting worse when Jake got 7million streams on his last song while KSI up at 25 million and they were released on the same day. Smh this guy delusional
Ok who’s the ghost writer?
All I gotta say is,  Y’all can’t cap iykyk
this is a ss
Um... Who asked for this?
KSI is better
21 polo g Fortnite version
JAKE PAUL SMOKES NOW?!?!?! LMAOOOO
2 minute song? Even shorter without the intro 😂 only thing I heard was the chorus on repeat 😂😂😂
Ghostwriters? I think yes
I’ve Never Disliked A Video Before
Obviously you has a ghost writer 😂😂😂 no one is accusing you. You have one.  That what they are saying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Funny how KSI song dropped today aswell lmao
Welp there goes 2:06 of my life ill never get back why do I do this to myself....
​
His ghostwriter has bars
All the haters secretly dancing making sure no one sees them , because they know this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jake please give me one of your girlfriends
Instant dislike
Can we just listen to the fukin song instead of over arguing who wrote it lolll
Is jake signed to Atlanta records? Aren’t they known to have ghostwriters write for certain youtubers? Lol
Kill ittt brooooo❤️❤️❤️❤️
better than its everyday bro
Another dumbass track! Fumny thing is if you look at him he wants to be like KSI sooo bad haha! Still a waste of life!
Damnn..... ure good at music ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Daddy really did that
This is actually 🔥 same with Fresh Outta London
This is too good to be Jake Paul, but I can’t deny this is kinda 🔥, I wonder what it would sound like if the person who actually wrote this is doing rn
I can’t even lie this was a little bit fire
Why TF does YT loves the Paul Bros so much??
K
Why do KSI and Jake always post their music at the same time?
I ain’t gonna lie Jake Paul music starting to go hard
Did 2 times the same Song. Creativ.
Ppl who never hated jake  👇
Best scene of the video👇😴  2:06

Are you here for this?? 👉 2:06
Best part of the video 2:06

Nice song but cmon straight outta London had a ghost writer u admitted it on Logan’s podcast
Hi
Who wrote this one?
Is it weird that I watched this dude when I was 8?
He ain’t writing his own songs
Hella repetitive apart from that it was ok
When you order da babys flow on eBay 😂
my favourite part is when it ends at 2:07
Jake doing the most
Let ksi do a reaction on this too😂😂😂😂
Definitely a ghost writer involved
Ok 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I won’t lie this is fire but if you can write your own music would be better
How do you go from Disney channel to stealing. Jake Paul is a slow downwards spiral harder then his story time ex
Im i the only thinks if polo g rap this it will be 10x better
JJ Olatunji FANS 💯
lil short, lotta repetition, but sounds good
2 verses being repeated for 2 straight minutes. That's what I call music
He must be broke to put out more garbage like his "career"... Sounds like another person rapping.
You come up with 6 lines and call it a song? A hit song?
Do y’all actually like this like I’m genuinely Curious?
am i the only one who’s confused why jake making 🔥 songs out of nowhere?
The start of jake paul being a rapper
Its true I was the drone 😔

It’s alright but I wouldn’t listen cuz I’m a hater
Ksi when we need you the most🤣
Is every Jake Paul song trending now? And this song is honestly really god

He has a ghost writer ffs! WHAT IS WRONG WITH U LOT
How do I block the Paul Brother on YouTube???
Another song he didn’t write
When you order Justin Bieber off Wish.
The songs 🔥🔥
It’s the exact same flow as the last one 😭 needs to get a diffrent ghost writer for each song
The best part is logans part haha...love the flow though
meh
You can’t lie he changed for the good
So, he went from making kid friendly and fun videos for children. And now he’s cursing, trying to be a rapper, and smoking marijuana    Pathetic....
GREEN  SCREEN !!!!!!!!!!!!  ???????
Why are people hating on this song?its very decent
And your cell mate like it when he was inside
that’s fuckin fireeeeee🔥

This is just the same thing over and over why are people saying its good So generic it hurts
Least he’s better then mgk he gives me a better version of him lol
Yo
Who else clicked and paused the video just to dislike the video and read the comments?
the fact that jake's face is so punchable, makes me cringe while watching/listening to this.

*Finally, a song that i can sing for the school talent show*
At this point y’all just hating this is hard
Jake trying to act hard when he's some kid from Ohio. LOL Hasn't he realized he's been cancelled yet?
You know that the dislikes are coming from people who haven't even heard the track!!
Lowkey hit💥💥
This song is gonna have alot of dislikes like the rest of his songs
Only if this song lasted for 3 fkn whole minutes :(!!!
Jake is killing it in music in 2020
He really ruined the way those jordans look
Still better than KSI music
I think this song is my favourite song of the year.
*The people who liked this comment is officially before 10 Million views.*
Jake paul on Fire!!! No cap🔥🔥
Reeeeeeeeeeeee
Why does jake Paul always realise his music on the same day as ksi
“Sighs”starts bumping dis heat
Is it me or does the bag of money he sits on looks like an overgrown private part?
So on his first song he released this year y’all complain about him having too much people while filming now that he filmed semi anti corona y’all saying his production is bad? At this point I’m convinced y’all just hating on him cause the media wants you to
HARD.... GO CRAZY
Better than 6ix 9ine
Complete trash lol
Criminal music
Damn Miley Cyrus looks different
When u think he might actually quit drugs

Omg...what even is the live chat😐 why they lying to him
Jake Paul is the type of guy who would throw a rock at the ground and miss
im just wondering how many of these views hes botted haha
social distancing???
This song makes lil moseys freestyle sound fire
Jake Paul tryna be like ksi
Sounds like the other song
makes fun of ksi yet copies everything he does
The thing is people wouldn’t be so pissed that he has a ghost rider if he isn’t going around like a 3 year old saying that ksi and other people have ghost riders too
Wow
Trasshhhhhhhhhhhh. What's the feds watching him for??
so whose the ghostwriter for this song?
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP MAKING MUSIC

This song is bad, but the predictable ass comment section makes it look like a drake single

At this moment this is above an interview with 6ix9ine on the trending page. What even are we as a species anymore
I’ve never seen a white boy try so hard in his life to act like a Black Man. Song is also completely disrespectful to my ears and the concept of music as a whole
Inlove with this song😋😭😭💖💖💗💛💗💖
Imagine him being as cool as j-hope I’m UGH! Just imagine
I’m wondering how that accent is gonna come off as, especially considering current events
TGEEZY #1 FULLSUPPORT

THIS GUY IS THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO GOT TO HIS DREAMES BUT SKIPPED THE JOURNEY...
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!!!
JP is trash asf
Dude actually made a decently good song
KSI can’t compete
This guy is so cool using recycled lyrics and beats with an touch of autotune, just cant beat the originality of this song lmao wow just like I've been saying anyone can be a rapper these days.
ITS EVERY DAY BRO
Ok the only thing good about this song is the beat jake paul ruins it stop singing and just give us the beat
Wheb jake paul has a ghost writer
Who misses bisarbarc

KSI vs Jake Paul  Rap battle  Or  Boxing
Why is this fire?🔥
if your eardrums also bleed from this song i suggest pressing M on your keyboard it helps a ton
I'm mad that this fire
first couple sec of video.......boom big shot of money. come on man can no one be original at all anymore.
Ghost writers hard at work lmao
Was the stolen PF Chang’s vodka tasty?

NOW THATS HOW YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO YOUR MUSIC!!
This aint better than fresh outta London tho
Ngl its my own opinion but fresh outta London is way better than this song, like i would listen that song

Everyone's saying this song is trash but it's #1 on trending 👀
Why is this trending?
🗑
dislike the video didn't watch it yet
Goo Jakeeeeeeeey
All y'all in the comments complaining but he over here getting 1.7 mil in 12 hours... Can't no one give anyone credit nowadays, someone always gonna have a problem😂
So who wrote this one Jake
I thought you were in jail
i listened to this song over 30 times n im addicted to it
I can see KSI and Jake Paul making diss track’s on each other soon. They’re both dropping disses (granted KSI’s are more subtle and smart), but it’s all gonna come to ahead soon.
Im EMBARRASSED to say this song is a bop.
Boooooooo
Love you bro
Damn Jp is killing it with his music
Your music is fire
Guys he's on #1 on trending keep him there
Ksi got a competition
Disney to FBI in 3 years
Ew I’m off
I like him he is amazing
Littttt
This guy could make the best song in the world and most of you would still have something negative to say about it😂  hop off and let him do his thing!  Btw YES “Jake Paul drops ANOTHER fire song”
An empty song with no soul and no story. Both of the Paul brothers seem like the type of people who flex to hide how insecure they are on the inside. So far, both of the brothers have contributed nothing to the world of value. They are better at being fools than anything else, but maybe one day they will change. One can hope.
Isnt it CRAZY that by todays music standards this is actually good? 🤣🤣
Finally we get the mature Jake Paul
Why the fuck does it looks like he did gangs signs👁️👄👁️
Ghost written
I'm confused bc he gives me 2017-2018 vibes  when he said flipping instead if the f - word and now this
Neh
cringe
*Let's pray TikTok doesn't find a way to ruin this song*

Fun Fact tor the day! (also read my channel name) The apocryphal tale that you can't grow new brain cells just isn't true. Neurons continue to grow and change beyond the first years of development and well into adulthood, according to a new study.

I guess dude..? 😕
Its low key fire though. Idk why yall hating

You can make a vlog again but a music video
Lessss goooo 🤙🔥
By far Jake’s best song! Like if you agree so that Jake can see how much we, the Jake Paulers, support him!
Ghost writer got worst
✨✨✨
Cant believe you are making such sick rap songs im impressed jake
I liked the London song more than this one. But you are getting better good job
didnt even listen to a second of it and i automatically disliked it
Why is he wearing a bulls shirt when he’s in LA and isn’t from Chicago?
ok but like, it ain't terrible
Lmao this is lit asf keep bein mad
Why is this #1 on trending?????
his best song ever
This song is sadly 🔥
1:36 woah
This is the biggest diss against Jordan ever
How much auto tune do you want? Jake: yes.
I like em two at a time
jake got raid cuz of hes guns
i though he couldnt get any worse
Why is this so nice ?  Made me wonder
Jake Paul make new videos
Another banger eh?
Take your free ticket before it probably hits more dislikes than likes
If you want actually good music and music videos: Björk FKA Twigs Melanie Martinez  Sia Billie Eilish
2:01
Trash. All these views are from 10 year olds
jake why was you hiding this from me
Who’s the gosht writer 😂😂
Nah im a ksi fan just came to dislike
1# on trending YouTube is really kissing his @ss
This man looks like hes 400 pounds when he wears that jersey
The feds raided his house during the making of this song, but they couldn’t find them. The investigation is still going on tho.😂
Trashhhh. Prefer ksi’s
1 like = 1 ghost writer he used
“That’s a whole lot of eyes”
Hold on, I'll be right back, gotta throw up. Can't believe there are KIDS watching him constantly and he doesn't have enough brain cells to grow up and get a sense of RESPONSIBILITY to go along with his influence on them. I swear this guy and his brother are going to single handedly cause all the problems in Gen Z that we tease them about later in life: Vulgarity, materialism, disrespect, carelessness, pride, and obsession with approval/praise.
Damn that ghost writer was spitting
Im sorry did jake paul commit the jummy
Guess how many ghost writers he got on this? 🧐🤔
Wtf
23... is that the number of underage girls drugged at one of Jake’s house parties?
I thought fresh outta London was a fluke but I’m seeing consistency
Trash
Jake Paul somehow managed to make Michael Jordan look bad , congrats Jake you suck !
Kinda good
Ksi trash and he is a lair to
Ay yo so jakes from Westlake,ohio near cleveland and he saying 23 and referencing jordan??? What about the GOAT LeBron. Well I guess I wouldn't want LeBron to be mentioned in this absolute 🗑️ of a song. 😂
love it!
dis hard 🔥
Dang this song is fire!!!!!!!
If your over the age of 12 & your a Jake pauler smack yourself.
Jake  better than ksi   jake > ksi
Lmao wtf likes to listen to his song he stuck in 2016
It's so obvious desiigner wrote this
Sounds like Did It again by Lil Tecca
Another bang🔥🔥🔥💯
Lil moseys xxl freestyle was better than this
23 ghost writers ???
..........
Fuck.. I actually like this .. WHY GOD
I’m I the only one that thinks this song isn’t actually horrible? Like I kind of fuck with it😳
I like the ghost writer
Jake Paul the person to refill a pool with a cup of water.
Another friend?

No cap 🔥🔥
“Certified banger classics”
Me: No way 2020 can get even worse         2020- say less
I wanna see what Ksi is gonna say  Like: if ksi is gonna check his monthly listeners
This song is so good but money changed him alot!
Bruh watching jake Paul smoke a joint is honestly one of the weirdest things ever.
Number 1 on trending yet still below 2 million 🤨
if y’all say this ass y’all some HATERS💯

Jake Paul is the guy who calls people who criticize him “Haters”
HOLD UP, this is actually good
Wow number one on trending and this song slaps! Keep it up bro
The message behind this song and video couldn’t be more real... great work, Jake!!!
jakes song upgrades

Why do i get roddy rich vibes from his new songs
Best song yet big fan
His beard is weird
Now jake Paul has no idea how to make a bad song
*ok lets make this the 2nd most disliked video we gotta save YT Rewind 2020 1st*
I never thought I would say this, but I would rather listen to 23 by Miley Cyrus.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕
Jack bout to blow up if he makes music like this
Horrible
jake paul looks fatter
The beginning tho 🤣🤣
"Jake Paul woke up Today" "People Outraged"  This is kinda messed up, I mean I would be pissed if Jake Paul decided to Breathe Smh
i like em 2 at a time 🔥
KSI is better
Songs decent
Y can’t this guy just fall off
Like if "23" is by Mike WiLL Made It ft. Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa, & Juicy J
Krispy Kreme wore it better

Jake setting that thing on fire at the end is the equivalent of that gender reveal party that caused a huge fire.

Im just hear for when the pyro video comes out
Jeez, how many people did he pay in the comments to say “this song actually slaps,” “looking for the ghostwriter because this is good,” or “this is a banger”
this would be 1000000000 times if jp was replaced with jack harlow
Imagen making such a bad song a fortnite kid doesn't like it
“Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire” “good luck” 💸
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m a cancer patient that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer a few months ago. My doctor told be I have 3 weeks left, and I wanted to spend it watching the things that I enjoyed most. I have done that, and I am now officially ready to end my battle with cancer knowing I have seen something more cancer riddled than me.

Jake Paul is an idiot. I will admit. THIS SONG IS 🔥
This is making me question humanity. If the world creates people like him, I wouldn't mind the world ending.
I had no clue he was 23 I thought he's was l like 26 or 27  Anyways sat this on trending pretty good bro
Just when I thought 2020 couldn’t get worse
Look at Houdini that got the most streams of KSI’s new album and look in the writer section on Spotify... They wrote it for him
This music is trash still
What happen to it’s everyday bro and all the kid friendly stuff? :(
This is a downgraded Fresh Outta London ur ghostwriter needs to be more creative
Why is others people calling others people hater because they saying jake paul had a ghost writer when it's the truth 🤦‍♂️😂🤣
It’s just that for the last 2 he got a ghost writer or a better one and a god like prod
Is that it ?
Didn’t he have little girls at his mansion??
Omg y’all are awesome I think I died from laughter
OMG jake what.

Jesus said "So it will be at the end of the age, the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 13:49-50. Jesus also said "You are my friends if you do what I command you." John 15:14. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6.

This song should be played through every level of Hell in Dante's Inferno.
Honestly he’s just flexing on his money
I woke up this morning pretty refreshed, it seemed the negative thoughts and harmful views on myself had started to fade. It’s been a while since I had my last drink, or done some Carrie, I even called my parents to check up on them. It looked like things where looking up, my life was going to change for the better. Then I watched this video
i feel like he doesn’t write his own music
LP: Lizard People.  Look up the vid “coconut milk: the reptilia n beverage” and thank me later
I finally hit 26 subs!!!
Shame on all the Tik Tok/Viners that made these clowns famous
When is this guy gonna learn that YouTubers songs are trash(10% of the time)
Remember this is the guy that doesn’t care that we are in a pandemic  The guy that went from everyday bro to these type of songs  And the guy that won’t admit that he has a ghost writer
This dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ksi>Jake Paul

You guys are saying he didn't write it but how would anyone else know all the stuff he said about him personally like i know y'all have nothing to back it up you are going to write 10 years old or Ghost writer  BTW give a reasonable explanation why can't he improve and get better in 3 year from its everyday bro to " I'm single " to " these day " to " fresh out of London " to " 23 " ...
His music goes hard now
this sounds like such a generic rap song
*_Damm the ghost rider go hard!_*
Fresh outa London is better
People back then: jake be trashhhhh, his music in the garbageeeeeeee  People now: YOOOO JAKEE FIREEEEEEEEEEEEE

Doesnt this sound the same as the last one ?
why is this good-
The amount of cringe Jake Paul can generate from saying “no cap” is crazy
Waiting for ksi reaction
“Hey Patrick, wanna know what’s funnier than 23?” “Yeah”     “24”
There is around 1 minute and 26 seconds of pure chorus/no music at all in this video. wtf
Good flow
Imagine getting a ghostwriter

Pretty lazy. 2 minutes of the same chorus being repeated. 4 different scenes? Even the chyron only had like 4 things in repeat. I mean...what a waste cause it did have potential.

Bro I can promise no one cares what you do, I think you’ve ruined your image enough that people aren’t even surprised anymore, and give the ghostwriter credit we all know you wouldn’t be able to pump anything out greater than the atrocity that “it’s every day bro” is.

No matter what your point of view is on Jake Paul, but this is fire.
Wow, unfortunately this one was an L for me... maybe if I hadnt heard the London track?... Point being, this song is very similar to his last track. Dude lacks flow and style. Take it from me (check the channel name bruh) 😎

Shits way too short

YOU SOUND LIKE EVERY OTHER "RAPPER" OUT THERE. Talking about absolutely nothing relevant!
i have second- hand embarrassment right now. This is so cringe.
Yoooo.......
When he start smoking
Ok but why do I kinda like this 🤨😭 I think the lyrics are catchy somehow
Blond beards are weird.
Anybody else watch this without a reaction sounded exactly like the other one just repeating the same course over and over hella
I love the new music keep up the hard work also sub to my YouTube channel ChillWithReflx
The fact that this garbage is trending is why we got Corvid-19.

Jake Paul's ghost writer makes a trash song
Everybody all gangsta until jake Paul’s ghostwriter pulls up

Music that’s so bad it makes me want to listen to someone scream in agony
Sick🔥
🔥🔥
Anyone else didn't want to give a view but wanted to see what his ghost writer wrote.
All the little 10 yr olds in the comments getting pressed for people with an actual taste in music are ❄️. I hope someone slaps you to bring you back to reality and realize that this isn't music.
PAULS GOIN CRASY ANOTHER 1
Wanna be Mac millerrre
I hope all that money in the video goes to your ghost writer
This boy funny
he probably thinks he sounds like travis scott or sumn
Everyone dislike
I been subscribed for over 12 years
Tbh..... I kinda like this song
Bro this slaps on mute  🔥🔥
Nice ghost written
Did anyone else see his face glitch at 0.54
It’s a hit
Disney- 😅 Never seen him before
oh no
Why the hat jus give him props there’s a reason why he barely makes any yt videos any more
Give him the crown. The best rapper/influencer.
When tiko raps better than you
White boy youtubers are rappers now. Can’t come up with their own bars so they pay for bars and claim they came up with it and voila a rapper
I wonder who wrote this one
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Shout out I saw it live
This song is sick keep on going beast
This is as good as fresh outta London but at least designer isn’t in the video he just wrote the song

i cant believe im saying this but....                                                  i actually like the song-
Can we all make this the most dislikes vide of 2020
I just threw up. There have to be at least 10 K other people who feel the same.
I mean okay, but it's Jake Paul so it's instantly trash
Obviously a ghost writer wrote it
This the monthly horror for 2020
1:33 looks like a toddler dancing to Baby Shark
This is lit 🔥🔥🔥
Sir, you swore.

Where all that money come from 😂? What's his job
Does he think he’s cool
Why in the hell was this even recommend,   Jake Paul’s the type of dude to loot  Then say yep it was all me!

Ghostwriter snapped on this 😤
Yuh yuh🔥🔥🔥     This crap on fire🔥💩🔥 call it crap fire🔥

Ghostwriter just made another bag
This guy is so cringe
Proud to be one of the downvote and run crew.
I wonder if when they’re filming these they ever stop and think like like holy this is cringey
2020 has gave us everything bad in the same year
Damn Jake great job fam! Song is lit just like Fresh Outta London!
Yall do know Your favorite musician has ghost writers right? From rap to pop etc all use ghost writers. From Sia writing a bunch of Rhiannas and a whole lot more including Beyoncés hits ,to quinton writing some drake hits to all of 6ix9ines songs being written by someone else.
My loyalties would lie with Jj considering the years I’ve watched him but you can’t deny that these two songs Jake has released are bangers and that’s keeping it 💯
Vibe 👏👏👑
Why did I click on this?
Songs below 2 minutes are stupid asf

His ghost writer is making some nice music.

I’m a really solid KSI fan for the past 6-7 years now,anything he’s been through I’ve always sided with him but if you say that Jake’s new songs aren’t fire you’re simply lying to yourself
Omg what the heck he got a beard 🤨
It’s times like these when I wish I was deaf
His first decent was I’m single then these days then fresh outta London and this is pretty good
wow notice how the only comment he pinned was the only good one lol
FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Gonna hear 5 year olds blast this on gta online

Jake Paul: look i have money, i have actresses, i have rented cars, i have large house, i am so so incredibly better than u KSI: makes fans feel like his friends, humble, hard worker, charismatic, fare, has humility, is insanely wealthy but doesn't flaunt it unironically

This is disrespectful to jordan
Finally u drop a banger
Song name 23, Has 23k dislikes.  I love democracy.
Garbage this aint the one homie
Why is he so self conscious about having a ghost rider? I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that in my opinion as long as you’re releasing quality songs
Looks like the FBI is gonna break into his again to see who wrote his lyrics
Jake you are a living legend rn you used to be clingy asf but now your lit bro keep it up
Jake better drop nate 23 times
Trash
Good vibe
Lance
CMON EVERYONE DISLIKE!
the first one was good but this wasnt it cheaf
Call me it's kane
Jake's ghostwriter is getting better.
3 hooks and 1 unfinished verse saying nothing....seems legit.
BORING!!!
This song is terrible and whoever disagrees is a pedo
Trash
Diarrhea
The beat carries and you can’t even deny it
Keep making videos king
You know I thought he was canceled but whatever but at the same time I can't be the only one that thought he was canceled
Never thought i would like dis song
23 is my lucky number since that was the day I was born. Thank you for ruining it you bastard😁
This is listenable
His music is trash 🗑
I’m waiting for the “cyber bully” to react to this Mr Struggle Song
Can i take back my view
Fire😎
He deserves a like
Who’s listening to this and remembered his ItS EvErYDaY BrO and then you where like Logan’s so much better than Jake an now your just like 🤨
Hot trash
It's eh
Bruh his songs hit different now like damn dude
Gg
This was booty cheeks 😂
Why does he still release these crap? Hes a walking cancer.
Cringe
Kill jasper is confirmed to be Jake's ghost writer. Look up his song "kill intro". It sounds exactly like Jake's new songs after Jake had jasper write songs for him.
Bruh why tf is this actually fire?
This song hard
straight ass
tiene copy??
Nobody asked
better than ksi
Hot hot🤘🔥
Jake Paul: complains people nitpick what he does  Also Jake Paul: gets house raided, throws no mask parties, participated in riots and looting
I want to meet Jake's rap coach cause he's 2 up now.
23k dislikes. Nice
I'm ready for KSI vs Jake
BOOOOOOO
He got that disney channel flow lolll
This is disrespectful to Jordan

Is that a Bentley?
Stay in school kids
This is kinda lit
Who tf wrote this? Your flow and lyric writing ability just can’t go from “It’s Every Day Bro” to this and the last song.
Bro I was wondering where Jake was and then I saw him drop this I was like oh the studio that lives in his house
Y did I think that cashnasty was sitting next to jake paul🤦🏽‍♂️
he is still on the internet how embarrassing LMFOA IM SORRY
Did Jake legit remove my comment i just said he shouldn't be smoking when he knows his fanbase is mostly 8 - 10. C'mon now.
When I was younger we made fun of people who would claim music is dead because we thought all new music sucked. Having said that...  Music is dead. This is terrible. A barely 2 minute song about cars, money, and thinking that banging girls makes you better than other people. Just shoot me.
no thank you
🥳👍🏻
And once again... It's the rise of the paul's.
The beard is gross. I just came to say that. Thx
So many different words in this 2 min song.
0:15 good to see jakes finally going to pay back the IRS
FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is bad
damn that prop money musta been a bitch to print
Groovy
I wanna hear dababy rap on this beat so bad
ok, no cap but Jake Pauls's music is really fire like I can't deny it.  🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Am I the only one who loves his songs now
No❤️
It ain’t great but It’s definitely something I could sit and listen to while chilling
Both the Paul brothers coming back this year huh?
🔥🔥🔥🔥, this man done got way better
idk how anyone is hating on this song, if you didn't know this was jake paul and it didn't have a music video, you all would be loving it.  Sounds exactly like 90 percent of the music out right now. Thoroughly enjoy this track myself.

damn this song is fireeeeeeee, this is best jake paul song ever. keep it up jake

🔥

2020 is speaking a different language right now.
Is it me or did no one even understand what he was saying through half the song?
wtf is happening, 2020 is mad
Bruh
This bangs 🔥🔥🔥
big douche bag
I think these comments prove that Ksi is really the one with all the yes men @noire._.rose bro the kid made a mistake when was 14 like why is it so hard for the non blacks to forgive him like so many black people have forwarded saying stop bullying him like 90% if these non blacks have probably said the n word and act like this kid is a criminal.😂
I think it’s pretty cool that Jake Paul named this song as his IQ
Gotta give him the benefit of the doubt, this music he has been releasing is good
why people like this is beyond me
Pretty cool song but I think maybe you forgot to make it good
bruh I've been listening to this like 5 times now haha
I think these comments prove that Ksi is really the one with all the yes men 😂
Brooo catchy af
This is pretty fire ngl 💯
This good but u prefer straight outta London
Why does this song sound like no suburban 2 by sheff g?

When life gives you hundred's of reasons to cry, show life that you have thousands of reasons to smile.
Good one
Pure trash 🤮🗑
Jake Paul: Realises a music video  Me: Searching something about its everyday bro

Challenge to get 1 million with no videos,let's break the game💪💪
Best thing ever    The first time i saw jack paul he was jumping off of a helicopter,and i thot the he was some privileged white boy
Damn, money can't buy talent or a good ghost writer.. Stick to being a douche and robbing homes with your friends, it's a better look than trying to rap.
mabye jake can go back to him old self and always post for the 20 mill subs
Ngl jake Paul has stepped it up
Why did he do the 2 3 like that at the end? “👌🏼” 🥴
Bruh if u u did a 24 song so much better he’s out Jordan man

ghostwriter went harder than a mf
Its a sin in my culture to like Jake Paul even if it's good
We that’ song isn’t hard to memorise...
Better then ksi
Ksi actually lives rent free in this guys head 😂😭
“Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire” “good luck” 💸
The transition from fresh outta London is crazy
Haha now your breathing manually
did desiigner write this too or..?
Hi my name i Jake I do crazy stuff like u loved the vid It would really mean a lot if I come see you for first airplane trip
The only reason I came to this video was to dislike

“Jake Paul’s ghost writer makes another hit song, arguably”
That might be the worst song in the history of mankind. These to cats are off the mark
This fire 🔥
It's aright, but doesn't belong to the Trend
Where the barfbag I need one
His music really improved good for him!!!

His songs is getting better thru time. That's maturity XD
Music isn’t for everyone 😊👍🏼
Give me my 2 mins back....
Name of the song represents how many "friends" Jake Paul had that went bar for bar with him in the studio
It is just me or is Jake Paul actually getting good at rapping
Hes 2 for 2 for releasing a song when ksi does.
Ok Jasper 🔥
I bet some had to write the lyrics for Jake cause last time he got some to help him beat jj
This must be an alternate universe       His music is okay      Unlike his     EvErYdAy bRo
I'd rather watch Belle Delphine...
Hey jake, who wrote this?
Ya
Is all that money from looting?
How can someone be so bad, ewh.
Can we get more Jake mini Jake Paul

WHY DOES THIS HAVE LIKES
We needed this in 2020. Jake Paul making good songs never thought I’d see it but here we are. What’s coming next?
Wow
It's a shame the beat I'd basically stolen from ROCKSTAR
let’s play a game who wrote the song A. Designer B. Any other good musician Notice how there is no jake Paul option
I want to make a song with you guys are
I thought he was quitting
You know that it's a good song when you have to see the subtitles

2020 worst year   2020: be prepared for a trash song   Me: oh no jake pauls back oh nooooooo!!!

Oh dang, there's a new Dumb and Dumber movie coming out?

This song makes me want to commit Yeetus Deleteus
CNN has confirmed: There is no ghost writer.

Joey nato made itttttt let’s fkn goooo
I only wanted to see Logan's part and that's it..
Killjxpers back must be hurting after carrying this song.
Why are songs so short these days?
Nice ghostwriter 😁👍
I feel like the comments pinned by Jake Paul are accounts made by *him* so that he convinces us there are Paul fans about there.
🗑
Where are the Ksi Army for the dislikes ?
Who thought this is what we needed in 2020? 😒
Jake: Singing on the roof Grandma: Get out of my house!
He's leveling up slowly I love it
Dude do something good with your money get over your self... your just repeating everything that rappers do , do you donate to charity or something
Oh my hes still alive?
I’ve been a Jake Paul fan since 2017, and compared to its everyday bro this is gold
Bro this is fire. If jake’s writing this, mind blowing work.
Sounds the exactly the same as his last song
I love how influencers get paid for people to judge them and laugh at them 🤣
Why did he compare himself to Jorden?
This is the first time really listening to Jake Paul and I must say this ain't my last 😈
Did you credit the goastwriter???
It’s a lot better than the other trash songs no lie
He isn’t even the star of his own video
Is anyone going to talk about how he smokes?
I would argue this was waaaay too short!!!
Jake Paul is the 🐐
Anyone wondering where Oscar the grouch went well this is him now
I know how most of yall feel bout this dude but from strictly a music standpoint this isn't that bad
no ❤️
Damn...🔥
Well atleast we know he wrote this one. Lol
I pity people who like this song
The best time to delete this was when it was released, the second best time is now
I ain’t about this negativity do your thing Jake 💯
"Got the paparazzi at the front of my door"  More like the FBI at the front of your door
Can’t ghost write lines that Have been used hundreds of times already
This is fire🔥🔥
This song makes absolutely no sense, even if it did.       It. Didn't.
Jake is only getting started
Jake Paul: I need to print some money. The FED: Hold my ink.
This is fire yall haters can't say nothing about this
He speaks the truth happen to his life
Idk now what to say its another good song by jake... what has this world become...
This actually sounds good
Hears this song and want him to get one more 23 so comments “get him 2.3mil subs”
Holy crap this bops     *When mute*
Eww
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damnnnn the ghostwriter went off 🔥🔥🔥
This ghost writer is very talented wll done jake
im pretty sure if Jake Paul would have just started making music from the beginning and nothing else, he likely would have made it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OF RAP YOU ARE MAKING A MOCKERY
Jake paul.. My guy.... is there anythint you can't do? 🤘
Anyways🤦🏿‍♀️✨ what y’all want from the store
Is it me, or are all of the lines repeated? I hear the same words repeated like there were only 10 words used to write this song.
Who is watching the boxing match on sat. I think NO I know Jake is winning this match. GOOD LUCK JAKE MAKE THE JAKE PAULERS PROUD.

i feel like this dude is doing really good with his songs, the last one and this one fire keep it up tho
You know damn well he didn’t write his own lyrics        His music changed ever since desiigner made his lyrics from last song

Jake Paul fans seriously have low expectations for his music but what can I expect since they are all kids who have never heard good music in their lives!
its good but its still obvious that he didn't write this...
he legit sounds like drakes voice
Wonder who wrote this one??🤔🤔
This is garbage
Staring Jake paul
ok jake i see u tho
This just proves that no matter if you're a shitty person, you can do anything if you got the bag 😩😩😩🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶😤😤😤💰💰💰💰💰
You know he tryna act like a "rapper" bc he wasn't smoking weed by in his prime days
Another song another ghost writer
WHAT IS THIS
Jake his realy hoing up 🔥👑🔥
Nobody: The comments hoping to be noticed by jake by getting likes and then editing their comment to heal his ego: "Only one person who likes this comment will be a billionaire!"
hope this one wasnt written by designer just waiting for ksi to expose him again lmao
Better than KSI👌
This was unexpected
no...just- no what is this
Money changed this nigga bro I swear
Do you guys see that?  Why can't you guys see it?  Cause I see it...  I see...             IMPROVEMENT!
This song is decent but  Straight outta London was better.  And yes he wrote both
He wants to be a Professional boxer but he’s smoking how does that work?
Jake why was your house raided by the fbi??
Didnt know he smoked weed. I like em now, fellow stoner
another disney star taken from drugs 😔

I swear he used hella alot of auto tune, he sounds horrible
Good but u pretty much copied the same flow and such and ur last song be original.
Fire🔥
He probably didn’t write the song
Ah yes cultural appropriation at its finest
Bruh Jake got be bumming to his songs now his songs are fireee
Drop an album already
All the haters in the comments . In the first place why are u here
I can 100% confirm its a ghost writer.
Let’s be honest, Jakes last 2 songs are better than any song KSI has ever dropped
Lol, the writer isn’t listed in the credits. I wonder why...
nice writers
Ion even like jake Paul but this shi 🔥
jake didn’t write this shi 😭

IMAGINE LIKEING THIS
I came to judge, but left impressed.
I just want a chaotic vlog
This hit hard but who is the ghost writer 🤔
Who else was surprised and expected it to be trash but found it was pretty decent
Lets go prlm child !!
3sum is still better
There is no way he doesn't have a ghost writer and since i'm 99.9% sure he does this song gets a trash from me but if he actually wrote this by himself comgrats and my bad
2020 is one weird year.
Good job desiigner, next time you should add some more creative verses, repeating the same thing for 2 minutes is kind of boring
Ksi richer than u
Wack
I can’t believe I just sat through the entire thing to hear Logans part and it didn’t even come worst 2 min of my life
Aye whoever wrote this for you fire af
Congrats on getting your mv on vevo 👏🏼
I love his new music. This song is 🔥🔥

As a Jake Paul hater this is low-key a banger and that should say a lot.
Does anyone else think that this was actually a great song from jake a guy who sang a song and has the most disliked video on youtube
In the words of David Hasselhoff: THIS IS A MESS

While I very much like Jake and have been subscribed to his channel since just hit like a million subscribers like 4-5 years ago I’m sad to realize none of his songs will ever have the same success that his song it’s everyday bro had because that song has 300 million views and probably well over a billion downloads between Apple and Spotify
Waiting for ricegum,s diss track on this one.

YES SIRRR 🤟🏾
14 second hook played 4 times + 28 second verse = 42 seconds. Written bar for bar means 42/2 meaning he only wrote 21 seconds of the song which I guess even for him isn't too unbelievable. Must've been a really hard 21 seconds to write
To be honest this kinda lit 🥵🔥🔥
KSI be like Jake didn’t wright this
KSI is still better.
This beats tho
Jake is always hooking up with women even in music videos
Every person paid by Jake Paul to comment good things about this song stfu
Jake mate KSI and you have to make a song  🔥🔥
Damn another banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥

I like the last one more this one is still great tho! Great job jake
Does he write it tho?
6ix9ine X Jake Paul? Dare or what?
Yet another song with ghostwriters...
Why does he always have to brag about how rich he is 😐
For the first time I'm about to actually click pause on the video to go download a youtuber's track, and I never thought it would be a Jake Paul track. This is my weekend track. And I'm from Africa!!!
another banger here comes the haters
Did this idiot write at the bottom “KSI’S songs keep getting worse” is he mad i am mad 😤😤😤😡😡👿👿🗯🗯

Where's my Dislike gang?
Gotta admit his new songs ARE FIRE 🔥
I’m the guy that went into jake Paul’s old house and exposed his herpes medication and more.  I have to say. This song is trash. I used to be a jake Paul fan. But his beard is so fakking ugly that I just can’t. He’s way too full of himself these days.
The writing under the news made me laugh
I highly doubt he wrote that
Who wrote this?
Jake Pol I can't believe  Out of prison

"Yes I’m fuckin her and her friend  I like em two at a time "  Refers to Mark Dohner's  3 Sum.  1:04 " Haters are punching the air and accusing him of ghost writer" bringing up Ksi's comment. If you look down " Ksi's song keep getti..."  Nice.

No where near fresh out of London but still better than all of your other "songs"
Bro jakes songs are kinda fire now ngl
Still a good track, definitely a step back from Fresh outta London tho. He needs to either add one more verse into his songs, or have a beat change, or both.

Posing with flash cars and money isn’t a personality it’s stupid.  How this whole album be created:  1: Find some shitty beat off the internet 2: Use it for every song  3: Find a guy to write some lyrics about how you’re the greatest person ever 4: sing it in some shitty monotones auto tune while trying your best to look like a dickhead
I wonder if he actually wrote this one🤔
Wtf did I get myself into
this is fire 🔥

JAKE THIS IS COOL AND I LOVE IT also saved it

NDL
Jake Paul is getting better at rapping
waaaahhh <3
reading through the comments, how the HELL do people still support him?   the guy literally got put in jail for having illegaly owned GUNS, makes suggestive comments when he knows his demographic is mostly 7 to 12 year olds.  so in short, he made money by sexually clickbaiting minors into thinking they were gonna see some random internet chick naked
Holy fck how this is good
love it  siten on 23
ghostwriters for daysss
this is all right but outta Landon  was better

This is meh, Fresh Outta London was way better
Jake should’ve used real footage from the FBI raid & paparazzi in the intro, it’s all real
Bro this guys new music is lowkey beter

Please write your own songs
Bruh this literally has the exact same flow as Sheff G - No Suburban pt.2. This guy uses ghostwriters and steals flows😂😂
He makes hits now I’m impressed ✊🏻✊🏻👏👏👏👏
I am a KSI fan and I feel like jake has changed so much as a person he has changed for the better and I like his new music to be honest with you
Old vs New Jake writing vs his ghost writer

Fun fact: Though many are lead to believe otherwise, Jake Paul actually stopped writing his music in 2017 after Its Every Day Bro was released. Now the Vine celebrity has other people write his songs while he gets all the credit.

These ghost writers are good
*When u think that he did alot of progress after hearing “Fresh Outta London” and then arrive this.*      Didn’t expect it could be even worse than “It’s Everyday Bro”.
That's amazing 💯💯💯
Honestly Fresh Outta London was way better...Jake said this was better than Fresh Outta London...But this is trash compared to that
Whoever reads this, Jesus love you and wants you to follow him. He’s the only way to Heaven.
Bro this song is a banger and still KSI is gonna a have a negative response to it
Jakes on to something with this music thing. If he gets a big name to feature it could be over ❗️🔥🔊

Ghost writers did good
Jake once again launched a BANGER  Ksi:- ohk, lez check his ghostwriters
ok fresh outta London was decent but this...           is so bad.
all the comment section: “Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire” “good luck” 💸 (everyone likes that) me: ohhh lala logahn pauhl oui oui ouiiii 🇫🇷🥖 *with french accent*
Love the song man
if you’re hating , YOURE TRASHHH
Good song FOL better imo

this is awsome ma gggggg
Who from cz or sk
His songs are getting better and better
Bro idk why this guys music just catchy and nice
fucking fireeeee
Hm broo, Fresh Outta London was even like better. This one sounds like he’s just rapidly talking or something different.
This sounds better than ksi songs
So you went from a YouTuber with a fan base entirely made of kids to a rapper who smokes, drinks and has sex with all these women? I really do feel bad for anyone that thought of you as a role model because you’re driving everyone in the wrong direction now
Jake said on impaulsive that it was "him and one friend" that wrote his last song. However that 'friend' has no credits and is therefore the definition of a ghostwriter. Same deal here no doubt.
This is pretty good ahahaha
If Jake Paul got a durex ad they wouldn’t make any money because all of his fans are 9 year olds
Lets goo
Wholy jake getting so good.  This song is so fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
look at Spotify and who wrote it is shows no-one
Fresh out London is way better

Tbh the more you listen to it the more you start to like it
Two at a time is how to get an std 🙂

KSI is never gonna admit this song is fire. He’s gonna be like ohh he got another ghost writer.
FIRE🔥🔥
I am a big KSI fan, but I can’t lie, jake really putting out good songs that appeal to an audience where as ksi kind of just randomly switching genres and none of them slap
Ayo kill jasper been w u lately Jake?

This song is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so bad!

Why is this good for a jake paul songM
Bro make volgs na
I like how he says people will accuse him of ghost writers when he literally called KSI’s music trash and said he doesn’t write it. Yet this dumbass literally admitted that he had a “friend” who went bar from bar with him, and that friend who wrote half the song according to jake wasn’t listed as a writer which means he is a ghost fucking writer
Did we help just so he can brag  about his money and smoke weed we helped him achieve the money
It's just the same thing for 1 and a half minutes
johh weldone hard work paid off
He been smoked weed
Why is this good why how
😂😂😂😂

I came to judge I left impressed
Very Good song
People are talking about ghostwriting and comparing him to ksi. Jake paul actually sounds like someone whos been in the game for years. His flow and cadence sounds better than some of the rappers we got in the industry. I like ksi's music too but you can't deny jake paul has been working on his craft.
I was watching this then I switched to Addison Rae TikToks when my brother walked in. Easier to explain.
Cool
Who wrote this?
Wowowowwoowwowowowow
And he thinks he can start with music....
Me waiting for JJ's reactions 👀

I’ve never had anything against Jake, but I never liked his music, but know I feel like I can blast this in a car with an aux
Best
Honestly I got chills
I don t care what anyone says jake is better than ksi at rapping. Ksi just relies on his features to carry him
Jake
Yo dope song but start making vlogs please
My man think he found the formula for success and he's just running with it
Ksi has no chance
Jake knows he’s dropping bangers
Dayum another banger 💪🏾😈😈

No one: KSI; lEtS chECK hIS mOnThLY LiSteNers

Music : 7.5/10  Video : 8/10  Trash to lit music : 10/10  GG.
Proud of this man
(I'm a ksi fan) this song is decent but its soooooo clear that Jake didnt write it because he didn't write it. U cant improve that much in a few months, it takes years of practice and tones of songs to be able to improve that drastically. Also he changed 'his' style so much too. If u think he wrote this HIMSELF then u a biiiiigggg clown
Fireeeeeeeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow his music is actually good😳
Do anything if it doesn’t cost money
So was this ''BAR FOR BAR'' Aswell?
Ok, I’m just now waiting for Jake Paul ft 6ix9ine now...
