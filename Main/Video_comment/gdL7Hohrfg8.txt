Penalty and red card? Just a penalty? Or nothing? Let us know what YOU think! 👇
who came from man utd 4 brighton 2 ahahahha and brentford 3 liverpool 2 wheyyy
wow
I miss this Chelsea :(
Not a pen or a red for me. Arm is too close and it comes off his thigh. Liverpool are very lucky
Liverpool are do bad they can't beat 10 men Chelsea 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came back to see if it was a red cause of the petition. It is. This is the one I dont agree with
Hamball
clear red card as he deliberatley used his arm to clear the ball off the line. penalty and red.
James is a legendary defender he is really underrated, that red card was also completely unnecessary. Yes a pen and a yellow but 100% not a red. Fair play to him for keeping the ball out on the line 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I’m a kid and when Chelsea scored a Liverpool fan through a bottle and hit me.last night in the post I got a lettter from Reece James telling me not to worry about it and the best part he is my favourite player❤️
Best believe chelsea will finger looserpoool later on in the season.. they got nothing on us
Salah or Lukaku?  Like for Salah!  Comment for Lukaku!
To all chelsea fans who are mad ab this, just bc james didn’t do a luis Suarez vs ghana or steve cook vs norwich doesn’t mean he didn’t block the goal with his arm, it’s a red any day
Liverpool could have won 2-1
Liverpool fan. Penalty? All day Red card? Harsh
CD DB Chelsea have won Five Premierships numerous FA Cups League Cups Two Champions Leagues Super Cups. How can Chelsea win  before a ball is kicked?. That is 'Illogical". You and Lizzie Gunn are "Omniscient". She would comment, on my "Punctuation". which is my concern They must have played, "Convincingly". to have won all those "Trophies". You are both, "Anti Chelsea". At least, nearly all their players can score. Unlike other teams,  Namely, Liverpool, Leicester City, Manchester City.
Lizzie Gunn I don't need an education in grammar. You are guessing wrongly. I passed O Level in English Grade A write actual sentences is what ii means. How do you know pundits, know more than me?. Are you "Clairvoyant"?. I know pundits have been players including wiseacre Shearer. They are not needed. They "State the  Obvious". The former, for about £300000, yearly. His team Blackburn, won The Premiership once, in 1995. On Goal Difference He features, every other week. That's where the Licence Fee goes. Most of the BBC drama, is violent, or melodramatic. I agree with Jan Leeming. It should be annulled.
Chelsea are usually the one away team who go to Anfield and get a lot given to them. 2007/08 Chelsea were given a ridiculous penalty when Malouda went down. 2008/09 Bosingwa stamped on Yossi Benayoun's back and got nothing for it. Unbelievable decision. 2009/10 Not decisions as such (they got plenty in the rest of their games that season) but Liverpool threw the game gave Chelsea the points because it was the first year ManUtd could go above Liverpool on league titles hence Gerrard's deliberate backpass to Drogba at 0-0. Supposed to be a hard fixture, Liverpool won at all costs when ManUtd came to Anfield that season. 2013/14 Another gift from Gerrard 2014/15 Goal line technology giving Chelsea a goal that so many others had denied vs Chelsea when goal-line technology wasn't used for such incidents. Liverpool also should've had a pen in a handball incident, wasn't given. Etc... But I'm still not surprised by Chelsea's trademark whining on the rare time they don't get favoured.
Chelsea never did explain how they managed to pay for their buddy Martin Atkinson to officiate 5 Chelsea cup semi-finals in less than 10 years?? Talk about having no shame in the corruption of English officiating since the Abramovic era.
You can clearly see Reece James try to lift his knee up to block it appalling VAR decision
It was a penalty and a red card, why not?
Believe that if Marcos alonso didn’t head the ball mendy would have gotten the ball and James wouldn’t have received a rash red card
Good game by the reds
Let's go Milan. Siempre Milan ♠️♥️
What happened to your saviour Lukaku must of had his good spell already.
Yh
chealsea shoud have won
The adjoining america consequently number because father-in-law encouragingly imagine until a terrific hubcap. broken, hoc soprano
Liverpool aren’t there yet….
YOU CAN CLEALY SEE JAMES SWING HIS ARM TO GET AWAY FROM THE BALL, THE BALL HIT HIS THIGH FIRST, NATURAL INSTINCT IS TO KICK BALL AWAY, WITHOUT HIS ARM HIS THIGH WOULDVE REACHED HIGH ENOUGH TO REACH IT. TERRIBLE DECISION, HOPE HE NEVER REFS AGAIN THE FRAUD
Don’t worry they’ll come to our home 🔵🔵🔵
Chelsea are a different animal since FL left
how did matip miss the header
by the rules of the game it was a red. he stopped the ball from crossing the line with his hand.
Swear I see no Liverpool fans clapping or cheering/getting excited and the noise comes through, fraud fans?
It bounces off his knee and hits his arm. That’s ball to hand. The PL refs are pure plastic nowadays. Forget rules. They just do whatever they like.
I support Tottenham so Chelsea is a rival but Reece James didn’t deserve a red poor refereeing
So this is what happens when your owner backs the manager, I mean the turnaround from Chelsea because they sign players unlike fsg Liverpool standing still while everyone else gets stronger
Great rearguard display by Chelsea showing grit and determination led by captain fantastic Azpilicueta.
Tuchel is exactly what Chelsea needed.  Just the penalty would've been fair. In honesty, they should have just given the goal and not a penalty.  That's the fairest outcome. Prevents the Suarez thing from happening.
NO WAY?? Salah scored another penalty?🤣🤣🤣 pen merchant
Well done sky you found Lukaku one and only touch
Whining Liverpool fans got Martin Tyler removed from the game, just because he's not a cheerleader for Liverpool.
Jesus Christ Anthony Taylor, he literally looked at a picture to make his decision
Honestly, it may be a harsh red, but if his hand wasn't in the way, the ball goes in; it's not even doubtful. Yet, by getting sent off and being awarded a penalty, Liverpool's chances go from scoring a 100% goal, to having a 50/50 chance of scoring the penalty.  I wish there was a way to award a goal, and a yellow without the harsh Red Card-Penalty rule. Would avoid harsh red cards, and needless penalties.
1:22 Chelsea fans reacted  And 1:26 Chelsea fans goes in rage on Anthony Taylor call him Worst referee since the FA cup final against arsenal  (Just a penalty instead of both.) (Well we all know that he tried to make he’s decision, but he made every fans angry because of their decision.)
That's never a red card Liverpool got lucky
Another headline ..... the best team in Europe and current European champions  drop 2 points against a resilant Liverpool
Absolutely brilliant defensive performance from us
Why can’t referees explain their decisions after the game?
We're done.  We ain't gonna win the league or champions league... perhaps for a long time - again.  Should of signed more players by learning from the mistakes of last year.   We're gonna have 2 of our front 3 gone in January. Add to that the injuries that WILL HAPPEN. We're done.   We didn't replace Lovren and look what happened. When are we going to replace Wini?
Jorginho trolling us with the blonde hair
Ref was awful, literally double standards all over the pitch,  hell bent on booking chelsea players and hell bent on keeping Liverpool players out of the book. He literally ruined a fascinating game.
Why’s everyone laying into Arsenal in the comments when they’re not even playing?
Chelsea are hard to beat especially if you use your hands on the goal line that’s blatant cheating by Chelsea
Good
The ref hasn't seen it. He has now.
Two points dropped by Chelsea
Bro the ref didn't even look at the monitor properly and he gave a red card. Lol
Why isnt nobody talking about how lukaku is still in Matips pockets nevermind Van Dijks
Lukaku failing to deliver the fantasy points this game week
I can’t imagine being in James’ position
Chelsea played much better
Definitely a penalty, the red card did seem harsh but looking back as t it, he did have his arm in a bad position, that was never gonna help his case, tough call but yellow would of been sufficient
I felt liverpool were the better team tbh, they were more attacking in both halves, had more of the ball, credit to Chelsea for keeping it at 1_1 but that's a task made easy by having all your players in your own half, going on the first half I would of expected to see more from chelsea moving up the field after all the money they've spent in recent years
Sky condemn the chants against chelsea. But dont condemn all the anti liverpool scouse discrimination we face against everybody we play? Sign on, robbers, smackheads, etc. Horrible company. 🐀🐀🐀
Anyone else’s notice when Henderson went for Mandy big rom just came in with his chest and sent hendo on his way 😂😂
Huge point for Liverpool against the best the in europe
In 2nd half Chelsea got 13 free kicks out of 20 challenges from LFC...out of 30 challenges from Chelsea....Liverpool got 0 free kicks ...after the Burnley display from the ref its obvious the refs have an agenda against liverpool
Cesar aspilacuta excuse the spelling was a disgrace with his play acting today
Red card defo and penalty even as a Chelsea fan I could see that ,James first contact the was nothing he could do and would not of been sent off . but when scooped it out on his second touch ..James let Chelsea down .
Havertz's header is underated
Cracking game both teams look so strong
Tbh I think Chelsea gonna win the league they looking solid
Only if Chelsea could win but o well😭😭
so many chances for liverpool shouldve been 2-1 but it is what it is
Can we just remember these are title contenders 😂 think everton are better are more like title contenders
Lukaku though wanted to get on W the game instead of taking the knee and he’s a black player lmao couldn’t stop laughing anyone else notice this
Why is no talking bout havertz goal
I can’t believe people think that’s a red it hits his leg first then pings up onto his arm. Give the penalty by all means since it did stop the goal still but it’s never a red card nothing deliberate about that…. Ruined the game too was such a snooze fest second half
The small fight thing after the penalty compared to my local team Wrexham v Eastleigh
Still can’t believe that second chance we had both lukaku and mount just ignores Havertz could have been 2-0
Chelsea's defense might be their weak spot this season. Both red and pen btw.
Liverpool no chance for any trophy this season
Ref was a Chelsea fan today. Giving free kicks for dives countless times.
I respect that performance from Chelsea as a Liverpool fan
As a liverpool i would of taken a draw before the game so im fine with this
As a neutral this game was amazing to watch but gives me concerns for when we face them later this season
0:24 "he means it" - he rly doesn't he tried to flick back as a pass. couldnt do it again for another 100 times. Love how the liverpool dominance before that goal was not shown - goal was completly against run of play and all these ppl who didnt watch the game will never know it. makes me sad. call me salty if u want, but liverpool deserved to win the game. chelsea defence? all they did was header the ball out, bruh not that amazing.
Definitely a penalty but no need for the red card.
These highlights are not a fair reflection of the game at all. Liverpool dominated and deserved the win. Why couldn’t you show us how Rüdiger was scuffing up the pen spot and more of Chelsea’s dirty tactics.
Probably was a red card and sending off but Taylor's lack of proper VAR screen scrutiny is what caused the issue...clearly VAR had told him to look at the screen but all he did is look at a still image instead of looking at a video stream of the entire event...I expect the PGMO to publically reinforce the rules that refs need to use when using VAR screen reviews within the next 48 hours...
BE AWARE THE KING HAS ARRIVED BACK🛑🛑
Tuchel... lay on the floor holding your face and we get a draw....
big Sam parks the bus gets called a dinosaur tuchel does it and its a master class media bias much????
Great assist by Anthony Taylor again
As a neutral, the red was unnecessary and killed the game. Chelsea were beast 👍
It’s amazing what limitless pots of ill gotten cash can do for you.
2:00 what a ball that was
chelsea got robbed
LiVARpool strike again.  The only way they will win another prem title 🤣
wat a goal, best header ive seen since Bierhoff days
Vvd and matip pocketed lukaku today and everyone who watched the full match would’ve agreed
Alonso and the keeper were at fault for the Liverpool goal. No communication it seems.
THE REFEREE IS BIAS, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PENALTY. THIS IS A DAY LIGHT ARMED ROBBERY. AM MANCHESTER CITY MAN THOUGH
That was a red card. But Anthony Taylor strikes again for Chelsea.
Wasn’t a red
I don't think I have seen a more controversial game ever from that red for James and then Mendy starts trying to tackle Hendo clean
Havertz > Penandes
Dude. Red cards for stuff like that need to be taken out of the rules. Red cards ruin the enjoyability of a game should only be given for dangerous play imo.
you know what i think the reason chelsea fans are being so salty in the comments is because a win at Anfield would have put them top of the league and would have been a statement victory and their crying because that didn't work out for them. Still regardless aside from the goal Liverpool played better 11 vs 11 Chelsea were lucky to be 1-0 up and did nothing else in the first half. At the end of the day the league was not going to be decided today, chelsea could have beaten us and lost to Man city and Man united and we could have won and done the exact same. Anyway the relegation battle will be good this year, I hope Arsenal stay up, I love to see a small team stay up against all the odds, it really warms the heart.
Would HENDERSON have been a pro footballer if he grew up in any other country? Literally ZERO footballing ability. Its like the football is his enemy. No control ... no touch... no ability.
Chelsea deserved the point they defended very well 2nd half but some of the behaviour from the Chelsea players when Reece James was sent off was very poor.
All these people saying no red it was an accident... read the rules. FA - Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct; SENDING-OFF OFFENCES  A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off: denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area).  Accidental or not it is still a penalty & and a red card offence. Chelsea showed immense resilience to hold on to the point fair play to them, but it was the correct decision.
Henderson acting like he scored the pen
This is why we are Champions league winners real team
Even as a big Liverpool fan, I can admit it should have been a red, was a pen but didn't look like he punched the ball away  Max a yellow since it was on the line
Burnley twice on the bounce at home is always tough to break down
Dodgiest ref goin
Anyone going to say anything about Diogo Jota’s follow up on Reece’s leg? 🤣
In the first half the ref let alot of small fouls go to help the flow of the game. He must have forgot about this at half time. Because in the second half he blew for absolutely anything.  Alonso actually fell over at one point on the ball with noone touching him and got a free kick.
Sadly again It was a red card by the letter of the law I am a referee at academy level so I have to deal with these things in memos Do not blame Antony Taylor for the decisions because the balls has bounced backwards off his leg so is still travelling towards goal Then it hits the hand which has slight movement towards the ball
Liverpool we’re a class above Chelsea yesterday, think Chelsea are a solid good team with lots of potential but I don’t think they are favourites to win the league they did well to hang on to 1-1
They all trying to give it large knowing the best player in the world is back at United :D
Chelsea got very lucky vvd RULES
The battle for 5th or 6th is now truly on!
Liverpool at home with extra men and 1:1. Not bad Chelsea.  Haters can be quiet 🤫.
Fabinho didn’t get booked , how ?
Liverpool are so weak rn. Gotta love it!
The red was ridiculous it hit his arm without him knowing he then moved his arm with it which made it look worse but it’s a pen and a yellow at most
Terrible game. neither proved they are genuine challenges to United and will face tougher challenges in bid to get top 4
brilliant defending🤩London is blue
How the hell are Chelsea fans complaining about the handball and red card??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's red card
Everyone wrote us off at start of season because of  ‘no signings’. We are back and we’re here, we will challenge this year. If I was a betting man though I’d still pick Chelsea
Chelsea got tore apart in the second half constantly being dug out by their goal keeper
All Square in the big game of the Second weekend of the start of the Premier League Season with Two club whom no doubt will be scrapping the Honours come the End of the Season.
The difference between series a and the premier league for Lukaku is the players and defenders in general are faster, so he can't just knock the ball forward and outrun them. You can tell he thought of trying it a few times in the game lol
Never a red
Liverpool all but destroying them. They'll win the league. Huge message right here right now!
Anthony bald Taylor is an awful ref. Chelsea would of won that if he didn’t ruin the game
Leg went through which made the movement natural
Still dunno how that is a red card the leg came up naturelly
Chelsea and City are THE teams to beat this year. Damn, Liverpool couldn't get near a 10 man Chelsea. United won't be competing for top spot, so it's a Chelsea and City battle from here.
As a Liverpool fan i said that Chalsea was gonna definitely be a very tough game and they proved that even when going down a man I suppose a draw is better than a loss YNWA ❤ .. Bless up . ✌📿⚽️
Liverpools 11 babies couldn't get past 10 men of chelsea XD
Feel like the red card probably made the game harder for Liverpool. Tuchel has drilled them well defensively and Liverpool struggle in these sorts of low blocks.  Shame this game was this earlier in the season.
Was it a red card ?
My home Liverpool🔥💪🏼,
That’s a penalty all day obviously, but a red card? Disgraceful
Think Liverpool’s title win was just a fluke, they won’t win nothing for a while again.
the pl and the cl will be amazing this year , it the dawn of english clubs dominating europe for the next few years and now we got ronaldo i guess we are in the mix :P . its gonna be the english teams and psg in the semis of the cl for the next few years and its amazing for us all in english football .
liverpool only scored cuz of. a pen
Hate both teams so I'll happily take a draw never a knee
VAR, the perfect tool for match fixing officials. We have seen this before the last time LiVARpool won the Premiership. Ruins the game for everyone.
Big surprise Lukaku bottled it against another top 6 club that isn't arsenal , got pocketed by vvd all game
Red card seems extremely harsh he tried to clear it with his foot and it rebounded into his hand definitely not debilitate in my books.
At Stamford Bridge the "W" coming home.
Lukaku looks so uncomfortable running with the ball lol
Impossible to be a red. The ref should never ref an important game again.
If James hadn't pushed the ball away with his hand I think would maybe be overturned but oh well
Chelsea are to strong 😬 Liverpool need to buy. They’re standing still but this title is Chelsea’s to lose.
Liverpool need to learn how to finish  their chances. Should have put this game to bed.
Liverpool didnt create a single big chance against 10 men jesus christ
Always a red card, good refereeing
Chelsea deserve credit for how they nullified Liverpool's attack the whole game, let alone with 10 men! At the same time, Liverpool had no answer or plan B for the low block and compact defense in the box. We're gonna struggle if we don't find different avenues of attacking play against teams who like to sit and defend. It's time to introduce creative players who can get our front three into dangerous positions!
Chelsea got lucky with that goal but it wasnt a red and it defo was a penalty
Ref should not be allowed to manage a league game again. Too many biased decisions against Chelsea to referee a primer league again. No one will miss him. There are thousands of refs that  will do a proper job. Its just rediculous.
fair play to chelsea but we were awful today. if we didn’t get that penny we would’ve been beat. we tried to send it down the wing for a cross at least 10+ times and didn’t work once, we needed to switch up our attack.
As someone who has always loved the sport, want to congratulate Chelsea for their mastery defending, never giving up spirit despite being down to 10 men. I have always known you were going to be a threat when you gave us a 2-0 defeat behind closed doors. You have an amazing manager and I couldn't be happier for you guys. YNWA 👏❤️
0:36 and right here, if he played in Havertz, it would have been 2-1
What a disgraceful performance from Liverpool. There's no way they're getting top four this season
Var ruining football
RED
Liverpool had lukaku in there pocket let’s not lie now
100 percent a pen and a red. He fully swings his arm to the ball and to get it away. He might not do it on purpose but he does.
chelsea robbed never a red and a pen could easily be debated
Mendy is a class goalkeeper fp an I support united but props to ur gk
Reece James> TAA
Haha Liverpool always need a penalty
@1:51 lukaku is just what you need in any team. Absolute beast, everyone step down
From a City fan, Chelsea or United are winning this year
This is a dub for Chelsea, we should've gotten 3 points against 10 men
Van dijk ✌️😀
Another nugget big virgil has put back in his safe space not only he won every header against lukaku he had more shots on target as well... Once we get in our rhythm and are 100% fit we will be putting teams to the sword.. Up the redmen 🔴👍
I don’t know how that was a red for Reece James, terrible reffing.
That ball from mo salah 😍
Wait are people actually complaining about that Reece James decision? He follows through with his arm to deny a clear goal...
As a Arsenal fan i miss the passion shown in this match at arsenal matchs 😢
If Lukaku and Havertz were passing to each other, it could have easily been 3-0 in the first half. Goal was largely Alonso's fault - prevented Mendy from catching the ball. And tf was Thiago Silva doing when Jota had the header from Salah's cross? Still a good away game.
who else had the Reece James Barclays ad before the video?😂
penalty was the correct decision but a yellow at most.
That was clear penalty no excuse referee made a good decision
I’m a Liverpool fan, fair play to Chelsea defended well, was defo a pen but harsh with the red, I think the officiating was a joke the whole game very poor from the ref! It’s becoming a theme in the prem now in my opinion
defending against Liverpool is one thing but with ten men says it all! what a header 😍
Omg come on! People talking g about var helping liverpool out. It's clear that Reece james scooped his arm to keep the ball out
What an exciting game this was, gutted we didn't win but we put up a great performance against Liverpool with only 10 men, sensational header from havertz, he's going to be great this year like he was at the end of last season, fair play to Liverpool, was a tough game, I think both teams were close to getting a second goal, we had the best defence in Europe last season and it showed it in the second half, what a game! The Premier league will be interesting this season, its hard to say who's coming where man u got sancho varane and Ronaldo, we got lukaku and soon kounde, maybe Saul too on loan to buy, man city and Liverpool nothing apart from grealish for 100m lol, but both of the teams are good enough anyway, I think we will be top 3 100% I'm confident in this team tuchel has built, this season is going to be a good one!  Moment of silence for man city without a champions league trophy..............alright moment of silence done, good result for city against arsenal...to be fair though it is arsenal...they got excited about beating west brom's u23 b team lol arsenal suck atm and it makes me laugh because my grandad supports them haha
Maneeeeeee
I say this as someone who dislikes Liverpool but it was a penalty and to the letter of the law he had to get a red card, was it a harsh red? yes but the rule is clear he had to be given a red.
It is a red.If his hand wasn’t there it would have gone in. His own fault for not clearing the ball properly. It was accidental handball but idc.
Why can't the ref just give a penalty? Fair enough it hit his arm which stopped it going on, but it wasn't intentional.
1:45  take note azpilicueta. Henderson didnt roll on the floor like he’d been shot. You absolute disgrace of a player should be banned for feigning injury😤.      Sky/youtube stop removing the comments there is nothing wrong with them
Can somebody tell lukaku he can come out of hiding now Van dijk and Matip have left the stadium.
Liverpool scoring a pen to go level celebrating like they won the league edoard Mendy should have sat the cocky pricks down couldn't beat 10 men
The way Lukaku runs up and chest barges Henderson of Mendy😂😂, the man is a walking tank 1:48
If a penalty is given for illegal obstruction of a clear and obvious goal opportunity it is a red in all circumstances. I think some of you need to get clued up on the rules of the game. The referee doesn't get to choose the colour of the card there, it is literally written into the rules.
What happened to the double jeopardy rule?
Lukaku touch hasn’t improved much but his decision making has improved.
Anthony Taylors is an awful ref
One of those championship shouty commentators who'll never be Barry Davies.
Was good game. Chelsea was amazing, did so well to get a point from that game. Well played liverpool.
The ref (Taylor)was too excited to give penalty and red card. I understand it was a penalty but did it really needed a Red Card? I don’t think so
U see lukaku body Henderson aftee they scored the pen
Good reffing
I liked the way lukaku had mendys back hes only known him for 2 weeks
Didnt know havertz was playing til i seen these highlights…. And i was at Anfield
Fam when Henderson was pressing Mendy and then lukaku came straight away😂😂
Alisson Becker at fault how did he caught out by that header I still cant get my head around.. poor performance from alisson today
hey west ham still top, can they do a leicester
Was that really a red card? bit harsh.
I think once Chelsea went to 10 men we were crying out for Chamberlain to come on.... I feel his drive, pace and shooting from range would have caused that backline all sorts of problems. AOC may not be that consistent, but he does score important goals, and is more clinical than all our other midfielders.  This is just my opinion, so no horrible remarks please.
Sky sports absolutely hate the fact that Liverpool haven’t won
no red card, and how has mendy gotten a yellow for kicking a ball and making henderson jump - bloody horrendous Anthony Taylor is
Salah scored a good penalty
Arsenal: how did it end 1-1?
Mount costed them the draw
This is a win for Chelsea
can we talk about the havertz goal tho?
VVD looking scared of Lukaku
I agree I think he knew what he was up to
We were poor today. From Alison's poor positioning to Robbos and Manes poor display. We could not buy a goal. If this Liverpool squad thinks they are going to win anything on this display, I think they'll be in for a surprise!
Just a pen. I don’t think you can do much about your arms when the games in pace and the balls all over the place in real time
As a red I have to say I'm grateful for the point but that was a harsh penalty decision. It seems we still cant seem to distinguish between ball to hand and deliberate handball.
I thought that when a penalty is given there is no red card as it's seen as a double punishment?
Can see Chelsea winning the league in the coming seasons
Liverpool showed a complete lack of ambition inthe 2nd half , no initiative to break Chelsea down , only positive was Harvey Elliot, kids a diamond
I expect Anthony Taylor to be serving fries in McDonalds come monday morning.
The Chelsea keeper is World  class
Ffs why did the manager change the team that played against Burnley
why is nobody talking about that pass from salah then
Pen yes red no
mmmmmmm
Red card was extremely harsh. There’s no way he intended to keep it out with his hand. Knee’d it onto his hard, was definitely trying to keep it out of the net but within the laws of the game. I generally don’t like Chelsea or James for that matter, but didn’t deserve a red.
Lucky Liverpool at Anfield again. You're gonna pay at the bridge.
As a Chelsea fan, I thought Tuchel was a calamity signing given his history with Dortmond n PSG but the man is fast becoming the best manager in the world 🌎
so what was he supposed to do with the arm if it comes off his thigh? should defenders just tie their arms around their backs?
Rule change is needed. Save the red cards for deliberate goal line saves.
As a man utd fan that was a beautiful header by Chelsea
First of all, never a red, definitely a pen but not a red and it never should've happened in the first place, Alonso headers it out of Mendy's gloves
a red card for that crist thats harsh
Wow I don't care what anyone says, that was NEVER a red card!
Dam it was defo a pen but in first half Chelsea were doing so well looking like we were gunna win but oh well
Mane with the 99 reactions.
Surely this must indicate Chelsea are serious title contenders? Being able to see a game out 1-1 at Anfield with 10 men! Chelsea are solid
Liverpool fan but that Havertz goal was something special, happy with van dijk and matip in general but we clearly didnt deserve the 3 points tonight. Tuchels side keeps impressing more and more as I watch them
New seen a team like Chelsea get so lucky
Get mbappe
Scamfield had the ref in their back pocket and still couldn't beat 10 men 😂 Fair play Chelsea, fair play.
Shocking referee
What a result for the blues bit harsh on the red card I mean it defo hit the arm but a red card his kinda harsh it may be from stopping a goal opportunity be scored even if the hand ball was accidental.
Don't think you can legitimately complain about the red. James brings his hand out to control the ball with his arm. It might be by instinct but it doesn't change the fact that there was intent there also, it stops a certain goal so must be a penalty and a red. There is absolutely no room in the laws of the game for anything other than a red card.
Liverpool were better
great defensive showcase boys
Where are Henderson's and Elliott's efforts that were equally as close to Mount's?!
Penalty yes Red card no
Ref nearly ruined the game, disgusting performance by him, even the second half allowing the WWE tactics from scumpool every time a chelsea player had the ball
Kai Havertz most certainly did not mean it. A fortunate flick on.
If Chelsea didn’t get that red Liverpool would have won
You’re at home, you get a penalty, Chelsea get a red card at the end of the FIRST half and you still don’t win. Smh my head.
“10 man Chelsea hold out against 12 man liverpool”
NO RED BUT STILL A PEN
Trent is sooo sick
Yellow card and a penalty seems more reasonable - the double punishment of penalty and losing a player is just too much.
As a Chelsea fan i can say it was a clear Pen and Red card but the ref should watch the the full scene not just a photo when it comes to VAR. I mean this match finished but what about next time? They'll give him a photo and he will judge from that? I don't like this.
Why is Henderson always looking for a fight?
Good result considering.
despite it ending 1-1, i don’t feel like this was a loss considering how well we defended after reece james getting sent off by some dodgy officiating
As an Arsenal fan, Thomas Tuchel would have been the perfect manager for us. Spent next to nothing, except for Lukaku. Completely changed the team. He's definitely changed as a coach and a manager. PSG made him look average, Dortmund made him look below average. Chelsea makes him look like an absolute elite.
I don't understand people that don't think it was a red card and penalty. His hands aren't in a natural position, they should have been behind his back. Even if it didn't hit his knee it still would have hit his arm. It stopped a clear goal opportunity illegally and the rules say that is a red card? So can people stop being so stupid and just accept it was a good decision and the game needs more of them
Poor with the highlights, there were more exciting plays throughout the game.
James what what 1:30
I’m a Liverpool fan and whilst I don’t like Chelsea that doesn’t mean I can’t respect them when they play well, let’s be honest it wasn’t a red and Chelsea fought hard and deserved a point
Chelsea is very hard to break down because the gaps between the players are very small yet the wing backs are very wide
So biased against Chelsea
Just not a red card yes a pen but not a red
In my opinion it’s not a red it comes off his thigh then on to his hand
Definite penalty and ultimately a red card. If he doesn't swing his arm, the ball goes in off his thigh.
It is confirmed: Anthony Taylor hates Chelsea
1:48 Mendy & Lukaku vs Liverpool lol. Absolute tanks
*“Couldn’t score verse 11 men”* Ye because he blocked it on the line with his hand.
1:48 lol Henderson hesitated to confront the keeper. Waited until his teammates came & held him back
chelsea has that hard mentality. Very tough team this season
12 v 10 and still couldnt nudge a win.. appaling from liverpool
100pc a penalty and 100pc not a red card.. fair play to Chelsea tho, defended very well.
Allison  day dreaming we need new goal keeper
LiVARpool as usual
Bad result for liverpool 2 big points dropped at home.
Lukaku just bodied Henderson and defended mendy
It's Liverpool so obviously all the decisions go to them...
Red card plus penalty is double punishment for one infringement.  Unfair.
Never a red. Always a penalty.
100% in my opinion.. cuz that ball was goal:)
Chelsea Fans: Lukaku Scores against big teams.....
I was neutral today and Chelsea looked the better team by far with 11 men today, defo was a penalty red card was harsh, Liverpool looked average all game even against ten men, Tuchel is an underrated coach IMO, Chelsea have a good squad and look organised and a threat going forward , interesting season ahead !!
Liverpool deserved to win they bossed that game
I’d he didn’t swing his arm it would of been okay but the fact he swung his arm forward is the reason they gave it
He got a red card for a accidentel handball
ARSENAL NO EXCUSES
Unfair on Reese James there. Yes, He handled it, but I doubt it denied a goal, as his body redirected it. I can see where the judgement comes from on it, but it's a bit harsh for both the Pen and Red.  Watching it back, if anything the hand actually pushed the ball back into the danger zone, GIVING a goalscoring opportunity to Liverpool. Also telling that Neither Jota or Mane, the two players best suited to seeing it, seemed to complain.
If MENDY was white.. He would get the credit he overly deserves
Anthony Taylor makes it 4 disgraceful and scandalous decisions against Chelsea, how is this guy still allowed to ref Chelsea???
Do John Abraham and Salman Khan not troll on here anymore. I suddenly just remembered about them 😭
Everton? :D
M.SALAH IS KING Always goal for Liverpool
Note Sky don't show the build up to the Chelsea corner! Taylor gave Liverpool nothing in the whole game. VAR gave the penalty and red card, overruling him. Every 50/50 went to Chelsea, 13 fouls to 4 when Chelsea were defending for most of the game? Disgraceful reffing by the United fan in black.
That referee is a joke that was a yellow at most
Claim your 'here before Sky fixes the title from Everton to Chelsea' card here!
I agree with the pen but. RED??? What???
chelsea definitely title contenders this season
Chelsea are literally a better Burnley but yous ain’t ready for that convo
Azpilicueta's dive at the end was horrendous. No mention on Sky.
Claim your ticket before the title changes to Liverpool vs Chelsea 🎫
If all the Chelsea players play for Everton draw is fair results
Penalty, but no red imo
Penalty and red card.
A draw against a top 4 side is a decent result for either team
So Everton WEREN'T playing in this game then? 😉
People saying it’s not a red which I agree but the rule is if you stop a goal scoring opportunity no matter what it should be a red
Just a pen, not a red
i have a couple of things to say about the game. Starting wit the Chelsea goal it was good but when it got to Reece James i think VAR is unfair he didnt desire the red card in my opinon. the penalty was fair. And i dont think Mendy and Rudiger should have got a yellow card they was trying to justify why Reece shouldnt have been sent off. But overall good game keep it up yu blues
Liverpool - Everton? Lol
Who's here when the title still says ''Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton'' haha
liverpool vs everton nice Merseyside derby
Winning in anfield isn’t easy, let alone drawing with 10 men! BIG UPS TO THE BLUES 🔵🔵 COYB
Chelsea fans are very happy for taking 1 point and that shows the importance of Liverpool
Great result for Everton tbf they played two games in one day
All these TV pundit's where tipping Chelsea forgetting just how good Liverpool are!
titles wrong sky!
How does mount wriggle his way into any team?
Lol it’s not everton
It would be really good to see a big rivalry between these two go on through out the season especially as both will be title contenders
What a header!
Everton fans are like, ok, we take the point at Enfield ..we don't mind🤔 even tho we didn't play them yet🤣
It's a penalty and deserved the red, also Mendy should have been given a red for trying to kick the ball when Henderson had it near his face to celebrate
Today underlined why Liverpool won't win the title
At least Chelsea scored a righteous goal!
Southampton taking notes on how to defend with a man down 😂
Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton 🤣
Best league in the world? Yeah oil and sky money, ffs
Chelsea would have won EASY with 11 men and not a Liverpool fan as a REF! Absolute joke man!
Liverpool didn't deserve that point
everton yh 🤔
I find it funny no matter how many chances one team has, if they don’t score them then the opposition played great defensively. If Liverpool would have scored one more from their 23 shots no one would be going crazy about Chelsea’s defence, if their defensive was so great, where did they leak so many chances?
Well then... probably changed by the time u see this but according to the title this game was Liverpool vs Everton 😂
Chelsea win 1-1
Surprised they didn't show the fouls from the first 15 minutes
whys it say liverpool 1-1 everton
this will be the story whole season for liverpool fc for not buying any additional players
corr if Alisson saved that goal jeeez
Good to see Anthony Taylor not even watching the replay and looking at the still image 🙂
I noticed something that nobody would think off look at title it says liverpool vs everton
Liverpool VERY lucky!!!!
VIVA RONALDO
Good result for Everton 👍
It says Liverpool vs Everton not Liverpool vs chrlsea
Everton in title lol haha 😂
Liverpool 1 everton 1 hellooooo
Never a red.
Liverpool fan here but Chelsea were amazing in the first half. Never thought Havertz' goal was gonna go in, well done blues a well deserved point, but should have been three.
penalty merchant
Anthony Taylor man of the match
Mendy is gonna become a world class keeper under Tuchel
Salah only scores penalties and tap ins
You put Everton not chelsea
Was never a red card we got robbed
Everton?
Here before the title is changed from 'Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton' to 'Liverpool 1 - 1 Chelsea.'
It was a clear pen, he moves his arm across his body to move the ball away, the first touch was fine but the second was awful - good call
Everton?
0:34 we have a little Gary Neville "Ooo" ladies and gents.
48 million in each of Matpis and Van Dijks pockets
I wish arsenal were like this
Did anyone else see Henderson get in a fight with mendy after the penalty when mendy kicked his leg instead of the ball😂
Liverpool fan here but credit to Chelsea, look a proper team under Tuchel.
Liverpool need a finisher been saying it all along! Should have got three points today!
Why does it say Liverpool 1  Everton 1?!
Bruh Everton is never gonna draw at Anfield lmaoooo
Main takeaway is this Liverpool team will not beat this Chelsea team 11 v 11.
Who's here when it says Liverpool 1 Everton 1
Van dijk in his pockets: Lukaku, havertz, Mason
Chelsea has the best team with 10 men they handle extremely well Liverpool. It reminds me the Inter Milan Jose developed. The squad played 3 games with 10 men during the season they won the champions league.
Wasn't great defending it was standard good defending against a very mediocre one dimensional attack. Liverpool only have to ways of playing, press and counter with pace which wasn't happening against a back 5 sitting in with 10 men or have your fullback stick cross after cross into the back post. Chelsea defenders could have defending for another hour without breaking sweat. Klopp has no new ideas.
unlucky james had no controlon that handball decision liverpool would have lost
The title
Hang on sky sports football team crew and you just put Chelsea wrong today against Liverpool not Everton go and fix it please?
liverpool everton😂
Should of been a red but a pen yes
After this city will definitely win the league
Chelsea playing with 10 defenders most of the game 🙄.
Chelsea would have won this game. It was the best team. The referee was rubbish: penalty and red card.
Everton
Everton?
Liverpool should’ve won after playing against 10 men second half. So many chances and shots on goal...chance to win missed really, but still near the top on 7 points like Chelsea. Everton looking good with Rafa back in charge again in Liverpool.
why are people saying that's not a red card?
ye man 'Liverpool 1-1 Everton'
listen to all the idiots saying Liverpool couldnt beat 10 men or Chelsea were too good. They defend will all players in the box. they played for a draw.
Anthony Taylor literally looked at a still image for "VAR"
Last week Newcastle centre half handled v villa. Would have been a goal.Ref gave penalty....but no sending off ? Inconsistent...
Salah and Matip clearly dissenting, kicking the ball away and swearing at the ref- No yellow.  The ref sees a still shot of the ball touching Reece James' hand and he's all -RED CARD RED CARD RED CARD!!!!
Not having the fans and the injuries was  the issue last season they said... Yet again Liverpool flop at home against 10 men only to score a penalty... Well done Chelsea
Is it me or does it say liverpool 1 - 1 Everton ?
Tell this isn't the BEST league in Football
Pen and red card. He's stopping a clear obvious goal
Liverpool v everton? Someone is getting fired 😂
That Everton side play just like Chelsea
Ah yes EVERTON
Am I tripping or does it say Liverpool vs Everton instead of Chelsea
Not a red
still says Liverpool 1-1 Everton. Sky Sports have done another madness tonight
Elliot was outstanding  and Joel Matip lasted the whole game for once hopefully  Bobby  is okay and  93rd minute corner where’s Allison  when you need him lol A bit harsh on James the red card or a penalty not both at close range you have no time to move out the way sometimes the ref gives the benefit of the doubt but still Liverpool should’ve close the game out against 10 men Let’s hope all the Liverpool players get back from international duty in one piece we’ve got a title to get back
Great result for Everton
how did chelsea hold on
Chelsea really is the team to beat this season for sure after watching this game!!
Everton changed their whole squad 😳
Liverpool 14 fouls amd 0 yellow cards
Good game to Liverpool, from a Chelsea fan.
Liverpool - Everton lol
If you get the ball blasted at you what you met to do jump out the way???
Seeing YouTube comments on this game is so much better than Twitter.
Liverpool was awful today. Chelsea was better even with a man down.
Liverpool vs everton was a very good match 👍
How to ruin a great football match by Anthony Taylor
2:09 😂
Sky Sports 😂😂 if it was United, it would read “United fail to take advantage of Chelsea being a man down”
why does the title say liverpool 1 - 1 everton
is it me or does it say liverpool vs everton???
It’s not a red card it’s certainly a penalty. I think it’s harsh on Chelsea.
Ohh Anthony tailer hese done it again
Lol liVARpool had help and still couldn’t score against 10 men
the bias shown by the refs and pundits in this game was ridiculous. If it wasnt for the deadset red card and penalty we would be looking at that more. 3 minutes of stoppage time just summed up the officiating
Liverpool deserves to win it was clearly a red and a penalty so why are people complaining also Chelsea are so dirty lukaku is a fraud scores against arsenal and when he comes up against a good team he is invisible also the debate is over Taa over Reece James any day
They said Everton instead of chelsea
Everton?
Never a red, Chelsea should get that reviewed.
forgot everton played 2 games in 1 day
Why are the referees in this league so crap man 😂😭
Liverpool need to drop deeper and invite teams onto them from time to time. When Liverpool are up high and have the opposition penned in then there's no space
Why is it named liverpool vs Everton
Liverpool 1-1 Everton😂
Liverpool vs Everton?
Everton?
Well earned point against Everton today lads 👏🤣
I don’t get how it’s so hard for everyone. His hand stopped the ball going in the goal which can only be a red and a penalty
Same old chelsea 1 up then park the 'bus'
Funny seeing the amount of Chelsea fans happy for a draw vs Liverpool, wait until you play City
Ngl I was so upset when Reece James was sent off! Chelsea didn’t deserve it and where working very hard for the win! But that’s football - but I’m glad we showed resilience to keep the points! Up the Chels 💙💙💙
I remember when Chelski fans said De Gea carries Man Utd, how the tables have turned
Sky Sports can you change the title to Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea
You've probably got to give that as a penalty but that's not a red all day long for me.
No red card no penalty. Comes off his leg then arm.
Great penalty
the title of this video got me so confused
That bald egg of a referee better never be on my television screen ever again
The bin-dippers should have bought Ronaldo!
Hmmm yes Everton football club
No wonder we didn't win playing against Chelsea and Everton in the same match
Nice Gary Neville ‘ooh’ in there
Pen defo, red I don’t think so imo
The title literally says Everton...
I hate salah with a passion so overrated
It's going to be very tight this season, I'm a Chelsea fan, but I'm afraid I think City will still just nick it.
Sky sports admin having a shocker mistaking chelsea for everton
The officiating wasn’t great but the penalty decision and red card was correct. If you’ve got a problem with that, read the rule book and get back to me
Penalty? Yes Red card? Hell no  He clearly tried to stop it with his thigh and went on to hit his arm. You gotta give him a yellow for something like that because there’s no way he can react fast enough to know it’s going in off his thigh, which he tried to stop the ball with first.   Regardless, I’m shocked by Chelsea going to Anfield and dominating when they had 11 men. After watching this game, I think they’ll win the league.
If there is consistency then I don't have a problem with it and I'm a Chelsea fan. If this ref doesn't send off another player for a similar offence then there should be calls for him to be sacked. I would suggest that he has set the bar for himself and others by this decision and if they don't consistently send players off under the same circumstances then the clubs need to take action against the refs. I would suggest if it was a Liverpool player it might not have been a penalty and if his hands were tied by the rules then how come Salah didn't get a card for dissent when he kicked the ball away? You can't have it always. You either implement the rules to the full or you don't if you don't then you will be seen to be biased.
Chelsea fan but have u guys seen that mount is a bit greedy like the guy has not squared again and again last game as well and recently the front three apart from Lukaku was greedy I hope Werner can play we could have used him
It says everton
Am I the only one who sees Everton in the title?
LiVARpool couldn't beat 10 men Chelsea LOLOLOL
So no one gonna speak about mendy performance
referee single handedly decided the game..robbed chelsea of 3 points...penalty yess. but not red card.. luis suraez hand ball is a red card...  reece wasnt even trying to stop the ball with hand.. he had leg raised up.. but the ball went to hand..
chelski got lucky
Everton? Chelsea isn't it? 🤔
Chelsea defended really well with 10 men, I kinda wish they didn't get a red card so we could have more space up front for counter attacks.
Everton looking like a great team
Anthony Taylor frequents youth swimming pools and he doesn't have any kids
Penalty yes. Red card No!!
Everton coming in hot with the best transfers this window 😂
This is the difference between a world class manager and the likes of Arteta!
referee saved liverpool from a 3-0 smashing.
Chelsea quadruple this season.
Hard game for both teams. As a Liverpool fan I would have preferred James stayed on, I think as a competition that red card killed the game an Chelsea did brilliant to hang on, these two teams will be right at the top at the end.
Everton's Badge be looking different these days
Shouldn’t be a red
"Liverpool 1-1 Everton" ?????
Reece James is unfortunate as it deflects off his knee onto his arm, but once he scooped the ball away it’s a red, all day! 🛑
The game was so compelling before the red, a real shame. This season is looking insanely competitive. Has the potential to be the best title race ever imo.
Shoulda been a yellow and a pen not a red
Red a bit harsh imo
Everton did well to get the point away 😂😂😂
Read card correct .. Penalty correct .. Goal keeper should get yellow  card for not the right behaviour after penalty
The title Is wrong it says liv v eve 1-1
VAR helping Liverpool and it's only the 3rd game in to the new season.
Red cards harsh there you're not denying a goalscoring chance if they get a penalty and it wasnt a Suarez punch over the bar, penalty was enough.
And a red card for the person that wrote Everton instead of Chelsea in the title!
Pen all day long, yellow card for me though but even mendy was lucky also after the penalty was scored.
Camera save that was from reece james
Erm Sky? Liverpool vs Everton?  Am i in the future🤔
neutral; it wasnt a pen. Liverpool got lucky
I got a reece james ad right before this😭😂
Respect to Lukaku rushing in to help back Mendy As a Utd fan that was never a red card it wasn't intentional by the look of it
I think it may be a penalty but never a red
Harsh sending off , but It is what it is . One point a piece Liverpool can thank Taylor Chelsea can thank their defence .
The Rule from the IFAB states: "A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off: • denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)." So following the letter of the law, he has no choice but to send him off.
Has anyone noticed it says Liverpool vs Everton in the title?  How do you make that big of a mistake?
Handball and red. Right decision.  Liverpool front 3 aging and clueless. No investment. What a shame that no backing by board to a talented manager.  Rivals will push on. Some great work by rivals. Chelsea are good
It’s not Everton it’s Chelsea
That's not even handball bc theres a new handball rule so if it hits the arm it's not handball but if it hits the shoulder it's handball... Idk why though
Why the heck are sky putting everton in the title                 Sky's had a stinker             Read More
Lukaku was rubbish this game overrated 😴
Great game today against Everton..
Everton must have teleported to Anfield if they got there so quickly from Brighton
I was at the game
Chelsea vs Everton has been the title for nearly an hour
You mean Chelsea
Didn't realise Reece James played for Everton, or any Chelsea player for that matter.
Everton 🤣
This red card and second half performance could actually really benefit Chelsea at this stage of the season. The spirit, resolve, determination and belief shown, and gained, from that ''old-school Chelsea'' performance demonstrated that this squad are very much in the title race, and have the abilities and mentalities to be a dominant force over the next four or five years, at least..
Ref Ruined a perfectly good game.
That reefery he must be scheme of himself it's the worst
2:00 That ball from Salah 🥵🔥 What an absolute beauty!
A good oooh from Neville today
Haha "Chelsea hold on despite James red for handball on the line! | Liverpool 1-1 Everton | EPL Highlights"
Chelsea will win the league.end of
LIVERPOOL - EVERTON? Sky Sports what you on?
Chelsea was immense despite one man down fair play to them! ✊🏽 from Arsenal fan
Hey you made a mistake on the title it should be Chelsea 👍
It really baffles me how the media and pundits say teams play well when all they do is just sit back with everyone behind the ball bar the striker. That ain’t playing well that’s called parking the bus.
The red card ruined the game. It literally ended at half time. Liverpool weren't quick enough on the counter attack, and when Chelsea had their chances in the first half to make those key passes we flopped. If u wanna see the match, just watch the first half. Eduoard Mendy was a machine in goal, no doubt.  Chelsea's defence took center stage this game. We worked as a team to stop Liverpool and that's what we need to win trophies. Overall I'll give the rating for both teams a 7/10: Chelsea for the defence, Liverpool for the attack. But yeah, average 2nd half when it comes to entertainment. Liverpool not good enough in attack, Chelsea brilliant in defence.
Great second half defensive performance by Chelsea
Nice title sky sports also where is derby forest?
Chelsea not gonna lose many this season an absolute nightmare to play against
Why does it say Everton 1-1 Liverpool in tittle
That first half was a fantastic watch: a fast tempo, top class encounter with two of the world's best sides going at each other. I know rules are rules and the ref probably did have to send James off. However, it completely ruined the game as a spectacle. Shame.
That Chelsea keeper is something special ain't he.
Can I have another bottle of Liverpool tears please
Why does it say 1-1 vs Everton
Definitely a pen and in the rules Definitely a red. Like Gary says he swings through with his arm
the when salah scored henderson the prat doesn't need to get the ball so im happy mendy kicked him
I think it was a pen and red, but honestly before the incident Chelsea looked the far better side. There were at least two or three moments where if chelsea picked a better final ball to play on lukaku or mount, they would have been through. All the fans claiming liverpool found it harder against 10 men are sort of correct, but are forgetting g how dangerous Chelsea were for a good 20 mins before the pen.
A fine Everton performance.
I’m so disappointed in football now a days it’s about playing 5 at the back with holding dms that’s what wins trophies it’s so boring to watch
Proud of the lads. Really disappointing because we could’ve killed the game before the sending off and I’m confident we would’ve won were the penalty not awardedZ
Chelsea hold on , Liverpool 1 Everton 1 ? What
I thought they changed the rule so it wasn’t a double penalty to the team for decisions like that. I just don’t think the red card was necessary and I hope the FA reduce the ban asap.
liVARpool
Nice title sky
Chelsea vs.... Everton ???
yeah its a point.
why does it say liverpool 1-1 everton
Watching Liverpool play at the moment is becoming tough. 11 men lumped behind the ball. We need to buy a strong centre forward who we can just play a long ball into if the game looks like its turning that way
A draw with 10 men for 50 minutes against Liverpool at Anfield. Tuchel is a genius.
All credit to Chelsea , , their manager has transformed his team into a world class outfit , Liverpool have stood still since they won the league , they will struggle again this season , cannot se them in the top four , you have to beat 10 men ., basically lack of quality  vs quality .
Definitely not a red card.
Mendy should’ve been sent off for kicking the ball out of Henderson’s hands.
Didn't know Everton were playing?
Havertz goal was amazing but the ref had to ruin the game
man said everton
Definite handball and definite red card
liverpool = bad club, 10 men and a pen, still coundn't get the job done.
0:11 thanks. Now i know where he lives
Not a red card
A fair result and Chelsea defended well in the second half. Worryingly Liverpool couldn’t break down a massed back line, a problem overspilling from the last campaign and one that will reoccur many times throughout the season. Liverpool’s front three misfired today, as they can on occasions and just as in the last campaign, a Plan B is sorely lacking.
we were the better team just couldn’t finish our chances. need to sign a clinical striker
on the title it says liverpool 1-1 Everton when it meant to be chealsea
Chelsea not Everton fellas
Am i the only one seeing Everton in the title instead of chelsea 😂😂
Cluless Klopp does it again. Chelsea was there for the taking but nooooo genius game change from Klopp. This man will never be able to go toe toe with other mangers and come up on top. Built a great squad but clueless on how to use it.
Everton?
Lukaku is still the stiff goal hanger from united days. Not worth the price
Ummmmmm  Everton?
Liverpool v Everton??
Why did u say Liverpool can Everton when it was Liverpool vs Chelsea??
A red was really harsh but definitely a penalty Chelsea would take that as a mini W Liverpool will feel like they could’ve gotten more credit. Havertz he’s incredible & S/O to Harvey for an 18 year old his game is so polished I see why Klopp trusts him.
Everton lookin different today
Mané was gonna give Reece James a hug. Be like Mané people.
is it me or does it say: "Liverpool vs Everton"?
Fantastic from chelsea,  really silenced the Liverpool fans with that defending
Well his arm is stationary when it deflects and he only moves it after the ball has left his arm. But Taylor won't bother looking for that will he, spent 1 second at that screen and walked off. Not a pen, or a red. Classic Taylor on Chelsea.
Lukaku in Van Dijks pocket
If you have ambitions of winning the league you really have to beat a TEN men Chelsea side, Chelsea looked the far better side in the first half , but if you don't sign anyone what do you expect.
Any reason why I have just seen Chelsea team walking home???? Oh yeah they left the bus in the area
Fair play to Chelsea was a ridiculously good performance to take a draw. VVD proved in the first half why he's the best CB in the world. Lukaku didnt managed to do anything
Yes Liverpool vs Everton well done sky
Change the name to Chelsea
Fair play to the Chelsea defenders for hanging on with 10 men
We all new it will be a draw it’s both German managers who both managed Bvb and both won the ucl in the prem and also have the same points
Penalty all day.
Liverpool are not title contenders. They’re top 4 contenders.   45 minutes a man up, playing at home, infront of their own fans… and yet couldn’t beat the opposition. Chelsea or not, that’s utterly disgraceful. It really is quite embarrassing. (Not forgetting they required a penalty to even score in the first place).
VVd empties his pockets at home  Keys Wallet Mount
On another note, these highlights are way too short
Not hard to defend when you've completely parked the bus
Only real positive is that vvd and matip were brilliant against lukaku
I think if james doesnt move his arm there its not a deliberate. It actually hits his arm while in a natural position and if he leaves it he gets away with it. The fact he swings his arm after it hits him is just stupid.
Non of this would of happened if Alonso didn't head the ball of mendy's hand
Fouls LiVARpool: 13  Chelsea: 4
Title at the moment: Liverpool 1-1 Everton
Lucky Chelsea flick on that was meant for Lukaku, that flukily went in.
Literally reminded me of 2014, Chelsea just defending the whole game, not even trying to win it
Is it late to become a pro footballer at 28 or 29 years old if you have the talent and style ?
Is it late to become a pro footballer at 28 or 29 years old if you have the talent and style ?
Well Done to Everton for picking up a record 4 points today :)
thought they played Chelsea not Everton
Liverpool will celebrate that draw. Enough said.
Liverpool vs Everton, what a game!
Anyone gonna point out the fact it says Liverpool v Everton lol?
Worst ref in the premier league award goes too Anthony Taylor 👏 but iam proud of our defending in that 2nd half stopping Liverpool 👏
Liverpool v Everton lolllll
Still trying to figure out what thiago brings to this team ? He may well be one of the most overrated players in recent times !
Both teams look robotic no clear parhway to win imo ... United to have the title race wirh city imo
I swear Lukaku plays for chelsea and not everton???????????
Imo that was never a red card
That wasn't a red card the ref had a quick glance at the screen and made his mind up, clearly I've he looked he would see it was a penalty but not in a million years that was a red ruined the game
liverpool are genuinely a bang average team now, washed up losers. no way they're gonna challenge for the prem or ucl
The title says Everton not Chelsea
Everton played Brighton u meltatrons
Everton? sky had a stinker
still have time to change the title
Chelsea were only playing with 9 men if you include Lukaku. Modern day Heskey.
i feel bad for james honestly as he didnt mean too
Can’t believe Liverpool couldn’t beat 10 man chelsea when they had 12 men
1 point that will prove crucial. Well deserved Chelsea!
Sky fix up the title
Great defending from Everton, and a great headed goal from Tim Cahill
Why Chelsea want to spend money on kunde, this defence is strong
As a liverpool fan im very dissapointed, I thought Elliot should have been brought off early in the second half, but chelsea played well, mane and salah kept losing the ball in tight positions, lack of creativity
Resilient performance from Chelsea, superb game management, Christensen again superb but as usual Anthony Taylor keeps making games hard for us COYB💙
Didn't know chelsea were everton
100% a red card for me. He purposefully pushed the ball away from the goal. Just watch the movement of his right arm at 1:09.
Just waiting for the world to pull their tongue out of tuchels rusty sheriffs badge. Any team with ten men away from home would defend like they do. Arsenal are not in the convo because they are just lost completely.
Is this how Everton win the league? Sky Sports renames Chelsea?
Liverpool vs Everton 🤣
1:49 everyone's gangsta until Lukaku arrives
Mendy was class  btw, from a red
Great performance by Chelsea! Looked like a championship winning team.
Anthony really looked at the monitor for 1 second and decided it was a pen and a red. These refs need investigating😭
Mendy was superb for Chelsea!!
Shouldahad chillwell instead of Alonso
also Liverpool vs Everton..... Anyone else gonna point this out
Please just sack Anthony Tayler.. Just sack him already. Hes a terrible ref, the worst in the league terrible he is
Personally I don’t think it’s enough for a red card. Humans have arms, the ball bounced of his arm and he couldn’t do anything about it.
Change Tuchels photo and fade it to Jose playing “but if you close your eyes”  Trust me you’ll get it
Anyone else sick of seeing teams play 7 at the back and counter attack for 90 minutes?
Give a pen and a yellow, the game is still great to watch. But no red card games now boring. Prem is the biggest league in the world with the worst refs
Liverpool players have no vision , they just play pointless long passes and crosses .
All that money spent sucking a draw from the best team in the world, Virgil says sorry for keeping lukaku in his pocket YNWA.. we were lucky I’m not daft
Anthony Taylor needs the sack even Liverpool fans and players said it shouldn't have been a Red Card at most maybe a penalty.
Same thing happened to James in the cl final and got no penalisation but for a natural body movement is not a red card
What a performance by the lads🔵🔵🔵🔵
Everton??
You wrote everton and not chelsea
Great defending from Everton in this match.
Liverpool 1 1 Everton?
U put the title wrong Liverpool weren’t against Everton
I knew Chelsea would get a jammy goal from a corner because that’s the only way they can score against LFC
Says Liverpool vs Everton for me anyone else?
Wrong Team Sky Sports Well Done Lads
Chelsea not Everton mistake in the title!
The wheels on the bus go round and round... except on the Chelsea bus because its parked on the anfield pitch
Liverpool 1 Everton 1 yeah ok sky sports
Liverpool: Mentality Minnows.
the conversation Anthony Taylor had with the var ref, "just look at the screen for 2 seconds on the part where it just shows an image of it hitting his arm so we can sell it"
Was a pen, shouldn't've been red, ruined the game imo. Chelsea did a very good job holding on but Liverpool never looked impressive at all
You made a mistake instead of Chelsea you put Everton
Isnt it Chelsea not Everton
We defended well in second half with 10 men
It says that Liverpool played Everton on the title but they played Chelsea instead
everton?
Drew against 12 men, some performance! Penalty? Yeah defo but never a sending off, Taylor took his chance to influence the game but didn't quite come off. We would've comfortably beay Liverpool without official's interference but I'm more confident that ever that we can challenge for title
How are refs still out here getting it wrong 😂 they literally have slow motion to help them get it right lol.
Liverpool vs Everton????
Not the result we wanted, but a fair results at the end of the day. The great wall of Mendy was solid, Christensen was a beast, T Silva and Rudi held it down. At times I am convinced Alonso is not a real player, but he was solid in the second half after his first half incident. Oh and Anthony taylor is incredibly bald.
Who else saw Everton instead of Chelsea in the title
Can someone tell me why it was a red
Liverpool vs Everton?  Who’s here before the title isn’t changed?
didn´t know everton signed lukaku, infact looks a completely different team 😂
Mendy acts as if he's going to get stabbed by Tuchel in his sleep when he concedes a goal
Who’s here when the title says Liverpool v Evertoon
Harsh red card . He didn't mean to use his hand . It was just reflex.  Penalty decision was correct though
Definite penalty, he stopped a certain goal with his arm albeit accidentally. Red card was harsh though. When you have the benefit of VAR, refs shouldn't make rash decisions like that.
Penaltly, fair enough. But red? I don't think so.
Chelsea fans you were so lucky not have conceded more than 1. Are finishing just needs improving…
1:28 even Mane couldn't believe it was a red, shocking decision
If chelsea had 11 men they would have won easily
Everton Liverpool everton
Imagine naming Chelsea Everton.
Definitely a pen and definitely a red... Not trolling but the arm blocked a certain goal
"Why Chelsea play so good"
Might wanna change the title
The ref is absolutely shocking! If you watched the match you would see he didn’t even watch the VAR he just walked over and looked at the pic and went back. He didn’t even watch the video  12vs10 and this muppets still couldn’t score
Ok, but why does it say in the title Liverpool-Everton ?:))
Someone needs to fix the title
when did liverpool play everton (title)
Why does the title say Liverpool vs Everton? Wake up Sky!
everton did exceptional to not concede
Deffo pen not sure if it was worth a red though..
We are the best team in the world.
Chelsea would have beaten them without the red. Simple, we set the tone of the game by defending and countering, lukakus hold you game gave haverts and mount space in behind. That 2nd half chance were lukaku held it up for kova would’ve been finished by havertz. And Liverpool would have lost all their confidence.
the new pelah
Anyone else notice it says Liverpool 1-1 Everton?
Arsenal with 10 men: lose 3-0 (5-0) Chelsea with 10 men: lose 1-0 (1-1)  London is still blue💙💙💙 (I'm not a Chelsea fan)
Where’s the Jorginho and Havertz haters? 🤫
This uncle ruckus guy in the comments is kinda sad😂
the titles wrong
No one going to talk about the title. Everton 1-1 Liverpool 🤣
cant believe rafa benitez is able to create a draw against Liverpool :/
Is no one going to point out the title saying Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton? ahaha
Oh u didn't know it was Liverpool Vs Everton
Who is watching while it still says everton? lol
LiVARpool 😂😂still couldn’t score when we had 10 men, only scored with a pen. Never ever was a red it was a clear accident. Penalty yes Red card no
Everton?
Ref was shocking and alonso shouldn't have played really why you play him against salah he's too slow n he ruined it for mendy that led to messy  second half
This shows that we can win the league
United, Chelsea and City are the only title contenders this season.
There’s no battle between VVD n Lukaku Van Dijk had him silenced
It was definitely a red card. Obviously it's harsh, but if its a penalty then it has to be a red by the laws of the game.
title of the vid says everton???
Liverpool are not title contenders. They have the worst bench among the top 4 and can’t even beat a 10 man team.
What did lukaku do this game?
Anyone noticed it says liverpool vs everton instead of chelsea
Chelsea deserved the win
Everton??
Is it me or does it say LIVERPOOL VS EVERTON
Anthony Taylor has something against Chelsea. He isn’t even trying to hide it….
Hey sky sports, you got the title of the video wrong
Does it say Liverpool 1 1 Everton for anyone else?😂
SkySports youtube smashing it again with these upload times. Liverpool 1-1 Evert... wait... wait a second?
Liverpool 1 Everton 1 hahahahahaha nice title
Incredible performance by chelsea! 10 warriors was enough to stop LiVARpool
Unbelievable
There is no way that’s a red card
I could of wrote this before the game if we could see chelsea were to have a man sent off.  “Tuchel masterclass bla bla defensive unit”. Get an asbolute grip. 10 men behind the ball is not a defensive masterclass. Its what any team in the world would do. ANY TEAM. Happy with the reds performance cant wait for the rematch at stamford bridge when these stoke imitators have to actually come out an play 💪🏻👊🏻🤙🏻
Mendy was motm, Liverpool should of won by three or four
They put Everton instead of Chelsea in title lmao
Why has this ref still got a job?
Credit where due. Master class of defending from Chelsea.  But as a Liverpool fan - FFS sell Mane and Firmino, while they still got value. Mane looks Shot.
please remove everton
Ummm.... "Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton"... Okay Sky Sports...
Klopp literally treats Keita like a dog, Keita was superb in midfield in the first 2 games and Klopp just drops him instantly, we could have used his experience in the second half to break down their defence
It was a red card, it denied a clear and obvious Goal. It’s like when you tackle someone from behind when he’s clear on goal, it’s a red card no matter how unfair if it denies a clear goal scoring opportunity.
Once again from Anthony Taylor, I should have known, shame on me
Anyone else notice Everton in the title 😂
ngl but this season liverpool have a chance to win silverware keep it up liverpool
Here before Sky change the title
Ah yes, Liverpool vs Everton Lukaku making his debut for Everton
Arsenal take note, that’s how you play with ten men.
Robbed
He needs to stop refereeing Chelsea games. Maybe a penalty but NEVER a red.
Some gonna get sacked for wrong title... Liverpool 1-1 Everton😂
All these chelski tears are so yummy 😋😋
Mendy is different gravy
does anyone realise that they wrote everton instead of chelsea in the title of the vid
Hey guys imagine having a good club (I am an arsenal fan)
Is it a penalty? Yes because if it doesn’t hit his arm, it’s going in.   But there’s no way that’s a red card! If you tackle a player in the box it’s a yellow and a penalty, so why’s it not the same here?   And this is from a Liverpool fan! Fair play to Chelsea, defensive masterclass 👏🏻
Why does the title of the video say liverpool and Everton
liverpool vs everton?
Mendy was really triggered when he conceded
Am I the only one who thinks Alonso played absolutely shambolic at times this game?
Clear Red and Pen. Pen for handling the ball. Yes, it hit his thigh and then went on his arm, but he pushed the ball away. Red for denial of a clear goal goal scoring opportunity.
Im an Arsenal fan and I think it was a pen but not a red
Brilliant game of football
WHY IS THE TITLE LIVERPOOL 1-1 EVERTON😭😭
Any side when parking the bus: BOO THIS IS WHY UR RUINING THE GAME Chelsea when they park the bus: WHAT A DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE FROM CHELSEA MENDY IS A GOAT TUCHEL IS THE NEXT RIENCARNATION OF FERGUSON EXCEPT 10 TIMES BETTER
Virgil pocketing lukaku ….levels to the big Dutchman
Every single playing leaving blood sweat and tears on the pitch. Love to see the passion for the shirt which seemed to have been lost a few years ago. Big up Chels
Lol the title says Liverpool vs Everton right now
Chelsea hold on despite James red for handball on the line! | Liverpool 1-1 EVERTON | EPL Highlights
Chelsea were robbed.
Anyone else laughing it says Everton 1 - 1 Liverpool
Who is here when it says Liverpool 1- 1 Everton
This match just showed that if Chelsea had 11 Men, they easily win this.
Here before they fixed the title.. well done EVERTON
in my opinion Liverpool we’re way more dominant as a team but jesus this was filled with drama
Mendy is an absolute tank
Has no one noticed it says Everton in the title? 🤦‍♂️
What nonsense to not offer Chelsea’s highlights from 2nd half. Had the better chances. Saw nothing from Liverpool in that last 45. Nothing to trouble the rest of the league. ‘Wrestling’ is on later this evening.
Everton ????
I never knew the Chelsea squad switched to Everton   Look at title of vid
In before they change the title to Chelsea! 😅
defo liverpool v everton
Timewasting from the minute they went ahead fouls all over the pitch. A fluke of a header that was meant for a flick on. The reds were worthy winners just lackin abit of clinical finishing. Was always going to be hard when they went down to 10 men as it was operation stoke. Anthony taylor should never ref another game against liverpool again hes from manchester FFS whats going on? Never mind Van Dijk lukaku isnt worthy hes still in Matips back pocket. As for azpilicueta. How do you go home and look at your wife an kids after rolling around like that 😂shameful.  Up the mighty reds. Soon as we get up to scratch its on let me tell ye. ❤️🔴👊🏻
Now we know where Liverpool's transfer budget went....the refs pocket
Why is it liverpool vs everton in the title?
hmm yes liverpool 1 - 1 everton
Liverpool vs Everton nice one sky sports 😁
Why does it say Liverpool 1-1 Everton 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
anthony taylor should get sacked i dont know what he's seeing
So noone notices it says liverpool 1-1 everton ?!!!!!
Liverpool 1 - 1 Everton LMAOOO
That's never a straight red but gg liverpool
the second half defending dam
I do agree with the penalty but a red card? Never (Chelsea fan)
Clueless 2nd half from Liverpool, had no clue how to break them down. Brilliant defensive display from Chelsea. Was definately a pen btw but the red card was a joke
Chelsea well deserved a win today, unlucky red card
Came in at 8 mins
Tuchel masterclass once again
Sky Sports Correct the title. Liverpool vs Chelsea. Not Liverpool vs Everton.
Chelsea got robbed
what a performance from everton to deny liverpool a second
Fabinho : Fouls our players 10 times even after a warning Salah : Kicks the ball away out of frustration  Anthony taylor : I'mma pretend i didn't see any of that
thats silly i think man, james' arm wasnt even in an unnatural position his hand was below his waist...
On a day where all Man City fans sat down eating popcorn and scrolled through the comments
lmao wrong team
That red was so harsh imo
Edouuuuuuuuuuu
Penalty and red card? Just a penalty? Or nothing? Let us know what YOU think! 👇
Its a penalty, but theres no way thats a red card, it hit his leg first.
why does the title liverpool 1-1 Everton and not chealsea
Personally I think if Chelsea had 11 men, they would’ve won
Who’s here when the title still says ‘Liverpool 1-1 Everton’ ?
Liverpool 1-1 Everton Lol
As a chelsea fan, this is lost.
Not just Chelsea, Anthony Taylor constantly makes rash decisions. The Premier League is the best and richest league ion the world and we notoriously have the worst officiating.
Everton looking alot better this season :)
ahahaha they got the title wrong
Mendy is the best keeper in the prem
Come on Chelsea great performance. We hanged on against a good team which shows what great spirit Tuchel has created in this Chelsea squad. Great result. Come on Blues🔵🔵
as harsh as it is, thats a red card
Didn't realise it was the Derby today 😭
Arsenal take note. This is how a top team plays when down to 10 men.
not a red
Fair play to Chelsea, from a Liverpool fan. That defensive formation/system, tuchel has created, is unbelievable.
Perfect result for utd 👹
here before they correct the title (says everton instead of chelsea)
Jose would be proud of that bus they parked
Liverpool 1-1 Everton Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea*
liverpool 1 everton 1
Has anyone noticed the title "Chelsea hold on despite James red for handball on the line! | Liverpool 1-1 Everton | EPL Highlights" it says Everton I think its Chelsea not Everton
You know it’s a penalty when Neville says it is
I’m here when it says Everton instead of Chelsea
It’s always Anthony “egg” Taylor
Please can someone explain to me how handballing on the line isn’t a red but tbf this game proves we need a signing
Did anyone notice the title - Liverpool vs Everton?
Everton?
It says Everton in the thumbnail 😂😂
Impressive point for Chelsea, I know it's early days for them, but they might push us all the way this season..COYS
liverpool v everton? that title is bugged
Liverpool vs Everton????
Top 3 in the epl got the same points and same goal difference
Everton really put it up to Liverpool today
Arteta needs to sit and watch how to handle one man getting a red. Honestly. THIS is how you play!!
Great goal from havertz
Chelsea much better than liverpool..much better
Mendy gave Henderson a bloody karate kick that.
Chelsea 10 man are better then the whole Arsenal Squad
Matip & VVD pocketed ur £100M reject
LiVARpool at it again.
Here before title is changed
Everton?
I swear the Referee gave everything against Chelsea They did Well to get a point with 10 men considering  the Referee was that bad
Liverpool couldn’t beat a 10 man Chelsea😭 Chelsea are so clear
What a header
The title wtf sky its chelsea not everton
Ok that was a penalty but a red card? For that? It collided of his thigh and then he moved his arm afterwards that’s very harsh to be sent off for that
Antony Taylor is the worst ref in the perm  so bias notice how he's not booked a Liverpool player he should get the sack its never a red card
liverpool 1 1 everton interesting..
A penalty, definitely, but a red is very harsh
LiVARpool had VAR on their side. Unfair
liVARpool, dirty scousers, didn't even deserve a point. how Fabinho didnt even get a yellow this game is a disgrace. get Anthony Taylor out of football
Mendy always does that slide in penalties lool..that's his only weakness saving penalties
this season is ours, cmonn liver
Fabinho should have been sent off.
Amazing defending by the boys Tuchel really has revolutionised this side into something else.  (Sorry lamps still love you 💔😂)
LiVARpool had Anthony Taylor as the 12th man on the pitch
anthony taylor ruining the beautiful game
You’ve gotta feel for James though not a red my opinion
TUCHEL IS THE BEST MANAGER IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW
It says Everton instead of Chelsea
What a performance from the Chelsea defenders in that second half with 10 men
Why does it say Liverpool v Everton
this was a disgrace.
It’s a pen but that red is so harsh
Big point for Chelsea! Well deserved! 🙏🏻😎
If that’s a sending off, the rules need to be changed. Clearly not deliberate and came off his thigh first. Penalty + yellow, no double jeopardy it ruins games
What a header from havertz, Chelsea will be serious title contenders with their players. Somebody should have won, but of course, livarpool get the pen, not surprising..
Tuchel wasn't joking when he said he's creating a team that are hard to beat, fair play to Chelsea for being able to hang on 👍🏼
LiVARpool cant even score against 10 men 😂😂
Wtf everton
MOUNT!
WHAT A DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE FROM CHELSEA WHAT A FEELING CMOOOOON
Missed chance by LFC
Great game
Everton played well.
When Liverpool fans says it's not a red, you know the ref made a big mistake..
Penalty was a fair one, but the red card was a bit harsh
Defo a red
Everton?
I can’t believe I have the second  Commentary
What a goal from havertz, he’s gonna be great this year
Chelsea showed why they wilI be PL champion pure Resilience
Ah yes everton
As a United fan i see this as an absolute win :)
Here befor they change Everton to Chelsea
Mendy MOTM what a performance..
Chelsea 💙💙💙
Anthony Taylor one of the worst refs to play the game…
