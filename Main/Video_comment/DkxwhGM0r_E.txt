Big time money pit...
M3 😊 love it
££££££££££££££
This build once complete is going to be insane. That being said, giveaway soon???
Wish it was longer video ricky lad. Not wait 4 days for next tool lol
Some set up 😊
I’ll assume you have a fire extinguisher in the glove box for a build like this Ricky.
Nice to the get the person building the car in the vid..must not been cheap!
Professor Raza on a mad one again. He did this in the Evolve M5 1000 brake video as well. Great knowledge.
This build is gonna be mental 🚀
Oh shit. Did this Raz guy ever get battered by DMO?
Raza is the spicy plug.
Yeah sick guy big builddd
Beast
Will be driven once then raffled off to someone who can’t afford to insure or run it
Why this guy always ruin cars 🤣
Guessing you don't have issues with steering column on the S58 top mount ST?
I love Ricky , no homo , mostly because he's chilled and black and he bought a car out of South Africa which just really made me like him even more , Ricky can you buy a MK1 Golf R we have ones here i think it's 2009 versions it has 1.8i motors and a factory bodykit get one and modify it
Happy New Year Ricky ! Wish you and your family to be healthy and prosperous. Keep living the dream and producing such a quality content. That build will be something that no one has ever seen for sure
Perfection❤
Very excited about this 😍
Beast mate
Waiting for this to get raffled😂😂😂
Damn, RK really knows his stuff!
How high are you gonna rev the car?  Over 8k?
Didn't he build the m5 🤔
A Fully Built 1300× bhp engine in a near 2 ton  car don't make sense for me, as there's no way  it's usable in the Uk.  Ricky, why not build an e46 with all the M3 Running gear all dragged and see what it can do in a lightweight body. It seems a waste of all that power only to  lose half of it due to weight!😮😮
Soon on top 🏆
Yo my brother this is sick iv got a auid a6 avant for the family motor! As my old man said can’t go wrong with an estate! Trying to blag an s6 wid the mrs 👀 I’ll get there one day 😅. But Yh I look forward to seeing this weapon on the channel 👊🏻
Bring on part 3
Does your intro say "max speed no vaccine" in the lyrics? 😂 i really hope it does 😂
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I just don't understand why you'd go to America when you can get better in Europe
We’re about is the car meet
Was waiting on the second part ya dog. Upload more man we miss u.
So this turbo kit will be available for the UK spec right hand drive cars?
Sick
How much is this set up?
Ricky's off to the moon 🚀 🫡
Can’t wait for a Sid & Ricky collab on this M3 when she’s finished. Wanna see it sideways 💨
Good stuff
are you having high output ignition system?
This will be absolute weapon, supercar can’t wait to see it in the summer at some shows
nice
Yes Ric's, your not rampin, you got it going on..👌
This is like being back at college/uni learning from a master tech engineer 👏
The confidence and knowledge is impressive. Some tuners just have that and many others you really struggle to believe they are doing their own r&d and sometines with some tuners on the net you just cant believe they have the firsy clue.  Great video. Thx
Price ?
Weird, no notification 😕
Next level
Sooooooo interesting and informative 🇯🇲 💯
Please bring it to OG battles and carwow
I wonder how much the raffle tickets will be on this build.
Ricky bro!  Next level stuff!! Good on you for bringing this level of build to the peoples!
We're is the billet civic engine Ricky
A highly strung modified engine relying on parts still in R & D phase in relation to a block with sleeves!? Make sure you check your AA cover is up to date Ricky.
It’s you going to be such a beast!!!  What is the goal in terms of quarter mile times? A 7 second time?
Gonna be an absolute weapon Bro , another stunning build beyond the moon 💪🏽🤛🏽😎🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too short bro, waiting 2 weeks for this😂
Ricky your getting a space shuttle built👍 , brilliant vid keep up the content 😀
When is part 3 dropping Ricky?
Cool but I'd rather see some old school videos in crazy cars.
Jesus this is going to be nuts Rick
Insane attention to detail...cabbie will be hauling..bro
Levels!! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
I'm so gassed for this build literally 😅😂💪🏿😎🍻
Raz is like the David Attenborough of buillding engines. Could listen to him all day 😌
👌
Wow!! What an intricate build..🔥🔥
Some set up 😮
This channel is seriously underrated, and deserves so much more. The quality to production is amazing bro. Loving the m3 👌🏽
This build is nuts ,but I quite like it👍😉💪
