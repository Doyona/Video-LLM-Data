arsonist on the loose
It's the Kings Cross disaster reborn‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Why do southerners never shut up?
Live local.   There was no real FIREBALL. It wasn’t at the station but was under the arches ...a few lockup’s caught fire. Tube and train tracks unaffected. all over very quickly.  It’s not like PORTLAND ffs- BLM ANTIFA would be embarrassed it’s so small scale.   Talk about making it a drama !
This person should never record another video
I didn't see this on BBC World.
Thats super fun.
If it happened in London why is it called New York Post
hehehe stoke the fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
London bridge is falling down, falling down.....
JESUS CHRIST is our hope!
Fire ball ?  It looks like your regular insurance job to me..
UPDATE: the fire might have been caused by gas cylinders also there is a possible death in that fire and there is now 8 injured
Walk it off your fine
Any terrorist attacks
Hope to everyone is ok
Lol chanel fake news
It wasn't that massive! BTW, thanks for sharing.
Just another incident stopping train services in London. 😏
inside job 100%
If I'm not mistaken, that garage has been there for quite some time (many, many, many years at least) and I don't recall there ever being a fire there. Strange how the NEW YORK Post picked this up before many UK outlets...
LOOK FOR the SMOKY BEAR @ 1:42
At 1:42 did anyone see the SMOKY BEAR coming over the rooftop?
UK outlets didn't report anything about this accident we have to find out from new York post
They are awful slow getting  water on the  fire
This should be titled "camera operator discovers the zoom settings".
Freedom has no price! ❤
Back draft
Mankind always got chaos going on! Heavenly Father, Creator of mankind help us please 🙏 . Forgive us for our sins, and restore our souls.
Underground lava flows  and cables
Should we assume this is a pEaCeFuL pRotESt?
The work of those poor economic refugees rescued invading Britain from the english channel.
0:38 when the smoke diminished gases build up quickly in confined spaces that what did fire ball what was on fire
Just like with Miami: Suggest bomb in comments, get instant gaslighting attack. Why is this?
Worst cameraman ever
fire under the  railway arches,  FWIW railway station not train station.
Time for the Tea fire dept bring loads of Tea🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Fire in the hole.
Don't have to live in the USA to get a fireball as the cause is unknown as this could have been while the marching was on going on the 26th June 2021
Has anyone claimed responsibility for this yet..??   Matt Hancock - No.?     Anyone.?
just another day in londonistan
Must’ve been the wind that caused it.
It’s a fire in an auto shop, the conspiracy nuts need to calm the eff down.
Those dizzying camera angles though!!
Insurance job
£25 worth of damage is estimated
Thanks for sharing.
WE ARE IN THE END TIMES NOW ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST INTO YOUR HEART AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR BEFORE ITS TOO LATE DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND IN THE TRIBULATION OR BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU GET READY FOR THE END
greetings from the 00's
Matt halfcock burning some files most likely
I hear covid 19 on mask got too hot and exploded.
Where is Covid restrictions
Don’t worry just a peaceful BLM fire. We can all go home now
absolute garbage fake news and fear mongering
Leepu and Bernie up to their old tricks
Oi meu Deus meu pai
are they shorting out e-car batterys for bombs now?
Wondering if fuel was stored there?
Hope everyone is ok
How old is this place?
hope everybody is okay and praying for the people that live near there x
They sometimes start fired to avoid paying workers after big jobs.
Bomb factory underneath the arches??
Looks like a real classy part of town !!  Hope they dont waste too much water on it.
Evidence burying again.
"London Calling"
I wonder how the fire started in there
Looks like a friendly diverse area.
It’s a fire.  Don’t make a big deal out of it.  I was in the fire service for 30 years.
Is this spontraineous combustion?…………
Charlene don't like it...  No. Wait... Sorry,wrong song..
London fire brigade certainly rush don't they ! Not
Glad I wasn’t there (as I was meant to be) today!
Attack off virus.
Beautiful smoke
It’s not a train station it’s a garage in the railway arch and no BLM wouldn’t stand a chance in our United Kingdom lasted all of a month here lol logic wins
It was a car garage that caught on fire
Hope no one got seriously hurt , brings up old Grenville tower 😢.

Maybe it's an insurance scam. Khan will do anything to ring money out of people.
FFS. It wasn't at elephant n castle, it was BENEATH it. You're no better than RT: HUGE EXPLOSION ROCKS LONDON.
Beats reporting on the hundred of people demonstrating in the streets. You really are corrupt and do not have the interests of the People.
Jim Davidson used to film there in the 1980s
It’s caused thousands of pounds of improvements.
the false flags starting agian
Another video I've seen you could clearly see explosions, just saying..
someone needs to take some videography courses  ,I got motion sickness watching the video
Fire erupts at car repair workshop next to station... get it right.
Cue the loony anti-government, anti-vaccine, terrorism, pro-trump, anti-biden, anti-'MSM' comments.
Not the station ..it's a car repair shop in the arches !
BLM responsible cos there was a poster of Morrissey on the wall.
The health minister for Great Britain is exposed for breaking his own covid rules....... oh look a fire!
UK Column news ( TRUE NEWS FOLKS )
8pm in UK and still no MSM coverage. Hmmmmm
I live in New York NYPD it's probably going to have to step up there patrols hear let's hope this was just unforeseen incident and not a another act of terrorism
Putin?
It’s a dump round there anyway.
It's in a Auto Garage under an enclosed Archway. Probably Butane containers .
This is the last straw
It's the autocentre that's on fire
Don't worry folks.  Biden will save you.
Probably one of those pesky exploding fridges' !!!!
near the station, not at.
Put the fire out with the jabs
not a train station!!!!! do you see trains????
Gee, hope harry wasn't nearby
that looks like a very hot fire
Oh please, elephant and castle was top of the line. This is man made.
Stubborn flames spread all over London 📿
Praise Allah......
oh this looks on purpose. I sure hope not.
Lots of construction/maintenance work been going on there for a bit, plus it’s right next to auto repair centres and other industrial stuff.
Karma je prava stvar
Pudding Lane. 1666......But that one ended the great plague.
So did Monty Python get the naming rights for this train station?
all the locals know the TYPE that own this place and work there .The insurance claim will be a laugh
That's one way for change. Especially old structural design .
Why is it not on the ITV and BBC news they probably weren't planning perhaps it went off a day to  soon or a day late
_Islamophobia : This was caused by a terrorist attack_
Due to Brexit cutbacks we can't keep the Elephant and Castle station.
Massive fireball but everything is fine.
I enjoyed your video, i am actually tired of worrying about stock and stuff.... It's driving me nuts these days I think crypto investment is far better than stocks
What a mess! Prayers for victims
How does a "massive fireball" erupt at.a train station? Hmmm maybe Spontaneous human combustion?
Where's Le Chiffre right now?
Oh no
Hope nobody was hurt.
Maybe it’s people peaceful protesting that mandatory tracking device!
Terrorism? In London, I'm going to say yes.
Hope no one was hurt... 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Mostly peaceful terror attack.
It's all blown over. Hugo and Charles are mopping up. 🥃👍
White Supremacy and Climate change are at it again.
A Mostly Peaceful Protest
