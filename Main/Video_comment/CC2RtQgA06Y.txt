Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future….
he rlly is the king of the galaxy 🥶

Dear Tron,   I write as tcampsdesigns, before I started listening to you, my tiktoks got no views, and I was sharing a mattress with 8 of my homies. After listening to you, my tiktok has started blowing up and now I'm a multibillionaire and I think I may buy twitter from elon musk. Thanks Tron

BABYTRON JUST SO HARD MAN LOWKEY MAKES ME HARD
multiple hits on one song.
Hardest one
I've thought BabyTron was a likable persona/artist/person since I first started hearing about him. NGL tho it took me listening to a few of his tracks to get the vibes. I get it, it just clicked. The whole style and everything is dope. I love these mashup type mix traps. I was never a hater at all but I really like what BabyTron is doing. Honestly I don't want to compare to any other artists in rap or otherwise but I think BabyTron is one of the most exciting and interesting artists coming up right now. I fw it.
Trash  Music stealer
Greek town! I took picture at the statue he’s at in this MV ❤
Had to backhand my lil cousin he jus spiked some wocky😭

ily too tron 🙏🏾
Dam bro so you telling me BabyTron so great he both Lil Wayne and made the original 6 foot 7 foot?? Dam mans a pioneer frfr
2:07 damn
He a hot head Funna go check his fahrenheit 🔥🔥
True rapper with no focus, collectively a piece of raw shit and nothing original with style, just got old concepts and had his producer do all the work in the studio, bro had no continuous flow, dude probably read this shit off a paper and recorded these bars 2 or 3 at a time. Honestly Music is supposed to tell a story or a struggle and all this does is show and list his perpetual ignorance of his actions and mental illness that he has either never been diagnosed for or is ignoring the blaring facts about what he's stating in his music and does in these videos is making his actual illness even worse for himself and his followers. No actual artist or athlete or just professional in any area of the entertainment industry would ever succeed with a style or concept that is so inconsistent (or relies on inconsistency of beat switch ups as there consistent), because you're always trying bite or switch up to a bigger sample that you didn't produce yourself, or pay for, lease out jewelry, a shit car, and bad producers that make you sound a decent soundcloud rapper from the early 2000's and you get BabyTronSB. Get off your own dick and say something worth saying that hits and relays a consistent message or concept for those who actually listen to this raw sewage, thinking they found the next LIl Wayne, cause like people with real ADHD like me would agree, we do not to perpetuate the stereotype of a short attention span/memory to gain the lowest common denominators, by dressing in shit clothes, where sunglasses like your high 24/7, and hope people know what you mean, when you say a whole lot of made up words that only exist to complete the verse and you wouldn't do half the shit you say, and I can tell cause the only people you got in that video is the producers you paid to be there and help you make this shit. Go back to your Mom's basement, and don't comeback out until you complete one god damn song with no more than one switch up,  last more than 3 minutes, and listeners don't have to ask themselves why they wasted their precious time in life to listen to you waste the oxygen you inhale to say absolutely nothing . And take your goddamn meds bro, looks you taking the wrong drugs homie. Hope you own your masters (I know you don't) .Gud luck living past 25.
how can you not fuck with tron?
Babytrons my only reason to keep going. Without babytron i would’ve ended it already. If babytron didn’t rap I would’ve been gone. Babytron my only reason to get up in the morning. Babytron is my savior. I would do anything for babytron. If he told me too jump off a bridge I would say where and when.

Before I’d heard a Babytron song, I was homeless, drug addicted, and depressed. Thanks to hearing his genre-busting and boundary-pushing music, I have found true purpose and meaning in life. I am now a multibillionaire, and I wake up with a smile on my face. Thanks Tron.

BabyTron. This song has changed my ENTIRE life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This song represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But I can. Thanks to this song I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Mr. Tron once again never fails to disappoint. God bless your souls. Without you or these songs id probably be listening to some random named Lil Durk and throwing the GDK up religiously. But god has sent you here to stop this madness from ever happening. Thank you for this exquisite song.
are these all full songs or nah??
He’s so goated, drop this and the last one in apple music
Imagine if he made all these singles

Protect babytron at all cost. man never miss gahdamn
🔥🔥🔥
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Hell nah 4:00 the best part wtf
Wayment this man went through other niggas beats and spazzed on all of em

1 Corinthians 8:6  But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.
Make a all old school one😭🔥

Production credits on this long asf

The beat arrangement order makes this borderline unbearable to listen to. It's extremely inconsistent and doesn't mesh well. He can rap, but what's the point if the arrangement off?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just wanna let you know you came up on suggested videos, and I made sure to downvote before I requested your channel to not be suggested again

Goat talk
Thank you tron you really turned my life around. I used to be so addicted to getting no pussy and getting into credit card debt. I used to go to sleep hungry now I wake up and see franklins. Now I wake up and eat some fancy shit, this some creme brûlée. No joke, if I push the button imma end the game. Walking thru the mall I hope a YouTuber test this chain.
So many things to go’ogle, like how to have your ex "crawling back to you" and feel like "THE MAN". When you really want to take advantage of your innate potential and become someone who is just magnetic to anyone, rad something like Treitan Mellory's Simple Paper.
🥶🥶🥶🥶
babytron on the youtube trending check the power rankings
Greatest rapper of all time
🔥🔥
Unreal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where tf I’m at? I think I’m n da club !! I might make it thunderstorm I’m playing w a dub!!

Bro too hard for this
This nigga 4 pieced  20 beats 💀🔥🔥🔥
Ended that deal properly, really tho
🔥🔥
Huh?
another mill otw 👑
After so much go’ogling, he majority of us already know the way to get an ex back. Probably you just require that little extra shove, and have absolutely everything placed into basic words and workable actions. reading Treitan Mellory's Simple Paper is a great 15 day example that seldom fails.
This nigga can’t be stopped 🤧🤧🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Need a song on the slim shady beat
wtf
This nigga outrageous bro

Prior to discovering babytron I was a bum, constantly depressed due to a lack of money and bitches. After hearing prince of the mitten and this I can confidently say my life has turned around 100 percent. I actually just recently scammed a dying cancer patient and now my money is up. Thank you babytron!

Emperor of the universe coming next?
10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours. 2. No matter where you go, you're there. 3. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.  4. Honk if you like peace and quiet. 5. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  6. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 7. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 8. I intend to live forever. So far so good.  9. All generalizations are false.   10. What's another word for "thesaurus"?    Editorial: Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

When that 🍋 from Gucci Mane dropped
Before I listened to tron, I was nothing. A loser you could say. One day my homie said, "hey have you heard babytron?". I said no, so he turned on early bird. I heard the pure emotions coming from his words. I cried deep emotional tears and realized at that very moment I could make something of myself. I turned my life around and became a very cool person and broke out of my shell. He saved me.

My 2 year old son one night was wide awake and humming. I said "son, you have never talked so what is this you are humming now?" He opened his mouth slowly and started rapping the entire king of the galaxy song word for word, bar for bar!! After he finished I was shocked, I was flabbergasted, but nothing short of proud. 10 years on and my son is now 12. He has asked to change his name to The Second Prince of Mitten and is now a full time, 9-5 Balaclava wearing, Cartier shading, Swipe Star. Thankyou James "BabyTron" Johnson for your motivation and positivity in my scam sons life. Couldn't be prouder!! #SB #SleeveNash

Tron jumped on dat lane changing 👀
BabyTron. This song has changed my ENTIRE life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This song represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But I can. Thanks to this song I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Mr. Tron once again never fails to disappoint. God bless your souls. Without you or these songs id probably be listening to some random named Lil Durk and throwing the GDK up religiously. But god has sent you here to stop this madness from ever happening. Thank you for this exquisite song.
Prior to discovering babytron I was a bum, constantly depressed due to a lack of money and bitches. After hearing prince of the mitten and this I can confidently say my life has turned around 100 percent. I actually just recently scammed a dying cancer patient and now my money is up. Thank you babytron!
Before I listened to tron, I was nothing. A loser you could say. One day my homie said, "hey have you heard babytron?". I said no, so he turned on early bird. I heard the pure emotions coming from his words. I cried deep emotional tears and realized at that very moment I could make something of myself. I turned my life around and became a very cool person and broke out of my shell. He saved me.
You so versatile bra
Gotta make all these full length songs on an ep fr.
Tron done did it again
Baby Tron awesome man love your creativity be blessed 🔥

Babytron is a cheat code. How you unlock every flow? Bro a Prestige Master
I dont usually drop hatin' ass comments but this is ain't a flex, it's wack fr. You got errybody excited that you can flow on beats that hundreds of people already rapped to, and you ain't do one of em better. Sorry mane, it's cool but you shoulda tried harder instead of acting like you gods gift to rappin. I done heard most of your lines before so you just not standin out. Business wise though this shit was smart as hell, I can't knock the hustle or originality of this idea.
Niggas said tron only rap on Detroit beats….. yeh yeh okay here you go bozo
