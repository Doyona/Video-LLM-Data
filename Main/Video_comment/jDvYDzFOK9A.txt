Nothing but love your friendly Angel Jack.... Another story for youApples and pears      One day there was a father he had a house and three sons his wife had passed years ago and he raised his three sons to be generous loving and kind one time this man talked to his sons into bed told the first one I want you to go out tomorrow while I'm at work and I want you to pick pears old bucketful then he said good night and went to the second son to the second son he said I want you to go out tomorrow and pick apples a whole bucket full while I'm at work and then he said good night and went to the third son to the third son he said I want you to go out and pick oranges a whole bucket full and then he said good nights and then he himself went to bed in the morning while the children were still asleep he went to work the children got up and the first child said to the third one I remember father said pick fruit told us to pick fruit the second one said yes I remember father said pick fruit so all three of the boys went outside and grabbed a bucket and the first boy said okay time to pick pears the second boy said no we're picking apples the third boy said you're both wrong dad said pick oranges and before you know it all three of them are bruised and bloody from fighting in the yard the father comes home seize the boys fighting in the yard and the father says what are you fighting over I told you pick fruit and you haven't picked no fruit empty buckets are sitting here on the lawn and the boys started telling him all talking at once about the different fruits they were arguing over the father said I didn't tell you all to pick the same fruit I am making a fruit salad. Just because your brother has to do one thing and I ask you to do another doesn't mean you have to argue over it just do what you feel is right which is Follow My Lead and go get me some fruit for the salad this is a cute story about a father and his sons but it's also a comparative Three Sons could represent  three religions the father could represent God we all argue over things spiritual but we all don't need to feel the same way I hope you enjoyed my story blessings to everyone your friendly Angel Jack

Letra How can one become so bounded By choices that somebody else makes? How come we've both become a version Of a person we don't even like? We're in love with the world But the world just wants to bring us down By putting ideas in our heads That corrupt our hearts somehow When I was a child Every single thing could blow my mind Soaking it all up for fun But now I only soak up wine They say to play hard, you work hard Find balance in the sacrifice Yet I don't know anybody Who's truly satisfied You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying) To keep climbing (climbing, climbing) But the higher we climb Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh) So I hope I learn to get over myself Stop trying to be somebody else So we can love each other for free Everybody wants something You just want me Why am I obsessing About the things I can't control? Why am I seeking approval From people I don't even know? In these crazy times I hope to find Something I can cling on to 'Cause I need some substance in my life Something real, something that feels true You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried) High tides (high tides, high tides) 'Cause I want you so bad But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh) Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself Stop trying to be somebody else Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) Love you for free (each other for free) Everybody wants something from me You just want me Listen, I know how low I can go I give as good as I get You get the brunt of it all 'Cause you're all I've got left Oh, I hope in time (hope in time) We both will find (we both find) peace of mind Sometimes the road less traveled Is a road best left behind (ahh) Well, I hope I learn to get over myself Stop trying to be somebody else Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) Love you for free, yeah (each other for free) 'Cause everybody wants something from me You just want me You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying) To keep climbing (climbing, climbing) But the higher we climb Feels like we're both none the wiser The only regret I have I wish that it was just at a different time A most turbulent period of my life Why would I put that on you? That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about But because of that period of time Even though it was so much fun I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him There was just memories in a big storm
Worse song from Adele. 🫣

My heart is so broken 😢
This is a masterpiece!!!
I love the song it's really good. Here's a story for you. It's a dream I had that means a lot to me, I hope you enjoy it....The fountain One day when I was a young man I had a dream in this dream two angels came down and grabbed me by the arms ripped me a ride out of bed as we flew through all of creation in a way I cannot describe I asked them where we're going they answered you wanted to see the Fountain of all power we're going to show it to you they took me into the desert into the middle of nowhere where I found a cave they stood me outside the front of the cave lady wisdom Sophia herself I had spent the last 3 years walking with almost every night it was when I went to sleep I started class one that would teach me wisdom this seemed to be my graduation she took me into the cave and we wandered around for tunnels for what must be miles then suddenly the cave opened up the ceiling about 30 ft up it was about 30 ft in diameter big cave at the far end was three steps and a cylinder like a fountain in the center but 18-in beam of energy that the ceiling I thought this is the Fountain of all power there's no guards there's no barbed wire there's no machine guns the Fountain of power and nobody's guarding it what's wrong with this picture so I mustered up the courage and with the thrust of my hand I said I am the high mass of brem wa as if to take whatever power was there somebody needed to control it it might as well be me but just as my hand got about 6 in from the energy another hand jumped out of it grabbed mine said Jesus Holy Redeemer how can I help I just said good to know you're sitting there better you than me better me than my brother but better you than me and then he pulled me into that 18-in beam of energy I could not see through it but my right hand my head one of my shoulders was inside well the rest of me was outside but it seemed to me that my head was poking outside another beam somewhere else it was like the beam had a whole new dimension on the inside on the outside there was a whole different dimension so the inside was the outside and outside had another inside I don't know it gets kind of confusing I'll try not to think about it at this point he says to me I'm going to put a mark on your ankle so that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt this is a real thing and he pushed me back out of the fountain kind of got fuzzy real white I woke up in my bed I shook my head didn't believe what I had wasn't anything more than a dream just a dream then I looked at my left ankle on the end step of my left ankle I saw a design looked like half lamb half lion and underneath it was JHR all run together like a monogram in varicose veins I still have this Mark today God is real God is love Got is blessings God is protection god is defense god is guidance God provides he is the Holy Redeemer and all it seems to me that I can do is love but maybe that's enough blessings to everyone thank you for reading this one day when I was young I had a dream in this dream two angels grab me by the arms ripped me out of bed and I flew through the cosmos with courage knowing that God is with you God is true fill  your life yourself with the divine frequencies  and you may see your life get more positive massively thank you for reading this.                 your angel friend Jack
