If only we played Donny constantly he would be a baller now and we wouldn’t need eriksen and he’d have a chance to win the fa cup against city tomorrow
MU must quickly secure the services of de jong, don't waste time

Why would u watch this crap and not on sky sport 😂
First comment after 6 Months
"I'd rather have Josh king than Cavani"  Aged very well , didn't it ?
I’m a time traveler and we will get sancho and varane nxt summer
YouTube why are you recommending it to me now. Do you want to say me something?
aged well
This is on trending 😂😂
Sancho is here now ❤️❤️
It least we have him now
Sancho done
4:18:24 I’d rather have Josh king than Cavani 😂😂

Whose here after we've won the league
Is that truce? From Laura mangan
I'm just keeping it one hundred... I don't trust ole gunnar solksjaer...
Flex waffles
90% 😂😂😂
imagine sancho in liverpool
The best and ONLY effective campaign is to target the twitter accounts of our club Sponsers with negative messages, encourage the funs to share and retweet! That will hit the owners where it hurts.
They are all good players ,I wanted a striker with name and reputation we have cavani now ...a good left back in telles ,facundo isn't a winger he is something like mata on the right , he will be very good ....and Amad diallo is proper dribbler and winger ...this all I wanted .....we all have our cup of tea ,but if man city signed facundo for David Silva sake and he become a better player even world class we will say we don't have director and club running poor ,if Dortmund bought diallo we say the same ...to me it doesn't get better than this ,it easy to talk here ...let appreciate,let the ones we have bought already pull up their weight ,or the manager get ruthless
very irrelevant at this moment, but anyone else want life to be like it was when we would vibe to rockefeller street... cuz same
I think your Manchester United manager, should just sell the full squad for a quid, but don't forget to get 50 pence change.
not mad at cavani signing offers a lot more than rashford and martial jst hes age is the problem

Someone give me the time stamp for Cavani vs Josh king
Absolutely dreadful transfer window from United
Funny how Mark never attacks maguire cos he is English
Ages is a number look at zaltan pratbridge
Cavani is quality fergerson always wanted to sign him don't listen to pratbridge
Ew
how is he so positive that people will join man united after that loss
GOALS GOALS COME ON OLE. WE GOT CANAVI STOP CRYING GUYS.
Transfer Rashford
Why waste valuable deadline day time on cavani!? A free agent! We could sign him next week and concentrate on more pressing deals. Nonsense deadline day theatre to fool angry fans 100%!
Not one Manc on this Man United video.
Depression.
Number one on trending for me lol
Hey you, yeah you can you read my name ? thanks
*Hi Guys My Mom Told That If I got 2000* *Subs She's gonna buy me a Puppy* *I was waiting for it but it all depends on* *your help* *Iam not a bot to prove it ill reply to the* *comments on my channel!😐😐*
Woodward out
Mark is so angry he forgot the word incoming.
Such a bad transfer window hopefully the young boys grow n become world class!!!
Why do mummies like Christmas so much?
No.1 on Trending, the anti-woodward exodus starts congrats Mark!
4:38:30 arsenal bit 🤣🤣🤣
A. Sanchez is out 🙌
Joke signing! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
As a Gooner, I think it’s a disgrace calling Maguire an £80m fridge.. actual fridges are more mobile!
For everyone who complain n complaint, keep your life miserable.  Not getting Sancho is just a loss in ego. We don't need him TBH.   With this current signing, we gonna do well. Can't wait to watch this team. Luv United. GGMU ❤💪
By your logic it’s 80milliin because you need to add January Bruno deal
Mark: “They know what this club means to us, the fans, we line their pockets” Me: “Why you got soooo many ads”?? Mark: “so Fans can line my pockets”!!!
United is still did not get Harry Maguire's partner of course and one midfielder and is where the problem is
fantastic work mark. great show 🔥
Woodward /glazers bleed pounds and dollars not red.
Cavani is world class mate
I will stand against this board forever
4:32 Moments before disaster
Got to be one of the worst transfer windows ever. We get rid of Alexi Sanchez and end up buying Cavani. Talk about not learning from your mistakes. So as well as an ageing striker we get a left back, one position in my opinion we didn’t need to try and fix, then a young lad who’s played 34 minutes of professional football. Oh add to that Van Der Beek who doesn’t even seem to be a player to be starting. Why didn’t we just get Partey who would of started? Shambles. Absolute shambles.
cavani=another sanchez. OMG
What time did Mark and Flex argue?
Hey Mark
“Sancho will DEFINITELY sign Sancho” - Mark, virtually all of summer 😅
Edinson cavani will have the same impact as zaltan mark my word why no one is attacking maguire cos he is English
Shambles
Only time we getting Sancho is when he’s in his 30+ LMFAO
SARR IS RED 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
In next 5-10 days we need a great defender or a coach with good knowledge of defensive aspectto be brought in to coaching staff as we need to improve current players dramatically or we are doomed.  I feel this will be most difficult year in football especially with a pandemic
I’m glad we didn’t sign sancho he’s not worth what they were asking for him
Ole going to get the sack soon. Board not backing him is obvious........
The reason Demebele never turned up is because his name is Demebele not dum-bele.
We’re gonna be arsenal. I said it. Its true. Its gonna go over for a few more years i bet my life
Banter a side, one thing is for sure. Sancho 100% forced a move. He didn't play, didn't train, Was "ill" but somehow manged to attend tammy birthday. Feel sorry for you lot.
We need a new fucking united
October: WOODWARD OUT November: GLAZERS OUT December: OLE OUT  January: SANCHO TRANSFER ON!!
Next summer.  Mbappe to real madrid Salah to psg Sancho to Liverpool
Hate complaining but I love this club ! If we go anywhere near this dembele deal I will be ole out , where is the common sense ?
Anyone got the patience to put the time stamps for the major moments,?
Ole is not the right manager for this club
Save the 60 million for a proper winger or cdm or cb
Mark knew the deadline had passed Christ sake german reporters knew that! The media in England blow this up as well their just a selling club no and this COVID thing their players are worth more at their club than selling ie sancho is worth to them now more than united where going to offer
Lots of love from Nepal 🇳🇵
90% 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Why isn't Facundo on your signing list?
We need a good defence ..plz woodward ..
One love from Jamaica 🇯🇲  We will rise the a Phoenix  Just need  to have faith in the boys ❤️
Note this today, Leeds United will beat us black and blue!!! Because if you have taking your time watch them play, you will no that we’re no where near them currently now!!!
Mark new video : sancho aggree deal with united on january..haha where is sancho mark??
Are you gone start SARR CAMPAIGN NOW???
So long as Woodward is still in charge of transfers, Man Utd will never win an EPL title again. Like if you agree
wait so we didn’t get sancho ??? awww man who would have seen that 😕
An utter disgrace.   They ruined that club
Manchester United will finish 15th in the table!
Mark was looking for ur video on the trashing...6-1!?
Transfer window...off target!!
lol 4 billion? the fans need to go to Dubai and beg the Saudis lol
So we've signed  Van de beek  Edinson cavani  Alex telles Amad traore  Facundo Pellistri
Why don't we get a good centre back or swap one of ours with an E.F.L. Championship team ?
It’s official now, man united don’t have vision, the board lacks vision to pilot the affairs of this club to another level!!!!
How can Man united give this old man number 7 shirt!!!! At the age of 33+ he has not played ball for so many months, is man United Now a Chinese club? A prayer that is thinking about retirement, Shame on U!!!
Hope the United board get bad luck for life
WE GOT PARTEY LETS GO, HAHAHA
If fit Cavani should start. He is better than any striker we have and he can hold the ball up. If he gets service he will outscore any forward we have right now.
It will be a miracle to finish top 4 now..
Sad thing is, most of us fans will lay in bed thinking wtf just happened... Meanwhile, Woodward and his buddies will sleep till noon tomorrow...
Trust me, transfer season doesn't purely reflect season (look at arsenal last yr: best window, worst season), it's much more about the manager, which is the worry NC
Facundo is in too
Looking at how it went down, it seems like Woodward has a very different definition for "backed"... Will go down well in prison once he's there for fraud...
so much pain
Like Evra said there are 100% people in this club who do not want us to succeed
gg bois
I'm curious about Pellistri though...
I beelieve we have signed Facundo pellistri from penarol
Ed wood out we have to protest against this tyrant
6 months hyping up Sancho What a PRAT
Bit harsh on romero
United stand clips should make a Sancho deal compilations video to mark all the ups and downs in these few months!
We still suffering b'se of center back
Lots of love from japan 🇯🇵
Such a bad transfer window hopefully the young boys grow n become world class in the future
It’s going to be absolutely fantastic not to have to see any more Sancho news
Fuming
Cavani no 7 = flop
