Who’s watching the other stream and saw Envy win
I'm a sex trafficking victim who has been raped and brainwashed by my family since I was a teenager. They have attempted to murder me. I have mental illness because of what they did to me. It feels like I am being constantly abused by them. They are trying to force me to commit suicide. They are trying to wear me down until my character has diminished. I don't understand what life is like for normal adults and I am ineffective at trying to fit in. Please don't misunderstand me or what is going on with me. I have no understanding of life itself. They have destroyed my brain with torture. I have tried to call the police but they don't believe me. I have talked to the federal government as well but I have heard nothing back from them. I can't even comprehend how upset I should be about this, I do not understand what it's like for normal people. I should be more mad, I should be fighting harder for my life but I am growing tired. I have already exhausted many options. I have become hopeless. Please check out my music channel and donate to me.
