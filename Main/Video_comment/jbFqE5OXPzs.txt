4:00 The Rain 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh, 4 years later, I’m still watching this skit…. And it still cracks me up!!!…😂😂😂😂
Seller completely overwrote and remastered song of storms into jacket of storms, with a dramatic delay
Darryl Mayes got bricks instead of shoes and Lenarr got a whole storm 😂😂
bro gotta flip phone still?
I lost it when he said.. "DUMBASS... DUMBASS!"
Man i love the phone case
eBay
Is that “premium quality air” actually from the Nike factory? #sarcasm
How he get so much water with literal water pressure in his living room tho
That's what you get for spending 500 on shoes
Jesus loves y'all
That's really how it feels, open the box, and it's some air 😅😭
This is your best video bro 😂😂😂😂😂🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
😂😂😂💀😂😂
You laughed, no refunds xD
The fact the delivery guy still asked for a review 😂😂😂
The rain 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
The air was funny
😂😂😂
Lenarr is too tier
Remember when people used to (and still try) to sell PS5 boxes for $550?
2:58
Deflated ass brain lol
Can someone post the link for the storm in a box?
fr
Lmfao, the arctic wind sound effects when he opened the box was 100.
My man brought legit air with the lines. Lol
That jacket is cold! I think that's the opposite thing too what it's for lol slang nowadays aha
Himmetheh⚜✝️🙏👑
Lenarr made it rain indoors 🤣
Buying anything on ebay at a low price be like
3:19☠
That premium Nike air was blowing through his hair like a York Peppermint Patty commercial
The call really remided me of Caleb  Gotta love the facial expressions in this one
Bro got that spongebob box o' wind
Nobody's gonna read the description bro your gonna have to put "shoes not included" in the title
Then they shouldn't have pictures of the nike air 1000s in the listing
That was VERY funny.
He really bought quality air for $500. I’m dead 💀
😅😅 best believe ni**a catching a cap when I get off the phone... Had the nerves to ask for 4star too 🤣
I'm not forcing this but I have the most true important information/fact to tell you that you need to believe in. We all are sinners and we must get punished for all of our sins by spending eternity in hell, but God sent Christ, his only Son to take the penalty for all of our sins instead by dying on the cross to save us from going to hell and so we can have eternal life with Christ and God in his kingdom. On the third day after Christ died, Christ rose back from the dead. Christ ascended to heaven and he will come back for his chosen ones and take them to heaven. God bless you and have a good day😁
Ausitm
Worst part is this happend to me.
Pov: You didn't read the description
I got a pair of them  Nike 1000s
Quality air from the Nike factory 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:57
It was incredibly thoughtful of the seller to include a jacket for that storm, though. He didn’t have to do that. He’s just a good person.
even though he got “scammed”, eBay dude really figured out how to transport oxygen and natural weather. He prolly be able to save a life or 2.
That's what you get for trying to complain about a man with an honest business 😅
Now that's its been almost 2 years, I remember when people was doing this with the ps5...man.
Yeah you bouta cry 😂
Bro, I’d just file for a refund based off the fact he ain’t mention the storm in the description 👀👀👀
🤣
I hate Lenarr and feel so bad for him at the same time!
Daaaaaaaamn. Let this be a lesson to everyone ordering online.
The Air that flowed.
Deflated ass brain hahaha!!!
What song is this when it starts raining?
THERES A DAMN STORM!!🤣priceless
😂😂😂😂 bruh had a storm in the box
Personally I wouldn’t let him talk to me like that..
Usher You got it bad would have went great in the background when you opened the box
"No refunds"  Is the worst thing to read on any selling platform ever. 🤣🤣🤣
Nike is a deity anyhow
This is so true. People don’t like to read 😄 Terms and Conditions have discouraged us 💀
1:29 got me somehow
I'm watching this at work and almost  died laughing
😂😂😂😂
What's the outro music?
This man look he played him
that storm bit at the end had me in tears lmaooo! ".....ima go get some towels."
The rain for the song at 3:24 makes it even better I could literally fall asleep listening to this
“u good?”  “no” 😭 😭 omg
That's Messed up!!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your mind on sin) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins (this can be anywhere) have a nice day  Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell!  And dressing sexually/posing sexually is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be and the same applies for listening to music with sin in the lyrics and the same applies for insulting people even when they insult you and being toxic   And show mercy to be shown mercy by God And good deeds are kind acts that the person doing it has no cost for it.  And I'm not a bot
ebay scammers lol
W YouTuber crazy I been watching for 2 years now
2:58 Tuff
Lmaoo😂😂😂😂
You good ? No
The PSA for eBay buyers ever
scammer sounds like his father
Plot twist his friend recording was the one who actually sold him the box of air
I really dont get people who are excited by runners.
that's true friendship. a guy who won't laugh and he'll just get u a towel
Lol "he sent u some air" 😂😂😂
I know he wanna cry too, but not in front of the cameras.
The air effect 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
That third party seller really said " Nike Air." 🤣👍
Just realized he ain't get the shoes.  But you got a whole weather machine in the box.  And free jacket. I'd pay 500 for a free jacket lol   And I mean that Air must have been some high quality air because he never complained about the air just not having the shoes. Lol let's not judge I saw 2 chainz huffing on 5k air before lol
Exactly why niggas use stockx 🤣🤣🤣
everybody who witnessed this laughed except homie in the black shirt
This is the same guy who scammed Caleb of his new “phone”. 🤣
That lil ahh piece of paper towel 😂😂😂
I clicked on this video thinking it was CalebCity.
The Aggretsuko case :D
Why am I the friend? XDDDDD
the finger flicking sent me XDDD
Not the unboxing table🤣
That nigga brought some air🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
Funny thing ebay takes the side of buyers now more than sellers even if they say no refunds
Hey, man. I just wanted to let you know that you're my favorite skit-guy. You hit people in a different way. I try to like all your videos because I want more people to know you and see your stuff. You literally have me bursting out with laughter whenever I see your skits. Thank you, man!!! I love your work!!!
When he saw the box empty his soul left his body
The whole thing was hilarious, but I died when he was offering that one piece of paper towel. This man is drenched, depressed, angry; and he is like, here is this one piece of paper towel.😂😅😂
Why He so handsome to me.... that skin and them lips!!! Lawd!! You like Cougars?
They bought a dad but it gave me a letter to inform me that he went to go get milk
This why I don’t shop on eBay. One too many listings for empty boxes on there.
Ouch
I would've broken down with tears just by looking at Lennar's face at that moment.
If you're ever trying to buy an external hard drive from amazon or walmart be careful. They sell external hard drive cases that look just like the hard drive and it'll even say it can hold like 500 gigabytes or some shit. But yea always read the description.
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I used to work for Amazon so I felt it when customers called with these third party sellers it's so sad😂
"You good?"  "Nah man....I'm pretty f***in' far from ok...."
Meow
Yo you made the video 9 secs too long g
This actually happened with the ps5 and xbox series X. It was a test to see how  impatient and stupid people can be. He would sell them at the normal retail price and send only the box. It clearly said read the description that pointed out that it was the the box. You won't believe how many sales he got.
Air-1000
Gave you 1000 molecules of air from the Nike factory
naaawwww straight wind lol
Lenarr you are the funniest skit guy on YT
4 mil Lenard
when the air noise started I lost it! HAHAHAHAHA!
The friend was a real one for not laughing. Too many of THOSE
My dude hands him a single sheet of paper towel 🤣
I really felt that even though I never did that before
2:58
1:06 their faces after opening the empty box 🤣🤣🤣
Deflated ass brain 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 omg
And I ain't goin lie am I the only one that thought it was depressing when he was getting rained on😭😭😔
I would lowkey buy a rainstorm its calming
A similar thing happened to me, I bought a Ben Tennyson hoodie I was excited to get the package. But when it arrived it was some anime vampire thing? I have no idea but that’s why I hate buying from 3rd party sellers
I bought a phone once, they took the money and never sent the device.
Best yt channel ever

Your phone case is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dayummmmm🤣

You gotta read the description. They really be doing shit similar to this.
Where is Zack thooooo
This is why ebay and craigslist suck
Woooow, dats a damn shame.
man bought air for 500$ 😂
the music that was playing when he read what it said in the description got me depressed
My new favorite YouTuber
I bought a pc case for 50 dollars and got 2 fans ;/ didn't even get the full 5 fans
When that storm started I was no more good it came from out of nowhere  To me it represents his sadness that's why homie said he didn't pack it 😭😭😭😭
“Deflated ass brain”😭😭😭😭💀💀had me dying I almost spit out my cereal
check this one out my friend ordered a CD player and what she got instead was a pack batteries and the instructions to the CD player but no CD player🤔🤔🤔👀👀👀 lol
Baught a PS5. They only gave me the ps

Atleast they got the box

What is the song that plays during the twist?
Google.com

The possible slash fortuitously muddle because church independently love beside a majestic yarn. magenta, longing scallion
Did nobody else notice his retsuko phone case
why was there a box in the first place
Lol
This why you always check the reviews and description 😂
Bruh this box is like that lightning jar from k&p you should sell it to the government or something
Why would you spend $500 on shoes?
bruh mans got fresh air from the nike factory nice aggretsuko phone case btw
When he said Nike air 1000 I thought he was going to pull out a pair of cardboard shoes
ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ    ಠ◡ಠ
The importance of reading every details of the product before buying online.  I remember browsing through items in some online shopping app and saw this big thumbnail that focuses on nvidia rtx 3090, the price was unbelievably cheap like, less than $100 and I knew something is wrong, then I saw the description that says box of nvidia stickers...
Unpopular opinion: NO shoes are worth that much money.
A friend of mine bought an HDMI cable online. I didn't even know they made them that short.
That why I always shop on Amazon
This man said Nike “Air” ..😑
Omg they all have the same phone 😱
He gave that man about of air bro🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂
ayo your videos are awsome stay making videos ok
Damn he got such high quality air  Wonder why he's complaining
“Deflated ass brain” 😭😭
😆
This guy could be sending rain to Africa is he really felt like it
I bought a spirit Halloween Micheal Myers mask and they gave me some ripoff one
I liked the video right after that laugh at the begining
When you buy items from Third-Party sellers
I just wanna know the name of the song at the end when it was all sad vibes
it would be funny if the seller was wearing the shoes because he forgot to send them to lenarr
the air was in a nike tick formation gotta love the little details 1:00
Oldest trick in the book. My friend's dad bought him an original Xbox for christmas back in the day. When that was the hot item. But it said Microsoft Xbox box and in the description it simply said "Only the box". And he paid $180 which was the full price of a new Xbox back then. It was in 2002.
he got tthat air pack from bikini bottom king neptune  fr
I bought some security wifi cameras on amazon and it turned out to be a Chinese company that hacked my network and stole almost 1k out my bank account
"You good?" "No" *That was the most depressing no I've ever heard of in my life*
This is to dame funny
that FUCKING SONG IS HURTING MY SOUL HE GET PAID TO TRY OUT COUCHES
wish be doin people like this too.....it had a damn tablet on the picture, i read the description it said it had a tablet in it, and i ended spendin 50 on some damn earbuds
Bruh this nigga sent him a storm ⛈, and said “everything else is in there”. Then he’s going to ask for 4 1/2 stars ⭐️. 🤣
this guy is halarious
Damn $500 on a box of air...that's why I don't buy shit from eBay 🤦🏾‍♀💯😭🌬🌪🌧☔
POV: you bought a PS5 from off brand seller

😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
He place looks nice

Moral of the story, read the description before buying an items.
🤣🤣😆
i thought i was buying a XboxOne S but instead i got a box :|
*when my crush says ew to me when i looked at her* 3:24
Bruh I'll read the description from now on

Damnnnnnnnnn
A box that can cause a storm is probably worth more then 500 dollars.
I mean they are Nike air 1000. Of course you were gonna get air that's at 1000 speed in a Nike box

Every nigga that bought into the ps5 hype last year for $1000+ and ended up with a picture of the console printed on a sheet of construction paper
When I heard him say deflated ass brain it killed me 😂
Haa haa 😂...reading is fundamental 😂
Storm is metaphor for life
I ordered a pair of Jordan 1 Chicago’s and when I got my shoe there was only one shoe, but on the eBay picture there was two pairs of shoes and no where in the listing said that it’ll only come with 1 shoe
I think that storm cost more than the shoes anyway
😭😭😭😭
Great content but probably took a while to mop up that water afterwards 🥸
When the roughs are get rough u gotta tough
this is perfect for customers who dont read the description.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Deflated ass brain😂😂
Time to commit crimes my boy........
What’s the outro song?
The song when the rain comes on is called knowing by Michael Vignola
Lmfaoo
But whole time this nigga got weather in a  box
I can’t believe people can actually get away with this it’s sooooo stupid
It’s too true
Gotta jacket alright 🤣☺️🤣
You got a jacket? I got 3 sandbags when I ordered 2 Google WiFi routers. I literally got trash I had to throw out. Luckily Ebay was not happy either  and sent me a refund as soon as they got the picture.
Bruh this wasn't even funny. Instead it made me sooooo angry
ayo the aggretsuko phone caseee!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Brooooooo its a elemental portable box.
The whole thing is funny I love all of if don't know which one killed me tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
stoopid
I've learned my lesson. Always read the description. I've bought something that I thought was one thing, but it was something else. Always read the description.
Bro this is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while! I needed that laugh. Thanks 🙏🏽
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lenarr still got it
Premium air LOL
ye this happend to me
Damn reminds me people getting scam for a picture of the ps5
Lenar just keeps getting better
Bro I feel bad
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that who ever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
He ain't lying tho
Oh damn lmao!
From an angle, lanarr's hair looks like a virus with spikes
Come on bro, you got some premium air n storm in a Box!! I'd be happy to pay $500 for that.
EyE done ceen it all! 🤣🤣🤣  Very creative. Lol
I’m sorry this made me tear up Laughing, funniest Video I have ever seen on YouTube I mean that shit from my heart !!!!!
Omg when he read the description and I remembered the price he paid I am screaming on my toilet while taking a #2 right now
Lets take the opportunity to realize this man Lenarr paid a man 500 dollars to have a box that can manipulate and replicate the atmosphere itself in a small space without disturbing the fabric of time itself.. idk bro, I think you got a better deal 🤷🏾‍♂️
This is how Villains are made
"Deflated ass brain" lol 😂😂
Lenar reads the description: no refunds 😞  Other Lenar on the phone: I TOLD YOU TO READ THE DESCRIPTION NOW YOU LOOKING STUPID WITH NO SHOES MAYBE YOU NEEDED THAT AIR DEFLATED BRAIN  Other Lenar:😯  Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
What a gem 💎
When you see a sale that says it’s a photo of a PS5 but all the people didn’t read the fine print in the title and try’s to win the sale.. 👁👄👁
😂😭😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He didn't gey scammed, he just didn't fully read the disruption. That's on him cuz i always do. This wasn't not a scam
Why does it feels like a motivational vedio at the end😂😂

"Deflated Ass Brain"
Bruh I once tried buying a desk from staples online and they sent me a giant box with the desk literally snapped in half. I sent them pictures saying "wtf is this" and they tried telling me it was fine. If 1st party retailers do that kind of shit online, then there is no way in FUCK I am ordering something from a 3rd party retailer.
Me when I get the ps5 for $1000 and get the ps5 box and some rocks but forgot to read the description
When the first "dumbass" was yelled, that's when I started to laugh
The Nike Air Air Jordan's  (made 100% of air)  Now available only for 8,000 $
I order two pair Dumbbells in each box and all I got was two empty boxes with dumbbell pair logo
Daaaamn,this shit was sad tho! 😂 great job!
;not the 🌬💨😂😂😂😂
Dude said some imma get some towels 💀😭😭😭😭
I died when he said “DANGGG! You recording this?”
Get is sad how people can get away with this
Omg something similar happened to me 🤣🤣🤣 the title said “color changing contacts” what I got was some sequins and a note saying cut them in half and stick them to my eyelids and when I blink it will look like my eyes changed color. Like wtf.

Lol

Sound like this dude let a spirit in his house
Guarantee all of that rain is hiding his tears. Dude ordered a $500 box of quality air. Man I'll bet the 3rd party was wish.com. Same shit happened to me. When I was stationed in Germany, I ordered what I thought was a $30 Samsung laptop. The picture had the laptop with some green laptop brushes. So I ordered what I thought was 4 laptops. I ordered 1 for me, 1 for my wife and 1 each for my kids.. Man listen, when that shit finally arrived, I was happy as shit. I rushed home after work. When I got in the house and I quickly opened the box, it was 4 laptop brushes wrapped in plastic with brown paper in box. I was pissed. I looked at my order again, and there it was......Samsung laptop.....brushes. I wanted to slap my damn self. Instead, I grabbed my bottle of vodka and sat on my patio quietly.....pissed. Every since then I've said fuck wish.com. Even though I didn't read the description,  it's still fuck wish.com
i started to cry
That one paper towel square 😂
Deflated ass brain!!! 😂😂
Jesus loves you
My boy got the Nike Air 1000's with real features😂

As young don the sauce god says “Moral of the story always read the description”
felt
This happened to me technically with airbnb, I got a nice condo for two and it was huge so I assumed it was all good for me and my date and when we pulled up I said to the guy “we’re here” and he said we? This is only for one. And told me to call customer service to get a refund and customer service said they can only give refunds if he accepts it, and if course he denied that shit and I got fucked out of $200 and had to go to a holiday inn that night.   Still got laid tho.
Moral of the story is: Always read the description.
Not once since I been watching has this man NOT made me laugh my ass off hahahahahaha
He looked like roddy rich at the end 😂
That A I R tho.
😂😂 did that man durty
Swear I thought the air meant it was 'cold' not empty 😂😂😂

When’s the new geometry dash vid coming out?
This what happen when you buy a ps5 off insta
His friend knows his going through a storm full of pain rn
I can’t stop laughing!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This actually happened to me yesterday
If I could get a box that makes rain, I’ll gladly give him that five star rating⭐️
If you don’t get your item, you can always call your bank to file a dispute!
When he said  “Maybe you needed that air, deflated as brain 🧠,”  I felt that
I wish I could like this twice lmaoo😆😆😭
lmao last month i got scammed out of 1300CAD after buying from a third party seller. rip feels bad man...
Would of been perfect if it was “AIR” pods
Where are my shoes!!!!!!!!
I'd pay more than 500$ on a box with wind and rain inside. That's some next level shit right there.
This is the PS5 scenario all over again. Shame that nobody else can ever get away with a gold mine of a scam like that again. 😂
Lenarr: Record this, while I record you recording me, recording you. 😅
He said hune instead of hundred  Speak fail
Brooooooooo
Dude your videos are relateble af and I Love it❤️❤️❤️
“Deflated a$$ brain” 🤣
"You good?" "No" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funniest nigga ever😭
Wow i mean pissed bro
He didn't send him air he sent him the soosh(Nike logo)
I bet Lenarr ordered these Nike Air from the same Salesman that scammed Caleb with his "new phone" and the $700 subscription a month =D
my dad once ordered speakers and got gucci glasses instead
YEEEET
1:12 LMAOOO crying😭 3:12 I'm dead💀
It technically got them air's tho
That jacket was for that air lmao I'm so hurt rn
Funny thing about this is that in this case, eBay would STILL back the buyer in this case.  I sold something that said to check the description because of a flaw in the object I was selling.  They claimed it was damaged, even though I said it in the description.  eBay will side with the buyer 99% of the time. Almost no use selling on there lmao.
“deflated asss brainn” dat hurt🚫🧢
Love your content. Always make me laugh.
My man got premium air from the nike air factory and still complaining not realistic On top of that he got a storm
He really got Nike Air's
You my cousin dad family member his name is Sheen?
NEEDS to do Young Dolph talking to himself in the Trap intro
thats why you should read description before buying thing
What's crazy is, people legit did this with the PS5... They said you're only getting the box it came in and people bought it thinking they was getting the ps5
the shoes are like your dad nowhere to be seen
Stock X and don’t waist your time anywhere else.
Lmao as someone who just bought third party this was waaaaay to relatable 😂😂
Where’s Zac
Moral of story, read the description      Carefully
Nike Air 1000s? More like Nothing but Air 1000s😂I’m so not funny🥲
Can we take a moment to appreciate Lenarr #2's shirt tho?
"maybe you needed that" ( ꈨຶ ˙̫̮ ꈨຶ ) Real though someone tried to pull something like this on me, raise enough noise either your bank, the payment service or the listing site repay you but I'm pretty sure the seller doesn't eat that refund
He said deflated ass brain🤣
I look STUPITTHHHH  I didn't read the description   I LOOK STUPITTTTTTTT
I will still try to get my money back because they made it look Misleading and they where literally trying to scam
The retsuko phone case fire
😂😂
he could put a storm in the box But can he capture lightning in a bottle ?
That Aggretsuko phone case tho
That JANK is cold... Looool
I feel that cartoon air effect was from wind waker
At least he got a jacket
I just got a ps4 controller from a third party seller and the shits got a broken left stick
daaaayyyuum
It’s not a scam if it tells you directly what you’re getting. I’ve never done this but I think it’s fair as long as it makes it clear.
Did him dirty 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahahaaaaa!!!
Me: still laughing about mr. Doo doo man
It was pretty good air tho
F

Sad but true!

3:56 that's my friend Lamar u can be just like him if you don't red the da# description before you purchase

Saw some sh!t similar to this! Some one was selling a RTX 3070 on eBay and the price was at MSRP and I was like the f*ck wrong with this card cause everybody else was selling it for $900+ (USD). Read the description and it said "box only" and I was like they are gonna get somebody good with that bull sh!t who pays before reading the description!
The fact that his hair was actually moving when the wind was blowing is A plus attention to detail.
I almost bought some broken sh!t! I saw it said “(read description)” in Caps lock so I knew it was serious... Scrolled down and it said “... product doesn't work. Purchase for parts only!” bruh I was like thank goodness they said something cause I was surely thinking to buy it at first. I just couldn't figure out why they had it priced at close to half MSRP.
Lmao love how dude scams dude and still calls him a dumbass
The sad music 😂😂😂
“I’m about to go get some taco’s” 😭😭

GPU scalpers when their bots order a $2000 piece of paper with a picture of a 3090 on it.
KING JESUS CHRIST is returning. Time is short. Turn away from your sins and repent. JESUS is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He is the answer to a fulfilling life!:)

I once got supa fly jacket from a Asian designer store online, it was the largest men's size they sold, had to give it to my 10yo son who could barely fit it.
Some guy made thousands of dollars off a ps5 printed on a piece of paper for $500 each and people were po! Always read description when buying products online.
Trivia Question: In which film did father and son actors Will and Jaden Smith first appear together?
I know it's just a bit but if this ever happens to you then go ahead and file a claim with eBay. They'll usually side with you because listings like this are designed to trick you and eBay knows that.
Anybody know the instrumental he’s using towards the end ?
Deflated ass brain 🧠 🤣🤣🤣
lmao he said his brain deflated

When following the instructions is crucial...
I actually did this not long ago with hair wax. The image looked like it was a big container and it was decently cheap so I just bought it without reading the description. When it arrived I got this tiny jar. Went back to the products page to contact seller and turned out the title literally read “15mL”. DUMBASS
Deflated ass brain😂😂

Where the PS5 at?
You good?  No
The fact that the description literally said *”no REFUNDS”* 😂😂😂
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
The sad music with the rain gives me a Minecraft vibe
NEVER BUY FROM EBAY!!

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10  9.That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.

Jordin Sparks: “Tell me how i’m supposed to breathe with no air” Lenarr: “I got you, only 500 dollars”
Lenarr just sitting there with the open box storming on him is like a metaphor for when you just sit there trying to understand how you feel being scammed.

Fyi this skit is based on a true story. Last year someone sold a ps5 box in Amazon. People didn't read the description. Had they read it they would have noticed it was just an empty Ps5 box
I'm not even capping my dude look like roddy rich at 3:57
Oh man. Even your own friend feels so sorry for you that he had to get some towels to help clean you up.  lol.
I would kill someone for doing that to me, I don’t get why people pull that type of stuff on the internet to sell
He didn't get shoes but he got premium air
Wenarr
Everybody need a friend like black shirt in these situations

I swear I got scammed for a swimming pool and I didn't know that the website was fake so depressed about it because it was for my daughter birthday party

"Everything else in there, though ... you can give me 4 and a half stars out of five, I really appreciate it". That's only fair.
$500 for some quality Nike Factory air?! I’m in!
Moral of the story is, if it says to read the description then you better read the description or you might suffer the same fate as him...
You can see the anger slowly turn to sadness turbo quick 😂🤣
Aye bruh....you is pure comedy 😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣💯💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾

eBay sides with the buyer anyway so it ain’t a thing
Fornite storm 😂😂😂
This one is even better on second watch lmao
this is why read the description 😂
Had someone scam me out of a Series X for $500, except, they didn't do a good enough job. I got refunded immediately. (They tried to sell the receipt while giving 0 indication that it was the receipt they were selling)
Nike Air Jordan  box 🤣😂
“Based off a true story”
Bruh avatar sent him sum a i r 😎
It be like that
"U good?" "No" I felt that
It reminds me of that Spongebob episode where they carried air in a sack😭
I had the same experience with a GoPro Action camera. In the description it said that the box contains vouchers for action packed activities to bring your GoPro with you.   I am stupit
It’s the fact that someone got away with doing this exact same thing when the ps5 came out 😭😭
Notice how they all got the same phone cases...?
He got Air
If only that listing on facebook marketplace from kyle kas who goes to Arizona state university and has a mom who lectures there named erin kas, contained information that its not an iphone 11 but a deck of cards.. i’da felt really smarter after making the 455 dollar purchase.. silly kyle now how will i ever return this deck of cards smh

People never look at the description, people were buying ps5 boxes because ether were to dumb to look at the bio
to be honest though, why is there a picture of the real shoes when the real box is just really "Air" Smh
You know why they call it Wish? Because you're gonna wish you got what you ordered.
Hurt the soul 💀😭
I’m so dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's always the read the description

I ordered light up LED Nintendo switch controllers and got the parts to build it my damn self😂😭
Oof
Always read the description

This dude brain is different. He definitely thinks outside the shoebox
"You send me my money back or I'll have eBay do it" bruh this literally is how it goes on there lmao
How the heck did he make it rain like that
When u buy ps5 from 3rd party sellers
I once almost bought a star shaped locket on amazon. So glad I read the reviews... I almost bought an air freshener in an organza drawstring bag! I was shook and felt bad for the few people who admitted they bought it thinking they were getting a locket. Always read the description AND reviews if they are both posted.
Bruh!! Hilarious shit Man
Air from the mf Nike Factory i’m dead 🤣
bro i need that “rain in the box” help me go to sleep at night😌
🤣
Lmao
someone on eBay was sell the picture of the ps5 for thousand and it said it was just a picture and peoples still brought it and this prove peoples don't read the detail
Funny thing is that this happens fr fr

Lenarr sponsorin Wish now?!
Was looking for a new graphics card on eBay today, it really do be like that tho
i hear this instrumental  a lot anyone know the name?
is tht the iphone 12 he got cuz im starting to regret if i should buy it
Aye that air premium af tho
This was really funny. I laughed... a lot.
Definitely why eBay should be officially banned for eternity.
Sometimes this happens where sellers may mislead buyers. Recently there were cases where a scam where scammers were pretending to sell products for a few hundred bucks and only mailed the photo to the buyer. To get around ebay rules, they explain in details what they would mail to customers. But because how frequent this scam was occuring of tricking ppl into buying photos rather than actual product. Ebay judged this behavior as a scam and refunded customers. So if Lenar actually called ebay. Depending on the situation they may make arrangements for a refund to take place.
What is that sad song??
great video Jamal i mean Lemar i mean Lemur i mean
The rain killed me 😂👌🏿💀😔

Homie you bought that shit off Wish they misplacing the items that your supposed to get in the package
Noted: When ordering from 3rd parties always look in the description 👍🏾
When you thought you found a good deal for a ps5 on ebay but it’s just the Ps5 box🤪
You can tell it was skit when he got through to the seller instantly
...                                                   Oof.

People trying to get the ps5
Happend to me to when i order The PS5 one ebay for $1,000 it was just the box with a ps3 in it.
🌬😐
Got you bro
Mans ruined his cut for the vid
PLAYSTATION 5 (Read Description)  contains 5 playstation 1's. NOT the 5th playstation
"It comes with a storm in it". Had me dead🤣
Nice one 🤣
He got AIR instead of a AIR-FORCE😂😂😂
I never got scammed but I had my package deliver absurdly late. I order a PAIR of 30lb dumbbells around Thanksgiving and didn't receive them until the end of the year. I finally got it, but it turns out to only be 1 instead of a pair so I had to contact them, then wait a couple more weeks. After, I finally got it and it took around almost 2 months to get what I originally wanted. Best believe I'm never purchasing items from 3rd party sellers again.
Now here's how I would have got my refund. Because he didn't list the storm was a rainstorm, it messed up the air and the box that it came with so he got to give me a refund on that because that wasn't listed in the description
nil that case is hideous it was making me mad no cap fat ahh case
Honestly expected a ps5 to be in there lol
Hit em with that Ghost of Tsushima wind 💨💨
Bruh, I felt his pain.. and this ain't even real
😭😭😭how
Thoses FX are cold !
lenarr reminds me of  calebcity  but just with cursing in it.
Can we appreciate the editing god job
How it felt like buying a ps5 on eBay
He got the Airs for real!!
lol man this exactly why I never buy off ebay when I look up items. I never trust any of them bootleg fuck sellers even if they have good ratings, lol. I only order from store brand name places.
Gpu buyers right now be like

Don’t worry a lot of people feel the same way, when they bought the Xbox Series X & PS5 box/container 🤣😂🤣
I may be to young to understand but is third party sellers.
I think that’s still against eBay’s policy, so u should be able to get the money back
" You good? "  *" no. "*
"You can give me a 4 1/2 out of five stars I'll really appreciate it"
This has happened to me alot of times🤣
bro this upload is timed perfectly cuz I just got scammed on ebay and in the return process atm

I once ordered a new phone for my little bro on Banggood. But on the description it said refurbished meaning not new. The good thing is that it lasted 4 years. Unlike my my iPhone SE from 2014 🤣

You can still claim fraud because of the picture just saying even if they said read the description
Everybody's talking about how it was just "air" it's actually wind (:
Lol
No cap
People kill me with this on ebay. 💀🤣 I literally see people bidding on boxes for macs, consoles, and everything else! Hundreds of dollars for them to have wasted and NOT returned because they don’t want to read carefully.
Why do I wanna do this so bad...
Lenarr gets better every video.

Bro I’m howling
also r we just gonna ignore the fact that this man sent whole elements through mail. I mean yeah he got scammed but crap, if I were to get scammed it would be by the avatar himself.

this hits extra hard after the "street hawkers" sold out
Ayo I have the same lamp to 😌
When your early ;-;
That Aggretsuko phone case tho.
Lenarr you not slick i know what meme u was inspired by💀
Wouldn’t that picture in the eBay post be false advertising though? If you’re including the shoes in the picture, that’s fucked up to mislead someone like that.
On god bro they be trying to be sneaky gotta read it all😂😭
nahhh 😭😭😭😭
It's funny cause I got finessed like him last week. And also on eBay.
Dead ass that’s how I be 💯💯💯💯
Sony be like: ok so we're releasing the ps5  Me: lets go   Sony: sike bitch it's just a ps4 controller with a xbox case and a painted ps4 console
Weather box is cooler than some shoes
😂😂😂
People ordering the PS5 on Ebay:
Nigga i knew this shit was funny. I'm dying laughing over the thumbnail  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t know how the fuck you did that, but that shit was fireb
It truly do be like this lol when the price be looking iffy, that's when i notice the (box only! No ___ included!) and be like, y'all mad wrong for that shit lol
Reading and asking questions are  free!!😅😅  The amount of times I had people buy an item just for me to make sure they read the description and they didn't.
Well he did say he was gonna cry
This man is really getting rained on with a straight face
As soon as I saw the empty box and he called him I said "it was a listing for an empty box"  That shit said premium quality air from the Nike factory. Im DEAD
I felt this on a cooperate level
Tell me why he high-key looks like Roddy rich in the rain.
https://youtu.be/h3b4MESckRk

I like the fact that on his phone you can see he’s actually calling someone
They’re not scammers though

The wind has me flatlined
I mean, hey, you got your Nike Air 1000 and a free jacket? sounds like a steal to me
when he opened the empty box          *i felt that*
I mean, the seller ain't wrong. It clearly said on the item, "(READ DESCRIPTION!!)".

Can’t relate

According to the view, I'm 20,501st.

SAD PART IS...I DID THIS TO SOMEONE BEFORE...ON EBAY!!!! 😭😭😭
its the 808s for me bru
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Christ Jesus paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. How can you pay Him back? You can pay Him back through spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”. He offers you the free gift of eternal through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Christ Jesus is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Christ Jesus. Have a blessed day.

Goat did this to me. Finessed me out some La to Chicago 1s. The nigga for sure took his joints off his feet and switched them out with my pair. Honestly fuck this cancer shoe culture. Nike is profiting off color people and not actually supporting them.
