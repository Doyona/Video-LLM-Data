🤍💙💛....❤️💛❤️.....2025...... Estos orientales que cantan en ingles con una coreografía muy animada....que hace justicia al ritmo que tonifica la melodía....un conjunto de notas y letras que sin conocerse juntan una versión bonita.....aunque en el abecedario están todas juntas .....las letras digo......como el realizador de un juego divertido a modo de supervivencia musical. Parece que triunfo bastante en todas sus modalidades. Paulatina y claramente se compaginan en un meneo unísono y complejo que vacila.....imagino esos periódicos e informativos dando honor a un grupo tan visitado y visto a nivel mundial en tan pocos años,.....conciertos y escenarios abarrotados queriendo pasándolo bien. Que chachi, siempre te digo lo mismo, te imaginas ¿A € por like o visualización? Entonces si.......gran variedad de comentarios hablando del videoclip que tanto llama. En fin. Un desarrolle de esos que lucha en tus neuronas y pelea a modo de entendimiento, un modelo diferente comunicativo e interactivo de la situación que entiendes a tu manera. Está chachi para los transportistas y personas que trabajan a diario llevando y trayendo personas para que se motiven.😂 Total vacila.........desde y donde siempre Gran Canaria......un servidor. A.D.N.13
Can we make this reach Billion as well?
Jimin, you're cool. ❤😊

Their eyes and smiles are gorgeous they could have been movie actors or models if they wanted to. They are very lucky. We are lucky they chose to be Bangtan though. Which makes me happy. They make me feel like I am not weak for having anxiety. Which is powerful. I would love them if they were ugly. I think they seem like very nice people.

来年！BTS 活動再開して欲しい！ 早くCDの制作も作って欲しいよ！ライブ開催も楽しみ！
Me se todos los paso de jimin
🚨ARMYs, we need to vote for Jimin on Mn£t Plus in both categories to get that DAESANG (a reminder the last 6 yrs BTS won)! It’s better to not split the votes. Since jimin is leading let’s vote for him otherwise we will lose the award for another group  Please make sure you are voting with all of your devices everyday, and encourage friends and family to vote too! there's a tutorial video on my channel if you don't know how to vote

bravo suga

처음으로 방탄소년단을 알게 된 것은 dynamite였다. 과거의 앨범을 듣는 한, 원래의 스타일과는 크게 다른 노래였지만, 그래도 그 때, 나에게는, 아니 세계에는 「dynamite」가 필요했다. 그래서 당신이 낳은 곡이라고 생각한다.  어둠 속에서 확실히 당신들은 dynamite처럼 비추어 준, 그 때의 감동과 가슴의 고함을 잊지 않습니다.  그리고 방탄소년단 7인 전원 각각 다른 매력과 재능이 넘치는 멤버, 전원을 사랑합니다. 당신들을 알 수 있어서 좋았다. 정말 고마워. 앞으로도 계속 일곱 명, 행복해주세요. 당신의 노래는 계속 듣고 계속됩니다, 세기를 넘어. 사랑해요.
Como que ya pasaron 4 años.

Like Crazy has potential to become the first ever korean song to gain 1B on spotify in a single calendar year but we need a daily average of 2.8/3M streams!  Remember the song has almost zero playlistsing so add it x40 (20 silver + 20 pink cover) times to your playlists!!  #LikeCrazyTo1B 💪

২০২১ সালে এই গানটা আমি প্রথম শুনেছিলাম, আমার অনেক ভালো লেগেছিলো ।। আজ ৫ অক্টোবর ২০২৩ , এই গানটার শুনে nostalgic  হয়ে গেছি :')
No entiendo Inglés, ni coreano pero eso no es un obstáculo para poder  disfrutar de la música  de bts.

Todavía no me creo que está joyita ya tenga 3 años desde que fue lanzada, desde ese entonces en cada lugar se escuchaba de hecho no había lugar dónde no se escuchaba dynamite, valla que increíbles recuerdos.
노홍철をまねしちゃうBTSのメンバーのキュートさ。そう言うところかっこいいですね。応援してます♪
My favourite song, I'm still listings this song 2023. This song is so beautiful, cool and amazing!!! Thank you so much for beautiful song.  I LOVE BTS FOREVER 💜💜💜
view của dynamite đỉnh quá
Favorite song ❤
This version of dynamite is soooooo muchhhhhhh fun 😄 🎉💖💜🫶✨️
Lovee 🇺🇿💜
I love that version and miss this era
I just wish that this would have been the official MV. I would have gotten into their music much earlier than. It took me watching a whole bunch of Run (the show, not the song😂) to become their fan. I laughed the whole video. It's amazing. I just wish more people would watch this.  Just my opinion, though.
To 1000M Visualizations
Happy 3rd anniversary of Dynamite bside...💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜ARMYs let's hit it to 1 billion views...🎉💜🍀
I love both the official MV and this loose care-free one.
I like chat with BTS

BTS FOR EVER 💜
BRU SIGING IN FRONT OF MY SCHOOL IT WAS IMBARESING
Special Notice : Topic :- ( how we can stre@m properly.) 1. Make sure to turn off subtitle because vi3w will increase more strongly  2.Watch till end without forwarding  3. Don’t skip ads if It's long you can skip after 20 seconds 4. Don't delete YT history  5.Volume should be 50 plus  6. Don't listen in loop or continuely plzz. Cause YT doesn’t count vi3ws if you just repeat one video. So just watch two or three videos before repeating the same one.  7.MV quality should be high. ###Thanks for reading, army. Keep fighting! *-*
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
OMG, I have never seen this version of the MV before, it is so charming, just slightly off from the original with what looks like sort of out takes.
3 anos...💜 Esse ano foi incrível 2020... 💜 Onde surgiu Dynamite...💜 BTS marca história 💜 As músicas são maravilhosas! 💜 São coreanos de sucesso...!💜 #SOUARMY 💜
where am I in this 2-3 years? Today I get to know that dynamite (b - side) track MV also exist. I am such a fool.

Love how they are just goofing around and such a cool video came out of it💜

WOW awesome
IMMACULATE
Me topé con estos chicos hace un mes y no he parado de verlos son simpáticos, cariñosos, divertidos , guapísimos, muy profesionales, bailan super  bien los 7 son uno. Y cada uno de ellos aporta una  voz muy peculiar que unidos engrandecen el grupo, su personalidad y espontaneidad los hacen ser unicos nos les faltan nada, son perfectos. Tengo 66 años y he vivido muchas etapas musicales y estos chicos son únicos. Y a las fans ARMY le digo que los sigan apoyando y ahora más que nunca que tienen que hacer el SM en esos 2 años es cuando más necesitan el amor incondicional de sus fans.❤❤🥰🥰🫰🫰

AMO ESTA ERA
‏الكيبوبرز طول عمرهم يحسبون ان الk في kpop معناها كوريا ما يدرون معناها kim namjoon
Amo este MV, no me cansa ver como se están riendo todo  el video
Jungkook Namjoon J-Hope Jimin Tae Suga They all have special and wonderful clips except Jin why why didn't he get his clip like the rest of the members This is considered as a kind of discrimination and negligence against him in the end he appears in a clip with several delays
♥♥♥🔥방탄소년단에게 투표하세요, 그들은 당연히 받을 자격이 있습니다 .

Es tan divertido este video,i love u BTS
Jeon Jungkook. I want to start by talking about your musicality in this sense, more specifically, your voice. You have the most healing, soothing, calming, and passionate voice I have heard in my life.  You have such a breathy, gorgeous vocal tone that ignites every single word that you sing.  It is one action to speak, but sometimes what you sing says more to us than what mere words could ever. Your voice is as gentle and comforting as a lullaby, but as powerful and soulful as a person’s spirit. You can bring tears to those who aren’t sensitive, and put a spring in the step of those who feel lifeless. You’re the only person who I know encompasses so much talent and possibility in one voice. You tell stories, give advice, and release pain just by singing for us. Just as your singing serves as an entire mind and body experience for the listener, your dancing is equally as imperative as a component for your exquisite performances. You have all of the skills and marks of a phenomenal dancer, but when you dance your body absorbs the music. Your body moves and becomes one with the rhythm, and watching you fall into the music to let yourself go makes us feel liberated. Whether it be contemporary, hip-hop, or any other style, your body naturally adapts to the atmosphere and every little morsel of composition. Only you have the blood in your veins that pumps through it the essence of dance; of which no amount of training or practice could be put in to acquire. Needless to say, you have reached new heights in the world as well as within yourself musically. You’ve quite clearly taken the globe by storm as you have emerged as one of the most iconic artists in this generation; and furthermore, in this world. You’ve revolutionized the sound and meaning of music; as well as performance etiquette. There will literally never be another artist to grace this Earth like you again, so we will live through and spread the history that you have made with each passing day. Thank you for your legacy in music and for discovering more about it each time you associate with it. As much as I love your musicality, I love your personality all the same. After years of being in this line of work, you’ve only matured, but never lost who you are at your core. You are astonishingly humble and I always marvel at this especially given how admirable of a person that you are. Most importantly, you are the greatest friend a person could ask for and I know that your members love this about you more than anybody else. You are so intriguing in that your members have always wanted to protect you, yet they want to learn from you and look up to you all the same. The past several years of knowing them, no doubt have been the greatest and you are at the heart of the memories that make them who they are. You give them youth, energy, strength, determination, and belief in themselves.  Where the other boys may see insecurities and imperfections in themselves, all you have ever seen is beauty and perfection. They wouldn’t know their worth if you hadn’t spent the past years of their lives raising them and instilling in them the values to live a satisfied and rewarding life. Army just want to thank you for filling every single second of your members’ lives since you’ve met with the greatest memories and stories worth telling. Thank you for helping them grow and evolve, all while ensuring that they listen to their heart. Thank for changing their lives forever, and becoming a brother that will remain a part of their soul even in death. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you to become the irreplaceable light that you represent in this world. I have no doubt that you family is one of your biggest, if not the one reason that you are able to be where you are today. I know that they helped you and allowed you to reach your dream. I’ve heard you thank them and consider them so many times along your journey and I know that you keep them with you everywhere that you go. You will get lost and might feel like you can’t ever find your way back, but your family will always be your guidance. There is no situation too severe that they could not save you from and help you through. They support you more than anybody else in this world. You honor them will all that you do and attest to the way they raise you with the life you lead. Don’t ever think you disappoint them because you are their greatest love and dream in this life. They will always love you and be proud of you more than anybody else in this world. As ARMY, we keep them in our hearts as you do and strive to be as gentle and impactful to others as they are. Jungkook, I was unaware of the depth that could exist in a relationship between fans and idols until you came into my life. So much has changed in your life since you started, and I realize that one of the constants that has never changed, only gotten stronger, is ARMY and our love for you. You don’t let your walls come down entirely until you are with us or your members, and we get to see you as realistically as possible without meeting you in person. We live our day to day lives working hard because we know that you are somewhere several miles away doing the same for us. We’ve seen you go through a lot and though it is unbearable to see you down at all, we are so lucky that you trust us enough to see you in these conditions. You work so hard for us; pushing your body and mind past its limit just to make us happy and we don’t deserve you straining yourself for just one performance. Not to make you feel overwhelmed, but you have literally saved the lives of hundreds, maybe even thousands of ARMY who have wanted to give up on themselves. You give us all the strength, love, and faith that we need to live the best life, even if it means giving some of your own basic needs to us. I want to thank you for making our lives so worthy and making us individually feel like we are on top of the world. No matter when they meet you, it feels like they’ve had years of the greatest and most emotional memories that will be treasured and honored in the most sensitive part of our hearts. Thank you for helping the millions of ARMY fulfill their destiny in life and for giving them a place of bliss to return to that lies within you.  We could never forget that the best years of our lives will be defined by you. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally and professionally. We’ve been trusted enough to see some of what you gone through, whether it be physically, mentally, or in any other way. Like aforementioned, even if you are in the slightest bit unhappy, it is unbearable and overwhelming to see.  We’ve already seen too much, but it breaks our hearts to know that we might not even know the half of it. You’ve been working for so long, and essentially gave up your youth for all of us. I can’t imagine how hard it might have been on you at times. Given this, all I can say on behalf of all of your loved ones is that we are so beyond proud of you for making it past all of your struggles. I know that you’ve found true happiness and have felt alive doing what you do, and we are just so thankful that you are able to overcome what ails you. When the time comes, you are able to remain optimistic and turn your pain into productivity.  Every time, you come out on the other side so much more mature and experienced. We all look up to you in this sense because you see every difficult moment as a time to learn and grow. We learn from you in this way, and we know that no matter what you face in the future, you will be able to face it with confidence. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and that you get accomplish all that you desire to today.  I hope that your ARMY serve as a vacation for you today and allow you to just breathe in the life that surrounds you. I hope you are able to look at us, see the people we’ve become, and recognize all of the countless hearts you’ve mended. I hope you can take this day to see all that you have done for this world in over eight years. I wish that those around you also help you to realize what a cherished spirit and soul that you are. I hope you get to relax today, and that this goes down as one of the best days you've ever had! Those who love you most will help you make only the best memories that you can always look back on! You deserve all of the blessings, success, and happiness that you have; and I know that there’s only more to come! Please have fun and spend every second doing what you love! Thank you so much for sacrificing so much just to make BTS and so many of your solo projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fatigue, doubt, confusion, isolation, concern, hardship, loneliness, and so much more just to bring us the slightest bit of content at all.  Of course I want you to work until you are satisfied with yourself, but I don’t want you to stress because you want it to be perfect for us. You are already perfect to us and beautiful inside and out. It feels like living in a dream with you and our lives are now not complete without you in it. You are our whole world and heart, and no matter what happens in the future or where you go, you have our undying, unwavering, unconditional love. You are our inspiration in this life where everything is scary and uncertain, and I can’t thank you enough for blessing all of us by sacrificing so much of your time. We can’t wait to see where you go in the future. We will by your side for infinity and support you always. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Jeon Jungkook, and we adore you so much!!

방탄소년단의 노래 중에 가장 좋아하는 노래입니다. 약간 레트로 분위기도 나면서 뮤직비디오의 감성과 배경이 너무 마음에 드는 것 같아요. 특히 색감이 너무 제 취향이라 제일 흥미롭게 봤던 뮤직비디오 중에 하나입니다. 방탄소년단 분들의 모든 활동을 항상 응원하겠습니다. 방탄소년단 파이팅!
진짜 귀엽다

Hello there, old friend! There was a time I used to str3am this version often. I even counted the number of str3ams (I stopped at #93). Those were the days. Anyway, this B-side version rocks. (Video #27)  The Philippines, 25 Jul 2022; 9:30 am (196,894,152 views)

방탄소년단이 부른 "다이너마이트"라는 곡은 2020년 하반기에 세계의 흐름을 주도시켜 K-POP을 세계에 알린 최고의 대표곡으로 평가받고 있습니다. 이 노래는 현재 남자프로배구 서울 우리카드 우리WON 프로배구단의 윙스파이커로 활약하고 있는 배구스타 송희채 선수의 응원가로 사용되어 오늘에 이르고 있습니다.
I stanned so many communities fandoms and kpop here i am from my journey, i gotta say this is the first community ive been in that i bought so many things got so many friends and heard so many quotes from

Me emociona mucho saber que BTS alcanzaron tantos logros y sueños y se dieron a conocer más  por esta canción tan bella , que les abrió la puerta a nuevos horizontes en su carrera y me trae hermosos recuerdos esta canción y está era ,todo era tan brillante y hermoso como dynamite y lo sigue siendo y siempre lo será pero ,está era fue única y nunca la voy a olvidar ,fue tan bello y único que BTS hayan hecho esta canción para army en aquellos tiempos que nadie en el mundo lo quiere recordar cuando el mundo estaba lleno de muertes ,tristeza y dolor por lo que estábamos pasando la humanidad por el COVID,BTS nos dieron consuelo como siempre en sus canciones a,army que como todos la estábamos pasando muy mal,pero como siempre BTS a nuestro lado ,dándonos está hermosa canción para que nos sintamos mejor y se los agradezco muchísimo 💜✨
1 year later: this song is still vibrant  5 years later: this song is still vibrant  10 years later: this song is still vigourous  100 years later: this song proves that it will never age.

This song is totally LIT 🔥
canta hermoso y bailan los felicito     bts son mis reys😍💜👑👑👑👑👑👑👑💋💋💋
la prueba que los bitis son grandes y constan de un fandom enorme ES ESTE MV, como pueden tener esa cantidad de vist4s (que a mi parecer es muy baja) y tener casi 8M de lik3s y todavia PARA UN MV BSIDE???? WTFF,,,, otros actos coreanos ni en su vida llegan a esa cantidad de me gustas pero ahí los ves con 400M de vi3ws pero ¡ups! 2.9M de lik3s,, salaverga q paso ahí industria kapoperaa??"#$"% y es aqui donde un fantasma pregunta y que vrg tiene eso que ver conmigo? contigo nada pero es una muestra que si el kapop no se viraliza una vez mas (asi como cuando bts saco su soty aKA DNA en 2017) toda la gente detrás de ello morirá a causa deEE *redoble de tambores* HAMBREEE menos los bitis clarOoo porq ellos si constan de un fandom leal y no gente fantasma que te olvida por una nueva moda,,,, yoo?? la armi menos intensa y ant! del kpoc SÍ POR,,, en fin si leen esto str34m THAT THAT
Ok, isso é muito divertido, aaaaaaa o jeito que vocês me fazem feliz não tem explicação, EU AMO MUITO VOCÊS MENINOS!!!!!!!♡:(
Who else still miss this iconic BigHit intro ??

to be brutally honest, I kinda prefer this as the primary MV for the song, it fits the spirit better IMO.
I am not an army, not a fan of BTS, nor I have a crush on its members, still whenever I hear it's song it always lights me up. 😄😄😄
Let's give this B-side 200M views FIGHTING! <3

DYNAMITE IS A CERTIFIED HIT! MV HITTING 1.4B, CHOREOGRAPHY 200M, THIS B-SIDE TO 200M, DANCE PRACTICES 100M!

Simplemente los amo!! No hay más palabras más que Amor para ellos.
If BTS have released only a single MV of any of their songs then definitely there would be more likes, views and comments like BLACKPINK never released anything twice so they gain more views everytime, it clearly proves that BTS don't care about views or likes they just want to make us happy by anyhow 💜 BTW I don't hate BLACKPINK, I like them, I was just expressing me taking BP example
Excellent Video, Dynamite is one of My Favorite Songs keep it up
😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕

Ok the end was really funny and I can tell why • V wasn’t paying attention so he forgot to do it but when JK hit him in a playful manner is sooo cute and Dunny  • V does it a bit faster (haha)  • V in pride of himself after doing it in sync lol 😂

나는 당신과 함께하고 존경하며 당신의 작업을 참조로 삼는 것을 매우 자랑스럽게 생각합니다. 당신은 단순한 우상이 아니라 삶의 전체 구성을 대표합니다. 왜냐하면 당신의 예술은 팬과 아이돌의 이러한 관계는 마음을 통해 형성된 매우 강한 정서적 수준에 도달합니다. 맨날 옆에 있는듯. 당신은 내 인생에서 필수입니다. 💜

!!!Attention Army!!!   Our str3@ms on YouTube are getting very low. Pls go stream on YouTube and other platforms at least twice a day.  Here are the most important things to pay special attention to while str3@ming:  Turn off autoplay  Make sure the video quality is above 480p  Volume must be 50% or more  Don't skip/pause/double tap to move ten seconds forward + DON'T spam in the comments (no em0jis)  After you streamed one mv, don't str3@m the same mv AGAIN. Watch 2-3 other mv's in between to make your view count.  You can also str3@m with your earphones plugged in if it is too loud for you.   Copy and spread!!!
Daily reminder to stream BST, FIRE, DOPE mv along with BUTTER & PTD daily..these mvs are close to become next 1B mvs. *FIRE and DOPE on 1theK!!!* Add these in your daily streaming list. Push BST more pls!!!
*Small str3@ming playlist* My Universe Permission To Dance Butter DNA Blood, Sweat& Tears  Save Me No Danger
ARMY NEVER LIST TO NOT DO  - Do not loop - don't str3@m one mv on repeat, watch 3-4 in between (for example videos from bangtan TV or other mv's) - don't put volume under 50%
We really need to increase the vi3ws of BTS MV'S, we are doing better Spotify but are low on YouTube :(and that's embarrassing for the biggest fandom in the world. *normalize str3@ming everyday if you can*
Do you guys realize that we can make *DYNAMITE* become the *most vi3wed mv by a Korean group* by September or October of *2022 THIS YEAR* but it won't bc Armies aren't str3@ming in YouTube like we used to do before...?? Pls normalize str3@ming every day if you can
*Small str3@ming playlist* *STAY ALIVE!!!* My Universe Permission To Dance Butter Run Blood, Sweat& Tears  Save Me
*BTS ON SPOTIFY* Only two artists in history have 100+ songs with over 100M str3@ms on Spotify and BTS is only 10+ songs away from having 100 songs with 100M str3@ms!!! (1. Drake, 2. Bad Bunny, 3. BTS) Many Armies made str3@ming playlists for that, go on Spotify and start str3@ming!!!

💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Definitivamente esta canción fué, es, y será la más icónica de TODOS LOS TIEMPOS, nunca pasará de moda, es que la energía que trasmite es imposible de explicar, todos coincidirán conmigo al decir que Bangtan y la onda 70's -80's - 90's es la mejor combinación!!!  En fin, BTS PAVED THE WAY FOR ALL. AMAMOS A LOS POP TITANS, PRÍNCIPES DEL POP, A LOS  ÚNICOS PAVED THE WAY, EL GRUPO MÁS COMPLETO Y TALENTOSO, A LOS WORLD DOMINATION, ESTE COMENTARIO SERÍA ETERNO SI NOMBRO TODOS SUS TÍTULOS ASÍ QUE SOLO DIRÉ: REYES DE LA INDUSTRIA MUSICAL, EXACTO, HABLO DE BTS!💜
dios la prepa se puso un poco complicada ya tenia que no oía la música de BTS como se debe. Me hace recordar cuando me volvía super loca con cada come back de ellos no se si ya por el tiempo que los staneo ya no siento ese instinto de querer romper récords me he alejado de tanto
2:35 best part....jimin's expression 😍

If anyone is a army here reply me:-  I💜 you
Oww their happiness make us happy <333
2:01 this frame is sooo cute!!!!
Congratulations to all of the BTS, including the Grammy Award nominations and the AMA Grand Prize.  RM "This is a miracle. We don’t think this result is natural.”  I said, "Even if it's not natural, it's a miracle, but it's not a coincidence but a miraculous fact, so please be more proud and dignified and confident."
Quiero conocerlos ustedes son mi ídolo desde que tengo los 3 años pero es que viven en China y yo vivo en República Dominicana

This is inevitable by accident. I saw the music and dance of BTS and was fascinated by it
তোদের জামা কাপড় ছিড়ে দেবো
Idk why but in terms of music video I really prefer this version over original, it’s way better
정국이 방 안 고쳤어 엉망이야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
なにこのバージョン…かわゆい…尊い…… てか最初からずーっとおちゃらけてふざけ倒しておいて、最後の大サビになった途端、キメッキメで踊るのズルない？は？？？
This is not a song... It's history...
Dynamite is the best BTS song ever .. Who agrees with me??

ARMY me he dado cuenta que en momento en el que JUNGKOK se levantó de la cama póngalo en cámara lenta y van a ver qué pasó una sombra  por la ventana  del lado derecho de su celular hay una como ventanita para un cuarto y ahí pasa una sombra muy rápido por eso póngalo en cámara lenta veanlo  ver varias veces iba y ahí van a notar que por ahí pasa esa sombra por si no lo logran 😨😨😧☹️☹️☹️☹️
أحب هذا الاصدار أكثر من الأمفي الأصلي(:
Son tan divertidos
bts let s go

Let's vote BTS (best song of summer) on MTV's instagram!!!
You ever notice that no matter what color Jimin's eyes are they have this little twinkle.  Sweet Jimin.  And, V/Taehyung never disappoints me with all that charm - especially at the end.  Too funny. I think I like B side better.
Omg😍😍😍
Me encanta todos sus temas
go to fake love

Yes we do
BTS💜ARMY, congratulations on winning 1st place on Billboard Hot 100.

Evde Tavuk Döner Malzemeler 1 kilo tavuk göğsü ve kemiksiz but karışımı 2 yemek kaşığı yoğurt Yarım çay bardağı sıvı yağ 1 adet soğan(rendeleyip sadece suyu kullanılacak) 1 tatlı kaşığı domates ya da biber salçası 1 çay kaşığı kekik 1 çay kaşığı karabiber 1 çay kaşığı pul biber 1 çay kaşığı kırmızı toz biber 1 tatlı kaşığı tuz  Hazırlanışı Bir kaba yoğurt, soğan suyu, salça, sıvı yağ ve bütün baharatları koyup iyice karıştırıyoruz. Tavukları enlemesine olacak şekilde iri parçalara bölüp doğruyoruz. Sosun içerisine alıp heryerlerine gelecek şekilde sosa buladıktan sonra üzerini streç filmle kapatıp en az 3 saat(hatta bir gece beklese çok daha lezzetli olur.)bekletiyoruz. Dinlenen ve sosunu iyice çeken tavukları yağlı kağıt üzerine üst üst alıp koyuyoruz. Yağlı kağıt ile birlikte rulo yapıp şekil veriyoruz. Daha sonrada tekrar streç filmle hava almaması için sıkıca sarıyoruz. Bu şekilde derin dondurucuya kaldırıyoruz. Dönerimizi pişireceğiniz zaman dondurucudan çıkarıp biraz beklettikten sonra ince dilimler halinde kesiyoruz. Tavaya bir tatlı kaşığı kadar tereyağ ekleyip arkalı önlü dönerlerimizi kızartıp pişiriyoruz. Pişen dönerleri tavanın kenarına alıp biraz daha kızartırken tavada açılan yere tekrar döner koyup pişirebilirsiniz.
Patates Mantısı Malzemeler 7 tane patates 500 gram süzme yoğurt 1 diş sarımsak 1 yemek kaşığı tereyağı 1 tatlı kaşığı tuz Yarımşar çay kaşığı Karabiber Kırmızı toz biber Nane Kırmızı pul biber  Hazırlanışı Patatesleri soyup küp küp kesin yıkayıp tuzlu suda haşlayın. Suyunu süzüp sıcak sıcak servis tabağına alın. Üzerine sarımsaklı süzme yoğurt dökün. Tereyağı toz biber pul biberi kızartıp üzerine dökün. Nane ekleyerek sıcak sıcak afiyetle yiyin.
CARACA JA FAZ UM ANO QUE ESSA MÚSICA FOI LANÇADA, PARECE QUE FOI ONTEM!!!

BTS💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
yoo too much coool bro
POV : 2O Years later, You are successful and independent and scrolling through youtube and you suddenly found this..You run for your headphones put them on close your eyes and start playing this As the song starts tears fills your eyes... You remember all of that stupid and adorable fangirling stuff you did.. That scream whenever you saw bts posters  That savage fighting with haters That unbearable wait of their vlive and that unmeasurable pain when you missed it That desperate try to get a reply on weverse Those daydreams of marrying your bias That patient wait of Tuesday for a run bts episode That blushing while reading the ffs That passionate try of learning Korean Those stupid ideas of sneaking into bts concert without money That uplift of mood whenver you heard about them That silly fights with your army friend for having a same bias Those songs Those episodes Those memories Those emotions Those days It all clicks together Then there are memes bringing you flashbacks of their crackheadness and us adoring it You really miss it all But the memories will forever stay with you and will be probably the best ones of your life  You go to your room open the drawer in which you have all your bts photographs albums and memories treasured You look at them with tears still in your eyes  and say it was the best life anyone could ever live Thankyou BTS for saving me thankyou for bringing the best of me out
I love you bts 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜 Army forever 🔮 🔮 🔮 🔮 🔮 🔮 🔮 🔮
The fact that Jin has more screen time in B side MV than official MV 🙂

Did you know that BTS gains an average of 53,086 followers every day on Spotify? Weekly, they gain 321,919 followers, according to CHARTMASTERS. They are followed by BILLIE ELLISH, ARIANA GRANDE, OLIVIA RODRIGO, ED SHEERAN, EMINEM, and JUSTIN BIEBER. Imagine that, JB is only 7th in this global list? What an amazing achievement for BTS!  (In case you are wondering, BLACKPINK is in 15th place with 21,571 daily and 155,379 weekly new followers.)  Philippines, 2 Aug 2021; 12:01pm

이상다팩트니까 알아서하길 바래 즐거운 축제ㅣ가 되길 바래 이상이야 그리구 아까 글안올린 층 은 싹 가
난 팩트만을 얘기하지 월요일에는 내가 그층 알아서 뽑을 테니 하던거 냅독ㆍ 빨리가길 바래 오늘 너희는 짤렸어
나머지는 입아파 알아서들하기 바래 특히 BTS 는 만은걸 해줬지 BTS는 오늘  행운이 만을걸로 예상돼
결론은 우리대한민국을 기회의 땅 아름다운나라로 생각하는 분들이 만아서 투자하는 분들이 만을꺼라 생각해  그래서 오늘 우리는 어떻게 해야 할까
우리모든구카가 하나가되는날 그때는정의가 살아 숨쉬는 나라를꿈꾸기 위 해 함께 하나가 되어 같이 가기로 했지
그러기에 우리는우선 대한민국을 강국으로 만들어야해  그래서 우리가  약자를ㅇ이끌어주고 강자는함께싸우기로했지
자 그러기에 우리는 어떠케 해야할까고민했지 그러나 행복에 나라를 꿈쿠며 가자 지구로 함께 가기를 다 원했어
행복하고사랑이넘치며 전쟁없는나라 누구나 평등하며약자를 이끌어주고강자는기아난민과UN단체와 내전중에있지만 정우 롭게 맞서 싸우는 의료진과함께 우리모두  하나되는날을기원했어
각  나라의 만은 분들이 오셨지
어제 만은 굉고주와 부동산이나 빌딩 의료 사업을사려는각계각층의 사람들을 만났어 돈이 만치  그래서 우리는 온세상사랑이 넘치고 희망이넘치며 평화롭고 행복한 나라를 만들기 위해전쟁없는 나라 평화롭고 행뵈한 나라 온 세상이 하나가되기위해 만났어
이회사 없어도돼
난 구글도 있어
난 천명 없어도더니까
내 글 올려
관념이야 반대하는 애들은 필요없 우리의 모토랑 안맞으니까 필요없어
짤린애들은 짐싸  이런 오너의 과념을 안올린다이거지
올려
다짤리기전에
빨리 올려
주위에서  모하는거지
빠리 올려
빨 리 솔려

ATENCION ARMY. Es importante hacer ST 3AM MASIVO a BUTTER y PERMISSION TO DANCE intercalando con idol, fake love y mic drop para l@s que no sepan les digo: hay un récord que no hemos podido romper y es el de Adele de 1B de vistas en 87 días, la idea es romper este récord con BUTTER y nos quedan aproximadamente 42 días para lograrlo, hay que intercambiarlos con las canciones mencionadas, es importante que lleguen al Billón ya que están muy cerca. Por favor sigamos con el str3am. Por favor copien y peguen esto en las canciones de BTS que puedan, para que más ARMY'S se enteren, nosotros podemos
yeaaaahhhh

I always watch the song from my ad but sometimes I don't now I love you guys' new music video!
I love this version
I love you v and junk kook
In
Good
Ne    Aq
Note: I commented 3 days ago that butter needs to be the fastest to reach 1 billion. Well I have changed the plans and now I will focus on 'Permission to Dance'. I have calculated and noticed that most of the ARMYs do not stre3am after the premiere just like 'Butter'. If all the 3.9 Million ARMYs that saw the premiere would have streamed Butter 50 times the views would have been almost 190 Million. So if there are more than 4 Million concurrent viewers on the premiere of 'Permission to Dance' and they all str3am it 50 times in the first 24 hours the views would reach more than 200 Million views. It would really brake the internet. Copy and paste this on every MV and show of the episodes.
I love you J-hope
The time I saw this song in tv (MTV Hits chanel) was the time i started liking them but, this song (the original MV)gave me the wrong exprection for V. I thought V was a boring type untill now that i know that he is not boring at aaaalllll!!!!!! I purple u BTS!" You nice, keep going!"
I love very much dynamic lyric song and  thaer skills guidelines.
I love you  armi😚🥰

New title: BTS highkey vibin to their music while shooting the M/V. Edit: I DIDNT NOTICE THIS BUT JUNGKOOK REALLY DID TELL US TO SANITIZE AT 2:40 KSJDBHSGVJSVB Edit: I saw some peeps sayin "*highkey" so Imma just do that Edit: Sorry for another edit- but like- A lot of people were thankfully correcting me. The part in which it seems like Jungkook is putting on hand sanitizer is not what is happening! In fact what is happening is he is recreating this little part: https://youtu.be/lXoKb929EVg

I really don't like k-pop but this song was fire....
REMINDER ARMY: It is not only important that we break the butter records and reach 400M. there is another record that we must break yes or yes , We must make STR34M MASSIVE. In case you don't know, there is a record that we have not been able to break and it is not from BTS, the fastest MV to reach the BILLION of views has it ADELE-HELLO (87 days), according to my calculations we have 2 months and 24 days to achieve 1B and breaking adele's recod, so you know, the records are not only 24 hrs and in this fandom there is nothing that cannot be done.

ATENCIÓN ARMY:  Es importante hacer S T R 3 4 M MASIVO a BUTTER intercalandolo con Idol, Fake Love y Mic Drop, porque para l@s que depronto no sepan les digo:  Hay un record que no hemos podido romper y es el de Adele de 1b de vistas en 87 días, la idea es romper ese record con BUTTER y nos quedan aproximadamente 52 días para lograrlo,  y hay que intercalarlo con las canciones que dije porque también es importante que lleguen al billón ya que estan muy cerca.   Por favor sigamos haciendo S T R 3 4 M y COPIEN Y PEGUEN ESTO EN LAS CANCIONES DE BTS QUE PUEDAN PARA QUE MÁS ARMYS LO SEPAN, gracias y nosotr@s podemos ARMY :)

To my fellow Army. Pls take time to read. 💜  Stream BUTTER road to 1B in youtube. We still have 1month left to break the record of the most fastest MV to reach 1B in just 87 days.   Update: Pls when you stream butter kindly  alternate it to their other songs.   We still need to boost other songs also.  For example.  We have "Fakelove" that needs 46M view to reach 1 B 30M for "Micdrop" 53M for "Idol"   We are one on this Fight. Pls. Share this to others. Borahae💜💜💜
Just tm he:jungkok😘😘

RECORDATORIO ARMY: No solo es importante que rompamos los records de butter y llegar a 400M. ay otro récord que debemos romper si o si, Debemos hacer STR34M MASIVO. Por si no lo saben hay un récord q no hemos podido romper y no es de BTS, el MV más rápido en llegar al BILLON de views lo tiene ADELE-HELLO (87 días), según mis cálculos tenemos 2 meses y 24 días para lograr 1B y romper el recod de adele, así que ya saben, los récords no sólo son de 24 hrs y en este fandom no hay nada que no se pueda hacer.

I'm in b-side
I love this song. The boys were able to practice the song and pronunciation a lot because it was very accurate and skillful, even if English was not their first language. So all my respects are theirs. The song is very beautiful and has a very good vibe anyway. And the members have a divine voice, I love them all. And Jimin's voice.....beautiful, lovely and glamorous. I love Him and his voice. And all the members are beautiful. I love Them, the song, and everything BTS has to do with it. I love BTS.
Watching it for the 1064789th time 🤯still can't get over it.. Bts members are magician or what 🤯😶💜💜💜💜💜bts saranghae🥰🥰🥰

Army's can someone help me with homework! Does anyone have a current opinion on minimum wage? Like in why raising minimum wage sometimes be bad? Or in which businesses can be affected the most, or if there should be a  federal minimum  wage why or why not ? Don't be shy help me with my homework :D it will be really appreciated if you can write me a paragraph or two I'm supposed to do a essay about this but i can't write one :((

Guys, common! This is song on three notes. That's not music at all. Bts are artists, famous persons but not more. Grammy for them??? This is a joke😂😂😂This is a song for teengirls...Soon, everyone will forget them👎👎👎

hank you very much guys ❤😭 thank you for giving me that happiness that no one else could give me, you taught me many good things that I have been able to find. If you had not appeared God knows what would have happened to me, I suffered many things such as loneliness, lies, but your song had a lot to explain to me: D. They explained things to me that I couldn't understand how hard it was to grow up. Namjoon: thank you very much for letting me know who I am that my physique no matter how important is what you carry inside your heart :). Jin: Thank you for letting me understand that I am still a divo  7w7 no matter how I am, thank you very much. Yoongi: thank you for teaching me to be stronger every day: ') for telling me "you can't" when you said that I felt weak but that gave me more strength to say "you can" thank you 😥❤. Hoseok: Thank you my Little Sun for making me understand that if I could that I could overcome everything that I lived that you made me believe in me, thank you very much. Jimin: my little Mochi thank you for saying "no matter what they told you you knew you could" thank you very much. Taehyung: Just with you I wanted to talk, okay, thank you very much, TaTa, I love you very much as well as each member, thank you because you made me know no matter what my face or face was like, you let me know that I had to accept how it was because God brought me like that and that each of us looked very beautiful in our own way. Jungkook: JK you almost gave me a heart attack when your collapse happened 😥😨 but you were very very strong thanks because the same thing almost happened to me I was short of breath I felt weak but I was strong and I reminded you thank you. BTS: THANK YOU BANGTANTV ❤✨
I LOVE BTS!!!!!!!

Wow! Guess time flies so fast....I feel like it was just released yesterday and now...we're on a Butter era?

1:41 can Jimin never stop falling 🤦‍♀️
Why can’t this literally be the official mv. Like literally burden of choreography on there heads 😑

FALTAN MENOS DE 400M PARA QUE DYNAMITE SEA EL MV MAS VISTO DE UN ACTO COREANO, PORFAVOR HAGAN STR34M O VEANLO UNA VEZ POR DÍA SI O SI. INTERCALEN CON BUTTER Y LOS REMIX'S. INTERCALEN CON MIC DROP, FAKE LOVE E IDOL QUE ESTÁN POR LLEGAR A 1B. INTERCALEN CON DNA Y BOY WITH LUV PARA QUE LLEGUEN A 1.3B!!

태형은 당신을 사랑합니다
Is my bias is jungkook
A quien más pasá que cuando escuchan DIAMANTE critan Llo siempre crito
UwU BTS
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
So cute
Tem que ser a todos os dias eu recebe meu PIS e ketchup da Heinz após o celular dele e advogados dói muito com vc na reunião do trabalho e
yo en el 2021 escuchando esta musica que recuerdos 😥😥😥😥😥
vean el mv de butter 2-5 o más veces al día, no estamos haciendo buenos números. Bueno, si estamos haciendo buenos números. Pero, si queremos hacer los 400m más rápido que dynamite, vamos muy lentos, los números solo están cayendo cada vez más.
BTS YEAHH
str3am butter mv 2-5 or even more times a day, we are not doing well here on youtube. I mean, we are. But, if we want to do the 400m in less time than dynamite we should get good numbers and we are just decreasing.
This version is like a hotter version of butter they are just doing what they want and they look so happy
Yoongi was so cute in this one! 💜
Knpe lagu bts mkin lma jdi lgu english🥲🥲
Plim
I'll never understand the popularity
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Cause I I Im in the stars tonight  So watch me bring the fire N set the night alight
mi vida los amo bts a morir 😀
Los amo son muy adorables :3
Jimin is so cute. Can’t spin without falling or be serious for five seconds <3
Lovely
I know you're here because you've watched butter's MV

Amo a bts
⚠️*PLEASE READ IT DON'T IGNORE*⚠️     English: STREAM NO MORE DREAM FOR BTS  We have to make it 1B Know BTS 8 Anniversary is coming up soon so We have to make it you know Once BTS said that their First MV never Hits that much but all their MV's are the Masterpieces that others can never be compared. So let's show others that we are the best Fandom ever Fighting ARMY. 💜   Korean: 방탄 소년단을위한 더 이상 꿈이 아니야  방탄 소년단이 첫 번째 뮤직 비디오가 그다지 히트 한 적이 없다고 말했지만, 그들의 모든 뮤직 비디오는 남들과 비교할 수없는 명작이라고 말하면 1B 알겠습니다. 그래서 우리가 ARMY와 싸우는 최고의 팬덤임을 다른 사람들에게 보여 줍시다. 💜   Spanish: TRANSMITIR NO MÁS SUEÑOS PARA BTS   Tenemos que hacerlo 1B. Saber que el 8º aniversario de BTS se acerca pronto, así que tenemos que hacerlo saber. Una vez que BTS dijo que su primer MV nunca llegó tanto, pero todos sus MV son las obras maestras que otros nunca pueden comparar. Así que demostremos a los demás que somos el mejor fandom que ha luchado contra ARMY. 💜
amo mucho este b side ><
🧨🔥🔥
Osea ya la cancion es hermosa,y mostrar la cancion con este video es lindo,sigamos con el apoyo a todas las canciones de los chicos:) ;)

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Butter was called “a pure, swaggering dance-pop celebration in the retro vein of Bruno Mars, with layers of Jam and Lewis-style synths.” The group’s leader RM said it was “very energetic and very summery,” with a “dynamic performance.”

Who's here after butter being 150M
They're just being themselves. Seeing them having so fun I feel like a proud mom. Although I'm just 16. These boys always make my day a lot better. I'm just too thankful to them for everything. Staying hundreds of kms away from us, they still find a way to make us happy. I'm so honoured to live in a time where these boys exist.

Mấy bạn cày views cho Butter nhớ giữ gìn sức khỏe những bạn hay ngủ sớm thì đừng vượt qua đồng hồ thời giờ của mình nhớ là giữ gìn sức khỏe và ăn uống điều độ nhé nếu tối bạn không cày đc thì để sáng có thể cày đc đừng cố vượt qua đồng hồ thời gian của mik nha các ARMY   Brothers who plow views for Bo mv, remember to take care of your health.  Those of you who often go to bed early, do not exceed the hour, remember to take care of your health and eat in moderation.  If you can't plow at night, you can plow in the morning.  Please don't try to waste your time, ARMYs - -  sorry if my english is wrong because i'm not good at english

2:22 jimin give up on them  Like totally😂😂
나는 쇼와 컴백을 요구하지 않고 새로운 투어와 말을 요구하지 않습니다.  노래와 트랙은 나에게 충분하고 겨울 관은 나에게 충분합니다.  수백만의 손을 들고 우리가 죽 이길 바라지 않아 .. 난 당신이 쉬길 바라며 정국은 무대에서 떨어지지 않는다.  슈가가 혼자가되는 것을 막기 위해, 태형이를 더 크게 웃게하기 위해서.  수천 명의 정호석, 김석진, 랩몬이 좋아합니다.  지민이가 노래를 듣고 울지 않도록, 그의 부드러운 목소리가 사랑하도록 ... 팬덤이 그의 사랑으로 불안과 어둠으로부터 그들을 보호 할 수 있도록.💜
I don't ask for shows and comebacks, I don't ask for new tours and words.  Songs and tracks are enough for me, winter coffins are enough for me.  I don't want us to kill With Millions of hands raised .. I want you to rest, And Jeongguk doesn't fall offstage.  To keep Suga from being alone, To make Taehyung laugh louder.  To be liked by thousands of many Jung Hoseok, Kim Seokjin and Rap Mon.  So that Jimin does not cry after the songs, So that his tender voice loves ... So that the fandom protects them from anxiety and darkness with his love.💜

Dynamite
SOS ARMYs! The new single of BTS, an English summer anthem 'Butter' comes on this Friday, May 21 at 00:00 EST/13:00 KST  You can find the teaser already here -> (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOMxU9f1FBU  Don't forget to like the teaser once you watched it!  You can pre-save/pre-add the song on Spotify and Apple music, or if you are a US/PR army you can even pre-order the digital single - or a physical copy of it -> (https://)www.bts-butter.com/  The new song is going to be performed for the first time at this years BBMAs this Sunday on May23 where they are also nominated for several awards. For one of them it depends on our votes if they win it. It is very important to participate in the voting while you can especially since as always, other kpop fandoms joined together to vote against us. This time however even western fans joined them. Let's do our best and vote on our boys as much as we can. Let's make this night even more memorable by winning them the Top Social Award for another year as they deserve, and let's make this comeback even more historical than any other comeback before by breaking our own records. Our first 24 hour views goal is 105 Million views. Definitely doable with the huge growth of our fandom, Dynamite had 101,1 Million views back then! Tune in to the premier on Bangtantv youtube channel half an hour before the MV drops(on May 21 at 00:00 EST/13:00 KST), like the video during the premier and once it ends don't go anywhere, you will be automatically redirected to HYBE LABEL's youtube channel to the new MV! Don't forget: don't ever loop, don't put the song or MV on repeat on any str3aming platform, no matter how much you like the song! Use playlists with the exception on youtube, on youtube str3am manually, watch other BTS videos in between such as Dynamite MV or the audio version of Butter which will be uploaded on Bangtantv youtube channel once the MV drops. On Spotify, Apple Music etc use playlists and switch them about every hour, interact with them, and NEVER put the song or the playlist on repeat or your str3am are going to be filtered! Avoid bot behaviour as much as you can. To avoid your str3ams getting filtered use premium accounts on all str3aming platform. You don't have to pay for them at all just get a free premium trial, activate it and cancel them before they end. I'm going to leave you links to free trials below, use them^^ Another fun additional info in case you don't know: McDonalds is also promoting the new single this time. For that matter there is going to be a BTS Menu available at McDonalds in almost 50 countries all over the world starting from May 27 (May 26 in the US). Please check your local McDonalds for more information to see if the BTS menu will be available in your country! :)  I'm also leaving you how to vote on BTS for the BBMAs, we still have a few days. You can vote both on website and social media. 10 votes/voting platform/account/day. If you wanna vote more than that a day you can, you just need to use another account, be it twitter or facebook.  How to vote:  For website vote go here -> (https://)www.billboard.com/p/bbmasvote/  To vote on twitter tweet something using the hashtag #BBMAsTopSocial and tag @BTS_twt (RTs are counted, too)  Every vote matters and is important!  And as promised here are some free premium trials for you, just click on the links and activate them on all platform you use to make sure your str3am wont't be filtered ->  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  Apple Music: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D  Let's make this comeback even bigger and legendary than any other before and make our boys happy the way they always make us happy!  Teamwork makes the dream work!  Happy comeback season fam :)

Army ayúdenme a difundir esto: Los chicos en varias entrevistas dijeron que su primera canción No More Dream no lo consideraban un hit, ayudemos a que  esta canción llegue a los 300M antes de la  fecha de su debut. Por favor difundan .  (copien y peguen yo hice lo mismo)

Army, I need your attention!!!. So an army suggested the idea to make bangtan's anniversary more special, they suggested that just like I purple you let's give bangtan I rainbow you. A rainbow has seven colours and if any colour is missing we will feel sad, the same is for bangtan if one is missing we feel sad. Please spread this to other army just like #ipurpleyou let give bangtan #irainbowyou as a gift for there 8th anniversary. We have less time, let us work hard to spread this.

I liked B - side better then the official
💖💖😂💜💜
😘😘😘😍
B-side is with shoot errors, wich is even repeated in the case of the donut, but wich is also lovely of course. I'm crazy of that song and it's wonderfull other versions, such as the christmas version, the cumbia version and the Michael Jackson versions. I wish i was able to make such a WORLD HIT !  ( Big hit Entertainment ... )
Let's make this 150M v1ew

Bts seni çoook seviyorummm
I love it this is song BTS army is member is voice in cute 🥰 🥰🥰
So armys. I have an idea which is very good and we can make it. So basically, we all know that Coldplay is the first group with 4 songs with 1b vi@ws and blackpink the second (and the first kpop group) and I was thinking that we can make bts be the first group with 6 songs with 1b vi@ws. Why 6? Because, we already have dna, boy with luv and dynamite with 1b and The other 3 are idol, fake love and mic drop which are over 900M. So armys let's make this. Maybe for their anniversary or until July.  So armys pls stre@m this songs, mostly idol, fake love and mic drop  Copy this and share it on your platforms (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube etc)
This isnt Dynamite B Side mv, its Dynamite Crackhead Version
The way I vibe to songs has drastically changed ever since I started stanning BTS lol

Whilst COVID-19 spreading~~ 2:34 Jimin denied handshake. 2:40 JK demonstrated usage of Hand sanitizer. Meanwhile Indian Politicians: Oh Rallies Rallies Yeah!! That too without maintaining COVID-19 protocols.. Not even giving a damn to COVID-19, like what the heck is even that? Where people especially students like me be suffering for nothing.😔😔 . . . To people, please don't attack me illogically, I'm a proud Indian🇮🇳🇮🇳 spitting the facts about the nasty political scenarios going on here. I'm neither defying my country nor I'm defaming her.

ARMY, please vote for BTS in Top Social Artist in BBMA's starting May 10th.  They deserve this 5th year of winning that.  For the past year, they are consistently indeed the TOP SOCIAL ARTIST, who always communicates and engages with fans in so many ways they could, accompanied by the global success of MOTS 7, BE  as Billboard 200 #1 albums, and Dynamite and Life Goes On taking the top spot on the Hot 100.   Our boys deserve this win. L.O.V.E.
Para las armys que todavia no saben que cada vez que comentan con emojis bajan las vistas al video  entonces si ya leeron esto a partir de ahora no coloquen emojis y para las que saben digan a las armys que ya no pongan emojis

Just passing the message: So here’s the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make “NO MORE DREAM” hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought their debut was not a bop, and didn’t want to look back at it. If we ARMYS get it to 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let’s make their debut mv hit 1B. Let’s do it ARMYS, You know we can. Share this as much as you can on every platform and in various languages. Thank You. FIGHTING!!!
Thought this was a boy band . So why can I hear a girl
2:32 Ay pero que HERMOSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!   😍

Chicas, tenemos un problema los bangtan dijeron que no consideran que no more dream sea un hit, así que ayudemos a que esa idea cambie y hagamos que el mv llegue a los 300 millones de vistas antes de su aniversario 💜

Столько Энтони Юлая нет даже в его видео))
Esta bonita la música y me gusta
Army ayúdenme a difundir esto:  Los chicos en varias entrevistas dijeron que su primera canción No More Dream no la consideraban un hit, ayudemos a que esta canción llegue a los 300M antes de la fecha de su debut. Por favor difundan. [COPIADO]
Hazme otra y qué es 🤩🤩
bet locals would think this as the original mv
you know what YouTube actually recommended this to me when 2021.
I LOVE YOU BTS
Realmente amo esta canción, pero es un poco frustrante que la traducción la hicieran literal y no le dieran sentido, además de que las faltas de ortografía que tiene no dejan una buena impresión. Hizo falta el trabajo de un verdadero traductor en lugar de un traductor automático. Sin embargo, es solo una pequeñez al lado del video que es lo que realmente importa.
😍😍😍😍😍😍

whos here after the new tiny tan animation 😍
me:how about watching this MV+the official MV in loop for hourst straight? also me:offc
*Me encanta que se hayan divertido al hacer Dynamite🤗*
!!Attention Army!! BTS are the fastest kpop group to hit 1B by their song Dynamite(7 mouths).Let's make them the fastest kpop act to hit 2B, we have time to break PSY (Gangam style)'s record, it's better to hit 2B at the end of this year but it must hit 2B before April 2022 so that BTS will be the fastest kpop act to hit 2B !!  Also Str3@m "Life goes on" "film out"  And at the end of this years "Mic drop" "fake love" "Idol" & "BS&T" Must hit 1B. we can do it just fight for it Army we're powerful enough! Str3@m No more dream as hard as you can before BTS' 8th anniversary
omggg why have i been able to be alive without watching this? i can’t believe myself
The tiny tan-ized V not kicking is so adorable 😍💜

EVERYONE! The original MV may have reached 1 billion views, but this has more Seokjin, Yoongi, and Hoseok, so shouldn't we focus on giving this 1B too?
I'm here after TinyTAN 💜
Who else is here from Tiny Tan?
An Arabic growth and you understand something from the song, but in any case, it is very sweet. I translated it and heard it, and reduced the translation. I answered a question. Hi, your channel is wrong with the prayers.ا If someone wanted to comment on my comment, write, but in Arabic, because I didn't think anything of them

the part that Jin was walking to the door when suga called him is so cooooool
This is the thing they do naughty and cute😂😘
I Love bangtan💜
Why does this have less views than the Choreography version.. Don't get me wrong. It's just that this version is the BTS-side version (the first being the ARMY-side version).  I mean.. I hope we can give this more views that it deserves, alongside the ARMY-side version.  BTS and ARMY together.. BTS-side and ARMY-side :) Borahae!
Suga and Rm english pronuntiation is good
Keep streaming my 💜💜💜💜💜

This is basically bloopers

Alguien más viene después del bangtan bomb?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-iAidoLfEU
1:54 That’s a complicated scenario Jimin : just coming like an angel to army’s lives Taehyung : spinning his $1400 dollar gucci vest like it’s nothing ( that’s like my whole life savings... xD)(he called me poor xD) Jin : opening a sliding door with face and failing dance? (Idk what to call that dance) RM: trying not to be crackheads like others and doing some cool moves (he failed) Hobi: what to do when a snakeuuuu comes out of nowhere? Suga: no , m not doing this shi.... bighit pays me for this  Jungkook : what the hell is going on here.... should I remind them, I am the Maknae? Hyungs, yall are making me embarrassed....
Watch 1:54 - 1:55 in  .25x speed. And see no one but jimin. (Just try, yall wont regret, I promise) A rare footage of jimin the angel.

89th time to stream AND comment on this MV. The Video Call versions are a delight to see...like this video!
B-side is made for army🥺
Jungkook’s ding dong is not same
I wonder how many discs namjoon actually broke filming this bside mv
After seeing bangtan bomb and knowing all the effort V and hobi put into that little self choreography, and seeing a few little thrusts and that's it, bless them
Después de ver el bomb apenas me doy cuenta que no estaban cordinados 😅
Hi! BTS.. uhm do you remember the girl group The Ark (5 members) that you guys reacted to their dance practice of Boyz in Luv cover.. could you please recruit them under your company? that group is very a promising group.. I just wish they could have another chance to achieve their dream and hope to re-debut them again as a whole group..
Min 1:44 hahahah the yoongi's step 😂😆🤩💜
2:40 las manos de jungkook

I love you the best singer in the world  💜
2:29 all are suprised becoz Suga was dancing energetically lol😂😂
I love J-Hope's enthusiasm over Suga's dancing at 2:30. It's priceless. <3
am i the only one that thinks that this video could be perfect for a video clip? its not like i dont like the official, i love the official, but it could be really awesome if the used this video for video clip

2:35  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8FQKUSJEexMFlN6mtw9V3Q The moment these Bangtan boys magically unleashed my shy voice and creativity to do a cover of Dynamite with a TWIST! I was shocked I was able to add my own little rap lines, lyrics, new melodies and AD LIBS specially towards the end of this bop song! I'm surprised how much these boys can inspire an ordinary girl like me even from miles and miles away.
Love you BTS 😗
Amo, me encanta, jajajss
Popular Opinion: Everyone agrees that J-Hope is not a Human. He's an angel
Que arte
rm Suga love❤️❤️
Siempre jimin asi
Estos llegan a entrar a una prision se los comen vivos😂
my freind made fun of me becuase I liked bts and said they're Asian

The icon in fortnite
Whenever I need a ‘pick-me-up’ I always find myself watching this video because it never fails to make me smile!
I haven't been with this group since debut but it feels like I have. I love them so much. They grew so much, in terms of talent and as a person. I'm really proud of them and I'm also very proud to be an ARMY. Their music brings me happiness and they themselves bring me joy. Finding this group has got to be one of the best things in my life.
son grandiosos los chicos

Army we made it I love you guys💜💜💜
Army ayúdenme a difundir esto:   Los chicos, en varias entrevistas, dijeron que su primera canción "No More Dream" no la consideran un hit. Ayudemos a que esta canción llegue a los 300M antes del próximo aniversario de la fecha de su debut...
pobre de mi jimin al caerse
Please stream SHADOW to 100 M, ARMY! Borahae!

months later and i still like this version more than the official one................
Sus risas, sus canciones, sus momentos, sus voces, hacen mi día un poco mejor :")
Son unas personas tan humildes, no entiendo cómo existen personas que les llegan a desear la muerte, ojalá el karma no les llegue tan fuerte
Que lindos, se divierten, ríen, juegan, son una familia, una verdadera familia, eso es a lo que llaman una verdadera amistad

Hey guys can you please help us ( directioners) Please take time to read this One direction 11 year anniversary is coming on 23 July but we are still left with some  projects 1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever,gotta be you , little things, etc, have hundreds of millions of views, still not what they deserve. We have decided to stream their songs on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe you can help us play some of their songs on youtube  Spotify, ITunes, Amazon music etc. If you can help the group of people who sold FNB stadium within a minute that would be great  2) This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this with your support The second project is to stream drag me down, which you can see in so close to 1 billion views, but story of my life is not so we will love if you guys stream story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. Both of the bands respect each other so we should also respect each other and help each other that would be great if you will help us please  thanks
O Jk é tudo pra mim!
É muita perfeição véi...
Kookies little jumps at the beginning! I just love how he is himself

Popular Opinion: Everyone agrees that ARMY is The luckiest FANDOM Ever.
Fact: this is not a mv this is Bangtan playing with each other nd being cute.
BlackPink have more views than BTS.  and Many other Musicians have more views than BTS. 130 million views in this MV is so weak. Is it fake that Dynamite is the No.1 song on BillBoard? BTS is not Popular?????
Dynaannn
amo mucho este video dios

Lets gt to 10 billion views on his every video if like this comment smash that cheese lueaze like button
So here's the thing, our 8th bts anniversary goal is to make "NO MORE DREAM" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always that their debut was not a bop and didn't want to look back at it. If we armys, hit it to 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now too lets make thair debut mv 1B Lets do it armys. I know we can. Share this as much as you can in every platform and in various languages

PLEASE READ THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT This is just a small calculation as to how we can get max views. There are about 46.4M subscribers to bangtan tv and No More Dream has 187M views(As of March 19 2021). So I'm assuming that these are the fans that have youtube. In an other google search result i found that BTS has 136.4M fans. So this calculation is based on the people on youtube. We have 85 days (Again as of March 19 2021) till our anniversary. Let's just assume that out of the 46.4M about 6M people didn't get the memo to stream or are student ARMYs who have exams and don't want to get their eyebrows shaved off by Joon plus its easier to calculate with the numbers rounded off😅😅.We have 40M left. Even if 1 ARMY watches No More Dream MV twice a day we get 80M views in a day and in 85 days that's 6B and 800M i repeat SIX BILLION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION views . Ig the reason that's not happening is bcos some ARMYs are focused on Dynamite,and that's not wrong either.The rate at which Dynamite's views are increasing is about 3M in 12 hours however i did notice that after the scammys the views increased a bit faster. As of today Dynamite has 936M views. If the views keep increasing by 3M views a day then the ARMYs streaming Dynamite will reach 1B in another 21 days(April 9 2021 approximately). And that means from that day we will have 64 days to our anniversary. So that'll probably mean that the ARMYs streaming Dynamite rn would be back to No More Dream hopefully. And that'll increase our manpower. The rate at which No More Dream MV's views are increasing is roughly 1M a day- yesterday i.e March 18 2021 the views went from 186M to 187M- and yes ik that's really less😭😭. Anyhow if all ARMYs all stream this together with the increased manpower at 1 ARMY=1 view then we get 40M views a day and in 64 days thats 2B and 560M views. This calculation sounds crazy but i went over it like 10 times with a calculator and googled the number of 0s in millions and billions.....yeah that's the amount of trust i have in my math skills but i hope this enlightened everyone and share this as much as possible and if there is smn wrong with the calculation let me know.  And here are some streaming tips that I gathered 1. Watch the vid from the beginning to the very last second and apparently the 30 sec thing isn't true 2. Don't press replay or rewind after the video is over  3. Don't cheat by opening various incognito tabs, ur views will be deleted 4. Make sure that the volume in youtube is above 50% but your laptop volume can be less or even muted if u are busy 5. Watch other videos in between.Yes this sounds counterproductive but this actually makes sure that youtube doesn't count your view as a spam and delete it so u can alternate with Dynamite,Life Goes On,On...basically any other vid. 6. Like i mentioned don't press the replay button instead wait till u get that option and then close the tab,open it again and then play it or better yet search for No More Dream and then play it 7. Don't increase the playback speed it has to be in Normal  My comment somehow got deleted thats why i've posted it again  Borahae ARMYs💜💜💜💜💜

3:25 in this scene who is the person V imitated. Can anyone tell me pls
Still irritates me as a Jin-biased how whoever directed this MV thought Jin doesn't deserve his own solo set and put most of his cuts on the B-side.  Maybe next time, use Seokjin more and then they might win a Grammy. They were noticed by the KMA because of Seokjin. Jin is their secret weapon. Don't keep him a secret forever.

So here's the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make "NO MORE DREAM" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that their debut was not a bop and didn't want to look back at it. If we armys, hit it to 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debut mv 1B Let's do it armys. I know we can . Share this as much as you can on every platform and in various languages.
Dynamite to 1B
los amo bts
They are kings
POV: Dynamite is the BTS others know, dynamite B-side is the BTS armys know.
#PEACE

I love B side because it shows more of Jin. He barely got screen time on the main mv 🙁
Popular Opinion: BTS didn't lose GRAMMY but GRAMMY lost BTS...

LOS AMOOOOOOO        BTS
PLEASE READ THIS,ITS A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE:😨👇👇👇⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️🔴🔴 -Guys as you know bts was nominated in grammys but did not win the award... and there's a video that showed bts prepared grammys cake early and all the haters were saying"bts was so overconfident and look at them now"what i say is dont listen to them. Bts is talented and they worked so hard to get to the place they are rn. As all the army knows bts's 8th anniversary is coming up and they always say that their first song 'no more dreams' is not a hit so let's take it to 1B views to surprise them and as a thank u gift for all their dedication and love ,also for making us laugh and teaching us how to love ourselves. Pleaseeeee army show them that we're still here and that we'll never leave their side. I know this is hard but we can do it,compared to all the things we did for them this can also be done. We all can show do this right,right army?share this message and let's all do this together before their anniversary.. let's all give bts is this gift. ARMY FOREVER!! 💜

Also jimin falling to the ground after that one spin still gets me 😂😂😂💜

amo muito vcs ❤️😍 é o meu sonho com vcs
ARMY
BTS
I definitely prefer the b-side over the official Dynamite MV. It’s so much fun! And Jin gets to shine in this one! And everyone fawns over a Yoongi; rightfully so cause he makes a basket backwards with one arm.
Не перестану наверное это слушать))
Those who disliked dynamite maybe it's because they don't know how to shine with a little funk and soul.
a reminder that shining through the city with a little funk and soul is a lifestyle and not a phase so no matter what, remember you're a diamond born to shine.
BTS los amo          ♥️
My eyes= readings comments  My ears= listening song My hand = scrolling down My mouth = singing song  I am very busy person 😅

Que maravilloso y alegre se siente intentar cantar Dynamite 🔥 mientras veo el vídeo con los bebés 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜✨ cantando y bailando siempre uno, army cuando los escucha intenta cantar con ellos con todas sus canciones aah. También uno quisiera seguir el ritmo en el rap pero no más no sale solo puedes una pequeña parte pero uno hay bien emocionada, emocionado siguiendo intentando cantar sus canciones. Seguimos reproduciendo Dynamite 🔥 porque nos encanta y como con todas sus demás canciones de los bebés seguimos escuchandolos dándoles amor.

#LightUpBTS
OK so guys there's a project on BTS 8th anniversary we have to make BTS debut song "NO MORE DREAM" hit 1b it sounds hard but we armys can together do it and we have to do it because BTS always thought their debut song was never a Bob (a hit) and they don't want to look back at it so let's prove them and let them know they were Kings that time as well... FIGHITING!!! TO DO THIS YOU HAVE ONLY ONE THING WHENEVER YOU TAKE YOUR PHONE STREAM 'NO MORE DREAM' ONCE AND BEFORE KEEPING IT AWAY YOU HAVE TO STREAM IT ONE MORE TIME THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. (LETS GET IT!!)
화려한
STREAM DYNAMITE!!!!!!! BORAHAE

Popular opinion: everyone agrees that BTS doesn't need Grammy's, but Grammy's needs BTS
you are read this coment so you are  streming     .............i love you ...........
So here’s the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make “NO MORE DREAM” hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought their debut was not a bop, and didn’t want to look back at it. If we ARMYS get it to 1B, they will realize that they were kings before and now too. Let’s make their debut mv hit 1B. Let’s do it ARMYS, I know we can. Share this as much as you can on every platform and in various languages.
Just tae being himself throughout
Son los mejor y Army se los merese soy fan de bts

Son muy ermosos
Suga performing in Grammy is more than a prize
Bts♡army
Is time for us to train ourselves to be a chart bully :)
Dynamite's level doesn't need the grammys this kind of third class award ╮(╯-╰")╭
Some people's worth are beyond these mere awards... Grammy can't decide BTS's worth. It's so insignificant .
el pasito de baile de Suga en 2:28 me dio 100 años de vida

THE MOST COMMENTED MV IN HISTORY??? THATS FCKN COOL.  I CANT BELIEVE THAT THESE GYUS ARE THE SAME BANGTAN SONYEONDANS FROM 2013. OUR BOYS HAVE GROWN INTO THE KINGS OF MUSIC INDUSTRY!   САМЫЙ КОММЕНТИРУЕМЫЙ КЛИП В ИСТОРИИ? ЧЕРТОВСКИ КРУТО. НЕ МОГУ ПОВЕРИТЬ В ТО, ЧТО ЭТО ТЕ ЖЕ САМЫЕ БАНТАН СОНЕНДАН ИЗ 2013. НАШИ РЕБЯТА ВЫРОСЛИ И СТАЛИ КОРОЛЯМИ ВСЕЙ МУЗЫКАЛЬНОЙ ИНДУСТРИИ!   ANYWAYS, ARMY, HELLOOOO.  WHERE ARE U FROM??  大家好！ARMY, 你们那国人？ 我 6个月前学习汉语。haha, sorry for my mistakes.

This is not the first time i watch this but i can't stop smiling.
Let the difficulties be set, we will make the floor again ... We are BTS, we will not give up so easily.

I love this song ❤️
Grammys could have lent itself some credibility by awarding the Grammy to BTS.
Cute
How many fucking versions of this music video are there 😭
Haiii wkwkwkw
CMON ARMYS I BELIVE IN YALL LETS GET DYNAMITE TO 1BILL.
STREAM DYNAMITE
Takes away deppression😁
Being absurdly positive about this shtty situation, this pain can help us evolve as a fandom cause many of the new armys are just so sure that BTS will win or chart number 1 that they rest easy. It has never been that way. We have always been a fandom that does its best for BTS so they will be untouchable because when we say BTS only has ARMYs, no matter how much it hurts, it's the reality.
Popular opinion: Everyone agrees that BTS don’t need grammy’s But Grammy’s need BTS
GRAMY´S utilizaron a BTS de esa forma ! no se vale, no se vale! #LighltUpBTS
BTS no PERDIO, GRAMMY´S PERDIO a BTS, BTS son los verdaderos ganadores #LighltUpBTS
1B to go... Let's go ARMY
They are the literally diamond
STREAM STREAM STREAM BTS VAMOS A DARLE A LOS GRAMMY DONDE MAS LES DUELE JAJAJA APOYEMOS A LOS CHICOS VAMOOOS ARMY !!!!!  KIM NAMJOON   KIM SEOKJIN   MIN YOONGI  JUNG HOSEOK   PARK JIMIN   KIM TAEHYUNG   JEON JUNGKOOK  BTS BTS BTS !!!!
We can do this army's! Keep streaming! Dynamite!!
Please don't watch Grammy performance when Grammy posts it , watch when bangtantv posts it
Los Grammys es caca, utilizaron a los chicos para generar rankins ya que saben que ARMY es una familia muy grande.

джин солнце я просто люблю тебя
какие же потрясные аутфиты
то как чимин флиртует с камерой до мурашек
арми, мы молодцы т.т
прекрасная работа
я слушала этот трек на повторе неделю, пока стримила и еще ни разу не переключала его на спотифае, потому что трек не надоедает
боже минус динамита в том что в нем нет минусов боже
динамит реально трек на все века
драгоценные бтс заслужили лучшего обращения к себе
проявим любовь к богине динамит с новой силой, словно это камбэк
смотрим динамит все релизы и оставляем много комментариев
Grammy desgraçado Qm concorda da like🤡

The 63rd Grammy Awards scored 8.8 million viewers Sunday on CBS, the smallest audience on record for the annual telecast, continuing the ratings tailspin for TV trophy shows.  and I am guessing is would have been much less without ARMY!

يز ارمي  كترو المشاهدات والتعليقات واللايكات  وخلينا نهجم ونحطم الرقم القياسييي وبليييز بدون ايموجي ليت كوووووووو ♡♡♡♡
INDIANS HAVE WON GRAMMYS. HENCE GRAMMYS ARE NOT RACISTS OR XENOPHOBICS.. INDIAN MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS LIKE PANDIT RAVI SHANKAR, NORAH JONES AND A.R. RAHMAN HAVE WON MANY GRAMMY AWARDS. HENCE JUST BECAUSE BTS DIDN'T WIN, IT DOESN'T MEAN GRAMMY AWARDS ARE RACISTS.
Los grammys se humillan y cagan solos sin BTS no hubieran tenido la audiencia que tuvieron, cómo va a ganar "rain on me" nmms ya va para el año y ni a 300M a llegado JAJAJA (no estoy rebajando solo es la VERDAD) BTS tiene mejor discografía, el MV es mejor, el baile es mejor, la calidad es mejor, TODO es mejor, ellos tenían TODO para ganar, dicen que no son xenofobicos ni racistas pero a la hora de pasar bts bajo la voz y lo dijo sin ánimos jaja los grammys son un chiste.
Merecían ganar.
1:40 JIMIN X Floor Best ship ever!!
Este video es una joyita
Гремми поступили не хорошо к вам но мы с вам и все мы знаем что вы намного лучше всех кто говорил про вас плохо 🥰🥺😇💜❤️

Holaaa hermosa ARMY... Quiero darte algunas recomendaciones...   Por favor no uses emojis  Razón: Congela v15t4s . . . Censura las palabras "5tr34m" & "v1st45"  Razón:YouTube no da visibilidad a tu comentario o lo borra . . . Para el 5tr34m: No estés pausando & despausando el video  Razón:YouTube lo considera como Bot & le quita V15T4S  . . . Trata de escuchar la canción sin subtítulos  Razón: Si lo haces de esta manera es más problema que YouTube te cuente la V15t4  . . . Es importante que escuches la canción hasta el final, sumamente importante Razón: Es para que tu V15T4 cuente . . . Trata de recomendar a tus amigxs que escuchen Dynamite  Razon:Creeo que es obvia xD . . . No uses tu tiempo tirando hater, Úsalo en hacer Stream para que Dynamite suba a 1B & los grammys xenófobicos se den cuenta de lo que perdieron.
We love you ♡

Felicidades a los otros artistas que ganaron, me duele tanto que Bts no ganara, son tan talentosos, su talento es unico, Bts, te amamos, siempre estaremos contigo, te apoyaremos en todo, no soltemos nuestras manos. Army entiendo el dolor que sienten pero los otros artistas no merecen que los traten mal, asi como queremos que respeten a Bts, respetemos a lo demas artista, me duele ver, como los otros grupos hablan de las armys por su comportamiento, respetemos, para que nos respeten, Bts nos han enseñado cosas muy bonitas, no dañemos su imagen.

I love this song.😍😍❤
Soy army desde el 2020 8 de julio los conocí y este año cumpliré 10 años y antes de que los conociera yo estaba bien pero ahora estoy mejor sus canciones son mi consuelo por eso siempre antes de ir a haver algo malo o que no debo hacer siempre cantó stay gold ,life goes on , bulletproof,butterfly e incluso dinamyte y por supuesto forever  young y me siento totalmente bien y si leyendo algunos comentarios de otras canciones ser adolescente es difícil  yo sólo soy una niña y aveces me siento muy desconsolada... algunas veces lloro casi nunca  lloro a si que se de repente mi amiga me aconsejo buscar bts por youtube y de ahí surgió mi amor por estos siete Ángeles y todos los días le agradezco a Díos por haberlos traído a mi vida💜💜💜💜.Y además   de todo cuando escucho a bts mi familia me dice " deja de escuchar a esos chinos y espérate en tu vida " cuando me dicen esos comentarios me da ira tristeza y me deconsuelo lo peor de todo es que cuando quiero hablar sobre bts no me puedo desaogar y tengo que mantener esas opiniones mías dentro de mi por que nadie de mis amigos o conocidos se inmuta por eso.. y también me gustaria tener a alguien con quien hablar sobre bts💜💜💜💜💜 ARMY disfrutemos la vida y la de ellos agradescamos que ellos llegaron a nuestras vidas.

To BTS--- I'm writing this for you BTS I'm pretty sure you won't see this but I just want to express my love to you ....I donno why I am acting weird today 😌 Anyways A gentle reminder to u pls consider your health your personal choices and decisions and Don't over work be Happy and Don't look for the negatives We Army's are fine and We are at your back as Pillars and Supporting you always in any matter 💜    To Army's out there Don't be a Solo BTS is a 7 membered group and if you can't love them equally don't forcefully call yourself Army u guys bring hate to this fandom and seriously it hurts for OT7 ones Stream every songs Give priority to those Who are close to certain goals nd work hard and Make our boys proud 😀 Don't think that You are not recognised or BTS don't know you like I mean Don't demotivate yourselves We all together are known as Army's all our contributions are counted even if you strm Okay😃💜    To new Army's out there Our boys and this fandom is great .It is the best decision you have taken and we are thankful you joined this fandom and Discover more about them ask to other Army's and don't follow  solo stans or like some ships and all....  From the heart of an OT7 Army 🙂💜

Hello cute handsome Jin heavenly I purple you
es aqui cuando te das cuenta que los tannies tienen una gran base de fans, mientras que fans de grupos o solistas x presumen con demasía la cantidad excesiva de vist4s pero ni siquiera logran llegar a 2M de lik3s yy la causa verdadera de eso son los anuncios de yt, método para nada orgánico por cierto,,,, pero quienes somos para juzgar¿??ahre, pero de ejemplo esta este B-SIDE, tiene cerca de 125M de vist4s y muchos LIK3S a mi parecer,, pero esqueEEE quien logra reunir 7M DE LIK3S PARA UN BSIDE¿???? UN BSIDE!!???, exacto nadie SOLO BTS es increíble, mucho texto en fin STR34M DYNAMITE Y LGO!!
Jimin you so clumsy ❤️ my baby 😭 he so adorable ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

In the morning listening to this song makes the spirit increase
Are these girls or boys?
Jin 😭😭😭😭😭💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Armys, if you have money can you buy their BE Essential album or deluxe ? Because in that way, dynamite could win 32st cup of music bank next week,, and if we buy more, more chance for dynamite to win the music bank and make dynamite as the song with most won cup in music bank! (Break the record of the most songs to win in music bank) I'm telling this for those who can buy the album <3 for those who can't afford to buy it like me, we need stream BE song and DYNAMITE in all music platform especially youtube and spotify! take note army! Share this to all armys! *Purple heart*
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

If you don't like the song, you don't have to get in here just to throw out I hate how to comment "How ugly" or "They're really ugly, kids" if you don't like it, don't get in here to comment or say "I don't like it 👎"      Tell me how much you like bts  👇

ARMY it will be a crime to have the MTV Unplugged go unnoticed!! Tr.3_nd them to #1 in your countries as much as you can. If fans see BTS first from those performances their prejudice will most certainly be erased.   Setlist: Fix You cover (MTV UK), Life Goes On, Blue and Grey, Telepathy, Dynamite

한국 연예인 이름은 중국에서 중국식 발음으로 소개되는데  한국식 발음 그대로 중국에서 활동해야 합니다. 시진핑도 우리식 발음은 습건평입니다.  중국식 발음은 지켜주면서 우리 이름을 중국식으로 발음한다는건 말이 안됩니다. 이름은 그 사람의 정체성입니다. '아미'들은 어떻게 생각하시나요?

I really got into trying out BTS music coz my fave boy group covered their songs but I'm understanding why they got the attention they got. Down to earth boys, appreciating the music and artists/groups/dances that came before them (and I'm not that even a big fan of those artists that came before them but I appreciate the music they've put on the table before this new generation) I'm honestly appreciative and happy to come across this group, they're sweet and funny and really puts the effort and releases some good music, not to mention, very inspiring. My favourite group is inspired by BTS and I can see why.  If anyone asks, Idk if I'm an ARMY, I'm not there yet and I also don't know who my bias is... Jimin, Hobi, Namjoonie and V are all on point for me, it's hard to choose ;__;
Jungkook in the best👍💯
The song that made me become an ARMY

When i want to see Dynamite MV i prefer to watching this MV more than the official..because i can see them equally💜💜💜💜
yhea dynamite
*Fun fact: you're listening to the song while reading the comments (:*
me los quiero!!!!!!!!!!!!!
너무나 잘불러서 울음이 나와요ㅠㅠ
멋져요
액션이 어떻게 되는지 아세요? 무한~
I like your dance songs more than I like your smile and behavior like children.
essa sem dúvida é minha música favorita deles atual
VAMOS POR LOS 150M
QUE HERMOSO ES VERLOS DIVERTIRSE  :'D
ESTO ES ARTE INSUPERABLE
69th time to stream AND comment on this MV. The Video Call versions are a delight to see...like this video!
This is just too cute
Unpopular opinion: I really like this version of the MV more than the original. The original is not bad by any means (and nothing can beat that multi-coloured smoke wall), but there's something about this one that feels more... personal.
😍사랑해
Soty
Ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can J-Hope, kookie, Suga, Jin, V, Jimin, and RM look like that🥵🥵🥵 My innocence has been taken away from me. Now I can marry no one without thinking of them😩
BTS are performing on MTV Unplugged on Feb. 24 [11am KST] It will be aired globally. Make sure to watch it on your tvs and official links online ARMY. Some of the musicians that appeared on the show are the Eagles, Bob Dylan, The Corrs, Nirvana, and more. Don't miss it.

•	Hopefully you’ll feel like everything is back to normal once you can see your fans again. Jin: At first I thought I’ll probably cry tears of joy. But would I? I don’t really think so. At first I really thought I would, but now I think it might feel like going back home. It depends on who you ask, but I don’t think most people would cry just because they came back to their hometown after being away. I think that’s how I’ll feel: like I’m back where I should be.

Jin: "We did so much and we worked so hard, but the result doesn’t hit you the same way, does it? The—excitement, maybe?—isn’t quite there. There’s a big difference between performing for people and performing for the camera. The performance itself is hard, too, of course. I have to keep at it for months once we start. But when we perform for people, I feel alive."
Los amo ❤ son mi adoración 😘

It took a while for me to realize that this whole song is English
hey #Jungkook needs a cup of milk lmao~~ ARMY LIKE 烏烏醫師 3 小時  ·  首先 #兒童的身高 大多取決於 #基因 遺傳，#飲食 和 #運動 皆為 #輔助。國健署 和 #兒童內分泌科 醫師 都建議 #牛奶 就是最好的  #鈣質來源，另外 #豆乾、#小魚乾、#起士 也都是很好的 #食物。怎麼會直接告訴民眾，光喝牛奶是不夠的？

‼Armys BE essential will be released on 19 february so please prepare for that weeek. Ariana is releasing deluxe version of her album and even tho we will have more sales than her she has more songs on the album than us plus she will release new ones with the deluxe version so she will have A LOT more streams than us wich we should have too. Please spread the word as much as you can and stream that day and all week because we want repeak on bb200 with the album. Let's treat it like a new comeback even tho we all know the songs from BE but a lot of us waited for a cheaper version because the deluxe one was too expensive. This are our goals for that day:  PREORDERS: 4,4m preorders (this is a little too much but let's hope for the best)  BILLBOARD: ->#1 global200 ->#1 global excl. USA ->#1 top social artist ->#1 on billboard 200 ->90-100k pure sales in US in the first week to re-peak ->in case of new song,get it on #1 on hot100 ->re-enter dynamite on top10 on hot100  SPOTIFY: ->8m+ streams for the album(now we have 5m daily wich is not good) ->500k streams for each b-side ->3-4m stream in case of new song ->3m streams for dynamite ->2m streams for Life goes on  YOUTUBE: ->in case of new music video 50m+ views and 5m likes   APPLE MUSIC: ->#1on apple music ->top 100 global ->top 10 USA ->nr #1 in 20+ countries ->re-chart the b-sides on apple music  iTUNES: -> the album nr #1 in 100 countries -> nr #1 in 50+ countries in case we have a new song LET'S DO OUR BEST ARMYS.

The main is not about internet but if the gonna syberlaw the myanmar we can,t tell the world what is happening in Myanmar so need your help   缅甸军方现在正试图像中国大陆一样控制互联网体系 ，中国政府也支持缅甸军方，为了成功政变。中国政府是缅甸人民生活的罪魁祸首。  The Myanmar military is now trying to control the Internet system like mainland China, and the Chinese government also supports the Myanmar military for a successful coup. The Chinese government is the chief culprit in the lives of the Burmese people.
RM dencing eith the CDs is literally me when gringa to the store with my mum
I love the Terminator poster on Jungkook's room wall. That is one of my FAVORITE movie from the 80's.. It  was the time when I was a teenager.

500 thousands comments. Army, we can do it!
I think it's version for ARMY💜
Okay army, why this haven't that much views how original? I can't understand that
when your working out, sing RUN or Not Today. when your tired, sing Coffee. when your sick, sing DNA or Save Me. when its dark, sing Lights. when you just got heartbroken, sing Fake Love. when your expressing your love to someone, sing I NEED U. when your cold, sing FIRE. when your traveling, sing Airplane or Airplane pt.2. when you feel cool, sing DOPE or Mic Drop. when you did something wrong, sing Make It Right. when your clubbing, sing Dionyus. when your feeling happy, sing Euphoria. when you want to fly, sing Wings.  when your getting old, sing young forever. when you miss someone, sing Spring Day. when your feeling hungry (or you want to be hungry, sing Chicken Noodle Soup.
No paro de sonreir de ver a Jin super confiado bailando como quiere <3

"I think we really do have a telepathic connection with our fans. It’s not crystal clear or anything, but I think if we’re sincere then they can feel it somehow. I think that’s why our fans support us and are always by our side." ~ Jimin

Arms Attention ⚠️ Very very important ❗ ❗Read to the end ❗  - As you know, now the situation of BTS and Black Pink is very competitive and narrow.  - And now Blink decided to make the first 2 billion music video of Black Pink and start streaming D4 music video  - If you have read the news, do you know that the first 1 billion music video belongs to Black Pink and you intend to make the first 2 billion music video also belong to Black Pink ??  - If you want the first 2 billion music video to be from BTS, then you no longer need to make other 1 billion music videos  - The power of armies is very high and if they unite together, they can own a 2 billion music video in a short time.  - So unite and try to make BTS's first 2 billion music video  "So how are you ?!" » Start streaming DNA music video now  - Unite for BTS - Because of the boys who are doing their best for us - I know it 's hard to want to make 2 billion music videos in this short time, but please cooperate   💜 We are the largest fandom in the world 💜  💜 We are the BTS Army 💜   💜 We do not insult any fandom or group 💜 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜  Copying is mandatory for armies ❗
Dumex BTS
They are so unique, so lovely, so nice, so gentile, so great, so talented, they are imperfectly perfect, gOSH I LOVE THEM SO MUCH, THEY DESERVE LOVE LOVE, AND LOVE <3

Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you : ) Never give up on your life!
I wish they kept their freestyles from this in the actual music video.

1:35 ジミン氏覚醒中WWW
Jungkook dancing in his room is literally me at 3am
I’ve never listened to BTS, (this is my first time listening to one of their songs) I’ve heard some stories of people attacking some fans but I’ve Laos heard that a small section of fans attack people for no reason. Is that still a problem in the BTS Army community?  I like the song, it’s really catchy.
Btsssssss❤❤❤❤

ATTENTION ARMY  A challenge to all armys change ur username to the same as mine (stream fire from 1thek) so more army will see it fire is getting more views weekly on bighit and streaming it from bighit is just unnecessary if we stream it on 1thek as much we will get 1B this year!!

I don't know if I could write like this or not but I am an army from a small country called Myanmar. It is in southeast Asia. Right now, we are going through a lot of things in this country. The military seized the power from the government and took over the authority. We citizens are still in confusion worrying about what will happen the next day. In the beginning, they cut off all network connections and tv broadcasting lines got shut down in order to prevent us from reaching the world. I think I can't see my 7 princes for a while. I will miss BTS and I will never forget what they taught me and how to love myself. I heard the military will cut off the wifis within 2 hours from now on. Please make this trend on Twitter by using this tag cuz we won't be able to use the internet in a few hours. @/savemyanmar# @/helpmyanmar# @/justice for Myanmar# I love you BTS, my heroes. Praying for the best.    We are in need of help. We are trying to let the world what is happening in Myanmar. #Savemyanmar# Goodbye, my 7 boys and my family Army.
📍Attention Armys📍  We should stream the bts mvs from 1thek channel cuz back then , bts uploaded their mvs on 1thek n bighit labels. so the mvs from 1thek have much more views than bighit labels if we stream mvs from 1thk then we will be reaching 200m , 300m 800m, 1billion nd so on only No more dream from 1thek has less views than Bighit one so stream no more dream from bighit not 1thek   1thk has mvs like  Fire war of hormone boy in luv i need u just one day dope  run no danger etc  many new armys dont know abt it , so spread this comment
im army my friend is army i love armys
나는 당신 모두를 사랑합니다

They are always perfect,,, love you BTS and I purple you
We , Myanmar citizens need  the world to know what's happening in Myanmar right now   before our wifis are cut off.   They already cut off TVs broadcasting lines, phone services in order to prevent us reaching  to the world.  Again in 2021! History is about to be repeated like in 1988. We couldn't let it happen again,guys, please help us in spreading what's happening in Myanmar 🙏🏻🇲🇲  Help us. Military has detained our elected democratic government,party leaders and political activists in Myanmar.Now,national television channels and phone services are cut out nationwide. Help us,world leading democracy #helpus  #SaveMyanmar  #Save #Myanmar 🇲🇲  #Save #Burma 🇲🇲  #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!! #crd

I LOVE BTS,  THIS SONG MY FAVOURITE,  WHO WHO LOVE BTS? WHO WHO ARMY? BTS MEMBERS WHO YOUR BIAS? KIM NAMJOON KIM SEOKJIN MIN YOONGI JUNG HOSEOK  PARK JIMIN KIM TAEHYUNG  JEON JUNGKOOK  BTS
I am very proud to be your fan. I became your fan the first time I saw it. But then I didn't know that being your fan would make such a big difference in my life. I didn't know before that learning can also be learned through music. Everyone used to tell me the same thing, (whatever you say through the song) but I didn't want to understand that. But when I began to see the meaning of your song, I began to understand. The lyrics of this song are really valuable. So we (the armies) should save them and let everyone know about them. Thanks to BTS, for overcoming so many problems in my life. And I'm really proud to be your fan. BTS Please pray for me that your education will help me to become something much better. BTS Take care of yourself.💜💜💜

🚨[BREAKING NEWS]🚨 BTS is dropping BE(essential edition) feb 19th!!!!! It is basically repackage of BE and has been confirmed by bighit. The preorders have already started. Plz keep in mind that this is a new comeback so plz support it the way u supported other albums!! Plz share this message to other armys.
Still missing the jin solo shoots

Armys lets all of us only stream Fake love for 3 days and make it 1B because its the closest to reach then go to Dynamite for 1B, then Mic drop 1B and then Idol 1B this way we can make all 4 MV's 1B before grammys if we all unite together. Please share this on all MV's to reach the goal faster Armys..!!!

Hi Armies! Remember to vote, but please do NOT encourage others to vote last second. This is due to the fact that some might forget and every vote counts!! And Please remember to not bring other groups down to boost your favourite group. I hate to be that one person that ruins the “fun,” but I just wanted to spread awareness! Good luck to all fandoms, and please do not start fandom wars and please do not encourage rude or unnecessary behaviour!
DYNNNN NANANANANANANA EH DYNNNN NANANANANANANA EH DYNNNN NANANANANANANA EH LIGHT IT UP,DYNAMITEEEEEEEE
This version of the video is more carefree and fun to watch!! The other is more professionally done but I like this one better! You can actually catch them genuinely laughing and having fun with it

61st time to stream AND comment on this MV. ARMY, let us be more organized and make streaming BTS MVs a DAILY habit. If the WHOLE fandom could only stream at least THREE BTS OFFICIAL MVs EVERY DAY for a year, we could achieve seemingly impossible things! Please adopt three BTS Official MVs and stream them at least once a day. Every little bit counts. Of course, if you decide to do more, so much the better. But this daily habit is the bare minimum. FIGHT! #ThreeBTSMVsEachDay
O final é o melhor kkkkkkk

BTS tries very, very hard. More than you can imagine. They think of us in the most difficult moments. Let us be together forever. And give them a lot of energy so that maybe the hard work they put in will be compensated. Thank you, BTS.✌🏻🌸🙇‍♀️

ARMY who streaming right now don't forget to vote BTS on SMA we already lose in gaon...so please help to widen the gap just install SMA apps from apple store or play store  P/s: Kindly check bts voting team page on Instagram/Facebook and Twitter for more information Please don't ignore this
in 2012, i was 11 years old, and i really love kpop girlgroups (all of them) but never like kpop boygroup, idk why i just feel like boygroup shouldn’t sing and dance. but in the end of 2014, i found bts, at first i was just listening their song but never watch their videos, and i like their song (especially danger). but then i started to watch their dance video, i was so impressed, their dance is sooooo catchy and the dance break (we are bulletproof), omg i was so speechless..... from then, i started to watch their videos as much as possible, and i found that their personality is really really good. and my conclusion, i stand the right boyband🥰

56th time to stream AND comment on this MV. ARMY, please be mindful of the BTS MVs you are streaming. Let us support the MVs that have a HIGHER view count (as in the cases of Big Hit and 1theK videos). Stream 1theK versions of FIRE, DOPE, BOY IN LUV, RUN, and the like). We will never reach milestones faster if you continue to stream the Big Hit versions that have much lower view counts. Please manually search the MVs and do not click images wantonly. Search for the 1theK versions PLEASE.
Is it just me or am I the only one who likes this version better? 😄

I'm an Army since July 2020 and BTS literally changed my life. I never felt so touched and inspired by music before meeting BTS. I'm so thankful to be part of this big family and I will never stop cheering for our 7 boys. They deserve it so much, they saved the life of so many people. I hope they can truly feel the love Army has for them. I felt so inspired by them that I decided to create some YouTube videos about BTS to show the people how preciuos they are for me and for all Armys. If you have time you can check it, it would make me really happy, because I worked so hard on it! :)))) https://youtu.be/QCLD4q_NjDE

Is it just me, or does this video almost feel like the gag reel of the official video? I'm not saying it's bad because of that, I'm just saying it gives off that vibe to me.

At 3:24, Taehyung is being super weird
And what never changed from the original dynamite and the b side dynamite is Jin’s signature move, 𝕡𝕠𝕚𝕟𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕒𝕥 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕔𝕖𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕨𝕙𝕚𝕝𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕠𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕣 𝕙𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕚𝕤 𝕠𝕟 𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕙𝕚𝕡 lol
Taehyung is too funnny, 1:16, teleportation 😱 Also, imagine BTS saying 𝔹𝕝𝕒𝕔𝕜 𝕡𝕚𝕟𝕜 𝕚𝕟 𝕪𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕒𝕣𝕖𝕒. It would be hilarious
I love ♥️ jungkook
OK..is anyone gonna talk about suga like he is so dashing 😍
They are the best the best and the best. I LOVE THEM ALL. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP BEING AN ARMY.

There is a scene where BTS members wash their hands while singing a song... The scene was a scene from PSY Gangnam Style's elevator GUY on the air. BTS paroed it. It is also famous in Korea because it is so funny.
Adoro todos eles é claro só q amo mais Taehyung😍😍😍

Jungkook's tongue kept wriggling during the second take of the donut🍩🍩 eating scene..maybe the others were jealous of him during that take and he was trying to tease them by helding it upwards🤡😬💜💜 still this mv became one of the best retro and disco mvs of the new generation..
V 'S SHOT HAD ME SHOOKED
IN SOME PARTS TAEHYUNG LOOKED LIKE ACTOR JI CHANG WOOK . AND V BAEKHYUN  JI CHANG WOOK LOOK ALIKE
Awesome really liked it

안녕하세요 지민아  안녕하세요 BTS :) 저는이란 출신이고 제 병역이 자랑 스럽습니다. 남들이 뭐라고하든 나는 살기 위해 군대에 남을 것입니다. 그들이 우리 가족을 질투한다는 것을 알고 있으므로 걱정하지 마십시오.  나는 한국에 가고 싶어서 당신이 오기를 기다릴 것입니다. 제 한국 이름은 Sunny( 싸니)이고 제 이름은 Mahdieh(맣디애)입니다.  어려운 순간에 내 영혼을 준 방탄 소년단 덕분에 당신의 군대를 사랑합니다 내 혜성처럼 나와 동의한다면 :)))) 가능한 한 빨리 설탕이 회복되기를 바랍니다. 몸조심 해 사랑해 방탄 소년단 내 사랑 지민 방탄 소년단 10 만 개의 군대가 있으면 나도 그들 중 하나이고, 지구에 군대가 있으면 나도 있고, 군대가 없으면 죽었다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 파이팅 ^^ Hello Jimin Hello BTS :) I am from Iran and I am proud to be in the army. Whatever others say, I will stay in the army to live. Do not worry because you know they are jealous of our family.  I want to go to Korea, so I will wait for my arrival. My Korean name is Sunny and my name is Mahdieh.  I love your army thanks to the bulletproof boys who gave me my soul in difficult times If you agree with me, like my comet :)))) I hope suga recovers as soon as possible. Take care of yourself, I love you, BTS, my love Jimin BTS Know that if there is 100,000 armies on earth, I am one of them, if there is one army on earth, I am, and if there is no army, I am dead. Fighting ^^ سلام جیمین سلام BTS :) من اهل ایران هستم و به سربازی افتخار می کنم. دیگران هرچه بگویند ، من در ارتش می مانم تا زندگی کنم. نگران نباشید زیرا می دانید که آنها به خانواده ما حسادت می کنند.  من می خواهم به کره بروم ، بنابراین منتظر آمدنم خواهم ماند. نام کره ای من سانی و نام من مهدیه است.  من ارتش شما را دوست دارم به لطف پسرهای ضد گلوله که در لحظات سخت روح مرا به من هدیه کردند اگر با من موافقید مثل دنباله دار من :)))) امیدوارم هر چه زودتر قند بهبود یابد. مراقب خودت باش ، من تو را دوست دارم ، BTS ، عشق من جیمین BTS بدانید که اگر 100000 ارتش در زمین وجود داشته باشد ، من یکی از آنها هستم ، اگر یک ارتش در زمین وجود داشته باشد ، من هستم و اگر ارتش وجود نداشته باشد ، من مرده ام. جنگیدن ^^

oooh... I can't even tell you how much I love these guys. When I look at them, I realize that they are not a group, there are family. They are beautiful and don't deserve dislikes.   P.S.-Hoby is a little sunshine 😭😭 I love him so much. He is my Idol. He is a small charge of energy. He is changed my life. I am extremely grateful to him.  You’re my Hope, Hoby:)  (And sorry my English, guys 😂😂) I’m trying to translate

Hi armys
Stan BTS FOR HIGHER STANDARTS
They're literally spamming 3 months old MV🤦
Como que dynamite no me quiere dejar en paz.... hmm. :3
Forty-sixth time to stream AND comment on  this MV since 6 Oct 2020. These outtakes are really very amusing, showing the kooky, playful side of BTS. What a delight to watch again and again!
Son los seres más mágicos del mundo entero, su naturalidad es inmensa, gracias por toda su sinceridad hacia todos, ustedes son reales seres humanos de admirar, los amo muchísimo.

Hobi is so cute 🥺💖
I love suga and I love them all 😻💜💜💜
Me da risa la voz del coreógrafo riéndose en el donde cuando los chicos se equivocaron
ı love jiminn
I lost everyone in my life  Now I'm handling on my own , my uncle is taking care of me but it's hard to ask him money or something, then I created a YouTube channel but it didn't go well it got only 98 subscribers in 1 year , this song meant to be , I can create lyrics song for this song too support me guys  Beautiful souls around the globe :-\  Dynamite b - side
Such moves
Goooooooooooddddddd im SCREAMING
110m soon
クリーニング毛怪我ケキケ家けい劇けけ買うお
They are so adorable uwu
The only question for me is...  *What is actually B-side means?*
hi loml
Everyone let's make Dynamite M/V reach 700M before 17 Dec and make a record of fastest M/V to reach 700M. We can do it and we will!!... Fighting!! 💜💜
Jimin aquí parece tan niño jajaja me produce mucha ternura. Siento que está chiquito, hay que cuidarlo... A parte Jimin tiene una voz muy llamativa, siempre me derrite el oído 😁💐💜
Best forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
vayan al otro mv de dynamite, tenemos que llegar a los 700M!!
200M soon!
3:29 - 3:36 just Taehyung looking like the finest man for 8 seconds
Go stream DYNAMITE!!!! Let’s try reach 700million before the 17th of December so it can be the fastest Korean MV to reach 700million!!!! Let’s go ARMY!!!
Me gusta tanto q ya me la coreografía de cada uno 😅
DYNAMITE - 700M LIFE GOES ON - 200M BOY WITH LUV - 1.1B DNA - 1.2B BST - 700M FAKE LOVE - 900M NMD - 200M DAECHWITA - 200M
Okay, I’m gonna say this once and for all. I’m one of those guys that loves his women AND only women. In fact, I even have a gf. But for some reason, Jimin makes me excited whenever I see him. He’s like the only guy in this world that can turn me, from straight, into curvy as shit.
Tae tae💜

Don muy lindos todos los amo me encantan y sobre td cantan muy lindo
Min Yoongi
This reminds me of their old Dance practice videos, where you can see some bloopers, different takes, and them breaking character and really just having a good time and feeling the music. They look like they're really enjoying themselves here. 😁😊
I’ve never really listened to BTS       Oh boy I should’ve listened sooner :)
2:33 onwards of this MV is better than the original
LET'S ARMYS, 110M FIGHTING!!

Here's a story. I've heard this song played on a noontime show. First time I've heard it I was like this song is cool it has funky beat in it. So first time I've heard it I wanted to search for the artist og Google but then I got busy that I forgot.  Yesterday while eating at a Korean restaurant the song was played and then I was surprised the song was performed by BTS. Sorry I didn't know BTS is the artist. I'm musical inclined person but leaning towards Jazz, rock, alternative, funk and punk rock. Now I know why the group is popular. They are so successful because of their music. I have to search for the songwriter.  Here's a fun fact his name is David Stewart. 👍

Uuuu.... Me matan  Con tanta hermosura Obra de arte Romeo queda tontito al lado de ustedes Una literatura única Una sonrisa Un amor único y sincero Una bala de no daña sino que enseña.. Hernosos
me los quiero comer a besos }
amo a estos bebes me hacen reir siempre insert purple heart

ATTENTION!!! WE HAVE A NEW GOAL TO BREAK!! BTS OFFICIAL CHANNEL AKA "BANGTANTV" IS AWAY FROM 8 MILLION SUBCRIBERS TO HIT 50 MILLION!!! (remember when someone hits 50 million SUBCRIBERS they get a custom YT button this should be no deal!) AND BIG HIT LABELS IS ONLY 1 MILLION SUBCRIBERS AWAY WE CAN HIT 50 MILLION SUBCRIBERS IT SHOULD BE NO DEAL AND BLACKPINK HAS THE MOST SUBCRIBED CHANNEL  IN KPOP WE CAN BREAK THIS AS WELL THEY HAVE 54 MILLION SUBCRIBERS EVERY ARMY SUBCRIBE TO BTS TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE!!!! (Copy and paste and spread the news!!)
I love v

Olá, Galera, tudo bem?   Eu Sou Dorgival Dantas Brito, São Paulo, Brasil. Sou amigo do Arthur (Arthur L Bennet Risolf, Vocalista do BTS, DYNAMITE) O Facebook Bloqueou Minha Conta (Facebook e Mensage) e agora eu não Consigo mais Entrar e o meu Contato do Arthur estava lá. Peço Por gentileza. Quem for amigo do Arthur passar essa mensagem pra ele. Para o Arthur Entrar em contato comigo. Eu só conheço o Arthur do Mensage mesmo e nem sabia que ele era artista. Ele que me contatou primeiro. E à gente acabou fazendo amizade. Acho legal que ele me mandou uma foto dá irmã dele e depois disse que ela era casada. E eu falei: "Cara, Você me manda à foto dá sua irmã, casada?" E ele disse: "O que é que têm? Às fotos dela tá nas revistas do país inteiro." À Irmã dele é Modelo Na Korea. Obrigado.     Hello, guys, how are you?   I am Dorgival Dantas Brito, São Paulo, Brazil. I'm a friend of Arthur (Arthur L Bennet Risolf, BTS vocalist, DYNAMITE). Facebook Blocked My Account (Facebook and Message) and now I can't log in anymore and my Arthur Contact was there. I ask Please. Anyone who is a friend of Arthur will pass this message on to him. For Arthur to contact me. I only know Arthur do Mensage and I didn't even know he was an artist. He who contacted me first. And we ended up making friends. I think it's cool that he sent me a picture of his sister and then said that she was married. And I said: "Dude, will you send me the picture of your sister, married?" And he said, "What do you have? Her photos are in magazines all over the country." His sister is a model in Korea. Thank you all.
Love you

Vminkook ft. Jin and RM. Special thanks to J-Hope and Suga for their participation.
cutest B side ever
This song's whole vibe is so unlike all the others that I have heard before. It's sort of cheery, at the same time old-fashioned. This song is a MASTERPIECE. Periodt

I am  love
Let's BTS ,tell me it's meaning
Unpopular opinion: *Dynamite is too overhyped.* Compared to BTS lyrical masterpieces like I Need U, Save Me, BST, DNA, Mic Drop, Idol, Euphoria etc, Dynamite was nowhere close enough. The lyrics were plain nonsensical.   "Get this beat cha ching like money" ~ Dynamite  vs  "I may be a bit blunt, I may lack some things I may not have that shy glow around me But this is me My arms, my legs, my heart, my soul Not so perfect but so beautiful I'm the one I should love" ~ Epiphany  and  "While I stand on this hot, empty stage I fear the emptiness In my complicated thoughts On the lines of life I pretend to be blunt about it It’s not even the first time It’s time I should be used to it Even though I try to hide it I can’t As the stage gets cooler I leave the empty audience seats" ~ Young Forever  Do I even need to say anything? Dynamite had a catchy tune and that's all it had. The MV was quite underwhelming compared to the masterpieces they have released in the past (Mic Drop and BST just keep me coming back everyday). They could have done a lot more with the retro concept and the stylisation could use a lot of work. Jin's hair colour didn't suit him at all and the ONLY outfit I even remember was Tae's green gucci suit. The rest of the outfits were expensive as hell too, but too bland and generic. Simply put, Dynamite is the only BTS song that was way overhyped. I love BTS to bits, but I don't believe in sending a misleading message to our boys that putting out mediocre songs which armys will stream crazily just to break so and so's record is the way to go. THEY CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER AND BE IS THE PROOF.

For Jin Bias: MMA2019 JIN FOCUS You can see the gorgeous dancing king Jin clearly. Especially MMA2019_Dionysos_Jin Focus is the best of the best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiAtXS7A_Ms  Epiphany (Jin's Solo) This beautiful healing song will comfort your soul. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIkZOLsnoqY
유튜브에서 bts jin focus 로 search해보시면 진의 댄스실력과 미모,가창력에 깜짝 놀라실 겁니다. 특히  MMA2019_Dionysus_Jin focus 는 진의 진가를 볼 수 있는 역대급 무대영상입니다. MMA2019 디오니소스 무대는 전체샷도 멋진 무대였지만 진이 거의 안보여서 아쉬윘는데 jin focus 영상을 보니 뒤에서 그렇게 엄청나게 멋진춤을 추고 있었더라구요. 강력 추천합니다.  그리고 진의 가창력을 보시려면 진의 솔로곡 Epiphany 영상 추천합니다. 왜 세계적인 팝페라가수 임형주님이 은빛보이스라고 칭찬했는지 이해가 가실꺼예요  For Jin Bias: MMA2019 JIN FOCUS You can see the gorgeous dancing king Jin clearly. Especially MMA2019_Dionysos_Jin Focus is the best of the best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiAtXS7A_Ms  Epiphany (Jin's Solo) This beautiful healing song will comfort your soul. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIkZOLsnoqY

I haven't been able to sleep for a few days. and before sunrise I listen to your unique voices. All my life I thought I would do this alone, but yesterday I was watching the sunrise on the balcony that opened your song, and a tabby cat came next to me. Today, I will go out to the grocery store and sing the same song. I hope it comes again. Being alone is too bad.

Cuando llegue el invierno, respiremos  Un aliento más cálido    No se ve el final
Este resfriado que me dio el mundo  Me hace presionar el retroceder cubierto de polvo  Bailando fuera de ritmo tumbado en el suelo
Supongo que, al final, soy humano  Estoy en un mundo de penas

Recuerden no andar presumiendo que 방탄소년단 es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los #Grammys 2020 con Dynamite, porque ya saben que los kpopers y los poperos se pueden molestar si decimos que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nomimación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite, aunque de seguro ya vieron que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite porque en todas las redes sociales están diciendo que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite, no hay que repetir dos veces que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite aunque para quieres no sepan que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite.  Para resumirles todo esto, BTS es primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite pero no lo digan mucho.  Posdata: BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación enlos Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite Posdata 2: BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite Postdata 3: BTS es el único acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite.   Por último les recuerdo que BTS es el primer acto coreano en tener una nominación en los Grammy's 2020 con Dynamite.
btsssss
I LOVE YOU
Don't forget to vote for BTS at MAMA!

كان يا مكان في قديم الزمان… كنت مليانه بالهم والأحزان  إلى أن تعرفت علـّى. سبعة فتيان  يطلق عليهم أسم بانتقان  قائدهم نامجون قاهر العديان  والوسيم جين ذو الجمال الفتان  وأبنهم تاي أجمل ما تراه العينان  وجيهوب الذي رقصه يشعل النيران  وجيمين الذي جعل كل أرمي عاشق ولهان وجنغكوك معشوق الفتيات والفتيان  ولا ننسى شوقا الكسول والنعسان أنهم نجوم سيستمرون باللمعان ومشجعيهم الأرمي أسطوره لن يكررها الزمان:)
This is the MV which i like little bit more because i can find JIN LITTLE BIT MORE.

99.965~ I hope we can somehow make the B-side reach 100M too. We only needs 45K  Do ARMY think we can reach it by Monday? #DynamiteBsideTo100M Let's get it~
ARMY can we organize/schedule a  $+ræm!ng party every weekend during the CB month (so those who goes to work or have school can also participate) and then at least every other weekend (2 weekends a month) after the comeback month (succeeding months) to also increase the volume of v!3w$ for all BTS songs/MVs to reach our #BTS8SongsTo1B anniversary project.  Please share the idea in your Socials (Twitter Instagram Weverse etc) so that other ARMY and big ARMY accounts can help us organize the party. Thank you.  Remember: Team work makes the dream work. Let's keep yo eyes on the ball  Let's get it ARMY

250k to go Please share this: We have 0 radio plays we need to focus on BE as our main goal. Make sure you are using BANGTANTV not fake channels for LGO and other BE tracks for Billboard. Listen to BE on Spotify and iTunes. Spread it on Twitter, TikTok, Instagram or any social media you are active in. We can call and request for radio plays but they are laughing it off as it is in another language.

REJECT VACCINATION AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MASK WEARING POLICIES. THESE ARE PROTOCOLS FOR SPIRITUAL DESTRUCTION. THEY ARE PURE EVIL. MAY YOU BE DELIVERED FROM DARKNESS.* ☯︎  *Do your research. Start with "Béchamp or Pasteur? A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology", by Ethel Douglas Hume (1923) and "Pasteur: Plagiarist & Impostor — The Germ Theory Exploded", by R.B. Pearson (1942). Share this book with your loved ones. It will change the world. Thank me, later.* https://www.docdroid.net/t5NonoL/bc3a9champ-or-pasteur-a-lost-chapter-in-history-of-biology-1-pdf   Literally, all that *anyone* without an epidemiological background has to do to know that there is no virus is GO OUTSIDE, breathe in some fresh air, and walk back in. This is fucking absurd. The entire world fucking absurd. There is no virus/epidemic/pandemic. The mask has no practical function and *only* serves as a symbol of consent. Do not participate in this ritual. Stop watching television & start reading books. Television exist to create opinion; books exist to share knowledge. People have been exposing vaccines as useless/harmful/destructive EARLY as 1902 (See: John W. Hodge, "The Vaccination Superstition: Prophylaxis To Be Realized Through The Attainment Of Health Not The Propagation Of Disease"), 1920 (See: Charles Michael Higgins, "Horrors Of Vaccination Exposed And Illustrated: Petition To The President To Abolish Compulsory Vaccination In Army And Navy"), and 1957 (See: Eleanor McBean, "The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts About Vaccination"). This is a ruse to scare you into consent.  Klaus Schwab and his co-conspirators at the WEF (World Economic Forum) have a plan to shape the Face of the Earth into a dystopian panopticon and THIS PLAN WILL CRASH AND BURN. Read all about it *in their own words* here: "COVID-19: The Great Reset" by Klaus Schwab and Thierry Malleret on Amazon.com. If you do not condemn these psychopaths/megalomaniacs NOW, and teach others the truth about what is being done to the Human Spirit, YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM. Humanity, FIGHT BACK!   It is unacceptable that the international community will literally believe *whatever* flashes across the television screen. ALL news anchors (in every country and language) are hand-picked by public relations committees to promote whatever their clientele are interested in. They have no egalitarian motivations and are not concerned about safety; They are only concerned about following orders & serving their masters.  For those unfamiliar with the history of allopathy, here's a brief run-down: Vaccines are (completely) unnecessary, and present nothing but danger to the immune system (which is perfect). Vaccines are made with toxic chemicals, including aluminum, formaldehyde, human chorionic gonadotrophin, polysorbate, latex (plastic), mercury, etc. For a full list of vaccine ingredients, visit this page:  http://www.whale.to/vaccines/ingredients.html  Before vaccination was a common hospital protocol, the rate of autism was 1/1000 children. Post-vaccination, that rate is 1/50 children. Boys are disproportionately affected by autism because of differences in puberty. For a historical understanding of vaccination in the United States/West, watch this video by Clint Richardson:  https://www.bitchute.com/video/YNH0YOqaXIx7/  Take notes if necessary. For the autism/vaccination connection, watch this video by author Amandha Vollmer (it also discusses how to heal autism, naturally):  https://lbry.tv/@yumnaturals:0/healing-autism-naturally:f  In this video, Amandha Vollmer proves beyond a shadow-of-a-doubt (with evidence) that all reportedly "positive" PCR test results are not identifying a virus, but in fact, identifying chromosome 8 primary sequence. This is human DNA. This might be the most important video for you to watch if you want a simple, straight-forward answer:  https://lbry.tv/@yumnaturals:0/bombshell-evidence-that-covid-is:e   For the legal aspect, and information which is not often discussed in public, purchase this book by Wayne Rohde about the VICC (Vaccination Injury Compensation Court):  https://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Court-Americas-Compensation-Program/dp/1629144525  For the scientific understanding, please watch the video series "Tolerance Lost" by the late doctor Andrew Moulden, presented in 3 parts:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re8UI8aCLpM (Part 1)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbASRgUT5Kc (Part 2)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6Qyc_nteag (Part 3)  For a comprehensive list of resources on the topic, in the form of books & articles, visit this page:  http://www.whale.to/vaccines.html  And if you have specific questions, you can ask me. There are so many resources out there. The subject is not new. People have been debunking/exposing this s*** for years. Before the internet, before social media, before all this nonsense. Most people *haven't* done their research, and it shows. But you can change that. You always have the power of choice.  https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691633978/the-private-science-of-louis-pasteur  This book was written two years after the diaries of Louis Pasteur, which were a family heirloom, came under the care of Gerald L. Geison in 1993, a professor at Princeton. In the diaries, L.P. confesses to the fraud (lies, failure, inconsistencies, plagiarized experiments) of his life's work. On his death bed, Pasteur proclaimed "the germ is nothing; the terrain is everything".  https://www.docdroid.net/rB9DQfS/exposing-the-myth-of-the-germ-theory-1-pdf  It is impossible to catch a virus from someone. The myth of contagion is based on 1864 writings by Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur was proven wrong and exposed as a fraud multiple times, including in two books — "Béchamp or Pasteur? A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology", by Ethel Douglas Hume (1923) and "Pasteur: Plagiarist & Impostor — The Germ Theory Exploded", by R.B. Pearson (1942). Furthermore, a virus lacks metabolism, a necessary component of all living matter. A "virus" is nothing more than dead, motionless, cellular debris. What we call viruses are natural by-products of the body's cleansing cycle and are not an invasive species to be feared. Because a "virus" is produced within the isopathic terrain of one's own immunology, wearing a mask is unnecessary. Not only is wearing a mask unnecessary, wearing a mask causes lung acidosis - this is wherein the waste particles are recycled into your immune system instead of being excreted into the atmosphere, which causes lung infections and throat infections. Wearing a mask will slowly compromise the overall health of your immune system, increase cortisol levels in the blood, and condition your neighbors into being scared of something that does not exist.   As a result of the on-going fear-mongering/propaganda/gaslighting, an unreported number of people have either fallen into bankruptcy OR committed suicide. We are currently in the midst of a war. They are the real causalities, unlike the imaginary deaths & poorly-staged "mass graves" you see on TV. Being driven into a corner, the human being will eventually break. These are the basic tenets of psychological warfare and political subversion. Those who are wearing masks unknowingly harm themselves and mock the dead.   The CDC/WHO are the Enemies of Mankind. The media hydra of network television (MSNBC/CNN/CBS/ABC/FOX/NBC/BBC) remains one of the most reliable and convincing forms of propaganda. Edward Bernay's techniques still loom over the consciousness of man. The CDC/WHO want to re-engineer human relationships by destroying intimacy between people: social distancing and mask wearing (especially in conjunction with each other) have profoundly negative affects on the amygdala.   *If you are the parents of children currently enrolled in school and the school requires that your child wears masks for attendance, it is of the utmost importance that you share this information with the school for the sake of your child, and all children.*   The world belongs to no one but God, least of all the government/politicians/psychopaths.  The world is not for anyone to 'open' or 'close'.  The world does not belong to the loudest voice in the room. #DontStayHome #GodIsPerfect #NoNewNormal  Video (Not Available On YouTube):  KSCO Radio Tom Quinn Interviews Amandha Vollmer on Germ Theory  https://lbry.tv/@yumnaturals:0/ksco-radio-tom-quinn-interviews-amandha:9  Misinterpretation VIRUS II by Dr. Stefan Lanka  https://lbry.tv/@yumnaturals:0/misinterpretation-virus-ii-by-dr-stefan:4  Suppression vs Expression - An Understanding of a Fundamental Natural Health Law  https://lbry.tv/@yumnaturals:0/suppression-vs-expression-an:7  Connecting the Dots: Why They’re Doing This  https://www.bitchute.com/video/mSwYs6zB6TI/  Have A Good Day.

Yoongi :'(
مشكورين يا بيج هيت عقبال ما تجيبيهم هنا عندنا و عادي بخبر الوالده تسوى الاكل...
How to str3am well: 1) have the session started 2) Don't use incognito mode 3) Don't l00p the video 4) See the video with the volume +50% 5) See again the video after 2-3 anothers videos. It's better see others MV's of BTS with the sames conditions to str3am 6) Don't use em0jis 7) Don't report or answer hate c0mments, just ignore them 8) Censorship the words like str3am, em0jis, vi3ws, etc... 9) See the ads on the video, or at least the half of them 10) Don't pause, advance or lag the video 11) See the video +480p 12) Like the video at the end 13) Don't dowloand the video, better share it 14) Search the video manually 15) Don't use VPN, APK, etc  I hope I helped you :) Please, share it to others Armys

FOR COMEBACK:  Please make sure you are logged into YouTube for streaming Dynamite and BE for comeback .... views will count on YT if you are not logged in, but not for Billboard.  So please ensure you are logged in.  For new ARMY's, when you are streaming do not skip, pause, FF or manipulate the MV in any way ... don't skip ads, they are part of the view.  DO NOT use the mini-player, or view the MV in a separate window on your browser, or YT will not count the view.  Have 8 to 10 minutes in between views of the MV, do not repeat the MV over and over, or it will not count.  Keep your comments to 1 to 2 for each view, otherwise YT may see your comments as spam and delete your view.  You can queue your songs, but DO NOT use playlist in the first 24 hours ... songs on a playlist will not be counted by YT for hours and sometimes days, so please don't use a saved playlist.

♡É hoje o lançamento do BE,preparadas Armys??♡ ●O Hope postou no Weverse,e pela suas palavras percebi ele bem tenso e inseguro do trabalho concluído por eles. ●O Suga,creio q todos sabem,está afastado do grupo por problemas em seu braço,foi feita a cirurgia e agora ele precisa descansar muito,se recuperar por inteiro,tomar medicamentos e fazer fisioterápia para voltar com saúde para nós. E também para estar pronto para o serviço militar q será começado daqui uns anos. ●Todos os meninos deram,TUDO de si. Eles trabalharam muito,fizeram tudo praticamente sozinho...Com certeza foi muito cansativo. Eles estão estão inseguros,n precisamos vê-los para saber. E normal,eles fizeram...O medo da negação do público é algo q com certeza está tirando o sono deles. O Hope deixou nítido q está com medo. Todos os álbuns são importantes,mas esse é 1000× mais...Foi eles q fizeram. ●O que eu peço é q vcs recebam esse álbum com muito mas muito amor. Ouça as músicas com carinho... ●Se o álbum ñ emplacar,as views ficarem baixas,Life Goes On n conseguir 100M em 24 hs de novo é claro q eles vão se sentir mal. Eles vão se culpar,é achar q n fizeram um bom trabalho,vão ficar tristes,e autoconfiança em si msm vai abaixar. Antes do idol,vem o ser humano. Esse álbum é diferente.  Fazer eles se culparem e se sentirem tristes ñ é legal né? Eles fizeram o álbum,mas somos nós q damos o retorno para todo o trabalho q tiveram.  ●Temos um motivo a mais para fazer hitar e quebrar recordes. O suga. Mesmo q ele ñ esteja presente fisicamente,nós n esqueceremos dele. Imagina a felicidade dele a ver o album e Life Goes On hitando q nem Dynamite?Lindo né? ●Vamos pensar com carinho,assistir com carinho,bater todas as metas propostas e quebrar recordes. ●Vamos tentar bater 110M em 24 hs. ●Vamos dar stream da forma certa. ●Vamos fazer o BE ficar em 1° lugar na HOT100 para eles e as pessoas n pensarem q Dynamite ficou pk é uma música em inglês. ●Se tiver pessoas tentando congelar as views,denuncie. ●Atenção nos charts. ●Aproveite o álbum.
موفق باشیدT-T

EMERGENCY ARMY! BTS's very first self-directed album 'BE' drops in a few hours, on November 20th at 2pm KST/12am EST.  The members were heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet.  "It's an album from which you can feel the entirety of each member's warmth" to quote Hobi. This will be their most personal and most intimate album so far. Let's do our best to make history again and give the boys what they deserve!  You can watch the two teaser videos of their new MV 'Life Goes On'(directed by Jungkook) here ->  Teaser 1: (https://)youtu.be/Wq5S8Dt_HQE  Teaser 2: (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3KZnCgiMW0&ab_channel=BigHitLabels  'Life Goes On' digital mp3 pre-order:  (https://)bts-be.us/products/life-goes-on-mp3  'BE' album pre-order:  (https://)biglink.to/bebts  'BE' album pre-save link on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer: (https://)www.bts-be.com/  Join in for the MV premier on bangtantv's Youtube channel half an hour before the MV drops (at 11:30pm KST). Like the video and stay there till the countdown ends, it will automatically direct you to the 'Life Goes On' MV!  Our first 24 hours goal on Youtube is 105 Million views. We got 101 Million on Dynamite, we can definitely do it! Very important to not use playlists on Youtube in the first 24 hours because views are counted slower in playlists. It would badly affect our goal. Search for the MV manually by using the searching bar and never refresh or never ever loop/replay/put an MV (or song) on autoplay! Such streams are always filtered out/deleted! Watch other videos in between, preferably other official BTS videos. You can watch the audio videos from the new album bangtantv will release to boost the streams of the album or other BTS MVs.  Use playlists all the time on OTHER platforms like Spotfy or Apple Music but switch them frequently, about every hour. It's a key to stream correctly! Switch playlists, interact with them, pause or skip songs sometimes to look less botlike.  If you can't stream aloud because you are at school/work or are sleeping just use earphones and stream like that. Never mute!  If you don't have the time to stream on Youtube manually in the first 24 hours I still advise you to put the videos in a queue instead of using playlists. Playlist is no good on this one platform.^^  Stay consistent, stay strong, don't panic even if the views will feeze or get deleted, it's normal and happens to everyone while Youtube is trying to verify all views in the high traffic. They will add views back later on so just keep streaming. Get motivation from such situations and push even harder!  From the moment the MV/album drops it's BTS lockdown. We don't pay any attention to hate. If you see any just report and move on, don't interact, that's what they want. Don't even tell others, don't mind them, don't let them ruin the comeback for you. Just ignore and enjoy the comeback.  A last tip: to lessen the chance of your views being considered as bot behaviour and being filtered out/deleted what you can and should do is get a free premium trial on all streaming platforms you used to use. They cost nothing! And only take about a minute. It worked amazingly during Dynamite comeback, we need it this time too, it is crucial. So please if you still haven't yet this is the perfect time to activate a free premium trial, so do it! If you had one for Dynamite and it has expired since then it's all fine, just create a new account on whichever platform and activate the free premium trial there.  Free premium trials for you ->  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  Apple Music: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D   If you wanna help with sales by buying the album/song/MV on iTunes but don't have an apple device it's no problem, you can use iTunes on PC/laptop too, just download it there and you can buy them all.  If you wanna help by streaming on Apple Music and don't have an apple device don't worry, you can download Apple Music on android/PC/laptop, it will work perfectly fine on those too. But beware! IF you bought a song or the MV on iTunes you have to go to your Apple Music lybrary and delete them from there or otherwise your streams won't be counted. This is very important, don't forget about it. This is only if you buy the songs/MV on iTunes. iTunes -> for buying Apple Music -> for streaming  Let's get the boys high with this comeback, they mentioned their worris about this one since it is a very meaningful album for them and it most likely won't get any support from the industry like how Dynamite did since it's all in Korean this time. The boys really wanna get those #1 positions on all charts with songs in their native language too, let's make their dream come true and make them happy!  And most importantly: enjoy the comeback fam!  Happy comeback season 💜
Are your ready?
Chicosss alguien vio cuando kokie se levanta en la puerta miren pasa una sombra😨

We have to increase views of the new song, so that it's a gift from ARMY to BTS, and what we forget. This is Jungkook's first work. We have to cheer them on and get 111 million views in the first 24 hours. And 9.8 million likes in the fastest time and waiting for the first broadcast will be 3.5 million. Set up your accounts to increase views and share them with the largest number of ARMY
2M more let's keep streaming fighting 100M

98.251~ I hope we can somehow make the B-side reach 100M too
Life goes on
Hey ARMY, it would be really cool if we can make 8 BTS songs reached 1B before their 8th year anniversary. An ARMY even says that they could be the first artist to have the record of 8 MVs with 1B v13ws if it happens and that would be a great gift for their 8th year anniversary. We can make it happen  Recommendation: ✓ DNA ✓ BWL  3. Fake Love (needs +187M) 4. Idol (needs +210M) 5. Mic Drop (needs +210M) 5. BST (needs +341M) 7. Dynamite (needs +390M) 8. Fire in 1theK (needs +332M)  I hope we can have a stræm1ng party at least twice a week every month during the weekends to boost our v13ws so that we can reach our goals and not just every CB  Think we can make this possible? Let's keep yo eyes on the ball~ Team work makes the dream work #BTS8SongsTo1B Please spread the message
Oia big hit labels,cansei de sofrer !
100M soon!
stay health before the comeback ARMY

Just 86k to 98M!
ARMY!!! BTS's very first self-directed album 'BE' drops this Friday, November 20th at 2pm KST/12am EST.  The members were heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. This album is gonna be their most personal and intimate album so far, let's make it the most historical too!   Watch and like the two teasers of the MV of the new title track 'Life Goes On' (directed by Jungkook) ->  Teaser 1: (https://)youtu.be/Wq5S8Dt_HQE  Teaser 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3KZnCgiMW0&ab_channel=BigHitLabels  Pre-order 'BE' album here:  (https://)biglink.to/bebts  Pre-order 'Life Goes On' digital mp3 if you are a US/Puerto Rico army here:  (https://)bts-be.us/products/life-goes-on-mp3  Pre-save 'BE' album on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer to be among the first ones who can listen to the album: (https://)www.bts-be.com/  Get your free premium trials on all streaming platforms you use to make sure you won't be considered as a bot and your streams won't be filtered out/deleted. This way your streams will also weigh a lot more on the charts and you will be extremely helpful to get the boys to the #1 place on all charts. They cost nothing!  Free premium trials for different platforms (if you already had them for Dynamite comeback don't worry about it expiring, you can get another trial for free just create new accounts):  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  Apple Music: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D   Don't forget these trials are crucial for our streams, it worked last time too but we need more people to get these and all of you to keep even stronget and more consistent since we don't have the industry's help this time. (Dynamite was in English hence the support for that.)  Don't panic if the views freeze on Youtube, it happens to everyone because of the huge traffic in views. It can last for hours but views will be added back later, keep on streaming fam! Even if you see views being deleted keep streaming, views can be added back later! All we can do is go even harder whenever youtube wants to do something tricky.^^  Don't forget the number one rule: never loop/put the MV/song on repeat or autoplay anywhere! On Youtube stream manually searching the MV and other BTS videos by using the searching bar. Watch 3-4 other videos in between 'Life Goes On', avoid lyrics videos tho. Watch the audio videos of the songs from 'BE' album, bangtantv gonna upload them. They also count for the charts!  On Spotify or Apple Music use playlists and switch them frequently, about every hour. It's very important, switch them! Avoid every bot behaviours! If you can't stream aloud because you are at school, work etc just use earphones.  US/Puerto Rico armys, if you wanna buy the album/title track but don't have the money request funds from our funding accounts. Funding accounts help armys with the money of other helpful armys. You don't have to pay it back! Armys who wanna help to US/Puerto Rico armys who wanna buy the new album/title track but can't because of lack of money, you can donate to said funding accounts! Any amount is helpful.  Funding accounts for US/Puerto Rico armys ->  fundsforbangtan:  Website: (https://)www.fundsforbangtan.com/donate Twitter: (https://)twitter.com/fundsforbangtan  borahaefunds:  (https://)twitter.com/borahaefunds  usarmyfunds:  (https://)twitter.com/USARMYFUNDS  fundsforusarmys:  (https://)twitter.com/FundsForUSARMYs  Check them out and read their terms to make sure you get the funds if you request.^^  Let's work hard together to make this comeback as historical as it deserves whether with the help of western industry or not. We don't need the western industry, and contrary to what they believe BTS does NOT need an English song for us to love them and for the songs to be successful, right? Let's get all those #1s on billboard hot 100, hot 200 and all existing charts! Let's get them real awards they deserve aside from the mocking top social awards!  Let's get this fam!  In the meantime also don't forget to vote on BTS in all categories on MAMA the most prestigious Korean award show every day ->  (https://)mama.mwave.me/en/vote  Enjoy the comeback everyone, that's the most important.  Happy comeback season! 💜

Even though each device has its own IP address, all devices using home wifi will have ONE IP address. To use 2 accounts properly, use one device on cell data and one device on wifi.  Those with data limitations should watch fewer MVs at 360p than more at lower resolution.  YT deletes low quality playbacks.  Laptop users should be minimum 480p. No split screens or reduced screen sizes.

*INFO for S3rEAmI7G BTS - Life Goes On* Rules:  1. Guys don't report or interact spam coments... Couse this WILL freeze vi3ws. No spam comments.  2. Make the video QUALITY over 480p. 3. Don't skip ads/watch the m/v for ATLEAST 30 secs.  4. Like the m/v after watching it all the way through. (Only like at the end)  5. Avoid bot like behavior.  6. Don't skip the video forwards or backwards, Don't replay.  7. Turn off auto play and don't loop.  8. Watch some videos in between.  9. StreA8 with sound 10. StreA8 only on 1 device.  (Theese rules secure all the vi3ws (we must follow theese rules so that the vi3ws don't get deleted)   StreA8 properly like we did with Dynamite.   Some of the goals for Life Goes On:  Life Goes On teaser2 : 40m vi3ws on the First day.  Life Goes On M/V 105m vi3ws on the First day of the release.   Spotify: 10m Debut (When streA8ing on Spotify don't loop the song, put it in a playlist and play on Shuffle)   Be ALBUM: 60m or more.  C'mon Army we can do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just 168k to 98M....let's get it today! Reminder to new ARMYs,  expect many freezes/slow counts at Life Goes On for the first 24 hours.  This is standard YT processing of high volumes, sudden spikes in activity for new releases.  They are deleting bots, bot-like behavior and low quality playbacks.  The counter, number of likes and number of comments will not correlate at the beginning.  Ignore antis, the freeze is not caused by their spamming.  Don't engage and lose YOUR views for excessive  comments.

ARMYS LISTEN. WE ALL KNOW HOW HATERS ARE EAGER TO SPAM IN THE COMMENTS OF THE MV. LET'S DO OUR BEST TO IGNORE THEM. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT REPORT THEM AS REPORTING THE SPAM SLOWS DOWN THE VIEW COUNT. LET THEM SPAM, IT WILL HELP US GET MORE COMMENTS. FILL THE COMMENTS WILL POSITIVITY. I REQUEST YOU, PRAISE THE MV, THE PRODUCTION, THE STYLING, THE SONG ITSELF AND EVERYTHING. IGNORE HATERS AND SPREAD POSITIVITY. WE ARE ONE BIG FAMILY, WE CAN DO THIS! FIGHTING! BORAHAE!
Life goes on

Who is not tired of watching Dynamite music videos???
ATTENTION ARMY! BTS's new album, their very first self-directed album "BE" is coming this Friday, November 20th at 2pm KST/12am EST!!! The boys were heavily involved in production, composition and design too making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. It's gonna be their most personal and most intimate album so far. Let's make it the most historical too!  Pre-order the album "BE" here: (http://)biglink.to/bebts Pre-order "Life Goes On" digital single here: (https://)bts-be.us/products/life-goes-on-mp3 Pre-save BE on Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer to be among the first ones who can listen to the album: (http://)bts-be.com  We did so amazing with Dynamite fam, no comeback has ever been as successful and also joyful as that one. However that time we were supported by Columbia Records and the industry in general. Now we can not count on them since the album is not in English but in Korean. We all know how ugly the industry has been treating BTS ever since they debuted, how the western media constantly ridicule them and also us, their fandom. They see BTS as a crazy phenomenon which will disappear soon and us as mad, rapid fans. Also, the boys already mentioned their worries if they could ever reach as high with a song in Korean as they did with Dynamite. Our fandom grew so much, and we got so much stronger. Let's do this fam! Let's work hard together for the boys to get them another #1 hot 100 on billboard with the title track and even a #1 hot 200 with the album! Let's make history again! Let's show the industry BTS is here to stay whether they like it or not!  Some tips:   - Buy the album, buy the digital title track, pre-save the album. Buy the songs on iTunes, you can do that without an apple device too, just download iTunes on PC or laptop  - Don't forget to get your free premium trials on all platform where you used to stream, they are crucial. Premium accounts can not be considered as bots and the streams should be less filtered with those. It worked with Dynamite too, we must be prepared! If you already had a trial before don't worry, you can get another one for free just create another account and activate it there  - Stream correctly, don't loop, don't put anything on repeat or autoplay, be it the MV or the songs  - On Youtube don't use playlists, and watch the audio videos of the songs from "BE" which bighit will release on bangtantv. Don't watch lyrics videos (especially jaeguchi) or reaction videos in the first 24 hours. IMPORTANT: the views WILL be frozen after a while, maybe even for long hours! Don't panic! It's normal and happens to everyone, keep streaming. The views will be added later! Don't panic even if our views will be deleted, it's difficult to be monitoring such high traffic on a video, views can be added back later. "Life Goes On" MV premier starts half an hour before the MV/album drops, join in on youtube and like the video   - Don't forget to stream on Spotify and Apple Music too, streams on those platforms worth much more on the charts. You can use Apple Music without apple device, it can be used on android phone too, or even on PC/laptop  - Stream consistently and correctly without looping, use playlists on Spotify and Apple Music and switch them hourly. If you can't stream loud just use headset (at work, school etc) This is all important because what we aim for is charting high. For that we need high streams, high sales and high radio spins, but because of the industry's xenophobic and racist mindset we can't expect that part, we must make up for the lack of it by the high streams.   If we do this, if we keep streaming consistent and correct in the next weeks we can make their dream come true so they can reach high even with a Korean album/title track. We can chart them high and if we stay consistent we can secure them serious awards for the future, not just a Tops Social Artist award which award shows wanna shut us up with. This is not about a few days, this is not about records. This is about the long run, this is about cementing their name in the western industry, all around the world. Let's get this fam!  Don't forget to keep streaming Dynamite too in the meantime, the song is also part of the new album. We must keep the visibility of Dynamite since it's Grammy voting season and the song could be nominated. Grammy nominees will be announced on November 24th!

You don't have to pay it back, this is to help to armys by the help of other armys who are willing to donate to our funding accounts.

Tune in!  And most of all, enjoy the comeback fam. Streaming is literally just listening to music/watching videos, don't forget this and don't stress. Enjoy all the beautiful music and give them as much as love as the boys poured into this beautiful album.  Happy comeback season ARMY!

Guys just focus on BE realising on 20th November
Go go Bangtan
How to str@m properly  Armys don't keep on saying vi3ws and str@m ( in their correct form) This will freeze the vi3ws  And watch the ads and video fully to be counted as an view and don't keep on replaying and don't use emoji.  Don't use any other devices with same account to str@m it will not be count as a vi3w Don't skip ads watch till the end if a ad came in the end watch it to be count as vi3w  Keep it in mind  Fighting!!!!  Borahe
Be  mv is releasing on  20th November 2020

Como hacer str3am correctamente durante BE: -Buscar manualmente -Ver en pantalla grande -no quitar anuncios  -no adelantar el video ni pausar -ver con calidad de 720p -quitar subtítulos -ver cada 3 o 4 vídeos, puedes ver de otros artistas pero es mejor de BTS a los audios sobre todo eso ayuda a el hot 100 (los audios de las nuevas canciones salen en BANGTANTV, SOLO LOS BUSCAN)  -COME BIEN, DUERME BIEN UN DIA ANTES, SI SE PUEDE PRECIOSAS...
Just 3m
Can we get this to 100M before BE release...yes we can...we ARMY fighting 💪

BE tendrá solamente 19 horas de conteo para su 1er día en Spotify, por eso, para poder compensarlo 5 horas antes de que salga el álbum se planea hacer un stream masivo de Dynamite para ayudar a subir los streams del álbum. Es decir, el 19 a las 9AM KST. @BTS_twt
5 hours before BE’s release (9AM kst), we will be having a massive spotify streaming party for dynamite as those streams will count towards BE’s first day numbers. spread the word bc this will not only give us an early head start, but will also boost dynamite AND BE’s streams
Jungkook is actually too cute at 0:28 I can’ttt
3M left to 100M

Only 3M left to 100M!   Let's get it before LIFE GOES ON
4 days BEfore BE (nov 20, 2pm KST) - Buy your digital copies of LIFE GOES ON now at Bts-Be.US. Maximum 4 copies per transaction, you can buy as many times as you can. This is our road to #1 in the charts since we may not radio airplay and we are up against a monster streaming song. TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!
ARMY PLEASE VOTE DYNAMITE FOR SONG OF THE YEAR https://mama.mwave.me/en/vote BTS is nominated in 5 categories but we might lose SOTY if we don't keep voting!!!!
I'm glad there are a few BTS MVs, including this one, that will reach their first/next 100M during the comeback! It's motivating and ups the morale for everyone that's stre@ming

Como hacer str3am correctamente durante BE: -Buscar manualmente -Ver en pantalla grande -no quitar anuncios  -no adelantar el video ni pausar -ver con calidad de 720p -quitar subtítulos -no ver otros vídeos con tradiciones durante las 24hrs, pues eso canales ganan dinero -ver cada 3 o 4 vídeos, puedes ver de otros artistas pero es mejor de BTS a los audios sobre todo eso ayuda a el hot 100 (los audios de las nuevas canciones salen en BANGTANTV, SOLO LOS BUSCAN)  -COME BIEN, DUERME BIEN UN DIA ANTES, SI SE PUEDE PRECIOSAS...

아니 여긴 다 영어만 하는 사람들만 있네. 난 한국사람 이라서 한글로 해야지.방탄소년단 노래 다이나마이트를 좋아하는 사람입니다.우리나라 가수가 이렇게 좋은노래를 부르다니 너무너무 감사하고 고맙습니다.
Great song.  I wonder who the real singers are.
They are really diamonds

So fun and playful ☺️💎!!!
Jimin love
I love you BTS army
ARMY the new BTS album, their very first self-directed album "BE" drops in less than a week, on Novemer 20th Friday at 2pm KST/12 am EST! The boys were heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. It's one of the most important albums they've ever released. It's very intimate and personal, and we must support them as hard as possible to make sure it can shine the brightest and reach as high as possible.  Pre-order the new album "BE" here: (http://)biglink.to/bebts  Pre-save "BE" on Spotify, Amazon Music and Deezer to be among the first ones who can listen to the album: (http://)bts-be.com  You can also pre-order the title track "Life Goes On" on casettes. Vinyls are out of stock at the moment but keep an eye on the site, it's very likely they will be restocked: (https://)bts-be.us/  Few reminders for the comeback:  - log in to the premiere of "Life Goes On" MV on Youtube half on hour before the MV drops on ibighit's channel  - don't loop/put the MV or any of the songs on repeat on any streaming platform - stream the official audios on BangtanTV, those can trend and it will create traffic for the channel - iTunes can be used on PC/laptop, you can buy the album/songs even if you don't have apple device - Apple Music can be used on laptop and Android too, you can listen to the album there too even if you don't have apple device, but don't forget to delete the songs from your lybrary in case you buy them on iTunes or else your Apple Music streams won't be counted - there are free premium trials for all platforms, activate them on all streaming platforms you use so your streams will weigh much more  Don't forget that streaming is just listening to music/watching the MV. Streaming is crucial not only for breaking records in the first place but to chart BTS and their songs high all around the world. We wanna reach #1 everywhere and stay there or as high as possible for as long as possible. Longivity is the key and for that we need to stream smart and consistent, meaning not just for the first few days but weeks. This is not only for breaking records but mostly to shut the industry which always tries to belittle the boys, and to get them the prestigious awards they dream about and what they deserve more than anyone. For years they've been mostly nominated in awards like Top Social Artist just to shut the fandom up. To get real prestigious awards the key is to chart them high and for long. And for that what we can do is to have high streams and high sales. Radio spins we can't do much about aside from requesting the songs on local radio stations as many times as we can.  Let's get this fam, we can do it! Teamwork makes the dream work!  And most of all: enjoy the comeback everyone, that's the most important^^  PS: don't forget to vote on BTS on both MAMA and AMA awards. MAMA is the most prestigious Korean award show and AMA is the American Music Award. AMA is also important because the boys are not only nominated in two categories but are also gonna perform their new song "Life Goes On" there for the first time (on November 22nd). Let's get these too!  MAMA voting ->  (https://)mama.mwave.me/en/vote  AMA voting (Favorite Duo or Group-Pop Rock and Favorite Social Artist categories) ->  (https://)www.billboard.com/amasvote

Remember when Boy with Luv was released and the official version had very little Halsey. Then the Army version was released with more Halsey. Why does it feel like this B side is featuring Jin (giving him a little more screentime like they did with a featuring artist)?

6 sleep left ARMYS! and 'BE' is ready to topped all the chart and rankings for December and 2021!!!
ARMY GET READY! The new BTS album, their very first self-directed album "BE" drops in less than a week, on Novemer 20th Friday at 2pm KST/12 am EST! The boys were heavily involved in production, composition and design too (Taehyung worked on the photos and design of the album, and the MV is gonna be in GCF style directed by Jungkook for example) making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. It's one of the most important albums they've ever released. It's very intimate and personal, and we must support them as hard as possible to make sure it can shine the brightest and reach as high as possible.  Pre-order the new album "BE" here: (http://)biglink.to/bebts  Target has a buy 2 get 1 extra for free offer now, use this opportunity and buy three copies at the price of two albums with three of your army friends, and split the price among you so you can get it cheaper.  Amazon has a -10% offer now AND if you buy BE you also get a 3 months long free premium trial for amazon music. Use this chance to get the album for cheaper price and to be able to help more when it comes to streaming the music since streams from premium accounts weigh much more on the charts.  Pre-save "BE" on Spotify, Amazon Music and Deezer to be among the first ones who can listen to the album: (http://)bts-be.com  You can also pre-order the title track "Life Goes On" on casettes. Vinyls are out of stock at the moment but keep an eye on the site, it's very likely they will be restocked: (https://)bts-be.us/  Let's make this album historical fam! This album is very important to both the boys and to all of us. They worked very hard on it and poured all their hearts into it. However we all know how badly the industry treats them. They even voiced this lately and talked about their worries if they could ever get their songs and album as high as Dynamite in their own native language too. Dynamite was pushed very hard by Columbia Records but we can safely say it was because the song was in English. We didn't hear much about them promoting the new album so far, they rather push Dynamite even harder so we better brace ourself that Life Goes On and all the other songs will get the same ugly treatment from the industry as ON got.  So let's not let it happen! Let's go out full power in promoting and streaming/buying the songs and album so it can soar high! Let's show the boys they are loved for their music, their messages, no matter the language. That music truly transcends every barrier!  Let me tell you one thing: some people like to try to guilt trip true, dedicated armys, try to make them feel bad, to bring them down and convince them what they do as a form of support is crazy, that they only care about the numbers and records, that they ruin the art the boys are creating and they diminish their hard work into mere numbers. They even dare to say the boys don't care about the numbers or records, that they care more about us being happy for the album than us working hard on reaching high numbers. Now, do you think the boys are some martyrs? They are not human beings? That they are some higher godlike existence who don't have goals, who don't have dreams, who just live like lifeless bodies working on their art like machines and move on after releasing an album? That's how you see them after all these years? After all the messages they send us through their music? After watching all the documentaries with them suffering in the industry? After all the interviews with them where they talked about their dreams and goals? We all need feedbacks in our lives that what we do is good, that what we do is loved and we are going on the right path.  The only way for us to show them our appreciation and support is through numbers.  I was thinking these days and realized maybe some of you really just don't see the bigger picture and don't understand why many of us is pushing streaming so hard. So let me explain why streaming is important the best I can: streaming literally means listening to music or watching videos, right? It's not really about the records in the long run. Everyone who actually careas about the boys know how ugly the industry treats them, that all they ever mention is how they are just a crazy phenomenon which will disappear along with their rabid fans, but there are very few who actually talk about the deep messages of their music, or the way they helped and keep helping to so many people. They totally downplay and ridicule them, and try to sabotage them every way possible. Like how they won't give radio spins, which is one of the main factors to chart high on music charts like billboard hot 100. Western artists have this advantage without any effort, they get radio spins right away, we only get more spins for Dynamite now because it's in English and even that took a long while while western artists end up on the top of radio charts in no time. The importancy of streams is not just to break a record, records are being broken all the time. Streams are important because they are also part of the main factors of charting high. And by the way charting high for a long time leads you to be at least nominated for prestigious awards, not just for a best fan artist award the industry wanna shut the fandom up with. In the US the three main factors to chart high are streams, radio spins and sales. For sales we have amazing funding accounts to help with, who - in case you never heard of them - will fund you if you wanna buy the album/songs but don't have the money for it with the donations of other helpful armys. For streams we must work hard together. For radio spins tho we can't do anything else aside from requesting the song on our local radio stations as many times as we can and to try to cover up the lack of radio spins with our high and consistent streams and sales. And the reason why many of us keep pushing people to get free premium trials on their streaming accounts is because premium streams are weighing much more on charts than streams from free accounts.   So as you can hopefully see by now this fuss about streaming is to going against a damn industry which is trying to ruin the boys every way possible. We wanna help BTS reach impossible goals usually only western atists can - for obvious reasons. Help us with the streams, spread the word about how to do it correctly and why it is important. Let's try to pay the boys back all the love and support we always get from them and let's not let them being dragged down by the xenophope, racist music industry. The boys are just as humans as we all are and they, like we all do, also need feedbacks of what they do is good and being loved. Jimin even said he wants ALL songs of this new album to chart in billboard hot 100, and I think Yoongi mentioned it enough times already that he and all of them want a Grammy, which is, by the way, only possible with high streams and sales.  So guys let's work hard together and bring the best out of this and every comback, let's show the boys our love for them and their music, and show the industry BTS is not leaving anytime soon, they are here to stay whether they want it or not!  How to stream correctly ->   - Use premium accounts! They are crucial to not being concidered as a bot which would lead to your streams being filtered out/deleted, hence we need the free premium trials. This is our trick because who has money for premium accounts? But streams from free accounts are still better than nothing as long as they are done correctly. That is if you can't get them for whatever reasons (not having a credit card for example). If you can tho I definitely advise you to get them, just use the links I'll leave you below  - Correct streaming on platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music etc means using playlists to listen to the songs. Create short playlists with the songs from BE album, MOTS7 or Dynamite, put only 2-3 songs between the title track "Life Goes On" OR just use other armys' paylists. Switch playlists freqently about every hour, never repeat/loop any song or playlist or even the album, anything, and never mute. If you are in school, working or sleeping just use headset so you can still stream.  - Correct streaming on youtube means NOT using playlists (at least in the first 24 hours because on youtube views in playlists are counted slower and it would ruin the first 24 hours record), search the new MV "Life Goes On" manually with the searching bar, watch 3-4 other videos in between the new MV, and never put the videos on repeat. Never loop, never use autoplay and never mute or your streams will be filtered.  Links for free premium trials ->  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false AppleMusic: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/ Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D  I mentioned you our funding accounts.

BE is out in 6 days!!
"No puedo ya con esto, porque estás llorando. Quiero llorar en tu lugar, aunque no puedo. (...) Hermano, hay que llorar, llorar, llorar y superarlo. No sé mucho de tristeza, pero aún así lloraré".  - B e g i n .  Superar los obstáculos que la vida nos pone es algo por lo que todos debemos pasar. Un consejo, con esta canción es más dulce, sé fuerte, sé que puedes lograrlo, por favor, cuídate mucho :D

The AMA is on November 22nd and the Grammy nominations will be announced November 24th. So much happening in a few days only, so many historical things. It's only up to us how historical it will be. Let's make this comeback bigger than anything. The album will be the most important album so far. And let's not let the boys empty handed after the AMAs. Vote on them in both categories here:  (https://)www.billboard.com/amasvote  Pre-order the new album "BE" here: (http://)biglink.to/bebts  Target has a buy 2 get 1 extra for free offer now, use this opportunity and split the price with  3 of your army friends to get your albums much cheaper.

- versi bahasa indonesia - Halo teman - teman semua,aku ingin mengajak kalian untuk streaming bersama untuk membuat dynamite menjadi "song of the year". Dynamite adalah sebuah single dan gak punya album fisik untuk mendorong dynamite menjadi "song of the year" seperti lagu - lagu sebelumnya. Jadi aku ingin mengajak kalian semua yang membaca ikut streaming bersama di YouTube dan Spotify.  - english version - Hi friends, I want to invite you to stream together to make dynamite a "song of the year". Dynamite is a single and has no physical album to encourage dynamite became the "song of the year" like the previous songs. So I want to invite all of you who read to stream together on YouTube and Spotify.  - korean version - 안녕 친구들, 다이너마이트를 "올해의 노래"로 만들기 위해 함께 스트리밍하도록 초대하고 싶습니다. 다이너마이트는 싱글이며 다이너마이트가 "올해의 노래"가되었다고 장려하는 음반이 없습니다 이전 노래. 그래서 읽어 주신 모든 분들을 YouTube와 Spotify에서 함께 스트리밍하도록 초대하고 싶습니다.  - japanese version - こんにちは友人、私はダイナマイトを「今年の歌」にするために一緒にストリーミングするようにあなたを招待したいと思います。 ダイナマイトはシングルであり、ダイナマイトが前の曲のように「今年の曲」になったのを奨励するための物理的なアルバムはありません。 だから、YouTubeとSpotifyで一緒にストリーミングするために読んだすべての人を招待したいと思います。  - chinese version - 嗨，朋友们，我想邀请您一起直播，将炸药变成“年度歌曲”。 炸药是单曲，没有物理唱片来鼓励炸药像以前的歌曲一样成为“年度歌曲”。 因此，我想邀请所有阅读的人一起在YouTube和Spotify上进行直播。
Please help us vote this masterpiece on MAMA, thank u

Putting emojis like slows down the views or makes YouTube think that those views are fake. I'm pretty sure this is not actually true tho and that YouTube just likes deleting views because they don't like BTS. It is more of a speculation that ARMYs believe since there is nothing people could do to stop the fact that views are being deleted or slowed down. Just don't comment emojis during the first week a BTS MV comes out and comment emojis after the first week since by then most ARMYs stop mass streaming by then.  (copy n' paste this to other BTS mv)
I think they had a lot more fun with this version! I was smiling the whole way through🥰🥰

ARMY FOREVER AND ALWAYS
Armys we know that our #LifeGoesOn but we should #Be ready. We have some some dreams like we want to #FlyToTheMoon we want the powers of #Telepathy. Our life consists of some happy moments and some sad moment like #BlueAndGrey. Our life is like a #skit that God has made for us. We are just the actors of Our life. But we all have to be positive in this situation. We should fight with this #Dis_ease. And we should #Stay happy among all of these. So we should light it up like #Dynamite.
I wish they made this version the main MV

ARMYS the new BTS album, their very first self-directed album "BE" drops on November 20th Friday at 2pm KST/12am EST. Notice it's 2pm KST just like the last time, not midnight KST as in the past. This album is very important and intimate since the boys were heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. The boys put all of their hearts and souls into this monumental work and we also must work very hard to bring it as high as possible. We had crazy support with Dynamite since the song was in English but we all know how xenophobic and racist the industry works. Sadly the boys also know this, they even mentioned this not long before. They have the fear if there is that barrier after all and they won't be able to soar without the industry's heavy push. We can assume we won't get the same promo and radio support as Dynamite got. So please, let's work even harder  and show the boys, show the industry, show the whole world BTS doesn't need to change according to the industry's game, we are here for them, here for their music, here for their deep, comforting messages no matter the language. Because music transcends language and every barrier. We are here for them! Pre-order the album, pre-save it on Spotify and pre-add on Apple Music so you can be among the first ones to listen to the new songs. This way your streams will also be less filtered. If you want to lessen the chances of your streams being filtered get premium accounts on Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube etc. Streams from premium accounts weigh much more on charts so they will be extreme help for the comeback. You don't need money to get a premium account just get a free trial for a few months, they are always available and you can always get another one you just have to create another account and cancel your trial before they end.  Pre-save BE: (http://)bts-be.com Pre-order BE: (http://)biglink.to/bebts You can also pre-order the title track "Life Goes On" on casette. Vinyls are out of stock at the moment but keep an eye on the site, it's very likely they will be restocked: (https://)bts-be.us/  US Target has a buy 2 get 1 for free offer as of now, use this chance too! Talk to two of your army friends, buy 3 BE albums together and devide the price among you so you can get it for much cheaper!  Free premium trials, just click on the link and activate them on all platforms you use ->  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  AppleMusic: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D  When you stream we need very strong and consistent streams and for that we need to stream correctly and with dedication. To stream correctly what is very important is to never ever put the MV/song/album on repeat or autoplay. It's very important! While premium accounts and pre-saving the album are crucial in terms of our streams not being heavily filtered if you keep the same song or album or MV on repeat the system will consider you as bot and will filter most of your streams out. So don't do it! Best method on Spotify and Apple Music is to use short playlists which you switch frequently, about every hour. Interact with the playlists, skip or pause songs here and there, and switch playlists frequently. If you are in school, working, sleeping etc just use headset so you can still stream. On Youtube however don't use playlists! At least in the first 24 hours since views in youtube playlists are counted slower and more likely getting filtered, they would be sabotaging our first 24 hour goal - 105 Million views.  You might know the youtube channel xCeleste, she has many famous BTS videos here. She created a video about comeback goals and streaming tips, it can be very helpful, please watch it. By watching it you also help with collecting money for the comeback. Our fandom has some amazing funding accounts who would help you out if you'd like to buy the digital album/title track but don't have the money by the donations of other helpful armys. Now xCeleste will also give the complete revenue of this very video to these funding accounts to help. Watch it please, and watch it with NON premium accounts, watch the ads too, it's important. (Note: we only need premium accounts to stream official BTS MVs).  Here is her video:  (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbWvvHLiLQ&ab_channel=xCeleste  There is also a whole youtube channel created by armys who make some interesting videos and they will also give the complete revenue of ALL of their videos to funding accounts. Watch their videos too if you can, play them in the background while studing, showering, cooking etc if you are not too interested in the actual videos. Use non-premium accounts for these too, don't skip the ads.   Here is their channel: (https://)www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9Zuj9cAn5m4KVV-A7yxxw  And here is a useful video of them about how to stream correctly: (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7shgYjQo4g&ab_channel=PlanetARMY  If you are a US/Puerto Rico army who wanna buy the digital album/title track but doesnt have the money for it you can ask for funds from the following funding accounts just make sure to read their terms so you can surely get it. Click on the links and check them out ->  fundsforbangtan:  Website: (https://)www.fundsforbangtan.com/donate Twitter: (https://)twitter.com/fundsforbangtan  borahaefunds:  (https://)twitter.com/borahaefunds  usarmyfunds:  (https://)twitter.com/USARMYFUNDS  fundsforusarmys:  (https://)twitter.com/FundsForUSARMYs  Also, MAMA voting has started. It's the most prestigious Korean award show and these shows already did dirty to our boys in the past so let's make sure they get all the awards they are nominated in. For that to happen please vote on the boys in all category on the website, and keep streaming Dynamite MV on youtube. Streaming the MV is also important to keep the song high on the charts so it can be visible for Grammy voters. Grammy nominations are gonna be announced on November 24th, four days after BE comeback. This is another reason why it's extremely important to make this comeback huge and historical.  MAMA voting ->  (https://)mama.mwave.me/en/vote  The boys are going to promote the new title track "Life Goes On" on the American Music Awards (AMA) first on the November 22nd two days after its release where they are also nominated in Favorite Duo or Group-Pop Rock and Favorite Social Artist categories, make sure to vote on them there too so they won't be empty handed and their promo turns out the best.  AMA voting ->  (https://)www.billboard.com/amasvote  And let me tell you just one more thing. Don't let anyone guilt trip you and make you feel bad about wanting to support the boys and get them as high as possible. There are people who will try to tell you you are only here for the numbers and you can't enjoy the comeback ruining what the boys worked for. Don't listen to them, this is absolutely crap and they are just salty and wanna bring you down in hopes of sabotaging our comeback. Of course numbers are not everything and of course the boys create the music for us, to comfort us. But let me remind you: streaming literally means to listening to the music. All of us need feedbacks in our life that we are doing good, that what we do is not in vain and it has a reason. Numbers are not everything but believe it or not the boys do want numbers, they do wanna get high, they also do wanna reach their goals, their dreams. Yoongi said it already many times he wants to win a Grammy. That is impossible without high numbers, and high numbers are impossible without our help - since the industry is literally all about sabotaging them. They did a lot for us, the only way to pay them back for the love and comfort is to get them as high as possible. Some of you reading this are maybe baby armys or just haven't been around long enough but the boys have been sabotaged by the Korean music industry itself too since they debuted. They are where they are because of our dedication, they are here for us and we are here for them, that is why our bond and relationship is so special, stronger than any other artist has with their fans I might say. So it's all up to you what you think of this, but I advise you to not listen to this kind of negativity and don't think of comeback goals and streaming as a monotone, robotic method which ruins everything. It is just listening to the songs and wathching the MV, it should be all fun and joy.  One more last thing: don't let others to guilt trip you by telling you you are not a real fan if you don't buy BTS albums. That's not true, that's not what makes you a fan. You know your limit, what you can afford and what you can not, no one expects you, no one should force you to spend your money on things you can't afford to. You are just as valid as collectors who have everything, it does not determine how dedicated of a fan you are or how much you love the boys. I know people who buy their stuff, even go to their concerts and still throw them under the bus every chance they find and constantly complain about whatever the boys do. So please, don't let people bring you down, support the boys the best way you can. Just be there for the boys, love them, and help us with the comeback the way you can best. That's enough.  What's most important for you, for the boys, for all of us is to enjoy the comeback. Love this album and every song of it with the same love the boys created it with.   Happy comeback season everyone!

*IMPORTANT ARMYS PLEASE READ AND SHARE TO OTHER ARMYS We NEED to take the MAMA voting more seriously, I don't think everyone knows how important it is. We're currently 1st in all 5 categories but our gap is reducing everyday, and that is NOT GOOD! SO PLEASE VOTE AND VOTE EVERYDAY, or else our competitors will come out on top. Don't rely on others, TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!!!

ATTENTION ARMYS: The new BTS album, their very first self-directed album "BE" drops in 1,5 weeks, November 20th at 2pm KST/12am EST. Notice it's 2pm KST just like the last time, not midnight KST as in the past.  The album is very important and intimate since the boys were heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. Just as an example: Taehyung worked on the photos and design of the album, and the MV is gonna be in GCF style directed by Jungkook.    Pre-save BE: (http://)bts-be.com  Pre-order BE: (http://)biglink.to/bebts  You can also pre-order the title track "Life Goes On" on casette. Vinyls are out of stock at the moment but keep an eye on the site, it's very likely they will be restocked: (https://)bts-be.us/    US Target has a buy 2 get 1 for free offer as of now, use this chance too! Talk to two of your army friends, buy 3 BE albums together and devide the price among you so you can get it for much cheaper!    There gonna be eight tracks together with Dynamite, the track list has just been released by bighit. The title track we need to focus on is called Life Goes On but we will still keep pushing Dynamite too and do everything to chart all B-side tracks in the hot 100 chart and the album in hot 200. For that we all need to work together, we need to stream harder and smarter than ever, and need to keep pushing the sales too. We are hoping but can't really expect too big of a support from radio stations since the album is gonna be in Korean and we all know how xenophobic and racist the industry is. Dynamite got a huge promo because it is in English and it's very likely radio stations will try to push it more but we need to concentrate on Life Goes On. We need those high streams more than ever!    How to get prepared for the comeback and be efficient: First, get a free premium trial on every streaming platform you use. If you already had one and it expired just create another account and activate the premium trial there. Why is it important? Because premium accounts can not be considered as bots and streams from those are less filtered. Also, streams from premium accounts weigh much more on the charts so they are extremely helpful. So don't hesitate, it only takes a minute, I'm gonna link you free trials on several platforms, just click on the links and activate them.    Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false    AppleMusic: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/    Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb    Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB    Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US    Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D    Basic rules about how to stream correctly:     - on youtube what you must know is playlists are our enemies there, especially in the first 24 hours when we want to reach our goal/break our record (our goal is 105M views in the first 24 hours). Views in youtube playlists are counted slower and many times get filtered. Don't use playlists in the first 24 hours, search for the MV manually and watch it like that. Watch 2-3 other official BTS videos after and search for the MV again. Don't refresh, don't repeat, don't put the MV on autoplay, never ever loop! Don't use small screen, and never mute. Don't stream our competition (recently released MV of other artists) and don't watch lyrics videos either. Bighit always adds translations to the MVs and armys are also sharing their translations, you don't need lyrics videos. They not only steal precious views but steal money from the boys and bh too since their videos are monetized. Report them without watching and move on. Same goes to reaction videos too. Nicer reactors are respectful enough to upload their reactions the second day. Avoid the others at least in the first 24 hours, be smart. Bighit will release audio videos of all the tracks on youtube, stream those and Dynamite in between Life Goes On. That way we can not only make the tracks trend but your streams gonna be counted to the charts too      - on Spotify and Apple Music DO USE playlists! However it's important to interact with them to look less botlike. No matter how much you love a song never put it on repeat, never loop! Use your free premium trials and create your own short playlists or use other people's playlists, you can find many of them, and switch them frequently. It's important fam! Switch playlists every hour, never loop, and never mute! If you can't stream because you are in school or working or sleeping etc just plug in your headset, that way you can keep streaming. Check other prople's playlists before using them in case they were created by antis, they like to hide their fav artists' songs in them so you would accidentally stream them too. Hide all other artists' songs if you stream from big playlists like Today's Top Hits etc, don't stream our competitions anywhere.     - important thing about Apple Music which is not known by many is you can use AM even if you don't have an apple device. You can download iTunes on PC/laptop and you can download Apple Music on PC/mobile. Another important thing not many knows is if you buy a track or MV on iTunes (yes, you can buy MV too and you should if you can afford) they will automatically end up in your Apple Music library. Now you must go there and delete them from your library before you start streaming or otherwise your streams won't count there!    About buying tracks: if your own country's chart accounts don't say otherwise buy the tracks from the album separately. If you can please buy all the tracks. If you can't afford to then buy the title track "Life Goes On" at least on as many platforms as you can. Our focus is Life Goes On.    Now if you are a US/PR army who wanna buy the digital album/title track and don't have the money for it you can ask for funds from funding accounts. We have several very reliable funding accounts created by armys who help US/PR armys to buy the tracks by using donations from other helpful armys. Just read their terms carefully to make sure you get the funds.    Here are our funding accounts for US/PR armys:    fundsforbangtan:    Website: (https://)www.fundsforbangtan.com/donate  Twitter: (https://)twitter.com/fundsforbangtan    borahaefunds:    (https://)twitter.com/borahaefunds    usarmyfunds:    (https://)twitter.com/USARMYFUNDS    fundsforusarmys:    (https://)twitter.com/FundsForUSARMYs    If you are no US/PR army but wanna help them with the sales and reaching our goals on the charts you can send money to these funding accounts.   If you wanna help but don't have the money for it you can still help! There is a whole new youtube account created by armys, PlanetARMY,  who give all revenue from their videos to funding accounts. You just have to watch their videos to help. The more views the better so spread them to other armys. Warning! While we need the premium accounts for streaming BTS, in this case use a non premium youtube account. Premium accounts don't get ads on youtube, but these youtube accounts get their money mostly by viewers watching ads. So watch all short ads and skip the long ones after 30 seconds. But don't forget, this is only for these videos. When you stream BTS MVs we NEED the premium accounts!    Here is their youtube channel: (https://)www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9Zuj9cAn5m4KVV-A7yxxw    Here is a useful video of them about how to stream correctly: (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7shgYjQo4g&ab_channel=PlanetARMY    You most probably know xCeleste too, her videos of BTS are very famous on youtube. She also created a video which's complet revenue she will send to our funding accounts. Watch her video again with a non premium account, also share it with other armys so it can reach more: (https://)www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbWvvHLiLQ&ab_channel=xCeleste    Here you can find more information about comeback goals in different countries:  (https://)beiscoming.com/be-goals/    And lastly: don't forget to vote on BTS on MAMA, it's the most prestigious Korean award show. We must make sure they win all the awards, we saw some ugly things these shows pulled on them in the past so let's don't give them a chance to do something tricky.    (https://)mama.mwave.me/en/vote    The boys are gonna promote the new song "Life Goes On" on the American Music Awards (AMA) first where they are also nominated in Favorite Duo or Group-Pop Rock and Favorite Social Artist categories, make sure to vote on them there too so they won't be empty handed and their promo turns out to be the best. Here you can vote:  (https://)www.billboard.com/amasvote    This album is so important, so intimate and meaningful, no album has ever been this monumental so let's make it historical! Yoongi can't take part in the promotions because of his serious shoulder surgery he just went through sadly, it must be very devastating for him after working so hard and putting all their hearts into this beautiful masterpiece. The boys also expressed their fears and sadness of the unfair treatment of the industry towards them and wondered if they can ever break records with songs in their native language too and not just in English. Jimin also said one of his wishes is to land all tracks of the new album on billboard hot 100.    Let's do this fam! Let's do this for the boys, let's make them happy, let's show them language is no barrier! Teamwork makes the dream work! Spread these rules, tips, infos too with as many armys as you can and on as many platforms as you can, many are still unaware even of the comback. It's on literally next Friday! We can do this!    And most of all: enjoy the comeback and all the new, beautiful music the boys are blessing us with.    Borahae~

*Dear HATER:* Your disrespectful comments won't take away BTS's money, fame, or achievements, much less happiness. ♡ *You just waste your time* LMAO  *Querido Hater,* Tus comentarios irrespetuosos no le quitarán a BTS su dinero, fama o sus logros, mucho menos su *FELICIDAD* ♡ *Así que sólo estás perdiendo tu tiempo* JAJAJAJA

hi
100M VAMOS
Seventeenth time to stream AND comment on  this MV since 6 Oct 2020. This is the funniest, most enjoyable B-side MV I ever saw!
❤❤❤
my best of favorite song
ARMY, the new BTS album, their first ever self-directed album "BE" is dropping on November 20 at 2pm KST/12am EST. This is their most important and intimate comeback so far, the boys are heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. Just as an example Taehyung works on the photos and design of the album, and the MV is gonna be in GCF style directed by Jungkook.  The album is gonna be in Korean which will make it difficult to reach our goals. We did an outstanding job to break all records with Dynamite but the song was in English hence we had all the promotion. However even the members expressed they can feel the unfair way music industry is treating them and they told us their wishes and fears if they can chart a Korean album just as high. Let's do it for the boys, let's work hard together on the comeback to reach even higher and show them how music really transcends languages and there are no barriers to enjoy good music especially if it has an important message. Let's also break those records for Yoongi who just has been through a serious shoulder surgery and can't participate in the promotion of the album they worked so hard on and put all their hearts into. Let's ease his mind and make him and all the members happy!  Pre-order BE: (http://)biglink.to/bebts Pre-save BE: (http://)bts-be.com  Some tips to stream in an efficient way:  #1 thing you can do is to get a premium account on all streaming platforms by a free premium trial. Why are they important? Premium accounts can not be considered as bots hence streams from those will less likely filtered. Also, streams from premium accounts weigh much more than from non premium accounts. So don't hesitate and activate the free trials, I'm gonna link you some below. If you had one for Dynamite comeback (many of us activated one back then) it's most probably expired since then or will soon. No problem, just create another account and activate the free trial there too. You can do this in the future as many times as you want.   Free premium trials, just click on the link and activate them (delete the brackets):  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  AppleMusic: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D  How to stream on Youtube correctly: first, get your free premium trial through the link above. Don't use playlists in the first 24 hours ever! Even better if on the first week or at all. Views in playlists are counted slower so they very much affect our first 24 hour record (105M views) and more likely get filtered. Let's not repeat the ON case, it was devastating to watch. Also, never ever loop! Be it an MV or song on other platforms, never loop, never put them on repeat, never put them on autoplay! No matter how much you enjoy the song your streams will be filtered. Also don't stream on small screen, and don't mute the MV. Stream manually, search the MV in the searching bar, watch 2-3 other preferably BTS videos after (bighit will most probably upload all tracks from BE as audio videos, stream those), then search for and watch the MV again. If you really can't stream like that rather put the videos in a queue than using playlists.  How to stream correctly on Spotify: first, get your free premium trial through the link above. Use playlists! Make them short with 2-3 songs in between the title track "Life Goes On", preferably songs from BE or MOTS7 albums or Dynamite. If you stream from other armys' playlists check them out beforehand in case they were actually created by antis, they used to hide their favs' music in the playlists so we would give them accidental streams. Don't ever stream our competitions (recently released songs of other artists) no matter how much you like them. If you are an army know that streaming others is self-sabotage during comeback. Concentrate on BTS please. Another thing is to interact with your playlists. Switch them frequently, about every hour, pause or skip some songs here and there to look less botlike. And never ever loop! Never repeat a song, never put on autoplay! Also don't mute!  How to stream correctly on Apple Music: first of all what many don't know is you can stream on AM even if you don't have an apple device, just download it on your android. Same goes for iTunes. You can buy the tracks and MV (yes, MV too) on iTunes even if you don't have the device for it as long as iTunes is available in your country. Just download the app on your PC/laptop. So. Get the AM account, activate the free trail through the link above and log in to your iTunes.  Another thing many don't know about AM is if you bought a song or MV on iTunes it's gonna end up in your AM library and if you stream things which are already there your streams won't be counted. So what you need to do if you buy the tracks and/or MV on iTunes is to go to your AM library and delete them from there. That's all. Just delete from library after buying them and your streams will be counted! Now AM playlists should look a bit different from Spotify. On Spotify you should put more songs between the title track. On AM the less the better. 1 max 2 songs are enough. Interact with your playlists, switch them every hour, pause and skip songs here and there.  Here too if you stream from others' playlists which is the easiest way check them beforehand to make sure not to stream our competitions. Don't loop, don't put the songs or MV on repeat ever! No matter which platform you use. And don't mute!  If you are at school, are working or sleeping just use headset so no one can hear you streaming. But again, never mute.  Also, please ignore lyric videos, they are stealing our views, some not only stealing views but even get money for it basically even stealing money from our boys (khhmmmm jaeguchi khhhhmmmmm). If you see lyrics videos please report them without watching and keep streaming official videos from ibighit or bangtantv.  Another thing. If you are a US/PR army who wanna buy the digital album and/or title track but don't have the money you can ask for funds from funding accounts. They are helping out US/PR armys with the donations of other armys to be able to reach our goals. If you are not a US/PR army but would like to help them out with buying the album/title track and get the #1 hot 100 and #1 hot 200 on Billboard chart you can donate to those funding accounts.  Links for funding accounts:  fundsforbangtan:  Website: (https://)www.fundsforbangtan.com/donate Twitter: (https://)twitter.com/fundsforbangtan  borahaefunds:  (https://)twitter.com/borahaefunds  usarmyfunds:  (https://)twitter.com/USARMYFUNDS  fundsforusarmys:  (https://)twitter.com/FundsForUSARMYs  These are all very reliable accounts. Just read their terms carefully to make sure you get the funds.  Lastly here is a survey. It was made by an army and it is to see how well-prepared the fandom is about the comeback. It takes only 2-3 minutes to fill out and is very fun and useful. You can surely see it yourself too if you are aware of everything. Never too late to catch up, we still have 1,5 week. Make sure to fill out the survey and send it to other armys too. Let's make the best out of this comeback fam!  (https://)docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6-xXWdzKmZPmu3EUeM-ctV6uUfmCArQKdbgis21NO-KIQ3w/viewform  And most of all: enjoy the comeback. This is gonna be the most beautiful and meaningful comeback so far, let's make sure it's gonna be the most historical one, too.  Teamwork makes the dream work!

Kim SeokJin deserves every spotlight there is. He is so sincere in everything he does and it shines thru his smile and the fact that he is so adorably handsome. I love him among all the BTS members.
I guess Michael Jackson would love to be in that video.

Wow, hadn't heard this one before!  Really wondering what u guys think of our 'slighty heavier' version of this awesome song ;)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8upxsenXQ
Voy a encenderla como dynamite ahh
The elegance, simplicity and splendor of the Hawassa sound ↖️↖️↖️↖️↖️↖️
OMG OMG WE ARE GETTING A NEW ALBUM SOON HELLLO? AKJNSJDSJK I CANT WAIT!!!
Aviso muy importante   Teniendo en cuenta que BTS está a nada de dejar de ser el artista más transmitido en Youtube, es importante que se unan a un proyecto del cual se había avisado antes, consiste en hacer que BTS sea el PRIMER y ÚNICO ARTISTA con más MVS con 1B de vistas, esto sería como regalo de fin de año de ARMY para los chicos, este proyecto consiste en que 1M de ARMYS reproduzcan:  7 veces Dynamite  1 vez Boy With Luv  3 veces Fake Love  3 veces Idol  3 veces Mic Drop
I miss Suga
Los amo con toda mi vida lo digo enserio los amo

*12 Days Until 'BE'!*
Jin has some crazy Visuals .  Not even kidding
I love the B side more than the MV😂😂
BTS's new album, their first ever self-directed album "BE" is coming on the 20th November at 2pm KST/12am EST. The boys are heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. Last time we did an outstanding job breaking all records with Dynamite, let's repeat it with this very important and intimate album.  Our youtube goal is 105 Million views in the first 24 hours and 250 Million by the end of the week. Some streaming tips on all platforms to make sure we bring the best out of us and reach all of our goals: The #1 thing we need to make all armys familiar with is owning a premium account. Not many can afford a premium account but that is okay since that is what free premium trials are for. All you need to do is activate a trial be it on Youtube, Spoitfy, Apple Music etc. If you alredy got one for Dynamite it most probably expired since then or about to soon. No problem, you just need to create another account and activate the trial there too. Why are premium accounts so important? Streams from a premium account not only weigh more but since it's a premium account you can not be considered a bot and your streams will less likely be filtered. It is extremely important to get premium accounts so spread the word and make more people to get one for the come back. It doesn't take much time and costs absolutely nothing with a free trial but it makes a huuuuge difference when it comes to streams. Many got the trials for Dynamite comeback and look at the numbers we reached! We broke all of our goals. That's how impactful it is! Now some tips for youtube streams: aside from having a premim account it's important not to use playlists on this platform! Search the MV manually, watch it, watch other videos in between - bighit will most probably upload B-side tracks from the album on youtube so best if you watch those and Dynamite MV - then watch the new MV again. If you are busy and can't stream manually better put the videos in a queue than using playlists. Youtube counts views slower in playlists and also more likely filters them out so it's better to avoid it especially the first 24 hours but even better the first week since that perioud is the most crucial. Also never repeat a video, don't use autoplay, don't loop. Never ever loop on any platform! Your streams will be filtered then. Spotify and Apple Music tips: what many don't know about AM or iTunes is that you can use these even if you don't have apple device, all you need is to download the app on your PC/laptop. That way you can buy the song and MV (yes, the MV too) on iTunes and then stream it on PC or even on your android phone. AM works on android! What's also very important and many don't know is if you buy a song on iTunes it automatically ends up in your AM library and streams of songs which are in your library won't be counted. So what you must do after buying the title song and MV on iTunes is go to your Apple Music library and delete them from there. After that all your streams will count. On these platforms do USE playlists! But you need to use them correctly in order for your streams to not get filtered. First of all again most important is to get a premium account, can be via a free trial. After that either create your own playlist or use other armys playlists but in that case check them out beforehand. Antis like to create fake playlists where they hide their fav artists' songs between BTS songs so you would accidentally stream them. Also if you stream from big playlists like Today's Top Hits for example make sure to hide other songs so you won't give other artists streams. If you are a 100% army don't stream our competition (recently released songs of other artists) even if you love them too, that would be self sabotage.  Now Spotify and Apple Music works a bit differently. On Spotify you need to put more songs in between the title track "Life Goes On" or else you can be considered bot and your streams will be easily filtered. Put 2 or rather 3 songs in between, from the new album BE and MOTS7, and also Dynamite of course. On apple put only 1 or max 2 songs in between, again either songs from BE and MOTS7 or Dynamite. It's very likely Dynamite will be on BE, also MOTS7 and Dynamite are nominated for Grammys and MAMA so we are still working hard on those too. Another very important thing about streaming on Spotify and Apple Music: don't! loop! As I already mentioned before looping/puting a song on repeat/autoplay gets the streams filtered out. It's understandable if you are addicted to the new songs but please stream correctly to make your streaming efficient. What you can also help a lot to get you look less botlike with is interacting with your playlists, meaning pausing, skipping songs here and there. And also very important: switch playlists frequently! Don't make them too long and switch them every hour at least. If you are working or in school just use headset so no one can hear you listenintg to the songs and keep streaming. So to sum it up: use free premium trails to stream from premium accounts, use playlists - except on youtube - , and don't loop/put songs on repeat anywhere! These are the most important rules. If you got to this part congratulations, i admire you. Please let other armys know about these methods too, you can help a lot with that since many still don't even know about the comeback let alone how to stream correctly. Last time we did an amazing job with Dynamite, I know we can repeat it. Do it for the boys, do it for Yoongi too who can't take part in the promotions of BE because of his serious shoulder surgery. Let's make him and the other boys happy by breaking records and reaching our goals again as a payback.  Let's work hard together and most of all: happy comeback season fam!  Here are some useful links for you (delete the brackets).  Pre-order BE: (http://)biglink.to/bebts Pre-save BE: (http://)bts-be.com   Free trials if you need, you just have to activate them:  Spotify: (https://)www.spotify.com/us/premium/?checkout=false  AppleMusic: (https://)www.apple.com/apple-music/  Pandora: pdora.co/2PEG6Lb  Deezer: (https://)www.deezer.com/us/?origin=Adwords&utm_campaign=acq-Adwords_Brand_Free&utm_content=homepage&utm_medium=search-obj_sub&utm_source=adwords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvb75BRD1ARIsAP6LcqtXkTfGGjq06IfvoRfM8PPUqmnr9NRh79ykjGCva99uAtrw8enB5AEaAqg0EALw_wcB  Tidal: (https://)offer.tidal.com/?geo=US  Youtube: (https://)www.youtube.com/premium?ybp=OgIIEEoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZA%253D%253D   Funding accounts for US/PR armys who don't have the money to buy the digital album/title track but would like to, these accounts will help you out with money donated by other armys:  fundsforbangtan:  Website: (https://)www.fundsforbangtan.com/donate Twitter: (https://)twitter.com/fundsforbangtan  borahaefunds:  (https://)twitter.com/borahaefunds  Fighting ARMY!

세상에 너무 다이나마이트
むらさきします💜🥺
BTS vino de una pequeña empresa, empezaron sin nada. Jin, quien fue expulsado solo por su apariencia, Suga, quien dejó a su familia y apostó su educación solo para hacer lo que realmente quería ser, Namjoon que nunca fue apoyado por sus padres, Jimin que se creía feo y gordo, Taehyung que siempre formó parte de BTS pero nunca se mostró en ninguna promoción, no hasta el debut, Hoseok, que siempre parecía reír, pero nunca se sintió como un logro para su padre y Jungkook, quien era muy tímido y había salvado a sus padres a temprana edad mediante una audición a empresas. ¿Recuerdas los días en que estaban luchando? ¿Incluso tuvieron que sacrificarse y trabajar duro para poder comer? Se estaban apretando en un pequeño apartamento y tuvieron que asumir responsabilidades, la razón por la que escribieron la canción "move" Esos momentos en que Jimin tiene que morirse de hambre solo porque la gente lo llama gordo y feo. Esa entrevista donde Yoongi dijo eso; fue agradable que la gente escuchara su música porque Taehyung y Jungkook son guapos. Y pensó que al menos era suficiente. ¿Te acuerdas de cuando se suponía que Hoseok era el vocalista y Taehyung el rapero, pero en su lugar eligió el rap y aprenderlo porque Taehyung quería ser el vocalista? Era el sueño de Taehyungs y Hoseok ama su dongsaeng que tanto sacrificaría. Otros fanáticos los acusaban de plagio solo porque tenían el más mínimo detalle, lo mismo con otros grandes grupos de Kpop, que en realidad era solo una coincidencia. Hubo un momento en que Yoongi empacó 300 regalos y cartas solo para darles a sus 300 fanáticos que asistirán a sus mini reuniones de fanáticos. Entonces, ¿por qué las personas los juzgan tan rápido? ¿Sabías que Jimin llegó hasta Seúl desde Busan solo para perseguir sus sueños? ¿Sabías que Taehyung vivió con su abuela durante casi la mitad de su vida haciéndolo inocente de todo lo que hay en nuestro mundo? ¿Sabías que Jungkook dejó de lado su vergüenza solo para satisfacer las expectativas del otro? Sí, él es el maknae Dorado, pero también sufre cuando ve que sus hyungs están teniendo dificultades, llora. Y hubo un momento en que Jimin lo atrapó llorando y la razón fue porque extrañaba a su familia. Jungkook a menudo llora en secreto para que sus hyungs no se preocupen. ¿Sabías que Jin hizo una audición para hacer que su madre se enorgulleciera de él y para que su madre tuviera algo de qué presumir ante esos vecinos críticos que tenían? Trabajó duro en su voz, pero la gente lo llamó sin talento. ¿Sabías que Namjoon trabajó duro solo para producir canciones pero hubo un momento en que su madre arruinó su computadora y rompió su micrófono para que pudiera concentrarse en estudiar? ¿Sabías que Hoseok audicionó porque quería que su padre estuviera orgulloso de él? ¿Porque sintió que era una decepción? Esos días de novatos en los que solo escucharon los premios y se sorprendieron de sus mayores. No pudieron hacer nada más que observar a los ídolos que recibieron los premios. Estaban contentos. Y ahora llegaron a la cima y se volvieron más exitosos. De 150 aficionados a 6 mil y contando, De una pequeña sala de práctica a una más grande. Desde un dormitorio estrecho con compañeros de cuarto a un dormitorio grande, cada uno de ellos era un cuarto, Desde un premio Daesang hasta más premios e incluso han ganado en BBMA. BTS nunca esperó esto antes de su cuarto año de aniversario, han llegado tan lejos, hasta el momento que la única posibilidad que tenemos de verlos es ir a su concierto (NUNCA O TAL VEZ SI,DESPUÉS DE TODO SOMOS ARMYS :') Encuéntralos en la calle con un 0.01% de probabilidad. Pero realmente ARMYS✨ !! ¡Hemos llegado hasta aquí, queridos, amémoslos y brindémosles nuestro apoyo hasta el final! Quería agradecerles a todos. Te amo BTS! Permanezcamos juntos hasta el final. Si crees en lo que he dicho. Si crees en 1! 2! 3! @imzg ^^ obtuve esto de otra persona que lo consiguió de otra persona difundir para mostrar que nuestros bebes son muy fuertes aunque ,eso ya lo sabemos I PURPLE U💜💜💜💜 army recuerda esto like si piensas igual que yo.
LOVE bts

I just vote for BTS and IU-Suga collab and return to stream.  I am now stealing other family members' phone for a few minutes to vote. 😋😋😋 And my friends are bound to vote or else they are gonna have it😁
Man I really cracked up at 1:31 when Yoongi throws the ball backward, misses the basket and still raises his arms like "I'm the king! I'm the boss."

💜💜💜💜
@ BTS Y. ARMI
The new BTS album, their first ever self-directed album "BE" is coming on the 20th November at 2pm KST/Midnight EST. The boys are heavily involved in production, composition and design making it the most "BTS-esque" music yet. Last time we did an outstanding job breaking all records with Dynamite, let's repeat it with this very important and intimate album.   Our goal is 105 Million views on Youtube in the first 24 hours and 250 Million by the end of the week. As always it is very important to have premium accounts on all streaming platforms to avoid being considered a bot and your streams being deleted. It clearly worked last time and it's even more important to do the same this time. No album has been as important as this one before. If your free premium trials have expired since Dynamite it's all fine, all you need to do is create another account and get your free premium trials for that. Gonna leave some links for free premium trials on different streaming platforms under this text. Please get them before the comeback and spread the word. Very important: spread the word on social media with as many people as you can, many still unaware sadly.   Another important thing is: stream smart instead of stream hard. Use playlists on Spotify and Apple Music, avoid putting our competitions (recently released music) in the playlists, even hide such artists so you won't accidentally stream them when using big playlists like Today's Top Hits for example. Very important to switch your playlists frequently otherwise your streams will be filtered. Stream even when you are in school, at work, are asleep using a pair of headset so no one can hear it. Also very important: on Youtube do NOT use playlists! Views in playlists are usually filtered and even counted slower meaning they will be very damaging to use especially in the first 24 hours. Stream manually on youtube, search the MV manually, watch it, watch a few other videos then search for the MV again and so on. If you wanna stream while sleeping or working rather put the MV on a queue. You can put it as many time as you want just put other videos in between, too. It's more efficient than playlists.  Lastly, don't forget: use shazam to search for the song. Shazaming helps with radio spins. The more shazam the more recognized the song is gonna be by radio stations and the more spins they will get. So far it seems like Columbia Records is rather pushing Dynamite, it's possible the new album/single is gonna get the same ugly treatment as ON has gotten since it's gonna be in Korean unlike Dynamite was. We can not let the same happening to this meaningful album so we have to stream, buy and shazam extra hard. Once the album and title song are released buy them on every platform you can especially iTunes. If you are US/PR army and have no money for it you can always ask for funds from funding accounts such as fundsforbangtan and borahaefunds. Gonna leave links below. If you are no US/PR army but wanna help them buy the song on iTunes so we can break more records and get the #1 Hot 100 with the title song and #1 Hot 200 with the album you can always send donations to the same accounts which they will use to funds US/PR armys with.   As you all must know by now Yoongy went through a serious surgery because of his shoulder which he broke before their debut in 2012 and got in a much worse condition ever since. He was pushing through the pain and working hard on this come back but doctors told him the best he can do is if he gets through the surgery now. So sadly he can not take part in the promotions of BE. We all must understant how devastating this must be to him especially after putting all their hearts and feelings into this album. So let's make it the most succesful BTS album so far! Let's work hard together to pay the boys back all the love and joy we got from them, to pay back all the hard work they put into it!

BTS army songs like 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now this is the reason why I love BTS so much: please do take time to read this: Ahem..... BTS came from a small company, they started with nothing. Jin who was casted just because of his looks, Suga who left his family and gambled his education just to do what he really wanted to be, Namjoon who was never have been supported by his parents, Jimin who thought himself as ugly and fat, Taehyung whose always been part of BTS but was never shown in any promotions- not until they debut, Hoseok who seemed to always laugh but never felt as an accomplishment to his father, And Jungkook who was very shy and have saved his parents at a young age by auditioning to companies. Remember the days when they were struggling? They even have to sacrifice and work hard just so they could eat? They were squeezing themselves into one small apartment and have to take responsibilities- the reason why they wrote the song 'Move'. Those times when Jimin has to starve himself just because people calls him fat and ugly. That one interview where Yoongi said that; it was nice that people listens to their music because Taehyung and Jungkook are good looking. And he thought that it was at least enough. Do you remember when Hoseok was supposed to be the vocalist and Taehyung is the rapper, but he chose to rap instead and learn it because Taehyung wants to be a Vocalist. It was Taehyung's dream and Hoseok loves his dongsaeng that much he would sacrifice. Other fan base were accusing them for plagiarism just because they had the smallest detail whose the same with other big K-pop group which is actually just a coincidence. There was a time when Yoongi packed 300 gifts and letters just to give to their 300 fans who will attend at their mini fan meetings. So why do people judge them so fastly? Did you know that Jimin came all the way to Seoul from Busan just to persuade his dreams? Did you know that Taehyung lived with his grandma gor almost half of his life making him innocent from what else is out there in our world? Did you know that Jungkook set aside his embarrassment just to meet the others expectations? Yes, he is the golden maknae, but he suffers too when he see his hyungs having a hard time, he cries. And there was a time when Jimin caught him crying and the reason is because he misses his family. Jungkook often cry secretly so that his hyungs wouldn't worry. Did you know that Jin auditioned to make his mother proud of him and so that his mom would have something to brag off to those judgmental neighbors they have. He worked hard on his vocals yet people called him talentless. Did you know that Namjoon worked hard just to produce songs yet there was a time when his mom ruined his computer and broke his mike so he could focus on studying? Did you know that Hoseok auditioned because he wanted his father to be proud of him? Because he felt like he was a disappointment? Those rookie days where they only listen to the awardings and be amazed by their seniors. They can't do anything but to watch those idols who receives the awards. The days when they were happy with just 300 views on YouTube, mini fangatherings, small numbers of followers, and one Daesang award. They were contented. And now they've reached to the top and became more successful. From 150 fans to 6M and counting, From a small practice room to a bigger one, From cramped dorm with roommates to big dorm with each of them having a room, From one daesang award to more awards and they've even won on BBMAs. HRS never expected this before their fourth year anniversary, they've come so far- so far that the only chance we have to see them is to go to their concertor (NEVER) meet them along the street with 0.01% chance. But really ARMYs! We've came this far fam, let's love them and give them our support till the end! I wanted to thank y'all. I love you fam! I love BTS. Let's stay together until the end. If you believe in what I've said. If you believe in 1! 2! 3! Just spreading the message😌😔😇😇

진은 말 그대로 모든 것을 잘한다. 그의 목소리는 놀랍다 그는 나를 기분 좋게 만들 수 있습니다. 그는 요리 할 수 ​​있습니다 그의 춤은 말 그대로 완벽 해 그의 비주얼은 너무 아름다워 그는 전 세계적으로 잘 생겼고 전세계 귀염둥이 남자         그는 믿을 수 없다

SUGA'S HEALTH INFORMATION   SUGA underwent surgery to repair his torn shoulder labrum on November 3. The surgery, to address a problem that had constantly been a health and wellness issue for SUGA, was completed successfully and he is currently resting and recovering following his physicians advice that SUGA must undergo a strict and unhindered period of recovery.  As many fans know, SUGA has long suffered from shoulder-related health issues. SUGA's shoulder issues began when he was injured in an accident that occured in 2012 before his debut, and he was diagnosed with a dislocated shoulder in 2013. Shoulder pains continued until he was further diagnosed in 2019 with "posterior labral tear of his left shoulder", which means that the cartilage around his left shoulder joint has been torn. Since then, he has continued to receive various treatment to prevent his injury from affecting his activities.  SUGA has long suffered from a wide range of symptoms including the inability to raise his arms high and sudden bouts of pain. He underwent constant rehabilitation and treatment during his career, but unfortunately his symptoms did not improve measurably. These symptoms have appeared with increasing frequency in recent years, affecting SUGA not only on the stage but in the course of his daily life as well.  SUGA also felt that it was important for him to restore himself to good health to prepare for his mandatory military service as well as his post service musical career. After extensive discussion with the company, the decision was made to undergo the surgical procedure,  Following the surgery, SUGA will be unable to participate in most official activities so that he may fully focus on his recovery. Once doctors determine that the site of the operation has healed sufficiently, SUGA will begin physical therapy so that he can ultimately return to the stage healthy and fully recovered.  #GetWellSoonYoongi ♡  Now ARMY We have to Make this Comeback a BLOCKBUSTER   *ATTENTION ARMYS* 👇 CONFIRMED "BE" GOALS ARE HERE:  *BTS "BE" COMEBACK GOALS* *(20 NOVEMBER 2020)* *(12 AM ET  /  2PM KST)*  ■ *7 Million Album Sales Worldwide*  •Billboard• ▪︎ *700,000 Album Units (SPS)* ▪︎ *150,000 Title Track Sales*  •#1 on Billboard 200 •#1 on Billboard Hot 100 (Title Track) _(ALL ALBUM SONGS IN BILLBOARD HOT 100)_ •#1 on Billboard Global 200 •#1 on Billboard Global Excl US •#1 on Billboard Artist 100  •YouTube• •4M in YT mv Premier  •105M in 24 hours •9M Likes in 24 hours •230M in First week  *(MUST KEEP IN MIND)* ●  If Possible try to Use *YT Premium* it will not delete views from mv. ● Don't Loop the mv ● Watch the mv in 480p or more ● Don't Use Playlist for First day ●Watch 3-4 videos before coming back to mv. ●Don't  report spam comments fastly because if we'll report more then YT will freeze because of soo many reports about spAm from mv and Lastly WILL DELETE VIEWS.

Anygays or I mean ANYWAys Dynamite B-Side is close to 100M so keep stream ARMY I love this one Bc it’s a b-side and it’s funny, playfull and we get to see BTS goofy in so long :’(
Here's my 'Dynamite' and basically my 'Army' story. I was so down, we just brought my youngest son at the hospital because of seizures and after a couple of weeks I found out that I was positive of Corona (asymptomatic btw but still). Had to be brought to an isolation facility and stay there for a couple of weeks. We had a huge debt because of the bills and I was all alone and worried about my other kids. There's no time of the day that I didn't cried, was even thinking about ending it all. And then one day, I turned to our local music station and saw the MV of BTS' Dynamite I was blown away. The vibes just sunk into me, and I cried again but not because of depression but because of hope. That all will be well. Now I'm all okay and so is my kid.  And to the boys, thank you for bringing good vibes for someone who has chosen to give up. Borahae!  Edit: I also draw Jungkook, he's my bias. I posted it on my Insta and Twitter.
I don't like bts

ARMYS PLEASE READ AND SPREAD TO OTHER ARMYS: https://mama.mwave.me/en/vote We need to take the MAMA voting more seriously, I don't think everyone knows how important it is. We're currently 1st in all 5 categories but our gap is reducing everyday, and that is NOT GOOD! So PLEASE VOTE AND VOTE EVERYDAY, or else our competitors will come out on top. Don't rely on others, TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!!!
This is blooper right?

Amo a Jimin like si tu también lo amas
Todos hablan de hacer stream a todos los videos de BTS pero si saben que TxT casi ni tiene apoyo, sus videos no pasan de los 100 millones excepto Crown, si somos armys, por lo menos debemos de apoyar a los dos grupos, ser generos@s ya que muchos grupos quisieran tener el reconocimiento que BTS logro tener. Armys apoyémonos,  y verán que lograremos mucho tod@s junt@s en la industria del Kpop. Solo es mi opinión......
VAMOS ARMY POR MAS!!!!!!  NO 3moj1s pliss
OMG VAMOS 100M.
LIFE GOES ON  20th November
Hey you don't look at the comments look up at the screen at bts dancing
The first time I saw their bts videos I loved they do a nice job because they got ahead when they had problems that's why I love bts because they never give up and achieve all their goals each of the members are very special to me because they show their talents the public are so great the bts 🤩❤️❤️❤️
love you
BE is coming in 2 weeks pre order at target

No se pero espero no ser la unica que vio en el minuto 0:10 se ve pasar una sombra rapido en la ventana inferior derecha no la que esta junto A Jungkook si no la otra ventana de la puerta derecha  Bueno a lo mejor no se si es Unos de los trabajadores Del video , pero lo que. Me llama mucho la atencion esque como pasa la sombra muy rapido yo no miento si , quieren repitan el video unas Cuantas veces  o tal vez sea algun efecto del lente de la camara o no se yo pero enserio paro hay algo y tengo  Un mal presentimiento sobre lo que vi ..... a pesar de que lo que estube viendolo una y otra vez para mi hay algo para normal o ustedes que piensan ???

안녕하세요, 잘 지내세요? 방탄 소년단의 음악 없이는 결코 잊지 못할 것이라는 작은 메시지를 보내고 싶어요, 너무 지루했지만 이제는 그들의 음악에 대한 행복으로 가득 찬 세상을 느끼고 기쁨으로 가득 차 있지만 그게 제가 말하고 싶은 전부가 아니기 때문입니다. 이 검역이 끝나면 베네수엘라에서 콘서트를 보길 바랍니다. 라틴계가 콘서트를하길 바라는 유일한 군대가 아니라 슬픈 군대가 너무 많아서 그 나라를 향해 콘서트를하길 원하기 때문입니다. 일부 군대는 희망이 너무 많아서 여러분이 좋아하는 가수를 볼 수 있다는 것과 저와 제 친구들이 군대가되어 매우 기쁘고 여러분을 만날 수 있다는 희망에 행복하다는 것을 여러분에게 말하고 싶습니다 I love you 방탄 소년단 언젠가 여러분을 알게 될 것입니다 여러분 모두 똑같이 사랑합니다 여러분들 중 일부가 볼 수 있기를 바랍니다 이 메시지를 이해하고 사랑해 방탄 소년단

Here's your daily gentle reminder to vote for our boys in MAMA in all the 6 categories (5 BTS + 1 Suga/IU collab). ^^ Link: mama.mwave.me/en/vote Take care of yourself, ami. <3

2:40 I didn't even notice the imaginary sanitizer bottle Jungkook squirted into his hand
6,6M → 7M likes
91M → 100M
MERCI BTS MERCI
the best song everrrr ;)
Bts run 114 English/Spanish https://youtu.be/pUrYi1N31uI
Son unos bebés hermosos
I love how they dance in the Michel Jeckson style
공식뮤비에 노홍철 왜 안나오나 계속 찾았더니 여기 B컷 뮤비에 있는거였네ㅋㅋ
Que divertido
V last part is so funny
I think I like Taehyungs end in this video more than in the original. He just looks so damn fine in that green suit with his hair slicked back. And the way he ends it funny with a ‘pow’ just like Jimin started it.
Guys lets 1 B
8.4M left to reach 100M
Estou apaixonada nessa música
Jungkook like kid😆😆
ARMY: please keep str3aming Dynamite all official videos. We are gaining 3.4M daily (below our goal of 4M). Remember the vi3ws are the only tool we got now to keep Dynamite afloat. Also is voting season in Korea and views are very important for MAMA. Other group is a serious contender for SOTY.
Life’s go on is on the way guys November 20th

Hmm.. what am i gonna type... oh yeah what about this: BTS X ARMY FOREVER AND EVER yeah coz like i said before it make it looks professional no it doesnt but nevermind i dont care coz my aim is to make it as long as possible. Anyways BE is coming ARMYs are you excited? I think its gonna blow up the whole billboard and twitter and yt and the whole entire world and... just everything, you get what i mean( hopefully coz im weird and no one know what i wanna say(( i like being weird)) why are you still reading this omg you must be so bored but remember your assignment that due today?

The world sees BTS as a professional, successful, kings, at the top. But they don't see what ARMY's sees, they don't know how much hard work,  pain, problems, BTS have been through.  I might be a multi but I set my top priorities to BTS.

Hi bts
*ARMY since Bighit is not promoting "BE" yet so it's our duty to promote "BE", There are still so many A.R.M.Ys out there asking "What is BE? When is it coming?" So spread the words that BTS IS COMING BACK ON 20TH NOVEMBER WITH A FULL SELF PRODUCED ALBUM "BE", JK ALSO CONTRIBUTED IN DIRECTING THE MV SO WE BETTER GET THE MV TO 110M VIEWS & 9M/10M LIKES IN 24 HOURS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PLATFORMS LIKE SPOTIFY, ITUNES, APPLE MUSIC, DEEZER ETC WHERE WE HAVE TO STREAM AND BUY THE TRACKS TOO. WE NEED TO GET BB HOT 100 #1 AGAIN THIS CB AND MAKE THEM THE 1ST KOREAN ACT WITH A "KOREAN SONG" TO TOP THE CHART. THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD BUT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE OUR BEST AS THE MOST DEDICATED FANDOM OUT THERE. OUR 7 TRULY DESERVE IT. SPREAD THE ABOVE WORDS PLEASE. Use this as a motivation 👇👇 "THE ALBUM CONSISTS THE SOULS OF THE MEMBERS" — J-HOPE "I ALSO DIRECTED A PART OF THE MV I HOPE OUR ARMY WILL NOTICE IT, I BELIEVE IN ARMY." — Jungkook*
oke     abang
This song is just awsome. It makes my day good. This song is fully made for enjoyment i gusse. I purple you all.💜.keep it up love from Bangladesh  🇧🇩💜🇰🇷
Can we get this b-side to 100M before BE comes out on November 20th

I refer K-Pop to as Fake Pop. It’s all fake music with artists who made K-Pop so mainstream in Korea.
This is the song from Samung S20 FE ads. :)
This definitely sucks.......
Not me not even being a BTS stan but listening to this nonstop hshdhd
Me gusta más el de la chaqueta verde y los pantalones vaqueros

ARMYS REMEMBER BTS COMEBACK ALBUM "BE" WHICH IS THEIR FIRST SELF PRODUCED ALBUM COMES OUT NOV 20. BTS Always out do their records and always bring music better than previous. BTS = ARMY. So just like them we Will work harder than before and get bts more achievement then before. Stream harder than the last CB. Please check all the goals for the comeback and don't forget to keep promoting the album. Tell other armys and you friends and family. This comeback has got to be the best one yet. If any of don't know in 2016 Bon Voyage BTS were asked their wishes. And they even got a letter from their manager. The manager wrote in the letter that he hopes the members will be able to members will be able to make their self produced album one day and BTS also expressed how much they hope to make that true. Now it has become true. Back the words RM said were "We really want to Make our own Self Produced album from Beginning to Ending. This could be the possible full form of BE Beginning to Ending

Que lindos los amo
hi so i'm new to BTS and I would really like to learn their names and more about them (i am horrible with recognizing faces in general, race isnt a factor so it is genuinely hard for me to figure out who is who). Id really like to learn and get to know them better (as well as getting better with facial recognition) so anyone who can nicely help me would be much appreciated!!!!!
Adoro
ilove you Bts amooo suas músicas #bts #army Forever 🥰💃💛🎶
Namjoon was right, Jin is most likely to mess up the songs #savenamjoonagain
B - Be polite, we are the face of BTS

Hi ARMY~ I am a V-ARMY and I'm participating in the 2020-2021 Online Korean Speaking Competition, Round 1 KPOP (Korean Song). The first song that I chose is "THE TRUTH UNTOLD". So I really want to receive your support, especially from ARMYs. Ami who are wactching DYNAMITE, if you see this comment, please click the link below to see the video and push ‘like’ button to help me to enter the next round.

ARMY URGENTE     Teniendo en cuenta que BTS está a nada de dejar de ser el artista más transmitido en YouTube,es importante que se unan a un proyecto del cual se había avisado antes,consiste en hacer que BTS sea el PRIMER y ÚNICO ARTISTA con más MVS con 1B de vistas ,esto sería como regalo de fin de año de ARMY para los chicos,este proyecto consiste en que 1M de ARMYS reproduzcan:  7 veces Dynamite   1 ves Boy Whit Luv   3 veces Fake Love   3 veces Idol  3 veces Mic Drop  Al mismo tiempo intercalen con ON y Black Swan.Tambien intercalen como otro tipo de vídeos que no tenga que ver con música o Bangtan nada.  En total,tomaría 1 hora 11 minutos 36 segundos (todos los días)el proyecto comenzó el 15 de octubre y finalizará el 31 de diciembre es por eso que espero desde ahora se unan y difundan en todas las redes para que más ARMYS se enteren.  Cr.página que te recuerda por qué eres ARMY       Vamos!!! Traducelo en Inglés o al idioma que conozcas si puedes!(POR FIS!)    Posdata:si puedes en No More Dream también     No emojis!.

RIP bts 2013-2017. Sorry bts 2020 isn't as good  as these years before it.. I see no bts elements  in their mv anymore. Their motto back then was  the unyielding underdog of the whole kpop world  now they have become overrated ngl their music  really bang like they were the really underdog  that were better. Now.. they're just don't have  that motto and just attract fans that are just  toxic. Is everything crap
BE is coming Novembre 20th,save the date! Pre-save BE on Spotify and Apple Music
Less than 13M to reach 100M!!!
I love this version
This entire video is a mood
Jungkook is a mood at the beginning😂
Keep the fire burning, ARMYs! 🔥 📌Dynamite to 600M  - also aiming for most viewed MV on 2020 by a K-act AND fastest MV to hit 1B by a K-act 📌Fake Love to 800M 📌IDOL to 800M 📌Mic Drop to 800M 📌ON MV to 300M 📌ON KMF to 300M 📌Black Swan to 200M  ‼We can now calm down a bit with DNA and BWL, instead give the energy in streaming the MVs mentioned above. Specially ON and Black Swan. They deserved more. :( ‼Stream other MVs as well so they will not get left behind, but the list above is our focus.  Spread the word! 🔥🔥🔥

ARMY URGENTE   Teniendo en cuenta que BTS está a nada de dejar de ser el artista más transmitido en YouTube,es importante que se unan a un proyecto del cual se había avisado antes,consiste en hacer que BTS sea el PRIMER y ÚNICO ARTISTA con más MVS con 1B de vistas ,esto sería como regalo de fin de año de ARMY para los chicos,este proyecto consiste en que 1M de ARMYS reproduzcan: 7 veces Dynamite  1 ves Boy Whit Luv  3 veces Fake Love  3 veces Idol 3 veces Mic Drop Al mismo tiempo intercalen con ON y Black Swan.Tambien intercalen com otro tipo de vídeos que no tenga que ver con música o Bangtan nada. En total,tomaría 1 hora 11 minutos 36 segundos (todos los días)el proyecto comenzó el 15 de octubre y finalizará el 31 de diciembre es por eso que espero desde ahora se unan y difundan en todas las redes para que más ARMYS se enteren. Cr.página que te recuerda por qué eres ARMY    Vamos!!! Traducelo en Inglés o al idioma que conozcas si puedes!(POR FIS!)  Posdata:si puedes en No More Dream también   No emojis!.

진심인데 사람이 좋아서 빨아주는 건 이해가 안됨 아티스트면 노래나 춤만 보면 안됨? 말도 안되는 이유로 욕하지말라 이러는데 우리나라 아미들은 진짜 팬심이 과하게 많은 건지 개념이 없는 건지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

En total,tomaría 1 hora 11 minutos 36 segundos (todos los días)el proyecto comenzó el 15 de octubre y finalizará el 31 de diciembre es por eso que espero desde ahora se unan y difundan en todas las redes para que más ARMYS se enteren.

❤️❤️❤️🥵🦋🤤🖤🥺💟😘
ARMY since Bighit is not promoting "BE" yet so it's our duty to promote "BE", There are still so many A.R.M.Y's out there asking "What is BE? When it is coming?" So spread the words that BTS IS COMING BACK ON 20TH NOVEMBER WITH A FULL SELF PRODUCED ALBUM "BE", JK ALSO CONTRIBUTED IN DIRECTING THE MV SO WE BETTER GET THE MV TO 110M VIEWS & 9M/10M LIKES IN 24 HOURS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PLATFORMS LIKE SPOTIFY, ITUNES, BB HOT 100 ETC WHERE WE HAVE TO STREAM TOO SPREAD THE ABOVE WORDS PLEASE.  Use this as a motivation 👇👇  "THE ALBUM CONSISTS THE SOULS OF THE MEMBERS"  — J-HOPE  "I ALSO DIRECTED A PART OF THE MV I HOPE OUR ARMY WILL NOTICE IT, I BELIEVE IN ARMY."  — Jungkook
I’m A fan of Bts Because They Are Cool I Just Love Them❤️❤️

DNA & Dynamite: JungKook faz o seu rosto fofo! (DNA & Dynamite: JungKook makes your face cute!)
Hey guys, I sang a cover on this song and it would really mean a lot if y’all can check it out 🥺. I’m trying my best to grow in my singing and I want to become an artist. I also uploaded a video where I showed my vocal audition clips for pnation. I don’t want clout or nothing I just want a simple listen and constructive criticism to allow me to get better, if you read this- Thankyou ❤️.

"Lea Salonga"와 협업해 주세요...ㅠㅠ 다들 아시는 세계적인 대단한 뮤지컬스타  입니다.디즈니 알라딘 Ost의 여배우 목소리가 Lea Salonga입니다. 얼마전부터 BTS팬임을 자청하며 여러 해외방송에서 좋은 영향력을 주고 있고요,그녀는 이제 비록 나이는 들었지만 여전한 디즈니의 여왕입니다... 뮬란Ost 역시 그녀 목소리구요... 제발 BigHit에서 단 한번이라도 고려해주시길 부탁드립니다...ㅠㅠ

Hi ARMY~ I am a V-ARMY and I'm participating in the 2020-2021 Online Korean Speaking Competition, Round 1 KPOP (Korean Song). The first song that I chose is "THE TRUTH UNTOLD".

bts aku swift kerumah ku aku mau joget
Group of 7 hijus
Armies mark your attendance
This video is a blessing for Tae stans and Taekooker 1. V doing the gun shot at the end and then himself surrendering by raising hands 2. jK & V holding hands and jumping together in circle while the rest are dancing  3. In the last when everyone does one dramatic pose and then do the dynamite step but Tae forgets and is still in that pose holding head w hands while others changed the step
I loved tae solo part in this more than the official video
난 방탄소년단 잘 모르는데 진짜 노래좋다...
Strange how I've been literally listening to this song on repeat Everyday and still it feels new.. It's a masterpiece
I know you guys are coming here again and again... Shhhh don't worry you can be honest with me      Because I don't know how many times I came here :)
Ok but like this is what makes 2020 better

This version it looks like v actually knows his parts in the song...in the original when he sings at the truck he looks like he doesn't know the words..
In captions I am gonna light up like stars tonight
Happy
They r good but their fans r toxic😐
Death is inevitable, be prepared for what's to come after, repent and trust in The Lord Jesus, We have broken the law of God and deserve the punishment, the same a criminal deserves prison, but Jesus bought our pardon with His own blood, repent and trust Jesus, and all is forgiven, and you will be free from the judgement of God. I hope that all think about this with an open mind.
best cut 2:03
Very addictive!!!

Holi soy Grecia.....este mensaje va para MOA's y ARMY's....... LO QUE PASA ES QUE EN 6 DIAS (26 de octubre) LOS HERMANOS MENORES DE BTS OSEA TXT VAN A TENER SU COMEBACK Y MOA ESTA TOTALMENTE LISTO PARA ESPERARLO CON ANSIAS PERO TAMBIEN ESPERAMOS QUE ARMY TAMBIEN NOS PUEDAN APOYAR YA QUE ESE MISMO DIA TWICE HACE SU COMEBACK Y ONCE TAMBIEN ES UN GRAN FANDOM...... ENTONCES MOA ESPERA QUE ARMY APOYE A TXT Y A MOA COMO UNA FAMILIA AL IGUAL QUE LO HACE BTS. ADEMAS LOS CHICOS HAN LUCHADO MUCHO POR ESTE COMEBACK Y SE MERECEN LO MEJOR DEL MUNDO......HACI QUE ARMY Y MOA...FIGHTING!!!!!!!! SI NO VAS A APOYAR POR FAVOR AHORRATE TUS COMENTARIOS.

IMPORTANTE!   Una Army leyó un comentario en el MV de BLACK SWAN que para Diciembre osea cuando se acabe este año ya debemos tener los MV's de - BWL - MIC DROP - IDOL - FAKE LOVE (y obvio DYNAMITE) los que estén cerca de llegar al 1B, decía que antes que termine el año tenemos que terminar con esos MV's en 1B.  Eso dijo una L-army que se habían puesto de acuerdo algunas, así que nosotras/os también hagamos que otras/os también lo sepan.    Psdt: Yo he lo he copiado para que más ARMY's sepan de esto :).    Gracias por leer.  LO PODEMOS  LOGRAR APOYEMOS
Hagamos que llegue a las 100 visitas en you tube pxf army vamos que podemos
Just only watching this video make me smile while I felt so down. Thankyou :)

Bts teaching us... 2.35....jimin said not to shake hands 2.40...jk said use sanitizer
BTS
Let’s work on Dynamite to stay No. 1 on Billboard 100.  I’m sure not a lot of Army know yet about this guy of Savage Love snufu of not crediting BTS. Let’s channel instead our energy for Dynamite. BTW, never heard of this Derulo guy until BTS do a collaboration with him. I hope it’s the last.
2:05 taekook at back HAHAHAHA
Sucsesfull for bts... 💜💜💜💜

If you use the footage of B-side, but the transitions of the A-side, then you have the perfect music video.

Моя преподаватель у в универе учила меня , что у произведения искусства форма всегда соответствует содержанию . Посмотрев выступления BTS , я поняла это . Что не песня - шедевр! Гармония звуков с телом ... это просто неописуемое наслаждение от просмотра . Действительно талантливые парнишки и их хореограф !!! снимаю шляпу, низкий поклон благодарности за испытанные наслаждения ! ❤

Ojala fuera tan  fácil llegar a ti j-hope me encantas desde siempre. Tengo mi pagina en mi pais Nicaragua , pero quisiera que me conocieras por mi.
This is probably a weird comment, but Jungkook has cute bodily proportions and looks great in his clothes and when he moves/dances.

What would have set this video off, is if the video editors would have periodically turned them into cartoons of themselves. ☣️🤘🏻
*Dynamite was submitted in 3 categories for the GRAMMYs*  Maybe this year is the year, so best of luck 💜😉

��⛔‼ ️THIS ES UN REPOST‼ ️⛔�� ⚠️⚠️⚠️ARMY PAY ATENTION !!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Este tipo llamado Alllex Black (@alllexblack en instagram) ha estado usando la canción de SUGA, Daechwita, para hacer su propia canción. El abogado de BigHit le envió un correo electrónico y borró su canción, pero él está de regreso con su canción llamada &quot;10k&quot; y lanzó un teaser y se puede ver en el video a un niño asiático atado y con los ojos vendados a la silla mientras lo trata y tiene la leyenda. &quot;quién es el jefe @ bts.bighitenternainment&quot;. Su amigo también tiene un video en el que están en el auto tocando su canción &quot;10k&quot; con fotos de August D (SUGA) - Daechwita y arrancando las fotos y tirándolas al suelo mientras tiene otras nuevas con su foto y escrita &quot; 10k &quot;en ellos.

English: I'm not a ARMY, I'm BLINK, but I must admit that the music that BTS makes is perfect. They are very talented. I like the music they make. Greetings from Ecuador. Español: No soy ARMY, soy BLINK pero debo admitir que la música que hace BTS es perfecta. Son muy talentosos. Me gusta la música que hacen. Saludos desde Ecuador. Korean: 나는 ARMY가 아니라 BLINK지만 방탄 소년단이 만드는 음악이 완벽하다는 것을 인정해야한다. 그들은 매우 재능이 있습니다. 나는 그들이 만드는 음악을 좋아합니다.

��⛔‼ ️THIS ES UN REPOST‼ ️⛔�� ⚠️⚠️⚠️ARMY PAY ATENTION !!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Este tipo llamado Alllex Black (@alllexblack en instagram) ha estado usando la canción de SUGA, Daechwita, para hacer su propia canción. El abogado de BigHit le envió un correo electrónico y borró su canción, pero él está de regreso con su canción llamada &quot;10k&quot; y lanzó un teaser y se puede ver en el video a un niño asiático atado y con los ojos vendados a la silla mientras lo trata y tiene la leyenda. &quot;quién es el jefe @ bts.bighitenternainment&quot;. Su amigo también tiene un video en el que están en el auto tocando su canción &quot;10k&quot; con fotos de August D (SUGA) - Daechwita y arrancando las fotos y tirándolas al suelo mientras tiene otras nuevas con su foto y escrita &quot; 10k &quot;en ellos.:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5tjOANR3rA

I am totally loving the comment section of BTS MV sometimes because the way we sometimes ignore the haters and then they are asking for attention. There was an army who even wrote  ignore.

Mack more songs like bts
why are they doing they 1950's hair swoop motion? if the song is about 1970's "funky soul"
Lets see how many people are watching...still😎

The BTS comment section is literally the dumbest YT comment sections I have ever seen.

I saw a comment of a blink saying that boombayah has hit 1B before Boy with Luv . And some armies who were upset, don't be because if you notice bwl was released 1 year ago whereas boombayah was released 4 years ago . And you clearly know what that means !!. And i don't hate blinks or bp its just that after i saw this comment i just wanted to share my opinion. *And no hatred towards bp or blinks*

Chicos ah los amo <3
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIMIN ❤🧡💛💚💙💜

Feliz cumple mi pequeño JIMIN, muchas felicidades, se que no vas a leer esto pero quiero que sepas que de tantas voces solo la tuya me alborota el corazón, aunque la pantalla nos separe siempre estás conmigo, mis padres me hablaron de todas las drogas menos esa que es tú sonrisa, eres un ángel que cambio sus alas por un micrófono, eres mi sol por la mañana , mi estrella por la noche , eres mi luna y mi mundo entero, precioso se que no podré darte un abrazo pero mi alma y corazón están a tu lado, gracias por las mil sonrisas, felicidades OPPA te amo muchísimo JIMIN (:

IMPORTANTE!  Una Army leyó un comentario en el MV de BLACK SWAN que para Diciembre osea cuando se acabe este año ya debemos tener los MV's de - BWL - MIC DROP - IDOL - FAKE LOVE (y obvio DYNAMITE) los que estén cerca de llegar al 1B, decía que antes que termine el año tenemos que terminar con esos MV's en 1B. Eso dijo una L-army que se habían puesto de acuerdo algunas, así que nosotras/os también hagamos que otras/os también lo sepan.  Psdt: Yo he lo he copiado para que más ARMY's sepan de esto :).  Gracias por leer.

A normal person does crazy things three or four times a week, but these people crossed the line. If only in this song they did all this. Imagine the rest of the songs, God.
In love you BTS army forever❤
They are men, but their minds are the minds of your handicapped children, oh homeland

⚠️DANGER⚠️  *Our top social artist award is on danger*   Other fandoms mass voting for the award. But armys are light headed and don't even vote. Even though BTS should win it, we have to vote. Other fandoms have ONLY that award, so they are doing their best. We have so many award voting going on.   Still we should keep the record. BTS is the top social artist! Let's not give that away to another kpop group. Let's win the award!!!! ARMY!!!! Please please please vote! Be serious! Kpoopies who said this is a paper award and they don't need western validation, now trying so hard to win this.
