🎉🎉🎉🎉
he did again 2023
I think it would be better to make more news about how enthusiastic live commentary is being done in Japan. And all the comments are so happy that I can't stop crying.
The truth
I have never seen anything like him
Pitcher didn't even look back. lol
You're so amazing as always Shohei my love 😘
GOAT
30 hours of what?
best pitcher   shohei best hitter      ohtani
このホームランがこの試合のクライマックスかと思いきや、最後の最後に最高の見せ場持ってくるもんなー
0:48 mlb the show 22 cover shot 😎
ピッチャーの勇気を称賛する！！👍
この時期の大谷は全打席ホームラン出る雰囲気あったね
この試合は、ベストゲーム。 見に行きたかった。
One man beat a team
No. MLB, you missed the best part. Need to see the bot 9th inning. Ohtani stole second twice and dashed for home after Walsh's single for the win.  The best game ever. Hawaiian shirt day.
아시아 대장
His 30th home run is my favourite!!! How did he smash the baseball 😂
This is what trout was talking about!
0:31 3:22
2:02 いっぱいうんちにしか聞こえん
3:00 Shohei is also known for his skills with a bo staff, just in case anyone is still doubting that he's actually a cyborg.
Is this the same game that he stole second and then won the game after a Walsh single?
no cap, not a fan of baseball but this dude makes it fun to watch mlb. Group of friends told me to watch this dude play, not bad he's really good, very rare now to find player to have pitching skills and hitting homeruns at the same time. Might actually buy tickets w few buds to watch this guy play.
I think if he was white no one would care. White people just love Asians tho
I'm hoping Shohei Ohtani will win the MVP award as well as the Cy Young o_o ^_^
MVP
All the way from Alberta Canada I want to watch him play live.
Why are 90% of his homers with no one on base?
Good job Ohtani
I really hope he doesn't take steroids
Ohtani he is becoming a force.
Loves how he just let his game do the talking.
He's like MC of manga
I dont have a clue about baseball, i just enjoy when shohei hit the ball, statisfying
They should allow bat flips
He’s an anime drawn realistically
You’re telling me this isn’t Ookiku Furikabutte?
The poor guy that has to follow up after Shohei. How can you compete against that.
shohei ohtani the iron man of baseball
MBGA (Making Baseball Great Again!) Dang right he is!
다태오
Where are conspiracy theories that Japan engineered this kid in a lab. He is unreal 😳
Sho-time! 😎
Baseball is literally the most boring sport I have ever seen, but I love watching this guy play.
Go Go Shohei and fans 🥳🥳❤️‍🔥 PSA: For those who think it's ok to call him "Asian",  please search for "Sun Yang: You loser, I’m a Winner" and contrast him with Shohei, to get started with why its just wrong. And to understand why ”Asian" is a lazy and ignorant label to use. It's like saying Shohei is "just a sports player right?"🤨   FYI, nobody who lives in the actual Asia region thinks "Asians" are all the same thing.  I've suffered from anti-asian-hate because of being miss-identified as Chinese.   And China is trying to invade Taiwan soon, so this is a real issue here. The people of Taiwan don't want to be thought of as China either. 😬  Bottom line - Shohei is purely and uniquely Japanese! 😇 so it's wrong to refer to him as somthing else. God bless those who can understand!
泣けてきた
The courageous frost psychologically marry because vision functionally heal than a broken bugle. wiggly, reflective bait
True Law. We do not turn crackheads into Angels. We turn Angels into LOVE for our kids and all generation.
Sadaharu Oh （Japan） hit 868 home runs in his lifetime. He used to be a pitcher.
outside stirke zone? no problem.
I was at the game (I'm an Orioles fan) and even I was cheering when he hit both home runs against us!
This poor guy's back must hurt
Kami Otani!!! GOAT
i love to say i was at this game
"The Big Sho"
Overrated...rather see Andruw Jones strike out, but make a diving catch in the gap.
For the love of all that is good, please let Trout come back to this team healthy, and have Ohtani keep ripping. I'd love to see these guys in the playoffs.

Watch Koreans trying to get credit for his sportsmanship.
a class act w/ power on the bump & in the box= WOW!
I mean.... When you're throwing pound cakes to the plate, what do you expect!
So he the new face of the angels all of a sudden trout is a forgotten man
👋
You know, when Roger Maris hit 61 home runs, he had 11 by the end of May, and Ohtani had more at the end of May. He is on pace to hitting at least 60 home runs!
I hope no one accuses him of being on steroids the way he's playing now.
To be honest I feel sad to Rendon because right after Shohei at bat the camera keep locking on him and nobody focus on Rendon anymore even replay keep running instead of Rendon at bat focus. LOL
So he's basically a 6'4" 215 lbs Ichiro.
He’s exiting! Bringing back the fun in mlb

Look at the kids. The kids are fascinated to Shohei. Hopefully, they will become the base ball star of future.
it was already crazy now its just absurd!

And he does it without disgacing the sport. Mindblown
Might throw a fastball , might hit a home run 😤
強
Good for him but after all star break he will crash I give him 10 home runs after and possible DL stint
This guy may be the only good thing about this sport right now. He's amazing.
Well, he's got a shot at 60 if he doesn't slow down after the All Star Break.

待ってアメリカのYouTube急上昇に乗ってるのはすごいと思うんだが！！
化け物やないか
If only the Angels had a respectable bullpen...  The only good pitcher in that team is also the best hitter in baseball and it still wont get them anywhere.  It's frustrating.   And I'm a dodgers fan 🤦‍♂️
Wait he can pitch and hit that already makes him a legend lol
IDC about MLB much but this guy is so fun to watch! I keep checking in for his highlights
大谷はこれを他の人のためにプレイするのがどれほど難しいかを知りません
野球の神様になりつつある
With Ohtani playing final score is somewhat secondary. Like “ hey by the way did they win? “  Just amazing player joyful to watch.

バケモンw
今現在の大谷は、各打席ごとにホームランボールかわ２球以上はもらってるが、後半戦は、大谷の最も苦手なコース、球種をどのピッチャーも、大谷にだけは打たずまいと必死できた時、今シーズン初めて大谷は挫折を経験するだろう。 野球ファンとは、このピッチャー対大谷の駆け引きを楽しみに野球場へ向かうものだったが、この精神的緊張感を味わえなくしたのが日本の無知な感情移入に酔いしれるために観戦にくる女だ。 いきなり横でキャーキャー喚いてもらっては野球ファンの醍醐味は味わえなくなってしまったんだ。  誠に自己中心的で後から来た新参者のくせに勘違いして選手に割り込む恥知らずが日本の一般的な女の有様だ。  はっきり言うが、こんなバカな女に選挙権なんか与えるくらいなら、男に2票あげた方が有効活用出来る。  大衆YouTubeのコメント欄で、人生うまくいってないとか無明がほざいてますが、年収2千万以上あるやつは、こんなところにコメントなんかするはずがない。  それにしても、ここにコメントする日本人は芸が小さいぜ。  結論を申すと、後半戦の大谷のホームランペースは前半の半分以下に落ちることは間違いない。
Babe Ruth is Shohei Ohtani of the United States?????  Some American said！

The reason we all like him is not only he plays the baseball well but because he is humble and has respect for the other players and the umpires.   Stay who you are, Shohei! His parents did a wonderful job.
最強。
アメリカってちょっとヒット打ってもそんなに湧かないとこが好きw 野球はアメリカしか好きじゃないかな〜 でも高校野球は好きかも
My 86 year-old grandma who never watches any sports KNOWS who this monster is and understands how he makes this game SO exciting for EVERYONE! Gotta admire how magnetic a power this man has on a lot of non-baseball fans! Never seen anything like it...

Hello Everyone and welcome to your daily dose of Ohtani.

OHTANISAN!!!! What a nice home run !!!

so much fun to watch!
He has the distinct advantage of being able to ask himself, "what would I throw to me in this situation?"
GIVE HIM THE MVP RIGHT NOW!!! Shohei is beyond unbelievable ... never seen anything like it

My dad loved baseball. He came from a family of 14, 11 of them boys, that actually had their own baseball team. I really wish he was still alive to see this man play ball. Shohei Ohtani makes this game look easy. I doubt we will ever see his like again, in our lifetime. history is being made every time he steps onto the diamond.

Reminds me of my high school days.
I imagine everything is in slomotion for him.

もし日ハム帰ってきたらパ・リーグの環境変わりそう
Of Ohtani's last 20 hits, 15 have been homers, the rest have been 2 doubles, 1 triples, and 2 drag bunts.
What an amazing talent. He's rekindling my interest in baseball. Very easy guy to root for.

Stephen Curry (made me back to NBA).   and now, one more name has been added on my list.  6. Shohei Ohtani (MLB- made me back to watch MLB)   GO Ohtani!!       he most
we are proud of him

everytime Ohtani leads his team to victory i want to eat sushi, tempura and sashimi amd listen to The Vapors😀
This guy was playing with a Japan team 8 years ago and was throwing a 100 mph fastball then and he still throwing a 100 today
The best thing about this kid is his attitude.  It's so easy to root for the guy because of his humility.  He just looks like hes having fun and I'm grateful I get to witness his greatness.
Gets 1m views in a matter of hours. McGregor-like hype. If he throws a no-hitter he breaks the internet.
Shohei is the custom character you make in the game with maxed out stats
Yankees will offer this dude 10 years/ $1 billion.
This reminds me of the steroid era. Brings back good mementoes. Home run updates literally every single day from McGwire and Sosa.
최고의 괴물이다 ㄷㄷ
When Trout comes back everybody will be in trouble
Never seen anything like this in baseball
This guy is amazing.
Japanese　pride.
Please return Ohtani to Nippon-Ham Fighters.  The Nippon-Ham Fighters are at the bottom of the league and it's hard.
Man... If he hit 30+ homeruns for the entire season while still being an effective starting pitcher I would said that was really impressive.... he did it before the all-star break.... 🤯
Nick Fury may get in contact with Ohtani in the near future🤭
This kid MIGHT just have a future in the big leagues.
Ohtani with the tasteful bat flip. I love it
mvp is approaching him
This is literally child's play to him. He's barely breaking a sweat and he's on pace for a 60+ HR, 130+ RBI, 25+ SB season while also pitching at a high level. He's absolutely unreal
Imagine if the Angels could actually get on base in front of him.   He would have so many RBI's on any other team.
"He's a baaaad man!" - Stephen A. Smith
Words can’t describe how good he is
It is all about those 2 kids! I know that feeling, for me it was back in the 80's and that is how I saw #44 #MrOctober
Thanks for a great Highlight replay as always!
零刀流の自分からすると褒めざるを得ないですねこれは。

P E D PED PED PED PED PED PEEEEEE EEEEER DEEEEEEEEEZ
Definitely impressive but not best hitter to ever come out of Japan to MLB. Two better are Godzilla Matsui & Suzuki. Not best hitter/pitcher as Babe Ruth is the legend of legends and if a player today would probably hit 100 HRs a year with a 380 BA and a whip of no higher than 1
IMO, if he hits 62, he holds the record, period.
SHOMEI THE MONEY might have 40 by all star weekend. He is gonna make vlad's triple crown into a double tiara.  Vlad was first to 20 HR but Shomei the money is first to 30 HR and 3 ahead of vlad with less plate appearances than vlad. AND THE CRAZIEST SCHIET ABOUT THIS IS THE TURN AROUND WAS LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!!!!!!  Sho only had 1 at bat against yankees when he pitch a few days ago. VLAD was favorite to win triple crown and mvp 2 weeks ago. Now vegas  has Shomei as favorite to win MVP.
OTANI EGUITE

The Angels are so similar to the Braves this year (aside from the face Angels have HOU in their division, but teams are still similar), they have all the offensive tools they need, and have actually both scored more than enough runs to be at least 1st or 2nd in their divisions.  Pitching has let both teams down. They are very similar in their abilities to hit homeruns and score runs (Braves have 2 more HRs as a team but Angels have 21 more runs as a team). The one stark difference in pitching woes, however, is that the Angels troubles appear based on the stat lines to come from Starting Pitchers where as the Braves issue is absolutely their bullpen. Both teams, coincidentally, are 40-41 but the Braves have a Run Differential of +16 and the Angels sit at -32 Run Differential(possibly explained by the difference in Division Leaders...HOU scores a ton of runs. Don't know much of their pitching but it might be fair to say they rely on offense. Conversely, the Mets who lead the NL East have a garbage can for an offense, yet their pitching is PHENOMENAL). DeGrom'ed K'ed 14 Braves the other night in 7.0 IP (thought I will say, the umpire was giving him one specific spot that was about a ball off the plate for a strike all evening...props to DeGrom for being able to drill that spot over and over I guess though).  Anyways, born a Braves fan and always will be but I'm also a BASEBALL fan and love me some Shohei. I was curious where they stood and was shocked how similar they are to ATL, both in terms of virtually identical strengths and weaknesses as a team, as well as the identical records at the halfway point. Every team would love to have a Shohei on their team but to be honest I enjoy having and watching Acuna Jr just as much. That's our boy!.... Along with Ozzie, Freddie, Dansby, and even Austin Riley beginning to emerge as the reliable contributor we've been expecting :).
I hope he beats Bonds record... Very possible with this guy
How do you say Superman in Japanese? He is incredible. 🙂⚾️⚾️⚾️

I have never watched a full baseball game until shohei ohtani was on my recommended. Why are people not talking about him more? He's big and making people who don't watch baseball like me want to watch baseball.
大谷さんパワー貰える！🔥
He is pitcher. lol
生中継で見てたけど、この試合一発目のHRでまじで鳥肌たった。。。しかもチームで一番足速くて盗塁も決めちゃう大谷さん半端ないんよ
He’s really good but he won’t surpass Bonds, not sure if anyone ever will.
Otani is too big star and lol I want you to do your best without overdoing it! Otani is the best 😭
By the way, Otani holds the fastest record for Japanese pitchers.
He’s good

Japan is now discouraged and exhausted by the Olympics, which are being pushed forward despite the corona disaster. I am very happy to see Otani's performance and it makes me feel better. It gives me the energy to work hard again tomorrow.  Go, Otani!  From a Japanese

Vlad vs Ohtani. Just like the Sosa vs McGwire days.

MVP
I'm Japanese. How's his reputation in America?
日本の、いや世界の宝、いやもはや宝という言葉では言い表せない！！！！！！！ねぇ！！！！！！！
日本の宝
Clear evidence of Asian hate. All those people screaming at the poor man's achievements.
Do the Angels have the best 2 players in baseball? What do you guys think?
Amazing. Have they ever let him take a walk? At this point are u really going to risk it lol
Is this PS5?😳
ニュースを見るときの唯一の楽しみが大谷選手の活躍を見るときだわ。
He is truly the pride of Japan!
是非オリンピックに出てほしかった
大谷しか勝たん
マウンドYakult書いてあって草
Is 74 out of the question? Just throwing it out there. He's been hitting home runs every game and seems like a different hitter since the start of June.
I am not really a big fan of baseball, but this guy is fun to watch
日本、東北の誇り🇯🇵
The best player in the league
3:01 How do you do it?  It's cool . The bat is spinning.  By left hand.
凄すぎ笑、鳥肌立ったわ 特に二発目笑
Must see TV is right !!  AMAZING 👏👏👏👏👍
OHTANI No.1‼︎‼︎
Otani is proud of Japan!
That’s crazy power ! Wow can’t wait to watch him when he’s in town
Alright I’m watching angels games every night from now on. This is unreal
オオタニさん！！凄いです😭✨
La verdad ohtani es un fenomeno
2021シーズン自体がショウタイムになることを願っています！
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👑
He's going to say,  " I'm the only one who can retire me. "
♪───Ｏ（≧∇≦）Ｏ────♪
天上天下唯我独尊
The Japanese home run king in MLB is Hideki Matsui and the number is 31. Ohtani will be the GOAJ. No, Ohtani is supposed to be the GOAT!!
I’ll just this again: The Angels do not deserve this once in a lifetime player.
We shouldn't take event like this for granted.  SO truly unique baseball player.
It seems pretty much impossible that Ottani doesn't get the MVP
感動をありがとう
Pitchers will probably just walk him for now on...
Hi Babe Ruth
マジで二刀流なのが凄いww
どんなYouTuberよりも急上昇一位をとってるから、実質彼はYouTuber

MVP
Ohtani is Japanese pride!!
dudes playing the show on rookie mode
I watched him playing at the national high school tournament.His hamstrings are like horse's ones. And of course he h it a big homerun from japanese famous pitcher.
He's not human
Alterni-ty !
But the guy can't even switch hit....or can he?
love the later home run where the announcer says it was a good pitch running away. It was 96 miles an hour running right into the middle of the plate.
This guy is a starting pitcher!!! What we are witnessing is amazing.
自分のケツは拭く。しっかりできる人なかなか少ない
He is a starting pitcher who will hit 60hrs, earn 120RBIS, get 25stolen bases and 200Ks. Most talented player in ML history.
There's a new Babe Ruth in the house.
I was there, how do you request a curtain call?
#StopAsianHate #Dembele #Griezmann #France
Lagares looks a bit jealous every time he salutes otahni he’s like Man U gonna keep at it ? God damn here I am can’t even get a hit and u getting multiple HR games like if we was playing the show
神の子
GOD＝OTANISAN
imagine how many RBIs he'd have if there were guys on base for these homers
大谷さん🇯🇵🇯🇵
If reincarnation are real this man is Babe Ruth all over again man this season has been exciting

They change pitcher everytime Ohtani stands on the batter's box
Walsh Nice batting‼️😍
The Japanese babe ruth
The pride of Japan🇯🇵 頑張れー！！
日本のヒーローや！
Every morning when I wake up it’s another Ohtani highlight
I wonder if Shohei's focus on hitting is hurting his pitching. He's human after all.
そりゃあファン投票獲得できますわな
すごいね 大谷さん
大谷ってすごいな
最高でした。
Ohtani is our hounor. Japan star!!!
Big in USA
His salary is peanut comparing what others are making. He can pitch and hit.
メジャーに大谷通用するかじゃなくて もうメジャーが大谷に通用してない
いつでも大谷翔平で。 大丈夫でしょうが、たまに天狗になって残念な感じにならないで下さい。 人生において、最初で最後に見るヤバい日本人
感動してしまう、、素晴らしすぎます。 どうか怪我なく野球できますように⭐️パワーを笑顔をありがとう！！
シーズンMVPってサッカーでいうバロンドールみたいなこと？
Dramatic game！w(*ﾟoﾟ*)w・・・・🙌🙌🙌
Is Trout or Salmon coming back?
He's a pitcher who throws 102.5mph & HR king
Now the angels need better pitcher tank trout comes back
BIG!village!!saaann!!!!!
3:01 pretty sick samurai bat spin as Sho-time steps out
Baseball just got better and fun to watch with vald tatis sho17
NICE大谷! FIGHT大谷!！
野球に興味ないけど日本人がここまで活躍するのはめちゃ嬉しいね！
大谷翔平はほんとに凄い。 日本の誇り。
pitcher？
日本人いませんか？
スーパースターはやはり撮られる側🎥‼︎

Doesn’t sound normal coming off his bat either he’s a machine or somethings up with those Bats????
大谷は日本の誇りだ！！！！
mvp! mvp! mvp!
Btw the kanji for Ohtani Shohei （大谷翔平）literally means "Big Valley Fly Flat" -  and I miss the "Big Fly Ohtani-san!"
BIG FLY G.O.A.T.ANISAN!!!
He is so exciting to watch . Incredible
ヤバかε=ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┌(;￣◇￣)┘
They are going to give this guy his own holiday in Japan
I was at this game and my throat hurts for screaming. big fly٫ ohtani san!
He's the hottest property in American Sports right now. 🔥🔥
thank you,Bank of Baltimore.
世界中のゲイが彼を狙っています🇯🇵🇺🇸
日本万歳🙌大谷くん万歳🇯🇵🎌
本当に大谷は日本人に勇気を 持たしてくれる人物だと思う、 自分的に国民栄誉賞を 受賞してもいいと思う
Truly a shame he plays for such an awful team. Same with Trout.
日本人いますか〜？🙋‍♂️
おじさま達ももう認めるだろうね 大谷は松井を超えたと
大谷翔平ってずるくね？
化け物すぎる、ここ最近の5安打全部ホームランとかヤバすぎだろww
王貞治がメジャー行ったみたいや
To bad he’s on the angels. Idk why he insisted to play in the west coast, he could be playing for rings right now at this age.

I'm dreaming wowwwwwww. Ohtani-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnn!!!!!!!!!!
love ohtani
👍imagine he played everyday at least at firstbase.....AWESOME WOULD BE THE ....👍CHEERS👍
Whao!, one for all and all for one! Couldn’t be better than this.
彼を怪物と呼びます Call him a monster
Finally a classy player showing respect for the game and doesn’t hot dog it and hustles all the time! To many conceited, arrogant, spoiled brats and lazy major leaguers!
I'm Japanese. I have study English for 2 years. 2 years ago, I can't understand English. but recently, I am starting to understand English little by little. of course shohei's homerun makes me happy, but I'm also happy to understand English written in this comment section. sorry for the poor English.
大谷翔平

It's too dangerous. Words don't come out anymore.

3:01 배트돌리는거 좆간지
My 86 year-old grandma who never watches any sports KNOWS who this monster is and understands how he makes this game SO exciting for EVERYONE! Gotta admire how magnetic a power this man has on a lot of non-baseball fans! Never seen anything like it...
大谷翔平！！MVP！！神！！
the most underpaid MLB athlete
令和の化け物
MVPコール精神的に負担にならないかな、、って不安に思ってたら30本目のホームラン打ってて杞憂だったかってなった😂
He's so incredible.
This guy is a beast!  Exciting to watch no matter what team you root for.  Sure there are other players in the league that are great or even dare I say better than him at maybe one or two things, but good luck on finding one that has Ohtani's depth and full arsenal of weapons to make him so dangerous.
this is dream
GOD
Is it still limited capacity at Angels stadium? If not the fan base is a disgrace. A packed house will lift the Angels to wins they otherwise wouldn’t get
茂野吾郎超えてるだろ
LA should be ashamed for not appreciating what they have...bring him to NY we will show him what appreciation really is. California is lost to communism right it off. People are just so depressed..no curtain call?
Ok now I'm starting to believe the hype because this man is getting ridiculous.
大谷ーーーーーー！！！！！
Out of othani league
なんだかんだ言ったって、彼のプリップリのツーケーが、ズボンにピッタリ表れているところが実にローエーなんですなぁ…
Unusual othani draws a base 2 time in a turn
And everyone forgot to mention.. off to a great July already 😂
Shohei Ohtani is not only carrying his team on his shoulder but he’s literally carrying MLB on his shoulder as well. This is no exaggeration and I’m not being overly dramatic here. Don’t believe me? Just take a look at the view counts on this video that’s been uploaded for 9 hours and has got almost 1 million views as opposed to other star players and games that are posted. Almost all of Shohei’s videos have high view counts as if the MLB is the Shohei Ohtani show.
Ohhhhtaniiiiiiiiii the best
日本の急上昇1位なのに、外国語しか見当たらないの誇らしくなるw
Mightmares of othani pitchers
He’s getting at least 50 hr

It's really fun to watch Ohtani baseball🥳💪💪💪
バケモンまじで
大谷半端ないって！
I'm sorry but it's still way to early in the season to decide who's better between him and Vlad. They're both having monstrous seasons but it's not even the all star break yet
日本の野球人の誇り
後ろ姿が日本人に見えんw
How can you not like this guy.
WHEN IS THE ALL- STAR GAME PLS TELL ME
ｷﾀ━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━!!
オオタニさん…
Do Westerners think Otani is handsome? Is it attractive to women? You're such a cartoon character. You're not missing anything.
ちょ、やりすぎ！宇宙人ってバレちゃうよ！
This puppet getting fast ball down the middle of the plate every time stop it nothing else
笑死，在台灣發燒9
松井秀喜と黒田を1人でしてるようなもんだもんな
He is a legend. Cheer up Shohei from Japan!!!
大谷、活躍してて嬉しい！
Hey guys! We have a SHOHEI for you!!
Coooooool Shohei!!!!
Every team needs more supporting players like Iglesias.  This ballplayer is phenomenal.  He adds tremendously to every Ohtani homerun.  I just thoroughly enjoy Iglesias and his enthusiasm when others succeed.
これは人ですか？
4:18 MVP! MVP! MVP!
Why are they even pitching to him at this point?
同じ日本人として心の底から誇らしい…
Babe Ruth: (´⊙ω⊙`)！
This guy is bringing fans back to baseball. I don’t even like the Angels and I check their box scores every morning to see how he did.
For a pitcher the most savage bat Flip your gonna see
大谷翔平は日本の誇りです
He is a star of Japanese!I am proud of him as the same Japanese.
At this rate he is going to beat the seasonal records with homruns
he is god
His swing, that extension and just his galloping stride around the bases says it all.  He is special.  Hope we can see his pitching explode too
Hey MLB this video has horrible audio!
This kid is incredible
本当に日本の誇りだ
結構下の方までスクロールしても日本語のコメント無いの草
Ohtani is daemon.

He is a pride of Asian.
Poor Rendon for low RBI due to Shohei.
シングルヒットよりホームランを打つ男  足を上げないバッティングフォームでよくあんなに飛ぶよな。

His habit is  home run.   This is his manner.  He is super star.
If only Mike Trout wasn't hurt all the time...

Amazing..wow. How good can he pitch?
大谷えぐい！
Godzilla
日本人の規格を超えてる、まさしく世界レベル
This man can't stop
Chinese and Koreans are jealous and claim that Otani is not Japanese, but he is a pure Japanese.  I'm tired of their claims.
何？？、何？？ 夢見てるの？？ お父さんと同じ歳です貴方の！ 何なの？？ 死ぬわ〜 しょうへい！ なんなんですか？何が怒ってるの？？？？？
ほんまにカッコよすぎるんやけど。 オオタニサン。さすがっす。

Shohei : home run is easy Ichiro : hit is easy I : missing is easy🤣

Grew up watching Will Clark with giants decades ago... hope Ohtani hits 57 hr, 125 rbi, 20 sb, mvp

I was not interested in watching baseball,but nowadays I usually watch! Ohtani (大谷) is fantastic !! from 🇯🇵 (I can’t express in English well,I’m sorry🙇‍♂️)
ほんとに波乗ってるなー、日本人としてほんとに嬉しい。小学生の時から好きだったから
How is MLB marketing him at the moment? They going all in or sporadically? I'd say milk him right now! He's a kpop star of baseball lmao
3:00 so cool
I think Shohei was told by the team to go easy on the first couple seasons of his career but now they say: REALEASE THE OHTANI
Home run big brother!!
대단하다 오타니~~~^^
Big fly Otani san!!!
すごすぎるって！！！！！
Hes single handedly making a case against having a DH all together
really!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?😂😂😂
マジで最高でした！大谷さんの活躍は毎日の楽しみです！！
人間なのか？？？？？？？
They need to start putting him up on TV everytime he comes up to bat… it’s amazing what he is doing…
Ohtani is crashing  MLB
sad face at 3:54
He is proud of Japan🇯🇵!  Every time I see him praised by everyone in the world, I am very happy as a Japanese person.  Thank you so much!!
日本男児！！！大日本帝国万歳！！！ 竹島isJAPAN！！！！！
Only thing he can't do is switch hit, but probably can do that to
Their team need a win now.
Thanks from Japan 🇯🇵🥰
真是怪物
You know this specimen with 30 bombs has A 1.31 WHIP and he plays about 32.4 games less in a full season then any other position player because he is pitching unless he is pitching in the NL. If my math is wrong don’t judge but correct me it’s the middle of summer for my high school
Come on showtimes
What wanderful  world
Mike Trout needs to give half his salary to Ohtani. He deserves it more
The kid who is loved by Babe Ruth
かっこよすぎだろ
まじで誇らしい
Ho-hum, another two homers by the man who makes home runs into an art form.  Ah, he just felt he needed to make up for that last game he pitched so disastrously.  So he did make up for that, in a big way.
英語ばっかでヤキモチ妬いちゃう❤️
shohei〜🇯🇵
はあ素敵

MLB公式がまさかの一位
M! V! P! M! V! P!

Don’t take this for granted. We are witnessing the GOAT right now.

Shohei is overrated man. All he’s capable of is home runs, can’t even do single base hits.

First time ive gotten goose-bumps watching MLB in 20yrs+

Just woke up to this in the east coast. What a time to be alive as.a baseball fan.
I’m in a dilemma here: I’m rooting for the Orioles(I spent my early childhood living in Baltimore, MD), but I’m also rooting for Ohtani(I’m Japanese like him).

I started to look at MLB to see Otani's success, and I learned that MLB is a very exciting and gentleman's entertainment. The atmosphere that the players give off is very cool. I also love the atmosphere of the audience Good luck to all major leaguers and MLB fans from Japan

my routine is watching his homerun
Wow, this guy hits so many homers I have to double check if I'm watching the latest hr highlight
This dude is nasty
THE LEGEND
oh my ohtani
goro shigeno ? its u?? in real life?
日本人いたりする……？
大谷さん相変わらずヤベー笑
I feel so happy today, too! No Ohtani no baseball ‼️  Ohhhhh Tani San‼️  今日も感動をありがとうーーーー😆‼️
Ohtani is a pure Japanese. He is proud of Japan.
He throws, he hits, and he even steals. I just cannot believe what I'm witnessing. He's like Shaq with madass 3 pointers and pinpoint passes. Idk maybe even crazier than that...
I have a feeling hes going to start accumulating a lot of walks
It is my daily routine to watch Otani's activities on youtube. I am impressed and motivated, and I think I will do my best today! Thank you 😊
Yes!　Mr.Baseball!!!
この人は人間なのか？
Nice🙌💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🎉🗼
He would be michael jordan of baseball
Ya le hicieron su prueba de antidopin?
かっこいい… (Sho cool…)
MLB now has to post 2 separate videos of Shohei’s match highlights
MLB player of the Monthsss
Shohei Ohtani is the pride of Japan！！
MVP
amazing  ohtani
Mvp
Amazing
Seeking Hideki Matsui's 31 HRs
In flamenco, the best singers with the best compas (rhythim) are the ones that can clap the rhytim for themselves, no need of clappers. But even greater, is the ones who can also play guitar. Being a pitcher himself plus his talent, he makes it look like its a scramble.
He Makes Baseball Great Again‼︎ Now everyone exciting his play!
笑死.草
i cant think of any bigger japanese dudes...yokozuna was short right?  plus i dont think he was really japanese
japanese pride!🎌 ohtani go!!!!!⚾️
OOOO BABY YEZZIR!
Who could imagine a player better that Mike Trout...Holy cow!!!
I’ guess I’ll be the first to say it...I’m a believer that Ohtani may hit the most homeruns ever in a season. Why not??
almost fans have forgotten about the low repulsion ball used in MLB this year....
Be bold, be modest.
Comentator said he has never seen anything like that, like Mike Trout haven’t dome that for 10 years
So glad he doesn't point to "heaven"  after he does it.
ウォルシュ愛してるぜ！
4:16 ward is probably watching a clip of the homer and he's like "wow..." And then stares at Shohei like "how tf did he do that" 🤣🤣
대다나다 진짜
dude makes me wanna watch baseball.. and i think it’s boring to watch! exciting
TROUT IS LIKE DAMN I USE TO BE THE CROWD FAVORITE
Legend⚾️
you get goosebumps watching this guy
UNSTOPPABLE.
3:54 😮
Man their are some real fun players to watch lately. Othani Guerrero Jr Tatis Jr Bichette Jr Mike Trout and when he’s healthy Luis Robert for the White Sox. Awesome few year to be a baseball fan. Let keep the magic rolling!!!
The fact that he can run too… crazy
He should hit 76 and break Bonds' fake record
We are witnessing something in baseball that is mind-blowing.  He is in a category all to himself.  Go Ohtani!!!
Come back to the Fighters!  From Sapporo citizens. L(‘▽‘)／
What's sad about Ohtani is this, hear me out. When have you seen 2 great players playing for the wrong team? Yes, Trout and Ohtani are wasting their careers with the Halos, Trout hasn't even made the playoffs since making his debut. As skilled as Shohei is, i don't see them in the playoffs this year. Yes, we are witnessing greatness out of Ohtani, but, what has Trout done lately? Two awesome talents in the wrong team. Sad 😢
Otani shohei is birthday the day after tomorrow👏🎉
There will be a lot of babies named Shohei in Japan next year, no doubt.
I was saying it since 2019, this kid is gonna be a beast. I wish I can run to the guy that called me crazy back then, that Ohtani wasn't gonna hit MLB pitchers, well, he's killing them. I see him hitting 60 this season if he keeps it up.
Ohtani and Ruth. That's it.
3:00 He is Harry Potter
He really gives me chills. What a maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!!  Proud of you,Shohei! Thank you from Japan.
Shohei,Otanih,is COVID19,infection・・・ Severe・・・

從大谷翔平日本職開始看他比賽，這小子真的很神。 Watching his game from Shohei Otani in Japan, this kid is really amazing.
Wish he would have signed with the Mariners
Iglesiasの歓迎に毎回癒されます
The story goes as he thinks. Is it 27 consecutive strikeouts next? 😊 I pray from Japan not to get injured
never seen balls hammered like that with aluminum bats
Suuuggoiiii !
this guy is like my 99 maxed out character
Better than Trout
.He's the pride of Korea. The best Korean player.
Even Babe Ruth couldn't hit 30hrs while he was a pitcher. Simply amazing
4:08 ♡
種付けしたいよ〜😭
オオタニサン、ヤバいです(Ohtani is monster.)⚾
本当にすごい。^^
Inside, outside, it doesn't matter bro. His form is exceptional. I don't know why, but it's gotta be his batting stance and his swinging form. What a great power. But welp, he's not human after all. 😅
最高最強dangerous

A super freak is an understatement for this dude, Rick James says.
It’ll be interesting to see if Shohei accumulates more WAR this season compared to peak Ichiro (that one year where he broke George Sisler’s all-time single-season hits record). He most likely will considering his added pitching contributions. Also another intriguing thought: Who’s more valuable to the Angels when healthy, Shohei or Trout?
Legend.
5:11 もうアメリカの子供たちが発狂しちゃってるじゃん
Just imagine if Trout sits after this sparked Otani
We are all witnesses.
Pride of Chinese!!!! He is Chinese Superman.
date of birth July／5／ 1994 Happy birth  day !!! Shohei Ohtani！
おはよう
ヒイローインタビュー　カリーさんにお願いしたい。
Honestly I have a feeling he will be the next Babe Ruth and he might hit 60 homeruns this year without steroids or cheating.  This was a super natural gift from GOD to him. I don't think we will see another player like Ohtani a  great pitcher and a phenomenal hitter. This guy can do anything.
I hear ichiro is giving him tips.
can he hit 60 homeruns this season?
NBA fan here but I can clearly see that the way baseballs come off his bat is special. And if someone recognizes these differences in unfamiliar fields, it’s always a really really special talent. It’s just as special as Curry’s 3s. (Sorry nba fans but trust me it really is) For those who still says im exaggerating, ohtanis got more top-tier skills to show… God bless.
와우
What Ohtani does in a game is called "Full spectrum dominance" in military parlance.
I was at this game with my son. I told him that he was going to hit another home run and boom…my son had a blast
大谷！！
Now he even sho-off his sword skill 3:00
日本人にシーズンを通して精神的に肉体をコントロール出来る筈はないです。  おそらく、後半にも肘の故障からバッターで行かざるを得なくなり、バランスわわ崩して、終われば四十本止まりで終わります。  周りが騒ぎすぎです。 所詮日本人ですから、日本のマイナーリークがお似合いです。
最後のほうのシーンで、大谷さんのHRに大はしゃぎの男の子に対して、全く興味なさそうな女の子の対比が面白い…(^_^)
proof the DH is bullshit
같은 아시아인으로써 대단하다고밖에 말 못하겠네요 쇼헤이 응원합니다 ㅎㅎ
I thought Ohtani was overrated but I changed my mind.
Yes, Iglesias is there again, and again!!!!
L.A. fans don't deserve this guy. Stadium is empty.
정말 대단한놈인거 인정
in Japanese, Shohei＝翔平. 「翔」 means 「flying」、「平 」means 「constant」, as its name suggests!
woopty doo barry bonds had 60 at the all star but he’s banned for being black…
Blessings from Taiwan  🇹🇼😇💖   Go Angels  🥰 Go Ohtani 💪🤩👍 Go Walsh 🥳   Ohtani is the FASTEST player that reaches 30 Homeruns and 10 stolen bases !  💪🤩👍   Happy for his 30th homerun ! 🥳🥳🥳
He needs to drop out of the home run derby so he can make a run at 60 homers
The Angels better give him a very nice contract in the future. And they better keep him
he's cute
Shohei Ohtani videos are getting a lot more views than anything else on the MLB channel.
I don’t understand why there are more home runs than single hits．  by Japanese Angels fan．
メジャーリーグNO1. 大谷翔平！
Shohei is that overpowered anime character in real life
Shohei, welcome to the Avengers.
What a f'ing beast.
Incredible!
He take care of my weekly
I love Vladdy and he\s a close runner up, but there's no way Ohtani isn't winning AL MVP
애는 진짜 천재네 ㄷㄷ
Ohtani must be thinking he is in a shounen where he is the main character, because that man makes it look easy.
凄い
MVP😀👍
3:00 my fav part
유일하게 응원하고 좋아하는 일본인. 격하게 응원한다 오타니
I’m not the biggest baseball fan. But I’ve noticed, through highlights, a lot of the time no one is on base when he is up to bat. Is he not in the lineup count to where batters in front of him have a high chance of getting on base?
Ohtani is the best thing going on in baseball
Amazing player , mvp
This is insane...
Shohei is just on another level. MVP no doubt about it.
Not bad for a pitcher
Ohtani never stop!
showtani !!!!!!!
Somebody please tell him that Homerun Derby hasn’t started yet.  He’s somehow misunderstood. Maybe lost in translation.
Lmao....  This is getting ridiculous...
imagine trout on the same team
Amazing!
Check him for roids!!!
I love seeing iggy hype up shohei, always the first one to show love after he Homer's. Great sportsmanship between team mates 👏
He is really fun to watch
China is the future!!!!

3:00 I see that bat twirl
How much will the Yankees would pay for him?
the like god man, it too crazy
3.60 ERA, 30 Home Runs and 12 Stolen Bases. There’s literally nothing he can’t do.
This dude is absolutely insane man. A true once in a generation talent.
I love this anime
3:02 SO COOL
Thank you for adding another morning rootine :Ohtani Homer news from Jpn
SUPERSTAR. Love youに笑ってもうたし、 30号ホームランの後、Iggyがキスしたかと思ってびっくりしちゃった笑
どうなってんねんｗｗ
I’m a Yankee fan but I love Shohei Othani he will be the homerun king
sooo... can we just give him cy young, mvp, triple crown, silver slugger P, silver slugger DH, gold glove P already?
Lets back to Angels Stadium guys
There have been a lot of comparisons between Ohtani and Babe Ruth.  Do you think he ought to take a shot at calling a home run like the Babe allegedly did?  If the pitcher sees it, does Ohtani get beaned?
He is Japanese pride!
大谷翔平！！
When Mike Trout comes back the Angels will have the two best players in the game!
3:28 子どもたちの喜びようも素敵
勝負してくれたピッチャーにも敬意を表したい！ 全ての人達に感動を与える選手！大谷。 日本人として誇りに思います。
OMG! MVP! MVP! MVP!🦄
Those are video game home runs. Angels all day!!
Nice 👍👍
大谷真的太強
I'm so glad he's having a magical first half. Hopefully in October we'll see him trying to beat the homerun record held by Barry 🇺🇸 Bonds.
Hey Siri, let me know how to be him in my next life. What should I do in this life? How many people should I help?
How cool is this guy! He makes this sports soooo much fun to watch. Can't leave eyes on him!
この先、大谷がホームラン打たない日があっても過剰に落胆しないで欲しい 彼がやってる事は当たり前じゃ無いのだから・・・
To Shohei, Break the record of Bonds!
wow!!!
I was just starting to think maybe he calmed down a bit.
Ohtani hit 2 HRs on his 20th birthday and I was at the stadium in Chiba, Japan. Then I wasn’t happy because he defeated my favorite team. Fans singing happy birthday was so annoying. Anyway, I predict he hits 3 home runs on July 5, his 27th birthday. Then I will be happy, for sure.
So happy for him and his success in the MLB. He cuts a massive presence at the plate. He’s like Paul Bunyan 😯
MVP
MVP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is he one of the greatest hitting pitchers of all time? The guy is a stud.
Im korean. I love him.
Baseball is easy.
こんなのがピッチャーとか脳がバクるわ
kv
The sound the ball makes off of his bat is insane. Every homer sounds like a freaking canon shot.
He hits HR like a normal hit.
Ok, when I get MLB The Show 21 on the Xbox, the 1st player to get traded to the Mariners is Shohei Ohtani.
MLB channel actually thought they are done with Shohei's highlight for today...
He is supersaiyazin
Must see TV
It's crazy how unbelievable this guy is.  I stop watching baseball for a bit, but Ohtani pulled me back lol  MVP  MLB got great young players saviors Ohtani, Wladimir, Acuña, Tavis etc
2021년 MVP는 '오타니'로 !!
天才だわ
Another great talent who's best years will be wasted on an organization that doesn't understand that pitching wins championships.
最後にお子さんが興奮してるのいいね♪１本のみならず逆転の２本目を目の前で観戦出来てるんだから自分も幼かったらあの様になってたと思うしヒーロー、ファンに なるよねｗしかも盗塁までしてサヨナラのホームインｗ恩を恩で返せる男！

Thank you!! Thank you(^O^)／
先日挫折を味わって でもチームメイトが救ってくれて 翌日大活躍 漫画か！！ 打者大谷は完璧だな！😆
This guy is nuts
This is literally incredible, I've never seen like this
I have a man-crush on Shohei Ohtani.
He’s just insane I love watching him idk why
Living legend
I can't wrap my HEAD around what Ohtani is doing. I don't think most people realize this historic run he is doing. I am honored to witness it
このホームランより衝撃のラストだった 四球→盗塁からの最高の走塁でサヨナラ勝利 倒れ込んでのガッツポーズは本当に漫画の主人公だった
Brian!?
ultimate japanese 『SHOHEY OHTANI』
大谷選手。改めて、私は大谷選手を、同じ日本人として、誇りに思います。今後ますますのご活躍を期待します。応援📣してます。最後に怪我には、くれぐれも気をつけて下さい。
本当にメジャーに挑戦してくれて良かったと思う
大谷翔平！
あのバットの乾いた音よ笑笑
More and more impressed every game! MVP!
Angels wasting away Ohtani and Trout man if they don't win a world series in the next two years let these guys go and get a ring.....Trout needs to have at least 2 rings before he ends his career.
おおたに！最高だな！！
The dude who bats after ohtani looks homeless
大谷優勝や！
Disgusting!
大谷さーん！最高😚 日本の誇り🥰

He using breathing techniques from demon slayer no cap
Iglesias always there, to greet him!
He's almost as good as me!
BABE OTHANI
Otahni, Tatis, Acuna, Guerrero all better be in the derby but no .
미쳤네
Wait,Ohtani. I can't  believe yet the existence of 30 hr hitter pitching as a starter....
his single hit ＝ homerun
Does Shohei need to appear in Home Run Derby?  Every day is a Home Run Derby!
オオタニサンのニュース多くて嬉しいよ
This season's anime is too fantasy and boring....
Yeah , make 30 homer is common.  But he is pitcher!!!
I guess this is his break out year!
やばすぎ

大歓声ほんとに鳥肌立つな　MVPコールもすごい　日本にいた時から規格外だとは思ってたがアメリカでも規格外とは…🦄🦄🦄🐐🐐🐐 そして子ども達がはしゃいでる姿が微笑ましすぎる🥰
Almost 65 years old and I think he may very well be the finest baseball player I have ever seen.
So you've never seen a player with power to both sides of the field??? 🤔🤔
Babe Ruth who 🤯
MLB is too easy for Ohtani
3:30 The best reaction!
And that’s yet another reason why I follow the Angels ;)
Ohtani didn't curtain call because to him it was no big deal, it wasn't difficult to reach 30
怪我だけはしないでくれ
Monster
He needs to play in a World Series
The craziest thing is that angels stadium is relatively hard to hit HRs in. Someone overlaid the stadium dimensions with all of shohei’s hits this season, and If shotani was with the Yankees, he would already have 40 home-runs!!
I raised Ohtani.
Imagine having 2 of the best generational talents in MLB history during their primes ON THE SAME TEAM just to finish 3rd place in the division every year. The Angels need trout back and more so they need solid ace starter
The only problem is he came to the wrong team...🤷
Well, in all fairness, a nine year old girl can hit home runs off Oriole pitching
This is insane! It's like a videogame! Ohtani is unbelievable as a batter till u realize he's an elite pitcher.
Most Valuable Player
いろんな道での一里塚になってほしい人物
How come his eyes are so round?
“I’ve never seen anything like this!” How about Barry Bonds?
大谷翔平は人間をやめたんだよ。つまり大谷翔平は性格の良いディオブランドー。 天性のカリスマ性に高い知性と学習能力、ズバ抜けた運動センス、ジョナサンのように強靭な肉体。と愛嬌まで併せ持つ。 そして時を止めるスタンド能力により承太郎が現れない限り無敵の支配者として君臨する運命なのじゃよ。
부럽다 일본
歴史的な出来事を目にすることができて幸せだ どれだけ多くの人に感動と勇気を与えているんだろうか

He's a big guy and with some good ability. Give me 8" more in height and I'd show what I could do.
'GOD'tani~
REALメジャー\(//∇//)\茂野吾郎さん超え
Big Flyyyyy Ohtaniii Saaaaan
もう覚醒やろ
I'd like someone to write a letter of recommendation to Ohtani to join AVENGERS !!
This guy does things that Albert Pujos did when he first came up. Hits any kind of pitch from any trajectory, velocity or location with power to any and all parts of the ballpark.
진화한다  야신으로.
There is no doubt. He is currently the best player in Major League Baseball.
3:21
Salute who found him and brought to mlb🥰
As an 😇 Angels fan it is so satisfying to know we have Ohtani in our team. ❤️
👍
Shohei, Vlad Jr. and Tatis sure make some great faces of the league. Soto and Acuna Jr. too! Its very nice to see an asian dominating a north american league!
He is not human… This man is so fun to watch
MLB needs to ban him from the game because he makes everyone else so pathetic. all the sudden baseball looks unfair.
Good Golly Miss Molly !!!
왼손타자기 왼손투수 몸쪽 꽉찬 하이패스트볼을 저렇게 쉽게 넘길수 있나? 난 처음본다

Angels can't afford sign him next contract. MLB gona sign him to 1 billions  contract. N have him on MLB loco
んー、 なんだろ そんな簡単にホームラン打つのやめてもらっていいすか？
Best player in the game right now.Could be for a long time.
thank you for being born in japan. i,m proud of the japanese
Ohh man I love his swing at the bat! At the speed rate he is hitting home runs I think he will reach a very high number.
I can't remember his last single hit besides the bunt hit.  This must be some sort of a record for sure!!!
Greatest season of any modern day player
ホームランと四球だけで打率を上げる男
コメント欄の英語はわからないけど、きっと大谷の凄さで大喜利しまくってんだろうな
Not only Shohei, all teammates are also shining... Go Angels!! From 🇯🇵
So...what's the title of this movie
メジャーのおかわり君
He is on pace for 62 home runs. And unlike Bonds and MaGwire... no roids here!
Sugoi
대단하다는 말밖엔,...
OHTANI IS GOD!!!!!!
Amazing. Pains me the two greatest baseball players on Earth have to be Angels though. They need rings.
Not only the HR but also the bottom of the ninth inning was won by Otani's great success.
Yankees should trade Stanton, Judge, and Sanchez for this guy. Heck, throw in LeMahieu. How about it Angels?
I'm going to see him on 8/11 because they're giving away free Ohtani shirts, hopefully I can get one and watch him hit another home run! I bought my seat at right center field section, I used to watch him back in 2018 and he was already awesome but not as crazy as now.
보면 볼수록 너무 대단하고 멋진 선수. 진짜 역대급 선수인 듯
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. This guy is better than Babe Ruth.
大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！大谷最強！
Vladdy: hits 27th Shohei: Okay, fine. No problem.
トラウトの分まで打ってるでは無いか？(笑)
I think Ohtani hit so many home runs that he forgot how to pitch a few days ago.
MVP Superman
MVP Godzilla
오타니...당신은 도대체... 너무 좋아..
He is our hope to live🤤
日本の誇り！楽しそうでこっちまで嬉しい！おめでとう😆
Is this real life?!  He's the feel good story of the decade.  WOW
I knew that comeback was gonna be amazing....he is the best player out there!!
Shohei best pitcher hitter runner ATM for angels. Wouldnt be surprised best fielder and catcher too lol
The 1st one looked like the one against the white sox that went 117 off the bat
A pitcher with 30 homers before the all-star break!!  Incredible!  I think Ruth hit 29 his last season as a pitcher so Ohtani has passed him.  It was. Ice to see the team answer and pick him up his latest outing.  They knew Ohtani has done so much for them that now it was their turn to help him out.  So he is making this team play better.  Not to be Captain Obvious but he is something special.  Glad I got to witness it.  I only wish my dad could have seen this.
盗塁12も地味に凄くないか？
「惨敗の後、バットで払拭出来るか」こんな不安ごとかっ飛ばしてくれた。
Ohtani hits homeruns as easily  as i strike out!!!!!!!
The rest of the Angels got Shohei's back the last game, Shohei's got theirs today!
大谷真的是Mvp日本投手投砲，把上次先發投不好的成績補回來
勝った！9回大谷四球出塁→盗塁→ウォルシュヒット→大谷激走スライディングで勝ち越し生還❗️感動した MLBさん動画UPいつも早い🤣続きあるよ編集お願いします　This is ShowTime
Just let him play baseball  He's born for that
I can’t wait till trout and he are on the field together again. I think otani just evolved when trout got hurt.
こりゃあもう一本打つなと思ったら打った
Until last game : Is he human? Last game : Oh,He is actually human. Today's game : I take it back.
5:10 those kids reaction are priceless and was exactly like them in front of my TV except I’m in my 30’s. Lol
”HOMEｰRUN PITCHER”

年間60本って… いよいよガチベーブルースやん…
大歓声のMVPコールから打席に入って、逆方向へ逆転ホームラン 格好良すぎる
I love how José Iglesias meets him the same way every time he hits a homer
What a lot of people don’t realize is that Ohtani doesn’t have to pitch like Jacob Degrom and hit like vlady in order to win MVP. He can pitch like Noah Sydergaard and hit like Freddie Freeman and still win an MVP, because why he’s been doing has never been done before.
There will always be an Asian better than you, yes even in sports lol
No wasted movement in that swing.
김하성이 최고다
Ohtani 30 HR Angels 40-41 with playoff implications in question.
HomeRun Pitcher
Can’t wait for his player of the month card in the show.
Did anyone tell him that the Home Run Derby hasn't started yet?
Showtime Ohtani
Give him Mvp already
Crazy man
He’s the best player in the league
Also, walk in 9th, stole second, score the winning run
怪物
He is monster...
I'm so honored to be alive to witness him

MVP! MVP! MVP!👑👑👑
Im a phillies fan but lowkey I wanna get an ohtani jersey
I don't think I'll ever get bored of watching his swings
I love 大谷翔平 forever
I have never watched MLB before this week but have fallen in love with the game just from watching Ohtani
Ohtani san deserves more than 10X package for just hitting, then another 5X for pitching.
And this doesn't include him walking in the 9th inning, stealing a base and scoring the winning run!  What a player!!!!
thirty  for Otani の韻踏んでる感良き
Amazing!! Crazy man👍👍
Just for fun, are gifted lefty hitters better overall than gifted right  handed?  (Side note Mark McGwire is my favorite player)
Change the Ohtani's batting order to fourth~!
Absolutely incredible. Ohtani is on pace for a monster season in the home run category.  If only the Angels were better. This kid deserves a shot in the playoffs.
He's doing things NO alive player has ever done. Ppl say he's the 2nd Babe Ruth, I say he's the 1st Shohei Ohtani.
*MVP!MVP!MVP!*
日本人として誇らしすぎる
Just walk him! lol
MVP
This guy does everything to lead your team to victory. The collision on the plate was hard and the celebrating✊🏼✊🏼😂
Yep, he's on his way to 61 homers for the season.
BTW. Idk if anyone knew, but Mike Trout is also on this team LOL
Can’t wait ‘til trout gets back, they will make for a deadly duo
Home run machine
you know,... I feel it. The Angels is turning into The Super Angels...  very, very impressive win.
And he’s got great attitude, to boot! Gotta love him! Truly incredible player.
I think Ohtani totally misunderstood the meaning of home run derby. lol
How do you pay Shohei? As a hitter or as a pitcher? To whom who you compare him at present? His agent will just sit at the negotiation table and listen to offers and tells suitors " Give me your best offer. "😂🏦🌐.
If Ohtani plays an entire season as a DH or a position player, he might break the home run record that Barry Bonds set with the help of steroids.
THE BASEBALL
Angels just won with Ohtani racing to home beating the throw. He needed all of that speed!
That's a Samurai swing👍
Ohtani just moves different.. Absolutely INSANE
すげー！鳥肌たったぞ！
Our japanese SUPERSTAR!!
打ったらほぼホームランやん、Amazing
なんか、言葉がでない
大谷さーん！
kids are romping happily
hey MLB strike while the iron is hot. the SHO is a must see / indemand right now. even the angels are losing the ratings will be high if nationaly televised.
The excitement i get from watching this guy is insane. Absolute sho-man
流石‼️頑張れ‼️
never heard of the guy till 3 days ago … dayum
Imagine if he was on steriods
It will surpass Hideki Matsui's 31.
Is this guy really a human being, not from other planet?
angels won by shohei's run!!! MVP!!!
Vladdy Jr is killing it. But my god Ohtani is breaking the league
ohtani‘s life is eat,sleep and HR.😹😹
もう誰も止められない
MVP unless Vladdy gets triple clown

WOW Shouhei is amazing!
Ovr:99
An hour after the upload, this video has 62k views.. the other MLB videos loaded around this time have 5k lol. Say what you will of these home runs, Ohtani scored the game winning run legging out a hit that went straight into the right fielder. How is this guy even possible
This is why Ohtani stick to batting...his pitching isn't as good as he thinks
日本の誇り
最後の走塁感動した

オリオールズ投手キーガン• エイキンさんは、大谷翔平さんと勝負をしてくれた。彼は決して逃げなかった。彼の投じた球は、厳しい球だった。優しい球ではなかった。その球を打った大谷翔平さんのパワーは普通ではない｡名勝負だったと私は思う｡
Is it possible to win MVP and Cy Young in the same season     Yes I know degrom will win but ohtani is close
This was the first full mlb game I’ve watched on tv and it was entirely because I’ve seen so many of ohtanis highlights online and wanted to watch him play. This game was absolutely incredible and I’m going to keep watching
goathani
I don't know any adjectives to describe him.
2 HR steal base and bring the run for the win with walshy

what a beast
And he's not all jacked up on roids

sho ya almighty
pitcher : FK this pitcher
Sleep Eat Work Ohtani Daily Homers
I hope shohei can have a great starting game as a pitcher next time.  well done！you changed baseball just the way Curry did to basketball
Will we ever get to see the Angels vs the Mets? DeGrom pitching to Ohtani?
The kids are excited and that means everything!! Bringing dreams back to kids again!! We have a Hero in Ohtani!! Baseball back in balance!
Ridiculous
" Official Othani fan channal "
MVP MVP MVP MVP!

Ohtani　MVP ⭐️MVP　⭐️
I am so astonish that I don't surprise when He hit 2 homeruns in 1 game.
應該請Bruno Mars問一下Ohtani是否也是火星人, 地球人怎麼可能打出那麼多全壘打
Next thing you will hear is Ohtani and Schwarber test positive for drugs.
This dude is unreal
M⚾️V🇯🇵P🙌
I think he should give up pitching and just focus on hitting; I think he could potentially be the best hitter ever and without the use of PED'S.
イグレシアスのお出迎えが可愛い❤️
Sad crowd. Wow. If he was a Cub at Wrigley it would be a madhouse.
This is " The HERO" and Japanese pride. from Osaka Japan
MVP 2021   No question
he is LEGEND!from JP ありがとうショーヘイ🙏🙏🙏 野球の神様に1番愛されてるのは君だ🌏🌏🌏
amazing
Anaheim better not waste this man’s career
The second home run is absolutely, "Textbook!" As I have posted before, I LOVE how Ohtani approaches the ball without a stride and throws his hands through the hitting zone like his teammate Anthony Randone and former All-Star Paul Molitor. Although I was born in Baltimore, this is a swing of beauty to see. A scout taught me the same approach as a prospect and minor league player many years ago and it really works without much loss of power!
The pitcher that gave up the 30th homerun and 2nd of the game didn't even dare to look back.  He would have been foolish to doubt.
The Angels, with Mike Trout and Shohei will have 20 MVP seasons ... and no championships.  What a failure of a front office, I feel so bad for Trout and Ohtani :(
This man and Jomboy have reinvigorated my interest in baseball
Hits two HRs, walks, steals 2nd, and scores winning run in bottom of the 9th.
And he just scored the winning run after stealing 2nd base. Superb base running on top of the 2 homers
The guys a freak of nature
Shohei was super hero in Japan. But now he is super hero all over the world. I didn't expect he became super hero like babe ruth.
home run king shoei..
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
How can you hit a baseball with your eyes half open.😆😅😂🤣
Ohtani personifies what is wrong with baseball today. The game is now primarily about strikeouts and home runs. It's become a less complex game and increasingly reduced to a pitching/hitting duel.
Omg!  Stolen base. Run. MVP MVP MVP
Just can’t get my eyes off you on Screen!
Reminds me to Barry Bonds. Insane swing!
Strikes are dangerous!  Don't throw🥺
The monster
OPS is supposed to amezing
ちょっと理解出来ない！！
Who is mvp this year?
Ohtani starting to let his nuts hang with them bat flips. Lol. Love it
Oh my gosh
Halos got the bats but just need pitching to help out the offense.
At age of 60, I am learning many things from this young man. I meant not only about baseball.
he is the actual goat
gg
Simply the greatest player in AL now.
He makes it look so easy
MVP!!
ヤベェよな
Good move.  Walking the walk off homer. 😅
Everyone gangsta until shohei’s at bat
What a great player I've never seen!
Every time he hits a home run a new born gets named after him
SHOHEI OHTANI#17 IS ALREADY IN HOMERUN DERBY MODE ..
Shohei is not human..
えぐいね
MVP👍
Is his rookie card worth $10,000 ?
なんか向こうの子どもたちが大はしゃぎしてるの嬉しいな
😁
I was suppose to go to this game 😭😭😭 I’m definitely going against the Red Sox.!
전설이네.,
Greatest Of All Time Ohtani GOATani
ニュース見るだけで毎日気持ちいい。ありがとう大谷😭
At this point I think even rival teams' fans want to see him go as far as possible.
大谷　パワフルプロ野球だと能力エグくなりそう
Watching degrom and ohtani pitch and hit is unbelievable lol so special
やるの〜
盗塁王は諦めよう。 彼は堂々とダイヤモンドを一周する事が出来てしまう。 Let's give up on him getting a SB leader.   He can slowly go around the diamond .
ohtani showed he is no.1 slugger in japan. hope to get MVP and HR king!
GAMBATE!
日本の誇り
🗾🇯🇵!
大谷さんここのチャンネルMLBの公式チャンネルなんですけど？🤣
I thought I confirmed that Ohtani was also human being with his pitching against the Yankees, but I was wrong. He is 🦄.  Go, Ohtani! Go, Angels!
前半戦でMVPコールされる男
At this point I'm much more concerned about his pitching
What a historical freak this guy is!! The Superman!!
He is definitely going to change the meaning and the standard of MVP award if he wins this year.
Thirty-Ohtani
At this rate he’ll have 40 by the end of the second week in July
The two kids will never forget this homerun in their life.
That’s insane!! He crushes again and again.
大谷も凄いけどチームの打撃力も素晴らしい、序盤であれだけやられてもやり返せるのは滅多にない。
MVP! MVP! MVP!
Home Run x2 every day.
incoming drug test

球界の至宝 legendplayer ootanisan!
ohtanisan!!🇯🇵🇯🇵
侍！！！
This is bananas lol.
dude gets full extension on everything. amazing
와오 그냥 미친놈이다 저게 어딜봐서 투수의 스윙이냐
He is a monster.
I would hate to be the batter after shohei. All that pressure every time….
This is what happens when the anime protagonist competes their final training.
this kid  what was that
Never liked baseball until now
It's so crazy watching this guy! Hes like a created player on a video game its *ridiculous* . As a SP to hit this many homeruns and not just "homeruns" he hitting straight BOMBS for 400FT almost every other day. This would be like an NFL QB starting under center and as the starting free safety at the same time while getting a pick 6 *EVERY GAME*
I hope bullying from umpires doesn’t get worse.
I havent done the research but last starting pitcher to lead hr, is it babe ruth? Or is ohtani the first?
Let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MVP⚡️⚡
Are we sure He's even human?
Unbelievable！！！！
RESPECTOhtani
He is on fire
this man is making me watch baseball
Imagine the incentive he will receive by the end of the season. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
sibal....incredible...... he's fantasy
恐怖的左打 可怕的右投..
よっしゃーーーっ！！！！！！！
we're proud of you
頼む。日本までホームランを飛ばしてくれ！
Can’t SB because of HR!
Awesome!!!Shohhei!!!
OOTANI is japanese treasure
He’s just so special to watch.
just Ohtani
GOATANI
3:21 pitcher didnt even see where the ball went
He is special
Lmao Jesus. I bet the other pros playing against him and watching him feel like 💩
Recent hits  HR HR Drag bunt HR HR HR HR HR Drag bunt two-base hit two-base hit three-base hit HR HR HR HR HR HR⇦30 HOME RUN
3:20
I'm gonna be sad if he tests for PEDs. This might be the first non roid user to break the homerun record.
that frame at 1:26 tho
REAL SUPER MAN💯
he makes baseball great again
前半戦で30本はやばい
もうオレの日課は1日の終わりにYouTubeでオオタニサンと検索することだよ
これはもう、アメリカ合衆国政府が大谷を、変な女から守るべきだわw
This guy is already in home run derby 😂😂😂
もうどこ投げたらいいんだよ、 インハイだめでアウトコースをダメか...
Is this a reality?
MVP!!!!!! MVP!!!!! MVP!!!!!
Stg every time I see this dude he’s finishing his home run trot, from his second hr of the game
If he concentrates on batter,  may hit more than 60 hr, but he himself would not want to quit pitcher. For him, baseball is both pitcher and batter.
He can singlehandedly  bring all the fans back
間違いなく歴史を見ている
ゴイス〜🤣しょ〜へ〜い〜🤭😂😂😂😂
thank you Ohtani !!!!  I'm looking forward to it every day!!
So baseball is boring and slow but now ohtani and guerrero are must watch? 98 all over again
World class
I saw Shohei hit the game winning shot the other day against L.A. Clippers. And he had a hole in one at the Masters.   Not only that, but he won Hells Kitchen,  and America's got talent.  Good thing he's in first place in the Tour De France as he avoided that doofus with the sign that knocked everyone over. He even threw a No Hitter... in Darts.
Ohtani is a cheat code. Too bad he is wasting his career on the Angels.
オリオールズ ピッチャー 「何で俺に負けがついちゃんだよ！」 「頼むから、一昨日のエンジェルスの様に逆転してくれ～」
0:56 is that bro hymn by pennywise ?
Aim for his home run ball on either the left or right stand🤪🥳🥰
Ohtani San『I was so frustrated.』
"MVP"
Ohtani is playing MLB the show and has his character to max rating just because he wanted to try it and thought it’d be fun
投手:大谷  打者:翔平 XD
30HR,11SB,  pitcher?
Wow, cannot believe the angels will waste a great year from this kid
Just WOW !!
The MVP of MPV's and an All Star of All Stars. 🌟
nice!!
Godlike!
This is so fun to watch. Theres stars that I hate even tho they're great because they're on another team but with Shohei, it's impossible not to love him
He is a stand user.
God
One day he's gonna be more famous then Mike! Ontani is a beast.
shoohei must go on !
The Sho-Hey Kid
Ohtani? PLEASE come to the north side of Chicago. 🙏🏻
SHIFT ALL YOU WANNNNNNT LMAO
Well We're Might be looking at Our Next AL MVP Ohtani Son!
Ohtani is japanease hero.
It's still July 3rd, right?😅 omg
打撃絶好調やん、目指すは７０本！
Stoppp I want vladdy to be 1st again
Many hittings look like only single or double, but Ohtani always makes balls fly over the wall. What an amazing giant power!
Really funny to watch Redon take a terrible hack first pitch after Ohtani's first HR, and then take an absolute meatball down the pipe first pitch after the 2nd Ohtani HR. LMAO
진짜 대단하다.........느바좋아하지만 메이저리그는 너땜에 본다........ㅎ
Baby Face Monster
Shohei The Money! 올스타 출전에 이어서 홈런30호 돌파 축하합니다 오타니상
They cheer off the crack of the bat like it's the homerun derby. It's streaks like this that fill ballparks at home and away.
Someone tell him this is the hardest sport in the world to be good at.
もう言葉が見つからないんだが、、、 オオタニサン、野球、本当に上手ですね。
This dude is actually Babe Ruth
Vlad is in bad luck this year, his opponent is Shohei.
Imagine him being in the national league and only pinch hitting! Head a beast
Waiting for a “ Shohai Can You See” call…
MVPやろ！
About 10 days left until the All-Star game. And I just searched about players approaches 30hr by all star break The best was Barry Bonds' 39hr If he gets just 3hr, 8th in all time.  He's crazy now.
He’s practicing for the home run derby!
Unbelievable wow!
Is he gunna get to 62?!!
He is crazy...
相手のピッチャーは悪くない 大谷が凄いだけ
Story of living legend is just beginning.
#日本林安可
Angels are wasting Ohtani and Trout. They need to invest in pitching
guerrero jr: sorry daddy
MLB is weak, compared to 甲子園
He’s why I watch. MLB needs to market their golden goose.
オオタニサイコー！
He is the best high fastball hitter in the game, most everybody else gets dusted. He smacks high heat all day long.
5:10 a player who makes kids happy is the most valuable because kids are the future of the game.
People marvel at Ohtani’s home runs. I’m one of them. Besides his home runs, I enjoy watching the pitchers’ reactions. On contact, some of these pitchers freeze and look at him like, ‘I can’t believe you just hit that!’
ヤバっ、またホームラン、いつものホームラン、次はバントヒットお願いします。
can you post videos  about other people shohei is awesome but theirs other players in league
OHTANI Vs. Degrom
Angels in the outfield type vibes
UNREAL! No one saw this coming in baseball.
毎日YouTube開くたびに大谷さんホームラン打ってるな笑
Ohtani is Korean
マジですか、、たらればですが打者に専念していたら７０本打ってたかもしれない。 毎日の楽しみですよ。
When the Angles get rid of Pujols salary next year then they can finally afford some pitchers.
Agree or disagree but I don’t think he’s gonna do well in the derby
shohei or matt olson for the June monthly awards in Mlb the show 21
Ok ok…. Let’s not forget Ichiro who had 10 straight 200 hit seasons from start of career including breaking  ALL TIME season hit record of George Sisler from 1920!!!!!!!!!!!! Jus sayin…. Japan has lent us some great stars….we need to appreciate them. Luv me some Othani, even tho I’m an A’s fan!  MLB REALLY needs to promote Trout and Ohtani….
ＭＶＰ
He is a home run machine 👽
I'm more happy for the kids. That's what baseball is all about!
미국도 야구시즌 끝날때 쯤엔 매미채 등장하겠구나~~
Iglesias must be exhausted
I mean what are you supposed to do against that guy?
MVP
This dude is electric
VLAD: I'm right there again for the HR crown!!  SHOHEI: hold my sake!!😀
Ma man is on Fire 🔥🔥
This is insane !
たまらん、日本の宝だ。 毎日元気くれてありがとう！
Love Iglesias’ enthusiasm!
日本人が世界で活躍していて嬉しいです。
What is the name of that anime?
HR30? Heh. That's baby steps. Come back once you get to some real G-Rank quests.
Its july 2nd and he has 2 Homers in july lol
Monster,he did it for the whole  baseball world ,just give him the MVP.
Otani is Baseball! Not a human being.
Avengers???
チームが勝つには大谷を歩かせるのは妥当な作戦だが、ホームランダービーでトップで、打つ所を動画で撮りたいファンがこんなに沢山では、投手も逃げられない雰囲気だよ〜
He's playing real life baseball like MLB the show career mode
野球の基本は ホームランと三振
MVP！MVP！
The Angels picked him up last game, he picked them up tonight.
Incredible!! The Chosen one ☝ 👑
Give this guy the MVP already!
He should hit and pitch in the all star game. Why not?
He can reach 60 homers at this rate⚾👍
Shohei Ohtani actually makes me excited to watch baseball again just to see what he does next. Once in a hundred years superstar!
Imagine if they had a quality pitching rotation and bullpen.
MVP😍
He have to stopping pitching. Only batting zone
MVP
Fan fact: he is a pitcher
(*^o^)／＼(^-^*)
I'm so proud of him as Japanese!
すんげー
My goodness he’s gonna hit over 60 homers this season!  😮😮😮
Ohtani !! You're just unbelievable!
かっこよすぎる…
Ohtano could rail me fr
His physical abilities aren't human
It’s a dream..
Ohtani Jr.>Tatis Jr.+Guerrero Jr.+Acuna Jr.
MVPを彼にあげて 信じられないくらいHRうつんすよ。この人
incredible power!!
もう、、どうにでもして 過去にこんな選手みたことない
He is a Samurai
Howw
Incredible.... and to be a pitcher! ⚾👍
Amazing! This guy is Babe Ruth.
ほんだ ごろう？
炎上を引きずってないから不安だったから、ホッとした。
60 HR , 2.50 ERA ,  9K per game
もう笑っちゃうわww
Remember, the HR record for a pitcher in a season is 39!  He could do it by the All-Star break!
BUILT DIFFERENT!
Look at that joy of the children
미쳤다 진심!
He’s in another league!! Baby face monster
6 ft 4
Please come to the Mets 😭😭😭😭
Picked up by Shohei Ohtani at the birth, the new born baby is already satisfied with his life completely, and started digging his own grave with a shovel...
Ochinpo Joinus
60 home runs/ year
My Orioles need him....................Badly
Ohtani for ALL ALL for Ohtani
Trout is overrated Ohtani is carrying LAA
明後日の誕生日もホームラン打って欲しいな
Jeez cheese
MVP‼︎
もう2本目なんかピッチャーが打球の行方を振り返りすらしなかった
This dude legit needs a PED test lol 13 HR in 15 games 🤔🤔🤔
ARIGATO GOZAIMASU！ OHTANI SAN！！   from Japan.
すごすぎます。言葉にならないぐらいすごい！！
Amazing person...
Love Iglesias greeting him every HR!
https://youtube.com/shorts/PDvIJ70nvSk?feature=share
Single hit: 25 Home run: 30 That's incredible
He isn't Japanese.🥲😂🤣
He is ridiculous
He's a good pitcher but damn. 30 is a big number.
He hits nothing but absolute bombs.  No cheapies.
It's called "YABAI!!!!"  in japanese.
すごE
I guess he’s decent
Man, he is just out of this world...the only other player I can remember like this was Barry Bonds, and he was on roids' and didn't pitch!
Yakultがいっぱいｗ
OPS1.4！？
神だ！
😳😳😳
If Ohtani breaks out of this slump, he might get 70 home runs.
should home runs vs Orioles count?
5:10 little girl looking at the best play ever rn and she doesn’t even know
Kids really happy got nice handy baseball guy 🙂
Guys it's not even the all Star break yet and he's already at 30 HR ....the Barry bonds 73 HR( *which was kinda impossible till now ) is kinda within reach of he continues at this rate for the rest of the season....I hope he does 🤞🤞
Angels fans! Now is the time to learn to write his name in Japanese. 大谷！！
ピッチャーがかわいそう
Wow！　He is the pride of Japan^^
And the Angels are still under .500  Hopefully he won't be dumb enough to sign a lifetime contract like Trout did.
Just walk him vs Angels... He is locked in
매일 치냐ㅋㅋ
OPS🤔
This is bonkers!!  💥😲💥
The AL MVP is going off today
ホームラン6～7本離したら、投手の調整に2～3日休もう、それ見たMLBの反応凄いだろうね
Another day another Ohtani highlight reel shows up in my recommended list. 👍
Alright guys, I know how to stop this man already... use kryptonite !!
He's hitting homeruns like news broadcasting. He's doing it everyday.
Dude is on 🔥! I can't wait to see him in the homerun contest at the All-Star game. He is a special player and fun to watch! Hopefully the Angels can start winning and make it to the playoffs.
Did anyone tell him that the homerun derby hasn't started?
Vladdy will catch up
Too bad the team's in last place!😞
Otani is a korean😊😊
맞자마자 존나 시원하게 날아가네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 개멋있다
Dude loves crushing first pitch
30……OHTTANI👍👏🙏💪❤😱
Ohhh------------30
OMG
・０．
Japanes monster, "Inoue"and"Ohtani"
I've said before and I'll see it again ALL HAIL SHOHEI OHTANI
And wont see a single postseason game in his career.  Angels wasting yet another generational talent
개쩐다 ㅁㅊ
MARVEL should add Otani to the X-men.
God damn... This man.
Shohei and degrom live in different dimension.
Mike who?🤣🤣🤣
Japanese Monster ！🇯🇵
MVP🙌
I don't know. Maybe it's time to lift my moratorium on watching the Angels. AMAZING YOUNG MAN!
0:30 ⚾️ 3:21 ⚾️⚾️
i think this type of sport should not be named "baseball", it should be named "Shohei Ohtani".
oh my god...Amazing player
Alien
花火って えぇなぁ～！ やっぱ ホームって えぇなぁ～ 😇
He might break bonds record for most in a season at some point
look at the Angels stadium filled with a lots of Angels fans. even though Angels now is at not good position, but fans never give up and come to see the game. How much it would encourage players. plus definitly Ohtani brought many people back to baseball. Go Angels!!!!
JAPAN!!!
MVP! MVP! MVP!
大谷が笑顔でよかった。
10年後大谷は今よりも不調になってるはずで久々のホームランとか打ったらコメント欄は全盛期の大谷は1打席3本ホームラン打てたとかで溢れそうだな〜それくらい印象に残るホームラン打ち続けてる
MVP!!
またまたまたまたまたまたまた打ったよ。この子は......
嬉しそうな一平さんの笑顔がいっちゃんすき
Only reason I watch baseball SHOTIME
I feel sorry for Rendon batting after him. Dude hitting tons of runs but no RBI for him :(
real MVP
babe ruth 29HR with 30ks in 1919, ohtani 30HR with 83ks in 2021,
I love how the helmet always looks huge on him like its going to fall off but he is a huge guy hahaha
I really can’t believe what we are witnessing, enjoy this while you can.
MLB THE SHO
コロナで苦しい中、日本に勇気と希望をありがとう。
2021/June/3   Syouhei  is　crying.  Why.
Fernando Tatis Jr. Ronald Acuña Jr. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shohei Ohtani Hr.
沒事請常念羅迪文不要幹夠，羅迪文說他一百公尺跑9秒，在公速公路開車都開200市區開100，然後說家裡有沙漠之鷹，高中是萬人迷
Shohei oh kami.( Kami means god)
I'm a Rangers fan and I hate the Angels - but I do what Ohtani highlights whenever.  He's truly doing something great to watch.
He is the “Goro shigeno “
I did a grand slam with ohtani and It was the bottom of the 9th I was losing 7-8 but that grand slam saved me at the end
Ohtani is so good he’s such a cheat
He is not going to be AL MVP 2021, but ML MVP 2021
Lionel Messi, LeBron James, Floyd Mayweather,  Tiger Woods and Shohei Ohtani!!!!!!!!!
Wow.  That’s all I have to say lol
I thought Dwight Gooden was a good hitter cause he might hit 2 HR's a season.
Fun fact : ohtani is a pitcher competing in the home run derby and mvp votes
Ohtani「First Wake Up Call for Japanese.」 Japanese「💤」 Ohtani「Wake Up Call again‼︎」 Japanese「⁉︎」
百年難得一見奇才.根本是從漫畫中走出來的人物.現實中找不到.大谷翔平.值得喝采.加油.
5:05 The home run trajectory of a white ball that crosses through the breathtaking purple sky. Baseball is art.
위대한 일본인이네요....
MVPコールに泣けてくる
To tell the truth,he is a twins...
日本人は毎朝、グッドニュースで起床する。♪
Every Ohtani AB should be televised live on ESPN for the rest of the season. This is literally history in the making. Its been 100 years for crying out loud.
I don’t care who you are if your a fan of baseball you gotta love that guy.
damn...
3:53 Bruh.. You also pitch better than me.
this is the popular anime line.  lost cofidence once and "to be continued.." and recover it and get much tougher...
This dude bats like he's gonna get cut if it doesn't leave the yard😅🙌🏼
Imagine shohei getting to 60 home runs
日本の誇り
もうこんな事が出来るのは又大谷が やる以外現れないな❕
What type of liberal hack gives this a thumbs down?
he is japan's tesure
5:11 男の子たち「うおおおおおおおお」 女の子「（もう帰りたい…）」
31号打ってた松井秀喜の凄さが改めて際立つ。
The game is not done. Might get 3rd HR
He is specialᕙ( ˙꒳​˙ )ᕗ
何で俺たちが、ヤンキース戦のうっぷんをはらされないといけないの？
Imagine if ShoTime hits 60 HR's and completes his season on the mound with a sub 3.00 ERA. Nuts!
Making up for that rough start the other day, jeez.
Woooooooooooooow!!!!
やはり此奴は怪物だな。
MVP
球場で見れてる人ほんと羨ましいぜ。
Let's not call him monster because we are sure that monster can't do what he does.
Flexible…
ｷﾀ━━━━(;ﾟдﾟ)━━━━!!
freak
There is huge Pujols fan here
Angels need pitching and they're set!!!!
２日続けて皆をがっかりさせた事が無い❗MVPコールの直後に打ってしまうのは凄すぎる‼️
Shohei is like the real version of cartoon character described somewhere
MVP
Second fastest to reach 30HRs in a season!
Feel bad to whoever has to bat right after Ohtani.
he's not a human
もう30号wえぐすぎやん Fantastic!!
Are you avengers  ?
笑死
It would be an absolute sin against God and a crime against humanity if Shohei doesn't win the MVP.
あめいじんぐ…アメイジング…Amazing！！！  Is  he a SAMURAI？　 What  a Japanese…
I wish Dodgers get him.
So different watching him do this compared to watching when Bonds did it.   Ohtani seems like a down to earth, decent human being.  Bonds?   Not so much.
Iglesias almost kissed him this time 😆
MVP！MVP！
息をするようにホームランを放つオオタニサン。
WOW WOWwow‼️ SHOHEY❗️morning shot again & again❗️incredible ❗️MVP just like that !
It's so beautiful to see you swing when you hit a home run.
1打席前の余韻すら我々には与えないのか！  神よ！
Your going respect this man!
オオタニサン最高
The bat speed is crazy.
This guy's going to have more home runs than team wins this season, SMH.
This guy is on another planet.
5:11 Excited boys and uninterested girl
This man is unreal fr
太強了！
Big fly Ohtani san!!!
Awesome
I LOVE Othani ♥️
Can you imagine being Vlad or Tatis and getting beat by a pitcher?? Just wild
アンリビーバボー！ (笑) トラウトが居ない時に凄い活躍ぶり。これでトラウト帰ってきたら
MVP
오타니 만세 만세 만만세~~👍
The pitcher is the first player to hit 30 homeruns
And he bounced back to back to---- (he might make more)😁
Not impressed, carry on....
superstar🏆
Super Super Sugoi!
MVP!!!!
I'm Japanese.   Shohei is the pride of Japan.  However, he may not be Japanese.  He is an alien.
Yeehaw 🤠
Shohei is a legend baseball player.
I'm addicted to the sound of the ball coming off his bat.
5:10 女の子興味なくて草
ピッチャーの人の表情が、、 人生がかかってるもんね、、厳しい世界
MVP OHTANI
ShoPEDS
What kind of training arc is he going through for the Home Run Derby?
Broadcasting is good, but I really want to go to angel stadium from Japan to see it.
Someone check him for steroids
just a spectacular baseball player...wow.
He is a No.1baseball player in the world!!!!!!!!!!!
DON'T WASTE YOUR SUPER POWER AT THE ANGELS... YOU MIGHT WIN THE MVP, BUT MISS THE PLAYOFF.. WHAT A INCREDIBLE SEASONS
30本が通過地点だなんて信じられない。。。 オオタニサンなら60本も夢じゃないかもしれない。
MVP(⌒,_ゝ⌒)
LEGEND
mvp
The man who loves baseball is loved by baseball.
Otani, Home Run Derby isn't held every day ...
神之打擊
Hey Angles fans in LA.  Go to the front office and tell them not to have OHTANI pitch anymore from here.  What is wrong with Angles management=)
Mvp!
He came from another planet.
I’m in love with this dude 🤤🤤
I don't even get it man
もうなんと言えばいいか...凄すぎて鳥肌...午後も仕事頑張るぞー！
oh..my...god..
汚名返上ってやつか
Gotta think of a new title for this same content everyday...
Nobody can stop him Shohei is clearly BEYOND OUR EXPECTATION
Imagine if they were using the old baseballs
Is it posable???
Hey kids! You are the boys of the match.
Angels fans will be happy today
新ベースボールの神様、大谷翔平様✨
He hits more homers than singles, crazy
Only stat they didn’t show was era because it went up 1.02 runs last outing
First the Japanese gave us Godzilla , now this!
Is he a human?😮😮
His name isn’t Shohei Ohtani, that’s just the two names he picked for his batting and pitching archetypes.
He gonna break single season home run record this year
These pitchers really keep trying to pitch him up and in. You'd think they'd learn by now
MVP from a Astros and Rangers fan
国民栄誉賞は間違いない！！     断るかもしらんけど
Ohtani doesn’t understand how this game is hard for other people
I don't know why, tears drop down on my cheeks. Shohei, you're already one of the greatest baseball player!!
Shohei Ohtani~~Shohei Ohtani~~
He'll hit 50 for sure🏆
This guy reaches HR record with Ken Griffey Jr. and A. Rod before all star break!
It's high time he should graduate from MLB like NPB and go to GALAXY LEAGUE!  as the representative of our earth. The spaceship & like that league, if possible.
スゲー経済効果やな。
Third homerun might be coming today. I wonder how many homeruns he will hit before the All-Star game. I'm sure he'll win next game as a pitcher.
Game is not over yet
Last 14 games: OPS 1.464
This is why yesterday's match was cancelled.
Wow
選手名知らないけど、毎回大谷さんがHR打ったらベンチから笑顔ニコニコで出迎えてくれる選手が好きすぎる
3:31 agree with you men.
Come on MLB, don't upload the same video from a few days ago.  Wait, #29 and #30?  Oh... this is new.  AMAZING.
The pride of Japan 🇯🇵
アメリカの野球ファンの皆様、どうか松井秀喜の事を忘れないでプリーズ。
Othani win home run derby
60  otani.despues 73 abajo bonds
Doing it all without Mike Trout in the lineup
Shohei is literally the only reason to watch American baseball these days. I couldn’t even name another player except maybe deGrom and Aaron Judge.
30!
Where the "big fly ohtani-san" go?
大谷の後のレンドーンがちょっとツボ笑
This could become like the Sosa - McGwire  home run race. Except for 1 little exception.
OMG.  OMG.  He is awesome!
bbc
btw his name shohei comes from great samurai in japan.
好像.....可以直接頒全壘打王，然後用心投球
凄すぎる・・・ 日本人の誇りです ホント
.. He's special.
This is his routine anymore.
He’s like Barry Bonds without steroids. Or you can say he’s Steph Curry of baseball. When he’s at bat, we expect a HR lol
Who love this guy??
he simply the best
These days, Rensom feels so lonely at the batter's box.
1回途中でKOされても引きずらず、すぐこの活躍するんだから凄いわ
He hits homers to maintain hit percentage above 0.25
Ichiro still a better batter 🥴🤙 😬
sho-time
MVP!!!!
Absolutely bonkers
Seeing is believing.
superstar athlete but that is the most loaded bat in MLB history. its not even close. he might as well walk up there w/ an aluminum bat.
리얼 사기캐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Thank you for my dream and hope.
As an angels fan he needs to be traded cause his talent is being wasted
Who is Mike Trout?
En 2 años yankees lo contrata!!!
never knew it was so easy to hit home-runs...
At some point, Ohtani is going to get a barrage of walks-- the Barry Bonds treatment.
he is baseball
彼のバットには神がやどっているよ
It is Shohei Goatani！
He is a high school level batter
It's funny or sad to see that Rendon at bat is disturbed by the recap of Ohtani homer.
MLB hasn't had a player like this since babe.. Incredible!
ㄱ ㅆ  간지   졸라 믓지네
Eat. Sleep. Home run. Repeat
Congratulations! 💐🎆Go to the Yankees !!
Trout, DeGrom and Otani are baseball aliens.  Help the Earth, Tatis, Guerrero, Darvish!
OHTANI IS ANGRY BECAUSE OF HIS START LAST MATCH SO HE POUR IT IN HIS BAT
OMG the man is Mr. Automatic now. I mean he just IS.
Shohei will be the best player as a pitcher and a batter!! Now, he become the best batter and we're looking forward to seeing his best pitch.
ほんとに同じ人間なのか？
ビックフライ　オオタニサン～ー✌️
笑死 投球被打爆只好打爆投手來洩恨 !
Shohei Ohtani is on pace for 60 homer’s! WOW 🤩.
shohei MVP👏
Shohei Ohtani is the savior baseball needed. He's making the game fun again.
MVP
Likr i said before, and is still saying now. This is a freakin anime.
Is he a video game character used cheat codes?
子供がピョンピョン❗w
大谷翔平預定2021美聯MVP
He is alien.
30 before the break! All eyes will be on the homerun derby this year. He’s playing like an MVP
At 3:23 the pitcher already knew that was gone. He didnt even have to look at the ball leave the stadium
I can't imagine the pressure he must feel now every time he steps up to the plate.
omgggggggggg
2021  年間最優秀選手賞
I always love Iglesias greeting Ohtani... He is just cute😍
日本では、オリンピック強行開催、政府の暴走、ＫＫ問題など、イライラするニュースばかりですが、オオタニサンのニュースは楽しくて、嬉しくて、ワクワクします！日本の誇りであり、希望でもあります！
Is he a gift from the baseball god? No. He's The baseball god!⚾️
Roids not relevant here.
Ohtani "It's easier than a single"
神がかってる
i m so sorry for youtubers... no summer vacation for you 😌
If he ain't MVP, I don't know who is...
He’s so bad at hitting singles.
what a beautiful 30th homerun is!!
Man is on a mission to hit 50+ home runs this year! 🔥🔥
u wanna know how to work a pitcher just watch Shohei.....
この人に何回鳥肌立たせられるんや
Is it real?? I think so even for Japanese...
GOATani✌️✌️✌️

How can you describe this man?
Who's Mike Trout 😉
Yippeeeeee...shohei is cool
Not a good year for Pitchers indeed
After being KO’Ed by Yankees they say “He’s human” After 30th HR they say “He’s not human” WHICH IS CORRECT
Unbelievable. Unreal, it's ADreams 4　all  the baseball funs!
Beautiful ！Beautiful arch！
Watch the joy on the faces of those 2 kids.  Priceless.
神
'Must see' Ohtani
日本から応援してるぞ！
Insane
I am absolutely speechless I can’t find any more words to say how amazing he is
Shohei the money!
Nasty thirty!!
GOATANI SHOHEI
俺のテスト期間大谷鑑賞で終わる気がする
MVP-to-be Ohtani. 'Nuff said.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he got to 60 or even close to 73
MVP‼️
これが大谷だーーーーー！！ 凄い、凄すぎる。歓声を聞いてると鳥肌が立って、涙が出そうになる。
proud of japan ⚾️
LETS GO OHTANI
"It is the first season since I joined MLB that I can finally give my 100% without worrying about my body." - Shohei Ohtani.  So happy to see that he is finally in good shape and enjoying baseball. Go Shohei!
A pitcher has not hit this many home runs since ruth did with the red sox, this is something to see
Back-to-back home runs for the undeniable Shohei Otani!
*cough* 7 runs on first inning *cough*
Proud of Asia! アジアの誇り！亚洲的骄傲!
Super Japanese!
낭만 그 자체

MVP
5:03 give the camera man a thumbs up for tracking the ball and finding those 2 kids.
すごい素敵だ素晴らしい格好いいりっぱだ。
Ohtani is a beast and is such a fun and exciting player to watch.
3:53 That face lol 😂
Waiting for the day he hits one out and the fans don't even react to anymore.  Another one?? come on man.... hit a single.
OMG 🙀🙀
I can't believe the pitcher took a shot   when it had a risk to get lead the score
For Stephen Curry!!!! For the Golden State Warriors!
If Next year's show game is not called " The Sho" they should lose the MLB license.
SMVP. Super MVP.
트라웃 류현진 양현종 이 셋만 있었다면 지구우승 확정아니었나..
Angels front office is a joke. Get pitching for Trout and Ohtani. You guys are waisting your position players.
オオタニサン！！！！
Shohtani Does it again, Amazing.
미쳤네....
Impressive this kid 😯
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
大谷祭りじゃんか。
Let’s go angels
그냥 만화 주인공 just cartoon.... マンガ少年
Unbelievable
Unpopular opinion I'm sure, but I think Ohtani should focus on becoming a full time position player to ensure he has a long MLB career. He's already had knee surgery and tommy john surgery in his young career and is still struggling with command of his pitches. I think he could be one of the greatest home run hitters of all time if he focused solely on hitting.
God tani
It would be an absolute travesty if he doesn’t win MVP
I take back what i said the other day ,, othani is not human
Wow, just wow. Such a talented player with incredible skills both off and on the mound. Mvp of the year. The fact he can make any pitch a homerun is insane.
MVP❗️❗️
※日本では投手3冠の個人タイトルを獲得しました。
SHOHEI OH-MIGHTY
I don't know why pitchers are pitching him up all of a sudden. He will swing at a pitch down and away like 60% of the time before heating up in June
Too bad he play for the Angels
本当すげぇなぁ
もう意味がわからない
M V P ! !
This dude is living tissue over a metal endoskeleton 💪🏾
Congrats, Shohei ! You are making new history.
高校生のくせに、強すぎるじゃないか
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before 草
Crazy!  Just crazy!
No big deal.  Just a high school hitter who never seen a good curve ball.  Plenty of two-way players out there
怪物
Babe Ruth seems to have come to the Angels Stadium☘️✨
BIG FLY OHTANI SAN
MVP
Most home runs by a Asian born player is Hideki Matsui with 31, Ohtani has 30 and it is only July 2.
Shohei ＝（Ichiro +Matsui）× 2
Shohei takes it out on other pitchers after Ohtani ' s poor performance.
Shotime
It would be great for all of baseball if ohtani faces Degrom.  I know a world series between these two teams is pretty far off but we got to see these 2 go
元気そうで良かった！ 試合でホームランダービーしてるね 大谷MVP🦄
I guess he is back to carrying.
Jesus Christ 🤯
Should wait until the end of the game to upload cuz he might get more tonight lol.
He's rested and it shows!
3:02のバット回しかっこよすぎ
First
This man hits a home run to breathe.
Dudes going to have 60 HR and a 3.00 ERA, ridiculous
Ohtani is amazing.
I live in Garden Grove California and the Angels are my team. I don't even watch baseball anymore I just go on YouTube and watch this dude crush homeruns lol I love hearing the pop off the bat then the oohs and ahhs. The second pitcher didn't even bother to turn around haha
a pissed off Ohtani is a scary hitter
We are witnessing the GOD of baseball or the GOD of sports ?
天才
@MLB please stream all Angels games!
大谷は日本の誇りです🇯🇵
The Sho ain't over! (even though sportscenter and the rest of the ESPN stooges disagree)
AL MVP.
MVP for sure
New nickname for Ohtani: ALL MIGHT
凄すぎる
I hope he reaches 50HR. He can rewrite history.
いつも元気をもらってます！ありがとう翔平！ You always cheers me up. Thank you, Shohei.
He is monester
🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
MLB's Monster, Ohtani  Boxing's Monster, Inoue
AL MVP
Ay coño
There are something missing on him, the limit
Mr.Incredible
どんだけぇー！
Shohei: “Want to see me do a HR? Want to see me do it again?”
unreal
The best baseball player on the earth🌎
After hitting No. 29, the stadium fans at the next at bat and all the fans watching the broadcast are eager for a "home run", and a superstar who realizes it and hits No. 30.
It's sad to see him batting a homerun, get exited, and then seeing the score and notice the Angels are losing by 10. What a joke the Angels are...
Just like the ex girlfriend
MVP
He is king of baseball.
I love Shohei so much❤️
Mr. ShoTime YESS!!! Still salty about how the Yankees fans treated him the game before, so EAT IT! lol
I think he has eclipsed his own teammate in Trout as the best player in baseball
Wao Wao Wao
He is really up for all star ⭐️
tvgame player
WOW!  No way!!  Incredible!!!
KING
MvP
2 days ago:Angels’ teammates saved Ohtani. Today: Ohtani saves his team.  Edit: Angels won.
He makes us happy every day. He's an exciting player.
SHOHEI OHTANI GETS TO 30 HOMERS!! Shohei Ohtani hits 2 homers to reach 30 before All-Star break!!! 0:29 3:21
Sho me the money!
Not human being
He will hit 60-65 with this pace.
No doubt AL MVP
MLB公式さんも大変だな。頑張ってくれ
Better than vlad
MVP!!
ON PACE FOR MORE THAN SIXTY!! NEVER SEEN BEFORE TALENT
A man who raises batting average with a home run!!!
30th HR in the half of the season, can reach 60th at the end
MVP
MONSTER!!

MVP！!

Waiting for Baseball Bits to make the Year of Ohtani
INCREDIBLE
Human？
Join Lakers next season
MVP!
UNBELIEVABLE!!!
monster
Man is on FIRE right now wow
Shohei Ohtani has proved me wrong. I didn’t think Korean players could be this great in the U.S. Because he does both pitching and batting.
Bruh this guys is in another level! My favorite player no doubt! Just waiting for his games.
are you sure that you've checked that the ball isn't juiced @MLB ?
good. video
