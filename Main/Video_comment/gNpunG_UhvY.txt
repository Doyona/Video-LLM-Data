This Canelo was still hungry for glory
Who is the commentator? That guy was commentating in the 90s.... I need his name
Prime Canelo when he ran through all the super middleweight champs was a monster. Too bad Crawford never faced this canelo.
Here after the Crawford fight to see my king shine 😢
This guy must be the best boxing commentator there is 😮
Commentator was COOKING!!!!!  So much fucking epic!!!!
CiNCO de MAYO 🔥🙏✊
Caleb did the Tommy Hearns sideways shuffle dance. Great to see a rat get KOd.
I'll never understand how you can sucker punch someone at a weigh in and not get arrested for assault.
Canelo masterfully closed the distance with that first left hook
Canelo, when he literally chased the knockout and catched it
Canelo with a great win 💪🏽
I miss the commentary from HBO they had so much charisma the DAZN commentators are horrible.  this fight canelo had with scull wasn’t so great but the commentators didn’t even glow with excitement once canelo became a two time undisputed middle weight champ
Canelo was chasing plant like if he owed him money
Canelo doesn’t get enough respect for this win he had Caleb running from his shots
2 ronda
Were was the height advantage?
Canelo gano
Is that where the term “Face Plant” comes from? Hmmm….
Eso no pudo hacer Benavidez
Weird fight..plant pitter patter and hands mostly down all night.. vs benavidez plant tried to win and then hugged the rest of the night to survive ..plant never hugged vs canelo
🇲🇽Viva mexico
🇲🇽Canelo ko 🇺🇸caleb plant en 11 ronda
Payday for canela😅
And Benavidez couldn't put him away. I don't want to hear "styles makes fights" BS.
This was canelos last fight with the power than won him all these fights. After this his hand injury never fully healed
Horrible stoppage
Caleb plant took a dive 😂
Canelo wins Caleb plants
Plant man i love him so much , Ls wont change my feelings.
Thats why Canelo fucked him up
This one was insane
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
How many boxers can completely sweep a division within a year??  Wow!
Wow Godbless u
Crazy knockout. Plant did good tho
Canelo definitely planted  him😂😂
GOAT
Conelo uprooted the planti..
Canelo! Wow that is an amazing KO
This fight reminds me of Chavez vs Roger Mayweather when Chavez super man punched Roger in the first fight. Canelo will go down as one of the greats 🔥🥊🥊
Plant ran like a lil b***h 😂
I still respect plant even tho im not a fan
I saw a bing and bong. lol 😂😂, that’s what plant said when he ko direll. May canelo should have said that too during post interview
Left hook uppercut uppercut game over
CNelo is old school he stays on the body until late in the fight then goes upstairs,kids today need to learn that body shots body shots,plant was wore out by the 11 from those body shots an canelo went upstairs an k.o. plant
Caleb Plant Would also Knock Jake Paul out.
Trash 😂
This video is legendary .
Mexican beats up white boy 😂
Mexican mentality destroying Plant
Thank god he knocked that cornball out…
0:44 :)))))))
CALEB TOOK A DIVE 🤑🤑🤑
Plant went 12 rounds with " the monster" benavidez but canelo kos plant. And people say canelo is ducking benavidez? GTFOOH!!!
Lmao y’all think Crawford can fuck with nelo
Caleb was running away and looking back, he knew he was getting an ass whoopin, 🤣
How was this considered a TKO?
We need that commentator on all major boxing matches!
Insane video
Thank you Canelo, from someone that just doesn’t like Plant.
Canelo  is the best  boxer ever
“THE CORONATION IS COMPLETE, ALL HAIL KING CANELO, VIVA MEXICO’S FIRST UNDISPUTED CHAMPION”!!!   Man I’m gonna miss Showtime Boxing, Mauro Ranallo is the best commentator in sports.
😂😂😅😂. Bully got his ass whooped. Lmfao.
Canelo is the greatest mexican fighter ❤🇲🇽🔥
So fake . Pay day……
Fake ass KO. Fight Benavides prove everyone wrong.
Goat Canelo
told him he was gonna feel something different 😅 not on his level 🦅🇲🇽
Respect to Plant...charla ain't no lion .. he a Bunny 🐰. . And benavides don't have a chance! With the cherry 🍒 picker canelo.
jumping left hook!!!!
That upper cut was brutal
Im not a fan of him but im glad canelo planted plant💪🏿
Canelo fucked up Caleb Plant lol
A 5'8" who started his pro career at 142 is bullying 6'+ guys who always been at 168 🤣🤣🤣   Canelo is in his own level
Took out Plant like a pesticide
What a nasty upper cut right after that vicious left hook. How plant didn't get knocked out by it I do not know. Man got a chin for sure.
Fake shit  Clearly you can  see plant wasn’t even trying and took a dive bro wtf is this  Feels like I’m watching wcw wwf ecw 🤦🏼
He Got PLANTed just like his Daughter LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
all I have to do is show this to someone to let em at least have an idea of how amazing canelo is, to really take it in even more Caleb plant is one of the best boxers in the sport like arguably top 5 on charlottes and Errol Spence level, but look how easy it was for this beast of a human
I just noticed Pland did the Joe Frazier skip at :29 😂
Had him running away like a coward😂😂
charlo coming back to this vid to cheer up 😂
Lol
Camarada Canelo Demostro Lo Que Se Ablo … Puro Respeto para Canelo… Planta Callo Al Suelo Como Debe De Ser… Ala Chingada …
Canelo Alvarez is one of the greats. No doubt about it.
Plant got knocked the f¥Clm out 🤣😂😂🤣
Never want to see a guy get hurt, but honestly Plant is a dirtbag. Slapping Canelo, pulling that burying move after knocking a guy out, and then hitting Charlo?  At what point is a guy just low class?
This is where the undisputed era began. After this everyone wanted to be undisputed.
Lmao ppl blame CANELO for fight all those Europeans and white boys there were the ones with the belts so of course he needed to fight all of them to take them
Damn, that had to be a high adrenaline type moment for Plant. At 0:22, you're hurt and wobbly and you see Canelo charging towards you at full speed like a Bull charges his target. That's gotta be a scary situation. Holy cow!
Canello knew he was weak and ran up on him like a pittbull
Idk why but I like when this referee appears
King Canelo
Couldn’t do that to GGG though. Had to pay off a judge instead.
Benavides beats plant by decision, canelo puts plant to sleep I wonder who would Win against each other lol canelo let’s go !!!!
Nice dive Plant. Get your money however you can I guess.  🙄
Plant definitely needed Kenny Baylees on this one  to finish the fight on his feet
😂😂😂
Here after the Caleb vs benavidez. Canelo got more power, chin, defense, IQ, then bena. Bena barking up the wrong tree damn
Benavidez up next for Canelo….
Here after David vs plant lol nelos beats David
So CANELO punch harder then Benavides
I’m sorry but if David plan against canelo is to fire him out he’s gonna get beat bad canelo has that dog in him Caleb doesn’t
Ref should’ve stopped it sooner
Background music fucking fire!
Why they call it ? At least count him out , if he gets up and you feel like he’s not all there then call it ? Boxing has gotten soft
James toney warned him exactly about this same situation and he was on his phone and instead of listening and soaking knowledge he encountered what he was warned about
@ 0:19  Mike standing up looking high af just watchin the fight like: 🙄😯😦👀
Running like the chicken he is, Ben gonna crack you
Jajaja los "golpes" que derribaron a Kaleb jajaja mas falsos que las caricias de mi EX
Para retar a un Campeón Mundial se necesita traer buen récord, haber enfrentado boxeadores de muy buen nivel y dar el peso requerido para poder enfrentarlo en su categoría... * Y para enfrentar al Canelo solamente piden que de el peso requerido y éso es todo. Así que ya saben, si dan el peso podrían tener una oportunidad, no importa si alguna vez han boxeado  o no.
Jajajaja así o mas falso el combate?? Por ése tipo de peleas arregladas se extraña a Carlos Zárate, Salvador Sánchez, JC Chávez!
Y'all ever feel like fighters get up too fast to show the crowd they're not that hurt ? I seen my friend take a knee after getting knocked down. Is pride really the reason fighters won't take some extra time to recover? Or do they not allow it
Damn y’all sucking Canelo so hard in the comments. Got the whole thing in your mouths, just the sack hanging out at this point 🤣🤣🤣 Bivol is a true boxer with out PEDs
Plant should’ve taken his time getting up, idk if that would’ve changed anything but it would’ve helped a little bit at least, it’s still a knock down whether you take your time or not so why not take the time
You should fight a true boxer wannabe King Canelo 😂, Arthur Beterbiev
But can he beat goku?
Best mauros comentating ever ,i love is wwe work too,canelo did it viva mexico carbones
0:28 bruh the ref was hyped af
A welterweight beating down a middleweight
I get the chills watching this moment just wow
People who are calling Plant a bum just to discredit canelos undisputed path, are about to see plant ain't no bum when he fights benavidez, it's just that canelo is so superior to everyone else at 168.
Damn! Just noticed plant didn't throw a single punch after he got hit with that nasty left hook. It was all survival after that, but canelo is an excellent finisher, there was no surviving that!...
So fake rigged and scripted and plant pretending to be punch drunk looking all goofy from a so called knockout punch with no real power behind it that barely tapped him lmao Plant got a nice hefty check for taking that swan dive lmao
Plant talked trash and there he goes 😂
Abraham Lincoln got his ass beat
So don't show us no videos of Caleb plant knocking nobody out cuz his ass went down too
Is canelo a white guy born in Mexico or something?
Crazy uppercut?
Plant took those shots pretty damn well for how clean they were. Props
And Jake paul wants to fight this man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
15 of 110 jabs is terrible
Canelo bringing it home for Ireland 🇮🇪
You wana fight?  “Yea” gives a mean look like hes about that.   Not even 7 seconds later runs and turns his back 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Should’ve let him get up. Like seeing Canelo batter that loud mouth
Plant tried to run home after he got up 😅
Seeing (plant) last fight , vs Dirrell and everything prior to Canelo he was a dawg . Lets ya see how good canelo really is ‼️😳
Love carnelo
Whooped his azz
Canelo running looked like a lion hunting down an injured gazelle
Fuk what anyone says… he is one of the greatest!!!
He has had issues with hand after this fight
Canelo shoved his trash talk right up his arse...  Got a feeling he won't ever be pulling that BS again... 🤣
If I was plan I would have asked the ref what he thinks about me fighting a little more just to kill some time!😂😂
Not hating, but I hope this wasn't Canelo's pinnacle because he is still relatively young...
all hail GOD‼✝✝✝
The Thanos of the middleweight championship
The biggest dive I ever seen
Plant don't get dropped
It was staged
That fight was thrown
Plant can hit very hard, hard enough to take Canelo or anybody else down. Canelo knew this and kept away from him until he tired. Plant is very powerful but compared to Canelo, he is very slow and cumbersome.
"The coronation is complete! All hail king canelo"... gives me chills every time
The judge should not have let him continue. Clearly.
Plant holding himself up with his gloves after the first knockdown like he about to start doing pushups lmao
Seeing the determination in Canelos eyes as he went for the kill on Plant to claim undisputed... NOTHING was stopping him the moment he smelled blood. Legendary stuff right here.
WTF is a caleb plant? Is that like an industry plant?
Caleb gotta live with Mike tyson witnessing this k.o. lol
Was this before or after Bivol ?
👍🏽
Plants not a total cupcake but close 😂
after watching this fight again idgaf canelo is beating GGG
The way mike tysos son was so hyped about the KO tells me he had a big bet on a canelo KO 😂
And THAT is why you don't go talking shit about somebody's mother🤣🤣
Wow!!!!!!  Incredible
Canelo is a healthy dude solid
Caleb is just not on there level. Take the money and run caleb.
The left hook should be in the title but still good stuff
Bivol stopped all this
Niccce
The canelo that fought daniel jacobs would've won against bivol. Something isn't right with canelo today
All hail king Canelo really Bivol gave him a boxing lesson
If only this happened last night with Bivol aswell😔I’m so sad he lost
I like when canelo starts running at him
gazelle punch
He did t ko him, he hasn't had a legitimate knockout since Kirkland at 154
In less than a year Canelo conquered
All hell juiced up canelo, if you remember when he fought Floyd that man was not this big I mean but then when the needles your trainer anything's possible
Anytime you test positive for a band substance that enhances your performance and muscle mass you will never be a true champion never because you did not get there on your own blood sweat and tears you added a needle to the equation
All hail canelo
Fake scripted fight
I wish canelo fights would be thru Showtime because of the buildup episodes towards the fights
When the fight ended canelo was going to wear another shirt instead os the wbc one but he said that would be disrespectful to plant I wonder what it was
Oh boy! Plant was running away from eminent doom. Man the way Canelo chased Plant after that uppercut only Mexicans can really translate it to the T, let me translate "come here puto...you wanted me here I am." I bet plant will think twice about opening his big mouth next time. Arriva Canelo!
😂😆😆😆 Tyson must have been mad af
0:44 dont really know who he is but he had the face of the GTF  down from there
🇲🇽🥊 🥊♥️
Idk
Song?
What song plays when he wins???😭😭😭
Everyone on here Hating the 🇲🇽 👑  and 🌎 Champion saying Mayweathet is Greater if your bringing him in outta nowhere Mike Tyson said himself “Mayweather is no Where near as Great or as Good as Juliar Caesar Chaves “🇲🇽 👑
Anyone notice canelo coach smack him in the neck 0:44
Feels so surreal to see Canelo on showtime. I wish he would stay on showtime forever. He belongs on showtime not dazn.
I love the way the crowd started singing along to Way 2 Sexy after Canelo won. The energy must've been crazy!
Wards bum axss would of got his axss whooped if he didn’t retire by canelo
💪🏼🇲🇽
I have a Mexican family so much of us about 50 of us were watching it in one room and the crowd was going so crazy
Damn he fell like a sack of beans
white boyK
That is some truly amazing talent!
Canelo collected all belts like infinity stones😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
*waddup waddup*
Caleb ran away scared
"Plant goes down! For the first time in his career!" Love it!
Ah inche musiquita
Ran at him like a bulll Matador !
KINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG  CANELO 1st Undisputed MEXICAN champion! WOW .... has mayweather ever been undisputed?
:22 Tyson knew it was over
Awesome 👍👍👍👍
That was the absolute best finish by Alvarez he just grew another tree with that plant 🪴
2:01 Andy Ruiz Jr. spotted
Andy Ruiz was the only person with no reaction when plant got knocked out 😂😂
Aye props to plant he did good but unfortunately his opponent was Canelo 🇲🇽
Carnelo vs Mayweather 2 carnelo by tko
I'll beat canelo for free lol
I may not be Mexican but I was Mexican that night ..
Long live the king! 👑
when canelo beats benavidez or charlo i wonder what the haters will bring up then
Gay canelo
lol andy ruiz in the backround jealous af
Plant looked like a rag doll . A lil boy vs a lion dude got smacked into reality plant you ain’t no killer  😂😆🤣
Andy ruiz is a canelo hater. Didn't celebrate the win.
Caleb plant is a joke he should retired, he talked too much shit and didn't show shit, he did it for the money , he is a disgrace for Boxing
All hail the GOAT 🐐
🔥
The way Mike Tyson got up and stood up to witness stuff that in his era was common.. This goes to show the kind of fighter Canelo is.
The most fun you can have watching boxing is seeing a loudmouth like plant get his ass beat by a much MUCH better man.  Plant is now a minor memory.
Fight mayweather. Part 2 come on
☺️🙂🇲🇽🇺🇸🇨🇦 mexico ,usa, Canada, stand together
Mauro is one hell of a commentator
Who knows the name of the song being played after the fight was over?
First I thought he said "all hell came with canelo"
Plant did so well, he got caught with that left hook. Other than that, he fought well
Mire bien canelo no le da jajajja y eso puño de bebe jajajja
0:26 when abuelita be coming at you with the cinturon.
Plant got his country ass PLanted. yehaww.
Do it to benavidez, charlo, and andrade
Thank you canelo. You saved us ALL. It's safe to say at least 80% of the bets were on the KO 😅
Canelo🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Canelo: at the end of the day we humans. Plant all dazed: I know you are but what am I.
I would never be able to be a boxer. I'm too evil. If I had a chance I'd punch opponents in the back of the head all the time. I'd like to end careers not win fights.
All the Americans before the fight: ALL MY MONEY IS ON PLANT!  Everyone else: Okay.
Hahahaha Caleb Plant was running from Canelo!!! Plant: No, I'm so sorry Mr. Canelo, I didn't really mean to call you motherfucker!!! Nooooo!!! I'mmmmm sorryyyy can you forgive please???!!! Canelo: Okay, okay, but first I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!!! Viva Mexico cabrones!!! Cheers
As a Canelo hater, he should have knocked him out earlier, and as a mexican im very proud of him
It's crazy how canelo knows what the opponent is going to do. Is how he landed that upper. True master
You can’t deny the fact that Canelo is one of the greatest boxers to ever step in the ring.  Look at what this guy has been doing! His last dozen wins are better than a lot of great boxers entire resumes!
I get chills every time I see this! Can yall imagine how Alvarez felt!?? Fuck!
My question is why they never came out with highlights of the fight.
Canelo Beat The Brakes Off That Boy! 😂😂💯
He did not KO him with the uppercut get the title right
I want the Charlo brothers to get some too.
That what happens when u dont know english
Rather you like Canelo or Hate him. Appreciate this man while we have him. Moments like these will be looked back as absolute gems and he’s gonna leave a MASSIVE void in the Sport once he retires
Best Mexican champion in HISTORY BY FAR. THE QUESTION IS NOT IS HE BEST MEXICAN BOXER OF ALL TIME THE QUESTION IS WILL HE BE THE GREATEST EVER IN HISTORY.  SURPASSED MAYWEATHER JR IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ONLY 31 yrs old
Other guy was a clown
Another great boxer Joe Louis said you can run but you can't hide Canelo says you can run but my fists will find you 😂😂😂😂 RIP Joe Louis
All hail 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Should have let plant keep fighting like he wanted to. He was obviously done, but just to clarify even more to Plant that he lost 💯
Lol if Canelo faught Jealousweather atm😂🤧🥊Canelohaters:Canelo beat up a old man 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️💀
Canelo vs Alvarez
Left hook more like it.
Plant did well to last so long, honestly though he was gonna be taken ouy in 5 rounds!!
Viva Mexico Culeros
Caleb, that jab didn't work well when you were on the floor. lololol
Hey Plant, did ya feel that somethin special Canelo said he'd give ya, lmao
no respect for Caleb, he CAN"T back up his big mouth. What was that you said Caleb, you will win? 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10!  Where are you Caleb, they didn't raise YOUR hand, but your lips were stopped, amen!
Never been knocked down in his career...he just did by a champ.
Canelo love bums
I think one of the things that makes Canelo so great that he’s showed these last 2 fights are the adjustments he made during the fight. Both his last 2 fights were a lot closer then the Canelo fan boys will admit. Not saying he was losing so don’t get ur panties in a bunch. Ole Billy Joe and Caleb fought a lot better then most people thought they would. But like I said one of the many things that make Canelo one of the best to ever do it was the way he can adjust. Once he figures you out it’s over.
How much money could’ve I won if I called a 11th round ko Ima start trusting my gut and I did trust my gut I just didn’t get:/
What a great time to be alive :)
Worst feeling for a man to go down in his first time in his career. It’s scary really and you get shocked. Plant had a good game plan until he started to get tired in the 10th. Canelo knew it was time. I give respect for Plant. He’ll come back and be a Champ once again. Saludos a el hijo de Guadalajara, Jalisco Caneelllooooo “Saúl” Alvarezzzzzzz!!!!
jakie next
I think after getting a hard lesson from the G.O.A.T Light Middleweight. He him self became the best student that ever cross path the GOAT
He never had a chance anyway
It's crazy how in the background. Mike Tysons standing there looking like a god wow
Caleb studied Mayweather and Canelo’s fight
That's why the dude is loved in his country! Of course haters their too! Like anybody But in the US ! And all over the world! Loved! Humble dude! And doesn't talk shit about anybody! But good or bad! Everyone has something to say about him! Face of boxing!
But he didn’t KO him with an uppercut….he KO’d him with the straight right. The uppercut knocked him down….but he got back up from that.
Canelo has only said “I can’t” once in his life. When he was trying to hold all the belts
The goat 🐐
The goat 🐐
Still waiting for official highlights
KING CANELO THE UNDISPUTED MEXICAN CHAMPION OF THE WORLD🙏🙏🙏❤️
Fully convinced canelo beats mayweather if he’s in his prime.
Ref: “you want to fight” Caleb: “yeah” Ref: “ok”  *caleb not throwing a single punch determines that’s was a lie  Good thing ref didn’t end the fight on first knock out
The Sledgehammer strikes again!   They thought Plant had a chance.  I didn't.   Canelo don't play.
Easy Day at the office for Canelo. There are levels to this game and Plant is somewhere in the middle .
Poor Lil Caleb the Tiny Plant he talked alot of smack in the buildup to this ass whooping.
He’s not “mexicos first undisputed champion” Julio César Chaves original undisputed champion
Did anyone else see Andy Ruiz in the crowd ?😂😂
LIKE A MATADOR GOING AFTER THE BULL FOR A KILLing
Canelo Canelo Canelo steroids steroids steroids
The man canelo ran at him like he was trying to give him a whooping 😂
On with Canelo but I don’t think that fight should’ve been stopped
Will go down as 4rd greatest boxer behind Ali, Tyson, Mayweather and him
@everyone bringing up Floyd. The loss with Todorov just shows you that you could never compare. It’s just about where you are in your fighting career. It’s a stupid argument.
Who’s the mother f***er!
wow the way Canelo pushed him off to setup the distance for the uppercut, brutal.  Great fight by Plant though......
This is what happens when you say something about his mother.
Is the full fight ever gonna get posted?
holly sjot
& everyone takes off their masks
0:22 Floyd runs away from you, Canelo runs towards you😂
Fixed
Canelo in training to master ultra Instinct...😇🙏🙏🙏🇲🇽 🇺🇸
Caleb running like Forest Gump after the first knock down,& then the little hop after the second one.......had me laughing hard!😁.
The way he pushed Plant back to create distance for that perfect uppercut was stellar! Canelo is the real deal.
This what canelo would do to mayweather if they fight but never gonna happen
For those looking what song iz that at 1:34 it's pepas by farruko
Santa Cruz and his dad are some fucking haters lol look at their reaction in the audience .    Talking about they are team plant because plant fights for PBC lmaoooooo what kinda shit is that
Canelo saw Mike Tyson watching and he did his signature roll under and left hook… That’s why Mike left with such a big smile on his face.
KING OF STEROIDS
All these shit talkers get smashed down everytime. HIS OPPONENTS NEVER RECOVER.
Less than a year WTF
Mike tyson in amazement lol
Floyd keeps proving why hes the goat. Canelo got his game from that fight
Caleb survived 102 power shots. He has my respect. I weigh 215 and no way I would handle just 1.
"I'm coming my friend"  That's when you know he's not your friend 😂
My favorite boxer next to Tank 💯 🥊
Plant all that shit talking n got KTFO
Canelo 🇲🇽🤴🇲🇽
Jake will destroy this fraud
Ruiz in the background just smiling haha
When trash talking goes wrong. .....again.  when will they learn!
It wasn’t floyd
Funniest nockdown seen,the guy was running and nowhere to run,canelo kicked he's ass,lol
Jake is stressing out he scared of canelo waiting for him to get old he don’t want that smoke! He would destroy him
Canelo aka undisputed Mexican Tyson Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
That walk/ run /jog thing Canelo does at 0:26got me dead as hell 😂😂🤣🤣
Combinations Caleb.
Plant, tank, García, wilder, Hayne, among many others are all paper champions!! Floyd ,Canelo, Pacquiao,Usyk, Taylor and a few others are real champs!!!
only because mayweather retired
mauro killed this call 🔥
168 is full of ducks because benavidez is the true champ. duck duck nation come get some smoke from benny!!!
Plant - my winter plans Canelo - the Omicron variant
0:26 love how Canelo ran😂
Caleb plant talks and acts like he’s another person . 🤦‍♂️ so embarrassing 🙈
Anyone know the song that was playing at 2:25?
0:21 kill mode activated
what's the name of the song playing at 2:32?
I’ve been following Canelo since he was a prospect back when he was knocking guys out in the 1st and 2nd rounds and I’m PROUD that I was right about him because the first time I saw him fight I remember thinking, this kid is going to be something special one day!!!
All real boxing fans, promoters, trainers  and investors, etc. knew Andre Ward would've have destroyed Canelo skill wise had they ever fought.  Andre, knew they would never let that take place,  that's why he took the bag and became a boxing analyst.  The boxing authorities are merely capitalizing off of the "Mexican Mania" and the tenant money grab by not matching Canelo up with a real top rank fighter like Andre Ward.  I'm African American and a HUGE Canelo Alvarez fan, but I know boxing and I  know business. Ride the wave of success until the wheels fall off.  Please don't text me any of your racist BS related comments.  Get out of your feelings and use your brain and see it for what it is really is - MONEY, MONEY and more MONEY.  PERIOD POINT BLANK..
Canelo doing that funny run towards plant is pretty scary
Great commentary by al Bertstein
Ref: come here, you wanna fight???  Plant: yeah...........  Ref: You sure!?????? You know he about to KNOCK YOU OUT RIGHT???   Plant: I don't wanna look like a bitch...........  Ref: okk... adios amigo.
I come back to this video once in a while just to hear that crowd roar.
Canelo your awesome!
Everybody knew canelos on a different level! Thinking this vanilla ice plant could bet him he beat himself stepping in the ring
Weak ass fight
He got Irish in his blood that's why he have red hair so mexican and Irish is fighting blood
Respect to plant . Has heart and is a hell of a fighter. But Canelo is King
Awesome clip, the best one yet!!
Tumba lo la vedga
Oh shit It was that right upper cut that got plant! 😳
Plant is a joke
That fool Caleb looked like Woody from Toy Story 💀
That silence from the broadcast crew right before the knock out was perfect. The action spoke all for itself. Great job
✊🏼 real TBE! Fax!
i would love to see a “ exhibition match “ of canelo vs mayweather right now
Viva Mexico man well deserved
Bin bang 😂😂
Defiately Canelo the goat of all times. fyi I born yesterday
All hail king canelo!!! Viva mexicos first undisputed champion!!! U guys see when one of his trainers put him up on hos shoulders Canelo took da biggest shot of da night low blow 🤣🤣 see him move the trainers head for fix his nuts getting smashed 🤣🤣
I love this fucking guy after that floyd lesson he probably the type of guy to say never again and actually put in the work to make sure he out it all on the line from the. On
Canelo casually knocking out men that are genetically bigger and taller than him.
Cringy strange ppl claim Canelo isnt Mexian 😂😂
0:28 When your mom starts running towards you to whoop your ass with the belt
What song is playing at 1:57?
Here after Caleb Plant said canelo has no power 🤡🤡🤡
Benavides vs Canelo
THE TERMINATION BEEN COMPLETE ALL HAIL KING CANELO 👑 - that shìt forever gives me chills
Canelo 1 perdió cinturón por miedo 2 empate dudoso 3 robó de pelea  4 la novela sigue
you can literally see ruiz just chillin in the background
Canelo going to another universe to collect more stones. Accomplishing way more than thanos.
Anyone knows the song @ 2:30?
Plant had to legit do something to Canelo behind the scenes to piss him off. I had never seen him take a fight so personal he is usually focused on doing good boxing but for this fight he really wanted to put him down.
The way Canelo ran after Plant was like my dad chasing me as a kid to beat my ass for letting the frijoles burn!
Siempre lo dije..Literal ..que lo iva hacer pagar....lo Bocón!! Canelo no tiene Rival ..en este momento ...en La Fas de la tierra...si ..hoy ..hey..que lo ke ..🥊🥊🥊👍🏻🌛🕺🏼
Hardest part of being a ref has to be letting a tornado go against a stunned opponent lol.
He ran towards him and punched him like  “ didn’t I fucken tell you not to touch my fucken thermostat “
@1:24 canelos foot stepped on Caleb's toes but he put his foot to the side so he can fully plant his feet before the punch!!! Master of his art🤌
What's the song being played between the commentary? Please
Caleb Plant was running scared after that 1 KD... Cheers
Wow, crazy uppercut. It came from the same place all uppercuts do; from underneath. Ffs with this sensationalism.
Man that was a crazy night being there. An unforgettable experience for sure
I’ll say it now if canelo waited to fight mayweather for a few more years he would be undefeated besides the one tie with GGG
Todos los que somos boxeadores sabemos que esto está arreglado ese golpe no trae fuerza esto es un circo
Came back to watch it again
quit holding saul's nuts must have forgot floyd whooped this fool out
Canelo is just too good!!
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
We are so tired  of this caca in mexico .
This was going to be an easy fight anyway……. Can anyone say TUNE UP FIGHT…. Lolol he act like he’s done something…..
any of you guys know the song they used after he knocks him down?
Canelo killed Caleb's body the whole fight paid off in the 11th
Plant didn’t believe in himself he could’ve won that fight if he did
Thats a real beat down.
Once Plant wobbled into the corner after Canelo dropped him you knew it was check mate.
Ref was scared for him he said “ you wanna fight?” 😂👏🏻
Canelo is great and I hope we enjoy his time in boxing while he is here. Let’s get that next fight locked in Champ!
Someone pleasseeeee tell me the song in the background that starts at 1:05
Que Viva El canelo Alvarez
This was satisfying to watch 🙌🏽🤣🤣 that’s what he gets for talking all that shit lol
What's the victory song called?
If Caleb wouldn't have talked about his mom, canelo maybe would of let him finish the fight to the 12. But canelo was like "heck no buddy, you gotta pay for that"
Fun Fact : Canelo has Irish  ☘️ ancestry  .
White boy actin hard lol.. thsts right baby
Viva La Raza 👏 Como diría Eddie.
Lucky KO! Plant did better than most thought!!
Respect to plant tho
I'm just curious I had someone tell me that they thought plant took a dive ? Lol now I don't believe that at all but I'm 100% sure this guy is and has been looking for a race thing ?  My question is dose anyone else think Plant took a dive ?  My opinion is Canelo smashed Plant perfectly
Bro canelo went for the kill after the first one
Andre ward and top rank 😭😭😭😭 no it can't be!!!
That boy plant almost got turned into a vegetable.
God have mercy on u through Christ
All heil King Thanos Canelo Alvarez 😤
Andy ruiz didn't celebrate the knockdown or the KO....... was probably going for caleb..
For sure when eddy slapped canelos head homie thought “ASI CABRON!”😂😂🔥🔥
I keep watching it over again just cause the way he finished him. The way he ran and gave his ass that right hook was mean lol.
He literally got planted
Just another stepping stone
Look at all them haters viewing this 😂
Canelo is P4P king!!
Fixed plant took a fall
Wasn’t the guy shouting the commentator who used to work for nxt?
I watch fight again Caleb was just tapping him.
Anybody know the song they were playing after the fight?
Thats a great ref
0:20 iron mike
Would love to see a rematch of canelo vs Floyd .but they won't do it cus they know Floyd would get beat now lol
Canelo NO  pasará a la Historia como el quiere  por que  estâ esquivano  pelear con los  mejores...eso  todos  lo sabemos
This was a great fight, both fighters did well.  Caleb deserves respect for his holding his own and even coming out on top at times.  Canelo's efficient fighting allowed him to land power hits when needed and he maintained his massive power by the end of the fight.  A fantastic fight by both.
Props to Plant for not going down again at 0:27, Canelo catches his chin with a nasty right hook as he's got half his body turned away. He was out on his feet but still stood up until the last flurry seconds later.
Odalay Canelo
How much did mike Tyson loose  cause it seem to me that he was good for plant
Viva Mexico
Idc mauro ranallo is a legendary commentator !
Canelo running towards Plant is simultaneously the funniest and scariest thing in the world
King Canelo Alvarez!
Thanos who flat-footed canelo lol
Mudilo steroidnoe vash Cream Caneloni
Canelo is like get over here u bitch I’m not done with you
What song is played after the win? Straight up 🔥
Pure goosebumps. After the first knockdown, no commentary. You just hear the crowd screaming and the sounds of Canelo finishing Plant. What a moment for Canelo.
Why is he fighting someone with 3 fights just an embarrassment
Is it possible to see Crawford Alverez fight???
Un producto de Univisión y televisa. Es más marketing que boxeo  ..cesar chavez ese si era boxeador y puro madera pero canelo esta muy lejos de eso
King Canelo 🇲🇽 💪🏽
Canelo running after him,  NOT COOL
PEEKABANG!!!!!
What’s the Spanish song that played when canelo won
El jefe cabron el jefe el mejor viva mexico
Canelos last tuff fight was ggg ever since then he's been scared to take on tuff fights fighting pro amateur fighters don't make u great
Jordan plant should of been in the corner that night 🥴🥴🥴
Canelo Era
Canelo's conditioning is super human.
Gracias canelo
He is the most cerebral fighter ever GOAT
Good for gingers everywhere
🤣🤣😂😂😂😆😆🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Eyy don’t talk about his fucking mom.
He makes gingers everywhere proud
Just have one question, who did the chicken dance? From what I saw Caleb did an awesome chicken dance.  Where is all the talk and confidant now. Don’t trust Caleb’s guarantee because They didn’t say and the née unified world super middle weight champion and still undefeated.
Imagine talking all this shii and still loosing
Dana white bet a hundred thousand on Canelo 💯
Plant would’ve win its like they give him some millions to slow down.
jake paul: i want canelo  😂😂😂
canelo is the goat
The irony .. mexicans always plant
I'm still looking for the uppercut that knocked Plant out.
Venevidez vs Munguia 2022
Sorry to say but that looked like a DIVE
Beef or pork🤔🤔🤔
Canelo was giving a clinic but I think Plant was definitely going to beat the count. Maybe one more chance to get through the round? I don’t think he was going to knock Canelo out or anything at any point but still it only take one shot. Anyone else think it was stopped to quick?
Mayweather.🤔🤔🥺🥺
Good I don't like posers like plant. Talking like he's from the hood.
I know this is offensive, but it looks like a boxing SpongeBob SquarePants.
Dose anyone think the ref called it to quickly?
BoxingEgo and his 1k subs dislike this video! 🤣😂
🎶 The whole crowd roar so loud 🎶
We are Proud of Canelo 🎉🇲🇽
The way Canelo pounced reminded me of how George Forman chased and demolished Joe Frazier in their first fight.  Dude was NOT playing games!
Anybodu know the name of the song playing
que gran actuacion de estos dos
The Way Canelo Ran Too Him after the first knockdown 😂, “ You Wanna Talk About My Mom” I Am The Belt. Take This Whoopin
I agree Canelo has earned his way to become the face of boxing
Lost to Lara, Maywether, and GGG twice, you canelo fans are deluded and it’s not even funny anymore
The ol Joe Frazier leaping hook..devastating
Lo hubieras  Dejado que se recuperará güey
We need a floyd canelo 2
He lost to mayweather amd tarnished his reputation could've been the goat but he couldn't win the big one, not impressed
Don't ever mess with a Mexican or you are fried.😜🤪😝
Kicked his assss!
Plant seemed cocky.
He made Chavez Sr so happy 😊
He busted that ass. Shit talking didn’t save him
Couldn't beat Mayweather tho
I get chills watching this over and over again..
Plant never gave up. Even after his knockdowns he immediately stood up trying to shake off the damage. Incredible. A tough son of a bitch but still no match for the king of boxing.
Rhats for talking shit . 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Canelo really sprinted to get to plant
This is crazy! He's the best boxer I've seen in years!
You can see that second hook rocked his spine!😳
Y por que la segunda caida lo le contaron todavia se podia levantar
Shawn porter vs canelo !!!! Let’s make it happen
Noooooo!!! He wasn't readdyyyy...
Boxing is such a corrupt sport lol shit was rigged. Plants acting like he was KO’d is silly as he stood back immediately on the second down. Boxing as whole is a sham lol they pay the other fighter to take the L for you blind that didn’t know this happens.
I can't believe anyone thought plant would win
Watch him vacate ANOTHER belt and run to another division when the best fighters want the smoke wouldn’t be surprised if he moves up just to avoid another mandatory
Canelo es un buen peleador pero pelea con lara de Nuevo todos queremos ver Esa pelea de Nuevo
Canelo ran towards him like an NPC 💀
Atmosphere was crazy loud
Es una bestia
boi got planted
Plant got ROBBED , of his ability to defend himself 😆
Andy Ruiz didnt even get up to applaud what a traitor
Plant actually did the chicken dance when he got hurt. Very questionable legs.
I truly wanted Plant to win. Saying that though, I heard what Saul Alvarez said after fight and now I want him to win  every fight here on til out my friends, me amigo's ✌️🤘
Canelo taking all the infinity Stones
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!! JALICO NE SE RAJA!🇲🇽
Praise almighty God !
That slap to the back of the head at  0:43 rocked him lol look at the way he got down
Sorry, Chavez Sr.
I’m happy for canelo.  He is the Mexican Mike Tyson 👍👍👍
Dammmmm!
Plant cant fight
The ref asked him if he wanted to continue fighting, and he says yes. Then he starts fleeing.
CANELO the WHITE BOY KILLER !!  European Caucasian SLAYER !  He picked the EASIEST ROAD TO UNDISPUTED EVER ! (Wait till BENEVIDEZ loss on the scale then GETS GIFTED THE PATH!  Is this your KING 👑 ?)
Take Benavides out now!...  he's not on ur level... comin from mx American
Okay wtf is the difference between showtime and showtime anytime
Stop doubting mike tysons judgement 💯
At 0:40 did canelo get slapped in the back of his head?
Brooo I want prime Canelo vs Mayweather badddd
Talk all that shit and get your ass knocked out 😆😆😆
Fight benevidas next.
I think canelo let him sorvive till 11 round, Caleb now know Canelo punch power..
I practicing boxing since long time , when punch like that hit your face , you will loss visibility,brain confusing and you out is can hard to recover in seconds, you have fall because you don’t want be reached for opponent , to sorvive and may come back nex after referee count…
What the song called after he won the fight
Maybe canelo mejor del la historia d boxes como el ruso n UFC 🤔
Does he have a skin and hair condition?
I wanna see Canelo V Maywhether
Again Plant could of won on points if he stuck to his boxing skills instead of trying to brawl inside with canelo. Very stupid decision. Canelo shouldn't give Plant a rematch cause I think Plant will stick to his strength which is his boxing skills and will beat Canelo on points.
Fix fight with bad acting for canelos opponent. Watch it again and I do mean... really watch it again! 😆
When the other "champion" does not even belong in the ring with you. Canelo is the GOAT.
The KING
you can seee mike Tyson in the maroon jacket just smiling in the background like "yeaaaaa dere ith isthhhhh" lol
I just want a top tier boxer to step in the octagon.
Puro chingon
Booo. Canelo couldn’t beat Money Mayweather and doesn’t have a perfect record. He will NEVER be the greatest.  Gypsy King is the greatest !!
This Canelo  was born to destroy any boxer is and his face ,  yeah baby let’s go “Canelo orgullo Mexicano”!!
Boy chaced him down hard fucking head hunted him.
The way eddy jumped in tho looking like he gouda scrap someone
Why he run like that @ 0:26 😂
1:05
VIVA MEHICO 🇲🇽
💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Fakenelo
Did I see that right Plant is running away?this dude looked like straight out of a murdur scene
Plant got knocked by a 5'6'' guy
This fight like the last three Canelo fights was joke. Quit feeding Canelo these paper champ white boys so he can look good and bring in a real contender. Canelo isn’t the king. How can you be the king of boxing and you’re a juicer(steroids)! Money May all day chump!
0:26 cuando me bajo del carro ya casi cagandome y corro al baño 🤪🤪
Damn it looks like half of Mexico is out there in that crowd and I see one white person mike Tyson was there it was a couple black people that was about it
If Caleb Plant could move "right" at all, he could have won this fight.  The only time he did was assisted by an Alvarez left hook!  Not a good matchup.  Alvarez does everything in the ring.  Plant is good but one dimensional.  You beat Alvarez with unpredictability (ala Floyd Money Mayweather).  Stand in front of him and good night!!
king cinnamon lol
El paletero vale verga!
“all hail king canelo viva mexico!! first undisputed champion from Mexico!”  gives me the chills
Another win for Canelo
Canelos on him like a banty rooster
Canelo Made America Great Again!
So happy to see canelo back on PPV. Dazn was low balling. 35 million per fight is TOO low for the KING of boxing. Canelo vs Charlo will make over 100 million between the two.
There's no competition at middleweight. He's fighting average fighters.
What’s the Mexican song at the end when he won
Is almost a bit sad the guy is literally trying to run away for his life wishing the bell save him or something.
Yo me chingo con el canelo. Hechenmelo.  Jajaja 😜 también corriendo se gana.
Watching the results of the fight unfold as I had predicted days before the bout has me more godly than usual
Who said white boys cant fight lol
To see who is best is why they fight the fights.
This guy would literally eat Floyd Mayweather Jr for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  https://youtu.be/JxNGCrMuiTc👈💪☝
Plant talked all that shit and was literally skipping away from Canelo before the KO looking back as Canelo charged like a train ! 😂bjs give a better fight!
Have to say Canelo is a beast. One thing different from Floyd Jr is that Canelo is an exciting fighter to watch. He brings beat downs and KOs just how boxing enthusiasts love to see!
I guess that boy Plant wasnt really "LISTO PA LOS CHINGAZOS" huh? 😂😂😂
Canelo keeps fighting the best and andrade and charlo keep fighting Bums and still try to get In grown men conversations
Looked staged.
Canelo got tired of playing with his food ...
WANT TO MAKE THE BIGGEST FIGHT IN BOXING HISTORY?? THEN LETS HAVE A  CANELO VS MAYWEATHER REMATCH!!
CANELO DID AN AN AMAZING JOB. BUT I ALSO GIVE RESPECT AND SUPPORT TO TEAM CALEB PLANT. THIS IS ONLY GOING TO HELP HIM IN THE FUTRE.
Mayweather should fight Canelo again !!! I'd watch that.
King Canelo 👑
Someone should make a corrido of canelo !!
King Canelo 🇲🇽
All hail king canelo!
Caleb  , obtuvo  lo que andaba buscando , una buena madriza,  todo por unas cuantas mentadas de madre!
Mayweather give Canelo his rematch! Cmon Mayweather King Canelo deserves a rematch! He fought you when he was in his early 20's and is way better now then he was then. KING CANELO RULES SUPREME!!!
Who's next!?Benavides is an easy target,the bigger they are the harder they fall! Charlo?Canelo will destroy Charlo! Ward is too weak against Canelo. Canelo the greatest boxer in boxing history!!!
King Canelo rules Supreme!! All other boxers bow down!
Canelo is afraid to fight Mexican boxers why didn't he knocked out GGG or Mayweather? He couldn't buy them right
Mismatch fight!! Canelo is just too skillful and too fu**ing strong!!He has the highest IQ!!king Canelo rules Supreme! Every boxer is going to bow down to king Canelo!
What we need right now is another Filipino Mexecutioner to stop this guy
😠😱😣
Never seen someone w/ so many belts!
Looks like buddy shouldn’t have kept his yap flapping , now he got his destiny he deserves
Dude is just a beast
Not beating Gervonta davis
John 8:11  “She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.”
The pride of every mexican alive
I love it when the shit-talker gets ROCKED!!!
Beterbiev Arthur if he fought Canelo would beat the greatest Mexican boxer
His tongue chastised Plant. This always happen when someone bad mouth the opponent. Luke chapter 14:11; 18:14 . Many canelo's opponents had done the same thing and have been beat up by Canelo very badly. They need to read what the bible says will happen to people that are not humble themselves.
Yeah keep talking shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥canelo got the bitches making line
Canelo was about to feast on his ass Caleb plant good man much props seriously
Disgusting sport you either insult or get insulted
canelo is on another level
Shoulder roll don’t work lol
I'M A BIG TIME SAUL CANELO ALVAREZ FAN SO I'M JUST GLAD THAT HE BEAT THAT OTHER GUY FOR TALKING ALL THAT CRAP AT THE WEIGH IN THAT'S EXACTLY WHY CANELO PUSHED HIM THAT DAY AND THEN KNOCKED HIM OUT IN THE 11TH ROUND HE WAS LETTING HIM GET SOME BODY HITS ON HIM TO GET HIM TIRED TO BEAT HIM JUST  LIKE IN ALL OF THE OTHER FIGHTS FROM THE PAST SO I'M JUST PROUD OF SAUL CANELO ALVAREZ FOR BEATING HIM THAT NIGHT
Other Mayweather , easy money for gays , really sucks
Canelo still NOOOOOO COMPARISON to the GREATEST Mexican fighter ever Julio Caeser Chavez..I laugh at ALL you Canelo crank-biters! Everyone knows he didnt beat GGG, Straight up!
Was it just me or did the Saunders fight feel more electric than this one? this was still a great fight tho
Canelo needs to move up to 175 now
Who’s here after the Mexico lose to the U.S in soccer 😂😂
"Run for your life Charly Brown" that was some kind of weird way to escape 🤔😅😳  Canelo told him "You will see and feel something special"
thanalo alvarez came for those gems
Caleb is a fkn liar he said he was going to win
Even Floyd said it mexican boxers run the sport
What song is playing once he wins and they recap?
Down goes the plant
That shyt was weak 😂😂
Mike Tyson did say Plant was going to get ***** up.
Nos debería de dar verguenza que al Canelo le pongan pura basura para que gane y se creo chingon. Ponganle uno bueno para que vean como se la parten.. hay que ser realista.
So heartwarming to see the obnoxious Plant get flattened by the best fighter on the planet. Canelo should have helped Plant up and continue to wallop him.
I love canelo Alvarez I want him to get Floyd
Vendido
my only wish is pacquio would have faced Canelo
canelo making FLoyd look even more like a Legend
Wow that was violently  awesome👊💥👊💥👊💥👊💥👊💥👊
Puro bulto a los que se enfrenta el Canelo, nunca será como Julio Cesar Chavez y otros campeones de México.  Pura publicidad!
Just noticed he beat him down in front of his corner
WhAts the song playing in the background???
Canelo just keeps getting better. Its amazing to see a fighter who has been in the game for this long to still be improving. Mexico has always produced world class fighter's. Canelo is just another one added to the very long list.
Let him come up to the LHW division and see what he can do.😂
God damn. Last time I saw canelo he was getting destroyed by money mayweather.   He has come a long way that’s crazy I would have never imagined
Culitooooo
Caleb had 21 fights n 21 wins👎👎👎he was Set up by 🌎 world Boxing 🥊 Federation 👁👁to look like A Champion 👎They put him boxers who  took $$$$$$$. So they  could Losses 😱n Caleb came to Believe he was  A Real Fighter 😱he found out he was not—-all to benefit Boxing 🥊 Fans 😱for top Money 💰 🍶 sake👽
Mayweather sitting at home like 🤔
"listos pelos chingasos"
Canelo is the best
Caleb isn't worth a rematch....wasn't even close for all that talking 🙄
Where’s mayweather
No joke viva Mexican fighters chingon
Tiempo para retirarse. Desfruta
Great  fight tuf opponent.  No shame
Imagine the last moments you see is Canelo chasing you down 🥴🥴
U can't b talkin smack bout your opponent then get your a$$ whooped by said opponent.
i wish Floyd would step up and bring it. he could never beat this PRIME Canelo. NEVER!!!!!! so keep fighting those youtubers, Floyd. we all know you’re scared
Plant was making him miss all night. It was staged.... you can tell Canelo was gased and Plant mysterious stayed in front of him towards the end of the fight. $$$$$$$
Staged fight.
Talked all that shit..and then got knocked the fuck out!.😆
Jajajajajaja la pura farsa
Caleb probably saw his whole life review in those 2 seconds; when he was getting knocked down.
Imagine getting groomed and built up just to get knocked out by canelo.
No dought
OMG!!! leave Canelo alone. Just 168lb European fighters were Champs and 2 Americans now in 175lb European dominating that class and here comes Canelo maybe fight Smith Jr. Next or Benavidez maybe Chalo i said forget chalo make him wait for duckin other fighters if he want to support his family fight somebody!!!
Mexico's 1st Undisputed Champion Of The World CANELO ALVAREZ!!! 🏆🇲🇽 ☝
Judges outta be held accountable,looking at the stats how can you say plant was at 96?
That left hook before the uppercut was not normal, you have to be powerful to throw a punch like that that late in a fight, I have box three rounds and I was dead tired, could hardly lift my arms
Gervonta Davis
Good champion God bless you
Alot of Canelo haterz say Caleb 'Sweet Face' Plant did way better than what they expected and he still kissed the canvas TWICE but Canelo came out scratch free, not once hurt against Fragile Floyd and haterz say Canelo was murdered, killed, sluaghtered, beat, etc., etc......they need to make up their mind on what a real beat down looks like because Canelo just displayed that, so get off yalls knees already, it's been almost a decade since that Marathon took place
He need to verse mayweather again
nothing Nothing NOTHING Tougher than a Mexican! Viva Mexico! 🇲🇽
It looks like Canelo’s coach wobbled him with that slap to the back of the head!
I don’t care what anyone says, Canelo is better than Floyd hands down.
Bye, bye Plant thanks for showing up next it will be either Charlo or Jose benavidez and they both will get the same treatment beat down in the haters will continue to hate
He gone have a statue in Mexico if he doesn't already at the Capitol, I can see him doin what Manny did, BUUUUUT hehe that ain't the easiest place to be no president 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody cares about Canelo''s weak path to become undisputed 🖕🖕
Crowd was hype
Who is Caleb Plant?
Wow. Props to Canelo. He has come a long a way from those GGG fights. You earned it Canelo. Enjoy.
Ese era un pinche paquete
0:26 Canelo is running over to knock Plant out.
Isaacar in the the house
he did a JoE Frazier
Aye and Oscar was calling out Nelo at one point 😂
THANELO
I think plant is gonna have some insecurities after this fight 😂
Jake Paul is the only one that’ll give canelo problems
Q nocaut tan falso
Ref - You wanna fight? Ok ✅
GGG will kill him, shsss sigein
But but but….he didn’t hear maywedder!!!
That horse meat is unstoppable
……….ALL HAIL KING CANELO!!! 👑
I can’t get tired of watching this!!! 😬
Canelo prime>Gayweather prime
Some people talk to much and dont know when to 🤫 stfu
He almost got knocked out at 0:44
Wasn't the uppercut.. that was just icing on the cake. It was that vicious left hook
Plan no contrataca Canelo es buen boxeador pero asi con un contrincante como plan,no asé lusir lo que en verdad sabe
Plant has not beating any respectful fighter, why was he in the ring against Canelo?
Is this the same fool (plant) that talked sh** about Canelos mother? He lost the fight at that moment. Plant should clean  Canelos horse stables out for being disrespectful.
Canelo is a Great Champion. You see how he made space too land that uppercut. Great stuff
The reason Canelo has energy, is he pressuring  and while their on the defensive end ,trying to keep the pressure off, Canelo beats away at their body dropping their hands. Great Technical fighter ,experience does come in to play..
Just reminds me how good Floyd really is, he embarrassed Canelo smh..
Somewhere in the world there’s a man drunk and high out of his mind watching this fight from his couch.and as he leans over to do another line he sits back on his couch and pulls up on his fishnet stockings and he looks over to his 90%plastic girlfriend and he tells her “you know I used to promote canelo”
Canelo needs to fight a guy with big power these white guys from England and Caleb ain't it man.
Viva Mexićo 🇲🇽 🐐
🇲🇽
that goes with any fighter, if you get caught clean with a upper cut, it will send your legs ta hell, in matter of seconds
Lol i knew canelo was gonna kick his ass and there were alot ppl saying plant would win. Nope
King nelo doesn't throw hella punches that's true but when he does and he misses he doesn't mind tht either cause he's fig u out and eventually catches you
Bye bye plant 🤣🤣🤣🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Triple g is the best
0.25 playback speed , just above Caleb Plant's head as he is going down in the first KO Andy Ruiz has absolutely no reaction whatsoever , no blinks, no head movement , nothing ..
HahahhHahahhahaja stupid  ppl say canelo is the best hahahHhHH. Canelo is the best actor  in the ring
KING CANELO!
Don't talk about canelos mom🤣🤣
Canelo is lucky i never got into boxing or i would have kicked his ass.
Canelo is lucky hes fighting in an era of bums.
Hush!!! Canalo is king !!! You boxer can dance with him but you'll  never win!!!!!
Not anywhere on the same level
De donde sacaron ese bulto 😆😆calet plant is in other clown like Arnie yerdirin place in the 👎👎👎😜😜
Canelo is a beast
BRO, GAMBOA COULD BEAT CALEB PLANT💥🤛🏽 THIS FIGHT SHOWED HOW TRULY CALEB PLANT STINKS, BUT I KNEW HE STINK CUZ HE FOUGHT BUMS & HOMELESS OPPONENTS HIS WHOLE CAREER 💩💩
was that some of the  Ward training how to run away and bend over  im  not shocked   i said it before the fight happened  either Plant is going to find an excuse  before the fight  or he si going to box  run around and make it to the end or i said just hope Canelo does not catch up to him  but give him his just due  he lasted 11 rounds not bad he will be back  on top someday
The way Canelo runs towards Plant triggers my PTSD to when my mom would chase me to whoop me
Pelea arreglada
eso fue una payasada ni siquiere lo toco la primera vez
4:45 the hardest thing that hit canelo that night🤣🤣🤣🤣
He shoulda got a 10 count but great fight regardless
Por bocon
He wanted to be like Tyson a legend my friend you are a legend
I've been saying it before benevidez said it himself the ONLY fighter that can give canelo TROUBLE listen to what im saying TROUBLE maybe beat him is benevidez because of his size power in both hands and he also has speed in both doesn't rely on a right hand all night the only thing that benevidez lacks is defense if he could tune that up is probably the only good way or chance he has of beaten canelo.
Steroids allow the body to stay strong all the way through 12 rounds
The only person who can beat Canelo is Thanos with all 6 infinity stones
“ALL HAIL KING CANELO VIVA MEXICOS FIRST UNDISPUTED CHAMPION” commentator was on fire 🔥
When he’s looking at your body he’s really looking at your eye socket
All hail kingnelo
It's crazy. As he gets older, he gets better.
Lol and there is still some some mexican canelo haters that say canelo didnt him him he fell cuz he was paid to do so...he almos rip his head off lmao
Lol the way canelo was chasing plant before he knocced him out lol canelo is a beast
I'm sorry but UFC is just so much better. Boxing is dead 💀 😴
Early stoppage?
Squid Game Dreams Edition-https://youtu.be/3fGorSqEtNw
He's just as exciting to watch as Marvelous Marvin was . #greatest
😢  for plant, he looked so weak and out of place when he went down the fist time.. and his face is just sad to watch..
Yall see Andy Ruiz in the back? Lol
Pbc racism against Latinos don’t worry we takeover
Pbc hating on teofimo Lopez
Alvarez is a drug enhanced fighter ,as long as boxings ruling bodies continue to dishonorably look the other way he'll never be beaten..
I really am starting to like Canelo I’m a black man but I admire his Mexican pride  an his humble personality he’s really now starting to open up a lil more you can see it leading up to this fight he’s Truly One Of The Great Ones his name will be in there with Joe Louis,Ray Robinson,Floyd,Ali L,Tyson,Chavez an all the other greats an he’s barely 30 smh 🤦🏽 accomplished this much an only half way in his career still got like 10 or more years boys dangerous
Canelo in the contracts deshidrate the other boxers...is not fare...
Mexico is racist look at his skin. Everyone look at his skin
Jajaja plant wanted too run but canelo told him were aryou going barby?
ALL YOU BOXERS AROUND THE WORLD BOW DOWN,KNEEL AND "HAIL KING CANELO" LONG LIVE THE KING.. 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Money Mayweather
Not even Ward the so called the son of god couldn’t do that. Ward an overrated boxer
Damn I thought plant could actually win this one 😂
The D riding in this comment section is hilarious. Y'all wouldn't recognize a dive if you landed in a pool
You want to fight ?   Yeah lmao    Not Really ....
If only Canelo had connected the left punch on chicken Floyd. But Floyd used his shoulder to perfection.
Caleb Plant is a good fighter just needs to fight more and get better. They both gave us a good fight.
Beeeeeassssttttt 🇲🇽
Cuándo pelee con Danny García entonces si voy a considerar el canelo como un boxeador
I can beat Canelo … hold my beer
Its easy when your fighting tomato cans.
This Joint Fake and Rigged.
Same punch that ended Saunders orbital,  he pusbes the fighters all fight til he times the duck and hits uppercut , he's done it quite alot,  thr uppercut to the ducking dude,  ends up a.. A duck
Just imagine if Canelo was 6' with reach; scary great now!  Detractors like to point to his defeat to Mayweather, but ask yourself, "if a young  Mayweather of 23 would last against  present day Canelo or would have fought GGG at the latter's prime?"  Answer is, Mayweather would not have and never did fight Pacquiao at his prime nor uninjured and for sure, avoided GGG like the plague.   Mayweather never was a fighter that had guts to take on a dangerous fight unless the odds (age & experience) were in his favor.  Give Canelo credit for having taken that fight at that young age against a Mayweather at his prime.  Furthermore, Canelo lost but, he wasn't destroyed during that fight.    NO TKO, MUCH LESS a KO.  Add to that that Canelo fights often and fights fighters who are taller, bigger, with greater reach than Canelo and reigning champs in various weight categories.   And you have the greatness of Canelo!
Tyson was right this young star got some arms !
👑
bullshit!! canelo never landed those shots !! watch again but anyways i am mexican but also a box fan and this was fake he never touch him 😡😡 fake canelo this is just money!
ARRIBA MEXICO CABRONES ! TO ALL THEM HATERS. " NOW WHAT U GOTTA SAY" LMAO FACE OF BOXING LIKE IT OR NOT 🥊❤🔥
Modern day human thanos
Que paso plant 🌵 ahora sí aprendiste a cerrar tu gran boca trata de ser profesional pero sobre todo respetuoso y más cuando te enfrentes a un rival de la talla de canelo profesional y caballero entonces calladito te podrías ver mejor y tal vez empezar a respetarte primero tu y tu alrededor en la primera  fuiste agresivo verbalmente y te puso el ojo morado y en el ring mordiste la lona 👎
Canelo P4P Best Charlo your next Ma Dude
My guy walked his ass down!!!
I’m so tired of the lame thanos jokes! Marvel movies are for kids, grow up!!
He will never be as great as Money Mayweather!! TBE!!
Refere; u wanna continue fight?  Plant; yeah!!!!!   Not one pounch he trow after he said yeah, then he gets ntfo
What’s the song before drake song
What’s the song playing during the highlights!
And jake paul wants this dude ? Lmao really? He would abliterate ole jakie boy .
Canelo’s gonna need a bigger  crew just to hold his belts
No wonder why Mayweather wants to only fight the Paul brothers
Floyd gay weather you are next
Canelo ya entro en la historia… a huevo
Why would anybody dislike this lol
Eddy Estes grande le pegaste un zape al canelo lo bajaste de la nube ☁️ y te respeto eres un buen entrenador pero sobre todo un buen amigo ánimo
Canelo vs Floyd Mayweather I would love to see that
Can't wait to hear that guy from tiktoke southpaw boxing throw a fuckin tantrum 😂
No doubt Canelo is the best in this point in time. Is he 100% clean and natural? Probably  not,  but most fighters are not 100% clean. Canelo being positive for Clen shows he has or someone who gave it to him has knowledge in anabolic substances. Highly likely other substances are being utilized. But in this point in time many are utilizing any and everything to have a chance to be the best.
Canelo=💩
The first gringo Mexican undisputed champion of the world!!!!!!!! Hell yeah I always liked him. Good stuff! When I was explained there are actually white Mexicans I thought that was very intriguing. Mestizos
World 🌎!! Eat your heart out!! Don't mess with the paisanos!!! Or you'll get knocked the freak 🤪 😜 out!!
And yet....Mayweather made Canelo look like a rookie boxer.
Most dominant fighter in boxing history. With almost 40 knockouts on his career and 60 wins. This man keeps getting better and better. Adjusting and pure dominance🌎
For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have ever lasting life.John 3:16  Jesus died on the cross for your sins and rose again on the third day from the tomb. He wants to show you all that he can do to help change your life for the best if you put your trust in Jesus.He also gives eternal life for those who believe. He loves you.😀💛
This was a masterpiece by Canelo. Body shots and shots to the arms to wear down Plants defense. I love the fact that he gave him the round before to save up some energy for this masterful round ! Patience and sticking to the game plan worked out for Canelo 💪🏼 🥊 🤴 . Kudos to plant for lasting that long in the fight
Dont be fools! After the conversation on 9th round That was the signal caleb gave to canelo to fake a knock out, then right after that he put his guard down, just look carefully at the knock out, when caleb put his face down as well as his guard to receive a clean shot from canelo, after all caleb was only there for the money as all boxers canelo is been fighting lately, it was just another canelo show and all of his fans felt for it as always making him richer than he is now, so sad boxing nowadays has become a circus
That's some ol school Mike Tyson shit!
ese boxeador se vendió como parte del show de coronación de los quince de canelo
Whats the song playing after canelo knocks plant out?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💩
Puro  costal escoge
Bravo 👌canelo 👏👍💪
Sanders gave canelo a better fight then plant ..
Solo paquetes
Everybodys got a plan....until the get punched in the face.
All hail King Canelo! Deal with it haters...
🪴 loss me as a fan after that ninth round footage came out he’s a pretender
Nunca seras el mejor..
He did NOT KO him with the uppercut.  He knocked him down but not a KO! He pretty much KO'd him with the straight right.
0:23 Damn talk about being put on the ropes. He was hoping it would swallow him up and get him out of there asap.
All those people still wearing masks??? Lol...masks don't do anything..so gay
Canelo is the best right now he's and one of the best all time even though Mayweather Lara and ggg beat his ass
Only one person can beat canelo right now and he is retired.  Please ward come out of retirement and beat the cheater
Tough as nails
Let’s get jake paul in the sense he wants to run his mouth then he will know what it’s like fighting a real boxer
No mamen raza ya ni ganas de ver estas peleas más pinches falsas,,,el pendejo del canelo siempre le ponen peleadores que no sirven para nada,,ya se sabia que iba ganar,ojalá ya le pongan un uponente chingon para que se le quite lo osicon
That one mark on his record from Floyd has to feel like an itch he'll never be able to scratch.
Tank would smash Canelo
Puro show del Canelo, le sigue pegando a puro costal. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Wake us when he fights Charlo.
https://youtu.be/TGwWRAtWZXA
#CanelovsCharlo
So many belts he can't carry them all.
Glad to finally watch this in HD
Again canelo's fight is false, all the canelo's fights are falses.
Esa pelea es fraude que lastima que se caleb se aya vendido por dinero
Com on, let’s get that Jake in there to literally destroy his ego for once. Let’s do it Canelo. Just as a life lesson to an egotistical maniac! And you can give all the money to a charity in Mexico!
Viva Mexico Canelo
Would have LOVED to see Canelo go against other legendary Mexican fighters like Chavez, Morales, Barrera, Marquez
Jesus loves you 😇
Haters: Canelo cheats (no proof whatsoever)  Reality: Canelo consistently comes out clean in his tests
WE'RE LIVING IN A HISTORIC ERA OF BOXING, CANELO'S FIGHTING CHAMPION AFTER CHAMPION AFTER CHAMPION, MAKING HISTORY!
Now it's going to be a tough road ahead.     For anybody challenging Canelo. Lol
Canelo made a lot of people proud!💪
He never beat GGG.  This is all a farce.
Andre Ward
Where is the count man?
You know the haters be like: "Canelo still gotta beat, Boo Boo, Charlo, Benavidez, Fury, Wilder, Thanos, The Lions from Seigfired & Roy, and GOD to earn my respect until then he not on my pound for pound!"
Me and my family were watching this live and when canelo won,the whole room went crazy lol
0:01 Santa Cruz top right
The final knockdown was pure beat down
I feel bad for plant but not really. His mother and daughter died
What was Caleb saying before the fight?
Plant took heart to keep the fight but dang cánelo lol that foo is in a different level
295 pound canelo  vs 160 plant. Of course he's going to win.
Bro triple g gots nothing on canelo viva Mexico 🇲🇽🏆👑
Canelo the bully of the boxers 😛
Hard to believe Plant made it to round 11. I thought Canelo would do it inside 3. I guess I have to give Plant a bit more respect.
Cherry picker canelo lol 😆 😂 🤣
Clint got planted
Pelea arreglada
Viva Mexico!!! 🥊🇲🇽🥊
PURO COSTAL LE PONEN ASI QUIEN NO
Andy Ruiz in the back like 🗿
VIVA MÉXICO!!!!
I just heard a supposed boxing expert say that he had Plant ahead when he was knocked out. How the heck. People that love the running style are doing to boxing what jiujitsu did to UFC, ruining it. How can the scared fighter, that won't swing, backs up constantly, be winning a contact sport. Ridiculous.
Long live Mexicano!! From dominican 🇩🇴 republic
Ima huge GGG fan but Canelo is a machine. Even tho GGG won one of their three fights and one was a draw.
Plant couldn't do anything but run @ that point . he showed us two things. He has no power and no stamina.
Maybe Caleb Plant should have shown more respect when James Toney was trying to give him a lesson. He may have actually learned something that could have, at least, carried him to a decision.
He power punched thru all the blocks.
All that shit you talk
ALL HAIL THE KING!!! VIVA MEXICO CABRONES
its crazy to see so many people cheering and screaming at one human beating another human. i think we r in hell.
Canelo lets his punches do the talking.   Viva Mexico
YOU KNO WHATS FUNNY U GUYS KEEP TALKING SMACK TO CANELO ABOUT FLOYD MAYWEATHER BUT GUESS WHAT  MAYWEATHER ISNT A UNDISPUTED CHAMPION LOL ITS ONLY 6 ANS CANELO IS IN IT. DONT BELIEVE ME GOOGLE IT  CANELO IS GREATER THAN MAYWEATHER HAHAHAAHAH BIDEN 2024  LETS GO JOSE
He need to fight Jermell Charlo
Plant blows
For all those haters! There's another victory by ko.😂😂😂..who's next fckrs💥💥
That's why we put creatine in our cornflakes son, good fight though
*And THAT folks,is why Canelo is the CHAMP 🏅🏆& not a chump.* 🥊🥊
Please.. Money should come back just to whop his ass again
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!! 🇲🇽🤘🇲🇽❤️🇲🇽
The way canelo ran up to plant after the first knockdown was hilarious! 😂 It was like "where ya goin, where ya goin! Take that!"
Canelo fighting nobodies
Canelo to different smh
Who wins in their prime, Canelo, Mayweather, Duran, Sugar Ray, Paccquio?
The time to have beat Canelo has past. He will not lose again until he is past 34. Too young AND too experienced.
Fucking cheat
Me dio risa la pelea, Solo le Subieron Un esparring más, Plant no pegaba con el puño Cerrado Tanto así Que no sufrió rasguño alguno. Otra más del canelo.
That’s how I would stumble back never have boxed……
Was that a fix? Just seems too Hollywood and perfect. Perfect choreograph. How could a guy like Plant stumble back hands down, be right against the ropes, the. At know out chin perfect for exposure, bent over, giving him his chin, then take two. I am sure a guy like him knows just cover up and cover up while you stumble,  or he was just too unconscious but still, he knows cover up until groggy passes. Very very kinda strange.
Jake Paul is peeing his pants right now
I watched this and it was so fluffing phony but it’s still good to see Mexico is chamo
🇲🇽 🇺🇸...viva canelo cabrones  y Mexico.....
And Mayweather would still beat him!!!
Canelo has had many doubters and haters in his career, some even from our native Mexico that believe he's not as great as other Mexican legends of the sport. This great achievement clears all doubt, felicidades campeon!
He will ALWAYS BE 1 OF FLOYDS BITCHES
Next.....
FLAWLESS VICTORY.
Monster
Been a problem
I'd like Conor Alvarez more if he had black hair like a real Mexican, and if he never did drugs which creates a lifetime of rage.
plant couldn’t back up his words. All talk no action.
You can see Canelo didn't want to pulverize Plant and I applaud both for a Great performance.  @ The end of the day They went home Safe and sound to their Loved ones.  Everything else was a Great promotion.
Why canelos head look so big 😂
Jake Paul really wanted to fight Canelo bruh could barely handle a retired ufc fighter 😂😂😂😂
Congrats Canelo⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🏆 You killed it bro
Ppl keep saying Canelo was exposed, thats the dumbest shit ive ever heard only a hater would say that that. Plant fought a defensive fight the entire fight at no time was plant ever the aggressor not once plus canelo put himself against the ropes to see if plant would trade with him and he was still defensive. Also it takes a lot more energy to be the constant aggressor for 11 rounds and canelo kept the same pace while plant got tired just from being defensive and moving but canelo was moving too. I gave plant the first 2 rounds from there he wasnt the same plus his jab had no power. He still gets major credit and respect but even to the judges eyes canelo was the most active fighter
That's right
You wanna fight? “yeeeuh” gets rocked and fights like shit from then on
This fight reminded me of Canelo v Mayweather.  You can see that plant going to be good but it was too early to go up to the best.... Canelo now in his prime vs prime may would be good now...probably play different...too soon for Plant but good fight
Took him 1 year to unify 168 viva México!!
Almost the same  uppercut that got Saunders, ...Canello is like a mob hitman, he figures you out, your habits, lets you get a bit winded adn than WHAP.
The red didn’t even give him a second to get up on that second knockdown. I’m glad I didn’t pay for this fight, a complete joke, I’m done
Canelo should fight Floyd Mayweather and beat him up real good... So that way Floyd would stop talking all that smack. Canelo should definitely humble Mayweather
Best ever
Canelo luvs knocking people out in the 11rd🇲🇽🔥🔥❤️👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼☠️
Rule #1 cardio, he was not tired at all..
Canelo is on that sauce. 💉 #Steriod Alvarez. 😂🤦🏾‍♀️
0:45 Edy hit harder Canelo then Plant.
F canelo
I saw the fight with my family at home this was the first every boxing match I saw and Canelo amazing, my family got so hyped when he won freaking viva Mexico chants everything
I love how the commentators stayed quiet after the knockdown and proceeded to just watch😭
Floyd beat him
Anyone know the song at 2:20
🤡
Haters going Hate no matter what , like canelo Should face a stronger fighter,  But but Plant did a  he'll of job , almost when to decision, their trying discredit what Plant if he not has accomplished anything by saying he was not a worthy apponent smh, Plant was undefeated until then,  I dare any one else to step in the ring with him lol
Its like watching the greatest gladiator beating his opponents at the coliseum from this era
when Canelo shouted "VIVA MEXICO CABRONES" in the end was awesome!
Canelo running after him that was so funny Keep talking He put that glove in his mouth😂
Little Mike Tyson
Its crazy how he walkin thru boxin and couldn't land a glove on Floyd lol...btw im ah huge canelo fan its just shows how great Mayweather is
Canelo vs Floyd
Dude shouldn't of talked shit about his motha.
Notice how on the first knockdown 3rd shot he could really give him a hard hit and he gives him a tap just to knock him down
Yo no pagaría por ir aver a canelo pelear cuando lo suban con un boxeador bueno no con costal de papas
Man that announcer nailed it! It still gets my hype lol 😂
King Canelo 🇲🇽 💪🏽
Canelo offense head movement like pacquiao  diff like mayweather
Talk shit. Get shook.
Showtime is garbage with the highlights . They need to hire them guys from Dazn .
Brett Favres son can fight!
Canelo is definitely one of the greatest boxers ever. If he goes up to light heavyweight and beats some of the top guys there such as Bivol and Beterbiev, he is probably in the GOAT conversation. But probably not even making that move and staying at 168 he can definitely still make some noise with guys such as Charlo and Benavidez there as well. Who knows what is next, he claims January he will be back, I cannot wait till then.
Please do a drug test to canelo.
Picture perfect
Fixed fight, folks. Make payers’ money worth by going the distance then make it happen towards the end. I’m a Canelo guy but this fight was fixed. Those punches from Canelo were not his hard punches and enough to knock out a super boxer in top shape  as Plant.  Everyone gets a cut and we all go home happy; that’s the boxing of today for the most part and when it’s advantageous for both sides.
Everyone with their phones out is cringe.   Losers enjoy the moment, not look at it through your phone.
Bearded Canelo is most dangerous!
I know not that everyone can receive a proper education in theatre or neuropsychology. This knockout was not staged, he kicked his ass straight and square.
I rather have two pit bulls coming after me than having that man chase me down like he did plant holy shit
A good fight requires great opponents...This fight was all that and a bag of chips baby!😁
Plant should have kept all that shit-talk to himself. Stay quiet against Canelo. That's your best shot at unsettling him... Not letting him know what you're about. Probably still won't work but it's better than talking mad shit and firing him up to knock your ass out lmao
That’s not a knockout.  That’s a Hollywood fake flop down and quit!
No way could Mayweather not get knocked out now
GOAT!!!!
Andy Ruiz is a fucken hater did you guys see him in the back ground no emotions for his so call friend
THAT FIGHT WAS FIXED
I feel they stopped it too early, yes Plant’s only option that night was to lose but I wanted to see Canelo beat on his ass a bit more and make him do the chicken dance.
That Philly Shell/Shoulder Roll defense is beginning to get exposed... Loma exposed it in the Rigo fight with a different strategy and Canelo did too by just showing patience and not falling for the pull back and counter trap they try to set... Watch the fight and notice how Canelo stops short of throwing punches because he's seen that style so many time before
Nelo has the nastiest hooks
canelo to to much for plant canelo p4p King
What happens to all the  trash  🗑 😕  🤷 talk  mmmm never  mind  🤔  we  all  ready  know  the  end
What was really great was how Canelo kept building that momentum after the 1st knock down, like ohhh He's tired. Then chased down Plant where he hit him hard that caused Caleb to go on the ropes and at the point Caleb was going through the pressure, he took a lot of left hooks which Canelo throws really powerful, overall a great fight. I was sad to not see the stage intros that they did before but hey, we got the lead singer of Mana to perform!
Bad Ass
i think canelo suck's
One of the BEST to ever put on a pair of gloves. I’m calling it now… He’s leaving a legacy.
Canelo....well deserved!!!!
Hahaahahha 00:01 mike tyson technic 😊😊😊
I'm a canelo fan but Lara got Robbed. I'm a Canelo fan but GGG got robbed... twice. Still a Canelo fan but ... Mexican meat don't work that way. And the boy is roided up. I just wish he would box clean. Like he did against Cotto and Mayweather. And Trout.... 😏
Beautiful finish by Canelo. 🥊👌😊
Im telling yall  fighters now a days just wanting to get theyre first L from Canelo
O:45 shit Eddie reynoso had the hardest hit on canelo wtf 😆
All these puppy fights for Camelot no names on his hit list Mayweather scared him
Shit talking plant got a painful and humiliating lesson from a more skilled and experienced fighter, Canelo is a methodical and tactical fighter, very patient and relentless..and finally found the opportunity and struck...truly a prime fighter in his time...
Canelo’s boxing is just beautiful to watch !!!
When you have no defense of course you will get knocked out. Tank VS Caleño in few years or even mid next year.
Yeeeeeeesssssssssss 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Where you going plant ,going to a neutral corner for knocking  him down, ok yeah
He should try to unify light heavy i dnt see any1 touchin him scary part is hes still young
Puro costal le ponen
Fake Boxer most Mexican we don't Recognize him as a Grand campeon Mexicano as we claim JSC
Plant's so dizzy from the first knockdown he runs to a neutral corner
David Benavides will be next to get KO
What a bad ass suspenseful fught
the time has come canelo calls out triple g we might see part 3
Fuck Canelo.  Oh, I’m Latino, btw.
Still was stupid to have this on the same night as a real PPV card.. And for less money😂
Canelo is the new King of boxing after Pacman
Canelo never lost to Mayweather, Mayweather ran like a little girl in the ring, to me Canalo is still undefeated
The way Canelo ran towards him kills me all the time 😂💀
After the first knockdown, caleb plant wanted to run all the way back to Nashville Tennessee  but the ropes stopped him😂😂😂😂😂#teamcanelo. #vivamexicocabrones
Good fight Caleb. You're surely going to improve after this.
Y'all need some weird looking Asian kid to beat a Mexican in boxing
Absolute best. Viva Mexico
Why didn't he get another ten count at the end..? He was starting to get up
True
Caleb stood his ground long enough. He should be proud.
This look like some bull shit
I'm glad Plant is ok.  Potentially Canelo could've knocked him out hard enough to turn Plant into a vegetable
Boxing is touch butt with gloves.
NEVER DISRESPECT A MEXICAN, it’s all fun and games online until a MF is in person 🇲🇽👊🏾🇲🇽👊🏾🇲🇽👊🏾
90's roy jones jr. at middleweight would murder and play on canelo all night!!
x big mouth
Viva mexico👏👏👏👏
The Showtime announcers are GARBAGE.....screaming is not announcing, maybe sit and listen to Lampley, THATS how you announce a fight.
Was Caleb bleeding from the ear?
Not Mexicos first... people's memories suck bruh
P4P BUM 💩
Camento se if the ko punch really connected
Damn plant really sucks just let him beat him up the whole time
Clemnelo Albutrez  Maybe the third drug test failure will be the charm all the non-cheaters in boxing are waiting for. They should all go on the tainted beef diet.   Can’t undo the past.
After the first knockout, Canelo came out like a fuking lion ! Going back and fourth to find the perfect shot !
Caleb Plant should have change his style a bit. His stance was vulnerable to left hooks witch is one of the best punch of Canelo. What a great performance from Canelo as always.
Andy Ruiz's face in the crowd at 1:58 lol
ggg beat him and they robbed him. canelo was cheap shotting ggg
Canelo mato la planta jaja
Canelo and jermall need to fight. Charlo vs plant would be a good fight. When they met before the fight you can tell they were sizing each other up.
Pero el caleb bien que hablaba mierda
He beat the breaks off trump
Mexico's 🇲🇽 Crowned 🤴 🥊
estupidas peleas!!!!! con gente de Europa que nadie sabe de ellos!!!!
Looked like a fixed fight, Plant looked like he had No defense,  none.
This was a fake fight. Look at there conversation in the 9th rd smh
Mi gallo
The irishman who speaks spanish ! ]
The illegals' love it !
I missed this fight bcz I been so caught up in basketball!!! Dang it!!!  That’s what plant gets for talking about his mama! Aaayyyyyhhaahhhaaaaaaye!!! Viva la Raza!!! 🇲🇽💗🎉 🥰
Unfortunately down the line when mentioning legends canelo will be  back by the lack of competition he faced.
00:17 traducción al español Ref- ¿De veras, quieres pelear?  Plant- ¡Claro de sí! Ref- lÁndale, pues! Plant- 🤌
Anyone know the song in 1:06 ?
Plant got planted in his own showtime
They never showed planes corner
If you pause at 1:28, you’ll See the Caleb like Canelo get too close.
All that shit talking got beat the fuk up
I really used to enjoy watching Canelo until he turned into Clenelo smh. He chewed up something Eddie gave him before the Plant fight. It's on video
Esa musica enfada
GGG was the only one to stop prime Canelo
Damn.... I can see why they want to build that wall... Bahahahaaaa.
sick fight anyone knows the song name playing at 1:18 ty
Now I believe why Floyd money Mayweather is the best pound for pound he is the only boxer that beat canelo
He has more gold than the King of Mexico had.
Charlo needs to come up to 168 if he wants payday,  Andre Ward will never come out of his retirement,  Benavides cannot give weight, Demetrius Andrade needs to make up a resume, Obama is retired, Goku is the only one left... Lmao!!!
Canelo planted a good one.
Currently the coolest guy on earth 🙌🙌🙌🙌
🗣⚪️🟢🔴
I respect your skills, am I good? You got knocked out dude!
@ 2:00 on the bottom right hand corner ... Who sees him?.
O Caleb… O Caleb… Where’s Caleb? I guess he won’t be talkin too much after this beating.
Never forget to give credit to Mauro for making these moments legendary
The best ever
Rigged
3:35
It’s canelos world we’re just living in it
Why was that fight stopped? 3 knockdown rule. He wasn't badly hurt
This is more fake than a Mexican novela/ soap opera 🤣$
Why do people say Plant fought a good fight no he didn't not once did he put any pressure or even hurt Canelo
You can tell canelo has been waiting to unload his gloves on buddies face since the first press conference 😂 love it
I knew Canelo would win, boys a warrior. That other man be bluffing. 🤣
Weak White Boy!, Once again the Mexican machine  rolls over the United Kingdom.
We know Cat Canelo likes to play with his food "for the fans". He has said that multiple times. He likes to give the people some entertainment. And then he eats his food with a sudden and powerful paw paw. Bang! Dead.
The fight was easy for canelo, the tough part was holding all that gold for the photo. All in a day's work for canelo 🥱
I forgot about this fight tbh. But I knew who the winner would be.
Canelo is a bad man!
0:25🤣🤣🤣🤣 Canelo making homie tap dance
WOW
King canelo
I knew from the pre fight face off who the lion was
Maybe he gets a rematch with Floyd?
I was waiting for "Mama Mia"
Beastmode Canello 😳,any takers 😧???
What are you people on
Canelo using steroids
I loved it when Canelo’s trainer smacked him on the back of the head 😂 like “get your a$$ down kid”
Canelo really did fuck him up🤣
"All hail king canelo"
Plant still had some gas in the tank , he just needed to regain his footing but the ref didn’t allow it
Plant never turned his back and faced his destiny like a true champion.  Salute to both men. They gave there all. Good fight
Anyone can be a undisputed champion if you pay your opponent to lose
@:45 pinche Eddy reynoso le Dio un sape a Canelo😂😂😂
Man I would love to see a Terrance Crawford fight with him...
He carries his punch late because he is so efficient with his punches. One of the many improvements he’s made.
This is gotta be one of my favorite PPV fights now!
MMA fans favorite boxer
This is why Canelo is the BEST period.
Now when are you gonna fight Andrade or Charlo....hmmm??!
I wished I had seen it.
A ese panelo le ponen puro bulto
Dude started running away. Haha
I was there and it was 🔥
Lol how many times can they show the same two punches? It was cool the first three camera angles lol.
This man canelo just stared down the crowd… do you know how badass you have to be not to react after knocking someone out.. mind you, plant was in this fight 👀
Wht is the song they playing in the ring
Lo mejor 😘😘😘😘canelo
That was a NASTY uppercut!  NASTY!
Son golpes de pelucula
It was cool but it’s just shitty there’s like no real competition for canelo literally nobody thought plant had a chance
Dang, Canelo ran through that weight class like the NBA did with the Kardashians.
People giving each other concussions for entertainment: contact sports in a nutshell.
I guess he was not ready for the “ chingasos” 🤔
So similar to BJS KO
If plant would of kept fighting he would of ruined his career
MIN 1:06
I want to see Charlo vs Caleb,  as a matter of fact, let everyone else such as  Benavidez, Charlo brothers, etc  fight each other before coming to get some of that Canelo money and butt kicking, Great performance Canelo, El Rey, con guevos!!  THE CORONATION IS COMPLETE - KING CANELO!!!
😳😳
In Jesus name I cut the process in half The half as in 2018s visit Which was way harder The other half that is 2019s visit Attorneys Selena Mason & Stephanie marón Said there's no database for medical records Those are more private & they don't know to the extent in Texas Redirected me to the Harris center Was gonna be billed $250 if I qualified for their psychiatrist but I didn't 2019s notes were summed up to trash talk Extreme argument between family Wow family feud Common Cain & Abel situation Threaten the safety of my cousin So much easier to dispute & appeal What brothers don't fight? 🤣 Anthony had a daughter I have to pay another psychiatrist an amount of session(s) to show we resolved our beef He has to pay for a daughter for 18 years & beyond when I know how much he wanted a 1st born son 🤣 Depending on my insurance will depend how much I pay financially What makes that different from a professional boxer who talks smack for promo before a fight? A ufc fight In Jesus name amen
They always nice and respectful after they lose 😅
Eat leaves and grass folks
"i did ths shit for mayhico man!"
Who the hell has charlo or bernavides fought to even think they will have a chance against canelo he done woop everybody’s ass their is nothing left for him he is the best thats it he should retire now
Cáñelo beats prime mike tyson
simply the best there is in class/ skill set, power and boxing IQ… took a lil longer give credit to Plant ,but the ending was inevitable  #theking
Hey plant that's what happens when you talk shit 🥊
Canelo the cheater https://youtu.be/GCCLbP_hkqM
Canelo is a hardcore steroider.  He can never be considered a great fighter.  He roided to get ready for the GGG fight and they allowed him to stack his wraps like a plaster cast/cement.
Blah blah blah, Plant will be the guy to take down Canelo.  Sure buddy.
Canelo still soft . Plant wasn’t any big deal whoopty doo fight someone Real Canelo , De la Hoya would’ve Punished Canelo
Goosebumps 💯🔥
Y’all really thought Plant was gonna beat Canelo?😭😭
Known impending destruction.  Not if but when the inevitable fall would come.
A forgone conclusion..
And that's why I won't talk sheet to canelo lol
Stalked for 11 rounds, caught, dismantled, destroyed.
By analogy comparative to watching a furious lion rush in for the kill of an injuries gazelle.
0:25 the way canelo ran to him 😭😭😭
"KING CANELO RULES SUPREME " 🥊👑
I have watched this 50 times lol 😂
Canelo carries power with his deceptive shots.  The red dragon can take you out anytime.  I have a feeling he has an Irish ancestral worrior in his DNA plus that Mexican warrior blood.  Great performance and message to his future challengers.
Defeat speaks louder than  rhetoric .
https://youtu.be/BpnClRfu1ic
Simon que si viva Guadalajara
i haven't seen a fighter seem to RUN away from anyone since Frazier-Foreman I... like he was actively looking for a place to hide...
I didn't expect him to last that long!
Canelo keeps getting better
There's nothing anyone can say about the superiority of Canelo Álvarez The King of Boxing world wide..
Canelo is still underrated. One the most dominant boxers ever! Love how he he's adjusted and continued to only get better over his career.
Ouch..thats boxing
Queen Clenbuterol….strikes again……stop running from Charlo(s), Andrade, Benavidez…
come on...were you expecting anything less? We all knew he wasnt beating canelo.
Mexico always has the best fighters.
Oh and BTW, your not in Mexico, your in America! Could you make American money in Mexico? Show some respect to America and speak english. You say your doing this for Mexico? Doing what? Taking their money? Be like Pac and put your money into Mexico to help them. Support the people you say your doing it for. Help your country.
Caleb Plant was a game fighter but lets face it , he is not a world class fighter (yet). Canelo knows this, which is how he decides to take fights. Can I beat him? Yes! An IBF Champion with zero loses is the equation needed to fight Canelo. Please! Canelo fight the top tier fighters! Your ducking the best by your maneuvering with the BS belts, and  different weight classes..You wont fight Charlo, you wont fight Andrade, and Im sure you wont fight Ward until he is maybe another 2 years older . Why not Pac back in the day? because you would have lost. The lb for lb GOAT Cherry Picker!
Canelo droppin fighters for their first time n their career over and over!! That''z rite Canelo handle your scandal and Viva Mexico!!
This guy stood no chance. Idk why people are surprised, did you really expect and believe plant was gonna win?
Plant was hurt. He was limping
This was the only way the fight was ever going to go. Canelo is just one of the best to ever do it and Plant was always just a whipping boy. He made a ton of money from this fight so Plant should just be thankful for the money and lesson and move on.
Ref: Hey. Hey. You KO'd bro? Plant: Yeah. Totally out on my feet. Yep. Ref: Alright, let's get back into it! Plant: 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️
Plant was a garbage fighter
Opened that big mouth too much .
Hmm one SUPRCLEAN SHOT TO BACK OF THE EAR ALL OTHERS TO THE GLOVE/BLOCKED OR MISSED.FOLDED LIKE A LAWN CHAIR?
Funny tho FURY GOES DWN & GIVEN ALL THE TIME TO GET UP...JUST SAYN
Canelo was doing a sport here is he was fighting for real! His only motivation is to destroy Plant, he don’t care about title or money.
BUY DOGELON
Canelo in his prime is the best there ever was. True goat. Not like those other name collectors and can crushers.
when plant made it personal, so did canelo.
I can only imagine all the 🐱🐱🐱 that's coming to him bahahahahah
Chavez style K.O.
Mexican supplements are great
I haven't watched the entire fight yet I'm not sure if it was even close or not but did anyone think the stoppage was maybe a bit premature considering the high level they are on. But who knows the high level of boxing is what makes it not premature maybe idk. Asking for sincere responses because I'm a little ignorant on this subject. Canelo is an animal, it's awesome to be able to watch him fight. Canelo vs GGG were some of the most exciting fights, I was a huge gigantic fan of Gennady to it's a shame he hasn't fought in awhile. I honestly believe Gennady won the first fight with Canelo but I think Canelo won the 2nd if anyone did.
You know something is wrong when you came to fight but you start jogging
Ive never seen a professional fighter being scared, of getting hit. Towards the end it was clear Plant was scared of getting punched, and didn’t want to fight anymore.
I like how when Canelo charged at him at 0:22 he showed him his right hand first and Plant's reaction was to put up his shoulder and Canelo immediately threw another left bomb.
This is the guy Jake Paul is trying to call out by the way.
Plant put up a good fight.. all respect, REY CANELO 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Watch it in slow motion it's very satisfying, won't be disappointed lol
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
How is it that in the replay the audio is live?!?! Hahahaha De La Hoya Mafia… this is coming for years…
Canelo be sending these fighters to the ground and to the hospital!!! These are facts Canelo passes Mayweather  in his prime these are facts! All Mayweather did was gain points and try to survive yes that’s smart hit and don’t get hit but we all see it Canelo he is way better then mayweather and plus mayweather lost to Chino Maidana that’s why Floyd wanted that rematch lol. Canelo is in another level 🔥🔥🔥
Hahaha he planted buenos putazos. King Canelo
Even the boxing experts prognostics backfired, Canelo showed why he’s the Champ
Ive seen this video 100 times...🤣🤣🤣love it. Sige callando osicos CANELO
Slow mo at 1:56 and tell me that Caleb didn’t get rocked by that huge left hook
There too much money involved, canelo can’t loose, it’s just a show , he just leet him win
There is good news in this world, this world full of darkness, full of people that try to prove that they are better than someone else. I have bad news, we are all bad in Gods eyes, no not a single person is good. What does that mean? It means that we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and we all need a saviour. Jesus Christ came to this earth and died for all of our sins, he even died for the ones that killed Him! Why? Because He loves you and wants you to spend eternity with Him in paradise,  So turn from your sin, and trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and saviour, every day we are getting closer to His return. Do you want Him to recognize you as his own? Or His enemy? I don't want to be His enemy!
“All hail king Canelo” will give me chills forever
Caleb plant did pretty well in the first few rounds. Was skilful, landing beautiful shots, landed beautiful combos. Was accurate and did well defending and slipping. Canelo’s punches wer just to powerful for plant to handle which is why those body shots started to crumble plant.
Give that guy a map, where was plant trying to go
Eso le pasa por meter con mexicano
Kind of new the outcome from the press conference
BRING THAT RUNAROUND  POS MAYWEATHER FOR A REMATCH, CANELO WILL KNOCK HIM OUT LIKE JOE LOUIS KOD MAX SCHMELING.
CALEB SAID HE WAS GOING TO GIVE CANELO "LOS CHINGASOS" AND CALLED HIM MF .CANELO GAVE HIM REAL CHINGASOS AND DROPPED HIM TWICE VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!!
Mexicanos al grito de Guerra!!! MI MEXICO HERMOSO 🇲🇽
Would be pretty funny if the boxers wore masks.
Canelo whooped Plant easier than he can carry his belts.
I think the slap Eddy gave Canelo at 0:45 was the most punishment he took all night 😂 Canelo looked back still with that killer instinct 😅
Floyd did say he was the future of boxing after their fight.
Boxing won.
Steroids wins again....another clean fighter loses his belt to canelos steroid power...wut a shame
It was a good fight. I don’t know about you guys. In the 3rd round, Canelo did reopen the cut that he gave to Plant under his right eye.
Caleb Plant, gets to say bye, bye to his one and only belt.  He really schooled Canelo. NOT!
Plant builds everything off his jab his rhythm tool to set his tone canelo took that away from him and it was done
I said in the beginning that plant only weapon was his legs once he went flat footed he started to get caught thought it would of been earlier but I was proven wrong . But one was caught it was over the surprise on plant face when he started to run and canelo was right behind him was worth the wait.
CALEB GOT KNOCKED THEE FUCCK OUT!
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Canelo hasn’t fought Charlo all these years. When you see Canelo fighting guys like Avni Yildirim, Rocky Fielding, Billy Joe Saunders, Callum Smith, and now Caleb Plant instead of Charlo, that tells you all you need to know.
He should fight Mayweather. Lol. Thing looked easy or fixed.
What a beautiful   🇲🇽  !!!!
Meanwhile everyone else still ducking each other
The Mexican Thanos
LE DIO CUELLO
Canelo es feroz
Canelo is a like a little chucky doll waiting to get to plant while the ref is counting. Lol.
Canelo could of ended that fight earlier plants welterweight punches were no threat, looked like canelo waited him out and went for the finish late
Are we not going to give the DJ CREDIT he had dancing on a Monday night 🤣 🙌🏽
Referee stop the figth too soon!
Plant went for the hug right after the hook got him, but Canelo did great to push him back and make room for that uc. Nicely done.
That was an early stoppage
Great fight on both but canelo needs a real challenge enough of this MMA FIGHTER'S THEIR NOT PROFESSIONAL BOXERS.LETD SEE PAC MAN FIGHT HIM
Some real turn up music for after the win https://youtu.be/wlqJNH81nUw 🔥🔥
andy ruiz in the back with a smile lol
One Word: Discipline.
What was plant thinking talking like that going into a fight with canelo throwing nothing but pillow punches all night, I thought. Plant had power that's why I gave him a chance.
That was soooooo  Satisfying.  Long live the king .
Canelo be the thanos of boxing collecting all these infinity stones or in this case all these belts
Damn, he was running like a lil biaaatch
That's what Plant gets for wearing those shorts...
IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR. CANELO ÁLVAREZ HAS UNIFIED ALL 4 168 LBS BELTS.  KING CANELO RULESSSSS SUPREEEEEMEEEEE. 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Respect to both. It's tough
I can’t get over this small clip. I keep coming back to watch this over and over again lol KingNelo!
Thanos colectando todas las gemas😅 thanelo
Im a fan of canelo but do ppl not know what a KO is??
The way the crowd sounds in the first minute of this video 🤯.... 🤠🤙🏼 Only the great  ,make the people sound like that... A true gladiator... 🇲🇽🤘🏼🤠
His last few fights are spars thats how good he is he’s dismantling champions.
Canelo is not of this world. The fact that even the most top tier competition looks like they are lagging behind against him is INSANE. He is genuinely a world beyond anyone else in the squared ring.
Definitely fight if the year!!!!!!!!
🥊🥊
Damn is that Andy Ruiz bottom right 2:08? Lol
All hail Satan . I mean canelo lol
Look at andy ruiz in the back all sad  they need to kick him to the curve from team canelo
What else did yall expect? Canelo planted plant. He's one of the greatest Mexican boxers and great in general! 🇲🇽
Canel is so awesome. Viva Mexico
Andy Ruiz with no expression
Im actually excited for Plant's next fight!!!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1fTKHqMFGV0
Canelo was simply a better fighter.
Good job! Canelo👏🏻👍🏻💪🏻👊🏻 viva Mexico gueyes😂😆🤼
What is the name of the Spanish song that was playing?
I knew plant wasn’t ready but shit
UNDISPUTED VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽
#AwesomeKO 💪👊👏 🌟🔥 NOW you can call Caleb 🐔not a 🐓
Great fight, but no GGG/Canelo 1 and 2
Easy money. 👍
The best boxer in the planet 🌎
Matthew 24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
I always been a Chavez fan but my respect and administration for canelo. First Mexican fighter to be undisputed champion wow truly amazing.
Canelo looked terrible thru rounds 1-10. Plant was controlling the fight. Crazy how 1 crazy punch can change the whole momentum and result of a fight
Canelo 👑 I still respect Caleb 👏 he still a champ 🏆 but Canelo is a King 🤴
Canelo and Tyson Fury are the only two things keeping boxing alive and beating.
Lets be honest here!!! Canelo isn’t facing the best of the best!! He is going after belts he doesn’t have!! So on paper it looks good! But who is he really facing? Washed up has beens? Like cotto? I want to see a big name, like a GGG trilogy, or The undefeated charlo brother, Benavidez, Teofimo lopez, so many big names he can be facing! But he doesn’t! O well! What r ya gonna do
This settles it. It's time we get Canelo vs Goku. 💪💪
I've been watching boxing now for many years. All weight classes and styles. In my humble opinion Canelo is the best fighter I've ever seen. So much skill and just uncanny timing. A trained master at his craft. It's  just a pleasure to watch him fight. Glad I was here to see it. To me Alverez is the essence of boxing skill.
Plant has been planted 😎👍

He still would not be able to f*** with Mayweather.

Good fight. My respects to Plant, he has good boxing skills and gave Canelo trouble.  Decision was his only shot, could not make it a brawl.
He needs more ppl to help holds his belts when he wins
Canelos uppercuts are so fucken bad ass
If I were Caleb I would look to my girl and say , did you see what I just did ? I took a beating so we can have a good life , I did what a man does , I'm hungry I want something to eat and after that you owe me some good head , and after that I need some good sleep .
Viva Canelo, i watch this fight Saturday night n I'm still talking about it, Viva Mexico 🥊🥊
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Should’ve lost to GGG
Jermall and Jermell now may have their shot. Canelo can pick and choose at this point.
Can I just ask did anyone for one second think Canelo would lose?? And was that the only good fight? I feel bad for anyone who paid to watched plant get pulverized over ufc 268. I mean who cares about canelo fighting nobody's lol. 🤷
0:01 * IS THAT ANDY RUIZ JR IN THE CROWD*
Anyone want the fight link?
Canelo is the Boogeyman at 168 lb 💪💪🥊🥊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
plant was better fighter than I thought
I swear, Mexicans are taking over boxing again :D
it must suck knowing you have almost a 70% chance of getting knocked out going into the ring with canelo.
HAIL KING CANELO!!!!!
Amen Jesus loves you God bless God loves you God bless Jesus Christ died in the cross for your sins and God rose Jesus Christ from the dead three days later give your life to Jesus Christ and repent from your sins before it’s to late and Jesus Christ is coming soon nobody knows when will he come back only God knows so please repent from your sins before it’s to late and give your life to Jesus Christ and HELL Is nothing to joke about because it’s a torture and burning please repent from your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ and believe with all your heart all your soul all your strength that Jesus is lord and are lord and savior and king a believe with all your soul all your mind all your heart all you strength that Jesus Christ died in the cross for your sins and God rose Jesus Christ from the dead three days later believe it amen God bless God is good Amen

Pitty Pat Plant
3:59 🇲🇽🇲🇽
A Brutal knockout to become the first undisputed champion at 168 in history and first ever Mexican undisputed champion of all time. WOW. it really doesn’t get better than that. canelo won this easy 8 rounds canelo. Everyone and they momma, even Dana white was watching this fight
Caleb Plant is a warrior, I don't care if you guys agree with me or not. Dude is Legit a warrior.
Fake shit right there canelo is but a 🤡
Arriba mi canelo viva Mexico 🇲🇽 cabrones puro corazon
Perfect example of cocky fighters getting shut down
The da faq caleb say he will be in the inside when he was on the outside all night. Great job canelo for unifying the division
I cant stop watching this. Just like I couldn't stop watching the Saunders KO either.
Pbc commentators was saying it was an even fight going into to 11..lol
Canelo wife 👀 back at that man behind her and was like Damn he is screaming at my man harder than me
VAMOS CANELO! #CANELOTEAM #KINGCANELO
Wasn't born the Chavez era but am proud to be alive the nelo era! 🔥🔥🔥
6 feet and 3 inches is a long way to fall down.........tough talk usually belies fear.....he did the same thing as Saunders (bending at the hip to avoid body shots and hooks) and ended the same way...ducking INTO a powerful uppercut~ good night irene!
Canelo would’ve destroyed mayweather if it was later in his career.
Canelo is an amazing man.  He's the type that we get every couple of decades or so...you could say once per generation.  Even Floyd didn't have the panache of this man...even though he overall WAS a better "fighter".  Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard, they all brought more to the sport than just good hands and a good chin.  They brought CHARISMA.  And the fact that Canelo does it without the false bravado of Leonard, or the gratuitous viciousness of Tyson, or even the self aggrandizement of Ali, is very refreshing.  The young man (I think 31 is young) is humble in victory, was VERY gracious in his one defeat, and even forgave Plant for insulting his mother.  Canelo is more of a man than ME, in this respect.  Insult my MOTHER?????  No way.  There is class, and there is CLASS.  Plant showed no class in insulting Canelo, calling him a "motherf@#$%^&", and telling him to F off, etc.  Canelo showed CLASS in forgiving him.  Mr. Alvarez is a REAL MAN.  I am in awe of him as a boxer AND a man.  God Bless him and his family.  Viva Mexico!
Callum Smith was 28-0 now he 28-1 Billy Joe Saunders was 30-0 now he 30-1 Caleb Plant was 21-0 now he 21-1 These are good fighters but canelo makes them look like a punching bag lol
*THE CHAMP IS HERE*
NOVEMBER TO REMEMBER 💯 Scorpio Season is lit 🔥 ♏️  point proven 11th round  oh yea  upcoming bday 11/17 💪🏼🦁
At the same age, Canelo would give Mayweather a beating any day of the week.
Sad that Americans were cheering for Canelo more than Mexico Mexicans
I feel sorry for the opponent  And I'm Mexican 😔
Anybody knows the music title in the background?
Oh, he is a white Mexican.  Literally.  That's interesting.
He did the same thing to Billy Joe with that uppercut
They both acted with class after the fight....all's well that ends well.
When Plant got hurt, if one of the monster rights by Canelo landed, he would be in the hospital and maybe even forced to retire. Good for him Canelo missed.
Simply the Best in the world and one the Best in history Canelo Canelo
Takeaway:  after the win notice Canelo did not call out anyone as in prior wins. No Beterbiev that's for sure.
Le doy  un año mas a canelo siempre cada 5 año sale alguien mejor donde estara esa nueva estrella del boxeo

Canelo the face of combat sports. Period!
What I say easy fight
Canelo vs Goku
Sheeeeesh
Please repent for your lord he will give you salvation and everlasting life in the kingdom he lives in for therefore nothing on this planet can replace what's in the kingdom of God he will save you from the sins you have committed and forgive you and restore your heart with his love and give you strength and happiness that you will never experience with things on earth WARNING! if you don't repent you will end up in hell a place where you don't want to be in no-man nor woman would ever want to experience such a place where you will be tortured for all eternity 🙏🏿❤
If Bud win his upcoming fight....he needs to fight Canelo
@50 seconds-55 seconds look at plants left ear. It's bleeding.
Josh Taylor could beat Canelo
Talked all that shit and lost 😂man doesn’t deserve a rematch
DAZN has better highlights this is bush!t
Anyone know what song is playing at 2:36?
Ffffff all y'all canelo haters
Talking all that shit about Canelo… then you get TKO’d.
Would like to see Canelo vs Venabidez, I know canelo will beat him but I think it will be a good fight.
Why couldn't we have ward calling the fight
What will happen after he loses? Just another boxer after that.
I’ve gotta say, after this and Fury-Wilder III, Russell Mora gained my respect as a referee since the Mares-Agbeko fiasco.
Canelo did the … damm the towel is too far for me to reach run ..
Bible verse of the day to remember if you're feeling down: “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭40:8‬ ‭
Wish Floyd was 20 years younger so he can beat Canelo again
His wife is 🚬
Say what you say 👊😎
Canelo in his prime rn he finna dominate for a minute watch
And the face of boxing Canelo who's next my friend 👊😎🤣
Never forget..... Mayweather schooled this muchacho lol
His hands weren't so sweet after all.
Maybe they can afford the to pay for the border wall now lmao.
10 rd and a punch lands like that not have it fake bitches. All Mex paid him off lmao.
Greenpeace is taking canelo to court due  cruelty to plants
Plant was plucked up by a Canelo undercut. If only he had dodged the undercut then Plant would have gone the distance. Not many fighters have gone the distance with Canelo. Oh, well, and that’s how the story goes. Better luck next time.
Canelo whipped his ass, no way Plant was going to win that fight.
Mexican song???
The run of canelo looking like Mac from punch out
Andy Ruiz chilling on the bottom right at 2:01
Just another victim for canelo! But caleb still up ther! Take a loss nd bounce back champ.
BAM Bad ass meskin
Canelo is Mexican.
Canelo...!!! Pound per pound.!!!! ...now what Caleb......
Saul “Thanelos” Alvarez.
This dude trash mayweather beat his into being racist knw he won’t fight black fighters 😂 how sad
Sow what now?  Who can take canelo down ? Real talk
KABOOOOOOOOM! DUDE WENT DOWN! MEXICO! #1😁😆😅🤣😂🙃😉😊🙂💯💯💯👻🤡🎲🎲🎲🎲🎲🎲
All these Hypocrites who say "all Caleb needs to do is "box and move". Yet when Floyd did it with his style he's called a runner? They don't know nothing about the "Sweet science of boxing". Stick and move. And Plant is no Mayweather that's for sure. Canelo stop his noise. White boy down and out!
The slap in the back of the head at the end by eddy was the hardest hit that night canelo took
Canelo is just a damn beast aint noone beating him anytime soon until hes old and out his prime
What's the name of the song playing ?
Canelo 💯💯💯
I can’t watch this dude ever since Floyd schooled him.
Put some RESPECT on that man💪
i’m a big canelo fan. very good fight plant definitely gonna come up again a fighter i am excited to watch in the future!
It's like I'm watching nacho libre... they already know who's going to win lol especially WBC president. He's all over canelos balls.
Do the stanky leg , do the stanky leg
Plant took his ass down like a champ nothing but respect for stepping up
CANELO LETS GO VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽
Respect to both boxers.  It was actually a good fight.  However please stop with this best of all time.  Floyd (who I hate)  is the best to ever do it.  And also put on a clinic against Canelo.  But respect to Canelo for taking fights that make boxing somewhat watchable these days.
the real king is his juice
All hail King Canelo. Boxing’s biggest attraction since Floyd Mayweather
Im still waiting to see this crazy uppercut did I blink and miss it?
Plants eyes when he saw canelo coming back for him for the kill was like “oh on”
I give Jake Paul 30 seconds, 35 tops.
Canelo is a beast.
Ariba canelo puñeta que Viva nuestro Hermano mexico desde Puerto Rico
Plants still slick! Dodges punches nicely even when he's out on his feet
They should of stopped it, that unnecessary damage to a man
Plant should’ve stayed underground like his roots.
Mauro never dissapoints in commentary
he still cant win Floyd Mayweather chilll out canelo
How you like them apples? Andre ward :)
He would never do Floyd like that tho and that’s on y’all’s life
Caleb was doing well at first but he wasn't ever sitting down on his right hand like bro you can't tap Canelo with jabs and win the fight. Canelo is just soooo fuckin good it's ridiculous I don't see anyone beating him anytime soon besides GGG.?
I didn’t get to see this fight who was winning on the scorecards up until this point? Assume Canelo
Q buen trabajo mijo, ay sigele campion
"Face Plant" ✅
The only person who beat canelo was Floyd Mayweather.. nobody eles is gonna beat him 😎
Canelo, julio chavez 2.0? Undisputed champion...congrats, plant got planted🙄😁
Canelo,"THANKS SOOOOOOOO MUCH FOR REPRESENTING THE MEXICAN AMERICANS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN!!!!!!!!  Remember you promise to become a United States Citizen when you sign those documents to become an American!!!!!! I'm sure you ALSO represents"MEXICO!!!" How can anyone LIVE his or her "❤ HEART WHERE YOU WAS BORN???   "WISH YOU THE BEST "PAISANO !!!!!!!!!"  "ONLY IN AMÉRICA". HOME OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOUR DREAMS CAN BECOME "REALITY!!!!!!!!"  "NO MESS AN A AMÉRICA!!!"
The referee should be fired. Why did he stop the fight? He didn't even bother giving a 10 second count. Caleb still showed signs that he was still alive.
I guess he was not “listo para los chingazos” lol 😂 he talked so much trash and got schooled
This canelo would destroy floyd don't give a 💩 what the haters say. This is a very bad hombre
😂😂😂😂....
😱WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MY MADRE😻💖💞🐾🐾🐾💐💞💖💖?🤠🤠🤠🍳🍳🍳OOPS! YOU ARE KNOT DOWN😂😂😂😂
I really thought this white dude jaded it in HIM!!!!!  I mean the way he was talking and bragging about how tough he was and was going to KNOCK Canelo out!!!!!!
Royalty"MEXICO".
Canelo Alverez the 🐐
Jesus comes 1st. Exodus 20:8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Exodus 20:9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, Exodus 20:10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. Exodus 20:11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
you can see that plant's body literally shut down for like half a second
0:26 Idk why but that little run he does makes me laugh
Never say anything bad about anyone's mother, fighter or not. Plant got what he deserved.
Great fight
Plant vs Saunders would be an  interesting match up
Canelo haters still going to be like he still ducking Frieza, Goku and thanos lol 😆
Tim Bradley called the flaw with Plant dipping to his right. He called a left hook.
Al final, Canelo bufa como un toro.
King Canelo🥊
#1
Canelo is the KO king!
A canelo le ponen pura basura creo queen peleo major llo que ese barbon no trae nada de robaron las entradas
Canelo is such an awesome and exciting fighter, it's unfortunate the boxing powers that be had to hold him up versus GGG, twice. Hopefully he quits running from the trilogy fight.
that floyd shit don't work huh.
It takes GGG type power to be competitive with Canelo.  Without it, forget about it. He'll get you eventually.
Congratulations Junior Crome the Boxing Master sends his regards.
Quisieron aser lo legendario de Barrera vs terrible desde q empezaron con sus enpujunsitos en el pesaje noc es loq puedo ver y eso q no vi la pelea loque más redactan los q ablan Pa eso dejen A Nacho Breistain
When canelo run to finish plant that was phenomenal.
Should of never fought mw
The left hook Canelo missed with right before the 2nd knockdown was meant to really knock Caleb out the damn ring. Plant’s reflexes saved him from losing alot of brain cells
Floyd somewhere saying, he never did that to me lol😄😄😄
Plant got planted in the ground like a  🌺. ⚰️
Viva Mexico
I'm Mexican and all I'm gonna say it doesn't seem like he fights any blacks or Mexicans🤔 which to me are the best boxers just my opinion. And we all know what happened when he boxed a black champion that was almost 40.
Marty really doesn't want any of this man! Canelo is a different level athlete!
Prime Canelo vs prime Mayweather
It was a leaping left hook, not an uppercut.
Plant ain't got no foot work he was winning the first 4 rounds , and that philly shoulder roll he ain't the master of it when he got caught against the ropes he had cement shoes like a sitting target he could of won, but as Canelo told him there are levels, and plant just been fighting pure tow truck drivers
Damm sóbate papá
Ok David Benavidez is next. Canelo better not duck him.
A huevo a un mexicano nunca perdera ante un americano aaaa
Usman would get destroyed in a boxing match. Even Jake Paul is to much for Usman in boxing.
Way better fight than Billy Joe Quitters'.
Clearly that was a dive. Plant sold out
Dr. Canelo reporting for surgery.
Carnelo vs Andre Ward
pinche eddy hit canelo hahahaaha
Lesson learned: Never Insult *Canelo*
https://youtu.be/neFT0U7IWRg The unspoken file video. Thank me later
Teo and his coked out daddy up there trying rally tribal support by screaming "latino latino" next to canelo 😂 mexicans how yall feel about that?
I honestly think he could beat Floyd if they were both in their prime
What’s the song playing at 1:30
I KNOW DANA WHITE IS HAPPY! HE PUT 100K ON CANELO BY KO. Musta been shittin himself for 11 rounds tho lol
could Canelo Beat Mayweather, if they fought again?
Great fight. I give my props to plant. Went 11 rounds with the best. This will make him a great fighter.  King canelo. Viva mexico
Caleb Plant really impressed me. Canelo is king and of course won the bout.  But Caleb Plant stepped up and proved to everyone that he belongs at the top.
Canelo gotta fight benavidez now
Mas chignon...good Caleb
I like how there’s a light on Mike Tyson makes him stand out 🤣
i was 100% going for canelo the whole time. but i really like caleb plant too. caleb is fun to watch to be honest. i kind of feel bad for him getting taken out like that but canelo is just way too skilled. congrats to canelo and huge respect to caleb plant. noth delivered an awesome night of boxing for the fans. really the whole card was exciting. way to go showtime!
Lmao the way Canelo was running after him 😂🤣🙌🏽 “come here boy!”
Canelo with the "gotta take a shit" run at :26 lmfaoooooo
Cardio.
At 2:00 you can see Andy Ruiz in the bottom right corner 😂😂
he ded 0:32
Something that DAZN does better than everyone else is show all the fights all the time on there app
LIES LIES CANELOS OPONENTS ARE POTATOS SACK,IS ONLY ENTERTEINMENT VIVA MEXICO$$$$$$$
PURA MENTIRA TODOS LOS OPONENTES DE CANELO,SON SACOS DE PAPAS  PURO ESPECATCULO VIVA MEXICO$$$$$$$$
Song in the background what is it
Floyd don't want this fight
The way he ran at 0:30 😭
Por fin canelo gano una pelea limpia!
Still laughing at that first knockdown and Plant running corner to corner then running away with 2 minutes left LMAO.
Wheres all Canelos Haters!!????????   Puro CANELO perrrraaaaaaaasssssss."!!!!!!!🤜🤛👊👊👊👊 plant fans👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
siempre le he tenido fe al canelo. no solamente es ídolo en México,  los que no somos mexicanos y vivimos 3n otros países lo admiramos también. tiene una pegada contundente.  verlo boxear es muy emocionante
I'm ready for a Canelo vs  Mayweather part 2
NOT IMPRESSED.....NOW GO FIGHT A REAL CHAMPION
Jake Paul would win
The crowds oohs then them singing the song was pretty goated can't lie lmao
Canelo the Goat fr
GGG....
Man that was one of the best pillow fights I've seen. There was a bunch of good non pillow fights that the ufc put on. These pillow  fighters will never want to fight in the ufc without there pillows.
Great job Canelo! Put him on check

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
#TEAMCANELO
Canelo just DIFFERENT bro.
I would love to see Canelo now vs Mayweather back when they fought. That would be an amazing fight!
man just crumbled
Canelo can't be beat
Wow the mighty plant lost after getting the best advise from the coward Ward.
Best referee thank you
Gaethje vs Chandler was better
Canelo did a little mariachi dance getting to Plant after that first knockdown. He knew Plant was out on his feet. Good stoppage, no sense in letting Plant go on.
canilo doesnt do it for mexico or mexicans he does it for himself he only says he does to get fans
When your mouth writes a check your ass can't cash.
Canelo lost both fights to GGG and the Kovalev fight was a fix.
It just feels good to be a F.....g Mexican with big balls.😎 big loco East los angeles califas 💯 🇲🇽 🇺🇸.
They both did there job and only one is champion 🏆 go to Canelo
Anyone of the Charlo brothers knocks out Canelo and he knows it ...that’s why they advise him to stay away from that heat...Canelo rise as Steriod champion is false and bullshit
Face of boxing 👉🏻🇲🇽
0:01 When you hear Canelo exhaling like that you better watch out my man! GODDAMMIT!
4 bouts in 12 months against quality opponents said it all! Get some rest young man & let your body heal properly.
Como nunca hizo nada de eso con GGG 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Was there ever a doubt honestly people we all new this was gonna happen.
:19 Is that Mike Tyson???
In 11 months he took out all Champions in the division, gave 3 fighters their 1st ever Ls, and became undisputed.
Jake Paul is better
Lol profesional bóxers need to just kneeled and take the L then hits had him look for hope lol.
What a barbaric sport
And the referee asking the fighter who just hit the mat “do you wanna fight?”  Who in that moment is going to say no?
I think plant could have kept going he deserved a count. He got up right away
Showtime making money off somebody - two people, actually - getting brain damage
Canelo has gotten real lucky fighting arguably the weakest generation of fighters in boxing history.
NEXT TIME KEEP SOMEONES MOTHERS OUT YO MOUTH..
Damn one of da best fights I eva seen #knockout crazy 11 round da best, I see u nelo🥊🥊🥊😠😠💯💪
The winner was expected but I did not expect the fight to be this good
King Canelo
Maybe canelo is ready for the goat Jake Paul after this
Plant lost his legs
They gave him that fight
Chin got broken
Plant will disappear into obscurity!!! Plants ego will never be the same!!! He became part of history on the wrong end!!
Canelo wasn’t letting that one go! 🙏
I guess canelo was right when he said : I'm gonna fuck you up motherfucker fucking motherfucker motherfucker
white man can fight good.
Don't think anyone can beat Canelo. GOAT. Ops sorry except Mayweather.
Haters be like: Yeah, but Canelo is still ducking Chuck Norris.
Darkseid beams scared tf out of Caleb Plant after the first knock down.
RUN RUN RUN HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
The wife is like "yeah baby make me that money!! I'm buying a new Corvette!!"
"All hail King Canelo, Viva Mexicos First undisputed champion!" I got chills when he said that. Shout out Caleb Plant, he can bounce back.
Caleb Plant is so cringe.
They stop fights way too early now a days .... Not this one in particular this one may have needed stopped but the old fights you can see people come back from this kind of trouble and win the fight ... These guys get into boxing knowing the risks let them fall on their shield!!
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
https://youtu.be/UTQTXWuAw9M
Man I can’t stop coming back to this fight
Plant lacks the power to keep Canelo off of him
That hook that's started the beginning of the end was so beautiful.  Dip low and come up with a hook.💪💪💪
At this point I’m pretty sure Canelo was simply toying with plant till the 10th round 😂
He thought he had it all set using the mayweather shoulder roll 💀
The part where he pushes Caleb Plant after the first shot to set him up for the next shot , canelo is a demon 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🌶🌶🌶🌯🌯 viva Mexico cabrones !!
Canelo did a Mike Tyson move.
Caleb got Planted
With so many great Mexican fighters I can't believe Canelo is the first to do it. Good job champ!
ima be honest I thought caleb had it but stlest 11 rounds
P4P King 🤴🏽🇲🇽
Plant showed a lot of heart. It’s not about how many times you get knocked down.
Bad man.
Amazing the amount of power he has in the 11th round
Love the way Canelo was running 🏃‍♀️ after Plant
I think Canelo was pissed bc Plant wore fringe on his shorts and had to knock him out for it
🐐
Maywuader
I don't even care to watch one single Caleb plant fight and knew this guy was going to lose
I wish they'd stop trying to compete with the UFC and fight on different nights. Then I could've watched it. If I gotta pick between one or the other the UFC ALWAYS wins.
Leonard Ellerbe and Andre Ward ...you guys were wrong!!! Canelo knocked out your boy.
lately his fights look to easy. I wonder if NDAs are used when negotiating.
All right canelo was just sizing up Caleb and it was just a matter of time that canelo would knock him out 💪😎
plant got heart but canelo got the win
Such a good luck for floyd canelo woulda annihilated him if he was older
Easy work for Canelo
4 Fights 4 Title Belts 4 piece combination to finish Plant off.
Without any exaggeration I felt electricity in my blood for minutes
Wow, does Canelo ever get tired? This man is a savage.
M pregunto....si canelo rompió los récords de todos los boxeadores mexicanos..kien será el número 1 de todo México asta hoy .canelo o julio cesar chavez
@0:21 Mike Tyson is in awe.
All hail King Canelo!!!
I bet if some of you in the comments took steroids you could be like canelo
Canelo I got caught taking steroids Alvarez
Why wasn't plant using his right arm?
Damn he threaded the needle sneaking that left hook in past the guard 👀
Watching this live at the MGM Grand  was amazing, the crowd atmosphere was electric I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Bucket list goal to witness the P4P King in his prime up close & personal while being part of history. Later I could tell my grandkids I was there at the MGM when the first ever Mexican/Latin American was crowned Undisputed while also crowning the first ever Super Middle Weight Undisputed in Boxing history.
Thank you Mayweather for unleashing this beast smh

that fight was nothing better than coming back with THREE GGG
Let's be honest, we all knew this was going to be the outcome.
😄🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Best in the world !! 🇲🇽
He isn't undisputed... He fucking lost to Mayweather...  Ranallo is the dumbest commentator, I swear
Id like to see canelo vs pacman but they would probably protect canelo from that fight
Mexico 🇲🇽!!!!!
Not only is Canelo one of the greatest Mexican fighters of all time but he is one of the greatest in general.
Ain't no more denying this Man's greatness anymore. He's unified the 154, 160 and 168 lbs divisions. Won an additional title in 175 lbs and has now unified all 4 belts at 168. He's this generation's Manny Pacquiao. What a guy. Give him his props, he's an all time great no matter what else happens. To be honest, he can retire now and no one should complain. He's beaten everyone critics have told him to fight.
If your reading this invest in shiba you won’t be disappointed hold don’t sell you’ll be surprised it’s better than this KO
Mr Plant was doing the Zab Juddah dance. I knew it was over.
That's typically how it goes with Americans. Talk all big and act prideful then get shut up
Damn! 11th round Left hook, right uppercut 🥵
Damn that’s the Loudest I’ve ever heard a crowd!!!!
How Plant get caught with that ... Canelo is that dude
Sorry pro canelo but he's not the best,he need to fight a Mexican or brother in the hood, not this type of  soft fighers,canelois out not worth it to watch.
GGG destroyed poquito canelo
Bro if you expected a different outcome especially how boxing is setup this decade? Ur One hell of a hidiot.
Look to me Plant was running for the door but in that Instant remember where he was..so he went back and let CANELO shut his mouth up for all that BS he was spewing the last few months. CANELO has brought back boxing like Tiger did for golf…you watch, all the young kids that been following him want to be like him…might be great boxing in our future…but for now enjoy it while he’s KING…👊🏻❤️😃
Knock down the big mouths 🥊
And that ladies n gentlemen is how u close the show.. not this hit n not get hit unanimous decision BULLSHIT!!!
Sheeesh he got him with the same shot that he broke billy jo’s face with
I ask you guys saw how in the second time Canelo Savia that his opponent was married and as I danced it, I just marial and kill that style or packiau... saludos desde PUERTO RICO
Pinche pelea cagada
Hope canelo never gets civilized. Cause if or when he does it’ll be it for him.
Otro costal vendido! He fights a bunch of nobody's in a depleted 168.  Boxing fans get jipped with these bs fights, Porter vs Crawford is a real fight not this bs.
Where all the Mexican haters saying KingNelo 🤴 would lose 😂 🤦🏻‍♂️
Everything that is happening in the world was planned a long time ago
Suelo
Name of the song in the background???
Like Mayweather said wants I leave this is the Man! Nobody beats Canelo.
This boxing commentator gets me so hyped, he makes the fights so much more enjoyable 🔥🔥
Did you noticed the announcer kept stopping himself from saying champion of the world he would say undesputed champion pausing and using other words . Cáñelo is a champion of the world.
An Floyd made him look slow.
Saul Canelo Alvarez has hands that crack safes open
Now we know how the Billy Joe Saunders fight would have ended had his orbital not been caved in. Caleb Plant employed the same strategy BJS did, minus the ducking into a broken-eye-socket punch.
King canelo supreme
This was not a championship fight though? Neither are world champs correct? Just trying to get this straight. Thanks.
Humbled!!!
They be letting Boxers take to much punishment  I see to many fights that should’ve been stopped
now canelos gone until may rip
what the song at 1:20 called
Name of song 1:11
King Nelo
Canelo really wanted to knock this man out 🇲🇽
If only maywheather was younger.
What a fight 🔥🥊
Credit to caleb he a good fighter , but Canelo is in another level , he a beast !
The GOAT
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES !! 🥊🇲🇽🦅🐆💯🤙
That man good
Let’s be honest for a guy like Caleb that didn’t fight anyone significant he did great I dare say amazing for his position in this fight so congratulations to canelo for his well deserves win I just wish the competition was better in that division because only Caleb and billy actually fought him tbh but still well deserved places in history I hope one day I can fight him when I get up there
Happy for Canelo however who is that beautiful black woman in the ring with the burgundy jacket that was helping out does anybody know her name I will ask her to marry me
Ruiz is a Canelo hater. He showed no emotions when Canelo was beating Plant.
https://youtu.be/hwWZnAqkxfQ like mike tyson 🔥Canelo P4P King
If you can see Andy Ruiz in the crowd, he’s just chilling lol while everybody else jumps up after both knockdowns
So they not gon let plant get up?? Wtf he was ab to get up tf is this stoppage
Congrats Blake Griffin!
Uppercut inertia
Y Que viva México y que viva el Canelo Álvarez
Bad
Lmao the way Canelo ran after him 😂
BUENO ESE BOXEADOR QUE PERDIO QUEDARA SOLDO POR MUCHO TIEMPO CON ESA TREMENDA PALISA QUE LE DIO POR EL OIDO MIRA ESA PELEA VALE ORO ESE TIPO PENSO QUE LE IBA A DAR UNA.PELA A CANELO Y LE SALIO TREMENDO ALACRAN QUE BUENO ESE TIPO ES UN FANTOCHE SE CREIA  CANELO TU ERES GRANDE  MIS RESPETO PARA TI ERES EL MEJOR  DIOS TE BENDIGA SIEMPRE 🙌🙌🙌🙌👋👋👋👋👋👋❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘
Tbh, plant luckily barely missed the ko from alvarez in the 10th. But canelo made sure it would not go another round.
He fought everybody,  never ducked any fight like other chicken call themselves a goat.... Canelo champion 🏆
Canelo collecting the belts like thanos🤣
that's not a KO, thats a TKO
Pound For Pound 🏆
Great fight from both fighters 🔥
❤❤
Karma struck on plant,called canelo a drug cheat,a mother fucker and he disrespected the Mexican fans. A thing that you should never do but my respects to any n boxer that gets into the ring
Dude canelo sucks. Fighting a bunch of taxi drivers 😂
Why the f would you ruin the ending right in the title??
Eso es ... Viva Mexico cabrones
0:02 That actually sounded like it hurt
SADDEST THING IS THE FACT THAT PPL FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD RESPECTS CANELO, WHILE MEXICANS IN MEXICO HATE THE FACT THAT HE'S SO BIG. THAT'S WHY MEXICO WILL NEVER COME OUT OF THE WHOLE IS IN AS COUNTRY WITH THAT MENTALLY.
Who did the chicken dance now hu hahahhaah
What a Fake champ
like a shark man. Once Canelo smelled blood, he went after plant like Canelo forgot to do the dishes after mom is getting home from work. Man i can’t wait for this man to go to 175🔥🔥🔥
What happened to plant, he had the 10th round he got knocked down got up and second time before he was down he lowered his defense but protected himself canelo never planted any knock out blow, plant evaded the shots reminds me of when de la Hoya just quit mid fight, plant gets up real quick ref don't even count, idk
That was a Joe Frasier Left hook.
1:59 Bottom left is that?
Canelo is a fuckin monster
Floyd mayweather says he will come out of retirement to fight Canelo !!!! 🔥full interview 👇🏽 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntB-or3Xh5
Heard the boxing voice crying about an early stoppage lmao
Why is this being hailed as a huge victory??
Call me crazy but I think Plant could complain about the stoppage.  He got up after the 2nd knockdown but there's little to no chance he would have survived the rest of the round.
He does not know how to cover up when hurt..hes a great fighter but Cinnoman took it !!
https://youtube.com/shorts/hT89TgH6Yro?feature=share
Crazy to me!! Canelo is a beast!!
Clutch
I was here
Pa que respete ese maje canelo is his dad
Caleb really did make this fight look easy. All the Plant Band wagon fans ( really Canelo Haters) where y’all at? You MARKS! Plant let his mouth write a check his A$$ couldn’t cash.💯      So what’s the reason now ? Canelo is P4P or y’all too busy being Unbelievable like Plant. F**k him if he would have won he would be talkin until 2022. He didn’t deserve to be in ring with Canelo. He protected that belt for his biggest payday. All you Plant Fans Quiet now huh? So ….. what’s your excuse, speak up , looks like Plant found out there’s levels that he is not on. N he found out when everybody else did , when it was TOO LATE ⏰ 🤕🥊😵😵‍💫😴
Canelo Alvarez is just amazing to watch... How he just continues to walk Plant down into that 11th round Knockdown and for the KO. Everyone that faces  Canelo has talked a gang of BS to him and he ends up destroying them and taking their belts. They must feel awkward after losing because they now know how GOOD Canelo truly is...
Este compa no esta en la lista de los 10 mejores boxeadores !!! No manen. Por esta razon este guey hace lonque quiere con sus rivales xq no se a topado con boxeadores que esten en los 10 mejores de la lista
3:38 that's a scary dude
This goes to show everyone how great floyd Mayweather really is. His boxing skills ring IQ and very deceptive power makes him the most perfectly trained boxing athlete I have ever seen in my life time. SALUTE TBE FM 🇺🇸🥊👑🥊🇺🇸
Canelo makes ko and exciting fight not boring 12 rounds of dancing and running around like some boxers
Well I'm the only person who's beating Floyd Mayweather in a fight. Remember lil peep gave me orders to rape my neighbors daughter and to kill her every one showed up to my house to try to knock me out Keith Thurman I knocked him out.
Plant did good he will give any of the other guys a run for there money but canelo is just on another level
Plant is slick but Canelo is on a path for history. Just to much momentum behind him to stop.
It took him 11 rounds to get rid of a feather fisted guy with a lot less experience that had fought NO ONE! Yeah, let's put this guy in the Hall. I am amazed at how these promoters work! To sell this as something other than a sparring match and THEN to get idiots to pay for it. Wow!
No-one gonna mention, the lady in the back with her lizard  👁 _o eyes?
Canelo punched his hairline back
First knockdown n he will remember 😂 puro caneloo 🔥
somehow Canelo was ahead on all three scorecards going into that round I just did not see it that way no way boxing is still decided by who brings in the most money and scripted that was a scripted boat especially if they were going to give Canelo decision and easy decision there I thought plant out box them up until that very point that he got knocked out
Wow...what a show
Everything is a F R A U D Donot Be Stupid People  Caleb Acting Like a Child For How Many Millions Of Dollars ??? Canelo Acting And Not Punch In His Face ??? Fútbol And Box Makes Billions Of Dollars And  Only Stupid People Believe In That Amén.
Caleb drop
Anyone know the name of that song playing in the background??
It's all about conditioning stamina and endurance
Mad respect for Caleb to even last 11 rounds. He's a real one
"Plant goes down for the first time in his career, high drama in round 11!!!"  That fight announcer has golden commentary every single fight or interview
That left hook would of broken plants face.. good thing he ducked down…  Canelo ☝️
plant should have stayed down and took his time getting up the first knock down to recover but  his corner dropped the ball
I won't be surprised if canelo decides to squeeze in another fight before the end of the year lol
That left hook before the last knock down would’ve knocked Caleb out cold. He is really lucky he didn’t get hit with that one, great fight. 2 great champs!
0:02 the audience sounded like something out of Wii sports 🤣
mad respect to plant, guy went 11 with canelo, that aint easy, took some big punishment had solid movement but started to crack when he took one to many punches, even after being downed he still had enough energy and awareness to dodge that left hook. good fight.
Remember when he caught Kovalev on them ropes. Dude has crazy power.
Canelo had him wobbling all over the place dam. He told him he going to feel something different and wasn't lying. Viva Mexico🇲🇽
I know Spence wants the Canelo fight but that would be a terrible idea, Canelo is too big and skilled he would probably finish Spence
Does anybody know when will there be a replay of the fight available?
Is Caleb Plant related to Robert???
That tainted meat doing wonders!

Fuackk he rocked his ass!
Made him run back to the corner
WE LOVE WAY TO SEXY PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND!!!!
Who are this oponent of canelo are they realy  boxer
Can anyone name the song that plays mid video? Its the Spanish techno song
Y AHORA K SIGAN LOS NEGROS.
Boy collecting the infinity stones
Next I'm bringing a coat rack to carry all the belts.  In to ring.
I called it man, I won $1,300 at work! Canelo has some Viking/Scandanavian DNA in him, 100%.
Canelo’s little trot at 0:22 has me dying 😂🤣
And still the loss from pretty boy Floyd Mayweather hunts him forever 😂🤣🤕
That was all that counted, " CANELO" ALVAREZ..
It don’t matter how tall you are reach u have it don’t matter trust me also look at my man Canelo
0:45 canelo’s coach is like “cal mate canton”
Le falta pelear con mexicanos  al canelo  asi como Barrera y morales
Why doesn't this guy move up in weight class? This is a joke now. Mayweather is the only blemish on his resume.
People actually thought plant was gonna beat Canelo🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡
This guy lost to mayweather????
I had a fun weekend I saw Eternals early Saturday and then I we had a birthday party for my cousin and then we watch Canel vs Plant. Great time!
My respects to Caleb, he lasted longer than expected
Why his trainer slap him in the back of the head like that? Canelo looked back like who the fuc.... ohhhh it's you coach
Caleb did a lot of talking pre-fight….where he at now? Didn’t even do a post fight interview 🤣
The only fight that matters is the fight for your soul. Jesus died for all our sins but you must repent and believe in him today to inherit eternal life. satan is fighting to keep you focused on things that dont matter. Canelo will be defeated eventually ether by another person or by time itself.  Boxing is all about pride and God resist the proud but gives grace to the humble. We must kill our pride and become humble before God to get into heaven and thats why we need to be born again. Please seek God today with an open Heart before its too late. Canelo dont care about you nor does the other fighter but Jesus cares about you and died for your sins thousands of years ago before you was even born🕊🔥✝️❤🙏
Canelo eres un chingon viva México cabrones
GOAT
And jake paul wants to fight him 🙃
Wikipedia says Canelo is 5'10, the "Tail of the tape" said he's 5'7. Who's right?
In Jesus name This is the content I came up with because my mom's name is Michelle :  I got high to catch my mom moonwalking I try to put her in situations take a step back "I'm about to make Michelle moonwalk" My dad got annoyed at the taurus ♉ jokes & yelled out "in half" He's a Gemini ♊ too My dad saying bullsh*t made me laugh so hard I couldn't hear the rest of his sentence 🤣  Reply "huh" When I found out about Michelle's bicuriousity I changed her name to M.A. in my phone She laughs at the michael references She sent me a Pic of michael Myers with a hand on the hip Head tilting sideways & a knife 🔪 in the other hand caption "me when I'm sick of everyone's sh*t" When the u.s.a. military made more rights for the LGBTQ+ community She started wearing camo attire to celebrate 🍾 🤣 She's still close with the women she kissed Called her the other day She was driving with Carmen in the passenger seat After IPhone I got a Samsung Galaxy bc I know Michelle space jams🤣 In Jesus name amen
Canelo is a beast!
Canelo all the way  🇲🇽🇲🇽 🤜🤜
All these plant fans quiet 😂😂😂😂
Plant tiene 21 victorias contra puros don nadie y le duro 11 rounds al canelo. Eso significa que el canelo vale para pura verga
😂 😂 why won’t he fight charlo or Andrade
Different league
Hahaha that wasn't a knockdown it was a knockout. Plant made a mistake calling the best  Mexican boxer a MF. I don't think I have seen Canelo that heated. Plant couldn't have really thought he would win against the best boxer there is right now.
King 👑
Mexican  Power!  💪🙂
What the hell did Calib beat in the past because he was nothing at all tonight.
What a goat. He was out for blood after that first knockdown
I think Canelo busted his ear drum did you see the blood coming out the ear…
Still can't beat Floyd Mayweather
Id like to see Canelo beat up GGG part 3 at 164 lbs.
Caleb brought him to the deep end. I was rooting for Caleb, and honestly I'm not disappointed.
Viva Mexico cabrones! 😃
Calib didn’t even come close.
“You’re not in my level man”
Man look say what y’all want but Caleb put up a good fight he will be back I’m still a fan of his people acting like he wasn’t out boxing the shit out of canelo congrats to canelo for making history it take a lot to get in that ring and both of them came to leave it in the ring don’t be so hard on plant if you don’t have wat it takes to step in that ring with a beast like canelo
I expected more from Calib. He was less than most of Canelo opponents last 2 years.
Power if steroids!!!  LOL
Hate this stoppage he wasn't that hurt
canelo fight great that was a good fight but people don't forget he lost with money mayweather
Now canelo vs fury

Canelo proved nothing 168 is a trash division! 3 Great White Hope's with absolutely 0 power
Mike Tyson said it best"If you really wanna know what your made of go against a mexican fighter"
Mexican power💪🏼
Aye mr plant you earned my respect ✊ you made me a fan even in the L
THE KING MEXICANO!!!!
VIVAAA LAAA RAZZZAAAAA🤞🏽
Everyone thought plant was gonna win??? Hell no CANELO GOTS POWER THAT NO-ONE CAN COMPARE I THINK NO IN HIS TOP CONDITION AND POWER CAN TAKE OUT MAYWEATHER!!!!
HE TOLD CALEB PLANT.. " YOU GOING TO FEEL SOMETHING DIFFERENT!!!!"
Ahuevooooo
dazn never disappoints
I'm glad they made up about the words Caleb said, but don't bragg if you can't back it up. Canelo is a class fighter for going up to Caleb and talking to him and telling him all the stuff that was said was water under the bridge. I really don't think Caleb will be the same anymore, his ego was out of control, and I'm sure this has humbled him. Benavidez, and Charlo would destroy Caleb. Caleb can't punch. He might have some speed, but you gotta have power. Viva frijoles
CHEATER - Alvarez's positive test for the banned substance clenbuterol that postponed his May 2018 rematch with Gennadiy Golovkin and led to a six-month suspension.
Something ward could never do is become undisputed 😂😂
Respeto para Canelo Álvarez señores.  Viva México cabrones!
Can't beat steroids.
Caleb fought his ass off. I respect the dog in him for doing what only a few will.💯👊
Just chopping wood
Is time to go for mayweather, now, and see!!!
YES WE CANelo 🥊🇲🇽
Hats off to Canelo for boxing well and unifying the 168 lb division.  But Beterbiev would KO him in Round 5 or 6 if he goes back up 175.  He would also lose vs Bivol.
The ginger Mexican strikes again.
Im mexican and the true is canelo is overated is only show like wwE
Another GREAT boxer from Méjico the country that has produced many…….. great bóxers throughout many years.   This young man takes good care of himself and at 31 years of age he has a long career ahead of him.
King Canelo.. He Never Beat TBE .
Plant needs a better trainer... he's a very one-dimensional fighter.
00:25 Plant looked like a baby giraffe trying to gallop away from a lion.
He's good but not Mayweather great.
Turned him into a plant with that shot
That is a real Mexican right there baby!!! What a BEAST!!! VIVA 🇲🇽😍😍💪💪💪 he was no match for Canelo. All he did the hole fight was running.
Boxing is fake those shots are pussy ass shots.  boxing is just a soap opera like wwe
Ni pedos se tiro este.
Canelo said “you’re going to run run run”
Awesome, Canelo is superb & top of being so atractive!
I felt billy jo did better against Canelo.  Bill came to fight and landed some clean shots.  Plant after a few looked like he wanted to survive.
Fake shit all fake
A Glorified Club Fighter! "Caleb" was... Truly out of his league!?
Wish he would have done that to Mayweather
caleb plant is the devin haney of 168, very good fighter
*Andy Ruiz Jr. was watching with a stone-cold face.*
What now? Will people stop hating on Canelo! Will people continue on saying that he bought the fights? Bunch of haters…. ——Brown pride to the BONE——-
A lot of Canelo haters went home disappointed and all salty..now saying Charlo has something Canelo never seen 😂 😂
Yeah he definitely is a BEAST!
Cuando canelo pele con jade paul volveré a ver el boxeo lol
This is what canelo should have done when he fought Floyd
Straight beast
Canelo ain’t fought nobody! His fights are setup!
Boxer wifes are always so awkward
I actually thought plant was doing ok up until he got caught in the 11th man that shoulder roll defense gives canelo fits..he was getting frustrated. lucky for him Mayweather is probably the only one that could do it for 12 rds and make it look  easy
Chingon el. Canelo
One Life to Live   https://youtu.be/FlrZlf50t8c
Shoutout to Caleb bro fought good he was making canelo miss all night. Feel like he was winning the fight the scorecards was just disappointing
I actually felt bad for Plant, after Canelo planted him in the floor, but seems like he shouldn't have done that pre-fight attempt to land a cheap shot part of his repertoire.
Jake Paul would waste this amateur.
Alverez will always be known as the boxer who got schooled by Floyd Mayweather lol
All Hail King Canelo!!!👑🇲🇽
WTF? did they only had two cameras? the best shots weren't even shown clearly.
It just seems to me that C. Plant was not throwing right and moving right.  Maybe it's just that Canelo is just that good and neutralized C. Plant and made him look odd.
Canelo said "no Los puedo ". Meaning he couldn't hold up all the belts. Too much gold 😂
You check all those belts!?!? Bling bling
Dam they posted this quick
Caleb at 0:10. " I'll be back I'm just going to the store"
Muy buen show ,,lastima de pelea
Plant lasted way longer than I expected.
MA-MA MIA CANELO WITH THE OVERHAND BOMB STINGING LIKE SWEET AGAVE NECTAR FROM JALISCO - Mauro, probably
And Marty wants to box this guy 🤣🤣🤣 Couldn't even defend Colby's punches, wtf makes him think he could box Canelo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rematch 11th round fight why not?
Mayweather would come out of retirement and whoop canelos ass again...
I want canelo to fight some Spanish fighters and some black fighters now. The black boxers and the Spanish boxers bring more smoke 💨 to the table. Or maybe Canelo doesn’t want any real smoke 💨?  🤔
I guess plant found out too late
Was he going to get back up or was he done 🤔
All referees wait to long Plant was already out  when he first went down !!  What you seen him do is what all fighters do  after so many years off fighting the Brain memory tells them stand up & say you are ok!
Canelo haters he still hasn’t fought goku.
That's what I'm talking about.
Dammmmmmmm a real life thanos. They need the avengers for boxers to stop him.
Major Respect to plant for going 11 rounds with the pound for pound king
Canelo was landing that left jab from Round 1. Next thing you know, down goes Plant via that left hook.
Plant threw no power shots but Canelo was throwing BOMBS!!!!
What a farce!!! All this fighters that fight canelo fight differently than they ever have… this guy never threw his right hand with conviction and cánelo was there for the taking. This has to do with Mexicans being the main fan base of boxing and if you rip away their star the boxing economy will hurt. Boxing has become WWE and canelo fights are now wrestle mania.
Let's goooooooooooooooo!
Ref  You wanna keep fighting  Caleb Yes. Gets layed down 10 sec later.
Where is was Andre Ward?
Okay, that is a BIG man, going down, w the Heart of a Mountain Lion. Respect to Plant, this is the definition of a "good loss". Not unlike what Saul took against Mayweather. Listen. Caleb said it straight when he said that many of Alvarez's opponents came to lay their belts down. Kovalev and Avni Yildirim to name a few, just came for the payday.
Weakest div in boxing..
Raza stand up!!!!
Canelo taking them belts easily like thanos with them stones.
Do tha stanky leg 🦵
Canelo got the job done baby,  something different!!!
Que chingon es el Canelo!
I have been studying the fight back and Caleb Plant has even more of a chin than I had thought previously.   That first left hook just over his right hand shielding the chin (just a split inch too low allowing it to sneak in, that’s how good Canelo is) would have taken out any other fighter in that moment, flatlined.   For Caleb to fight so well, get up from not only that shot but straight back up after the eventual KO shots + the initial walk down left hook at 0:22, I mean it is extremely impressive on all fronts.   I have no doubts that Caleb Plant (if he wants to which I think he does) can for sure become a two-time world champion.   Thoughts/opinions? Love to discuss!
Early stoppage for sure
I was surprised that Plant made it that far.
Steroids help, what can you say.. you think Alvarez would have a shot at someone like Marvin Hagler.... point made.. that's why boxing ratings are what they are...
canelo threw that left to the body for the whole fight but then BAM. respect to plant. dude showed up to box
See I knew it I told Caleb canelo dangerous lol
Eso es todo canelo eres el mejor
It's so awesome when punches don't land and the guy drops love gambling Vegas...let's go Brandon
P8xmorocan
They should make 1 Super Powers Belt, instead of having 5 or 6 Belts
Cuh need to fight a nigga like Charlos or something he moved up to avoid niggaz like that
Por favor ponganle un boxeador no a uno q va d salida jajaja
Haver cuando le ponen un bien peliador..ya triple g Caleb y esos ya ya chole ponganle algo ya bueno .....
Canelo is THE GOAT!
He had Plant galloping like a horse before the final knockdown! Lmao
King? King of ducking.
Their is no excuses now go fight Benavides let's see if he is going to except or just duck him like he been doing for the past 1 and a half months put his money where his mouth is period!
Prime Canelo >>>>Mayrunaway
Let’s hear it! Waiting for excuses, race cards, what if’s…..
Canelo Álvarez is the ☝️👑
Here is the reason when  Leon Spinks who only had 7 fights beat muhammad ali why cant jake do the same thing with 4 fight and beat canelo
Song name at 1:34?
Bigger and better than Mayweather could ever dream of being. What Saul did in less than a year would have taken Floyd 2 decades to accomplish
You Right buddy-never disappoint .
Looks like Canelo is a gardener, because of how he professional planted his opponent.
Why didn't Caleb hug Conelo? Cant do that anymore? I dont really watch boxing anymore
Impresionante ver como golpea un bulto andante-WOW
Viva Mexico HDSPM
No cap but i think canelo vs jake would be a great fight
Millonsitos de dólares por un tiro
😂👍🏼🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻 YES!!!!!!
It’s such a sight when Canelo smells blood and goes in for the kill.
LMAO
Why didn’t he unify 160lbs
11 rounds is alot of fighting... Gotta respect it..
Tru. King!!
I didn’t get to watch the fight, how many rounds did plant win?
Imagine seeing Canelo running after u in the ring going for the kill..
Canelo had Plant so dazed after he went down that 1st time he jogged to a corner like he got the Knock down....🤣🤣🤣
It actually felt BIZARRE to see Plant on the canvas! 🤯😱🙊
straight folded him
Watch the UFC. It’s much better than this.
Everibody talk like hi , do something amazing ,bro! From far you see that plant haves nothing to beat canelo! Why people so surprised
Bien trabajo Canelo...los gringos no aguantan nada. Si aquí los ayudamos con sus gringitas...
What’s the song in the background???
This is just so funny too me all that shit talking from plant and he gets taken down with a knock out lmao
Camelot ran up on him😭
That place sounds fucking Insane... That crowd.... Canelo is Unbelievable. Caleb Plant, you are good, but you live a Believeable life my man
Jajaja puro mexico noq no nomas dense cuenta q calida de rasa😅😷
That boy got that good juice🤣🤣🤣🤣
Calm and collected. Sticks to the gameplan and slowly picks you apart.
Chills running down my spine
Was talking all that shit got his ass slumped
I'm a huge canelo fan but plant earned my respect after last night he gave 1 hell of a fight I don't take nothing away from him,but no one can fuck with canelo
Yes!!!!!
Epic Fight
Fight david benavidez
yyyyyyeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhh
Haters can shut their mouth now who they going to come out with now no competition 👑
Tired of him fighting white guys
Beast
Que berguenza canelo parece que esta peleando con kawachi puros pinches costales le hechan
Have to watch highlights since I watched ufc instead
Canelo is something else. Much respect for Plant for getting up and keep fighting. Great fight!
Pound for Pound🏆
So much for Andre Wards input ! 🤣
1:59 min Andy Ruiz on the bottom right hand corner - he is wearing a diamond necklace
So when does Jake Paul fight either of these guys?
Canelo is fighting bums , why is he dodging David Benavides?
He moved up from 160 and declared war on every belt holder in the 168 division.. and smashed all of them... One after the other.. impressive
He whipped the shit out dat man🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤤
Great fight from both fighters Caleb was probably the only super middle who came to fight and put up a fight there is nothing to be ashamed of. And big Congratulations to Canelo the only Mexican to became the undisputed unified champion and only to unify at super middleweight
alvarez should call terence crawford..
Canelo becomes the first undisputed Mexican fighter, if he’s not the greatest Mexican fighter of all time you’re stuck in the past 🇲🇽
Usman beats both of their asses in the same night
Canelo is the king of boxing. At this moment, nobody stops him. Canelo beats 95% of the heavyweights in this generation as well, no kidding.
Am a canelo fan but plant put up a challenge on his ass
Shout out to Plant doing his thing. Even though he lost he made the fight competitive and fun to watch. Canelo obviously won. But something should be Said of a man who takes a loss with class and dignity. Dope night for boxing in general.
Canelo fights never disappoint. What a run
Fight should of been over after the first knock down.
Caleb plant voice: u can't hurt a po'boys chin 🤥🤥🤥
Everybody has a plan till they get punched by a mexican
You knew that was gone happen.
HAIL KING CANELO
And jake Paul trying to fight nelo jake would knocked back two weeks before a fight😭😭😭😭
I didn't expect any different
To bad andre thrash bag ward couldn't help him
Canelo alvarez might be able to beat chuck norris
Bravo 👏
The thing about Canelo's greatness currently is that it's not by Mayweathers doing. All this "Mayweather is the greatest" talk is irrelevant at the moment. And the moment belongs to Canelo.
Parents have a TV on their front porch and I was watching the ppv on it last night. My mom was laughing because I tripped the motion sensor to her ring door bell while loosing my mind with excitement in the 11th. She was at a rolling stones concert while watching me thru the ring doorbell. Congrats champ
The thing I love about Canelo lately is when he says he’s going to knock you out he delivers. Best not to get the king upset. Arriba la Raza 🇲🇽
Oh fuck did you see all his belts! Lol that's insane! This man is the best modern day boxer.
He still a Cheat
I’m knocking him but I wonder was he juiced??? He took a lot of punishment and wasn’t even budged???also with the wbc allowing a higher level of that steroid that then guys from his camp had in their system is that fair???
Jajajajaja este está igual que el boricua mucho alarde y poco habanse
Canelo has too much experience over plant
Canelos fights are the best to watch, great warrior just like Tyson, Chavez Sr, Ali and Pacquiao. Each one of these boxers would give all their effort in actually exchange punches not just jab and run around the ring.
Hey if your eye socket is not broken, then that’s a win for me. No shame Caleb.
Truly a great fighter
After he completes all his fights he out🙏🏾
Sabia que no nos iba a decepcionar el # 1 CANELO EL MEJOR 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️😘😍🥰
Canelo is unstoppable!
Floyd Mayweather still whooped that ass 🤷🏾‍♂️
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
Why The Refereee stopped the Fight HE DIDNT WAITED FOR PLANT TO GET UP FOR 3RD KNOCKOUT HE JUST RULED HIM OUT WTF
Happy birthday and congratulations Eddy Reynoso 👏👏
plant was scared the whole fight,He wouldn't even engage  Canelo when Canelo was on the ropes.
Imagine the fear inside of Plant when Canelo started chasing him down
Damn fight went just like Tony harrison vs. Charlo how u hang in there and get careless at the end smh!Know this dude can only fight 1 way and that's come forward.
Pepas song 🎵 🎶  💓💞
No mamen con un  rozon de nariz lo nokeo
The weakest division in boxing
Now you know you don’t say “ MothaFucka” to Canelo😂🤣
Why didn't he do that to Mayweather?
Mane beating all the white Boys up😂😂
Let’s be honest we all knew this was coming
I know it was great but the part I liked the most was that first hook on the first knock out that hook had mike Tyson written all over.
BUT HE DID NOT SAY HE WILL DESTROY CANELO?..maybe he is eager for a "second" madriza
O Respect for plant. Talked shit said he was gonna win an he didnt. Great win for canelo. Plant is a nobody. No big wins. Canelo beat better fights. GGG, lara, cotto, jacobs, those guy went the distance. Even billy joe. Plant got that ass planted.
Boxing is so boring now
@1:31 left side 🤣🤣🤣
It's funny how some people say how is it possible that Nelo's power carries so far into the fight he must be on roids. However when the script flips the say he is an unathletic inactive fighter that barely throws. Like his number one haters Derrick James and the Ward boys hahaha.
Canelo ducking the top contenders
King 🤴 👑 Canelo!!!! Greatness!!!!!!!
Canelo 💪🔥🔥
Some told me that this fight was fixed. Forget it. After seeing the fight; Canelo knocked him out cleanly. I don't know what fight they were watching. Canelo is a great fighter. There's nothing fake about this boxer. Unfortunately and sadly; he will go down like everyone else. Someone will always come around who's going to be hungrier than him. History has shown us that there's always someone better. Unless he retires undefeated, but if he continues he will be beat.
Floyd would still beat him
Que buena actuación 🎭😂😂😂😂
Got to give props to Caleb for keeping it together for a little after that knock down
How you just let yoself get beat up bro never put his hands up
Canelo es la mera ver,,,,,ga
Same ol cranking left hooks from Canelo. Literally Canelo walked up to Plant in slow motion and cranked a left hook lol. Kudos to Canelo but these dudes are no where near Floyd’s skill level. Shows you how talented Mayweather was for shutting all that shit down.
Notice how he pushed him into that uppercut damn that was viscous
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES 💪🏼
Canelo 🐐
Still can't beat Mayweather 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️😭
early stop
Canelo looks unnaturally huge. Amazing how much muscle he has put on over the years.
CANELO IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE BOXERS EVER. HIS STYLE OF BOXING IS THE ULTIMATE TREAT FOR A BOXING FAN. HE PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON HIS OPPONENT WITH THE RELENTLESS STALKING AND WHEN HE HITS YOU CAN SEE THE POWER IN HIS PUNCHES AND HIS CHIN IS SOLID AS IRON. I THINK HE'S THE BEST EVER AT THAT 160 TO 170 RANGE!
MAYWEATHER VS CANELO 2, FLOYD LOSES BY KO IN THE 12 ROUND🎤
Calebs ear drum was bleeding, seems Canelo ruptured his ear drum 00:55 😮
Quote who s the bitcccch now vato
Mexico is on top the face of boxing for another Decade yessir 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Fake as wrestling 😂
🪴 what happened to the fireworks you promise…HAHAH!!! Canelo said you ain’t on his level king of boxing doesn’t lie…🇲🇽💪🏽👊🏼🥊
Music at 2:25 anyone???
Good fight until Caleb plant remembered he was supposed to take a dive  looked shady at the end punches didn't appear to land very hard looked like he gave up more so than was knocked out
The Greatest of our Generation! Bravo! Classic! No One in any weight class can mess with him
Eres una vergüenza para el boxeo
The only reason Caleb looked good was cuz of Canelo being desperate for the knockout before round 8 like he wanted. If anyone noticed around round 8-9 Eddie told Canelo to stop being desperate and to stick to the gameplan. Fast forward to round 11…KO. I think it could’ve ended much earlier if Canelo wasn’t being so sloppy throughout.
Anyone know what song was playing in Spanish after Canelo won?
My boy saul fucked ‘‘em up
Nothing to be ashamed of plant fought well but Canelo wears u down hopefully we get the fight we know everyone wants to c  and it would be a war Canelo vs Benevidez
CANELO ALVAREZ just wanted to Cut this guy head OFF......... Caleb Plant was swallowing his own words and disrespect for Canelo on his way DOWN to the mat, CANELO ALVAREZ THE KING!!!  SHOW RESPECT FOR THE KING, Lil Caleb!!
Hell yeah
His kids are so lucky. They could probably take his place when they get older and start in the ring
Good that they stopped it. Saved plant from himself, his ear was bleeding.
Casual Fan: Plant to fast for Canelo easy ko.  Canelos Elite Record: Watch closely son
Canelo fought like it was a personal fight,glad he whoop the pride out of this guy.
Planet said I must run away to my people
Thought canelo was scottish.
TERRENCE CRAWFORD IS KNOCKING OUT SHAWN 🏈 PORTER 🤕🤯💥🥊"NEXT" RIGHT IN FRONT OF KENNY PORTER🤕🤯💥🤛🏽 CUZ KENNY PORTER STINX AS A TRAINOR, HE WILL NEVER, EVER‼️
nobody notice how canelo ran up on plant right after the knock down lol
Solo con nenas pelea canelo
Left hook started chicken danse
I love it.  Talking ALLLLLLLLLLLL that spice/ Talking ALLLLLLLLL that trash 🗑 🤣 convincing himself that he's a vet,he knows what to do to beat Canelo, that he's the best 👌 👍  that he's better; blah,blah,blah. If you knew boxing, Canelo etc etc why?WHY IN GOD'S NAME. Would you go in there 🤔 thinking that you can beat Canelo with a jab. Knowing you jab is NOT even close to top 20 best jabs in the game 😤 use your jab yes/utilize your jab, yes! But for a Beast like Canelo 👍 👌 you are going to need WAYYYYY more than that.  You are going to need your whole entire arson & some. I swear 🤬 to me this fight really made NO sense/ zero!  He literally ran 🏃‍♂️ tried to run in hope's that he could avoid 😂 the punishment/ KO but could not.  Could not avoid any longer and got KO 😴  Don't get me wrong. I hope he is ok 👍   he tried but ; I knew 😔 I just knew he had nothing for Canelo.  Nothing!
2min remaining plant could have keep Fighting 😆 🤣 NO MAMES...
I SAW CALEB PLANT "WIFE" BLOWING KISSES😘AT CANELO RIGHT AT THE KNOCK OUT... WOW‼️ SHE DONT LOVE PLANT, SHE LOVES A REAL FIGHTER... SHE WANTS A LATINO BROTHER💥💪🏽
Canelo has been much better after he lost to Floyd, Floyd was much better after he lost to Castillo, great fighters learn from their defeats.
He was cheating😂sports enhancements helloooo Stupid
Best thing seeing plants legs betray him 😂
There is no one left for Canelo to fight he might have to retire LMAO
I knew canelo was going to whip that boy behind,with vengeance all that talk he was doing, canelo took out a can of whopass just for  him .........
Is like having mike Tyson's at his prime again!! Amazing
How the fuck does Canelo have so many haters, until recently dude didn't even speak English. Dude is 56-1-2 doesn't duck anybody and he knocked out a Light heavyweight. Mayweather would never.
Canelo fan here , never talked shit about plant he a great fighter hope you good champ
CANELO is just the best!!! Mayweather got away thanks to the judges. Canelo should be UNDEAFEATED!!!
We all knew this was coming.
caleb wanted to be Mayweather style but only one can master it and that's floyd
Did he win by knock out
When ur getting hit with " sledgehammer's" & ur returning with "sweet hands " ........it's not gonna end well. But prop's to CP, for taking it to the 11rd
mfs really saying this shit is rigged 🤦‍♂️
Canelo won but Caleb was a male of males and he wanted to keep fighting 🔥
plant wasn’t no match for canelo 😂😂
This was sent to the the gulag, the heavens  he beat the shit out of him.
that shoulder roll eventually gets you in trouble
1:58 Andy Ruiz in crowd. To the right of Caleb.
Plant: flashy, jab with the pitty pat  Canelo: focused, determined, patience with a TKO.  I really feel like Canelo played with him too long. Broke him down like a car in a junkyard.
Man, great fight. Mexican fighters rarely disappoint. Win or lose they give fans their money’s worth.
Canelo stealing belts out here but some how ducking fighters too? How is this even a theory?
Even without the TKO, do the Canelo haters really think Plant would have won on the scorecards retreating throwing that weak flicking jab off Canelo's gloves.
Buena actuación de Plant.....se merece un Oscar.  ....😎👍......🤣😂🤣😂
La segunda Acadia es un fraude 2 golpes a los guantes y un golpe al cuello y el ulimo golpe resbalo en el cuello despus se deja caer el ribal Miren en Camara lenta grasias
Mayweather beat his a$$ Manny never did Manny never wanted to even fight him.
Canelo 🇲🇽 ran out of room for 🏆 belts👏
Wow Canelo be looking like Mike Tyson and Joe Frazier when he landed that left hook at 1:26 . Plant vs Canelo was a  great fight!
That Mexican was juicy up 💉🥩 since Floyd and erislandy lara fight!! That Mexican needs to stop running from demetrius andrade
Truth is Caleb Plant show us he can stay moving and fighting that by itself  is not easy. Also plant was pretty dam good up there took canelo 11 rounds to tire him out. It only goes to show that even thoe canelo is better Plant was not as easy as we all thought.  Good plant and Felicidades to el tapatio.
Cáñelo knock his hairline off
In order to be considerd 168 king he would have to beat David Benavidez
The fact that Plant thought he was on Canelos level was crazy he knocked him the fuck out!!! Gave him that Caleb Plant bobblehead!!!! KING CANELO!! AND DAM HIS WIFE IS SMOKING HOT
canelo vs jake paul next..make it happen showtime..that is what the fans want to see.
Anybody looking for a trainer I'm your guy
Canelo is just a monster I don't see him losing anytime soon. Fighting Mayweather and GGG make him for the best
💯..... Legendary
You can't win a fight against a seasoned Champion with just a jab. Yes you can build up points and even win rounds but can you make all 12 rounds? That's the million dollar question.  Gotta take more chances and set up the power shots to cause some damage. Either that or you better have some heat on that jab. Not enough against Canela to have a quick jab. You have to have a missile like jab. A mind numbing Jab that causes damage to the eyes, nose, ears, the whole face.  Caleb should focused on a stronger Jab and not so much a fast one. It was like shooting bb's at a freight train. I think Caleb is an excellent fighter. Just need to work seriously on punching power. He does that and he'll go far.
Esas peleas del canelo no convencen a los verdaderos aficionados y conocedores del arte de la fistiana no puede ser que cuando en un momento que estuvo el canelo en las cuerdas el plant no le tiro ningún golpe le estaba dando pelea y de un momento a otro se le acabó el gas y lo golpearon como costal de papas a mi pobre criterio es un rey en tierra de tuertos
History in the making I swear         https://youtu.be/pUBteFAMntI
Canelo did a speed run in 168 on hard mode.
Plants a shitter
Actually a good match....       https://youtu.be/pUBteFAMntI
I’m so happy for Canelo and his team. Now that they’re on top, what’s next? Will he amaze us again or come crashing down?
Where are my Canelo haters.  Hiding under a rock.
is ginger a gringo?
Estuvo bien para que se le kitara lo pendejo por encargo mentando la madre ala jente antes de todo le dieron en su madre sela regreso el canelo  jajajaaj
What separates CLENELO from the rest is he likes to cut corners all you people talking about his work ethic y'all have short memory spans he was caught and suspended for using PEDS that's just a fact there's no erasing that. I was a huge fan of Clenelo until the failed drug screening. I love boxing to my core it's part of my soul but real recognize real his legacy is tarnished from his history with CLENBUTEROL. And save the tainted me story don't lie to yourself
you wanna fight? yeah 2 secs later....
jaja plant was skipping and running.jajaja.hop skip and a jump
Is nobody gonna talk about how the knockout wasn’t an uppercut?
Canelo Alvarez is so Pumped full of Steroids all of his wins should be nullified and he should be Kicked out of boxing for Life
Two bad asses....Great entertainment!
Plant is weak.
You can run but you can not hide canelo will get you
Jake paul will not last long with canelo  Alvarez
Did Plant hurt his foot or was he just getting beat tf up? His limping around like somethings broke
It's nothing like seeing it live ioe I did 👍🏾👌🏾. Great fight!!!!
You don’t talk about boxers moms and get away with it lmao
I’ve watched this like 10 times today.
Good on him! We all knew it was gonna happen...
Where im from i dont fuck around neither
0:45 I like ya cut g 👋🤣🤣🤣
Canelo is god. With Red hair
😀😀😀😀😀Como le hace eso a GGG?😀😀😀🙈
Plant went out on his shield
Goosebumps all over the physique
Now, we can call Caleb Plant "sweet feet."
It’s feels amazing to be Mexican at this moment in time and have a once in a life time Champion like Canelo.
We’re all the haters at
We’re lucky to see Canelo in his prime and making history. Without a doubt he is the best P4p king. 👑🇲🇽
2:25  canelo made huge mistake  that cold have him costed a hit.  Caleb did not use that opportunity to his advantage.
I hate how the ref didn’t even give him a chance to get up but fury gets 1000 counts when his eyes are closed and snoring
Canelo always rock solid!!  Always a class act and never acts like a douche bag.  He deserves all the respect!  God bless you Canelo
The initial shot was a textbook Joe Frazier left-hook.
Andy Ruiz is like “I knew it” in the back 😂
Canelo beats prime Floyd
Still didn’t look spectacular especially for someone who eats so many Mexican cows
Another taxi driver to the list
Congrats to Canelo, but I still think he needs to have a solid win against GGG.    GGG won that 1st fight, the 2nd could of went either way.
Always had respect for Pewdiepie but after hanging in there with Canelo to the 11th round I am now a fan and looking forward to his next fight. Well done pewds
LOVE CANELO 🤴 👑 and his accomplishments as a boxer and family man  👪 much respect 🙏  also this fight made me respect Caleb Plant 💯 takes a lot of balls to get in the ring with a killer like Canelo 👍
The KING. 4 fights, 4 wins, 11 months. History. Viva MEXICO 🇲🇽
Floyd still🐐50-0

Did you see el pan panbon que le mentioned eddy a canelo at the end
Love it great fighter
Rigged as hell🤦🏾‍♂️fake boxing 🥊
Fuck I wish canelo and tank were closer in size!
Like a lion who was stalking his prey until he knew it was time, any doubters now can eat a di#k!

WHERE ARE ALL THE CALEB PLANT FANS AT??? ALL THAT SHIT TALKING YOU DID.....CRICKETS
But yet supposedly mayweather and Andre ward had given plant the blueprint to beat Canelo LMAO!!!
Semos chinjones canelo viva mexico cabrones
Look like a mike Tyson punch
Unbeatable
Canelo best fighter ‼️‼️‼️
Crazy uppercut you say looked more like a straight right 🤔
All Canelo haters: " he  ducking Benavidez, Charlo, Tyson Fury, Goku, Frieza,  Mike Tyson and Jesus"
Simply put Canelo is a humble beast! TBE
Canelo:I told ju gana see. I promage ju madaphucker
This looks fake lol
Planted his ass
What a boring fight.
Plant looked like he was boxing exactly like Amir Khan the whole fight. Nothing new for Canelo  Great fight!!
plant was copying floyd syle lol
Canelo is everything. But Caleb showed up and did his best. What a dangerous game. But the triple G fights it still feels like canelo should have a loss on his record but this is Vegas hahah respects to both fighters
MayWeather
i love caneloo
Canelo coach smacks him in the head 😫😂
Canelo is on GOAT level! And dude's in his prime🙏🏽
Canelo can’t be beat, bums like PooPoo Andrade, Chumplo & Benevidez would get smoked by the p4p king. None of them even have a decent name on the resume but wanna fight Canelo? lmfao.
Give credit to Canelos conditioning. He walks you down lands target punches and still uses head movement effectively.
He needs to fight ggg again
What is the song called after the match
u can see the fear in Caleb's eyes after being ask if he wanted to fight and watched Canelos blood thirsty eyes charging at him full speed.  Classic
""A su esquina!!""  " tú no pen-dejo"
That’s how you count? 5,6,7,8? What happened to 1,2,3,4? Lol 😂
You got knocked the fkkkk out 💪
Nobody ready for prime Canelo
Respect to Caleb he went at it and made Canelo work for it and he went longer than I expect it and definitely held his own. VIVA MEXICO!
Plant just has to develop a little bit more power and he’ll be on top of the division when Canelo moves up great fight from both! 💯💯💯
This just goes to show you that Mayweather wasn't shit! Just a clown and con artist that bamboozled the World
Bro every title belt at 148 ? Damn
the crowd reacting together over canelos replay was pure bliss
When will canelo fight a real fight
Waiting for full fight highlights!! Thanks.
Esposo guntes del caneko son muy diferentes
Lock Victor Conte back up! And  oust his spaghetti ass out of 🥊 Boxing
@02 you can hear the punch 😳
Plant it’s just smoke and talking trash ,not big deal for canelo I think plant was the easier one on canelo carriers
Another staged fight, plant threw 3 punches after round 1 lolllll
Circo maroma y teatro
I feel bad for Caleb
ALL roads lead to Canelo NOW! 4 belts unbelievable!
Ppl be getting me with that, Plant was winning some round and So....He got his ass KO'd. Was He Tryna Win the Fight or Win SOME Rounds, lol Too Funny. Good KO Canelo💯💯
Victor Conte that baldheaded meatball needs a Beatdown for putting Canelo in harm's way
Dude didn't had no chance with canelo SMH all that trash talking for nothing
Regardless I think Caleb did a good job compared to how bad the majority thought he would
fight should’ve been over the minute Plant first got up and wobbled his way to his corner. he was obviously on shaky legs already
Canelo moved up to this weight in order to avoid the good fighters in his previous weight division. Now he can weed through all these unheard of fighters and cashout! Chicken shit!
This is when "passion and heart" defeats "all-talk".  Want proof?  Plant's apology for insults after the fight and Canelo still took the high road saying "it's ok"
And the New Medical inpatient 🤕🤪🥴🚑🚒 🏢 Caleb Plant!..
how he developed in the last years … he is in the path of becoming one of the best fighters!
The real challenge is finding a way to Hold all the belts for the after fight photo?
Plant gave canelo more trouble than Saunders did, Canelo looked frustrated at times and couldn't really land the right hand to the head  Also the translator at the end didn't say everything canelo did and skipped a bunch of things but canelo checked him at the end lol
Canelo knocked the black out of Plant 😆🤣😂👍
That was a replica of Mike Tyson. Very nice
Daaaaaamn
hope he continues refuses  to give African  Americans  a chance to fight him  they mock the sport and only interested in money ..canelo loves the sport money comes second  to him ..plz continue don't give them a chance canelo
Plant should've tied him up
It's crazy how everybody is undefeated till they fight with lions ...
Thank you kodi 18.9

So good... Love it.  I'm glad he beat the hell out of plant because plant is a brag.
Canelo doing a leonidas scream during his last fight  auuu auuu!
Canelos is the best he's smart great fighter strong and he can take a hard punch. He's just the best pound for pound in boxing today viva México. Salud con un buen Tequila 🥂🍾🥊🥊🦅
Andre Ward- You still out there? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Only thing Caleb Plant did right was come out with Conway The Machine.
The first mexican undisputed in the 4 belt era
Kudos to both fighters
Is it me or did it seem kinda staged ? Like plant just gave up that round and threw the fight 🤔🤔🤔
Boy Caleb ran to the corner as if the round was over 😂
Salute to Caleb. But it’s just Canelo’s time. 👑
Canelo Alvarez: Undisputed Super Middleweight Champion  #1 Boxer in the World  #1 Trending on YouTube   Bravo Mr. Canelo.
Canelo vs charlo please!!!
Still couldn't beat Mayweather 🤷🏾‍♂️
Caleb started off really good
Caleb put an amazing fight. Canelo! Let’s go champ’
Caleb shot his load, should be satisfied with his performance but Canelo would keep coming, climaxed with the money shot his uppercut, leaving Caleb jizzed on the canvas
Love Canelo, dude puts in work in the ring.
All that Trash 🗑️ talk . Got his Azz beat bye the Mexican boxer.
De la hoya punching the air right now.
When that leaping gazelle punch landed Caleb was Planted
Salty black dudes just keep holding onto that Mayweather loss. Keeps them from not having a panic attack at night,
INCREDIBLE fight
#Canelo
I’m still want to see a fight Canelo vs GGG or the runner chicken of Mayweather
The best!
Still got dominated by Mayweather
Canelo 🐐
El papa de los pollitos... Saul Canelo Alvarez
A Que Boxeador Han Visto Corriendo En El 11
Would he run away from David Benavidez  ? 🤔
You know Caleb "sweet cheeks" is hurting this mornin...
Rematchhh Great fight
Eso es Como pegarle a alguien borracho asco de peleas
Canelo will never be Chavez or Juan Manuel Marquez. He's just not that type of legend. They fought the who's who. Canelo is know to fight the who the hell was that???? Not a legend homie
Canelo is like Mike Tyson…relentless attacker.
Peleas arregladas
GGG is better
I’d say he’s in the top 5 greatest fighters ever if not the top 3
Who misses DAZN highlights! Way better than showtimes
He’s the best Mexican fighter ever and the best middleweight and super middleweight ever
What this fight taught me was that Tyson Fury is the pound for Pound best boxer in boxing!
ALV 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌
Nobody: How many belts do you want?  Canelo: Yes
bro chased him like a bull VIVA MEXICO CABRONES
This is how Canelo makes you pay for disrespecting him. You will be forever in his K.O. reel!!
UNNNnnn Soldado en cada hijo de Dios ! ! !  Viva México Cabrones ! ! 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Damn it was lit AF there.
Guess they don’t teach you that in Tennessee
hes the best only because GGG is to old to fight??
I expected this outcome. Another tomato can out the way. Every time Saul wins Floyd Mayweather stock goes up. Crawford vs Canelo that is the fight I would like to see. Crawford would have gain weight and move up in weight. Let's make it happen.
Plant surprised me. I didn’t expect his defense to last him that long nor did I expect the striking stats to be so close (Canelo destroyed him in body shot stats and damage ofc)   117 v 101
Hail King steroids 🤔
Caleb needs to beat Charlo and Benavidez then get that rematch with Canelo. In the mean time Canelo should do a catch weight with Bivol or Beterbiev.
When the referee said you want to fight? I should’ve said NO 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
A lot of people are talking about how Plant did really good, naw man keep it real we all had him getting KOd early. He lasted longer but I personally feel like he didn’t do any better than the other 168 pounders.
Great fight.
Canelo cheated
How embarrassing for a boxer to be down like that 😳 it must hunt them forever this moments. Even tough they r sportsman and this is part of the fighting game , a defeat like this will be such embarrassing that is why most boxers retire after goin down like this
00:22....00:26 and they said Canelo didn't know how to cut the ring 🏃‍♂️🥊🏃‍♂️🤣😂🤣
imagine if canelos weight has always been in 168. he would of smoked plant like dust... crazy how canelo started at 138lbs
Canelo and Loma are my top 2
I tip my hat to Caleb,  kept strong throughout the fight and came back and apologized to Canelo after the fight, it takes a big man to do that, best wishes to you Caleb,God bless
👍👍👍🇲🇽🇲🇽
“All hail king canelo” “viva Mexico” goosebumps witnessed history last night
Canelo is carrying now 6 belts right?
All hail Canelo.
Aye plant gave a fucking fight though. Fought till he couldn’t fight. Gave it his all. Now canelo is just different. I hope plant trains dumb harder and trains to hit like a truck and let’s get that rematch.   Congrats to canelo.   Congrats to plant. Hope he holds his head up. He’s gonna get somewhere from this loss.

I knew he was going to win, the only reason Mayweather won is because he never stopped running
I WANNA TURN THIS INTO A MAYWEATHER CONVO SO BAD.... GREAT WORK CANELO....YOU EARN THE BELTS AND THE HOF BOXING STATUS!
The King did it,  Viva Mexico Cabrones
Mexican thanos Fr #vivamexico
Left hand fucked his whole night up
Canelo knocked a mud hole in his ass then stumped that mud hole dry
Nobody can say shit about that 11th round. That first knockdown was so clean. That big left and then that right uppercut. Omg put him in his ass.
Plant.... uprooted!
When he won  my older siblings went crazy
outdid floyd
💪🏽mad respect for caled plant💪🏽👊🏽
Great fight it was no land slide like every one thought plant would of went 10 more rounds happed just like i thought he got tired and lost defence its hard to keep your head geting hit by mini freight trains
This dude is a hard puncher. The last lost he had was floyd Mayweather 2013. Top notch fighter.. Who should he fight next??
Canelo goat status
Canelo wanted everyone to get their money’s worth. When that 11th round hit he was ready to end it and he did just that, with ease! Fury and Wilder then Canelo and Plant, just what the world needed after what seemed like endless social media and Jake Paul fights. Very refreshing
The little punch the trainer gave canelo 😂
Idk why anyone thought Plant was gonna give Canelo a fight. Trash...Paper champ just looking for a payday. Got bitch slapped a few weeks ago and was mentally done after that.
Canelo, YES SIR !
Canelo is not a volume puncher... he throws a less punches... but puts everything behind them :)
#1NO TERNDING
@ 45 sec., most these new kids be concussed lol...
Canelo put him down like a gentleman.
Any word from Andre Ward yet?
Gotta give Caleb the credit he didn’t wanna give up and that’s nada but respect ✊ he did his best to fight a boxing god
All the shit he was talking about canelo... those with big mouth always fall
He won but not by land slide
Referee " put your hands up, wanna fight? "  Plant" yeah" runs away from canelo after 😂🤣🤣😂🤣
Caleb Plant with all his trash talk was forced to eat it all. He was totally outclassed
He's not fighting any one he could win.
Early stoppage.
Yo Keith thurman is this that American style you're talkin bout...
I called this
Why is Canelo Avoiding other Star Boxers ??? Errol Spence, Charlo, Crawford, Benivedez, Ward, Andrade, ect ??
And to think a UFC fighter thinks he’s going to give this guy a challenge.  Lol
Im sit it here feeling emotional man. Same feeling how  your brother canelo start it. love you lil brother caleb you can do this! Bye my friend
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽 long live the king CANELO 👑
Hey man Caleb plant just got a new fan, he showed heart instead of fear and he put it out there and gave canelo a tough time, it was a great fight respect for both 👍🏼
Yes, Canelo is the greatest, but a lot of his shots hit Plant in the back ( the back, not the side), which was red from those blows. Is that legal?
The way canelo chased after him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 had to watch it again like 10 times
He brain said continue body said nahhhh lol
Canelo no convence todavía le falta enfrentarse con boxeadores Buenos como lo fue un barrera vs Márquez Márquez vs Manny Pacquiao en muchos más no con costales de papas a nosotros los conocedores de box no nos da atole con el dedo aya quien se lo crea.
Good stop by the ref this guy is a young fighter still has a long way to go good boxer great fight👍👍
If, you didn't know Canelo was going to win...Y'all are lames. Cenelo is a pure beast...A TRUE boxer. Offensive, defense and beautiful counter puncher! When he gave Plant a 2 piece pollo slap during the faceoff...Plant was done with already Lol
Congratz champ.! The best fighter right now Canelo! Love from 🇵🇭..
I keep giving out the perfect recipe on beating Canelo but nobody listened'
Plant is garbage. All he did was run an play defense. Plant didn’t want to continue
Great fight and a great display of boxing at its finest. Lots of skill sets on display from both fighters from offense to defense.
Peleo bien caleb, pero canelo es un maestro en el arte del boxeo☺️ saludos desde PR al campeón ✌🏻
Well he woulda had that KO earlier not sure what rd he missed that power right clean across Plants face...but all the Plant fans all sad now 🤣🤣
Canelo should get into MMA and make history in the UFC
Neever forget canelo is always on clenbuterol! , WBC raised clenbuterol levels so he can test as high as he wants too DONT believe me look it up ⬆️ Canelo will never be great just like Jon jones . YOU CANT CHEAT AND CALL YOURSELF THE KING 🤴
That mayweather  hiding move chicken shit didn’t work this time
You can't beat  Canelo  if all you do is run and not exchange punches in the pocket
Clenelo Alvaroids 💪
Fixed fight
2:34 what is the name of the music in the background ?
Plant now looks like just a clown 🤡🤡🤡🤡 🤣🤣🤣🤣     Viva MEXIICOOOO ❤️❤️❤️       VIVA CANELO 😎 PTOOSSSSS
Benavidez will beat canelo he gets touched way to much
The best boxer of this era, hands down. if you cant recognize greatness at this point, your just a miserable hater.
Hey LDBC! Suck on that!
I hope that shit wasn’t rigged…
Sup haters!
I’m not a canelo fan but that left hook that started it off was beautiful
Always for canelo, but I think the ref should of let plant have a shot at getting up again after the 2nd knock down that shit was too quick man to call it tko
The announcers stopped talking to enjoy history!
Awesome 👏
Caleb did not make one adjustment in that fight.  He kept just ducking to his right.  Easy work for Canelo.
ALL HAIL KING CANELO!!! VIVA MEJICO CABRONES!!
Lmfao!! Plant definitely felt something special!!!😁👍
wow !!  what a fight of 🇲🇽🇺🇸of 2 greats !!!  but!!  I win the best alive 🇲🇽
Many may disagree but I believe GGG should be canelo next fight if GGG wins his next fight
Nice boxing contest. Canelo is literally second best to Floyd. Still a great contest though.
Friendly reminder that GGG was robbed in the first bout with Canelo
Either way canelo lost that fight against triple g so there should’ve been a third sum bitch ass boxing judges.
Canelo es un super canpeon muy duro para su estatura es un gigante en cuerpo pequeño felicidades canpeon bendiciones para ti y tu familia a Dios gritar tu trunfo
No shame in Plants performance, he went out there on faught his ass off, and respect for both fighters squashing their beef. #P4Pkingnelo
I think Billy Joe and plant should fight
Boseadores piratas
Eddy Reynosos hit canelo harder at the end of the fight than plant ever did. Canelo almost got knocked out
Peleas arregladas para aser ricos a los ricos
He looked out when canelo landed that hook his legs were gone. It even looks like canelo held him up
To think that some ppl had a even match on paper and some had plant winning the fight 🤣🤣 TF outta here with that BS haters 😆
Madrina la que le dio iuuuu mexico 🇲🇽
undisputed my ass ggg beat his ass and mexican boxing judges felt sorry lol
Canelo looking like Tom Brady with all those belts
Did you guys see Charlo in the background...he wasn't too pleased hahah
Love you son
I bet he will never say anything about Canelo's mom ever again.  Too bad when you are knocked out, you don't feel the pain immediately, but next day...ooouch go back to the couch🤣🤣🤣🤣🖖
Roid boy is a classless athlete. Just following the script. Roid boy.
You can just see the difference when someone punches canelo vs when he punches them. Canelo is the top 5 in the best striking power ever. King canelo
Landed bricks to body and soul!
Haters give up. Canelo IS UNBEATABLE RIGHT NOW!!
Great job by Canelo. He never showed fear and went for it every time!
Canelo mayweather 2 I think he's ready
Would love to see fighters actually fight
The way Canelo RAN up to him to finish him off 🔥🔥🔥

Even tho caleb lost....I wanna see his next fight
Mike Tyson predicted the result of the fight.
What a competitive fight man. Canelo is a late bloomer but the Knockout was gonna come one way or another haha, but massive respects for Plant for lasting as long as he did. He had a great poker face and looked solid, until he wasn’t haha 🔥
no more dazn? showtime paying big money again
All the haters are now saying charlo is the boogeyman lol 😆  you really will never satisfy everyone, dude just made history in an epic manner but yet hes never good enough smh 🤦
0:19 Mike Tyson on the top left seeing everything
So who should Canelo fight next that will give him a challenge
Crazy how good mayweather is wild
Would love to see one of the Paul brothers get smashed by canelo.
Plant didn’t know how to recover properly. He never been hurt before and never experienced going against high level opposition. Experience of Canelo really showed
Otro costal mas .
That got to be one of the worst feelings in the world. Being dropped while thousands are cheering it on
This fight has a fix stink!
Run it back I can't wait to see canelo loose
Canelo got lucky ! Ask him he k own it .
Yeah plant talked a lot of shit but don’t we all he deserves respect and he won me as a fan he’s a hell of a defensive fights never opened up the left side of his body can’t wait to see him fight again
Jaa no manches  lo nokeo o se  dejó caer???
Yea crazy uppercut that didn’t mean shit people talking outta their ass again . Did plant win though? No his lame ass still got knocked out as if that was a surprise
the best ever next time shhhhhhhhhh
Respect to both I have to admit that Caleb strategy in protecting the body (which really help plant to not get KO earlier )
Time to fight Usman now.
Now he's definitely a top 5 boxer in all of the sports history, if not higher.
Lol
Canelo was like a pitbull going for the finish 💪💪💪
Juicer
After Round 10 I was Scared Caleb will be badly Hurt, hope his Okay. 🙏🏿
Plant was running like some round up hit him.
Canelo won, that's all I needed to know.
People think it was too early in Plant's career for this fight, but I thought it was too early in Canelo's career for Mayweather. Look at him now.
Jake Paul will ko canelo .
Orale
Canelo was relentless
I find the most intriguing thing of these fights is seeing the America cast system.  America men have little respect for minority of Hispanic/ latino heritage.  Other then the minority they sleep with there is a general cast system wear they show no respect for minorities especially Hispanic/ latino once.
Ready knew it was gonna happen
plant got planted 😂
Aquí está demostrado que los mexicanos somos umildes
I have showtime on YouTube TV and I couldn't figure out how to purchase the fight: (
Solo puedo decir, VIVA MEXICO!!! 🇲🇽
Honestly Canelo should retire. Who the hell is next?
I knew Canelo Was gone win But still nigga on the Roids
That’s what happens when you talk shit!!!!
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Camelot is the embodiment of what you when you lose. The best thing to ever happen to Camelot was the sparring session he gave Mayweather. He took Mayweather’s adjustments, and added it to his own style.   However, I do think if he fights a slick fighter, he would be beat. Plant tried to be that slick fighter, but slick is more that footwork. He was moving and frustrating Camelot, but he wasn’t giving meaningful shots back. Camelot had no respect for getting hit by him.
King Canelo rag doll's face plant.  You could see this one comming.  🤣🥶🥳🙈💪🤜💣💯
Wow! 🔥💯🎆🔥 Canelo &  Fury  👑 2021. 🎉🎊🍻🥃

Don't be mad Plant i was there when Canelo got his lesson and he has knocked everyone out since including you.
Canelo fights NEVER disappoint.
Canello fought very angry and was quite successful with it.
Canelo the White fighter Assassin
BUD CRAWFORD VS CANELO ASAP💯😱💣
Man.. plant felt those shots.. plant tried to duck them he couldn’t do it.. he did his best! Respect to plant.
What's the music in the beginning 1:34
I don't believe in boxing anymore I'm happy Canelo is making 💰💰💰💰
The drug cheat won, would have never guessed…
I too thought Plant was going to be destroyed but he surprise everyone with his pure boxing ability and IQ. You could see in rounds 9 and 10 canelo was a little taken back by Plant's ability to outbox him in certain instances. Canelo was annoyed for sure but finally hit the mark in the 11th. Im definitely going to keep an eye out for Plant moving forward. He has great boxing ability. If he had a little more pop in his punches he probably could have won this fight tbh.
That man should have been given a chance to get up but I get it
ALL HAIL KING CANELOOOOOOOOOO👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑 VIVA LA RAZA👑🐐
I did not watch the fight in hope that Canelo would lose, but due to Caleb's defensive skills and pugilistic abilities, I wanted to see how the styles would clash. There was a point where I thought Ali-Frazier; however, I knew that Caleb lacked power and that jabs and straights round after round would not suffice for the scorecards. I wanted Plant to survive the turbulence, since he had boxed so well up until then. Canelo chopped him down, landing the left hook that worked all night for him and meeting Plant's face as it descended into Canelo's uppercut. If Plant could have gotten up again, it would have been more of the same.
La humildad sigela llevandola en el ❤ mi hidolo quitate esa corona que sabes ke la mereses y la portas pero en el ❤ no empieses con payasadas como el resto...
I want to see him fight Charlo, bivol, benavedez
Incredible fight 🇲🇽
Plant got a new fan what a great fight
Bruhh canelo ahh basically is thanos of boxing 😭
Canelo and his corner knew exactly what they were doing. Anyone who thought plants lame  ass ever had a chance to win is purely just talking outta their ass
10 million dollars
Canelo was losing the fight 7 rounds to 3 on his favor if he doesn’t ko plant the fight should of been for plant
Hello Caleb now you know the Mexican power.  Even maybe 10 fighters from Mexico can send you to see some stars
‘i told you so’... this guy
Can someone please translate this into Spanish for Canelo “ Stop being a pussy and fight somebody worth fighting everyone knows you’re going to beat these English European Caucasian scrubs! I see you continue to run from the Charlo boys! Cahones pues!”
Idk man, he was getting up on that second knock down. When it comes to the fighting game, anything can happen, but they completely called it off after the 2nd knock down. Imagine if that had happened during the wilder vs fury 3 when fury was dropped twice in the same round. I like canelo but this wasn't a real knock out, Caleb was definitely rocked but not ko'd
I heard Plant was selling chopped ribs today at some place in TN lol In others words He's good and hard for Canelo to catch him up Or maybe Canelo let him live for at least 4 extra rounds
Those left hooks by Canelo were deadly during the whole fight
He needs to fight Lara and Mayweather onces again to be proclaimed the 👑 of boxing otherwise he’s still not.
✌🏾🙏🏾🐜Also Did AnyOne Catch Sir Alvarez Eat Some Kind Of Substance While He Was Getting Announced By Sir Jimmy Lennon Jr✌🏾🙏🏾✌🏾
Does anyone know the name of the song that played after he won
All these Pbc fighters ain't gonna fight canelo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Time to fight Artur Beterbiev!..
Canelo is on a different stratosphere. They will start saying venavides, Charlo. And they will be good fights but canelo is above them too.
Please stop comparing the Dull brothers to this real Mexican warrior champion.
Respect for plant he was tougher than I thought great fight
I wanna see him fight a charlo
Fireball. Man is cinnamon flavored death.
That left was viscous 💥🥊game ovr
Tyson son can knockout canelo
0:44 bro like “ I like ya cut g “
People gotta start using the Philly Shell on Canelo, Caleb just doesn’t have the power to give it to Canelo. If Canelo fights someone with good power and uses a Philly it’s gonna be tough
0:45 😭😭 Eddie smacking him
Holy shit!!!!!!!! Canelo is a monster
That shoulder roll got hurt from those hooks that canelo through at it. It weakened his jab so that’s why he didn’t throw it as much anymore. Canelo hit anything and everything to hurt it and put it out of use…!
Holy bull shut yo🤣😂
Y’all blind as hell canelo isn’t fight too fighters  he didn’t beat ggg in that first fight he was outboxed by erislamdy Lara he couldn’t Knox out Miguel cotto fight should have been a draw
Hail king CANELO!!!!
Ontara ese boxeador puerto risueño que le dijo a canelo que perdía ontas cuñao
Canelo can KO both Charlos in one night.
Mucho canelo as demostrado ha esas vivoras que te an estado Atacando que te enfrentas ha puros costales ha  ver que disen oy
What a nightmare having Canelo chase you down in the ring...
Big respect to Plant, lasted longer than what we all expectd but Canelos just cleaned the whole divison in 11 months, four fights! Mama there goes that man!
CANELO WIFE IS A MAN.  THESE MASONS R WEIRD
Plants a good fighter but you have to have power in order to take down a great Mexican fighter. If not, Ull be skipping to my Lou like plant was.
"I will show you something special."  Canelo Alvarez
CANELO WIFE IS A FKN MAN.
I still think the referee shouldn't stop the fight so quickly.  He should have counted to 10 first.
Un costal como el Junior  chavez  otro más  oh oh my god
313 canelo is a joke period
Whos next …. Canelos haters can keep on hating. VIVA MEXICO CABRONES 🇲🇽
Now time to stop fighting couch potatoes and actually be great  Fight Beterbiev no catchweight bs
Camelot is a beast, idk why They want to have this fight the same night as the best UFC card of the year though. I would of liked to watch both live, but I wasn’t missing that UFC card . Re runs of Canelo will have to do
They have babied Canelo's career since day 1. Either fighting cats with no name or champions wayy past their prime. I've was a fan of canelo when he 1st came on the scene walking down fighters like Mike Tyson ! But once he gained a Lil stardom opponents have been very carefully chosen .
Why didn't he give him a chance to get up? He rolled over and was trying to get up why did the ref just call it?
Canelo is the Thanos of boxing right now! 👀
Fight of the year most definitely!
There’s just levels to boxing
Otra  vez no comio chile piquen este bruto sino  si le gana al canelo jijiji jiji
Cleaning up every division !!!! Lol
Joe Frazier left hook
Canelo is just different bro what can I say. This man finds a way to bring his opponent on the ground 👑🙌🏽
Increíble !!! Viva México!!!!
Plant, tell Jordan the Canelo team is waiting for that Gluck Gluck 3000
Caleb should have taken a knee after the first left hook.  He could have survived the round if he did--because he took the the left hook well, but by not taking the knee, the followup uppercuts on top and later bombardment without a rest in the corner did too much damage.  His coaching is not good enough to prepare for such moments imo.  Pride of fighters don't want to allow the knockdown, but ya gotta to have any chance of recovery with big punchers.  That's trainer failure
Bring Ward back offer him 50 million.
LOL   Snore /  Snooze...  Are any real boxing Fans fooled by this Set Up ?   The just keep hand-picking  taller slower guys for Canelo to fight to make him look good,  while they  steer clear of the  Fast Smart Super Middles,  with a style that would be a challenge.     Sorry -   I'm a long time boxing Fan,  I want to like Canelo,   but all I see is set ups,  one after the other.   If Canelo had to fight all comers,  with Fair Judges -  and if he was not on Steroids',    he wouldn't be on Top...
Ref mora doesn’t count again these days
Mucho canelo tu fuiste mucho major que plant Erik morales nesesita lentes por que Dijo que LA pelea Abia estado pareja lla no be
I wish canelo would beat me up and pay me $10 mil lol
Looks like ima have to get team canelo tattoo lmfao
Early stoppage.
Where are all the angry black guys at? 🤫
Canelo no sirves puro bulto te ponen .... Nunca seras nadie ni ídolo para nosotros los mexicanos .... Como mi idolo Chávez nunca nadie va a ser cómo el.... Me caes mal canelo y yo si deseo que pierdas
Where was he walking to when he got up lol.Did he think the bell rang and he was walking to his corner.
This was a joke.  Plant is not a ch as championship boxer.  He has no power.  This was a freeby for Canelo, who could of finished Plant in first rnd. This was deception to fans.  Canelo continues to face nobody's in the sporr
Easy work for Canelo when Mayweather isn't around 😎
respect to plant👊🏼
He aint talking shit nowThats a bad Mexican!
I find great comfort in knowing once all of you FAN BOYS and LIARS are gone and forgotten, that boxing historians will talk about the 2 losses to Golovkin.
Because Plant went down for the first time in his career, he made the mistake of getting up too quickly. It looked like Canelo was toying with Plant the entire fight, Plant didn't seem committed to throwing power punches even though Canelo was walking him down the entire fight. I don't know if Plants defense was great or if Canelo was merely focusing on getting the knockout, I thought Plant did a great job SELLING the fight but clearly, Canelo was the better fighter.  People claiming Canelos success is due to steroids ignore Canelo's skills. Canelo is even undersized at 154 and so far people aren't frequently hitting him clean, even if you took away a prime Mike Tysons power, what made him great as an undersized champion was how hard it was to hit him, when you can't hit someone clean and they're walking you down, looking to knock you out, it can be terrifying, if you don't have the SKILLS nor the confidence to do anything about it! Plant looked scared to sit down on his punches because he knew a counter was coming. If you're going to fight someone you think is cheating, or who cheated make sure you have the skills to do something about it! Although I'm not a fan of Canelo's last few fights, he's now done something that puts him in a special category! Not only is he the current king of Boxing he's undisputed at 168! It's not Canelos fault Caleb was beating everyone at 168, if you're mad be mad your favorite fighters choose money over belts and making history!
Canelo with this win passes Chavez as the best Mexican Boxer in history.
Canelo Alvarez 🐩walked Caleb Plant for 11 rounds.
Caleb plant got my respect
Wow, what an exciting fight. Great stuff! I jumped out of my seat when that happened.
A great time for my Raza 🇲🇽 running boxing
“There’s levels to this”
Like I said. He is to strong right now..his body shots literally destroy opponents. The only small possibility of a challenge would be Spence, if he was to go up
My respects to Plant, hes a monster also and did a very good job but theres no stoppin canelo, i mean like timothy bradley said “ he walked down GGG” the boogeyman of boxing, great performance by plant tho!
It goes back to what canelo said about Garcia can be said about plant focus too much on theatrics not the sport as a whole if some of the young boxers had at least 10% of canelo work ethnic and seriousness towards the sport these young cats can adapt
Caleb WHO...🥴
A la madre estubo  chingona
Anyone notice how much Plant was holding on to Canelos arms??? 🤔🤔
I have a feeling that this is a turning point for Plant's career just like Canelo after the Mayweather clinic. Plant is only going to get better in my opinion, he needs stronger punches though.
He's getting better now that he's heavier...waoo...
It’s the QUIET ONES you always have to watch out for. Never fails. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Puro negosio.  Nimodo
You could see from the beginning caleb was relying on the jab, it really was his only threat, but after the 6th 7th rd, you coukd see Canelo put that pressure on him and began landing good shots and the rest is history
Still wish he would’ve gotten the rematch to mayweather because he learned a lot after that loss and the tie against GGG.
What’s the song in the background on min 2:18?
Caleb proved he ain't no class b fighter... canelo was just better. RESPECT to Caleb for putting up a good fight against the best. Waaaay better than Saunders for sure!
👑🇲🇽many people only saw this to hope to see Canelo loose but he not near a lose
Props to plant a lot of people didn’t think he would go this far but he never backed down and was game till the end gained a fan
Andy Ruiz in the back not reacting at all to the first knockdown has me dying lol. Why was he so stoic
Viva 🇲🇽 Mexico cabrones!!!!!!#who’s next
Whats the name of the song at the end at 1:16
Eso es todo canelo! Arriba MEXICO 🇲🇽 🤴🏻
I wish more fighters are as  hungry as canelo when going belt hunting to unify but everyone is proud of their 1 belt
Canelo is a beast no doubt he was going to win but I can't even disrespect Caleb though he showed some great heart and thought he actually did really good
Stopped the  fight to early
Perfect left hook.
Plant needed 10 more fights to be on canelo level it was too early he should of stick with espn fighters
I still wonder how any of you thought   Plant could beat Canelo smh
The cost of having his hands low left hook to the face
Mexican power for all you haters. All hail king Canelo!
Plant= noob
Canelo!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best fighter of this generation....Canelos ONLY weak spot is his inability to cut off the ring. If he would master that he would end these fights in 4 or 5 rounds....
Una oportunidad para decirte que eres el mejor… Gracis por compartir tu éxito con todos nosotros los latinos…
Plant was running like a scared little bi*ch😂😂😂😂 All that talk for what!?? He got taught a big lesson in shut the fukk up! 😂😂😂
The key for canelo was steroids, avoiding drug test and having a opponent with no punching power.
hayyyyyyyyyy yaaaaayayayayayayaya yaaaaaaaaa yaaaayyyyyyyy VIVVVAAAAAAAA LAAAA MEJIKOOOOOOOO
Why you aint do that too MONEY MAYWEATHER 😂
Wheres all da canelo haters??? Everyone knows canelo is a different monster. Too much hate in their blood to admit it.  We Brooklyn kats support Canelo.  Canelo is the Mexican tyson.  Tell Mayweather to  give canelo a rematch.  He likes money so much
Hahahaha yeeees that what he gets for talking crap!!
👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"You will feel something different " -Canelo
Canelo the freakin beast. Viva Mexico!!!
But still couldn’t get Mayweather… the GOAT!!!
Ez dub
Wow 2 easy
No se porque nunca me convense el canelo pelea con el q quiere no el q le toca
Hell yeah viva Mexico 🇲🇽
1st Undisputed champion that’s a lie Floyd Mayweather whipped his ass
mayweather can really CA$H in if he fights canelo again.....CANELO has to move up in weight. there is no one else.
The greatest ever!
Respects to Canelo, I’m not Mexican but hats off to this champ, Viva Mexico! My Mexican friends must be so proud!!! ✊🏼🥊🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 he’s a champion not just for Mexico but for the whole Latino/Hispanic community! #TeamCanelo
Plant went down like a G tho!!!! Good job canelo!
Eddy Reynoso smacked em harder more then plant 😭😭😭😭😭
And just like that plant career is over.
Es más creíble el perro Aguayo vs.superporky
this gives me chills man Saul Alvarez is supreme
All hail King Canleo 👑🥊 the Undisputed champion of the universe
Plant wanted it but confidence ain't enough.  He was too damn loud to begin with.  Press conference is where he got exposed.  The loudest in the room ALWAYS the weakest.
Ke manera de callarle la voca canelo
What an awesome bout. Respect to both fighters
Props to Plant he knew he couldn't continue but still put faith in himself too keep going. Canelo is King of boxing I honestly believe this canelo would beat prime Floyd
SOMEONE OWES ME 10gs TIME TO GO COLLECT OR I MAY HAVE TO PULL A CANELO ON THEIR ASS !   E A S Y   M O N E Y  !
🇲🇽 🤴
Caleb looked like mayweather at one point. That's when Canelo struggle was real. He couldn't connect Caleb and he was getting desperate. At this point his corner told him to focus and think, to stop getting impatient and to use his brain. Caleb stuck to a jab but lost his defense and grew tired. Both warriors but as a Mexican I agree with Canelo!  Que viva México cavrones!
We all have to admit Plant delivered more than we all expected. Huge respect to him for the great fight and great sportsmanship and for showing he's a warrior. Congratulations to Canelo for the well deserved win!
Plant just threw jabs smh he’s 6-1 he should be like mike Tyson and be a beast not all soft. Mayweather took canelo Álvarez to school in their fight. Wasn’t impressed at all real talk
Long live the mexican king
Him at the end on the ropes. That was a fierce gesture.
I notice canelo push him but should not push
Canelo is unreal and one of the greats and Plant realistically had no chance to win this. However, I cannot help but feel too much respect is given to him compared to GGG who many, including myself, feel won their first encounter and arguably the rematch as well. Again, Canelo is an incredible fighter but the greatest of his era? I suppose from a business perspective Canelo was and is more profitable rather than a 37 year old on his way to retirement but it certainly leaves a bitter taste that boxing can be unfair and dare it be said even corrupt.
All that hype to get ko😳🤣
Plant vs charlo . Charlo move up
Not gon lie canelo a beast but plant did good he was even making canelo miss
Canelo got his revenge on the shoulder roll u could tell it was frustrating him
Canelo was stalking him since round 1, I knew he was in his bag to punish this guy.
Canelo just showed someone out there he has almost 0 technique this is why Floyd beat him easily. Anyone with a good defense or decent power would KO him out easily. Re-watch the plant fight how exposed he was. He's not taking his opponent seriously that could be the beginning of the end remember manny pacquiao when he did this?
Like saunders said canelo got holes one is he not fluid look at the Thomas  Hearns Roberto Duran fight and tell me a peak Hearns couldn't have ko canelo
CANELOOOOO! ....VIVA MEXICOOOOOOOO! CA.................NES!
Yo quiero saber  la opinión de julio jr chavez nomas
Canelo the Red death took him out. His family has to be very proud
Keep talking keep talking we Mexicans don’t use our mouth to talk we talk with out fist 👊🏽
Puro pinche Mexico 🇲🇽 Let’s go king 👑 Canelo 💯💪🏽
I thought Caleb plant was going to “show us” November 6!?!? 🤣 GET HUMBLED!!! There’s levels to this!!
Exciting ending 👍
He can’t beat may weather
Boxers should just use the mayweather shoulder roll defense on him … he was straight discombobulated with that strategy from mayweather
HE KNOCKED TF OUT👌🏽☺️
What's up with the trainer slapping Canelo on the back of the head?
What Mike Tyson said
never make canelo angry viva mexicooo !!!! LOL
cmon easy fight too easy no gringo could beat canelo man
Wish he was this great against Mayweather
I paid $20 got the 11th round and won the $240 pot 🇲🇽 💯 🤴
Camelot Alvarez is a force to be reckoned with. Don't underestimate his boxing prowess. If you want to challenge him bring it. All fighters welcome.
Lol yes fighting scrubby ass fighters!!!! It’s obvious he’s gonna win!!! DUH there are no good fighters left over, mayweather and GGG were the only good ones. Embarrassing
I was watching the fight with my mother in law and various family members and I could see all of them getting antsy because they were entering the 11th round and Plant was still standing. My wife was like “ the guy looks like he’s doing more than Canelo”…i replied “ yeah he’s on the move because he knows that one punch can end the fight, all he’s doing is blocking them body shots well and throwing punches in bunches but it’s not enough, all Canelo has to do is land a punch and he’ll do it in this round”…i was right. Canelo is too strong. He has freaky power, natural power that you cant train for. Youre either born a puncher or not.. plain and simple. Benavidez is the only guy that might be able to bang toe to toe with Alvarez.
Canelo is on steroids. I don’t see how the boxing commission is letting him fight. I guarantee he was dirty for this fight.
It was a great fight respect for both .... canelo great win... who you guys think is next for canelo?
I will like to see him against Benavidez
I told you
This seemed staged if I ever saw a fake fight..I knew canelo was gonna win but I didnt know they paid for the win...
Canelo cuanto pagaste para ganal la pelea so sucio
Canelo convinced me he is the best PFP
That boy Caleb can BOX he will be a threat
GGG took his ass both fights!!!
on his way to cementing his place among the greatest boxers of all time.
Caleb: whaa happen, did I win?
Any athlete whos been penalized for steroids or such, is not a champion to me regardless how long ago their penalties were. Canelo isn’t great. Keep in mind I don’t rock with either canelo or plant so no bias
That’s what he gets for talking about his mom..
Of all the fights we've watched in the last few  years this one was one of the best.  Real boxers doing it for real.
Canelo would miss that punch with chicken Floyd. He moved and used that shoulder to not get hit.
I hope to see Canelo square off with El Zurdo Ramírez his a great fighter who deserves an opportunity. Props to Caleb he did his best against Canelo…
When Fury was out cold where was this officials.
Caleb gave a great effort but was so disciplined to defense he wasn't aggressive enough offensively when opportunities were there early. Canelo power & experience was too much in the late rounds.
one day website infrastructure development under consideration
Celeb Plant wasn't even on the top ten pound for pound list Canelo a coward but want the all time record
Dude this guy is literally unstoppable once he hit his prime theres been no ones prime like his
I am a Canelo fan and became a Caleb fan too. If Caleb couldve kept the same intent and plan as the first round, couldve been interesting.
History!!! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I wish Canelo had a 3rd shot at Mayweather
What makes a great fight? Not a one sided dominance, it's great effort from both fighters. Caleb was great but Canelo was just greater!!
These boxing dudes weak as fuck😂 step in the octagon 👏🏼
Just imagine fighting canelo and seeing him hunt you down like this 0:25
When plant felt canelos power did what everyone Al's  duck  Same as last victim lol
Makes me sad people were still booing plant after the fight
Worst fight ever!!!
Caleb is a great fighter my respects. But at the end of the day brute force a skill wins the fight.
And Jake Paul wants to fight this dude? Yea ok! 😂🤣
VIVA MEXICO CABROOOONÉESSS 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I'm glad Canelo stopped him, because nobody can say Caleb was robbed🤣🤣 Seeing the haters had Caleb winning until he got caught 🙄😅
Mayweather who?
In 10 months Canelo just gave three elite and undefeated fighters their first loss.
ALVAREZ
I don’t think it can be denied that to this day Mayweather and Glolovkin were canelos hardest fights and they made canelo what he is today and all round great fighter this was Caleb plants mayweather/Golovkin so to speak and he will learn from this. Once canelo retires or moves up a division Caleb Plant easily dominates the super middleweight any divisions below thanks to both of these guys for this fight history made!🇲🇽
Best fighter on the Planet! Best Coach !  We just witness greatness and history!!!!  Congratulations Team Canelo!!!!!!
That boy did all that running for this fight for no reason
Ay esta claro q los frijoles pueden más q las hamburgers 😂😂😂😂😂
Plant did better than I thought he would. I actually had plant winning the first 5 rounds due to Canelo not being busy enough, and when he did let his hands go, he hit gloves, shoulders, and elbows. After the 5th it was all Canelo though. Those body shots early on really slowed plant down.
Keep talking that shit  canelo the real deal
I really love this kid! Bam!
King canelo !!! King of kings!! Viva Mexico
Plant was setting himself up getting on the ropes to much what he think he Floyd or what
omg i love canelo!
To be honest I would’ve liked to see that ref let Caleb get up one more time just to get dropped again lmao
Hey canelo try doing that to ggg you know you lost both fights and the whole world wants the third fight but you alvarez.
🥱 and another one. I’ve correctly predicted the winner of every boxing fight for the last 10yrs. This is boxing for you. Who paid to watch this? 🤣😂 y’all the real reason this is boxing
F Canelo drug cheat
Couldnt beat  mayweather never faced him.the second time and never faced pacman
Damn, I really wanted Plant to win this. But goddamn did he go out like the champ that he is. Hats off to Canelo for an awesome performance as well.
EL DESPERTAR DE LA MEXICAN BESTIA,, CANELOSQUI ÁLVAREZ,,
nobody else finna talk about how the crowd was on point singing to Future😂
Now it’s my turn to get that ass canelo
The corner people wearing face diapers was too bizarre for words
Canelo hits you with really bad intentions. Wow salute Champ 🏆
Canelo could move up in weight and fight Usyk and people still won’t give him credit lol
Lol all the whites were talking all that shit
Grande canelo  Vivaaaaaa Mexicooooo 🇲🇽
The greatest of all time.
Shell up, roll and run.. that describes Plants style against Canelo
TKO was the only way he was gonna win
Ward is the best super middleweight ever. BUT, he could come back right now and really prove it to everyone who disagrees with me. That would be dope
I would have a 40 cal. in my trunks.  You can’t stop him any other way, but Canelo vs Charlo = Barn Burner.
Where was this guy official when Fury was knocked down the first time
Damn, Canelo had Mike Tyson up on his feet. That says a lot
No match for Canelo, good job carnal!!!
CONGRATULATIONS MEXICO 🇲🇽 THE BEST BOXING 🥊 FOOD 🍱 AND 🏖 BEACHES. FROM SPAIN 🇪🇸.
Canelo can't beat this guy........     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE9PP7FA6cY
Booom!!!  Keep infuriating Canelo and this is what happens...
Mad respects to Caleb he faught like a true warrior against a monsters.
Why Canelo looking like a mini-Mike Tyson out there! DEM punches RUTHLESS!
BEASTNELO!
Some people saying ref should've let plant get up again. They really want to see a body...
Hagler and now Canelo.  You might as well bring a shotgun in the ring.  He still has Charlo and the other dude with the dreads.  I would make one of them fight GGG first.
Undisputed! Canelo made his own history!  He is the greatest boxer to ever do it!
Canelo is now officially better de mayweather! Canelo is undisputed something mayweather couldn’t do because he would cherry pick!
cayó como costal de papas 🥔
Canelo is Plant’s Mayweather. He can take the lesson and go on to become great. VIVA MEXICO!!
Dang! What's next for Canelo?? GGG won the first fight but sadly G would probably get a Unanimous loss now!! Ginger is in his Super Sayan mode en route to Ultra Instinct......
Plant should've took more time before getting up.... tried to not totally go down and really wasnt ready to get up yet
Te bieras desquitado de todo lo que te a echo ese infeliz
The one thing I hate is not being able to see them Dazn  highlights right after the fight
Jaja vieron los golpes eso fue porte de su mana q ese la ofendio
Legendary Fighter king Canelo Alvarez
How much longer until canelo looses that power? What tools will he use when his power is gone. Plant was outboxing him but canelos power made the big difference.
Pound for pound, the best fighter in the world....he has beaten a whose who of boxing. He cannot be denied.
U wanna fight? Yes …. glack 🔥🇲🇽
Can someone remind me what A.Ward said
Yea boy lol.canelo 100%
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
11 rounds to knock down a nobody ? And they didn’t do the 10 count? Mad respect to Caleb! Boy has a future
He is the apex boxer....fights all the big names without fear....
Don't talk about his momma.
To beat Canelo you must be super tough and high boxing skills
Haha I have to say canelo just doesn’t look like someone I want to win, fuck he does it tho
Hats off to plant for lasting that long in the ring with canelo
I am southern born from Alabama so I will have to stick with my southern culture and stick with the man from the south... Canelo is a little further south so I held true I am sticking with Canelo because he is a little further south than all of us... I am so happy for Canelo... If anyone deserves this win he does...
Forgot to bet for the match was so hyped to watch it ........
Bravo ganó los cintos más fáciles de la historia😎 es un orgullo.
And to think...Floyd wiped his ass with Canelo.
After canelo fight Charlo and David if he's Victorious he should retire if he can't get Andre Ward fight.  He have absolutely nothing else to prove he's still young and in good health and have enough fights under his belt he started pro very early he was 15 years old. Hang them up and enjoy your life champion
Puro tronco l Ponen .. hoy en día el box e igual q otros deportes está corrupto peleas arregladas ha rraza ...
Ref: You wanna fight !? Plant: Yeah! ..and, where 'am' I ?
Let’s go Canelo, it’s time to do the trilogy with GGG.
like all boxers in the end they almost kiss the hole, and thank him for the 10 million
Imagine if canelo would have landed that hook
Imagine going from faces the face of boxing then ending up in the ground and the face of boxing is celebrating In the matter of seconds
Me: Siri, whos got the best boxer? Siri: Mexico
This looks so stage, is corny
Canelo is a baaaaad man 🥊
Cuando escoges boxeadores que no tienen mucho nombre o estan fuera de ranking sabes que te las apuntas facil.Pierde con Floyd,le regalan un empate con GGG y le regalan una victoria sobre GGG,nunca vas a convencer a los fanaticos verdaderos del boxeo.Campeon de carton.
Fantastic showing from Canelo Alvarez. I would be scared if Canelo was hunting me down like that at 00:22
Levels #Undisputed 👑
Congrats Canelo undisputed champion !
PINCHE CANELO DID IT AGAIN VIVA MEXICO CABRONES 🇲🇽🔥‼️‼️
That same left hook he got smacked with at the media event
Eddie reynoso is a genius!!! Canelo wasn’t landing that left flush, so Eddie said rip that right and he started attacking that left said of his body and made him drop his hands and got that KO. There’s a reason he’s the trainer of the yr.
👏👏👏
Canelo is on STEROIDS!
Lo sabia que se iva coronar como él Rey del mundo unifcado es un orgullo para todos los latinoamericanos y en especial su pais México viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Lol im sure no one is surpised of the outcome canelo was the heavy favoritr you had to risk 800 to win 100😂
716 Canelo haters so far 😭
He’s the best I’ve ever seen to hide the roids
CANELO VS. PLANT II....for sure 👍
Fixed  Plant took a dive  Alvaroids in another fake fight
Floyd mayweather said Canelo was nothing if he trys fighting him right now Canelo will beat tf out of I have a ton of respect for mayweather but don't fuck with the king
Hype beast meets reality 🤦‍♂️
3:36
Caleno’s work ethic is what separates himself from others, even other great fighters. “ I don’t go to the gym to train, I go to get better” Canelo Alverez…
Yes sir this is how Mexicans fight
Viva México ..viva los Estados Unidos..tenemos al mejor boxxeador del mundo
Floyd ran with the sport so Canleo could later glide with it.
11 Months…. Undisputed. Enough Said
Canelo is a beast, but majority of his fights where against chumps, and boxers pass there prime.
SAUL Good job defending his belt here comes DAVIS that will be the fight
Caleb plant can box tho they gave a very entertaining fight
I bet Canelo was sweating clenbuterol during and after this fight . Never saw a more proud cheater ...
Jesus Christ is the ONLY TRUE KING! this is all temporary don't get caught up in the hype. Our time is short.
And, with all due respect, Canelo has also got the most beautiful wife in boxing / MMA history, to my knowledge
Really wanted Caleb to win that one
Andy Ruiz is so calm and chill in his seat during the knock down.
I want to know how many times Caleb plant grabbed and held canelo's left hand it's got to be some kind of record
Ahora quien sigue😄😄? Enpiensen a buscar otro maleta para que canelo se siga llenando los bolsillos de millones de dolares a costillas de todos los que pagan los ppv oh llendo las   las arenas para ir a veer.  Mientras ustedes tiran su dinero ala basura, el se ase mas millonario y presumiendo sus casas, sus autos y todos sus lujos 😄😄. Este guey es puro show y habla como si el Mundo estuviera rodeado nadamas de el.
And Jake Paul said canelo next 😹
LATINO POWER! WE DOMINATE SPORTS!
I'm glad plant got put down. He was so disrespectful and was all  attitude. Anyone can dish the heat but can you take it.
Canelo the truth man he is the baddest man in boxing PERIOD! Rules supreme ! Damn! That boy king! Latinos stand the fuck up!!
Everyone knew Caleb would lose tho lol
One great thing about canelo is that he is fighting opponents in their prime and beating them... this is what the sport of boxing is about..
I think the only one who can beat canelo is jake paul🤔
A great example of when "good" meets "great". Everything Caleb did tonight was good, but Canelo is great! Awesome fight!!
Canelo "tainted meat" will forever have an "*" next  to his name. He was given gift decisions against Lara, Trout and GGG.  Canelo refused to give Trout and Lara a rematch. Prior to fighting Plant Canelo fans were saying Plant is a nobody. Now, the same fans are acting like this is  Canelo's greatest accomplishment.
"You wanna fight?"  "Yeah" Said with attitude as though he shouldn't even be asking  *turns back to opponent*
Showtime be better, the uppercut knocked him down, definitely finished by not an uppercut.
Where all the haters talking all that 💩????? 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗.. EXACTLY stop hating 🤡z..
Early stoppage
Greatest p4p alive, no question about it. Definitely the most powerful p4p ever to grace the ring
I’ve never been a huge canelo fan but whether you love him or hate him you can’t deny that he really is the best boxer right now and probably will be for a long time
Listos para los chingadazos gone wrong Eazy Work
To the floor 🤷‍♂️
simply canelo is doing what do best  fight  and win!!
King of kings
Viva King 👑 🥊Canelo Mexico
Why would showtime schedule this fight same time as ufc 268 with some of the best fights all year
Legend 💪🏾💪🏾
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Como mexicano me das vergüenza canelo
Now every can stfu about Terence Crawford. He’s NO WHERE near Canelos skill
I love Canelos composure
Caleb will best Benavidez. Stop hyping David up. Props the Plant.
I've called it many times before the fight. Plant would keep his head wide open keeping his left glove down doing that Philly shell even under fire.
I feel bad for Caleb Plant
A thing of beauty! Canelo El Rey! 👑
Canelo wasted his time fighting this idiot 👑
That count was illegal, he was standing up, he should’ve grabbed his gloves and asking want to continue fighting?
This fight was over once Plant felt the first solid punch from Canelo. Canelo's power was way too much to handle for Plant.
Floyd can get it at 160 😁✌🏼.congrats canelo 🥊🇲🇽
It’s the drugs!
Now get off the Clenbuterol and fight Triple G. 🤪
Canelo vs beterbiev  in may!!!! I think it would be a WAR
😂
Hey, Canelo was already a Legendary Fighter ….. Now ….. He IS a frikkin LEGEND !!! That NEVER goes away !! What a CHAMP !!!
Canelo going down as top 10 ever … but never forget how foolish Floyd made him look !
He forgot to the say "of the world!!!" SMH
So much for Andres advices to plant..and shoulder roll....
Rematch triple G🔥
Where the plant fans at tho 👀
Canelo the GOAT, Plant definitely put on a hell of a fight 💪🏻
Canelo is a boxer not a fighter, And The difference is,  (he thinks.)
Floyd was older than most of the fighters y'all say he wouldn't fight in their prime, find another excuse because that one has been debunked.
eso son boxeadores de cartón . canelo cuando se en frenta con boxeadores de verdad canelo no existe que paso con Mayweather . el tata de canelo .
Great fight! Respect to both these dudes
canelo is a beast but cherry his picks... he really know who not to fight ..get money i guesa
before every fight they should test the fighters canelo looks like he used after mayweather fight from then to this day
Respect your neighborhood icecream dealer he might become a boxing legend someday.
Plant took the dude 11 rounds. Not impressed with cheater canelo
Caleb came too fast and dance too much thinking he was getting Canelo tired  Canelo was just being patient observing for the right moment  to KO
He not ready for Thanos
Orale! Canelo is a beast!
He will retire now.. canelo retire a few boxers
Canelo is the king 👑
How much money y’all think a rematch with Floyd would bring in?
The fact that his only loss is to floyd is such a piss off, he is infinitely a better boxer then floyd could ever hope to be
Mauro Ranallo's commentating is a blown way out of proportion caricature. His style is not only completely unnecessary, but incredibly grating. There is simply no reason, or benefit, to oversell a fistfight. The drama is already there and spoken for in action. Tone it down or stay in the WWE where the dialogue and the action is scripted out of necessity.
What did Nate Diaz say that one time "I'm not surprised"
WOW 💥
Canelo alvarez 🇲🇽💪🥊
Dude.. when Canelo smells blood he really turns into a predator😳
One thing i will say is it looks like a trend is starting...when a boxer loses they don't stay for a post fight interview
Canelo pretending to be tire on the 10th round to set him up with that flying left hook
Canelo is too much.
Canelo the best PPP boxer in the world Errol Spence or Crawford would have to gain weight to even give him a challenge
Had a great evening watching the fight and had also the first tamales of the season ! Congrats Canelo !  To the boxing world a Mexican gift !
Took him to round 11 on a scrub, huh? Full of the juice too. Funny!
Congratulations #1 Canelo & Mexico 🇲🇽
Mad respect for Caleb.
How is that the referee out of the blue started the count from 5??? That was retarded. However, Canelo won that fight before it even started. Hopefully he will fight Charlo or Andrade soon...
Was a good fight.  So glad the boring boxing style is in the past atm.
Just watched this 6× and experienced it like it was my first time amazing
A cheater won? I'm shocked.
That subtle push after the lefthook to setup the uppercut is so beautiful lol
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽💪🎉🎊
I LOVE  MEXICAN FIGHTERS --- THEY FIGHT TO DEATH. NEXT IS DUCKLING ERROL SPENCE AND TALKATIVE CRAWFORD !!  Viva mexico !! Filipinas !
Rigged asf he didn’t hit that man clean all fight then in the 11 he start getting flush shots shit just like the kovolev fight 😂 if you know you know…
Congrats to canelo 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
😂😂🇲🇽team canelo ❤️
0:15 Canelo is basically a hungry Lion attacking a wounded animal from this point on.
CANELO SHUT THAT WHITEBOY UP 😆
Who didn't see that coming. I didn't buy fight, because it wasn't exciting. Who outside of golovkin stands a chance to beat canelo? I felt same way about usman too.
Best fight ever 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 , la mejor pelea de canelo se sintió el amor y apoyo de la afición cuánto todos gritamos el knock out ,  Viva mexico 🇲🇽
I love how Canelo went after the kill like a bloodthirsty lion !
Canelo is a beast of a fighter 💪🏼
The most bull💩 fight I ever seen the worst actors in the world a real joke !!!!
Canelo vs Crawford would be major !!🙏🏾
Wow Caleb plant es mejor boxeador que lo que esperaba  Tiene sus huevitos bien puestos
Hats off to Plant for even lasting 11 rounds with arguably the Greatest Mexican Boxer in History !!!!  I believe only a Prime Mayweather & maybe a Prime Manny could defeat Canelo !!!!  What a great performance by the current pound for pound King ….  He has to fight Triple G one more time and of course we want Canelo vs Charlo in 2022
He made like a tree and got Planted.
Andy Ruiz Jr at 2:01 watching Canelo. Right side of screen, below the white rope.
Ahi esta para todos los mexicanos envidiosos!!!!
A la planta le faltaron patas para salir corriendo. La planta solo le quería ganar a canelo por la gran boca.
Maybe now bum ass Canelo will finally fight Andrade, Charlo, or Benavidez!!!
Now thats boxing 🥊 lol 😆 I’ll pay to watch good matches like this everytime!!!
Plant was a pillow duster. That was hand picked as it gets and every one knew before the fight, now they like you got to give respect.? Bs beat Beivol or beiterbiev he hasn't been In against anyone since they robbed ggg
Otro costal de papas 🤣🤣🤣
Even an idiot knows it was a fixed fight a fraud
La próxima ves que vallas a pelear canelito llévate un burro para que lo cargues de sinturones  se mira que ya puedes con tanto sinturon 🇲🇽
Las Vegas mafia
Caleb was fighting like there was no tomorrow, however when you fight one of the greatest of all time there is almost no chance. What he was fighting for kept him in it but I think sooner or later he will get another chance we'll keep hearing his name however Canelo is just the best in the business.
This is why you dont talk shit to mexicans or latinos at the night club or bar. You either will get KO or body bag. You play stupid games and you win stupid prizes.
Where the Canelo haters at???
CANELO FLOYD ES TU PADRE
Respect for plant did a lot better than I expected. He looked comfortable in there picking his shots. My favorite part is when they give each other that respect when the fight was over. Wish plant the best hope he bounces back. He didn’t loose to no chump. Canelo keep making history charlo or Benavides next.
See always goes to say one punch always can change a fight we all know plant was finessing canelo plant was winning like Floyd was but Caleb couldn't keep the stamina up
Floyd's legacy getting smaller and smaller.
Rematch.
He can hit across your gloves
Great finish by Canelo, but no way the ref should’ve stopped the fight right then and there. Count the champ out.
Say what you will , Canelo is that guy .
Another hand picked opponent! Way to go doing just like his master mayweather did! Lol he's hasn't fought anyone with power.......when he beats beiterbeive, or Beivol either one and I give him respect
Lmao who the fuck is Caleb plant 🪴???? Beating garbage cans out there
Great defense by Caleb for the first ~5 rounds but once Canelo figures you out, it’s just a matter of time
Eddy Reynoso hall of fame trainer.
Idk if my dad used to box but he literally predicted the fight in the first round, he said that plant would get tired and canelo would KO plant in the late rounds. Even before the fight he said “este guey no tiene nada”
I said it since the announcement of the fight. Canelo
Jjjimenez jajajajajajajajaja jajajajajajajajaja chale puro show canelo 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🙉🙉🙊🙊🙈🙈🙉🙉🙊🙊🤡🤡🙊🙉🙉🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
Canelo destroyed Plant. Plant put up a good fight
Bruh me and my family were screaming, we knew it was over when Canelo threw that left hook
VIVA MEXICO quien sigue
HELL FKN YEA!! #CHAMP #VIVAMEXICO
Question: When is this guy gonna fight a real fighter… A pound for pound list Fighter. Answer: Never.
He knocked out 3 out 4 champions to get these belts. Some were undefeated.
Can yall stop playing with my guy you don't want these problems! 🤣
Congrats to my guy Canelo...and even though Caleb was stopped in 11th I have a new found respect for that fighter. He was able to test canelo like no one else. Musch love Caleb. Keep your head up and keep swinging baby.
Dana White made $41K betting on Canelo 😂
Canelo is a absolute animal, to me he is the best fighter in boxing right now. HOWEVER!!! Like I keep saying his legacy is tainted because he got caught cheating(JUICING)!!! We don’t know if he would’ve won those other fights he won on the juice. Same thing with Tyson Fury!!! Once you get caught on the juice it just fucks up the legacy!!!🤷🏾‍♂️ 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Tyson left hook n hunting like Tyson wit that left hook n got em wit tha uppercut
They said he avoids black fighters so mayweather camp gave him dollar general mayweather to feast on lmaooo
he said what he said on instagram HE WON !!!!
Mr showboat got schooled.
When is Charlo getting his shot so yes he is cherry picking
Team Canelo shoooo
I can’t help but notice no emotion coming from Andy Ruiz 😂 like dude stayed still the whole time lol let me know when y’all find Ruiz in the crowd haha
even do he got KO i think plant stock went up just a little. giving him some good money fights with other good fighters.
Dang too bad he couldn’t beat Mayweather 😂
He's not a different breed he's simply. Mexican do not piss off a. Mexican
Dude!! When Canelo when up the ropes!  It was like scene from a movie (300).   Canelo keeps on giving up good material to remember him as on of the greatest not just for Mexicans but for who ever loves boxing.
For all them haters that still thought this Mexican would lose now you can kiss his arse
kinda shows just how good Floyd was....
You got knocked da' f#%¿ out ! 😵🤣🤣🤣🤣🏆
The way he set that left hook is amazing
Mexico produces more great fighters than anywhere in the world !!🐂 👍🐂👍
What did u expect lol
Viva Mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
At this point I think Canelo can get a heavyweight belt maybe not fury due to the crazy size difference but Usyk maybe.
Canelo knocked plant out with brutal knockout wow after the first knockdown Canelo went after him like a lion hunting for food vicious
Boy he got his ass WHIPPED
Shout out to Caleb
Madriza que le puso
Yeah fuck Plant.  VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!
ggg
He would destroy, Floyd Mayweather
Can’t break a poor boys chin unless you’re Caleb Plant.
He got that taco power 🌮🌮🌮💉💉💉
Who let that kid in there? 😂 he was being mur DURRRD
Caleb did great nothing to be ashamed it was a great fight.
Que canelo maneje el carro de checo!!!
Any one else thought about the Foreman Frazier KO??
Carajo asimismo es Lee tapate la boca queria ver al jeferi k no parara la pelea Para k lesdieran una pela.
Canelo is a beast!! Definitely p4p king 🤴!!
The tables have turned now.. he’s good at the sport but also at making money. There has been great Mexican champions that always were underpaid.. for example Marquez vs pacquiao 25 millions for pacquiao 5 for Marquez and they would still fight but with cáñelo that’s gone he’s the one making the dough.
plant was too scare!!never really seems to be himself in the ring.. did no throw nothing
And I still say he is the best boxer in the world..... He doesn't run, he throws down.... Unlike the one they call the goat of boxing.... Well my bad Mayweather is the goat.... Greenest. Of. All. Time!!!!!!!😁😁😆
i kw that he is the best figther of mexico no matter if next he lost he already bring all happines to suth america vravo
4:09 canelos reaction after he saw that black wbc belt was just 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolute Legend.
Yeah i bet he was on that juice
he was out on his feet after that left hook.
La Mera paipa! 🇲🇽💥😎
Canelo really is a goat 🐐 🙏🙏🙏🇲🇽
Canelo has made himself a top three boxer of all time.
There is levels to this bro
super power punches
Noooooow stop ducking Andrade
The way I see it Canelo going to be champ for a very long time his punches are too fierce and devastating
Canelo bad ass
Mr steroids does it again
I wish Caleb had tied up more. Canelo has in his fights many times. Caleb almost made it. REMATCH!!
People complains about how Canelo only fights white people. Ain’t that what you blm mofo want. To beat the white man lol. Stfu and bow down to this man. Doing what y’all can’t!!  Having the balls to tell the man, no I’m not fighting my own people, and no I’m not fighting any black man with no belts.
Cinnamon hit dude with some nasty shots
I don’t care about the drama. I’m just here to watch Canelo fight. He always puts on a good show
0:26 FINISH HIM!!! ARRIBA JALISCO CABRONES woot woot
There you go BIG MOUTH.
Mayweather Vs Canelo 2 or it’s all BS
Canelo Es lo que es simplemente el mejor 💪💪👏👍🏻
Caleb plant did amazing not surprised he made this a tricky fight for canelo but canelo is just to good.
SIMPLY THE BEST!!!
COWnelo alvaROIDS
Is it just me or should have Plant been given the opportunity to get up again?
Canelo is on that Designer juice 4sure. Didn't put in the work put on drugs💉
Otro COSTAL para el PAYASO ! jajajaj
Another Mexican Legend 🇲🇽 run the sport really
Canelo is the best Mexican fighter of all time!!! Top 10 of all time in boxing history
Mess With BuLL you get The Horns Faxxxxxxxxxx Big Up TO C
One thing fershure I never wanna see canelo run at me like that lol nelo is p4p king by a long shot
The wy eddy reynoso smacked canelo head lie get yo ass down here boy
Everyone was singin way 2 sexy 😂
Now let's see if he will fight the other top fighters quit ducking the top guys
Canelo is the greatest ever
At times throughout the fight Plant looked good but Canelo is on another level! #VivaMexicoCabrones!
Kitty infront of an Apex Predator
I had Plant as the only boxer that could beat Canelo. Plant wasn't Plant at all last night. Canelo is just too strong, and too good. I don't see Canelo getting beat by anyone now.
not many boxing fans will understand this. Plant jabbed and had decent foot worked and defended well. I gave him three rounds. But if that was plant plane to beat canelo it was not enough. Plant jabbed so canelo would struggle to come in and land his shots, but it didnt work. good foot work, but canelo cut the ring easy. Defended well. I would say those punches landed on plants arms and back before the knock out. But the blows to the arms, body, shoulder, and back were enough to gas out plant.   Dont be delusional, plant boxed (basic fundamentalist, jab move, and defend) survive from  the first round and got knocked out. Plant had no fight plan for canelo. To bad the ref didnt let him get up the second time! VIVA MEXICO
You want to fight you want to take a bitting even better . Don. Antonio Grandson for sure.viva tecolotlan
Caleb Plant never had Canelo in a compromised position the entire fight. Canelo did exactly what he said he was going to do and walked him down and worked him over with low volume/high power shots. Canelo is king.
Mexican pride 🔥
Seems like Plant took a dive…
Caleb kept a good guard up preventing Canelo from landing that vicious left hook most of the fight. Even when they don’t land clean they hurt - but that last one was right on the money. Ref was correct in stopping it after that straight right to the temple. Hell of a fight by both men!
Mexico 🇲🇽
Viva mexico
💀
https://youtu.be/rCaQKPPA5Ig
The last look he gave plant when he left him on the ground was priceless! KING CANELO👑🙌💕
He needs to fight David Benevidez
No respect to plant.
Ref should have called it at the standing 8 .....caleb was on straight warrior shit
Alos vatos fáciles Ya comprado hasta le corre para enfrente pero a GGG asta le corría pero para tras  no Manche yo ni loco pajar para ver a este vato serlo mas millonario 👎🏻
Anyone know the name of the song in the background
Where them haters at? 🤫🤫 #KingCanelo
Drop 160 now 168 had scrubs come on now
The way canelo running thru ppl should ironically show u how GREAT Floyd truly was bruh...
Good thing Canelo got the ko is the fight went to the scorecards. There was the possibility of canelo getting robbed. It was Pbc promotion Pbc Judges And Pbc Network showtime
Now someone put eye of the tiger over this. Viva mexico!
To bad he can’t beat Floyd mayweather
Fight one or the Charlos bra stop fighting cans
Great KO.
Dunno why people think Plant would win. Canelo obviously has the experience
As a Canelo fan I was biting my nails last night , I think canelo looks a little slower, but more powerful. He had more speed. I really didn't like the way he fought last night. He was getting hit alot. It seems to me he depends on his power now, He can't really adjust to these slick boxers.
Too bad maweather is past his prime because I think Canelo is just a better boxer now
Can we all admit Caleb was putting in work with the hand and foot work? Obviously Nelo dominated but hats off to both!!! THE FIRST EVER MEXICAN UNDISPUTED KING!!!
$Ese canelito es la mera riata cuantos milloncitos le an de aber Dado al guerito$ por dejarse ganar$
I wonder if anyone sees Andy chilling wit damn near no reaction. As if he seen this 1000 times before 😂😂😂
Thanks to both champions for the show and all the combatants of the evening.
Big props to Caleb plant. He lasted longer than I thought. Congrats to Canelo on joining the undisputed club
Look at the black dudes reaction at the 2:00 min mark sitting behind Errol spence.. On .25 speed slow motion that was my reaction 😂
Great champion's that came and went.  Canelo will be just like them never forgotten.great fight from the champ.  Nothing too be ashame of Caleb you put up a good fight.once again great win champ. Viva Mexico Cabrones.😎 big loco East los angeles ca 💯 🇲🇽 🇺🇸.
OMFG plant literally whip his ass for 11 rounds ! With a better fighter ( like Mayweather...Ward) he would lost fr but hats off ! Lets be real tho ...that was plant fight the whole night !
Fight of the year 2021 noo way I don't think so Tyson Fury Vs Wilder 3 take that tittle
Hate him .or love him... my respect to CANELO!!!!
Dont talk bout his mom😎
This shows how truly great Floyd Mayweather really is.
Canelo hasn’t fought Spence nor charlo!! Plus prime mayweather would beat that boy back to Mexico easy!!
Boxer? What fight were u watching? Goof!
Couldnt Beat Mayweather tho so he is no King
Ya se estaban saboreando los heaters del canelo, si hubiera sido por desición unánime..pero se la pelaron el KO llego jejejeje puro México raza
Mayweather don’t want no smoke
El mejor el Rey 🤴 viva el canelo 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Canelo has to fight better competition Period.. who is the best fighter he's beaten?... Triple G really lol
HE STILL CAN'T BEAT MAYWEATHER
ESTA PELEA ES PARA LOS HEATERS
It was pitiful watching that friggin hillbilly clown run away from King Canello all night but in the end he was just a big mouth punk that made a killing just running away from the MAN!!!
God damn it he did it ,viva la Mexico CABRONES
Keep him from snapping his fingers tho.
Benavidez mops him.
CANELO HA ECHO LO QUE GAMAS FLOYD MARQUEZ MORALES BARRERA Y MUCHO MAS AN ECHO. LOS CINTURONES Y CORONARSE COMO EL REY. GRACIAS POR TANTOS TRIUNFOS CANELO
Plant looked so embarrassed 😳
Canelo a beast the best
JA JA ,CANELO UNO DE LOS MEJORES, EN LA ACTUALIDAD,ES UNA FELICIDAD  VERLO BOXEAR Y SOBRE TODO GANAR,EXTRAORDINARIO,!!!!!!!
I been saying for YEARS canelo can be THE best p4p fighter. #VivaLaMexico
Sometimes, those frilly shorts won't save you!
Canelo is not a "pressure" fighter
History repeats itself. A young canelo outboxed by a smarter Floyd Mayweather. And Now, a younger inexperienced boxer outboxed by a great canelo. How he responds to his loss will be key.
Caleb Plant did the best mayweather defense ive ever seen I have seen many boxer imitate Floyd but plant had it down until he got caught
Excellent fight cánelo viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Now watch the Canelo haters 1. To leave Caleb team😱  2. To come with a new set of excuses for why Canelo won🤪  3. To claim 🍒 Charlo can beat Canelo😒
Esa pelea fue arreglada y además canelo para ser el mejor de ese peso tiene que pelear con los mejores y lo dudo que el balla pelear con un contrincante poderoso el boxeo es mafia
Así no más quedó Plantado 🪴
CANELO IS THE KING OUT THERE. CANELO ALVAREZ.  👊👊👊👊✊
No one beats Canelo apart from Mayweather who fucked him up. To beat him u have to hit him n not get hit n Mayweather is a master on that.
Floyd still beat his ass 🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
The REAL boxing match was Chandler vs Gaethje last night at UFC 268. That fight was just something else! Usman would destroy Canelo, IMO
This guy is a TRUE warrior
Leaping left hook that'd make Joe Frazier proud.
He would never be a true boxer if he keeps fighting low class fighters just the truth..
Nobody is beating this man anytime soon..
Canelo doesn’t fight anyone that’s in the top 5 he picks his fights he fights no names lol then acts like he’s the best, you just fought a no name calm down
I want to dislike Canelo so bad because he can be an absolute douche but there's no denying what he is and that's the greatest P4P fighter on the planet. Him being only 31 I don't see his reign ending anytime soon
Mayweather wish he can be better then CANELO
Plant wasn't even fighting back boring fight
the GOAT's legend Floyd Mayweather continues to grow with this Canelo's win
I love Canelo but I still want them to check his piss cause he a monster.
Dam how many belts does that make??...King Canelo!
For people saying Plant is trash how bout you try lasting at least 10 rounds with canelo
Theres no one that has reach canelos level.hes the one
Viva mexico cabrons🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽especial mente a todos los latinos. Mexico sigue hacienda historia.❤🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 💙
Plant didn’t look confident. Didn’t seem like he wanted to be there or that he believed he could win. But the thing is he was looking good. Felt like he would have done better with some more confidence.
I missed this though cause I was watching the UFC. The ref did an amazing job with the count but there was definitely a bias with the count. I wish every count was like this tho.
Canello viva mexico salutue to you i  thought you were tired then it was over
I told you Canelo is relentless he's ruthless and he says what he says He talks to talk and walk the walk and you can tell right away as soon as he knocked them out the 1st time and so the 1st blood come out he wanted or destroy him Literally destroy him And there's nobody in The world That can be him in his class Hi is there # for # champion Of all time And I bet Mexico is proud of him!!!!!
Mayweather= points Canelo= puts your ass on the floor. Ima put some dirt in your eye.
iTs StRaP SeAsOn BeYaChEs!!!
I'd like to see Canelo vs Mayweather NOW vs then
King Canelo thanos
Who else bet that plant was gonna get KO’d in 11th round?
and still lost to Mayweather hahahahaha
Amazing
The moment Caleb backed away when Canelo was against the ropes, we all knew Caleb was hurting too much already.
LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!?
Plant was getting up after the last knockdown early stoppage Sergio mora worse ref in the game
Mayweather fans have left the chat. Unified UNDISPUTED
At the end of the 10th you could really tell Caleb took too much damage to the body he was flexing his midsection trying to stay up
Canelo is to fye
Very nice he has grown alot as a fighter
Viva mexico cabrones
Respect 👍
so happy for canelo...first Mexican to do it, always proud to be part Mexican lets go....
Just listen to that grunt of pain when that left hook landed on Plant
Caleb went to fat the first rounds and at the end he started getting tired 👩🏾‍🦯
I knew Canelo would win this, I should’ve bet on the fight.
Jesus loves you
Even with the Victor Conte steroids Caleb was on Canelo still beat his ass!
Nobody is beating Canelo at this point! Props to plant he had a terrific game plan! Was competitive all night. The rounds were close!
The Goat 🐐
Mauro a terrible announcer. Just came to see the knockout. Glad I'm out of boxing 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
🇲🇽
Great fight,Baby Mike Tyson .
"King" Canelo couldn't stopped the real King Mayweather!! King is when you're undefeated!! 😆
Was there any questions that Plant punches like a plant? Only men who can beat Canelo are GGG, BENAVIDEZ, BIVOL AND BETERBIEV.
What a show Canlo put on
Stop playin with Canelo too easy
Canelo alvarez, you did it again 👏 🙌 🥊🥊 Mucho Respeto!
lol now I know why plant was at the track practicing 30m sprints and stepping over hurdles. got him through the first 10 rounds and then for some reason in the 11th he got careless with his mayweather defense strategy and got hit for the first time in his life (just talking inside the ring nothing else). glad I didn't by the PPV.
That’s what happens when you talk about a Mexicans mother can’t fuck with us Mexicans
Still got his ass kicked by Mayweather !!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
People understand that canelo has more pro experience than most fighter  that’s his 60th pro fight this should happen. If plant was on fight 60 it would be a different fight. Still Good though
He impressed me time and time again
He is on another level. If this Canelo showed up when he fought Mayweather, he would have knocked him out.
Sorry! UFC was more entertaining.
Amazing what PED'S can do for an already talented athlete!
00:22 Canelo Hood mode
Canelo won't need any more belts. Benavides I suppose is next
Yeah it is such thing as being lucky and that's exactly what it was because he was outclassed the other guy just didn't hold up and that's it canelo is still overrated to me and I'm 81 years old and I've been watching fights for a long time and I'm telling you something he's overrated wait till he get somebody to really know how to fight and hold it and got stamina he's done and it's going to happen so enjoy your champion while you can
Was there drug test before and after the fight? Just saying!
Y’all don’t understand. He’s in his prime right now!!! This is legendary
Got his ass hit tRNA do the shoulder roll  tRNA do what Floyd did got his ass knocked out
Ain't nobody gonna say Canelo lacks a killer instinct.
Plant guy is trash bro canelo gave him so many opportunities to actually hit him dude canelo was trolling him the fight was so terrible
Caleb Plant did himself proud. What a tough, game fighter. Hats off to Canelo. The best pound for pound out there.
Can’t F with CANELO
Caleb could most definitely win a 2nd fight.
Shouldn’t have said maddafacka to him about he’s mom
Canelo,aka the matador. Mayweather said he was going to this lmfao That boy lost at the press conference when he slapped the glasses off his face
no le gano a nadie ..ridículo esa gente ke lo apoya deberían de exigirle ke se ponga a pelear con alguien  ke balga la pena ...cuando peleó con floy no pudo ganar ningún miserable round
Como la ven los que dicen que le ponen flanes? Estilo, inteligencia y pegada como patada de mula, es todo.
Caleb Plant had some hand speed in the fight that gave Canelo problems he should’ve used it more.
Canelo is a walking zombie. Them Mexican rooster ROIDS are strong
Callum Smith was the best at 168
Caleb put up a good fight Against a BEAST, sad to see a few people still boo’d him in the end.
I love how they played the Mexican national anthem! Mexicans don’t take a knee for the anthem like the US, viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Imagine Canelo coming towards you with Intentions to kill you, and no matter how much you punch him he wont stop till you kiss the floor. GOAT
Walked him down for 11 rounds straight.  I Lena Cáñelo told him he’s gonna feel something different.
Canelo was better conditioned. The longer the fight went, the more in his favor. You have to be in monster shape prepared to go the distance to beat a fighter like Canelo . He was not.
Canelo is a Mt. Rushmore boxer now.
Canelo  Alvarez, learn that style of fighting from tank Davis, just like he stole style from Mayweather
I don't respect this dude he a cherry picker you don't fight African Americans not the good ones .he ain't took care of none of the lion Brothers he got his ass whoop by  May weather and he been cherry-picking beating up nobody's for I don't know how long. And if anybody in the comments want to go to war with me choose your words carefully. M************
But it's dope how his fight with Mayweather shaped his whole career he changed gears and the whole mindset of his boxing was changed I think it was so important for him to lose that fight
Respect Plant!! He tried, but CANELO IS A YOUNG LEGEND
+550 from Canelo beating Plant in rounds 10-12 😎
Nela aint the champ till he beats Benavidez witch he will keep ducking
Everyone talk about Plant beating Canelo lol
Couldn’t handle that tempo. That’s championship tempo and power. Ain’t no one else doing it like Canelo.
0:23 u can see calebs face dude is scared to death
The third jab on the second knock down was the one that put him out it was a clean hit on that ear had him ringing
Caleb lasted way longer than people were given him credit for, he does belong at this level. Canelo is just too strong and Caleb could only box him for so long until he finally got caught. Shows you how good a boxer mayweather is.
Best boxer ever
Parace ke se subio al caballito de Palo despues del putaso..😄
The moment I saw Caleb training with his wife I knew he was gonna lose 😂
Well I didnt need to buy this fight to know the outcome. Beautiful finish tho from the champ. He is def a final boss level fighter.
So surprising  Nobody But seriously in both knockdown plant 🪴 was Planted on his feet. No foot work or head movement. I mean come on. That's not elite fighting. That's amateur shit. I would like to see Canelo vs Charlo. Now there's a fight.
You can't fight Canelo with you face looking down.
Canelo is a beast ! But shoutout to Caleb plant he made canelo look like a average boxer wish it went all 12 !
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Por vidaaaa
With all this win canelo still doesn't get the recognition...I don't get it...
I'm a big fan of canelo. But in all honesty Caleb Plant is the only guy to give current Canelo a fight. He held his own. Not only that but he made canelo work for that knock out more. Canelo has also struggled before with the Philly shell. Which his only lose was with the master of the Philly Shell, Floyd Mayweather. I would love to see Caleb come back with some Mayweather Sr. Training and give canelo a run for his money. I personally think Caleb could get some more refined movement but the power is there. There were a couple of straight rights during the fight that made canelo bounce back.
Vivaaaa mexicoooo
Tim Bradley called this one on the money!
Caleb sin guantes  es muy bueno para rasguñar
Let me say this, Canelo is a BEAST the only dude that legit beat Canelo was MayWeather but besides that this dude has STEam rolled his opponents....
Canelo stands alone as the best in the sport. Him Tyson Fury and Terrance Crawford are one of a kind fighters!
Canelo changes leves Caleb expected a body shot and got caught flush with the left hook
😭No more, no more,no more!!!!!
Caleb's tactics: run like floyd Mayweather jr🐓,strangle Canelos left arm🤦‍♂️ 😏🤭🤣
Trash talk goes wrong. Caleb thinks he can beat Canelo by copying floyds style. WTF! He could've been better if he uses his own
I saw Tyson in red jacket
What was name of the song playing @1:30
The amount of belts this guy has to travel around the world with is insane, Suitcase strictly for his belts XD
His opponent Is not a boxer  he is a clown, easy piece of cake..
I really fuck with Canelo but when we look back at who he beat for those 168 belts at super middleweight: rocky fielding, callum smith, (yildirm lol) billie j Saunders, Caleb plant. Not exactly Hall of fame fighters or even all time greats in my opinion. Getting the belts ain't the same as beating the BEST. Every time he announces a fight the initial reaction is usually "KO within 6 or less" lol That says everything about his opposition as of late. Would love for him to get a non controversial, CLEAR W against a real great/threat.
My respects to a great fight from Caleb Plant and congratulations to the new legend from this era Canelo Alvarez 👏
To all those fools who kept saying that Plant was guna win, I TOLD YOU! Canelo is the Undisputed super middle weight champ!
Same old same old!!!!!  always talk and no action!!!!!!! Everyone knew who was going to win this fight. Especially these ones that talk the biggest talk they always go down
Never seen a boxer that got hit so hard he got up and ran to a neutral corner
The Greatest ever!
Still lost to Mayweather
See!  Roids give a 10% advantage. Why would anyone not take them?
The power and the feet movement on Canelo …the man knows how to dance in the ring …that’s why he was crowned king in the end !! 👊😎
But mayweather is the best right lol BS!!!!! NOT ONE of mayweathers fights were this entertaining!!!! Canelo in his prime would embarrass mayweather in his prime!!!
Holly shit.....this man just shuts your light off....genius
I just want to watch this over & over haha
This is what happens to the Cockazoid in boxing
I feel the ref should of counted to 10 and not stopped the fight ,
Canelo is a beast....
Porque? cada boxeador que pelea con canelo nunca pelea !!! 🤣🤣🤣
The most boring fight ever...
BJ Sanders and C Plant have that mayweather type style and who did Canelo only loss. So any fighter as that type style is gonna get STOPPED!
Canelo is more active than all the other good boxers out there combined
The REAL Best ever !!!!
the goat give em Mayweather
I watched this match and I was impressed with Plants sportsmanship. When Canelo came up to him after the match. Plants first words were you are the best.
Caleb tenia para ganar para hacer pelea para dar batalla ..... no se preparo .... no lo tomo muy enserio la pelea ......
1+ million views in 10 hours shows how popular Canelo is.
Canelo is on boss mode 😎
CANELO = FIASCO
yall noticed andy ruiz in the crowd😂
This was a boring ass fight
Que putiza!!! See when you box more than you talk, you get your ass whooped!!
We all knew that would happen. Poor plant. Lost his plant.
Great fight no BS straight boxing none of that running around shit.
El canelo esta muy preparado .... es muy disciplinado ..... tiene golpes de piedra .... tiene las manos muy pesadas ..... pega duro y seco ..... de esos golpes que apen.....d ....jan ....feo ..
No mames que actuación de los dos buenos payasos
Canelo is a good fighter. Not a great fighter. If he was a great fighter he would of beat Mayweather. The last great fighter from Mexico is Julio Cesar Chavez. Pound for pound canelo would be required to lick Julio's sweaty jock strap to even be allowed in the same room with Julio.
Mayweather would win today. He will always have a loss viva America
Why didn’t the referee start a 10 count? That’s what he’s supposed to do. TKO vs KO.
Dude, that uppercut was so fast it looked fast in slow motion, and plant blocked the first punch, but the punch went straight through the glove. Insane how hard canelo punches.
He is a Beast !
Viva mexico cab!%&÷$!!!!!!
Anyone that says canelo is a fraud is just deep in thier feelings
Looks like the initial right uppercut did all the damage, not the left hook
Reporter to canelo.how many belts you want??.canelo: yes!!!!!
VIVA MEXICO
Caleb is a Joke 😂
Definitely the Best Pound for Pound
Love him or Hate him We were gifted the Honor of being alive to witness The Great Canelo Alvarez during his prime. He aint even close to being done. People from the future will Time Travel back to this Historic Time.
Canelo planted Plant into the canvas
Wait.. where is the plant fanboys
Awesome fight Canelo
He’s gonna be top 3 of all time
Canelo is at the top of everyone right now!!! Who’s next!?!?!?!? 😎👊🏽
Mejor. que. Chavez. Canelo!!!!!!!!!!!!!nunca   Canelo. Pelea. Con.  Chatarra. Chavez. Es. Pura. Chatarra. Y. Llorona. Jajajaja jajajaja Jajajaja Jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja Jajajaja jajajaja 😜👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍🏻✌🏻🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤳🤳🤳🤳the. Best. Canelo 🤳🤳✌🏻👍🏻
No el.primer.raun, le aguanto a canelo. alverez.🥊le salio.muy.picante.el.tapatio.🇲🇽
All hail king canelo??? Get the fuck outta here never said that for Floyd and Floyd is the true king
Still a hocanelo
King canelo 🌧 rains supreme
Incredible…. 👑 of 🥊….. Caleb put up a great fight, just wasn’t enough.. he’s got plenty of time to sharpen his skills and build more power as he steps up… Cáñelo is just different, he puts the hammer when he steps in the ring “can’t touch this”
That kid Caleb had alot of confidence. In the fight I knew at times where he stood in a Philly shell stance while reading the punches it was going to cost him. I knew canelo would eventually land flush bcuz at times a punch was slightly getting through the defense when plant did that. The game plan to beat canelo been out there but it's HARD to do especially to a canelo who experienced it a few times.that of being a fleet footed fighter. Plant was controlling the fight, at times i wanted more jabs bcuz they will try their best not to give plant a decision by moving and making canelo miss with an occasional counter
I feel bad for Caleb
Fue un poco difisil pero sepudo
Those uppercuts of Canelo are just nasty!
Not the best until fights the best
And why so many claimed plant was gonna anialate my guy canelo. When canelo picked this plant apart 😂
The way Canelo had him 🏃🏻 at :27 is how he had him packing n running back to Tennessee without a word to the press..
Wow that looked staged I don’t believe in boxing It looks to set up
Next opponent Jermall Charlo?
Edgar Allan Poe
Plant is not a push over opponent. Canelo is just on another level.
Caleb lasted a good amount of punches and time in there, but Canelo's pressure was just too much that night.
Caleb tried to use a similar defense to Mayweather. So he would lean his head back and avoid head shots. It appeared to frustrate Canelo for a bit. But Caleb Literally sacrificed his body doing this. He absorbed vicious body shots over and over....it was just a matter of time. Great job by Canelo and his corner.
Congratulations canelo you are the king
Orgullo tapatio el canelo !!!
Canelo is a legend, the GOAT! 🤘🏻 At the end of the fight Plant humbled himself & Canelo showed true professionalism by accepting Plant’s apology. Plant also had a good fight too. Amazing talent & Excellent sportsmanship 👏🏼
Plant won't grow no more 🤣
Canelo es Mexico hombre 👨 💪🏻👍se á creado con pura tortilla de maíz 🌽 comida nutritiva dela cual su cuerpo sus huesos se mantienen fuertes no come puro pan 🍞 papas fritas 🍟 tal ves si lo aga pero no tanto 😂😁canelo es dedicación asu trabajo es pacion por su trabajo canelo les duela aquíen les duela el es una ⭐️ brillando está asiendo buen trabajo 👍 hombre fuerte 💪🏻 ba con todo de didido alo que va mis respectos para el i para el contrario le peleó bien 👍 le iso pelea el otro pero pues no sele dio no pudo vencer a  canelo 😁
Viva mexico pendejos
Cuando un mexicano gana asi como canelo que no es ingreido dan ganas de apollarlo pero ai unos que apenas son recién aparecidos iya se green la gran cosa
Caleb was winning the fight! Til he got lazy with his right hand and didnt hold the phone. He kept taking that left hook to the head! Great job tho Caleb!!!
Canelo needs to fight Benavidez.
plant gots that sorry Mayweather style..fight with ur back turn..glad canelo knocked plant out
Props to Caleb, he’s a hell of a fighter but he needs to establish power if he ever wants to get to that next level. He’ll need it against the likes of benavidez, derrell, maybe charlo ect but everything else is nice. Canelo is a different beast tho so maybe tonight was just an outlier
Charlo better stay at 160for a while. He will get demolished by canelo
CanPEDlo the greatest Mexican ain't no way in a Jamaican tank top oscar who is just a top 10 Mexican boxer fought prime mosley 2x Trinidad vargas mayweather hopkins parnell Whitaker pacquiao  Barrera Erik Martinez jaun Marquez Chavez all fought wars against the best in they prime CanPEDlo fought ggg 2x on steroids that's it in his prime and a old mayweather old mosley and washed up cotto and korvelov when he fight Benavides and charlo two fighters that can hurt him back we can talk
Canelo va Mayweather now  let’s gooooo
Why was he running jajajajajaj he’s not as tough as he said he was .Too much training  to end up running like a bitch whatta shame
A good boxer vs an Elite boxer.  We saw the difference.
Canelo = Steroid
What a fight! Canelo the best in the world. Respect to Caleb he is a warrior went out on his shield.
ARRIBA EL CANELO ALVAREZ Y VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽 CABRONESSSSS!!!
Rigged fight. They didn’t even do a count on the second knockdown. Canelo is….trash.
how much did canelo pay you off?! this is why boxing sucks
Caleb did well
I like the fight. Love the sport. Great boxers. Have a lot of respect for caleb  Viva 🇲🇽 Mexico
“Finish him “
Caleb is a warrior
Pura mamada!!
Caleb ran to the corner like his go tell his momma. Momma I hit with a uppercut
CANELO 👑👊👊
Plant talked all that shit at the press conference just gave canelo even more reason to knock his head off.
Canelo a beast but I want him 2 fight charlo or Andrade then ill b sold
Nothing Else We Want The Super Fight Canelo Vs Ward .......
The better fighter showed up and handled business
I thought Plant was too early in his career for this fight.  If he keeps doing what he's been doing and actually improves, he's probably 5 good fights away from one of the best.
Plant was talking all that shit and just for him to get dawgwalked and was on his knees
He dried up Plants leaves  🌱🌳🍃🍂
Caleb fought w fear... that's why he didn't throw  ponches
I wonder if Andre Ward is ever tempted to come out of retirement. 168 isn’t the deepest division but Ward was king of it. Be a helluva fight.
I thought it only fitting his only loss is to another great
I mean what was so impressive about Plant? The fact he lasted 11 rds? Lol..…I had Canelo winning every rd up until the tko. If Canelo used his Jab more & threw more combinations he would of got plant out of there much earlier.
Best boxer I’ve seen in a while
The Goat lives
Who actually thought plant had a chance?
And with a round spare! 👊🏻
Caleb can only learn from this and nothing to be ashamed of. Nelo is a monster!
Se llegó ahora si el tiempo de ver a Canelo pelear  con verdaderos oponentes en la división de las 175 libras, ya no le quedó nada más que hacer en las 168 libras! Buena Victoria Campeón!!!
Floyd se rie de este,le dio una paliza,y con 13 años más que el
The best decision Canelo made was to leave Golden boy promotions….   GREAT JOB BOTH PLANT AND CANELO…. GREAT WIN CANELO!!!
Nashville stick to country music leave the boxing to the Mexicans
Smfh drops another egg plant...🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Canelo should be careful carrying all those belts, he could get tendinitis.
Anybody suprised?
Mexico producing the best boxers again
Anybody else felt the fight was a lot closer than the judges gave it credit for?! Caleb boxed a beautiful game plan especially in the early rounds!!!
Pepas by Farruko! 👍🏾🇵🇷
Elite fighter vs great fighter  canelo it’s an elite fighter , if y’all can’t see that , then you are not paying attention. Viva Mexico
Tell floyd we want part 2 vs canelo lets see if he got 🏀
Salute to Caleb Plant He’s a Really Good Boxer… However If u a Real Fan of The Almighty Canelo… You know he different different 🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
Mystery meat won last night….
Canelo just like vegeta mexican pride

Congrats to the  👑👑👑👑👑!👍💪
YYEYYYYEEAAASSSD!! CANELO ALVEREZ POUND FOR POUND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 *CRIES*
Plant will beat him no doubt next time.
Caleb fought good. He just ran into the man. Canelo is unbeatable until father time gets him.
RAW MEAT STRIKES AGAIN!!!!
Rematch right away
Cánelo in his prime > Mayweather in his prime
Imagine how happy Canelo woke up this morning
Those hands are a problem. Just too much power.
Bro that was Caleb plant's best performance of his career cause Holy shit he made Canelo work for that win lol, Canelo is just on another level! 🎉
Still can’t beat mayweather
Made money on Canelo but TN is proud of Caleb
seeingthis video in my recommendation: 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱📈📈📈📈📈📈💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿 LESSSSSS GOOOOOOOOO
That fresh cut to the back of the head from Eddy got Canelos attention more than anything plant landed throughout the whole fight.
That’s boxing! 🥊 not like those fake ass Paul brothers!
That side position got him in trouble
Jajaja suerte que se esquivó ese izquierdazo porque si no lo manda para el otro mundo 😬
Congrats to Canelo!4 fights in 11 months against world class fighters and stopped 3 out of 4. King Canelo! Amazibg!
Así se le cierra la boca a los hocicones viva Mexico 🇲🇽 cabrones
Future Fights: "David Benavidez" . He's Got Speed And Great Power Punch Combinations. His Body Build Looks Light Weight Though.
Let me call Floyd!!
Its complete cannelo is officially the best boxer in the world my man collected all the infinity stones and restored the balance lol
Mexican pride
We Latinos are Trending...its our time
I got to give it to Plant for taking the fight and going to the 11th round
Viva Mexico Cabrones!!!
God damn man Canelo out here acting like Darkseid looking for the anti-life equation 😂😂
Good fight I'll give the champ his respect I had plant up 1-2rnds I don't know what the guy with the unofficial score card seen
He just be whipping ass and taking names lol
Awesome Fight!! Legendary! Caleb hung tough. Just too much Canelo power...
PODER LATINO 👊
Great fight and hey plant you win some you lose some hold your head up bubba u fought a hell of a fight now go back to training and get the title back..
Next time Canelo fights a slick boxer the haters are gonna say- he’s had trouble with trout, Lara and Plant! He hasn’t improved! 😂
Cáñelo did a great job … he went crazy at the end because he knew he was finished .. still I was scare Caleb would throw one those punches and knock cáñelo out because he wasn’t paying attention .
I love both of these fighters, hard to see Caleb lose like that
Canelo still lost to GGG 🥱
Plant thought he was Mayweather with that shoulder roll but Canelo said nope!
it doesn't look like fight to me that's more like beating. sorry haters n jealousy people keep trying 😅😆😁😁😆
All the plant homosexuals are salty rn lol
2:09 ruiz’s face im the crowd 😭
Ke golpes tan pendejos paresia pelea de escuela..Como lo e dicho siempre en un pendejo con suerte..
Best highlights on YouTube https://youtu.be/emqBNMoHUUk
Plants punches were all on canelos gloves..  and the few that did connect had no power behind them...    Plant wanted to win by points...  But canelo wanted to drop his Shit talkin ass...
Canelo haters from few years ago are now jumping on the bandwagon lol 😂
Canelo toyed with that fool…😂👊🏼👊🏼👍🏼
It was a left hook, not a crazy upper cut.
Mauro Ranallos commentary really bugs me, it’s so corny it almost ruins big moments like this
You could just tell the way Canelo rushed back in to cut the ring off after the knock down that Plant wasn't gonna see R12.
Would love to meet you inside and outside the ring Canelo, got nothing but respect for you 🙏🏾
Why people keep talking mayweather floyd fifty retired if canelo wins they will say Floyd was old if floyd wins it will make canelo look bad its a lose lose situation.
😂😂😂 dam bro
Caleb is a great fighter. Anybody else in the division Caleb plant will beat them with pure boxing alone. Canelo is just that good. And this is coming from a Mayweather fan I gotta give credit where it’s due
He didn’t want it the world seen wat he was about
I think both put up a good fight. But canelo won by power. But gg
Told my Uncle Canelo was gonna knock the soil out of Plant
And GGG is still fighting bums all across the world.
I don’t see Canelo losing in the future ever.
Homeboy broke through that Philly 🐚..amazing, I had Plant up by one round but Damn......
The 👑
*Laughable* Coward fighting bums.. Stop saying Viva Mexico, you don't deserve to say it !!
the way canelo jogged to Mans was lowkey funny, Viva Mexico🔥😎
Joke
50-0 TBE
🤝 Caleb Plant. You are still a Champ my Brother. 🇲🇽 🤝 🇺🇸
I taught about when Mike Tyson said… when I hit him he was making girly sounds. Sounded like a Smurf sound.
In canelo mind "this is chess not checkers young buck" 😈😈😈
The guy was standing right in front of him. No movement at all. Easy target.....
King Canelo!!!  P.S. Gervontaa tank Davis is a sucker that cherry picks fights STILL…..carry on
He made it 4 rounds past what I expected
Remember everyone.  Don’t say motherfucker next to Canelo or to him.
Everybody wanna fight like Tank
I'll be glad when he fights a real champion. Cherry picking bums
Caleb learned a lot last night he will be back Buuuut Canelo maxed him out damn
The king of the chingadasos..Caleb just a little bit*** with big mouth.
People are bothered with the fact canelo is greatness and him being a Mexican boils there blood 🩸, Mexico stand tf up 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👑👑🥳🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 we got a undisputed king
Next time don’t talk about someone mom or a Mexican will hurt you 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I just don't like that pawing with the jab tactic used by many fighters. Particularly by black pugilists. It should be considered cheating. Mainly because you are literally blinding your opponent by sticking that glove out there. Most fighters won't see the other hand come in directly behind it. Back in the day some refs were opposed to this tactic. Even calling the fighter out for using such tactic. I can see where Cabe got his swag from. Nelo is just too strong and slick for this. Pushing Cabe back to unload the uppercut. Congrats to 'King Nelo' and his family.
Someone tell Plant to block those punches with his hands, not his face 😬
Now lets see him fight Mayweather.  I remember him early on and he is 10 times better now.
bro this was so worth my money
plant won this fight.
Most Of The Fight Caleb Beat Him Period. He Got Lazy And Got Hit. Shit Happens. Lesson Learned. We Only Get Better From Here 💯
When Jake and paul see him fight at las Vegas and they scared of him
Complete domination
Doesn't matter how long he lasted or if he put up a good He still got put down !
why stop the fight he could’ve got up
It's weird how most of us living on Earth will never meet or even acknowledge each other's existence. For example, if you're reading my comment; this is probably the first and last time you'll ever see me.
Canelo a very bad man wow he got stronger as fight went on scary shit bro wow.
ALL HAIL KING CANELO..... shit was cold
Why did the ref wave it off so soon?? Its an UNDISPUTED fight give them at least a 10 count
New respect for Plant! He went longer than most thought, I wouldn’t of been surprised if it had gone all 12. With that being said Canelo was winning regardless.
Once he hit that ear area I knew it was over..
Great job to Caleb Plant, is a great fight. Canelo is a different breed!!!!!
Blood coming out of Plants ear, not good. Canelo is a bull! Wow.
This Canelo vs Prime Mayweather? Imagine he steps of out retirement to fight him. Easy 300M check. Easy. I don’t buy fights and I’d buy that for sureee!!
Canelo did a great job
Got to give canelo his props he the baddest at super middle weight. Nobody can beat him David,  charlo, boo boo none of them guys can beat him.
El Rey 👑
The left and uppercut finished him. The 2nd wasn't even necessary
Yessssssssssss
Why don’t y’all post the real highlights when Canelo was getting out boxed clown Canelo fan’s gonna say he wasn’t but real one’s seen the fight.
At least he had the balls to get in there. 🤷‍♂️
I'm a newbie and a casual but it seemed like Canelo good have ended it at anytime 5-11.... Am I right?
He still lost to GGG in their first bout
Respect to plant for fighting a crack head 💉💉💉
Canelo felicitaciones de un parsero Colombia no eres el mejor de los mejores. A   Plant got your Ass kick.
me and my entire family lost our voices last night
But Canelo afraid of Boobie!!!!
@3:34 MOST APEX BOXER IN OUR ERA
Plant was feeling the pressure the moment he stepped in that ring. He got smaller and Canelo got bigger.
Whoever hyped up Plant, deserves to take those punches. LOL. Boy looked like an amature in that ring.
Puro Mexico 🇲🇽 puro JALI$co
Respect to Caleb, he impressed a lot of people but ultimately like Canelo said, there’s levels to this. VIVA MEXICO CABRONES 🇲🇽
It happens when try to bully the bull
Damn he talk it an he walk it  king canelo
Viba México desde Honduras hulada
0:20 When tu abuela dice que si fuiste tu quien le rompio cazuelas y tu jefa lista para surtirte!
AND THE NEW AND STILL CHAMPION OF THE WORLD CALa!!! wait ✋ NOPE SAUL "CANELO " ALVARRZ
Great fight! Plant lasted longer than I thought
vicious.
I knew canelo will whip that ass.now everybody can shut up,I'm laughing at plant fans😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Viva mexico cabrones
Another easy 15g I just won right there.
Latinos will soon take over the game no lie we hungry and less taimed
Good fight 👍
Or PLANT Was So Reserved In That Fight That He Failed To Throw A Good Power Punch Combination At All When The Fact That He Had The "REACH" Advantage. Congrats To Camelo For Winning.
Cayo Como una perra
Within two years I’m knocking Canelo out.
Andy Ruiz 2:03
Canelo can beat the shit out of Mayweather now 🤣
Ariva el canelo cores como las viejas
Plant just couldn't hold up! Canelo is jut on a different level!
Let’s face it canelo needs to fight someone that’s fire like him. Only fighters he ever faced good was GGG and Floyd’ other then all trash
I am glad, he won by KO, so the haters can save their silly arguments that Canelo stole the fight,  paid the judges, cheated, etc.
Le dolió más el sape que le dió su compañero
Everybody dick riding canelo 😂
Now this is commentary. Viva Mexico!!! Undisputed Champion!!!!. None of the DAZN shit.
Y q que va a decir Mhony vdente le fallo gacho
How to sell a dive in three steps ... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Canelo Alvarez put on a show.  He always does.
Y’all must of forgot what Floyd did to that boy
PLANT Got The "REACH" Advantage But He Lacks The "POWER PUNCH COMBINATION", "STAMINA", & "DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES". I Keep On Waiting For A "POWER PUNCH COMBINATION" From Him Because He Has The "REACH" Advantage But He Had Never Thrown A Great Power Punch Combination. PLANT'S "LACK OF POWER PUNCHES" Was The Main Reason He Lost The Fight.
Say what you want, Canelo is great, but Mayweather beat him. Canelo took the fight against Mayweather and Mayweather won. So what does that say? 👍👍👍
Jake paul thinks he can beat canelo😂
It was a fairly competitive fight  in the earlier rounds.  Canelo  wasn’t especially sharp last night and still managed to get him out of there.  Respect to both these warriors.
Extremely boring fight
Congratulations clownelo
Greatest Boxer of our generation. PERIOD.
Canelo collecting belts like thanos collecting infinity stones
He is the next chaves
Best Irish, i mean Mexican fighter EVER!!!!💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Le partió la madre lo sabía este hombre no. Tiene rival
Who will be next...
Dam it
Another trash talk has gone wrong compilation beast
Saw this coming lol we all knew this was going down
Canelo started slow, plant was doing decent in the first 6 rounds, but canelo always ends up finishing hard, I watched the fight and noticed plant was aggressive in the first 3 rounds, he was throwing way more then canelo, sure he was only landing like 2 out of 6 but still he did better then I thought, I want to see canelo and Keith one time Thurman ,
CONGRATULATIONS to the P4P undisputed, unified, SMW Champion, Canelo Alvarez!!! But there was no losers tonight, both fighters won, even in defeat, Caleb impressed me with his performance, because to be honest, I didn't have much respect for Caleb Plant as a boxer, or his boxing skills, but after watching the fight, Caleb made a fan out of me, and proved to me he's solid, and a real one. Respect to both men, for both men giving and showing respect afterward.
Just 4 1 day notice now nothing no boxing only offers fantastic dancing show Hollywood boxing
If he didn't get ko plant would of won clearly....plant needed to hold more
Horrible acting by Caleb! What a Fraud canelo is!
Now why won't  Canelo fight black fighters or Mexican fighters anymore is that what I'm hearing
Canelo landed every shot he wanted to hit mayweather with..that philly shell is only mastered by mayweather.. but plant did an awesome job.. canelo is just too strong..
No es verdad
Sometimes I think canelo gets annoyed when his opponents go down like he was bout ready to give more combos
Lmfao @.45  coach slaps canelo
I thank mayweather for canelo being this great
Fucking ppl ringside watching this KO on 5 inch screen instead of right in front of them…
The Coronation is Complete! Viva 🤴 King Canelo and Viva 🇲🇽 Mexico🥊💯🤸‍♀️
I was one of the people who didn't think Plant had a chance but he gave a good account of himself in my opinion. Alvarez is just a monster. Great fight tho.
Being patient and listening to his corner was the key to this fight for Canelo, excellent performance and his numbers put him on the best on Mexican history.
Man Tim Bradley predicted that first knockdown with 100% accuracy
Mexican power
This man went from selling popsicles in the streets of mexico to being a legend in the sport of boxing. Hats off to you champ!
Canelo wasn't playing around he had said this was personal look at plant all over the floor 😂
I thought Canelo "appeared" ineffective against Plant for most of the fight. I could have seen a draw, or even a plant win on points. But then again it wouldnt be pout of sorts to see a Canelo win on points
Can’t lie Though Plant did his thing too
Ref: you wanna fight  Plant: yeEeAaa(no)aAAa
Guess white boy wasn't ready for "chingasos" haha  Great job Canelo 👍🏾
I'm glad I didn't pay for this fight
So many steroids
What happened to everyone saying Plant would win ?
Good morning everyone! I thought I was dreaming last night. Such a good fight
Now we just need Floyd to comeback and Bring Canelo Back to Earth.😏🤓
I FEEL  CANELO HAS LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT BOXING THROUGHOUT THE YEARS... HE IS COMING FOR THE THRONE
well atleast plants only loss was by the best of his era
S/O Mexico 🇲🇽 no need to be racist to each other black and brown people
Ain’t nobody beating calling right now! Nobody! He is the face of boxing!
Man all that shit talking for nothing viva Mexico 🇲🇽 cabrones
Canelo shimming to finish Caleb cracks me up
Always hurt by canelos power he knew he never had a chance. Sitting duck
Canelo: The Money’s already been Wired to your Account. Plant: Yeah Bro? Canelo: Yeah man, I learned that Winning Tactic from Floyd. Just cough up some Cash and you’ll always win. Plant: Thanks brother, I needed the Cash. Canelo: Don’t mention it, at De End of the Day, De Only Losers are all these Stupid People,  the Folks that Paid the Paper View, and Audiences that Lose. But Us… We’ll Always be the Winners.
Canelo only started fighting in the 11th lol whole fight he fought at 50%
Plant looked exceptional cause Canelo had no respect for his power.. Canelo came in taking risk and  throwing power shots expecting to be countered and hit alot...haven't seen him fight like that since the first fight with Triple G.. had to be terrifying for Plant when he throws his hardest punches and Canelo just keeps coming forward landing crushing blows
STOP DUCKING Benavidez
Not to take anything away from Plant, but GAWDDAMN Canelo was on fire.
Y’all really excited he beat Caleb plant? Y’all knew he was a buster from the jump. 🤣🤣
King CANELO CABRONES!!!!
I like Canelo but damn I wish the American had won
Bravo canelo por reventar a ese bocasa 👏👏👏👏👏
What song is that in the back with the horns in it 🔥
Now that Canelo has beat all the trashcans in the division let's see him against Andrade, bivol, Charlo, benvidez.
Fotn was Gaethje vs Chandler. Ko otn was Canelo. Fight fans had a good night
Great fight, too bad that announcer is a complete tool.
Canelo. Is amazing. But needs to fight glovkin again... he lost then. And will and would lose again.
Who says Steroids don't Work ! Canelo just showed you how Steroids Work ! Thank you Steroids !
Canelo is full of violence speed and momentum!!!! VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽!!!!!
Caleb is a c level fighter he ain’t no good fighter at all
Who’s next, Goku you know what let’s bring the Wolverine in to the mix.
Caleb survived! BJS  hit Canelo Clean a couple of times and was more competitive.  Caleb only jabbed the whole time and never really hit Canelo Clean. Canelo face was clean like if he never got hit at all.
The whole world knew Plant would get the fuck knocked out, this is no surprise.
Canelo Alvarez is the Baddesr  man on the planet
Canelo vs may weather part 2 ?
Song??
Caleb fought like a coward the whole fight backing up and holding canelos gloves but he actually came out to fight in the 11th and look at what happened 😭
And that’s why Andre Ward retired because he knew is time was coming he had to face Canelo You seen that uppercut
What is next for canelo? The man just going to keep climbing the ladder in weight ? Maybe fight fury ?
Thats what happens when you diss a badass mexican boxer. Motherfuckers wannna run all that ying yang then  get knocked the fuck out
Mad mad respect to plant. Nothing to be ashamed of. U did your daughter proud. I’m sure she was looking down from heaven.
canelo  orguyo mexicano orguyo  guanatus papa   mexico tiene alos mejores boxeadores ahuevo
If you've never seen T-1000 from Terminator 2, Canelo is the real life version.
If he could've beat Mayweather he would've went down as the 🐐
Benevidez next up to bat!
When they start 🏃 you know it's time too end it!!# salute to both men!!!!
didnt look like he hit him with anything devastating, looked more like plant was worn out.
Never under estimate the power of the Canelo🥊🇲🇽🥊🇲🇽🥊🇲🇽🥊🇲🇽
I still want to hear 👂  his dum ec Xcuses
Roids for the win 🥇
Canelo a beast 💪
The unofficial scorecard was absolute bullshit. That was a pretty even fight up until the end.
Caleb is really good..
Plant is trash anyway 🤣, no one is surprised by this outcome though it was a lil boring for the first half.
Canelo got that last combo from Errol Spence when he ko kell brook😁😁😁
U want payday told y’all fuck plant 🌱
Poor tall bitch,he was still knocked out from canelos first punch at the presentation a month ago 😆
What did you say about my mom??? Canelo made him pay
Caleb uproots plant! Explosive fight. Great video. Thanks
Time for bivol or beterbiev.. only competition out there
QUE VERGÜENZA Y DISE QUE ES EL MEJOR LIBRA X LIBRA .. ES UN ASCO EL CANELO . YA LES E DICHO QUE NO ES BOXEADOR...PELEA COMO EL MASETON CABRERA ... ES EL PAPA DE CANELO
IF caleb wouldn't have pissed off canelo, his faith could have been that of Callum Smith.  Sure get beat up, but still not given a beat down and getting KO'd.. WHen will this fighters realize that Canelo is on a different level mentally.. when you piss him off it's gonna cause him to go into killer mode.
actually canelo was losing look at his face
He did say "YOURE GANNA SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT" and boy we did RIP PLANT
First thing I thought was "Prime Tyson", especially with that hook. Damn. Boxing's back!!
Canelo is the best bro, But long live Money Mayweather
Peds it's becoming a joke and their ruining boxing just let the. Use everything then so they'll all be built like super heros and the guys who don't use are in for trouble.
hehe you goooot Knocked the F Out!! and you knw thisss mane! 🇲🇽🇺🇲🇲🇽🇺🇲🇲🇽🇺🇲🇲🇽
Who’s knows maybe Plant will learn a lot from this fight and become just like how canelo is now. Just like how canelo lost to mayweather. But canelo ain’t no mayweather tho lol
Well plant said will see November 6 we sure did canelo do strong bro
Bring on the Charlo brothers
Just another night’s work for Canelo. Pound for pound best fighter in the world right now.
What this fight proved was that not even on Canelo’s best day he could beat Mayweather. Plant, is not even half the boxer May is, had Canelo hitting air and gassed out with the shoulder roll. Fight was much closer than the judges cards suggest.
Canelo beats Floyd if fought tomorrow
This shit is rigged lol
He the King Of Boxing .
Get that poor man's his sunglasses,  he going to need it for his new swollen face, also call a chiropractor, he probably has his head and neck out of place.
Remember when Cownelo used to gas out? Well, not anymore. Now he gets stronger. Superman ! ! ! : ))
There are some people you never meet or know in person but they earn your respect.  It happens a few times.  To me, Canelo is one of them.  He fights for something more than money in my head.  That’s what makes him a winner and a good teacher.
Who's next, Charlo or Benavidez ? Can I get an AMEN 🙏for the new Undisputed Champ Canelo Alvarez!
MAN JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW GOOD FLOYD IS
Went longer then billy jo to be real man billy jo vs plant a b a good fight cuz ain’t nobody ready for Canelo right now
That's why plant got sweet hands. No power
Canelo the goat 🐐
Plant w 12 rounds w a great tht shows how great floyd is he was the only one to beat em
He wanted to fight canelo
Eddy told him to use that upper and plant when he wpuld duck would alwaya go to the same postion damn eddy
I turned off after 5 round Caleb was using right hand just left jab can't win with one hand
ATG !👑👑👑👑👑
Planted him right on the ground huh?!?
X fin se acabo el circo de estos 2 payasos gracias ya no se va a saturar la red con estos farsantes
It's time for canelo to step up benevidez is ready
Lol he’s doing this shit to Europeans  & white boys Fight Charlo & take the drug test stop
HAHAHAHA. What's up BIGTALK?????
Eddie reynoso was happy asf jumping inside that ring just shows what this fight meant for them
Ref - “Wanna fight” Plant “yeah”.Proceeds to swallow punches and gets knocked out…. He was done after the first knockdown
Wen you do santing like cleaning grass with you hard you get great things we this man lives inside the Jim hi has beef for 3 more easy cuando un mexicano es cabron asta en el trabajo se ve el gallo
Canelo is a beast💪
Mexico Raza  orale
Canelo,canelo,canelo yes great job
As canelo said after this fight you won’t be the same,good work canelo 🇲🇽👏🏻
Practice 😎🥊
Great fight! Canelo was amazing as always, he is magnificent to watch, what a class boxer. Plant was tough, his defense was great and he ate some shots that would have put most boxers to sleep. But in the end Canelo was something else as always. Plant should be proud of his performance.
Caleb was doing a good  fight in some round he make canelo look like shit, but against the ropes ,hands down and that shoulder mayweather style it wasn't for him he should stay in the middle of the ring making miss making pay and keep using that long jab.good fight.
Caleb... your eating your words now. Not good to bark.... its a show of immaturity and weakness.  Canelo smelled it a mile away. Viva mexico 🇲🇽 cabrones
Caleb flopped
Ginger Mexican strikes again
Wow wow WOW!
So much for that unbeaten streak…
Great job Canelo. The European tour is over with. Time to focus on Charlo and Benevidez...
0:25 Canelos little run has me dying
Canelo went straight Golovkin on Plant!
It’s crazy how much better Canelo is than all his competition. Obviously it’s not possible, but if it was, does a prime Floyd beat this version of Canelo?
Ya dejate caer wuey la los Borregos ya kieren gritar
Proud to be Mexican 🌮🌯
Look like me and my brother fighting 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
I’m happy Chepo Reynoso got to witness the culmination of a great legacy which he witnessed since the beginning.  “Valió la pena vivir, valió la pena existir” - Chepo Reynoso
Such a good fight, Plant was competitive but I don't think he had Canelo in any real trouble and then Canelo did what Canelo does time and time again.
NO SOY MEXICANO PERO SIEMPRE APOYO A  LA RAZA LATINA,
Now fight a real champion like Benavides. He didn't earn the WBC belt, it was a gift from the WBC by fight a unknown guy coming off a loss. Benavides loss tge belt on the scales. Let's see if Canelo is a true champion by fighting the real beast at super Middle weight.
This the guy Floyd beat the shit out of right?
Canelo is amazing too bad boxing is so tainted with cheating I will always wonder about every single fight every time
Pinche pelea vale verga ni la sangre se sacan.
Them 24/7’s have you think these “other fighters” really have a chance….cudo’s to whoever started those. Great promo.
Sweet hands sweet dreams!!!
I think fake Paul has a shot here
History was made!! 🔥
NEVER TRADE MEXICAN WARRIOR OR YOU WILL BE DESTROYED LIKE THIS BUG 😂
Que raro calló Caleb!  Canelo eres grande!👏👏👏
RIP BOZO
Seeing Tyson in the background taking it all in is surreal.
Floyd could never
"Is there no one else!" They way he got on those ropes. Troy moment for sure. Hes an animal
Can I get an AMEN 🙏for the new Undisputed Champ Canelo Alvarez vs Caleb Plant...Who's next? Charlo or Benavidez
Plant real quiet now!
Caleb 💀 R.i.P 💀
Yall really think it was plant that went 11 rounds.. na cinnamon punished this man and didn't want a 12 round. VIVA LA RAZA!
CANELO ALVAREZ THE BEST CHAMPION ,
Canelo is a great fighter.
Just the best
Aw man…..Canelo fights different when upset…..
Plant couldn’t take the power
Needs a belt guy….he can’t even carry the belts
Canelo the peoples champion. We love canelo USA LOVES CANELO
Caleb ran to the corner help help i think he broke my eye socket 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Caleb covid 19 : Canelo ya con 3 vacunas
Caleb has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Great fight. That’s just what happens when you fight the best fighter in boxing.
Glad I chose to watch real fights !
💉💊💉💊💉💊
Exactly what everyone knew was going to happen. Señor Alvarez is the best.
Caleb had no chance never did anything significant in the fight all he did was survive  for as long as he could hiding behind his defense
Boring!
ese vato fue 1 costal de papas
Whole time watching this Plant wouldn’t put his fucking hands up. Canelo had hella solid shots on his face that I thought should’ve knocked him out a long time ago in all honesty plant was eating them hoes for a while but u don’t cover ur face get hit in the face that many rounds it’s gonna affect you eventually. Plant could’ve lasted if he did shit differently
how this same dude lose to floyd ????
Caleb didn't even stand a chance against the Mexican warrior. I heard Floyd trained him , but still lost
The fight was over when he bloodied plant at the press conf😐🤣
You got some ppl saying this was a bad stoppage they should have let him die smh fuckin casuals
Canelo is unstoppable, there is just nobody that can handle him. All my respect for Caleb, I'm sure that he will learn from this fight. Viva México cabrones!!!
Canelo was expected to win. What makes Canelo one of a kind is his timing on the ring. Amazing!    But Caleb Plant put up a great fight. He will get back up from this fight and be the 7th person to unify these belts in the future!    Mayweather never lost but he fought a 21 year old Canelo and despite having the advance of having more experience and being in his prime, he never knocked down canelo.
That punch got Charlo wife jumping like .... Are you sure you want this?
Can't fck with my boi
Canelo made it look so easy I swear he didn’t have to do much he cut the ring walked him down never had to really chase him it was simple walking and landing the heat. Easier fight than Saunders
😂😂😂😂😂😂! Eggplant Tácos,I meant Caléb Plant Tácos Al Pastór! 😂😂 😂
Fuck PBC boxing. Let their fighters cancel each other out then take the last one standing out. You can see they trained Plant. Good defense but what about the offense?!!!
Makes you think how strong gggs chin really is
🏃 💨 👈 canelo vs black fighter
steriods peds the truth boo boo would fuck him up
So everyone here just to suck off Canelo?
so refreshing to see an actual audience again...
I hate this referee. Please don’t let him call another major fight
The fix was in for 11th Rd KO
what a fight 🥵 canelo a fucking beast!!!!!! 👏
When talking trash goes wrong!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🥊🥊
It’s very rare I see a white Mexican and to see more indigenous Hispanics cheering him on is pretty cool.
🏆🏆🏆🏆
Why do they never use their waist to hold some of the belts???
He chopped that tree down💪🏿💪🏿
People always talked about Mayweather picking lesser opponents. This guy is worst he picked the easiest division to unify. Fight Charlo
Im starting to not like Canelo Hes getting too big for his Britches.... Com on TANK  YOU CAN DO IT   Ve Va  Ve va  Shut up
After I saw Caleb Plant bouncing around in round 1 & 2 I knew he would get fatigued really fast. After he landed his first solid blow on canelo I looked at my wife and told her it was over. He didn't have nearly enough power to demand any respect from Canelo
F. YEAAAAH WHO IS YOUR DADDY. CALEB HAHAHAHAHA. PAY BACK IS A B@TCH
Plant looks just like that pathetic comedian Screech from Saved by the Bell went the same way as him tonight and WTF is up with those ridiculous trunks??? He talked a big game but could not deliver!!!!
Still don't like him never have Either
Canelo is a bad man. Only lost is to the GOAT floyd.
The KING! 👑🇲🇽🔥🇲🇽
Floyd don't want any of this 2nd time. Skin of his teeth he survived.
He think cause he got a beard it’ll make him a better fighter 😏🤣🤣 you ain’t gonna beat that Mexican macho man 🤣 he hit too hard. Maybe Caleb would have a chance after a few cases of beer maybe 🤷🏾‍♂️
Next up light heavy weights
Amazing!  What a champion.
Canelo whole camp on the 🧃🥤 💉 and everybody knows it.
Canelo el undisputed mas muerto de today la hysteria de Mexico un hombre con 20 peleas Canelo con casi 60 y le duro 11 rounds un muelto
Wtf are the charlo Brothers? I want canelo to beat their asses
Horse meat vs Deer meat! It hits different!
Plant had no chance lmao since the press conference
Why does mike Tyson have a spotlight on him in the background 😂😂
Con ese flavor todo espatao y Canelo se tardy 11 asaltos con ese flacucho
he should of said no when they asked if he wants to keep fighting
Canelo Unstopable!!!
I put 250$ on plant going past 10.  My man.  🙏!!!!  Nelo is P4P before this so I dunno if he really proved anything he hasn’t already.  He’s a HOF first ballot no contest 😂.  He’s gonna have to fight Bud or, Fury to prove anything else at this point.  Yeah, he’s that good.
Undisputed. Na he has a lost!!!!
All the idiots hating on canelo and calling him a steroid cheat 🤣🤣 you mean how he voluntarily agreed to a drug test for GGG part 2, and does come back positive for “trace amounts of clenbuterol” which is happens more often than you’d think due to meat contamination in Mexico. Now this is where we use common sense ( and I know that’s hard for y’all) but who in their right mind would agree to a drug test if they were actively cheating? 🤔🤔🥱🥱 same shit from the same idiots who can’t stand to see canelo win every time he adds another belt to the collection
He passed up Mayweather's record he got all the belts in and for weight divisions he cleaned out one way division in one year four belts one year nobody has did that yet as a Latino there are four others who had cleaned out for weight divisions also
Okay, now I'm convinced that Canelo would absolutely obliterate Andrade!
Gotta give Caleb props he’s a damn good fighter but he lost concentration and we saw who was the better man
Called it
0:44 reynoso slaps canelo on the back of the head
It's was a good fight. Congratulations too Alvarez.
I didn’t even know they fought last night. I was watching UFC
ANOTHER FUCKIN NOBODY
Good job canelo 👍🏾 you figured out how to beat white opponents! A CLEAN sweep of European fighters!
But did he beat Mayweather?
That’s what happens when you talk $hit Plant!
My abuelitos favorite boxer was canelo n he always wanted to see him become the undisputed champion I’m sad he’s not here to see it but I’m blessed canelo could make my abuelito happy
You know Canelo was like “ no juuu da mutttafuukkkaaa”.
Plant fought the wrong fight
El Rey Canelo
Man fight charlo, benavidez ,or Andrade he keep fighting white boys for a reason
Once it was realized that Plant could not hurt Canelo--it was a matter of time.  Canelo walked him down the entire fight.  "Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth"--MT
Classes Joe Frazier left hook executed perfectly
Yo the party I was at went bananas when Canelo won ! Haha awesome night.. thank you Canelo for the memories
El que niegue que CANELO ES UN GRAN CAMPEÓN...es porque habla más por envidia..que por aceptar la calidad de este gran CAMPEÓN  VIVA!! MÉXICO!!
🥱🥱
The king 🤴 of kings 💯🇲🇽
“Get out the red panties, baby! Canelo made us rich!… and momma, you get a brand NEW double-wide” - Caleb plant Now he can fade into obscurity (hopefully)… so fake
King Canelo!!
Floyd gots to come out of retirement an show this man who the greatest fighter really is.
Plant shouldn't feel too bad about himself. He did better than alot of other people
Plant looked like a b*tch lmao he was scared as hell.
I thought it was kind of messed up they didn't let Caleb try to get up on a 10 count😌😏 also the refery was pushing Caleb way out into the middle of the ring when Canelo was on the ropes many times in the later rounds . Giving him space to recover .  Another thing I had Caleb winning rounds 1 through 5 by points and then Canelo winning round 6 .  Judges only had  Caleb winning 2 rounds. Just goes to show you that you can have the edge in boxing more ways than one . Because they know if he would have won, a lot of people would have lost a lot of money . So he had the referee against him . He had the bookies against him . He had the crowd against him , also he had the commentators with judges against him. Wow ! Congratulations Canelo on making history . ⛳ time to play golf a😃
I’d say Canelo is a Mexican warrior, we see his story as great biographical landmark in those whom are seen as weak but can come back as a champion
I honestly feel this was a sold Fight, I saw the fight yesterday. You can see Canelo punching him hard, and Plant was just throwing jabs, did not see him try hard punches on him.   It's so sad.   Yes I'm a Canelo Fan
Real fights.not fixed fights like gayweather.real champ
Messing with the Mexican thunder is not a good idea
Still couldn’t beat Floyd though.
Canelo is the champion.
That's for opening your pie hole player.😏😁
No one can ever talk ish about Canelo cherry picking. He literally earned all the belts in his division. Congrats undisputed champ! 🍾🥂
canelo alvarez is a monster in the ring man 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Great fight... Caleb has to be more aggressive and let his hands go more. Canelo is a pressure power puncher and is a monster with it....
Canelo is a Animal in that ring. They better stop playing with him.
Viva Mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
I just feel like it was rigged canelo was looking tired and not even winning but all of a sudden in round 11 Caleb start loosing terribly when he ain look tired of nothing and was doing really good man foh😂
Canelo was just getting warmed up !
Plant was legit running away all fight lol
Good fight
Love to reading all the haters comments, they just make me laugh and good candidates for clown school 🤡. Canelo just keeps being the goat 🐐🤫.
You can run but you can’t hide!!💪🏽
Mayweather....
Latinos Victory!!!
Paratodos qe ablaban del canelo una bes mas les cayo labaca bamos canelo fanatico numero uno
Plant went for the grapple and canelo said get the fuck off me bitch bamm!
He planted that ass on the ground
Y realmente era boxeador ese señor??
And Jake Paul thinks he can beat canelo
Theirs levels to this shit
🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Now go fight charlo
What was that?? " write my words" ??? 😂😂😂😂
The plant isn’t growing in Canelos garden.
Late stoppage imo
Do Mexicans love Canelo? Or do they hate the fact that he is white and challenging Chavez for the title of greatest Mexican fighter ?
Canelo you are the man congratulations  brother
Blah blah blah fight benevidez point blank period the real boogyman
Canelo was mad asf
And Jake wants to fight him .... 😂 Jake Paul needs to rewatch this fight about a million times cuz there are million reasons to why he should never be allowed. #CongratsCanelo👊🥊💯
Nasty uppercuts sheesh 🙄
Honestly I am surprise  he ( canelo) knock Him out in the 11 ROUND it should have been earlier.
I give a lot of respect to plant , canelo is just a super fighter to me with his las 5 performances he is now on top of the great Julio Cesar Chávez
You can even say plant got planted into the ground
This could be Ryan Garcia but he just in it for the clout
A moment of silence to all the suckers that actually paid to watch this fight…
You have to give it to plant. Dude went the distance. I really believe had he would have bought himself time he would have made it to the 12th round
F**k canelo he hasn't fought no real fighter? Ans when he did he looked stupid? They keep setting him up with a bunch of nobody's? He's a bit** in my book? And will never be a true Mexican?
Roids
Also Canelo figured out how to beat Boxers who like to dance in the Ring Hold Em still and beat the shit outta them.
Caleb took a beating to his right face the whole fight leaving it wide open, I seen a TKO long before coming from  Canelo left hook 💪🏼
el gran campeon  Saul canelo alvares. 🔥🔥💯 un orgullo .  No matter  who  he beats  haters are gonna hate...
That is right.. KING CANELO.
Had Canelo not fought Mayweather and was undefeated he would be 5x bigger than he is now. But because of that fight nobody outside of hardcore boxing fans and Mexicans care much about him.
After watching this a couple times. how tfffffff is caleb plant getting knocked the EXACT same was as BJS. ducks the head down straight into the uppercut just like BJS
Finally some real boxing instead of that influencer shit. THANK YOU!!!!!!!
I felt there had to be a Clause in that Contract the stopped Canelo from laying him out before the 9th
So many people saying rigged, Canelo bodies him and those punches were hard and his legs were gone. Dude was exhausted. After the second knockdown you can see when Caleb sat up it took all he had to just sit up. You can’t fake that. Rewatch.
charlo is next
Scrolling through the comments looking for a Canelo hater , where y’all at 👀🙅🏻‍♂️
Canelo is a late round champion he studies the first 3 rounds
CA!!! Viva la raza
Pero así esto mexicanitoz ganan si el separó y el abrito ni contó tenía contarle asta 10 aver si el podía seguir por eso que ganan siempre esto mojaditos pongan ready tenemos 4 Dominicanos que vienen por estos Palomitos viva santo domingo vamos Aser los mejores fortuna lla ledio pela amitas desto ropa mojada haaaaaa
Canelo TBE!!
Easy work for canelo .. I rlly wanna see a canelo vs floyd again that’s his only comp in my opinion floyd is still a goat
Canelo is a Beast he gave plant a ass whipping with that knockout ..vicious knockout after the first knockdown canelo hunting him down like a hungry tiger ..lights out
damn his first knockdown canelo 100% accuracy with all 3 punches!!!
Unbeatable Canelo Strong punch powerful long way to go,.Saludos a todos los latinos desde Lima PERU
Canelo played with his food for 10 rounds and then he went for the kill, I know that was his plan to end it at the 11 round because he was fighting different then he usually does until the 11th round came, it was obvious ....
Dude is a demon
klab is a joke as a fighter , he ran the whole fight and the first good punch from cannelo  he folded and got knocked out ,  klab  was not a worthy opponent for cannelo  congratulations cannelo is the best figher out there
Except for the TKO it was pretty dull, I mean Plant threw more punches at the weight in. It was Canelo setting the pace and Plant counter punching. Not one of the best title fights!
GOAT that's all I got to say🤦🥊
Identical to the uppercut he put on BJS
Steroids. It does a body good lol!
Props to Caleb, that man can boxe. There’s just levels to this sport. Experience, talent, technique and straight up mindset. Viva Mexico 🇲🇽🥇
Mis felicitaciones Canelo,nos distes otra alegria mas...You are the king...saludos de un 🇨🇱!
To all my fellow Americans se vergiaron a Plant sheeeshhhhh 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Who all knew it was just a matter of time before canelo hurt that dude?.
Asi sele quita lo ozicon a los bocones arriva mexico y canelo decir canelo es decir mexico
Damn plant went way further then i thought he would can't wait to see how he bounces back, but canelo had it i knew he'd get it congrats 👏👍
So many belts he can’t even carry them all.. his punches are way to powerful. Plant has his guard up and still felt the force…unbelievable
CANELO LIKE
I don't see anyone beating him he's the best
Canelo is a fucking cheater fuck that man get GGG back
King Canelo! .....mayweather who.....
Viva Mexico Cabrones!! 🇲🇽🇲🇽
🇲🇽🇲🇽 sports
CP and CA gave us a fight of the year I think. Great job CP and great job CA. "VIVA MEXICO"
A pagar señores
Mama Mia!
This is how much faith I had I canelo lol put $150 down on the man and didn’t even watch the fight cuz I knew he was gonna win ☠️☠️😂😂😂😂
So sad he couldn't take on Mayweather.
For all the guys saying to rematch mayweather Folks stop dreaming he would make mayweather ground beef right now lol the guy has ko a light heavy weight won belts in classes mayweather never dreamed of doing because he picked and chose his fights. I was not a Canelo fan because he lost to my cuban Lara and they stole that fight but he has become a monster both in offense and defense. Enjoy whats left of him he is p4p now.
Props to canelo I knew he was gonna win but I hate his fucking fan base idk what’s up with Mexicans and there sports fan base but they are so fucking toxic even the Mexican soccer teams fan base is fucking toxic maybe it’s the culture . Plant without a doubt won a lot of those rounds. this wasn’t a easy fight for canelo and the people acting like plant sucks dude literally dominated canelo in some rounds. Learn how to read boxing plant did very well it’s just canelo caught him slipping and finished it. Both of them are world class boxers give plant his props this was canelos hardest fight recently
Bro I went bonkers when he knocked him out but aye props to caleb plant he also did his job in there!!
Canelo undisputedly the best ✊🏼
I don’t understand why people doubt my boy canelo smh 🤦‍♂️
The opposition he fought to get the belts is B+ because the whole time he was avoiding Charlo, Andrade and Benavidez. Granted Benavidez lost his belt over drug use but I can say right now, Canelo would have never fought at 168 be it for Benavidez losing that belt for two reasons, one “Canelo doesn’t want to fight Mexicans.” 🤣🤣 Two, because Benavidez would have wiped the floor with him. I remember us real boxing fans was like damn Canelo you gonna let Benavidez stop you from being undisputed? 🤣🤣🤣 You gonna let Charlo stop you from being undisputed? They made a whole new belt for Canelo to duck Charlo and he told Andrade, “You want payday, I know that... You fought no-one.” But yet look at Plants resume, I can tell you now Andrades is better. Ya’ll feed off what they will give you and if you were true fans of the sport you would be screaming for Canelo to fight Charlo, Benavidez and Andrade. He is not undisputed yet if you look at the politics of the sport book. He has not fought the best in 168.
The greatest Mexican boxer of all time is a Red headed white man. #SomethingtoDiscuss
canelo is wide open...soon he will run into something
Mexico is gloriuos in boxing.
This came down to conditioning... Canelo has had A-1 conditioning since his loss to Floyd. Canelo just periodically chopped him down while dragging Plant to the deep end. As he said... Levels to this
Canelo is the 🐐
Mi predicion fue peferta. Congratulecion campion
Poor Caleb! After he got up from that first knock down it was like a little kid running from his daddy to avoid a beat down lol! Boxing is a pure sport, man to man in the ring, Caleb couldn’t back up that tuff talk!
KING CANELO, HERE TO STAY AND CONQUER 👑😈
Now fight a black fighter or two maybe andre ward ?
I'm an island boy
Remember Canelo was also somewhat pissed that night. Lol But all credit to CANELO "The King" is the best right now. Give credit where credit is due.
Canelo: Now reality can be whatever I want
Poison Diablo Uppercut drop Plant good Yoda says .
Let’s go Mayweather! It’s time for the rematch.
Did you see how Canelos trainer came up and smacked him in the back of the head and Canelos reaction? Canelo was human trafficked to Mexico as an infant and forced to train as a boxer just so Mexico could have a champ 💯.
The crowds roar is incredible
So are we starting the goat conversation for Mexicans? Or he has more to do? Usman couldn't handle this power and pressure
Hahaha plant thought he had a chance
¡Viva Mexico!  🇲🇽 You are the best Canelo 🔥
Thats what happens if you’re cocky and no respect with your opponent.good job Canelo ☝️👍
Why wasn't Caleb throwing power punches?
Its funny when they say canelo doesnt fight any good fighters when all of his opponents were all champs or undefeated in the ring until they go against canelo he just makes it look easy because of how good he is, stop hating on a great fighter and appreciate that we have a once in a generation fighter 😂🤣
Floyd Mayweather is > Canelo
Can’t say I didn’t expect this
Ahí están sus logros !nice!
This is so fake and scripted those punches didn't even connect well and were not thrown hard I guarantee you if some no name threw those same punches it wouldn't even phase plant lol it's scripted and fake!
Damn
Canelo was polite to let the fight go that many rounds. Can’t wait to find out what Plant was saying in the ring during the middle rounds. Chirp chirp.
And jake paul thinks he could beat him 🤣
Surpassed Mayweather career
no trae nada canelo el rey es marques awebo
The truth is, Canelo is being protected by his handlers from fighting black champions. Everyone knows this who knows boxing. The facts are Mexican (champs) boxers, are being protected by white rich owners in collaboration with their Mexicans managements. "The Powers That Be" don't want to see, the continuation of black dominance in the sports for the last 65 years black men have dominated the sport of boxing in spite of Mexican success in the hidden racism against the black man. Canelo will never be a true champion because he only fight white European fighters he's the best time for pound fighter against white Europeans not necessarily against Mexicans and he's sure not against black men and this is the truth racism is so ugly and nasty that even the Mexicans thrive off it when it's against the black man!
Canelo can keep the power in the later rounds because of steroids. He' been busted for it before and his whole camp.
Knew it I knew canelo would get the job done he trains and prepares easy work
Only a show to steal your money 💰 I’m Mexican and canelo sucks why he didn’t defeat mayweather
FAKE!!
All eyes on Canelo, his time to shine!! Sensational victory
TBE!!!
Respect to Caleb..he did well
Where’s all that shyt he was talking?
Deberían actuar en la rosa de Guadalupe falsa 💯💯💯
How did he lose against Mayweather??? Fake champ.
The greatest!!!
#boxingsstillrigged. At least make it look good I mean c'mon all the sudden plant forgets how to move #bullshit.
Lol Eddy smacked Canelo in back of the dad like a proud dad when he got on the ropes.
Caleb was talkin all that shit but started running when shit got real
Opie wins.
First off that stat count was straight cap Caleb landed way more and made canelo miss way more canelo did what he does best and got plant out of there but if he didn’t the best they could of get canelo to save his legacy was a draw or a L but canelo did what he does best and stopped dude
Canelo hit him in vestibular then pushes him to set up that packed uppercut. Just brilliant
Wow who won?
🐐
PED started to kick in after the 6 round
Dam BRING BACK FLOYD!!!!
Canelo had one of the greatest boxing minds.  He figured out what Plant was all about and then put in a clinic.
Canelo is THE GOAT. You cannot deny it now. Talk about Floyd's undefeated record all you want, but to me, Canelo's resume is MUCH more impressive. This guy makes it look real easy.
Those uppercuts are timed with such precision did the same to billy joe
King Canelo ???? I love how white people totally dismiss the fact this man got beat by the real king Floyd Mayweather when Canelo
Canelo did what he said he was going to do and he also got all the belts congratulations 🍾👍🏽💯🔥🇲🇽
both did hella great but canelo just had everything on kaleb!
Don't talk about his mom.
Plant punked out.  Let's see Andre Ward come out of retirement 💪🏾
I tip my cap to plant,  he came to fight. He's probably in his head right now analyzing what mistakes he made or what he could have done differently. I cant fault him for losing to canelo bc he is in a class by himself
Awesome fight, Plant was doing great until that happened! Well worth the cash, I bought PBC over the UFC, man!
What about the highlights of caleb before the ko
Next time dont talk bout his mama 🤣🤣🤣
Another fix fight lol
Just as I figured.   Hard to stop Canelo.
I don’t think most people realize canelo had a really bad fight. He made a ton of mistakes early fighting emotional trying to rip plants head off, he didn’t turn it on til the 9/10th
Ayo plant got fucked up
The real question is.....who the hell is next? Canelo is cleaning house. Dude is a beast.
Why they pick such easy fights for Canelo he fights all tomato cans since he LOST to Floyd 🤷🏾‍♂️
King 👑 CANELO thats it he has done ✅ it All"!!!!! He is the Past Present and Future of Boxing 🥊 like luv or hate it that's what it is"!!!! He has nothing more else to prove if he wants to fight David Benevediz or Jermall Charlo that's entirely up to him. I would luv to see it but even if he does or doesn't what more else who else he is the raining undefeated supreme champion undefeated and now Undisputed"!!!!!
Canelo ducks the real fighters to go against bums, fight Bud Crawford you coward
I absolutely loved how Canelo came running and weaving towards Plant like a cartoon monster stalking his prey to definitively finish him. 👹👏 👏
Fakeeeeeeeeee
White Boyd was taking Ls all day this year 😂
That belt…. It’s bad A..
Plant talked a good talk but we all knew wat was gone happen
Plant was really trying to shoulder roll canelo all night, 😂good effort
Canelo is the king
and yet no one cares…….. we were all watching UFC. Thanks for the youtube feed. Oh, and he lost to GGG. Fraud sport.
I dont think nobody beats canelo canelo can retire with a wonderful record only 1 lose and thats to Mayweather and hes the best fighter in world congratts Canelo.Mexico🥊💪🏻
If only Floyd what’s available for canelo now 🙏 wow  🤩
Canelo 💪
Plant shoulder roll made canelo miss alot. I dont he was going to win by points, canelo was the agressor the whole night, with power punches.
Canelo, Tyson and Tito best finishers ever in the sport!
Gotta thank the PED as always .
Canelo to Plant: "You will pay..." And pay he did. Canelo let him stay there every round, 1st-2nd-3rd-4th-5th-6th-7th-8th-9th-10th. Plant thought he has the chance, imagine the thought processes going on in his mind every round trying to figure out what Canelo's next move is. This is what exactly what Canelo is talking about, "You will pay... every round, I'll let you stay there in the ring all those rounds and pay each and every round."  And the 11th... is judgement round🙏
Caleb is no slouch probably got the most shots in than any recent fighter against Canelo but Canelo is just different man those who know, know!
And Usman wants to fight him? Canelo would erase him lol
Only his coach can smack him on the head & not die
The Mexican lion, playing with his prey until he decides to eat it for dinner! Caleb is named now "sweet dreams" instead.
This is what shit talkers get👍 KING Canelo 🇲🇽
Canelo has to fight David Benavides now!
Gives me chills when he went up on the ropes mex pride let’s go
Anyone that’s still standing after 11 rounds with Canelo is no slouch, but you gotta do better than just survive to walk away with his belt.
I was hoping Caleb would win, but I had a feeling this was going to happen. Canelo is just amazing, all there is to it lol
Canelo tiene una condición física demasiado buena
Plant stands a little like Mayweather,that's what Mayweather would get if he did a rematch with canelo
Let’s see what the haters have to say now, canelo ran all night after this track and field guy…..   😂😂😂😂
Canelo went after plant when wify says I’m horny come home after the first knock down…#quickfeet 🤣
Pura carnita hasada cual anburgesa h gandules
I'd love to see cocky Mayweather to fight him now, he's come a long ways since he fought Mayweather. Who else wants to see Mayweather get his Ass kicked?
Joke ass jake Paul thinks he has a ghost of a chance against the KING?! JP is the one scared.
Couldn't touch Mayweather tho
premature stoppage.. I think he coulda still went on
The way canelo went from passive mode to active after that KO was scary but cool
All that talking lmao
FUCK Canelo! His last 5 fights he beat all C- white boys! He left 154 and 160 because of the Charlo's and Demetrius Andrade. The media hype is bullshit! He's still no Floyd!
we boxing fans have seen two great Champs lately...fury and canelo...canelo is an active fighter so his fights are fun to watch . floyd was a master technician..Noone put him down so you can't deny his alltime status, but man I love watching canelo work...some guys of the same frame or smaller than an opponent are still able to generate so much power .  his punches do damage.   you can train a lifetime and still not have that type of power..some things are from the man upstairs...congrats to canelo...a true asset to real boxing
Canelos career excelled to another level after losing to Floyd.  That fight gave him the ultimate experience better than any other opponent he's had and damn has he benefited from it!
If canelo chases you , he really trying to hurt you 😳
Esto es normal,cuando.peleas contra puro.petardo, por eso este canelas no pelea con G.G.G
Canelo is a “different animal but the same beast” as Kobe Bryant would say.
The best
He looks way way faster wtf!!!! Canelo and those roids
Now stop ducking the black fighters
No fkn stamina. Bruh!
The 🔑 factor was Canelo’s Stamina , Kudos !!!🌱  Uve Made a New Fan
It’s King Floyd! Get it right!
Andy Ruiz just smiling bottom right at 2:00
Plant s'est planté! (This can't be translated...)
Why does everyone act like this is a surprise? Everyone said the Canelo would win in this exact way. They are going to continously allow him to walk them down, and they just do not have the stamina to beat him. Caleb was a hype job from the beginning, and he was there for a payday plain and simple.
No one can beat a roided up Canelo, back acne doesn't lie...
I bet Canelo can't pass a urinalysis
🤦🏿‍♂️now watch he run run run and not fight Charlo or Andrade
If GGG could not knock Canelo, no way Caleb would. It would be so frustrating knowing you are giving it your all and to Canelo are tabs...only GGG has been able to take them bombs...do we need GGG vs Canelo 3?
man... should have bet on Alvarez. he's a full-on warrior.
Canelo is way too strong and smart 🤓
You could see Mike Tyson with the biggest smile on his face in the background. Incredible moment.
That's one bad ass Irishmen
Honestly would have loved to see prime Canelo fight prime Mayweather
It's pointless when boxer talk all that crap only to get their asses whooped in the end
Congrats Canelo and also plant lost because of being over confident and lack of discipline and Canelo won because of hard work passion and dedication and discipline.
All Hail King Canelo.  You Plant talkers can stop dreaming now.
Mike tyson predicted it..he got fucked up
Let the haters start making up sh#$t. Canelo is the one we were waiting for.
Viva México 🇲🇽!!!!
The best to ever do it for us Mexicans, much respect to Caleb plant, he’s a great fighter but not in the level of canelo
Caleb has such a tragic past....this fight won't set this warrior back.
Этот парень достоин! Поздравлю!
Plant was in good condition Canelo is just a phenomenal beast crown King Canelo
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Only I can knock out Canelo
Canelo is the best....
Feel bad for him. Dude lost a little girl as a dad.... Dont like to see this but he signed the contract...
Left boxing years ago. Come back to see the highlights, and the same shit. Fixed fights all day long. What a shame.
I wanna see Errol Spence fight carnelo.
After the fight Caleb’s hot wife left with King Canelo.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It was never a contest. Canelo has always been the superior fighter.
Sports is a joke
Callando oxicos otra ves la pesasdilla del mundo viva nuestro Mexico 🇲🇽querido hoy y cienpre cabrones 💪🇲🇽💪🤜🤜 a huevo que si canelo
He was good until he got caught. The 2 rounds was terrible. Boxing lol
VIVA LOS LATINOS AQUÍ SIEMPRE APOYÁNDO A CANELO ÁLVAREZ VIVA MÉXICO 💪💪🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👑👑
They ain’t fuckin wit Canelo rn ! 😂
Smoking Joe left hook!
As I said. White boy down and out. It was  a matter of time. Next! UFC, Covington got stopped too.
Caleb didn't use his jab correctly and his right cross wasn't strong
Damn is Canelo still juicing?
🤙🏽
Triology GGG , all these guys are shit.
Thanks canelo 10k win for me brother thanks for putting that food in the table for the family much respect brother
Caleb deserve alot of credit
Best fighters at 160. Charlo Best fighter at 168 . Benavidez Best fighters at 175 . Beterbiev/ bivol. HAS CANELO FOUGHT THEM? Belts mean Jack
Plant really surprised me in how well he did I thought he was going to get stopped sooner honestly so props to both fighters…
The guy everyone knew was going to win won,  boxing is so predictable. I guess congratulations Canelo. I guess.
Not going to lie. Caleb took pretty good shot’s.  But Canelo is just too much.  Arriba Mexico Cabrones!  Arriba Canelo Cabrones!
Canelo ducked charlo and andrade
Now he can fight the 3 fighters he been ducking for years right???! Charlo, David and Boo Boo?????
GGG VS CANELO 3 make it happen
Any fighter who's been caught with Clenbuterol such as Canelo and people in his camp is not a real champion in my eyes. Plant never stood a chance the whole system was rigged against him the whole time.
Check him for clenbuterol in the tainted beef he ate prior to the match.  😂😂😂😂.   GGG is better than Alvarez.
Caleb se miraba que podia seguir despues de la primera caida pero ya no quiso seguir creeyendo que podria ser noqueado de una manera vergonzosa
Caleb I lost my bets on you but you know I don't mind you have such guts and determination!! Seem like the whole building was against you but you stuck to your plan! You have NOTHING TO REGRET!
If Canelo went up against a more aggressive fighter it would have been a more fair fight. They’re pitching people that fight to slow against him. He’s clearly an aggressive fighter with high rush drive and everyone he goes against are all defensive fighters.
CANELO ÁLVAREZ EL VERDADERO KING OF KINGS CAMPEÓN VIVA MÉXICO 💪💪💪👑👑👑🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
12 Tribes are The True Kings on Earth wait till we get back in power real real soon over for you Heathen nations “ Psalm 82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. 7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.” We broke the laws but The Lord is Coming to Restore all things to Israelites very soon gotta love The Bible
All these comments on he didn’t beat mayweather, don’t mean shyt he is still the undisputed champion, canelo bagers mad a Mexican is running shyt!
“Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.” -Thanos
Ok Donte's boxing running your mouth! Bring wards punk ass out he fought when there was no talent in boxing! Bring out the black superman!
Canelo will beat the holy stuff out of canelo
Roids will do that to you!!🤣🤣
he lost to triple g in reality. not to mention testing positive for the steroid Clenbuterol.
Canelo is hands down one of the VERY BEST to ever lace up the gloves 🥊
He is a cheater tho right 😂
The coronation is complete all hail King Canelo Viva Mexico first Undisputed champion
Le sirvió la escuela de Maywheter
Can someone explain to me why the reF started the count at 5 …?? I counted over n over and can’t see how he arrived at 5
@0:19 Mike Tyson is so happy in this moment in the back!! He knows Canelo is out to kill now
That was not a brutal knock out! F'n WADE has his video titled "brutal KO" which it wasn't even a ko it was a tko. Caleb plant actually performed better then I thought but, canelo is the king
Canelo's only loss of his career came at the hands of Floyd Mayweather! No one else!!!
Y’all stupid for thinking Caleb was gonna win
Boy, Canelo was angry. He ran after Plant.
God bless canelo .
Creo q hubieran parado la pelea en la primera caída lo pudo a ver lastimado grave
Always remember an old floyd beat this man easily!
PED canelo
Aint nobody fucking with canelo
Muy contundente el triunfo de canelo
Plant talked a lot of shit and got what he deserved.
2 great warriors congrats Canelo
Another victim to the before and after fighting canelo videos
This fight was the Caleb equivalent of the Canelo vs Mayweather fight. This will bring the best out of Caleb and he will be another fighter like Canelo became. Caleb faced his toughest test to date and he knows now there are MORE levels to this.
NO MORE SHOULDER ROLLS😩😩🤣🤣🤣🤣💩👎🏽🤡 MADE HIM RUN TO THE OTHER CORNER🏃🏃👈🏽 GOODNIGHT ALL MOUTH‼️ CANELO TOLD HIM, U STINKY, U GARBAGE, U FIGHT NOBODY BUT BUMMS, CAB DRIVER👈🏽
I can’t call him no undisputed nah he lost to Floyd badly
That steroid left hand went through Caleb's defense 🤣🤣🤣
Canelo is a beast he was getting out boxed the whole fight then this amazing this just tells me how great Floyd chin is lol
¿Saben cuál fue el problema de Plant? Haberle mentado la madre a Canelo 😌🤷🏻‍♀️ Plant obtuvo lo que buscó 😊 GRANDE Canelo!!! Bien ganado 🙌🏼🥳
Que pelea tan mas falsa parecia un circo
Caleb fought a solid fight! Nothing to hang his head over in losing here. Canelo, plain n simple, is an all time great. A different breed. But much respect to Plant!
Canelo is like Floyd rn everyone paying to see him lost even thou he already lost to Floyd
Caleb got heart tho.. I mean look at Canelo’s face
Canelo is a true Mexican warrior. A true legend. Plant what a performance he did awesome considering everybody was against him. He held his own and he deff earned respect.
Tim Bradly  https://youtu.be/6G83GSFF14w?t=166
Damn y’all show nothing but canelo highlights????
I went to sleep so peacefully knowing I would wake up and see Canelo winning vs plant easy dubz king 👑
Canelo needs to grow 2 more arms for all those straps he has acquired.
🏆🇲🇽🏆
Everyone was hating on plant but I think he’s a warrior for how he stuck to his game plan and fought it out till the end
He fucked white boy up!
Creo que Eddy le Lego mas fuerte a Canelo en la cabeza que lo que pudo pegarle plant en Toda la Pelea ⛏️
1 lucky punch. Caleb was beating his ass.  REMATCH!
Canelo is on steroids..
Like it or not all hail king "Canelo" 🥊🌍🥊🌎🌏
I love both of these fighters but said Caleb better know how to avoid shots and be ready to DIE in that Ring, because Canelo was bringing some real heat!
And Jake Paul thinks he has a chance
And the drug cheat does it again. SOB should have been banned.
I wonder if jake Paul still wants to face Canelo
Bet canelo wont fight BUD crawford csuse he'll get his ass wrecked!!! Absolutely destroyed by bud
you can't have the name sweet hands without landing one single good punch that's it's wack get dude out of the boxing game
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
GREAT JOB CALEB PLANT💯🥊🥊🇺🇲🥊🇺🇲CONGRATS CANELO, AMAZING FINISH.💕
Canelo bought  the  judges mmm you know how mexico works 💸💸💸💸💰💰💰💰 money's  talks that why he won  Plants should be  the winner not him 😡😡😡😡😡
shoulder roll my ass ,
wish we could’ve saw canelo vs floyd 2
Wow Canelo’s great.
we get to witness the legendary canelo!
After Canelo fought Mayweather he became a different beast
Caleb was right he mark his words as a bully and ignorant trying to lie and also copying a bad version of Floyd running around and trying to punch sideways while canelo knew and he knows how to defense from those cheaters on Floyd bit canelo canelo was a boy practically was already I grown up cheater as we know Floyd he get up all month all his fights that were not really good even Medina kick his ass and they didn't accept that Floyd was elusive because the mafia want to keep my him money with him and they thought that they were going to do the same thing with Caleb big mistake canelo is the best like it or not he cake asses so choke it and start learning how to respect a good fighter as canelo Alvarez
It doesn't look like Canelo is still taking peds. Didn't need them for last two opponents. Needed em for GGG though and still needed a BS scorecard. Aside from Canelo never winning a Mayweather round a fake GGG win and a "tainted meat" excuse he's a treat to watch.
Can we now get a Charlo fight?
Cayo otro ablador
That slap to the back of the head of Canelo at 0:39 made me bust out laughing.
I still believe Canelo is not the best Mexican fighter.
Mayweather was right. He said canelo would become the face of boxing. he also said he didn't expect canelo to go to light heavyweight.
Still haven't beat Mayweather lmao..jk..but seriously canelo is the truth at this point..I'm not like those casual to say oh he ain't fight nobody cuz he's not my skin color..truth is the truth hes just from Mexico..
Canelo is the king 👑
Eso Les pasa a Los bocones fanfarrones ke siempre kieren humillarnos . Sabiento ke traemos Buena Escuela de Boxeo  Arriba Mexico 💪💪💪💪💪
VIVA MEXICO PINSHE PLANT ME LA PELA
If you like canelo Run 🏃‍♂️ like this post
Why am I not surprised? I could’ve bet the life of my unborn daughter that Canelo was going to win!
Y does boxing look so rigged now😵
Caleb didn't back down.props..Caneko is just a better overall fighter NOTHING to be ashamed of caleb
No lo ubiera nkeao lo ubiera seguido castigando para que sele quite lo osicon
I respect Caleb
Good ko
Canelo wins the crowd with these types of performance. He is a true champion.
Please stop wasting our time as boxing fans by pitting unworthy fighters against Alvarez. Plant got ABSOLUTELY OUT CLASSED BY CANELO. This wasn’t even an entertaining fight. It was a beat down. Great job, Canelo 🥊💪🏾💪🏾
Plant tough. Canelo a beast just need to fight Charlo or a brother seem like he be ducking the melanin.
Bro I don't even care about Floyd anymore. Yes he's forever goat to a certain respect, but come on. As far as fighters who are actually trying to fight are concerned, Canelo is by far the king. Floyd knew what he was doing fighting Canelo so early.
Prime canelo definitely better than any boxer in history🤯🔥🔥
Whewwww, that Uppercut was Nasty.
He is nice but just shows that Mayweather was on a level of his own
KING CANELO🤴💪🏽
Late stoppage
Benavidez will defeat canelo soon
Still didn't Beat Mayweather.
Damn!! Straight to the action. Great job Showtime.
Viva Mexico Cabrones!!!!
dale dale
The angriest little mexican run ever lol.
El chingon de chingones cáñelo  did what he does best   kick asses
If GGG wasn't such a coward he would of chased Canelo to 168! GGG is literally the toughest fighter Canelo ever faced but GGG simply wont leave 160lbs he literally has over 200 fights at 160lbs smh hes bigger than Canelo dont tell me Canelo can go to 168 but he cant either!
What more can be said about canelo . There may never be another like him .
It's alright Caleb, Canelo lost to Floyd and bounced back to be where he's at now. Go back to the gym bruh and you'll come back even harder. Good shit Canelo gotta give you your props
He didn’t even get hit..
Usman don't want no parts of this man he is a murderer
Absolutely knew it was just a matter of time!!!!
Caleb plant is overrated
You know you mastered your craft when you beat top guys with ease
Plant has a chin for real
Are you not entertained? I need Ward to step up now with all that mouth
Caleb showed skills and heart my respect to him and canelo thats a baaad man! 🇲🇽
Still amazing how Mayweather beat this guy. He's so good. That's what made it even better. Good fight Canelo.
Canelo has a true love for his craft. Plant didn’t have the power to match Canelo’s. Great job to both modern day gladiators
The next heavyweight champion of the world  coming soon
🔥 https://youtu.be/X2xzeZ4RyFg
Caleb to skinny for canelo
I'm confused by the title of the video, it wasn't an uppercut 😂😂
Great fight some people just different  canelo must be hella real
Tim Bradley be spot on with his predictions
Don't We Love STEROIDS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅the NEW NORM😎
At least Caleb Plant didn’t quit like Billy Joe Saunders
Cherry picking king
Floyd still beats him today
Who is these guys he been fighting
Too bad he couldn’t do this to goatweather
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Yall need better actors
THATS A BADASS MAN!!!!!!!!!
This just proves Mayweathers greatness because Carello is a bad man and one of the goats.
!!!DIFFERENT BREED???YOU ARE GODAMNED RIGHT WE ARE MEXICANS HUMBLE GOOD HARTED PEOPLE!!NOT HISPANIC!!NOT LATINOS!!"WE ARE,"MEXICANS"
Ref: you wanna fight? Plant:yea  *Cuts to canelo punching him* Plant:nvm I’m running
Knocked him out with a neck punch loool Mexico #1 muhapukkers !!!
WARNING. This is what happens when you call Canelo a mother-fucker… Great win Canelo … Plant got planted … 🤣🤣🤣
🇲🇽👏❤️como México 🇲🇽 no ay 2 👈🏼
I wonder who is giving all these thumb downs?!?!?! Canelo displayed boxing mastery with this knockout! I think I know "the group" of people who disliked this. SMDH
4 Plant 2 have fought only bssdrvers and machancs, he did helluva job,but Champ Canelo had mercy,cud hav really hurt him.
You could immediately see when Canelo flipped the switch in round 6. Great fight from both fighters, respect to Plant for the valiant effort. Most importantly congrats to Canelo, this was his night!
🌵Ese Es Mi Mexico🍻 Carbones 🇲🇽 🥸Watch how your man Plants Back at the 10th Round, BOTH SIDES🤕 Are ALL Red, Depleted And @ 11th ☠  .. 7 Fucking Belts, & He Dedicated to the LATINOS,🤩 !! RESPECT CARBON 🥂
🔥🇲🇽 "Timing, timing is what I got for fast fighters" - Canelo. No doubt,  Caleb looked greater than what I expected but Canelo's just a different machine! Canelo went to the ropes to face Caleb's power and exchange punches but Caleb seemed he didn't want the smoke 🔥!  The only way for Caleb to win was if Caleb would take a knife in the ring! 🔥🇲🇽
We all new plant was gonna lose , but he did put up a fight
@fury canelo y coming 4 you  :P
I said two weeks ago, Plants undisciplined stance would get him beat and that's what I saw
Excellent stoppage no need to take more punishment.
Awevo
Caleb had all that size but fought like he was the prey.
Mexico dominating boxing ain’t no doubt about it 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
bink bop bink where u going big fella
That clembuterol def changed canelo in second half . Big help . 😎 📠
I swear Tyson, Tank, and Canelo have very similar movement patterns. That crouch, fainting like he’s going to body then goes upstairs man beautiful.
Caleb did his thing but Canelo is just clutch. He has GOAT level Intangibles. This is Brady or Jordan. He just knows how to win.
Jajaja k sigan hablando de un mexicano ahi esta la respuesta
All due respect to Plant. He was just in there with another type of monster.
Dang i feel bad for her daughter🤣He got the knock the fuck out 🤣🤣
Same punch he showed Ryan garcia
A new King is born . Hail to the King !.
teens today would say - Jake Paul would destroy Canelo! LOL
Money mayweather made him a monster with that lose
Still not better than Floyd Mayweather
Does anyone know both songs that came out in the end of the fight??
My opion triple g beat him
No manches pinche putazotes le plantaron a Plant. No way man what badass punches got landed on plant.  Bet he retires.
Fake fight fake fighters fake win 🥇 fake king 👑
Dont call him a motherfucker
🤣 🤣  Caleb Plant Made Sure He Got Up Fast. 🤣 He Wasn't Tryna Be A Meme.
Canelo is a great fighter but there will always be the p.e.d discussion. Sorry canelo fans, its there and will always be there. When your in any sport but especially a combat sport, once you pop hot then you are suspect no matter what, but he is making killer money so good for him
Canelo is amazing but it’s puts Floyds greatness into context, he made this great fighter look basic
And its all because of Mayweather
Now here come all the drug cheat accusations🙄👑
His better fight charlo
Now all he has to do is beat one elite black fighter
Mejor que pelea con charlo
Does plant get some credit for that second knockdown? , homie hit himself on that
He's no King.. you still walking in Floyd's shadow ..
Canelo made sure HE HIT CALEB IN HIS MOUTH for running it all month. Canello was hitting him like...This-is-for-running- that-mouth...Bam,bop,bap...Knock out!
Nothing less than I expected.  But good job by Plant for surviving so long.
Viva Mexico pinche cabrones
You wanna fight ? . Ya
Best in the 🌎
Damn, Canelo knocked him so silly he thought he was running track, take your mark,, set, bang....
All the people that where rooting for plant a few days ago , just deleted their comments today😂😂😂
Congrats to both fighters...🏆👊
That uppercut sent his ass tho
Pound for pound!! 💪💪
The first body punch in the first round is what scared plant. He showed heart.
Y does everybody 4get that Canelo got beat up by Mayweather
I can’t imagine the power of those punches
Plant tried to fight Floyd's fight.
I knew Canelo was gon' win.... honestly I think he's the second best ever next to Floyd....Smh....that damn Mayweather was just simply unbeatable!!!
El boxeo es todo un show es bueno en canelo pero ojalá peliara con el que le toque no con el  que El Escoja eso es lo malo pero así el boxeo
I'm Mexican and I do not believe Canelo is clean at all.... something seems seriously fishy.😒
All these wins will be dull, TRIPPLE GGG in their previous bouts were close enough to question Canelo victories. Canelo refuses to fight TRIPPLE GGG
Larga vida al Rey Canelo 🥊🇲🇽👑
los unicos que apoyan a canelo son los no sabo kids los mexicanos de adeveras sabemos y conocimos lo ke fue buen box esto de este wey es pura basura 🗑 sigan inflando a boxeadores mediocres.. aver si entienden lo hubiera escrito en ingles pa ke entendieran  pero NO SABO
It kinda went the way most experts thought. That Caleb would have success early in the fight & then later Canelo would shut him down. I am impressed with Caleb's performance. He did better than most people thought he would. Lasted until round 11. Caleb can still improve. Caleb can still be a major factor in that weight class.
Yup Canelo shut up the big mouth
Sol, wouldn't be shit without the peds.
Floyd owns Canelo. Plant not nobody lol. Get real. Shalawam!
THIS SO-CALLED WHITE DUDE CAME OUT WITH A BLACK RRAPPER, TRYING TO TAKE THE CULTURE OF THE BLACKS AND MEXICANS, TO TAKE OVER,... BUT GOT BEAT BY A REAL ONE WHO ACTUALLY CAN DO THIS SPORT.... THE SO-CALLED WHITE PEOPLE ALWAYS TRY TO TAKE THE CULTURE BECAUSE THEY AIN'T GOT NO CULTURE..... AND THEY GET BEAT JUST LIKE THIS.
TRIPPLE GGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He was so dizzy he went to his corner.
Orapinches Malin.chistas Canelo horgullo Mexicano
Your right he throws power bombs shots canelo is just a BEAST
Plant did a gallop runaway from canelo 😂
man i believed this plant dude, hes gotta feel like a dumb ass, this canelo cat winning all this fights. but lost to floyd boxing dont make no scence. and canelo would get beat quick in mma, before all u dorks keep hailing this so called king.....
Back to the medieval times...🙄... that's 🗣️ KING CANELO...!!!💪
Good fight 💯👏👏👏👏
Plant the tombstone RIP
Buen trabajo CANELO!!
KING
That place must have felt so amazing. The crowd is electric, just incredible
Дыщулкл Now all is left is Gervonta Tank vs Canelo thanks
Plant copied Mayweather with his shoulder roll and was very effective, defensively. However, Caleb's punches was a mile too short and only used the jabs in early rounds. Canelo was punching plant with the same routine every round but plant didn't capitalize by counter punching. There was alot of chances which Plant could have took advantage but he was too passive and his punches was just too short. It looks to me that Plant got worn out and tired at the late rounds in which Canelo got him at the 11th round.
Wheres the cheating at?? Didnt Plant claim Canelo cheats?????
I had to lay 100 to 40 to make money canelo figth a real fighter fight Spencer or  Charlotte  ggg you c Jerry picker
Ok now let's check and drop the Vada test for us fool .
Man Canelo was far too superior to Plant to begin with. I'm surprised it went 11 rounds I predicted 7
Were all my blacks at? Lol 😂 😂😂🤣no were
Lo iso que se tragara las mentadas que le dio jajajajjajaja bien hecho Canelo aver cuánto le dura la trompa hinchada jajajaja
Never any doubt
Canelo will not fight anyone that MIGHT whip him  Canelo is crap nothing but
The way Canelo swims in the pocket stutter stepping on the inside is second to none. Never seen anything like it.
Arrieros somos. 😎
That's why his pound 4 pound .. Plant not good enough kid what did u expect ..
Love the heart by Plant tho.
Canelo warned him there was levels to this shit!!!
Puro pollo agarra el canelo hasta ahorita no me convenze le falta para sea un chavez un marquez, un terrible Morales, puro teatro
It’s levels to this. Plant was exhausted by this round and canelo could have went 20 rounds if he had too
Jake Paul  been quiet after this fight.😜
Caleb was gassed it was bound to happen
Never Never .....plant ☘️ it's just a plant he's just a talker Mexican Power 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 there's level's easy 💰💰💰💰
Canelo should have played with him till the last round just to expose Caleb's big mouth.
Booooo
If canelo fought bivol at 175 canelo would be the one on the ground.. but we know that fight won't happen
Current canelo would decimate prime mayweather, simple.
Viva Mexico viva el Canelo
Canelo kicked his f_cken a$$
Paque Respete a la madre de uno🤡
Te lo advertimos caleb te enfrentastes a un grande canelo Alvares es un campeón lo que se propone en el rin lo logra el mejor boxeador de mi época vamos canelo adelante
Look at all the cry baby haters lol
Plant still would have lost ,because the score cards had Canelo winning rounds he was losing in the beginning. Then plant just stop fighting in the later rounds.Tuck to get buck.
Plant got rooted out.
Even though some think that Canelo punches are non effective his opponents think otherwise……respect to Plant, Viva Mexico!!
Canelo is nothing but raw power and strength. There are better boxers than him, but he’s just too strong, his skills and his overwhelming pressure, you can’t stop him. Floyd did it at the right time. I see that plant tried to mimic that blue print but didn’t have the confidence to throw those punches when it was time to throw them. The shoulder roll did well but, his offence just couldn’t stop or stifle Canelo. Canelo wasn’t bothered at anytime or anyway in the fight. He’s the best! And I hate saying that. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Tyson Fury vs Canelo Alvarez   Lets do it
I told people if you ain’t got the power to keep Canelo off of you it’s over !! That’s why Benevidez is the only guy and he can’t box like everyone else!!
Otro hocicon que cae ante un guerrero Azteca nunca le mientes la madre aun mexicano por que es lo mas sagrado que tenemos Viva Mexico
I knew he was gonna get his ass wooped!
4 belts? 1 year.viva mexico.
I called it from the beginning plant had zero chance all hail King canelo plant falls back you may go home and cry in your wife's lap
What a class act. ¡VIVA MÉXICO!
If Canelo did not knockout this Plant dude the fuck out the fucking Cabrons would of robbed Canelo. Canelo used the left hook to set up the right uppercut. The pressure and the power made the difference in the later rounds. Plant dude could not sustain  the same energy Plant had in the earlier rounds. Canelo had thrown way more body shots. I believe Canelo body shots and  pressure wore Plant down brick by brick. Canelo eventually pull out the lawnmowers to finish Plant off and it was not a happy ending for Mr. Plant Dude.
At this point he only needs to fight Charlo. He'll beat Charlo too but that's really the only way to clean sweep the division.
The perfect mix of a technical boxer with just the right amount of power. Congrats
Canelo showing and proving like tank and all these great fighters
Looks like plant took a dive...
Caleb plant got planted. To see how great of a boxer Canelo is now is amazing. Also I have even more respect for Mayweather because he made Canelo look less than average.
The judges already had the robbery lined up regardless of the KO
Payday
🥩🥩🥩🥩 for each belt
It did tske balls him getting up like that
I think they should create like 12 more belts though
Eubank jr is the king of the division
Beast
mexico 🇲🇽
He is becoming a GOAT🐐right in front of our eyes🇲🇽🇲🇽
Time for Ward to come out of retirement.
Caleb plant made many new fans tonight he held his own , fast jabs and great footwork  , hats off to him !
This Irish boxer is pretty good.  Oh wait, he's Mexican? No mames guey!
Viva Mexico cabrones!
I want Mayweather's comeback.  Against this Canelo.
I can’t believe y’all cheering for this shit
411 H8ERS SALTY ASF 😭
Otro con una gran boca que fue aplastado,,,,,
Canelo needed the knockout. He was getting out boxed. Please Canelo fans admit it.
Some how I knew canelo would win
He did it the lame way. Bum
U all are lame. He beat up Caleb Plant. A guy that we didn't really know how good he was. Bum l. Got beat up Charlo. Hahahaha
Tim Bradley said what would happen to plant if he did that leaning move
King clinbueterol lol
Plant stay y ass  down quit talking all that talk
Great effort by plant.  Canelo is too strong and ferocious.
Shows how great Floyd really is
U beat calab Plant tho. It's not charlo. U beat my guy but u didn't beat one of the best. Caleb was still proving himself
Puro rival que  no tiene boxeo rivales flojos con el viejito del triple G no le topaste así 🤷🏿‍♂️ pero en fin puro negocio el boxeo jamás serás como Julio César Chávez 🥊
Told yall. Plant knew deep down that Canelo was gonna dog him
Jake Paul you have no chance.
There’s always a first time for everything Like him fallen down 💪🇲🇽🇲🇽
canelo is forever a cheat we just dont know how or what he is on right in this fight.
Simply the Best. All belts coming home.
Dude curled up like a loser. Yall tripping canelo is trash 🗑
CAN E LO! Plant got the ass kicking he asked for.
Hail the King
That Whole camp!! Is Juicing!!! 💉👎🏿
He beat some fear in him
Viva Mexico canelo #1
Es fácil hablar verdad caleb?
Hand selected opponents!
Runelo is still a steroid cheat and a paper champ. Until he actually beats triple G he is a joke.
That should shut Caleb's mouth 🤣
He still ducking rocky Balboa
How next the charlos,
What would happen to Mayweather had they fought prime for prime
Esta bueno el circo. Payasos principales , Rodolfo Vargas y Jc Chavez
Let go baby 🇲🇽 🇲🇽 🇲🇽
I feel like canelo was forced to let this fight go for as long as it did. Seeing how they were far ahead of schedule. A quick knock out would pissed off a lot of fans. Canelo could have destroyed caleb way earlier with body shots alone.
Idgaf caleb plant a beast and put up a damn good fight made canelo work for it for sure
Now that Canelo is in his prime, unlike he was when he was 23, we want to see Camelo Floyd rematch.
CANELO NUMBER  ONE.
Weak ass punches. The whole fight were weak ass punches. You people are gullible AF. Vegas won this fight once again.
Canelo  number  .
No one is gonna beat canelo he’s such a beast great boxer great defense great chin power he has it all
That power is not normal... If yall kno what I mean👀💉
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES 💚🤍❤️ Don’t ever talk about a mans mother
Saul salute
Canelo kicked his Royal A..... What a finish
0:23 the light on mike Tyson😂
O wou  I didn’t expected what a surprise canelo win ,,, 🎉🎉🎉
Wise words for those who face Canelo: make your words soft and sweet you never know which one you have to eat.
Caleb did alot better than i expected.    He def deserves respect!
Ref was like you sure you wanna fight 😄🤣😂
What the haters have to say ..Hello Any canelo hater 🇲🇽💯🔥
VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽 🤴
🤣🤣
And then there's people like Jake Paul trying to fight canelo smh
All that conference  all that slick talk.   For what 🪴 got cooked
Be the way! CANELO Predicted hes was gona win the Fight! So he did 💪🏽👊🏽👊🏽
I was surprised by plant performance pretty good i expected far less, got my respect, but canelo reign supreme, bye the end of his career he will be at 90 fights and undisputed at 168, 175, 185 lbs
Que les quede claro nunca se meten con un mexicano y mucho menos hablar mucho antes de pelear
Great job team Alvaroids!
Dive boxing is such a dirty business
Pound for pound the best in boxing. Congratulations.
Haven’t seen Canelos face that fucked up before!  Damn!
Plant gave it all he had left it all in the ring and wasn't afraid to lose his 0 he gained a fan tonight and I called it 11th round
Why people are excited about canelo knocking  a bum lol.....you act like he beat Tyson or something lo
11 rounds damn, Plant lasted a hell of a lot longer than I expected. My fight analysis had him TKO by 8 with an uppercut. He lasted 3 rounds long than expected by me.
Now I’m 100% sure benevidez will whoop canelo
Good night mtf never talk trash a mexican bay bay
I knew Plant was out of his league
There's a lot of bigoted comments in here about race shaming. Mexico has a lot of proud people and unfortunately everyone, it's their time in the ring. From the great white hopes to the great Muhammad Ali.  Mexico fell short, so support and celebrate their time in ring.
Hmm, Canelo "PLANTED" his ass to the mat
Viva Cinnamon! Caleb got "planted"
Did anyone see how he runs up on plant when bell rang and after plant got up😂 plant balled up he knew at that time in that round he f up🤦‍♂️🍾🥂 to both boxers to canelo keep making history and shut down the haters and ko them!
To the next fighter that wants to face Canelo, here is a tip: DON'T PISS HIM OFF, unless you want to get destroy then run your mouth like plant 🤣🤣
Canelo vs Mayweather 2022
Canelo never gets tired, very good endurance..
Otro costal le pusuieron y la gente se lo Cree a si es con Mayweather no pudo a golovkin ni le quiso dar la revancha si estuviera pacquiao en su momento le pone su madrina  100 seguro
I mean this wasn’t a surprise was it?
Plant said I wanted to keep fighting 😂 😵‍💫 guy has heart what I dislike is his shit talking if wasn’t for that everyone in that crowd would of have him his props along with canelo if he was a gentleman to sport of boxing as he preached if! 🤦‍♂️👊🏼
Canelo is truly an all time great.
He told him is another level
I told you! Beat the body and the head will follow.  Canelo brought his hands and head down by body shots.  When that happened, Canelo caught him with that nasty upper cut. If you notice in his training, Canelo worked on that heavy black ball bag strengthening his upper cut. 🥊
"And the NEW,,,DEFEATED"!
50-0
Caleb (The wanna be Mayweather) Plant got knocked out! I'm so glad. Always copying the shoulder roll.
IF YOU PAY REAL ATTENTION TO THING'S EVERY PERSON WHO IS OR WAS A HALL OF FAME THE O.G FIGHTERS ALL SAID CANELO IS GOING TO WIN, EXAMPLE MIKE TYSON, ERIC MORALES, MARQUEZ, O.G TRAINERS ALSO SAID CANELO FREDDY ROACH, ETC..... ONLY GUY'S WHO THINK THEY ARE BAD ASS BOXERS BUT AIN'T SAID CALEB, SEE THE DIFFERENCE HOW REAL CHAMPIONS CHECKING THESE GUY'S OUT THEY ALL NEW KIND OF WHO WOULD WIN.
Canelo vs Spence next
Respect to Caleb for making it to 11th and for for trying to take Canelo’s hits... canelo is just a monster with the power he puts in his punch 🥊
Felicidades.
Benavidez
Funny how everybody has no choice but to show plant some respect now because of his driving tenacity and how tough he proved to be, but before it was all this talk about how he wouldn't last 3 rounds with Canelo
Thanos just got the last infinity stone
The best part was when canelo won so they played Puerto Rican music
Canelo need to stop ducking Black Fighters! Y’all on his 🥜 sack! He will lose! He collected all those belts for someone else😂🤣😂🤣
I FELT BAD FOR PLANT TO KEEP IT REAL. I WENT FOR CANELO THINKING MAYBE CALEB JUST MIGHT WIN. THE SECOND TIME PLANT DROPPED HE WAS DONE BUT PLANT ALSO WON TONIGHT, PLANT LOST THE FIGHT LIKE A CHAMPION ONCE YOU CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE YOU JUST CANNOT CONTINUE, YOUR MIND WANTS TO BUT YOUR BODY CAN'T,
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Nelos a MONSTER tho they sleep on him cause of the floyd fight but outside of floyd he's untouchable
Will never respect a fighter with a history of using steroids
That’s what plant gets for talking about canelo’s mother 😂
Caleb tried running away when he knew KO was coming 😂
Canelo wins but that kid fought his heart out
Plant didn't just talk. He stepped up but damn Canelo was not willing to lose tonight. Great fight💪
Tell him to fight Demetrius Andrade now!
“We’ll see motherfucker”
Where's TEAM CANELO? We got the best Plant, and Canelo took care business. If Plant looked like trash everyone would of said Canelo is cherry-picking, it was CHAMPION VS CHAMPION And now with all 4 Super Middleweight World titles Canelo is CHAMPION OF CHAMPIONS, haters and hate, but if UR with a PPV fee you paid to see Plant get laid TF-OUT😁🤗
That should happen to every white guy who talks like hes black.  Put 'em in the ring with Canelo.  I knew from the press conference Canelo was gonna f this guy up.........AND HE DID
Canelo wants no part of fighting a brother.. after Mayweather left his face bruised red. .lol
I see a rematch coming fight number 2
And that strong tree was chopped down.
Canelo has reached master level, there is nobody in or around his weight class that even competes with him at this point in time. He's taken Boxing to a higher level! If it wasn't for Canelo, Fury, and Wilder Boxing would be in a rough spot, we owe these men a lot of gratitude!
There is rumor that Canelo will not fight Latinos…not because he is scared..,only  that he feels that he does not want to impede their progression with a resounding loss against him-he prefers to dominate all out of USA to control all belts in zmexico
Plant did very well, jabbing, moving, but didn't have enough to hurt Canelo so it was a matter of time once he tired
Es bueno canelo pero realmente estos son boxeadores blancos muy blandos
honestly, plant could give any other fighters not named canelo..trouble..he did the best he could and he is tougher than expected
Caleb looked like he was headed to the liquor 🥃 store.
Insert Mayweather lol
Canelo 60 fights behind him, plant 21. Pple really giving canelo big props like he beat mayweather
Lol he has to settle for these 2nd rate fighters but could not put down Mayweather and wears a crown
PED'S
He still a loser againt Mayweather lol
Cameltoe lost to floyd. Great fighter but not even in the top ten when u say best ever thats just stupidity.
Only person that could ever beat C.A is prime Mayweather just because of his defense and counter punching that's why Floyd took him before his prime and C.A picked up Mayweather's defense and he's got way more power then Floyd...C.A might be the 🐐
Plant never planted a punch
His fight with ggg was harder than this one
I knew canelo will win this fight, but I gotta give it to plant for hanging in there and giving his all. He did not make it easy at all for canelo but great win for canelo! 🇲🇽👊🏽
Wow I’m so surprised 😐🤣
Congratulations canelo you beat every white boy in boxing🤷🏿‍♂️😂
Canelo don't taka about my mom again!!
Too bad Canelo has a history that includes a banned substance test failure. A lot of people think “once a cheat, always a cheat”, and he will never shake that reputation.
Leave Saul alone!
EPICNESS
Y que son esos ribales que le echan a canelo ,ho El Los escoje son echos de carton,ayebado una Carrera falsa
Canelo is a good fighter but not great....He hasn't fought enough world champions through out his career, NOT HATING BUT HES OLD MEDIA HYPE AND PED USER  ........Salute to canelo for the win thou, strong finish
Canelo should have never fought Floyd. His career probably would be even better outcome than what it is now! Now he’s just another guy that lost to Floyd.
I think this canelo would kill floyd Mayweather
Plant is a G tho good shit. VIVA LA  RAZA
Canelo is on so many steroids its hard for a clean fighter to beat him. He has juice throughout the entire fight
..BEST FIGHT ..THIS YEAR ..
White boy killaaaaaaa!!!...wanna see him fight blacks or Mexicans now
Night night Caleb 💯🤣💀
I will be truly impressed if Canelo beats Charlo Andrade and benevidez !!!!!!!
Ref almost got sent to Valhalla with Canelo's missed left hook on the second knockdown lol, Plant earned my respect for withstanding that body punishment for 11 rounds, all hail King Canelo
Laced him up good
That’s tko y everyone say ko ? lol props Canelo tho
Canelo haters be like … “GGG”  and the best one “ Floyd Mayweather “  there’s no one that can beat canelo right now !!! Period!!!  Get over it “ it’s my night “
King 🤴 canelo
That’s was so much talk to go down like that
Canelo next fight should be charlo or benavidez ? & I think it should be both against canelo in a handicap match 😎 9 rounds later benavidez & charlo gased out 😅 of energy
Canelo has officially earned the right to fight Jake Paul.
Canelo is always a move ahead than most of his opponents.
Caleb really didn't want to fight because he wasn't throwing hard punches like Canelo. Caleb was just jabbing and that's not going to cut it with Canelo. Like Mike Tyson said " Everyone has a plan until they get hit".
King Canelo the GOAT 👑🐐👑🐐👑🐐👑🐐
That Mexican blood runs hot!! In Mexico, Canelo's PPV's are broadcasted for FREE (Azteca TV) and he carries the love and pride of the Mexican people with him everywhere he goes. He is the definition of ambitious. An organic rags to riches story for sure. It was an honorable fight, but even though Plant came from  humble beginnings, he just does not have the love of a nation like Canelo does to push him to be a goat.
If you not Floyd you don’t need to be doing that Philly she’ll people need to understand that nelo offensive master with crazy timing can walk you clean down you have to be master boxers with great IQ including skills to even get close to beating him I don’t see not fighter beating him now
Eso es todo campeon
Shout out King Canelo!! 🇲🇽 Plant fought great! Good shit Champ!
Canelo is a beast!!!
Viva 🇲🇽 awevo......canelos runing after plant looked funny lol
Canelo is great fighter
Ok......NEXT????
Witnessed Greatness
No surprise here.....the only way someone beat Canelo is if they weigh 30 lbs more and are quick....otherwise, FORGET ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.........also, the Ref should have STOPPED the fight after the first knockdown....the Plant dude was CLEARLY out of it at that point....no need to let Canelo knock more sense into him....although, it was amusing giving the amount of disrespect Plant gave Canelo....although, you could I suppose believe it was fight hype, but there are times when its more than just hype....I think this was one of those times....oh well....NEXT????
Tried to run for his life didnt work good shit canelo
Lo quiero ver conmungia y se le acaba la trallectori da
Canelo is a monster he has gotten better over the years
Esto significa trabajar duro....y no andar vendiendo historias detu vida.......los mexicanos tenemos miles pero a base de trabajo y ezfuerzo estan los resultados celo
At leadt he lasted 11 rounds.
He needs to retire as the great for sure
It is just a circus, money maker business, just went as planned as they wanted to become more millionaries.
Canelo > Floyd
There's levels to this...
Did anyone really see this going any other way
otro fraude más yo no la vi pero puras mamadas el canelo no sirve para nada
Canelo still has these guys to fight before being undisputed legendary boxing champ: Rocky Balboa, Captain Falcon, Balrog, One Punch Man, Kenshiro, Drederick Tatum, Hitmonchan, Jax, and Little Mac.
Al tal plant le plantaron unos buenos trancazos.,eres mi ídolo canelo,,que barbaro.te felicito.,fuck Mayweather.!!!
Drug cheat
After watching this, caleb would eat charlo. Great fight! Congratz for canelo
What punches to the ear, Plant is lucky to be alive
Well deserved mi Canelo de Oro!
fight was great!!!
Canelo still a juice head
Can’t wait for Tank Davis in December
There was no 3 knockdown rules He tried to get up Compare this to fury fight
I knew it was over when he kept on trying to mimick Floyd shoulder roll Lmao gtfoh
ShowTime why wasn’t there any Mexican music between rounds. Disappointed me as a Mexican-American watching the fight live
The fact that the commenters remained quiet after the 1st knockdown to the 2nd knockdown just shows they're aware they're witnessing history...they're in awe.  😯😮😲
Let's see Floyd fuck with him now in his.prime
Too bad Carl Froch is retired. Would’ve enjoyed seeing Canelo fight a prime Froch.
Canelo is the best... Only boxer to  EXPOSE and defeat him is Money Mayweather.....
Watch people still say canelo never fought others in their prime 😂
Bad title! Poster thinks a lefthook is an uppercut! The Roy Jones leaping lefthook did the damage .  The 2 uppercuts was just followup.
Jake Paul destroys canelo first round KO
Plankton never wins at the end
Long live to the king! Canelo rules! Mexico's supremacy! Thanks for this fight my fellow Mexican!
ALL HAIL KING THANELOS!!!!!!! LONG LIVE THE KING!!!! PERFECTLY BALANCED AS ALL THE THINGS SHOULD BE 😎😭
Plant got what he deserved after disrespecting canelos mom
How many fights did Caleb Plant have 21 or 22 ? So what was so special about him ?
Just like at the press conference.. Plant ducks down to his right after getting hit. And the same uppercut slap that sent Plant shades flying, was the same uppercut punch that KO’d Plant
respect to plant , expected canelo to finish him in the earlier round but shows plant has skills was also in good condition, who would ya like to see canelo fight next ?
Sorry son yu had to fight my boy
👍👍
Otro costal más que le ponen a canelo
Canelo Needs More belts! Where does he get more?
Eddy and Canelo together simply the best ! Respect to plant going longer then expected.
Ever since mayweather whooped canelo he vowed to take performance enhancing drugs and to never lose again
Canelo's toughest moment tonight was figuring out how to hold all his belts.
Ouch!  I figured that CONAN was prime to be DESTROYED. Not! Sweet Hands may just move up to LH. Hats off to both of these Super Stars! 👍👋🎯🇺🇸😷💉🎯💉🎯💉👋👍🥊🥊
Vamos Canelo!!!! To all the idiots who picked plant!
Viva mexico cabrones 🇲🇽🥊🥇
Canelo p4p1 and the first 168 undisputed champion kingnelo p4p1
Viva Mexico 🔥🇲🇽
Impressive redhead
Look wtf you did Canelo
Mexican Power!!!!!
They always try to shoulder roll and use mayweathers ganeplan 😂 they always forget the part where mayweather made canelo miss
Canelo moved like Tyson
Payday 😁😁😁
That's Right ▶️
Canelo, the best.
🥱 Still won’t face either Charlo
Steroids 🧃🥤 💉
Msg to Caleb: There are Levels to this...
🇲🇽
Hopefully plant bounces back from this loss just like Canelo bounced back from the Mayweather loss.
Man I wish Floyd faced this version of Canelo would’ve been different story 💯
Another bag of onions to the list!!!😵😵😵😵🍻🍻🍻🍻🌮 🌮
Canelo is the God of boxing these days there isn't a boxer alive that can beat him.  Undisputed Unified Super-Middleweight CHAMPION.
Boxing is still so lame. Hasn’t been the same since the 90s what are those giant ass jumbo gloves lol glad I tuned into a real fight the better ppv in ufc 268 🔥
NEGOCIO ES NEGOCIO cuando tienen la oportunidad de elegir sus costales 🤷🏻‍♂️
PLANT GOT PLANTED
We all knew canelo was gone send caleb to the planets, but after watching this DAVID BENAVIDEZ presents a very uncomfortable fight for canelo. 10 times more powerful and  quicker than plant. And he's active. F charlo, f Andrade, its the only fight i want to see.
The moment is now canelo on top 1991 legend it is his time baby canelo team
Has anyone else noticed how much more liked and a global star canelo has become since he left goldenboy.. he should have left long ago Coker delahoya was just wasting his time. That’s why he’s constantly taking shots at Oscar since leaving
What DG stands for ?
The ref asked plant. Do you want to fight. Yeah.  Plant didn’t. The ref should heave asked. Do you want to get knocked out?
I noticed 6 round and up, Canelo started to pick up the pressure
Great fight! Props to both for doing their best. As mexican I was going for Canelo but I also didnt want to see Plant get Ko'd. That being said Plant is a true warrior.
Ruiz in the crowd analyzing the fight
All I know is Floyd is 50-0 and he is from the land💯 🇺🇸 Put them in Front him he beat them even Canelo and floyd was 36 da older fighter 💯I believe Terence Crawford stop him at 150 152 🤭🤫act like u aint catch dat
Canelo keep picking up the easy ones.
What if this was all fake lol like wwe haha 😂
Congrats but he was no match for you bro lol I’d rather see jake Paul tbh
I already knew plant was going to loose…he’s fighting one of the best Mexican boxers after all. Respect to each fighter.   I had a feeling Canelo way going to find a was pass plants jab.
the ped  king wins again
How many times have we all heard " he's been knocked down for the first time of his career" in a canelo fight?
Canelo was -1000. He was heavy favorite to win. To win by KO was still around -185. This wasn't that shocking guys.
SHOUT OUT TO CANELO AND MY LATINO PEOPLE...LATINO PEOPLE STAND UP.
A lesson in the serving of humble pie😎 Truly epic fight!!! Viva Mexico👏👏👏 Love seeing Hispanics dominating the ring.  We have just witnessed history being made. Respect to both warriors!!!
This is WHAT " PED  DRUGS " CAN DO for YOU
Canelo es Un Fraude!!!
Caleb is lucky the ref stopped the fight. Otherwise permanent KO.
He’s a great fighter but let’s not ever forget how Floyd made this guy look.  I’ve never seen Canelo look so frustrated or out of his league.  He can enjoy his reign now.
Canelo has surpassed mayweather
Canelo cut the ring off so freaking good. Plant put up his best fight but damn, it shows how good canelo is. The man’s a beast.
Who is plant again 🤔. I been watching boxing almost all my life and never heard of plant
Brutal knock out canelo gave plant. The only person who can beat canelo is andre ward.
He hung in there. Needed to fight the perfect fight for 12 rounds. Was stagnant after round 4 and ran into trouble against the ropes which is never a good idea against Canelo. He can hold his head up high boy got skill, learn from the loss, and ascend into that next level. Canelo did it after mayweather, hoping this young man does the same
ANOTHER CAHUACHI MODERN "CANELO" NEED MAYWEATHER AGAIN !🤦
🤣😂
That is a lunging left hook.
Felicitaciones canelo Álvarez campeón,me alegro mucho que hayas noqueado a la verdad ni me importa mencionar el nombre de ese bocon.
I’m waiting for all the Benavides fanboys to say ANYTHING about Caleb.. plant stops Benavides period
Respect for plant. Fought a good match. The better male one.
History was made this night canelo did it and I give props to Caleb as well he did his best put in some good work almost lasting the 12 rounds great fight 👏 👍 👌
Lamoooo Charlo sisters were hoping and selling their souls to Lucifer so they could later make a move on plant and not have to face canelo 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 ffffffff u African Americans
Canelo"s next opponent: a single mom that just got off a double shift and came home and saw the trash hadn't been taken out.
And this is why we need to give great fighters there flowers especially Floyd money Mayweather with no losses even against canelo Alvarez.
Dana White-“Usman doesn’t want to fight Canelo”🤣🤣🤣🤣 n
Who told plant this was a good idea? Canelo is on god mode .
I got family from Tennessee thru my wife but they know not to talk to me in any kinda of way like caleb talked bout us ajhhahahhaha 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Los 2 Boxeadores son Basura, Que porqueria... Un nadie contra Un nadie, 👎🏽
This guy makes the judges waste their night out. He makes the scorecards and discussions of scorecards quite useless. A great champion.
Don't talk about his mom bro
The whole time seemed like Caleeb was paid not to throw any punches, I don"t buy it.
Viva el rey de los costales👏👏👏
Andre ward rn 🤐
Give the Showtime videos about Canelo and Plant and you gain even more respect for both fighters. Plant fighting for something more than just belts and money, and Canelo looking to make history. Plant gave his all, he didn’t duck the top dog and went down trying his best. And congrats to Canelo Alvarez for becoming the first undisputed Mexican champion even with there being numerous great champions coming out of Mexico. Mexican fighters are a different breed who deserve absolute respect.
We knew this was going to happen Caleb tried an went further then I was like thought he still lost
Ref: Do you want to fight? Plant: I am not Groot Canelo: I'm about to plant you on the floor.
Canelo is now the best pound for pound, I literally can say he's the best in his division. And the only one defeat from Mayweather  Canelo is the greatest in this current modern-day generation in the middleweight. Not this in the zone boxing youtube shit. Disgrace to boxing.
Now the can call I’m p4p #1 but let’s see what Crawford do
Well DAMN plant got put in the DIRT 😂😂😂👀
It was a great performance. Respect.
To all those haters “on Mexicans “ suck it we’re here to stay 😂 keep on hating
Caleb is still real nice .. respect to him!!!
Canelo definitely at the top to stay now. He cleaned out the European division and like fighters. He definitely the man..I wonder what's next..I think The Soviets got a couple of stars over there..😏
Shout out to canelo and i am happy for his success. He receives so much support
Plant got up. fucken ay many would have stayed down. I no his chin is pointing up.
That's Right Haters! Not To day. Or better yet Ever. Viva Mexico Cabrones💪🏽😎
He getting that crazy sloppy tonight 🤪
Where’s punk ass charlo
Honor a quien honor merece bien calla bocas hecho en México para el mundo saludos canelo DESDE CORONA QUEENS NY.🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👍
Now watch all thr lies and excuses not to fight Charlo and Benivedez from Alverez fan girls. We know hes afraid of Andrade, no need to mention him.
I work there I seen all of these commentators kissing Each others
A este guey ya solo le ponen vatos pues para que gane dinero solamente 🤣
Time for ward
Canelo the living legend
P.E.D.S
He on something
Paid fight Crawford would destroy him lol
Feel like plant didn’t fight his fight ! Never seemed comfortable in there
Still ain't saying canelo the best people can say I'm hatin all they want he not the best mexican I ever seen and ya Im black saying this if it julio chavez I don't wanna fuckin hear it fight charlos or boo boo andrade then we can talk!!
Domination is complete!!!!!!!!
Guess its time to go up or down in weight and take more titles or beat down anyone left in the 164 division
This just shows how good Mayweather and GGG are. GGG won one of their two fights, and arguably both fights
MAYWEATHER hating right now ..MAYWEATHER didn't leave a mark like canelo just did today..MAYWEATHER was good but never left a impact like canelo
I don't see anyone beating Canelo right now, great knockout, but I had plant winning, I feel everybody, including the commentary for the fight was extremely bias, plant made Canelo miss so many shots and blocked many as well, I don't get how so many people had Canelo winning prior to the ko. Plant was doing his thing, and Canelo ended catching him like I thought he would late and win, but c'mon people, plant did amazing prior to that, let's be real
Plant earned the right to keep fighting they should not have stopped that they should have let the man get back up to see cuz he was trying they did not even count him out
The ref should let him got up like he did fury but people don't see cheating in boxing
Kiero berlo com benavides  venavide el lareplica de gggg  aversi es cierto
VIVA MÉXICO CABRONES!!!!!!!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I seen the brown spot on the shorts right on the backside
Mayweather better
What's up with these dudes storming out of the ring lately after a loss.. no interview, post fight, I'll be back, going back to the drawing board, NOTHING! You big mouth like a man, you get your face smashed in like a man..js
You know he clinch those cheeks
BORING FIGHT!!! We all knew canelo would win easy, by KO, A REAL fight is Wilder v Fury, Not some Clown GOING to A DIVISION WHERE HE KNEW HE COULD BE UNDISPUTED, he should have stayed at 175 and go undisputed there, but we all know he will always duck TOP FIGHTERS!
Caida de autuacion calep el primer caida nile pego ila segunda nomas ungolpe ino era para esa grancaida
Canelos punches he even has soft ones were rocking that  dude
Wat a fight the P4P king Canelo wins
All those  Plant 🪴 people silent right now. Canelo was to slow to put a stop on this one.
Plant was NEVER a threat. I know they have to sell fights, but seriously .. Plant was never going to do anything other than get knocked the fuck out.
Congrats to the mexican worrior saul canelo alvarez,great fight,plant did well but could hang in there after that left hook,then right upper cut,viva mexico!!
King of the 168
Lol Canelo currently at over 500k views lol all the UFC videos under 5k lol
How could you not miss that freaking big ass chin anyway I mean come on man the guy is slow moving he’s going against somebody that’s like fuck it like Godspeed OK
Wanted plant to win but hats off to canelo he earned it fair and square 💯 good fight
Give us Canelo vs Benavidez next.!!
Listen to The arena before he drops him to when he finishes him!! This crowd was crazy !
Canelo was bonified to begin with before this match but damn this was great to watch. I always wished he would've did this to Mayweather but being a undisputed world champion is the ultimate goal not being undefeated.
“Listos pa la chingasos”!!!????🤷🏽‍♂️
Ref: you want to fight?  Caleb: yeah, (but send ginger to his corner, just you and me)
Caleb is a warrior. Canelo is a legend. Props to both hope y’all are safe and mightily compensated
Mexico all day bitch!
He is the real Lion King. Plant was talking shit and Canelo finished that shit. My man has my respect 24/7 he did that. Mexican fighters are great one's at that. We won this shit 🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇😇😇🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤓🤓🤓🤓🤔🤔🤔🤔🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤
This fight got me $200,000 canelo a beast
For plant to have made it all the way to the 11th round is impressive.  I thought he will be out of there by the mid round. Definitely earned my respect, hope he is ok and we see him back in the ring again.
You know when they found out? When it was too late..lol
Can someone explain what this win means in NBA terms
Canelo!!!!
Mayweather would loose if they fought again.
Canelo is beast. Like a lion he finished off the wounded animal.
He’s a bully and a Boss lol
I told y'all he wasn't gonna make it Charlo gotta be shitin his pants
Canelo es una leyenda hizo buen trabajo y le cayó el osico felicidades a canelo
I'm a Lefty and I LEARNED that Nasty leaping Left hook from watching IRON MIKE TYSON and if it's applied correctly GOODNIGHT.  I PUT A DUDE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH ONE OF THOSE AND BELIEVE YOU ME I DIDN'T WANT TO OUT HIM THERE IT JUST HAPPENED WITH ONE PUNCH. BUDDY STIFFENED UP LIKE A BOARD AND FELL LIKE A TREE THEN BANGED THE BACK OF HIS HEAD HARD THEN CAME ALL THAT BLOOD FROM THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. PPL I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED IN MY LIFE BC I THOUGHT I KILLED HIM. GLASSES, TEETH AND ALL WENT FLYING. I DON'T THINK THIS IS FUNNY OR TELLING IT TO SAY I'M TOUGH TRUST ME BC THAT'S NOT ME AT ALL. I LEARNED THAT BULLIES AIN'T SHT AND MOST OF THEM ARE BEING ABUSED BY FATHER, STEPFATHER, MOM'S BOYFRIENDS OR EVEN BY THEIR OWN MOTHER. BUT ANY WAY HRS LATER I CALLED THE HOSPITAL ASKING IF HE WAS OK. WEEKS LATER I WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT ON THAT BOY , WE WERE THE SAME AGE, JUST NOT QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO BUY ALCOHOL...  I ONLY HIT PPL IN SELF-DEFENSE NOW THAT'S IT AND I DON'T EVA WANT TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF I'LL FEELING THAT A PUNCH THAT I THREW COULD'VE KILLED SOMEONE. I'M KICKING 50'S DOOR DOWN WITH BOTH FEET PLUS HAVE A DISABLED WIFE AND 4 YEAR OLD SON
Caleb plant actually had his right hand up for that first left hook that knocked him down ....canelo is just so good at getting through people's guards
I have never heard of Caleb Plant,I just saw right now his highlights and on this fight with Canelo,Plant did NOT fight like his other fights at all!!! He never pushed forward like he did in the other fights and on that first face off you said Mother F to Canelo and alread had a cut under his right eye! Plant you said that is not for the money and people not believing in and such but when you start to insult your other opponents and at almost at the end get knock out,I just hope you ate your words. Remember this always win lose or draw never insult any boxer cause you’ll get what you deserve!
S.o. to Plant.  Canelo just too old, too experienced, too strong, and allowed to use PEDs.
Everyone knew the white guy was gonna lose. Like Chris rock said “the lower you are on the social ladder the better fighter you are”. That’s why boxings dominated by blacks and Mexicans
Puro pinche Mexico
That’s a lot of belts 😬
0:26 how canelo started running after him😂
Canelo is mind strong he carry the power   And patience to tbe end
When canelo RUSHED at him, he literally gave him one of those comic book cartoon punches where I thought caleb was going to float in the air and have his shoes and socks fall off 🤷🏿‍♂️
It was a boring fight but great knock out.....plant wasn’t really fighting back ......I don’t know if he just got out class or he was bought ......but good for Canelo......hopefully that wasn’t the case
4 wins within 11 months..Prettiboi who???? Many who??????🤣🤣🤣
What a fight! Canelo is a beast. King canelo!  Made in Mexico 🇲🇽🙌🏼
Ay why did my boi Canelo walk back up to plant like that like he was saying "Ven aqui cabron te ganaste estos chingasos hijo de su madre!"😂😂😂🤣
Let’s hear 👂 the excuses from so called boxing 🥊fans!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Viva CANELO!!!
Watched it live
No mamen. el oponente de canelo simple y sencillamente quiso ser costal de golpeo para ganar 10 millones. Puro lavado de dinero con el Boxeo!
Plant got planted.
Nobody  left except  charlo brothers
He is not genetically mexican, he’s European
That boiiii 🌱 really felt the power of a mutt race warrior so they say Mexicans are . He’s Mexican 🇲🇽 nothing else nothing less HATERS !!!
Regarding Caleb Plant, some will call it great movement. I call it running 🏃‍♂️. Has a boxer. Had a boxer like Mayweather moved aways like Caleb did, he would have been called a runner.   Mr. Plant was running. He was trying to not get knocked out instead of trying to win fight. His punches looked weak and ineffective compared to Canelos.  Yes, I get it. Facing a boxer with punching power as Canelo you better run. Had Plant fought toe toe, this fight would have been over in less than 6 rounds. Caleb's running, I mean (movement) is what made that knock out take so long.   I give props to Canelo for being very patient and chasing him all damn night. That can be very frustrating to a boxer. But, Canelo remained poised, didn't burn himself out by throwing wild punches out of frustration, and understood that he'll catch him eventually and he did. Very very mature of Canelo. Congrats.
Canelo is a DOG heès the one to beat ièd like to know who will defeat him...not anytime soon
Canelo could fight at a Mortal Kombat tournament & haters would still find something to complain about 😂
KING!!!!!!
Official scores were 96-94(6-4),97-93(7-3),98-92 (8-2) all in favor of canelo at the time of the stoppage.Canelo landed 32.4% of his punches meaning every 1/3 of his punches landed.Caleb landed at 22.9% meaning every 1/4-5 of his punches landed.Canelo outlanded Caleb in 6 rounds while Caleb only 5.However canelo landed with higher accuracy in 9/11 of the rounds.Caleb couldn't even outbox canelo which I'm assuming was his gameplan
GGG
Props to plant!!!!!
Pinche Canelo chingon,q mas viva Mexico Cabrones
After this fight, anybody that says Canelo is ducking Andrade doesn’t know boxing! Canelo just outboxed and KO’d the better “slick” fighter that was out there in Caleb Plant!
You got to an idiot to believe this fight!! Clearly plant took a dive!!!!
mexicanos somos los chingones
Q doce.chavez
Everyone looks good until they fight Mayweather.
Benavidez next.
Beautiful
Congrats to canelo my respect to plant
Told yall leave that nigga alone canelo is just idk man
viva mexico 🇲🇽cavrones
AND Jake Paul wanted to fight Canelo Alvarez. You definitely got no chance on winning against canelo.
Plant punches had no effect on canelo canelo punches was being felt to his soul. Great chicken dance for plant
Its funny how people can't tell when a fight is fixed. Politics in boxing!!! Most people probably never even heard of Caleb plant before this fight was announced but I'm a true boxing fan and Caleb laid down for that check believe me when I tell you. All these guys he's fighting aren't getting any buzz like that so a loss at this point in there career dont matter. That check sets them up nice so stop thinking this dude is pfp.
VIVA CANELO !!!!!! Well done champ 💪🏽🙌🏻💯
Payday! You want payday!
MEXICAN POWER!!!  😜🥊🇲🇽💯
Mexico on top of the boxing world 🌎🇲🇽🥊
Que perro,! Arriva Jalisco Mexico
Mexican's are born fighters salute from somalia ❤💪
He can’t lose
Lucky for canelo before that he was getting worked by plant
I’m extremely happy for Carnelo . Plant tried Mayweathers roper dope snipe type fighting on a real boxer. As far as Canelo loosing to Mayfeather it should not count. Floyd who?
Caleb had NO chance lol
Honestly Plant gave a better fight than I expected, he was fighting good, winning some rounds, respect for him, but Canelo's power is absolutely powerful
Where was the ko? Tko sure...
Rule Supreme, Caaaaaaaaanelo p4p 👑
Hell no he fell he bought that belt fuck that the fall and hit made no sense
Awww….did “sweet hands” get beat😂😂😂
The Final Coup de grâce Body shot was brutal!
00:18 it was at this moment, he knew, he fucked up.
Viva Mexico cabrones!
He Planted the uppercut
Another fake fixed fight 😂
Ggg el único que le metió sus chingasos a canelo  un rival digno
Gotta give Caleb some credit for  being able to take those hits.
Canelo always proves height and reach don't mean shit.
Caleb didn't do bad the entire fight until the 11th rd. He was using a mayweather tactic of jabbing and leaving his glove in Canelos line of sight as a distraction.  Caleb shouldn't of tested canelos strength on the ropes.
He was too big for his own dang self! Was just a huge slow target with massive holes in defense!!once he was stunned that bad.he bacame a zombie. did i say stunned?! more like casually BLASTED into a senile retirement home called "Country Meadows55+ Club", by a perfectly aimed uppercut!! No doubt, Canelo has surpassed Chavez as The Greatest Mexican Boxer/Puncher in my book! See k n Destroy style! no wasted efforts.
Yep I knew it lol
Like I said they talk to much and have big mouth,,now plant got wat he deserves ,,Mexican blood proud,,,viva mexico 🇲🇽 👏 and arriva la raza
This is what it looks like when a greay is down and week canelo said it him self ,!! Congratulations canelo much luv From Dallas 214
Is it just me or the little run Camelot did after Caleb was like when you forget your towel after you hop in the shower lol
Wow
Canelo is a beast
Plant really said "y'all are about to witness me be crowned champion" just to get his aas knocked out by Canelo ☠️😂
Caleb WHO?????
What’s next Canelo!? Good show Caleb.
Maaan,what a good fight! Canelo brakes faces literally,I can't believe he caved in a Boxer's cheek bone,"gruesome" scary in all reality..Wow,dude could of died...
Caleb was winning this Fight
Damn,back then when mayweather was the face of boxing alot of people came to see him loose,But now day that canelo  is the face of boxing people come to see him win is glad to say canelo is the best boxer of his era
This is very boring. Bring back the gladiator games
Asi pense ver a este bocon cubriendo la endanada de un mexicano enfurecido. Entonces pregunto para prendes el cerro
Ever since Mayweather Can't nobody beat Canelo!
I’m not going to lie canelo looked bored in there with Caleb, canelo did look like he couldn’t figure out his angles on Caleb if Caleb had anything for him he could have took advantage of that.
whats the name of the song at 1:07 ?
Caleb ptant a great boxer  Cenelo the best  Thank you both for a great fight 👏 💙 💪
Respect to Caleb. Dude fought his ass off. I’m a canelo fan but I’m a fan of caleb after this fight
I'm just proud. I'm sure he worked for it.
Man the only 2 fighters on Canelos level were Mayweather and GGG. Trilogy with GGG needs to happen.
My favorite part of the entire fight was hearing Canelos amazing sportsmanship. They had some major things planned for celebrating this win but after Plant humbly came to give his praise to canelo, you can hear one of his team members coming up and asking if he wanted to do “it” now. Canelo responded, “No. let’s not after all. Let’s give him his respect.” Pure class!
Hase un mes estuve en México y dudavan del canelo...lo demostro ez un gallito,,la velocidades de ese muchacho ea incredible...les demostro al final ..lo tumbo canelo mis recpeto..saludos de la vieja escuela de cuba
Canelo will never fight Benavidez or Beterbiev
If this is Caleb’s first knock down of his career it’s no shame that it’s to Papi-Canelo 😂🤗😘 🥳🎉🍾👑
I didn't think that moment would come. Plant was making it very difficult. It wasn't  his style, but his unwillingness to let his hands go, which meant fewer chances for Canelo to make him pay for his mistakes. Either way, Canelo was winning. Doesn't matter how great Plant was defensively if he isn't doing much else.
I should've called in work for this fight 😔
Where you at Andre ward
Viva México Cabrones 🇲🇽💪 Viva El Canelo 💪🇲🇽💯 México se Respeta !!!!🥊🥊💯🍺🍻💪
Fierroooooooo!!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽❤😍😍😍Que bonito se acosto sobre la cuerda
😂 this fight seemed faker than the kovelev fight it's about rewarding the largest boxing fans with their own champions to grow the sport... instead of putting on the best performances they would rather just promote canelo who clearly got his ass whooped by erislandy Laura who is a little too dark to promote...I hate canelo dude couldn't even drop Floyd or GGG, Jacobs but all of the sudden he just washes people with power?? This shit so rigged WTF...and people know it too..you just have to much racial pride to admit it and this is coming from a Mexican born man...damn this sport sucks now...
Stop the clowns
The man literally can't carry all his belts at once. They had them draped over him and he needed a guy to finally hold the last one up cause there was actually just no more room on him...
He talked shit too much he deserved it
Hay plant what happened to all that talk that you are going to ko Alvarez and he is not in your class what happened i know you are not running your mouth now. Good luck body on your next fight remember the only reason you lost is because you insult Alvarez you made him mad abd give him that eage that he needed  next time wach what comes out of your mouth.
Viva Mexico cabrones I El Nuevo PFP Rey Saul Canelo Alvarez.
Wtf are all those belts he’s holding at the end ??
Thanos strikes again
Respect for plant 🙏
Canelo is the fucking MAN!!!!!!!
Man we need a fair GGG and canelo rematch every fight was called bogus on both ends let’s these brothers really show whose best
Watching a legend making history
Whoever thought that the fight was going to turn out any other way just because Caleb was bigger with a longer reach was just a person who knows absolutely NOTHING about boxing and what Canelo brings to the table. He's your first undisputed ...MEXICO STAND UP!!!!!!!
Plant did good. Canelo did Great.
Viva El Canelo Y que Viva México 🇲🇽  HDSPM 💪
Oye se Rubio!!!
Canelo is a beast ,props to caleb for not quitting
Arriba canelo cabrones
I have love for Canelo, but our American champion Mayweather schooled him and say what you want, still doesn’t take away the fact that Mayweather beat him and Canelo will never get the chance to prove himself against him again
Viva mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽
Canelo is just too good. I didn't like him at first but now I'm a huge fan. He's an absolute killer and definitely up there as one of the best
We all knew Canelo would be too much for plant.  Great ending to this fight.
Mike was right,  smashed.
Chavez the best would love to clone hem !!!!! Simple The best of the best
The best part is that I would destroy Alvarez 😂😂😂
What is the title of the song that first played ?
Canelo vs Benavidez
Caleb has great defense just not enough power to be a threat to Canelo or even make Canelo be cautious.  Great fight.
Whoever bet on plant , you deserved to lose money!! How dare you bet against Canelo !!!!
I saw Caleb outbox Canelo - made him look pretty bad - for 8 out of the 11 rounds.  His only issue was that he didn't command the center of the ring enough.
I like Plant, he did way better than I expected.
All the Dislikes are from biased blacks and racist americans #Facts
Clinical strikes. Imagine going 11 rounds and getting hit like that? Would suck the life outta me if not the cardio itself 💀
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES !!!
Plant should be damn proud of himself! Took him to the 11th. Wondering how far Charlo will push Canelo.
What he deserves tho
Caleb is talented but he is just not ready for Canelo now. As at now, only Canelo is ready for Canelo. Someone at prime Mayweather or prime Manny’s level fighting the same division can be a challenge but there is non right now.
Jake Paul Where You At???? Your next!!!!
Can I just say. We all respect what these fighters go through but ain’t no way y’all talking more about respect for Caleb over acknowledging one of the greatest middleweights of all time.   I swear, idk how y’all manage to minimize all that he has accomplished in his career yet use him to congratulate fighters for even lasting more than 10 rnds with him. Y’all are missing it smh
Ref: you wanna fight? Plant: yeah Ref: ok Plant's face : awww fk
Tell me which other boxer fights  like canelo walking his opponents and destroying then like this. Don't ever tell me nothing about Mayweather Gtfoh with that. This man canelo is a the real deal COMPETE BOXER! NOT JUST DEFENSE.
The goat don’t @me
There's guys way more difficult than house plant. This was a tuner fight.
When Caleb did that weird combo that connected I knew it was over because canelo was pissed off that he let himself get hit with something like that
EL QUE OFENDE A MÉXICO SE METE EN PROBLEMAS
Just how I thought canelo went to work in the garden and planted plant to his final resting place lmao he got knock the fuck out
Finally a fight that wasn't rigged Canelo won fair and square He was all up on His opponent In the first round you could have tell he was going to win he was more offensive
He put that plant in the dirt 😂😂😂😂
I believe canelo wanted to end the fight late jus to give the crowd a show like he did against Saunders. He put on a clinic when he finally let loose. Broke his body down then got to the face. Y’all are witnessing GREATNESS!!!
This looked like mayweather vs canelo but with a kd and a tko
Only show "canelo money ""....$$$$$$
Well tomato 🍅 plant got fuck up.lol.
Yo why Canelo run like that after Caleb 🤣🤣🤣 funniest shit ever!! All I could hear in my head when he did was “Come ‘er boy” great job to canelo 💪🏾
That’s why you don’t talk about a Mexican mans mom you just got your ass kicked plant lmao ps don’t compare TN to Mexico every again
Charlo want 0 smoke 😂😂😂😂
Wrong game for poor plant .
What a year for combat sports wow!!!
Props to Caleb, he gave canelo a good fight and took it like a man
All the racist mother crappers out there hating the fact that he’s Mexican 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that burns 🥵
Plant proved many people were wrong even though he lost, he did really good all 11 rounds, really good fight and I’m a canelo fan but I give credit where credit is due!!!
one of my favorite parts is that mike tyson and dave chappelle were there which was amazing.
Man was that an amazing finish to the fight! Props to Caleb for starting out good moving and jabbing around. But he started fading later in the fight due to canelos constant pressure and attacks to the body against the ropes. Canelo really was going for the KO. You can tell canelo was sorta tired too but eventually that left hook connected and the uppercut followed. Kingnelo has done it. 🔥 🧑🏻‍🦰👑🇲🇽 💯🇲🇽🔥
Hoooly siiiiii hoomennnnnnn
Let’s fuckin go!!!
Nice fight much respect 2 both fighters both men 4 sho canelo just a tab betta no Shame Caleb this is Howe u show luv without hatred learn somethin new idiots we don’t have 2 b divisive let’s promote unity 1 hell of a fight canelo n Caleb ✌🏿✌🏾✌🏽✌️✌🏼✌🏻
No one gonna fuck with Canelo !  Canelo is the GOAT ! Canelo is the King of the Ring !
Never run from the smoke he wasn't conditioned enough Jermall better take notes and see what he up against
I hope Canelo doesn’t go out like Julio Cesar Chavez. Both great Mexican 🇲🇽 fighters.
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH WE ARE THE REAL JEWS
Canelos a starved man looking for food. Come fight night he's a werewolf that smells your blood.
He hasnt ever been hit like that. Caleb isnt on his level at all. He felt that power and started retreating lol.
And ppl still get upset when I say that Floyd just couldn't beat him right now back then yes but now I don't see one of these boxers right now that can including Floyd and that's 💯
i feel like canelo didnt train as hard as he usually does for this fight. man is an animal
Congratulations Canello and Mexico 💯💯💯
Canelo goat status !!!!! Long live the pound for pound king of the planet!!!! 🥊🇲🇽👑
Plant is a joke he talk all that cash then got knocked out by that fool canelo. I wanted plant to win
Too easy
el peooooor boxeo del mundo
RESPECT TO CALEB PLANT FOR BEING THE BIGGER MAN AN TELLING CANELO WHATEVER THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER DIED IN THE RING, THAT'S TRUE SPORTSMANSHIP AND CALEB YOU GOT A NEW FAN, I HONESTLY THINK CALEB WOULD BEAT BENAVIDEZ!
"Mexican Roky Marciano"😎👍🍺🍺
Yo no cap plant was getting up and would've been up in 10 seconds I know he probably would have got knocked down again but I mean there has got to be a universal standard in boxing because when Deontay knocked out Fury the ref didn't wave it off and that was the most vicious KO
Tonight he went down in history. Solidified Legendary status
Other boxing bag for canelo ....... boxing is sucks,today.......
When you got more belts than arm and waist space you know you’re doing it right.
When trash talking goes wrong lmao
🤦‍♂️ To all the canelo haters. When r they gonna learn this guy is nothing to play with
One thing no one notices is how many punches that look like don't connect from canelo actually do . He actually aims alot for the left arm elbow bicep area . Look at Caleb's arm . Its not the first time he does that tactic. One of the very small details he does that chips  away at the opponent
That’s his wife? Wowza. He needs for nothing, does he!
Apparently Plant was doing all his fancy defensive training but they never went over what to do when you get into deep water.  The second he was hurt he turtled up like he had no idea what do do.
He looks great against whiteboys and non top 10 competition...causal fans don't understand those belt don't mean shit especially when u didn't clean out ur division
Canelo got to throwing them 🔨 🔨  https://youtu.be/Hm4VE0ZqE9g
🗑
Caleb had a great defense way better fighter than I thought.
i don’t understand plant he did a really good job but if your hurt why run? why not try and really recover instead he runs across the ring props to both of them
Only Jalisco #1 takes care of business. The rest of you are just full of shit.
This was a good ass fight didn’t see the KO coming tbh Plant was a tough one. Salute to Plant and his camp.
UNDEFEATED CANELO !!!!!!!  FUCK ALLTHEHATERS
:25 secs light on mike watchn canelo in kill mode.....fuckn GOLD💯💯💯
Recuerdas paquia hagarrabas puro mexicano viejito dónde estas ahora canelo te busca
This is Canelo's time. Enjoy. Can not be denied.
We are blessed to watch the last two main events, bringing  respect back to boxing
Looks like Benavides is next, best time for Canelo cause Benavides is only gonna get better. Close to age when he fight Mayweather.
Best $80 I ever spent 😂
Canelo delivered again...
Lots of people were saying BJS performance is gonna be better but Plant performed way better than BJS did and im not surprised because Plant is a champ for a reason but Canelo is just too great and i hope people wont be too hard on Plant because the man just tryna sell the fight, yeah he said some things before the fight but he was just tryna sell it and theres no shame losing to one of the greatest boxers in the world. Caleb is good but Canelo just too great.
VIVA MEXICO CARBONES🍻🇲🇽
Dónde estas Paquiaooo te busca canelo
Andy ruiz didn’t have any reaction to canelo knocking out plant 😭
Muxooos huevosss🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚
I want to know how Andre Ward was sooooooo off on his prediction.  Seem like he’s a canelo hater.  He picked Plant by ko lol.
Tells you how great Floyd Mayweather is. He beat this white Mexican!
Good performance by plant with the jabs but Canelos urgency kicked in and that left hook ain't no joke
Ala Cherga
Canelo felicidades hermano puro cabron
Benavidez would of take him out faster than Canelo
NOW THIS FIGHT REALLY PUT MAYWEATHER IN TOP OF MOUNTAIN. CANELO COLD NO-1 GONE BEAT HIM. YALL SEE HOW FLOYD DID HIM,
Andy Ruiz watching patiently. 👀👀👀 Viva Mexico Cabrones!!!!
This version of Canelo would have beat Floyd in 2014 oh wait Floyd would have made excuses not to fight him 💯🤡🤣
CANELO ALWAYS FIGHTING OLD FOOLS NEVER HEARD OF SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️ #JUSTSAYING
Oh my GAWD!!! lmfao you can hear Canelo roaring after every punch and not to mention the way he ran up on him, gawDAMN LOL! Badass!
Very High Respect For Caleb Plant man.. He really did his thing though although i didn't expect him to get knocked out he really had a good fight i tip my hat to him RESPECT💯
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermon!
If Caleb had power this could have been very different. He's an incredible boxer and really fun to watch.
Look at my comments long before this fight that I did not think would go 10 rounds! He went after Plant ad he did to Billy Joe Sanders! CANELO just born to fight! He will be.ok for another 2 , 3 years.. wish CANELO could fight Mayflower Floyd jr now even for a expedition bout! Gayweather Floyd jr fans will use the excuse , oh Floyd jr too old ! He declares to be king always! Mexican CANELO is really destructive now! He looks more faster than more sharp with attacks! Plant put up a fight like a man but CANELO found his openings! Good fight than to see BORING Mayflower Floyd jr!
What was that Caleb ??? O u silent o ok then
Viva la raza canelo family and friends always keep you strong and healthy ,(nothing like professional boxing)
That’s exactly right who has the number one king of the world on boxing, that’s right mfrs  that piece of shit was nothing for him!!  Go  “Canelo”
It is such a time to be in Vegas right now🤑🤑🤑
And Jake Paul really thinks he can beat canelo in a fight good luck with that
Canelo is a " Real example of being LATINO." You want to be LATINO, you must replicate CANELO example. Canelo is 100% Zero Drugs in his career as boxer. HUMBLE and Faithful to God. Canelo is 100 % discipline.
RIGHT NOW THERE’S NO ONE WHO CAN BEAT CÁÑELO…. PERIOD
This dude lasted longer than Billy and that's all I have to say with all heart !
El mejor de mexico ahora mismo y de el mundo viva mexico awuebo
Plants gonna so exactly what canelo did after he lost to floyd. Plants gonna get better and clean house just like canelo ended up doing
I see a mayweather effect here   Canelo took his loss and became who he is today I see plant doing the same.    Triple g didn’t even stun him and plant did I believe Caleb plant will come to be a big super star after this. Proud of him for such a solid performance.
WHOA! 😮
Good fight Canelo that dude upper cut was something serious plant did the dash literally  My God lol
had Plant winning by a round until that KO, Canelo always struggles against natural smooth operators until he booms them lol
So the same reff that let fury get up from a second knock down didn't give plant that same opportunity to get up his second knock down? Be consistent thats all....
Come on now......canelo losr to mayweather and came back....just watch how plant comes back from this. After canelo lost to floyd they said he wasnt a top tier fighter. Caleb plant will be champion again nobody else does this to plant
And those internet stupid kids really thinks they can Stan in the same ring with canelo 😝😝😝
Now its time for Mr PED's to fight a real fighter in adopted Canadian Beterbiev. Instead of cherry picking cans.
Plant came n did his thing! Respect hope to see more after this loss! Hope this L helps u build u didn’t lose to a chump fighter your only loss is to a true champion that been in your shoes n used that L to be were he at right now hope u could do the same!💯
To be expected
Yet he won’t fight GGG again? He keeps fighting scrubs
Lions, Hyenas, Wild Dogs: Canelo, we liked the way you chased your prey for the kill!!
Andrade , charlo, benavidez don’t stand a chance.
Did anyone really expect something different. After round 4, plant with off his bike 🚲 and rolling on his scooter 🛴 instead. Those body shots took a toll. Plant didn’t have the power to earn Canelos respect and as the fight went on, his power diminished. A few times Canelo dropped his hands and played with plant. He also put his back on the ropes and called plant in. Canelo was just too much for 🪴
Them Canelo shorts Raw asl
That side stance worked for a few rounds but he was so predictable in later rounds with the same move , I literally called the knockout punch for punch move for move .
Jake Paul quite after this fight 😂
canelo made him feel something special
No boxing no life. Puro pinchi Canelo 🥊💪
Canelo p4p number 1 undisputed champion number one Mexican Boxer all time
🤣🤣🤣 Humbled this chump!!! Canelo a beast.
Canelo puez viva 🇲🇽
This fight was hella good.. I have to tip my hat to plant.. he fought good..but Canelo has that killer punch 🤛.😎💯
POUND 4 POUND 👑
2:00 look at Andy Ruiz in the bottom right 😂
168.
As long  Canelo is under contract with TheZone, he will never loose otherwise no one will follow his fights. TheZone gave him a contract of like 11 years to fight all his promotions. Definitely there are fighters that can win against him, but this is boxing, business, lies and money. No matter What happens in one of any of those fights, all fighters will fight to loose not to win against Canelo, because they all are paid to not defeat him. Same as Mayweather  with him being the Promoter !!! That’s silly
Beautiful performance
Took a dive
Canelos fine ass.
Canelo could be the reason mayweather dont want to fight....but Plant won every round. a knock out is simply a lucky punch.All rounds were stolen anyway. round  1 2 3 4 were all plants
VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽!!!! P4P CANELO!!!!1🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
But plant gonna outbox him though 😂
2:07 andry ruiz in the back
So we know the mayweather formula doesn't work on canelo anymore. Why on earth would Plant try that knowing Canelo lost to that style and had many years to refine himself based on that loss.
Que putisa y por un mex no mames
Mike Tyson called it.
If u aren’t a Fan after Canelo’s latest performance… u’ll be a LameHater till ur very last breath
Caleb was a warrior in the ring and gracious in defeat. Gotta respect the humility, a rare quality with boxers nowadays. #CaneloEra is in motion. Undisputed and a historic night in many ways. 💪🏼💯
Referee “you want to fight” Plant “YES!” Canelo “ I was sure hoping you would say that”
CANELO did say theirs levels to this and proved it 👑
Exactly the point of fight I thought he would get blasted out. Plant was strong and durable tough guy though.
Canelo es la mera vena!!👏👏👏👏
PLANTED!
Canelo- VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!  Don’t mess with Mexico, USA can’t even get in there so that should say enough bye ! (FBI, etc)
Ever since canelo fought mayweather, everything changed for him.
Imagine watching this instead of UFC 268. Nice knockout from Canelo though. He’s a different type of beast
good for Plant. he gave a great fight 🇺🇸🇲🇽
Plant deserves nothing but respect 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 good fight congratulations for canelo 🙏🏻
We are watching a modern day Mexican Mike Tyson in his Prime
Plant is a bum… barely threw combinations that Canelo would have to deal w/ kept throwing that jab Canelo did not respect. Didn’t even bother to switch it up at all w/ a double jab or use his right hand. Got walked down all night knew it would end w/ a KO after rd 2
I gotta say Caleb  plant you impressed me with your boxing skills are superb I thought this was gonna be one sided but Caleb made Canelo work for that ko great fight
He rocked his shit
That was an early stoppage
Good fight I felt canelo would win from the beginning but Caleb definitely earned respect tonight.
Def much respect to plant, awesome fight!
Lo digo y lo sigo diciendo canelo le tiene que ganar a charlo o benavidez para quedar como el más grande
No mas!!!!!!! Baby!!!!
VIVA MEXICO RAZA 🇲🇽CANELO #1 🥊👍
Plant is a b**ch ...period  He should have stayed and accepted defeat instead he walked away like a pu**y...
Plant could have won. He really did put up a great fight
He hunted the prey and brought it to Eddy Reynosa, knocked him out right infront of Eddy 🔥🔥🥊🥊
Ref. Wanna fight? Caleb. Yeah Ref. Canelo he's all yours
The 5 brandon fan boys , deplorables and cohorts all came out of the woodwork to represent TN.
Should of gave him a chance he did get up
You got to love the way that announcer I don't know his name but the way he announces it he sounds old School
😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats to canelo. He did what he had to do. That being said, those score cards were criminal. I had plant up by more than 2 rounds before the stoppage. Those judges were a joke
Fantastic win my Canelo. Made history tonight! He's basically accomplished all his goals available.  Only fight I see that makes since is against GGG to finish with a specutular finish
Respect for Caleb he proved to be a warrior and a very talented guy 💯🙌 also congratulations to the king👑canelo.
It's the Irish blood
It was the left hook that hurt him uppercut put him down the first time he went down
Pound 4 pound....Time 2 Get Wit "BUD "
Undesputed. Wow
"you not on my level" -Canelo.
I knew this was gonna happen, canelo won.

NBF! NO BLACK FIGHTERS!! HE WILL NEVER BE THE GREATEST UNTIL HE FIGHTS THE LIKES OF BENAVIDEZ, ANDRADE, OR CHARLO! UNTIL THEN HE IS THE EUROPEAN ASSASSIN!🤣🤣🤣
The  commentator is so annoying.
That 💉💊power
Respect to plant for  giving his best.  VIVÍA MÉXICO 🇲🇽
I didn’t think Plant could take the punches.
Mexican Hamburger is a helláva drug
Bro slap canelos head 💀
Stop fucking playing with that man fucking different been breaking down Caleb’s fighting style for a min results always the same!!! Levels to this shit!!!
That was fun to watch and im glad to see they made peace afterwards. Good effort by Caleb fighting Canelo!
The Mexican style of boxing is just too much for opponents sometimes. This is a good example
Wohoo! Another win for Canelo Alvarez! 👍 🇲🇽
CANELO IS THE BEST!!!
Canelo planted plant
viva mexico
Canelo vs Usman make it happen!
00:04 Andy just smiling in the background lol
CANELO ALVAREZ will ko Charlo ALOT QUICKER
Back to the trailer park for you plant
Caleb “sweeter hands” Plant after taking bribe money 💰. That was a horrible acting display by Plant. Plant gets no Oscar awards from me
Canelo may never taste defeat again. It’s that simple. He different bruh.
2:08 Andy Ruiz in the back sitting there watching all chill
Legendary moment I knew canelo was going to win but I’m surprised how long plant lasted he’s a good fighter he shouldn’t be getting all this hate
That chase tho, Canelo ran to him… goosebumps lol
Canelo mis respetos los mexicanos somos unos Guerreros aztecas emos  tenido grandes boxeadores tú estás entre ellos
The announcer was annoying asf
caleb plant was right we were going to see him november 6 get tko
Like I been saying ...us Mexicanos...king fucken sangre...what's up
Mexican Viking !!🇲🇽
Big respect to Caleb Plant brave, skilled, talented he did a good job at least way better than Calum and Saunders combined. Hope he can back stronger.
Pinche canelo aver si manda llamar el tata Martino para este fin de semana para chingarnos a Estados Unidos.
Good for Saul  Always loved that kid.
First time seeing someone sprint in the ring 👊
Felicidades nelito.mi rey.bby y yo nos.sentimos orgullosos.de.canelooooooo..viva mexico!.
Man, this is Caleb Plant's "Canelo-Mayweather" fight
You heard it 🗣 King Canelo 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I’ve seen real fighters when get hurt, they fight back by swinging real hard and giving it all and hoping for that one big shot that can change the fight, Caleb ain’t that person. He got hit, went down and all he want is to survive.
Canelo that champion that needs his coach to hold some belts
Canelo is the G.O.A.T!
Canelo took it easy on Plant for some reason he could have walked through Plant!
Canelo movement is so solid and powerful!
Yea how about GGG vs Canelo 🏃‍♂️
Caleb just looked over powered the entire fight. Yeah he got in a few good punches, but Canelo was just drilling him all night with body punches. Just like Chavez use to do it
Good job  Canello nice  knock out
King Canelo. Good work sir and congratulations.
He have to fight Jake Paul to prove he’s the goat
The ref was like “u wanna fight?!” Plant: yeah! Ref: Oooookay (like he knew he f*kd)
Canelo turned Sweet Hands into Sweet Cheeks!
Honestly plant threw the fucking fight he didn't even look rocked at the end looked like he just threw himself but hey people will say I'm a hater
Low man wins
Canelo is pissing money now.
canelooooooo 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 vamos mejicooooo
Did Canelo RUN to Caleb when he was hurt?? Canelo DOESN'T get tired @ ALL NOW??? 👀👀👀 That is super human
Canelo is just like the barber shop.....NEXT!!! This guy's on a different level.
Undisputed???? Floyd whipped his ass
Caleb showed heart getting up the first time, but didnt leave the ref no chance because he got clocked with the first punch canelo threw.
I guess Andre Ward helping Caleb out didn't work out
Caleb plant ain't shit... Canelo still cherry picking... Fight the elite guys bc this shit is not impressive
He got folded like a chair 💀
Respect for Plant for fighting valiantly.  But, Canelo has just matured to perfection. No punches, time, or energy is wasted. Congratulations Canelo for another great win!
This is exactly what would happened if jake Paul were to fight canelo.
Caleb was not lying about being in the best shape of his life ! He took canelos body shots well ! I knew they affected him in the later rounds but props to him for coming in at such good condition! Body could only take so much before it starts to just shut down
Lol this is what we do. We put our heart in everything. Nothing new.  Viva Mexico. Always.
Lol he was running away
Canelo is too much
Canelo legit put him out right in front of his family and team!!! They got the best view of Caleb getting Planted to the ground 😂
Canelo brilliant fighter throws left hooks first half of the fight, then starts throwing beautiful right hooks. Man is a genius or common sense
before the fight: saying f bombs on plant… will lose etc.  after: my hats go off to plant for putting up a fight and stepping in the ring with the king, p4p in the world, he’s earned his respect from canelo. hell of a fight plant and canelo! #canelo #p4p #mexico #undisputed
Who here after the fight watching to not spend money on this fight
That’s what happens when you run your mouth and ain’t ready for the 💨. Get ran through Plant hahahahaha
Ahki tv and deontays boxing nation is looking dumb af right about now. 1st fury vs wilder and now canelo becoming undisputed. This is canelo era. Period
Jajaj viva mexico cabrones
The Great Ginger Mexican Hope!!!!
Imagine getting fucked up by a Mexican wearing dolce Gabbana 🤣 🤣 🤣  plant knew this was coming everyone did he really should have just fedex the belt over lmao avoid losing brain cells lmao least he got a check bro canelo says no hard feelings after the fight but any man who literally runs in the ring after someone is a man who took those insults personally yall seen  canelo 🏃‍♂️  to caleb across they don't teach that in boxing  they teach that shit in the streets 😂
Mad respect for Caleb plant 🙏🏽 He is a such a good boxer!! Congrats to the champs kingnelo 🤴 No boxing 🥊 no life
Lmao the way he went back to his corner 🤦🏽‍♂️
Hahahahaha hahahahaha Can’t fuck with a Mexican thank you for my $3.000
Canelo planted the seeds indeed.
Thank you Canelo he even deserved more viva Canelo Guate is with you.
Fucking proud of this reign, UNDISPUTED IN 1 YEAR
That left hook was beautiful...but that uppercut was vicious
Saludos a MEXICO 🇲🇽 CANELO ✅
Be honest. Caleb Plant won every round until Canelo caught him. If he would have played it safe those last 2 rounds, he wouldve walked away with a split decision.
¡ VIVA MEXICO CABRONES !
his chin was no match for canelo fist  Dont call canelo a motherf$#!&@ 👊💥💫💤💤🛌 🤕 He got a nice big slice of that humble pie  That everyone's been eating 😋
0:30 I thought he almost knocked the ref out
Shoutout to Plant for getting in the ring with that bull
💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Mexico 🇲🇽 is sending their BEST ! 👍
It’s funny you can tell in the crowd who bet against canelo their face like 😧 canelo is the best boxer right now
Ref. Come here you wanna get knocked down? Plant yeah. Ref ok.
Canelo 🇲🇽 ♥️
Viva Mexico mi respetos
Regardless of anything that's his throne well deserved
I did not even bothered to watch this fight because the outcome was so predictable.
Canelo is awesome in and out of the ring!! And bleep that catch weight 150lbs chicken weather loss!! If chicken weather fights that at 154 Canelo destroys him! David Benavidez is the one guy that could give Canelo a true test and should be Canel’s next fight in may👊🏻✌🏻
He definitely has all of the infinity stones now.
Where are all the Plant supporters/Canelo haters!!! I told you fools you’d better be there help carry his big ass out!!!
Why you don't say mother fucker. Lol
Next lesson at ur nearest gym Philly shell
Plant said Cotto's brother made Canelo do the chicken dance. Canelo made Plant do the chicken dance an 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ before getting KO'd. He literally ran.🤣🤣🤣🤣
U N D I S P U T E D
All he has to do now is fight a REAL fighter and stop ducking Charlo and BENAVIDES!!!!
Burgers king 🤴
I don’t really think that there’s anyone out there who truly believed  that plant  could win. I’ll have to admit, though. Plant didn’t go in there scared- he truly tried
Oh course he would beat the guy he chose to beat.
On another level 👍
LMAO
and people are still gonna say canelo cheated lmaoo ESO ES TODO KING CANELO!!🇲🇽🇲🇽
There’s no stopping Canelo Alvarez
Cuando derrote bien a GGG y a Maywether agarra puro Bulto
Plant is trash
😂😂😂😂😂 otro costal más sigan coperando los q creen el súper canelo lastima q ya no aiga marquez barreras chavez morales etc
Let be honest, we all knew Canelo was gonna have Caleb's face planted on the ring.
Canelo is 👑
A rematch is necessary. Plant wasn't tired and Canelo wasn't tired. Plant wasn't hurt and neither was Canelo. Plant wasn't phased by Canelo's punches and Canelo wasn't phased by plants punches. Plant was dodging and blocking most of Canelo's punches. Plant was playing taps and working the score card. All of the sudden Canelo gets this weird lucky shot when the fight is damn near over???? Let's be real, that could have been either of them. Canelo needs to beat him again to prove it was the better man and not a pure miracle of luck. To be honest that fight decision could have gone any where from a draw to a split decision to either fighter. People will say different and act like Canelo had a full proof last second knockout plan and had it covered. Let's be real, that win ain't satisfying for a one time fight. Gotta win twice. Rematches are for close fights. One time fights are for brutal unmatched defeats.
PED = PLANT EATS D...K
Plant tanto se cuidó de esa izquierda pero ya a lo último no pudo. Todo tiempo plant con buena guardi asta que canelo dijo defiéndete por que voy 😁😁😂😂😂
You wanna fight?   Yea, oh nvm
Paul brothers want NO 💨 with Canelo a real POUND FOR POUND BOXER!!!
Thank you everyone from all parts of the World for your Praises for My Boy Canelo Alvarez I see not everyone is the same,that all races are different but this shows me they not gonna get butthurt and act on Hate and Racism that being said us Canelo fans know how Great and Humble Saul Canelo Alvarez is for Real he is a Different Kind of Breed of Boxer born and raised in Mexico Hecho en Mexico!!!!! Eso es y que Viva Mexico!!!!!! Feel soo damnnn Pround of being Mexican!! And for Canelo he is a Beast and is the King of Boxing,the People's Champ just goes to show you that God has Blessed him with a Great Gift.
Good fight night money well spent!
never talk about this man's mama again.
A New Wbc belt
It’s not until that perfect angle you see why Plant went down. Mid fall/duck Canelo hit Plant like 5 times right on the button through the guard!! So dope!!!!
Canelo is like Thanos easily collecting his infinity gem stones.
Congrats to Canelo, but I think all know who the greatest of this era was. Mayweather, Pac-man, Canelo.
Strange that the entire ending sequence is here for free from Showtime so soon after the fight.
asta los comentators get paid la hacen de emocion wueyes
Clenboy now can fight for 12 rounds without getting tired. Steroid boy is good again.
Who the Hell is Plant????? Canelo stay far away from black fighters
It was the 11th round with only a min a few seconds left. They could have let the fight go on. But yet again they give it to the cash cow. They didn’t except plant to last that long, they didn’t want anything happening in the last round.
The longer Canelo goes on winning and winning the better Mayweather looks.
Legend
ALL HAIL KING CANELO
keep paying for the fights stupids make him richer pendejos
All the bias canelo haters are beating their heads in right now xD
Canelo will always be known as a roid user. His legacy will always be tainted.  Fuck cheaters
All that 🗑talk got him what you get when you fuck wit a real Mexican king.....
Canelo: I AM INEVITABLE 👌💥
I want Jake Paul vs Canelo
MAYWEATHER needs to rematch CANELO asapppp
Where’s all those YouTube experts that said Canelo was gonna lose..where are y’all snowflake’s at?!! Fucking haters!!
Shouldn't of been talking shit
We need ggg vs canelo 3 asap! Ggg the only one to stand toe to toe and give canelo a true fight!
Anyone know what the name of the song is at 2:06
Canelo did that!
Great and all but when is canelo going to fight Frank Reynolds the trash man! That is the $$$ fight stop ducking him alvarez you coward!!!😆😆
I think triple G is the only one that can put canelo in serious trouble right now
you can see Mike Tyson in the background smiling lmao
Looking at Canelo, it's so obvious he takes steroids
Canelo gracias un orgullo Mexicano.
Plant put up a great fight. Commentators were biased and the scorecards were outrageous. I had plant winning the first half of the fight!
Congrats Canelo!!! 🔥
No me convenció ese roson que canelo dio para que plant según se descontrolara parece todo arreglado siempre canelo con sus victorias dudosas
Canelo is very very good to all boxers who doesn't want to move their heads much. Unlike Mayweather who moves and counters and that frustrated Canelo. 😁😁
All those Plant fans in the comments before the fight got real quite. 😂😂🤫🤫
When Caleb got knocked down the first time, when he gets up he runs straight to his corner to get saved..he knew what was coming..when the ref asked him do you wanna fight of course he said yes but he knew that was a bad decision...canelo cMe in and unloaded the clip!!! What a effin fight! Good way to finish 2021
The multiple belts thing is so fucking confusing.
Caleb plant fought a good fight never really seen him fight but mad respect to him
Gente pendeja se emociona por una pura pelea q no tiene chiste
Much respect to plant he did really good tbh I didn’t expect him to last long
Andre Ward, I'm waiting....  #PLANTado #VanillaIce
Thank you just saved me 80 lol plant just wasn't mentally ready id like to see plant fight GGG next if canelo doesn't
🇲🇽🥊👑
El Rey 🤴
I'm waiting for the haters comments.
All that trash Plant was talking and he got knocked out
Nobody Fans: give praises to a fighter whos on a eurooean tour to duck black fighters with talent
my god the way he weaved the jabs and then the hook simply beautifuly
Yes I know he has an L but I would put money in it that Canelo moves passed Mayweather status. The guy is absolute monster but unlike Mayweather, he's fun to watch and puts on a fucking show every single time.
Congratulations to Canelo, you did exactly what everyone expected you to do. Hopefully in your next fight you will choose an opponent who's not all fluff. 168 is one of the weakest divisions in boxing and that's why Canelo continues to fight in this division.
Truly Undisputed. TBE.  A Title Mayweather never had.  😂🤣😂
GGG 2-0 against Canelo
Plant didn’t use his assets to his advantage. Hardly through the right and def did not keep the separation with the long jab. Plant’s corner let him down. Great fight though.
I'm sure Caleb will be champ in the future, this is the mayweather-canelo moment of his career
Watching Canelo’s left hook land in super slow-motion is fucking awe inspiring
Plant didnt look bad in the beginning Canelo is just a different breed man🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤙🏾🤙🏾
At 0:22 Canelo became a scorpion haha 🦂
They way Canelo ran up on him after the knockdown 🐐
GGG beat canelo
Plant is a punk and I’m glad canelo showed him what’s a real boxer 😂 viva 🇲🇽Mexico
Where the plant fans 😂😂😂smoking on the 🌱 pack
Didnt see this coming lmao what a joke
Are they still going to put crawfish infront on the p4p list after this performance by canelo🤣🤣🤣
Fake
Ref: you wanna fight??  Plant: yeah!   I think plant thought that the ref wanted to fight him instead of canelo 🤔😂😂
Y yo creo que julio César quiciera un hijo como canelo que responda que deje el apellido en alto pero julito y Omar ya valieron por eso mismo julio César Chávez reconoce que canelo es un gran peleador
He had no business in the ring with Canelo ROFL! said it day 1 and held true
Canelo is wack why is he fighting all this robots? All these boys stiff ass hell he Just tags them all day
Canelo was watching Roy Jones highlights before this fight.  I recognize the RJJ knock him out shuffle 🤣
Canelo is simply on steroids , this guy is a joke and will be caught eventually. Pathetic trash.
#NBF
Plant was running away from this man wow😂🤣🤣😂 so much for all that shid talking
Canelo > Mayweather
People talking trash that the division Canelo just cleared is weak: Canelo is fighting anybody and just cleared that division of boxers who are significantly bigger than him. He's p4p king. No argument
Impressive. But let's see how  he does against Obama.
2:59 Transiton from latin music to Way Too Sexy by Future as Plant hits the floor is way too funny.  Respect to both men for this entertaining and historic match.
This fabulous fight makes me even prouder to be a Mexican Viva La Raza 🇲🇽💪
nobody goes the distance with Canelo unless you’re floyd mayweather
ALLL HAIL KING STEROIDS!!!
Canelo  🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 the goat
He attacks like angry bull , 👑
Plant fought his ass off and didn't quit. My hats off to him for going nearly 11 with Canelo......but I called it. Canelo is the better fighter and there's levels to that man. Noticed they were on different levels at the press conference awhile back
https://youtu.be/07kwF5oYNYc
He doesn’t owe us anything. He really doesn’t.
cannel too much for these guys but respect to Plant though he performed waaaaay better than I thought he would
Canelo Grinded the Hell outta Plant and Plant got Planted On The Floor...
Caleb Plant did better than everyone thought, but Canelo is just too strong and was hungrier!!!! Viva México 🇲🇽 CABRONES!!!!
I'm gonna go back and look at all the caleb fights when he looked like he was unstoppable lol jajajajaja
Canelo stays king!! Face of Boxing P4P best in the game!!! Plant has earned new fans as of today great performance much better than I expected!! Hats off to both these warriors!!
Got that A..whipped. Good never like plant.
POUND FOR POUND THE BEST!! 🔥💪🏼
Mexican power!!!!!
Thts a WRAP
🇲🇽👑🤣👍👍 👎👎🇺🇸
MY RAZA IS A KILLER IN THE RING!!!! BETTER ASK SOMEBODY!!!!
Canelo Needs To Fight Beterbiev or Bivol to Prove He's The Real Deal
Bravo yo te felisito por tu disiplina porce sino fuera poreso tu no estuvieras donde estas y eso es para aplaudirte tú dedicación al deportes ce tu escojistes y ce le as dado tu y ce deve ser duro al yevar una disiplina sin ex sesos es de a plaudir te felisito y no escuches la jente mal  intensionada ce te critice porce la jente ce te critica no tiene y nisave lo cees aser lo tu as logrado té ciero es un orgullo mexicano y al ce que le arda ce le arda pero tu eres un canpeon con todas. Las de la ley té ciero y ce sigan tus existotos sige padelante teciero soy tu fan
When u don’t know how to spoke 😂” Commentators”
Thank u said it all alone u can't fxxk with canelo fu
Steroid boy🙄
" Big deal, he's still ducking Michael Myers and Seal Team Six "
Le pusieron sus  "chinguassoss " 😆 🤣 😂 queria chingasos
Canelo “Dont talk about my momma again” Alvarez🔥🔥
Julio ya está mayor pero ninguno de nosotros que comentamos acá podemos enfrentarlo a los madrasos, por que es cuestión de 5 segundos nos nokea un
0:26 He started running😂
The GOAT
Dam I wanted plant to win smh , he did good tho , he jus needed guard himself better , its those later rounds man , that's wat proves good from great boxers
He's ready for fury
BEST POUND FOR POUND FIGHTER
Fuck boxing more people tuned in for ufc 268
Canelo my cousin he said he is gonna retire. You heard it first
Debido a esfuerzos, constancias, dedicación y amor al deporte ,canelo a demostrado quien es el y enseñanza para muchos. Dedicación y perseverancia y esfuerzo para todos , bendiciones 🤗
Looks like plant got paid to fall
I'm not a Canelo fan, but he's proven to be one of the greatest fighters ever ... period! As far as Caleb's concerned, where does he go from here? He's never going to be the champion at 168 as long as Canelo is there, and I don't believe he can be competitive at 175 lbs with Beterbiev and Bivol. He simply does not have the power to stave off the pressure those fighters would bring.  If he chooses to campaign at 160 lbs, he risks sacrificing power and muscle strength.  Canelo can only lose belts because of politics (failing to face a mandatory challenger, weight issues, etc.).  Caleb has serious decisions to make concerning his boxing future.
Dang. Crazy to know that he's Mexico's first undisputed champ. So many great Mexican fighters.
Las peleas de julio César Chávez eran. Muerte, lo daba todo en el ring imajinate ahora que está mayor se calento el amistoso
Since mayweathers last real fight canelo is way ahead of everyone by miles
Con costales quien no Se luce
He can still finish that fight.referee is a canelo fan obviously
Nighty night 🪴
It does just go to show how crazy good Floyd was. He just sucked all the talent out of Canelo. People say he was a rookie then but he was 42-0! That’s not a rookie.
Now Caleb knows….. it’s different on this level 🤣
Look at the wife is so happy about those dollars
Where these bum ass Trash plant fans at
Badass. Plant eph'd off. So glad Canelo isnt all talk like Plant is/was.
Plant looked like a sparring partner for a pro....
Bro strategy, power and straight dedicated to keeping his opponents tired and breaking them canelo is the muti champ for a reason I knew plant was nothing
No shocking ending tonight was canelo
Canelo is undefeated
Give him Arthur berterbier
But he wana fight lol
We all knew that Canelo would also win vivaa México 🥊💪🤠🥃🇲🇽 And plant was afraid, he looked on his face that he was about to lose
He is on top of the world. No doubt
Not bad for a white boy.  Congratulations Canelo!
yeah, who did caleb fight b4 canelo?  yup, NOBODY!  GGG vs canelo 3 still needs to happen.  The only fighter that gave Canelo any troubles in the past 5 years was GGG.  If Canelo knocks out GGG in their trilogy, I'll hop on Canelo's bandwagon.
Canelo is the GOAT
I'm a Canelo fan, and I'm glad he won.  But, man, I can do without the crown and all that jazz.
why these dam professional fighters don't learn to grab when you are dazzled you cant throw effective punches back run or grab on for dear life wtf
Legend goes Plant found his glasses right there on the floor.
bro came for plant and that belt like how thanos came for the vision for that last stone
I think I'm the only guy that can knock canelo out 😅😂
Canelo is the greatest it’s not up for discussion.
Didn’t it seem kinda weird of a knock out lol I’ll lose for 10mil .. what’s the lowest you’ll take to get knock by Canelo ?? Lmao
Canelos left hook was so good he made Plant do the windows power down 👀  All in all, Plant stood his ground and it was a great fight but he was fighting against an all time Great.
When you been at the bar all night and your frien asks you do you want to continue and you say yeahhh..10 seconds later sometimes you fall lol
Andre Ward's game plan worked to a Tee 👍
Real Mexican Style Saul CANELO Alvarez ... Now that's Boxing... All Mayweather does is Run.👌😁🇲🇽
Canelo vs Benevidez!!
Better than Mayweather all day
It’s canelos world & we’re just living in it 🇲🇽🐐
Dang my boy is filled with belts. Hard work baby
All jokes aside.....is there any reason for him to even stay at this weight? He hasn't just won he has outright dominated every opponent. He clearly needs to move up cuz these guys need a break from him.
joe frazier left hook
Coronation?  this is bad comedy
He refuses to fight the Charlo Twins only WBC hype jobs 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
It’s funny seeing on the comments about plant winning.. if you been watching boxing for a while you would of know.. no chance!
Caleb has A poker face I didn't think he was that hurt!! Dayumm
🐐
He walked like an old man when he went over to finish him off😂😂
That's what happened when anyone talk to much shit to Canelo they will knock the fuc out lol
What song starts to play at 1:08
Not even surprised canelo won lol
This was ass who in their right mind asked for this bullshit ass fight you all knew who was going to win this nice job on the mexicans team for superb cherry picking and doging and pushing blowing up garbage fights
Canelo definitely had flashbacks when he fought maywheather seeing that guard from cp what an amazing fight
Respect  to caleb he fought like  a true champion.
Plant basically fight the same way Billie Joe fought they are both similar fighters. Canelo too much for a guy like that
El ray de Mexico💯
TMT/TBE taught Canelo a good lesson... Good Job Canelo...👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Im Canelo supporter, fan ,whatever you want to call it, but I now admire Plant. Even though he lost the fight, he has my respect and from a lot of Mexicans as well.
Canelo is a much more interesting champion than weather that’s for sure whether canelo lost to him it doesn’t matter I’m pretty sure may wishes to be canelo right now all weather will have is just his record but never in his mind will he say damn I’m really a real fucken badass that goes out there and dominated mfs left to right I destroy them and knock the shit out of them how canelo does he can’t say that never will say that and never will get to say that pretty much all he can say is yea I ran in quite of few of my fights my money helped out on some amd yes I have a bit of slickness but I ain’t no threat that’s a damn for sure all I can pretty much do is just jab and move out but never finish my opponent like Tyson and canelo GGG list could go on with a million more fighters
Thais fight was so lame there’s no real boxing any more
I really wanted the ref to count when Caleb was down. He didn’t really give him a chance, he was standing up quickly. Why?
Hats off to Caleb. Gongrats to the new undisputed champion Canelo!
Cuando julio César peleaba y he visto sus peleas acá en YouTube wow daba todo golpe por golpe y si le pegaban iba más para dentro
The  Mexican king  Boxer  Legend
Tapped that white boi ass 🤣
King canelo rules supreme viva mexico mi pride my blood my love
Most ezz money I ever made! Ezzz 50k!!
Only a true “boxer puncher” can beat canelo when I mean beat I mean by KO too. Plant can slip all he want put has no respectable power and canelo will walk u down if u have no power. type style of boxers I can see beating canelo are Roy jones jr and James toney but guys like that are rare and that style of boxing is extinct in this modern era of boxing.
Plant good but he simply fought canelo to early he wasn’t ready
Nobody beats canelo right now
He just got Planted 😂
Caleb No Mas Plant 😭
Canelo is the best of his generation, hands down 💯
Undisputed Steroids champion of the World!
Canelo vs Jake Paul my Ass. Canelo would effing murder that dude! Truth
Canelo reminds me a lot of Messi
Fake
What a fucken legend !!!
Lo que plant intento hacer una estatrejia como la de Floyd Mayweather pager 2 o 3 necesita y luego moverte Floyd el más grande boxeador hoy por defensa ojalá salga otro julio César Chávez para demostrarles cómo es el boxeo
🇲🇽
Love all you new Canelo fan
Zombies bs plant
VIVA MEXICO!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽💚🤍❤
King Canelo👑🥊Congratulations Champ🥳Great Fighter!
Already know, experience plus heart equals a legacy.
Long live the King
The thing with Canelo is that he breaks his opponents up. Little by little . Once they are tired you can see him dominating . If a boxer can have great stamina and not get get hit by a power punch 2nd half of the fight then he has a chance to upset Canelo
Why the fuck did we ever doubt him
plant had a good game plan but he didn't have the offensive output /power to make Canelo respect him. Canelo walked him down the whole fight and then eventually Canelo landed that one punch he needed to put Caleb down.
Pfff vicious uppercut?? Lol that was disappointing
Alvarez isn’t fighting weaklings. He fights champs
Plant fought scared all fight after all the talking e did. He’s embarrassing. Sit down child
Where is all the canelo haters at?????
Where my Canelo haters ??? Time for y'all to bark !
A good fight canelo is a beast also what is the song they play
Rey de Reyes sin lugar a dudas
Damn makes u think Just how good was Mayweather.  Canelo learned alot from that loss. Felicitaciones Canelo
Canelo could have broken this guy’s arm too, but he decided not to and focused on breaking him slowly. Caleb’s mobility is amazing, but he was afraid to punch. Caleb knew this was a survival type of fight, and he had to stick with the plan(don’t get knocked out). In the end experience always wins. Great fight, but I still liked Canelo’s last two fights more than this one.
Canelo you are the man
Canelo its the goat 🐐 😎👌 Viva Mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
Caleb felt that power and didn't want to fight anymore #AllHailCanelo
Plant was canelo toughest fight
DAAAAAAAAAAAANG! That hook was a battering ram!
💪🏽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 I told y’all plant was gonna get educated
Canelo is starting to creep into the Goat conversation.
Canelo fanboys in this comment section as if canelo slept him with a left hook the way he slept kovalev with a right cross. He clipped caleb on the temple and wobbled him slightly because caleb didnt have his glove up all the way
otra pelea con otro taquero, otro desconocido,otro robo,Otro engaño . Miren la pelea contra mayweather !!!
That left hook was key against the Philly shell....The king once again showing his might....
oh but plant lasted 11 rds ... hahahaha ... he got torn apart for 11 rds ...
Felicitaciones Campeon,Leyenda Viva y Exelente Ejemplo para todos,Al Dedicarse a trabajar duro y con disciplina,Si de puede!!!To Mr Plant and you are a Champion and a Warrior,I tip my cap to you Sir, Thank you both for a great Fight!!!
Tyson is in the background...probably higher than anyone in the arena...knew it was time. He predicted a knockout
Good fight from plant didnt think he would make It to round 11
How many times did Floyd unify….. I’ll wait
crazy what steroids can do xD
F plant !!!!!!!
Ggg next
Mayweather would still kick his ass at 45.
Money talks 🪴 sold out what a pussycat
I KNEW HED WIN
Qué bonito se siente cuando le callas la boca a un hablador  y un fantoche que te da miradas matadoras y se siente intocable
When plant beat glass joe and the 1st 4 fighters in mike Tysons punch out, then decided to enter the code to fight mike tyson.
And white ppl be saying they're the superior race. Smd
He beat the dog shit outta plant 🤣🤣🤣
GGG got robbed, Canelo the fake champ!
We all knew this would happen
Big mouth Plant said there was going to be chingasos….That’s what he got and deserved…ftp
*99.9%* of comments-You Canelo haters. *0.001* literally no one else talking crap. Canelo is a beast bro everyone knows that.
Canelo said he got something special for caleb and caleno delivered!!!
At this point I think the only fight left that makes sense for Canelo is fighting Godzilla
Andy Ruiz lower right at 2:02 looking proud
Canelo has not fought nobody since Floyd he keeps fighting these hand picked bums with no power experience or ring skills..
Can imagine if that left hand didnt miss
It happens when u try to put down that Mexican race canelo all day number 1 who's next for this beast and good luck
Canelo is the truth.
VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽
Still couldn’t beat Floyd though. ☕️ 🐸
Don't test a Mexican in the street
Classic peek-a-boo. Lookin like Tyson in his prime. Gotta duck that hook and circle out like Mayweather after your jab gets slipped.
La humildad se demuestra como todos los mexicanos la demostramos......pero nadamas nos hacen encabronar y nos vale madre sea quien sea........VIVA MEXICO OTRA VEZ.........GRACIAS CANELO
Plant is a bum and showed it up to the fight and before the fight. Bye bye plant
On to Benavidez. If canelo ducks him then he's a nobody
But no one can beat mayweather sooooo im out !
Lo dicho lo más indigno que se puede ver ,el canela le ponen una palomita y todavía  lo alagan. El mexicano da verguenza.. Pónganse a un buen boxeador.
Another cherry pick by canelo, an opponent that has no power an posses no threat with his pitter patter boxing. Plant floats like a butterfly and that's pretty much it.
White boy cant jump lol
Como q se miro muy desesperado y callejero corriendo tras de el para noquearlo pienso q lo pudo haber noqueado  con stilo y en un manera  mas spectacular 🤔
Dude turned his head and got dropped. Good hit.
This dude will never be the same fighter after that ass whipping.
DAMN PBC IS LOOKING BAD HERE LATELY  WILDER GOT   KNOCK OUT IN THE 11TH ROUND. NOW PLANT GETTING KNOCK OUT IN THE 11TH ROUND 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Canelo fan to the fullest, but I must admit, the slick quick footed boxers definitely give my champ problems.
Cocjoy para que selequite de ablador el wey
Pound for Pound... Saul CANELO Alvarez #1.😁👌🇲🇽
Don't talk shit about my mom!!!
The Master 🇲🇽!!
Canelo ERA
I swear just before Andre ward decided to retire. He was the only one that stood a chance to beat Canelo
Shows how great Mayweather really is.
Jajaja buscabas la puerta 🚪
Yeet
Omg I almost cried 😭 when I saw him fall
😈🇲🇽🔥🇲🇽🔥
only mayweather took this dude to school. GOAT
Look Wat That Shiit Talkin Gtchu Boiii!!  #VivaLaMEXICO!!
Now GGG is Next... his only nightmare.
Por ocicon
Canelo haters be like. He’s still ducking The Hulk, Superman and Goku
Canelo aka thanos😎
Payday, payday, all you want is payday!!!
Mayweather sleeps he ain't ready.🐓
DAMMMMMM
why nobody talking about the elephant in the room ( DAVID BENAVIDEZ)????
Bring Mayweather out of retirement, give him his L.
Canella got lucky fighting paper champions.. well done.
STRETCHED OUT LIKE A CADDILLAC. RAZA PRIDE.
Look like the second ounch that landed is what really hurt him on the way down
That beard is a curse...rip caleb..rip josue
.......... WoW!  #NUFFSAID
Y’all feel the need for canelo to validate himself to y’all 😂😂 he’s the P4P King for a reason and not them, y’all can say whatever y’all want but he’s the one holding all 4 belts now. Put some RESPECT on his name!
What are the fanboys excuse now. Was it a cherry pick.
“and still… KING” Caleb wanted to run, Canelo said “nope, get your ass over here”  Great fight
Canelo is a problem 💪🏻🥊👑🔥😎 good TKO victory for him
Mexican power let’s go cánelo yes we did viva Mexico camiones bendiciones cuídense ánimo amén 🙏
Canelo the king Viva Mexico cabrones!!!!
Arriba mexico
Who didnt see this coming. At the face to face when plant missed we saw what was coming. The question is when is Canelo gonna fight someone worth a damn again?
Well..... He's done it!.. Anyone else wanna try?...
Real boxing fans knew what was gonna happen, now watch he announce he coming down instead of fighting benavidez
Hats of to Canelo, but this adds to the legend of GGG as well. Arguably beat the P4P #1 fighter twice (definitely in the first fight at least). It's a shame that they can't run it back for a 3rd time - Galovkin is 39 and has slowed down considerably, while Canelo continues to peak.   Strong praise for Caleb as well - he is young and will be champion again one day. Great show all around.
Goodwin for the steroids
Boring ass fight  this is not boxing any more is all about the money  canelo sucks and boxing too .
Canelo es la bestia!
But losing to canelo is like when canelo lost to Mayweather it's not really a loss! It's canelo! Well deserved
No one can’t beat canelo even tho I don’t like him I I give him respect ✊
HIS WHOLE CAMP ON ROIDSSSSSSS
Shoutout to Showtime they show the Knockouts after the fight unlike UFC who only show you pictures after the fact
David Benavidez is the man
🇲🇽 🇲🇽 UNDISPUTED!
Canelo still sends Adelaide Byrd a Christmas card
I wanted Plant to lose in a bad way, but he did better than I thought. Made for a pretty edge of your seat kind of fight 👍
Cherry 🍒 picking at its finest
Mexican don't mess around hhhaaahhaa Caleb Punk
So sad that people that don't know ishh about boxing get caught up in this fake circus. Noting but bussines and a weak a** sparing match to get paid. not going to fool me.
Canelo humbled him
Did I just read somebody say Canelo was ducking Jake Paul ?
canelo had a tough fight i honestly thought it wouldn’t go past the 5/6 round. s/o to both for a great boxing match
King thanos
Canelo Alvarez is better than Floyd Mayweather career wise when it’s all said and done.💯👍🏻
By the fith round plant slowed down tremendously he would start the round with jabs looking like he had the juice but by mid round canelo walked him down and plant literally planted ,🌱
Canelo vs tank .(both now in their prime)that would be a fight of the century and a fight I’ll pay to see
Im a canelo fan but damm Caleb plant was a really good fighter
Way too sexy
WOW!!!
TF YOU MEAN
Canelo be eating that tainted beef
One White Man beating another white man
As a MMA fighter I have to wonder I don't think we could handle these hands lol
I lost $400. I bet on canelo winning round 7-9. I’m honestly impressed plant was able to last that long. Didn’t expect it. I knew canelo would win by KO
The only person that can ever beat him, is Floyd, no one else will
The Mexican Power
Usman won tonight and now Canelo gets the KO. Mojahed will have his damn hands full for the next couple days.
Plant will go on and be great but rn it’s Canelos era
Y mi apuesta fue en el round 11 canelo sale con todo y solo necesito de unos segundos 😁😁
Plant to be brutally honest like chapelle says lol never had a chance Canelo is just a ultra instinct legend 🔥🐉 Jalisco let’s go!
My RESPECT to PLANT HE BOXED CANELO GOOD ! BUT CANELO IS IN    ANOTHER LEVEL ! LESS SAY IT LIKE IT IS !! NO ONE BEATS HIM AT HIS PRIME ! HIS BEAST !
Now fight the Charlo Brothers and andrade
He's fighting like Tank now 🤣
As a canelo fan congrats but ref should’ve stopped this after the first lunch canelo connected with him when plant got up plant was not right in the head it’s sad ref did a bad job here
Floyd  Mayweather  will not fight  canelo  if he was offered a100 million this time
Steroids cheater. He don't want a rematch. Let plant take roids and see what happens...lol
What's the name of that song playing at 1:18?
Hasta se lo acomodaba para meterle su verguisa como que le desia esperate papi que todavía te falta …😂😂😂
Oh gawd...not like this Caleb....
Paid to lose brro
How good is Floyd Mayweather
Plant todo el tiempo se cuido y puso su guardia para ese golpe, pero no sabía que canelo podía tirar ese golpe con más potencia canelo apretó en el round 11 con todo y no le aguanto
The Caleb Plant Fans are quiet in the comment section where y’all at? 💯😂🤣
🙏🏾✌🏾🐜Good Fight, Rematch Please✌🏾🙏🏾🐜God Bless Family🙏🏾✌🏾🐜Respect
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nOKCfbKQGKLAdH7eZQz2FKqhW8wN4eFK0
when you fight canelo: welp might as well accept my fate of hell.🙂
THE KING 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Canelo running after Plant like he was following him to the Travis Scott Astroworld festival.
Canelo wants no smoke from Andrade. Facts...  been ducking him for years now. Could have been undisputed at 160 but too scared cause we all know how it will end.💯
Look like he was struggling with the movent of caleb but maan his power is bull like till the very end wow... this guy is destined has 2 be
💪💪💪💪💪 CANELO Felicidades 👏👏👏👏
I know CANELO was ganna win , yo sabia QUE CANELO iva a ganar.
He’s the best right now. But is crazy to think that whoever fights canelo and win is going to be so rich just for one fight
That’s fake as fuck
plant has soft hands
Canelo picks bums that he knows are easy pickings... Why is Canelo running from the Charlo brothers, Demetrius Andrade and other top dogs.. We all new Plant wasn't going to win.. No surprises here
Told yall. Its not how u start but how u finish but respect to plant he will be even better after this
Plant is a great fighter definitely earned my respects. The dude has a lot of potential and can give any other boxer a great fight, but tonight was Canelo’s Night!!! VIVA MEXICO CABRONESSSS!!!!
I like canelo but I wish people would leave the Mayweather stuff alone as good as canelo is he will never be better or beat Mayweather it's over wish people would leave it alone
so glad he shut sweet pants plant up!!
Canelos little  steps tho at the end😂
GGG WIN NEXT
Canelo is the king! One more time he proved,  but for the haters is not enough. But we don't care CANELO ALVAREZ p4p the best.
I'm surprised anyone can hang to the 11th round 👍🏾
Still lost to Floyd mayweather
You have to give credit to Plant, he got up after that first brutal knockdown, albeit somewhat wobbly. After that he never threw another punch. And then he got up after the second knockdown. But he was no longer able to effectively  defend himself. The referee made the right call  lest he suffer the same fate as Saunders. But that Canelo, he is going down in history as one of the greatest boxers of all time.
Well...Caleb Plant is no Gennadiy Golovkin is he? ? ?
CLENELO Alveroids 💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💩💩💩💩🍒🍒
Por que no le hace el conteo? Si aún podía levantarse no le dio tan contundentemente como para que no siguiera! Se vio muy fake al final donde no lo conecta tan bien y “termina derrumbándose” 😏 Pareciera que solo estaba esperando que lo golpeara para dejarse caer… pamplinas! Sino habría salido con con un cabeceo o abrazándolo para ganar aire… pero en fin que siga el circo!
Canelo planted him
Canelo broke him piece by piece every round. Plant shoulder roll was working but the he moved away from it. At the end we knew kingnelo would win. Viva Mexico Cabrones.
i said before the fight, the question is how many Alvarez blows can Plant take. Now we know. And Caleb lied, he said we would hear that he was the undisputed...
Magikarp was evolving but Master denied it 👑
Plant wass traing to Run out the Ring
Bro started jogging after getting knocked down 🤣
$10 million for getting your ass whomped!   Not bad !
PEDS at their best someone needs to stop him
This was a great fight, my respect for caleb he really did do his homework and didnt give canelo a easy fight, used some of the same defensive techniques like mayweather and had canelo looking frustrated. But it just takes that one slip up that you cant afford to have with canelo and its game over
Good stoppage...it was obvious plant was not going to survive the rest of the round..
Couldn’t do it to Floyd.
Plant has taken other nasty shot worst than that & this one took him down smh
how many people actually believed that caleb was gonna win lol
That’s the result of messing with his mom.
If you piss of Canelo he won’t knock you out he will slowly wear you down a torture you for 12 rounds.
Viva Jalisco
He really was a plant
Arriba pinche canelo, Arriba mexico cabrones
Man Canelo going up in weight and getting stronger and doesn't get tired no more against bigger guys.  Most people go up in weight and have the opposite happen.  Never knew gaining weight fighting bigger guys is suppose happen that way.
Respect to Caleb plant for stepping into that ring but we all knew was going to happen and now for all you people that been saying he was ducking this guy that guy guy they're all up next trust me they're all up next
Canelo is at his prime right now. Hats off to Caleb, that guy brought it, came in shape. He was a hell of a champion, and I’m sure he will be again. Viva Mexico Cabrones.
As a guy who boxed Golden Gloves in H.S. and some AAU in College I can tell you that last body shot hurt!!!
Canelo ain't sleeping Tonight....watching his finishing on repeat...Glad the ref let it Continue
Man tonight was fun and full of amazing fights
Congrats champ!
Just like I said. Plant wasn’t ready for the mule kick. I had been saying this all along.
Canelo will never beat top undefeated black fighter.. out here beating up Europeans and white Boys all day.
Referee: "Do you want to fight?" Caleb Plant: "Yea" Then Plant proceeds to not fight, but be a punching bag. Lol.
I would love to see Canelo and Floyd go at it again..
Boy I miss GGG, back when he couldn't phase that chin.......laughed at those same shots
All Hail King Canelo
Lo mismo de siempre otra pelea mediocre y arreglada ni modo es lo qué hay donde quedo el verdadero boxeo de darse con todo desde el primer round como terrible morales y tapia o un verdadero guerrero Julio César Chávez
Looks like Plant found out 2 late
0:21 That instinct Canelo Gad is deadly
The right hook to the body became too much to handle. Caleb Plant had to change his defensive stance which opened the door for the left hook. Beautiful work by King Canelo.
He needs some milk....
Canelo is another breed of Mexican 😳🔥
Undisputed a Dogg!!!
Every fight like this shows you just how great MAYWEATHER was! At almost 37 years old Canelo couldn’t touch him.
Lol jake paul an his clown brother need a few of those to shut them up
I knew Canelo was ganna win
Telo mereces
Didn’t even last to the 12 and was talking all that shit.SMH
I hate how the commentator (don’t know his name) said that Canelo is fighting worse than he did against Calum. They always try to discredit him at any given moment
I knew canelo was going to win, plant doesn't hit hard enough.
Canelo is a legendary
Prime Canelo still got schooled by an old washed up Floyd Mayweather
2:08 is that Andy Ruiz bottom right ?😂😂
These guys are too white to beat this guy...not strong enough not enough power not enough black...just you watch a black fighter will beat canelo I like young charlo or spence
Felicidades Campeón CUBA está contigo
That run tho from canelo 💀
I watched It live Canelo was setting It up all night and tried to do It a few times Caleb was just jabbing and Canelo followed up on It I thought It would end In the 9th but fair play to both of them Plant did a lot better then I thought.
The champ is hereeeee baby !!
Pay day
All due respect to Saul, but Caleb is a bona-fide scrub.
Caleb just not liked. He talks too much and his confidence was never real
157 people mad
I put up a great defense. I stop his punches with my face.
This guy hits way too hard. No one man should have that much power haha
Steroids
Mayweather vs Canelo ..part 2🤔
I already knew Canalo was gonna beat him fight one of those charlos a real tough fight a dog one of those blk fighters.
Canelo make me proud to be Latin 😎😎
I love this
Puras tortas para sacar dinero 💰.
It’s not giving what it’s supposed to give 🤷🏾‍♂️ He ran from too many good fighters to get here but congrats 🎊
THIS MAN IS TOO FUCKING GOOD MAN, EASYYYYYY FUCKING WORKKKK BABYYYY. LETS GO CANELO
Great boxer on steroids beats a bum. What a shocker.
He forgot to hold hold PEDelo till he recovered.
It was the left hook not the uppercut.
Jake Paul is coming for that crown.
I think he might just be the goat and I’m filipino
Boys got more belts that JC Penny
I thought plant was built different and it was supposed to be his destiny, he didn't show anything on the ring didn't land anything sucker
Plant gave it his all,mad respect for that man. But he had it coming.
cameraman shoulda zoomed in on oscar to see his reaction
Evil is going to get knocked out for worse than what Can elo did to a good man and fighter!
Plant looked like he was running to his mommy after he got up from that first knockdown 😂🤣
Canelos eyes, Lock's like El Diablo 😈😈
That punch didnt even completely connect, props to plant. He lasted a while, but canelo oo man.
Canelo the Mexican legend Mike Tyson!!!
Jake Paul been real quiet ever since Canelo won 👀
Canelo still thinking about when Caleb called  him a mthrfkr ,made him pay for it
Reminiscent of the Saunders stoppage with that uppercut.
Wish I could of bet on this fight
Billete mata carita
Canelo is going to destroy the rest of the lights heavyweight like the rest. He's also going to unify lights heavyweight. No doubt about it
haters still taking shit no matter what canelo does  "nah he ducking thanos, Goku and Superman"
For everyone out there without hating Caleb was doing better in boxing but like all they can't hang with the canelos blows but Caleb deserves real respect
Canelo winning this fight only means he is finally ready for jake paul  lol jk 🤡😂
Canelo out here being like thanos
Puro costalito. Para entrenar
Ummm why did the ref call the fight as plant was getting up? What??
I knew it! I knew Canelo would take it via stoppage in the later rounds!
Plant embarrassed himself and his whole family. All that shit talking just to get his ass beat. Lol I hope this taught him to just keep his mouth shut.
2:28 Plant hesitated he could have tried to turn it around, he had already given up.
Canelo chasing after him like mom would chase after me with the chancla"No mi corras cabron"
Canelo is in his prime
Don Vaughn I know you’re lurking 😂  What happened to Caleb?
What a garbage fight just shows how trash the division really is
Bet he won’t fight Ariana grande
Respect for plant 🌱 showed a lot of heart in there
#Mhonividente lo predijo México estará alegré
What a tremendous waist of everyone's time
The disrespect on Canelo’s name before this fight is crazy once again proving MFs wrong
What are the names of the two songs played at the end of this video? They sound good.
CANELO IS OUR HERO!!! 😊😊😊
Viva el ray caselo Alvarez viva la Raza cabrones
The real life YUJIRO HANMA!!!😎
Canelo know that he can’t beat  Carlo
Caleb fought a good fight, but it was only a matter of time. Congrats to Canelo Can't wait to see who he fights next
White boys burn out fast no stamina in there DNA fight was not exciting canelo was off he was not precise tonight he waited for the late rounds to take advantage of the fact we all know white boys no matter how rough they grew up just don't have the stamina next up charlo or beviendas
The ref just wanted to see Plant get hurt lol. Should have stopped it after the first knock down. He was still wobbly once he got up never fully recovered
Floyd is the best defensive..canelo might be the best offense.
Wow
PURO CANELO CABRONES VIVA MEXICO CHINGADO EL ORGULLO JALICIENSE
Good performance by Canelo but Mayweather easily makes him his son even today if they fought. Canelo's aggressive style will be nothing compared to Mayweather's speed accuracy time and defense.
no deberia hablar de su madre
Canelo after the fist knock down looked like a mean pit-bull, just waiting for the leash to get broken
Anybody who says Canelo isn’t #1 p4p is a fool.
Nobody touching this vato🇲🇽
Referee:  “do you wanna fight”  Caleb: “Yeah!!” Canelo: proceeds to destroy him
Canelo: You’re not on my level
Canelo haterz: He’s still scared to fight Fury, Wilder, Jake Paul, Nate robinson, AJ
Wait, he's with Showtime now? Ok 😎
#4:00  #🇲🇽  #💪  #🏆  #👑 #👍
Well he was the favourite and he proved it. Canelo is just on a different level, unstoppable
Still ducking Charlos, Benevidez, Bivol, and Andrade. I think he’ll beat Andrade though but for some reason he won’t fight him
Hail to the King. Good fight..
Canelo broke him down and knew when to go in for the finish! Great fight champ!!! 🥊
And Mayweather schooled this guy
Beautiful fight, great sportsmanship. Respect to Caleb for going until he couldn’t go anymore.
Men that crowd is one of a kind
SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE PLANT SOME MILKKKKK
executed
He got F up! Yeah try to dodge that! Move move and still got F up! 😂
Simplemente lo mejor👉 México
And now GGG can take all the belts
Undisputed. That's not too hard a task when you don't have to go through any blacks to accomplish it.
Respect for plant 🇲🇽
Nobody will ever beat Canelo again
Floyd shitting in his pants.
Canelo!!! Good sportsmanship from Canelo and Plants team wish Plant the best
Canelo really said "where my money at?!?!?!"
Reason why canelo couldnt finish the fight earlier was because plant kept on holding on to canelos left arm
I knew it
Canelo is just unstoppable!!!  My goodness, canelo can end a boxer career!!
Im not a boxing fan but lets be honest. Hes on roids.
Man…I really thought Caleb Plant was eating all those shots well….Apparently they were hurting him but he wasn’t showing it at all.  Props to Caleb Plant but Canelo is the KING!!!
Damn!
I was impressed with Plant, actually. He fought well and stood his ground. He didn't fight like a chump, which, of course, makes Canelo's victory that more amazing. Hats off to them both.
Where are the hatters at and he fight 4 or times a year not like other some boxers only one every 2 years
Fight Kamaru Usman.
Plant gave Alvarez a difficult fight. With his stance and style. Holding the glove and  pulling canelo in where he couldn't throw. I had the score cards even till the knockout
Don’t get me wrong I love the sport of boxing and I’m also a fan of canelo but is there anyone going to address the elephant in the room? And that is the very simply fact that he avoids elite black fighters. Hope I don’t come off as making it a race issue. It’s not me, it’s canelo. If he were standing in front of me I would also ask him this exact same question. In my opinion he is not undisputed when an old man like Floyd Money Mayweather put on a boxing clinic against canelo Alvarez. Literally swam with his ass out to deeper waters and drowned this undisputed elite black fighter dodger. At least Oscar delahoya had a set of stones on him and fought the best because in his mind he was the best. Salute Oscar Delahoya. But congratulations on a great win tonight Canelo.
Cinnamon is the truth!!!
Jake Paul really wants to fight Canelo 😭😭😭
"I have something special for you" - Canelo
lets be honest we all knew this was going to happen
Congrats to the mexicans
Canelo haters: he's on steroids or he lost to floyd...smdh
Never buying a boxing match again. The judges scorecards are killing the sport
Face of boxing went 11 with the guy who went 12 with truax lmao no Mamés bueno viva Mexico lol 😂 betervieb laughing confident
Plant has skill but his punches have no power behind them.
King Canelo
Canelo is in No big rush to fight any elite Black fighter...that why he's  fighting all those white fighters...
Canelo will always be a drug cheat, now can he finally fight some of this great black competition out here?
If only haters would learn... but, oh well. 🤷
Caleb did good its just canelo dont give a fuck man
Canelo be putting on belts like Mexican moms dressed us in the first day of winter.  You need 3 shirts, 2 sweaters and a jacket  No te me vallas a resfriar
I'm not a Mexican analyst but I am Mexican lol,  but looks like Canelo is still trying to prove every one wrong since ha was a little kid 😅, being called the white freckle kid his whole child hood , he's showing us , color of your skin has nothing to do with power and hearth,  work your ass off in the gym if you want to be great lol
Yes he can carry his power when he's taking steroids anything he does now let's see has full drug-testing means nothing there is a huge* by your name huge? With a syringe
ALLLL HAIL KING CANELO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #MEXICO SE LE RESPETA!!!
Face plant....
Anybody else here the ref tell Caleb "I'm not sure yet" or something to that effect. Wonder what that was about?
Time for benavidez to get canelo
Canelo coming late to the ring walk had me worried  haha. I bet heavy on the knock out late and I was worried this fight would go the distance but my boy came through!
I can’t hate anymore this man is pound for pound king hands down and is a great fighter
Thanks for this fight's highlight which shows the complete ending.  Showtime is the best.
On the Wider/Fury fight: made $7,500. Canelo/Plant: made another $7,500.  It pays to know boxing. 👉😎👈 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Let's be honest here we all knew Canelo was getting the W
Canelo can’t even hold all his belts 😂
Mike Tyson called it
Wheres the gayweather fans at hahaha
CHARLO, ain’t said sh*t!!!
what do y’all think he goes next? 175 would be crazy
Where was this during Mayweather? I'm fucking homeless now bro smh
Usman KO's Canelo in 3 rounds.. NI JAH!!!
RIGHT HE'S NOT THE BEST YET HE DON'T HAVE CHARLO BELT OR SPENCE AND CRAWFOD BELT YOU CRAZY
Canelo got the finish and I got paid from it but those judges were trash. Plant won rounds 1-5 maybe the first 6. He made everything except Canelo a right to the body a couple times look foolish. The announcers were terrible biased and didn’t acknowledge plant winning exchanges even in the slo motion replays 🤦🏽‍♂️
He is the one…
He beat a C class fighter congrats
Can't believe only Floyd had ever beaten this man.  Canelo is a monster.
Early stoppage. You let Fury get up.. let Plant get up. He was getting up.
I'm glad i didn't pay for this
Canelo lo mejor de lo mejor si viva jalisco mexico.
A Caleb Plant, water it twice a day. And since he's already on the ground, no flower pot or soil is necessary. All hail the pound for pound King Canelo Alverez!
Bro tried to run off that hit at 0:08 lmfao
Fraud
Im a Canelo hater because of the roids but at this point its like...
Why the fuck did the ref stop it immediately after the second knockdown instead of doing the 10 count?
Damn.canelo is just too fuckn much for these dudes.who is next.i think he needs to give GGG a trilogy.
Canelo haters be like but he hasn’t fought Heavy weight thought so he’s not great.
Plant did well but he just lacks a real strong punch. Could he develop it - perhaps.
And Jake Paul wants to fight Canelo 💀💀
WOW CANELO IS JUST A DIFFERENT MONSTER
If I was plant I would’ve apologize for calling him a motherfucker.🤷🏿‍♂️
People saying Plant only won 2-3 rounds are disrespectful as fuck.  Plant was up by 1 round after the 8th imo.  He was boxing well and neutralizing Canelo's offense.  then Canelo took over after the 8th.  But yeah you're just being delusional if you think Plant only won 2 rounds lmfao.
Where are all the plant fans what do you have to say now
Plant did pretty good. If he had some power with the counter punches then he probably would have had a better chance.
“In his head the words motherfucker echoed as he hit his opponent”
You can do anything with enough steroids lol😂😂😂
It’s save to say that Canelo is the greatest Latin boxer of all time. Brilliant defence, insane power, stone of a chin, intelligent and beautiful footwork. I’m not even Mexican. At least top 5 greatest of all time. You a hater if you disagree.
To think this man post Floyd and more recently after triple ggg 1 would become this good is insane
He gave Caleb mercy with that last shot.
The way canelo chased him down for the KO looked like a LION chasing his prey🔥🔥🔥
Awesome ☆☆☆☆
Not different when you that one L and 2 draws...........but hey go figure Mexican bandwagon fans
Ran that mouth...
Canelo is now tied with booker T.  5x , 5x, 5x , 5x, 5x champion then does the spin a runie
Hasta donde ha llegado esta cochinada de Box   Se terminó el buen boxeo que lastima 😏
Respect to Caleb but Canelo was just too much for him.
NOW PLZ SHUT CHARLO THE FUKKKK UP AND IM BLACK
Canelo Haters: He's on steroids Wilder: TILL THIS DAY
That's is Plant, finding out... He kept saying canelo was gonna find out, well tonight He found out...
Congratulations 🎊 canelo Alvarez 🇲🇽💪👊
My respect to Caleb Plant he fought a good fight. What a warrior, I thought it was gonna go the distance 👊
Viva mexico kabrones
At first I fucking hated Plant not going to lie but mannn he showed heart and he took that L like a Real Man!!! Canelo P4P King WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!
🇲🇽Yes sirrr 🇲🇽CANELO 🎉 VIVA MEXICO CABRONES
Canelo just went undisputed in 11 months. Just think about that
This shit is so fake it's gotten out of hand
I’m a Canelo fan BUT I won’t be all in until he stops ducking them Charlo Twins. He’s literally scared to even say there names.
hoyyy sht, Congrats and props to plant
Fight was nice! Glad canelo won though!! But damn, Caleb can eat some heavy shots. Mad respect for that guy, solid performance.
Was already legendary this just moves him up to the best in the world maybe of all time. This was such a great knockout. 🇲🇽🐐
In the last 30 months canelo’s beat Billy Joe Saunders, Caleb Plant, Danny Jacobs, Callum Smith, Sergey Kovalev. What a run
Closest thing to Mayweather v Canelo 2
GOAT DOING GOAT THINGS #CANELO
Pelea estúpida para GRANDES ESTUPIDECES INCREÍBLE HUMANIDAD HOY EN DÍA CUALQUIERA ES CAMPEON 😳 OMG 😴😴😴🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GOAT 🐐
Canelo be putting on belts like Neo strapping guns before rescuing Morpheus.  I need 2 of these and one of those
Everytime Plant threw punches he looked like he was just making sure he wasn’t behind the scorecards   Everytime that Canelo threw punches he looked he was trying to commit attempted murder
Ain't gonna lie this man plant had me nervous for canelo but for sure he did wayyy better than many expected him to.Canelo at this point is unbeatable,not even using the style meant to beat him.Closest thing to Mayweather v canelo 2.
If canelo is the best why he haven't fight El Chapulín Colorado?
Viva Mexico !!!!! Cabrones !!!!!
The best!!!!
I did predict that one of them would be standing and the other on his back. I did say it would be in the fourth round. It wasn't. Canelo deliberately took him into the late rounds.
Hard work & dedication pays off💪🏼
Mexicans owns the sport of boxing for sure.
Lesss goooo
Canelo SUCKS, he still ducking OBAMBA 😂
Lol Mayweather come back
The thumbnail 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
i really dont see anyone beating canelo right now hes gotten better each fight
Congrats thanelo!
Let's just be honest..Saul Alvarez is a very good fighter. But he's not a great fighter. Marvelous Marvin Hagler would undoubtedly knock Alvarez out...
I have no idea why the referee stopped the fight immediately without a count. Only down for the second time in the whole fight. 11th round. Plant has done well so far. Only a few more minutes to go until it goes to a decision. As soon as he calls it, Plant gets up as if to say, "why would you do that?"  Horrible decision. Let it go to the scorecard.
My only regret was that Canelo fought a Floyd Mayweather when Canelo wasn't at his peak. The fight would've been so different if they fought each other now.
Canelos Fighting a Bunch of Fighters that Cannot Punch🤔 I didnt even watch😉
Viva el Canelo te amooooo
Plant actually held his own there..it just wasn't enough against Mexican Thanos with 5 Infinity Gems with him 😅
The  sport: 🥊  The owner: 👱🏻‍♂️🇲🇽
Let's get it started #caneloassasin
Lets go cinnamon!
Que lindo le queda el color oro
Floyd did his thing with him 😵
Most people use 1 belt at a time   Canelo needs mas
“What ever he hits, he destroys”
Canelo IQ is over 9,000 setting that up via long game. He studied him. He hit body shots and arm shots. He hit his defense so strong that it made Plants defense slow down enough for Canelo to land that left.
Wowwww tenemos un Bello REY!!!
Chewed up grass plant!!
Caleb who ?
Let’s hear the negativity from Let go ma Eggo fake boxing news Ego?
The undisputed super middleweight champ! 👑canelo!! 🇲🇽
The canelo assassin hashtag yall
Canelo, most improved Boxer of our time. I didn't like him @ 1st, but can't deny that he's 1 of the best of our Generation!
For mexican La jefita or la mama never and ever
He still ducked Muhammed Ali in his prime tho.
Canelo vs Usman!!!!
He planted Plant on his ass 🤣💩👩‍🦼
Buen  show
It's a great thing to even witness this amazing warrior in his prime!
Canelo your my hero
respect for plant
Dude canelo already won from that first conference they had
Fun fact Floyd beat canelo
Whole fight plant was shaking his head saying the hits weren’t landed or doing damage lol clearly they broke his ass down
Welp who's next ....?????
Canelo's accuracy is a sight to behold. It's not easy splitting the guard and countering on a Philly shell defense, especially when your opponent is good at it. Caleb did better than I thought, he held his own, thought he would fold in the 9th. You can tell Canelo was conserving energy most of the fight the way he just shifted gears in the beginning of the 9th. I'll say this, Plant's body is gonna be hurting for weeks, he took some massive right hooks to the body all night.
KING OF BOXING 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👑👑👑👑
Canelo be putting on belts like stolen Valor people put on medals before they walk out their house.  I need 2 of these, one of these
At the moment Canelo is #1!!!!!🇲🇽
Seguro que si canelo 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
:)
Canelo is a beast!!
Still lost to Mayweather
He cherry picked and won 4 belts but he’s no champion in my opinion 🤷🏽‍♂️
Yheee
Canelo is a beast. Caleb gave a good showing and could have stole the fight, but he didn't have the power to keep Canelo from unleashing his onslaught. Great fight. I'd like to see Canelo fight Andrade next.
happy birthday eddy reynoso congratulations to Canelo the p4p king
Did y’all hear the punches Canelo was landing my surround sound was crazy every time Canelo was punching on the body
Mayweather still beat him. (People called Canelo the goat then) BUT MAYWEATHER STILL BEAT HIM ! Lol
Floyd mayweather  next
Caleb really thought he had Canelo all figured out in the first rounds and was honestly fighting very smart and doing well  (thinking he was winning rounds) you could really tell Caleb had studied Canelo just for Canelo to turn it all around (as predicted) and have Caleb all figured out. The man is just simply the best of the best 🇲🇽💪🏼
This guy doesn’t know Boxing, real boxers when hit will hold and tie up and kill the clock. Go back to the corner and get his wind back and go to the center of the ring and jab, box and hold. Tools in the chest bro  Shout out to the greats Bernard Hopkins, Andre Ward, James toney, Roy Jones, Mayweather. Those guys know how to box.
He needs to fight Charlos and Andrade to shut them tf up. Enough with all these unknown champs.
Que viva Mexico 🇲🇽 bravo 🙌🏼
Fixed
When caleb went against the ropes, after the first knock down, I hit the hulu button on my remote and missed the ending. Wtf.
Go Canelo Alvarez!!!, I knew He would beat this guy Caleb Plant!! 😊😊💪💪👍👍🤛🤛🤜🤜👊👊👊👊👍👍👍👍
PED Canelo
Lmfao so how much Did people, pay for the fight. when everyone knew who was going to Win. When I just Saw it for free right now.
Canelo Alvarez knocked that Bish out lol
KING CANELO RULES SUPREME!!! CHEERS TO ALL
Plant could have beat canelo, but he started fighting on the inside too much, and he abandoned his jab, stayed on the ropes too much,and didn't throw enough combinations, and gave canelo too much time to think
thank god for that pinche carne azada cabrones ... ariba mexico!
Canelo ran tours him like me when I’m trying to kill a fly that has been bugging me all week
Las Vegas, NV is in the USA last time I checked.  Yet, this crowd overwhelmingly cheered on this foreign fighter when he beat an American fighter.   American has changed and America is completely gone and finished.   Sad....
I was expecting this fight to be shorter, but I think Canelo had other plans, to make him suffer until he couldn't do it anymore, what an amazing performance by Canelo.
At 2:06 he did tank knockout but with the right hand
You can give respect to plant but his fans make you want to hate tf out of him.
Canelo only fights can drivers
Imagine how boxing would be if there was a guy in there respective divisions trying to unify it instead of holding on to dear life to one belt
Lol
"U are not on deez level"  "U will see something different"  "I PROMISE U"
Caleb actually did better than I expected great fighter
I hope to see more of Caleb after this. I knew Canelo was gonna win. But plant actually showed his worth going 11 rounds with the worlds best p4p. Not to mention his only loss is to Canelo. Not a bad resume.
Que mamadota!!!
Canelo collected all infinity stones, which one of us will disappear?
Like canelo said..there is levels to this game...and plant is just not there...fuk ya canelo making history...lets see shat the haters are going to say
Canelo did it again!!!!  🐐
Caleb plant was sold out classed he even looked like Canellos sparring partner and I was a big Caleb fan I just thought he would bring more than he did he sure to talk a fight I guess that selling tickets ……I don’t know what he’ll do now there’s no champions for the belts anymore only Canelo and he can be him…..Say good night Caleb
😎👍🇲🇽👍🥊👍
Canelo stay focus
Congrats to Canelo and his team it’s been a long road but I know in the end it was all worth it
I still think a prime Canelo Vs prime Floyd would've been better than prime Floyd vs prime Pacquiao🤷🏿‍♂️
Canelo haters?? How about all the Plant haters. You know, the haters who would still be asleep after Canelo hit you with that uppercut.
Pelea comprada! Que buen negocio es el boxeo!
If you know, southpaw going to make another video about canelo lol
FINISH HIM!   🤪 🥊 💨
Canelo getting championship belts like Thanos got the infinity stones…
Plant was suppose to get steamrolled but he bagged rounds. This proves to me Andre Ward would’ve beat Canelo, and makes me rethink the greatness of Mayweather
We seen this coming like we seen the vaccines 💉 coming! 😂
Legendary.
Canelo calendar verga
Canelo delivers KO every damn time 🔥… hell of a fight for Caleb Plant … worth every damn penny #congrats champ
THE AWESOMEST BOXER IN THE WORLD: KING CANELO!!! CHEERS

I ask where are Caleb s father's words about CANELO ? GONE WITH THE WIND :
I guess there really no one who can beat canelo 🤷‍♂️
Canelo is a BEAST!
The only way Canelo is going to get respect is if he can convince Mayweather to get back in the ring with him..
King Kanelo
Caleb is reali good faiter
early stoppage imo
Impresionante!
Where are y'all Caleb fans?  yeah 11 round y'all left
Can't wait to see jake paul KO canelo 🤣😂
Uppercut.  Looked like a hook
Nadamas porque andaba abriendo la mamadora de mas arriba el canelo viva México
Oooh Mrs Cinnamon Señora Canela Won
TERRIBLE STOPPAGE. TERRIBLE NON COUNT. EXTREMELY Frustrated with The ref waving that off so early after 2nd knockdown. I'm also frustrated with plant for backing up to the ropes so mucb trapping himself. He thought he was going to backup and pivot and turn canello into corner or ropes but canelo attacked the body and trapped the body every time caleb backed up to the ropes. Caleb plant needed to come forward more, and put canello on back foot. Absolutely cannot let canello get u against ropesm caleb should've avoided the ropes, done more jab and grab to defend his body. Caleb plant boxed way too much thinking he was going to turn canello around, but never quite could and he Gave away to many body shots trying to escape the ropes.  Alvarez is awesome. Awesome power, awesome performance, genius going to the body and trapping caleb plant with those wide body shots. Caleb plant shouldve adjusted in 8th round, and stopped moving backwards, and he didnt  Very angry with plant because he is way better than that.   He has to know with canello you are going to have to jab and grab and suffocate his offense and power, or come forward and overwhelm canello with volume. You cannot let him back you up like that. Caleb plant shouldve known better to move backward so much after getting eaten up with those body shots.    Bad stoppage though. Huge fight like this? That was a Terrible stoppage when plant was not THAT hurt. it was not like wilder who had been knocked down 4 times.   I'm sorry, that was a bad stoppage. That ref waved that off way too soon. He was not given a fair chance at a count  Canello still rules division but caleb plant deserved a count.  He was more tired than hurt, he got right up, that was terrible stoppage by ref. Way too fast, plant just got hurt for first time in that round, plant deserved a count. Canello didn't hurt plant until that 11th round  Good for canello, but ref didnt do well waving that off without a count. This is just as important as fury wilder, caleb deserved a count. It's not like he was so beaten and bloodied, he needed to be protected. Caleb plant looked as though he was quickly recovering from that 2nd knockdown and it was waved off  Terrible non count. Good ref but terrible non count. Plant was not done. Talk about going out on your shield, caleb plant didnt get opportunity to do that  Noone got hurt until this 11th round and caleb plant was not that hurt. Tired but not THAT HURT to get waved off   Hopefully canello fights benavidez or charlo next. Hopefully he has the courage to fight charlo or benavidez next after "knocking out" caleb plant.   That non count makes me so angry because plant is a great champ and he deserved better from the ref
Ref did a great job.
Hell yeah!!! B
TO all the plant lovers,He never had a chance.he was just hype,never fought any top ten fighter,as you can see he couldn't handle the power and was destroyed.
Arriba las Chivas güey!!!!
Charlo was there to see the show, next on line charlo I promise you guys
No 💉🚫🏆
Canelo is a brutal finisher man.. he just puts these guys out like they’re amateurs
Greatest  of All Time: Canelo 🇲🇽
LDBC is on suicide watch once again!!!
Plant was running 🤣🤣🤣
CAnelo should defend his 168 belts against Benavidez.. Then takeover 175lbs.. He will be the Goat if he does that
Who doing the chicken dance now caleb
🪴😴✌🏼
Have respect for canelo good job. But still don’t like how he tested positive for a suspended substance. I will never have full respect for people that have cheated
Spence would knock canelo out 👀
what was that song that played after he won
Undisputed World Champion Canelo Saul Alvarez... finally and congratulations Champ.
mayweather vs canelo 2 would be nice canelo would destroy mayweather now
All the haters said Canelo wouldn't land that uppercut 😂
Talking all that trash for what? Caleb is just what David Benavidez said, and I knew Canelo would stop him sooner or later.
Felicidades pero la verdad le salió respondon el  oponente sino se huviese descuidado esa pelea se hubiera ido a tarjetas y eso hubiese sido vergonzoso para canelo….el mismo dijo q se le estaba complicando….Plant vs charlo fuese una excelente pelea….ese chavo es un excelente boxeador…muy tecnico y acepto su derrota…..perooooo las peleas de canelo jamás serán como las de Márquez -morales-travieso-
No surprise here to be honest. I knew fully well that Plant was in great shape and would stick around due to it, but you're up against a different kind of beast, the greatest, the unbelievable Canelo Alvarez. I predicted a KO in the 6th--8ish rounds, but it went a bit longer. Congrats to the champ, Canelo!
Man props to Showtime for showing the knockout literally an hour after the fight for those who didn't watch the fight!
Plant shouldn’t of been in the ring with canelo.
Canelo was losing the fight when he caught Plant with that left hook. Those judges trash.
Simply the best boxer in this world.
Looking at Canelo now. It’s crazy to think how Mayweather dominated him.
Que chingon se siente ser Mexicano!!!
Nice canelo
Biggest i told you so ever
Wow Canelo 👏🥊🤜🥴supplanted that a$$ literally (all puns intended) ¿Hubo alguna duda? VIVA MEJICO CABRON 💪😁🥳🍾🥂🍻
Canelo is K.O.'ing fighters bigger than him, impressive
Caleb did give him a hard time no doubt , but canelos patience paid off! Great fight
HISTORY.
GGG BEAT HIM TWICE
i respect caleb so much... after the ref asked if he wanted to fight you can just see his face this guy is a warrior. I knew canelo would take the W but Caleb deff had good defense
Puros no batos le ponen al canelo y quiere otro pelada   y quiere al traviezo arce
Canelo plays around with these guys then knocks them out later rounds.
Viva mexico 🇲🇽 mother fuckers
"sweet hands" more like "sweet dreams"
Tough to beat a "JUICED UP " Canelo
Canelo needs that with bitchweather
Canelo is simply a different breed!!!  Solid performance from Caleb, didn’t back down & threw his shots
Caleb plant pelio muy bien fue todo un guerrero pelo mejor que los demas
& y'all haters keep on talking shit 😆😆
Where’s Floyd Mayweather’s fine ass at 😂😂😂
Sooner or later the Canelo power gets you.. you gave him everything you had Caleb good fight
Floyd still got his number👊🌵
Boxingego crying rn
Caleb was watching a lot of Floyd before this fight and tried to implement that shoulder roll and it was working defensively but he wasn’t countering anything and eventually slipped up with the shoulder roll and got caught
Witnessed greatness.. November 6th 2021
Canelo still ain’t shit nowhere near Chavez Sr  Fuckin won that Burger King crown  Hope Andre Ward or Benevidez finishes his career
One more punch and he would of went to sleep
Hail to the king
Anybody else thinking this translator about to get fired as fuck🤣🤣🤣🤣
i think Godzilla has something to said about canelo be coming king lmao
That run canelo did to finish plant off gives me extreme “Mirahijodelagranchingadaquechingaosestasllorandotedoyrazonparallorardeverdad” vibes
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Ariba Mexico 🇲🇽 🥊 Felicidades 🤴 Rey Canelo 🥊
History in the making dawg, can’t deny it!!
Bet more, your money is safe with me!
What’s the song at 1:08
No one talks about Canelos mom! 🤭
If Caleb didn't earn a little respect from even the biggest Canelo fan then you are straight up a hater
Canelo beat 3 undefeated champs who combined held a record of 78-0 within 11 months. Yet y’all favorite fighter gets in the ring once every 18 months against grocery store clerks.
Se Pasa. De Vergara si el canelo Bala verga
La pelea estaba arreglada
The way he ran after him 🤣
Fake knock out berly touched him
The ref deserves alotta credit here. Im glad he called it after the 2nd knockdown. Theres no point in letting a guy even try to continue a fight when he's that hurt. Congrats to Canelo this man just keeps improving. Great to see him fight 4 times in 1 year. Just goes to show how much promoters get in the way of fights. Wish he woulda dropped golden boy years ago. Great fight and credit to Plant any other fighter vs him that night and he easily wins by UD.
3:59 Why wasn't Teofimo's name mentioned .......interesting 🤔😂
Gran pelea por ambos guerreros, pero Canelo es esta imparable, y cada vez cerrandole el hocico a sus haters. Saludos a todos.🤗🤗
It only took Canelo 11 months to clear the 168 division 11months! Legend! 👏🏻👊🏻👏🏻🏆🤴🏻
Everyone literally saw this shit coming 😂
Shoulda stopped it after the first knock down.  Plant wasn’t right.  At the very least, the ref should have stepped in after Caleb fell against the ropes and clearly was unwilling to defend himself.
The little  leprechaun Fook
😆 😆 😆 i have no idea why caleb thought he was finna win. Love canelo red head self!!! We need another mayweather rematch!!!!
From Germany--Canelo Congrats--You Americans are awesome.
KING CANELO
Fight some real comp and stop paying theses guys to lose.
Well yeah.
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽 🔥👑🥊
Thought Caleb would've went down in rounds 5-10. He showed good defense and did better than i expected
Yo he need to beat goku before Mr. Hercule
Told yall.. its not how u start its how u fnish that matters
Plant couldn't handle all of that pressure. He did better than I thought he would while the fight lasted, I thought it was much closer than Showtime seemed to believe it was... But Canelo was brilliant.
Juiced up freak.
There’s levels to fighting. Plant is still a dangerous elite boxer- but canelo on an entire diff level
Let’s not forget Mayweather put Canelo through a boxing clinic.
Plant was trash!!! Canelo is in the perfect weight class to give the illusion of greatness.
Mexico 🇲🇽
Goodnight.  Foolish guy …
💉💉💉 love watching Mr Mexican meat
Canelo should not only be considered among the greatest boxers to come out of México, but one of the greatest boxers of all time and a future hall of famer. There hasn’t been a more dominant super middleweight with the same aura of invincibility since Roy Jones Jr.
Untouchable
Wow the music  🎶 sucks 😕
Let's see...  Canelo lost to GGG, Mayweather and soon to be Beterbiev. All others he dominated start to finish. #Facts
Plant was just surviving the whole fight . The philly shell was good enough to cover the body and make it hard for Canelo to land but he showed no offense . Also , Canelo seemed to be going 95% up until the 11th round when he decided to go 105%
He is number 3 after Mayweather and Pacquiao
I forgot  all about  this fight ,day of  watching  UFC 268  instead 😳  smh canelo The best of now but never can be the best  ever  that is and always will be Floyd
Saúl canelo Álvarez campeón en cuatro categorías el mejor libra por libra......
Great fight by canelo but this video will definitely be studied by his next opponent. He got exposed. Plant got wrecked but pretty much sacrificed himself to get set blueprints on canelo
All hail King Canelo!!!!
cAleB iS goInG to pULL aN uPsEt. Where's the people talking smack now?
You can see Canelo producing 560lbs of torque with his left leg shooting up to his left arm and BAM!!💥SPECTACULAR!!
Plant should fight Charlo, Andrade, Spence, Beterbeiv, AJ...if he want's a rematch with Canelo!
Please for the love of god ….fight someone who will come to fight and not survive on their back foot all night charlo or David will get the job done
Congrats Canelo.... Stay away from Beterbiev.
Looks so phony it’s not even funny
Plant just let him walk right up to him no punches or nothing. #goodfight.
Steroids  is a hell of a drug
Canelo beating another noname and massive underdog...woow, what a king. Where are fights with Charlo, Benavides Andrade, Beterbiev, Spence or any established pound for pound fighter?
😳fuck,,,
Canelo still champion
Anyone who honestly thought plant stood a chance, you are fucking stupid, give canelo his props nobody stopping him right now
Viva México🇲🇽
Saul “El Puerco Sucio” Alvarez got his fixed fight
Plant tried to fight him like Mayweather did in 2013 but forgot to actually punch back.
King Canelo!  Definitely an honor to be able to witness this great moment for Canelos journey a true Boxing skilled Champion. Congratulations Canelo in the unification of belts. Viva team Canelo
nO bOXING nO lIFE
Wow how he's beating Caleb
Respect to Caleb for performing better then expected but like Canelo said There is levels to this  What a beast
Well he Canelo did say he had something special for him
Caleb is tougher than I thought
Respect to Caleb he put up a better fight then canelo last 3 opponents
I swear I'm psychic! I predicted Canelo would win!! Crazy
Alot of Canelo haters real quite right now 😏
I know cánelo is liked by a lot of people but I hate him idk why, just wanna see him lose to talk shit 😭😭😂
Tirando payasos.
Booooooooriiiiing
Why do these refs stop these fights early? I know it looked bad but I don't think he was hurt. Canelo just knocked him down again. He was getting back up. He's a champ. You have to give him a chance.
Alot of hater gonna hate . But did Mayweather do this no. i don't see Mayweather on that list. Haha 😄 😄
Eddie reynoso and trevor witman fought tonight for the best p4p coach
If you didn't gain any respect for Plant after 11 rounds with the #1 ranked boxer in the world you're a clown.
I told you.  Did anyone really think Caleb stood a chance against Canelo?
When Canelo ran after Plant, it reminded me of when I was working capturing chickens to return to the cages on the farm where i worked in North Dakota.
Caleb was in there with the big dog, hats off to him, fuck what a hater got to say, casuals gone talk shit
That's a bad man
P4p king canelo respect
The pressure Canelo applied in the 10th foreshadowed the KO in the 11th.
What a crazy 2021 run for Canelo. Definitely 2021 Fighter of the Year. 👏👏👏
Nothing but respect for Caleb Plant. He was a great champion and great person.
I told yall canelo a 🦁 and 🪴 was a 🐈 when inside the ring with canelo 🤣🥊 canelooooo let's go let's be honest canelo the best in the 🌎 nobody beats him in this generation
If you paid attention at the start of the round Reynoso told him something like "it's time" and he went and KOd him
Plant had good defense like Mayweather, but I think he got over confident in letting his hands down low, he should have taken advantage in the early rounds with body shots and kept jabbing. I will think there will be a rematch, Plant gave a good fight.
Plant was used to fighting at a certain pace bc of his style that would usually keep fighters under his control. Canelo made Plant fight at a heavier pace in the first half of the fight. Throwing more punches than he's accustomed to. Taking bigger steps than what he normally wants & anticipating shots which drains more energy than people realize. Rewatch the fight from the 6th round forward. Canelo completely changed his intensity & started walking him down. At the elite level everyone has a chin and if u don't have good power u wont be able to keep anyone honest bc they know that they can walk through your punches. The most impressive part of the fight is that the Shoulder Roll is usually the best protection against the left hook. But Canelo was smart enough to shorten the hook to hit the exposed front part of the head. Understand how much skill it takes to hit a head with a guard up where there is such a small window to land.
I mean whos heard of Caleb before this fight lol...
Good thing I ordered ufc268 instead of this boring ass fight
At what point do you guys think Plant realized he fucked up taking this fight?
Caleb “Pillow Fists” Plant....Canelo walked through everything Plant was throwing at him. Never even hurt him, ever...
I knew Canelo was going to win! It was obvious
Man I was like Cleb RUN run run hurry FK he got you
Fight went exactly how envisioned it. Plant looks good early. Canelo feels him out. Then slowly breaks him down. And gets a K.O or T.K.O in the late rounds
Canelo the best pound for pound  the best on the world on boxing  ...viva canelo. Canelo time
el canelo es puñal
That’s what I thought mfers!! For those who were saying that plant was going to win?? What do you have to say cabrones!!!
Love the crowds reactions after every hit lol 😂💪
Canelo is a mfn BEAST, Puro orgullo MEXICANO 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
There are LEVELS to this game, Caleb! Let's fucking gooo Canelo!!
Nah this shit was crazy but these are the only full highlights i can find rn for it https://youtu.be/jVsr99e6Y64
4 FIGHTS 4 BELTS.! 1 year!
Mexico Numero One Bitch
Canelo showed these white boys he's the ultimate white boy. 😌😂😂😂
All this fight shows me is Canelo could NEVER beat Floyd no matter how much experience he has. Plant with only 21 fights was giving Canelo trouble and Plants defense and stamina is NOWHERE near Floyd’s
Plant looked nice in the early rounds he really did but it looked like it took alot of focus and energy and i knew he wouldn't be able to keep it up as the rounds went on. Idc what anyone says Caleb showed us a good performance its just that Canelo is different.
Wow canelo he's the king of that division
Canelo is juiced 😬😬😬
Not a good night for USA 😆
What did that PBC host say after the fight lmao
Canelo fan, but I wish the best for Plant and his family. Plant has a heart of Gold. God bless him and his fans! 🙏❤️
Almost like Shawn porter who got knocked down near the end of the good fight
Plant was getting up
Plant Will Beat Eveybody In The Comments 😂.. Goodnight
I’m sorry y’all... this looked like a fixed fight. Plant dodged much more faster punches and other punches hit plant as well... it’s almost like it was time for him to go down. Dude punched him in the ear and neck... are you serious?????
Thanks too y'all haters
Man!! Canelo is in another level!!
Anyone peep Mike Tyson watching in the audience with a white light shining on his head and shoulders? Powerful imagery.
We do not celebrate Ped violators or cycles!
If you think Mayweather is the greatest to step into the ring then you must concede that logan Paul is now the greatest to step in...
One moment of not being position determined a split decision vs knockout...Plant great defensive fighter has no power that's his issue, GGG, plant his best in recent years need to see him fight the real top guys Benavides, Charlo, ...I don't count Kovalev something was off if u know what I mean $$
🌱 Fought to sweet.... 💯 You Have To Put Some🔥 On Them Shots To Beat Nelo.... And Have The Straight To Go 12 Champion Ship Rounds Are Everything 💯
and then again dont thrash talk cause you have to eat your own words
Ma boy ma g ma chavalon arriva canelo Alvarez
BJS did more damage to Canelo cause he actually came to fight. Canelos right hand kept working the body and eventually he caught him lacking and the rest is history.
When keeping it real goes wrong
Who’s this guy Caleb 🤷🏻‍♂️
Everybody hating on Plant but dude survived 11 rounds with a beast..
So glad i was able to see is fight in Arlington
"caleb got good defense"  you better have good defense with no offense
Looks like Canelo had him Planted to the ground...
Canelo won
and gay Paul fake boxer wannabe want to fight cannelo ?
Canelo made plant dance jarabe tapatio after the first knock
Alvarez is one of the greatest ever, make no mistake, with much more greatness to come. Just an impressive, impressive boxer. Credit to Plant for lasting four more rounds than I thought he would.
Props to plant he lasted longer then anybody thought
Good fight congratulations to Canelo good efforts Plant Canelo was a little to experience for u young man showed heart much Respect very entertaining fight the best man won but the fans won as well they got they money's worth good skills displayed in this fight 💯
Plant was planted to the floor.😛
Charlo is next no matter what canelo does people are going to hate on the P4P king
There’s levels to this shit lol
Jake aint  got shit on this bro
All you Plant boot lickers have anything to say?  I’m sure you’ll come up with another excuse 05/2022.
Otro costal más al canelo felicidades
Told you!! Just like Saunders!! Much respect to Caleb tho for taking the fight! He's a true warrior!
Congrats bro now the undisputed champion
Wah Hoppin??? jajajajaj
Ganó bien el señor Canelo , felicidades 🥂
Probably the best fight I’ve seen out of Canelo’s career. It wasn’t predictable. It was art how Canelo mastered and unlocked Plants form of fighting
I feel so sorry for anyone who wasted their money on scripted WWE *i mean* boxing matches meanwhile a stacked UFC card is going on
Ahh ref
He thought he was Floyd
Caleb plant fought his ass off but not just wasn't enough at the end.
Canelo: "You know what I do."  "You're going to something very special."  Plant:   zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 💤😴💤😴💤😴💤  Yes, Nelo..... It was special.   Thank you- Canelo Fan.
Best in the world, with all due respect to Fury, Crawford and Spence.
Caleb earned my respect! That guy has nothing but heart. Though fighter!  He is definitely a tough opponent for David Benavides
You know when Caleb found out?   “When it was too late!”
Me as a Mexican proud girl I’m so proud of our Mexican Friday because he won and he showed people that he knows how to respect people
He did fuck him up like he promised
Still a cheat PED user !
VIVA LA MIGRA....DEBAJO MEXICO!
Viva king canelo
I wonder did he take PEDS for this fight?? 🤔
Lol canelo wanted to kill him
Reminder: VADA drug tests...let's see what's next. Did Mr. Plant sacrifice for the sport?  You guest it!  Bye Mr. Alvarez!
canelo ducking goku
Caleb Plant fought his heart out. What a fight!
Early stoppage. He was hurt but not knocked out, but thats the world of today’s sports. Soft
Canelo planted Plant 😎💪!
Caleb did better than I thought he'd do. He had his moments of the fight and took some good shots. The left hook that got past his guard is the shot that hurt him bad and was the start of the end.
GGG and Mayweather mopped canelo easy
plant looked like dude from friday when he ran to the corner i literally said he gone cry in the car lol
Saludos a todos las envidiosas!  Enjoy the highlights Canelo haters!
If Canelo and Mayweather fought in prime it might have been different
Mayweather better
There's Noone else besides benavidez and charlo. Let's see 😅. And yall gotta feel dumb hating on plant all week. He did better than everybody canelo been fighting
We are witnessing a destroyer in prime one day we will tell our young ones how great canelo was just like our grandparents tell us about ali and other great boxers from the old days.
BRAVO 🌱 PLANT
Just wow 🔥
Haven't seen this many fake punches since WWE. Each fight they get worse at acting.
Just like that i love when he destroys the people that talk the most trash
Mexico keeping boxing alive
Well... IT'S OFFICIAL... I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME CLANBUTERAL... AND MAKE IT A PART OF MY DAILY SUPPLEMENTS REGIMENT... SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS EL' NEGERO TAKE VADA... I BELIEVE IF YOU INSIST ON HAVING HIM SIGN UP FOR VADA HE WON'T FIGHT YOU,, HE'LL GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A CHANCE TO GET THAT PAYDAY/BEAT DOWN..
He went down like a broken banana 🍌 pil
He was using the pressure stalker style that guys like Chavez, Frazier, and Liston would use in their careers. Canelo did it to show he can pull off a different style and still win. He wanted to show he can pull of that rugged Mexican slugger style. Fact is, if he fought plant like the way he fought against Triple G this fight would have ended by round 4/5. Smart move on his part and well played.
Caleb "Face" Plant.
Anyone know the name of the song that starts playing at 1:15
Best Mexican is white AF.
VivaMexico!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽🥊🥊💥💥
The other champions should do the same they fight once a year this guy fought like three times in a year he stays busy
He gonna cry in the car
Canelo haters are at least happy they didn’t have the balls to bet against him 😂😂 bunch of clowns
Shocker.. Was there any doubt...  got planted like all the rest 🤭🙂😁😆😅🤣🤣
He already was looking nervous at the weigh in
They should have either showed more highlights or made this video shorter showing the knockdowns!
Just makes Floyd's win over him more impressive
Viva Mexico Cabrones!!! 🇲🇽
Plant, has gained my respect. I'm sure I'm not the only one.
I won 100,000 ......in this fight ...easy money
Floyd still > canelo 🚬😹
His coach told him go get him and he did
It took a lot longer for Canelo to overcome Caleb, but in the end, the result come on as predicted. We must give Plant a lot of credit for standing up and fighting fiercely and with heart. I think he gave Canelo more trouble than the previous three fighters before him. Much respect for Caleb Plant.!!
Unreal
You got to give it up to plant though he made it to the 11th round all the other guys that were supposed to be better than him didn't make it to that round look at saunders
November 6th 2021 both sports UFC 268 & Canelo vs plant showtime ppv both delivered greats fights. Canelo becomes first 168lbs undisputed champion. Usman, & Thug rose both retained their ufc titles in their respected rematches
That uppercut is the divisions nightmare. Honestly the only fighter who deserves a fight with Canelo in the 168 division is Benavidez. Being that he lost his belt on the scales. Run it. King Canelo 💪🏾
It is what is is guys, say all the excuses. At the end of the day canelo won🤷🏿‍♂️
Another unworthy opponent. He's busy dodging Charlo. He avoids black boxers like the plague
Talking all that & got knock out
Plant never has a chance canelo is just beast is in another level king canelo need to fight goku or may be vegeta
Canelo pulls through
CANELO FOR PRESIDENT 👑👑🇲🇽
Referee to Caleb: "You wanna fight?" Caleb (fiercely): "YEAH." Calebs inner thoughts: 'I really don't want to.'
Plant has his ass I aint gonna lie if it went all thr way plant had the fight...he was treating the shit out of canelo
Me caia mal  pero aora me di cuenta ke estab ekivocado .  Es muy buen boxeador  y ke bueno ke le pego asi por bocon
Good nigth Caleb Plant.  You Choose to fight  Mexican Bruce Lee.
They gave canelo the perfect fight, easy to beat  a boxer who throws baby jabs. And show no aggression
The King!!!! 🇲🇽💪🏻🥊🥊💥💥🔥🔥🔥
Plant looked like he wanted to run out the Ring after he got up from 1st knockdown 0:08
CONGRATS TO CANELO. SO CALLUM SMITH, ALVI YILDRIM, BILLY JOE SAUNDERS AND CALEB PLANT RIGHT ? YALL ENJOYED THOSE?  HE GAVE PAYDAYS TO ALL THESE FIGHTERS ABOVE!   OKAY. NOW LETS SEE SOME REAL ELITE SHIT. CHARLO, DEMETRIUS, DAVID BENAVIDEZ.. CANELO HAS NO WHERE ELSE TO GO! Looking forward to these fights.
Plant still made it. How many fighters you know out of Tennessee that are fighting on ppv.  Good shit bro.
El Cinnamon committed to the body early. He got Plant’s hands to drop just enough for the left to connect flush late.
How Can it be Canelo Averez....👍😲👍
Canelo showing that slick defensive style has been cracked. Boxing evolves so that difficult style is no more. Tonight it showed that relentless pressure and power body punching and left hooks etc.. is the way to get trough that.
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣BOXING IS A CORRUPT SPORT,  WHO IARE ALL THE GUYS WHO CANELO BEAT THE BELTS FROM🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️OTS A JOKE MAKES ME 😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣ODS WERE -1000 in favorite of canelo REALLY???????
Caleb did real well.  This may be the match he needed to make that leap to the next level.  Experience matters.  All hail the king
I woulda liked to see plant switch to a high guard for a round, just to switch it up. Canelo was throwing over plants shoulder and eventually caught him
Canelo is just a best,😁 as I expected both of them fight great but canelo is in another level 😏😁
No surprises at all. We were all waiting for the upset but Canelo is just on a whole different level
Viva canelo y mi Mexico 🇲🇽 lindo soy Boricua pero amo Mexico 🇲🇽 otro bocón destruido la semana pasada fue el Boricua bocón y otro mexicano lo puso a cargar parado 😂😂😂
Caleb earned my respect ✊🏽 . He did will .
Canelo vs Benavidez in May
Plant gave a good fight, he good fighter but Canelo won
Caleb wasn’t ready and not enough experience to face this beast
MMA is officially 100% more exciting than Boxing...
Vivaaa Mexico cabronesss
Everyone laughing at Plant yet all you never laced a pair of gloves. Show respect
🇲🇽🥊
Viva Mexico we the face in boxing
Plant ain’t really want that work!! LISTO PA LOS CHINGAZOS!? SIKEEEEE  And Charlo gon work his ass too
A real boxing fan here .....BENEVIDEZ IS WAITING ....
Same punch he caught Saunders with. FUCK he hits hard. Thought Plant would’ve gave him a better fight. Not easy to showboat and be arrogant when there’s a legit fighter trying to knock your head off. Hopefully this will teach Plant to stay humble.
Plant had moments he could have took advantage of but only having 21 fights will  do that to you we need to see somebody walk canelo down and see if he can fight off his back foot
Canelo haterz will never give him his credit😂😂
He's talked all that shit and Plant got planted on his ass!
Canelo has been snatching niggas 0’s lol hopefully the staying undefeated era is over
PEROOOO SIGOOO SIENDO EL REEEEEEEYYY #KING🤴🏽CANELO🥊
3:37 I don’t know why but that was so satisfying to watch in slow motion. It looks so badass!  GIF worthy for sure. Congratulations; bravo Canelo! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Viva México🇲🇽🇲🇽
White boy is a good actor!! No
Plant is a warrior but Canelo said it, there's levels to this. Canelo will go down as the best Mexican boxer and top 5 boxer of all time.
I called this one canelo by ko.
Hajahahhahahahahahahahha
What the haters want to say know 🤣🤣🤣 next
Hands down if Canelo was this experienced against mayweather at the time he would’ve won.
Floyd never went for undisputed. canelo surpass mayweather.
Welp we tuned in on Nov 6 Caleb andddddd... canelo is who we thought he was
Canelo was losing until he won... "Canelo haters"
Canelo need to get in there with a boxer that can punch . Plant don't hit hard at all
Fight was scripted from the build up and shove to the announcers saying this and that punch are landing and if they called out 5 maybe one grazed a boxer. Snooze fest until the supposed KO. They don't even fight that much to fix these things anymore. Boxing is a bigger lie than pro wrestling.
Mike Tyson called it right.
Canelo is the best boxer in the world right now. He is now truly a real goat and at the level of Floyd Jr if not better.
Viva México cabrones
Canelo is doped on Winnie. (Winstrol)
mike tyson in the background looking real proud.
Caleb didnt put a fight, he was just too long for canelo but as soon as canelo knew the jab and counter wasnt gonna do shiit he got close
Proof Canelo of now (in his prime) would beat Gayweather
undisputed champion!!!
Respect to Plant he fought a good fight even won some rds but Canelo is a legend now.
Hate to say I told you so, but Canelo turned Plant into a vegetable!
He’s the goat 🐐
Enter plant puns.
GGG VS CANELO  1...if it wasn't for that BS draw decision this day would never of happened....crooked judges ruined boxing
Imagine paying $80 just to have the same promoter post a video of the knockout half an hour after the fight
Canelo didn't impress me at all
Damn ufc 268 made this fight look like a joke
Canelo got exposed !
Canelo made Plant bow to the King
unifying one of the weakest divisions in boxing doesn't make canelo great. he just ran through old british men and weak puncher caleb plant. canelo went to 168 cause he knew it was a weak division and he could easily beat them without risking a loss. his fights with ggg were way more competitive.
it's still crazy that floyd mayweather was the only person that could actually defeat this man
Where is Andre Ward at????
Canelo haters before this fight: “Plant will be his toughest fight”  Canelo haters after this fight: “Plant was an easy fight for Canelo, that’s why he picked him on purpose. Obviously he was going to win and I knew it too. But he’ll lose to Charlo and is scared to fight him.”   You people are relentless. At this point just admit you don’t like Canelo and don’t want to give him credit for anything. Stop hiding behind this facade that you know which fighters will beat him because apparently you guys don’t, given the track record.  Callum Smith toughest opponent. But he lost so it doesn’t count. Billy Saunders toughest opponent. But he lost so it doesn’t count. Caleb Plant toughest opponent. But he lost so it doesn’t count.  Charlo toughest opponent. But when he loses, it won’t count. And the cycle will continue.
Goku is all that’s left for man 😂😂
Ese bato es la .mafia ese pinche lla lo están enbestigando algo ai vamos  a ver
IMO Plant was giving Canelo that work until this point and I was surprised!!!! I knew he couldn't afford to get tired but that's something he apparently struggles with. However he was outboxing Canelo and his range and elusiveness seemed to give him trouble. A LOT of people were cheering when Plant was slipping punches Canelo was throwing. Plant did damn good and I'm impressed with him. Happy as hell for Canelo!!!! That's an amazing stamp on history. Congrats champ!!
“ yeah but what about Rocky, God and Michael Jordan? “ - Canelo haters
rekt
Canelo is ducking the king Charlie zelenoff
Where’s all the Nelo haters now?
Shit he fucked him up he killed him he was running for his life.
todos los que le van al canelo se creen que es el mejor pero desde mayweather al unico buen boxeador que se a enfrentado es GGG, y una pelea se la robaron a golobkin, Ahorita ya no ay boxeadores como los de antes por eso esta arriba, canelo esta bien pesadote no tiene tanta mobilidad lo bueno que tiene es que pega fuerte, a este ponganle uno que dure 12 rounds agil ligero y con buen golpe sertero y se lo chinga. Lastima que ya noay boxeadores como chavez paquaio dela hoya marquez
Haters gonna hate
Complete mismatch
I’m just here for the comments that’s all. Let’s keep them coming.
In less than a YEAR 🤯🤯🤯💯🥊🥊
All respect to plant he was way better then I thought he showed beautiful boxing skill and heart
Canelo is thanos at this piont
Viva Mexico cabrones!!!!!!
canelos wife a baddie 🔥
Congrats to Canelo 👏🏽, but I can't lie there ain't 1 elite fighter in that division. They all seem to be clones, BJS, Smith now Plant, boxers who are 1 dimensional with no power 🤷🏽‍♂️. These fights haven't really been competitive ngl, all these guys don't have anything special in their resumes before facing him so what does one expect 🤔.
He runs like if he was trynna run around a pool without getting yelled at
The fight went exactly the way I thought it would .Caleb fought well just you can’t mistakes with Canelo you have to be perfect for 12rds he’ll make you pay if you don’t
I'm a Canelo fan, but Plant shouldn't feel bad , he put up a fight against one of the greatest fighters in boxing of our time. If anything I feel that Plant will learn alot from this loss just like Canelo did from Mayweather
VIVA MEXICO CABRONESSSSS!!! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Shorts dangling wtf cmon this boxing not  a fashion show!
How many black fighters they say before Canelo
Canelo vs Kamaru next. Make it happen Dana and Espinoza
😂😂🤣Canelo power is unreal…. These dudes be game until them body shots start adding up by rd 5 your pretty much in retreat mode
And that's what happens when you talk about Canelo's mama! Viva México! 🇲🇽
Geezus, he’s going to have to go to wwe to get their belts too
Canelo won considering Plant fought the whole fight with his left hand
I knew plant was in trouble because he didn’t have the power to back canelo up…
boy a apostar cuando canelo se enfrente a un boxsiador de verdada como maywheder
Plant's got nothing to be ashamed of! Did better than your favorite boxer, until the 11th.
Screw everyone in the comments. Period.
I’m convinced that if the current canelo had fought prime mayweather, canelo would’ve won. 10 years ago canelo wasn’t close to the fighter he is now and he still barely lost to prime Floyd.
All those shit talkers said Canelo would lose but this happens.
Canelo has to be at least top 5 to ever lace em up and that’s 100. And no he not the BEST to ever do it. Shut up with that he’s not right now but he has a high chance to be if he keeps it up for 4 more years.
😄😄😄que bien le quedo su actuación al costal ese
When will the shit talkers.. Get punch after the match.. If they win the shit talking doesn't stop..but, they get knocked out.." Oh I was wrong it wasnt my night." BS.. Deserve no respect. And a Good punch afterwards is what they deserve.
I said it!! Canelo power is what makes him so great!!! He was not out boxing Plant at all!!!!!!! But he has fight changing power!!!
The best Mexican boxer?
That meat from Mexico must be good
What happened Plant?  You were going to do what !??  Yeah !!! Lmao
The way canelo runs after him🤣🤣
I'm not a Canelo fan but this was a good fight and he deserves respect for making history.
Didn’t Caleb say he was going to show canelo something? I didn’t see him do anything. #CANELOISTHEGOAT🐐🐐
This fight for plant was like Canelos fight with Floyd. Experience and lessons learned. Incredible performance from plant against the best p4p. After watching this I believe that plant will come back and be world champion again one day.
Canelo jus wilted 🥀 plant
😲The real golden boy.
Jajjajajaja. Buena actuación xel tipo
Horrible to try to compete with ufc at the same time smh
Damm I thought canelo would ko plant in the 7 rounds. Props for plant for being a warrior and serving longer than anybody else.
Magnificent
Dammm. 💯 🥊
Id like to see gayweather fight canelo now in his prime!
You got knocked the FK UP !!
These fighters were undefeated till they face Canelo.
Plant out here running like red from Friday
Hats off to Canelo for sure, but his fans were classless. Booing after a great fight by respectable pugilists.
GOD BLESS CALEB PLANT AND FAMILY…THIS IS ONLY A FIGHT AND MY RESPECT TO CALEB PLANT THE CHAMPION..NOW WHAT THE HATERS HAVE TO SAY????????AHORA LOS Q LE LLAMAN CANELA O COMO SEA Q LE LLAMABAN A CANELO…???MEJOR DÉJENSE DE TONTERÍAS Y ENSEÑEN Q HACEN USTEDES POR SU VIDA POR SU ÉXITO..POR SU FAMILIA???INSPIRAS A ALGUIEN A SER MEJOR???COMO CANELO??? MEJOR APOYEMOS A LOS DEPORTISTAS MEXICANOS Y A TODOS ES LO MEJOR ASÍ SEAS DE CUALQUIER PAÍS SIGUE Y LUCHA POR TUS SUEÑOS..DIOS BENDIGA A CANELO FAMILIA Y QUE LO CYIDE Y NO CAIGA EN MALOS HÁBITOS.. MUCHAS BENDICIONES 🙏🙏🙏MR ÁLVAREZ Y ARRIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽 Y USA 🇺🇸
that left hook and follow by uppercut well KO
Canelo beating up Walmart workers and making millions.👏
Meh,,, I’m still buthurt he couldn’t drop mayweather,,,
People hating on Plant he gave Canelo problems
Just because nobody boxes anymore. If all the ufc guys was boxers these guys wld be nothing  !!
I really glad floyd won against canelo cuz i cant stand his hardcore fans
Woah he ran after Caleb that was BADASS! and it'd be dope to see him fight Usyk or Benevidez next.
As an American of Mexican descent, Caleb made us Americans proud 🇺🇸. CP apologize to Canelo and took his loss like a man!
Well when him n Floyd gonna run it back?
I can’t hear 👂 canelos haters nomore what HAPPEN!?!? Caleb knocking out who ? OH AIIGHT..
De Guanatos (GDL) - Canelo dio una leccion de lo que es un depredador - Paciencia - Endurance - Talento - Canelo es de la misma ciudad de donde es Checo Perez (F1) - Ciudad de campeones - Hoy Canelo demostro porque es campeon del mundo en diferentes divisiones/pesos - Los que lo odian ya tienen un motivo mas para odiarlo :)
All that juice and politics gotta help... Ya know
Canelo chased him like a hound dog after a rabbit
0:34 when you get home from work tired AF and you throw yourself in the bed and instantly pass out!!!
He was never able to dominate GGG like he does with most his opponents, had it not being for corrupt suspended judge adelaide bird, GGG would've been the undisputed unified champ of the world then. Props to canelo he does great but GGG won the first fight eveyone agrees to that,... he got here on a paid corruption ticket. Facts
My respects for caleb , great fighter & he’ll bounce back. Viva Mexico
Hahahha what were you saying bocon !! Viva Mexico !!
Great fight i thought it was pretty even up until the 11th
This nigga went to afterlife
that jog after the rope thing lol
Same way he took out kovalev
Canelo is Ducking ET...
"Oh hail King Canelo! Viva Mexico's first Undisputed Champion"
Here we go all Caleb fans making up excuses, shut the f up and take the L. Put some respect on the P4P King Canelo🤴
Wooooooooo Let Go!!! Canelo Amazing Knockout 🥊 🇲🇽 Much Respect
En estos mismos momentos no hay nadie , nadie que le pueda ganar al Canelo , ni en las 160 ni en las 168 , si sube a las 175 posiblemente.
as anyone with a brain predicted lol. props to Plant, he is all the man I will never be but come on
Respect to Plant for a great fight even tho it played out the way it did.   A lot of quiet keyboards right now. Where’s all the brave hearts that swore Caleb was going to KO Canelo??? Keep that same energy. Time to man up & congratulate the new undisputed king.
0:22 bro canelo literally danced to caleb like he was chasing a little kid
White boy learned tonight. 🤕🥴👊 Viva Mexico cabrones🇲🇽🇲🇽🌶️🌶️
Fake ass fixed fights smh.
Wow
i knew he was going to loose he a rookie thinking he big shot
i wanted caleb to win but i give it to canelo and caleb. caleb lasted longer then billy joe saunders i give it to caleb. he fought the best and thats whats gonna make him a better fighter.
canelo reunited Caleb with his daughter
Saitama Inu get your bag  still time!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Canelo 🇲🇽
Caleb and billy joe would be a good fight
What a great fight.. let’s go Brandon I mean Canelo😂
Caleb plant was super tough too , great fight
Thanks Canelo, I lost $100 bet
Ruiz in the backround has no reaction like it happens 24/7 meanwhile everyone else goes crazy lmao
Wow canelo has beaten every undefeated fighter in his weight class. Thats legendary
I dedicate this fight of canelo,to all the haters, and to all the stupid comments, about canelo,!!!asi nomas o les guizo un huevo,
I didntnsee the whole.fight yet but I'll give plante credit I didn't expect him to make round 11
Canelo hardly even threw jabs I was actually worried for a sec xD Respect to Plant, he just got taxed... couldnt quite make it to the end.
Canelo is the best Boxer of this Generation  .   Undisputed Champion.   No wonder he's #1P4P King      🥊
😂who thought plant could actually win😂 😂The media tried to make us believe 😂 Didn’t spend a dime on this fight 👍🏽
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽CANELO👑🔥🔥🔥
Te dije no lo hagas enojar.... Lo toma muy personal...?
Only mayweather can beat Canelo and that was accomplished by Mayweather already, Sorry to tell no white dude can beat Canelo until he retires.
All hail king Canelo
Today was full of respect, Usman and Colby finished the rivalry with respect and same here congratulations to the champions
Just makes you realize how good GGG is for beating him twice
My sincere apologies for making the wrong call. Canelo deliberately took him into the deep end.
Foh.  That same ref gave Fury three years to get up.
Saled plants go 😪😴
Muy buen oponente mis respetos caleb  muy macho fue bueno pero fue mejor el canelo
All that talk about beating canelo. Just to end up PLANTed 😂
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
All the real Niggas know canelo dodge the real real niggas… read that slow and u understand bruh
why Andy Ruiz in the back not even showing emotion for his teammate tho...
I've been saying it for a long time, canelo Alvarez is the GOAT. Floyd mayweather WHO ?
its like plants ear lobe was swinging
Caleb over here running like Red in Friday after Debo took his chain!
I wish the ref didn’t stop it. Plant needed a little more of a beat down.
what a legend, man
Its those nopales
What's these black folks and LDBbCC haters gone say now? Canelo scared to fight black boxer,,, 😂😂😂😂 lol. Canelo fought nobody he needs to fight Fury lol.
Buelvete a enfrentar a canelo para que te de la madrisa de tu vida
Mexican power!!!!
Respect to both fighters🇲🇽🇺🇸
plant fans Hella silent now
0:22 dear god that was terrifying
Holy fuck Canelo is more savage than I thought! That loss to Floyd changed him for sure.
He breaks fighters down methodically. You can't account for his power , thts wht separates him from the rest tht one hitter quitter changes it all. Plant should have taken a knee to compose because there was a disconnect from the brain to the legs. His career is far from over this is a good loss because he still has alot left and there's still good fights out there for him. Respect to Plant.  Without a doubt Canelo is king of 168 and I tip my hat to him. It wasn't his best performance but his power and instincts can bail him out at anytime..
Andre ward is punching air right now 😂
Ahuevos Canelo 💪
Plant is not a bad guy i don’t know why poeple are so rude with im all my congratulations to canelo
David benavidez will give canelo a hard time set it up
People now realize how good Floyd Mayweather was. He taught Canelo how to box
Canelo gonna have to buy a frieghtliner to carry all those belts.
Fake Champion Canelo is. All this crap is scripted like rest of trash sports. Booooooooooooooo!!!!!!👎👎👎👎👎👎
I only thing I miss about dazn is that they put the whole fight up after 😒
100
https://youtu.be/U-AH8rww6AE
beat his ass & made him say sorry to his mama. canelo you are a bad man my fren. 😅😮‍💨
Another way to look at it is that plant beat the hell out of canelos fists with his head. Those fists took a devasting pounding.
canelo haters mad rn
it’s crazy to think Canelo used to fight at 154lbs lol  he’s wiping out these heavier divisions
Respect to Plant, from a Canelo fan, dude went out on his shield! 👍🏽
ALL RESPECT TO PLANT TRUE WARRIOR!!!🙏💪
Plant threw himself canelo ain’t ko shit
I understand why people like canelo he’s a humble person I like his personality but bro he really does have more to prove than just beating plant and has to step up to the bigger dogs to prove his true worth🤷🏻‍♂️
Pero CANELO is CANELO 🥊🇲🇽✨✨
Everytime he wins, the haters look dumber and dumber. Its become easier to spot the low IQ people.
Plant got planted...(I couldn't wait to write that).
Thanks Caleb for selling out
STEROIDS WORKS!  🤦‍♂️
Sigues tu maywather tu que eres bueno dando consejos todavia no estas viejo no se como ganastes todas tus peleas solo corriendo y marrullerias
I think caleb is a problem for anyone at 168 after this. Would love to see canelo push himself and take on bivol or somethin. But I dont think the light heavys can even touch him lol
to bad Canelo didn't unify the 160 division when their was only one belt left 🤔
I said Caleb would put up a fight and he did but as we all expected, Canelo would win because he's just on another level than these guyz. The only one that stands the best chance against him in that division is Benavidez. Charlo's only chance is his power. Beterbiev stands a huge chance with his boxing iq and massive power but his chin and defense is a bit sus. I'd love to eventually see Terence Crawford face Canelo cause I rlly think he stands the best chance against Canelo right now skill-wise.
A huge congrats Canelo!!!!
He couldn’t beat floyd
Just another Mexican planting a plant 🧑🏻‍🌾
Plant vs sanders
Those haters mad as hell right now.
Canelo vs Benavidez, that's what we want to see!
Where the fuck was he running to? 🤣
Benavidez is next
Caleb tried to mayweather canelo with that Philly shell I'm glad canelo found his way
Tyson TOLD ya'll!!!!
Canelo looked average as hell lol mayweather still beats this dude
The only way too beat canelo is to walk him down Benevidaz is a problem
That fucker needs to get his blood tested ASAP cause how the fuck does he carry his power to the later rounds. Very suspicious to me.
Is GGG retired ?
Made a lot of money
Go get em Canelo!
If u don’t have canelo #1 p4p ur hating at this point.
The thing about cáñelo is that, even tho he can knock you out in the 1-2 round, he’s gonna give people what they paid for, a show, not a preview
PLANT LOOKING LIKE FORREST GUMP RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE HAHAH.
Fakest stoppage I’ve ever seen
My man got Belts on Belts!!
So all the trash talk from this clawn for nothing.
Any more excuses......
🏆🇲🇽 Canelo Alvarez viva México 🏆
plant thought he was in the middle of a marathon run when he got up
I saw plant walk to his corner after the 10th round and I knew he was done in the 11th
I would love to see Mayweather in his prime fight Canelo right now in his prime. That would be insane
Rumors are Caleb has broke ribs....
Buena pelea
Ref was like you want to fight Plant: yeah👹👹👹 then he proceeds to run away
After having a bad week, losing money and getting into an accident. I get to enjoy watching a canelo fight. It's like a light at the end of the tunnel. CANELO is invencible
I got to give up. Canelo is that guy
We he slip on that slap from the brawl i knew canelo was gonna destroy plant lol
Gano el payaso canelo
Caleb w.e you say after this point is invalid... You got knocked out... VIVA MEXICO!!!!!!!!!!!
Caleb tried his best. Followed the game plan. Kept Canelo working hard trying to figure him out which I dont think Canelo did BUT that body shot assault from the middle rounds forward sealed the deal. Its hard to figure out what actual strategy could be effective against ginger.  Plant once again exposed Canelo's footwork deficiencies, but he is still able to find a way inside, and once he is in range he is poised enough to get his preferred shots going, even if Caleb made him miss badly at times.
Nice 👍🏼
Plant child is ashamed in heaven 🤣
Great fight by Caleb but Canelo proved that he’s definitely the best and why. Canelo is still the king, no doubt. Future is bright for Caleb though this won’t be the last time we see him.
Caleb got KTFO!
canelo duckin logan and jake paul and dillon danis
Thank you showtime for showing the highlights unlike the UFC
Anyone can run block and throw a jab 4 long time but eventually u will get caught with a shot the weak sauce fighting man fight toe to toe
I don't know about you guys but in the end I did feel a lot of sadness who Canelo knocks out Caleb plant!!
Somebody tell me was it a beating or did Caleb do ok?
What up Floyd
Caleb plant got knocked tf out ..he said let me lay here on tge ground with one leg over the rope... no f..... given lol
Sooooooooooooo Faaaaaaaakkkkkkkkeeeeeee!!!!!!! WWE 😁😁😁😁
Omg
Maywheather! 😂
Canelos mom would be proud
I got my money 💵 💵 💵 💵💵! Thanks Canelo!
Number one
Jake paul would destroy this man canelo easy 😂😂
Nice. He can fight the undefeated jake paul now
Like Canelo said Plant was not on his level 🤣 viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Charlie z is the G.O.A.T!
Respect to plant did better then everyone thought he would! Did way better then billy my eye is broke Saunders awesome fight by both guys but canelo is just leagues ahead of the game congrats to the now undisputed 👑!!!
That one pound short in weight in his soul was out a day earlier
Bro I ran out of my house screaming he’s the best Mexican fighter don’t care what anybody says and he will be one of the all time greats
Plant took a dive
Canelo diffidently needed that knockout the way he ran 😂
Bruh from Ufc to boxing tonight was fucking insane
Let's get Mayweather vs canelo plz
That tells you how good Golovkin is
Caleb still the second best in the division, that says something
Where are all the canelo haters!?
Man that's gotta be the scariest thing u can experience in the ring. Having canelo run at u like that while the crowd hypes him up.
Lol all that trash talking went down the drain hahaha
I bet 10 to12 canelo by ko...🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Canelo just knew he got him and didn’t even let him clinch. And found the uppercut in that small gap. Killer Instinct.
Eddie Reynoso looking like a planet in there💯🌎🙊
Porque canelo es Mira mas grande mss grande el dinero abla dijo Babb arom
*Thanelos*
Left side of plant was cracked
Tell canelo to go fight them real fighters that’ll put that shit on him!!!
Good shit Plant, you were gonna win or get carried out. True warrior, rest up, no shame I'm losing to an all time great..
Maybe the Stupid Bum,  Plant will Respect a Figher next time !!!
Whoever thought Plant actually had a chance can hold this L
These guys are not elite boxers. The only elite boxers of today are fury and usyk.
Showtime learning from the DAZN. I paid for the fight. Thank you for not being greedy with the highlights.
I knew this was the outcome
I always root for the American, but there is no way you can say Canelo isn’t the truth, he’s a monster, he’s got all the tools. And Mexican style is just pure entertainment.
Haha
All hail king canelo hell yes
This was a great fight to watch and kept me on the edge of my seat every round. Much respect to Caleb for showing insane speed and heart, but Canelo is just built different.
Caleb face plant.
Man! Poor plant
I want to see plants hospital bill
00:26 Sweet little jig dance by Plant
Nobody deserves it more than Canelo! Caleb still has a big future tho
CANELO IS CANELO! THE 👑 KING.
What that song in the background
Plant got payed off.He took a dive also.All of the white boxers don't love boxing, they love money more.
Dude he should go Shannon Briggs on mayweather just to be a dick , demand a rematch
So satisfying 😌 to watch. Only thing missing is him getting buried next to his daughter. Canelo is the King 🤴  SAVAGE ASF- F*** your feelings.
5.
Plant was winning till the hook landed.  My man hit the money phone before the fight and took them pointers from TBE.  Canelo was getting out boxed and desperate, hell he was missing all night till the KO
if you look at the bottom tight corner at 1:59 you can see Andy Ruiz all smiling seems happy enough lol.
What song is playing in the background
Big payday for both fighters!  Plant's only 29 with one loss.  He WILL be back!😎😎😎😎😎😎
I knew he was gonna execute that beautiful left and then the upper 🥊🐐
That was an improper Mayweather shoulder roll defense. The left shoulder rolls around, and the right hand is up high to protect the head! The right hand was low! And, Canelo hit an open head target. A high right hand would have blocked that punch! It was lazy defense by Caleb Plant!
Still lost to Mayweather though...
He gotta  fight David B that is the only fight that makes any sense
"ALL HAIL KING CANELO!" Couldn't have said it better myself.
Plant was schooling him most of the fight but got caught.
I saw 5 seconds of the fight and straight out noticed canelo is on steroids. Lol.
?
I told Canelos haters that he was going to TKO plant in a amazing way and I was right.
Tyson was right 😮
I guess caleb was NOTready for LOS CHINGAZOS.JAJAJA.
To challenge
Why did Charli not come
Canelo did what we thought he would so can't hate on him the only thing idc about canelo for is that he has been caught doing ped twice and other situations of cheating so people acting like he's perfect and never did steroids is bs imo either way Caleb wasn't ready for that type of experience like canelo fighters have
Please don't mention that clown Jake Paul. He is not a worthy opponent because he is not a true professional fighter. He only fights old retired boxers like the bully he is. I can't wait to see a young boxer like Canelo whip his A...and put him in a hospital.
THE BEST OF THE BEST MANA  THE FIGTH STILL A SHOW !  Come on ! Get a real fight !
THE GOAT has spoken!!!!  WOW
All is Fake. All is Mafia......
Caleb’s got the right mentality and he damn sure has heart! This won’t be the last time we see him Canelo is the greatest of his generation, not even up for discussion!
It NEVER pays to talk SHIT
To my champion 🏆 Canelo God bless you and your family I love the way he put it to plant one of your biggest fan Irma Real from Fresno cal.viva Mexico great job Canelo
He is in his prime he can’t be stopped right now… he is the best P4P fighter in the world right now. No doubt
I never seen a Championship boxer try to run away from his opponent.  Well Foreman vs Frazier
Canelo to plant GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!! 🤣
I see 18 haters pushed thumbs down 😂 BUT THEY STILL KEEP WATCHING CANELOS FIGHTS 😂 ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE HATERS..SEE YALL NEXT FIGHT
😂😂😂 weak ass plant lmfaooo
Premature Stoppage
Hunting season.
MÉXICO MÉXICO MÉXICO 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🐍🦅👑✝️
Where are those plant fans now lol...
Talked alot of trash to end up running
Who wanted to see this garbage fight 😆.
what an amazing night in combat sports
Canelo needs to fight ggg. I knew plant is a hen for sure canelo was gonna win
Canelo gonna lose tonight to that gawkgawk 1 billion
As Mexican who is not biased, I had plant winning by 2-3 rounds. He spitfire jabs and combos gave Canelo problems from the start. But wow he hurt him to quick. Caleb really last longer than expected, my respect. I think he’s the first fighter to beat every champion who was undefeated to become undisputed. And one each belt one by one.
Well, looks like Eddy Reynoso got his birthday present as promised.  They're a great team, they've worked hard and they deserve everything they've accomplished...
Puro Jalisco
i told yall he not ready lol
Lol canelo said hell yea let me finish this nigga
Team Canelo!!! I Respect CALEB no Cap I hope he keeps fighting and becomes a champ again! Plant needs a new coach Fr Keep that head up Caleb one L ain’t nothin.
Carmelo looked UNTOUCHED by the end
KING CANELO...! BOW DOWN BITCHES... CANT TOUCH THE KING OR HIS CROWN. THIS MAN IS THE BEST OF THE BEST NO ARGUMENT THERE, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN HATER MAY NOT LIKE HIM BUT TO FUCKIN BAD THATS THE WAY IT IS... 100 PERCENT.
KAREN PLANT😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Charlo
Charlo
The druggy won, big surprise
Next fight: Canelo vs Hulk Hogan

Charlo! Next.
Thanos and Canelo both got 6 letters in their names..coincidence?? #everythingperfectlybalance
Charlo is gonna resign soon.
Mexico indepence today
Don't feel bad for plant, tonight he built generational wealth so even his great grand kids won't have to worry about money.
Has anyone ever seeing that ref though
Bro got knocked out in front of his wife
Viva Canelo
Goooooooooo damn
Bruh Canelo need to stop ducking Goku
Plants soft ass counters were not winning any rounds. What he did was protect the body really well and I respect him for that he lasted longer then most people thought. With that being said YOU GOT KNOCK DA FUCKKK OUUTTTT!!!
Adonde vas?..no corras güey!.😁
Probe plant wrong ...
This is a different level my friend!!.
Black people salty their Queen Mayweather ain't got no attention. This is what would happen if Mayweather didn't get Canelo Before his Prime 🤣🤫🖕 Y'all hate to See it 🤫🤫🤫
Canelo is destructive.
That plant is a hen
The best in the world canelo no hay boxeador en el mundo que pueda con canelo es y sera el mejor de todo Latinoamérica te quiero mucho cuídate 😘 gracias cuídate saludos desde Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇵🇷🇵🇷

Canelo vs david benivetez needs to happen soon
Viva México cabrones..
Caleb's barber lost him the fight before the fight even started😣
We love chavez sr but today we have a new undisputed king at this point the best Mexican boxer period...

Jaja
Bought fight, Caleb was holding his own and all of the sudden he seems like an amateur and folds up like a pair of Levis.
That's one bad hombre
Porque ponen musica de farruko, eso no nos representa,  f por éso 😠
Caleb will never be the same after this beating! 💓
i call that the mike tyson tuck and roll k.o
i wanna see footage of the reaction from calebs plant wife while all this was going down LOL
Ran up on him like a dog 😂
You clowns thought plant was going to win? #King Canelo
I’m glad I didn’t waste my money
Charlo brothers next
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣plant 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
QUE BUENO QUE LE DIO SU MERECIDO CANELO ALVAREZ A CALEB PLANT
They had to get David out of the way to take his belt with out a fight! Boxing and sports are so suspect now a days
We just witnessed Canelo surpass Floyd , Pacquiao An Oscar by becoming UNDISPUTED ..something none of them were able to accomplish in any weight class EVER!!! We just witnessed a historic event An Canelo setting a new bar for future generations
Arriba México
Ref: You wanna fight?! Caleb: yeah... A few seconds later: Caleb gets knocked out..
Mr. Plant you're still a soldier love and respect
Hats off to plant he’s daughter would of been proud of her dads performance against the Pound for Pound king 👑
I never want to hear Mayweather again......
Honesty canelo is so good it’s not even fun to watch his fight anymore is so one sided he need to run it back again with Triple G
Wore him down all the way to the end!!! Get fucked
I called it bruh! KO!  Caleb wasn’t on his level! Broke him down! Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Damn... I really thought Caleb would K.O. him in the 1st.
Let's not pretend like we didn't expect this
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
And people will still hate.
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!!!!
Floyd this is how true boxer fight …they don’t run around and avoid to get hit…. Canelo the beast 💪🏾💪🏾
Where the Canelo haters at?? 👀👀
Feel bad for Plant. The score was not close, at least in my book, but he held in so well. It didn't look like he was exhausted by any means, and the knockdowns really came out of nowhere, but as soon as that one clean shot got him, it was over. I think if this would've gone to decision, this would've been a big win for Plant, regardless of the result.
#Drugcheat
Canelo definitely doesn’t look invincible good win!!
Worth my money
A technical boxer/puncher. A Mexican style trainer's dream. Canelo is a monster. Let's go Mexico!! 🇲🇽
Good head movement
"Caleb is going to give canelo problems because of his style and confidence" omg canelo haters are the funniest people on the planet! 😭😂
I can't lie but I love the result of this fight and I'm not even a Mexican!
This gone make plant even stronger like the Mayweather lose for canelo I think plant will win a rematch in the future
Plant is a slicky cat..he moves like a squirrel. I rooted for him & he almost did it. Wishing him all the best
Oh shit .. that looked painful man...
U can't win against a drug cheat
#1 Undisputed baby, King Canelo. Guess the Haters went to sleep early or are in some corner crying, pinche llorones LOL
Anyone know the name of the song playing during the replays of the knockdown/tko
Well Caleb did beat Canelo in a way! He lasted well pass the 8th round and anybody that last that long in the ring with a living legend like Canelo is a beast in my opinion!
Canelo Alvarez 🥊🥊🎯💯👍
Fight the Charlo brothers
Who is next??
Viudas y malqueridas del Canelo ahora lloran, que paso amiguitos. Canelo's widows and ill-loved ones are now crying, what happened my little friends.
😳
Canelo 😎🇲🇽 Canelo 😎🌟🌟❤️
Canelo vs tyson fury next
Caleb came to fight I knew this was ganna be more difficult than Saunders! But man canelo is elite!
Shouldn't of been talking shit
Another stage dive like are you guy serious? Lol
stop comparing fighters to mayweather smh just stop
Fixed. Roid-nelo wins by fraud once again.
Canelo 😎🇲🇽 WOW He So Favorite 🌟 So Lol 👍
Que huevos de Caleb Plant mis respetos!!!!
Plant got what he asked for, a pay day and a spanking for disrespecting Mr. Alvarez mother.  Nice work Canelo!
manos de pedra !!!
Now maybe he will get the balls to fight Andrade.  Probably not, tho.  This was a boring fight.
How pretty that 🌱 is?😂😂😂canelo really did a good landscape on his azz😂😂😂
Caleb Plant dove to the ground and said "No Mas!"...
Lesson to learn never piss off canelo point made he will make you pay proven tonight
Canelo = steroids
The only one that can beat the s*** out of him is Gennady Golovkin
He still using enhancements
You can’t beat a poor mans chin…. Had us in the first half ngl
That left hook that Canelo missed before the 2nd kd could put anyone to sleep, i am glad that Plant dindn't took that one.
At this point if you have something negative to say about Canelo’s boxing you’re just a hater!
“Steroids”
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 all you plant ball sckrs where ya at?? Not only did that wanna be get knocked out Canelo beat his a*s!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HA HA HA
He nocked that white boy the fuck out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He was born in Mexico but his bloodline is Irishmen so technically 1st Irish born undisputed champion
Called it knock out by canelo took him longer then I hoped for but he still came through in the end congrats king no one can stop you now.🤴🇲🇽
Nunca pudo con ggg
I'm a life-long Canelo hater but tonight I have no choice but to accept the reality that Canelo is an all-time great. Period.
ShoTime has to show the camera angle of Jordan Plant crying! 🤫🤣🤩
Great showing by Caleb he earned a lot of people’s respect tonight, but Canelo is just Canelo I thought he was going to get him out earlier, but I knew the knockout was coming.
You had to be really high or really drunk to think that plant had a chance at all
All that shit he was talking made this beatdown so enjoyable
Canelo got all 4 belts in under 1 year. DO NOT DISRESPECT THR GOAT OF OUR GENERATION!!!
All that shit  talking beat the shit out of that boy 🤣🤣🤗🤗🤡🤡🤣😂😂🤪🤪🤪🤧😁😁😉😉😉😋🖕📴
After this fight , Canelo humbled this kid and will understand not to talk that nonsense and had a good test run 💪🏽
You wanna fight Y-yeah
Canelo did this all in 11 months 💯 he’s  literally the goat 🐐 👑🇲🇽
We knew this was going to happen

Yall gotta give credit to Plant he fought more like a man then Saunders did and he made more it competetive yall thought Canelo was just gonna walk through him like nothing yall cant lie Plant had his moments nice defense and counters and combinations it was a way more entertaining fight then the Saunders imo fans won tn and Canelo
Canal is only gotten better through his experiences in time and build up strength look at all the great fighters he has far Tennessee whiskey boy will come back learning his lessons oh fuck yeah Canelo one
Respect to Plant. This was closer than I thought. That Mayweather shoulder roll still affects Canelo. Would have loved to see this Canelo against peak Mayweather.
Good stoppage, Plant was just going to get punished the rest of the round. Respect to Plant but Canelo is King.
Only person can beat Canelo is Saitama
Andre ward getting the next ass whoop.
Plant got planted
HOOOLLYYY SHIIIII!!!
I feel bad for Caleb he was the best out of all champions canelo fought and he put a fight but it just wasn’t enough. It seemed so painful taking all those body shots 💀
That medicine is so effective all ya!
Canelo > Chavez? ….. what do y’all think?
Big money fight Mayweather!!!
Canelo will go down in history as one of the greats as he deserves….that still doesn’t excuse cherry 🍒 picking when there are better fighters at the weight classes he’s fighting in
⚠️⚠️⚠️BREAKING NEWS : WARD SEEN LEAVING THE COUNTRY ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Do you think Canelo is going to let a white boy beat him No no give me payday and your belt 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽

Come On Plant, Bruh. Even If You Know You're About To Hit The Canvas, Swing Back.
Caleb got whipped bad ... Love it  Greetings from your serbian friends worldwide  🇷🇸☦💪
Wow first time plant has ever gotten knocked out that’s a first. There’s always a first for everything
Thats a hook
Canelo took him into the late rounds for being disrespectful - and gave him a good ass whooping
Plant was doing what money did stick and move while making canelo miss almost an exact replica of that Mayweather fight ...till he got caught 😅
I toe you !
ALL THAT SHIT TALKING PLANT WAS DOING !!!!
No one hates canelo he’s just known for cherry picking …hard to claim your the best and only accept certain fights…plant is good not the best smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
canelo has so much gold he can't carry it all, he needs help
I know who can beat Canelo, Anthony Andrea
ESO !!!
theres levels to this man!
Undisputed. We witnessed a moment in history. Now beat Charlo and Andrade so all that talk can be ended. Canelo is too dominant. No1 is beating him ever again.
“Ima make him feel me”- Plant
The only boxer I think that may have a very good chance of beating Canelo Alverez at this time is Canelo Alverez.😂😂😂😂
Canelo is so great even on a slow day he comes through 🇲🇽
Still can’t believe some people thought Plant actually had a chance against Canelo lol
"Yu gonna fil sumtin diffren my fren" Caleb: 🥴🤕
The 5x champ,Viva Mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
Love it   canelo , greetings from your Serbian friends worldwide 🇷🇸☦💪
Thats the uppercut that broke Billy. Literally. 🤕✊🏾
Canelo Vs. A Sand Sack. Come on put good fighters to Canelo.
Plant 🌱 was in another dimension after the first knock out
Look Caleb was definitely making this a competitive fight it was a really tight fight people seem to forget a lot of those body shots that Canelo was landing but Caleb was showing some Mayweather style against Canelo in the end Canelo clipped Caleb in the 11th round and got the stoppage Caleb you boxed beautifully there’s still more to accomplish don’t you worry champ and Canelo Your my favorite boxer I still remember when I would watch you in Galavision and now your the first Undisputed Mexican in the weight class your in , amazing fight from both Boxers both showed up and made History
Caleb plant was fighting good, but wasn’t able to deal with Canelo’s constant pressure
Canelo cleared the division in one year. 4 fights, 4 belts. What a run.
Mike Tyson was right. You will have to go to your friends funeral after. Got damn just place bets on who ever Mike says.
Damn! I was horrified seeing Canelo run after Plant like that. It reminded me of my mom running at me with the chancla! 😂💯🇲🇽
Haters on su!<!de watch!
Nice posting highlights fast
That run across the ring though 😂 Where was plant going?
Nobody fucking with canelo!!!!
Wow he got planted on the Ground.
Plant definitely took a dive for the payday. Canelo a fraud.
Canelo is bane!!!🧟‍♂️💪
Canelo haters: he’s still ducking Charlo, Andrade, Spence, beterbeiv, AJ, Jake Paul, Obama, and goku.
CHARLO don want none!!!
