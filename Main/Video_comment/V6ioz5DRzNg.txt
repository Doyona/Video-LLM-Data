Last time the 2 played against each other. Had to feel good for  Rodgers after losing in NFC title game the year before.
Only game of the entire 2022 season that Rodgers spread the ball around to even rookie and backup players
I can't wait to see a rod again
Tampa Bay Buccaneers Go!!!!!!!❤🎉
Rodgers tore his leg Brady gone  who would have knew this was the last season for both goat qbs 🤦‍♂️
Todd Bowles did his utmost to make Tom throw short passes constantly. Stupidity at its finest!
Brady vs rodgers
As a packers fan, It felt great to beat my brothers team😊
"sure hope not"
my dad was the replacement for the guy who got fired at 24:08
Go pack Go
This is hilarious
After this game, the bucs would never be the same again

coming back to this after tom just retired 😪 gonna miss these goats playing
Was at the game and it was a good game. Wished that there was more scoring.
Coming back and seeing this to me this is a upset but both played well. Well played packers
At the end the announcer says "Two of the best teams in the NFC".  Crazy how wrong that statement ended up being.
Dang. I think if Bucs get that 2-point conversion they go on and win in overtime.
That Ending Tho... (Fitting that it would have come down to the final seconds for either of these Juggernaut QB's)
The fact that Green Bay cheated on this is terrible
Sure hop not 😂😂😂😂
6m43s  ... Why is that throw not Intentional-Grounding by TBrady ?
No one and I mean no one is talking about how the game should've ended at 14-6, that very last pass (for the touchdown) should've been called for delay of game! Don't believe me? Here's the timestamp: 9:27. The god dang ball wasn't even in the air headed towards Brady! This game will forever stand as 14-6!
Brutal to watch
Haha Tampa bay buccaneers sucks ass
Who else is here with both of these teams currently underperforming and being 3-4?
I turned down the volume and played the mario 1 theme.   😊🌱✨
Battle of the Bays.
I like Brady but that was a horrific call.  Not roughing what so ever!!!!
Epic!
I just see that Candy Ranch from Django Unchained whenever I watch NFL.
Can someone tell me what the situation of kicking 3 points at 9:59 is called? Please
Lizard stepped it up
Not a Green Bay fan and it actually made me happy to see Davante Adams go to the AFC but why would Packers let Davante go?
Did Dumbkowski change his mind about playing this season?
*Packers Defense*
Brady actually looked really good with minimal offensive threats to work with.
What was that final comment from the commentator?
That was the best game this year so far
Davante Adams 0-3
What is with these retarded packers defenders still trying to grab the ball after the play is dead?????
Where is that critical delay of the game clip gone from the highlight?????
They’re missing big plays. Pack scored then had the ball right back? What happened
"Maybe we'll see it again in the playoffs"... "I sure hope not!" lmaooooooooooooooooo
Love how Greg Olsen said at the end if he wants to see Packers and Bucs again in the playoffs I sure hope not.  Even he was bored watching this!
Darden definitely deserves more pt than Scotty...
No fumble incomplete pass in second quarter
What is up with GB defensive backs trying to punch ball out of Bucs WR arms, after the play??? 😮
Davante trade its like going from a corvette to a prius.
What a game…!
TY
Tampa had two fumbles and am I understanding this correctly as Green Bay didn't capitalize on those??  Is this not a competition?  Should the score have been so close???  And don't give me some garbage about it only being the 3rd week of the season.  I don't want to hear that garbage.  Not a legitimate excuse especially for this team.
Green Bay just got lucky we have a lot of injured players next game boutta be a dub for the bucs BUCS all the way baby see y’all at the Super Bowl
Note to YouTube and Advertisers, Stop interrupting the highlights with forced commercials. It's annoying. I, now, make an effort to deliberately AVOID BUYING ANY PRODUCT on said interruptions. Stop it.
"maybe we'll see it again in the playoffs"  "I SURE HOPE NOT"  lol
lefluer is such a lousy  adjustment coach 7 points second half vikes 3 points second half bears and no points second half buccaneers
0:18 would have actually been an incredible defensive move if he hadnt just touched him.
Fire whoever edited this please
“Maybe we’ll see them in the playoffs..” “Sure Hope Not” 😂😂
Packer's 1st touchdown was an illegal pick play. The wide receiver immediately ran to start blocking the corner back before the ball was thrown and made contact before the ball was thrown. Should have been a flag and no touchdown
Tom Brady not a goat
I'm putting this on any NFL or College football reference I can Gary Danielson of CBS Sports is an idiot he doesn't know what he's talking about or he has Alzheimer's he needs to retire
I SURE HOPE NOT
That blindside hit from Douglas to Gage Jr was brutal. That should’ve been a personal foul.
20 ppg is important son, because no team has made to the Super Bowl in the modern era averaging below 20 pts the whole season.
it still shocks me neither team has yet to average 20 points/game through 3 weeks. In fact there is a record number of teams below 20 ppg at this point in the season. An alltime high for the league.
I expected a QB game with high scoring, ended up being a defense game. Loved it!
#lilwayneout 🔥🔥👈🏿👈🏿
let`s wait for the winter playoff rematch in january 2023
I feel like Super Bowl came early 🎉😊
Araon double R Rogers
I only wish Rodgers would be more like Brady and sacrifice some $$ in order to have a better supporting cast. That choice by Brady in his career is vastly underrated. With doing that, sacrificing his paycheck to win superbowls, he created a far, far higher net worth both in the short, and long run
Green Bay Defense an Offense go hard
rodgers on fire
What a trash start buccs next time tho
The possible last headbutting of two GOATS
Aaron tiene la receta sobre Tom
Two goats go head to head
Damn just when you want Super Brady to win he chokes
I bet Arron likes throwing to the number 87 again…. If you know you know 💕
That 2 minute drill is what brady came out of retirement for . He loves that feeling
Randall cobb is stepping up for arod
Por favor, algum brazuka que entenda sobre essa bagaça, para me explicar?? Que esporte mais confuso, gente.... 😂😂
these Bucs wrs wearing butter gloves fr
Go Packers 💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💚💛💛💚💚💛💛💚💚
Vote to legalize in cali !!
Always good to see GB defense allow only 12 points off Brady. Will be interesting to see the season play out as the competition seems more level this year. Even the dolphins look decent lol.
🏈 ,🇺🇲
The refs weren't able to bail out Brady this time, even though they tried. Ya love to see it. Nice win, Green Bay.
Should have been 21-12 at the least
Brady doesn’t activate until the last possession 🐐
"Hard fought" 😆 them people know this game was already planned before it happened
Rodgers > Brady
Yes that’s A rod! The best to ever throw the ball!!!
almost there to win
2020 NFC Championship rematch
PISSED THAT ME BUCCANEERS LOST
Damn really close game hopefully we can bounce back against the chiefs next week gonna be tough and LETS GO BUCS
"maybe its the last time or maybe we'll see it again in the playoffs."  "sure hope not"       ..wait what u mean by that my guy??   (0_o)
Brandy is always always looking for A New Yellow Flag ????
What is with All The other things just keep the ball and chain moving up and down pointing acting like it's a Big Deal?????
Brady Vs Rogers always snaps
Weird how we aren’t talking about how open Randell Cobb was getting
I think Rodgers noticed that Brady was favoring throwing it to the right side of the endzone.
Os ataques não fizeram nada.
The packers defense and special teams looked great. Wait, what?
To me, this is the game the Packers SHOULD have played last year against SF in the playoffs. Opportunistic, quick start...disheartening fumble...but stout play by the defense and special teams to bring home the victory.
The image is too offensive
It's was awesome watching Brady play with my cheese heads 😀  🧡
Number 12 vs  Number  12!! :-)
Let's go packers
How did we win this game…
Dont go  practice , help evacuate people
Thought this was Madden 23 with so many fumbles
everybody’s talking about his great the qb play was, I’m wondering why there were so many fumbles
Mannnn people say cobb is washed but he looks fresh to me. And he’s so savy. Packers offense has been missing that someone so good at splitting their guy and the safety over the top for a huge gain over the middle like cobb does consistently. It’s too bad he doesn’t have breakaway speed or else so many of those would be touchdowns
lmao brady is trash without a top WR
Whoever is doing the dtv commercials is very talented! I usually skip em, but not these!
After Lazards big 4 Q catch....run the ball. That would have killed TB time outs and taken 20 of 40 sec off the clock...very bad clock management .
WHEWWWW That was a rough one     Congrats GB. 👍 🏈 🧀 The turnovers in this game made this one an anxiety fest 😆 LOL
Aaron Rogers so proud of you beating that ugly mouthed ego ,self absorbed idiot!
Bucs TD was illegal. Snap came after play clock was :00. But then if you removed all the ILLEGAL from Brady's career, he might have just 1 SB.
The bucs had no highlights or what??
this is why i laugh at modern quarterbacking in the nfl. a 14-12 game and commenters on here are talking more about the quarterbacks than the defenses. the quarterbacks of today, especialling tom crybrady could not have played in any other era. what would Joe Montana have done if defenses were not allowed to look at him let alone tackle him? especially if defensive backs couldnt touch Jerry Rice like they could when the nfl actually played football? give me a break about today's quarterbacks.  when you are treated like fragile glass and you put up numbers its not impressive.
Meaningless win for Packers, of anything it shows how dangerous the Bucs are when healthy.
Brady went down like a feather on that first sack. All it took was a pat on the back
Passing of the guard...no pun intended.   Aaron Rodgers just took the mantle.
Bucs win if one of those fumbles converts to a field goal, heartbreaking 😭
0:18 wtf lol
These tight sheer shorts are too far. They look disgusting. And someone’s helmet says choose love? I think that needs to be taken off like these animals are so criminal off the field they can’t figure out how to make this disgusting sport watchable?
Too many turnovers/non conversions by tb, congrats gb this was a gg
Aaron Rodgers finally got one on Tom Brady. I hope Tom gave his team an earful, this is totally unacceptable.
Sure hope not 😂 wtf
I’ll be honest as a packers fan. There’s no way I saw us winning this game
The touchdown shouldn't have counted.. the clock was clearly at :00 which made the Packers put the referees on notice the second time.. mfs tried to cheat us..
Go Pack Go
Really glad Rodgers seems to have found a new go-to. So sick of fellow fans saying "what does he have??" all off season. I'm excited to see if Doubs instantly turns to a dynamic player in the league! Tonyan was utilized alot too, offenses get scary when a TE is a threat. I love both RB's but I want that Rodgers air show to continue until he retires
Wonder how this game would be different if it were played 4 days later (on the 29th) in the same stadium
Sighs. Brate is so underutilized it's a shame
Buccaneers suck. Im a big fan of them but this game shows they arent capable of facing off the best offensive lines in the league unless they make some needed improvements. The raw amount of interceptions and fumbled againts them was insane.
Pretty remarkable pass interference xD
As a packers fan, I did not think the defense would hold up in the 4th. We got lucky
That wasn't ugly?
if u guys look clearly doubs was open last second as rodgers threw it to jones for the 3rd down fumble. Just imagine it would of been a whole new difference of a second half for the packers. Packers were getting ball back second half too👀
Driver,Jennings,Jordy,devante,doubs
Somehow you make time stop and fly all at the same time.
3:45 they got linemen dropping in coverage now?
The Pack is back.
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂.... Bucs lost...... #gopackers #whodat ⚜️
Damn TB should have won!
Jesus is Lord Amen
Jesus Loves everybody Amen
Considering how bad Buccs wanted to loose, they kinda deserved it
There were no highlights from the Bucs. Horrible all the way around
Watching the elder QBs is so boring.  its only fun when they get all upset everytime a defending player bumps into them.
Bucs defense is top tier
Superbowl prediction. Superbowl will be future hall of famer Pat Mahomes vs Aaron Rogers.
Just like l said GB is the better team. Good game anyway
@5:03 Aaron Rogers ball should have been out, arrogance set in, get that ball out
One thing about Brady.   He has to have a heart like  Rocky a fiction character.
Fans the death metal hardcore https://youtube.com/channel/UCAwzrGzqAPMC_NhPeZaQX8w
Brady is a shell of his former self and needs to retire immediately with body and dignity still intact and save his marriage while he still can.

Perriman is absolute garbage.
Proverbs 14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.
yeah buccaneers girls ... unite!! lol
There is no female form of buccaneers....  the girls they call buccaneers girls. .Whoohoo! go buccaneers girls!!
actually the correct term is buccaneer's girls. lol
Tampa Bay need to call AB 📞  back maan
Battle of the Bays! Advantage: Packers.
Brady is as great as any other good QB with surrounding team.
The Packers didn’t win that game. The Bucks lost it!
Good games for both teams by the Green Bay Packers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers!!!
Packers d is awful they tried there best to let old ass Brady back in the game.
let me educate u sports fans,every sunday the worst teams in footballwith little time left go down the field,WHY, cuz of the prevent defence,now the GB DEFENCE HELD BRADY TO 2 FGS UP TOO THE LAST 3 MINS OF PLAY, SO WHY DID THEY GO INTO THE PREVENT,ALL GAME WHAT THEY WHERE DOING WAS WORKING AND THATS HOW BRADY GOT DOWN FIELD BY A PREVENT, NEVER CHANGE WHATS WORKNG THEY WHERE PRESSURING BRADY ALL DAY AND NO TDS!!
on a scale of 10,  bucs offense = 0, bucs defence -10
Arrogant Rodgers sticks it to the Goat!
Enough commercials JFC
Tampa need new wrs
Cheers to these middle-aged men throwing DARTS!
Romeo Doubs and Quay Walker are stars in the making
Check out that pass Rogers to Cobb, two bucks were there, but Devon white ran behind his teammate and the guy ran inside untouched, why did white move behind his own guy so Cobb cuts in the middle for a big gain. ?
I'm an old Boston guy, watching NFL since 1965, I've watched Brady's whole trajectory from begining to the stupid move of letting him go, something's not right, not physically, he seems lethargic a bit, his demeanor has changed, I think Giselle is in his mind and he's doubting himself, he didn't have a lot to work with but I see something missing, his joy of playing football seems questionable. Idk, I hope he gets his mojo back.
Is it me or does Brady look kinda deflated?
Some of the BUCS WR route running looks just outright lazy
Bucs pack 🚬🚬🚬💨💨💨
Those bucks receivers love to fumble
I like how Brady falls to the ground every time he’s about to get sack Cleo Mack gave him hell.. Go eagles
What a heart warming game
Packers out played the Bucs period. Packers down 2 starting WRs and a pro bowl CB. don’t need the injury excuses
Packers, no adjustment at the half, 0 points thereafter. Same ol' Pack. But it's a win. The thing is, you don't want the Pack to play the post season at Lambeau. That weather doesn't do them any good. So hopefully they are 10-7, 11-6, 12-5 this year.
We would’ve easily won with Mike Evans
Can you bring my flowers please
I not playing with these people
Make more 😍🤩😍
Ryan: Wow 87: No ;p
For those who watched the whole game, did anyone else notice Gary getting held like 75% of the time? Or were my eyes deceiving me?
10:00 💀bro
Imagine if nobody was hurt for both teams. This game would’ve been insane.
if you watched the end of this game and still think referees don’t fix games, you just don’t wanna come to terms with the truth. I’ve never seen the refs be more obvious with trying to force an outcome. they wanted the bucs to win so badly that they weren’t even sneaky about it. time to wake up, guys.
老汉和龙哥的对战，看一场少一场。
that DPI shouldn't have been called at the end of the game, brate initiated contact and pushes off, when (if) amos grabbed brate, it was in retaliation and barely grabbed him at all, at least from the POV they gave us
Good to see Brady act like a baby..refs were trying hard to make him win ..hahaha
No Mike Evans, no Gronk, no Antonio Brown?
1:15 holy sh*t that throw is elite
As a Bucs fan, I always said that Brady should have quit after last season - go out with the NFL passing record, NFC division champs, and narrow loss to the Super Bowl champ Rams. BUT, OH NO - pride got the best of Brady, trying to get that "one last ring". Now, his offense can't ring up more than ONE touchdown a game. PATHETIC - but very much like other QB's who "stayed too long".
As a Bucs Brady fan, dnt really mind they lost given their receivers injured. Def r ready to fight in playoffs n offense shud b ready by then if injuries are managed. Hav always respected Rogers skills evn tho ppl dnt like him but he's always is in the running for Mvps n a threat in playoffs. Bucs with Brady hav taught me to accept the tough loses in season games and watch them battle teams out of the playoffs.
Turnovers killed the bucs
You mean- Brady lost??? WHAT A CRYIN SHAME...
0:57 beehive
This is basically what Tom would look like if he played for the Jets or Jaguars his whole career Lmao
That delay of game was inexcusable!
“I sure hope not.” 😂
Every superhero has their villain.
Fumbles of many!
“I hope not”
green bay was bussin ngl
Good game
Aaron Rodgers is the best
Man don't need Adams
#fumblecity LMAO
I think this game settles the GOAT debate. Rodgers outplayed Brady with rookie receivers against a much better defense.
2 remarkable qbs
Take that. Brady.
GOPACKGO!!!! THANK YOU DEFENSE !!!! 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
The cooing innocent positionally concentrate because pine immunologically retire anenst a judicious barge. hungry, crabby yard
My Packers pulled it off!! But damn that felt like a NFC Championship game right there 💯🔥💯🔥
Rodgers #12 my Idol / Brady #12 is my Idol
It's a sight for sore eyes to see Brady walking off the field with that look on his long face like somebody smeared his face in a big juicy pile of bullshit, I absolutely bust out laughing so dam bad that I can almost puke! Damn I just love it when boy wonder loses.
F Fun fact ; you can tell who won the game just by the video thumbnail. Whichever team has the possession (the ball) in the vid thumbnail is the team that won.. that’s true with any highlights vid the NFL uploa
Should of had pass inereference on gb on the 2 pt conversation
The Packers defense answered a lot of questions with the win yesterday. Not too often a team holds Tom Brady to 12 points. Yesterday was a big step forward.
Jumbotron
Tip of the hat to the rookie doubs, it's nice to see a speedy WR in the lineup
So it took all 3 quarters and all of the 4th for Tampa Bay to put a normal Offensive drive together…? Just to finally get a touchdown though yet fail the 2 point conversion.. And yet it was Rodgers picking apart the Tampa D.. How is it these big anticipated match ups always seem to flip the statistical script.. Interesting:
Rodgers really wanted to win the Geezer Bowl. If he played with this much heart every game they'd be SB bound.
The defenses were both amazing
These Bucs games are putting me to sleep. litterally. EXCEPT THE 4TH QUARTERS THO THOSE YOU WANNA WATCH
So what happened to the delay of game call on Brady🤦🏾‍♂️ The score should have literally been 14-6.
So , the crucial delay of game is not in ? Come on nfl ….
What’s up with the defenders trying to punch out the ball after the play has ended in the first couple of clips?
I believe the only reason Tom Brady is still playing is to rack up more yards and TD‘a to ensure no one can break his records. That’s how competitive he is.
"Sure hope not."!
🏉
Should have got that extra point dude smh
If the bucs receivers don't fumble Brady wins this game easily and if he had Godwin or Evans Brady totally wins
The receivers for Tampa Bay need to learn to hold on to a ball maybe they could borrow some stickem from Fred bullittnikoff
Aaron the best to do it
Defense wasn’t to bad
That Bad Man He Is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I sure hope not" is hilarious
Forgot to show all the refs for the packers highlights. Them the real mvp.
As a packers fan, I was very surprised by Rodgers being able to score 2 tuds and the defense only giving up 12 pts, two kicks and one tud from TB12. Very surprising game.
ffs
How tf did tb lose
This was a battle of giants. Excellent game excellent performances from both defenses. Go pack!
I live in Boston and the Patriots are finished cause of their GM..This was a good game man!!
Да ладно, старичок сделал всё что мог
🔥🔥🔥
To sum it all up in a nutshell without the details: THE GREENBAY PACKERS DEFEATED THE BUCCANEERS IN GAME 3 WHILE BOTH TEAMS HAD KEY WRs OUT!!!!! NO PASSES GIVEN.
Good try Brady hes probably still crying 😭😭😭💯 like when he with new England cry baby like in new England.  Good win for arone Rogers good defense
Rigged
Not gone lie the Packers second should had been called back that was a delay of game
The last two of there kind going at it for probrably the last time unless they meet in the playoffs👍🏾
It was nice to see Rodgers come out on top of Brady.
Even with all Brady's weapons being out it still seemed like he had guys running wide open multiple times and it seemed Rodgers hardly had any guys run wide open
How do you know the bucs ain't good this year... Beating the saints and losing to the Packers
GoPackGo
The Tampa bay succaneers 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Go pack go!!
Dang that happened, good win Cheese head😉
It was very disappointing at the end of the game that Brady didn't get the play off in time. I think he would have had a very good chance to win the game. The more I watch Aaron Rogers the more I dislike the guy.
What a game
10 +
Love seeing the Toddler Tom Brady get his Ass whipped by another team, Not the Goat everyone think he is. Good Game Packers.
Go Pack Go
Rodgers kryptonite is heat, humidity, and the Bucs defense. Good to see the defense came to play. Go Pack Go.
Then there's the part where they need to beat a playoff-caliber team in the post-season...
Davante: 👁️👄👁️
The Senior Citizens Bowl
Could GB finally have a defence good enough to go all the way? It's been their weakness for ages.
Why did it take Brady until 1:00 left in the 4th quarter to realize that his regular receivers weren't playing and that Gronk retired? You could see the fear in Aaron's eyes as Tom finally marched his troops to the goal - oh no, not again, damn!
Does the NFL still stream the "Coach's Film?"
Man If Our Offense Didnt Fall Asleep Second Half This Wouldve Been A Blowout , Thank God Defense Showed Up Tho !! #gopackgo
Happy to see cole beasley play again 😃
Hate I couldn't catch this game. Ugh...😒 ty for the highlights though. Looked exciting to say the least.
It really shines on Bradys and Rodgers greatness how neither have any real star Wide outs but still put together a decent game.
But the Bucs are still a better team they beat the saints 20-10
The Buccaneers should have won I still think they would have won any other day
TB'N Bucs handicapped despite the L.  Wouldn't bet against TB come post seaseon.
Bucs 2 fumbles cost the game
Wow.  What a defense game from both teams!!   Anyone knows why Falcons lose Gage this offseason? I hate to see he's leaving
When did TB rename all of their receivers to surname 'Gage'?
The Packers didn't score on their last 9 drives and still won in Tampa..
The scripting and acting performances in this game were outstanding. I legit thought this was a real game. Finally. This was pure WWE entertainment but on a whole entire level. Even the defenses made this game excitable. Two of the all-time best, elite actors in Rodgers and Brady. This movie...err...I mean "game" surely lived up to the hype. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time just shuttering with anxiety with the "what-will-happen-next" feels.
Wanna see how to piss off GB fans: when was the last time arod won a SB? Yep 2011 and ever since just 11 yrs of Stat padding and for what an 11-10 post season record what a joke
pass interference on final play but whatever lol
FGB
Green Bay SUCKS !!  🖕🏽 Rogers ..their never gonna get a ring ! EVER 🤣🤣🤣
I hope Tom Brady's able to get his personal life in order because obviously the season's going to go nowhere for him if he can't get his mind right.
Excellent defense against Brady, fantastic offense cheesehead performance. They controlled the game, even in adversity against the G.O.A.T. Tom Brady.
It wasn`t pretty but, it`s a W, we now know what kind defense both teams have, now they both have to fix their offence.
That delay of game on the 2 point conversion took my soul.
Go pack!
What a game….sloppy …but amazing
Pretty remarkable what both QBs did with rather horrendous pass-catching options vs really good defenses.
Packers fan here. No hate towards any team except da bears. Just wanted to say that this game came down to the defenses. Beautiful game between these two defenses and always a treat to see Brady vs Rodgers. Thanks for the good game 😁
What is the NFL doing, how is this game not in the SNF slot. Two of the greatest meeting for probably the last regular season game. Instead they put Broncos v 49ers?
Time management is the difference and why Brady won all of those Super Bowls in New England. It's on Brady but also on Todd Bowles. Belichick wouldn't have never let that happen.
Green Bay Defense Looks unreal.
Aikman & Joe not calling the game of the week is so weird Man
As a PACKER fan i knew it wouldn't be easy. I give credit too both teams. Go Pack Go
0:09 to early to punch the ball lol also 0:18
TB still has his rockets on. He throws the ball so good and decodes very well. At the other hand we have another goat named Aaron Rodgers. He’s better qb than TB at the moment. I hope they’ll meet again at playoffs.
and everyone was doubting the packers too lmao
GO PACK GO!! 💚💛
Jogaço!
packers 🧀💪🏿
Don’t wanna hear the WR injury excuse. Rogers is down Watkins and Christian Watson on a already pretty thin receiving core. Great game by the most talented qb of all time and the greatest qb of all time.
Lets goo packers
WAshed up old brady should go back on vacation...These other teams arent playing this year
Go Rodgers, go Green Bay!
Packers didn't win this game, the buccaneers lost it.
Sorry Tommy.
without GB fumble at like the 2/3 yardline the game is over early,but its brady if something dosent go his way the refs step in and help him!! by the way there was 2 delay of games going for the 2point,like a said refs stepping in!!!
Expect the unexpected GO PACK GO!!!
This game felt like a classic from the whistle.
both teams had a depleted receiving corps but good defenses. AR-12 and TB-12 did a good job despite their team's bad rosters
Why is nobody talking about the clock running out in tampas touchdown 😒
game was epic until that delay of game which prevented us from seeing an epic OT
They will meet again healthy
The drama 😅
Damn near felt like a repeat of their NFC championship game with the amount of holding the refs were letting the Bucs defense do. Then you had the b.s. holding call against the Packers and that b.s. running into the kicker call. And the refs really didn't want to call that delay of game. Besides all that, good job to the Packers defense. GB needs to find more variety of run plays to get the running game going more. Having Dillon run down the middle every time is not going to cut it and with the lack of WRs they need a great run game
Well played to both.
Brady almost went 3-0 with only 3 touch downs RFLMAO
Bucs defense and Tom Brady tried their best to win this game, meanwhile Bucs offense tried their best to stop them.
W Packers
Anyone else think that second packers TD looked like a delay of game?  I’m not sure they beat the play clock on the snap. That could have changed the entire outcome.
If Bucs offense was a lot more healthier than they are right now, they may have blown out the Packers. Bucs defense is probably the best in the league now.
Bruh the defence on both sides were unbelievable
Watch out for Doubs
2 fumbles cost the game
Interesting, bucs lost in a bad handling of the ball, without Godwin, j. Jones and Evans but still a close game.  Nice game tho...
Amazing how a guy can make a catch, run out, then proceed to strut and dance for an additional 15 yards, realize he's a buffoon and have to sprint back to the line because the offense is setting up while he's showboating lol
love watching these two goats playing
I used to like Greg Olsen last year despite the fact he’s a former bear—this year he’s become absolutely unbearable
I’m mad the buccaneers lost
There should be a Hall of Elite and a Hall of Good.....1 ain't Elite and 1 should be Hall of Cheat.
Brady soft ass...falling down.  Cold sucker.
Just when I was gonna say perriman can hold on to the ball now he fumbles guess we not miss nothing in Baltimore 🤣🤣🤣
Packers defense came to play and matched the intensity of the Bucs D. Jones fumble and the punt return called back those 2 plays went the other way this game would've been a blowout...GO PACK
So lucky Mike wasn't in the game
what was #29 doing at 0:09 smacking the ball after the completion. then did it again on the next play at 0:19  like i get you are mad but thats so immature
Was it me, or did playoff Lenard have a shoot at the tipped ball
HOW ABOUT THEM PACKERS BABY!!! LEEETTTSSSGOOOO 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
Russell Gage for sure earned a lot of trust from Brady by stepping up the whole game and on the last drive to score the touchdown. Showed a lot of fight out there
This week on NFL news shows. 'Well, Rodgers was pretty bad, he obviously hates his team mates, also, dont forget he went on Joe Rogan, so he obviously hates America.. Brady hasnt been on that show, so you know... Rodgers is a horrible person. '
Always a pleasure watching 2 legend QBs matchup 😎🔥
they was on gage jr top the whole game
We know how elite the Bucs D was. But holy crap was that packers d showing they’re just as great
Brady trying to cheat at the end there
In spite of the typical-standardized-New-Ugly-Paper-Champion style cheating (3rd quarter Dumb Bratty's team is behind as usual so - no holding calls on his offensive line, no OPI on his targets, and no DPI on his teams defense; coupled with a variety of phantom calls) AND THEY STILL CAN'T GET IT DONE AGAINST THE REAL GREATEST QB OF ALL TIME, with is aged WR, shaky young WR, ROOKIE WR with barely any game time with, and banged up TE (along with altered OL).  DANNNG.
2 GOATS still playing at a high level.
That ending was hilarious   “Maybe we’ll see it again in the playoffs.”  “I sure hope not.”
Pack  go 💚💚💚🙏🙏🙏👍😂
This game reminds me of the NFC championship game.. both defenses were playing good.. packers finally came out on top 😢
Is there a reason that the thumbnail always shows the winning team as the focus?  Absolutely kills this channel for me.  Would love to know the reasoning behind that choice.  Does anyone else have a problem with that?
Refs really tried given brady every chance to stay in this game
Turn covers galore
lmfao. Love to see Brady lose. hahahaha
Not only did the BUCS loose today, but next time they play they have to face the chiefs that will be another loss.
If the Bucs weren’t playing with a practice squad offense we would’ve won. GB had players out too but not to the level we did. We will see them again.
Our defense was absolutely stunning. #GoPackGo
Bucs offense shot themselves in the foot like 10 times lol. Bucs defense is legit, they will be dangerous if/when offense gets healthy.
GOOOO PACCCK GOOOO!!!
The refs were trying to hand the bucs the game but they sold it 2 PT conversion
Brady fell down on purpose after escaping from the first sack.
good to see Rashad Perryman not on injured reserve.  With Baltimore he could never stay healthy.
Great game no doubt... but why do we always see flags when brady is driving for the comeback... it happens all the time...great game.
Green Bays defense won them this game. The 2nd half was just not good at all offensively. Not only because Tampa Bay adjusted their defense but no adaptation to the situation for the Packers on offense to change how they moved the ball. And leaving 7 points on the table from the fumble near the end zone didn't help either. Gotta get better on that. But what a win
Rogers:  "I want Randall Cobb back!" Packer Fans:  "Good call!"
Go Jets😔
The QBs in this game have a combined age older than Joe Biden
Good game. Way too many turnovers though on both sides. Had TB not turned the ball over, they would have had a better chance.  Congrats to GB! We may be looking at a possible playoff match up.
They will meet again in the playoffs for a grand finale between these 2 legendary QBs
Tampas offense were just fumbling on every play
gotta blame arod himself for the int
brady hands down the biggest fraud in sports history
Brady and Rodgers looking like grumpy old men 3 at the end of the game.
I find it hilarious that the nfl tries to make Aaron Rodgers look like a frail old man and they make Brady’s little character look like a Tren taking monster that curls 150lb dumbbells
Brady squeaked by the 1st 2 games but not today!  Well done Packers!  Merica's Team Since 1919 🇺🇸
didnt score in the 2nd half is a problem, hope our offense could be more consistent
Бл...такой матч заспойлерили нафига спрашивается...а так хотелось посмотреть и кайфонуть самый крутой поединок тура так нет обломали...за это антилайк..!
💚💛
Aaayahuasca Rogers
Defences are incredible for both teams. And the heat they were playing in makes it more impressive.
That’s funny I bet the real colors of Tom Brady came out, they always try to make it appear he’s a caring loving person but the real Tom Brady is a selfish greedy evil person by the way Americans catholics ARE NOT TRUE BIBLICAL CHRISTIANS  catholicism is a very evil person
Those penalties and fumbles cost the Bucs
Great game fellaz
Awesome game. Thanks for sharing.  Have a great weekend. 👍
Better to lose in Sep then to get KO in Jan.
The fact qbs this old is playing this good is crazy to me
*Rodgers >>>* little Shady brady the Big Cheater
Defense of both teams played well.  Receivers of Tampa had two costly fumbles.
Not a fan of either team but glad green bay won. 🤔
10:22 Man, Brady looks so unhappy and tired.
Rodgers was absolutely magnificent in this game. His awareness and accuracy in the first half was unreal 14/15. He played like he had a point to prove
Mit diesem guten Spiel von Green Bay Packers , habe nicht gerechnet  .
Love the end when he says "sure hope not "must be a packer fan cuz they don't want to play the bucs again!!!!🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
Both teams had a good start. It was zero zero when the game started.
Who would've thought that with 2mins left to go in the 2nd and the ball in GB hands on Tampa's 5... they wouldn't score again all game. Rodgers arse falls out against Brady. Great Defense and win though.
battle of the bums and gb wins against a top 5 d with nobody
Too much fumbling
Go Pack go!!!🏈
1:57 is that the same play from SB game Pats vs Seahawks? that got intercepted by Malcom..
0:19 what is number 29 doing?? lol
Kudos to the editor. Good edit.
Fitting that A Lazard caught the final kick. Dude had an amazing game.
Today the jaguars scored more points than the buccaneers, packers and 49ers combined
Let's make it a regular to comment the ads so in a few years we can recall what was hot "no cap just squeeze"
Cowboys baby. This is our year. Lmao jk
As a fan of florescent flip flops, I floss with dirty G strings. Hamburger.
As a Madden Mobile elite player, I know full well how hard it is to win with 60 rated WRs instead of 90s. Brady will bounce back once his 90s are back.
Brady had no weapons. With the injuries and suspensions, they might need to sign someone if they are going to make it back to the Super Bowl.
You can really tell these two are exceptional passers.
Aaron Rodgers is officially the new NFL GOAT!
Great performance guys , we really won by more than that we just slipped up . All good tho , defense got our back !!
That was a good game !!!
They didn't get the win. But Brady in the 2 min off will always be my favorite sports moment. So glad he's still playing.
Russell Gage played his ass off!!!
GPG!
if u look at the tumb nail It literally shows everytime what team wins
"Maybe we ll see them in thr playoffs"  "sure hope not!" what kinda commentator is so blatantly biased and still gets commentate? oh wait, ofcourse. what a loser!
Rodgers is the only one who can beat Brady 🤔
WTF
The Bucs just look disoriented
Brady put his team in position to win but the offence sucked
I couldn’t watch the game so thanks for the 10 minute version😁👍
Damn gud game
Enjoy this victory Aaron Rogers and Green Bay, Tampa will get their injured players back.  Next time Tampa will win.
Wow I read through most comments and no hate at all. Pure praise to both quarter backs. This game was all about defense!! Quarter backs had to work with what they had
Come on Tampa offense let's go Tom we can make it work
I have to admit, that was a good game.
Crazy how no one is mentioning how depleted the bucs offensive line and receivers are. Had the team been healthy this game probably would have ended very differently.
On the first two plays of watching this, why is green bay so mad? 😂 lol trying to punch and smack the ball away?
Brady about to retire mid season if Bucs are playing like this on Offence......they look bad as the receivers can't separate or do anything....the offensive play calling is also questionable....Byron needs to scheme better as the receivers can't separate. Rams are still the best team in NFC just because of the talent they got...Bucs will go one and out in the playoffs if they continue to play like this on Offence
Packers should have won by 20 points instead, they almost went to overtime!
buccs have  so many players hurt  only reason   green b bay could win
great defensive battle. Goat looked off today
Better get going if you want to compete with the AFC
Rodgers and Green Bay 💪
Those WR really let there QBs down today
As a Floridian whose favorite teams are Dolphins and Buccanneers (AFC & NFC favorites) I'm both excited and disappointed from the matches today. Dolphins overcame that Bills that not many were expecting, and Tua has been performing very well these first three games. Bucs honestly would've won this game had Mike Evans not had been suspended for that fight from last game. But with all that being said, I feel this will be the last time we see Brady vs Rodgers (at least as a Buc). I don't see Brady going to Miami next season as was rumored, but I actually think he's going to go over to the 49'ers given Lance's injury and not wanting to stick with Garoppolo. I hope I'm wrong but I feel this is going to be the course if this season continues to follow the trajectory that has started with this current season.
Bucs should’ve won this game
Great true story..book title-"Cowboy Mafia "🌿..
I enjoy knowing who's going to win the game by which team has the ball in the thumbnail.  Way to waste our time NFL editors.
Don't believe THE HYPE...2PT CONVERSION ATTEMPT which failed only exciting part of the game
Should have told Rodgers it was NFC Championship,would have been over quick.
Where is Bucaneers running game?
Enjoy the games. DONT GAMBLE
Thank you!
When Aaron Jones fumbled I was so heated. Then I saw who laid him out and was like ," that was a good play". Vita Vea is goon. Hats off to the BUCS squad I know  we squeaked by this time.
Wish we had Adam's...I hope the young wr can make some plays
This low-scoring weekend in NFL is the true comedy... American football is about scoring, so if you can't score one f**king TD in a quater - go to MLB for running with fat, bearded men in the dust for the fun!
It all came down to a two point conversion what more can I say about this game, The Packers did good today on 3rd downs.
How was this game not on Sunday night??
Goodell ordered the refs to give the baby another win but couldn't pull it off,perhaps the refs have integrity now?
Two of my favorite QB's in action. I have so much respect for both of them. Honestly really cool to watch. I didn't want either team to lose lol.
Girls DON'T play football
Game of the year. That's who Aaron Roger's is.
I just hope one more ring for Rodgers , sucha great qb deserves more. Great game btw
The one place on the internet where we're SUPPOSE to trash talk and y'all wanna be all respectful 🤦‍♂️
What a game!!1
10:19 daaaaaaaaaaaaang! huge BM!!!
I thought the GOAT didn't need pro bowl teammates to win 🤔
I've yet to see the Packers have a good Halftime adjustment in 3 Year's, is it the Coach, the Quarterback or Both? This doesn't make any Sense to me.
Please stop giving away the result with the thumbnail, NFL! You never used to do this.
Two appex predator quarterbacks...
funny how 9 of 10 predictions had the Bucs.   This was Saturday, AFTER  the Injury reports, so no excuses about Brady didn't have X &Y.   We didn't have Watson and Watkins who were responsible for most of our Week 2 offense.   Also no all world Jaire and only 50% all world Bakhtiari. Also we survived 2 horrible calls go against us, including the running into the kicker where our guy was thrown onto their kicker.
No Comment: Jesus is Lord ✝️🙏🕊⏰🧂🧊🧂🥰
Nice game buccs
And to think Packers wanted to move forward with Jordan Love over this guy 😂
Rodgers arm is crazy
Aaron Rodgers is a baller
Romeo Doubs breakout party!!
not many undefeated teams left this season
Some games end up being dissapointing, but this one def lived up to the Brady vs Rodgers hype
Rodgers is such a better QB then that c*nt brady
Should have had Brady’s 15 yard run even though it was called back.
The guy editing this video was probably drunk. A lot of strange developments from approx 7th minute onwards
Great game
Ask for a flag in the 2 point conversion... That's the mark of tom lady and his teams, can't win fair, so seek the help of refs, like always...
That bucs offense is just making too many mustakes.
As a Packers fan after those two first drives I was thinking "finally we get to absolutely run them over" and while I don't think it's that simple (but it sure seems to happen every time) the offense completely disappears after a big unfortunate mistake being the Jones goalline fumble. You can't tell me The Bucs defense just went god mode and locked the whole offense down. MLF and Rodgers have got to respond much much better. If not for Tampa missing those 3 monster receivers and fumbling 2 scoring drives away we lose horribly. Sure we had no Jaire and Watson but that is no where near the losses that Tampa had for this matchup. Solids defenses but especially from GB definitely worried about the offense going forward...
Rodgers need a senzu bean 🫘
Damm Packers dunked on bucs
dbs cant tackle 💀💀
what is a  pity
What a day for fumbles.
Tom Brady seems like he could play forever its crazy .
Tom can still play this game. Remarkable.
Very exciting game by two really good teams that look to be equal. Clean football as well by both squads. These two teams are tough to beat for sure.
Go Pack Go👍👍👍👍👍
How did a Tom Brady-Aaron Rodgers game end up being 14-6 with under a minute to go?
Can teams please stop playing soooo soft on last drives of games?
Good.
Yes AROD let’s go finally got a W against Brady first time Seen since I was still a kid in 2014 an 8 years later finally gets it done it wasn’t pretty but at least he got the W in Tampa
Never Underestimate The Almighty GreenBay Packers
Bucs offense isn't working. Injuries are not the only problem.
******GARBAGE******
The Green Bay Packers are 2-1🟢🟡⚪️🧀 Week 4 vs Patriots
How many tablets did Brady beat on today??!!🤣🤣🤣
Brady had no weapons during this match-up. Wait until evans and godwin and julio are good to go
It’s crazy how many targets Brady has with name value alone like beasly, Rudolph, Julio, Evens, Godwin, Gronk, like oh my goodness
Okay, where was Brady’s amazing duck move, run, and slide??
why do the bears never have a good QB
Notice how different this game goes when the packers actually have a defense opposed to last time we played them. Packers defense was ready to play all day and while the offense was slow in the second half, we were able to do just enough and it looks like the Rodgers-Doubs in game connection is coming alive, im excited
I can see Shannon coming on the show and blasting TB already lol
Really good Game from both. With that lineup brady did pretty good
I love my 🧀 HEAD'S
LETS GO GREEN BAY BABYYYYYYYYYYY
our offense had a spark when we scored those 14 pts kudos to bucs defense holding us to only 14 but i am glad packers defense held up too as well idk if this will be the last time these 2 qbs play each other if it is what a final game between the 2 but if it isnt we best be ready for another qb duel in the playoffs.
Tom baby
Battle of the 12s tonight and I'm honestly happy the best man won. I think Brady is regretting his decision to keep playing but idk we'll see in week 9
accuracy beats rings. i hate both those qb's but its true
We got robbed
Damn was really hoping this would go into OT
It’s been a fair amount of time since GB had a defense that could clamp down and keep them in a game.  Still a heart attack game but a win is a win!
600k views
This reminded me of the Packers/Bucs games of the late 90s.  Tough defensive slogs
Hard to remain a Packer fan after the Favre revelations.
A Rod throw the ball so effortless!
Luv it!
Vintage Randall Cobb on the 1st half
"or maybe we'll see them again in the playoffs, sure hope not!" lol, that was funny 😂
Neither team wanted to win this game. They kept turning the football ( 🏈 ) over to each other. But I'm happy Tom Brady lost.
Why did the Pack offense fall asleep just because Jones fumbled on the two ? Being up 14-3 isn't enough to coast.
As expected, Green Bay won rather easily. Miami´s win was only surprise in the round.
After watching this I want to pull a Tim McGraw from Friday Night Lights and duct tape the football to these receivers "I want you boys to learn to hold on to the football."
0:18 bruh wtf was 29 doing lmao
Great win for the Packers , they had plenty of chances to close it out but overall showed up huge on defense that Rodgers and Cobb connection today was looking like the one from 2011
It's very frustrating to know we have a problem area, WR, and then watch their team ignore it all off season. Made worse by the fact their we just passed up option after option. The draft had a deep WR class and we had two first and two second round picks, we spent one late second round pick on a project WR and the rest on defense. There was free agent WR's available, we took none, not even Julio. There were a bunch of trades for WR, we made none. It's like the Packers front office pulled their blanky over their head to pretend Davante didn't leave.
Man now this is a good ol fashioned shoot out
The amount of turnovers in this game. My goodness lol
I root for Tampa Bay, but I'm a Nole fan first. Aaron Rodgers wanted to be a Seminole and I'm glad he got this win! Good luck, Packers! Go Bucs! Hopefully our WRs will learn how to hold onto the football.
This is where you wish Bruce Arians didn't disrespect AB
THESE NFL HIGHLIGHTS SUCK!!!  NO REPETITION OR CLOSE UP ON THE BIG PLAYS!
Brady stayed getting sold by his recivers
This is a conspiracy against brady. The beginning of every year all his wide receivers are hurt. Doesn't make any sense.
Two titans of the game clash in Tampa and no one can hold on the football and both offenses stink😂🤣. That's what I love about the NFL you just never know.
what is this s*** editing lol
Excited to see how Skip Bayless spins this one tomorrow.
Man, the durability of these QB's.  Rodgers giving dad-stares all day, and Brady with that younger-uncle hustle.
My Pacs survived another fight.
Packers was the better team
Great highlights but the picture on the start up screen is always of someone on the winning side.So it spoils watching the video by giving the outcome away 😕
Refs GAVE the GOAT and home crowd a late freebie call and they still lost. Buh BYE but don't cry you will have a bye to the playoffs cause no one else in your division can win. Ya think Brady picked this team because of that? Huh.
Man what a game. My Packers could’ve won this game by more but I’m glad it turned out to be such the defensive slugfest that it was. Anyone who thinks Brady is done is stupid! I expect to see these guys again in the playoffs with all their pieces and we’ll have to play even better than this 👏🏾👏🏾
Beasley went to the Bucs... smh.
🎉🎉🎉
I swear refs cheat for tom every game
GO PACK GO.
Green should be worried if Buc had there main team players would of been a different out come but a win is a win
Gage on the Bucs really showed heart. He had struggles early but Brady kept hitting him to bring his confidence back around. Hope he continues to get targets.
Butter fingers bowl 🤣
That’s the only way Brady has a chance; pass and hope for a PI call.
0:43 The SOFTEST sack i've ever seen in NFL... You need to retire, grandpa Brady
Gronk really isn't coming back 😢
I love watching Brady lose, what a baby. Go Pack go!
Doubs is gonna be the real deal and a prime weapon for Arod. Our defense looks great and it seems like we have a player in quay walker, him and Campbell complement each other well. It’s looking good for Green Bay 🧀
I loved how they used Dobbs like deebo Samuel
Green Bay played well and Tampa Bay's offense did not play consistent.
congrats to the Packers,beating the Bucs in their own home field.Hope the Pack makes it to the super bowl this season.
So, I don’t have to watch the TB12 get a perfect season with an 8thSB this year? #ThisIsAcceptable
LOVE saying this, again….Happy Victory Monday Pack Fans!!! Enjoy! I know I will!  GPG!!!😎🍻💚💛💚💛💚💛
Went to this🔥
I think Rogers fanatasises nothing as much as beating Brady in a match up. He is probably now in his outdoor toilet with a magazine on Tom Brady, eh,eh,eh,eh,ah,ah,ahhh,ahhh, pwhub, aaahhhhhhhhhh.
Here is the overall record these two QBs have against each other.  They are 2-2 in the regular season as Brady was 1-1 with the Patriots, and now with the Bucs.  Brady is 1-0 in the playoffs against Rogers with the Super Bowl run of two years ago.  Rogers and Brady may meet one more time in the playoffs, but time will tell if that comes to pass.
Rodgers To NINERS
YouTube splash screen spoilers. Great. Thanks.
All week all we heard was Brady was gonna eat this Packers Defense alive.   Lmao 1 Touchdown and it came in the final 2 minutes 😂    Packers Defense gonna make noise this year
Bucs offense is a hot mess atm
You can tell that Brady is frustrated with the backup wide receivers while the top 3 WR are out of this game.
😭😭
This game was played on  Arcade Mode🤣
Aaron beating Tom. Beautiful sight to see😂
Thus far, Brady has struggled in the red zone. The buccaneers offense needs to execute better.  However, really good defensive game.
For that two point conversion they counld have them comebacks or ran don’t know who idea was it to have many routes like that with backups smh. I’m not saying I’m a coach but the smarter thing would have been run or do a hitch’s or comebacks/curls.
The packers have an amazing punter.
NFC championship 22-23 game: Buccaneers vs Packers   Buccs 34-20
Packers defense 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crypto currency and NFTS will outsmart the banking system in the nearest future serving as a global fiat. Already making over 85% profit from my current investment 🤑
POV: you bet Arron Jones was going to get 60 yards and get a touchdown Aaron Jones: goes out for a whole ass quarter and makes you lose your bet
As a Brady fan I gotta tell ya GG packers. I hope we make it to the Super Bowl. But if we don’t, I’ll be rooting for Rogers to take it all the way. Gg packers.
They needed Evans😢
Brady looking good for senior citizen
Roger throwing speed and accuracy is unbelievable !
Flag on the 2 Pt try! 🤬
I was a fan of Aaron Rodgers until last year in the playoffs when he only put up 7 points on the offensive end and played with no sense of urgency and they lost and now just 14 points in this game I'm not impressed. I'm considered he's just hype now and I've been a fan of his for many years honestly but been let down to much times and came to this realization sad to say 🤦🏾‍♂️
As a big Packers fan, Rogers gave up after the 1st two TD's. Typical runup and then the momentum quits.  The GB Defense as usual was allowing too many openings that allowed Tampa to march down the field and nearly win.  Something about coming out after halftime, the opposing team has adjusted to GB's first half game plan, but GB never seems to keep the momentum during the second half. The Defensive coordinator always does this.  This happens most often at the end of the season when GB has had a successful year, but they just can't seem to get it together during playoff season!  WTF.  I will say this though, it's always and exciting game to watch when GB plays.  You never know the outcome until the very last moments of the 4th quarter.
If u look at ARod first td pass he sold it to rb n threw a laser, he’s a professional lol and Vita Vea actually caused that fumble.. hit stick in the back of Aaron Jones
Wow
That fact Brady didn’t had Julio Jones and mike Evan and played this great
I just saw the solution to the Steelers offensive woes, the I-formation!
lol
Brady’s offense started clicking at the end
I’m glad to see Green Bay win.  This game was probably the game of the week in NFL
Legends.
A-Rod threw one of his best fakes his whole career this game
Beautiful football played here gentlemen! Giselle needs to give Tom some love and support so that he can perform without any personal stuff messing with his mental!
If the buccaneers would not have turned the ball over twice, they might have won.
green bay is going to the super bowl ,I said it ,Mark this date
One of the best game today
Quay walker is seriously good don't even look lost out there
Mmmmmmm we should have won by more that 2 points but I’ll take it
Let's this sink in the Packers should easily go 4-0 over they next 4 games Pat's in Lambeau Giants in London Jets in Lambeau  and then In Washington versus Commanders putting them at 7-1 with a showdown week 9 against the Superbowl favorite Bills great win today Pack
What’s up with Packer players smacking the ball outta Buccaneers players hand 😂
When rodgers got sacked he would have just thrown it instead of pulling it in doubt was open by almost 3 yards on a slant across the middle
ryan celebrating for that fumble he did all the work lol
That play clock his 0 before the ball was snapped
We might watch reappearance of brady’s magic😢
My Packers defense showed up tonight 🙌🏽🧀
Question you should be asking is who could have afforded to give him the money to save us and why he loved us so much
G was Gile and yes your only part correct see I'm the bb
The Refs looooved turning a blind eye to the clear holding from the Tampa O-Line this game. Had to keep it competitive, I guess.
That's was a good game
I wonder what would be the outcome of this game if Mike Evans and Julio Jones were playing 🤔
Trade Mike Williams for Isaiah McKenzie ?   Fellow Fantasy Kings ?
No tablets were harmed during the making of this football game 🤣🤣
SURE HOPE NOT 😭😭😭
Why are the buccaneers signing old players
Was i the only one who seen allan lazard puke on the sideline??? After the TD orange Gatorade everywhere
thank god mike evans wasn't in this one.  the end was scary for a packers fan
Davante picked the wrong QB, and I’m a Raider fan. Carr sucks
Packers defense saved the offense.
Two greats right here take it in while we can
A nail bitter
ARE YOU THAT BAD AT YOUR JOB? IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO USE ONLY THE THUMBNAIL OF THE TEAMS. WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE RODGERS ON THE VIDEO BECAUSE WE WOULD KNOW THE PACKERS WON. UNBELIEVABLE!
Brady not looking too good with his wife leaving him
Is Brady gonna crumble like Tiger did. 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Take that Tom 😂😂😂😂 the saints will end your career here soon. Screw the playoffs. That trash qb we have oh well. As long as we send you in a coffin back to your cheating wife it’ll all be good.
Why were the packers smashing the ball out of the buccaneers hands first 2 plays lol
"sure hope not" best way to end the video
Why are the thumbnails spoiling the game results. This is annoying, can you get the previous person to do the thumbnails.
Also the pass defense is killer on the packers, the run defense for the bucs is killer
I always find it funny how people wanna compare Rodgers and Brady all the time. They’re both Al time greats so enjoy them both! Why have to hate on the other just because one gets praise and one gets hate? They both get tons of praise and hate so it’s just annoying how people get so mad over 2 great qbs we get to watch
I did not expect us to win this game
Fact Brady couldn't make 2 pt. conversion shows you how spectacular he was in the Falcons Super Bowl win ... when he had to do it twice just to finally tie.   Of course, clever play calling helped.  Not sure he's got that now!
Close game for the Bucks. Gronk is surely missed.
And don't ever rig pro basketball to compete with PlayStation y2k!!!!
Don't ever rig football again to compete with pro basketball!
Hate the comment about the onside kick. Gives me PTSD
When you lose your star offensive wideout and still beat Brady 😂
Aaron Jones better give the defense that game-day check  His fumble turned the tide
AR > Brady
I hate both these teams, but i was here for the bees!  Spoiler - nothing about the bees in this vid
I can’t believe jaire is out with a groin issue 😢
yoooooooo way to goooooo CHEEEEEESE!!!
Brady complains about not having Julio and Evans, but look at Rodgers receivers 🤡🤡🤡
GB seemed to abandon the two back sets and/or the run.  Shouldn't have been such a close game based on how they started.
"Maybe its the last time or maybe we'll see it again in the playoffs. Sure hope not."
Great defensive effort by both teams and despite it being a relatively low scoring game, both elite QBs had some good moments. I think Bucs need to move away from run game earlier if it clearly isn't working - offense clicked a lot more when they let Brady throw and play with tempo at different points in the game.
Yea! No more fixed games low score higher defense! But I like high scores but not riged to get views and tickets!
Brady missing the days when he could just chuck it up for Randy.
Yaaaaaay
aaron rogers tuesday finna be sweet
Po Gack Po ‼️
Being a Packers fan is a rollercoaster. They always give you some great games in the regular season only to choke horribly in the playoffs.
brady had no one lol rodgers suck
Brady looking real washed rn😵‍💫bucs defense has been carrying
My packers defense did their Thang today!!!
Bro the packers gotta do something about letting one mistake affect them for the rest of the game😥
Rogers got one of the most unique releases I’ve ever seen
Think it is a damshaim that one of these teams had to lose.
Absolutely night and day difference between week 1 and today.
The most technically perfect quarterback vs the winningest quarterback.
Holy holdfest the buccaneers got away with practical headlocks.
Brady never took the jab. He should be arrested and no where smart healthy people much less a football field
Important game, Packers have the tiebreaker now.
Gotta give it to the Packer defense. They held Fournette to 2.7 yds/att. and kept the GOAT out of the endzone!!!
Tom looked a little like he should have stayed retired.....
Both teams are gonna be around come late season but as a fan of brady this offense needs to find a way to score. When these receivers return from injuries I’m sure they’ll improve but this season reminds me a lot of Brady’s final season in New England. Great defense, efficient play from brady with few turnovers but just unable to make big plays and score. Especially in the redzone.
Put $500 on my Packers. Cmon now! Don't give me even moneyline! Ngl had me sweatin at the end tho!
How to stop the packers offense for the entire game: just one turnover
Brady did the best he could. The line doesnt look good and the wr has hands with melted butter. Still it came to the last play in the end because of the defense.  I miss chris godwin
1k commenter
I’m the 1000 comment
I love it ✌👊❤
The I can’t stand either one of these teams game! They both suck! Peace!
Shows how even at his age Brady is still money. Bucs just had too many turnovers.
Should have been 21-12
This coulda been a high scoring gaming. But the fumbles….. good to have the win tho lol go pack go
As a Packers fan did not think we were going to win going into the game , The Buc's run defense scared me since I know right now The Packers need to be able to run and Th Buc's have one of the best run defense's in the game and I think between the 2 duo they had less then like 75 yards so even better to get the win by passing with the defense looking good.
Outstanding win.
WHEN YOU SEE ROMEOOO!!! THROW UP THE WW'S!!! LETS GO PACK!!! CHEESEHEAD4LIFE!!!
https://youtu.be/vpSZ8tZldf4
Should have been extra td  but fumbled.  Still they won.
Tampa sucks 😂
People really forget the packers have one of the best defenses in the league.
I do not understand why Rodgers and Brady playing in a regular season game matters . It's not the same as like Brady vrs. Manning (both Manning's actually) where they were for a lot of seasons the 2 best/better/ teams in The AFC . Brady only played 2 + this seasons in The NFC , also I don't think most Packers fans have "bad blood" over The Buc's knocking us out 2 years ago when they stacked that Tampa roster   , The Packers could have won the game but overall made to many mistakes. I still hate The Cowboys because they kept The Packers out of the post season in the 90's and The Vikings since they have beaten us a lot goin back to Brett as QB even though we overall mostly got further.
Offensively greenbay was still terrible. No points after the first half. That's not super bowl material. Shout out to the defense!! Aaron Rogers put some numbers up man. Can we get another super bowl ring?? You only got 1. Peace ✌️ Put extra time on the clock and Tom would've won this game with field goals. Put some numbers up Rogers. Good job defense. Receivers need to do their job and get open.. this game was 🗑️. 14 points. That's it??
Rodgers Own Tampa Bay. Cant Wait For Undisputed
"The losing QB has to call their family" 😭💀
and watch them choke again in the playoffs
Arod playing like he in the Super Bowl lol
Goes to show you Green Bay has good enough defense  to go all thr way . Same at San Francisco  defense will carry 49ers  to final
That Packers offense needs to be a little better.
Let’s go pack dawgs‼️💯
Those post-catch fumbles by Tampa Bay WREAKED them.
All that money and draft picks GB spent and our defense still semi-sucks
Surprise, surprise. The Packers beat the Bucs (**upset**). No respect on the name. Put it where it belongs.
“I sure hope not”😂
I’m going to be honest Green Bay needs to be in this super bowl  this year with Kansas City
Two washed up QBs...Terrible game.  #Ninergang
Packers get the best of the Bucs. All Packers fan think Super Bowl, where the Green and Gold steamroll the AFC; the first SB win of a legendary three-peat!!! Yep, Rodgers goes out in style.
Should’ve retired
I love Packers 💚💛😘😍
Can I root for both of these teams to lose?
9:29 *is what Sir John Madden used to call a "SNOTKNOCKER"!!!* 🥲
Bucs got the All Stars
Biden was installed and the WEF and elites are destroying our republic to implement the great reset!!!!
What's the excuse for Tom today? He needs to overcome. He's at home. Isn't that what they say about Aaron?
Brady and Rodgers will never face-off in a Super Bowl. Minus the goofy League shuffle.
Tampa is a who's who I'd 2017 high draft cast-offs
HEY FUCKWIPES. THERE'S NO SUCH TEAM AS TAMPA. IT'S TAMPA BAY.
If only #7 on the BUCS chased after the ball on the 2 pt conversion once it was broken up would've took the life from the Packers
Happy to see Aaron Rodgers finally beat brady it’s been a while damn feels good cause that was a close one
Sick of thumbnails giving away the result.
no
Bucs offense is trash
Cant wait for undisputed
Really good game. Both QBs played well.
Packers D is legit.  NFL on notice
Tampa Bay had every opportunity to win, but choked on every opportunity!
Made sure to watch this playoffs two good QBs both with remarkable passes tho I hope we get to see more games like this in the near future great game tho gotta hand it to both teams
Roger Goodell had to make sure that Kaaron Rodgers won
God loves you come to him and repent
had a feeling packers would win this one
We now own the important ties breaker.    I have always said it should be a tie breaker only when the away team wins unless they playa home and away.
Brady and bucs had no starting receivers and offensive linemen and they still almost tied up green bay with just one good hurry up drive. If they had some of their starters they would have smoked them like previous times or how the vikings smoked them🤣
Boring ass game!!!
Do the Bucs miss Bruce Arians or is Tom Brady not all in?
WTF NFL App! 1st week couldn't watch my team in landscape without it switching to another game then today watching the last minute of this game, for unknown reasons NFL app stopped coverage with 14sec to go & showed an empty press room but I was able to switch to radio broadcast sadly after the touchdown. NFL app very glitchy since they unpartnered with Verizon & is not free anymore for Verizon customers 👎
Not all fumbles are equal.   That goal line fumble by Jones really cost points and momentum.   Why does he do this in important games ?   Like this tie breaker and playoff losses.
Vita Vea in zone coverage!?? I've finally seen it all!! 😆 🤣 😂  #BowelsYouWild
If you ever have to win by an onside kick, You Suck.
Ive seen a bunch of packers fans say Rodgers had no good recievers to throw to and its like do you not know who Randall Cobb is? The Bucs need to really work on ball control though especially with #17 there. Dude single handedly cost them that game
after that Jones fumble n the end zone... the motion of the game switched... thank god the defense played good... on both sides... the defenses were on lock 🔐
LMAO THE GOAT.😂😂
What a game by the defense.   I hope finally all the high draft picks are going to pay off for the Pack. However, why is it that the first drive always looks porous.
GB Offense garbage in 2nd half all 3 games this yr
Fun game, but as a Packer fan, I don't wanna see that Buc offensive with Brady throwing to a full compliment of receivers.  Good receivers seem to gravitate to Tampa and Brady eventually.  How did they get a guy like Beasly? And do NOT put off another Gronk comeback.
You can tell Tom likes gage jr
Rodgers got lucky. Cause Brady would've torched him.
Still can't believe people had these teams going over 20 apiece, nevermind sniffing it.
I said, if the Bucs went with a passing game with GB they would lose, they needed to run the ball more
Hey not pretty but we BEAT THE BUCS... finally
Don’t get to excited greenbay barley won this game Tampa turnovers kept Brady off the field not the packers offense.
An Instant Classic!!!!
A weird game.  The Packers looked unstoppable in the first half ... until Aaron Jones' fumble, then neither team could do anything on offense for the rest of the game as the defense on both teams took over.
It looked here like Brady didn't get that touchdown pass off before the play clock. It was snapped at zero at least in this video.
When you're not a fan of either team, but hold both QB's in such high regards, it doesn't matter who won. Just great to watch them play.
GoPackGo
As a Ravens fan I love watching Rashod Bateman suck.  Hang on to the ball bro.  Also. On a side note. It's gonna be a sad season when we don't get to see Brady or Aaron playing.
Dear packers defense: DO NOT BLITZ BRADY!!!!! YOU GOT LUCKY TONIGHT
Is it just me or did Cobb look a little faster than normal? Seemed like he was less sluggish or something he just looked quicker crisper and faster hope he stays healthy and keeps it up! GPG!
No one has played at a higher level than Gronk
Tom who never heard of him
Rodgers and the Packers show the QB makes the WR and not the other way around. Adams went to the Raiders and Carr is a decent QB, but Adams so far looking pretty bad while Packers went into this season with the big unknown at the WR group with even Rodgers having concerns. Now they look like a really decent veteran WR group, all because of Rodgers.
Brady dont have nothing for still playing I don't understand that guy.
Rodgers deflated Brady
aaron jones fumble in the 2nd quarter changed the entire momentum of the game
The bucs offense is so bad this season lol
Maybe the dullest game of the day…. From a packers fan
Jajajaja perdió Tom Brady
Go Pack Go,  great win
Brady is overrated.
😢😢😂😢😢😢
Fumble from jones made it be wayyy to cringe at the end but this game was extremely exciting
God watching Brady play makes me want to fall asleep
Thanks for the heart attack Green Bay 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brady head is elsewhere
It wouldn't have mattered if Campbell tipped the ball or not at the end. Savage was plastered on him it would've been broken up regardless
tampa needed to stay undefeated, ugh
Antivax cucktard gets lucky
The chip just got bigger for Tom. See everyone in post season ✌️
Yes im happy for green bay. Damn bucks only play a hand full of playoff teams lucky ......
Karma for the bucs from last week's bs drama
What a game , bucs should capitalize on those packers turnovers though , plus they fumbled a lot giving the ball right back
I love how the refs tried to bail Brady’s ass out again for the millionth time with that horrible PI call and the clown still couldn’t win😂
Tom Brady's looking old he should have already retired
Was it not pass interference because the ball got tipped first on the 2pt?
@3:05 No-look??
I kinda expected more from Rodgers because Brady had more offensive team members who were out. Both defense were great and both quarterback sucked in this game lol.
Anytime Brady gets beat, I’m happy.
The refs did everything they could to help the Bucs
I still don't know how good the Packers and the Bucs are.
Epic game... better team won Go Pack go!
Great game,two legends.....
Mike evans was definitely missed today
If watt plays Pittsburgh can beat Tampa bay
Brady should have given it to 16. He was clearly on sight.
Brady will get Packers in the playoff.
Bro fumbled twice yikes Tom don’t got his main receivers they shoulda kept Tyler Johnson
Damnet. The only time I want Brady to win and he doesn't. 🙄
Brady is clearly injured
Frustrating game to watch for fans of both teams.
3:43 he got hit with two helmets. No call/flag? Ok….home field advantage.
2 Point Win Against An Half Injured Offense . Not Impressed!
Those Bucs fumbles earlier in the game when they were driving lost them the game.
Brady couldn’t capitalize on the refs help on those awfully wrong kick return penalties.  Brady is junk, go back home to your wife.  Bucs are about to fade back into irrelevancy.
Did Brady break any tablets? Lol 😂
Another rigged Brady contest.  Scores their only TD at the very end of the game, to make it a cliff hanger.  Tampa's defense is what's making them a strong contender this year.  It's not that old man!
Go packers!!!!🎉
THAT was for sure a vita vea fumble from the LB spot lmfao 3:34
Tampa has no pass D. OMG
Go Pack Go
Heartstopping win ....but fantastic game guys
Bucs were lucky to be close. Fumble just outside the goal line by Jones would have put this pretty well out of reach at the end.
Why packers play 3 attack in a row in 1st half?
🙄
brady can kiss my ass.. i love seeing that wimp lose..
As a Packers fan I will just say what a game. Green Bay needed the W and they got it. Bucs fell a little short at the end, but this game was mainly a defensive battle for my Packers and Tom Bradys Bucs. #GO PACK GO.
Hats off to GB special team and punter. They did a great job of keeping the Bucs within the 10 yard line and not letting them return past the 25. Last year, they were TERRIBLE! Also,  their redzone defense is legit. Last week,  they stopped the Bears on 4th and goal on the 1 yard line. Last, but not least, Randall Cobb came thru for the youngstas. Go Pack Go
Come show love building my YouTube up
Game of the week for sure
Any day Brady loses is a good day. 😂 I can't stand his fan base.
Good game
Old blood needs to sit down and watch !!
Great matchup, pretty evenly matched teams. I give the Bucs a slight edge, if they had the 6 starters on offense that were hurt, especially at WR.
It’s a great day to be a Packers fan.
As a North Texas native I’m so happy to see Cole Beasley on a great team, was sad to see he was cut from the Bills
Bucs have nothing to hang there head over about this loss , they only lost by 2 points and that was without a lot of  there key players !   I would say, nothing to get excited  about if your a Packer fan !
The look on Brady's face most of the first half just looked like his heart wasn't in it.
With Mike Evans Brady would have won that
So the GB offense left a lot on the field today. Defense can only create so many stops. We gotta score
idk what is tempa defence doing on first quartre
Welp, low scoring like we expected, but I honestly didn't see us winning. Go Pack Go!
Beasley lined up wrong and Brady had to tell him to move and ran out of time, lost the game. Then you see Beasley and Rodgers, both antivaxxers, laughing together after the game. 🧐
Its not Dobs its Doubs.....
Battle of no wrs
Go pack Go.
we won ... stop nit picking ... girls .......
It’s a battle of the bays!
It was about time Brady and his Suckaneers lost a game..
Damn so close
Bucs fans should be hopeful. We have an elite defense. If we had more than a handful of starters on offense, we would taken this game. If we can get healthy, there is another championship possibly on the horizon
You could *feel* the void left by Evans not being able to play. You could really tell how out of sync Tampa was without him. Maybe the stars will align again IF these two teams make the playoffs.
Execution for the buccaneers 😢
Brady shoulda ran it in
As a packers fan Rodgers beating Brady this is like a Super Bowl win in our eyes
Fumble by WR KILLED US
Rodgers GOAT!
Yeaaaaah! What a game for Green Bay Packers!🔥💯
Nfl playoffs and superbowls are rigged by the illuminati freemasonry religion cult
This game should have been over at half time. Should have. But a win is a win.
M0d3√ F-k3r  retire already!
Brady needs to find a real team or retire.
Heartwrenching game to watch. Brady clapped his hands for the snap and the center didn't snap it which caused the delay of game, otherwise we would've tied it up with that run and had a chance in OT. Such a shame. I don't see the Bucs missing playoffs but they've gotta remain healthy otherwise it might be doomed.
Go Pack Go good game Tampa Bay hopefully we meet again the playoffs you guys had me worried and th secomd half when shut Packers offense down an second half
Yo Winfield was getting torched this game.
Packers got lucky today
I remember having classes with Cameron Brate in high school and it’s still so crazy seeing him be a key part of the highlights vs the Packers!
Glad they lost
*Congrats Packers Fans* You've won your 15 straight SB in September 🤣
Man as a Brady fan gg Aaron Rodgers and Packers I was having a heart attack almost during the 4th quarter. Hopefully this isn’t their last meeting Im hoping they can meet again in the playoffs when both these teams are fully healthy. But damn was that final drive for Brady. Just need the Buccs offense to come alive, they beat themselves by being to sloppy with fumbles and fumbled that flea flicker early in the 4th, Buccs could’ve had an extra 7-10 points but other than that both these defenses proved why they’re among the best in the league.
Go Pack Go!! Thanks Green Bay Packers!!!!👏😃
Can't cheat all the time! Good job, Packers!
Aaron doesn’t f@ck around with that ball. 😉
RUN RUN RUN RUN AND PASS ON FIFTH DOWN. WHY COULDN'T THEY DO WHAT THEY DID IN LAST 2 MINUTES THE FIRST 58 MINUTES? BUCS NEED A BETTER PLAY CALLER.
Brate is such an amazing actor. I’m glad that it worked out for them 😂 we all love cheese. Go pack. Tom seems a bit distracted.
Refs cheated for Brady and he still lost. Not PI at 8:44, they're both pushing each other. Delay of game at 9:27 and no call, refs literally blow him after every game. Didn't even watch the game and there 2 here already. #FakeSport
Bucs had no starting wide receivers and Tom Brady still managed 🫢. Just imagine if they were all present. Good game though.
Actually never mind they did face off in the championship game but this is a different season so let's see
As predicted, the Refs show up to penalize the opposing teams final drive and give Brady a PI to keep a 4th qtr game winning drive alive. Then gift them the TD 1 second after the play clock expired. Im surprised they called it on the 2 pt, most likely cuz the announcers made such a big deal about it. Rashan Gary was being held every angle possible entire game, only got flagged once. Packers had to play super sharp to not even breath on a WR on that 2 pt play.
THANK YOU GREEN BAY!!! #F BRADY🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
The Packers turnover was the game changer for this game and GB still won the game without scoring a point in the 2nd half that's rare.
Rodgers vs Brady, is this the last we seen of these two legends go at it? Maybe an NFC title game meeting to end it.
Bucs needed this one, this will cost them in the end.
I don't know cuz I watch so many games whoever in the comments tell me has Aaron Rodgers and Brady ever met up in the game cuz to me this is an ultimate dual TB12 vs AR12
They both played like rookies, OMG like the Lions 😯 TB12 was on the money though and his boy's didn't catch the ball so Shannon can't blame Brady.. or yes he will smh
What Brady wasn’t able to send the game in to OT. Glad they lost but I’ll be impressed if they don’t go to the SB again
Green  Bay better get someone in to teach them how to run the nickle defense!  They are so bad at it that I wonder why they even have it in their play book.
Ya Rodgers.
At ago Roger's
That was close
Everybody know AD better
Brady lost to the GOAT
Fumbles on fumbles on fumbles
The buccaneers delay of game at the end which cost the buccaneers to send it to overtime really good game watch it from start to finish.
Refs did their best to try to hand Brady the win. Its so blatant these days.
Brady is over  Horrible offense
Notice how the Packers were going after the ball, even after the receiver was down. Great coaching!
Skip Bayless can’t wait to see him in the morning 😂😂😂😂
7:20 - why did the clock stop here?
Heard some boos there when the Bucs kicked a field goal. They upset with their QB? Its the defense  running the team right now and keeping them in games, folks.
Offense and defense is starting to heat up, although Offense still needs a little bit more work. A win against the Bucs and Brady is good enough for me even without their starters on WR; the Bucs still had R. Gage, C. Brate, B. Perriman, S. Miller, C. Beasley, K. Rudolph and L. Fournette 🤷💪👏
Multiple fumbles hurt the Bucs big time..even Brady rushing yards got canceled by penalties. Penalties everywhere bruh..that delay of game at 2 yard line is so terrible can't believe the center took his damn time to snap that ball..well kudos to Brady signaling like hell at the last moment causing the delay
Green Bay fan….. we need to stop slapping balls after the catch. Poor sportsmanship…. Good win …..god bless.
You know, Green Bay receivers really stepped up. Dobbs played really well and lazard had a couple nice grabs. If they can build some chemistry over the first half of the season they just might be a sleeper wide receiver corp
I'm just here to leave a comment  waiting for Tampa Bay fans and TB fans to give me tons of excuses as to why they lost or how the refs screwed them.
The Bucs should have won the game, players dropping and  fumbling the ball from Brady earlier in the game. At the end a good hard fought from them and nearly pull it off.
this hurts...come on bucks....you are way better than that.
Bucs would have won if not for lack of receivers
Why would u not tie it up....This is the true coaching of Tampa Bay ...This was a Coaching loss
Why watch the highlight to find out the score, when the score is on the thumbnail?   Thanks, for nothing.
Typical Brady choke
Would have liked to have seen this one, but must settle for highlights.  BOAT beats GOAT!!  GO! PACK, GO!!! 🥳🥳🥳
Packers hold on to hand the Bucs their first loss, Packers defence playing exceptional and unknown receiver Doub enable the win on the road....
Love watching 2 goats battling eachother 💯 good game for both teams!
Packers should have had it 35-10
Cry baby 🍼 Brady always on sideline... Was a great game...GO PACK GO 💚💛
Some pretty dumb play calls from Leftwich and the Bucs staff late in the game? All your all star receivers are out, so why on earth would you be using trickery play calls and slap counts, with an O line and WR’s who just started playing with Brady 2 months ago? Gotta keep it simple man, especially in a big game at home?
Old man lost again
My team won yay I’m crying of joy 😢yay awesome 😢🎉❤
Bruhh just catch and tuck the ball
Excited to see Doubs grow. Him and Arod about to be LETHAL.
GO PACK GO 🎉🎉
IN YOUR FACE TAMPA👏
Good defensive game! Nuff Said!
More kids are at these gams.
bucs offensive this yr sucks!
Packer offense needs to do more in the second half.
Fans are plain-old stupid if they can't tell that the Packers deliberately allowed the TD drive that made it 14-12. No effort was made to cover receivers.
This year higlights are messed up... some bad edition and no replay at all...
Tampa is not making to the playoffs the way they been playing
This was good for the rookie receivers especially doubs he went in today.
There are the best teams ., but the last year's Superbowl halftime show was crap ,pip hookers,singing about drug. Should have marching band.from allover. Stop that pips and hookers show.
My Bucs offense is banged up. Too many mistake and drops.  Props to the Packers though
We have not seen the last of these two.
Where are all the bucs fans now???
The Pack is Back 💚
Two legends went at it. Great game! AR is a baaaaaad man!
ROMEO DOUBS ERA HAS BEGUN #87
Arbitragem fazendo de tudo para ajudar o Tampabay. 😡😡😡😡😡
Why wasn’t Rashaad White, a better catching RB in on the 2-point conversion instead of Fournette? Bad play calling from OC again and not understanding personnel!
Now this was real  football - Not the Madden Play station that Mahomes and Josh Allen are used to playing
O yea my team green bay packers won
GO PACK GO!
so pack barley beat tampa at 50%. Not that impressive.
Father Time caught up with Tom Brady, But then again, I admire him for being at it for so long...You don't see many 40 something guys playing quarterback....
... great-game. There are few-times when we have the opportunity to see Legends compete in the same space.
Is Dobbs a future great 😮
What a game 😮
Tbh if he comes back even 90%. I wouldn’t be surprised if TB12 doesn’t try and recruit OBJ. Could you imagine an outside of Mike Evans and Odell… with Tom Brady throwing the ball.
Did Tom shake hands or ran away like a b!tch?
Where's gronk
WR fumbles lost the game for the Bucs. Both in FG range and lost it
Davante Adams sitting on his couch after going 0-3 like “ What The Hell Am I Doing?”😂😂😂😂😂
Tampa suck
As a Bears fan, I must say it's rather refreshing to see real, actual QBs in action.
Tampa's delay of game on a 2 point conversion to tie the game was inexplicable.
GPG.  GGs to the Bucs man. Really.
360p? Seriously?
bucs winning super bowl this year. look at our defense and when we get our weapons back GG
No one was picking GB to win. A few were even saying it might be a blowout. These team's defenses will carry them this year.
Rodgers got lucky...
The NFL is getting the parity it wants.  If the Giants lose tomorrow night we will down to 2 undefeated teams after only 3 weeks.  I've never seen so many exciting finishes.  There were 3 games in the early time slot today that weren't decided until the last 30 seconds.
Leta face it, any team with Brady as qb is bound to win .
I was rooting for the Packers to win! and I’m a bears fan
I can already here the Brady fans he didn't have his wrs, if he the goat he don't need him
Battle of the 12s. Great game. Go Packers Go.
Aaron Rodgers is superior to Tom Brady 😅😊
Always remember, G comes Before T.
Rodgers is the GOAT.
Nah where are all the Brady fan boys at now???? Oh y’all quite now huh
That "sure hope not" at the end threw me off guard for a second. At first I thought the commentator meant that he would "sure hope not" to see Rodgers/Brady again, but then after a moment I realized he meant that he "sure hopes not" that today was the last time we saw the two play against each other.
Both Brady and Rodgers played a great considering the power of both defences
Proud of the Bucs for putting up a fight. The offense is totally screwed right now.... Hope we can get things turned around or it could be an excruciating season.
Damn Brady played a good game. Just need some consistent play makers
Hats off to GB. 😂
GO PACK GO
LET'S GO PACK YEA BABY
12 points against that trash? Tampa is a joke. Brady should have stayed with his manly controlling wife.
Jim Grey acts like Brady is the second  coming of Jesus ..if he's so great why does he feel the need to cheat..DEFLATE GATE..AND FILMING OTHER TEAME PRACTICES!!!! GREY IS BUSH LEAUGE
THANK YOU PACKER D. AND SPECIAL TEAMS.
Rogers shot him self in the foot by wanting so much more money instead of being like Brady and being “Team Friendly” but that’s what you get when you have a selfish and finger pointer of a person like Rogers. He’s more worried about himself than winning rings and winning MVP’s which doesn’t win Championships. He will blame everyone else for his actions than anyone else. I rather have Joe Flacco who btw has as many rings as Rogers lmao. He either will play like a hero and be “hurt” then come back to make a comeback or he will just tell people to “R.E.L.A.X” or point the finger at everyone else when he’s got control of the team more than he seems to make known. Especially when it comes to his contract situation and screwing over his chances to get a SECOND RING lmao he’s got no room to be in control when he’s not anywhere near a Brady or anyone whose got more than one ring lol. Just makes me laugh how selfish of a person he is in every way and thinks he’s owed something
Chicken shyt PI call but thank the football gods Green Bay still won
Felt like homelander in the movie theater watching that flea flicker and two point conversion
This was a wicked game - Rodgers owned the1st Half and Brady made it it thrilling at the end - 2 old man giving it all
Refs were trying so hard
Yes I get the bucs have injuries and everything happens on the offensive side but y’all need to step up in put points on the board or trade for someone who can help Brady .   It’s teams who have a lot of WR , TE and RBs that not being used put them to Work because it’s getting ridiculous.
Was nice to watch Brady lose this game in the last few seconds.
A NEW GOAT HAS BEEN CROWNED 👑 BOW DOWN BEFORE AARON RODGERS YOUR NEW GOAT
Brady to perfect
Gosh you could tell Brady was less lethal.. But that final 2 min.. 2 point conversion. Any one wanna bet with any weapons or a well drilled team like when with Patriots 9 times out of 10 he would've sealed that draw.
Brady was masterful and outplayed Rogers again.  Unfortunately the fumbles by his teammates plus a defense thst gave up too many first downs on third down situations was the difference  in this game. Poor Tom Brady, no Evans,  plus the other injuries to starters.  The bucs need them all back soon.
Was really hoping the Bucs won this one.
Two of the best white qb’s to ever play! Shame there won’t be another like them for decades to come with them finally integrating other races to the position in ‘93.
Both of these defenses are vicious
Too two many missed caches...🤔
👏👏👏
Tampa defense started off slow allowing the packers to score early and the turnovers by Tampa along with penalties and mistakes made a win difficult. Our defense needs to come out playing like they did in the second half for the rest of the year
Like Romeo doubs
If my daddy suspended Tampa's best player I could beat them too.
You can't lose the turnover battle and expect to win the game.
Curious to hear from the haters how the refs won the game for the packers
Watching these 2 legends have to play with these terrible Wrs was awesome lol
Looking to get into the Nfl need a team any recommendations?
I picked the Packers to win because the Bucs' offense is a mess.
Both teams should scout WRs at the home depot parking lot. Can't be any worse than this lol
3:04 GB did not get this play off in time?
This will be remembered as Brady-Rodgers IV, but really this was Todd Bowles vs. Joe  Barry
So privileged to watch these 2 play
Battle of the defenses
Congratulations to the Green Bay Packers!!
They really tried to gift wrap this for Tom.  So many phantom calls on the packers and that punting penalty was probably one of the worst calls of the year.  #bradyeffect
He could of thrown that ball to Fournette by the pylon
Great game for Allen Lazard.  🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎
3:35 in and I think I know where this is going. 🤷
Hope you feel good Mike Evans, you have as much maturity as Aqib Talib and his ignorant brother, grow up....cost your team a loss cuz you wanna be gangsta !
Man. The defense saved the game for us. The offenses was great until Jones Fumble, then it just completely stopped in the 2nd half ( besides the 2 Lazard catches ). Granted there was some questionable penalty and non calls I saw but w/e you can't trust the refs to be competent. I was not confident with the Packers just having 14 points, or how much the offenses kept stalling and kept pushing the defense back out there. The offenses got to get better
Finally NFL can see what AR12 can do with a A+ Defense like TB12 always has just saying
Last game 😔 Brady vs Rodgers
Bucs are gonna be dangerous af once their top 3 wrs come back I feel bad for the chiefs brady doesn't lose back to back ever
Hold that mfin L Tampa. Worst team an fans in the nfl.
All I have to say is that in the record books this is going to be a win for Green Bay but how can you look at this as anything other than a loss for green bay, I mean only 14 points against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team who had Tom Brady with absolutely no one to throw the football too, you might be a delusional Green Bay fan but no one can look at this game and think that Green Bay has the better team, if Tampa Bay would have only had Mike Evans today they would have won this game there is absolutely no reason to think if they had Chris Godwin and Julio Jones and Mike Evans today Tampa Bay would have won this game going away, it wouldn't even have been close because Tampa Bay's defense played very well and they held Green Bay to only 14 points, so if Green Bay can look at themself in the mirror and actually think that this is a win for them they're delusional, if they had lost today this would have looked absolutely embarrassing considering that they almost gave it away at the very end...
Go green bay
Mike evans punching the air right now 😮‍💨
Packers offense looks like dog water 😅
The Buccs needed that Aaron Jones fumble otherwise this would not have been the great game it turned out to be. Rodgers and Brady are absolute beasts! Both went against pretty defensive performances!
A bittersweet day for Skip. Brady lost while Baker with his first win.🌈
Lazard scores runs off and pukes,  then comes back 2nd half to help the team with a important catch. Game Mvp
Looks like Brady needs elite receivers to win games.
Rodgers.. The true goat
Bucs have no offense
THE GAME WAS THRILLING AS HELL THAN THE UPCOMING SUPERBOWL
gg especially for both defense
Congrats on beating a buccaneers team with worse WRs than you guys 😂😂😂 If mike evans is in this game you guys for sure lose.
Rodgers crumbled when the pressure was highest,  brady exceled when the pressure was highest regardless of score... Rodgers talent shown as greater than Brady but Bradys pure competitive drive which makes him the GOAT was clearly stronger... they both are who we thought they are.. One for the ages
In the Rodgers vs Brady saga, it has gone  Rodgers Brady Brady Brady  Rodgers
Unless Yahweh builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.  (Psalm chapter one hundred twenty-seven)
Kyle Rudolph  hell ya
The tRump Humpers LOSE!
I think my Packers have weapons and if Andy Reid was our coach we would have put up 30 today
Well this is how I actually pitcher this game if the packers were gonna win   psychologically that is big for the defense & the psyche of the whole team shout- out to the new special teams coach After 3 weeks they're much improved
Wanna see Rodgers win it all this year. Really upset the woke left even more.
Excellent.
Go Pack Go
This whole week in the NFL was lame
GOAT Godgers & Marino owning the best system QB Brady😱
Absolute GARBAGE from Greenbay for the 2nd half. Who wouldn't bet Bardy for the classic 2nd half come back? Everybody and their mother did. Also consider all the live spread (ANY live spread) bets which covered in the last 2 minutes. Just disgusting.. 🤮🤢
As far as regular season goes, this might be it. Hopefully these two great QBs meet in post season for one last showdown
Doobs is getting that trust from rodgers
Good game, tough loss for Tampa Bay.
That’s what you call a football game
Gopackgo
Shannon Sharpe is going to have a field day on Undisputed tomorrow! Skip gonna blame Todd Bowles instead of Brady. Watch! 🤣
The Bucs lost this game,  the Packers did not win. I'm so sick of seeing Rodgers hold on to the ball when he has wide open WR. He needs to stop being 'Aaron Rodgers ' and start playing like he is willing to do what it takes to win. He isn't a leader and that'd why he crumbles. His window closed last season and the Packers will be lucky to come out of the WC round.
Damn evans, Godwin and Jones out and they barely won
Not that great a game, but considering it was probably the final game between Rodgers and Brady, I will take what I can get. Good win for the Packers 👍
I hope the packers aren't proud of beating the bucs with 0 starting receivers lmao.
im very sad
I was hoping Brady would be the comeback kid but good game overall and Gage damn near got knocked out on that touchdown catch
Bucs O Line is garbage lmao
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine 💖 Keep up the good work, you never let your fans down with great entertainment 😎
Great game! Considering Tampa were missing their top three receivers, I thought Tom did one hell of a job!
The delay play clock reminds me of the year they win it all, when Brady forgot what down it was. This year really resembles 2020.
I swear the Bucs threw the whole game intentionally for money or something, how do you score in the last minute of the game but can't even go further than 20 yards 2 out of the 20 times on the field..
This is why A-Rod is the 🐐
Brady needs more weapons. His accuracy is flawless
Brady didn’t score in the first half and Rogers didn’t score in the second half. 2 Fumbles cost bucks this game.
Tom Brady gotta be mad at his offensive line that’s the reason they lost
Why was the Bucs Offense all Packed together on right side of Endzone During 2 point try?...All that Traffic in the Endzone with all the defenders around 1 place...Weird
Finally Rodgers beats Brady lol
Brady without a couple of key players played one heck of a game still the greatest of all time.
Poor play by TB12
Rodgers sucks. Packers won't win another game this season
Aaron Rodgers gets a *RARE* win at Tampa
9:25 play clock at 00. I fukking hate Tom Brady
Completely different game if both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin were out there.
Greenbay 🧀
Brady had to feel like he was back on the 2019 Patriots team with the weapons he had today lmao.
That was a hell of a game Packers beat brings ass
Here comes the 1-3 for the Patriots next week in Green Bay! 😑
Great to see doubs step up and prove some of that hype was real
This might be the last time we'll ever have Brady Rodgers match, unless if they meet each other again in the playoffs.
Crazy game
You can’t put into words what a job the packers did today. Even with the offense taking off the entire second half. They fought to the last play and got the win, it was ugly but we will take it.
When Brady loses, America wins
Brady can't get it done without Gronk...just sayin'
hah! suck it Brady. you old ass man
Bucs: PSG! Packers: FC Barcelona!
Brady: Ronaldo! Rodgers: Messi!
A win is a win, but I don’t think anyone should feel good about this Packers team yet. They got a looooong at to go.
Keep asking , how the packers came all the way on the Road to win at tampa but lost in a horrible way against the vikings, of course tampa Is stronger than the vikings
Everybody had butter fingers this game lmao wtf
Only true NFL fanatics know that the Buccaneers and Packers used to be bitter division rivals back in the old days. The Houston Texans were an expansion team in 2002 and the divisions had to be shrunken to 4 teams each. It was the departure of the Bucs from the NFC North (Packers, Lions, Vikings, Bears). Brett Favre threw and caught his first pass against the Buccaneers.
Packers beat Bucs and Refs at the same time in Tampa 👍🔥
The packers are in major trouble if Alexander is gonna be out for any length of time. If Brady isn’t playing with a second string oline and practice squad receivers they beat Green Bay by 21 or more.
You can always expect a down to the wire finish between these QBs.
Loving Greg Olsen as a commentator
As a Bucs fan, great job Packers, good game and a well fought one! Despite both our teams missing a lot of talent, still was an entertaining game to watch although I was definitely yelling at the TV a bit too much haha, good game guys! #GoBucs
Go pack go 💚💛
Why hasn't the prevent defense been outlawed in Green Bay? It never works.
At least we actually got to see the Tampa TD & 2pt attempt here, unlike on NFL+ (which is a complete POS).
Gage got concussed but will put him in still
No way they don't include that delay of game on the 2-pt attempt.... Can't make the NFL's golden boy look bad, nahah, can't have that.
Eagle's best team in NFC if not the whole NFL right now anyway
Looks like that BS suspension really helped the Pack. Sad, Bucs didn’t have any of their starting receivers and still almost won.
Rodgers and Packers earned that win. Hope to see Packers rematch in the playoffs.
LETS GOOOOOO
I hope this isn’t the last time we see these legends, battle it out.
Aaron Rogers finally found a way to beat Tom Brady and the Bucs what a big moment for the Packers everyone here give a clap for Aaron Rogers and the Packers! See you guys next week
In the potential last meeting between the 12s, it was more of a defensive showcase.
GG packers respect for you guys my bucs have some major work to do especially when we face Kansas City next I have major respect for Aaron Rodgers GG packers🏈👍
Really don’t want this to be the last Brady-Rodgers matchup, defensive slugfest, both offenses trying to still figure it out.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPEN TO RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, ITS THE FOUNDATION THE NFL WAS BUILT ON, I AM SICK OF EVERY TEAM THROWING NOW ON EVERY DAMN PLAY, JIM BROWN AND BARRY SANDERS COULD BE IN YOUR BACKFIELD TODAY, AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW, TIRED OF THIS PASS HAPPY ASS NFL, R.I.P TO WALTER PAYTON A.K.A SWEETNESS ONE OF THE GREATEST🏈💯
No touchdown for Tampa Bay.....the clock ran out.
Lmao Brady had no weapons and almost still beat Rogers this rediculous
I love buthurt Tom Brady fans tears
Fun Fact:This Is Rodgers First Win Against Brady Since Week 13 2014
Go Pack Go
Poor editing
I Made sure to watch this game start to finish because this might be the last time we get to see these to all time great Quarterbacks face off against each other. Rodgers played pretty well, but both these defenses are legit and terrify me as an Eagles fan. This was one of the best games because it was a defensive slugfest.
Bucs defense is elite offense not so much
When Brady looses the world wins!
Evans! Julio! & Godwin all out. No need to celebrate
To many penalties and turnovers in key moments and but despite it all we still had a chance thanks to the defense just a tough loss smh.
That final drive was absurd to watch. With 0 regular WRs in vs an elite D, Brady drove 80 yards to score. Great play by Campbell at the end to secure GB the win.
Both Rays and Bucs loss today. Sad day in Tampa. GG Packers
Roger's carry his teams jeez
the delay of game on the 2 pt conversion... hate to see it. wonder if we would have had a different outcome if they managed to play it then
GO PACK GO! SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS 2023!!!!!!!!!
Rodgers: I can’t defeat Brady on playoff, better to do now.
So close Brady
sad we need mike and chris
Hopefully this wasn't the last time we see Brady vs Rogers.. Spectacular finish
How did Bucs get away with delayed of the game at the last scoring drive?
Crazy, Brady gets a taste of what Rodgers has to deal with on a weekly basis
Who dat ⚜️let’s go packers
Bucs defense showed up yet again but the offense is struggling with injuries to the line and at wide receiver. Bucs might be the greatest team all around of ALL TIME if everyone is healthy.
The “sure hope not” at the end💀💀💀
Hats off to the Packers defense. Offense has to figure out a way not to continually stall after starting off so hot.
Even though it wasn't a high-scoring game it was such a treat to watch these 2 HOFers battle it out maybe for the last time.
Praying qanon rodgers have racist recorded tapes like mel gibson so the media an cancel him forever 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Right at the end, the officials should have called a delay of game twice on Tom Brady. But, this is a game where the defenses were equally up to the task and deciding whose offense would generate enough big plays to win this game. This was a clinic
So possibly the final time that Brady vs. Rodgers happens, and it's a defensive struggle. Well then.
Buc with the L 😂😂
Aaron rodgers is and always has been the greatest QB not Brady
Being a packer fan is dangerous, I have multiple heart attacks a game
As a Brady fan, just wanna wish Rodgers and the Packers good luck moving forward. Hopefully this isn’t the last time we see these two all time greats
this might be the last time these two QB’s play each other in a game
Hurricane hitting Green Bay and Packer fans lose their love ones please allah 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Nice I finally had Kevin Burkhardt for this one!
Pretty remarkable what both QBs did with rather horrendous pass-catching options vs really good defenses.
Good win for the Pack! Both defenses played like crazy! I have a good feeling this won’t be the last time we see each other this year
It’s still surreal that this could be the last time Brady vs Rodgers meet in the regular season, even tho I would want to see that rematch in the playoffs which that would be amazing
Two HOF’s Battle it out, even tho it was not a great game. A pleasure to see these two face off
TOM BRADY AND THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 🏴‍☠️ HEARTBROKEN 💔 😭
That's what you get for wearing white unis for a home game in football
Cool

Aaron Rodgers: *Embraces Brady* The North Remembers
TB 12 let’s goo
Brady didn't have any of his WR's and Green Bay only won by 2 points? Rofl! Not impressed. Rodgers is sooooo OVERRATED!   7 > 1.
Brady having 2019 flashbacks tho
First
