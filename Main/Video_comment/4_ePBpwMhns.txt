Amazing work Elon Musk, SpaceX and everyone involved! The more I see it, the more I want it! Prodigious Elon Musk I love you so much!
Thats amazing
Check out the portal thing at the 20 min mark, bottom left corner. Right before they cut away.... 20 min 28 sec mark it begins... Pretty weird... and they cutaway as soon as it came into frame
the white dots on left screen seems controlled 20:15 , suddenly they take a left turn and accelerate after they slowed down lol.

I don't think I've ever wanted a company to succeed as much as I do SpaceX.
Nice!
WTF
Hi, I am new to astronauts, I don't see any stars why?
This was really amazing!
next launch ?
INCRÍVEL  ,  ESPETACULAR
we love space x & we traveled to Boca Chica to see the starship get built. & we got the S dual motor fsd last Christmas 🎄 😎 still have the cybertruck tri motor or 4 motor fsd on order, i got lots of solar & backup battery system to charge them both. i have tsla too. i just got tried of paying $5 for a gallon of gasoline..
20:30 what is that in the left camera?  lower left corner?
20:32 what is that on cam one
I wish SpaceX continued success in its collaboration with the construction of Indonesia's new capital city in East Kalimantan Indonesia's development planning ministry said SpaceX or an aviation company from the United States was eyeing the new capital city of Indonesia to be used as a launch site for high-speed aircraft. It could be said that if Indonesia wanted to go to America, it could take 1 and a half hours or 2 hours.
Whats that white ring at 20:32 on the left cam
Congratulations Elon...
She is hot.
Surah Al Anbiya Chapter 21 Verse 30  Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?  Surah Al Naziat Chapter 79 Verse 30  And after that He spread the earth.  Surah Al Anbiya Chapter 21 Verse 33  And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.  Surah Al Rahman Chapter 55 Verse 19-20  He released the two seas, meeting [side by side]; Between them is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses.  Surah Al Naba Chapter 78 Verse 6-7  Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?  Surah Taha Chapter 20 Verse 53  [It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.  Surah Nahal Chapter 16 Verse 66  And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies – between excretion and blood – pure milk, palatable to drinkers.  Surah Al Alaq Chapter 96 Verse 1-2  Recite in the name of your Lord who created  – Created man from a clinging substance.  Surah Al Muminun Chapter 23 Verse 12-14  And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.  Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.  Then We made the spermdrop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah , the best of creators.  Surah Al Qiyamah Chapter 75 Verse 3-4  Does man think that We will not assemble his bones?  Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips.  Surah Nisa Chapter 4 Verse 56  Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses – We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted in Might and Wise
20:32 something is floating around the earth round thingy object of something
Go to 20:33 in re-enter go to first stage camera view then go look at left you can see a like ring then space X switch camera quickly
Já me inscrevi pra ver os próximos lançamentos
The US military is criminal because it kills the children and women of Yemen. And everyone who cooperates with the American army is a murderous criminal.       Islam is the path of truth.China is a criminal state that oppresses innocent Muslims.
what is that thing on the bottom left at 20:33 🤨
What was that thing flying in the left screen above the rocket at 22:02 ?
excuse me, is there alien?
¿Porque editaron el video y quitaron el ovni parecido a la nave de freezer que aparecía en el minuto 21:32? Yo entre el jueves 13 de enero de 2022 y claramente se veía en su video
20:32 what is that thing on the left camera down left? I think it’s just space junk
Congratulations  SpaceX  team.
Thank you for sharing beautiful and amazing good work lovely have a blessed day ❤❤💖💖
Just plain routine now. Awesome!
Wer ist wegen Kevin wolter hier
Del OVNI, no decís ni Pío!!!!? Cambio de cámara....
Never gets old. 2022 strong
En el minuto 20:32 se logra ver la presencia de un ovni es de los mismo que cayó en mi pueblo hace 4 años
20:30 ovni
20:32  Unidentified object UFO lower left
Well done Space X
I see the UFO people are talking about.. why did yall cut away from it? 20:30
A blight on the night sky.
18:14 thats where the Ovni say hi to us
Starlink is a dumb idea...
The deception is real
20:30?    20:30?    20:30?
Hello everyone I am a student and I am very interested to know about space I wanna go there it's my dream I don't have any back support so it's maybe my dream I wanna go to in space I wanna see how is space I don't care i will not come Back to home but I wanna go there😊
Whats there in 20:32 no one notice???
In the 20th minute there was a UFO but immediately the camera was deliberately diverted
20:33 hay un círculo raro ahí en la pantalla izquierda 🧐
20:30 far left corner A light ship (: they are trying to let us know they are here! Not sure why they switched the camera! We need more footage of these ships so people aren’t scared of them
20:31
guys please some body explain about the anomali appear on first stage cam,, during re entry at 20.33  because almost everyone in my country thougt that is a UFO,,   it is a cloud that form like an object or it is an unidentified object ?
20:31
Why is landing always in shitty quality? i mean pixels like it was 1990
Alguien puede explicar la cantidad de objetos voladores y el anillo que aparece al min 20:32 20:34 ? Y justo cambian intensionalmente de camara?
the eye rejoices seeing this
Land some of those satellites over Arkansas please 🥺🥰
Eu sou fã
It took 9 minute from launch to land a rocket,meanwhile it takes an hour while my delivery comes
Yo SpaceX, you need to figure out how to copyright these launch videos and prevent media from filming them. Media companies are shown before you videos as "Top News".   A single view ends up being worth around $0.18. Cutting traditional media out will increase your Media Content Revenue
What Happened at the 20:31 minutes? It is a UFO🤔 why changed broadcast?👽👽👽💫💫
Guys, we will soon switch to a 4-day working week and a 6-hour working day.
¿VIERON EL OVNI QUE APARECIO? En el minuto 20:33
20:30 left camera
They better hurry. 5 years. First launch in May 2019. That means they will need to start replacing old satelites in middle of 2024.
20:33 THE REAL UFO
Nice try huddin the UFO
Does anyone know what the ring shaped object is that appears at about the 2:30-2:35 mark?  It’s on the left by the fin.   I’m sure it’s probably associated with the booster somehow - but they cut away from it almost immediately and then back to the same angle after it has left frame?  I’m not claiming it’s the Millennium Falcon or Elon Musk’s uncle in his mothership - but does anyone know what it is?  Could be clouds at surface I suppose…but seems to tilt
I love Jessie, she's such a talented cutie 🥰😊🥰
Did someone else notice the spacecraft (UFO?) that flew by on the left camara on minute 20:30?
In the minute 18:55 .. an anomaly is observed in the lower left part, something flies by very fast
The music, the space ships, the ocean ships, the hosts, the cameras, the stream operators, the launch crew, the ground crew, the engineering teams, the production teams, the relaunch teams, everyone else that I can and can't see. This is so professional and satisfying to watch. Well done 👍🏻
are you seeing that thing looking like an UfO at minute 20:31?  For debris or ice it is moving to uniform (no tumbling)  Camera is in the shadow as well so for sure doesn't look like a lens flare
20:30 there is a space portal that opens  ive seen them before I cant beleive they ignored that
Hello sir I need some help
When stage1 landed, I was so glad.
101 booster recovered!!!!!!!!
20:31 ufo mothership 21:45 ufo spotted 22:01 another one
frim time to time, on the left screen can see stuffs zooming across the space
Já faz parte da rotina da SpaceX, mais é sempre incrível. Parabéns  a SpaceX 👏👏👏
20:23 ufo
ATENCIÓN....!!  BOLSAS PLÁSTICAS EN LOS MOTORES...?? To See ➡️ Min 18:00 en adelante...!! ¿¿ CREEN USTEDES ESO POSIBLE..??  SABEN USTEDES LO QUE ES LA FRICCIÓN...??

What is that on the left screen at 20:33 ? Kinda comes from nowhere then disappears  🤔
20:32...?

will we get VR experience of spaceX?
What is that moving thing in the sky? - https://youtu.be/4_ePBpwMhns?t=1242
Whats the strange smoke like ring at 20:32? You can actually see it form before the camera cuts away.
20:30 Wtf UFO
Congratulations SpaceX
I like how this booster carried Inspration 4.
🛸🛸🛸👽👽👽
So we are not going to talk about that portal thing at 20:33?
20:33 Que es eso en la  parte izquierda ?🤔😮
Great start to the year
Portal forming at 20:33 🤔 sketchy
En el segundo 20:33 aparece algo raro formando un círculo y después cortan la transmisión de esa cámara... y en el minuto 20:44 vuelve a transmitir la cámara y se ve volando o pasando un OVNI...
UFO??? 20:32 a ring
20:32 - 20:33 on the left, I love how the alien ship warps in and they switch to another feed.. uh huh..
Solo vine por el ovni del minuto 20:31 imagen de la izquierda
Jessie is awesome, crushes another livestream!
22:01 - a satellite flyby?
20:33 !!!!!    20:33!!!!!     20:33 !!!!!!
Que fue el objeto anular? Porque cambiaron de escena¿?
Why Space X make electric rocket.
watch that thing on the left bottom, on the left side 20:31
because they cut the transmission of the ufo that goes out to the left
Que es el objeto que aparece en el minuto 20:30 en la parte inferior izquierda de la imagen izquierda?
UFO at T+00:05:12 exactly into the whole launch, watch left screen left side of that stabilizer, they cut feed not long after it shows up.

Il y a une souris 🤷‍♀️😂😂😂
What that forming 20:33 ?? Bottom left of the screen.
What is 20:32 left screen below the wings any explanation?
Cool portal
20:32 wtf is that 'ring' that appears before the camera cuts away? Left screen on the left edge.
One more thing I wouldn't be surprised if God himself doesn't watch  the internet and everything we type yaheard ya nerd
20:30 a portal or something opens? Just before switching feeds, left screen bottom left.
20:30 bottom left  Wtf is that...
Great Elon Musk
Nice duplicated comments @Youtube ! Keep trying to cover it up, you’re making it extremely obvious and word will spread, you messed up
20:33 Space debris in left camera
Is the object that moves at 19 minutes and 18 seconds a UFO?
Hello 👋
20:33 on the left screen at the bottom left a large circular shape appears before the feed switches. It happens quickly so you’ll need to slow down the play back.
Elon gratulacje ;)
🧡
I love watching these launches and still remember the buzz i got when they first landed one...now i just expect each time that the launch and landing will go off without a hitch
what is going on with the camera switches that has the earth change positions but the angle of the exhaust cone stays the same.
What was that Space Portal Ring at 20:33?!? And then abrupt cut? Wierd
Don’t you love how they curve the earth lol the earth is flat full stop anyone who thinks we live on a sphere is wrong
No min 20:54 vc tbm notou um objeto se movendo? Uma luz branca
20:33, what is that ring that forms?  Bottom left corner
Can anyone please explain to me what the big ring floating up from below @20:31 is exactly?
i love spacex all&we love trump not biden/harris/stupid&idiot of turkey government.thanks alot we love trump not biden
I wonder if the work for the people at SpaceX has become just a routine job?
what the mission of starlink? can someone tell me.
Why do you never show first stage landings in full? In the end, it is always interrupted and bad quality...
Thanks to the Elon Musk (Ironman) for his technology👏
Amazing
Wat is dat ring thing @20:33
Ouçam Michael Salla Megan Rose Alex Colier Dr Steven Greer Elena Danaan  Laura E DEMIS VIANA.
Anyone care to explain WTF that was that appeared at 20:24? on the left video
Elon u know of the perfected machine pushed through time . I know the lie
Elon as high sky council on the appropriate channels would say bring it say my name as being in the same realm as your s admit to me Jason Cole Palmer as being the one u speak to with Lord  God and Bob or Sam which ever ur using man
Ordered Starlink 1.5 years ago. Still no delivery.
Good commentary
SpaceX: "It's Just rocket science."
Congrats!
*successful landing. not recovery ))
Uouu!! UFO to 20:34?????
Hey do u think we can hookup nd record holographs onto someone and record out their eyes and steal and harvest their thought patterns like individual thought patterned and duplicate
If we didn't have SpaceX we wouldn't have one of the most basic technologies in Sci Fi which is propulsive landing. Glad to know we've knocked that one down
i need a job spacex kindly help me
Starting count down from 5! Sounds so normal like an airplane flight. Awesome progress!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈

How much time guys you saw these lauches  We : Always....
Why no one captures and telecast Rocket launch or mission like this? Well done Space X🤓
Nice 🌈🚀🌈💝
This literally never gets old!  Congratulations SpaceX!
The entire SpaceX launch sequence and landing on the drone ship to reuse the booster is just amazing.
Did anyone notice something weird at 20:30 in the left video and then the camera cut away. 🙄
Landing super edited and they only give u a shitty upclose vid that lasts for a second.  I call bs!
Why does the second stage booster with earth behind it looks cgi?
Anyone else catch the wormhole/Stargate opening up at 20:33 ?
What is that ring that appears at the bottom of the left picture at 20:33 ?
That was amazing. Watching how Elon has revolutionised the space race. Could never get tired of watching this. Guy is the Einstein of out generation.
something above the clouds flies across the screen at ~21m46s. Was that debris or a high altitude aircraft?
22:00  Left Frame ?!?!?  What is this?   There's something accelerating in the upper atmosphere. It's not a litter in space, it's accelerating. It's like a rocket has been launched.  I think it feels like it's accelerating because of the angle of the lens. I checked once again.  Okay, fuel residue from the rocket nozzle of the vehicle. I became like an idiot.  😅
we really don't need to hear about the soot on every flight
I wonder what flew by on the first stage (left screen) at about 22.00...
22:02 what is that white sphere that wizzes by in the left?
*Request for the team - The coverage overlays Speed and Altitude during launch but it would be great to have dynamic air pressure/indicated airspeed to see how the aeroloads are changing during the initial launch and re-entry phases. Not sure if this is measured at all or could be overlayed?   -Love the coverage of these launches!
You can see UFO  at 20:20 minutes on the left of camera ,👍🏻. And other fast white object fliyng
Пнх, ибо дело уже до прямых подлогов дошло.. Не был не состоял. И глаз на ж*пе нету.

You are a ghost
1000th comment yay
👌👍
One of these missions will get fail one day.
👏👏👏👍
This was my first time watching a live rocket launch. What a success so far, the engineering challenges faced when taking on these complex procedures must be very intense and I can imagine why they celebrate at each successful stage.
Unbelievable. Did you see how shaky that camera? Still shaking, how dare SpaceX do this /s  Great job
Appreciate every effort these guys are making except the startlink satellites.  It has become difficult for other satellites to survive and especially astronomers on earth to observe the sky in conventional way.
This was my first time watching a live rocket launch. What a success so far, the engineering challenges faced when taking on these complex procedures must be very intense and I can imagine why they celebrate at each successful stage.
Max Q   well i guess when they thought about  Far Q     out of the Q's          ok   max
☹️Me thinking they were UFOs
My future job 😌💜💙
Поздравляю с успешным запуском Falcon 9. Поздравляю с  России👋
so much better than blue origin!
still waiting on mine! Can't wait!!!
What is it? 20:31
Another great job Space X People
did anyone notice this? 20:32 on left bottom, what was that?
Elon Musk is an American hero.  Amazing!

Always the same script, camera angles and cut offs
“Without question, this is the great mystery of our faith: Christ was revealed in a human body and vindicated by the Spirit. He was seen by angels and announced to the nations. He was believed in throughout the world and taken to heaven in glory.” ‭‭1 Timothy‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NLT‬‬ Human body(Jesus)  Spirit (Holy Spirit)  This is explaining the holy Trinity. Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to Heaven. Get right with Him today.
What is that cloud circle at 20:31 ? (Bottom left) Incredible light conditions 👌
What's that flying object at 22:02 on the booster return video??
Muito bom 👏🏼👏🏼
do these things only go over water ?..ps the bin bags need taping on better , they're flapping a bit there in the "vacuum  " of space :)
Musk is part of the elite pushing agenda 2030.
Weak. Such a waste of time and money
Whats that at 20:32?? its not what i think it is is it? Someone explain what it could be besides a ufo.
Wtf ufo on 20:34???
this is still amazing!!!!
What is that ring like object at 20:32 on the left, coming from behind?
BORRRRING
"This is something we can do TODAY.  Let me repeat that - we have the capacity to do this TODAY." Some Musk quote where he "over-promised" (not defrauded) thousands of gullible cult leaders. Everything is always two years down the road, but we're taking your money TODAY.
This was my first time watching a live rocket launch. What a success so far, the engineering challenges faced when taking on these complex procedures must be very intense and I can imagine why they celebrate at each successful stage.
15:23
Go ahead spacex!
Congratulations SpaceX ! Well Done.
15:22 here we go..🇵🇰
This is beyond amazing.
Dear, people  I know this is contrary to what has your interest at the moment, but I’ve come to witness to you the incredible mercy of the Savior and King Jesus Christ. If you have ears to listen or eyes to see, let me give you a grave warning of God’s wrath. The only Way to escape God’s wrath is to REPENT and change your lives according to that of the life of Jesus Christ and His blood will cleanse you of your sins and you will have eternal life. Times are perilous, God’s wrath draws near, and time runs out, I promise this will undoubtedly be the best decision of your eternity. Romans 6:23 KJV- “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” This video could never offer what Jesus does. Remember God whom created you.
15:21 saved you some time

How do you keep track of all the  sats in orbit, how do they detect and manoeuvre to avoid collision, is it automated or a manual redirection?

What is that at the 20:33 mark left hand side looks like a portal opened up
UFOs at around 21 minutes on the left image
love the fact that spacex always streams in 4k
it's amazing how now seens so commom for them to land a booster. You can hear a couple of cheers and...thats it  incredible
Great Work Space x
18:25 - watch left of screen - few ufo  left earth with MACH 30-50  speed....... 19:55 - bottom of screen - like 20 crafts change direction 20:32 - left bottom  - WTF is this ?????????
does spacex make laptops now?
Jessie is such a great announcer. :)
Incredible... Thx.  She did a fantastic job of narration!   USA... Musk... Freedom... Leader!   Thank You Musk!  Let freedom ring for good!
Imagine a heart from Space X
Its probably no biggie but why don't they clean off the soot after recovery, I don't think they've ever explained that part.
20:33 what is this ring below the Falcon 9 (left screen)
That girl is so fine.
Is that a Starlink for Alaska?
The take off is so clean.
Uk column news for truth
15:15 the guy was really excited for the lift off 😂😂😂
Great footage, thank you.
Congrats to all who worked on this and other projects; you inspire!
no deploy
what is on the lest view 20:20 is a ring coming up. you change the view immidiatly. please let us know whats going on there. thank you spacex
Fantastic! I hope my satellite is onboard this launch. Let's go Central Texas!!! Oh, welcome to Central Texas, Elon.
UFOs at 22:00
Hola a todos!! en el minuto 22:00, sobre la imagen del dispositivo que regresa a la tierra, se observa puntos anómalos que salen proyectados a distintas ubicaciones, alguien sabe que es?  Hi all!! At minute 22:00, on the image of the device that returns to earth, anomalous points are observed that are projected to different locations, does anyone know what it is?
Back in bussiness
Great touchdown and flight. I can't believe they can't get better footage of the 1st stage landings...
New year, New launches
It is amaizing, but at this point im like "Meh another one", like im watching a bus go from one stop to another, its just everyday thing. SpaceX did this to me :D
congrats on such a beautiful launch sweet freakin ride!
I am excited about the opportunity of starlink, My current ISP charges almost as much as starlink does for a speed that never goes above 14mbps download and 3 mbps upload, I miss the internet I had when I lived in the city.
Incredible, again!
I saw it in the Sky yesterday on my country, Chile.
17:01 - one of the most beautiful things I've seen lately. And welcome home B1062-4, we wish you many more successful flights)
Congratulations SpaceX! Lifting off and landing booster are incredibly marvellous! Keep going forward.
I saw the train from this launch tonight. Took my breath away. THANK YOU ELON.
Jessie is an absolute asset to SpaceX broadcasting and she can professionally hold it on her own without any co broadcasters! Well done on an excellent presentation.
What happens at 20:10 ? Small piece of lining??
Nailed it as always
Why can’t we see the landings in 4K
What are you rendering at this timestamp 20:30 on the left side of the screen before cam change? Increase draw distance in future videos ;-)
Starting at around 19:32 about 4 minutes and 8 seconds into launch there are some moving objects in the distance.  Space junk or something else?
The intro theme is *JUST AWESOME* 👏 please share artist and track if that is okay?
Great Starlink
18:27 imagine if that debris flying by hit the rocket
At 22:03, on the re-entry camera, you briefly see an “object” fly past the vehicle, it’s quite fast. Any ideas?
Whole rocket looks dirty like a well used airliner! 🤩
Wow. 🤯😁 Just, wow! 😁
Nice start, but all these satellites are becoming madness, but our time is a world of mad people.
It seems that they decided to start up the mission again. Let's see this year December WiFi speed
Come on SpaceX surely you can produce better video of the landing?
Absolutely solid performance, launch, landing, and coverage.  Wonderful work SpaceX is doing to advance the aerospace industry beyond just the tech.  Also, perfect bullseye on that landing. 🎯
Whats that visible at 20:31, left hand side of the left grid fin
One day, people will land like that.
Its just sad that they dont have more subscribers, i mean they are trying to get humans to mars
Just love Elon Musk! Hes wonderful 💯🇺🇸👍
There must be millions of these starlink satellites, they never seem to stop sending them up. I wish you would give the boosters names, these girls deserve it with 101 recoveries
Why do I have a feeling that there was a leakage from 2 stage smth around place where nozzle get fixed with rest of the engine ? Anyone seen it before ? (Seen on 22:41)
Nice
stay away from Tian Gong.
Congratulations!!!
what is that accellerating away at 22:01 at the left screen??
EPÁ! vosses teem que melhorar a imagem da aterragem do transportador! A imagem esta melhor mas ainda não esta nada boa!
Well done SpaceX. Thank you for continuing to broadcast these missions for us to enjoy!
News reader ❤️❤️❤️
More Covid to the people ... Musk is one of the billionairs who made a fortune on Covid. hmmmm
If Starship is reliable.  And I have heard that argument many times.  But, I still say that there can always be a place for a human rated low Earth orbiter that is as safe and reliable as F9!!!  After all it isn't all that expensive like the other reliable vehicle, Atlas is.
Wondering why is always problem to keep stream from drone ship with clear video? Are there some interferences from landing booster?
still waiting on my February 8th pre order... maybe open some cells in more rural areas here in canada.. starlink is not needed in towns/citys like where you are only activating cells right now
21:44 on the left view, who's that flyby ?
Why can't they have a replay buffer on the cameras? Get clear footage right after the landing sheeeeshhh
YAY!!  More satellites!  Watching via Starlink!
20:33 if you see on left side, you can notice the round shaped object what was that is that UFO?
Congratulations team and " To The Moon" 😜
Yep every mission is now fun to watch..  never gets boring to those who want to see a rocket go.
Awesome tracking shots
We can't place pre orders for starlink in Africa. Where it's needed the most
When is the super heavy launch?
STOP SATELLITE POLLUTION NOW! musk thinks we're living in a simulation - he has no regret for wildlife/biotopes around his launch sites and he has no regret for pollution in space
Love all things that happen in space, but hate starlink for polluting sky.
It would be nice,  from my perspective,  to get better quality audio/video for the landing.  That being said I'm fully aware my experience is not the priority.
The landing of the 1st stage on a drone ship never gets old. Absolute MAGIC! Well done to SpaceX Engineers.
Take that, astronomy! Ain't no one got time for fiber.
Jessieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3 My favorite caster!
GG!
First james webb space telescope and now this wow 😁 and also is that a ring 20:31
Starlink is the hope for many live in rural. Great job SpaceX
Когда гордишься более развитой страной и ненавидишь за коррупцию свою.
It would be amazing to see the first stage coming in to land from a camera looking up from the drone ship.
😮
18:25 on the left screen, what is that white object floating next to the grid fin on the left?
amazing progress!
Was the second stage leaking something near the nozzle or is it normal? I've seen many Falcon 9 launches but never noticed something like that before
Excellently
What is that at 20:33, Near to the left grid fin of stage 1.
Nice
all involved in this project and future projects, i love you all so much and i hope we reach eternity unknown. love you all so much, thank you all so much for your efforts and dedication to a deeper dream. i appreciate everyone & their effervescent efforts so very much. i love you all so much  ❤‍🔥🌍🥀🌎🥀🌏❤‍🔥
Rage rage against the dying of the light.
The other recovery vessel should be renamed to Jeb

Love this every time

😎🤍🖤
IS THAT A LEAK ? THAT GENERATED SOOT !!!!!
Great footage, congrates on another one, lovely to watch. Hopefully you can soon, place an SSD onboard the rocket and drone ship, that the on board cameras can record to and then upon landing download there videos feed over Wifi 6 to the drone ship for delay transmission via star link. In which you can then show a delay 4K feed, with no drop out of the last 40KM of landing, while the rest of the launch proceeds and then also post an updated archived video for youtube, which uses the footage that has no drop out on recording, as it should all be templated, just run tools again faster than real time to encode the video. ;-)
101 Dalmatians____That's how many it takes to row a STARSHIP! I know, l'm from the Island of Vis! In my next ten years,  l will place a deposit for a flight on S!VERBYRD to Mars!
NASA IS THE GOAT! Thank you to the people at NASA. You make America great again! Only morons would think otherwise! NASA IS THE GREATEST GOVERNMENTAL BODY IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. Bringing science to the American population.
SpaceX launches the rocket to lower orbit more often than my husband lunches his rocket to me 😂
Uhm, I always love listening to the space tunes and seeing the deployment and you guys didn’t show it this time. Bring that back please.
Keep shining and keep growing  Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Thank you so much SpaceX team and Jessica for the wonderful commentary. When can we expect service in Africa?  What's the bandwidth capacity for the new optic Lazer 2.0 satellites, if I am not mistaken the previous satellite version had a capacity of 20Gbps.
First Stage landing itself never gets old  Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations SpaceX.🎉
Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations
SpaceX, you Rocket 🚀 My Socks!!
i can hear you explaining all day.you are my fav after elon in spacex
love ya
No video of the payload release?
Landing stream is better but please make it even more so, please!  Thank you SpaceX for being awesome!! :)
great start for  2022!!!! Good work Space X
What is that on the bottom left that appears in the shot at 20:33
This is so interesting. I love it. I want to see it in, person 🚀🇺🇲🚀🇺🇲 #SpaceX
Incredible
Starlink 1st mission of 2022
can't wait seeing indigenous people doing tiktok because of starlink 😂
https://youtu.be/W_u3wkKNDdI  Такого еще ни кто не предсказывал про будущее России
It never gets old 🤩
Kazakhstan’s national network has been interrupted. Starlink, don’t let people be deprived of their right to connect.  哈萨克斯坦全国网络被中断了，星链加油，不要让民众联网的权利被剥夺
I love that we get to hear the booster sound this time, it makes it feel like I’m at the launchpad!
Thanks Jessica always know your voice after you speak two words.  Huge Congratulations SpaceX on another precise launches and recovery can't wait to the big one takes off wish every success on that watching Boca Chica everyday thinking of stowing away on super for the first launch BUT DON'T TELL ELON lol
We missed you Jessica :)
It's WITH County, named after George Wythe, signer of the Declaration of Independence.
I love to watch spacex
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW IS ALL THAT I CAN SAY! AND THE SPEED OF EVOLUTION IS MIND BLOWING! IM STILL MIND BLOWN WHEN THE BOOSTERS RETURN! 24:14 & 24:40 I'D LOVE TO SEE A LAUNCH IN PERSON! I LIVE IN FLORIDA MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL BE BLESSED ENOUGH TO SEE ONE!!!! WE'RE STARTING OFF 2022 RIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO SPACE EVOLUTION! CONGRATULATIONS ELON KEEP GOINGE
Илон молодец 👍👏👏👏 У батутного выходной, всё ещё новый год отмечает.
отлично!
The only reason I watch is to see the landings.........
Bravo SpaceX!
Why in hell didn't they have a camera system like this on James Webb???
Jessie's back :)
Great to watch. Thanks very much
It is too amazing
Starlink Philippines pls!
Watching lift off and then the booster rockets landing is always fascinating !
✊
Anyone else notice t5he leak on the M-Vac Turbo pump assembly? Could be a lense flare.
INCREDIBLE!!! i hope elon plans to make this electric that way would be 100% environmental friendly...
Wtf is that in the bottom left corner of 1st stage at 20:30  right before camera randomly changes to upward camera???
im unsure about the starlink project but the mission to moon and mars especially is extraordinary
bUt dA eUrFf fLaT
Please publish that droneship view uninterupted, it looked incredible, bonus if you add the booster footage too!
It's so great everytime
Uninterrupted Landing footage 🔥🔥🔥
At T+00:05:14 that is a neat cloud? smoke-ring just left of the grid fin.
Горжусь человечеством! Значит есть надежда! Переведите и передайте очаровательной Джессике, что разводить руки через каждые 10 секунд для ведущего - НЕ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО (отвлекает слушателей)!!!
Never ceases to amaze with the landing
This was my first in person rocket launch.  Absolutely incredible experience, the flames are soooooooooo much brighter in person and the sounds are AMAZING. Anyone reading this, get out there are see a launch in person, you won’t regret it!!!!!!
Let's also appreciate the camera team for such clear and beautiful video. #congrats Team space X.🚀
Liftoff is fun, but landings are oh, so sweet
Great camera views!
How is it with star link and such we always end up with a shaky visual on the landing.  You can fly rockets to space like I go get a gallon of milk... but we don't have the technology to get a decent visual of the landing... what's going on here?
This became so commonplace I rarely watch it live nowadays. Great way to start the year with another successful launch and the best engineer webcaster.
Get the soot issue; no need now to remind folk.
At 22:02you can see what looks to be a very fast object shooting by underneath stage one. Doesn’t look like space junk but looks to be propelled by its own power.
First launch this year.
Look at the birds at 19:42
AmAZING as always. 20:40, what do you think that object was moving across the skyline....?
Did anyone see the white thing fly by in the booster video @ +5:23 in the countdown? It would be @ 20:43 in the video. There was another one @ +6:43, 22:04 in the video that was going in a different direction. Im not sure it was the same thing but im curious what they were.
101 recoveries!! Wow! Thank you SpaceX for changing the world
Is this the one with the space mice?
I usually only watch these launches to see the landing lol :D it stays something impressive :)) shame the quality isn't that much better since the early launches, but I get that live streams aren't a priority at that time, but it has gotten better :) still such a beautiful thing should be watched with more detail ;)
❤️❤️❤️
Was fliegt bei 21, 40 und 22.0 min
no deployment footage? always an awesome feeling to watch every SpaceX launches and landings..
For me it's gotten a bit mundane. It looks exactly like every other successful mission. SpaceX has made this a routine thing, a great thing fyi.
Both fairing halves have been on MULTIPLE MISSIONS are you kidding me? That’s amazing….how the hell are they finding these so easily?
20:30 : W T F OO"
Dude said liftoff in a way that we may see the end of that tradition
Daytime good.
Question: What causes the "Craclkling" sound of the engines after launch?
Thanks uncle Elon!  This never gets old!✌😎🏴‍☠️
Congrats SpaceX  all of u there guys and Mr Ellon . That boosters are really amazing to see how it lands perfectly so cool!
I’ve been waiting for a long time to get my internet I’m excited
Awesome job SpaceX!  Did anyone see the round ring off the the left, bottom of the screen when the 1stage booster was making it's landing approach, pre final landing burns?  They cut over to a top of the booster after it was on view!??
Good job on the commentary!  Unlike NASA PAOs, you didn’t talk over the command nets needlessly or try to say something profound at the moment of liftoff.
With over 100 successful 1st stage landings, why still land on a ship vs back on land like the Beautiful twin landings that seem such a long time ago now?
They will teach Kids about Elon Musk and his Great team’s achievements in history books at school on Mars
What is that thing at 20:31 ? Left Image
Always watch it like the first time 👍🛰🚀🛸 Aw inspiring
Why no ground cover?
Safe to say you are getting really really good at this space stuff.
The only dislike was coming from Brandon? :)
Did anybody see in the bottom left 20:31 UFO 🤔
I love the coverage.  Would be great to see the acceleration and therefore the acceleration of the acceleration!  Physics and Math nerd, sorry...
Theme music...  https://youtu.be/BG6cdD_osNU
Go SpaceX!!! <3
More and more the launch of rocket is very simple with SpaceX... Congrats one more successful launch in new year!
The cool guys with rockets would i say
Well done once again Space X- and suck it Bezos!
I never would've guessed to see such a spectacle become almost routine when I thought of this stuff as a kid. It's actually amazing 👏
I want to know what was that ring structure floating on the left hand side of the screen at time index 20:32 https://youtu.be/4_ePBpwMhns?t=1232
Are they already launching Starlink v2 or still v1?
With all the costs considered, how much does SpaceX save with a booster re-use? Maybe averaged over multiple launches.
Oh boy! Another launch by SpaceX and appearance by Jessie. Love you! Don't worry Jessie, no proposals from me coming. I don't think that two engineers could make a marriage work.
This is so good for the planet. This is what mother nature intended. The next step in evolution is space junk around a lifeless planet.
Oh no missed the launch.
Cowabunga!
The government could never come close to the space related achievements of the private sector and SpaceX in particular with these nearly flawless series of launches and landings being clear evidence of this.
Justo lo vi pasar en argentina buenos aires una fila de lucez es increíble 😀😀😀😀😀😃😃
After watching <<Don't Look Up>>, you might be surprised to see just one rocket there to deliver 49 satellites.
Global cell service?! Took you long enough humanity.
No coverage? Can you not use Starlink?
21:44
Delete the first few minuets logo please, for the planet!! my player is burning fossil fuel and like many people I can't afford a power wall.
👍
Beautiful launch. And I like her comment. Very pleasant.
I like how I used to be amazed few years ago watching this  now it's such a  routine
What's the white ring that appears at https://youtu.be/4_ePBpwMhns?t=1232 , on the far left side of the booster view?
Just 64 years between the first rocket into space and now this. Not bad... not bad.   If only I was able to stick around for another 64 years, the things we'd see.
101st time it didn't get old
Which mission is this? What Starlink batch is this?
20:31 I see a white circle on the left side of the stage-1 rocket screen, what is that?
UFO at 20:32. Bottom left.
I'd really appreciate a second audio channel where I don't have to hear the primary announcer. I'd like near silence with the call outs and the interesting sounds I thought I heard this time, but were talked over. The announcer is only doing their job, and I usually mute it, but I'd like to hear the rocket and the call outs.
The DroneShip Camera could be improved - I know it's trivial thing, but still.
Watching these launches and landings never gets old. Glad to be tuning in via Starlink 💫 Keep shooting for the stars SpaceX!
if you guys think about it, these guys probably have 100 first stage boosters by now. it only costs them fuel and one engine for the second stage. making BANK.
When will Starlink be readily available?
To the liberty mutual theme: Shortfall of Gravitas! and Doug.
I wanna merry her, she beautiful.
@20:30 was that a UFO on the left screen left of the fin? Camera view then changed for a few seconds
Yep it always thirlls & amazes. 👌🏼
Just got my Starlink setup last week. Smoking fast internet. I'm stoked.
20:45 & 22:01 UFO flying over earth on screen it's really hard to see it but it's there if you notice it.
Imagine being the face of SpaceX streams as they start this crazy thing for humanity (and also be a cool engineer)
sea looks a bit clearer for this landing
Thank you for broadcasting your launches.  This will never get old.   It makes me happy to see real progress in space exploration.
You are doing amazing things SpaceX team, your achievements, with no doubt, will go down in history :)
You all are rocking
Starlink contacted me yesterday letting me know my kit was ready to ship!! Woot Woot!
What is the strange blue object in the sky on the left side of the screen ?
Another group of survellience satellites installed under the guise of "internet" satellites.  Nice.
This is stunning... I am speechless....
Amazing, like always. Thanks for always sharing this incredible deployment of engineering
We demand full and complete video coverage until all satellites are deployed 🙈🙈🙈
well done
Never fails to thrill
101 landings!? I watched every one!
Elon Musk is the GOAT.
Ms. Anderson do you know what is the Matrix?
Please provide a feed/video without someone talking over mission control.
camera glitching  at the most awesome moment of course :/
It is a pity that the video disappears at the most spectacular moment - landing.😕
Have you heard? At that time people will see the son of humanity coming in clouds with great power and glory.Mark 13:26 Believe in God's son Jesus today, repent of your sin, heaven awaits dont be left behind.  Love Y'all
What was that @ 20:30, just before they turned off the view on the left?
Why did they change the view of the drone ship?  That sucked.
Does anyone else notice the Stargate begining at minute 5:12?
At 22:02 we see a white speck crossing the path on the booster going down, I wonder what that is, satellite? Seem strange to me, the booster must stay below satellite altitude isn't ?
It's crashed?!! oh nooo
UAP 8 O'CLOCK 20:33
Outstanding!!!
This never gets boring! Amazing work!!
@ time 22:49 this is the first time I have noticed something misting (like a leak) from the top right view of the second stage engine. Does anyone here know what that was?
My goodness, the camera shots during launch reminded me of watching the Saturn V launch
What the heck was the big ring thing floating up from under Stage 1 at T+5min12sec?  @20:31 Never seen one of those before.  Did something fall off the ship? They cut away from it pretty quickly, and only cut back once it was off screen.
The camera always glitches out when the booster lands because Elon is breaking the Matrix.
Just wondering, on the second stage .. looks like there was a leak before the bell of the engine. Could be just the angle.. didn’t seemed to effect anything.. could be intentional ..  be interesting to know :)
Soon there will be an accident in space ( low earth orbit) . A million pounds of petroleum burnt in 3 minutes. Is this carbon neutral then 😝. It’s all nonsense . Why can’t we use this ludicrous amount of dollars 💵 to sort things out here. Not in the great vacuum of space. Typically ignorant and ultimately deluded stupid humans doing pointless things.
Awesome job Jessy, awesome job SpaceX!
Congratulations SpaceX! You keep moving the goalposts and raising the bar. Launch and booster landings are like clockwork now. Is that the new orbital launch tower in the background at 7:27?
😲
Spacex are soooo lame an gay
Has anyone seen a good view of the new satellites when they are being deployed?
101 successful first stage recoveries... Amazing. Never gets old.
Not deployed  lost
One again, the presenter talks over the mission control callouts. Doesn't SpaceX realize that only space nerds are watching these launches? We don't need someone talking over the callouts to tell us what a fairing is, what Max Q is. etc. Can't she just listen to MC in one ear and stop talking when MC speaks, then resume after? She is getting better, but please try harder!
Lookup my bumhole
Impressive and love it...now can you ship me my terminal so I can use it?
paid a year ago when do i get my starlink and you owe me money for interest on my money for over a year
Very Cool 🚀👏
I can watch rocket launches and landings over and over and it never gets boring. 😍
So good
Spacex, one of America's great treasures.
I missed it again. Darn. Always next time!
😍 Jessie on the callouts!
Instead of “never not” how about using the word “always”? Much nicer and betterer.
It literally makes me sick to think that we would ever give up on this historically successful launcher.  Starship is likely to become great in its mission, but in near Earth launches, especially with crew, this launcher should never be given up on!!!
Beautiful video...🤟🏻
never fails to amaze.
Great start to 2022!
Wow...just amazing. So proud and thankful. Congrats xoxo
Awesome job SpaceX
these perfect landings are getting boring ..................no
Final liftoff countdown should be given to girls, boys are poor at this.
++++++++++
101 successful returns of the booster rockets.  Excellent.
Yay! These are going into my orbit - where my Starlink dish is pointing!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😁
Awe inspiring eveytime.  SpaceX guys -with all these thousands of Starlink satellites, why is it still so difficult to get real-time video and data from your Phase 1 landers?
My dreams to be part of the operation to get to Mars so I'll be working hard and hope that Ill get in SpaceX
so cool
YEA!!!  👍😎👍
When Nibiru comes around again in 2024, all earth orbiting satellites will be ripped from orbit and scattered throughout the heavens. Some will be forced back toward earth, burning up in spectacular fireballs. Then our planet will be torn apart and all life destroyed. Some humans will survive... those being on spacecrafts en route to Mars.
what is the mission, is just a test?
when i started sailing 6 years ago, i wondered how id get good internet connection out in an ocean, the sat tech at the time was prohibitivly expensive. Gd job spacex, and thank you.
All rocket should launch in the golden hour. No more of these disappointing night launches.
Jesse - The best commentator for SpaceX…
22:02 what is that?
Great launch, and great broadcast Jessie!
Its Just incredible to see Jessica 🤣 Oh wait yes there is a launch 😋
Wow. Excellent work Spacex
19:44  Stage 1 telemetry, WHAT?
I need a cheap battery for my solar cells
wu tang ..
My Dishy arrived in late October and allows me to have GREAT internet in a very isolated area of Eastern Colorado.  Before I was limited to 5mb/s down and less than 1mb/s up for the same money as my Starlink bill.  Thank you SpaceX, thank you Elon!
Congratulations Elon/Crew!
3 2 1...meh  The LD doesn't sound very excited lol
Can not get enough of this company. Just inspiring!
Those landings never get old.
The recent JWST launch media/ video coverage pales in comparison to an "ordinary" starlink launch! Impressive, SpaceX! 👏
Nice CGI camera trickery, the earth is flat!!!! wake up!!!!
The future is now!
Makes rocketry like flying …..but it’s not!✊ to SpaceX  for human endeavour .
That's 49 steps to solving global warming, ending land based astronomy and putting Comcast out of business. It's a Win, Win, Win !!
I wonder what was going by at 20:43 to 21:00 on the view of the first stage?  Was that an airliner going by below?
we know what max-q is already!
20:34 About the soot. I wonder if most of the soot deposits come from the fuel rich exhaust from the gas generator?
I love how consistent you guys are these days with your first stage landings. Can't wait to see what Space X achieves this year, especially with Starship!
SpaceX Intro Theme 2:21 Start of Webcast 3:03 Engine Chill 8:19 Strongback Retract 10:54 Falcon 9 Startup 14:21 T- 10 seconds 15:10 Liftoff 15:20 Max-Q 16:32 MECO & Stage Separation 17:56 Entry 22:12 Falcon 9 Landing 24:01 SECO-1 24:22
The entire SpaceX launch sequence and landing on the drone ship to reuse the booster is just amazing.
This is new normal
Why didn't we get to see the deploy of the cargo?
Got Starlink late last Year and it’s one of the generational improvements to society they’ll talk about in 100 Years. Each launch of new satellites just makes it better. Thank you.
Fantastic no hard landing this time. Awesome.
Watching this thanks to my Dishy McFlatface.
Anyone see that Klingon Bird of Prey about 19:10? :)
So amazing to be looking at 39a and the huge tower that SpaceX has the honor to use the remnant of such a large and historic structure.  Even more amazing is that SpaceX has built a much larger and more capable tower and it won’t be the last.
I finally figured out what those clumps collecting on the upper part of the engine of the second stage are. There seems to be a pressure relief valve bleeding oxygen, I assume. The oxygen freezes at the nozzle, "drops down" and collects in the space between the engine and the big pipe that wraps around it.
Great landing spacex !
This is so routine they only bother counting down from 5 now 😛
Connecting the whole world! Amazing! Could possibly backfire but still pretty amazing
Wonder if the Chinese will respond...
I think stage 2 exploded after stage 1 landed. Because it lost all speed coverage and dropped 1 Km in altitude in a few seconds.
Have you ever took the time and realized the amazing feat that is going from takeoff to second stage landing in just under 10 minutes? 🤯
Congratulations, 👏❤️❤️❤️🌹
Lol UFO at 20.43 on the booster cam? Great launch again Space X. It just never gets old.
Imagine when StarShip with 42 Raptors, launches and deploys 400 Starlink satellites, then the entire ship comes roaring home. We might hear the phrase, "Elon, you are going to need a bigger barge."
Thanks Heartbreak
First launch watched over Starlink.  Can't wait for Starship this year.
I wish all that treasure had been spent on upgrading and refining Falcon/Heavy/Dragon XL. Merlins run so smoothly and reliably.
hii
space as usual. Jessica shinny as usual
Suggestion for landing video quality. Launch a small drone with high res steady-cam and long lens. Back off away from the insanity, but zoom the camera/lens in. Come on, Elon, we are greedy for spectacular presence on Of Course I Still Love you! Put us RIGHT THERE!
Nice launch SpaceX and thanks Jessie!
Go on space x one day i will their one day hope i will get blessings
Why are the landing view cameras always so bad and blocky?
I would pay to watch this without interrupting commentary and just hear what is actually going on.
At 20:33, what is the ring that you see floating just left under the first stage?
Booo! Pay more taxes
We must have had better technology in 1970 because this was wack. No video of actual landing. I'm calling bs....
Do Flat Earthers still exist?  🌎 🤔
That crackling sound at 38 seconds.... I want to hear that in person!!!
perfectly on the center
EXCELLENT 🙂👍
Congratulations on the achievements Elon and SpaceX crew, what was that blue light? I Noticed no one has asked that yet
22:01  firsts stage camera, what was that?
Is it just me or the landing just keeps getting smoother?
I bet every time Elon sees us marvel at his falcon 9 launches he chucles and thinks, wait until u see the true power of Space X once we achieve full and rapid reusability with starship!
what is that thing moving across the booster screen at 21:44
congratulations americans you enjoy the achievements of your scientists and we send you more scientists
WOW!  The curvature of the earth looks amazing at 23 mins!!!!
Красавцы!
8 months later I’m still waiting for my dish
Live long and prosper.
Next launch in about a week! I can’t wait for a Starlink IPO!
nice ufo at 22:02
Gorgeous camera work! And an excellent launch o/c.
GG guys!
I would like to know the name of the song that starts the transmission. Thanks.
UFO spotted @ 20:31 ? On the left side, what is that thing?
With my expected 'coverage date' of January 2022 (THIS MONTH!), every satellite deployment just stokes my anticipation!
One of these days we might actually be able to watch a complete landing without the cameras cutting out all the time. I thought this issue had been sorted obviously not
It is always good to see these launches,  and I am always thankful and impressed that you stream them. However could you include more of the 1st stage descending and landing please. In the past this footage has been wonderful to see.  Thanks.🙏
Brilliant
Where are all the Flat Earthers?.....
I am across from wise county VA over in eastern Kentucky, we still struggle for internet, it is hard for families to online school kids due to the low bandwidth, with a price of $120 a month for service for a connection barely reaching 3mbps download. Our provider Windstream say they have a plan to upgrade the cables from copper to fiber, but that has been said for 20 years. I have ordered two Starlink dishes for me and my family to use. Once they get deployed to our location. Hoping to receive the satellite soon
Jessie is the best! Thank you Jessie! :)
Go Spacex and go Alexandra! Great launch and great coverage.
Thank you Jesse!
Pitty we don't get to see high resolution video from the re-entry and landings, because I bet it is awesome to watch the whole way down.
This literally never gets old!  Congratulations SpaceX!
UFO 18:55?
"it's where the 2nd stage engine ignites up"  "visually confirmed on your screen" "you can visually see"  "it'll last about 20 seconds long" Is it me or is there some redundancy built in to the commentary today?
Is this the booster that has also launched 10 times before? WOW what a reliable rocket booster.
First stage landing itself never gets old
Landing of 1st stage never gets old.
In this point (20:30) We have something strange forming on the screen in the lower left corner of the first stage monitor. Does anyone know what can it be?
Welcome to Orbital Class Rocket Recovery 101 taught by Professor Musk. 😎 Just another day at work for SpeaceX. Keep making the "impossible" look easy! 👏🏻

Is the a UFO to force spacex need to change the cam?
20:30 ¿?
Watching via  Starlink Amazing Thank you every one at SpaceX
At 12:00, as the TE retracts, it looks like the rocket is swaying slightly. Never seen that before
In the future, we also get 4k live from the rocket through Star Link What a time to be alive
Crazy that now I just expect the landing to go off without a hitch! Awesome work SpaceX
No stream of deploy ? 🙁
Hehehehehhehehehe
portal opening at 20.31 on booster cam :)
UFO at 20:31
Flawless launch SpaceX..
Go starlink 👍💯.
not sure why they dont have cameras set a bit further from the landing site so the landing interference doesnt cause the video signal to get distorted.  This happens with almost every landing.  Would be great for PR if they could come up with a solution like remote cameras or drone footage.
I wish SpaceX more success in the future <3
This was my first time watching a live rocket launch. What a success so far, the engineering challenges faced when taking on these complex procedures must be very intense and I can imagine why they celebrate at each successful stage.
Con grats
POG
Happy New Year
Happy New Year SpaceX great start to 2022!
Nice. Shouldn't the rockets have starlink connection and nice crisp 4k telemetry? just sayin :) And shouldn't the barge.
20:12 Rat
Rocket launches have become very commonplace nowadays, Meanwhile at Jeff Bezos’s house…
Always happy to see Jessie on the webcast
Плохо знаю английский, напишу по русски! Ребята! вы лучшие! Ваши инженеры лучшие! вы делайте великое дело! Если-бы Сергей Павлович Королёв был-бы жив, он бы был горд вами! Ведь освоение космоса дело рук не державы, а человечества в целом!!!! Люблю Вас!
Feliz 2022 pra todos.
Nice 1st launch of the year! It nearly flew over my house in Merritt Island.
Definitely one of the most stunning weather-wise views of a launch ever! Well done, SpaceX//
19:26 left
What a time to be alive.
Good job Elon and to Mar and beyond
Glad I caught it live, saw it in my recommendations at T-2 minutes :)
Great! Well done, Elon and crew!
Why are they showing this today? When it was streamed 10 days ago
Congratulations SPACEX on another successful launch 🚀  Happy New Year
I want to colabe with elon musk
very nice
First comment!! Yahooo!  Congratulations spacex
Thanks for sharing.🚀🚀🚀
Happy new year to everyone at SpaceX and congrats on the first launch of 2022! Can't wait to see what this year holds for SpaceX!
15:20 T - 0
Never not incredible to see a booster land.
You can buy advertising from me)))
Happy new year, everyone!
💋
SpaceX kicking off the year with a great launch!
I love 💕 SpaceX!

Hello
Curious. Why did they cut the stream when it wasn't finished?
cool
Hi
Молодец Илон
Good work Elon and Crew
Congratulations to everyone at SpaceX
Woww SpaceX sempre a melhor 👏
Great launch!
First
