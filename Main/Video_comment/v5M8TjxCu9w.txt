holy forehead guy
How is ksi not thinking with that egg
Elite killing from Josh got 3 kills in one round to win the game
Sick video
17 minutes 😭 what a time man   Love the new runtime tho 🗿
idk how many months/years later but I am back here on this very video
Actually just need more
These imposters throw more than the survivors😂
At what point they thought Josh was good at this game? I've seen every single video of them playing and he is one of the worst in most of them
This would’ve been so funny with lazar
I love tobis and jjs bbc
12:15, 15:50 😂😂😂
harry on the thumbnail instant click
10:01 Istg, Randy is so funny
JJ needs to put the bandana back on
Josh saying how he’s all alone but literally could’ve voted Ethan and would’ve been fine 😂
ksi jumpscare at the start
Holy nine head
JOSH the unsung hero of this imposter game!
.zerkaa masterclass
A sniper's dream ........... He is beforehead forehead and after head
0:04 HOLY FOREHEAD
We used to watch less than 20 mins 😭
13:15 JJ 😭
Anyone here in 2025
Why did his imposter partner not call emergency for him? Yh JJ forgot and failed but so did his partner
7:32 i have been watching this vid since 2 years ago and i still cant realise what harry is saying righ there.
ksi is a fool
Jan 22. 2025
3:49
My third leg is more of a monster ❤❤
Whose watching this in 2025
14:15
I miss these more simple among us vids
I actually feel bad for tobi, AND ESPECIALLY VIKK with his MOUTH cannot stay QUIET for a moment. His arguments till now videos are not useful
Who's watching in 2025?
3:25
2025
what’s happening??
Who's watching this in 2024?
omg its too big, my eyessssssssssssss
Jj forehead covering my screen😢
Anyone here in 2024 ? 😂😂
JJ's forehead remembers what happened tomorrow 💀
Jj your forhead
The named You:
Aww I feel so bad for Tobi, they always speak overhim
brooo his fore head, nahhhh
JJ needs to stop self reporting hes not even trying
JJ's forehead jump scared me
2:40 playing with too many pokemon cards Randy has
Tobi - I haven’t gotten anything but crewmate it’s so boring 7 mins later - I love being crewmate it’s so stress free
What happened? I was distracted by JJ’s forehead
harry is op
ive never laughed so much at a video man 😭😭😭😭😭
Randy was really likable in this episode.
Don't invite randy to sidemen among us
10:01
Is it just me or does JJ get imposter in every among us video that they have postered
anyone in 2024
Sidemen actually made it from nothing man crazy. Simon is mr beast minus the psycho allegations
14:27 "yEsSsSssssSs🥴🥴🥴🥴"😂😂😂
Why is this video so glitched out
Tobi is always crying
Zerkaa COOCKED!!
Seeing ksi fourhead is bad
Tobi has no passion
Ksi forehead is shining wow
11:09 lol how did jj go to accusing tobi then 11:15 accusing josh and then 11:17 wanting to get voted out omfg
I watching all the sidemen among us videos and this is the first time I’ve seen Toby want to be the imposter
11:07 The issue is no matter how loud Toby gets, his voice’s frequency is soo low that it is undetectable and blends in with the other voices!
bro tobi is such a cry baby i literally cant stand him
Im rewatching all among us videos and yeah Josh was never good at among us
Wtf where these so short for
Tobi: Maybe I'm destined to be boring in this game! I don't get impostor! Tobi when he gets impostor: Why lord? Why must you let me suffer? 😂😂
It was Randy masterclass
it was Rany master class
Randy was on it this video
Forehead
The way Jj forgot to vote omg.. Anyone in 2024?
Tobi is such a b
Turn to Jesus and Repent of your sins 🙏 Amen
😂❤
Tobi: "I love playing with my friends" Also Tobi: "WHY WONT ANYONE LET ME SPEAK!?"
Tobi deserves all of this love 🤣 he is an OG
that forehead is mad
16:05 did anyone else hear “he came in there through the vent”
this is the most brainrot video I’ve ever watched
Why is no one talking about joshes triple kill
HATE TO RANDY
10:15 13:27
this episode actually pissed me off
Tobi is such a little bitch it’s unbelievable. How he is in the sidemen I don’t know.. diversity hire?
14:21
13:25
Me and JJ hairline go wayyy back
14:20
That freestyle just shows Ksi has a ghostwriter because man that was garbage
Everyone looks washed compared to this year
This title is the same as saying "Sidemen among us but it's Sidemen among us"
The title is basically half the players every among us game anyway 😂
"Let me talk"
JJ has no respect for anyone but himself, loves the sound of his own voice, can’t he just shut up and let someone else talk for once, doesn’t help his voice is annoying as fuck
Yo it s vik ok?, he is way more skinnier now.
Is everyone just going to ignore that sus sound Ellum made😂 I fxckin died when I heard that😂😂😂
Ksi jumpscared me at the beggining of thr video
Josh was so fucking good at this game, he's a stinker now
14:26 impeccable tobi
Man tobi has such a viktim mentality
“STOP CALLING ME MINIMIMTER😂😂😂”
11:56 did anyone notice that when vik was doing card swipe, in that wallet there is his proposal picture
Lmfaoooo
0:08 holy hell, get that man a hair transplant
Zerkaa is hosted 🐐
Why is no one letting Tobi speak
LMAO unlike everyone else, I don't care for Tobi at all and smiled everytime he wasn't heard. Get some bass in your voice my guy lol cringe ass yell and laugh. 😂😂
Poor Tobi 😂😂😂  Also Randy is just too good at this game
A
4:56 spoke like a true black man.😂😂 Jk don't take it seriously
if you like my pfp, like this comment.
Idk how Ethan enjoys being a crewmate because he literally throws every single game
You should make everyone imposter and the title screen only tells them that they are the one imposter, so they’re just convincing other imposters that they’re innocent
Since when is mega mind in the sidemen?😅😭
Yooo
😂😂😂
It’s weird not to hear JJ imitating the „Nobody was evicted“ sounds
Josh fuckin throwing
You gotta increase the input level of your mic Tobi.
Bro that forehead is mad
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
Ksi has a big ass forhead
Why is JJs screen corner blurred
Jj: I don't know how to describe it, it's not nav, it's the opposite of nav" Randolph: "van" HAHAHAHAHAHA😂
i put this on the r/funny subreddit!
Petition to not let randy join cuz he kinda annoying icl
@taha
The opposite of NAV  Randy:”VAN” 😂😂
Vik is such an NPC and he's annoying but he's harmless so it's fine😂😂😂
Will there ever be an episode the sidemen don't curse so much 😊 I'd be happy. Like just make content without always using f word that would be neutral for all to feel comfortable watching thank you 😊
Jjs brain is smaller than a peanut
jj’s forehead is maaad
Bro I feel bad for tobi
Why can’t jj just shut his mouth and let others talk ffs always wanting all the attention
Randy: body on the floor  Tobi: well it's not gonna be in the sky is it  LOOOOOL underrated comment
Absolutely NOBODY likes or wants Tobi in Amoung Us videos. Completely a waste of space. Imo
JJ, coming from a guy in his early 20s who is also balding, shave that shit off. You will feel a million times better!
12:33
10:30
10:27
4:34 JJ shoulda said “I’m not the killer, Randy your fat and you need to get thinner”
randy legit looks like a cute hamster
I actually cried when tobi quitted
I feel bad for tobi
OK I didn't think ksi forehead  was this bad
Why did the video go black ?
Tobey wanna speak up, but whispering at the same time. You pressed at anything way to quick mate.
4:35 WTF
Someone wanna play among us add me pls
vikk looks a bit chubby here
That second round was the most chaotic round I've ever seen
3:50
4:35 how does this guy  have music videos and Randy doesn't.  Should be the otherwise round.
10:27
Tobi such a pick me whine more
How many
Me Before: I have no salt for my food Me watching this video now: now that is quality salt right there
14:05 ohh hell nah
kick vikkstar out of the sidemen, in will dislike every video until he leaves!!!
Tobi deserve that he always D ride simon even if Simon don't give a FCK about him
Cry merchant
Randy's joke opposite of Nav "Van" was criminally underrated
Jj is too funny😂
2:53, 14:20
Jj i soo dumb bruv
Why is ksi hairline pushed back😂
Josh Is elite. much love zerka
Randy was something different this video 😂
Insane josh play in last round, three kills and w
Poor tobi man
so bloody frustrating to see Harry and JJ play man 😑
16:40 W zerkaa
elum selling
Tobi needs to get a new mic asap
No one talking about JJ’s forehead being out.
11:34 I feel so bad for Toni bro tried his hardest
14:21 iconic.
.
No what Randy?!
Hahahaha Tobi is such a sore loser
I literally said AWWW when Tobi says “I do have fun with my friends 🥰” at 3:06
For once randy didn't do something dumb
they do need to let each other speak.. thats just obnoxious to have sus thrown on you then not be able to defend.
I thought Ksi was wearing a brown bandana but it was his forehead
jj said opposite of nav and randy said van lmao
Tobi was definitely muted that round
“Sweet asshole”😂
I hope when they finished recording they realized that they spoke over Tobi so much that he started shouting and asked how he was. ❤
Nice acting
I feel like tobi needs to start hurling insults around like: “shut the fuck nonce-star123” before the boys will start listening to him.
7:45 Vik won't do it for less than $500. 😅
Vik shakes his head like typical Indian while talking tilting left to right
3:58
Tobi is a cry baby😂😂
Tobi went from 'I do have fun with my friends' To 'I just want to say one fucking sentence!' In less than 5 minutes
bless tobi honestly
16:06 I always love when they sound is used lmfao
JJ forehead😂
JJ with the wham forehead
Clown
Why do I hate randy
I BEAT YOUR GOING TO KO JOE F IN =THE 2 ROND
Tobi is so stupid bro, Instead of saying "let me speak" He should just shout "im the engineer".
8:50 the game hates Ethan
No one is talking abt Ellum's random moan
Tobi really sold it and blamed everyone else… mannnn disappointed in the accusations
jj shouldve kept his bandana on
8:10 when will ethan understand that he is still far from becoming a man
3:04 so gay
‏‪2:56‬‏ jj saying "shut the fvck up"
Jim spelling impostor wrong in the video title 😂
16:55 "toby don't take it personally man !" LOVE IT
Here is your free EPILEPTIC warning
JJ Please Shut the fuck up 😭 You’re interrupting everyone just to say things nobody cares about anyway 🤣 I feel bad for Tobes
1st Game, Randolph literally carried Crew Mates to victory. 10/10 Smooth Gameplay Randy
4:30 😂😂 10:26 😂😂 11:17 that massacre 🤣🤣🤣🤣 13:28 facts 😂😂😂 14:22 😂😂😂😂
1:23 this pic crazy
Its nice to see that JJ sacrificed his forehead for this video
0:08 Jesus help me. Is jj fuckin bald carouse damn his forehead bigger and smoother than my baby
I love how at 3:40 Randy know who both impostors are
I cried when the video opened up with JJ big ass forehead
Tobi bro, if you want people to hear you, you need to have your mic facing towards you and not the ceiling
13:24
Josh is either the smartest or the dumbest, there is no in between
Josh😂😂😂 14:22 and vikk started dying😂😂
unfunny
"JJ:- it's not nav but opposite of nav randy:- VAN"  ~ Quotes of 2023
Tobi isn't mad because he lost. He is mad, because he is dealing with stupid people.
I am not the impostor i would rather eat you paster
JJ was so bad this video and Randy was spot on
10:27 I felt Simon's pain Stop calling him miniminter🤣🤣🤣
I miss seeing KSI’s fat head
tobi crying way too hard, someone get him his pacifier
Thank you guys for making us laugh.
Randy’s teeth are the colour of vikstars player
That’s sad how Toby couldn’t even speak Harry and Simon need to shut up
I have a limit when vik speaks, whenever he talks too much I can’t handle it and get vexed😂
absolutely love that JJ got voted out for having a worse freestyle than randolph xD
I hope jj puts his bandana back on
Jj: its not nav its the opposite of nav Randy: VAN Icant
4:34 bro I ain't even lying, I had the same line in my head
Anyone else just hate Vik ? Not a dislike, like a strong hatred ?   No I’m not a racist, Tobi is my favourite sidemen.  If there is a Tier list right   S) Tobi, Harry   A) JJ, Ethan, Simon  B) The Cameramen, the Staff, makeup artists etc   C) the Usual group of friends to join the Sidemen   D) Mr Krabs Perpetual haemorrhoids  E) Vik and Josh
Tobi is everyone's main target to throw sus on to
I LOVE JJ but man your hairline looked off today 😂❤
Tobi the victim
the rare occasion of seeing jjs forehead just reminds me how clapped it is
13:18 i cant stop laughing😂
14:20
"shape-shittah" the funniest
simon is so stubborn
Tobi such a cry baby talking about people not letting him speak, you’re a man speak up on your own instead of needing permission
Opposite of nav Randolph : van 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like this style of among us it's more entertaining then any other kind. It's just funny as hell
❤
11:25 maybe if Tobi brought his mic down he would've been heard 😂
12:29 funniest moment of the video lmaoo
Tobi and his crying vagina
I LOVE THE SIDEMEN (especially harry because he is hot) 🎉🎉
I feel ya tobjizzle
Toby crybaby
JJ never knows what's going on😂
Zerkaa coming in clutch in the end😂
I found it funny how Behz went on a rant about how prefers being crewmate over imposter and then boom, He's inposter🤣
3:28 "pause"
No wonder jj wears a bandana all the time :/
a whole jumpscare in the first 5 seconds of the vid. that forehead is hella shiny
fr wanted to deck smn when tobi couldn’t speak
1:00 he was killed by jj in that exact spot last time
If JJ didn’t report Bez’s body and just vented out then harry could’ve killed Randy, and they could’ve gotten awake with it.
JJs head is so majestic 😂😂😂😂
Vick is always imposter and Tobi never is
2
KSI's forehead became imposter before him
JJ's forehead is so big lol
clean 1 from randy
Them not letting Tobi speak really pissed me off
Randy sucks
Idk like when the sideman play among us they always say it's either me or someone else?
Tobi’s laugh when Randy asks JJ to rap 😂😂
nnn yis
I never usually comment but i felt tobi's painnnnn trying to talk over everyone 😭😭😭💀
I’m a simple gal… I see harry on the thumbnail and I click
Bro ksi has a massive 5 head
Toby is sooo salty
Happy new year 1st comment in 2023 not that anyone cares 😂
Amazing how in the last game jj was third imposter but josh was 9th crewmate. Josh always be throwing his imposter teammate under the bus
10:02 LMAOO it is kinda a glitch so it’s valid but he mixed everything up😂
Never would anyone have thought that a kids game could have been a game for grown men... wait never mind this is the sidemen.
9:58 randy underrated joke
Bro JJ has a big forehead 😭
10:20
lol
Can Stephen play with you guys it would make me so happy
3:28 4:34
Poor tobi can't even talk😭😭😭
14:20 I'm literally crying bro😂
JJ doing download as oxygen depleted 🤣
שכ
14:23 after JJ, VIK has the funniest laugh
how is jj a rapper but can’t freestyle for shiy
Josh’s alone imposter at the end was underrated
When tobi yells and gets mad it ruins it for me bc like i feel as though its a moody mad not a trying to be funny mad yk
Tobi's microphone is up..
Honestly it annoys me how dumb Josh has gotten at this game
jjs forhead though?
JJ's arguement are hilarious, it's always just "how can I be the imposter again"
Okay randy!! Impress me🤣🔥🔥
14:21
Wtf ksi four head is massive It just keeps going
10:01 underrated joke lmfao
Ellum be Like nnn yes
11:08 *Poor Toby*
JJ is beyond stupid
Please tell me I’m not the only one who noticed jj’s voice crack at 2:32
I really like Tobi's sneaky laugh always 🤣🤭
Vik still bugs the fuck out of me all these years later just can’t help get frustrated listening to him
no cause i hate when people speak over others like if you’d be quiet you could’ve figured it out 😭
10:10
KSI: “Opposite of nav”  Randy: “van”  *Noone gets the joke*
Jesus Christ Loves You ❤.
Make sense big Josher gets imposter with not Ethan but yea I know and yes me going back to fix yea knowing I would say it and mention it going back I know
Bro said no to 150 pound for a among us game?
/
i reallt dislike Randy
Ksi's forehead looks massive today
Just Vikstar talking like that I know
Ahh fats killed I know
That edit at the end of the video of "It's only a game" it's completely uncalled for, Tobi is absolutely in the right to complain.
At this point that doesn't even count as forehead 😂😭😂
12:34 NO!!! You ****!!!
Huge forhead
Bro the funniest video idea would be to have noise limit on the loud peoples mic’s. for example JJ, so whenever he starts to raise his voice, he goes mute, so he can only talk at everyone else’s level
I feel bad for tobi
Zerka grieving over the loss of scientist Harry right after killing him 😂😂😂

can someone eplain the tittle of the vid?
JJ is fkin dumb. Ellum was with him the whole time. Why isn't he supporting him? Just keeps accusing other without proof. Why not kick out the one, you have now.
Can we just admire KSI'S huge forehead
Privilege life they have
Van
never gets old watching back these among us videos hahah
Josh Zerkaa masterclass....Josh is so underrated in among tbh
reeeeeeeeee
I’d rather eat ur pasta 😂😂😂
Being quiet waiting to know I would say it I know
Does jjs forehead have its own mall. That thing is bigger then the sun.
I only have one thing to say…..          OMFL JJ’s HAIR LINE
Yea no I think it’s GG and Josh I know
Who edit I know
Where did you go after you were with Wlluk I’m nav getting out to say it earlier I know
Ellum in slow mo replay is gold <3
1:10 this is why Tobi is the best
11:17 de bruyne be like
Anyone knows the name of the background music that plays at 15:05?? It reminds me of pokemon mystery dungeon or pokemon black and white entralink theme
Tobi gets so emotianal🤣 it aint that deep bro🤣
yo Randy NEEDS crest whitestripes BADDDDDD. only one with stained madd yellow teeth
JJ's forhead tho
JJ's forhead tho
JJ's forhead tho
Tobi should just max out his speaker/ mic or whatever cuz he is never heard bro
you guys are so bad at this game it's actually painful- it actually hurts
6:27 HELP
They should play "the other roles" mod ........the absolute choas and confusion would make a godly video
Randolph is always suspicious of Ksi and Toby definitely a subconscious racist.
Test
Bro I feel for tobi
Randy was an impressive investigator for that first round. He knew EXACTLY what was going on and knew about the potential double-kill too.
Feel bad for tobi
Everyone: Let KDB talk Me: Let Tobi talk

NDL

3:36 press and pause
JESUS IS KING

I was gonna say this earlier I know that Harold wiukd kill tobi and vent I know that Randy would say it’s exactly how I said guys and say I was with you the whole time and rest I know but I don’t want to say it I know
12:44
I love the intro, props to the editor
Tobi is a USELESS host-PART-2 https://youtu.be/Ha58C6y4d8A proof
Does anybody else think randy looks like the rabbit off the new minions
MINIMINTER
GOD IS GOOD ❤️🙏🏻 GOD loves you ❤️💕
KSI's hairline looks like it'd be the punchline for a family guy joke
Who is the owner of sidemen and moreSidemen or do they all have access
BRO I just pressed the vid randomly and saw jj face and I was intently like ayo is jj bald then I realized it's his forehead XD
i just clocked the first 10 seconds has the playstation 5 backdrop when u turn it on
Get that KDB clip up for Tobi. “LET ME TALK!!!”
WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS
I know everyone would go crazy I know
I know Harold would say I was with you Simon snd Randy then you left I know that he would say no you ain’t girthing money and I know that Randy would say that it’s exactly how I said it guys and say that I don’t know how to back myself here I know
I know that tobi would screen and that he would laugh and that  he would laugh and see him vent I know that Harold would kill tobi and that would happen I know
I know that they would mention especially Simon say where did you go after you we’re will Ellum and then he would say I dident see abody by the way I was gonna say that It’s you and I know I that whenever he said I dident seee a body so it’s abcuiosly him I know
tobi 😭😭
I thought for a second they edited jj’s forehead to make it look bigger
Yo Toronto,  I'm buying a unit for $2m. Fully free films ids the courpouratioun that printed the mouney, and the pouwer to print mouney must beloung to the peouple.
Who's here September
Oh mannn Tobi I feel youuuuu I hate it when people talk over me
This is the only sidemen content where catastrophes strike.

While tobi was yelling he dident even realize but he spotted I know
I know that Ethan would get imposter next with big Josher because of how Ethan just said what happened before I know but I called it that he would get it next I know
Why is randy so annoying?
Harry would not pay money to anyone since he hates paying money for charity.
It’s vik, he doesn’t shut up! Even went closer to the mic! Practically chewing it
Should I kill myself or keep living?
Tobi needs to get those mics which literally turn off when they get like 500 percent volume
To restore tobi's rights to talk,  use #rightsfortobi on all social media
Josh 🥶🥶🥶
Tobi is USELESS https://youtu.be/QlwmGLM1S9A
4:35
Randy saying Van 😂
Love the intro😂
Jumpscare in the beginning
JJs forehead could act as a solar panel
1:20 bit jealous
tobi is such a baby
“Only £50” had me dying
Tobi kdb let me talk vibes😂
6:24 14:21
KSI brain don’t work well in this game
Anyone going to talk about Jj’s forehead
Randy masterclass
2
Bro the whole time i was looking at jj forehead
JJ said opposite of NAV and Randy said VAN.
feel tobis pain
Tbh they all spoke over Tobi so I can understand his frustration even though it is just a game.
I'm a tobi hater, but feel bad for tobi this game
i swear jj's forehead is so big might as well count it as another player                             This is a joke -_-
what is the name of this song , in last?  , Mann I can't find it. 🙃
shape shiter
as soon as i see the forhead i went to the comments and found a comment talking about his forehead:/
Ellum almost said the nigerian feller's name at 14:21
Randy is so annoying. It's insane
Jj never explains himself
LMFAOOOOOOO bro ksi’s forehead is fuccin hugeee
What you mean you think
Ethan of course it was Harold and KSI
I had a few prime was going to kill Ethan I knew it
You know when he said he went to where Ellum is they should have known that’s where he killed him
I noticed that when KSI killed Ellum he turned gray a little before he killed him
Brooooo Jj’s forehead is massive 😂😂😂
Is it a solar eclipse or just JJs forehead
Bro JJ's forehead
I'd love to see sidemen play dbd
No one’s gonna talk about jjs mad forehead😳
Sidemen: only £50 isn’t worth it  Me: I’ll do anything for fifty 🫠
JJ's forehead.... Oh My God
JJ’s forehead scares me
10:08 LMAOOO
4:30 tobis laugh 😂 "jj you freestyle why it's NOT you then" 😂
Tobi🤝 Kevin de bruyne "LET ME TAAALK"
Ellum is like dont kill me and he does but Simon must know because he left them two at navigation
Tobi needs jschlatts funny mic to be heard
Poor 🦶🐝
Necesito hablar contigo urgentemente.
Get randy off man he’s so cringe and takes it too seriously
How has nobody noticed that Simon and jj's forehead is almost the same size
Holy f, isnt anyone gone talk about KSI s hairline 😨
Ah forehead 🫣
Ayyeoo Poor Tobi, He's Just Trying To Speak
harry bribing randy is soo funny
Daddy dingklebottom?
bro ksi’s forehead is massive
Yoooo, Jj's forehead is insane in this video
Poor Toe B
u cant throw me off with jjs forehead that quick at the beginning
Somebody call the police, I think JJ stole some of my forehead
Why is he mad? His name is spelled miniminter so I would think it's pronounced mini mint er and not mini miter
Bruhz lol I understand why people don’t play this anymore look at how randy was ass kissing jj and Harry In the first half bruhv that’s so boring I see why no one gets killed much they all butt hug besides Ethan, jj, Harry, Tobi  everyone else you hardly see em then bam you get a good one but then once someone gets killed they all ass kiss besides E,jj,har, and some times tob this why they’re always the ones mostly dying in these
JJ's forehead 🤣🤣
3:41 that "hmm" sounds so guilty🤣🤣😂😂
Jj is BALDSKI🥲
JJ forehead man
tobi is beta
My blood is boiling after how dumb these yutes are
you'd think with jjs forhead he would go big brain mode lol
JJ forhead is so massiv wen I Look at it i think  it is exploding with that Vein 🤣🤣💯💯💯💯🤣🤣🤣
You guys should do a lobby where everyone's names are different colours. Or map room names. Would make things complicated 😂
You guys should use the rule. Once u have voted. You cant ask questions anymore.  Makes it really intresting jahahaha
I feel bad for Tobi
Nobody talks abou jjs forehead ? 😪
The way tobi said ah i love playing with my friends
a forehead destined for greatness
maybe jj should do what jidon did ask people if they’ve seen his hair line and put posters everywhere😂😂
@0:09 Jesus christ
Petition to make JJ buy a hairline and beard for vibes
I feel for tobi
broo im getting angry cause jj is so fking bad
look at that hairline fame
13:22
It’s so weird jj not having a bandanna on
that fivehead is massive
Bro tobi was on mute💀💀
The pain of seeing jj without a bandana is excruciating 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Bro the way Randy went detective mode and picking out Harry and JJ as imposters. He’s a lot smarter than people give him credit for!
Poor Toby can't get a chance to talk with every bloke blasting over him
Hi
tobi being butthurt over a game of among us with his own friends is just so cringe. he takes himself way too seriously.
Harry when he got imposter in the beginning  "Who is it me and JJ?"  While it still shows him and a black screen
Can we admit Josh A.K.A Zerkaa is the best imposter of em all.
FUCKING SPIT MY DRINK WHEN SNOOP SAID “who”
Ksi dumb. Wish i chould play this. With this guys. I whould have gotten throw out cus of to much talking. And facts
that forehead my eyes
I have a better title. “Sidemen among us but nobody knows what the hell is going on”
can randy just stop talking so much he is just ruining everything
JJ’s forehead is MASSIVE 😂
everyone else: he's suspicious randy : he's suspect
"it's not nav but opposite nav"  *"van"*
Had to wear glasses for jj's forehead 💀
Brooooo the forehead 💀💀💀
Vikk sweating is such a hindrance wtf
Harry’s so terrible at this game it’s actually endearing 😆 ❤️  6:19 🤣
✨only 50 pounds✨
13:22
14:12
I clicked the video and played first 20 secs i screamed i never knew JJ's forehead was that big
I am a crew Yeah this is true I would never do no sussy moves-what jj should have said
the garden angel in among us does nothing in the sidemen
Vik is very rude and disrespectful. Vik is very overrated and i have request that kick vik from sidemen please. Take someone else where it can be beta squad or other. Thank you sidemen.
So frustrating how they always do visual tasks next to each other and they don't even see it 🤦‍♂...  When doing asteroids, the ship literally shoots laser beams in weapons. Anyone close by can see it. When doing the trash, a door opens outside of storage and the trash goes out. Anyone close by can see it. When doing shields, some lights just outside the ship come on. Anyone close by can see it. When doing medbay scan. Anyone close by can see it.  Crewmates, step up your game 😂
Jesus loves you all and don’t say the Lords name in vain
a
Tobi is such a crybaby
Tobi needs to dry his tears, bloody sook
Never seen a worse lobby
Randy did well here in this first round of this video
feel for Tobi,Tobi feels the same as Kevin de bruyne !
6:40 lol
Is it just me or is the forehead bigger
JJ,s head is huge
they needed to shut the fuck up so much when tobi was speaking
Tobi just not it anymore not funny doesn’t bring anything to vids anymore
I think Tobi mic is bad it was muted
No wonder tobi get pissed with among us
not tobi getting mad at freaking amongus lmao
Tobi defo not in their group
From jjs freestyle u can tell he has a ghost writer for his music 🤣
Ftbi he aint tolkig
josh didn't see fuck all mate 13:45
But hw tobi vent?
This lobby is so bad at this game it is actually hilarious to watch lmao
jj forehead jumpscare first second
Poor tobi got gassed for being an engineer
we need a complaition of tobi among us rages, I'm pretty sure there's more than enough for a 5-10 min video
14:21 sus noise
4:34
JEEEEZ SO LOUD
i feel like jj’s forehead wouldn’t seem that big if he’s wasn’t trynna hide it this whole time😂
Bro I genuinely can’t stand vik in among us
14:20 blunder by ellum
"id love to kill you but i cant" *kills anyway almost instantly* ksi logic everyone
Ellum and KSI sussing each other out: Josh: 🔪
Bros forehead 😳😮‍💨
BRUHHH SHUSH
I love JJ's sound of beeping between each round it always geeks me out hahaha
Tobi was acting like a child
Bro anyone else seen jj's big ass fore head in the beginning
Toby crying the whole video lmao
Randy looking like a chipmunk
poor toni man. he’s always so kind to everyone too
Tobi's pain when he tried to speak
Check honeyylovee301 on twitch
Why is ksi  soooo dumb .. loooooll big fan of your intelligence jj bruda.
i do have fun with my freinds.......-tobi
i can relate to Tobi
I fr thought for a sec that jj was bald. What I'm saying is DAT FOREHEAD BIG AS HECK
I can’t vent, that was hilarious
Ayo jjs head has no business being that big
Im not the impostor, i rather eat your pasta
lol the he just wanted to call me miniminter moments
12:44 Is Ethan laughing or coughing?
Tobi should’ve pulled a Vik: “SHUT THE F*CK UP”
14:20
How did they skip that first KSI kill, it literally could only have been JJ and no one else
the many men editing is on point
i love how subtitles say that they have 'sauce' on other ppl instead of sus 😂
The vacuous drake cumulatively guide because catsup admittedly disagree sans a puny decrease. majestic, damaged tongue
JJ’s forehead caught me off guard bro-
"only £50"
I'm not even gonna lie the title might as well say sidemen among us
Loved the feature in this video... JJ's forehead
When I saw the title I thought 'oh just a normal among us video' lol
Ksi going bald did you see that forehead
This is the best among us yet
I thought jj was bold at the start for a second
God KSI's forehead is long as History
Man poor Tobi...
0:08 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nah Toby annoyed me this game. How hard is it to say "I'M THE ENGINEER". Instead he was trying to tell them a full on novel sized back story
The brief agreement finally burn because mascara archaeologically scratch up a serious head. panicky, miscreant cowbell
JJ’s forehead is massive lmao
No one cares about tobi 😂
11:56 look at viks pic in the wallet
Toby’s mic and voice are way to quiet
Jesus Jj’s forehead
If you get proximity chat then I would watch these videos
FOREHEAD
dont know why people people feeling sad for tobi, he is just bad at the game, instead of shouting "listen me" he just had to shout "i am engineer". this game is about how well can you lie and manipulate, and tobi is just bad at it.
Are we all just gonna ignore what Harry said at 6:27???😭😂😂😂😂😂
Pls do more among us
Tobi is the Kevin of the group
Why does simon not like being called miniminter
JJ's forehead is very distracting?
4:36 PASTA JJ VOTE JAJAJAJAJAJAJA
Josh was like "I'm better without you", let Behz get voted out and then went on a rampage 😂😂
4 hed
I'd really like to see another Among Us in Real Life!
#stopTobiNeglect
JJ's for head thogh
1 Corinthians 10:31 we as 31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.🙏🏽
Can we go get all there separate channels to 10 mil? I feel like they would be happy and finally relax
6:44
Toby like de bruyne, let me talk!!
Man just wants to say one thing and the lobby starts shouting.
oh my fucking god Tobi's frustration, HOW DID NOBODY HEAR HIM-
GAH DAMN forehead jumpscare girl i forgot what ksi looked like w/o the bandana
Tobi learn to talk
Josh got mad at JJ for not voting and proceeds to do the same thing 1 video later💀💀
poor tobi
I read all the comments talking about how tobi got over spoken and I was expecting a madness, it wasn’t that deep. He got way too emotional at the end especially to Ellum, you can do that to your own friends but not to a guest that’s not on. Whatever shit happens though is what it is
More plz
bruh why is KSI so freaking slow, Logan prob broke his head
We love elum
Tobi’s shouting is normal people’s voice lmao that’s why no one’s hearing him
I got angry seeing tobi angry... #LetTobiSpeak
At 0:00 bro I'm dead asf😂
3:25 had me so dead 💀
Toby always plays the victim….
wow
Tobi is just bad vibes he gets so mad it’s just a game
If i was tobi i would have left
3:46
Poor tobi :(
6:23 sus
1:11, 9:37, 14:21 😂😂😂 This is why I watch these videos!  Among Us is the best game they play!
Good on ya ksi I see what u did
Imagine if Tobi just wasn’t unmuted and that’s why they weren’t hearing him
BROOOOOOO, KSI's fuckin' forehead
I swear the sidemen are the dumbest crew on among us ever: Simon has hard proof that JJ is the imposter Josh says: “I don’t want you on my team” Everyone: Forgets about JJ being the imposter
Tobi was moving like KDB with Silva juss wishing they’d "LET HIM TALKKK' looool😂😂😂😂
Ksi Hairline😂
Oh nahh how fucked up is jjs hairline thats fucked
14:21
#LetTobiSpeak
JJs forehead is HUGE
tobi had to have been muted right? 😭😭
Where can I get the tune at the end of the video ?
damn no wonder he wears a headband
It’s only game? Why you have to be mad? 🤔 had me rollin 😭
Harry: we could double kill , if we both get randy 😂
put the bandana on jj
NDL
6:21 💀💀🤣🤣
Randy's got jokes 😂
why dose the titelnot say randy goeas 100000000 iq
his hairline
14:19 nhhhhhhhhh yyyessssssss.   Someone needs to pair that clip to when Randy went awhhhhhh yeaaaahhh in silent library 1
0:39 - Famous Last Words.
Poor Tobi nobody everyone let's him talk. JJ and Miniminter fight like a married couple every time
LET MY MAN TOE B SPEAK
Ksi is sped af
10:01 Randy is elite for this one hahahaha
Bro I thought his forehead was edited 💀💀💀
I thought jj would freestyle:  "Yo I'm not the killer, I didn't pull the trigger, don't vote out a n-word"
14:27 wtf 😂
BRYSGOLOV
I just realized that JJ didn't have his bandana on I'm getting used to seeing him like this. awesome
4:20 randy with the rap tho
4:34, the best part
I feel like Toby will be the first one to leave the sidemens
11:08 Pain
Harry: “of course I chased you, you got that sweet f*cking  a$$hole bro.”  6:27 Lmao
Poor Tobi man
Josh not voting is also a big throw.
what happened to these video for the last few days? I always see some flashes on the screen
ksi is the best 3rd imposter
do more among us vids its entertaining <3
God I so want to play a game if among us with them  I literally had a dream about it. We played among us and then we all went to the mall 😭😂
That’s a big for head jj
16:30 how stupid can u be jj😂😂😂😂😂
if u use a pet, it will stay whereever u were killed for the rest of the game
All that knowledge in that forehead
I swear jj's forehead gets bigger every day
poor Tobi, no-one listened to him 😔
how does a human forehead be so big smh
JJ is such a bot in this game & i love it 😂😂😂
Ayo nah jj gotta just go close shave at this point
Tobi cant even defend himself, its too loud. 🤣🤣😂
Quien viene de parte de yeyo?
10:22 “ I saw Harry and Miniminter” it sounds funny when he says that🤣
tobis L
tobi should’ve just got to the point and said he was engineer straight away instead of waffling
i feel like tobi mic in game should be at 100% cause of that LOl
WHY IS TOBI SUCH A WET WIPE
anybody else seen vik's proposal when he swipes card?
#LetTobiSpeak 😭🎤
14:20
Bro, can Simon shut up for one minute and let Tobi speak? Everyone just kept making jokes meanwhile he's tryna say one sentence.
NDL
HAHAHAHHAHAHA "Real quick, real quick, real quick"
whoever called oxygen at the end out of Josh and Ethan, that was a game winning move
Poor Toby
Can the sidemen play dead by daylight it’s to funny when they play
https://youtube.com/shorts/IoLk80H3Q5Q?feature=share
can this mfs turn tobis volume up in discord? i would literally quit out of frustration
Best tactic is when u are engineer, start of the game run to medbay and hop in the vent, en look at electrical so you can see the first kill in electrical
Man don’t involve Randy. He ruins the fun. Talks over Everyone. We don’t come here to see a non sidemen.
JJ s head
U guys should do these videos more, its really fun to watch👍
Ellum is lame
Sidemen among us is just whole other thing! It’s just great!
10:26 😂😂😂
More of among us would be great
sidemen=most scuffed amog us
forehead season
Harry: "I'm following you cause you e got a sweet Fing a-hole". Brilliant!
JJs forehead is wam 😂🤣🤣
Ellum kinda sus tho
The iq in these lobbies is actually crazy
Honestly speaking Josh is the best imposter in sidemen among us
Tobi is the whitest black man I've ever seen
Tobi moving like Kevin De Bruyne when they didn’t let him talk
Can we get a sidemen among us proximity and ghosts talk to imposters video? Was funny watching Vik stress tf out on his stream from the ghosts😂Don’t know how hard that is to set up
Tobi is so cringe lately.
JJ gotta put a jump scare warning on that forehead
They should turn on the extra roles when they play
wow. jjs forehead is indeed massive.
Ive been rewatching every Among Us videos,thank fuck their uploading again
Every body can speak until tobi becomes obito😈
JJ actually believe his nonsense, which is amazing
Who else hates randy
I really hope Tobi doesn't leave the sidemen. They wouldn't be the same without him. Love you Tobi.
Sheesh jj always talking that bs his hairline wishing it was on cal when he had cancer
Kill all sidemen except tobi
Poor Tobi! My guy
I can't vent
JJ’s hair and four head must be old friends because they go way back no cap tho
DON'T read my name!
they should play Elden Ring I'll laugh my ass off
ksi hairline tho 😂
They should do another shapeshifter video
You guys should do an among us video but with 3 imposters
Wtf is jj’s hairline!?
Genuinely had a heart attack when jjs face popped up w that forehead
tobi just drags the side men , he acts like an annoying little bro and gets angry when he isnt heard
Wow
Great edit when Ethan is swiping on admin with the picture of him and his girl. W editor
Is the next Sidemen vs Youtube All Stars charity match taking place on Babatunde’s forehead HO-LY !!
what does third imposter mean? (i don’t play amongus or watch sidemen)
4:35 im eating pasta rn lol
Only £50 to bribe on among us and they saying it’s not worth it, these guys are rich rich
poor Tobi
I love Tobi
Hilarious episode
JJ hairline is clapped
Everytime i see harry being imposter i think “OH IM A SABOTAGER” Lmaoo
Jj's forehead hahahhahahaha
Lol 😂
Oh is it rlly not pronounced miniminter
Why do I always want the impostors to ein
They gotta try town of us
Nice :))
Mario kart?
Anyone else here never played this game but knows this map like the back of their hand purley from sidemen vids 😂?
JJ is literally trolling. "I think it's Ellum" bro you were with him the whole time wtf.
w me too i just want uuu i and i won’t tell
Ik how Tobi feel
Tobi that so funny
Tobi is such a baby.
Tobi Tobi don’t take it personal man had me dying
Harry and JJ a new ship
The intro of just yawning 🥱 lol
Randolph is kinda godly
Jjs hairline is crazy
poor KSI forehead :(
Miniminter and ksi connection is elite 😂
Is that actually jj for head   No hate, just curious
Get the Aussies back!!!
Ngl I got shocked by jjs hairline
I reckon they should try it with 3 killers
anyone notice Josh’s face is goin yellow and green?? anyone know if hes okay?
Jj's mouth is as big as his forehead. Too noisy
Yeaaaaaaaaassss there backk
BRO HIS HAIRLINE IS TAKING UP ALL MY ATTENTION JJ WHAT HAPPENED
all i am thinking of is jjs forehead
Tobys such a bean
Poor tobi he’s literally my fav sidemen
Does Ellum say bro in every single sentence?
jj pls put the bandana back on
I don’t like Ellum ffs get him out
Jj doesn’t his own music 😂😂
I wanna give Tobi a hug after this round 🥲
is that vain on the side of JJ’s head a imposter aswell?
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
tobi needs to stay quiet. hes filler not content. good they kept him quiet
Poor Tobi getting talked over all the time
JJ: "It's the oppose of NAV"  Randy: "...Van"  Randolph out here playing chess... such a sussy chungus
Ksi, I set the posters and they found it, they found ur ha**lin*
Imagine if the impostor was in the dead peaple chat, that would be so jokes. The impostor could legit talk to the person he kills haha
The whole video I was steering at JJ’s forehead 😂😂😂
3:23 is the funniest part of the vid for me
tobi is so boring. i been watching sidemen since 2014 n he literally brings nothing to sidemen, tbh if it was cal or cal the channel wouldve been more better and better content as well
The pain of being JJ's forehead
ksis forehead oml
Surely Tobi was muted???
Dude I haven't watch sideman in a hot secand the first thing I saw was jjs forehead quick sec thought he was bald💀
you guys should play among us with phill
I mean tobi did vent being engineer in front of elum, why wouldn’t he suspect him?
Poor Tobe
Its only game why i have to be so mad….that killed me at the end man 😭
Bro honestly the first clip I thought JJ actually went bald for a sec
Man like Randy
Cry Boby
KSI’s forehead is heavily distracting
Tobi gotta turn up he’s mic
Bring back the Bogzilla intro
Look at jj he look like a cute alien
Jj speaking over tobi 24/7 pain 😞
Why do they say BRO SO MUCH WTF
Am I the only one who saw behz and his girlfriend picture in the wallet during the admin swipe. Time: 0:29
They need to keep making these among us videos so enjoyable 👍🏻💙
I like ducks
4 month ago: last episode of amongus  4 months later:
I love among us keep uploading
Next Among Us vid, Tobi gonna have his mic volume on 120%
We can all agree that this is the worst sidemen among us ever.
We are on a planet of 7B people and 5B subscription.
i was shocked when i saw JJ without his bandana i've seen his forehead before but DAMN i think the headset makes it different somehow
Toby has a bad attitude victim syndrome
God I hate randy and his teeth
People still play among us?!
Let toby speak, the videos are such a pain to follow when he can’t even speak ffs man
Im going to feel like Tobi if you don't like
JJ being brave for this vid damn
Keep these coming 🔥🔥🔥
Jj 😂💀
my guys hairline
I thought amoung us is ded
"Big Sussy chungus juice"
Bro, in the end no one checked the left side…
Tobi finally admitting he’s boring is the one. Been saying it for years
I'm getting frustrated because all I can focus on is jj's forehead
So we just gonna ignore jjs forhead?😂
Ksi cover your forhead man it scaring me
"You hade sussy juice all over you i was trying to lictk that up" That is someones dad you know
Plot twist: Tobis mic was muted
I've never felt bad for a man as much as I felt bad for this guy Tobi
bro KSIs forehead is Fucking huge what the heck
Anyone saw when vik did the indian head shake 11:05?🤣
honestly, the sidemen are very relatable in among us sometimes, cuz I definitely have reported a body by accident, killed the wrong person on impulse and fucked up my story on the spot lmao, also, not wanting to be impostor cuz that's stressful af
nice
Tobi copying kdb : Let me talk, Let me talk
I'm honestly mad the editors didn't insert De Bruyne "Let me talk" in for Tobi's rage
We need another one this week
Forhead bigger than my future
how ya all so bad in such a simple game?
I hope they can now see how much of a direct impact their treatment of Tobi causes. Listen to the man.
11:53  yoo i love this easter egg
why does tobi resort to crying? just repeat your self again, with a lobby of like 10 man what do you expect? just have fun jesus, deads the energy
I love how no one plays this but they still make content for it bc the game is fun with friends, W gang
why there's no justice for tobi...
10:00 🤣🤣”uhmm Van”
Bro Tobi just cried the entire video
the forehead in the first 5 seconds
randy teeth and yellow
JJ you have the Biggest forehead on earth
Can’t see the game cause of jjs glare
tobi a cry baby
"VAN"
I feel tobi's pain. it's not about game anymore if most of the person in the  lobby were avoiding your words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q9-4-Mi114&t=3s
Ksi massive forehead
I feel bad for tobi Ignored so bad
did anyone else see the pic of faith and ethan when he did the task at 0:29
I love sidemen amongs
no one talking about jj's forhead
This is so entertaining 😂
F for tobi
I could never be a woman, being born as a man i remeber 20 years ago girls used to say that they wish they were men and there is a reason for that, naturally were stronger, handsome, providing, protecting etc etc, one of the best things about being a man is that it takes little effort and we grow to be warriors, thats who you are as a male, original man is a male aka a warrior, these days you got men wearing dresses but yet they woukd look and be so much better being who they naturally are, i am man he who built this world, without he there would be no you, if all police were women there wouldnt be police, there wouldnt be construction, there wouldnt be sperm to reproduce, we are the apex, we are the warriors of this planet so what in this virtual hell are people doing following along with the crazy ideas we see on tv and facebook, zzzzzzzzzzzzz your all smoking or dreaming
Who’s ellum and why does he say bro every sentence
Play the airship map, it's very good and big
I dont think KSIs forehead is that bad, its his hairstyle exposing it all, although that's the KSI look so he cant change it
JJ's forehead is the only object that is in the Northern and Southern hemisphere simultaneously.
The opposite to nav..VAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣
do more among us...
Yo JJ's hair lining though
JJ's forehead killed me from the start😂
JJ's forehead killed me from the start😂
Randy gotta brush his teeth
Are we really going to ignore JJ's massive forehead?
Poor black guy
Anyone else notice ksi’s forehead
Also is KSI wearing a Simpsons shirt: yes. HE IS IN THE SIMPSONS GANG
The 666th video

Felt sad for tobi 😢
11:06-11:38 Tobi has been watching too much Kevin De Bruyne
Editors elite 😂😂😂😂
JJ went supersonic without a helmet.
Why is this the first time I am seeing KSI's forehead
Is Tobi leaving the Sidemen?
LET ME SPEAK
I actually can't remember the last time Tobi was imposter🤔
Let TOBY SPEAK JESUS
Vik always trys to be the smartest one and ends up 3rd imposter lol
I felt so bad for Tobi
look at the wallet when vikk swipes the card
15:28
Alternate title: 0 IQ Sidemen Among Us Ep. 69 idk

When Tobi couldn’t get a word in I felt his pain
Just keep bringing the Among Us content
Ksi: The opposite of nav Randy: Van
KSI: Your girlfriend’s forehead is mad Also KSI:

Nigga look like krillen
Tobi and De Bruyne are on the same level “LETTT ME TALLLKKKK!!!!”
Ksi: it’s the opposite of nav   Randy: van. Your kid is so lucky to have you😂😂😂😂😂😂
"opposite f nav" - ksi "van" - randy
I think JJ needs to phone francis nnganou for that hair transplant.... only if he wants it
Man KSI's forhead is huge
*van*
They need to play this vr version https://youtu.be/uAxVIt5ksHU
IVE MISSSEDDDD THIS SO MUCH OMG 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
@tobjizzle your not supposed to say ur an engineer :)
I'm loving the no bandana energy.
Lol the funny thing is when I see JJ calling out the wrong person in Among Us I always and laugh at him but honestly I’m like him when I play Among Us... if I see smt sus I automatically think that person is the imposter and never think twice abt it
Tobi is Kevin De Bruyne “Let me talk!”
16:25 lol this is so funny ellum thinking jj is his teamate when he is the unnoficial third imposter.
JJ transforming into prime Wilfried Zaha with this haircut
tobi no one is gonna stay quiet for you to speak so stop saying listen or stop just say what you wanna say louder and more.
JJ caught me off guard without the bandana
Let TOOOOOBYYYYYY speaaaak
Just when I needed a video to watch while I eat!!!! Thank you
Sidemen Among Us never gets old
poor tobi
11:57 lmao took me a second and saw the photo on the wallet 😂 cute
Poor Tobi just keeps getting violated 😂😂
My god jj’s forehead
So glad you guys brought among us game back

This is the funniest
Why des JJ Look so much better without a bandate
"only £50"?
Make more among us these shits are hilarious
poor tobi 😂😂
simon getting mad at jj calling him miniminter is hilarious.
I feel bad for Tobi, he is always crewmate
I understand Tobi's frustration cause nobody was listening to him aha
Plz stop doing videos with Randolph man. He’s so cringe
poor Tobi man
this video just shows how nice guys finish last
No one cares Tobi
oh my god I can't get enough of them playing. the last scene where jj thought it was ellum was so dramatic I couldn't stop laughing 🤣.
https://youtu.be/mPzJ9JGRq8k
https://youtube.com/shorts/rdkhlR8eu0E?feature=share
I love tobi his my favourite 😤
Towards the end ksi really should have let tobi speak bro that was lowkey rude 💀
Where is the bandana get the bandana 💀
Forehead 💀
I was in a lobby with Harry same name same costume and the lobby was a wreck it was getting weird and and I purely thinkharry was in there just became it was funny and I left a message saying" Harold sidemen" and then left cuz they didn't start the game and now I watched this video and it he had the same name and costume and forgot to get his Id 🤦 I'm just disappointed at myself tbh😂
Nah but jjs forehead is actually madd
Randy legit the 8th sidemen by now
ayyyyyy
I hope this video does well so they do it again, also tobi got violated
0:08 when I see 👀 🤣🤣🤣 👶
nahh the sidemen were bare rude to not let tobi speak
love the among us vids
Why are so many people hating on Tobi? I’d be annoyed too if I was trying to speak and people just kept talking over me
simon when JJ calls him ‘miniminter’ instead of ‘daddy’ : 🤬
Randy was a fed first round
Tobi is just so irrelevant man literally the least interesting person.
ksi hairline ?

3:05 😭 best line Tobi
I feel Tobi pain
Damn ksi has phat  forehead
Bruuuv JJ's forehead is bigger than my future
Tobi trying to speak that is absolute jokes 🤣🤣🤣
The Sidemen could upload this forever and I’d still enjoy it
I literally binge-watched all the Among Us videos by the Sidemen for like the 5 fifth time, and I got blessed with another one!
Tobi is a baby lmao
"Amongus's" lol
Instead of Ellum bring Stephen Tries he's hilarious and can sabotage anyone with his confronting skills.

"I haven't got anything other than crewmate for the last 5 amonguses" TBJZL- 2022

LOL
That forehead tho...
JJs foreheads grown a mile!
Why is tobi getting hate for this??? Wtf man he deleted his insta account cuz of all the hate. He is legit one of the nicest youtubers ik
The forehead is alive and real
Toby was actually just being a bitch when he was trying to speak. He needs to learn to just spit it out over everyone else. He is waiting for a chance that will never happen
If anyone saw Ethan’s pic with his wife in the wallet at 0:29👍🏻😭😂
Tobi is so good at football
STOP CALLING ME MINIMINTER
‘So the bodies in weapons’ Me: oh… oh hi vik..??
JJ is so rich, he couldn't buy a windows activation key
If u don’t focus on jj fully he looks bald af
Toni LET ME F*CKING SPEAK

Bro why is that the first thing I see💀
⭐

Randy was on a madness being poirot man
JJs hairline further back than the evolution of man from Neanderthal
Harry is very bad at this game😂 he's very obvious and suspicious when his an impostor😂🤣
Fuck YES!!!! You are the man KSIIIII!! Courageous and Bold!!
People are still playing this game?
Disike for the hairline
JJ without a Durag?
Poor tbjzl
we've all been where tobi is in this vid :'(
WHAT IS THE OUTRO MUSIC
Tobi should just raise his mic volume
Simon is a sussy crewmate
Actually felt sly for Tobi tbh
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.   (Mark 12:30)
I'm happy jj has embraced his forehead
yo jj i love the hair
JJs forehead looks bigger 💀
I really like jj without the bandana you know, just looks more Megamind
Justice for tobi
Imagine if jj paid everyone in the match and they all just act like they saw nothing when jj kills infront of them
Pls keep making among us videos
Nice
"Body on the floor"  "Well it's not gonna be on the sky, is it?"
Ksi looks cute without the bandana not even joking man
Tobi just needs to turn hes mic volume up and start screaming when they talk over him
I see JJ's just embracing his forehead now

Felt so bad for tobi at the end there lmao
Bro JJ’s forehead is genuinely impressive
I love how we've grown up and aren't talking about JJ s massive forehead
13:48 How has Josh got away with that, I’ve never heard somebody so sus in my life.😂😂😂
Next video don't let us know who the imposter is and let's us try to figure it out with you guys
11:23 You see how Vik goes very near in the mic so that he’s loud enough to be heard? Do that.
More sidemen among us 👏🙌
7:44 £50 isn’t enough to throw an amongs us game?  We all truly are poor in comparison to these lads.
You guys gotta let Toby talk
Vikks laugh 😂😂
Tobi channeled his inner De Bruyne in this video.
I’m disappointed I didn’t get to see the KDB let me talk meme
We just use to ksi’s forehead now
Tobi, just a heads up Your mic mutes your screams. You sound so quiet 😂
LetTobiSpeak!!!
Lol anyone else sees Harry’s shirt

Why is the top left of JJ's screen always blurred on this game?
We love Randolph
You know JJ is a crew mate when he starts running for the emergency button 😂😂
Every talkin over tobi is so fucking funny

They need to try modded among us.  I beg
Love this
https://youtu.be/lw5Z6P8-ZzI_  https://youtu.be/YNZoioqi2Ks_
Tobi 🤝De Bruyne " Let Me Speak !!!".
11:30 Tobi is me when I’m in a discord call, or any type of conversation. no one listens to me because my voice is quiet, even when I shout
https://youtu.be/lw5Z6P8-ZzI_  https://youtu.be/YNZoioqi2Ks_
Ellum gives me CDawgVA vibes
jeez louise the hairline's mad
💪
jj always reports in the worst times 😂
The sidemen should do a new video on rocket league for knockout event im pretty sure ksi will enjoy that mode
The forehead is immaculate
love that the sidemen are still posting among us vids, literally like the only people but in the best way!
Why is ksi looking like megamind
Tobi crying every round, he needs to grow up lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcR7cVAARZQ&list=PL2BHxjwijuzeQaKTjxkOmnZa_BH5eBcbm&index=2
LETS GO
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Randy's 200IQ Play in that first game tho...
Jesus jj hair line you could play pocker
People love this game and I one of them
JJ is just out here teasing Simon even though he’s “dead” - or why the KSIMON meme will never die
You know the vid's gonna be good when it starts with JJ yawning
I need subtitles for Randy.
The tobi situation made this video hard to watch. I love your videos but Let the man speak!!!
Josh needs to relax blokes nearly 30 and taken among us like it’s life or death
tobis road rage is showing through when he plays this game
like this for an among us video but only Tobi can speak...would be hilarious
Randys elite
Duuude the wallet edits at 'Admin: Swipe Card' task
Its so funny when tobi is talking LET ME FUCKING SPEAK and then ksi is like vote me out😂😂😂😂
I'm ap glad u guys are doing this again, its so funny
There is nothing more infuriating than constantly being spoken over. That shit makes you rethink your life.
Look how perfect the sidemens teeth are. It's like they have money
I actually was triggered for Tobi when they wouldnt let him speak lol
Why does simon hate being called miniminter?
KSI - miniminter Simon - don't call me miniminter KSI - ok minimaainter😂
tobi cringe af
as much as i love ksi, i must admit he has some iq problems
JJ's forehead 💀
13:25 14:21
JJ's hairline is mad
JJ is by far the worst imposter I have ever seen 🤣
Bro, JJs hairline is actually a madness
Tobi is probably that one guy in discord who everyone has set their volume to like 30%.
Randolph 🐐
Love the content y’all✊🏽 can y’all head back to pro clubs? Loved that from old sidemen 🔥🔥
justice for Tobi
A smart thing to do would fake being scientist then call meeting whenever someone died because u are imp and know when they die
JOSH IS THE GOAT
Nah bit unfair lads, let tobi speak.
Sidemen among us is bussin
Honestly the Sidemen should never stop playing this game it is so much fun to watch.
the new more sidemen logo looks like hubs gay one
Ive been rewatching among us videos on repeat thank god they released a new vdeo
AHHHH THE GLEAM OFF THE DOME IS BLINDING
JJs hairline is actually making me feel uncomfortable
We need more
Yo the sidemen playing mortal kombat In the knockout tournament style would be lit 🔥🔥
Only among us vids that r acc good
where the forehead comments at tho
Honestly in the past few weeks. In my personal opinion, this game shows more fun and excitement for me than anything else
If I would be an imposter I would kill "MINIMINTER" first.
අපි අතරේ බෝල සැක සහිත ගව බර්ගර් අපි අතරේ සැකයි
I've never felt bad for a man as much as I felt bad for this guy Tobi
16:54 glad finally someone said it lmao. Love Toby but he’s unbearable playing Among Us. Acts like it’s a constant 7v1 and everyone is out to get him.   Like everyone doesn’t get shit on playing this game lol
14:21 had me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love how JJ now has faced his fear of showing his forehead. After Jidion made fun of him i think he made the decision not to wear any head cover. He’s doing it now so it’s the normal for him and his appearance. Smart move and i Fully support this. 💯💯👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Please never stop playing among us.
Hmmmmmm
The forehead
so we aint talking bout jjs forhead?
Let Tobi speak🤜🏽🤛🏽
After 2 years JJ has still not learned to not self report
Plz don’t stop playing this.
Babatunde among us when?
More among us😭😍
sad tobi
Sussy chuggus juice
Great video but looking at JJ’s hairline hurt my eyes every time!
man you gotta feel for tobi xD
I love the sidemen among us videos, but genuinely speaking this one was mid compared to others.   I feel like the imposters could’ve played much better, and everyone was jst shouting.  I feel Tobi’s pain
Randy was so annoying in this video
Poor Tobi man... Felt that.
The editing was great yet again
Always a great video i hope they continue gta videos too🔥
Nice wallet Ethan
Josh and Ethan going "Just run it" killed meeeee
God bless spread the gospel
Jj’s forehead is massive man
JJ: I'm in the oppposite of Nav Randy: VAN 😂
Tobi increase your mic sensitivity, talk over them ffs, among us fr makes you lose friends haha
hey guys will you do an among us with corpse?  it will be fun.
“I’d love to kill you but I can’t” Proceeds to kill him literally 5 seconds later!!! JJ what are you doing man
Poor toby haha
We want more videos of sidemen playing among us. Love from India ❤️
God damn why tf ksi forhead on my screen my guy
Uuuuuuuughghgufhgh
ॐ
Tobi is me af in most among us games  LET YA BOI SPEAK
Poor tobi
i love this
hahahhahah
bro tobi is such a sook playing games
These are my favourite MoreSidemen videos... perfection
Randy is too smart to play with the sidemen.
Toby was sounding like KDB😂
Asking for Sidemen Mario Kart -Day 55
12:57
Tobi reminds of when I didn't speak for a straight 15 minutes when hanging out with my mates.
Let the man speak! I feel for you tobi!
Tobi really is such an underrated sidemen, they never let him have his moment let alone speak. I get it’s funny at times when they randomly just vote him out but you can tell he’s starting to make it a bit personal now
If I’m honest, I don’t like looking at JJ with his bandana off. His forehead is so veiny and fucking huge 😂😂
Tobi just needs to keep screaming down the mic is my hard
Jj has enough money to implant a new hairline
MORE OF THIS PLSSSSSSSSSS
is this tobi de bruyne?
14:21 only if zerka voted for ellum 🤦😂
I really like the outro music
JJ’s forehead
I see why jj wheres a bandana
What headset is josh using
*Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content for us* 👍👍👍🥳🥳
these will never ever get old
Among us every week!
Can you please turn down JJ’s audio volume 😭
i would be so stressed if i was tobi he's always ignored
JJs forehead is so big
i watch these old videos on repeat daily please never ever stop
This game with the sidemen is chaos and I’m here for it!
Tobis too salty lol, id be annoyed when everyone's egos are shouting down the mics too. I thought he quit this game ages ago, like last year
Toby getting mad is like a kitten angry about something it’s so jokes 😂😂😂
That Intro was Inspirationall!!!
tobi : LET ME TALKKKKKKKK LET ME TALKKKKKKKKKKK
Tobi=KDB
Simon getting mad at JJ for calling him miniminter has the same energy as when your gf gets mad you call her by her name 💀
Tobi needs a bass boosted mic honestly so he can show who’s boss
Tobi, I know u probably won't see this but I hope u feel better. Feel better soon 🙏
🔥
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY THANK YOU SIDEMEN
Poor Tobi 😢
These videos need to be longer, the Sidemen playing Among Us is peak content
Would love to see gib in among us with u guys 👀
Then tobi realizes he was muted
How does JJ constantly play with the "Activate Windows" message on his screen lol
We love the among us content it’s too funny
We want more of the shapeshifter mod pleasee
Is KSI's hairline edited or is my phone screen gliching?
Bro hate to be this guy, but Tobi has a right to be pissed.  That said, it’s probably to do with supremely dodgy connecting issues on Discord.  I don’t think it’s anyone’s fault.
Keep the Among Us Games coming please 😭😂😂
Tobi such a sook XD
Tobi literally: Let me talk!!!! let me talk!!!
tobis soft ass needs to speak up lmao
Randy in the first game was so fucking funny, he is genuinely the funniest person even when he doesn't try to be
🤣
josh could have just voted ellum and won
Get deji in
GTA is way better, let’s keep it 55th street. on hood
when vikk trying to be the detective and save the imposters
Randy tryhards so much lmao
oh my god i feel for tobi HAHAHHAHAHA
Tobi mic 🎤trash 🤣🤣
Whenever I play this mind fuck of a game I’ll always try find a lobby with 2 shifters bc the only way I’d be imp is if I can not be myself, immediately refuse
Someone tell them that all engineers need to do is stay in vents and watch people die...
14:47 Josh's intense anime moment😂😂
Mmmhhh yesss
they really do all just speak over tobi and never listen to what he has to say. its so annoying
The imposters win by default, the amount of confusion when they play is literally the easiest way to win
2:05 LMAO 3:05 Tobi being wholesome 4:10 My goat Randy 6:27 7:32 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 9:39 LMAOOO 13:30 xd 14:21 RAHHHH 16:05 im creasing. absolute donut

It’s almost as if without the bandana, JJ becomes dumber
They still milking this lol
Goated series💯
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life ✝️🙏
I feel so bad for Tobi lmao
They mistreated this man Tobi so hard
Tobi a wittle baby
Why KSI is Dumb: - He Saw Vik Not Simon - Simon Died in Electrical  - Harry is Not Impostor - That's Not How Glitch Works
Let tobi speak 😂
Tobi is cringe
someone mod the servers so tobi is real fucking loud and they have to listen 😂
The editing is elite.
So sad to see Tobi being ignored 😂😂
I really hope this series continues!!!   Maybe play a different map next time too
MINIMINTER
Tobi turned into Kdb
Bros forehead goes all the way up Jesus Christ
I love how in the other video everyone told Tobi that he just needs to shout to be heard. Now he's sitting there yelling for an entire round and everyone completely ignores him. Man's was struggling that entire meeting
poor toby man
Shut up Tobi
i feel you tobi, i feel you
2 min of silence for tobi
You guys can’t split up
Why is Toni angry
JJ be like: "damn MINIMINTER died, I miss MINIMINTER so much"
love seeing this again
Let tobi talk, LET HIM TALK
10:02 My guy said VAN lmaooooooo
we need some proximity mod
Justice for Tobi 😔
now I can imagine Tobi's road rage
More
pls let tobi speak man
Why did this pop up when I searched for asmr mouth sounds?
More among us.
Sidemen are single handedly reviving among us and I'm loving every second of it
Bryzgalov meme 10/10
Mooooore Among us plz
BRO tobi was pissed.. lol
Tobi be like kdb LET ME TALK😂
GIVE US MORE! MORE! MORE!
honestly sidemen are the only reason i watch among us videos in general they make them so good
Every more sidemen viewer just got a free subscription to forehead plus
#justiceforTobi
Tobi was kinda annoying
BUT. THERES NO THIRD IMPOSTER
Tobi can never get a sentence out 😭😭
I love when you included Ilya Bryzgalov 🤣  “It’s only game, why you have to be mad?”
0:29 damn did the editor editted Ethan's family photo onto the wallet right? that was subtle but very nice
Pls continue among us
JJ: you know it's not NAV but the opposite of nav  Randolp: VAN
JJ is so dumb I love it 😂
Im going to say it…. I enjoy these more than sideman Sunday.
Tbh sidemen should post this more it's just so entertaining and fun to watch, one of the most exciting series
dude i feel Tobi's frustration
Please put a jumpscare warning when it switches to JJ and his fivehead thanks
Play goose goose duck
Never stop doing Among Us.
Randy 2000iq moment
I absolutely  hate it when jj knows the killer and he blames some one else. He never backs his teammates bro. I know its funny but sometimes it's annoying
Vikk is so bad at investigating
Man couldn't even speak to save his life 🥹 Poor Tobi
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Thx for reading
I feel Tobi's pain. It's Soo jarring when that happens
i beg for more
Top tier
tori was so heated lmao
anyone notice the edit of vik proposing when he was doing the card swipe task?
love these
Poor Tobi trying to talk 😂
"I feel Tobi's pain" button
stop getting randolph man this random seagull
Lol ... simon getting mad at jj for calling him miniminter was jokes
The genie ia back
bruh JJ needs his bandana back bro
Detective Randy is my new favorite troops alter ego
You guys should play some crab game
If the sidemen were to create another channel I pray to Beerus it’s a sidemen among us channel because I love these vids 🤣
It’s unfortunate that nobody seems to care to understand Tobi’s situation
The Ilya Bryzgalov clip from the NHL never gets old
Can it even be called a forehead if it goes to the top of his head?
Ellum is jokes in this
Justice for Tobi #LETHIMSPEAK
JJ yawning was the best part of the video 😂
That forehead gets worse everytime jj and we can tell because we get large gaps in between seeing it
Turns out, Toby’s mic was muted that second game
Noone likes Vik that muncher. Atleast 1 episode without Vik, he is so cringe that he actually psses me off!!!
I feel this game isnt good for Tobi's health.
“The opposite of nav” “VAN” Killed me
Tobi lowkey the worst at Among Us fr
Toby, chill
Look at that forehead 😂😂
I love Josh so much in these videos he’s so funny haha 😂
*VAN*
Jjs forehead kinda clean ngl
Bro the second round with ellum blaming tobi its just hilarious 😂
please do proximity chat
I’ve honestly been watching and rewatching all the sidemen among us videos this week, this is genuinely my favourite YouTube gaming series in years
LETSSSS GOOO
Tobi wasn't angry about losing the game really it was just because they lost due to not letting him speak
Randy carrying the sidemen, and basically my entire YouTube experience, as usual. Big up my guy Randy 😃
They should post the full videos again.
Tobi just gets violated
We don’t wanna hear tobi 😂😭😭😭 boring guy
Either tobi should man up and actually make them listen or just keep crying
Tobi just wanted to talk like KDB
GREAT VID AND TOBI ITS CAUSE YOURE NOT A KILLER
This made me so angry LET TOBI SPEAKKKKKKKKK
Its sooo aids when you try to explain yourself and someone is talking over you
more among us please
Tobi had the same energy as kdb screaming let me talk 😂😂
That hairline UwU
Harry paying Randolph was so funny ...Randolph was on smoke ...after pay day Randolph the imposter
Actually booring love the sidemen but this was the baddest one yet. There was no drama or anything , everything was random screaming and playin dum
I've never seen tobi so fumingggg
i'm surprised this game is still alive...
Fun fact : this is the MoreSidemen's 666th video, well done lads.
harry plays geniusly
Tony or whatever he’s called. Absolute baby
Bruh im the tobi too 💀😂🤦‍♂️
Best drink watch
Tobi is such a baby
big carry josh after almost throwing
I don't think tobi is in the rong they always talk over him .
The separate blizzard behaviourally snore because elizabeth neuropathologically muddle lest a tight ex-husband. abusive, juvenile population
Petition for daily among us
“It’s on the opposite of nav” “…van”
Lul
sidemen = among us = pure joy
Just two rounds, i can watch this for hours
JJ should stick with the Banda
❤️😂😂
Bring back Baldski
This is exactly the video I was wanting.
Nice forehead jj
We need more among us, not cuz of the game, it just got the best energy I guess
I just thought of something. I don’t play nor do I know any techniques so sorry if people already do this but if you’re shapeshifter, could you shift into someone and then go in front of someone and shift in front of them so they think the first person is the shapeshifter.  So basically like let’s say Simon is the shapeshifter, if he shifts into Harry where no one can see and then in front of Vik he shifts into Ethan, Vik will tell everyone that Harry shifted to Ethan so it’s Harry and he will get voted out. This could be a cool way to frame someone as the shapeshifter but idk, like I said I don’t play. The only people I watch play are these lot so idk.
Tobi with that KDB energy, "LET ME SPEAK"
i swear this is my fav kinda vido they make frfr
Bruh ksi so bad at this game🤣
0:30 idk if anyone else noticed the picture in the wallet
why is Tobi's microphone always quieter than everyone else's lmao
didn't like the vibe they were giving tobi in this video for some reason
#Listentotobi
lmao JJ "it's ellem 100%"  *Dies to Josh 2 seconds later*
Tobi seems mad stressed in this video, something bothering him IRL
Poor Tobi, everyone talking over him, that would make me feel so upset
The forehead is out once again! 😁🤤
TOBI LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
I like how JJ is embracing his forehead, fuck the haters bro. Stop fucking with him u losers
bro i feel bad for tobi lol
bro i feel bad for tobi lol
Harry trying to comfort Tobi at the end was the most wholesome thing ever
12:55
YES YES YES
You guys CANNOT  stop playing this game! It brings so many funny moments I think even better than gta vids
nah bro jj's forehead is a jumpscare fr
lol
Justice for Tobi
7:20 Harry playing a game for “cheeks”😅
lit ep.
Yeahhhh, please let Tobi speak lol
lmao i was just watching your among us vids from years ago, love rewatching them
We love you Tobi 🙏🏻💕
Poor Tobi
im so happy the editor brought back the "why you have to be mad?" meme
if i was tobi i would earrape them all to get attention
They should add a Jester onto these videos, so much opportunity for some funny clips especially with JJ
they did Tobi dirty 😂 let the man speak!!
Broooo the hairline 😂😂
justice for tobi :(
i feel tobi's pain, im surprised he hasn't popped a blood vessel shouting over these lot lmao
I’m sorry but HOW is you being engineer relevant? It really wasnt relevant when Somone else is about to get voted out. I understand u want to be heard, but don’t make it seem like u being heard wouldve changed the round.
Harry stinks as the impostor lol. Randy killed it this game. I felt bad for Toby though, he got so angry. People speaking over you can happen a lot in voice chat and it can get annoying so I can relate to him a bit there. I'd like to see him as the impostor sometime, maybe he can take his revenge ^^
13:00 imagine trying to say a good point and the guy with one brain cell replies with that and takes no notice 😂😭😂😭
Now Tobi finally knows how Kevin De bruyne feels
Ksi and Ellum being together for the whole round, they see a dead body while together. JJ: "I think it's Ellum"
PLAY MORE AMONG US!❤️
Ksi needa put his bandana back on💀
No hate I love u jj but we not gon talk bout your forehead 😭😭❤️
Josh's 2000 IQ gameplay
tobi trying to talk over everyone is so relatable
Three different types of people watching this video:   Watching the gameplay  Watching for the comedy   And watching for JJ’s forehead
JJ needs to see a doctor about those veins popping out of it head when he's just chillin, first time I've ever seen that
That’s cute how Simon cares when jj calls him miniminter not Simon #ksimon
13:27 meme ingredient 🤣🤣
Justice for tobi
15:51 killed me
more sidemen videos make me oh so happy
Miniminter had a poor performance expected better
When i clicked this video and i saw jj's forehead it looked bigger than before
TBJZL is the biggest criminal of tbe sidemen bunch
Best sidemen content is playing among us
watching the sidemen play among us is way more fun and better  than playing the game myself... mainly bcuz i don't hv friends 😅
I lost my chain that was gifted from my grandmother, and these guys always manage to cheer me up.
Everyone talking down to Tobi is infuriating
Lol these are always funny
just me saw viks proposal on swipe card at 11:54
What's the tune that plays at 17:18
I can really relate to Toby so watching that makes me mad af
POOR TOE B! 😭
10:23 6:15
This brings so much joy!
jj was selling so hard all video
Couldn’t be happier they’re making more among us content this shit is the funniest game 😂
randy ruin the first game
Poor Tobi
My boy tobi gettin done dirty man
JJ's forehead gets me everytime!
I LOVE THEM AMONG US ONESSSS
Don't worry Tobi. Atleast KDB feels you
tobi just needs to turn  up the gain to the max on his mic lol.
Anyone know what the track at the end of the video is? I'm bugged out because I'm not able to find it at all.
I feel like they enjoy cutting tobi off because he gets so pissed off😂
Let’s get a thread going where Ethan should change his name for among to Papa Payne.
W vid
these among us videos are BOOMING
Tommy T came out for a sec 4:27
Big man like randlock holmes
lowkey starting to hate jj in these vids lol becoming boring and cringe
Sidemen Beta squad among us would be the funniest video ever pls like to get this comment on top
Poor Tobi 😕❤️❤️❤️
Carry on with these videos they are so funny
Randy used his brain for once
Man I thought ksi was bald when he popped up 😭
Tobi with the Keving De Bruyne "LET ME SPEAK"
I felt so bad for Tobi
josh just never giving af is so funny
Poor Tobi can’t even talk
11:44 grade a under a vibes
Fifa video next 🙏🙏🏆
Jj: "I'd love to kill you but I cant"    *_literally 3 seconds later_*  Jj: *kills Ellum*
Bro when Ellum made that noise I literally had to pause my video from laughing so much 💀💀
I’ve been rewatching sidemen among us and didn’t realise this video was posted 5 hours ago. Happy surprise, keep posting among us content.
Yes!!!!!!!
Man I really wanted jj to call out ellum just to realize it’s not him
Randolph is annoying
It was my birthday yesterday could i get a happy birthday
The iq in this game hurts my brain
More among us
Please more of these Dailey among us is the best
When the veins in JJ head gets pumping
Randy is so funny man 😅 please involve him in more sidemen videos 🤞🏼🤞🏼
Poor Tobi…
Tobi needs to buy a Broken load 🍑 mic
There's no point in doing task because they hardly even go past the halfway mark lol
Jj forehead caught me off guard at the start of the vid 🤣🤣
u fuckers needa let tobi speak man smh
#LetTobiSpeak
Class gameplay from Miniminter
JJ
Ask Banksy to paint a mural on jjs forehead.
I get how frustrating it is to try and talk when people just keep talking over you
Seeing JJ's forehead for the first time in years was like seeing your inverted self for the first time, at first it was horrible but I'm getting used to it
Jj hairline doing a madness we will have baldski back naturaly you see
11:04 I feel bad for Tobi
repost?
Oh tobi
Only reason i click on these videos is to hear Randy say Sussy Chungus
jj threw both games
Could literally watch hour long versions of these
Best sidemen among us 😂
I get why tobi was triggered, he was trying to help everyone by saying he was engineer to win the game sooner but they really never let him speak. Honestly tobi should just be third imposter when they don't let him talk 😂
Ellum is so cute bruh
No wonder tobi can never talk, he always avoiding the point, like just say “I’m engineer” stop talking about dancing
the last round was so bad it’s so funny
Miniminter’s Among us hair looks like SSJ
I fucking love these among us videos😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why can’t this be longer
Nah Tobi actually gets treated like shit in these games. I know among us is chaos but he literally screamed yet they don’t care.
Who is ellum fr
I feel for toby man. When your that guy who wants to have a voice but no one listens. so peak man
JJs hairline is sus
Yyyyuyyy
JJ so dumb ngl
sidemen
2 among us videos in a week? Damnnn aren’t we lucky
Mad vid
Who's gonna tell them there's other maps too?
I though JJ got a new haircut, the way that forehead lookin…
@14:20 so frustrating that Josh didn't vote there, left Behz out to dry after JJ already said he was voting for Ellum.
“It’s only game. Why you have to be mad” 😂😂
With among us VR coming this year i feel like the game might become as big as it used to be again
So many legendary quotes and moments in this video alone 😂 love sidemen among us
Love him but JJ’s forehead is mad
When It comes to among us Tobi is de bruyne just let him talk😂😂
Someone tell Tobi to turn up the gain on his audio interface, it’s clear no one else can really hear him
opposite of nav…. van
Do they perpendiculary make Harry or jj the killers
Arabia
Petition for among us mondays and fifa fridays
0:09 massive forehead
AMONG US VIDEOS >>>>>>>>>>>
Please keep on playing among us!
1:25 Harry hears the word sniffing and gets excited
Jesus loves you all ✝️❤️
I’ve been in Tobi’s position soooo many times it pisses me off Aswell, how can you not rage like that its just pure rage people not listening to you and talking over you 😂😂😂 Harry seriously saying don’t take it personally tho dosent help the situation even though he was concerned 😂😂😂
Jesus is comming soon repent from your sins God loves you all ✝️❤️
We're not going g to talk about jj's  Forehead
LET TOBI TALK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#LetTobiSpeak
Sidemen among us is the best
🤣🤣🤣
Please do Among Us in Real Life 3 🙏🏻
Tobi is such a fucking crybaby. He got so mad about nobody listening to him when they ended up voting out the right person anyways 🙄
i feel for tobi. I am tobi.
Intro was devious
“You got that sweet fucking asshole”😭
Make more imposter videos please live them all
Sidemen playing among us always makes my day 🔥🫶
I love this. Only satan shall know the depression I was experiencing due to a lack of sidemen among us.
We need more among us
Why tobis Instagram is not a thing rn
Josh is too cold. Looked like he threw then killed the whole lobby 🔥
First of all, will always love the intro and second of all, ….baldski
RIP TOBI
I love these among us videos
Viktim talks too much
The contrats between watching like pewds, moist, lud and toast with watching the sidemen is hillarious
I love sideman among us
The snoop "who"really got me 😂😂😂
Tobi so soft holy
Sadness for Tobi his voice was not heard
Harry every amoungus video «i dont know how to play this game»
Probably woulda just quit the game if I were tobi that shit was annoying
Toby is doing some KBD “Lemme speak LEMME SPEAK”
This was honestly one of the funniest videos I’ve ever watched 😂😂😂
Yesssss
Another Banger!! Keep it coming lol
"no homo" this male is having a child
The Sidemen can never use the "Tobi isn't loud enough" excuse ever again. He was literally SHOUTING when only one other person was talking and still no one listened to him.
please put on a bandana jj
I thought jk was bald for a sec 0:08
1 like = 1 prayer for Tobi, we've all been there. You try to speak and nobody listens to you :(
Sidemen can make any game interesting and fun to watch lol
12:30 LMAO🤣🤣🤣  Harry was like: This is my chance to prove them wrong
I’m ngl I used to find these funny, but I stg they just be pissing me off, jj cannot be that stupid so it has to be a character which I’m ngl it’s not as funny anymore, they didn’t let tobi speak at all even while he’s yelling trying to get their attention. Like don’t force being funny, let it happen naturally
How about a free for all imposter but no one knows
YAYYYY MORE AMONG US
Does nobody else feels like Randolph breaks vibe and fun of the sidemen.
Sidemen are the only people who can make among us fun again
JJ needs to go bald it’s not a joke no more
Please get Randolph out! He ruin’s all the sidemen vibe
I just love these videos. LOVE THEM
*THANK YOU JESUS for allowing them to play this*
The Sidemen need to make Among Us merch versions of themselves
This made my day better
How is Harry so god awful at 90% of the games he plays, you’d think after all these “Let’s Plays“ he woulda gotten just a lil better lmaoo
never stop playing amogus, please <3
Play this more it is some of the best sidemen content
I was just watching old sidemen among us lmao this is perfect
Can’t lie when I first saw jjs head I thought it was an edit or a filter
I acc feel for Tobi 😂
tell jj to put that cranium away
toby turning into de bruyne
We just need more of these among us videos
I love these. Please keep it going
Love these videos and love my boy tobi 💛
MORE AMONG US VIDEOS PLEASEEE
Bro the sec this was uploaded I stopped what I was doing and watch this W VIDEO
Tobi getting stressed is too funny he just wanted to say one sentence
I’m out here ready to throw hands for Tobi  I’d have logged off and walked away at that shit
I actually feel tobys anger
Nah Tobi had a poor performance in this video, he’s not been doing well lately and you could see him genuinely getting pissed when he couldn’t talk, I think a lot of tik tok fans have been calling him boring and when he can’t speak and get involved he’s starting to get frustrated, I feel like he was trying rly hard to be funny in the video as well. He just needs to be himself coz he’s such a sound guy who deserves nothing but love
Randy being smart as f*ck Sus of Josh and Ethan directly
Icl I really feel for Tobi in these episodes. No one lets him speak even when he’s shouting. I’d be pissed
YES WE WANT MORE YES YES YES
Cant tell if josh did that kill for a reason but that was sick play 😂
Tobi needs to learn to speak for himself
1:23   Ethan: what was he holding his pocket? 😂😂😂😂
JJ's theory at 10:00 was big brain amazing ahahahaha
Do more gta
KSI: "it's not nav, it's the opposite of nav" Randy: "Van" 💀💀💀💀 Classic
Tobi had himself on mute for sure
JJ should wear his bandana and cover his forehead without it mans iq drops 100 fold
JJ threw SO HARD in this video
2:31
I love how Harry is just trying to figure things out walking and hitting the walls and bloody seeing clip of Harry seeing Simon teleporting and didn't know he vented
What happened to Tobi
I was screaming with Tobi 💀
Nobody gonna talk about how JJ has a airspace on his forehead.
The gods heard our prayers
Love this series but JJ interrupting and shouting over people is kinda annoying at this point
I felt bad for Tobi when his boys wernt listing to him, he got proper mad 🤣
Yes among us is back
jjs hairline.....
Tobi channeling his inner debruyne "LET ME TALK"
Lolol so good.
Ngl JJ's forhead caught me off guard
They all need to learn to shut Tf up and let ppl speak aha someone has to say it. Leaving tobi out lol
Randolph chain smokes a pack of cigarettes before every sidemen video!! Yellow stonessss
Take this Ellum guy out
MY FAVORITE SERIES😍
I was waiting for KSI and W2S masterclass
Where is KSI's bandana?! But in all honesty, I love these vidios, they are awsome.
Poor tobi. justice for tobi.
Jesus my eyes instantly went like 👀 when I saw jjs forehead I was expecting the bandana but lord was it not
JJ looking like that alien from that Reddit video.
"SIDEMEN AMONG US BUT EVERYONE IS THIRD IMPOSTER" So basically it's just a regular sidemen among us
damn i forgot how big jj forehead was lmaaao
Josh threw, L
“I’d love to kill you but I can’t” Proceeds to kill him literally 5 seconds later!!! JJ what are you doing man
Perfect nickname opportunity missed: Detective Dolph
It’s so funny that no one listens to tobi
First time Ethan wasn't third imposter
Loving the return of Among Us
Can Ethan stop getting the SS cause he never uses it and I wanna see people using it again it’s way funnier
Jj is so academically stupid. No wonder he became a youtuber and artist
Poor Tobi reminded me of Kevin De Bruyne. No one let him talk😔
poor toby
You guys are shit friends to tobi when you play games especially JJ he always has to talk and be the center of attention
The only thing I could look at was JJs forhead 😂
Also among us and gta series are the best in moresidmen. Please keep doing them often
i hope tobi is okay ❤️
Tobi is so stressed 😂
josh talks different when hes imposter
Jj is the definition of brain damage
Anyone see Ethan’s card swipe photo
Think Tobi needs to turn his mic up, people were able to speak over him even when he was shouting
Like we have Sidemen Sundays, I would really like to see 'Among Us Sundays' as well!!
❤️🌚
Jj killin ellym was so dumb
Consistency !!
WE.NEED.MORE.PLEASEEEEE
Gotta love JJ embracing his forehead. Goals
"i do have fun with my friends" not for long though 💀
lmao why did Tobi get so pressed? It's just a game
tobi is the middle child
I feel tobi’s struggles😭😭
So sad that toe b gets ignored all the time
Sidemen among us is so good and so funny, they should not stop these videos.
Please replace randy with someone else
Can’t lie Randy needs a new toothbrush 😭
Jj’s forehead>>>>>>>>
11:26

Honestly I could watch them play among us forever.
hi
Nice triple kill for just at the end
I don't deserve this 😍🥺
I fucking love these, i been binge watching this shit for weeks now!
What does Harry say at 7:33 ?
Jj saying harry killed without seeing his name move is peak ksi
Pleaseeeeeeee more among usssssss
Why does randy blink so much when he talks 😂
Jj's been getting real comfortable without the bandana.
Randy wearing a Zerkaa hat ❤
oi tobi just shout man tf

SaucyChangas
Poor Tobi, I feel his frustration. Man just wants to say one thing and the lobby starts shouting.
Among us goat
Everyone is sus
Bruh! Bmt jj’s forehead is seriously that spacious! 😂🤣 I could seriously slap his forehead and still have space for the bandana 😂🤣😂 bruh! Soo much space
I LOVE SIDEMEN AMOUNG US
I feel so bad for TOBI 😂🥺
Tobi venting in front of Ellum and then getting pissed when Ellum thought he was an impostor was a highligjt
Tobi is such a baby. At least he knows he’s a boring person
Just as I was binge watching all the old Sidemen Among Us videos,they dropped a new one. Thank you Sidemen for making my day❤️.
Playing among us with jj is gotta be one of the hardest things to do
nah tobi got so unlucky this video i feel so bad
Bruh Tobi is a youtuber yet he doesn't know how to talk it's so annoying this man is shouting as soon as someone relevant is talking and when he gets ignored he's saying no one listens to me.
i feel so bad for tobi 🤣he needs to get a louder mike like the funny mike 😂
It’s amazing to watch these guys play this game, I genuinely love it
Jjs forhead is covering my whole screen cant see nothing.
Randy: Jj you freestyle why it’s not you then  Lol
I thought jj’s forehead was an edit so sorry jj
Sounds stupid But I’m proud of you not wearing your bandanna JJ (KSI) your forehead is fine 😂🙏🏻
Respect to KSI for trying to get over his insecurity about his forehead. We see u dawg, I’m supporting u all the way💯
They Keven De Bruyne'd Tobi.
These can easily be 40 min long! Tobi needs to be imposter and a win 😂 thanks for posting
SUIIIIII
‘It’s the opposite of Nav’  ‘Van’   No one else clocked it but I’m crying 😂😂
I’m just imagining Tobi was muted😂😂

MORE, WE LOVE THIS!
6:27 Are we seriously gonna brush past this!?
ellum and randy are the best regulars
Im guessing just the only one that didnt turn off his discord overlay lol

Bro, Heathrow airport is on JJ's head

Tobi i feel u man
My love for Randolph has hit new heights, funniest person on YT right now!
YEEES MORE AMONG USSSS
Nobody: Randolph:Shapeshitter hee hee hee
Ngl i love among us vids
Jjs forehead My god
Tobi is low-key so underrated as an individual
Yeeees more among ussss!
Love it keep doing well with among us videos
Honestly funny vid but kinda sucks that they all ignore Tobi and barely acknowledge him. That’s got to be mentally and emotionally tiring:/
The sidemen + Randolph seem to be the only people than can make a good among us video these days lol
Miniminter could have saved that game
Poor Tobi man’s can’t even talk hahaha
We want more Among Us! Keep it coming. Pause
Sidemen among us is so good
I can't fathom lmao, this was jokes
Keep the amount us going
MAKE MORE
Genuinely got shocked at the sight of ksi's gigantic forehead.
14:20
jj forhead hahah
I’m like 67% sure the sidemen are of average intelligence but they are so fucking stupid in among us
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still waiting for Tobi to to be the imposter since desember 2021............
Tobi is right, I genuinely don’t remember an episode of among us where he was imposter.
First round dough, randy even said harry left with him, poor Harry
poor tobi lmao
issue is, when it comes to Innocents, they instantly vote them out.. when its evil people, they never vote them first time so more die.
I lov this series but pls also bring back football challenges
Put the bandana back on 😂
KEEP UP the good videos. Last 3 were bangers
I actually felt angry for Tobi when he was trying to speak. Its genuinely annoying watching/listening to people talk over others saying nothing of value when someone can't even get one sentence in
Goated
Please more among us
Simon getting mad at JJ for calling him miniminter 😂
10:03 that was quick from Randy
Want 10mil subscribers , Do more Sidemen among us videos.
make them longerrrrr
06:25 naaaah
One of the best series they ever made
they stay doing tobi so dirty
Love the video edits😂 especially on jj
Why is the top left of JJ’s screen always blurred?🤣
Viks skin is clear af
Kai forhead is massive
pleeaseeeee continue this series
we all love this so much please do more among us
Please do more Among Us
4:34
Among Us Videos are THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
Bruh JJs forehead blocking the sun 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Kinda crazy how JJ forehead takes up 99.9% of the webcam
Sidemen Among Us FTW
Lol 😂😂😂 I can see JJ forehead shin
this is why tobi is the worst sideman
Poor tobi can’t speak haha
Cold
A lobby of shitters
Was Randy talkin or rappin, I'll never get to know...
Bro I love jj imposter 😂❤️
The foreheads mad
Love this content 🤩
Elite
Tobi woke up in KDB mode
Bring back jackbox split the room
Bro they really need to start paying attention to tobi he always gets ignored or spoken over in so many videos kinda feel bad for him that type of stuff can actually hurt
Poor old Tobs 🥲
U have to play more than 5 times to get IMPOSTER Tobi, play more lol 😂 plus we wanna see u guys do this more often
God I love this game. Though this video title could be *any* Sidemen Among Us video lmao
I like seeing Amogus characters be sooo cute omg!!
I like that JJ's going without the headband🎉. Gives off King energy, if you ask me.
No one ever cares about what Tobi has to say 😂
I feel like tobi has kinda took the place vik was in back in the days i mean he is being ignored and he is kinda quiet and picked on
Ong tobi is right u know I haven't seen the man be imposter like ever
I relate with Tobi Can't get a single word in😢
I acctually cant get over the size of JJs forehead    Not that I can talk but ah well
GIVE ME MORE
11:58 the photo in the wallet 😭😭
Continue this series pls
We need some proximity among us
Aww poor Tobi lol 😂
Idk why Tobi waits for a space to speak when everyone just shouts over each other anyway. Just shout what you've got to say and keep shouting it until they listen, I guarantee it'll annoy them enough to shut up and listen.
Omg I've been waiting for more sidemen among us. This is one of my favourite series☺
Why does Vik always shake in his chair when speaking
I actually was triggered for Tobi when they wouldnt let him speak lol
Hmmmm, I wonder, is Tobi turned down too much in Discord when they do group calls? Cause he was shouting and it was like no one could hear him. THe person who edits the videos might know if they have to add a volume gain for him during editing
That forehead
I know its only a game but I think Tobis frustration was more that he was falling on deaf ears when he was trying to speak.
The intro❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Why’s Tobi toxic
Them bunny teeth randy has had me dead💀
Tobi be like emotional damage
Poor tobi…
JJ looking like Melly YNW
Jj definitely got a ghost writer
Love sidemen among us… one of the top tier more sidemen videos
Behz : "I hate being an impostor" *5 seconds later* Becomes an Impostor  Edit : Thanks guys for 2k likes
Tobi low-key got violated this session
14:22
Lowkey mad disrespectful when they ignore tobi
Please play with vr when it comes out
Why does tobi always play victim
" body on floor"   1:12  Tobi: " aint gonna be in the sky is it"
Oh so it’s ok for Randy to go no homo wow real cool Randy r u against gay people
Feel for Tobi man everyone just speaks over him 😕
We start the video with THAT FOREHEAD....
U think logan paul coming on this among us maybe soon?
Tobi is like us in public lobbies, no one listens
JJ's hairline is not normalll wtffff ahahahahahhahahhahahahahhaaaha
0:09 I’m sorry but  jjs forehead just made me die 😂
BRO LET TOBI SPEAK THAT RUIEND THE WHOLE THING
Keep these videos going. Great entertainment
It's too funny when tobi a ant speak🤣🤣
WE NEED MORE
Ellum has the most punchable face, after Trump of course
Love these, they are so entertaining and please keep on doing them🙏
Jj’s forehead tho
tobis gone black out on social media this game really hurt him lol they just don’t acknowledge his existence lol😂
Randy made this video 😂
W randy
josh is actually the worst at among us
Simon acting like his gf forgot to call him babe 😂😂
Sponsored by Ethan 😂😂😂😂😂😂 the best third imposter
I was mad along with Tobi lol
VIVA RONALDO RUNNING DOWN THE WING LET THE CONFERENCE LEAGUE SING.........VIVA RONALDO
I can relate to tobi's pain of trying to get a word in, bless you lad
They should have put a warning at the start of the video for jj’s forehead. I wasn’t prepared whatsoever
Ksi's forhead is masive wtf
Mad funny😭
10:10 best moment imo😭😭
we need a funeral for JJ's hairline ong
Big forehead sorry had to say it
New Tobi rage comp 🤣👌
You really should put a disclaimer before showing JJs forehead😂😂
I'm proud of jj for just going without the bandana, must of been a pain man
Tobi: "I love playing with my friends" Also Tobi: "WHY WONT ANYONE LET ME SPEAK!?"
10:02 "Its not nav but the opposite of nav" "van"
tobi just needs to talk man😂 spends half the time yelling that he can’t get a word out and can’t speak, like bro use that time to yell what ur trying to say
More sidemen among us pls xx
14:02 literally can’t breathe anymore
:)
Is it just me but at the start of the video when Ethan swiped his card there was a picture of his pregnant reveal ❤️xx
I swear the crewmates Are always dumb 💀
JJ just wants us to get used to his massive forehead by making us see it more
comments r so boring now always kids commenting the same thing
There should be a role in the game called "third imposter"
Bro I feel for Tobi no one ever listens to him
BANGER
I want too see pro clubs!!!!
Tobi should have just said I am engineer instead of I was dancing infront of u….
The edits with the vents killing me haha
#justicefortobi💔💪🏾
anyone notice the picture in the wallet when ethan did swipe card at the beginning?
Kick tobi out of sidemen
poor tobi I love him :D
Yo
Randy is a fan favourite
JJ should bring back the bandana.
Tobi you brought that upon urself man c'mon it's just a game why u have to be med😆❤️❤️
nah i cant even breathe at 13:27
the ‘we will just run it zerka’ had me creased 😂😂😂
The pictures in the wallets when they swipe admin are so good

" Randy: "Body on the floor..." Toby : "It's not gonna be in the sky is it....."  😂😂😂Toby started with shmmmoke
jj getting too confident with his forehead
MOREEEEERRR
Feel bad for tobzz
"You had sussy chungus juice all over you, and I was trying to lick that all up" Bro Randy is the best in these videos man
The opposite of NAV. VAN. Randy is funny
I would throw hands if I was ignored like Tobi smh
I really hope Tobi was just muted on call by accident and not them actually ignoring him like that coz thats a violation
This is my break n stress reliever from finals
JJ looks like Deji here
"JJ you freestyle why it's not you then" might be one of the smartest comments Randy's ever come out with, funny as fuck
Bro randy has chipmunk teeth
I WANT THIS GAME TO BECOME A TREND AGAIN ITS SOOO FUN
love this content
I can’t stop watching these over and over
KSI’s vain oh his massive forehead is an image I wanna forget
I love the among us videos especially the ones irl

JJ: It's not Nav but the opposite of Nav Randolph: VAN  😂😂😂😂
I would roast how stupid they all are but then i realize that they're all richer and more relevant than me.
JJ's forehead😂
More of this please. Less of that horrible first 3 seconds though
Josh did a throwbi he just had to split the vote and him and behz get a double kill and win
Feel Tobi’s pain man :(
love the among us please keep doing them!
I know this is practically beating a dead horse at this point but I honestly thought the 5head memes were overexaggerated but then i saw ksi 8 seconds in
Tobi all vid ‘let me taaalk’
Ummm JJ
Oof tobi kinda salty In this one must’ve been having a bad day
Was Tobi on mute or something lmaooo
Josh dropped a "git gud" on em at the end to add insult to injury. haha love it. Nerds Master Race !
I wouldn't mind this becomming an among us channel. Love these vids!
among us is meant for the sidemen.
Man we all need a friend like Tobi in our lives.
What on earth is jjs forehead 💀💀
“you had sussy chungess juice all over you, I was trynna lick it off” -Randy
Poor tobi they are just ignoring him now
Ksi “ I’d love to kill you but I can’t “    5 seconds later kills him 😂😂😂
"You have a sweet fuckin asshole bro" - Harry 😂😂
If I was tobi I would of been shouting down that mic 😂😂😂
YES, SIDEMEN AMONG US!!! This is like a goddamn drug
JJ is so dumb on among us and that's the most fun part when he defends himself being the impostor 😂😂😂
But jjmy nigga

Jjs forhead
among us is so good
Baldski is making a return

Why did they stop playing with shape shifter on ?
Just go bald ffs JJ
That foreheaddddd
ÂzZÂB
I feel so bad for tobi man
JJ acts like a old man playing video games
Poor Tobi, you can see why he’s the most boring Sideman, not even his own mates know he’s there ! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why is jj's top left blurred
Bring back among us
tobi’s destined for boredness
can you make an among us video using names like for example me, who, that guy, he etc. just to make it super confusing lmao. I think it would be funny as hell. s/o to the people coming from randy's ylyl video with this idea in the video mix ;D
Need this during half time in the United game. Much better entertainment.
justice for tobi
Tbjzl vents in front of someone and gets mad when accused of being impostor lol
Ethan : kills Simon Also Ethan 5m later :I'm soo sad Simon isn't here
so gased they’re bringing this game back im always rewatching the old one
11:30, poor tobi contracted the "i'm a scientist, how can i help ?" syndrome :))))))))
lmaoooo tobi man thats peak that got me  boiled up
PLEASE DO MORE AMONG US VIDEO I Love EM
Let tobi speak man😂😂😂
Tobi's too kind for his mates lol
I swear whoever is the guardian angel does nothing
The only reason these are so entertaining is because the majority of the Sidemen are so fucking stupid.🤣
Least JJ is funny cuh bloody ell he’s clapped
New Toby rage comp coming soon lmao
Justice for Tobi✊
11:53 Elite edit. Editor's deserve a raise. Vik's Proposal photo in the Wallet
Please keep doing this videos they are quality
ksi is a bit minisimper
y'all should never stop playing Among us
Genuinely felt for Tobi. No one listened to him. He just wanted to finish a sentence 💯
They not letting Tobi speak is so irritating, they just shouting over everybody.
You really need to play with Jester on. Would make things really interesting
Ngl sideman among us>>>
https://youtu.be/T6b7o6K0kmI
I’m so happy
I love this!!!! Keep them coming!!!!!!
Forhead!
i think jj is starting to overcome his forehead and embrace his body xD
I honestly feel bad for Tobi, literally got ignored like he wasn't there
They should play the vr version when it comes out
I legit just watched every single among us video hoping for more to come
poor tobi
How is JJ still so bad at this game it doesnt make any sense
Please never stop with this series😭💯
Do among us and make that Bag.
The "its only a game Y u have to b mad" was my last straw for Tobi man it made me quite mad 😭
https://youtu.be/j95u8cBlxos
Justice for Tobi lmao he ain’t deserve this frrr
We need to keep these going, could you imagine playing with fans xD
That forehead tho JJ…
Just let Tobi speak his thing.
I think it’s time for a 10 player golf
About time!!!!
Did anyone notice when Ethan does the card swipe there's a photo of him and faith in the wallet? Edit: Vikk's proposal photo is there when he does card swipe
Bro JJ has a absolute melon of a head
aww tobi :(
The only reason JJ and Harry are bad at this game is because they're both stupid.   But props to them for accepting that and trying to use it as their excuse when they get called out for being imposter.
JJ's forehead is bigger than my future
the forehead on that man! geeez
ksi literally has no brain cells, its so entertaining
my entire logical being gets rattled anytime time JJ opens his mouth
Yes ❤🎉 finally
A good video to watch after a tire full day at school 😪
Among us vids should be uploaded everyday screw all the other content
Y’all did Tobi so dam dirty in this video it got quite triggering 😭 i feel for Mr Brown man
Among us with the sidemen is easy when KSI is the killer not because he is bad at it but because he will be voted out even when he is not the killer.
JJ is not the best at the game
I’m so glad y’all keeping with the among us!! It’s such bants with y’all
Fuckin hell, i have the exact same relationship as Tobi to this fucking game.... FML
do more shapeshifter videos
When JJ notices Ellum and the vent😭
bruh let tobi speak man
God bless tobi
I think we got enough among us for now, lets continue with some gta vids
JUSTICE FOR TOBIIIIIII
0:33 Ethan's wallet having a photo of him and his wife with a photo of the baby
Thingswithan
neglected tobi man hilarious
Lol was just watching the previous sidemen among us, glad im here 1 hour early ✌️
tobi at the start of the vid: " oh i do have fun with my friends" at the end: "i dont wanna play this fucking game anymore"
I thought JJ went bald at the start its been so long since I've seen him for a full vid without a bandana?!
Tobi had no chance
*yes*
right from the start i got blinded but fat neeks forehead i need to take this to court i couldve died
Why did I expect the pasta line
JJs forehead looks bigger than usual today
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! THE AMONG US SERIES SHALL CARRY ON!!!!!!
Bro love from India thanks for among us
Felt bad for Tobi but his raging was hilarious
We love it here
Poor Tobi we love you 🥲
To be fair to tobi, everyone was talking over him. Must be annoying
It’s kinda mad how often jj yawning at the start gets me to yawn
OMGGG LETS GOOO THE BEST SERIES

harry at 7:07 has me dying LMFAOOO
Randy's getting good at the game

15:46 Tobi's sigh of defeat 🤣🤣

0:29 & 11:53 👌🏻
It was funny jj saying miniminter
i like the sidemen among us vids
Love watching u guys doing among us please do more
As much as Tobi’s energy was ‘funny’ it wasn’t for him. It was breaking him mentally.
What happened to jj's forehead
Simons new laugh is annoying
KSI sees ethan run away from body. KSI: ITS ELLUM Viewers: (all slap heads)
I’m convinced Tobi’s mic is muted at this point
Please don’t ever stop among usss
i am very excited for MWII
Tobi reminds me of de brunye trying to talk
Among us is allways a banger
I died when tobi said suck urself to ellum. He's 2 funny man
LETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Josh went total serial killer mode in that second game. 3 kills in one round
>:(
I feel tobi's pain i would have popped a blood vessel at that point
do a vid where no matter what you vote a certain person but you believe every thing they say at the meeting then vote them.the person you pick can not no about this idea
Damn, I can land a passanger plane on ksi's forhead
Please make it a permanent series!! Or as much as possible
9:50 Knowledge at its best
WE LOVE SIDEMEN AMONG US
FUCK YES AMONG US DAILY
Vikstars wallet in among us has a pic of him and his wife lol
sidemen among us is the best
FREE CONTENT TYSM
We want more among us.
At first I thought JJ was wearing a bald cap, but it was just him not wearing a bandana
Nice seeing Big Behz again... Appreciate the content as always. :)
Tobi, just scream for them to shut the fuck up next time
JJ's forehead is longer than a flight to New York from London
Tobi was pissed 🤣 🤣 🤣
Lol randy
put the bandana back on
Miniminter is the goat
Tobi don’t take this the wrong way but ur just boring In general to watch that’s probably why you get voted off or killed and no one listens
why does jj keep exposing his forehead 😭😭🤣
No one questioning wtf is going on with KSI's haircut? 😂 Man looks like he's bald
Best game for the sidemen to play in my opinion
Tobi out here like Kevin De Bruyne
Guys.. Tobi is ok!
At first I was skeptical about Tobi blaming Ellum but when I thought about it  it actually made sense if instead of blaming Tobi they heard him out they would've focused on what Randy was saying
Tobi bringing them KDB vibes ahaha "Let me tallkkk"
Ksi is the dumbest player ong
glad to see the among us vids back!!
love these videos but i honestly want sidemen to play phasmophobia
Make an among us in real life 3! 😂😂😂😂
back to back i swear making my week
Holy shit look at JJ’s hairline
Best video in youtube, its sad to know somebody never watch sidemen among us
This is what we love please keep Among us series going ❤️

Viks laugh is so funny. JJ is stupid
Dective randy too good gotta love him ❤️😂
Eyo JJ cover ya head.      Jkin bro it looks great..
JJ's Forehead though HAHAHA
LET TOBI SPEAK 🥺
These guys playing Traitors in Salem would be hilarious
KSI - the only bald man to have a haircut
It is so funny that I've been watching sidemen among us videos then they post one
These videos make me soooooo happy!
wtf, YouTube actually removed like as well lmao
Tobi kinda made things awkward lol
The bryzgalov clip at the end😂
Tobi needs to increase his volume
10:30 hahahahhahahahhahh
they are bringing it back 😤
Hope Tobi is keeping well! ❤️

Justice for tobi

Hoping Tobi is okay & will feel better soon!! Sending him love!
These aren’t entertaining they should put ssundee toast and biffle in the loby
Tobi turning to Kevin De Bruyne
Hope Toby's doing fine. Felt genuinely sad for Toby 😭
sus
really did not realise how swole jj’s forehead is
I love it when the sidemen play Among Us.
Sidemen + troops+ beta squad???
I felt tobis frustration, I was just sitting here going shut the f up, let tobi speak lol
Tobi is the actually wholesome guy in the world 🥺🥺🥺
Ellum>Tobi
among us
i just finished eating fuckkk mann
The first game was just Randy being smart and Harry flirting with Simon. 😂
I LOVE AMONG US VIDEOS!!!!
Sad to see miniminter getting killed all those times. It’s a shame cause miniminter is a gamer. If only miniminter’s friends didn’t bully him so much than miniminter may have survived a round
The harry face

Why does JJ not wear bandanas anymore?

Anyone know why Tobi deleted his Instagram?? I Hope all is well with him 🙏 ❤
Hide and seek in Ronaldo's house
How do they get worse every time they play this game.
That forehead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“i do have fun with my friends” Tobi🐐
Tobi when they aren’t listening to you breathe intensely into the mic always works for me
#petemymeat
KSI's eyes look small in comparison to his huge and I mean HUGE forehead
TOBI NEEDS TO BE CLOSER TO MIC
Why is Joshs eye turning yellow...?
13:46 Top tier Moment from Josh right here 😂😂😂
SIDEMEN why the sound in these 2 among us videos (this and the last one) is so low???

We are being treated by these back to back Among Us video’s
poor jj put his whole heart and soul into these games yet does not use his brain lmao
something in the way
why has jj still not activated windows oml
nah tobi is right, they could’ve avoided most of it if Ellum didn’t accuse him, he wasn’t being a bad loser
KSI your forehead is crazy big
make more of these there so good
literally nobody:  the greatest thing i have witnessed in my life: jj showing his forehead without anybody asking for it
I can feel for Tobi you know  xD
I think jj’s bandana is in the laundry for days.

Among Us goated
God, that second round was absolute shithousery lmao
Broo , no one talkin' bout , JJ'S FOREHEAD !!!???
LETSSSSSSSSS GOOOO I LOVE THESEEEE
LET TOBI SPEAK 🗣
Honestly just turn more sidemen into an among channel🤣🤣🤣 they really are my favourite more sidemen videos
Man I feel for Tobi. I wish he could participate more on these vids but I know everything he just gets shouted over :( Tobi you should turn up your mic volume so a ridiculously high level
♥️
I am not the impostor, I’d rather eat your pAsTa😎
You guys should play Goose Goose Duck. Imposters have different rolls with different abilities (assassin can shoot during voting if they know someones role, professional leaves invisible bodies, ninja can kill 2 at once, ect), crew also have roles like sheriff, vigilante, detective and many more, and there's neutral roles like falcon who is a lone serial killer or Dodo who is like a joker that pretends to be imposter to get voted out to win. There's also several maps and some have environmental kills like boulders crushing people and chandeliers crashing. I think the sidemen would have a great time playing it. It's like town of salem and among us had an awesome baby.
They know among us videos are their best videos 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Among Us is so dead and boring but they make it so fun to watch
we do feel bad for tobi
shit players make for an enjoyable video
This video made my day❤️🤝
Its ellum
Yessssss fuckkkk yessss I’ve been rewatching all the old vids I watched when I was baked cus I can’t really remember them but they hella funny 😂🙌🏽
We need more of these with proximity chat ladsss
Is tobi alright
One day jj will have 1000000IQ just to prove a point
Tobi doesn’t know how to speak over people. When will he learn?😭
People say among us are dead but these lads make it class
Tobi is me, Tobi I feel your pain man d
YES YES we love this
I was gonna sleep but... All right then~~~  Sup!~ I'm Zero!~
These man dont let tobi speak
Nah why jj u bringing hell upon yourself by taking off bandana
MAKE MORE OF THEMMMMM
Gives me summut to watch till fast opens
THESE ARE THE BEST MORE SDMN VIDEOS
WAIT STOP✝️ITS NOT TO LATE TO TURN TO GOD BUT SOON IT WILL BE✝️YOU’RE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW REPENT AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL AND PRAY 🙏
I like when they play among us but I miss gta 😢
I'll honestly never get sick of these videos
Justice for tobi
Ayo i wouldn't be mad if they even do among us video the rest of the life. Cause these are goated
Tobi needs to stop playing the victim man. Pisses me off.
They should really do a modded among us session
ball
shout out tobi, you the man!
Dont stop these videos. Amazing content
JJ: it's not nav it's the opposite of nav Randy: van
Sidemen among us always delivers! 🔥
Bru they spawn w a 100k views
that was hella sick can't wait for more keep it up 😂
Let’s goooo
Poor Tobi man, just trying to talk and everybody talking over him lmaob
11:15 tobi is too funny 😭😭😭😭
Damn tobis really crying
just admit it, the sidemen are making all of us wish this game goes viral all over again..
Bring back Lachy, Lazar & Elliot for the next among us!
Sidemen among us videos is all I want in my life
Just had a break up and I’ve been crying all night and can’t take my mind of her. Even watching the sidemen videos is not enough because we would often watch it together. Depression is not good man I’m dying
I cant with JJ lmfao.   Dude always kill on the dumbest situation possible.
Dang angry tobi rare sight
Keep them coming. The context is superb. 👏
PLS EVERY WEEK
JJ put the bandana back on pls
I feel so bad for Tobi :(
i feel so bad for tobi, he doesnt get to speak lol, enjoy these vids
.
jj calling simon miniminter JOKES
Literally watched all the old among us vids and I see this. Came in clutch
11:32 tobi’s turning into de bruyne
Lads, is tobi okay ? I don't wanna lose one of the most wholesome man on yt.
Honestly, I feel sorry for Tobi lmao, Vikk has to literally eat his mic in the chaos for people to listen to him and no one listens to Tobes even when he does that lol
This might be the funniest Sidemen Among Us video. Had me dying lmaoo
AMONGUS🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶
Jj: idk where it is bruv it's just opposite of Nav  No one :  Randy : VAN
Yes
I’d beg for these vids to be an hour and a half
JJ tryna make his forehead a norm now lol my mann
Love the daily posts
Pls do an among us collab with markiplier  Leave a like if u want this
idc if its not a new thing anymore, i just want to say that i apreciate the KSI roaring intro
YESSSS MOOORRREEE
Damn these Tobi lines hurt now...
13:00 Tobi’s auto tune kicks in
Toby wasn’t really getting mad over the game he was getting upset that no one ever listens to him…. :/ poor guy it would be hard competing with such big personalities like them but I think he goes about speaking in a bad way he tries to talk over ppl if you follow the flow of the conversation there’s always a way to get in there and be apart of it. He seems like he’s constantly fighting the flow to get his words in which just isn’t working for him clearly
Ellum's iq is honestly something around 10-15...
The fact that the editors put Vikk’s engagement in his wallet is so sweet
How is JJ getting worse and worse on this game!
Josh is a beast
Early gang
keep up the among us im loving it
Thanks guys …. Not trying to ask for too much but pls let’s keep “among us” going , it’s literally the only game I love watching ❤️❤️❤️❤️
For the past three hours I’ve literally just been watching previous sidemen among us. How strange 😂
Sad to see Zerkaa let behz get voted out.
Justice for Tobi
Megamind is back!
Love the photo edits during the card task
ayo , anyone knows what's up with Tobi ? he's deactivated his ig account
Do a different map once in a while
Sigh...this just pissed me off poor Tobi
Bro Randy have way too much Brain
Who else thought this was a compilation lol.
Tobi did a great KDB impression 11:14
OH YESSS BABYYYYY
0:29 Editors always killing it
Anyone else notice the pictures in the wallet during the card swipe? Nice detail!!!
Among us is my fav thing on this channel
Props to JJ for embracing his forehead 👍
This treat just made my night 🙏🏻
Notice what Tobi does in the recent among us upload and this one... He's so annoyed and the way he speaks like he has no friends... idk
Its soo stressfull seeing them play among us
nice.
I feel Tobi’s frustration
How tf did the world let KSI get famous?? All he provides to the sidemen is being loud and rich... Harry is the funniest, Josh is the street smarts, Vikk the book smarts (and cheekiness), Tobi is the mediator with mello vibes, Simon reeks havoc through sarcastic wit... JJ just sleeps, yells, and has money
hope tobi is doing well ❤️
if jj had a picture of thhe maps framed in his room i bet he would actually stay in
I don't think I'll ever get tired of sideman among us, keep em coming
They gotta milk a game until it's completely dry
I love this!!!!
this is probably one of the most funniest among us video ive seen
Randy looks like a chipmunk 😂
I'm guessing Ethan is a 3rd imposter...😭😭
Yo, does any one have good Netflix recommendations? Thanks
Do among us vr when it comes out on quest 2
We need GTA V
JJ's forehead is the third impostor
How do they know I’ve been binging all of these lately
I was kinda pissed ,that they wouldnt let tobi talk
Yes Among us is The best of more sidemen
😂😂
😂😂😂😂
omg you have to continue this seires dunno how to spell that but great viedos keep it up <3
sussy chungus
Among us videos are the best who else agrees
Unpopular opinion: sidemen are finished
5Head
sussy chungus is quite intelligent
Feel for Tobi he was genuinely pissed 🥺
0:05 Yo wtf is that forehead my G, Is there something I don't know about? 😂
MORE OR WEEKLY AMONG US VIDS PLS IM OBSESSED
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Ellum: ”Prime is not killing me today”   Gets killed like 10 seconds after
Randy: where is it? JJ: idk how to explain it, it’s the opposite of nav Randy:VAN
Tobi 🤝 De Bruyne: not being able to speak
The frustration I felt when Tobi couldn't speak LMAO
Keep doing among us, you're the only people I can watch anyone else and im like get over it it's 10 years old 🤣🤣🤣
randy needs teeth whitening
Among us is always elite
LESS GOOOOO
Bangers
Let tobi speak 😭😭😭
I feel like they’re running out of title ideas
Tobi whisper screams lmao. He gotta let it all go and just shout if he wants to be listened to.
i feel so sorry for toby 🤣🤣🤣
More among us 🔥
I was expecting the de bruyne let me talk ngl
tobi was fucked over today
Nobody was listening to toe b
I'm 15 and I live seeing middle aged men play among us😂
Wow again? You all are rollin
I feel bad for Tobi😂
Why’s jj got that shiny thing on show
Proof to the editor for putting the picture of Ethan and his gf on card swipe
Among us is you best 2nd channel content by far
Back to back among us videos 🔥🔥❤❤   Sidemen always coming thru for the fans
I feel bad for tobi
im so impressed of editors when they added those picturse in swipe cars task, the real goats
Perfect timing video, just got in bed as I start work at 3am, sat on my phone for 20 mins before I sleep and Sidemen upload a video.
By everyone they really mean Ethan
FINALLY OGMEH I LOVE THESE VIDEOS😢
I honestly prefer Among Us videos ahead of Sidemen Sunday
