Won’t fit
Hang a welding blanket on the back wall and back in.
Lambo .. All day Everyday
Wait they say pause in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿? Lmfao that’s what’s up 😂😂
What did the cop want.
It doesn't fit
Good for you my friend..Lambo is the best ever….🇨🇦👍
fit
No
Has he sold this car ? I’ve been looking for one to buy
💓
Yes bus in thete
If you have the dimensions of the garage it's not hard to know if a car will fit !
I think its time to extend the garage out🤭
Spot on.. 😬
just install a giant rubber absorber to wall so can push ur car against the wall
Tak enteni ning channel e carwow yo
Maybe the ultimae can fit
Make a soft leather pad to stop in exactly the place u want. Front bumper will be touching the pad without any damage 🤪
Check five o in the back stealing some recognition time 🤣🤣
fit
Яни ты красава на карвале с тобой даже веселий драги
Now that’s rich peoples issues 😜😜
One word: Snug! 😆
Pliz take it for a drag race against Matt
I wish I had a lambo, Yanni make my dream come true ❤️
No 😂, I don’t think it’d fit
try the cayenne pls
Yes
👽
You can get a jumbo jet in there 👍
That's surprising I though avendator would be bigger than urus
None of my business dear
I believe it’s woulds
The thing with an aventador is, i only has one clutch, so it cant creep.
will fit
From your garage doors I would build outwards 2 bricks then make a little overhang. Then you will have more room.
I think I would have to extend the garage a bit more so you can fit bigger cars in for the future 👌🏼👍🏼
Yes will fit ✅
Make sure the new Ferrari SUV are next to see if it fits or not👀
I love Yianni and his videos but that Urus’s colour is making it look like a Tesla 🤣.  Black was 100x better imo
lol I don't think it fits ...😅😅😅
No
Race this with car wow
Insane Urus!! Look at this one 😲😲😲https://youtu.be/7BexHp_msfQ
Did anyone notice the police in the background 🤣
I think it’ll fit
What do you do?
Def fit
Have you heard off Yamborghini high
What was the police doing back there?
fit
I can't get over the fact that the garage door drops onto the rubber floor which should be inside only, rather than the concrete, leaving the inside exposed to elements (be it natural or otherwise).
I hope you don’t crash your car
yianni come on man buy a ultimae
Look at his private police 3:15!!
Yiannis problem is his half mil car doesn’t fit. My problem is finding a second hand polo because someone wrote it off
Να την χαίρεσαι ρε συ !
It's going to fit in 💯
A bunch of rich middle aged men playing with their expensive toys. We've really progressed as a society!
All the money in the world, but zero common sense  Buy a tape measure Tuning out, for good
The ultimae is crazy🔥
Someone also needs to edit the clip properly!
Rich people problems ehh
This is a disaster waiting to happen with space this right. Please get ur garage extended this is lame trying to fit in stuff like that
Alternatively, use a tape measure, Not exactly rocket science.
I think it will
i really dont think it will fit could just make a nice extension on the garage
So when are you going to let Matt launch the new Lambo? lol
It’ll fit So it must sit
I think it'll fit...no cheating here I paused the vid mate😂
Will a corsa fit?
Ahh nil has done dental work on me in southend 🤣
Yh the gran one will fit
Jheez content has really gone down hill. A 7 minute video on whether a car will fit in a garage… breathtaking stuff 🥱
In there like swim wear
So now if u want some thing on other side of the garage  and the garage door is closed then just go through the car 😅😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😆😆😆😆😆😉😉😉
Just get Daniel back to extend the garage door out a bit :)
Haha now do it with everything else also in the garage #thenwontfit lol
Glad to see life’s important questions get answered on this channel. 🤣
Wow the wrapping the car business must be doing well.. 👍🏻
Don’t care
Attach a mirror to the wall so you don’t need a second person when trying to park the beast
I don’t know why I’m so invested if some guy I’ve never met. Too see if different cars fit in he’s garage.
Hey yianny y don’t you buy an ultimae
Simple maths go on autotrader Urus is 315 mm longer .
0:37 yianni logo
I think it will fit
🔥🔥🔥
We dont own a tape measure = 6mins of content fml
I believe the coppers in the background thought you were up to no good, stopped 3 point turn
I always thought the AV was bigger than the Urus guess I was wrong 😂
Lambo sian soon land
Yianni Please buy a new supercar
Now Yianni is pissed that he gave away his Lamborghini Aventador! 😏.  Only joking!. Lol
I was way wrong!
100000%the Lamborghini will fit🤞
What if the urus goes in reverse.?
If u add a Nero kit it won’t fit
Only just fits in....
Just get the garage exctended you got plenty cash yanni
After watching this upload I can definitely say it will fit. 🤣

You forgot to say Daniel #ashville 2:31
We get it man, it fits FFS!

Yyyeesss, love the channel! Kindest regards, Richard U.K
Aventador is hella boring
Loads of room
#ASHVILLE Said to build a seller you could have had the seller as a multi car park! COME ON GET ON TO MR ASHVILLE!
🚓I’m guessing that was a police car that turned up while filming, so I’m more intrigued as to what that was doing there.😁
Fits
Hahahahahah what about when you stick on a Nero kit or front splitter ?????  Good luck Yanni 😄😂
I reckon bentayga or rolls
0:40 where is the logo??
Yes
👍
It will fit
yes
That’s without a Nero kit though
Love the police looking around 😉👍
Take it to car wow for drag race 🙏 and love the video
Fit
Yeah... but at 4:29 when you say "There's space at the back... there's space at the front..." it's still looks as tight as a fish's arse...
I don’t understand why you won’t just make the garage a bit deeper? 😂
I didn’t here about this car until now, thanks :)
I saw you in urus coming from corby to a14 way 👍👍 dammm thats niceee
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i think it could fit watching it at 3:46
It fits for me
It fits, thank me later
don't think it will fit
Fit
phew did thought it was shorter
Haha. I didn't think it would fit. Also, shouldn't your Easter be on the 25th? 😁
All that money and not a tape measure in sight…!
fit ez
Not a bloody chance
No by a inch
It will fit
Yoo why did the cop pull up?
Have your tried fitting a standard Urus in there?
which neighbour called police for mans acting suspiciously with expensive cars????!!!
In America we use tape measures...lol..
It DOES I’m guessing
Well that settles it then time to swap the urus 😂
Noice...
I think it will fit💪
I screamed in panic at 3:35 but i think it fits.
Yianni you need to buy a mini. Would be interesting if you could try to fit a normal family car in there like a bmw or an Audi.
Why are the police always watching you mate 🤔 😂😂
Love your content but!!! Still awaiting your hypercar reveal!
What about with the Nero kit?? Would it still fit??
My dude, why would I be negative about something relating to an aventador? Hells to the f*cks yeee it gon fit!
The moment we saw it fit!!
I thought Lamborghini would keep the low mid mounted exhaust for the Ultimae but they kept the Huracan like
3:48 I THINK IT WILL FIT.....
get your brick piers moved out and bring the garage doors further out and rebrick up the difference, i know its a whole lot more involved than i said but best option for a car to fit properly
Anyone else see the cop go by then stop and back up?
Get ashville back to extend the garage or you will have a heartattack  next time you try to fit
Yassss sir
Imagine if yiannis new car doesn't fit
Was this thumbnail made in Microsoft Word lol
Reverse it in much more space
c00l
I really do thing it will fit . lol
It will fit
Good . Jaajajj !! Justiniano !!!
If you got one, I would remove the lower 3 feet of drywall in the back of the garage. If it is drywall
That's what she said!
3:47 yes
R.I.P AVENTADOR
Either that that or the replacement
Yianni now doing man maths on an Aventador 😉
buy the Svj
It fits
I Think It Will Fit
Just don't fit a nero bodykit on it 😂
F the feds
So Yianni has the Aventador replacement coming? What's the size difference between the two as a couple of inches longer and it won't fit! (Pause). Thanks for sharing 👍
Welcome to the new Yianni’s game show!!!  WILL  IT  FIT?
Someone needs to look at how that garage door is fitted. The light coming through from outside when it is closed will be costing a fortune in lost heat! It wouldn’t matter if it were detached. As it is, it’s costing a fortune.
What did the Police want Yanni LOL
So in conclusion; Yianni needs to trade in the Urus for an Aventador. There's just no other solution to this problem.
U could fit a small camera and screen on the wall so u don’t have to get out , or if u don’t have help and check how much space u have
Yes
u do know u can easily get the sliding shutter door on the outside of the bricks like a shop front shutters , which would give u an easy extra 2-3 foot and extend the roof..daniel would not be shook by this work lol
Love to see a Bugatti Chiron fit in ya garage 👍
From Kenya with love 👋
Yianni is so happy now.
1st the worst 2nd the best 3rd the one with a golden gun 🤣💯👍
Easy fit for me!
Third
Will Daniel build you a bigger garage? 😂 #shout out Ashville
Will it fit?  Love your videos Yian❤️🙏
Yes I am first ☺️
