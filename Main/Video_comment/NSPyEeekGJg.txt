Clearly unfair when they put flags
chunkzzzzzz
I love how aj not knowing what a pentagon is 😭
Sharky drew all the shapes correct AJ would’ve lost this video 😭
Need this trio more
Justice for sharky
Chunkz always getting a way out sharky had better logos
Sharky got robbed
The fact that i learned more from this than i did from school today
X
Wallahi Chunkz was favored, Wallahi
Ada bendera indo cuy 🤣
i dont like videos where niko isnt on the video 😐
Seriously Chunkz is smart as fuvk😂😎😎😎
I don’t care how many times we have to find out who’s the smartest. Beta squad always 🔥
shapes and logo rounds, sharky got robbed! chunkz got points for rectangle and android fam?!?! mad.
I love Chunkz but I'm starting to dislike how he always gets the benefit of the doubt and is given more solid chances than others just cz he's more likeable 🙃
Why is HP being violated all the time
U guy's are cheating sharky
Bruh out of context Ramsey sounds hella rude but when you watch these episodes you realise how frikin patient he actually is... to
My country was mentioned in beta squad vid🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Soo glad chunkz won this episode and make a come back ❤️👏🏽👏🏽
Danm i didn't know chunks knew samoa 685
chunks vs niko
Chunkz saying Samoa jst made my day
the fact that chunks said Samoa on Yugoslavia 😪
bro gave chunkz peru and gave sharks yugoslavia ain’t no way💀😭😭
This is just a general knowledge test really. Difference between a know-it-all and someone who is genuinely smart
A square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not a square 😉
Bro sharky had milleium why did u give him wrong for that
We need part 3… it’s 1-1
Yugoslavia was an ex courtry like 30 y ago they had a war and it turned into 7 diffrent countries Bosnia Croatia Serbia Kosovo Macedonia Slovenia and Montenegro (i know that bc i live in Bosnia)
🇼🇸SAMOA🇼🇸
BRUH
they should've drawn ajs head because he is a triangle
Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Aj did Sharky so dirty this whole video lol Chunks didn’t even draw a rectangle…
I beg you to use microphones Aj 😭😭 sounds like you’re in a tin can
5:03 "call it bucks coffee" had me dead😭
for real ?? He said that the pentagon isn't correct, lol. That's the reason you should be educated folks.
I draw my pentagons just like sharky what is aj sayinnn😭😭😭
Chunks said Samoa!! Hahaha thank you for the shout out Chunkz! Lmfaooo
Did sharks dirty
aj is equally stupid any shape with 5 sides is a pentagon😭😭
Aj is too dumb to be hosting this😅
sharky got absolutely done this video LOOL yugoslavia? getting technical with his pentagon but not chunkz square?😭
Honestly, didn't think i would see my country flag, Indonesia, in an AJ video. Cheers m8!
this idea is so rinsed 😭
How didnt sharky get pentagon thats robbery
Yugoslavia isn’t a country I’ve lost all respects for this man smh
I speak on behalf of everyone, I BEG you stop using the iPhone default alarm, man thinks he’s got to be up for work n that
Aj is not capable to judge these types of competitons
Biggest spin back of the century
Yo I make funny public vids, jus startin out would appreciate if u showed some love 👊🏿💫, guarantee my vids will make u laugh🤝🫡
Big up aj man respect
Chunkz getting Peru and uganda while sharky gets Burkina Faso and yugoslavia is crazy phahahahag
I see
all because to me no one is a fool
Starbucks logo based on a mermaid 😌
As a Ugandan, I was soo happy when chunkz knew uganda and then when he sang peru😅
Why chunkz closed one eye when he laughed 😂
Yugoslavia doesn't exist anymore :)
a pentagon doesn’t actually have a specific shape😭 It’s just a shape w 5 sides💀
He should have got the point for pentagon..and technically that was a square chunks drew
Mane, i love black people so much 🌳🦆
that rectangle was robbery
Sharky's pentagon is right
NDL
sharky getting shegged, burkina faso and yugoslavia?? and chunkz gets peru and uganda? yeah…
the shape round was unfair otherwise it would have been a draw.
chunkz is such a cry baby. Just growup.
Mali gang
Who's the smartest on Beta Squad part 100
Same thumbnail, just flipped.. I respect it
How many times do u need see whos the smartest? We all know its chunkz lol
Gonna guess Sharky before I start the video!
Sharky robbed, chunks go sing for Chris brown u jokeman
is chunkz muslim?
Sharks should have got the point for pentagon. He drew a five sided shape
what about niko and kenny
Shush, none of you is smart.
Love ur vids ❤️❤️
L editor, how about u let us answer the damn questions instead of editng it in sooo fast. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oof, dethroned, chunkz is the new king of smart. Let's be fair, AJs the smart one, he has all the answers
Yesss
We need to see a Niko Vs Kenny Edition 😂
Is this an old video?
LOVE UR VIDDDSS!
aj not knowing what a pentagon is either is what kills me😭
sharky is actually so leng
Aj‘s laugh is so contagious I love it
a 10 minute video is rude😔
any shape with 5 sides is a pentagon. So technically Sharky is right
